The study was researched, con-

fessor Christopher Bradley and the 
M students enrolled in that class, and 
results were made public last week. 

Interviews were conducted via 
telephone, and of the more than 200 
calls made, 168 viable surveys were 
used to put a finger on the pulse of 
IPFW students, according to the ex- 
ecutive summary, "in order to idcnli-

STUDENT LITERARY MAGAZINE SEEKS SUBMISSIONS 



"Confluence," IPFW's student- 
run literary magazine, has been a 

perennial literary staple since 1989 
with ihe intent to "promote an added 
awareness and appreciation of the 
arts at (IPFW) and for the acknowl- 
edgement ol the creativity of both

Students have been writing and 
editing the literary magazine since 
that time, featuring genres of artistic 
expression such a_s poetry, short sto- 
nes, creative non-fiction and photog-

National Eating Disorder Awareness Week illustrates prevalence of problem 



By Stephanie Samples 
Chief Reporter 



The week of Feb. 25 to March 3 

is National Eating Disorder Aware- 
ness week, which is an opportunity to 
bring light to this epidemic. 

The driving force behind this 
week is the National Eating Disorders 
Association (NEDA), an organization 



Indiana-Purdue Student Newspapers, 
Inc. Walb Union, Suite 215 
2101 Coliseum Blvd. East 
Fort Wayne, IN 46805 



that provides information to the pub- 
lic about warning signs, causes, and 
treatments of many different e.iling 
disorder- including anorexia nervosa, 
bulimia nervosa and binge eating dis- 

NEDA also provides conferences, 
videos, books and counseling for 
people suffering from an eating dis- 
order, as welt as their families. 

This year's motto is "Be Com- 
fortable in Your Own Genes." 



The motto com ey- thai individual^ 
be comfortable in their bodies, jusi as 
NEDA speaks of people understand- 
ing that all bodies are made differ- 
ently and that our genetics prevent us 
from all looking the same. 

Along with this motto is an image 
of denim jeans that express another 
meaning, which is to he comfortable 
in your own clothes and size. 

According to the NEDA website, 
www.nationalcatingdisorders.org.

"NEDA envisions the elimination of 
eating disorders." 

The website also states. "NEDA 
is dedicated to expanding public un- 
dcr-.iauding and prevention of eating 
disorder-, and promoting access to 
quality treatineni for those affected 
alone Willi support loi their families 
through education, advocacy and re- 
search."

"In the last survey, the overwhelm- 
ing majority of students surveyed 
staled that they wanted Taco Bell, but 
a very close second choice was for a 
cafeteria," said Bradley. 

Adding a cafeteria, as well as a 
mini-mart, on campus was also a rec- 
ommended way for 1PSGA to help 
boost their image problem. 

According to the survey, another 
way for IPSGA to boost visibility is 
to explore the possibility of having 
healthier fixxl choices in campus 
vending machines. Students staled 
that they would purchase these items 
if they were available. 

Though the majority of students 
surveyed said that they fell safe on 
campus, some did illustrate a need 
for more lighting and on-site security 
officers. 

According to one survey partici- 
pant, "I do (feel safe) during the day. 
but I had night classes last year and 
it was not safe at all. It was really 
creepy (outside), and there weren't 
any security guards or anything in 

The same respondent also voiced 
curiosity as to the amount of lime it 
would take a security officer to re- 
spond to a call made from an illumi- 
nated emergency pole. 

According to the 1PFW Police 
and Safety wehsite there arefiSemer- 
l/emy telephones located tliiouelioul 
campus, 14 of winch are located out- 
side by various lots and sidewalks, 
idcuiitied by blue lights. In case of 
an emergency, an endangered person 
need only push the button lot security 
officer response. 

For full results of the 2006 under- 
graduate student survey, go to the so- 
ciology webpage at www.iim.ts iplw 
edti/hradleyc/uss. 



The website also gives statistics 
on (he effects that eating disorders 
have on Americans. The website 
states that "as many as 111 million fe- 
males and 1 million males are light- 
ing a life and death battle with an- 
orexia or bulimia." 

On the NEDA website there arc 
statistics from the National Institute 
of Health (N1H) that state ealmg dis- 
orders are becoming one of the fast- 
ing growing illnesses while at the 
same tune being one of the most un- 
derfunded. 

For example, according to NEDA 
and NIH. studies show that the preva- 
lence of eating disorders is about 10 
million Americans, and the funding is 
about 12 million dollars. 

On the same study the NIH show 
that the prevalence of Al/heimer's 
disease is 4.5 million, while the fund- 
ing is 647 million. These statistics 
show the need that endures for re- 
search funding. 

NEDA is also working toward 
persuading insurance companies to 
cover medical needs for individuals 
who are suffering from an eating dis- 

Cutrcntly very few insurance 
companies have policies that cover 
medisal and psvcholngkal treatments 
tor an individual with an eating disoi- 

ln March 2005, NEDA contract- 
ed with Global Market Insite, Inc. 
(GMI), a leader in global market re- 
search, to conduct a I .son nationwide 
sample of adults in the U.S. 

Their findings concluded from 
those surveyed that three out of four 
Americans believe eating disorders 
should be covered by insurance com- 
panies just like any other illness. 



Americans believe that govern- 
ment should require 
panics to cover i " 
ing disorders. 

Four out of 
either suffered or have known some- 
one who has suffered from an eat- 
ing disorder, according to the NEDA 
website, and NEDA and National 
Disorder Awareness Week illustrate 
the need and seriousness of this is-

Copy Editor 

"Nobody knows anything," 
said Academy Award-winner 
Bobby Moresco as he walked 
away from the lectern Mon- 
day night in the Walb Student 
Union Ballroom. 

With this humble attitude, 
Moresco addressed the au- 
dience's questions about his 
career path and writing strate- 
gies. 

Dressed casually in jeans 
and a navy IPFW hoodie, Mo- 
resco sported a friendly smile 
as he shared his experiences 
with IPFW students, staff and 
guests during the IPFW Om- 
nibus Lecture Series question 
and answer session entitled 
"One on One with Bobby Mo- 

Moresco is one of six guest 
speakers in IPFW's 1 2th season 
of the Omnibus Lecture Series. 
Recent speakers include Azar 
Nafisi, author of "Reading 
Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir 
in Books"; Seymour Hersh, a 
journalist; and Alfre Woodard, 
an Emmy Award-winning ac- 

Future speakers in this se- 
ries are Eric Schlosser, author 
of "Fast Food Nation" and Gail 
Sheehy, author of "Passages." 

Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Edna Neal introduced 



Moresco as a man who pro- 
gressed from a bartender to 
an actor to the founder of The 
Actor's Gym. a Los Angeles 
theatre company. 

Moresco began his path to 
a successful career in screen- 
writing after struggling in the 
film industry as an actor. He 
first studied the great writ- 
ers, mostly poets, for over five 
years then started playwriting. 

The public first noticed Mo- 
resco for his short-lived 1995 
series "EZ Streets," which was 
lauded by "Time Magazine" 
before its cancellation due to 
poor ratings. 

Venturing into the film in- 
dustry, Moresco co-produced 
with Paul Haggis 2004's 
"Million Dollar Baby" and 
co-wrote and produced again 
with Haggis 2005's "Crash." 
Receiving the Best Original 
Screenplay Oscar for "Crash" 
at the 78th Annual Academy 
Awards paved the way for his 
latest television project, based 
on his own teenage life in New 
York. "The Black Donnellys" 
airs next Monday, Feb. 26th at 
10 p.m. Eastern time. 

Moresco related to the audi- 
ence that "the hardest thing to 
do is write," yet he is motivat- 
ed to make edgy movies due to 
their importance. 

For instance, while the sub- 
ject of "Crash" is racism, the 
real issue raised is "strangers 



affecting strangers" and the no- 
tion of how fear drives people 
to do things they never thought 
themselves capable of. 

Similarly, "Million Dollar 
Baby" is not about assisted sui- 
cide, but "what it takes to make 
a champion." 

In his screenplays, Moresco 
gives no definitive answers 
with the purpose of asking 
questions and opening up dia- 
logue about the human experi- 

Moresco also shared that 
writing for oneself is of utmost 
importance. "Isn't that the 
way you want to approach the 
world?" he posed. 

As for writing as a team, 
Moresco stressed the commit- 
ment involved in the process. 
"Meritocracy," he said. "The 
best idea wins." 

Moresco's final advice went 
out to students. When ques- 
tioned about dropping out of 
high school, he said "Stay in 
school, because I was 54 when 
I earned my Oscar." 

Moresco lives in Los An- 
geles with his wife of 32 years 
and his two daughters. His 
latest Film, "10th and Wolf," 
which he wrote and directed, is 
currently out on DVD. 

On the political field, Mo- 
resco is scheduled in three 
weeks to hold a benefit for sol- 
diers reluming from Iraq who 
are entering the film industry.

Recently, there has been media 
frenzy over the story of Anna Nicole 
Smith's life and death. Every chan- 
nel I change to either is covering a 
story on her, or has something about 
her running across the bottom of the 
screen. I heard that over the past 
week that Anna Nicole Smith was re- 
searched online more than any other 
topic, including the war in Iraq. 

., Lc[ me start oil by saying that I 
find her story to be very sad and dev- 
astating, especially for her family. 
The men that are after her daughter 
to get to Smith's money should be 
ashamed ol themsches. but thai is all 
n going to say. 



The 



find i 



much people 

eye and somcc 
shouldn't be t 



ant to know. Some 
neant for the public 
s's personal business 
: top story of every 
news program. 

The fascination with celebrity 
culture is something that I think ev- 
eryone may fall into at some point, 
but where is the stopping point? I 
wonder if it is my generation thai is 
so fascinated, or if it has always been 
that way. 

When we had soldiers in Viet- 
nam were people more interested in 
the celebrities than the war? 1 don't 
know because I wasn't around. 
However, 1 do know what it is like 
now and it seems mote people are in- 



the war. and olfier major events like 
Hurricane Kalrina. 1 firmly believe 
that some people would have been 
almo.sl unaware of what was going 
on in New Orleans if not as many ce- 
lebrities weni down there and for dial 
we should be ashamed. 

To further prove my point, last 
week I w role an article about the Dar- 
fur tragedy. M&gt; lirsi .inempi lo write 
an article on thai topic was slopped 
because 1 was going to include stu- 
dents' opinions and knowledge of (lie 
situation. It turns out that I could find 
few that knew much 



in need. I don't blame just people, issui 

or just media for these problems; I ' 

know it is a little of both. I do believe of v 

that it is our responsibility lo inform us. I 

ourselves. In the future the war, en- stori 

vironmental issues and illnesses will sion 

become even more prevalent in our I

wrong with a little fluff-it's fun and

fluff gels in the way of what is real

: no students 
of the Darfur tragedy, but 
who is dating whom in Hoik wood

The obsession with celebrity is 
silly what are they doing that is so 
important? It is sad, because it is a 
waste of time. Sure it's fun to listen 
to a little gossip or watch something 
that doesn't require thinking, but if 
this is the majority of what we are 
taking in. then that's scary. 

Like it or not, we are no longer

Why do students spend away their futures?

do people really do that? 

People intentionally get credit 
curds just to max I hem out? I mean, 
yes, we gel credit cards for a reason, 
but (hat reason is to establish credit 
for yourself or to make a big pur- 
chase that is paid off in installments 
(such as a computer), not just to have 
a spending spree at the mall. 

After thinking about it, I started 
to wonder why 1 have a credit card I 
orientally got H to save a decent sum 
of money on a few purchases, which 
I paid off thai day Then. I slopped 

Then I was starting a new job 

and in the process of switching jobs 
and getting my lirsi paycheck, I had 
to put some of my bills on said card. 
Now, over two years later, I am about 
to pay the rest of il off. It was never 
niaxed out, nor did I even charge

est gruff. I held myself back, because 
I think that '-veryone needs to learn 
life lessons on his and her own. 

J also started to think of a very 
young married couple that I know, 
and they have amassed thousands 
in credit card debt for all the latest 
things, including the nicest furniture 
for their pad. 

Whatever happened to gelling Ihe 
li,ind-me-downs from the basement

you need? Then, when you could af- 
ford the nice things, you got them. In 
the society wc live in now. it seems 
(hat no one wants to work for any-

For many young women nowa-

What has sex

By Said El-Dajani 
Managing Editor 



I've been avoiding the new look 
and atmosphere ol Target for various 
reasons. I watch their commercials 
and read their ads, not in disappoint- 
ment, but in fear thai I may fall inio 
their trap of aesthetic marketing. 

Wc live in a world of deception 
layers. Money making 









kcipluee leaving :i.e average human 
to decipher il all. Our brains are 
geared for something, and so they 
arc constantly manipulated. With no 
conscious control, we end up making 
decisions to buy based on what our 
biology tells us. 

So the question I pose is this: 
Are we robots? 

Since there is no such thing as a 
stupid question, I thought it would be 
fun to ponder this abstract inquiry. 
Robots, lirst and foremost, are pro- 
grammed. While we humans do not 
literally have USB ports lo upload in- 
formation, we have eves and ears thai 
act as makeshift information-getters. 
Throughout our lifetimes, these two 
sense mediums develop and inherit 
data Ihe same way computers and ro- 
bots do. Fascinated yet? 

Once programmed, wc have the 
ability to maintain and perform tasks, 
sometimes for extended periods of 
time, after which we recharge. 
We get sick like computers do. They 
gel viruses, while we have the chance 
for bacteria. While robots cannot 
clearly reproduce the same way hu- 
mans do, humans definitely have the 
ability make love like robots (please 
don't judge me). 

All I'm trying to say is that our 
world is becoming so savvy for the 
normal person, who is increasingly 
distanced from others in this age of 
infnrjn.it ion. What happens to a com- 
puter that exceeds hs limits? It could 
potentially crash.

'Dark Messiah: Might and Magic' treads unfamiliar ground

was released over 20 years ;i«o for

"Ultima" and "The Bard's Talc" were

genre, featuring a vast world to ex-

as well as many strategic facets not 
previously seen. "Might and Magic" 
cemented its status as legendary. 

Now, after eight sequels and live 
spin-off games, the series has rein- 
vented itself once more with "Dark 
Messiah: Might and Magic." 

Developed by Ubisoft, "Dark

named Sarcth. Under the watch of the

Spartanburg, SC- The Wofford Tcrri- 
swept IPFW in the Mastodons' season 
rjpening double-header today in Spartan- 
burg, South Carolina. Wofford used a 12- 
third inning to top the 'Dons 19-1 in 
the opener, and two Terrier hurlers com- 
bined for a no-hitter in the nightcap to win 

Wofford 3rd baseman Brandon Waring 
slugged three homers in the opener, two as 
mrt of the Terriers' 12-run uprising in the 
3rd inning. 

Catcher Keith Munns added a three-run 
shot in the frame. 

Waring finished the game going 4-4 
with five runs scored and 5 RBI. 

IPFW's lone run came in the fourth as 
junior center fielder Jarcd Davis started off 
[he frame with a double down the left field 
line. Senior catcher Tony Nichting singled 



Day Two: Swept without a defense 



half to establish tll.il tins is our game 
We allowed them to take control 
and when we hit the long stretch of 
mi-.cd baskets, like most teams do. 
we needed to defend better. 

"The technical foul was good lor 
us, when Ashley Johnson made four 
free throws it brought us back into 
the game. Wc told them that good 
teams take control to win and we jusl 
couldn't lake control Wc didn't make 
enough plays and UTM did." 

Lewis-Carlisle led the 'Dons of- 
fensively with 23 points. She 
of 6 from the arc and 2 of 3 at the 

Johnson connected for 13 points 
and was perfect at the line, 4-4. She 
was 4 of / from the held with live 
boards and five assists. 

The Skyhawks finished with one 
double-double and two oilier ladies 
in double figures Crystal Fuller con- 
nected for 211 points and II boards. 




Carolina Style 
falls in opener 

down the right field line, with two outs in 
the inning, to chase Davis home. 

The Mastodons opened up game two 
with an unearned run in the first inning. 

Sophomore left fielder Quenlin Brown 
walked and advanced to third on an error 
after a bunt attempt by senior shortstop 
Chris Venvertloh. 

Brown would score as a failed pickoff 
attempt by Wofford catcher Adam Kearney 
sailed into left field. 

The Mastodons' lead lasted just one 
batter. Terrier right fielder Sterling Dye 
homered to left field, tying it at one. 

Wofford (6-2) got two more in the in- 
ning and added insurance runs in the 5th 
and dth innings lor the 5-1 win. 

Ben Austin threw five no-hit innings, 
and Lance Player came on to no-hit the 
'Dons in the final two. 

IPFW (0-2) will look to rebound with 
a single nine-inning game 



Spartanburg, SC - The IPFW baseball 
dug themselves another huge hole against 
Wofford on Sunday afternoon. While they 
wouldn't quite dig their way out, the 'Dons 
did finally generate some offense in a 19- 

The Terriers put up an eight-spot in the 
irst inning. Senior John Brandt knocked 

three with a bases loaded single, and 
right fielder Sterling Dye launched a three- 
n homer to left field. 

Trailing 10-0, IPFW got on the board 
the third as sophomore left fielder Quen- 
i Brown singled home second baseman 
Mark Carden from third. 

Unfortunately, the 'Dons gave up four 

re in the bottom half of the inning to 
rail 14-1. 

IPFW was at the bottom of an 18-1 hill 
aefore Head Coach Billy Gernon said they 
'kind of found themselves offensively". 

Junior centerfielder Jared Davis began 
Ihe comeback with a two-run shot to left in 
the 6th inning. 

IPFW got two more in the 7th inning on 

RBI single from junior DH Aaron Kems 
and another RBI from Davis. 

The Mastodons gave one back in the 
DOttom half of the seventh, but got two 

re in the 8th inning. 

Freshman right * fielder Shaun 
VanDriessche drove home two with a sin- 
gle that plated senior Tony Nichting and 
freshman Mark Carden. 

IPFW (0-3) did not go quitely in the 
ninth. Junior first baseman Nick Mill- 
ipaugh opened the scoring with an RBI 



sacrifice line-out to left that scored Davis 
from third. 

Carden roped an RBI single to right 
field. 

Freshman third baseman Jason Doerf- 
fler ripped a two-run single lo centerfield 
that scored Carden and VanDriessche. 

The big blow of the inning came off 
the bat of Kerns, who launched a three-run 
blast to left, making it 19-14. 

The 'Dons looked poised to get a cou- 
ple more, but the bounces didn't go their 
way. After a single from Davis, Mill- 
spaugh laced a shot headed up the middle, 
but it caromed off pitcher Dawson Smith to 
shortstop Michael Gilmanin, who threw on 
to Neil Robinette for the win. 

Kems was 3-6 with four RBI. 

Carden finished the game 4-5 with four 
runs scored and an RBI. 

Doerffler was 3-5 with two runs scored 
and two RBI, and freshman Ryan Beer 
came on to relieve Brown in left and went 
3-3 with a run scored. 

Sophomore righthander Stacy Herrold 
was about the only Mastodon hurler to keep 
Wofford in check on the weekend. Herrold 
pitched four innings, giving up four hits 
and two runs, while striking out three. 

Starter Jake Hollander took the loss. 

Wofford (7-2) starter Zach Parmer got 
his second win of the year, going six com- 
plete, giving up three runs on eight hits. 

It doesn't get any easier for IPFW. The 
Mastodons travel to Knoxville, Tennessee 
next weekend for a three-game set with the 
powerhouse Volunteers of Tennessee.
