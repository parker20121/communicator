What you shoit id know a bout the new proposeig'iEbnstitutlon 



By Said Et-Dajani 

KldajaniCgnuil.com 

Since 1999, IPFW 
has undergone serious 
changed. Adding stu- 
dent housing for one 
has diversified IPFW's 
campus. There has been 
an increase in admis- 
sions, sporting event at- 
tendance, and organiza- 
tions on campus since 
the turn of the century 
and the Student Gov- 
ernment has recognized 
it. With this change and 
progression, the Stu- 
dent Government start- 
ed questioning. 

Does the Constitution 
really fit us? 

The current Osnstilu- 
don of the IPSGA was 
amended last on No- 
vember 1, 1999, and a 
proposed new Constitu- 
tion was first discussed 



three yea rs-a go; 

The ratification and 
implementation of a 
recently proposed con- 
stitution will serve as a 
new layout and orga- 
nized tool for students 
and staff to refer to. This 
article will serve as a ref- 
erence to the proposed 
Constitution, currentiy 
endorsed by the Student 
Senate, the Executive 
Branch, and, as of Nov. 5, 
the Judicial Branch oFihe 
Indiana- Purdue Student 
Government Association 
(IPSGA). 

The overall new layout 
consists of many minor 
changes to the organi- 
zation and emphasis of 
information. The execu- 
tive branch of the IPSGA. 
consisting of the Student 
Body President, die Stu- 
dent Body Vice Presi- 
dent, the Student Body 



Comptroller, and-^*e.^;=SGA'Bnd it^-actlve mem- 



Student Body Program- 
ming Director, represent 
the student body, and 
will be taking advantage 
of homecoming week 
to get students involved 
and educated about the 
universit/s government, 
Aaron Williamson, the 
Student Body President 
has been working dili- 
gentiy to achieve this 
goal. 

"Ultimately," he says, 
"We want the student 
body to approve the Con- 
stitution." 

According to Article 
XIV: Ratification, the 
proposed constitution is 
dependent upon an ac- 
ceptance of five percent 
by the currentiy enrolled 
student body of IPFW. 
The current Constitu- 
tion only recogruzes the 
branches within the IP- 



bers to ratify and bind 
with a two-thirds vote. 

Another change is the 
number of signatures 
needed to qualify for Stu- 
dent Senate. While the 
old Constitution only re- 
quires SO signatures, the 
proposed one challenges 
100. 

"Representing the stu- 
dent body is very Im- 
portant," explained Wil- 
liamson. "The nimiber 
represents a commit- 
tment to the position- 
we're raising the bar." 

Unfortunteiy, not all 
members within Student 
Government are on the 
same page. The Students 
Activity Board (SAB), a 
key branch to the IPGSA, 
has chosen not to en- 
dorse the proposed Con- 
stitution. A dual mem- 
bership is not an option 



in this new document. 
This means one cannot 
be a voting member of 
both the Student Senate 
and the Students Activ- 
ity Board. The proposed 
Constitution essentially 
takes out double voting. 
While this may end up 
being the most contro- 
versial issue, on a finan- 
ci£d note, the proposed 
Constitution recognizes 
two important Commit- 
tees : the Allocation Com- 
mittee and the Home- 
comingCommittee.They 
both existed, but never in 
the Constitution. 

Why are they impor- 
tant? 

TYy the fact that the 
Allocation Conmiittee 
makes recommenda- 
tions to the University 
for the expenditiure of 
40 percent of the Student 
Service Fee. That sum is 



rougly a million dollars] 
and it is the students of 
this University who have 
the opportunity to see 
where it should go. 

What about the 575,000 
budget the Homecoming 
Committee has? 

The proposed Constitu- 
ion is more user friendly 
in that it gives the stu- 
dent body more recog- 
nition and potentionallyi 
more opportunities. 

Opportunies and In-^ 
volvement according to, 
the IPSGA. are not thali 
hard to come by. and our 
executive branch isstriv-i 
ing to show that to ouc 
student body. i 

"The goals and theraa 
is a transparent govern^ 
ment," concluded wM 
liamson. I

New file-sharing bill enters Congress 

Bill may have impact on how college students download information 



ByDAVIDJ.SMOUNSKY 

U'WIRE 



Monihs after a bill thai 
could have required uni- 
versities to police stu- 
dent downloaders was 
dropped on Capitol Hill, 
universities are already 
bracing for round two. 

Lasl week, Rep. Ric 
Keller (R-Fla.) and Rep. 
Howard P. McKeon IR- 
Calif.) proposed the Col- 
lege Access and Oppor- 
tunity' Act, a measure that 
would require universi- 
ties to monitor students' 
online activity for illegal 
file -sharing. 

The bill echoes Senate 
Majority Leader Harry 
Reid's (D-Nev.) proposal. 



which was withdrawn 
in July after vocal oppo- 
sition from universities 
and across the country. 

Wendy Seltzer, a fellow 
at Harvard Law School's 
Berknian Center for In-

in an e-mail that such 
legislation could "limit

"It would require them

with the highest number 
of copyright infringement

These institutions woidd 
be required to inform 
students of their illegal

it has dealt internally 
with a handful of copy-

The University has not

The bill has been met 
with criticism from uni- 
versities nationwide, 
public advocacy groups, 
and major corporations 
including Apple, Micro-

Some in the entertain- 
ment industry see the 
legislation as a step for- 
ward in the fight against 
piracy on college cam- 
puses. 

Angela B. Martinez, 
spokeswoman for the 
Motion Picture Associa- 
tion of America, said 44 
percent of digital piracy 
occurs on college cam- 
puses. 

"Many universities are 
taxpayer- subsidized," 
she said, "and therefore 



should be concerned if 
illegal content is being 
passed over networks." 

Steven L. Worona, di- 
rector of policy and net- 
working programs for 
a nonprofit called Edu- 
cause, said universities 
should be able to craft 
their own anti-piracy 
policies, rather than us- 
ing blanket legislation. 

Tim R. Hwang '08, 
member of Harvard Free 
Culture, said the bill 
compromised the role of 
educators. 

"IWlhen universities 
violate the privacy of stu- 
dents... they 're complicit 
in a kind of legalized 
thuggery that poisons 
[heir role as educational 
institutions," he wrote in

Poking The President? Students tune into 2008 election 



ByJEANNIENUSS 

U-WIRE 



"Mitt Romney added 
you as a friend on Face- 
book." 

Coming home from 
class and logging on to 
a friend request from a 
presidential candidate 
(or minion operating his 
or her profile} is prob- 
ably unsurprising, to say 
the least. - 

As is browsing YouTube 
and seeing coundess vid- 
eo clips of Hilary Clinton 
debating key political 
issues... and clips slam- 
ming her on the same 
ones. And MySpace vid- 
eo interviews featuring 
Barack Obama. 

The 2008 presidential 
election is less than a 
year away, and is already 
a presence on college 
campuses as politicians 
on the trail court the 



younger set more than 
ever. 

Although the 2004 
-presidential election 
race helped push col- 
lege students toward 
a more grassroots ef- 
fort in supporting their 
respective candidates, 
2008 is taking it to a new 
level. 

Thanks the explo- 
sion of popular online 
networking sites dur- 
ing this term, reaching 
thousands has never 
been easier. 

But reaching out to 
young voters will de- 
pend on more than 
just technological ad- 
vancements: College 
students, including 
those at Boston Univer- 
sity, are pushing their 
own agendas in the real 
world as much as die 
virtual one. 

Though many have 
called out students for 
being more interested 



in rioting for the Bed Sox 
than protesting for peace, 
statistics suggest this gen- 
eration is actually on par 
with the generation be- 
fore it in paying attention 
to politics. 

According to a Septem- 
ber 2007 Pew Research 
Center survey, 38 percent 
of 18- to 29-year-olds 
watch candidate debates, 
while 36 percent of 30- to 
49-year-olds do so. 

"People like to label this 
generation as apathetic a 
bit too much," said Bos- 
ton University College 
Democrats president Rani 
Woods. 

"College students are en- 
gaged," Woods, a College 
of Arts and Sciences se- 
nior, said, "We may not all 
be out at the war protest, 
but whether it be Darfur 
or the environment, we 
care." 

In 2004. 49 percent of 18- 
to 29-year-olds voted in 
the presidential election 




— a number that records 
from the Center for Infor- 
mation and Research on 
Civil Learning and En- 
gagement show as on the 
way to re-emerging from 
the voting doldrums of 
the late '90s, when only 
about 40 percent voted, 
to overtake the 52 per- 



cent who voted in 1992. 

Part of the reason for 
the renewed interest 
in politics could stem 
from widespread dissat- 
isfaction with the Bush 
Administration, which 
has created a dialogue 
among everyone from 
baby boomers to high- 



school grads about the 
handling of the country. 
"College students have 
gone through a similar 
revolution as the Ameri- 
can people have," Woods 
said. "Do I think that 
Bush's presidency has 
created more activists? 
Absolutely." 



Colbert denied South Carolina ballot bid 



By JESS DAVIS 

U-WIRE 



Stephen Colben can't 
run for president in 
South Carolina's Demo- 
cratic primary, the state 
Democratic Party said 
Thursday. 

The executive commit-

Colbert announced 
a couple of weeks ago

Republican and Demo- 
cratic primaries.

that he did not have a na-

Colbert had made only

But others said it was

the parties have the right 
to set their own rules and 
things like that," said Al- 
len Klump, a fourth-year

so he hasn't lost his right 



to run. 

But, "Do I think they

Klump said. "No, they

Colonel Sanders: 

Defending animal cruelty? 



By Kelly McLendon 



With the latest allega- 
tions concerning dog 
fighting, many other cas- 
es 

of animal abuse are also 
circulating the media. For 
example, take a 
site called "Kentucky 
Fried Cruelty." The aim of 
this site is to 

discourage readers from 
purchasing anything 
from the chicken 
restaurant, Kentucky 
Fried Chicken; because 
the company has 
been 



found 
to process chicken in an 
inhumane manner. 
"KFC lets frustrated fac- 
tory-farm and slaughter- 
house workers handle 
live birds, so many of the 
animals end up being 
sadistically abused.

claim- 



ing that. 
"Chickens' throats are 
slit and the animals are 
dropped into tanks of 
scalding-hot water to re- 
move their feathers, often 
while they are 
still conscious and able to 
feel pain." 

"It's evil that some people 
would not even consider 
the chickens' 

feelings." freshman Aman- 
da Liepe said. 
So, what does KFC have 
to say about these allega- 
tions? 

The company website 
states, "As a major pur- 
chaser of food products, 
we 

have the opportunity, and 
responsibility, to influence 
the way animals 
supplied to us are 
treated. We 
take 



that responsibility very 
seriously, and we are 
monitoring our suppliers 
on an ongoing basis to 
determine whether our 
suppliers are using hu- 
mane procedures for car- 
ing 

for and handling animals

There is also a KFC Ani- 
mal Welfare Advisory 
Council in order, to more 
closely monitor the treat- 
ment of animals from the 
restaurant chain's 
suppliers.

There are many books out 
today which detail animal 
cruelty and the 
companies who let it hap- 
pen without doing any- 
thing to change it. Last 
year, author Eric Schloss-

the Omnibus Lecture

New DVD Releases Reviewed 



By AARON THOMAS 



140B 

First off, props to John Cusack,. Not 
since "Castaway" have I seen a film so 
well carried by one actor's inspired per- 
formance. 

An author who is traveling from one 
"haunted" place to another 
in search of experiencing a 
paranormal event, is tipped 
off anonymously about a 
room at The Dolphin in 
New York City, where tliere 
have been over 50 deaths 
and each person has lasted 
no more than an hour in- 
side the room. 

The skeptic ignores all 
pleas of the owner (Samuel 
L Jackson) to not stay in the 
room and decides to expe- 
rience the phenomena for 
himself. 

What Cakes place in his 
room is a psychological 
journey through fear and 
desperation. 

The room is not a gateway to hell 
as the advertising might make you be- 
lieve, it is a gateway to the darkest parts 
of your mind, from which 
most people would never 
be able to come back. 

Ratatouille 

Easily a contender for 
best film of the year, Pix- 
ar has proven itself once 
again of being able to go 
above and beyond expec- 
tations. 

This is the best film this 
company has produced 
since "Finding Nemo", 
which this film also shares 
certain characteristics 
with. It's more charac- 
ter-driven than it is joke- 
driven. That is to say, this is not a series 
of jokes put into a mo^rie, rather this is 



a movie about characters who just hap- 
pen to all be really funny. 

The film relies on a natural chem- 
istry between the actors, which results 
in the wonderful tradition of shtick. To 
each character their own unique set of 
quirks and behaviors that lead them to 
be funny in a natural way, which will last 
longer with you than any knock-knock 
jock would. 

I've gone this long and I haven't even 
mentioned the plot, Remy is a rat that 
lives in a colony of 
other rats who eat 
what most rats do: 
garbage. But Remy 
has a palette more 
sophisticated than 
.inyofthe other rats 
could ever hope for. 
[ le eventually meets 
up with Linguini, 
who works at a res- 
inurant and proba- 
bly couldn't heat up 
a microwave dinner 
un iiis own without 
help. Remy desires 
to work in an in- 
dustry that doesn't 
want him, and Lin- 
guini wants the natural skills that Remy 
has, so they must establish a secret pan- 
ne rship. 

What results is a film that celebrates 

dreams, friendship, 

work, honesty, and 
romance. 



Sicko 

1 met someone 
recently who could 
have been in this 
film. He was training 
for a triathlon, so it's 
fair to say that he was 
in good health, but 
he had an accident 
that involved falling 
otf of his bike and 
hurting his back. His 
newly- acquired inju- 
ry that requires a $104,000 surgery to fix 





has now resulted in him being dropped 
by his healthcare company because they 
told him his back injury was a pre-exist- 
ingcondition. That said, on to the 
review: This is Michael 
Moore at his best, at his 
most noble. One way that 
he's improved: he's in the 
movie less. 

I know that Moore 
technically made the 
film, but almost the en- 
tire movie is simply peo- 
ple telling stories from 
different perspectives 
regarding the health care 
industry. 

Some people were 
lied to by the companies, 
some people were ma- 
nipulated, some people 
worked for the compa- 
nies, some just live in other countries, 
and some are dead. This is a movie 
about those who have suffered from a 
heartiess, money-hungry industry that 
should never have been profit-driven to 
begin with.This is the only industrialized 
nation to not have a na- 
tional health care system, 
and Moore believes our 
citizens suffer because of 
it. This point is pressed 
time and time again with 
each story that comes 
from those who will never 
forget the injuries they 
incurred from a group of 
businessmen who seem 
to care as much about 
their customers as lames 
Bond cares about traffic 
laws. 

Moore shows up even- 
rually to carry us a little 
further on through our 
journey, as he takes a group 
of 9/11 rescue workers, who have been 
dropped by their health care compa- 
nies, to Guantanomo Bay where terror- 
ists held captive by America are given 
world-class health care for free. He takes 
us to Canada to visit their clinics, and to 
England. 

This is the documentary that he has 



been trying to make for a very long time 
and he succeeds in every respect. You 
owe it to yourself, Moore fan or not, to 
see this film. 



MICHAEL MOORB 




Sunshine 

The Sun is dying 
and needs to be given 
a proverbial kick-stan 
from the crew of llie 
Icarus II, so that Earth 
does not freeze and 
kill everything on the 
planet. 

That is the cen- 
tral conflict in Danny 
Boyle's latest directo- 
rial effort, in which he 
teams up once again 
with "28 Days Later" 
WTiterAlexGariand. 
This film is much less about the mis- 
sion itself (as in "Armageddon") than it is 
about the crew's drive to see it through 
to the end. 

Things get much more complicated 
though when they find the original Ica- 
rus, which was the ship 
sent a few years before 
them on the same mis- 
sion but mysteriously 
vanished. 

This film has 
some of the best cin- 
ematography work 
I've seen in quite some 
time, and it's being put 
to good use by a direc- 
tor who used it to make 
one of the most intense 
movies I've seen in 
quite a while. 

The film is also 
done very efficiently, 
it gives you enough 
of each character that 
each one is interesting in their oivn right, 
but never giving you so much that you're 
ever distracted from the issues at hand. 
You may have trouble looking away for 
at least the last 45 minutes or so. 

Danny Boyle is one of the best direc- 
tors working today, and this film does 
nothing but further that claim.

Purely Dance 2007 



By ZACHARY HORNBACK 



Dance is often choreographed 



chose music and choreographed 
dancers to convey the artwork 
to the audience. There are six 
separate dances within the show, 
each to a different work of art. 
The artwork featured throughout 



to music to represent emotions the performance is also show- 
and feelings and tell some kind of cased in the atrium of the Studio 



a story. In Pure- 
ly Dance 2007 
the only differ- 
ence is that that 
the music and 
the dance are 
both based on 
other artwork. 
The concept that is defined in 
Purely Dance 2007 is one in 
which the choreographers chose 
artwork - paintings, a collage of 
photos or made-up ads, even a 
woodblock printing - and then 



Purely Dance 2007 is being 
performed at the Studio 

Theatre in Kettler Hall on 
November 9, 10, and 11.

It's not often that a television commer- 
cial, of alJ things, can shake up my hold 
on reality. I saw a commercial recendy for 
the company Dove. Simply put; it's a 60- 
second reality punch. Here it is: 
Enter a woman about 30 yeais old who 
looks like she has just rolled out of bed. 
She looks to be at a healthy weight, has 
dirty-blonde hair, and would probably 
not strike anyone as a typical model. She 
is led into a studio and sits down on a 
stool in front ofa while screen. 
The next 15 seconds are a time-lapse 
of two to five hours worth of hair and 
make-up work: wash her hair and 
hold it back so they can cover up 
every square inch of her face 
with a cream or a powder 
thai masks anything that 
resembles an imperfec- r , ; i^,- 
tion, mascara, lip gloss, ////// 
fake eye lashes; then ^ /M '/ 
comb, color and curl 
her hair. 

Three more seconds

four hours worth of 
shooting.

onds are a time

hours worth 
of Photoshop

for the first time, when I see a magazine 
cover or a printed ad, and I think back to 
this woman who looked rather ordinary 
to start out and was then mutated into 
a massive force-feeding of what society 
tells us a woman is "supposed 
to look like." 
This commercial, 



Caimes Advertising Awards, is part of a 
larger campaign headed by Dove to get 

resources out to women of all ages about

and psychological problems from eadng

refreshing things I've seen in a while. 
I'm tired of being smashed in with the 
lowest common denominator and hav-

of my hopes and desires by eating fast 
food, buying an over-priced car, and 
cramming my life full of products that 
are nothing but non- enlightening, dead 
end time killers.

Mast Important inter- 
ception: Geno Hayes. 
Florida State 
As Saturday night passed 
into Sunday morning, 
the Seminoles celebrated 
the weekend's biggest 
upset — how odd is that? 
— and their first road win 
against a top-5 opponent 
in eight years. Hayes 
clinched it by jumping a 
crossing route over the 
middle, stealing the ball 
from BC tight end Ryan 
Purvis and running 38 
yards for a touchdown 
that ensured Matt Ryan 
and the Eagles would 
not escape with a second 
straight comeback win. 
Unluckiest number: 2 
Five teams have lost this 



fall while being ranked 
second in the nation. 
That's Boston College, 
use, Cal, LSU and "Flor- 
ida Southern," as Brent 
Musberger said on ABC 
as the Eagles were going 
doivn. 
Best strip sack: Chad 
Jones, LSU 
The Saban Bowl was tied 
at 34 when )ones — a 
freshman safety and Les 
Miles recruit — came up 
tlie middle to sack Ala- 
bama's John Parker Wil- 
son and force a fumble 
near the Tide goal line. 
Curtis Taylor recovered 
for the Tigers at the 4- 
yard line, and )acob Hes- 
ter's subsequent TD run 
gave Gambling Les yet 
another tight ivin. 

Going streaking: Notre 
Dame 
The 43-game win streak 




against Navy is dead, but 
the Irish have a chance to 
make more history next 
week against Air Force. 
The last time they lost 
to more than one ser- 
vice academy was 1944. 
I mean. Hitler was still 
alive. 

Longest bloodlines: 
Brady Leaf, Oregon 
The Ducks deserve some 
real analysis and/or 
praise, but 1 can't get over 
the fact that Ryan Leaf's 
little brother is still in col- 
lege. QB Leaf II, who fin- 
ished up for Oregon after 
Dennis Dixon tweaked 
his knee, is 22. His older 
brother is 29. ... OK, I 
guess that's not so bad, 
but doesn't it feel like for- 
ever since Ryan Leaf ex- 
isted? It was 10 years ago 
that he was a supernova 
quarterback at Washing- 
ton State. 

Really, really good 
running back: Mike 



Hart, Michigan 
Sometimes a guy gets 
mentioned early as a 
Heisman candidate and 
just kind of stays in the 
race because he and his 
team are famous. Hart's. 
got those factors working 
for him, of course, but he 
is simply a tremendous 
running back, even with 
a bum ankle. 
Better lucky than good: 

Virginia 
The Cavaliers regained 
first place in the ACC 
Coastal Division, win- 
ning after Mikell Simp- 
son scored on a short 
run and All-ACC kicker 
Sam Swank missed from 
47 yards as time expired. 
It was UVa's fifth win by 
two points or less, which 
breaks the NCAA record 
of four set by Colum- 
bia in 1971. (Colimibia? 
Weird.) 

Surprisingly deep: 
Kansas 



You know about Arkan- 
sas' dynamic tailback 
duo and the dangerous 
QB-RB tandem at West 
Virginia. But did you 
know that KU is the only 
other team \vith multiple 
600-yard rushers? Bran- 
don McAnderson has 807 
rushing yards (6.4 per 
carry) and lake Sharp has 
661 (5.7). 
Easiest catch: Connor 
Bar.vin, Cincinnati 
South Florida's seventh 
turnovercamewhen punt 
returner Marcus Edwards 
had the ball bounce di- 
rectly off his chest... and 
right to Barvvin, the first 
man down to cover the 
kick. The Bulls turned the 
ball over an eighth time, 
but somehow still had a 
chance to win the game 
with two throws into the 
end zone.
