oul by the National League of 
Nursing. I 

The diploma programs in Fort 
Wayne are offered through Saint 
Joseph, Lutheran and Parkview 
hospitals. They differ from what's 
offered at Purdue because they are 
not degree programs and usually 
take longer to complete since they 
involve more clinical work. 

Elaine Cowen, Department 
Chairwoman of the Purdue Nursing 
program, feels the program at 
Purdue is more popular because 
students are able to attend part time 
and take three to four years to 
graduate. Another advantage is that 
students can complete all their 
nursing here, at a local campus, to 
includea (our year-degree. 

The diploma programs have a set, 
full-time curriculum. This is a 
disadvantage to women returning to 
school after having a family. Last 
year, approximately 52 percent of 
the women enrolled in their second 
year of nursing were mothers, ac- 
cording to records kept by Cowen.

The Purdue University nursing 
program offered at IPFW is unique 
in the Fort Waynearea 

It is a two year RN degree 
program thatcombines both nursing 
theory and clinical practice 
thospital training). No other 
program in this region offers a two 
year degree. Most prospective 
nursing students seem to prefer this 
type of training because Purdue's 
enrollment is the largest in the city. 
Records show that it graduates 
approximately 120 students a year. 

An article in the Summer 1978 
Journal of College Placements 
stated there is a trend away from the 
hospital diploma program and 
towards degree programs for RN's. 
In fact, the article predicted that by 
1985 "hospital nursing programs will 
beaming of the past." 

Fort Wayne, contrary to this 
trend, houses three diploma 
programs and only one 2 year 
degree program. This trend does 
show up statewide. There are five 
diploma and 11 degree programs in

Crawford applies nursing skill 



ByCHERYLGlBSON 
Chief Reporter 

With the help of the women's 
movement, job roles for women are 
changing. Men are changing job 
roles, too. 

One such man is 24-year-old Mae 
Crawford. He will graduate in May 
from the IPFW nursing program. 

Crawford became interested in 
nursing as a career after taking an 
Emergency Medical Technology 
(EMT) course at Ivy Tech. He had 
ambitions to become a paramedic so 
he turned to nursing to give him a . 
medical background. 

He works at Parkview Memorial 
Hospital and many patients mistake 
him for a doctor, but he quickly 
corrects them and says he is a male 
nurse. 

He selected IPFW's nursing 
program because he is given college 
credit which will help him achieve a 
master's degree. Crawford is 
considering specializing in 
anc-sthcsiology. 

Crawford pointed out that the 
IPFW nursing program differs from 
other area programs, Hesaidlhatat

more clinical experience than 
classroom work. He chose IPFW

In a portion of the Student Senate 
meeting Feb. 18 from which non-voting 
Students' Government members, a 
media representative and guests were 
barred, the Senate voted in a resolution 
to raise the student activity fee from Sis 
toS20bya6-3vote. 

After a protest of the closing of the 
session to the outsiders, the Senate 
voted to repeal the decision, and the 
vote on the passage of the resolution to 
raise the fee was tabled 

The Feb. 12 issue of The Com- 
municator reported that a temporary 
ad hoc committee, consisting of 
Senators Ellen Engleman, Ken Schenk 
and Roger Meriwether, was to in- 
vestigate the possibility of raising the 
activity fee because of inflation and the 
addition of the Health, Physical 
Education, and Recreation (HPER) 
Building. 

The committee came up with a 
resolution to raise the activity fee paid 
by full-time students from $15 to $20 
which calls for the collected funds from 
the $20 fee to be split 50-50 between the 
athletic department and student ac- 
tivities for a period of two years. After 
two years, the funds would be changed 
to a 55 percent activity and 45 percent 
athletic department split. 

The resolution also states why the 
committee recommends the increase in 
funds for the athletic department and 
not for the activities division of the 
budget, saying that the HPER building 
activities will increase the need of that 
department. 



Senate votes, revotes 
on activity fee proposal 



After the resolution was read by 
Senator Engleman, the Senate decided 
to have a closed session for discussion 
from which all non-voting members 
and guests were barred. Among the 
people asked to leave were Student 
Body President Ann Momper, SUBOG 
i- hairperson Kathy Ertel, John Ulmer, 
dean of Student Services, Athletic 
Director Dave Skelton, Communicator 
reporter Jim Chapman and a student 
guest. 

When the closed session was over and 
those expelled were invited back into 
the meeting, the Senators announced 
they had passed the resolution by a 6-3 
vote. 

Momper then protested the closing of 
the session to the outsiders, and the 
Senate then repealed the passage of the 
resolution. 

Engleman and Schenk then agreed to 
relate any of the discussion occurring 
during the closed session. 

After more discussion among the 
senators and guests, the Senate ap- 
peared to have mixed emotions on 
whether or not to vote on the resolution. 

Senator Mark Wells then made a 
motion to table the resolution and the 
majority of the Senateagreed. 

If the resolution is passed. Dean 
Ulmer will pass it on to Chancellor 
Joseph P. Giusti for his approval. 
Chancellor Giusti will then pass the 
increase proposal on to Purdue, West 
Lafayette, where final approval is 
made. 

In another resolution presented at the 
Feb. 18 Student Senate meeting, the 



Advocates side-up 
on abortion issue 



Senate voted to approve IPFW's 
Students' Government's membership 
Into the Statewide Student Lobbying 
Agenda Steering committee. 

The steering committee will consist 
of one representative from each college 
or university in the state thatadopts the 
student agenda. 

The student agenda will consist of 
legislation, determined by a general 
consensus of participants, to be of in- 
terest to students in institutions of 
higher education within Indiana. 

The agenda will be set at a general 
conference to be held each year at 
approximately the same time as 
the opening of the session of the Indiana 
General Assembly. 

Steve Westrick was chosen as IP- 
FW's representative to the committee. 

Westrick will take the consensus 
opinions of IPFW's Students' Govern- 
ment to the steering committee. 

The consensus opinions will be 
decided by the student body president, 
vice president and chairperson of the 
Legislative Affairs Committee. 

If a consensus cannot be reached 
among the three, then the en tire Senate 
will decide the opinions of the local 
government body. 

The steering committee represen- 
tative will be appointed by the student 
body president, screened by the Student 
Senate Internal Affairs Committee and 
confirmed by the Student Senate. 

The responsibilities of the steering 
committee will be to coordinate the 
lobby activities of the participating 
schools, to distribute information 
concerning the Student Agenda among 



all participants and to take other ac- 
tions as deemed necessary by the 
Steering Committee. 

A constitutional amendment was also 
considered at the Feb. 18 meeting of 
the Senate. 

The amendment, which would change 
the Senate meetings from weekly to bi- 
weekly, was propsoed' by Ellen 
Engleman. Engleman said she feels 
there is not enough business for the 
Senate to handle every week. Weeks 
when the Senate does not meet could be 
used by senators to complete com- 
mittee work, shesaid. 

The bill must lay over one more week 
before a vote can be taken on it. 

The first two Senate meetings of 1981 
were cancelled because of absenteeism 
from the weekly meetings. 

In other Students' Government 
business, Student Body President 
Momper made several committee 
assignments. 

Tom Harris will take over as the 
Legislative Affairs Committee 
chairperson because of the resignation 
from the Senate of its former chair- 
person, Gedalyahu Ben-Shimeon, last 
week. 

Momper appointed Chris Schneider. 
Jim Henry, Greg Leatherman, Wendy 
Gratz and Kyle Marqwardy to serve on 
the election board to hold the annual 
elections for the Senate and SUBOG in 
April. 

Two alternates to the board are yet 
to be named. 

Mark Bland and Engleman were 
appointed to the Internal Affairs 
Committee.

Is it murder or individual freedom? 
Baby killing or the right to make 
decisions affecting one's own body? 
These and many other complex 
questions afe'heing discussed by men 
and women alike when debating the 
controversial subject of abortion. 

Some feminists, like Cathryn 
Adamsky, professor of psychology and 
women's studies at IPFW, feel that 
whether you're for or against abortion 
is not the issue. "The issue is control 
over women's reproductive lives," she 
said, and "control over women's 
freedoms'' more than whether or not 
to terminate a pregnancy. She thinks 
women should be able to make their 
own choices whether or not to have an 
abortion. "If a woman gets pregnant 
when she doesn't want to, it's a forced 
choice," shesaid. 

On the other hand, there are just as 
many sincerely motivated people, like 
Mary Lou Renier, coordinator of 
Birthline, who disagree, calling 
abortion murder. Birthline, a local 
Catholic Charities agency, is involved, 
among other things, in natural family 
planning, pregnancy counseling and 
offering expectant mothers alter- 
natives to abortion. 

Renier said that "each girl they t,ee 
is in charge of her own destiny," and 
Birthline wants to help those girls who 
may be seeking guidance with their 
pregnancy to face the upcoming 
responsibilities of caring for a child. If 
the child is to be given up for adoption, 
their agency will help in locating a 
home for it. 

She thinks that the question of 
abortion depends on when you believea 
human life begins. Renier and other 
pro-life advocates say life begins at 
conception and that "any taking of that 
life after it has been conceived is really 
murder." 

In 1973, the Supreme Court ruled, in 
Roe vs. Wade, that abortion was legal 
in the U.S. In a scven-to-two decision, 



the court struck down aii restrictive 
laws against abortion until the time of 
viability (when the baby can live 
outside of the womb) . 

As a result of this ruling, many 
i portion clinics emerged throughout 
the country, similar to the one 
currently being operated by the 
Women's Health Organization (WHO) 
on Webster Street. Dee Duemling, 
director, feels her clinic was 
established to provide "safe, legal 
abortions at reduced rates," thereby 
not discriminating against the poor- 
There had been a great deal of concern 
for the countless back alley abortionists 
in existence prior to the 1973 ruling 
which resulted in many deaths and 
infections occuring in women due to 
unsanitary conditions and incompetent 
surgery. 

The WHO opened in June of 1978 
amidst local hostility, picketing and 
opposition from pro-life advocates in 
the community. After having overcome 
'zoning regulations, fire marshal! 
restrictions and building renovations, 
they secured a licensed physician to 
perform the abortions. He resigned 
after two months, due in part, said 
Duemling, to local harassment and 
pressure. 

Currently the doctor employed by the 
WHO has received no major hassles 
because, according to Duemling, of his 
long standing practice in town and 
reputation in the community. 

The clinic performs abortions up until 
the first trimester (12 weeks) of 
pregnancy, but because of their 
medical classification as a clinic and 
their limited facilities, they must refer 
women in later stages of pregnancy to 
other institutions, usually Detroit, 
Michigan. 

Duemling said the WHO sees three to 
four times more women for pregnancy 
tests, counseling, birth control in- 
formation and pap and pelvic

clinic is suction aspiration with a local 
anesthesia administered. The patient 
can usually be in and out of the clinic in 
three to four hours, said Duemling. A 
post-op exam after three weeks is 
performed along with counseling to 
determine both the physical and 
emotional condition of the woman. 

A "human life amendment" was 
proposed in Congress two years ago 
that, if passed, would drastically 
change the legal status of abortion, and, 
in turn, make abortion clinics illegal. 

This amendment, initially introduced 
by Sen. Jesse Helms ( R-N.C. ) and Rep. 
Robert K. Dornan (R-Calif.), and later 
by Rep. Henry Hyde IR-I11. ), proposes 
to protect human life at all stages and is 
therefore advocated by anti- 
abortionists. It states that "The 
paramount right to life is vested in each 
human being from the moment of 
fertilization without regard to age, ' 
health or condition of dependency." 

The Indiana legislature has been 
consistently supportive of the pro-life 
position. According to published 
reports, Indiana was the first state to 
call for a constitutional convention to 
introduce the Human Life Amendment 
(HLA). Eight of the 11 Indiana 
Congressmen continue to vote with the 



anti-abortionists and support HLA. 

Pro-choice advocates recently suf- 
fered a setback when Birch Bayh, noted 
for his support of their position, lost his 
bid for reelection to the Senate. His 
successor, Dan Quayle, has sym- 
pathized with pro-lifers but has 
recently withheld his support of the 
HLA. 

The Allen County Chapter of Right to 
Life, organized in 1974, is dedicated to 
informing the public on all life issues. 
Its president, Frank Avila, is concerned 
with the violence and killings being 
inflicted upon the innocent fetus and 
hopes the laws governing the defenses 
of these unborn will be changed. 

At a recent Indiana Right to Life 
meeting held in Indianapolis, Avila, 
representing Allen County, endorsed 
the "paramount" HLA. However, the 
National Right to Life is withholding 
public support of that particular 
amendment until alt other possibilities 
have been examined. There are other 
human life amendments being 
discussed, all varying somewhat from 
the HLA. Some include the allowance of 
abortion in the case of the mother's life 
being in danger, or a pregnancy as a 
result of rape or incest,

Evaluations top discussions 



HyKIMKUZEFF 
Managing Editor 

The student evaluation of teaching 
was a major concern of the Joint 
Faculty Senate as it discussed 
recommendations on the "Report of the 
Task Force on Faculty Assessment, 
Part One: "Teaching" at a Feb. 19 
meeting. 

The recommendations were made 
after the Faculty Affairs Committees, 
meeting jointly, considered the report 
during meetings in 1979-80. 

Though the Faculty Affairs Com- 
mittees did support, in principle, the 
report, they felt that it placed loo much 
emphasis on student evaluations. 

The committees recommended that 
an ad hoc committee consisting of two 
members from each university be 



selected by (he Senates and charged 
with suggesting to the joint Senate 
instruments and procedures for 
evaluation of Instruction that are 
consistent with the guidelines the 
committees set forth. 

It was decided through a vote that the 
ad hoc committee would be given one 
year to give their suggestions for 
procedures for faculty assessment. 

When it was moved that the uniform 
procedures and instruments for 
.issusstiit; leaching be mandatory, 
instead of optional as slated in the 
guidelines by the Faculty Affairs 
Commit lees, Lloyd Smith, associate 
professor of Civil Engineering 
Technology, disagreed. 

"Students are here to learn," said 
Smith. "They arc not competent to 



judge faculty. The evaluations may or 
may not have anything to do with 
whether the teacher is teaching," he 
said. "The student may not be aware 
that he has not learned anything for 
five, six, seven, or eight years after 
taking a class." 

Smith said that his two reasons for 
feeling that students are not competent 
to judge faculty are that "students 
don't understand the language of the 
questions on the evaluations," and that 
"the mode of evaluation of faculty is 
fear, the student's fear of being graded 
down by the professor being 
evaluated." 

"I will function whether I am 
evaluated or not," Smith dald, "and if 
there is mandatory evaluation, it will 
be with 100 percent participation minus 



one." None of the other faculty 
members present at the meeting 
commented on Smith's statements on 
student evaluations. 

Concerning IPFW's budget, the 
presiding officer of the Joint Faculty 
Senate meeting, Chancellor Joseph 
P. Giusti, said that "increased faculty 
and staff compensation is the number 
one priority "He said that the only way 
to supplement the budget is through 
tuition and reallocations, and for every 
percent increase in salary, it will cost 
the university S115.000. Nothing will be 
known for sure about the new budget 
until mid-May, said Giusti. 

The fate of the IPFW budget now 
rests with the Indiana General 
Assembly, currently in session in 
Indianapolis.

Senate stirs 
history thoughts 



Taxation without representation \ 
major issue in the 1770s, and it helped to 
bring about the American Revolutionary 
War and subsequent American 
Independence. 

The situation now existing in the IPFW 
Student Senate can be compared to that 
era of history. 

The taxation is in the form of the ac- 
tivity fees paid by all full-time IPFW 
students. 

The lack of proper representation 
comes from the fact that only four of the 
members of the current Senate were 
among the 18 elected by the student body 
last April ; the remainder of the Sena te is 
made up of senators voted in by other 
senators by a process known as 
petitioning. 

When one to five senators resign, any 
student who is interested can petition the 
Senate for one of the vacant seats. 

This is done by gathering the 
signatures of 30 students on a petition 
and presenting it to the seated senators 
who vote on acceptance of the 
petitioning senate aspirant. 

Often, the petitioning senator-to-be is a 
friend of a current senator. 

While there would seem to be nothing 
wrong with that fact, it should be noted 
that since there are 18 senators and 14 
SUBOG members making up Students' 
Government, a petitioner would not have 
to go outside that body to fulfill the 
petition's 30-signature requirement. 

When six or more vacancies exist in 
the Senate at one time, the constitution 



of Students' Government requires that 
the student body president call for a 
special election to replace the resigned 
senators. 

In recent weeks, the Senate has had 
more than six vacancies at one time. 

But, no special election has been 
called. 

In all probability, no revolution will 
occur. 

In fact, few people will notice or even 
care. 

But notice and care they should! 
Members of the Student Senate, elected 
or not, decide to what activities and in 
what amounts the activity fees collected 
from full-time students are distributed. 

We're not proposing that "taxation 
raids" be made on the Student Senate or 
that anything like the Boston Tea Party 
be planned to show student displeasure. 

We are suggesting that the student 
body has the right to be represented in 
its government by members that are 
voted in — not petitioned into — office. 

We're suggesting that the Senate 
follow its constitution. 

We're also suggesting to members of 
the Senate that they "get their act 
together." It's time for them to stop 
"playing games" and start working. 

It's time for the members of Students' 
Government to become responsible for 
getting done the work of the Senate, 
instead of relying on their leaders — Ann 
Momper, Steve Westrick and Kathy 
Ertel — to do it all.

At the risk of appearing

the use of convicted felons 
for scientific research. 
Absurd? Not when one

chimpanzee with human 
sperm in order to create a 
creature which can be used 
to serve the needs of 
mankind Iminers, handlers 
of radioactive materials, 
sheep herders, and as a 
source of replacement

name a few examples) . 

I am not implying that any 
of the above should be done, 
only that these are very real 
possibilities and fact, 
respectively. One can 
confirm the activities in 
China by reading the front 
page of the 2-12-81 issue of 
the Ft. Wayne News- 
Sentinel. 

Consider, what 1 see as 
eclectic, the criminals for 
research idea. Criminals 
would be faced with a choice 
which could very well in- 
fluence them not to commit a 
serious crime. 

How many men would 
rape a woman if he knew he 
would become an ex- 
perimental subject upon 
conviction? This idea would 
rid our criminal institutions 
of great numbers of 
parasites currently willing to 
trade freedom of mobility for 
a life of tax supported food.

Saint Francis and IU (of 
IPFW) also offer degree 
programs but they require 
four years for completion 
instead of two and they must 
be finished at another 
campus. 

The St, Francis program 
requires two years of school 
to be completed at its 
campus before transferring 
to Bali State University for 
the last two years. 

IU nursing students may 
begin their first year of study 
at IPFW by taking all their 
non-nursing courses and 



then transferring to 
Indianapolis for their nurs- 
ing courses. 

If a nursing student at 
IPFW wishes a four year 
degree from Purdue, he or 
she must graduate from the 
two year program, pass the 
tests (called boards) 
required for certification as 
a registered nurse, and work 
as a nurse for a year. Then 
they may come back for a 
two year add-on program 
leading to a bachelor degree 
in nursing. There were 79 
nurse (one male) enrolled 
in this program, Cowen said, 
as of October 1980. 

Students wishing to 
transfer from another 
nursing program may 
challenge the first two 
required nursing courses. If 
they pass testing, they may 
begin their second year of 
nursing. Whether they will 
graduate in a year or not 
depends upon how many of 
the non-nursing courses they 
have completed. 

A student wishing to 
challenge must have had at 
least one year of formal 
nursing education. 

A registered nurse (RN) 
should not be confused with a 



licensed practical nurse 
&lt;LPN) or nurse's aide (NA). 
They are all nursing 
positions, but they differ in 
level of education and duties. 

An RN usually needs two 
or more years of college, and 
requirements for an LPN 
can be completed in one year 
through the Fort Wayne 
Community School system. 
They both require testing 
before becoming registered 
or licensed nurses. 

An NA may be able to find 
on the job training but for- 
mal schooling or experience 
is usually required. They do 
not need to take a test. 

The five boards a nursing 
student must face test dif- 
ferent areas of learning over 
a two day period. These 
boards are given twice a 
year in February and July. 
As of July 1982 the boards 
will have a new format. 
Cowen said that students will 
be tested on all five learning 
areas in one board. 

Cowen's records indicate 
that 87 percent of the 
students tested at IPFW 
passed the boards. The mean 
score was over 505 in all 
boards. A passing score is 
350.

I Abortion 

I (Continued from page 1) 
J Pat Deihl, president of the 
f National Organization of 
I Women iNOW) in Fort 
{ Wayne, feels the HLA and 
£ other amendments of this 
r type restrict a woman's 
f choice whether or not to go 
f through with a pregnancy 
r and forces her into being a 
t "baby factory." 
r She called such an 
[ amendment an intrusion of 
; the individual rights of a 
£ woman. She feels that forc- 
£ ing a woman to carry and 
t deliver an unwanted baby is 
E "subhuman" and often 
k devastating for both the 
J, mother and father. The 
£ choice of abortion is a per- 
» sonal decision, Deihl thinks, 
f and "the mother ought to be 
F the, prime, if not the only, 
J decisionmaker." 

NOW members want to 

spread the word to both men 

and women, said Deihl, that 

. the HLA will ban the IUD 

and certain forms of the 

l birth control pill, because 

they can prevent the im- 

. plantation of the fertilized 

1 eggintheulerus. 

If more women were in 
charge of the decision 
making processes con- 
' cerning abortion, Deihl feels 
the effectiveness rate of 
contraceptives would in- 
crease, doctors would be 
• more sympathetic towards 
the needs and self worth of 
the patients and legislative 
action (like the HLA) would 
not be passed. She thinks it is 
no accident that most of the 
legislators, researchers and 
doctors are men. Quoting 
feminist Flo Kennedy, she 
said, "If men could get

"See Mexico, Brazil, Peru 
and Chili — all in one day." 
"Enjoy the glamorous 
nightlife of Reno and 
Manhattan, or visit exotic 
Cairo, Morocco or 
Shanghai." Do these sound 
like travel agency gimmics? 
Well, even the traveler of 
modest means can explore 
all these places — without 
leaving the state of 
Indiana. 

Lying within the perimeter 
of this state are over 2,200 
cities, towns and villages 
that Hoosiers have proudly 
named after famous and 
infamous persons, places or 
things. 

Byron, Milton and Ten- 
nyson are represented in 
Indiana, as well as Buddha, 
Montezuma and Santa Claus. 
One can go to Rome, visit 
Cicero, confront Hamlet and 
be haunted by Banquo On a 
single weekend an energetic 
traveler can journey to 
Delphi, be a guest of Plato, 
climb Mt. Olympus, wander 
through Arcadia and end up 
at Omega. Or for something 
really out of this world, 
space out on a trip toSaturn. 

Indiana towns and villages 
are rich in history, but they 



can be confusing. Many 
questions plague the weary 
traveler: Is it 9 miles to 
Twelve Mile or 12 miles to 
Nine Mile? Where is the 
action in Disko? How much 
is beer in Bourbon and Rye? 
What time is dusk in 
Daylight and Rising Sun? 
Did the first residents of 
Eden live in Leisure? Is it 
advisable to ask directions in 
Napoleon for Waterloo or 
Areola? Tourists beware! A 
wrong turn out of Jordan on 
a pilgrimage east toward 
Mecca and you may find 
yourself anywhere from 
Alamo to Zulu. 

The positive attitude of the 
early Indiana settlers is 
reflected in names like 
Progress, Alert, Advance, 
Onward and Enterprise, as 
well as love of country in 
Patriot, Liberty, Indepen- 
denceand Freedom. 



Many names come 
from colorful legends of local 
folks like Old Otto. Antivllle 
and Young America. One 
could spend a fascinating 
summer learning how Gnaw 
Bone, Hymera, Buckskin, 
Kewanna, Sardinia and 
Yankeetown got their 
names. Some are based on 
anecdotes while others are 
contractions of Indian 
names. Products produced 
in the are get top billing in 
Asphaltum, Cementville, 
Gas City, Mineral City, 
Petroleum, Sulphur, Carbon 
and Coal Bluff. 

For the traveler who likes 
to relax, Indiana provides a 
wide variety of pleasures. 
One can seek the easy life at 
Mt. Comfort, Mt. Healthy or 
three different locations of 
Mt. Pleasant, and have a 
choice of resting in a Red 
Cloud bed or a White Cloud 



bed. 

So, this summer, when the 
urge to tour strikes, make 
note of a few simple tips. Set 
out on the Correct route, 
slow down in Speed, pass 
quietly though Solitude, Tall 
in love in Valentine, but not 
with someone from Fickle. 
Seek Harmony and Hope, but 
sleer clear of Cyclone and 
Hurricane Creek. 

Try to locale Riddle, count 
sheep in Lamb or you may 
well wake up in the village of 
Surprise. And if you get lost, 
follow the nearest creek — 
Grass Creek, Cornstalk 
Creek, Poison Creek, Muddy 
Fork Silver Creek, or Jack's 
Defeat Creek. If this fails, 
just take Lost Creek until 
you get to Zipp. By then, if 
you don't arrive at Home 
Place, Cumback because 
you Needmore Ade. Only 
then will you reach Eureka.

pregnant, abortion would be 
asacrament " 

Disagreeing with the 
argument is another local 
agency, Concerned Nurses 
for Life, which supports the 
HLA and other pro-life 
movements. They think the 
HLA, if passed, will protect 
all life from the moment of 
conception until natural 
death. This volunteer 
agency, composed of nurses 
of all degrees, along with 
non-medical personnel, 
offers educational programs 
to community schools, 
churches, clubs and neigh- 
borhood groups. Their office 
on Broadway serves as a 
resource area for pro-life 
information. 

Their function, according 
to president Anne Koehl, is to 
help foster careful con- 
sideration of the alternatives 
to abortion. While the 
Concerned Nurses do not 
dispense or advocate ar- 
tificial contraceptives or 
abortion, they do inform 
women on the various forms 
and methods used. 

They also provide free 
pregnancy tests, natural 
family planning procedures 
and recently have installed a 
24 hour answering service. 
Helpline, to take calls and 
give referrals to those who 
need help before and after 
normal business hours. 

Koehl believes the key to 
the organization's ef- 
fectiveness is to get the girls 
through that "initial stage of 
panic." Once they think 
through the problem, she 
feels they will want to 
complete the pregnancy, 
because it is "not natural for 
them lo want to abort their 
own baby." 

Pro-choice advocates 
believe that every woman 
has the right lo a safe and 
legal abortion, once she has 
exhausted all other 
possibilities. They feel they 
must safeguard a woman's 
right to plan her own life, to 



make her own medical 
decisions and to choose an 
abortion when and if she 
believes it is necessary. 

Those who advocate a pro- 
life position think that all life 
is precious and equally 
deserving of protection 
under the law To them, life 
begins at the moment of 
conception and any violation 
of that life constitutes 
nothing short of murder. 

Unless the Supreme Court 
overturns its 1973 ruling, or a 
human life amendment can 
be entered into the U.S. 
Constitution, legal abortion 
will continue to exist in this 



intry. 



Students are wasting less 
food, says the director of 
Food Services at the U. of 
Kentucky. The number of 
meals students skip has 
decreased from 28 percent 
10 years ago to about 20 
percent today, he says. The 
biggest waste items remain 
baked desserts and ice 
cream.

Mangione concert uneven 



Chuck strikes out

at the Embassy Theater last Wednesday. (Photo by 
Holden Maecker.) 



ByMIKEGEFFEN 
Chlcr Reporter 

Chuck Mangione's concert 
at the Embassy last Wed- 
nesday was, for the most 
part, disappointing. The sell 
out crowd was enthusiastic 
as Mangione performed a 
number of familiar tunes, 
but something was wrong. 

This was Chuck's third 
concert in Fort Wayne, and 
this concert had none of the 
dynamic, uptempo ex- 
citement the others had. 
Maybe he was worried about 
the Grammies, or maybe he 
was at the end of a long tour. 
Whatever the reason, it was 
obvious in the missed notes 
in the opening number, "Hot 
Consuelo," that he was 
having an off night. "Con- 
suelo" wasn't so hot, and 
neither were most of the 
tunes in the first set. 

The first half was 
mediocre except for 
"Bellavia" and "Chase the 
Clouds Away," two songs 



that stand out in any concert 
he does. 

The group, consisting of 
Chris Vadella on woodwinds, 
Charles Meeks on bass, 
James Bradley on drums 
and Grant Geissman on 
guitar, were lackluster and 
broke into routine solos 
during each number, 
making this part of the 
concert an exercise in 
repetition. The worst culprit 
was Geissman who per- 
formed the same guitar solo 
without any seeming 
variation, grinding our ear 
drums into oblivion in the 
process. 

The sole redeeming factor 
of the evening was the 
second set. This set had the 
life and vibrancy you expect 
from Mangione Evidently 
something happened to the 
group in their dressing 
rooms to shake them from 
lethargy. The high point of 
the set was "Children of 



Sanchez," which featured a 
fine vocal by Charles Meeks 
and blistering solos by 
Vadalla and Mangione. Even 
Geissman was good, putting 
more variation in his guitar 
solo. 

From this number, the 
group went on to equally 
good renditions of "Give It 
All Ya Got" and "Feels So 
Good. " The group was in fine 
form as they finished the 
concert with their encore, 
"Main Squeeze," and the 
evening ended on a pleasing 

Even so, considering the 
sloppiness of the first half, 
and the concert's potential, 
the evening was disap- 
pointing, overall. There are 
just so many times you can 
hear the same tunes without 
any changes Eventually, 
any performer Is liable to 
strike out, and in his third 
concert in Fort Wayne, 
Chuck Mangione did. 




Oscar overlooks 'Melvin and Howard' 



By MIKE GEFFEN 
Chief Reporter 

True to form, the Academy 
has virtually overlooked one 
of the best, most refreshing 
films of the year, "Melvin 
and Howard." The film has 
received three Oscar 
nominations, but it deserves 
many more. 

"Melvin" is a charming, 
subtle, uniquely American 
film about the ideal of 
success, not the Horatio 
Alger myth of success, like 
some American films in the 
past, but about the goal of 
winning it. 

The protagonist, Melvin 
Dummar (Paul LeMat), is 
exactly the type of character 
who forms the backbone of 
the country. He shifts from 
job to job, trying to support 



his wife and kids, dreaming 
about success while the bill 
collectors repossess his car. 

On the way home one 
night, Dummar gives a lift 
to an old man who says he is 
Howard Hughes (.Jason 
Robardsi Because of this 
act of kindness, and the 
rapport they develop. 
Hughes leaves his money to 
Dummar 

The director, Jonathan 
Demme. colors his film with 
wry, wistful comments on 
success, and tiny details on 
the ironies of life. These 
details and Demme's style 
are what makes the film 
special. 

The tone of "Melvin" is 
somewhat similar to the 
films made in the late forties 
by Frank Capra and writer- 



director Preston Sturges. 
Unlike Sturges, Demme isn't 
hard-edged and looks at his 
characters with affection. 

The performances from 
the cast are wonderful. Paul 
LeMat plays upon the small 
town average American 
characterizations he gave in 
the "American Graffiti" 
films and Demme's "Handle 
With Care," giving the role a 
subtly comic twist, LeMat' s 
skillful acting makes 
Dummar seem ordinary yet 
special. 

Mary Steenburgen, as 
Linda, Dummar's first wife, 
proves herself a deft com- 
medienne. With a voice 
reminiscent of Jean 
Arthur's, and an unusual 
combination of gamine and 
earthy qualities, she brings

to the role the sharp un- 
derlying wit and touching 
sensibility it needs 

Jason Robards is moving. 
He plays Hughes with subtle 
undertones of world- 
weariness and sadness. The 
moment where Hughes 
starts to sing "Bye-Bye 
Blackbird" with tears in his 
eyes shows Robards' craft as 
an actor and is perhaps one 
of the most affecting 
moments ever put on film. 
Robards' deservedly won 
one of the film's three Oscar 
nominations for his per- 
formance, as did Steen- 
burgen. 

Bo Goldman's screenplay 
also won a nomination and, 
hopefully, it will win. 
Goldman's script is full of 
comic observations on status 
and success Perhaps his 
funniest comment on this 



subject is his hilarious send- 
up of game shows called 
"Easy Street," where 
Melvin and Linda go to try to 
win some money. Goldman 
combines this satire with a 
great deal of humanity 
which gives the film its fresh 
appeal. 

"Melvin and Howard" is 
not as flashy nor as 
pretentious as "Raging 
Bull" and it did not get as 
many nominations. 
However, it deserves to be 
nominated for best picture, 
right alongside of "Bull." 
"Melvin" arrived in Fort 
Wayne with little fanfare, 
and sadly, by the time you 
read this, is about to leave 
the same way. That is a 
shame because it is a rich, 
funny, wry, unabashedly 
American film that deserves 
to be seen.

Play fills house 



By NANCY SLICK 
Staff Writer 

It is a joy lo sit down in 
front of a stage and see a 
play that is done well. 
There are many fine 
theatres in Fort Wayne 
that do nice work, and the 
Civic Theatre, with its 
newest production, "Man 
of La Mancha," is one of 
them. 

The show recently 
opened lo a packed house 
of enthusiastic viewers 
who loved (to the point of 
a standing ovation) what 
they saw. What they saw 
was the story of Don 
Quixote, Knight Errant of 
La Mancha, as told in a 
musical play written by 
Dale Wasserman (music 
by Mitch Leigh, lyrics by 
Joe Darion), and adapted 
from the writings of Don 
Muguel de Cervantes 
(1547-1616). 

Poor Don Quixote 
(James Clauser) is a 
gentleman amid 

roughnecks. His mind 
dwells on chivalry and 
honor, and he comes to 
believe himself a knight 
at a time when there have 
been no knights for 300 

In his journeys to 
conquer windmill mon- 
sters and perform his 
other knightly deeds, heis 



accompanied by his 
constant companion, 
Sancho Panza (Larry 
True). 

His chivalrous heart is 
dedicated to his dear 
lady, Aldonza (Janet 
Gabet), whom he has 
renamed Dulcinea. 
Aldonza is the keeper of 
men's company and the 
slovenly kitchen maid at 
the local inn, but Don 
Quixote sees in her only 
beauty and purity. 

James Clauser, as Don 
Quixote, is outstanding. 
He is endearing and 
likable in his portrayal 
and sings with a deep and 
resonant voice. His 
rendition of "Dulcinea" is 
sweet and heartfelt, and 
he sings wonderfully the 
uplifting and indomitable 
' 'Impossible Dream . ' ' 

Larry True, as Sancho 
Panza, is charming and 
lovable. His clever 
portrayal is delightful 
and very funny as he 
bounds around the stage 
in humble servitude to his 
Lord Knight Errant. His 
song, "I Really Like 
Him" is marvelous. 

Janet Gabet plays an 
excellent Aldonza, who 
leads a life befitting the 
unfortunate class of her 
birth. Her presence is 
bold and her voice throaty 



and powerful as she 
strives for some sense of 
life as it could be. 
Another mentionable 

portrayal is the well- 
developed character of 
the Innkeeper, as played 
by Steve Black. 

Robert Sandmaier 
designed the wholly 
imaginative set that 
utilizes height on the 
stage and the depth of the 
orchestra pit. (The or- 
chestra plays at the back 
of the stage behind a drop 
curtain). 

Richard Casey put the 
show together with ac- 
complished direction, and 
Mary Kay Perkins staged 
the musical numbers. 

"Man of La Mancha," 
although very funny in 
parts, is very touching 
and moving as Don 
Quixote struggles for 
happiness in an unhappy 
place. His society sees 
him as a madman, but his 
short fantasy is more 
valuable to him than a 
lifetime lacking the good 
things he seeks. He is not 
"poor Don Quixote;" he 
has found his own 
fulfillment, and as the 
padre says of him: 
"There goes either the 
wisest madman or the 
maddest 
world."

Stan Writer 

Bare bones rock 'n' roll 
seems to be the trademark of 
Fort Wayne's rock bars. The 
Roxy, on the corner of Main 
and Harrison, is a good 
example of this attitude. 

Bare bones means two 
things: inordinately high 
prices and lousy atmosphere 
(i.e. tacky interior design). 

Not many people would 
consider a S2 cover charge 
and $4.50 for a pitcher of 
beer to be a whopping good 
deal. A liberal opinion would 
allow that a pitcher of beer 
should never, under any 
circumstance, cost more 



FBC rocks Roxy 



than $3.50. 

The Roxy is a new name 
for the Cat's Meow, which 
has been around for the 
better part of fifteen years. 
The name change came 
about in an effort to give the 
place, which was thought of 
as a strip joint, a better 
reputation. Unfortunately, it 
seems as though the only 
thing changed is the name, 
and that changed overnight. 

Every cloud has a silver 
lining, though. The FBC 
band, currentlyappearingat 
the Roxy, is without a doubt 
one of the hottest bands to 
come out of the Fort Wayne

FBC has very few rivals in

In brief... 

Little summer financial aid to be available 



Very little financial aid 
will be available to 
summer IPFW students 
according to Joan Eaton, 
director of scholarships 
and financial aid. 

Because nearly all of 
IPFW's discretionary 
money was used to make 
awards during the fall 
and spring semesters, 
none is left for summer 
awarding, Eaton said. 

She said that there 
would be no summer 
employment under the 
College Work Study 
(CWS&gt; program because 
IPFW's allocation for 
1980-81 will be earned by 
students holding 
academic year jobs. 
Other programs not 
funded for summer in- 
clude National Direct 
Student Loan (NDSL), 
Supplemental Edu- 
cational Opportunity 
Grant (SEOG), and the 
various IPFW scholar- 



ship and grant programs- 
There are a number of 
entitlement and privately 
funded programs thatwill 
be available to eligible 
students, Mrs. Eaton 
said. These include: 

— Basic Educational 
Opportunity Grant 
(BEOG). Students who 
are eligible for a 1980-81 
BEOG and who have not 
used their total en- 
titlement during the 
academic year may 
receive additional money 
if they register for at least 
six credit hours. Students 
who enrolled full time 
both fall and spring are 
not eligible for any more 
money for summer at- 
tendance. 

— Guaranteed Student 
Loan. Students who 
register for at least six 
credit hours may apply 
for a GSL from their own 
bank or lending in- 
stitution. A special ap- 



pliction is required tor 
this program. 

— Child of a Disabled 
Veteran Grant Eligible 
students may use their 
grant for the summer 
terms. Summer usage 
counts as one-half 
semester toward a 
maximum of eight 
allowed semesters. 

Students wishing to 
take advantage of these 
programs should contact 
the Financial Aid Office, 
Kettler 109, before 
registering for summer 
classes. Mrs. Eaton said 
that a GSL application 
could lake up to eight 
weeks to process through 
all its steps, so students 
should apply early 
enough to meet the fee 
payment deadline of May 
15. 

More information about 
summer aid can be ob- 
tained at the Financial 
Aid office. 



Police begin second traffic control period 



By SANDRA WILEY 
Editor-in-chief 

The IPFW police have 
begun a second traffic 
control period for cars 
leaving and entering the 
campus' main entrance. 

Beginning last week, 
the campus police now 
direct traffic at the 
Coliseum Blvd.-West 
Drive intersection during 
the noontime rush in 
addition to the already 
begun control of traffic at 
that intersection between 
4:30 and 5:30 p.m. 



part of the campus 
police's continued em- 
phasis on service, said 
John R. Carnaghi, vice 
chancellor for financial 
affairs, in an interview 
last week. 



Students and visitors to 
IPFW can now find out 
what's happening on 
campus each day via the 
TV monitor on the first 
floor of KetUer Hall. 

Through the joint ef- 
forts of University 
Relations and the 
Learning Resource 
Center &lt;LRC) a list of 
each day's events will be 
shown on the monitor, 
said Jerry Medley, 
director of University 
Relations. 



Crawford 

(Continued from page 1 &gt; 
According to Crawford, 

nursing roles are changing. 
"Nurses are treated dif- 
ferently than doctors. 
Raising the education level 
of nurses will help us attain 
more status," said 
Crawford. He feels it is 
necessary for nurses to 
continue taking medical 
courses to keep them current 
on new medical information. 
Nurses are now becoming 
more assertive and working 
independent of the doctor.

Classified ads are not the 
only way for students to find 
jobs. 

During its first year, the 
Job Location Service here 
has filled over 400 jobs, 
taking an average of two 
weeks in placing each 
student. 

This free service to 
students is in Room 113 of the 
Walb Memorial Union and 
handles a variety of job 
placements — from general 
labor, sales, and restaurant 
and food services, to retail 
positions and office work. 

But of most importance to 
job-seeking students is that 
these jobs are geared to the 
needs and lifestyles of 

Student Government is 
dead again at the U. of 
Texas-Auslin after students 
voted by a two-to-one margin 
to reject a new constitution. 
That document, which 
established a new student 
government, was approved 
by a three-vote margin in an 
October referendum. The 
student election commission 
ruled, however, that 
procedural problems 
prevented some students 
from voting and scheduled a 
supplemental election. 
Opponents of bringing back 
campus wide government, 
abolished in 1978, took ad- 
vantage of the second 
chance, forcing those who 
want student government 
back to the drawing board.

vital part of the hospital, would continue going to said. 



Carnaghi said the 
emphasis on service does 
not mean the university is 
disarming the campus 
police, but that the 
university is just em- 
phasizing service more. 

"The police still have 
the rights, authority and 
function to carry out their 
(police, responsibilities," 
Carnaghi said. But he 
added that the "emphasis 
is not on the 'cops and 
robbers' aspect" of law 
enforcement here. 

To aid in expanding the 
service of the campus 
police, Carnaghi said, the 
university is now seeking 
an additional officer to 
hire. He noted that the 
six-officer force is now at 
the same number it was 
in 1970 when 6,000 
students attended IPFW. 

Carnaghi said that with 



the addition of weekend 
college and more evening 
classes, along with the 
addition of more parking 
lots and a current 
enrollment of more than 
10,000 students, another 
officer is needed. 

The new officer will be 
working the second shift 

— evenings and weedends 

— Carnaghi said. 

He said that the 
university is trying to 
make the campus police 
more visable on campus. 
One way of doing this is to 
erect more signs direc- 
ting visitors and students 
to the Police and Safely 
building on the west saide 
of the campus, hesaid. 

A plan to upgrade the 
emergency first aid kits 
and first aid skills of each 
officer is also underway, 
Carnaghi said. 



New TV monitor lists daily IPFW events 



The list is changed 
daily, and a list is 
screened on Friday for 
the weekend, Medley 
said. He noted that the 
new service is using 
equipment already owned 
by the university, so no 
added costs are involved 
in the project. 

A similar TV monitor 
will be installed in the 
Walb Memorial Union 
soon. 

Medley said that a list 
of each day's events is 



sent to the LRC by 
University Relations. 
LRC then puts the list on a 
closed-circuit"- television 
and it is receiveoVby the 
monitoring unit in Ket- 
tler. 

The reaction to the 
monitors by students and 
visitors will be gauged, 
Medley said, after a few 
weeks, and a decision will 
be made as to the 
monitor's usefulness and 
need. 



BSA celebrates 

history month 

with displays 



By MAY S. EHRESMAN 

Stall Writer 

February is black history 

month and to commemorate 

blacks and some of the roles 
they have played in history, 
the Black Student Assembly 
(BSA) has assembled two 
displays in Kettler Hall. 

The BSA is also sponsoring 
a visit by Elenor Smith, a 
professor from the 
University of Cincinnati who 
will speak on Black Women 
in History on March 10. The 
exact time and place have 



not been set said Mike 
Edmonds, vice president of 
BSA. 

Although the speaking 
engagement is being 
promoted by BSA, the 
Women's Studies depart- 
ment is financing the visit. 

Among BSA activities 
aimed towards blacks are 
plans for a committee 
designed to help IPFW 
students locate jobs and find 
grants, Edmonds said. 
However, most of the events,

Shaaf resigns physical plant post 



Richard Schaaf has 

resigned his post as director 
of the Physical Plant to 
accept a similar position 
with the One Summit Square 
it was learned Tuesday. 

Schaafs resignation will 
be effective March 31. 

The director will assume 
his position as building 
manager for the 16-floor 



downtown office building on 
April 1. Schaaf was chosen 
from 157 candidates. 

John Carnaghi, vice 
chancellor for financial 
affairs, said of Schaafs 
resignation, "As much as I 
hale to see him leave the 
campus, this will be a 
tremendous opportunity for 
him." 



Carnaghi said the salary 
for the One Summit Square 
post is "attractive," and the 
job will allow Schaaf to 
remain at his current 
residency. "It's an op- 
portunity he (Schaaf) can't 
pass by, "he said. 

"I'm very pleased for 
him," said Carnaghi. "I wish 
him very well."

Men close 
to finish 



By TIMOTHY J. ROSS 
Sports Editor 

Most pilots fly in the sky, 
but Bethel's Pilots flew into 
the gymnasium last 
Saturday, Feb. 21, to down 
the Tuskers 83-74. 

According to head 
basketball coach Ken Work- 
man, the first half was a 
tight race. Even though the 
Tuskers lost, they showed a 
continued overall im- 
provement in their playing 
along with better intensity 
and more aggressiveness. 

IPFW experienced 
problems near the end of the 
first half. The Tuskers made 
a costly mistake that led to a 
seven point deficit, 40-33. 

"We let Bethel get their 
fast break going," said 
Workman. 

IPFW emerged from the 
locker room only to find 
Bethel's Pilots in an un- 



nerving full court zone press. 

The Tuskers could not hold 
up against the press Their 
passing and patience broke 
down and the Pilots soared 
to a substantial lead. 

B?FW tried in vain to 
regain their composure and 
lost the game. 

Rickie Smith led scoring 
for the Tuskers with 25 
points, and Brian Grady 
followed with 19 points. 

Earlier in the week the 
Tuskers met a strong Marion 
team and lost by 15 points, 
90-75. 

IPFW stands at 9-16 with 
only one game remaining in 
this season. Tonight the 
Tuskers go up against a 
tough St. Joseph team. 

"We are hoping to con- 
tinue our improved play at 
St. Joseph's Thursday as we 
finish our season," said 
Workman.

'81s displayed 
at coliseum 



BvMlKEHOLLEV 
Staff Writer 

Soft background music, 
door prizes, and a large 
selection of 1981 motorcycles 
set the scene in the lower 
arena of the Memorial 
Coliseum for the second 
annua) New Model Motor- 
cycle Preview Show. The 
two-day event, which is 
promoted by Don Ehlerding, 
featured bikes from Suzuki, 
Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki, 
Harley-Davidson. Indian, 
and Vespa. 

With the price of gasoline 
going higher at each fill-up, 
many people are turning 
their attention toward two- 
wheeled transportation. 



"The greatest amount of 
interest seems to be directed 
toward low cost motorcycles 
.for back and forth to work 
use, and large size road 
bikes for touring," said one 
dealer representative. 

In the large engine road 
bike class, fancy paint 
schemes and technically 
advanced engineering have 
brought about such wonders 
as the Yamaha Midnight 
Special, Custom Harley- 
Davidson Sportster, and 
several other rocket fast 
offerings from Suzuki, 
Honda, and Kawasaki. 
These companies also 
market a large line of 
smaller, 50cc to 750cc, bikes 



capable of giving hours of 
riding pleasure for whatever 
your riding style. 

Dual purpose cycles 
designed for both on and off 
road use have become very 
popular in the past decade. 
Each year these bikes see 
great improvements. 
Suspension, engine 
reliability, and material 
quality have advanced at a 
rate so fast that the 1981 
bikes make five to seven- 
year-old bikes look obsolete. 
For the rider who likes to 
ride both on and off road, 
there are many good quality 
bikes to choose from this 
year, although some, such as 
the new Honda 200 four 
stroke, are extremely 
limited in availability. 

The off-road racing scene 
was represented by the new 
line from Yamaha 50cc 
through 465cc, Kawasaki 
80cc through 250cc, Suzuki, 
and the sensational new 
water-cooled Honda 125R 
moto-cross. Water-cooled 
bikes were first proto-type 
tested in the mid seventies 



for off-road use and today 
several manufacturers offer 
water-cooled 125cc moto- 
cross bikes. 

Honda swept the show with 
their three and four-wheeled 
off-road sports vehicles. This 
could be a coming sport with 
many companies already 
producing limited lines of 
three wheelers. The Honda 
Odyssey is a four wheel 
miniature dune buggy, 
which is great for the person 
who wants to go off-road 
with more than two wheels. 

The show also included a 
few relic motorcycles 
restored to mint condition 
and a large number of 
mopeds. 

The second annual 
motorcycle show enabled 
people to see some of the 
bikes available. There were 
a very limited number of 
dealers represented, and for 
the off-road enthusiast there 
was little; but if you are 
looking for a road bike or 
just a way to spend a few 
hours, catch the third annual 
motorcycle show next year. 



Women win close one 



By MIKE FRANKE 
Chief Reporter 

With a three-game winning 
streak going for them, the 
IPFW Women's Basketball 
squad went into last night's 
game at Goshen with the 
hope of keeping a good thing 
going. The streak reached 
three games last Wednesday 
when Coach Peggy Voisin's 
team defeated Grace 53-51. 

IPFW and Grace traded 
baskets almost evenly in the 
first half as Grace walked off 
leading 22-21 at the in- 
termission. The second half 
provided the same kind of 
play as the Tuskers could 
.accumulate only small 
leads. 

With a little more than a 
minute to go in the game the 
Tuskers led by six points, but 
some careless play allowed 
Grace to come to within two 
points, with eight seconds 
showing on the clock. 

Grace tried a desperation 



shot with two seconds left, 
but the shot spun off the rim 
and IPFW prevailed 53-51. 
Kathleen Smith was the 
leading scorer for the 
Tuskers as she hit for 14 
points. Ann Klopfenstein and 
Sue Hendricks each chipped 
in with 10 points. 

Last night's regular 
season finale at Goshen 
could be a sign of what's to 
come in this weekend's 
Northern District Tour- 
nament being hosted by 
IPFW. There is a good 
chance that the two teams 
will square off in Friday 
night's opening round gome. 

There will be seven teams 
in the tournament, all of 
whom will be seeded in 
numerical order. At this 
writing Saint Mary's was the 
number one seeded team, 
with Manchester in the 
second spot, and Purdue 
Calumet the third. IPFW 
will probably be the fourth 



seeded team. Goshen, 
Grace, and Tri-Slate will 
battle for the order of the 
final three spots, depending 
on game action from this 
week. 

Going into the tournament 
coach Peggy Voisin sees 
some definite signs of an 
improving basketball team. 
"We are beginning to show a 
team concept, which allows 
us to play on a more con- 
sistent basis," she said.

After losing its first 
seven matches and 14 of 15 
sets, the Tusker men's 
volleyball team won three of 
six matches last week, 
winning eight of 14 sets 
played, and finished third in 
the five- team state tour- 
nament. 

This would seem to make 
for a very happy coach. 
Wrong. 

"We're not where . I 
thought we should be at this 
point," Coach Arnie Ball 
said. "We really felt we were 
better than that," he said of 
IPFW's "disappointing 
third" in the state tour- 
nament at Earlham College 
at Richmond. 

A last-minute schedule 
change brought Fort Wayne 
Bible College to the Con- 
cordia Seminary gym 
Wednesday to face the 
Tuskers. IPFW swept three 
sets, 15-7, 17-15, and 15-3, to 
register its first win of the 
season. Ohio Northern was 
the scheduled opponent, but 
called off the match late 
Tuesday evening, Ball said. 

After winning the first set 
handily, IPFW led the 
Falcons 14-9 in the second 
set, but six straight Bible 
College points left the 
Tuskers trailing 15- 
14. They regrouped and won 
the set 17-15. "The younger 
kids really grow in that kind 
of situation," Ball com- 
mented. "They showed a lot 
of character and a lot of 
heart." 

The Tuskers came back 
strong in the final set, 
running up an 11-0 lead on 
the way to coasting to a 15-3 
win. Paul Wyss and Pat 
Menzie led the way on some 
vicious spiking. "1 was very 
pleased with our play," Ball 
said. "It was nice to finally 
play at home," even if Bible 
College did bring a cheering 
contingent far outnumbering 
the Tusker partisans. 

Pleased, however, was not 
a word Ball used to describe 
IPFW's state tournament 
play last weekend, though 
the Tuskers did win two 
matches. 
The format of the tour- 
nament was a little unusual. 
Each team played two sets 
to 11 points with the other 
four squads. The teams were 
then seeded by record for a 
single-elimination tour- 
nament. IPFW was seeded 
third after splitting eight 
sets. 

The Tuskers topped 
Midwest Intercollegiate 
Volleyball Association, foe 
Earlham, 11-7 and 11-0, and 
the Ball State club team. 11-7 
and 11-8. Freshman Joe 
Hammons served all 11 
points in the shutout of 
Earlham, prompting Coach

Ball to name him Ihe out- 
standing Tusker player in 
the tournament. IPFW lost 
both sets to the BSU varsity 
squad, 11-7, 11-4, and 
dropped two heartbreakers 
to Notre Dame by identical 
11-9 scores. 

In the semi-finals, the 
Tuskers wereseeded against 
Notre Dame, with the Irish 
eliminating the locals 11-0,8- 



11, 11-3. 



"We were 



consistent all day," Ball 
said. "We'd play well and 
then play really terrible, like 
the 11-0 game." 

The first conference game 
of the year is on tap for 
Saturday at 2 p.m. against 
Cincinnati, a game that will 
be played at New Haven 
Junior High School due to a 
scheduling problem. The 
Tuskers have already 
dropped two matches to the 
Bearcats, in the Ohio State 
and Pittsburgh invitationals. 
In its second meeting, 
IPFW played competitively 
in both sets, and Ball is 
"very optimistic" about his 
squad's chances Saturday.
