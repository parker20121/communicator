Indiana University-Purdue University at Fort Wayne 



August 29, 1985 



Computer institute opens 



RyELE,\NOR LAIRD 
Slalf Writer 

The START division of the Greater 
Fort Wayne Area Chamber of Com- 
merce. IPFW, and local businesses 
have joined lo establish the CAD-CAM 
Training Institute which opened Aug, 19 
in room 205 of Kettler Hall. The $2.2 
million eighl-lerminal system was built 
,and installed by Compulervision 
Corporation, a worldwide company 
specialiiing in compuler-aidbd design 
technology and equipment. 

The CAD-CAM Institute will provide 
training programs for the novice to 
sophisticated engineering analysis 
programs for the long-lime user. It 
offers workshops for high school 
students and businesses, as well as 
college credit courses to students 
enrolled in post-secondary programs. 
No additional tuition is paid to the In- 
stitute by students enrolled m regular 
college courses. Drafting and 
Engineering instructors can use the 
equipment to entance their programs 
of study 

The Institute is open Monday through 
Friday, 8 a.m. to 11 p.m.; and Satur- 
days, B a.m. lo 6 p.m 

The equipment is available for the 
IraiTung of employees of local com- 
panies thinking of installing CAD-CAfW 
systems. 

Courses presently available through 
the Institute include mechanical, 
electrical, architectural, (engineering 



and construction) and numerical 
control. 

James W. Wright, director of the 
Institute, and Dr. Warren Worthly. 
dean of En^neering Technology and 
Nursing, were trained by Com- 
putervision specialists in a series of 
intensive in-depth courses, Howard 
Arnson, director of START, is 
responsible for Institute policy, fiscal 
oversight, and training objectives. 

The advantages of CAD-CAM are 
numerous, the most obvious benefit 
being faster, more efficient product 
development. By integrating many 
design steps and disciphnes into one 
master data base, errors are 
minimized, control and product 
reliability are improved, and cost is 
reduced. 

The system enables the operator to 
create, display, and manipulate a 
three-dimensional model through every 
stage in color. As modiTication is made 
to the 3-D model during the design 
process, the system automatically 
updates all entities associated with the 
change, providing an acciu-ate basis for 
subsequent design, drafting, and 
manufacturing tasks.- 

The system's exceptional graphics- 
processing speed facilitates dimen- 
sional surface analysis, tolerance 
calculations, and final design op- 
timization. No one person, however, 
knows everything the sophisticated 
system can do

Traffic 
improves 
at IPFW 

By DEBORAH A, STARKS 
Chief Reporter 

Traffic flows smoother around 
Coliseum Boulevard East as you enter 
and leave the IPFW campus. This is 
due lo the widening of West Campus 
Drive. 

Other improvements include: the cut 
back and rounding of the area around 
the fiag pole and the widening of the 
intersection between Flag Pole Drive 
and West Campus Drive. 

"A counting of vehicles during heavy 
traffic hoursatnoon, 6, 7and9p m was 
used to determine if improvements lo 
the area were needed," said John 
Carnaghi, Vice Chancellor tor 
Financial Affairs. 

Professor Harold Michael, an In- 
ternational Traffic Specialist and head 
of the School of Civil Engineering at 
Purdue University, West Lafayette, 
was called in as a consultant. The plan 
was designed after his meeting with the 
chief of police and the director of the 
physical plant. 

' 'These improvements were done at a 
cost of 53^.609. Monies are allocated for 
campus improvement from the 
Campus Development Reserve," said 
Carhaghi 

Companies interested in bidding on 
the job, look copies of plans that were 
drawn up by the physical plant at West 
Lafayette, Companies then turn in 
sealed bids and the Purdue Trustee 
Board selected the company with the 
lowest most acceptable bid. 

The company awarded this contract 
was the Wayne Asphalt and Con- 
struction Company. 

"A number of positive comments 
have been received concerning the 
improvements to West Campus Drive," 
said Carhagh). 

"I think it was a good idea, traffic 
should move faster," said Kathy 
Mollenkaph, a senior. 

"I think it was a good decision," said 
Jim Wasmuth, a communication 

"It is a lot better than before. I think 
it needed improvement," said student 
Angela Morgan.

IPFW student discounts may be unavailable 



By ANGELA FRANCE 
Chief Reporter 

Many of the discounts offered in the 
past by area businesses to holders of 
IPFWs student ID. cards may be 



unavailable this year. 

Before last year students were issued 
student discount cards, which were 
valid al several restaurants and other 
stores close to IPFW. But advertising 




Mary Bougber gels her student ID picture taken. Last year several discounts at 
local stores were offered to ID holders (photo by Mike Claburrl). 



businesses had to pay approximately 
$300 to be included on the card, and, 
according to Don Gorney, former IPFW 
student body president, the businesses 
were not finding enough of an increase 
in business due lo the card to justify the 
expense. Many students were unaware 
the discount card existed. 

Last year Gorney came up with an 
idea which solved that problem. He 
proposed students use their regular ID. 
card In lieu of the student discount 
card, thus saving the businesses the 
expense of issuing the separate card. "I 
had a couple of major projects last 
summer," said Gorney, "and the I.D. 
discount thing took a lot of time." 

Getting different businesses to agree 
to offer students a discount involved 
sending out form letters in bulk. Those 
taisinesses interested sent back the 
letter, including their proposed 
discount. Flyers listing the names of 
participating stores were then 
distributed to Ihe students. 

This year, however, the maihng of 
the form letters did not get ac- 



complished. Gorney. who ran for the 
office of student body vice-president, 
wanted to see the discounts offered 
again this year. He agreed that if he 
was elected he would once again 
assumethetask, but he lost the election 
and took a summer job which did not 
allow him the opportunity to take on the 
time-consuming process. 

"I had hoped that Joe Motherwell 
(current student body president) would 
find someone to do it." said Gorney, 
"but at this point it's kind of late lo get 
it done yet this year." 

Gorney said some of last year's 
participating Ixisinesses contacted him 
and expressed an interest in continuing 
the discount. He referred them to 
Motherwell, and expressed the hope 
student government would be able to 
contaclpie rest of the businesses on the 
list and simply ask that they extend last 
year's offered discounts. 

For the lime being, students who are 
aware of the businesses which par- 
ticipated last year may simply present 
their new 1 D. and ask whether it will be 
honored again this year. 



Car accident takes student's life 



By KELLl KIRKPATRICK 
Staff Writer 

Gwen Lowe had everything going for 
her The 32-year-old mother of three 
was a senior in the School of Public and 
Environmental Affairs (SPEA). a 
Purdue University honor student and a 
future law student. 

But something tragic happened to 
change all thai. 

On July 27, in Putnam County, four 
miles cast of Cloverdale, Lowe was 
heading home on Interstate 70 with six 
passengers — all children — when a 
wrong-way driver struck her 1985 
Mercury Lynx head-on. 

The six children received only minor 



injuries, but Lowe wasn't so lucky. She 
was killed. 

Of the six children in Lowe's car, 
Heidi Dunbar, 14, and Douglas L. Lowe, 
13, were admitted to Hendricks County 
Hospital in Danville. Both have been 
released. 

Mike Perry, 18, and Ivan Gwinn, age 
unavailable, were admitted lo Putnam 
County Hospital in Greencastle. An- 
drew Lowe. 10. and Emily Lowe. 8, 
were treated at Putnam County 
Hospital and released. 

On Aug. 3, Lowe was buried in Lin- 
denwood Cemetery. 2324 West Main. 

State police say they are withholding 
further information until after the 



investigation, but criminal charges are 
pending against the driver of the other 
vehicle, Carol Vanonburg, 39, of Grand 
Haven, Mich., who is in critical con- 
dition at Methodist Hospital In In- 
dianapolis. 

Lowe's husband Val, 36, is missing 
his wife a lot. 

"We've been together since we were 
teenagers. I met her when she was U 
and we got married after I got out of the 
service (Armyl. 

"It's rough without her. She was a 
very, very special person and loved by 
everyone," he said. 

During Lowe's first two yeare al 
IPFW, she was working in various 



departments of the university. One of 
her jobs was with financial aid. 

Her colleagues there say they will 
miss this "vibrant" co-worker who 
always seemed lo "know where she was 
going." 

"Marilyn Eley IGSL clerk) heard 
aboul theaccident on the early morning 
news. We were just devastated! It's 
difficult to believe. She would have 
been a senior this year She was hoping 
to go Into law school once she received 
her bachelor's." said Lois Neuman, 
assistant director of financial aid. 

A Fort Wayne native, Lowe was also 
employed by Red Lobster and was a 
member ol Calvary Temple.

Wanted; IPFW chancellor 



What are you waiting for? The trustees of 
other universities have selected chiincellars 
In a matter at weeks. 

A press release thai arrived in The Com- 
municator ofDccs on Aug. 6, 1985. stilted that 
in ihe beginning o( this past summer, the 
position ot chancellor at Indiana University 
Southeast was vacant. 11 continued to an- 
nounce that the vacancy was filled in a matter 
of close to CLghl weeks. 

Come on, Presidents Beering and Ryan, 
you can't kid us. We have all known for about 
a year now, that the position of chancellor at 
IPFW would soon be open for applications. 
The initial ground work could have begun 
lonj ago 

Supposedly, one major obstacle to over- 
come before selecting a search and screen 
committee is to decide to which university. 



Purdue or Indiana, the new chancellor will 
report. This problem should have been 
resolved long before this stage in the game. 

Please think of the students and how this 
lack of proper leadership is affecting the 
education they receive at [FPW, not to 
mention IPFW"s reputation in the local 
community. 

All we're asking is for officials to get 
something done soon to let us know we won't 
be forever ruled by a part-time acting cha- 
ncellor 

Is the question of to whom the chancellor 
will report important enough to drag this out 
for another full year? 

You had better begin work soon — before 
Acting Chancellor Edward A. Nicholsen asks 
if there is money allowed in the budget for 
office redecorating...

Rusty Gucci belts? They're all the same 




Rusty belts &amp; 
Gucci belts 

At a recent conference, the 
nation's Midwestern 
governors objected to their 
region being referred to as 
the "Rust Belt." Some parts 
of the Midwest can be more 
accurately called the 
■■Tightened Belt," 

The original "belt" was 
the Bible Belt of the Old 
South where every town 
proudly claimed to be the 
Buckle. These towns had no 
bars where you could toss 
down a few belts. 

Not all oi the South is Bible 
Bell, For example, in never- 
a-dull-moment Miami it has 
become the cartridge belt. 

Then, of course, there is 
the Sun Belt — which is the 
Bible Belt with industrial 
parks and white wine, These 
industrial parks of the Sun 
Belt arc populated by 
Yuppies who wear Gucci 
bells. 

Roll out the dough 

Now hear this, all you 
successful lawyers, bank 
presidents and corporate 
execs — il's time to pay up 
those 20-year-old, low- 
interest student loans. Your 
Uncle Sam has carried you 
longer than your mothers 
did.

Commentary 

By MICHELE SH,\FFER 
Managing Editor 

"Play baUl" Two words 
that local professional 
baseball fanatics are 
yearning lo hear, if only Ihe 
righl people would stop 
dragging Iheir feet and at 
least move to a slow trot. 

For several months now. 
the Metro Sports Council has 
labored over the idea of 
building a baseball stadium 
in Korl Wayne to attract 
minor league baseball to the 
Summit City. The Council 
had the Silver Springs. 



Maryland, consulting firm of 
Hammer, Siter, and George 
Associates conduct a study 
on the feasibility, cost and 
proper location of a stadium 
in Fort Wayne, 

In (he second phase of the 
study, the firm named the 
fallowing four besi possible 
sites for a baseball stadium 
in order of their at- 
tractiveness; 

1. The vacant 27 acres of 
land across Ihe St Joseph's 
River from the IPFW that is 
county owned and is 
presently leased lo the 
university. The land has 
been offered virtually free of 



cost to the city for the pur- 
poses of building a stadium. 

2 Carrington Field, right 
across the road from the 
IPFW site, adjacent to the 
Allen County Memorial 
Coliseum. 

3. Fourth and Clinton Sis., 
the present location of 
Superior Companies, Inc., a 
metal recycling firm This 
site is near the proposed 
Headwaters Stale Park. 

4 The downtown block 
adjacent to the Grand Wayne 
Center, bordered by Baker 
and Harrison Sts., and 
Fairfield and Jefferson 
Boulevards. 

Earlier this summer, the 



Allen County Council offered 
S3 million in general 

obligation bonds to help build 
the stadium on the county- 
owned property at IPFW. 
However, Mayor WinTield C 
Moses said he would oppose 
any bond issue for a stadium 
located outside the proposed 
Headwaters State Park. 

Moses seems to be 
ignoring the findings of the 
Maryland consulting firm, 
which incidentally charged 
$70,000 lo conduct the study. 
In an article m The Journal- 
Gazette on July -1. Moses was 
quoted as saying. "11 wilt 
undoubtedly take somewhat 



longer Uo build the stadium 
at the state park site), but I 
don't think Ihat that should 
be the primary concern. If 
you put up a good stadium in 
the best possible place, they 
(prospective teams) will 
tieal a path to your door- 
step." 

Although a good stadium is 
foremost, lime is essential 
also. A Ray Smith, chair- 
man of Ihe American 
Association Expansion 
Committee said that there 
are plans to expand with 
more teams by 19B6, and two 
more again in 1988. "If they 
(Fort Wayne) hada facility, 
i( would be a logical place lo

go," Smith said However, if 
t^e downtown location at 
Fourth^and Clinton Sts. is 
agreed upon, we may as well 
forget luring professional 
baseball to Fort Wayne until 
al least 1990. 

Common sense dictates 
that the influential com- 
munity leaders on the MSC 
lake a loc* at the time, ex- 
pense and practicality of 
building a stadium at the 
Clinton St. location, as 
compared to the IPFW site 

Time: It would take 18 
months to clear the land at 
Fourth St. and Clinton St 
The land at IPFW stands 
vacant and open for con- 
struction lo begin. 

Expense: The site at 
Fourth and Clinton Sts.

How do 1 know who Is old? 

Our society has defined 
■■old" in the 1935 Social 
Security Act as age $5. In 
1953 there were 27.4 million 



"old" persons in the United 
States— 11.7 percent. In 2030 
thai percentage could be 
212! Businesses vary in 
their definition of aged. 
Some offer senior citizen 
discounts lo those who are 
SOI Old IS a chronological, 
attitudinal, behavioral. 
physiological and 
sociological matter. Some 
young people appear to be 
much older and vice ver^a. 



We a 



I old, ■ 



as you feel." Bernard 
Baruch said, "Old is always 
15 years older than 1 am." 
What will It mean l« me that 



1 old? 



Old will mean that you 
have hved long, that you 
have survived, and that you 
are not a sissy Bemg old is 



"great" according to 
Maurice Chevalier, "'con- 
sidering the alternative." 
Being old may mean thai you 
are Ihe last of your family or 
friends to be alive, You may 
be the oldest at the picnic or 
in the photograph that will 
become a family heirloom. 



It may be that they will 
need to care for your 
physical needs. They may 
need lo provide en- 
couragement, diversion, 
stimulation, and even 
financial support. How do 
the worcb of the birthday 
cards which they send lo you 
now reveal their reassuring 



or cutting views of the 
landmarks by which we 
count our days? 

What will It mean to our 
larger society that I am old? 

In July 1983, for the first 
time the over-65 population 
outnumbered the teens in the 
U.S. By 2020 teens will be 
outnumbered by two-lo-one 
Human-service career 
persons will be in greater 
demand in our technological 
world. Businesses will focus 
on products and advertising 
to capture the older con- 
sumers' dollars. 

What will you call me when I 
am old? 

Perhaps elderly, golden- 
ager, old crony, senior 



citizen, person in later years. 
or Ihird-ager will be applied 
lo you, There are demeaning 
labels as well. Labels 
throughout life can be 
limiting and indeed 
damaging. Ageism is the 
biasing and discriminating 
perpetuating of myths &lt;rf 
aging. If you will live life to 
its fullest, you will shun such 
labels and the attitudes 
which allow them to be used. 
Who will I be when I am old? 
You will be who you are 
now — only more so! A 
joiner, a complainer, a 
talker, a visionary, a leader, 
an enthusiast? Self-centered, 
dependent, cautious? Know 
yourself as you are now. Do 
you like who you are now and 
how you are developing? 



Don't avoid the bother of buckling up; buckle up 



By KELLl KIRKPATRICK 
Staff Wriler 

Only 10 percent of 
Americans buckle up every 
lime they get in an 
automobile. 

Of the 35,000 people killed 
last year in automobile 
accidents, 9,000 of them 



could have been saved if only 
they had worn a seat belL 

Some people auto- 
matically buckle up the 
moment they get behind the 
wheel, while others never 
even think about it. Why is 
this so? Psychologist Paul 
Slovic says the main reason 
may be because of the way 



people perceive risks. 

The chance of a serious 
accident appears slim by 
statistics — only one serious 
crash per 100.000 car trips. 
"Each safe trip rewards the 
non-use of seal belts, the 
bother of buckling up has 
been avoided without in- 
jury," Slovic said. 



But viewed from a 
lifetime, a driver's per- 
spective may change 
drastically Since people 
take an average of 45,000 car 
trips over the course of a 
lifetime, the chance of being 
in an accident is nearly one 



Ne\ 



York.. . Illinois, 



Michigan and New Jersey 
have mandatory seat belt 
laws. Indiana may soon 
follow. 

Some advice Slovic gives 
about seal belts. "Make 
wearing seat belts automatic 
so it's no longer a matter of 
decision."

IPFW sponsors first peace and understanding festival

What conlribution can one 
person make to world peace? 

One answer is to leam 
more about different 
cultures and cooperation in 
order (o understand each 
other's uniqueness The 
Festival of Peace and Un- 
derstanding resulted from a 
desire lo further peace when 
the world seems (o be on the 
brink of nuclear holocaust. 

The festival stemmed 
from a desire by many in the 
community lo formally 
remember the war-time use 
of the atomic bomb 40 years 



tomorrow. Thus the festival 
offers games that leach 
cooperalion rather than 
competition, puppet shows, 
and story telling." 

"The program ideas were 
developed during a brain- 
storming session," said 
Donald McCord, chairman of

*Our Place' is now everybody's place 



By LISA HENRY 
Staff Writer 

Editor's Note: This Is ihe 
first In a series on Fori 
Wayne nlghl life. 

Our Place 

Don'l let the name fool 
you. Via the mass media and 
Ernest Hemingway, Ihe 
words "our place" carry a 
connotation of seclusion and 
privacy — the out-of-the-way 

Our Place 

nook in the corner of a 
metropolis where a tiny 
group of friends gathers to

celebrate. They go to I heir 

No longer does the con- 
notation stand. Since 1983 
when theclub made its debut 
in the Marketplace of 
Canterbury, scores of folks 
hit Ihe spot nightly, 

"Our Place is now 
everybody's place," 

According lo IPFW 
students. Our Place's 
magnetism derives from Ihe 
utter comfort and en- 
joyability of the bar, Tom 
Ferguson, IPFW junior, 
notes that Our Place is the 
place where students can 
relax and have a good time. 



J=lrll.l.ljc^.l,',IA 



Tom also praises the location 
in relation to campus, "It's 
easy lo get to." 

Kirk Scheumann. 21, 
however, feels thdt Our 
Place's customers are 
"people going out to get 
crazy," but maintains that 
the bar does not gel too wild. 

Another attraction of Our 
Place may possibly come 
from the clientele itself. 
Karen Brunson, IPFW 
senior, notes that the crowd 
is younger, for the most part, 
while other students have 
seen the likes of Young 
Urban Professionals en- 
joying a drink. 



Our Place draws some 
customers in for the simple, 
homey charm of the British 
pub which holds a mere 235 
people 

The bar is owned by Jon 
and Cheryl Didier who also 
manage the place. Cheryl 
comments that IPFW 
sludenls travel thai way for 
lunch and a t&gt;eer, and oc- 
casional book cracking. 

Such diligence on the 
weekends, though, is not 
recommended because the 
place fills to capacity and 
may not provide a studious 
atmosphere 

The excuses for 

patronizing the establish- 



ment range from un- 
derstandable lo unreal, yet 
scores of people take pride in 
announcing that they go to 
Our Place 

Ultimately the reasons for 
delving into the nighilife of 
Our Place do not mailer The 
fact is thai basically people 
enjoy Ihe unkempt, oft- 
kilter, wholesomeness of the 
little place Some might even 
compare it lo home. 

No longer does "Let's 
meet al our place" spark 
visions of solitary can- 
dlelight and romantic 
aloneness, bul rather images 
of an open and hearty good 
lime with fellow students.

Rambo wins the crown for box office hits 



By JULIE BOBILYA 
Stair Writer 

Like every other summer, 
the summer of 1985 brought 
us a varied selection of 
movies ranging (rom 
"Follow That Bird,^^ a 
Sesame Street movie for 
toddlers, to ■'Ramtw: First 
Blood Part II, ■' strictly for 
adults, due lo the violent 
theme of the film. While this 
season had its box office 
sellouts, most of the movies 
released were of mediocre 
quality, 

Undisputabiy, the most 
popular film of the summer 
of 1985 was "Rambo: First 
Blood Part It," starring the 



muscular Sylvester Stallone 
in the leading role Running 
a close second place was 
Stephen Spielberg's science 
fiction comedy, "Back to the 
Future," with Michael J. 
Fox of Family Ties 

Among this summer^s 
other, but not oulle as suc- 
cessful, films are "Mad 
Max: Beyond the Thun- 
derdome.^' a sequel to '■Road 
Warrior" and "Mad 
Max;" "St. Elmo's Fire;" 
"Fletch;" "Weird Science;" 
■'My Science Project;" and 
'Real Genius." 

The laic summer releases 
are currently enjoying 
unexpected success. 
"Volunteers," a Bing 



Crosby-Bob Hope style 
comedy, casts John Candy 
and Tom Hanks as 1962 Yale 
graduates who join the 
Peace Corps They 
inevitably meet a beautUul 
lady, with whom they must 
build a bridge as their first 
assignment The bridge will 
be built in a jungle area, 
providmg an unusual en- 
vironment (or a very (unny 
movie 

"Pee Wee's Big Ad- 
venture. " starring Pee Wee 
Herman as himseK is 
another late summer sur- 
prise. For those individuals 
who like Pee Wee's brand of 
humor, this movie is a mu3t- 



The movie theaters in Fort 
Wayne are expecting to 

bring back some of last 
summer's smash hit movies, 
as well-.as hold over some of 
this year's successes. The 
Gateway Cinema and 
Quimby Village Theatre are 
showing "Ghostbuslers," 
while Georgetown Theaters 
will keep "Pee Wee's Big 
Adventure" and bring back 
Spielberg's c lassie. 
"Gremlins." A new release 



that looks promising is 
"Teen Wolf," which features 
Michael J. Fox as a teenager 

who periodicaUy becomes a 
werewolf The story is 
handled differently than in 
the past, making Ihe teenage 
werewolf the center of social 
attention while the pereonna 
of the student is ostracized 
by his peers. 

The extended outlook in 
the movie industry reveals 



"The Jewel o( the Nile." a 
sequel to "Romancing the 
Stone," the swashbuckling 
adventure saga starring 
Michael Douglas and 
Kathleen Turner, The duo 
will return, assuming new 
characters. 

The trend for science 
fiction, fantasy and ad- 
venture movies will continue 
into next year with the 
release of this sequel

IPFW's Symphonic Winds 
Group, formally known as 
the Winds Ensemble, i5 
under new direction this 
year 

Dr. George Cavanagh, 
whose last position was as 
chairman of the Department 
of Music at Hartwick College 
in Oneonta, New York, held 
auditions for the musical 
ensemble Saturday. Aug. 24 
through the 27. The group, 
which consists of about 45 to 
49 players will begin prac- 
ticing Monday, Wednesday 
and Friday from 3-1:20 p.m. 

Cavanagh said that any 
IPFW student is eligible to 
participate. "Though a good 
number o( members in past 
years have been music 
majors, many will not be. 
There have t&gt;een many non- 
major, very talented 
musicians." 

As in years past, Ihe 
Symphonic Winds Group has 
several special events 
planned In addition lo 
performing free conceri,s on 
campus, Cavanagh has oUier 
activities in mind (or the

Area top runners to compete for IPFW 



ByTAMERICE 
Chief Hep orler 

If KW cross country team 
rosier reads like a who's who 
In Fori Wayne distance 
running. Second year coach 
Barrie Peterson has 
assembled a group that 
includes three runners (rom 
last year's semi-state 
qualifying team at Snider 
High School, as well as 
several others who have 
made Iheir mark locally. 

The lop catch could be 
Snider's number one runner 
from a year ago, Victor 
Turner Turner was the 
are.i's number one runner in 



both cross country and 
track. He earned firet place 
finishes in the sectional, 
regional and semi-state, 
before being named to the 
all-state cross country 
learns. Joining Turner will 
be Iwo other Snider fresh- 
men, Jeff Salay and Doug 
Sawyer. Sawyer was 
Snider's number two runner 
and Salay was their fifth 
runner. 

But Peterson won't have to 
tolaUy rely on new faces to 
provide his winning fortunes 
this year. The Mastodons 
return (our-year veteran and 
captain Tom Hoffman 
iBellmonti and Rich Jereb 




I Carroll), who is back for his 
second year after coming off 
a four-year enlistment in the 
Marines. 

"We will have a young 
learn, but we should also 
have some depth and a lot of 
ability," Peterson said, 
"Although we only have two 
returners coming bach, we 
still have some maturity on 
the team since a tew of Ihe 
runners have been away 
from the sport for a year or 
so. 

"IPFW is beginning to 
attract some of the lop area 
runners, particularly from 
Snider and Northrup high 
schools," 

Joining the Mastodons Ihis 
year will t&gt;e Todd Eagen and 



Steve McNulty of Bishop 
Dwenger; Mark Kuhn, Pat 
Rice and Randy Widdifled of 

Northrup: Dan Martin of 
East Side; Jeff Messman of 
Heritage; Bob Swineharl of 
Churubusco; Steve Voitiein, 
a former Snider runner. 

Rice and Widdified are 
probably the best products of 
the group, based on past 
performances Rice earned 
all-stale honors in high 
school and was a three-time 
a 11- conference and all-area 
pick. He served two years in 
the Marine Corps before 
joining Ihe team. Widdilield 
was twice an all-conference 
selection. 

"We have a very bright 
outlook wilh such a young 



team," Peterson said '"The 
kids are seeking us out now. 
and I beheve that wiU give 
the program a big boost now 
and in the years to come." 

IPFW will also have two 
women competing in the 
women's division. Carol 
VanHorn of Woodlan and 
Kristi Walker of Harding are 
both excellent prospects. 
Walker is a transfer from 
Northwestern University in 
Evanston, HI., and a three- 
lime Indiana State cross 
country champion, VanHom 
was one of Woodlan's top five 
runners. 

The Mastodons begin Iheir 
season Aug, 31 at 
Valparaiso's Division 1 
Invitational Run, 



New golf coach named 



David Skelton, athletics 
director at IPFW. has an- 
nounced the appointment of 
Bruce Mahlock as the 
Mastodons' new golf coach. 
Mahlock replaces Don

An avid golfer and fan,

Walther League basketball 
team in 197S, He has also 
assisted for an "A" division 
slo-pitch Softball team and a
