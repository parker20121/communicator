Mars &amp; Venus | why are celebrity couples so interesting? 



By CrclchEH Hahn ind Aim 



Mare Asks: I recently vent- 
ed my fnutralion on those gos- 
sip magazines that ladies seam 
to enjoy so much. Well. \ recent- 
Iv saw something in one of those 
that actually infuriated me and 
teminded me of yet another 
thing that I don't imdeistand: 
female fascination with celebrity 

Now before I go on, allow 
me lo explain that 1 wasn't actu- 
ally reading the magazine. 1 was 
simply walking through a Wal- 
Mart, minding my own business 
when suddenly 1 slipped {proba- 
bly on snow that had melted) 
and fell into the magazine rack. 
When 1 regained consciousness, 
on the floor ne»l to me was one 
of these magazines. It had 
opened lo qn article featuring 
Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez. 



and t kid you not, in big, bold 
letters it lead "... And They Said 
It Wouldn't Last:" This maga- 

their relationship a successl 
Why? Because it lasted three 
months? 

In no way is this real jour- 
nalism (not that this column is). 
So please, Venus, explain your 
obsession with celebrity couples 
whose relationships don't work 
out 99.999 percent of the time. 
And if they do lost, it's usually 
only because one of the 
celebs died prematurely. 

1 think that you ladies have 
a pool going where you bet to 
see how long each couple will 
last! Kind of like that Clint 
Eastwood film (Eastwood is an 
awesome actor who started in a 

you were wondering) where 
rich dudes bet on which celebri- 
ties will die first. 



Venus Responds: He really 

doesn't get it, does he girls? 
Okay, let me try to explain this 
relationship /rendezvous lasci- 
nationl Honestly, I could care 
less to know the true feelings 
between Ben and (en. and if they 
last ornot is of no concern to me. 
The significance of celebrity 
romances to women is the glit- 
tery glam of it all. Women like to 
bo wooed and if a five-carat rock 
doesn't do it, then 1 don't know 

As (ar as your "(oumalisls" 
claiming they can detect Ibe 
longevity of one's relationship 
seems lo be a bit off, I'll agree! 
Hoivever, if lhei( predictions arc 
right, these classy journalists 
will have a (ollow-up piece in 
order to proclaim themselves 
right once again! 

The thing you've got to rec- 
ogiuze is that these writers see 
just as much as we see. For the 
most part, these people don'l

more than we give them credit 
for — and no place is sacred 
anymore. 

Not even your toilet. 

Noiv I have evidence that 
they are reproducing with more 
vigor in the fact that I have had 
more mouse and rat dealings in 
the past six months than I have 
had in Ihe past ID years- 

And I lived on a slup during 
part of that time, ivhere we 
seemingly recruited rodents to 
guard and/or sample our fine 
cuisine of dried milk and stale, 
roach-infested cereal. 

Sometimes, while swab- 
bing a deck, you'd hear them 
lolly gagging. Often they argue 
about mouse topics, like if 
they'd prefer having Mighly's 
flight ability and strength, or 
Mickey's wealth and power, 

"With Mighty 's flying and 
strength, you wouldn't need 
wealth or power because you 
could go anyivhere. anytime, 
and do anything you wan led," 

"Yes, but with Mickey's 
wealth and power, you ivould 
have your own jet and pay mice 
to do anything you wanted." the 
other would respond. 

Like so many arguments, it 
was circular. 

Even on that ship, the 
human-rodent ratio was less 
than it is in America. 

They are showing up in 
places you would never want 
Ihem to be (as I indicated, your

Being a concerned husband — 
and presumably a loilet-user 
himself — he contacted officials 
to report the incident. Instead ol 
laughing, they admitted it could 
be a problem.

The Beautys rock Magilla's 



By Michelle Morris 
Curst Columnist 

Whether there's drunken 
fights, inebriated dancing or just 
heavy drirtking, ifs always an 
entertaining Thursday night at 
Magilla's Redneck Punltock 
Night in New Haven. This past 
Thursday was no different. The 
Beautys invited their friends, 
The Palsys, to play It ivas the 
night for the ladies to rock out, 
well at least I'd hof&gt;ed. 

The everting started with a 
seitse uf hatred in the air and 
drama to go along with it. A few 
fights were averted, but that 
didn't stop the angry glares 
excluingcd from across the bar. 

Eventually, the situation 
was soothed and everybody had 
a good time. Thai is, everybody 
had a good time unlit the opening 
band started to play. 

The Patsys. hailing from 
Columbus. Ohio, proved that a 
great fashionsense makes up lor 
lack of originality 

! realized my expectations 



must have been too high after 
seeing most of the band dressed 
like ElvLS Costello. They belted 
out pop rock tunes in the vein of 
Letters to Cleo, Their catchy guitar 
riffs made up for the inadequate 
male-female vocals. 

The highlight of their set 
was the last song. 
"You're Gotma Pay," a humorous 
rock ballad written for female 
vocalist. Tuth Jackson's husband. 
Overall, they were entertaining, 
bull wasglad I didn't pay to get in. 

Even though it wasn't hard 
to do. Fort Wayne legends. The 
Beautys, stole the show. 

Many skeptics watched as 
Kay slageercd onstage with a 
dollar bill hanging out of her 
bosom and a drink m her hand. 
She immediately won them over 
when she started to play 

The Beautys belled out 
their classic surf-punk sound 
with a set ol old classics and 
new hits. It was obvious to those 
in aHpndance why they were 
voted Best Regional Band by 
Punkrock Night at the Melody 



Inn in Indianapolis. Check out 
Iheir brand new CD of 7s, lost 
tracks, out takes and oddities. 
You can order "The First Seven 
Inches are Always the 
Hardest-..." from llsir V*b site 
wivw.thebeautys«jm. 

Surprisingly, niany of Fort 
Wayne's music elite were out 
supporting the scene. In 
attendance were members of the 
Sods. Tri Stale Killing Spree. It's 
a M,A.N.S. World, Fat Ass. 
Friday the 13th. the Blue Moon 
Boys, Low Life, Victoria's 
Secretioits and the Lurking 
Corpses. Who said that local 



Alt in all, the show was 
commendable. I've never been 
disappointed with the entertain- 
ment value of Magilla's Redneck 
Punkrock Night. There's always 
some rock 'n roll, in'losication 
and fish cuffs.

Debut EP doesn't fail senses 






in factor on ttus powerful 



Sure, more often than not, 
they can be quite odd. But there 
is no denying the talent of the 
youngest band on the most 
rapidly rising record label in 
punk music. With the likes of 
New Found Glory and 
Something Corporate leading 
the ^vay, Drivc-'Thru Records is 
onits way to being the best. And 
sure, up-and-coming bands like 
The Starling Line, Early 
November and Finch help. But, 
it's the fresh punk ol New 
Jersey-based Senses Fail that 
will lead this label through 2003. 

The edgy band was originally 
formed in August 2001 with 
front man Buddy Nielsen and 
guitarist Garrett Zablocki, After 
a failed attempt at keeping the 
band together. Senses Fail called 
it quits, but re-formed in 



Trapp. The c^uartel was soon 
joined by bassist Mike Glita, 

In 2002. the band released 
their debut EP "From Depths of 
Dreams" on ECA Records shortly 
before signing on with Drive- 
Thru. The youth of the band is a 
bi^ help to their sometimes 
childish, yet fresh anhcs. lyrics 
and music. The band's ages 
range from 20-year-old Glita 



The six song disk starts off 
with the depressing cut 
"Stephen." The song delves into 
feelings for a lost loved one. The 
very real lyncs depict the death 
of a young man named Stephen. 

Nielsen's unique vocal 
style accentuates the line 
'Losing in the fall, lost mnocence 
came down; an tS-year-old boy 
was buried m the ground." and 
makes it have even more of a 
saddening impact. 
However, the 



The second song "Free Fall 
Without a Parachute is good in 
idea, but lacks in sound. The 
recording is the worst of all of 
the songs. It is slightly muffled 
which distracts from the music

shines through on this track. 

"The Ground Folds" makes 
you listen right away with the 
catchy guitar riffs that start the 
track off Yet another song delving 
into losing a loved one. 

This track however shows 



lyric. 



? by far the 



line, '-Well I had 

rtight, and in my dream 1 took a 

knife to you." 

It goes on to describe the 
murderous thoughts of a 
seemingly disturbed person. It's 
not hard, however, to realize 
that the lyrics probe into the 
thoughts of a regretful potential 
criminal who feels remorse for 
crimes he commits, even if they 

"Bloody Romance" gives 

the disc a somewhat pop cut 

midway through the EP. Make 

mistake however; It' 



what keeps attention near a 
peak for this track. 

Wrapping up the debut 
release of this young band is my 
personal favorite track "One 
ighl Seven." Ask anyone who

Nielsen's unique vocal 
styling shines through brighlei' 
than ever on this track. Once 
again delving into the devastation 
of an ended relationship. But on 
this track, Senses Fail compares 
the pain to being killed. The

during this song. 

While each is different in its 

realization that there is a "heart- 
breaking breakup" song on 
every CD of every musician. It 
kind of grates on my nerves 
after a while. The energetic 
Nielsen also goes hardcore punk 
on this song with a wide array of 
screaming that would make 
Rancid proud. 

Up next is the slowerpaced 
"Dreaming a Reality." This is 

Erobably my least overall 
ivorite song on the EP. The 
sane lacks the ability to really 
catch my attention. I'm not saying 
that it's not a good song; it just 
doesn't stand up to the rest of 
the damn good songs on the

3. S«nscs Fail 
ver on "One 
Eight Seven" that they may be 
song writers to reckon with in 
the future. 

All in all. Senses Fail gels 
the job done here and ends the 
EP on a very good note. 

If I have intrigui;d you 
enough. I highly recommend 
heading over to MP3.COM and 
downloading the three songs 
from this EP that are available. 
Sadly enough, the EP itself is a 
rare commodity and can only be 

Kjrchased online, though it may 
; hard to find. 

In addition, you can look 
more deeply into the lives of 
Senses Fail on the Drive-Thru 
Records DVD. which is available 
now. The DVD features a video 
montage of Senses Fail concerts, 
set to the song "One Eight 
Seven" and a humorous in tervieiv 
with the band. Senses Fail is 
wilhout a doubt on the scope of 
the punk music future.

With the cicepb on oF coaches 
and players, no one realty kirows 
what (vcnl on in Saturday morning's 
men's volleyball practice- 

Whatever it was, though, il 
worked. 

After falling to No. 10 UC- 
Sania Barbara in five games 
Friday. 27-30, 26-30, 30-21. 30-36 
and 13-15, the IPFW men's 
volleyball team rebounded to 
dominate the Gauihos on 
Sunday, beating them in three 
games, 30-27. 30-15 and 30-25. 

"It was important for us to 
get of( to a good start ioi a couple 
reasons. Obviously, because we 
lost on Friday, but Saturday 
morning wc practiced for an 
hour and a hall and I was pretty 
brutal on them because of our 

fierformance Friday riighl." said 
PFW coach Amie BalF "It was 
real critical that we came out and 
played consistently, and lortimaltly 




nlly at a hijjh 
•intorce the stuff thai I 
tried to impart upon Oiem on 
SatunJay morning." 

The players responded by 
cotitrolhng the match from the 
opening game. 

"[Getting out lo a quick 
start] was huge." said outside 
hitler Jeff Ptak. "We got our 
butts chewed Saturday morning 
by Coach, and we worked really 
hard on fundamentals and wc 
came out strong wilh a lot of 
enthusiasm. It was great to play 

In the first game, the two 
teams traded points until the 
Dons pulled oul to a 9-6 lead

■■[Gelling the winj wasvcry 
important because wc had to 
show that on Friday we could've

'Today, we came more aggres-

today. Dennis did a great job. We 
had to show the rest of Ihe coun- 



try that we have a Final Four 
team right here." 

The mnlch was Plak's firsi 
this season after taking a medical 
red shirt a year ago. 

"I hadn't touched a volleyball 
since October, and I came out a 
little r\i5ty," Ptak said. "I've been 
training hard, but it's Ihe court 
sense. I've got lo gel that back, 
bul it's a great confidence booster 
to be right Ihere." 

Ball said the addition of 
Ptak made a difference in the 
Dons' chemistry. 

- "lolf hns struggled for a Utile 
over a year now. and our guys 
have struggled with him 
because he'.s not only a good 
player, but a good friend." he 
said. "So emotionally, loscc him

Ptak finished wilh 12 kills, ei^f;

Ball Fell that a couple olheH 
players impacted Ihe game as welll 

'The unsung players, Ihere- 
arc actually Iwo of them. One-BK 
Ihem is Javier Garcia who 
played oulside and then came in?

II took officials over 17

stood as indicated: an S8-86 

"The question was, was Ihe

said referee Joe DeRosa. 
'Twenty-four seconds had not 
expitea off the game clock

basket was good and it ivas not 
a shot-clock violation."

The 

Prognosticator 



. I'll admit, I only watched 
line game. Everyone knew the 
Oakland Raiders would win. 
But not loo many people would 
have gone as far as to predict 
that my boys, the Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers would walk out of 
Veterans' Stadium with the NFC 
Championship Trophy. So. as 
Jon Gruden prepares to face off 
ivilh his fomier team, leave it to 
me lo break down ^vhal should 
be an intriguing match. 



Situation: The NFC has won 17 
Super Bowls to the AFC's 15. 
Advantage: Tampa Bay 
My Take: Sadly enough. 1 don't 
think Ibis category favors anyone. 
Sure the NFC has won more 
Super Bowls, but the margin is 
loo slim for it lo hold any real 

Situation: When playing in an 
AFC Stadium, the AFC team has 
won 5 of the 9 games. 
Advantage: Oakland 
My Take: Once again, the mar- 
gin is Ihin, but enough For a big 
advantage. Obviously, Oakland 
will be more used lo the San 
Diego field, which is a huge 
advantage. And then, even 
though Bucs fans will show up 
in mass. Oakland will slay in 

that hoards of OakLind fans will 
make (he short trip to 
Qualcomm Stadium. 

Situation: The Super Bowl expe- 
rience factor. The Raiders arc 3-1 
in the Super Bowl, outscoring 
their opponents 1I1-66. This is 
the first appearance for Ihe Bucs. 
Advantage: Oakland 
My Take: This historic fad 
should be a non-factor Sure the 
Raiders are used to winning Ihe 
big one. Only Ihe Pillsburgh 
Steele rs. Dallas Cowboys and 
San Francisco 49ers have iv-on 
more Super Bowls. Bui consider- 
ing that the Raiders have been 
absent from this game since 1984 
when they won as Ihe Los 
Angeles Raiders, the Bucs 
shouldn't have to worry about a 
Super Bowl record. 



cr Bowl record. 

alion: When pbying 
i/^MC a former champion, 
lV,/llO ,^,3jn5 ip iheir first 
Super Bowl are 3'5. 
Advantage: Oaldand 
My Take: This also 
goes along with Ihe last 
situalion. U Ihe Bucs 
pl.iv their canJs right 
.ind dor'l let uisignificant 
il.itislics like this gel ui their 
heads, il won't matter who has 
been lo the Super Bowl before 
and who hasn't. 

Situation: When both Super 
Bowl learns have had first round 
byes, the NFC is 12-t in the big 
game. 

Advantage: Tampa Bay 
My Take: Both have had equal 
and adeauale rest. The Bucs. 
however, nave obviouslj[ shown 
more strength after their week 
oil. winning their games 58-16 
while Oakland has been victorious 
in their two playolf games, 61-34. 

Situation: Teams that Jerry Rice 
plays for are 4-0 in the Super 
Bowl. 

Advantage: Oakland 
My Take: You got me. Those 
four ivit\s have only been with 
the 49ers. and I'm sure those 
guys by the names of Montana 
and Young had something to do 
\vilh them. I Ihink Rice wilTprelty 
much be a non-factor m the 
game. He's aging and matched 
up with Ronde Barber, he has no 



Situation: Since the AFL/NFL 
merger, the AP Regular Season 
MVp's team has made the Super 
Bowl 18 times, going 9-9. 
Advantage: Push 
My Take; Sure Rich Cannon got 
the MVP nod, but there are plen- 



Brooks and Warren Sapp. |usl 
enough to offsel any advantage 
Gannon's MVP status may have. 

Situation: The Post-Season 
Quarterback Draw. Oakland's 
Rich Gannon has thrown for 569 
yards, 5 touchdowns and 1 
interception. Tampa Bay's Brad 
Johnson has thrown for 355 
yards. 3 touchdowns and 3 
mlercepliorts. 
Advantage: Oakland 
My Take: Rich Gannon is a belter 
quarterback, hands down. The 
advantage in this category is obvi- 
ously in the hands of the Raiders. 

Situation: The Post-Season 
Rushing Combo Package. The 
Raiders have seen Charlie 
Gamer and Zack Crocket rush 
for 143 yards and 2 touchdowns. 
The Bucs lop guys Michael 
Pittman and Mike Alstotl have 
busied out 143 yards and 3 



Mike Alstotl have busied out 
143 yards and three touchdowns. 
Advantage: Tampa Bay 
My Take: These t*vo running 
games couldn't be much more 
identical. However, you can 
have all the yanls you want, it's 
those TDs that matter. Although 
Tampa may only tuive one more, 
an advantage is an advantage. 

Situation: )usl give me the 
damn ball in the post-season. IF 
you're a Tampa Bay QB. you 
know how il goes. You give Ihe 
ball to Key sh awn Johnson, 
Keenan McCardell or Joe 
lurevicius. The three have 
amassed 281 yards receivingand 
two TDs this post-season. 
Oakland's lop three. Jerry Rice, 
Jerry Porter and "Ilm Brown 
have countered wilh 420 yards 
and three TDs. 
Advantage: Oakland 
My TUfC-. Have a better QB, have 

Keyshawn is the best of the six, 
but without an adequate thrower, 
he can't be an adequate receiver. 

Situation: The post-season kick 
off. Sebastian Janikowski has 
been kicking some butt (or Oie 
Raiders. Janikowski has hit five 
field goals and eight extra points 
for 23 points. Martin Gramalica, 
however, has or' "" 

three field goals at 
points for 16 points. 
Advantage: Oakland 
My Take: 1( may seem like 
Janikowski has the advantage, 
but Gramatica's nickname isn't 
"Automalica" for nothing. 

Situation: Defense wins champi- 
onships. The Bucs D has allowed 
an average 269,5 yards of olFerise 
for their opponents; the Raiders 
have given up 2995. 
Advantage: "Tampa Bay 
My Take: It's obvious that if 
Super Bowl XXXVll comes 
down to a defensive game, it 
will be a long night for Oakland. 

Situation: The Overall Picture 
Advantage: Oakland 
My Take: How about a little bit 
of irony for you. The last time 
the Raiders won the Super Bowl 
was in 1984. Anyone remember 
Ihe site of that game? Thai's 
right. Tampa Bay. And as much 
as it may seem like the Raiders 
will have the Dues number 
(numbers do speak for them- 



selves), 1 hardly Ihirk so. In my 
nion, so many fans, joumaf- 
, and the Raiders themselve 



opinion, s 



will be paying lo m 
to this game being considered 
Raiders vs. Gruden and not real- 
ize that it is Raiders vs. Bucs. 
Look For Mike Alstotl and Ronde 
Barber to steal the show and the 
city ot Tampa Bay to celebrate 
into the mght. Mark my words, 
the Bucs will be the team m 2003.
