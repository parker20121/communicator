A Matt and Christine 

Chavez Reunion 

Cousins with equal interest bring community to IPFW 



They are ramily, pre- 
clGsIincd to serve the 
people, excite commu- 
nity, and continue a leg- 
acy that reminds them of 
their roots and purpose. 
Change agenis and equal 
right activists, two mem- 
bers of the Chavez family 
have found time to make 
a difference at IPFW. 

His name is Matt 
Chavez, great-nephew 
of the famous father of 
all community organiz- 
ers, and he is community 
organizing for the Sena- 
tor Obama Campaign 
for Change. An Oak- 
land, California native, 
Chavez would normally 
be teaching history, took 
two semesters off to work 
for Senator Obama, 

His cousin, Christine 
Chavez, the granddaugh- 
ter of Cesar Chavez, com- 
munity organizer and ac- 
tivist (not to be confused 
with Venezuela's Presi- 
dent, Hugo Chavez), and 
a featured guest speaker 
at IPFW's Latino Cultural 
Expressions, which took 
place on Sept. 29 as pan 
of Hispanic National 
Heritage Month. 

Both were in Fort 
Wayne at IPFW as the 
tivo cousins re-united for 
the first time in years. 

As WANE 15 news 
interviewed Christine 
Chavez inside the Walb 
Union Auditorium, Matt 
Chavez was outside the 
union working the IPFW 
campus registering stu- 
dents to vote in the Nov. 
4 election. 

Both continue to 



work in the tradition of 
Osar Chavez, who set 
the gold standard for 
community activist or- 
ganizing in the United 
States. Chavez, bom in 
Arizona, was a Mexican- 
American farm worker 
and a life-long labor or- 
ganizer, public leader, 
and civil rights activist. 
Today, Christine Chavez 
is the District Director 
for State Senate Ma- 
jority Leader Gloria 
Romero. Before that, 
she worked ivith the 
United Farm Workers 
Union, the organiza- 
tion her grandfather co- 
founded over 40 years 
ago. Today, she carries 



so it seemed right lo do it 
together," Chavez said, 

Chavez relayed some 
life stories of her grand- 
father Cesar showing his 
dedication. She talked 
about hunger strikes, her 
grandfather's becoming a 
vegetarian, walkjng picket 
linesacross the USA, train- 
ing farmers and sending 
them to the big cities to 
organize labor organiza- 
tions and refusing to ever 
walk dirough a picket line 
even if it meant sleeping 
in the car. 

Chrisdne's family up- 
bringing bread her for 
community activism and 
labor organizing. She re- 
called waking in Detroit to 



"Both continue to work in 

the tradition of Cesar Chavez, 

who set the gold standard for 

community activist organizing 

in the United states." 



and lives the message of 
her grandfather ofequal 
rights for all by work- 
ing, speaking, organiz- 
ing, networking, and 
supporting equal rights 
causes. 

Recently Christine 
joined Rev. Al Sharpton 
to form the Latino and 
African American Lead- 
ership Alliance. Chavez 
worked with Sharpton 
to organize a march on 
the anniversary of the 
Watts riots of 40 years 
ago, 

"Latinos and Afri- 
can-Americans are both 
fighting for crumbs, and 



boycott v/ith a "No grapes " 
sign. She was arrested 
with her family for refus- 
ing to leave the front of a 
store that sold non-union 
grapes - at the age of four. 
She said when growing 
up, "We didn't have fam- 
ily picnics; we had family 
pickets," 

Chavez said the two 
most important values 
learned from Grandpa 
Cesar were solidarity and 
commitment. She noted 
solidarity means pull- 
ing together with others 
in support of common 
causes. On commitment, 
she said, "Once you start 



something, you have 
to see it through to the 
end." 

Chavez's own commit- 
ment goes to unions 
and causes besides the 
United Farm Workers, 
She was active with the 
Service Employees Inter- 
national Union in Cali- 
fornia, has worked with 
union groups and ani- 
mal rights groups in Cali- 
fornia and Chicago, and 
works with equal rights 
groups across the land. 

She said, "The Latino 
agenda is the American 
agenda plus immigration 
issues." She noted qual- 
ity education, a^ordable 
health care, and equality 
of opportunity and equal 
rights. 

Max Montesino. As- 
sociate IPFW Profes- 
sor and member of the 
United Hispanic Leader- 
ship Council of North- 
east Indiana, introduced 
Chavez. Montesino said. 
"Our country becomes 
better with Christine 
Chavez out there and 
coming here. She lives by 
the values handed down 
by her grandfather," 

That she does, and 
she's not alone in the only 
one in the family. She was 
not alone at IPFW an- 
swering questions. Matt 
was there ivilh her. 

Responding to one. 
cousin Matt said, "We 
must continue to keep 
lighting and use the 
power, as the United 
Farmworkers did, froma 
grassroots movement." 

Cousin Christine 
agreed and concluded, 
"It's absolutely up to us 
to continue the tradi- 
tions." 




The President Speaks 

Funding the student 
experience and the 
benefit of travel 



By KodyTinnet 

Sludcnl Body Pitildent 




TVvo weekends ago the 
four executive officers for 
student government took 
a trip to Washington D.C, 
for the American Student 
Government Association 
National Summit. This 
annual conference is de- 
signed to bring together 
representatives from dif- 
ferent colleges and uni- 
versities from all across 
the country. During the 
event students have 
the chance to engage 
in roundtable discus- 
sions, listen to renowned 
speakers, participate in 
workshops, and network 
with other organizations 
and student government 
members. 

From my perspec- 
tive the conference was 
money well spent. We 
were able to learn about 
different ways in which 
our student government 
can become even bet- 
ter than it already is, al- 
though, I should note 
that compared to many 
other student govern- 
ment associations we are 
doing very well in many 
aspects. The several dis- 



and workshops 
gave us dozens of ideas 
on improving everything 
from the basic structure 
of student government 
10 motivating others on 
campus to get involved. 

In addition to the 
benefiis directly associ- 
ated ivith the conference, 
the trip was a great op- 
portunity for the officers 
to gel to know each other 
even more and sec the 
nation'scapital. lam sure 
the group that goes next 
year will also gain a lot 
from the experience and 
utilize what is learned 
to help improve IPFW in 
new, different, and excit- 
ing ways. 

I would also like to 
mention that the con- 
ference fees and travel 
expenses were paid for 
out of the Student Senate 
TYavel Fund. Money from 
this fund is available to 
all students looking for 
financial assistance for 
traveling opportunities; 
however certain crite- 
ria must be met in or- 
der to receive funding. 
For more details on this 
one can contact the Vice 
President of Finance Erik 
Shepherd at siuvpf@ipfw. 
edu or the Vice President 
of Legislation Melissa 
Cornish at stuvpl@ipfw. 
edu.

A courageously determined pursuit to interview Ben Folds 



By Mark Cox 



Winston Churchill 
has said. "Success is not 
linal, failure is not fatal: 
it is the courage to con- 
tinue that counts" 

To achieve certain 
goals in life, detcrmi- 
nuiion and courage aro 
some of the biggest fac- 
tors to doing so. Sure. 
failure is prone to hap- 
pening at multiple times 
in anyone's lifetime, but 
does that mean all hope 
is to be given up and no 
willpower should be in- 
vested in our wants or 
biggest dreams? 1 believe 
not, 

Ever since I started 
listening to music at an 
early age 1 had the dream 
of being a rock star. It did 
not occur to me until I got 
my first guitar in middle 
school that I did not pos- 
sess the ability of keeping 
a heal or singing while 
playing guitar, let alone 
the skill to play anything 
besides a simple Blink- 
182 riff— however, that 
did not discourage me 
from a little recreational 
guitar playing. 

Since being a rock star 
is not the easiest thing to 
achieve, 1 decided to set- 
de for meeting a popular 
musician — specifically, 
one that I am fond of. 1 
decided that this was a 
great lime to execute that 
plan since I ivrile for the 
newspaper — so why not 
interview a musician? I 
found my musician; Ben 
Folds. Ben was playing 
at the Embassy Theatre 
here- in -Fbn Wayne. I 
knew from the stan that 
this \\'ould not be an easy 
task. 

In il for the long haul. 



I did some research, not 
knowing how to success- 
fully attain this interview. 
I tried to find any contact 
information to no avail. 
I started the journey at 
Sony BMG Music En- 
tertainment, the parent 
company of Epic Re- 
cords. I was unsure which 
department I had to talk 
lo, so I begun myjoumoy 
of leaving voicemails on 
corporate inboxes and 
sending emails to any- 
one who seemed legit 
enough to get me my in- 
terview. 

A half an hour after 
leaving about four or 
five voicemails, 1 got a 
call from an area code 
in New York — I was so 
nervous I almost missed 



with contact informa- 
tion and a brief explana- 
tion for the publication I 
am involved with. E-mail 
sent. Fastest response I 
have ever given— I was 
so excited. 

Two weeks went by 
and I didn't hear a thing. 
I began to lose interest in 
this interview, and then 
right as my hopes were 
fading. I got an e-mail 
with contact informa- 
tion, I^inally, after two 
weeks, more progress! 
Again, I sent a quick re- 
sponse to my contact 
at Big Hassle Publicity. 
No e-mail. Another two 
weeks went by. 

Discouragement got 
in the way of my deter- 
mination. ! almost gave 




the call on purpose so I 
would only have to listen 
to the voice mail. Pick- 
ing up the phone, I was 
greeted by a publicist for 
Sony BMG and given the 
phone number to an Epic 
Records pubUcisr located 
in Los .\ngeles. Califor- 
nia, to which I responded 
\vith. "Awesomel" 

1 called the num- 
ber and once again got 
a voice mail. The ne-xt 
day I was greeted from a 
phone call from Epic Re- 
cords and was directed 
to send her an e-mail 



up, until i got tired of be- 
ing pushed away from 
what would be one of the 
biggest interviews of my 
life. I found the compa- 
ny's phone number and 
began making my calls. 
Finally after numerous 
attempts, I was directed 
to a publicist named 
Ken. He was a nice guy, 
but quickly I found he 
was not the man I need- 
ed to talk to. He directed 
me to Nicole, who would 
be able to get me exacUy 
what I needed— FINAL- 
LY! She accomplished 



more in my quest to get 
this interview dian any- 
one else I had talked lo. 

It was two days before 
tlie concert and 1 stilt had 
not heard a final answer 
on if I had the interview 
or not. I went around 
asking everyone 1 knew, 
"What would you ask if 
you met one of your fa- 
vorite musicians?" I goi a 
lot of irrelevant interview 
questions, such as "Will 
you have my babies?", 
but it made me realize 
the questions I wanted 
to ask: everything that 
nobody else would think 
toaskhim. Ididnotwani 
the cookie-cutter inter- 
view. 

The day before and 
1 had still heard no re- 
sponse. 1 made four calls 
that day T\vo out of the 
four times, she was "not 
at her desk", which i be- 
lieve was staged so she 
did not have to talk to me 
yet again. 

I never got a call 
back — instead, an email. 
I knew would not be 
good. "I appreciate your 
patience with me on 
this," was the first line 
and my heart dropped. 
"but it doesn't look like 
we're going to be able 
to schedule tius for to- 
morrow... ivith travel and 
other commitments, we 
couldn't make it work 
with Ben's schedule.' 

My hean sank. I did 
not let it get to ma I 
failed: however, I had 
gonen further than most 
people have. I took a 
dream and 1 tried to turn 
it into an epic interview 
that would be the biggest 
interview of my life. But 
hey. now I've got con- 
nections — his tour pub- 
licist hooked me up iviih 
two rickets to the show, 
of which was one of the 



best Ben Folds shows I 
have been to (and free!). 
Sure, he wasn't full band, 
but he blew the Embassy 
away with the help of the 
Fort Wayne Philharmon- 
ic. 

What happens now? 
I suppose, for now, wait- 
ing until the next time 
Ben comes around Fort 
Wayne. As long os you 
have a dream and the de- 
termination 10 achieve 
most people will 



take the time to listen to 
what you have to say For 
me, this isn't a failure — it 
is a success. Althougli 1 
did not actually gel lo 
interview him, I had the 
trip of a lifetime talking 
to big-shot publicists 
who could gel me exactly 
what I needed. Now the 
only thing left is a bunch 
of unanswered questions 
which trouble my mind 
and curiosity.

"How to Succ&lt; 



By Peter Schnellenberger 

SUlfWiilci 



Monte Python. Walt Dis- 
ney's Goofy, and Hairspray 
all come together in "How 
10 Succeed in Business 
without Really Trying," 
which opened Friday, Oct. 
3, 2008 in the Williams 
Theatre. 

'ITie musical, written by 
Willie Gilbert and Jack 
Weinstock, was originally 
produced in 1961 is (he 
staged version of an iden- 
tically titled book, writ- 
ten by Shepherd Mead 
in 1955. The musical is a 
hilarious satire of life in 
Corporate America dur- 
ing the laie 1950s and 
early 60's. 

On the surface the show 
appears to be an 'almost 
cartoon" poking fun at 
well-to-do businessmen 
who are 'willing to do 
whatever it takes to get lo 
the lop." 

According to the direc- 
tor of IPFW's producdon, 
Craig Humphrey, the ac- 
tors' movements and vo- 
calizations are exagger- 
ated like a cartoon would 
be and there is even a

each event, there is a nar- 
ration of what the main 
character, Finch, played 
by senior Brcil Tiibbs, has 
jusi accomplished or is 
.ibout to achieve. 

V\'hich is reminiscent of

climbing the corporate 
ladder. Mark Ridge way, 
the scenic designer, de- 
scribed how he incorpo- 
rated this theme into the 
set itself. He said that he 
*N*3S inspired by actual ar- 
chitecture from building 
interiors during the I960's. 
He used a very 60s color 
scheme, which includes 
blue, orange, a dirt&gt;- off- 



white, and a highlighter 
yetlow-green color, which 
changes under different 
colored lights. But the 
most important iheme 
that college students and 
people of all ages can 
learn from is the idea of a 
brotherhood of men. 

All IPFW shows are stu- 
dent-run productions, 
the students make every- 
thing from costumes to 
scenery. There is even a 
new majors/minors class 
devoted to producing the 
shows, called THTR 168:

On Wednesday Oclo- 
ber 1, 20-year-old Michi- 
gan University college 
student Bryce Mackie in- 
troduced his video dQcu- 
menlary "Eternal High" 
to those assembled in the 
Walb Ballroom with a jo- 
vial and casual attitude. 

The 12 minute vid- 
eo began with Mackie's 
character sitting in a liv- 
ing room, looking angry 
and out of it. His parents 
walk by, saying they are 



goingoul and will be back 
in a few hours. Once they 
leave the house, Mackie 
goes upstairs, closes his 
door and pulls a plastic 
baggy of pills from un- 
derneath his mattress. 
The narrated voice says, 
"There's this sort ofemp- 
tincss," and "What do I 
have to look for^vard lo?" 
as Mackie's character 
takes the first pill. 

A few seconds later, 
a fuzzy drug reaction is 
shown in the form of a 
blurry picture. The cam- 
era follows the character 
into the descent of be- 
coming intoxicated by 
the drugs. As more and 



more pills are consumed, 
the reaction fades. The 
depiction feels very real; 
it is uncensored it's just 
a real look at the journey 
and struggle the charac- 
ter is undergoing. 

After the consump- 
tion of five or so pills, an 
intense reaction occurs. 
While lights flush across 
the screen, the character 
falls to the floor and spills 
a water glass. Mackie 
narrates, indicating the 
coldness in his body felt 
from too many pills. 

Following the vid- 
eo, Mackie talked for a 
few minutes about the 
production of "Eter- 



nal High." ll look him 
six months to make the 
video and when he made 
il, he didn't know he was 
depressed. He also spoke 
of being initially embar- 
rassed by the film be- 
cause it was such a per- 
sonal project. Mackie's 
speech was very enler- 
latning: he talked about 
having his mom fiim Ihe 
final overdose scene and 
how il was awkward. 

On a more serious 
note, Mackie described 
the feeling of depression 
as how a person feels on 
the worst day of their life, 
except it's every single 
day. 



"Unless you havf 
deep depression, you 
have no clue what it's 
like." he said. 

He talked about be- 
ing very good at hiding 
his depression, but also 
gave options for people 
who might be consid- 
ering suicide. Feelings 
of suicide arc a subject 
not many people want 
to openly discuss, but 
Mackie wants to fight 
the stigma of it. using his 
film. 

When asked what a 
person should do if their 
friend shows signs of 
depression, Mackie said 
the best thing to do is, 



"lust listen. Take in what 
they're saying." He said 
il doesn't really help for 
the friend to suggest pos- 
sible solutions to feeling 
sad because it's not that 
simple. 

Cunently, Mackie is 
working on his second 
him, which is about bi- 
polar disorder. So far, 
"Eiemal High" has won 
24 film festival awards. 

If you'd like to talk to 
someone about suicide 
or any other problem 
you may have, feel free 
to stop by Ihe IPFW Per- 
sonal Counseling Center, 
located in Walb Union.

^ DRINHflGAGE 

From Page 1 



Last monih, a peli- 
iJon was passed around 
and "more than 100 col- 
lege presidents signed 
a petition calling for a 
debate on whether the 
minimum legal drinking 
age should be lowered 
from 21 to 18." according 
a September 22nd lour- 
nal Gazette article. 

There are many statis- 
tics and reasons in sup- 
port of this change. First, 
many college presidents 
feet it would decrease the 
number of 18 to 20 year 
olds drinking on campus 
because it wouldn't be 
such a "badge of rebel- 
lit&gt;n against authority" 
as Ruth Engs, an Indi- 
ana University professor 
wrote in a research paper 
on the subject. 

Lowcringthe drinking 
age to 18 may also lower 
the number of under 21 
binge drinkers. "Those 
under the age of 21 are 
more likely to be heavy 
drinkprs. For example, 
22% ofail students under 
21 compared to 18% over 
21 years of age are heavy 
drinkers." Engs found. 

"Our experience as 
college and university' 



presidents convinces us 
that 21 is not working. 
A culture of dangerous, 
ctandestine'binge-drink- 
ing'-oFten conducted off 
campus has developed," 
says a statement present- 
ed by the petitioning col- 
lege presidents who are 
in favor of a such a law. 

If the age was low- 
ered, alcohol consimip- 
tion among 18 to 20 year 



highways from stales if 
they didn't change their 
drinking age to 21. Since 
states could not afford to 
lose state appropriated 
money, they soon moved 
up their drinking age. 

There are many ways 
in which state govern- 
ments could change 
their drinking age to 18 
and still keep tabs on 
consumption by college 



"If the age was lowered, alcohol 
consumption among 18 to 20 year 
olds In college would be more con- 
trolled and not so secretive." 



olds in college would be 
more controlled and not 
so secretive. 

Another point is that 
the drinking age hasn't 
always been 21. The 
Ronald Reagan adminis- 
tration would be respon- 
sible for bullying states 
to change their drink- 
ing laws in the 1980s, 
Threatening to lake away 
money for the repair of 



students. For example, 
many states have already 
proposed interesting 
bills. "A Minnesota bill 
would allow anyone IS 
and older to buy alcohol 
in bars or restaurants, but 
not in liquor stores until 
they're 21." according to 
a USA Today article. 

The Minnesota bill 
is definitely restricted, 
although it is a decent 



compromise. While a 
percentage of college stu- 
dents focus their week- 
ends on drinking, not 
every student would like 
the drinking age lowered 
just so they can go out 
and get drunk. For some 
students, the ability to 
just be able to get into 
a bar or club with older 
friends, whether they 
drink or not, is worth the 
battle to lower the age re- 
striction. 

There are many peti- 
tions online available for 
students to sign, in favor 
of the drinking age be- 
ing changed to 18, Also, 
Campus Ministry will be 
hosting a panel discus- 
sion endded'Alcohol and 
the College Campus: Can 
the TVvo Mix Responsi- 
bly?" on Thursday, Octo- 
ber 9. noon to 1:15 p.m. 
in Walb 222. Ben Gates, 
Directorof Campus Min- 
istry believes this forum 
is relevant now because 
this month is Depression^ 
Awareness Month anf '" 
that depression could 
lead to an alcohol addic- 
tion. Additionally, Gates 
said, "Drinking is huge 
problem on college cam- 




puses." Students 
attending the fo- 
rum on Thursday 
will have the op- 
portunity to hear 
fiom professional 
counselors and

the issue and 
gain more infor- 
mation. Gates 
said students 
will hear, 
"a more

subject.

Useful Web Apps 

for students 



By Craig Lloyd 

Writer 



As a college student, 1 
want to use the best tools 
to do my research and 
have the right resources 
to make life easier when 
it comes to \vriting a te- 
dious paper or finishing 
a math assignment. 

I have come across 
some pretty cool web 
applications the past 
couple of years and even 
recendy that have saved 
me hours of work. These 
are quick, easy to use and 
even free of charge. 

- www.BibMe.org is 
a free service that takes 
the pain out of creating a 
bibhogiaphy. Search for a 
book, article, website, or 
him and it will automati- 
cally 611 in the informa- 
tion that it can find. You 
can also enter the infor- 
manon in yourself. Next, 
add it to your bibliogra- 
phy, then download your 
bibhography in either 
MLA or APA format and 



include it in your paper. 
Poof Done. You can also 
tryivww.EasyBib.com. 

■ With many due 
dates For assignments, I 
like to keep a virtual cal- 
endar handy with all im- 
portant dates recorded. 
There are a lot of great 
online calendars out 
there, but my favorite is 
Google Calendav, simply 
because it is easy to use 
and it integrates nicely 
with Gmail. You can also 
make separate categories 
for work schedules and 
miscellaneous events 
and color code each. Last 
but not least, you can 
share your calendar wilh 
your friends. For all you 
Facebook addicts, a good 
calendar application is 
30 boxes. 

- Tired of drawing 
crooked and uneven 
graphs in math class? 
Fear not. for there is a 
quick solution. Printable- 
Paper.net has all sorts of 
different templates you 
can easily print out for 
free. They have graph 
paper, financial paper, 
music paper, dotted pa- 
per, legal paper, and even 



bowling score sheets. 

- Word processors, 
spreadsheets, and pre- 
sentation apps are prob- 
ably the single most often 
used tool among stu- 
dents. While none of the 
online office suites like 
Google Docs can beat 
Microsoft Office (for stu- 
dents, it only costs $27 at 
the bookstore), they have 
some advantages. While 
Office obviously has a lot 
more features, Google 
Docs is free and it allows 
easier sharing of docu- 
menLs and working on 
projects collaboratively. 

- Did I mention the 
Google search engine? It 
really is the killer research 
tool. You can do simple 
math, currency and unit 
conversions, get answers 
to questions like 'What's 
the population of Indo- 
nesia?" (it is 234.693,997, 
by the way), search the 
text of books, find defini- 
tions and synonyms, and 
of course, search the web. 
You can do all this and a 
ton more ri^t from the 
search bar.

school 5K record previously held by Mastodon stand- 
out Ashley Ritchey (17:56).

freshman, who seem to be rounding into form as the 
'Dons prepare for the season-ending Summit League

After a long and grueling weekend, women's tennis 
coach Eric Burns provided these thoughts of the 
team's effort from the Mastodon Invitational. 

"We had good results this weekend. I'm really proud 
of Y'uka and Agnes, ihey played great. Agnes has now 
won back to back weekends and has won seven 
straight singles matches so she is on a roll. 1 feel we 
could have played a litde bener in doubles as we were 
in a great position to have really good results, but we 
didn't close out games very well- Everyone played

Hartley-Hutton surpasses 
200 wins against SDSU 



By Dan Vance 

When a successful 2007 season 
ended, women's volleyball coach Kelly 
Harlley-Hulton sal just seven wins 
away from reaching the 200 ivin mark 
for her short, but historic IPFW career. 

She probably never envisioned that it 
would lake her 15 more matches lo get 
there. But even through the struggles of 
Invitational season when 2008 began. 
Harilcy-Hutlon reached the mark 
on the final day of September with 
an impressive five-game victory over 
visiting Wright Slate. 

She surpassed that mark a few days 
later with a sweep of South Dakota 
Slate for win 201, 

The Mastodons seemed primed to 
give her the win early in the contest, 
getting up 2-0 on the visiting Raiders 
in impressive fashion before dropping 
close games three and four. IPFW 
rallied back and won the deciding 
game 15-10. 

Hartley-Hutton graduated from the 
University of Toledo in 1991 after four 
slrongyearsivith the Rocket's volleyball 
program. She earned an M.S. from 
Bowling Green State in 1993 before 
coaching came her way in 1994. 

Al Walsh University of the NAIA, 
llarlley-Hutlon won 131 matches on 
her way to back-to-back Mid-Ohio 
Conference lilies. Four years into 
her slay with Walsh, the Division I 
level came calling as Hartley-Huiion 
speni one season with Robert Morris 
University, finishing 6-23. 

Then came IPFW and she broughi the

change die school was looking for. 

An ever emerging powerhouse in 
men's volleyball, the women's leam 
was no slouch but needed a devoted 
leader much like the men had in coach 
Arnie Ball. 

Hartley-Hutton made that imediate 
impact, placing second in the Great 
Lakes Valley Conference in 1999 and 
tying for first in the GVLC in 2000 before 
the Mastodons became a Division I 
program. 

Struggling to a below .500 record each 
of her two years wilh the Mastodons, 
something began to click and the 
leam reeled off four slraight 20-win 
seasons as an Independent, including 
an Independent National Title in 2006, 
Three of the team's sbc years os an 
Independent program saw Hartley- 
Hutton named Independent Coach of 
the Year three times.

Tin Caps? Well, it could be worse. 

In All Directions I Op-Ed tfv 



By Dan Vance 

vdnte-i&lt;i&lt;J.blagspol.c( 



Fan Wayne has yet another new 
mascot. Gone arc the longstanding 
Wizards tor the Dragons as their logo 
has suggested now for years) and in 
it's place are the Tin Caps. 

Wail?Thc Tin Caps? Really? 

And the logo. It's a semi-angry apple 
with a pul on it's head. Wail, we are 
ihePol I leads? Oh hell. 

Whoever thought this one up must be a genius, 
because there would never be a chance thai anyone 
would lake the name and turn it around in such a 
negative manner (please, note the sarcasm.) 

However, drug references aside. I can't really 
condemn our new Minor League Baseball team's 
moniker. After all, does anybody remember how 
much ihecitizensofFortWayne despised the name 
Wizards when It came about in 1993? 

'Amazing baseball" and all aside, most people 
here actually wanted us to be called the Fon Wayne 
IWins, due to our Ihen-aftiliation with the Major 
l.cague Minnesota variety. 

No accounting for taste there. 

The Tin Capsdocscapture two things that I diink 
are very imponant when naming teams in the 
present days of terrible sporting names: 

1) His different. It's not die Bobcats or Warriors or 
i'anlhers or somelhing that any other professional 
team or school has. 

2) It is localized. The logo points out things that 
the name doesn't. Referring to ihc tin pot that the 
fabled (ohnny Appleseed supposedly wore on his 
head, the learn had an interesling play on one of 
Fort Wayne's more legendary persons of lore. 




If you like the name Mad Ants, of the one-year 
old NBA Developmental League, then you cannoi 
in any good failh dislike Tin Caps. 

When leff Potter and the crew over with the Mad 
Ants came up with the name, they used the same 
formula. They took famed General Anthony Wayne, 
twisted the Anthony pari up and there you have it; 
angry ants. 

And it fits in well with not only the Mad Anis. 
but Fort Wayne's only other really focused on 
professional team the Komeis. Komeis with a 'K? 
That's preity much jusi a Fon Wayne thing. 

Tin Caps is oriented specifically to this city. Or 
for all you old school Wizards haters, we could call 
ourselves the Fon Wayne Padres! 

Or you could shut up. 

We could be boring and cliche with usual names 
or ones thai siarl with a 'F' For pathetic rhyming 
purposes (Flash? Fever? Defunct Freedom?). Or we 
could break out as we have done. 

So me, I will accept the Tm Caps. 

Why wouldn't 1? Why wouldn't anyone. 

After all, we siill have this brand new, Tom Henry- 
rific, financially irresponsible stadium to complain 
about. 





5. Colorado 14ers 

N8A Developmental leaQue 
1i simply makes NO sense. The 
name, based onihc height of the 
Rock&gt;' Mounluins, Icuves inuih lo he 
desired. At least their NRDL foe the 
lulsa 66er5 have a logo lo somewhat 
clarify' a poor name. 

4. Fighting Christians 

Elon Univeisity (through 19991 

At least they changed it to the 

Pheonix. The school's former 

monikerwas kind of couniei 

productive for a school of faith. 

3. Gorlocks 

Webitet University 
Oumb mascots are one thing, Fake 
ones are on a whole different (and 
low) level. Webster claims it as a 
mythological creature, but it is still a 
made up mythological creanirc. And 
an ugly one at that. 

2. Anteaters ^^ 

Univetsiiyof California-l^^(lne 

Unless this college is in 

Fort Wayne to play our NBDI. 

team, I'm nut so sure that an AnieateFTs something 

to be worried about, no matter how many muscles 

the logo has. 

i. Berries 

Logansport (IN) High School 

The worst sporting name ever seen. 

It's bad on many levels, but throw in the 

mascot (canoon Felix the Cat?) and the 

Berries are the runaway losers.
