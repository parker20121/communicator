Internet requires funding options 



By S. Brant Kelley 
SUIT Writer 

Accessing an ouLside computer system 
may soon be easier if IPFW laps into the 
Internet communication system. Internet is 
a computer communication network 
designed for one computer's user to be able 
to access another computer's database. 

IPSGA President Mark King plans for 
IPFW to become part of the network some- 
time in the next two months. He will give a 
proposal to the University Resources Policy 
Committee (URPC), which will endorse or 
reject the proposal. After the URPC makes 
its decision, (he proposal will go to the 
Information Steering Technology 
Commission, which will recommend 



approval or disapproval by IPFW 
Chancellor Michael Wanell. 

King first became interested in bringing 
Internet to the campus two years ago when 
be was a student senator. A couple months 
ago, two students from an unnamed student 
organization pushed for installation of 
Internet, and King pursued the possibility. 

If Internet were installed, King said 
IPSGA would absorb the cost of gelling 
started, which would be between $25,000 
and $30,000. The cost of maintenance and 
upkeep could be defrayed in any one of four 
ways: 

1.) The University could absorb the cost; 
the University itself would need to find the 
money somewhere. This could lead to the 
reduction or elimination of other services to 



the students or to increased tuition and fees. 
2.) A technology fee could be levied on the 
students by IPSGA. King said this is the 
least desirable option because the Purdue 
University trustees board must approve 
such an action and the board would exercise 
control over the fees. 
3) IPSGA absorbs the cost by either 

a.) returning student/athletic department 
division of student service fees to 50/50. 
King said this is the most desirable option. 

b.) taking funds out of the student ser- 
vices fees pool before i( is divided between 
student organizations and the athletic 
department. King staled this is the most 
likely option. 
4.) Raising student activities fees. 

Once in place, the Internet system would 



be operated by Computing and Data 
Processing, and would be controlled by 
IPSGA. King said. The system would 
access off-campus computers via Telnet, 
through which someone can tap into anoth- 
er database and download data. 

Another popular medium would be E- 
mail, which is already available to faculty. 
Fifty-four percent of students polled said 
they would use E-mail. 

The immediate question is whether or 
not the student body would get S30.000 of 
use from Internet, Some of the benefits 
would be instant access to other libraries' or 
universities' information, and ease of access 
to anyplace in the world. 

Another advantage (o Internet would be 
ease of access. During the fall 1993 semes- 



ter, at least one class was conducted partial- 
ly over the campus computer network. 
Many of ihe students who responded nega- 
tively lo ihls cited full or incompatible 
schedules as a problem to using a computer 
network Many work off-campus and/or 
raise families in addition lo taking classes. 
The Internet would be more accessible on 
campus. 

If the students were to use the system, 
they would need to be adequately Intro- 
duced to it. In a IPSGA-conducted survey, 
several students indicated that familiariza- 
tion with the system was inadequate. Sixty- 
four percent of all students said they didn't 
know about or understand Internet. 
Another 26 percent said they wouldn't use 
il if it was available.

IPFW students, professors 
challenge studio lab fees 



Administrators emphasize 
multicultural concerns 



By F. Lane Douse 
News Editor 

Bettye J. Poignard. director of 
Multicultural Services, welcomed 
African American and Hispanic stu- 
dents to the campus in an orienta- 
tion sponsored by her office. 

Poignard introduced the various 
administrators ranging from the 
Chancellor to the Dean of Students. 

Michael A. Wanell. chancellor of 
IPFW, welcome the student and 
spoke on the importance of diversity. 

"We're pleased to have you 
here," Wanell said. "When we look 
at a university, we like to talk about 
diversity. Ethnic diversity on this 
campus should not only be tolerated 
but welcomed." 

Interim Vice-Chancellor of 
Academic Affairs Fred Kirchhoff 
emphasized the importance of stu- 
dents developing an open line of 
communication with their profes- 
sors and how students of color can 
teach others about diversity through 
their experiences. 

"I think thai diversity is a part of 
education that we're trying lo give 
our students," Kirchhoff comment- 
ed, "and the fact that IPFW does 
Dot have a large body of students of 
color and other ethnic backgrounds 
makes it harder for us to give that 
type of education." 



Kirchhoff also reiterated that Ihe 
faculty is here for the students and 
ihey need to take advantage of that. 

Frank Borelli. vice chancellor of 
Student Affairs gave a brief speech 
about the components and function 
of his area. 

Borelli also encouraged students 
to solicit help when hassled or treat- 
ed unfairly because the "buck 
stops" there. 

"We certainly don't want anyone 
walking away from IPFW unhap- 
py," Borelli said. 

Mara a Y. Tapp-Sanders, direc- 
tor of the F.A.S.T. (Future 
Academic Scholars Track) 
Program, spoke about leadership 
training opportunities for students 
of color on campus. 

Paulina A, Salvador, 
adviser/coordinator of Hispanic stu- 
dents, and Timothy L. Lake, advis- 
er/coordinator of African- American 
students, individually spoke about 
Ihe community outreach programs 
and student-oriented programs that 
come out of the office of 
Multicultural Services. 

Yvene Williams, president of the 
Black Collegian Caucus, and 
JoAnne Tarango, president of 
Hispanos Unidos. both presented 
their respective groups and some of 
the activities planned for [be 
upcoming year.

The battle to abolish the fine 
arts studio lab fee has been one 
Leslie Molz, associate professor 
and acting chair of fine arts, has 
fighting since (he Fort Wayne 
Institute of An merged with IPFW 
in 1976. 

"I think they are aware that this 
is probably an unfair assessment," 
said Molz. "And I think tbey 
would like to do something about 
it but, because of the decrease in 
funding from state appropriations, 
the elimination of the lab fees is 
unrealistic." 

According to Vice Chancellor 
of Financial Affairs Walt Branson, 
the money from all of the lab fees 
goes into tbe general fund 

The general fund consists of 
monies from several sources such 
as the student lab fees, state 
appropriations, investment, over- 
head and miscellaneous funding. 

"These are the funds we have 
available to run the core missions 
of the university," Branson said. 

Before the Fort Wayne Institute 
of An merged with IPFW. Molz 
calculated a materials fee for stu- 
dents who took classes in which 
they were supplied with materials 
to use in class. 

At the time of the merger, the 
financial officer did not want to 
bill students separately, so a Hat 
fee was implemented 

Currently, IPFW students tak- 
ing fine arts classes ore charged 



approximately twenty-five dollars 
per credit hour. For instance, a 
student taking a three-credit hour 
class will pay about seventy-five 
dollars in lab fees for that one 
class. 

"They think it's a materials fee, 
but on the firsl day of class our 
instructors hand out a list of mate- 
rials that ihe students need." Motz 
commented. "They go out to buy 
the materials, and I'm here to tell 
you the price for supplies is hor- 
rendous." 

Motz estimated that basic male- 
rials can cost hundreds of dollars. 

Along with the cut in funding 
from the state appropriations 
board, Motz has also had to deal 
with running his department while 
short two staff members, decreas- 
ing the offering of service classes 
such as art history or an apprecia- 
tion, and the reorganization of fac- 
ulty and canceling of several 
classes. 

Even though the department is 
effected tremendously by Ihe 
financial situation of the universi- 
ty, enrollment has increased. 

"As enrollment goes up, I'm 
generating more credit hours. I'm 
generating more of that fee money 
going into the general fund but, 
proportionately. I'm not getting 
any more." Motz said. 

Branson stated that is there is 
no way to determine what specific 
area tne money comes trom in 
terms of funding a department. 

Branson also said that the dean 
of the school has the flexibility lo 



adjust the budget, but rarely 
enforces this control. 

Gerald Lee Ratliff. dean of the 
School of Fine and Performing 
Arts, understand the financial silu- 
ation on campus. 

"This is something thai is 
affecting all of us," said Ralliff. 
"And we're taking the appropriate 
steps lo handle the problem." 

According to Ratliff, there has 
been some discussion of solutions 
to this problem, such as eliminat- 
ing ihe lab fee. 

Ralliff has worked on several 
campuses in which the lab fee 
remained with the department, but 
there was little or no effect 
because of the cost of materials. 

Molz feels thai a portion of 
money would help the department 
significantly, Recalling ihree years 
ago as tbey began to move into the 
new fine arts building, the vice- 
chancellor of financial affairs allo- 
cated a portion of money to his 
deportment, which allowed him to 
purchase materials for the depart- 
ment. 

As for student reactions, Motz 
feels the students are not content 
with the lab fee. 

"They don't like it," Motz said. 
"They complain but are reluctant 
to act. They just want to go and do 
their thing, which is art." 

Hopefully, fine arls students 
may find a ray of hope in tbe 
tuture. Bui tor now, "You are seg- 
regating and you are penalizing 
students for taking fine arts class- 
es," Motz said.

Effective as of the '94-'95 
semester, students will no longer 
see the Campus Calendar in The 
Communicaior. 

In a recent student government 
meeting, Student Senator and Chair 
of Legislative Affairs Chris Douse 
questioned Mark King, student 
body president, concerning cutting 
the Campus Calendar out of The 
Communicator. 

After the meeting. The 
Communicaior received an E-mail 
memo, which stated: 

"I do not feel that it is a govern- 
ments (sic) job to advertise on 
going (sic) events. It should be 
either a papers (sic) job to let the 
community know what is happen- 
ing or it should be the people orga- 
nizing the events to get the message 
oul I feel that we put enough in the 
paper and advertising is a waste of 
even more money. Perhaps if we 



got a belter rate then 1 could sec 
doing it. If you all have a problem 
with this let me know," said King. 

However, in the student govern- 
ment meeting, Douse told King that 
student government docs indeed 
receive a student rate discount- 
King decided not lo advertise 
the Campus Calendar in The 
Communicator, stating tbe only 
advertisements that the student gov- 
ernment will pay for in the future 
are the Indiana-Purdue Student 
Government Association (IPSGA) 
elections and special cases. 

Others have questioned whether 
King should have taken such action 
without the political backing of the 
senate. 

"It may seem like a minor deci- 
sion on his pan, but ii's something 
thai is relevant and does affect 
many of the students thai look to 
the calendar as a source of informa- 
tion," said IPFW student Juanita 
Alvarez. 

King also expressed lhai the cal-

endar did not warrant its cost and 
there were not enough events spon- 
sored by student government to jus- 
tify the amount spent 

"It is blatant disregard to the 



student body's opinion on 
whether they want the Campus 
Calendar. continuing this type 
of action is not democratic," 
said Douse.

Gay community must 

play by the rules differently 



By Paul Tupper 
SUIT Columnist 

During Ihe pasi scmesicr 
months, there has been a lot of 
talk aboul ihc "gay agenda." This 
is supposed to reflect what we as 
homosexuals would like lo see 
happen in the form of change. 
Now, 1 was never asked to fill oui 
any survey lo help decide whai 
homosexuals want; so instead. 1 
ihoughl I would use this article lo 
publicize what it is thai 1 would 
like to see happen. 1 speak only 
for myself and do nol represent 
the entire gay community. 

First. I wani (o know that I 
have been turned down for a pro- 
motion simply because Becky 
deserved it more than mc and 
would be the best person for iL I 
do nol think that being gay should 
ruin my chances al a position. 1 
also do nol believe that 1 should 



be given a job because 1 am gay. 
In ihe work force, I simply want 
what I have earned 

Second. I want io be able lo 
show my affection for my lover 
in public because it is the natural 
thing to do. nol lo show off or 
gross out any narrow-minded het- 
erosexual. If 1 am nol allowed lo 
do so. then I want public affec- 
tion outlawed for everyone (from 
holding bands to kissing). If I 
can't do it, neither should hetero- 
sexuals. 

Third, I want to be legally 
married lo that one special per- 
son. Contrary to popular belief, 
many homosexuals want io be 
monogamous. Now. some may 
argue that gays can still be 
monogamous without being 
legally united. Bul what about all 
of the other plenties thai hetero- 
sexuals benefit from, like health 
insurance. Here's a perfect exam- 



ple: two of my closest friends. 
Ted and Jesse, are committing to 
each other and would like lo have 
a ceremony to celebrate Ibis with 
all of Ihcir friends However. Ted 
is currently unemployed due (o 
just having graduated college and 
does not have any medical cover- 
age. Heterosexuals could put their 
spouses on their plan, but Jesse 
cannot. 

I also want to adopt a child in 
the future. After all. children 
make a family. Although we have 
seen some progression on this 
subject, it is still very difficult for 
same sex couples to adopt. 

Now. after reading this, docs il 
seem like I want much? You can 
see thai I want nothing more than 
what heterosexuals already bene- 
fit from And let me make this 
Uiii.it If I don't gel what I want, 
I, along with an army of a few 
million, will figbl for il. 



Headlines will continue lo report 
the shootings and homicides until 
our entire community accepts 
responsibility for all of ils cilizens. 
It lakes a collective will which we 
are desperately seeking, but have 
yet to find. Thai can be the only 
explanation for so much violence 
and so little outrage.

him. Mis reasoning for acting irra- 
tionally was based on the fact he 
could no longer handle the racism 
in America â€” a concept I can under- 
stand myself because I've had that 
same amount of rage. However, 
instead of participating in self- 
destructive behavior. I focused the 
rage into my writings. 

Anyway, Ferguson's lawyers 
have labeled bis actions as an 
expression of Black Rage. Similar 
to the battered woman's syndrome. 
Black Rage is a mental condition in 
which African-Americans have 



reached their breaking point after 
accumulating a tremendous amount 
of anger from having to exist and 
survive in a racist society. 

However, I don't feel that this 
can be the only operational defini- 
tion of Black Rage because this one 
deals specifically with violent 
actions. 

Whal about the rage African- 
Americans feel because of their 
lack of identity? For instance, I'm 
currently taking Y200: A Survey of 
African-Americans. Slowly, but 
surely, I am dealing wilh the anger 
that is slowly building inside me. 

One may ask, why am I begin- 
ning to get angry? 

It angers me that I am only now 
learning aboul my African ancestry 
in a college course because of the 
fact thai this information was lost 
due to our assimilation into white 
European culture 

I think it's important that while 
folks understand this rage. It is the 
rage we feel because we are unable 
lo determine our own heritage, and 
cannoi be completely expressed for 
several reasons. 

First, African -Americans have

been psychologically raped of 
their identity, and there is no com- 
pensation thai can heal the separa- 
tion of Africans and African- 
Americans. 

Secondly, one must look at the 
continued social injustice that hap- 
pens to people of color, particularly 
African -Americans or people with 
African descent in this country and 
globally. Examples of what I'm 
talking about are the Rodney King 



incident, the LA. nots. and the OJ. 
Simpson trial. 

It took two trials for the "just 
us" system to determine that the 
four white police officers of the 
Los Angeles Police Department 
violated Rodney King's so-called 
unalienable rights as a citizen of 
this country. 

The outrage injustice in the "just 
us" system was expressed through 
the LA, riots in which African- 



Americans destroyed portions of 
the city. And I must not forget the 
current number one program on 
television, the State vs. O.J. 
Simpson We're all sick of this 
Amerikan tragedy. 

In the article printed earlier this 
year, 1 said. "It actually fell good lo 
finally see the tables turn, for white 
folks to actually see and feel what 
African Americans go through on a 
day-to-day basis. I'm not talking 



aboul the munlcr in particular, I'm 
talking aboul ihe lack of respect for 
lTk Iim&gt; hi \ mean- American peo- 
ple..." 

I will always stand by ihis state- 
ment Whuc (oik will never have a 
sense of what African-American 
people feel in their daily lives in 
Amcnka; they will never under- 
stand ihe effect of race in ihis coun- 
try; and they will never understand 
black rage.

IPFW grad student publishes murder mystery series 



By JoArnSUinrorth 
Feature* Editor 

David N, Benson knows the 
makings of a good murder mystery 
when ii comes his way. 

Benson, chief copy editor for ihe 
Evening Slar in Auburn and occa- 
sional production manager for The 
Communicator, has had several of 
his short stories published. 

One such short story, "Gay 
Lover's Lethal Plot against Sue 
Ellen" was published earlier this year 

Movie Review 



by Pinnacle Publishing This article 
was part of an anthology of murder 
stories compiled for "Hitman." 

The story line was derived from 
an actual murder case in 
Washtenaw County, near Ann 
Arbor, Mich. When be started writ- 
ing this story, he was living in 
Coldwater, Mich. In June 1993, he 
read an article in the Detroit Free 
Press about the murder case. 

According to Benson, the case 
focuses on a moderately successful 
married real estate executive, Bill 



Curtis, who has a male lover on the 
side. The two lovers plot the murder 
of Bill's wife. Sue Ellen. 

The actual murder took place on 
April 1, 1991, and the businessman 
was convicted in early 1992. 

"The case took longer to com- 
plete than what I had planned," said 
Benson. 

Benson says he didn't get much 
cooperation from law enforcement 
officials in Michigan. While 
working full time at his present 
job, Benson continued to write 



sporadically about the murder tri- 
angle. 

Benson then researched a news- 
paper clipping file for Ann Arbor 
and found out wbo bandied the case 
and went to the court house He 
bought a 200-page court transcript 
for 50 cents a page. 

Finally, one law enforcement 
official agreed to talk to him. as 
long as his name was not used. 

Curtis was acquitted of the first- 
degree murder charge, but was con- 
victed of felony murder and two 



counts each of armed robbery, con- 
spiracy to commit armed robbery, 
and the use of a firearm in the com- 
mission of a felony 

Benson's current project is a 
story about slain IPFW student. 
Paul Rosctti. who was murdered in 



the Fall 1993. 

Benson graduated from IPFW in 
Political Science, and is currendy 
working on his graduate degree in 
SPEA

Flick depicts lovers' killing spree 



By Jamie Craver 
Staff Writer 

Imagery. This one word best 
describes what makes 'Natural 
Born Killers' so powerful. The 
movie has a storyline that provokes 
our interest but is chopped into 
jagged pieces by a collage of 
ioiagcry that lures the viewers' 
minds much deeper into the movies 
chaos. 

I The movie starts off with 
Mickey and Mallory Knox, a pair of 
serial killers played effectively by 
Woody Harrclson and Juliette 
Lewis, who stop for a bite at a 
truck stop. The loving couple bru- 
tally murder everyone in the diner 
except for one man, leaving him to 
describe the massacre to the author- 
ities. From this point on, the car- 
nage never really slows down. 

Abrupt, blaek-and while images 
allow (he audience to look into the 
demented minds of the film's char- 
ters. But Mickey and Mallory arc 
l ihe only ones portrayed as 
isted in the movie; the main 
investigator hot on their trail, the 
warden of the jail, and media 
celebrities all show flashes of their 
own sick and selfish thoughts. 

Oliver Stone directed the film 
and takes a lot of shots at the police 



and the media throughout Ihe 
movie The warden (Tommy Lee 
Jones) of the prison in which the 
duo are eventually incarcerated dis- 
plays uncaring and violent over- 
tones, while the Australian host of 
the hit television series 'American 
Maniacs' (played humorously by 
Robot Downey, Jr.) is reminiscent 
of tabloid king Geraldo. The show 
itself is very similar to an episode 
of 'America's Most Wanted' or 'A 
Current Affair'. 

'American Maniacs,' which 
makes modem folk heroes out of 
the sadistic and murderous couple. 
is an ironic takeoff on the sen- 
satonalistic nature of American 
news programs and talk shows. 

Oliver Stone also mixes in a lot 
of black humor in the movie. In 
one scene, Mickey and Mallory 
are on a bridge clasping their 
bloody hands together, which (hey 
had just split open with a large 
knife, and arc exchanging wedding 
vows. A car of noisy people drive 
by and Mickey glares at the pass- 
ing car and simply says, "I ain't 
gonna kill no one durin' our wed- 
din* ." 

As the blood drips from their 
entwined palms down to the river 
below, Stone uses some unique ani- 
mation that draws out a lot of sym- 



Snoiirin 




bolism that the other images just 
cannot capture. 

Continuously throughout the 
movie, you are also shown images 
of death â€” cows and bleeding peo- 
ple who are in the process of dying. 

Mickey and Mallory many times 
look at individuals with whom they 
come in contact with and envision 
Ihe person as they would look â€” 
bloody and mutilated. This gives 
the viewer insight to the sick 
images that are given birth inside 
the minds of sadistic couple. 

During the movie, you can see a 
demented but strong bond of love 
between Mickey and Mallory. You 
also can see the sad reason for their 
troubled minds in clips which show 
the violent and sexually abusive 
family problems in their respective 
pasts. 

Eventually, the pair are cap- 
tured and separated. Morton 
Downey Jr.'s character immedi- 
ately sets up an exclusive live 
interview with Mickey Knox. 
During the interview, Knox gives 
a speech that is so compelling you 
almost believe that he is a natural 
born killer, born to be a predator 
like any other wild animal in 
nature. He speaks to the world Ihe 
revelations of a madman â€” how he 
knows only his love for Mallory 
can defeat their demons and that a 
moment's realization of truth is 
worth a thousand prayers. 

The fellow prisoners, watching 
Ihe eveni live on television, are 
inspired by the speech and start a 
huge riot which enables Mickey 
and Mallory to reunite and escape. 
The scene is absolutely chaotic 
and displays gruesome scenes 
such as a bloody guard tied lo a

Q: Is it true the HIV

health officials are no 
longer sure that you can't 
get HIV through "low 
risk" body fluids like 
sweat and tears? 

A: Yes, the HIV virus is 
mutating; that's why it's so 
difficult to develop a 
vaccine. However, since the 
virus was identified 1 years 
ago, it's been known to 
mutate rapidly. There is still 
no evidence that you can 
contract it through fluids 
such as sweat and tears.

By Jo Ann Steinforth 
News Editor 

On Sunday, Aug. 28, about 70 
actors showed up at Williams 
Theater from 1:30 to 4:30 p m for 
the fall tick -off with hope of land- 
ing a role in one of eight plays to 
be held during IPFW's 1994-95 
theater season. 

This year, all of the season's 
plays were cast in one afternoon. 

A behind- the-scenes look 

Most theater patrons see only 
the "finished product" on opening 
night, but very few people realize 
what goes on behind the scenes to 
get ready for opening nigbL 

Auditioning for a play or musi- 
cal can be a nerve-wracking experi- 
ence. Open "cattle calls" can take 
up to two-three hours. Actors arc 
given scripts to rehearse. 

After what seems like an eterni- 
ty, a name is called. The butterflies 
that have been dancing on your 
stomach for the past few hours now 
leave, and ihe production manager 
leads the way into the empty the- 
ater. 

As each actor enters the dark- 
ened theater, they are instructed to 
meet the three directors who are 
casting the plays "The Baltimore 
Waltz" and "Keely and Du." Brief 
introductions arc made, and the 
actors proceed with their auditions. 

With the clock ticking away and 
with just an hour left to go, the 
directors feel a sense of urgency â€” 
they want to wrap up the day. They 
instruct the stage manager to bring 
in the next group. 



gruesome and dark tale and, instead, 
go see 'The Lion King'. 



4\. 



Now. here is a job thai should be 
"knighted for sainthood." The job 
of stage manager is similar to that 
of an air traffic controller at O' Hare 
Airport during rush hour. 

Knowing who has already 
"read," who needs to come back, 
who has what script who is paired 
with who. etc.. is difficult. This job, 
far away from the spotlights and 
opening night, has leagues of 
responsibility â€” and none of the 
glory. 

About 100 people showed up for 
the party after the auditions. The 
band Freak Mama Jama played. 

According to Larry Life, chair 
of the theater department, all roles 
arc now cast and are posted in the 
theater department. 

Production rehearsals begin 

Rehearsals began the week of 
August 29 for "The Baltimore 
Walt2"and 'Pippin" 

Students who sign up as ushers 
for a play may see the production at 
no cost. An usher sign-up sheet will 
be available in Williams Theater

ets to the performances at Ihe

Free tutoring available to IPFW athletes 



By Eric Butler 
Sports Editor 

Summer is a distant memory and 
school days are back. It's some- 
limes a struggle for sludenis to gel 
back into the swing of things when 
their priorities aren'i exactly clear. 
Student athletes have to juggle 
practice, homework, and a job on 
the side. Freshmen athletes arc also 
forced to adapt to the unfamiliar 
college life. 

Although it might not always 
seem like It, IPFW acknowledges 
your burden. Free tutoring for all 
IPFW students is available. 

Students of IPFW have many 



and varied responsibilities. 
Sometimes its very difficult to 
divide atteniion accordingly. 
Thai's where the tutoring comes in 
because education should be a top 
priority. 

According to Martha Weiherford 
of Transitional Studies, all students 
interested in taking advantage of 
the free tutoring available to them 
must first Fill out an application in 
the Transitional Studies office 
located in KT202. The tutors are 
students who have passed the 
course they are tutoring with a B or 
belter. The program offers two free 
hours of tutoring per subject, per 
week. Students may schedule 



appointments for day or evening 

hours.
