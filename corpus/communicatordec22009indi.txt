Darkness Falls Over Black Friday 

OpEd"^ 



By Kelly McUndon 



In 11 world when- ciiizens will lull 
people jiisl lo «ve SIOO on a laplop, 
there muni bv a problem. If you recall, 
la^l year a wnrlccr at Wal-Mart was 
iramplcd by ihou.tands of people 
rushing through the doors. Those 
chenp laptops and door-biuiers must 
hiivc been important enough to take 
the place of someone's life. 

locally, people waited in lini; for 
Best Buy starting on Thanksgiving 
Uny; others stood in line at Target for 
two hours early the next morning just 
to tnke advantage of S3.99 [IVD deals. 
Bui overiiii, nobody really purchased 
anything iht-y simply could not live 
without. If squeezing through the aisles 
of a store and possibly being stomped 
to dciith is a person's idea of fun. well 
(hen maybe. 

in reality, most of stores are going 
to have good deals during the entire 
monih of December. Maybe not as low 
as they were in Black Friday, bui money 
\vlil still be saved and maybe lives will 



be a 



icil 



Even though there arc many people 
jobless this holiday, this did not seem 
to hall the excessive spending. The 
employment rate was 10.2 percent in 
October, according lo the United Slates 
Oepartinent of Labor. Ukcly, those 



people unemployed were out shopping 
on Black Friday because they were the 
ones who needed deals the mosL 

However. ma&gt;'t)e it is solely tradition 
that fuels people to shop on one of the 
busiest days of the year a person who 
grew up shopping with (heir parents 
as a child probably feels compelled to 
participate yeur after year. 

But still, some pcoplechoseio stay at 
home and shop from their computers, 
which made this ye.ir's Black Friday 
web Mhoppmg more succes^sful than 
the previous year -■ online sales an- 
up 1 i percent from 2008, according lo 
Reuters. Shoppers spent an estimated 
SS9S million in online purchases, 
with the lop rwo online stores being 
Amazon.com andWalmart.com, 

The online shoppers were really the 
smart ones. They did not have to cut 
in front of people, grab elecimnics or 
toys out of other people's carls or get 
aggravated because of no mall parking. 

While [he ofTicial figures for ihcday's 
sales are not in yet. Time Magazine 
predicts this year was a profitable 
Black Friday, at least in comparison to 
previous years. 

"The average shopper spent S37J 
over ihc Black Friday weekend last year, 
which was up from $347 (he previous 
year,* reported Time magazine. 

All in all, although it may have been 
a successful shopping day. the moral 
and ethicality that goes along with it 
was surely mistaken.

URBANA '09 

Struggles within Student Government on Funding a Missions Trip 



By Peter Schnellenberger 

iclvipl 1 OMudenu. Iptw nlu 



The IPSCIA Judicial Court came into 
pluy for the first time (his semester 
during the week before thanksgiving 
break. It acted as an appellate court for 
a dispute over Student Body President 
rVmanda McCann's \'cto of Global 
Christian Fellowship's request to send 
a group of students to Urbana 09, "a 
student missions conference." 

The request first appeared before 
Senate during October in form of Bill 
106T -Urbana HI" requesting 52,500 
for four students to (ravel to St. Louis. 
Miissouri and attend the conference. 
The request stated "Urbana is (he 
missioris conference for North 
American studen(s to hear about 
cutting edge issues in missions and 
to respond to (he coll to panidpaie in 
God's global mission.' 

Although Urbana 1 was passed by 
Senate. McCann vetoed it. stating (ha( 
(he purpose of (his (rip is to 'pmpagale 
a certain religion" Despite her own 
Christian beliefs. McCann does not 
think it would be fair for IPSGA to fund 
a request (hat \vould disseminate one 
religion, or set of belief o\er another. 

"N'eu(ralir\' is precisely what my veto 
is upholding. I would ha^-e vetoed any 
equivjleni request from any religious 
or strong political groups". .McCann 



said. "I believe there is a certain degree 
of separation of church and slate, 
senate has an obligation to uphold." 
McCann mentioned tlia[ if this bill is 
being given unfair treatment it would 
be for it. not against it. 'No other bill 
has been given this kind of assistance', 
she said. 

When the vetoed bill returned to 
the Senate fioor it required a nvolhirds 
vole or l-l votes in total lo over throw 
However, it was upheld by 12 



'Currently there is no rule slating that a 
requester cannot resubmit their bill for 
the same purpose', said Tinnel. Which 
means, any group (hat is unsatisfied 
ivith the Senate's decision over a 
request can resubmit it and get another 
shot at receiving funding. 

Urbana II made it to the Senate floor 
in November, but this time it reworded 
the purpose for the (rip stating, "this 
event is not a missions trip' and 
'Urbana 09 is intended for anyone 



votes for (he ve(o and 4 votes agains( interested in mission. Urbana draws 



veto. people from 

In mos( cases "Afthough Urbana I was passed by all over North 
when Senate Senate. MtCann vetoed it stating America who 

upholds a veto it . . , i. . . want to learn 

is killed, but not that the purpose of thBtnp IS to ^^,„ g^oui 

diis time. It was 'propogate a certain religion'.' global realities 
(ar from dead. and current 

The requesters missions issues." 

of (he Urbana trip appealed (he It w^s passed without discussion but 
decision to (he ludicial Court. Wi(h (he. vetoed because Urbana II was 
(he reasoning (hat there was 'reli^ous essentially the same bill as Urbana I. 
discrimination at play", said Kody The ludicial Court gave McCann 

Tiimel. Student Bod&gt;' Vice President of two decrees in their mandate to her 
Legislation. according to Mandate »MI: Executive 

Tinnel said, he was under the Order«V6. 'ISignthebillasiiw^ssent 
impression (hat for Senate to o\'er and allow the student organization to 
throw a veto, it required a two-thirds travel (o (he URBANA conference as 
vote of the entire Senate, not )usi (hose (he previous presiden(5 have done." 
members anending. and '2. Re-send a veto to the Senate 

.At the same time a second request- (hat prmides a different set of reasons 
147T or 'Urbana 11"- was submined for not siting (he bilL' 
for the same amount as Urbana 1. 'We ha%e never funded Urbana in 



the past", Mc(-mn said. 'A.s far m our 
records indicate, the Judicial court was 
either given false information or made 
false assumption." 

The ludicial Court also gave a 
mandate to Ihe Senate, setting the 
precedent that, 'in order to override 
a veto of proposed legislation by the 
Student Senate Body President with a 
two-thirds veto of all present senator*,' 
they also mandated that 'the Student 
Senate should be obligated lo place a 
vote either in favor of. or not in favor 
of. any le^lalion being presented for a 
vote." In the past Senate members have 
had the option to abstain from voting 
on certain bilb. In some occasions it 
has prevented a Senator from entering 
into conflicts of interest. 

.McCann and some Senators have 
suggested that (he mandates might 
not be legiiimaie because of (he 
separation of powers. *Thcre is a huge 
question over wherher judicial court b 
even allowed to make a ruling on this 
issue, the ludicial Coun exists to make 
rulings based on constitutionality and 
whether or not procedures and policies 
are being followed, here they are giving 
an opinion on whether a group thould 
be given funding, which is a legisUtive 
action' said McCann 

Ultimately Urbana I ended up on 
(he Senate floor for the last lime and 
was approved.

Letter to the Editor 

Response to 
Scholarships' 

I hi» letter h a rnponsc lo ihc 'Beauty txchangcti 
III ScholanhJps' article written by Kristan 
Mftiwh In Ihe November 11. 2009 printing of The 
f^immunlcalor, In her article Mcnsch describes the 
Ml** Von Wayne Scholarship OrganiTation, among 
olhers. a.1 pageants which devalue and objectify 
women In our society because the winner of the 
compctllion must he beautiful. On the contrary! 
VV)illc a beautiful woman is a lovely thing to behold, 
hi-fluiy only compose* ihlrty five percent of the total 
«&lt;ire for the Miss ("on Wayne Scholarship. The score 
Is broken down as follows: Interview (25%). Tatcni 
(35%), fitness A Poise in Swimsuii (15%). Evening 
Wear (20%), ()n-S(.ige Quesiion (5%). so in total only 
3.5% of the compelllion hinges on 'how good' the 
compciiior looks, I don't hear untalenled women or 
llidsc- who do nnl give good interviews complaining 
ahiiul (he competitions.. 

Secondly the organization docs numerous things 
10 help benefit the world around us as a whole. 
They require all of the competitors to raise IOCS 
In donations lo a charily called Children's Miracle 
Network prior lo competing, the Miss America 
()rganl/.ation as a whole ha.s given out over 45 Million 
dollars In cosh and scholarships, making it one of 
Ihe nations leading scholarship assistance programs 
fur young women. Think about how many women 
hive been able In complete iheir college education 
because of that and then tell me this program hurts 
women. 

Mcnsch also 

r.i'tcd that the 




'Beauty Exchanged for 



requirements to enter the comeptitJon included thi.ii 
the competitor must not have e%'er been mamtd 
pregnant, or been an adoptiw parent Musi oi 
these categories are eliminated in the first phci- h\ 
the age requirement of 17-24, While there are siime 
women who are undoubiedly mothers and parents 
of children in ibis age group. I doubt ihe&gt;' have the 
desire or free time nece&amp;sar&gt;' to enter the competition. 
Who really needs the stress of a compctilion being 
added to already large amount of streu that being a 
spouse and'or parent creates? Also note: It's called 
'Miss" f-ort Wayne for a reason. In addition to those 
requirements for entry Men.sch forgot to mention 
the following: Must have never been convicted of 
any criminal ofTen.se, Must not have criminal charges 
presently pending. Must be of good health and 
can participate fully and without limitation in any 
program activilies. Must not use or consume any 
illegal controlled dangerous substances or abuse the 
use of alcohol or other dangerous substances., fhese 
outline another criteria for entering the compeiiiiun: 
moral and good. 

And lasdy the competition website also stales 
in regards to the swimsuit portion of the event, "It 
is up to you whether to wear a one-piece or 2-piece 
swimsuit, both arecompletely acceptable. You want 
to make sure whatever you choose is tastefuland 
not too skimpy'Basically they want lo ensure thai 
the women who enter arc presenting themselves as 
ladies and not sluts. I think it Is wrong to judge ibis 
competition as one which produces a bad image 
of women when it seems to me that Miss Fort 
Wayne would have to be a good role 
model to win the competition. Not only 
would she have to be sman enough lo 



pop culiure, and make It through a 10 minute 

interview, but she would also have to be of good 

moral standing, a philanthropist to help raise 

money for a charily and develop a platform 

which is a community service venture for her 

to work on during the period she holds her lille. 

The current Miss t^ort Wayne, Emily Hart. 22 of 

IPFW. is working on a platform she calls "Tlirning 

Disabilities into Possibilities through Universal 

Design." There is no question that a great deal of 

community service is given by each and every Nhss 

I im Wayne Contestant and they should be rewarded 

for that regardlessoflbe fact that they are beauiiful. 

-i-Their beauty should noi be held against them by 

the women who don't fully understand how the 

■, scholarship program works. They deserve our 

\ thanks for what they do in our community, not 

our disdain for their beauty. 

Sincerely. 
Daniel B. Newby 




"What is more important, an emphasis 

on family and togetherness or emphasis 

on individuality or freedom?" 

By Devin and Hana 



Girl: Family Is always the most importani 
In the battle between Individuatily ,\m\ family 
But, then again, then- nevdn lo he some snrt of 
balance. Take myself for example: 1 am ttying In 
figure out where to draw the line with my familv 
and my education. My parents want nothing for 
me except to be a doctor. I would love to be one 
and I would love to fulfill my parent's ilrramv 
but this is my life. I love loumiiltsm, why should I 
throw away my true talents to do something I do 
not truly want to do. 

Then ynu have togetherness or fn-edom; here, 
I would also go with together nes-s. At some point 
in life, everyone needs to have their freedom to 
roam, explore and find out who they really are 
and what Ihcy honestly want. But after this Is 
accomplished, which - hopefully - it is done at 
a young age. being together with family Is a gift. 
In more cases than not. family will be the ones 
who are there when nobody else Is. Your parenis, 
who aggnivatr yrni to no end, nnr the ones who 
will always have a place for yon to crash and 
your siblings can be your best friends. It all jiisi 
lakes time and commitment. Cooperation and 
patience play a huge tale in family, learning to 
compromise and understand one another Is very 
imporlanl. 

flowever. family can also be the ones bringing 
you down. It rvally just depends on who they are 
■Rdtc some time to truly analyye who you are. 
then take some time lo anntyTC who your family 
Is and what they mean to you. 

floy: Individuality is more important because 
ultimately, &gt;'DU arc the only one who can live your 
life. You have to make decisions ba.«'d on what is 
best for yourself. Vour family's idea of ihal may 
be different from what you actually want. That i'. 
iioL sL'lhsh: it is only being fair lo yourself. Your 
family loves you. therefore no matter how much 
they disagree, as long its you are happy they will 
eventually be fine. 



Letter to the Editor 

Reply to "Beauty Pageant Frustrates IPFW 



.\ttiT a-ading Mr. Hart's reply to Professor (3ain last 
Wednesday, I \Vbs amazed that he could really believe 
that these pageants are based mostly on 'interview 
and talent' and not beauty. I am sure the amount of 
charisma that these women possess does play a role 
in the judging, and I don't doubt that the winners of 
these competitions air exceptional people, however 
the rules that state that you "must have never been 
pregnant' and "you must have never been married" 
deeply offend me. Why don't they just spell out what 
they t\.'ally mean? You must be a pure and vitginat 
girl in order to be good enough to compete in this 
competition. 

1 am the proud mother of a little boy, and money 
is tight. I am trying to further my education, and I am 
a good student. I haw never done drugs, nor have I 
been corwicieU of a criminal offense. Why am I not 



eligible for this scholarship? What is ii about being a 
mother that makes one unbeauiiful and un talented? 
This is a "beauty pageant. If it wasn't based on 
looks, then the women wouldn't be required to dress 
in bathing suits and elaborate goivns. They wouldn't 
feel the need to do their hair and slather their faces 
with makeup. 1 would like to find a pageant that looks 
aiawoman'snaturalbeautyanddoesn't exploit their 
bodies by making them walk around in revealing 
bathing suits so everyone can get a good look. Mr. 
Hart claims 'sometimes the)' are attractive on die 
outside, but [they are] alwa&gt;'s beautiful on the inside." 
1 went to die Miss Fort W^yne website lo take a look 
at some of the winners of this compeduon. Out of 
the pictures showed, it seems to me that ALL of the 
women are beautiful on the outside. I even googled il 
to see ifl could find more ctampIeSi. and I found that 



most of the women are Caucasian, and all of them 
have shiny hair, straight white teeth, perfect skin, and 
thin bodies. 

I support Professor Cain and Kristan Mensch's 
opinion, in that this contest favors young, physically 
beauiiful, and pure women, and partakes in the 
exploitation of their bodies. Since I am an impure, 
unbeauiiful. and unialented woman. I am not eligible 
for this competition. I am not eligible for this chance 
to receive a scholarship to 'assist in my educational 
expenses and pursue my dreams.* AH of the women 
out there who are bigger boned and average looking 
can also forget iL 



Sincerely.

with a llnL'-up and recent label 
cluince, Against Mel hlLs the studio slill 
witli the nne&gt;ise and confidence ofpa.sl 
record I nRS. 

Earlier this year Warren Oakes, 
lone lime dnimmct for Against Me!, 
decided to IcJive the band lo run a 
Mexican rcstniirani. Soon after ihc fact 
(ieorge Rchclu, formerly the drummer 
of fellow riorida punk rock band Hoi 
Wntcr Music, joined ihc Agalnsl Me! 
Ilnc-up taking Oiiko^' place. 

"It was scary for sure," said Tom 
(label, singer and songwriter of 
Against Me!. "U\ like breakme up with 
a girlfriend, It's not easy and it takes a 
while to fully recover. Playing music 
liigelher wilh the same people for 
elglil ^ornL'^l[|llvL■ars gives you a sense 
of^IabiliIvlrly•JurIiFe." 

Ihougli scjry, the change within 
■he bjind is welcome. 

"In a lot of ways it mnkes things 
scum really fresh," said Gabel. "We're 
having in Rn back now ihiuuflh evurv 



song we've written and teach them to 
George, re-examine them. Overall I 
think it's been a tremendously positive 
change" 

In 2005 the band underwent 
another big change, switching from Fat 
Wreck Chords lo major label. Sire, an 
offshoot of Warner. Their 2007 release 
New Wave was the first album released 
under the label and purist fans were 
less than pleased. 

"People are fickle, don't ask me 
why." said Gabel. "1 think essentially 
all labels serve the same purpose and 
ihey arc what you make of them.' 

Tlie new album, according lo Gabel, 
unintentionally spans the influences 
of David Bowie. Tlie Cure. The Smiths, 
rhe Clash, and The Replacements 
among other influences. It took about 
a year to write and prepare for and 
Gabel documented a lot of the band's 
progress on Blogger, also utilizing 
IWitter for short, quick updates. 

Uxpoct to see the new release. 
White Crosses on shelves sometime 
in Tcbruary or March of 2010. For

Souivk like Vn- 



This album W3s 
Kaliy disappointing. 
The main aspect of 
No rah Jones' music 
that was so tnming was 
the deep, embracing, 
sultry dim-Ui bar type 
of vncal styling she had. 
Now. it seems, ^e's 
abandoned the piana 



almost entirely and us 
attempting a siyle that 
her voice is not suited 
for. 

The backing music 
almost adapts a Fiona 
Apple styte. however 
Jones barely has the 
voice to project that 
style of music weU at 
all. Not only is the 
music uniraditional 
of tones, there are 
several pans where the 
album just seems like a 
lease. 

In the songs 'Young 
Blood* and ns^ting 
there are several 
points in which tbe 



music shows promise 
of escalating and it 
has much potential to 
do so, but then fones 
falls backward in the 
contmuaJ lull of this 
album. The listener 
waits for some all out 
heart and soul bui ends 
up being completely 
left for audio-dead. 

As background 

mutic this wouldn't be 
a bad album. e'&gt;en for 
something bonng in 
bsien to while doing

It's truly bad. though.

develop and become more 



comfonablc with herself. 

Huffer suffers from neurofibromatosis {NFl, a 
genetically-inherited disease in which the nerve 
tissues grow tumors. Huffer describes her skin 
complexion as bumpy, a testament to what Nf- 
does to ones body. Though she can surgicallv 
remove the cyts from her face and body, rcgrouih 
is pan of the struggle. Sometimes surger\' is 
necessary, all (he lime, Huffer deals with it. 

It was back in the Spring of 2008 that fluffer 
started building a connection between her 
anform of choice and her physical identity — to 
finally get in front of the camera and not shy away. 
Assitant Professor of Photography, Jim Gabbard 
lectured on Francesco Woodman, an American 
Photographer whos work produced primarly 
in the 1970's would be an inspiration to Huffer. 
Surrealistic in nature. Woodman would often blur 
and merge flgures into their surroundings, an 
effect seen in Huffer's body of work. 

Huffer's second inspiration came that same 
semester in 2008, when Gabbard brought in 
guest lecturer. Elizabeth OpaleniL Opalenik is 
a photographic artist who privaidy conducts 
workshops that fiicilinitir the hewing process

sircnglh. 

By combining Woodman's style wilh Opalenik'; 
vision for Itcaling, Huffer staned her own therapy 
*I wanted to generate images that would make mc 
feel more comfortable with myself, " says 1 lufter 

Shetakes pride in her minimal comprehension 
of phoioshop and used the software only ns 
a cropping tool for printing on canvas. B\ 
using naluriil lighting, f-slops. and shuitc-r-

photographic technique. 'Click, print, donc 
Huffer says of her process. 

What's next for the aivard wmniiij; 
photographer? "I don't want to do weddings and 
senior portr^iits for the rest of my life. Id rather 
irjand make it in the art world," says Huffer, " I'd

The Fish Picks: Top 1 Games 



By Lucat Fisher 



10, NHt-Chtcago eracUiawks ai Pliis- 

burgh Pcnguim on Saturday. This k a 
matchup of two of the bcsi and young- 
vst tL-amsin(hiT NHL Kdth tcam&lt;.h:i^f 
hic and briglii futures But on (lib day 
.intl In this matchup I think that the 
I'L'ngulns will pull out the victory. 
*l. NCAAB Womcn's-.l Ohio Stiilc at 12 
Duke on Thurwlay and 13 Texas at 5 
Tvnncucc on Sunday. In college bas- 
ketball it is hard to go on the road and 
win so in both fiames I'm going with 
the home (cams Duke and Tennessee. 
B. NHA-Ph(ienl;i Suns at Cleveland 
Cavaliers on Wednesday and Phoenix 
Suns at I_A. leakers on Sunday. The 
Suns are in both games but they're on 
the road and will need to play fast pace 
towin. IwillplcklheSunsingameone 
and the Lakers in game two. 
7. NCAAF-3 Texas vs. Nebraska on 
Saturday, llils battle is for the Big 12 
championship and If Texas wins they 
will go lo the National championship. 
I think that ihcy will do just that, I see a 
Texas victory. 
6. NCAAh-7 Georgia Tech vs. 18 Clem-

bid and the ACC championship. ThU 
should be a close game and I think that 
Georgia Tech will come out with a win. 
5. NFL-Minnesola Vikings at Arizona 
Cardinals on Sunday This matchup is 
one of twT) of the best \'FC teams, both 
are high powered hut ai home I think 
the (Ordinals will pull out the win. 
4. NCAAF-S Cincinnati at 9 Pittsburgh 
on Saturday. It's the battle for the Big 
Ea&amp;i title. Both teams are very good on 
ofTetuc but Cincinnati has more hre 
power so 1 think they will win and re- 
main undefeated. 

3, NCAAF- 16 Oregon State at 8 Oregon

2. N(J\AB Men's- 1 2 North Carolina at 5 
Kentucky on Saturday. It Is early in the

will show these young teams where 
they stand. Kentucky has a little more

they can hold offthe Tar Heels.
