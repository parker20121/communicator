Opinion 



The Communicat 



Having better debates 
means improving format 



First, the candidates should not be 
allowed lo set the format of the de- 
bates. By doing so the debates become 
hostages to the campaigns 

Few people seem to realize that even 
the decision to debate is polif i. ,,i in 

thought that Nixon should refuse to „. . 

debate John Kennedy Their reasoning second debate w

people's attention would be focused 
sports, not politics. And if Dukal 
humbled Bush, there would still 



had the prestige i 



Nixon. Besides, having Kennedy on th 
same platforms as Nixon would liav 
made Kennedy appear as Nixon' 
equal. This would have erased Nixon 1 



splendid performance in the 

campaign. 
If the debates are supposed to be for 
the voters, not for the candidate-., (hen
