The Issue of the special election 
stems Irom a decision made lost spring 
by Jeff Sandy. Senate parliamentarian, 
that because a mojority was nol elected

Because The Communicator doesn't

not think a special election could be

Changes seen in GSL 



ByGRETHIEM! 

Stall Writer 
Of all Ihc student loan programs 
being revamped by the Reagan Bd- 
mlnistrallon, perhaps the most drastic 
changes are occurring in the 
Guaranteed Student Loon program, 
according to Mark Franke. director ol 
Financial Aid at IPFW 

"The cut won't be so much in money 
available as in students' eligibility," 
FYankc said. "Eligibility was opened to 
:E'^crvonCin l^BandsincelhcnGSLhai 
become perhaps the most expensive 
program to operate." 

Franke said the main reason lor this 
expense is due to many students who 
didn't originally need Ihe money 
■ jl look Irom the GSL anyw 



'Many were taking the money and 
reinvesting it immediately." he said. 

The federal government pays all ol 
the interest on the GSL white the 
student Is in school. When the student 
leaves school, the government con- 
tinues lo pay Ihc dif lore ncc between the 
student ralennd market interest. 

Be^nning Oct. 1, however, new GSL 
eligibility requiremcnlswill be In force. 
If a family's total adjusted gross in' 
come is more than [30.000 per year, the 
student must Till oul a special needs 
lorm in which need is dfilermlncrt by 
lamily sire and number of children in 
college. 

"The special needs lest Is a simple, 
quick test as opposed lo Ihc FAF. which 
lakes many mo re factors Into sec ounl," 
Franke sold. The Financial Aid Form is

words ol one person In Financial Aids, 
"harder to fill out than a tax Form." 

"The problem is the costs got oul of 
hand when every student could 
borrow," Franke said. "The govern- 
ment cost ol this program Is around 12 
billion a year, so 11 was decided that 
Congress couldn't subsidize lor 
everyone — Jusl Ihose with need," 

Still, if necessary, Franks said that

II not for the interests ol local nature 
lovers, the Fox Island Nature Preserve 
on Yohnc Road would be in serious 
financial trouble, according to 
PreservenaturalislPalBolman, 

"It (the preserve) would have a very 
bleak future if it were in any other city 
bul Fori Wayne." said Bolman. The 
caliber ol people and pride in this city 
have been Ihe main factors in keeping 
the preserve going, he sald. 

"We were pressed to Ihe wall when 
we went into iJic budget meeting belore 
County Council this year, and Ihey cut 
our funds even more," Bolman said 

Most departments allow lor a hlUe 
"fat" in the budget, knowing lull well it 
will be cut, but Fox Island had already 
trimmed lo the lean, he explained. 

Local organizations such as the Fox 
Island Alliance, the luak Walton 

interest groups, have contributed lo 
keep the gates tree and open, Bolman 
said. Still, Ihe budgel for Fox Island 
operation must withstand an almost 20 
percent decrease Irom last year's 
budgel ol 146,000 to$3B,0D0. 

Bolman explained thai these Tigures 
Include salaries for Iwo lulMime em- 
pioj'ees— himself and a general 
mauilenancc man. He hopts Ihe 
financial losses in the educational 
aspect will be pcked up by supporling 
groups. 

A large numberolthcGO.OOO to 100,000 
who visited the preserve last year, said 
Bolman, are people with high school 
organizations Others come for

population, he said. 

The future of Fox Island, i 
other state facilities, is 
becaise of Ihc Reagan budget -cutting 
axe, said Karen Griggs, publicity 
chairperson for Ihe Fort Wayne and 
DeKalb chapters ol Ihe teaak Walton 
League. "Wc think that Ihefutureolthe 
national parks Is in grave peril." she 

Griggs, who has also been a member 
ol Ihc National Board of Lobbyists, said 
that money for city parks doesn't come 
entirely from local taxes, bul through 
matching funds supidied by the Ljind 
and Water Conservation Fund. This 
fund is financed through taxes on oll- 
shoredrilling and timbering. 

On July 17 the National Conventionof 
the Iiaalt Walton League unanimously 
called for the dismissal ol Secretory of 
The Interior James G, Walt This 
marked the first time In the group's M- 
year history that it has called for the 
removal of a federal cabinet olllcer 

Griggs explained that Watt lollows 
Reagan's policy ol multiple use ol 
lands. Such policy advocates hunting. 
Iishing, timbering and catlle-grazing in 
national loresls. 

The land surrounding Indiana's lone 
national park, the ln(£ana Dunes, could 
face Irrepairable damage il mulllple

With Ihc policy switch Reagao

Cut the waste, but 
not the education 



[n order to rcviUliie America and gel 
big governmenl off the hacks of working 
people everywhere. Presidenl Reagan 
has enacted masalve federal budget 
euls. Nol surprisingly. Ihc presidential 
axmen have discovered college 
students. 

While harried academician.^ shout 
(eobly and frighlenetl students run for 
cover, only a few are led lo meel the (oe 
and Blare him alralghl in Uie eye. 

Practically everyone can agree (hat 
money should bo cut from somewhere 
And mosl can agree where the cuts 
should come from: "Anywhere but 
here!" 

But perhaps this is not the most 
conslrucllve altllude lo lake. Everyone 
pays Iflxea on some things thai they 
don't like, and any group that takes lax 
money should be under the same 
scrutiny as any olher group. 

II only stands lo reason that colleges 
should take their lumps Just like Ihe rest 

Bui unlike bombers thai become 
obsolele by Ibe time they are built, and 
missile systems Ihal NOBODY un- 
derstands, education is a real and 
tangible Investment. 

In olher words, it takes an educated 
mind to build a bomber, and, hopefully, 
other educated minds to keep it from 
having lo be used. 

Therefore, education Is the only hope 
for humankind, and a college education 
means more than cramming enough 
facts into your head for a lest. College 



gives you the opportunity to meet people 
you otherwise would perhaps never get 
lo know and to hear belieFs and ex- 
periences that you might otherwise 
never be exposed to. 

These may be called the hidden 
benefits of a college education Benefits 
thai are never charged tor on a fee 
statement. 

Anytime one person talks to another, 
somebody getsaneducalion. But only on 
a college campus, where people are 
thrown together without thought to 
anylbing except an inleresl in an 
education — whether to qualify for a job 
or just lo satisfy a thirst for knowledge 
— does this happen with such regularity 
and intensity. 

So if a presidenl wants to streamline a 
program to make it more efficient — 
good. If a president wants to strengthen 
Ihe entry requirements for a program to 
cut wasle — great 

Bui every person who wishes to go lo 
college and can't is a person denied 
Deny training lo thai person to belter 
himself land the economy that we are so 
worried about), and you deny an op- 
portunily tor that person to express 
himself or herself in a unique way and 
add variety and vltalily lo the world 
around him or her 

So cut Mr. Reagan — slash Mr. Stock- 
man — but remember, both of you went 
lo college to learn how to lead our 
country and cutting wasle doesn't mean 
wasting a mind.

Azhrarn captivates 



ByaiEnVLMVEflS 

In 1978, Tanith Loe 
published "Night's Master." 
and it was one of her best. 
The popular story of 
Azhrarn, Prince of Demons, 
fashioned in an Arabic- 
flavored mythos, brought 
her the August Derlelh 
Award for excellence in 
adullfanlasy 

Tlic protagonist, Aihram, 
Is one of Ihe best constructed 
characters in modem fan- 
tasy; he is tilillaling, 
fascinating, and seductive. 
Lee describes him as "Tall, 
vital, tn'ealh taking and 
immobile . . most rightly, 
and most inadequately,

her passages flow like 
music: "Days passed like 
flames, and nights like black 
leopards, running from 
world's edge to world's

This use of imagery 
creates a sense of the an- 
cient, aslf theseaiorieswerc 
written long ago and have 
come down to us with em- 
bellishments from years ol

Lee lEes Is the introduction

this, too, encourages us to 
believe these things were 
written '"when the world was

This booh has been

Another problem Is the 
connotation of Immaturity 
and silly, unreallsQc subject 
matter that the label 
'"modem fantasy'" often ell- 
cits from much of the 
general public. This Is not so 
true of Lee's fantasy

they Ihcn proceeded lo lose 
three stralghl. 

Last week. IPFW shut oul

In the Trl'Slalc game, 
Mladcn Krai) and Jim 
ShsrpG combined for Iwo 
Tusker goals against the 
nggrcssiveTri-Stfltcleam. 

"They (Tri-Stflte) were 
very Dggresslv&lt;f ond very 
physical," sold James 
Henmupller, a Tusker 
halfback. Although KrnlJ 
and Sharpo scored Iwo 
Tusker goals, Hcnmucllcr 
and Dave Husar praised 
halfback Jim Dwlre for hl9 
nrBlBlnrting performance, 
"Dwife ployed p super

mistakes and he played 
grea I defense," Husar said. 

Although the Tuskera 
broke out of their slump al 
Tri-Slate, Ihey failed lo 
continue Iheir winning ways 
against North Park College 
In Chicago, North Park's 
lone penally kick len 
minutes into the game was 
enough lo give Ihem a 1-0 
victory ovcrlfTW. 

Da pile playing on a 
swampy field, the Tuskora' 
passing and defense were 
sharp throughout the game. 
Still, Ihey Just could not put 
the liall in the ncL 

"Considering the field, the 
passing was good, bul we 
couldn't seem to get the right 
pass close enough to the 
goal." Kusarsald, 

Despite the team's 5-1 
record and 2-1 NAIA record. 
Tusker fullback Husar says 
there is hope "We could still

Spikers working 
busy schedule 

BySllKEFBANKE 

sun Writer 

Coach Amlc Ball's women's volleyball leam began a busy 
schedule last Sept. 29 with a victory over Tri-Stale, IM, 15-7. 
9-15. tS-G. The week went on lo be productive with victories 
over Anderson. Goshen, and Huntington, as well as defeats 
from Kolrc Dame, Saint Marys, and Ohio Northern. 

The TrI-Stale victory was especially rewarding for senior 
setter Kim Hclmann. "We had been lacking the killer instinct 
to beat a team." site sold, "but tonight I think we acquired 
that characteristic " 

Hclmann hoped the team would keep working on acquiring 
leads and not become lacy once they had been acquired. She 
also said she didn't want Ihe leam to be too confident just 
because of the victory. "We're coming along, bul we need 
time to bring it all together," she said. 

Sophomore BethCliristman is happy with the way the team 
Is developing, but would also like to see more "killer in- 
slinct.*' "We're still not mean enough," she said, "and we 
hn vc lo become more consistent ." 

She feels that the team concept Is tiecoming more evident 
with this year's leam. and is conTidcnt that the IPFW spikers 
will gut the Job done. 

Tenmmole Jo Ellen Wilte added, "We have to com- 
municate with one another on the court Tliat way you know 
where everyone Is positioned on the court," 

On Oct. 1, IPFW hosted Anderson College and picked up 
another victory, Tlie Tuskers won In four gomes, 15-7, 15-13. 
G-15. IS-T, OS Sue Hendricks paced the dinners with a team 
high seven kills. 

On Ocl, 1. the team irovcled lo South Bend lo play Notre 
Dame and Saint Mary's at Noire Dame Even ibough Coach 
Ball's siiuadlost to both teams, he was pleased with the effort 

"We ployed well," Ball said, "I think the girls were a Uttie 
nervous playing before a big crowd at Notre Dome, but they 
gotovcrthal quick." 

Nevertheless. Notre Dame won in three sels, 16-H, 7-15, 16- 
11. and IPFW lost toSainI Mary's 1&amp;-6. 13-15, IS-IT. As was 
true with Notre Dame, the Tuskerscouldha\'e easily won the 
match against Saint Mary's with a couple of bounces going 
Iherightway, 

On Oct 3, IhuTuskerscompeled In tournament ot Goshen 
College. Along with IPFW, trtishcn. Huntington, and Ohio 
N'orthcm also com pcted, 

After sputtering at Ihe outset against Goshen, the TXiskers 
came storming back lo win 6-15, lS-12. 15-13. Commenting on 
the win. coach Ball said, "We were a little tired at Ihe 
tKginnlng Irom all of the traveling, but it c£dn'l lake us long 
torealuethatwchadagameonourhanis," 

Coach Ball's spikerB then had the tusk of playing Ohio 
Northern, one ol the bWler Dii-ision III teams in the country'. 
The result was a two game victory for Obio Northern. 

IPFW took care of Huntington College in two straight 
names, ttivine the leam a4-3re«ordfor the week, 

"We're heading in the right direction." tljach Ball com- 
mented "Itwasagreatstepforward," 

The women spikers [Jay al Bethel College tonight, then 
travel to Ohio Northern lor a tournament on Saturday.
