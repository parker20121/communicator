The crimes haven't been

The items are projection 
equipment that has to be taken

Since Sept. 23, seven projec- 
tion units have been stolen from

Kettler Hall.

IPFW Police Chief Lauren D. 
Denhartog explained the LCD pro- 
jectors are favorite targets at cam- 
puses around the United States. He 
has seen numerous reports of the 
high-ticket items being stolen at 
other colleges. 

"This isn't unique to IPFW. 
This has happened all across the 
nation. These things are hot," he 
said. Hot enough, the criminal - or 



explained. 

"It creates a hardship for the 
professors and classrooms who 
have become accustomed to that 
technology in the classroom," 
Fitzgerald said. 

The first reported case of theft 
was Tuesday, Sept. 23. Since then, 
thefts have been reported Sept. 25, 
Sept. 26, Sept. 27, Sept 30 and as 
recently as Thursday. On Sept. 26, 
two were stolen from campus.

According to court docu- 
ments, the plaintiffs were hired by 
Hough Drywall as a clean-up crew. 
When the drvwall company 
learned one of the plaintiffs had

Vereen: Pass art to children 



The Omnibus Lecture Series 
continued with a dramatic flair 
with "consummate entertainer" 
Ben Vereen on Thursday, Oct .2 at 
7:30 p.m. 

Anticipation for the speaker 
was high; in the Walb ballroom, 
where the speech took place, the 
468-capacity seating arrangement 
was nearly half-full half at 6:55 
p.m., approximately half an hour 
before the lecture began. Local tel- 
evision stations were on hand to 
cover the event. 

Unlike usual lectures, wherein 
the speaker stands behind a 
lectern, the stage stood empty, 
except for a free-standing micro- 
phone and stool. 

'1 don't think I've ever seen [the 
stage] set up this way," commented 
IPFW Chancellor Michael Wartell 
in his opening address. 

Vereen entered from the side of 
the ballroom; the crowd immedi- 
ately quieted. While the chancellor 
gave the opening address, photog- 
raphers took pictures of the guest

In recognition of the number 
one psychological disorder, IPFW 
will have a Depression Awareness 
Day on Thursday, Oct. 9, in the 
Walb Student Union. 

From 11:00 a.m. until 7:00p.m, 
there will be booths discussing 
each aspect of depression, includ- 
ing individualized screenings with 
a mental health professional. 

From noon until 1:00pm there 
will be a special panel presentation 
anddiscussion of "Beating the 
Blues with Better Relationships" in 
Walb 222 and 224. The presentation 
will showcase IPFW students, fac- 
ulty, staff andcommunity members 
will be on the panel. 

One of the booths -- featuring 
the National Association for 
Mental Illness (NAMI) -- shows 
students some of the horrific statis- 
tics about depression. For instance, 
9.9 million people (five percent of 



US. 

The event, sponsored by the 
IPFW/Parkview Health and 
Wellness Clinic, will also have 
some of the personal counselors of 
IPFW. Garrett Gilmer, MSW, is a 
big supporter of the event. 

"It's like a health affair, direct- 
ed to everyone who is affected by 
depression," Gilmer said. "There 
will also be massage therapists 
available for those who are a little 
stressed out." 

Sometimes a direct correlation 
to depression, alcohol abuse will be 
the topic of choice during the week 
of Oct. 20 through Oct. 24. 

In recognition of the National 
Collegiate Alcohol Awareness 
Week, the Student Activities Board 
will dedicate a week not only to

Recreation room at Walb under-utilized 



IPFW'S recreation room has 
not been getting a lot of attention 
this semester by students/faculty 
or by on campus maintenance. The 
look of the room probably scares 
students away who are more famil- 
iar with carpeted and cleaner recre- 
ation facilities around town. 

Melanie, a sophomore at 
IPFW works the mid-afternoon 
shift at the recreation center -- 
located on the ground floor of 
Walb Student Union - says that the 

Her shift includes around four 
or five students daily. The scarce 

1 of the facility most likely 



leads maintenance to believe that 
they don't have to worry about the 
dry wall dust in the corner or the 
off key piano sitting in the ping- 
pong room until after 
Thanksgiving, and then after 
Thanksgiving until Christmas and 

The recreation room offers 
great between class-after-class 
games to relieve the pressure of the 
college academics. 

Right when you step in the 
door you are greeted bv five light 
green pool tables that have a 
plethora of pool sticks accompany- 
ing them on the proceeding wall. 
To the left of the pool room there is 
an arcade room. The arcade room

Threads in the tapestry of humanity 

IPFW is a campus full of diversity located in the United States, a country that was 
once considered a "melting pot" due to the influx of other cultures into our land. With the 
infusion of others "different from us" on our familiar grounds, the seeds of prejudice were 
planted and grew, is being "diverse" a reason to ostracize a person or group? It shouldn 't be 
in the U.S.A. or even on IPFW's campus. 

Religiously speaking, we are not supposed to "judge," but nevertheless, we do. We 
pass judgment based on what we were taught as children, what we learned from our peers or 
whoever may have worked us up into a "frenzy" about their group's new and improved vision 
of Utopia. 

We need to remember the historical struggles, as a nation, that we have experienced 
between the North and the South, black and whites, men and women, young and old to gain 
rights for their groups over the years. Everyone has been given their freedom to be acknowl- 
edged, to be heard and be released from the shackles society has placed on their individuality. 

More importantly, we need to accept others as they are, unique human beings who are 
threads in a tapestry of humanity. It takes all types of "threads" to make a rich texture;,a 
beautiful pattern of diversity in America, and this needs to be reflected on the campus of 
IPFW, too.

Eliminating track for golf a wrong idea 



Nobody circs if we h.we .\ world class track 
and field team. This is vvh.il Mark Pope told Mark 
Hopkins - (he men's track team captain - and I at a 
meeting in his office after we found out the news 

The article "Why golf and not hockey, swim- 
ming or men's track" in the last issue of The 
Communicator seemed to have a much different atti- 
tude towards the whole matter. That article would 
have you believe Hi.it there is no way for our school to 
maintain a track and field team, but it may look to 
some that Mark Pope, an avid golfer, just wanted a 
golf team on campus and found a way to make it hap- 
pen. But before 1 go into why golf, I'll first address the 
reasoning as to why not men's track. 

From the article you would believe that the 
men's track team was cut due the fact that we do not 
have a facility, and Title IX issues. The school is happy 
to keep the women's track team and they still don't 
have a facility nor are there any plans to get them one. 
Despite not having a facility, we had a strong record 
and even had competitors thai went to the regional 
tournament. 

The Title IX issue can be a tricky one. Last year 
the school's population was 57 percent men and 43 
percent women not 60-40 as was in the last article. 
"Rounding" pushed the difference from 14 to 20 per- 
cent. After dropping our team, the ratio is now around 
53 percent men to 47 percent women. That is still a 
long way from what is needed. So if the athletic 
department didn't really fix the problem, and if inflat- 
ed numbers are needed to make the problem look 
worse than it really is. It can make one wonder if there 
was even a problem at all. 

Particularly when several men's teams could just reg- 
ulate the size of their teams and end up in the same 
percentage the school has now. The department didn't 
want to do this because they believe that removing 
men from the teams would make them weaker, but 
adding women to the teams would make them weak- 



er as well. Which is it? 

According to last week's article, the populari- 
ty of golf is rcasun enough to ignore Title IX and add 
a men's golf team. Track and field is huge in this area 
also. We have state champions in several events every 
year from Fort Wayne alone, and there is always a con- 
tender for the team championship from this region as 
well. These arc people who are of age to possibly go to 
lollege ,ind need education. Most people who play 
golf are probably more of Mark Pope's higher age 
demographic and are not able to participate in the 
NCAA anymore. What's next, a bingo team? Our team 
was made up of 30 people trom thi&gt; region. We didn't 
have recruits from other stales let alone foreign coun- 
tries Our team did in three years that most teams can't 
do in ten. Our team was the largest opportunity for 
men in this region to get scholarship money and par- 
ticipate in NCAA athletics in the region. The school 
clearly didn't analyze how this team affects the com- 
munity. So if community interest is a Tenant of Title IX, 
why was the men's team cut? 

Simple: the school brought on our team to get 
Division I status then cut us loose when they didn't 
need us anymore. If our program didn't boost num- 
bers and participate, the school would not have been 
Division I today. After we boosted our numbers they 
used it against us to eliminate the team. It wouldn't 
surprise me if the women's team gets cut as soon as it 
is convenient to do so. 

Our athletic department put its own wants 
above the needs of the community. As I noted before 
they don't care if IPFW has a men's track and field 
program. But they do care if they have a golf program. 
If they were impartial, they would have just added the 
women's golf program and actually complied with the 
ratio requirements of Title IX. 



Our political hypocrites 



The hypocrisy among political rivals lias been evident for 
all of us to watch and ponder during the last few days. 

As one conservative talk show host correctly observed, it 
is as if the Republicans and Democrats at a national level have 
"switched scripts. " 

Arnold Swartzenegger has been blasted with over a dozen 
women complaining of his gropes as recently as 2000 - and 
many Republicans are saying it doesn't matter. That was 
then. It's his private life. It's his enemies out to get him. 

They castigate the women bringing forward these charges 

although Vanity Fair wrote an article two years ago about 

Arnold's background for allegedly harassing cozuorkers on 

movie sets. 

At the same time, Democrats are warning of Arnold's 
"pattern of behavior" and asking that voters remember that 
character should count for something in an election. Tlie 
Democrats are screaming California shouldn't elect someone 
who is so prone to touching women without their permission 

And when he's married, too. 

Noticeably, former President Clinton hasn't voiced an 
opinion on Swartzenegger' s mis - well, it depends on whom 
you talk to. Misdeeds. Mistakes. Misunderstandings. Or 
potentially criminal acts. 

r f depends on how seriously as a society we want to take 
the word of women who complain of sexual harassment. 

On another level, the Republicans are saying it's not a 
big deal that someone in the White House possibly released 

\ame of a CIA professional. 

Democrats say it was to get back at the professional': 
husband, who had an opinion — and expertise to back up hit 
opinion — to say the Bush administration cooked the books or 
Iraq. 

In retaliation, he claims, his wife's name was released as 
a CIA operative - essentially ending her ability to make 
sources — and in the CIA, that's pretty much an end to her 
career. 

But it's not a big deal, the GOP members say. She was 
low-level. Hardly worth mentioning. 

So why did they mention it? 

It's all about consistency. If a political party is going to 
seek impeachment against a president because he fibbed about 

exual fetishes, then they better damn well seek at least an 

itigation against a White House that has loose lips about 
CIA agents — especially if it can be construed as a type of 
punishment. 

And if a political party is going to defend with every 
resource available a president who fibs to a federal grand jury 
about something as trivial as a sexual fetish, than they look 
like political slugs if they craw! upon Arnold's bedpost to see 
what type of damage he may have done. 

We seek the concept of bi-partisanship on many days. 

These would have been good days to have it - bi-partisan 
on both Clinton and Swartzenegger having worse manners 
than a blooming 13-year-old boy, and. on the allegation of 
releasing a CIA agent's name. 

But we just receive politics instead.

In the spring, three win- 

d( the "Why Choose

According to a press release, 
the petition asks the U.N. Security 
Council to bring up the Burmese 
crisis and pass resolutions 
demanding the release of Aung 
San Suu Kyi. Aung San Suu Kyi is 
a Nobel Peace Prize winner who 
was a leader in Burma's democrat- 



She has been under 
house arrest since May 2003. 

The petition also asks that a 
report on the crisis be prepared by 
the U.N. and it be presented to the 
Security Council. It also hopes to 
have United Nations member 
states to maintain diplomatic pa-s- 
sure on the Burmese regime until it 
makes fundamental changes, 
according to the release. 

Toole notes the Burmese situa- 
tion is important to northeast 
Indiana because the area has the 
largest Burmese community in the 
United States. 



Campus Hope Center sponsors essay 
contest promoting abstinence choice 



ric with disregard to these things 
Now that abstinence has been 
defined by what it is not, it can be 
defind by what it is. Abstinence is 
choosing to embrace life," he 

Bouey said people can stand for 
what they believe is right. 

"When it comes to abstinence, 
you must stand your own ground. 
Just know that when you say 'no' 
to sex, some people will not come 
around. It might make you feel 
bad; it might make you cry. But 
please remain abstinent and now 
you know why," she wrote. 

Simonis cautioned about the 
effects of a few minutes. 



"If you choose abstinence instead, 
you have the luxury of not having 
to worry about all the possible neg- 
ative effects," she wrote. "Once 
you are married, you will know 
that you have found someone that 
you can trust emotionally, and you 
will be able to enjoy the positive 
aspects of having an intimate rela- 
tionship," she added. 

Campus Hope awarded a total of 
$500 in cash to the three winners. 
Deadline for the essay is Oct. 30 at 
2 p.m. For more information

'AH in the Timing' worth the time 



brightly colored prop 



Have you ever walked by stat- 
ues and wondered what happens 
when no one's around? Have you 
ever seen a painting and wonder 
what kind of a story il'd tell if it 
had the chance? If you have, per- 
haps seeing "All in the Timing" this 
weekend, at Williams Thealer, 
would be something that could 
answer some of your questions. 

The theater is blanketed in a 
generic tan assembly of pieces. 



Overall, every cast 
member is to be 
commended 
their dedication 



and 



rilyin 



fills with an assorl 

posed stiffly. Cu 
the audience is left 
confusion. Three i 
bers arrive wearing work jump- 
suits labeled "C.enerii Art Gallery" 
and the confusion is cleared. The 
stage is a gallery and Ihe people, 
statues. 

Afler a short, but very enter- 
taining bit, with Ihe janitors letting 
loose at the end of the day, the 
gallery comes alive with the 
chimes of an unseen clock. The 
statues awake and begin to greet 
and embrace one another. The 
cleaning staff, although at first 
afraid, quickly adapt to the situa- 
tion and begin to enjoy their newly 
discovered friends. The statues sit 
the crew down and begin to per- 
form for them. 

Due to the apparently seam- 
less blending of cast and stage, it 
was unnoticed when people would 
disappear for costume changes 
They would suddenly reappear 
wearing brightly colored clothing 



t h 

scenes, but I believe it would have 
been just as effective had they been 
tan as well, because it wasn't the 
stage, or the props thai took all of 
the attention, but the actors them- 
selves. The entire production 
moved and acted with such dedi- 
cation and purpose thai merely sit- 
ting in the audience was quite a 
ride. 

The show consists of seven 
different scenes, tied together only 
by the same performers acting 
them out. With no common 
thread, I assumed the structure 
would be confusing, but it was a 
pleasant surprise to witness the 
incredible flow and timing during 
the show. 

Overall, every cast member is 
to be commended on their dedica- 
tion, timing and composure during 
the show. Many of the pieces had 
the audience wiping tears of laugh- 
ter from their eyes, but the cast 
remained straight faced and com- 
posed. The first scene "The 
Philadelphia," set the tone for the 
show and the scenes to follow lived 
up to its standard. 

Some of the more memorable 
moments of the show: seeing 
Kasey Foster, Gary Todd Helmke 
and Patrick Fruchey as primates 
with typewriters, locked in a cage 
as participants in an experiment to 
prove that a monkey at a type- 
ally produce 



vided by Jenn Nickell i 
"English Made Simpli 
added a tremendous amoui 
to the interchanges betwes 

Foster and Fruchey. Nickell 
delivery, timing, and phra 
ing aided the in-scene trans 
tions from laugh-out-lou 
humor to seriousness and though 
provoking silence. 

The incredible command &lt; 
the stage held by the entire ca 
made the same set piece a table to 
and a few minutes later, a tii 
swing. They believed so much i 
what Ihev had in front of them. Ih- 

a skyscraper and a classroon 
among other places. 

I left the show very satislie 
with what I had witnessed an 
haw pi. his on going back and sei 
ing it at least one more time. Bettt 
make plans early to catch th 
show, once word gets out, expei 
big crowds. 

Maybe the next time you'i 
walking through an art gallerv an 
pass py the statue-., sitting Midl- 
and posed, you'll take a secon 
glance. Maybe, if you're luck 
enough, you'll catch a quick win 
as you walk by.

questions about Black History

Of Black History Month, he said 
"my dream is that month is a sacred

In regard to the Iraq War, while 
Vereen voiced opposition, he com-

against the Iraq War, "[you] got to 
remember, you're protesting 
against [our] children. I want these 
children to come home." 

Vereen's upcoming birthday, 
Oct. 10, prompted one member to 
call for the entire audience to sing 
"Happy Birthday." 

"Thank you, that's sweet," he 
said after the audience finished. 

After about 25 minutes, ques-

First Person 

The long walk of an exile 
back to the land of Burma 



By Kyaw T. Soe 

Spifci.il to The Communicator 

My name is Kyaw T. Soe. I come 
from Burma. I left my country, 
Burma, 15 years ago. Then, I was a 
third year Burmese Literature stu- 
dent at Rangood University, i had a 
plan to pursue my career in educa- 
tion. I wanted to be a teacher. My 
future seemed to be very promis- 
ing at the time. But I took a dra- 
matic turn and my life had been 
changed. It was never to be the 
same and I had no idea what was 
about to become of my life. 

Fifteen years is a long journey 
for an exile like me. My trip is a 
one-way ticket. I cannot go back to 
Burma as long .is the dictatorship 
regime is still in power because of 
my belief in freedom, peace, justice 
and democracy. For me, these 
ideals complete one's life and 
secure one's dignity. I love democ- 
racy because it believes and cher- 
ishes freedom. I stood up for my 
belief; thus, I had to leave or else. 

I still remember the day I left 
home. I had nothing but the cloth- 
ing I had on. It was hard to say 
goodbye. 

I couldn't tell anyone where I 
was going? Nor would I be back? 

I couldn't explain how I felt as I 
watched my father as he came to 
tears when he asked me not to 
leave. It was strange to see tears 
from the man whom I had known 
for all my life as a tough guy. 1 did- 
n't understand much then, but it 
became crystal clear to me when I 
became a father myself. 

My-joumey started when I fled 
to Thailand where I spent about 
three years. Living in Thailand was 
not easy. First, the language was 
different. I remember 1 had to eat 
pork -fried rice for months because 
it was the only thing I knew how to 

1 learned the language a lot 
faster and had better meals when I 
met a perfect "teacher" -- Ann. She 
became my wife - now of over 13 
years. We have two beautiful chil- 
dren, Marco, 5 and Tasha, 1.

Though the United Nations had 
recognized my refugee status, the 
Thai authority seemed not to agree. 
Since my first day arriving over the 
Thai-Burmese border I had been 
waiting to hear good news. I had 
hoped there would be some 
changes soon in Burma. Every 
night I listened to the BBC (British 
Broadcasting Corporation) but, 
instead, the worst arrived. 

The regime refused to transfer 
power to the winning party - The 
National League for Democracy - 
and even jailed the leader, Aung 
San Suu Kyi, a 1991 Nobel Peace 

I was upset and very sad. I 
couldn't return home! Why? Had I 
done something wrong? Were free- 
dom and democracy too much to 
ask for? Was power more impor- 
tant than human lives? Taking a 
key role in student demonstrations 
had a major impact on my life. 

Did I regret it? No, I did not. 

Then, I started to worry about 
those still in Burma whose lives 
were in jeopardy. How many 
would have to die to stop the mad- 
ness? Why do the Burmese have to 
kill other Burmese? Why can't we 
live together in peace? Are we not 
all Burmese? 

Trying to make sense of what 
happened, I went to work. I told

Oklahoma vs. Texas. This 
game is being played at a neu- 
tral site (Dallas), so no home 
field advantage will be preva- 
lent. Oklahoma, the top 
ranked team in the country, has 
destroyed ever team in their 
path to the National 
Championship- Texas's team 
isn't as strong this season as 
past teams, and I don't see a 
180-degree turnaround for this 
game. This could perhaps be 
the biggest rivalry in college

too tough this season.

I didn't get a free victory last

Doubt it. Will Vontez Duff be

Larry Fitzgerald? Doubt it. 
Will Notre Dame win? Doubt 
it. Prediction: Pittsburgh. 

Miami at Florida State. 
This is my game of the week. 
Miami has shown signs of 
weakness throughout the sea- 
son, but have managed to hold 
off a few scares from lesser 
opponents. With their star 
running back out for the sea- 
son, the mighty Hurricanes are 
going to get even weaker. The 
Seminoles, on the other hand, 
are rollin', rollin', rollin'.

Story correction 

In last week's paper, the 
story "Why golf and not hockey, 
swimming, or men's track" was 
incomplete. Due to an editor's 
error, the specific reasons for 
hockey and swimming were 
omitted. 



No hockey or 
swimming 

To clarify, part of the 
NCAA's Title IX rule is the sport 
carried by the college is of pri- 
mary interest in the community. 
Because swimming Licks m.ijor 
interest in the Fort Wayne com- 
munity and surrounding areas, at 
this point, the sport is not suited 
for IPFW. Case in point, there 
aren't nearly as many swimming 
programs at area high schools as, 
for example, volleyball, tennis, or 
socce programs. 

Hockey isn't a major 
sport in Indiana, but with the Fort 
Wayne Komet's UHL champi- 
onship last season, is gaining 
interest from this area. 

However, another tenant of 
Title IX is that the university's 
student body mirrors the student- 
athlete body. 

IPFW is currently at an exact 
57-43 (60-40 approxiamately) 
female to male ratio in the stu- 
dent body and athletic body. If 
IPFW would to ever consider 
adding a hocke program, it 
would likely only be a men's pro- 
gram because women's is not a 
popular sport. 

Therefore, adding a male 
hockey program would throw off 
57-43 {60-40 approx.) gender 
equity ratio in the athletic depart- 
ment and send Title IX into a flur- 
ry- 

The NCAA does and will 
punish any university not abid- 
ing by Title IX. 

IPFW basket- 
ball season 

Men's and women's season 
basketball tickets will be sold at 

the Midnight Madness event. 
The season tickets are a pass to 
great NCAA D-l fun and excite- 

The rickets are for 10 regular 
season men's home games and 2 
more against the women's team. 
They also entitle students to 
attend a special homecoming 
pre-game reception with ESPN's 
Dick Vitale. 

Included in the ticket pack- 
age are seats for the exhibition 
games against the Harlem 
Globetrotters and Marathon Oil 
Basketball. 

The best part: Tickets are 
free to all IPFW students who 
present their ID card.

Tough week for 
Hartley's Angels 



By IPFW News Si 
Eastern Michigan 

The Eastern 

Michigan Eagle? tame 
into Saturday's 

women's volleyball 
match with a 14-1 
record. The Eagles 
would bend, but not 
break, beating the 
Mastodons 3-1. 

IPFW came out 
of the gate on fire, 
leading 7-1, but had to 
hold off EMU for a 32- 
30 win. 

The Eagles final- 
ly got their footing 
and ripped oft games 
of 30-21, 30-21, and 30- 
24 for their 15th win in 
16 tries. 

Defense was the 
key for EMU. They 
totaled 90 digs and 
seven team blocks in 



the 



,atch. Four \g a 



IUPUI 

Last Frid.iv night 
in Indianapolis, 

IUPUI used a .346 hit- 
ting percentage, and a 
20 kill margin, to stop 
IPFW 3-1. 

The 'Dons and 
Juguar&gt; split the first 
two games 30-23, 26- 
30, but IUPUI blasted 
their way to wins in 
the third and fourth 
30-19, and 30-22. 

Four Jaguar- reg- 
istered double figures 
in kills, with Rebekah 
Pallikan leading the 
attack with 24, 

Fabiana Souza 
led IPFW with 16 kills 
and 14 digs. 

Junior setter 
Lindi Bankowski had 
19 assists and 10 digs, 
and sophomore setter 
A-hhv Koih also had 



Eagles registered in 
double figures in dig- 
ging, with Ashley 
Cudney topping the 
list at 25. 



For 



the 



Mastodons, Fabiana 
Souza doubled up 
with 18 kills and 14 
digs. Kirsta Solberg 
and Janelle Pollard 
each put down dou- 
bles in kills (15,11). 

On the defensive 
side, seniors Nicole 
Ray and Sarah Leffers 
had ten and twelve 
digs respectively, and 
sophomore Ashlee 
Roth had 30 assists. 



Ball State 

Like a heavy 
weight title fight, 
IPFW and Ball State 
went toe-to-toe at the 
Gates Center last 
Tuesday night, but 
when the final mrds 
were tallied, the 
Cardinals came away 
with a 3-2 win over 
the Mastodons. 

In a match that 
was almost a statisti- 
cal draw, Ball State 
won games one and 
'four 30-24, and 30-17, 
while the 1 'Dons took 
games two and three 
30-27, and 30-23. 

That set the stage 



for game five, and it 
did not disappoint. 
Gave five was tied six 
times, the final time at 
10-all. But, Ball State 
applied the knock-out 
punch, grabbing the 
last five points for a 
15-10 win. 

Each team regis- 
tered 65 kills. Ball 
State had one more 
dig at 106-105, and the 
Cards barely out-hit 
the 'Dons. 172 to 134. 

Some big num- 
bers were pul up on 
both sides. MAC play- 
er of the week, Sarah 
Obras registered a 
double-double with 
21 kills and 24 digs for 
the Cards. 

Cardinal setter 
Stacie Baldwin missed 
a triple-double by 
three kills. (7 kills, 53 
assists, 15 digs). 

For IPFW, 

Fabiana Souza got 
another double-dou- 
ble with 23 kills and 
14 digs, as did Kirsta 
Solberg with 15 and 
20. 

Sophomore 
Ashlee Itoth had her 
best performance of 
the season with 32 
assists and 16 digs. 

Senior Sarah 
Leffers led the defen- 
sive effort with 29 
digs. 

With the loss, 
IPFW falls to 9-7 on 
the season. Ball State 
improved to 7-7 (2-0, 
MAC).

IPFW's Poor 
shuts out 
Butler Dawgs 

By IPFW News Services 

Kristin Mahoney didn't let 
a little cold weather, or 
Canisius College get in her way 
last Friday evening in Buffalo. 
The freshman from 



Newburyport, MA, scored 
twice, leading IPFW to a 3-1 
win over Golden Griffins. 

Mahoney got the 
Mastodons on the board at the 
eight minute mark, chipping a 
pass from Kristy Amett over 
Griffs goal keeper Christine 
Morgan for a 1-0 lead. 

The 'Dons made it 2-0 

midway through the first half. 

Senior defender Shacina 

Hersey put on a burst of speed 

down the left side and scored 



from about 15 feet out. 

Mahoney capped off the 
scoring, with her fifth goal of 
the season, at the 74 minute 
mark from about 20 yards out 
the right of Canisius' new keep- 
er Jenna Gage. 

The Golden Griffins 
tacked on a late goal to make 
the final 3-1. 

Great chances and out- 
standing goaltending high- 
lighted a 0-0 tie last Wednesday 
night between IPFW and Butler 



at Hefner Fields. 

IPFW's Rachel Poor and 
Butler's Katie Sanders stole the 
show in net, each making a 
number of game saving stops. 

Poor turned aside all 14 
shots on goal that she faced, 
including five in the overtime

Setting the pace 



Cross country warn n raiding its num- 
bers, and standards this season 

By Anthony Maurer 

The Communicator 

Wouldn't it be nice if you could have 
double of something? If you are Mike 
Fruchey, head coach of the IPFW cross 
country team, life is good. His IPFW 
Harriers have practically doubled in size 

Both the men and women's cross- 
country teams had only 6 runners each last 
season. This year the men have eleven and 







said Coach Mike 

be attributed to 

! recruiting efforts, as there 

w freshmen in the program. In 

r program is now seen in a much 

• positive light around the state as we 

y become more competitive," he 

The recruiting process has reaped 
great rewards for IPFW this season. 

Freshman Ashley Ritchey, of Leo high 
school, is a rising star. Last month, she 
broke an 18-year school record in the five- 
kilometer run at the Bowling Green 



Invitational. She clocked in at 18:53, snap- 
ping the 19:00 minute record by seven sec- 

This past weekend at the Notre Dame 
Invitational, Ritchey shattered her own 
record by 21 seconds, running an 18:32. 

Ritchey's coaches agree she has been 
an outstanding performer this year. 
"When you watch her race, she seems to 
run effortlessly, and has great form. 
Ashley really laid the foundation for her 
success by committing to her summer run- 
ning and weight training," commented 
Fruchey. 

"It is great to see and athlete who put 
in the great preparation and effort to reap 
the rewards of her diligence," he added. 

"I did a lot of extra summer running 
and conditioning," said Richey of her stel- 
lar campaign thus far. 

The teams are also running away from 
the competition off the course. Last year, 
the women were honored by WICCA 
(Women'slntercollegiate Cross Country 
Coaches Association) for academic excel- 

The women were also recognized as 
an All-American Academic team with dis- 
tinction; they had a team G.P.A. of 3.62. 
Ranking as 8th in the nation among 
Division 1 women's cross country pro- 

"Our goal is to accomplish this every 
year," said Fruchey.
