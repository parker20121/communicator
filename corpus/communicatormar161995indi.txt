New computer system may solve problems 

Financial aid process not 'painless, ' says official 



By Melissa Young-Flores 
Chief Repo her 

Recently, ihc adminislralion began to 
inicgralc a new computer system inio the 
campus. The Student Information 
System (SIS) will streamline many 
administrative processes, although the 
system will not be "fully operational for 
at least a year," according to registrar 
Jack Dahl. 

"About two years ago we began initi- 
aling effons to lake a new direction," 
Dahl said. "The amount of system main- 



tenance could not be kept up with." 

"The fundamental reason we chose to 
do this was 10 benefit the students and 
the institution." Chancellor Michael 
Wartell said. 

The change, however, is not intended 
lo directly affect students, "It [SIS] is 
intended not lo affect students." Dahl 
said. "The net effect is intended lo be 
transparent to siudcnts." 

According to Dahl, the bulk of Ihc 
change will fall on the staff and advisers. 
"The Financial Aid will have better com- 
puter support from the computer sys- 



tem," Dahl said. 

"We have a new financial aid director 
and we expect him to do great things. 
The financial process will become bet- 
ter," Wartell said. 

Dahl commented, however, thai some 
of the problems diat the Financial Aid 
Office faces cannot be fixed with SIS. 
"There is no way for a computer system 
lo make the financial aid system pain- 
less," Dahl sid. 

Dahl contends that many of the com- 
plications are due to the federal regula- 
tions which continually change. 



The buisar's office will also see many 
upgrades with the new system. 
Currently, the office is not run complete- 
ly by a computer system. "The bursar's 
ofTice will finally become a fully com- 
puter operation," Dahl said. 

According 10 Dahl, advisers will now 
be able to authorize lime conflicts in 
schedule, as well as, be able to access 
students' academic history from their 
offices. "When it is fully implemented a 
year away, advisers will have complete 
academic history on students." 

SIS will also decrease "* n^ it 



lakes to transfer credits from another 
college or university. "Wc expect Iwo 
weeks lo be cut off the time it takes to 
get that done," Dahl said. 

Both Dahl and Wartell expect a fairly 
smooth transition to the new system. 
Faculty and advisers have already been 
exposed to training sessions and will 
also be able lo lake refresher training 
courses throughout registration. 

"Anytime you switch from one com- 
puter system lo another, there are prob- 
lems," Wartell said, "And wc are provid- 
i- ,/«. , -t„ training." 



IPSGA presidential candidates 
outline campaign platforms 

Early candidate withdraws from election 



ByNolT.Beckley 

News Editor 

The IPSGA presidential race 
dwindled from three to two as stu- 
dent senator Jeffrey Valdez with- 
drew from the race on Monday. 

No specific rca.son was given for 
Valdcz's withdrawal, according to 
election board 




Baker 



member Anne- 
T h e r e s e 
Peterson. 

Candidate 
Kevin Eads 
was also puz- 
zled by 
Valdcz's with- 
drawal from 
the campaign, 
Eads said, "I 
feel left in the 
dark by his departure." 

Student Senator Cecil Baker 
also was surprised by Valdez's exit 
horn the presidential race. 

Baker entered the presidential 
campaign on Friday, Feb, 24, Baker 
said be has been known for his 
approacbability and honesty, 
"People know I'm honest," Baker 
said, 

Eads said of Baker, "He has the 
students' best interests at heart." 

Special Adviser to the President 
on Multicultural Affairs Chris 
Douse believes both pariicipaois 
have excellent presidendal qualities 
and feels either one could make a 
ccmpeient executive. 

Douse said, "They're both good 
candidates." 

Eads, running on the newly 
formed Campus Collegiate Caucus, 
plans to inlToducc many new ideas 
to IPFW in order to make the cam- 
pDS more accessible to a wider vari- 
ety of students. 

Both Baker and Eads have been 
active in student government this 
icnn. Ead'. became director of exte- 
rior affair\ in IPSGA President 



Mark King's now defunct cabinet. 
Currently, Eads serves as a student 
senator. He also assisted in rewrit- 
ing the IPSGA coFLStitution. 

Baker heads the IPSGA Senate 
coDunincc on finances. He said he 
continually sought to provide com- 
plete knowledge to all the sujdents 
on IPSGA issues. He also is a mem- 
ba of the biology club. 

Baker serves on the advisory 
council 10 the Center for Women 
and Returning Adults, He gives 
campus tours to incoming freshmen 
and reluming students in coopera- 
tion with ASTHO, 

Baker tutors students frequendy 
on his own time and for the last Iwo 
years has tutored widi the Student 
Academic Counseling Service. 
Baker's main plank in his platform 
is adding more tutors and improv- 
ing availability to tho.se tutors. 

Baker said, "If elected, I promise 
there will be tnoK tutors." 

This election promises to be very 
clean with no or very little mud- 
slinging, Eads said, "Cecil and 1 
have discussed the campaign and 
we agreed to run a clean cam- 
paign," Baker said he expects a 
very reputable campaign and says 
be will not wa.ste money in running 
for office. 

If elected, Baker plans to make 
student government friendUer to \be 
student body. '■Here will be a big 
sign on the door of the IPSGA 
office that will say, 'All IPFW stu- 
denLs welcome,'" Baker said. 

Baker said although his door 
would always be open to anyone: he 
believes the tiest way to receive stu- 
dent input on ideas and decisions is 
to be out on campus wilting to talk 
to anyone. "I'm not one to sit in an 
office — I want to be out in the pub- 
lic eye and get advice from stu- 
dents," Baker said. 

Baker also promised a complete 
change in the way student govern- 
ment betiaves "I may make a mis-

take, but I'll be man enough to 
admit I did it," he said. 

Baker also plans on reviving 
weekend mtoring and reluming the 
campus calender to The 
Communicator. He also plans to 
provide the writing center with a 
larger facility and longer hours. 

Baker also said he will investi- 
gate ways lo help students receive 
their financial aid award balances 
faster than before. 

Eads promised to campaign sole- 
ly on the issues and he planned to 
be as accessible as possible to all 
students. Eads also hopes to 
improve communications with other 
student groups. He said, "Student 
organizations need to know we're 
here for all of them as well as the 
rest of the students," 

Eads said he desires to make stu- 
dent government stronger and more 
visible. He said he wants to make 
bis administrauon one the students 
could respect. 

Eads added. "I have not had 
much of a chance to talk to different 
groups of students , , . but we're 
working on speaking to the differ- 
ent groups," 

Both candidates for vice presi- 
dcni of legislation, Terri Grimm and 
Shawn Stanley, have pledged diey 
will not wage war against each 
other, 

Eads said he believes he can 
work progressively with either can- 
didate for vice president of legisla- 
tion, but his support lies with his 
ninning mate, Stanley. Stanley and 
Eads have known one another since 
Joining the French Club. "She's 
very ambitious ... she'll do an 
excellent job," Eads said of Stanley. 

Baker said he believes he can 
work well with the other candidates 
and bad high praise for Vice 
ftesident of Fmance Mike Heit, 

Eads praised the previous admin- 
istrations for their atiempis to make 
student government more accessible 
to students, Eads' campaign slogan 
is "Bringing the campus back to die 
students," 

Heil is running for his second 
term as vice president of finance 
unopposed. Heit also headed the 
Constitution Revision Committee, 
wtiich introduced the new constitu- 
tion to tbc IPSGA on Monday. 

Erin Frindb makes up the third 
part of ibe Campus Collegiate 
Caucus ticket and is also unopposed 
for vice president of student activi- 
ties. Currently, Frindh is on the 
IPSGA Judicial Coun and previous- 
ly served in President King's cabi- 
net as director of interior affairs. 




Student government rewrites 
student senate constitution 



By Nol T. Beckley 
News Editor 

On Monday, a new constitution 
was introduced to the complete 
IPSGA by Mike Heit. vice presi- 
dent of finance; los4 Matos, SAB 
member Jerry Richardson, director 
of communications and Kevin 
Eads, student senator. 

If approved, the new constitution 
will replace the old one on Monday, 
May 15- 

Richardson said. "There were 
significant improvements made to 
make the constitution more feasi- 
ble, efficient and democratic for 
future student govenunents." 

According to Heit. Uie rewrite 
was done in compliance with 
IPSGA President Mark King's 
re&lt;)uest to "clean up" the documenL 
"We deleted 24 pages from the old 



conslttutton during Ihe rewrite," 
Heit said. 

There are several changes that 
have been implemented in the new 
Constitution. The mosi noticeable 
change in the new document is a 
clarification of the rules on referen- 
dums. There were no niles concern- 
ing referendums in the previous 
constitution. 

Another major change in the 
constituticKi was the new prose style 
which replaced the outline style 
used in the previous constiDition. 

Odier changes include a clause 
which adds "one senator each 
selected by the dean of each of the 
schools on campus to represent the 
sDidents of that school." according 
to a statement issued by die student 
govemmeni; another clause trans- 
fers the powers of the full IPSGA to 
die student senate. 



The new constitution will 
rename dw offices of the vice presi- 
deni of student activities to student 
body programming director and the 
office of vice presideni of finance 
to student body comptroller. Rules 
for qualifications to be a student 
government member have been 
transferred from the constitution to 
the IPSGA bylaws. 

The new constimtion eliminated 
the internal affairs committee in the 
student .senate and transferred their 
powers to the judicial court 

Heit also mentioned a major 
change in the way the Student 
Activities Board conducts meeting. 
No longer will ihe SAB have uj fol- 
low Robert's Rules of Conducl. 
"The SAB is less formal dian the 
senate and they wiU be able to con- 
duct their business in a less fonnal 
way," Heit said.

The best Pringle potato chip flavor 



By Kara WhIUng 
Feature Editor 

Well, I am back, my friends, 
and in action. This week's vicliins 
of Ihc "!n Searcb of. . ." column 
were Pringlct brand poiato chips. 
Yep. tbai's rigbl. Ihc potato cbip 
that when you "pop, you can't 
Slop." It's inie, you know, you can 
not Slop once you open the con- 
tainer, Bui, have no fear, the 
Pringle people offer a 'one third 
less fat' variety for those of us 
who are watching those fat grains, 

I tried all six of ibe regular 
types of chips. What I mean by 
regular is that the ones Ihal I tried 
were not the ridged kind, just 
plain. The rating scale for this 
week is based on potatoes: one 
poiato means the chip should 
never have been made: two pota- 
toes mean Ihc chip is okay, but 
something is Just nol right; three 



potatoes mean the chip is great, 
but could be a little better: and 
four potatoes mean perfecdoni! 

Since Pringles are one of the 
best potato chips ever to have fall- 
en on the earth, this taste test was 
very hard, but here goes! 

•OUn CREAM V ONION 

Wow! What can 1 say? This 
panicular Pringle rocks. The taste 
was not 100 strong, but stjll flavor- 
ful. This cbip left a strange afler- 
tasie, but bey, wbo cares, it's a 
Pringlell 

The downside is after consum- 
ing 14 chips you have also added 
1 1 grams of fat and 160 calories to 
your body. (Ouch!) And who are 
you kidding, you shouldn't be eat- 
ing 14 chips at a time anyway, but 
you do when you consume 
Pringles. So, my final rating for 
the Sour Cream 'N Onion Pringle 
is four out of four potatoes. 



SOUR CREAM V ONION 
RICBT CRISPS 

Whether these are "right" or 
not. ihcy sure do taste a litde dif- 
ferent than the regular Sour Cream 
'N Onion. The point of the "Right 
Crisp" is that it has one third less 
fat. But let's face it, folks, these 
crisps also have one third less fla- 
vor, salt, crunch, etc. However, 
they arc still addicbve. With these 
"Right Crisps" you can consume a 
whopping 16 chips for only seven 
grams of fat and 140 calories — 
what a bargain!! Even though 
these crisps keep you slim, they 
also keep your mouth watering for 
more, so it's kind of a catcb-22. 
This chip only gets two out of the 
four possible potatoes: try again 
Mr. Pringle. 

ORIGINAL PRINGLE 

As can be expected, this chip is 
d-e-l-i-c-o-u-s!l The taste, the 



crunch, Ibe salt all arc amazingly 
good. There is not much else to 
say other than go pick up a can of 
Original and you'll be set for life. 
However, along with the Sour 
Cream 'N Onion, this chip also 
has II grams of fat and 160 calo- 
ries for every 14 chips you eaL So, 
kick back and pop open a can and 
enjoy! The Original flavor gels 
three out of four potatoes. (1 am 
partial to Sour Cream 'N Onion.) 

ORIGINAL RIGHT CRISP 

Okay people, what this chip is 
is exacUy what the package says, 
one third less fat. But what the 
Pringle people forgot was thai the 
chip also has one-third less flavor, 
salt, crunch, etc. Just like the Sour 
Cream 'N Onion Right Crisps. But 
they are still pretty good. As with 
the Sour Cream 'N Onion Right 
Crisps, the fat gram and calorie 
count are seven grams of fal and 
140 calories for 16 chips, (Hold 



me back.) But 1 do think Mr. 
Pringle could woric on this one a 
little more. And because of this, I 
give this chip two potatoes out of 
four. Belter luck next time! 

CHEEZUMS 

This particular chip has an 
unnaturally orunge color to it. The 
cbip looks very artificial. So I 
assumed thai the flavor would be 
real cheesy, right? Wrong! Next 
time maybe Mr. Pringle should u.se 
a better imitation cheese, or hey. 
how about real cheese? The same 
fai and calorie count applies to this 
cbip as it does for the Ori^nal and 
the Sour Cream 'N Onion. 
Because this chip does nol live up 
the Pringle standard according lo 
me. 1 can only give this chip two 
out of the four potatoes. (Go back 
to the kitchen. Mr. Pringle.) 

BBQ 

Hello people, what exactly 



were you irying lo prove here* 
Now I usually like BDQ chips, but 
something was jusi not right .ibout 
this one. At first, it was yummy to 
my lummy (as Winnie the Pooh 
would say), but after a few more 
tries, the taste got kind of funny. 
And thai is not funny as in "Ha- 
ha" funny, but funny as in "What 
was ihaiT' funny. 1 was so sorry to 
have lo try this one. maybe I jusi 
got a bad package or something. I 
don't know; all I know is thai you 
won't see me running to ihe potato 
cbip aisle at ihe grocery grabbing 
all of the BBQ Havored Pringle 
chips 1 can get my hands on. So 
my final rating is one potato out of 
a possible four potatoes. 

After consuming a large num- 
ber of these chips I just have one 
question: what is that ingredient 
that makes them soooo addictive? 
If you know the answer please let 
me know.

MUSIC REVIEW: 

OLP CD'S STILL GROOVE ON 



By Paul Tupper 
Features Writer 

There arc two CD's oui thai can 
lake me lo two diffcrcnl cxlremes. 
Neither of which is brand new, but 
boih can be heard on today's radio. 

The Cranberries, "No Need to 
Argue" 

With their first album. "Everyone 
Else Is Doing li. So Why Can't 
We," Ihis Irish band mixed sad love 
songs ("Linger") with songs of 
ambitions ("Dreams"). Here, the 
band reaches into themselves for a 
deeper, more disturbing collection 
of songs. Take the first single, 
"Zombie," a song about growing up 
in the middle of war. 

Family is another issue about 
which the band often sings. The 
song "Ode lo My Family" has lyrics 
written by lead singer Dolores 
O'Riordan, and is liierally a post 
card sent to her family. All of the 
songs have potent, effective lyrics. 
No songs demonstrate this more 
clearly than the title track svilh lyrics 
Ukc {"There's no need lo argue any- 
more/1 gave all I could/bui ii left me 
so sore.") 

The Cranberries could easily be 
compared to another Irish singer. 
Sinead O'Conncr. But the band goes 
where the solo anist may never be 
able to go. O'Riordan has a very 
distinct voice thai sometimes sounds 



like she is irying to hit two notes at 
once. It is ihe voice, the strong song 
writing, and the powerful perfor- 
mance of the other members that 
give this aliernaiive band a fresh 
sound. 

This album lets me see less fortu- 
nate lives and stories, so I give it a 9 
out of a possible 10. 

Ce Ce Penlston, "Thought 'Ya 
Knew" 

Here is another sophomore effort, 
but unlike the Cranbenies album, 
this one is not necessarily an 
imp'rovcmeiu, but ihorc like a con- 
tinuation of her first album 
"Finally." Penision burst onto the 
scene dancing her hean out, calling 
all of us to the dance floor and we 
went. This time, the dancing is still 
available, but she has added more 
slow songs. That's a shame, because 
making us move is definitely 
Penision's strong point. 

Her latest single from this CD is 
"Keep Givin' Me Your Love," a hot 
dance number that is also on the 
"Ready to Wear (Prcl-a-Porier)" 
soundtrack. All of Ihe singles thus 
far have been very danceable like 
ihis one, so it's surprising lo see thai 
this album hasn't sold as well as 
"Finally." 

Penision. who always has a hand 
in writing and producing her materi- 
al, doesn't gel creative with her 
lyrics like, say, Michael Stipe or

The only down poini of ihe 
album is the ballads. It is this same

The §llver Screen Review: 
Xlerks' and 'The Erady Cunch' 



RyNolT. nKklcy 
News Editor 

"Clerks," wriiien, directed and 
produced by Kevin Smith (be even 
plays Silent Bob), is an incredibly 
hilarious and insightful Tilm Smitb 
has been inspired by bis seven 
years oT experience as a conve- 
nience Blore cleric lo inspire bis 
siory. 

The nim portrays a day in the 
life of two convenience store 
clerks, Dante (Brian O'Halloran) 
and his friend Randall (Jeff 
Anderson), who spend the whole 
day discu-ssing life, death, sex and 
love. They also have an interesting 
debate over the merits of "The 
Empire .Strikes Back" versus 
"Return of the Jedi." Randall and 
Dante cover a wide variety of toi&gt;- 
ics in their conversations which 
include "job title" or not to aucnd a 
funeral of an old lover of Dante's, 
whether Dante has brought all bis 
problems on himself or if bad 
things just happen to him and 
whether social position dictates 



behavior. Ratvlall inventively illus- 
trates that title does not dictate 
behavior. 

Tbe movie flows from topic to 
topic and event to event. Smith's 
direction never loses the viewer 
among tbe different plot twists bis 
use of black and white Tilm adds 
ambiance to the movie, 

I wondered, after the film was 
over if Smith had read Dante's 
"Divine Comedy." specincally tbe 
"Inferno," Smith's Dante travels 
through a series of 'hellish' evcnLs 
with Randall by his side to offer his 
guidance, or thoughts much like 
Virgil offered advice to the dark in 
the "Inferno," 

Tbe Student Activities Board 
deserves to be commended for 
selecting the film "Clerks" as the 
movie most deserving of free tick- 
ets. Their ambition to make a 
movie free to IPFW students will 
probably give this Tilm the audience 
it deserves. Although I would have 
paid to see this Ttlm, I'm glad i( was 
ftee.

Firai of all, when 1 went Co go see 
this movie I tiad no Idea thai tbe new 
Marcia Brady looked very much like 
the former Marcia fltady. The resem- 
blance waj amazing. I enjoyed this 
trip down memory lane, since I used 
lo walch •The Brady Bunch" all the 
lime when 1 was liutc. The movie was 
interesting, to say the levi. 

The plot it as corny as can be 
expected of the Brady Bunch people. 
Mike Brady forgot to pay S20.000 in 
taxes to tbe OiS (oops) and if they do 
not pay in a week, the house will be 
auctioned off. Well, as you can imag- 
ine, the kids somehow find out from 
the lispy Cindy and then proceed to 
find S20.000 in one week. ('Cha 
righil) 

Mike Brady works diligently all 
week to somehow sell a design that is 

client. (Remember that Mike is an 
architect.) But if one were lo look 
closely at each of his designs, one 
would notice that each of them 



resembles the Brady house located on 
Clinton Way. 

Meanwhile, back at the home 
front, the kids are doing odd jobs and 
the like lo earn money for the house. 
Bui lei's think about this folks. 
S20.000 in one weck77 Not. So one 
day Jan. the middle daughter, found 
out about this "Search for the Stars" 
contest. At fir^t none of the kids went 
for it, but when worse came to worse, 
they decided lo do it. 

Well, whether the Brady's got to 
stay in their house or not, you will 
have to find out, but there is one more 
thmg I must point oul before I go; the 
Brady's are still somcwhate living in 
ihe era that they originally came 
from, whenever that was. What that 
means is that the movie takes place 
today, in the nineties, and Jan is still 
using a pink suitcase with big blue 
flowers all over it. (Hello...?) 

Another interesiing thing lo point 
out about "The Brady Bunch" movie 
is the way that the old Greg, the old 
Carol and the old Alice were utilized 
in this flick. I thought that that was 
good because it made the movie less 



of a rip off. 

Well, after careful consideration. I 
will give "The Brady Bunch" three 
stars out of four because. l&gt;elicve it or 



CIASSIUDS

one who probably knew who 
Madonna was. (You"d understand if 
you go and see this (lick.)

'Old Fort' worth saving 



The Old Fon is a pan of Fon 
Wayne's history, ll serves as a 
reminder of how ihis lown start- 
ed, and why il is here. 

When the city look over the 
Old Fon from the Allen Coumy- 
Forl Wayne Historical Society, 
people talked about tearing it 
down. They said it would cost 
too much 10 renovate, and the 
land could be better used for 
something else. 

Now die Old Fort belongs to 
the city and it is up to the com- 
mittee formed by Mayor Paul 
Hclmkc 10 decide its fate, no 
later than April 15. 

Recently the Old Fort 
Preservation Society presented a 
plan to tiuTi historic Fort Wayne 
into an Interactive attraction 
depicting life in Fon Wayne and 
[he surrounding area from the 
1700s up through tlie Civil War, 

This proposal included reno- 
vations which would allow a 
wider variety of activities to take 
place. 

In addition to the re-enact- 
ments, the Fori would be die site 
of activities in conjunction with 
the Johnny Appleseed Festival 
and the Three Rivers Festival, 
Educational depictions from var- 
ious periods would coincide with 
die curriculum of area schools, 
diereby creating an educational 
as well as entenaining facility. 

These activities will increase 
the usefulness of die Fon, mak- 
ing it worth the money ttie city is 
going to put into it. 

These are all good things. The 



people of Fort Wayne should 
have the opponunity to experi- 
ence the Fon in as many ways as 
possible, especially when they 
arc funding the venture with 
[heir tax dollars. 

The Preservation Society 
plans to market the Fori in the 
Iri-state area. The question is. 
will ihc Fort ever draw enough 
people lo be financially self-sup- 
porting? If not. are we. as citi- 
zens of Fort Wayne, willing lo 
spend our tax dollars to keep the 
Fon alive? 

The Fort is the reason Fori 
Wayne is here. Without il, this 
city would never have been cre- 
ated. Il is an integral pan of the 
city's history, and its presence 
here serves as a constant 
reminder of this fact. 

Several odier groups will be 
presenting their proposals for 
possible uses of the Old Fort in 
the upcoming weeks. The may- 
or's commiiiee will be deciding 
which proposal is adopted. No 
matter which group ends up run- 
ning die Fort, its purposes should 
be educational, recreational and 
historical. 

Even if we might not diink it 
is important to save the Fori 
right now isn't it worth some- 
thing lo have this landmark lo 
show our children, and dieir chil- 
dren? 

It is a part of the city's past, 
and if we live here, it is a part of 
our pa.st. Lei's not destroy one of 
the most prominent landmarks 
this city has. 



Home detention not strict 
enough for sex offenders 



The jails arc overcrowded, 
and more and more crimes are 
committed every day. Judges are 
faced with a decision - what do I 
do with these criminals? In die 
case of first-time offenders the 
answer is sometimes Community 
Corrections. 

This program restricts crimi- 
nals to dieir homes. They are not 
even supposed to go outside to 
mow die lawn or shovel die side- 
walk. 

Even so, neighbors feel threal- 
ened by diese people, especially 
when diey are sex offenders. 

Allen County has 220 felons 
in home detention programs; 13 
of which are sex offenders. Of 
die total number of sex offenders 
in Allen County, only 10 percent 
are in this program. 

Some neighboring counties 
simply refuse to allow sex 
offenders to be put into these 
programs. Should Allen County? 

So far no sex offender in 
Community Corrections has 
committed crimes wliilc restrict- 
ed to die home. But some offi- 
cials think Ihis is an accident 
wailing to happen. 

Other types of felons corrunil 
crimes outside of their own 
homes, while sex offenders usu- 
ally commit crimes in their 
homes. Their victims are some- 
times neighbors or friends. What 
kind of justice system would put 
these criminals back in their 



homes where ihey committed 
dieir crimes? 

Judges musi make some tough 
decisions about these felons' 
fates. While they are at it, they 
must lake die needs of the com- 
munity into consideration. Are 
diese criminals a risk to society? 
If so, what is the best way to 
keep them from being able to 
commit further offenses? 

Perhaps judges should consid- 
er a punishment which some 
felons have voluntarily submitted 
to in die past - castradon. These 
felons took pills which impeded 
the production of testosterone, 
thereby reducing dieir sex drive. 

The judicial system should 
lake this one step further and 
require the actual removal of the 
testes. With this procedure the 
felons would never have the 
physical urges diat caused them 
lo commit die crimes in the first 
place. 

Though il may sound cruel lo 
inflict a physical punishment on 
a felon, il is no more cruel than 
capital punishment and certainly 
much less cruel than the pain 
inflicted by ihesc felons on their 
victims. 

Maybe this method of punish- 
ment would deter people from 
commilling the crimes in the first 
place. At least it would help pro- 
tect innocent people from 
becoming victims of sexual 
crimes.

Letters to the Editor 



Homosexual column offensive 



To die editor: 

Docs a newspaper have an 
obligation to print everything 
submitted by its slaff? Is there 
any rational jusiificaiion for the 
continuance of Paul Tupper's 
"Homosexually Speaking" as a 
regular feature? Some time ago, 
diis literary offering possessed all 
die compelling attributes of high- 
way roadkill — repulsive, but 
aiiention-geiiing. nonetheless. By 
nOw, it merely stinks. The wise 
thing to do would be lo put ihis 
column and the rest of us out of 
our misery. 

A case for its elimination 
could be made on literary value 
alone. Indifferently written, 
strewn widi aphorisms and trea- 
cly .sentimentality, Tupper has 
only an occasional bout with 
lucidity. Bad enough, to be sure, 
but compounding all of this is his 
abhorrent narcissism, typical of 
those who have fashioned a pub- 
lic identity from a personal vice. 
There is no delicate way to say 
diis. but it is unfortunately true: 
to Tupper, the most important 
thing about a person is the way 
he achieves orgasm. Let diere be 
no misunderstanding: printing a 
weekly column called 
"Homosexually Speaking" is 
every bit as ludicrous as carrying 
one called "Alcoholically 
Speaking." or the publication of 
the inchoate musings of a drug 
addicL The most appalling diing 
of all is the fact that for someone 
immeshed in this hideous 
lifestyle, Tupper seems to know 
next to nodiing about it, or else 



he's disingenuously leaving a lot 
out. If he's typical. Tupper has 
less than a 5 percent chance of 
surviving to the age of 60. 
Surveys of obituaries in gay 
newspapers indicate die average 
age of deaUi lo be 41 years, and 
that is excluding deaths due to 
AIDS. You'd be better off smok- 
ing three packs a day, drinking 
heavily, and riding widiout a hel- 
met. 

The average male homos^Wal 
has relations v^ith 50 ciiffcrcnl 
individuals a year. It's not 
uncommon for one to have had 
sex with over 500 different part- 
ners in his (usually abbreviated) 
lifetime. More than half of all 
venereal diseases are confmed to 
this less than 2 percent (not 10 
percent, as Tupper asserts) of die 
population. The "romance" thai 
Tupper keeps yammering about 
is not die caring devodon most of 
us associate with love, but the 
seeking for more experiences, 
more partners, more, more, more. 
Is it any wonder Qiat he says sex 
is his "favorite subject?" 

Freedom of speech is one 
diing. but there is nothing incum- 
bent upon a newspaper in giving 
a weekly forum lo such an idiot- 
ic, incredibly desiructive 
"lifestyle." Homosexuality does 
not merit the statue of "view- 
point," but is instead a repulsive, 
societal aberration. The 
Communicator is urged to dis- 
continue this feature, and the 
sooner, the better,

Parking still a problem 



I'm writing in regard to the of appropriate students parking 
parking problem here al IPFW. places is limited. The signs 
There seem to be more students aren't 100 percent effective for 
than there are spaces for our no-parking zones, 
vehicles. The general knowledge This semesier I have accumu- 
lated six traffic tickets. I now 
have a S90 balance due. This 
cost has gready diminished the 
amount of my money resources. 
I disagree with die strictness of 
IPFW standards. I have come up 
with a solution. I'd like to see 
more of that nice, green grass 
removed to din and parking 
made more accessible. I'm sorry. 
I can't afford any more tickets. 
I'd appreciate some correction 
and improvement on this prob-

Homosexually Speaking 

GaySy lesbians should work together 



Why can't boys and girls play 
togedier and get along? 

This is an age-old question 
thai some believe cannot be 
answered. I think that is a cop- 
out. Men and women should be 
able to associate widi each other. 
We share diis planet: why is this 
so hard to do? 

It is no secret that gay men and 
lesbians avoid each other. For 
social reasons. 1 can see why this 
separation occurs. Lesbians like 
women, therefor they socialize 
with women. Gay men like men. 
so Ihey hang out with men. The

these social

change? 

This 




makes obvi- 



ous sense to me. Alone gay men 
are few in numbers, but together 
gays and lesbians are numerous 
enough dial they can make diings 
happen. There are so many smart 
people in both groups diat uniung 
the two would only produce posi- 
tive results. I cannot be the only 
one who has thought of this, so 
why is it so difTicull to achieve? 

Case in point: Ta Cum Wah 
Recreation Center. Fort Wayne's 
hot spot for gay and lesbian 
events, is in financial trouble and 
is in danger of closing. This has 
been the location of many won- 
derful gay events such as lesbian 
Softball tournaments, the AIDS 
quilt, 2uid gay picnics. Its demise 
would be a great loss for the 
entire homosexual community. 

To help keep the center gay 
friendly, the lesbian community 
recendy sponsored a fund raiser. 



When 1 found out about the event 
1 began to worry because I hadn't 
been informed of the event. 
Usually I know about such gay 
gatherings and try to attend, espe- 
cially when the cause is as great 
as diis one. I was dien told that 
the fund raiser was a "women 
only" event. 

1 am not normally bothered 
when lesbians hold "women 
only" events, Lesbians enjoy 
women's company more than 
men's. 11 logically follows that 
they would limit attendance to 
women. What bothers mc is that 
this is a fund raiser lo help the 
entire gay community preserve a 
place where we can be ourselves. 
yet the lesbians did not want my 
help, nor my money, 

1 understand that a decision 
was made at the last minute to 
include men in the fcsuvitics. But 
who knew il? There was not 
enough lime to properly adverUse 
and draw the crowds needed. 

If we are going to get any- 
where in this battle, we need to 
pull together, boys and girls. 
Guys, go see movies with lesbian 
themes like "Boys On The Side." 
Girls, go see a gay-man movie 
like "The Adventures of Priscilla: 
Queen of the Desert." Send a 
clear message to Hollywood that 
we want more of these movies, 
records and books. 

Both gay men and lesbians are 
guilty of doing this, I don't want 
anyone to think that it is a lesbian

improve their standings in the 
conference. 

The women's team defcaicd 
the Thorobretlcs 102-85 to pu.sh 
their GLVC record to one game

The Lady 'Dons shot 55 pei- 
ceni from the field and junior 
guard Lindy Jones scored 39

only 40 percent from the field 
but out-rebounded IPFW 51-36, 

The disparity in rebounding 
didn't concern Bowden. "We 
aren't going to get as many 
offensive rebounds when we 
shoot that well." sbe said. 

In the second game, the 
Mastodons squeaked past the 
Thorobrcds, 104-103. to claim 
their only conference sweep of 
ihc season.

IPFW coach Pam 
Bowden said. "We 
played this team at the 
beginning of the year, 
lost by 20 ... 22 points, 
it's a real heart-breaker that we lost by one 
this time. We played a hell of a game. A cou- 
ple of the kids were hanging their heads a lit- 
tle after the last play or two, but the last play 
or two doesn't lose Ihe game. 

"It's nic« if you can make that last three 




point shot like the guys did. but that w^isn't 
happening. We're still young ... I am real 
plcay^I with what we have done, to be honest 
anything we got this year is icing on the cake. 
It's really for next year," The Lady 'Dons 
ended the year with a 9-9 
GLVC record- 
Jones' efforts for 
the week earned her the 
GLVC's player-of-the- 
weck honors. In addition. 
she was selected as a 
first-team All-GLVC 
member for the second 
straight year. Newhard 
was an honorable men- 
lion selection. 

Jones averaged 
22,5 points per game, second in the confer- 
ence and 13tb in the nation. She also tanked 
among the top ten in the GLVC in steals, 
field-goal percentage, free-throw percentage 
and assists. She is only the second person to 
score more dian 600 poinLs in a season for the 



Newhard 



Lady 'Dons,

rebounds per contest in an injury-riddled 
year. She suffered from a bad knee iiear the 
beginning of the season and an eye injury for 
two games. 

In the second game of 
the night, the IPFW 
men's team won 81-78. 

In the first half. 
Bellarmine took the lead 
less than two minutes 
into the game and 
stretched it to 9-18 before 
the 'Dons rallied, Steve 
Sanders made a shot from 
three-point land to tie the 
game at 31-31- The first 
half ended with IPFW leading. 36-31 

With scores of 50-15 and 78-75. IPFW

If anyone can figure out what is 
needed lo coax a two wins in a row 
in IPFW's men's volleyball sched- 
ule, please let Arnie Ball know. 
Finding the one piece to push the 
Volleydons to a point where they 
can win cotisistently is fast becom- 
ing an unsolvable puzzle.

on Mar. 5 and lost the maich, 15- 
12. 16-14. 15-13. to die Aztecs, 

"The difference [between the 
two teams] was blocking and 
defense, especially at critical 
times." said IPFW coach Amie 
Ball. 

"We certainly competed with 
them ., It's just one of those things 
we have to work to overcome," Ball 
said. 



ide hitter Craig 
Collins had a team-higb 18 kills. 
Felipe Ralat added 17 on a .483 kill 
percentage. Scott Lauer and 
Ricardo Soler split the setting duties 
and combined for 60 kills. 

Ball said be is happier with the 
serving, "It [serving] is getting bet- 
ter," he said. The Volleydons 
served seven aces and only 11 
errors. 

John Hyden led the Aztecs with 
26 kills as the team registered a 
,426 percentage. 

On Wednesday, March 8. IPFW

Arena in LaVeme. Calif and won, 
15-6, 15-10.16-14. 

The Volleydons dominated from 
die start, and Ball played the team's 
second siring for the third game of 
the match to gain experience. 

il^XlJc third game,.! playcd.ail die 
freshmen with Scott [Lauer] set- 
ling," Ball said. He added Uie team 
was down 14-12 in the third game 
and scored the final four points id

IPFW with 10 kills. Felipe Ralat 
added six and Chris Farmer. Craig 



Collins and Mike Tcr Molen added 
five kills each.

match to Long Beach State 
University (LBSU), 15-2. 15-6. 15- 
12, for its third loss against an 
MPSL team this year. 

The 49ers jumped on IPFW 
early and dominated the match 
dirougbout to imiwove its record to 
9-5, 

"We played very poorly until 
game three .,. we just didn't play 
well, that's the long and the short of
