Not getting everything you should 
out of your stereo or quad system? 



You may have the most expensive 
quadrophonic system in town, but you have 
to know how to make it perform. The same 
thing goes if you own a more moderately 
priced stereo. No matter what you paid for 
that equipment of yours, you want the best 
quality sound you can get. 

That is why the Graham Stereo City 
people have invited factory representatives 
from Pioneer Equipment to come to Fort 
Wayne. To answer your questions. As only 
a professional stereo builder can. 

You may want to ask them about 
expanding your present stereo to a quad 



system. Or hOw to modify your unit for high 
quality reception of Fort Wayne's four 
channel FM radio station. Or anything-big 
or small-that will help you get more out of 
your equipment. 

Stop by our Fort Wayne Electronics 
store in Glenbrook Mall this Saturday, 
January 18. The Pioneer people will be here 
from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Just to give you 
professional advice on your problems. 

Your stereo or quad system is one of 
your biggest dollar investments. Now invest 
a little of your time to make it work right. 
You owe it to yourself.
