ip artment living for some IPFW 



'At $39 a week for food and lot

Problems, however, do arise. Evonne 

stated that in her dorm, three out of four 
showers don't work. Because of this, 
sixteen girls must share one shower. 

When confronted with this situation, 
Briel admitted when large things go 
wrong, like the water heater, it simply 
takes time to get parts and complete the 
work. As the dormitories are slightly 



it, it can be good or bad. 

The major problem in Yurio's opinion, 
is that IPFW is a commutor campus and 
unlike a large campus like Bloomington, 
there are only small groups of students 
living in the dorms. Students get tired of 
seeing the same people, he continued, 
and don't show much interest in group 
activities. Concordia is really trying to

Every effort is made to help the
