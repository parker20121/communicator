Police sergeant 



Maroney resigns a 



By DENNIS KITE 

Patrick J. Maroney has resigned his 
position as sergeant in the University 
Police and Safety Department, ef- 
fective as of 11 p.m., Aug. 15, 

Maroney stated in his letter of 
resignation lo Maurice Shady, chief of 
the campus police. "Interference by the 
Chancellor (Joseph P. Giusti) into even 
the most routine of police activities, as 
well as legal due process, has prompted 
my decision to leave," 

Maroney continued, "My abilities as 
a police officer are neither wanted nor 
needed to perform the new mission of 
this department," 

Maroney, a veteran of over 10 years 
on the IPFW force, was involved in an 
Incident on March 4 in which a woman, 
who left her lO-year-old child in a 
parked car blocking a fire lane in front 
of Kettler Hall, was arrested on a 
misdemeanor charge. 

As Maroney attempted to handcuff 
the woman, she struggled and bit him 
on the hand. She was charged with 
disorderly conduct, battery lo a police 
officer and resisting law enforcement. 

Sources have said thai Chancellor 
Giusti ordered Maroney to drop the 
_ charges against the woman. 

Speaking on behalf of the Chancellor, 
Judith Clinton. coordinator of 



university affairs, said this was not the 
case, 

"The Chancellor never talked 
directly lo Officer Maroney," she said. 
'■He did not ask Officer Maroney to 
personally drop the charges He said 
the university would file no charges." 

In theChancellor's eyes, Clinton said, 
if Maroney, as an employee and 
representative of IPFW, were to press 
Ihe charges then, in actuality, the 
university would be pressing the 
charges. 

James E, Thatcher, vice-chancellor 
of financial affairs, said Maroney's 
reason for leaving IPFW was his 
"inability lo function as a police officer 
in the environment that was set tor 
him," 

Thatcher ^aid he had talked lo 
Maroney before his resignation was 
submitted. He had tried lo explain to 
him Ihat "if you find you can't function 
as a police officer in this environment. 
then you should seek employment 
elsewhere," 

Thatcher said he has the highest 
regards and respect for Maroney, He 
believes Maroney thou^t he was doing 
what was right concerning the incident 
al Kettler Hall, 

The administration is in the process 
of trying to change the image and the 



priorities of Ihe campus police. That- 
cher said. 

"The top priority isn't running 
around 100 percent of your time looking 
for someone in minor infractions of the 
law,"Thatchersaid. 

Thalcher lays some of the blame on 
the attitude of a few of the officers on 
the training they receive at the Indiana 
State Police Academy prior lo their 
employment here. The officers 
graduate from the academy ready to 
fight crime on the streets, but it's just 
not the same at this university. 

We have means of handling incidents 
on this university that are not the same 
as on the street, Thalcher said. 

In his speech at the Combined 
Faculty and Staff Convocatiuon. 
Chancellor Giusti outlined his views on 
the role of the campus police. "II is my 
philosophy that the role of the police is 
one of service and Ihat the police here 
should first and foremost protect and 
assist people; and second, protect 
property," he said, "I have asked the 
Vice Chancellor to work closely with 
University Police and Safely to do all 
possible lo interpret this philosophy 
into policy and concrete action." 

Chief Shady refused to comment on 
the resignation.

for 19 years, 

Thatcher has accepted a position as 
Vice President for Business Affairs 
and Treasurer at St, Joseph College, 
Rensselaer 

Chancellor Joseph P. Giusti, 
speaking of Thalcher, said, "As Vice 
(Canceller of Financial Affairs since 
Dec, I. 1975. Mr Thatcher has served 
IPFW well. His high level of 
professional competency and ex- 
perience have contributed significantly 



lo the university's current level of 
academic excellence," 

The Chancellor will now consult with 
Ihe faculty and staff of IPFW to begin 
the process of recruiting a new head of 
financial affairs. 

Thalcher said about his new position 
al St, Joseph, "It's an opportunity to 
put my knowledge and experience that 
I have gained from IPFW (o good use,"

with IPFW. he has served as a chair- 
man or member of the University 
Construction Planning Committee, the

as numerous other committees 

Before Thatcher's position with 
IPFW, he worked as the Director of 
Regional Campus Business and Plant 
Operation, Business Administrator. 
Department Business Representative 
and Staff Auditor with Purdue 
University. 

In 1977, former Chancellor Donald 
Swartz, under whom Thatcher also 
served, commented that Thatcher was 
responsible for , preparing Ihe first 
unified- tjudget for the combined 
Indiana-Purdue campus. 



Funds delight Tunstall 



ByBRADLEMNA 

For instructors at IPFW, life is not 
strictly limited to the classroom. For 
many instructors, research occupies a 
place in their academic activities. 

In comparison lo other regional 
campuses in the stale, IPFW receives 
one of' the largest amounts of funding 
for research. 

Graydon Tunstall, director of 
sponsored research and development, 
expressed delight in the amount of 
funding already received this year. 
According lo Tunstall. IPFW has 
collected over $150,000 in grants this 
year, with $102,000 in proposed funds 
for a Crooked Lake project awaiting 
approval from the National Science 
Foundation. 

Grants for projects this year should 
easily exceed the $279,000 awarded last 
year, Tunstall said. 

One project already funded is Ihat of 
Kenneth L. Stevenson, department 
chairman and professor of chemistry, 
who is doing basic research into Ihe 
possible uses of inorganic compounds in 
solar energy. 

Stevenson, who received his funding 
from the American Chemical Society, 
the Solar Energy Research Institute, 
and the Department of Energy, said he 
hoped that his work would help in the 



utilization of inorganic compounds to 
store energy from (he sun. 

Advocating solar energy as 
renewable and environmentally safe, 
Stevenson went on lo say, "Solar 
energy is probably going to be the most 
widely used form of energy in the 
future Sooner or later, we will have to 
resort to solar energy, because it will be 
one of the few sources lef t, " 

Less dramatic, but no less important, 
was a project done last year headed by 
Harry Gates, associate professor of 
electrical engineering technology. 

Gales had several senior students, 
with funding from the Allen County- 
Fort Wayne Historical Society, develop 
a "talking" elevator device that 
enables the blind to more effectively 
use the elevator. This device, which is 
now in place in the Allen County-Fort 
Wayne Historical Society Museum, 
actually tells a blind person which 
button was pushed, which floor the 
elevator is on, and whether or not the 
doors are open or closed. 

Gates sees this, and other projects he 
has done, as coming from a "desire to 
fill a need, primarily to help the 
severely physically handicapped 
person lo communicate." 

As varied as the research and Ihe 
sponsors are, the competition is 



becoming fierce, as money available 
slowly decreases. 

The preparation of the proposal for 
funds and the application to sponsors 
can easily decide whether or not the 
grant is awarded, said Tunstall. 

Each proposal is judged on a scale 
with other proposals by the awarding 
institution, which looks al such things 
as cost, feasibility, and the experience 
of the researcher, 

IPFW employs a strict control on all 
proposals, which involves having them 
approved by several administrative 
offices, Tunstall, and the Chancellor 
himself, before the proposals are sent 
to Ihe main campus of Purdue, which 
distribules them to Ihe proper sponsors. 

Tunstall does maintain a reference 
list of sponsors for anyone on the 
campus interested in finding money for 
a particular project. 



A revised constitution is among the 
top priorities of the IPFW Student 
Senate, which met for the first time this 
semester on Aug, 27 with eight senators 
present. 

Steve Westrick, constitutions 
chairperson of the Senate, said that 
"there will be a major overhaul of the 
legislative branch of Students' 
Government." Westrick and Bob 
GrietKl. another senator, are the ar- 
chitects of the new constitution, which 
will be reviewed by the Senate and 
voted on by its members in up-coming 
sessions of the group. 

From other reports by Senate 
chairpersons, it was learned that the 
student identification (ID) photograph 
sessions, held during registration, went 
well. Plans for other ID photo sessions 
are being made 

Another report revealed that the 
Senate used book sale is not going well. 
Westrick said that this is because many 
students are returning fheir used books 
lo the book store where they can get 
Iheir money immediately instead of to 
Students' Government where they must 



wait until the books are sold to receive 
their money. 

II was decided by the Senate to 
sponsor a student directory service at 
IPFW, The directory, using data from 
computer printout sheets of students 
and faculty here, will list the names, 
addresses and phone numbers of those 
people. 

The Senate feels this is important 
because Ihe majority of IPFW students 
don't bear Ihe names of their parents 
and tracking them down in a phone 
book can be quite a task. Also, it will 
help students contact professors with 
whom they may wish to consult during 
a difficult assignment , 

The cost of the directory will not 
exceed 25 cents. 

The Senate also announced that free 
legal advice will be offered at 5:00 
every Tuesday at Ihe Students' 
Government office. Students wanting 
legal advice are urged lo make ap- 
pointments. 

One student organization. Students 
for John Anderson, was approved at the 
meeting and is now a recognized IPFW 
student group. Contact Students' 



Government for more information 
about this group. 

A hilt was proposed by Westrick for 
Ihe Senate to receive copies of Indiana 
and Purdue universities' daily 
newspapers. This bill was defeated. 
Jeff Sandy, senator, has made 
arrangements with the library to 
receive Us copies of those papers when 
they are removed from library cir- 
culation. 

Because of the resignation of several 
senators during the summer break and 
Ihe approval of petitions of new 
senators, the list of current Student 
Senate members in the handbook 
edilion of The Communicator was in- 
correct. 

The current members of the Student 
Senate are Michael Edmonds, EUen 
Engleman, Susan Jackson, Mark Wells, 
Sieve Westrick, Scott Kuehn, Bob 
Griebel, Jeff Sandy, Ada Fiore, Steve 
Hunt, J. Phillip Patterson, Ed Snyder, 
Brad Howard, Dwight Fish. Jim Luker, 
Diane Hoevel and Blane Ryan, 

Petitions to replace Ihe remaining 
unfilled seats are now being circulated 
by the petitioners. 




Blue jeans fade from 
IPFW fashion scene 




ByMIKESTINSON 

According to a faculty member, this 

year's IPFW students seem lo be better 

groomed and belter dressed with a 
tendency to wear blue jeans less often. 

Although sandals, novelty t-shirls, 
and tennis shoes are still very much a 
pari of Ihe scene, many are opting for 
skirts, dress slacks, and neckties for 
classroom attire. 

One student said she was dressed up 
more because she was either coming 
from or going to work, depending on Ihe 



day. 

Another commented that dressy 
attirewas "just a change of pace." 

A third said that, right now, dressing 
up just seemed lo be the "in" thing to 
do. 

So, if you're into Ihe fashion scene 
and waa' to know what's "hot" and 
what's "not." check out your fellow 
students lo see what they're wearing. 

The basic news is that classic dress 
clothes are in and blue jeans are on 
their way out.

News in brief... 

Trom future looms 



By MARILYN HURSTON 
The future of the troms (tem- 
porary removal office modules), 
now situated between Neff and 
Kettler halls, will be decided by 
Purdue University's Facility 
Planning Department upon the 
completion of Building D, said 
James Thatcher, vice-chancellor for 
financial affairs. 

The Iroms, which house the offices 
of the Division of Arts and Letters, 
the School of Public and Environ- 
mental Affairs, as well as animal 
laboratories, are scheduled for 
removal and replacement by lan- 



dscaping, Thatcher said of the 
planning department's current 
plans. 

"I would like lo see the landscape 
become an altraclive part of the 
campus," Thalcher said. 

The offices in the troms will be 
moved to Kettler and Neff halls and 
Building D, upon Ihe completion of 
the latter. 

Previous lo their current use as 
office buildings, the troms were used 
as classrooms. The completion of 
Neff Hall, which added more 
classrooms, shifted the use of the 
troms to offices.

Drive, park...walk 



The university is gradually coming 
together like a jigsaw puzzle, with the 
skeleton structure of Building D being filled 
In with concrete, and the health, physical 
education and recreation &lt;KPER* building 
taking Ihe shape of a facility much needed at 
this campus (o promote physical education 
and school spirit. 

With the completion of these two new 
buildings, nearly 150.000 additional square 
[eel will be added to the campus. 
' Building D and Ihe HPER building will 
improve the offerings of this institution, 
which in turn should help (o attract students 
to IPFW. 

But attracting more students here may 
result in a problem not considered by 
planning officials. That problem may be a 
lack of parking spaces for the number of 
^udenls and staff who come to Ihe campus 
each day. 

Anyone who was on campus last week 
knows that finding a place to park was vir- 
tually impossible A reason the lots cast of 
the library and north of the Walb Memorial 
Union were lull was due to construction 
workers using some of Ihe spots. Never- 
theless, they hardly monopolized enough 
spaces to create the musical-chairs-with- 
cars game played during the peak hours of 
classes. 

The real reason parking lots were full was 
due to an 11 lo IZ percent Increase in student 
fenrollmenls this fall. The Tigure circulating 



around campus by officials last week was 
over 10.000 students. More students mean 
less readily available parking spaces. 

But the increase In students this fall and its 
effect on parking is nothing compared lo 
what could happen in the future when 
Building D and the HPER building are 
completed. 

If these new buildings help attract even 
more students to IPFW. the first lesson 
students will learn here will be that as a 
■•commuter" campus. IPFW has limited 
accommodalions for cars used lo commute. 

Unfortunately, the university has not 
planned lo build any additional parking lots 
for Ihe new buildings. 

According lo Donald Katter, director or 
purchasing and general services, parking 
lots were built after examining the projection 
figures of students and cars on the campus at 
any one time and by monitoring the existing 
lots during peak hours of use He said ii has 
been found there are alwoys some spaces 
somewhere on campus. 

"Some spaces" or not, a parking mess 
looms in the future al IPFW. There wilt be 
two new buildings and no accessable parking 
lots lo accommodate many of the students 
who will come louse them. 

If IPFW was not a commuter campus, lack 
of planning for additional parking spaces 
mighl not be Ihe oversight that it Is. But 
IPFW is a commuter campus, and it looks as 
though an important piece of Ihe jigsaw 
puv,/,if"ill be missing. 



very glad lo have this 
opportunity to tell you atwul 
the IPFW Students" 
Government. Since Students' 
Government influences all 
aspects of student life on our 
camp feel this is an excellent 
chance to explain our rose. 

Officially, Students' 
Government acts as the 
students' representative and 
liaison with the faculty and 
administration. II is through 
this voice that students are 
able to have their opinion 
heard and work towards a 
better university from the 
students' point of view. 

Structurally, we are 
divided into two groups— the 
Student Senate and Ihe 
Student Union Board of 
Governors tSUBOG). Each 
branch has its own special 
focus. 



The Student Senate has 18 
members and is Che 
legislative arm .of SCudenU' 
Government. While fuiniling 
this function, they have 
worked on such projects as 
allocating the student 
athletic-activity fee, a letter 
writing campaign to gain 
funding for the health, 
physical education and 
recreation building, ap- 
proving students lo serve on 
campus committees and 
recognizing constitutions 
submitted to them by student 
organizations. 

The Student Senate also 
provides such services as the 
free legal advice program, a 
used book sale, a carpool 
matchup service and the 
making of student ID cards, 

SUBOG has 14 members 



and is the social and cultural 
arm of Students' Govern- 
ment- They are responsible 
for planning, coordinating 
and promoting events like 
the movie series, lectures, 
dances, concerts, ski trips 
and Harbor Arbor Days. 

This year we are trying to 
better focus our efforts so 
they will be used toward 
activities and programs that 
will better interest and 
benefit the students. 

The Student Senate is 
looking at the possibility of 
reorganizing their structure 
to include a legislative 
committee. This group

After work on Sunday, I 
attended a "Back lo School" 
parly and thereafter suc- 
cumbed lo the dreaded curse 
of too many beers and chips. 

Getting oul of bed for my 
first day of classes on 
"Monday morning" was 
really a chore. Arriving on 
campus an hour-and-a-half 
before class, I proceeded to 
Ihe Walb Memorial Union for 
a much needed nap 

/\fter recovering there 
from the party, I walked 
around Ihe campus and had 
the chance lo talk with 
others who were ex- 
periencing their first day 
back in the classroom. 

Doug Sherman, a fresh- 
man, told me college is 
"really about Ihe same as 
going to high school." 

After Doug said that I was 
a bit awestruck. 1 mean, 
here is a guy who has never 
been in college before telling 
me college is about the same 
as high school. Come on now. 
Sure I can see some 
parallels, but heck, classes 
here are tougher than high 
school, aren't they? In my

Webster's New Collegiate 
Dictionary defines "soap- 
box" as "an improvised 
platform used by a self- 
appointed, spontaneous, or 
informalorator," 

Well, that's exactly what 
this space is all about — 
Soapbox is an open invitation 
lo the students, faculty and 
staff at IPFW lo express 
their own opinions spon- 
taneously and informally 
about anything. 

This column is different 
from Readers Write, for- 
merly Letters to the Editor, 
which generally addresses 
issues brought out in 
previous editions of The 
Communicator. 

Writers should focus their 
columns (please, no more 
than three typewritten, 
triple-spaced pages) on a 
particular issue, whether it 
be serious or humorous in 



vein. 

We'll be happy to publish 
your Soaptxix — as long as 
it's publishable. The 
editorial board reserves the 
right to edit all columns and 
lo not print those which they 
feel are objectionable. The 
writer's name, address and 
phone number should be 
included on the copy, but 
only the name will be 
printed. 

About a year ago, we 
started a similar column 
called The Whipping Post, 
Unfortunately, we received 
little . response and that 
column died a quick and 
miserable death. But we're 
trying it agin, and hopefully, 
there will be a few of you who 
will also give it a try .

Robert Sadler, a 
sophomore, seems to feel 
there is a lack of cooperation 
between IPFW and the 
Division of General and 
Technical Studies (DGTS)at 
BarrStreel. 

■I was al DGTS before, 
and down there I fell as if I 
were treated like a piece of

was not really a part of the 
universily. The general 
attitude was not good. Now 
I'm taking here two of the 
same basic classes that I 
took at DGTS" 

Confused was the feeling 
expressed by one freshman 
who asked lo remain 
unidentified. "I'm con- 
fused," he said, "but I know 
where my two classes are 
and where Ihe Union and the 
library are, so I'm not 
worried or anything."

and served two years on the 
faculty of Allegheny 
University in Meadville, Pa. 

Last year she earned her 
Master's of Fine Arts Degree 
and taught three classes at 
the University of Cincinnati. 

Her duties at IPFW in- 
clude teaching Dramatic 
Structure and Acting III this 
fall and Directing and Acting 
Styles in the spring. 

She is currently in the 
midst of auditions for "What 
the Butler Saw.' the first 
play of the PIT Theatre 
season, for which she will 
serve as director. 

O'Reilly said, "Things are 
always hectic when handling 
auditions, rehearsals and 
performances at night, as 
well as teaching classes 
during the day." 

Her classes are smaU this 
semester — she has 14 in her 
Dramatic Structure class 
and six in her acting class — 
but she thinks small classes 
better serve the individual 
needs of her students . 



The small number of 
theatre majors st IPFW 
causes the small enrollment 
in these classes, she said. 
Basic classes, such as 
"nieatre Appreciation, fill up 
fast, but the more advanced 
classes don't attract many 
non-majors. 

However, O'Reilly said 
that people in related fields 
of study, such as English or 
communications, should 
take an Interest in these 
classes to increase their 
awareness of the medium. 

O'Reilly enjoys her dual 
role as teacher and director, 
and finds them t&gt;oth fulfilling 
for very similar reasons. 

"There's a great deal of 
variety in twth. Each student 
makes a class different from 
another one," she said. 
"O'Reilly feels the same 
about her plays. "I can 
direct the same play more 
than once — and the whole 
experience is different 
because the people and the 
approach are different," she 
said. 

Although directing has 
been her "main claim to 
fame," she has acting ex- 
perience and says, "1 think 
I'll go into acting full-time 
when I'm 80. That's when 
there's a greater demand for 
women, and then I can make 
my million."

Fort Wayne's alternative 
art space, Artlink, has once 
again proven its outstanding 
contribution to this city's 
fine arts awareness through 
its latest show, "Paper- 
works-Invitational," and the 
addition of its new sales 
gallery next door. 

The show, running through 
September 9, features 21 
Fort Wayne area artists with 
Qne or two representational 
works in anything from 
watercolors, spray cans and 
pencils, to presses, wrinkled 
and torn paper and glue. 

Many of the artists, such 
as Peggy Brown, Debra 
Clem, Katy Dolk. Julia Lyon, 
and Maurice Papier, have 
achieved a certain degree of 
local or regional fame. 

A look at their works is 
enough explanation on why 
this is so. The Paper-Works- 
Invitational is a tremendous 
study in a bit of con- 
temporary design, abstract 
realities and experiments in 
spiritual illustration, 
combined with a very in- 
teresting, yet disorientating, 
professional appeal. 

Other artists whose works 
are represented in the 
exhibit are Rick Cartwright, 
Noel Dusendschon, Karen 
Eckert, Gwen Metric k, 
Howard Hitzemann, Frank 
Mannarino, George 
McCullough, Jim Monroe, 
Dawn Neuenschwander, 
Betty Oettel, Dasu Patel, 
Lois Pieper. Bill Snyder, 
Craig Stekette, Marilyn 
Bock Tobolski and Sher 
Waldrop. 

Also on display in the 
smaller lobby gallery at 
Artlink is a series of five 
woodblock prints by Max 
Rojos. The prints are rather 
large for this type of work, 
consequently opening

themselves up to a great deal 
of detail and room to express 
thought. 

Done in the usual black 
and white, these extremely 
emotional prints are over- 
toned significantly with 
Spanish subject matter and 
style. They create a thought- 
provoking atmosphere and a 
sense that the artist knows 
his material and subjects, 
and has talent. 

Finally, the Artlink Sales 
Gallery, 1122 Broadway, is 
open and located next to the 
existing Artlink. The gallery 
was opened to provide area 
artists with a place to 
display and sell their work. 

At present, a number of 
oils, watercolors, photo- 
graphs, lithographs, and 
brass and pottery works 
fill the walls. In the future 
the gallery hopes to display 
more metal, acrylic, graphic 
art and sculpture. 

With all the new additions 
upcoming displays 



and 



scheduled for this season, 
Artlink promises to uphold 
its tradition as Fort Wayne's 
unique art environment.

One of the highlights of the 
school year is SUBOG's film 
series. Although this 
semester's films are more 
commercial than last year, 
there are still some good 
films included 

The series kicks off this 
weekend with "Allegro Non 
Troppo." Director Bruno 
Bozzeto makes "Allegro Non 
Troppo" men\orable by 
using a variety of cartooning 
styles and music in a film 
that is often called the 
Italian "Fantasia." 

Bette Midler's per- 
formance in "The Rose" 
follows "Troppo" in the 
series. With "The' Rose." 
Midler joins the ranks of 
other singers, like Streisand 
and Ross, who had strong 
film bows. 

Next, Joseph Waum- 
baugh's hard-hitting, factual 
tale of cops, "T^e Onion 
.Field," is a powerful in- 
dictment of America's 
criminal justice system. 
John Savage. James Woods 
and Franklyn Scales all give 
excellent performances. 

Following "Field" is "The 
Eyes of Hell," a 3-d trip into 
the heart and mind of a 
madman. The film has great 
special effects. 

One of the scariest films 
ever made, "Alien." comes 
next. The film is simply a 
haunted house thriller set in 



space, for which the special 
effects won an Oscar. Be 
warned; the film is not for 
the squeamish, especially 
with the stomach scene. 

From outer space we come 
a little closer to home with 
"Breaking Away," a funny 
and heartwarming film 
about growing up in 
America. Dennis Chris- 
topher and Paul Dooley give 
great low keyed per- 
formances. 

"A Xittle-Romance" is a 
charming film about young 
\bvev: Laurence Olivier's 
droll performance gives the 
film an extra lift. 
"Romance" is a good film in 
that it avoids the typical 
cliches. 

FYom the sublime Olivier 
we come to the utterly 
ridiculous, the worst film of 
the lot, "The Black Hole," 
Disney's hugely hyped an- 
swer to "Star Wars." The 
most expensive film in 
Disney's history, it stands as 
a $20 million embarrassment 
to the studio. 

The film that brought 
Brian DePalma to the at- 
tention of critics, "Sisters." 
tollows. II is a frightening, 
dark humored film that 
salutes Hitchcock. Margot 
Kidder gives a strong per- 
formance as a pair of 
Siamese twins, one of whom 
may bea murderer.
