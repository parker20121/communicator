accepted for publication in the 
prestigious Physical Review 

Vasquez' article concern- 
restriction for the existence of 
Turing patterns was published 
in the Sept. 3 issue. 

Turing refers lo Alan 
Turing, a noted British mathe- 
matician and cryptographer, 
who died more lhan fifty years 
ago. During World War II, he 
worked on breaking German 
codes, most notably on the 
Enigma machine. After ihe war, 
he was one of the First to design 
programmable digital comput- 
ers. Turing also predicted ihe 



formation of patterns in chemi- 
cal systems, specifically a 
mechanism by which biological 
organisms will lake form. In his 



ihe inhibitor had to diffuse 
faster than the activator. 
Vasquez has found thai the con- 
ditions can be reversed in a 
moving fluid; thai is that ihe 
activator can diffuse faster than 
ihe inhibitor. However, he says 
the flow has to be of a certain 
type lhal can be achieved in a 
cylindrical tube.

{Information from IPFW 



The start of Ihe 2003-04 
academic year broughl with it 
some very good news for 
IFPW's Department of 
Ciimpuier Science. 

The School of 

Engineering, Technology, and 
Compuier Science (ETCS) 
recently learned lhal ihe 
Compuier Science Bachelor of 
Science program has been 
accredited by the Computing 
Accrediting Commission of ihe 



(C AC/A BET). 

Ken Modcsitt, associate 
dean of External Partnerships 
and Research at ETCS, says 
IPFW has joined an elite club; 
noting of over 1.000 compuier 
science programs nationwide, 
IPFW belongs lo a group of 
aboul 200 accredited programs. 
. Of those 200 programs. 
IPFW's is the First one in 
Indiana to have gained ihe 



CAC/ABET accreditation. 
Some of ihose other accredited 
programs include: MIT, Ohio 
Slate University. Georgia Tech, 
University of Illinois. UCLA, 
University of California 
Berkeley, and all three service 
academies. 

Accreditation of 

Computer Science programs 
did nol begin until 1985, about 
50 years after accreditation for 
engineering and lechnology 
programs sianed in 1932. 

Modesiti says the accredi- 
tation means the department 
now meels all required criteria 
from CAC: objectives and 
assessment, students, faculty, 
curriculum, laboratory and

tional support.

The IPSGA is divided into 
four distinct branches: the 
Student Senate, Judicial Court, 
Executive Branch and Student 
Activities Board (SAB). 

IPFW's website explains 
the Student Senate is the leg- 
islative branch of FPSGA and 
"is responsible for student con- 
cerns, university policy 
changes, student lobbying and 
student service fee allocation. 
The senate is composed of 20 
at-large members and one 
member from each school/divi- 
sion on campus." 

The website describes the 
SAB as being "the program- 
ming branch of IPSGA and is 
responsible for the organization 
of social and cultural events on 
campus." SAB sponsors con- 
certs, dances, parties, vacation 
trips and lectures. The board is 
open to an unlimited number of 
student members. 

The Judicial Court "is 
composed of a chief justice and 
four court justices. The Judicial 
Court serves as a court of 
appeals in all matters pertaining 
to IPSGA," according to the 
website. Sieve George is the

Protesting runs in the 
family. My younger brother 
Chris spent his birthday the 
last day of August as a guest 
of the city of New York, when 
he was arrested for unfurling a 
banner on the sidewalk in the 
Wall Street district of 
Manhattan during the 
Republican Convention. This 
is his third stay in a U.S. jail: 
Seattle several years ago and 
last year in Washington, D.C. 
for participating in a protest at 
the U.S. Senate asking them 
during session to follow their 
conscience and not the dic- 
tates of large corporations. 

In Australia he organized 
a huge conference about Tibet

That's business as usual 
in the United Stales. If some 
people seem extreme in their 
hatred of George W. Bush, it is 
slight compared to the hatred 
he shows for his own people.

industralized nation not to

care and millions in the richest

The United States is so 
unfair, injustice so part of the 
normal day to day routine that 
it's taken for granted, indeed 
it's a virtue for an athelete to 
get a $20 million dollar bonus 
while millions go hungry, so 
it's no wonder Casey calls the 
term "ill-gotten gains" a 
"childish and easy insult" and 
says about the Halliburton 
and Enrons that it is used to 
describe, "a bit overused isn't 
it?" If it's overused it's 
because nothing ever changes, 
corporations rule the 
American psyche, and corpo- 
rate CEOs roam the polluted 
landscape like rabid dogs in 
search of more profit. 

Casey * also states 
"Apparently, discussion isn't 
enough in a democracy." 

Speaking of discussion, 
after getting fired from my 
high school English teaching 
job for my views on the 
Vietnam war, I started Theater 
for Ideas, a community dis- 
cussion program. I was fired 
despite or because of my stu- 
dents calling me the best 
teacher they ever had. and 
backing up their convictions 
with a school-wide protest. 
Here I am all these many 
years later still doing Theater 
for Ideas and things have got- 
ten worse, that's how much 
good discussion does. Past 
programs have inspired others 

menl, public access television, 
and a meeting place for citi- 
zens with mental problems. 
Despite this, or more probably 
because of this, TFI receives 
no funding and I earn no 
salary. Which makes us both 
pretty much worthless in 
American society. 

It's interesting to note 
that the last show called 
"Soldiers Speak" about the 
hassles soldiers have obtain- 
ing benefits once America has 
no further use for them, was 
held right here on this campus 
in February and this newspa-

This is a response lo Scott

Gip's grin should replace Hick's glare 



After his death, people 
called for memorializing 
Ronald Reagan as one of (he 
great leaders of the 1900s in 
America. There already was an 
aircraft carrier and an airport 
named after him (kind of ironic 
since he fired hundreds of air

place his image on the S10, 
replacing Alexander Hamilton - 
one of the founding fathers and 
the firsl Secretary of the 
Treasury. 

Some members of the fed- 
eral legislature believed Reagan 
should be on it since Hamilton 
wasn't a president and only maybe 
presidents are on any of the 
bills. 

As Louis Black of "The 
Daily Show" commented, I'll

'Capitol Steps' share non-partisan laughter 



Omnibus 
Lecture gives 
satire to both 
political sides 

By Jennifer Griggs 

The Communicator 

The Capilol Steps, a musi- 
cal comedy group from 
Washington, DC, entertained 
an over-flow crowd at the Walb 
Memorial ballroom during the 
40th birthday party celebration 
on Sept, 14. 

Though the Omnibus 
Lecture was free, those who 
appeared without tickets at the 
door were not guaranteed a seat 
in the room, including members 
of the press. 

Some people waited more 
than an hour before the per- 
formance began, but were still 
not allowed in. 

VIP tickets were given out 
to friends and speakers of those 
who organized the event, stun-

anticipated the evening's fea- 

Overflow rooms, off the 
main ballroom, were set up to 
accomodate people who had not 
been allowed in the main room.

within fire code guidelines, The 
Communicator was told. 

The performance of The 
Capitols Steps themselves. 
however, did not disappoint the 
audience. 

With non-stop humor, 
lasting more than an hour, the 
five former congressional staff- 
members poked fun at celebri-

logical theories.
