Campus Smoke Free 



By KIMTETER 

Staff Writer 

Taking effect Tuesday, Sept. 1, 

1987 will be what Chancellor Tom 

Wallace claims is "the most pro- 
gressive public policy in the slate of 
Indiana." He is referring lo the new 
smoking policy at IPFW. To assure 
consistent treatment of both smokers 
and nonsmokers on campus, IPFW 
has set aside designated smoking 
areas in each building 

Last fall, a faculty member sug- 
gested that a smoking study be done 
Chancellor Wallace then asked the 
Faculty Senate to establish a steer- 
ing committee to implement a 



smoking policy. The committee was 
made up of chairperson Barb 
Blauvelt. Nancy Chiavetta, Jack 
Dahl, Lenore DeFonso, Michael 
O'Hear, Don Katter, George Patrick, 
Student Body President Kurt Greg- 
ory and vice-president Phil Downs. 
Three on the committee were 
smokers 

The plans call for a citation to be 
issued if a student receives five 
smoking violation tickets la $10 
penaUy each! in a calendar year, 
Otlier plans state that there will be 
no installation of independent ven- 
tilation systems and that smoking is 
allowed in only half of a lounge 



Benefits are numerous to students 
from Wellness Power Program 



The news is full of information on 
health. One cannot glance through a 
paper, magazine, or tabloid without 
stumbling across an informative ar- 
ticle on the well-being and health 
conscious altitudes of this nation. 

IPFW now has the opportunity to 
increase its nutritional, physical, and 
menial fitness awareness level. 
Thanks to the efforts of Julie Cal- 
ahan and Ihe Cardiovascular Risk 
and Wellness Center, located at 3000 
S. Wayne , IPFW now has a joint 
venture with the center. 

The Cardiovascular Risk and 
Wellness Center is a group of car- 
diologists, nurses, and exercise 
physiologist and fitness and stress 
specialists. 

The "Wellness Power Program" 
was started in the fall of 1986. The 
classes are held in the Multipurpose 
Building on Monday, Tuesday, 
Thursday, and Friday. 

What is Ihe Wellness Power Pro- 
gram? "It is a total fitness program 
designed for everyone. The person 
wishing to lose weight, the person 
wanting to increase their fitness 
awareness level, or the person re- 
habilitating from heart ailments," 
said Barb Ahearn, one of the owners 
of Ihe Cardiovascular Risk and 
Wellness Center. 

The program begins with initial 



testing to discover a person's overall 
fitness level.or the maximum work- 
out level the heart can respond to. 

The next series of tests includes 
blood work. A person will be checked 
tor cholesterol, glucose, and trigly- 
ceride levels, and then be given a 
skin caliper test. This is the "pinch 
an inch" test lo determine the per- 
cent of body fat one has. 

A strength and flexibility test will 
also be required. The next step of the 
initial process is the recording of 
your weight, height, blood pressure, 
and girth measurement. Girth 
measurements include measure- 
ments of the neck, arms, and legs. 

A person will then have a nulri- 
tional and stress analysis. From the 
results, an exercise, diet, and stress 
program is devised. 

"We designed the program this 
way lo give you all the complete 
information a person needs to know. 
One good workout a day is great. It's 
all you need with a nutritionally 
stable diet," said Ahearn. 

There are two programs; a low 
impact aerobics class, or a walk/jog 
program can be followed. Both pro- 
grams jointly begin with group flex- 
ibility exercises to warm Ihe 
muscles up. 

"The program is not just a fitness 
program though." said Julie Cal- 
ahan, "We stress educational levels 
to people. We bring in outside pro- 



fessionals to speak on different top- 
ics." 

The topics include physical (run- 
ning and aerobics), mental, en- 
vironmental, spiritual, occupational, 
and intellectual well-being. 

How can the Well Power Program 
help you handle stress? "It brings 
about an awareness. We do exercises 
lo bring about awareness of what is 
causing your stress. We aid you in 
solving your stress level by identi- 
fying the stress. Then we leach dif- 
ferent techniques to help you reduce 
stress," said Calahan. 

"It's a very individual program, 
but we really become social to- 
gether. We support each other and 
it's really bringing an awareness lo 
the IPFW campus," said Calahan. 

Every ten weeks a person's pro- 
gram is re-evaluated. "That is the 
greatness of the program. You con- 
tinually benefit and enhance your 
program so you won't gel stale," 
said Ahearn, 

The benefits of the program in- 
clude lower blood pressure, tower 
cholesterol level, an increase in 
productivity and a tretter outlook on 
life. There's an educational benefit 
in the fact that a person will be more 
alert in the classroom. 

"We arc trying to figure out a 
program for the students. We're 
open lo suggestions that would en- 
able students to fully participate," 
said Calahan. 



The smoking policy also states thai 
smoking in private offices may be 
permitted. The occupant is, however, 
to refrain from smoking if requested 
by a visiting individual. 

Approximately one-third of the 
students and ten percent of the fac- 
ulty on campus smoke. When the 
pohcy is put into effect, ninety-eight 
percent of the campus will be smoke- 
free. The remaining smoking areas 
include private offices. "We have 
done a lot to implement this policy. 
We are removing the ashtrays from 
Ihe walls and the vending machines 
and putting signs up in the entry 
ways and other locations. We also 
have started educational programs 
about smoking," Wallace slated. 

Wallace and the steering com- 
mittee t&gt;elieve the success of the 
policy will depend upon both smoker 
and nonsmokers. Failure to comply 
with this policy may result in prose- 
cution as a Class C Infraction of Ihe 
slate law, 

"We have checked with a lot of 
universities and most of them are 
not doing anything. If there are any 
critics of this policy, then they 
should come forth with another solu- 
tion. Like 1 said before, I think this 
is the most progressive public policy 
in the stale," said Wallace. 

The steering committee will con- 
tinue to determine peoples attitudes 
and behavior regarding this policy. 
Next spring, the committee will 
meet again to determine if any 
changes are needed. 

The designated smoking areas in- 
clude the east section of the first 
floor lounge in the Classroom Medi- 
cal Building, the west side of Ihe 
vending lounge in the Helmke Li- 
brary first floor and designated sides 
of the first and second floor lounges 
in Ketller Hall. Smoking will be al- 
lowed near the stairwells on all three 
floors of Kettler Hall where posted. 

Smoking will be permitted in the 
vending lounge of the Multi-purpose 
Building, in the lounge outside the 
recital hall on the first floor of Neff 
Hall and in the non-aircondiCioncd 
areas ol the physical plant building. 
The red and black dining rooms and 
the second floor window lounge arc 
the only designated smoking areas In 
Walb Memorial Union No smoking 
is allowed in the Life Sciences Re- 
source Building.

ThunJav, Aueun Z7. 1983' 



Faculty changes hurt 
campus reputation 



Changes? At IPFW? 

Somehow this seems like old 
news to those of us who have 
been here for some time. 

But this time the changes are 
serious, and may even prove 
detrimental to the students and 
the university. 

First among these changes is 
the "quitting" of John "Jack" 
Ulmer, dean of Student Services. 
Ulmer, popular with students, 
was asked to resign by Edward 
Nicholson, vice cnancellor and 
dean of faculty. 

These may not seem as drastic 
as some changes in the past--as 
when Joseph Giusti, former 
chancellor, quit, but it wilt cer- 
tainly affect the students more. 
The chancellor deals with the 
administration and the running 
of the university. He deals with 
the students through certain 
channels -primarily through the 
dean of Student Services. 

Uimer took his job seriously 
and will be sorely lost. But his 



leaving was followed quickly by 
that of other administrators and 
faculty members, and the rami- 
fications may be drastic. 

If a university cannot maintain 
a high quality, high caliber fac- 
ulty, then the university cannot 
be expected to produce grad- 
uates capable of meeting high 
standards. A smooth-running 
administration makes student 
life less stressful; with a stable 
staff, students learn to recognize 
administrators and therefore 
know with whom to deal. 

Not only does this affect the 
students but it reflects poorly on 
the university If the community 
only hears of administrators 
quitting, then what impression 
does this give? Would you invest 
in a corporation whose board of 
directors changes every year? 
How can we expect Fort Wayne 
to put faith in IPFW when there 
is so much turmoil within our 
faculty? 



Dream campus fails to 
materialize at IPFW 




Welcome back to a brand new 
semester at IPFW. Another six- 
teen weeks of brilliantly deliv- 
ered lectures and amazingly 
simple comprehensive tests. The 
professors are more than happy 
to share their vast store of 
knowledge with the student body. 
The students are eager to learn 
and immensely grateful for any 
little bit of wisdom the faculty 
might bestow. 

The class rooms are bright and 
cheerful, sunlight streams from 
the many, many windows that 
grace the walls. The French chef 
is slicing the Duck a'la Orange 
at le Forte restaurant 

Chancellor Wallace has an- 
nounced that since he cares so 
deeply about all the students at 
IPFW, he is raising their grade 
point averages one full point, 

WAKE UP! You're dreaming! 
Those things don't happen in real 
life. It's a fairy tale. 

Brilliantly delivered lectures. 
Is that when the professor turns 
on the projector and leaves the 
room? Or they don't bother 
showing up at all? 

And it's not just the professors. 
How can they "be expected to feel 
enthused about teacning students 
who would rather be in El Sal- 
vador fighting with the resist- 
ance (at least one could catch a 
few rays) or anywhere else in 
the world 



And windows streaming with 
sunlight? Most of the classrooms 
resemble mausoleums; all they 
need is a few crypts. And the 
only thing edible at the Fort is 
the' paper napkins and straw 
wrappers. 

Welcome back everyone. 

Okay, so maybe IPFW isn't the 
perfect college. Think of all the 
good things here. 

Like the ambiance. IPFW has 
plenty of ambiance because the 
administration has decided it's 
more important to have trees 
and grass than enough parking 
space. Of course one can not 
commune with nature in the 
windowless classroom, but it's 
there. 

And IPFW has a whole new 
bunch of freshmen to harass. For 
instance, when they ask where 
Kettler Hall is, tell 'em it's over 
in the State Developmental Cen- 
ter across the street. Or tell 'em 
freshmen have t* park at 
Glenbrook and walk (that also 
solves the parking problem). 

But the best part about IPFW 
is the people. Not the ones who 
smoke in the No Smoking sec- 
tions; but the ones who hold 
doors open for you and lend you 
their notes when you inadvert- 
ently miss a class. It's these 
people who make life at IPFW 
endurable and sometimes even 
enjoyable.

mess; 



SUBOG plans events for new year 



Uniform changes may 
signal something deeper 



An open letter to the students 
of IPFW: 

Well, here we go again! An- 
other year of studying, cram- 
ming for exams, and worrying 
about grades. One thing to look 
forward to in this somewhat 
bleak picture is that Students' 
Government will be working for 
you. 

The Student Union Board of 
Governors (SUBOG) have had a 
busy summer planning activities. 
To start the year off right, Henry 
Lee Summer will perform out- 
side the Fort on Sunday, Sept. 13, 
at 8 p,m. SUBOG has also 
planned six parties, a Colorado 
ski trip, a spring break trip, and 
many mid-day diversions. 

Your Senate has been equally 
busy. To make life a little more 
enjoyable they have purchased a 
wide screen TV for the first floor 
lounge of the Union, For those of 
you who need to use computers, 
a computer room has been added 
to the Union facilities. Students' 
Government helped to reduce the 
cost by buying three personal 
computers for this room. 

Again, we will be offering stu- 
dent discounts at local busi- 
nesses, AJl you have to do is 
present your school I.D. when 
buying something at one of the 
businesses listed in the discount 



brochure. The brochures are lo- 
cated on the newspaper racks or 
in Walb Union suite 225. 

To protect students' rights, the 
Senate has passed resolution 
8788-A. This resolution calls for 
student representation on the 
committee that will make rec- 
ommendations on restructuring 
Student Services, In response to 
this resolution, the Chancellor 
has decided to use his advisory 
committee, which includes stu- 
dents, for this purpose. 

In addition to overseeing the 
above mentioned items. I have 
also been working with all of the 
other state-supported institutions 
to establish a cohesive group 
that will lobby the state legisla- 
ture for student concerns. This 
group, if established, will benefit 
every student at IPFW as well as 
those on other campuses. This 
issue is one of my highest prior- 
ities. 

In closing, I would like to add 
that if any of you ever have a 
concern with which I could as- 
sist, I will be more than happy to 
meet with you, I can be located 
in the Walb Memorial Uniort, 
suite 225, or contacted by calling 
481-6586. 

Sincerely, 

Kurt Gregory 

Student Body President

Word has it around IPFW that 
the colors of the uniforms of the 
athletic teams will soon change 
from red and gold to blue and 
silver. No official word of the 
change has been made, but all 
new uniforms purchased by the 
athletic department may be in 
these colors. No reason has been 
given for the change. 

It may be a part of an ongoing 
movement of late to upgrade the 
quality of the sports department. 
The idea that new colors will 
install a pride in the athletes and 
fans, making winners out of 
losers, is not a bad one. 

If new colors help the morale 
of our sports teams then all is 
well and good, but could there be 
another reason for the new hues 



at the athletic center? 

Once again the idea of in- 
dependence rears its ugly head. 
The combination of gold and red 
may not be appealmg to most, 
but it does show our ties with our 
parent universities. 

Is this another subtle move 
toward a break with Indiana and 
Purdue universities? Will our 
association with these two 
schools soon be a thing of the 
past along with the red and gold 
uniforms? 

We hope that the change of 
colors is as simple as that and 
that no university politics are 
involved. At this point, IPFW 
carmot handle much more of the 
politics it's seen in the past few 
years.

By MICHELE SHAFFER 

There's a face missing 
in IPFWs Office of Stu- 
dent Services this fall. 

COMMENTARY 

John Ulmer, who has 
faithfully served this uni- 
versity's Office of Student 
Services as assistant dean 
from 1968 to 1973 and as 
dean since 1973, was asked 
to resign this summer by 
the IPFW administration, 

A need for "fresh blood" 
in Student Services, too 
much involvement with 
the students, and a ten- 
dency to fight for the un- 
derdog and buck the sys- 
tem were cited and ru- 
mored as reasons for ask- 
ing Ulmer to resign. 

If you ask me, one 
would have to be an idiot 
to consider "Jack" Ulmer 
an undesirable person to 
serve as dean of Student 
Services, 

What do they mean by 
saying they need "fresh 
blood" in Uic office? How 
could people who have 
been at IPFW for a rela- 
tively short lime have the 
audacity to say the uni- 
versity needs "fresh 
blood" in Student Ser- 
vices'" How could people 
who never took the lime to 
ask students what they 
thought of Jack have the 
audacity to say the school 
needed "fresh blood" in 
Jack's office? To me, 
"fresh blood" is just an- 
other term for a middle- 
aged yes-man. 



What, may I ask, is a 
dean of Student Services 
to do if he is not to get 
involved with (he students 
he is charged with repre- 
senting? Students at iPFW 
are a unique breed in that 
they have many, many 
needs The younger stu- 
dents need more social 
activities than older stu- 
dents who probably have a 
great need for childcare. 
Providing services for 
disabled students requires 
special attention, as does 
the recruitment of minor- 
ity faculty and students. 
All of these were causes 
lor which Jack fought long 
and hard. 

Jack began working for 
Indiana University at Fort 
Wayne in 19H and knew 
IPFW needed these things. 
And, unlike many others, 
he had the guts to fight on 
the front line for them. He 
always fought at the front 
for all of the students. 

The aforementioned 
causes and many others 



that 



any 



probably never know 
about were the types of 
causes Ulmer cham- 
pioned. It's not surprising. 
Those were all Uiings that 
were not very popular 
with the powers that l)e in 
the wide realm of Purdue 
and Indiana universities. 
But Ulmer admittedly 
fought for the underdog, 
even when it endangered 
his own career. 

What would have hap- 
pened if Jack hadn't 
bucked the system when 
others were afraid to do 
so? What would have 



happened to the tine arts 
building, to which Purdue 
President Steven Beering 
has finally pledged his 
public support, if Jack 
wouldn't have been behind 
the students all the way- 
coordinating their efforts, 
encouraging them to keep 
lobbying the state legisla- 
ture for the funds to build 
a fine arts building on the 
IPFW campus? The whole' 
idea could have been 
nixed long ago. 

What would this place, 
these hallowed grounds of 
IPFW, be like it every 
administrator and every 
professor were yes-men 
and yes-women^ to the 
upper echelon of IPFW? 

Firing a person or 
demoting a person who 
"bucks the system" at a 
university is certainly not 
representative of fhe 
dogmas of freedom of 
speech and a free, demo- 
cratic society that are en- 
couraged at most uni- 
versities. 

All those allegations 
about Jack are true. He's 
no spring chicken. He'd be 
the first to admit it. He 
does get involved with the 
students— a lot, I know of 
no other administrator 
who knows as many stu- 
dents on a first name 
basis as Jack, and the 
students still like him— a 
lot Jack has to gel to 
know the students. Having 
a dean of students who did 
not get to know the stu- 
dents he represented 
would be like having a 
vice chancellor and dean 



of faculty who did not 
bother to familiarize him- 
self with the faculty and 
staff he represented. 

But Jack could not en- 
vision his job in any other 
manner, I rememtier last 
spring he told me he didn't 
see how he could do his 
job if his door wasn't open 
and if he couldn't interact 
with the students. He 
viewed himself as the life- 
line from the students to 
the chancellor. 

What it comes right 
down to is when the IPFW 
administration asked Jack 
to resign, it was doing a 
great disservice to IPFW 
students. It seems as if 
someone, somewhere, 
doesn't really want pro- 
gressive, social and ed- 
ucational things to develop 
in the IPFW student 
arena— because that's 
what Ulmer always fought 
for as the student's repre- 
sentative. 

Please consider that last 
phrase: "the students he 
was supposed to repre- 
sent," How many admin- 
istrators really view 
themselves as representa- 
tives of the students? In- 
stead, it seems, IPFW 

administrators sometimes 
view working with stu- 
dents as just part of a 
routine. II was something 
they have lo do. and it was 
a way lo earn a paycheck 
Some of Ihose people are 
gone this year, and IPFW 
might be belter for it. But 
Ulmer will definitely be 
missed by the students. 
He'll be missed because 



he knew his job and h^ 
knew IPFW The slim; 
well-dressed, while-haired 
man who took the lime la 
listen lo students' com-| 
mcnts and needs and in 
turn addressed theso 
needs to the upper echeloij 
of IPFW no longer sits iij 
a position where he can 
give sludenls a direct Iin4 
to the chancellor. ; 

The saddest thing aboul 
it is, the people who askej 
him to leave will never 
believe a word I just 
wrote. They'll be so van^ 
(or possibly feel so 
guilty?) as lo think the 
purpose of this commen- 
tary was (o talk about 
them. 

But what can you expect 
from an adminislration 
that asked for the resig- 
nation of a dean of stu- 
dents who bucked the sys- 
tem, fought for the un- 
derdog, had 23 years ol 
experience a I the Fort 
Wayne campus, and made 
it a point to get to know 
the students he served? 

When the IPFW admin- 
istration changed the locks 
on Jack Ulmer's office 
door, IPFW turned iU 
back on the best friend it 
had. It booted out the 
strongest man who always 
fought at the front line for 
students.

So. I 



ailed 



friend of mine. Holly 
Miller, and asked if she 
would like to co-author a 
myslery-romance novel 
with me under a pen 
name. II took us nearly a 
year to write "The Legacy 
of Lillian Parker" because 
we developed several in- 
irjcale subplots for (he 
book. When we sold it to 
Harvest House Publishers. 



It l»ecame a big hil We 
Ihen signed a contract 
which called for us lo 
write Ihree sequels Sud- 
denly, we became deeply

ing" 

Miller is an assistant 
professor of journalism at 
Anderson College and 
former senior editor of the 
Saturday Evening Post 
By Liking H-O-L from her 
name Holly and D-E-N 
from Henslcy's name 
Dennis, they created the 
pen name of Holden 
Hensley said, "If you 
break the four syllables of 
the name apart, you get 
the message thai it's less 
of a lie to admit we're Hoi 
and Den." 

Al first. Harvest House 
Publishers kept Holden's 
identity a secret. How- 
ever, after the Chicago 
Sun-Times gave "The 
Legacy of Lillian Parker" 
a four slar review, re- 
quests came In hoi and 
heavy for Leslie to appear

"We've had a lot of

Proposals to increase loans 



Making more money 
available for student loans 
and grants is the goal of 
two bills supported by 
Republican Slate Repre- 
sentatives Barbara Engle, 
Phyllis Pond and Richard 
Worden. 

The first bill. Senate Bill 
370, updates the guidelines 
of the Secondary Market 
for Guaranteed Student 
Loans Id make more loans 
available. 

"The Secondary Market 
is a nonprofit corporation 
created by the state to 



enable 
slitutions to provide more 
student loans. This is ac- 
complished by buying 
student loans from the fi- 
nancial institutions allow- 
ing the institutions lo re- 
use Iho money for a sec- 
ond or third student loan." 
Pond said. 

Currently, the Second- 
ary Market has purchased 
nearly S400 million in 
loans But Engle said 



Senate Bill 370 would 
make the program even 
more successful by im- 
plementing the following 
changes: 

- The Secondary Market 
could deal wilh Indiana 
hanks whose headquarters 
are in an adjoining stale. 
This change is needed be- 
cause Indiana allows in- 
terstate banking, 

- Financial institutions 
could loan students money 
they borrow from the 
Secondary Market, creat- 
ing another source for 
student loans 

- An emergency pro- 
gram would be established 
to provide loans directly to 
the student if financial in- 
stitution would not grant 
the loan. To be approved, 
the loan would have to be 
discussed with the in- 
stitution and approved by 
the governor. 

- If the program is ever 
dissolved, leftover money 
would return to Ihc slate. 



- Another bill supported 
by Ihe Republican law- 
makers allows the Stale 
Student Assistance Com- 
mission to accept dona- 
tions for student grants. 
The commission presently 
makes about 31,000 grants 
each year. 

Senate Bill M3 enables 
Ihe SSAC to accept S50 
million from the Eli Lilly 
Foundation lo subsidize 
the grants. Worden ex- 
plained the Lilly money 
would supplement about 
4,000 grants each year 

Also provided tor in the 
bill, the SSAC would be 
able lo accept future do- 
nations for granUi as they 
are approved by the gov- 
ernor and the Slate 
Budget Agency. 

Both bills passed the 
House March 30; Senate 
Bill 370 by a 96-3 vote and 
Senate Bill 433 by a 99-0 
vole. The bills now go lo 
Governor Orr for his 
signature.

Review 



Have you noticed that 
every movie released this 
summer has been ad- 
vertised a '"musl-see"? 
Unfortunately most of 
these were not worth was- 
ting time (and money) on. 
So after a summer of the- 
ater [jascoes, it was with 
reluctant hear! that I 
crawled into Southtown 
Theater to witness what I 
was sure would be another 
Hollywood screw-up 

The movie "No Way 
Out" stars Gene Hackman 



and a newcomer to the 
silver screen, Kevin 
Costner This did abso- 
lutely nothing to t&gt;oost my 
flagging confidence in the 
movie industry. 

What a shockl "No Way 
Out" did not claim to be

summer." It 
movie ot the summer. And 
more. It was brilliant arid 
compelling and believe- 
ablc. It had only a tew 
problems, making it hard 
(0 review without giving 
the ending away. 

Another problem is it's 
slightly exploitative. Ot 
women, ot course The" 
only woman in the movie 



is used merely as a sex 
object and nothing else. 
Within twenty minutes of 
the start she had hopped 
into the backseat of a limo 
with Tom Farrel. our 
heroC^I. I will not go into 
graphic detail about what 
happened there; lei it suf- 
fice to say 1 was licginning 
to believe this was just 
another tacky sex movie 
when the producers 
gracefully shifted to an- 

Withoul giving anything 
away 1 can tell you what 
the movie was not. It was 
not a stupid summer 
comedy relying on well- 
known names to sell tick- 



ets (like "Dragnet") It is 
not based on a cartoon or 
comic strip (like "Mas- 
ter's of the Universe"). 
And it isn't a blood and 
gore movie kilUng people 
because it doesn't know 
what to do with them (like 
"Friday the 13 Part '" 



what is it? Elghf If you want mcaningle^ 

The producers and di- laughs and stupidity,

Jazz returns to Foellinger 



Foellinger Theatre 
hosted a Big Jazz Band 
Concert Tuesday night. 
The concert was one of 
four performed throughout 
the year. 

John Branum directed 
the concert which featured 
the sounds ot the iWO's 
ja?? music. Branum 
directs two of the concerts 
each year and Dick Seger 



direcls the other two. 

There are fourteen 
pieces in the group and 
Bob Bear, manager of the 
theatre, states that a tew 
ot the fellows in the band 
are old enough to have 
been around in the 40's 
and remember the origi- 
nal band sounds 

Branum's band also has 



a vocalist, whereas Seger 
has strictly music. 

The concert features 
music of Tommy Dorsey, 
Harry James, and Glen 
Miller. 

Dick Seger has been 
presenting jazz music at 
Foellinger Theatre tor 
twenty years and Branum 
has been there tor ten. 



Artlink will be opening 
its latest show on Satur- 
day, Sept. 5 The new 
"Dimension Eight" ex- 
hibit is one ot the biggest 
shows Artlink has ever 
had The show will be so 
big some ot the work will 
tie exhibited outside of the 
center. 

Dale Enochs will be the 
curator of the show. En- 
ochs is an artist who spe- 
cializes in sculpture 

'■This show," slates 



Enochs, "is an overview 
of different ways of think- 
ing and doing. Sculpture is 
no longer an object -based 
discipline . but a very ex- 
pansive form." 

Enochs works mostly in 
stone, and is commis- 
sioned for pieces by both 
private and corporate 

"Sculpting is very labor 
intensive,'" he states "The 
quicker you can work, the 
more fluid your ideas 



stay Extraneous pres- 
sures attect the work aiij]

need to grow out of your 



adolescence. 

I'm really surprised to 
do a review tor a new 
Fleetwood Mac album. I 
thought these guys broke 
up! Well, after god knows 
how many years in the 
making, they have finally 
put away their differences 
and cranked out "Tango in 
IheNighli' 

For starters. Fleetwood 
Mac really went for a 
■■modern" sounding 
album, yet it's still the 
same old Mac. The 
trademark voices are still 
there, accompanied by a 
little too many synths for 
my pleasure, but it doesn't 
sound bad; some of them 
are very tastefully done. 
Stevie Nicks voice sounds 
good, but the tune just 
dies around her, Christine 
McVie's efforts on this LP 
are respectable, producing 
a couple of nice, moving, 
up-beat ditties. 

Overall the album 
moves at a nice pace, the 



songs evenly interspersed 
by the various different 
singers. Side one kicks off 
with "Big Love*' which the 
radio is already killing 
One of Stevie's better 
songs, "Seven Wonders" 
follows. From there side 
one tails oft a bit. Side two 
picks up a little bit more, 
but soon gets mellow and 
introspective. 

■'Rumors" this isn't, but 
it is a good piece of work, 
and as a Fleetwood Mac 
fan. T enjoyed (his album. 
The instruments are very 
good, the voices superb, 
and the lyrics interesting, 
if a little weak. Lindsey 
Buckingham, after hear- 
ing the final cut of the 
album, decided it wasn't 
what Fleetwood Mac 
should be producing for a 
new LP, so they re-did it 
entirely. One has to 
wonder if maybe he had 
the album a little over- 
produced. I'll leave it up 
for you to decide. *'• (out
