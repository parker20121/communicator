card valid nationwide on a variety of services 
and retailors will soon be available to students. 

The Student Advantage Card is good at 
■r 20,000 locations nationwide for discounts 
and special purchasing deals and can also be 
used as an AT&amp;T calling card, if chosen to be 
activated for the calling card service. 

"The biggest pro to using this new type of 
student discount card is the fact that it has 



Corson, IPSGA vice president. 
Some of these retailers include American 

Eagle Outfitters, Footlocker, Choice Hotels

IPSGA has been working on obtaining the 



tudem Advantage Card since the 
1599 spring semester and students 
can expect to be able to obtain the 
card very soon at booths throughout 
the campus. 

"We have tried to look at this 
from the student's perspective and 
i that angle, there are no disadvan- 
ising this card," said Corson. 
Local businesses will also be offering dis- 
for IPFW students, however their par- 
ticipation has not yet been 
finalized. 

The student advantage cards are free to 
students if they sign up for the calling card 
service. If a student chooses not to activate the 
calling card service, the cards can be obtained 



for S20. Despite this cost, Corson Is confident 
about the new discount cards and hopes stu- 
dents will give them a try. 

"The old student discount cards weren't 
working, so in order for us to succeed in using

Students will need proof of their IPFW 
enrollment and also photo Identification to get

the basement of Kettler where students can

Student IDs to include 
photos, new barcoding 



by CarrieAnne Leathers, 
News Editor 



After learning earlier 
this year that the Identifica- 
tion card readers In Gates 
Sports Center were not going 
to be Y2K compliant, the uni- 
versity began looking at new 
student ID possibilities and 
finally chose to go with 
photo identification, 

"This new card has a lot 
of possible capabilities and 
the university is looking at 
many different applications 
for the card," said Dan 
Gephart, business manager 

Walb Union and student 
organizations. 

Although Gephart had 
been trying to get photo IDs 
for students for many years. 
It was unlikely to occur until 
recently when technology 

"I've been pushing for a 
long time to get a photo ID 
and part of my success was 
because the 
cost of doln

ur barcode 
for the library," 
Gephart said. 

Another advantage 
to the new ID Is that 
students will no longer 
need to revalidate it 
each semester because 
the card will automati- 
cally be validated once 
students have regis- 
tered and paid.

Front drive remodeled 



by CarrieAnne Leathers, 
News Editor 



After nearly 30 years, the front drive 
around Kcttler Hall was redone over the sum- 
mer, improving safety for pedestrians parking by 
the building and the flow of traffic. 

"People had to cross through traffic to get to 
Kettler and we decided that was not a good 
Idea," said David Daniclson. Director of the 



Physl

"We a

because there Is a lot more bus traffic 

In the past, cars could not get around them." 

A sanitary sewer line running from under 
Kcttler towards Ivy Tech was also replaced while 
the road was torn up and another area along 
South Drive was widened. 

Other significant changes also took place

terns in Kettler and Walb Union were made In 

order to improve energy efficiency, as well as renovations In 

the north and east » ings of Kettler Hall. 

"We arc still renovating the north wing of Kcttler and 
upgrading the classrooms there to current standards." 
Danlelson said. 

Once renovations In the east wing of Kettler arc finished, 
Continuing Education and student testing areas will be 
moved there from Walb Union. 

Air conditioning installment In the Gates Sports Center 
fitness center and weight room will likely be complete by the 
end of this week and the roof of Gates Is planned to be 
replaced next March or April. 

The fourth floor or Helmke Library was also renovated 
and should be finished by Sept. 15 with the addition of a 
new science library. 

"We've really been trying hard to get things put back 
together before students came back," Danielson said. 

This fall, a large new entrance sign, possibly brick or 
limestone, is planned to be constructed. Signage throughout 
campus directing students, faculty, employees and visitors Is 
also going to be replaced with newer and better signs. 





Students, stall and 
visitors are now 
able to park on the 
sidewalk side of 
the drive in front of 
Kettler Hall. Other 
remodeling efforts 
during the summer 
include Improved

rooms In Kettler 
and Neff halls.

Within the last few weeks 
of summer, IPFW students have 
been receiving mall from 
Information Technology 
Services (ITS) marked 
"IMPORTANT*, IPFW Student 
Computing Account 

Activation." Everyone his seen 
the envelope and most of you 
have already used [he Informa- 
tion Inside. This information 
gives Insiruciio 



i that 



via 



allow use of open i 
IPFW. 

Although it took 
S190,000 and [wo years of 
planning to create this system, 
■-: must say. hallelujah!!! ITS 
s been working on the tech- 
nical aspects since March. 
Thank you, It is about time. 

Open access computer 
labs have been at IPFW since 
1983, according lo Mary 
Schooler, manager of user sup- 
port at ITS. However, the log 
on ID Is a new requirement at 
IPFW. The computer has great- 
ly evolved since then. Today 
we have a resource called (he 
Information superhighway, 
also known as the Internet. 
Why take 20 minutes when 
you can took something up In 
five minutes? 

attitude is held by 
many people; therefore, a com- 
puter with Internet access that 



can be used without some type 
of password is a hot Item. 
IPFW computer labs have had 
Internet access since May of 
1995. Until now. the only way 
to monitor who was using the 
computers was to see a student 
Identification card. 

This method has allowed 
anyone from anywhere use of 
the labs. 

According to Sc-hoelcr, 
any Internet access should be 
secured to a known person 
with a known Identity. In 
other words, the person's iden- 
tity should be "tied" to the 
computer. If someone is doing 
something illegal, the network 
provider can take away the 
Internet privileges of the viola- 
tor. Until now, ipfw could be 
traced, but a single individual 

That Is a bit scary if you 
consider how long this campus 
has gone on without this type 
of protection. It is a good feel- 
ing to know that not Just any- 
one can stroll into our labs 
anymore. 

According to Robert 
Kosturbanlc. director of ITS, an 
Incident occurred in which 
someone conducted scams 
from an IPFW computer. There 






this

computers Is a[ Hclmke 
Library- By October first, those 
who are not students will only 
be able to access the Internet. 
Yes, these Individuals are also 
required to have a password. 

ITS also has the power to 
monitor which programs are 
used most often. Monitoring 
which programs we frequently 
use helps ITS know which 
tools to purchase. 

A warning to all, IT you 
send anything threatening via 
IPFW c-mall, the recipient can 
print out the message and turn 
you In to the dean nf students. 
The identification of the 
author and what computer was 
used Is present In the message 
header. Keeping this In mind, 
one might want to read the 
code of ethics In the Student 
Handbook. 

Obviously, IPFWs comput- 
ers were not always used for 
their Intended purpose: to 
serve as a tool for college stu- 
dents. People who were not 
students used the computers 
and sometimes the Internet 
was abused. We hope that the 
new accounts will give students 
more "computer time." 

Bravo for the new pass- 
words. They are a goad addl- 

problems. 



LETTER TO THE EDITOR 



Student praises columnist 



Dear Communicator Staff, 

Kudos to Darcl L Denton for an extremely well-written 
commentary in the July 29 edition of The Communicator. 
Without comparison, this article (-Why did we come here, 
anyway?") Is the bes[ I've read In The Communicator since 
my first semester of classes at IPFW in 1996. The author's 
point of view is right on target with Its critical assessment of 
Americans' obsession with accumulating "stuff." 

Not only arc our living rooms, closets, and garages 
overflowing with "stuff," but now we can rent, for a monthly 
fee, storage cubicles in which to store the "stuff" that threat- 
ens to devour our living spaces. Truly, our preoccupation 
with collecting "stuff" and other useless junk impoverishes 
us spiritually and intellectually. 

So, why should we strive to amass more -stuff?" Look 
into the future. Does anyone really want to spend a valuable 
Saturday holding a garage sale to try to sell "stuff" (for pen- 
nies on the dollar) that we didn't really need in the first 
place, when we'd rather be relaxing or spending time with 
friends and family? 

In accordance with Denton's outlook, I would exchange 
what little "stuff" I won (by American standards, anyway) 
for a lifetime of good health and happiness with my wife. 

Denton also emphasizes the importance of thinking for 
oneself and not Just blindly Imitating peers. Former 



University of Chicago history' professor Daniel J. Boorstin 
explores America's propensity for Intentional self-deception 
in his book "The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in 
America." In it, he describes at length how the image of 
something becomes more important to us than what it might 
have originally stood for. 

By way of illustration, Boorstin asserts that when we 
view an advertisement, we care not so much about whether 
It is factually true, but whether it is plausibly true. In sum, 
we're willing to Tool ourselves into believing something is 
genuine as long as it maintains the appearance of credibili- 
ty- Likewise, many of us assume we're being outrageous 
and original when we sport our new "Big Johnson" t-shirt 
(or tatioo/body piercing) around town, when the truth is 
that hundreds of thousands of other people are being Just as 
"outrageously original" at [he same time.. 

In closing, I'd like [o express my congratulations to The 
Communicator for a marked Increase in quality over the 
past several months and my hope for future articles by 
Darcl L Denton. Good luck in fall '99! 

Sincerely, 

John Koenig

Small Steps to Freedom 



by Darci L. Denton, Staff Writer 




My heart mus[ be tired all the time. 
This obsession with smoking is slow- 
ly killing me and that scares [he hell 
I'm learning to 



lets 



! life. 



I smoke like a fiend: two packs 
or more a day. Thai's an average of 
five or six dollars a day. Thaf s about 
S150 a month or roughly $1800 a 
year. Among other things, cigarettes 
have taken control of my cash flow. 

1 feel ridiculous writing this. 
More and more often my smoking 
habit causes me shame. I'm ashamed 
of consciously harming my body and 
spending my hard-earned money to 
do II I'm ashamed of letting some- 
thing take such control of my life. 
I'm ashamed that I can't walk a half 
block from my house to buy ciga- 
rettes without taking cigarettes with 
me. I go nowhere w|[hout my 
cigarettes. 

My cigarette habit has taken 
control of my better Judgment The 
longer I smoke, the worse it seems to 
get. It even seems to me that the 
more laws that are passed against 
smoking, the more I want to smoke. 
There are at least half a dozen new 
restaurants that 1 haven't tried yet 
due to their policy on smoking- I've 
even left some of my favorite eater- 
ies In the dus[ (so to speak) because 
they opted for a completely non- 
smoking atmosphere. This Is a scary 
sign to a girl who loves to cat. 

1 started smoking full-time when 
I was about thirteen. I'm 37 now, so 
do the math. I've smoked Tor most of 
my life; nearly two-thirds of 1l 

My lungs must be buckets of tar. 



Other things have held me pris- 
oner. I used to drink like a fish, but I 
somehow wrestled free from that 
demon. It took all the strength I had 
to put it down, but when I'm really 
ready, I can do anything. I think that 
the biggest reason I ended my long- 
time relationship with booze was 
because I wanted full control of my 
life. 1 think cigarettes, although I 
smoked all along, have taken over 
some of the alcohol's old territory In 
my psyche: 1 feel even more depen- 
dent on them now' than I ever did, 
and I seem to be hanging on to them 
as my last physically damaging 
habit. 

There Is a place in all our minds 
that Is so free and so powerful that If 



» It, \ 



i do 



anything. I found that place when 
quit drinking, but I haven't been 
able to find my way back there since 
then. Did I get there by accident 
before, or did 1 go willingly and con- 
sciously? I tend to lean toward the 
latter and I believe that says some- 
thing about the way I feel about 
myself. I think it reflects the fact that 

I believe that I have 

ultimate control ovi 
what I do, and thi__ 
the control I seek lies 
within me and that 
need look no further. 
Dcpartmem 
stores and pharmacies 
are full or "stop smol 
log" gimmicks. W 
have gum and patchi 
and pills and placcbt 
(mouthpieces to suck 
on) and still I sit here 
and smoke my life 



prescription for the pills from my 
doctor once, but 1 ended up throw- 
ing it away. I made excuses about not 
being ready to quit I was also secret- 
ly a little afraid or what the pills 
might do to my brain chemistry. 
Gather that: Afraid of pills from a 
doctor (I feel another story coming 
on!), but seemingly unafraid of the 
multiple dangers related to smoking. 
Humans are hilarious sometimes. 

Let me light a cigarette so I can 
collect my thoughts. Okay, that's bet- 
ter. 

The first time 1 said that I would 
quit smoking, I was In my late twen- 
ties and 1 chose my 30th birthday as 
my quit date. Still smoking on my 
30th, I set my next date for my 35ih 
birthday. Since I've already shared 
my age, you may logically conclude 
that my next quit date will be my 
40th birthday. Initially It was, but 
lately I've been thinking that there is 
no better time than the present. 
Nineteen ninety-nine Is. to be my 
year, but since I'm not In the habit of 
starting many things early, I don't 
imagine that I'll be In a position to 
give a "yea" or "nay" until around 
New Year's Eve. 

I grew up around heavy smokers 
and can distinctly remember the 
sound of their coughing. I cough like 



that now. I remember the adult 
smokers in my family becoming 
short of breath from minimal activi- 
ty. I lose my breath like that now. 1 
remember the panic they displayed 
when they were out of smokes, the 
cigarettes for breakfast (don't forget 
the coffee!), and the smoke-filled 
kitchens where they gathered to 
interact I do these things now. 

Before I ever smoked my first 
clgarene, I had been sent to the store 
by relatives on more occasions than I 
can count to replenish their stock. It 
has only been In recent years that 
minors have been barred from pur- 
chasing cigarettes. It was common 
practice when I was growing up for 
parents to send their kids to the 
store for cigarettes. The "strict" 
places merely required a written 
note from an adult giving a kid per- 
mission to make the purchase. Boy, 
how times have changed! 

I have several reasons Tor wanti- 
ng to stop smoking. My health and 
finances aside, it all comes back to 
control for me. Cigarettes control my 
life and limit my abilities. If I am 
ever to be all that I can be, then ciga- 
rettes cannot be a part of my life. I'm 
tired of carrying them around and 
I'm tired of the way they make my 
clothes smell. I'm tired of tasting like 



an ashtray and watching my dog get I 
down off my lap when he sees me '. 
light up. I'm tired of not having ; 
energy and avoiding activities that I ■ 
enjoy because of my addiction. ' 

1 used to run track as a teenager 
and I'll never know Just how far I ] 
might have gone had I not smoked i 
cigarettes. I miss running and 1 miss ! 
having control of my life. I miss tak- ] 
ing deep breaths and swimming long ■ 
distances under water. Just one thing I 
stands In my way and I believe that | 
this Is only because I allow it. 

Ultimately, It Is up to me, and 
me alone, to kick this terrible habit : 
No one has the power to make me ; 
stop but me. I'm working on finding '■ 
a place in my mind that Is free and '. 
powerful. I'm working on finding me. | 

Some people say that admitting | 
that you have a problem is the first ' 
step In solving it. If this Is true, then 
I have been stuck on "step one" for ; 
far too long. "Step two* must be the i 
willingness to try to change In the ! 
face of what sometimes seem to be ', 
Impossible odds. I'm not sure Just ; 
how many steps there are, but I'm ■ 
willing to bet that small steps turn '■ 
into big ones. I'm also willing to bet 
th.it I can do It If I truly desire free- ; 
dom and self-control, I'll take thai 
first small step. ;

August 19, 1999 7:30 a.m.: Alarm 

goes off. I stare at the blaring red numbers, 
cursing their existence. It's been a long time 
since I've had to use an alarm. My six-week-old 
daughter provides all the morning alarm thai 1 
need. Roll out of bed and give her and her 
daddy a kiss, choking back the tears. He packs 
her up In her car scat and takes her to his 
mother's. I watch them drive up the road and 
get dressed for our first big adventure away 
from our daughter. 

8:44 a.m.: My husband finally gets back 
from dropping Cam! off at his mother's. We 
pile Into the car, sans baby for the first time 
ever, and drive. I whip out my trusty CRli- 
preparalion book and start doing practice test

I do one section at a time, checking my 
answers in that section before moving on. I 
learn that, duh, I am pretty good at the verbal 
and analytical sections, ir I had done badly, 
probably would have spent the whole car trip 
reconsidering my choice of vocation. Reading 
voraciously has been good to me. 

9:30 a.m.: Decide that 1 am an Idiot 
when it comes to geometry. To be quite honest, 
I'm not really all ih.it excited about what times 
v In the square root of vy over xr will make r 
equal 9; I guess that someone somewhere (call 
him the "GRE God") likes to play cruel jokes 
with people like me. 

Remember how very much I hated geome- 
try when I took it as a freshman in high school. 
Realize that 1 still despise It ten years later. 
Decide that if 1 want to appear as anything less 
than mathematically inept when Purdue looks 
at my GRE scores, I had better refresh my 
memory, and refresh it quickly. Resolve to do 



with the correct 
very quantitative question tnat 1 get wrong. I 
declare that 1 am because 1 am doing so poorly. 
9:50 a.m.: Declare that I miss my daugh- 
ter. Look out the window so my husband 
does not see tears in my eyes. 

11 a.m.: Arrive in Wcs 
Lafayette. Feel really old. Six y 
ago, I was a frosh here. Now 1

bering how we fell in love at Purdue. Talked 
about our first date. Remember the first time 1 
met my husband's friends. 

Called my mother-in-law to check up on 

my baby girl. My mother-in-law sounds 

exhausted. Feel guilty for putting her through 

such a long day. Listen to highlights of my 

daughter's day without me. 

"ate every minute of the discussion 
because I want to be with my daugh- 
ter. Decide never to leave her again. 
Decide thafs a hasty decision. Get off 
the cell phone before 1 start crying. 

2:15 p.m.: My mother and I 

mmlserate while my husband helps 

my brother get checked in. Mom and I 

■ we're both leaving our babies for 

the first lime today. Try to keep my

3 p.m.: 

Start telling my 
brother every- 






who's dead. Feel old. Feel depress 
where my husband proposed to 
again. 

2:10 p.m.: My mother and brother final- 
ly arrive. Husband and I have been sluing on i 
bench in front of his dorm for an hour, 



5 p.m.: Silently put away my 
brother's possessions while my husband and 
brother put together a loft. My mom just sits 
on the bed, looking really lost. Decide to orga- 
nize his shelves to keep from bursting into 
tears. Notice that my brother brought a Bible 
with him. Find that interesting, but comforting. 
Hope that he won't be lonely or scared. Feel 



stupid for worrying about him. Miss my daugh- 

6:30 p.m.: Write "Good luck, Ben! Go 
Boilers!" on his dry-erase board. Hope he 
doesn't think it's stupid. Really want to write, 
"To my Favorite Brother: I'll miss you. Love, 
Your Favorite Sis." Laugh because I can get 
away with this: I'm his only sister. 

Realize that my other brother may get 
pissed if he hears about this. Better not write 
what 1 really want to write. Too sappy, anyway. 
Can't make Ben look like a wimp in front of his 
potential dorm-friends, anyway. Still, It feels 
weird to be leaving him there. 

6:45 p.m.: We all walk with Mom to her 
truck. My husband and 1 decide that wc should 
follow her part of the way home because she 
looks upset. Whisper to brother that he should 
give Mom a hug. Mom tries to pretend that 
she's okay, but I can see thai she's about to cry. 
My husband and 1 say our goodbyes to Ben and 
make an excuse about getting our car so that 
Mom and Ben can be alone for a few minutes. 

We walk away in silence. I don't want to 
look back because 1 know that I'll cry. Can't 
Imagine how hard it is for Mom. Miss my 
daughter. Realize how fast time passes. Fear 
the day when I'll move my daughter Into the 
dorms (at Purdue, or course). Worry about my 
baby brother being alone. 

7 p.m.: Have too much time to think 
because traffic is backed up on the east side of 
campus. Wish Mom would have taken the 
faster way, but she doesn't know the shortcuts 
like we do. Realize that Ben will be okay. I 
decide that I've got to let him grow up. Mom let 
me grow up. Know that I've got to let my 
daughter grow up, too. 

8:15 p.m.: Realize that brother won't be 
dropping by our house all the rime anymore. 
Will miss that, even though we just argue the 
whole lime. 

10:02 p.m.: Rush Into my in-law's home 
and kiss my sleeping daughter again and again. 
Am glad that I won't have to go through what 
my Mom's going through lor IB years. 

10:30 p.m.: Decide that looking back- 
ward helps me find perspective. However, it's 
time to move on, and not be afraid of the 
future. My little brother is all grown up now. 
So am I. Moving forward is a challenge, but a 
good one. I've done pretty well so far. So will 
he. Suddenly feel like I can handle anything— 
even geometry questions on the GRE.

link, I'd say about 



Brumbclae has exhibited his 
work In Sicily twice as a result 
of his friendship with Mania 
and Cup peri. 

Brumbeloe said that he Is 
"most pleased that Gianni and 
Giuseppe will be present for 
the opening* on Aug. 27 from 
7 to 9 p.m. at Artlink. "This is 
the first time these three 
artists have shown together.* 
stated Fishman, "and it Is the 
(irst time the two artists from 
Sicily have been to the United 
Slates." 

The photographs ronslst 
mainly of Sicilian architecture, 
landscapes and people that 
the artists have encountered 
in their travels. 

Fishman explained that, 
although Mania and Cupperl 
are new to the United Slates. 



they are well known photogra- 
phers in their own country. 

Cupperi has been taking 
photographs for over twenty 
years. Early in his lire he said 
that he realized the Impor- 
tance of "the language of pic- 
tures" to the way he viewed 
the world. Along with his artis- 
tic photography, Cupperi has 
worked as a professional free- 
lanre photographer shooting 
eier&gt; thing from advertise- 
ments to weddings. 

The subjects or Mania's 
phutos arc primarily the peo- 
ple, seascape and land near 
ftagusa. his native city. Mania 
has been Involved with the an 
of photography since 1989 
and has been in several 
exhibits in Sicily. Rome. 
Venice and Milan, as well as 




ional exhibit: 
France. Malta and London. 
Mania said that, as a Sicilian, 
he Is 'removed both physical- 
ly and Intellectually from 
many photographic move- 
ments," but he believes this 
isolation has allowed him to 
work on his own Individual 
creative process. 

Tim Brumbeloe is a Fort 
Wayne native with over 12 
years or commercial photogra- 
phy experience, lie has decid- 
ed to commit all of his time 
and energy to his fine art pho- 
tography which has been quite 
successful. Brumbeloe has had 
several national and interna- 
tional exhibitions of his work. 

The diverse work of these 
three photographers will sure- 
l&gt; leave something or Sicily's 
"intimate spaces" with all who 
come to see this unique exhl- 



Commission. This particular 
show Is sponsored by the 
Tokhelm corporation. 

Artlink is open to the

Dissonance and Delight from Trans Am 
and Jim O'Rourke 



by Brian Lindquist, 
Guest Writer 



-Futureworld," on Indy label Thrill 
Jockey is a dissonant journey Into the 
heart of electronic music. The cover 
art, sporting Atari Inspired Tron-llke 
graphics, couldn't be more misleading. 
As 1984 as the album looks and 
sounds, Its overall musical concept 
Is firmly rooted In the present. Trans 
Am has constructed an album that lies 
outside the normal realm of electroni- 
cally Influenced music. "Future World" 
holds the listener captive with a 
strange pulsing bass line that explodes 
Into a heavily distorted guitar melody. 
•Television Eyes." utilizing the 
vocoder, a genuine piece of 80s cul- 
ture (think Kraftwcrk)"Cocalne 
Computer," complete with electronic 



drums borrowed from the New Kids, Is 
fortified with a bass line that would 
make Tone Lot say "Wild Thing!" 

"Futureworld II" Is what your

It's hard to get over how authen-

"Futureworld" is an Intelligent

21st century musicianship. Trans Am's

Ideal Husband,' 'Brokedown Palace' explore 
moral dilemmas

'An Ideal Husband' 

It was a pleasure to go to 
a movie with such witty dia- 
logue, subtle and engaging 
performances, and above all. 

Ideal Husband^, i Is i beautiful 
summer entertainment. 

Set in 1B95. the costumes 
and sets are lavish and pro- 
vide a vacation from our gar- 
ish clothes and plastic and 
neon environment. Although 
Oscar Wilde's witty dialogue 
Is a bit like a play, Lord 
Goring Is an entertaining 
character, and Rupert 
le-stealing per- 



wife turn to Lord Goring, 
their unambitious, elegant, 
witty, loyal friend for help. 
Goring, pursued and dodging 
the marriage trap, risks all to 
help his friends. He is told, 
"Looking is different than see- 
ing. And you do 



not see until you 




see beauty" and 




throughout the 








to' look' beyond 








the characters to 




appreciate them 




as they truly 


^s^rpr^^i^" 


The best 


^ilP^^ 


part of this 




film Is the 





derful picture worthy of a 
much larger audience. 

"Brokedown Palace" Is an 
cxotically beautiful and heart- 
wrenching movie unafraid to 
address the fragile question of 
trust. Perfectly cast and care- 
fully scripted. 

—-Brokedown 



Darlene and Alice face 
difficulties with the local 
police as well as language and 
cultural barriers. Their Thai values and ere

ous blackmailer Mrs. 
Chevcrly. gives one of the 
most engaging performances I 
have seen all year. Oh, how I 
love a good bad guy! 

Director Oliver Parker 
said Moore approached her 
performance as the "emotion- 
al Inner Journey" of her char- 
acter, not as the "outward 
effect she has on everyone 
else." 

Sir Jeremy Northam 
plays Robert Chlltem, a man 
held to an Ideal by his wife, 
his friends and himself. Mrs. 
Cheverly blackmails him over 
an act of youthful indiscre- 
tion and both Chlltem and his 



high moral standards and the 
characters' struggle to live up 
to them. When were honor, 
loyalty, honesty, and high 
principles a major part of any 
movie? 

Written 100 years ago, 
the play speaks of power, cor- 
ruption, perfection, and 
Ideals, It speaks well to those 
of us living In Cllntonlan

team will have to play without Johanna Hall who went down 
earlier this week. The five returning players Dawn Caryer, 
Jenna Harmeyer, Melissa George, Christina Pape and Laura

Rebecca Meyer Is the only freshmen on this year's team. Coach

Last Years Record: 27-8(14-2) 

Head Cocch: Terry Stefankiewicz 

Key Returnees: Dave Smith, Matt Hein, 

James Ryland, Nick Pendleton, Braden Butler,

Key Recruits: Ian Luya, Brian Watson, Scott 

Bailey, Mark Watson 

Team Preview: 

With IS letter-winners and seven starters returning, the 
IPFW Mastodon soccer team will once again be In the upper 
echelon of the Great Lakes Valley Conference. 

Seniors Dave Smith and Matt Hein will lead a young IPFW 
squad into the millennium. With a 12-8 record and 10-game 
home-winning streak, head coach, Terry Stefankiewicz thinks 
his 1999 team has the potential to continue that same feat this 

The mid-field has always been a key for Slefanklewlcz's 
success and he believes the 1999 season will be no different. 
Leading the way will be senior Matt Hein, who was one of the 
most formidable scorers In the GLVC in the first half of last 
year before tearing his anterior cruciate ligament. Other 
notable returning midfielders Include Junior James Ryland and 
sophomores Nick Pendleton and Braden Butler. Sophomores 
Chris Kramer. Quint Zambon, Jalmic Lauwers, Petar Ivancevic 
and Matt Rogers will all contribute this season. 

The defense will be headed up by All-GLVC and All-Mid 
East selection Dave Smith. Smith will captain a team that gave 
up only 1.9 goals per game In 1998. Along with Smith are 
junior goalkeeper Jeff Richey, who was firth In the GLVC in 
goals against In 1998, and sweeper Brian Knitter. Despite the 
loss of Adam Strack, Stefankiewicz Is certain that the strong 
play of Kevin Krouse and Will Cook will help the Mastodons put 
up a formidable wall for L999.

women's soccer program. This will be the team's Inaugural 

Coached by experienced leader Pam Lewln, fundamental 
play will be stressed and demanded this season. 

This year's team, though very young, will be the building 
block to IPFWs future as a power In the GLVC conference. 
Featuring seven freshman, the team members will do their 
share of learning. However, Coach Lewln has very high expec- 
tations for the Lady Dons this season. She plans to build a 
competitive team that will perform well In conference play 
and make the GLVC Tourney. Although there aren't a lot of 
things guaranteed in first year programs, one thing that Is cer- 
tain is that this year will be very exciting.

University, Edwardsville, both from the GLVC, faced off In the 
NCAA Division 11 Tournament. In the final game, Southern 
Indiana lost to Ashland In triple over-time for the national 
title. With a successful rccrultlng'clasicomlng'lnto- IPFW, the
