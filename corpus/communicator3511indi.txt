appeared at Ihc event. 

According to IPFW Wellness 
Fitness Cooidinaloi, Judy Tillapaugh, 
Ihc main goal of Ihc Greal American 
Smokeout is to encourage people who 
smoke to not light up and for smokeis to 
slopping forever. 



"Il is a day for people lo kick the 
habil. [I is a day for people to become 
more aware of the dangers of smoking 
and a day for people to get a.Mlslancc on 
how to stay smokeftee for life." 
Tillapaugh said. According to Ihe 
Smokefree Indiana website, cigarette 



smoking is the leading cause of death 
and disease in the United States. 
Smokers die nearly seven years earlier 
than nonsmokcis and smoking costs 
people in Indiana S54S per yeai in 
hcalth-ielaied cosu. while secondhand 
smoking kills 53.000 nonsmokcrs in die 
Unilud Static each year.

is a good idea. "Health awareness is 
required to help people quit smoking, 
however, il will only make a small dif- 
fciencc because awareness has been 
around for a long lime and people don't

Single? Want to meet that special 
someone? We all have noticed these signs 
advertising dating services suewn about 
the Fan Wayne area. Also, like the 
American Dieting Campaign, a majority of 
single persons are longing lo find that spe- 
cial someone. All too often, day-to-day 
experiences ore limited to a rigid schedule 
(hat IS not conducive to meeting potential 
dating prospects. If »e ever come across 
someone who sparks mteresl. often the 
moment passes before our eyes as a result 
of apprehension and feir. 

Last week while eating breakfast, my 
attention was divened away from my bow] 
ofCieim of Wheat, to the issue at hind on 
"(jood Morning America." Apparently, the 
woman who is creator of the television 
show. "Sex in the City." has ■invented' a 
new style of dating.

been exchanged. 

Sound a little loo systematic for your 
liking? Maybe so, however, you should 
not be so quick to knock it. Our society has 
become structured around on idea of effi- 

EfTicient cars, efficienl heaters, effi-

is the 'soccer moms" method of life and. 
after ill. the very foci Ihat the term "soccer 
mom" exists, implies (hat the existence for 
most Americans is dictated by repetitious 
activities which keep us moving from 
dawn to dusk. 

So. in theory ihe Seven Minute 
Dating eiperience sounds as if it (udily 
belongs in American society. In practice, 
will it work in a beneficial way and 
increase (he number of happy couples? 
This IS somewhat difficult to discern. 

After conducting a non- scientific 
poll of 15 single persons of a variety of 
ages, only seven said that they would take 
part in a mats mini-dating session. 
Reasons why they would participate 
included several answers.

Reasons given why those who said 
thai they probably would nol take part 
included the idea of this being a last resoil 
ond subsequently, only the desperate peo- 
ple would attend. Some felt the idea was 
allogediei ridiculous. Another interesting 

ideology relating to males. She fell that 
men would treat the gatherings as avenues 
for 'hook-ups' only.

myself, I know first hand how dinicult it

I am curious to know if Ihe Seven

institution such as a college. What do you

like diis to be worth your precious time? 
Or, do you believe this to be a pathetic

WOWO^s Dave Macy and the

IPSGA to ask Senator Mailand 
to resign. I would like tc 
encourage sludents of IPFVI tc 
ask IPSGA for Mniland^s resig- 
nation. If Senator Mailand 
refuses, then the only other 
way to get her out is to have 
200 plus students asking her to 
resign or be impeached hy peti- 
tion. The reason: As an officer 
of IPSGA her commcnis were 
Ingppropiiatc and her conduct 
in SA&amp; meetings was tnappro- 
priale. Those two inappropriate 
actions constitute ■■Conduct 
unbecoming an officer" which 
IS an impeachable offense in 
the IPSGA Constitution. 

For Senator Mailand. you 
have brought distrust artd dis- 
honor to IPSGA by your con- 
duct in the SAB meetings and 
with meetings of the Black 
Collegiate Caucus. You have 
degraded everybody and you 
have brought shame to you and
