The Student Senate met last night and 
declcd a new senator to join their ranks, 
illing one of two vacancies created last 
veck when Senators Rich Peffley and 
.arry Strong resigned. 

The new senator is Greg Lewark, 19, a 
feel 

election. "I'll try to fill the position of the 
Senate to the best of my abilites." 

The Senate, composed of 14 students, 7 
from Indiana and 7 from Purdue, voted to 
postpone a vote on the other vacancy, 
since one of the applicants was unable to 
attend. The second vacancy is on the 
Purdue faction of the Senate. 

Among other business, the hour-long

a vote of 8-1. There was much discussion 
about the appointment centering on

fley dissenting. 

The positon of secretary of the interior 
was created by Brock Able, student body 
president, last week in order m coordinate 



the unofficial efforts of Folk in that 
capacity in the past. 

Folk, after being elected, commented 
"The official title has no meaning to me. 
personally, I'll simply do my best, as I have 

The Senate also resolved to postpone 
the appointment of Saul Field as under- 
secretary of the interior in the Able ad- 
ministration, since Field was unable to

ID numbers 



BACK IN 1937. when Ihe Social Security system was horn, some suspicions 
footdraggers were convinced thai Ihe identification number imposed on covered 
workers was designed to erase individuality and create ullimalcly a nation of 
digils, not names. 

The development of ihe computer willi its capacity lor ace umu la ling and storing 
vast amounls of detailed personal information has done nothing to allay their 
fears. 

Now, prodded by increasing apprehension over citizen surveillance lied to a new 
emphasis on law enforcement during the last few years, a federal advisory panel 
has urged restrictions on Ihe use of Social Security numbers to federal programs to 
which they are essential. 

With the numbers currently demanded routinely to identify taxpayers, drivers, 
renters, students, welfare recipients, servicemen, veterans, pensioners, utility cus- 
tomers and credit applicants, (he concern is not exaggerated. 

A universal numbering system is the key to a controlled "big brother" society. 

THE EXCHANGE of information, for the time being at least, is economically 
unfeasible without the national sytem of identification by the numbers. 

Misplaced authority to use and exchange the Social Security designation, 
however, expose- the individual to a variety of abuses. 

A MASSIVE computer data hank, set up to develop dossiers on private citizens, 
could "borrow" conceivably lioni othei data banks sensitive personal information 
on such matters as an individual's driving record, his work habits, his academic 
weaknesses. Ins family problems and Ins fiscal WOCS. 

Even under the most benevolent administrator, the outlook would remain 

The committee report, prepared for the Department of Health, Education and 
Welfare, warned an "information tyranny that could lock each citizen into his 
past," signaling "the end of a uniquely American promise that (he individual can 
shed past mistakes ard entanglements and start out anew." The committee 
recommended legislation to regulate computer systems and the transfer of in- 
formation and to make files accessible lo individuals lor guidance or correction. 

HEW Secretary Caspar W, Weinberger said legislation and rceailaltonsalready 
are under consideration. 

ATER 36 years, the doubts of the apprehensive are being heard.

For this reason, each individual must do his share to keep the area looking clean. 
There is really no reason except for pure laziness for throwing trash around. 

Cleaning up one's own mess is only being fair to Ihe next person who uses the

Nixon told a London Observer reporter in 
1968. "You must fight back in life,

In the past when under attack, Mr. 
Nixon always fought back, a factor that 
accounts for his remarkable comeback in 
politics after his I960 and 1962 defeats. 

Mr. Nixon's early silence on Watergate, 
broken only by statements in March and 
May that revealed little, created the belief 
that he shared some complicity in the

that in 1968, Agnewas'"the most underes-

said, and was 'the best available man' for 
the nomination. He said he liked Agnew 
on 'city stuff,' but it was really Agnew the 

The second factor is how each man 
measures Ihe world around him and its 
worth. Mr. Nixon cares greatly about 
what others think of him; Agnew is much 
less concerned with the approval of others. 
This helps explain why Mr. Nixon is less 
personal in his dealings with people to the 
point of aloofness that provides a solitary

became vice president.

To the Editor: 

Due to the pressing problems connected 
with the beginning of another term, it was 
impossible for us to reply to Mr. Merica's 
initial letter. Now we feel that this whole 
thing is getting out of hand. 

Merica refers to the long hairs of "Hip- 
pie Haven". If this is a good analogy, then 
aren't most area high schools, shopping 
centers, parks and other public places 
hang outs for "dirty long haris" also? 
Under this reasoning there is genuine need 
for Mr. Merica's concern since many of

Everyone is a fan. You find football fans, hockey fans, basketball fans, lennis fans, and 
even chess fans; but none can compare to a baseball fan. How can you spot a baseball Ian'.' 
Well, you can't on the street — the only way is lo attend a game. There it is easy to locate the 
different types of fans. 

The first type of fan is the "True Blue Fan" (not to be assocated with Vida Blue). He is 
usually a middle-aged man who "lives and dies" as his team wins and loses. He is a box seal 
ticket holder, owner of a color TV and lounge chair (so he doesn't miss his (earn in action 
during road trips). He is heard to say, "1 don't care what happens as long as we win." 

The second category of fan is ihe "Oldlimer Fan", who is around sixty or seventy years 
old. He is often accompanied by a young child (age 9-10). He is immediately recognized

Group number three is called the"Ballgamc Beer Fan", 
in intoxicating beverages during a game — in other word 
can be found by the empty beer cups around his feet. He will cheer for b 
during the sevenih inning stretch (in which he remains sealed for fear of losing balance). He 
can be heard saying, "Hey, where'd the field go?" 

The "Inquisitive Wife" is the fourth category. She is continually asking ridiculous ques- 
tions or making stupid statements like "Why did lhal man drop the ball?" or "Did he score a 
touchdown yet?" She is always accompanied by her husband (who is on the edge of a 
nervous breakdown). She is sometimes heard lo say to her husband in the middle of a 
crucial inning, "Harry, do you think that woman over there is prettier than me?" 
. Next comes the "Eager Father and Disinterested Son Fan." This group consists of en- 
i tin. i.i -in. taihers who take their young son to a game for fun — only the child would r;it her
