This weekend will be (he sel- 
ling for 1-oti Wayne's sixih 
annual Race Unity Day spon- 
sored by Ihe Baha'i Community of 
Fan Wayne 

This year's ihcmc is '"Mankind's 
Diversity: Our Adonimeni," Carol 
Roberts, one of ihc organizers of the 
celebration, smd (he Baha'i faith is 
concerned with helping people rc:il- 
ize "mankind is one." 

"Ilie only hope is to unify, not lo 
become homogeneous, but lo recog- 
nize the 'one-nes5' of mankind." 
Roberts said. "The eanh is bul one 
country and mankind its citizens" 

"After this, the problems of the 
world will dis^pcar." she added 

Race Unity Day staned nationiti- 
ly in 1957 by the American members 
of the Balia'i faith. It began 
within the faith, bul has 
gradually branched 
out to the resi of 
country.

Mazloomi 
grew up in an all- 
while suburb and wresUed 
with the fact she was the only black 
person around 

She was bom into the Balia'i 
faith, but in the faidi. when you 
reach the point of maturity— 1 5. you 
arc allowed to declare what religion 
you will follow 

Children of members are 
encouraged to investigate ditTerenl 
religions. 

Mazloomian chose the Baha'i 
religion 

Her book chronicles her experi- 
ences in Africa and other places m 
the world. 




"It's a two-way process of learn- 
ing about the people you visit and 
ihey learn about you." she said. 

"I fell like it was something 1 
bad lo do. I was compelled to wnte 
the book." Mazloomian added. 

One part of the book Robcru 
said made a large impression on her 
was when Mazloomian was watch- 
ing a South African television pro- 
gram with a itmn saying that blacks 
were an inferior race, Mazloomian 
isked rhetorically. "How far have 
we progressed when we still have 
people trying to prove what is 
unprovable." 

Mazloomian left South Africa 
the day Nelson Mandela was 
released from prison. 

Mazloomian wiL be on WJFX.

'Each year |of 
Kace Unity Day) is 
belter than the year 
before. We almost 
had to turn people 
^iway this year." 
Roberts said. 

The Baha'i faith 
originated in 1844 in 
modern day Iran by a 
nobleman named 
Baha'u'ultah, which 
leans "the glory of 
in Arabic. 
What Jesus was to the 
Jewish faith, Baha'u'ullah was to 
Islam. He faced the same kind of 
perseeuiion," Roberts explained. 

Qahau'ullah was imprisoned 
for his belief that he was the 
promised one of the Muslim faith. 
Baha'u'ullah was incarcerated for 
40 ycaI^ and died in Palestine in 
18»)2. 

Baha'i believe dial all religions 
aa' one, all man is one and God is 
one

Read-A- 

Thon 



BY NOL BeCKLEV 

Acting Editor 

This summer the Helmke 
Library is holding a "Rcad-A- 
I'hon" to raise money lo maintain 
the library and to upgrade the elec- 
tronics information and education 
system. 

Suzanne Echlenkamp, a 
Helmke Library Read-A-Thon 
Committee member, said the Read- 
A-Thon was pan of a SI. 5 million 
campaign which will add to the 
library's endowment. 

Upgrading the information sys- 
tem will allow IPFW students to 
access the Allen County Public 
Library sysiem through computers 
in Helmke, fhis should enable stu- 
dents to research a subject more 
thoroughly than previously. 

"What I'm hoping for is 100 
percent cooperation from Ihe 
administration in the form of dona- 
tions or pledges." Echlenkamp said. 

People pledge a certain dollar 
amount per book (no more than 25 
bookst to readers The books can 
come from Helmke Library, the 
Allen County Library System, your 
own book shelf or a book store 

"This IS a good way for people 
10 get involved People can pledge 
so much per book or they can 
pledge a lump sum It's up to the 
person who is doing the support- 
ing, " said Laurie R. Sleinbrunner, a 
member of the Rcad-A-Thon 
Conunitlee. 

By collecting pledges or by 
pledging support readers, Ihe 
Helmke Library will hopefully 
reach its goal. 

"I think this is an easy way to 
raise funds and totally appropriate 
for a library." Echtenkamp said 



kindergancn and diey are expected 
to act as if they are in kindcrpancn. 

Certain things are retjuired of 
them, but they aren't expected to act 
as if they are in high school. Next 
the children go to first grade and are 
taught new ttimgs Bul since knowl- 
edge is progressive, they are 
required lo remember what they 
learned before. The Baha'i believe 
mankind is in the adolescent stage of 
its maturity. 

"The teachings of Baha'u'ullah 
are very timely," Roberts said, 
"Religion is revealed lo each man 
None of the spirituality changes 
only society changes." 

"Race Unity Day has a lot of 
people looking to find empathy, 
cross cultural couples etc ."

The ordinance would require landlord and icnaiil to inspect the proper- 
ty together and file information with the city's Neighborhood Code 
Enforcement department 

The task force's goal is lo make ii difficuli for someone to know which 
homes are rented and which are owner-occupied. 

Forty percent of the houses in Fort Wayne are occupied by someone 
other than Ihc owner. 

Opponents of the ordinance say it fails to address the real causes of the 
problems-ihe suburban exodus With the tougher ordinanie, opponents say, 
Uiere will be fewer landlords and therefore fewer people living in older 
communities. 



Homicides have dropped 11 percent nauonally partly due lo the end

inio Ihe NBA. it was his hard work 

and perseverance dial got him lo the 

spot that he is today — Ihe best

He was a member of the 1989 
and 1990 NBA champion team, the 
Detroit Pistons, and die 1996 NBA 
champion leam, the Chicago Bulls. 
He was an NBA All-Star in bodi 
1990 and 1992, NBA Defensive 
player of the Year m 1990 and 1991 . 

He was named to the NBA All-

Even with all ihesc accomplish-

stand E}ennis Rodman, one of die 
greatest NBA players. 

Dennis Rodman is not only a 
great basketball player, but also an 

enigmatic individual. He has "f his decision to play basketball.

He was also asked "Why do you

response to thai question was. "The 
main reason is probably because I 
won't let anyone bring me down." 

That is die reason why I like 
him. Il is also die reason why so 
many people hate him. Rodman is 
an individual who docs care what 
odiers think about him. 

In today s world, loo many peo- 
ple think diat a person has to act a 
certain way People also judge oth- 
ers on bow they look, and not on 
their accomplishments and individu- 
alism Rodman does not act that cer- 
tain way, and be dcfimiely does not 
have dial approved look. 

People need to look past die 
dyed hair, earrings and tailoos and 
look beneath die surface. Rodman is 
a sman guy. He has a brilliant bas- 
ketball mind, and best of all. he 
doesn't care what oihers think of 
him.

I am doing great. I'm feeling good choices. He is noi a follower, he is a 
leader. He is Dennis Rodman. 



Dennis Rodman has not always 
played baskelball. Rodman did not 
play baskelball as a teenager, mostly 
because of his height. He stood only 
5' 11" when he graduated from high

He worked die graveyard shift 
in the E&gt;alIas-Fon Worth Airpori ai 
the age of 70. After high school, he 
grew eight inches and decided to 
dump his job at die airpori to try 
basketball. 

He enrolled in Cooke County

Men bite, kill 

To THE EDITOR: 

Why IS It when a man is 
accused of sodomizing, and biting a 
female over a dozen tunes he can be 
allowed to telecast an NBA playoff 
game die next day afier spending 
the previous night m jail. 

How can a man he pulled over 
for drurdten driving, and only get a 
ticket, instead of having to go to 
jail, having his car towed, and dien 
having to go to couri the next day 
where mosi ld(ely bis license will be 
taken away. 

And bow can a man kill his wife 
and anodier human being and get 
away with this. 

Well the answer is simple to 
these three quesdons. Marv Albert. 
Tim Allen, and O.J Simpson 

Only in America can these 
slimy men be allowed to get away 
wiih sodomizing, drunk driving, 
and murder. 

Why is il dial when a man plays 
sports or plays widi power tools dial 
he is seen as some ultra macho man 
that can do no wrong These men 
are put on such a high pedestal, 
you'd IhirUc Ihey were God Which 
is who men bow down to on 
Monday nights during die fall, and 
Sundays dunng ihe entire year with 
the remote stuck on ESPN A net- 
work of wavelengths that hypnotize 
our men to leave died diny socks on 
the fioor and sel their gliss on the 
coffee table without a coaster. 

I was amazed ttiai Marv Alberi 
could be accused of such allegations 
and then the next day broadcast the 
game, which most of the nadon was 
watching What aboui the other 
casters, did they not spciik up and 
ask thai a man Ihai might have done 
such things the day before, not be 
present on ihe show with them? Bui 
Ihe network know men who make 
up most of their audience don't care 
and wdl continue to watch the 
show. 

Last week Tun Allen was pulled 
over for being intoxicated whde 
operating a motor vehicle. We all 
know that if il were a man who was 
not famous, he would have been 
taken to jail, had his car towed, been 
forced to appear in coun die next 
day. paid a fine plus coun costs, and 
had his license taken away But 
some cop probably plea bargained 
an autographed piaure for bis kids, 
for die Tun not going to Jail. 

Who cares if he was famous. He 
could have just as easily killed 
somebody while driving under 
these circumstances as anyone else 
We shouldn't let him off die book, 

I won't go on about OJ. and 
rehash what's been told so many 
times, but this man was finally 
found guilty, and his biggest pun- 
ishment is being kicked ofl" private 
golf courses, being forced to play 
on die L.A public courses. Oooo 
big punishment! 

So I guess it is up to the women 
in dus country to accuse diesc men, 
and boycott the shows these men 
represent, we can not allow diis to 
happen.

"I AM 

MYSELF AND 
WHAT IS 
AROUND MB. 
AND IF I DO 
NOT SAVE IT. 
IT SHALL 
NOT SAVE 
ME.' 

—Jose 
Ortega j 
Gasset I, 
■MediUtlons on Quixote," 1911 

I'll admit il — I've spent many a 
slccptc&amp;s nighl pondering the crises 
thai confroni mc every day No, not 
the little tilings (like why evay- 
thing in this wcirld is made for right 
handed peoplt) — I ponder die real- 
ly "BIG THINGS" Now iliat I'm 
mamed. I wonder what Icind of 
world that I'm going to bring chil- 
dren into, and lo be honest, il fright- 
ens mc 

The nineiiei are nearly ovei, 
and we humans face many of the 
same fears and prubtems that OLir 
parents faced \0 years ago 



Bui 10 years ago, things were 
differenL Ten years ago, I was a 
child. I was 12. The problems of the 
world didn't seem like a big deal 
then. 1 knew that they eusled; I was 
well aware of them. 

But to he honest, Ihcy just did- 
n't scare me that much These 
things seemed a world away from 
my life hca- in Indiana After all. 
they'd be all taken care of by the 
time I was an adulu right'' Right??? 
Call me naive, but that's what I 
assumed 

What frightens me and keeps 
me awake so many nights is the 
very fact thai these things haven't 
gone away. Some of these things 
have gotlcn worse. War still 
exists — many of the same ones that 
were being waged a decade ago 
Poverty is still an ever-preseni 
remuider of the American Dreams 
dial don't always pan ouL 

I&gt;rugs arc siill very much a part 
ol every lacci of our culture; in fact. 
they're becoming a more conunon 
presence every day. Murder hap- 
pens more and more, closer to borne 



every tune Hate stiJl exists — now 
in more forms than ever There are 
even new fears lo add to Ihe 
group — AIDS and environmental 
woes are adding fuel to the fire. 

The list is increasing everyday. 
None of diesc things have changed, 
none have gone away, some have 
even gotten worse 

What a horrifying realizauon to 
my now-adult mind. 1 always 
thought tliai someone, somewhere 
would 'Tix" it all before I had to 
face the reality of what's wrong 
with our world today 

But no one fixed anything. 

Our politicians spend our tax 
dollars arguing aboui how to fix 
everything, but they never really Tix 
anything. That realization has hit 
me like a ton of bricks, and it 
almost makes mc sad. It has made 
me lose a little faidi in humankind, 
loo. 

Now it's true, I can sil here in 
front of my computer and write 
about the diings that anger and 
fnghien me all day and really do 
nothing Bui I'm not going lo let 



that happen 

If 1 really wani to change die 
things that scare and homfy me, I 
need to be the one to make a 
change Whether Ihai change cwnes 
in the form of small or sweeping 
reform. I guess it's gonna have to be 
up lo me 10 initiate some change. 

My biggest hope amidst all of 
this fear is dial someone else out in 
the big mean world feels like me, 
and maybe, just maybe, together we 
can make a change 

Together maybe we can face 
those fears and stare diem down 
But whatever the case, I'm not 
gonna let another 10 years pass me 
by while these feai&gt; glow bigger 
and stronger 

In 10 years, I'll have children. 
I'llhave to explain 10 those children 
why all of die things I wanted to fix 
in the 1990s are still around lo 
fngbten them. So I'm going to take 
a stand. I'm going to make my mark 
in this world by fixing things — 

— even if I have to do it, one 
fear at a Ume 



Learning something new from someone older 



Educated blond: Dawn snarr 




When he yut m.imed I wa.s only m 
fifth gnide, nding my hike to school 
and pla&gt;ing widi my loys. When I 
graduated from high school he was 
gomg to his 10-year high school 

Here I am in love with this older 
n, and 



didn't know be was the age he is. 

Maybe Uiis is always my first 
misiake When I was 17, 1 went out 
on a date with a guy who I dioughi 
was 23 or 24. During dirmer as we 
were making small talk, he began 
telLng siones of things I knew bad 
happened long before I was bom 

I nonchalandy asked him how 
old be was Well not quite what I 
expecied, that uny Hide guess of 
mine turned out to be a real age of 
32. Yes 32. I wanted to run, I want- 
ed lo call my lilUe high school 
friends and lell them I had them all 
beat for oldest guy gone out with. I 
was stuck with diis guy who could 
have been my dad. Well, if you 
stretch it. 

The tension on die first date 
became so tense that you could cut 
il with dental floss Of course when 
he saw the disbelief in my face, he 
asked me how old I was. So I told 
him, and be too freaked out. 

I should have learned afler that. 
but I didn'L When I met diis current 
inlercsi. I should have known io ask 
for two photo IDs and a birth cer- 
tificate But we starred to talk, and I 
found an interest in him that sparked 
die flame. 

We have aboul 10 years 
between us, which to my friends 
seemed like 30, and lo my mom 
sounded like 50 My mom figured it 
was one diose things that I was 
experimenting widi. and my friends 
called lo ask me bow my sugar 
daddy and I were When we first 
went out in public, I felt like every- 
body was staring at us, wondering 
what this man was doing widi this 
kid. I wondered if Ihcy wauled lo 
give me the kid's menu, and him the 
parent's discount. 

This brings up the next point, he 
has a SIX year old son. Which is only 
14 years younger than I am. 1 really 
fell young then When all diree of us 
were m public for the first ume I 
thought people were looking ai us 
like I was the baby-sitter, or older 
daughter, or the big sister This real- 
ly made my fncnds wonder if I was 
myself, or what 1 always said 1 
never wanted kids, and here I was 
sacrificing private time, pnvale 
space, and then T V. channels for 
this six-year-old. My mom really 
about dropped the phone when she 
found out, and realized that my 
younger sister is only a gntde ahead 
of his son, and they attend ihc same 
school. Small World 

When I saw the Wedding Photo 
Album on his bookcase I really 
began lo wonder what I was doing. 
He had been there and done the 
divoree already, way beyond the 
point in which I'm at in my life. 
When be got married 1 was only in 



lurprisingly 
t has 
worked It 
took a cou- 
ple months 
to get over 
the 



Ronald Reagan and Nascar driver 
Jeff Gordon And on the other side 
of the coin I've learned diat I tiave 
to share him widi his son. and put up 
widi his unbelievably messy house 
Oh sure it isn't always peaches 
and cream I rarely get bis jokes, or

Gay men make the 
best 'girl-friends' 



In focus: Sara ValentlneM 



i 



Gay men 
make really 
great friends 
for straight 
women It's 
true All of that 
nasty male- 
female sexual 
tension is 
brushed aside 
and great friendships can develop. I 
know because I have had several 
male friends who happen lo be gay 
Ftfst. let's covCT some of the stereo- 
types. Actually, I diink dial all of the 
following scenanos involve some 
stereotype, but I can't help it In my 
expenence. many of them have 
been accurate 

Gay men are fun to go shopping 
with. Whether you're lookmg for 
bath and beauty products, a new 
bustier or cologne for your beau, a 
gay man wdl happily accompany 
you. Gay men dress really well, so 
you won't nund being seen widi 
ihem in pubUc In fact, they dress so 
well that It might give them away, 
so that you are still open for straight 
suitors. Unless, of course, diey have 
the homble and unattracuve afflic- 
uon of homophobia 

Many limes gay men love whal 
women love. Romantic evenings by 
the fireplace, flowers, wine. Mary 
Kay parties, manicures, good hair 
and men. It's a natural combination 
for us to join forces. One of my gay 
friends has a classic quote when it 
comes to men "Men are pigs. I'm 
glad I'm not one " We seem lo agree 
on diis point. I'm glad he's not too, 
or else we might not get along so 
well 

Going to gay bars is great fun 
for a woman I've found that I can 
really let loose at gay bars. Thai has 
a great deal to do widi the fact that 
die typical bar guy is missing from 
die scene. The one who watches you 
from across the room (as if you 
can't see him) and nods bis head in 
approval as he drinks watered down 
beer. I like dancing at a gay bar 
because the guys there can actually 
dance and 1 don't feel the stare of a 
million drunken eyes. Everyone 
dances at gay bars and I'm Lilking 
about "real" dancing not head nod- 
ding or jumping up and down or 
swaying which is usually the case at 



straight bars, so no one has time lo 
just slop and stare. And I'm proud to 
say thai I haven't been hit on yet! 

Gay men buy great gifts! 
Whedier it's an Orson Welles box 
set, a pedicure, a floral arrangement, 
embroidered bath towels, a first edi- 
tion novel, an espresso machine or 
home-made biscoiti and carrot cake, 
the gay man auns to please in the 
gift-giving department because, 
let's face it, diey give what diey 
would like to receive. 

"Girl talk" is never quite die 
same once a gay man is allowed to 
join. 1 have speni many nighu dis- 
cussing die attributes and downfalls 
of the testosterone earners thai we 
arc so fond of I am in agreement 
with one of my homosexual cronies 
when he speaks of "gentleman 
callers" as the ideal He might say, 
"Ah yes. 1 wish I were m the days of 
old when a genUeman caller came to 
your home and was met by your 
fadier in die parlor while you are 
still upstairs delicately powdenag 
your nose " Those were ibe days. 

To top II otT, when you confide 
in a gay man. there are none of the 
petty jealousies that occur between 
girlfnends Yes, you're compeung 
for die same sex. but not usually for 
the same person, so more time can 
be spent eyemg the merchandise 
instead of fighting for II 

Finally, I must say that although 
the gay man is not straight he is def- 
initely always very straightforward. 
He is not afraid lo lell you that ao 
outfit makes you look fat or doesn't 
maich your skin tone He is also 
very blunt when it comes to your 
choice in men A gay man is not like 
a girlfnetid who wdl tell you whal 
you want to bear Instead he will 
give you love advice from a man's 
point of view and he can much more 
easily translate a man's actions 
whether you want to hear it or not. 
Thai's right, if diere's one diing gay 
men don't do it's beat around the 
bush. 

Anyway, die moral of this story, 
ladies, is lo befnend your fellow 
men-loving, male sisters and just 
see whal happens If nothing else. 
you may just get a lovely floral 
comforter and matching sheets out 
of it. Hey girl, isn't your birthday 
coming up?

BY Dawn SHAnn 

AcTlvrPES EWTOH 



Allhough I've bten lo Cedai PoinI 
Amuscmcnl Park, one of the nabon's lop 
Atiraeiion TTiemt Paries, on several occa- 
sions, this summer's tnp was especially 
enjoyable afiei Ihc completion or finals 
week. 

For Ihc impatient lypc like me, going 
before itie high schools lei out is your best 
bci You avoid 80 percent of Ibe crowd. 
When I goi there I parked in Ibe front row of 
tbc entire parking loL Usually you're hitch- 
ing some trolley driven by a fuzzy bear wav- 
ing his arms for you to board. You're lucky 
if you even goi a glance ai die roller coasters 
clear across the parking lot 

When we enicred we all payed our S30 
dues, which is up from ihc last lime I went, 
but for die low attendance and expected 
thrills it seemed wonh it Of course, during 
youi )oumcy into the park you and your 
friends are bombarded by those annoying 
girls who hound you for a group picture. 
which no one wants beciiu-se everyone slept 
four hours on the way there and look.s like 
crap. Most of the gift shops were closed 
since this was the first week the park was 
open. Beware though the pnces on a simple 
T-shirt can run you S18-S25. 

As we marched quickly towards the Tint 
coaster we noticed many of ihe guaranteed 
winner games you pay a buck for were 
closed, along with those S4.50 bear contain- 
ers [hat hold colored sugar water. But the 
games that were open were occupied by 
bored to tears workers who desperately 
called you out in hopes of geiimg you lo 
play their impossible lo win side show. 

As we walked on the first ride, we were 
able to board immediately. 1 bate it wben I 
have to w;ul over an hour in Une for a ride 
that lasts two and a half minutes, especially 
when the line winds ibrougb acres of those 
metal poles, over which little kids smear 
Ibeir gnmy hands, and when: pre-teens lei 
their friends cut ahead in line. 

The workers who ran the nde were espe- 
cially p^ppy and fun-spmied when reading 
those famous lines about keepmg arms and 
legs inside, and no photo taking while on 
board, etc Please, at 65 miles an hour on a 
standing coa'-ter that goes upside down, do 
you think I'm thinking about taking pic- 
tures? 

The work force really needs to be 
applauded for their efforts in keeping the 
jrark very clean They were almost like 
undercover cops who lurked behind the 
bushes just waiting for someone lo throw 
down a cigarette butt The restrooms didn't 
have the usual toilet paper and feimnine 
producLs sprawled all over the floor that 



suck to your shoes. The increased 
number of reni-a -c&lt;^s preseni also 
added a sense of security to park goers. 

When in line for our second nde. my 
friend and I had been waiting in line for the 
very front when the nde broke down. Yes. 
there was a car stuck at the top of the fust 
bill Now ihLS wouldn't be so bad if it weic 
tbe first bill of the wildcat or some ride m 
Bercnsicin Bear land. This, though, was the 
Magnum which stands as tbe tallest coaster 
in the park. So as all of as gawky on-lookcrs 
oohed and ahtied at diose stuck, an employ- 
ee no taller than five feet tall walked the 
enure distance up tbe first hill. Although she 
meani well she began her trek up thai hill 
Jogging. By a third of the way. the poor girl 
was barely walking a slow pace, but eventu- 
ally she made it to die top to calm those 
stuck, and flip a few switches. You couldn't 
pay me to walk thai high up on some sec- 
through steps, with 15-mile-an-hour winds. 
The stupid diing is we decided lo wait until 
the nde was fixed, even though wc feared ii 
breaking down on us with the cars coming 
loose, tossing us mio the Great Lakes While 
the maintenance crew did get the problem 
fixed our 20-minuic wail was the longest 
one endured all day. and we were dimwitted 
enough to go on the ride immediately after it 
broke, but. hey, we're young, and our brains 
fried from finals. 

The food at ihe park was probably the 
down-side of Ihe park, I do dismiss part of 
this because of il being the fust week for the 
new chefs lo heat up cheese for the fnes, and 
throw tbosc bol dogs in a steamer, Tlits takes 
a lot of thought, maybe even a four-year 
degree lo master. O.K, so tbe cheese fries 
were cold and Ibe cheese very runny, but m 
mid-season I expect them to be a hot item. 
and well wonh tbe S2.95. The sandwiches 
which were all meat were a bit overpnced at 
S5 for a hamburger, or chicken sandwich. 
Thank goodness I don't eal meat so I saved 
quuc a bit on meal pnccs. One good poinier. 
don't overeat, or eat the chili-cbeese fnes 
before going on one of those upside down 
rides 

1 was definitely impressed with tbe park 
Tlie half hour of ram didn't even dampen 
our day, because they let (he rides continue 
lo run. 1 did miss seemg those big fuzzy crit- 
ters walk around and bug you. and they look 
out this pirate ride which was lame, but it 
was indoors and when you were cold the 
blast of hot air was comforting. One idea I 
did like was die addition of pop machines m 
die coaster lines. Each nde hal about eight 
machines of Pepsi. Mountain E&gt;ew, and even 
bottled water. 

Here in no panicular order are my views 
of Cedar Poini's roller coasters 
•The Raptor — My personal favorite li 
hangs from tbe track so that your feci dan- 



ncck, legs and bun but also your insidcs. If 
you are like me and get migraines everyday 
then do not ride this ride, you will need loLs 
of asp inn. 

•Gemini — Another wooden ride that I 
would not nde on. It is a little smooUier if 
you sit in die middle of the ride. Two cars 
run at the same lime which keeps tbe hnc 
shon, and most like diis experience of tbe 
wooden ride. 



•Mine ride- 



-A ride thai has been in the park 
re years provides no thrills for 



me. This nde gives you with a history of 
how some roller coasters have progressed 
over die years. One warning, if you are big- 
ger than a size ten in women's sizes, don't 
risk the bruises on your hips from tbe iighi 
squeeze in tbe seats 

•Wildcat — It may look like a kid's ride, but 
It really provides some miniature thrills and 
hills. It only goes about 50 miles an hour, 
but this is fast enough considenng you don't 
feel strapped m very well. 

•Blue Streak — A lesson in tbe history of 
roller coasters also, showing 
how ihey used to suck 
While it does provide a 
decent speed, and a 
good view of the 
lake harbor, it is 
hort and not 
ar ly Ihe 
xcilemeni 
of the 




glc, and you can view the ground beneath 
you. Plus it goes upside down. All these fea- 
tures create one awesome nde Just remem- 
ber to wear shoes that lie. and fii tightly 

•The Magnum — ^This is also a great nde for 
a rush on Ihe first hiU. Sitting in the from 
seat IS your best bet to see the angle of which 
you fall at speeds of over 60 miles an hour. 

•The Mantis — Another new ride lo come to 
the park, showcases itself as a coaster in 
which you stand up. whde going upside 
down. This is dirilling although those bike 
scats you squat on are uncomfortable. 

•Iron Dragon — This 
was Cedar Poini's 
first ride to hang from 
the uack. and you can 
tell- Your feet don't 
dangle; you don'i g 
upside down, but neverthe- 
less il IS a fun break from the 
ones thai drain the blood from 
your bead. During Ihe hot 
months it is also a good way 
to cool down, while pan 
of the track runs through 
misi off a pond beneath 
the ride. 

•Corkscrew — If there is a 
long Ime. do not wait for 
this nde. Yes, n is fun and 
for those who like to go 
upside down over and 
over, it is for you, but it 
lasts only a linle more 
than a minute. 

•Disaster Transport — 

This 100 is a shon ride, 
but it is inside, which 
puts most of tbe ride in 
pure darkness so ibat 
you can not see where 
ihe ride takes you This 
reminds me of Space 
Mountain at Disney 
World. 

•Demon Drop — This is ihi 
ride you don't eal befoa' 
Although this thrill lasts 
only five seconds, it is a 
close rush to free falling. 
Awesome! 

•Mean Streak— My 

least favorite, so mudi 

the jerkiest ride, -M, 
killing not only your "h^

The Communicator 



Cyber'tnag debuts on web 




Associate Editor Nigel Graham hard at work on the latest issue. 



PROM STAFF REPORTS 

Ccnozok Prcv, has unleashed a 
new humor magazine on an unsus- 
pccung audience of aboul 25 mil- 
lion web surfers around the world 
It's called Tlie Pulsing Puslule. and

The bi-monthly Pulsing 
Pustule, subtitled "A Money-suck- 
ing Mag of curious Drollery", is 
pubUshcd on the World Wide Web, 
the fastest-growing part of Ihe 
Inlcrnei. It features original, 
Pylhonesquc pieces such as "High 
Plains Auditor" and "What If Your 
Head Were As Big As The 
Universe^" 

"We Tigured it was time there 
was someUiing under the keyword 
'humor' that was actually funny — 
something oihcr than lists of hun- 
dred-year-old jokes or two-para- 
graph wannabes that never get 
updated," said Pulsing Pustule's 
technical editor Steve Lambeth. 



"We hired an independent test- 
ing lab. and they proved scienlifi- 
cally that Ihe Pustule is funny 
Really, ' adds an director Suzanne 
Cobb. 

According to the Georgia 
Insiiiuie of Technology, the average 
web user is 33 years old. cams 
SS9,000 a year, and is registered to 
vote. Ihe prc^rtion of women is 32 
percent and rising Asked how Uiese 
demographics tie in with the 
Pustule's marketing efforts, 
Lambeth said, "Wc want everyone 
on the Web to read us. but we're 
really focused towanJ a younger, 
more sophisticated, college edu- 
cated, co-ed audience: peopli 
comfortable with new idea.'* 
and new publishing

The magazine was 
founded by two out-of- 
work, self-styled "pre 
millionaires." They empha- 
size the internet's superiority over 
other media in tfrms of interactive-

Father's Day loses charm 



Dishing up leftouers: Daifi 




near poverty 
college stu- 
dent I always 
plan for 
upcoming hol- 
idays so I can 
allot for the 
gifts that will 
be purchased. 
Recently. 1 
looked at my 
hsi of debts and realized I was still 
paying for the Modier's Day gill 1 
had ordered for my mom I started 
thinking thai Father's Day was the 
next big money spending holiday in 
which I would go deeper into debt. 
Bui 1 quickly remembered thai 
my father and I haven't had a rela- 
tionship for the last six years. Well. 
1 thought at least I'll save some 
money that holiday Sunday. 

What though have I missed over 
the last six years that would be 
worth more Ihan the pnce of a 
measly tie or botdc of cologne 

When you think of it this way 
you wonder what went wrong I was 
the typical daddy's girl. I used lo sit 
on dad's lap and steer the wheel 
while he pushed on ibe pedals. 
When dad used lo work out in the 



garage, I would praciice my tap 
dance routine on the cement flotir, 
and he would critique my routine. 
On Saturday mornings he would 
take me out to the woods in our 
camouflage, and teach me to shoot 
riffles, and hunt for bi|uirreis. 

Now I have gone though four 
year^ of high school withoulmydad 
ever seeing a moment of it. not even 
graduation. He missed me gelling 
my first job. buying my first car, 
and going to the prom. When I went 
away to college I watched as all the 
tearful moms hugged Iheir kids, and 
Ihe dads re-hacked those old frater- 
nity memories of when they attend- 
ed dial college Yes 1 had the mom 
there, although not (earful because 
she was so glad not lo have lo look 
at my messy room again. But 1 Just 
felt somewhat different without a 
dad diere. 

I never thought Ihai this would 
happen, and let me tell you. the 
longer you don't speak to one of 
your parents, the less likely you are 
to reunite with ihem. You first 
believe ibai your parent should 
apologize, and ihey probably 
believe you should, but this only 
lengthens Ibe time when the two of 
you don't speak. 



Ld.st summer I tried to fmd 
some amends wiih him and make 
peace. 1 took the iniuative to travel 
to another siaie to see him and his 
family. Bui ihc damage was done 
Most of our time was spent with 
small talk, and picture reminiscing 
It just wasn't the same. We were 
Ntrangers. Living completely differ- 
ent hves now, I was no longer \he 
child he once raised, bui a young 
woman who had begun her own life. 

1 see how it has affected my life 
now 1 have a hard lime believing 
men, wondering if they won't leave 
at any time. 1 wonder if any other 
man can love me if I'm nol sure my 
own father does. I miss the male 
role model, the love and affection 
from a man who loves you uncondi- 
tionally and thinks you are the most 
beautiful thing in the whole world 

As I plan a wedding some day, 1 
will have lo find someone else to 
walk me down the aisle. My kids 
will lose a sense of dieir mother's 
history and miss having a 
Iher to play football with. 

WImtever your pet peeves are 
with your parents, remember diey 
are your ordy parents, and that's all 
you get. 



Xhasins Amy' shovs 
director still has right stuff 



BY NOL BeCKLEY 

Manaqinq Editor 

I doubt "Chasing Amy" is slill 
playuig in Fori Wayne, because it 
could be considered an an flick 
thai wouldn't appeal lo a mass 
audience. 

In a nutshell here is the story: 
boy meets girl at a comic book 
convention, they arc both canoon- 
isls. boy falls for girl, boy's fnend 
and comic book partner gets jeal- 
ous, girl is lesbian, girl falls for 
boy. boy becomes jealous asshole- 
breaks up wiih girl, boy tries lo 
gel back witli girl by asking her to 
do a bizarre mcnage-a-lrois wiih 
his comic book parUier, every- 
body goes iheir separate ways — 
The end. 

Isn't thai like every oiher love 
story you've ever seen? Tliis 
strange story walks a Ititn line 
between being intelligent and 
complete drivel. Luckily, 
writer/director Kevin Smith 
has enough skills lo keep 
this sioty witty, inlelligeiu 
and funny wiihoul resort- 
ing lo frathouse humor 

Smith even makes 
an appearance as his 
trademark character. 
Silent Bob- Silenl 
Bob, as in Smith's 
two previous films 
("Clerks" and "Mall 
Rats"), becomes the 
moral of the story. 
Even Silent Bob's 
partner, Jay (who 
also appears in each 
film), biiches to 
Silent Bob about dis- 
pensing the moral of 
the story. 

"Chasing Amy" 
opens wiih an incredi- 
bly hilarious argument 
between one of the mam 
characters and a fan of his 
comic book. Is he a tracer or an 
inker This sparks a fighl between 
"Banky" and a fan — his parmer,

Holden. 

Slill at Ihe comic book con- 
vention, we walch a "black niili- 
lant " canoonisl np apart the sci- 
ence ficlion/faniasy/comic book 
world for not having any black 
role models for children. In 
response lo this Banky invokes 
"The Holy Trinity" of science fic- 
lion/fantasy-Star Wars and Lando 
Calrissian. 

If this movie is slill playing, 
pay full price — if you find it at a 
SI theater, you found a bargain — 
lake advantage of it. If another 
intelligent film has left Fori 
Wayne, you may have to wail 
until it comes on video. 

While waiting you may want 

to cheek out one of Kevin Smith's 

other films, 

"Clerks" and 

"Mall 

' Rals," 



Ihe two. I would recommend 
"Clerks" because of ihe bizarre 
reality you're brought into, A must 
see for anyone young and in a job 
that you have to deal with people. 

"Mall Rals" is ihe worst of the 
three films. Rats is Smith's forget- 
table foray mto action comedy. 

Smith even apologized at this 
year's Sundance Film Festival 
(where "Chasing Amy" made its 
debut) for making Rats "Chasmg 
Amy" is Smith's Ihird in his New 
Jersey trilogy. 

If you have seen "Clerks" 
often, listen for some other refer- 
ences in Amy. Smith's first film, 
"Clerks" won Ihe director's award 
four years ago at Sundance. 
"Clerks" was made on a scant 
budget of S24.000 and grossed 
over S3 million.

Columbus Zoo in Ohio. According lo zoo direc- 
lor, Jim Anderson, the project has come with a 
ppce tag of approxiinatcly 556,000 which 
includes the consiuetion of ihe new exhibit and 
the Icasuig price of Ihe w^tbt»gb 

"li IS (ill pan 1)1 the /oo's cixiiiuumg cttort lo 
expose Ihe people of Fort Wayne to Ihe animals 
of the world." Andexyan said 

WdTthogs are iiauve to the grasslands and 
siivaiuiah of AJnta. They taii weigh beiwcen 
2U0 and 250 pounds and their htt span is usual 
ly 13 years. Distinguishing features of wanbogs

According to zoologist, Miebelie

the touiplKiion of the exhibit for Saturday's 
dcbul .ind Ihe warthogs' tnuisportaiion lo iL 

"We kive been trying lo persuade Yule lo 
enter his crate this past week, bul so far he won't 
put more than his head in iL Federspiel said. 
"Hopelully. with a UtUe sweet potato incentive, 
he will decide lo cooperate." 

The wartbugs will be located in a new 
exhibit jusl inside the cniiaace lo die African 
VeldL Because they will not be allowed to mate, 
Daisy and Yule will be in llie exhibit aliemalely. 
Visitors are likely lo see Uicm feeding on grain 
and veggies, resting, or wallowing in their spa- 
cious mud hole 

"So tar. there has been excitement among 
the visitors who have seen the new exhibit. " said 
Mark Weldon. zoo curator for Africa and 
Indonesia. "Warthogs have been making a 
comeback since the release of "The Lion King' a 
few years ago. When chddren see the word 
warthog, diey automatically scream 'Pumba!'"
