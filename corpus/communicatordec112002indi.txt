fasted and chosen paths of selt- 
iTn rtincilion. I have spent many 
hours examining myself, and I 
have found thai the middle road 
ol Buddhist philosophy works 
best for me. Buddhism focuses 
u pon self-examination. 

I have come lo a place 
where I believe that the spirit of 
Christ, or Buddha, is something 
lhal is practiced in everything I 
say or do. I cannot imagine treat- 
ing myself or others in ways that 
are abusive I cannot imagine 

fraying lo some undefined god

assume that I knew what was 
best for others. 1 cannot even 
imagine trvioglo name or define 
lhal mysterious life force that 
many call God. I try my best to 
live with what comes, to care 
deeply for myself and reflect 
llul caring in my words and 
actions. I often fall short, but I 
see that as an opportunity for 
growth. 

With all this self-examina- 
tion, 1 just cannol imagine why I

Writing about holiday tra- 
ditions is Ihe subject of Ihe week, 
so I have come up with a few 
things that should keep at teas! a 
few people on my bad side. 



take Ihe Christ (Jesus' 
Nazareth) out of Christmas. 

In past years, we heard and 
saw Merry Xmas, but that was 
pretty obvious So. happy holi- 
day seems to cover it all now. 
Jesus of Nazareth being bom in 
a manger is the reason 
Christmas exists. 

Webster's Dictionary defines 
Christmas (with cap.) as an 
"annual festival (25 December) 
in memory of the birth of 
Christ." To the student who told 
me Christmas is a pagan holiday 
— you are out lo lunch! 

However, Ihe date WAS 
chosen to COUNTER Ihe pagan 
lestivities connected with the 
winter solstice under Ihe emper- 
or Aurehan in 27A AD. [Feast ...I 
the Invincible Su) on Dec. 25, 
The actual date of Jesus' birlh 
has forever been in question. 
The name Christ and three addi- 
tional letters are what make the 
word Christmas. 

some folks in this country want 
to lake Christ oul of Chrislm.i. I 
don't see Muslims taking Allah 
mil ol Ramadan. Christmas is ,i 
Christian holiday given in mem- 
ory ol the birlh of Christ, same 
as Ramadan is a Muslim holiday 
given in honor of Allah. 

If you don't like Christ 
bcine in Christmas, then you 
should neilher observe nor cele- 
brate it. There seems lo be no 



one trying lo change Ramadan 
into a politically correct or more 
stylish sounding holiday where 
Ihey would take out Allah What 
would (hey call that? 
Ramadays? Please don't 
lake Christ out ol Christmas. He 
is Ihe reason for Ihis fanlasttc 
holiday lhal we have all learned 
lo celebrate and love. 

On a lighter note, I want lo 
share some of my own family 
Christmas traditions. Before 
Grandpa had a stroke, he would 
read Ihe first 2(1 verses Irom the 
book of Luke, Chapter 2 in the 
King James Bible. 

Then, it was a free for all. 
We cousins had piles of gills in 
from of us, and we just went lo 
town. Now lhat we are all 
grown, it is a bit more orderly, 
but not any more fun than those 
days when Grandma was still 

There's not much that can 



plenty. Dad used lo send u 



back down again a couple 
ot times, finding more messages 
each lime in different places 
telling us where lo go next. You 
knew you were getting warm 
when you had lo pul on shoes 
and a coat and run down to the 
milk stable. That was the pre- 
ferred location to leave a really 
special gift (or someone lo find. 

if Dad was feeling particu- 
larly ornery, you mtghl have to 
continue on up into Ihe hayloll 
or get in the truck and drive 
somewhere. I only remember 
lhal happening once. 

Another nice tradition that 
I have adopted is visiting a 
Christmas tree farm and cutting 
down my own Iree. There is a 
ureal tree farm called Slalc on SR 
14 in Sidney. Ind. You get in a 
wagon and sil on hay bales and 



thev lak 


vol 


hark 


to where the 




Yoi 




out and pick 










start to 


look 


the 


same after a 



while. 

If you're with a girl, you 
can count on Irekking back and 
forth all over Ihe hill multiple 
times before she finds the one 
that her heart desires Then, she 
will oiler lo help you cut II 
down, but she doesn't really 

put her hand on the hand-saw 
for about 10 seconds while you 
.ire cutting Ihe Iree, and she will 

be satis (led and feel like she real- 
ly got lo help. 

When you are finished, flag 
down the wagon driver. He will 
drive over and get you and help 
load your Iree in the wagon. 

Back at the bam, they pul 
your tree in a shaker lhat spins 
all the dead needles out, then 
Ihey measure, bag and load it for 
you Finally, you go inside and 
tell Ihe cashier how tall your tree 
was. pay lor it and Ihey give you 
free hot apple cider. 

It's a very memorable expe- 
rience. Some folks even lake 
their video cameras and film the 
whole process. 

At any rate, remember lhat 
Christ is Ihe reason lor Ihe sea- 
son, not Santa, reindeer trees or 
pretty lights Take some time lo 
re wiih your loved ones and try 
to be patient with cithers. You 
will never know if this 
Christmas might be Ihe last one 
spenl with someone you may 
take for granted. 

If you start to experience 

folks being rude and pushy, give 
them a smile, shake a hand and 
tell them "Merry Christmas." 
You will be surprised what hap- 
pens! It's contagious. Merry 
Christmas to all my readers. 
And to Ellen Moore, welcome lo

Women and their fascination with gossip 
magazines, will it ever be understood? 



By Gretchcn Hahn and Alan

Staff i. clumnists 

Mars Asks: Did you hear 
the one about Tom Cruise and 
Oprah's wild weekend together 
al a ski resort in Colorado' Or 
have you heard the truth about 
Ikn Affleck and Matt Damon's 
"friendship?" 

Well, neilher have I, but this 
sounds pretty much like something 
lhal you ladies would read in 
thuse celebrity piissip marines 
thai you tike so much. What is 
Ihis all aboul? One hundred 
pages of crap! 

My favorite section of one 
certain magazine is where things 
have been "overheard" from 
celebrities while doing such 
important things as having collee. 
tOkav. so I've skimmed them a 
lime or two.) (n Ihis section you 



may hnd a quote that goes some- 
thing like this: "You're out of 
cream." This is quality. 

What's next — a commentary 
of the woes of men having lo put 



the' 



i lei s. 



tup? 



That being said, everyone is 
entitled to read whatever thev 
want, and I'm fine with this type 
ot "gossip loumalism" existing 
in gossip magazines However, 
now this slut! is invading Sports 
Illustrated! 

The*, we cannot have. SI. 
now features a section dedicated 

bookings, divorces and other 
pci--on.il stufl that has nothing lo 
do with why 1 like to read about 

So, please, since poor little 
me won't be Ihe edilor of S.I. 
anytime soon, maybe vou could 
explain Ihe type oi thinking lhat 
is required to enjoy celebrity 



gossip! 

Venus Responds: Ah. yes — 
the famous gossip magazines so 
many of us subscribe lo in order 
lo keep up on Ihe latest slars' 
break-ups, who has the most 
expensive house and who's 
marrying Jennifer Lopez this 

For some people, it's those 
horribly pathetic tabloids — 
although I prefer the classier US 
magazine — to relay the latest 
juice on our favorite stars- I 
mean, who else could tell us the 
TRUE story of Justin and

Outrageous characters usher 
WWE into its newest era 



Fueled by Ihe public's 

unnplainable interest, professional 
wrestling has become a phenomenon 
unforeseen by any cnlic. Bui is the 
1-iewi.v-hif.i K*j;iii&gt; lo dulint- World 
Wreslling Entertainment (WWE) and 
its owner Vincent McMahon are 
venturing away (torn the type ol 
product that got the business its 
recognition. 

You have to give respect where 
it is deserved. McMahon tried, he 
really did. Bui after McMahon's 

Eltlwn WWF| bought World 
Championship Wrestling (WCW) 
from long time rival Ted Turner, lans 
haie been turning away. In the mid to 
late 1990s, the business was at its 
peak. The Monday night ratings wars

The touchy and sometime risque 

_ k, the real-lo-li(e wrestlers and 

the cult- like following for factions 

such as D-Ceneralion X and the New 

World Order defined Ihis new era. 

Upon purchasing WCW Irom 
Turner, McMahon smothered loads of 

feasibilities for the name and the 
rand. Instead of retaining WCW is a 
separate company, McMahon 
desecrated the name of WCW by 
turning it into a short running faction 
of its own. 

Alas, WCW, along with follow 
failing promotion ECW, went by Ihc 
wayside of factions last November. 
This raised the question of how 
McMahon would divide his talent 
and if he could keep afloat without 
the two writers who made WWF and 
WCW what they were With Vince 
Russo and Eric Bischofl out of the 
way, McMahon looked to Brian 
Gcrwitz and Paul Hey man to keep 
the spirit of the business alive. Too 
bad they failed. 

As 2002 draws to a close, 
McMahon seems desperate lo grab 
onto any attention he can muster. As 
more viewers are Dipping away from 
his TNN -based Miuw "Mm'idav Ni&gt;;ht 
Raw" to ABC's "Monday Night 
Football," McMahon Ls beginning r

wonderfully risque •vgments (does

McMahon overshadowed that 
horrifyingly terrible gimmick by 
bringing inily intense matches Kick 
into the folJ TLC 2002 (torn Las 
Vegas and Hell in a Cell between 
Brock Lcsnar and the Undertaker 
(Mark Callaway) took lhat fans oil 
the topic. 

Wuh the risk-taking storylines 
failing. McMahon has reprised the 
type of sports entertainment lhat 
failed in the early '90s. Now 
unbelievable characters, not over the 
top antics, run rampant again. 

Although McMahon slrays Irom 
entirely resuming Ihis theme, it's 
back and possibly to slay. The Raw 
brand boasts a good deal ol unreal 
gimmicks. The freakish Him crillr 
from Hollywood, known as Goldusl

To me, this is a change in Ihe

watching wrestling and even slightly 
into Ihe Altitude era. From clowns

McMahon Ls willing to throw away

away WWE's fulure. 

Gimmicks are one Ihing — Ihey
