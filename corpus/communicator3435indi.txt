However, for every child having fun during

by Child Protective Services (CPS) in have been 
Ihe result of child maltreatment, has steadily 
increased over the last decade The National 
Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCAN- 
DS) reported that in 1997 there were an estimat- 
ed 1.196 child fatalities, or 1.7 children per 
100,000 in the general population. (Tins estimate 
was based on reports: from 41 states thai reported 
s total of 967 fatalities.! The US Advisory 
Board on Child Abuse and Neglect in A Nation's 
Shame: Fatal Child Abuse and Neglect in (he 
United Stales." reported that a more realistic esti- 
mate of annual child deaths as a result uf ,ihuw 
and neglect, both known and unknown to CPS 
agencies, is about 2,000, or approximately live

Center for Prosecution of Child Abuse believe 
that the number of child Jejihs Imm maltreat.

As an individual, you have the power to prevent

According to NCANDS. if you find yourself in a situa-

abused at that moment, there arc steps you can take: 

Talk to the adult to get their attention away from 
the child. Be friendly Say something like, Children 
— really wear you out, can't they?" or "My child has

Ask if you can help in any way- 


-could you carry

can be fed or changed? Call somen

If you sec a child alone in a public place — for 
example, unattended in a grocery can — stay with the 
child until the parent returns. 

Hopefully we, ns a society, can slop these dreadful 
acts from occurring If anyone knows a child being

that, as she recalls, was not onl&gt; rc,i&gt;nn 
intolerant of the German POWs she I 
among, but of her family and herself, south- 
erners with a mixed European and Native 
American ancestry. "We were called 'trash' 
and 'din.' Wc were second class citizens," 
she says. Bui Stephenson only lumed this 
hatred inward upon itself, using it to "find 
Ihe good in things. I o be more understand- 
ing nnd to have more feelings for people." 
including strangers, ihe prisoners she saw 
every day.

taje Stephenson says that the camp wis 

*■» like its own linlc world on the edge of Fort 
Wayne. But it was an "ostracized" world, 
she says, a "nasty, dark secrel." 

She believes it was city residents' alli- 
ludes towards the prisoners and the people 
who lived and worked at the camp which 
caused many lo deny its ciisiencc, to disas- 
sociate themselves from the camp, and lo

i prisoned soldiers, Ihe U.S. was "pretty 
scrupulous" in following a 1919 Geneva 
Conference code dictating ihe rules for 
treatment of captured enemies. Germany 
honored the code and most American 
POWs came home 

However, in one such country Ihat did 
nol obey Ihese codes. Japan, there was a 
sigmTicanily higher death raie for American 
POWs. "Of the American POWs in 
Germany, only about four percent died. 
Over 35 percent of Americans captured by 
the Japanese died in prison camps," says 
Scolt The Germans themselves did not fol- 
low the codes in treatment of other coun- 
tries' prisoners. According lo Scolt, many 
Russian and other East European soldiers 
captured by the Germans were put into slav- 
ery, and were kept dial way, even-after the 



Many Americans resented the German 
POWs. Scott says that many people thought 
they were being "pampered." "They didn't 
like them al all." Slcphcnson remembers. 
Perhaps Americans had good reason. 
Although prisoners lived in considerably 
Spartan conditions and were subjected to 
general contempt by Americans, Scott says 
there were plenty of upsides lo Iheir stay at 
the camp. "Food was good," he adds. 
Prisoners got firsl rale ingredients, many of 
which could nm be ohlained by the com- 
mon person. 'This angered many people in 
Fori Wayne because ihcy argued lhal there 
were many decent, hard-working people 
here whocouldn'tcatas well as the German 
POWs.'' Scotl says. The Christmas dinner 
that the prisoners got caused an uproar. 

"They were served fresh milk and 
cream, which they saved to make butler 
Nobody could get bullcr during the war. lhal 
was just on unheard of luiury." Prisoners 
could also "buy two packs of cigarettes 



amenity that the prisoners received which 
also further angered residents was thai they 
"got lo see four first-run movies a week. 
Some wags called this the 'frill Rite' nnd 
complained that if the prisoners did gel out 
of line, they were just kept from Iheir beer 
and movie ration for a few days." The true 
punishmenl for when the prisoners did mis- 
behave was confining them to their bar-

Before being renovated to hold prisoners, 
Camp Scolt. located on Wayne Trace near 
Ihe Pennsylvania railroad, briefly served as 
a training facility for military personnel 
who were sent lo Europe to run the rail-

Not everything, though, has been lost 
By the fall of 1944, about the time that 
Stephenson's stepfather, a military camp 
guard, moved his family to Fon Wayne so 
he could keep vigil with about 60 other 
guards over Ihe prisoner, half a million 
German POWs had been captured by Ihe 
Allies. Many prisoners were shipped to the 
U.S. and Canada The U.S. sel up about 500 
prison camps to confine the men. Relatively

There was decent recreation too. The 
camp had radios, phonographs, ping pong 
tables, crafts, books and a small library. 
Prisoners set up their own school and taught 
English-which some already knew-music 
and an classes. They also had a len piece 
orchestra and a soccer league. Some prison- 
ers hid family members living in Ihe U.S. 
who would come visit them For news of 
the war, which Scotl says the prisoners 
always believed Germany would win, they 
had a subscription lo Ihe New York Times 
and listened to die BBC because they did 
not tritsl American radio stations. 

"Life was not that bad if you did what 
you were lold to do." Scolt says One such

also occurred at other camps. One 
researcher Scott talked to said diere 
were children generated at the camp in her 

The government did put the POWs to 
good use, though, not letting Ihem sit 
around and do nothing, 'The theory was 
lhat Ihese guys would go out and do work 
which needed lo be done and For which 
there wosn'l enough manpower during the 
war," Scotl says. "Most of Ihe regular pris- 
oners of war did go oul and work. TTiey 
worked on farms, faclories, in town in vari- 
ous capacities-lhey set pins at Ihe bowling 
alleys, were Ihe clean up crews for the Civic 
Theater, shoveled snow, raked leaves and 
did hauling." Although many prisoners 
were bused to their jobs, some prisoners 
were considered trustworthy enough lo go 
to work on iheir own. Some even drove Ihe 
city buses and garbage trucks. "The securi- 
ty wasn't as light as what one mighl have 
cipected," Scolt says. Some prisoners did 
try lo escape. Three hopped a Irain and gol 
as far as Van Wert. Ohio. Most prisoners, 
though, didn't try to escape. The prospect 

The prisoners were paid SI. 05 per day 
for Ihe work lhat they did Twenty-five 
cents went to support Ihe camp and 40 cents 
was in scrip which could be used at Ihe 
camp canteen to buy cigarettes, beer, candy 
and soda. The remaining 40 cents was kept 
in savings for the prisoners so lhal when 
they went back home, they had some cosh 
to lake wiih them. 

Slephenson recalls buying penny can- 
dies for Ihe prisoners al the canteen. "Some 
of them were very 



and guards were ollhc same age, aboul 19 
lo 21, they generally got along well, and 
some even forged friendships. But 
Stephenson remembers thai many guards 
drank heavily and would often beat ihe 
prisoners. 'There was a lot of sadness in 
it Many prisoners would cry Tor

iven so. Scon's research sug- 
:esls that they seemed lo run 
of things at Camp Scotl and 
many other prison camps. Scolt notes one 
piece of evidence which illustrates ihe Nazi 
dominance: "A fellow thai had jusl been 
sent up from one of Ihe Indianapolis camps 
supposedly comtnillcd suicide. But the evi- 
dence suggests very strongly thai he was 
murdered by other prisoners, was hanged 
and made il look like il was a suicide. There 
was never an investigation, bul ihis 
occurred at olher camps. It was clear thai 
Ihe more overt Nazis were rubbing oul peo- 
ple who were snilches or who were viewed 
as possible snitches." 

The Nazis were permitted lo "express 
their patriotism by pulling photographs of 
Hitler above Iheir hunks," Scott says. Many 
prisoners put up pictures of Rommel ' 
because ihey had been pan of his North 
African iroops, where the majorily of the 
prisoners came from Prisoners could also

salute was the "Heil Hitler." So you had

says. TTic officers didn't have lo work al all.

Camp Scott was one of Ihe firsl POW
