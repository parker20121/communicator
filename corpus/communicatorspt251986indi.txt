IPFW recruits volunteers 



By JOHN McGAULEY 
Slail Writer 

Mature adults with time to spare are 
invited to become part of a special 
program at IPFW. 

Designed to help out those campus 
departments which may be un- 
derstaffed or otherwise in need of 
assistance, the Affiuate Staff Program 
offers a chance for volunteers to apply 
past experiences, learn new skills, and 
meet new people in part time, unpaid 
jobs. 

According to Dr. Pauline Flynn, 
program coordinator, the original 
intention of the program was to use 
retired people to help out on campus in 
areas they were interested in. 
However, the program does accept 

Knox sells 
his club 

By LILLIAN R. LYON 
Managing Editor 

"Basically, we look at the field of 
marketing from a student's per- 
spective," said Bruce A. Knox, 
president of the Indiana University 
Marketing Club, about the club's 
function. 

The IU Marketing Club, formed at 
IPFW last Spring, gives students a 
chance to look at the world of business 
from a viewpoint outside the 
classroom Knox, a senior majoring in 
marketing, said the purpose of the club 
is to help students "expand their 
knowledge of marketing." 

To do this, he explained, the club 
meets regularly, usually on the second 
Tuesday of each month. Their first 
meeting, held Sept. 23, was aD in- 
troductory meeting for all students — 
not just business and economic majors 
— interested in the field of marketing. 
Members of the club, Knox noted, pay 
dues of 55 a year. 

Knox plans to have speakers at each 
meeting, mostly local businessmen who 
may discuss such topics as salary, 
career opportunities, and job 
descriptions — things a student cannot 
learn from a textbook. The speakers, 
Knox hopes, will "give club members 
some real business world knowledge." 

The club has four officers, who are 
appointed by election: Knox is 
president, and the others include Jim 
Belot, vice president; Denise Bauer- 
meisler, treasurer; and Threasa Early, 
secretary. The club's faculty adviser is 
Carlton A. Maile, a professor of 
business and economics at IPFW. 



anyone up to the age of seventy, an 
upper limit set by the Board of 
Trustees. 

In the past, the eighteen month old 
program has involved volunteers in 
such activity as dubbing tapes, word 
processing, preparing mailings, and 
preparing for such activities as the 
Regional Science and Foreign 
Language Fairs. 

These same activities, along with 
projects involving research, writing, 
labeling archaeological artifacts, and 
reading books onto tape for the blind 
are available this year. One area 
which is in particular need of help, 
according to Flynn, is the Athletic 
Department, which needs a 
statistician, an equipment manager, 



assistants in the concession stand, and 
a contact for visiting teams. Numerous 
other positions, canvassing almost 
every department, are available. 

The basis behind placement of 
volunteers, Flynn stressed, is getting 
each person assigned to an area doing 
"something where we will both be 
satisfied." She continued to say that 
"unless something is gained" by the 
volunteer and the campus, the program 
is not really successful. 

Depending on which department an 
individual is interested ia working 
hours can range anywhere from nearly 
full-time to only a few each week. Some 
projects are one-time only 
propositions, such as mailings and 
conferences. 



Although the jobs are unpaid, Flynn 
said that the program does have its 
benefits. The program "offers a chance 
to be in a nice environment with other 
people interested In helping the 
university," she stated. "Also," she 
continued, "there is an assurance of 
some kind of growth." Other benefits 
depend mainly on what the individual is 
interested in and what they are looking 
for in the program. 

Anyone interested in becoming a part 
of this program is invited to pick up 
information in the SPEA offices located 
in Nef( 260. Dr. Flynn will also be 
having an informative session and 
campus tour on September 26 and 
October 6 and 8, all at 10:00 a.m. 




Students engineer project 



Five IPFW students recently 
competed in the 1986 Midwest Mini- 
Baja competition at Michigan 
Technological University at 
Houghton, Mich. 

With 38 colleges participating, 
IPFW was one of the closer groups 
of students to travel to the com- 
petition. Other students traveled 



from as far away as Central Florida 
and Texas. Other participants were 
from the Midwest. 

Dan Fritzinger, Brian Schuman, 
Uoug LaLone, Tony Thompson, 
Brian Emrieh and Dan Valleskey 
were the representatives from 
IPFW in this year's contest. They 
are part of the Society of Automotive 



Engineers which is a student group 
involved in discussion and building 
and designing related to automotive 
engineering. Their first organization 
meeting is Sept. 30 at 2:30 p.m. For 
more information, students should 
contact Donald J. McAleece, 
professorof mechanical engineering 
technology. 



Series explores U.S. Constitution 



Garry Wills, syndicated columnist 
and professor of American culture and 
public policy at Northwestern 
University, was in Fort Wayne last 
week to discuss the adoption of the

radical side. 

Wills was the guest of IPFW's 
department of history, the Allen 



County-Fort Wayne Historical Society, 
the Allen County Public Library and the 
Louis A. Warren Lincoln Library. The 
program, subsidized by a grant from 
the Indiana Committee for the 
Humanities, is attracting speakers and 
scholars from the fields of law, political 
science, history and public policy.

Bell coordinates trip 

D.C. trip 
planned 



ByROBERTGRAY 
Staff Writer 

Always wanted to go to Washington, 
D.C, but never had the opportunity? 
Well, here is your chance. 

The division of early childhood 
education faculty at IPFW is spon- 
soring a trip to the Capitol from Nov. 13 
to Nov. 16. The cost of the trip is $150 
and includes roundtrip bus fare, Friday 
and Saturday double room ac- 
commodations, Continental breakfast 
on both days, and a bus tour of 
Georgetown and several monuments, 
too. 

While in Washington, D.C, students 
will attend the national Association for 
the Education of Young Children 
Conference on Friday, where such 
topics as the education of young 
children, developing relationships 
between teachers and students, 
discipline in the home and school stress 
management and curriculum and the 
effect on the community will be 
discussed. 

"The trip was open to only education 
majors first," says Dr. Gregory Bell, of 
the department of education at IPFW, 
"but in talking with people, I found that 
students from other fields such as 




stitution and the Northwest Oram. 
will continue for the next eight Thur- 
sdays at 7:30 p.m. and will be con- 
ducted at several sites in Fort Wayne. 

The series of discussions resulted 
from a year's labor between the 
sponsoring organizations and the work 
of James A. Haw. the chair of IPFW's 
department of history. Haw also served 
as project director. 

Other speakers appearing in the 
series are all from Fort Wayne. Haw 
will be the guest speaker tonight al 7:30 
p.m. at the Allen County-Fort Wayne 
Historical Society Museum. His 
scheduled topic of discussion is how our 
understanding of the forces and 
motives behind the writing of the 
Constitution changed over the years. 

On Oct. 2, Sylvia E. Neely, assistant 
professor of history at IPFW, will talk 
about Frendh liberals and the 
American Constitution at 7:30 that 
night in the Walb Memorial Union 
Building ballroom. The following week, 
Mark Neely, the director of the Louis A. 
Warren Lincoln Library and Museum, 
will discuss how Lincoln tried to 



reconcile the demands of victory in 
wartime with Constitutional guaran- 
tees of civil liberties. 

Louis A. Cantor will show how the 
Conslitution continues to effect change 
in our own day on Oct. 16 at 7:30 at the 
Allen County-Fort Wayne Historical 
Society Museum. Georgia Wralstad 
Ulmschneider, who lectures on political 
science at IPFW, will demonstrate how 
constitutional interpretation affects 
contemporary issues of civil liberties. 
His talk is scheduled for Oct. 23 at 7:30 
in the ballroom. The following Thurs- 
day another IPFW faculty member 
will discuss the Northwest Ordinance: 
Associate Professor of History, John P. 
Bell, will speak at 7:30 at the Allen 
County Public Library auditorium. 

On the last day of the series, Clifford 
Scott, associate professor of history at 
IPFW will look at 1787 from the per- 
spective of how the Indians fit into the 
Northwest Ordinance's plans for 
freedom in the territory. 

Each of the speeches will be bound in 
a commemorative volume published by 
the Indiana Historical Bureau.

sociology and psychology were in- 
terested as well." 

On Saturday, the group will be 
touring such monuments as the 
Washington Monument, the Capitol 
Building, the White House, the FBI 
building and the main building of the 
Smithsonian. 

The bus departs at 7 p.m. on Nov. 13 
and arrives around 8 a.m. the next day. 
Twelve out of 48 seats are taken, so to 
reserve your seat, a ISO non-refundable 
deposit Is due before Sept. 30. The 
balance ($100) is then due Oct. 20.

Meyer through the IPFW division of 
education. 



Stereotypes refuted 

West Lafayette, Ind. — A recent study at Purdue University shows that many of 
the best and brightest students choose teaching as a career. 

"Our research refutes the commonly held notion that education majors are 
academically inferior to non-education majors," says Gerald Krockover, Purdue 
professor of education and geoseiences who conducted the study with graduate 
student Holly Mortlock. 

They found that college students who major in teaching are at least as 
academically capable as those in the same disciplines who are not in education. 

"If there was a difference, it nearly always favored the education major," 
Krockover notes. "We're delighted to confirm the results of what we've suspected 
for a long time — that we're getting many of the best students in teaching. " 

The study compared 420 education majors to 168 non-education majors enrolled 
in the same schools of the university. The five schools in the sample included 
agriculture, consumer and family sciences, science, technology, and humanities, 
social science, and education. 

Students were compared on the basis of high-school rank, SAT total scores, and 
freshman and senior grade point averages. Also compared were the students' 
performance in three common core university courses — speech communication, 
English composition and psychology.

From Paris to Indiana, 
Catch the wave, IPFW 



Can you name one item of fashion that 
over the years has remained a steady 
big-selier? There are few, but one major 
article of fashion that has continued to 
show up in even the trendiest clothing 
stores is the sweatshirt. 

Sweatshirts can be seen anywhere and 
on anyone, it seems. From Gucci to K- 
Mart, from L'Universite de Paris to 
Indiana University, sweatshirts sell well 
and most manufacturers know this. 




In fact, the biggest seller of 
sweatshirts seems to be universities. 
Purdue, Indiana, Notre Dame, Michigan 
... they all have sweatshirts in their 
school colors with their name 
! emblazoned across the chests of 
countless students — even on some not 
attending universities. 

But one school is noticeably absent in 
the line of university sportswear, 
glassware, and paraphernalia. 

What school is it that doesn't promote 
Itself? That doesn't catch the wave even 



Coca-Cola has ... the wave of thousands 
of people who are willing to pay for the 
chance to give countless organizations 
free advertising? 

Go to Kettler Hall. Outside in the front 
of the school, there's a big sign that 
reads "Indiana-Purdue at Fori Wayne." 
Now go downstairs inside Kettler Hall lo 
Follelt's. There are sweatshirts from 
Indiana University and from Purdue. 
But Indiana-Purdue at Fort Wayne? 
There is a striking lack thereof! 

Why?! We'd like to know why there 
isn't a line of IPFW products to promote 
IPFW, especially when enrollment is 
down two percent. Maybe the 
administration needs to start thinking of 
merchandising IPFW, of 

commercializing the Mastodon mascot. 
Not only is it a way for the university to 
make a little money from sales, but it 
lets the rest of the world outside Fort 
Wayne land even some people in Fort 
Wayne) know that we exist beyond the 
realm of Indiana and Purdue. 

If IPFW is to become a stronger 
school, with increased enrollment, then 
the answer doesn't lie with just a line of 
IPFW products. But it is one way of 
getting the ball rolling, and it isn't a 
drastic step. 

Think about it. IPFW making money 
from advertising — not spending it. 



A little tight on cash? 
We've got the solution

How often do you use your IPFW 
student or staff identification card? 

Do you even know that these ID cards 
are available? 

If you are like most students, the 
answers to these questions are probably 
"Hardly ever," and "No." 

If you don't know what the ID cards 
can be used for, let us offer some ideas. 
Area businesses offer 10 to 50 percent 
discounts on their merchandise to people 
displaying their IPFW ID card 
Advertisers in The Communicator often 
have two-for-one offers or similar 
percentage discounts offered — but only 
when people display their ID card or 
bring the coupon from the paper. 

The Athletic Center admits students 
free — that is students who show their 
student ID. The Purdue-Indiana Theatre 
offers discounts into their productions — 
to people showing their IPFW card. 
Entrance into Student Government 
events— the movies, dances and parties 
they sponsor — require a person to show 
their IPFW ID card. The school trips, 
the Florida trip in the spring and the ski 
trip in the winter, offer discounts to 
people with an IPFW ID card. 

The card can be used for many other 
things on campus. You can use it to 
refund books at Follett's Bookstore You 
need some form of ID to reserve study 



rooms and check out materials at the 
library. You need to show ID to cash 
checks in the Bursar's Office and at the 
Sweete Shoppe. 

Do we have you convinced that the ID 
card is a valuable thing to have? Do you 
want to know where to get one? 

They are usually distributed at 
registration periods, but the folks in 
Student Services can help you with them 
any time. All you have to do is show 
them your paid fee statement from 
registration. 

Really, for students, the card is a good 
deal. You get discounts on food, clothing, 
jewelry and from businesses such as 
fitness centers. 

For faculty and staff members, the 
same applies. Although most of you 
survive on a somewhat larger budget 
than do students, we all are looking for 
ways to cut corners on our expenses. 

The answer lies in the use of your card 
and in using the offers given by 
advertisers in The Communicator. 
People on our staff and students' 
government representatives work hard 
to convince these businesses that IPFW 
members are actually alive and well. Do 
not disappoint them. 

Crawl out of your hole. Yank out your 
ID from your pocket or purse and save a 
dollar or two — today. 



Self-knowledge: the key to understanding 



Have you ever wondered 
why you act in a certain 
way? Or why, you, as well as 
all of us, sometimes are the 
perpelratensi of strange, 
hostile, and selfish acts; and 
at other times the sgent(s) of 
intelligent, calm, and in- 
trinsic volitions? The French 
essaiest, Montaigne, was 
well aware of the wide 
spectrum of human action 
when he commented, "I've 
never seen a greater mon- 
ster or miracle than 
myself." To understand why 
we are the culprits of such 
diverse deeds we must first 
be able to recognize, and 
identify, the causes of our 
own actions; we must first 
have self-knowledge. 

The theme of self- 



knowledge was the per- 
meating focus of the ancient 
Greek philosopher Plato's 
most important dialogue. 
The Republic. Plato believed 
it was essential Tor a person 
lo understand the causes ot 

Commentary 

his conduct, before he could 
modify and rectify his 
behavior. Without self- 
knowledge, a person is 
doomed to an existence of 
anger, fear, and anxiety; 
hence, never understanding 
the causes of his acts, and 
the direction in which they 
lead him. The concept of self- 
knowledge also has moral, 
political, and social im- 
plications; for how is U 
possible to have better laws, 



countries, and societies 
wjlhoul having better 
citizens? 

According to Plationic 
doctrine, the core and cause 
of human behavior flow from 
three main tributaries: our 
desires, our emotions, and 
our knowledge Our desires 
consist of things thai make 
us want, such as: appetites, 
impulses and instincts. They 
usually provide physical 
gratification, and are 
manifested in the actions of 
eating, drinking, and sex. 
Emotions are considered as 
spirits, ambitions, and 
courage 

They are fundamentally 
biological, and excite or 
oppress us, due to &lt; 



Emotions are the feelings 
we have in a certain 
situation, or about a certain 
object. Knowledge is the 
power to distinguish, classify 
and coordinate our sense of 
perception in terms of law 
and purpose. With 
knowledge we can relate, 
explicate, and generalize all 
internal and external 
phenomenon, including our 
behavior. 

The qualities of desires, 
emotions, and knowledge are 
in all men, but in different 
degrees, which explains the 
diversity of individual 
human beings and their 
actions. Plato believes our 
desires and emotions are the 
of our 









destructive behavio 



William Shakespeare's 
character, Macbeth, said, 
"to know my deed, 'there 
best not know myself..." 
(Act II, Scene II) If we are 
going to be the perpetraters 
of actions that will lead to the 
growth and maturation of 
our capacities and virtues, 
such as: courage, tem- 
perance, honor, and 
knowledge, then we must 
know ourselves and (he 
causes of our actions. 
Without self-knowledge our 
actions will lead us to the 
disintegration and disper- 
sion of our capacities and 
virtues, and like Macbeth, 
life will be a tragedy.

Just another day in Helmke Library... 



litic Uommunicatm 






Voices Across IPFW/ 



thought I would 
ever have reason to write a 
commentary, but there is an 
incident 1 feel that warrants 
being told. 

A few days ago, I decided 
to stop in the library to make 
some copies of an article. 
The material was on reserve 
there for a class I'm enrolled 
in this semester. I parked 
my car at a meter and 
deposited a nickle for 15 
minutes Since I only needed 
to make a few copies, I 
thought I had time to spare. 

Upon entering the library, 
1 immediately went to the 
reserve section at the front 
desk. There was no one 
available to wait on me so f 
stood there for a few 
minutes. When a young lady 
did appear, I asked her for 
the materials on reserve. 
She left and soon returned 
with a folder. I had to sign 
for it because I didn't have 
my library card with me. I 
was told that I could keep the 
folder for two hours, but that 



I couldn't take it out of the 
library. That didn't concern 
me because I only needed to 
make copies. 

I preceded to the first copy 
machine 1 saw. I lost the first 
dime learning to operate the 

Commentary 

machine. I made two more 
perfect copies, but soon 
discovered I had no more 
change. I remembered there 
was a change machine in the 
snack shop outside the 
library. When f looked 
through the window, ] 
noticed that the change 
machine was flashing. It was 
out of change. 

I went back lo the front 
desk, t explained to the 
young lady that 1 needed 
change for a dollar because 1 
was making copies and ran 
out of change. I also told her 
that the change machine in 
the snack shop had no 
change either. She told me 
that I needed to get change 



from the snack shop outside 
the library I explained 
again that the machine was 
out of money. She then in- 
formed me that I would have 
lo go to the nearest building 
to get change. 

Now, I couldn't take the 
materials with me. This 
meant that I would have to 
turn the folder back in, go 
find change, go back to the 
library, check the folder out 
again, and finally make 
copies. At that point, I 
decided to go home. 

As I was driving, 1 tried to 
assess who was to blame for 
my misfortune. Was I to 
blame for not having had the 
good sense to stop at the 
bank on my way to the 
library? I could have gotten 
change there. Or was it the 
vending company^ Should it 
have been their respon- 
sibility to make sure change 
was available in their 
machines? Or did the blame 
really belong to the 
university? Should they be 



aware of the need to have a 
change machine io the 
library to accommodate its 

I did find some humor in 
this situation. As I left the 
library's reserve desk, I 
noticed a sign which read: 
fines (1 an hour for overdue 



hourly 



My question 



is: If you went lo pay a fine 
which was a dollar and you 
only had a five, since the 
library doesn't give change, 
does this mean that you then 
get to keep the material for 
four more hours?

"Joining a sorority is a 
good way of making 
friends." 

These are the words of 
Christy Tippmann, a 
member of the local chapter 
of the Pi Beta Phi sorority. 
Apparently there are several 
women at IPFW who feel the 
same way. Many freshmen 
and sophomore women are - 
now trying to gain ad- 
mittance into these 
organizations by going 
through what's affectionally 
known as "Rush." 

"Rush" is the first step in 
becoming an active member 
of the Greek community. 
Everyone is encouraged to 
get involved. 

"I am so glad so many 
girls realize the importance 
of joining a student 
organization, such as a 



sorority," said Ann Shaw, 
president of Pi Beta Phi, 
"especially on a commuter 
campus like ours." 

Pi Beta Phi was the first 
female National Fraternity 
and has one-hundred and 
twenty chapters in the U.S. 
and Canada. There has been 
a Chapter at IPFW for 
twelve years. 

Delta Gamma is the 
second sorority on campus. 
Although a few years 
younger on a national level, 
Delta Gamma has been al 
IPFW exactly one year 
longer than Pi Beta Phi. 

Both sororities stress the 
importance of academics by 
having scholarship awards 
and study groups. 

"Rush" is just the 
beginning of the challenging 
and enjoyable things 
sorority life has to offer.

Freshman Laura Rhoades 

has led an inexperienced 

IPFW women's tennis team 

with a No. 1 singles record of 



Iresh out of New 
Haven Hit'*: School, defeated 
Judy Stewart of St. Joseph's 
6-2, 6-1 on Sunday, Sep- 
tember 21 for the second 
time this season. Slewarl 



won the GLVC conference 
No. 1 singles lille two years 
ago. 

"Laura will probably be 
seeded second at the con- 
ference tourney," said coach 
Dan Brogan. "She should do 
well, she's very intense on 
the court." 

Manju Usman, a 
sophomore seeded No. 2, 
dropped her match on 
Sunday 4-6, 4-6. Usman won 
the 1984 Great Lakes Valley 
Conference title at No. 4 



iingles. Altera year off from 
school and two from tennis, 
Usman has returned at No. 2 
singles. 

Usman teams with 
Rhoades to form a strong No. 
1 doubles team for IPFW. On 
Sunday, however, they 
dropped their match 3-6, 2-6 
as they ran into a formidable 
St. Joseph's duo. "Those two 
play really well together, 
they're always tough to 
beat," said Brogan after the 

Margaret Kidd and Janet 
Powe, the No. 3 and 4 seeds 
respectively, teamed up 
Sunday at No. 2 doubles and 
dropped their match 5-7, 1-6. 

Jackie Jeanty, No, 5 seed, 
and Kerri Nusbaum, No. 6, 
form the No. 3 doubles team. 
They also dropped their 
match against St. Joseph's. 

Coach Brogan stresses 
that it isn't loo late to come 
out and play if you are in- 
terested. "One girl is 
planning on playing in only 
our final match and the 
tourney," said Brogan. 

There are four matches 
remaining on the schedule, 
not including the conference 
tourney. Today they travel to 
Goshen followed by a Sep- 
tember 30th match at St. 
Francis and an October 2nd 
contest at Valparaiso. On 
October 7th they return 
home for their final match 
(Valparaiso) before heading 
to the University of In- 
dianapolis for the GLVC 
tournament on October 10th 
and nth. 



Coach Kast pleased with 
improvement of run tiers 



By GINA JONES 
Copy Editor 

"Improving is very im- 
portant and that's what my 
runners are doing. In my 
opinion, that Is what 
coaching is all about," said 
Mike Kast, coach of Ihe 
IPFW cross country team in 
a recent telephone interview. 

His statement pertains to 
the six runners he currently 
works with. On Saturday, 
Sept. 20, Mike Kast and his 
leam traveled to Taylor for 
yet another meet. Purdue 



took lop honors, with D?F\V 
placing 16. "The territory 
was very slick, and hard to 
get speed on. The ground 
was really soft; it rained for 
about an hour and a half 
before we got there." Mr. 
Kast continued on to say, 
"I'm proud of my runners. 
They are coming along very 
good; very respectable. By 
the end of the season we will 
really be showing how much 
work everyone has been 
putting forth."

Men's tennis drops opener 



By DARREN J. 
WAGGONER 

Sports Editor 
Anderson College edged 
IPFW 5-4 in the men's tennis 
fall season opener. 

The Mastodons played 
without No. 2 singles player 
Ken Kachmann, who had yet 
to join the team. Kachmann 
and Tony AmstuU, No. 1 
singles player, are the only 
returnees from last spring. 

"They fAmstutz and 
Kachmann) have improved 
tremendously since last year 
and playing this fall should 
help them tor the spring," 
said coach Dan Brogan, who 
also coaches the women's 
tennis team. 

"We really surprised 
Anderson by coming as close 
as we did. With Kachmann 
we would have won it," said 



Brogan. "We're improved. 
Our number two player has 
dropped to fifth and Tony 
killed Anderson's lop seed, 
he's playing real well." 

On Saturday the leam 
(raveled to Angola to take on 
Tri-State. Upon arrival, 
however, Ihey discovered 
the match had been can- 
celled by Tri-State's coach 
due to a threat of rain — an 
idle threat by the way.

rider, Vince Hoeser, broke a 
collarbone several days 
prior to the race and was 
unable to participate. Riders 
cannot be replaced within a 
certain period of time before 
the race, so The Cutters rode 
with only three cyclists. 
They became the first team 
in the history of the Little 500

members The Cutters broke 
another record in 1984 when

dependent team to win a 
Little 500 race. The three 
winning team members will 
be racing in the Little 500 
Challenge 

Qualifications are set to 
begin at 12:00 noon with the
