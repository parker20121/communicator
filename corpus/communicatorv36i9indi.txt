should be finished around 
June of 2007. However, Summer II will 
not use the building and is planned to 
open for fall 2007. 

"New Music," once completed, will 
fit with the academic landscape of IPFW 
structurally. Mr. Walt Branson spoke 
highly of the physical design. Firstly, 
New Music is a two-story building wiih 
offices and classrooms on the east side. 
This will fit the design of the pre-existing 
campus rather nicely. Branson then 
explained lh.it the west side will most

the moment.. nid no discussion lias 
raised in regards to student 
of art for the building. However, that 
is not outside the realm of possibility. 
Branson explained that student art 
submissions are difficult as "security" 
becomes an issue. Once submitted, no 
one wants the art stolen. 

The ambitious goals of the building 
are more than just to give IPFW a 
flashy new building and to expand (he 
campus. Obviously, "New Music" will 
give the II'FW musical program a home, 
instead of living in the basement of the 
Classroom Medical Building. The music- 
program will receive a huge boost, as 
Branson explained, because new. bigger 
and more rehearsal and practice spates 
will lie provided to the students. 

The new building is going to be 
modern and top-of-the-line. The 
basement of Classroom Medical will be 
inherited from the music department 
by another cramped department, which 
one, however, remains to be determined. 
Several of (he rapidly growing II'FW 
programs are being considered for the 
basement of CM. 

The University Master Plan expects 
to expand the academic sectors to 
the north and east of the Gates sports 
Center. "New Music" will be visible from

Bangladesh Night: 'Showcase Bangladesh' 



By Sam Win 

s w i n Ol p fwtomin u n i tato r. o rg 

The Bangladesh Student Association 
(BSA) is one of the most active student 
organizations at IPFW. Since its induction 
in 2001 by former President Mahmudur 
Dhuiya, this student organization has been 
involved in several activities For die good 
and welfare of the IPFW community. 

Last year, BSA received The 2004 
Student Organization of the Year,' 'Student 
Leader of the Year' and Advisor of the Year' 
award by the IPFW Student Government 
Association. 

To keep being an award- winning 
association. BSA plans to celebrate die 
"Showcase Bangladesh" October 29, 5:30- 
8;30 p.m. in the Walb Student Union 
Ballroom. 

"This year, we want to provide a day- 
long showcase of Bangladesh to the IPFW 
community," Treasurer of BSA Jasmin 
Rahman said. "In this showcase, one will 
find almost everything: basic facts, vital 
statistics, information about culture and 
lifestyle, images, sounds, food

said. "Our executive committee is advisor 
Dr. Ahmed Mustafa, vice-president Romel 
Khondoker, treasurer Jasmin Rahman and 
general secretary syed Annan."

The Bangladesh Student Association

performed a cultural show, showed a short 
film, and served authentic Bengali cuisine

Bengali culture, history, and heritage

here at IPFW. 

"For the current event we are making

lasmin explained why Bangladesh 



Ahmed Mustafa and his wife Dr. Parveen 
Quarrar, and all the members of Bangladesh 
Students Association worked very hard for 
the Bangladesh Night," lasmin said. "We 
tried to reach every faculty member, staff 
and students here at IPFW to talk about our 
events. Also, we had a very good program 
and delicious and tasty food. That all made 
Bangladesh Night so successful." 

Bhuiya explained why he chose the 
"Dance with the Tiger" title for last year's 
event. "Royal Bengal Tigers come from 
the forests of Bangladesh (especially 
from Sundarbans, the largest rainforest 
in south Asia). Hence, we decided to call 
us (our members) tigers or Bengal Tigers 



Bangladeshis)." 

"Dance with the Tigers" meant "Dance 
wiili Bangladeshis." 

The first BSA night was in the spring of 
2003- sponsored by ISO. BSA performs/ 
joins about 80 events per year. 

There were more than 300 guests in Like 
Discover Bangladesh, and more than 400 in

Because the last two events we had i 
lot of guests and this year v. 



e expecting 
people will join our event, due to 
problems, we decided it 
will be open house so we will not face any 
problems." 

This year, the event will have display 
booths displaying culture and heritage, 
products, dresses, food etc. 

Everyone will be served with snacks 
and drinks. Dinner will be sold for S5 per

Staff Editorial 



The duty of an American soldier 



The 



i.ldlt'l ll.is 



among one of the most hated and 
feared occupations in the world. 
On the one hand, they are holders 
of the best training, equipment and 
mobilization among any armed 
forces in the world. 

ihese highly trained soldiers have 
been the most successful in open 
warfare over the last one hundred 
years. Without a question, the United 
States has the best army in the world. 

On the other hand, the very 
soldiers who are intended to keep 
the peace are often looked upon as 
unwanted peacekeepers in areas 
where they aren't welcome. Their loss 



is ofien subject to the protests and 
cries for removal from combat by 
their friends and loved ones. 

The wars that politicians debate 
and decide upon are fought by these 
brave men and women, with many 
coming home in caskets, and some 
not at all. 

There is only so much that can be 
said about these individuals, who 
risk their lives in a greater effort to 
preserve the ideas and beliefs they 
grew up learning. For many of them, 
it is about honor and loyalty. Some 
do it for an occupation. Still others 
serve without feeling of a better 
iilieniiKive in life. 



It would be a shame to neglect 
the thoughts these people ponder 
while out serving their country. Much 
responsibility is required to perfom 
such a task, and there is argued to be 
many things on the minds of these 
soldiers. 

The worst thing the average 
citizen could do is blame them for 
doing their duty. Many fight and die 
so others can live without conflict. 

War is evil, but mankind has failed 
to rid itself of such a plague, so it 
seems there will always be soldiers. 
These soldiers are human, although 
they perform that which others find 
inhumane.

The labeling of the "Greatest Generation'' proves quite 
eftec lively that the am ienl practice ol ancestor worship is 
alive and well in America. And what else could possibly 
influence the practice in America hut capitalism. 

Ancestor worship involves offering tribute to one's 
deceased ancestors, seeking to admire their deeds and 
validate their memories. Many practices are included 
in this worship Offerings are made at gravesites. items 
the deceased may use ill the afterlife m;i\ be placed dose 
by, and one practice is sometimes referred to as "Spirit 
Money" or "1 !el! Notes. " where money is burnt for use by 



the burning ol money Never fear, 1 apilahsts have lound 
a way around this most absurd worship practice. 

What happens? Tom Brokaw writes a book aboul the 



oldest generation, loin Hanks makes 11 

Washington D.C. commissio 

and rinky-dink companies make trivial collective tins 

which our generation will have to sort through and cart 

off to the Antiques Huadshow to find out ihey're worth a 

ininisaile SI. fit) upon our ancestor's passing. 

All of these apparent "tributes'' are nothing more than 
glorified ancestor worship. Ancestor worship that seeks 
(o avoid, above all else, the incompetent incineration of 

It is ancestor worship on steroids, with capitalism 
providing the enhancement. The elderly generation is 
considered so great because businesses realize they have 
a large portion of the money supply and it makes little 
sense for them to die with it. That would mean their 
children receive the money via inheritance and then the 
Man has to wait through another twenty years of tight- 
asset) spending to get his greedy, capitalist-loving hands 
on their cash. 

Capitalism has realized the absurdity of waiting until 
death to worship, our ancestors... we can't make any 
money bom it then! 

But that which, by far. detracts most from the oldest 
generation's greatness is their widely held opinion that the 
whole world is coining to an end (MINT: your existence is 
coming to an end.. .you ARE going to die). They satisfy 
the fear of their own concluding existence by finding our 
world impious arid a In sina I. claiming the end is near (it 
is.. .for all or us...l reiterate, we AW going to die, be it 
seven or seventy years). 

Where we see progress and innovation, the older 
generations see the devil. It can't possibly be better that 
we have access to inhumation bom every corner of the 
globe, allowing us to iinpaibi/i' with people different from 



ourselves rather than demonize them, 
slaughter and sacrifh e, hut the minute size of our entire 
military is dwarfed by the number of those who lost their 
lives in World War 11. That, I believe, is true greatness. 

I don't want to disparage everything about this elderly 
generation. I appreciate their existence, as it paved the 
way for my own. Yet, to deem one age group better than 
another results in nothing but a lackol the aforementioned 
empathy that would make every generation, and our 
relationships with each other, great.

very drastic separation between the rich 
and the poor. 

Being a college student, I have high 
hopes of one day making a lot of money 
and living in a big house. This dream, 
however, for some, is short lived. 

I was at the mall yesterday and 
walked into one of the big department 

I was looking around at the various 
Christmas decorations and then came 

across the furniture and home appliance 
section. Right away, the thought of what 
comfort and convenience is came to 

The issue to this was the price you 
were asked to pay for it, This very 
ihougbt hit rue hard. 

I mean, the wants I have and the 
desires to have nice things all play well 
with trying to get a college degree. 

Once you have one, landing the ideal 
job comes next. The question I have 
though is what about (hose people less 
fortunate than I? 

More high school students are 
moving onto college today than when 
my parents were in high school. This is 
due to obvious reasons of our society 
changing. 

The issue though is that there arc 
so many adults who are in the work 
force who have never had either an 
opportunity iu go In school or chose to. 

These individuals, when faced with 
layoffs, are put into a very unbearable 
situation. I was watching a program 
on television the other night and it was 
talking abtuit the issues of minimum 
wage and how our society is dealing or 
not dealing with it. 

It mentioned that in order to have 
the bare necessities met, an individual 
would need at least $10 an hour to 
survive. I pondered this for awhile. 

McDonalds and other fast food 
restaurants hire in em jiloyees at between 
$5 and $7 an hour, depending on where 
they are located in Port Wayne. With 
this thought, that is three to five dollars 
less (ban needed, according lo some, to 



dor 

The program also mentioned 
certain ideas in raise the city or county 
minimum wages, but this would only 
apply for government or state positions. 
There were of course problems with 
this that showed it to be an unfeasible 
solution. 

Willi so many layoffs and companies 
moving, whal does the future hold for us 
college students? I read in (be paper last 
year after graduation thai there were 
still all percent of the students looking 
lor jobs a year alter graduating 

To me, this does not sound like ihe 
future I held in my mind as I started my 
college career. 

I be doubts aboul our economy and 
what it holds for not only those of my 
generation, but the younger youth and 
those who will be. it I ending 1 ollegeallei 
I have hopefully well adjusted myself 
Into a great career worry me. 

The future may not look so bright 
in some respects, but I guess in others 
there is always a bright side. 

I mean, I am very thankful for my 
opportunity to attend college and the 
chances it has brought me and promises 

I do hope sunnier days are ahead 
for us college students as 1 know myself 
coming close lo graduation see worries 
starting. 

Four years, five years, and maybe 
even six years of college seems a lot to 
go through if you are thrown out into 
the world and have a slim chance of 
landing on yoin own IwofeCt. 

I hope that within the next year the 
economy changes to allow new jobs 
arid careers to be started for those of us 
abtuit ready to graduate and that we will 
be able 10 live those lives we dreamed 
aboni entering our Mrs! days ol college 

May all of you be thankful for your 
opportunities to be here and make the 
best of your future opportunities. 



Sometimes words 
are not enough 



Trade Mark 



Why is it dial many of us believe, and 
go as far as to act, upon an idea that 
a few kind words are enough to patch 
up all wounds and renew the things we 
can't take back? 

You hit someone, and say you're 
sorry right afterwards. There is a dispute 
among lovers, and the one at fault says, 
"I love you" to try and make tilings better. 
We use words to replace actions all the 
time. It's just not enough to insert a few 
kind words when prevailing knowledge 
holds paramount actions over words. 

If you break it down to the simplest 
elements, words are just a means of 

relaying the thoughts and ideas from 
person to another. 



creatures such as us Homo sapiens. I'm 
definitely not saying there would ever 
per se be a situation where these words 
wouldn't be in the arsenal of things 
to say. I am arguing that we, without 
even realizing it, justify some of the 



I'erbaps, actions could be used in the 
same manner, but to my experience, 
they often prove to be much more 
effective. Do you say sorry to someone 
you knocked on the ground, or run and 
get them a bag of ice? Sure, doing both 
would be the best thing to do, but how 
many of us do it, right away? 

It's funny the power words can 
have over people. 1 previously noted in 
another column that the pen is mightier 
than the sword. Still, the sword itself is 
what you feel, and I'm sure enough that 
it hurls to step in front of a swing. There 
are a few words that if taken out of our 
vocabulary, would make life a lot harder 
than it already is to deal with. 

What would you say to your significant 
other if "1 love you" wasn't an option? 
How do you cope with someone you 
have wronged if you couldn't just say. 
"I'm sorry ", and needed to find another 
way to show them you care? 

Let's take it a little bit further, and 
say that you couldn't even tell someone 
that you care. That hard part is coming 
to grips with the fact that we often use 



better maimer than a typical person. 
who could do the obvious to handle the 
condition. 

The next time you do something 10 
merit an apology, or some automated 
response, do something besides use 
your mouth if at all possible. There has 
been much said supporting the use of 
body language. Try communicating 
your thoughts with actions. To put a 
disclaimer out there to silence that 
smartasses of the world, I don't mean 
use sign language either. 

Here's an example, there is a person 
that you ran into at the supermarket. The 
collision subsequently knocks the items

stop. Help them pick up their items. If 
you see something is damaged, help 
them get another one. Make sure they 
are all right, duh. Perhaps they could use 
a hand getting things to the check out 
line, you never know. You never know 
when times like these help you find a 
new friend, loved one or life partner. If 
nothing else, you did something good 
for someone other than "Me, Myself

Film Review 




You have all seen the pre\ iews. You all know 
this is not Shakespeare or Spielberg. The Rock is 
cooking, hveryoiie knows what to expect when 
they buy a ticket for "Doom." However, they are 
dead wrong. 

Doom is an action flick on par with the 
1980 AHNOLD{!) films that made action flicks 
great. Dwayne Johnson [The Rock) is the "New 
Arnold" and has been carrying himself well in 
every movie he has made.

this is an action movie, mid they are very good,

The movie uses makeup, costuming and

which is a nu e change ol pace from i tie t oiistant

Lightning and the color blue play a big role 
in the film, and are done in such ,i w.u to build 
tension just by having potential dark corners to 
jump out of. The sound works on every level. 
Musically, someone opting to use guitars and 
heavy rills injures the tension almost as bad as 
the jokes do.

Democrats hopeful for 2006 

■ Upcoming elections could prove to be the comeback that the Democratic party has been waiting for 



By Jordan Majewski 



(U-WIRE) IOWA CITY, 
Iowa - Midterm elections are 
more than a year away, but 
Democratic congressional 
candidates nationwide 
including Mount Vernon, Iowa, 
native David Loebsack, who 
is running for the U.S. House 
in Iowa's 2nd District — are 
already beginning to him at 
the possibility of taking back 
: of the legislative 



response to Hurricane Katrina, 
the ongoing war in Iraq, 
soaring gas prices, and the 
recent indictment of House 
Majority Leader Tom DeLay all 
converging on voters' radars, 
some say Democrats have a 
renewed chance to capitalize 
on an anti-incumbent vote in 
2006. 

"If trends continue against 
President Bush, it will certainly 
rub off on bis delegation," said 
Ul political-science professor 
Michael Lewis-Beck, noting 
the president's recently dismal 
approval ratings. "I wouldn't 
want to speculate if the 



is waning. The latest Gallup Poll 
shows the public's approval of 
the way Bush is handling h is job 
is at 39 percent, public approval 
of Congress at 29 percent, and 
overall satisfaction with the way 
things are going at 31 percent. 

Democrats would need to 
pick up 15 seats to regain a 
majority; five seats are needed 
in the Senate. 

And, while Iowa 2nd 

incumbent Rep. lames Leach 
is a Republican by name, he 
has generally tried to distance 
himself from the present 
administration. 

Still, some say it will be hard 
for him to escape his party's 
recent missteps unscathed. 

"He still regularly votes along 
party lines, so it's hard for him 
to get out from underneath that 
label," Lewis-Beck said. "But, 
because he distances himself 
more than most Republicans, I 
think he will be tarred less with 
that brush." 

In a prepared statement 
for "The Daily lowan', Leach, 
currently in Washington, 
D.C., responded somewhat 
apathetically to his party's 
recent faux pas by saying 
simply, "I have never known a 
time when people wanted more 
independent thinking and 
independent judgment." 

Gary Grant, Leach's 
district director, said it would

"Iowa played a great game," coach 
Amy Robertson said. " They contained 
us defensively and negated our speed." 



Ill's first and only score of the game 
came in the fifth minute of the first hall 

when senior midfielder Kayla Kasliore 
scored her team-leading 11th goal of 
the season. The Hoosiers took the 1-0 
advantage into halftime. 

Iowa quickly tied the score at I - 1 in the 
second half, when Kara Zappone netted 
a goal for the Hawkeyes five minutes 
into the period. After 30 minutes of 
scoreless play, the score remained tied 
at 1-1, and IU entered its third overtime 
game uf the year. 

After eight minutes of overtime play, 
Iowa's Caitlin McCurdy scored her third

Hawkeyes upset the Hoosiers 2-1. 

"I think they just wanted it a little

Morgan Albini said. "It was (heir Senior

"We were gushing fuel,

MacMillan said. "Reporting is

Only5-foot-4 throughout her 
college career, but constantly 
growing in her soccer skills 
Nicole Hall's ability to adapt and 
improve has pushed her into a 
pivotal role for the Mastodons 
this season 

She may be small, but don't 
let her size fool you. Nicole 
Halls, junior midfielder for the 
Mastodons, is as scrappy as they 
come. Known for her ability to 
pass the ball and make smart 
decisions on the field for IPFW, 
Hall's transitions from youth 
soccer to the high school and 
collegiate level have been filled

elsewhere for summer travel

South Bend to play. "Bobby

and eager to play, her parents 
signed her up in Hammond,

"My first team was mainly

Halls was forced to drop 
basketball and focus primarily 
on honing her soccer skills. 

"I played basketball, but 
soccer was my passion," Halls 
said. "In high school, I decided 
to dedicate myself primarily to 
liL-nuriiifi my game." 

This dedication paid off 
as Halls began to search for a 
college to continue her career. 
Her small stature, at only 5- 
foot-4, was a bit of a stumbling 
block, but her skills and overall 
knowledge of the game, kept 
Mastodons soccer coach Terry 
Stefankk'wicz interested. 

"She was overlooked by 
many of the state ranking

IPFW for many reasons.

Confidence isn't the only 
attribute of Halls that has been 
perfected since her signing 
with IPFW three years ago;

"In the 
plays for the Professional 
Development League," 

Stefankiewicz said. "It has really 
helped her hone her skills." 

Though only a junior, Halls' 
improvement both technically 
and mentally gives rise to higher 
expectations from her coaches.

it comes to her style of play. 

"I am not playing the way I 
would like this year," Halls said. 
"I am not attacking the ball well 
enough. My play has fallen a bit 
from last year. I am not doing 
what I need to be doing." 

While Stefankiewicz always 
seesroom for improvement with 
all his players, he recognizes 
the strides that Halls has made 
in perfecting her game, and 
expects more from her in her 

"Nicole has the ability to 
control the tempo of the game,"

More things to work on, but 
thai is okay with Hall. It is 
all part of a process she's been 
working on since she was five, 
her evolution in the game.
