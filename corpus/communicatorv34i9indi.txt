The haunting truth of the IPFW campus

you 
gonna call? 

The Ghostbusters? No. Their 
methods are too extreme for today': 
world. They'd just go in like an occu 
pation force in Iraq and blow every- 
thing up, maybe accidentally 
unleashing all of the evil in the fu&gt; 
tory of the world. 

How about a priest? No. Priests 
will handle possessions and bless- 
ings, but no ghosts. Plus, you don't 
want to get the bright green vomit 
everywhere, and head-spinning is 
bad for your neck. 

No, today's ghost problem calls 
for a milder, gentler, more scientific 
approach. The Indiana Ghost 
Trackers are the ones to call. They 
are a not-for-profit organization 
dedicated to investigating, tracking, 
and recording paranormal activity. 

Laugh you may, but they are a 
busy bunch. Recently, the 
Communicator and the Department 
of Theatre invited the Ghost 
Trackers to IPFW. Not only is the 
Studio Theatre allegedly haunted, 
but the State Developmental Center 

burial grounds used to be on campus An IPFW student channels spirits whil 
near Williams Theatre and the 
Visual Arts building (until the 
graves were moved in 1961 to their 
current location at the corner of 
IPFW next to Canterbury Green.). It 
was decided these located needed 
investigating, to see if they truly are 
haunted.

Column: b v Debor 



The Bloodshed of Baghdad 

In America, it seems, every generation gets a Vietnam. 

Ours is in the cradle of civilization. A cradle now rocking with bomb blasts and coated 
in a thick layer of bloodshed and quaqmire. 

It's not that liberating Iraq xvasn't a good idea. It should have been done 12 years ago 
when we teased Iraqis with promises of backing them up if they revolted against Hussein. We 
backed them up with verbal damnation against the regime. While we babbled to the United 
Nations, Hussein's regime put them down with bullets. 

And we wonder why some Iraqis have a hard time trusting its. 

America went into Iraq on thin evidence and with few allies inside or out. In World War 
II, there ivas a huge population of French Resistance looking to take back their country after 
we landed at Normandy, in Vietnam, we had fighters. Even as recently as Afghanistan, we 
were able to overthrow the ruling government with the people who were victims of the gov- 
ernment. 

in Iraq, we had propaganda and a bad reputation. That doesn 't do much for public rela- 
tions. While many Iraqis now trust us and zvelcome our involvement, we are going to have to 
endure many more body bags of dead Americans because some Iraqis look at the Hussein 
regime as either their leaders or an internal problem. We didn 't help after the first Gulf War, 
why assist now? 

This is our very own Vietnam. We tucked tail after Somalia in 1993. We won't do that 
here -- but nobody in our government has offered a clue as to wlmt our out strategy is going 
to be. 

Our current strategxj seems drunk, confused or annoyed. We need to have leaders who 
are sober, thinking and calm. 

Editorial 

The end of election season 

The nice thing about election season is, it ends. 

After several months of babbling commercials from Linda Buskirk, and potty-break excuses 
from Mayor Graham Richard, the city will soon be put out of its collective misery after one of the two 
are elected mayor. 

Not surprisingly, the campaign has been another series of missed steps from both local parties. 
Richard has tried to take the high road and attempted to point out his accomplishments as mayor, but 
anytime he seems to tout an accomplishment, another company decide* it is going to lay off another 40 
people. 

Buskirk has been so focused on her 50 ways to better Fort Wayne and 101 ways to accomplish 
more better things and 203 ways of adding jobs that she lost focus on one issue: why anyone should 
vote for her. Vision is nice, but her vision has been sidetracked by GOP leaders at the local and state 
level trying to pick a fight with Richard. 

Richard, citing health troubles, lias used some type of "l've-got-alligators-in-my-tummy" 
excuse for most of his scheduled debates and candidate forums with Buskirk. Even if his health is a 
legitimate issue, there have been a few times he's been caught skipping a candidate debate and making 
his way to a fundraiser. 

Practicing democracy is a healthy exercise in the people's choice - especially on a local level - 
and thankfully neither candidate has thrown a lot of mud. But neither has given a reason to support 
their efforts as well. Both have proven at times to be pawns to their parties and lacking in leadership. 
Luckily, mayoral elections only take place every four years. There's probably a reason for that. 



It is a wonderful life 



Someone said to me today, "I'm worth more dead than 
alive." While most people would just consider that remark 
dramatic license or air filler, it has its relevance in today's 
world. 

I'm sure some of you may have been reminded of the 
movie, "It's A Wonderful Life," with that remark (and before 
Halloween, too). This movie has been a "Christmas chest- 
nut "for more years than we have been alive, individually and 
probably collectively. In this movie, James Stewart plays 
George Bailey a man who in a night of desperation tries to kill 
himself because he's worth more dead than alive due to a life 
insurance policy he carried on himself. 

An angel of sorts; named Clarence, comes to rescue 
George and show him that it really is a "wonderful life. " But 
first they must relive George's life as if he were never born in 
order to validate the "worth" of his life. 

Speaking from experience, large credit card debts, excalat- 
ing utility bills, increased costs of school and living may seem 
overwhelming, but we all carry some sort of "financial liabil- 
ity. " We may even have enough insurance to pay off our 
homes, cars and debts, if xoe die. Perhaps we would even 
cover all our Earthly debts and be debt free on the "other 1 side. " 

Of course, that remark seems ridiculous, because there are 
no "monetary debts" in heaven or the "other place. " 

While it may seem that life is "money based," it is really 
"heart based." Wlmt price can you place on holding your 
own baby, or zoinning a basketball tournament, or talking to 
your grandparents about the "good old days?" 

Remember your first dog, your first date, your senior 
prom, your first car, your first apartment? What you remem- 
ber are feelings associated with those events. You remember 
the humorous moments, the pride of your accomplishments, 
you remember your "core self" before money became "king. " 

George Bailey saved his brother fvm falling through the 
ice and dying, he kept his mother from being alone, he saved 
a librarian from being ah old maid and even helped Clarence 
get his wings. While each of us may not have touched so 
many people in such overwhelming ways, we all have made a 
difference to someone. 

Look around you, whom have you helped by just being 
there? By listening to them in their time of trouble or offer- 
ing them a place to stay? Whom have you helped with their 
homeivork or said an encouraging word to? Whom have you 
told that you are proud of them or that you love them? Those 
moments were not money based, they were heart based. 

So you want to be a millionaire? You want to win 
Powerball so that all of your problems and debts will be fixed? 

Think again. You are a "mint" with the ability to do 
many positive actions in your life. For you see, you really 
Imve a wonderful life.

in the top five said they enjoyed 
the week. 

"I really enjoyed myself," 
sophomore Tyela D. Wilson said. 

The 19-year-old Fort Wayne 
resident spoke of the week - and 
the night — which incorporated 
Miss IPFW. 

"It was fun, but it was a lot of 
work," Wilson said. "It was stre- 
neous," she added. 

Wilson said she intends to try 
out for Miss IPFW next year now 
that the pageant bug has bit her. 

Other IPFW students 
involved included Marquita N. 
Bennett, Amber L. Bolinger, Breona 
Conrad, Jacqulyn S. Eakright, 
Angela Koble, Rachel M. Nix, and 
Ashley Portz. 

Baczynski is becoming slight- 
ly used to the spotlight - and real- 
ity TV is becoming an ongoing 
theme in her life. Over the summer, 
she was on a reality television 
show for Fox Family based on the 
concept of Dance Fever. The show 
was filmed in Las Vegas. 

Even though she didn't win, 
she enjoyed the chance to be 
judged by MC Hammer, Carmen 
Electra and dance choreographer 
Jamie King. 

"That was an awesome experi- 
ence," she said. 

But Electra didn't like her out- 
fit. 



ing. 

While she initially performed 
her routine to "Mama, Screw Your 
Wig On Tight," producers asked 
her to make it "mote contempo- 
rary" and included some jazz 
dance. Baczynski admits she 
regrets doing that now, wondering 
what the trio of judges would have 
thought of her tap.' 

However, she was thrilled 
with how far she went in the 
process. 

"It was my first real audition 
ever, so to get that far was cool," 

Her reign for the next year 
will see her as a representative of 
IPFW - and will culminate in the 
Miss Indiana pageant. 

"I'm going to go down there 
and try my best," she said. 

She'll be joined by at least one 
other IPFW student. IPFW junior 
Tonya Cooper was selected from a 
contest of 17 to be crowned Miss 
Huntington. 

Four Miss Indiana's were in 
attendance — along with over 300 
audience members for the night at 
Walb Ballroom. Among the former 
Miss Indiana's were Carol Mitchell 
Bennett (1951), Anita Hursh Cast 
(1958), Jane Flanagan Hersha 
(1962) and Sara Engerman Church 
(1997). All four are Fort Wayne res- 

Baczynski noted the selection 
is a sign of IPFW's continuing 
growth. 

"We get the pageants going 
and it's just another step up," 
Baczynski said.

Mr. Fell looked doubtful. He

"But I could leam so much

"Let me show you some-

I wanted nothing more than to 
go away to college, leaving behind 
me a ruthlessly abusive father and 
a mother who couldn't care less. 

I had dreams of acting, 
singing, studying psychology, .ind 
delving into creative writing and 
learning the art and technique of 
photography, so that I could even- 
tually exhibit my work. 

Unfortunately, I was far too 
shy even to get up on stage, sound- 
ed like a beagle howling when I 
sang, and had parents who had 
never intended to send me to col- 
lege... much less send me away. So 
I attended a local junior college. 

My parents said just to relax, 
since I had worked so hard to grad- 
uate by the age of sixteen and just 
to take some "fun" classes. So I took 
creative writing, photography, and 
some other classes of personal 
interest... under the assumption 
that 1 had all the time in the world. 

Bad idea. I did this for three 
years and mixed in some classes 
that would help me with my psy- 
chology degree, 
absolutely refused I 
four-year college,

bachelor's degree in psychology. 

Then they dropped the bomb. 
They and my sister would be mov- 
ing to Indiana in two years (upon 
my sister's graduation from high 
school). 

I was fine with that. I'd always 
wanted to move to Indiana to be 
near my more distant relatives: 
aunts, uncles, cousins, and grand- 
parents. The problem was that I 
had to "finish up" my schooling 
before I left Texas. 

Obviously, I could get nothing 
more than a two-year degree at the 
junior college I attended, and I was 
not interested in a single degree 
offered there. 

I escaped from home as much 
as possible... going out with 
friends, working and going to 
school. Anything to escape the 
daily beatings and the infliction of 
the bruises that covered my body. 
Even in the hundred degree sum- 
mers, 1 never wore shorts because I 
was so ashamed of my appearance. 

I decided to major in child 
development, but my heart wasn't 
in it. My grades remained As and 
Bs in the classes I had a personal 
interest in, but I got lower grades 
(including a few failures) in some 
of the "boring" classes. 

I realized that my parents 
honestly didn't care whether I went 
with them to Indiana or not. They 
informed me that "you can go if 
you want, but you won't be living 
in our house anymore." 

I was distraught. Working at a 
local grocery store, 1 made only 
about S3. 35 an hour. I would never 
be able to survive on my own mak- 
ing that little money. And what 
was more, I discovered that my sis- 
ter would be going away 
to college and studying at a major 
university... and that my parents 
would be paying her way. 

By the time we were to move, 
I had lost the few friends I'd had. 
Left with no other choice, 1 broke 
up with my boyfriend. I truly had 
nothing to look forward to... and 
there was no light at the end of the 
tunnel. 

I moved into a tiny, one-bed- 
room apartment in what one of my 
cousins described as a "dangerous" 
section of Fort Wayne... a place 
where within the past year, two 
murders had occurred and a place 
where drug dealers made their 
homes. Scared out of my mind, it 
often took several hours to get to 
sleep each night. 

I got a job as a cashier at a gro- 
cery store. Although minimum 
wage was much higher in Indiana 
than it was in Texas, it wasn't 
enough to live on. 

I hated my job and never had 
been one to make friends easily. 
Death seemed like a far superior 



choice. But I never tried to commit 
suicide. 

I made a couple of female 
friends, and we went to bars or 
read and wrote poetry together. 

I dated a couple of people, 
and one night at IHOP, 1 chanced to 
meet a college student who was 
studying photography. We talked 
until sunrise... about art, poetry, 
and everything under the sun. 

We started dating, and he 
urged me to go back to college. He 
explained to me about financial aid 
and how I may be able to go to 
school for free. 

I got information about 
returning to school, and applied to 
be a student at Indiana-Purdue 
University at Fort Wayne. 

But before I heard back from 
them, I found out that I was preg- 

I was thrilled at the idea that I 
was going to be a mother but terri- 
fied about my financial situation. 

I decided to wait until my 
child was in elementary school 
before I returned to school. My pri- 
mary focus was my baby. I wanted 
to spend as much time 
as possible with it and to be a good 
mother. 

... Now my son is six years old 
and in the first grade. He, his 
father, and I live in a three bed- 
room apartment... in a safe section 
of town. 1 work one job full-time, I 
work a second job 
one day a week, 
and I am a student 
taking six semes- 
ter hours at IPFW. 
I am majoring in 
psychology, and in 
the past year-and- 
a-half, 1 have had 
some of the finest 
instructors imagi- 

sidered a junior 
for about eleven 
years now, but I 
have a long way to 
go. I hope some- 
day to become a 
family counselor 
and possibly to go 
back and study 
further into abnor- 
mal psychology. 

But for me, 
school isn't just 
about getting a 
better job. It's 
about learning 
and getting to

Larry Life sheds light on Studio 
Theatre hauntings 



By Andrew Welfl- 
The Com mi 



Here's a piece of ll : PW trivia: Studio 
Theatre in Kettler I tail is reportedly haunted. 

Larry Life, chair and artistic director o( 
the Department of Theatre elaborates, "I came 
here in 1971. The students already knew there 
were ghosts in the theatre 

Life knows two »&gt;t the ghosl stories. 
Legend has it thai there was one student who 
drowned in a pool during .1 theatre parly during a 
production ol .1 show, Another was .1 student who, 
during .1 production, had a messy breakup with 
his girlfriend and gut in a fatal car crash. 

"lie was a very dedicated |llieatre| stu- 
dent and spent lets of time at Studio." said Lite 

"Do I think there are ghosts in the theatre? 
Yes I do. Have I seen them' Yes I have," said Life, 



Life reported other strange, more obvious appari- 
in the theatre. "There used to be a cos- 
shop in the basement under the stage, which 
we no longer have. (Costume shops moved to 
Williams Theatre after its construction.) You 
would often times go in there, and there would be 
people sitting at the cutting table that would gen- 
erally disappear. There have been numerous, 
numerous encounters with students over the 

Theatres ,ire notoriously known for being 
haunted. Jennifer Zamaites, the director of the 
Fort Wayne chapter ol the Indiana Ghost Trackers, 
explained, "It's probably because theatre people 
invest a lot of time and emotion into their work, 
and take a lot of pride in the theatre 'itself. Of 
course when they die some imprint of them 
would be left." 

Life agrees, "if you spent r

"Ghosts" 
Continued from Page 1 

Jennifer Zamaites, the 
director of the Fort Wayne 
chapter of the I.G.T., and her 
crew take this seriously. They 
aren't just some mystics with 
a flashlight and a Ouija 
board — she and her band of 
three trackers brought with 
them tape recorders, electro- 
magnetic field sensors, high- 
resolution digital cameras, 
and one of the coolest pieces 
of equipment I've ever 
seen — a high-tech digital 
thermometer that can read 
temperatures with laser pre-- 
cision from dozens of feet 

"A lot of times, we 
exceed people's expectations. 
Once they see we take this 
very seriously, they start to 
respect us," said Zamaites. 

Our first stop was the 
Studio Theatre in Kettler 
Hall. Even in the middle of 
the day, it is creepy to walk 
into a dark, empty auditori- 
um; at eight o'clock in the 
evening on a Saturday when 
the building is deserted, with 
the knowledge you are going 
to look for ghosts, it is even 
spookier. 

Upon entering the auditori- 
um, the trackers sprung into 
action. Zamaites passed out 
electromagnetic field read- 
ers. "If they start beeping, 
and you aren't around an 
electronic device, let us 
know," she said. If one beeps 
unexpectedly, it may help 
determine the location of a 

"Okay," a 

Communicator staff member 
said, waving the sensor 
around. 

Zamaites started taking pic- 
tures randomly with her 
handy Sony digital camera, 
checking the viewfinder 
afterwards for the presence 
of "orbs"— little balls of light 
that cannot be explained by 
dust on the lens or light 
reflections. 

"Often times, these are what 
parts of ghosts and spirits are 
visible, if only with the cam- 
era or camcorder," said 
Zamaites. 

Scott Smith, a Fort Wayne 
tracker, noticed a spot in the 
auditorium that smells 
strongly of perfume. "Is any- 
one wearing perfume or 



cologne?" "Well, there was definitely a

To Zamaites and Cox, it 
seemed as if the spirits were 
circling the clearing, in a very 
territorial manner. "They are 
being cautious," explained 

While in the clearing, 
Zamaites talked about her 
personal beliefs. 

"A lot of people are actu- 
ally openly hostile to our 
group. We all have different 
beliefs and methods. And 
although some of us don't 
agree with the way another 
operates, we don't judge or 
laugh at them," explained 
Zamaites. 

Zamaites and the other 
three ghost trackers that 
came to IPFW were all raised 
Christian. Zamaites finds the 
dynamic between her super- 
natural experiences and her 
traditional beliefs interesting. 

"It is a challenge to mesh 
the two," she said. 

It is easy to write off a 
ghost tracker investigation as 
a hoax. The sporadic patches 
of scent could be perfume 
soaked into the walls or the 
floors. Different tempera- 
tures can be explained by 
drafts. And heck, the ghost 
trackers could be lying about 
their sensations. 

But it COULD be true. 
Observers need to keep on

accept the Indiana Ghost "

"A lot of people are actu-

Jack Black plays himself in 'School 
of Rock/ Joan Cusack up to task 



f / 



Plus Special Guest

JANUARY 27.8PM 
SCOTTISH RITE CENTE 



When one hears the name "Jack Black," 
the words "heartwarming" and "endearing" 
do not generally come to mind. Usually, one 
would think of the words "crazy," or per- 
haps "mildly insane." 

Therefore, the fact that this ubiquitous 
performer was able to carry the unabashed- 
ly cute "The School of Rock" is beyond com- 
prehension. This movie will win no Oscar; it 
might even be lost in the annals of movie 
history. Yet minute for minute "School of 
Rock" will entertain the audience member 
far more than any movie to come out of 
Hollywood in recent months, if not years. 

The movie tells the journey of Dewey 
Finn (Jack Black), a rock star-wannabe who 
gets a second chance when he masquerades 
as a substitute teacher at an expensive prep 

To put it simply, Jack Black puts on a 
superb performance as himself. The adult 
supporting actors, sadly, were simply out- 
performed by the scene-stealing Black. 
There is one exception with Joan Cusack (as 
the principal of the prep school) who 
despite minimal screen time nearly 
matched Jack Black in dramatics. However, 
even the antics of Dewey Finn were 
upstaged by the young actors who com- 
prised the students of the prep school. 

The premise of the movie hinges on the 
virtuosic skills oi the vmrnj; students under 
Dewey Finn's charge; he takes this classical- 
ly trained musical talent and molds them to 



form a rock band. Elements of the script 
(such as the previous example) are indeed 
beyond belief (a class full of 10-year-old 
musical geniuses?) the writing of the script 
only rarely veers into the totally unbeliev- 
able; most of time, it simply remains in the 
realm of impossible. 

This is not necessarily a bad thing 
because of the positive aspects of the writ- 
ing A good deal of time was spent develop- 
ing the various characters within the script; 
this attention li&gt; character development was 
apparent across the board and kept the 
movie from overly focusing on just one 
character. 

The disparate elements of the movie 
and the unbelievable aspects of the script 
were carried not only by the acting, but by 
the music. "School of Rock" would not have 
achieved the caliber of entertainment it did 
without the musical talents of Jack Black. 
Music provided the background, and 
became the driving force of the movie. 

"School of Rock" hearkens back to the 
days when music was not only played but 
performed by actors. The selections chosen 
by the creators of the movie are generally 
recognizable, even to one such as myself, 
fundamentally unschooled in the classic 
rock genre. 

If I were to try and explain fully exact- 
ly why "The School of Rock" worked, I don't 
think I could. The separate aspects of the 
movie might appear lacking by themselves, 
but in combination with the whole movie 
experience, I felt that it was worth the full 
price ticket.

though.") and she used that same 
sensual voice. 

A cute, funny dance number 
was performed by Daisy Parocyz 
and Stefan Zubal, called "Cat and 
Mambo." It looked like something 
out of a 1960s Doris Day musical. 
Zubal was a suit-clad, glasses- 
wearing "square,",and Parocyz was 
a hot Latin dancer (with a dress cut 
up to THERE). There was a lively 
cha-cha (what sounded like the 
tune to "Papa Loves Mambo," but I 
can't be sure), and a tango (to 
Hernando's Hideaway" from the 
play, "Pajama Game"). Being a very 
big fan of those 60s musical num- 
bers, 1 loved it. 

Once again, a guest artist 
named Steven lannacone from 
Hope College performed a very 
painful looking interpretive dance 
number called "Meat." It had 
scratchy music, which sounded 
like a combination of sounds from 
natures and from a factory. The 
way he was contorting around the 
stage reminded me maybe of evo- 
lution, of a new life form learning 
how to walk. This is totally a per- 
sonal observation, but I guess that 
is why it's called "interpretive" 
dancing. Nonetheless, the muscu- 
lar lannacone was very good. 

One last segment I want to 
mention is "The Guys, 1 ' a two-part 
monologue (duologue \) performed 
by Susan Domer and Greg Bovles 
It was a very touching, almost fran- 
tic tribute to the victims of 9-11. 
Domer was Joan, the wife of a fire- 
man named Barney and a very con- 
cerned woman who would like to 
"just rewind the events, like a 
tape." Boyles was Nick, a fireman 
who was eulogizing at a memorial 
service for Barney, who was "good 
with his hands, had a tool for 
everything" and also died on the 
job during the terrorist attacks. 

The transitions between seg- 
ments were great, and (he lighting

A note, a simple, single note 

Paints the room in color. 

A key, a chord, a phrase, my palate, 

I paint with dots. 

Double sided portrait, 

Black and white, a rainbow of rich

Dots paint my world 

My fingers more swiftly over the

Sketching, painting, coloring the air. 



From moment to moment, the colors 

change. 

A warm sunrise, orange and yellow, 

Nerves, painted black and green, 

The soft pink of loves first kiss 

Striking red of heartfelt passion. 

Green in envy's eyes. 

Blue of tears and sorrows, 

White redemption and absolution. 

Colors fly from my fingertips as they 

glide across the keys, 

Painting the air with music.

IPFW Softball 
a 'big hit' in 
the classroom 

By IPFW News Services 

The National Fastpitch 
Coaches Association has released 
its 2002-2003 list of All-Acad. 
Teams, and the IPFW Softball team 
has been recognized for outstand- 
ing work in the classroom. 

Only 80 Division-I teams 
were eligible for the honor, and 
IPFW ranked 41st 
GPA of 3.18. That ranked the 
Mastodons ahead of such schools 
as Stanford, Michigan State, 
Kansas, and Kentucky. 

IPFW also had five players 
recognized as NFCA All-America 
Scholar-Athletes. They are: Mindy 
Pomeroy- Pitcher; Holly McNally- 
P-OF; Crystal Fisher-Catcher; Lori 
Faurote-Outfielder; Jenna Beachy- 
C-OF. 

To qualify for the individ- 
ual honor, the student-athlet&lt; 
possess a 3.5 GPA or higher for the 
academic year listed. 

The Divisii 
ings ranged from Indiana State, at 
the top, with a 3.466, to Kentucky 
with a team GPA of 2.72.

Lady Volleydons on 
verge of 20-win seas on 



By Nick West 
The Communicator 

Coming into this season, IPFW 
women's head volleyball coach 
Kellev Hartley had high expecta- 
tions for her team. After all, the 
L.uiy Don.- finished the season as 
Division I Independent champi- 
ons in their first season as a 
Division I team. 

So last Tuesday when the team 
hailed Mid-Continent Conference 
(MCQ leader Valparaiso's (19^) 
eight-match winning streak, she 
was not overly surprised. 

"We have what we feel is a 
leant that can win 20 game&gt;, said 
Hartley, 

At 15-9, the team needs to 
come out on top in five of its last 
eight games to meet Hartley's 
admittedly lofty standards. 

"A couple of weeks ago, our 
coaching staff reassessed that goal 
and determined this team was 
capable of more." She added, "We 
have challenged the team to aim 
for a 20 win season and they are 
excited and have accepted that 
challenge." 

A 20-win season for most any 
college sport is a remarkable feat. 



"Our kids are fired up," she 
said. " They have the right atti- 
tude. They aren't complaining 
about a conference or anything 
else like that. Instead, they come 
to the gym, want to get better as 
athletes, and want to win as many 
matches as they can." 

With six victories in a row, 
Hartley l eels the Lady 'Dons are 
peaking at the right time. 

"Though we have some tough 



letes are confident and continuing 
to po-h each other," she said. 

After defeating conference 
leader Valparaiso, the team is 3-1 
against MCC schools. Earlier in 
the season, the team battled heav- 
ily favored MAC champion Ball 
State, but inevitably fell in a five- 
match epic. Still, the team is 4-3 
against schools from the confer- 
ence. And with the recent victory 
over Horizon League powerhouse 
Butler, the 
team is 3-2 
against that 
conference. 
"It is just excit- 
ing that so

Men's soccer loses 
in2-OTthriller 

By IPFW News Services 

The IPFW men's soccer 
team wasted a furious comeback 
last Thursday evening at the 
Hefner Soccer Field. The 
Mastodons overcame a two-goal 
deficit, only to lose to Aquinas 
College 4-3 in double overtime 
thriller in their final home game 
of the season. 

The Saints started the 
scoring at the 6 minute mark.

Aquinas senior forward Jimmy 
Allis put the Saints up by the 
score of 3-1 at the half. 

In the second half, the 
Mastodons kept most of the play 
in the Aquinas end. Junior for- 
ward Seth Fishelson took a feed 
from freshman Andy Boesch,
