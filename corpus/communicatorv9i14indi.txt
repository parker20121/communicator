CHEVETTES 

ARE HERE 




They're a lot more car for 
a lot less money/ 

Astounding, but true! The 78 Chevettes offer you even more car for less 
money than last year. We added 1 7 new standard features and still kept the 
price below last year's Chevette with the same equipment. 

Here are a few of the new standard features included on the 78 Chevette! 
For starters, you get^ peppy 1 .6 Litre engine. And an AM radio. For looks, 
there are items like white stripe tires, sport steering wheel, body side 
moldings, deluxe grille, wheel trim rings . . . more! 

You get all this added to last year's standard equipment. 

The '78 Chevy Chevette. More than ever, it's a big value small car. 

'Comparison of manufacturer's suggested retail price for a 1977 Chevette Coupe with 
features now standard on a 1978 Chevette Coupe.
