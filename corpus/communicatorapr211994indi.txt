Volunteer opportunities available to students

School will be out toon, and if col- 
lege student] ire looking for a new pur- 
suit ihii tummer break, they might be 
Interested lo letm of the hundreds of 
kids looking for someone like yourself 
lo spend a few hours together. 

The Dig Brothers/Big Sisters pro- 
gram (BB/BS) matches area youth 
(oges 7 lo 15), from primarily single- 
parent homes with adult volunteers. 

These volunteers commit to spend- 
ing a few hours with n child enrolled in 
Ihc program, iwo to four times a 
monlh. Volunteers serve as friends, 
confidantes and positive role models to 
the children. 

I In; organization has several volun- 
teer programs, although the one most 
familiar, the One to One Match, is the 
program most people think of when 
they consider joining the organization, 

As Hi': name implies, an adult vol- 
unteer is matched with one child in the 
hope that an ongoing, mature relation- 
ship will develop. A commitment of at 
least one year is required lo qualify for 
this program. 

The process or becoming o Big 
Brother of Big Sister is very intense 
and very slow. The first step is filling 
out the application. 

According to Dave Hall, a case- 
worker for BB/BS, the reference sec- 
tion is probably the most important. 
Among the references, applicants must 
in their employer (or a clergy person). 
One cannot list any family members, as 
references however, and each reference 
is checked thoroughly by BB/BS. 

The candidate must go through two 
interviews. The first is done at Ihc 
BD/DS office. This interview generally 
covers family background, education, 
relationships with people, work and 
medical history. 

The second interview is conducted 
at the candidate's home. In this inter- 
view, the BB/BS representative meets 
his/her family members and checks out 
the home with regard to certain safely 
factors. Each interview can average I 
1/2 to 2 hours. 

The BB/BS agency also checks for 
criminal history, insurance coverage 
and driving records. All the informa- 
tion is needed to run a thorough check 
on all prospective volunteers since chil- 
dren arc involved. All information 
given to BB/BS is confidential. 

BB/BS began in 1903 and spread to 
both coasts when businessman Irvin 
Wcslheimer befriended a fatherless boy 
who was scavenging in a garbage can. 
With this image in his head, 
Wcslheimer then proceeded lo launch 
the Big Brother program. 

In 1904, the Big Sister program was 
started by Mrs. Willard Parker, with 
support from Lody Armstrong, The two 
programs officially joined to form Big 
Brothers/Big Sisters in 1977. 

Locally. Big Brothers of Greater 
Fort Wayne was established in 1972; 
Big Sisters was added in 1975. 

In 1978, BB/BS of Grcalcr Fort 
Wayne was accepted as a full member 
of BB/BS of America, and currently 
serves eight counties; Allen, Dekalb, 
Noble, LaGrange, Steuben, Adams, 
Wells, Huntington and Whitley, with 
satellite offices in each. 

Wendy Smith is a junior al IPFW 
studying elementary education. She is 
big sister to Diana, age 10. (For confi- 
dentiality, only Diana's first name can 
be given). 

Wendy and her "little sister" were 
matched up with similar interests — 
rollerblading and movies. They spend 
between 2-4 hours together per week, 
sometimes more, depending on their 
schedules. 

Smith participates in the program 
because she enjoys kids and found Ibis 
lo be a good way lo help kids and enjoy 
herself al the some time. She says her 
cousin was also a Big Sister. 

Smith went through a training pro- 
gram to learn how to deal wilh poten- 
tial problems, such as behavioral prob- 

Diana likes to go to ihc movies and 
arcades. She wailed two years for this 
match, and she has been paired with 
Smith for one year. 

Price breaks are good for college 
students. Smith said. The two enjoy 
going to Pizza Hut for the two'for-one 
price deals. Other price-breaks can be 
used st local bowling alleys, skating 
rinks, movies and area restaurants. 

The First Friends Program is a pro- 
gram run on a volunteer basis. Il was 
created lo make Ihe wailing a little cas - 



In this program, an adult volu 
is grouped with two or three youths for 
agency- supported activities. The volun- 
teer is asked to commit their lime only 
twice per monlh for a minimum of st* 
months, and many volunteers arc need- 
ed for various volunteer activities, such 
as driving kids lo events. Kristen 
Johnson is the caseworker for Wendy 
and Diana as well as a student at IPFW 
and talks about the First Friends 
Program. 

"We ask for one lime per month and 
it doesn't cost the volunteer anything — 
it's agency sponsored," said Johnson. 



Presently. there are 200 kids on Ihe 
waiting list — some kids have been wail- 
ing for as long as three yean. 

BB/BS does not match kids accord- 
ing lo how long they have been on Ihe 
list, "We match personality as well as 
strengths and weaknesses." said 
Johnson. 

A former "little brother" who 
enjoyed Ihe benefits of the One lo One 
Match is Mark Poffenburger. He is 
presently a senior studying computer- 
science al IPFW and will be graduating 
in December 1994. 

Poffenburger slates he had a big 



brother from Ihe ages of 7-18. When 
bewas 18. bis big brother moved lo 

His big brother was like a father fig- 
ure lo him as Poffenberger's father left- 
at a young age. Poffenburger says his 
big brother was someone to talk to. 

Poffenburger has Ihree kids of his 
own now, but stilt participates inBB/BS 
fundraising activities, like the 
Bowlaihon. 

For more information, call the 
agency al 456-1600.

Writer needs a 
lesson in romance 

To the editor. 

Haven't you ever shared an inti- 
mate picnic of champagne and straw- 
berries in the center of an open field? 
Haven't you ever made love in the 
depth and darkness of a secluded for- 
est? Haven't you ever been to the 
Candlelight Cafe, if only to discuss 
the theater and the paradox of the 
stage with your Significant Other, 
over a glass of Kir? Haven't you ever 
been in Love? 

I was appalled, insulted, by Kristie 
Scblundt's article, "Is romance essen- 
tial in a working marriage?" She 
claims that "romantic love is not 
teal," it is unpatriotic [being "decid- 
edly French in origin") and unrealis- 
tic, and to be "labeled a romantic is an 
insult" Excuse me? 

Being both French AND a 
Romantic (God forbid), I was quite 
offended by the article. As a poet, 1 
have always placed great emphasis on 
Beauty and Truth and 1 have found 
intense inspiration in (he midst or that 
strange and complex emotion called 
Love. Ms. Schlundt rambles on and 
on about the superficial nature of 
romantic Love, comparing it to Ihe 
matter in Harlequin novels and James 
Bond movies. Obviously, she has yet 
to experience the close bond which 
transcends candlelight and red roses. 
Romance stems from a keen aware- 
ness of another's emotional needs and 
selfless desire to express an abstrac- 
tion. A lack of romance in marriage is 
a result of careless indifference. 

Schlundt also makes the mundane 
contrast between emotion and reason, 
claiming that its either/ or. But it's 
never either/or. One need not triumph 
over the other but should, rather, fuse 
together and blossom side by side. 
Romance is intellectual, Ii is (or 
should be ) a sharing of ideas, a 
blending together of two separate 
minds. Don't you see? 

I agree with her statement that 
romance is obsessive. But obsession 
is merely an extreme and powerful 
feeling for something. Il is nol neces- 
sarily "unnatural," All of the artistic 
giants of tbe past. Shakespeare. 
Dostoevski, Mozart, etc, were 
obsessed over something that mat- 
tered. They were brilliant, they were 
romantics, they were in Love. Vive L' 
Amour!! Tessa Gochtovn 



To the editor. 

By chance I happened to read an 
issue of your paper. As a freelance fea- 
ture writer. I have interest in differing 
writing styles. I was rather amazed with 
the cartoon featured by Sarah Meyers. 
In fact. I was unsure as to whom she 
intended to offend, I have learned it is 
critical lo do one's research. Having 
done several pieces on Native 
Americans. I am confused as to why 
Ms. Meyers would utilize aspects of the 
Native religion as the woman in the tra- 
ditional Pose of prayer would imply. 
Unlike our while culture, native women 
have long been active as tribal ciders 
and medicine women. As she is praying 
with her back toward Washington, is il 
to be presumed Ms. Meyers is implying 
the "savages" have turned their back on 
the United States? Further, as native 
people consider the buffalo sacred- 
could it be she implies the death of all 



native values? 

On tbe other band, if the cartoon 

Americans, as a woman, I find whole 
barefoot, pregnant, and in the kitchen, 
or tanning hides if you prefer, repug- 
nant. The dictionary definition for sav- 
age is, "wildly uncivilized; brutal; a 
vicious or crude person." Since good 
old George died of venereal disease and 
Martha didn't, il seems he wasn't truly 
in any position to coll anyone else "sav- 
age." As one of the white majority, I do 
not find it something to be proud of to 
have token advantage of a race by trad- 
ing on their good nature and trusting 
souls. This is a time when all people of 
all races ore struggling for acceptance 
for their own unique talents and her- 
itages. 1 must admit lhal the use of 
"savages" nol only lacks good taste, il 
is poor editorial judgment. 

Satire is defined as "use of mockery, 
or bumor in a literary work to 



ridicule or attack human vice." It is n 
cultivated talent that until mastered 
lacks validity. Always, il is necessary lo 
insure that the object of the insult is 
clearly understood. 

However, perhaps I am being too 
harsh. I am sure The Communicaior is 
but d student newspaper after all, and 
one must learn somewhere. (game) I 
would have thought though that some 
older and wiser heads would have had 
some insight. Ambiguity always leaves 
a bad taste in the mouth of Ihe reader 
and reflects badly on the author and 
editor. I would be quite surprised if 
there were not many outraged lelters. 
You sec, Ihis is not a Native issue, it is 
a human rights issue. How would a 
child of a Native decent feel aboul this 
cartoon? It is a question that, in my 
opinion, should have been asked prior 
to publication. Point taken?

Reader tired of monotony 



I recently bad tbe disheartening 

experience of reading several of your 
weekly papers for the first time. The 
blatant lack of professionalism was so 
striking that I feel compelled to reply. 

Not only were Ihe grammar and 
spelling improper, but Ihe writing was 
uncrcative, unoriginal, incredibly weak 
attempt at making the same point over 
and over again. It was hardly surprising 
to find Ihe appeal in your March 24. 
edition: "staff writers needed." No kid- 
ding? 

Tbcrc are many different issues of 
great concern and interest to the stu- 
dents at Ibis university. Il would be 
nice if you could diversify. All things 
arc nol a matter of black against white 
(or white against black, as you obvi- 
ously prefer.) The proble 



white people 



l handle" the black 



'power" of the paper, as was stated by 
editors Ramona Mcgown and F, Lane 
Douse on March 31 It is simply lhal 
many readers arc gelling lired of the 
monotony. 

I have been subjected to discrimina- 
tion many times in my life and I cer- 
tainly understand the need to address 
racism. Bui your derogatory, immature, 
sarcastic, and many times mean-spirit- 
ed comments do not reach out to any- 
one. Pilling one race against another is 
far from accomplishing peace among 
all cultures. 

Everything is nol black and while: 
please slop labeling. Your writers are 
often too judgmental. Have an open 
mind. Try, fresh, brief, stronger state- 
ments when teaching an issue. Better 
still, try new issues. 

Your credibility would definitely be 



served if your grammar were 
improved. I have to wonder bow many 
of your staff writers attended any 
English class above W131. and what 
grades Ihcy might have received in 
those classes ihe grammar, as well as 
the elementary, simplistic and mundane 
wniing style is so poor that you may 
want 10 consider using a well trained 
assistant for a while It certainly 
couldn't hurt. 

Please understand lhal this comes 
from someone who is deeply concerned 
for people of all cultures. You arc in a 
position lo help fashion a better soci- 
ety. Work for il. Don'l jusisil at a desk 
and hurl sbaltow, empty insults. We 
can get plenty of that anywhere etse. 
M.Haffner 



Blacks need to look at self 



Although I and many of my fellow 
classmates think of this so-called news- 
paper as an absolute rag, recent 
columns by tbe paper's staff has 
prompted me to write. With nearly 
every column lhat I read by such "writ- 
ers" as F. Lace Douse, there seems lo 
be absolutely no reality to wbat they 

Mr. Douse, do you realize that most 
of the white/European Americans living 
in America today are immigrants or just 
a few generations shy of being immi- 
grants themselves? Furthermore most 
of these European immigrants came to 
Ihe U.S. in the last one hundred years- 
especially with the end of World War 
n My family, and many oihcre, bad no 
direct link with slavery. In fact, my 
grandmother was taken from her home 
in Poland to tbe German farm fields 
to be a slave. 

Mr. Douse, do you think thai there 
is any real racial tension anymore? 
When I say "real racial tension" I mean 
not getting a job because you are black 
or not gelling served because you ore 
black. WelL as for as jobs go, there isn't 
any racial tension because the govern- 
ment requires companies to hire minori- 
ties. Alio, I never hear of uy black 
person nol getting served simply 
because he is black. 

In reality, there is some tension sur- 
rounding tbe black race-but not because 
of color. I find thai the character of the 
dominant black culture to be sickening, 
and so do many others Nol only are 
black males more likely to die before 



the age of 27, but also they are more 
likely to be a victim of homicide by 
another black male. My numbers may 
be a little off however, if you doubt the 
idea it presents-look it up yourself- Il 
even seems thai success by a black man 
in this dominant black culture is nol 
liked, in fact tbey call them oreos. 
Black on the outside, while on the 
inside. Obviously, your not really black 
if your successful-so says the dominant 
black culture, not me. And with tbe fur- 
ther breakdown of the traditional black 
family, more problems are to be expect- 
ed and are occurring. But I have neither 
the lime nor the desire to discuss it right 
now (Read Eleanor Holmes Norton). 

Mr. Douse, I think you will under- 
stand my position better if you under- 
stand where I'm coming from. In mid- 
dle school I got picked on because I 
was white. Try and find lhat in a news- 
paper or on TV. I also teamed never to 
turn your back lo blacks you don'l 
know ] realized lhat what blacks may 
have lacked in being a good student, 
tbey made up for by being suooger. 
bigger, and more cruel Furthermore, 
you never came up to a black person 
who said, "come bere" lhat you didn't 
know. For three years, I was scared and 
intimidated every day in middle school- 
There was no way a smalL overweight, 
bookworm, like me could defend 
myself. 1 agree thai this is all in the past 
and that I have forgiven all of those 
who did me wrong. However, much of 
die things thai I have teamed in middle 
school seem to come back lo challenge 



By now, I'm sure your wondering 
whether or not I am a racist. I am not 
However, Mr, Douse, the line thai sepa- 
rates racists from non-racist now blurs 
for me every time I go to work- I work 
in a fast food place on South Calhoun. 
If you really warn to get in touch with 
many cultures as tbey really are. work 
at fast food place (especially in the 
south part of the town). After you get 
robbed a few limes, at gunpoint I might 
add. I think your ideals will change 

Mr. Douse. I cannot and will not be 
a racist but I will be suspicious. I will 
be suspicious because of what I have 
observed of the black culture. Like I 
said. I grew up and still live in the south 
port of town. I went to Geyer Middle 
School and to Wayne High School. 
both are predominately black. I have 
many black friends and I work io * 
dominantly black establishment. So I 
know "what's up" with tbe dominate 
black culture And you can't tell me 
otherwise because I lived in it, and I 
still do. 

Can we both agree lhal living in the

To the editor. 

In the ideals of higher learning and 
wisdom, (he wise owl comes to the 
minds of many, but with the way peo- 
ple act you would think Ibcy were 
ostriches with tbctr heads in the sand. 
If I don't see the problem It doesn't 
exist or you're making a mountain out 
of .1 molehill just to deny important 
issues that confront them. 

Prejudice. Intolerance, and 
Ignorance must be swept away to allow 
inroads to be made by all. Issues arc 
blurred by colorful words like Wop, 
Dike, Spile, or Nigger, but we must be 
politically correct and use Bigot or 
Racist. My father is from Mississippi 
and my mother is from Virginia, and I 
was the first person in my family to go 
to a university where freedom of 
expression is o cherished jewel. What's 
agitating is when I hear a while person 
call another person "Boy" or say 
"That's mighty white of you." I was 
raised in Virginia in the 60's, I know 
Ihe true meaning of each, and it is 
something I would not wish on my 
worst enemy, let alone a friend. I work

Doran questions fame of General Mad Anthony Wayne 



Picture this: the Allen County War 
morial Coliseum, a huge, imposing 

structure in a Midwestern city, an All 
rica City, a Most Livable City, t 

City of Churches. The scene is a party 

for kids celebrating the birthday of its 

founder, General "Mad" Anthony 

Wayne. What did he do to earn such 
asting gratitude and affection? He 

killed people. Indians 10 be precise. 

Killed them on orders from President 

George Washington. 

And what terrible crime bad Ihe 
Hans committed? They refused to 

give up tbeir land they had been living 
; centuries before Mad and bis 

gang were even born. When Wayne got 



he call, the 



tent i 



li,-u 



Kekionga, and tbe situation was desper- 
I ci by their great war chief. Little 
Turtle, the Miami's and assorted other 
tribes handed U.S. forces several bumii- 
ating defeats. But by the time Wayne 
arrived from out cast in (be early 1790s, 
Little Turtle bod resigned from combat 
was advocating peace. Without 
their brilliant leader, tbe Indians lost, 
and the winners wrote Ihe accounts of 
attics and changed the name from 
Kekionga to Fort Wayne, 

According to the first settlers, these 

lavages, as wc whiles liked lo coll 

them, lived, without jails, orphanages. 

old people's homes. No wonder they 

d to he cleared out to make way for 



cn'l killed 
were placed on reservations within the 
state that would come to be known as 
Indiana, "land of Indians," and eventu- 
ally moved by force to far and distant 
lands out wesL 

When I have been so impolite as to 
point this out-thu city name and what it 
means in mixed company. I bear. "It's 
in the past so wbal's the point of bring- 
ing it up now?" 

Yes, Wayne may be in tbe post, but 
his legacy is quite firmly placed in the 
present After all, the city still bears his 
name, parties arc thrown in bis honor, 
and the thinking ibai inspired and 
fueled bis genocide, and Ihe religion 
ibat justified it. remain intact. Consider, 
according to ihe Children's Defense 
Fund, almosl 50,000 children were 
killed by guns between 1979-1991, 
nearly as many as all U.S. causalities in 
the Vietnam war. A child dies from 
gunshot wounds every two hours and 
close to IS million live in poverty, 
making children the poorest group in 
America. 

In 1992, Indiana reported 78,000 
coses of child abuse and neglect, pari of 
tbe almost three million reported 
nation-wide. Black infants suffer a mor- 
tality rate higher than 31 other nations, 
including Cuba, Bulgaria and Kuwait. 
And Ihe U.S. joins an elite group of 
nations in not signing the U.N. 
Convention on Ihe Rights of the Child: 
Cambodia, Iran, Iraq, Libya, and South 
Africa are ihe others. The dreary list of 



n the American character goes 

Here in General Wayne's city, for 
example, we experienced a record num- 
ber of homicides in 1993. most of 
which, according to Ken Watson, chief 
juvenile probation officer, take place in 
east central. Of those who survive, 
many end up in prison. In the land of 
the free, there are more people caged up 
than in any clber industrialized country. 
According lo syndicated columnist 
Colman McCarthy, of the 1.2 million 
people now incarcerated, more than 70 
percent arc functionally illiterate. Ycl

e shot 



t that 



:cidh 



rales, which range between 60 and 70 
percent in most states, are cut by as 
much as 80 percent among those who 
completed tbeir education while behind 

And how much money did President 
Bill Clinton allocate for education in 
crime prevention? Zero, but millions 
for more prisons and more police. 
Meanwhile, every 12 seconds of the 
school day, an American child drops 
oul of school. Am I the only one sens- 
ing a pattern here? When answers ore 
so obvious and yet arc ignored, I can 
only conclude that poverty and 
wretchedness in America is as dcliber* 
ate and willful as the destruction of the 
Indian, The only difference is that now. 
200 years later, wc have goltcn better at 
disguising our true intent.

Alternative view 

Love may fill 'hole' 
left by Cobain 



by Jamie Craver 
Staff Writer 

With the very unfortunate passing 
t (he never- wanted- to- he -a -rock -s lax 
Kun Cobain we have lo« one of the 
linger/Jong writer* thai nol only 
ipoke lincerely lo a lost and disap- 
pointed generation bul actually was 

With the newly released album by 
wife's 
(Courlney Love) 
band 'Hole,' there 
the some conse- 
nt trend of loudly 
iilurbing music 
which contains the 
sincere lyri- 
cal feelings of an 
unfair world let out 
through Ibe defi- 
:ly vivacious 
vocals of Courtney 
Love. 

Love also 
plays guiUr on the 

fellow members 
Eric Eriandson on 
guitar, Patty 

Schemes on 

is, and Kristcn Pfaff on bass, 
piano, and background vocals. 

Hole's first major label album is 
tilled ' Live Through This' and is 
rything you would expect from 
Courtney Love. 

Hole, while maintaining their own 
originality and style, display similari- 
ties lo a number of bands. On many of 

ongs the loud, vicious sound of 
the band and the vocals of Love are 
similar to that or 'Babes in Toyland' 

he vocals of Kat Bjelland who 



could pass for Love'f sister. In fact, 
Bjelland helped write the song 'I 
Think That 1 Would Die' on the 

The &gt;ong 'Jennifer's Body' lakes 
on a sound very much like that of 
'Concrete Blonde' while the mar- 
velously wild 'She Walks On Me' 
Hole sounds like Nirvana with 
Courtney Love on vocals.

on a lighter

affective songs on the album. 

Overall Hole comes through with 
a winner with 'Live Through This,' 
So anyone who is really depressed 
with the fact that (here will never be 
another Nirvana album, may I suggest 
trying out Hole, a band that is just as 
powerful and creative 

Look next week for my review of 
the Violent Fcmmcs concert that will

A dose 
of Douse.. 
Are we 
"invisible?" 

by f. Lane Douse 
Featura Edllor 

"I am an invisible man." 

These words taken from Ralph 
Ellison's great novel. "The Invisible 
Man." still remain true in 1994. 

Recently on campus, the Black 
Collegiate Caucus held a forum for 
open discussion on (he content of The 
Communicator Ramona Mcgown, edi- 
tor in chief of the Communicator, and I 
both entertained questions concerning 
tbe editing of articles, journalistic 
ethics, management of The 
Communicator, and of course the regu- 
lar "I don't wont my money going into 
trash like this" complaint. 

I found it so amazing how people 
criticized me for abusing freedom of 
speech. How can anyone abuse some- 
one else's right to free speech. I don't 
censor people. 1 don't have that power. 
Yet, I find people wanting to censor 
me or monitor what I write. Now, who 
is abusing whose freedom of speech. 
Students who want the power of the 
press need to write for The 
Communicator and express themselves 
just I am doing. 

Then, there was the criticism 
brought by the professor about how we 
didn't cover the Chancellor's Search 
Committee. Yel, the professor fails to 
realize thai (he staff of the 
Communicator is limited. We only 
have about six people. 

I guess, this really shouldn't con- 
cern me, but it does because more peo- 
ple become concerned with what is 
covered by the Communicator because 
we are African- Americans in tbe so- 
called power position. Every time 
African -Americans get in these posi- 
(ions of power, folks expect them (o 
become "Supcmjggas."

Notes from Wost... 

Reflections about Hispanic, 
Latin Americans, Latinas women 




their societies Despite (he fac( (hat 
more and more women in Spanish- 
speaking countries are "taking control" 
((o quote (he (itlc of a book by Mary 
Helen Ponce) of their lives, the stereo- 
type of tbe Hispanic/Latin 
American/Latin a woman as passive 
and subservient is still very much 
ingrained in the way many think. 

In reality, so many Hispanic 
women from all walks of life hove 
become living testimony to the human 
spirit. I'm thinking now of all the . 
women in Argentina. Chile, 
Guatemala. Honduras, and El Salvador 



of Ibe 1992 Nobel 
Peace Prize, hon- 
ored for her efforts through (he United 
Nations to stop (he genocide carried 
oui against her people, the Maya, for 
over 35 years; (he Mothers of the 
Plaza dc Mayo, women from all social 
classes who continue to stroll around 
(he symbol of Argentine community 
life to press for (he knowledge of their 
missing sons, daughters, husbands, 
and grandchildren; (he Children arpil- 
leristos whose strength to survive eco- 
nomically the disappearance of fumily

Theatre review 

'Oh Dad, Poor Dad' displays wonderfully demented humor 



by Jamie Craver 
Staff Writer 

What has Venus Fly Traps. Siamese 
cat eaiing piranha, a dead husband 
hanging in a closei and plenty of 
laughs? Indiana- Purdue ' r &gt; theatre main- 
stage production of 'Oh Dad. Poor 
Dad. Mammas Hung You in the Closei 
and I'm Feelin' so Sad' of course! 

This twisted comedy by Arthur L- 
Kopit ilaru off with the elegantly sinis- 

Madame Rosepetlle. ( WPTA-TV 21 
Alive's Melissa Long), and ber slmngc. 
slow minded son Jonathan. (IPFW's 
own Jon Mitchell), moving into an 
expensive condo in Port Royal, a city 
somewhere in the Caribbean. 

One tremendously humorous seg- 
ment in this opening scene is when 
Madame Rosepcltle finds out Ibal one 
of the bellboy's has fed her pet piranha 
on alley cat Rosepetlle rants and raves 
because she only feeds ber fish Siamese 
cats, and preferably Siamese cal kittens 
because they arc more tender. And then 
you can bear the fish let out a huge 
belch because of the indigestion caused 
by low grade alley cat. 

All (he while, Jonathan is crawling 
along the floor with his head tilled in a 
crooked manner, adjusting his wire 
rimmed glasses lo watch the bellboys 
putting their things in order. 

In the next scene, Rosalie, a young 
girl visitor (played beautifully by 
Bcckic Niccum.) is sent to sec 



Jonathan Rosalie is a short girl with 
blond hair and a very high whiny voice. 

Poor Jonathan, wbo docs not speak 
well, stutters and stammers to Rosalie 
aboul bow his job is to lake care of the 
Venus Fly Traps and bow be has 
watched Rosalie many limes through 
his home-made telescope Rosalie finds 
him amusing and tncs lo seduce him. 

Then you can hear the cuckoo go off 
and Jonathan begs Rosalie lo leave but 
it is loo late. Madame Rosepeltle 
appears in her evening atlirc and tells 
Rosalie thai she has been listening lo 
the entire conversalion 

Rosepcltle at this moment looks 
something like the bride of 
Frankenstein and orders Rosalie lo 
leave, Jonathan's mother explains that 
her son is never to leave the confines of 
the condo (to protect his innocent mind 
and snowy white body from the harmful 
rays of sunlight, bird droppings falling 
from trees, and from slu(s like Rosalie.) 
In Ibe second act. Madame 
Rosepcltle is entertaining the very rich 
Commodore Roseabove (John Bcll). 
Madame RosepeUle shows the 
Commodore her picture slides and 
describes her rocky marriage lo her laic 
husband and her strong negative reel- 
ings to sex, love and the sinful outside 
world. 

There is a humorous moment when 
she shows the picture of Jonathan right 
after bis birth. He looks just as old ss 
he was then, supposedly because of her 



twelve- month pregnancy. She tells the 
Commodore of bow ber husband never 
seemed to notice her pregnancy and that 
she did not want him to know so she 
hid Jonathan in a cage. 

The whole lime Madame hints jok- 
ingly thai she killed her husband, and 
she finally scares off the Commodore 
when she leUs him with a wicked smile 
that ber husband is hanging in the clos- 
et. 

In the next scene. Jonathan is hav- 
ing a dream sequence in which the bell- 
boys, Rosalie, their blind piano player, 
the Venus Fly Trap and Ibc piranha are 
oil chasing him. The tights flash madly 
off and on and the sequence ends when 
the Venus Fly Trap kills Rosalie. 

The costumes were great for all Ibe 
characters, but none were as impressive 
as the costumes worn by Ibe IPFW 
actresses Sarah Forbing and Avilla 
Myrice wbo artistically brought lo life 
Ibe Venus Fly Trap and the piranha dur- 
ing Jonathan's nightmarish dream 
sequence. 

Then in (be final scene Rosalie 
returns (o visit Jonathan while his moth- 
er Is out on Ibe beaches kicking sand in 
the faces any lovers she finds on the 

Rosalie frightens Jonathan by enter- 
ing his mother's bedroom and laying on 
her bed. Rosalie strips off her clothes 
and displays nothing but ber sexy lin- 
gerie. 

She finally persuades the hysterical- 



ly frightened Jonathan onto the bed and 
tells him thai everything his mother bad 
warned him aboul her was true Then 
just as i( seems that Rosalie will get 
what the wants from Jonathan, the Jejd 
body of the late Mr. Albert Rosepeltle, 
played by a dark eyed Mark Snyder. 
falls out of the closei onto the bed. 

Rosalie. Hill in Ihe heal of Ibe 
moment, simply remarks aboul what a 
stupid place the closet is lo put a dead 
body and jumps back on (op of 
Jonathan Jonathan, who is not a liable 
person lo begin wilh, finally cracks, and 
in a stale of madness lakes a pillow and 
smothers Rosalie. 

At ihe end of ihe play, Madame 
Rosepetlle comes home and, nol show- 
ing very much shock at what has hap- 
pened, comforts her poor, tightly-kcp( 

The play was directed beautifully 
by IPFW's Larry L. Life ond ihere is 
never a dull moment 

Jon Michel! and Bcckie Niccum 
steal the show as the delightfully 
strange young Jonathan and Rosalie, 
and Melissa Long is flawless in her por- 
trayal of Ihe beautiful but demented 
Madame Rosepetlle. 

There were many, many laughs in 
this dark comedy that ai limes made 
you wonder how you could laugh at 
something so sod. Indiana-Purdue's 
Department of Theatre did a wonderful 
job with ihis different but thoroughly 
entertaining comedy.

Personally speaking, what you drive 
says a lot about who you ore. So why 
not say you're one of the most exciting, 
fun-loving, even sensible people going? 
In other words, why not say it with a 
sporty new Ford or Mercury? 

Now's the perfect time to make a 
personal statement— because the 1994 
Ford S Mercury College Graduate 
Purchase Program** gives you your choice 
of $400 cash back or a special 
finance rate* when you buy a new 
Ford or Mercury. Or lease your vehicle 
and get $400 cosh bock! 



Plus, Ford Credit can offer qualified 
applicants pre-approved credit up to 
$18,000 or the MSRF; whichever is 
lower, which could mean no down pay- 
ment on finance purchases. You may also 
defer purchase payments for 120 days 
in most states (excluding Michigan, 
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Washing- 
ton, DC). 

So take time out to see your Ford or 
Lincoln-Mercury dealer today and ask 
about the College Graduate Purchase 
Program. (Ifs a terrific way to show the 
world just how smart you really are 1 .)

Ttmr-I.n y-il ;i I'i'u 



Do*e continued from page 4.. 
(For lh(*£ of you who do not Icnow whfll 
I im Hiking about when I lay 
"Supemigjs." T am referring !o a penon 
of color who hn» allowed Ihe while 






:p ,'.. line himidf for hin 



id h..n allowed ilirm lo control what he 
icei, how he (eeli. and what he myi. 
Thli penon li alwoyi running around 
doing whatever while folks uy needs lo 
he done.) 

Well, 1 lubtnil ihnt I will not allow 
ihii eampui or in occupanti define my 
in.' on Ihii campui ax a penon or as 
Joumallil. So, Ihc Chancellor'* Search 
Committee wam'l covered, big deal! 
liven If we did. would iludenti have a 
valid voice in eiprening their concern 
for who the chancellor would be? Excuic 
me, but why didn't Ihc search committee 
lend one of Ihe four names of ihe 
African -A met I cam that applied down to 
Puidue? 

In Ihe big ball of wax, it really 
doein'l mailer whether we cover lome- 
thJng or nol became Ihe whiles on Ihii 
enmpun coniidercd black foiki to be 
"inviiiblt" 

Now, I know if you're while, you are 
going lo he pined about Ihii last state- 
ment. Dut think about how many limes 
you have sold, "1 don't sec ony color," or 
my favorite. "I'm colorblind." When 
while people lay thai, they arc tending a 
direct message lo us that you do nol see 
ui, became you do nol ice our color; 
therefore we must be invisible. 

Decausc or the position I have pul 
myself in on campus, I have chosen lo 
define my own being and who! you sec, 
hear, and tend is not what you expect or 
want lo confront because I om no one's 
lupemlgga. 

While folki expect most African- 
Americans in power posi lions to be nice, 
polite, and play by their rules leaving 
Ihcir black 1 
administrator c 
that we should nol wear our black con- 
sciousness on our foreheads. Yet, he fails 
to see that he \ 

of Ihe lime by making racist i 
as lhat. For me not to express my own 
feelings is for me lo deny mv blackness, 
my being, and to wear a mask of lies. 
Paul Laurence Dunbar speaks about this 
in one of his poems. He writes: 

We wear the mask lhat grins and lies, 
II hides our checks and shades our eyes, 
This debt we pay lo human guile. With 
lorn and bleeding hearts we smile. And 
mouth with myriad subtlelics. Why 
should Ihc world be over-wise, In count- 
ing all our lean and sighs? Nay, let them 
only lee us, while Wc wear the mask. 

And wc can no longer continue lo 
wear these masks or lies. 

A white student who was outraged 
at my statement, "This country wai 
founded by poor white trash from Europe 
using Ihe genocide of one race and the 
enslavement of another to build it." said, 
"If il wasn't for us you wouldn't be 
here." 

Of course, Ihul outraged Ihc African- 
American students that were there and I 
think that's valid. Bui, I have 10 olio 
acknowledge lhat he was idling the truth. 
If il wasn't for Ihe while man, I would 
nol be here. Dut, 1 think you have lo 
look at several things. 

First of all, I made that powerful 
statement because those boys were hid- 
ing behind Ihe (rue issue which is their 
own racism. Yet, they wanted to hide 
behind everyone else's concerns and not 
make their own problems known. Il il 
this cowardice lhat I had lo address. 
Once I did, the demons that lie within 
their persons expressed themselves by 
Ihe while boys getting up ond leaving. 

Of course, some white people have 
never been able lo explain themselves or 
Ihcir problems with people of color with- 
out covering themselves with a hood 
because il allows the "nigger" within 
themselves lo come out. 

When I use the word nigger in this 
phrase, I am talking about Ihc way lames 
Baldwin uicd the word in his book, "The 
fire Next Time." In Andrew Hacker's 
book, "Two Nations'" he slates: 

lomei Baldwin, in The Fire Next 
Time, saw thai the word served a further 
purpose. While people '"need Ihc nigger," 
he wrote, because il is the "nigger" with- 
in themselves Ihey cannot tolaatc- 

Hacker goes on to suggest that while 
people cannul allow thai niggemess" to 
be a part of their being, because lo do so 
would be 10 accept the fact lhat this con- 
cept of being lazy or hasing stupidity lies 
within their own beings. 

Now, back to the while boy's state- 
ment aboul "If it wasn't for Ihc white 
man, I (as a black man) wouldn't be here. 
" Well, there are several situations where 
if it weren't for the white man, things 
would be different. 

For insiance. if it weren't for Ihe 
white man, Nalivc Americans would not 
be on reservations. 

If it weren't for while men, African- 
Americans would not continue to suffer 
from Ihe institution of slavery. 

If it wcten'l for white men, six mil- 
lion Jews would not have died in the 
Holocaust. Oh, but I forgot lhat was 
while folk against while folk. That was 
different, right? I don't think so. 

If it weren't for good white folk. 
Hitler would not have been slopped. 

If it weren't for good white folk and a 
tot of del arm i nation on Ihe behalf of 
African- Americans, black folk would 
still be in chains. 

Bui 1 am here so instead of trying to 
ignore me or trying lo paint me invisible, 
why not acknowledge the fact thai, 
according to Eillison. "1 am 1 man of 
substance, of tlesh and bone, fiber and 
liquids- and I might even be .-aid to pos- 
sess a mind. I am invisible, understand, 
simply because people refuse to see me."
