Living life without a fear of dying 



He had two T-cells left - so 
few that his physician told him he 
should name them. 

So he did. 

"Frick and Frack," Scotty 
Jones smiles now, thinking back to 
a time when his life was held in the 
balance of those two T-cells. 

Few consider T-cell counts 
when it comes to a medical check 
up. Healthy individuals have 
between 1,500 and 2,000. 

Jones had two. It was a part of 
his life with AIDS - a life that 
found him on the edge of death in 
a prison out west during one of his 
more self-destructive time periods. 

Somehow his body fought 
back. Frick and Frack were slowly 
joined by other T-cells, and Jones 
has been able to rebuild a life that 
was on the verge of death. He's 
doing something more than many 
others do as they go through the 
daily drudgery of life. 

He's living. And trying to 
make a difference. 

He's a second semester fresh- 
man at IPFW studying Human 



O.A.R. 

concert 

Saturday 



Services courses he hopes will 
eventually lead him into a role as a 
reknown caseworker for HIV- 
mli.'i.ifd people. 

His goals are high, and he 
doesn't worry about those at all. 

Right now, he's working on 
organizing the Sept. 12 AIDS Walk 
staled to take place at Lawton Park 
next to Science Central. He knows 
more than most what benefits the 
monies raised do — he's been a 
recipent of it. 

Because of that knowledge, 
he's encouraging others to get 
involved. 

"Whoever raises the most 
funds for their team to donate to 
the AIDS Walk, we'll have an 
awards dinner and certificants of 
recognition," Jones said. 

Jones was infected with HIV 
about 17 years ago and has lived 
with AIDS for over a dozen years. 
He's lived a variety of lives already, 
from a multiple-felon (he's served 
time in prison in California and 
Nevada for property crimes) to a 
methamphetiamin addict (he 
remembers staying awake for days 
on-end with the drug, suffering 
from daymares and other associat- 



ed paranoias) to Hollywood star - 
kind of. 

"I was on an episode of the X- 
Files.' I was an FBI agent. You 
could see the back of my head at a 
terminal," he recalls. 

Yes, he appeared as an extra in 
over approximately 300 television 
shows and three major motion pic- 
tures, he said. For a while, he was 
also addicted to being in the audi- 
ence for Divorce Court, Judge Joe 
Brown and other similar judicial- 
TV. 

He was raised in Muncie and 
ran away at 14. He turned to pros- 
titution after ending up in 
California - doing it sometimes for 
emotional support, and other times 
for financial. It wasn't until he met 
a partner in the mid-1980s that he 
started to grow up, he says, 
explaining the prostitution kept 
him immature about life. 

That partner taught him about 
how. to act as a member of a com- 
munity and of society. 

When his partner died in 1987, 
Jones' behavior nosedived into 
sell-destruction. That's when the 
majority of bis legal trouble began, 
and then the HIV.

April 13 to be a 
silent night at IPFW 



Two hours of silence 
include just as much 
tion as any^fher two hours - with 

.i lew differing challenges for those 

The night, "It's A Deaf, Deaf, 
Deaf, Deaf World," will turn the 
tables on the hearing as they spend 
a few hours trying to negotiate 
their way through simulated gro- 
cery store lines, a doctor's office 
and other situations without say- 
ing a word. 

"We do it so people can basi- 
cally take a look into deaf culture 
and what it feels like in everyday 
life," Hope Hart said. She is the 
president of ASL PAH, the IPFW 
American Sign Language organi- 

There will be about eight sta- 
tions set up for the night, she said. 
It is a way of showing the frustra- 
tions and challenges the deaf com- 
munity face daily. Hart added. 

"Basically, it's to show what it 
feels like to not be able to have 
that," she said. 

During the evening, people 
running the different stations -- all 
of whom are deaf — will be keeping 
a points system on the people who 
stop by. At the end of the evening, 
a tally will be taken to see how 
everyone faired and some prizes 
will be awarded Points will be col- 



lected by successful 
tion with the stations through any 
means aside from voice, according 
to the organization. 

"You can use gestures, or you 
can write," Hart said. 

It takes place Tuesday, April 
13 from 7 to 9 p.m. in the Walb 
Union Ballroom. 

This is the sixth annual night 
of "It's A Deaf, Deaf, Deaf, Deaf 
World" - and despite the inherent 
difficulties of the lack of communi- 
cation, it is a night many people are 
looking forward to. 

"I've heard it's always a good 
experience for people." 

This is the most important 
night showcasing the deaf commu- 
nity of the school year for ASL 
PAH. 

"This is our big event," she 
said. At the end of the night, a 
speaker is slated to talk with par- 
ticipants. 

They also have social gather- 
ings every fourth Monday of the 
month at Glenbrook Mall. 

A night of "It's A Deaf, Deaf, 
Deaf, Deaf World" is welcomed by 
the deaf community, Hart 
explained. 

"They really like this because 
this is what they feel like everyday. 
It gives us a glimpse into their 
lives," Hart said.

Communicator 
staff wins five 
awards at ICPA 



Three former and two current 
ent journalists with The 
municator were recognized 
rday with awards from the 
ana Collegiate Press 



Former Arts &amp; Entertainment 
Editor Andrew Welfle won a First 
Place Award for his story "'To Kill 
A Muckingbird' Adds Originalih "; 
former Photo Editor Eugene 
Harding won First Place for his 
photo illustration "The Haunting 
Truth"; and former Sports Editor 
Nick Airman won First Place for 
Best Editorial Cartoon for his 
sketching of "A Recent Saddam 
Look-Alike Meeting." 

Harding and Airman's illus- 
trations are shown below. 
Harding's digital image was part 
of a story discussing ghost hunters 
working at IPFW published Oct. 
29, 2003. 

"An unusual and well-execut- 
ed digital illustration," a judge cri- 
tiqued Harding's work. 

Airman's cartoon, published a 
year ago in the opening weeks of 
the Iraqi war, discusses an unfortu- 
nate fate for Saddam Hussein - 
and in turn his many look-alikes. 

"The cartoon is well-drawn 
and conveys its serious point 
through humor," a judge said of 
Altman's work. 

Welfle was recognized by 
lodges for his honesty.

"The writer tried something 
daring and pulled it off: Admitting 
his ignorance and using it as a 
springboard to a thoughtful, 
engrossing critique of the play and 
performance. It probably connect- 
ed with lots of other undergradu- 
ates living with the secret shame of 
never having read one of the most 
important novels of the 20th 
Century." 

Two current members of The 
Communicator won Third Place fin- 
ishes. Editor Scott Lawson won an 
award for Best Breaking News 
Reporting fur a story titled "West

and asked if he had the syndrome. 

'"Yes/ he said. And I said, 
'Why didn't you tell me?' And he 
just looked at me and said. You 
didn't ask,'" Jones recalls. 

Not long after that, Jones was 
diagnoised with HIV, and a few 
years later it downturned into 
AIDS. 

He doesn't make any secret of 
his status. He announces it when- 
ever he feels he needs to. 

Jones has been featured by 
NBC 33 on a segment they did 
titled "Living With HIV." Living 
with AIDS hasn't given him any 
breaks — along with his days of 
two T-cells, he survived two bouts 
with cancer since his diagnosis. 

Eventually, he thinks, every- 
one will be affected by HIV. 

"You may not know some- 
body now, but statistics are on the 
rise and are showing that soon we 
will all be aware of somebody in 
our lives that is infected or affected 
by HIV or AIDS in one way or 
another," Jones noted. 

"You may not know anybody 
now, but tomorrow you may get 
that call 'I tested positive. You 
should go get tested,'" he added. 

For him, it was a matter of 
good friends helping turn his life 
around from addictions to helping. 

"I changed my attitude. Here 
I am, 'There but for the grace of 
God go I.' I am now a productive 
member of my community," he 



While he hopes God will 
some day bless him with taking 
the AIDS away, he doesn't pay it 
too much mind. 

"I'm not going to mope. I'm 
going to continue to move for- 
ward. My values have been refo- 
cused," he said. 



Another Night at the Apollo 



"A Night At The 
Apollo 2" was held at 
Neff Hall Saturday. 

Sponsored by Black 
Collegian Caucus, the 
evening featured a vari- 
ety of entertainers — 
ranging from dancers to 
rap groups to soulful 
singers. 

The two hour show 
was hosted by officers of 
BCC and included a few 
entertainment packages. 
Winning the top prize 
of the evening was 
dancer "The 

Unstoppable C.B."-- also 
known as Fort Wayne 
resident Brandon 

Murdock. Tl 




up was the rap group 
"Trendsetters." Murdock (near right) was one of about 
a dozen competitors during the evening. IPFW student 
Tyela Wilson also competited with two duets (far 
right). Above, evening host Terry Collins jokes with a 
cohost and the opening number ~ a trio of kids danc- 
ing. 

The BCC will next host the 2004 Gospel Fest 
Explosion, scheduled to take place April 25 at 6 p.m. in 
the Walb Student Union. Tickets are on sale now for 
the evening, ranging in cost from $5 for IPFW students 
to $8 in advance for general audiences or $10 the night 
of the performance. Any questions can be addressed to 
Terrece Jordan at 402-0706.

Word of the Week: 
Regret 



:ator 



There are times in life when you just need to learn to let things go. 

TTiere are times in life when healing the dead horse no longer makes any sense. 

Soon I will be leaving Indiana to go start a life in Oregon. The only thing I will 
leave behind is the memory of mvselt in the heart? and minds of the people I knew. 
Some of them will remember me fondly; some of them will not. I am deeply regret- 
ful for any actions of my own that caused unhappiness or anger in those few peo- 
ple whom I came to know in my short time here at IPFW. I often think back on those 
1 am leaving behind - especially those I have hurt - and wonder if there is some- 
thing 1 could do to mend these burnt bridges before I go, some magical string of 
words that would make right all of the wrongs I have done. Hopefully I will find 
the words I th.x i c\ and have the strength In say them before I leave. 

Sadly, I think 1 never would have made this attempt to make amends had I decid- 
ed not to move to Oregon. The idea that I will never again have the chance to tell 
these people how much I loved them is my main motivation. What I never realized 
before was that as each day g"es b\, so does another missed opportunity to express 
these most intimate ot feelings - what could perhaps be the last opportunity to do 
so. You never know when someone i\ ill unexpectedly leave, a reality that was made 
clear to me when a coworker suddenly lost a beloved family member in a car acci- 
dent. This world is unpredictable and on sate, and despite our best efforts to protect 
ourselves, we are still vulnerable. Taking someone for granted is the easiest way to 
be hurt terribly. 

I have a list of people I want to talk to before I go: my ex-boyfriend, for whom I 
think I will never stop hurting; the friends i have made here at IPFW, who provid- 
ed me with the support and love I so desperately needed; my coworkers here at The 
Communicator, who have seen me at my worst and my best and still want me 
around; and my mother and step-father, who live with my mess and pay all my 
bills. All of these people have meant more than words can say to me, and I hope 
they never forget me. I know I certainly will never forget them. 

I encourage all nl you gentle readers to make a similar list Who means the most 
lo you? Have you told them that lately 1 Do you take someone for granted? Is there 
someone you hurt with whom you desperately wish to reconcile? So often we 
assume thai our friends anil family know how much we need them, and when they 
are gone, we regret lh.it we didn't tell them each and every day how wonderful they 
are. Don't miss another chance - write down the names of all the people you love, 
and then tell them that you love them, regardless of how well they currently like 
you back. Apologize tor any wrongs you have done them, even if you know it will 
do no good; at least thev will know you meant them well. I hope this exercise in 
expression will save both of us from the sorrowful regret of never having told those 
special people how much we cared.

The beginning of spring, 
the end of discipline 



The Communicator Page 5 



We have now thawed from the 
deep freeze of the winter, and the 
first flowers are beginning to 
bloom (I've seen daffodils!) as we 
march boldly into spring. It is a 
gorgeous time of year. I am still 
surprised when I step outside in 
the morning, and I have the unfa- 
miliar realization: it is warm. 

Yet as the weather warms, the 
earth renews, and people put up 
poetry about spring on their doors, 
it seems that the life inside the 
classroom is slowly descending 
into the rancor of the end of the 



What I find amazing about this 
time of year is how all of the things 
we were able to put off earlier in 
the semester now all push to the 
forefront of our minds. I will offer 
myself as an example: Should I 
begin my Folklore term paper (that 
I know nothing about) or my 
English paper (that I also know 
zero about)? Should I finish my 
math assignments (ha ha), or write 
my articles for the paper? Last 
night I sat down and read a play I 






This is quite easily the worst time 
for students, because it is before 
the impossible crunch of finals 
week when one can simply take a 
long drink of apathy and drag him 
or herself to the classroom to take 
the final. 

It is after the time when one 
should have reasonably begun 
their long term assignments such 
as term papers. Yet, we still have 
about a month before the end of the 
semester — that is quite a few week- 
ends that we can lock ourselves in 
the library, and there are still quite 
a few midnights we can meet when 
we look up from our books. In 
short, there is still hope that some- 
thing can be done to salvage our 
grades — we might not know what 
that thing is, but we hold a hope 
that somehow we can come back 
from the brink and pull off a B or 
C — maybe even an A. 



car named Desire and some guy 
named after a state wrote it...I 
don't know. The story was in New 

I think that this time of year is a 
huge breaking point for a great 
number of students. While some 
students are able to waltz through 
this time of year, blessed with 
either easy classes and a genius (or 
extremely depressed) attitude, I 
would say that the majority of stu- 
dents are all in the same boat — and 
it has sprung a leak. 

I have seen more than one of 
my old friends, now finally gradu- 
ated from high school and in their 
first year of college, meet this new 
level of intensity head-on. I think it 
is interesting to see how they adapt 
to this new level of pressure — 
unlike our times in high school, 
these grades really count, and 
thankfully, most of them are taking 



my friends, but strangers in the 
library, people in the computer lab, 
even just students walking through 
the campus who are struggling, 
really struggling to make it to the 
end of the semester. I know that I 
find myself in the second category 
much more than I ever find myself 
in the first — after all, my first 
degree is in procrastination. 

So here we are, you are sitting 
here reading this paper; you might 
be at lunch, or waiting for your 
next class, or perhaps you are sim- 
ply perusing it before you line your 



sit on the brink of a great decision. 
Until the end of the semester, you 
have two options: sink or swim. 

There is no reason for you to lis- 
ten to me, and I probably should 
have said that at the beginning of 
the column. But I can't help but 
want to share the greatest piece of 
information I have learned about 
this semester: they can only make 
this last until early May. I don't 
know, maybe if we head into this 
stressful time of year with the 
belief that we can do all of this, we 
can finish our term papers and 
pass the tests — we might just sur- 
prise ourselves. 1 think that is bet- 
ter than setting ourselves up for 
failure by saying: "I can't do this, I 
will never finish this project." If it 
is a foregone conclusion anyway, 
why not make it a positive one? 

And on May 8... well, I leave 
you to plan the celebrations. 



Constructive criticism: 

We can dish it out, but we can't take it 



I was visiting a message board 
the other day (I know, I'm a 
geek...so what) and one of the reg- 
ular posters happens to be a 
Canadian gentleman with very 
public opinions. We were dis- 
cussing a website that tells you in 
wha t wea I th level, percentage 
wise, you ranked in comparison to 
the rest of the world. One of the 
other posters commented that if 
she was in the top eight percentage 
of the wealthiest people in the 
world, how come she didn't feel so 
rich? 

"Because you're a spoiled, 
unappreciative American. And I 
don't say this to be funny, but 
because it's the truth, " replied the 
Canadian. 

As you may imagine, the con- 
troversy sparked by this one com- 
ment heated up the boards for 
weeks. Although I tried to stay out 
of it, it was very hard to stay quiet 
for too long. 

I laughed to myself when I 
read the posts of the die-hard patri- 
ots who would defend their coun- 
try to the end without question. 
Their blind faith in what they 
believed was both inspiring and 
discouraging. As a country, we 
need people like that, people that 
will defend what they've been 
taught without questioning the 

I was intrigued by the people 
who attacked him personally. A 
slight deviation from the first peo- 
ple I mentioned, but they went for 
him personally and his country. 
Instead of defending, these offen- 
sive players struck out against tiny- 
thing they could relating to him. 
Canada, his morals, his beliefs, and 
him personally were all subject to 
attack by these posters. 

Still there were those who 
agreed with him. They admitted 
that the United States is far from a 
perfect nation. There are many 
things we take for granted, and are 
there many ways in which we 
could learn something from the 
other nations of the world. 

I am a member of the third 
group. 

Let me start oil by saying that I 
love my country. My father and a 
significant number of my friends 
have all served (or are serving) this 



country through the different 
armed forces. I think we've done a 
lot as a nation; and we have a lot to 
be proud of. But let's face it, we're 
far from perfect. 

I had the opportunity to live in 
Germany in the summer of 2000 
through a cultural and language 
immersion program. I wasn't 
allowed to speak English and I 
lived with a host family for almost 
two months in a city called Krefeld 
(northwest Germany). As they 
say, "when in Rome, do as the 
Romans do," and I quickly picked 
up on the subtle, and not-so-subtle, 
cultural differences between 
Americans and Germans. 

I had many different experi- 
ences while in Germany, and one 
will always stick out in my mind. 
I had only been over there a little 
while, and my host sister Sabrina 
and I were talking. She was 
explaining to me that you can pick 
out the American walking down 
the street before they ever opened 
their mouth. I, of course, didn't 
believe her so we decided to do a 
little experiment. We exchanged 
clothes and she dressed up in the 
"American garb" while I was 
decked out, head to toe, as your 
typical German girl. We headed 



and the girl behind the counter 
asked (in German) what she'd like 
to have. Sabrina ordered and paid, 
and it was my turn. I walked up to 
the counter and smiled. 

"What can I get for you 
today?" asked the girl in forced 
English. 

Taken aback, I answered her in 
German, in hopes that I would con- 
vey a sense of belonging. She 
replied back, "That will be two 
mark two-two" (DM 2.22). We 
gathered our food and we were sit- 
ting outside at the cafe style seating 
and I couldn't stand it any longer. I 
asked Sabrina how she knew, and 
she replied that it is written in 
e\er\ thing we do. 

We take up more room when we 



lompelihon ivith us, whether it be 
speed-walking or getting through 
the doorway first. When we carry 
things, we don't keep them close to 
our bodies, but let them swing free 
and wide. We talk louder and 
more obnoxiously than other peo- 
ple and the concept of considera- 



tion is a foreign one to a lot of us. 

We tend to believe that the 
world owes us a giant favor, and 
we feel slighted if we don't get 
what we feel we deserve. 
However, I tend to believe that we 
get exactly what we deserve in 
some ways. Now, before you 
jump to conclusions, I don't think 
we (or anyone else) deserves such 
blatant acts of terroristic violence; 
9/11 was a tragedy as are the 
recent bombings around the world. 
I think loss of life in any aspect is a 
tragedy, and I don't think that any- 
one deserves that type of an igno- 
rant attack. However, I do think 
we deserve criticism. 

Criticism is how you grow, 
how you make yourselves better. 
In our English classes, we have 
peer-review groups where we 
receive criticism and correct prob- 
lems in our papers. When you 
write letters to the editor express- 
ing your problems, your criticism 
helps us make a better paper for 
you. People are critiqued on what 
they wear, how they decorate their 
houses, what type of people they 
date, and what they do with their 
lives, and this is all OK. But the 
moment someone critiques our 
country, the accusers become igno- 
rant and wrong. 

You can call me a bad parent, 
and you can call me a bad dresser, 
but you better not tell me that my 
country has a problem. 

That is one of the most igno- 
rant things that we as a country do. 
We critique other countries, both 
orally and physically (for example, 
starting war with a country, invad- 
ing them, taking them over, and 
making it exactly as we want it) but 



the i 






tiling critical of 
tend to take our collective fingers 
and put them in our collective ears 
and sing "LA LA LA LA LA LA LA 
I can't hear you." I love my coun- 
try, and I am glad that I am an 
American, but there are still times 
when I wish we'd take our heads 
out of our hind-ends and realize 
that we aren't perfect. 

We need to accept criticism and 
examine ourselves for things we've 
possibly done wrong (or are doing 
wrong] instead of just attacking 
whomever or wherever the criti- 
cism is coming from. 

Remember, the Romans 
thought they were perfect too. 



'Thinking Different' 
makes the world turn 



The Communicalo) 



A few days ago at work, my 

manger and I got onto the subject 
of discussing chaos theories and 
properties of astrophysics. He 
being a good person to talk to 
about educated things, I eagerly 
prodded at his views on said sub- 
jects. As the discussion progressed, 
we jumped topics slightly and got 
onto the idea of where those ideas 
came from. He made the statement 
that the great things we have today 
like the automobile and the air- 
plane came from the minds of 
those considered to be insane. 
Simply put, he said: 

"Those who deserve recognition &lt;nc 
those who were no! afraid )o do what 
other- wouldn't. Those people look Hie 
criticism and persevered through 
despite the obstacles. Even/one else 
wlio followed in and created the fund 
product did just that, followed. Be the 
person who conies up with the strange 
and creates the weird stuff Pursue the 
obscure ideas and eccentric wm/s while 
ignoring those around you." 

When I heard that, I dwelled on it 
for many hours afterwards. Now 
in the midst of my final semester as 
a freshman, it comes back to me, I 
ponder what he was trying to say, 
the point he was driving home. It's 
just like Socrates and Freud. They 
were considered to be crazy for 
their radical ideas and their bold 
declarations, now they are praised 
for the same things that ostracized 
them in their time. Is thinking 
opposite the norm a wrong in our 
iety? 



opposed to cursing it. Prnhracing 
the fact that you might see things a 
bit more skewed than others. 
Myself, when I hear about a plane 
crash on the other side of the 
world, I have the tendency to pon- 
der how many collected frequent 
flyer miles all the passengers had. 
Or if the age-old idea ol the glass 
being half empty or half full is 
counteracted by the idea of the 
glass being TOO big? See, skewed 
thoughts Now, does that make me 
unique or does it make me a crack- 
pot? Anyone? 

One thing 1 have been criticized 
all my life for is my eccentric ways 
Taking a looser look at life and the 
things in it. People have called me 
crazy for my endless pursuit of 
thrills, people have called me 
insane for my radical views on reli- 
gion, school, life, 
relationships... etc. Simply put, 
thinking outside of the proverbial 
"box" is hard nowadays. To get 
away with saying that we evolved 
is the same as driving on the side- 
walk while dangling a baby out the 
window and giving the finger to a 
Nun. You will be called crazy. But 
is it crazy to think different? Is it 
insane to express a radical vision to 
the world? 

Never underestimate radical 
visions; it's an idea that is very use- 
ful to a college student. These are 
the time that we come up with 
some of the craziest thesis and 
papers of our lives. That is what I 



think a real scientist or doctor is, 
someone who thinks outside of 

their given profession. A real M.D. 
to me is someone who not only 
diagnosises you with cancer but 
works tirelessly to find a cure for it, 
and when he does, even if he is 
long dead he is still given the cred- 
it They come up with the crazy 
idea to somehow utilize duct tape, 
six knitting needles and a rubber 
duck to make a person walk again. 
That is a doctor ladies and gentle- 
man. Not a person who merely 
was educated by books but some- 
one who actually thinks and does. 
MacGuyver is a prime example of 
this. In his TV career, MacGuyver 
stopped masses of fire ants with a 
quarter and a generator, and he 
flew an airplane with the help of a 
Geiger counter, a broken whiskey 
bottle and his hand Swiss Army 
knife. That is what a scientist is in 
my opinion, someone who creates 
his or her own thing. Not someone 
who is educated and just stops 



their knowledge. Science is about 
predicting and proving, assuming 
that something is true and then try- 
ing to make sure you're right. If it 
doesn't work, you draft a new idea 
and try to do that. Science is the 
epitome of repetitive processes for 
a better life. 

When Steve Jobs, co-founder of 
Apple Computers, made the bold 
statement that by the year 2000 
almost every home in the United 
States would have a computer, 
people laughed. Now in the year 



nuclear reactor called 
a microwave and a wonderfully 
convenient thing called indoor 
plumbing. All of these were radical 
ideas that were first scoffed at, then 
pursued tirelessly by the dreamers. 
They proved their ideas and re- 
proved them and then reconfig- 
ured to make it even smaller and 
more cost-effective. The dreamers, 
when you think abput it, are the 
backbones of our society. They 
made it all possible. 

As I wrap this up and float back 
to what my friend told me, I 
remember the first time I saw an 
Apple Computer ad. I was maybe 
about 14 years old and scanning 
the magazine titles at the local 
supermarket and I picked up a 
copy of Time. I began flipping 
through its pages, reading about 
this and that in the world and final- 
ly closed it seeing how the line was 
moving. I flipped it over and on 
the back was a picture of Albert 
Einstein sticking his tongue out at 
the camera. (Ifs a very popular 
poster among college kids appar- 
ently) I looked down at the corner 
of the ad and read the type. "Think 
Different" is what it read. 

The more I connect to what my 
manager was saying, and my own 
influences and happenings incor- 
porate into my existential being,

Rodriguez speaks of 'brown' America 

Continue from Page One 



begins to see the census 
numbers change, "Indiana 
(is) beginning to consider a 
future of complexity" 
regarding the increasing 
Hispanic population, said 
the speaker. 

The speaker related his 
quest to find "Hispanics" 
around the world for his lat- 
est book. However, 
Rodriquez wryly remarked, 
"You have to go to the 
United States to meet one." 

The notion of Hispanics is 
unique to America. He dis- 
agrees with the wording 
because of the world-wide 
variety blanketed by the 
classification. Hispanics "are 
not a race" according to 
Rodriguez, and instead he 
lists the problem of 
"America, obsessed by ... 
blood as an identity" as the 
source of many of the coun- 
try's race problems. 

Rodriguez related 

memories of his childhood 
in California, in the 1950s 
and 60s. 

"America was still a 
black and white country," he 
said. Rodriguez recounted 



he was outside the Civil 
Rights struggle and race 
riots because of his heritage, 
and thus he was unharmed, 
though not accepted by 
either side. 

"The only price I paid 
was my irrelevance," said 
Rodrigu* 



nted a part 



America — a brown 

this conversation," said the 

speaker. 

Rodriguez advocates the 
heritage of culture as a better 
definition of one's heritage. 
In regard to Hispanics, 
"What unifies us is the 
notion (if culture rather than 
blood," he said. The speaker 



nted 



the 



Spanish-speaking 
and the variety of 
peoples who fall under the 
Hispanic classification. 

"My language, my food . 
my music," said the speaker. 

The speaker recounted his 
research for his last book, 
and he "spent seven years 
thinking about the color 
brown." he said. 

"Why do Americans think 
of us as brown?" he asked. 



The speaker used the 
color brown to illustrate 
what he called "the brown- 

"l'm not talking about 
me — I'm talking about us," 
said Rodriguez. The speaker 
explained that the mixing of 
colors — the brown — is the 
future of America. 

Rodriguez compared the 
"sexless" American history 
with the story of "Mexico — 
an exotic story of rape by 
Spain," said the speaker. 

Rodriguez recounted the 
ability for the people of 
Mexico to accept the cultural 
bleedings that have histori- 
cally taken place in Mexico. 
"All things melt in 
Mexico," said the speaker, 
though "Mexico is not a 
country I dream about," he 
amended, "I do not suffer the 
illusion that 1 would be on 
TV in Mexico. ... Mexico is 
without that amazing pro- 
noun ... the I," he said. 

Rodriguez contrasted 
the cultural blending of 
Mexico with the necessity 
for America to categorize its 
citizens into discrete cate-

invented Hispanics," said 
the speaker, through his five- 
category svstem of race iden- 
tification commonly seen on 
applications. 

This identification sys- 
tem "established Hispanics 
as an adversary of Blacks," 
Rodriguez said. He called 
the idea of numerical ascen- 
dancy that is "replacing 
African-Americans" as "ludi- 

"It is obscene to say that 
I replace you," said 
Rodriguez, speaking to 



addre 

"Whiteness" in America. 

"Most white people in 
America are not," said the 

"It is too much to pay, 
this business of being white 
in America," said Rodriguez. 
The speaker commented on 
the supposed lack of culture 
in White America, and asked 
the audience "What do you 
mean you have no culture?" 

The speaker also spoke 



on the topic of the post 9/11 
world, and how "after Sept. 
11, (people were) beginning 
to wonder about the danger 
of brown," said the speaker. 
Rodriguez used the example 
of Osama Bin Laden as a per- 
son who "wants people 
exactly like himself." 

"Connect the dots," said 
Rodriguez. 

Rodriguez also 

addressed the topic of diver- 
sity, and reminded the audi- 
ence that "diversity etymo- 
logically comes from the 
word divide," he said. 

"Multiculturalism is 
honorable and human ... (it) 
establishes the sacredness of 
I," said Rodriguez. However 
while "it is very honorable . . . 
it is very cold - nothing 
melts," he added, 

The "value of American 
individualism is a commu- 
nal value," Rodriguez said.

Drummer Chulos of OAR. 
ready to rock Fort Wayne 



When it comes to being 
interviewed, Chris Cuios 
knows exactly what to say. 
Afier being asked where his 
favorite place to play live is, 
Culos responded without 
pause, "Fort Wayne, 
Indiana!" 

Whether that's the 
truth, or if he responds with 
their city to every reporter 
who asks that question, is 
beyond the point. After a 
long drought of Fort Wayne- 
worthy bands, any enthusi- 
asm, feigned or for real, is 
welcome. 

Culos is the drummer 
of the "island vibe, roots 
ruck" band Of A Revolution, 
or O.A.R for short. Along 
with lead singer /guitarist 
Marc Roberge, Culos found- 
ed the band during their 
days at Ohio University in 
Columbus, Ohio. By the time 
graduation rolled around in 
2001, O.A.R was preparing 
to embark on a nationwide 

It was on those early 

tours that their cult-like fan 
base spread the word, most- 
ly by way of file-sharing pro- 
grams such as Napster. 

Culos, who is aware of 
the benefits Napster has 
awarded them, says that

and swapping shows with 
friends, but it's when you 
make money off those 
recordings it's a problem." 

Lead singer Roberge 
also gives credit to online- 
swapping. 

"1 know that pisses off 
half the record industry, but 
it's the truth," he said. "You 
can't really deny it. It's the 

play at every college in trie 
country." 

Up until less than a year 
ago, O.A.R was under their

"Everything is so perfectly 
timed. They pre-record it, 
but it is recorded live, right 
down to commercial breaks 
and how long we have to 
play our song." 

As with many jam band 
rockers, there are a few song 
staples that are favorites 
among their college fan base. 

"Crazy Game of Poker," 
which was first released on 
their debut, "The Wanderer," 
is no doubt a song to rock to. 



don't feel like they're becom- 
ing redundant. 

"We play that song 
often because we realize 
where that song has taken 
us," he said. "We really do 
enjoy playing it, mostly 
because of the different ways 
we find to jam to it. It's the 
songs we don't play very 
often that we find difficult 

O.A.R, although known 
for their original runes, are 
also known for their covers. 
Culos confessed that a few of 
the covers discussed for this 
upcoming tour are "Sunday 
Bloody Sunday" by U2 and a 
few Bob Marley tunes. 

O.A.R recently record- 
ed a cover of Led Zeppelin's 
"Fool in the Rain" with lap 
steel rockers Robert 
Randolph and the Family 
Band. Culos, who himself is 
a huge Zeppelin fan, says 
that they didn't attempt to 
mimick the Zeppelin sound. 

"We knew that we 
couldn't even come close to 
Zeppelin, so we didn't try to. 
Instead we brought our own 
sound to it and just had a 
good time." 

O.A.R. is playing live at 



Student Activities Board 
eventi And we know Culos 
is looking forward to it. Fort 
Wayne is his favorite place to 
play live, at least that's what 
he says this week.

'Anti-concert' a great show 



Friday night's Fort

"Unplugged Unplugged"

The conductor was leading 
the orchestra wearing jeans 
and a purple, white and 
black windbreaker. Among 
the musicians, flowered 
shirts, sneakers, jeans, and 
corduroys v. 
dress. This 
Philharmonic Unplugged, 
celebrating eight years of, to 
quote announcer Melissa 
Long, "the anti-concert." 

Conductor Edvard 
Tchivzhel, opened with a 
crashing performance of 
Mussorgsky's "The Great 
Gates of Kiev" from Pictures 
at an Exhibition. It was well 
received by the near-capaci- 
ty crowd at the PAC. 

The next piece was 
Rossini's "William Tell: 
Overture." This was excel- 
lently performed, with a 
beautifully executed cello 
solo opening the piece. 
Smooth orchestral entrances 
painted the piece's depiction 
of a thunderstorm, with 
crashing drums of thunder 
and clamorous brass bolts of 
lightning. Calm wind solo 
interludes were reminiscent 
of Bugs Bunny cartoons, 
when the coyote tries to steal 
sheep from placid fields. The

though he was charging for- 
ward on the Lone Ranger's 
horse while musicians 
perched on the edges of their 
chairs. The piece ended to an 
enthusiastic response, with 
many cheers of approval. It 
was perhaps the best done 
piece on the program. 

The next piece ("Finale" 
from Mendelssohn's 

"Symphony No. 4 in A 
major" op. 90) was inspired 
after Mendelssohn had been 
in Italy. Basically a tarantella, 
this piece opened quickly, 
the flutes whirled through, 
and orchestra took over. The 
volume was somewhat 
muted, but the dynamics 

After this piece. Long 
introduced Greg Stieber, 
who gave a brief history and 
introduced a video that cap- 
tured the orchestra's inter- 
pretation of Unplugged con- 
certs. Said feelings were that 
Unplugged concerts are dif- 
ferent from the norm 
because musicians don't 
have to wear formal attire 
and are there for the music, 
not the aura of classicism. 

The next , piece, 
Beethoven's "Fifth" (Op. 67), 



after Conductor Tchivzhel 
entered the stage on 
rollerblades. He proceeded 
to conduct the rest of the 
concert from rollerblades, 
locking his feet so he didn't 
sail off the podium. Even so, 
his feet would scoot back 
and forth at very energetic 
parts of pieces. Even though 



the conductor was on blades, 
he and the orchestra were 
able to concentrate on their 
music. A slight lack of vol- 
ume from the violins was 
noticeable, as well as the fact 
that a single violin could 
sometimes be heard over the 
others, but overall, the piece 
uvnt quite well. 

Next was Bach's "Air on 
the G String." It was beauti- 
fully done, the harmonies 
performed in such a way 
that caused the listener to 
feel concerned, then relaxed, 
then awed at the tranquility 
inspired by the piece. 

Shostakovich's 
"Allegretto" from 

"Symphony No. 5" was 
begun, parts of the piece 

Other parts of the piece were 
similar to "Peter and the 
Wolf." 

"Porgy and Bess: A 
Symphonic Picture" 

arranged by R.R. Bennett, 
came next. To quote the con- 
ductor, the few tunes played 
were those "most beloved by 
myself." They were well 
done, rather in the manner 



when the percussionist's cap 
gun wouldn't go off. The 
conductor grabbed a spare 
sitting on a music stand and 
snapped off shots at appro- 
priate times. The audience 
loved it. At the finish, the 
percussionist finally got his 
cap gun to work, so the con- 
ductor and musician were 
trading shots in a general 
ruckus. This piece earned the 
conductor an extra bow — 
and a standing ovation. 

The music chosen was 
great. It was exciting, full of 
interesting anecdotes and 
material the audience 
enjoyed hearing. 



Sunday show well done 



Masson Robertson's 
Sunday concert at Neff Hall 
was a first-rate display of 
musical ability. The first half 
of the concert was devoted 
to Beethoven's "Rondo in C 
Major" (Op. 51), "Six 
Ecossaises," and "Andante 
Favori in F Major" and 
Greig's "Suite in the Old 
Style" (Op. 411) The Grieg 
selection, especially, was full 
of lively rhythms and 
melodic styles from a pletho- 
ra of different eras. 

The second half of the 



concert was Poulenc "Suite 
Francaise", Chopin "Grand 
Valse Brillante, A minor, 
Op.34 No.2" and "Waltz, E 
minor", and Bartok 
"Rumanian Dance No.l, 
Op.Sa." The Puolenc had 
musical humor, full of pre- 
dictable melodies inter- 
spersed with jarring disso- 
nances. However, the best 
part of the concert came as 
the encore, which was 
Chopin's "Minute Waltz." 
Robertson's fingers flew 
over the keys to finish the 
piece in a minute. Overall it 
was a well-done perform- 



of 






Hammerstein, complete 
with a celestia or xylophone, 
that added a sparkling air. 

The concert ended on J. 
Strauss's "On the Hunt 
Polka" {Op. 373). During the 
piece, one of the percussion- 
ists played a cap gun. It was 
rather startling, but it added 
authenticity to the aura of 
hunt music. The best part of 
this concert was the encore,

Editing work online 
increasingly popular 



WASHINCTON-fBUSlNESS WIRE via 
COLLEGIATE PRESSWIREJAn undergradu- 
ate thesis or doctoral dissertation is the pin- 
nacle of academic achievement. 

Often hundreds of pages long, such a 
work represents years of scholarship, stress 
and lost sleep. 

It's no wonder that ,is a thesis or disser- 
tation nears completion, many .students have 
little energy to spare for painstaking copy- 
editing and formatting. Increasingly, stu- 
dents are turning to convenient online edito- 
rial support firms to streamline this arduous 
process. 

According to Nancy Gilmore, director 
of Doctoral Student Services at George 
Washington University, profession.]] editing 
services deliver undeniable benefits. 

"These students have enough inning on." 
she explains. "There are a lot of things to 
worn,' about in preparing a 300-page docu- 
ment, and a skilled editorial eye is always .1 
good safeguard against proofreading 

Although some students choose to han- 
dle their own final copyediting and proof- 
reading, Gilmore cautions against it. "I 
always recommend hiring an editing turn 
whenever students ask," she says. 

For time-starved students, an online 
editing service is an ideal solution. Such 
companies often have dozens of available 
editors, including many who specialize in 
technical fields. 

Well-established online editing firms 
also offer professional project manage- 
ment and guarantee their work-perks 
that protect busy students from the has- 
sles and hazards of dealing with inde- 
pendent freelancers. 

Dale Adams, president of Wordfirm 
Inc., considers thesis and dissertation 
work one of his company's greatest 



strengths. "We do a lot 

to alleviate the pressure on dissertation can- 
didates," he explains. "They've put so much 
effort into researching and writing the docu- 
ment... For many, it's a great relief to hand 
off the final polishing and formatting." 

Adams is sensitive to the ethical issues 
involved in editing academic work. 

"Although our firm offers full-fledged 
writing and substantive editing services, for 
theses and dissertations we provide only 
copyediting, proofreading, and formatting," 
he explains. "Ideally, a student will come to 
us with a near-finished document that has 
already received preliminary approval from 
an advisor or dissertation committee." 

Like many clients, John Mark discov- 
ered Wordfirm through a quick Internet 

Mark worked with Word firm on and off 
for nearly two years he describes as "incred- 
1 h 1 v supportive and helpful." 

He points out that in addition to elevat- 
ing the quality of his dissertation. It's sup- 
port also helped him work more efficiently 
through each round of ri 

"Although Vi 
I took my dissertation very seriously," he 
explains. "Thanks in part to Wordfirm, it is a 
masterpiece that 1 am extremely proud of."

Yellow Jackets vs. Huskies: a true

It is rare to find an NCAA

Not every year do the two
