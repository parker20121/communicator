correction system. 



Smith Corona's Correcting 
Cassette means an end to 
twists, tangles and fumbles. 

It's an easy-to-load, drop-in 
correction tape you can insert in 
mere seconds. 

There are no spools to 
unwind. No complicated thread- 
ing. No more muttering under 
your breath. US that simple. 

What'sjust as simple is 
ourRight Ribbon System'." It 
simply prevents you from 
using the wrong combination 
of ribbon and correcting 

You'll find our Correcting 
Cassette and Right Ribbon 
System on the Smith Corona

You'll also find lots of other 



great features on the XL 2500- 
like the Spell-Right'" 50,000
