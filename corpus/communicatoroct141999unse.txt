National Depreiiion 
Screening Day for Ihe pan five 
yeari. 'I think ll's a worthwhile 
event that has great potential to 
help prnple," jald Judy TiUapaugh, 
IPFWWellness/Fltnesi Coordlnaior. 
Participants completed deprej- 
lion Identification lurveyi and sev- 
eral counselors were present to 
conduct the len-mlnute, conllden- 
tlal depreiilon screenings. The 
counselor! included IPFW associate 
faculty members, many of whom 
also have private practices dealing 
with depreulon, mania or abuse. 

Some of the signs and symp- 
toms of clinical depression identi- 
fied by Partaiew Behavioral Health 
Include reduced pleasure or Inter- 
est In all or most dally activities, 
significant weight loss or gain, 
chronic insomnia, pronounced 
fatigue, inability to concentrate, 
feelings of worthlessness or inap- 
propriate guilt, and recurrent 
thoughts of death or actually plan- 



nlng/atlemptlng luldde. 

According to Faw\'er, there U a 
lower rale of clinical depression In 
college students than in people In 
their thirdei and fortlei, although 
the early college years are often 
when the stresson that can cause 
depression arc flnl Identined. 'The 
number one thing to look for In 
college students Is a drop In grades 
and lack of desire to go to class,' 
said Fawver. "Genetics and stress 
play a big role In whether someone 
will become depressed.' Excessive 
stress can cause chemical changes 
In Che brain. Imbalances In these 
chemicals can lead to depression. 

-The Ideal treatment for 
depression Is and -depressive med- 
ication, If needed, and talk therapy, 
whether It be one-on-one, group 
therapy or a support group. 
Exercise Is also a great antl-depru- 
sant,' said Fawver. In addition to 
professional help and exercise, 
Fawver listed socialization and 
involvement In community activi- 
ties as mood elevators. 

"if you are in a position to 
help others, you will be less likely 
to develop depression,' said 
Fawver. "The bottom line Is that 
you have a purpose to get up every 

Those concerned that they or

Interactive CD-Rom part of alcohol awareness 



by Mislianna Wood. 
Managing Editor 



Step into a world of 
sounds, colors, a talking 
lava lamp and a simulated 
college parry scene via the 
Interactive CD-ROM, 
Alcohol 101. Alcohol 101 
was designed, created and 
developed by students and 
professors at the University 
of Illinois at Urbana 
Champaign In partnership 
with the Century Council. 

This CD Is Intended to 
Inform Its users about 
physiological, psychological 
and the legal Issues associ- 
ated with alcohol misuse. 
Ai part of Alcohol 
Awareness Week, which 
runs from Oct. 17 through 
the 23. the university dis- 
tributed 30 free copies of 
the CD to many universldes 
across the nation. 

This CD Is available to 
IPFW students at the 
Helmke Library Service 
desk. It must be checked 
out with Idendllcation. The 
CD can only be used in the 
library lab with head- 
phones. 

Once these Items are 



obtained, a student must 
install the program Into the 
computer before exploring 
the CD. After this has been 
done. Positive Norm, the 
blue and gray lava lamp 
that sports a green hat and 
sunglasses greets the user 
with Jokes. The lamp serves 
as an Informational guide 
through the program. 
Norm Is not afraid to 
express his opinion on alco- 
hol related siluadons. 

The nrst step to com- 
plete before entering the 
parry, as chatroom lingo 
calls It, Is stats. 

It U an analysis of the 
individual, since, according 
to the CD, Ihe effects of 
alcohol vary from person to 
person. The following Infor- 
mation It requested from 
the user name, age (which 
is followed by legal alcohol 
related Information), 
height, weight, gender, 
musical preference, the 
amount of food the user 
eats before a parly, Ihe 
amount of alcoholic bever- 
ages the user consumes on 
a weekly basis, the user's 
estimation of the average 
amount of alcoholic bever- 



ages consumed by college 
students on a weekly basis 
and the type of mood the

lated bar, visit people. 
drive, enter the rave room, 
watcli television, read the 
Reality Wall or try lo 
answer some of Norm's 20 
qucsdons. Each area of the 
party focuses on different 
aspects of alcohol misuse 
and Its consequences. 

While at the bar. one 
can sample drinks such as 
Long Island Ice tea, grain 
punch, malt liquor and 
wine coalers. Each drink Is 
labeled wlik a different 
amount of alcohol per nuld 

mated felood alcohol levels 
change wlih ihe amount of 
time these twverages are 
consumed. SkMatJani arise 
when one visits people at 
the party. Ttie user gets to 
'choose an ajvcniure' and 
make the decision of 
whether or not Ihe people 
on the CD *ttould continue 
with Iheb- acOvltta. If one 



chooses to drive while 
Intoxicated, the user Is 
Informed about several 
consequences that could 
occur If an accident would 
happen. 

These are only a few of 
the Informational devices 
used on thU CD. 

According to Frank 
Borelli, vice chancellor of 
Student AlTalrs. the CD pro- 
vides fun Information. 
Borelli says the CD Ls used 
In the orientation process 
of many large campuses. In 
addition to Alcohol 101, 
many other events will 
accompany Alcohol 

Awareness Week. 

A display, containing 
information about alcohol 
and Alcohol Awareness 
Week will be set up In the 
basement of KetUer on OcL 
18. 

On OcL 20. WMEE will 
be passing out information 

between 7:30 and 9:30 a-m. 
between Keltler and Neff. 
Then, at noon. Parkview 
Hospiiars helicopter will 
land on campus In order to 
inform students about alco- 
hol use.

Letter to the editor 
Guidelines trouble citizen 

I recently read Mlshanna Wood's article about the 
guidelines Issued for handling disruptive students. As a 
former student. I have not read nor plan to read the 
guidelines. 1 only hope that It does not require students to 
sit down, shut up and be chained to chairs as the only 
way professors can teach today's demanding, but non-vlo- 

Thls Is an Issue that Is dear to my heart because of 
my experience with being lalieled a "disruptive student." 
As for my own personal experience, 1 belie\'e I was "cho- 
sen for preferential treatment removal" for )usi breathing 
as an African-American studenL Excuse mol for having 
the nerve to sign up for a certain class, appearing on dme 
and for doing well In the classroom. Some professors can 
only take so much from certain students who participate 
In classroom discussion, especially students who over- 
shadow the professors' preferred students. 

Some may disagree, but 1 belle\'e this labeling can be 
used as an excuse for Intolerance of differences, and not 
to curb violence thai appears in the classroom from stu- 
dents who believe In absolutely challenging stereo t&gt;-pt.'s 
expressed by professors. This venom, spewing from the 
mouths of professors who lack "dlvenity" In their real life 
experiences in a multi-cultural environment. Is more vio- 
lent than any gum-chewing student or late-arriving stu- 
denL (Professors, please, for late arrivals, keep the back 
rows for these students or maybe a reduction In grades 
after so many occurrences, Just don't make It personal. 
Students may have busy lives, especially since many are 
students who work long houn.) 

Again some may not agree, but unless a student is 
straight up belligerent, or acts out like students in the 
Columbine shoodngs. I believe the guideline is to discour- 
age certain groups' participation in the classroom. 1 
believe the guideline is for the protection of professors 
who teach their bias unchallenged. Remember that some 
professors believe that they are Invincible as for removal 
from their "endtlement for lifetime employment" because 
they have tenure. 

Therefore. 1 would question this focus on the other 
students who may not be the nxits to the problem of dis- 
ruptive behavior In the classroom. 1 would encourage, 
howe\er. all students to document, early on, any incident 
with a professor or student that may threaten the right to 
an educadon without prejudice, discrimination or bias 
with the Student AlTalrs Offlce for their protection.

Artistic interpretations 

by Rachel Landrum, Staff Colimmist 

Is a shark preserved in formaldehyde art? 
Apparently over 300,000 people In London thought so. 
That Is the number of people in London who, In 1997, 
came to see the controversial art cthlhlt. "Sensation." 
In ftct. at another showing at the Hamburger BahnhofF 
in Berlin, the exhibit wus extended one extra month In 
order to accommodate those who wanted to view the 
exhibit. Arnold L Lehman, director of the Brooklyn 
Museum of Art, where "Sensailon' Is currently 
on display, said, "From my first visit to this 
extraordinary exhibition In London, it has been a 
goal to make this material available to our audi- 
ences in New York. Reflecting the contemporary 
artistic energy and creativity In Great Britain, 
this exhibition contains important work that pro- 
vokes, challenges and rewards the viewer.' 

The exhibit In question contains pieces from more 
than 40 artists. The an comes from the collection of 
Charles Saatchl. known by some as one of the most 
Important collectors of contemporary art In the world. 

The piece that Is causing the greatest stir ii a 
painting by artist Chris Oflll, entiticd 'The Holy Virgin 
Mary, 1996." It was partially created with elephant 
dung. In Itself, the painting Is just anther depiction of 
Mary. When people caught wind that dung, or feces, 
was on the picture, they went ballistic. There was such 
an outcry that New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani has gone 
so far as to threaten to pull funding from the museum 
and to evict them from tiie building. 

There Is publicity that has assigned a negative 
connotation to this picture. However, there are an Infi- 
nite number of ways to Interpret not only this art, but 
also anything we see. If so many people are offended, 
why did over 9.000 people see the exhibit the day It 
opened? The artist himself sa)!, "The people who are 
attacking this painting are attacking titelr own Inter- 
pretation, not mine.* Maybe the tumout was a result of 
the hype. The public does not need a patriarchal figure 
deciding what we should and should not see. 

The museum Is a public building, but Is not an 
open display for anyone on the street to see. One mull 
walk through the door and make Che choice to view 
this exhibit, [f naked, pedophillc pictures were hanging 
across town, then the public would have a right to 
protest In the Interest of protecting the Innocent, One 
must make the choice to enter the Brooklyn Museum 
and view the arc At this point. It would be Impossible 
for anyone not to know what he or she was walking 
into. 

If we allow this kind of legal censorship, then we 
are also looking the other way while the government 
corrodes the spiritual and creative nature of the peo- 
ple. What kind of world will we live In If legislators sit 
around and pass bills that tell us how to think) 1 want 
my daughter to be able to go to the library and check 
out books of Van Gogh and to experience the wonder 
of staring at a painting for an hour, trying to bterpret 
It. I want her to be tree to choose which exhibit Is 
offensive and which one Is just someone's personal 
expression. 

Perhaps Harry Hllson, contemporary artist, put it 
best. He said, 'Sticks and stones may break my bones, 
but art shall never hurt mc.'

The use of handkerchiefs Is fairly common, or at 
least it was when I was growing up. I still buy my 
father a box of hankies ever&gt;' year for Christmas, how- 
ever, 1 have never splurged for the more expensive silk 
ones. Dear Dad always received the made-to-last-forev- 
er(ughl) cotton ones. 

Of course, now that 1 give it some thought. It's 
really rather Ironic that the trendy businessmen that 
daintily dab their noses with silk or satin hankies are 
really just storing expensive 'dry clean only' Kleenex. 

Handkerchiefs do serve many purposes. What else 
would men use to wipe the sweat from their brows but 
the same square of linen with which they blew their 
noses an hour earlier? One can keep a variety of body 
fluids stored away for safekeeping. An easier alterna- 
tive would be for men to simply do as children do (I 
ask you. Is there really a difference between most men 
and children?) and pause only long enough to drag 
either a sleeve or the bottom of their shirt across their 

s before resuming activity. Although handker- 
chiefs are not as popular with women, perhaps we 
could substitute a fabric hair holder or scarf to lake Its

put her hair back Into a ponytall or re-tie her fashion-

The next time you reach for a handkerchief to 
stuff in your pocket, cram it in your top pocket Instead 
and stick a handful of nice, disposable, single-use only 
tissues in your pants pocket and, If time is on your 
side, make a voyage lo the resiroom. Society will great- 
ly appreciate the gesture.

whyor why not. Their responses can be found in the captions accompanying their pictures. bm.b, ifciwrimnium^E! 



Above; ' I Uiink it 
would be really nice to 
get dorms; they could

a lot more to IPFW

Writer bell hooks questions, critiques 



by EficSauS: 
Features Editor 



bell hookl. bom Clorti Jean Watidiu, li a 
writer who li always ihlnUng critically and 
cxptoring complex iMuei with courage, IntelJl- 
gence and pajilon. Her writing deals with 
Issues of gender, sexuality, class and race In 
ways that constantly question aisumptjons and 
Itcreotyped representations. 

fioofci' theoretical writings are powerful 
because they are InTormEd by a lifetime of 
commitment to social change, hooks' books of 
criticism and comn&gt;entaiy feel like the fruit of 
a life lived. Instead of dry academic posturing. 
hooks strives to make her writing accessible to 
a large popular audience without sacrificing 
the complexity of her Ideas. 

hooks addresses Issues that affect every- 
one by weaving personal experience, social 
commentar&gt;', literar&gt;' and an criticism, as well 
as Insights Into popular culture. Not only are 
hooks' wiitin%i Insightful, they arc wriiten In a 
it&gt;'ic that combines serious academic discourse 
with conversational clarity, 

I'm sure that all new readen of her works 
will come away with their Ideas about the 
world challenged, If not changed. In a time 
when Ideas about gender, r^ce and class are 
slmpllHed and distorted by most mainstream 
media, bell hooks Is a refreshing voice that 
calls for critical thinking and dialogue. 

hooks Is not afraid to speak her mind. She 
ne\'er pretends to be neutral or "objective." If 
she Is overwhelmed with despair, Joy or anger, 
she lets the reader know, hooks Is not afraid to 
dissent when her opinions are unpopular. 

Many of the positions she has taken on 
key issues have estranged her from trtendi, 
family, colleagues and various communities. 
She has made a commitment to honest Investi- 
gation, regardless of personal consequences. 

What makes her writing so engaging Is her 
openness lo reconsider and reevaluate her own 
Ideas, hooks does not set herself up as an 
authoriij' figure with all the answers. Instead, 
she models a kind of social Interaction where 
honest and thoughtful dialogue replaces domi- 
nance and hierarchy. 

In many o( her essays and interviews, 
hooks criticizes those who work against racism, 
while still adhering to se-tlsm and class elitism. 
Likewise, she critiques those Involved with 
feminist or class struggles who Ignore Issues of 
race. She doesn't address these Issues by wag- 
ging a Judgmental finger she Is merely point- 
ing out these Inconsistencies as a way to make 
people aware that we are all responsible for 
making the world a more humane and just 



Throughout her essays, she talks about 
ways In which people can 'divest' from atti- 
tudes and Institutions that reinforce oppres- 
sion, hooks Is refreshing because she realizes 
the difficult, conflicting social realities we all 
must leam to negotiate. 

hooks often criticizes Interviewers and 
other authors who take her suiemcnu and 
writings out of context. Because her writing is 
so thoroughly and passionately engaged with 
her subject maner, sound bite excerpts do not 
effectively capture the spirit of her work. A 
svriter and thinker of such Ingenuity cannot be 
easily encapsulated into blurbs. 

Instead of selecting an Individual book to 
review, I chose to suggest some places on the 
web that contain various excerpts, interviews 
and reviews of her writing. There Is no such 
thing as a "representative" piece of bell books' 
writing. She Is an extraordinarily prolific writer 
who addresses an immense range of topics In a 
variet&gt;- of ii&gt;ies. I hope that by giving some 
links to a range of bell hooks articles, people 
can aake up their own minds about her work.
