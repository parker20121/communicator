IPFW sludents may think Follet's 
bookstore is just another bookstore, but 
it has more to offer than jusl text books. 
Follett's offers a wide variety of goods 
from aspirin and beer mugs to greeting 
cards and current novels. 

Follett's main sales are textbooks, 
according to manager Paul Little. The 
instructors select the text, the publisher 
sets the price, and Follett's supplies the 
text. 

Full text book refunds will be given 
until Jan. 31. Books must be ac- 
companied- by the cash register receipt, 
and must be in new condition. 

Used books may also be returned and 
students will be given half price if the 
book is currently being used that 
semester. The remaining books will be 
priced from a whole sale price list. 

Follett's has served IPFW since July 
of 1969. The bookstore is a privately run 
company with 65 stores nationwide. A 
percentage of Follett's income goes to 
the university for leasing space. 

When text books are misplaced. 
Little suggests that you notify Follett's 
because they keep a list of stolen books 
at the cash register. When any used 
books are returned for refund the 
person must sign a paper confirming 
those are their books. According to 
Little many lost and stolen books have 
been recovered this way. 

Follett's is open Monday-Thursday 9 
a.m. -8p.m., Friday 9a.m, -5 p.m., and 
Saturday 10 a.m. -1p.m. i 



Registration begins 



By SYLVIA ORTIZ 
Staff Writer 

IPFW classes have already begun 
and for the mosl part registration is 
ending, but for the Office of Continuing 
Education class registration is only 
now beginning. 

Although most classes are not 
scheduled to begin until the first of 
February, persons interested in signing 
up for a special class are encouraged to 
register at least one week prior to the 
start of the class to ensure their 
enrollment. 

"Since the classes we offer are 
generally small, they usually fill up 
fairly quickly," explained Michael W. 
Hinkle, operations assistant for the 
Office of Continuing Education. "In 
fact a few of our more popular classes 
are already full, like photography and 
floralarranging." 

Designed to provide the community 
with opportunities to learn things not 
otherwise offered in regular college 
programs, the Continuing Education 
program has turned out to be a very 
successful venture. 

Noting that last year's enrollment in 
Ihe Continuing Education program was 
11,500 students, Hinkle said that these 
courses seemed to be supplying the 
demand for different types of courses 
wanted by the community. 



"Enrichment." Our program here 
offers people a means of enriching their 
lives in whatever area they may feel 
they wish to improve or else they want 
to learn more about a specific area 
simply to enrich their lives," Hinkle 
commented. 

For the spring session, about 28 new 
classes have been added to the course 
offering booklet. Of over 140 classes, 
some of the new courses offered are: 
Earthquakes— In a Nutshell, Parent- 
Preschool Child Ice Skating, Weight 
Control Over 30, and So You Want to be 
a Travel Agent, just to name a few. 

Asked about some of the more 
unusual classes offered, Hinkle smiled, 
"I don't consider anything to be 
unusual anymore. At first I would 
wonder why anyone would be interested 
in some of the classes we offer, but I've 
found that there are always people who 
are truly interested in such classes. I 
guess that it's all a matter of taste. 
What may appeal to you or me, may not 
appeal to someone else and vice ver- 

Trying to fill the demand of the in- 
terests of the community is what the 
Continuing Education Office seeks to 
accomplish and with the variety of 
courses they offer, and with the expert 
instructors that conduct the courses, 
they accomplish just that. 




Game wins new fans 



Degree available nights 



Weekend College gains 



By VICKI SCOTT 
Staff Writer 

Enrollment figures have increased 
again this year for the IPFW Weekend 
College, said Betty Worley, director of 
Weekend College. 

Since the program's beginning in the 
Fall of 1979, enrollment has gone from 
511 students with 1,534 credit hours to 
1,186 students with 3,573 credit hours as 



ofJai 



12. 



Business W100, the largest of the 
Weekend College classes, reached an 
enrollment of over 100 students, and 
nine other classes were filled to 
capacity. New classes have been added 
each semester. 

This semester one of the new classes 
I 



offered was Slav R261, Russian Culture 
and Civilization. 

Seventy-three regular college credit 
courses in 30 subject areas were offered 
this semester with only four classes 
being dropped because of lack of 
enrollment. Classes began Jan. 10-11 
and will end May 2-3. 

Both morning and afternoon classes 
are offered on Saturdays, and afternoon 
classes only offered on Sundays. The 
Weekend College sludents are not 
required to pay a parking fee. 

Although no firm plans have been 
made Tor the fall of 1981 IPFW Weekend 
College, Worley said that the number 
and breadth of class offerings are 
expected to be expanded.

New attention is being given to night 
and weekend students by the sociology 
department at IPFW. As of the fall 1980 
semester, all courses required for a 
four year degree in sociology are given 
in evening and weekend sessions. 

In addition, the Sociology department 
offers one of the heaviest summer class 
schedules of basic and advanced 
courses of any department on campus. 

Pete Ashton, a professor at IPFW and 
head of the Sociology Curricula 
Committee, said. "Our goal is to offer a 
full degree program through night 
courses." This gives students with job 
and family responsibilities a chance to 
earn a degree with less disruption of 
their personal schedules, Ashton said. 

Ashton pointed out that enrollment is 
up in his department, contrary to a 
national trend in sociology. 

While' there is no way yet to tell-how 
many students are taking advantage of 
the program, one sign may indicate it; 



sociology department during 
registration this semester was a 
Principles of Sociology class offered in 
the evening. 

However, there are problems with 
such a program. Some students feel 
more pressure in night classes. Many 
part-time students with full-time jobs 
also have family concerns. Assign- 
ments and papers may weigh heavily 
on them. Ashton understands these 
feelings, but said, "This is part of the 
choice of coming to college. 

"We are not a by-pass high or 
glorified junior college. I have taught at 
larger universities, such as Michigan 
State, and feel that it is our respon- 
sibility to provide the same quality of 
education as they do." 

Ashton then added. "The students 
must rise to the work, the work cannot 
comedown to the students." 

The origin of this program was an 
attempt by the Sociology department to 
improve schrtuling and to recognize 
the special needs and desires for 



The first class to fill in the evening and weekend students. 



Father fights to regain kids 

Editors Note: In this spennrt nf (wn *"' r-i .. «i._ i 



Editors Note: In this second of 
parts In his series about divorced 
fathers, writer Robert Rinearson In- 
terviews Don Clauson, a Fort Wayne 
resident and divorced father of three. 

By ROBERT 
RINEARSON 

Staff Writer 



What makes Don Clauson different 
from the other members of Fathers 
United is that Clauson 's three children 
are the victims of child snatching. 

"He's one hell of a man," said one of 
Clauson's friends, "and believe me, 
he's been to hell and back." 

Clauson is still fighting his 17-month 
battle to regain custody of his children. 
Despite a recent court ruling in his 
favor, his children remain estranged in 
Kentucky and his ex-wife has returned 
to Fori Wayne to appeal the court's 
decision. 

In August of 1979, a former 
housekeeper came to the Clauson 
residence while Don was at work, 
picked up his three kids and delivered 
them to his ex-wife, who waited across 
the state line in Ohio. 

"I suspected the housekeeper was 
mad because she lost her Job — a pact 
was made between them to kidnap the 
children," explained Clauson. 

Over coffee at his house, he described 
the story. "When Phyllis (his ex-wife) 
and I were first married, we were 
pretty happy, but things went downhill 
after that. She's filed for divorce twice 
before, but cancelled both times. At the 
time we finally got divorced, she was 
already living with another man." 

After a tough court battle, Clauson 
was given custody of the kids. "I never 
dreamed I'd lose Ihem like this " 
Clauson said. 

Clauson has been employed with 
International Harvester for the past 16 
years. Prior to that he was a Marine for 
four years, a truck driver, and had cut 
timber for a living. He also has earned 
many certificates of appreciation Tor 
volunteer service he's rendered to the 
American National Red Cross, Project 
Head Start, and the Allen'County Alert 
Team 601. 

' He's a big man whose large hands 
show the callouses born from hard 
work. But more than his physical at- 
tributes, his pragmatic knowledge of 
thelawisamazing. 

I "It was sink or swim," Clauson said. 
"After my ex got the kids, she headed to 
the hills of Kentucky for the security of 
her family. It didn't matter what the 
Indiana courts had decided. In Ken- 
tucky I had to start all over." 

Al the lime of Clauson's case, Ken- 



tucky had yet to adopt the Uniform 
Custody Act, a pending federal 
legislation which would require states 
to honor custody decisions of other 
states. All but six states have adopted 
the act. 

"I kept calling the Knott County 
(Kentucky) Police, which is where she 
went first. They kept telling me they 
didn't have any idea where she was. So 
that November a warrant was sent. But 
her attorney won on the point that my 
Indiana warrant was no good in Ken- 
tucky. And so she retained the kids. At 
that point, I was devastated; I wasn't 
finding sleep an easy chore then," 
Clauson continued. 

After that, Clauson's ex-wife moved 
to nearby Floyd County. But Clauson 
didn't cease in his persistance. 

However, his attempts at having 
warrants for the return of his kids 
honored in Kentucky failed, partly 
because the Kentucky authorities were 
related to his ex-wife, Clauson said. 

"There's a difference between hill 
law and practiced law as we know It," 
he said. 

Clauson poured us some more coffee. 
For an instant he seemed almost lost in 
time. 



He then told of more failure in 

Kentucky hearings, and his decision to 
hire a Kentucky lawyer to appeal the 
Kentucky court's decision. 

Throughout his ordeal, Clauson had 
vowed to act only within the boundries 
of the law, although he admitted that, 
because of the frustrations, illegalities 
had entered his mind. 

Neil Sandler, Clauson's Fort Wayne 
lawyer, felt Clauson ended up leaching 
some of the Kentucky attorneys about 
the Uniform Custody Act. 

"Don, by sheer determination, taught 
himself about the law and what he was 
up against. Long ago he decided to stick 
with the law and he did just that. Lesser 
men would have cracked," Snadler 
said. 

As we talked, it was hard for Clauson 
to speak about his children. He's not 
seen them since a year ago last 
December 10. He also feels his children 
(Paul age 10, Angela age 9, and Tina 
age 7) will feel differently about him. 
"Those kids are surrounded by her 
family. And seeing the extent they've 
gone through to keep me away from 
them, it would not surprise me to find 
out they didn't want to return," Clauson 
said.

Kentucky hy his ex-wlfe. Clauson is pictured sitting below photos of his three 
children — Paul, age 10; Angela, age 9; and Tina, age 7. (Photo by Keith Hall.) 



Clauson's files have become a collage 
oi legal paperwork that includes 
documentation on his ex-wife. Included 
are Phyllis Clauson's record of arrests 
in Kentucky for driving under the in- 
fluence and resisting arrest and 
unlawfully discharginga firearm. 

The files also contained a letter from 
his ex-wife's attorney that claimed 
Clauson had struck his children. 
Clauson said that when this letter was 
sent, in 1977, his ex-wife was saying 
anything to help her regain custody. 

However, Clauson then showed me 
signed affidavits in his behalf from 
several of his ex-wife's relatives saying 
they knew of no mental or physical 
harm brought to the children by their 

Pictures Clauson has of the house in 
Kentucky where Phyllis Claused lived 
with the children after the abduction 
show piles of trash on the floor, dirty 
water stagnating in (he undrained 
bathtub, many broken windows and a 
broken and unflushed commode. 

"It makes me sick to see my children 
living in those conditions," Clauson 
said. "But what can I do when the 
Kentucky authorities will go as far as 
Ignore a governor's warrant?" 

Clauson's Kentucky appeal was filed 
last Sept. 8. "They told me it would be 
three weeks, and I haven't heard from 
the authorities since," he lamented as 
we both watched the dreary January 
snow fall outside the window. Clauson 
contemplated what Phyllis might do if 
he won the appeal. 

"I wouldn't be surprised if she took 
off with them again to another state," 
he said. "But It'll be harder this time 
since so many more states have passed 
Ihe Uniform Custody Act." 

As we sat in Clauson's kitchen, 
something most unexpected happened. 
Breaking a moment of silence, the 
phone rang. Through the hallway I 
could hear only bits and pieces of what 
Clauson was saying. When he finally 
returned his eyes were clouded with 
tears. 

"Iwon,"hesaid. 

"What? " unable to believe my ears. 

"That's right, I won the appeal. I Just ■ 
can't believe It. At long last," For a 
moment of celebration, he poured me 
anothercup of coffee. 

The moment of jubilation was short- 
lived. The following Friday Clauson 
traveled to Kentucky on to be disap- 
pointed. He was not granted immediate 
cuslodyof his children. 

Instead, Phyllis Clauson Gamble was 
returned to Indiana and turned herself 
over to the authorities on the child 
stealing charges . 

Unfortunately for Clauson, the 
children remain behind in Kentucky. 



Many fantasize in 
dungeons, dragons 



ByKAROLHERBER 
Staff Writer 
"If you think there's nothing to do in 
Fort Wayne, think again," said Don 
Rapp, local expert and committed 
player of the fantasy game Dungeons 
and Dragons (D &amp; D). Along with 
several other role playing games 
currently on the market and selling 
fast, D &amp; D is becoming very popular 
with young adults, college students and 
many older science fiction and fantasy 
lovers. 

While this game has been in existence 
throughout the country for a number of 
years, local enthusiasm is currently at 
an all-lime high. 

Mention only an interest in D &amp; D and 
a number of involved players, firmly 
committed to the game suddenly 
emerge. 

Forming almost their own sub- 
culture, these D &amp; D players become 
extremely enveloped in the game and 
devote extensive time, money and 
efforttotheactivity. 

The object of Dungeons and Dragons 
is role playing, where each person in 
the game takes on the personality of an 
inaginary character they create for 
themselves. 

Depending on the roll of the dice, and 

how many points are accumulated, 
each player chooses which character he 
or she wishes to become from a 
selection of the ancient vocations of 
fighters, thiefs, magic users, etc. 

In turn, each of these characters are 
capable of achieving certain strengths 
of increasing levels, either physical, 
mental, or ethical in nature. 

Each player begins with limited 
powers and strives to attain additional 
strengths along the way, while 
acquiring magical aids — weapons, 
magical wands, armor, etc. — to assist 
them through the dungeon and to the 
possible possession of wealth and 

The gamers take on the personas of 
the characters they create as they 
maneuver and fight their way through 
the dungeon, filled with monsters, 
traps, and other obstacles. Because 
each person is unique, no two 
characters can ever be exactly the 

The leader or coordinator of the game 
is the DM, or Dungeon Master. By 
guiding the players through the 
imaginary dungeons, and by following 
the rules set down by the DM manual, 
he or she can direct the flow of the 



player and employee of The Jim 
Danndy Hobby Shop at Georgetown 
Square, which specializes in D &amp; D 
games, manuals, and figurines, some 
hand painted. 

Interested gamers may purchase the 
Basic D &amp; D set, complete with rules 
and model dungeons, at Jim Danndy's, 
other specialty and toy shops, and at 
the IPFW Bookstore. 

Because of the growing interest in 
Dungeons and Dragons, the Allen 
County Public Library, along with Jim 
Danndy's, is sponsoring a Dungeons 
and Dragons Day on Saturday Jan. 24 in 
the audilorium of the main library's 
new addition, at 900Berry St. 

Gail Milne, head of public relations 
there, feelsthe library is "...providing 
a community service..." for those 
people who enjoy playing the game so 
much. This special day will give D 4 D 
fans an opportunity to meet others 
dedicated to the game and have fun at 
the same time. 

Everyone is welcome to attend and 
observe, but only those already 




SEVERAL SETS of Dungeons &amp; 
Dragons game pieces, rule books, and 
handbooks ore availablefor all levels of 
play at Jim Danndy's Hobby Shop at 
Georgetown Square. The Allen Comity 
Public Library, along with Jim Dan- 
ndy's, is sponsoring a Dungeons &amp;

The DM is the only one who initially 
possesses the complete information of 
this fantasy dungeon, as supplied in the 
manual. 

However, with enough experience, 
players and DM's can create and 
design Iheir own advantures, monsters 
and dungeons. 

Playing a game of D &amp; D need never 
end, because there is no winning or 
losing involved. Players can continue 
on with their individual characters and 
raise them lo varying levels of 
strength. 

The players are not pitted against 
each other, but interact with fellow 
players and the DM in order to learn 
more about the foreboding environment 
of the dungeon they ore about to enter. 

Imagination and personal involvment 
are essential when playing D &amp; D, 
where escapists can leave reality 
behind and enter into an entirely dif- 
ferent world. 

"Your alter ego can play this game," 
snys Butch Vonderau, an avid D &amp; D 



familiar with the game and who have 
previously played D &amp; D are asked to 
participate in the actual games. 

Four dungeons will be drawn up with 
25-30 rooms in each. Approximately 
eight characters, with no subclasses, 
will be in each dungeon and will be 
assigned to each player before the 
game. 

Anticipated playing time is three 
hours. The morning game will start at 9 
a.m. and finish al noon, with an hour 
break following it. An afternoon session 
from 1 to 4 p.m. will conclude the day's 
activities. 

Those interested in being Dungeon 
Masters should call the library prior to 
the 24th and speak ioGail Milne.

Throughout the in- 
vestigation for my last two 
articles concerning divorce 
and its tragedies, I was 
confronted by confusion and 
depression. 

The confusion on my part 
was in how parents could use 
their children as pawns to 
get back at one another; the 
depression from seeing 
pictures of young kids 
living in squaller. 

I felt moments of anger 



when I heard how 

procrastinating lawyers use 
helpless children as an 
avenue for financial gain; 
and more confusion from the 
discrimination on the part of 
the court system that leaves 
the scales of justice un- 
balanced. 

I pray to God this society 
starts remembering that the 
children will be the 
carry the eternal scars. I'm 
confident the parents will 
survive ... But will the kids?

Ronstadt and Pat Benatar. 
In the past he has been 
compared to the likes of 
Springsteen. 

He is a large artist outside 
the country, but many people 
of his home state of Indiana 
have never heard of him 
Finally, after more than five 
years of slow record sales, 
John "Cougar" Mellencamp 
is starling to receive some 
long overdue notice. 

"I'm originally from 
Seymour, Indiana," Cougar 
said. "When I decided to 
settle down I picked 
someplace close. I've lived 
in California and London, but 
I still call Indiana home. 
Bloominglon's just a great 
town to kick back and un- 
wind in." 

Shortly after Cougar 
arrived in New York in 1975, 
he managed to land a record 
deal with MCA. After 
becoming disillusioned with 
the hype and lifestyle. 
Cougar left MCA In 1977 he 
signed with Rive records, 
becoming one-half of that 
label's roster of artists. 

"Between the time I left 
MCA and signed with Riva, I 
went through a divorce and 
lived in both London and 
California." During this lull 
Gulcher records, an Indy 
based firm, released an EP 
of Cougar's material. When 
asked about this Cougar 
replied, "'That EP was 
released behind my back and 
without any knowledge. 
When I returned home after 
nine months in London I saw 
Ibis EP with my nameon it," 
How did he earn the title of 
the original new waver? 
"Cteem has hyped that idea 
more than anybody and to 
them it's probably true. 
When I started out Iwore the 
same clothes that new wave 
acts are, the same haircut 
they have, and there are 
similarities in the material. 

My roots lie in sixties 
radio, A lot of my songs are 
about the night or the street, 
I think that's how the 
Springsteen comparison 
came about, his material 
deals with the same sub- 
jects." 

One of Cougar's major 
markets lies in Australia. '"I

number three down there," 
said Cougar. "At the time I 
wrote it I didn't intend for 
anybody &lt;o remake it. I don't 
know what it did for Ron- 
stadt, Her version made me 
a lot of money and I thought 
it was flattering that she 
would want to cover one of 
my tunes." 

His latest effort, "This 
Time I'm Really in Love" 
has enjoyed limited airplay 
in the stales. At presstime it 
was number one in 
Australia. "I wrote lhat one 
right after I moved to 
California. I had just gone 
through a divorce and was 
living out there when I met 
this really beautiful woman. 
That song is what was going 
through my head at the 

So what holds John Cougar 
back from becoming the 
success he has achieved in 
other markets? 

"Distribution is one of the 
prime factors. Riva Records 
and Gaff Management do a 
great job for me, but the 
distributing company screws 
off a lot," 

"Sometimes I'm pushed in 
areas outside my market 
appeal When I played in 
Fort Wayne, I opened for the 
CDB, but prior to that I had 
been doing West Coast dates 
with the Kinks. The Kinks 
are perfect for me, with my 
roots and all, because they 
are a product of sixties 
radio. Had I known thai I 
would be kicking for the 
Charlie Daniels Band, I 
probably would not have 
done the dates." 

The recent John Cougar 
and Ozone tour ended Jan. 
II. Now the band is getting 
ready to record their third 
LP for Riva Records. The 
Fort Wayne performance 
was one of a series of dates 
added after the tour was 
scheduled to end. 

Cougar must have failed to 
see the small groups of fans, 
possibly college students 
home for the Xmas break, 
that stood up all over the 
Coliseum and applauded as 
he walked off the stage. To 
their dismay, there was no 
encore.

Staff Writer 

Where can one go lo find 
delightful, inexpensive 
entertainment, taking part 
in uproarious laughter or 
tear-jerking pathos, under 
the pre-lext of babysitting a 
younger sibling? 

The answer is this: at a 
children's theatre. 

Fort Wayne has a 
children's theatre, the Fort 
Wayne Civic Youtheatre, 
which has been the home of 
that theatre since 1934. 

Youtheatre was originally 
known as Children's 
Theatre, and its purposes, as 
formed by the Children's 
Theatre Committee, were 
"to develop poise and better 
diction through creative 
dramatics, to give at least 
one play each year using 
children from the classes, to 
bring good entertainment to 
the city for the children, to 
teach children appreciation 
of good theatre, and to 
awaken their enthusiasm for 
beauty in art and integrity in 
dramatic literature." 



Youtheatre still fulfills 
those desires, and now, in- 
stead of doing one show each 
year, they do four. 

Besides the four major 
productions staged each 
year, Youtheatre also has a 
tour group, a mime company 
and a reader's theatre, all of 
which tour to local schools 
nursing homes.

bus; 



thousands of schoolchildren 
in to see each production, 
and business organizations 
have used its productions to 
entertain employees' 
children, or to contribute to 
the happiness of orphans and 
needy children. 

Youtheatre was housed in 
many buildings, beginning 
with the old Majestic 
Theatre. It appeared in high 
school auditoriums, the 
Palace Theatre, the old Elk's 
Ballroom and the Maiden 
Lane Thealre before moving 
into the Community Center 
(fir the Performing Arts,' 
where it is now located. 

It is in this Center where

Youtheatre presents its 
shows and offers classes that 
include Beginning, Inter- 
mediate, and Advanced 
Drama, Creative Drama, 
Stagecraft, Directing, Stage 
Movement, Musical Theatre 
Technique, and Jazz Dance. 
The classes are offered 
during the school year to 
youths from pre-school age 
through high school and are 
taught by a qualified, 
professional staff. 

Acting as the Managing 
Director of Youtheatre is 
Harvey Cocks, who has been 
with the theatre for three 
years. Cocks directs most of 
the productions and teaches 
many of the classes. 

Does he like working for 
Youtheatre? "1 love it. I 
really do." And is it fulfilling 
lo him? "Very fulfilling. I 
love talent. I love to find that 
spot in somebody and 
develop it, because there's 
talent in everyone." 
• Youtheatre is one ofTJTe 
oldest children's theatres' In 
the nation, Cocks said. Now 
in its 47th year, it has a class 



enrollment that averages out 
to 200 students, and it ap- 
pears before an audience of 
20,000 annually. 

It Is one of the few 
children's theatres in the 
nation that is run by kids for 
kids. Besides acting in the 
shows, youths behind the 
scenes stage-manage, assist 
set construction, run lights 
and sound, and manage the 
properties. 

The next Youtheatre 
production will be "The Red 
Shoes," which opens Jan. 23. 

Youtheatre is partially 
funded by grants from the 
Indiana Arts Commission 
and the National 

Endowment for the Arts. 
Thanks lo many local groups 
who have helped support 
them, including the E. Jane 
Hamilton Society, the Junior 
League, (he Fort Wayne Art 
School, and many com- 
munity volunteers, 
Youtheatre will continue to 
develop the talents and 
artistic awareness of Fort 
Wayne's youth.

Inconsistency reigns 



ByELLIEWOLLMAN 
Staff Writer 

Inconsistency continues to 
plague the men's basketball 
learn this season. As a result, 
the effective winning style of 
basketball that the Tuskers 
have shown they are capable 
of is being displayed in 
uneven performances. 

On Dec. 14, Marian pulled 
away from the struggling 
Tuskers leaving the IPFW 
team behind to face an 89-05 
defeat. 

"We played effectively the 
first half," said Head Coach 
Ken Workman. "We were 
taking the ball to the basket 
and playing our true style," 

Scoring during the first- 
half was evenly balanced, 
ending with a half-lime score 
of 38-38, but it fell apart for 
the Tuskers as soon as the 



second-half begai 

Marian outscored the 
Tuskers in the first nine 
minutes of the second-half 
with a 20-2 flurry. Trailing 
58-40, the Tuskers never 
recovered. 

Workman described the 
second-half takeover as "a 
result of a lack of patience by 
the IPFW team against a 2-3 
zone defense. We forced 
against the zone, had no 
patience, and didn't gel back 
on defense." 

Rickie Smith led the 
Tusker scoring with 34 
points; Brian Grady added 
10. 

Last Saturday the Tuskers 
were edged out in a tight ball 
game against DePauw with 
a 75-71 loss. 

The Tuskers held an even 
game till the last six minutes 



of the first-half when the 
team had its breakdown. 

Workman said the upset 
came "when DePauw got hoi 
and hit everything they 
threw . We stopped working 
real hard on defense, so they 
started gelling shots that 
they hadn'L been hitting." 

With the IPFW team down 
by 19 points at half-time, the 
action took a turn-around in 
the second half. The Tuskers 
got hot and chopped down 
DePauw's lead to only two 
points with nine seconds to 
play, but the clock ranout on 
the Tuskers before they 
could pull ahead. 

"It was too little, too late," 
said Workman. "If we would 
have had Another minute or 
so we would have won." 

Despite the loss, high 
scoring for the Tuskers was 



in double figures for Smith 
with 19 points, Grady with 16, 
and Rinard who added 13. 

Workman commented on 
the team's general per- 
formance uy referring to a 
need for the IPFW team to 
develop more "poise and 
patience." He said this was 
the main cause for the 
team's inconsistent play. 

Workman defined poise 
and patience, as it applies to 
the Tuskers, when he said, 
"It's keeping the basketball 
in our possession. We keep it 
moving until the opposition 
breaks down because they 
relax too much and give us 
an opening." 



He further explained, 
"Sometimes when the 
Tuskers look at a certain 
defense they adapt well, but 
next time down court if the 
defense has changed to a 
different look, our people 
become somewhat impatient 
and force the basketball, 
causing turnovers." 

Workman, however, feels 
that "consistent play, 
highlighted by poise and 
patience, Is a definite future 
reality for the Tuskers." 

With a 7-7 season record, 
the Tuskers were to have 
met Tri-State at an away 
game this past Tuesday.

Ladies set goals 




By CHRIS PVLE 
Chief Reporter 
In recent competition, the 
IPFW women's basketball 
team were defeated in three 
games against Taylor, 
Spring Arbor Michigan and 
Northwest Business College. 

"What broke the Taylor 
game was too many turn- 
overs," said Voisin. 

At halftime, Taylor led 21- 
26. The Tuskers got tough in 
the second half and tied 42- 
42. However, with 6 minutes 
remaining in the game, the 
Tuskers ran into turnover 
trouble and Taylor won the 
game 52-64. 

Kathleen Smith, who 
averages 11 rebounds and 13 
points per game, was leading 
scorer for IPFW with 17 
points. Jo Witte led the 
rebounds with 14. 

Last Thursday the Tuskers 
lost 46-73 to Spring Arbor 
Michigan, a team ranked in 
the top 20 in the nation in 
division III Coach Voisin 
remarked about the 
meeting, "They're tough and 
have a good ball club. We 
had too many bad passes and 
didn't get the rebounds. " She 
further added, "We're 
working on aggressive 
defense. But at times we can 
get overaggressive and foul. 



It's a learning experience 
loo." 

Saturday's game on the 
Tusker court — the IPFW 
women pitted against a 
former rival, Northwestern 
Business College. Earlier, 
the Tuskers broke a school 
record defeating North- 
western in a high poinl 
game of Bl -78. 

Al the halftime mark, the 
score was in favor of the 
Tuskers, 28-24. But they lost 
the lead during the second 
half when Northwestern 
came back on Ihe floor fired 
up. IPFW feli behind their 
opponents 8 points and 
Voisin called a time out. 
IPFW's squad caught up and 
they battled back and forth 
to the finish resulting in a 
one point loss 56-57. 

Northwestern may have 
led in scoring but the 
Tuskers outrebounded Ihem 
with 55 compared to 42 
rebounds. Smith tied iasi 
year's record for individual 
rebound high in one game 
with 20 rebounds. 

The Tuskers also set goals 
for their game. They wanted 
lo score 30 points during the 
first half. They accumulated 
28 and led 4 points going into 
the second half. Another goal 
was to end the game with 60 
points. They missed by only 4 
points. The third goal was

surpassed as they wanted 10 
less turnovers. The Tuskers 
only had 5. "We must set 
goals for each game and 
keep adding to it," said 
Voisin. 

Jo Witte, who up until the 
game had been tied with 
Smith as leading rebounder, 
was unable to play in 
Saturday's competition due 
lo a severely sprained ankle. 
She sal on the bench with her 
leg elevated and applied ice
