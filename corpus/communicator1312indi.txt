General student use of the building 
could also be expanded with the star- 
ting of athletic -oriented clubs on

Endsley said, and students interested 
In starting such a club should talk to

departments as elcctives or as

Although ARL departments such 
as English and Linguistics, history, 
sociology and onthropology, 
political science and modem foreign 
languages teach students for 23 
percent of all credit hours taughl at 
IPFW, only a percent ol the students 
major in those areas, 

Smulkslys accounted for the lack 
of a substantial increase in 
enrollment by pointing to a number 
of population and economic trends. 
Foremost among these was the end 
of the mosl recent baby boom, 
resulting in reduced demand for 
secondary education teachers, one 
or the Jobs filled by IPFW ARL 
graduates 

Clark Buller. chairperson of the 
philosophy department, noted that 
demand for philosophy professors 
will probably also remain stagnant 
as a result of the end of the baby

Yel although some students may 
lack an aptitude for Ihe technical, 
and therefore major In humanities 
or sodol sdencc disciplines, 
Smulkslys said Ihls did not mean 
Ihol such majors were necessarily 
weak in the sdencos. and thereby 
unable to enter a technical! y- 
orienled market. ARL now requires 
its majors to lake five courses in 
malhemallcs ond sciences, of which 
at least one must be In malhemabcs 
or computer science. 

"Some may question whether one 
course in malhemallcs, I for 
example), provides a sufficiently 
deep background," Smulkslys said. 
"My view is that perhaps the math 
and science requirement could be 
strengthened " 

He did say, however, that many 
ARL faculty members are con- 
cerned that science departments 
have discontinued foreign language 
which might detrimentally limit the 
graduate's ability to Interact with 
ncrease other cultures and thereby reduce 
ilverslly their Job opportunities. Still, hesaid,

throughout this decade." he said. 

The economic factors of inflation 
and unemployment have also taken 
their loll on ARL enrollments, 
Smulkslys said. "In times of 
economic uncertainty, people grasp 
for something more concrete and 
therefore they may opt for those 
disciplines that are more directly 
related tospecinctobs."hesald. 

Buller had mixed emotions con- 
cerning the role of philosophy out- 
side the classroom, however While

should not have much difficulty in 
entering technical fields. 

"The broad foundation which Is 
given lo ARL students develops their 
communl cation skills, improves 
their (critical and objective 1 
thinking and comprehension ability, 
and trains them In interpretation 
and analysis of data which I think, 
establish^ Ihe kind of foundation 
from which it would be relatively 
easy to move into a more technical 
and scientific Geld if one chose to do 
so. " Smulkslys said. 



"The demand (for graduates from 
Ihe sdenccs) through IMC is sup- 
posed to exceed ihe supply 
significantly." James E. Bund- 
schuh, professor of chemistry and 
dean ot Ihe school of science and 
humanities (SCI), said about Job 
openings for graduates of sdencc 
degree programs. 

"I Ihink it Is going 10 be a strong 
demand which is going to continue 
through the rest of Ih is coitury." 

Maynard J. Mansfield, chair- 
person of the deportment ol 
Mathematical sciences, echoed this 
viewpoint Tor graduates of his 
department. Computer program- 
ming Is part of our core curriculum 
and many of our graduates have 
taken more than Just the minimal 
amount ot (he bachelor's and 
master's level. One can certainly 
find cmploymenl as a computer 
programmer and that's oflen what 

Both Bundschuh and Mansfidd 
said they expect an Increase in 
enrollments In response lo this 
demand, but as of now. they have not 
risen substantially. Only 807 
students - 7.7 percent of the total 
student body at D?F"W-(s currently 
enrolled in SCI. Mosl students taking 
courses in Ihe SCI departments of 
chemistry, mathematics, physics 
and biology do so as elcctives as is 
evident by the fad that even wilh 
this small enrollmcnl. 33 percent of 
all credit hours are laught by SCI. 

Yd In additioo to science courses, 
SCI also Includes the social science 



and hum an I lies departments of 
communication. psychology, 

philosophy and thealer. 

Despite the increased job market 
demand. Bundschuh predicted thai 
enrollments won't skyrocket 
because of the rigorous 
mathematics prerequisites for 
chemistry and physics majors, for 












in some of these disciplines, sine 
the prerequisites are very tight and 
strong." hesaid. 

Upon completing SCI degrees, 
however, job possibilities for SCI 
sdencc graduates are good. Bund- 
schuh and Mansfield said. In the 
high school leaching area, Mansfield 
said a shortage was projected. "This 
past year people who were prepared 
to teach secondary school 
mathematics could find Jobs 
laJthough) not necessarily in the 
Fort Wayne area. " 

Using an example from 
chemistry, Bundschuh sold It has 
became increasingly difflcuil In 
recent years to hire Individuals with 
doctorates, in chemistry to teach on 
the col lege level. 

"When 1 was Ihe chair 'of the 
department of chemistry back In 
1975 and 1970. we would advertise for 
a position for a Ph. D. at the 
assistant professor level and would 
typically gel 150 applicants. In Ihe 
last couple years, we were lucky If 
we could get six or seven."

Friedman relates more

By CAROLYN ROGERS

Personal physical danger never 
existed in Poland so far as Lawrence S. 
(Stan) Friedman, IPFW professor of 
English, was concerned — eilher lo 
him or to any other fellow guest of ihe 
country— while he was there in an 
exchange leaching program from mld- 
1979 to August of IWs year. 

Relatives In the States were alarmed 
at the reports by the media and 
Friedman blames "media hype" for 



tbi 

"Rumania Is as bad," he said for 
example, bul lis situation has not been 
publicized by the media. Lack of 
realization that Poland's situation Is 
common to other East European 
countries puts things out of prospective , 
he fee Is 

Poland does have much to offer, he 
said. While it is a poor country 
materially. It does not suffer In com- 
parison wllh the United Stales 
culturally There the government 
supports and subsidizes the arts far 
better than does the U.S government 
Tickets to cultural functions are low- 
priced enough foranyonewhowanlslo 

Health care in Poland Is nearly free 
and much of the housing Is owned by the 
government which olfers low-renl 
apartments to the populace. Friedman 
explained Uiat socialism allows for 
everyone to have a right lo necessities 
ol life. 

Poland Is still rebuilding from World 
War lis destrudioo. which was M 
percent destroyed, has made a 
reasonable comeback, he said, but 
because of the shortages of money and 
materials it is far from recovered. 

Friedman calls Poland's Solidarity 
movement "the most Important thing 
that's happened in Europe since World 
Warn." 

Where Poland's sodety was once 
rigid and centralized — wiih no worker 
partldpatlon and no unions — workers, 
farmers, and students are now 
organizing unions and forcing effective 
changes. ■'Those changes will not afreet 
the daily routines of thdr lives, bul the 
whole spirit has changed," Friedman 
said. "People are suddenly free to 
speak o ut now on anything. " 




example dted by Friedman, 
Ihe new head of Warsaw University Is 
Ihe popular choice circled by faculty 
and students During Ihe past year 
department heads and thdr assistants 
within the University were also chosen 
by popular vole. 

This reversal of the traditional 
method or appointment of such officials 
makes university life in Poland al the 
moment far more democratic than 
ours. Here we have the illusions of full 
parti d pa lion with out actually having 
Ihe power to change much. Friedman 

In his personal opinion, he said, be 
would trust student Instincts In 
choosing the right person lor a 
university official post. 

A possible misconception of what the 
current revolution is really all about Is 
something Friedman emphatically 
wants to set slralghL Pales are not 
protesting socialism itsdf. he said, bis 
rather thdr lack of voice lo its 
management and administration They 
are not seeking a capitalist govern- 

Poles want socialism and they want it 
lo function well for them. Friedman 
said. The reforms they seek are to 
correct the flaws and make socialism 
more efficient for everyone In Poland.

Among all J.U. and Purdue regional 
campuses, IPFW has the largest library. 
This may not mean as much to some as 
having a championship basketball team, 
but how much help is a seven-fool center 
the nlghl before final exams? 

The board o( the Hclmke library has 
jusl approved a plan to spend some 
$300,000 for the purchase of new library 
materials, Some of these will be journals 
to be used in research and classroom 
Instruction, serving to increase the 
already strong business and technology 
sections of Hie library and lo supplement 
olher areas as well. 

A single calch exists in that IPFW 
doesn't have the money yet. We are not 
going to gel federal funds this lime, it 
has to come from local individuals and 
businesses. 

Of course The Communicator is in 
favor o( the school library gelling the 
half-million. For a college paper to be 
opposed to such an idea would be similar 
lo opposing Mom, apple pie and money 
from home All students and 



organizations on this campus shoulo 
unite in lobbying for these funds. 
Otherwise, when asked to donate, many 
will shrug, complain of hard times and 
light money, and reach for excuses 
instead of checkbooks. Some will say 
that a university is a wonderful thing, 
bul they want to put their money into 
more tangible investments. These 
people fail to realize that the training 
and education of human beings is the 
most tangible investment of all. Instead 
of simply trading one piece of paper for 
another, money Is exchanged for a share 
in someone's future, and if that person

"I'd like your name and

"WhyT" 

Kreskin' s road manager 
responded. "Kreskin 
likes Lo keep In touch vrtlh

about him," he said. At 
the risk ot sounding 
naive, I again ventured a 
"Why?"

said. By describing 
himself in this manner, he 
emphasized his slmllorily 



strangeness of (its skill, 
which might make him 
less acceptable and less 
believable. 

And Kreskin Is 
believable. If psychology 
is the science fiction Geld 
of science he claims it lo 
be, then Kreskin is an ST 
master. As with any good 
performer, he seduces his 
audience He fin Iters

disproportionate to logic. 
Another device be used

insinuating humor,

audience to finish his 
meaning "rackets" In 
their minds, while ab- 
solving himself of the 
responsibility of saying It. 

In my opinion, that's 
noi humor, that's 
cheating. 

Also, Kreskin 's name-

tiresome. I already knew 
about Johnny Corson,

John Stelnbeck't "Of Mice 
and Men" should have been 
an intense, deeply moving 
play, but It wasn't. In fact, it 
seemed more for the mice In 
the audience than the men. 

What makes Steinbeck so 
good Is the subtle way he 
evokes mood. He creates an 
intense subtext (hat mokes

characters, from the Jerod 
family in "The Gropes of

The strongest quality that 
stands out is the mood of 
emotions boiling Just under 
the surface of Steinbeck's 
characters. This mood is 
what makes most ot his 
works riveting, and it also 
makes you feel you know hit

and keyboards, mostly), he 
has worked with Elvis

Olivia Newton-John andB J.

music publisher, he was 
responsible for Ray Stevens' 
beautiful countrified version 
ol "Misty" a few years bock. 

But besides his marks In

The dim is basically a 
character study of two 
brothers, nnea cop. the other 
a priest, and about how they 
use power when a murder 
entwines both their lives. 
The film perfectly coun- 
terpoints their lives, their 
similarities and differences, 
and gives the film part of Its 
complexity. 

The best thing about the 
film is its understatement. 
Rather than go for a big, 
melodramatic soap opera 
about two brothers, director 
Ulu Grosbard gradually and 
quietly brings out the 
brothers' relationship. Mood 
is as Important as the story,

The acting from the

though not as powerful. The

such fine character actors as

In fact, never has a film

Dunne and Dldlon show the

by giving them a different

The limited edition of 50 10-

Knepper's views of church

Knepper said Fry chose 
him for the project because

derstanding of the project 
and the fact thai he and 
Kneppcr are dose friends. "I 
wouldn't do It for just 
anyone," said Knepper. "H's 
important that I know Fry." 
He calls Fry his biggest 
patron and said that Fry has 
been a source of much en- 
couragement. 

Fry admitted lhat his

Knepper has great potential 

"The lithographs are a 
combination of research and 
symbolism," Knepper said. 
"I wanted to show, 
especially in the portrait of 
Lulher, the darkness of the 
lime In which Luther had 
lived, and the bursting forth 
of light thBt took place 
through Luther — breaking 
the hold lhat Catholicism 
had on the European world.
