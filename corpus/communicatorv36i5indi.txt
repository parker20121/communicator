SPORTS WRITER 

NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER 



By Brianna Belford 



the five people 
you meet in heaven 



HEAVEN: His more 
recent book. The Five 
People You Meet In 
Heaven, is a number 
one New York Times 
Bestseller. 



The first Omnibus lecture for the 2005- 
2006 school year opened with author, 
sports writer, and columnist Mitch Albom 
Monday night. In attendance were young 
and old but all, according to Allium, are 
students but more importantly teachers. 

Refusing to fit the stereotype of a typical 
lecturer, Albom commented that he'd 
refrain from pulling out the yellow legal 
pad and bifocals, opting rather to speak 
from memory. 

"I don't think I need notes to remember 
what is in my heart," said Albom. 

The audience sat in anticipation to 
hear the words that had inspired Oprah to 
produce a major television movie for ABC. 
jack Lemmon and Hank Azaria starred in 
'Tuesdays With Morrie' and both walked 
away with an Emmy. 

The book is based on the final days of 
Morrie Schwartz, an old college professor 
of Albom's who, in his few remaining 
months of life taught Albom "life's greatest 
lessons." The lecture went on to talk about 
how Schwartz and Alhom had met. 

A small man with sinking green eyes 
and a smile full of crooked teeth stood keys.

Broberg earns U.S. patent with help 

■ System based off of mathematical algorithm receives patent for ability to improve software to engineer repetitive motion consitently 



By Jamen Ratcliff 

jratcllHaiprwcommtinlcaloron 



A patent for a "Tuned open- 
loop switched to closed-loop 
method for rapid point-to- 
point movement of a periodic 

has been accomplished by a 
professor at IPFW. The patent 
was completed by Professor 



Professor Broberg simplified 
the patent as "a mathematical 
algorithm to enable a computer 



in software." What it does is 
enable a device that has a 
repetitive motion to learn 
the process more accurately 



use it in weather satellites like 
the mi:S satellite. 

Professor Broberg is a 
married man and a father to 
two daughters, both college 
honor graduates, and a survivor 
of cancer. He has been at IPFW 
for 20 years and is currently 
teaching ECET 205. which is 
a microcontrollers class. The 
class consists of learning how 
to assemble and program 
computer chips. His 1 
record consists of a 
Chemistry from 
University, an M.S.E.E., from the 
U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, 
and a PhD in Engineering Irom 
the University of Toledo. He 
spent 20 years in the Marine 
Corps, of which three years was 
spent teaching. 

He designed the patent with 



grant they received helped 
fund the research. The patent 
was actually filed in |uly of 
2001. but he mentions that he 
and loe had to consult with 
lawyers about every year to 
rewrite, correct, and resubmit 
the patent to ensure that the 
legality ol it was perfect. 

The patent was accepted 
and put on the books as final 
on Feb. 3, 2004. He mentions 
that it was sponsored with 
government grants and since 
consulting for ITT 



He explained thai 



the patent can 
be viewed at http://www.usp to. 
gov/patft/ index, html US Patent 



# 6686716. 

So what's the next step for the 
patent? Broberg explained that 
ITT Industries puts together 
proposals for the government 
and the patent would probably 
be included with a newproposal 



with them any further at this 
time, he doesn't really know 
what progress has been made.

Softball opens 
fall schedule

The leaves are beginning to turn, a chill has 
replaced the summer sun and the Mastodon 
softball team is warming up before their second 
game of the season. Yes, contrary to popular 
belief, the Yankees aren't the only team trying to 
win this September. Three exhibition double- 
headers in the fall may not necessarily count 
towards their regular season schedule, but they 
do offer an opportunity for the coaching staff and 
the team to see various strengths and weaknesses 
before winter conditioning.

against Bethel College, and for the freshmen, it was 
their first opportunity to experience college softball. 
Bethel gave IPFW all it could handle offensively for

The game was not only a victory for the 
Mastodons, but an opportunity to improve upon 
last year's weaknesses.

would like in build nunc depth .it ih.it position."

"We need to stay focused for all of the innings 
and we need to play sharp." 




Like any athlete in her situation, there were 
times when Leit/ke wanted to throw on a uniform 
and get on the court.

and was promptly lead into the VIP entrance 
to meet the General Manager of Pierre's Todd

After speaking with Mr. Smith for a few 
moments he introduced me to Bret Sanders. 
I had the privilege of tagging along with Mr. 
Sanders, head of Promotions and Advertising 
for Pierre's. 

He gave me a small glimpse into what it 
takes to get a big name talent like Papa Roach 
to Pierce's. Pierre's has strived from humble 
beginnings to the entertainment complex 

They have suceeded in bringing some big 
name talent in the music business to Fort

Pierre's, introduced me to Cindy Miller 



host ot Miller lime We had a chance t&lt; 
chat while sitting in Cyb@T Club. I wi 
curious about her role in bringing talei 
to Ft. Wayne. She said it was a team 
effort, "We have a symbiotic circle..." 
speaking of the relationship between 
her, Pierre's and the people that are 
connected to the bands, like the record 

Miller expressed how much time it 
took contacting people over and over 
trying to reach a middle ground to get 
the talent here. One of the first things 
that has to happen is that what ever 
band is being pursued has to be coming 
this direction on it's way through from 
one major city to the next. 

Once the route is decided, Miller can 



i tag-along position. I have to admit 



now. Let me just state for the record 
that The Bear knows how to show a gal 
a great time. 

Just the fact that I was going to hear 
some great music from three great bands 
was exciting, but to add this group into 
the mix was almost too much. It was a 
crazy crowd and if you were there you 
know what I'm talking about. Hinder got 
us warmed up performing a few great 
songs including "Get Stoned."

Steven's talent, electetic and inventive, for songwriting, owes much to 
his muscianship- he is said to play 29 instruments-- and his creative expe- 
rience (he recieved a Master's degree in fiction writing, 
before he became a full-time musician) . 

Steven, who had played with Michigan b 
zukl, went solo in 1999, following the si 
album the Sun Came, and decided to stick with profes- 
sional music following ihc critical success of Greetings 
from Michigan. 

On lllinoise, Stevens has elluded the classifying 
the album a ""concept" album, but the work is clearly in 
the same family. 

The album is well researched, funny, and 
has remarkable depth, 
particularly in its refer- 
ences and insight.
