Provisions lacking 

More room needed 
in Fine Arts Building 

By this time next year, IPFW fine arts students will be 
traveling out to this campus to find a building beautifully suited 
to their needs. It will be an example of form following function, 
and will efficiently provide them with a comfortable working 
environment for years to come. 

This building is called the Chiller Plant. The thing they are 
building next to it, that looks like an aircraft engine factory, is 
the new IPFW Fine Arts Building. 

Don't expect an award-wtnnei oul Uin-c Tin- only ix^mhi 
they're building it is that the old facilities on Berry Street have 
a combustibility factor roughly comparable to the Zeppelin 
Hindenburg, and whose only possible tool of renovation might 
be a box ofd

"new" building to accommodate an ever-expanding fine arts 
enrollment. Instead, funding called for a replacement of the old, 
: facilities as they presently exist, or more exactly, as 
" ne ago when funding was granted. The new 
ill have to accommodate the significant 
se which occurred since the project's in- 
ception but also the surge in enrollment likely to occur when the 
new facilities become available. 

And provisions for additional faculty? Forget it. There is no 
art gallery, either. Somebody, somewhere in a future time is 
supposed to pay for the gallery to be built. Sounds familiar. 
Of course, there is always the possibility of expanding the

No, dear readers, the "Powers That Be" evidently figure that 
there are enough artists in the world already, and there is no 
sense in spending a lot of money to make room for more. 
Rather, they have chosen to erect a short-sighted solution to a 
problem as it existed years ago. While this new facility may be 
barely adequate for today's enrollment, we fear future art 
students, who will be instrumental in the continued growth of 
the department, will be forced to look elsewhere for their 

department), that future is practically
