Modernization plan presented

Edilar-i nair: Thil t. Ihr fim i" " '""■ 
imuinjr •rrir, nf atlielft cortring prap^trd 
pl^n, ,„ m„dfn,iir ihe IPFW rnmpu.. 

A subcommittee of Chancellor 
Wallace's Strategic Planning Task 
Force has drafted several proposals to 
beautify and modernise the IPFW 
campus. 

Professor Wayne Unsell and Pro- 
fessor Matthew Kubik, bolh from the 
civil and architectural engineering 
department, directed the project with 



the assistance of several student 
volunteers. 

Kubik slated that many of the plans 
made in the past for the existing 
campus have never been imple- 
mented. The idea of a main road ring- 
ing the campus was included in the 
original designs but remains un- 
accomplished. In the new plans for the 
university, a ring road edging the 
campus will be developed. 

The most recent proposals make the 
St. Joseph River the focal point of the 
campus To promote this concept, the 



master plan requires that the parking 
lots Iwtwcen Kettler and the river be 
removed. Picnic sites and a possible 
connection with the city's River 
Grocnwny Project would replace the 
parking space 

Kubik slated that the entrance at 
the Intersection of Coliseum and North 
Anthony was originally intended only 
as a service entrance. The new master 
plan will once again restrict that 
intersection to a service entrance. 

The main entrance will be off 
Crescent Avenue on U.S. Highway 37.

Color issue continues to grow 
as senates address controversy

Student Senate 
tables discussion 

The IPFW student senate voled 
Wednesday to table discussion on 
Purdue President Steven Beering 's 
actions regarding last December's 
color referendum. 

Kurt Gregory, in his presidential 
report, enplained Beering's position. 
The Purdue University president had 
ruled IPFW may use blue and white 
for athletics but must use colors rep- 
resenting lU or Purdue for other pur- 
poses Gregory also said Beering did 
not remember giving permission for 
IPFW to study the matter or lo con- 
duct ihe referendum, "But he did say 
he would give his permission 
retroactively," Gregory said. 

Gregory also said Beering would 
send him the letter the Purdue 
president had sent to Wallace, 

While Gregory said he supports 
Beering's actions, others strongly dis- 
sented "Doesn't Beering realize this 
was a democratic election held under 
due process of law? If we grab our 
ankles on this one, we'll look like we 
don't know what's going on. I person- 
ally was thinking of drafting a resolu- 
tion strongly upholding our referen- 
dum," said Dave Hollis, student 
senator. 

Gregory responded to Hollis, 
"Beering is aware of what's going on 
on this campus and in Fori Wayne. We 
can pass all the referendums we want, 
but if Beering says no we have to ask 
for his permission." Gregory said, 

Elizabeth Schlueter, student sen- 
ator, also disagreed with Gregory. 
"Our responsibility is lo represent the 
voice of the students and uphold what 



they told us " 

Schlueter also challenged Gregory's 
statement on Beering's knowledge of 
Fori Wayne evenU. "If Beering knows 
what's going on in Fort Wayne, why 
did he wail until the election was over 
to protest? The election had a lot of 
publicity," Schlueter said, 

"I think he was waiting for the out- 
come," said Phil Downs, vice presi- 
dent, "We have got to back up what 
we believe in. There are two ways we 
can strengthen the referendum. We 
can send a strongly worded resolution 
or we can send a diplomatically 
worded resolution to Beering, But not 
now while tempers are flaring." 

The motion to table was introduced 
by Robert Bishop who said the meas- 
ure would allow the faculty senate to 
consider the issue. 

Resolution passes 
faculty senate 

The faculty senate voted Monday to 
make blue and while official IPFW 
colors, although the move will not re- 
verse the decision made by Purdue 
President Steven Beering 

William Frederick, associate pro- 
lessor of mathematical sciences, 
moved lo lift from the table a resolu- 
tion to make blue and white official 
colors. Frederick, who had said red 
and gold made commencement ex- 
ercises look like a "cheap funeral" 
said "I want to clarify that the motion 
before us says the official colors for 
IPFW shall be blue and white. And I 
mean officially on all occasions. 

"This issue on colors seems like a 
tempest in a teapot, but I think it's 
gone beyond Ihal with the remarks by 
President Beering I have to agree 
with him the colors are all the more 



An archway will greet visitors to 
IPFW. Another part of the proposal 
includes a U-shaped drive (or 
dropping oFf students. 

The parking lots between Kettler 
and the river arc not the only parking 
places tentatively scheduled to be 
removed. The parking lot between the 
Classroom Medical Building and Neff 
Hall would also be eliminated to pave 
the way for a student plaza. 




IUI&amp;4W 



It is important to remember, Kubik 
added, Ihal all these proposals are 
still in the planning stage. There are 
several stages the proposals must go 
through before any plans are 
completed. 

Professor Kubik has offered to give 
a slide presentation ol the sub- 
committee's plans for the IPFW 
campus if the student body would like- 
one There has already been a slide 
presentation given to the faculty and 
administration. 

Currently the subcommittee has no 
plans to build a parking garage to 
replace lost parking. According to 
Kubik, flat-land parking places are 
$1,000 per space, parking garage 
spaces are S3,000 to $4,000 per space. 

Chancellor Wallace has said that 
there arc no immediate plans lo re- 
move parking but added that any 
parking which is removed in the 
future will be replaced. 



reason lor IPFW lo be independent If 
he has so much concern about whal 
colors we use. I think he has not much 
to do. So I think we should endorse 
official colors for IPFW. We need our 
identity," 

Art Finco, professor of mathemati- 
cal sciences, who introduced Ihe orig- 
inal resolution at the December meet- 
ing, agreed with Frederick "I don't 
see this as a move towards in- 
dependence as the president of the 
university or the editorial board of the 
Exponent (the Purdue University 
student newspaper)— who came out 
with an editorial I cannot believe— and 
yet Beering's own annual reports 
come out m blue and white. I see this 
as an attempt to gain some identity 
for ourselves." 

But not everyone present supported 
a separate identity Ken Perry, asso- 
ciate professor of manufacturing 
technology, favored the use of blue 
and white for athletics because IPFW 
does not play either lU or Purdue. But 
Perry also said, "I think when il 
comes to the academic programs I 
personally am proud to be affiliated 
with Purdue. I don't need a separate 
identity I'm a Purdue graduate. I'm 
Purdue faculty member and I'm 
proud lobe thai," 

Joel Rivers, assistant professor of 
psychological sciences, was also un- 
convinced, "I understand live other 
schools in our conference use blue and 
white. How would that make us more 
unique? 

Passage, however, does not override 
Beering's decision. After the meeting 
Chancellor Tom Wallace said, "The 
issue has been laid to rest because 
Beering has made his decision. The 
senate decision has no force but gets 
relayed to Beering so he can choose to 
review his decision." 



VoUeydons 
ranked 10th 
nationally 

BY MIKE LINVILLE 
Sports Editor 

Question- Who is the 10th ranked 
volleyball team in the entire 
countrv? Answer' If you said any- 
one else but the IPFW VoUeydons 
you're wrong. 

The January issue of Volleyball 
Monthly magazine, known as a 
leading authority on the sport, re- 
cently announced its pre-season 
picks for the top 15 collegiate vol- 
leyball teams. Coming in at the No. 
10 spot was IPFW. 

Even more impressive about the 
Dons lofty position is the fact there 
is no break down of teams into di- 
visions according lo school enroll- 
ment size IPFW is ranked with 
such familiar major universities as 
Penn SUte, UCLA, USC and 
Hawaii. The Dons are the only Di- 
vision II school ranked in the top 
10. 

I'm not sure if we're 10th in the 
country but it's a nice honor for our 
program and we plan to run with 
it," said head coach Arnie Ball. 

The honors didn't stop there for 
IPFW as the publication's 1988 All- 
American first team included Vol- 
leydons' junior outside hitter Jay 
Golsleyn. Golsteyn was Ihe player 
of the year in the Midwestern In- 
tercollegiate Volleyball Association 
last year and also received third 
learn All-American honors last 
spring, 

"Jay iGolsteyn) did really well 
at the 'S6 Olympic Festival in 
Houston and then was named the 
MVP of the conference as a soph- 
omore. For some one who has not 
played that long his credentials are 
impresssive." said Ball, 

Fort Wayne residents will get a 
chance lo see some of the lop 10 
teams in action this spring when 
IPFW will host the NCAA Vol- 
leyball Final Four lo be played at 
the Memorial Coliseum May 6 and 



opinion 



The Communicator 



Court rules 
Totalitarianism dominates 



In May, isai. a Hazelwood. Missouri, 
high school principal ripped out Iwo 
pages of the Spcclnim, the school 
newspaper, dealiriR with the effects of 
unwanted pregnancy ami divorce on 
high school students, On Jan. I3the 
Supreme Court baptized the principal's 
decision. This was wrong. 

...twenty years ago when the 
Supreme Court ruled that stu- 
dents "do not shed their rights 
at the schoolhouse gates. " 

In support o( its argument, the Court 
relies on what dissenting Justice 
William Brennan rightly calls "an 
ohscure tangle of three excuses," First 
the court slated the principal had the 
right to control the curriculum Justice 
Byron While, who wrote the majority 
opinion, pointed oul that the students 
received grades for their work on the 
paper, The paper itself was part of the 
high school's Journalism II class. 
Therefore the principal was exercising 
control over the curriculum, not cen- 
soring a paper. 

But as Brennan points out, that ar- 
gument was laid to rest twenty years 
ago when the Supreme Court ruled that 
students "do not shed their rights at 
the schoolhouse gale." 

Another reason the majority found 
was that the school has a legitimate 
interest in shielding high school stu- 
dents from unsuitable material White 
said school boards can protect high 
school students from explicit accounts 
of sex. But the fact is none of these 
articles had accounts of explicit sex 



Brennan points out that schools do not 
have to Ijccome "enclaves of total- 
itarianism" in which only the state's 
view is permitted. 

The last reason is that the school 
board has a right to disassociate itself 
from the paper. In recounting the facts 
of the case. White mentions that the 
board paid $5,000 for the printing costs 
of the paper. But Brennan points oul 
the board had a less restrictive means 
at its disposal. It could have printed a 
disclaimer 

According to Edmund J. Sullivan, 
director of the Columbia Scholastic 
Press Association, the decision may 
actually backfire on the very associ- 
ations of high school principals and 
school boards now praising the deci- 
sion. In the past, a school board under 
fire for something printed in a student 
newspaper could claim it had no power 
over the paper The Court has robbed 
school boards of this defense. 

The worst aspect of this decision is 
the message sent to aspiring young 
journalists The students in this case 
sued to protect their first amendment 
rights What they got was the message 
that the constitution is as Brennan 
quoted, "no more that parchment 
reserved under glass," Or as Paul 
McMasters, chair of the Freedon of In- 
formation Committee of the Society of 
Professional Journalists, Sigma Delta 
Chi, and a deputy editor for USA Today 
put it, "This decision cuts the First 
Amendment's legs off the student 
press" 



Parking problem accentuated 



It is a great relief to realize that the 
administration is finally taking an in- 
terest in the exterior of the campus A 
new entrance to the campus and a 
more organized roadway system would 
be a definite improvement Driving 
through campus would be made much 
easier. One would not have to worry 
about running down pedestrians or sit- 
ting at the light on Coliseum and 
Anthony 

11 is a good thing driving would be 
easier because there would be no place 
to park. 

According to the new proposals, the 
parking lots between the river and 



Kuttler Hall would be taken out, as 
would the parking lot between the 
Classroom Medical Building and Neff 
Hall. 

Parking is already a problem at 
IPFW and removing parking spaces 
does not make sense 

Of course the administration is as- 
suring everyone that new parking will 
be provided to replace the lost parking. 

Where will this parking be"! Will stu- 
dents be forced to park miles away and 
catch a taxi back to Kettler'' 

Improvmg the campus is a wonderful 
idea. However, this should not be done 
at the student's expense

—Letters to the Editor— 



Colors Important 

To the Editor: 

In response to an article 
in your opinion section, I 
would like to say (hat I 
difter somewhal with the 
view ihat the color change 
has received more atlenlion 
than it has warranted. If 
laken on a purely super- 
ficial level, it may certainly 
seem trivial; however, after 
considering President 
Beering's recent actions, il 
begins to generate some 
disturbing speculations 

/ cannot help but to 
speculate as to the 
condition of the 
lines of commu- 
nication between 
Chancellor Wallace 
and President 
Beering. . . 

The color change was 
approached by Students' 
Government from the outset 
with the approval and 



blessing of Chancellor 
Wallace. To now have his 
decision overturned by 
President Beering, T cannot 
help but to speculate as to 
the condition of the Imes of 
communication between 
Cttancellor Wallace and 
President Beering— clearly 
they are m a less than 
idyllic and undesirable state 
( particularly for those in- 
terested in the color 
change). 

Also, Students' Govern- 
ment had been planning the 
color change referendum 
for quite some lime, during 
which it received no input 
from West Lafayette Pres- 
ident Beering— even though 
the referendum was well 
publicized in The Commu- 
nicator and throughout the 
local media Why was Stu- 
dents' Government not con- 
tacted Iwtore a tremendous 
amount of energy was ex- 
pended by my colleagues 
and the voters themselves? 

Is it possible that Presi- 
dent Beering is not in touch 



with the issues of this uni- 
versity? While it may be 
possible, I am inclined to 
believe otherwise. II is 
clear io me that President 
Beering would not have 
voiced any opposition had 
the elected colors twen to 
his liking. Not only was this 
incredibly inconsiderate on 
his part, but also a drut&gt;- 
bing of the democratic 
process at IPFW, the stu- 
dents, faculty, and Stu- 
dents' Government, As

Year-end picks in review 



OK. this is it. It's 19SS, 
let's get down to it. But first 
olf, I want to say a word 
about what's going on 
around campus. No, I'm not 
talliing about (he tiigh- 
blown color controversy. 
That is so mindlessly fool- 
ish, it deserves no further 
argument. Ignorance can't 
triumph over logic. What I 
am referring to, however, is 
the feedback I received 
about my top picks of 1987 
last semester. 



Review 



When I am aslced why 
R.E,M. beat Bon Jovi to the 
top ten (Bon Jovi was my 
No. 1 worst). I really feel 
something must be said. 
IPFW is considered an in- 
stitution of higher teaming. 
Yet the student body con- 
siders it nothing more than 
a post-high school high 
school. To the city. It is a 
community college in its 
simplest form. Sometimes I 
think the only culture in this 
city is agriculture. Now I'll 
be the fii^t to allow people 
freedom of choice, but I 
can't tolerate closed- minded 
ignorance from people who 
haven't even heard of some 



of the t&gt;ands that made my 
top ten. I'm not going to 
review or even acknowledge 
music popular with ten- 
year-olds in a college 
newspaper, so let's gel to it. 
There were two late- 
,breaking albums in 1387 I 
wished to cover, but came 
loo late for me to review, so 
I'm going to review them 
now 

Camper Van 
Chadboume 

Camper Van Beethoven 
with Eugene Chadboume, 
This is a double treat. A 
Camper album with Eugene 
Chadboume, underground 
gum extraordinaire at the 
vocals? Put simply, this 
music is phenomenal. 
Camper Van Beethoven 
plays music like notxxly's 
business, a mixture of 
whacked-out jangly psy- 
chedelia, country, folk, and 
English pop-rock which Is 
arranged with a mad 
genius. Eugene Chad borne, 
a psychedelic hillbilly who 
never completely left 1969, 
piclu and yodels through 
this album with a warm 
grace. Covers of Pink 
Floyd's "Careful with (hat 
axe, Eugene," and Roger 
McGuinn's "Ballad of Easy 
Rider" are a pure dehght, 
as are the other twelve 
songs. If anybody's looking 
for a neo-60's music revival 



that is (resh and original, 
this one's for you, 
"••1/2 out ol five stars. 

In My Tribe— 10.000 
Maniacs 

After RE,M. and The 
Feelles, this is probably 
some of the prettiest music 
I know. Singer Natalie 
Merchant has the greatest 
female voice in rock today. 
The Maniacs play pretty, 
harmonious songs about 
everyday life, looked at 
through the gifted vision or 
Merchant. It really is no 
surprise that Merchant, 
whose group opened for 
R.E.M. on the first leg of 
the Document tour, is a 
close friend to R.E.M. 
singer /lyricist Michael 
Stipe. Merchant shares 
more than just music with 
Stipe; the two are idytli- 
cally matched One sets the 
same mystical feelings 
from both performers; 
truthful observations are 
conveyed with spooky 
bravado. And a cuter rock 
couple I couldn't imagine. 
Certain songs on this album 
stay permanently ingrained 
in your mind. "Hey Jack 
Kerouac." "Like the 
Weather. " and Cat Stevens' 
"Peace Train'" really stand 
out. but the entire album is 
just as good. Do yourself a 
favor and buy this one.

'Broadcast News'-worthy 



I have one bit of advice 
for you if you are planning 
to see "Broadcast 
News,"— leave before the 
end. Leave right after 
Albert Brooks, in the res- 
taurant with Holly Hunter, 
says "Son, it's not nice to 
make fun of fat single 
ladies." You'll be glad you 
left. Because if you stay, 
you wiU wince through one 
of the dumbest formulas 
ever conceived for ending a 
love-triangle story— an x- 
Rumber-of -years-later 
recap. 



Review 



Now don't get me wrong, 
I thought the plot and 
characters were reasonably 
well developed. I thought 
always-good William Hurt 
was well, good. Hotly 



Hunter gave a Tme per- 
formance while, however 
unfortunately, reassuring us 
that she indeed has a 
southern twang. Albert 
Brooks played a persecuted 
American citizen, in other 
words— Albert Brooks. 

James L. Brooiis, per- 
secuted American director, 
has put together this better- 
but-isn't-everything-by- 
comparison story of ethics 
in broadcast journalism. 

Many of the citizens of 
this country would be 
shocked to know what hap- 
pens, and everything that 
happens in this film hap- 
pens in real life. It is real. 

I felt for James Brooks' 
character and at the same 
time understood the ra- 
tionalizations of William 
Hurt's. This fdm made me 
want to stand up and yell at 
the screen to fill the char- 
acters in on what was going 
on behind their backs. I 
liked that. I felt the horror 
(a horror that was delayed 
for most until the rami- 



fications of the action were 
later explained) when we 
learned that Hurt's "Dale 
Rape" report was shot with 
only one camera. I liked 
that, too. 

All in all, 1 would say that 
James L. Brooks has re- 
deemed himself for "Terms 
of Endearment." but I can't 
say I hope this film goes 
down on anyone's list of all- 
time greats.

think someone says the "f
