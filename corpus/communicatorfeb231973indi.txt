Anthony Quinn stars as a 
tough, hard-drinking Indian 
who laments the social and 
economic neglect of his 
people in "Flap," the movie 
to be shown Friday, Feb- 
ruary 23, on the Indiana- 
Purdue Campus at Fort 
Wayne. 



The Student Government- 
sponsored film is set for 
either Room 146 or the 



Michael Yann, Chairman 
of Students' Union Board 
was in an automobile acci- 
dent last Thursday evening. 
He is confined to hospital 
bed at St. Joseph's Hosp- 
ital in Room 804. He has 
a telephone. Anyone want- 
ing to send cards or phone 
can do so by contacting St. 
Joseph's Hospital. 

The Union Board wishes 
to let the Student Body knew 
that it is now comprised of 
3 members and needs more 
applicants for positions 
with the upcoming Harbor 
Arbor Days events, and the 
need for fresh ideas as well 
as active workers. 

Applicants must be full- 
time students from either 
university. Anyone wishing 
to apply may pick up an 
application in Room 109, 
of the Education Building, 
the Office of Students' Gov- 
ernment. 

Students' Government is 
now passing petitions a- 
mong the student body in 
order to attain recreation 
activities such as tennis 
courts on this campus. 
Anyone wishing to help Stu- 
dents' Government 1 n at- 
taining these courts should 
come to Room 109 to either 
circulate or sign pet- 
itions. 



'Goes 
to Pot' 



Participants in an upcom- 
ing course at Indiana Uni- 
versity at Fort Wayne lit- 
erally will be "going to 
pot." 

The course, Creative 
Ceramics, begins Feb- 
ruary 21 and continues 
every Wednesday from 7 
to 9:3o p.m. for 10 weeks 
on the local campus. 

Dr. Stanley Lee, coordin- 
ator of fine arts for I.U. 
here, will direct the non- 
credit course in clay 
construction and decoration 
and team-teach with 
Mrs. Virginia Stevenson. 
The syllabus includes slab 
and coil building, model- 
ing and carving. Decorat- 
ing techniques to be taught 
are designed to place con- 
trol in the hands of the 
ceramist. Clay and glazes 
will be provided. 

Class size is limited to 
20 for better individual and 
group instruction. Those 
wishing to enroll should 
call the I.U. Office of 
Special Progra m s, 482- 
5811. 



recital hall at 3:30, 5:30 
and 8:10 p.m. Admission 
is free to campus activity 
card holders and $1 per 
person to the public. 

The movie tells the story 
of the legal but hilarious 
efforts of a band of Ind- 
ians to call attention to the 
despair and futility in which 
they live on a Southwest- 
ern reservation. Quinn's 



solution is to hijack a rail- 
road train, claim Phoenix 
for his tribe and precipit- 
ate the Last Great Indian 
Uprising. 

Quinn's co-stars are 
Shelley Winters, Claude A- 
ktns, Tony Bill and Victor 
Jory in this screen version 
of Clair Huffaker's best- 
selling novel, "Nobody 
Loves a Drunken Ind- 
ian." 




Some of the women in attendance at the first All-University 
Women's Caucus held last Tuesday discuss the problems of 
discrimination and child-care with the panel. 



Black Hour 
Blues 

Fort Wayne Folk School's 
Theatre for Ideas will pre- 
sent the program, "Black 
Hour Blues. An In-Depth 
Look at Mental Depres- 
sion," tonight at 8 p.m. at 
the Plumb Line in the First 
Wayne Street United Meth- 
odist Church. Located 
at 910 Broadway. 

The discussion panel will 
include: Dr. Byron Kilgore, 
Psychiatrist; and Dr. Jodi 
Kassover, Staff Psycholo- 
gist. 



Appeals Board 
Meets Monday 



Parking ticket appeals of 
four IPU staff members 
and five students will be 
heard by the Campus Traf- 
fic Appeals Board on Mon-

meeting is set for 2:30 p.m. 
in Room B35 of the library. 

Staff members whose ap-

Mead, Werner Manheim, 
and Bernd Erdtmann. Stu- 
dents whose appeals will

pat Toy, Mike Stone, 
Robert Jones and Jane 
Nusbaumer, whose appeal 
was re-scheduled from the 
last meeting. 

A temporary student re- 
presentative to the board 
is to be appointed by Brock 
Able, Student Body Pres- 
ident. The student will sub- 
stitute for Mike Yann, who 
is being hospitalized from 
a recent car accident. 



"Frankly Speaking" 



reactions 



Dear Editor: 

We would like to take this 
opportunity to thank the 
Student Union Board and in 
particular Stan Scheiman 
for their time and effort in 
sponsoring the ski trip last 
Saturday. It certainly must 
have been one of the most 
worthwhile undertakings of 
the SUB this year. We hope 
they are considering a- 
nother trip at lea st next 
year if not another one for 
this year.

Dear Editor: 

"Name Withheld by Re- 
quest," writing in the Feb- 
ruary 16 issue on the abor- 
tion controversy has 
brought several points to 
light. 1) The writer states 
that a person (presumably 
female) who wants the 
''right to have an abortion 
when they need it,... should 
have it." The only reason- 
able need for an abortion 
(if the life of the mother is 
endangered) is, or at least 
was, protected by the indi- 
vidual states of the Union 
long before the Supreme 
court began to enact laws. 
What the Court ruled and 
what the author implies is 
abortion on demand for 
convenience. For conven-

lence. Death for conven- 
ience ? 2) The author states; 
"So, it is against some peo- 
ple's moral judgements, so 
what." An analogy. It was 
against some peoples mo- 
ral judgement that what hap 
pened at Auschwitz and Da- 
chaw was acceptable. So 
what. The central question 
in the abortion issue is 
whether what is being a- 
borted is or is not a hu- 
man life. If It is, and I for 
one am not willing to play 
God and say that it is not. 
then the author's "so what" 
has the ring of Bormann 
saying that they're only 
Jews, so what, why the 
fuss. 

Stan Jones 
Dear Editor: 

Every Friday since the 
beginning of the school year 
during the afternoon and 
evening hours, the Film 
Series Committee of Stu- 
dent Government has been 
showing films of a cul- 
tural and entertaining na- 
ture free to all activity 
card holders. 

This year, for a change, 
students have a majority 
voice in the committee 
which is given the respons- 
ibility of using Student 
Activity Fee money to bring 
films of significant stature 
to our campus. Thus change 
has resulted an increase 
in attendance, quality of 



films and revenue, all of 
which have benefitted the 
students. 

While student control of 
the committee has tremen- 
dously effected these in- 
creases, there are other 
factors which have also 
contributed greatly to the 
success. Particulary im- 
portant to the committee 
are its two faculty mem- 
bers Don McAleece and 
Ann Ladd, and the Learn- 
ing Resources Center 
which furnishes the equip- 
ment and projectionists for 
the films. The third fac- 
tor which has contributed 
much is this newsDaper. 
The Film Series Com- 
mittee would like to ex- 
press its appreciation and 
gratitude to the Communi- 
cator, its news editor and 
editor for the efforts time 
and space for which they 
have given to the releases 
for the films. The coop- 
eration of the Communi- 
cator and its staff (both 
past and present) has been 
fantastic. In addition to 
publicizing the films the 
paper also keeps the stu- 
dents informed as to the 
activities being funded by 
Activity Fees. 

So get your money's 
worth; read the Activity 
Fee Supported paper; and 
attend Acticlty Fee spon- 
sored events, particularly 
the Film Series this Fri- 
day.

TRACES 

After all the politics, the 
wars, the public outrage, 
there seems to be nothing 
left. Nothing to hold onto. 
Everything reachable is 
vacuous, sad grey. As soon 
as the color begins to ap- 
pear, it begins to waver. 
And as we should expect, 
it soon falls without a touch, 
without a complaint. That's 
the part that bothers me... 
not the slighest complaint. 
Not once has there been a 
revolution for "little peo- 
ple"; not once has there 
been an uprising for tears 
and laughter. 

There seems nothing left 
even to be said. Nothing to 
say. Nothing in the news, 
less unusual. Less unusual 
means getting old, reaching 
its heights, fulfilling all the 
potentialities leaving the 
carcasses of dying dreams 
far behind. Does one pro- 
phesy hi story? Does one 
dare proclaim the "waste- 
land" growing? By what 
right? Out of what concept- 
ual framework? Practi- 
tioners and craftsmen find 
delusional paranoia inter- 
esting for a moment. The 



victim of such labelling ne- 
ver escapes the interest. 
By what right? 

Because there Is nothing 
left, commitments are con- 
structed early and children 
are taught to grow old. 
Because there is nothing 
left, one can only lessen 
oppression only by oppres- 
sing more. Schizophrenia 
becomes inviting while ed- 
ucational processes show 
us morality first-hand, 
honestly, without re- 
morse. 

Oh how much we un- 
derstand! How sophisti- 
cated we have become in 
analyzing wars. And to ap- 
pease this undying incon- 
gruity we teach Eastern 
"philosophy" in a western 
university. Odd, how much 
we have accomplished with 
our sophistication! How lit- 
tle reverence there is for 
thought. The great Paulline 
Contradiction: the military 
chaplain. And America: the 
finest example of Western 
thought gone beserk. There 
is simply nothing left. 

Yes, these things are true. 
But then, there goes an- 
other color. Please let this 
one live...

3 FRANKLY SPEAKING Posl 



From the President's desk 

by Brock Able 



Sometimes, I wonder just 
what it takes to get people 
involved in doing things for 
themselves. For over a 
week I have been Dassing 
out petitions to ask the Joint 
Athletic Committee for 
some tennis courts. For 
myself, I will never be able 
to play tennis. I want them 
to play tennis. I want those 
tennis courts because many 
students tell me that they 
want more recreational 
activities on campus. Al- 
right, here is a chance. 

Everything has an order. 
If we can get tennis courts 
then we can go for basket- 
ball courts, or whatever 
else you students want. We 
must work together on 
these issues. 

I know also that there are 
about a million other things 
that are needed oncampus. 
Well, those holes in the 
parking lot are not going 
to get fixed by lip-service. 
People sure like to talk, 
but when we ask for help 
where are they? 

I have been in the Students' 
Government for two years, 
during that time I have only 
seen two or three people 
ask us how they could help 
with and 

with any projects. The stu- 
dents here would not even 
sign a petition to save their 
own campus. So, when it Is 
too late those students are 
going to be the ones who 



scream about nobody doing 
anything. 

Students may as well real- 
ize that paid parking is here 
to stay. The activity fee is 
here to stay, also. Now, we 
can do two things. One, give 
a lot of lip-service, which 
has not worked before. Or, 
two, work within the system 
and exert some student po- 
wer. Believe me, names on 
petitions work. 

I do not intend to offend, 
but, we in the Students' 
Government are working 
for you, the students. Sure, 
like I have said, we all want 
something, however, the 
funds go just so far. So, 
we set some kind of order 
to what we do. Remember 
someday there may be 
something that you may 
want and no one will sign 
your petition either. We 
must work together! 

I think at this time we all 
should wish MikeYannalot 
of luck with h i s recovery 
from an auto accident. Mike 
is the chairman of the U- 
nion Board. He had a great 
deal to do with the expand- 
ed dance and concert series 
we are having. What the Li- 
nton Board now needs is 
people who are willing to 
work with what I consider 
a good series of dances. 
Anyone who is interested 
should apply with Rusty 
Cane the Vice-Chairmanof 
the Union Board.

Nan-in, a Japanese master, received a university pro- 
fessor who came to inquire about Zen. Nan-in served 
tea. He poured his visitor's cup full, and then kept on 
pouring. The professor watched the overflow until he no 
longer could restrain himself. "It is overfull. No more 
will go in!" "Like this cup," Nan-in said, "you are full 
of your own opinions and speculations. How can I show 
you Zen unless you first empty your cup?"
