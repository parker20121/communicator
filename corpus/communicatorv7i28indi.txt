year 2000 To say that 1 PI' Wat present is eonmrminn to the plan in its development 
is anothcrr matter, entirely The J.J.&amp;R. plan, developed in 1%6. shows that by 
1973, IPFW would consist of eight buildings, Consisting of three 
classroom-lab-office-research buildings, one administration building, two 
library-research buildings, a student union building, and an enclosed parking 
garage, all identified as stage one in the master plan. The second stage, from 
i!i7l l'i7!i, would add two more classroom structures, another library-research 
building, a 150,000 square foot auditorium, and an additional 9:iB-car parking

Higher education Commission, the Slate Budget Agency and the General 
Assembly provide the answers A report prepared last summer by an IPFW 
student showed the dramalii disparity in the allocation of higher education funds 
across the stale, with the Northern area of the state scandalously short of funds. 
State legislators representing the Fort Wayne area were mode aware of that fact, 
and were enlisted to make the entire (leneral Assembly aware ol the problem Vet. 
nothing has been done to allocate more rnonej (or I he Norlhern area of the state. 

It's time to ask why. Why Is IPFW so far behind its long-range plan for 
development': Why does the Northern area of the slate continue to be 
short changed in the allocation of higher-education monies-' Why is it that the 
student body at IPFW must use its enlei lainment money hi provide tennis courts 
for the whole campus community P ' When are Ihc legislators representing the Fort 
Wayne area going to demand their fair share of the higher-education pie? 

IPFW needs more classrooms, more lab-research facilities, and a 
physical-educalion-audltorium. Is the State of Indiana going to make the students 
pay for Ihese buildings, too? 



Hell no, no dough! 

Once again. Ilarbiuarbar Days at IPFW are upon us. Once, again, the Student 
Union Board has posted notice of a one-dollar fee for parking during the Rock 
Concert on Saturday, April 24. 

Let's try one more once again (luce again, we stale emphatically that persons 
who have paid then parking fee for I he year, anil are displaying a parking sticker 
on their ear, should refuse to pay that dollar if you plan on coming to the campus

An lU-Purdue program 
which trains you for 

management 
before you graduate 



Many jobs you'll find as a 
college graduate are designed to 
develop your basic management 
skills. And often require a year or 
more before you get any real 
supervisory responsibility. 

Army ROTC gives you your 
management training up front... 
while you're still in college. Then 
challenges you with instant respon- 
sibility in your first job as an Army 
officer. And starts you out at over 
510,000 per year. 

And now, lU-Purdue offers you 
Army ROTC courses on campus. All 
current freshmen and sophomores 
are eligible. 

Sophomores: you must apply 
now for a special six-week summer 
program at Fort Knox, Ky., where 
you'll prepare, mentally and physi- 



cally, for advanced ROTC. You'll 
earn over $500 while you're there. 
And incure no obligation until you 
register for ROTC in your junior 
year. It's then you start earning $100 
per month (up to 10 months per 
year) for your last two years at 
lU-Purdue. 

Freshmen: pre-register for 
ROTC this spring and double up on 
1st and 2nd year courses next year. 
Again with no obligation until your 
junior year. 

Veterans: if you have two or 
more years of college remaining, 
you already qualify for advanced 
ROTC. Pre-register this spring. 

For details, see your academic 
advisor or contact Major Dick 
Reinholtz in Room 288F Neff Hall or 
call 482-5416.
