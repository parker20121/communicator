Facts about Super Bowl Sunday 



XLIII 



This will be the only Super Bowl to feature two teams 
that once were the same team. In the 1944 season, due 
to depleted rosters because of World War II, the two 
teams were actually merged to form the "Card-Pitt."

Just 14 states have higher 
unemployment rates than Indiana, 
according to the United Slates 
Depariment of Labor, last updated 
on Dec, 19, 2008. With the economic 
doivniurn amidst all United Slates 
citizens and large companies such 
as Microsoft Corporation laying off 
employees, more and more people 
must rely on resources such as food 
banks in order to survive. 

Seeing an opportunity lo band 
together lo help American citizens 
and strengthen lies between schools. 
The Summit League Athlete Advisory 
Committee (SLAAC) organized a 
school verse school Food Fighl. Each 
school chose a food bankin iheir area 
to collect as much canned food and 
nonperishable food items as possible 
I for within a iwo-week period. IPFW 
chose to go with Ilie Fort Wayne 
Community Harvest Food Bank. 

"With ihe dovmium of the 
economy, Fort Wayne and Allen 
County will see an increase in people 
relying on food banks," Leslie Clark, 



IPFW Director of the MAP Center, 
said. "It will benefit the Fort Wayne 
community and their shelves were 
pretty much empt&gt;' due to the state 
of the economy." 

IPFW began collecting food on 
January 17al basketball and volleyball 
games on campus with the goal of 
coilecling at least 10,0(10 pounds of 
food. According to SLAAC President 
IPFW volleyball player. Matt Pliske, 
the goal is not even close to being 
met and the last day to donate food 
for this competition is January 31. 

There are collection bins around 
campus, in the lobby of Gates Sporls 
Center and will also be at the men's 
volleyball games Friday and Saturday 
nights at 7 p.m. 

At the end of the competition, the 
total amounts of food will be tallied 
by pounds raised, and the winning 
university will be awarded a traveling 
trophy, which will be housed at the 
Food Fight champion's school after 
the competition each year. 

Tliere may also be other prizes 
in addition to the recognition of the 
community and the appreciation of 
those who rely on the Community 
Harvest Food Bank to get by.

Student Senate meetings may be broadcasted in near future 




student Body 
Presidential Address 



Recently some mem- 
bers of student govern- 
ment have been tossing 
aroimd the idea of vid-^ 
eotaping meetings of 
the Student Senate. 

Taping student gov- 
ernment meetings is 
something that many 
other student govern- 
ments across ihe coun- 
try have been doing for 
years. Now, it may be 
time for IPFW to follow 



suir. 

There are people who 
favor this idea and some 
that oppose it. On one 
hand this would offer the 
student body more ac- 
cess to the Student Senate 
meetings. They could he 
aired on the campus tele- 
vision station a few times 
a week and they could 
also be made available 
on tlie IPSGA website or 
evenYouTube. This would 



make it much more con- 
venient for students to 
follow what is going on 
without attending the 
meetings in person. This 
would also increase the 
overall awareness of stu- 
dent government and 
create a better sense of 
accountability. 

With all changes there 
will be potential down- 
sides. If Senators know 
that many more people 



will be viewing their ac- 
tions tliey might be less 
hkely to speak out on 
certain issues for fear of 
being treated negatively 
by students vyho may dis- 
agree. This could poten- 
tially limit good debate. 

However this could 
easily happen with the 
way things are set up 
currently. All meetings 
of the Student Senate are 
open to the public and 



all documented records 
are also available upon 
an Individual's request. 

If'you have an opinion 
on this issue please con- 
tact the Vice President of 
Legislation Melissa Cor- 
nish to express what you 
think should happen to 
these meetings. We arc 
here lo represent the stu- 
dents and we want your 
input as to how we can 
do that even better. 



The closing of Guantanamo Bay: More tlian just a prison op-Ed 



By Dan Jehi 

Da n . J Eh I @i phv CO min u n i rati 



It didn't take long. l\vo 
days after being sworn in 
as Americas 44th presi- 
dent, Barack Obama sent 
a message heard around 
the world, 

Obama signed Execu- 
tive Orders to shut down 
the political detention 
center in Guantanamo 
Bay. This illegal prison 
is notorious for holding 
possible terrorists and 
for its seven-year his- 
tory of alleged Geneva 



Convention and United 
Nations-based human 
rights violations. This 
place even blocked UN 
Commission on Human 
Rights inspectors from 
seeing the prisoners, 
compelling the Com- 
mission to cancel the 
inspection. 

Guantanamo Bay 
was most recently 
opened by former 
President George W. 
Bush after the terrorist 
attacks on 9/11. 
Shutting it doivn was a 
"shot heard around the 
world," with Obama 
stating that the US 



stands for human rights 
and a better way. 

In reversing Bush ad- 
min is Ira lion policies, 
Obama said he wanted to 
show the world that the 
United States ivill pursue 
the struggle against ter- 
rorism "in a manner that 
is consistent with our val- 
ues and our ideals." 

This will mean an end 
to seven years of policies 
at an off-shore polid- 
ca! prison for suspects or 
"enemy combatants" that 
Amnesty International 
said "violated' human 
rights, treaties, law and 
morality."

Babystep into investments 

Take small risks before taking a big plunge 



By Jessie Ruckman 

Jessie.RuckmanO 
ipiwcommunicator.org 

How did you first 
learn to swim? Did your 
mom or dad chuck you 
into the water and yell, 
"paddle or drown, girl!" 
while you kick and fight 
for your life? Not likely. 
They probably started 
you otf with those bright 
orange "floaties", and 
held onto you while 
you learned the basics 
- floating, paddling, and 
eventually swimming on 
your own. 

It's the same way with 
investing. The odds are 
good that the average 
new investor doesn't 
just walk into Merrill 
Lynch, toss a few grand 
on the table and say in 
detail where he wants his 
money allocated. It's just 
as likely that the aver- 
age college-aged inves- 
tor doesn't have a few 
thousand dollars at all, 
let alone to say goodbye 



to for months or even 
years while it's growing 
and working for you. 

So how does one be- 
gin investing without 
fistfuls of money? 

Do your homework. 
Although many of the 
"larger" investment 
firms demand a large 
chunk of money up 
front in order to gain 
personal services and 
face to face communi- 
cation, there are others 
that will Stan off your 
investing endeavors 
vrith only $25 monthly. 

TVy Primerica Group 
for example. The goal 
of Prirrierica is to help 
beginning investors to 
get their foot in the fi- 
nancial door. 1 began 
my Roth IRA about five 
years ago with an initial 
investment of $25 per 
month that was auto- 
matically withdrawn 
from my checking ac- 
count. I even get to 
choose the day of the 
month that the money 
is withdra'.\Ti. Today I 



mvest S75 monthly in the 
hopes that investing while 
the market is down will 
help lead to larger gains 
when the inevitably econ- 
omy rights itself. 

Be careful into which 
avenue you invest though. 
I would suggest mutual 
funds or IRAs because of 
their overall stabilitj; av- 
eraging about 10 percent 
annual gromh. 

Be weary of the stock 
advertisementsthatptom- 
ise "500 percent gains in 
just 2 weeks!" Just because 
that may have happened 
to one person, the rest of 
the population \vill likely 
get the short end of the 
deal. 

Slow, steady growth 
is the smartest way to in- 
vest, and beginning with 
minimal investment is an 
easy way to get your confi- 
dence up, and build capi- 
tal for future trades. 

If it sounds too good 
to be true, it probably is. 
Start with baby steps and 
take it upon yourself to 
become educated. 



Hope frilly, this also 
means the end of mis- 
guided policies and a 
true break from the past 
with a strong message 
for places in the world 
besides Guantanamo. 

It means no more 
"preventative detention," 
the practice of holding 
suspects for long periods 
of time and then holding 
"kangaroo" court ses- 
sions at the camp itself. 

It marks theendofsto- 
ries like the three British 
Muslim prisoners, known 
as the "Tipton Three," 
who were released in 
2004 ivithout charge. The 



three have alleged ongo- 
ing torture, sexual degra- 
dation, forced drugging 
and prosecution by U.S. 
forces at Guantanamo. 
Most significantly, it 
means the end of using 
the camp as a warehouse 
for humans. 

Both Bush presidents 
did it. The first President 
Bush in the early 1990s 
warehoused about 300 
innocent Haitian po- 
litical activists who fled 
their homeland after a 
military coup. The Hai- 
tians' crime? They were 
HIV-positive at a time of 
fearandignoranceabout * 



AIDS, Warehousing was 
the White House answer 
to keeping the Haitians 
out of the United Slates. 
The Justice Depart- 
ment's legal defense: The 
US Constitution, federal 
laws, and the Geneva 
Convention did not ap- 
ply at Guantanamo. In- 
nocent people got hurt, 
and the US was the tar- 
get of international criti- 
cism. President Bill Clin- 
ton released them in the 
mid-nineties in response 
to a federal court order.

A report of the United 
Nations Committee on

stated that of the 2,500

since 2001, eight juve- 
niles had been held in 
the Guantanamo Bay de- 
tention camps. 

Political suicides were 
not prevented. By 2008 
there had been at least 
four suicides and hun-

in Guantanamo that are 
public knowledge. How- 
ever, nobody knows how 
many there really were 
since no information is 
available on the number 
of suicides or suicide at-

classified as secret. 

In June 2006, three

were found dead. Ac- 
cording to the Pentagon, 
"(They) killed themselves

Day 3l Bush abortion-funding policy 

reversed by Obama 



By Katy Andersi 

Kaly.AndEcsan@ 
iptmcdmmunicator.Drg 



In his first few days in 
office. President Barack 
Obama is already making 
strong efforts to reverse 
controversial policies of 
the George W. Bush ad- 
ministration. 

On January 23, 
President Obama struck 
down the Bush admin- 
istration's previous ban 
on giving federal money 
to international groups 
that perform abortions 
or provide abortion in- 
formation, according to 
the Associated Press. 

According to white- 
house.gov. The Foreign 
Assistance Act of 19B1 
"prohibits nongovern- 
mental organizations 



that receive Federal 
funds from using those 
funds "to pay for the per- 
formance of abortions 
as a method of family 
planning, or to motivate 
or coerce any person to 
practice abortions." 

This plan, also called 
the "Mexico City policy," 
was initiated by Presi- 
dent Ronald Reagan in 
1984 and then cancelled 
under the Clinton ad- 
ministration. 

On the second day 
of his first term in office, 
George W. Bush reinstat- 
ed this policy and man- 
dated that any organiza- 
tion that received U.S. 
family-planning funds 
from the U.S. Agency 
for International DeveU 
opment could not offer 
abortions or abortion 
counseling to recipients. 

Last Friday, President 



Obama directed the Sec- 
retary of State and the 
Administrator of USAID 
to immediately waive 
the former standards of 
these aids, as well as to 
also notify current grant- 
ees that these conditions 
have been waived. 

While this order has 
bas inevitably been met 
ivith discord from many, 
including pro-life groups 
and the Vatican, the in- 
tent of this decision is to 
better family planning 
among other nations. 

"These excessively 
broad conditions on 
grants and assistance 
awards are unwarrant- 
ed," President Obama 
said. "Moreover, they 
have undermined efforts 
to promote safe and ef- 
fective voluntary fam- 
ily planning programs in 
foreign nations."

DEASTRO DESTROYS THE TIGER ROOM: The Tiger Room on 
South Calhoun Street was packed late Sunday to the elec- I 
tfonic and eclectic sounds of Detriot based, Deastro, and I 
local Fort Wayne favorite, Metavari. "That was the best I 
performance that Fort Wayne has ever seen," said Metavari 
Keyboardist, Nate Utesch, as he took the stage. 

Using a table full of synthesizers, Kaoss pads, and drum ma- 
chines to manipulate sound, Deastro combines elements I 
to the likes of The Postal Service if they had babies with I 
The Stokes. Both Deastro {pictured second from left and far I 
right) and Metavari, use complex electronic beats that are I 
powerfully backed by guitars, drums, and keyboards. Meta- I 
vari, who is no stranger to the Fort Wayne music scene, con- I 
sistently provide an unrivaled experience as ambient films 
are projected on the wall behind them, syncronized with I 
their dramatic soundscapes.The band is currently recording | 
a new full length record to release early next year.

The only as-

would like to see change 
is the accessibility of 
grants and studio space 
for artists. "It is difficult to

ist. In art history, we only 
hear success stories, and 
some of those are pretty 
tragic. But for every suc- 
cess, there are legions of 
failed artists. ' 

One of the main rea- 
sons why artists todaymay 
not be successful is due 
to accessibility. Opening 
reception nights need to 
be filled with people from 
the community, as well as 
the media, to publicize 
the event and hype up the 
artist's achievements. The 
main reason why artists 
may not achieve their full 
potential in Fort Wayne 
might have to do with the 
lack of a good downtovm. 
Both Gabbard and Wil- 
liams seemed to think 
that a strong downtown 
scene would provide art- 
ists with more opportuni- 
ties, as well as exposure. 
"I feel that the FortWayne 
scene will improve greatly 
if the city ivill have more 
people living close to the 
downtown area, or we de- 
velop more attractions to 
bring people downtown," 
Gabbaxdsaid. 

Gabbard's suggestion 
may be right on target: 
New York University has 
an exhibit called, "The 
Downtown Show: New 
York Art Scene, 1974- 
1984," which describes 
New York City's success 
with the an scene. One 
part of the exhibit says, 
"Downtown ardsts violat- 
ed the gap between high 
art and mass culture and 
removed the production 
and reception of avant- 
garde art from isolation in 
elite circles." 

That sentence serves 
the purpose to let the rest 
of the world know that 
a thriving downtown is 
essential lo keep artists 
from starving; and also to 
allow art to be seen by ev- 
eryone in the community, 
not just tlie rich and the 
famous.

lery is located on 1832

First Hookah Lounge in Fort Wayne 



By Hana Hawash 



1 full of people both young and old 
smoking from water pipes, blue Christmas lights 
and calm music, usually Bob Marley, adorn a 
' smalliounge called Cloud Nine. 

Cloud Nine is the only hookah lounge in Fort 
Wayne and has one of the biggest collections of 
blown glass pipes in every shape and form. It 
originally staned out as a tobacco and smoke 
accessory shop about three years ago, and the 
lounge was added a year later Next door is a 
coffee shop. The Bean, both owned 
by Ben Rodgers. Both stores are nm 
Wby Ben and his brother, Mike Rodg- 

Smoking hookah at a lounge 

'is still fairly new lo Fort Wayne as 

I recreational activity. Some believe 

I that hookah is less toxic because as the 

" smoke enters the water it is cleansed, but 

the nic- otine is still present making 

Jk the shisha, or flavored to- 

^^^h\ bacco, no safer than ciga- 

^rAreites. 

^S^f ^ hookah can also be 
^ JV^rcalled a water pipe, and it is 
^^set up with burning charcoal 
set atop a metal tray cover- 
ing a bowl of shisha; this 
is all stacked on top of 
what can be described as 
a f;lass vase. 
As you suck through 
the hose attached to the 
\ apparatus, (he heat from 
\ the charcoal is drawn 
\ through the 



shisha causing smoke, or as Mike calls it. "va- 
por gas," lo go through the pipe and come out 
through the hose. Shisha, of which the lounge 
has a large selection, is flavored with honey 
and other natural flavors. Prices vary anywhere 
from $12 to $20, depending on how many hoses 
(up to four) and the brand of shisha. A variety of 
healthy food and beverages from The Bean are 
also served in the lounge at any time for normal 
restaurant prices. 

Though the hookah lounge is small and not 
as elaborately decorated as most other hoo- 



owt 
/ith 



kah lounges, it has its 
fortable old couches

has ^^ visited Cloud Nine and you 

will probably hear them say 
that it is a low key, laid back, re- 
laxing place to hang out. 
Since it is located downtoivn 
on Wells Street, it might seem a little 
shady, but anyone acting inappropriately 
will not be tolerated, and foriegn substanc- 
es including cigarettes are not permitted. 
The doivnside to Cloud Nine is the lack of space 
and theme. Though the room has gone dirough 
some major changes since it was first opened, it 
still has a bit of a way to come until it can beat 
the other lounges. 

Other hookah lounges, cafes or bars tend to 
be themed in the Middle Eastern fashion, with 
low chairs and pillows, traditional decorations 
and Arabic music. 

Since the hookah lounge is still somewhat 
new, it is still undergoing changes. Wade Mur- 
phy, a good friend of the owner, said, "I'm mak- 
ing completely autlientic 'hookah' furniture," 
talking about plans for remodeling the lounge. 
We're moving the wall and expanding [the 
room]." 

Even with the lack of space, Cloud Nine is 
a great hang out with a lot of friendly faces. 
So whether you are in need of some hookah 
or just want to hang out with friends in a laid 
back atmosphere, check out Cloud Nine and 
The Bean located on Wells street just before the 
bridge.

The movies have changed, but some 
things will always stay the same 



In My Day - opEd 

ByWJIUpchurch 

will.upchurch@ipfwco 






In My Day... 

Mel Gibson was only crazy in the 
movies. 

No, reaJly! Jf you haven't seen the 
Lethal Weapon movies then you're 
missing out on some of the finest buddy 
film action the 80's and early 90's have to 
offer. Mel is a crazy loner cop hell-bent 
on self-destruction and Danny Glover 
is a short-timer just looldng forward to 



Glover's Capti 

Murtaugh gave 
us the classic 
line, "I'm getting 
loo old for this 
S#@%.'' I'm not 
exacdy sure 
when Mel went 
off book, but 
back in the 
day he was a 
bankable star and 
made some damn 
fine movies. 

Interestingly, I think 
1996 was both the 
brightest spot and die 
beginning of the end 
for old Mel, when his 
fUm Braveheart won the 
Oscar for Best Film (and 
deservedly so, for it sits 
near the top of my all-time 
greatest films list]. Little did we know 
it was to start a string of anti-British 
historical films, followed up by 2000's 
The Patriot. There were rumors that he 
was shopping an Australian slap at the 
British Empire, but it never went into 
production, denying us the trilogy of 
crazy and causing Mel to descend into 



real madness. 

Let's compare the Top 5 box office 
movies from this month to those in 
the same time period in 1987 when 
the original Lethal Weapon came out. I 
know that as 1 write this Paul Blart: Mall 
Cop has surprised everyone by taking 
the top spot. 

it's a timeless movie, only in that I 
can imagine it having been made in my 
day, except it would have been a buddy 
flick with Pauly Shore and Brendan 
Fraser (who, if you didn't know, took the 
Keanu route of breaking into an action 
career by suffering through years and 
years of buffoonish roles). 

Well, looky there, some things 

change 




is the one people remember the least. 
Truthfully, 1 don't remember much 
about it. Now, The Golden Child on the 
other hand... that's up there with Eddie 
Murphy's finest work 

On the other side of the coin, how 
many of Today's Top 5 do you think 
we'll remember in 20 years? 



Gran Torino tugs on heart strings 




By Said El-Dajani 

contactSipfwcommunicator.org 

Following the life of an old, 
disgruntled, widowed Korean War 
veteran sounds more like a full time 
job than a film. Meet Clint Eastivood's 
recent character. Walt Kowalski. 
Eastwood delivers an encouraging and 
endearing role as a man miserable by 
his surroundings, bystander to a series 
of unfortunate events. Walt just wants 
to be left alone. 

Walt's patronizing sons and their 
demoralized families struggle to 
connect with him, their distance more 
of a cultural gap than a generational 
one. Nick Schenk's story, Gran Torino 
bridges the parallel of crumbling 
American family life to the respectable 
craftsmanship of an American made 
vintage car. 

Walt's almost prepubecent pastor 
tries desperately to reach out to him 
as he finds refuge, ironically, in the 
Hmong, a people of Asian decent. 
Armed with bitterness and racial slurs, 
Walt slowly transitions his views of the 
Hmong that 'htter' his neighborhood. 

The film is strong. Eastwood's 
performance is natural- the defivery 
of his insults genuine, and the guttural 
sounds of an old man, something to 
laugh at. The cast struggles to maintain 
a similar effect, their dialogue, even 
ivith Eastwood, awkward, and off 
timing. 

The tensions created by Eastwood 
are that of an experienced and 
influential director. The film flows like 
a cat chasing a ball of yam. Eastwood's 
hand tugs at the heart strings while 
gentle releases of Watt's efforts allow us 
to make peace with his environment 
and past. Similar is Walt's personal 
battie, as he confronts a Hmong gang 
that compromises the future of his new 
friends.

Brahms and Dvorak: Austrian Gems 



Philharmonic and guest conductor present a variety of classical Austrian pieces 



By Louisa Danielson 

lauLsa.dBnielionSipfwcommunii 




The Guest: Andrew 
Grams guest conducted 
the Fort Wayne Philhar- 
monic Saturday, Jan. 24. 
Phoio Contribultd 

Saturday, Ian. 24 
was a cold night, 
bui the Fon 
Wayne Philharmonic 
was able (o dispel 
some of the chill with 
a terrific rendition of 
peppy Austrian classics, 
orchestrated by Dvorak 
and Brahms. 

The concert opened 
with Dvorak's Hungarian 
Dance no. 21. Although 



the string section 

■r.otg portrayed a 

delicate melody, 

tliere was a hidden 
firmness to iheir tone 
ihar was finally exposed 
ai die flourishing end 
of the piece. Serpentine 
tones wound through 
the Brahms Hungarian 
Dance no. 3. Through 
the rapid-fire tempo 
changes, the orchestra 
was immediately 

sensitive to every signal 
from guest conductor 
Andrew Grams. The final 
Hungarian Dance {no. !, 
orchestrated by Brahms) 
was energetic, the Slavic 
rhythm, pumping the 
music full of sparkling 
tones from the violins, 
the triangle and the brass 
section. 

Nest was the Dvorak 
violin concerto (op. 53), 
played by guest artist 
SooWnKim.Asheentered 
the stage, Kim beamed 
at the audience, bowing 
deeply to their applause. 
Playing the 1709 ex- 
Kempner Stradlvarius, 
Kim's notes sailed over 



the pounding orchestral 
accompaniment, gliding 
through doublestops and 
octaves. The orchestra 
synthesized ivith him 
beautifully, sounding like 
a smooth recording. 

Especially interesting 
was the contrast bet\veen 
the solo violin and the 
accompanying lower 
strings: at one point, Kim 
introduced a passage that 
was immediately copied 
in spritely yet growly 
tones by the cellos and 
bass. Through it all, the 
soloist and conductor 
had great rapport. 
forecasting each pause 
and change in dynamics 
before they occurred. As 
the orchestra sections 
were waiting to come in. 
Grams would look up, 
make direct eye contact 
and smile, as though 
offering the musicians 
a place in the music; 
gradfied tliat they chose 
lo play for him. The end 
oftheconcertocamewitli 
extreme arpeggios by the 
soloist, followed by four 
strong chords that closed 



the work. Kim received 
a standing ovation and 
three bows from the 
cheering audience. 

Following the 

intermission, the 

Philharmonic launched 
into Brahms' Symphony 
no. 3 in F major. The 
opening chords of the 
work were something 
similar to those tones 
of a Tchaikovsky ballet, 
drawn out and very 
dramatic, yet supremely 
graceful. The second 
movement featured a 
placid melody and a 
beautiful pianissimo, 
which the orchestra 
maintained through 
several measures of 
moving notes. The 
fourth movement was 
faster, almost angr^' as 
the strings raced under 
a blaring brass section. 
The piece pulled back, 
melting into French horn 
calls. Gradually, the piece 
slowed and ended. The 
conductor carefully set 
his baton down as the 
audience held its breath 
in the silence, unsure if 



this was the true end of 
the music. 

Then came the 
applause. The conductor 
called up the orchestra, 
secUon by section for 
special recognition. He 
quieUy addressed the 
audience from the backof 
his podium, taking in the 
whole auditorium before 
bowing, then left through 
the back of the orchestra. 
Suddenly, before the 

Getting to know 



applause had ceased. 
Grams ran back on stage. 
Swiping up his baton, he 
launched the orchestra 
into a peppy rendition 
of Brahms' Hungarian 
Dance no. 10. The finale 
was greeted by cheers 
from the audience and a 
great stomping from the 
musicians. Grams turned 
and bowed, taking the 
whole audience in with 
his grin.

Questionable calls plaguing Summit League games 




Photo Monica Gerdeman 



COLLUSION?: The referees at last week's 
games, especially lUPUl, made some poor calls 
and seemed all too friendly with the opponent. 



Variance in men's 
attendance shows 
interest at Gates 

Dane Fife and the mens basketball team spent last 
ThursdayandSaturdayin a familiar, yet very different 
setting. 

The team spends every day practicing in the 
Gales Sports Center on campus, but rarely get the 
opportunity to play games in (he facility until this 
past weekend, due to the circus being in town. 

And it is hard to say that they didn't flourish. 

On Saturday alone, the men pulled in 1,175 
fans for their 4:00 tipoff against lUPUI. For those in 
attendance all day, there was a noticable jump in 
the crowd from the women's 1:30 game. That game 
brought in just 334 fans. 

And while Saturday's turnoufwas nearly 1,800 
fans lower than the average attendance for the team 

this season, it did 

not seem like it due 
to the difference in 
the gyms' sizes. 

The average 
season attendance 
of 2,934 Iprc- 
weekend game;.) 
fills up just 25.5 
percent of ihe 
Coliseum's 11, 500 
available seats. 
On Saturday, 4:1.5 
percent of the 
Gates Center was 
full. Even factoring 
in Thursday's 858 
personattendancc, 
the men's average 
attendance for the 
two games still 
filled up 38 percent 
of the gym, 

"I like playing 
in Gates because 
it has a better 
atmosphere," said 
mens player Zach 
Plackemeier. "I 
can't really think SLAM: Junior Deilvez Yearby 
of any negatives throws down a dunk in 
about playing in Saturday's loss to lUPUI. 
Gates. I think we Yearby's rebounding will be 
should play there important this week in the 
always." Dakotas.

In All Directions - opEd 

By Dan Vance 

vancp-iad.hlogipol.com 

Alter sitting through three games in a three day 
span at the Gates Center, I have just one plea for 
whoever wants to take the lead: hire new referees. 

These games that are being played now are 
crucial for both the men and women from IPFW and 
all of the other schools in the Summit League. The 
conference races are tight, games are important and 
poor officiating from S4 an hour quality referees are 
ruining them. 

On Thursday. Western HIinots mens coach Jim 
Molinari was given a technical for his very vocal 
disagreement on a call that was made poorly. 

Yes, he overreacted. Yes, he got way too physically 
angry and had to be held back by another referee and 
an assistant coach. It was a bit overboard, but maybe 
brought into light Just how bad these referees have 
been lately. 

As for Saturday, 1 wasn't pleased when lUPUI's 
Gary Patterson was nailing threes every time down 
the court in the mens game. But, nobody on the day 
was more lousy than the six referees who presided 
over the two games. 



As someone who has coached basketball, I know 
first hand how easy it is to get irritated when you don't 
think that calls are going your way Chris Paul. Dane 
Fife and the weekend's opposing coaches showed 
that irritation often. 

There were plenty of "tick-tack" fouls, things that 
are loo minor to even take note of. One of those was 
with 14:17 left in the lUPUI game when David Carson 
was called for a foul where virtually no contact was 
made between IPFW's scoring leader and the lUPUI 
player. It was Carson's fourth foul, meaning that the 
Mastodon's biggest scoring threat had to come out of 
the game, in-part hauliing any comeback hope. 

Throw in some no-calls on obvious travels in Ihe 
womens game and plenty of no-calls on fouls in all of 
the games (pretty sure I saw Sarah Haluska virtually 
get beheaded with a clothstine) and you had the 
epitome of poor officiating. 

In parts of each game with lUPUI, the referees 
even seemed like they were more intent on joking 
around and bring buddies with the lUPUl players. If 
that doesn't bring integrity' into question, what will? 

Refs are there to keep things clean and enforce 
rules. TJiey are not there to change the game, either 
in pace or tone. Unfortunady I don't think that any 
of these guys were taught those basics and are quickly 
becoming a plague on the Summit League. 



lUPUl slows IPFW charge 



Chris Paul's Mastodons 
started fast, but couldn't weather 
the offensive storm of lUPUI, 
falling 70-61 on Saturday. 

The loss drops the Mastodons 
to 2-17 with an 11-game losing 
streak that has lasted since 
Decembers. 

IPFW had problems much of 
the game with [aguar post lulia 
Whitted. who did not score much, 
but cluttered the Mastodon 
defense to allow for many wide 
open laguar shots. Four Jaguars 
finished with 10+ points, led by 
17 from BryKeesha Tate, followed 
byIannaEichelberger( 131, Nicole 
James [12) and Brittany Ransom 
(10). Eight total Jaguars scored. 

Wliitted had just four points 
but dominated on the glass with 
-12 rebounds. 

Tina Moen briefly took lUPUI 
out of their game. After keeping 
the Mastodons out of the middle 
and forcing a lot of jumpshots. 
the more athletic Moen started 
shcjuting strong from mid-range ' — 
to slow lUPUIup. 

But that didn't last as iUPUIls 
varied scoring was crucial. The 
Jaguars got many easy baskets 
down the stretch and IPiW just 
couldn't capitalize. 

The Jaguar lead remained in 
double figures until Anne Boese 
hit a three-point basket with 
2:33 to play in the game, cutting 
the deficit to nine. IPFW closed 
to within as few as live at 64-59 
following Jordan Zuppe's second 
three-point basket of the game 
with 37.8 seconds remaining. 
That would be as close as IPFW 
would come, with lUPUl icing 
the game by hitting 6-of-8 free 
throws doivn tlie stretch. 

Boese led IPFW with II points, 
all coming in the second half after 
early foul trouble. 

The Mastodons ended their 
skid Monday with a 55-51 win 
over Western Illinois. Eva Ivanova 
lead with 17 points.

IPFW struggled all day to 
find a way around the size 
of Whitted, who scored 
just four points on 1-of-7 
shooting, but pulled down 1 2 
rebounds.

Young volleyball squad met with 
mixed results on the east coast 



After a week off. ihe mens 
volleyball team returned to action 
over the weekend with a trip to 
visit opponents from the EI\'A. 
The young squad left vvith a split

their defense.

But while George Mason's

defense that let douTi. Sophomore 
Oliver Kook registered the team's 
lone block while the Patriots 
countered with 10.5 of their own. 

After struggling much of the 
first two games, IPFW played 
strongest in the third. The

From Page 12 



The tide turned on Saturday 
as lUPUI came out with a flurry, 
starting th game on a 10-0 run that 
included two big three-pointers 
from Gary Patterson and a huge 
dunk from Robert Glenn. 

The Mastodons had little to 
ansiver, especially early. Patterson 
hit on four of his first five from 
deep and ended the first half with 
18 points. 

IPFW countered with a slow 
start that included uvo first half 
points from leading-scorer Carson 
and none from Daniels. 

"I'm not sure I was surprised 
on how they came out, more of 
how we responded to it," Johnson 
noted, "We never got that one 
stop we needed to get back in the 
game. Patterson is a good player 
and Glenn is an athlete so we had 
to make some adjustments and by 
the time we did it was a litde too 
late." 

The Mastodons played well, 
only being edged out 35-32 in 
Ihe 20-minute period. But they 
never climbed back into the 
game. Plackemeier hit from deep 
well, going 3-for-3 from deep and 
Daniels scored 10 second half 
points but it was not enough. 

Patterson and Glenn ended 
with 20 points each. 

The attention now shifts to a 
big weekened trip to the Dakotas. 

"lA win overl NDSU (North 
Dakota State) would be huge 
because they are at the lop of our 
league and that would really send 
a message to the league and our 
team that we can play with anyone.

Johnson added, while also nothing 
the value of teamwork. "We also 
have to stick together and not 
think diat one individual can do 
what we nee done for diis team," 

Plackemeier agrees and says 
that understanding these things 
are most important. 

"I don't think there is one team 
(in the conference) that we can't

Split keeps IPFW on the edge of the Summit 



By Dan Vance 

dan.vanceSipfwtomniunicatoiDrg 

As the days of lanuary come to a 
clase, each game within the Summit 

League isbecomingmorecrucial for the 
10 teams that comprise the conference. 
Most crucial because of those 10, just 
eight will make March's conference 
tournament. 

IPFVV got a taste of the ups and 
downs of the crucial games with a 
decisive win over Western Illinois last 
Thursday (80-71), before being bJoivn 
QUI by the visiting laguars of lUPUI 
on Saturday (84-57). Both games were 



uncharacteristically played in the Gates 
Sports Center with the circus in town at 
the Memorial Coliseum. The change of 
venue was met with open arms. 

"Gates is a really good place to play 
at," senior lakari lohnson said. "I think 
that the crowd can really get into the 
game." 

The Leathernecks ofWestem Illinois 
came out fighting, exchanging early 
three-pointers with IPFW to take a three- 
point lead on t^vo seperale occassions 
within the first two minutes. 

"Western set a lot of ball screens in 
the first half. At halftime, we said we 
were going to switch all ball screens 
and they really struggled scoring from 



then out," sophomore guard Zach 
Plackemeier said. 

Defense was a huge key in the 
second half of the game, sparked in part 
by the play of senior Jakari Johnson, 
who has seen his production slowly 
go up after missing the beginning 
of the season with an injury. At one 
point early on, Johnson ran down a 
ball in the backcourt and knocked it 
off a Leatherneck player just as the 
tivo were rumbling out of bounds. The 
momentum that gave IPFW was key in 
a t3-point IPFW swing. 

"I'm not sure if it's me ihats the 
important part," Johnson said. "But 
I think defense is very important, you 



can't win a game without stopping 
someone. I really just take pride in it 
and try to give the player I am guarding 
a little to think about." 

The run. also including an untimely 
technical foul against the Western 
ILinois coach gave the Mastodons a 
crucial cushion to work with. The lead 
grew to as many as 12 points with three 
minutes to play. 

David Carson andBenBottsled IPFW 
with 23 and 20 points respectively. Nick 
Daniels added 13 and Plackemeier had 
10, with three steals, sb( assists and no 
turnovers. IPFW had just 14 rebounds.
