IPFW police discuss 
Gates incident 

The April 12 incident at Milliard 
Gates Sports Center likely was nol gun- 
tire, police believe. A person at Ihe con- 
test told an IPFW police officer Ihcy 
thoughl they heard gunshols or fire- 
works aller the Fori Wayne All-Slar SPam 
Dunk and 3-Poinl Shnol Out that nighl. 

"I can'l confirm 100 percenl. Bui il 
■here had been gunshols in the crowd 
oulside, someone would have seen some- 
Ihing. Nobody knew anything. Nobody 
saw anylhing," said IPFW Folic 
Safety Chief Lauren D. Denhartog, 

Denharlog said it is nnl unco 
for the police to receive a report ol a gun- 
shot, but reality finds Ihe noise is usually 
Irom a car backfiring or a firecracker. The 
chief said esltii uniU from Fort Wayne 
and Allen County were called for assis- 
tance in encouraging Ihe several hundrtd 
leenagcts to leave Ihe campus al about 9 
p.m, A total of 12 unlls arrived from 
FWPD and Allen County, 

"Rather than having ttvo officers trj' 
to handle il, Ihey called for back-up, 
wluch was the righl call. There were no 
anesis," DeiOiartog said. He said nobody 
was detained In his knowledRp

IPFW Financial Aid is seeking 
input from students to help establish 
Ihe adjustment for cost of living during 
Ihe 2003-2004 school year 

The Cost of Living buney is avail- 
able through the Rnancial Aid Office in 
Kelller Hall (Koom 102BI It has also 
been handed out to siime students on 
campus, as well as being included in 
some iPBV mass mailings 

The 22-i}uustion form will help 
campus decision makers be more spe- 
cific when they go before the budget 
committee, Assoaate Director of 
Financial Aid loel Wenger eiplained 
that he hupes students Fill the form out 
through this week. Thev plan lo have 
the results by early Nlay. After Ihat, 
more information ivill be coming 
throughout the summer, he said. 

'^e'te obviously ivailing for the 
slate to fmali/e their budget, and then 
we get our budgets finahztd. When we 



ioing lo b? is when we'll work 1 
imajlzing ouf budget,' Wenger said. 

The survey looks beyond many 
casual factors of other questioruiaires 
jind asks about costs students incur, 
including monthly estpei^ses (or the fol- 
lowing: 

• long distance phone calls 

• titililies 

• clothing 

• health ins 

■ health and dental expenses 

• groceries and meals 

• books, supplies, photocopying 

■ other education maleriaLs 



• personal ilems. 

Students are asked lo estimate all 
costs, including those for laundry and 
toothpaste. 

IPFW originally surveyed some 
area apartment complexes and student 
bookstores, but decided to become 
more focused lo see what students are 
reallv paving during Ihe school year 
c trying to get a little n 



accurate. Just doing cost of living 
inaeases e^ery year dixsr't lieccssarily 
reflect an accurate picture of what our 
studenb are rvally paying for their off- 
campus activitie*^ and eipen.^ies." 
Wenger explained. This will help IPFW 
and the students. Wenger added The 
Financial Aid office is trying to be 

K (active and have answers for the 
rdue University board before they 
approach them vrith budget requesLs. " 
'We're ming to get a little more 
consistent with how tve comprise the 
numbers, be it from a sun-ey or some 
olher kind of national average." he 

Some of the questiorw also deal 
ivilh the expanding radius from where 
IPFW students live. They do nol just 
commute from Allen County anymore. 
Wenger explained. Instead of using a 
30-mile round trip calculation, they 
want to determine ivhal the average is 
for students who commute There are 
also other situation.s the oFFice wants to 
address including students who ,ire still 
living with their parents or living im

SOAR guides Incoming students

Eifi/or 

With the tall term just around the 
comer, Lori Beth Royse and her learn oF 
18 students are preparing for a summer 
of Student Orientation and Registration 
(SOAR) — a program Ihat introduces 
incoming freshmen lo IPRV. 

SOAR is seen as a leadership role 
on campus, and each year staff and fac- 
ulty nominate students they feel are 
outstanding examples oF what IPFW 
should be. After nominations, s hid en Is 
go through individual and group inter- 
vie(vs until Ihe SOAR group is nar- 
roived to IS 



'ih.iiml- r.i. 1- -pplv. so I completed the 
applm.ituin .ind look il lo the Student 
Lite Office, Then they set up an initial 
interview. Everyone goes through a 
group and individual interview 
process. Then a week or so later, I 
received a letter in the mall inviting me 
lo be an orientation assistant," Melissa 
Rentfroiv explained. 

This year. Ihe staff is going 
through rigorous training. Students aie 
requia-d lo attend four nights of training 
which are three hours long. 

"Now we are all in staif develop- 
ment training which includes interper- 
sonal skills, leadership skills and IPFW- 
specific training that we need lo know- 



to help the students and parents get 
acquainted with IPFW and college RFe 
in general," Rentfroiv said. 

The SOAR o Ken la lion group con- 
sists of t%vo orientation leaders, Laura 
O'Shaughnessy and Adrieitne 
Swinfoid, and 16 orientation assistants: 
Chinwe Aneke, Amanda Becker, lill 
Biretey, Ross Blaellner, Kelly BrachI, 
Linn Clegg. Chelcey Kirkpatrick, Amy 
Knippel, Samantha Lauer, Alyson 
Lindholm, Cliff Loulhan, Cher Packard, 
Michael Shorter, Jill Stimpson, Jon 
Symington and Ren If row, 

Tne orientation group will have a 
total of 15 SOAR sessions during which 
they will be giving campus tours, sel- 
ling up for break-out sessions such as 
"Finding A Major That Fits" and "Col 
Spirit," and introducing students lo 
their academic advisers. "SOAR helps 
fill the relatioiuhips between students 
and their academic advisers," Royse 
said. 

The one difference between 
this summer's SOAR and those of 

fiS9t years, is that Ilie incoming 
rcshmen will automatically havo 
academic holds placed on their 
records. Because of the holds, 
incoming freshmen will not be able 
to register for their classes until 
they have either attended SOAR or 
have waited until the last day of 
SOAR is compleled- 

"(Studentsi have lo make 
connections and [they] can do that 
at SOAR," Royse said.

After Sept. II. we heard a lot about Islamic or 
Mu.slim extrcmisls. The concept of exta-mism and 
religion is not a new one. It is as old as religion. In 
Chnslianity it was coined fundamentalism, but ele- 
ments of fundamentalism run through branches and 
sects of all religions, many philosophies and many 
organizations. Fundamentalism refers lo the adher- 
ence to literal interpretations of holy writings such as 
the Old or Neiv Testaments of Ihe Kbie. the Koran or 
Ihe Kabala. II is also Ihe belief that there is only one 
way lo truth, and it is the fundamentalist's way. 

Actually, some Christian fundamentalists 
would probably want you to believe Ihat they are the 
orUy true fundamentalists, ll is a way of thinking that 
is so black and white that all shades of gray are not 
only wrong, but bad. It is a system of belief Ihat, 
when taken to its exlrcme, gives rise to bigotry, 
hatred, violence and murder, m my search through 
life 1 have found that there are fundamenlalisU in all

our troops, Ihe Iraqi population 
taking up arms against us and a 
war that would lake months to 
end have all been proven "incor- 
rect. Still, even after the war. 
Garofalo continues the verbal 
assault on our president and his 
administration, 

ABC has "delayed indefi- 
nitely" Ihe premiere of 
Garofalo's new series due lo 
countless calls and E-mails 
voicing displeasure with her 
vievvs. Sponsors and advertisers 
are nol going Id support a show

Martin Sheen is suffering a 
fate similar lo Garofalo's. In 
fact, I could almost say he has 
gone from "Mr. Nol in Our 
Name" lo "Mr, Not on Our TV 
Scl" in a few short weeks. 
Ratings (or "ITie \^5t Wing" 
have dropped sharply in the 
past few monlhs^I can't say for 
sure if this is due to Sheen's 
poLtical views, or jusi the view- 
ing public being sick of seeing a 
DSnocralic president in office 
(even if il is just a TV show), bul 
once again. Ihe public is mak- 
ing their distaste ivilh Sheen 
very appaicni. 

Moore is a different cat 

altogether. This man truly has 

reality. His public 

liave become so far 

h.il even the liberals 

I are starting to avoid 



America is 
finally being 
heard and 
m Its I of Ihem 
are opposed 
(if not outright disgusted) at the 
views of liberal loudmouths 
like Moore and Carofalo. The 
simple truth is this: Americans 
do not want to financially sup- 
port celebrities who do nol 
share their views 

While these celebrities 
have every right to say whatever 



By alienating them- 
selves from 75 percent of the 
people tvho see mcnies. buy 
ITDs and go to concerts, they 
should have seen this coming. 

The Conslilutian pn&gt;tccts 
your right lo say whatei'cr you 
want; it does not protect you 
from Ihe consequences of say- 
ing things that make you look 
like a dumbass. Let me illus- 
trate this ivilh the foUosving 
example: Freedom of speech 
gives a man the right to say to 
his wife. "Honey, you look 
awfully fat in- tlial dress." 
Common sense should tell him 
tlial he has nobody but himself 
lo blame when he gets cut off 
for the next month. 

M)^ point: even free 
speech isn 1 "free." There ivill 
altvays be consequences lo 
whal you say Come on celebs, 
get with the program. You had 
enough conviction to make 
your statements, noiv please be 
courteous enough lo ^UT UP 
so I can ivatch your careers fade 
aivaj' in peace and quid. 







fundamenlalists — 
there was only one 
way to sobriety and 11 
was their way. 

Why, in a nation 
ruled by extremisls, 
are we surprised by 
extreme actions? The 
suicide bombers 
believed they were 
righl. Their belief 

1 strong Ihat 

ere willing to 

il. They were not only willing to die, they 
were willing lo kill Ihousands of civilians for their 
cause. It was, after all. a holy cause. 

I have heard President Bush refer lo his role as a 
Christian leader as juslification for liberating the 
Afghanis and the Iraqis. He believes so strongly that 
he is ivilling to let young men and women die (or his 
cause, and he is willing lo kill many civilians in Ihe 
process, all lo rid the »vorld of Ihe "axis of evil," a 
term our president coined. 

Whal people do in God's name doesn't amaze 
me anymore. What does amaze me is the fact that 
other, often intelligent, people are still so easily led 
into fundamentalist rhetoric. Fundamental means 
the core meaning. The foundation of the belief. It is 
the leading principle that serves as the groundwork 
of a system. 1 believe that any system can be corrupted. 
If there is a single principle that I have found among 
all faiths, a single truth that all great teachers taught, 
it is love. Pure and simple. From love springs com- 
passion and selfless acts. 

Early Christians didn't beliex-c in the literal 
translation of ihe Bihl£._Nol even the. lews, (rom- 
whom early Chrislianily developed, bclu'ved in a lit- 
eral in terp relation of the Old Toslament The early 
Christians actually believed that Ihe Old Testament 
was part of Ihe old wisdom that ushered in the truth 
of Christ, This old wisdom was not only based on Ihe 
Old Testament but also on Greek mythology and 
scholarly wisdom such as Ihe leachings of Plato and 
Socrates. 

So if Ihc foundation of Christianity is based on 
Christ and his teachings, why have so many been 
killed in the name of Christ? Christ didn't kill any- 
one. He taught love and compassion lo Ihe point of 
total self sacrifice. 

El is human nature lo distort the truth. It takes 
no lime at all lo forget the foundation upon which a 



belief or a mission is built. That is one of Ihc n-asons 
why organiiatioiu create a mission statement — so 
Ihey don't forget why they cost. So they don't lose 
Iheir way. In America, our mLssion slalemcnl 
includes Ihe Declaration of Independence. Ihe 
Constitution ol the United Slates and the Bill of Rights. 
The Declaration of Independence slates Ihat. 
-WE hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men 
(1 would add women) are civaled equal, that they arc 
endowed by their Creator with certain in.iheriable 
Rights, that among these arv Life. Lil&gt;erli,- and Ihe 
Pursuit of Happiness." This declaration di&gt;e&gt;not say 
Ihat all Amcncans should haie Ihest' rights. II says 
all people are cnMled fqii,il .ind endoived by theit 
crealor o( these n eh i.-i II thi- 1&gt; Ihe lund.imentfll core 
o( America, why do ivf livl •«&gt; inv whfn it comes to 
stripping others of life, litu'riv .in.l their mvn indi- 
vidualized pursuit of h.ippines.-? 

The new fundamentalLsl palhnis want us to 
believe Ihat our voices should be silenced in suppiirt 
even when we feel that (undamcnial injustices 01* 
being committed. They want us lo believe that patri- 
otism is supporhng a government thai corrupts Ihe 
foundalional concepts of America. Theodore 
Roosevelt, the 26th pn.-sident. said, "To announce 
thai there must bv no 
criticism of the 
presidoni, or thai we 
are to stand by the 
president, right or 
wrong, is nol only 
unpalriolic and 
MTiilc, but is morally 



nable

American people? Do Ihe ma|ori(\ .1 \rin n, m ■ 1. .il- 
ly believe m Ihe "aiis of evil," or Ihat il is Ihe rolv of 
a Christian America lo wipe out the 
"evil do-ers?" Are we even a Chrislian America? 
How many Americans are Christian? What denomi- 
nations are Ihey? Of those that are Christian, how 
many are Catholic? We know Ihat the leader o( the 
Catholic Church, Ihe Pope, doesn't believe in this 
war. Do all Ihe non-Cauiolic Christians support a 
war to wipe out evil? What about Ihe Arab- 
Americans or Ihe Jewish -Americans or the Muslim- 
Americans? What about Ihe Pagans? The list could 
go on and on. 

Do wc want a fundamentalist America? I 
learned a long lime ago lo run from orthodoxy and 
JundamentalJEm. In the '70s. Ihc peace movement 
began with good inlentions, yel il ended as a group 
ol diverse people, some ol whom were committing 
acLs of violence and spewing hale and rhetoric. The 
foundation of Ihe peace movemeni is peace, yet 
peace can easily gel lost in all the emotion, fruslni- 
lion. anger and confusion.

Have you had enough of reality t.v? 



Il'i out of hand. Rcaljly lelevision 
has nin iLs course in many aspects. 
Who wauls to wdtch another edition of 
"Survivor"? Aren't they running out of 

But the main beef with reality 
television these days is not that they 
have gone on loo long, but that they 
look more and more like Jerry Springer 
every day. 

For instance, the eleventh season 
of "Road Rules" (Us Vroas) that recendy 
wrapped up ivas the first without the 
stereotypical homosexual and bad boy. 
And damn, wasn't It more real thaii 
any other reality television ever? 

Other than the fact that nearlv 
everyone ended up having sen with 
everyone else, it was pretty normal. 
And they all achjalW got along, lo the 
extent that some of them live together. 

But if you look through most reality 
television stiows, especially MTV staples 
"Road Rules" and "Real World, '-^ all 
you sec is ivhiny women. 

With the exception of New 
Orleans' Julie Stoffer, who spent her 
days shunning her parents' mindset 
and Mormon faith. 'Ileal World" has 
been a menacing place for males. Can 
there be a season without the drama 
queen? Even on the recent Vegas 
season, Brynn Smith attacked room- 
mate Steven wielding a fork. 

And who is tired of the endless 
reality hookups? Every season has its 



Velocity" or Rachel Campos Inow 
Duffy) of "RW San Francisco and Sean 
Duffy of "RW Boston"). 

And who knows more about feuds 
and brawls than the casts of reality tel- 
evision shows? The attack of chi- 
huahua-loving Abe Ingersoll by cast 
mate Gladys Saixabria ftx)m "RR Lahn 
America" mav be one of the more vio- 
lent attacks, but it was the actions of 
David Edwards on "RW Los Angeles" 
that were most infamous, such as his 
attempt lo pull covers off a nude cast- 
But not all reality television cast 
members are bad. and that's what I am 
here lo get across. A great deal of reality 
fans are bred of the typecasting due to 
the fact that most homosexual cas 
members are made to look like the bad 
guys. But thankfully, |im Verraros of 
"American Idol" and Shane Greyson of 
"Road Rules Campus Crawl have 
eliminated most of the stereotypes. 

And when the shadows clear of all 
ol the reality shows and their spinoffs, 
six men will remain. The baddcsl 
collection of reality players ever. The 
starting six, if you will. 

Starting out, of course, would be 
the o rig inaf "Reality Bad Boy." David 
Puck, i^own more as the latter was bad 
before bad was good. Fuck promptly 
dissed and dismissed every member of 
his "RW San Francisco" cast mates.

Next, you have Mark Long, from 
the original "Road Rulc^' l-ong has

viding one of the firit realitj- hook-ups

ing the "RW/RR Ballleof the Seasons," 

Will Kirtiy would make an e.icel- 
lenl addition to the group. The tvinner 
of "BicBrDther 2" was just too evil to 
hale. The doctor's escapades even 
included claimmg a marijuana smoking 
expedition with pop group 'N Sync. 

Rob Zbacnilc malces a good addi- 
tion Id the all-star cast for two reasons. 
One, because I think he was present at 
this Kirby/'N Sync "smoke off," and 
I1V0. because he brings a calm to the 
reality stonn.

Tou^ Enough" produced a great m 
its second season. Hawk Younkins 
would make a good addition becaute 
he made cast males frightened of him 
and all of his other personalities. 

And with all the "American Idnl" 
goody-goodies, one slands out. I'm not 
talking about the sister-beating Corey 
Clark. I'm talking about the quiel, yel 
still hardcore marine Joshua Gracin
