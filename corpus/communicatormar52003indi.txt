Ehrenreich spoke out regarding poverty, living poor 



She ihoiighl il was a good idea. Havc^ a

worker, and then write about Ihc experience of 
living after welfare reform through old- 
fashioned journalism. Siic lold the editor of 
Harper's magazine Ihat idea white they ale lunch. 
He thought il was a good idea a.^ well. 

'It started as a magazine as.'^ignment." 
Barbara Ehrenreich said about hur novel "Nickel 
And Dime," 1o see if I could live on Ihc wages I 
could make as an entry level worker. I had to leave 
home, find the cheapest accommodations I could 
and the besi paying jobs I could find." 
"Employment away from political essayist," she 

Ehrenreich is an award-winning writer of 14 
boots and numerous articles for magazines, 
including Ms,, Harpers, New York Times 
Magazine and Tune, (or which she has wrilten 
since 1990. She was IPFW's fourth Omnibus 
Lecture Series speaker for the school year on 
Thursdav at VValb Student Union, diseussine her 
book "Nickel And Dimcd." The book looks at 
America's welfare reform which began in 1996. "l 
find welfare reform pretty foscinaling and also 
infuriating," she said, "ft really ended poor single 
mother enlitlemenis to any kind of cash support." 

She look the assignment to three different 
cities over three months and ended up working 



live |obs. Ehrenreich worked as a waitress, hotel 
housekeeper, a housecleaning maid, a nursing 
home maid and a Wal-Mart associate. There are 
no employees of Wal-MarJ," she noted. "You go 
for a job today, no matter what Ihe job is. you^c 
not called an employee. You're a team-member. 
You're an associate. You gel the idea that you're 
going to be sittingdown with Ihe boand of direc- 
tors over lunch," Ehrenreich joked. 

President Bush calls the reforms a success, 
but Ehrenreich debates that. "1 don't think 
changes are going Id come on the federal level in 
the neKl year or tivo. What would the Bush admin- 
istration do with poverty if they focused on it for a 
minute? Bomb it?" she asked. She calls Ihe 
nation's official poverty level "mcaninglessness." 
The poverty level (or one person is S9,000 a year. 
She was making about SI4,00D, but struggling. 
Officially, Ihe federal goverrunenl recognizes 12 
percent of America as poor. She said thsi k liatpil 
on a formula 40 years old and several 
bumps in inflation. 

Ehrenreich points to a percentage estimated 
by the Economic Policy Inslitule. In 2001, they 
eslimaled 29 percent of^ Americans with childr- 



wellare married them, the women would haiu 
financial security. "Not all of IhoseCEOs arc eiactk 
marriage material," Ehrenreich quipped. 

She doesn't like Ihe idea of government 
pushing marriage- Nolonly does it seem to her to 
be none of the government's business, but wont 
likely lessen the plight o( the poor, she said "Most 
women marry men of their own social cI.tss. II 
you're a very poor single mom. you're probably 
looking (or a blue&gt;eollar man. I( there's any group 
whose wages have really gone down in the last 20 
years, it's blue-collar men," she explained. 
Ehrenreich joked thai she did Ihe calculations (or a 
woman to live comtortably. and she'd have to 
marry more than tivo men — currently illegal. 

She also rails agairut drug testing, calling it a 
"ritual of humiliation" to prepare people for their 
job. She pointed out persorulily tests which she 
coruiders silly in their scope. What surprised 
Ehrenreich about Ihe cKpericnce wasn't the phvsi- 
call)r hard work. It was Ihe amount of tedious, 
brain-straining drudgery. This is a humbling 
thing to admit because I have a Ph.D. I've written

Educational excursions to Europe 

Students offered several summer opportunities 



See the world and earn college 
credits. College is often a time when 
people have an opportunity to study 
abroad. Those students who have been 
hoping to travel Ihe globe will have 
several opportunities presented to 
them this summer, IPiW's Division of 
Continuing Studies is offering two 
chances for students and community 
members to study in either Paris and 
Mediterranean Europe or Rome. 

The trips will also offer optional 
credit in FINA H390 or ARET 210. 
ARET 210 Architecture and Urban 
Form fulfills three credit hours 
towards IPFW's General Education 
Area IV requirement. The cost for Paris 
and Mediterranean Europe will be 
S2,333-S3,018 depending on the 



Siena and Pompeii. 

"It's always more enriching when 
you can actually stand in front of the 
object and people can actually sec 
them themselves." said 5a ma nt ha 
Birk, a coordinator for Ihe Paris trip. 
Travelers to Rome will visit the 
Pantheon, the Colosseum, Bernini's 
David in the Borghese Galleries, 
Mkhclangelo^s Sistinc Oupcl and ol)\en. 

"This is an educational adventure 
unlike anything else in a college career 
because it is amiost entirely experien- 
tial learning," said Malt Kubik. another 
Paris trip coordinator. "You caruiot 
compare reading or listening to a lec- 
ture about art, design or historv lo 
actually standing in the middle ot the 
Colosseum. Students return with a 
much broader utiderstanding of the

IPFW's DeMott receives NSF research grant 



Another of IPf^V's professors 
has received national recognition. 
This lime, there is a cash atvard 
involved. Recently. IPFW biology 
professor William R. DeMott 
received a grant for nearly 
$220,000 from Ihe National 
Science Foundation. 

The National Science 
Foundation accounts for about 
20 percent of federal funding for 
academic institutions in the 
United States.The grant will be 
used to study Ihe ecology of 
food chains in lakes and examine 
12 varieties of daphnia, "Our 

Erevious ivork on zoo plankton 
3d exciting results which 
directed us towards this neiw 
research." DeMott said. 

Daphnia are microscopic 
s that have proven to 



be a crucial link bctiveen algae 
and fish in the food chain in 
lakes around the world. The 
research will consist of the 
daphnia being fed both natural 
and cultured algae that differ in 
digestion resistance. They will 
measure such physiological 
reactions as growth, assimila- 
tion, feeding rate and others. 

"IPF\V students will be 
working with me all three years 
both in Michigan and on cam- 
pus," DeMotI said. During each 
summer, DeMott will employ a 
team of IPFW students to 
participate in field and laboratory 
studies at Michigan State 
University's Kellogg Biological 
Station. 

"During Ihe third summer, 
we will use pl.istic enclosures 
approximately three meters in 
diameter and two meters deep 
and fill them with diflerenl 



species of daphnia. If our 
hypothesis is correct, daphnia 
species will differ in ability lo 
grow on algae," DeMotI 
explamed, "and in their impact 
on the algal composition." 

IPFW students from 
DeMott's previous National 
Science Foundation project have 
gone on to give talks al the 
American Sociely of Linuiology 
and Oceanography meetings 
and tvill be co-aulhors of scien- 
tific articles. 

Bryn Pape, who spoke at 
the Albuquerque, N.M. Aquatic 
Sciences meeting in 2001, is now

ogy senior Jermy Edington

From the Right: The truth about Taxes 



The monlh of March signals Ihc beginning of 
lit season for many Americans. While many of us 
who an? expecting a Ian refund have filed lax 
rclums early. Ihere Is a large pari of Ihe populalion 
who will VJ3\\ until Ihe last minute to file — either 
to avoid paying additional taxes until the lost 
minute or (more commonly) to avoid having to 
tackle the complicated forms and mathematical 
calculalicms required to complete a return. I knoiv 
several people who, even on Ihc standard short 
form, would rather pay a tax preparer close to 
SIOO to process their return, just so they don'l have 
1o do it Ihemsolvc*. 

This was my firsi year filing taxes as a married 
man. Considering Ihe additional complications of 
college credits, studeni loan interest. 40IK 
roll-overs and oilier financial Iransjclions that had 
taken place in my family this year. I also chose to 
have 3 tax preparer do my rehim. (AInght, 1 really 
wanted to do them myself, but my wife forced, „ 
er, convinced mc to have a preparer do them for 
us.) 

The amount ol our refund absolulcly caughl 
me by surprise, and it got mc to thinking — about 
the president's proposed tax cut. The thing that 
bothers mc most about this subicci is Ihc repeated 
suggestion that the lax cut will shift the tax burden 



The o 

bespun and presented to support cithcrside of thi 
argument, but 1 want to look at reality here. Tht- 
truth of this situation is that most lower income 
citizens pay little or no income tax at all, and the 
middle class "average American" pays a much 
lower percentage of tficir income in taxes than do 
Ihc wealthy. 

When vou remove the group labels ,ind lonk 



at the individual taxpayers, the reality is that a 
wealthy person will pay two or three times (on a 
percentage of total income) the taxes that an 
"average" taxpayer is required to pay. In total 
dollars paid, the difference is even larger. 

What opponents of the lax cut are banking on 
is that Americans will not (or just plain can't) 
understand that by using the classic litieral ploy of 
assignuig everyone to a group, then using this 
group to examine a policy, the individual is 
removed from the equation. While the poor and 
middle class "'groups" may pay more total taies 
than the wcallTiy "group." the often overlooked 
fact is that the wealthy are a small minority in this 
country. 

Why don't we look al things on a smaller 
scale in the form of three theoretical taxpayine 
families of lour (two adults and two children)? 
For the sake of argument, we will set their gross 
income levels at S5OO,0O0 a year for Ihe "wealthy" 
family; 575,000 a year for the "middle-class" family 
and S29.00O a year for the lower income family. 
When wc look at how each of these imaginary 
families pays their taxes, Ihe truth becomes clear. 

The wealthy family would obviously pay 
more taxes (around 5150,000) than Ihe middle 
class family (55,000) would pay. The lower income 
family, with earned income credit, exemptions and 
deductions will gel back more than they paid in 
taxes to begin with (1 know this appears crazy, but 
1 know a few people who get back a retum fargcr 
than what they actually paid in.) Now, before all 
you accounting and economics majors write in 
criticizing my figures. I will admit that 1 estimated 
these numbers, 1 wanted to show that a low and 
middle-income family, as individual units, don't 
have it so bad, but I didn't want to spend hours 



immediately prolesled, claiming thai 

the majority of that tax cut would go 

the wealthiest of Americans and do 

little to help the lower and middlecla?? 

citizens- In truth, the tax cut would 

help all of them, Wnile the toial dollar 

amount of decrease would be larger for 

the wealthy family, they would still 

pay a hieher percentage of total 

income and a higher dollar amount of 

taxes. The middle class family would 

get to keep more of their money, and 

Ihe lower income family would get to keep even 

more of the money they didn't pay in the first 

sure all of you could use on additional S500 per 
year in your pocket to spend however you so 
choose. 1 figured my taxes again coruidenng the 
proposed tax cut. and discovered that my return 
would have been S625 larger. 1 don't know about 
most middle-class families, but this middle-class 
American isn't going to sneeze at S600 and say it 
isn't going to help anyone. 

It aba leads into another concept that has 
been getting way too much play lately — the idea 
that the tax burden is being shifted to the lower 
income ciliMns. This is one of the mon? outra- 
geous scare tactics the left has ever used, and it is 
■ NOT TRUE. If you ha&gt; 




I urge vou all to look at tlus from a personal 
level. Co to hltp://moneycentral.msn.com/arli- 
c les /common/ bush tax.asp and you can see tuhat 
the president's tax cut will mean lo you as an 
individual. Keep in mind that Ihe column for 2010 
is what the president want to enact NOW. Once 
you sec how much money the tax cut will put back 
in your personal bank account, make the decision 
for yourself — are you going to give in lo Ihe class 
warfare rhetoric of the Democrats who don't »vant 
you to keep more of your money, or arc you going . 
to be an individual and support a much needed 
tax break being offered to all Americans? 

On a personal note: by the lime I write my 
nexl column we may well be at war with Iraq, For 
lany who may disagree with using military 



the many who may disagree with usmg mihtarv 

force against Iraq, I would ask a tavor. Protest all 

you want agairut the president, the administration

Letter to the Editor: Nuclear Weapons 



The 



ilifer 



discussed at Ihe Canberra 
Commission for the Elimination 
of Nuclear Weapons, founded 
by the Australian Government 
after the end of Ihe Cold War. 
Many influential international 
men and women worked on Ihe 
Commission, and all came to the 
same conclusion. In order to 
preserve our society, all nuclear 
weapons must be destroyed. 
But here we sit. walling and 
watching what our president 
will do next in what seems like a 
race lo deslruct one another. The 

millennium has lo be.sweapons 
of mass destruction," bccaiise 
everywhere you turn, (he phrase 
is gushing from people """ 



Hov 



; gotten 



than 20 years, from eli 
ing weapons of mass destruc- 
tion to using them on each 
other? I would say it is because 
we have ignored t'he findings of 
Canberra and we have not 
combated effectively the 
proliferation of such weapons. 

The Commission recognized 



type 



of p 



lifera 



horii!ontal and vertical. Vertical 
prohlcration of weapons addnsses 
Ihe arms race that develops 
between countries thai have 
established nuclear programs. 
These would include the United 
Slates, Britain, France and other 
major world contributors. These 
counlrics have similar resources 
lo develop arms programs and 
begm to outdo the others. This 
leads to tcclmology increasing 
itself much too quickly, and 
leaves us ivilh dangerous weapons 
we know nothing about. 

These weapons have senous 
long-term consequences, and no 
one IS speaking up about that. 



As long as one ol Ihe 'super 
powers has nuclear weapons, 
the others will strive to top it. 
The reason Saddam Hussein has 
nuclear weapons stashed some- 
where, if he does, is because he 
is afraid that the United States 
or other super-powers will wage 
war on him and he will be left 
standing in Ihe dust. Isn't that 
the reason every country has 
nuclear weapons? Is Ihere some 
other use for them that I am 
missing? 

The second type of 
proliferation is Ihe horizontally. 
This includes the spreading of 
Weapons &lt;o countries that do 
not already have Ihem. Tlus is Ivts 
the potential lo start smaller arms 
races within geographically 
close countries. Once a smaller 
country develops a weapon, 
hungry for power, they may try 
lo overtake others. So the others 
begin to develop theii own 
weapons. The combination of all 
of the weapons in all of the 
upslartins countries could one 
day rival one of those of the 
superpowers. 

Trie Commission also found 
that both types of proliferation 
are linked. Tliere can be not vertical 
proliferation without first having 

engage in horizontal prolifera- 
tion, they will ultimatelv move 
up the ladder to vertical prolif' 
eration. You can not have one 
without having the other. As 
long as one country has 
weapons. Ihere is Ihe threat of 
both horizontal and vertical 
proliferation. The Commission's 
recommendation- eliminate all 
nuclear weaporu. 

Why didn't we listen to 
them? You would think some of 
our govemmental ofhcials were 
privy to the Commission's 



findings, why haven't they used 
it? So, wc ate led wondering if 
war looms in Ihc distance, as it 
most certainly docs. If we would 
have followed Ihe Commission's 
findings years ago. we may not 
be in this predicament now. But 
il is always better late than 
never. We need to take a cue 
from the past and speak out 
about nuclear weapons. Why 
should Saddam have to give his 
weapons up if the United States 
and all of their allies arc being 
allowed to keep theirs? I'd tell 
Bush to practice what he preaches 
and disarm his government. We 
are Ihe United Slates of America, 
the example for others to follow, 
or SO wc say. Why are we twing 
hypocrites now? 

t know thai we are in a time 
of war and people are backing 
the president in order to show 
they are patriotic. Now is not the 
time I o be blinded by patriotism. 
Stand up and oppose the war 
and the 'weapons of mass 
destruction' al its core. Wc have 
a representative government, 
but we can do something. That 
is why you have state and federal 
legislators They are there lo be 
your voice in the government. 



If a legislali 



r doesn't know 



constituent's fault. The constituency 

legislators lo read their minds. 
Well, Ihey can't read minds, so 
wc need to step up and let il t&gt;e 
known, we do not wont to go to 
war. Write a letter, make a call, 
go lo a rally and find other ways 
to get involved. Just do some-

Lore from the Emerald Isles 



SainI Pjlricl&gt;s Day a shrouded 
legends. 35 is Ihc bnd (rom whkh il is spawned, 
Ireland, The Emerald Isle, as it is popularly 
known, has a long and rich hislory dating back 
thousands oi years, from Druids lo Celtic 
warriors, Irom bagpipers to modcm-iiay freedom 
fillers. In the Irish spirit, and lo celebrate my 
Irish heritage, this article will briedv mention 
some ollhe more popular legends Irom Inis country. 

A very innately Irish symbol is thai oF the 
shamrock. This legend is at Christian descent, 
although il came about when Ireland was primarily 
pagan. It tics in directly wUh Saint Patrick, who 
was a bishop. II Ls said that he used the thicc-sec- 
lioned leaf of the shamrock to symbolize the Holy 
Tnnily o( Chrislianily — Ihe father, the son and 
Ihc Holy Spirit. He showed people thai even 
Ihough the leaf was in three sections, il made up 
one leaf, much like Ihe Christian doctrine. The 
ereen of Ihc shamrock ia one of the reasons why 
inc official Saint Patrick's Day color is green, as 
well as Ihe fact thai the Irish landscape is green all 

A legend thai is 
nol well known in 
the United Stales is 
that of the Blarney 
Stone. This dales 
back to Ihc reign of 
(Jueen blizabcTh I. 
who, like many 
English rulers

impose her 
oppressed Ireland- 
Co rmac MacDermol 
MacCarthy: the Lord 
of Blarney, was select- 



make Ihe case oi his people for the freedom of 
Ireland. Unforlunalely, he was not fluent of 
speech and abhorred public speaking. As he was 
making his journey to England, all Ihe while 
dreading speaking lo her court, an old woman 
came across Ihe path and asked why he was look- 
ing so sad. He told her why. and she said that 
there was one slonc in Ihe wall of Ihe Castle of 



back to Blarney, found the slone and was 
blessed wilh this gill- He then went to preseni his 
case to Queen Eli^jbelh. He made such a good 
case that Ireland was granted freedom from 
England- 
Leprechauns, "Ihe wee men" as Ihey are also 
known, are elfish little men clad in green who 
make shoes in woodland underground lair^ and 
have tremendous riches in the form of pots of gold 
hidden under various landmarks. Legend tells of 
a man who once caught a leprechaun and ordered 
Ihe wee man lo take him lo his pot of gold. The 
leprechaun led him lo a bush wlicrc he said the 

Said was buried. The man tied a handkerchief to 
ic bush and rushed home lo get a shovel lo dig 
up Ihe pot. He ivas gone for just five minutes and 
when he rchimed to Ihe area, all of Ihe bushes in 
the field had a handkerchief lied to them! 

Very popular in Ireland and in America as 
iwcll, arc the gold or silver rings called daddaghs. 
They consist of a cro\smed heart held in place by a 
pair of hands, or some variation thereof. There ; 
many different theories as to how this 
jewelry came to be, but tti 
was developed in Ireland. 

It is allributed mostly to Richard Joyce, who 
lived in a small fishing village called Galway Bay 
in the mid-1600s- During the same week he was 
jsed lo wed his sweetheart, he was captured 



designed Ihe cfaddagh, a symbol 
of love. The hearl reprcscnls, obvi- 
ously, love; the crown represents 
loyally and Ihe hands, friendship. 
It was intended to be worn in 
different positions on 
different hands lo show marital or 
romantic status. To wear Ihe ring 
on Ihe right hand with the point of 
the hearl facing out shows that the 
wearer's heart has not yet been 
won. To wear il on Ihe righl hand 
wiih Ihe poinl of Ihe heart facing 
inward, snows that love has been 
found and is being considered- To 
wear the claddagh on Ihe left 
hand with the hearl facing inward 
is lo show Ihat the heart of the 
wearer has been won and the tivo 
loves have become inseparable. 

Anolher legend that comes 
out of this land is that of Ihe Magic 
Harp, although it is best knoivn in 
Ihe form of a poem written by an 
anonymous author entitled, "The 
Legend ol Ireland's Magic Harp,"

The above only touches on a few of Ihe m.my 
legends lo emerge from this myslcrious land. 
Because of the nature of legends, Ihey cannot be 
proven hislorically, but there is often a good 
amount ot evidence to support it. It all depends on 
what is believed by the listener. These legends cm 
be taken with a grain of sail, or with all the tea in 
China. No matter what is believed, Irish lore Is 
enlertaining and has been popular for centuries. 



Ehrenreich 

From page 1 



"It's really hard to do," she 
explained. In Minnesota, 
Ehrenreich had lo rent a cheap 
motel room for about Sl.OOO per 
month wilhout a refrigeralor or 

money on last food. "It adds 
mQr(^_Eipcnse. .J.l!a . acluallv 
cheaper to be middle class. Us 
more expensive lo be poor in 
some ways when you keep 
getting in tangles like that," 
she believes. 

She didn't feel safe or 
happy with her Minnesota 
situation, but realised she had it 
better than others living in Ihc 
some situation. She believes she 
had several advantages. 
Psychologically, she knew it 
was a three-month gig, not a 
long-term struggle. Also, she 
wasn't coming oft ot welfare 
and wasn't trying to raise 
children while working at the 
same time. She also believes 
being white assisted her wilh 
belter job situations. 

"1 was steered away from 
jobs like housekeeping and 
toward things like waitrcssing. I 
began lo understand there is a 
color dynamic. Thai is pretty 
sad lo report," Ehrenreich 

She met people who were 
nol gelling by, including people 
who were homeless by most 
definitions, but nol necessarily 
by their own. "In America, we 
now have a hierarchy of home- 
lessness. It you have a vehicle lo 
sleep in, you don't consider 
yourself homeless," Ehrenreich 
said. She also saw people who 
weren't eating enough in the 
physically exhausting work of 
housekeeping. 

Even into the middle class, 

anxiety" she said. Americans 
worry that the loss of a job or 
sudden severe illness could 
wipe them out financially. 
Ehrenreich spoke of underpaid 
workers, including social work- 
ers, school teachers and librari- 

A lot ol other people have 
become much richer in the past 
20 years, she noted. I'eople al 
Ihc top of corporations arc 
eaming400 limes the amount as 
people at Ihe bo I lorn, a much 
brger divide than in any olher

"That's actually pretty modest 
tor a CEO. 1 don't know how he 
docs it," she laughed. 

Comparing that CEO to 
her S7 an hour job, she noted il 
would lake her about 2,000 
ycats to earn what lie will earn 



She Ihinks America is 
becoming both an economic and 
a morally polarized society. 
Ehrenreich felt it was ironic Ihat 
there is a mylh that low-paid 
workers are mote apl lo be 
criminals, lazy and sexually 
promiscuous, while the affluent 
are more moraL In Ihe lasl 18 
months, several prominent 
companies and CEOs have been

"At the top, apparently 
anything goes." she said. She 
compared a Ihcit by one 
employee which netted him 
four years in jail as opposed to 
the allegation that a CEO stole

about the n,

"If we continue this way, this 
trend toward polarization and a 
government tnat does nol care 
about these things al all... We 
will become a nation ever more 
divided tietween the haves and 
luvc-nots." Ehrenreich believes. 

"I don't care how many 
bumper slickers say 'United We 
Stand.' We are not united... We 
are tuming into a society divided 
between gated communities on

children and elderly. -We don't

if thai has negative connota- 
tions. We could just call it a care-

Locally, people are taking 
action, she noled. Towiu and 
counties are pushing for "living 
wages" for irwoming companies. 
University students are also 
starling movements to push for 
t&gt;etter living for their campus 
workers, she said. 

Even the anti-war move- 
ment is helping, Ehrenreich 
believes. It is pointing out 
America has more enemies than

we need lo be defended against — 
things like poverty, hunger and
