Tile letlutc, the last in Ihe

Ihe audience insight into the 
harsh obstacles one musi over- 
come when starling a magazine. 

Haubegger said she originally 
got the idea for the magazmc 
while in law school, "I remember 
thinking il was realty odd when 

She added thai, 'As a lecnag' 
cr. I read a lot ol Iccn magazines, 
bul 1 always fell left out." 



Haubcgger took some mac- 
keting classes m law school and 
eventually wrote a marketing 
plan for LATINA ui 1993. -'One 
of my professors told me it was 
an interesting idea and I should 
pursue it," she said. 

"Unforturmtely. you need mil- 
lions of dollars lo start a maga- 
zine like LATINA," she said, 
relating the struggles she was 
about lo embark on in gelling 
the new nugDZine started. 'Il 
took me many years to raise 



even a few thousand dollars, i 
knocked on 190 polential 
mveslors' doors before 1 got

By Todd Hamm, News Editor 

On April 11 and 12, IPFW stu- 
dents had a chance to tell a 
National Public Radio corre- 
spondent whal Ihey thought of a 
drug law that elfeclivcly elimi- 
nates financial aid for anv stu- 
dent convicted on a drug charge. 

The reporter, Claudio 
Sanchez, an education corce- 
spondenl for NPR. came to Fort 
Wayne while working on a slory 
about the drug law, a provision 
lo Ihe Higher Education Act and 
ils primary author. Congressman 
Mark Scuder, 

The provision eutrenlly pro- 
hibits students from receiving 
financial aid if Ihey answer 
"yes" to a question on the 
Federal Financial Aid applica- 
tion that asks whether Ihey have 
ever been charged and convicted 
for a drug offense. 

The provision, written and 
passed into law in 1998, has 
steadily affected more and more 
students. 

Last year alone, it kept nearly 
47,000 students from receiving 
financial aid, Sanchez said. 
"It'sanimportanlstory thalis

Sanchez said. 

Sanchez met with three peer

First 1 

editorial. I 



Hl'IIo, ever)'one. 1 have been fol- 
lowing the editorial column in The 
Communicator for some time now, 1 
noticed that the voices and opinions 
expressed here were very limited. I 
thought thai another, new voice would 
add a much needed dimension lo the 
paper. So here I am. 

I have agreed lo write from the 
left, which lefl me thinking: What is the 
left, and what ate leftist views reaUy 
like? And what is the right? We have 
seen and read Nathan's views, writing 
from the right. Are those views a true 
of the right? I have lo admit I have been puz:zled, 
nl lo clarify the fact Ihat this is an opinion page, an 
n't believe that any one person can speak for an 
'ntira ^roup, especially a group as large as the "Lefties" and the 
■'Righties," I Bce myself as a moderate left, but I will be happy to 
eipress my opinion. Just the very natura of the titles "Righr and 
"Left" implies correctness. After all, aren't wc taught right from 
left, or right from wrong, at an early age? Just the names leave us 
lefties at a disadvantage, one that keeps us always on the defense: 
after all, we arc always left. 

When 1 was young, and 1 am dating myself with this slalc- 
menl. children who were left handed ivere discouraged from 
using their lell hand. The teachers used all types of tactics lo 
encourage a proper right. Sometimes it worked and they were 
able lo break the leltics and move them to the nghl. Some l&gt;ecame 
ambidextrous, able lo move back and forth with ease. Other times, 
no amount of effort would break the lefbes. 

Let's face it — our counh^ was founded upon the idea of 
"Right" and "Left." and the right were in poiver, They were, in 
general, white Christian males. Anyone not cdhfomiing lo their 
right opinion suffered, through persecution and often clealh. 
Exampfes are easy lo find: Ihe Indians, or natives of this land, and 
the witch triaLs, leap lo mind. Whew! We can all sigh a deep sigh 
of relief that that doesn't still happen today C^ does it? 

The right has giovm, now representing the Republican Party, 
the conservatives, the Moral Majority. Ttie left represents the 
Democratic Party, the liberals, Ihe Irrunoral Minority. Today all is 
fair — Ihe lefties have a voice. We live in a democratic society with 
freedom of speech and everyone having an equal voice. Today no 
oneiskilledbecauseofhisorherleftistoeliefs; we are not viewed 
by the right as wrong. Or are we? 

Just yesterday in one of my classes my classmates were dis- 
cussing religion. 1 was lol3" that my religious beliefs might be 
offensive to young Christians jvho didn't understand. It would be 
best if I kept mv beliefs to myself. What if I find that opiiuon 
offensive? Should it be kept quietly lo the right? What about Ihe 
gay bashing? Does anyone remember the Laramie Project, 
Matthew ShepanI? 1 believe that was about perceived right and 
loll, right vs wnjng, moral versus immoral. How long has il been 
since an abortion clinic was bombed? Docs killing make killing 
righl? Vflio determines right from left? 

I am left, a lefhe for as long as I can lemEmber. 1 believe m 
loving your neighbor, i believe in protecting the envirorunenl. I 
am a tree hugger, I believe in loving compassion, tolerance and 
conRict resolution. I believe that bailies can be fought without 
name-calling and without violence. Like Martin Luther King, Jr.. I 

I believe that there are no freaks of nature, only things that 
we, as limited humans, cannot understand. I believe in individual 
rights lo choice. I believe in a truly democratic system — a syslem 
where the majority really does have a voice. I believe that if each 
capable individual reacncd out and helped just one other less 
capable individual, the world would be a much belter place. I 
believe that freedom for all means acceptance of diversity — Ifial 
anyone who cbims to have all the answers lives in fear and delu- 
sion. I do not believe in anger, vengeance or violence as a solution. 
I do not believe thai any woman or man is omniscient, all know- 
ing. It is those who claim lo be ri^t Ihat I fear the most. But I am 
a leftie and that's just my opinion.

Dear Discouraged Don, 

It seemed to me that the bookstore not having any merchandise fea-

decided to take action. It was time for an un'dsrcover op. otherwise I would 
have been recognized for sure. Dressed in my girifrlend's Easter dress (a hot 
little numbef, if I do say so myself), high heels and a tiny camcorder In my 
purse. I was off to the bookstore to find out what they were covering up. 
Wher] I arrived, I began scoping out the place, but my cover must have been 
blown because a store employee approached me to see If he could 'help me.' 

I was sure to never be heard from again, a la Jimmy Hoffa. I was gonna 
be swimmin' with the fishes. Thinking quickly, I blurted out, 'Why is there 
no Mastodon merchandise here?' And then... Well, he answered my ques- 
tion. Apparently there's some sort of licensing problem andlhey hope to 
have some merchandise in the fail. He was quite friendly actually. It kind of 
made the mascara seem a bit unnecessary, But nevertheless, Al came to the 
rescue again, answering all of IPFW's pressing questions.

Grade A Tattoos and Body Piercing, located in 
the Marketplace of Canterbury, has over 30 years of 
experience in Ihe art of tattooing and body piercing. 
1 walked into Grade A not knowing anything about 
tattooing and after one interview with Doug 
Malleson, tattoo artist. I left with more than a basic 
understanding. 

Surprisingly enough, their tattoo artists are self- 
taught and served a four to 18 month apprentice- 
ship. Before learning that, I thought that all the art 
s pre-drawn

I only had a few

Malleson reclines in Ihe seat where ^^^'S^ ^"'^ '^°'- 
he gains some of his inspiration. °'^ ^^ ^^'l- 

"The cus- 
tomer is always right," declares Matteson. 

When asked a few basic questions such as the 
most popular place, tattoo and piercing, I found that 
the most popular styles are the traditional hearts, 
roses and names. As for places on the body, 
Matteson has found that women prefer the lower 
back, while men lean more towards the arms. 

According lo Matteson, when it comes to select- 
ing a color for a tattoo, people should take their nat- 
ural skin coloring into consideration, A basic outline 
sometimes looks just as nice as a tattoo with color. 
When it comes to pain, don't think bone; think 
more along the lines of hcklish places such as inner 
legs and stomachs. In order to trap the ink. the nee- 
dle must penetrate three of the eight layers of skm 
and it generally lakes one week to heal. 

"[A latloo] is sinular to an abrasion that you 
would get from a rug bum," says Matteson. 

Grade A is an exceptionally dean and sterile 
parlor. All instruments are packaged and several 
powerful cleaning products that can kill any disease 
from HIV lo hepatitis are used. 





Tattoo Testlmonia 



By Kathy Delagrange, Editor 

When we originally decided on the topic of tattoos and 
body piercings, I thought it only logical to get some input 
from someone who actually has a tattoo. Tracy, one of my 
closest friends got her first tattoo about nine years ago and 
has recently acquired a second. 

Her first tattoo, a charming little butterfly located on her 
right shoulder, was done in color, and contrary to the mistak- 
en belief that some have regarding the use of colored ink, her 
tattoo has nol faded at all. "1 got that latloo done at a place 
called Professional Touch in Van Wert (Ohio), and they gave 
me a lifetime guarantee that if it ever faded, they'd touch it up." 
Not one to leap without first looking. I asked Tracy what 
it was that convinced her to gel her first work of body art. 

"I think they're (tattoos) cool — they're unique. For me, it 
was a way to make a statement about myself." 

Tracy described the actual procedure as being "more of a 

^ 1 burning sensation. It hurts at first, 

^^^^^^^ but then you get used to il and it's 

^^^^RH not so bad. The part where he was 

^^^^ I^V going over the bone was the part that

Ancient body art pierces 
contemporary culture 

By Kathy Delagrange, Editor 

Like a diamond in the rough, the leopard- 
print building that houses Modem Primitive 
Exotic Body Piercing &amp; Custom Tattooing pro- 
vides a uniquely different look than what is 
found in much of downtown Fort Wayne. 

Located at 2034 Broadway, Modem Primitive 
IS home to a number of tattoo and piercing artists. 
Patrons need not worry about getting what they 
want: with over 41 years of combined experience, 
the artists will accommo- 
date your most exodc tat- 
too or piercing desires. 

DerekWhelselisa 
self-taught artisan, favoring 
the tattooing trade, 'Tve 
been doing tattoos for 
about 11 years now and I 
still really enjoy my work," 

When questioned 
about the declining popu-

become such a profitable industry that ink 
companies have put hme into developing bel- 
ter ink. Truthhilly, the old ink s'ucks a". 
Today, tattoos done with color last better and 
you don't have the problem with fading," 
When asked if he had any advice for 
potential tattoo candidates, Whetsel recom- 
mended that people not get a talloo or pierc- 
ing done over Spring Break, parbcularly if the 
person is going oul of toivn to a more popular 
vacation spot. "Chances are you're going to 
end up someplace where they're trying to get 
as many people through as possible and 
they're going to mess up your tattoo. Just 
wait unbl you get back and have it done 
here at Modem Primitive where you know 
itil be done right." 

Although Whetsel works mainly with 

ink, he noted that the tongue is the most

Day at the Spa Part I: Esperanza Spa and Salon 



By Reree Thompson, Special Sections Editor 




Pholo by Eugene tiardlng. Staff 
Photographer 
Renee Thompson soaks her feel in 
honey, milk and rose waler. The first 
Klep in a spa pedicure. 



With finals time rapidly approaching, 
my editor and I thought il best thai we 
parlake in a nice relaxing day at the spa. 
About four and a half hours later, we left 
as relaxed, new women and with one 
tired and cranky photographer. 

"No man should be subjected to four 
and a half hours al the spa, taking pictures 
of women getting their hair and nails 
done," said Andrew Howard, 
Corrununicator sports editor. 



After a long winter of wearing heeled 
boots and heavy socks, it's finally time to 
break out the sandals. I figured, though, 
before i got too excited, maybe I should 
treat my weather and shoe-beaten feet to a 
spa peclicure. Sure, I can paint my toenails 
myself, but a pedicure is so much more. 

First, Crystal Avery, nail tech at 
Esperanza Spa and Salon, soaked my feet in 
warm water with honey, milk and rose petals- 

"The milk exfoliates, the honey draws 
out the toxins and the rose petals just 
make you feel pretty," explains Avery. 

My feel were allowed to soak for 10 
minutes before being brought out and 
blotted off. The cuticles were then pushed 
back and trimmed. My feel were put back 
in the rose water to rinse for a few sec- 
onds. Afterwards, Avery got out a lava 
stone used for removing calluses. 

"We use the lava stone instead of the 
normal pumice stone because il has larger 
holes," says Avery 

After the calluses were removed came 
the sugar and walnut foot scrub. This grit- 
ty mixture was rubbed into my feet and 
calves, allowing the first layer of skin to 
be moisturizecf and exfoliated. My feet 
and calves were then rinsed and grape 
seed oil. an antioxidant that keeps the skin 
smooth, was applied. 

Next came the most relaxing part of 
the whole process — the foot cream and 
massage. Avery then turned into a psy- 
chic, telling me that 1 wear heels too much 
and that they are adding tension to the 
arches and balls of my feet. Needless to 
say, she was not lying, but after the mas- 
sage, all of that tension was alleviated. 

Then it was time for the polish. In 
knowing that the bnght bold reds and 
pinks are in style for this season, I went 
with OPI's color Chilano Caliente, which 
is a bold, yet muled shade of red. Avery 
noted that one should only lei pobsh stay 
on for four weeks, especially the red col- 




ors. If the polish stays on any | 
longer, there is a chance that the I 
nails will yellow. She also said to I 
always wear a base coal, which I 

will prevent yellowing, and a top)- I 
coat, which will protect the polish I 
from chipping. 

Well, now my toenails 
summer sandal ready and 
hooked on pedicures. Not only 
was it relaxing but the service was 
magnificent. The staff was pleasant I 
and the prices are college-student I 
friendly. Granted, some may say I 
that S35 is too much for a peciicure, I 
but if people shop around, they will I 
find that, for a spa pedicure, [

Takaoka of Japan 

305 East Superior Street 

424-3183 

My first porf-of-caU is one that has 
been a favorite of mine for a long time. 
If you like Japanese food and want a lit- 
tle floor show as you sit at your table, 
you simply must go to Takaoka of 
Japan, located above Don Hall's Gas 
House on the comer of Lafayette and 
Superior. 

I will walk you through what will 
happen during your dining experience. 
Upon entenng the building, you walk 
Up the stairs. As you cross the thresh- 
old into the big room, it is dark and 
exotic smelling. One wall is lined with

with a bridge over it in the front. 

In the actual dining area, you will see 
several large tables thai seat approxi- 
mately 10-12 people, with a large 
hibachi range on one side of it. After 
being sealed at your table, you are 
served by waitresses in beautiful, intri- 
cately designed kimonos. Your first 
course is a basic soup wjlh a light and 
tangy broth, mushrooms, green onions 
and little crunchy things. 

Next comes the salad. The only disap- 
pointment Takaoka will give you may lie 
in the plain salad, unless of course exot- 
ic vegetables turn you off. The salad con- 
sists of iceberg lettuce 
with a lovely quaint 
ginger dressing.

College Cuisine 



By Andy Welfte, Reporter 

Are you culinarily challenged? In other 
words, is your idea of cultural cuisine 
getting an egg roU at the drive-thru in the 
Chinese Express eatery? Do you consider 
"pulling out the stops" supersizing your 
McDonald's combo n:\eal? 

If these questions sound vaguely familiar, 
let me help you. Let's face it — many college 
students live on pizza and hamburgers. 
There is something to be said for being so 
easily satisfied, but what do you do if you 
are trying to impress a date? 

Well, I recently took a tour of some fim, 
upscale cultural restaurants here in town, 
and I will give you the metaphorical scoop 
on two of my favorites. 



and $29.95 for the lobster. Yes, it is rather 
pricey. However, since you are getting a 
great shovkf out of it, many would con- 
sider the expense to be worth it. 

About the only 

drawback to eating 

at Takaoka that I can 

see is the recycled 

jokes used during 

fwi- /jiruAi the chef's spiel and

with rice, grilled zucchini, onions, bean 
sprouts and shrimp tliat is out of this world. 
The different meals include larger 
shrimp, chicken, steak (the famous Don 
Hall's filet mignon), scallops or lobster. 

Meals range in price from S15.95 for

Chop's Steak and Seafood 
6421 West Jefferson Blvd. 
436-9115 

My second visit was to Chop's Steak 
and Seafood, former- 
ly known as the 
Bagatelle Bistro, out 
southwest at 6421 
West Jefferson 
Boulevard.

as described 
by a waiter 
"California- 
style food 
with a 

French bistro 
influence." 
Chop's pos- 
sesses a quiet, 
trendy, 
upscale 
ambiance, 
with small 
candle 
lamps at 

each table Chop's, locaied 
and a bottle ^s'^"""' ^"^ Cahfom.a-style food 
of Perrier standing by. The Italian caki 



lettuce was very fresh, and the crou- 
tons were crunchy, but the caesar 
dressing was very tangy, almost too 
langy. 

The mam course was served to 
me very attractively and symmetri- 
cally organized. I must adnut, I have 
no idea what a sambuca is, but the 
sauce that it %vas in was buttery and 
delicious. 

The porta bello mushrooms were 
sautccd in something that made 
them too sweet, but at the same 
time, the sweetness of that sautfi 
gave the onions superb texture and 
flavor. 

The chicken was grilled very 
well, although it was a little too 
charred on the bottom, which gave 
that portion of it an unattractive 
dryness. 

For a lighter recourse, Chop's 
has a large selection of sandwich- 
es. Staying'with the same theme of 
fowl, the Chicken Provolone Melt 
(S6.95) is lighter on your stomach, as 
well as your wallet. 
This features an open-faced sour- 
dough sandwich with strips of chick- 
en, sauteed mushrooms and onions, all 
topped with melted provolone cheese. 
On the sandwich, the chicken was 
not dry at all, and the provolone was 
gooey and warm. 
As with the grilled 
chicken platter, Ihe 
onions were won- 
derfully sweet, and 
"not oniony," as

the menu and it is described as being 
served with "marinated portabello 
mushrooms, red peppers, sweet 
onions, mashed potatoes and a sambu-

All in all, this dish is excellent. As a 
precursor to the meal, I was brought a 
caesar salad, which was mediocre. The

One of the advantages to this restau-

the cleanliness of the kitchen, as
