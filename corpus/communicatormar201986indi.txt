Calculating Ph.Ds gathered here 



By EARL SMITH 

Chief Reporter 

At one lime, the people of 

Konigsberg, Prussia, tried to find a 
route that crossed each bridge in the 
city only once. "The mathematician 
Leonhard Euler proved that such a 
route couldn't exist and in doing so 
founded the subject of Graph Theory," 
said Marc Lipman, associate professor 
of mathematical sciences at IPFW. 

Although most people are not 
familiar with graph theory, it affects 
us every day "Graph theory is the 
study of finite sets of objects with 
relationships between pairs of those 
objects. For example, the set of major 
cities of the United States is related by 
the long-distance telephone lines 
running between them, "said Lipman 

The idea for a 250th anniversary 
conference came from a British 
scholar who recommended the idea lo 
some IPFW faculty at a one-day 
conference last year. Several "world 
class" scholars were invited under the 
assumption that some would decline, 
but none did, said Lipman. 

Included among the distinguished 
visitors lo the conference was a three- 
generation academic "family." Frank 
Haray, distinguished visiting 
professor of computer science at New 
Mexico Slate University, was Lowell 
Beineke's mentor Beineke, associate 
professor of mathematical sciences at 
IPFW, is Kunwarjit Bagga's assistant 
professor of mathematical sciences, 
mentor.

fine arts professor Hector Garcia was 
presented to Haray to commemorate 
his 65lh birthday. 

Mayor Win Moses, Jr. proclaimed 
March 10-15 as Fort Wayne Graph 
Theory Week. "The Department of 
Mathematical Sciences at Indiana- 
Purdue Universities in Fort Wayne is 
one of the most active centers of graph 
theory research in the United States," 
Moses said. 

A major workshop at the conference, 
"Directions for Research in Eulerian 
Graph Theory," was conducted by 
Professor Herbert Fleischner of the 
Austrian Academy of Sciences In 



Vienna. 

Another workshop, "Computer 
Display and Manipulation of Graphs, 
and the Requisite Algorithms," was 
conducted by Professor Ronald C. 
Read, UniversityofWaterloo, Ontario. 

Other speakers were from Great 
Britain. 

The conference was co-sponsored by 
Miami University, OH; Western 
Michigan University; IPFW; the 
Central States Universities, Inc.; the 
Magnavox Government and Industrial 
Electronics Company; and the 
Argonne Universities Association 
Trust Fund.

"It is rare when one University gives 
another money for a conference," said . 
Lipman. 

Lipman's goal was for participants, 
"to have a good time, learn a lot and 
leave with a good feeling of IPFW." 

This goal was accomplished. "Many 
conferees stayed after the conference 
ended Saturday to eat dinner 
together," said Lipman.

faculty and students alike. After initial 
contact is made, recruiters keep the 
candidates' interest high with in- 
tensive follow-up programs and

Career changes studied 



By JULIE MAGSAMEN 
Stall Writer 

After 18 years of moving across the 
country with her husband in the armed 
services. Maureen Gallagher finally 
settled in Fort Wayne and decided to 
investigate career possibilities for 
herself. She started by asking 
quest ions of everyone and anyone ; her 
realtor, insurance agent, new neigh- 
bors and friends. 

The answers she got gave her an 
insider's view of Fort Wayne and led to 
several job interviews (all of which she 
viewed as practice sessions for the one 
that would really count). Gallagher did 
land a job with Nutri-Systems Weight 
Loss Medical Center and today Is 
manager of the southwest office. 

Gallagher's story of re-entering the 
job market, as well as stories told by 
people who changed careers or started 
their own businesses, was part of the 
second Alumni Career Change 
Workshop, held recently at IPFW, 
sponsored by the alumni office and 
counseling, testing, and placement 
services. 

During the pre-dinner workshops, 
Caryl Malone, director of human 
resources services for the employee 
benefit division of Lincoln National 
Life Insurance Co., conducted a 



Resume Makeover Her 
advice was lo present an "eye- 
catching" resume, keeping il neat and 
professional in appearance. 

Richard Maples, manager of David 
Culp and Co., led alumni through a 
mock interview stressing the do's and 
don'ts of interviewing. Marian Adair, 
acting director of counseling, testing, 
and placement, helped alumni in- 
terpret their personality-interest in- 
ventory results. 

The keynote speaker was Joanne 
Lantz, professor and chair of the IPFW 
department of psychological sciences, 
whose talk was tilled: "Is Change 
Possible?" Following her presen- 
tation, alumni divided into workshops 
on career changes for educators, re- 
entering the job market, and starting 
over — being your own boss. Panelists 
included Hal Vizino, educational 
coordinator for Parkview Memorial 
Hospital (a former teacher for Fort 
Wayne Community Schools); 
Margaret Hardin, vice-president and 
trust officer with Fort Wayne National 
Bank I former English teacher) ; 
Barbara Daniel, business manager for 
Lutheran Hospital; Bette Peterson, 
president of Media Matters; Jon 
Alger, owner of Data Professionals; 
and Barbara Byrne, president of Vera 
Bradley Designs. 



presentations, 

The faculty and staff program has 
been very successful according to 
Ellison. ' 'We are very fortunate to gain 
highly qualified teachers and staff 
members through the efforts of this 
program. Locally we are gaining 
ground with each month and year the 
project has been in effect Minorities, 
especially the blacks and Hispanics, 
are recognizing the opportunities, 
challenges, and career potential 
availabale at Indiana-Purdue 
University." 

Since 1983, IPFW has added nine 
minority members to the faculty and 
administrative staff, five to the 
clerical staff, one to the service staff, 
and two lo the technical staff. 

"We are making continuous efforts 
to find and hire qualified minority 
employees for campus clerical and 
service staff positions," according to 
Pat Hudson, employment and benefits 
administrator at IPFW. 

When recruiting high school and 
middle school students, heavy em- 
phasis is placed on career choices or 
educational goals after high school. 
This helps students gain some un- 
derstanding of how to go about plan- 
ning their future. Minority students 
already attending college volunteer 
their time to visit the high schools and. 
middle schools. The younger students 
relate well to the older students, and 
the enthusiasm expressed by both 
parties make this a very positive 
experience for future alumni. The 
program also causes some students to 
start iheir application process earlier 
because they have a more definite goal 
as to their career choice. Even though 
the emphasis is on minorities, all 



students are welcome to listen lo and 
receive the valuable information pre- 
sented at the schools. 

The Affirmative Action Program 
does not stop with the recruitment of 
the student. A special emphasis is 
placed on keeping the student at 
campus. There are counsellors and 
programs available to help keep the 
student's goals in focus. The students 
are assigned to small groups, and 
informal meetings are held lo inspire 
confidence or to provide possible 
solutions to any problems These 
groups also provide positive role 
models for the newer campus mem- 
bers. A good network is established 
between students and campus. There 
is a good "give and take" that helps 
keep enthusiasm and interest high 
with the students. 

"An effective minority recruitment 
program does not jusl happen. It is an 
active process that requires campus 
commitment, community in- 
volvement, careful planning, and 
intensive, personal follow-through," 
explained Edward A. Nicholson, ac- 
ting chancellor. "I am delighted that 
Purdue has selected IPFW for this 
coveted award and congratulate the 
four staff members, Uimer, Mid- 
dleton, Hudson, and Ellison, whose 
efforts are most responsible for this 
achievement." 

The President's Annual Affirmative 
Action Awards program was 
established two years ago by Beering. 
The purpose of the award is to honor 
units making exemplary contributions 
to affirmative action on behalf of 
women or minorities at Purdue 
University. Recipients are selected by 
a nine-member committee.

Coupon book sale continues 

By MICHELE R. SHAFFER 
Managing Editor 

The Disabled Student Services department will continue to sell their Dine-a- 
matecoupon books at a discount through March 26. 

"Instead of costing S12. the books will be *10," said Barb Johnson, director of 
Disabled Student Services. The books will be sold in the Sweete Shoppe in Walb 
Memorial Union and in the basement of Kettler Hall Johnson emphasized how 
economical the coupon books are for students, with coupons to area restaurants 
and businesses. There are several Iwo-for-one dinner coupons in the book, added 
Johnson. ■ 

The proceeds from the sate of Dine-a-mate coupon books will go to buy equip- 
ment for the disabled students services department. "All proceeds will go to 
disabled student services in help of purchasing the equipment the students so 
desperately need."

It's a people problem, 
not a phone problem! 



It 9eems the new GTE phone system 
installed at IPFW over spring break is a 
double-edged sword. 

The new phone system — with all of its 
shiny new features — brings IPFW's 
phone communications into the 1980s. 
The old system, which was 14 years old, 
caused frustration for many people. Our 
new computerized system, the GTE 
Omni series, is definitely an 
improvement. 

First of all, it has more line capacity. 
With the old system, IPFW had 700 
phones and only 350 phone lines. With the 
new system, each phone has its own line. 
Secondly, there are many, many new 
features. For example, on the Omni 
series, an IPFW phone user can 
participate in a three-way conference 
call, can transfer calls easier, and pick 
up calls on phones in other offices. 

Why are so many people complaining? 
Part of the reason might be that humans 
are naturally resistant to change — of 
any kind. Many people around here had 
complained about the phone system we 
had. Now we have an excellent system, 
and people are still complaining. 

Another reason for the frequent 
grumbling we are hearing across 
campus could be due to the fact the 
training program left much to be 
desired. Mark English, director of 
general services, said not enough people 
attended the training sessions. This 
might not be the total fault of these 
people Some of the sessions ran 20 
■: minutes to one-half hour late. Students, 



faculty and staff, with their tight 
schedules, don't have the time to stand 
around for 20 minutes and wait until the 
previous class get done deciphering all 
these complicated, new features. 

They can't be expected to wait a half- 
hour, making them late for their other 
obligations. 

Secondly, the training program was 
very generic. It was not adapted to 
IPFW's specific needs. The women 
training us to use the new phones were 
not able to answer detailed questions 
asked by several staff members. They 
were not knowledgeable about concerns 
that IPFW phone users might have. 

All in all, the change and 
improvements in the phone system have 
been positive, but it has carried with it 
many unnecessary problems. A poor 
training program is at the top of the list. 
It is sad that the training left so many 
unanswered questions concerning daily 
usage at IPFW. Secondly, people have 
exhibited a very natural reaction — 
resistance to change. Our biggest 
obstacle now is to convince incoming 
callers to have patience with us as we 
hurriedly flip through our blue manuals, 
deciding whether to "flash" or "pound" 
them. 

When asked to transfer a call or put 
someone on hold, don't panic or get 
upset. Don't be afraid to try the new 
features — the only thing that can 
happen is that you get cut off. If that 
happens, it will give you an extra few 
minutes to figure out what to do when 
they call back! 



Don't complain, join in! 



It is once again the time of year when 
■;. we must all take part in choosing 
individuals to represent us. 

In years past, it seems students at 

IPFW take their role in choosing their 

campus representatives rather lightly, 

'■ yet it is these uninvolved students who 

.. seem to complain most frequently. 

The IPFW Students' Government 

Constitution and Bylaws state Students' 

. Government is created "to promote a 

high quality of education at this 

university, to meet the diverse 

educational and cultural needs of its 

': students, and to better insure their 

: control over their destiny." 

If this is what Students' Government 



stands for, students who complain must 
get involved. 

With active voices in Students' 
Government, needs can be met and 
complaints can be resolved. But, it takes 
active representatives! 

If you do not feel you are the active 
type needed to represent students, it is 
still your duty to take the time and care 
to choose appropriate leaders. If you 
don't vote, then don't complain. 

Students' Government elections will 
take place April B and 9. Any student 
wishing to run for an office may obtain a 
petition from the Student Services Office 
located in the Walb Memorial Union, 
room 118.

To the Editor: 

During this academic 
year, letters lo the editor and 
editorials in The Com- 
municator have suggested 
ways to improve campus 
parking, fund a new fine 
arts building, devise more 
convenient class schedules 
and generally make IPFW 
more responsive to student 
needs. Soon you will have the 
opportunity to do more than 
just make suggestions. You

important decisions about 
the services and programs 
funded by your student fees. 

Please take the time to 
become informed about the 
candidates and what each 
pledges to do for you and 
your campus. Even better, 
volunteer to become a 
candidate or committee 
member yourself. By con- 
tributing a few hours a week 
to Students' Government, 
you will see that one person 
can make a difference. 

While helping your 
university, you also will be 
gaining valuable experience 
that will enrich your college 
education. Many former 



student leaders have become 
well known in this com- 
munity. Some who readily 
come to mind are Cathy 
Ballou, weather person, 
WPTA-TV; Cheryl Brewer- 
Townsend, executive 
director, Fort Wayne Urban

To the Editor, 

I would like to take this 
opportunity to make the 
campus community 
of the upcoming Students' 
Government elections on 
Tuesday and Wednesday, 
April8and9. 

Students' Government is 
an excellent opportunity for 
all students to become in- 
volved in campus life and 
activities. Becoming a part 
of Students' Government 
will provide chances for you 
to work with and to gel to 
know students, faculty, and 
administration officials. 
Students' Government can

I would like to urge all 
students who have a little 
time to spare and who would 
like to become an integral 
part in making our campus 
one which serves student 
needs and concerns, to take 
a moment to pick up a

Sherlock Holmes lives at PIT 



ByMARYHARMAN 
Staff Writer 
If you're in hot pursuit of 
entertainment this weekend, 
then follow the clues lo the 
Purdue-Indiana Theatre for 
the Sherlock Holmes ad- 
venture, "The Sign Of The 
Four." 

Preview 

Too much about the plot 
cannot be revealed, since 
this is a mystery and that 
would spoil the suspense. I 
can say however, that 
Sherlock Holmes is once 
again teamed up with Dr. 
Watson in a case that in- 
volves mysterious letters, 
the curious disappearance of 



a girl's father, and the 
search for a stolen treasure 
Any further details (in- 
cluding what the title itself 
means) are closely guarded 
secrets. 

Michael Bowman, visiting 
instructor in Com- 
munications, wrote the 
adaptation and is directing 
the production. The play will 
be presented in chamber 
theatre form — a first for 

ipfw. 

According to Bowman, 
chamber theatre is a 
relatively new technique. It 
was developed in the 1940s 
by Robert Breen of Nor- 
thwestern University- Its 
rools however, go back to 
ancient Greek drama where 



the chorus would "speak" 
directly lo the audience 



In 



m.-.-U'i 



chamber 



theatre, prose literature is 
adapted lo the stage with the 
narrator being retained as a 
central story figure In 
discussing his interpretation 
of "The Sign Of The Four," 
Bowman said, "I wanted 
something theatrical that 
wasn't the usual 'Master- 
piece Theatre' type of 
adaptation, where the 
narrator is thrown out and a 
lot of new dialogue is in- 
vented." 

In Conan Doyles' Sherlock 
Holmes novels, Dr. Watson 
functions as both character 
and narrator. In Bowman's 
theatrical version, we are 
guided through the story 



from Watson's point of view 

"The Sign of The Four" 
features Kenneth Grover as 
Sherlock Holmes, John 
Swinehart as Dr. Watson, 
and Julie Ann Tharp as 
Mary Morston. Ruth Laurion

KAYSANS, LAKE AND BYPASS 
7 Minutes by Car 15 Minutes to Receive Order 

If you're a Mexican food affect ionado, you're 
probably familiar with Kaysan's, the Mexican, 

Oriental and American hideaway on Decatur Road 
famous for serving bountiful amounts of good food at 
moderate prices. 

Long famous for their nachitos, a platter of these at 
$5 is enough lo feed two people for lunch — more if 
you're a pack of snackers. Kaysan's nachitos are still 
buill individually — not a miscellany of toppings 
tossed on a pile of chips with cheese product drizzled 
over Ihe whole mess, like some places in lown. 

The base of a nacho at Kaysan's is a crisp triangular 
chip, amply lopped by your choice of meat and or 
beans, crowned by a slice of jalapeno all covered by a 
blanket of melted cheese. If you're not squeamish 
about eating with your fingers and you're among 
friends, go (or the side orders of sour cream and 
guacamole to load on top. 

While the food is certainly good, the service cer- 
tainly leaves something lo be desired That something 
is attentiveness. Our waitress was so preoccupied with 
performing a full scale manicure at the bar, that my 
companion resorted to waving his arm in Ihe air to get 
her attention for his only coffee refill — and this man's 
caffeine habit keeps Juan Baldez's mule in shoes. 
After he nursed ihe second cup of coffee for 20 
minutes, he tried to get her attention again, but she 
was now engrossed in relaying plans for her "hot 
date" that evening. 

However, the minute 1 took the last sip of my Coke, 
she bounded over to the table and announced, "I need 



So. if you like nachitos, enjoy watching the traffic go 
by and make up slories about where they're going, 
buzz down the Bypass to Kaysan's, bul tell the 
you're very thir-.lv

Teams gain respect, experience 



Commentary 

B&gt; TONYDl'NAWAV 
Staff Writer 
Men's Basketball 
In a season that saw many 
ups and downs for the 
Mastodons, Coach Tim 
Russell feels that many 
positive things were ac- 
complished. 

"We started the season 
with a lot of new players and 
the transition to the level of 
play required was a very big 
adjustment for all of them," 
said Coach Russell. "Our 
kids worked very hard and 
have kept a great attitude 
the whole season. They 
deserved better results than 
an B-20 season. Even though 
we had progressed a lol by 
the end of the season, we just 
could not get it translated 
into wins." 

The Mastodons have a lot 
of raw talent and as Coach 
Russell indicates, they had 
molded into a team that 
could be measured as a 
formidable foe capable of 
giving anyone in the con- 
ference a serious match. But 



still there was something 
missing; maybe it's the big 
man under the boards who 
can dominate the free throw 
lane both in rebounding and 
intimidating opposing 
shooters, or a perimeter 
player who can take the ball 
in with six or seven seconds 
led and make the decisive 
play in a one point game. I'm 
not trying to belittle any of 
the Mastodons because I feel 
every one of them gave 
Coach Russell and their fans 
as much as they had to give, 
and for that reason alone, 
I'm proud to be one of their 
followers. 

The players need to learn 
from this season and work 
towards next year and use 
the experience in what, for 
many of them, was the only 
losing season they have ever 
bad. They should go after 
their opponents with con- 
fidence and the same 
aggressiveness that earned 
them the respect they had 
gained as (he best defensive 
team in the conference. 
Women's Basketball 

After the first season at 



the helm of the Lady 'Dons. 
Coach Julie Calahan has 
little to hang her head about. 
Coach Calahan used hard 
work and an open door policy 
during her first full season 
as a head coach and coupled 
with an open, bubbly per- 
sonality, she has gained the 
friendship and respect of all 
who know her. 

Despite a disappointing 10- 
16 season, Coach Calahan 
said, "lam very pleased and 
happy with this season. Sure 
1 would have liked to have 
won more games but 
numbers are not indicative 
to what we have ac- 
complished this year. We 
started off well, but when 
our two seniors, Clara 
Trowbridge and Rita Boyle 
got hurt, we had to adjust 
and this was difficult 
because most of our 
statistical experience laid in 
those two, I think that our 
girls responded well and 
worked that much harder. 
Ail of our returning players 
showed marked im- 
provement over last year. I 
feel that the confidence that 



the girls developed towards 
the end of the season and 
the fact that each of them 
knows what I expect of them 
will be a big asset and I 
expect a much better season 
next year." 

Because the Lady 'Dons 
did only see limited action 
from Boyle and Trowbridge, 
and for the most part they all 
had to learn how to play a 
different type of game than 
that they had previously 
been playing, the Lady 'Dons 
had to suffer through a long 
transition stage. 

Coach Calahan often says, 
"Nobody on my team is 
irreplaceable," but Gara 
Trowbridge's dominance 
under the boards and Rita 
Boyle's prowess and hustle 
in the backcourt will be 
sorely missed next year. And 
if these two ladies are to be 
indicative of Coach 
Calahan's finished product, 
then IPFW and Coach 
Calahan can hold their heads 
proud and high.

Volleydon's roll over Fighting Irish 



ByCLAYHOUSHOUJER 
Staff Writer 

The IPFW men's 
volleyball team humiliated 
the Fightin' Irish of Notre 
Dame in a match at the 
Mulli-Purpose Building on 
Friday, March 7. 

The Volleydons never gave 
the Irish a chance lo get inlo 
the match. Even with 'Dons' 
Coach Arnie Ball sub- 
stituting liberally after the 
first game, Notre Dame was 
not up to the challenge. The 
entire match look only fifty- 
eight minutes as the 
Volleydons casually strolled 
to a 15-1, 15-3, 15-1 victory. 

The first game saw the 
Irish commit no less than

four ball handling 
leading to easy IPFW points. 
Troy White and Jay Gold- 
steyn served aces in the 
game for the Volleydons, 
and Phil Bodine assisted on 
kills by Loren Gebert and 
Ted Owen. The Irish couldn't 
seem to get anything to go 
their way on the attack or 
defensively. 

Early in the second game, 
IPFW's Owen provided four 
straight points by blocking 
the Irish offense back into 
the court. Owen also scored 
three kills in the game. 
Bodine, Keith Neargardner 
and Gebert also had kills, 
demonstrating a balanced 



id relaxed attack to the 
outgunned Irish. 

The Volleydons continued 
to dominate in the final 
game as the Irish gave up 
more points on passing 
errors and had very few 
chances to serve.

Back in the Stone Age. cave dwellers would rub two sticks 
together to ignite a fire for cooking. 

Today, smart homeowners are relying on new, gas ranges 
to do their cooking. Not only as a matter of convenience, 
but also as a way lo save energy and money. 

Call or visit your neighbors at The Gas Company or local gas 
appliance dealer for details on today's new, gas ranges. 

Anything else is like rubbing two sticks together.
