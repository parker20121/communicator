Opinion 



While r 



ourselves with taking classes, teaching 
&gt;oth, an important committee is meeting almost 
weekly to help decide the future for all of us. 

The committee is the Joint Faculty Ad Hoc Steering Committee, composed nf 
14 members of the faculties of Indiana and Purdue, three administrators, and two 
members of the student body. The committee is chaired by Dean James Gilbert 

The committee has just met for the 127th time. At the 126th meeting, there were 
ten faculty members present, two administrators and one student member 
Missing were four faculty members, one administrator, and one student. A check 
with sludents' government found that there has not bet 
appointed for the 1975-76 school year. 

The agenda of the 126th meeting was interesting. Aft 
committee voted to approve "the concept of a faculty senat

A noble resolution. One that points the way toward a combined faculty senate, 
which should be Ihe governing body of the IPFW faculty in the future. But after the 
126th meeting? And what alwut total university governance? Will it take another 
126 meetings lo resolve that question? At the present pace, the Ad Hoc committee 
will be meeting for at least two more years about resolving the (asks they were

session of the l wo family senates for approval, and then be approved by the total 
faculties before going lo the Boards of Trustees of Indiana and Purdue. The joint

. If you are Interested In Seeing the wheels of faculty government work, Ihen you 
might want to attend this open meeting. 

I No person at IPFW can disagree with the results obtained by this committee so 
far The members of this committee, for the most part, are conscientious about the 
magnitude of Iheir tasks, which certainly are tremendous, Bui. My God, 
committee move so slowly'' They can move faster. 

More importantly, should Sludents' Government so blatantly disregard the 

j respeel and co-operation of the faculty by not appointing student members on this 

, important committee, so that sludents are given a forum for their opinions? 

We think not. The student senate has recently been issuing a number of 
"demands" to the rest of the campus community ; perhaps it had better "demand" 
fair representation on this committee, which has so generously been offered by the 
faculties of IPFW Maybe then, the voice of Students' Government will be given Ihe

How to graduate as an 
Army officer in two years. 

An interview with LTC Hugh Munson, U.S.Army, 



LTC Hugh Munson 
stated this week that 
sophomores who did not 
take Military Science 
their freshman and sop- 
homore years may still 
becomeeligible for the 
two-years advanced Ar- 
my ROTC. LTC Munson 
explained that students 
who did not take the 
basic course may qualify 
for advanced ROTC by 
attending a special six- 
week summer program 
at Fort Knox.KY. At the 
basic camp, students 
receive instruction in 
military tactics, history, 
weapons, communicat- 
ions and leadership tech- 
niques. 

According to LTC 
Munson, "The ROTC 
basic camp stresses lea- 
dership development. Its 
purpose is to bring the 
student to a level of 
military education and 
experience which will 
al low him or her to enter 
the ROTC Program at 
the junior level." 

For most students, 
completion of either the 
basic course or the basic 
camp is required for 
enrollment in the ROTC 




advanced course. "How- 
ever," LTC Munson add- 
ed, "veterans normally 
receive credit for the 
basic course based on 
their prior service, and 
can enter directly into 
the advanced course." 

LTC Munson will be 
interviewing prospective 
candidates for the sum- 
mer program until 1 
April 1976. Students in- 
terested in basic camp 
and the advanced course 
should call him at 
422-7808. "| 

will be happy to talk 
about the two-year pro- 
gram. It has several 



advantages and benefits 
that I think many stu- 
dents will be interested 

Basic camp cadets 
are paid about $500.00 for 
the six weeks of training. 
While at basic camp they 
also receive free room 
and board and are 
reimbursed for trans- 
portation to and from 
Fort Knox. 

Students in the ad- 
vanced course are paid 
5)00.00 each month of the 
school year and upon 
graduation are commis- 
sioned as second lieuten- 
ants in the U.S. Army.
