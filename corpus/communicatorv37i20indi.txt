According to (he Historj (h.in- 
ncl, one legend stales that St. Val- 
entine was a priest who performed 
secret wedding ceremonies during a 
marriage ban in third century Rome. 

It is also suggested (hut he may 
have helped people escape' Roman 
prisons where torture was common- 
place. Others believe thai St Valen- 
tine himself sent the iirsi Valentine 
to a young girl with whom he was 
in love, signing his greeting, "From 
your Valentine." 

Whatever the true Story behind 
this man, by the Middle Ages, he Was 
one of the most popular sainls in Eu- 

But it wasn't until the 19th cen- 
tury that British settlers brought Val- 
entine's Day to North America. 

In 1847, llic liisl mass- produced 
Valentines were sold and exchanged. 
and by the middle of the 19(H)s, gift 
giving was extended from |ust greet- 
ing cards to jewelry. Dowers and can- 
dy. 

Such emphasis on materialism is 
what IPFW sophomore Jennifer Wat- 
kins dislikes the most about Feb. 14. 
"Valentine's is a commercial holi- 
day," she said. "Il is sigmlicant to 
some, but I believe it's mainly to 
pMlii the paper companies and candv 
companies. I think it's Overrated." 

In the Uniled States alone some 
IK8 million cards, excluding cards 
exchanged among children in class- 
rooms, are given on Valentine's Day 
each year. In 201)6. it was estimated 
that consumers spent $1 3.7 billion on 
cards and gifts.

Darfur still needs American support

Ever since the Holocaust we 
have heard the phrase 'never again,' 
and the United Nations was estab- 
lished in part to sec (o it that that slo- 
gan would become a reality. 

"The reality is that we have wit- 
nessed untold cases of brutality 
which neither the U.S. nor the U.N. 
has done much about it," said IPFW 
assistant professor ol political sci- 
ence and peace and conflict studies 
Elliot Banky. 

In the world there are many con- 
llicls that affect and sometimes dev- 
astate societies, one of which exists 

For over three years the Suda- 
nese government and militia known 
as Janjawecd has killed over 400,000 
people and has expelled more than 2 
million innocent people from their

"The suffering of the population 
is rooted in local conditions of con- 
Diet between a nomadic people and a 
farming people which, from a mate- 
rial point of view, is irrelevant to the 
USA," said Bartky. 

Even though this issue has been 
going on lor years there are still many 
changes that need to happen.

USA into debates about the crisis in 
Darfur. Yet materially speaking, the 
horror that is Darfur has no relation- 
ship to the everyday life of Ameri- 
cans," said Bartky. 

A possibility for uninvolvement 
among Americans is that it is difficult 
to be involved when uninformed. 

Many nations are in a similar posi- 
tion. "The African Union has a mea- 
ger force incapable of doing much on 
the ground to prevent the massacre 
taking place in Sudan, and while the 
U.N. recognizes the humanitarian di- 
saster as il unfolds, neither the U.S. 
nor the U.N. has so far demonstrated 
the will to overcome the support, 
tacit or direct, which Sudan receives, 
especially from many Arab nations 
and China. The lack of willingness 
to think about or act is not confined 
our government or the U.N.," said 
Bartky. 

Awareness is a cause for concern 
for informing future generations. 

With so much going on, college 
students may find it difficult to fit 
Darfur in their list of things for which 
to fight. 

"On college campuses around the 
country the same groups that organize 
to demonstrate against the war in Iraq 
are typically silent about Darfur. Per- 
haps the anti-war groups are not tak-

It was right before gift-giving 
became a holiday trademark that a 
reminder of one's existence and rec-

the thought that counts," I assume, 
is a saying started not on birthdays 
(we have a right to say "this pres- 
ent sucks" on our birthdays), not on 
Christmas (thanks to the receipt, the 
gift return is a harmless gesture of 
gilt hatred), but on Valentine's Day, 
due to forgetful pressures of quick 
homemade presents that come from

when all retail stores are Hooded with

yond belief. Although I do like the 
Iradilion of Valentine's Day (when 
we were younger, it gave us another 
reason for a class party), I do think 
that Valentine's Day has become 
too commercialized. I don't think 
that gianls like Hallmark have seen 
the waste of paper and candy that I 

Yes. I work in retail. I have for 
many years and seeing the after- 
math of waste thai goes iinpuri based 
makes me sad. We could be using 
those resources to feed and clothe the 
homeless, hnd a cure for AIDS, help 
orphans in Third World countries or 
SOMETHING more practical than 
things thai end up sitting in grocery 
stores, and even worse, the mall. 

Valentine's Day is supposed to he 
a day for spending time with loved 
ones. I used to make my mom cards. 
Whatever happened to just having a 
party in school with the paper mail- 
boxes everyone made thai contained 
some Valentine's and candy, and then 
calling it a day? I remember a sim- 
pler tune, v. hen Vale nil lie's Day con-

make sure I had every pink and red 
bit of clothing in my closet on my 
body for school lliat day. hi class, we 
all sat around and pretended to pay 
attention so that we could have our 
parly and listen to music. 

Why is it that when you "grow 
up," Valentine's Day becomes this 
massive weight on your shoulders 
of "what do I gel my hoytrieud/ 
girlfriend." or "why do I nol have a 
boyfriend/girlfriend?" It was espe- 
cially bad in high school, because the 
school [ attended had a carnation sale- 
each year for Valentine's Day. 

We could buy flowers and have 
them scni to anyone in the school

It didn't mailer who got one. but 
looking back, it hurl their feelings, 
and made them sad. Clearly, this is

like the bunny in a Greyhound race

Have you ever had one of those 
days where you really — and I'm talk-

by an ATM but. instead of filling your 
pockets, ihc ATM spits oui a receipt 
thai says, "Try again, sucker! You 
ain't got no money." (Think of Ed-

you read lhal lasl line. If you haven't

have no interest in other gifts and 
so there is no reason to try. This, for 
most women, is noi true Although 
we don't want a used Valentine's card

For most part Valentine's Day is 
not even about the gifts, but about

Where is the 'spring' in Spring Break? 



It's hallway ihnnigh February and 
I think most people are ready for win- 
ter to be over. I know I am. I've had 
enough ot ihc snow, bitter cold winds, 
and Mother Nature nut making up her 
mind on just how horrible it will or 
will not be. Today it's fairly dccciu 
outside. We have mid-30s weather 
and it snowed last night. 

In a mere few weeks, it will be 
Spring Break for students here on 
campus and I wonder, will it even 
be spring? Even though most col- 
lege students go somewhere warm 
lor Spring Break, lhal isn't die point 
of it, which is to enjoy spring where 
you live. I think it's a tad ridiculous 
that our Spring Break keeps gelling 
pushed further and further into Ihe 
winter months. 

When we were younger, we had 
Spring Break the week atler Easier 
(although I think thai was a ploy so 
that our teachers didn't have to deal 
with us hopped up on candy--lhe 



same reason we always got the days 
oft atler Halloween tor [all Break I, 
noi in the beginning of March. 

In some other stales, a Spring 
Break in Ihc first week of March 

in Northern Indiana early March is

Besides, when you wait io enjoy 
oilier plates of the country or world 
for l.uer in ihe year, you have more 
choices. I weni lo Wisconsin for In- 
dependence Day last year and il was 
beautiful. 

You can't exactly enjoy cold 
places for Spring Break, unless of 
course, you're going skiing or snow- 
boarding on a mountain somewhere 
And if you live in Indiana, and you 
go lo a ski resort for Spring Break 
more power to you, bui I think 

So I ask you. 1PFW. why can't we 



ha\L- a spring break in spring.' I know 
that it probably has lo do with how 
the weeks of the semester fall, bui I 
can't help thinking about how much 
more people would enjoy their week 
long freedom when it is actually nice 
outside. 

I think that many -indents would 
come back more refreshed from a 
week of sun, warmth and freedom 
from homework and classes, instead 
ol returning to scrape windows of 
llieir Iro/cu vehicles, which require 
twenty minutes to warm up. What 
kind of a Spring Break is that, any- 

Now, after writing all ol ibis down 
it will be my luck that our week off 
from school will be uncommonly 
beauiitu!, the sun w ill shine and the 
birds will sing just to prove that it 
isn't too early in the year. 

Mother Nature has a weird way 
ot working like that Perhaps I should 
lake a step back to be patient, 
hopetul lhal for once we will have 
nice weather come Spring Break and 
pray lhal ihe snow gods will be nice

Daylight drops like it's hot 



By Said EI-Dajani 
Managing Editor 



In an industn where space is lim- 
ited uiid cohesiveiicss is key, I met 
a band of guys who empio_\ all the 
right elements ol a successful travel- 
ing band. 

Dropping Dajlight. a piano rock 
group approvimaling the sounds of 
Ben Folds and Hawthorne Heights, 
has spent the last lour years touring 
and growing closer together. 

"Touring is a really difficult life- 
style to find happiness in. and it's not 
something thai evei &gt; body can do for 
years and years." explained pianist 
and vocalist Sebastian Davin, in ref- 
erenee to letting gool iheir old ilnim-

Ins unorthodox approach to matur-

to say whether or not that has made 
Selh grow up faster or if Sctti was go- 
ing to grow up faster anyway." 

I could tell by Sebastian's elo- 
quence and verbal command that 
song writing wasn't a burden but a 
combination of poetry and intelli- 
gence. 

These guys were informed and 
constantly collaborating, whether it

Fort Wayne Philharmonic showcases Romantic masterpieces 



By Louisa Danielson 

On Jan. 27, Fort Wayne Phil- 
harmonic performed works by 
Beethoven, Brahms and von Weber 
to the enjoyment of a fairly full Em- 
bassy Theater. 

The concert opened with von 
Weber's "Overture lo "Obcron,"' 
an opera that initially starred Char- 
lemagne. Puck (from "A Midsi ner 

Night's Dream") and two mermaids. 
A gentle r-ieiiLh horn melody opened 
the piece, followed h\ muled strings 
that ereseendoed into a fantastic wa- 
terfall of descending scales. Pulsing 
rhythms, a glorious ihunder of notes 
and an exciting linish completed this 

Weber's greatest triumphs. A portion

hurri silver medalist Joyce Vang, per- 
torming Beethoven's "Piano Concer- 
to No. 3 in C minor." The youngest 
competilor at the 12th Van Cliburn

this Korean-born pianist played Willi

music with her delicate interpreta-

peggios ,md tango-like rhythms in the 
lirst movement. The second move- 
ment was a calm before the storm 
of chromatics and grace notes in the 



third movement. Yang's shimmering 
violet gown and Hashing silver shoes 
lent animation lo her style, catching 
the spotlight during animated mo- 
ments of the music. 

Following several bows and a 
standing ovation from the audience. 
Yang reentered the stage. "Thank 
you! That -" Yang looked over ihe 
orchestra and back to the audience. 

She approached the piano and an- 
nounced an encore piece, "'My Joys," 
transcribed by Liszt for piano. This 
piece was a conglomeration of thick 
chords and trailing double scales that 
held both orchestra and audience 
members spellbound. 

Following an intermission, the or- 
chestra played Brahms' "'Symphony 



No. 3 in F major." Despite

Killswitch Engage revitalizes metal 



By Mike Webb 

Arts &amp; Entertainment Editor 



Since 1999, Killswitch Engage 
has been honing their metal core 
chops and carving a name for them- 
selves among those who like their 
music extremely loud. With their 
in-your-face approach. Killswitch 
Engage lias garnered respect among 
metal fans, many of whom consider 
them as carrying the torch since the 
demise of the mighty Pantera. 

Currently consisting of Howard 
Jones (vocals). Adam Dutkicwicz 
(guitar). Joel Stroetzel (guitar). Mike 
D'Antonio (bass) and Justin Riley 
(drums), Ihe band has not lost their in- 
tensity and passion, even though they 
have losl original members along ihe 

The release of "As Daylight 
Dies" marks the band's fourth studio 
recording and their third on Road- 
runner Records. Currently thriving 
on llie success of its hrst single "My 
Curse," this new record is a dramatic 
leap forward in terms of song-craft- 



mg m.ituritv. for a band that was al- 
ready considered by many to be the 
best in their respective genre. 

"As Daylight Dies" can be called 
the album of riffs. There is a strong 
emphasis on making ihe songs mem- 
orable rather than just brutally heavy. 
The majority of the songs are actually 
mid-tempo melalcorc songs. Since 
the band has a history of playing last- 
tempo metal songs, we arc left to as- 
sume that this choice was an inten- 
tional one and not a matter of lacking 
musical chops. In fact, never have 
their chops been more apparent. 

Worth particular mention is vo- 
calist Howard Jones "As Dayhghl 
Dies" marks his second record with 
Ihe hand, which should put lo rest any 
doubts that fans may have had about 
his vocal prowess up to this point. If 
it's possible, his screams arc tasteful 
and powerful. On the other hand, his 
clean vocals are tight and add a touch 
of soul, which draws the obvious par- 
allels lo another similar, but argu.ibU 
less heavy, band Sevendust. 

The songs here are as melodic 
as heavy music can get, which only 
serves to add beautj to the songs. I he 



fact that tins band can lake something 
potentially piercing lo the ears and 
make it not only respectable, but also 
memorable, is a testament lo their ar- 
tistic prowess. 

The band's sole Focus is not power 
chords. Dutkicwicz actually attended 
the prestigious Berklce School of 
Music in Boston before forming 
Killswitch Engage. He is also the 
band's former drummer, a testament 
to his versatility. Whenever Berklce 
is mentioned within a band's biogra- 
phy, they are worth looking into. 

Standout tracks on this record 
include "This is Absolution," which 
brings to mind hints of Hawthorne 
Heights crossed with the brutality of 
Trivium. and "The Arms of Sorrow." 
with its complex, drum pattern layered 
underneath mid-tempo monstrous 
guitar riffs. These Iwo songs arc the 
second and third tracks respectively, 
so right away you know this is an al- 
bum that is worth a fair listen. 

"As Daylighi Dies" cements the 
band's position among Trivium, Be- 
coming ihe Archetype and Avenged 
.Sevenfold as [he metal bands worth 
watching these days.
