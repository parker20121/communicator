''Cool Hand Luke" 
slated jor March 11 

On March 11 Ciiclc K will, tor Ihe 
Student Aid Fund Thealer. fealufe 
"Cool Hand Luke". 

The Sludcnl Aid Fund a used for 
providing schnlBTBliips for deserving 
students. There is a need at the pre- 
sent for a scholarship fund which 
c^n be u.&lt;u!d without aK much "red 
tape" as in other Kholarship systems. 

Students receiving the aid would 
be mainly from low income level 
families but income would not be 
the only consideration or require- 
ment. Money raised from the 
theater will be turned over to the 
Student Aid Fund to be distri- 
buted to deserving students. 

The featured movie tor the Maich 
II theater, "Cool Hand Luke," is a 
film starring Paul Newman, George 
Kennedy, Jo Van Fleet, and directed 
by Stuait Rosenberg. The movie's 
setting is In the deep South. The 
story centers on a harshly disci- ' 
plined chain-gang and the prisoner 
Luke who must defy any system 
which seeks to limit his personal 
freedom. 

Newman's portrayal of Luke won 
an Academy Award nomination for 
best actor, and co-star George 
Kennedy won the Academy Award 
for the best supporting actor. 

The critics seemed to like the 
film as Judith Crist on NBC-TV 
Mid, "Newman's portrayBl...a 
stringently contemporBty screenplay, 
and.. .sharp rhythmic direction. ..give 
(the film) a pertinence and disllnc- 
llon..." Bosley Crowther in the 
New York Times said of the cast, 
"Paul Newman Is superb in this 
forceful portrait of a man born to 
lose. ..totally untaultable cast.,." 

Circle K will present this motion 
picture on Saturday, March 11 in 
room 107. The movie will be 
shown at 2 p.m. 4:30 p.m., 7, and 
9:30 p.m. Admission will be $1 
per person for adults and $.50 for 
children. The Student Aid Fund 
needs your help.

COMMUNICATOR 



Interview with Dean Gilbert 



The following is » portion of an 
interview with De»n James Gilbert con- 
ducted by COMMUNICATOR staff 
Teport«T John Logan. Other excerpts of 
[hit Interview will be Included in future 

Q. To start would you describe the 
emphasis of Purdue's program at the 
regional campus? 

A. Arc you conscious of the term 
"academic mission"? 
Q. Could you explain it? 
A. When Purdue and Indiana came 
about, when the marriage was con- 
sumated and blc&amp;sed by the Board of 
Trustees and the child was delivered 
there was a problem. The child had 
two head&amp;. It was a Siamese twin. 
The trustees performed surgery on the 
child and assigned some academic 
missions to Purdue and seme to I.U. 
For example. Purdue teaches biology 
and Indiana teaches sociology, 
(j. Would you say, then, that the 
academic missions of the two univer- 
sities al the regional campus are drawn 
up atone the lines of emphasis of 
Lafayette and Bloomlngton? 
A. Yes, the fact that Purdue is named 
for John Purdue covers over the fact 
that the school really could be called 
Indiana ASiM (Agriculture and Mechan- 
ics). 

Q. As long as the present situation 
cxlsU with Indiana and Purdue at the 
same campus there will probably will 
not be any change in Purdue's academic 
mission here, then? 
A. No, they're fairly well known in 
terms of academic mission. 
Q. Do you definitely sec autonomy 
coming to Purdue at Fort Wayne? 
A. Yes, definitely. It's coming In 
SepU-mber of 1973. That's on immut- 
able law. As far as how it's going to 
be worked out we all have interesting 
questions to ask. But we're going to 
gel autonomy of some kind~not inde- 
pendence but autonomy. There's a 
little bit of difference there. We could 
make our own decisions about the 
academic aspects about curriculum and 
these kinds of things. 
Q, What do you foresee as the effect 
that autonomy will have on this cam- 

A. After both I.U. and Purdue attain 
autonomy at this campus I sec us pro- 
ducing maybe a Fort Wayne curriculum 
where it really wouldn't matter in a 
sense which university a student would 
get his degree from. I think we could 
work towards a much closer relation- 
ship between the two universities in 
terms of how they affect the students. 
Basically, the student doesn't care 
about academic mission. What differ- 
ence does it make? He wants the 
course. He wants the subject matter. 
Students do care about what Institu- 
tions they get their degrees from and 
there Ls reasonableness to that. Pur- 
due has 3 much better reputation in 
engineering, for example, than Indiana 
has and Indiana tias a much better 
reputation In music. So if I were 
getting a degree in music I would 
want it from I.U. With autonomy 1 
do see a change coming about. When 
wc get it we can make some of the 
curriculum decisions we have to make 
here and not be bound as ne arc to 
the mother campuses. 
Q. Wtut do you see as the goats 
of Purdue University at Fort Wayne? 
A. The whole thing about goats and 
objectives is a very shaky one because 
you're meeting the needs of all sorts 
of different people. The university 
has to t&gt;e respon^ve to the students 
and to the faculty and to the commun- 
ity In which it exists. I'm going to 
gin you my personal perceptions. 



These might not be shared by all the 
other constituents here. This is ovet- 
simplined and quite gross in the tax- 
onomy that I'm going to use in terms 
of describing it. 

The overall goal of the university is 
very simple to state. 

What we're supposed to be douig 
a facilitating teaming. We're supposed 
to be helping students learn more 
effectively and efficiently in particular 
subject areas. Another way to look at 
that is to say, "O.K., what are you 
about?" If you'll buy the fact that 
the university is supposed to aid stu- 
dents in making their learning a little 
more efficient and effective and to 
make it a tittle easier tor them to learn 
things, and structure it a little more, 
we can think of three things. 

The first of them is knowledge. 
We would like our students when they 
leave the institution to have more 
knowledge than when they came in. 
more knowledge about a tot of differ- 
ent things. More knowledge about 
where to get more knowledge. Your 
learning is not going to stop when you 
leave this institution, it's going to go 
on the rest of your life. From cradle 
to grove an individual changes his be- 
havior and what we'd like to do for 
that individual is to provide some 
skills so that he can carry on that 
process himself. 

The second area Is skills. We'd 
like to be able to look at a student 
and say' "Hey, he can do this whole 
constellation of different kinds of 
things." That constellation might in- 
clude anything from playing golf to 
working out the third law of thermal 
dynamics with a mathematical model. 

The third goal is probably the most 
important. It Is to somehow, in some 
way have any students be concerned 
enough about applying the knowledge 
and skills they have acquired to chang- 
ing society in a positive direction. 

Opinion of reader 
opinion 

Dear Editors: 

The approach taken by Cathryn 
Levison to the abortion contro- 
versy is certainly one of more en- 
lightenment and rationale than those 
frequently expressed by other view- 
points and was a welcome relief 
from the emotionally sensational 
pieces recently published by the 
COMMUNICATOR. 

However, while Levison's letter 
was perhaps more logically pre- 
sented and cohesive than certain 
commentaries, several points were 
stated with which issue can, and 
should, be taken. 

Levlson suggests that there is a 
dermite correlation between un- 
wanted children and those chil- 
dren who are abused or battered. 
She further states that parents who 
are not desirous of having children 
do not display the usual affectionate 
attachment characteristic of parents. 
While these assertions are no doubt 
correct, the assumption that such 
conditions preclude circumstances 
under which an abused or un- 
wanted child would be better off 
dead is falacious. 

Certainly, the fact that a chUd 
may be destined to suffer a dif- 
ficult lite does not mean that the 
child should be prevented from lite. 
Mere human iatelllgence, in all Its 
fallibility, cannot hope to determine 
when a child would be more for- 
tunate to die than to live. 

It ii likewise difficult to accept 
Levison^ statement that "for the 
ake of the diitd, I am not In favor 



of compulsory pregnancy." Under- 
standably, compulsory pregnancy is 
an unfortunate situation for a woman 
to face. Yet. abortion is more than 
unfortunate, for it is much more 
consequential. 

Pregnancy, while uncomfortable and 
painful, and perhaps inconvenient as 
well, is of short duration. Nine months 
of incapacitation may seem an eternity 
to the pregnant woman, but eventually, 
the nine months are over and the woman 
is free of the burden of carrying the 
child. With the alternative of adoption, 
the woman is free of the child for the 
rest of her life. 

Pregnancy does not last forever, but 
abortion is brevocable. Once an abortion 
is performed, the effect Upon the fetus 
endures for inFmity, and no amends can 
be made. Pregnancy may well be in- 
voluntary servitude for some women, but 
abortion is nothing less than pre-natal 
homicide. Hence, Levison's stand that 
she Is "tor the sake of the child" is not 
easily reconcilable with her stand on 
abortion. 

Undeniably women have the right 
to control their own bodies,, but Ihey 
cannot in justice control the bodies of 
others, even if those other bodies arc con- 
tained within their own. All people Kave 
the right to follow the dictates of a free 
will, but when that will infringes upon 
the right of another to live, the freedom 
to carry out the will ceases. Subsequently, 
no one has the right to destroy life, 
even that life which is existent in a child 
yet unborn.

Commentary 

March S at 7:30 in Room 107 the 
State Commission for higher educa- 
tion will visit the local campus to 
solicit' citizens' opinions regarding fu- 
ture directions in higher education in 
Indiana. 

Students may present opinions at 
this forum. The Commission, created 
by the General Assembly, is empowered 
&gt;i ■ sort of board of regents to prepare 
B master plan for higher education. 

Matters regarding degree require- 
ments, local campus autonomy, dual 
bureaucracy, attendance requirements 
at the main campuses, credit for first 



March 3. 1972 

year language requirements, academic 
bankruptcy, and the untenable increaw 
in costs for students are some of the 
issues which need be raised by studenti 
at this meeting. 



If students who purchased B park- 
ing stickers withhold their money 
next semester and buy gravel instead, 
perhaps the B lots will not be the 
scene of autos sunk in mud up to 
the windows. Two years of paid 
parking have resulted in no increase 
of services to students in parking facil- 
ities. The university should be able to 
afford a little gravel for its overpriced 
parking facihties. 



February Slst students met in 
Bloomlngton to attempt to pursuade 
Indiana University to give credit tor 
one hundred level language courses. 
The courses represent a large expense 
tor students and result in no 
credit toward graduation. 

Many students simply take degrees 
in education or business in order to 
avoid the language requirement. 
Power to allow credit for first year 
language courses rests with the College 
of Arts and Sciences In Bloomlngton.

'Seven Samurai' today 



"Seten Samurai", the nim of the 
WMk of the W Film Seriw, ii tenned 
IS one of Ihe pestcst films in the 
career of lU director, Arkira Kurosawa. 
In any ranking of the world's great 
nim directors Kurosawa caaly places 
in the company of Bergman, Fellini, 
Aiitonioni, Renoir, Godatd, and 
Welles. In the opinion of Donald 
Richie, author nf The Films of Arkira 
KU[0«ira. "Seven Samurai", is "not 
only Kurosawa's most vital picture, 
It is also perhaps Ihe best Japanese 
film ever made." 

The action takes place in 16th 
century Japan, In a snail farming 
vHlage, Year after year, marauding 
bandits have raided the community, 
taking their crops and Ihcir women. 
The village elder decides that the

Campus reveals 
growth statistics 

In a recent study undertaken to 
delcrmlnc Ihe growth factor of 
Indiana University at Fort Wayne, 
it was revealed thai degrees granted 
In 1971 numbered nearly five times 
those conferred only tour years 
earlier In i96B. Last year, 527 
degrees were granted as opposed to 
U3 in 1968. The figures were re- 
leased this week by Neil Lantz, 
registrar. 

A cross-section indicates that in 
I96B, 24 student received the 
Associate in Science degree offered 
by dental hygiene and the Division 
of General and Technical Studies. 
Five Bachelor of Arts degrees 
were granted and 84 Bachelor of 
Science degrees in business, educa- 
tion and medical technology. That 
was [he year degrees were fir^l 
granted at Indiana University here 
and the first commencement was 
held. Formerly, students seeking 
degrees were obliged to com- 
plete their studies in Bloomington. 

Only four academic years later, 
96 Associate In Science degrees 
were awarded; 37 A.B. degrees and 
236 B.S. degrees. In addition 21 
persons received the Master of 
Science degree in business and 135 
were granted the M.S. degree in 
education. This year, some 60D 
paduaUs of degree programs arc 
expected to complete their studies 
at [U here. 

Growth ttirough theyears has 
been steady. In 1968, 113 per- 
sons received degrees; in I9G9, 
224; in 1970, 384; and in 1971, 
627. Most of the growth Is 
attributed to expanded programs 
and faculty and the addition of the 
master's degree program in 1970. 



APO MEETS SUNDAY 

There will be an informal APO 
meeting this Sunday. March 5, at 
7:00 p.m. in Room 107. All mem- 
bers are to attend. 

The students are reminded that 
these meetings are open to them,

dent. 



the bandits' attacks. As Ihe victori- 
ous samurai leave the village, they 
realize that Ihe farmers were Ihe 
real victors in the battle. 

Kurosawa's ample development oi 
this narrative commands respect. 
Each samurai is given a distinctive, 
memorable personality, ranging from 
the phlegmatic Kambel (Takashl 
Shimura) lo the volatile, reckles, 
but utterly engaging Kikuchiyo 
(Toshiro Mifune), Their fearlessness 
and their zest for battle inspire the 
villagers. The samurai Tight for 
three meager meals a day and for the 
sheer exhilaration of defeating the 
plunderers of society. It is scarcely 
surprising that Kurosawa so admires 
the cinema of John Ford or that 
"Seven Samurai" was re-made by 
John Sturges (under Ihe title "The 
Magnificent Seven" with Yul Brynner 
and Steve McQueen) in a Western 
setting. 

One critic states that, "In 'Seven 
Samurai", Ihe greatest bailie epic 
since "The Birth of a Nation" of 
1915, Kurosawa achieves what modern 
American and European pic makers 
vainly attempt: the excitement of 
the senses. Laurence Olivier had 
charged the screen with glorious ex- 
ultation in "Henry V"; Kurosawa 
makes this exultation his theme. 
Fighting itself is the sub)ecl of 
"Seven Samurai"-&lt;an epic on vio- 
lence and action, a raging, sensuous 
work of such overpowering immediacy 
that it leaves you both exhilarated 
and exhausted, . ." 

The feature will be shown on 
Friday, March 3 at 4:30, 7, and 
9:30 p.m. and ts free to faculty and 
student activity card holders. Be- 
cause of the length of Ihe film, the 
showings will begin promptly. 

Volunteer tetichers sought 

Earl Cummings of the Chain-0-Lahes 
Youth Camp visited lU-PU Wednesday 
in an attempt to recruit students to 
work as volunteer teachers at the camp. 

The camp is an institution of the 
Indiana Department of Corrections. 
Cummings, a resident teacher at the 
camp, said that volunteers will work 
with groups of three or tour inmates 
to prepare them for the high school 
equivalency examination (G.E.D.) 

An Important service that volun- 
teers fulfill Is simply to provide in- 
mates wilh dialogue from persons who 
are on the outside. 

Students who are interested in 
participating in the program should 
contact Scott Gillie In Room G-5 
for further infarniation.

The third lesson at Khools Is a 
compensatory leeson. The lesson 
leaches that individual identity is 
achieved through Tollowing the 
ethic or individualism. It is compen- 
ulory in that this leuon Is an 
attempt to counteract the forces ot 
alienation. The lesson teaches that 
the suffering and Involuntary servi- 
tude imposed by thi^ schools has an 
end: Individual success. 

This lesson, as in the case of the 
Icffions of absurdity and hate, is not 
designed by curriculum planners. 
The lesson is learned primarily from 
the form of the oducationa) process 
(as opposed to the content). 

Individualism, of course, docs 
not originate in the schools. In- 
dividualism is aif clement ot Ameri- 
can culture which pervades our 
folklore. Americans often have 
prided themselves as a nation of 
"rugged IndlviduaUsts," American

acts revealed 

lU survey 






The day when higher education 
was thought of solely as the special 
province of the rscent high school 
graduate appears to be a thing of 
the past. In these times when learn- 
ing is a continual process from cra- 
dle to itrave, older students are 
matriculating back to college in ever 
Incieasing numbers. 

A recent survey of the students 
enrolled at Indiana University at 
Foil Wayne for the fall semester, 
1971-72, reveals some eye-opening 
fBcl:, The most startling one, per- 
haps Is [hat students 21 years of 
age and older are by far in the ma- 
jority of those 20 and under. Stu- 
ilents in (he latter age group num- 
bered 1,236 white those 21 and up 
numbered 2,2B8. The youngest 
students were 17 with II enrolled 
and the oldest age group were over 
60 with 34 registered. StudenU who 
were 19 represented the largest 
single age group with 472 enrolled. 
A further bredkdowo reveals there 
were 1,688 sti:dents aged 21-30; 
469 StudenU from 31-45; and 
97 students aged 46-58. Most 
students in all age brackets listed 
their residence as being In ,.he 
following counties: Adams, Allen, 
DeKalb, Huntington, Kosciusko, 
Koble, Wells, and Whitley. 

The reason most older students 
avail themselves of the educational 
opportunity at lU here is to take 
advantage of the university's gradu- 
ate degree programs in business and 
education which atttact industry 
uid teachers. Still others are pur- 
suing education for the sheer joy 
of leaning. It Just goes to prove 
the old axiom- "You're never too 
old to learn." 



history consistently emphasizes the 
achievement of Individuals apart from 
the poup contexts (which enabled 
the achievements). Our music and 
literature are repositories of heroic 
exploits. 

Individualism is almost always 
mentioned in connection with Its 
positive attributes: strong character, 
pioneer spirit, toughness (can't be 
pushed around), industrialism, em- 
pire building, and perpetual rags to 
riches sagas. 

Usually overlooked is the rootless- 
ness, the escapism, the selfishness, 
and the subjugation of individuals 



s the n 



s to o 



Texaco has a right to pollute (they 
won't be pushed around). 

The hesitancy of American society 
to discourage real threats of annihi- 
lation is not only a result of vested 
Interests but also a result of a pro- 
perly based fear of closing off the 
only possible path to identity. Nega- 
tive aspects of individualism are 
hidden by a cultural myopia and a 
subconscious reaUzation that the 
negative must be accepted with the 
positive or the whole ethic collapses. 

It Isn't necessary in this article 
to dwell upon the fact that indivi- 
dualism is antithetical to the crea- 
tion of genuine community. One 
cunent example of the destructive- 
ness of individualism to community is 
evidenced in the counter-culture. 
The counter-culture has adopted 
superficial styles which do not re- 
flect the dominant culture. How- 
ever, the concepts of the counter- 
culture are fundamentally derived 
from the mainstream. Specifically, 
"do your own thing" is suspiciously 
reminiscent of "rugged individualism." 
Attempts at establishing community 
within the counter-culture suffer 
from the same built-in limitation to 
community as the dominant culture. 
In this respect, the counter-culture 
is not "counter" at all but a reaction- 
ary element within the donr^nant 
culture. 

The ethic of individualism is 
supported and transmitted through the 
schools. Each student sits at his desk, 
doing his lesson, pursuing his own 
success. The silent message is 
learned. "The world is an ugly fight 
for survival; If you're going to make 
It, youYe going to have to do it on 
your own." Many students may 
remember teachers advising them not 
to give the answers to a friend l&gt;e- 
cause it will "only hurt your own 
grade." The resounding voice of a 
teacher saying to help someone is 
to hurt that person: "No one will 
be there to help him in the real 
world." 

"No one will be there to help 
him in the real world." This state- 
ment is as much prophecy as it is 
statement of fact. Not only does 
the student learn that he can't de- 
pend upon others, he learns that he, 
himself, is not really expected to 
assist anyone. 

Teaching machines and indivi- 
dualized instruction, tiighly touted 
educational reforms, ignore the es- 
tranging effects of individualism. 

The student whose self is butch- 
ered, whose spirit is reduced 
through molding and processjng 
lewns the key to identity in Ameri- 



can culture: a person is nobody 
except a compilation of valued 
goods, succefi. To become some- 
one, anyone, an individual accumu- 
lates his own car, his own home, 
his own bathroom, his own bedroom, 
ad infinitum. The ecological conse- 
quences are frightening and evident. 
God help us if elephants become 
valued status symtiols. 

Unfortunately for the creation 
of a clear argument, the ethic of 
individualism coexists with other 
values, some of them contrary to 
individualism. It Is fortunate that 
the ethic ot individualism Is temp- 
ered by these values. The student, 
however, is caught in the crossrire. 
America has a tradition of sharing, 
charity, and generosity. It is 
questionable that the tradition has 
ever coincided with reality; however, 
the tradition has been around and 
is around to complicate the lite ot 
a student. 

The charitable values do not 
balance the life of a student caught 
up in the individualist struggle- 
they confuse it by making contra- 
dictory demands upon the student. 
The path to identity is strewn with 
obstacles: fair play, sharing, getting 
along with the group. 

(Community, the source of 
identity and meaning for social 
beings, is deprecated through school- 
ing. The pursuit of the individual- 
ist ethic is the ultimate alienating 
force in American culture. This 
force or dynamic is central in Ameri- 
can culture. The previously dis- 
cussed attributes of alienation are 
secondary elements in the sxstciD 
of alienation in American culture 
the final products ot which are in- 
dividuals alienated from their fellow 

Ultimately individuals retreat 
seeking privacy {following the indivi- 
dualist ethic). Fhiltip Slater terms 
this the pursuit of loneliness. The 
retreat to privacy further undermines 
community, and the cycle of indivi- 
dualism recreates itself.

Yes, they're leaving most of their 
clothci OT) in PIT theatre this time. 
But so as not to destroy their Inugc, 
PIT has rnHnafed to dirty "Ttrlutte" 
up a bit. 

Tirtuffe (Larry Life} is not your 
run-ot -Ihe-mill dirty old num. He's 
got class. In spile of his cross-waving 
pieties, the man Is a classic hypocrite. 
Tarlurfe has &gt; hang-up on a couple 
of things. 

Supposedly a ChiUtian, Tartuffe 
lusts after lovely Elmire (Sharon 
Gabct). [n (he scene where Elmire 
traps Tartufre Into playing his hand, 
while her husband Orjon (David Thomp- 
son) Is In hiding. Tarlutfe displays his 
true self. During his celebration over 
what he thought was a show of 
Elmire's lovi', he slates that "Heaven 
Is not averse to compTomisc" and 
that wrongful acts may be redeemed 
by purity of intention. Then Tirtuffe 
elucidates the hypoeritic oath: "And 
there's no evil till the act is known; 
It's scandal Madam, which makes It 
an offense. And it's no sin to sin in 
confidence," 

'Tartuftc" is a comedy by Mollere on 
hypocrisy. Funny to read, in FIT's grasp 
It becomes even better. The play leaves 
Itself wide open to interpretation. Be- 
cause of the direction of Dr. Daniel 
Cashman, and the inspired performance 
of the cast, It is a joy lo behold. 

Through the clever use of music, 
Di. Cashman squeezes out more ro- 
bust laughs than the script commands. 
When combined with decorative period 
costuming, a well-done set and great 
acting, a humorous play becomes a 
hilarious comedy. 



A Preview of "Tartuffe" 



by Mark Souder 



The play's opening lags a bit 
primarily due to Mollere. In- 
spite of a good performance by 
Carohne Zook as the paternal- 
istic grandmother, it isn't until 
the exchange between Orgon 
and Dorine (Susan GliKebrook) 
concerning the health of the fam- 
ily and Tartuffe that the pace 
picks up. 

While one silly grin from David 
Thompson can steal the audience's 
attention, Susan Glazebrook's 
Dorine is superb. Dorine Is a 
snipping little maid, and much of 
the written comedy is hers. Su- 
san does it well. Though some- 
times I thought she looked pret- 
tier with her mouth shut, her 
sterling performance amas^ and 
astounded me. 

One of Dorine 's major con- 
cerns was the faltering love af- 
fair between Marianne (Pam Jen- 
sen) and Valere (Doug WyUe). 
Orgon, Marianne's father, having 
been thoroughly duped by the 
treachery of the parasite, Tartuffe, 
desired to marry oft Marianne to 
him. Pam Jensen plays a fine 
gooey-eyed lovee, and Doug Wy- 
lle is appropriately cast as the 
overeager lover. 

Orgon's son, Damis, is played 
by Richard Knccht, who is better 
as the revengeful brother than he 
was as the piano-playing Schroeder 
In "Clharlie Brown." He longs to 
powder Tartuffe with the result 
that his duped father strips him 
of his inheritance and gives it all 
to Tartuffe. 



Cleante (John Brcnnan) is more 
rational about the situation. He's 
the play's philosopher king. It's 
ironic that it's played by Prof. 
Brennan. He's in bad company 
when he's alone. As the play's 
old man among the young upstarts, 
he's badly in need of an acting 
class (he asked for it). 

As all the play's releases say, 
Elmire is played by "Sharon Gabet 
of Miss Fort Wayne 1970 tame." 
Sharon plays your typical t&gt;eauty 
queen type. Elmire is living proof, 
to paraphrase Shakespeare, that 
which you call a rose by any other 
name would be as beautiful. Beau- 
ty isn't everything, but It's sure 
nice to took at. And, it one can 
overlook her, she's a fine young 
actress too. 

David Thompson once again de- 
livers a super performance. He has 
a monumental stage presence. And 
of course, the key role is Tartuffe, 
played by Larry Life. No ad)ect- 



"Tartuffe" focuses on hypocrisy 



"... He tclt there was so great 
a resemblance between those whom a 
sincere devotion put in the way of 
heaven and those whom j vain osten- 
tation of good works did not prevent 
from achieving bad ones, that in his 
extreme care tor matters pertaining lo 
religion he could not permit this re- 
semblance between vice and virtue, 
which might be mistaken one for the 
other ... he prohiblUd the public 
performance of the play." ~ recorded 
position of King Louis XIV. 
The play by Jean Baptistc 
Poquelin de Moliere is a satirical 
comedy on hypocrisy In general, but 
by portraying Tartuffe as a phoney 
Christian, he drew the Ire of the organ- 
ized church. King Louie sort of liked 
"Tartuffe," but the wrath of the 
church caused him to ban its public 
performance tor a long white. 

The clever satire is a poignant 
attack upon hypocrisy, which Is 
as relevant today as It was In old 
France. But it is not a blast at 
Christianity per se; ratber it is 
directed at hypocrites. 



The King may have been concerned 
about the ability to discern virtue 
from vice. But I tend to agree with 
the famous Samuel Johnson, who when 
told of a gentleman who maintained 
that virtue and vice are indistinguish- 
able, contented himself with observing: 
"Why, sir, when he leaves our house 
let us count our spoons." 

Lines of Cleante, the "intetligent" 
Chiistian, are crystal clear: "(^me, 
just because one rascal made you 
swallow A show of zeal which turned 
out to be hollow. Shall you conclude 
that all men are deceivers, And that, 
today, there are no true believers." 

Tartuffe, the hypocrite, makes a 
mockery of the wishy-washy Qirist- 
ian. He says: "Yet Heaven is not 
averse to compromise; There is a 
science, lately formulated. Whereby 
one's conscience may be liberated. 
And any wrongful act you care to 
mention May be redeemed by purity 
of Intention." 



ives can describe him. To appreci- 
ate his acting, one must view him in 

The pUy rollicks on until Organ 
discovers for himself thai Tartuffe is 
hot on Elmire. Orgon may be dumb, 
but he ain't nat stupid. When he 
sees that a cool rebuff from one such 
as Elmire is not quite enough, his 
righteous indignation reaches a peak. 
Orgon raises a fuss, so Tartuffe 
throws him out of his home (which 
Orgon had given him in one nl his 
more duped moments) through the 
Bsistance of Monsieur Loyal ( Neal 
Bearman). 

But the King, through his emis- 
sary played by Dan Kelly, saves the 
day. He ordered that Tartuffe be 
sent to prison and everything be giv- 
en back lo Orgon, Valere marries 
Marianne and everyone parts merrily. 
Including the audience. 

Moliere's "Tartuffe" is a classic. 
When portrayed by PIT, it's a 
classic "classic." 



The PIT People 



"I don't think I've made over 
$2,000 in one year," explained David 
Thompson, chewing on his unlit 
stogie. "I don't think I'd know what 
to do with it if I did." 

Called "one of the most lovable 
villains we ore ever likely to en- 
counter" J News-Si-nlinel l, for his 
portrayal of Mr. Rich in "Celebration." 
Dave once again is a character 
which the script puts down; yet, 
because it's Dave. Orgon's faults 
tend to be overlooked to a large de- 
gree. ■ 

Dave Thompson Is your basic ham. 
Though he's only been at it for five 
years, he's learning to love it. When 
he's on stage, it takes a monumen- 
tal effort by the other actors (or them 
to be noticed. Dave loves to laugh, 
and make others laugh. You can't 
help but like the guy. 

Which brings us to the mustachoed 
wandering English prof, from Indiana, 
John Brennan. Though somewhat new 
to the PIT scene, he's crazy enough 
to fit in well. Ironically, he plays the 
part of a philosophic Christian. Un- 
fortunately for the clarity of the 
message, it's impossible to take Pro- 
fessor Brennas seriously, 1 can't help 
but smirk just seeing him walking in 
the hall. 

There not being a role tor a 
dance hall stripper, Sharon Gabet 
pbys Orgon's (Thompson's) lovely 



young wife. Sharon is the picture 
of innocence when she invades theatre 
class In her Parkview nursing uniform. 
The image may or may not be Irue, 
but it certainly fits her casting as a 
semi-virtuous woman. As Virgil 
wrote, "Even virtue is more fair when 
It appears in a beautiful person." 

Then there's one of my foremost 
tans, Susan Glazebrook. who plays 
Dorine. Susan is the type of per. 
son who can charm the venom right 
out of a Qiake. Her natural easy- 
going personality and sweet dis- 
position meant that in order to play 
the sarcastic and clever Dorine she 
had to work overtime. 

The major character is larry Life. 
He's also got the lead in 'Tartutte." 
Though in real life he seems semi- 
normal, on stage he's totally trans- 
formed. He's got Ihe fever; acting 
is in his blood. And he's good. 

Larry also enjoys teaching acting. 
Before coming to Indian a- Purdue, he 
taught Frank Sinatra how to act. He, 
Dr. Cashman, and Dr. Kcnworthy 
provide that light-hearted leadership 
and theatrical skill which maintain 
PIT'S status as one of the nation's 
best university theaters. 

All seriousness aside, they've got 
some real One people in PIT. Weird 
maybe, but there are some mighty 
nne PIT people. But I wouldn't 
want my sister to marry one.

SPORTS SCREEN 



by Phil Hart ma tin 

Indiana and Purdue met head-on 
last Saturday at Lafayette with (he 
Boilermakers scoring an upset, 70-69. 

The Boilers were playing without 
the services of their lop scorer and 
rebounder, Willian Franklin, who 
earlier in the week had hired an 
ageit, thus automatically becoming 
ineligible for further college competi- 
tion. This, coupled with the (act 
that Indiana was the hottest team in 
the Midwest, made the Hogsiers 
heavy prc-gamc tavoritcj. 

In (he first half, it appeared as if 
the Hoosicrs would not have much 
trouble living up (o the predictions. 
Steve Downing and Joby Wright 
scored 30 points bctwct^n them to 
give W a lO-point halftime bulge, 
43-33. 

But a sagging second-half zone 
defense by the Boilermakers shut 
off Downing and Wright, and Pur- 
due eckcd out a thrilling one-point 

Bob Ford led the victors with 
24 points, while Wright and Downing 
finished with 23 and 20 tallies re- 
spectively for bidiana. 

Purdue now sUnds at 5-5 in the 
Big Ten, and 11-9 overall. Indiana al- 
so owns a 5-5 mark in league play. 
and is 13-7 overall. 

Last week, the star center of 
Marquette, Jim Chones, signed a $1.5 
million pro contract with New York 
of the ABA. Of course that made him 
ineligible for further college play. With- 
out theit star last Saturday, the un- 
beaten, andrankod Warriors were 
swamped by DeUoit, 70-49. 

Hopefully it won't be long before 
the contract wars between the ABA 
and NBA will come to a long-avi-aited 
end. Nevertheless, the early 1970's 
will still be vividly remembeted as (he 
time when young college stars were 
prEnmurety jerked from college 



to play pro ball for astronomical sums 
of money. It won't be a pleasant 
memory. 

The Port Wayne Komets swept 
two games last weekend and once 
again reached the .500 level. The 
K's log is now 30-30-2 with seven 
games left in the regular season. 

DesMoines, the Komets' rival 
for second place in the South Di- 
vision alt season, has nearly an 
identical record; 30 wins, 30 
lasses, and 3 ties. 

Last Saturday, Fort Wayne jour- 
neyed to Flint and scored a come- 
back 3-1 victory. Then, in a Sunday 
matinee game at the CoMseum with 
Toledo, the locals skated to a 6-2 
verdict. It was an impressive win, 
as the hot Hornets had thrashed 
North Division pacesetter, Muskegon, 
7-5 the night before. 

If the Komets arc healthy when 
the playoffs start, they could fur- 
nish some fine hockey for local 
fans. Injuries and sickness have cut 
the Komet attack considerably in 

Mastodons down 
Indianapolis R.C.

Last Tuesday night the Masto- 
dons downed Indianapolis in the 
State Tournament for Regional 
Campuses, 86-82. Leading 47-40 
at halftime, I-P held on for the 

Four players reached double 
figures for the Mastodons. Mark 
Putt had 19 points, followed by 
Trump with 16 points, Jacquay 15, 
and Powell 10. 

The n 



by Mark Souder 

The once-beaten Dudes handed the 
country boys of the Leo Mafia their 
second consecutive clifl-hanging league 
defeat. But this defeat wasn't as 
stunning as the humiliating scrimmage 
defeat of two days earlier. Three 
Mafia subs, the little Bolller, and 
their friend, Steve Gabet, routed the 
slumping Mafia. 

The lightning speed of a Stan 
Jones (he once ran the 100 in 13 
flat), the deadeye of a Tony ConU- 
delucci, the moral leadership and 
all-round play of a Steve Gabet (he 
doesn't cuss tike his aster), the 
muscle of a Mark Souder, and a Ron 
Bollier proved loo much for the 
pooped out Mafia. As Thomas 
Marshall, former Vice-President of the 
United States, said when asked why 
Indiana produced so many Vice- 
Presidents: "Indiana produces more 
first-rate, second-rate men than any 
other state." 

Cress, Sebert, Perkins, Menshy and 
the elder Bollier slopped in a few 
buckets, but it wasn't like the good 
old days when sparring partners 
knew their place. 

It was a sad day. It's a lot more 
(un to win when you're not coach of 
the team you beat. After the game 
I took off my golf hat, bowed my 
head and had a few moments of 
silence (or the over-the-hill gang. 

But the last two league defeats 
were to tough teams. The Dudes and 
the Barnstormers aren't the glamour 
teams o( the league, and their players 
aren't the superstars. They just win. 
The Barnstormers are undefeated 
and have given the Dudes theu' only 
setback. 

Both the Dudes and the Barn- 
stormers are led by a trio of super- 
shooters. Buichett, Kimes and 
Knetler are the Dudes and Mike 
Teagarden, Beard and Bruns are the 
Barnstormers. The Barnstormers ap- 
pear to be a smoother team, but 
both board like bulls and shoot 

Meg's Men, third in Division II, 
suffered a surprising upset at the 
hands of IVoxel. Undefeated in 



the early going, tbey too have lost 
two straight. The steady IVoiel team 
has consistently scored in the forties 
regardless of whom (bey play. 

Team captain and nnmciake Dave 
Troxel busted the Meg's Men press, 
Phil Gagle rebounded well in 
spite of himself, and Barry McCune 
teamed with Troxel to make Ihe 
big buckeLs, When combined with 
the fact that the Meg's Men pre- 
sent just weren't hitting at all. 
Troxel pulled It out -19-39. 

Hane's Underwear, scrambling 
with the Mafia, House, and Essex 
for a play-off berth, had n merry 
rout over the Barnyard Trotters. 
The hapless Trotters got down 23-2 
and never came back. Though the 
game was shortened considerably, 
the Hane's people piled up a 73-23 
victory, 

Louie Roy, the rnan who's 
hunting for baseball scouts, kept 
his division scoring lead safe with 
24 points. Jeff Hochn overcame 
mediocrity, popping in 23 points. 
Mark Woebnker played his usual 
rugged game, though, because of 
the huge lead and the fact that 
the opposition had only five 
players, he didn't kill anybody. 

The Intramural games have been 
spiced up by the frequent attendance 
o( cool girls, whether they be the 
Mafia wifes or the Circle K and 
lYoxel loyalists. Lovely charmers 
like Brenda Rouse and Sandy Day 
give the crowd some class. 

But the Meg's Men have got the 
thing down. Their cheerblock. with 
pretty Georjean Hazelton leading the 
way, usually is tops. 

But the clever Meg's Men don't 
stop (here. Team leader Steve 
Dttenweller chews some tobacco be- 
fore the game and lets it stick in his 
teeth. Moose L^ughlin blacks out a 
tooth or two. Before the game they 
walk over to their opponents, and 
with a husky chuckle, mutter, "It's 
brave of you's guys to show up." The 
sexy booster club and the mean look 
out-psyche many an opponent. Theyll 
probably make the tourney.
