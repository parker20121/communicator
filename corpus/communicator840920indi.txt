The three major problem areas, 
Ward said, are mistakes made by 
Follett's In lis purchasing orders, the 
publishing companies' errors and 
Instructors who do not submit Ihclr 
requests [or books early enough. 

"A third of the blame can pretty 
much go to each of these factors." 
Word said. 

Instructors can Insure themselves 
and their students a belter chance of 
receiving needed books If they submit 
their request for a particular title very 
early, Ward said. Those teachers who 
have the foresight to order their texts 
as early as the beginning of April for 
the fall semester may see their books 
delivered before most instructors have 
even submitted their requests. 

Also, books which are ordered very 
early may be obtained at a lesser cost

Bus riders' committee advises PTC 



By JENNIFER ACKLEV 
Staff Writer 

Wilh approximately 8,500 riders 
each weekday and 3,000 on Saturdays, 
the Fort Wayne Public Transportation 
Corporation la looking for ways to 
improve service for lis passengers. 

Six months ago, after government 
budgel cuts reduced city bus service. 
PTC formed a Riders' Advisory 
Commit lee. The group is comprised of 
representatives from 21 participating 
businesses and organizations, In- 
cluding IPFW, and offers suggestions 
to PTC on matters such as schedule 
and route changes. 

Operating on 27 different routes 
from S a.m. until 7:30 p.m., the bus 
system offers both express and full 
service lines. Many IPFW students 
end staff members take advantage of 
these services. 

In order lo belter serve IPFW. PTC 
has reserved two seats lor a student 
and staff representative an Its com- 
mittee of 23 members. The student 
seat is currently vacant. Interested 
persons must ride the bus a minimum 
of three times a week and be vocal In 
representing the needs of IPFW. 

Meeting once a month, the com 
mlltee propones improvements in all 
areas of public transportation. The 
suggestions and requests are then 
investigated and acted upon wilh 
regard to extra Incurred costs, driver 
availability, increased mileage, etc. 
The PTC Committee has been helpful 
to IPFW by monitoring bus arrival and 
departure times and adjusting the 
schedules to make them as accurate 
and timely as possible. 

In striving to meet community 
needs, PTC has employed the ex- 
pertise of ATE Management Services, 
Inc., n consulting firm which Is in the 
process of analyzing the bus system. 
By distributing surveys throughout the 
community and receiving feedback 
from bus riders, the firm Is helping 
PTC to achi eve an u pda ted system. 




Questionnaires have been sent to all 
IPFW faculty and staff. Students may 
pick one up In the switchboard area of 
Keltler Hall or in room 118 of Walb 
Memorial Union Questionnaires 
should be completed by all bus riders 
and returned to the student services 
of I Ice, room 11B. Walb, which will 
serve as a channel lo the advisory 
committee. 

The PTC Riders' Advisory Com- 
mittee's last scheduled meeting will be 
held In September, PTC has requested 
that the group continue to meet 
through Ihe end of the year lo advise 



the Corporation I 
service changes 

Several businesses and 

organizations represented by the 
committee, In addition to IPFW, in- 
clude Fort Wayne National Bank, SL 
Joseph's Hospital, the West Central 
Neighborhood Association, Central 
Soya, Murphe/s, South Side High 
School, Magna vox, the Senior Citizens 
Center and several law firms. 

Diana Scott, ihe PTC's Marketing 
Manager, said the advisory board is 
Ihe PTC's arm lo the community, bus 
riders and their fellow employees. 



"By educating the committee and 
giving them a broader understanding 
of how the PTC operates, Ihe PTC can 
educate the community as a whole," 
Scott said. 

IPFW students and faculty are 
urged to respond lo the nuestionna ires. 
In this way, transportation problems 
can be remedied. If not, Scott said the 
rider can write or call the PTC. 

"We're always requesting public 
inpul and although the committee 
meetings are closed to the public, 
public hearings are always held before 
the Implementation of any major 
changes," she said.

Senate's action correct 



Cooler heads prevailed Monday. 

At its firsi meeting, the Fort Wayne 
Faculty Senate considered an amend- 
ment to its bylaws (o allow rPFW inter- 
collegiate athletic teams to participate 
In post season play without the approval 
□f the senate. 

The senate's student affairs com- 
mittee presented the amendment 
Several senate members voiced concern 
over the amendment, fearing athletes 
may be hindered by a conflicting 
schedule. While this [ear is Justified, 
forcing the athletic department to get 
permission from the senate in order to 
accept a post season tournament bid 
would only put the athletes under un- 
necessary duress white waiting for the 



Suppose the women's volleyball team 
gels an invitation to participate in (he 
National Collegiale Athletic Association 
tournament three days before the 
tournament is scheduled to begin. 



Under the old rules, the Student 
Affairs Committee's Subcommittee on 
Athletics would have to approve the 
invitation. The Student Affairs Com- 
mittee would then have to approve the 
invitation, before it is ever brought 
before the senate. The senate, in all 
probability, would have to meet in an 
emergency session in order to allow the 
volleyball team lo participate. 

While the invitation would be 
travelling through all of this 
bureaucratic red tape. Coach Arnle Ball 
would have to keep the player's minds 
away from the distracting question of 
whether or not to participate. Ball would 
have to practice his players as if they 
are going to participate, while knowing 
full well the team may never get a 
chance. 

Fortunately for the athletes, the 
senate allowed the amendment to pass, 
thus giving approval the Subcommittee 
on Athletics to handle such situations 
and thus avoiding miles of red tape.

Representatives from Huntington,

Roush said he was at the precinct 
going over the list of voters lo see who

Roush said there was a babysitter in the 



He then took the couple to the precinct 



to vote. Roush eventually won the 
election by 99 voles, instead of two, but 
he told the story lo prove the point that 
was elected your vote does count. 




Election day is a little over a month 
away. We'll be asked to vote Tor officials 
who will guide the country and the state 
for the next four years. The Com- 
municator encourages all members of 
the community to register and then vote. 

Many of these elected officials will 
make decisions concerning higher 
education and possibly more directly 
concerning IPFW.
