NEWS BRIEFS 

CAMPUS COPS OFFER 
PARKING TIPS 

The IPFW police department wants students lo slop 
trying to park in lot 10. the parking area on the west side 
of Kettler Hall along the St. Joseph River, during busy 
mid-moming hours. 

The police said that students should look elsewhere 
for parking between 9:30 a.m. and II a.m. 

IPFW's Sergeant Lauren Denhartog explained why. 
"Lot 10 is always full at those times. Open parking is 
always available in lots one. two or three; parking near 
the athletic center will actually save time for those who 
park there," he said. 

The campus police also requested students make use 
of the St, Joe Road entrance or, as a second choice, the 
Crescent Avenue entrance, instead of entering campus 
from Coliseum Boulevard, 

"Our main entrance simply cannot handle the amount 
of traffic that the other entrances can handle," Denhartog 
said of the Coliseum entrance, "It is quicker to use the 
alternate entrances, especially when leaving the cam- 
pus," 

Paul Strouts, interim chief of police at IPFW. added 
another parking tip. He reminded students that the C lots 
are available for faculty and students both after 5 p.m. 
but the lots are exclusive to IPFW staff before 5 p,m. 

The C lot areas are located in lot 10. and parking area 
along the river near the Police and Safety building. 

'STOMP' AT IPFW THIS 
WEEKEND 

The IPFW Forensics League will host the "Mastodon 
Stomp" speech tournament this weekend. 

The tournament begins here Friday. 

This year 14 IPFW students will compete. Finalists 
will compete for a chance to be among students from 
240 colleges and universities expected to participate in 
the national tournament sponsored by the National 
Forensics League. 

The team's coaches, B. Keith Murphy, assistant profes- 
sor of communication, and Regina Kostoff, associate 
faculty in communication hope to better last year's 17th 
national placement and bring IPFW into the top ten. 

"We've got the talent and the students." Murphy said. 
"It's just a matter of them doing the work to get quali- 
fied and to be strong enough for national competition." 

Will they make it? "It's hard to make predictions this 
early, we'll see," Murphy said, 

HOMELESSNESS ISSUE 
TO BE ADDRESSED HERE 

The Student Action Project of IPFW will sponsor a lec- 
ture and workshop by Steve Haddod, regional director 
of the National Student Campaign against Hunger and 
Homelessness- 

The lecture will deal primarily with the problems of 
hunger and homelessness. The workshop will outline the 
purpose and tactics of the National Hunger Cleanup, 
according to Amanda Goodman, committee coordinator 
of SAR 

"We wish to inform people that a national hunger crisis 
exists and that it is each person's responsibility to get 
involved," Goodman said. 

The presentation, which will be held Feb. 10 at noon in 
Walb memorial Union. Room 222, is free to the public. 

LECTURE LOOKS INTO 
'CLIMATE' FOR WOMEN 

A lecture entitled "Chilly Climate for Women Faculty" 
will be taking place on campus Tuesday. 

The lecture will be given on Tuesday, Feb, 4. at 1:30 
p.m. in Walb Memorial Union. Room 224, The talk will 
be led by Deborah Belogh, Ph. D. and Mary Kite, Ph. 
D. of Ball State University. 

Elaine Blakemore. a professor in the IPFW psycholo- 
gy department, stated, "The specific goal is primarily 
informational, to make people aware that the experi- 
ences of female faculty members are different from the 
experiences of male faculty members." 

The Affirmative Action Challenge Grant, a program 
intended to provide information about the experiences of 
women and minorities on campuses, will be co-sponsor- 
ing the event. 

Other sponsors of the lecture are the School of Arts and 
Sciences, and the departments of philosophy and psy- 
chology. The event open to the public at no charge. 



Charges dismissed, Barger awaits decision 



By Jim Walker 
Editor in Chief 

Last Sunday night, Ibt IPSGA 
judicial court njled [hat the inter- 
nal affairs investigation of Nan- 
cy Barger's misconduct charges 
was flawed, and dismissed the 
case. 

However, a stay was granted, 
prohibiting Barger from rejoin- 
ing the senate as an active mem- 
ber until an appeal can be heard 



by the Campus Appeils Board. 

The IPSGA judicial court 
decided lo dismiss the charges 
because of several errors in the 
procedures taken by internal 
affairs. According to a judicial 
court report, the internal affairs 
committee erred by sending 
Barger's notification of 
impcaclimeni by certified mail 
instead of registered mail as 
specified by Robert's Rules of 
Order.

Police officials 
address student 
quesitons, concerns 



By Mike Wade 
News Editor 

IPFW students have questioned 
the quality of protection offered 
by the campus police. 

Brandy Fiedler, a theater 
major, said, "During the day I 
feci safe, but I'm afraid lo walk 
around campus at night 

"I don't sec the police around 
campus much," Fiedler contin- 
ued, "All they do is drink coffee 
in the cafeteria." 

Larry Jenks, campus police 
ofHcer, said that if the students 
were to follow Sergeant Lauren 
Dentianog around for a day stu- 
dents wouldn't think that's all 
the police do. 

Fred Douse, a secondary edu- 
cation major, said that patrols 
in the parking garage needed to 
be improved He also thought 
that the campus was poorly lit 
at night. 

Both Douse and Friedler said 
that they were unaware that the 
campus police offer an escort 
service for people who are afraid 
to walk across campus at night. 

Paul Snouts, interim chief of 
police and director of safety. 
said that within the next two 
weeks the department would 
begin dispensing whistles 
through the Center for Women 
and Returning Adults. 

The phone number of police 
and safely will appear on one 
side of the whistle, and the num- 
ber for the escort service will 
appear on the oiher. 

Strouts said that in addition to 
providing a sense of confidence, 
he hoped the whistles would also 
inaease awareness of the escort 
service, so that more people 
would use iL 

Students also complain atwui 



ticketing. Douse said, "Anoth- 
er thing that really makes me 
mad is all the tickets they pass 
out. They should have other 
things to do." 

In response to Douse's com- 
plaint, police officer Ronald 
Motz said, "As long as you have 
parking enforcement, people are 
going to get dckets." 

Motz is not bothered by the 
amount of student complaints. 
"If I had wanted to be loved by 
everyone. I would have been a 
fireman," be said. 

IPFW student Mark Snydei. in 
a letter to the editor which 
appeared in The Communicator 
last week, said that the police 
department was demoralized. 

Police officer Laiiy Jenks dis- 
agreed with Snyder's comment. 
"I've been very happy here. If I 
hadn't been happy, I would have 
left. 1 enjoy the college atmo- 
sphere. I enjoy the students." 

Open positions 
to be filled 

By Mike Wode 

News Editor 

Amidst student allegations of 

police misconduct and poor 

management, the Depanmeni of 
Police and Safely is conducting 
a self-siudy intended to help tar- 
get problems and improve ser- 
vices, 

In 3 letter lo the editor, which 
appeared in The Communicator 
last week, student Mark Snyder 
claimed, "This university has 
allowed the Department of 
Police and Safely to dcieriorale 
10 a level of staffing which is 
criminally negligent." 

See Police page 3 



Some of the other mistakes 
noted by judicial court included 
"questionable tactics" specifying 
that "no attempt to contact the 
accused was made by the inves- 
tigating cotimiince prior to noti- 
fication of impeachment," 

Judicial court concluded in the 
report that the invesiigation of 
Barger was unfairly processed, 
"In the opinion of the Judicial 
court, the cumulative effect of 
these discrepancies results in an 



abuse of the fair impeachment 
process ..." 

Mike Will, senator, was in 
charge of the internal affairs 
investigation. He said that inter- 
nal affairs has submitted an 
appeal lo the Campus Appeals 
Board. 

The board will review the 

appeal and decide whether the 
judicial court was correct in its 
ruling. If ihe board overrules the 



judicial court, impeachment pro- 
ceedings will start again. Will 

said. 

"I'd rather justice be done than 
10 have it put off like this." noted 
WUI. 

Barger said she just wanted a 
fair trial, "I wanted to know 

what they arc saying about me." 
she said. "From what I've heard 
we arc in different ball parks 
here." 



IPFW's student athletes prove 
they are more than just jocks 



By Jim Walker 
Editor in Chief 

At IPFW. student athletes arc 
working hard lo be winners on 
and off the court 

According lo David Fairchild, 
IPFWs NCAA compliance 
coordinator, adiletes here excel 
at both levels. "Our teams are 
good enough to beat anybody 
who comes in here. Our young 
people can play with anybody 
they choose lo play," Fairchild 
said, "And we've done that with 
some degree of academic suc- 
cess." 

Fairchild noted that one third 
of IPFW's athleies are on the 
academic distinction list. The 
athlete's average GPA for the 
1991 fall semester was 2.5 on 
the 4,0 point scale. This numtjer 
is slightly above the average for 
IPFW students in general, 
according to university statistics. 

Some IPFW teams carried high 
collective GPAs this fall. The 
women's basketball team bad a 
3.06 collective GPA, Women's 
cross country, women's volley- 
ball and Softball were both very 



close to the 3.0 GPA mark. 
Men's basketball and volleyball 
both finished the fall semester 
with 2.7 GPAs. 

"You've got to give the kids a 
lot of credit," men's baskclball 
coach Andy Piazza said, "We 
had six players on our team with 
a 3.0 or higher last semester. It 

"If you don't take school 
seriously, you will have a 
lot of trouble as a student 
atfilete. " 

-Lisa Miller 

takes a lot of effort by everyone 
involved, especially the kids, lo 
succeed academically like we do 
here." 

According to a report provided 
by Fairchild, only four of our 
172 student athletes were deter- 
mined academically ineligible 
for spring competition. The 
report noted that every basket- 
ball and volleyball player was 
eligible to play this spring. The 
report added that 56 aibletes 
earned academic distinction, 30 
had GPAs between 3.0 and 3,5, 
26 atbletcs had GPAs higher 



ihan 3.5 and direc had GPAs of 
4,0. 

The report also stated that 
every team had al least two stu- 
dents who achieved academic 
distinction. 

"What we are quite pleased 
with is ttiat our athletes have, in 
fact, done very well academical- 
ly. Some athletes have done 
extraordinarily well. We have 
some athleies taking 15 or 17 
credit hours and still achieving 
high GPAs. 1 think that's prelly 
impressive," Fairchild said. 

Some of IPFW's best students 
can be found on the women's 
basketball team. Senior Lisa 
Miller has set several school 
records including becoming the 
38th NCAA Division II player to 
pass the 2.000 point scoring 
mark, and all the while Miller 
has mainlained a cumulative 
GPA of 3.76. 

Miller says school work comes 
first. "If you don't take school 
seriously you'll have a lot of 
trouble as a student athlete. You 
Jusl have to take the time and

School arts future at stake 



By Chad Besting 
Managing Editor 

Local arts educators are lobby- 
ing against a proposed change in 
the curriculum time require- 
ments, known as Title 511. now 
in force in Indiana schools. 

Title 511 sets minimum time 
requirements for school subjects, 
which children in grades K-8 
must satisfy. Subjects included 
in Title 511 are mathematics, 
grammar, science, music, and 
physical education. Under the 
new proposals, the K-8 require- 
ments would be eliminated 
entirely. 

Removing the requirements 
could mean diminishing the 
standing of fme arts in Indiana 
schools, according to those lot&gt;- 
bying for the proposals' rejec- 
tion. 

IPFW music professor Joyanoe 
OuUand feels thai "lifting these 
time requirements will tempt 
school boards and principals to 
allot time and resources primari- 
ly for courses which are neces- 
sary either for ISTEP or as back- 
ground for required courses in 
high school. 

"The danger is that this will be 
done lo the unnecessary exclu- 
sion of other important areas of a 
child's education. Nodiing in the 
current assessment procedure for 
the schools would prevent this," 



she said. 

Joseph Scagnoli, president of 

the Indiana Music Education 

Association concurred. "As the 

proposed rule changes stand, 
there is no assurance that schools 
will tie held accountable for pro- 
viding programs that include 
these areas" such as the arts and 
physical education. 

Lobbyists believe that, along 
with fine arts, pracucal aru and 
physical education programs wUI 
also be diminished. 

The proposal has its genesis in 
the National Education Goals set 
forth last year by President Bush 
in tiis "America 2000" program. 
according to Outland. 

The National Education Goals 
call for new achievement stan- 
dards in the subjects of mathe- 
matics, grammar, history, sci- 
ence, and geography. Recom- 
mendations for fine arts, physi- 
cal education, practical arts, eco- 
nomics, and civics programs arc 
absent from ihe goals, 

Outland said Indiana educa- 
tors' indignation over the federal 
government's neglect of fine arts 
education was further fueled by 
a widely circulated letter written 
by Secretary of Education Lamar 
Alexander. 

In dial leiicr, Alexander sug- 
gests that "extracurricular arts 
programs" become a pan of fme 



arts education in lieu of time in 
the classroom. 

According to Scagnoli, state 
school superinienden, H. Dean 
Evans authored Ihe Indiana time 
eliminations. Scagnoli believes 
that proponents of the time 
requirement eliminations 
"intended to let school boards 
adjust children's educations to 
local needs," 

Nonetheless, he said, "It's 
unfair to let fine arts programs 
across the state be held hostage 
for an untested proposal." 

Hard financial limes may lend 
momentum to the proposals' 
success in front of the Board of 
Education. A pattern of arts 
education cuts runs in cycles 
with die economy, according to 
IPFW music professor Rosalie 
Haritun. 

"Ii happens every lime," she 
said. "When money gets low. Ihe 
arls are the place ihey want to 
cut first." 

Haritun went on lo say, "The 
development of the aesthetic 
nature can only be done in for- 
mal training, Man can live his 
life without it (the aesthetic 
experience), but it won't be a 
rich existence," 

The proposals will be debated 
before the Board of Education in 
March. 



New senators take spots in IPSGA

Two new senators joined the 
IPSGA student senate on Sun- 
day. Jan. 19., Tad Atkinson, a 
graduate student pursuing a 
master's degree in English liter- 
ature: and Elbert Webster, a 
freshman majoring in electrical 
engineering. 

Atkinson said be joined sen-

do so by siudenis inside and 
outside of student government. 
"With my uaining in analysis

Atkinson has no specific 
agenda except to do what he 
feels is right for the student 
body, "I won't vote for 
frivolous legislation that has 
not been thought through. Thai 
kind of thinking is a waste of 
money."

School arts programs 
need protection 



Local arts educators are to be com- 
mended for their swift action in the face 
of the proposed elimination of subject 
time requirements in Indiana schools. 

Little time was lost in assembling a 
coalition of college professors, high 
school teachers, elementary school 
teachers, parents, and other concerned 
individuals- Reportedly band members 
and parent-teacher groups have also been 
stuffing envelopes in order to convince 
Siaie Board of Education members to 
keep the current time requirements in 
place. 

Unfortunately, persons interested in the 
arts in this slate have good reasons to be 
nervous about the proposals. 

For upwards of 10 years Americans 
have been plagued with stories of Amer- 
ica's failing education system. Nation- 
wide SAT averages drop slowly, year 
after year. American math aptitude 
ranks among the lowest in the world. 



compared with Western European 
nations and Japan. 

A Lincoln Life CEO, Ian Rolland, 
showed Fort Wayne his dissatisfaction 
with the quality of the education Lincoln 
employees had received. 

With bad news like that, it's a tempta- 
tion for state education officials to 
"emphasize" traditional core subjects 
like math, science, and grammar. It's a 
good bet that arts programs will be the 
first to be pushed aside for expanded tra- 
ditional core curriculum- 
Imagine that such a plan were wildly 
successful. We would be willfully rob- 
bing our arts culture to pay for a nation 
of accountants and retail managers. 
Those lobbying the state government 
know this, and are working now to cre- 
ate a beautiful day for their children. 
Let us hope the stale Board of Educa- 
tion has the foresight to do the same. 



Pro-lifers guilty of 
creating chaos 



By Chad Hesting 
Managing Editor 

Last Sunday they marched again. 5000 
anti-abortion activists, stopping traffic to 
say to all watching, "life begins at day 
one after conception, and that stopping 
the embryo's progress at any point after 
that is murder." 

At one of the intersections I stopped to 
see them walk by. The organizers' con- 
tention that the March on Life parade 
was a separate entity from the Northeast 
Indiana Rescue organization was laugh- 
able. About one in every 10 persons I 



COMMENTARY 



saw walking had been picketers of the 
Women's Health Organization Clinic. 

These were the same ones crawling by 
the hundreds, blocking up Webster Street 
to close down the clinic. The same ones 
that nearly pushed over City Council 
repnisentalive Janet Bradbury when she 
tried to wade through the seated bodies 
at the clinic's door. The same ones who 
prayed for the Rev. Wendell Brane after 
he punched a female escort in front of 
the clinic. 

The same ones I heard offer up these 
names for the women and men entering 
the clinic: "fool," "slut," "son of a 
bitch," "murderer." 

Murderer, There's so much inhumanity 
in the world, but the Roman Catholic 
Church and the Protestant right wing 
chooses abortion rights as their forum to 
do "good." 

Homclessness. child abuse, and AIDS 
all go by the wayside while pro-lifers 
pursue their tenuous, divisive debate. 
Why? 

The Christian church in the United 
Slates lost moral foreground during the 



1960s and 70s, Church attendance 
declined while young America pushed 
against Christian strictures. 

Nowhere was the result more apparent 
than in the change in sexual attitudes. 
The pill, co-habitalion, and increasing 
acceptance of homosexuality struck at 
the basic tenants of Christian sexuality. 
For some fifteen years the right wing 
saw their beliefs flouted, but could not 
do much about it 

Abortion became their place to retrench 
in the early 80s. Catholics had been 
vocal in their opposition since abortion's 
legalization, but the Protestant right 
wing didn't join in until the lale 70s. 

Reversing the sexual revolution was the 
anti-abortion movement's intent. By 
declaring that conception is the begin- 
ning of life, no margin of error is left for 
the sex partners. Either responsibility is 
assumed or a sin is committed. 

At the same time pro-lifers make con- 
ception inevitable by opposing birth con- 
trol and sex education. The stain of sin 
and an unwanted baby become the forni- 
cators' birthright. Those entering an 
abortion clinic are the ones unwilling lo 
accept that birthright. They are subject- 
ed to "loving" abuse from the picketers. 

By wasting energy on the abortion 
question. Catholics and the Protestant 
right wing are forgetting their brothers 
and sisters, so much money, given freely 
to the churches every week, is there to be 
used. Those funds should be aimed at 
poverty relief programs, real catalysis 
for a caring society, and not glass palaces 
like the Calvary Temple. 

Far belter monuments could be built to 
help the homeless men that stay in the 
park beside the clinic. The marchers 
walked right past them Sunday, like 
every other day they've been then;. 




Defending campus police protection efforts | 



To the Editor: 

! wisti (0 take issue with Mark 
Snyder's Jan. 23 letter to the edi- 
tor in The Commt]nicaior. This 
particular letter found fault with 
the current administration, as 
well as the faculty, staffi and stu- 
dent community in addressing 
issues of campus safely. 

While Mr. Snyder challenges 
us to not dismiss his letter as yet 
another ".,, of Snyder's ravings," 
he still demonsiraies the contin- 
ued use of mouth and pen with- 
out benefil of brain power. 

His puerile aliempis at sensa- 
tionalism, "demanding" the 
response of an apathetic campus 
commimily in the face of "outra- 
geous" university negligence 
only stir up mild amusement and 
some disappointment that he and 
perhaps tliose who believe bis 
rhetoric are actually that misin- 
formed. 

J, would suggest that Mr. Sny- 
der take his own advice and 
"check tliese facts for yourself. 

Despite accusations that Mr, 
Snyder has often "made life dif- 
ficult by creating issues out of 
trivial things," his latest tirade 
has not brought a "trivial" matter 
into Ihe limelight. Personal safe- 
ty is an issue regardless of loca- 
lion-in trie city, in your home, 
or on a college campus. What 
Mr. Snyder is not aware of. how- 
ever, is that there arc individuals 
on campus who are devoting 
themselves to making everyone's 
campus experience not only edu- 
cational but pleasant and safe as 
well. 

Paul Sirauts has been appoint- 
ed interim chief of the IPFW 
department of public safely. 
Despite his lack of policing 
background, he has prevailed 
over any criticisms which might 
be aimed at him. He has demon- 
strated that listening to both your 



clienlele and your employees 
and then acting on dieir sugges- 
tions can result in positive 
changes in the administration of 
a department. 

He has had ongoing contact 
with law enforcement officials in 
both Fort Wayne and New 
Haven, has reviewed Ihe prac- 
tices of the public safety depart- 
ments of Indiana University, 
Purdue University, Ball Slate 
University, and Michigan Slate 
University; and has consulted 
with numerous other law 
enforcement organizations. 

He has also consulted individu- 
als on campus concerning Uieir 
perception of the needs of the 
academic community. 

Being an instructor of criminal 
justice counes and a specialist in 
law enforcement issues. I have 
continually served as a sounding 
board for the ongoing efforts lo 
improve our public safety 
departmenl. I can attest to both 
the genuine interest in campus 
safely thai our interim chief 
demonstrales, and to his continu- 
ing efforts to integrate innova- 
tive approaches into regular 
police practice. 

He has conducted an in-house 
evaluation of police services, has 
formed a board of representa- 
tives from within die department 
to address the issues raised by 
this evaluation, and has made 
every effort to dovciail the con- 
cerns of department employees, 
the administration, and ihe gen- 
eral campus community. 

The administration has been 
very supportive of his efforts 
and, as a result, emergency 
phones are being installed acioss 
the campus, whistles are being 
made available lo students at the 
Center for Women and Relum- 
ing Adults, and officers are 



spending more time patrolling 
die buildings and talking to stu- 
dents about their concerns. 

There are also plans to hold 
ongoing educational programs 
with faculiy, staff, and students, 
10 address safely issues, and to 
involve officers in special train- 
ing seminars so ihal they may 
bedcr serve their constituency. 

While ihcse plans arc still in 
the development stage, they are 
a far cry from die complete dere- 
liction of duty implied by Mr. 
Snyder's comments. 

As 10 the vacancy in the chiefs 
position, it will be posted within 
the next two weeks. It was felt 
that current in-bouse require- 
menls and practices needed to be 
evaluated before a new individu- 
al was hired. 

Unlike Mr. Snyder, die admin- 
istration sought out valid infor- 
mation before it took any action. 

The posUng will thus reflect 
the needs of our campus commu- 
nity, and will, in turn, mandate 
dial the individual selected will 
best fit our projected goals. 
Without the evaluations and 
improvements of these past three 
months, we could not lake this 
educated approach. 

As to the budget concerns and 
the deployment of current offi- 
cers, efforts are being made lo 
recruit appropriate employees 
and make tbc best use of the 
ones we tiavc. 

Mr. Snyder fails to recognize 
the necessity for personnel allo- 
cation appropriate to calls for 
assistance, supervisory require- 
menls for each shift, and Ihe 
myriad of other "minor details" 
which accompany effective man- 
agement of this kind of depart- 
ment. 

Mr, Snyder speaks of the 
"demoralized" officers on the 



depariment. Who creates afi 
atmosphere conducive to ihi^ 
demoralization? Not just lh|: 
administrators of the department 
but the campus community 
itself. I 

Officers are not working herl: 
so diey can have the opportunity 
to harass you, they are here to 
serve you and look out for your 
needs. Many of Ihem are on the 
department because they want t() 
help people, it's more than just ^ 
paycheck. j 

Bear that in mind next lime 
you see them on campus; take 
time 10 smile and talk to ihen{. 
They have names and personali- 
ties, not jusi badges and un^ 
forms. I 

It for no other reason Uian past 
history, there are going to b^ 
rough spots that we must worjc 
Ujrough. This newest realloca- 
tion of resources will be no dif- 
ferent. ! 

Although Mr. Snyder mincfi 
his valid plea lo work "logedi^ 
peaceably," he is correct in caH- 
ing for us lo be active in thp 
development of our campus 
community. While die poliiical 
and legal ramifications ojf 
neglect are always a possible 
source of retribution, the morf 
informed, active and persistent 
response will almost invariabW 
be the best approach. : 

I encourage the readers of thjs 
paper lo gel involved in campus 
safety by talking to officer^, 
security guards, and others 
involved in the public safei^ 
department. Constructive criti- 
cism and an open mind ,is 
opposed to condemnation aird 
ignorance will result in a more 
progressive and secure academic 
environmenl for all of us. i

Graham attacks Frazier-Henry's actions 



To the Editor: 

How do you respond to some- 
one whose strongest defense is 
to discredit your signature 
instead of your letter? Yes, 
Krislina, diere is a Derek Gra- 
ham and he's pissed. 

Where do you gel off discredit- 
ing me witliout even Hying to 
contaci me? Where did you gel 
your information? From Internal 
Affairs or did you pull it out of 
your own hai? No one, and I 
repeat no one, ever questioned 
me in regard lo my letter. 

I suggest diat, as student body 
presideni, you be more careful 
before you credit or discredit any 
letters, ."lomeone of your posi- 
tion should be intelligent and 
responsible enough to contact 
the writer before making such 
accusations. Do you realize that 
by the precedent you are now 
setting I can demand you be 
brought up on impeachment 
charges for fatse statements? 

Since you are so quick to 
defend yourself and other IPS- 
GA members I hope you will 
clarify some questions slill lefi 
open. I wilt have graduated 
when this is published, so please 
reply, if noi in defense then in 
consideration of the student 
Ixidy. 

You stated tliat Internal Affairs 
has "followed the rules." If so, 
where was ihc "conference wilh 



the accused" to assure a fair and 
just process as described in 
Robert's Rules if order? 

I qucsiion any group who takes 
it upon itself to investigate 
someone, keep the matter a 
secret from other officials, 
attempt lo push it quickly 
through before any objections 
could arise, and refuse to answer 
questions. I quesiion bolh the 
groups sincerity and its profes- 
sionalism. 

Under whose authority did they 
revoke the scnalors' rights before 
the maticr was brought before 
the IPSGA? What about your 
similar request? Has anyone in 
students' government heard of 
due process? Do you really care 
to see a fair outcome or is 
revenge your greatest motive? 

My point is that in all fairness, 
especially when verbal state- 
ments arc involved, ask both the 
accusers and the accused what 
happened. 

You proceed to take the 
defense of your six hour notice 
emergency meeting. I ask you 
this: Why was this such an 
emergency? What reasons do 
you have for not making sure 
that all IPSGA officials have 
been given sufficient notice? 
Were the offenses of dire emer- 
gency such as u-eason or mur- 
der? 



Impeachment is a serious and 
delicate process that should be 
handled better. 

As far as 'Tacts" go, the point 1 
made was that all three of the 
accused stated they could not 
mcel on Monday. Yet after 
spcclTically stating diis you held 
the meeting on Monday. Your 
lack of f^mess astounds me. 

In your defense I will concede 
that you gave your short notice, 
"emergency" meeting 22 min- 
utes instead of the 15 you first 
allotted. Your kindness has not 
gone unnoticed. 

About your comment claiming 
thai 1 wanted people to think die 
"government is solely run by 
three individuals".. .never did 1 
claim thai the IPFW student gov- 
ernment was run by certain indi- 
viduals. Where ditl you come up 
with this? If you notice I used 
the words "et al" which means 
"and others," so I would not for- 
get anyone. Look it up. 

And what is the point of asking 
senators how they voted last 
suirmier? The names you men- 
tioned did not appear as the 
authors of the senate standing 
rules, as yours does. It is irrele- 
vant to ask anyone other than die 
authors of the bill what was 
meant or said. Please, do not 
"pass die buck." 

Feel free to defend accusations 
1 have not made, but do not put 



words in my mouth. And thank 
you for pointing out that of the 
other four authors, three bav^ 
served as internal affairs chairs. ■ 

Disregarding the fact that np 
one aitemplcd to resolve this 
matter without a full trial, why, 
did internal affairs walk out of ai 
senate meeting, refusing lo. 
answer queslions? i 

If they are acting within their) 
powers and in a fair manner thenj 
why do they hide from ques-i 
tions? Do they also believe thisi 
is a ridiculous game that must be&gt;i 
pushed quickly through before! 
people catch on? Belween inier-j 
nal affairs actions and your own,', 
this seems ridiculously apparent, ^j 

Now diat 1 have read the prcsi-;i 
dent of the student body's letter l| 
understand how IPFw student'} 
government probably works. It] 
would be very sad if her leiier] 
represents the entire IPSGA." 
They should be reminded thaii 
their decisions and policies,! 
whether productive or just a per- 1 
sonal vendetta, affect more than) 
diis year's student body, ; 

My point, Kristina Frazier-j 
Henry, is Ihat your silly games- 
today will affect future IPFW I 
students who will not even know ', 
your name. Think of your fel-J 
low students first, please. I

Foundation funds help 
students Hnish school 



By Mike Wade 
News Editor 

The Withers Scholars Founda- 
lion is attempting to help 
IPFW's academically elite cope 
with the rising costs of a college 
education. 

The foundation awarded full 
tuiUon scholarships to 11 IPFW 
students for the 199I-I992 school 
year and is currently accepting 
applications for next year. 

Only IPFW students are eligible 
for the scholarships, so the 
chances of receiving the award 
are better than with some national 
foundations, according to Clif- 
ford Scott, Withers trustee. 

Last year approximately 20 peo- 
ple applied for the scholarships. 
and eleven were granted the 
awards, said Scott 

The foundation has been award- 
ing scholarships to IPFW stu- 
dents since 1983. The late Freda 
Withers, a former Fort Wayne 
school teacher, willed her estate. 
and the income from ihe estate, to 
provide scholarships for students 
in the academic areas where she 
or her sister had worked. 

For the 1991-1992 school 
year, the awards were received 
by Karen Charters, Gene Conn, 
Denise Cross, Marjorie Goy- 
Ings, Sharon Huls. Shannon 
Kruse. Barbara McDaniel. Lisa 
Miller. Katheryn Neukam, 
Nicole Ramirez, and Kimberly 
Somjarlee. 

"It was definitely the most 
exciting thing that happened at 
our house last year." said Huls, 
an elementary education major. 
"Just knowing that' ray hafd 
work had finally paid off was 
very encouraging to me," she 
continued. 

The scholarships are based pri- 
marily on GPA, with a trunimum 
OPA of 3.00 on a 4.00 scale 



Need is not a factor in determin- 
ing who will receive the awards. 

According to Scott, "The 
scholarships arc not awarded on 
the basis of need. We have 
come to realize that everyone 
needs money," 

Scott expects that the number of 
awards given next year will be 
fewer since the economy is in a 
lull. Heexplained that the money 
the foundation uses to pay for the 
scholarships is the interest earned 
from Withers estate, so when 
interest rales decline, the number 
of awards available also declines. 

When asked about the require- 
ments, Scott emphasized that 
GPA was the number one 
requirement saying, "She 
(Withers) wanted to help stu- 
dents who had already proven 
that they were good students, 
and reward them by making it 
easier to get through school." 

The applicants should be 
juniors or seniors in the year the 
award is to be received, but 
need not be juniors or seniors at 
the time of application. 

Also, it is reqtured that the ShJ- 
dents be majoring in elementary 
education, history, political sci- 
ence. English, communication, 
theater, or library sciences; and 
must be full-time students each 
semester of the academic year. 

Speaking about the applica- 
tion. Huls commented. "It was 
an easy form to fill out com- 
pared to some of the others, and 
it was based on merit." 

Applications can be picked up 
at the Office of Financial Aid in 
Kettler Hall. For consideration, 
all application materials, includ- 
ing three letters of recommenda- 
tion must be received by the 
IPFW Office of Financial Aid by 
Mar. 20, 1992.

siudy instead of spending all of your 
lime on spons and social things. The 
studies have to come first." 

Fairchild agreed with Miller's asser- 
tion thai student aihlctcs have to make 
Ihe grades for themselves. But he added 
ihai the athletic depanmeni can help. 

"We try to stress an individual's per- 
sonal responsibility for iheir academic 
success," he said. "Athletes are very 
disciplined, very motivated people. 
They arc quite used to performing even 
al some levels of sacrifice, on the court. 
And we try to stress to them that they 
are in control of their own destiny. 

We lelj ihcm thai they can achieve ai 
ihc same level in Ihe classroom that 
ihey achieve on Ihe court. And have ihe 
same desire and sett discipline in class 
that they have in their sports." Fairchild 
said. 

Along with a student athlcle's own 
deienninalion, IPFW hopes to use aca- 
demic guidelines to keep athlete's

deni body president.) 1 asked her about 
joining." 

Webster would like to see senate 
become more of a functional organiza- 
tion for the student body. "I'd Lke to 
see us get more minority cnrollmenl," 
he said. 

Webster, who is a member of scnaic's 
student affairs committee, said he 
would like to see minority studenis 
enjoy IPFW campus by parlicipaling 
more, not only in student government 
but another organizations as well. 

John Weisenburger. vice president of 



demic guidelines to keep athlete's 
grades up. said Fairctiild. Student ath- 
letes have Iheir grades checked three 
times per semester and have their eligi- 
bihly reviewed three limes per year. 
These are rules established by IPFW, 
according to Fairchild. 

"The NCAA has absolutely minimal 
requirements," Fairchild said. "We 
have regulations far more rigorous than 
the NCAA and even more rigorous than 
the GLVC." 

Student athletes here arc also required 
to be in legitimate degree programs, 
according to Fairchild. There are no 
easy "hidden degree programs" at 
IPFW. he said- 

Basically, IPFW is no UNLV. "We 
are making significani efforts to inte- 
grate Ihe athletic population into the 
student population at large iq ways 
which we believe are more than super- 
ficial and really do make a difference," 
Fairchild said. "We think our efforts 
arc paying off." 



Police 



continued from page 1 

The department is budgeted for 
eight police officers, one chief of 
police, and four security guards, 
according to Paul Sirouts, interim 
chief of police and director of safe- 
ty. 

"The department currently has sev- 
en police officers and three security 
officers. A search is currently 
underway to fill the vacant officer 
positions," said Slrouls. "Addilion- 
ally, the department has recently 
hired another clerk to enable police 
and security lo focus on pairols, 
ralhcr than paperwork," he said. 

Stouts admitted that two of the 
officers are sergeants responsible 
primarily for administrative duties, 
and one of the officers is currently 
in training at the law enforcement 
academy. 

Police calls arc a top priority and 
the sergeants put aside adminisua- 



tivc duties when circumslances war- 
rant, added Su^uls. 

Strouts said Ihe department is con- 
tinuing to look at the current cover- 
age, with respect to the number of 
students. In doing so the department 
will attempt to determine whether or 
not the budgeted number of police 
and security guards would provide 
adequate protection for the campus. 

The department is also undergoing 
a self-study which will outline the 
dcpartmeni's strengths and weak- 
nesses. The points which need lo be 
worked on will then be prioritized 
and handled, according lo Slrouls, 

Strouts said ihai the search for a 
new chief will begin when the self- 
siudy. concludes in early February. 
in order lo give the new chief a sta- 
ble starting point. Strouls said he 
would not become the permanent 
chief 



legislation, described the studenis who 
have joined Senate in the last several 
weeks as "good workers and responsi- 
ble people." Weisenburger feels that 
the recent lumover in senate has hurt 
morale rather than senate's actual func- 
tioning. He said he is pleased to see 
that senators are becoming involved 
with their committees and projects. 
"Apathy causes a lot of the turnover. 1 
don't want to see anyone come in, 
throw it on their resume, and leave," 
he said. 

"Some people don't get involved 
form the beginning, and those arc the 
ones who leave. When you get 



involved, you care about the people 
you talk to, and you don'l just walk 
away. The turnover is from those who 
don't get involved form Ihe start," said 
Weisenburger. 

Weisenburger added that studenis 
interested in joining Senate may pick 
up a petition sat the student govern- 



ment office in Walb Memorial Union 
225. After filling out the peliiion and 
obtaining SO student signatures, the 
petition should be rcmmed to ihe stu- 
dent government secretary, who will 
then forward the pcdlion to ihe appro- 
priate individuals. Senate currently 
has three open seals.

PIT play opens 

'Voice of Prairie' offers variety, 
director expects strong opening 



By Sarah Jakacky 
Features Editor 

"Voice of Ihe Prairie" debutes 
lomorrow ai the PIT Iheaicr and 
director Lorraine Sauicr anlicipaies a 
very strong opening. 

According lo Sauier. a visiting assis- 
tant theater professor from Chicago, 
the play is multi-faccicd. "I enjoy 
stoiy-lclling very much because it is a 
challenge for the actors and the audi- 
ence. This play is touching, funny, 
ard enjoyable. It won't let the audi- 
ence just sit back and relax. They 
have to participate," she says. 

The play is also a challenge for the 
actors because everyone plays multi- 
ple roles. "Voice of the Prairie," 
which was written by John Olive in 



1985, has three actors who play a 
total of twelve roles. The actors are 
Nathan Stuery, a theater major, Chris- 
tine Briehnaier, a theater major, and 
Jeffrey Moore, community member. 

Sauter says that it is often necessary 
to have open casting because "there 
simply arc not enough for ibc few 
pans in this play." However, she says 
that there was a lot of competition at 
the auditions. 

"I didn't mind because it just means 
you have more people to choose from. 
The people I did choose were the best 
people for the parts," says Sauter. 

"Voice of the Prairie" is set in 1895 
and 1923, It is about the beginnings 
of radio in America, growing up. and 



slory-ielling. According to Sauter. 
the main character David Quinn. 
begins by telling a story about how he 
ran away as a child and met a blind 
girl named Frankie. Then, 25 years 
later the two are reunited. 

"This play offers a lot of variety 
because of the multiple roles," says 
Sauter. Although she thinks that she 
does not have a good deal for the box 
office. Sauter anticipates a very 
strong opening. 

"The actors are in great shape and 
are very ready for opening night." 
adds Sauier. 

"Voice of the Prairie" will run Jan. 
31, Feb. 1. 6, 7. and 8, and 13, 14. and 
15. 



'JFK' is a blend of fact, fiction 



Mid EastAVest Fest stars Armagor as 
part of unique cultural exchange 



By Sarah Jakacky 
Features Editor 

Gila Almagor, who was chosen as 
actress of the decade by the Israel Fihn 
Institution and Yedoith Aharonol 
newspaper in Israel, will be perform- 
ing in Fort Wayne on Tuesday, 
Almagor will be performing her auto- 
biographical play "The Summer of 
Aviya." 

The play describes the compelling 
life Almagor lived as a child of a holo- 
caust survivor. 

"The audience will learn and gel an 
understanding of the dynamics of the 
children of parents who are survivors 
of the holocaust. Many of them carry 
very serious emotional scars," says 
Vivian Lansky, executive director for 
the Fori Wayne Jewish Federation. 

"We hope to accomplish a cul- 
tural exchange and get to know 
each other. " 

-Almagor's mother is an outcast 
because she has mental problems, so 
Almagor was brought up in foster 
homes and institutions. The play lakes 
place during one summer when the 
mother and daughter lived together," 
says Lansky, "It's about the closeness 
of two people." 

Lansky says the play is important to 
everyone because few understand what 
many Israelis have been through, and 
what they are still going through. 

"Today in Israel they don't have the 
security that we have. They are so 
careful and are so leary of peaceful 
settlements for this reason," she says. 

The main reason the Fort Wayne 
Jewish Federation is sponsoring "The 
Summer of Aviya." according to Lan- 
sky, is to inform people about different 
cultures. 

"We hope to have a cultural 
exchange . The play will be an 
exchange between the Middle East, 
which is Israel, and Ihe Midwest, 
which is us," Lansky says. "We hope 
to accomplish a cultural exchange and

Dy Chris Colcord 
Staff Writer 
To say that Oliver Stone's "JFK" is a 
little hysterical is like accusing the 
Bible of being a little righteous. Tlie 
movie Lt an impassioned pica, and like 
all of Stone's impassioned pleas, it 
requires a huge grain of salt. 

Ostensibly based on Jim Garrison's 
trial of Clay Shaw, "JFK" is really a 
composite film version of all the con- 
spiracy books that have been written 
since 1966. Stone credits two of them. 
Garrison's book and Jim Maars' 
"Crossfire"; but he's obviously read 
them all. Unfortunately, he can't dif- 
ferentiate between Ihe plausible and 
Uie loony. 

"JFK" mentions nearly every con- 
spiracy theory possible before settling 
on the most paranoid. Namely that 
Oswald didn't do it, but the govern- 
ment and everybody else. 
When Stone starts using terms like 
"military-industrial complex" and 
"covert governments", and tries to link 
the three major assassinations of the 
'60s (John F, Kennedy, Robert F. 
Kennedy. Martin Luther King), I start 
'thinking about that stoned guy in 
"Wood stock" who blamed the CIA for 
imaking it rain during the concert 

Much of "JFK" is provocative and 
'despite the mammoth poetic license 
Stone takes with the facts, the 
irrefutable evidence presents blasts the 
Wancn Commission Report's findings 
into disrepute. 

But just when you decide to beheve 
"JFK", the movie starts accusing every 
authority figure short of God in a wild 
and paranoid rant that undermines any 
of Stone's persuasiveness. Even sup- 
portive conspiracy freaks - the hard 
cores - will have trouble swallowing 
"JFK"s premise. 



Obviously "JFK" isn't fad. As fic- 
tion, it's a pretty exciting story, told 
with verve and grit. 

Much has been made of Stone's 60s 
fixation, but "JFK" has more in com- 
mon with Stone's edgy "Talk Radio" 
Uian with "Platoon" or "The Doots". 
Bodi films take place in Dallas; both 
films arc based on two outside sources; 
both films are menacing stories that 
deal with paranoia and assassination. 
And both films are jarringly effective 
when they stick to their tableaux, 
shock radio in "Talk Radio" and the 
assassins' trial in "JFK", but they are 
horrible when they try to get personal. 

All of the scenes in "JFK" with Sissy 
Spacek and the Ganison family are 
bad. Wincingly bad. It's obvious what 
Stone is trying to do - show direcUy 
how JFK's murder affects a "typical" 
American - and it's equally obvious 
that Stone should never write relation- 
ship scenes again. It unleashes some 
of the banmiiest scenes and dialogue in 
modem cinema. The topper Costner 
Md Spacek reuniting their lost passion 
right after JFK has been killed. 

Stone has two Oscars for directing 
and one for screenwriting, but he still 
can't create one decent female charac- 
ter, or a believable familial atmo- 
sphere. 

More importantly, though, the 
domestic scenes slow down conspira- 
cy narrative. Nobody going to see 
"JFK" cares anything about the Garri- 
son family trauma. The audience

tionally than wc do to things." she 

says. "They are fine actors, and Gila 
Almagor will be playing both the part 
of herself and the pan of her mother." 

Lansky urges everyone to attend the 
Fort Wayne performance of "The 
Summer of Aviya." She says it offers 
insight into another culture, and 
because Almagor is a highly acclaimed 
actress. Another added bonus is that 
Almagor will answer questions from 
the stage after the performance. 

Not only was Almagor chosen as the 
actress of the decade in Israel, but she 
has been honored with at least 15 odier 
awards included among her distinc- 
tions are best theater actress and best 
fdm actress, 

Almagor has also appeared in leading 
television and film roles in die United 
Stales.

wants the dope siniighl. 

Tliere is a lot of information given in 
"JFK", some of it provocative, some of 
it implausible, some of it laughable. 
But the movie is never boring, even at 
its most ridiculous. Stone knows how 
to push a story along; despite the 
bogus domestic scenes. '■JFK"rarely 
lags. 

Kevin Costner handles the service- 
able main role like a trouper. Despite 
his limited facility witb accents, 
although his "Nya Arleenz" is better 
than his Robin Hood of Omaba, he 
manages to give Garrison some unde- 
served dignity. 

The supporting cast is the true acting 
standout here, including some knock- 
out cameos from Ed Asner, Walter 
Malihau, John Candy, Jack Lemmon, 
and best of all, Donald Sutherland. 
These old pros give "JFK" the juice it 
needs when Stone takes a misstep; 
since Stone can't go two scenes with- 
out creating a groancr, they arc respon- 
sible for much of die Tilni's credibility. 

So, what we've got here - inspiie of 
Stone's lofty intentions ■ is a pretty 
good conspiracy flick. A S40 million 
B movie. Hollywood's biggest since 
"Scarface."

Vaughn scores 30 
Mastodons beat Ashland 



By Jim Walker 

Editor in Chief 

- IPFW held off an Ashland second 

half surge lo beat ihc conference foe 

106-92 here Saturday nighi, 

Afier trailing by 10 poinis, 85-75. 
wiih five minulcs to play, Ashland 
went on an 11-4 run lo cut tbc margin 
to three poinis. 89-86. The Mastodons 
answered with a 7-0 run which includ- 
ed a long three-pointer by Eric 
Vaughn. 

IPFW extended the lead from that 
point on, with Ashland never coming 
closer than six points in the n;maindcr. 

Vaughn helped keep IPFW ahead by 
scoring nine of his game high 30 
points in ihc final four minutes of the 
contest. Scan Gibson, who had 27 
points in the game, also contributed 
big in the late minutes with six poinis 
in the last four 

Gibson hit six of six free throws in 
the laie minutes. He was 15-16 from 
the line for the night. Gibson also 
added a game high 16 rebounds. 

Ashland came into Fort Wayne Sat- 
urday with full possession of first 
place in the Great Lakes Valley Con- 
ference. By beating the ISlh ranked 
Eagles, IPF\V now shares first place as 
both teams boast a 5-2 conference 
record. The Mastodon win improves 
their overall record to 12-3. 

IPFW head coach Andy Piazza said 
he expects his team to show the kind 
of composure they had against Ash- 
land. "When you have four seniors and 
eight Juniors its easier to keep your 
composure. We expect that from all of 



those veterans," he said. 

"The kids played really bard defen- 
sively, especially at the end when 
every ball possession was imponant." 
he added. 

Piazza was also pleased with the play 
of his postmen. Gibson led ihc way 
inside with two blocks in addition lo 
his game high scoring and rebounding 
totals. Gibson also got some help 
from fellow big men Doug Reinckc 
and Pat Murphy. Reinckc scored 10 
poinis and had two blocks and Murphy 
came off the bench for six rebounds 
and five points in 19 minutes. 

"Gibson was very, very good in the 
first half. In the first half he has 17 
points and 10 rebounds," Piazza said. 
"Our post players are good inside. 
Those kids have staded for us for three 
years now." 

The Mastodons out rebounded Ash- 
land 46-31 and out shot them 50 per- 
cent to 40 percent from the Field. "1 
thought our shot selection was very 
good. Wc didn't have a lot of forced 
shots." noted Piazza. 

"Wc took care of the ball against 
there press when wc needed to and did 
a great job on the defensive rebound- 
ing. We limited them to very few sec- 
ond shots." 

IPFW travels to Northern Kentucky 
tonight Piazza said he expects a fight 
from the GLVC rival. "They are a very 
good team. Everybody in our confer- 
ence is good," he said. 

After a three-game road trip, the 
Mastodons will return home to face 
Southern Indiana on Feb. 6.

Volleydons lose to Rutgers in three 




By Joe Htershe 
Sports Editor 

The Volleydons advanced to the 
championship match at ihe Penn State 
Invitational, only to lose to Rutgers in 
three games by the score 15-13 in each 
contest. 

IPFW defeated Penn State 17-16. 15- 
12, 13-15. and 15-10 to advance to the 
final match. Penn Slate's loss to the 
Volleydons marks ihe first time IPFW 
has beaten Penn State on its home 
court. Also, it is the first lime Penn 
Stale has been denied a chance lo com- 
pete in the championship match at 
their own toumamcni. 

The match was played very well by 
both teams and was a strong win for 



the Volleydons, according to IPFW 
coach Amie Ball, 

Ball attributes Rutger's ball control 
and hustle as deciding factors in their 
victory in the championship match. 
"Rutgers is not as big a team as IPFW, 
but they played a better match". Ball 
said. 

George Mason finished third defeat- 
ing Penn Stale in the consolation 
match. 

The Volleydons continue their sea- 
son on Friday, Jan, 31 and Saturday, 
March I in the IPFW Invitational. 
Ohio Slate, Penn State, and USC will 
compete in the first home match for 
IPFW. 



By Jim Walker 
Editor in Chief 

Boosted by a career night from Pam 
Edwards, the IPFW Lady 'Dons 
tromped Ashland 91-72 in a home 
game Saturday night 

The Lady 'Dons improve lo 12-3 
overall and 6-1 in the Great Lakes Val- 
ley Conference. IPHV remains in sec- 
ond place in the conference behind 
unbeaten St, Joesph's, 

Edwards led the Lady "Dons to their 
seventh straight win with a career high 
31 points. The junior center also 
grabbed a personal best 18 rebounds. 

"1 just look it to the hole." Edwards 
said after ibe game. "They played a 
physical game and 1 like to play physi- 
cal." 

Edwards was especially pleased with 
her night on ihc glass, "That makes me 
the happiest. The points are nice but 
rebounding is my main focus." she 
said. 

It look a while for the Lady TJons to 
find a focus during Saturday's game. 
Even though IPFW finished ihe first 
half up 45-37, head coach Eileen Kle- 
infelter was not satisfied. She said she 
was disappointed with her team's 
inside play. The Lady "Dons were oul 
rebounded 20-19 in the first half. 

But IPFW turned things around in 
the second 20 minutes, out rebounding 
Ashland 32-18, The Lady 'Dons fin- 
ished beating the Lady Eagles 51-38 
on the boards. 

"Two things could attilbutc to our 
adjustment. Number one, wc talked 
about it at half lime in a major way. 
We talked about how we needed to get 
better position for the boards," Klein- 
feller said. "Secondly, wc took off our 
presses. That brought our defense in 



and put us in better rebounding posi- 
tion." 

Along with Ihe rebounds. IPFW 
found the bottom of the net more in 
the second half The Lady 'Dons out 
scored Ashland 46-35 in the second 20 
minutes. IPFW led the Lady Eagles by 
at least 10 points for the last 16 min- 
utes of the game. 




Edwards 



Kleinfelter said the key lo IPFWs 
win was the second half charge, "Our 
goal was to increase the intensity in 
the second half and play some good 
sohd man to man defense and get the 
boards," .she said. "We did that." 

Lisa Miller added 16 points, six 
assists and 10 rebounds to the IPFW 
attack. Shelly Sands and Tma Menier 
had 1 1 points each. 

The Lady 'Dons travel to Northern 
Kentucky for a GLVC contest tonight 
IPFW will be back home on Feb. 6 
when they play conference rival Ken- 
tucky Wcsleyan.
