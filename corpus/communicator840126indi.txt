PACE 2 - THE COMMUNICATOR - JANUARYS, 19M 



opinion 



Autonomy sought 
for Indy campus 




The Slate University of Indianapolis — 
think about ii for a moment. The idea 
isn't so far fetched. If Sen. Lawrence 
Borsl, H- Indianapolis, has his way. 
Indiana-Purdue, Indianapolis will be 
renamed the State University of 
Indianapolis, on June 30. 

Positive points and negative points 
exist for a school such as IUPUI to break 
away from its two parent schools. One 
good point would be it could set its own 
policies without the fear of Bloomington 
and West Lafayette always looking over 
its shoulder. 

A negative point would be lack of 
recognition. How many students will 
drop out ol SUI and transfer to another 
Indiana or Purdue campus? Afterall, a 
degree from either Indiana University 
or Purdue University probably carries 
more weight to a prospective employer 
or graduate school than does a degree 
from SUI. 

An independence move is also under 
way at Indiana-Slate, Evansville. Ball 
SUtc University was once an ISU 



With these two independence moves at 
this time, how long will It be before 
someone seriously attempts to make 
IPFW the Slate University of Fort 
Wayne? Such a move isn't too far- 
fetched. A bill was proposed to the state 
legislature during the 1970s to make 
IPFW Independent of Indiana and 
Purdue universities. 

IPFW seems to have an identity crisis. 
Many people think of it as a starter 
campus or a junior college. Maybe in- 
dependence would do away with such a 
crisis, maybe it would make things 

IPFW is not a starter campus. A 
person can gel a degree in nearly 100 
programs without ever going to another 
campus orschool. The campus is a great 
asset to the city and to northeastern 
Indiana. Ii is our belief that for right 
now, IPFW remain part of Ihe two 
parent schools regardless of how hard 
they attempt to control its destiny.
