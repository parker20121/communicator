The major problem wllh ihe 
schedule as llcilsis is that wllh spring

"The fear Is that some students 
never get hack to studying," sa id Haw 

Having a two day break in spring

"The slaff didn't have enough Umi

Another propoaal made by Ihe 
calendar subcommittee of the 
educational policy committee would 
have shortened the semester by one 
week. lengthening Mondny- 
Wcdnesday-Frlday classes lo u 
minutes and Tuesday-Thursday 
clasMS loBO minutes 

This schedule was recently put Into 
effect alBloomlnglon, Haw said. 

The major opposidon to such a 
change came from faculty who felt the 
extra bme could not be used ef- 
fectively In their curricula. 

"They felt Ihey could not leach as 
much and therefore woild be less 
effective." Haw sal±

Commoner addresses IPFW audience 
on the issue of continued survival 



By CRAIG MX 
SUIT Writer 

Barry Commoner recogrSiea the 
quality aC Eurvlval. He even said thai, 
(jue to the number of commuleis, tt&gt;e 
survival of tPFW was a "unique ac- 
complishment" In his leebjre, 
"ScienceandSodalVahies," however, 
Ik aiktrosed the Issue upon which 
survival depends. 



Commoner's appearance a I IPFW 
on April 15 was the first in the Guest 
Scholar Pnignm- The program was 
co-sponsored by IPFW and the Quest 
Club, a Fori Wayne men's 
OTgsnIiB tion lhal focuses on com-

Commoner viewed present political 
policy ai a threat to science, hmeever. 

"Very important issues are being 
cmfused wilhait Ixing openly 
discissed." he said. Prom cost beneTil

'Commoner cited the govemmenl's 
recent policy of decreased avallabllily

ment will not allow for the freeflow cf

foreign governments will pickllup.

Earlier break 

may combat burnout 



Anyone whose grades suffered from 
(pnng semester bumoul syndrome this 
year might be happy lotearn the Faculty 
Senate has dijcldwl lo move spring break 
to the middle til the semester next year 
and for the l9a£-19S7 school year 

TTierearc. of course, a lew drawbaclts 
Id the new schedute For exampte, IP- 
FW's spring break will no longer 
correspond lo area elementary and hlgti 
Khool spring breaks, which may make 
famlty vacations difficult for some. And 
no doubt there are people who can come 
up wilh many more problems with the 
new system. 

But overall, wc think the pros of 
having vacalionamontheariler than we 
did this year outweigh any negative 
aspects. 

Remember "mid'Semcsler break" of 
this year — designed to give students a 
chance to surface the ocean of books. 
tenn-papers. tests and quizzes for q 
momentary gulp of air in the long 
stretch to April? Well, an extended 
weekend Is Just not the name as the real 



thing. There is really no chance for 
students to get caught up with assign- 
ments and still have time ID relax tiefore 
ihe undertow drags them back down 

And besides, it's depressing when all 
of one's high schMl chums come tume 
for a day or two from Bloomington or 
West Lafayette with deep, dark tans 
ihcy got from five days in Florida, when 
one is still ghostly pale from library- 
project pallor 

By the way, speakingof vacations end 
grades and such — summer vacation is 
almost upon us, which isgood. However, 
thai means f inalsare even closer, which, 
unless you're a genius or a masochist, is 
not so good. 

We therefore feel it our duly lo remind 
you of last semester when you did not 
sleep for 72 houn straight trying to cram 
for your exams and were comatose for 
the first three days o{ Christmas 
vacation. Just something to think about, 
OK? Try lohavea nice day anyway.

Nazi survivor speaks

ByFARILJALN 

Sta It Writer 

Abraham Pasternak, n survivor of the Naii death camp 
at Auschwitz, specie lost Thursday at IPFW as the United 
States observed HolocousI Memorial Week. 

At a raws conlerence iMfore his lecture, Pasternak was 
Bsked to eipress his fhoughls concerning President 
Heogan's plans to vlsU a Nail cemetery rather than a 
concenlrallon camp. He said Ihe men who were hurled 
Ihcrcwerc "not soldiers righting a war, Just klUer?," and 
added (he "presldenl triedloerase atrocities, youdoo'l 
[orgel millions and millions of people aller forty yxars. 
You don' t forge t them after 400 years. " 

Pasternak, now a Dctroll businessman, was about 20 
years old when he, along with Uie resl of his lownD[]S,DOO 
people, were herded tike calUe Into tioxcars and taken to 
Auschwitz. Though only atiout 40 people were In nt- 
lendance at his lecture, Pasternak said thai nationwide, 
there are "not enough speaken to talk" to groups "more 
wlhancxer"
