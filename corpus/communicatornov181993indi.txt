AIDS Awareness: 

Students need to be concerned 



Professor lectures on 
90's black plague 



"How Many Mote Friends Can You 
Afford To Lose," was the title for the 
topic of discussion last Thursday 
evening, hosted by Delta, Sigma Pi. 
Dennis Cannon, chair and assoriaie pro- 
fessor for psychology, gave a brief and 
informative discussion on the topic of 
AIDS awareness 

Cannon described the complexity of 
the AIDS virus through its 

ty lo mutate frequently wbicb 
makes it very difficult for scientists lo 
match antibodies or any type of vaccine 

"Remarkably, the virus itself is not a 
living virus. The only way the virus sur- 
; and replicate) is to invade other 
cells. When its bos! is deceased then the 
rims no longer is able lo replicate or 
arrive," said Cannon. 
Throughout the discussion, Cannon 
addressed several questions as to what 
the letters of the acronym AIDS stands 
for and the basic ideals surrounding the 
virus itself. 

"There is still so much thai we do not 
know about the virus, but we do know 
asual contact is not a probable way 
of contracting the virus." said Cannon. 

Cannon explained that even when one 

does contract the virus, it usually takes 6 

2 weeks (o develop the antibodies

â– The first cases of AIDS were sited in 
June 1981. Toe symptoms of the disease 
were so unusual and first were sited in 
several gay men. Tbe disease was labeled 
the gay cancer." said Cannon 

This type of labeling not only made het- 
erosexuals feel as though they were not 
susceptible to the virus, hut it also encour- 
aged the gay bashing trend that escalated 
during this time. Currently there appears 
to be a rise in the eases of HfV throughout 
the heterosexual community, and a 
decrease in Ihe homosexual community.

5,000 cases of AIDS were in ehildrei 
under the age of 1 3. 

"Those that have been diagnosed for 
AIDS bavc ranged from 2 to 87 years 
old." said Cannon. 

Having served on the AIDS Task Force, 
Cannon explained, "I have lost a number 
of friends due lo AIDS. Anything thai I 
can do to gel Ihem lo change, I will."

Mitochondrial Eve lectures presents 
information on origin of humans 



By Eta .i.i McgowD 

Chief Reporter 

Scientists bavc been debating for years 
tbe location where man, originated. 

Robert Gillespie, assistant professor 
of biology, discussed tbe issue of the 
Mitochondrial Eve. The whole theory is 
associated wilb tbe hypothesis that 
Asia, Australia, Europe, and New 
Guniea all originated end migrated 
from tbe Mitochondrial Eve, in South 
Africa. 

A scientist, Allan Wilson, came up 
with the hypothesis through analyzing 
tbe mitochondrial DNA. Since mito- 
chondrial DNA is only maternally 
inherited, his research outlined the idea 



that all humans were linked back lo a 
single woman 200,000 years ago in 

Critics and scientists, along with pro- 
fessor Gillespie, feel as though the 
research and its data are not completely 
valid. 

"The study bad a few loop boles, for 
example having Afro -Americans to rep- 
resent or lake part in experiment, 
instead of using Africans," said 
Gillespie. 

When asked why be felt this way and 
the reasoning behind bis statement, 
Gillespie responded by slating, '"That 
Afro -Americans can not really be a true 
representative for Africans and this is 
something that 1 do not wish to go into 



this al the present lime." 

Unfortunately. Wilson died before 
he was able lo finish this research. Due 
to the criticism that Wilson received, a 
group of his students decided lo do 
more research that would support his 
findings, 

The students decided lo conduct the 
experiment by collecting blood samples 
from different women Their conclusion 
that all of these women evolved and 
originated from the African Eve of 
South Africa. 

"Eve may have had a quick kick on 
Ihe backside, but the oul-of-Africu 
bypolhcsis certainly isn't dead," said 
Christopher Stringer of the the National 
History Museum. 



IPSGA update 

Bill to change structure 
of Senate not accepted 



The Indiana Purdue Student 
Government Association meeting 
began immediately with IPSGA 
Student Body President Rajat Suri 
calling Ihe meeting to order. 

There were enough members present 
for quorum. 

Suri's president report contained 
information regarding Campus 
Calendar events and the scheduling of 
a meeting next Monday to vote in the 
amendments that were presented dur- 
ing the meeting. 

Terry Richardson, vice-president of 
legislation, bad nothing to report. 

Vice-President of Student Affairs 
Mclinda Williams informed tbe 
IPSGA of SAB's yearly conference, 
National Association for Campus 
Activities, held in Peoria. Illinois. 

NACA is a National Conference 
in which schools meet lo discuss three 
areas: education, showcase, and exhib- 
it hall. 

Vice-President of Finance Mike 
Heit discussed issuing an executive 
order making the financial guidelines

Dean of Students and Senate Advisor 
Marian Zimmerman presented Ihe 
adviser's report which touched on the 
child care issue on campus. 

She informed IPSGA that the child 
care consultant will began the research 
starting in lanuary 1994 and will con- 
clude with a report in March.

Rajat Suri also made several appoint- 
ments. Jerry Richardson served as par- 
liamentarian of Ibc meeting. Les 
Williams. IPSGA justice on Jud[cial 
Court, will serve as the interim Chief 
Justice until one is selected. 

Bills revolving around establishing 
tbe Finance Committee in Student 
Senate, senate sessions, and qualifica- 
tions for all offices were accepted as 
read for discussion al the next meet- 
ing. 

Bills not accepted for open debate 
were KX,M,N. and O. 

These proposed amendments would 
change the structure of Student Senate 
by eliminating the Internal Affairs 
Committee; creating an IPSGA 
Investigator and Rules Committee. 

"1 hope there is a chance for Internal 
Affairs to explain ihe bills so people 
can vote on Ihem (bills) with an intelli- 
gent vote," Internal Affairs Chair 
Charles Copeland said. 

Vice-President Richardson quickly 
addressed the problem wilh the bill in 
Ihe Good of Order section. 

"I don't believe it would be benefi- 
cial because you arc Inking the power 
from elected people from the student 
body and tbe Senate," said 
Richardson. 

"You're also allowing people (all 
IPSGA members) lo be al the discre- 
tion of someone (IPSGA lnvcsligalor) 
appointed by the IPSGA president," 
Richardson added. 



Child care referral advocate 
fired for unknown reasons 



Controversy surrounds 
Deere's termination 

By Fred Douse 

Editor-in-chief 

and Ramona Mcgown 

Chief Reporter 

"Deb Deere was terminated as of 
Nov. 12, 1993," according lo a letter 
issued last Friday by Linda Johnson, 
coordinator for women and reluming 
adults. 

Deere was the child care referral 
advocate for students at IPFW. 

The reasons for her termination arc 
no I clear. 

The Communicator contacted 
Johnson on this issue. Sbe replied that 
she could noi comment on the situa- 
tion. 

"I really don't know how you wanl 
me to explain something that I just 
simply cannol go into." Johnson 
replied. 

However in ihe "to whom il may 
concern letter" given to Deere, 
Johnson stated, "If you have ques- 
tions, please do not hesitate to contact 

Marian Zimmerman, dean of stu- 
dents and director of career services, 
staled that Johnson lold her Deere 
asked Johnson to write the letter. 

The letter, which was given to The 
Communicator by Deere, could be 
used to document termination of 
employ men I. 

Zimmerman is also the chair of the 
Child Care Task Force. 

Zimmerman said she received an E- 
mai! message from Johnson explain- 



ing that after Deere and Johnson dis- 
cussed issues concerning Johnson, 
Deere resigned from her position on 
Friday. 

"I did noi resign," said Deere, "I do 
noi understand why I was fired and 
the issues were no! clearly defined to 
me. I am confused as to why I was 
fired and I do not understand what 
ramifications these issues have on my 
job." 

On Monday, Deere gave a presenta- 
tion to Indiana Purdue Student 
Government Association on the child 
care referral service. During this time, 
Deere was under the impression that 
she was acting as Ihe child care 

Deere said she believed she was 
"still Ihe child care advocate." 
IPSGA is currently undergoing a 
financial investigation of the child 
care referral budget. 

According to Mike Heit, vice-presi- 
dent of finance, student government 
allocated 513,000 lo the child care 
referral service to provide a wage for 
ihe advocate, and pay for telephone 
bills, postage, and office supplies. 

"I need to look at the whole pic- 
ture," said Rajat Suri, student body 
president. "Student government will 
be looking into this issue. I have 
already asked Phil Davich for budget 
and audil statements for the referral 
service lo find out where the student 
service fee funds are going." 

"I honestly don't know whether she 
resigned or not. I do know, if she 
hadn't resigned, she would have been 
terminated," Zimmerman stated. 



Weather Advisement 



In the event the campus is closed due 
lo adverse weather, announcements 
will be made on College Cable Access 
Channel 6, on other local television 
and radio stations, and on a recorded 
message at 481-6050. When possible, 
decisions about closings will be made 
by 3 pjn. for evening classes and 6.30 
am. for daytime classes. Individuals 
on campus will be asked to leave and 
to remove their vehicles so parking 
lots may be cleared. (If n 
ment is made, you may 
campus is open.) 

Because fPFW serves a large regi 
weather conditions in different ar 
may not be ihe same as those at th 
campus. Ultimately, it is the student' 
responsibility to determine the poter 
tial risks involved if there are hoi 
ardous driving conditions. 




Volleyball coach shaves head 



Heffron keeps to 
Volleydons 

By Aaron N. Thompson 
Sports Editor 

Tim Hcffron's IPFW Women's 
Volleyball team encountered many 
close shaves en route to the Great 
Lakes Valley Conference 

(GLVC)Cbompionship. However, none 
was as close as the one tbat Heffron 
himself received. 

Heffron, who started his tenure as 
coach of the Volleydons at Ihe begin- 
ning of this season, had his bead shaved 
by his team members. 

"I told them they could do it as moti- 
vation when we potentially had nine 
gomes remaining," said Heffron. 

According lo the way that Ihe 
Volleydons played in Ibose last nine 
games (which were alt wins), the moti- 
vation worked. "Certainly, at the 
beginning of tbe season, most people 
were looking at us not even getting ten 
wins or reaching .500, but I bod a suspi- 
cion that once tbey had gotten through 
the first month and a half, they would 



begin lo ilounsh. " Heffron stated. 

"Statistically speaking, we shouldn't 
even be in tbe gym! This team was not

tall and did not have incredible athletes. 
Heffron stated. "However, this team 
has incredible heart." 
This enOausiasm for the game shone 
through in the GLVC tournament Even 
though IPFW did not have the firsi seed 
in the tournament, they were definitely 
the favored team going in, because of 
their winning streak. 

Heffron said, " Northern Kentucky 
played us much better this time, and I 
really don't know bow we won... .They 
physically dominated us. but we bung 
in there and sneaked out wilh the win." 

Tbe Volleydons bavc used this strate- 
gy all year. "We stole several victories 
by playing consistently," commented 
Heffron. 

The reason why the team played so 
consistently is mostly due to the way 
practices were held. "Our drills helped 
them play under pressure, where they 
knew if they didn't win. they would pay 
the pnee. We're still not athletically 
great, we just play great volleyball."

Students need to be aware 
of AIDS epidemic in society 



"Society is in denial about the 
sexuality of young people" 



It'i shocking, but it's true. 

ii kiUt many. 

ll lave* thousands more southing for 
Ihe answer why. 

Ii doesn't discriminate again si anyone- 
gay, straight, black, while, man. woman 
or child. 

Anyone can become HIV positive. 

Onc HIV/AIDS expert, Judith Deutch, 
said lhat AIDS has become a discrimina- 

According to a study done by Harvard 
University, 25 percent of the people sur- 
veyed believe that the people who have 
contracted the HIV virus deserve to have 

How can anyone deserve lo contract a 
disease that will eventually kill them? 
No one wants to die, or at least lhat is 
speculated. 

Recently on campus. Dennis Cannon, 
chair and osscocialc professor of psy- 
chology, lectured on AIDS. A virus is a 
small unit of genetic information that is 
wrapped in a protein coal. A virus, such 
as one we get when we have a cold, is 
not able to reproduce without a host cell. 
The host cell, once attacked by the HIV 
virus, fails lo function normally and the 
cell did. 

Sexual intercourse is the most common 
route of transmission. The problem we 
face is that sex is a voluntary act for 99.9 
percent of us, and unless you and your 
partner have had no other partners since 
1980 (how old were you back then?!) or 
refrain from sexual intercourse until you 
are both tested, then each of you are run- 
ning a risk of contracting the disease. 

Another way of acquiring the virus is 
by contact with infected blood. This is 
still a significant risk among healthcare 
professionals when treating patients, but 
they lake every precaution to eliminate 
the risk of contraction for themselves. 
And for patients, blood screening has 
almost eliminated the possibility of 
receiving infected blood through a trans- 
fusion and many doctors encourage self- 



blood donations before non-emergency 

The lost known way of contracting the 
virus is through IV drug use. When a 
baby's mother is an IV drug user and 
HIV positive, increases that child's pos- 
sibility of aquiring the vims by 30-50 

Society is in denial about the sexuality 
of young people. According lo polls 
taken in high schools, fifty percent of the 
teenagers in America (approximate age: 
16 years old) admit that they are sexual- 
ly active For the 50 percent not active, 
abstinence is the best policy, but for the 
other 50 percent, that's probably not a 
viable option. Most people continue hav- 
ing sex once they start. 

Education is the key for responsible 
living. HIV. the most deadliest of all 
sexually transmitted diseases (STD's), is 
not the only STD that is incurable. 
Herpes and genital watts are two other 
diseases that can be controlled, but not 
cuted. Many gynecologists believe that 
there is a link between genital wans and 
cervical cancer. Don't kid yourself and 
think that it can't happen lo anyone you 
or I might know. There is a case in 
which a young woman who had untreat- 
ed genital warts. 24 years old, died from 
cervical cancer. Her doctor and her fam- 
ily warns college age women to be sure 
and be treated, as research points to a 
predisposition to cervical cancer if one 
has genital waits. 

Let's get back to AIDS and the impor- 
tance of taking necessary precautions. 
The nitty-gritty is that the AIDS virus is 
much smaller than sperm and that it's 
important that condoms and spermicide 
be used concurrently to both prevent 
pregnancy and avert contracting any 
STDs. 

Common sense AIDS awareness is a 
matter that every young adult should 
know what precautions to take to protect 
themselves â€” for their own safety, as 
well as the safety of others.

Letters to the editor 

Snyder succumbs to change in theatre department 



In response to the unprecedented 
attention being given recent changes in 
the Department of Theatre 
(Communicator 11/11/93), I would like 
to take this opportunity to clarify some 
mis - conceptions and correct certain 

Most importantly, both the front page 
news story is well as the letter to the 
editor by Mark Hart leave the impres- 
sion that the fifty or so theatre majors 
at this university are unhappy with the 
recent personnel changes and/or the 
leadership of the new Dean, Dr. Gerald 
Ratliff. This is simply not true. There 
exists a small coterie of four or five 
disgruntled students who have had dif- 
ficulty separating personal from profes- 
sional relationships and, as a result, 
selfishly â€” capriciously" as Mark Hart 
would suggest of Dr. Ratliff degenerate 
recent changes in the Theatre depart- 
ment based on how those changes 
effect the few, without regard to the 

A great deal of the controversy has 
centered around the decision to not re- 
appoint Neil LaBute as a faculty mem- 
ber in the Theatre Department, and the 
impact of that decision on our depart- 
ment vis a vis the "playwriting empha- 
sis." First, anyone with even the most 
rudimentary or elementary critical 
thinking skills would understand that, 
as the playwriting credential will 
remain a part of the job description for 
Mr LaBule's vacated position, there 



ebeer 



sfac 



related lo the decision to terminate Mr. 
LaBule's contract. Secondly, and as 
was pointed out by Dean Ratliff at his 
meeting with students (but suspiciously 
absent from either the Communicator's 
story or Mark Hart's letter), there is but 



â– â–  single student 
declared a playwriting emphasis! 
Therefore when Mark Hart consistently 
and continually makes reference to 
playwriting "students" one must seri- 
ously question the vetcity of his state- 
ments or the seriousness of these bud- 
ding playwriics who have remained 
unknown and virtually invisible within 
the Theatre department 

As for the factual reason's for Mr. 
LaBule's dismissal, Dean Ratliff stated. 
again at the aforementioned meeting 
with students, that Mr. LaBule's posi- 
tion required an educator having the 
necessary credentials to teach not only 
playwriting, but acting and directing as 
well. Assistant professor LaBute does 
not have those credentials. As a result 
be is not qualified to teach in each of 

requirement of his position. Dr. Ratliff, 
upon further questioning, explained 
that any factors beyond those stated 
which might have been a part of the 
decision regarding Mr. LaBute could 
not be divulged due to confidentiality 
and professional courtesy â€” a decision 
that I think Neil LaBute would wel- 
come. As to the nature of those other 
factors one can only speculate. I would, 
however, suggest that when a playwrite 
continually chooses to direct bis own 
plays which, based on the lack of box 
office success, are not popular, and 
when other well known plays, directed 
by qualified directors not only sell out 
but require the adding of additional 
performances which also sell out such 
as was the case with our recent produc- 
tion of "HAIR", then one must question 
the credibility of such an individual. 
One must ask whether such a decision 
is based on what is good for our theatre 
program, or simply an exercise in self â–  
aggrandizement and ego fulfillment? 



During Mr LaBule's tenure be ha 
continually chosen to direct primarily 
those plays which be has written with- 
out regard to their financial or artistic 
success and with little concern to popu- 
lar appeal. And yes, theatre is a popular 
entertainment and as such requires on 
audience for both artistic and financial 
reasons, Without "asses in the scats" 
you do not have theatre, you have mas- 
turbation: mental, intellectual, artistic, 
or otherwise. 

As to Steven Sarratore's resignation 
as Chair of the Theatre Department, I 
cannot and would not question his stat- 
ed reasons. Mr. Sarratore's tenure as 
Chair of the Department was in fulfill- 
ment of a phase of our department 
which has now ended. As he stated, he 
feels that a that particular phase of 
development has now been successful- 
ly completed, bis work as Chair has 
likewise been completed. That he feels 
he can no longer lead the Theatre 
Department in its next phase of devel- 
opment is an honorable, forthright, and 
professional decision made not for per- 
sonal reasons necessarily, but for the 
good of the department I am sure. And 
while Steve Sarratore will be on a sab- 
batical during the spring semester, we 
each look forward to his return ncxl fall 
when be will resume his teaching and 
design responsibilities 

Finally, and in conclusion, let me state 
lhat Ihe vast majority of students in the 
Theatre Department not only like Dean 
Ratliff. but support and applaud the 
direction he plans to lake our depart- 
ment in its next phase of development. 
Not only does he forsee increased 
opportunities for students to practice 
their art, but be sees the Indiana - 
Purdue Theatre becoming a beacon of 
excellence not only in this city or state, 
but a theatre program of national recog- 



nition. In just the few short months that 
he has been here he has already re- 
established the summer program which 
after a twenty-five year tradition in this 
community was allowed lo cease two 
years ago. Now, again, the tradition of 
summer theolre will resume, providing 
not only opportunities for theatre stu- 
dents to work at their craft, but also 
providing this community with summer 
theatrical performances which have 
been sorely missed by the theatre - 
going public at large. 

I think what has been mast upsetting 
of all for Ibis theatre major is that we 
now have a Dean of the school of Fine 
and Performing Arts who has repeated- 
ly stated that the students are at the 
center of all that be does; that the 
University, the School, and each 
Department is here to serve the stu- 
dents rather than the other way around, 
and that while proving this philosophy 
with actions be is being painted as an 
uncaring or impersonal administrator 
by a handful! of disgruntled mil - con- 
tents who, for the most part, arc ihe 
least involved students in the Theatre ' 
department. 

Yes, there arc going to be changes, 
but without change we simply maintain 
the status quo and that status quo has 
meant stagnation for our department 
over the past several years. I for one 
thank Gerald Ratliff for bringing bis 
progressive vision to the Theatre 
department over the past several years. 
I for one thank Gerald Ratliff for bring- 
ing his progressive vision to the 
Theatre Department, applaud him for 
the difficult decisions be has bad lo 
make thus far, and publicly pledge to 
him my support-

bu didn't hear it from me but. 




You didn't hear it from me buL.. there 
were little rumblings going on in the 
IPSGA meeting this week- Senator 
Charles Copeland made bis feelings 
known regarding the failure of bills 
proposed to eliminate Internal Affairs 
from Ihe Senate. 

He basically told the members lhat 
they needed more information before 
they could make an intelligent deci- 
sion. Now, I being Ihe person I am, 
immediately found the humor in it 
because it was so blunt, nice and hon- 
est However, if I were an IPSGA 
member, I would have been pissed off 
because the comment really did nol 
need to be said. 

Now I ain't one to talk about nobody, 
but other members of IPSGA took 
personal offense to what be said and 
fell like it wasn't even needed. 

However, I don't think we should just 
haul off and bold a grudge against 
Charlie. He was communicating effec- 
tively with Ihc members, but not tact- 



fully. Now, I am by no means the most 
tactful person in the world, just ask my 
staff. 1 tell like it is. However, in that 
more formal setting, if you will, the 




only thing be had to say was, "I hope 
you will give Internal Affairs an 
opportunity lo explain Ibc bill, so you

Oh, well. Charlie. I wouldn't worry

Why was Deb Deere dismissed as the

if Linda Johnson knows why? 

Why does Kokomo have a facility

Why is an academic department in

These arc just questions that I think 
you, the students, need to start asking,

Students 
offended by 
cartoon 

To the Editor- 

Tbe cartoon thai appears in Ibc November 
4 edition of the Communicator was very 
upsetting 

We were quite offended by the cartoon 
depicting two males guessing ibe weight of 
another student. We find that rude and 
demeaoing behavior. Furthermore, we 
don't understand how such a biased and 

newspaper that is at least somewhat politi- 
cally enlightened- This cartoon re-empha- 
sizes the stereotype thai size has something 
to do with one's personal value. 

I am suie thai we speak for the majority of 
ihe IPFW student body when we say thai 
this cartoon docs not represent ibc way we 
view otben. 

We also ihink thai it is important lo men- 
tion lhat The Communicator is distributed 
to campuses across the Midwest and is this 
shallow image die way we want IPFW stu- 
dents to be ponrayed?

Letter continued Student quotes Harper's Magazine 

Professor upset with editorial 



To tbc editor 

I attended the recent lecture given by 
Dr. Sniderman and came away with a 
completely different impression tban 
[bat portrayed by coverage in the 
November 1 1 Communicator . My feel- 
ing leaving the lecture was primarily 
embarassmtnl that people either did not 
listen carefully to wbat was said, or 
were incapable of analyzing and under- 
standing the research findings; most 
questions following the tallt were sim- 
ply not relevant to the research. There 
are so many quotations out of context 
and inaccuracies in the Communicator 
that I bardly know where to begin. The 
editorial, in particular was extremely 
loose with its interpretation of what was 

For brevity, I will limit responses to a 
few items in the articles: 

- "NEWSFLASH: Racism no longer 
exists?" - I did not hear Dr. Sniderman 
say nor imply this. To the contrary, be 
specifically said that about 10% of 
whiles can be classified as racist and 
further went on to state that this repre- 
sents a substantial exposure to racist 
attitudes if one out of every ten contacts 
a black might have is with racist atti- 

- "The audience seemed to fee] oth- 
erwise." (Regarding Dr Snidermon's 
findings of a correlation of tolerance 
with education.) - This statement is 
probably true. The audience for tbc 
most pail expressed feelings and spoke 
anccdotally with little apparent factual 
support 

â€¢ "Sniderman became very defensive 
and evasive " "When Sniderman was 
confronted with a statement from the 
crowd, rather than actually bearing and 
analyzing wbat the person had said, 
Sniderman was busy trying to think of 
an effective technique to persuade that 
person think otherwise." - My impres- 
sion was thai he was trying bard to be 
diplomatic and respond to questions that 

research I believe he beard and under- 
stood the questions, but knew that the 
questioner had not beard and analyzed 
what he (Sniderman) had said. It is 
extremely difficult to be direct when 
questions are not related to the topic one 
is prepared to discuss. As attendees at 
professional meetings can attest, a 



tomed to challenges 
ods and conclusions of his/her work, but 
the â– 'challenges" at IPFW were outside 
the scope of Dr. Snidcrman's research 

- "One must wonder whether 
Sniderman's research pertains more to 
the principles of persuasion rather than 
the issue everyone else wbo attended the 



led to dis 



Although this statement is poorly con- 
structed and unclear, 1 think that I agree 
with it, at least in pari It seems to be 
saying that the audience bad a precon- 
ceived notion of what it wanted to talk 
about and was upset that Dr. Sniderman 
was talking about his research, rather 
than about what the audience wanted to 
hear. This is summed up by the quote 
attributed to Professor Richard Johnson: 

" the audience was talking apples, 

and he was talking oranges." 
Unfortunately, the audience for the most 
part had no clue. 

- "Here is a scholarly man wbo states 
that, if one is educated, then that person 
will be open - minded as well as racially 
tolerant." - This statement is patently 
false. There was no implied cause - 
effect relationship in Dr. Sniderman's 
research; his was a descriptive use of 
statistics. He did say that the single best 
predictor of tolerance is the number of 
years of formal education. This state- 
ment does not imply that "if one is edu- 
cated, then that person will be open - 
minded..."; additionally, it says nothing 
about if, or to wbat extent, [be formal 
education system is racist- That was not 
port of the research reported. 

- "He also forgets to acknowledge 
the fact that because of racist attitudes 
towards people of color." - The research 
as described by Dr. Sniderman bad 
nothing to do with curriculum. It was 
concerned with investigating attitudes 
and did not attempt to survey behaviors 
or policies of individuals or institu lions. 
He could not "forget" what the research 
did not investigate. 

The lecture touched on many more 
points, and for those interested. Channel 
6 is planning to broadcast a tape of the 
lecture in December. I encourage those 
interested to tunc in.

To the editor: 

Upon reading your editorial in the 
Communicator (10/28/93) regarding 
the Denny beating trial. I felt com- 
pelled to reply to several statements 
and implications to which I Lake excep- 

Firsi, the generalization made by your 
professor (with which you agreed) that 
whites are "taught to be racist." I, as 
well as the majority of whites in (his 
nation, have not been taught to be 
racist - quite the opposite is true. This 
is not "just a fact of life," and 1 resent 
those who wish to lay this guilt upon 
my shoulders. 

Second, the notion that, for fear of 
further violence, destruction, and may- 
hem the jury rendered the "light deci- 
sion to protect the lives of not only the 
people of LA., but the United Slates," 
(i.e., "no justice, no peace"). The func- 
tion of our courts is to find justice in 



each specific trial, not to suspend thai 
justice because a specific group of 
society "deserves'' payback for a histo- 
ry of oppression. This terrible scar on 
our nation's history does not give 
license to riot. In order to maintain 
both jusuce and peace the courts must 
return to their proper function and riots 
must be dealt with separately, as 
described in the following article, 
written in response to the worst riot in 
our nation's history - the draft riot. 
New York City. 1863. 

Excerpt from Harpers Magazine. 
August?, 1863 (no byline): 

"We ought to leant from it, what we 
should have known before, but com- 
munities like individuals, learn noth- 
ing, except from experience, that riots 
are the natural and inevitable diseases 
of great cities, which must be treated 
scientifically upon logical principals 
and with the tight of large experience. 

"In old cities where the authorities 



Downside of smoking addressed 



Dear Editor, 

The leading cause of preventable 
morality in the United States is tobac- 
co smoke-related diseases. Lost year 
over 434,000 individuals died from 
smoke-related diseases. Sadly, a rela- 
tionship between smoke abuse, and 
Heroin and cocaine abuse has also 
been demonstrated. 

Conservatively, thousands, if not tens 
of thousands of individuals (of the 
larger number) died from environmen- 
tal tobacco smoke or secondhand 
smoke. Smokers pose a particular dan- 
ger to individuals who suffer from 
heart, or in my case, lung disease (I 
have never smoked), as well as a dan- 
ger to intelligent and ossumedly 
healthy individuals such as Ms. Porch 



|sec Communicator 10/21/93). 

Smoking at public places, even at 
building entrances, is not a civil right. 
Indeed, smoking at public places is 
increasingly becoming subject to crim- 
inal, as well as administrative, and 
civil remedies. 

Importantly, smokers arc a minority 
and tbey should never be allowed to 
determine the public health majority. 

I.U J\U. Fort Wayne should consider 
designating some smoke free entrances 
at its buddings, as Lutheran Hospital 
has with ill facilities, or building a 
smoking shelter like Parkview 
Hospital. 

Sincerely.

know how to treat riots and resort at 
once to grape and canister they never 
occur twice in a generation, one lesson 
being sufficient for the most hot - 
blooded rioter. Where less vigorous 
counsels prevail tbc disease is checked 
and covered up for a time but breaks 
out a fresh at intervals of a few months 

"Trie secret is, of course, that by the 
former method the populous ore thor- 
oughly imbued with a conviction of the 
power of the authorities and of their 
ability and determination to crush a hot 
at any cost, a lesson (hey remember 
throughout their entire life. While in the 
latter case, the half -quelled rioters are 
allocated to go home with tbc sort of 
feeling that they may after all be the 
stronger party and the government the 
weaker. 

"Hence it is, that while baton is the 
proper weapon of the policeman in 
times of peace and order, the rifle and 
the howitzer are the only (appropriate) 
weapons in the time of riot" 
The article concludes as thus: 

"If we are to put down our own riots, 



citizens interested in the preservation of 
peace and order must be willing to len- 
der their services. It is due to truth to 
say that the citizens of New York 
showed very little alacrity in respond- 
ing to the call of the mayor and gover- 
nor for volunteers to suppress the late 
riot. Of the four hundred muskets that 
lay idle in the armory of the 37lh regi- 
ment, only eighty found men lo carry 
Ibem, though urgent appeals for men 
were made by the authorities and offi- 
cers of the regiment. 

"We can never expect to keep the 
peace unless we are prepared - one and 
all of us - lo turn out in cases of emer- 
gency and fight." 

Lest one be so rash as to say response 
is racist, be need only realize that the 
rioters lo which [his article refers were 
white, and some of the most vocal dis- 
pleasure wilh Ihe LA- verdicts is heard 
from the decent, law-abiding black 
communities of L.A. 

History [caches us so much - we ought 
to learn from it.

Environment 



Endangered species act continues 



The Endangered S pedes Act 
(Re printed with permission) 

The year 1993 marks (he 20th anniver- 
sary of the Endangered Species Act. The 
aim of ibis liwwu simple, to reverse the 
decades (sometime! centuries) of neglect 
and abuse lhal had pushed many of our 
nation's unique planls and animals lo (he 
brink of extinction. 

In two short decades, there has been 
much progress, bul much more remains 
lo be accomplished. A continued strong 
Endangered Species Act is esienlial if we 
are to preserve our unique natural her- 
itage for our children and our children's 
children 

FIVE KEY FACTS ABOUT THE 
ACT 

I. The Endangered Species Act serves 
vital human needs. 

Some people seem to think that the 
Endangered Species Act puis the interests 
and welfare of plants and animals ahead 
of humans. It doesn't. Rather, the Act 
recognizes lhal long-term human needs- 
for new medicines, improved agricultural 
production, healthy ecosystems, and an 
enjoyable and productive environment 
can best be met if we don't destroy the 
fabulous diversity of life with which we 
share our wodd. The Endangered Species 
Act tries to put into practice what the pio- 
neering con servalio nisi. Aldo Leopold, 
prescribed as the "first precaution of 
intelligent unkcring" to keep every cog 
and wheel in the machinery of life. 



2. The Act has helped put many specii 



back on the road lo recovery. 
Citizens of every slate can sec and enjoy 
first-hand some of the Act's many con' 
servaiion successes. Our notion's symbol, 
the bald eagle, though still endangered in 
moil of the United Slates, is making a 
dramatic comeback. And there are more 
whooping cranes, more California sea 
otters, more peregrine falcons, more 
Aleutian Canada geese, more blown peli- 
cans, and more American alligators alive 
today in the United States than at any 
lime in the past two decades. Moil of 
ihese species are still protected by the 
Endangered Species Act. but they and 
many others arc well on the road to 



3. The Act's many successes have been 
achieved with few major conflicts. 

What is mosl surprising about the 
Endangered Species Species Act is not 
how many major conflicts it has 
spawned, but how few. Although the Act 
has been in place for twenty years and 
now protect) more than 700 species of 
plants and animals, efforts lo protect most 
of them have never created significant 
controversies. 

Thousands of federal and federally per- 
mitted projects are scrutinized each year 
for their impacts on endangered species. 
Fewer than one in 1000 of these cannoi 
be altered or modified to reduce their 
impacts lo acceptable levels. A few con- 
troversies, like lhal involving ihe 
Northern Spotted Owl and timber har- 
vesting in what little remains of the 
ancient forests of Ihe Pacific Northwest, 



capture headlines, but Ihey really reprc- 
seni Ihe rare exception rather lhan Ihe 
rule under the Endangered Species Act. 

A The Act has succeeded because il is 



The portrayal of Ihe Aci as rigid and 
incapable of accommodating competing 
social concerns is simply wrong. The Act 
requires that critical babilal designalions 
be based in part on economic considera- 



When projects threaien endangered 
species, the Act requires lhal reasonable 
and prudent alternatives be pursued that 
allow (he project purposes to be fulfilled 
without jeopardizing ihe species survival. 

Through the mechanism of habilai con- 
servation planning, the Act strives to find 
D balance between development plans and 

In ihe rare case when truly irreconcil- 
able conflicts exist, the Act can exempt 
projects from species protection require' 



5. The Act's successes could be expanded 
with only modest funding increases. 
The core budget of Iheendangered 
species program the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service is aboul 546 million, a 
minuscule fraction of the lotal federal 

For what residents of the nation's capi- 
tal spend on pizza at just one chain each 
year, the budget â€” and, it is fair lo say, ihe 
Act's successes â€” could be doubled.

Are friends worth it ? Travel 




Dear Aim! Louise, 



Hi. I need sonic advice on a currenl situ- 
ation that I am going through. My ex-best 
friend and I have not been talking for 
about a month or so. I came home the 
other day and there was a message on my 
machine. It was my ex-best friend opclc- 
giang for her past behavior of not paying 
attention to me just because some man has 
come into herUfc. 

Anyway, when I decided not to talk to 
her, I was somewhat lonely. It forced me 
to go out and male new friends. Now [hat 
I have o couple of new friends, I don't 
know what 1o do with thy ex-best friend. 
Sure, I miss her, but, I do not want to 
mend the friendship and then have her 
ignore me again. 

What should I do?

Workshop

Features Editor 

Confused about bow to download a 
computer disk? 

For amateur backers, Saturday, 
November 20lh from 8'30- noon, is 
the last cbance to sign up for the 
Continuing Education class, "How to 
Use a Computer." 

This class is designed for the inexpe- 
rienced user and will include hands-on 
learning of computer skills. Its focus 
is a non-technical general introduc- 
tion. 

This course is taught by Ann 
Brown, IPFW assistant director for 
Continuing Education-Credit 

Programs. She has a B. A. in commu- 
nications from Indiana University and 
an M.A. in administration from the 
University of Notre Dame. She has 
taught for two years at IPFW. Prior to 
that, she worked in the computer lab 
at Indiana-South Bend. 

"The class is broken down into word 
processing, spreadsheets, and graph- 
ics," said Brown. "At the end of the 



Well, lugarplurn, you first have to deter- 
mine if you really value your friendship 
and iÂ« it worlh saving. If it is, then go for 
it. Recreate the friendship, but make it 
apparent thai this is the last time you will 
even try to mend something thai may 
already be gone. 

I have a good friend by the name of 
Geraldinc. She would always dump 
Charlotte and I when a new man came 
into her life. Of course, the relationship 
was short became her aged boyfriends 
would die-off pretty soon. She's around 
70- or so. I'm not one to discuss age and 
all. Myself, 1 am a young 65 and holding. 

Anyway, finally Charlotte and I just told 
her like it was. Either you give us the 
attention that we deserve, or you just go 
ahead and spend lime with your old men- 
After a couple of more of her fellers died, 
she decided that two best friends were 
better than going 10 funerals. 

Now, if you feel that the friendship is not 
worth salvaging, I would (ell the ex-best 
friend that you appreciate and value the 
time that you two spent together, howev- 
er you feel it is in your best interest if you 
two remain apart. 

Honey, by all means, I would (ell her the 
truth.

Review: "In the Company of Men" 




Chad (Gear) Markiton) talks over the "plan" lo find the ultimate girl wtth his buddy. Howard (Jonathan Brcuwer). 

Pftolo courtesy of Thealra Oepartmen 



Ai soon as I walked into Ihe Williams 
Theatre, I knew 1 was in for another spec- 
tacular Purdue-Indiana Theatre perfor- 

Wrilten and directed by Neil LaBule, 
assistant professor and director. "In tbe 
Company of Men" portrayed how some 
men arc viewed in today's society. 

Tbe play was about two hours long with 
no intermission, which made it difficult for 
those of us who need that time to stretch or 
use the bathroom. Those are fony-five 
minute. Dot two hour seals. 



The openi 



introduced tbe 



lead rotes: arrogant Chad, wbo was por- 
trayed by Geoff Markilon, and his gullible 
business partner, Howard, played by 
Jonathan Brouwer, had very little chem- 
istry between tbe two of them. 

At lira, I wondered what lbey were doing 
up there just throwing lines back and forth, 
instead of really Listening to each other and 
reacting as actors do. Then it seemed as if 
they were doing poor imitations of Rob 
Lowe and Jim Belushi in the movie 
'About Last Night. 1 

This monotonic mode caused the first 
scene 10 just drag on and on and on. I 
didn't know when lbey were going to 
change scenes. 

Then Ihc derogatory language was just 
loo much lo handle. 1 have never heard so 
many curse words in my life ranging from 



f â€” lo motberf . So, 1 am silting 

there thinking why do they keep on curs- 
ing. Then it hit me â€” this is bow normal 
people interna wilh each other. If you 
don't believe me, listen lo some of your 
friends. Every other word is a four letter 
word, which 1 feel is a reflection of today's 
society. People of today have become so 
lazy with their language skills. It's easier lo 
cuss someone out or use slang than to use 
correct English. 

After surviving tbe first scene, this play 
cornea to life. For ihe next couple of 
hours, 1 am allowed to sit back and escape 
into a whole new world surrounding the 
Lives of Chad, Howard and Ihe people in 
their environment such as (be deaf and 
defenseless Christine portrayed by Kristin 
Johnson. 

Johnson gave an excellent performance as 
tbe deaf female. Her interaction wilh 
Markilon and Brouwer was energizing. 1 
loved ber monologues in which Christine 
revealed ber irue emotions in dealing with 
her deafness on a daily basis. 

As the play progresses, the internal con- 
flict forms into a physical one as Chad and 
Howard on different occasions become 
closer lo Chirstine, emotionally and physi- 
cally. For example, Chad takes Christine 
to a party and kisses her. They began to 
dance and 1 figure thai Chad actually has a 
heart until be looks at his wolcb. 

Howard lakes Christine to an art show. 
Throughout the scene I could sense thai be 
i about something. 



Minutes later be kisses her on Ihe check. I 
could tell he really bad feelings for her. 

Even though Howard has strong feelings 
for Christine, ii is obvious thai she falls in 
love with the manipulative Cnad. By the 
end of ihe play, it is pretty much apparent 
that Chad is the dark side of man. 

There is one scene in which the play- 
Wright's attempt may have been lo moke 
the audience feel some sympathy towards 
Chad by having him expose a vulnerable 
period in his life. During a monologue, 
Chad frankly recalls how his mother 
exposed ber breasts to him when sbe found 
him masturbating. Personally. I didn't find 
any thing sympathetic from Ibis I jusi 
thought it showed thai his family is dys- 
functional which probably 
for some families 

1 feel this play is about tbe dark side of 
men. Tbe side of men that is no longer 
human but animalistic. It preys on desiroy- 
ing other people's lives - mainly, destroy- 
ing women's lives. The playwright does 
Ibis by using tbe two main characters, 
Chad and Howard, who are compelling lo 
find a woman with a disability and take 
advantage of her. By making another per- 



n this i 



i, the 



feel that it will be both therapeutic and 
good for them. 

Inspite of ihe slow beginning, I felt thai 
Ihc ploy was worth going to see. 
Especially, the symbolic ending when 
Howard yells at Christine, "Listen!" 

Clever.

Volleydons 
win GLVC 
Championship 

Aaron N Thompson 
Sports Editor 

The IPFW Volleydons marched to Ihe 
University of Ashland this pasl week- 
end wilh the GLVC championship on 
their minds. They came back lo the 
friendly confines of IPFW wilh the tro- 
phy in hand and a little less hair 
Vollcydon coach Tim Hcffron, as 
promised before the tournament, shaved 
his head after the IPFW victory in the 
tournament The Volleydons registered 
victories over the learns from 
Indianapolis, Northern Kentucky and 
Ashland. 

In the first game, on Saturday , 
November 1 J at 11:00, the Volleydons 
took on the team from Ihe University of 
Indianapolis. The Volleydons were try- 
ing not to overlook any team in this 
tournament, knowing that a loss would 
result in elimination. 
They look care of Indianapolis in an 
almost "business-like manner." The 
Volleydons marched all over them in on 
3-0 sweep, The line on this one was a 
15-11,15-6. 15-12 victory. 
Individually, leading the Volleydons 
offensively was Julie Parrot, Heather 
Teagarden and Jill Lyon. Parrot 
smacked 15 kills while Teagarden had 
14, and Lyon look her usual spot lead- 
ing the team in assists with 42. April 
Bacr. Lyon, and Amy Scbeumann had 
eight, seven and four kills respectively. 
Baer also led the team by dishing out 
four service aces. 

Defensively, Amy Polvado sparkled as 
she denied the opposition three times 
with three blocks. Following in this 
department was Teagarden with two 
blocks. Scbeumann bad 11 digs, fol- 
lowed by Teagarden with seven and 
Lyon with six. 

As a team, the VoUeydons had 52 kills 
on 127 attempts, giving them a .29 per- 
centage. They also bad 48 assists, nine 
service aces, 38 digs and six blocks. 
The victory improved the Vollcydon's 
record to 24-15 overall on the season. 
The neit game took place later that day 
at 6:00pm, and was contest againsl sec- 
ond-seeded Northern Kentucky. IPFW 
bad trouble with this team in their last 
contest in the regular season, and the 
trend continued. Only this time, where 
it really counted, the Volleydons come 
out on the winning side. 
This one was a real struggle, going the 
complete distance with a 3-2 victory by 
Ihe Volleydons. The Volleydons 
squeaked by NK in the first game, 15- 
13, but was out-dueled in the next two 
games by e 30-8 collective score. 
Staring defeat in the face, IPFW gar- 
nered with two consecutive victories on 
the verge of elimination. The final line 
on this one had IPFW winning 15-13, 
3-15,5-15.15-12,15-11. 
Teagarden exploded in this one by 
knocking down 25 kills, followed by 
Scbeumann with 19. Lyon did her part 
by dishing out 52 assists, with Polvado 
and Parrot providing some punch with 



Defensively, once again, Teagarden 
was all over the court as she bad eight 
digs, followed by four or her teammates 
lied with seven. Scbeumann led the 
team with two blocks. 
As a team, the VoUeydons bad 71 kills 
on 193 attempts, giving them a .26 per- 
. centage. They belted out eight service 
aces, 54 assists, bad 41digs and three 
blocks. 

With this hard-fought victory, (he 
Volleydons increased their record lo 
24-15 overall. 

The next match was the one tbat every 
team bad anxiously anticipated Ibe 
entire season, and tbat is, the opportuni- 
ty to play for Ihe GLVC championship. 
However, only two teams get this 
opportunity. This yeor's contestants 
were IPFW versus host Ashland. 
Ashland bad just come off a 3-0 stomp- 
ing over the team from Lewis. 
So. the balile began, and wben it was 
all over, the IPFW Volleydons had reg- 
istered a 3-1 victory. 
IPFW came out firing, but squeaked by 
their opponent wilh a 15-13 final. They 
continued Iheir stride by winning the 
second game 15-11, but dropped the 
third gaem 12-15. With the champi- 
onship on the line, IPFW recovered and 
stomped 15-8 in the fourth and final 
game. Thus, the coronation began. 
Teagarden and Parrot were nearly 
unstoppable offensively as they 
smacked 21 and 18 kills respectively. 
Lyon was in her usual role as she led 

Scbeumann, Baer and Lyon each had a 

Parrot continued her great gome as she 
registered 20 digs, with Teagarden hav- 
ing 12. Four members of the 
Volleydons bad one block apiece. 
Totally, the Volleydons hod 56 kills on 
174 attempts giving them a ,22 percent- 
age They dished out 47 assists and four 
service aces. Tbey also denied the 
offense of Ashland many limes as they 
registered 62 digs. They also attained 
four blocks. 

The victory gave the Volleydons the 
coveted GLVC Champioship and an 
impressive 25-15 record on the season.

A large part of the success also fell on

Without them, the team wouldn't have

Until then, it is any body's guess 
what Heffron will do, One thing is for

takes to make certain that bis team
