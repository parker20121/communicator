The Dortor Is In 



Surviving Homecoming 



Ruperts speaks

The Communicator 



At Homecoming, sports 
weren'i the only entertain- 
ment — a Survivor told of his 
experiences on a game show, 
and royally was crowned. 

After Ihe exhibition vol- 
leyball game, television star 
Rupert Boneham related sto- 
ries of his time on the reality 
series "Survivor," most notably 
his experience of kayaking 
with humpback whales. 

He was "terrified and 
exhilarated." he explained, 
adding that it "scared the heck 
out of me." 

Boneham also spoke of 
the nature of competition, and 
observed the importance of life 
outside the game and the need 
to keep competition in perspec- 

"I was blessed before I 
ever went out there." he said, 
recalling how his experience 
with the whale showed him "so 
many other things so more 
important." 

Boneham also look pan 
in the half-time proceedings, 
and pulled the winning name 
for tickets to see the finale of 
"Survivor." 

In an imitation of the 
reality series, Tamara Cornell 
was the last name drawn, and 
therefore, the winner. She and 
a friend will fly lo Los Angeles 
to see the "Survivor" finale. 

Two finalists also had the 
chance to shool for the Campus 
Car giveaway. This promotion 
will continue throughout the 
haskeihall season. 

Nate Hubley and Angela 
Grabczak were crowned King 
and Queen of Homecoming at 
the game on Saturday night.

Hubley said he felt moti- 
vated by the "lack of involve- 
ment" in the campus to run for 
Homecoming.

Students to deal with finals stress

Unfortunately the month

Finals week. 

Finals week is fast 
approaching and for most stu- 
dents it is a stressful time. 

The fate of your GPA 
hangs in the balance so you 
spend hours studying, only to 
choke right before the test and 
forget everything. 

And don't forget the killer 
cramp your hand gets from fill- 
ing in all of those little bubbles 
on the Scantron forms. 

That's enough right there 
to kill a student's attitude 
toward classes.

have to watch out for is just the

that's really dangerous. Our job 
here is prevent people from

Danielson's objective is 
the safety of IPFW, and while 
accidents happen no matter 
how prepared the campus is, 
things typically smooth over as 
people get used to winter. 

"You'll see a lot more cars

'Steak'ing out my 
own Thanksgiving 



Thanksgiving for some 
meant driving long distances, 
being with family members you 
never see, eating dried turkey 
and gorging yourself on a feast 
that, let's face it, could have 
easily fed three times the num- 
ber of people that it ended up 
feeding. But not for me. 

I've never been a big 
turkey fan. There may be many 
different ways to make it, and 1 
have found some that are "ok" 
(my dad's great smoked turkey 
and deep fried turkey, in case 
you're curious) I'm just not a 
fan of foul. 

So this year, when the par- 
Thanksgiving and left me at 
home (aren't having jobs won- 
derful?) I decided I was going 
to do Thanksgiving my way. 

After all, why willingly 
submit myself to gorging 
myself on food I don't really 
like when I have options? So 
last Thursday (after I got off of 
work, that is) a few close 
friends and 1 sat around and had 
one of the best Thanksgiving 
feasts I have ever been privi- 
leged to partake in: steak and 
champagne. 

I'm sure many of you are 
thinking to yourself, steak and 
champagne? That's not 
Thanksgiving, that's sacrile- 
gious and un-American. Well, I 
can't say for certain, but I have 
the feeling had the pilgrims had 
a choice, they would have much 
rather been consuming thick 
steaks, fresh off the grill. 
Seriously, how thankful can 
you be, feasting on the carcass 
of a dried bird, ripped off tl 
bones? 



Now on the other hand, sit forced into things that you're 

a plate with a thick, juicy t-bone not happy doing. Life is much 

in front of me and I'll be more too short to be worrying about

Why arc girls obsessed

A. Because it's pretty and

are endless. ■ If you get bored 
with how you look, the easiest 
way to change is to change your 
hair. It can also make your look 
change drastically. We're like 
little kids, honestly. Little girls 
play dress-up with dolls and 
change their clothes. Grown-up 
girls play with their hair and 
change the look. What can I 
say? We're never satisfied. 

Q. Why are girls always 
shopping? 

A. You can never have 
too many clothes. Don't let 
anyone try lo irick you. a full 
closet does nol mean no more 
shopping. So many people 
have the same outfits anyway 
that it's hard to have something 
completely unique. The more 
you go shopping, the more 
chances you have of being 
unique. If you have to wear the 
same shirt the next week 
because you haven't done laun- 
dry yet, it's time to go shop- 
ping. Unfortunately, I do not 
have enough money to make 
this dream come true. Until 
that day, I'll have to continue 
doing laundry.
