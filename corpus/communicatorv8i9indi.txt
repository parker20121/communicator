ELECTRONICS 




We want you to hear the new Bose 501 Series II speakers. They 
produce a sound that we feel is surpassed by no other speaker on 
the market, except for the famous Bose 901* Series II, which has 
been called the finest speaker ever made at any price. The 501 
incorporates many of the 901's features, including the Direct/ 
Reflecting principle that gives Bose its unique "liveness" and 
"surrounding" qualities. 

Frankly, these are people for whom no other speaker than 
the 901 will do — people to whom the extra oomph is worth the extra 
money. But there are some people who can't quite tell the difference. 

For these people, we 
heartily recommend the 
Bose 501 Series II. 

Bring us your ears, and 
we'll show you what we 
mean.
