IN COLLEGE AND 
UNIVERSITY GOVERNMENT 



The following article taken from the AAUP Bul - 
letin deals with Student participation in College 
and University Government. Although the article 
is important and highly relevant, it was much too 
long to run in one issue of the paper; so, the 
article will be divided into segments. Your dis- 
cussion on the article would be greatly apprecia- 
ted by the newspaper. 

This weeks installment deals only with the in- 
troduction. The following week will wind up 
with student participation in academic affairs and 
in other institn.tional affairs and the implemen- 
tation of principles dealing with the participa- 
tion. 

Now, the introduction:

and Universities, jointly formulated by the Amer- 
ican Association of University Professors, the j 
American Council on Education, and the Associa-

Did You Know that if 
our campus was located 
downtown and we parked 
on the streets (provid- 
ing we had a 30 week 
school year and only 
went fe hours a day) we 
would have to pay $90 
for pa-id parking I 

Did You Know that 
this school must run^w 
a pretty big electric- 
ity bill during vaca- 
tion. One day I walked 
past one room that had 
its lights on for 5 
hours solid (I got 
tired of counting hours 
and decided to turn 
them off.) The TV 
.classroom on the ground 
! floor stayed on for 23 
'hours and there wasn' t 
anyone in sight in that 
room either. 

Did You Know that 
people actually worked 
here during vacation?

noticed, the sidewalk

rooms has been complet*»

to sink in the mud when 
someone is approaching

Did You Know the 
last time a "Letter to 
the Editor" appeared in 
our paper was in the 12 
issue? Glad every-one 
is so perfectly content 
about paid parking, the 
newspaper, classes,

it gets from paid park-

The Inter-SororityCoun-

jwas much discussion and 
a motion was made to 
accept the cons titutioh, 
However, the motion was 
tablo 1 and the Senate

stating: "this body 
(Student Assembly) will 
take upon itselP" to de-

was passed, 

Ammendments to the 
present constitution 
were the next Item on 
the agenda. All am-

were passed. 

After going into a

voice in the government of colleges anci universi- 
jties," and expresses the hope that the educatio- 
I noa community will "turn its attentxon to an im- 
&gt; portant need." 

The Statement which appears below has been 
prepared by Committee T on College and University 
Government, 

^The purpose of this Statement Is to define the 
principles and Identify several appropriate areas 
of student participation in the government of 
colleges and universities. The Statement Itself 
is based on the premise that students as mem- 
bers of the academic community, in addition to 
their rights set forth in the Joint Statement On 
Rights and r^'reedoms of Students ^ have a distinc- 
tive role which, in respects stated below, qual- 
ifies them to share in the exercise of respon- 
sible authority on campus; the exercise of -ftiat 
authority is a greater likelihood of responsible 
student involvement when students participate in 
institutional decisions through orderly proces- 
ses and to the degree appropriate in particular 
circumstances . 

Most importantly, joint effiirt among all groups 
in the institution --students, faculty, adminis- 
tration, and governing board-is a prerequisite 
of sound government, A further prerequisite is 
that all must see themselves as custodians of 
academic freedom. Like any other group, students 
should have a voice, sometimes the predominant 
voice, indecisions which affect them and their 
opinions should be regularly solicited even in 
those areas in which they hold a secondary in- 
terest. But academic government depends on more 
than the accomodationed diverse interests. Joint 
effort, to be effective, must be rooted in the 
'concept of snared authority. The exercise of 
shared authority in college and university go- 
vernment, like the protection of academic free- 
dom, requires tolerance, respect, and a sense of 
community which arises from participation in a 
common enterprise. The exact mode and extent 
of student participation depend on conditions 
which vary from one institution to another; but 
whatever the area of participation or the form is 
assumes, the need for coopers t.ionancng all groups 
is inescapable. cont. in April 17 issue

question, "How do you 
feel about Paid Parking 
now that we have been 
defeated? "to the stu-

Karen Griggs -I am thor© 
oughly disgusted. If I 
lived in town, I would 
walk, bicycle, or take 
the bus. 

However Since I 

live thirty (30) miles 
from the campus, dir- 
ving in car pools is 
necessary. 

I simply hope that 
the poverty stricken 
student will be able to 
park somewhere, even if 
on the east side of the 
campus, a mile away. 

(Irony: If no free 
parking is provided at 
all, government loan 
money to students would 
;be used by those stu-i 
dents having such loan^i 
Mike Grissom - No one 
except the people in 
student government tried 
to do anything about 
:paid parking before so 
I guess we will have to 
live with it. 
Dave Kruse -With all the 
other costs of school 
I don't see the need to 
pay more money for park-

HOW DO YOU HANDLE HUNGRY MEN? 



by Darrell Parnln 

How do you handle a 
tivmgry raan? You feed 
him a basketball. How 
do you stop a hungry 
man?' If It's ^ary John- 
loz, you don't. He's 
Indiana-Purdue's junior 
forward on the varsity 
basketball squad. 

Johnloz became the 
first Mus tanging Mas- 
todon player selected 
to the ALL-CITY College 
Team. He only made the 
second team, but deser- 
ved unanimous pick to 
the first team. Know- 
ing how other city 
coaches made their 
choices, I was reminded 
of the way in which my 
uncle used to weigh 
hO; s oh the farm. He'd 
put a plank in between 
the rails of the fence, 
put the hog on one end 
of the plank and then 
pile rodks on the other 
end until the rocks bal- 
anced the hog. Then he 
took the hop; off: aa^ 
then he'd guess the 
weight of the rocks. 

As a college sports 
writer I wasn't invited 
to cast a ballot, but I 
darn well wish I could 
have. Gary felt the 
loss of 2i|. games, thip 
season, and he felt the 
victory of only 3. In 
those three games Gary 
afterward told me that 
he thought his play had 
stunk. That grin of 
victory on his face, 
thou/^h, told me Lhereal 
story. Johnloz is not 
just another prettyface 
— his face is tliut ofan 
athlete driving every 
emotion and feeling to- 



ward victory. His play 
is not that of Pistol 
Pete or a Lebanon Rock- 
et. It's the play of 
Gary Johnloz, 

The pla y of Johnloz 
is spirited, scoring at^ 
an average lij.»5 clTpo" 
He held theteam togeth- ' 
er and held himself al- 
most personally respon- 
sible for every loss. 
Sure, he knew that if 
the other players were 
better the season re- 
cord could have been 
better. But watching 
him in the games that 
the Mastodons lost, I 
saw an athlete who 
thought he c ould have 
done more. 

Coming back from the 
Grissom Air Force game, 
I asked coach Altman 
what he though of John- 
loz's play. He said, 
"He (Johnloz) plays 
'basketball.* The C«ach 



was right, Gary does 
play basketball.

The question of con- 
structing parking ga- 
rages was raised. Dean 
Nelson feels this Isthe 
only answer. If we have 
surface parking for the 
next 10 years we would 
have to pave 33 acres. 

Also, Dean Nelson 
pointed out that the 
price per day is stir- 
prisingly low. If you 
exclude the summer' 
months (the permit is 
good through fchft sjjnj... 
niBr though) a "B" per- 
mit is about 12^^ per

is JO^ a day.

Mike Ilkane -I fe&amp;l the 
desigpaers of the campus 
were a bunch of idiots 
when they built the

should have used as 
much space as they 
could for parking in-

I ride a bus and don ' t 
have to worry about it 
but I feel that it 
could have been stopped 
if some of the people 
that do drive would 
have done something a- 
bout it originally.

feel that Paid Parking 

is a pain in the bank 

account to students. 

Why don't we change the 

parking lot into more 

' rooms and dam the river 

i and make it a parking 

lot. Then everyone can 

come to school in cabin 

j cruisers. Paid Parking 

is as ridiculous as my 

last statements.

1 Ply the friendly 
I skies of Europe along;

Gracre ^loyd and the 110 
students and fajrnilies 
of the Regional Ca^ipus 
here in Fort Wayne. 
res, it's up, up, and 
&gt; away on a grand Euro- 
pean tour that is jam 
packed with l8 days of 
foreign travel begin — 
ning July 30 and con- 
tinuing until August 1% 
Beginning the tour 
will be a three day 
stay in Amsterdam and 
will continue to Frank- 
furt. Departing Frank- 
furt the group will 
have a choice of seeing 
Copenhagen or V/est Ber- 
lin (and the Berlin 
wall) . The group will 
rejoin at Rome for a 
few d ays and travel on 
to Zurich. Last stop 
is P^'-^l? and then it's 
back to home-sweet-homel 
One of the good 
things about the trip 
is the price — it's on- 
! ly |87i^-.00. This in- 
cludes all air travel, 
I two meals a day, lod- 
ging and sightseeing. 

But the very best 
thing about this trip 
besides just being in 
Europe is that a stu- 
dent can receive credit 
for it. I.U. will grant 
six hours of graduate 
credit for the tour and 
special classroom par- 
ticipation. Six hours 
of credit is offered to 
undergraduates in the 
fields of education and 
history. A special 
high school program of- 
fers three hours of cre- 
dit in the field of Ed- 
ucation, 



EUROPE 

"The program idea 
bounced around far a- j 
while. The interest ; 
fell in the Education 
Department. Dr. Green 
spearheaded it and set 
it in motion", said Dr. 
Lillich. "It is some- 
thing we'd like to do , 
No one pushed it before 
so we decided to pb 
so we decided to pioneff 
the program", explained 
Dr. Green. 

The two doctors tra- 
veled through Europe 
last winter in a Volks- 
wagen. They traveled 
9,500 mile a in 20 days, 
crossing the ^Ips three 
times. Dr. Lillich 
went on to say, "The 
Europeans told us that 
we were the first two 
Americans to travel that 
many miles in that 
length of time in a VW." 
"The most important 
thing we notice in 
Europe", explained Dr, 
Green, "was the numba" 
of young people that 
could speak English, 
They always wanted to 
talk — they had heard 
I things about the U.S. 
and wanted to know why 
things were so." ,"They 
were misinformed on A- 
merica, though," he ad- 
ded. For those young 
people that did not 
speak English Dr. Lil- 
lich found a special 
way to communicate 
through key words and 
hand motions. They 
will be experimenting 
with this type of com- 
munication with the 
young people of Norway, 
Sweden, etc. this sum- 
mer. 

Project C.H.E.E.R., 



as -crie program is termed, 
stands for "Culture, 
History, Education, En- 
joyable — European, Ren- 
dezvous." There are 37 
seats left. If any I.U. 
and P.U. students are 
Interested please con- 
'tact Dr, Joseph Lillict&gt; 
Dr, Frederick Green or 
Mrs. Grace Lloyd at the 
Regional Campus soon.
