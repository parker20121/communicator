Inside 
The Communicator 



by Jennifer Zartmati 
Chief Reporter and 
Paul Tupper 
Managing Editor 

Kevin Eads. like most JPFW students, 
IS looking forward to selling and achiev- 
ing several goals this year 

As the new president of the Indiana- 
[*urdue Student Govemmeni As-sociation 
(IPSGA), Eads biggest priority is keep- 



mg the student body's voice heard - loud 
and clear 

Eads recently took over the position 
which was held last year by Mark King. 
Me said bis style of presidency differs 
from King's, which is common with 
changing of the guard 

"Right now were busy adjusting to 
everyone's schedule," Eads said 
'Basically I want lo keep things stable 
and going from last year." 



"I am al.so working on putting togeth- 
er commiltces for the year," said Eads. 

One of die committees Eads is work- 
ing on is the Information and 
Technology Commillcc, which has a 
goal of providing Iniemet accessibility lo 
each ^ludcnt by the spnng semester 

"There is a lot ihe Internet can do for 
your educaiionai experience, especially 
wiih research and communicaling with 
other campuses." said Eads. 



Eads said the student government is 
focusing on several small goals for the 
year and slicking to them. 

"We need lo see which direction to 
go," Eads said "It's time to look ai cre- 
ating small programs" 

According in Eads, the biggest issue 
Ihe student govcrrunent may address this 
year is rinancial aid.

Stress influences college performance 




by Jennifer Zartman 
Chief Reporter 

For almost everyone, college hfe can be. well, a little 
overwhelimng 

To some, however, the increased stress and work 
load can be too much loo fasl. The stress, and surge of 
feehngs and emotions, can take over and a college stu- 
dent may feel helpless. At this time dropout rates begin 
10 clunb and thoughts of suicide consume the minds of 
some students. 

A receni national study by Maggie Gillespie and 
Julie Noble largeted a group of high-risk college 
dn^ut students for a study. 

The siudy momiortd students ui several areas of Ihe 
country, bcguining with the fall semester of the year. At 
college, for example, 41 students were labeled 
high-risk due lo high school records, results of ACTT or 
SAT tests and evaluations. 

In the fall semester. 18 of ihc 41 had no concrete 
plan for their college career. AtKtiher portion indicated 
that 25 of 41 had taken one or fewer coUege malhemal- 

Work loads also played a major role in Ihe students 
high-risk naiure Those working 20 to 29 hours per 
week are in extreme risk of losing time or interesi in 
college and dropping ouL 

Ai one midwesiem college cited in the study. 1508 
freshmen students were enrolled ai the beginning of die 



fall, but by the end of that semester 25 students had 
dropped out. By the end of the fall of die sophomore 

1 158 students dropped out ofac!a.ss of 1984 



"In most cases, 
suicidal thoughts 
are brought on as 

a result of 
depression and 

feelings of 

hopelessness," 

Kahn stated. 



Many factors influence a student's decision to drop 
out. including the inability to cope with the stress of 
college, personal economic difficulties and more. 

In some cases, drqiping out of college seems impos- 



sible and Ibe strength to deal with problems appear lo be 
too much. This is especially true, perhaps lo students 
who were high -achievers m high school, said Ada P. 
Kahn in "The Encyclopedia of Mental Healdi." 

Kahn stated suicide is Ihe cighdi leading cause of 
death for those in the 15 to 25 year-old age bracket. 

"In most cases, suiadal thoughu are brought on as a 
result of depression and feelings of hopelessness," said 
Kahn 

Several risk factors slated could be attributed lo Ihe 
changes in lifestyles associated with entering college, 
such as isolation or loss of resources, 

Accordmg to Jan Fawcett, also in "The Encyclopedia 
of Mental llealih," one study hsied the most frequent 
symptoms of 25 college-age suicide victims as follows: 
despondency, fuiiliiy, lack of interest in school work, 
lense feelings, insomnia, suicidal communications, 
fatigue and malaise without apparent cause, feelings of 
inadequacy and worihlessness and brooding over the 
death of a loved one. 

In the case of dropout and suicide prevention, early 
iniervenbon is the key Recognizing symptoms in one's 
self and others is highly effective in combating ibe 
depression and stress related to college. 

Several different resources for stress and suicide 
counseling are available locally Encountering stress 
and depression is noimal. but dealing with il in a posi- 
tive way is extremely important to the success of stu- 
dents everywhere.

by Rebecca Kocnlg 
Surr Reporter 



Being involved in campus activ- 
ilics nils in Ibe gaps college leaves 
for many sludenls One way lo 
become more involved is lo join a 
fralcmiiy or sororiiy The Tinl slep 
in membership IS called n&gt;.sb Ru5h 
is a time when ihe organization and 
a potcniial member familiarize 
thcm.&lt;&gt;elvcs wt\h one anolber 

Tliere are iwo difTcrcni lypes of 
organizaiions currently rushing. 
Those are Ihc business fraicmiiy, 
Delia Sigma Pi; and Ihe four social 
fraternities and sororities. Delta 
Gamma, Pi Beta Phi. Sigma Phi 
Epsilon, and Phi Kappa 'Dicta. 

Delta Sigma Pi is the only busi- 
ness fraternity on campus. 
Members are involved in profes- 
sional events, fund-raisers, and 
community service activities. 
Junior Achievement and Dig 
Brothers/Big Sisters are both recip- 
ienLs of the fraternity's time. Delia 
Sigma Pi is generally run like a 
business. It promotes networking in 
ihe business world, "It has all the 
benefits of being in a club except 
it's nation wide." said fraternity 
member Wendy Savage. 

Currently the IPFW chapter of 
Delia Sigma Pi has ten members 



Nationwide it has 167.000 mem- 
bers and about 230 chapters. It is 
open to fusi semester freshmen up 
to second semester juniors, both 
men and women, majonng ls busi- 
ness Coming to any one rush event 
makes a person eligible lo pledge. 
The next event is a cookoul on 
Sept. 9. at 5p.m-lo 8 p.m. in the 
Walb Pavilion. More information 
may be obtained by contacting 
Wendy Savage al 486-2703 

Both Pi Beta Phi and Delta 
Gamma, the CTTcek social sororities 
on campus, are members of the 
Paiihellenic iwociation. This asso- 
ciation oversees ihe sororities. 
Certain rules and regulations must 
be followed, especially during the 
rush period 

Rusbees are not permitted to buy 
anything for a sororiiy member nor 
arc sororiiy members allowed to 
buy anything for rushec'' Cireek 
members and rushecs may not ride 
in the same car during any rush 
period Greek areas are forbidden 
to rushees except during tours. No 
promise should be made as to 
which group a rushce would like to 
join until after bids are issued 
through panhellenic. After the last 
preference parly, each rushee must 
not speak after the last preference 
party she attends until afier the bids 
are posted. A complete packet of 
information is given lo auh rushee 



explaining the rules of rushing. 

Rush counselors are provided to 
help rushecs figure out which 
sororiiy suits ibem best. Rush 
counselors are to remain objective 
and are noi allowed to show a pref- 
erence to their own sororiiy until 
after rush is over, this includes 
wearing anything that identifies 
them with any group and talking to 
members of the sorority 

The rush pcnod allows a rushee 
lo learn more about all of the 
Greeks. Pi Beta Phi believes in aca- 
demic achievement. According to 
the group, academics are the basis 
for all other aspects of college life. 
They also are well grounded on the 
moral atid social aspects of life. 
They provide services to the cam- 
pus and community. Their colors 
are wine and silver blue. Their 
mascot is the angle, and their sym- 
bol is the arrow. For more informa- 
tion, contact Christy Dayser at 632-

at 6:30 p.m. The first official rush 
pany is Friday Sept. 15 at 6 p.m. 
Everyone is to meet in the Walh 
fireside lounge before Ihe gather- 
ings. 

Fraternity rush is a hitle different. 
Each of the two social fralemtties 
on campus, Sigma Phi Epsilon and 
Phi Kappa Theta, organizes its own 
parties. There is no intci-fraiemity 
organization, equivalent to the 
Panhellenic association, regulating 
rush. 

Phi Kappa Theta's nent rush 
event will be on Sept. 8 at 6:30 
p.m. It will be a cookout with

Many of these organiTations have 
programs to assist members after

should be done before making the 
decision as to which, if any. to join.

"I've beard that there may be

need to do about that and what this 
means on a state or local level." 
Eadssaid. 

If cuts are made to fuancial aid, 
Eads is prcpanng to step in and 
make IPFW's voice heard. Eads,

Rock museuin: proof 
of true art in music 



The Rock and Roll Hall of 
Fame and Museum bas ofricially 
opened and il is siill causing con- 
troversy over iLi existence. Many 
people some of them actual musi- 
cians, feel that by having a physi- 
cal struaure like a museum, il will 
somehow take away from (be 
overall essence and spiiil of Rock 
anJ RoU. This is noi true at all 

Wc arc talking about an an 
form that has successfully adapted 
to (he video age If music video, an 
an form in itself, did =^^^^^^^^^= 
not kill Rock and Roll, 
then surely a museum 

will not be lis demise. yOU CBD DOW 
s a very 



Cleveland, was the one lo com the 
phrase "Rock and Roll." From a 
practical view, the midwest 
deserves a siar-siudded landmark 
such as tbis museum. New York 
and Los Angeles have everything 
see and draw crowds lo their cities. 
The Rock and Roll Hal! of Fame 
and Museum is close enough lo 
us — just four hours away — lo call 
our own. 

The building itself is an incredi- 
ble structure that could be con- 
^^^^^^ strued as art The 
architects, using glass 
windows, buili a 
pyramid-like struc- 
ture that is nothing 



The museum .. ^ .~.j .„.. — , 

positive addition lo ihc SQ0 TuQ fDUSIC short of breathtaking 
genre and should be gn(j jfs hiStOrV. 
taken seriously. It is a 



testament ihat says 
Rock and Roll is a true 
art form thai deserves 
the respect of other 
artistic expressions. 

This museum makes ^""^= 
Rock and Pop music tangible. You 
can now see the music and its his- 
tory, rather than just hear iL And 
you can learn the stories and true 
meanings of the songs. So often, 
we lake a song and lum il into a 
meaning Ihat suits ourselves. This 
museum will give people Ihe 
chance to understand ihe meanings 
each arlisi intended, which may 
have been losi in the translaiion. 

Some have criticized Ihe loca- 
tion of Cleveland. Ohio Bui when 
you think about it. il makes perfect 
sense. Cleveland is Lhe literal birth 
place ol Rock and Roll. Alan 
Freed, a disk jockey working in 



rather than 
just hear it 



The museum 
cenain to give those 
in the rock and roll 
profession prestige. 
And Ihe range of 
inductees includes 
musicians, producers,

promoters and DJ's If there 
seems lo be an omission by the

It is women It seems lo be a most- 
ly boy's club But thai will soon 
have lo change because as history 
progressed, more women have 
made contributions worthy of 
inclusion and recognition 

The museum plans to act like a 
true museum by sending artifacts 
on exhibition touts and by lending 
and borrowing treasures. The 
biggest difference from other 
museums is Ihat the majoniy of ihe

Commentary 



EXcommunicated: Harvard's Inconsistency 



by JefT BrurLson 
Columnist 

When 1 read an Associated Press 
article concerning a student who 
was rejecied from Harvard for hav- 
ing previously killed her mother 
(Journal-Gazette 4/8/1995), 1 won- 
dered whether Harvard had sudden- 
ly revised its admission poLcy. 

No such prohibition was placed 
upon a mass -murderer, Guatemalan 
General Hector Gramajo Morales, 
who graduated from Harvard's 
John F Kennedy School of 
Govemmeni on June 6th. 1991. 

Prior 10 his uncomplicated 
enroUmenl and subsequent gradua- 
tion. Gramajo had been the Army 
Vice-Chief of Staff for Guatemalan 
diciaior Rios Monl. Gramajo 
directed Mont's rural 'counter 
insurgency' operations in 1982 and 
■83. in which over 10.000 
Guatemalans (most of whom were 
nonL-ombaiant Indians) were killed, 
and over 100,000 fled lo Mexico. 

In an interview wiib political 
anthropologist Jennifer Schirmer, 
published in the Spring. 1991 issue 
of Iniemaiional Review, Gramajo 



descnbed the program he imple- 
mented: "We insliluied Civil 
Affairs (in 19S2) which provides 
development for 70 percent of Ihe 
population while we killed 30 per- 
cent." Gramajo also admitted thai 
he beaded ihc commission which 
drafted Ihe 70/30 percent program, 
and thai he was in charge of Ihe 30 
percent pan. 

The conservative Guatemalan 
newspaper El Grafico commenied 
on whai Gramajo directed in a May 
17. 1982 editorial: "Ma^saaes have 
become the order of the day There 
is no respect or mercy shown for 
grandparents, children, or grand- 
children All were exterminaied 
equally How is il possible lo 
behead an eight or nine-year-old 
child? How is il possible for a 
human adull lo murder in cold 
blood a baby of less than a year and 
a half? How is il possible. 
General? Nor is it acceptable to 
murder pregnani women." 

Amnesty International has 
descnbed the Guatemalan military 
record under Gramajo as a "govern- 
ment program of poliucal murder " 
On the same day Gramajo graduat- 



ed from Harvard, he was handed a 
30 page federal lawsuit by a 
process server from Ihe Center for 
ConstituiionaJ Rights, seeking dam- 
ages for "acts of summary exeeu- 
uon. disappearance, lonurc. cruel. 
inhumane or degrading ireaUneni. 
arbitrary detention without trial, 
wrongful death, assault and battery, 
faLse imprisonmcni and intentional 
mllicuon of emotional distress," all 
"carried oul under his orders 
against Guatemalan civihans." 

Some of the atrocities detailed m 
the CCR brief: "People were 
burned with hot irons, sliced with 
machetes, beaien wiih rifle butts, 
and shot lo death in agonizing fash- 
ion. Arms and legs were severed. 
Decapitation and castration were 
commonplace. The soldiers throw 
people m fiery pits and lit churches 
or school buildings filled with peo- 
ple on fire. They burned others 
alive by dousing them with gaso- 
line and lighting them on fire. 

"The soldiers garroied and 
hacked people to death. People 
were hung on poles or from trees 
and suffocated lo death. Others 
were drowned in nvers Pregnant 



women and young gu^ls were raped 
before death. Age was no protec- 
uon Irom the calculated atrocities. 
Elderly persons were tonured and 
set on fire Children were disem- 
boweled in front of their parents. 
Their skulls were crushed with rifle 
butts Soldiers also swung children 
violently into poles and trees. 
Entire families were killed with the 
burst of a machine gun The tenure 
was regularly inflicted m the pres- 
ence o( [be victims' relaiives and 
neighbors. These actions were car- 
ried oul with the approval of defen- 
dant Gramajo and in compliance 
with his orders " 

Considering Harvard's admis- 
sion retraction of a woman who had 
previously killed her abusive moth- 
er, and Harvard's graduation of a 
man who directed the killings of 
thousands of civilians, often in 
much cnicler ways, it is fair to ask 
what criiena Harvard employs in 
killer admission considerations. 
Was the young woman's single 
homicide loo few to satisfy Harvanl 
requirements?

Gay prom '95 




It IS the 

time of year 

again when 

lhe gays and 

lc^blans of the 

-state area 

polish their 

dancing shoes, 

dust off their 

tuxedos and 

air out ibeir 

ball gowns for 

Ihe annual 

Gay-Lesbian 

Dinner Dance 

This year promises to have ihc 

largest turnout yet with an expected 

attendance of over 600 people. 

For those of us who have been 
consistent attendees, this year will 
bring some refreshing changes For 
slaners, a sit-down dinner has been 
planned, wiih menus suited for 
meat, fish, and vegetarian food 
lovers. This is a change from earlier 
occasions when a buffet style meal 
was offered Another change comes 
in the form of eniertainment Tbis 
year. Ibe Indianapolis Men's 
Chorus Ensemble will perform a 
short concen to be preceded by the 
ever popular dance. 

Some of the best aspects of lhe 
Dinner Dance will remain the same 
The silent auction will again be the 
focal point of Ihe evening, raising 
money for the Fort Wayne AIDS 
Task Force. Inc Last year, the 
dance raised nearly $16,000 for Ihe 
organization Things donated for 
the auction come from local lalenis 



and merchants to international 
celebrities Once again, a profes- 
sional i^otograpber will be on hand 
to capture your special evening 

The theme for the evening is 
"Family Values. ABSOLUTE- 
LY!" [t is this theme of family 
lifestyles thai has become an issue 
for gays and lesbians recently Gays 
have been involved in monogamous 
relationships and have raised chil- 
dren since the beginning of lime. 
Last year, I was blown away by the 
number of younger persons who 
attended Some of ibe younger 
guests, notably ages of about six- 
teen, brought same sex dales of 
ihcu^ own When 1 saw this, I felt 
my first iwinge of jealousy towards 
younger gays. I had always wanted 
10 lake a guy to the high school 
dances, but couldn't oul of fear. Il 
was then I realized the world is 
changing, and I hked what I saw 

Let us nol forget that most of 
these couples were in fact residents 
of Fon Wayne, living here logether 
as normal as Bob and Julie next 
door 10 you It is this realm of 
social acceptance of normality thai 
we are seeking 

The importance of Ihe Gay- 
Lesbian Dinner Dance is over- 
whelming Tbis is our chance to 
celebrate our lives as who we arc, 
not whai the world thinks of us. We 
laugh, we dance, we dine.

Auburn • Cord • Duesenberg 
Festival 




by Jancl Tobcy 
Fenturcs Editor 

"Hoi ituffi Hot siuff!" called the 
driver of a red 1931 Cadillac 
Roadster, driving off tbc auction 
ramp The classic car. which was 
"judged the best in the world." 
according lo the auctioneer, haijusi 
sold for $225,000. The driver did 
not want anyone lo scratch tbc 
palm 

The annual International 
Colleclor Car Auction is the core 
event of Ibe Auburn Cord 
Duesenberg Festival held every 
year during Labor Day Weekend 

Gassic car enthusiasts, specialty 
car collectors, and others who only 
get to drool over their dream cars 
gathered in Auburn this weekend 
Some were shopping, some selling. 
all enjoying the ama/ing abundance 
of beautifully polished, well-pre- 
served classic autos. 

"People come from all over the 
worid," said Emily Musser. a repre- 
sentative of Knjse Collector Car 
Auction, 

"We have a lot of European buy- 
ers, a lot of Canadians, and people 
from all 50 stales." Musser said. 

The cai^ that draw the most peo- 
ple arc the Auburns. Cords, and 
Duesenbergs. 

"People are really fascinated by 
the Duesenbergs," said Musser, 

In the Car Corral, the lot where 
cars to be auctioned arc parked for 
display, owners sat next to the vehi- 
cles, often answering questions 
from onlookers.

Soundtrack surprisingly 
refreshing 



by Nol Beckley 
Editor 

At firsi glance the soundtraLk 
from the movie Empire Records 
smells cheesy a.s Berne Ind but j 
closer inspecLon reveals one of the 
most impressive soundtrsuks srnte 
"Purple Rain 

The movie appears to be a cross 
between "Melrose Place," and 
"Saved by the Bell " Luckily, the 
soundtrack sounds better than the 
movie looks The first release. Til 
1 Hear it From You," by the Gin 
Blossoms, has already received 
heavy rotation on MTV, Other 
notable bands appearing on the 
soundtrack are The Cranberries. 
Toad the Wei Sprocket, Belter than 
Ezra and Evan Dando of the 
Lemonbeads. 

Dando recorded an early 70s 
tune called "The Ballad of El 
Goodo." which was originally done 
by the Memphis band. Big Star Big 
Star influenced many of today's 
alternative acts such as Matthew 
Sweet. Soul Asylum and Paul 
Wesierberg. Incidentally, the lead 
singer of Big Star, Alex Chilton 
recorded the number one hit, ""The 
Letter," when he was 16 years-old. 

Both the Dando and Bener than 




Ezra cuts are the best of these 
artists. Belter than Ezra's track 
"Circle of Friends, ' is a bittersweet 
lament about a girl trying to incor- 
porate bcr new boyfriend within her 
own cadre of peers 

Other noteworthy cuts on the CD 
are Please's "Here it Comes 
Again." Coyote Shivers' 
"Sugarhigh" and The Meices' cover 
of Billy Idol's 'Ready, Steady, 
Go" The best song by far Is Coyote 
Shivers' blistering "Sugarhigh." 
This track roars out of Ihe block 
with the lyrics 'They all say she's 
just another groupie slut." 



swap meet where auto accessories 
were sold, and ate festival food 
such as elephant ears 

Bui Ihe excitement was in the 
auction building; 

■'One million two-fifteen. ..one 
million two fifteen. Anybody else? 
Gel ready lo toll it!" Tbc auctioneer 
was speaking of a 1934 
Duesenberg. an impressive, huge 
classic auto 

"Clooosed the bidding right 
here! Let's give him a hand, from 
Las Vegas. Nevada, at one million. 
200 thousand!"

Wr- iJA White? 



by AbhaLaRocht 
Surr Writer 



Silting in Engiiih class. 1 could 
not belp but notice tbe pcrpciual 
stare I was receiving from tbe girl 
silling next 10 mc [ acknowledged 
ber stare wiiti a few bneT smiles 
and continued wiiti my nolc-iaking. 
Afier clavs, the girl approached me 
with a question I was not sure how 
to answer 

"Are you Hispanic or black?" 
she asked 

I ihougbl for a moment, telling 
myself that (he inquiry was inno- 
ceni. 1 lumed to ber, and said I was 
Dcithcr. and smiling. I picked up my 
books to leave. 



Black or white? Which one are 
you? The question might sound 
ridiculous 10 some, Yet. when faced 
with job applications and regisira- 
(itm forms thai ask for boxes to be 
checked without biracial as an 
option, the question could pose a 
major problem 

I grew up ashamed that my 
mother is while and my father 
black Kids from the neighborhood 
would call mc names like "zebra," I 
never felt I was black enough, yet it 
seemed I bad to bully the white kids 
at school into being my friends. I 
realized I had to choose a color, and 
fast I chose black, 

Guys called me "red bone" and 
my girlfriends slapped mc on the 
back and accepted me as a light- 



skinned black woman I finally 
belonged somewhere. 

Now I realize belonging is not 
good enough, I need to be who I am 
without choosing a color. I can 
never be one or the other 

My modier is white 1 aoi proud 
of my French heritage and the sto- 
ries 1 grew up bearing about the 
accomplishments my grandfather 
made in die war. 

My father is a black man. I have 
read "Malcolm X," listened 10 and 
appreciated my grandmother's 
struggles during the Civil Rights 
movement. I do not shy away from 
learning more about black history 

[ am a combination of the best of 
both worlds, I am biracial Hear me 
roar. 








Penetrating 
thoughts. .. 

m 

Ivory 



melaiionships. Not thai 
Miss Ivory ls an expert on 
these thmgs. but m my life 
1 have discovered that rumaniic 
relationships do not last as long as 
friendships. To quote one of the 
greats, "Friendship is stronger 
than love, it lasts longer." Oscar 
Wilde. 

Widi this idea. I have decided 
to put the daiing/sen/commit- 
ment/rclauonship thing off for a 
long white. And it isn't because I 
am not attracted to anyone of the 
opposite sex, it is simply because 
once one becomes involved m any 
kind of relationship ibat goes 
beyond friendship, one. at least 
me, experiences strange complex- 
ities that 1 do not wish to lake tbe 
time 10 deal with at this point in 
my life. 

I have watched some of my 
very close friends literally fall to 
pieces over some guy or some girl 
who was the world to them and 
then POOF!! they are gone and all 
they are left with is the feeling 
that Lloyd Dobbler experienced tn 
"Say Anything" when Diane 
Chord gave him a pen. In fact bis 
response was. "I gave her my 
heart and she gave me a pen." 
Need I say more? 

1 guess at this point if you are 
involved with someone and you 
are truly content, than I am happy 
for and wish you the best But if 
you are not involved with anyone, 
take it easy. Spend some time on 
yourself Try not to spend so 
much lime on finding a relation- 
ship, instead maybe spend time 
, finding yourself 



NATO continued from page 3 

Could the fact the former Yugoslav 
republic was not an oil rich totali- 
tarian puppet state of the U.S. have 
somcdiing 10 do with it? All of diis 
IS a moot point today, because after 
hundreds of thousands of Muslims 
have been murdered in the name of 
racial purity, a powerful response 
has been given. 

Why have the Muslims suffered 
for years before the civilized world 
actually began to take notice? Their 
religion may have been a factor in 
the lack of any resolve by any 
world leaders. The wesieni world 
seems to be in no hurry to help 
Muslims without oil We ousted 
Hussein for tbe oil rich Kuwaiti 
people, but we let Husscm murder 
Kurds in northern Iraq When Iran 
and Iraq waged war against anoth- 
er, we helped out Hussein and bis 
oil refineries 

The world's government have 
woken up to the most obvious fact 
of the twentiedi century They have 
realized the U.N is the second most 
inefficient governing body second 
only to the Senate Ethics 
Committee which contains that icon 
of ethics — Teddy (zip. snap, drop) 



Kennedy 

The U.N. was committed 10 die 
ideal of preventing another world 
war, but by iheir lack of action in 
Bosnia they have only exacerbated 
the problem which has nearly led to 
another war in this century with 
beginnings in Sarajevo. World war 
is still a possibility but at this 
moment NATO's action has 
deterred the likelihood of one; you 
do the math

Sports t^lllor 

Arm cocked and ready lo 
explode on impact with the ball, 
Heulhcr Teagardtn prepares lo 
make her a.vsault upon yci another 
upponeni First however, she must 
attack the books. Teagarden is not 
your stereotypical ^ludent/aihlcie. 
In (acu sbc is anything but stereo- 
typical, ralm and cool naiured off 



Ihc couri, she becomes ruthless 
against the competiuon while on tie 
court Tcag^dcn has achieved 
both in the classroom ai well as on 
the volleyball court while ai IPFW 
A Dean's List student in each of the 
prior SIX semesters. 5he siudies 
business and accounting. She cur- 
rently ranks third on die women's 
volleyball all-lime kills list After 
nailing 60 kills in direc games last 
week, she will move into the num- 



ber two spot before the end of the 
month 

"I came here for two reasons 
First I knew thai I still wanted lo 
play volleyball and I wanted to do 
so close to home. My whole family 
lives in Fort Wayne. I also wanted 
to siudy business and I could do 
that here in an Indiana University 
school," said Teagarden. 

Do not let her cool demeanor 
fool you. On the volleyball coun, 
Teagarden is a force In the first 
three games of the season ihis year 
she tallied 60 kills against some for- 
midable competition Against 
Norlhcrn Kentucky. Teagarden 
nailed 16 kills to warm up before 
striking for 24 kiLs versus Ashland 
Then, to end die weekend of com- 
petition, she lalbed another 20 kills 
against conference foe Bellarmine 

"I dunk that as a team we played 
well. Personally. 1 think diat when il 
counted. I was able to help out by 
getting the side out, especially in 
the fifth game." she said 

It IS obvious Ihal Teagarden is 
happy, both academically and ath- 
letically at IPFW She said she feels 
good about the volleyball learn and 
though It takes a lot of limc-man- 



agemenl skills lo keep up. she is rel- 
atively happy wiih her siudies 

"I am not unlike most studcnLs 
here I have to manage time 
between sports and school, but a lot 
of people have job commitmenis or 
family commiimenK ITs just a 
mailer of having good time-man- 
agement skills. Il also helps that I 
don't have a long commute," said 
Teagarden 

Teagarden and her teammates 
are off to a magmnccnt start this 
season, Uie teams record is 3-0, and 
they only look to improve 
Teagarden expressed the team's 
desire to advance as far as the 
NCAA tournament this season and 
she feels the goal is not so far out of 
reach. 

"Our goal is to reach the region- 
als. To do that we have to go unde- 
feated m our conference and beat 
the other teams in the region We 
will have our shots, we just have lo 
do it," added Teagarden 

As her arm stretches forward to 
meet the ball, die echoing noise of 
her band smacking the volleyball 
fills die gymnasium. She is not die 
stereotypical jock, neither from an 
academic standpoint nor an athlcLc 



siandpoini. By season's end. 
Teagarden will rank among die best 
outside hitlers to play ai IPFW and 
through her humility she admits the 
record is somethmg she is lookmg 
forward to achieving. 

"There is a lot of tra- 
dition here and It's 
great to know that I've 
accomplished so 
much. 1 knew it was 
something 1 could 
accomplish when 1 
came here It'll be an 
honor to be associated 
with the some of those 
names who have played here 
before me It's really neat though, 
beciause a lot of them have been my 
coaches or teammates in oUier com- 
petitions," she said. 

When asked about her four years 
at IPFW, Teagarden said, "Since I 
have been here the program has 
really grown, 

(Coach) Tim &lt;Heffron) has taken 
it to the level where we can com- 
pete widi a lot of the teams nation- 
ally. I think that we play the two 
time defending champions. 
Northern Michigan, as well as a lot 
of other good teams dijs year, and I 



think we will do well," she said 

She is cool, calm, humble and 
Idee a rattlesnake; poised to strike 
when the opponent geLs in her way. 




tidbits: 



tidbits... 

Ok. who called their bookie after 
Norihweslem's stunning win over 
Notre Dame last Saturday? The 
Wildcats may still be a super long- 
shot, at one million to one, to win 
die BIO 10 this year However, 
few, if any. fans thought that the 



Irish would fall to the 'Cats either. 

Rumor has it that an unnamed 
football player at Purdue was 
switched from ccnier lo guard this 
season after a rather messy season 
last year The young man has a rela- 
tively queasy siomach and spilled 
bis guLs. so to speak, on the ball at 



least once last year 

Well the countdown is all but 
over in Cal Ripkin's drive to break 
Lou Gerig's "Iron Man " record of 
continuous games played. Another 
product of the rumor mill stated thai 
Ripkin was thinking about silting 
out ihe 2,131 game, there by keep- 
ing Geng's record intact. What?

Men's soccer hits road to 
Saginaw Valley tourney 



by Jim Porter 
Sports Editor 

On die heels of a second place 
finish in the lUPUl Tournament, 
the men's soccer team travels lo 
Saginaw Valley to participate in the 
Saginaw Valley Tournament this 
weekend This will be the fu'st tune 
the 'Dons have taken part in the 
tournament and Uie competition is 
stiff Saginaw Valley is a NCAA 
Division II leam with a lot of talent 
However, the highest cahber of 
competition for the 
Mastodons will come 
from NCAA Division 1. 
Eastern Michigan, 

"Easieni is a very good 
team. We've always played them 
and until just recently the competi- 
tion has been prcity even, " said 
assistant coach Mark Coffee, "They 
(Eastern Michigan) never get men- 
tioned with the obvious Division 
One teams in the region, bui they 



are a very talented team The 'Dons 
will not travel to the loumameni 
widi out their own firepower, bow- 
ever All-Conference player Mike 
Harper leads a talented, yet young. 
squad into the competi- 
tion and Coffee 
he expects a good 
showing from 




leam, •— 

"We're a 
young team and they still 
make mistakes now an then. 
Against Bellarmine (in the fUPLH 
Toumameni), we made a couple of 
mistakes that cosi us a goal and 
unforiunately il cost us the game. 
Other than diat, we totally dominat- 
ed Bellarmine. 1 think diat once the 
tr^sfers and the freshmen get some 
more experience, we'll be a really 



good team." added Coffee. 

Asked about the level of compe- 
tition he expects at the Saginaw 
Valley Toumameni, Coffee said 
that he knew little about the 
Saginaw Valley team, but 
noted Eastern Michigan should 
formidable foe 
"We should be able lo at 
t hang with Eastern 
Michigan, Mike (Harper) can 
easdy play with that caliber of 
competition He's a good fin- 
isher and has the ability to take 
people on. He's a true offen- 
sive player. Freshman Travis 
Cushing played well at 
Indianapolis, setting Mike up a lot 
and as a result made the All- 
Toumameni team," Coffee said, 

The competition will be tough, 
but at l-l on die season, the men's 
soccer team is defiantly out lo make 
a new name for IPFW soccer. 



Women's tennis preview: 
'controlling goals important' 



by Danielle English 
Staff Writer 

Despite being one player shon, 
the women's tennis team is looking 
good and is full of experience The 
team's roster includes four veterans 
and one freshman. 

"We are still accepting players, 
so come on out, " said Head Coach 
Dan Brogan. 

The number one player on this 
year's team is Latsamy 
Kounbandilh. a recent transfer stu- 
dent 

"Lat is a good player, she has a 
lot of experience She hasn't played 
many matches for a while. Playing 
will be an adjustment for her," said 
Brogan 



Al number two singles is Carrie 
Claypool Claypool has two years 
ofexpcnenc« on the team. In one of 
those years she was the conference 
champion. 

"Caihe is playing belter dian she 
did last year," Brogan added 

The number three player is 
Headier Perzanoski She has three 
years of experience under her bell 
and Brogan said this year she is 
playing quite well 

Al number four singles is Lisa 
Baumgartner and at five is Danielle 
English Brogan commented bodi 
players are quite good and show a 
lot of promise. 

■"Riis IS a new icam and I'm not 
real sure how we're going to do 
We have a lot of fun and get alone 



good We know when to have fun 
and when lo get serious," said 
Baumg aimer. 

Though he had litde lo say about 
the individual pLiyers on the team, 
Brogan stressed goal orientated 
play 

"Players only view success as 
winning and losing. Those aren't 
the type of goals you should estab- 
lish Those type of goals are hard to 
achieve all of the time. The goals 
for a team should be to play hard. 
smart. aiKl be a good teammate," he 
said. 

Brogan said that goals should be 
things you can control, not those 
you can not control. 



Texas Rangers, The concessions 
now carry a "garden burger". It's a 
low fat, low calorie alternative to 
the typical hamburger and it con- 
tains 7.ero meat. The delicacy is 
comprised of soybeans, wheat 
germ, and natural flavors. One has 
to wonder however, does it come 
widia lighl beer? 

Just when the NCAA thought 
that it had outlawed any type of cel- 
ebrating in the end7i)ne, along came 



Jerry Farwell Afier the founder of 
Liberty University filed a suit 
charging ihat the prohibition of end- 
zone celebration denied players the 
freedom to pray after a touchdown 
The NCAA bowed lo a higher being 
and decided that it is not an act of 
showmanship for a player to thank 
die Lord after scoring a TD, 

As the major league base- 
ball season draws to a close, one 
need look no further than the 



American League Central Division 
to know Ihat this year is like no 
other The Cleveland Indians will 
make the playoffs for the first time 
in nearly 45 years. Off in the 
American League East, the Boston 
Red Sox also have a chance to make 
the playoffs. In the first "full" year 
of die re-alignment the Red Sox can 
be diankful that Bill Buckner does 
not play first base any longer.
