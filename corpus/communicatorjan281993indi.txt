Library director faces drastic budget cuts 



By Felicia Keeching 
Edilor In chief 

Larry Griffin, dirccior of IPFW's 
Helmkc Library, piciurcd gloom and 
doom for Ihc library budget ai liic 
faculty convocation on Monday. Jim. 
25. 

The budgeting problems, for which 
he sees no hope, will profoundly af- 
fect services (o students and faculty 
in the near future. 

According to Griffin, Ihe problems 
stem from the unchecked and exorbi- 



1 price inaeases of scholarly jour- 
nals. Most have increased ai a rate of 
15 percent per year for the last 20 
years. 

Many subscriptions for biology, 
physics, and chemiscry journals now 
cost approsimaicly SIOOO per year 
and arc still increasing. These prices 
are killing Uie IPFW library budget. 

"We're on the edge of ctiange. such 
as the inveniion of lypcscning print, 
and, more recently, the invention of 
copier machines," said Griffin. 

"Scholarly journals will have to 



change within the next two to thrte 
years to electronic media, hastened 
by the cancer of scholarly journal 
pricing," Griffin explained. 

Several reasons are contributing 
factors as to why the publishers 
can charge exorbitant prices, 
Griffin proposed. 

Since the early 1970s, college and 
university libraries were encouraged 
to shift funding from books to serials, 
cancel duplicate subscriptions, and 
encourage faculty to cancel personal 
subscriptions if the library carried the 



serial. 

Small university publishers gave 
way to large commercial publishers. 
These commercial publishers targeted 
a specialty in their particular academ- 
ic fields, making their publication a 
key joumali Libraries experience 
pressure from faculty to subsciibc to 
it, regardless of price, according to 
Griffin. 

LPFW library for 1992 spent 70 per- 
cent of the budget on serials, or ap- 
proximately 5180,000. and only 
560,000 on books. 



Most of the book money came from 
the library endowment, approximate- 
ly S40,000-S60.000. which is noi 
supposed to be earmarked for operat- 
ing expenses, but for purchasing spe- 
cial collections, confided anoihe) 
source. 

Griffin painted a bleak future for 
library services for 1993 and be- 
yond. Serial subscriptions will have 
to be slashed by thousands of dol- 
lars; the library will have to de- 
pend more on interlibrary loan; 



No quorum for IPSGA 



By Kay Hinga 
Footprints Editor 

IPSGA held its first meeting of the 
semester on Monday, Jan. 25. Five 
senators were present. Those in atten- 
dance were President Rajai Suri, Vice 
President Elbcri Webster. Senators 
Gregory Bracho and Chris Douse, 
and newly-appointed Senator J. 
William Richardson. 

Since there was no quorum, an offi- 
cial meeting could not be held; how- 
ever, Suri held an informal meeting 
using the agendii for Jan. 25. 

Suri infomifd tlie attending senators 
of his decision lo veto the resolution 
to increase the athletic budget from 
50 percent to 60 percent of the stu- 
dent activity fees. 

"No graduate students' point of 
view was taken," Suri stated, giving 
his reason for vetoing the resolution. 

Suri also told the senators he 
planned to discuss the Educare issue. 



He requested input from the senators 
on the issue of providing a television 
for the lounge in the new Engineering 
and Technology Building. 

Suri hopes to hold "Town meet- 
ings like Perot wants to hold" with 
IPSGA mediating between the stu- 
dents and faculty on the Educare 

Webster look over the meeting, 
and he and Bracho squabbled back 
and forth over placement of u drink- 
ing fountain in the lounge at the 
Helmkc Library. Bracho had several 
other reports he wished to make 
which Webster refused to hear, ask- 
ing instead if Bracho had results. 

Webster also expressed his con- 
cern over the small turnout for ihc 
meeting and asked the attending 
senators to find senators, "who care 
and are concerned" to join IPSGA. 

The next meeting is Monday, Feb. I , 
ai noon in the Walb Memorial Union, 
All students are welcome to attend. 



Dean Bassett resigns 



Ity Den Solero 
Managing Editor 

Abe }. Bassett. Dean of Fine and 
Performing Arts at IPFW, submitted 
his resignation Nov, 11. 1992 to 
Chancellor Joanne B. Lantz. The res- 
ignation becomes effective June 30, 
1993 and he returns to the theater de- 
partment next year. 

"I'm really looking forward to go- 
ing back into ihc classroom." Bassett 
said. "I came into higher education 
because I enjoy teaching." 

Bassett joined IPFW's administra- 
tion as the first Dean of f^ne and Per- 
forming Aas in 1988. During his five- 
year tenure, the School of Fine and 
Performing Arts progressively im- 
proved in several aspects according to 
Bassett. 

"We are much stronger now than 
five years ago," said Bassett. 

"We've improved ourselves physi- 
cally with the addition of two new 
buildings. 

"Each dcpanment has improved it- 
self curricularly. through additions 
and refinements of their programs," 
Bassett continued. "We are known, 
now, in the Fori Wayne community 
and diroughoui NonJicast Indiana." 



Ba.SSClt earned degrees in theater ai 
Bowling Green University on the un- 
dergraduate level and at Ohio State 
University on the graduate level. He 
went on to teach theater in Missouri. 
Washington, and North Dakota, final- 
ly returning to Ohio where he served 
as chairman of the depanmcni of the- 
ater arts at Wright State University in 
Dayton for 18 years, until being of- 
fered the position hcit. 




more money will have to be 
found to support interlibrary loan 
and document delivery services; and 
probably scholarly journals will be 
switching to an electronic media, 
charging anywhere from S5 -S20 to 
access articles and/or fax hard copies. 
Griffin suggested that students, par- 
ents of students, and faculty compliun 
10 the state legislators that more 
books, journals, and services arc 
needed at IPFW. 

Brochure 
returned 

By Felicia Beechlng 
Editor in chief 

Purdue University recently sent an 
18-page brochure outlining its budget 
goals for the main campus and other 
Purdue associated campuses through- 
out the state of Indiana. It contained 
graphs, facts, and figures. 

What it did not contain, until the lost 
paragraph of the last page, was a men- 
tion of IPFW. Tlic proposed Science 
Building was listed as third on Pur- 
due's list of needed buildings, follow- 
ing a biotechnology building at West 
Lafayette and an a dm inis Ira live-class- 
room building for Purdue Calumet. 

An anonymous source told the Com- 
municator that when high level ad- 
ministrators .saw this brochure, they 
were so angered tliat they sent back all 
the copies to West Lafayette, rather 
than distribute them to the faculty. 

The Communicator was able to ob- 
tain a copy of the brochure. IPFW was 
only mentioned in regard to the build- 
ing and in a graph of the proposed 
budgCL 

"Tliis brochure is indicative of Pur- 
due's altitude toward IPFW," said an 
unnamed source. 

The Communicator tried to contact 
Purdue University administrator 
Joseph Bennett and Purdue President 
Bccring, but they were unavailable for 
comment concerning the brochure, the 
proposed IPFW Management Agree- 
ment, and fiscal autonomy.

Higher education students sacrifice 
time and money for the sake of a col- 
lege degree or ceriificaie. IPFW at- 
tempts to alleviate some of the sm- 
dcnts' economic pressures by offer- 
ing a multitude of services. 

Many students are not aware of the 
wealth of financial aid information 
found at the Financial Aid Office 
(FAO). Apart from the federal and 
state grants, work-study and loans, a 
variety of scholarships. IPFNV-spon- 
soted and other types, are available. 

The following are jusi a sampling of 
IPF\V scholarships: Oie Scidel schol- 
arship for students studying agricul- 
tural-related programs, the Lee Edu- 
cation Grant scholarship for educa- 
tion majors, and the Electrical Engi- 
neering Technology scholarship for 
EET majors- The IPF\V scholarships 
are ususally awarded to students rec- 
ommended by the heads of the acade- 
mic departments. Students should 
consult the department offices for 
more information. 

Scholarships from Indiana and na- 
tional organizations offer help for 
those pursuing almost any field. 

The Lawrence A, Ackerman schol- 
arship is awarded to "assist worthy 
students pursuing a career in the 
stewardship of animals." 

The Joan Burmeister Romine 
Memorial Scholarship Fund is given 
to students "pursuing studies leading 
toward a degree in or related to his- 
toric preservation." 

Valerie GrifTiths. of FAO. recom- 
mends thai smdents visit the office to 
investigate the financial aid possibili- 
ties and to search in the scholarship 
books at Helmke Library and the 
Allen County Public Library. 

No longer are students required to 
pay a fee to apply for financial aid. 



The Financial Aid Form (FAF) has 
been replaced by the Free Applica- 
tion Federal Siudeni Aid (FAFSA). 
The forms should be available by the 
end of January at the FAO, Keitler 
109, The priority deadline for the 
1993-94 academic year is March 1, 
1993. 

According to director Gina Roberts, 
"Changes arc being made at the FAO 
and students should be aware of 
them," 

The Indiana-Purdue Student Gov- 
ernment Associauon published a list 
of Fort Wayne area retailers who give 
discounts to IPFW students. The 
booklet, "1992-93 Student Discount 
Package," includes companies which 
offer a range from health care to 
computer supplies. 

Anne-Thercse Delplanque, IPSGA 
student worker, highhghts Computer- 
land as a favorite discounter, ranging 
from 10 -75 percent off their comput- 
er hardware and software. 

"Some stores, after turning us down 
(to consider student discounts) call 
back after reconsidering," said 
Detplonque. 

The free booklet is available ai the 
student government office in Walb 
Memorial Union. Room 225. ID 
holders are also encouraged to ask 
about special rates at retail businesses 
not included in the booklet. 

IPFW ID'S are good for saving on 
tickets to attend movies, concerts, 
theatrical productions, and other 
forms of entertainment. Discount cin- 
ema tickets and Fort Wayne I^lhar- 
monic vouchers can be acquired at

STAFF EDITORIAL 

Services Concealed 



IPFW offers many : 
Students. Students can benefit 
from various activities and pro- 
grams, such as receiving help with 
course work at Transitional Siud- 



With all the services being of- 
fered today, many students seem 
baffled and confused. They never 
realize the extent and the power 
that they have at their fingenips. 

Programs for everyone and iiny- 
onc, yet studcnLs at IPFW have yci 
to take advantiigc of them. 

Whose fault is it? Should the st^i- 
denis be blamed, the services or 
the administration of the school? 

Many students would argue that 
they never knew of the benefits. 
And the students arc probably 
right. 

Il is the job of Ihe various admin- 
istrators of these services to adver- 
tise and announce all that is being 
offered. Yet many of those in- 
volved in supervising these pro- 
grams fail lo take the lime to ail- 
vcrtise the facilities being offered. 

They never go to any lengths to 
promote the services or to explain 
their functions in the IPFW com- 
munity. 

Every student on campus, howev- 
er, is being assessed a fee for these 
services they never gel to utilize. 

What could be done to help ad- 
vertise all ihc services at IPFW? 

There are a couple of different 
things that could be done to an- 
nounce the services. 

1) With all the different cork 



boards accessible throughout the 
campus, bulletins could be posted 
on the what's and when's of each 
service. The bulletin boards are the 
students' primary source of infor- 
mation. 

' 2) Tlie services should come to 
the student so that the students can 
come to the services. The regular 
distribution of fliers with infomia- 
lion about these activities would 
help. 

Time consumption and a small 
amount of money are all the en- 
deavor would need. With all the 
money used to maintain the ser- 
vices for students who never show, 
a couple of extra dollars would 
never be missed. 

Is Uie real one to blame the ad- 
ministration? 

They may claim money is tight. 
They may claim that linancing ad- 
vertising would be a waste because 
siudenus would still not use the ser- 
vices. 

It's the students money in the first 
place. If the students want to know 
what is offered and where their 
money is going, they have a right 
to know. Students should demand 
knowledge of all the services being 
offered here. 

Who is to blame for student ser- 
vices going to waste? Is it the stu- 
dents, the administrators of the ser- ' 
vices, or the admiiusiration? 

With the information at hand, the 
blame seems to go to all three: the 
students, the services, and the 
administration.

! have a lot of respect for vegetari-

but I failed miserably. The problem 
was that the term "vegetarian" im-

"non -carnivore." I failed at that, loo. 
By eliminating both meat (by princi- 
ple) and vegetables (by taste) from 
my diet, I was left with bread,

'Post-born' murdered 



Three limes over the past five 
months, I've been bluntly reminded 
of the local anti-choice movement's 
claimed reverence for life, and the be- 
nign view which most of its members 
evidendy have toward the taking of 
human lives by our country's political 
power elite. 

The first reminder occurred last Sep- 
tember when Oliver North slimed into 
losvn to deliver a fund-raising spiel 
about "family values" on behalf of 
the Crisis Pregnancy Center.

setting up and channeling funds to the 
Coniras in the 1980s. The Contias 
were formed out of the ranks of de- 
posed Nicaraguan dictator Anasiazio 
Somora's National Guard, an organi- 
zation which was notorious for its 
employ of torture and murder to crush 
political dissent. 

The Contras conducted a terrorist 
war against the democratically elect- 
ed Sandlnista government which re- 
placed Somoza focusing primarily on 
civilian targets in Nicaragua. Under 
the tutelage of North and his Central 
Intelligence Agency cohorts, the Con- 
tras engaged in grotesque human 
rights abuses which included the sys- 
tematic tonure, mutilation and murder 
of civilian men, women and children. 
The ClA even distributed assassina- 
tion manuals to these terrorists, which 
instructed them to target democrati- 
cally-elected mayors and other 
Nicaraguan officials. 

North's Comras were also deeply 
involved in the illegal drug trade, a 
fact which is especially relevant when 
one considers that the amount of co- 
caine entering the United States 
quadrupled during Ronald Reagan's 
presidency. North's own notes detail- 
ing Contra resupply operations in- 
clude 543 pages coniiuning drug traf- 
ficking references, with explicit suue- 
menis like "Sl4 million to finance 
(Contra arms) came from drugs," 

North is siill officially barred from 
entering Costa Rica because of his 



role in fostering the Contra drug con- 
nection in that country.

so helped craft a plan to suspend the 
U.S. Constitution "in the event of a 
national crisis, such as ...widespread 
intemal dissent or national opposition 
to a U.S. military invasion abroad."* 

None of this apparently bothered 
North's anii-choicc sponsors here in 
the Fort. You'd think, given their 
paranoid millcnialism, they might 
have at least questioned North's ideo- 
logical alliance with the Washington 
Times. At North's suggestion, the 
Washington Times set up a tax-ex- 
empt organization called the 
"Nicaraguan Freedom Fund" to fun- 
nel aid to the Contras; the Washington 
Times is owned by the Unification 
Church, the leader of which, Rev. Sun 
Myung Moon, claims to be the messi- 



Bombs versus Morning- After Pills 

Blunt reminder number two oc- 
curred last October 15, following the 
presentation ot the film Barefoot Gen 
at our campus. I was mulling over the 
imagery of the film (an animated ac- 
count of the nuking of Hiroshima) 
when I ran into Kent Zicssler, a cam- 
pus staff mcmlwr, for the fringe-right 
religious group Intervarsity Christian 
Fellowship. Kent and 1 had a talk. 
Kent talked about the anti-choice lec- 
turer whose presentation was co- 
sponsored by our theocratic Students' 
Government that evening. I talked 
about the mora) implications of the 
Hiroshima bombing, and the growth 
and abuses of our military industrial 
complex since then. It was clear that 
we didn't sec eye to eye on either 
abortion or war. When I suggested a 
need for reforms to curb military 
abuse, and to steer labor and re- 
sources toward actual human needs, 
Kent countered that efforts by mere 
mortals to address the problem w'cre 
hopeless and that the only solution 
was to give ourselves to Jesus. On the 
issue of abortion, however, he was 
not reliant upon metaphysical solu- 
tions alone; in fact, he was quite 
amenable to the use of mortal means, 
such as lengthy prison sentences (or 
worse) for illegal abortion survivors,

my true nature was that of a hedonis- 
dc carnivore, and I shouldn't try to 
fight it. Besides, 1 rationalized, there 
are much worse things I could be, 
such as a lerrorisi or Geraldo. 

But I still have a lot of respect for 
people who, for whatever reason, 
choose not to eat meat, and are able 
to adhere lo that doctrine without 
contracting a major malnutritional 
disease.

on the virtues of bran. 

As a young bachelor 
living on my own. I 
will be the first to ad- 
mit that I have the 
same diet, nutritional- 
ly, as a person who 
cats sponges. And I 
know all about the nu- 
tritional content of 
sponges, because I 
learned all about them 
in my seventh grade 
Biology class. 

My selective memory 
remembers the gripping in-class dis- 
cussion where my teacher brotight 
up the burning question, "Why don't 
people eat sponges?" (At this point I 
wa.s still reeling from the new-found 
knowledge that sponges are animals. 
1 marveled, are there S.O.S. pads 
frolicking around in the ocean, too?) 
We were all waiting on the edge of 
our seals for the answer: 1) because 
they taste horrible, and 2) because 
they have absolutely no nutritional 
value whatsoever. 

Ever since that day, I've made il a 
point lo cut sponges out of my diet.

That'll intimidate the 
public into buying any- 
thing!" Then they had 
a big party where they 
got drunk and invented 
phrases like "hardened 
arteries," knowing that 
they would have job 
security through the next century. 

Where cholesterol is concerned, I 
am a Deierminist. I believe that we 
are born into this world with our 
cholesterol level predetermined, and 
no matter what amount of bean curd 
you eat and greasy burgers you 
avoid, you can never escape your 
cholesterol level. This is why some 
people, it seems, could take a sy- 
ringe of animal fat and inject it di- 
rectly into their veins and still have 
low cholesterol, while you eat one 
grape a day and your cholesterol lev- 
el is enough to inspire long, fervid

explain all the grease that appears to 
have been specially added to the 
burgers with indusuial grease guns. 

But I'm not totally without princi- 
ple when it comes to food. I once 
bought a package of com dogs just 
because the package boasted to con-

(0 cfTcci his particular soclaJ agenda. 

One can draw parallels bciwccn ihe 
rheioric of anii-abonion rights cru- 
saders and ihc social sanciioning of 
bona fide atrocities by our culiurc. 
Pro-life ideologues rcdundaniiy bclit- 
Ue the decision-making processes of 
women who choose abortion by 
claiming legal abortion is Ihc out- 
growth of personal and socicial and 
denial -- thai an "out of sight, out of 
mind" mentality of casual disposabil- 
ity causes the '"murder" of zygotes 
and fetuses. 

Apparently, very few local anii- 
Choiccrs see any corollary between 
this perspective as applied lo legal- 
ized abortion and Its authentic appli- 
cation toward U.S. oven and coven 
military interventions. Geographical 
distance, disinformation, political 
naivcic', opportunistic nationalist 
demagoguery and ihc sleazy motives 
of 3 small wealthy elite have com- 
bined 10 crcale a permanent war cul- 



ture in our country which readily 
adopts a dehumanizing "out of sight, 
out of mind" altitude toward the pre- 
dominanily non-white populations 
which our war nuchinc has a^icted 
for the past 50 years. 

Which brings me to my third blunt 
reminder. On Jan. 8. the anti-choice 
groups Operation Rescue and Mis- 
sionaries to the Pre-Bom staged a 
protest demonstration in from of the 
downtown Federal Building. I can 
think of many issues worth raising 
hell about in front of federal build- 
ings, but the issue which these people 
dwelled upon is not one of them. The 
two groups, with overlapping agen- 
das lo effect government control over 
women's bodies, operated on this oc- 
casion under the name "Christian De- 
fense Coalition." Following their cue, 
I created my own instant organiza- 
lion-for-a-day, and issued to their 
members the following memo:

Letters to the editor 

Abortion perspective shared 



TotheKditor: 

In the iasi sin years since I've been 
a student at IPFW, I've read much 
about Ihe abortion issue in The Com- 
municator. Some say life. Some say 
dcaih. Some say choice, 1 would like 
to draw some alicntion lo some often 
forgotten and brushed aside factors 
involved in creating this issue. 
Lei's first take a look at ihc fcius. 
It's no secret that evil, roiicn fetuses 
arc invading our planet. They are ex- 
pensive, Lmc consuming and messy. 
These irresponsible organisms are try- 
ing to dcsiroy some people's standard 
of living, I'm sure God above holds a 
special place for the brave men and 
women who wage war against them. 
Their own parents arc proof of what 
hideous things fetuses turn into if 
they are bom. 

. Let's next take a look at the men in- 
volved in this issue. They arc the un- 
sung heroes of the pro-choice cause. 
They include such brave characters as 
Ihe overwhelming nice guy that 
promised to pull oui on time. The 
sharp dressed man in his imponcd hoi 
rod who only wanted to take her for a 
ride, and the authoritative daddy who 
wanted lo gci his money's worth out 
of his teenage daughter. Oh, I almost 
forgot the brave and noble rapist. She 
was even submissive and seductive to 
some of the men. That is, men who 
flew the coop as soon as she lumed 
up pregnant. The brave and coura- 
geous men who lit these descriptions 
have been rewarded well. They've 
paid no penalties iuid surely served 
their master well. I'm sure someday 
ihey will all be rewarded for their cru- 
sading endeavors. The bravery and 
responsibility these gentlemen have 
displayed is imsurpassed by any other 
men t know of. Even the soldiers of 
Desert Storm weren't brave enough to 
intentionally kill babies. 
God alone knows what an awesome 



contribution these people have made 
to society. They've rid society of mil- 
lions of undisciplined children raised 
by incsponsihlc parents. They've re- 
duced the number of children to be 
abused and sexually molested by their 
parents. They have also guaranteed 
more jobs for the tioai people. Good 
job, you fun loving childrenlcss par- 
ents. You've insiu'cd that my children 
will someday inherit the Earth. I'M 
leach my children about Jesus, family 
values, and the Bible. Imagine thai. 
The whole Earth will be Christ 
some day and your children were on- 
ly fetuses. Dead aborted fetuses. 

I decided to also mention thai the 
only way pro-abonionisis can guaran- 
tee their own freedoms of having a 
choice in the future is by giving birth 
10 dicir feiuscs and raise them teach- 
ing them the noble ways of fetus 
abortion. That's right. There's no way 
I'm letting my children be subjected 
to the death teachings of a govern- 
ment run Godless school system. If 
you want to corrupt children, then 
comapt your own. I'm sending mine 
to a Christian school. That's right. 
The only way you can protect your 
children's right to abonion is by hav- 
ing ihemi 

1 agree. We all have a choice m 
everything we do. It's not my deci- 
sion that we all have choices to make. 
It's God's decision. I would not argue 
with God, therefore I also am pro- 
choice. I will choose life for myself 
and my children. I wanted io share a 
little in depth perspective to the pro- 
choice issue and iooV at some of the 
often hidden realities of this issue, I'll 
be waiting for a gory reply and a cut 
down of everything 1 consider to be 
sacred, but don't worry, anything you 
write is not subject to my ji 
anyway. Good luck and besi wishes.

IPFW Student 



For an organization that claims to 
respect life, "Operation Miscue" dis- 
plays an odd set of priorities. Today's 
O.R. demonstration against a pro- 
posed change in U.S. military policy 
is one such display. 

Where is ihis group when the gov- 
crruneni commits acts of miliiary ag- 
gression against innocent people in 
other countries? 

One enamplc: When President 
George Bush decided to "retrieve" 
Panama's General Manuel Noriega in 
Dec. 1989. he did so at the expense 
of an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 Pana- 
manian civilian lives. These men. 
women and children were ftilly-func- 
tioning human beings, with clearly 
developed arms, legs, brains and 
hearts. They exhibited all of the traits 
which we would recognize among 
ourselves as human; they could 
laugh, cry. pray, sing and love. They 
could also bleed, feel pain, scream 
and die. 

Why did they die? The U.S. Slate 
Department claimed the invasion was 
necessary to "promote democracy" 
and to nab a dr\ig smuggler. Granted, 
Noriega was an oppressive thug in- 
volved in the illegal drug trade. His 
links to narcotics networks, as well as 
the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency 
extended back to the mid-i970's. 
U.S. Intelligence was aware of his 
drug involvement then, and later on 
as well, when he was a U.S. puppet- 
ruler on the Reagan administration's 
payroll. If the Reagan/Bush regime 
was sincere about staving the flow of 
drugs into our country and promoting 
democracy abroad, why did ihat same 
regime actively support Noriega 
throughout most of his career as a 
CIA collaborator, drug trader and dic- 
laior? 



After supponing his iinmoral activi- 
ties at U.S. taxpayers' expense for so 
many years, our government abruptly 
reversed its posture and killed thou- 
sands of innocent people - once 
again at taxpayers' expense - in order 
to bag its suddenly-vilified prize. 

The invasion occurred a few days 
after it was publicly revealed that 
George Bush had covenly sent his 
National Security Adviser and 
Deputy Secretary of State to China to 
schmooz with China's totaliiarian 
rulers (who a few weeks before that 
meeiing, mass-murdered hundreds of 
pro-democracy demonstrators in 
Tiananmen Square). 

Conveniently, Ihe Panama invasion 
diverted public attention from the 
news that George Bysh has no 
qualms about Communist oppression, 
and no sentiment for democratic mar- 
tyrs when multinational corporate 
deals with China are ai stake. 

During the invasion of Panama. 
U,S. troops look over every hospital 
and morgue in Panama cily and re- 
moved their registries, effectively 
covering up the scope of civilian and 
military deaths. The Red Cross was 
denied access to El Chorillo, a 
sprawling neighborhood of poor peo- 
ple which the U,S, military torched, 
killing hundreds of civilians and leav- 
ing 15,000 people homeless in the 
process, 

U.S. soldiers buried hundreds of 
bodies in mass graves and were ob- 
served incinerating piles of bodies 
with flame-throwers. The bodies of 
many civilians were foiuid with their 
hands tied behind their backs, shot 
execution-style in the backs of their 
heads.

America had received more than 
1.400 reports of persons still "miss- 
ing" in Panama since the invasion. 

A small number of U.S. soldiers 
died as well during the invasion; they 
were distinct and valuable human be- 
ings, as surely as were the Panamani- 
ans, 

One might hope that people who 
sincerely respect life would (juestion 
the priorities of policy makers which 
lead to mass slaughters like that 
which occurred in Panama. It is rea- 
sonable to suspect that those who are 
committed to preventing the waste of 
human life, and to struggles for hu- 
man rights and dignity would sec 
through the pretest of interventions 
like the Panama operation, and resist 
politicians who promote such actions; 
but "Operation Rescue" is strangely 
blind to post-bom lives which are 
sacrificed to the idol of U.S. hegemo- 
ny. 

In contradiction to its posturing 
rhetoric, 0,R. readily embraces 
politicians with murderous agendas. 
The screams of innocent post-bom 
victims do not peneu-ate the deaf cars 
of O.R's leaders. 

After politely ignoring for yeai5, the 
murder of post-bom innocents by our

who directed the killing, 0,R. lias de-

regard to the mihtary should be to de-

Papaleo serves up a victory 



By Michael Bass 
Sports Editor 

Senior Raul Papaleo was holding 
all [he occs Friday, Jan. 22, when he 
served up 5 aces lo help his icam de- 
Ccai Wisconsin-Milwaukee ai the 
Hiliiard Gaics Spons Ccnicr. 

The match which was the leam's 
MIVA season opener weni lo only 3 
games. IPFW winning; 15-5, 15-10, 
and 15-6. 

Wisconsin-Milwaukee look ihc 
' lead in game I and in game 2. With 
Ihc first game tied at Ihrcc IPFW 
burst forward grabbing 5 points in 
quick succession. 

Ai 9-5 Wisconsin-Milwaukee, af- 
ter taking the lasi 2 points, was 
about to lake ihc momentum when 
Papaleo served 2 aces in row shut- 
ting down the Wisconsin-Milwau- 
kee surge. 

In game 2 IPFW found themselves 
down 4-1, but fought right back into 
it and fmaJly wicsllcd free lo take 
the victory. 

In game three the Vollcydons 
grabbed the first four points in quick 
succession, Wisconsin-Milwaukee 
made one uy closing the game by 1 
point at 4-3, but thai would be as 
close as they would get, 

■' We started off slow, but were 
able to put it together." said sopho- 
more Craig Collins. 

Papaleo attributed his 5 aces to the 
hard work he has put in to become a 
better server. 

"I had a goal to become a better 
server," said Papaleo, "I think I've 
done a good job." 

Along with his 5 aces Papaleo had 
13 kills 10 lead the team. 

Collins played the last two games, 
after coming off a sprained ankle 
that kept him on Ihc sidelines for 
most of the match against Ball State 



[WO weeks ago. Collins had 10 kills 
in those two games. 

'■ 1 fell comfonabtc to gci back out 
[here," said Collins. 

Collins thanks the rest of the (earn 
for getting on him and pushing him 
to gel out and practice. He believes 
the ankle is almost completely 
healed. 

" Wiihin another week or so he'll 
be ready to go full tilt." said Coach 
Amie Ball on Collins. 

Junior Lloy Ball led both teams 
with a lotal of 43 assists. Senior 



Qucntin Spiegel added II kills for 
[he night. 

Friday, Jan. 29 and Saturday, Jan. 
30. the Volleydons will host the Fon 
Wayne Natioruil Bank/ Pepsi invjia- 
tional at the Hiliiard Gales Sports 
Center. 

The Vollcydons will play the 8:15 
p.m game against Penn Stale. On 
Saturday ihcy will face Long Beach 
State again at 6:15 p.m. Ohio State 
will also play in the Tourney, 

"It should be a wild weekend." 
said Ball.

What the stats never tell 



By Michael Bass 
Sports Editor 

This last weekend was a big week- 
end in IPFW spons. There were four 
basketball games and a volleyball 
game all held ai the Hiliiard Gates 
Sports Ccncr. 

It all took place from Thursday. Jan. 
21 to Saturday, Jan. 23. 
Wiih all these activities go- 
ing on, a person could get 
lost in the statistics and no 
one would ever know all 
the players that stood out. 

Having attended every game played 
last weekend. I would like to applaud 
the following players who stood out 
and contributed lo the action thai look 
place; 

Senior Scan Gibson, for a season- 
high nine assists againsi Bellarmine 
and for scoring 24 points. He scored 
27 points against Kentucky State. 

Gibson stands out because of his 
ability to hit hard objects and keep 
going. Against Kentucky State, Gib- 
son led the team wiih crashing into 
things. 

In his spree he hit two walls, some 
chairs, a bar, the floor, and the biggest 
guy I have ever seen named Eric Lit- 
tle. Yet Gibson had the composure to 
lead his team to victory against a 
lough Kentucky State team. 

Freshman Lindy Jones, for brcalcing 
the team record of lield goals made. 
She hit 16 on 20 attempts against 
Kentucky State, 

Jones showed real class by giving 
the credit to her teammates, who she 
said did all Ihc work getting the pass- 
es to her when she was open. 

Senior Raul Papaleo, for serving up 
five aces against Wisconsin-Milwau 
kee. Papaleo also led the team with 
13 kills. 

Junior Lloy Ball, for gathering to 



The ball's 
in my court 



gcther 43 assists, and for being sccm- 
mgly indJspctuable out on the floor. 

Senior Andre Walton, for being 
humble enough to call it luck after 
shoodng 9 for 10 and having 21 total 
points Thursday night againsi Bel- 
laimine. 

Any referee or ofHcia] thai worked 
through the three 
day period deserves 
credit. They had the 
patience and self- 
control to keep 
themselves together and to keep the 
game under conirol. 

Junior Amy Perkins, for being ihe 
great ball handler she is. Againsi 
Kentucky State she had ten assists, 
one away from the team record of 1 1 . 

Perkins should also be credited for 
the amout of time she has spent out 
on the court. Up until the win againsi 
Kentucky Stale Perkins was playing 
39-40 minutes a game. 

Coach Amie Ball, for maintaining a 
building atmosphere around his icam. 
How is it they get better each year? 
When will they reach their peak? No 
one knows but let's hope they contin- 
ue to grow for years to come. 

Junior Scott Simmons, whose three 
pointers may have been the key to the 



Mastodons' victory over Kcniticky 
Suiic. 

Sophomore Craig Collins, for play- 
ing his best on a healing sprained an- 
kle. 

Senior Eric Little of Kentucky 
State. As big as he is it would be im- 
possible for him not to stand out. 

Coach Eileen Kleinfcltcr. for her pa- 
tience and opiimism for her team 
through its rebuilding process. 

Senior Doug Reinckc, who hit 5 of 
5 from the field and 4 of 5 from ihe 
free throw line against Bellarmine. 

The men's basketball team, for 
sticking together and getting the vic- 
tory from an aggressive Kentucky 
Stale team. 

The Lady'Dons, for playing their 
hardest even though ihcy can't win 
them all. 

The Volleydons. for not taking it 
easy on Wisconsin-Milwaukee. 

And finally, anyone and everyone 
who enjoyed any of the games played 
last weekend deserves credit for 
showing their support tor the IPFW 
teams. Because without the fans we 
would have no need for the teams and 
without the teams I wouldn't have a 
job.

Intramurals spring into action 



By Ben Solero 
Managing Editor 

Spring semester intramural sports 
action begins Monday. Feb. 1, wiih 
the opening of men's and women's 
basketball and racquctball. The new 
intramural sports season offers six ac- 
tivities for students. 

Basketball draws the highest num- 
ber of panicipants wiih 200-300 stu- 
dents involved, according to Cheryl 
Pasko, director of intramural activi- 
ties at IPFW. 

Other spring intramurals haven't 
faired as well as baskciball in terms 
of total participation: however. Pasko 



is pleased with ihe steady inacase of 
participants in iniramuraJs during the 
last four years. 

"You always have your consistent 
few good supponers of the programs, 
but it's always nice to sec some new 
faces." said Pasko. 

The principal goal of intramural 
sports is having fun and taking pan in 
healthful activity according to Pasko. 
Despite the steady increases in stu- 
dent participation and the iniiiaiion of 
new programs almost every semester. 
Pasko would like lo do more, 

"I am always open for suggestions," 
stated Pasko. "The determiner of die 
program's success is in the number of 



students participating and returning 
year after year." Pasko believes stu- 
dents should take advantage of the 
activities ofTered through intramurals. 
"The students pay for intramurals

Mastodons defeat Bellarmine, 
edge by tough Kentucky State 



My Michael Bass 
Sports Editor 

The 12-2 Mastodons edged by 10-5 
Kcniucky Suic, winning with a score 
of 83-78. 

In a game ihai would go down lo 
ihc last minute, Ihc men's Mastodons 
tumcd away the contending Kentucky 
State. 

TWo days before the Kcniucky State 
victory the Mastodons cleaned up Uic 
floor wiih Bellarminc beating ihcm 
byascorcof i02-75. 

Against Kentucky State, Ihc first 
shot of the game was a tlircc pointer 
hit by Kentucky Stale. In the first half 
Kcniucky Siaic would build up a siz- 
able lead of ten points only to watch 
the Mastodons fight back into the 
game. 

The Mastodons never saw the lead 
in the first half, until senior Scan 
Gibson put in a field goal with :02 
left in the half. His basket gave his 
team a 41-40 lead at the end of the 
haJf. 

Kcniucky Slate hit the first shot of 
the second half for a three pointer to 
lake Ihc lead. The Mastodons would 
tie it quickly and, in a back and forth 
battle, the 1PF\V team would eventu- 
ally come out with the lead and build 
il to a seven point margin at 64- 57. 

With 8: 1 1 left in the game Kentucky 
State roared back to tic it and take the 
lead away from the Mastodons. 

IPFW tied the game again with 4:23 
left by a three pointer from Junior 
Scott Simmons. On the Mastodons 
next possession, with the game tied at 
67-67, senior Andre Walton was 
fouled. Walton came up big hitting 
both free throws giving IPFW a two 
point lead. Senior Pat Murphy hit to 
build the lead to three at 71-68. 

Kentucky State rallied one last time 
to take the lead at 74-73 but Simmons 
sank the three pointer again for the 
Masiodoas. making the score 76-74, 



The Mastodons never relinquished 
the lead again. Kentucky State in foul 
trouble sent Gibson, Walton, and 
Simmons to the free throw line in the 
last two minutes of play. 

The Mastodons' last seven points 
were all scored from the free throw 
line. 

"I just play hard every game," said 
Gibson, "whatever il lakes lo win 
games." 

Gibson led all scorers with 27 
points and led all rebounding with 18. 
Simmons and Walton boih had 14 
points. Simmons hit three of four 
thrce-po inters, and Walton had eight 
assists on the night. 

Kentucky Slate's coach William 
Graham says the key to the IPPiV 



victory over his team was the two big 
Uirccs, hit by Simmons in the last live 
minutes of the game. 

Against Bellarminc. IPFW came out 
strong and never gave Bellarminc the 
lead. 

Walton scored a career high of 21 
points against Bellarmine. shooting S- 
5 in the first half and ending 9-10 for 
the night. 

Gibson led all scorers against Bel- 
larminc with 24 poinu, Gibson also 
had a career high nine assists.

Life performs again 
as 'Charley's Aunf 



Uy Mary True, Copy Editor, and 
Jeanne Kachuk, SUfT Wrller 

Larry L. Life, IPFW aisociaic pro- 
Tcssor of ihcalcr, is Lord Fancourt 
Babbcrlcy. the impersonating star of 
"Charley's Aunt." running through 
Sunday, Jan. 31 at First Prcsbyierian 
Theater. Tickets for the show are S8 
general admission, S6 for seniors, and 
S5 for students. 

"Charley's Auni" is Brandon 
Thotnai' 1892 farce of mistaJten iden- 
tity, focusing on two Osford students 
(David Yamcllc and Stephen Hunt) 
trying to impress their lady friends 
(Krisicn Johnson and Regan Krcigh) 
by arranging a luncheon with 
Charley's aunt from Brazil. 

Wlicn the aunt is delayed in coming. 
Babbcrley enters, disguised as her. It 
is then that the mayhem begins. 



"Actually, I've played this role three 
times before," says Life, director of 
Purdue-Indiana Theater. "I played ii 
in National Company and the musical 
version in National Company, and in 
summer stock." 

Wiien "Charley's Aunt" was first 
produced in London in 1892, it was 
so successful it ran for four years. 
Thomas' script was updated for con- 
temporary audiences in 1934. There 
is a 1941 movie siarring Jack Benny 
and a recent television version with 
Charles Grodin, 

First Presbyterian's production, di- 
rected by Mary Yarnelle, uses the 
original 1892 script, in which the 
physical action is more exaggerated 
th^ modem versions. 

For more information call the First 
Presbyterian Theater Box Office at 
(219)422-6329. 



Focus on... Home Rules 



By Kay Hinga 
Footprints Editor 

1) Always call 911, no matter what 
the emergency is. The police arc paid 
to direct your call to the right person. 

2) Never let your mate drive your 
car — the ga.s tank will be empty 
when returned. This causes delays in 
amvmg at school, and makes students 
popular with their profcssore, 

3) Don't worry about learning how 
to shut off the water in die house in 
case of an emergency, as the water 
department gets paid to run out and 
shut it off. They especially appreciate 
the 2 a.m. wake-up calls. 

4) Never turn the water off when re- 
placing the washer in a faucet. If you 
do, then ilierc is no way to tell if the 
repair will work once the handle is 
off. 

5) If a fuse blows, and there arc no 
more around the house, place a penny 
in the fuse hole. (This lip is courtesy 
of the fire department's list of tips for 
job security,) 

6) If an appliance doesn't work 
right, the first siep is to hit the control 
panel with a harruncr. 

7) If the kitchen sink appear.-. 



clogged, pour more water down the 
drain. Eventually the clog will go 
away. 

8) Store candles above the oven so 
they are easier to find when the lights 
go out. 

9) If out of dishwasher soap, regular 
dishwashing detergent is a nice sub- 
stitute to use in the washer. The extra 
bubbles help ihc dishes to sparkle at 
the end of the cycle. 

10) Inviie tlic friendly neighborhood 
burglar inside the house before shoot- 
ing him. This will help to save on at- 
torney fees, 

11) Call your city council person at 
2 a.m. if 911 is unable to help with 
your problem. It is their job lo solve 
problems ^c police can't. 

12) Fire Depanmeni's #2 job securi- 
ty tip: If you think you smell leaking 
gas, light a match. This will help you 
locale the leaking gas, and the fire de- 
partment gets a big band out of the 
ensuing lire. 

13) Let your newspapers pile up 
when you go on vacation. No one will 
notice, and you will catch up on all 
the local news the day you get back. 




Webster Street 

Notice a December day- 
It swills in the streets around us. 
Tikes real shape in apartments above 
And in the basemenis below us. 

She spent a sleet slick evening 

Writing "No more victims" on a sign 

With a pen that gave off fumes, 

Sending children locked into Iheir rooms. 

Then carried it in a circular way. 

As people auto ambulate 

In dieir sterile incubators. 

Her mission hard as a metal chair. 

Smooth and cold. 

Like some documents, unknown and rare. 

Like vaporous taunts in winter air. 

The winds breathed on the sign above. 

The cars, the day. a point of blur: 

A Decern tier day, 

Swirled in the suect before her, 

took its own shape in apartments above 

and in the alleys beyond her.

Languages endangered 



Of the world's 6,000 languages, lii 
guisis believe 90 perccni are likely to 
vanish by the year 2100. 

"The Impending Language Cata-

World's Languages Are Endangered" 
is the lopic of a free public lecture to- 
day, Jan. 28, from 1-3 p.m. in the 
Classroom Medical Building, Room 
160. 

Miriam H. (Mimi) Klaiman, assis- 
tant professor of linguistics, will ex-

same forces that put pressure on hu- 
man communities: genocide, urban- 
i^tion, and the ma.ss media.

Klaiman earned a Ph.D. in linguis- 
tics from the University of Chicago, 
where she was a National Science
