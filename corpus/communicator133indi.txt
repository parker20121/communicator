Navarro thinks that the station 
needs an annual operating budget of 
about 1100,000 and would ilho a capital

would go toward applying tor a grant 
from Ihe ledcrol govemmoit

Fortunately,

WIPU first broadcasted in June 1W3 
[t originated from a 500-square-lool 
group of offices, a studio, and a record 
library in Ihe basement of Ihe Helmke 
Library With a four-member, full-time 
slaK working BO-lo-lOO hours per week, 
and a devoted group of volunteers, the 
station brought classical and Jan 
music to Ihe Fort Wayne area five- 
hoursD-day. 

At Ihe lime, Gerry Dovis, then WIPN 
program director said, "we're Fort 
Wayne's best kept secret." and called 
Ihe university, "the greatest obstacle in 
the growth of IheElatloa" 

Overcoming whatever the obstacles, 
WIPU grew. By 1979, the station was 
broadcasting 15 hours every week and 
had brought in such progr^ims as "The 
Melropolilan Opera" and "Music From 
Oberhn " A milestone was reached on 
Jon. IT, 1979 when Ihe station Joined 
with Fort Wayne Public Television 
Channel 39 for a slmuilaoeous broad- 
CBSl ot a television program. 

Prom the beginning, there was much 
anticipation that WIPU would become a . 
part of the National Public Radio 
Network. Fort Wayne was one of the 
largest cities in the country not having 
such a station. To get this acceptance. 
WIPU began seeking funds for a larger 
Iransmllter tower, considered a 
"must" for the network in 1979. 

But lowers take money, money which 
the slallon didn't have then, either The 
station's funding In those days came 

CETA work programs, and prii'otc 
contributors. The CETA money, 
however, ran out In September. 1979. 

Tom Jamrose, then slallon manager 
for WIPU, solved that problem. 
Jamrcse got the university to take over 
the CETA funds starling on Oct. 1 of 
thai year. Now on firmer financial 
ground and with a suiruner fimd drive 
which raised S5G0O, the slaUon was able

But these funds wereonly temporary, 
"When presidents Ryan Presidents 
Ryan and Hansen Io( lU and Purdue 
rcspeclivclyi agreed lo a radio station, 
it was with the understanding that no 
general funds would be used." said

"Hansen said that Chancellor Giusll 
could ise up lo H5.000 to get the radio

be repaid by the station. This money 
was never repaid." Camaghi said 

"The radio station account went into 
overdraft slatie. and the presideni 
(Kanseni asked for an account ol the 
overdraft," Camaghi continued. 
All of this happened by February. 

isai. 

Then In March, a meeting of Ihe 
staLon advisory board was held to 
discuss WlPU's financial woes. That 
meeting, according to several l^m- 
municalor sources, was the cause of a 
great deal of hard feelings on the part ot 
certain members of theboard 

Some people at the radio station 
claimed that the administration was 
not dealing with the board or station In 
good fallh and did not keep them In- 
formed as to what was happening 

"Wp had known cuti were comingfor 
a year-and-ahalf, said a source at 
WIPU, "but we didn't know we would 
be cut olf completely. By the lime they 
told us about It. there was nothing we 
could do to raise the money to keep the 
station on campus." 

One station worker claimed thai 
there was never a formal operating 
budgel. and it was never clear how 
much money the station had or woidd 
need in the future. 

"There were ways to raise money, 
but we could never gel them ap- 
proved," the source said, "Proposals 
would go lo the University Relations 
affice but never return." 

Jerry Morgan Medley, director of 
university relations and development, 
disputes this. "Thestation always had a 
very specific budget I can't Imagine 
why anyone would say something like 
that." 

The seeming lack of communication 
between that office and WIPU fueled 
rumors thai it was Hansen who wanted 
out of the radiobusinessin Fort Wayne 
foronyola variety ol personal reasons. 
The gceslp mill picked up steam this 
past summer when an unexpected 
special announcement was played on 
WIPU 

Tied that the

t the

appointed and confirmed as Goi-eriKir 
of Coordinating Sludenl Acbvltjes. 
Sylvester expressed concern atmul Ihe 
lack of activities geared toward 
students over 21 years of age and the 
lack ol weekday activities which would 
be more accessible tor students com- 
muting long distances. She cited the 
tact that the median age tor students 
for this campus Is 26.7 years, con- 
siderably higher than most resident 
campuses 

In her new position. Sylvester said 
she hopes lo tie able bj plan more ac- 
tivities for the students with families, 
such as a picnic where children would 
tw welcome.

The first dance ot the semester was 
Aug. 28 "Gel Acquainted Dance" in the 
North Room of the Memorial Coliieum. 



This event was more than the firal 
dance of the school; it was the debut of 
Ihe 15.000 stereo system purchased Ihls 
summer by SUBOG 

This spring, as classes were winding 
down and SUBOG was checking Its 
budgets, an excess of tio.OOO was still 
on the books It is campus policy that 
any area's unspent funds, as of May 30, 
are aulomallcally channeled into a 
general fund and are no longer the 
property ol the original group. In an 
effort lo make the most of SUBOG'i 
funds, a stereo was purchased along 
with other equipment for the univer' 
sity, mctuding a mlcroGtmlng machine 
for the library 

Terry Schuster, SUBOG co- 
chairperson, commented on the "ex- 
ceilenl movie series put together for 
Ibis semester" which opened last 
Saturday with "Fatne" and will coo- 
linue on Sept. 12 with Ttx Pink 
Panther Strikes AgaitL" 

While movies, dances, coocerti, 
lectures and a hayride are planned for 
later in the semester, only halt of the 
money allocated for the fall semester 
has been spenL 

Currcndy, there u a six-week span 
with no actlvites planned, but a fnr 
movies, from the end of September to 
the middle of October. SUBOG hopes to 
have this problem cofrecled shortly.

Planning lack 
dooms WIPU 



WIPU-FM. Ihe (in-campus public radio 
stalion licensed lo Purdue Univereily. is 
much in Ihe news; and Ihe news isn't 
good for those who have wanted the 
slation to remain here. 

Three jjroblems — lack ol com- 
munication, minimal univcrslly support 
and laeh of pre-planning — seem to be 
behind Ihe Hiatlon's (roubles. 

The lack of communtcaltnn between 
Purdue's adminislrallun and ihc station 
management Is mnsi evident when one 
considers Ihat station personnel did not 
know unlit recently WIPU *as expected 
to repay the 115,000 provided by Purdue 
to finance the start or the station in I97S. 
According lo .John Carnaghi. vice- 
chancellor for financial affairs. Purdue 
iPresident Arthur Hansen become 
"-concerned when IhcSl.^.OOO showed up as 
an overdraft on WIPU's account. 
;iPrcsidonl Hansen then informed IPFW 
■il could no longer operate WIPU using 
university funds 

Minimal university support, 
especially In the areu of financing of the 
station, was pointed out as Far back as 
January, 1979. when in a ncM-s article in 
The Communicator. Gerry Davis, then 
' the WIPU program director, was quoted 
as saying, "The university is the 
greatest obstacle in the growth of the 
station" 

IPPW Chancellor Joseph P. Giusll and 
Jerry Medley, director ol university 
relations and development, seemed to 
realize the importance of the station to 
the growing image of IPFW, bul even 



their concern for the station did not 
bring about much ofHcial university 
support. Again, the lack of support by 
Ihe university was where WIPU needed 
Ihe most backing — with funds 

Bul, even had there been com- 
municaljon and support, the third 
problem — lack of pre-planning — would 
have left WIPU about where it is today. 

Throughout its three-year operation 
here. WIPU existed 'hand-Io-mouth' 
financially. Although fund-raising drives 
were planned and executed, they were 
done BO with Ihe Intent of raising monies 
for day-to-day operations and purchases 
of needed equipment, liltle long-range 
planning is evident. 

Throughout the station's history, plans 
were made for what lo do with monies 
raised, but no one seemed lo come up 
with Ideas for raising the money needed 
to assure Ihe continuance of the station 
wilhout monetary assistance from the 

This lack of pre-planning was Ihe true 
culprit that brought about IPFW's 
complete loss of Its radio station. 

While it's sad that IPFW will lose its 
one direct line lo the people of Fort 
Wayne — via the campus-originated 
broadcasts of WIPU, it's hoped the 
lessons learned from the experience of 
losing the station are well learned by 
those who in the future would embark on 
. similar projects ... 

We'll miss you. WIPU. and we hope 
your off-campus, non-university af- 
filiations are successful.

By the Renaissance, 
work skills had 
specialLied and the 
"craftsman" had come 
into being. Craftsmen 
became highly skilled 
workers who underwent 
extended apprenticeshifo 
to earn the tiile of jour- 
nsymen Significantly, 
diis class was also known 
as 'freemen." 

Then came the 
Industrial Revolulion. 
With Ihe advent of the 
factory, a reienUcss 
process of de-s kilting 
began. Skilled craftsmen 
were a problem for 
factory owners because 
they could force higher 
wages simply by

Unhappily, the decline 
in the percentage of blue-

accompanied by an even 
more rapid decline in the 
prestige sociely assigns 
lo the work they do. I 
speak feelingly about ttus 
issue, for I spent many 
years working in a blue

In each of these jobs I 
worked hard physically, 
and 1 was conlinualiy 
aware of the fact thai 

needed by sociely. Yet, I 
never felt my work was 
appreciated, even when I 
was installing toilet bowls 
and balhtubs — two 
" absolute necessities of 
modem life' 

A GLANCE INTO 
HISTORY 



by that same society? ^ 
glance into history 
might help us to un- 
de rsiand this anomaly 

Starting In the (kilden 
Age oi Classical Greece, 
when staves did all 
necessary tabor, people 

come lo be looked down 

feudalism developed 
further norlh in Europe, it 
was Ihe peasant — the 

hierarchy — who did the 
planting, harvesting, and 
other work for the manor 
on which he laliored as 



argued that greater ef- 
ficiency would be 
achieved if work tasks 
were engineered into 
their smallest possible 
components, relieving 
individual workers of 
decision making. 

Taylor's philosophy, 
adopted by Henry Ford 
and other Indus UluUsts, 
aimed lo dedicate every 
minute of a worker's time 
to production. In the 
process, workers came to 
be treated as things — 

machines — and the craft 
went out of crafts-

made mass production 
possible and heralded the

MASS PRODUCTION 

Underlying Ihe concept 
of mass production was 
the innovation ol In- 
terchangeable parts. For 
example, a part made for 
one clock was manu- 
factured so it would fit in 



terchangeable. Without 
Ihe need For special sklUs, 
any worker could per- 
form any part ol Ihe 
assembly process with 
only a short training 



ongoing. Forcxample.we 
are currently wiuiessmg

of newspaper printing.

But society liolds even

are frustrated because

freedom to pace their

collar workers make or 
install things, their work 
is easily quantified; most 
white-collar workers are 
not subjecled lo such 
measurement of output. 
Blue-collar workers 
also face daily the task oF 
making Iheir repetitive 
work bearable. In order 
to cope with routine Jobs

This feeling of a

unequal distribuuon of

a result, young people 
tend lo reject manual 
work, preferring the

Even as the economy

'Werewolf blends gore, humor 



ByMIKECEFFEN 

LonChaneyJr is probably 
turning over in his grave, 
Wriler-direclor John Landis' 
new Jilm. "An American 
Werewolf In London," 
wreaks hilarious ha^'oc on 
the werewolf legend. 

The film could be 
described as a hip version of 
"I Was A Teenage 
Werewolf," but don't let that 
fool you The film is made 
with panache, and its lone 
sets it apart from other 
horror fdms, straight or 
otherwise, 

in a deft blend of satire 
and gore, Landis makes the 
Tilm both terrilying and 
funny He pays homage to 
the old Universal horror 
films by playing straight the 
scenes ivith the villagers. 



burlesques them by subtly 
SBllrizIng the (act that an 

werewolf. Landis has at last 
developed a style, and 
"Werewoir* has the clanty 
and wit that were lacking In 
his last two films, "Animal 
House" and "The Blues 
Brother* " 

To tell loo much of the plot 
would spoil the movie, but 
suirice It to say thai an 
American backpacking 
through England with a 
friend gets bitten by a 
werewoll. From there on In, 
Landis has a good time with 
this premise. 

The performances in this 
film ere not that important, 
since it Is the director's style 
that makes the film work, 
but David Naughton, as 
David Kessler. the boy who 
gets bitten, is good. He 



shows a nice flair tor timing 
and deadpans some hilarious 
Imcs. Jenny Agutter, as 
Alex, the love Interest, has 
nothing much to do but look 
good, but she does manage 
to hai-e convincing ropporl 
with Na ugh ton 

Part of the fun of this fUm 
comes from Ihe way Landis 
combines reality and llliElon 
in ihe first pari of the [Um. 
He plays around with our 
notions of suspense and our 
expectations of horror fUma. 
The resulting scenes are 
among the most bizarre ever 
pul In a horror film 

These scenes are 
enhanced by Rick Baker's 
fantastic make-up. The
