Quote of the week 



"The homeless today are people who never thought 
they'd be in this position. Many factory workers 
thought they were set for life, but now they don't have 
the skills required for today's jobs."

How to start 
your law career 
before you start 

law school. 



Start with the Kaplan LSAT prep course. 

After taking Kaplan, thousands of LSAT 
students score over 40. That's the top 10% 
nationwide! And candidates who score 
over 40 on the new LSAT enjoy the best 
chance of being accepted to the law school 
of their choice and going on to practice 
with top law firms or corporations. 

So call any of our 120 centers for 
information and class starting dates. The 
Kaplan LSAT prep course could be the 
one pre-law course that determines the 
course of your law career.
