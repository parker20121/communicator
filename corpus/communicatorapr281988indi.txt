Minority coverage 



Noted journalist offers advice 



By KEN COVEY 
Staff Writer 
William Raspberry, a nationally 
.syndicated columnist for The 
Washington Post, was the featured 
speaker at (he Minorities and Women 
in the Media awards banquet held last 
Friday in Walb Memorial Union. 

The event, which was sponsored by 
the IPFW Office of Minority Affairs 
Development and the Fort Wayne 
Urban League, Inc., recognized 
outstanding print, television and radio 
coverage of issues related to women 
and minorities. 

Raspberry, who has received honors 
for journalistic coverage of minority 
issues, gave a speech in which he 
discussed minority involvement in 
journalism. 

Raspberry began his journalism 
career as a reporter for The 
Indianapolis Reporter. "My four years 
there served as my journalism 
school," Raspberry said, "It gave me 
a chance to discover I really did like 
the business. I went there because I 
needed work; I stayed because I 
learned to love it." 

At the time, said Raspberry. 
minorities were not prominent in the 
media and were especially scarce in 
broadcasting. "I didn't even think 
about the electronic media in those 
days." said flaspberry. "There wasn't 
a black person on television in all of 
Indiana at the time, and the handful of 
blacks who were on radio were disc 
jockeys who were spinning requests 
for black listeners." 

Raspberry offered advice to 
students just beginning to plan 
careers. "There are a couple of 
lessons for journalists and non- 



journalists, too," said Raspberry. 
"The first is that you have to be 
ready. The second is that you have to 
be necessary. The third is that you 
have to be lucky. If you get the first 
two right, you'll be amazed at how 
lucky you get at times," 

Raspberry told students that train- 
ing in school or on the job will be 
important for them later in life, "The 
trick is to learn as much as you can 
about as many things as you can," 
said Raspberry, "and stay loose 
enough to recognize opportunity when 
it tries to sneak by you." 

Rasptterry said another factor was 
equally important for young people 
"Learn to make yourself necessary," 
Raspl&gt;erry said. "What you can do is 
persuade an employer that you are 
bright and eager and worth having 
around," 

As an example. Raspberry cited his 
involvement with civil rights coverage 
for The Washington Post in the 1960's. 
Raspberry said he worked to gather 
information on the civil rights 
movement, including getting the home 
phone numbers of persons involved 
and attending meetings on his days 
off. "After a matter of just a few 
weeks, the editor in charge of this 
coverage was calling me over to find 
out what was going on," said 
Raspberry. "I had made myself a 
beat. I had made myself necessary." 

Raspberry encouraged students not 
to worry if they find themselves in 
career fields different from what they 
had planned and added that the 
constantly changing technology in the 
job market might make long-term 
planning difficult. 



"When I tell you to get ready, I 
mean that you should gel ready for 
opportunity; get ready for change. 



because it's coming. And the question 
is whether you can embrace it as a 
friend or meet it like an enemy."

Former administrator 
fatally struck by car 



Reorganization, issues 
discussed at convocation

0. Franklin Kenworlhy. former 
assistant vice chancellor and dean of 
academic services, died after being 
struck by a car Saturday in 
Springfield, MO. 



The annual Faculty Convocation 
was held on Friday, April 22. The 
purpose of the meeting was to discuss 
the positive developments of the past 
year, future plans for the imiversity 
and budget issues. 

Chancellor Thomas Wallace began 
the meeting by slating that he has 
been pleased with the progress of 
IPFW this year. He also remarked on 
the tremendous efforts of many people 
to accomplish this progress, 

Wallace said that he was pleased 
with the reorganization progress 
within the individual schools and 
divisions since they have begun work- 
ing on their own internal structures 
and procedures. He emphasized where 
the university stands in regards to the 
new computer science and master of 
business administration programs. 
The first person to complete the MBA 
program will graduate in May. 

The Chancellor said enrollment has 
increased this year because of in- 
creased advertising and a change in 
the registration system. This has 
created a friendlier environment for 
new students, Wallace said, Wallace 
also paid tribute to the graduating 
student council, citing their willing- 
ness to change and the campuswide 
celebration that has been planned. 

Looking toward the future, Wallace 
said he would be making changes in 
the smoking policy within the next two 
weeks, using the smoking committee's 
findings as a guide. He said that the 
groundbreaking for the new Fine Arts 
Building would be this fall, and plans 
are being submitted to West Lafayette 
for a proposed Engineering, Science 
and Technology Building. 

Moving on to budget issues, Wallace 
said that priorities had been set to 
help in problem areas such as 
enrollment, the nature and quality of 
the undergraduate experience and 
new graduate programs. 

Among the budget issues discussed 
was the capability of getting external 
funding, Wallace stressed that more 
emphasis must be put on obtaining 



funding from outside sources, 
including alumni and local 
corporations. 

Another budget issue regarded the 
difficulty in recruiting new faculty. 
One faculty member expressed 
concern that starting salaries were not 
competitive and Ihat space for offices 
or research was limited. Wallace 
agreed, stating that the university 
would have lo consider spending 
money lo convert classrooms into 
offices and labs while examining the 
starting salaries offered by each de- 
partment and school to make them 
more competitive,

Campus housing, directory 
suggested at Helmke lecture 



Several excellent suggestions 
were made during Mayor Paul 
Helmke's "The City and the Uni- 
versity" lecture last week. 

Contrasting IPFW with lU- 
Bloomington, a university active in 
political and social functions, 
Helmke said IPFW needs to be 
stronger, bigger and possibly resi- 
dential. The last aspect of this 
suggestion, university housing, has 
remained an unrealized proposal in 
the many years it has been form- 
ally and informally discussed. 

IPFW seems closer to gaining 
dormitories than ever before. The 
Office of Admissions recently con- 
ducted a survey of students' at- 
titudes about campus housing. 
Students were mailecf a short ques- 
tionnaire requesting such informa- 
tion as the number of miles com- 
muted to and from IPFW per week, 
how likely the student would be to 
request to live in university housing 
and what effect living in university 
housing might have on individual 
participation in social organiza- 
tions, campus events or athletics. 
Incorporating students" opinions on 
university growth with the admin- 
istration's decision-making in such 
instances is just as important a re- 
lationship as any that could develop 
between Fort Wayne and IPFW. 

An audience member from the 
department of sociology made a 



pertinent proposal for increased 
city-university interdependence. 
She said that a directory of IPFW 
faculty specialists should be made 
available to Helmke for purposes of 
consultation and local studies. Such 
a pool of intelligence and resources 
should eliminate the need for out- 
side research firms, which can be 
quite costly. 

Hopefully Helmke will give some 
serious thought to this suggestion. 
Although critics may contend 
IPFW faculty are too closely in- 
volved in the surrounding commu- 
nity to be objective in local con- 
cerns, such professionals are ca- 
pable enough not to let personal 
biases cloud their judgments. Be- 
sides, who knows a community 
better than the people who live 
there? 

Campus housing at IPFW can 
encourage the type of atmosphere 
found at traditional college cam- 
puses. With several large colleges 
in southern Ind. closing their doors 
to freshmen this fall, increased en- 
rollment at IPFW may make dor- 
mitories even more practical. 
Complementing this proposal with 
a campus task force to be at 
Helmke's service would transform 
IPFW into, in Helmke's words, "a 
resource benefiting the entire 
region." 



Trust and optimism 

A lesson to be learned? 



By RICHARD JOHNSON 
Features Editor 

I lock my doors. My car doors, 
the doors on my home, I lock them 
all. Why? I am not sure. I've never 
been robbed. I've never had any- 
thing taken nut of my car or house. 
I guess I jusl don't trust people. Or 
maybe it's because I've been 
taught not to trust people. 

Commentary 

I'm really — deep down in- 
side—very trusting I leave my 
book bag lying around campus, and 
I've never had anything stolen 
from it. That enhances my feelings 
of trust. My brother had a portable 
mega-stereo stolen from nis car 
whilst it was sitting on campus. I 
have friends who have had their 
bags stolen right outside of Fol- 
lett's and their books sold back for 
cash. This weakens my trust. 

I was raised not to trust anyone 
when it came to my personal be- 
longings. This distrust manifested 
itself m my embarrassment from 
having to use a Dr. Pepper beach 
blanket with "Rick Johnson" in 6- 
inch-high letters magic-markered 

Recycle or retain? 



across the bottom by parents who 
didn't trust the other 10-year-olds 
at a church camp. I did. I still trust 
10-year-olds. I still trust anyone 
who hasn't proven that I should feel 
otherwise. 

I suppose one of these days I'll 
learn a bis lesson in trusting. One 
of these days I may come back 
from a computer terminal and find 
by book bag devoid of any class- 
room text. Maybe I won't. 

My brother's experience with 
thieves and students' experiences 
with lost books should allow me to 
learn vicariously the "lesson" of 
trusting. 

Then, by the same token, I should 
learn the "lesson" of being op- 
timistic by the stories of others 
having their hopes crushed. I re- 
fuse to learn that lesson. I shall 
continue to be optimistic as well as 
trusting. 1 will continue in my old- 
fashioned Midwestern idealism. 
And 1 will be happy. 

I will secure enjoyment from 
trusting that no one will pillage my 
goods if I leave the sunroof on my 
car open, and I will revel in the 
optimism that it won't rain while 
I'm gone. 



Uses for old textbooks 



By JOHN AUGUSTYNIAK 
Copy Editor 

Soon after my last final exam is 
completed, I will descend upon the 
campus bookstore, along with a 
flock of other students, to sell back 
the same textbooks I purchased a 
mere four months earlier. And in- 
evitably I will rediscover just how 
much textbooks can depreciate in 
one semester. 

Commentary 

I've received as little as 10 per- 
cent of the original purchase price 
for texts that were overstockea and 
as much as 50 percent for others; 
book selling can be a second "in- 
come tax refund" for some. No 
matter how badly cheated one may 
feel, at least this semester's objects 
of discontent are gone. And next 
semester the cycle will be 
repeated. 

Some students try to sell their 
used books using advertisements on 
bulletin boards around campus to 
tout their merchandise. Others 
simply trade textbooks with other 
student acquaintances. Either way, 
the students are rid of superfluous 
material. 

A small majority of students may 
actually wish to retain possession 
of every textbook they nave ever 

C chased. These are not just the 
ks that have become outdated in 
the semester they were used by 
students; such texts have "no 
value" and are usually, appropri- 
ately, placed in the circular file. 
Students who cannot bear to part 
with their schoolbooks because they 
can't stand to take a loss on the 
purchase price or because they feel 



the texts may be of reference value 
in the future worry me. 

These students have not yet 
learned the American business 
principle of "cutting one's losses." 
Is anyone really punishing the 
bookstore by withholding booKS for 
resale? Perhaps, but that person is 
also depriving another student 
from purchasing a used text at a 
reduced price. 

People who build a personal li- 
brary comprised of school text- 
books also tend to he the mcKt 
critical of others. These are the 
people who try to psychologically 
analyze a person based on infor- 
mation learned in their in- 
troductory psychology classes. 
Their "reference copy" textbooks 
become the basis for their superior 
expertise in a cornucopia of subject 
areas. 

Humor aside, many students may 
find saving textbooks from the area 
in which they are majoring to be 
invaluable sources in their future 
careers. And having shelves full of 
books in one's office does seem to 
lend prestige to one's occupation; 
visit a professor in his office and 
you'll see what I mean. Whether or 
not they are ever opened is another 
question. I would expect that cer- 
tain people, medical personnel, for 
example, would already know 
everything in the texts. 

So textbooks might have some 
value other than recycling. Very 
soon every student will again face 
the dilemma of choosing what to do 
with used textbooks. Deciding 
whether to keep or dispose of these 
textbooks depends on whether you 
want cash, a reaffirmation of your 
superiority or a bookshelf 
decoration. 




-Letters to the Editor- 



Ashton leaves 

An open letter to the stu- 
dents at IPPW: 

Does it make sense to 
remove an excellent ed- 
ucator from our university? 
Is it fair lo strip away one 
or our most talented and 
dedicated professors? Dr. 
Patrick J. Ashton will be 
leaving us after the Tirst 
summer session. He's not 
leaving because he wanted 
a job that paid him more. 
He's leaving l&gt;ecause he's 
being forced to: 

' ■ There is no 
question about Dr. 
Ashton 's ability to 
teach. Ask any stu- 
dent who has ever 
been in one of his 
c/asses- Have any of 
the higher ranking 
administrators sal in 
on one of his 
classes?" 

Dr. Ashton didn't kill 
anyone, nor did he steal. 
His mistake was the fact 
that he wanted to be a real 
teacher. 1 pay $50.25 per 
credit hour here, and I 
think that 1 deserve a truly 
good professor. In the past 
couple of months I have 
discovered that there is an 
"unspoken" rule at IPFW, 
When a professor is up for 
tenure, administrators think 
that their work in research 
is more important than 
teaching That makes me 
angry. It is no wonder that 
we have many educators 
employed here because of 
their research, not their 
teaching Somewhere along 
the line priorities have been 
messed up. 

If you already don't know 
what is going on, let me 
explain. In the fall of 1386, 
Dr Ashton of the sociology 
department submitted a 
request for tenure and 
promotion He was un- 
animously recommended by 
his peers and by the Arts 
and Letters Department for 
tenure. These are people 
who work with him 
everyday. 

In Decemtier of 1986 the 
committee, which is hand- 
picked by the chancellor, 
voted 6-1 to deny tenure. 
This negative recommenda- 
tion is without precedent at 
this university. Therefore, 
Vice Chancellor Nicholson 
and Chancellor Wallace 



recommended to the Presi- 
dent of lU that Dr. Ashton 
not be given tenure at 
IPFW. 

For the past year. Dr. 
Ashton has been trying to 
prove his case. His research 
was submitted for review to 
seven social scientists with 
reputations in his areas of 
expertise All the reviews 
were uniformly positive. 
Dr. Ashton submitted his 
findings to the chancellor. 
Chancellor Wallace pro- 
posed another submittal but 
this time the reviewers 
were guaranteed an- 
onymity. When they were 
returned, they reflected the 
same kinds of positive uni- 
formity. Still, this was not 
enough lo change the 
chancellor's mind. 

Recently, Dr Ashton ap- 
pealed the chancellor's 
decision lo the Indiana 
University Fort Wayne 
Faculty Board of Review. 
They agreed that he was 
not given due process. For 
your information, Chancel- 
lor Wallace stated that 
since Dr. Ashlon was not 
recommended for promo- 
tion by higher level campus 
review committees, he 
didn't deserve tenure. 

Stated last week in The 
Communicator, tenure is 
excellence in one or pos- 
sibly two areas: teaching, 
research or service. There 
is no question about Dr, 
Ashton's abilities lo teach. 
Ask any student who has 
ever been in one of his 
classes. Have any of these 
higher ranking adminis- 
trators sat in on one of his 
classes? As far as his re- 
search is concerned, he has 
proved his competence and 
expertise according to oth- 
ers In his field, 

IPFW is here for our ed- 
ucational purposes. Let's 
not let this political system 
take away Dr. Ashlon, 
Currently students are 
writing letters to the presi- 
dent at Indiana University. 
If we can pull together in 
time, we might be able to 
keep Dr. Ashton.

Book defective 

To Uie Editor: 

On Monday, April 18, I 
found my Spanish lextbook 
had a section of pages 
missing. The pages had not 
been bound into this book, 
and it was the fault of the 



publisher. I did not blame 
FoUelfs Bookstore for Uiis 
fault. I did not even blame 
them for the fact that it was 
a recycled copy; someone 
had purchased the book and 
did not tell them atxiut the 
error. When 1 informed 
FoLett's about my problem, 
they ordered me a copy 
from their Chicago ware- 
house. Three days later, af- 
ter we had passed the 
needed pages in class, I 
went lo pick up this new 
copy. Like my old copy, it 
was recycled, Follett's then 
insisted that I return my 
defective, recycled copy to 
them before I could have 
the new recycled copy, 

I don't know how many 
students write in their 
books, but I do. 



"We have all 
known for years that 
they buy our books 
back at a ridiculously 
low price and resell 
at a large markup. 
Why do we have to 
put up with this?" 

All my notes were in the 
margins of the defective 
book. When I refused to 
turn in my old copy, they 
told me I could not take the 
ordered copy unless I paid 
for it, I offered to give them 
both IxKiks back at the end 
of the semester and just cut 
my losses on them if they 
would only let me keep my 
notes, I did not have the 
extra money for this book, I 
felt it was bad enough hav- 
ing to buy this one at a 
greater price than the last 
person, without having to 
pay for this twice. There 
are only two weeks of 
school left, and they would 
have my address and could 
find me easily. They just 
didn't care. This cannot be 
the only company thai ca- 
ters lo campus bookstores. 

This is also just not one 
complaint against this 
company. We have all 
known for years that they 
buy our books back at a ri- 
diculously low price and 
resell at a large markup.

Dollars wasted 

To the Editor: 

In the A'pril 2) etlition-trf- 
The Communicator, you ran 
an editorial titled "Student 
Dollars Wasted." In this 
editorial John Camaghi, the 
Vice-Chanceltor of Finan- 
cial Affairs, allegedly 
stated thai "he had the ap- 
proval of former Dean of 
Students John Ulmer" to 
change the original athletic 
equipment ordered to the 
equipment we have now. 

We somewhat doubt 
whether or not Mr. 
Camaghi really said this, or 
if he did. what context it 
was said in. Unfortunately, 
we will never know, be- 
cause The Communicator 
did not run a news story to 
accompany the editorial. 

Regardless of this error, 
you do have a valid point; 
student dollars were 
wasted. 

In order to develop a 
correct picture of what 
happened, the reader must 
know the history of the 
issue. In IVtay of 1987, we 
came into the office and 
met with the former dean to 
discuss this issue. He con- 
vinced us the Super Circuit 
Aerobic equipment would 
benefit all IPFW students. 
This equipment gave the 
student a complete workout 
in about an hour and was 
completely computerized. 
We asked the senate to al- 
locate (30,100 over two 
years to buy this equip- 
ment. We then worked out a 
deal with the Athletic Cen- 
ter. We would buy half and 
Ihey would buy half. 

In June of that year John 
Ulmer, the former Dean of 
Students, was asked to re- 
sign. In August we returned 
to school, and to our sur- 
prise different equipment 
had been purchasol. After 
we checked our account, we 
discovered that only about 
f 18,000 was used to buy new 
equipment and that the rest 
of your money t&gt;ou^t new 
flooring, mirrors and other 
miscellaneous items. To 
make matters worse, the 
Athletic Center reneged on 
their part of the deal and 
did not pay one cent. 

We then set out to right 
this misallocatlon and 
asked for the complete re- 
turn of all your money. At 
Tu^t, we were told that our 
allocation was not specific 
and that our money would 
not be returned. What the 
administration did not know 
was Ihat we had a copy of 
the original proposal (they 
said they lost theirs) where 
everything was spelled out 



very specifically. Armed 
with this and advice from a 
lawyer, we went back to the 
administration and they 
said they would return the 
money if a senate resolution 
were passed asking for it 
back. 

Unfortunately, when the 
senate considered this reso- 
lution president-elect Tim 
Smith was not in favor of it, 
and it was so watered down 
that it was ineffective. What 
Tim did not consider was 
Uie effect the return of this 
money would have^oiT'tEe 
new budget. Everything 
would have been funded 
adequately, if not in- 
creased. As it stands now, 
almost everything is being 
cut. This means that there 
might not t&gt;e a newspaper 
next year or any activities 
or money for students to 
atlend conferences. 

Regardless of the resolu- 
tion. Mr. Carnaghi should 
admit he was wrong to buy 
the equipment and return 
the students' money. I 
really do not think that 
Dean Ulmer would have 
given permission lo buy 
equipment, ^ven the rela- 
tionship with the other ad- 
ministrators at the end of 
the year and over the 
summer. Even if he did. the 
vice^hancellor knows that 
only the student senate can 
allocate money from stu- 
dent activity fees. He 
should have checked with 
the senate. 

"What Tim did 
not consider was the 
effect the return of 
this money would 
have on the new 
budget. Everything 
would have been 
funded adequately, if 
not increased. As it 
stands now, almost 
everything is being 
cut. " 

Through this whole mess, 
every administrator has 
tried to pass the blame on. 
If the vice-chancellor actu- 
ally made the remark about 
the former dean, il shows 
that he was once again 
passing the blame onto 
someone else. It also shows 
that he was letting an ad- 
ministrator spend the stu- 
dents' money. As the vice- 
chancellor for financial af- 
fairs, he is supposed to 
make sure these kinds of 
things do not happen. If he 
did not make the remark, 
then be is still at fault be- 
cause he let someone else 
spend the money. 

He and all the adminis- 
trators should start taking 
responsibility for their ac- 
tions and slop scapegoating, 
especially when the scape- 
goat is not here to defend 
himself.

Awards presented to artists 



By CAROL CARNALL 

SUrr Writer 

The IPFW Student Art 
Exhibit, located at 1026 W. 
Berry St., is different this 
year. 

"It is a juried show for 
the first time," said Kathy 
Hettinga, exhibitions coor- 
dinator for the department 
of fine arts. "In response to 
that, the Fine Arts Ceramic 
Club, which earns money 
from a yearly ceramic sale, 
donated $400 to t&gt;e used for 
monetary awards." 

The student show, which 
runs through April 29. is an 
opportunity for sophomores 
and juniors to display their 
work, said Hettinga. 
Freshmen students had a 
Foundation Show in March; 
Seniors are currently par- 
ticipating in the Bachelor of 
Fine Arts Exhibit, which is 
being held on the Landing 
at 122 W. Columbia St. 

Four blue-ribbon awards 
were given in the student 
show. Two of the awards 
went to two-dimensional 
entries. Nancy Gangwer 
submitted a lithograph ti- 



tled "Cat Nap." and Susan 
Hurd entered an untitled 
abstract oil on canvas em- 
phasizing color and shape. 

The other two awards 
went to three-Klimensional 
entries. Shirley Hoeppner 
won with a figure in stone 
titled "Figure," and Jean 
Barile won with an en- 
graved stoneware clay 
piece titled "Covered Pot," 

Five honorable mentions 
were named. Joan 
Strehler's untitled stone- 
ware, Patricia Johannsen's 
silver and onyx necklace 
and earrings, Jauneth 
Skinner's untitled oil on 
canvas, Susan Kurd's un- 
titled plaster and Lucinda 
Hawker's "Windy Night" 
collagraph, a relatively new 
print process dating from 
the 1960s, all received hon- 
orable mentions. 

Other kinds of art in the 
- show include watercolors, 
drawings and computer 
graphics. Prints included 
lithographs, intaglios, col- 
lagraphs and relief prints 
from wood cuts and lin- 
oleum blocks.
