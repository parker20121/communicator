Indianii high school studeiils 
may have siumhled upon the 
"lU, PU. or IPFW?" conun- 
drum during their senior 
years of high school. Some 
siudcnls who excel in aca- 
demic or athletes simply go 
where the scholarships arc. 
However, the rest of us musi 
worry about other aspects of 
higher education. 

Of the three coulend- 
Cfs TPFW proved to be (he 
most affordable university. 
According to the College 
Board. 1PF\V had the lowest 
in-state tuition at roughly 
$6,300 per year for a full- 
time student. Purdue Uni- 
versity-West Lafayette came 
in second place at about 
57,750 per year, and Indi- 
ana University -Blooming- 



ton was a close third pluo 
with a price lag of approxi- 
mately $7,800. Education 
among the three universities 
does not differentiate sig- 
nillcanlly, though Purdue is 
iraditionaUy esteemed for 
its mathematical and sci- 
ence departments while In- 
diana is reverb for liberal 
arts. Most degrees, though 
not all, iTom both Indiana 
and Purdue can be attained 
at IPFW. 

Tfae size of the campus is 
also a variable in the college 
decision-making process. A 
school with a smaller num- 
ber of students is typically 
stronger in catering to a -siu- 
dcni's individual needs and a 
student is less likely to have 
a class taught by a teacher's 
assistant. However, a school 
with a larger population al- 
lows students to potentially 



meet more people and expe- 
rience more diversity. There 
are approximately 1 2.000 
students at IPFW, while In- 
diana and Purdue each have 
nearly 40,000 studenB. 

International students are 
also drawn to the IPFW 
campus and its small size 
that promotes individual at- 
tention. Over 50 countries 
arc represented at IPFW. 
which creates a more cultur- 
ally diverse campus and an 
opportunity to learn invalu- 
able lessons. 

"The students arc able 
to learn from each other," 
Connell P. Nelson, Direc- 
tor of International Student 
Services said. "Learning is 
able to go on outside of the 
el; 



college student. An IPFW 
student can save a consid- 
erable amount of money by 
living at home if it is within 
a reasonable distance from 
campus. 

If not, they can live in 
IPFW Student Housing, 
which are less expensive 
than room and board at 
bath Indiana and Purdue. 
IPFW Student Housing just 
completed two additional 
apartment buildings and 
have modem accommoda- 
tions, however, the student 
is responsible for their own 
meals and transportation. 

IPFW room and board 
costs an average of S4.200 
per year. Indiana's room 
and board can cost a student

between S6.100 and S7.800 
per yeai and room and board 
at Purdue will cost a student 
approximately S7.900. In 
addition to being the most 
affordable university, IPFW 
is also located in the most 
affordable ciiy of the three 
schools. 

Students of Indiana and 
Purdue can perhaps accli- 
mate themselves to the real 
world earlier than a student 
attending a local university. 
However. IPFW students 
can prepare themselves to 
enter the real world with 
signiRcantly less debt. 

A price cannot be put on an 
individual's personal prefer- 
ence, sense of adventure, or 
desire to leave the nest and 
theircomforlzone. StudenLs 
are oftentimes drawn to Pur- 
due and Indiana because 
they are situated in quintes- 
sential college towns. Liv- 
ing in such an atmosphere 
is what some believe to be 
a once in a lifetime opportu- 
nity as well as a rile of pas- 
sage. 

"Many [students] want to 
get away from home and out 
on theirown," Laura Zeigler, 
Assistant Director of Admis- 
sions said. 'They don't want 
to feci as if they're going 
into (he ihirtecnih grade." 



IPFW can also offer stu- 
dents the element of adven- 
lure with the Student Ex- 
change Program, in which 
students are able lo transfer 
to a participating college 
or university in the United 
States for a term or even a 
year. This allows students 
to become involved in pro- 
grams and classes that are 
not available at IPFW. study 
with an esteemed profes- 
sor, or just to experience a 
change in scenery. 

There will always be an 
opportunity to grow, be 
independent, and take on 
more responsibilities as 
one enters new chapters in 
life. While some arc eager 
to embark to the traditional 
college atmosphere in a tra- 
ditional college town with 
the traditional college party 
scene and football games. 
IPFW can offer students the 
opportunity to grow with 
significant knowledge and 
experience at a fraction of 
the cost of attending Indiana 
or Purdue. 
The next time the words 
'I paid for what?' are men- 
tioned, stop and think about 
all the money you saved. 



Rock the vote at IPFW 



By ELAINE BAKLE 

taUetOloipfw.c-iu 



On the IPFW campus, there 
are many students extremely 
interested in the next elec- 
tion. There will be many 
active discussions from now 
until the general election in 
2008 and also area political 
activity that ultimately will 
reHeci the changes desired 
by the up and coming gener- 
ation. But, if the voter turn 
out at the next election re- 
flects that of the past, these 
changes may not take place. 
The City of Fort Wayne 
is currently experiencing a 
political debacle of major 
proportion that threatens to 
interrupt the upcoming may- 
oral elections. Matt Kelty. 
the Republican candidate 
for mayor, has been indicted 
for nine counts of campaign 
fraud. Opinions, referenced 
on blogs and other area 
publications regarding this 
indictment by area citizens 
range from the pragmatic 
to the unabashedly loyal. 






d that si 



Kelly ii aspiring to become 



Fort Wayne's next mayor, do 
the citizens of Fori Wayne 
want someone so inexperi- 
enced that he did not under- 
stand the consequences of 
his actions? Others believe 
it to be a shame that only the 
independently wealthy can 
afford to nin for office. 

Now is the chance for the 
block of voters from 18 to 
24 to weigh in and voice 
their concerns. What do 
they took for in a candidate? 
Are they tired of dishonesty 
in politics? What character- 
istics do they want to see in 
candidates in the upcoming 
elections? Do they believe 
that necessary adjustments 
can be made by those already 
in power, or do they think it 
is time for a change? 

In this present society. 
where the subjects of Iraq. 
stock market dips, rising in- 
terest on student loans and 
mortgages, global warm- 
ing, and immigration sound 
a constant drum beat over 
the heads of Americans, it 
would seem that the right 
to vote become an impera- 
tive to ail citizens. Since the 
elections of the sixties, the 



voter turn out for the block 
of voters from ageslS to 24 
has been consistently low. 
Pursuant to the U. S. Census 
Bureau, in the 2004 presi- 
dential election, this block 
of voters was the lowest of 
all age groups at 58 percent 
compared to those over the 
age of 45 at 70 percent. 

Even though, according lo 
John Fetto of Look Smart, 



ther 



stork 



from 32 percent in 1996, 
and a slight bump in turn out 
in 2000, this block of voters 
have yet to show interest in 
the election of leaders that 
make policy in their world. 
In the late I960's and early 
70s, the voter turn out for 
young Americans skyrock- 
eted due to America's in- 
volvement in the Viet Nam 
War and tne lowering of the 
voting age to 18, 

Draft was an issue that 
sparked controversy among 
other concerns such as civil 
rights and equal rights for 
women. An alternative 
opinion by Seymour Martin 
Lipset (1971), an American 
political sociologist sug- 
gested that the reason that 



voter turn out among young 
adults in the 60s and 70s 
was so great was that more 
of them were found on col- 
lege campuses than in years 
before. 

As in the socio-political 
demographic snapshots of 
years past, today's statistics 
demonstrate that the way to 
reachyoungadults is through 
the internet. "Rock the 
Vote" is a blog that speaks to 
the issues that affect young 
adults. It revealed that ac- 
cording to latest surveys. 3 1 
percent of the 18 to 25 age 
group watch internet video 
clips every day. The CNN/ 
YouTube Democratic Presi- 
dential Debates attracted 
mostly young Americans. 

After this debate. The 
Boston Globe declared that 
young voters are "a growing 
political force". 
Still, the challenge remains 
in the registering of this 
block of voters. "Rock the 
Vote" addresses this with an 
area that enables the user to 
register to vote online.

Finding the strength 
in America's weakness 



BY JASOH BURNET 



I had the pleasure 
recently of attending 
my very first minor 
league Wizards game. 
For those of you not 
in the know, our Fort 
Wayne Wizards are WE 
DiijTor league baseball 
ticket in tovm. It was 
the first baseball game 
I have seen - of any 
sort - since serving 
in the United States 

I often get a double 
take when I tell people 
I'm a vet. Perhaps it's 
the long hair . beard 
and sandals {I've been 
told that I look re- 
markably like a first 
century Hazarene) , or 
perhaps it is my polit- 
ical/religious beliefs 
(anarchist /eastern or- 
thodox) . 

Regardless . it is 
true. 1 was a medic 
and sapper in Uncle 
Sara's Army. It is not 
something I'd ever do 
again, save in the de- 
fense of my home, nor 
is it something I rec- 
rarmend to anyone , but 
it is something I am 
humbly proud of. 

I went to the game in 
the ccaspany of 8 gay 
[Den, Apart from feeling 
like a fifth wheel, as 
I did not have a date, I 
had a great tinie. While 
watching the warm-ups I 
enjoyed at least three 
dollar beers (perhaps 
more, but three cer- 
tainly) and chatted 
with my ccnqianions . 

As the game start tiioe 
drew near, the obliga- 
tory call for standing 
silence went out and a 
young woman came out to 



home plate and began 
our national anthsn. I 
was suddenly struck by 
something that gave me 
great hope. 

Hope is a difficult 
conmodity to lay hands 
on in our nation these 
days . We are involved 
in a war of unjustifi- 
able cost and circum- 
stance that is slowly 
crippling out military, 
alienating our allies 
and bankrupting our 
government . 

Our elected officials 
- Republican and Demo- 
crat ' seem increasing- 
ly out of touch and out 
of step with the wants 
and needs of their cit-

you'd expect - worthy 
of a SiiDon Cowell re- 
jection - but I still

are almost ccrapletely 
unwilling to find any 
cotmon ground to move 
our nation towards 
healing and unity. 

The current Congress 
is a perfect match for 
the current President 
- ineffective, out of 
touch and incompetent. 

Domestic issues are 
equally troublesome. 
The recent bridge col- 
lapse in St. Paul high- 
lights a glaring prob- 
lem - it will take $250 
billion dollars over 
the course of 20 years 
to repair American in- 
frastructure: bridges, 
roads , sewers and the 
like. (By means of a 
contrast, we are spend- 
ing at least $10 bil- 
lion a month in Iraq.) 
Inmigration has divid- 
ed this nation in a way 
unknown since the Abo- 
lition movanent and the 
Civil War. 

New Orleans is still 
in need of a massive 
amount of aid and re- 

We've got problems. 
But as I jEood therr-

cause of the America I 
could see.

children.

People of all colors 
and walks of life. 

That Is An^rica. And 
no matter how incom- 
petently corrupt our 
government (national 
or local), no mat- 
ter how dark the world 
seems , no matter the 
lack of hope, there is 
a strength within us 
- collectively - that 
inspires. We can become 
all we hope the world 
to be, if we can only 
see the humanity we all 
share. 

That is the strength 
of our nation, and for 
that reason I am proud 
that I have served in 
its military. That is 
the nation I hope to 

Incidentally, we lost 
the game. I hope that

something prophetic. 



Smoking ban 
nearing Nazism? 



By BRANDON HARNISH 



We all knew the 
day would come; the 
day v^en the tobac* 
CO warriors would 
stop using intelli- 
gent persuasion to 
fight smoking and 
begin using force 
and coercion to 
prohibit smoking in 
businesses across 
the United States. 
Of course, the only 
legal way to ini- 
tiate force is via 
government , thus it 
is no surprise to 
see the lifestyle 
zealots appeal to 
local governments 
to pass anti-smok- 
ing laws. 

"Walt a min- 
ute , what do you 
mean the tobacco 
warriors are us- 
ing force and co- 
ercion?" one might 
ask. Allow me to 
explain; every law, 
even the most well- 
meaning anti-smok- 
ing law, is backed 
by force . govern- 
ment force. For ex- 
ample, if a new law 
comes down decree- 
ing that smoking 
in businesses open 
to the public is 
henceforth prohib - 
ited and the owner 
responds, "Blah, 
that law is unjust 
and I'm not going 



to follow it," he 
would be forced by 
the government to 
either shutdown or 
obey. That is ini- 
tiating force and 
that is not proper 
policy in a free 
society , 

You might say , 
"Hold it! Even if 
the anti- smokers 
are using force, 
second-hand smoke 
can harm others and 
smokers don't have 
the right to hurt 
others with their 
repulsive billows 
of second-hand to- 
bacco smoke. " 

The fundamental 
question at hand 
is . "Who sets policy 
on private proper- 
ty?" Whether or not 
a business loses 
profit as a result 
of anti - snioking 
laws Is second- 
ary to and ignores 
this essential po- 
litical question. 
In a free society, 
the property owner 
controls his land 
and thus it is up 



him whether 
pe rmit smoking , 
partially restrict 
it, or to ban it 
all together. In a 
controlled and reg- 
imented society , 
the property owner 
is subject to the 
whims of the central 
planners and decid- 
ers of the state 
It might surprise 
you to learn that 
the government of 
Nazi (National So 
cialist) Germany 
embarked on a vig 
orous anti -tobacco 
campaign complete 
with anti-smoking 
propaganda and laws 
prohibiting smoking 
in private bars and 
restaurants . 

The idea that 
business owners 
have the right to 
control policy 
their establishment 
while customers 
have the freedom to 
choose lAiethe: 
not to enter that 
establishment seemi 
perfectly reason- 
able.

Objectionable Material: PolitJdans use twKted v^^ 



Many politicians, 
pundits and public 
relations practitio- 

that American pioliti- 
cal speech sometimes 
resanbles a cant. Eu- 
phemism, spin and other 
seedy arts of political 
speech dull language 
and facilitate mis- 
leading the public. 

In George Oc«ell ' s 
19^6 essay , "Politics 
and the English lan- 
guage," he decried the 
use of anpty, preten- 
tious speech and writ- 



ing. The twisting of 
words is also a recur- 
ring theme in comedian 
George Carlin ' s rou- 
tines. Both have not- 
ed how an injustice 
or tragedy can beccwie 
insignificant or even 
desirable simply by 
changing the words that 
describe it . 

Language - especially 
as powerful and influ- 
ential people use it - 
should be viewed suspi- 
ciously, as should its 



now simply "terror . " 
which a pre-9/ll edi- 
tion of Webster's Dic- 
tionary defines as "a 
state of intense fear."

"What we called 'terrorism' is now 

simply 'terror'.-we allow powerful 

people with unscrupulous motives to

erful people with un- 
scrupulous motives to 
shape our thoughts . 

In Orwell's "1984," 
Big Brother used New- 
speak to impoverish 



English and limit the 
capacity for critical 
and creative thought. 
This doesn't mean "ter- 
ror" and "homeland" 
represent a conspiracy 
to achieve these ends, 
but the impoverishment 
of the language across 
politics, entertainment 
and everyday life could 
still have the same ef- 
fect as Newspeak. 

Yet. one needs only 
to turn on the TV or 
open a newspaper to 
find how generic "ter- 
ror" and "homeland se- 
curity" have become. 

Over time, a word may 
lose its meaning but

Break away from reality with 'Eclipse' 



BY KELLY JONES 

To any high school 
girl, boys and relalionship^ 
can cause a lot of pain and 
confusion. Whai lo do. for 
instance, when you arc in 
love with the most perfect 
guy in the world and it 
turns oui lo be a nightmare, 
lilerally? Then, when you 
finally .•iian to get over the 
pangs and heartaches of 
him going away, your new 
best friend falls for you and 
thai lums oul worse than 
you could have expected. 

For Bella Swan - the 
amazingly intense hero- 
ine in Slephcnie Meyer's 
'Twilight" scries - these 
normal high school prob- 
lems arc magnified a hun- 
dred limes! When she 
moves from her home in 
Phoenix to the small town 
of Forks, Bella doesn't 
think her life will ever be 
qiiilc what it was before. 
She soon Icams Ihat she is 
something of a novelty al 
her new school and nearly 
everyone wants to be her 
friend, except for ihe elu- 
sive Cullens. This family 
seems almost too perfect to 
be human, and Bella soon 
learns that they arc some^ 
thing else completely. Af- 
ter falling for the youngest 
of the Cullens, Edward's 
behavior and side com- 
ments lead her to do a little 
research and Icam that her 
new love is a true vampire. 
Instead of being frightened 
by this fact, Bella becomes 
even more intrigued by 
the family, and by her new 
boyfriend, lo her own dan- 
gerous and difficult ends. 
At ihe end of this install- 



ment. Bella is chased down 
by a less civilized vam- 
pire "tracker," and almost 
killed. This event caused 
Edward to rethink his rela- 
tionship and the pos.sibility 
Ihal it may be hazardous to 
Bella's life to be with him. 

The next year, in "New 
Moon." Bella is distraught 
and depressed, as her love 
has abandoned her "for 
her own good." Bella 
befriends Jacob Black, a 
younger boy from the local 
Native American reserva- 
tion, and he helps her lo 
get over loss. Bella looks 
to Jacob as a combination 
brother and best friend, 
while Jacob yeams for 
her 10 fmally look at him 
the way she used to look 
at Edward. Jacob car- 
ries a secret with him as 
well, which he fears will 
drive Bella away even 
further. When she finds 
out that her best friend is 
a werewolf. Bella real- 
izes that the world she had 
once thought existed was 
whirling away from her 
very quickly. 

In her newest book, 
"Eclipse," we rcvisii 
Bella and Edwards sioty 
once again. Edward has 
relumed lo Bella and they 
arc completely insepara- 
ble. Everything i.s wonder- 
ful, c;^cept for one small 
factor: Bella is growing 
older while Edward slays 
perfectly young and never 
changing. The one wish 
she has for her love is for 
him 10 tum her into one 
of them and make her im- 
mortal. Edward protests 
because he doesn't want 
her to lose her human 
side and, in his mind, her 



soul. He says that he will do 
it only if Bella will marry 
him before it is done, but to 
Bella, marriage al eighlt 
is not something nor- 

do. 

Ste- 
phenie 
Meyer has 
kept readers 
hanging or 
to Ihe slory of 
the romance 
of Bella, a nor- 
mal teenage girl, 
in love with i 
frightening 
mrc. without mak- 
ing anyone believ 
lhat Edward is truly a 

inside. Meyer has 
nearly 1,800 pages 



of Bella and Edward's siory 

(published pages, anyway) 
and left her readers clam- 
oring for 
Through 




ale charac- 
&lt; lhat there 
is no question that they are 
real, even though they may 
not be human. This amaz- 



ing ability to make truly fan- 
tastic characters seem like 

people that could be walk- 
ing amongst us every day 
is a great tale n I, and Meyer 
should be applauded for 
this. Her artful combina- 
tion of romance, action and 
mythology is creative and 
genius. There is no doubl 
in my mind lhat ihe ncxi 
inslallmeni will be just as 
highly anticipated and loved 
as the last three. 

The next chapter in the 
lives of Bella and Edward is 
set to be released in the fall 
of 2008. Meyer's next book. 
"The Host," will be avail- 
able in May of 2008, and 
will be written in Ihe adult 
fiction style, rather than 
young adult.

'Superbad' is superfun, supercrazy 



BY JESSIE RUCKMAN 
ruckj101@lpfw.edu 



Let me first say, if you 
don't appreciate disgusting 
and therefore, truc-io-life 
humor, do not see Superbad. 
But if you're like the other 
99 percent of young adults, 
this movie was hands down 
the funniest fhovie I have 
seen in years, if not ever! 
To be honest, I had begun 
lo lose my faith in the slap- 
stick humor genre, noting 
that many attempts at humor 
have gone incredibly, and 
stupidly wrong. Not Super- 
bad! 

From the moment the 
lir^t scene unfolded, i could 
hardly calch my breath for 
laughing so hard. Unbe- 
lievably perverted and still 
somehow sweet, this movie 
highlights the adventure of 



three total nerds: Selh (Jonah 
Hill). Evan (Michael Cera), 
and of course Fogell, more 
widely known as McLovin 
(Christopher Mimz-Plasse). 
Evan takes a page from the 
understated humor remi- 
niscent of The Office and 
makes it his own, anchor- 
ing the outrageous and u fl- 
ee n so red dirtiness of Scth's 
rants. The irio of boys has 
one common goal: to gel 
laid licforc leaving for col- 
lege. 

The success of their plan lo 
get some hinges on Scth's 
ability lo score booze for 
the token high school bosh, 
and luckily Fogell thought 
ahead and purchased a 
fake ID, renaming himself 
"McLovin". Unfortunately 
for McLovin. just as he is in 
Ihe liquor store to make the 
purcha.sc. the store is held 
up and he takes one hell of 
a punch to the face, and of 



course the police arc called. 
Enter Scth Rogen and part- 
ner, and hilarity ensues as 
the three buddies attempt 
10 reconnect but ultimately 
face their own unique chal- 
lenges, with one goal: make 
it to the party, gel the giri, 
and get a room. 
Despite the fact that I was on 



a date, I think I fell in love 
with McLovin just a little 
bit. And I think it's safe to 
say that neither my date nor 
myself went longer than a 
minute without laughing out 
loud, because even though 
there were many "eew, 
gross!" moments (example: 
menstrual hijinx) they were 



all possible to a certain de- 
gree, Gramcd, I'm not sure 
in what world these hypo- 
thetical events would all 
take place in one night to one 
group of people, but that's 
why movies are magic. 
My advice: go see this one 
if you arc a.) a fan of per- 
version in every sense of 



the word, b.) remember lo 
raid the popcorn stand and 
use the restroom before the 
movie begins, because if 
you have the stomach for 
di.sgusting and likely iruc 
humor, there arc no oppor- 
tune moments lo gel up. 
And trust me, you don't

New Vice Chancellor wields positive agenda 




Being unfamiliar with a 
new enviomment could 
be a frightening ex- 
perience. For the new 
Vice Chancellor of Stu- 
dent Affairs, arriving 
to IPFW on July 1st was 
an exciting ne»f oppor- 
tunity and a chance to 
be part of a univer- 
Etiy adndst a hopeful- 
ly positive change. 

Bom to a military 
family, -Dr. George Hc- 
Clellan spent his ear- 
lier years moving frcsa 

bom in Florida, and 
soon after his family 
was off to Alaska, then 
Alabama. Pennsylvania, 
Kansas . Texas . llli - 
nols, Arizona, North 
Dakota, and now. Indi- 



While settling in 
Chicago for 20 years , 
Dr. McClellan ccanplete 
his Masters and Ph.D in 
higher education, more 
specifically, student 
affairs. Infact. he's 
written a few chapters 
in the leading book on 
student affairs , ti - 
tied. "The handbook of 
Student Affairs Admin- 
istration. '■ 

His sensitivity with 
culture and the dif- 
ferece between people 
Influenced his deci- 
sion to pursue a mi- 
nor in Native American 
studies , which deep- 
ened his appreciation 
for different beliefs. 
While working with poor 



ties it became a goal 



of his to help Native 
Americans get througji 
college . 

Here at IPEVJ, Dr. Mc- 
Clellan plans to be an 
advocate for students 
and their ambitions . 
On a systematic level 
he's hoping to be apart 
of IFFW's movement as a 
great school, with po- 
tential for numerical 
growth at a continued 
great value. He's here 
to see more students 
become more full time, 
recognize and resf&gt;ect 
ful to diversity, and a 
potential for doctoral 
offerings. "I will be 
here as long as oth- 
ers and I feel I'm con- 
tributing to this cam- 
pus- ultimately, I'm a 
learner . "

Cut all-nighters! You'll appreciate it 



By KELLIE HOSES 



Probably since you 
first hit puberty you 
have been counting down 
the days until gradua- 
tion, leaving for col- 
lege, saying goodbye to 
your parents, and say- 
ing hello to your new- 
ly found freedom! It's 
that new freedom that 
gets you Into predica- 
ments that neither higji 
school nor SOAR could 
prepare you for. 

Uhen your alarm goes 
off and you don't roll 
out of bed until 20 
minutes AFTHl it first 
sounds, you ate sudden- 
ly regretting that late 
night study session 
you had vdth Profes- 
sor Television and his 
teaching assistant Xbox 



360. You know, the one 
where you study all 
night long to get to 
the final level in the 
game? Uh, I mean chap- 
ter in the book. 

We are all guilty of 
those late nighters , 
but it's how you handle 
your tijne and respon- 
sibilities that sepa- 
rate you from the other 
12 . 000 students doing 
the same. As fresh- 
men , time nonagsnent 
couldn't be stressed 
any more. Now, I don't 
expect the late Mght 

come to a halt because 
in all honesty. 

On the other hand , 
I am offering three 
sijnple study tips that 
can improve or help 
your time management 
skills. 

1. Plan ahead. 

Know what needs to be 



completed and vrfien it 
is due . No sense of 
staying up Thursday 
night writing a paper 
when it isn't due until 
Monday. 

2. Stay on top of 
homework. When you get 
a break in the day, do 
some homework . Don ' t 
just sit online looking 
at your Facebook ac - 
count. If it's 10 a.m., 
people are either at 
class or sleeping, NOT 
CH FACEEOOK CX»MEWriWS 
ON YOUR PICWRES. 

3. Cut back on your 
"study sessions . " I 
know they say for every 
hour spent IH class, 
you should study at 
least two hours OtTT of 
class. However, cutting 
the sessions short and 
going to bed before the 
sun comes up will defi- 
nitely Improve your day 
overall .

Irish pub brings class to the Fort 



Scott and Melissa 
Glaze, continuing their 
tireless effort to breathe 
new life into Fort Wayne's 
downtown ase^. opened 
J.K. O'donnell's Irish Ale 
House in mid-August with 
help from experienced 
restaurant managers- Kim 
Jacobs and Fritz Hoffman. 
The alehouse did not 
splash onto the scene with 
a media blitz of radio and 
print advertisements and 
a grand opening celebra- 
tion. Nonetheless, word 
of a new metropotilan hot 
spot in downtown Fort 

Wayne spread, 

and the place 
has been hop- 
ping since open- 
ing night. 

I was driving 
down Wayne 
Street alone on 
the road at a 
quarter till nine 
on a Wednes- 
day night. I was 
thinking' abouf 
the places and 
events that make 
Fort Wayne tol- 
erable (maybe 
I'll list them an- 
other time). I 
had high hopes thai this 
new pub was going to 
make that list for the fol- 
lowing reasons: (1) I like 
the idea of going down- 
town to hang out instead 
of to a strip mall. (2) I like 
a good beer selection (and 
J.K.'s may have the best 
I've seen around here}. (3) 



Interesting food is more ex- 
citing than hot wings and 
burgers. (4) I viewed their 
website (|kodonnel1s com) 
- the buoyant attitude it 
projects IS appealing 

As I parallel parked 
across from the new pub, 
HI be damned if I didn't 
see real live people loiter- 
ing around the facade of 
this place. This was not 
the vacant downtown area 
I know and mourn. People 
on bikes were stopping 
on the sidewalk to chat 
with diners m O'Donnell's 
streetside patio. Twenty- 
somelhings were sending 
cell phone invitations be- 
fore heading back inside. 




barrels, 
high 
stools, 
I w 

stools, 
padded 
or un- 
padded 
chairs, 
and of 
course 
the pa- 
tio furniture. I found a 
cove, and sat upon a tall 
church pew. As I waited 
(quite a long time) for a 
server I perused the beer 
list. It is a successful at- 
tempt to standout with 




Inside, the pub was loud 
with conversation ampli- 
fied by drink and bouncing 
hard off the wooden floor. 
There was no host/hostess. 
Where to sit? They have a 
bar, a lesser bar against a 
wall, booths whose backs 
are topped with celtic de- 
signed stained glass, ta- 



beers that are unavailable 
elsewhere in town in ad- 
dition to familiar favorites. 
The list Includes Warbird's 
new Insh Shanty (a red ale 
brewed in Fort Wayne, ex- 
clusively for J.K.'s). If you 
are looking for J5 buck- 
ets of Bud, this isn't the 
place. 



tasty and so were the 
chips. Well, they are really 
just your typical steak fries 
rather than chips They 
come with garlic aioli and 
Irish curry. Both of these 
are a big improvement 
on the ketchup 
or honey mustard 
that usually ac- 
companies fries, 
and the sauces 
taste good alone 
or mingled to- 
gether. 

The patrons were 
a mix of young 
professionals, old- 
er couples. There 
was also a spat- 
tering of art types 
and young intel- 
lectuals (read: big 
lie Pyle beards, tattoos, 
and Che Guevara 
t-shirts). O'don's 
is a sit and chat, pull up 
a chair kind of place, not 
a stand and walk around 
kind of place. The Insh 
pub atmosphere is laid 
back. Unfortunately the 
service has also adopted 
a laid back approach to 
working. Otfiers I have 
spoken to attest to the 



slow service. 

I wanted to have an 
authentic Irish food experi- 
ence so 1 ordered from the 
'traditional Insh fare' sec- 
tion of the well-designed 
menu (by One Lucky Gui- 
tar a standout local design 
company) When it arrived 
with a Warbird Insh Shanty 
red ale the Ruby Red Trout, 
garnished with fresh dill 
and capers, looked more 
like a Mediterranean dish 
than the meat and 'tators 
kind of plate one expects 
from Irish cuisine (though 
that is available also). It 
was delicious, and left me 
with room for dessert. 

It was served with a 
side of barley salad, a cold

Diaries of the intrepid dater 



BY JESSIE RUCKMAN 

rud(j101@ipfw.cdu 



Murky waters, sex. 
The boundaries of sex with 
commitment are hazy, like 
walking through a sticky, 
opaque fog patch that has 
just rolled m off the coast 
of Africa-although there 
IS no way you can know 
there is danger ahead, you 
can sense it around ev- 
ery corner. You may ask 
yourself, while fumbling 
around blindly, waiting for 
the relationship reaper to 
come claim his latest los- 
er: 'how the hell did I get 
here?' 

And as you struggle to 
find the link between then 
(a relatively peaceful, yet 



lonely time) and now (a 
jumble of mixed-up feel- 
ings waiting to explode 
in your face}, you realize 
that the state of Fnend- 
swiihbenefits, located |ust 
south of Oops, sucks. 

That no-strings-at- 
tached feeling of sexual 
freedom becomes all jum- 
bled up and next thing 
you know, you're hope- 
lessly tietJ up by invisible 
strings that have no busi- 
ness wrapping themselves 
around you. 

But you keep moving 
forward, and as you make 
your way to certain misery, 
warm Technicolor memo- 
ries of just how you landed 
here begin to trickle back 
into your consciousness. 

A look, 

A touch. 



A friend who, out of 
nowhere, becomes de- 
cidedly more than just a 
fnend. 

And the next thing you 
know, you are a friend 
with benefits, right next 
to me, fumbling your way 
through the murky mist. 
Wondering how you land- 
ed yourself here. 

Oh, c'mon, get prudish 
on me now! Be brave and 
walk with me on our little 
journey through the an- 
nals ol f 'SiSbuddydom. 

The rules: no expeaa- 
tions, no strings- just a 
simple phone call or text 
and-bang (if you'll pardon 
the pun)-instant gratifica- 
tion, and you both walk 
away singing along to 
whatever's rocking the 
iPod, 



Right? 

Having a special friend 
is perfect when both par- 
ties are all on the same 
page. 

Just like Napoleon Dy- 
namite's famous Liger, you 
just don't see that every 
day. 

It's not possible to have 
a no strings attached re- 
lationship because one 
inevitably wants more or 
less than the other, jeal- 
ousy pops up, friendship 
fades when you find out 
the other person snores 
like a frigging buzz saw... 
but that's not the point. 

Feelings tend to get 
hurt, and in Blake's case, 
so did his face, Thisiswhat 
happens when the murky 
waters of f "&amp;@buddydom 
become dangerous. 



{kind of like cooked rice), 
and bits of red and yellow 
peppers m an Italian-ish 
dressing. While spooning 
the salad into my mouth 
with chunks of trout I real- 
ized that the pamng could 
not have been more per- 
fea. 

As I ordered the bread 
and butter pudding. 1 
saw two friends roll up 
on bikes. They pulled up 
chairs and we shared a 
round of pints (this time 
the German Oinkel Acker 
Pilsner). 

On my way home. I 
reviewed my night on the 
town and concluded that 
m spite of the slow sen/ice, 
I could in fact add J.K. 
O'Donnell's to my list.

Dogfighting troubles are only the

derella "story, give up 
aliDost Sl.OO million to 
take ■ parr -in illegal 
dogfighting^ -Snd con- 
spiracy?-. ' 

Ask; 'aichael Vick. 
quartetback'.Of .the At- 
lanta Falcons., Vick, 
27 , recently pled 
guilty to interstate 
dogfighting. but in- 
sists that he hijnself 
never placed bets on 
the outcome. 

"For someone with 
Vlck'E wealth, there 
was a world of legal 
delights to select 
from. He could coninand 
the lights of Vegas , 
the beaches' of Barba- 
dos, the cafes of Par- 
is," said, Steve Hunfoer 
of the Atlanta Jour- 
nal-Constitution. But 
for all qf the legal 
things Mjney could buy, 
Vick allegedly chose 
dogfighting for enter- 
tainirent. 

The bill for Michael 
Vick's role in illegal 
dogfighting could reach 
upwards of $100 million 
in lost fut\lre salary, 
endorsanents , and re- 
payment of bonuses , 
which may be deinanded 
by the Falcons due to 
contractual default , 
according to XXXXX. 

Ihe dogfighting ring 
known as Bad Newz Ken- 
nels is only the latest 
in a string of debacles 
in the life of Michael 
Vick. There was the 
herpes lawsuit of 2005. 
the water bottle fi- 
asco in Miami, and of 
course the incident in 
New Orleans where Vick 
flipped his middle fin- 
ger to fans after a 

When Vick was drafted 
to the Falcons in 2001 , 
not many thought that 
the Cinderella story 
would have had such 
an unhappy ending, and 



perhaps the most in- 
sulting of all for Vick 
is the issue of money. 
The scene of much of 
the trainijig, housing 
and staging of- the., dog- 
fights took place on a. 
farm purchased by Vick 
in 2001 ■ for approxi- 
mately _^_

as the opportunity to 
play football again. 
NFL coDini^ioner roger 
Goodell notified Vick 
of his suspiension in a 
letter, arid added that 
Vick's "admitted con- 
duct was not only. ille- 
gal, but also cruel and 



"Hehasjustbeaxne 

radioactive" 

-MaicGanis 



charge to enter a fight 
was about SI. 500. Sot 
much of a prize for 
scsneone whose contract 
with the Falcons was 
worth more than Sl30 
million, plus $35 mil- 
lion sign-on and roster 
bonuses. 

"He has just become 
radioactive." said Mace 
Ganis , presidrait of 
Sportscorp Ltd., based 
in Chicago. 

It wasn't just fi- 
nances that seem to 
be in the garbage for 
Vick. He stands to 
lose endorsanents, in- 
cluding Nike, as well 



reprehensijile.; * Your 
team, the; NFL' and NFL 
fans have all beenJiurt 
by your actions." 

Not only did Vick 
sponsor the dogfights, 
but he also allegedly 
killed many dogs that 
did not perform well 
by means of hanging, 
drowning, and in one 
case throwing a dog 
against a wall. But 
Vick is not taking the 
fall all by himself, 
stipulating that the 
dogs died "as a re- 
sult of the collective 
efforts of [Pumell] 
Peace. [Quania] Phil- 



lips and Vick." 

The actions admit - 
ted to by Vick could 
keep him from playing 
in the NFL for years, 
if ever. 

But what about fol- 
lowing in Ricl^ Wil- 
liams' footsteps and 
playing in the Canadian 
Football League after 
being suspended by the 
NFL7 

CFL comnissioner Hark 
Cohon said in a recent 
statement. "In response 
to media inquiries re- 
garding the possibil - 
ity of Michael Vick 
playing in the CFL, I 
would like to clarify 
that any NFL players, 
who are currently un- 

ing a suspension, are 
prohibited from sign- 
ing a CFL player con- 
tract as outlined by 
the League's governing 
documents . " 

If found guilty of 
charges of dogfighting. 
Vick could face 12-18 
months; if convicted of 
conspiracy, the Falcon 
quarterback could face 
up to 5 years in pris-

Intra murals offer 
free body blast 



BY JESSIE RUCKHAN 
Euckjl01@lpfw.edu 



The IPFW Intra- 
murals have in- 
troduced many new 
sports to students , 
free of charge. And 
starting Aug. 27, 
they will be intro- 
ducing another ath- 
letic option to the 
table. 

"Body Blast is a 
new option for stu- 
dents who want to 
take a break from 
stress, and have 
fun without having 
competition, " said 
Ron Clark. Director 
of Intramurals . 

J&gt;ie classes will 
be held twice per 



week on Tuesday and 
Thursday, with two 
separate areas of 
focus: cardio and 







core building. 

Tuesdays will fo- 
cus on varied car- 
dio exercises, and 
Thursdays will fea- 
ture equipment for 
the core muscles 
such as Therabands 
and pilates balls. 
The classes are 



walk- in only , and 
only the first 22 
students are al - 
lowed each day. 

"I would definite- 
ly use [aerobics 
classes] beause I 
have been wanting 
to start exercising 
but I need motiva- 
tion. It's hard to 
exercise regularly, 
but this would make 
it much easier." 
said Stephanie Sav- 
age . senior .

Body Blast classes,

Match time cut short as storm rolls in

athletic department 



The IPFW women's soc- 
cer team dropped a 3- 
decision to Illinois 
State this afternoon 
in an erfiibition con- I 
test at the Hefner i 
Soccer Complect. 

The match was halt - I 
ed with 25:36 re- I 
maining because of ' 
a Btorm system that 
passed through the 
Fort Wayne area. 

The Redbirds cracked 
the scoring column in 
the 27th minute of 
play. Junior forward 
Mel Routledge dribbled 
deep into Mastodon ter- 
ritory, deeked her way 
around IPFW goalkeeper 
Lindsi Myhre, and fired 
a shot on goal. 

The ball clanked off 
of the post , but the 
rebound fell right at 
the feet of Redbitd 
forward Alyssa Schulz 
who found the back of 
an open net. 

Just five minutes 
later the Redbirds 
struck again. Sopho- 
more midfielder Anman- 



da Wisniei^ski launched 
a perfect throw- in to 
a streaking Roucledge. 
vAo had Myhre at her 
mercy. 

Routledge fired off 
a shot to the far side 
making it 2-0. In the 




Photo by 

5lGt minute. Schulz got 
her second goal of the 
match. 

Dribbling the right 
side of the Mastodons' 
defense. Schulz sent a 
ball toward the net. 
Myhre was screened in 
front and never saw the 
shot, which found its 
way into the right side 
of the goal. IPFW began 
to find its legs a bit 
after that, making a 
few strong runs at the 



Redbirds . 

Junior forward Dani- 
elle Orlandella had a 
great opportunity at 
the 53:02 mark. Or- 
landella weaved her 
way through the ISU de- 
fense and let a shot 
go from about 
15 yards out. 
Looking to 
park the ball 
just under 
the crossbar. 
Orlandella's 
blast was 
just about 
six inch- 
es off the 
nark. 

Then, the 
Kelly Jones thunder and 
lightning took 
over, cutting the match 
short. Myhre made seven 
saves for IPFW in the 
match. Redbird net- 
minders Katl Grill - 
Donovan and Courtney 
Blake each turned back 
a Mastodon shot . IPFW 
will begin the 2007 
season on Friday, Au- 

They travel to Hun- 
cie, Indiana to take on 
Ball State University

From Page 4 

Iran exited the "free 
world" in 1979 \jhen it 
overthrew a brutal, US- 
backed, qiiasi-fascist 
regime and replaced it 
with a bnital, albe- 
it native , theocratic 

Another good example 
is "free market." Ldb- 
ertarians and conser- 
vatives love that term. 



associating it with 
mass satisfaction and 
liberty and portraying 
it as the American way. 
In practice, however, 
it usually means elind- 
nating regulations and 
letting big business 
pollute the environ- 
ment , monopolize in- 
dustries, privatize the 
public sphere, exploit 



workers, advertise dis- 
honestly and sell' un- 
safe products, thereby 
harMng the public good 
and exacerbating in- 
equality. Thus, people 
who already have power 
and wealth gain free- 
dom, while those with- 
out power and wealth 

But be warned; Agree- 



ing vri-th anything in the 
previous paragraph con- 
stitutes "socialism. " 
We all know socialism 
is bad. The word alone 
says it all. 

As such, the inher- 
ent evil of "socialism" 
makes health care for 
all easy for politi- 
cians with vested in- 
the health 



insurance industry to 
demonize as "social- 
ized medicine." 

Then we have "family 
values." Herriam-Web- 
Ster defines a value 
as "something (as a 
principle or quality) 
intrinsically valu- 
able or desirable. " 
In American politics, 
however , "values" is 



nothing but a 
for gay bashing and a 
surrogate for outright 
hate speech. It enables 
one to harbor prejudice 
without considering, 
let alone admitting, 
that he is prejudiced.
