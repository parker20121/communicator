Earth Day Yesterday; What Is Today? 



BY KAREN GRIGGS ^ 

April 22 began as a 
day of fantastic acti- 
vity. The sound system 
in the lounge was good 
Tor a change , Displays 
continued to be set up 
throughout the morning 
in the lounge and in

filled, with very few 
people smoking in re- 
sponse to signs. As 
Goerge Lowe reminded 
the audience, •^^tj-pH 22 
was Queen Elizabeth's 
birthday, the 2nd day 
of Passover, and J-enir* 
birthday ( applause ; , 
Lowe was actually the 
finest speaker of the 
day. The audience re- 



sponse oo uis dramatic 
concern tnd vivid exam- 
ples was apparent by 
overpowering as Mr. 
Lowe nearly broke his 
back in a fall off the 
platform. 

Attendance through 
the day grew to a peak 
at 1 p,m, when Vf^nce

key of pessimism, as he

Nusbaunner Gains Presidency 



The A,R,C. conven- 
tion, which was held 
April 17, 16, and 19, 
brought forth many new 
changes for the Ass- 
ociation of Regional 
Campuses. Among these 
a new constitution, new 
officers, the purpose 
A,F,C., and some short 
term goals. 

It was stated by the 
newly elected pres- 
ident, Mike Nusbaumer, 
that the purpose of 
A.R.Co is to set up a 
state-wide functioning 



organization to serve 
and protect the some 
50,000 students at 10 
regional campuses 
throughout the state. 
This was more or leas 
the theme of the whole 
convention. 

It was unanimously 
decided that an elec- 
tion ofnew officers was 
necessary for the 
betterment of the or- 
gamization. The new 
officers are as follows:

and Snider appeared at 
least as concerned as 
local students. 

The speakers of the 

day were a variety of 

windy, serious, formal, 

casual, exciting and 

i boring men. Pew women, 

(even students) spoke. 

By dinner, the surge of 

attendance was over. 

Students assigned to 

write or report on the 

activities of the day 

had finished their note 

taking. 

The question in this 
observer's mind at the 
quiet close of the day 
is: If you learned 

anything, what are you 
going to do now, per- 
sonally??? 



President Nixon says it's "now 
or never" in describing pollution 
as the big domestic issue of the 
'70s. To find out what rnan thinks 
can be done, the editors and wri- 
ters of the "Communicator" have 
compiled an indepth study of the 
Pollution Teach-In Day for the 
benefit of our readers. 

Starting on page 14 , a com- 
plete coverage of last Wednesday

Look At Candidal^ 



nk Akey 

Many things have been said for and against Stu- 
dent Government's responsible and/or irresponsi- 
ble actions and reactions in the past school year. 
Inasmuch as a Student Government supposedly repre- 
sents the students who elect is as a governing 
and protecting body, it seems that the few stu- 
dents who voted during the last election more than 
deserved their student governraetit. The very poor 
turnout in Student Body Elections in years past 
illustrated that a small well unified miicrity can 
control the student opinion. Once a body takes 
'power' it can either screw the students totally 
or protect the Tew meagpr rights that the student 
has. In the pase,such minority groups as frater- 
nities, sororities, and the S.L.F, have been able 
to manipulate the Student Government. Understand, 
I am not judging these groups as being good or 
bad, but merely pointing out that each year mino- 
t'ity groups can win elections against or at least 
not strongly with the wishes of the majority of 
the students. In fact, each year many students 
will complain about the quality and the responsi- 
'bility of members of Student Government, but when 
Ut is* election time the majority of students fail 
to vote and the ones who do vote seem to have been 
pulled on the bandwagon by personalities and 
catchy phrases rather than by important issues 
and consideration of quality legislators. If the 
students want to have a Student Government which 
represents them, and if they want a Student Gov-

As of this time two groups have filed petitions 
for offices. Each is running nearly full slates 
of candidates. Each will be docketed separately!

jwill vote completely along party lines; each will 
I in fact attempt to pull students on the band 
jwagon and vote conservative liberal. It is con- 
iceivable that each might sling mlid at the other! 
and participate in other questionable political I 
activities to get more votes. I ask, however, ' 
that during the campaign and during the election 
that voters do the Impossible. I ask that they 
examine the competence of the candidates and look 
at the issues they represent. I further ask that 
each voter make a responsible judgment and vote 
accordingly on election days . Only in this way 
can the students at Indiana-Purdue University 
Ft. Wa3me have a representative and responsible 
Student Government, 

However, one may question the validity of any 
student government's exlstance. What has it done 
in the past? What rights for the student has it 
won? When will it attempt to fully represent the 
views of the students? It may be considered folly 
but what Student Government has fone and what it 
has the potential to do in the future are two 
Very different things. After all, it is far eas- 
ier to shrug off an organization as not doing 
anything worthwhile than it is to join the move- 
ifitint and change it. Student Government can mean 
something. It can represent students, it can 
protect them from the clutches of the administra- 
tion. It can save them from the auspices of our 
illustrious state legislature; but it can only 
do so if the students want it and are willing to 
break ass to get it moving. Participate nowl

A class of 300 down

elsewhere.

Have you ever felt 
crowded in our school? 
Well here's a few opin- 
ions on one of the ways 
we could stop the prob- 
lem. One of the ways 
is the question for

fixing enrollment temp-

the most qualified stu- 
dents, to remedy the 
overcrowding of our 
school?"

SNEAK THIEF 
SACKS LIBRARY 

Attention all of you 
Sherlock Holmes and 
Dick Traceysl Here's 
your big chance. Since 
last Christmas, the 
regional campus library, 
has been the scene of; 
fourteen thefts ofi 
purses. Of these four-| 
teen, all but two ofi 
the purses have beenj 
recovered. The thief 
or thieves have yet to 
be caught in the act, 
but it seems that 
whoever it is does not 
plan to make a collect- 
ion of his newly- 
acquired possessions. 
The thief has a habit 
of returning them to 
such out-of-the-way 
places as inside the 
trash cans in the men's 
restroom, by the river 
outside Concordia High 
School, and beside 
Highway ?l+ close to 
Hoagland. 

Because of the 
subtle way in which the 
thefts are performed, 
Officer Warnock said it 
would be a good idea to 
"keep possessions well 
in hand" in order to 
prevent any more of 
these thefts.

Editorial 



PURDUE-INDIANA THEATRE REVISITED - by 0. Franklin Kenworthy 

Director of Theatre 
Purdue University 
Fort Wayne Campus 

Since I am the "Mr. Administrator" referred to in last week's editorial by 
William D. Roberts, a reply at this time seems in order. As you recall, the 
editorial suggests that the administration is shifting the costs of operating 
the theatre program onto the "overburdened shoulders" of students, and it asks 
if this ratio of student--administration financial imput is justified. 

In point of fact, the administration is not shifting the costs of operating the 
theatre program onto the students, but is working in totally the opposite 
direction, i . e . to relieve students ultimately of any activity fee for theatre 
and have only the user pay through the purchase of tickets. This policy has 
been In effect for two years. Of course, we were in line (as was everybody else) 
for a bigger share of the pie when the activity fee increase was instituted. It 
helped get us on a firm financial footing and pay some outstanding bills. Given 
this help, it is our job now to push the process of student relief as best we can. 
Let's review what has been done in this area. 

Since the theatre began operation 5 years ago, the amount of administrative 
support to the program has increased approximately 8% each year to the present 
level of $4300.00. Whenever possible, savings which were created from these 
increases have been passed to the students. Two years ago, with the help of 
increased administrative money and the increased student activity fee, we were 
able to lower our prices to students to 50^ per admission. There will be no 
price increase next year. Our request to the student's government for next year 
was $500.00 lower than the amount we received this year because of the increased 
administrative support and our projected income from ticket sales; and this was 
done in the face of rising building costs at 1% per month. 

The trend is clear. Students will continue to shoulder lighter burdens as the 
University increases its support of the theatre program. But this change will 
continue slowly. In any financial area, change within the University is pain- 
fully slow. And we in the theatre ask that, in the process, our financial noses 
not be tut off to spite your zeal for instant reform. 

The point of information you seek regarding lab fees for theatre courses, Mr. 
Roberts, could have been answered by the most fundamental research on your part, 
and I am sorry that space must be used here for information you could have found 
in the Purdue catalog. Yes, lab fees are charged on all courses except our 
straight lecture-discussion classes. Even our Acting and Stage Movement classes, 
while using no materials, have lab fees. 

One final point to those who allocated $5200.00 to the theatre for 1970-71. It 
is going to be extremely difficult operating on that amount of student activity 
support. Such fundamental things to our program as the Indiana Theatre Company 
will have to be cut. I do not wish to take that action, and request that the 
allocation to PIT be reconsidered.

purpose of this is to

VISTA on 
Campus 

The program known as 
Volunteers in Service 
to America (VISTA) has 
made a complete organ- 
izational overhaul and 
as a result you, the 
student, will be giv.en 
an opportunity to join, 
its ranks or at least, 
find out something a-: 
bout it between thel 
dates of April 27 and' 
,29. During this time! 
VISTA recruiters will 
be located in the caf- 
eteria in front of G-2 
from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 
p.m. each day in order 
to inform interested 
students about VISTA 's 
accomplishments and 
failures, and its hopes 
and aims. 

VISTA, which is a 
national corps of vol- 
unteers working to eli- 
minate poverty in the 
United States, has 
turned to the college 
campus to strengthen 
some of its weak points. 
An evaluation by the 
Associated Press spot- 
ted several of these 
weak points as beingt 
1. Inadequate training 
for the sudden adjust- 
ment to the pest-holes 
of poverty. 2. The 



high rate of volunteers 
who quit before their 
full year in VISTA ex- 
pires. 3. The high 
percentage of volun- 
teers who are inept, 
immature teenagers com- 
ing to VISTA to try to 
solve their own 
problems rather than 
those of the poor. 

As a result of the 
realization of these 
faults, many VISTA pro- 
jects have been closed 
down, teen-aged drop- 
outs are being turned 
away, and more lawyers 
who can bring expert 
help to the poor are 
being sought. 

If you are interest- 
ed in finding out more 
about the new, improved 
VISTA be sure to talk 
to the VISTA recruiter 
who will be here April 
27 through 29 during 
the times mentioned,

room G-2 at7:00 p.m. on 
April ?7th and 28th.

be noted that the error

Three years ago 
there was an organiza- 
tion called the Mental 
Health Technician's As- 
sociation formed on 
this campus. It was 
initiated by several 
Mental Health students 
for the purpose of de- 
veloping professional 
services to promote the 
Mental Health movement 
of upholding desirable 
ethical and e ducational 
standards for workers 
in the field, and of 
supporting research ef- 
forts in t his field. 

At the present,' 
there are twenty mem-' 
bers in the organiza- 
tion who meet monthly 
and discuss topics suchi 
as problems in mental: 
health therapy. Also' 
speakers from both In- 
side and outside the 
campus are brought in 
to further Inform and 
encourage mental health 
students. An associate 
degree is required to 
be a full-fledged mem- 
ber; however, students 
who are working toward 
their degree may be ad- 
mitted as an associate 
member. The group is 
looking for interested 
and committed students 
in t he fields of Mental 
Health, Sociology, or 
P3ycholo,--;y to join 
their organization.

Cuba 
Aired 



First Estate of the 
lU-PU Regional Campus 
presented a program en- 
titled "The Cuban Revo- 
lution** as another at- 
tempt to present a var- 
iety of political views 
to the campus &lt;&gt; 

Dr. Rodrif?n^ez, Dr. 
Menocal, and Mr. Alex 
Mueller were guest 
speakers and Mr. Steve 
Pettyjohn moderated. 

Dr. Rodriguez pre- 
sented a political and 
historical background 
of Cuba. He stressed 
t at Cuba has only been 
a nation for thirty 
years and that it has 
had its problems, one 
of which was attempting 
to maintain fi n institu- 
tion of democracyo- He 
was opposed to Batista 
and noted that it was 
the middle class that 
gave support to Castro. 

Dr. Menocal gave an 
economic interpreta- 
tion of Cuba. He no- 
ted that the fact that 
very few Cuvan ' s don't 
own land is not a fact 
but merely a myth. 
This ratio of land to 
people wa- made through 
a false set of statis- 
tics. He stated the 
economic situation is 
not as bad as is pain- 
ted by Castro's friends 
in the U.S. He also 
said that the U.S. firns 
didn't own the majori- 
ty of sugar cane fields 
and mills. in I938 
they owned ?/3 but in 
1950 the figure was 
practically reversed. 



Rowdiness May 
Cause H.S. Ban 

The actions by a few 
rowdy teen-agers during 
the past three dances 
held in the lU-PU Stu- 
dent Lounge may be the 
cause of a ruling that 
will bar admission to 
any student without 
a college I.D. card. 

It seems that during 
these dances quite a 
bit of damage was done 
to various areas of the 
Regional Campus with a

ENDORSEMENT 



At their weekly 
Board of Directors 
meeting last Thursday 
night, the Democratic 
Progressives of Port 
Wayne, Allen County, I 
and the lU-PU campus 
prepared a statement 
paper endorsinp the 
candidacy of J. Edward 
Eoush for the l+th Dis- 
trict Congressional 
seat. Citing especial- 
ly the Roush Record on 
Pollution and Conserva- 
tion, the Chairman of 
the organization, Bruce 
Stier, said: "Ed Roush 
fought in the halls of 
Congress for Pollution 
Control since he first 
went to Congress back 
in 1958. At a time 
when little was being* 
done to correct envir-f 
oninental problems Roush; 
was one of those f ew j 
"leaders" in Congress'' 
who took a strong anti-| 
pollution starid. 

Roush' s opponent, E. 
Ross Adair, on the 
other hand is a "Johnny 
come lately" on the pol- 
lution scene. Mr. A- 
dalr's record on pollu- 
tion has been consist* 
ently inconsistent, Nai 
that Pollution Con- 
trol and Environmental 
Problems have been pop- 
ularized, however, Mr. 
Adair has jumped on the 
bandwagon after years 
of apathy, 

Mr. Roush' s record 
as a "leader" in the 
fight against pollution 
is in stark contrast to 
Mr, Adair's record as a 
"follower".

PSA PLATFORM 



Because we (PSA) feel it our solemn duty, as responsible students to as- 
sure that the moneys paid to, and trust vested in, the student government 
are properly and responsibly tendered and. 

Because we have concluded that the people recently in power in stu- 
dent government have flaunted their authority and carelessly wasted the 
student's money and. 

Because we disapprove of a student government ha\»ing close ties with po- 
werful political forces, especially when such forces do not act in the best 
interests of the student body, we hereby present our platform to serve the 
student of tiiis campus: 

1, We pledge not to ally ourselves with any organization person or office 
outside of this campus. 

2, We pledge to thoroughly examine all expansion and operation costs in- 
curred by the administrators of this campus and if found unnecessary or ex- 
horbiatant expenditures to file suit to stop such action, 

3, We pledge to push for more on-campus jobs for students. We feel t hat 
students can maintain the campus grounds at less cost to the school than 
the present maintenance personnel© 

l\.m We pledge to lower the $l5»00 activities fee now in effect, 
&gt;, Our cafeteria Is one of two in the state with a sales tax. We will 
work to eliminate this tax, 

6. The study areas on our overcrowded campus leave a great deal to be 
desired. We pledge to make available more study areas, 

?• ^^any times, in 'the normal course of events, students and instructors 
come into conflict, Thesre instances are not always the fault of the stu- 
dent nor always the f ault of the Instructor. We pledge to set up an authoi^ 
itative committee composed of both students and faculty to review sueh 
grievances, 

8, We pledge to make the committees, responsible for examining bookstore 
and cafeteria prices, truly effective, 

9, We feel that students who&lt;fesire education simply for the sake of 
education should be allowed this without being a strapped to requisites 

of baccalaureate programs consisting of classes the student does not desire, 
lOo We recommend at least on degree program that offers, to those in- 
terested, a general degree for any 130 hours completed.

Student Participation 

mPLEMENTATION Continued froM Issue 20 

The Implementation of the above principles is 
properly subject to innumerable local variations. 
On students themselves falls the difficult task 

iof assuring that the diversity of student inter- 
ests and opinions is; adequately represented. All 
individuals and groups at an institution should 
support the development of appropriate forms of 
jstudent participation by assuring that organiza- 
tions supporting to represent student interests 
possess a mandate from a clearly defined electo- 
rate, are accountable to that electorate, arid fulTo 
tlon through orderly procedures agreed upon 
through joint action by student and the other 
members of the academic community. Student rep- 
resentative, like other representatives in any 
area of university government, should be free to 
vote accordingto their best judgment. At all 
times, students should enjoy protection from the 
exercise of tyranny by a majority of a minority, 
the right to petition for and be granted an open 
hearing on a question of student rights or stu- 
dent participation, and the right of access--both 
to Information on Institutional government and to 
grievance procedures for complaints relating to 
their life in and out of the classroom. 

Limits on participation by student may be dic- 
tated in some instances, such as those In which a 
violation of law or of confidentiality might re- 
sult. Where any limitation exists, the student 
should have the right to challenge it in a man- 
ner consTstent with legality and the principles 
of academic freedom. All forms of participation 
in the government of the institution should be so 
devised as to preserve the academic freedom to 
which all groups are equally entitled. 

Student Involvement in institutional goveraimt 
may include membership-voting and nonvoting- on 
departmental committees, or on the university se- 
nate or any other principal legislative body and 
its committees. Where thay do not hold member- 
ship on these bodies, students should be able to 
place matters for action on their agendas and to 
receive a prompt report on the disposition of 
those matters. Student opinion should also be 
consulted, where feasible, in the selection of 
presidents, chief academic and nonacademic ad- 
ministrative officers including the dean of stu- 
dents, and faculty. Sometimes separate and para- 
llel student structures are desired in place of 
or in addition to mixed bodies. Where this is 
the case, care should be taken to guarantee that 
the student bodies not function, -mare Iv as sud- ^

groups enjoy meaningful channels of appeal. The

to du^y constituted instruments of student par-

POLLUTION TEACH-IN DAY 



This is a report compiled by the entire staff of the "Communicator". 



Earth Day was Wednesr 
day April 22, 1970 - — k 
but what Is today ? 
Betty Tonslng, Co-ordi- 
nating chairman of the 
Pollution Teach - In , 
seemed to wear that 
same question on her 
face as she introduced 
Mayor Harold Zeis. 

Zeis' s initial com- 
ment, "This is an am- 
bitious program," echo- 
ed in simple words what 
the Regional Campus 
students had done in 
cooperation with the 
faculties of both uni- 
versities. 

In the traditional 
political manner, Zeis 
explained that since 
his administration took 
office in 1961;, they 
have been concerned 
about it. The mayor 
readily pointed out 
the Three Rivers Pro- 
ject. This was a city 
project began in recent 
years to clean up the 
river banks and rivers. 

Before declaring the 
week of April 19 - 25 
Anti-Pollution Week , 
Zeis made note that 
auto - pollution in Pt« 
Wayne is second only to 
that of Los Angeles. 

Addressing the au- 
dience next was E)r« 
Gottlieb, Prof. of 
Biology. Gottlieb sta- 
ted in emphatic terms 
that man must strike a 
balance in the cycle of 

non-living living 

non living. Man, Dr, 
Gottlieb stated has 
created a hazard to fut- 



ure life on this planet 
in solid waste; soli d 
waste being plastics , 
glass, tin cans, ate, 
"In the future, the en- 
tire TJ.So will be a Los 
Angeles « . . .Our free-en- 
terprize system is the 
Urbanization and Indust- 
rllization have coupled 
with over-population to 
challenge man, and bring 
him to the brink of his 
death. 

"Pollution: A His- 
torical Perspective" was 
the topic of Dr. Dwight 
Henderson, Prof, offfis- 
tory. Henderson pointed 
out that pollution be- 
gan in this country in 
the 1800' s. The state of 
Virginia, he said, "be- 
gan pollution by expM- 
tation of virgin soil 
in planting tobacco yea* 
after year in the s'ame 
land, thereby depleting 
the soil of minerals &amp; 
leaving it stagnate ," 
During these years 
however, Henderson 
noted that man consid- 
ered land an unlimited 
resource on his new 
continent. But, he add- 
ed, a census taker in 
1890 confirmed the 

frontier has closed 

land was no longer un - 
limited. 

On the same topic. 
Dr. Louis Cantor re- 
marked, "even Buz Saw- 
yer has come out in 
favor of stopping pol- 
lution," '%en, he gave 
the floor over to a 



song written by Tom 
Lear. Lear*s song re- 
corded in one spot, 
"What you throw in the 
sink today, they drink 
in Sgn Jose tomorrow," 

Dr, Nigel Cook then 
began his discussion of 
"Private Cost vs. Soc- 
ial ^osto" Various 
quotes from Dr. Cook's 
talk illustrate what he 
had to say^ 

"The free enterprise 
system is the 

creator of pollution, 
so we must adopt it to 
stop it,,o,We must re- 
cycle waste into repro- 
duction,... We could 
virtually have zero GNP 
(Gross ■'•''ational Product! 
and be the wealthiest 
nation in the world., «« 
Today we produce shabby 
goods," 

Dr. ook concluded, 
"pollution can be stop- 
ped by a balanced pro- 
gram of taxation, sub- 
sidies, and laws," 



LEGAL ASPECTS OF POLLUTION 

The pollution program 
is about 10 years too 
late and Is now a criti- 
cal problem with short 
time left to solve it. 
This was a statement 
made by Senator Bloom 
during his talk on the 
legal aspects of pol- 
lution; specifically 
"State Legislation Hav- 
ing to do witn axi-. 
The Air Pollution Contrd 
Board was created in

1961, and have taken 
steps since then to halp 
get rid of air pollu- 
tion. They have said all 
open dumps should be 
closed down, and in 
Marion County put a 10 
mile fringe area of 
pollution control a- 
round Indianapolis to 
stop dumping outside 
the city. They are 
creating a quality Air 
Base in program, and have 
given more authority to 
county and state in the 
area of soil. 

The next speaker was 
Senator Gutman, who 
spoke on state legisla- 
tion and water pollution 
In I9I4-3 Indiana 
created the Stream Pol- 
lution Control Board, 
which is the primary a- 
gency concerned with 
water pollution in In- 
diana. This ^oard has 
among others the power 
to make rules, and have 
set down some clear and 
definite lines to go by 
as to what pollution is 
water is. There is also 
a Sewage program started 
to help clean up water 
pollution. 

The next speaker was 
Graham Richard, a Teach- 
er from Bishop Dwengeu 
He talked on the 1967 
Federal Aid Quality 
Control Act, He stated 
that Satisfactory Air 
Control could never be 
achieved unless we suc- 
ceeded in preventing 
Air Pollution before 
it occurred. He also 
said since the ai* 
doesn't otoservr' state 
boundaries, we need good 
interstate Government 
relations before we can 
have effective air 
control. The next 
speaker Hugh C.Kirtland 
Jr, talked about Court 



Action. He talked about 
the Individual citizen 
and what he could do to 
help fight pollution. He 
gave three ways that the 
individual cauld use to 
fight pollution on his 
property: Damage to 
ones property through 
nuisance by another 
party. Someone doing 
damage to a perron's 
propertyby trespassing, 
and damage to ones prop- 
erty through negligence 
by another party. 



GEORGE LOWE 



Mr, George Edward 
Lowe, who spoke between 
twelve thirty and one 
o'clock, is the execu- 
tive coordinator of the 
environmental education 
studies staff in the 
Department of Health, 
Education, and Welfare 
in Washington, D.C. 

Mr, Lowe first men- 
tioned four basic prob- 
lems facing oior world. 
Mass disruption (by 
thermal — nuclear war), 
pollution, overpopula- 
tion, and depletion of 
natural resources are 
looking us straight in 
the /"ace. 

Today there are pro- 
phets who are warning 

that the life giving 

systems are being 
threatened. They say 
it is time for us to 
become aware and to do 
something. The only 
thing we can d6 is 
change our life styles I 
Just as the Apollo 13 
astronauts were run- 
ning out of natxaral 
resources. We cannot 



afford to pollute what 
we do have, for even 

scientific thought 
cannot produce the 
life-giving resources. 
We need an intellectual 
synthesis between the 
hard sciences, soft 
sciences, and human- 
ities o 

We were warnea in 
191l\. by a vanishing 
species of passenger 
pigeons, who died 
because they were sens- 
itive to pollutants in 
our environment. It 
will not take long for 
Man to become sensitive 
to chemicals, deter- 
gents, etc. It will take 
only 10 to 15 years for 
these results of a 
"Convenient Society" 
to become deadlyl We 
are also warned by s 
dead Lake Erie and a 
dying Lake Michigan, 
Algae, which produce 
much of our oxygen is 
being killed. 

Mr. Lowe listed some 
ways in which we night 
change our life s tyles 
for the better. High 
horsepower cars, smo- 
king, and tin cans are 
three of today's life 
styles that must b.e 
changed. We could also 
flush toilets as little 
as possible, use non- 
colored toilet tissue 
so the colors won't 
break down, walk or 
bicycle whenever possi- 
ble, keep compost heaps, 
not use enzymes, not 
use pesticides, and 
plant trees to produce 
more oxygen. 

Now that we are sup- 
posedly aware of the 
hazards of pollution, 
we should all do some- 
thing to save our 
' ivesl

lU-PU COMMJNICATOR 



SENATOR VANCE HARTKE 

While listening to 
Senator Hartke's speech 
at the pollution teach- 
in, I was impressed 
with the idea of verbal 
pollutiono VerbAl pol- 
lution occurs when no- 
thing is done about an 
issue that is continu- 
ally talked about or 
debated. 

Senator Hartke 
brought to our atten- 
tion the concept we 
have of beinr immortalo 
Not one human being has 
left this earth alive — 
all men are destined to 
die. Now earth is 
dying. Lake M'^chigan Is 
dyinp;. Lake Frie is 
dead. Our rivers are 
outlets for waste. Our 
air is filled with poi- 
son. We owe alot to 
nature and all men 
should work toward pay- 
ing this debt, if this 
earth is to remain liv- 
able. For centuries we 
have been destroying 
this earth, but it was 
only a few months aj^o 
that we began to care 
and try and dosomething 
about our earthly envi- 
ronment. 

The fight against 
Dollution costs money. 
The corporations, insti- 
tutions , property owners 
and the general people 
are not willing to pay 
the price. For example 
the paper industry will 
have to spend 100 bill- 
ton dollars for the 
next ten years to come 
up to the standard set 
down for pollution con- 
trol. This would be a 
one third reduction in 
profit for the next ten 
years. People are not 
willing to accPT^'*" short 



term profits for long 
term gains. 

Most technology was 
made out of ignorance — 
we did not realize the 
harmful effects that 
synthetic detergents, 
radio fallout, or the 
automobile would create 
in our society. We all 
think that the idea of 
saving the world has no 
enemies o ^ut we find 
out day by day that 
there are many J)eople 
who are enemies of the 
world. 

Senator Hartke also 
stated that he acted on 
all the bills that 
would curb pollution. 
He is now in the pro- 
cess of inducing legis- 
Ifl tion to set up an Fn- 
vlronmental Impact 
Council in the White 
House. 



JAMES B. KESSLER 



James B. Kessler, 
Ph. D., Administration 
Assistant to the Gover- 
nor, spoke from 1:30 
to l:l\.S in order to 
present the policies 
sent forth by the admin- 
istration of Indiana 



and what the administra- 
tion is doing concerning 
pollution. 

In a statement to 
the President of the 
United States by the 
Governor of Indiana, 
states that pollu- 
tion is the product of 
culture and the inter- 
action of ecology. Most 
people pollute because 
it says to pollute. A 
man would usually go 
to a free junkyard be- 
fore he would go to one 
that charged* So he has 
been using the lakes 
and rivers as free 
junkyards although in 
the real sense they are 
not freeo The cost 
which will be untold 
billions, to counteract 
the effects of pollu- 
tion can and will be 
met through taxation. 
An incentive n&amp;t to pol- 
lute must be developed 
and it must be made un- 
profitable to pollute. 
The consximers would 
then pay the cost or 
not buy the product. 
The antipollution act- 
ivities must be coordi- 
nated.

LYMAN T. SAMMUEL 



"A voluntary busi- 
ness working for the 
bebternient of this com- 
munity," is the descrip- 
tion of the Chamber of 
Commerce given by the 
l:i-(5 Teach-in speaker, 
Mr. Lyman T. Samuel » 

Mr. Samuel, Director 
of Econogiic and Indus- 
trial Development for 
the Chamber of Commerce 
gave a short background 
of the Fort Wayne Com- 
merce and listed pro- 
jects it was involved 
in, including: 

,p;rowth activity, hu- 
man relations, educa- 
tion, legislature, air 
service, environmental 
control, and other 
types of transportation. 

He opened his talk 
to cover the city and 
pollution, "The cities 
are never standing 
still. They either grow 
or decline." "The 
smart thing to do,"' he 
went on, '^is to clamp 
down on industries that 
are causing havoc for 
all of us," 

The older plants^ 
are causing the general 
trouble of pollution," 
he said. He feelg, 
"The problem areas must 
be tackled in a sensi- 
ble manner," Today 
every new facility 
built must meet certain 
requirements for the 



prevention of pollution. 
This is one stop in the 
fig^ht against pollution. 
He concluded by say- 
ing, "To date, people — 
you and I — haven't 
been enough concerned 
about pollution. It 
takes tax dollars to 
combat it and people 
always scream about 
taxes," Could this be 
one of the prices we'll 
have to pay? 



DAN MANION 

Dan Manlon, the Dir- 
ector of Industrial De- 
velopment from t he In- 
diana State Commerce 
Department, spoke at 
2 pemo He suggested 
that the solution to 
the nation's immense 
waste problem lies not 
in destroying free en- 
terprise, a major con- 
tributor, but by em- 
ploying it to ' help 
solve the problem. He 
also pointed out that a 
strong individual efi- 
fort on the part of 
both organized groups 
and individuals was 
needed to combat pol- 
lution effectively* 



CONSERVATION 

The first speaker 
for the conservation 
part of the Pollution 
Teach-in was Clifford 
H, Scott. He discussed 
the history of conser- 
vation from 1870 to 
1930. He told of some 
of the organizations 
that marked early ef- 
forts in trying to get 
a conservation program 
started. He said there 
are three major types 
of groups they are: 



scientific, the econ- 
omic Interest groups, 
and the urban middle 
and upper middle class 
organizations. He end- 
ed up with a very signi- 
ficant statement, reme- 
meber the past we can't 
afford to repeat it. 

The next speaker was 
Thomas F. Dust in, he 
talked about what we 
should do now. He 
stated that you and we 
have real power to bring 
about significant 
changes and that we 
would have to help ind- 
ustry clean up the mess 
they perpetuated. He 
also said it matters 
not where we have been, 
but where we are going 
and that this is the 
Most serious battle 
mankind has ever under- 
taken. 

The next speaker, 
Gl«mi Lehker talked on 
pestisides and the en- 
vironment. He said 
pestisides were used 
in the past but then 
here was nothing else 
to use. Now fS% of all 
funds being spent to- 
day on insect control 
research are bejng spent 
on non-chemicle pro- 
cedures . 

The next three 
speakers, George H. 
Kennedy, David C« Kile 
and To Daniel McCain 
showed slides to show 
■how the land, animals, 
and plants were being 
affected by pollution. 



E. ROSS ADAIR 



Eo Ross Adair^ U.S, 
Representative, began 
his l+:00p,m. Teach-in 
speech with a storyo 
It seems a man was won-

dering through the 
woods and came UDi?j]L_ja. 
stream* There was clear 
water, fresh air, and 
green grass. After wan- 
dering for quite awhile 
he came to a point 
where the creek became 
a river and noted the 
•»assy bubbles in it, 
the oil on the surface, 
old tires and other 
debris strewn aroiondo 
".nank goodness I've 
found civilization at 
last," he stated. 

This story points 
out the growing misery 
of this land of ours, 
Mr, Adair says he is 
dedicated to the pro- 
position to turn the 
story about so that man 
could think that clean 
water went alont with 
civilization. 

Continuing on, Mr, 
Adair said, **Time, In 
this instance. Is very 
much an essence. We' 
have to act promptly 
correctly on our envi- 
ronments 

He said we smell, 
taste, and see the en- 
vironment* With the en- 
vironment we have a 
personal experience and 
personal frustration* 
He felt that by this 
gathering here at the 
campus and at other 
places, people were 
ready to do something. 



SOLID WASTE 



The Solid Waste por- 
tion of the Environmen- 
tal Teach-:i-in opened 
with a film, which 
pointed out the magni- 
tude of tho solid waste 
problem and the possible 



solutions, scree of which 
are presently operative. 
Following the film, 
there were four featur- 
ed speakers; James J. 
Tobolski, Assistant 
Professor of Biology, 
Ralpf Dunn, Allen County 
Sanitation Engineer, 
•State Senator John Aug- 
sburger. As well as 
three discussants; Har- 
ry Curtis, Robert Dah- 
ment and Ted Habercorn, 
Each participant spoke 
about the problem of 
solid waste in relation 
to his particular posi- 
tion. Each was in 
agreement that we must 
clearly define the 
problem so that we 
knote; how to go about 
settini^ out goals. The 
steps to be taken in 
solving were eentered 
in the areas of salvag- 
ing as much of the 
waste as possible and 
sanitary land fill pro- 
posals for waste that 
has no retainment value, 
letting into more speci- 
fic areas, the partici- 
pants discussed legal 
means as well as hin- 
deranced to solving the 
problem . The program 
was terminated with an 
exchange among a few of 
the gentlemen concern- 
ing the expense of cer- 
tain proposals. 



WATER 

The discussion of 
Water Pollution was op- 
ened by chairman Will- 
iam H. T~&gt;avies, Associ- 
ate Professor of Biol- 
ogy, Dr, Davies, in 
his s-ieech, tried to 
pinpoint the definition 
of pollution, but con- 
cluded that "like beau- 
ty, it is in the eyes 



of the beholder, , opol- 
lution is relevant," 
He cited three major 
sources of water pollu- 
tion: cultural, ai:ri- 
cultural, and industri- 
al activities, Dr, Dav- 
ies quoted statistics 
that predict by 1990 
90^ of the domestic 
waste, 80;^ of the in- 
dustrial waste, and S0% 
©f the agricultural 
waste will be trans- 
ported by water. 

The first speaker 
introduced by Dr, Da- 
vies was Roniald L. Bo- 
nar. Chief Sewer Engi- 
neer SDoke about Port 
Wavne Pollution Water 
Control Programs, Nr, 
Ponar said that some- 
thing is belnp; done a- 
bout the pollution prob- 
lem in Fort Wayne, but 
not as much as should 
be done. He Isolated 
municipal waste as the 
most prevalent problem 
Mr, Bonar stated that 
"Fort Wayne is both a 
consumer and contributor 
of water pollution," 
He divided the Port 
Wayne water pollution 
problem into three cat- 
agories: 1. sewage 
treatment plants. 2, 
small sewage systems 
operating with low ef- 
ficiency, 3» combined 
sewage overflows from 
the more densely pop- 
ula ted areas of Port 
Wayne, At the present 
there is a #10 million 
program being imple- 
mented; however, Mr, 
Ponar believes 1^66 mil- 
lion will be needed In 
the 70' s in order to 
completely "curb water 
pollution. Water pol- 
lution programs have 
been"ser iouslv crippled" 
according to Mr, Bonar, 
by lack of otai^c 



lU-PTJ flQm^ TmTnATnR

funds which are needed 
to utilize the fsSrail- 
llon federal grant 
which was received,, Be- 
cause of this lack of 
funds, Mr. Bonar pre- 
dicted a rise in t^e 
comparltlvely low sew- 
age rates of Fort Wayne; 

fir. Philip Schnelker, 
Consulting Sanitary En- 
gineer, was the next 
speaker who spoke on 
the problem of water 
pollution. Mr. Schnel- 
ker stressed the need 
for technical people in 
the field of pollution 
since it is now lacking 
this aspect. 

Mr. Orel Hirt from 
the Indiana State Board 
of Health briefly des- 
cribed the strijctiirR 
and duties of the Board 
of Health and pointed 
out the great burden of 
work which it bears. 
There are 2^0 municipal- 
ities with treatment 
plants, over 800 indus- 
tries with waste to be 
treated, and 3fOOO semi- 
public sewage plants 
serving schools andno- 
bile home olants. How- 
ever, there are only 
20 men who ere in admin- 
istrative control of 
them. This Illustrates 
the gross shortage In 
the fleid of Water Pol- 
lutlono 



AIR 



At the 7:00 session 
of the Environmental 
Teach-Tn, the subject 
under discussion was 
Air Pollution. Eight 
different speakers spoke 
on this problem. 

The first speaker was 
Dr. Arlo Kaiser, Assis - 
tant Health officer o f 



jFt. Wayne. Dr. Kaiser 
Spoke on "The Air of Pt. 
iWayne." He first pT?e - 
isented a resume of th e 
pollution problems of 
Ft. Wayne. Among these 
were: the Internal com- 
bustion engine. He sta- 
ted that Ft. Wayne has 
the third highest no. 
of autos per caoita In 
'the Unite d Sta tes; 
power production; pol- 
lution emission from 
industry and business; 
Structural heat in g 
units; and open burnlngo 

Dr. Kaiser then 
listed several ways in 
which the common citizen 
can help in the fight 
against pollution. Some 
of these were: 1. Be - 
come informed on t he 
current pollution prob - 
lem, ?. Support 'lovem- 
ment controls over pol - 
lutlon, 3. Encourage 
legislation backing the 
anti-pollution movement, 
il-. Be certain that your 
actions don't contribute 
to pollution. 

The next speaker. Dr. 
Harrer, a lung special - 
ist, spoke on the af- 
fects of air pollution 
on chronic lung diseas- 
es, centering his dis- 
cussion around pulma- 
nory emphysema and Chro- 
nic Bronchitis. He- 
stated that over two 
million people in this 
country suffer from one 
or the other or both. 
This Is over ten per 
cent of the popula tl on. 

Both are more preva- 
lant that TP pnd Lung 
Cance^^ combined H e 
said thab air pollution, 
like smoking increases 
'one's susceptibility to 
either disease. 

The third speaker 
was Mr. John Ossberger, 
State Senator, Chaii^nan 



of State Subcommittee 
on Health, Education, 
and Welfare. Mr. Oss- 
berger spoke on the 
State Pollutiori Control 
Board and listed a few 
of the measures taken 
by the boerd to try to 
stop pollution. 

The next speaker was 
Dr, Tiottlieb, professor 
of biology at this cam- 
pus. He spoke for a 
time about the history 
of air pollution. He 
then discussed modern 
air pollution itself 
and the various methods 
of getting rid of it 
He stated that the costs 
were high, but "The 
costs be damned, life 
is more important*" Fe 
said that down through 
history safety has been 
sacrificed for some 
savings at that tisx^o 
But, it is going to 
cost more to get rid of 
air pollution than it 
would have cost to pre- 
vent it In the fii'st 
place. 

The fifth speaker, 
Mr, Melvin Kurtis, 
listed what he consi- 
dered the three greatest 
causes of pollution; 
Industrial smoke, cars 
and busses, and popula- 
tion. He said that 
cars and busses are re- 
sponsible for about c., I 
of the pollution in t he 
cities. He also sta- 
ted that there was 
speculation that the 
last ice age was brought 
on as a result of the 
volcanos pollution of 
the a ir. He said that 
if air pollution contin- 
ues at the current rate 
that there might be an- 
other ice age by the 
year 2,000. 

The next speaker, 
Colbert J. Pox, listed 



20 



"four possibilities for 
curbing the growth of 
pollution. These were: 
1, Industry must real- 
ize their social func- 
tion, 2, Technology 
must be developed to 
fight against pollution, 
3, nfovernment must 
change the allocation 
of resources, [|., All 
people must "look down 
the pike" to see what 
problems might be gen- 
erated by what we're 
doing nowo 

The next speaker was 
Mr. Jack Shiber, a rep- 
resentative of Inter 
national Harvester of 
Ft. Wayne. Mr. Shiber 
aaid that TH had been a 
leader of the APA(Amer- 
Ican Foundry Association 
since its beginning. He 
said that recently IH 
has converted thcee of 
its boilers from coal to 
a combination of gas or 
fuel oil. He also said 
that IH plans to build a 
one million dollar ex- 
haust emission control 
lab here in Ft. Wayne. 

The last speaker of 
this session was a re 
resentative of the APS 
American Foundrymans 
Society)Hhich was escab 
llshed in 1935. He spoke 
about the anti-polluti 
measures that are being 
taken by the foundries 



"It's one heck of a 
program that finally 
meets a University's 
standards", concluded 
Dr. Gottlieb after the 
Earth Day program.

FRIJID PINK AND BOX TOPS: 



FIRDAY NIGHT 



The "Prijld Pink," 
I described by the young 
'set as among the lead- 
ing apostles of hard 
^rock and high energy, 
'originated three years 
I a go in Detroit. 

After a series of 
[successful appearances 
in the Detroit area, 
the group's first real 
1 chance came when they 
[Were backing a London 
(Records artist in De- 
troit on a personal ap- 
,pearance. An executive 
of the recording com- 
pany was there at the 
I engagement and was so 
impressed with their 
sound that he had the 
group submit some tapes 

'which they had produced 
themselves. Eventually, 

'London signed the group 
and released "Tell Me 
Why", which was one of 
the original tapes. It 
immediately sold 25,000 
copies In the Detroit 
area and it was then 
London realized the po- 
tential of the group 
and asked them to d o an 
entire albtim. 

Their next big hit 
was "House of the Ri- 
sing Sun" which was 
first used as part of 
the album and then la- 
ter turned into a sing- 
le which won the hearts 
of DJ's around the cotu&gt; 
try. 

The "Frijid Pink's" 
soxond is created by 
four guys who take thel* 
music very seriously;

volved in the music that 
surrounds him. His 
talents extend to both 
harmonica and drums. 

Gary Thompson, lead 
guitarist, had been 
playing with jazz ori- 
ented groups for eight 
years before joining 
"Prijld Pink." One of 
his distinctive features 
Is his wallling, bluesy 
lead, and rhythm back- 
ing. 

Satch Harris played 
rhythm guitar before 
idlscoverlng the bass. 
^He is now an Indispen- 
islble element of the 
'group and sets the pat- 
tern for the rhythm 
section since there is 
only a lead guitar, 
bass and drums accom- 
panying Kelly's voice o 

Rick Stevers has 
been playing drums for 
12 years with various 
groups. He sings back- 
up vocal harmonies and 
one of the highlights 
of the group's perfc
