The current recession 
has encouraged many 
individuals to seek high- 
er education around the 
country. IPFW mirrors 
this recent trend, which 
may create some head- 
ache for students, facul- 
ty, and stair. 

IPFW has a ten per- 
cent increase in enroll- 
ment for the Fall 2009 
semester. During the 
first few weeks of 
school, one can expect 
long lines from the 
offices of Financial Aid. 
Admissions, the Bursar's, 
and from the book store. 
It is also likely that it will 
take much longer than 
usual to find a parking 
space. 

After the first three 
weeks of school, the 
ten percent increase is 
more than likely going 
to decrease when some 
students decide they will 
not be able to complete 
die semester. 

"Obviously that 
number |ten percent] is 
expected to decrease to 
around five to ten per- 
cent," Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs George 



McClellan said, "but 
we're expecting the num- 
ber to stay closer to ten 
percent." 

This increase in 
enrollment is mostly 
good news for IPFW 
but it is not good news 
for those who want to 
get into the classes they 
need to graduate, want 
to get information in a 
timely manner, or need a 
parking spot. 

"Anytimeyou increase 
the student body, there 
will be implications," 
McClellan said. Some 
of these implications 
include having enough 
basic English, math- 
ematics, and communi- 
cation classes available 
to incoming freshman. 
As a result more sec- 
tions have been added 
to these classes and 
seating capacities have 
been increased, despite 
no pay raise to faculty 
or. staff due to this year's 
budget deficit. 

Parking can perhaps 
be alleviated by a new 
Citilink service called 
CampusLink "will make 
it much easier for stu- 
dents, teachers and the 
public to get around the 
IPFW and Ivy Tech cam- 
puses as well as nearby 



shopping and hous- 
ing areas" according to 
http://www.fwcitilink. 
com/campuslink/. 

This shuttle service 
would not just benefit 
the current parking situ- 
ation by keeping more 
cars off of campus, but 
it can also help students 
save more money on gas 
and reduce their carbon 
foot print. A monthly 
pass would typically cost 
S45, but for the first year 
of the program a student 
can get a discounted 
pass at nine dollars. 

Public transporta- 
tion is also much more 
environmentally sound, 
as one bus can remove 
dozens of vehicles from 
the road at a given time. 

There is yet to be any 
remedy for the long lines 
one may encounter dur- 
ing the first few days of 
classes. In an effort to 
perhaps alleviate some 
of the tension for those 
standing in lines, donuts 
and soft drinks will be 
available around Kettler 
Hall between Aug. 24 and 
27. 

"I think when you see 
this kind of increase at 
a university, there is so 
much positive poten- 
tial," McClellan said.

We used to be called 
Indiana- Purdue Exten- 
sion. We used to have a 
logo that was the shape 
of the state of Indiana. 
We used to put our sports 
teams in red and gold 
jerseys. 

But the student news- 
paper at IPFW was al- 
ways calledThe Commu- 
nicator, alway s printed 
every school year, and al- 
ways provided the cam- 
pus with information, 
conversation starters. 
and a vehicle to reach the 
campus community. 
THE PAPER 

In late summer, 1969, 
the IPFW administra- 
tion and 1PSGA looked 
through new student ap- 
plications and contacted 
incoming freshmen who 
had been active in sports, 
student government, de- 
bate team, etc... They in- 
vited the group to spend 
a weekend at 'camp' with 
current college students 
to talk about making 
IPFW more than just a 
classroom experience. 
Our goal was to come up 
with ways to begin sports 
on campus, develop 
more student clubs and 
organizations, and pos- 
sibly create a student 
newspaper. 

A sophomore IPFW 
student, Steve Hud- 
dleston, connected with 
me at camp and said, 
"We need to start a stu- 
dent newspaper." So we 
did. We started classes 
the fall of 1969 and start- 
ed The Communicator. 



THE NAME 

"The beginning of 
wisdom is to call things 
by their right names." 
goes a Chinese Proverb. 
The name "The Com- 
municator" was all Hud- 
dleston's idea. He had 
seen a movie that ended 
with the line. "The Com- 
municator". Sadly no 
one seems to recall what 
movie it was. But the 
name stuck in spite of 
later editors and publish- 
ers kicking around name 
changes. 
BACK IN THE DAY 

In 1969 we used a 
machine called a Veri- 
typer that, as we typed 
our newspaper stories, 
put it automatically into 
columns. We then cut 
the columns, ran the 
paper through a 'waxer', 
and laid each newspaper 
page out by hand every 
Wednesday night. 

We put the laid out 
pages in a box and ran it 
down to the Greyhound 
bus station. The pages 
traveled to Angola where 
our printer picked it up, 
printed it, and sent the 
newspapers back to us 
by bus. We'd pick up the 
bundles and put them in 
newsstands around cam- 
pus. Sometimes we'd 
miss the bus and one of 
us would have to drive 
'all the way' to Angola 
(speed limits were lower 
back then). 

The newspaper lay- 
ing out process was very 
time consuming and of- 
ten the staff would end 
up leaving campus to go 
home at dawn or spend- 
ing the night on campus, 
falling asleep on the floor 
or tables as each per: 



page was completed. 
ALL THE NEWS 
THAT'S FIT TO 
PRINT 

lust like today's Com- 
municator, the early 
version had news and 
features about campus 
events and organiza- 
tions, updates on our 
newly formed sports 
teams and sports clubs, 
and a fair share of advei- 
tising to help us stay in 
business. 

We did a few editori 
als, including what we 
thought was a funny Q&amp;A 
column. Most of the 
questions we received 
were given the same an- 
swer, "Please go to Helen 
Waite." We thought we 
were hysterical. 
TODAY 

Over the years, [he 
newspaper had several 
editors-in-chief who 
went on to careers in 
writing, marketing, and 
public relations. A few 
even tried their hand at 
writing for weekly and 
daily newspapers. The 
one thing the editors 
all had in common was 
they cut their journalistic 
teeth at The Communi- 

Forty years later, The 
Communicator remains 
a solid constant on a 
campus that is constant- 
ly evolving and changing. 
Change is good, but his- 
tory and stability make a 
strong foundation. 

One thing we never 
did figure out though... 
what was the name of 
that movie which ended 
with the words, "The 
Communicator"?

THE GREEN PAGES 



Green Ribbon Commission 

The not-so-green fruits of our resolution 



By now you have probably noticed 
the multitude of products branded 
with labels promising green and 
natural ingredients. You might be hard- 
pressed to find a grocery store without 
an organic section, and sustainable 
living Is no longer an alternative hippie 
lifestyle, but an important life skill. It 
does seem as though the phrase "going 
green" has become a marketing tool, 
but beyond the barrage of quick tips 
and fun facts lies a serious problem. 
We have been confronted with the 
gravity of our diminishing natural 
resources and we now know that a step 
in the right direction means more than 
flipping the switch when you exit the 
room. Although the impending crisis 
is far-reaching, only recently has it 
entered into mainstream politics. 

On a local level, energy conservation 
from the standpoint of reforming 
a "backbone for an aggressive City 
energy policy," involves the use of 
alternative transportation, changes 
in land developmental patterns, 
renewing energy resources, shifting 
city opera tions, lesseningconsumption 
of energy by buildings and people, 
as well as improving air quality and 
overall health. These were the issues 
facing members of the Green Ribbon 
Commission when appointed by Mayor 
Graham Richard in March of 2006. 
Charged with the taskof recommending 
policy changes, providing community 
awareness and supporting a city-wide 
reduction in energy use, the Green 
Ribbon Commission (GRC) submitted 
its final report as the result of a four- 
month effort on September 29, 2006. 
The details of the report included well- 
defined goals and guidelines outlining 
how-Fort Wayne... can reduce demand 



for imported oil and natural gas and 
electricity while keeping money here 
in our local economy, creating jobs 
and improving the quality of life." An 
important feature of the Commission 
was the Energy Policy signed by Mayor 
Richards in January, 2007. 

The Summary of Findings and 
resolution for improvements to our 
area were ambitious and presented 
as a sort of "best of all worlds." as 
explained by David Van Gilder who 
was appointed and served for the 
Commission. Mr. Van Gilder is a 
local lawyer and also President for 
Acres Land Trust Inc.When asked if 
he felt the goals of the Green Ribbon 
Commission had been achieved, his 
forthright response was, "No, they 
really haven't." Although he did note 
that planning and implementation for 
such a comprehensive undertaking 
was meant to be "longer term." This 
long-term mission would obviously 
span the course of several City Council 
Members and no doubt be a continuous 
effort on the part of each new city 
administration. Nonetheless, priorities 
fluctuated as a common occurence that 
has resulted in seemingly less attention 
and resources devoted to the cause by 
Mayor Henry's administration than 
under the direction of Mayor Richards. 

Van Gilder does point out the 
more tangible accomplishments such 
as the use of several hybrid vehicles 
among the city fleet, the establishment 
of a three-block bike lane, as well 
as the mixed use development and 
renovation efforts of older buildings 
in the downtown area. There are still 
improvements, he asserts, that could 
use some attention including an overall 
increase in construction practices 
for green build Lng.To date, it is not so 
much the issue of living green in Fort 
Wayne degenerating either by lack 
of funding or by a shift in matter of

precedence — in Van Gilder's words, "It 
just needs some cheerleading." 

Current director of Energy and 
Environmental Services, Wendy 
Barrott, agrees:We have not met all 
the challenges, but things are getting 
better. Her department is helping 
to educate and implement effective 
energy practices. By accessing 
cityoffortwayne.org and locating the 
Energy and Environmental Services 
tab, members of the community will 



find a wealth of valuable energy-saving 
resources as well as a link for a Free 
subscription to the Green City monthly 
newsletter. 

The issue of promoting healthy 
energy use must have strong support 
on a local level, and yes, it does start 
with a flip of the switch and the well- 
worn reminder to "Go Green" but it 
continues with our daily efforts as local 
and global citizens to remain truly 
committed to such an important cause.

range from memory loss to birth defects. 

According to www.haenow.org, buying one 
organic t-shirt can save 4 ounces of this pesticide 
from entering our environment, which in turn aids 
in the earth's fight against global warming. Not only 
does this way of growing cotton save on pesticides, 
but also on emissions from machinery normally used 
in the growing process. Much of the work is done by 
hand, which lessens the use of fuel for the machines. 
Vet another benefit of organic cotton is the quality. 
Better health from farmers and the cotton itself 
leads to a high quality product that is made into a 
high quality piece of clothing. Add this together with 
how you will feel on the inside for helping the earth, 
and the slightly higher cost of buying organic will be 
worth it. 

So next time you go shopping for some beauty 
products and clothing, look up some stores that sell 
organic clothing ahead of time and see what the hype 
is all about if you get hungry while you are out, stop 
by Fresh Market or the Health Food Shoppe of Fort 
Wayne and try some organically grown fruits and 
vegetables. If you are going to go organic, you might as 
well go in every direction when possible. Remember, 
big changes come from small movements.

STUDENT ISSUE! 



Parking poses challenges 

Student Services and Library Complex construction will add to congestion 



By Peter Schnellenberger

shoppers when it comes 
to finding a place to park.

ing to Walt Branson Vice 
Chancellor of Financial 
Affairs there are a total of 
4823 parking spaces this 
year, which is a 170 space 
increase from last year's 
4653, 

Of these new spaces, 
3907 are considered "B"

in white that are open 
to students and visitors) 
while 661 are "A" (spaces 
outlined in green which, 
are open only to staff and

only 3801 "B" and 628 "A"

By Annie Robinson 

lobiamOJeiplwedu 



While starting the Tall 
Icrm at a new school is a 
nightmare for many stu- 
dents, "Freshmen Fest" 
at IPFW's main campus 
offers plenty of exciting 
activities for incoming 
freshman as they prepare 
for their first college ex- 
perience. Activities such 
as Euchre tournaments 
and an "Amazing Race" 
helped the students in- 
teract with other incom- 
ing freshmen. From the 
ID pickup to the cook- 
out, students were en- 
couraged to get involved 
in many organizations, 
clubs, and activities. "Ev- 
erything from anthro- 
pology to rugby club was 
there and had a booth." 
said freshman Therrin 
Eber. "They all had a lot 
of information about 
their club and there were 
so many different things 
to get involved in. There 
was something for every- 



body." 

The familiar mixture 
of fear and confusion 
that so often accompa- 
nies a new experience 
was quickly erased from 
almost all faces. The 
overwhelming feeling 
seemed to disappear for 
many as they found that 
particular booth that in- 
terested them, and made 
them feel more connect- 
ed to their future school. 
The general atmosphere 
was quite relaxed and 
"come and go." While the 
booths offered several 
opportunities for stu- 
dents to get involved, the

"1 am not a motiva-

said. "I am a public

Spirituality at IPFW 



By Kassi Galbreath 

gjlbt r0 1 0il ud» nl \ i plvird u 

The transition 
from high school to col- 
lege can be lackluster if 
students do not reach 
out and get involved 
outside of the classroom. 
IPFW caters to a wide 
range of students, offer- 
ing a long list of diverse 
clubs and organizations 
to gel plugged into. 

Among the 

groups is Campus Minis- 
try, a religious group for 
students who want to de- 
velop and/or strengthen 
their personal relation- 
ship with God. 

"Spiritual matu- 
rity is just one compo- 
nent of being a healthy 
person," said Campus 
Ministry director Ben 
Gales. "At Campus Min- 
istry, we nurture that as- 
pect of personal growth." 
Students can take 
part in "conversations- 
meetings, which occur 
Wednesday evenings at 
7:00 pm in the Walb Ball- 
room. At these meetings, 
students break off into 



small groups where they 
discuss topics relevant to 
college life. Each small 
group is led by one of the 
13 Campus Ministry stu- 
dent leaders. 

According to Gates, 
the goal of these meet- 
ings is for students to 
have conversations 

about God and the Bible 
with fellow students and 
also to encourage each 
student to have personal 
conversations with God 
on a regular basis. Ap- 
proximately 100-150 stu- 
dents gather in the ball- 
room for "conversations" 
night each week. 

Other Campus Min- 
istry events students can 
join include a mission 
trip to Northern Ireland 
in March 2010 as well 
as a summer trip to In- 
dia (also 2010), a fall re- 
treat in October, small 
group Bible studies, and 
monthly service projects. 

"I want to encourage 
all students to come to a 
Campus Ministry event," 
said Gates. "They are a 
lot of fun, and we would 
love to see you."

Campus Ministry events,

istry website at http://

site at http://myw.ipfw.

IPFW also offers sev- 
eral club sports for stu- 
dents to partake in. For 
those students who are 
interested in learning 
more about yoga and 
refining their yoga prac- 
tice, the Yoga Club is 
open to anyone who fills 
out an IPFW waiver and 
club membership form. 

"Our desire is to share 
our love for yoga and 
various forms of move- 
ment, spiritual growth 
and bodywork with 
IPFW students and our 
community," said Club 
Treasurer Katie Bailey. 
"We believe that the yo- 
gic journey is best when 
traveled with others." 

The Yoga Club has 
two different weekly 
meetings — a meeting to 
discuss yoga and yoga- 
related topics, which 
is free of charge, and a

(500) Days of 
Summer is a new film star- 
ring Joseph Gordon-Levin 
and Zoocy Dcschanel, who 
is the world's second most 
perfect woman, next to Jes- 
sica Alba. It is a story of boy 
meets girl, but ihcy make it 
clear in the beginning that 
it is not a love story. What 
is possibly one of the most 
unique films thai 1 have ever 
seen accomplishes some- 
thing much more meaning- 
ful than a simple talc of ro- 
mance. Bouncing back and 
forth from fantasy to reality. 
the movie gives us a look 
into Tom's, the lead char- 
acter, expectations and the 
inevitable let downs. Zooey 
Dcschancl, who plays Sum- 
mer, does a great job in 
what I think is her best role 
to date. The woman is really 
blessed. She can sing, she 
can act, she is gorgeous, 
and it is always fun trying 
to pronounce her last name. 
The story is so unique in ils 
honesty and awareness of 
modem day relationships. 
Without giving too much 
away, many people have 



been in the exact same po- 
sition as Tom and Summer. 
The boy who holds onto the 
possibility of love like he 
will never be happy without 
it, and the girl who has only 
c fail. It is defi- 



nitely a pan of my "Movies 
that will Save die World" 
category. So go out and see 
it: spend your last few days 
of summer on something 
worthwhile, at least until 
autumn comes around.

'Be Unapologetically You' 

Musician K'naan spreads life messages on album, at Indiana tour stop 



By Dan Vance 

d.in u:in«:.. lHi1m.nl "i"i 



Born in a district known as "The River of Blood," 
musician K'naan has seen and survived things that 
most people can't even conjure up in their deepest 
imagination. Through these trials and tribulations, 
including escaping Somalia on the last commercial 
flight from the country before its biggest fall, he has 
been able to put his life in the public eye, in part 
thanks to his Z009 release 'Troubadour.' 

"I made my music to help me live through it. And 
this is way before I thought that my music could 
have an audience or could have any sort of success." 
K'naan says. "It was just for me, so it's a huge thing 
that shaped my life experiences and therefore my 
music is my life, my sound." 

Music was such an integral part of his life. 
especially once he moved from his birth place, that 
K'naan learned much of his early English from rap 
music. Not only did it give him the tools he needed to 
communicate in society, it furthered his own artistic 
endeavors. 

"The learning process is not just one way, not 
everyone learns from a book," K'naan points out. 

After leaving Mogadishu and spending some time 
in New York, K'naan's family moved on to Canada 
where he made a home as part of the large Somali 
community in Toronto. Through his early work at 
open mic events, K'naan met promoter Sol Guy, who 
helped book a speaking engagement in front of the 
United Nations' High Commissioner for Refugees. 
The engagement opened up the doors for K'naan 

"The learning process is not 

just one way, not everyone 

learns from a book," K'naan 

points out. 

to get his message spread and started a successful 
run with Sol, who still acts as a producer and road 
manager for K'naan today. 

Since that performance in 1999, K'naan has 
traveled a lot, releasing his debut "The Dusty Foot 
Philosopher'' in 2005 and seeing fans take interest 
from all parts of the globe, including Australia, India 
and America. For K'naan however, it wasn't about 
the fanfare, but about the ability to make his art and 
spread his message. 

"The truth is that you make art with or without 
fans. Fans aren't compulsory for art making," he 
notes. 

"People who haven't had my experiences or really 
strong experiences can't be a certain way. They don't 
know to be grateful, so it is natural for them to deal 
with the mundane and complain. But when you have 
been through things, you appreciate and you tend to 
put out positivity because of it." 

K'naan showcased that positivity and his artistic 
talents last week at the Indiana State Fair Grounds 
as an opening act on the lason Mraz Gratitude Cafe" 
Tour. 

Performing an undeniable mix of straight album 
cuts, acoustic versions and even slowing the song 
'Somalia' down into a piece of mild slam-poetry, the 
Somali bom musician captivated the crowd. The 
same crowd that had grown from silent when he 
began his set to happily singing along with 'Waviri 
Flag' to end the performance. 

The crowd, a vast majority of whom were at the 
Fair Grounds specifically for Mraz, got a strong dose 
of discovery with K'naan's set that included the 
acoustic version of 'Take a Minute' and the Adam 
Levine co-written. 'Bang Bang.' 

"That is most of my whole thing is people who 
are discovering my music," says K'naan, who before 
joining the Mraz tour, was out as an opening artist for 
rapper Nas performing in front of an entirely different 
type of crowd. Earlier in 2009. he performed as pan of

K'naan: Hip-hop artist, K'naan, performing his hit single "Wavin' Flag" at the Indianapolis state fair grounds 



the well-known South by Southwest (SXSW) event. 

Through these experiences with vastly different 
artists, K'naan has come up with a simple, yet 
poignant plan for himself and advice for aspiring 
musicians and artists. 

"Be unapologetically you," he says. "We don't want 
another guy that we already know or another girl that 
we've already heard, it doesn't matter." 

As for K'naan himself, he is still looking to find 
more of a niche. While 'Troubadour' is selling well (it 
debuted at #32 on the Billboard Top 200 initially), and 
receiving critical acclaim from the New York Times 



and Blender magazine, among other publications, 
he is pushing forward. RecenUy, he released a three- 
song sample EP with JPeriod called The Messengers.' 
The duo will release a full length Messengers cut later 
this year. For him, it is just another step into getting 
close to where he wants with his music. 

"Whenever you write something new, you always 
kind of favor that for a moment and then you keep 
going," he says. "The truth is that I just don't feel that 
I've reached my peak, I probably won't ever. But lam 
certainly not close to feeling like 1 have my favorite 
things about my music yet-"

Gates Center Construction.

gerijRKOIOIpFwtdu 

On August 28th as 
the Lady Volleydons 
claim the court for the 
first time this season, 
the IPFW fans will be not 
be lined up at the nor- 
mal entrance but will be 
forced to access the gym 
and tickets through the 
fitness entrance that is 
near the normal enter- 
ence, but to the left of 
the building. Because 
of the construction to 
improve the campus, 
the ticket box office and 
front doors to Gates 
sports center is no lon- 
ger there. 

"I guess with the con- 
struction it is going to 
be a little challenging to 
run events here at the 
gates center for the next 
three years because that 
is the time frame for 
when everything is go- 
ing to be done. With the 
new student services 
building being built and 
we will have the connec- 
tion between that and 
the Library, it is going 
to be challenging but

doable." said sports in- 
formation director Rudy 
Yovich. "Ticketing will 
be done out in the lobby 
of Gates now, since they 
have torn the front of 
the building off, there is 
no ticket area anymore, 



and we will adapt. That is 
what we have done ever 
since I started here." 

As far as the construc- 
tion goes, when the proj- 
ect is complete, Gates 
- along with the Helmke 
Library and Walb Stu- 



dent Union — will have 
a whole new look. The 
building will be the Stu- 
dents Services Complex 
Building and will house 
a competition 200 me- 
ter track, a pole vault 
area, jumping pits, a 
stripe for hurtle and oth- 
er things to help allow us 
to improve not only our 
track team but the rest 
of the IPFW athletics. 
This facility will also per- 
mit IPFW to hold NCAA 
qualifying meets right 
here on campus. 

Along with the ben- 
efits to the track program 
we will also be adding a 
new weight room to the 
front of the building with 
a room for cardio and 
new weight equipment. 
The second floor of the 
building will house all 
the new offices for the 
coaching staff here at 
IPFW, and other small 
updates will be made 
around Gates to help 
with the aging of the 
building. 

"Overall it is going to 
be a deep benefit to ath- 
letics and the university," 
said Athletic Director 
Tommy Bell.
