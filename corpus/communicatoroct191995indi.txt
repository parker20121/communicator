'Dynamic professor' to leave university 



Students, faculty support instructor 



Department of Arts and 
Sciences reduces staff due 
to lack of funds. 

by Eric Ledhctler 
Copy I 'lii' 'i 

Rheba Knot, an African American, part* lime 
instructor Tor political science, women's studies and 
history, has decided she will no longer continue her 
position .it this university. 

"1 did have to make a very hard decision, and that 
was to decline the offers to leach part-time next semes- 
ter and the fall of '96 And I mean they were very dif- 
ficult decisions." said Knox. 

Knox said she has decided to look for full-lime 
employment elsewhere because she cannot depend on 
her income as a part-Lime instructor at IPFW She 
said, "I am in the process, currently, of seeking full- 
time employment outside of the part-time position 



here. Not knowing what may come about. 1 could not 
make the commitment to teach part-time next semes- 
ter, because part-time, I do the same amount of work 
as when I'm full-time." said Knox. 

Knox substituted in a full-time capacity for the 
political science department in previous years. Last 
year she substituted for Professor Gerald Houseman, 
while he taught for one semester in Malaysia. The 
previous year Knox taught for associate professor 
Georgia Ulmsehneider, who was on leave 

"No new positions will be created this year as a 
result of the budgetary shortfall In fact, there are 
three fewer positions in Arts and Sciences this year 
than the previous year." David Cox, dean of arts and 
sciences said. "My hands are tied in terms of creating 
new faculty positions in Arts and Sciences, and 1 
assume the same situation exists in other areas of the 
university." he added 

According to Michael Downs, chair of political sci- 
ence, any decision to provide the money to create a 
position for Knox would have to be made by the chan- 
cellor, "Chancellor Wartell is the one who can make it 
happen The point at which it could have happened 



any place else has passed. Now it's 
Downs said. "The reason is that any 
money that could have been used for 
a full-time position in Arts and 
Sciences was committed last spring." 

"I believe the university needs 
more people of color, particularly 
faculty women color," said Linda 
Fox, director of women's studies and 
assistant professor of Spanish 
"Since Rheba has a proven ability in 
teaching. I would hope some way 
could be found to utilize her talents." 
she added. 

"1 have lived long enough to know 
that people who run institutions can 
do essentially whatever they feel is 
important to be done," Knox said. 
"Could the university be creative and 
do something else? I think so." 

Senior Wendy Musselman, a his- 
tory major, said she is upset by thi

concerned about developing an 
ethnically diverse staff, they 
haven't hired Rheba on in a more

Musselman. 

"It is a real shame that 
IPFW would deny students the 
opportunity to learn under such a 
dynamic professor as Rheba 
Knox," said freshman Debbie 
Morkcn. 

Some faculty members 
have expressed similar thoughts. 
"I know her work on and oft cam- 
pus. There is no doubt in my 
mind that she is one of the most 
gifted teachers I've ever seen. For 
African-American and European- 
American students, Rheba is most

African-American 
males answer 
Farrakhan's call for 
'Day of Atonement. ' 

by Melis.su Youn B -Flores 
News Editor 

Monday. African-American men from all 
over the nation answered a call for a "Million 
Man March." According to the National Park 
Service, 400,000 were estimated to have attend- 
ed the "Day of Atonement"; however, many 
who attended and several organizers believe 
more than a mdliou did attend. 

"A lot of people including African Americans 
didn't think this was realistic, but the sincerity 
and number of the people who attended was 
proof enough it was very real," said Crane 
Hcam. a local organizer and participant of the 
march. "It reassened the faith we already knew 
existed." 

"Our struggle was very well portrayed by 
those present and by the speakers," said Liz 
Dobyncs. president of the local NAACP 
Although the national chapter of the NAACP did 
not support the march. Dobyncs said individual 
members were permitted to participate or sup- 
port the event as normal citizens. 

Speakers from all areas of African -American 
life spoke to the crowd. Too much emphasis was 
placed io Louis Farrakhan's speech, said Charles 
Washington, associate director of career services 



ch, "The media put too 
hat perspective." said

Washington said, although Farrakhan and his 
speech was a major ponion of die event, the day 
meant much more than the controversy of the 
Nation of Islam leader's stance on other issues. 

"The march began with prayer at four in the 
morning, and Farrakhan did not speak until 4 

p.m.," Washington said. "It was a day of 

coming together I don't think it is a bad 
thing to say a 'Million Man March' - a 
focus on men taking responsibility." 

"We black women have been in the 
front of the struggle for so long." said 
Dobynes. "It was wonderful for our men 
to accept responsibility. I prayed in my 
heart this day would come. I thank God 
for this blessing." 

"The fabric of America is being torn 
apart, and it's black against black, black 
against white, white against white, 
while against black, yellow against 
brown, brown against yellow." 
Farrakhan said. "We are being lorn apart 
and we can't gloss it over with nice 
speeches." 

Issues, such as the fabric of America, 

brought forth by Farrakhan and many 

others at the march was the basis for the event. 
not haired said Dobyncs. 

"I don't dislike the thrust of the march. It was 
great especially for our men," said Dobynes. 
"Anybody else could not have done it better We 
are going to see results. Society is hard on men 
of color. I have the deepest sympathy and heart- 



felt conviction for my men. 1 can see why they 

turn to illegal things." 

According to Washington, the march was not 

only a day of atonement, but also a wonderful 

display of African-American men who already 

are doing things to help the black community. 
"It was important to see all of those "million" 

men who are doing those positive things." said 

Washington. 

According to 

Hearn and 

Washington, black 
males were not the 
only ones who 
attended the 

march Many 

women and 

Caucasians were 
present. "More

School of Nursing develops new master's degree 



by Rebecca Koenig 
Chief Reporter 

Keeping current with student's edu- 
cational needs, the Indiana Commission 
for Higher Education approved a new 
degree on August II. 1995. The degree 
is a Master of Science with a focus in 
Nursing Administration. Prior to being 
sent to the Indiana Commission for 
Higher Education, the degree was 
approved by the Purdue Board of 
Trustees in December of 1994. 

The degree focuses on nursing 
administration in the IPFW /Parkview 
nursing program Requirements for 
admission include: a baccalaureate 
degree with a major in nursing from an 



accredited institution; an average grade 
of "B" or better tn a completion of stud- 
ies equivalent to those required of a 
Purdue University baccalaureate degree 
and a license or eligibility for a license. 
These requirements are to insure knowl- 
edge and eligibility for clinical 
practicums. 

According to Dorothy Craig, division 
director of educational services at 
Parkview Hospital, there is a need for a 
Masters of Science in the Nursing 
Program. This degree will emphasize 
management skills, which nurses need 
in order to move into higher positions 
"I think as employers we see the 
increasing need for nurses to be well 
versed in managcment."said Craig As 



the largest employer of nurses in the 
Fort Wayne area. Parkview has an espe- 
cially insightful view of nursing educa- 
tion 

While the degree is important for 
hospital middle management positions, 
it has many more applications. It also is 
necessary in the whole area of managed 
care. It can be used for both manage- 
ment positions in home care and clinics. 

The graduate program will center on 
a variety of topics The focuses are 
organizational behavior; management of 
human, material and financial resources 
in health care fields; procedures in criti- 
cal thinking, sound research methods 
and investigating, legal and ethical con- 
siderations with patients, families and 



peers; and improving services through 
collaboration and consultation. 

Craig said it's still loo early to deter- 
mine if any problems exist within the 
program, but it should be well received 
by students and the community. In 
order to coincide with work schedules. 
many of the classes will be held in the 
evening. Still, no director has been 
found for the program. 

This program will allow students to 
achieve a higher level of education in a 
convenient way "It's a great opportu- 
nity for people in the nursing program 
to complete their education without 
moving out of the area," commented 
nursing student Dorothy Krevchuck.

Million Man 
March: Good 
idea, bad host 



Now, Louis ParT.ihkan can pui 
on his resume ihat he brought 
400,000 black men together. Nol 
an easy accomplishment This is 
not to say thai the Million Man 
March was Parrahkan's show. On 
Ibe conirary, ihc irnc stars were 
those in attendance ana, even more 
so, Ihosc who lake home what 
they've learned from the gathering. 

At first, excluding women from 
the day seemed to be a bad move 
But with thought, one can see the 
intent of the organizers. African- 
American males are in dire need of 
unity and responsibility. Black 
women arc a double coupon in this 
society. A company can hire a 
black woman and take care of Iwo 
issues of political correctness, by 
hiring a minority and a woman. 
African- American men have been 
shoved into a comer and ignored 



by society. 

Youth are always being told that 
ihey can be anything they want to 
be But black men know the real 
score. This march was a reminder 
that yes, they can achieve goals, 
hut it will take hard work, educa- 
tion and responsibility These 
responsibilities range from work 
ethics to family commitments If 
just a fraction of those in atten- 
dance go home and adhere to these 
challenges, change will undoubted- 
ly occur. 

As for Farrahkan, no one can 
justify the things he has said in the 
past. And he very well may lake 
credit for this massive crowd The 
ones who should walk away proud 
are those who attended, those who 
apply the knowledge and those 
who support them in ihc process.

Student Opinions 



Student views on Million Man March 



"The Million Man March was/is a 
wonderful gesture for the African- 
American people. If some change or 
alteration of the way our community is 
perceived, or if the mind set of our society 
is improved, then this event is doing 
what it was set out to do." 

Kimberly Essex 

Freshman 

Student of Sociology 



"I thought the march was beneficial but I 

thought the organizer of it was a 

negative for the event," 

Greg Feaster 

Freshman 
Student of Secondary Education 



"The Million Man March would be much 
more effective if it had been led by someone 

other than Farrahkan. His record of 

anti-Semitism, homophobia and intolerance 

of women is appalling. His reputation 

sabotages the march's credibility, doing 

little to further a positive perception 

of minorities or race relations."

Editorial 
Cartoonist praised 



Dear Editor; 

Kudos 10 Robert 
Squatrito for his editorial 
cartoon in The 
Communicator, Thursday, 
October 12 His simple, 
subtle images cut through 
the OJ. case race rhetoric 
and expose the core of the 
issue - Ms. Justice is dead 
indeed 

Actually, after an 
uphill batde in my gener- 
ation, she was mortally 
wounded fighting the 
abortion dragon which 
culminated in the terrific 
battles of Roe v. Wade 
and Doe v. Bolton on the 
same field on ihe same 
day. Lady Justice has laid 



dying for nearly 23 years, 
despite random acts of 
kindness. such as 
Indiana's 18-hour waning 
period so recently dis- 
cussed in The 
Communicator Knight 
Simpson's aci of euthana- 
sia administered at a cost 
of millions of dollars

the cost if she had only

Returning student defends IPFW 



Dear Editor; 

I don't think IPFW sucks. Never 
before in my life, including in my high 
school experience, have I been so stim- 
ulated to question and to learn. In high 
school. I was not stimulated at all — 
except to defend my social position as 
two degrees above the bottom, and the 
time I was accused of plagiarism for 
writing unlike most high school stu- 
dents who took Practical English: well. 

I am here to tell you what ii is all 



about for me. I'm 33 years old. I've 
worked at minimum wage menial labor 
peon jobs since I was 13 because, hell, 
in my neighborhood, money for clothes 
and food and sometimes the book fees 
for school and later or sooner for rent 
are more important than the faci a per- 
son might be bored and alienaied Or ai 
least that money seemed important, 
when its previous lack bad been so cus- 
tomary. Having an unsiimulating, 
unsatisfying job is what makes life a 



complete blur, not arising and coming 
to school each day On this campus I 
can call the shots on my education — 
what I learn, how much I learn, which 
classes I pick each semester and what I 
retain as important to me. For me, this 
campus has life. I can take classes that 
appear unrelated to my major because 
the subjects interest me (I'm gelling 
thai well-rounded education). Perhaps 
most of us with this alleged commuter- 
college syndrome are in our classes 



bringing our intellects to life instead of 
farting around in some "enormous 
crowd" out on the grounds. Some of us 
thought we were already having as 
much fun as we considered possible in 
this town, on this earth, and then, we 
discovered education. That discovery 
has expanded ihe possible outcomes 
and experiences in our lives. 

I have gotten up to live Here I am. 
at IPFW, 
Renee E Kotde 



Hiding sexuality is a compromise 



Dear Editor; 

First, in response to a letter to the 
editor published in ihe Oci. 12,1995 
issue; Ii would be a very ignorant per- 
son who would ask an African 
American to hide their color, even if it 
were possible Why would you ask a 
homosexual to hide their identity? We 
are proud of who we are and have every 
right to be. jusi as any person of color is 
justifiably proud of who they are. The 
choice to hide our identity cannot be an 
option. By doing so we deny ourselves. 
By hiding our spirit we allow others to 
control our lives through intimidation 
and fear. That control is deadly. Ii 



crushes our self respect, our dignity and 
our freedom. 

The number one cause of teen sui- 
cide is homosexuality. These teens are 
made to be ashamed of being who they 
are and have no strong, positive role 
models With other minorities, (hose 
who i .urn. .i hide their color, the accom- 
plishments of individuals cannot be 
ignored. Other groups have the support 
of family and fnends as well as a com- 
munity rich in history and strength If 
homosexuals continue to hide who we 
are, we cannot gain the respect we 
deserve as a group, build a strong com- 
munity and end discrimination. Instead, 



we will continue to passively encourage 
our own oppression 

Second. Oct. II marked National 
Coming Out Day Fliers were posted, 
proclaiming it blue jean day in support 
of this The response was another flier 
campaign for the following day, asking 
students to proclaim their support for 
heterosexual ity by wearing footwear of 
any kind. Personally, I thought (his was 
a clever response to what was meant as 
a tongue in cheek campaign Was It 
silly? Sure. Was it a bad idea? 
Possibly. Was any one offended? 
Probably. Was anyone hurt? No. The 
point is, feel free to disagree Bui 



remember, there is a line between dis- 
agreement handled cleverly and gay 
bashing. 

Third, a student recently said to me 
that he does not need a group like 
ALSO. However, our community 
needs lo establish groups such as ALSO 
in order to establish a positive voice 
within the community and lo those out- 
side of it. We need the support of every 
student in order to make a difference on 
this campus and in the community as a 
whole.

Some may argue that being gay. 
or personal lives in general, has little 
importance to history. I would accept 
this if students did not assume every 
figure was heterosexual. To learn 
about Henry V11I. you need to know 
he was married, a.k.a. straight. It is 
true that one docs not need to know 
that Martina Navratilova is gay to 
recognize her tennis achievements 
But she should also be noted as a 
leading member of the gay rights 
movement because of her struggle as 
an openly gay athlete. Because of 
this, she has lost out on the multimil- 



lion dollar endorsements offered to 
other athletes 

If you insist on ignoring this 
important factor of the lifestyles of 
our history makers, then let's teach 
our children about the gay rights

Through Free Speech, Barnett took

responded with death threats, and 
ultimately a mob ol them attacked

newspaper. But they didn't destroy

While supremacists still use vio-

violent repression, censorship and 
moral cowardice in Springfield, 
Illinois. Thai's where, for ihe past 
nine years, a blind black man named 
Mbanna Kantako has been airing 
Black Liberation Radio. Kantako's 
story is spotlighted in an article on 
micro-radio by Steve Ongerth &amp; 



national thought-cops The 7- article 
notes, however, that when Kantako 
started "airing first-hand accounts of 
police brutality against local black 
citizens," he got plenty of heat. 

Ever since, local cops have been 
harassing Kantako and his family. 2 
reports they arrested his nine year old 
son for "being involved in a shoving 
malch in a soccer game at his ele- 
mentary school." When someone shot 
at Kantako with a 357 magnum (the 
bullet barely missed his head) the 
police declined to investigate. The 
article added lhat "All 15 of 
Springfield's mainstream media out- 
lets virtually ignored this incident." 

Attempted murder in Springfield 
is apparently OK, so long as iis con- 
ducted against speakers the authori- 
ties and their corporate press lapdogs 
don't like. Meanwhile, the speech 
they don't like is deemed a crime. 
Springfield's chief of police did his 
part lo stamp out thought-crime 
when, embarrassed by Kantako's 
radio revelations, he complained to 
the Federal Communications 
Commission. Consequently, for

The Milliard Gates Sports Ccnier 
features work-oul facilities for any- 
one from the novice 10 die devoted 
work out enthusiast, such as Tom 
Baitaglia a sophomore majonng in 
physical iherapy. 

"1 come here because it's less 
crowded (than a private health 
club) People are more serious 
here They come to work out." said 
1 I 11 i.n'i 1 1 who is into power lifting. 

For others, Gates is a good place

is a great alternative for walkers 
who find the weather starting 10 get

out on much of the campus as 
you walk or run around the 
track. 

Bring a friend or come 
alone, just get moving Once 
you get warmed up. there art- 
many other opportunities for 
exercise 

Besides the (rack. Gates 
offers a whole series of 
Nautilus equipment and free- 
weight training equipment, 
bicycles, stairmasiers, a tread- 
mill, rowers, slant boards and 
stretch mats. The iri-level facil- 
ity also includes five racquet-

Many of

works out at

The busiest times, according to 
staff at Gates, are mornings 
between 6 and 8 am and after-

Besides, I already pay for it with

Kurt/., who has been working out 
at Gates since summer, said she was 
surprised to sec the variety of work- 
oul equipment. 

"It is very comparable to a health 
club. It has everything they do. 
except a hot tub or whirlpool," said 
Kurtz.

The perfect dinner party 



Editor 

After months of playing dust- 
bunny football underneath my bed, 
an idea sprang forth from my brain. 
Immediately, 1 summoned my usual 
crew of idiots and we had a pow- 
wow. Our subject this edition con- 
cerned ihe five people with whom 
we would like to have dinner and a 
round table discussion over coffee. 

At first, we tried to limn our- 
selves to one specific topic, but we 
found that idea too confining. Next, 
we atlempted to keep our guest to a 
list of living people, but there are 
not enough living people who arc 
interesting enough to have for din- 
ner. At lasi we found our solution: 
anyone, living or dead, fictional or 
non-fictional could be on our list. 
This survey was not scientific and 
we Ined to be an equal opportunity 
host. Without further fanfare, here 
they are: 

■ Malcolm X — After reading his 
autobiography, I found myself 
drawn to his charisma and wanted 
to know more about him Afier a 
search, which lasted for two years, 1 
found very liitle about him which 
was not biased in some way or 
another. So an invitation is sent out 
to the soul of Malcolm X. 
• Ayn Rand — One of the most pre- 
eminent philosophers of the twenti- 
eth century would make a fine addi- 
tion to my little round table I have 
read both "Atlas Shrugged" and 
"The Fountain head," and I have 
many questions to ask her She 
would also be able to hold her own 
against the eloquence of Brother 
Malcolm 



■ Sherlock Holmes — Although fic- 
tional, Holmes possessed the most 
logical and analytical mind this side 
of Mr. Spock. Holmes would shed 
an interesting light on Rand and 
Brother Malcolm's conversation. 

■ Qucntin Tarantino — Tarantino 
would add a twisted spin on Ibe 
whole conversation. His wit and 
style would lighten up the serious- 
ness of the whole discussion. I can 
also see a love interest developing 
between Rand and Tarantino. What 
an interesting couple. 

• Clarence Darrow — Danow. also a 
philosopher, would brilliantly con- 
trast much of what Rand believes 
and would assuredly make a con- 
nection with Brother Malcolm. 
Darrow is a bit of a socialist, and 
Rand would attack him with fury. 

Those were the actual people we 
invited but if one of these esteemed 
people do not R.S.V.P. our list of 
alternates is as follows: Martin 
Luther King Jr.. Ralph Nader, 
George Lucas, Vince Lombardi, 
Socrates. Henry David Thoreau. 
Mohandas K. Ghandi. James Earl 
Jones (for.if nothing else, his 
voice), Dr. Seuss (with Sam I am). 



Sitting Bull, and Kel 
Chief Little Turtle. 



political science, who also works at 
the Sports Center, He pointed oul 
that all of the machines have 
instructions and pictures that 
explain how they work. He and 
other staff arc available for assis- 
tance. 

"Virtually always there is some- 
one working in the weight room 
who is trained in all of the 
machines," said Ross 

He also stressed the convenience 
of having showers and towels avail- 
able. 

"You're all set up. You can 
come in after class, work out, show- 
er, and go on with your day without 
having to go home." Ross said. 

Another plus is that people who 
work out at Gales are more interest- 
ed in working oul than in watching 
other people, according to Ross.

B-side compilations 
arc rarely 
worthy of 
mentioning 
lo ihe average 
CD buyer. 
Dul for (be 
serious collec- 
tor, ihey can be 
Iruc gems. One 
or the best ant) 
most complete 
collections thai 
this music fan 
has discovered 
is entitled 

"Alternative Pet Shop Boys." 

This two-disc set covers aJl of 




the Boys songs that accompanied 
the released singles we heard on the 
radio and in the clubs Most of 
these have never before 
appeared on previous 
albums, 

For those who are 
not familiar with a B- 
side, which has become 
a dying art in the age 
of remixes of the sin- 
gle, you should know 
that B-sides show true 
experimental creativi- 
ty. A band often 
records songs that do 
not fit the overall 
concepts of the album, so 
they may decide lo release these 
often obscure culs lo the public via 
B-side. Other artists use B-sides lo 



create dimensions outside their 
realm of usual expressive tech- 
niques Both of these arc represent- 
ed on "Alternative." 

The songs are in order of cre- 
ation and show the progress of the 
Boys since their debut in 1983 (can 
you believe Neil and Chris have 
been around that long?). 
"Paninaro," ihe albums first single, 
features Chris Lowe, the silent part- 
ner if you will, on lead vocals. 
Now, I could tell you the story 
behind each song, but ihe booklet 
includes an interview of ihe Boys 
explaining the origin of each cut. 

Included on the second disc is a 
version of "Losing My Mind," one 
of the songs the Pel Shop Boys pro- 
duced for Liza Minelli This cut 
includes a mad laugh — courtesy of 




Neil Tennant — that was subtracted 
from ihe "Results" version. 

Many of the songs also have gay 
underlying tones to them. This was 
before ihe Boys publicly came out, 
and "Very" told stories of gay love 
and going west young man 



"Eurohoy" is the name of a 
European soft-porn magazine, as 
well as a song title on 
"Alternative." 

This compilation offers a 
refreshing, poetic aura lhat was 
missing from their other compila- 



tion. "Discography." which charted 
the Pel Shop Boys singles work 
This album is highly recommended 
for Ihose who enjoy dancing to 
Euro-synth music as well as hearing 
good siories. 



Author provides 'Cliff Notes' to credit reporting 



by Clark Rogers 
Guest Writer 

WHERE DID CREDIT 

REPORTING COME FROM? 

Around the turn of ihe century, 
local merchant-owned credit 
bureaus across the country began 
collecting various types of informa- 
tion on Americans and American 
businesses, based on community 
"hearsay " 

Today, the companies lhat gather 
and sell your personal financial 
information arc called "consumer 
reporting agencies." The three 
most widely recognized agencies 
are Equifax, TRW and Trans 
Union. 

Commonly referred to as the 
"Big Three." these agencies are part 
of a multi-billion dollar information 
industry that actually define (not 
determine! the financial standing of 
more than 200 million adult 
Americans 

Approximately 900 
smaller, indepen- 
denlly owned 
and operated 
credit bureaus 
do business 
nationwide. 
These smaller 
bureaus have con- 
tractual agreements 
wiih any one or more 
of the Big Three lo 
access their credit report- 
ing services for local and region- 
al communities. 

WHERE DO CREDIT FILES 
ON ME ORIGINATE? 

Credit files do not exist until a 
credit grantor requests one. Their 
existence is called inio being only 
when you, yourself, fill out an 
application and apply for credit. 

This file, when primed out. is 
called a "credit report." 

WHERE ELSE DOES 

INFORMATION ABOUT ME 

COME FROM? 

Public record information is 
gathered directly from court and 
county records You are also ihe 
source of information lhat is report- 
ed to the Big Three every time you 
inquire about, add lo or dispute 
information directly in your file. 

DO I HAVE ANY RIGHTS? 




Because of the increasing prob- 
lems consumers had with ihe grow- 
ing credit reporting industry in the 
1960's, The Fair Credit Reporting 
Act was drafted by Congress and 
enacted on April 25. 1971. 

This Act protects consumers 
against the circulation of inaccurate, 
misleading or obsolete information, 
and requires the consumer reporting 
agencies to adopt fair and equitable 
procedures for obtaining, maintain- 
ing and giving out information 
about consumers. 

WHAT IS IN MY CREDIT 

REPORTS? 
Credit reports may only contain: 
consumer information (name 
address, date of birth and social 
security number); informauon about 
loans, charge accounts and credit 
cards; and public record informa- 
tion 

Credit reports do noi and may 
noi contain informauon about: race; 
religious preference, personal 
assets; medical history, personal 
lifestyle or background; or crimi- 
nal record (although, some 
stales have begun listing 
delinquent child sup- 
port payments 
here.) 

HOW UP- 
TO-DATE 
ARE MY 
CREDIT 
REPORTS? 
Most 
^^^^ businesses report 
credit data every 30 
days. Some companies report their 
information quarterly (4 limes a 
year). 

HOW LONG DOES INFORMA- 
TION STAY ON MY CREDIT 
REPORTS? 
Federal law permits positive 
informal ion about current accounts 
to remain on one's credit reports 
indefinitely. Closed or paid off 
accounts will be removed wilhin 
seven years. Negative credit infor- 
mation, as well as lax liens, law- 
suits, and judgments, arc erased 
afier seven years. Bankruptcies 



remain on credit reports for a maxi- 
mum of ten years.- 

WHO HAS ACCESS TO MY 
CREDIT REPORTS? 

Credit bureaus do not allow 
everyone to see your credit reports 
Only businesses wiih "permissible 
purposes" have the legal right lo 
access your credit files. 

Permissible purposes include: 
credit evaluation by potential 
lenders; insurance underwriting; 
employment hiring decisions; the 
granting of a license; a connection 
wiih other business needs involving 
a transaction wiih consumers; and 
in response to a court order or fed- 
eral jury subpoena. The U.S. 
Government, on all levels, may also 
access your credit reports. 

Businesses having permissible 
purposes to utilize the services of 
Ihe Big Three or credit bureaus are 
called "subscribers". 

Whenever you sign an applica- 
tion, you give the lender/ employ- 
er/insurer permission lo access your 
credit report 

HOW CAN I TELL WHEN 

SOMEONE HAS ACCESSED 

MY CREDIT FILE? 

Your credit report must reveal 
who has received a copy of your 
report. This is known as an 
"inquiry." Inquiry listings are post- 
ed whenever you, a creditor, an 
insurance eompany, or potential 
employer requests a copy of your

likely to help them slay on campus 
as students," Richard Johnson, 
associate professor of Germanic 
studies raid, 

Ulm Schneider, for whom Knox 
has substituted, said, "She is a won- 
derful teacher, and I would love lo 
have her as a colleague." 

"I ihoughi thai if something 
could be found here, so thai she 
could he working with more stu- 
dents with more problems, it would 
mean a tremendous increase in the 
ability of the campus lo deal with 
students who confront a variety of 
problems." said Downs 

According to Cox, there are 140 
full-time professors in Aris and 
Sciences. Solomon Isiorho, associ- 
ate professor of geoscicnccs, is the 
only one of African descent Cox 
could not say exactly how many 
pan-time positions were filled by 
African Americans, but he did indi- 
cate that it was only a "handful." 



Cox attributes the lack of sub- 
stantial numbers of African- 
American professors in Aris and 
Sciences to the absence of a net- 
work system between IPFW and 
African Americans who arc about 
lo finish graduate school and begin 
searching for employment at a uni- 
versity Cox said a person is more 
likely to apply for a position at a 
university if he or she knows peo- 
ple who arc there. 

Cox referred to an attempt by 
IPFW 10 create a network system 
three or four years ago during 
David McCant's term as vice chan- 
cellor. 

Associate Professor Josue Njock 
Libit, functioning as interim associ- 
ate vice chancellor, oversaw the 
program, bui Cox said. "The results 
were limited " 

There is, currently, no systemat- 
ic program in place for the recruit- 
ment and retention of minorities. 
"When we receive an application 
from an African American, we pay 



close attention to it. and there is 
certainly an awareness of it." said 
Cox "Whatever it is we are doing. 
it is not working " 

"1 would venture to guess that 
very few students on this campus 
have had any significant interac- 
tions with people who are different, 
in particular, people of African 
descent, and especially in the con- 
text of that person as their profes- 
sor," said Knox. 

"1 feel good about what I have 
been able lo offer to the studenis 
who have come through my classes, 
not only in terms of the basic con- 
tent or (he course, but just as an 
opportunity to interact with some- 
one who is different, and again with 
someone they have not bad any 
experiences with." said Knox. 

"The University seeks diversity 
The University is supposed to seek 
excellence, and in Rheba they have 
both," said Downs 

Chancellor Wartell declined to

ly impact black Americans, it is 
also about black men taking 
renewed responsibility for them- 
selves, their families, and their 
communities," President Clinton 
said Monday in a speech about 
American race relations at the 
University of Texas. "Let us pray 
thai those who have spoken for 
hatred and division in the past will 
turn away from that past and give 
voice to the true message of those 



ordinary Americans who march If 
that happens, the men and the 
women who are there with them 
will be marching into better lives 
for themselves and their families 
and they could be marching into a 
better future for America." Clinton 
said. 

Senate Majority Leader Dob 
Dole later attacked the president 
for not calling Farrakan out by 
name. "I am shocked and dismayed 
thai President Clinton did not find 
the moral courage to denounce 



Louis Farrakhan by name in his 
speech today in Texas," said Dole 
"Farrakhan is a racist and anti- 
Semite, unhinged by hale. He has 
no place in American public life, 
and all who would lead must say 
so." 

Washington said despite all of 
the controversy, the event made 
history. "The march is now a pan 
of history," said Washington. "I 
was there and no one can take that 
away from me."

School of Public and Environmental Affairs plans to offer spring 
students a Bachelor of Science in Health Services Management 



hy Rehecca Koenin 
Chief Reporter 

Students with an associate degree in nursing, dental 
hygiene, dental laboratory lechnology or one of the 
allied health sciences will soon have the opportunity lo 
expand their education in a new direction. Beginning 
January 1996, Ihe School of Public and Environmental 
Affairs will offer a Bachelor of Science in Health 
Services Management. 

Management science, personnel management, finan- 
cial planning and management, statistics and computer 
use are all planned to be stressed. After graduating 
from the program, a person would be qualified for a 
management position in hospital service departments, 
public and private health care maintenance organiza- 



lions. home hc.ilth care agencies ami preferred provider 
organizations. The degree also serves as preparation 
for health administration graduate siudy. 

The new degree will be implemented al two other 
Indiana University campuses. Indiana University 
Northwest and Indiana University South Bend both 
expect to see a strong demand for the program in die 
future. 

While students will not need to complete an intern- 
ship or praciicum for the degree, the course will require 
120 credit hours to he completed. Students will be 
required lo spend 12 hours on management core 
requirements. 39 credit hours on general education of 
study and 27 credit hours on health service concentra- 
tion requires. Forty iwo hours are allotted for Ihe 



Associate Degree Program and General Elective 
Requirements. 

A limit has not been established on the number of 
students who can enroll in Ihe program. William 
Ludwin, assistant dean/division director, expects 
enrollment for the firsi year to be about 12 studenis. 
half of whom are expected lo be current IPFW stu- 
dents. Many working toward the degree are already in 



ihe work force. For ihis reason, many of ihe classes 
will be offered in Ihe evening, according to Ludwin. 

The proposal submiiied to the Indiana Commission 
for Higher Education states thai no new facility mem- 
bers will be needed to leach courses for the degree in 
the first year. Once enrollment rises an addiiional 
health facility member will probably be needed.

Supporting each and every [earn. 
as well as gelling the crowds behind 
Ihc learns, is a major responsibility 
h ukes unwavering commilmeni, a 

willingness lo give up some of ihe 
other social aspects of college life 
and. ai limes, enduring ridicule. The 
chosen job of a cheerleader is not 



according 10 this year's captains. 
Tom Voltz and Michelle Zook. 

"Our job is 10 motivate crowds 
and lo develop school spirit. Not 
only ai the athletic events but in the 
community as well," said Voltz. 

His girlfriend and co-captain on 
ihe cheering squad, Zook. agrees 
with him and adds that it lakes a lot 
of work thai no one seems to appre- 



Another drug addict 
steps to the plate 



llndcr the bt toe fitrs 



King 
George is 
at it once 
again, lie 
weni out 
and signed 
another 
drug addict 
10 play (or 
ihe New 
York 
Yankees. 
Keeping 
wiih the 
tradition of 
signing 

players 

such as 
Steve Howe and D;irryl Strawberry, 
both of whom were suspended for 
drug related incidents, Steinbrenner 
inked a S6 million, three-year deal 
with Dwight "Doc" Goodcn. The 
Yankees will pay Gooden SI mil- 
lion, plus incentives based on his 
performance next season. In "97 
"Doc" stands to earn %2 million 
and in "98, S3 million. 

Goodcn missed all of the 1995 
season because he violated an after- 
care program related to a June 1994 
cocaine suspension. The 1985 
National League Cy Young award 
winner was 3-4 with a dismal 6.31 
ERA in 1994 for the New York 
Mcts. He has reached the near end 
of his career 

To his credit, Goodcn is partici- 
pating in a 12-siep program with 
Narcotics Anonymous. But, Ihe 
queslion begs lo be asked, when 
does professional spon stop hand- 
ing out second chances? The sports 
world is once again guilty of por- 
traying a disturbing image to 
youngsters. In a world where few 
"heroes" can be considered role 
models, it is a shame that men with 
ihe big bucks care so little they sign 
baseball players/drug addicts like 



Strawberry. Howe and Gooden. 

Sieinbrenner defends his signing 
of Gooden as an aci of kindness. 
Ihe "good Samaritan" role. He 
claims thai by paying Gooden lo 
play for the Yankees, he is giving 
Gooden another shot ai life. I say if 
you really want to give ihe guy a 
shot at a new life, lake him oul of 
Ihe environment lhat influenced his 
addiction. Give him a broom and 
let him clean the aisles. Send him 
back to school to get an education. 
It simply makes no sense lo 
give a former major league siar the 
economic siaius he enjoyed before 
he was caught with his hand in the 
cookie jar. With more money than 
he has had in some lime and with 
the right connections, can one be 
positive he won't slip back inio his 
drug-related habits'* 

I realize that all of this Is pure 
conjeciure. bui think back to Howe 
and his addiction. Suspended, re- 
hired, suspended, re-hired... When 
will professional sports organi/a- 
lions. especially baseball, realize 
Ihai no one is actually cured of a 
drug addiction? They only recover 
It is a vicious circle, and when the 
tempiaiion presenls itself, it may 
prove too much lo handle. 

1 sincerely hope and pray thai 
Gooden has his head screwed on 
straight this time and can give Ihe 
fans a couple more years of the 
magic he displayed early in his 
career. From 1984 to 1994, Gooden 
was 157-85 for the New York 
Mcts. Maybe he can regain that 
glory, maybe nol. In either case il is 
a shame that King George has pui 
him in that position. 

Take ii as you will... jusi 
remember, the view from under the 
bleachers is not always a pretty 
sight.

ciatc a good cheerleader. 

"We pui in a lot of hours. We 
practice about 10 hours a week and 
work oul another five hours You 
have lo sec ii 10 appreciate il." said 
Zook. 

Zook and Voltz commented 
about about cheerleading require- 
ment m order 10 increase audience 
appreciation for the amount of work 
which goes into a college level 
cheerleader. 

According 10 Zook, all of the 
cheerleaders on this year's squad 
take dieting and fitness quite seri- 
ously. The strength it requires to 
achieve some of the stunis per- 



formed on the couri require each 
member of die team 10 be in tip-top 
shape It is a spon like no other and 
do not question ihe fad that these 
are true athletes. 

'"Lifting is crucial. I do not think 
another sport requires as much 
muscular aciiviiy ( as cheerlead- 
ing)." said Vollz. 

The fact thai there are men and 
women combined on ihe learn also 
adds a different aspect lo cheerlead- 
ing, according lo Voltz and Zook 
As a spon that involves both men 
and women, cheerleading is unique. 

"The commitment here is just as 
great as in any olher sport, said 



Voltz. Everybody out here practices 
a lot and really has committed 
themselves to being a good cheer- 
leader," 

Although the crowds at home- 
games have been a little sparse 
this season, both captains hope 10 
see more fans as die year wears on 
The icam has grown from eight 
members last year. 10 2fi coed 
members this season There arc 
enough cheerleaders this year lo 
field two teams I he coed squad is 
complimenied by an all-women's 
squad. The women's squad will 
continue cheering ai various events 
but will also add a more daney per- 



formance to ilicir program 

Cheerleading has become the 
biggesi aspect uf each le.un mem- 
ber's college life. It is a \port ihat 
requires endless hours of prepara- 
tion riT.niKC and commitment, 
much like the teams that compete 
on ihe floor between lime-outs 

"Cheerleading lakes up mosi of 
my life It's like a dream come true 
for me. I have always wanted to be 
a college cheerleader." said Zook

B-Ball teams look for improvement 



by Jim Porter 
Spurts Editor 

Midnight Madness, a rccenl tra- 
dition on many college campuses 
across Ihc country, officially ush- 
ered in the 1995-96 basketball sea- 
son From Purdue University, lasi 
year's Dig 10 men's champions, to 
Arizona, students welcomed the 
most revered of all college sports. 

The hoopla went uncelebrated at 
IPFW. Nonetheless, ihe 1995-96 
basketball season is upon us. Both 
the men's and women's teams 
began official practice this week 
and expect successful campaigns 
this season. 

The Great Lakes Valley 
Conference has once again been 
ranked as the country's toughest 
Division II basketball conference. 
Last season, three teams were 
ranked in ihe top 20 and defending 
NCAA national champion. 
Southern Indiana, is a prc-season 
number one. The Mastodon's Head 
Coach. Andy Piazza, enters the sea- 
son with guarded optimism. 

"We set very high goals each 
season I am always opiimisiic. and 
I am looking for this team lo over- 
achieve," said Piazza. 

With only one senior on the ros- 
ier this season the 'Dons have a 
challenging lask ahead of ihcm. 
The conference coach's pre-season 
poll ranks the Mastodons ai number 
nine. Defending champion, 
Souihcrn Indiana, and Northern 
Kentucky head the list on the men's 



"There arc a lot of question 
marks with three new teams in the 
conference this year. 

The league is defi- 

nilely the strongest il 
has been since I have 
been here," said 
Piazza. 

In his nimh season 
ai the helm for the 
*Dons, Piazza has 
guided one team, the 
1993 squad, id posi- 
scason play. 

This season, much 
like last season. Ihe 
men's team is loaded 
wiih lalcnt, but short 
on experience Only 
one senior returns to 
the team. Seven other 
players have a mere 
iwo years of colle- 
giate experience. 

"We still do not 
have veieran players. 
We are young, said 
Piazza. "We were u.wijcon 
totally inexperienced 
last year. This year we have a bii 
more experience, and I think that 
Ihe kids realize we can play with 
anybody." 

The 'Dons ended the season on a 
(ear last year as they won their last 
six games. At Southern Indiana the 
'Dons losl at the buzzer to the team 
that was crowned naiional champi- 
ons three weeks later. 

"Lasi year we took our lumps 



early. This season I hope thai our 
experience translates inio a quicker 
siart. A loi depends on how hard 
Ihey worked in ihe 
oTf season We 
also plav 15 of 27 
games at home 
ihis year I hat is 
an advantage,"

and 



vork on 



defense lo stop 
(heir opponenls. 
The major prob- 
lem for Head 
Coach Pam 

Dowden and her 
squad, thus far, 
has been nagging 
injuries. 

"A lot depends 
On whether every- 
body stays 

callhy," 



Dowden. "They are beginning 
understand our philosophy 
style of play." 

Last year, Bowden's first 
head coach, the 'Dons had to adji 
to a new style of offense, as well 



nd 



concentrate on opponents. This sea- 
son. Dowden hopes to see her team 
grab a new attitude along with a lot 
of rebounds 

"These arc good people who 
need lo develop a hunger. Thcv 
need to decide thai this is nut house 
and no one is going lo come In here 
and lake anylhing from us. We 
need for people to be a little scared 
of us," said Dowden. 

The ability lo achieve all lhat the 
learn desires seems lo be on Ihc 
[able according lo Bowden. She 
said ihai she is pleased with the 
overall work effort that has been 
demonstraicd thus far, and lhat the 
desire lo accomplish good things is 
being demonstrated in workout. 

"They want to accomplish a lot. 
We have high cxpeciaiions for the 
season and have a number of play- 
ers who love the game," she said. 

Dowden said many good things 
are expccicd from this year's team, 
and that success Ihis year will set 
Lhe tone for years lo come. 

"We are continually building for 
the future, and, like I told them, 
what ihey accomplish ihis year will
