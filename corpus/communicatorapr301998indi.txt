Hoosier singer to perform May 8 



Bv DooiE Miller 
Chief Reporter 



The Canie Newcomer Band 
brings a brand of genre-crossing 
folk lo Fort Wayre on Friday, May 
8. at 8 p.m ai The Lofi. 

A portion of the proceeds will 
benerilMaiaiew2S. 

Mailbew 25 is a non-profil 
facility offering free or reduced raie 
medical and dental services for 
low-income clienls. 

Newcomer's latest CD is called 
"My True Name." She will appear 
with her band and special guc^l 
Matt Bryer. 

Carrie Newcomer has been 
hailed as one of the definitive voic- 
es of the heartland. 

The musician/poet has been 
described as having an intimate 
strength of voice and character. 

Noting her quiet strength and 
deep womanly wisdom, the Village 
Voice WTOte. "She has a wann spir- 
it, heated iniclligcncc, burning liI- 
em. Newcomer is hard on society, 
softer on humanity-glinting with 
musical brightness." 

Newcomer's road to critical 
acclaim was driven on via her 
Toyota station wagon. While travel- 
ing in the car she was able (o sell 
large quantities of her independent 
albums. 

Newcomer retired the cai after 
200.000 miles, and caught the 
attention of Rounder Records, 
which is based in Cambridge. Mass. 

Subsequently. Rounder 



released "An Angel ai 
My Shoulder." (1994) 
and "The Bird or the 
Wing."(l995). 

Newcomer's 
lyrics seem not only to 
be self-affirming, but 
offer a strong and 
binding love to those 
she cares about, as 
evidenced in the song, 
"Amelia Ahnosi 13." 
a song for her daugh- 
ter's blossoming ado- 
lescence. 

Newcomer sings. 
". . . damn the first 
man who comes to 
break your heart ' 
While informing the 
girl of the inevitable, 
Newcomer seems to 
encourage her not to 
become a victim. 

Carrie 
Newcomer's CDs 
have styles on them 
thai range from lilting 
Cajun to almost rock 'n' roll. 

The messages are nearly as 
m&gt;Tiad as the musical style pro- 
duced in pan by a tight Five-piece 
band. 

The folksy "My Father's Only 
Son," Newcomer explores the spe- 
cial bond between fathers and 
daughters, and the Cajun tinged 
"You Can Choose," are just a sam- 
ple of Newcomer's vctsatilily. 

Carrie Newcomer grew up in 
Indiana as one of three daughters of 
an Italian-immigrant Catholic 
mother, and a Mennonite/Amish 
faOier 

According lo a Denver Post 
interview, "Some people have 




Hoosier Carrie Newcomer will appear at The LofI on Friday, May 8, al 8 p. 



always hungered in their hearts for 
a spiritual life," she said. "It's 
always been something I've pur- 
sued on my own." 

That pursuit has led her to 
become a pmclicing Quaker. 

Currently, she lives in 
Bloominglon with her husband and 
daughter. 

Newcomer's emotional invest- 
ment in her work is obvious in the 
final result, and to the artist as the 
process of writing begins. 

"Most writers I know didn't 
choose to write, but write because 
Uiey were always called to. It's as if 
we are bom restless, carrying some- 
thing th:ii can't let us go and won't 



let us stop." 

The inietligeni. insightful and 
touching lyrics are given life 
through Newcomer's voice. 

Her throaty alto was described 
in the Austin-American Statesman 
as ". . .an instrument as dark, rich 
and luscious as Godiva chocolate." 

Newcomer was inspired by 
such artists as Lylc Lovett and 
Alison Krauss, both of whom are 
known for their ability to genre- 
cro;is.

Internships provide opportunities 



By DoiME Miller 
Chief Reporter 



With the spring semester nearly com- 
pleted, summer is not far from the minds of 
many students. 

Summer carries the connoution of lazy. 
idyllic days spent doing nothing. Three 
IPFW students will be doing the exact 
opposite of that. 

Three IPFW siudcnts were chosen to 
participate in the Indiana University 
Biology Summer Undergraduate Research 
Internship 



Program this 
summer. 
The selected 
applicants arc: 
senior NaTosha 
Galson; biology 
and pre-med. 
junior Timo 
Dygert: biology, 
and junior 
Michael Heniser; 
biology and prc- 
mcd. 
A total of nine- 
teen recipients 
were selected 
statewide, seven 
of whom will 
conduct their 
research at cam- 
puses other than 

at Bloominglon. 

The olhcr 
research sites include Indianapolis. Fort 
Wayne. Soudi Bend, and Nonhwesi (Gary). 
Bob Gillespie, associate professor of 
biology, says that this summer will be the 
first time in the scholarship's history thai 
the program is available for IPFW studcnLs 
to work at home. 

"Now our students can work hea'," he 
says. 

The internships grew out of a program 
offered by the Biology Undergraduate 
In illative - 

Of the nineteen recipients, seven are 
doing research outside of Bloominglon. 



"This intern- 
ship pro- , 
motes not 
only lab 
research, but 
field work, 
which is use- 
ful in the 
career world 
as well." , 



tkology ind pre-ra») 



Students will receive a S2,400 scholar- 
ship, plus the amount of the registration fee 
for one credit hour of independent research. 

All participants must devote 12 weeks 
of the summer session to their project on a 
full-time basis. 

In addition to the scholarship, the stu- 
dents also receive a living stipend. 

According to Gillespie, this is "the 
beauty of it." because the students do not 
have to work. Therefore, they can devote 
more of their lime to their respective pro- 
jects. 

It is important that students interested in 
biology have an opportunity to, as Gillespie 
said, "do science." 

"No matter what they do widi their 
degrees, it gives them an opportunity to sec 
how science works," said Gillespie. 

It is not as if IPFW does not have any 
opportunities for students lo hone their sci- 
entific skills. However, it is rather limited, 
especially in contrast widi the opponunhies 
offered by the state. 

"We have a formal course in which a 
student can sign up to do research with a 
professor," said Gillespie. "But the credits 
are Umited that way, students have to fit it 
around other classes and work." 

Gillespie is in favor of the potential for 
learning thai is created by research intern- 
ships. 

"I ihink it gives diem an excellent 
shon-term, but intense, opportunity to do 
science." he said. "It really leaches them 
how 10 do biology." 

Bob Gillespie is noi only associate pro- 
fessor of biology, he also serves as mentor 
to Michael Heniser, a recipient of the schol- 
arJiip. He is very clear on his role as men- 
tor, 

"I simply supervise one student's 
research. It is a very close relationship." he 
said. He noted ihai a more hands-off. or dis- 
tanced approach would not work. 

Gillespie points out thai the general 
duties of the student involved in research 
are to collect data and conduct analysis. 

The mentors help them to write about 
their fmdings and show the studcnLs bow to 
present their findings. 

"It is more of an apprentice relation- 
ship, really." he said. 

The bond thai is formed between men- 
tor and student is satisfying to him. 



He also points out that the apprentice- 
type of relationship is "a great way to 

change somebody's life." 

It is helpful lo students to have the 
assistance of a knowledgeable mentor close 
at hand. 

Gillespie is happy with his involvement 
in the program. 

"As a teacher to alinost tutor and give 
one-on-one attention is an ideal situation," 
he said. "To it do with more students [have 
the opportunity available to more students) 
would be die only way to make it better." 

The mentor-student relationship is 
enhanced by the fact that the student's work 
mirrors that of die mentor. 

Heniser's project, "Evaluation of 
Stocking Success of Three Species in the 
Maumee River, Fort Wayne," is similar to 
Gillespie's work, which makes them an 
ideal mentor-student pair 

"It's an exciting opponunhy given by 
lU. since diey will be helping us do the pro- 
ject," said HenLser. 

"'Ibis internship promotes not only lab 
research, but field work, which is useful in 
the career world as well," added Heniser. 

As Gillespie recalls. Heniser contacted 
him about research opportunities. 

The two were acquainted by Heniser's 
attendance in classes laughi by Gillespie. 

One of the other recipients, Timo 
Dygcn. will be working with Richard 
Manalis, associate professor of biology. 

The title of their project is "The 
Interaction between Faciliiation and 
Depression at the Frog Neuromuscular 
Junction." - 

NaTosha Gatson's faculty mentor is 
Shree Dhawale. associate professor of biol- 
ogy. 

Their project is entitled, "Purification 
and Characterization of Extracellular Beia 
Galactosidase from Phanerochaeie 
Chrysosporium." 

"I think that it's going to be a great 
experience," said Heniser,

ly climbed the ladder within the 
group and has become an irreplace- 
able employee. 

"1 really think thai working in a 
small business environment has a lot 
more bcnefils than ii has downfalls," 
said Buuck. "You get a lot closer to 
the people that you work with." 

Buuck is a working woman with 
a family. She and her husband, Troy, 
just had their firsi child, Kiley, a few 
months ago. 

She is also very glad dial tax 
season is officially over. 

Now she has more lime to spend

to me as she is an employee, since 
she staned here as a co-op student 
while at Snider High School," stated 
Bill Lewis, president and Chief 
Executive Officer of Lewis CPA 
Group. 

Buuck is not only an accountant, 
she is also the Group's office man-

During tax season she helps with 
taxes, but thai is just an add-on to the 
mtany duties dial her job includes.

Well, another school year is 
coming to a close ai IPFW- Wc"ve 
seen il all this year, havcn'l we? 
Crazy folks calMn' in bomb ihreats 
and even crazier siiualions including 
stealing files, violating NCAA regu- 
lations and creating 
a poisoned atmos- 
phere on our cam- 



pus. 



The 

Administration 

can sit back in 

their seats 

because we 

aren't going to 

drudge up all 

their antics 



, I h e 
Administration can 
sit back in their scats 
because we aren't 
going to drudge up 
all their antics from 
the past year. Bui, 
wearegoing to wish 
atl the graduates 
"Congralulaiions!" 

We have a few 
lucky individuals on 
staff who are finding 
themselves ai the 

staning gaies for Ihc f .u - 

"Real World." And"^ irom tnc pdil 
we are more than vp;ir 

positive they will ycai. 

fmish the race and 
we don't even care how they place. 

We tliougbi we wopid give a lit- 
tle advice to the graduates as they 
make they way into the fuiure. 

1. Hold no regrets, ever. It's a 
waste of emotions Whatever it is it's 
already done and over, you can't 
change it, deal and move on. 

2. Manners, manners, manners. 
This will lake you faither then you 



3. As much as we hate to admit 
il, our mothers were right; If you 
don't have anything nice to say then 
don'i say anything at all. This will 
help alleviate burning any bridges 
you might need in die future 

4. Buck the system 
when you gel the 
chance. This will keep 
you young and the 
rebel alive in you. 

We didn't want to 
leave out the young- 
sters here ai IPFW so 
here is a bit of advice 
for them as well. 

1. RELAX! Your 
college career does not 
hinge on any single 
test grade! When you 
graduate and go in for 
thai all important job 
interview no one is 
going to ask why you 
received an "F" on 
your French hisiroy 
mid-tenn. If they do, 
run, run very, very 



fast! 

We've had a great year and a lot 
of fun here at The Cotnmunicator 
and we would like to thank all of our 
readers for picking up a copy of us 
every week. We do it all for you! 

Our siaH would also Lke to thank 
all of those who have participated in 
our publication throughout the year. 
We can't do this without you, the stu- 
dents, backing us and we have 




[night imagine. "Please" and "thank appreciated all of you who have done 

you" aren't spoken loo often any- so. Remember... Ibis is YOUR siu- 

more. "Ma'am" and "sir" even less. dent newspaper! 

What happens when you work things out?

"Human improvement is from with-

It is absolutely amazing what 
can be accompbshed when you iry 
to make a difference. Last week. I 
was. if you recall, "livid" about the 
proposed budget cuts that the 
Student Senate was planning for 
student organizations. 

1 asked our elected representa- 
tives to consider the consc()uences 
of their impending actions before 
making a decision. Lo and behold, a 
ray of sunshine, in the guise of a 
very interested Senate, broke 
through the clouds. 

Pnor to this, 1 decided lo high- 



tail my little patooiy over to the 
Senate to discuss this problem 
After an initial "talking-match" 
wiih one senator I was invited to a 
budget meeting that was lo be held 
the next day. 

Four of our senators appeared at 
this meeting, and I look it upon 
myself to make them understand 
why culling our budget was a bad, 
bad, bad idea. I listened lo them 
explain what they had to pay for and 
why ihey had to cul ibis or thai. 

1 learned some interesting 
things: ihey were basing their pro- 
posed cuts to The Communicaiof on 
erronenous facts. I quickly corrcct- 
cd these facts, and gave them 
irrefuiable reasons for why they 
should reconsider their choices. In 
essence, i just gave them the facts 
and told them to think about the 
consequences of iheir actions more 
thoroughly. 

And ya' know what folks, it was 
a rousing success. 1 have renewed 
faith in the Student Senate Four 



mtmtK'p, Kx&lt;k the time to listen to 
me Antl ki mi: defend my points 
about the importance of having a 
siudeni newspaper 1 was way 
impressed. 

They not only listened to me, 
but actually considered my 
requests. They also lei me watch 
them in action, and voice my opin- 
ions about dieir proposed changes 
10 the working budget. In other 
words, diey actually lei me have a 
hand in this decision. Some of this 
money in question is mine, after all. 

So far, ihe budget seems to be in 
a good place. I must commend the 
Senate for taking the time to listen 
to my concerns. Thanks especially 
to Jeff, Nick, Abdul and Chuck for 
their diligence and hard work lo do 
what is right with the students' 
money, 1 hope to develop a great 
working relationship in the next 
year. Let's keep up ihe good work, 
guys, I appreciate il. Thanks for 
renewing my faiih in "the system."

Let it be said- 



The CoM.MtJNiCATOR extends a sincere 
welcome to any and nil members of the 
student body who are interested in work- 
ing for IPFW's student newspaper. We 
3JB looking ftff students widi diverse 
backgrounds and from all naajors to par- 
ticipate in all sections of the paper. 
Experience is not iteccssary. Whether 
you are a writer, artist, photographer, or 
have an opinion about something, be 
assured that your panJcipation will bo 
appreciated and will make a difference. 



To ihe Editor: 

First, lei me start off by saying 
that I am not surprised that the 
Coimnupicator is being. lhreaier(eij 
by the Student Senate in wanting to 
reduce the funding. Every year thai 
the Senate budget is laid out. the 
Communicator is usually the first 
one who takes a hit. 

Fortunately, the Senate can 
only recommend iheir budget and 
il is up 10 the administration on 
how the .students money is handed 
out. The adminisiraiion will not cut 
the Cotnmunicator's funds. This 
goes to my second concern. 

As many of you don't know, 
thu administration holds a tight 
lease on bow the students spend 
their own money. 

Mr, Westrick's article last 
week proved that point. I would 
have loved lo attend a beer drink- 
ing party. Yet the atlminLstraiion 
said no. 

As 1 said before, the adminis- 
tration gives the final approval, or 
more likely disapproval, of the 
IPSGA budget. Thus, dictating 
how we spend our own money. 



Lei us look at how the admin- 
istration deals with issues involv- 
ing the students and IPSGA. 

1. The student Senate passed a 
resolution ^slating, that Ihe new 
parking garage would iTCUer suit 
the student's needs if it was built 
on the south side of the campus. 
Where is the garage being built? 

2. Lasi year the student Senate 
voted not to support the flat student 
parking fee. Yet are we not paying 
a flat fee: no mailer if you drive or 
walk? 

3. The Senate passed a resolu- 
tion condemning the current 
rollerblading rules. But where is 
the only place to blade on this cam- 
pus? 

4. The administration cut a five 
year deal with the Pepsi company 
to be the only supplier of soft 
drinks on the campus. Why 
weren't the students involved with 
this decision? 

How has the administration 
used IPSGA? 

When the tech fee was put 
before the students, less than three 
percent of die entire student popu- 
lation approved of this measure. 



yet we are paying this fee. 

We were told that the old com- 
puter lab fees would be phased out. 
yet they are still around, hidden in 

, thai.all, inclusive billing statement. 

We were told that new labs 
would be opened, yet only one lab 
with 29 new computers has been 
installed within the three years that 
this fee has been around. 

The powers that be have been 
here a long time and know that the 
students come and go every year. 
This is why they can get away with 
"theft" of student funds and opin- 
ion. 

These reasons are why I 
believe that die current IPSGA 
Student Senate is obsolete. The 
only good thing going for IPSGA 
is the Student Activities Board. 

Of course that is if the admin- 
istration stays out of it.

IPFW Student 



Powell; not all that he is cracked up to be 



To the Editor: 

The quickest and surest way to 
gain fame and fortune in these 
United States is to kill somebody, 
the more the beiiet. This explains 
die hero worship of Colin Powell 
His recent appearance at IPFW 
garnered a front page review and 
such gushing commentary as 
"The image of IPFW has been 
enhanced by bis appearance in 
Fort Wayne." by Butch Perchan of 
the Athletic department. Not sur- 
prising coming from that depart- 
ment since in America violence 
and spons are virtually the same 
thing with the same purpose — 
entertain the masses. 

Who could ever forget the 
blazing spectacle of Mr Powell's 
war, with ihe networks and CNN 
providing spectacular pictures 
with sparkling play-by-play. The 
"smart" bombs found their targets 
with ease, making lots of noise in 
the process. Never mind that the 



of America is about fifty times the 
size of Iraq, roughly the size of the 
Slate of Colorado. 

Now, I ask you, who couldn't 
lead troops to victory with those 
kind of odds? And what does it say 
about the character of a people 
who finds such joy in being a 
bully? If you were lo lead a gang 
of eighdi graders in a raid against 
first graders on die playground, 
would your friends inake you a 
hero for beating them up? 

Il's Ihe American way. 
WANE-TV sometime around the 
Gulf War, featured guns and uni- 
forms at Soudilown Mall for kids 
to look at and touch, WKJG-TV 
sponsored Powells speech. That's 
not surprising either since 
American media is little more than 
a cheerleader for American values 
of wealth and power and contempt 
for the poor and downtrodden. 



America learned the lesson of 
Viet Nam well: never attack a 
country with such bad manners as 
to fight back Hence Grenada, 
Panama and Iraq. 

Look at the man this city is 
named for Anthony Wayne com- 
mitted genocide against a race of 
people and his punishment was to 
gel a city named after him. 

I could name 100 more exam- 
ples but why bother? I don't even 
know why I waste my lime writing 
at all. li's like Holden says in 
"Catcher in die Rye" about when 
he sees die "F' word written in 
public. Tie wants lo go around and 
erase them lo protect the inno- 
cence of the children but there are 
so many "F" words he knows ii's 
hopeless. 

He got that right.

What's weak this week: DennisDondhOe 



What's nol weak? A litlle of ihis. a Utile of ihai I 
guess. It's nol all bad. I mean really, can I slay nega- 
tive all of Ihe lime? Anyway, il is lime forme logeion 
my soapbox and express what 1 think is good In ihe 



Farley, same age as Qelushi, same lifestyle, same 
tragedy. I haven't ever really left the show. The past 
few seasons they have added a great new, young cast 
and some hilarious new characters. If you havcn'i seen 
It, ('cause you were out partying) check it out again. 



world. I always seem to piss a few of you off. which is The Cheerleaders, Goal Boy. Mr Peppers, Delicious 
healthy. I don't iry to be an ass; 1 just have different " ' " ^ ■• ^ - • ...._.._ 

opinions than you do. So relax, finals are next week. 

Let's start with Iclcvision, this should be easy. 
Who doesn't watch "Seinfeld"? This show is so weird. 
Il took me a while to get used to it, but now I never 
miss it. Only three mofe shows. I remember when 
"M*A*S*H" went off the air, then "Cheers." 
"Seinfeld" is different; it always appears to be a show 
about nothing. Well, that's just il, except for the fact 
that il is a show about evcrylhing. Only those who 
watch it. get it. and that is the best pan of the show. I'm 
sure going to miss it. Any "Seinfeld" panics planned? 

How about "The Daily Show," shown on Comedy 
Central? Monday through Thursday at 10 p.m. 
Nothing is sacred on this half-hour comedic slant at 
world news. The Pope, Jews, whites, blacks, gays, you 



Dish. Mary Catherine Gallagher and the other 
Nightclub Guys, are just some of the reoccuning skits. 
Pretty funny stuff 

"Howard Stem" on El Monday through Friday, at 
10 p.m., and then again at 1 a.m. Not for the timid or 
some women, unless you can handle jokes about sex- 
ism, racism and sometimes the handicapped. Plus, 
oiher just plain lewd and cruel behavior. Rush 
Limbaugh is more offensive dian Howard if you ask 
me. Remember, it is called a "sense of humor," a sense 
of what you think is futmy. Siem is offensive, and 
yeah, he is a pig, but I don't take it seriously. When 
you watch the first ten seconds, you'll know if it is for 
you. 

1 also watch a lot of "Nick at Nile." Some classic 
shows from the sixties, seventies and eighties. I think 



"Dateline NBC." "48 Hours" and "Primetimc 
Live" educate people on how not to be ripped off. 
Sure, magazine-type television shows can be boring 
and sometimes misleading, but they train Americans 
not to trust anyone. They son of show the "real world" 
at its best. 1 like to know which companies are taking 
advantage of the public. I like to know if eggs and 
meat arc being mishandled. I like lo see if politicians 
aren't doing the jobs they were a.sked to do. It makes 
me uncomfortable, but it also makes me aware. 

Well, that's it for this week. Hopefully, I intro- 
duced you to some new TV. I also want to say "Good 
Luck" in your finals next week. This has been an inter- 
esting year for all of us. Bomb threats, parking prob- 
lems, adminisiraiive problems, you name it, this paper 
coveted it. 



I'm not really a part of the Communicator staff; in 
fact, I'm a SPEA major. All I have to do is come up 
with some stuff every once in a while. They have been 
nice enough to give me the privilege to he a small pan 
of their team. But these guys work pretty hard to bring 
all of us weekly coverage of the small planet we call 
IPFW. They should be appreciated. 

I also wont to say "Congratulations" to all of the 
graduating members of 1998 and especially, to my 
dear friends and drinking buddies. We've all been 
through a lot in the past three years, and now, you can 
finally be set free. I have a year left: I'm right behind 
you. You guys are the greatest. I'm really going to miss 
all of you Okay, I'm done., .Good luck and Godspeed.

have a sense of humor, give it a spin. No gimmicks. 
just real, flagrant, hardcore comedy. If you can't laugh 
at all of the bad news, it would be hard to wake up 
every morning. 

And yes, I still watch "Saturday Night Live." 
When Belushi died, il was a huge bummer. He was 
already in Hollywood, but he was an alumnus. His 
tragic death could have been avoided. Then we lose 



Newcomer, continued from page 1 



Smce her last relcLse, "My 
Father's Only Son," Newcomer's 
critically acclaimed career has 
leapt forward with a great 
ase in radio airplay, press 
coverage and record sales. 

One of three girls. Newcomer 
became the self-described 
tomboy character' in her youth, 
n a sense becoming the son her 
father never had. 

She quietly began blazing her 
own trail for years. 

As a musician, Newcomer 
created a solid fan base all over 
the country-. 

In 1997,' she captivated audi- 
ences as the opening act for 
Alison Krauss and Union 
Station's European and U.S. 
touri. 

After forming the Carrie 



Newcomer Band, she completed 
her own tours of Europe. Alaska, 
Canada and most of the 48 con- 
tiguous siaics- 

Down-to-earlh Newcomer 
has played in many bars and 
bowling alleys, and has also land- 
ed gigs at Carnegie Hall and 
London's Royal Festival Theater. 

She seems to put an emphasis 
on her work, laiher than on her 
sunoundings 

Newcomer's work is more 
than a musical diary. The stones 
arc about universal truths that 
touch all people in some way. 

"I believe our liVes are made 
up of litlle aas of bravery and 
great leaps of faith," Newcomer 
said. 



Moore." 1, also, like "Taxi," "The Wonder Years" and 
"Odd Couple." I think it's a generation thing, but these 
shows were just better than today's shows There is no 
argument here. Better acting, writing, less sex and vio- 
lence, just funnier Check out "Nick at Nite." it's good 
TV. 

I don't watch a lot of spons. Mosdy baseball, col- 
lege football and college baskeiball, not the NBA! I'll 
watch the hockey playoffs on ESPN 2. 
We now have the "Golf Channel" in 
Fon Wayne, 

First of all, watching golf on TV has 
to be the most boring thing to do in the 
world. They should show just the golf- 
ing channel in our pri.son system, I 
guarantee crime will drop all over the 
country, who wants to go back to jail 
and have to watch this all day long? Il 
would be tike watching paini dry, if 
you know what I mean, 

"Dennis Miller Live" on HBO, 
Fridays at 10:30 p.m. and replayed on 
Sundays, is also some greai commen- 
lary on American stupidity. If you 
don't get HBO. you are really missing 
some sman comedy. If you don't think 
he's funny, you probably don't get it. It 
means he's talking about you. You'll 
catch. up someday.'be patient, ,

All about marijuana 



Student continues education 
jsuccessfully after accident 



; By Joan Poulsen 

Staff Whiter 

As many siudents would agree, 
engineering is considered one of ihe 
imosl challenging curricula in col- 
lege. 

It involves physics, maLh and 
more delailed classes depending 
'■ on ihe speciaiizaiion. For civil cngi- 
ineering lecbnology {Q;l"). which 
deals wilh structures not intended 
for human occupation (bridges, 
sewer tunnels, etc.) this curriculum 
at IPFW includes Ihe class CET 108. 
It involves surveying, and is a 
iiequiremeni for a CET degree. 
; Now, imagine being required lo 
perform outdoor surveys for this 
'.class without the ability lo walk, 
; How would you transport your- 
;sclf around the rugged and bumpy 
terrain? 

A wheelchair, your usual mode 
,of transportation . is dirficull to 
'maneuver over ruts, holes, rocks 
land mud. This act of gelling to the 
!survey site alone becomes very 
tedious, if nw impossible. 

One student, Bill Doison, has 
! found a way lo deal wilh this extra 
;challenge. He uses a riding lawn- 
|inower to move around his assigned 
i survey sile.j.,iv_v.v 

Dotson 'fcwV. "te would have 
Iproblems mofing'^ound dii'flie' 
'rough land to do bis surveying. 
iAfier discussing this problem with 
;ihe staff of IPFWs Services for 
;Sludents with Disabilities, they 
came up with the idea of using a rid- 
ding lawnmower for him to ride on to 
;move around outside. 
: This idea makes perfect sense 
'After all, a riding lawnmower is 
[designed to be driven over grassy. 




d c a 
worked well for 
Doison. Since he 
loves the outdoors, he also uses his 
riding lawnmower when he goes 
fishing and, of course, to mow the 
lawn. 

Aside from his mode of trans- 
portation. Dotson says his method' 
of surveying is now different from 
the other students in his class. 

Doison, who is working towards 
the completion of his associate 
degree in civil engineering technol- 
ogy, lost the use of his legs in a car 
accident. 

In 1993, he worked.as-aiieavy 
equipment oper'aibr.^This^ob 
demanded 90-hour work weeks 
from him for an extended time. 
Doison added ihat he had a three- 
hour commute to work every day. 



On July 25, 1993. he pushed himself 
too far. On the drive home from vis- 
iting friends ihat Saturday. DoLson 
says he fell asleep al Ihe wheel and 
crashed. He broke his back, leaving 
him a paraplegic. 

As time went on, he has amaz- 
'ingly recovered some capabilities. 
Dotson is now able lo feel touch or 
pressure on his legs, though he siill 
cannot feel pain or temperature dif- 
ferences (hot and cold). He also can 
stand up on his own now. 

Currcnily, Dotson has three 
classes to complete lo earn his asso- 
ciate degree in CET, 

His biggesi decision now is 
whedierhe should continue his edu- 
cation lo obtain his bachelors degree 
in CET, or to accept one of ihe job 
offers he has already received. 

Dotson seemed anxious to 
return lo ihe workforce. Since his 
accident his main income has been 
disability social security, mostly so 
he can focus on his education. 

Bui EHitson also values his train- 
ing and is considering going for his 
four-year degree. 

Dotson 's positive altitude has 
helped him cope with the challenges 
of his major and ihc loss of the use 
of his legs. 

Whether he decides to take a job 
noWj or 10 continue and get his 
bachelors degree, no doubt his 
determination and attitude will lead 
him to success.

What i 
Marijuana? 

Marijuana is 
made from the hemp 
plant (Cannabis sati- 
va). The leaves. 
stems, and flowenng 
tops of die plant are 
dried and smoked in 
cigarettes ("joints") 
or in pipes. Marijuana 
also can be ingested. 
Chemically, mari- 
juana is complex. The 
main psychoactive 
chemical in marijuana is "tetrahy- 
drocannabinol" (TUC). 

Marijuana is unique among the 
psychoactive drugs, in a class by 
tself. Within 20 minutes of smok- 
ng, marijuana can induce (depend- 
ng on strength) a sedating elTcct in 
which the user may become drowsy 
or feel mentally separated from the 
environment. 

What happens to marijuana 
inlhcbi&gt;d&gt;? 



When marijuana is smoked, iw Marijuana smoke contains more ■ 
chemicals pass through the lungs cancer causing agents than tobacco 
and into the bloodstream. Then diey smoke. Continued long term use can 
diminish the body's ability to fight 
disease. 

Also, because THC is stored in 
the brain and reproductive organs, 
these organs arc especially likely to 
be damaged. In men. 
long-term use can lower 
testosterone and sperm 
levels. In women, long- 
term use can cause men-

By Adam Tayloh 
Staff WfUTEfl 

Too awake lo sleep, John 
awoke wiih the sun feeling unusual- 
ly lircd. On nonnal days, the sun 
would offer a feeling of comfori, 
bui for some reason, loday didn't 
feel normal. 

He would be graduaiing college 
in two days and the following week 
would find him on foreign soil, 
starting a new job in Pennsylvania. 

Pennsylvania was a far cry from 
Ihe far more relaxed life of 
Kcniueky, or so ii seemed to him. 
He'd spent his whole life thinking 
thai. 

After laying in bed for a half an 
hour, he finally resolved lo make 
(he best of such an early start and 
walk down to the river for some 
fishing. 

!i seemed lo be all he enjoyed 
these day as all of his friends were 
ofT planning their lives, himself 
included. 

His mother had been gone five 
yeai^, succumbing 10 cancer and his 
father was too involved with his bw 
practice to notice he's around half 
of the lime. He didn't even notice 
passing him in the ball on his way 



to ihe garage to get the bail. 

John soon forgot about his 
detached relationship with his 
fadier as he walked calmly down lo 
the river. 

Everyihing in nature seemed to 
be in sync ihai day. The birds 
chirped, communicating lo their 
young it was time for breakfast. The 
sun smiled down on the Rowers it 
had raised, promising a beautiful 
day as the blue reflected the warmth 
of the future. 

No mailer how solid John's 
tumultuous feelings were inside, 
ihey were soon dis- 
pelled as he sal 
down la bail his 
line. 

After palicnily 
wailing for a bite for 
an hour, John heard 
the familiar 
boom of 




father's voice echo, "How ihcy 
biiin'?" all around him. 

Half-iuming towards Ihe house, 
John saw his father walking toward 
him down the bank with his tried- 
and-irue fishing pole John's grand- 
father had given him when he was 
John's age. 

"I've had a few bites, but noth- 
ing's really going for it," John casu- 
ally replied. 

"Well, sounds like your worm 
might need to polish its people 
skills," John's dad said as he look a 
seal next to his son 

John's father grabbed a worm 
from die bucket and bailed his hook 
as the two men sat in silence. 
Finally, after wailing for what 
seemed like forever, he 
spoke up. "So. graduating 
in a couple days, huh? You 
be nervous." 
'No not really. It's just 
another day for me, real- 
ly" 
"You know what 
m. son. 1 still 
remember bow bad 
1 was for me mov- 
away and starting 
my own life Ii took a 
bile for me lo gel used to 



John acknowledged his father's 
story by checking his line, making 
sure that his worm hadn't been 
stolen while he wasn't paying atlen- 
lion Sure enough, he found an 
emply hook. 

John's father chuckled as his 
son's misfortune and stood up. 
handing his pole to John. "Here. I'd 
better get ready for work soon any-

gram without the constant coniribu- 
lions that he has made over the last 
couple of years?

This team has broughi the program 
out of ihc cellar and made it a force 
lo be reckoned with in the GLVC. 
Mens Cross Country: 
Adam Barlon: He worked every day 
lasi summer to improve and he did.

Kelli Kunkel: She transferred to this 
team from Tri-Staie and quickly 



c^tabll^hed herself as the best run- 
ner on the team. 

Womens Volleyball: Dottie 

Porch: She led the team with power 
and grace thai makes her a special 
alhleie. 

Mens Basketball: Adam 

Moore: There were times during die

the basket with two and three play- 
ers trying to take off his head, bul he 
showed die guL'i to lake die punish- 
ment and keep on playing. 

Womens Basketball: Leah
