Cane: if you want something 
done, do it yourself 



By TOMMY FRANKE 

"I guess if you want anything 
done, you have to do it yourself." 

With those words. Rusty Cane 
explained why he decided to run for 
the office of student body president in 
the upcoming General Elections. 

Cane will be running on the 
Un-Party ticket. The rest of the ticket 
has not been announced yet, although 
Tom Johnson may be running for 
vice-president. 

Johnson's eligibility to run is now 
being disputed because he is not a 
full-time student. 

Cane said that their party is 
called the Un-Party because "we're 
not a bunch of politically-thriving 
students. We're just out to help 
ourselves and all other students 



administration to work on if elected. 

He mentioned the Professional 
Practices Program, a system in 
which students may work and earn 
class credits at the same time. "It 
(the PPP) has great potential here in 
Fort Wayne with all the local 
industry." 

He also said that more student 
input in decision-making is needed. 
"The administration feels that this 
campus is theirs, but it really is the 
students'." 

Concerning the paid parking 
situation he said, "I don't feel it is 
right to have free parking for 
everybody. However, if we do pay for 
it, we do have to get, for example, the 
B lot fixed." 

He then said, "we (the party) are 
definitely in support of the day Care 
center." He noted the fact that 
changes need to be made there 
because of the financial problems that 
plague the center. 

Cane remarked that he plans t 



sity or something like that. The name 
of the school is important, I think." 

"Many problems do exist with the 
two universities. For example, the 
problem of enrolling in a class that 
you'd really like to take but you can't 
because you're enrolled in the wrong 
university. That definitely has to be 
changed." 

"But as far as changing this 
university to one university, I feel 
that would hurt the school right now." 

Cane noted that the only criticism 
that he has regarding the past 
students' government is that too often 
its members have given up too soon. 
He said there was a lack of strength, 
saying that the students had ended up 
on the weak side when trying to work 
with faculty and administration. 

Cane is a junior majoring in 



when he was a freshman. 

He has been a member of the 
Student Union Board since the spring 
of 1972, and vice-president of that 
group this school year. 



The resolution stated that the 
possibility of work stoppages on this 
campus was immenent By a vote of 
63 to 11, the faculty voiced its position 
that the university was not providing 
enough money to stay even in the race 
with inflation. 

Sources close to the faculty again 
stressed that the term "work 
stoppage" does not mean that they 
will leave class rooms except as a last 
resort. The first possibility outlined 
by the source will probably be a 
ceasation of submitting papers for 
publication by the faculty. 

It was also stressed that the 
faculty has not yet voted to stop work, 
The purpose rather, was to alert the 
University administration of faculty 
dissatisfaction with their pat in- 
creases. A reasonable length of time 
will be given by the faculty to allow 
the university a chance to grant the 

If no increases are forthcoming, 
the faculty will then vote again on the 
issue of actually calling the work 
stoppage, and will probably decide at 
that time how comprehensive the 
stoppage should be. 

The major faculty demand is a 
request that the University grant 
increases equal to the rise in the cost 
of living. According to Clifford Scott,

Charles Pratt, candidate for presi- 
dent of the st ident body on (he 
Alliance for a Campus Together 
(ACT) ticket, feels that students' 
government should not be merely a 
student political institution. "It 
should he a student service organiza- 
tion," he said. 

He also said, "One of the most 
important goals is the restructuring 
of the students' government so that it 
is more efficient. In the past it has 
been very hard for a student to gel 
real concrete information from the 
students* government office," 

"It seems thai the past students' 
governments have t

In assessing the past administra-

groundwork that is necessary for

The University of Notre Dame 
will host a conference for Indiana 
faculty, Saturday April 6, on "Tenure 
Problems in Indiana Universities." 
Sponsored by the Federation of 
Indiana Chapters of the American 
Association of University Professors, 
the tenure conference will feature 
practical methods by which univer- 
sity faculties may deal with current 
attacks being made on tenure. 

Stephen Harroff, professor of the 
Modern Foreign Language depart- 
ment at IU-PU, is to be a member of 
one of three faculty panels which will 
discuss tenure problems. Tenure is 
regarded by most faculty as a 
long-fought-for principle which pro- 
tects academic freedom in the 
classroom and economic justice for 
faculty. The panels will deal basically 
with tenure quotas, how to maintain 
both affirmative action programs and 
the vitality of tenure, and criteria and

Featured speaker at the day-long 
conference in the Notre Dame 
Continuation Center will be Walter 
Adams, professor of Economics at 
Michigan State University and cur- 
rent president of the American 
Association of University Professors. 
Adams maintains that higher educa- 
tion is not bound by any "guiding 
power of the unseen hand," and that 
consequently the current plateau in

and the broader society. Adams 
points out that changes in state and 
national funding of education and 
active efforts to provide all 
Americans with quality education 



would solve the currenl tenure crisis. 
Harroff on the Panel of Tenure 
Quotas is bringing to the conference 
the views of younger members of the 
faculty. "I will stress that I am a 
faculty member at the junior rank at 
an institution that is comprised 
mostly of a younger faculty. There

instructors: a sort of landed gentry 
and another group that would be in

Harroff stresses the importance 
of tenure to the university commun- 
ity. "The basic idea of tenure goes far 
beyond the question of job security. 
Tenure guarantees academic free- 
dom and academic life in the 
university community." 

Concerning the question that 
tenure causes a static faculty, Dr. 
Harroff comments, "I don't think that 



tenure would limil new ideas corning 
into a university. There will always be 
movement in Ihe academic commu- 
nity. It's not granting a member the 
nature of professional obligation to 
assume that he'll sit back and rest on

Faculty request candidate question time 



By REX PUTT 

The Indiana Faculty Senate 
passed a resolution Tuesday after- 
noon expressing the desire that the 
last session on the second day of 
super-chancellor interviews be clear- 
ly designated for all faculty. The 
period that begins at 2:30 p.m. should 
be extended for faculty participation. 

This resolution was initially 
suggested by Roy W. Richards, Jr. 

Richards acknowledged that the 
faculty has had little opportunity to 
become involved in the interviews, 
which are scheduled to begin April 
9th. He pointed out that there are over 
250 professors at IU-PU, and as it 
stands now, a very small percentage 
of them are representatives in the 
interviewing procedures. 

He intimated that the students of 
the University were much better 
represented than the faculty. 

The only active participation by 
the total faculty was the request for 
questions for the interviews. A 



number of questions will be chosen for 
the interviewing procedures, with the 
emphasis on the key issues. 

Gene D. Phillips, a member of the 
Search and Screen Committee, which 
had narrowed the 244 applicants to 
seven, agreed with the proposal 
presented by Richards. Phillips said, 
"They (the applicants) will probably 
be judged on the basis of whether or 
not they want access to the faculty. 
How each man spends his interview- 
ing time should tell the faculty 
something." 

Richards stated that the faculty 
would like to have priority in speaking 
with applicants during the open 
periods at the time of the interviews. 

Several faculty members ex- 
pressed their concern over the lack of 
information released to the faculty 
concerning the applicants. However, 
one faculty member informed the 
faculty Senate that a memorandum 
containing a one-page biography on 
each applicant was being circulated 
Wednesday. This information will be 



memorandum is to acquaint the 
faculty more fully with the history of 
the applicants for the super-chancel- 
lor position. 

Thomas L. Guthrie, Michael 
Downs, and Gerald G. Szymanski, 
were elected by members of the 
Indiana Faculty Senate at Fort 
Wayne to represent the Indiana 
Faculty Senate in the interviews. 
John P. Bell and Virginia R. Craig 
were voted as alternates. 

Phillips asserted that the faculty 
members are responsible for the task 
of information giving as well as 
information gathering. 

He also noted that there would be 
no additional applicants named if one 
of the present six decided to 
withdraw. Dr. Stanley B. Kegler, 
vice-president for administration of 
the University of Minnesota, and one 
of the original seven applicants, has 
already withdrawn. 



diplomas." 

Pratt would like to see parking fees 
abolished, but says that he can't 
reasonably promise that his admini- 
stration would do away with them. He 
did say, however, that this topic 
should be one of the highest on the list 
of things that should be investigated 
by next year's administration. 

ACT is sponsoring an open forum 
Friday in the first floor lounge of the 
Student Union in order to get student 
imput on what the party should stand 
for. Pratt remarked, "We will be 
requesting imput from students on

ment should be.

Student election campaigns 

When classes resume in a week following spring break, students can 
expect to be hit with large volumes of campaign propaganda urging each 
to vote for this party or that party in the student elections which will be 
held April 16 and 17. 

There will be only one and one-half weeks of campaigning time left 
when the break ends. This will make the campaign efforts of both sides 
quite intense. 

The campaign promises to be belter than last year's, when the 
incumbent Alliance for a Better Campus and Brock Able faced only 
scattered opposition with no formal party organization. 

This year, however, the ABC has split in two. The incumbents are 
running on two separate tickets. No outside opposition has surfaced. 

There does not appear to be any great difference in philosophy 
between the two parties at this time. The ABC split seems only to be a 
manifestation of the personality problems that have plagued the 
Students' Government all year. 

Although neither party has announced its entire slate of candidates, 
one can expect both tickets to be built around qualified people with 
histories of service to the student body. 

Wise student voters will find it advantageous to split their votes 
between parties. An election sweep by either party will exclude some 
very good people from the other party. 

The two presidential candidates, Charlie Pratt and Rusty Cane, 
possess the minimum qualifications to hold the job. Their relative 
strengths and weaknesses will be discussed in later editorials. 

Once the full tickets of both parties are announced, it will be easier to 
assess the significant differences, if any, between the two slates of 
candidates. The party platforms should also shed some light on the great 
issues of the day, if there will be any of those for a change. 

The responsibility will lie with the voter for distinguishing between 
the two slates and platforms. This newspaper will do what it can in the 
next couple of weeks to aid the student body in making these decisions. 



By FAMIOUS WILLIAMS 

There are those people in the 
world who object to agitation and one 
cannot wholly blame them. Agitation 
after all is unpleasant. It means that 
while you are going on peaceably and 
joyfully on your way some half-mad 
person insists upon saying things that 
you do not like to hear. They may be 
true but you do not like to hear them. 
You would rather wait till some 
convenient season; or you take up 
your newspaper and instead of finding 
pleasant notices about your friends 
and the present progress of the world, 
you read of some restless folks who 
insist on talking about wrong and 
crime and unpleasant things. It would 
be much better if we did not have to 
have agitation; if we had a world 
where everything was going so well 
and it was unnecessary often to 
protest strongly, even wildly, of the 
evil and the wrong of the universe. 

As a matter of fact, however, no 
matter how unpleasant the agitator 
is, and no matter how inconvenient 
and unreasonable his talk, yet we 
must ever have him with us. And 
why? Because this is a world where 
things are not all right. We are gifted 
with human nature which does not do 
the right or even desire the right 
always. So long as these things are 
true, then we are faced by this 
dilemma; either we must let the evil 
alone and refuse to hear of it or listen 
to it or we must try to right it. Now, 
very often it happens that the evil is 
there, the wrong has been done, and 
yet we do not hear of it-we do not 
know about it. Here then comes the 
agitator. He is the hera)d-he is the 



MONEY MATTERS 

Silver rising fast 



By CARL W. BITTER 

Less than a year ago the price of 
silver was hovering around $1 .98 to $2 
San ounce. By June of 1973, it had 
climbed to $2.85 an ounce. Now it is 
around $4 an ounce Will it goto$5 this 
-y«ar? Or even higher? 

The "yes" arguments are 
impressive. 

One big reason for the positive 
view is the fact the government is 
permitting the price to find its own 
level in a free market. Time and 
again in recent years the government 
stepped in and made silver sales from 
its stockpile, keeping the price down. 
It may be said the government acted 
in good conscience, because this 
action helped Silver Users Associa- 
tion members, who presumably 
enabled the public to benefit down the 



speculation 
relating to it in any form might 
interfere with its proper function in 
coinage. 

Now that our copper clads have 
driven silver coins out of circulation 
in reiteration of Gresham's Law (bad 
money drives out good), the latter 
consideration is rather academic. 

It is still possible, of course, for 
one or two unsettling things to 
happen Unsettling, that is, for the 
millions of Americans who have 
silver coins tucked away. For one, the 
government might call in all silver 
coins, since governments from time 
immemorial have taken less than 
kindly to citizens profitteerling from 
the monetary system through 
hoarding. 

There is a possibility, too, that the 
hoarded silver coins, since they no 
longer effectively relate to their 
original purpose, might be disen- 
franchised. 

They could be proclaimed no 
longer legitimate legal tender. 

Neither of these possibilities is 
anywhere near a probability. 



might be declared illegal, investment 
adviser William F Rickenbacker in 
his book, Wooden Nickels (Arlington 
House) comments on a Treasury 
report: "The report speaks in 
unusually clear tones-"A legal appa- 
ratus effective in dissipating large 
hoards (of silver) would seem almost 
certain to encourage even more 
widespread family accumulations.' " 

Viewing silver, then, essentially 
as a commodity, what is the current 
situation so far as the United States is 
concerned? 

The latest Bureau of Mines report 
shows industrial silver consumption 
in this country last year was around

prophet-he is the man that says to the 
world: "There are evils which you do 
not know, but which I know and you 
must listen to them." Now, of course, 
there may be agitators who are telling 
the truth and there may be agitators 
who are telling untruths. Those who 
are not telling the truth may be lying 
or they may be mistaken. So that 
agitation in itself does not necessarily 
mean always the right and always 
reform. 

Here then is some one who thinks 
that he has discovered some danger- 
ous evil and wants to call the attention 
of good men of the world to it. If he 
does not persevere, we may perhaps 
think that the evil which he thought he 
saw has been cured. But if he is 
sincere and if he is persistent, then 
there is but one thing for a person to 
do who wants to live in a world worth 
living in; that is, listen to him 
carefully, prove his tale and then try 
and right the wrong. 

Let us take, for example, a person 
whom we will call Joe. Joe is 
connected with a midwestern learn- 
ing institution which has a student 
body of over 6,000 and a faculty of 240 
plus. Joe noticed that, on the surface, 
the learning institution tries to create 
the impression that it has a workable 



Affirmative Action Staff, it does, for 
its own purpose, advertize itself as an 
"Equal Opportunity Employer." In 
observing the composition of the 
learning institution, Joe saw that the 
institution's equal opportunity pro- 
gram left much to be desired. For 
example, out of over 240 faculty 
members, only three were Black and 
of those three only one was teaching. 
And he was teaching only on a 
part-time basis. 

In addition to observing that 
Blacks occupied marginal positions, 
Joe noticed that little was being done 
in terms of up-grading or eventually 
bringing Minority group members 
into full-time status commensurate 
with their education and experience. 
He sensed a concerted effort to keep 
Blacks out especially. An illustration 
of this is the fact that the Female 
Caucasian has been classified as a 
minority group thus becoming direct 
competition to the Black male and-or 
female and other minority groups. 
Joe felt this to be quite convenient for 
the majority, but a definite setback 
for the true minority. 

To make a long story short, Joe 
was very much agitated because he 
himself had been subjected to all the 
above setbacks. His pleas for relief 
fell on deaf ears. He was cautioned 
that to fight or agitate would forever 
alienate him with the institution. 
What must he do? What can he do? 
The role of agitator is not a pleasant 
role to play. It is not always pleasant 

coming with dark facts and un- 
pleasant conditions. Nevertheless, it 
is the highest optimism to bring 
forward the dark sioe of any human 
picture. When a man does this he says 
to the world: "Things are bad but it is 
worthwhile to let the world know that 
things are bad in order that they may 
become better. The real crushing 
pessimism takes hold of the world 
when people say things are so bad 
that they are not worth complaining 
of because they cannot be made 

Joe determined that he should 
agitate until a fair and just hearing 
was given to the situation: 

-until the institution hired more 
qualified Blacks to its faculty and 
staff. 

-provided a mean 
part and full-time workers. 

-lay down guidelines for dealing 
with faculty members found guilty of 
discriminatory practices in hiring. 

-setting up a full-time workable 
Affirmative Action Program. 




Let me make this perfectly clear 



U.S. must cope 
with crisis 



Editor's Note: Thi Is the first of two 
articles speculating on how the 
energy crisis will affect the United 
States. 



As the nation approaches its 200th 
birthday, Americans, instead of 
celebrating, are preoccupied with a 
worrisome crisis unparalleled in their 
history. 

The prominent cause of frustra- 
tion is something called an energy 
crisis-a concern that cuts through all 
classes of the population to touch the 
lives of all in a myriad of ways. 

The future outlook for everyone __ 
■was clouded in some way by the 
growing menace. The long-threatened 
energy crunch was on; denial of its 
reality was no longer rational, 
Coming with it were attendant 
horrors, both predictable and uncer- 

One gloomy prospect was a 
recession, accompanied by a sub- 
stantial increase in job losses. 
Another was higher living costs, not 
only from fuel price hikes but also a 
host of products and commodities and 
services linked dependently to oil. 

Still another specter on the 
horizon was a multitude of infringe- 
ments on personal freedom and 
patterns of living and life-styles of 
Americans. 

Another possible negative aspect 
of the crisis was a massive setback in 
the drive to clean up the environment. 

By necessity, drilling would have 
to resume in the leaky Santa Barbara 
Channel; coal and residual oil, laden 
with poisonous sulfur, would have to 
be burned and smog-curbing devices

Is the Spirit World real? Are we 
influenced by unseen beings? And if 
these things do exist, how are we to 
deal with them? Do we have the 
authority or power to effect changes 
upon this invisible world? 

Similar questions have probably 
crossed the minds of nearly everyone 
in the community at sometime in the 

made a very great impact upon 
thousands of people in Fort Wayne 
and upon millions across the country. 
Psychiatrists, ministers, priests 
and counsellors are now hearing more 
accounts of spirit visitations than 
ever before. Since the 25 cents 
national weeklies began featuring 
headlines with the words demons, 
exorcism and possession, their 



j have sky rocketed. And a 

i named Blatty is suddenly an 

international figure, while Billy 
Graham answers questions about the 
reality of Satan. 

If this is more than just mass 
hysteria or the latest craze soon to 
pass, (and the history books indicate 

INDIANA - PURDUE 



&gt; then we need to 
classify the information we've been 
receiving. 

On Saturday, March 30th at 8 
p.m., a panel will meet in the 
Ballroom of the IU-Purdue Student 
Union Building to address the 
question "Is the Spirit World Real?" 
This discussion, 1 hope, will mark the 
beginning of a rational and intelligent 
inquiry. The men who form the panel 
are William R. Durland, director of 
the center for the study of the person 
and an IU-PU philosophy professor; 
Wilfred R. Kent, president of 
Diagnostic and Counselling Services. 
Fort Wayne; and the Rev. Paul E. 
Paino, pastor of Calvary Temple, 
Fort Wayne. Jerry Miller, an IU-PU 
student and writer of this column, will 
serve as moderator. 

Each man will be given 15 



minutes to address the question "Is 
the Spirit World Real?" from his 
professional perspective. The floor 
will then open for questions from the 
audience. I hope as many students, 
professors, and members of the 
community as are able will partici- 
pate in this inquiry. 

"Is the Spirit World Real?" is 
being sponsored by United Christian 
Action, an IU-Purdue student organi- 
zation. A $1.00 donation will be taken 
at the door. 

Additional discussions, lectures, 
and seminars are anticipated in the 
future with the faith that an open 
inquiry will produce needed light on 
this subject. If you have any 
questions, comments, or experiences 
to share bring them to the discussion 
or address them to The Magic Mirror, 
care of The Communicator. 



As to whether the energy crisis is 
good or bad depends on whom you 
talk to. Many think it is a belssing in 
disguise that will eventually not only 
help the individual but the economy 

Gen. William C. Westmoreland, 
retired, former Army chief of staff, 
said recently that he hopes the energy 
crisis will bring us back to some of the 
virtues "that made this country 
great, like thrift and the belief thai 
waste is sinful." 

However, with an increasing 
scarcity of materials, businessmen 
forecast some production losses in the 
future. Lionel D. Eddie and Co., a 
New York investment-counseling 
firm, predicted that even minor 
production losses because of fuel 
shortages could bring a mild 



The far-ranging effects of the 
energy crisis are unknown, but even 
businessmen and industrialists pre- 
dict there will be changes in life-styles 
in the generations to come, and the 
general public may never again enjoy 
expensive frills and luxuries. 

Some of these possible changes, 
include: 

-People bundling up more and 
more in winter as heating will be at a 
premium, firewood will be scarce and 
there will be a federal program 
instituted to provide insulation to 
homes. 

-Many will go to work in car 
pools, and people will be driving in 
smaller cars or traveling on mass 
transit systems. Motorists will have to 
allow longer to get from one point to 
another as speed limits will be 
reduced, while gas prices rise. 

-Families, which often physically 
split apart in the mobile 1960s, may 
join once again and get to know their 
neighbors as they did in the 1950s. 

-A trend to eat at home, more 
nutritionally balanced meals. 

-There will be an increase in the 
use of musical instruments, television 
viewing as well as bowling, tennis, 
swimming and golf. There should be 
less boating and skiing because of fuel 

-There will be a tendency for 
people to move toward their jobs- 
which could be a trend toward 
downtown living-and live in multi- 
family buildings. 

There will also be a change in 
architecture with the use of double- 
glass insulation in homes, especially 
in the East. 

-A new creativity should emerge 
in the clothing and toy industries and 
elsewhere due to a shortage of 
materials. 

-Students in the East may be 
using an extended school term in 



energy problei 

-Men and women will be walking 
and riding bikes to the corner store 
and to work and they will be healthier 
because of it. 

-People will be changing to 
doctors, cleaners, stores which are 
closer to their residences. Use of 
lights and power equipment will be 
kept to a minimum as the crisis of 
1973 will linger in many persons' 
minds. 

Life-style changes are forecase in 
the fields of leisure -recreation, 
products, medicine and education. 

A positive aspect of these changes 

become a way of life. Europeans are 
trained from the cradle to close doors 
behind them to conserve heating 
fuels; now Americans will learn. 



Next: A changing life-style.

A NICE QUIET I 

Whenever you think of the library it is usually as a 
source for some assignment or term paper. It is the site of 
erudition, the 'temple of knowledge." Last week it was also 
for a time, the temple of Eros. 

Susan Sparapani was all alone at the main desk. It was 
high noon, and the rest of the staff was lunching. A little old 
lady flying distress signals rushed up to Susan There was

Knocking on the closed cubicle, she ordered the love 
story to cease and desist. The man was, as Susan wryly 
remarked, in an "indefensible position." but seemed 
disinclined to make an exit. With a calm courage, Mrs. 
Sparapani told him that he and Juliet had exactly five 
minutes in which to disappear, and then she would call the 
Campus Police. For about the total alloted time Lothario 
and the lone librarian engaged in a "staring contest." Came 
a capitulation and a sullen exit by two. 

Like all our great librarians, Mrs. Sparapani sincerely 
strives to fill all requests, even those of panic stricken old

BARBARA KENNEDY verdicted that it was "too long

immediately after she had been studying a while for her

greedy meter double its due so she'd be safe for the 
forthcoming class. Dropping away two dimes, she glanced 
at her clock. 1:10! The class she was studying for was 
almost a has-been. Shrugging her discouragement and 
disbelief, Barb drove away leaving lots of paid-for time for

an on-scene, eye witness report. It was about eleven fifteen 
on that Friday morning, when Kathy Terhune was taking 
the high road up from the library and was on her way to 
Kettler. Thinking deep thoughts, Kathy was suddenly 
conscious of the sound of "panting" behind her. Before she 
could turn around, the streaker pulled from behind and 
passed her. Kathy was startled but not stunned. She is 
positive she does not know WHO, but he was headed for 
Kettler in his skin suit when he vanished from her view.

RAP LINE 



NOW FORT WAYNE CAN'T BE OVERLOOKED 



The Indiana Broadcasters held a convention prior to the 
1974 IHSAA State basketball finals, and during the 
convention the participants (supposedly the best 
broadcasters and reporters in the state) voted for then- 
choice in the state finals. They typically voted 
Jeffersonville, a team that had been in the top five all year, 
as the team to beat with 22 votes. Lafayette Jeff and 
Franklin followed with 12 and 17 votes, while FORT 
WAYNE NORTHROP, the team that had won 24 games in a 
row against "weak opposition" like Anderson, Logansport, 
Penn, Huntington, and Fort Wayne South, among others, 
received a whopping 10 votes. 

Fort Wayne teams have been ignored ever since South 
Side captured the championship in 1958. FORT WAYNE 
NORTHROP was obviously the best team in the 1974 state 
finals, and they proved it. Jeffersonville didn't win state, 
Anderson didn't win it, Lafayette Jeff didn't win it, and 
Franklin didn't win it. FORT WAYNE NORTHROP WON 
IT! ! ! 

Ignored in the rankings until the last few weeks of 
regular season play. FORT WAYNE NORTHROP made 
believers out of the ignorant and prejudiced sports writers 
and broadcasters who have ignored FORT WAYNE for too 
long. 

Two fine Journal-Gazette reporters supported FORT 
WAYNE NORTHROP all the way, but the News-Sentinal 
writers weren't so favorable to their FORT WAYNR team. 

Hopefully, NORTHROP, the third FORT WAYNE 
school to capture the coveted crown has brought home some 
publicity to FORT WAYNE 

Every year the FORT WAYNE hardcourt standouts 
are overlooked for allp-state honors. This year Walter 
Jordan and Mike Muff made the first and second squads ofd

1 STATE FINALS 



Northrop was impressive enough to get the job done in the 
state finals It was a team effort that gained them the 
championship, which they well deserved. Coach Bob Dille 
must be recognized for his fine job of developing a good 
team into a championship team, and needless to say, the 
best high schools team in Indiana. 

In the first game of the state finals Northrop never 
trailed as they disposed of a tough Lafayette Jeff team. 
Walter Jordan paced the Bruin victroy with 26 well earned 
points, as he hit on 13 of 21 shots. Jordan certainly looked to 
me like a fine candidate for Indiana's Mr. Basketball. 

In the nightcap Jeffersonville ea'ised Northrop some 
problems, but nothing that could stop a beautiful team 
effort. 

With forty seconds remaining in the game and Northrop 
leading by only one point, leading scorer Mike Muff pulled 
off an offensive rebound and banked in a beautiful fall away 
jumper. But Jeffersonville came right back to score, when 
Walls, their leadingscorer. grabbed an offensive rebound 
and walked about four steps to score. Northrop got the ball 
down court and held the ball until there were only 21 
seconds left. Jim Wimbley, the Bruins worst free-throw 
shooter with an anemic 36 per cent average for the year, 
was fouled. 

Wimbley stepped up to the line and miraculously 
flicked the ball through the hoop to put Northrop up by two. 
He missed the second shot, but Muff tied up a Jeffersonville 
palyer on the loose ball. Northrop regained control, but 
Wayne Walls, the star of Jeffersonville, tried to shoot up a 
fifteen footer, but threw it off when lanky Maurice Drinks 
completely smothered him on defense. Walter Jordan 
ripped off the rebound and tossed the ball to Madden, who 
was fouled in the process of dribbling out the clock. He went 
to the charity stripe with only two seconds left and his team 
ahead by two points. He calmly hit the first of a one and one 
to put the game out of reach, which assured Northrop of a 
state championship in only their third year of existence. 

In the important last 40 seconds every single member of 
the Northrop live contributed to the victory. This is why 
they were the state champs, and INDEED, the best team in 
the state. 

As an all-star ti 
just the Northrop si 
three schools, I will name Jordon, Madden. Walls of 
Jeffersonville, Bowen of Lafayette and McCarty of 
Franklin. For the second squad, Muff, Wimbly and Drinks 
would be joined by Fields of Lafayette and Meyer of 
Jeffersonville. 

Jordan and Madden are my choices as co-most valuable 
players of the tournament. Jordan scored 46 points and had

Purdue loses only Kendrick next year, so they again

title.

North Carolina State was definitely the Northrop of the
