First student graduates 
from leadership class 



BySTACEYSCHAAB 
Staff Writer 

On Dec. 2, 1986, Sludenl body 
president Joseph Motherwell 
graduated from Leadership Fort 
Wayne as the first student graduate. 

Leadership Fort Wayne was started 
in 19U2 as a joint project of Indiana- 
Purdue University and the Corporaie 
Council. Its purpose is to identify a 
broadly representative group of 
promising persons who have shown a 
capacity for voluntary leadership, to 
train them in a variely of areas of local 
concern, and lo encourage networking 
among them and the current leadership 
of Ihe community. 

The class of 1996 is the largest and the 
most diverse one yet. It brings together 

some odd couples: manufacturing and 



labor, government and the not-for- 
profit sector, educators and the media, 
health care and the arts, finance and 
Ihe clergy, the law and the public 
utilities, of the 32 participating, 10 are 
women, five are black and Motherwell 
was Ihe youngest to ever participate. 

The group met once a month for an 
entire day January through October. 
Each session consisted of a variely of 
speakers on different subjects such as: 
academics, economy, social services, 
arts, government, health care systems, 
finance and insurance. 

As a case study the group examined 
the school desegregation question and 
discovered at the end of the exercise 
that they had a plan for creating con- 
sensus in the community that was too 
good lo throw away.

EdUor-ln-Chief 

The faculty senate discussed Monday at their Fort Wayne senate meeting one of 
the three proposals for Ihe academic reorganization of IPFW. 

Last spring, Purdue University President Steven Beering charged the IPFW 
faculty and administration with the responsibility of reorganizing IPFW according 
to disciplines. Presently, departments are divided according to their university 
affiliation. The departments are divided into the following five academic units: 
Arts and Letters. Community Oulreach. Professional Studies (all affiliated with 
Indiana University); Engineering, Technology and Nursing and Science and 
Humanities taffiliated with Purdue University). 

The plan discussed Monday was one recommended by the faculty committee, 
The other two committees were comprised of the department chairs and the 
academic officers committee. 

The faculty's plan recommended IPFW be organized into six different schools: 
the Schoolof Arts and Sciences, the School of Business and Management Sciences, 
the School of Education, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the 
School of Fine and Performing Arts, and the School of Health Professions. 

At Monday's meeting the faculty senate attempted to discuss each school at a 
lime. Concerns were raised lhal the size of the School of Arts and Sciences was so 
big. Under (he faculty's plan.it includes 19 departments and 156 faculty, including 
Ihe Honors Program, Women's Studies, and General Studies. David Onwood, 
professor of chemistry, said Monday that if you measure the school in comparison 
to the other proposed schools in terms of the number of majors, it is about one- ha If 
as big as (he School of Business and Management Sciences. The latter would have 
about 1685 majors; Artsand Sciences would include aboutBfil. 

Michael Downs, chair ol Ihe political science department and a member of the 
Ad Hoc Committee on Academic Structure, said in reorganizing departments, the 
group had to shape and size the school in reference to the type of tasks with which 
they have to deal. "In the School ol Arts and Sciences, (the faculty) has a very 
large task to perform," Downs said. "The more hands lo perform the tasks, the 
belter." 

The senate was limited to one hour and 15 minutes Monday to discuss the whole 
plan, and did not complete their discussion, but did pass some resolutions on 
changes in the faculty recommendations. 

The Faculty approved a name change for one of the departments placed in the 
Schoolof Business and Management Sciences, Ihe department of supervision, as it 
is called now. In the unamended recommendation, the faculty changed the name to 
Personnel and Supervisory Management, to more reflect the purpose of the 
department, Monday, the faculty approved an amendment to change the name to 
Supervisory Management and Personnel. 

Changes rejected included a proposal to move economics from the School of 
(Justness and Management Sciences to the School of Arts and Sciences. George 
Bullion, director of the department of business and economics, recommended not 
moving economics to Arts and Sciences because the department is not set up so 
lhal Ihe business and economics sectors have a dual set of responsibilities. 

Another change rejected was a motion to move transitional studies from the 
School of Education to the School of Arts and Sciences. Another rejected motion 
concerning transitional studies was to have the program discarded from the 
recommendation all together. 

Bill Frederick, associate professor of mathematical sciences, said the com- 
mittee decided to include all programs in Ihe document. "We decided we would 
deal with anything that offered classes for credit on this campus," Frederick said 
Monday. That decision would include programs, such as honors program and 
transitional studies, he said. 

Thesenate meeting was recessed until Monday at noon for further discussion on 
the reorganization plan. All faculty senate meetings are held in Kettler Hall, Room 
G46. 

The final recommendation on a reorganization plan will be forwarded to 
Chancellor Thomas Wallace. Wallace said the other two recommendations are 
almost identical to the faculty's proposal. Wallace said he will then forward his 
own recommendation to Beering, as well as the other three proposals of the 
faculty, the department chairs and the academic olf icers committee. 

Beering would then have lo discuss the reorganization plan with John Ryan, 
president of Indiana University Purdue University manages the fiscal and ad- 
ministrative functions for IPFW, but still needs Ihe final approval of Indiana 
University. 

Wallace said hopefully the plan could be implemented as early as next fall. 



Changes m ade in aid application process 



B&gt; JOHN Met; At LEY 
Staff Writer 

Attempts to reduce the federal 
government's spending deficit have led 
lo some very significant changes in 
legislation governing student financial 
aid programs, According lo Richurd 
Bellows. Director of Scholarships and 
Financial Aid at IPFW, some of the 
program changes "are very good, but 
some are nol so good." 

The Higher Education Act approved 
by the federal government in 1965 and 
reviewed every five years, deals with 
Ihe manner in which all financial aid 
lor higher educalion programs will be 
awarded. Congress began its latest 
review of the act two years ago and 
approved reforms this fall. The 
reforms, effective until IB91, go into 
place for the fall 19B7 semester. 

Among Ihe positive aspects of ihe 
changes are sizable increases in the 
annual amounts awarded for the 
Guaranteed Sludenl Loan, Pell Grant. 
and National Direct Student Loan 
programs, However, olher less positive 
sides of ihe new legislation eclipse 
these aspects. 

In an added restriction. Congress has 




Richard Bellows 
Director of Scholarships 

'i"l I in. mi i.il \U\ 

attached a new time limit to a student's 
eligibility to participate in the Pell 
Grant program. Now, students will be 
limited lo participating in Ihe program 
for Ihe equivalent of five years ol full- 
time school attendance. Also, the 
Guaranteed Student Loan program 
switches from being available lo all 



applicants to a need-based award. 

According lo Bellows, one change in 
particular "will have a substantial 
impact on a large number of students at 
IPFW." This involves a redefinition of 
who can be considered an "independent 
studenl." These students considered lo 
be completely separate from their 
parents are only required to claim their 
personal financial resources when 
applying for financial aid. Deter- 
mination of need in a need-based award 
program is judged by the financial 
resources available to the individual. 
Under Ihe new law, a studenl musl be 
twenty-four years of age by Jan. 1 of the 
award year to be considered "in- 
dependent." However, students who 
are veterans of the armed forces, an 
orphan or a ward of the court, who have 
dependants other than a spouse, or who 
are married or working and not 
claimed as tax exemptions by their 
parents for the first year ol Hie award 
will be considered independent 
regardless of age. 

According to Bellows, this new law 
has the potential of taking 60 percent of 
those receiving financial aid out of 
competition (or the awards. He con- 



tinued to describe the new legislation as 
targeting federal aid to mainly "the 
neediest of the needy," those who would 
otherwise be unable to go on to seek 
higher education. 

Along with these governmental 
changes to the guidelines under which 
aid will be awarded, there have also 
been some minor changes to the ap- 
plication process. Afler Dec. 15, the 
1987-88 Indiana Student Aid Application 
and the Financial Aid Form will be 
available in the Financial Aid Office, 
located in Kettler Hall, Room 109. This 
package should be submitted after Jan. 
i, 1987, but before March 1 in order lo 
receive preferential treatment in 
processing. 

In addition lo this, an IPFW Finan- 
cial Aid Application must be filled out 
and relumed lo the Financial Aid Of- 
fice, along with the appropriate income 
Uix returns Unlike previous years past, 
every student applying for aid is 
required to submit the Financial Aid 
Form, which details the students 
available financial resources, current 
status, expenses and income in- 
formation, and information regarding 
Ihe income of the student's paren'*.

Representation missing: 
concerns being voiced 
over continued absence 



LOST: One tall, clean cut, dark haired 
male. Last seen days, even weeks ago. If 
he, by some miracle, is spotted on 
campus, he will answer to: Mr. 
President, Joe, or Mr. Motherwell. If 
seen please contact the IPFW Student's 
Government office immediately. 

The advertisement could also read: 

HELP WANTED: Student Body 
President. Responsibilities varied. Will 
be required to spend some time working 
with and for students of IPFW. Seat has 
been vacant for some lime. Help needed 
immediately. 

Sad but true. Help is needed in the 
Student's Government office as soon as 
possible. Students have been 
complaining the presidents office is 
always found empty. Senators are 
complaining of being overworked, 
carrying the responsibilities of others on 
their shoulders. The question arises ... 
Mr. President, where have you been? 

A few months ago promises were 
made that an "open door" 
administration would exist in the 
Student Government's office if the team 
headed by Motherwell were elected 



Unfortunately, the opposite is true. 
What, in actuality, exists is a "closed 
door" administration. 

Closed and locked ... no one in the 
president's office to see you... at least 
during the daytime when most students 
are on campus. 

To make matters worse, the position of 
Student Body President is an hourly paid 
position, Motherwell is compensated for 
work supposedly done weekly. If that 
is the case, Purdue University should be 
pleased with Motherwell. 

Look at all the money he is saving 
them by not working much. But, is this 
really the ease? 

Students are becoming vocal 
concerning the need for an active, 
aggressive president. There is an entire 
semester ahead filled with meetings and 
activities centered around student life. 
Representation is needed there and 
elsewhere. 

There is more than one student on this 
campus qualified to fill the shoes of 
student body president. Maybe it's time 
someone does just that. 



For your enjoyment... 
some Christmas cheer 



'Twas the nighl belore Christmas al 1 U 
Purdue, 

No students were studying ■ 1ml that': 
nothing new. 

Finals are over, vacation is near, it's now 
time 

lo party and raise lots of cheer. 

The campus was empty, the building all 
bleak, 

the sludents were partying, they've been 
drunk all week 

The profs were all resting at home in their 
beds, 

thinking and planning the semester ahead. 

When inside of Walb, there was such a 
noise, 

that everyone thought it was those darn Sig 
Ep boys 

Away lo the building the cops they ran, 
but all they found was a well dressed man. 

The smile on the face of the man did tell. 



it was Chancellor Wallace singing "Noel." 

"Good wishes to students and faculty alike, 
Merry Christmas to all and to all a good 
night."

Registration process needs reworking to succeed 



By JUDY RAMSEY 

Staff Writer 

Registration lime is here 

again. Thursday, Dec -1 

marked the end of early 

registration, 

Commentary 

1 decided lo take ad- 
vantage of the opportunity to 
register early. 1 would like to 
comment on one aspect of 
the regis t ration procedure 
which I feel warrants 
correction by the ad- 
ministration from the 
university. 

The registration process 
on a whole operates 
smoothly There was one 
particular area, however, 



*hich I &lt; 
unchanged. 

During registration, 
students are lined up oulside 
admissions in Ketller Hall 
wailing for their turn to gel 
inside. Here extending down 
the length of two halls are 
sludents waiting lo drop-add, 
students who were unable lo 
register at their specified 
time and waiting to do so 
with (he others and sludents 
wailing in line for a certain 
time. 

The next problem begins 
al the doorway. Here total 
confusion reigns. 

The administration has 
two people sitting al a desk 
just inside, Their job is to 
check the student's 
registration cards over and 



validate the card if 
everything is in proper or- 

I think the university could 
alleviate this situation by 
designating an individual to 
work with admissions. This 
individual would instruct the 
sludents through the ad- 
mission process in an or- 
derly fashion by having 
those students who are ready 
lor admittance according to 
the timetable, drop-add, or 
those registering from a 
different day stand on one 
side of the hall while having 
all others stand on the op- 
posite side. 

At the present lime, 1 think 
the students have been at- 
tempting lo do this for 



themselves, unfortunately, 
Iheir efforts have no! been 
loo successful. Some of the 
reasons, 1 feel, which are 
causing this have resulted 
from those sludents who are 
cutting in front of the line 
because they are a drop-add 
or because they had been 
scheduled on one of the 
preceding days. These 
students are by-passing this 
mass confusion by going 
ahead of everyone else; yet, 
their actions are restricting 
the movement of the line. 

Then there are those 
sludents who refuse lo leave 
their place in line. I can 
appreciate their position. 
Since the wait can last longer 
than fifteen mmules, they 



can proceed right into ad- 
missions upon Iheir arrival 
al the door withoul having 
held anybody up from having 



I think this problem of 
admissions lias been ignored 
long enough It's time for the 
administration to evaluate 
the situation and implement 
some type of action to 
alleviate it This could gel 
progressively worse if the 
number of students enrolling 
at IPFW increases. It is 
obvious some form of 
leadership is needed here, 
and I think it is the 
responsibility of Ihe 
university lo see that it is 
provided. 



—Letters to the Editor- 




Welcome lo 
Wally World 

To the Editor: 

So this is Wally World!! 

It began as a fictional 
amusement park in 
"National Lampoon's: 
Vacation." Then came the 
actual California 
amusement park. Can there 
be any doubl that the sub- 
sequent appoint of IPFW's 
:hancellor, Thomas 
Wallace, was mere coin- 
cidence? Wally World, in- 
deed. 

(Shall we lake a ride?) 

Professor Katherine 
Kulick has taught french al 
IPFW since 1984 and is 
currently completing her 
dissertation It has come lo 
our attention, however, that 
Professor Kulick will nol be 
reappointed after the 1986-87 
academic year because she 
does not now hold her doc- 
torate. 

(Hop on.) 

When originally hired, 
Professor Kulick had a 
verbal agreement with Ihe 



Dean of Arts and Leliers and 
the head of the Modern 
Foreign Language depart- 
ment (o the effect that she 
would have until the end of 
the 1986-H7 academic year to 
complete her dissertation. 
Professor Kulick has proven 
herself effective in the 
classroom and has worked 
unselfishly for the university 
outside of the classroom. She 
is young, intelligent, vibrant, 
and able Lo relate to her. 
students in a manner from 
which more professors could 
profit. She is well-liked and 
respected by her peers. She 
is supported by the depart- 
ment chair as well as the 
dean of the school of Arts and 
Letters. Her ability is cer- 
tainly recognized by most. 

(Hang on, now.) 

And yet. Chancellor 
Wallace has elected not to 
reappoint her He apparently 
claims that Professor Kulick 
should have completed her 
dissertation in Oclober, 
nearly a full year ahead of 
the time agreed upon when 
she was initially hired. 

(Curves ahead.) 



Presumably. Chancellor 
Wallace intends to upgrade 
the faculty by discarding 
ihose who cannot im- 
mediately meet his stan- 
dards. A commendable aim, 
but one which, if pursued 
with an inflexible attitude, 
can produce a grealer harm 
to the university. IPFW must 
now find an instructor for 
next -year with the same 
qualifications that Professor 
Kulick will have by next 
year. 

II cannot be denied that 
Chancellor Wallace has the 
right to take such action. 
Perhaps he even enjoys It. 
Consider where we are, after 
all. 

(Steep descentll 

But by holding to Ibis in- 
flexible position he is 
reneging on the original 
agreement with Professor 
Kulick 

i Does this ride ever end? ) 

This is the type of conduct 
and policy from a man whom 
The Communicator would 
like us to support. Professor 
Kulick can go on to be a 
significant instructor at 



another university But what 
of the loss in quality to IPFW 
and its future french 
students? 

Sound like Wally World?

Better safe 

than sorry 

To the Editor, 

What will it take for the 
university administration 
and physical plant to lake 
repeated requests seriously? 

During the winter months, 
for the past several years, 
repealed appeals have been 
made to the university lo 
install a safety rail on the 
inclined walkway between 
the athletic building and 



Walbs loading dock 
driveway The slightest bit 
of ice or snow makes this 
incline treacherous More 
than once, people have been 
witnessed slipping, sliding 
and falling while attempting 
lo ascend -descend the walk- 
way. 

What is it going to take ... a 
serious injury? ... a lawsuit 
against the university? 
Granted, physical plant 
til tempts lo keep it clean 
most of the lime, but often 
when shoveled, the layer of 
ice remaining becomes even 
more of a danger 

Please do something to 
help students, faculty, staff 
and visitors who must utilize 
Walb Union during winter 
months. As the old saying 
goes ... "Better safe than

"Hispannlad Fori Wayne," a 
show presented in Spanish 
and focusing on the Spanish 
community in Fort Wayne. 
St. Francis College is 
working in conjunction with 
IPFW to produce a 
politically-oriented show to 
discuss different aspects of 
world politics. 

"I am encouraging 
students to come and 
produce a half-hour journal- 
type magazine show that wilt 
utilize the talents of a 
number of students who are 
in the communication area," 
Nikpour said. This project 
will be assisted by three or 
four practicum students. He 
hopes this project will "open 
up a lot of different avenues 
for other students." 

Nikpour hopes to hold 
workshops in video 



communications majors, 
starting in late January or 
early February. 

A native of Iran, Nikpour 
was graduated in August, 
1936. from Iowa State 
University, with a master's 
degree in community and 
regional planning. His minor 
was lelecommunicative arts. 
He also holds a bachelor's 
degree in architecture from 
Iowa State. 

Nikpour's experience 
includes working as public 
relations liaison for the Iowa 
State dean of students, in 
addition to leaching, 
photography, preparation of 
audio-visual materials, and 
drafting. He also worked 
with the Iowa State 
lelecommunicative arts 
department and their 
student channel, besides 
producing documentaries 
and talk shows.' 

He is a member of both 
Tau Sigma Delta, an honor 
society for architectural and 



allied arts, and of Alpha 
Epsilon lino-National 
Broadcasting Society. 

Major programming for 
Channel 23 currently in- 
cludes the Spanish In- 
ternational Network, on 
from S p.m. nightly to noon 
the next day, Monday 
through Friday, and all day 
Saturday and Sunday, From

ming includes Silent Net- 
work (for the hearing im- 
paired), NASA programs, 
variety and serial 
programming, and satellite 
programming. 

Nikpour's primary object 
is "to produce locally- 
generated programming by 
students or faculty or co- 
produce programs with 
other universities. 

"I encourage all students 
with interests in television 
production and ideas to come 
and talk with me," he 
comments. "Not knowing 
anything about television 
should not be a deterrent."

There is a group of IPFW

rather, bowling, to help a

cochlear implant for the 10- 
year-old boy. whose name 
she did not want to disclose. 

Kachuk said the cochlear 
implant will help improve 
the hearing of the boy, whose 
deafness was caused from a 
bout of meningitis. A 
cochlear implant is a 
surgical process where an 
artificial device is placed in 
the cochlear area of the ear 
and allows sound to be

Famous poem 
has survived 
for 163 years 



It started out as a simple 
poem for his children. Yet 
Clement Moore's "The Night 



efore 



Chr: 



published in 1B23, turned out 
lo be one of the most suc- 
cessful and beloved poems in 
history. Why? 

The answer is simplicity 
itself, says a Purdue 
University English professor 
and poet, Felix Slefaiiile 
"ll's simply a good story. II 
has the common touch. And 
whatever people say, its 
withstood the test of time," 
Slefanile notes. "And that," 
he adds, "constitutes the 
definition of a classic." 

He says the poem appeals 
to high brows, low brows and 
middle brows. "Moore used 
good, plain English, which 
people like " The language 
might even be considered "a 
bit elegant" today, the 
professor notes, but il still 



works. 

When he says it's a good 
story, Stefanile means the 
poem has all the elements of 
good fiction — action, 
suspense, humor and a good 
ending. 

"It's unabashedly sen- 
timental, and people like 
that." 

The poem'sspecial appeal, 
of course, is for children, 
who associate it with the 
excitement and mystique of 
Santa Claus. "II delivers 
beautifully orally, and 
children can either listen to 
it or recite it themselves and 
really enjoy its sound," says 
Slefanile. 

And, because the poem 
symbolizes a tradition that's 
celebrated each year, it's 
bound Lo be around for a long 
time to come.

Gift certificates: Great gift idea 



By MARY POPOVICH 
Slaft Writer 

Stymied by what lo buy your loved ones for Christmas? 

Then consider giving a gift certificate, which is both 
practical and popular. There's a perfect one available for 
nearly every person on your shopping list. 

Most people associate gift certificates with large depart- 
ment stores Bui there are also certificates available for 
many other places and services. 

For example, gift certificates can be purchased right here 
at IPFW. Folletfs Uruversity Bookstore offers certificates 
for $5 and up thai can be applied toward the purchase of any 
merchandise. This includes collegiate sportswear, school 
supplies and books. 

Many of Fort Wayne's fine restaurants also offer gift 
certificates. These are available for the Wharf, Moonraker, 
and Don Hall's restaurants, to name a few. In addition, most 
fast food chains offer booklets of gift certificates for around 
SS. 

For people who don't like to eat out but still like to eat, gift 
certificates are available at most grocery stores in the area. 
This would be nice to give to persons on a fixed income. 

Physical fitness is growing in popularity, and there are 
also gift certificates available in this area. At the YWCA, 2000 
Wells Street, a one-year gift membership is S17.S0. The 
YMCA offers $10 gifl certificates which can be applied to 
class fees or court time at any of its three locations. A one- 
year adult membership is $216. 

Recreation is another area for which gift certificates are 
available. These may be purchased in any dollar amount for 



skaiingaltbeIceRinkontheTerrace,tilenbrook,andforthe 
Roller Dome's north and south locations. 

Gift certificates for bowling alleys are another possibility. 
For example, at Pro Bowl Wesl, 1455 Goshen Avenue, they 
can be purchased for $5 and $10 amounts. 

Most video stores offer gift certificates. At Leisuretlme 
Video. 9173 Lima Road, they can be purchased for any dollar 
amount and applied toward ihe rental or purchase of 
anything in ihe store. Oelmar Rental, 5311 Merchandise 
Drive, offers $5.55 gift certificates good for 3-day checkout of 
any tape. 

The gift of travel could be an exciting possibility Many 
local travel agencies offer gift certificates toward air 
transportation or travel packages. 

In addition, some commercial airlines offer travel cer- 
tificates. At Delta Airlines, for example, a minimal $350 
certificate is available and may be used up to one year from 
dale of purchase. 

But for persons who would like to "get away" for awhile 
without leaving Fori Wayne, there are other options. Some 
local hotels and motels offer weekend packages for gift 

Entertainment is but another means of "getting away." At 
the Embassy Theatre, gift certificates are available in any 
dollar amount. The Civic Theatre offers $8 gift certificates 
for two seats to any of its productions. 

These are but a (ew of the possibilities for unusual gifl 
giving Tor Christmas. Just "let your mind do the thinking and 
your fingers do the walking," and chances are that you'll 
come up with a gift certificate that's perfect for your "hard 
lo buy for" person.

seem to lead to stress. Then, 
lake the initiative — in a 
gentle way — to change the 
pattern. 



i told i 



that 



I whenherparenlscomeover, 
problems seem lo develop 
invariably in the kitchen," 



Denlon says. "The mother 
wanted to take over and that 
was a regular stress point. 
■'So, the woman wrote her 
mother before the holiday 
and said; 'I want you to be a 
guest in my house. I'll do the 
cooking.' 

"It worked marvelously. I 
wonder if the mother also 
wasn't jusl a bit relieved 
because she no longer felt 
responsible for how the 
meals turned out." 

Another way to avoid 
stress is to slay in a hotel 
when visiting, if you can 
afford it, he says. 

"Having too many people 
in one house, in one kitchen, 
for loo long can be a severe 
source of stress, even when 
everyone likes each other,"

Denton says. "Also, retur- 
ning to the hotel is helpful as 
an emolional relief from 
each other." 

Many of his clients 
respond, though, that they 
would be afraid of insulting 
their hosts. 

•I think that's not as valid 
as we might think," he says. 
"I've never run across 
anyone who was insulted 
because someone stayed in a 
hotel or helped with the food 
bill." 

"As for the people in the 
family with the I'll-pick-up- 
ihe-check syndrome," he 
says, "we just insist on 
separate checks." 

Another way to cut stress 
is to cut the length of the 
visit, he says. 

"Slaying two days, if it's a 



good experience, is better 
than four days of bad ex- 
perience," he says. 
"Relatives have their own 
lives lo live and your visit 
upsets their schedule and 
clutters their day. So staying 
fewer days can lower stress, 
enhance satisfaction and 
also reduce the cost." 

Denlon also urges people 
to take the initiative to 
change outdated family 
traditions. 

"In some families, you 
give presents as high as the 
third cousin," he says. "Not 
only is that expensive, but 
it's a burden All that 
shopping. 1 took the initiative 
in my family 1 suggested 
giving one gift per family. 
Simple is besl: a magazine 
subscription, a box of jellies. 



cheese. 

Another rule of thumb, he 
says, is avoid burning up too 
much energy trying to 
change relatives' habits or 
personalities. 

"Practically nobody likes 
to be changed," he says 
"It's usually taken as a 
criticism." 

Denlon also recommends 
planning activities for the 
family gatherings. 

"Don't sit around staring 
at eachotherandsay; 'What 
do you want to do?' 'I don't 
know. What do you want to 
do?' Plan at least one thing 
lo do every day to add some 
structure. 

■'ih'oQr family, we get 
together and make music. 
Everyone brings an in- 
strument. In others, they 



might build : 

sledding, visit other family 

members, play games. 

Las! but far from least, he 
says, instead of going to your 
relatives' house on Christ- 
mas Day, go after Christ- 
mas. 

"We have a delayed 
Christmas very often," he 
says. "Dec. 29 was gift- 
opening day at our house last 
year. Our children spent 
Christmas Day with their in- 

"Then when our turn 
came, everyone was more at 
ease. And I had a sense that 
we had Ihe Iwo Christmases: 
one on the 25lh wilh friends

family."

Kids do not always get a second chance 



ByJUDY RAMSEY 
Stall Writer 
Toys are part of a child's 
world of play. Toys keep a 
child entertained and oc- 
cupied. They arc also im- 
portant in the physical, 
menial, social, and 
emotional development of a 
child. 

Toys have been around for 
a long lime. Many dolls and 
toy animals have been found 
in thepyramids of Egypt and 
the burial mounds of ancient 
Persia. Delicate dolls 
dressed in embroidered 
gowns decorated with 
precious stones have been 
discovered by an- 

thropologists among the 
ruins of ancient Crete. The 
construction of Ihe first doll 
house has been attributed to 
the Dutch. 

Teaching religion to a 
child was done through toys 
Ai one point in lime, children 
from ancient societies were 
given toys to safeguard 
against poor health, to ward 
off evil spirits, and to insure 
a long lire. People unable to 
read saw the Bible stories re- 
enacted before them through 
puppets and marionettes. 
This method was used by Ihe 
priests from the early 
Christian church. 

Playing is work to a child, 
and toys are the tools he uses 
in growing up. Children who 
play with toys often become 
more imaginative and 
creative than children whose 



playtime and toys are 
limited. Toys enable a child 
to familiarize himself with 
his environment. He gains a 
sense of values, learns how 
to interact with others while 
becoming more responsive 
to people's needs. More 
importantly, he learns how 
to love. 

Each year, around f250 is 
spent on toys Tor one 
American child. Most toys 
are purchased at Christmas 
lime; unfortunately, some 
toys do not provide the 
pleasure intended for the 
recipient 

A publication dated Nov. 
26, 1986, issued by the In- 
diana State Board of Health, 
said 123,000 injuries 
occurred that were toy- 
related. Of this figure, 
103,000 were children under 
theage of IS. This report also 
related injuries attributed to 
bicycles, roller skates, sleds, 
skate boards, riding toys, 
tricycles, balls, marbles, 
balloons, kites, crib toys and 
even toy chests. 

Shirley Thompson, fifth 
coordinator of the 
Emergency Care Center at 
Parkview Memorial 
Hospital, cited swallowing as 
Ihe worst hazard for 
children Since Ihe federal 
laws regulating the 
manufacturing of toys have 
become so effective, most of 
the accidents treated at the 
hospital resulted from a 
child ingesting part of a toy 



A child can become 
asphyxiated from the small 
chips used in tiddlywinks, 
marbles, and Ihe little 
houses found in a monopoly 
game. Thompson further 
staled that a toy may be 
suitable for one age group 
yet very dangerous to a 
younger sibling. 

Mike Walker, poison in- 
formation specialist from 
Ihe Indiana Poison Control 
Center in Indianapolis, said 
that high levels of lead in 
paint and the swallowing of 
objects causing internal 
injuries, lacerations, 
choking or suffocation 
reflect some of the major 
problems associated with 
children playing with toys. 

It is important to take the 
time and care in choosing a 
child's toy. Wooden fire 
trucks from Marlon 
Creations, Long Island City, 
New York, and the Voltron 
Lion robot toys made by 
Matchbox Toys, Ltd. of 
Moonachie. New Jersey, 
have been recalled by the 
Consumer Safety Product 
Commission. The fire truck 
poses a choking hazard, and 
the Voltorn toy has illegal 
amounts of lead in the toy's 
paint 

The Toy Manufacturers of 
America recommended the 
following guidelines in an 
article written by Alison 
Bethel Tor the News-Sentinel 
dated Nov 27, 1986: 



1. Toys should suit the 
child's age, skills, abilities 
and interests. 

2. They should be of sturdy 
construction. 

3. Children younger than 
three should not be given 
toys with small parts that 
children may put into their 
mouths or long strings or 
cords that may cause 
strangulation. 

4. Arrows or darllike toys 
should have soft cork tips, 
rubber suction cups or other 
pro tec live strips securely 
attached to their shafts. 

5. Electric toys with 
healing elements are 
recommended only for 
children older than eight and 
only as long as there is adult 
supervision. 

6. Toys should be avoided 
that shoot or propel objects 
that may injure eyes or lodge 
in throats. 

7. Toy instructions should 
be clear to adults and child, 
and adults should supervise 
play if necessary 

8. Older children should 
keep possibly hazardous toys 
away from younger children. 

9. Children playing with 
riding toys should be kept 
away from stairs, traffic, or 
pools 

10. Toys should be 
examined regularly for 
jagged or sharp edges, or 
missing pieces that might be 
swallowed, and they should 
be repaired immediately or 
discarded. 



The U.S. Consumer 
Product Safety Commission 
has set safety regulations 
under the Federal Hazar- 
dous Substances Acl and the 
Consumer Product Safely 
Act for children's articles 
and certain toys. These 
regulations set guidelines 
which manufacturers must 
follow in the designing of and 
Ihe manufacturing of their 
products so that hazardous 
products are not produced or 
sold. 

The responsibility for a 
child's safety is the concern 
of everybody. Read labels 
carefully. Once a toy has 
been opened, discard the 
plastic wrapping at once! To 
avoid trips and falls, instruct 
a child to put their 
playthings where they 
belong after they're done 
playing with them. 

Loud noises may impair a 
child's hearing. The law 
requires warning labels on 
the boxes of toy caps 
producing noise above a 
certain level. Look for this 
warning label. Some toys are 
made for older children; 
follow the age recom- 
mendations. 

Toy-related injuries can be 
diminished through careful 
toy selection and proper 
adult supervision. Children 
are not invincible. They need 
lime lo grow up. Sometimes, 
children don't get a second

Feature Editor 

Clint Eastwood stars in 
■■Heartbreak Ridge," the 
story of a soldier without a 
war. 

Gunnery Sergeant Tom 
Highway (Eastwood) is a 
man who has served in the 
Korean war and in the 
Vietnam war. Now he has 
returned to train fighting 
Marines The highlight of the 
movie is when Highway and 
his platoon are sent to 
Grenada, 



Eastwood has played the 
tough guy many limes in the 
past. Some of these hard 
type movies are "The En- 
forcer." 'The Gauntlet. ■' 
"Escape from Alcatraz," 
"Firefox," and "Sudden 
Impact ." 

Complimenting East- 

wood's performance is 
Marsha Mason, who had 
three Academy Award 
nominations including one 
for her role in "The Good- 
Bye Girl." Mason plays 



Friends of Library 
campaign for cash 



Highway's ex-wife, Aggie. 
Although she could not live 
with him in the past Aggie 
feels he, may be changing. 

Other characters in 
"Heartbreak Ridge" include 
Highway's goof-off platoon. 

Platoon members include 
Stitch Jones (Mario van 
Peebles). Stitch would much 
rather be a rock star than in 
the Marines and this 
naturally causes friction 
with Highway who has been 
a Marine most of his adult 
life. Peebles has had roles in 
"L.A. Law," Francis Cop- 
pola's "Cotton Club," and 
"The Last Resort." 



Lieutenant Ring (Boyd 
Gaines) is a serious soldier 
just out of Officer Candidate 
School Although he is High- 
way's direct superior High- 
way ends up teaching him 
about Marine fighting. 

Gaines is a Julliard 
Theatre Center graduate 
with a great deal of theatre 
experience including "Our 
Town," "The Tempest," and 
the musical "She Loves 
Me." 

"Heartbreak Ridge" is a 
Malpaso production, a 
company that is owned by 
Clint Eastwood.

Alter picking up a 64-56 
win over Huntington, 
Saturday, the IPFW 
women's basketball learn 
will try to improve on their 2- 
S record with o couple of 
road contests this week

hit 13 of 16 free tosses in the 
final three minutes to lake 
the eight-point win. IPFW hit 
24 of 31 tosses during the 
course of the game to snap a 
three-game losing skid. 




In the Huntington game 
the team was nearly back at 
full strength after suiting up 
just seven players for a 
game earlier in the week. 

I. 'in Miller tflnger), Becky 
Malanic (knee) and Michelle 
Crist (ankle) all missed the 
Wayne State game due to 
injuries but Matanic and

has been on the sidelines 
since the season opener and 
won't be able to play at least 
until the December 20 game 
against Saginaw Valley. 



Senior Bev Miller has 
become more of an offensive 
force over the past three

College basketball: A look from the inside 



Okay. gang, it's time to 
take a quickie look al the 
upcoming college basketball 

kaleidoscopic recap in a 
nutshell of what to look tor 
this year. 

First off, what everyone 
wants to know about are the 
teams. Because of 
Proposition 48, picking the 
Top 20 is more difficult this 
year than ever before, 
because nobody can be sure 
how the loss of certain fresh- 
men will affect the blend of 
the learns Ihey would have 
played for. 

Thai mokes this, without a 
doubt, the year of the 
sleepers. There is no odds-on 
favorite, with maybe the 
exception ol Dean Smith's 
Tar Heels of North Carolina, 
bui even then they'd have to 
be injury-free in the back- 
court, and the Baby Twin 
Towers of freshmen J.R. 
Reid and Scott Williams 
would have to mature 
rapidly. 

In this year of the sleeper, 
my sleeper for the entire 
country is the Hawkeyes of 
Iowa from the Big Ten. It 
seems to me that the right 
ingredienls are Dr. Tom 
Davis' material, and the fear 
that he miglil have to return 
to Stanford for the rest of his 
life. 

In between are some 30 
clubs that can do it all, 
especially if you play Giddy- 
Uprondball with the talen- 
ted, playground-oriented 
teams that can beat you. 

Another tiling to look for 
this season is the three-point 
chip shot from 19 feet, 9 
inches oul — something that 
the aware coaches will find 
should slow the game down. 
At the end of the game, you'll 
find teams that foul in- 
lentionally if they're behind, 
lo exchange the potential of 
two foul shots for the 
possible three-point chippie. 
What that will eventually 
lead to, I think, is a rule 
allowing the team the option 
to take the two shots or take 
the ball out of bounds, ala 
international rules. 

Also, I think you'll see 
clubs this year take the 
initial possession each time 




mio 



per in 



shot 



because the percentages 
favor them so much 
mathematically. And, you'll 
also see some clubs pull up 
on a fast break and let it fly 
from the top of the key, and 
let the wingmen go on in for 
position to board. 



There are a few things of 
which you can be sure. The 
three-point chippie will slop 
Ihe postage-stamp zones 
around the 7-foot post- 
master, because the 19-9 
distance is so close that 
anyone who's ever picked up 
a basketball can hit a 
respectable percentage. 
Remember, you only have to 
hit two of six shots .(33 
percent) from three-point 
range for six points, but 
must make three of six (SO 
percent) from inside for the 
same six. 

What does that mean? 
Thai, sure as death and 
taxes, the three-point play 
will be moved closer to the 
NBA distance of 23'S" next 
season. 

Something else that should 
be pointed out is that for the 
third year in a row we have a 
different conference that's 
on their after-burner. This 
time around, I feel, the Big 
Ten from top to bottom 
would blow away the rest of 
the country. There are four 
potential top teams in the 
Hawkeyes, the Hoosiers, the 
Boilermakers and the Illini 
— wilhOhio State, Michigan, 
and Michigan State all being 
tough at home, and the last 
three teams (Wisconsin, 
Minnesota and North- 
western) being more 
representative than any of 
the last three teams in any 
other conference. 

So where does the power 
lie? Well, I go to the 
Southeastern Conference No. 
2, the Atlantic Coast Con- 
ference No. 3, then the Big 
East, Big Eight and PAC-10. 
And remember I said this:

From Ihose six conferences 
(don't forget the Big Ten) 
will come almost half Ihe 
teams in Ihe NCAA tour- 
Let's shake the glass again 
and touch on my All- 
American team, the five 
bluechip thoroughbreds of 
the 1986-87 season. 

My All-American club's 
Utsi.ii ne is solid, with Pervis 
Ellison and the Cardinals of 
Louisville being late 
bloomers; center David 
Robinson, whether he's 
eligible or not, being a first- 
round pick in the NBA, and 
the Midshipmen of Navy 
winning 20 games and going 
lo Ihe NCAA, but no Bourbon 
Street in March; and Kan- 
sas* Danny Manning, may be 
one of the greatest potential 
juniors to come down the 
pipe, learning to become 
more selfish. 



Take note: If this baseline 
wants to wear red, white and 
blue in 1988, Korea could be 
no contest. And also, that the 
one ballplayer that could 
compliment this awesome 
threesome would be Charles 
Smith from Pittsburgh. 

In my All-American back- 
court, I have to leave out the 
southern voting block of 
Kenny Smith of North 
Carolina and Tommy 
Amaker of Duke and go with 
Ihe best shot in baskethall — 
and don't let me hear from 
you Reggie Miller fans al 
UCLA even though he will 
probably lead the country in 
scoring this season — Steve 
Alford of Indiana. 

My last kid is con- 
troversial, but I also think he 
brings more to his team than 
Ihe other four — and that's 
David Rivers, who runs the 
show and has changed the 



style of ball at Notre Dame, 
a player who has all (he 
qualities of leadership any 
Scoutmaster — or NBA team 
- could ask. 

Now, lo wrap this up, 1 
want lo talk just a minute 
about Proposition 48. winch 
has embarrassed more than 
too college athletes, bill 
which I feel is good down the 
line, even though it's been a 
crucifix on their lives. A lol 
of people may think they're 
dum-dums, bul how can any 
person gel out of any high 
school in this country and U 
a dumdum? 

The problem here is thai 
there are a large number ol 
players involved from city 
schools and from homi'i thai 
can't afford lo pay a couple 
hundred dollars to hire 
tutors lo help prep them lor 
their SAT and ACTs 

The point is, the fault is 
with the high school, not the 
athlete involved. If he gels a 
high school degree, he should 
be able to play college bait. 
The people who put this in 
are saying thai the inner 
city schools aren'l qualified, 
but (he truth of the matter is 
that the ACTs and SAT are 
culturally and regionally 
unfair. 

What ,11131 means if that 
we'll probably blow a! least 
two more years of out- 
standing freshmen classes, 
but I guess the end justifies

Mastodons slowed by ranked teams 




It's been nearly three 
weeks since Ihe IPFW men's 
baskethall team has played 
on their home hardwoods 
but. following a contest at 
IUPUI. Thursday, the 'Dons 
will get to play in front of 
their home fans this 
weekend. Grand Valley State 
will provide the competition 
Saturday at 8 p.m. 

The 'Dons have ex- 
perienced rough times their 
last two outings, dropping 
games to nationally ranked 
Ferris State and Wright 
Stale. They'll carry a 3-2 
mark to Indianapolis 
Thursday for the 7:30 p.m. 
contest at IUPUI. 

The Metros return all- 
region guard Aid ray Gibson 
and are 4-3 in the early going 
this season. IPFW won a low- 
ing 54-47 affair last 
hen the Iwo teams 
hooked up in Fort Wayne. 

Grand Valley is 3-2 on the 



year with a home game 
Wednesday against Hope 
before the contest with 
IPFW Saturday. The Lakers 
feature a balanced offensive 
attack with guard Mike 
Davis and center Kevin 
Dungey both averaging 
about IS points per game. 
The last time the teams 
played, in 1984-85, IPFW 
came away with an 83-75 



Senior Bruce Erwin 
finished the 1985-86 season 
with several strong games 
and that play has carried 
over to the first five games 
Ihis season. The 6-7 center- 
forward tops IPFW with a 
17.4 points per game average 
and he's also pulling in 7 
rebounds per contest. His 61 
percent field goal shooting 
tops the squad's regular 
players and he's already 
blocked 15 shots. Erwin has 
also been perfect on nine 



attempts from the free throw 
line. 

The front line was banged 
uplast week ami il sh"v.' I 
Ferris State as the Bulldogs 

pulled down 111 

rebounds than IPFW Six- 
foot-six senior Jim Mori an 
missed ihe game with a 
sprained ankle and 6-5 junior 
Dennis Williams played bul 
lias been slowed all season 
by ankle problems Wii.lt a 
week off since their last 
game action, both players 
should be at full strength for 
the IUPUI contest. 

IPFW made its most ex- 
tensive use of the three point 
shot in the recent loss lo 
Ferris Stale. Sophomore 
guard Eric Wilson tossed in 
five of nine three pointers 
and freshman Jim Rayl hit 
Iwo of four from Ihe I9'9 
stripe. On Ihe season the 

'Dons are 14 of 34 lr he
