The Executive Director of 
the Fore Wayne Fine Arts 
Foundation, Dr. Ralph Koh- 
Ihoff, has appointed Mr. 
Charles A. I^uer Jr., as 
playwright committee cha- 
irman for the May 25-28, 
1973, Fine Arts Festival. 
This is a newprogramfor 
the festival, designed to en- 
rich and widen the scope 
of planned activities. Se- 
lection of the playwright 
committee is now in pro- 
gress with forth coming 
member selections to be 
announced. Composition of 
the committee body is aim- 
ed at a varied background 
of interests in the drama- 
tic arts and theater. The 
intended panel members 
having knowledge in direct- 
ing, writi ng, educational 
drama teaching, and inclu- 
ding theater patrons, will 
be the objective. 

Since the playwright com- 
petition is new for the 1973 
Festival this year, a new 
experimental system label- 
ed: "The Overlapping 
Technique," will De em- 
ployed. It consists of a

choose the 16 men who have 
speaking parts in the film. 

Although military person- 
nel have frequently been 
used as background extras 
in Hollywood films, this Is 
the first time that members 
of any branch of the armed 
forces have been employed 
for feature roles. 

"the D.I." tells the story 
of a hard-boiled drill in- 
structor who Is faced with 
a problem platoon and an 
emotionally disturbed trai- 
nee. The film accurately 
depicts never-before- 
filmed scenes of Marine 
training at Parrls Island. 

Monica Lewis and Jackie 



Loughery star In the film 
with Don Dubbins, Lin Mc- 
Carthy and Virginia Gregg. 
Jack Webb produced and di- 
rected from a screenplay 
by James Lee Barrett. 

Showings will be at 3:30 
p.m. in Room 146, Educa- 
tion Building, and at 5:30,

ed by the film series are.

ed, on February 9th, and

Job Outlook Brightens 



The job market for college 
graduates, which took a 
slight turn for the better 
In 1972, gives signs of 

further improvement this 
year. 

The optimism is reflected 
In the resultsof two nation- 

APO'73 
Reports 

The Alpha Phi Omega 
Fraternity handled a total 
of 1,513 volumes during its 
recent Book Exchange on 
Campus. Sponsored this 
year from January 10-23, 
during and after spring 
registration, the exchange 
is a semi-annual project of 
the service organization. 

Of the 1,513 total, 950 
books were sold, making a 
64% success. Booksre- 
turned to their owners 
numbered 493, and 70 vol- 
umes went unclaimed. 

A 10 cent service fee was 
charged by the fraternity 
for each book handled, re- 
sulting in earnings of$159. 
30. The sum of$145.10was 
unclaimed. 

After deducting expenses, 
APO made a net profit of 
$209.85 from the book ex- 
change. 



al surveys of employers' 
1973 hiring plans, one 
conducted by the College 
Placement Council and the 
other by Frank S. Endicott, 
placement director 
emeritus at Northwestern 
University. 

The council's survey, 
which covered 672 em- 
ployers. Indicates a 15- 
per-cent increase over last 
year in Jhe demand for j 
bachelor's degree-hold- 
ers, a 22 - per- cent 
Increase for those with 
master's degrees, and a 
20-per-cent increase for 
Ph.D's. 

Mr. Endicott, who survey- 
ed some 186 employers, 
predicts a 19-per-cent in- 
crease at the bachelor's 
level and a 20-per-cent in- 
crease at the master's 
level. 

Both surveys found that 
the biggest Improvement 
will be for engineering 
graduates. Mr. Endicott 
expects a 42-per-cent in- 
crease in the demand for 
engineers with bachelor's 
degrees and a 27-per-cent 
increase at the master's 
level, while the council 
anticipates a 26-per-cent 
increase overall. 



Apparently one of the rea- 
sons behind the expanded 
hiring plans is optimism 
that the nation's economy 
will Improve in 19 7 3. 
Seventy-five per-cent of 
the respondents told Mr. 
Endicott they expected 

economic conditions to be 
better than in 1972. 

Among other highlights of 
the two studies: 

Some 73 per cent of the 
companies surveyed op- 
pose the adoption of the 
three-year bachelor's de- 
gree, largely because they 
think It would produce 
graduates who are less 
mature. (Endicott). 

Four-fifths of the com- 
panies frown on the trend 
toward pass-fail, credit- 
no-credit, and other vari- 
ations of the letter-grading 
system. (Endicott). 

Nearly oO per cent of the 
companies say it doesn't 
necessarily pay a person 
who hopes to reach a high- 
level management position 
to get a master's degree 
in business administration 
(Endicott). 

Liberal arts graduates 
are still the least at- 



tractive to employers, al- 
though even for them the 
demand in 1973 will be 
up about 4 per cent (Coun- 
cil). 

The demand for woman 
graduates will increase 
sharply this year, and the 
demand for black gradu- 
ates will still outstrip the 
supply. In hiring both 
women and blacks,, com- 
panies often cite as major 
problems the lack of peo- 
ple qualified in the fields 
where there are jobs, part- 
icularly in engineering, 
business administration, 
and accounting (Endicott). 

Athlrd study related to the 
Job market, by Herbert 
Katzensteln of the City Col- 
lege of New York, found 
that the annual mean in- 
come of black male grad- 
uates of the coUege'sclass 
of 1970 is higher than that 
of their white counterparts. 

Mr. Katzensteln found that 
black male graduates had 
an annual mean income 
of $9,670 in 1970, com- 
pared with $8,050 for 
whites. In 1962, blacks 
earned about $5,660 a year 
and whites about $6,110, 
he said.

To The Editor 



"ffrzmkly Speaking" 



by Phil Frcink 



Dear Editor: 

I am referring to the un- 
signed letter to the Editor 
of the January 19 Communi- 
cator. The compari son 
whlchthe writer makes bet- 
ween the capitalist and 
Communist systems Is both 
timely and Interesting. It is 
unfortunate that the con- 
troversial nature of this 
subject evidently led the 
author to wrlteanonymous- 
ly. To my mind this letter 
Is significant because i t 
raises the Important ques- 
tion of the relationship bet- 
ween the individual and 
society. 

One way of evaluating the 
relative success or fail- 
ure of a system is to com- 
pare its avowed principles 
with the actual way of life. 
Its promises with reality. 
O stensibly, freedom, 
equality of opportunity, re- 
spect for the individual, 
progress and happiness 
are among the principles 
which have served as the 
underpinnings of the West- 
ern democracies. In fact, 
the capitalist post-indust- 
rial societies, with their 
emphasis, on productivity, 
consumption and competit- 
tion, have created for their 
citizens another set ofim- 
peratives: the feeling of 
dependence on impersonal 
and anonymous powers, a 
growing disparity between 
the rich and the poor, sub- 
servience to the machine, 
the urge to produce and to 
buy at an accelerated pace, 
with the concomitant pro- 
blems of pollution aliena- 
tion and violence. This 
critique of advanced in- 
dustrial capitalism is aptly 
described in the letter and 
it can be substantiated by 
current events as trans- 
mitted through the media. 

But the letter's idealized 
view of the major Com- 
munist countries is far less 
convincing. While it is true 
that the Soviet Union and 
China succeeded in mod- 
ernizing over a short per- 
iod of time, it is equally 
true that they sacrificed 
the workers, hence the 
Communist ideal of the 
classless society, to the 
new power elite of the party 
bureaucracy. 

Ideological differences 
between the free and the 
Communist worlds notwith- 
standing, the feeling re- 
mains that both sides have 
turned their backs on the 
values and ideals they 
originally proclaimed. 
Which brings me to the 
question posed at the end 
of the letter. "So what is 
the answer?" As I see it, 
the answer is closely re- 
lated to a major function 
of education. For, in order 
to rediscover the purpose 
of democracy, it is essent- 
ial to compare cultures and 
societies, to debate the 
issues, to reexamine fund- 
amental assumptions and 
long - cherished notions. 
Perhaps what is needed. 



most of all, is a revision 
of priorities. Human values 
should outweigh the rights 
of private property, t h e 
spirit of fellowship take the 
place of ruthless competi- 
tion, and the pressures to 
conform should give way 
to a quest for more mean- 
ingful life-styles.

Dear Editor: 

The Student Senate has 
passed a resolution to In- 
vestigate the Parking Fac- 
ilities Account of the Re- 
gional Campus. As a joint 
lU-PU account of monies 
collected from parking sti- 
ckers and fines. Its sole 
purpose is to build future 
parking lots. However, It is 
interesting to note that the 
new parking lot near the li- 
brary was paid for by con- 
struction funds and not the 
Parking Facilities "ac- 
count". One member of the 
Purdue BusinessMan- 
ager's office has comment- 
ed that this particular "ac- 
count" is "not a very act- 
ive one". According to this 
same source this money 
can not be used for the pur- 
chase of present lots, it 
can, however, be used for 
the purchase of an oc- 
casional parking meter. 

Also under consideration 
In the Senate investigation 
is the reason why approx- 
imently 1,700 traffic viola- 
tions havebeen written sin- 
ce the beginning of the fall 
semester. (500 supposedly 
from one particular offic-

er) It is important to real- 
ize that these 1,700 parking 
tickets also mean an addi- 
tional $1,700 in the Park- 
ing Facilities "Account". 
All of these facts have rai- 
sed some very important 
questions concerning the 
use of money collected 
from the faculty, staff and 
the students. According to 
the information that has, 
been Intrusted to the Stu- 
dents' Government, there 
have been no major with- 
drawals from this "ac- 
count" since It began. 
For the past week the Stu- 



dents' Government has been 
requesting more informa- 
tion concerning thisa- 
ccount. They have now 
learned that the Purdue 
Business Manager's office 
has transfered all the ques- 
tionable i nf o r ma t i on to 
Dean Manges. The Stu- 
dents* Government is hope- 
ful to obtain some answers 
concerning the money that 
has been drained from the 
people. It is our money, we 
do have a right to know.

Karl Schweppe 

Every day there are tons 
of unrequested letters sent 
out to the public. These are 
intended to snag some un- 
suspecting soul into buying 
something that he didn't 
want to begin with and pi o- 
bably will not after he gets 
it. What is commonly call- 
ed junk mall is not only 
a form of personal harass- 
ment, but is a fair contri- 
butor to the environmental 
problem. 

For every ton of junk mail 
that is sent out. there are 
about seventeen trees that 
lose their life. There is e- 
nough junk mail sent out 
in this country to encircle 
the earth three times. If 
everyone would take their 
junk mall to a recyclying 
center, our environment 
would be improved. But, 
they don't. There are still 
many people who don't care 
what kind of world they live 



in, or force their fellow 
man to live in. Besides, 
this is Hkeputtingapanun- 
der a leaky faucet. It does- 
n't" solve Che problem, it 
only makes it more beara- 
ble. 

There is a solution to the 
problem that not only helps 
the environment, but will 
stifle the harassment that 
goes with junk mail. Sup- 
posing chat you were to send 
out one hundred letters with 
postage paid, self add- 
ressed envelopes which ad- 
vertised your transistori- 
zed belly button scratcher. 
Then ninety f 1 v e of them 
came back with assorted 1- 
tems of interest whichadd- 
ed additional postage, 
which you had to pay in or- 
der to receive the letter. 
Then you had to pay some- 
one wages to open and ans- 
wer the letters, only to get 
doused with sand, pepper or 
some other undesirable i- 
tem. At this time your staff 



Page 3 

gets angry with you, de- 
mands more money for 
their foul treatment or 
quits all together. Would 
you send out one hundred 
more letters to the same 
people? Now, you're get- 
ting the idea. These post- 
age permit envelopes are- 
n't paid for until they are 
received. Then they are 
paid for by the ounce, much 
as an ordinary letter is. If 
they receive the envelope 
with five ounces of sand or 
scrap paper in It, they have 
to pay postage for five oun- 
ces. Plus, they have to pay 
wages to someone to operv 
and examine Che concents of 
the letter. 

It isn't hard to stop adls- 
agreeable procedure If a 
sizable number of people 
are willing to disrupt the 
process. Besides, isn't ita 
lot of fun to bug someone 
who has bugged you for so 
long?
