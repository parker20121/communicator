Attention 



By Kelly McLendon 



The amvork In question is thai of Willyum Baulkey, a student anist 
who displayed his work. "Poison" al ihe Senior VCD Exhibilion in 
the Visual Ans Gallery on Friday November 14, Since last week, his 
art has been scnilinized by a few people, including an IPFW student who 
I went so far as to call into local WANE T\' News Channel 15. 

The 'concerned smdcni' made incredible claiins that something is amiss 
with Baulkcy's photos, which display crime scenes. In one picture, a woman 
has a phone cord wrapped around her neck and in a different shot; a woman 
has u bleeding throat laceration. Tlie student believed Baulkey s photos in- 
corpiiraie similarities to the murder on campus last April.

"I'm a vvriler loday 
becausL* I was a reader 
as a kid." author David 
Baldacci said, during ihc 
Omnibus Ljjciure Series 
on Friday November 11. 
Literacy was ihe theme 
of the evening as Jerry 
Peterson, President and 
CEO of United Way Allen 
County arrived on stage 
before the lecture to in- 
troduce a new communi- 
ty initiative called LEARN 
UNITED. Peterson said 
it's important for "every- 
one to enjoy (be true joy 



of reading." 

II was fitting lo an- 
nounce the new program 
at this particular lecture, 
as Baldacci is an avid 
literacy advocate him- 
self. He even has his own 
foundation, The Wish 
You Well group, which 
funds reading programs 
for children, adults and 
seniors. 

Baldacci feels that 
being literate is impor- 
tant because, "we are 
quickly becoming a na- 
tion where the people 
who don't know how to 
read are outnumbering 
tlie people who do know 
how to read." 

After the introduc- 



tion, Baldacci came out 
on stage, seemingly jolly 
and ready to entenain 
the crowd with bis lec- 
ture. He began by joking 
about why so many law- 
yers seem to be writing 
fiction novels these days. 
This spurned a laugh or 
two from the audience. 

The author then 
launched right into how 
he became a writer in the 
first place. He started by 
sending out short stories 
to magazines like The 
New Yorker and Atlantic 
Monthly. These submis- 
sions, however, were re- 
turned with many rejec- 
tions, 

Baldacci was able 



Free chicken and show brings 
excitement to Stomping Grounds 



By Kelly Mclendon 

SIsKWiDet 



Student Antliony 
Decker was getting ready 
to eat the turkey sand- 
wich he packed for lunch 
on Tliursday November 
13, but changed his mind 
when he saw the Student 
Activity Board setting up 
to give out free Cliick- 
Fil-A. T^TJically. Decker 
brings his own lunch to 
eat in the basement of 
Walb, also known as The 
Stomping Grounds, but 
today was the e.\ccp- 
tion. "You just can't pLiss 
up Chick-Fil-A for fn?u 
Decker said, as he stood 
in the line. 

Thefood forSlomping 
Gnaunds II was supposed 
to start at 11:30 AM, but 
there was a minor delay 
and it wasn't until fif- 
teen minutes later that 
a Chick-Fil-A manager 
showed up with the food. 
Instead of just dropping 
off the food, the manager 
stayed around and even 
walked through the line 
shaking people's hands 



and encouraging them 
to use a coupon the next 
lime diey visited the res- 
taurant location. 

The free food includ- 
ed a chicken sandmch, 
a bag of Lay's original 
potato chips and also, 
a brownie. Free drinks 
were also provided by the 
Student Activities Board, 
The entertainment for 
the event was David 



Campbell, a guitarist 
from Bloomington. Af- 
ter playing |ohn Mayer's 
"Wailing on die World 
to Change" and Oasis's 
"Wonderwall," Campbell 
encouraged the audience 
to shout out their favorite 
songs, in the hopes that 
he could cover them.

to find a bright side to 
the negative responses, 
though. He regarded re- 
jection letters as merely 
badges of honor, only 
out there to dissuade the 
passionate from going 
through with a dream. 

In his speech, Balda- 
cci pointed out that the 
life ofabestselting author 
isn't necessarily all glam. 
It's just average, as like 
anyone else's. The writer 
is currently on lour for 
his newest book. Divine 
Justice, which Is ranked 
as #1 on The New York 



Times Bestsellers for this 
week. 

Baldacci's tvriting has 
taken him many places. 
He candidly described 
a book tour trip to Italy 
and how be was asked lo 
change his last name for 
:he bookcovers to be sold 
in that country. The Ital- 
ian book publisher said 
it was because Italians 
don't think other Italians 
write good enough, so 
they won't usually buy a 
book written by an Ital- 
ian. He had to change 
his Italian last name of 



Baldacci to something 
ultra-American, The au- 
thor chose "Ford," know- 
ing that name sounded 
majorly American, due to 
the car industry. There- 
fore, when his book. "Ab- 
solute Power" was intro- 
duced in Italy, it was by 
David Ford. 

In the end, the Bal- 
dacci lecture was what 
all the advertisements 
promised it to be. a sus- 
penseful thriller - full of 
wistful anecdotes and 
stories.

people and 'I Indiana 
Slate Legislators.

about why each chose to alumna and cur- 
attend IPFW. Panelists rent IPFW Wriling Cen-

Ill Relations Inierim Di- 
rt'Cior Kimberly Wagner 
hosted the program and 
moderated the panel. 

rhc panel cited various 
strL'ogths uf IPFW, while 
iioiing the number of 
academic programs, con- 
tinued growth, new .stu- 
dent housing, the Summit 
League, the Holiday Inn, 
and the new pedestrian 
bridge. The panel's vision 
of IPFW's future keyed 
to more of the same and 
noted the importance of 
adequate state funding. 

Some examples in- 
cluded more academic 
programs at undergradu- 
ate and graduate levels, 
more traditional campus 
attributes typical of non- 
commuter schools, insti- 
tuting a Student Learning 



Commons, possibly on 
the second floor of the 
Helmke Library, and be- 
ing a bridge where tra- 
ditional and non-tradi- 
tional students can learn 
together. 

The legislators high- 
lighted the world- 
"^ class status that 
IPFW has earned, the 
importance of con- 
tinued support at the 
Capitol in Indianapo- 
lis, and the pride tfiey 
_ have in IPFW. 

Panelist Travis 
Barnes, ex- Marine, said, 
-IPFW is the best bang 
for the buck." Sen. Kruse 
said he remembers when 
he was an IPFW student

This semester is 
quickly approaching its 
end, however there Is 
still a lot going on fur the 
average student. Many 
are busy ^vriling papers, 
studying for exams, and 
trying to keep up with ev- 
erything else that a per- 
son deals with In life. At 
this point In the semes- 
ter a lot of us sometimes 
struggle to even show 
up lo class. [ have days 
when.' I find myself com- 
pletely unmotivated by 
every aspect of college. 
Because this general at- 
titude can keep ntttdcnis 
from doing the best they 
can, 1 feel it would be a 
nice time to remind ev- 
eryone just why we are 
going through the mad- 
ness that is higher edu- 
cation. 

I understand and 
appreciate the value of 
education and all of the 
positive influences it can 
make on our world. Col- 
lege is about more than 
simply getting a piece of 
paper to help find a job 
later in life. It is more 



than just (toing through 
ihf inoiions because so 
ni,iny people utRC you to. 
I (liiiatinn Is about hei- 
tiririg yourself and tliose 
.iioiindyou. 

Wlien I struggle to

Don't get me wrong, I am 
not trying to knock peo- 
ple who don't attend col- 
lege. I believe everyone 
should better themselves 
through education in the 
way that suits them best. 
That could be college, 
trade school, military 
service, ora mullilitde of 
other opportunities. 

I guess the overall 
point 1 am trying tn make 
Is (hut while college can 
definitely have it's high 
and low points It Is well 
worth the effort. A future 
full of bolter-educated 
people seems a lot more 
peaceful and happy than 
one lead by those who 
aren't. This should be 
motivation enough for 
anyone to do the best 
they can to achieve excel- 
lence through continued 
learning. 1 will conclude 
by wishing everyone 
good luck with the rest of 
the semester. 



Doors Close on a Fort Wayne Coffee Fix 



By Peter Schnellenburger 

St3tfWritfr 



The doors of the 
Hi!l-0-Beans (formally 
known as The Dragon's 
Keep Cafe) closed for the 
last time in Waynedale. 
Why did a business that 
has thrived for roughly 
two and a half years, die 
in SLX months? 

We went to ask 
George Webber, oivner 
of the Hill-0-Beans, ex- 
acdy what happened lo 
his business, in hopes 
that college students can 
learn from his experienc- 
eSv When asked about 
what \s'ent wrong. George 



said, that he just didn't 
have enough costum- 
ers. "I've always said 
that we need to make 
300 dollars a day to stay 
aHoat, that's 40 people 
spending S5 a piece." A 
business's greatest as- 
set is its costumers; it's 
how they make money 
and without them they 
die. So ivhy didn't they 
have costumers? 

It sure ivasn't their 
products. The HUl-O- 
Beans, had the widest 
variety of coffees and 
teas available in town. 
They were theonly place 
in town to sell the highly 
caffeinaied Turkish cof- 
fee and Dragon's Flow- 
er tea. One first time 



costumer mentioned, "I 
heard this place has the 
best lunch in town..." 

Unfortunately George 
wasn't able to advertise. 
the capital just wasn't 
there for it. He said it 
was like a Catch 
22. "You have to 
advertise 
to make 
mon- 
ey, but 
you 
have lo 
make money to 
advertise,' 

He said that he thought 
that the coffee shop's 
site would help with that 
problem. The Hill-A- 
Beans was location on 
Lower Huntington Road, 




a major artery through 
the South Side of Fori 
Wayne. Then after a year 
of business the city start- 
ed construction on Ar- 
dmore Drive, and many 
of the small businesses 
on fjQwer Hunting- 
ton Road began to 
suffer. Poieniial 
customers 
had lo take 
a detour to 
get lo and 
from work. 
Soon after 
the road 
was finished, 
the coffee shop was 
dealt a devastating blow 
with the decline of the 
economy. 

George said that was 



part of the reason why 
he decided to change the 
name from The Dragon's 
Keep Cafd to HillO- 
Beans. With the econo- 
my in recess and lack of 
costumers, something 
drastic had to be done, 
not to mention the fact 
the public didn't know 
what the Dragon's Keep 
was. 

George said, 'People 
thought we were either 
a Chinese restaurant or a 
gamer shop, even though 
Coffee Shop was painted 
in big letters on the store 
firont window.' 

The best advice he 
can give to any aspir- 
ing business owner is to 
know youi produa and 



how lo market it. The 
good news is that George 
plans to reopen his cof- 
fee shop in six months, 
and continue to provide 
affordable quality coffee 
and teas to Fort Wayne. 

In times like these 
mom and pop shops are 
hit the hardest, and the 
facts are that in 2007 
neariy 88 perceni of all 
new businesses closed in 
their first year, according 
to http;//appl.sba.gov/. 
One of the best ways lo 
help the economy this 
holiday season it to stop 
by your local mom and 
pop shop and ^ve the 
^ft that keeps on 0v- 
ing by supporting small 
business.

Obama Message Breakdown 

Understanding the president elect's 
message of hope and change 



By Dan Jehl 

staff Writer 



Before the votes were 
all counti^d, the talking 
heiicis of radio airwaves 
and alphabet soup ncl- 
works were doing non- 
slop election celebration 
analysis paralysis. Fori 
Wayne's AM talk radio 
is predicting public dis- 
illusionment, 
Limbaugh's talk- 
ing about low- 
ering expecta- 
tions, and lesse' 
lackson's point- 
ing oul realistic 
expectations. . 
The dynamics of 
Washington politics are 
not cracks in the Obama 
path of hope and change 
armor but realistic warn- 
ings to be heeded and 
dealt with. 

On election night, 
i'ort Wayne AM radio 
WOWO's Pat While 
said: "This new genera- 
tion who elected Obama 
as president will now 
be disillusioned about 
Washington politics." 
The ver&gt;' nest morning, 
talk show celebrity Rush into a di- 
Umbaugh said: "Obama saster. 
is trjing to lower expec- 
tations. He's not telling 
us any specifics." Lim- 
baugh was criticizing 
the lack of specitics in 
ihe Wclory speech when 
people's expectations of 
him are sky high. 

~" ;vening 



ican lo run for president 
while New York's Shirley 
Chisholm was the first. 
Jackson said: "Obama 
has brought high expec- 
tations. We're now going

sense that he will repre- 



Jackson explained 
that momentum for 
Obama in Washington 



"The difference today is

win despite historical barriers 

like race or creed or sex" 



will he countered with a 
back and forth, ebb and 
flow. Obama won't get 
everything and the pub- 
lic needs to understand 
this. 

So let's say it: IF the 
public doesn't em- 
brace Obama'i

tlien this his- 
toricwinand 
'defining 
moment"

If the

message. The best way is 
go lo the source, Obama 
himself rather than all 
the political pundits los- 
ing sight and perspective 
of the forest by fixating 
on trees. Obama said his 
message is one of hope 
and one of change. 

"Hope" and "change" 
is what Barack Obama 
is all about. Along with 
this, Obama raises the 
bar and invites in- 
dividual responsi- 
bility for each and 
everyone. 

In his elec- 
tion night speech, 
' Obamasaid, "Tliis 

victory alone is 
not the change we 
seek. Tt is the chance for 
thai change." Further. 
he said, "the government 
cannot solve all our prob- 
lems." Adding, "1 ask yi m 
to join with me." 

Obama is not prom- 
ising a rose garden. It's 
a chance for

work and accept the re- 
sponsibility. 

He cautioned there 
are no instant or easy 
results and said. "We 
may not get there in one 
year or even one term. 
Bui America I have nev- 
er been more hopeful." 
This is the essence of the 
Obama message of hope 



and change. 

Obama is not saying 
he's doing it alone and 
people can now go back 
to bed. He's asking for 
people to join not only 
to carry the hope and 
change message but to 
live it. Obama is doing a 
47-year renewal of Presi- 
dent John R Kennedy's 



Ask not what the coun- 
try can do for you, but 
what you can do for your 
country." 

The difference today 
is Obama proved each 
person can win despite 
historical barriers like 
race or creed or sex. 
Maybe this time "yes we 
can" is real.

Drive through Memory Lane 

Photojournalists, Peter and Dauid Turnley reminisce at Fort Wayne Museum of Art 



By Said EL-Dajani 

Editoi-in-CMel 
Op-id 

The memory of my 
father handing me his 
Pentax Z-l film camera 
in a helicopter circling an 
active Hawaiian volcano 
is vivid. As the flashbulb 
reminiscence turned to 
day dream, I had to re- 
mind myself that I was 
listening to photojour- 
nalist, David Tumley tell 
the story of his first cam- 
era. The same camera 
was shared with his twin, 
photojoumalist, Fort 
Wayne native, and Pu- 
litzer Prize winner, Peter 
Tumley. 

Speaking at the Fort 
Wayne Museum of Art 
on Friday, Nov. 15, the 
brothers took turns tell- 
ing their story. Dbcuss- 
ing individual photo- 
graphs they had taken 
throughout the years, the 
evening slowly became 
more than just another 
lecture in another city. 

"When I'm with you 
guys, I feel like I can tell 
you a zillion things." said 
David. 

Though their work 
over the last three de- 
cades has been a critical 



preview of significant 
events, political figures, 
and cultural and reli- 
gious icons. Fort Wayne 
had been a foundation 
for their careers. 

Sitting among the au- 
dience were old friends 
and photo enthusiasts. 
Most fascinating was the 
attendance of a few who 
had been in the Ibrn- 
leys' first collaborative 
project, McCleUanSlreet, 
An American Neighbor- 
hood. 

McCleUan Street has 
for some years now, been 
an inspiration to me. 
There has always been 
a discipline in photog- 
raphy that I have always 
appreciated. There is a 
demand for comfort and 
confidence. Your subjects 
aren't inanimate objects, 
they have feelings, per- 
sonalities, ambitions. 

When photographer, 
Bruce Davidson was at 
Saint Francis last year I 
was elated. According to 
a research presentation I 
had done on the Tumley 
brothers a few years back, 
it was Bruce Davidson's 
work. East lOOth Street, 
that set the tone for Mc- 
Oellan Street 

Admiring the nature 
of people and exploring 



the human condition 
has been a central theme 
in both Davidson's and 
the TXirnley's work. Their 
photographs have told 
stories of people, exploit- 
ing their socioeconomic 
situations and giving 
light to matters that 
would other wise con- 
cern, maybe no one. 

Then, to see the same 
people photographed in 
1973 stand next to a work 
of themselves in the gal- 
lery was what reminded 
me of why I loved the 
Tbmleys work ■ their ap- 
preciation for people and 
the acknowledgment of 
human vulnerability. 

Their message of 
traditional upbringing 
paired with global insight 
was crucial and timely, 
considering a conserva- 
tive and sheltered audi- 
ence. Emphasizing the 
importance of civic re- 
sponsibility and a more 
unified worid, there was 
a sense diat the brothers 
were trying to reach out 
to a community still bur- 
dened by ignorance and 
segregation. 

McCleWm Street is 
currently in exhibition at 
(he Fort Wayne Museum 
of An throu^ Jan. 11, 
2009.

Save Money, Stay Stylish 

Bundling up economically for the winter season 



By Hana Hawash 

CoflUibuting Wntf c 



Saving money and 
staying stylish do not al- 
wax's come hand in hand, 
but witli the new winter 
fashion season rapidly 
approaching. students 
find their closets lack- 
ing in warm yei stylish 
clothes. Some of the fiinc- 
tional-stylish clothes diat 
college students generally 



wear include wool or big 
puf^ coats, scarves, hats. 
glo\'es. soft sweaters, 
jeans and fuzzy boots, a 
winter staple of the fash- 
ion forward female. Ev- 
erywhere you go you can 
find the new \N-inier fash- 
ion trends. From Wal- 
Mart to Fote\'er21. there 
is an abundance of stores 
with low prices on high 
fashion. 

V\^-Mart is a super

IPFW production, Two Rooms, 
delivers conflict, controversy 




By Mark Cox 



The IPFW Department 

of Theater is now present- 
ing 1\vo Rooms, directed 
by Jeffrey Casazza. an eye- 
opening play that shows 
the hardships and agony 
of terrorism during war 
and how it affects family 
and those involved. 

TXvo Rooms was 
originally set during the 
;an Era during the 
Iran-Conlra affair. Many 
innocent citizens were 
taken captive and held for 
ransom, most notably the 
52 employees of the Unit- 
ed Slates embassy in Irgn. 

Over the last few years 
of his presidency, arrange- 
ments were made without 
the consent of Reagan to 
irade arms to Iran in con- 
nection iviih releasing 
prisoners of war. The play 
is changed slighdy to de- 
pict the war under Bush 
Ir.'s presidency during the 
War in Iraq. 

Two Rooms focuses on 
.Michael I Ion Kasunic). an 
-American professor tak- 
en hostage in Beirut; his 
wife. Lainte (Elizabeth M- 
berdingl, spends her days 
back in the United States 
awaiting his release and 
safe return home after 
three years. 

There are two rooms: 



Michael's in Beirut and 
Lainie's in ihe US, over 
10,000 miles apart. Mi- 
chael is being tortured in 
a bare room in Beirut by 
Shi'ite Muslims and oc- 
casionally moved from 
one building lo another 
to keep from him being 
intercepted by other fac- 
tionsorAmerican soldiers. 
Lainie spends the most of 
her days in a room— when 
not watching wildlife ai 
the marsh — stripped of 
all furnishings except for 
a small, rectangular rug, 
which was once Michael's 
office space. 

Lainie is very peciJiar 
of whom she lets into the 
room — only two ever en- 
ter throughout the play: 
Ellen (Tamara CumminsI 
and Walker (Chad Ken- 
nerk). Ellen is the govern- 
ment social worker desig- 
nated to Michael's case, 
and every week goes lo 
Lainie's confined prison- 
like space to inform her 
of news thai has formed 
about the hostage situa- 
tion at hand. Walker, on 
the other hand, is a rc- 
porier for a local newspa- 
per and is trying to con- 
vince Lainie to break out 
of her silent shell and try 
to start controversy which 
would lead to the bargain- 
ing with Shi'ite people to 
release Michael safely. 



There Is conflict be- 
tween Ellen and Walker, 
both having conflict- 
ing agendas: Ellen wants 
families of the impris- 
oned to keep quiel about 
the situation, saying thai 
only harm can he done 
by speaking out and de- 
manding answers thai 
were avoided by "secret" 
operations of the govern- 
ment; Walker wants Lain- 
ie to spill her guts and get 
an exclusive interview 
with her while getting the 
public involved with the 
controversy, arguing that 
it may save her husband. 



It is between these 
two rooms that LafnIc 
and Michael live their 
lives everyday— hoping, 
grieving, and frying to 
keep themselves together, 
They begin lettering their 
spoken letters to each 
other about how things 
are, where they are al and 
how ihey arc both having 
a hard time coping with 
Michael's capture. After 
three years, f^inic final- 
ly goes public with ihe 
long-term capture of her 
husband and wanLs to do 
anything within her pow- 
er to gel him home safely

Surprisingly Campbell 
knew a good deal of 
songs from a wide array 
ofartisls.Whilelhe event 
was lacking in audience 
participation for the 
most part, a few people 
did shout oul requests.

array of brightly colored 
sweaters for the fall and 
winter season thai can 
be purchased for any- 
where from fifteen to 
thirty dollars. They also 
have coats, scarves, hats 
and gloves Ihai are all 
fashionably affordable. 
Even more styles can be 
found on the website. 

Anotherctothingstore 
with a fashion sense is 
Kohls, which has clothes 
and shoes for the entire 
family. They do have high 
priced lines such as Vera 
Wang for women, and 
Chaps for men, but there 
is always a sale and after 
season clearances of up 
to eighty percent off of 
the original price. The big 
sale al Kohls, happening 
ihrough November 22nd, 
is the Christmas sale, 
with up to fifty percent 
off of the entire stock. 
Along with sales like this, 
there is a mailing list that 
sends coupons by mail 
or email. 

"V-Neck sweaters 
wilh button downs." Os- 
maan Syed (IPFW 12) 
said when asked about 
his favorite winter style. 

Kohls is one of the 
best places to find good 
quality, fashionable 

clothes for men, espe- 
cially button down shirts 
and sweaters. They have 
an assortment of styles, 
ranging from profes- 
sional suits by Haggar lo 
skater clothes by Tony 
Hawk. The shoe depart- 



ment also has an array of 
styles of the whole fam- 
ily, with an assortment of 
stylish boots for those of 
us in college who cannot 
afford the hefiy price of 
Uggs. The most impor- 
tant thing about Kohls is 
that Ihey are constantly 
updating their seasons 
and fashion trends, keep- 
ing up with what comes 
from the runway. 

'I try to mu my last 
year clothes wilh this 
years lo save money but 
still have a stylish out-

(IPFWl2)said. 

Mixing new pieces 
wilh prior years cloth- 
ing is a great way to 
money while still hav- 
ing this years' new look. 
Another great option to 
save a little of that hard- 
earned cash is to sell 
your gently used name- 
brand clothes to Plalos 
closet, which is located 
off of Coldwater near |o- 
Anns. Selling clothes is 
a good option for those 
who like to stay fashion 
updated and would like 
to get rid of old clothes 
while shopping for new 
styles. 

The best part of all of 
these stores, other than 
the facl thai they are all 
reasonably priced and 
fashion fonvard, is that 
they can all be found 
within five minute drive 
from the IPI^ campus, 
which wiL save even 
more money on gas.

There are certain things 
to be said about Stomp- 
ing Grounds events. 
First, is that the food will 
be late. But second is the 
faci that the songs and 
enienainment will be 
great. The Student Activi- 
ties Board did not disap- 
point with their choice 
of Campbell this time 
around. 
When Campbell began 



10 sing lason Mraz's "I'm 
Yours," people at sur- 
rounding tables began 
singing along. Overall, 
going to the Stomp- 
ing Grounds events are 
worthwhile. Pius, you 
don't have to waste mon- 
ey buying lunch thai day. 
The next time the Stu- 
dent Activity Board of- 
fers a Stomping Grounds 
concert, check it out. It's 
worth your time. 



FromPage4 



Ix is imponant to "get" 
what the Obama mes- 
sage is not. It is not about 
handouts -namely, a new 
house, free heaJthcats, 
new job, and free college 
education. It is not about 
government solving all 
our problems and soon. 
It is not about redistribu- 
tion of wealth so there 
is equal wealth or about 
Obama doing it oil or by 
himself. 

Yet it means all people 
regardless of race, color, 
creed or gender will haw 



a more equal and fair 
chance at oppominity. It 
means barriers to equal- 
ity and discriminatory 
obstacles ivill come down 
one by one- It means the 
values of human rights 
and of civil rights will be 
cherished and pursued. 

If the people don't "get 
it," as the non-Obama- 
phytes predict, disillu- 
sionment will replace 
hope for change. Alien- 
ation and polarization 
will continue. Today's 
renewed and energized 



hope will wither away 
becoming why bother 
when things are still the 
same. Yes we can. but we 
didn't, so screw iL 

This need not hap- 
pen. 

As the Obama family 
searches for a puppy and 
pack for the nation's ex- 
ecutive mansion built by 
sla\'es. the pubLc needs 
to search for, and em- 
brace the meaning of the 
Obama message. 




New Fad in the World of Wireless 



By Craig Lloyd 

staff Wntct 



Ttchol iv«ob logtpo L CO 



DVD/CD drive. To have tasks like surf the web, 
a peak at the Asus NIOI check e-mail, and type 



Laptops seem like the 
default item that a col- 
lege student would have 
these days because of its 
portability and endless 
word processing powers. 
In today's fast- 
paced world, it's 
not about porta- 
bility anymore, 
it's about ultra- 
portability. That 
brings us to the 
netbook. What 
exactly is a net- ^^^ 
book you ask? 

Netbooks are basi- 
cally really small laptops. 
They're a littie bigger 
than a DVD case really. 
The first netbook was 
released just under a 
year ago. Since then, net- 
books have been gaining 
popularity, and many 
companies are starting 
10 be a part of the net- 
book fad, including HP 
I tried one out at Best 
Buy, and I have to say, 
they're cute little things. 
I did research on a spe- 
cific netbook made by 
Asus, a PC component 
manufacturer. It's their 
NIOI model and it sells 
for S780 (oUier models 
sell for less than S300) 
It comes with a 1.6GHz 
Intel processor, 2GB 
of memory, 320GB of 
hard drive storage, 
and a 10" widescreen 
display It also sports 
a webcam, Wi-Fi, 
and 3 USB pons, 
but it does not have a 



Netbook, go to www.ti- 
nyurl.com/asusnetbook. 
Why the name "net- 
book" though? Basically, 
netbooks are more prac- 
tical and useful when 
internet is implemented 
to them. They simply 
become worthless, i 
descript devices when 
internet access is 
available. This might be books simply cannot do 
^^—- — ^ rrr — ■ — all this. I have 

if s not about portability nothing wrong 

with that and I 
would purchase 
a nelbook any 
day, but internet 
is the key for net- 
books. Without 
it, there would 



up papers, although, 
few high-end netbooks 
are an exception. For ex- 
ample, on my HP laptop, 
I usually do a lot of multi- 
tasking. Sometimes I 
have music playing while 
I'm editing photos with 
Adobe Photoshop or I 
play a game or two and 
watch movies. Most nel- 



anymore, it 's about ultra- 
portability" 



an obvious statement, be no web surfing and 
but it's actually a very no e-mail checking. So 
insightful observation, you're pretty much stuck 



Netbooks simply do not 
have enough process- 
ing power lo do heavy 
work on. They only have 
enough juice to do daily 



with viTiting papers, and 
I know any college stu- 
dent would not want to 
be in that situation.

Taking big risl&lt;s will result in big reward 

SOOHBn OR LATER 



In All Directions - OpEd 



By Dan Vance 
vance-iad.blogspot.C( 



TOP: Only a freshman, Trey McCorkle (pictured 
vs. Olivet) shined at Xavier. A few more bright 
spots could set off an upset for IPFW soon. 

BOTTOM: Headache nights for Dane Fife, like 
against Xavier, will hopefully get fewer and 
furthur between. 



ir &gt;-oti are a fnn of IPFW baskelball (especially a 
nL-w fan), this past Friday's openers for ibe school 
probably left ymi thinking "please God. let there be a 
method lo this madness!' 

And I can't blame you. 

The women opened wiih a 20-poin[ loss to an 
Illinois team that won 20 games just a season ago. That 
coupled with the fact they are from the Big IQ (one of 
college sports' traditionally toughest conferences!, 
makes you wonder why we bothered. 

And hey. then we have the men. 10 new faces and 
the season is opened visiting a Xavier team that is far 
and away projected to win the Atlantic- ID conference 
and oh yeah- ihey also were in the Elite Eight last 
NCAA Tournament, two wins from a national title 
game. 

IPFW lost 71-43, in part because the 
team scored only 14 points in the first 
half, as compared to iheir 13 first half 
fouls. 

And when you look at the remainder 
of each teams non- conference 

schedule, it doesn't seem any sunnier. 

The women's side sounds lighter to the common fan 
with Miami of Ohio, St. Bonaventure and Iowa State: 
but is tough as nails in it's own right. Meanwhile the 
men get joyful roadtrips to Marquette, Purdue and 
Nebraska. 

Not to mention thai big welcome to Michigan State, 
who have trounced the Mastodons every single time 
they have ever played, including a sadly close (I assure 
you, the score was deceiving) 81-68 win in 2001. 

But there arc two very convincing reasons why 
scheduling these type of "I feel like I just got run over 
by a bus" games is smart. 

One, it's good business. Commonly known as 
"guarantee games," heading to powerhouse schools 
brings in money to the university. That's why schools 
like Presbyterian bother going to Duke when diey 
know that they will lose by 50. 




Bui the mam thing is simple; the bi^cr ihc risk In 
lift, ihe bigger the potential re\vard. .•Viid the reward 
for knocking off a Michigan State or Purdue is just 
about as sweet as it gets for n program like IPFW 
without an actual trophy being hniilved, 

A win like that won't guiinmlce you a shot ni the 
NCA/\ Tournament or anything. But what It does give 
you is notoriety, recruiting power and brngging rights 
beyond be lief. 

Arguably IPFW men's hnskelball's biggest win came 
in 2004 when Pavid Simon st.irn-d \\n- nionili o( 
DccemberwilhalG point, lOrvbnuiKliniiin^ili.ii led 
lo a 64-59 upset over Utah Stale al ilii' (.dliMiini. A 
few months iaier, IISU was in the big dance. No, thai 
win didn't put us there, but it was just a little taste of 
how close a win over a lountament team makes you 
feel like you arc. 

A win over a power school would make It that much 
sweeter. 
Back in I^OOG, then fellow Independent [and 

current Summit l.e.igue mate) Norih 

Dakota Slate pulled ofl' one of college 
basketball's greatest tcccni upsets 
when they knocked off nationally- 
ranked t) 1 5 Wisconsin, A furious 
Badger comeback in that game still 
wasn't enough as NDSU won 62-5S. 

^^ And just lilie that, people look notice 

of North Dakota State. I won't say that it was the only 
reason why the Bison earned conference affillailon 
five months later, but it was certainly a defining 
moment. 

A win over Michigan State or any of the well-known 
teams on the schedule would do good things for 
IPFW. We don't need conference affiliation anymore, 
but the peaking inlercst that a big win would bring is 
always welcome. 

Eventually, that will come. And that Is the point of 
putting together a tough non-conference schedule. 
This team, that showed their glaring weaknesses In 
a loss to Xavier, may not beat Michigan Stale in 2008. 
But a lesson learned in 2000 could mean all of the 
difference in 2009. 

I personally would say that is a reward worth taking 
a few risks for.

of the second half, as Illinois increased their lead to 
.J2 at 56-24. IPl'W made a furious late-game rally, 
scoring the final 10 points of the game over the final

victory.

light contest in the early going. 

In the first half, Xavier used ihcir size advantage to 
score 20 points in the paint while taking a 37-14 lead
