Reward still offered 



By Gail Ruble Crawford 
News Editor 



DPFW sludeni Marcy L. 
Klotz, 19, was arrested on 
Dec. 10, 1997. on two 
counts of false reporting 
and informing in connec- 
tion with two of the 20- 
plus bomb threats that occurred dur- 
ing the fall semester. 

If convicted, Klotz could face a 
minimum one year sentence and a 
$10,000 fine. False reporting and 
informing is a Class D felony. 

Klotz was initially held in the 
Allen County Lockup on $2,500 
bond for each count before being 
released at 12:30 p.m. Dec. 10, on 
S5.000 bond. 

IPFW received more than 20 
bomb threats during the fall semes- 
ter. This includes two during finals 
week, which was after Klotz had 
been arrested. Students and faculty 
were beginning to complain about 
the recurring class interruptions 
when a 55,000 reward was offered 
for help in the capture of the suspect. 
According to the Affidavit of 
Probable Cause filed in Allen 
Superior court on Dec. 9, Klotz is 
accused of reporting "by telephone, 
telegraph, mail, or other written or 
oral communication that the person 
or another person had placed or 
intended to place an explosive or 
other destructive substance in a 
building or transportation facility, to 
wiL by reporting by telephone on 
said date (Oct. 23 and 27] that a 
bomb had been placed in a building 
on the Indiana University-Purdue 
University at Fort Wayne campus... 
knowing the report to be false." 



On the dates in question, Oct. 23 
and 27, the Affidavit states that "on 
or about the 23rd of October, 1997, 
an unknown individual described as 
female placed a call to the 
Classroom Medical Building of the 
IPFW campus and slated that there 
was a bomb in the building that 
would delonate at approximately 
11:00 ajn. The building was cleared 
and no explosive was found. 

"On or about the 27th of 
October, 1997. a phone call came in 
to Kettler Hall from a female indi- 



" Hopefully 
student(s) involved 
will see this is no 
joke. Ifs a Class D 
Felony, and will fol- 
low them for life. 
This is serious." 



vidua! staling thai a bomb was in 
Kettler Hall and would go off at 
10:00 a.m. Again, the building was 
cleared and no explosive device was 
found" 

Klotz's arrest came after two 
separate individuals reported to 
IPFW Police and Safety on Nov. 21 
that each had information related to 
these specific bomb threats 

"We had enough information 
that the (county) prosecutor charged 
her with iwo counts. We had been 



following up leads that pointed in 
her direction for a long time. We 
have several witnesses," said Lauren 
DenHanog, Chief of IPFW Police 
and Safely. 

A S5000 reward had been 
offered beginning in late November 
in the hopes of calching the per- 
son(s) responsible. This will not be 
awarded unless the information 
leads to an arrest and conviction of 
the person(s) responsible for the 
threats. 

Since an arrest has occurred, 
DenHartog is quick to make clarifi- 
cations about the S5000 reward. 

"If someone else had more 
information about this case, ihe 
reward would be split amongst the 
informers. If ihe information wasn't 
related to the same case, a separate 
$5000 total reward would still stand. 
If a group of people reported infor- 
mation on one particular suspect, ihe 
reward would be splil amongst 
them, Unrelated person, separate 
rewards. But this is only rewarded if 
the information leads to an arrest 
and conviction." 

Currently. IPFW Police and 
Safely are following up on more 
leads. Accordingly, they would like 
to make one message clear io all: 

"We warn the message to get out 
that we're not playing around with 
this. If we can find enough evidence 
lo charge [someone], then we'll 
charge [them]. This is a serious 
crime. 

"Hopefully studenl(s) involved 
will see thai this is no joke. It's a 
Class D Felony, and will follow 
them for life. This is serious." 

If you have any information aboul 
ihe bomb threats, call the University 
Police at 481-6911. 



Students work at Karrington House 



By Oooie Miller 
Chief Reporter 



Although generations apart, four 
IPFW students and a group of senior 
citizens at Karrington House 
Assisted Living Cenier have found a 
way lo bridge the generation gap. 

The four students involved are 
taking an Introduction to Human 
Services course. As part of their 
studies, the students musi interact 
with some residents of Karringion 
House and complete a "Growing 
Up" booklet 

The book will cover information 
from the residents' early years. It 
will include everything from jobs 
ihey have held in the past, to what 
son of Christmas traditions they 
observed as children. 

After Iheir initial hesitation, ihe 
sludents thought the clinical require- 
ment was a greal idea. 

"It was interesting io see because 
we lake things for granied." said 
student Heidi Hockemeyer. "We 



know our mothers' maiden names 
and stuff like that, but for ihem, i( 
was harder io remember." 

"It's a great siie, I like 
being there," she adds. 

A source of inspiration for Heidi, 
was Linda Wheeler, former IPFW 
graduate and currently Activities 
Director at Karringion House. 

"Having Linda there was great, 
because she had already gone 
ihrough ihe program," Heidi said. 

Wheeler developed the idea of 
having Human Services students 
perform their clinical at Karringion 
House. The booklei is a social his- 
tory done in fill-in-ihe-blank formal. 
"It's a good program," Wheeler 
said "Older people gel io interact 
with ihe younger generation and 
ihey (older people) get one-on-oDe 
attention." 

Wheeler, who graduated from 
IPFW seven years ago, has been at 
Karrington House since August 
The clinical has another benefit for 
the Karringion residents: it forces 
Ihem to reminisce, which is espe- 
cially important for Alzheimer's 
palienis. 

She also notes thai while students 



were worried at first that they 
would nol know what Ihey were 
doing, the residents have been 
excited since the first meeiing 
Now, however, both sides are 
pleased with the outcome of the pro- 
ject. 

The four students involved in the 
project are in classes held by associ- 
ate professors Carol Lctscrson and 
Bob Hawley. Sludents have (o be 
placed in a clinical site relative to 
the class they are taking. 

"I think students have learned 
respect for older citizens and respect 
for iheir contributions," said 
Leiserson. 

Leiserson also found that stu- 
dents really enjoyed their assign- 
ment. She is thankful for the role 
Karrington played in seeing that the 
students were supervised so (hat 
everything went smoothly. 

"I appreciate Iheir supervision of 
our studenis in their beautiful facili- 
ty," she said. 

These Karrington residents will 
have a life history that they can pass 
along to their families now, or save 
to serve as an heirloom later. 




Another semester begins with the usual book-buying rush at Follett's.

To clone or not to clone 



The scientific community 
has come upon a line drawn in the 
sand and once il is crossed, there is 
no going back Thai line is cloning. 
The idea of cloning was first 
introduced in sci-fi movies, but now 
the idea has found its way (o [he 
forefront of the last decade of the 
century. 

For some, the issue of cloning is 
a great stride for the scientific com- 
munity, but for most it is an uneasy 
and scary idea. 

After the announcement by 
American scientist Richard Seed 
thai he will clone a human within 
iwo years. 19 European nations 
signed a treaty condemning human 
cloning. 

President Clinton has joined ihe 
forces and is urging Congress to fol- 
low the European example. 

First of all. we believe thai the 
new technology needs to be further 
and repeatedly lested. There were 
many failures before Dolly, the infa- 
mous cloned sheep, came to be. It is 
a Iremendou: 



leap from sheep 
to humans 
Why nol try il 
on other large 
animals firsl? 
For instance 
bison or ele- 
phants. We 
think thai ihis 
should be done 
a considerable 
amount of 
times, success- 
fully, before 
there is any hint 
of an attempt to 
clone humans. 

Secondly, 
we believe that 
babies made to 
order is a hor-

cian s can

embryo's genes 
the potential for 
picking and

ous. 

The indi- 
vidualism of 
humans would 

dissipate and ,^— ^^^^— 
what is "in slyle" would dictate the 
personality, race, gender, intelli- 
gence and even the sexual prefer- 
ence of future children It would no 
longer be the combination of two 
people, but the pre-ordered genes 
from other humans 

Also, (he idea of using cloning 
for medical reasons is another aspect 
we don'i agree with 

For example, a person is 
extremely ill and ihis person needs 
bone marrow or a liver lo live Do 
we clone that person specifically for 
the liver or bone marrow? Do we 
then discard the clone? Is the clone 



thought of as human or jusl as med- 
ical pans? 

A person's clone will have emo- 
tions and will have feelings just as 
its original copy feels. So. we have a 
big problem with "breeding" clones 
for their parts. 

We believe this is another area 
where money talks. If someone has 
lots of money ibey could have all the 
flaws removed from their DNA and 
be replaced with ideal DNA from 
others. 

So, il would be a case where the 
rich would profit and gain an advan- 
tage over those that could not afford 
(o rc-asscmble their genes for their 
children. 

The most obvious reason for our 
distrust and dislike of human 
cloning is the fear of il falling into 
the wrong hands. Imagine if Hiiler 
had this technology! We would be in 
a world with thousands of little 
Hitlers running around. 

Think about Saddam getting his 
terrorisl hands on this. Nol a good 
thing. We have enough to worry 
about with just him.

Student gives cheers for the administration 



To the editor: 



I do noi read The 
Communicator on a regular basis, 
but when I do, all the letters to the 
editors are complaining about 
something. These people are either 
complaining about the location of 
the new parking garage, the recent 
bomb threats or some other issue 
that upsets them. Although, these 
two examples are frustrating. I am 
sure the administration is trying lo 
do something about them. I'm sure 
if the terrorist who called in the 
bomb threats respected the students 
of IPFW, he or she wouldn't have 
done it in Ihe first place 1 feel that 



Ihe administration is just as help- 
less as the students in these mailers 
and should not always take the 
brunt of the blow Being an IPFW 
student. 1 am just as frustrated 
about these incidents. I do, howev- 
er, feel thai ihe administration 
should receive some praise every 
once in a while. 

The adminisiraiion is 
doing many good things with 
IPFW. Although, the parking 
garage is an inconvenient place, 
they are making wonderful 
progress I remember al ihe begin- 
ning of the year I was talking lo a 
fnend about how it would probably 
take them well into the nexi school 



year to finish the garage. The other 
day I looked at the new garage, and 
il seems as if they will finish it 
before ihe year is out. 

I also think the teaching 
staff did a good job of handling Ihe 
bomb threats. Some of the teachers 
know they were helpless against 
the bomb threais and set up alter- 
nate places for class 10 be held. The 
administration even offered a 
S5.000 reward for information 
leading to Ibe arrest and conviction 
of the person calling in the bomb 
threais. 

The administration will 
also soon install a new computer 
lab in Classroom Medical building 
Being a student who spends most 



of his lime in this building, a 
change from the 20 year-old apple 
computers will be a welcomed 
change. 

Although. I do sympathize 
with the upset students. I believe 
lhat every once in a while they 
should sil back and think about all 
the good things and opportunities 
available al IPFW. 1 just want to 
lhank the administration for Ihe 
good things they are doing.

Internships profitable for students 



To the editor: 

I am a freshman at IPFW and 
have an engineering internship at 
Navistar- International, a truck engi- 
neering corporation. 

I pursued this internship on my 
own during my senior year of high 



school and was hired the following missing out on a valuable asset.

summer It has been an excellent 
learning experience. The money I 
make has made it possible to pay 
for college without taking out 
loans. 

Many students whose majors 
do not offer co-op experience are 



While many majors offer co-op ing money, 
experience. I think thai every major 
at IPFW should have some kind of 



co-op experience. 

I think that this would benefit 
the students by giving them the 
learning experience while earning

What happened to honesty? 



To the editor: 



What ever happened lo 
honesty? Did people ever really 
practice ii? Why is lying and cut- 
ling comers allowed to make prof- 
iLs for some at the cost of money 
and even lives of other people? 

Why do these harmful 
practices even cross some people's 
minds? 

Baby seats and loys are 
recalled for being unsafe. Vehicles 
are recalled for the same reason 



Planes are not maintained 
properly so people die unnecessari- 
ly. Food is improperly prepared 

Doctors charge outrageous 
prices for services few people can 
afford and even higher prices for 
those with insurance. 

People operate machinery 
and drive vehicles while under the 
influence of drugs and alcohol. 

Some people believe steal- 
ing and killing arc solutions lo (heir 
problems. Children and animals 
(domestic and wild) are abused and 
killed 

The list seems endless. 



Why? What happened to honest, 
quality work and quality parts, 
respecting all life and achieving the 
"American Dream" honestly' 1 

What happened to doing 
things jusl because it's the right 
thing to do and not because there is 
money lo be made? 

I believe things need to 
change. Do you? Where and how 
do we begin?

Iowa brood, Diana, Spice Girls lose big in 1997 



What's weak this week: Dennis Donahue 



Welcome back. While I was 
gone ihe Colts actually won Iwo 
games, the alleged bomb threat chic 
go! busied (Hunks U'FW police) and 
Purdue actually won a bowl, 
Someone check Hell for ice. 
Anyway, I hope that all is well with 
all of you, and that your vacation 
went okay 1 really don't know if I 
will be doing this much longer so 
I'll try and sum up 1997 in my way 
with the Top Ten Lamest Stories of 
the Year. I'll try and offend as much 
as I can You might want to buckle 
up. 

10) Spice Girls and Hanson. 
First of all, Spice Girls have no tal- 
ent, They don't write any music or 
pick out the really nasty clothes that 
they wear. They were created for 
Americans because we'll buy any- 
thing People in the pubs of London 
are still laughing at our attraction to 
(his "group" If you look at them, 
they arc really kind of ugly. Check 
next time, you'll notice. I've seen 
cuter hookers. If for some reason 
you own any SG's, I hope this is a 
phase. I will try to avoid you until 
this phase has passed. Next, we have 
the liitle kids from Oklahoma, 
Hanson Like the Osmonds, being 
cute sells. I heard they have a 
Christmas album. People who buy 
Hanson, buy Chia pels and bula 
hoops. They will disappear. I 
promise. MMMBop, is by the way, 
the worst song ever recorded, not 
counting anything ever done by 
Kenny G 

9) Rosie O'Donnell Just not 
that funny Give me a talk show and 
let me play with toys Who doesn't 
know the words to TV shows from 
the seventies? Her stand-up is pretty 
good, even her acting works, I loved 
her in "A League of Their Own ." 
But this suck-up has everybody in a 
buzz. She did not make "Tickle Me 
Elmo" popular. The media did, and 
we bought into it. And her fascina- 
tion with Tom Cruise? It's called 
stalking. Oprah still rules now that 
Uncle Phil has left. 

8) Hollywood, Movies and tele- 



vision are really getting insulting 
Sequels and remakes are just not 
good, never have been."Scrcam 2" 
is like a huge music video, and a ter- 
rible one at that. "Scream 3" fea- 
tures the cast of "Friends" getting 
murdered, one by one. That would 
be a good movie. The new "James 
Bond" flick reads like a 90-minuie 
commercial. Cell phones, cars, cam- 
eras and the like have been present- 
ed to us before it was in theaters. 
What exactly am I paying for when 
I see a movie anymore? Thai's right, 
outside sponsorship, no wonder I 
hardly ever go. "Tilanic" is great 
and you have to go see "Jackie 
Brown." one of the best soundtracks 
I ever heard. 

7) Pro sports. If I strangled my 
boss, I would be Tired too, but not 
just for a year How come million- 
aires don't get arrested? Ask OJ. 
this one. Making 5 million bucks a 
year is nothing these days I remem- 
ber when Reggie Jackson became 
the first baseball player 10 earn SI 
million. Pro sports have changed 
forever Ever wonder why beer is so 
expensive at a Komel game? Thank 
the NHL. And don't blame the play- 
ers, blame the owners. They arc the 
ones who make pro sports so expen- 
sive, because they can. They just 
pass the salaries onto us. So remem- 
ber to "boo" your favorite players 
loudly when they don't perform, 
they deserve it. 

6) Diana. Yes, this bummed me 
out loo I couldn't laugh about it for 
a couple of weeks until all the sick 
jokes came out Ask me, some arc 
funny. We lost the grcal Princess on 
my birthday this year. Then, after a 
while, the merchandise hit us. The 
stamps, dolls, plates and other col- 
lectors items came out. Making 
money off of someone's death isn't 
cool. If you bought any of this stuff, 
well, you suck. Rest in peace Di, we 
hardly knew ya\ 

5) Gun control. If family mem- 
bers of the leaders of the National 
Rifle Association were murdered 
with rifles would they change their 
views? Just a ihoughT. Ask the fam- 



ilies of people who have been killed 
by guns every year. What will it 
take? I realize this country has a 
Constitution, but the "right to bear 
arms" was written when muzzle 
loaders were popular. Amend this, 
get some guns off ihe street. In 
London last year. 13 people were 
killed by guns. In Fort Wayne last 
year, what was it? 34 or 35? Three 
this year already. 

4) Parking garage "Boo Hoo. I 
have to walk a long way to class." 
You guys are the biggest babies. Go 
to Bloomington and walk from 
Forest Quad to Morrison Hall. That 
is a long walk And don't say you 
would drive it because they have no 
parking in Bloomington. Quit com- 
plaining so much, you sound like 
me! Walking is good for you and 
some of you really need the exer- 
cise. Shut up, leave earlier and dress 
warm you big babies. 

3) Iowa septuplets Their first 
daughter will never be normal 
again. She'll be in therapy in a few 
years because of her seven sibs One 
kid not enough? Sometimes people 
have children for all the wrong rea- 
sons. Attention is one. Does anyone 
adopt anymore? 1 hope they realize 
that as beautiful as childbirth is, 
seven is a freak show. 

2) El Nino. Nuclear testing. 
that's my theory I love how we 
blame weather on something like 
the ocean Give me a break. I think 
there is some kind of underground 
ocean testing going on. China and 
the U.S. are leading up to some- 
thing Just another big coverup 
See. that's our problem, we still trust 
our government. Yeah. El Nino, is 
the reason for all the flooding and 
Lee Harvey acted alone

By Ben Ruble 

Staff Writer 



How many people reading ibis 
article have considered buying a 
new cellular phone to cany around? 
There are so many choices and so 
many questions lo ask about what 
the masi popular phones are and 
how much il costs to use a cellular 
phone. 

Wbai is the best phone? Well 
ibere realty isn't a ~~ 
best phone, bul as for 
the most expensive it is 
probably the Motorola 
StarTac 8600. at least 
for the GTE Mobilnet 
stores anyway. 

Is it tbe best? I 
can't 




mention 
some of its features. Some of the 
features include the world's fist 
continuously operating phone with 
dual detachable batteries; headset 
jack: rapid internal charger; 
VibraCall Alen: Analog Operation; 
Two-Line Display: VoiceNotc 
Answering Machine/Voice 
Recorder. 

What phones tend to be the 
most popular'' Tammy Merrills, 
who works at the GTE Mobilnet 
store at Glenbrook Commons, said 
she believes the two most popular 
phones are the Nokia 239 and the 
Motorola 650. 

The Nokia 239 is the replace- 
ment for the popular Nokia 232. 
Merrills thinks these two phones are 
also the best value for the quality 
when gelling a new cellular phone 
plan or upgrading your existing cel- 
lular phone I have Listed below 
some of the many features that both 
phones have. 

Tbe Nokia 239 has a built-in 
telephone directory that stores 98 
names and numbers. It has four 
programmable "One Touch" direct 
dial keys, plus it has Nokia's 
Supertwisl LCD screen ihat always 



displays all of the important infor- 
mation The 239 supports many 
types of batteries and charging 
methods which can total 2 1/2 hours 
of talk lime with 32 hours of stand- 
by lime. Finally, you can plug the 
239 into a laptop computer so ihat 
you can send and receive faxes, 
dala, and e-mail anywhere in a cel- 
lular network. 

The Motorola 650 has 
Motorola's famous easy-io-read 
displays The displays are big and 
simple to understand. The 650 also 
has a long talk and standby times 
The battery options slart with 90 
minutes of talk time and 24 hours of 
standby time. 

You can get even better batter- 
ies for your Motorola with longer 
performances. The Molorola also 
offers a wide range of chargers. For 
example, the mid- rale charger lakes 
less than 4 hours to charge. The 650 
offers multilingual display options 
loo. 

The choices include English, 
French, and Spanish Another nice 
feature of the 650 is the Calling 
Line ID with Message Waiting 
Indicator, though it isn't available in 
ail areas 

Basically, it is caller ID 
for a cellular phone This „,,,,. 
allows you lo choose 
which phone calls you 
want to answer. 
The Indicator 
can store up to 
20 numbers 

Also, the 
Indicator noti- 
fies you when a 



voice mad sys- 
tem which isn't 
available in all 
areas. 

But what are 
the rates for cellu- 
lar phone usage? I 
checked ihe GTE 
and Cenlennial 
Wireless websites 
and I found several 
pricing plans. 

GTE has one plan that 
charges 19 95/month and then 
charges you for every minute Ihat 
you use a cellular phone, i Ik- price 
on this plan varies from 
SO-45/minute lo S0.32/minu(e 
depending on how much you use 
your phone. The other GTE plan 
thai was listed charges major cellu- 
lar phone users S199.95/monlh with 
600 free minutes and a 




SO 30/nunule rale 

Centennial Wireless had four 
plans listed on website. Two were 
for major users, so I will not men- 
lion them. The PCS-30 plan offers 
30 free minutes to customers for 
S29.95/month and S0.49/minuie 
thereafter The PCS-60 offers 60 
free minutes to customers for 
$39.95/monlh and SO 48/minuie 
thereafter. 

So what are the best phones and 
phone services? That is probably 
just a matter of personal opinion. 
There are many other quality cellu- 
lar phone manufacturers including 
Ericsson and Sony. You should talk 
lo an authorized dealer before mak- 
ing a decision on what phone and 
service to purchase. Also look at 
some the following websites for 
more information:

By Nol Beckley 
Editor 

The eagerly anticipated sound- 
track to Dickens' classic "Great 
Expectations" was released on Jan. 
6. The soundtrack, on a first time 
listen, delivers the goods in spades. 
(Could I be any more cliche?) 

The CD opens with a surrealis- 
tic "instrumental vocalization" by 
Tori "I'm not a wiich" Amos fol- 
lowed immediately with her first 
new song since "Boys for Pele." 
dubbed "Siren." 

Like in Boys. Amos bnngs her 
harpsichord along and a semblance 
of a backup band. This gives ihe cut 
much more orchestration than most 
of her usual recordings and it works. 
(I should mention that I'm a dedi- 
cated "Tori-phtle," so my judgment 
may be a little suspect.) 

On to the rest of the CD. 

Chris Cornell, from ihe now 
defunct "Soundgarden." adds his 
two-cenis worth in a song, 
"Sunshower," that sounds similar to 
bis offerings on Uic "Singles" 
soundtrack Not meaning thai this is 
a bad song by any measure, but 
Cornell took us there before six or 
seven years ago. Does anyone want 
to go there again? I didn't mind 

Another frontman for a big-lime 
alternative/hard rock band. Scoil 
Weiland of "Stone Temple Pilots." 
adds his voice to Ihe composition. 
Strangely. Wciland's song. "Lady, 
your roof brings me down," sounds 
like a lost Beades track. Go figure. 




Poe's 



someone from 
STP sounding 
like someone 
other than Pearl 
Jam. You may 
have beard this 
one on the radio 

Poe put 
the most 1 
able new 
(oiber i 
Amos) 
"Today." 
lead singer has a 
Ibroaly. sexy 
delivery mixed 
with an almost 
school girl-like 
innocence. 

The Verve 
Pipe shows little 
range or inven- 
tiveness in "Her 
Ornament." Bul do they ever show 
anything inventive? Standard fare 
here and no one would blame you if 
you skipped to the next track which 
would be "Walk this Earth Alone" 
by Lauren Christy 

Christy gives a passionale per- 
formance, hut the chorus falls a lit- 
tle into sounding like Paula Cole 
Nol a bad artist to imitate But imi- 
tation is far from innovation. 

The CD closes strongly with 
two cuts that sound completely dif- 
ferent than the rest of the CD. The 
lasl track is "Bcsame Mucho" 
which reminds me of Antonio 
Bandares in "Desperado." 
Definitely a mariachi-like song by 



Cesaria Evora. I enjoyed this clever 
way of ending this CD Just before. 
The Grateful Dead's "Uncle John's 
Band" gives a much needed lift to 
this mostly depressing soundtrack. 

Other notables appearing on ihe 
CD are ihel977 track, "Success." 
from the Godfather of Punk, Iggy 
Pop. Pulp, Reef. Mono Duncan 
Sheik. Fisher and David Garza all 
contributed to the CD 

Overall this soundtrack was 
depressing in a Miss Havisham sort 
of way, but in Pip-like fashion, it 
bounced back at the end and almost 
put a smile onto my face. I'd give it 
a 7 on a scale of 1 to 10.

Dirty Laundry: Tony Laux 



By Tony Laux 
Sports Editor 

Ducking the "dumb jock" 
slereotype. 36 percent of IPFW's 
s i udent -athletes achieved grade 
point averages at or above a 3.0 
during the past semester 

Out of a total 142 student ath- 
leies, 18 made me Deans List grade 
point average of 3.5-4.0 and 34 
received Coaches Distinction hon- 
ors which is a 3.0-3 5 grade point 
average. 

Only 10 student athletes were 
found to have deficient grades 
while the cumulative GPA was a 
whopping 2.70 exceeding the 
NCAA Division 1) normal GPA. 

"In visiting with people associ- 
ated with IPFW Athletics over the 
years, it would appear that the 
1997-1998 year is probably the best 
year academically since the pro- 
gram began." said IPFW Athletic 
Director Butch Perchan. 

'"We have the fewesi number of 
academically dcficieni siudcnt-ath- 
Ictes and one of the highest num- 
bers of student-athletes earning 



academic achievement " 

Perchan seemed very exriled 
that the teams did so well in the 
classroom and felt a certain amount 
of pride. "Anytime you can have 
this many athletes make grades and 
gel honored you have to be happy." 

"Nexi year we hope to continue 
this trend and keep lowering the 
number of athletes that gel poor 
grades." 

Perchan also felt lhal me credit 
should go lo the coaches who 
worked hard with their learns lo 
keep on top of the grades 

Head baseball coach Tony 
Viltorio felt that the sludy tables he 
implemented helped his learn, 
"Everyone of my players must 
attend at least eight hours of study 
lables a week." 

Coach Viltorio didn't make 
excuses for the athletes that didn'l 
make grades. "Sometimes you 
have to take a chance on a player 
who is a liltle academically shaky 
oul of high school because you pan 
of your job as a coach is to help 
young people succeed in Iheir 
dreams " 



•The Indianapolis Colls have taken 
picked another has been to become 
head coach of the team. Jim Mora, 
who left ihe New Orleans Sainis 
after a profanity-laced news confer- 
ence after a loss lo the Carolina 
Panthers, feels great aboul this sec- 
ond chance to return to coaching. 
Mora has already started speculation 
thai be will select Peyton Manning 
with the first pick of the NFL Draft 
in April After lasl year's season of 
disappointment, I can't tell if this is 
good or bad news. 
•CBS has outbid NBC for the rights 
to broadcast AFC football games for 
a record 4 billion dollars over eight 
years Now that NBC no longer has 
football on its schedule we can look 
forward lo more of those awful 
infomercials in ihe afternoon, unless 
they can take over Monday night 
football from ABC which ihey are 
reportedly making a serious attempt 
lodo. 

•Here come the underclassmen to 
the draft At one time this was a rare 
occurrence but in reccnl years the 
number of players leaving is 
aslounding. Ryan Leaf and Charles 
Woodsen both can see that ihe 
money they will make in the 
National Football League will be a 
liltle better than the scholarship thai 



ihey are gelling. 

•Can anybody feel sorry for Peylon 
Manning? He gets bun ihe week 
before one of Ihe biggesl games of 
his life; he loses out on the Heisman 
Trophy to a predominately defensive 
player and then watches his team get 
trashed in Ihe Orange Bowl Next 
stop will probably be Indianapolis 
where he will gel trashed as a matter 
of routine. 

•Congratulations has to go oul lo ihe 
Purdue Boilermakers for their win ai 
the Alamo Bowl. They remained 
focused when ihey could have easily 
became distracted due lo their own 
success but coach Joe Tiller kepi a 
light reign on his team. Quarterback 
Billy Dickcn capped off an injury- 
plagued career with one of the best 
games of his life by selling a couple 
of Purdue and Alamo Bowl game 
records. 

*Wbai is wrong with the Big Ten in 
foolball? Every year ihey gel a huge 
amount of money to travel to bowl 
games and every year it seems like 
ihey gel their asses handed lo them. 
Iowa, Wisconsin and Penn State 
were embarrassed by their oppo- 
nents. Sure you could make a case 
for Penn State because of the loss of
