according loThc Indianapolis Slar. 

The Slat reponed Ibal lU

full iovesligalion of ihc incidcni oi 
(he leqoesl of ALhlelic Director 
Clarence Doninger. E&gt;(hi™ing spoke 
10 KnighL head haikctball trainer 
Tim Garl, assistant coaches and 
Reed individually. 'Neil told me, 
pom I blank, thai Bob Knight never 
choked him." said Etoiming. With 
the help of Donmgci conducting 
inlerviews with all parlies involved, 
they denied the accusations made by 
Reed and the lack of ipetific com- 
plaints led in the conclusion (hat the 
incident had imi taken place and. 
thus, ihe investigation was closed. 

YcL here »e are. dirce years 
later, rcbashuig the whole incldcnu 
The liming of Ihesc allegations com- 
ing to Ught again could be ques- 
tioned. Reed first brought these alle- 
gations to the altenljan of Indiana 
Univeniiy and the media itutx years 
ago Reed has not been heard from 
since thcn-lhal b. until now. What 
liming Reed has. loo One must giie 
bim a lound of applause Having

basketball loumament and three 
days before lU's first round gome

Pcpperdine by 20 points, was cicet-

thai the disiiaciions that came about 
from the resurfacing of Reed and his 
allegations did affecl lU and (he 
team's performance on Friday. Then 
again. III may just have played very 
poorly. 

Tbc reason given for (his story 
being re-released, as CNN/SI 
Managing Editor Sieve Robinson 
put iu was 'that the stoty is ninning 
now because it is finished, afier a 
year's worth of rcponing." What 
happened to (he incident two yean 
before this, when the stoiy was siiU 
fresh in the mind of many baskelball 
fans across the slate of Indiana and 
die rest of the United States? Why 
n-ere they no( conducting inierviews

(hey still seem to be at the same spot 
diey were at three years ago. Reed 
accusing Knight widi Knight and 
Indiana University denying the 
charges. Reed does have someone in 
his comer, though. 

Former IU p!a)-er Richard 
Mandeville has now made an 
appearance accusing Knigbt of wip- 
ing his butt in (rant of (he playcn to 
demonsmue how diey were playing. 
Cuntnt and lonnci players deny 
(bat Ibis happened the way 

According to former IU player 
Robbie Eggers in die Wednesday. 
Match 15 issue of Ihi. Journal 
GaTftic 'Coach may have walked 
in die locket room one day with a 
roll of loilei papcrand ai-led asif he

people question the tavoiitum thai 
IS given to Knight. IU professor of 
English and American studies and 
also a very ouLiawkcn critic of 
Knight. Murray Speibei, was quoied 
in The Indianapolis Star calling the 
Knight '(he emperor of Indiana.' 
Spciber believes (hat no one in 
Indiana 'will stand up lo him.' 

Does this mean dial Knigbt is 
allowed to get away widi any(hing 
because as some would consider.

(he famous chair Uitown across the 
coun in a game again; i Purdue in

199S This lelter was completely 
against Reed and his actions 
According lo a leport in tbc Fnday

ence where be was defending him- 
self. TWo days lalcf tbou^ a syndi-

released the lellei. Knigbt does bave 
the ngbt to defend himself, but what 
eucdy gives him and ibe oITtcUls 
the right lo release a letter that basi- 
cally bashes Reed? In a way, be is 
sinking (o die level of Reed, Reed 
smears Knight, so in turn. Knight 
smean Reed. Knigbl could possibly 



gain disrespect for releasing this let-

Knigbl needs to continue 
defending himself against Uiese alle-

gain much from rehashing the inci-

Ethical rights for people are above those of animals 

by Mislianrui Wood, Man.igirg Editor 




e week ago. dm nation celebrated 
S(. Palrick's Day. Every holiday comes wndi 
paraphernalia, promotions and celebrations 
Shamrocks adomcd many public placet which 
hosted local celebrations prior to Uie I8di at 

PETA, People for die EUiical Trcaonent of 
Animals, was one of die many organizations to 
promoic a traditional pan of die St. Palrick's Day 
celebration: drinking beer 1 assumed St. Patrick's 
Day because (he envelope sent (o Tbc

a mug filled wiU) green beer in his band. 

I was also convinced that the pto motion 
was linked to SL Pat's Etay because it was sent to 
us during die week of Oie holiday. The informa- 
tion was even accompanied widi a bold e opener. 

Many of you have beard and seen die "Goi

campaign with a different twist. Last week 
PETAseni out their 'tnH Beer?! Betier (han milk.

mdk IS had for me. I had ncvet been told to dnnk 
beer over milk undl I read die news release of 
PETA. TTiis campaign by PETA definitely proves 
(be old saying "don't believe evetyttiing you 
read!" The organisation made claims (bal milk 
can cause osieoporosis and (be pesticides and 
antibiotics (bat go fnxn (he cow to its milk can 
cause men (o grow breasts. 

Some of die nutritional reasons listed as to 
why mdk is bellei than beer arc Uiai beer has no 
(at or cholesicrol and milk docs and also that beer 
has fiber and tiuU: doesn't This information may 
be true, but I don't (huik It is presented fairly. 
There arc pros and cons lo everything we con- 
sume In my opinion, die cons dial come widi 
drinking a lot of beer outweigh ibox of drinking 
milk. PETA failed lo present (hose cons. My 
inlcrpretalion of dieir message is dus, "Drinking 
beer is okay because cows don't have to sulfct." 
"Knowing how cows suffer in the dairy 
indusiry is enough lo make anyone lactose intol- 
erant and with so many delicious healthful alter 
natives available, like Iresb juices soy milk and 
yes, beer, it's easy lo dump die dairy PETA 
President, Ingiid Newkitk was quoied in die 
release. According to (he release cows arc treat 
ed like milk machines because Uiey are always 
pregnant and diey rccene injuries from Ihe 
mochinei^ used by fatmeis 

I like animals and I try to help out nbcne\ 
er I can, bui when did cows suddenly become 
more important tbarl human lites'' As we all 
know, if one drinks a lot of alcohol on a rigular 
basis, he or she could become addicted I can 
attest 10 diis because I bave a relaiivc who is 
addicted. I would be pleased if my relative was 
addicted to milk instead of beer AlcohoUcs and 
dicir families suHeia lot more dian cows who are 
deprived of their mdkl!!! 



Many of you may be thinking to youtselvcs, 
"finally a [womoiion tor beer!!'" The procnonon 
torbeer isn'iihepoml. I thmk PETA is insulting 
all college students by insinuaung dial m-c ate 
that ignorant I am sure many of you out diere 
may enjoy beer, but do you really bcheve it has 
more benefits than milk? 

Perhaps I should ask if you wan( your kids 
or your younger broUier or sister to have beer 
served at school instead of mdk. I don't ibink so. 
Il appears lo me (hat PETA is sending (bis cam- 
paign to college snidcnts because die majority of 
us are single, childless and have no rcspoisibUi- 
lics. "(jetting college students to put milk prod- 
ucts out to pasture-by telling diem dial even beer 
is beiu;r for ihem-may noi laike much convincing, 
but PETA wants undergrads lo know diat (he

sizing certain notes with volume or 
widi wbai d&gt;ey call pauses — whcir 
Oicy stop playing." Thompson said 
of Ibc playing iccbuique. The other 
way is with embellisbment. or wbai 
sonK people call 'grace uoies' — 
wbere you produce a single note 
very briefly." In recent limes, 
Thompson said the pipes have 
"wanot as an ins_iimcni in Europe 

It was used all over Europe, 
especially in die Balkans and around 
die Mediterranean. As music moved 
indoors, ihe pipes lost their iiopor' 
tancc because Ibey don't make a 
good chamber instmment." 

"Tbe bagpipes tbemselves are 
quite old. Tbey were certainly used 



by tbe Greeks and dke Romans and 
were probably invented by the 
Egjpuans. although we don't know 
for sure. From Mesopotamia. Iheit's 
a picone of someone who some peo- 
ple interpret as playing the bagpipes. 
Oibei people say. 'no. no dial's not 
someone playing Ihe bagpipes, 
dial's a human sacrifice.' But we 
don't know for sure," 

Thompson said the mstiument 
was probably brought id England 
and Scotland when the Romans 
arrived. Many centuries later, in tbe 
lg'°century.ii was first used by the 
English miUiary. 

By die n bagpipe playing out- 
side of the military spectitun was 
outlawed and. as some historians 



say. was punishable by death, Tlie 
EhgUsb. boa'C%'er. began lo "attract 
Scots into their regiments by making 
tbe pipes a mllilaiy InslrumenL 
That's when you start getting march- 
es and dances." lliompson said. 

Before all of dils. an ancient 
style of bagpipe playing called 
nohaireacbd (roughly pronounced 
■plbtachi') reigned. Thompson 
described the Piobaireacbd as "very 
slow music. It's strange and hypDol- 
ic and it's very long. It is considered 
by pipers lo be die pinnacle of pip- 
ing. atUiougb most pipers don't I die 
it and don't play iL 1 love ii myself. ' 

As pan of his [nsenlaiion. be 
played the Piobaireacbd called 
"MacDonald of Kinlochotoidan's 



Lament No. I." He said tbe basic 
structure of this song and many tike 
it is buUI on die pentalonic scale, 
which is Ihe scale prcvalcDi in many 
popular styles of music. The song 
has a main Uxme and then a long 
slow theme dial buUds ihiougboul 
its middle. 

Describing the c^ipcriencc of 
hearing Thompson play, Alan 
Sindstrom. an IPBV associate pro- 
fessor ol anthropology, said "1 
dioughl it was edicreal and kind of 
had a leligious tone u&gt; iL II pul you 
in a slate of odieiworldliness."

VUiiing Minority Scholars Project. 
is Director of Africana Studies and 
an associflie profeisot of commoni- 
calion al Ihe University of Souib 
Florida She has laugbt cla.&lt;.ses and 
given numerous lectures on race and 
a involved and wcll-connccied in 
the debate al bcib Ibe local and 
national leveli. 

Her presentation, en I i tied 
"Blackness. Whlleoess and 



Contemporary Racism" ceolered on 
American racism and tried explain- 
ing ii from a sdentiric, hEsiorical 
and contemporary context. 

"Many people today compleiC' 
ly reject race as a scicnuric con- 
cept.' she said. 'Anihropologisis 
reject it. many geneticists reject IL 
Tbey say race is not scientilic. The 
way wx tend to Ifaink about people 
as while, black, jellow^ — these were 
categories (bai were crealed bcfon: 
ne had modem science. Many 
gene deists say there are tnany other 
n'ays to group people in addition lo 
these superTicia] qualities. ' James 
suggcsl^, grouping by blood type. 

Fcaiures of ibe human face and 
skin arc 'simple human adaptation 
to gcogtapby and physical climaie," 
she said. Tliey are just a small por- 
tion of a perwn'i entire genetic 
makeup. The two people most simi- 
lar In genetic niakeup might be 



Junes and a white woman sitting in 
the audieiKc in front of bcr. 

Sbc added that on opposite 
ends of Ihe genetic ipccinmi arc 
Africans and Abongines. tbe indige- 
nous people of Australia. 

Tbcre Is no such thing as a 
pure race.' she said. Gencdc studies 
have found thai 'Europeans were 
csseniially a hybrid race — 65 per- 
cent Asian, 35 perccni African. You 
know Hitler probably turned over in 
his grave.* 

James described race as "a 
social invention." The lerm "Mhiic" 
was coined in the iaie ITih century 
when Ihe colonial slave trade began. 
It was used to disiinguisb between 
free men and those permanently 
enslaved. "We could look ai Ibe 
word 'nigger' as essentially being a 
self-rclleciive term of whilcoess. 
You take everything negative about 
yourself— SI up idily, sexuality, lazi- 



ness—those things of while culture 
that whites found repulsive — and 
project it on the black man,' sbc said 
of the etymologies of these terms. 

Combine this with what she 
called the 'com pi icily of the 
cburcb." which, she explained, 
essentially connected Satan with 
darkness, ultimately resulting in ihe 
"demonizing" of blacks and slaves 
ihrougtloulmuchofU.S bislory. 



In 



the i! 






contemporary level, J: 
cussed "racial ambiguity.' or receni 
trends in wbai children of Interradal 
Qianiages consider themselves. She 
said many children who have one 
while patent and the olber of a dif- 
ferent race often consider Ihcm- 

On other lopics. sbe said Ibat 
nearly 80 percent of people in their 
late teens lo early twenties have at 
least one friend who is of a different 



than they are. Hie numbers of 
America have been 
glowing and will continue to do so. 
"By 20S6,' she said. 'America 
would become a minority majority 

She used Iht shon film True 
Colors" to look ai some aspects of 
Ihe issue al tbe local level. TDis mm 
followed two male students, one 
while, one black, conducting a lesi 
of racial relations in Fort Wayne. It 
showed them asking for a dollar 
busfare from strangers — saying 
they'd locked their keys in theu car 
and needed lo get lo school. Later, it 
show-ed each on the side of a higb- 
way with car difficulties and warn- 
ing lights llashlng. 

In both oics, fewer people 
passed by before someone slopped 
or helped the while student and 
more passed the black siudenl 
before helping ouL

dents applying for jobs at several

turned down ai each place tbey 
applied. The while student com- 
menied that ibe employcn seemed 
more sony not lo have a job avail- 
able. Tbe black student said he did 
not experience this.

She was afraid of while men and

Now, however, ber alliludcs 
arc different.

Cultural Spotlight 



Fort Wayne a whole new community for Iraqi refugee 



by Kerrin Langford, 
Slaff Writer 



Al the head of the Persian Gulf, 
in soulhwesiem Asia is an Arab 
country known as Iraq Haider Al- 
jayasby is a poUtical refugee from 
Iraq and came to Fort Wayne in 
1996. He suffered iwo bullet 
wounds during the Gulf War in 
1991. '1 was in a refugee camp for 
five years." said Al-jayashy. Al- 
jayashy has not lecnhis bmily since 
March 1991. This is Al-jayashy's 
rust year in college and be wants to 
major in either criminal jusiice or 
something that allaw.&lt;i him to coacb. 
He enjoys volleyball and soccer. 

Al-jayaihy is happy lo be in a 
counlry wbeie diere is freedom, but 
says there are many cultural differ- 
ences that make bun miss his family 
and alter his traditions. For 
ins lance, during such holidays as 
Ramadan, which begins at a dllter- 



: position of 
uc moon eacb year, he misses his 
family most. Ramadan started Dec. 
6, 1999 and lasied unul Jan. T, 2000 
This monih long religious ceremony 
involves fasting. Next year, based 
on the position of Ibc moon. 
Ramadan will be celebraied in 
November. Although this holiday is 
usually celebrated with family 
ttuDughoul tbe week. Al-jayasby 
only cttebraied on tbe weekends. 
To provide some sense of family, Al- 
jayasby said. *I celebrau: on Ibc 
weekends because there are people 
here in Fort Wayne from other 
Muslim countries thai celebrate this 
as well." 

Al-jayashy also noticed that 
strangers are treated differently here 
than in bis country, "In my counlry. 
foreigners or people there on 
business, are irealcd well," said 
Al-jayashy, 

Moreover, when he first 
moved bere. he found il hard lo 
understand our relatloBshlp or lack 



thereof, wiih food. According lo 
Al-Jaj-asby, '1 remember thinking 
how shocking it was lo see people 
pbying wiih their food and throwing 
i I away. In our counlry and others, 
people are starving!' Three meals, 
revolving around a family, are 
cooked eacb day in Al-jayashy's 
country. To accommodaie his desire 
tor family and home-cooked meals, 
Al-jayashy visits friends lo eat. in 
oriler lo avoid the processed or 
"quick" foods he still has not tned 
'Everything is homemade in my 
counlry and here i1 is mostly 
processed.' said Al-jayashy. 

ed diffetendy here." said Al'jayasby 
Teachers are seen as a second parent 
in his country. "In my counlry, you 
may nol leave (class), unless you 
raise your band to be excused, no 
mailer whal.' said Al-jayashy. 

Similarly, elderly are revered 
Tbe importance of elders canool be 
over- cstinmled in my country," said 
Al-jayasby. For example. Al- 
:tj=3 •'_■.■ ■ 



jsyasby said. "If my parents' parents 
say something, tbey have to listen 
and we will not allow our elders to 
go to a nursing bome,' A culture 
from which elders are looked up lo 
and lake care of the primary family's 
children, childcan; is us foreign lo 
Al-jayashy as homemade food is to 
processed foods. 

Since Al-jayashy's culture is so 
different, he is unsure of bow to 
approach Ihe American dating game, 
'In our country, if I unni to gel mar- 
ried, sometimes the parcnis will 
look tor a wife for Ihe son." said Al- 
jayashy He did explain that be is 
allowed lo dale Ihe girl be decides lo 
mairy. but Ihe dating process is dif- 
ferent. 'Kissing is a sin before mar- 
riage, and a woman must be a virgin 
before ii can even be considered." 
said Al-jayasby. 

TTic soon-ID-be wife and bus- 
band can refuse lo marry each other. 
However, the family pbys a btige 
role in the selection process, 'In my 



^ Ibe b 






woman would make a good wife is 
to look at her relalionsbip wiib bcr 
father.' said Al-ja&gt;'ashy, A woman's 
family is weighed heavily in the 
decision of whether or not Ihe mar- 
riage should take place. 

It makes sense that people fran 
Iraq would concern themselves wi lb 
family status and even neighbors 
lend lo bond as family. 'In Iraq, we 
know all our neighbois. This is how 
I build my reputation. Neighbors 
share food, help eacb other out and 
can walk into each other's houses 
unannounced.' said Al-jayasby, A 
sense of community in Iraqi terms 
would perhaps be construed as a 
lack of privacy in American icims, 

Strin standards are upheld in 
Iraq before marriage. Nol only arc 
strict standards placed on ibis union, 
but also on ihc meaning of death. 
However, similar lo a Chnstian- 
hased faiih, Al-jayiwhy said, "We 
believe m one god. through the Holy 
Spirii," During deaib, Al-jayasby 
said. 'An angel on Ihe right IcUs 



God the good things one has done In 
dieir hfc and an angel on the left 
transcribes Ihe bad.' Allbough in Al- 
jayashy's country. God is considered 
merciful, he said. The balance is 
made between the iwo and depend- 
ing on Ihe ralio. one will cllbec go to 

Like a true or false lest, in his 
culture, there is no cboicc bietwecn 
either Ion. In a cullute where three 
meals are cooked each day and fam- 
ily centers on it. Al-jayasby has 
adjusted lo the many shades of gray 
in America. However, the tests are 
not over yei. In order lo become an 
American citizen, Al-jayashy said 
Uialhe will have to wail another five 

including topics such as American 
bislory and geography. To remem- 
ber ID honor bis past, perhaps, 
through coaching a community 
sport, be may succeed at bridging 
the gap. building respect and 
ledcflning die neigbborfaood feeling 
be .once grew up in.
