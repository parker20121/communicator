IPFW mourns loss of two during holiday break 



Volleyball assistant killed in fall while

death, his mother believes. 

"I don't think Tony realized what an 
impact he had on everybody's life," Judy K. 

Laux, 32, was killed Tuesday, Jan. 6, while 
with the IPFW volleyball team in Puerto 
Rico. The team was spending a day at a 
beach in Vega Alta, Puerto Rico. Laux, who 
was a volunteer equipment assistant, died 
when he fell from an approximately 25-foot 
cliff near the beach. According to reports, he 
apparently landed in the swift currents of the 
Atlantic Ocean. 

Men's volleyball coach Arnie Bali said 
Laux had gone to see another view of the 



was no longer visible when -.he turned back 
around. Nobody witnessed Laux fall into the 
ocean, Ball said. How that happened would 
be speculation, he noted. 

Members of the squad pulled him from 
the water and 911 was called immediately 
Team trainer Scott Knerr attempted to per- 
form cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Puerto 
Kico officials haw told the family a cause of 
death will be made official next week when 
that portion of the investigation is conclud- 




cern for others will be missed. Ball said. 

"Tony is what IPFW is missing. In the 22 
years I've been here, nobody loved IPFW 



s very positive, v erv earing," he said. 
The 1998 IPFW graduate was buried 
Tuesday wearing a university sweatshirt in 
his hometown ol Columbia City, about 20 
miles west of Fort Wayne. 

While going to undergraduate school, Laux 
was active in a variety of school activities. 
He was a member of the cross country team, 
a senator for IPGSA, a columnist and sports 
editor for The Communicator and a member 
of Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity.

"He had a lot ol adventures in his life.

Anthropology Department Director Alan 
Sand stmm said. 

Provost, 58, passed away in Fort 
Wayne Dec 24 due to complications Norn

ed in Ipswich, Massachusetts last week. 

Provost was the first lull tune anthropol- 
ogist to work at IPFW. His tenure at the 
school began in 1972 and he began the 
anthropology program here. 

Sandstrom, who had known Provost 
since undergraduate school 36 years ago, 
noted his many accomplishments. Provost 
was one of the first Fulbright award win- 
ners at the university and helped anthropol-

those professors that most people never get

Kat Kuhne said kuhnc is a senior studying 
Anthropology "He reveled in forcing peo-

Principal Richard Fielding from 1987 




Haskins, who will appear through the 
Joey Edmonds Agency, was spotted by 
members of SAB during the National 
Association of Campus Activities regional 
convention in Peoria, Illinois. Alter seeing 
Haskins perform, SAB advisor Audrey 
Moore immedially began speaking with 
the agency on booking Haskins. 

'We are excited to have him, every- 
one knows who Mr. Belding is," said 
Moore. "It is a great way to kick off our 
spring semester." 

Haskins, who will be in the theatrical 
releases "Wild Michigan" and "Reverie" 
this summer has been busy in the enter- 
tainment industry since "Saved by the 
Bell" (the "New Class" version) was can-

Haskins worked as a music manager,

In 1987, the big break came for 
Haskins, who landed the role of Belding 
on the new show "Good Morning Miss 
Bliss," starring Haley Mills. 

Thesuccess that "&lt; .nod Morning Miss

IPFW offers chance to study abroad in Istanbul

rip to Istanbul, presented by 



through 23. 

However, the tour, led by Professor 
Michael L. Spath, can also be taken with- 
out the class. 

"It's my favorite city in the world," 
commented Professor Spath, a PhD in 
Islamic Studies. 

Istanbul, located in Turkey, is the 

ids between East and West" and 

'rich political cultural and 

tory," according to Prof. Spath. Also, 

'all three of the great Western religions 

ire present there today," he further elabo- 



"It's a good introduction to the 
world of the middle east, These people 
are at home both in Europe and the 
Middle East," Prof Spath said. 

The structure of the visit will include 
both guided and self-lead tours. After the 
first two days of touring, the visitors have 



the option to choose from several other 
optional tours. 

For those who enroll in the class, 
examples of on-site class work include 
touring, reading and keeping a photo 
journal. The photo journal, according to 
Prof. Spath, "is one of the more exciting 
and fun aspects of the assignments," he 
said. 

One of the featured events of the trip 
is an evening with the Whirling 
Dervishes, a Sufi Muslim order known 
for their spinning dances. The visitors 
will be able to view the members of the 
order at prayer and observe their dances, 
called Sema, which last 20 minutes at a 
time. "During my number of trips to 
Istanbul, I've developed a friendship with 
the Whirling Dervishes," commented 
Prof. Spath. The Whirling Dervishes have 
been a point of study for Prof. Spath, 

"People want some structure, and 
they want to feel comfortable in their sur- 
roundings. On the other hand, they don't 
want to have tours 24/7," commented 
Prof. Spath. "People like to go at their 

speed, and enjoy some leisure time," 



elers will stay is, "where tourists dwell," 
according to Spath. "There is enough of 
the old feel, that its rather pristine, but 
touristy enough that there are regular 
police and tourist police," he said. 

The question of security, a concern 
for all world travelers today, "is an issue," 
according to Susan Byers, director of Off 
Campus Credit and Distance Learning at 
IPFW. 

"All these faculty members who are 
leading these trips feel completely safe," 
she further commented. "They keep track 
of where people are, and nobody is soinj^ 
to be disappearing," she said. 

While on the trip, "We check in with 
each other on a fairly regular basis," said 
Prof. Spath. 

The cost of the trip varies depending 
on the number of person? involved and 
may range from $1893 to S2093. 

"I think that foreign travel is a posi- 
tive experience for any university stu- 
dent. ... No matter what your major," 
commented Prof. Spath, "more and more 
we are citizens of the world."

s well," Bridegam said. 

One of the program's former stu- 
Doug Kline, will be teaching 
it's spring semester class. 

Kline is an IPFW graduate who 
went on to receive his Ph.D. at Edinburgh 
University in Scotland. It is because of 
the work of Provost and the 
Anthropology Department that 
Sandstrom believes IPFW is becoming 
known for its undergraduate program. 

"We've had students get master's 
degrees at Cambridge (University), 
University of Chicago. All the best uni- 
versities in the world," Sandstrom said. 

Provost and Sandstrom became 
interested in anthropology while in 
undergraduate school together. He 
described it as "extreme journalism" - 
going out to report on cultures - not just 
for a few weeks, but months or years on 
end. When he wasn't teaching, he was 
learning. Officials with the Anthropology 
Department pride themselves as working 
educators - taking time to conduct field- 
work when not teaching courses, 
Sandstrom said. 



Provost had spent time conducting 
fieldwork all over the world, including 
the Peruvian Amazon in South America, 
Tibets in exile in Asia and with the 
Australian Aborigines. 

With Sandstrom and Sandstrom's 
wife, Provost met the Dalai Lama while 
in India during the early 1980s. 

Provost had battled Parkinson's 
Disease. Bridegam said she saw the dif- 
ference the ailment made through the 
two decades she knew him. 

"One of the more poignant moments 
1 had with Paul in the Fall of 2000 was 
when he said to me that although 1 was 
having to start back to school with a cast 
on my leg, at least I knew my injuries 
would heal and get better. He then low- 
ered his eyes and said 'As for me, I will 
never get any better.' I knew he was refer- 
ring to his Parkinson's," Bridegam said. 

But Parkinson's had nothing to do 
with his death, Sandstrom noted. The 
condition that killed him could happen 
to anyone, his friend said. 

Provost thought he was battling the 
flu during finals week. On Tuesday, he 
experienced a pain in his lower chest and 
went to the hospital. He was admitted to 



the hospital Tuesday night. About 24 
hours later, he lost the ability to breathe 
and consciousness. He remained on life 
support systems until Christmas Eve. 

"It was rapid. He went from

Wednesday night in a coma and he 



Sandstrom said. And his legacy will _ _ 
how he taught, along with how he lived - 
- by always encouraging people to recon- 
sider their thoughts. 

"He definitely had a different way of 
looking at the world than most people, 
but whether you agreed with him or not, 
you couldn't help but be fascinated by 
what he had to say. I don't think I sat 
through a single class or had 



and understood," Kuhne said. 

Sandstrom agreed. 

"He made the university real for stu- 
dents. He was very talented, a really 
good person to have on your side and 
full of energy ~ even at the end."

IPFW athletic director Mark 
Pope knew Laux through his 
work for the department and 
said Laux's attitude about life 
is one more people should try 
to embody.

IPFW has started The Tony 
Laux Memorial Scholarship 
Fund, Pope said. 

According to the announce- 

;nt, "Tony Laux recognized 
the importance of higher edu- 

,on, earning his Bachelor's 



Master's Degree. He also had a 
passion for the athletic 
endeavors of the Student- 
Athletes that represent IPFW 
on the fields and courts. As a 
testament to Tony's devotion 
to academies and athletics, we 
are proud to establish a memo- 
rial scholarship fund in his 
memory. Scholarship recipi- 
ents will know that the bene- 
fits they receive are a result of 
the most important values that 
Tony held." 



During the Friday, Jan. 16 vol- 
leyball game, there will be a 
remembrance for Laux, Pope 

Those interested in con- 
tributed to the fund can do so 
by contacting the IPFW 
Athletic Department at Gates

"He would do anything for 
anyone," Coyle said. 

At a time of tragedy, people 
often try to come to some 
understanding on the situa- 
tion. For Ball, it is still too early 
to understand what Laux's 
loss will teach the community. 

"There's always a lesson to 
be learned. Sometimes you' 



For the past three seasons, 
Laux had been doing laundry 
and maintaining equipment 
for the men's volleyball team. 
He never complained about it, 
his mother said. He enjoyed 
being involved. 

"He loved working at the 
gym and working with the 
athletfs." she said, 

Laux was the first manager 
for the IPFW volleyball team 
in Ball's 22 years here. But the 
family received words of con- 
dolences from all parts of the 



campus. 

"When you have s

institution is made up of lots

Lessons in life and in death 

Neither man sought spotlight, bul in their deaths, we reflect on the impacts they had on our com- 
munity. 

Anthropology professor Dr. Paul Provost, 58, died Dec. 24 in Fort Wayne due to complications 
from pneumonia. Volleyball equipment assistant Tony Laux, 32, died in Puerto Rico after an acci- 
dent at a beach there. 

Provost was known for his sly wit and descriptive stories. His ability to intoxicate students with 
knowledge not only brought more people into his discipline, but gave those who only took his 
class for course credit an understanding why anthropology Is not only interesting, but necessary. 

I .up. w.is known im hi-. hus\ lil&lt;--l\ Irjiid positive outlook, lo paraphrase Ms mother, when he 
was done with one project, he was beginning another. He loved being involved with fPFW - most 
recently as an equipment manager - but his activities while in school were numerous. 

Provost was described by a friend as living life to its fullest, Laux was doing the same thing as he 
continued taking classes after graduating from IPFW in 1998, Both enjoyed a variety of experiences, 
from travels around the world lo running for a university cross country team. 

They never sought the spotlight. They wanted to help others by teaching or assisting. They 
worked to better those around them. As a sports editor for The Communicator, Laux passed on his 
knowledge to others. Asa faculty advisor to the Anthropology Student Association, Provost assist- 
ed in teaching those interested in his field. 

Both wea 1 far too young to die. That is a reminder to all of us mat a momentary slip or quick ill- 
ness can end our last day without a chance for us to say goodbye to loved ones. 

We leam from their deaths that life can tragically be ended too soon. We leam from their lives that

Mark Souder's 'Great Adventure' 

US. Rep. Mark Souder patted ivserve soldiers on their heads last week as they gear up for duty 
in Iraq by welcoming them to a "great adventure." 

According to press reports, the congressman spoke to over 200 members of the 221 Ordnance 
Ammunition Group about their deployment scheduled to begin in February; and used the phrase 
"great adventure" in describing the current war in Iraq and the other war on terrorism. 

It's a good bet no soldier has ever returned from a war thinking it was a "great adventure." Wars 
can be necessary evils or the end of necktie diplomacy, but for those dealing with bullets and blood, 
war is not a "great adventure." 

Of course, Souder wouldn't know this himself. He missed his opportunity for a "great adventure" 
during Vietnam by avoiding service and attending IPFW. He has been described by some as a 
"chickenhawk" - one of numerous conservatives who pride themselves on supporting any military 
deployment that lasts six months or a year, but never served a da)' of boot camp. 

Souder's greatest contribution during the Vietnam era was (and this is verbatim from his congres- 
sional website: "Had he not been elected to Congit'ss, perhaps his most significant achievement 
would have been his involvement in naming the IPFW 'Mastadons' while he was student body 
president." 

And it's ,i good bet he wasn't worried about bullets flying or blood spilling when he exercised his 
braincells to come up with such a "significant achievement." 

Souder makes it a routine to embarrass himself with odd statements and pointless legislation. But 
he also prides himself with his support for the troops - wrapping himself in a flag for votes. He 
has visited the world because of the war on terrorism. But his has been necktie travel with congres- 
sional security. 

Maybe that's what he thinks their "great adventure" is when troops go to war. 



Word of the week: 
Antilocution 



For the past few years, f have noticed a trend in slang among my 
peers that I find disturbing. Despite our years of exposure to a world 
that strives to be politically correct, this particular and offensive say- 
ing persists. It is common among children, young adults, and some 
of the older generation. Most often it is used to describe something 
one finds negative or unpleasant: the phrase is, "That is so gay." 

When I hear this, I instantly think, "Really? Tell me, which part of 
that is outstanding homosexual?" I've heard this phrase applied to 
just about everything, from an unusually mean supervisor at work to 
high gas prices. It simply does not make sense, except when looked 
at from the view that in using 'gay' to describe a negative object or 
situation is an attempt, whether purposeful or not, to further encour- 
age homophobia and homosexual stereotypes. Alter all, if the phrase 
were, "That is so black," when referring to a negative event, it would 
be abundantly clear that the speaker was biased against African 
Americans. Essentially, the use of this phrase is really saying 
'gay=bad'. 

To make this perfectly clear: not everyone who uses "gay" as a neg- 
ative adjective is automatically homophobic. There are probably 
homosexual people who unthinkingly use the phrase as well. The 
majority of the people who currently use such slang are probably 
doing so because it has become popular among the younger genera- 
tions, and do not think as to what its usage implies. However, for 
those of us who have taken Social Psychology, this 'trend' is instant- 
ly recognizable as antilocution, the generalization o'f terms or jokes 
through a population that single out a certain group and, while 
seemingly harmless or amusing, are actuailv quite detrimental. 

Then there are those who most certainly know what they are say- 
ing and choose to say it because of their beliefs about the morality or 
nature of'homoseVUa'Hty. In this case, the intent to defame is both 
purposeful and malicious. You do not need to take a class to recog- 
nize that as outright homophobia It is ultimately these people who 
reinforce the use of 'gay' as a negative adjective and the idea that 
homosexuality is inherently bad. 

Of course, there is no clause in the Constitution that can force any- 
one to agree or disagree with homosexuality. In fact, it is your right 
to think and say whatever you please. It does little good to appeal to 
your sense of the law: rather, it is most effective to appeal to your 
sense of equality. You may disagree with someone's religion, politi- 
cal affiliation, or sexual preferences, but if those differences are not 
harming anyone, you must respect them as a person - which 
includes refraining from using slang that encourages negative

Don't forget your Toast and Jam 



It is a mark of distinction that a business named after a 
sandwich could turn out to be the best coffee shop in Fort 

The house that houses Toast and Jam is as oddly painted as 
its name~a mix of pink and teal hues adom the intricate 
Victorian architecture. The three-story house, with towering 
spires and a wrap around porch, seems out of place against 
the plain gray buildings that comprise the modem skyline of 
Fort Wayne. The unusual outer colors of the house belie the 
elegant interior, a mix of classical deep browns and reds; the 
intricate dark woodwork and marble fireplace speaks of an 
original owner who spared no expense. 

Dimly lit and with an distinctive blend of coffee and ciga- 
rette smoke in the air, live music was always the main event 
in the evenings, and this captivating element seemed to 
make the normally noxious smells of smoke and coffee 
something familiar. The small, warm space sometimes made 
seating a problem on crowded nights; on other 
was if you had a personal concert, listening to t 
in front of an empty room. 

I sat in Toast and Jam on more than one occasion, amazed, 
as a dwindling crowd did nothing to discourage the featured 
musician. The music continued far past any economic bene- 
fit, fame or otherwise. The tip jar, filled with mostly one-dol- 
lar bills, seemed woefully small in comparison to the quality 
of the music. There was no way the small amount of change 
would ever cover a regular gig. 

The musicians were there to play, and so Toast and Jam 
stood in the same spirit, never making a sizeable profit in its 
existence. It's hard to understand why a business would stay 
open despite a lack of economic benefit. In a fiscal sense, the 
proprietor was going abnul the business of coffee all wrong; 
the warm, smoky atmosphere ot Toast and Jam is miles away 
from the artificially clean, bright fluorescent of places such as 
Starbucks and the ilk—the Wal-Mart clones of the coffee 
industry. 

With plenty of room for all, these cookie-cutter coffee com- 
panies provide a few books, a box of checkers and a mono- 
grammed T-shirt and they serve their brand name confec- 
tions with as little human interaction as possible. After all, 
there are more customers to serve behind you. The con- 
sumers who attend these coffee shops almost seem cookie 
cutter as well, though the partem varies from place to place: 
the pedestrian shoppers at Jefferson Pointe, the well-dressed 
denizens of Ground Level and the high-school Goths trying 
to prove their independence at Firefly are just a few of the 
coffee house dress codes in Fort Wayne. Despite the bohemi- 
an intentions of these establishments, the pack rule still 



seems to apply in regard to 
personal appearance and 
sometimes, even attitude. 
This formula also found 
itself reversed in the old 
Victorian home; hippies who 
never gave up the dream 
were right at home with the 
neo-conserva lives who took 
time to indulge in their radi- 
cal past by visiting the coffee 
house. Young and old, mid- 
dle class or well to do, chose 
any pair of cliched opposites 
you like, it really didn't mat- 
ter. What brought everyone 
out to the house on Wayne 
Street was the music, and 
this common interest 
superceded the petty differ- 
ences of modem man, if only 
for an hour or two. 

On crowded nights, I saw 
the sharing of table space on 
many occasions. Once again, 
in contrast at your local con- 
glomerate coffee shop, this 
might be dangerous. But 
even in downtown of Fort 
Wayne, it didn't seem to be a 
problem inside the walls of 
Toast and Jam. 

Outside, the world 
remained as it always did. 
The spell was broken the 

moment one walked down the porch steps. But the dark 
night in which you left Toast and (am seemed often seemed 
a bit brighter for your time. 

And like all impossible occurrences, so Toast and Jam 
fell into inevitability leaving with 2(i03 ,,t'tcr years of no prof- 
it. Even the most high-minded of ideals eventually succumbs 
to reality, and all that remains of the musical venue is a 
future of house concerts. What once was, will not be again. 

Perhaps the question is not how to write about the closing 
of a coffee shop, but why. 2004 promises to be a year of frag- 
mentation, politicians pulling the people of America into 
their respective camps, calling lor a unilv under the direction

once more. As this year begins, we witness as yet another 
anachronism passes from our midst in the form of a beatnik 
coffee shop. In the end, il is not the coffee shop that is worth 
remembering, but the people, and the music. We now have 
one less refuge from the reality of existence, one less chance 
for fellowship. 

I do not possess a great enough command of the language 
to truly define the essence of Toast and Jam, and in all hon- 
esty, there is a distinct possibility that there isn't a greater les- 
son that can be learned from the whole experience. But I 
can't help but think that maybe, as we move on into the new 
year, the people of Toast and Jam, customer and performer 
alike, remind us tliat we can find something different from

To watch or not to watch, the 
channels are the question 



Whenever there are extended 
periods of time away from a 
jam-packed semester, I, like 
many of my fellow classmates, 
am often forced to find other 
ways to fill my life. 

Some of us choose to work, 

hours just to help pad our wal- 
lets and our bank accounts for 
the meager schedules we can 
pull off during the semester. 

Some of us, whose wallets are 
already padded enough, take 
the time to travel. Spending 



the "world's 'coolest' spots" 
rounds out the time between 
semesters. 

There are those of us who 
have families, and with the 
younger children being out of 
school as well, time off from 
school means time off for the 

Then there are those of us that 
manage lo fill our lives with a 
variety of time-tillers Sleeping 
in, shopping, working, nap- 
ping, studying for the upcom- 
ing semester, partying, sleep- 
ing, hanging out with friends, 
and catching up on some much 
needed shuteye rounds out the 
lives of a majority of IPFW's 
student population. 

No matter which of these pro- 
files vou lit into, there is a com- 
mon thread woven amongst 
each. Without classes and seri- 
ous studying, there will exist 
time for an old friend. 
Television fills the extra time in 
between shifts, shopping, sun- 



bathing, sightseeing and sleep- 
ing. My break was no different. 

Although I managed to avoid 
the bitter weather here in the 
fort, being in sunny Georgia 
didn't keep me from being 
sucked into the boob tube, 
much like many others. I've 
seen a lot of my old favorites, 
resurrected on TV Land and late 
night reruns. If it weren't for 
these familiar faces, I'd have 
been confused. The TV of my 
youth is no more. This new tele- 
vision is nothing more than 
channel after channel after 
channel of specialized program- 
ming. There's even a channel to 
tell you all about the other chan- 
nels. Amazingly enough, I'd be 
willing to bet that that was the 
channel I flipped to the most. 

There used to be one channel 
for each general segment of the 
population. ESPN, 

Nickelodeon, ABC, NBC, MTV, 
CBS, PBS, VH1, Fox and Disney 
were some of the major players 
from my youth. Suddenly, 
there's practically a channel for 
every five people. I've come to 
the conclusion there are execu- 
tives that have nothing better to 
do with their time but walk up 
and down the streets, interview 
10 people for their top five 
interests and then create a sta- 
tion with the winners. HGTV, 
ESPN Classics, Food TV, Travel 
Channel, Fashion Network, 
Golf Channel, Discovery Kids, 
Cartoon Network and the 
Hunting Network are just some 
the presents delivered to me by 
my kind cable company. 

After polling the general pub- 
lic, if there is channel somewhat 
like it already in existence, 
there's not a problem. There's 



going to be a different angle to 
see it from, so there needs to be 
another channel. There are 
many stations that can be used 
to illustrate the wonder of the 
subdividing networks, but one 
good example comes to mind. 
As a child, I was glued to 
Nickelodeon. Great live action 
shows like "Salute Your Shorts" 
and "Hey Dude"; game shows 
like "Double Dare" and "Wild 
and Crazy Kids" have given 
way to a network of cartoon 
programs. In the time before it 
turns into Nick at Nile there are 
only two live action shows on 
the network. The only thing 
keeping them from continuing 
the cartoons to the Nick at Nile 
time slot is the fact that Nick at 
Nite shows programs from back 
when cartoons weren't their 
only gig. I feel the need to inter- 
ject one quick observation. 

Why are we forced to watch 
hours upon hours of "Full 
House" in syndicated reruns 
when great series such as 
"Salute Your Shorts," "Hey 
Dude," "You Can't Do That on 
Television" and "Welcome 




Freshmen" are 
forever in the 
abyss. Where .

Kate and Ashley Olsen (even

but we are left craving more of

the ever popular super sloppy 
double dare. 

These are not the only things 
the TV has taught me in my 
time off from school, but this is 
all I can handle thinking about 
right now. The rest is too upset- 
ting to handle today.

Interested in the story of Abraham Lincoln? Think you know so much about him that you 
could lecture on it? Then sign up for the 2004 Docent Training Course at the Lincoln Museum to 
have the opportunity to lead museum tours of the award winning exhibit "Abraham Lincoln and 
the American Experiment." Cost is $15.00 for materials. 

Upon completion of the course, graduating docents will be asked to volunteer a minimum of 
20 hours per year and will receive a complimentary family membership to the Lincoln Museum. 
For more information on how to make new acquaintances with individuals who have common 
interests while bringing the legacy of one of our greatest presidents to life, then call The Lincoln 
Museum at 455-3864. 



The deadline has been extended until Jan. 26 for those who want to join the Department of 
Theatre's five-day stint in New York City. Tickets have been secured to see "The Boy from Oz," 
the much-talked-about show starring Hugh Jackman. 

The trip will take place March 10 - 14 and costs $1,420 per person, which covers round trip 
jet airfare, shuttle bus service to and from the hotel, accommodations at the Edison Hotel. In addi- 
tion to "The Boy from Oz," students will have the opportunity to see "Wicked" and "Never Gonna 
Dance." Larry L. Life, chair and artistic director and Craig A. Humphrey, associate professor 
will accompany the students on the trip. For more information, contact Joanna in the Department 
of Theatre office at 481-6551. 



In March of 2004, the Department of Fine Arts will sponsor an exciting exhibit of Midwest 
ceramic artists for The National Council on Education for the Ceramic Arts {NCECA}. The exhibi- 
tion will feature nationally known artists working in the ceramics medium, from this region of the 
country. Before traveling to Indianapolis for the 38th Annual NCECA Conference, IPFW will pre- 
mier "A Sense of Identity: Contemporary Ceramic Art" at the IPFW Visual Arts Gallery from Jan. 
16 through Feb. 27, 2004. 

Organized and curated by Robert F. Schroeder, both sculptural and functional works will be 
included with 32 artists featured, and the exhibition checklist numbers 55 works of art. Schroeder, 
who has worked as an artist and curator in the Fort Wayne area for the past 14 years, knew the 
impact a gathering of such influential artists would make on our student body and the communi- 
ty in general.

Baby, it's cold outside 

After a not-so-white Christmas, Fort Wayne was hit 
with freezing rain and what felt like sub-zero tempera- 
tures. Due to the slick roads, driving conditions were 
hazardous. However, the freezing rain left a winter 
wonderland-like blanket of ice on everything from 
street signs to pine trees, as pictured above.

British import ABS brings radio friendly 
dance beats to first Amercian release 



Every new and then it's refreshing to find 
an artist with a hit single who reached that 
point through hard work, good lyrics and 
immense talent. Today, at least lor Europe, A bs 
Breen (now simplv known as Abs) is that artist. 

With "What U Got," his first single off of 
"Abstract Theory," already in heavy rotation on 
radio statu m&gt; in his native hngland and a quick 
selling Tup ? hit overseas, it's evident that Abs 



is now reaching ears far beyond his Hackey, 
East London home. And soon perhaps, he may 
reach the ears of those dance club fans in 
America. 

With his rich Euro dance beats and eclec- 
tic, yet unique voice leading the way, "Abstract 
Theory" proves to be a sometimes mellow, 
sometimes upbeat, sometimes poppy and often 
enjoyable album. Although Abs' lyrics are not 
extremely profound (with the exception of the 
album's top ballad "Rain"), they do tend to be 
honest and relevant. 



In the nostalgic 
"Rain," Abs expresses 
the purity and cleansing 
of a relationship gone 
wrong when he sings, 
"Is it my rum to cry over 
you? Because no matter 
what I do, those rainy

This track is by far 
the most profound and 
emotional on the alburn. 
It also puts every other 
ballad on the album, as 
well as most pop-bal- 
lads currently on the air- 
waves worldwide, to 

If the styling of 
Abs' former boy band 

quench, then you 
get even that in this album. While not the best 
of tracks in the world, "7 Ways,' the most recent 
released single from "Abstract Theory" is a 
leader in the ways of pure bred pop. 

Also, helping in the world of pop music 
on this album is "Back to the Limbo" and the 
leadoff track "Stop Sign." While both are equal- 
ly tame and upbeat in their own ways, neither 
really gives Abs the opportunity to utilize Ins 
true talent. 

Of the two however. Stop Sign," easily 
delves more into life with much more compre- 
hensive lyrics. In a lyrical field. Stop Sij;n is 
the top pop-like track on the disc. 

Whereas Abs' lyrics may not utterly capti- 
vate you, depending on your personal propen- 
sity, his range and ability is impeccable. 
Unfortunately "Abstract Theory" does his talent 
little justice, with the exception of a few select 



'holo provided b\i BMC Enli-rlaii 

of Abs' "Abstact Theory,"

One of those tracks, his first single "What 
U Got," is the best in terms of the dance beat, 
m'H defined "g.ir.ige music" that Abs is search- 
ing for. hilled with .1 lew pop culture references 
,ind a typical European rap mixed with some 
moderate chorus vocals, "What U Got" is the 
key song to get people up and dancing il it is

While some songs on the album mimic 
disposable boy band pop sungs (see 'Turn me 
Up" and "Roll with Me") Abs has proven him- 
self buz/ worthy i\ ith his masterful range, 

Though you may need more than buz/ to 
make and sell a great CD, Abs is well on his

With the Internet, a British 
surgeon can instantaneously talk 
with a Chinese doctor about how 
to properly close a chest after heart 
surgery (Elmer's Glue). At the 
exact same time, they can debate 
who was prettier - Wilma 
Flintstone or Betty Ruble. 

In my profession (okay, "pro- 
fession" is probably pushing it) we 
use the Internet and e-mail to com- 
municate all the time. I've even 
conducted e-mail interviews, ask- 
ing pertinent questions like: "What 
will you do if you're elected dicta- 
tor of Adantis?" and "Who do you 
think is prettier, Wilma or Betty?" 

But for all the Internet bene- 
fits, there are a few www.probtems 
that pull my mentality backwards. 

Forwards. 

Don't get me wrong, there are 
quality e-mail "forwards" - or as 
they're known in "subject" lines; 
"fwd:" - but highly-paid scientists 
will also say there are quality "spi- 
ders" and "cholesterol." 

I enjoy receiving e-mails — 
however, I'm starting to develop a 
tick whenever I see "fwd: cute 
jokes" or "fwd: funny jokes" or 
"fwd: inspirational saying" or "fwd: 
inspirational speech." 

Again, some of these are 



worth repeating, but others are as 
"cute," "funny" or "inspirational" as 
poison ivy. I'm wondering about 
the new psychology at work where 
a segment of society believe they 
must forward everything they see 
on the Internet. These includes 
texts which are as pointless as "For 
What It's Worth" columns along 
with highly-enhanced pictures.

you don't pass this on, you're true 
love will marry your pet llama. 
With forwards, you get: 
"Fwd: Photo - Adorable zoo

"Fwd: Picture -- Extra-terres- 

"Fwd: Photo- Extra-terrestri- 
als looking at adorable zoo ani- 
mals." 

"Fwd: Picture- Adorable zoo 
animals eating extra-terrestrials." 

And so on. 

It has gone to the point where 
people actually feel good about not 
sending forwards on. They'll send 
little forwards to all there friends 
saying "I'm not sending you this 
stupid joke because you've already 
heard or read it 2323,434 in your 
life." And they'll forward that 
piece of information to everyone 
they know. 

Recently an old friend signed 
up with some online lame humor 
website. They sent him lame jokes 
on the hour. Ever)' joke he received 
he forwarded to me. When I 
checked my account a day later, I 
literally had do/ens of "fwd: why 
did the chicken cross the road?" 
and "fwd: knock, knock." 

If it had been one or two, I 
would have opened them up and 



all. 

Another popular forward is 
the get-rich scheme. 

"Fwd: THIS REALLY 
WORKS! MAKE MONEY! PASS 
IT ON!" 

This forward was fir-.t initiat- 
ed by a Neanderthal named Ugh 
about 400,000 years ago. If he was 
still alive, he'd still be waiting for a 
profit. It's the standard pyramid 
scheme and it explains it usually 
like this: 

"Little Pauly's parents found 
$145,000 in his bedroom in cash! 
And it was all legal! This is how it 
works: Just attach your name and 
address to" the No. 3 position on 
this e-mail and forward it on! 
Then, people send you S2, the No. 
2 position $2 and the No. 1 position 
$5! As they pass it on, your name 
progresses up the chain until 
you're making $5 per person! The 




[Ihrnn-. 



Park, Little Island, 



This ad courtesy of the Office of the Chancellor 



Ugh, Ju 
Big Ocean. 

No. 3: PUT YOURSELF 
HERE! PASS IT ON! 

These forwards are big on 
exclamation points and assurances 
that it's not that risky of a scheme. 
I'm sure it's almost as ethical and 
financially secure as the stock mar- 
ket. A whole lot easier to under- 
stand, as well. 

Not that I'm a part of this 
scheme. But if you want to send 
me $5, feel free to forward it on. 

The cyberworld is also filled 
with naked people. These forward 
people are also forwarded. Not 
that I pay much attention to these, 
but it seems there are a lot more 
naked people in the cyberworld 
than in the real one. But I doubt 
that's why it's so popular. 

I mean, we don't use the 
Internet for dirty jokes and pictures 
and ways of getting rich by doing 
nothing and sending pointless 
"cute" photographs on and keeping 
UFO rumors flying, right? 

The Internet was established 
to help doctors communicate 
instantaneously and to keep fami- 
lies in touch even while thousands 
of miles away. 

It's a'tool for us to use when 
we're looking up information on 
our latest medical questions and 
new-gathering needs. Students 
and teachers can use it to find 
obscure facts about The Founding 
Fathers or the formations of plants 
on the ocean floor.

For the season, the team 
is 5-9 and has 14 more games 
remaining. 

In the last month, the 
team lost Dec. 10 to 
Valparaiso, 86-60; defeated 
Utah State 83-74; lost to 
Indiana State 104-61; 
downed Murray State, 78-72; 
defeated Morehead State 
102-82; beat Air Force, 83-70 
and lost to Colorado State, 
78-63. 

Even in their losses, 
Patterson said, the team has 
learned the lesson of hard 
play. 

"They played really 
hard in that game, and we 
couldn't help but be satis- 
fied," he said. "Our kids held 
up really well there," 
Patterson added. 

Tlie team continues to 



meld together, he said, with 
freshmen developing and 
upperclassmen taking on 
leadership roles. 

Amy Gearlds has been 
on fire for the Mastodons, 
scoring 30 points against 
Morehead State and 31 
against Air Force. Verea 
Bibbs has contributed sever- 
al double-doubles while 
Maggie Bruening and 
Courtney Nicley continue to 
keep the squad paced in 
their games, Patterson com- 
mented. 

Nobody is satisfied 
with the 5-9 record so far, 
believing they could be 
much closer to .500. 

Coming off of the holi- 
day season, the team travels 
to Big Ten country Friday, 
where they'll face Wisconsin. 



Patterson knows it won't be 
an easy test going into the 
second half of the season. 

"We're cautiously opti- 
mistic. For this team to be 
successful, we have to do 
two things. We have to con- 
tinue to play hard ... and 
we've got to stop turning the 
ball over. We average 
between 22 and 23 turnovers 
a game," he commented. 

If they could cut that 
number by seven or eight, 
those points could bring the 
team much closer in already 
close games, added 
Patterson. 

The team returns from 
Wisconsin and plays 
Chicago State Jan. 19 at 5 
p.m., and Wisconsin-Green 
Bay on Jan. 22 at Gates 
Sports Center, tip at 7 pm.

response 

temperatures ranging from five to 

5S degrees have covered the area 

for the past month while the 

Mastodons' play has been up and 



their last seven. Close losses to 
Purdue, Southeast Missouri State 
and Middle Tennessee State had 
the Mastodons losing by an aver- 
age of seven points. However, the 
average of loss to Miami (Fl.). 
Miami (Oh), West Virginia and Air 
Force was nearly 17. 

If feasible, a loss against 
Purdue was arguably the 'Dons 
most successful game during the 
winter break. Trading baskets with 
the then 17th ranked Boilermakers 
for the first 35 minutes of the game, 
the 'Dons were able to keep pace 
with an excellent West Lafayette 
squad. David Simon led the 
Mastodon charge with 19 points, 
followed up with 13 from Terry 
Collins and 10 by Keion 
Henderson. 

The significance of the victory 
could be measured by the final 
score, 80-69, however the notion 
that the team was able to hang with 
a Big Ten conference powerhouse 
program rich in tradition and 
headed by a prestigious coach was 
highly encouraging. And to an 
even higher extent, being competi- 
tive with a nationally ranked squad 
with only one loss on its record.

Miami (Fl.), a currently 10-5

out IPFW by 23 points on Dec. 30. 
Conference preseason All- 
American and nephew of NFL 
superstar Jerry Rice, Darius Rice, 
was able to put up 16 points with 
significant scoring help from his 
entire cast of teammates. IPFW's 
Simon put in 21 points and 
grabbed 10 rebounds, but unlike 
Rice, was unable to get help from 
his teammates. The guard tandem 
of Terry Collins and Beau Bauer 
combined for only 16 points and 
had seven turnovers. 

The Mastodons scored only 44 
points on just 26 shot attempts 
against the Air Force Falcons on 
Jan. 9. The Falcons are off to their 
best start in the program's 48-year 



history with a 9-2 record. They 
also rank number one in NCAA 
scoring defense, only allowing 47.2 
points per game. The 'Dons were 
unable to score for a 14 minute 
span in the contest -and turned the 
ball over 18 times. 

The most disheartening loss 
during the winter layoff was 
against Southeast Missouri State 
A 15-foot jumper from Brett Hale 
with less than a second left ended 
the 'Dons furious second-half 
comeback paced by David Simon's 
game high 22 points, 15 rebounds, 
5 blocks and 4 assists. Sophomore 
forward Brandon Jennings and 
Terry Collins played excellent in 
the loss combining for 31 points. 

The team also suffered three 
more discouraging losses over the 
winter break. Sophomore guard

arated shoulder. The "sixth man" 
was averaging almost five points in 
22 minutes per contest, but suf- 
fered the injury in the victory over 
Bowling Green State. He is recov- 
ering from surgery to repair the 
injury. His numbers were not a 
reflection of the spark he brought 
to the team while in the game. 

Starting forward Ric Wvand 
was ruled academically ineligible 
for the remainder of the season in 
the immediate days following the 
Christmas holiday. It was the sec- 
ond time the junior has been ruled 
academically ineligible in three 
seasons. He averaged 9.7 points 
per game this season. 

On Jan. 12, starting guard 
Terry Collins was suspended for, 
according to coach Doug Noll, 
"conduct detrimental to the team." 
The senior, who averages 1 2,3 
points per game, has since left the 
IPFW squad for the season, accord- 
ing to press reports. 

The Mastodons are now 2-13 
with 13 games remaining and will 
play at MAC school Western 
Michigan on Wednesday, Jan. 14, 
The more challenging stretch of the 
schedule is over, however; Butler^ 
Valparaiso and IUPUI remain. 

With the level of competition 
slightly lowering and winter tem- 
peratures steadying, the 
Mastodons hopt- to parallel those 
conditions with consistency on 



their behalf.
