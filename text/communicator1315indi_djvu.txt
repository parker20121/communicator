Cathryn Adam,sky Fund helps women in need 



When

an unexpeclc 
emergency arises, the slantlard sodal 
agency resources are often unavailable 
lo women. The Fori Wayne Feminists 
are trying 10 provide a fund to assiil In 
nich crises. 
Proceeds from the recent per' 



"Dreams, Myths and 
Other Lies'* given at the Fort Wayne 
Performing Arts Center by the Fort 
Wayne Feminists will benefit the fund. 
as will some of tlic proceeds from other 
such programs. Another project of the 
FWF Is the Coffeehouse at the YWCA 
VUlB on Wells SL 

The coffeehouse features women 
performing their own, or other 
women's poetry, tongs or writings from 
8 p.m. to 10 p.m. on the third Friday of 
each month. 



The coffeehouse is open to all women 
and, although a few of the special 
program meetings are dosed to men, 
generally men are welcome to attend. 

Some ol the proceeds from this 
project will also go toward the fund. 

The fund has been in eastmce since 
1977, hit was renamed last May at a 
party given to honor Adamsky before 
her departure to teach in New Hamp- 
shire on a leave of absence Iram IPFW. 

"Adamsky's Women's Studies 
classes led many people into FWF and 



the fund was renamed lo recogniie ncr 
contributions and concern for such 
women in need." said Jeanne Hickiing, 
treasurer of the FWF. Hickiing called 
Adamsky "a guiding mother-force" 
whose Women's Studies classes led 
many people Into FWF." 

According to Susan Heine, one of the 
live coordinators for FWF, Adamsky 
was one of the founders of FWF, which 
had Its beginnm^ m a group of SO 
women from a "Women's Awareness" 
dflss at IPFW in the early 1970s.

Unique to Hanukkah is the serving of 
lalkes and the playing of the dreydel 
game. Lalkes are a kind of potato 
pancake, and the dreydel game is 
played by children by spinning a small, 
four-sided top inscribed with Ihe letters 
which begin the words "Nes gadol haya 
sham." Hebrew for "A great mwacle 
happened there." Winners in this game 
are determined by which ieller comes 
up in an individtial's spin. 

The basis for Hanukkah also does not 
have Ihe importance ascritied to it that 
Chrialmas has lor Christians. 
Hanukkah celebrates the 176 B.C 
victory of the Jews over Antiochus IV. 
resulting in the rededi cation of the 
Temple in Jerusalem.

"The event probably records the first 
fight for religious freedom in which the 
sllempt of a community lo retain Its 
own religious heritage now comes

theme. 

Whereas Christmas recogniies the 
birth of the Messiah. Hanukkah 
celebrates Ihe first great viclory for
