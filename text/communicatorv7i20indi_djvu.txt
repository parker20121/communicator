ents, a student at IPFW who knows a hell of a lot about 
igned as vice-president of the student body this week. He refused 
lis reason for resigning. 
A good reason for his resignation might be fatigue. Besides striving for a B.A. 
degree in political science, Rollie has served in nearly every students' government 
post on campus: along with his post as vice president for 1975-76. he served on the 
Film Series for nearly three years, (wo years as Chairman; on the Joint Athletic 
Advisory Board three years, one year as Chairman; on the Convocations 
Committee, one year; Student Union Board, one year; Chancellor's Advisory 
Hoard; Chancellor's Search and Screen Committee; two years on Student Body 
President's Bureau of the Budget; and two years as a student senator. In the 
student senate, he served on three sub-committees: Constitutions, Internal Affairs 
and Appropriations. 

This guy didn't stop there He also participates in athletics at IPFW. He has 
been captain of the soccer team for two years, played one year of varsity 
basketball, and plays every intramural sport ever devised. 

The student body should not mourn Clement's resignation We should instead 
figure oul a way of reviving him, give him an award, and get htm started again. 

Hope we're wrong! 

The student senate at IPFW amended students' government in a major way at 
their last meeting Sunday, February 8. 

The most important revision was the consolidation of all entertainment 
[Unctions of students' government into one entity called Student Union Board of 
Governors (SUBOG). 

The new board will replace and unify three previously separate boards and 
committees, the Film Series Committee, the Student Union Board, and the 
Convocations ll Committee, along with the old Student Union Building council. 

The purpose of the revision, according to its creator. Student Senator John

SUBOG will consist of thirteen sludinl nienihers, with the Assistant Dean of 
Student Services as a nonvoting member. Ten of the thirleen student members 
will be elected in Ihe students government general election on the first week of 
March, and the other three members will be appointed by the president of the 
student 1-oilv, with the advice and consent nf the Student Senate. 
; The mission of SUBOG. according to Bill 7576-52, is to: 

-Create, maintain and amphly school spirit and cultural enrichment within 
the IPFW University community. 

-Plan and coordinate all cultural, entertainment and social activities, 

■-Coordinate and plan activities in such a manner as to achieve the widest 
possible involvement of all segments of the university community. 

-Promote tradilion.il and other social events. 

-Administer all publicity for the SUBOG and make coordinated efforts to 
promote all other student organizations or athletic teams whenever possible. 

-To prepare a single coordinated budget tor presentation to the student body 
president which will be presented to the Student Senate for approval. 

The key work in this major re-organi/alion is coordination. While we approve 
of and applaud the efforts of Students' Government to attempt such a major 
revision, The Communicalor tempers its enthusiasm for the SUBOG plan. 

The reorganization calls for ten elected members, who will join sixteen other 
candidates on any parly platform in the students' government elections. That 
makes a total of twenty-six persons are necessary to complete a ticket in the 
elections. 

Our subdued enthusiasm for the new plan centers not on any party finding 
twenty-six enthusiastic students who are willing to devote a year's hard work to 
effective Students' Govenment. but whether ,my party will find twenty-six students 
whoareactualh wilhnc to run. without any commitment to work towards election. 

We may be calloused We hope so We may be wrong. We hope that, too. At any 
rate, students' government deserves Ihe praise of the student body for an 
extremely well-thought out plan.

Introducin g Armv ROTC at IPFW 



Now you can graduate 

from lU-Purdue 

as an Army officer 



If you're a freshman or sophomore, 
you may be giving your future a lot of 
thought. 

Consider this. As an Army officer, 
you'll shoulder greater responsibility far 
earlier than most college graduates. 
That responsibility is to lead. To manage 
people, money and material. 

It's no wonder that many employers, 
looking for demonstrated leadership, 
rate "Army officer" above most other 
qualifications. Or why career-minded 
college students so often take Army 
ROTC. 

And now, lU-Purdue offers you 
Army ROTC courses on campus. So 
while you study for your chosen degree, 
you can also prepare for a commission 
as an officer in the active Army or 
Reserves. All current freshmen and 
sophomores are eligible. 



Sophomores: you must apply by 
April 1 for a special six-week summer 
program at Fort Know, KY., where 
you'll prepare, mentally and physically, 
for advanced ROTC. You'll earn over 
$500 while you're there. And incur no 
obligation until you register for ROTC in 
your junior year. It's then you start 
earning $100 per month (up to 10 months 
per year) for your last two years at 
lU-Purdue. 

Freshmen: you can pre-register for 
ROTC this spring and double upon 1st 
and 2nd year courses next year. Again 
with no obligation until your junior year. 

Veterans: if you have two or more 
years of college remaining, you already 
qualify for advanced ROTC and may 
pre-register this spring. 

For details, see your academic counselor 
or the ROTC representative in Room 288, 
Neff Hall or contact, Mai. Dick Reinholtz 
at 422-7808.
