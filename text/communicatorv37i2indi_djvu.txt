i of the IPFW 
music building is currently on 
schedule with plans to be com- 
pleted by fall of 2007. The 25 mil- 
lion dollar facility will house the 
music program as well as an au- 
ditorium. 

Between 80 and 100 workers 
are on the job with preparations 
for the building to be weather 
tight and enclosed by early Oc- 
tober. The workforce is expected 
to almost double once the winter 

With over 40 percent of the ex- 
terior brick put in place as well as 
the roofing work still in progress. 



the expectation is that the shell 
of the building will be completed 
within the following two weeks. 

Once the outside work is done, 
the work on the interior will 
begin. 

Greg Justice is the Project Man- 
agerforlPFW. He noted that there 
is a good amount of work to be 
done on the interior. "It is an ex- 
tremely complicated process," he 
said. "It takes up one half of one 
of my walls." 

The construction crew has yet 
to install the heating and cooling 
units as well as the mechanical 
equipment. 

Running into only one major 
snag, regarding issues with pre- 
used in the con- 



i, workers Worked over- 
time until the project was back on 
schedule. 

The music department is eager 
for the construction to be com- 
pleted. Robert Bean, the Chair- 
man of the Music Department, 
said that preparations are being 
made currently so when the build- 
ing is ready the department can 
move their offices as smoothly as 
possible. He said that physically 
the department is not doing any- 
thing, but they are in the planning 
stage. 

Chancellor Michael A. Wartell is 
eager to see the finished building 
as wejl. He commented, "It will 
have a wonderful practice area,

To Oxford and Back 



By Kira Schowe 

The heated debate of whether 
or not to teach Intelligent Design 
or evolution in the classroom re- 
sulted in a memorable opportu- 
nity for Arthur Friedel, professor 
of chemistry. 

Friedel traveled to Great Britain 
in July to present a paper at Harris 
Manchester College in the Univer- 
sity of Oxford. He joined 42 others 
who were selected to participate 
in a session of the Oxford Round 
Table entitled "Science and Faith: 
The Great Matter." 

Friedel, who had never been to 
Oxford before, described his ex- 
perience as "absolutely wonder- 
ful...the pinnacle of his 40 years of 
teaching." 

Just eating in the 17th century 
dinning hall and speaking at Ox- 
ford Union where a history of de- 
bates has taken place was unlike 
anything he had ever experienced, 
said Friedel. 

There were 42 people who had 
been invited to be presenters at 
the symposium in Friedel 's group. 



"They wouldn't tell us by whom, 
but it was someonewho had 
been there before," he said. 

The reason Friedel wrote this 
paper was because of the students 
in his Methods of Science Teach- 
ing class. 

"Students worry their knowledge 
of evolution will affect whether or 
not they will get a job in this area," 
Friedel said. 

Friedel's paper, titled "Beliefs, 
Conceptions, and Language: 
Helping Students Confront Cre- 
ationism and Intelligent Design," 
involved a survey of students in 
Chemistry 115, Physics 221 and 
Geoscience 100. According to 
Friedel, the more science educa- 
tion the students had the more 
comfortable they were with evo- 

"My students have taken many 
courses in biology, chemistry and 
physics, yet they don't grasp the 
concept of how knowledge in sci- 
ence is obtained. They find it hard 
to differentiate between scientific

seat auditorium and will be just a 
wonderful modern building." 

In order to find the building 
inquirers can glance upward, 
Framed by blue skies, two mas- 
sive cranes hover enigmatically 
overlooking the IPFW campus. 
Situated in between Hillard Gates 
Sports Center and Williams The- 
ater, the cranes mark the spot of 
construction of this new build- 
ing. 

"We are all just very, very ex- 
cited and delighted about this," 
Dr. Bean exclaimed. "We know 
that the community seems to be 
the same. 



Saturday School 
Offers Culture 



FORT WAYNE, Ind. - A school 
to help children of Japanese na- 
tionals working in the region 
keep pace with their former 
peers in Japan starts operations

ana University-Purdue Univer- 
sity Fort Wayne. 

Called a Japanese Saturday 
(JSS), the new program serves 
school-age children of Japanese 
workers posted to U.S. opera- 
tions of Japanese companies, 
adult workers and their family 
members, Japanese-American 
students and others. The school 
was jointly conceived and creat-

Luau Kicks Off Intervarsity Year 



By Allison Graber 

The second annual In- 
terVarsity Christian Fellow- 
ship cookout was held at 
IPFW on Thursday, August 
24. The luau, hidden from 
the main path, ushered in 
a new year of meetings for 
the group. 

Bright colored flowers 
were sprinkled in between 
the barbequed pork sand- 
wiches, cookies and chips. 
This food as well as soda 
was available to any stu- 



dent on their way to class. 

At one point, around two 
dozen people sat in chairs 
while "His grace is enough" 
played over the speakers. 

Gary Deguzrnam and 
Josh Pearson participated 
in a Sprite chugging con- 
test. After losing to Deguz- 
man, Pearson made his way 
to the edge of the woods in 
fear of becoming sick. 

Other students slopped 
by quickly, took some food 
and made their way toward 
class, DeAnte Dean was 
walking by but decided to 



stop and eat. 

"They said there is free 
food. It sealed the deal," 
said Dean. 

The leadership team did 
the planning for the event. 
"We've been working on it 
most of the summer," Ash- 
ley Quale, President of In- 
terVarsity said. 

Luminescence, the name 
for the InlerVarsity weekly 
meeting, kicked off the 
year at 7:30 that night.

Jessie Todd, a third year 
psychology student at IPFW 
and the vice president ofThe 
National Honors Society in 
Psychology, is the captain of 
Team IPFW for the 5K walk. 

When Todd learned that 
there are 1,300 people af- 
fected by HIV/AIDS in the 
Fort Wayne area who do not 
receive benefits, she knew 
she had to get involved. 
"People should care about 



the AIDS walk for this sim- 
ple reason; people in Fort 
Wayne are unaware of the 
problem that exists with 
AIDS, and that we do not 
have the funds we need to 
help these people," Todd 
said. This is the point of the 

Over 15 teams are regis- 
tered to participate in this 
year's walk. A roster that 
includes other universi- 
ties, such as St. Francis 
and Notre Dame, is a factor 
Todd hopes will motivate 
people to participate in the 
friendly competition be- 
tween schools. 

IPFW students and fac- 
ulty can support the HIV/ 



AIDS community by regis- 
tering for the walk or donat- 
ing money online at http://

"All you have to do is reg-

and show their support for

Ron Haas, who was diag-

felt the positive impact this

Force can have on one life.

director of entrepre-

academic standards and 
rigorous testing in the

Downtown Renovations Cause a Stir 



By Said EL-Adjani 



The metropolis of Fort Wayne, 
little as it may be, is growing. The 
legislation is thinking big, and at 
one point the state was actually 
thinking. 

Unfortunately, the incentive 
program, CRED (Community Re- 
vitalization Enhancement Dis- 
trict), which provided tax benefits 
to large-scaled projects for down- 
town, was "a little" misleading, 
slowing down the momentum of 
growth. 

The idea of expanding the down- 
town district was in serious talks 
late in 2002, with the launch of 
BlueprintPlus, a steering commit- 
tee to help guide the process and 
spearhead community consensus 
building. Coincidentally, this was 
the same time that job loss in Indi- 
ana began to level off. 

So it seems apparent and positive 
to me that the downtown is look- 
ing to grow, and establish more 
jobs, outside the field of manufac- 
turing, which is constantly taking 
a hit. 

With this idea of growth, comes 
an element I like to call aesthetics. 
Downtown is taking an approach 
to excite possible specific demo- 
graphics. 

Demographics, such as youth, 
are taken into account, by incor- 
porating projects such as a stadi- 
um, a new Irish pub and housing. 
Let's not forget the undergoing 
Journal Gazette /News- Sentinel 
construction, as well other critical 
job openings that will come with 
the downtown expansion.

heart of the city by bringing in

of the historical aspects of the 
area while saving some money. 

Now, if the city chooses to 
demolish the current buildings 
to construct a new baseball sta- 
dium the chances that the new 
stadium, would be well-utilized 
seems unlikely. 

The area tlnwn-

plan B Opens Mind 



By Tiffany Dirig 



Plan B is in effect. On Aug. 24. 
2006, the FDA approved over-the- 
counter emergency contraception 
(EC) — commonly known as the 
"morning-after pill" or "Plan B". 

When I read that on MSNBC, 
I didn't quite know how exactly 
1 felt. To tell you the truth, I still 
don't. 1 stalled and 1 procrastinat- 
ed before writing this article. 

I'd start and then walk away, 
fearful of my hesitation, but, ulti- 
mately, fearful of ambivalence. 

AS my deadline swiftly ap- 
proached, I realized that I'd have 



lor that I would. I am a woman of 
my word. 

That being said, I am also a 
woman trying desperately to 
break herself away from her par- 
ents' Influence and become her 
own, free-thinking person. My 
parents didn't raise a woman that 
vacillates on significant decisions. 
Plan B is a very significant deci- 

Because an over-the-counter 
morning-after pill is so big, it took 
me forever to work my way out of 
the nebulous "where-do-I-stand" 
hole. Eventually, though. I came 
up with my choice. Believeme.it 



The next sentence I'm about 
to say could get me tarred and 
feathered. 1 agree with the FDA's 
verdict. I think that EC is a dra- 

1 health. Moreover. I

ice versus pro-life level. That's 
at all how I see Plan B affecting

to true freedom. Granted, it 
begun as only a freedom that 



Who's to say that, in five or ten 
years (plus or minus, of course), 
the FDA doesn't allow all girls and 
women to have the right to receive 
emergency contraception? Or 
that, because of these painstak- 
ingly slow tortoise steps of permis- 
sion to have access to rights that 
should've been ours in the first 
place, women don't shatter that 
villainous glass ceiling? Or that 
we make a whole dollar to match 
every whole dollar men make? 

Perhaps you think I'm stretching. 
I mean, I can see where it would 
be entirely impossible to connect 



EC to glass ceilings and money 
But look at it from a political and 
social view rather than a moral or 
health awareness position. 

Women fought and bled for a 
more accessible form of emergen-

We got it. Now that we've been

Dropout Rates Increase 



By Jenna Tompkins 



Schools arc in crisis! Chances 
are if you attended high school 
around here you may not know 
what I am talking about. 

There are schools all around the 
country that are literally in tatters. 
Some schools have urinals ripped 
out of walls, broken windows and 
holes in the ceilings. 

Mostly the inner city schools are 
experiencing the lack of funds for 
repairs and technology upgrades. 
But don't think for one minute 
that it couldn't happen to a school 
around here because it can. 

Why are so many of us oblivious 
to the situation? Because it has 
not happened close to home, yet. 

Not only are the poor conditions 



in our schools reason for alarm debt. They have found them- 
but the dropout rates are just as selves submerged so deep the

Christian Fellowship Hopes 
to Develop Future Leaders 



By Allison Graber 
Chief Reporter 



Faint music hung on the 
breeze coupled with the wafting 
smell of food. Welcoming faces 
greeted students on their way 
to class just like the fliers hung 
on most doorways on the IPFW 
campus. 

The Luau on August the 22 was 
just one of the events InterVar- 
sity Christian Fellowship is host- 
ing this year. 

InterVarsity is a collegiate 
campus ministry started around 
70 years ago in the United King- 
Having been active at IPFW 
for 40 years, there are currently 
three chapters; the undergradu- 
ate InterVarsity chapter. Global 
Christian Fellowship and Voices 
of Inspiration Gospel Choir. 

With a beaming smile Nick 
Johnson, the area director for In- 
terVarsity, explained the groups 

"We want to see campuses 
renewed, students and faculty 
transformed and world changers 
developed." 

Meetings for the undergradu- 
ate chapter are held on Thursday 
evenings in Walb Student Union 
room G2 1 at 7:30 p.m. Featuring 
worship, speakers that challenge 
students in biblical truth and 
opportunities to commune with 
other students, the meetings are 
open to anyone. 

"While we have strong convic- 
tions about the source of truth 
.in*,) lift' we want to make it clear 




that students of different religions 
and backgrounds are welcome at 
all meetings," Nick said. 

Global Christian Fellowship, a 
branch of InterVarsity, meets three 
Sunday night-- a month off campus 
and once a month in Walb Ball- 
room for (he Culture Break. 

With between 30-50 students 
attending on average, this branch 
of InterVarsity does Bible studies, 
goes to conferences and retreats as 
well as promotes a friendship fam- 
ily program where international 



students meet local families. 

The Voices of Inspiration Gospel 
Choir, the third chapter of Inter- 
Varsity, does performances around 
the Fort Wayne area. 

With an involvement of around 
15 students, the choir is hoping to 
grow in numbers.InterVarsity is 
also sponsoring a national mission 
convention called Urbana. Held 
on December 27 through the 31 
the focus of the convention is on 
God's love for the world and what 
pan Christians play in that mis- 



Even with all these events dur- 
ing i he year, the main focus of 
the group remains their faith. 
Nick explained, "We believe 
firmly that God loves the cam- 
pus and InterV.trsiiy is commit- 
ted to the transformation of the 
campus and the structure and 
the people."

Tinseltown's Fall Forcast 



By Tiffany Dirig 



Fall is just around the corner. 
What does that mean for us? I 
mean, aside from the changes in 
the climate and trees, of course. 
For some of us, it means pulling 
out those over-sized sweaters. For 
others, it means throwing out those 
over-sized sweaters. For me — and 
many like me— it means a new 

In this article, I'm just going 
to give you, my faithful readers, a 
little taste of what to expect in the 
next four months. I'll talk about 
two or three that open each month 
and whether or not I think they'll 
be any good. So, let's get this show 
on the road. 

September 

Opening this Friday (9/1/06) is 
Nicolas Cage's newest flick, "The 
Wicker Man". This re-make of a 
1973 UK horror classic also stars 
Ellyn Burstyn, Kate Beahan. and 
Leelee Sobieski. 

It is about a sheriff who is in- 
vestigating the disappearance of 
a young girl living on a small is- 
land. What he doesn't expect is to 
uncover the secretive, neo-pagan 
community which is thriving. 

It's an interesting premise, but re- 
makes make me anxious. This one 
does have Ellen Burstyn, though; 
so that's a massive plus. It should 
be a good, creepy time. However, 
I doubt I'll see it in anything more 
than the dollar theatre. 

The next movie opens on the 
15th and I'm so excited about it. 
"The Black Dahlia" is period film 
that details the gruesome murder 
of burgeoning Hollywood starlet 
Elizabeth Short 

It stars Mia Kirsher, Josh Hart- 



nett, Aaron F.ckhart. Hilary Swank. 
and Scarlett Johansson. 

1 have been looking forward to 
this movie since I first saw the pre- 
views. As an added bonus, Mia 
Kirshner stars in one of my favorite 
shows and it opens the weekend of 
my birthday! Because of such, I'm 
willing to look passed the fact that 
Swank and Johansson have parts 
and watch it anyway. It's big of me, 

October 

Wow, some people just don't 
know when to quit. Opening on 
October 4th, "Employee of the 
Month" is the story of two slacker 
guys (Dane Cook and Dax Shepa- 
rd) that hear a rumor about the to- 
ken hottie (Jessica Simpson) who's 
willing to date the employee of the 
month. Naturally, they're falling all 
over themselves for the "honor". 

Written by two unknowns, this 
movie just reeks of suckiness. All 
of the core cast should've learned 
a long rime ago that movies aren't 
for them. I mean, Jess, honey, 
did "Dukes of Hazard" teach you 
nothing?! And, as much as I love 
Shepard's crazy antics, he should 
really stick to just that, crazy an- 
tics. The only saving grace may be 
Dane Cook. He's funny and he has 
great timing. But I'm not holding 
my breath. 

On October 20th, Sofia Coppo- 
la's newest movie swaggers into 
theatres. "Marie Antoinette" is die 
stylized recount of the young Vien- 
nese girl who became the ill-fated 
Queen of France at age nineteen. 
Now. this movie should, by all ac- 
counts, be terrible. I'm neither 
a fan of Coppola nor of Kirsten 
Dunst who plays the misunder- 
stood Queen. 

That being said, however, the 
supporting cast is amazing (Rip 



Torn, (ason Schwartzman, 
and Judy Davis to name a few) and I 
usually love styli/ed pieces. 1 don't 
know about this one. 

I can't believe they've done it 
again. On October 27th— just in 
time for Halloween, of course — 
Lion's Gate Films is releasing the 
third in a neverending series. "Saw 
III" is bound to be full of gratuitous 
gore and stupid, unsuspecting (but 
deserving) victims. 

The only star to return is Shaw- 
nee Smith who played Amanda 
Smith, Jigsaw's apprentice. Oops, 
I've said too much. Now you know 
the plot. 

The first one scared the absolute 
crap out of me. The second one 
made me want to vomit. The third 
won't even be worth seeing. 

November 

Why, oh why, does Hollywood 
make trilogies out of movies that 
were just fine being singles!? 
"The Santa Clause 3: The Escape 
Clause"— starring Tim Allen and 
Martin Short — comes out on No- 
vember 3rd; just in time to kick-off 
the holiday season. Lucky us. 

In this installment, Santa is 
faced with trying to keep his family 
together while trying to keep Jack 
Frost from taking over Christmas. 
If nothing else, this should be a 
cute family film. Allen and Short 
together should be at least mildly 
entertaining. Just don't expect too 

The day before Thanksgiving 
welcomes "Bobby". Written and 
directed by Emilio Estevez, this 
movie is the story of the 1968 as- 
sassination of US Senator, Robert 
Kennedy. It stars Harry Belafonte. 
Laurence Fishbume, Helen Hunt, 
and a long list of other big names. 
This one already has Oscar buzz. 
We'll see. 




21st Century Movie Classics 

Requiem 
Inspires 

By Tiffany Dirig 



December 



Not too much is known about 
Mel Gibson's newest flick, "Apoca- 
lypto". It opens December 8th and 
stars a group of relative newbies. 
The plot focuses on a doomed 
Maya kingdom. 

The rulers are insisting that their 
people need to build bigger tem- 
ples and offer more human sacri- 
fices. When one young man learns 
his fate, he flees the kingdom to 
save his life. 

I'm not too sure where 1 stand 
on this one. It looks good; it looks 
epic. I may wait until the dollar 
theatre for this one, too— unless 
my mom drags me with her before 
that. 

Will Smith's "The Pursuit of Hap- 
pyness" looks amazing. The trailer 
makes me cry. Starring as a strug- 
gling salesman, Smith takes cus- 
tody of his son (played by real-life 
son, Jaden Smith) and strikes out 
to start a new life on his own. I 
hope Smith has started writing his 
Oscar speech. 

Being the die-hard Angelina Jo- 
lie fan that I am, I couldn't let her 
new Hick go unnoticed. "The Good 
Shepherd" was directed by Hubert 
De Niro and also stars Matt Da- 
mon and foe Pesci, It is the story of 
the CIA through one man's eyes. It 

1 can't wait to see it. That could 
be because I haven't seen Angie in 
anything since "Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith", 
though. 

Well, there you are, folks; a little 
preview of what's to come. I can 
honestly say that this season's re- 
teases are full of promise. So, enjoy 
your trip to the movies. 



Never in my life have I ever truly 
felt a movie. I'm not talking about 
feeling it emotionally. I'm talking 
about feeling it mentally and even 
physically. Then again, never in 
my life had I seen "Requiem for a 
Dream". 

My best friend had been telling 
me for years that 1 needed to see 
"Requiem for a Dream"; but with 
the caveat that I needed to do so 
only when I was in a VERY good 

I decided to start something 
called "21st Century Classics". Ba- 
sically, it's a way to honor this cen- 
tury's best work as it unfolds {And, 
it's a way to keep me home with 
my kitty when his eyes are swollen 
shut!). 

Not every movie I see will receive 
this esteemed distinction, natural- 
ly But some movies are preternat- 
urally remarkable and deserve the 
award without a second thought. 

I think inducting "Requiem for 
a Dream" (2000) first is befitting in 
that it held a great many "firsts" for 
me personally. 

To start, I've never been so con- 
fused while attempting to operate 
the title menu of a DVD. I sat on my 
couch with my pitiful kitten curled 
on my lap trying desperately to fig- 
ure out why the menu looked like 
a screen off of the Home Shopping 
Network. I'm not lying; it look me a 
good three minutes to find "play". 
Once I found the button, I was 
thrust at full force into what can 
best be described as a downward 
spiral to a schizophrenic hell. The 
movie's entire 102 minutes of play 
was what I can only assume an 
acid-trip-gone-bad must be like. 
By the time the film's four main 
characters coil themselves into the 
fetal position at the very end, I was 
exhausted and sobbing. 

The him follows the lives of four 
drug addicts. Woven together with 
maniacal cinematography and a 
visceral sound track, "Requiem for 
a Dream" punishes the viewers as 
much as Hubert Selby, Jr.— author 
and screenwriter — punishes his 
characters. 

Each person's decent to their 
personal hell assaults the audience 
without thinking twice or feeling 
guilty. 

Expertly cast, the actors breathe 
life into characters that should, 
by all accounts, be six feet under. 
Jared Leto plays the lead, Flarry, 
a heroin addict with big dreams. 
Marlon Wayans is his best friend 
and "business partner", Tyrone. 
Ellen Burstyn plays Sara, Harry's 
addled mother. While Marion, 
Harry's girlfriend, is played by Jen- 
nifer Connelly. 

The plot, in all reality, is simplis- 
tic. But, as they say, less is more. 
Harry and Tyrone are addicts that 
begin selling, but soon run out 
of product and are forced to find 
other means of scoring money and 
drugs. Sara becomes obsessed with 
losing weight for a "never-gonna- 
happen" television appearance 
and ends up addicted to diet pills. 
Marion is a manic depressive ad- 
dict who will do anything for a fix. 
And I do mean anything. The rest 
is just how drugs take over — and, 
ultimately, end— their lives (figu- 
ratively speaking). 

I've never seen something so 
... 1 don't even have a word for it. 
It had crushing intelligence and 
heartless honesty. It was painfully 
unforgiving, while being inexplica- 
bly (oucliing at the same time. 
When it comes down to it, I'm split 
about this movie. Half of me wants 
to scream from the rooftops that 
everyone should see it immediate- 
ly. While the other half, wants hide 
in a corner of my bedroom, behind 
a closed, locked door, and cry for 

I know I'll buy it. I may even 
gather the courage to purchase the 
unrated version; but when I do, I'm 
sure I'll only watch it once a year. 
That kind of masochism is difficult 
to accept more than once.

IPFW Golf Preview 



By Kira Schowe 

IPFW's Golf teams are ready 

once again to slarl off their sea- 
son. Coach )eff Marsh, who has 
coached here for just over 4 years, 
believes this year will be different 
then the past because of experi- 



Head Golf Coach 
Marsh said, 
"They're re- 
ally not playing 
against another 
team, they have 
to understand 
they are play- 
ing more against 
themselves and 
the golf course." 



are going to play, they know now 
what college golt is all about.. .they 
don't gel as nervous as much now 
going to tournaments because 
they know how to handle things 
epically on the golf course, they 
feel much more comfortable." 
Marsh said. 

With the strengths being, "ex- 
perience and quality of play," the 



expecialioiis for this year are, "al- 
ways from a academic standpoint 
the number one men academic 
team," which they have won 3 of 
the last 4 semesters, "and the ladies 
team also now has that on the top 
of their list," Marsh said. 

"From a playing standpoint the 
men have gotten very good, they 
have had three years to prepare. 
They are experienced now and this 
year we would like to actually win a 
tournament. I think they are defi- 
antly good enough to do it," Marsh 

From the ladies standpoint, 
"they are a year behind and they 
are young," with only 2 juniors, 
3 sophomores and 3 freshmen, 
"so we are focusing more on their 
score. After the first year the ladies 
dropped 30 shots off their average 
and this year their goal is lo drop 
another 20," Marsh said. 

The biggest obstacle this year 
for both teams will be, "the players 
themselves." Marsh said, "they're 
really not playing against another 
team, they have to understand they 
are playing more against them- 
selves and the golf course. It's very 
different then other sports where 
you actually have an opponent, we 
have no control of what the other 
teams are going to do." 

As far as what the teams expect 
out of this year Marsh said, "we al- 
ways have a goal of continuing to 
move forward and continuing to 
improve, as long as they remem- 
ber lo play within themselves...

myself, what will come is what that I kept in my bag and every 
will come." time I got a little to mad I would 

take it out and squeeze it."

From pg 7 



said that, like other division 
one schools, our students 
from the dorms should 
come out and support the 



"Like the men's volleyball 
team. I appreciate them 
dressing up and being sup- 
portive. Absolutely great. 
It's infectious if only the kids 
in the dorms could see it," 
sit'fankiewicz said. 

During the first half of the 
match the Men's Volleyball 
team marched into Heffner 
Field chugging like a train. 
By the second half they were 
singing The Killers. 

"Come out and support 
us." Stefankiewicz said. 



On Sunday, the ladies 
played Central Michigan 
who had beaten Michigan 
State 3-2, but the lady mast- 
odons failed to connect and 
lost to Central Michigan 3-0. 
Later this week, the Ladies 
will meet up against New Jer- 
sey Institute of Technology, 
Utah Valley, and Morehead 
State. All of these games will 
be played at Hefner Field. 

Don't forget what Coach
