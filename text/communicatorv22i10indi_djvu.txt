Toxic Dumping 

Exportation of garbage 
abuses Third World 

Recently, the City of Brotherly Love (Philadelphia) tried to 
dump 14,000 tons of toxic ash on 1 1 ■*-- shores of Haiti. The captain 
of the crud boat told the Haitians ii was lertili/er. The Haitians 
didn't buy it and made them scoop the goop back up. 

An American lobbyist approached the people of the Marshall 
Islands with a plan to "augment " their land mass with 10 
percent of the west coast's garbage. When the Islanders ex- 
pressed reservations .ihnui llns plan, the lobbyist said not to 
come crying to him when the Greenhouse Effect causes their 
islands to flood. Evidently. I he residents nl (he Marshall Islands 
decided it was a risk worth taking. 

Back in the 70s, on the Puerto Itican islands of Penuelas and 
Guayanilla, petrochemical dumping was slopped because of the 
dramatic rise in cancer cases among the populace. When the 
companies pulled out, they left the people not only dying but 
unemployed. 

Lately, various waste incineration companies have ap- 
proached these same islands. "Hey, as long as you guys i

Sam, at a blue-light special. 

At least the operators of the U.S. Scientific Station Palmer 
have the right idea: When they dump their raw sewage, heavy 
metals and lab chemicals in the sea, they can do it with a clear 
conscience. They can't give cancer to ice. 

All of these little anecdotes were gleaned from recent issues 
of Greenpeace magazine. While the Greenpeace group may be 
considered biased and radical hy some, they nevertheless go to 
great pains to verily then stones and cite their sources. But 
even if they didn't, very few of us would doubt them. Western

Letters to the Editor 

Vice presidents call for Snyder's impeachment 




The Student 
Students' Government 

Felix Moxter and his Procedures Committee has been tussling 
with the problem of how to write SAB into the Students' Gov- 
i problems implied 
with including SAB is that the senate is a body designed to 
spend money while SAB should be designed to make money. 

5 given a decent starting budget of $75,00 
the results would be amazing. The activities board 
mediately move to add facilities (hat would expand its input on 
campus like adding a Ticket ron ottice. sponsoring small con- 
ventions by off-campus groups that would appeal to the student 
population and expanding its base of free events around cam- 
pus. For instance, SAB could sponsor a computer software expo 



nity. Also, the 

board would be able to lock into part of the speaking tours of 
world renowned experts on everything from humor in the '90s to 
world relations with a new emerging Eastern Europe. 

SAB could also sponsor smaller events like movie and concert 
paraphernalia sales, plant sales, book sales and any other type 
of sale that would appeal to IPFW or the community at large. 

Eventually, the student board would be able to move into the 
realm of sponsoring musical acts, on campus and in venues like 
the Coliseum. 

Along with these obvious benefits to campus life, there would 
be improvements in other areas as well. Instead of getting a 
budget every year, SAB could potentially make enough money 
to pay a percentage of its earnings back to the university each 
year in the form of rent. All the other remaining monies would 
be carried over to the next year for its new beginning budget.

To cut SAB free from the reins or the student senate would 
actually improve student life, provide employment and make 
the Student Activities Board more of an asset to IPFW and the 
Fort Wayne community as well. It is a valuable proposal that 
should be taken seriously by the senate and administration.
