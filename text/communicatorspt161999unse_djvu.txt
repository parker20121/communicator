Chancellor Michael Wartell also agrees the nags 
are a nice addition to the campus and help distin- 
guish IPFW, while representing the various parts of 
the university. 

"It seemed appropriate to represent 
all of the organizations of which we are a 
part. The six flag poles were meant to do 
that, and it sets off our main entrance,"

about confusing sisns arc not uncommon. 

"Some of the most frequent com- 
plaints we get from the community and Trom 
first time visitors are that, one, the campus 
isn't readily Identifiable and, two, once you 
get on campus, you can't find your way

As part of an effort to make the main entrance of campus d| 
more noticeable, six flags now mark the entrance off of

SAB president receives 
national recognition 



by Cam'eAnne Leathers, 
News Editor 



Due to her campus involvement and leadership, 
Jence Johnson was chosen by IPFW to attend the 
LeaderShape Institute where she was named one of 59 
Amerltech Fellows for 1999. The Institute is a leadership 
development program attended annually by students 
from universities across the country. 

Johnson's involvement on campus Includes being 
president of the Black Collegian Caucus, Student 
Ambassador (1998). Pro-temp of SAB (1998-99) and being 
named best new orientation assistant ( 1998). 

She was also named head delegate to the NACA con- 
vention In Charleston, W. Va., and was the representative 
to the National Conference on Student Services in 
Washington, D.C 

She Is a member of the Diversity Council (1998, 
1999), was elected vice president of the student body pro- 
gramming and Is the current SAB president and parlia- 
mentarian of the Tau Gamma Chapter of Delta Sigma 
Theta. 

Johnson has also had other Involvements In the com- 
munity. This involvement, according to Kim Jacobs, direc- 
tor of Student Activities, Is why Johnson was chosen to 
attend the program. 

"She has shown Increased Involvement and has taken 
on increased leadership roles and 1 think that's why Jenee 
came to our minds as an Ideal candidate," said Jacobs. 

For Johnson, the six-day leadership development pro- 
gram was highly beneficial, teaching her things both 
about herself and about her leadership roles at IPFW. 

"It's up to us (SAB) to show students that there is a 
fun side to IPFW and a place where they can voice their 
opinions," Johnson said. "Everybody there had so many- 
leadership roles (at their schools)-lt motivated me to hear 
what kinds of things they were doing and see what could 
be applied to our campus. There were a lot of Ideas that 
could work for our campus." 

This was the first year IPFW sent a student to the pro- 
gram and, according to Jacobs, the university sees it as a 
"great leadership development opportunity." 



Anthropology gets laboratories

gy department at IPFW 
oratories in the basement of Kcttler, there 
had not even been an actual lab in which 
to perform anthropological work. Now, 
however, the new labs arc not only up to 
current federal standards of security and 
curatlon guidelines, but there is more 
students and faculty to work and 



store materials. 




"We absolutely had

al resource managemen 


for anthropology 


and assistant professor 


"Because of the

classes, meetings), 
"We nave allocated space now and 
lots of tables to lay things out for cata- 
loging, 11 Smith said. "There is also more 
plain elbow room so that we can function 
better and students arc getting their own 
lab and drawer space." 

This week was also national archeolo- 
gy week and although the archeology sur- 
vey has been bus) moving into the new 
lab. Smith welcomes anyone interested to 
stop by the lab. 

"We arc showing people around, 
showing the community if the) have 
an interest. People can also bring in 
artifacts for Identification," Smith 
said. 

The other new anthropology lab is 
for ethnology with the main purposes 
of housing collections of both ethnolo- 
gy and bioanthropology collections, 
leaching lab courses, holding lectures 
and seminars, and doing lab research. 
Associate professor of anthropology 
Lawrence Kuznar is very' pleased with 
both new labs. 

"What we used to have was com- 
pletely inadequate and so we are very' 
happy to have this facility," Kuznar 
said. "We've got place now not only to 
store materials, but to use them and 
we are very excited about it." 

Kuznar agrees with Smith about 

?the new curation facilities, as well, and 
is very glad the facility Is now up to 
current federal standards.

New show, luncheon efforts to increase awareness about IPFW athletics 



by CarrieAnne Lealhers, 
News Edilot 



Both a new weekly television show and luncheon arc part 
of the department of athletics' attempt to keep the communis 
and campus belter Informed of IPFW athletics. 

"The object is to highlight every athletic program that we 
have on campus and let every body know what we have here." 
said Mike Jewel, Sports Information Director. "This is one way 
to get the word out." 

The first television show. "Mastodo 
earlier this week and will be airing or 
Sunday at noon. Men's and women's soc&gt; 



i Spotlight." was taped 
Friday at S p.m. and 
or coaches were on the 



"It went really, really well. They talked about their upcom- 
ing year and their expectations," Jewel said. "Each week there 
will be different teams, what they achieved over the last week 
and what ihey plan to achieve. Flayers will also be highlighted." 

The Royal Dons Luncheons, every Monday at noon in Walb 
Union, are for fans, boosters, friends of IPFW athletics and any- 
one else Interested in learning more about what is going on 
with IPFW athletics. The luncheon begins at 11:45 a.m. and is 
followed by a question and answer session with coaches. 

"The point of having luncheons Is to try to get everybody 
aware of what we arc doing and also letting them know thai we 
want them to be Involved with what we are doing," Jewel said. 
"We need to be the university that everybody sees (in the Fort 
Wayne area)." 

The "Doug Noll Show" and the "Arnlc Bali Show" will also 



ntinue to air later in the year. 

According to Waller Bowman, director of athletics, it is 
ientlal for IPFW to get the communii) more Involved and 
crested in IPFW for the university and its athletic programs 



Bowman, along with other members of the athletics depart- 
ment, is Interested in looking at becoming Division I. He 
believes community and media involvement are essential. 

"If the media and community and alumni get behind us, it 
will happen," Bowman said. 

According to Bowman, there is only two cities in the coun- 
try with the population size of Fort Wayne whose universities 
arc not Division I. IPFW Is one of the two.

IPFW's atmosphere could change with dorms 



WHATWETHINK: Campus housing 
would bring ihelPFW community logelner. 

WHAT DO YOU THINK? Sendyoure- 
maD response lo 

stupaper6holmes.iprw.edu or a leller la 
Wab215. 

Think about living In close prox- 
imity to a significant number of stu- 
dents. Imagine walking down the 
sidewalks of IPFW and seeing two of 
your" roommates, ten of your neigh- 
bors and many of your friends 
almost everyday. Now visualize a 
Tilled cafeteria and a very bustling 
Walb Union everyday. We believe 
this could be the future of IPFW If 
dorms arc built. 

In order for dorms to even be 
considered on this campus the sur- 
veys all of you received in the mall 
from the chancellor should be com- 
pleted and returned by tomorrow. 
IPFW will wait a couple days for any 
stragglers. The final results should 
be allied by mid October. 

According to Walt Branson, vice 
chancellor of financial affairs, there 
was not too much Interest In dorms 
until two or three years ago. Since 
then, the request for dorms has been 
continuing. Branson says that par- 
ents would say something like, "If 
you had dorms 1 would send my kid 
to IPFW." The surveys sent out to the 
student body are a way for IPFW to 



take a closer look at the situation. 

We appreciate the fact that student 
voices are being heard. The possibili- 
ty of dorms may someday become a 
reality based on a variety of factors. 
First of all the surveys have to 
show that there is an interest In the 
dorms. Then there has to be a place 
to build the dorms. Branson says 
they are looking seriously at proper- 
ty across Crescent to the east of cam- 
pus. McKay farm Is too far away. 
Finally there has to be a developer 
who Is willing to work on the dorms. 
The dorms would not be state-fund- 



ed, instead they would be funded by 
the developer. 

There are many Its in the dorm 
deal: If the results show a high Inter- 
est in dorms, If there Is a place to 
build them, and IT a developer Is 
willing to fund dorms and work on 
the project, then they will become a 
reality. Branson says If all goes well 
without any delays whatsoever IPFW 
could have dorms by the fall of 
2001.

ter too much. Perhaps you're gradu-

IPFW is so spread out- Some of

also some people who are not from

There are free dances, seminars 
and concerts going on every week. 
Students who are busy working or

campus community if everyone Is 
leaving it behind and not enjoying a 
great deal of what is has to offer? 

Once again we ask you to think 
about what It would be like If you 
and all your friends could live closer 
together. You could enjoy events at

work, be Involved In an activity and 
never leave Fort Wayne. Think about 
all the endless possibilities. 



IPFW needs 

community 

support 

by, CarrieAnne Leathers, News Editor 




5 shocked last week when a local 
member of the media asked Walter 
Bowman, director of athletics, if he really 
thought the media had an effect on IPFW. 

1 heard this while attending a press 
conference Bowman had organized to 
address the possibility- of IPFW becoming 
a Division I program. He also stressed 
how Important the media's role Is In 
accomplishing this goal. Yet, from their 
reaction, It was apparent to me that some 
of the media still does not realize Just 
how Important their rule Is. 

To be quite frank, I think the media 
In Fort Wayne has a huge effect on how 
people look at the university. Would It 
actually hurt for the community to hear 
hings about our university and 



lop pos 



ttltude; 



about what 






happens here? It surely could 

The truth of the matter is IPFW Is an 
excellent school. Many students who 
graduate from here are highly successful 
and the faculty Is outstanding. That can- 
not be stressed enough— IPFW truly has 
an outstanding, dedicated, and 
knowledgeable faculty. 

Many of the students at IPFW sup- 
port themselves while attending school. I 
know students who work 20-10 hours a 
week, take care of families, and still man- 
age to get by. Students at campuses with 
dorms do not have to deal with nearly so 

So It really did amaze me that the 
press conference participants were so 
shocked by the Idea that the media might 
try having a better attitude about IPFW. 

1 will say the local newspapers have 
had some good stories about the universi- 
ty and I commend them Tor this. It is 
greatly appreciated. 

However, I'd like to know what is 
said about IPFW off-the-record, not Just 
by the media, but by everybody In the 
area. That Is Important, too, and the pil- 
lars of our community need to be saying 
good things— not because IPFW wants 
them to lie, but because there really are 
good things to be said about IPFW. 

To anybody in the community who 
may read this and needs to understand 
why IPFW Is such a good school, I suggest 
you come here and talk to students and 
talk to professors. Watch how hard the 
athletic teams practice and the various 
clubs function. Maybe even get involved 
In something. IPFW wants the community 
to be Involved— we need the community's 
support. 



With our own hands 



by, Darci L. Denton, Staff Writer 

A dear and longtime friend of 
mine died this summer from com- 
plications that resulted from fight- 
ing sugar diabetes for a quarter of a 
century. She was 32 years old and 1 
know for a fact that she did not 
want to die. 

Around the same time, 1 
received a phone call Informing me 



Shai 



mother inbib 



:entl&gt;- r 



t had c 



t that 



He wasn't quite 30 years old 
and, at the time I met him, he 
seemed relatively happy and In 
very good health. 

My Triend may have had "dia- 
betes, but she w-as very stable emo- 
Uonally. She knew what was Impor- 
tant In her life and she surrounded 
herself with the things and the peo- 
ple that she loved. 

The young man who killed 
himself may have been unstable 
emotionally, but I'm sure that my 
friend would have envied his physi- 
cal health. For some unfortunate 
reason, he Tell that his life was no 
longer worth living. 

None of us know for sure what 
makes some people take their own 
life, but I'll bet it has something to 
do with feeling all alone. I'm not 
afraid to admit that there have 
been times in my life when I felt 
like throwing In the towel, but 1 
have been lucky enough to have 
been blessed with a handful of peo- 
ple who have loved and supported 
me through the sunshine and the 
fire. 

So many of us tend to attribute 
weakness of character to suicide 
victims without taking the time to 
appreciate the fact that maybe 
those of us that do not fall prey to 
this "solution" are Just a little bit 
luckier at the game of life. 1 person- 
ally feel that the way we have come 
to live as a people has greatly con- 
tributed to our downfall and has 
created a negadve ripple effect that 
sometimes leads to self-des true Don. 

With advanced civilization 
comes estrangement, a kind of dis- 
tancing between people that Is fust 
not natural. If It Is true that we all 
come from hunting and gathering 
societies, then It must ajso be true 
that from the beginning we have 
been a close-knit species that has 
had to rely on Inter-communlcation 
and strict cooperation. People 
today strive to be Independent of 
one another (I'll worry about me 
and you worry about you) and 
thereby place themselves in an 
emotionally Independent, and 
sometimes vulnerable, situation. 

Independence is a wonderful 
thing in a lot of the situations that 
people face today, but it can be 
fatal if we feel 



Why are we so ashamed of being 
human? Why does our society send 
the message that asking for help 
means weakness! Why don't we 
always notice It when our fellow 
man is in trouble? 

1 don't know enough about the 
history of the world to give the 
exact point we began to place so 
much importance on being inde- 
pendent of one another, but I'd 
venture to say that those of us who 
are the mosl emotionally Indepen- 
dent would be the least likely to 

sonally doubt that we will experi- 
ence much more than an inconve- 
nience or two, but the Y2K comput- 
er glitch that wc have been hearing 
so much about may be a minuscule 
opportunity for us to discover Just 
how cooperative and Gestalt-mlnd- 
ed the bulk of us arc. We had better 
all cross our fingers: In the event 
that we should need to reach out to 
our fellow man, whether It be for 
food, shelter, protection or a caring 
heart, wc should be able to know 
that he, too, will reach out and help 
us to carry our toad. 

What a shame It would be if 
our species ended up becoming 
extinct because as a people we had 
become too selfish to help or too 
lost to reach out. I watch The 
Discovery Channel and find that 
some species of mammals (which 
are commonly regarded as mere 
animals and therefore below 
humans In the chain of Importance) 
treat one another better and more 
gently than most of the people 1 
know. I haven't given up on us, 
though; I still believe that most 
people want to be good. Maybe 
we've Just forgotten how important 
It Is that each and every generation 
teach the next how to love and how 
to communicate effectively. 

Suicide leaves the living In a 
state of confusion and creates ■■ im- 



position to communicate this to us. 
Each of us, In our own time, will 
experience death. Life Is a train that 
we board the day we are born and 
wc can never slow down. The only 
control that we have is the ability 
to speed up the ride: Most folks call 
it suicide, and many even call It sin. 
The right or wrong of it does 
not concern me as much as the why 
of IL I think that part of It may be 
that we don't live In a,.world where 
it's okay to be In pain", especially ir 
you are male. One or.the things that 
1 appreciate about b'emg-femsle ts- 
ihai society allows me to be afraid, 
lonely, hurt and helpless without 

(Don't let me be too strong, though, 
because by not being dependent 
enough, I then become a threat.) 
Society expects women to be the 
emotional ones and men to be 
mostly self-controlled emotionally 
and to never have a weak moment. 
The "dmes may be a changing" but 
we aren't finished yet. We've got a 
long way to go before we accept 
one another for all that we arc. In 
the meantime, we arc creating 
human beings who are constantly 
being asked by society not to be all 
of who they really arc. 

I don't claim to have all the 
answer), but I do claim that we had 
better, as a society, pay closer 
attention to one another. 
Sometimes we reach out to one 
another In subtle ways, but I 
believe that we can help prevent 
such senseless tragedies from 
occurring by getting to know one 
another better. Understanding one 
another takes practice just like any- 
thing else If we want to be good at 
it. Personally, 1 want to help when 1 
can and I don't think that I'm 

Maybe we should start by look- 
standing our own pain. For mc, the 



more I get to know myself the bet- 
ter I am at communicating with 
other people. If we can't communi- 
cate, we can't help one another. If 
we can't help one another, the least 
we can do is try to help ourselves 
and reach out if we feel the load of 
life getting us down. 

In my mind, It takes a wise and 
courageous person to recognize 
when he needs help and to ask for 
II In my mind, it takes a caring and 
.altruistic person to recognize whorf 
5 his fellow man Is in need, and iq

friend and my heart goes out to her

entific community for the answers 
and the cures. All I can do now is 
what I did when she was alive: I 
donate what I can to the Juvenile 
Diabetes Association and I pray to 
the powers that be. 

Suicide may be considered a 

problem that I foresee being elimi- 
nated by science or medicine. 
Scientists and doctors may come up 
with cures for some of the diseases 
that cause those afflicted to want to 
die, but that's about all they can do 
for the problem. It's up to us, as a 
people, to reach out to one another 
and to try and heal the woes that

thing In life can be passed off to

Extreme 96.3 supports local music scene 



by EricBaus, 
Features Editor 



Extreme 96.3 f.m. was 
created in September of '95 as 
an alternative to Fort Wayne's 
primarily mains tream-orient- 
ed radio stations. The station's 
playllst Includes an eclectic 
range of local musicians, 
emerging naUonal artists and 
bands that blend several musi- 
cal genres together. Much of 
the music 96.3 plays fits 
somewhere between punk, 
indie rock, hip hop and elec- 
tron lea. 

One of 96.3's primary 
goals Is to give exposure to the 
local music scene. Since lis 
beginning. 96.3 has been 
Involved In promoting local 
acts through several commu- 
nity musical events. In the 
past, 96.3 has sponsored 



many IPFW-related events, 
Including a performance by 
popular Fort Wayne based Sta 
band 5kavossas. 

Every Sunday night at 9 
p.m. 96.3's Michael Dean 
hosts "Extreme Essentials," a 
program that showcases local 

"I really believe in the 
show on Sunday nights and 1 
enjoy having the opportunity 
to play local musicians," said 
Dean. "It's nice If I can play 
their songs on the radio and It 
gets somebody's attention 
because I know what the 
bands are going through to 
make It out there." 

In an attempt to bolster 
Fort Wayne's music scene, 
96.3 annually releases an 
"Extreme Essentials' compila- 
tion CD of regional artists. 
There has been a great deal of 
Interest from local bands and 
96.3 has received somewhere 




between ISO and ZOO submis- 
sions for the upcoming CD. 
Although the submission peri- 
od is over for this year. It Is 
still undecided which bands 
will be included. After the 
demos arc collected, 96.3 
tums them ever to profession- 
als in the musk industry who 
make the Final judgments. 

"We've sent all of the sub- 
missions to record reps in the 
business and they are in con- 
stant contact with the radio 
station," said Dean. "If s really 
a great opportunity for local 
bands to get exposed to peo- 
ple In the recording Industry," 
Dean added. 

"We're expecting to 
release the CD sometime In 
late December, but It all 
depends on how soon we get 
the submissions back from the 
judges," explained Dean. 

The CDs will available at 
Wooden Nickel record stores 
around town. 

Although 96.3 is con- 
cerned with giving 
regional artists exposure 
to a larger community, it 
is also very Interested in 
bringing a broad range 



fill. Everyone in our RV got 
along and we had a great time 
covering the event." 

Besides standard playlists. 
Extreme 96.3's schedule 
includes many dilfcrent kinds 
oT programming. Radio per- 
sonalities J.J. and Chad host a 
weekday morning show from 
6 to 10 a.m. Adam Corolla and

the most exciting and liberat- 
ing decades in experimental 
Jazz history: the 'GOs. With 
John Coitrane. Charles

Post-Game Report 

by Brian Miller, 
Sports Editor 

The hcadliner this week was the men's performance in 
the Cross Country Invitational. However, that wasn't the only 
news IPFW made m the Invitational The women's cross 
country team also hadmembers of the soccer team run leith 
than. They did quite well actually Andrea Cappclli fin- 
ished 5th on the IPFWside with a time of 26:13.1 whde her 
teammates. Jamie Rebman, Lialah Marlew. NikiStrack 
and Sally Hilger were right behind 

Also on the topic of women's soccer, the team had 60 
percent of shots on goal for the season against Hillsdale. 
Although unable to net the first goal, the team is showing 
much improvement. Goalin lltt^rr m-orJed 27 saves that 
game whde fellow goalie and Carroll alum on the men's 
side. Jeff Rickey, didn't even see a shot in both of his games 
this past week. 

Turning to men's soccer, how about Mark Watson who 
netted four goals m only two games? Watson, along with 
Matt Hem and Chris Kramer, is giving the team consistent 
scoring. The team is now ranked 4th in the Midwest Region. 

Oh yeah, how about the Sumner Suites Invitational, 
which boasted 12 matches in two days? The Dons won two 
out of three and improvedtheir recordto 5-4. 

The women's tennis team split II this week, with a dis- 
appointing toss to Lewis. However, the team is still aeon 
tender in the GLVC. This should be jus
