The original concept tor PAW was 
put forth at the Convocations Commit- 
tee meeting of September 22, 1971 by 
John Mann, Student Government Press 
Officer. On October 4, 1971, a motion 
was made by Sharon Gebct to allocate 
all extra convocations money to Poli- 
tical Awareness Week. It passed un- 
animously. 

Each "cultural neck" is to be handled 
by a sub-commlttce consisting of half 
Convocations members and half mem- 
bers of the initiating organization. 
Sharon Gabct and Stan Jones were 
appointed to represent the Convocations 
Committee. Dave James and Mark 
Souder represent Student Government. 
This sub-committee controls the finances. 

On March I, a special session of the 
Student Senate was called to resolve 
some financial problems concerning 
Political Awareness Week. With 12 of 16 
members present, an emergency bai was 
introduced, circumventing usual com. 
mittee procedure. Senator Dan Richert 
moved passage and Ruth Goegteln 
seconded. The bill passed unanimously. 
It read as follows:

ganizational work involving many stu- 
dents, faculty and administrators; and 

Whereas, the Mayor and all the leading

Whereas, hundreds of hours of work 
have already been put into Political 
Awaienes Week; and

concerning the program's potential and 
will partially Judge our campus by the 
program's success or failure; and 

Whereas, the success of the Week is 
dependent upon the entire package; and 

Whereas, a representative of the Business 
Office gave the Student Government 
Treasurer. Dave James, and other univer-

Whereas, the Convocations- Student

vised Its figures, leaving the Week over- 
committed and short of funds; and 

Whereas, the money Is needed urgently

COMMUNICATOR 



Black Nation meets in Gary, plans for future 



By Obic Booker 

Some at us have uren the Black In the 
rbKt civilization or the World. Most of 
us have wen the Black begin the Iron In- 
dustiy, die In the American revolution, 
lland on the North Pole and die in Viet 
Nam. Wc luive seen Black labor In the 
■ugar that we use. All of us have seen 
the Black In sports, cotton Ticlds, churches 
and riots. None of us have seen the Black 
IncBvcK. Our seeing has been through 
true history. 

On March 11-12, 1972 four students, 
JacquI Seals, Marcus Wallace, Tommy 
Clancy and myself saw the Black In 
real politics. 

There were over 6.000 people 
attending the National Black Political 
Convention In Gary, Indiana. This con- 
vention was organlitcd by Mayor Hatcher, 
Congressman Olggs and others. This was 
an historical event In that such a con- 
vention was never held In this magni- 
tude. 

All the diverse groups of Blacks were 
represented and Invited. The Black 
Panther Party. The Muslims, The Liber- 
ation Army, The Uncle Toms, the "rich", 
the poor, the Negto, the colored folks,. 
the Afro-Americans, but they were 
brought together by their blackness. 

Blacks were made aware of the fact 
that wc should not get hung-up on the 
small differences that divide blacks: but 
we should work together on the prob- 
lems thnl bind blacks. These differ- 
ences or dlsigrcemonts ore well cstjib- 
llshcd by the white press. 



I feel that everyone left this conven- 
tion with something to do. somethig 
to think about, something to show and 
something to Ull the world. This Is 
what Marcus Wallace had to ay: 'The 
Black Political Convention represents 
what the Black Amerlran can do once 
given the chance. My overall view of 
the convention was that it was a suc- 
cess In more ways than one. First of 
all It was a great accomplishment In 
as much as it was the first time Blacks 
had gathered together in modem times 
to discuss the problems of our modern 
society and oF the coming Presidential 
election, and to motivate in Blacks the 
power of Political Power and in Blacks 
tofietherness. which we have so vividly 
ignored for three hundred years. 

"I grant you It wasn't as organized 
a.1 the Republican or Democratic con- 
ventions, but you have to keep this In 
. mind, that the first convention the Con- 
stitutional Congress held wasn't very 
well organized cither. Because of this 
being the first National Bbck Convention, 
the delegates were unprepared for a con- 
vention of such magnitude. Secondly, 
wc have shown the world that we are 
interested in the Black man's future in 
this country as well as his future through- 
out the world. The Reverend Jesse 
Jackson's view points on Black awareness 
brought this point out quite clearly I 
thought and nnally what time is It? 
NATION TIME!" 



The theme that ran through the hcarU, 
souls and minds of individuals at the 
convention was Nation time; one could 
feel this In the air see it in the faces and 
hold it in the handshakes. Other facts 
that were brought out are listed below: 

1. The American system does not 
work for the masses of our people, and 
it cannot be made to work without 
radiml fundamental change. 

2. Both Parties have betrayed Blacks. 

3. It is the challenge to consolidate 
and organize our own Black role as 
the vanguard In the struggle for a new 
society. 

I also came away from Gary with the 



College students from all over Indiana 
gathered at Ball Slate University in Mun- 
cie lost weekend to discuss "Movements 
that Move Students." 

Students attending from lU-Putdue 
Regional (Ziimpus were: Pamela J Haines, 
Lori Wood mm. Howell Phoice, Steve 
Fruth, Deanne Smith. Ruth Zuckerman. 
Molaine Fiscus, Kathy Leaear. Pefigy 
Smith and Stephen G. Beckmen. 

At the Saturday luncheon former 
Governor Matthew E. Welsh spoke on 
"Politics, Pressure Groups, and Students 
for Mental Health." He emphasized the 
Importance of developing community 
services tlirough citizen action. In the 
afternoon the collegians broke up Into 
workshops (o discuss a broad range of 
subjects relating to the mental health 
field. 

Dr. Edward Strain, a consulting psy- 



chologist from Indianapolis, talked with 
students about careers in mental health. 
The Rev. Gary Edwards of the Christian 
Student Foundation. Muncle, discussed 
'The Jesus Movement" with other stu- 
dents. An "awareness group" was led 
by Dr. Judith Vogt of Ball State. Other 
subjects included alcoholism, homosexu- 
ality, and death and aging. 

The conference also provided the stu- 
dents an opportunity to share experi- 
ences they had had while working with 
mental patients in slate hospitals and 
nursing homes. 

Mike Necsc and Vicki Kring of Bail 
Slate were co-chairmen of the two-day 
conference sponsored by Manasa, the 
college program of the Mental Health 
Association in Indiana. Jack Stincn- 
comb of Purdue is the State General 
Chairman of Manasa.

QRECORD REVIEW: 
lONATHON EDWARDS 




Jonathon Edwards 

Jonathan Edwards started singing on 
his own over a year ago, after a stint 
with a bond called Sugar Creek, whose 
only distinction was recording on the 
same label as Bobby Sherman. But 
ever since "Sunshine" became a hit 
single, things have been looking up for 
Jon. And things will look evpn better 
if his first album is any indication. 



Featuring a voice that sounds more 
like Steve Stills than Steve StilU docs 
any more, Edwords has come up with 
a very impressive initial effort. "Sun- 
shine" is the song used to promote sales 
by putting its name on the tittle round 
sticker on the album cover. Butl 
bought the album only after hearing 
two of its other cuts, "Shanty," and 
"Athens County." These two songs, 
along with "Train of Glory," give 
Jonathan a chance to display his prow- 
ess with a harmonica, an ability be re- 
lies heavily on in this album. Guaran- 
teed to lift your spirits and start your 
feet tapping is "Everybody Knows Her." 
"Emma" Is a love song with a haunting 
melody. There are seven other tunes 
on the record, all of which have folk 
or gospel influences. 

The effect of this album on the 
listener is summed up in a line from 
"Shanty;" "Gonna lay around the 
shanty, mamma, and put a good buzz 
on..." Which Is just what youll want 
to do after hearing it. t DAVE HILL

-Presidential hopefuls campaign here^ 



Ashbrook airs 
views in city 

Congressman John Ashbrook, eonsct- 
vativc-Kepublican challenger o( Richard 
Nixon for tho Presidency, was in Fori 
Wayne last Saturday to do some pre- 
liminary campaigning Tor the May 2 
Indiana primary. He also received a 
plaque Trom a group representing M* 
Political Awareness Wech. which wilt be 
held April 21-28 on campus. 

During a news confcienc* at Baer 
Field, Ashbrook stated that he, llhe many 
other Republicans, had become dis- 
appointed with the present lett-ward 
drift of the Nixon administration and 
felt that his candidacy would offer the 
people a chance lo show their disen- 
chantment with Nixon. 

Citing Nixon's many broken campaign 
promises of 1968, Ashbrook concluded 
that he had taken the place of the 1968 
Nixon while Nixon had become the same 
type of President that Hubert Humphrey 
would have made. 

After the news conference, a group of 
students and administrators presented 
Ashbrook with a plaque in appreciation 
for his concern about the newly enfroo' 
chlsed, 280,000 18-20 year-old voters. 
Presenting the plaque were Dean John 
Ulmer, Sandi Jones. Hike Pfundslein, 
and John Mann. 

In accepting the plaque. Ashbrook 
pointed out tliat many of his supporters 
came from the younger voters and that 
he was very encouraged by the involve- 
ment of the youth in the political 
campaign. 

Aslibrook also promised to return to 
the Indiana- Purdue campu.-i during Poli- 
tical Awareness week In order to spend 
more time meeting and speaking with 
students. 

'Androcles' ends 
today at 4'. 30 

Purdue-Indiana Theatre cordially in- 
vites all campus staff and students, and 
their children to attend "Androcles and 
the Lion," a children's show, presented 
by the Children's Theatre Class at Pur- 
due University under the direction of 
Larry Life at the Indiana-Purdue Region- 
al Campus in Fort Wayne. 

The play, performed with music in 
the style of Commedia deli' Arte, which 
was first performed at the Forty-first 
Street Theatre In New York Cit&gt;'. takes 
place in sixteenth century Italy. 

Commcdiadeir Arte is stylized, de- 
pending on the skill and Inventiveness 
of the actors, and is easily comprehen- 
sible to children starting at four years of 
age. 

"Androcles and the Lion" is a favorite 
tale which tells how friends are won by 
kindnc^ that no Pian has a right to own 
another, and that misers and braggarts 
eventually always become undone. 

The children's show has been per- 
formed at Purdue-Indiana Theatre dur- 
ing the past week daily at 4:30 p.m. 
The last performance will be given this 
afternoon. Tickets are 51-00 for gener- 
al public and are free to activity card 
holders.

on tour to the elemenlar&gt;' schools. Fur- 
ther information may be obtained by

monsters of communism wherever they 
rear their ugly heads. Out of the myths 
of America's mass culture^uperman. 
Batman, the supeiheroes of comic boohs- 
director William Klein has fashioned a 
devastating satire of "Silent Majority" 
America that can be viewed as a poli- 
tical poster as much as a fiamboyant 
pop cartoon.

Promises, promises 



An unusual thing has happened tbis 
year. The elected ABC pany has kept 
thett promises made during the Etjdent 
government campalp. What a funny way 
for pohtldans to behave. Why did they 
dolt? 

Student Senator Ron Greek Is kind of 
a symbol of [he ABC reign. Ron is what 
one might call a mixed up hippie. He 
has long flowing hair and is majoring In 
chemistry. Last fall Ron worked for 
Democrat Jlmmle Sticr for City Council, 
which, since Ron plays trombone In the 
university )a7.7. band, one wonders 
whether the reason is because he agreed 
with Slier or because Slier used to be a 
bandleader. 

Treasurer Dave James Is another ABC 
stalwart, when his wife lets him be. 
Dave is best noted for his brown paper 
bag, which he keeps hWden In the De- 
partment of Treasury file. It conceals 
his oversized Pepsi bottle. 

Greek and James are just ordinary stu- 
dents, who happen to be handling the 
bulk of your $80,000 activity fee funds 
and representing your interests. With 
the exception of Indiana- Purdue's num- 
ber one politician, President Mark Franke. 
the whole in&lt;rowd are at best infants in 
the political arena. Little did they know 
that promises are made to be broken. 

Senate leaders Dick Eckert and Brock 
Able have taken their jobs seriously. 
They hawli the funds and refuse to be 
bullied, They have broken the era of the 
"Silent Senate." 

The student government is held 
accountable for more than just the Stu- 
dent Senate. A student government must 
see that everything flows smoothly. The 
success of PIT or the quality of the news- 
paper, though dependent upon variables 
other than student government, will be 
ultimately blamed upon the student gov- 
ernment If thoy fall. The fine offerings

most visible clement of student govern -

credible politital conglomeration. When 
John Altewgt and I get on the same com- 
mittee, there is bound to be fireworks. 
Energetic Stan Jones and promotion- 
minded John Mann added enthustam. 
There is also a lady dean, a semi 
straight theatre prof., a Greek and a black. 
Then of course there's the Hgurehead, 
Sharon Gabet, who not only is beauti- 
ful but is a rarity, an intelligent woman. 

Handling over £30,000 and with pro- 
bably the most talented committee in 
Student Government, ABC could prob- 
ably rest on the laurels of the Convo- 
cations program alone. Of course. It's 
only the most visible part of the ABC 
triumph. It's the tip of the iceberg. 

Some political hacks, bitter because 
they don't have the power to use for 
personal gain, are and will be building 
the "Big Lie", for their attempted take- 
over in the upcoming elections. ABC Is 
an alliance of typical kids, trying to do 
what they feel Is best. 

I have my gripes with the incumbents. 
In fact, last spring I worked my head off 
to beat them. But with the large sums of 
money involved and the experience re- 
quired to defend student Interests, you 
can't afford not to vote ABC.

Mr. Doxsee was a Deputy Attorney 
General for the state from 1967 until 
1969. While serving in this position he 
was the Attorney General's personal lia- 
ison officer to the state legislature. Mr. 
Doxsee In commenting on the last three 
sessions of the state legislature aid 
'The Republican leadership has acted 
like a bunch of undisciplined school 
boys. They had no legislative program 
and accomplished nothing. It seems that 
the only thing they were good at was 
picking up their pay checks." 

"They completely failed to enact a 
promised tax reform and then voted to 
keep the license bureau in politics. After 
the Allen County experience with poli- 
tically run license branches it is appalling 
to think that a majority of Allen County 
Republican representatives either voted 
to keep the branches under political 
control or did not vote on the issue at 
all, which had the same effect." 

Mr. Doxsee is a native of Fort Wayne. 
He graduated from the Indiana Univer- 
sity School of Law in 1963 with a Doc- 
tor of Jurisprudence degree. He also 
did his undergraduate work at Indiana 
University completing his first two 
years at the Fort Wayne regional campus. 
He te a member of the national, state 
and county bar associaltons and is ad- 
mitted to practice before the Supreme 
Court of the United States. 

In 1966 Mr. Doxsee was the Demo- 
cratic candidate for Judge of the Superior 
(kiurt of Allen County and Is presently 
the president of the Democratic Luncheon 
Club.

Toumey-bound Sauers won again, 
but one might justly ask, who did they 
beat? Their last regular season victim 
wasGrlmom. 

Grissom won the race for last plac« 
in Division I going away. No team 
could not match them inability. The'u- 
record was a perfectly lousy 0-10. 

Like most cellar dwellers. Grissom 
was out to have a semi-good time. Team 
standouts included guys like Mike 
Grissom. Mike wasalwaysred-faced 
and sweating within seconds after the 
opening tip-off. Dependable, he could 
always be counted on for a basket or 

Randy Bolenbaugh was one of Grls- 
som's more noted players. Though he 
earned the league's number one foul rep- 
utation early In the year , he worked on 
his speciality until he set a record-one 
game he fouled out with five minutes to 
go In the fust half. 

Dave Reidy was a top scorer on the 
team. Typical of the exciting personali- 
ties on the team, Dave drinks and worked 
for a Kennedy once. 

Powerful Sauers didn't play a parti- 
cularly good game, winning only 61-51. 

The Division II tournament slots 
were finalized in exciting games Troxel 
defeated the hapless Barnyard Trotters 
76-29, meaning that the last two games 
of the regular season would determine 
the play-off contenders. 

The dandelions of the Leo Mafia 
needed to defeat House. An up-and- 
down team. House had an up night, but 
couldn't quite accomplish their coup. 
In one of the season's highest scoring 
games, the Maria triumphed 7B-63. 
Steve Bollier, Kim Cress and Tom Sebert 
teamed for an incredible total of 67 

The rianl game was between the Meg's 
Men and the Barnstormers. The once 
cocky Meg's Men were a subdued team. 
Defeata to the Dudes, Troxel and the Leo 
Mafia meant that this game was all-or- 
nothing. 

The Barnstormers were riding high 
with a 9-0 record. After the Posse 
manhandled the Jocks, the Barnstormers 
became the league's only unbeaten 
squad. That record they wanted to pre- 

After a lousy first half, the game pick- 
ed up. Down 22-14 midway, the Meg's 
Men came back a flred-up team. Tim 
Laughlln lead a hot-shooting charge 
which nearly overcame the classy Barn- 
stormers, 

However, the super-guards combined 
with the skyscrapers to pull the game 
out. MikeTeagardenand Bill Beard 
came through with dutch baskets, but 
It was Jim McCarron who hit a long, 
bhndshotwithlOsecondsleft. It's tough 
to call the winning basket a dumb 
shot ended the hopes of the gallant Meg's 
Men, and left spectator Dave Troxel 



Androcles and 
the Lion 




grinning from ear to ear. 

Meg's Men coach SUve Ottenwciler 
commented, when his team was 4-0, that 
he wouldn't really know how tough they 
were until they met stiffer competition. 
Steve learned that while things may look 
rosle, one shouldn't count his roses be- 
fore they're hatched.
