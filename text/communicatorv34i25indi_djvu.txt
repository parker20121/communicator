Few care 
about IU 
tuition 
dialogue 



As the school year closes dis- 

increases is gaining importance. 
Indiana University held a first- 
ever open forum on this topic on 
Tuesday, March 23. 

Held from the IUPUI campus, 
the President of Indiana 
University, the trustees of the 
University and the governor of 
Indiana were a few of the members 
present at this discussion. Branch 
campuses of the Indiana 
University system were connected 
via satellite to Indianapolis. 

Though IPFW is governed by 
Purdue University, the branch 
campus was also invited via satel- 
lite connection to participate in the 
discussion, though none of the 
proposals or planned increases 
planned will affect IPFW. 

Adam Herbert, President of 
Indiana University, provided 
opening remarks. Judy Palmer, IU

Wartell 
chats of 
campus 
future 



In his latest Chancellor Ch.it, 
IPFW Chancellor Michael Wartell 
was asked about athletic confer- 
ences, college bookstores and cam- 
pus food choices. 

A handful of students met 
with Wartell on Wednesday, March 
24. Chancellor Chats have been 
developed to give IPFW students a 
chance to speak with Wartell about 
their concerns for any part of uni- 
versity life.

idea ol IPFW sports suing into ath- 
letic conferences. He indicated the 
school is slowly maneuvering 
toward a goal of having all the 
sports into one conference. Right 
now, the MAC is one of the major 
conferences with which IPFW may 

A question also risen was 
IPFW eventually having a football 

team. Wartell began by explaining 
why the school has no football - 
partly due to the fact there are no 
facilities and partly because of 
gender equity. 

He said because of gender 
equity, if the school had a football 
program, the only male teams on 
campus would be that, volleyball 
and basketball. Either that or the 
campus would have to establish 
about a dozen women's sports to 
meet standard gender equity

Miss Gay IPFW 
decided Sunday 



It was a night for showcasing 
beauty, talent and tucking back. 

The Sixth Annual Miss Gay 
IPFW was a success with competi- 
tors and the community, accord- 
ing to organizers. Four individu- 
als donning high heels and dis- 
playing their varied talents vied 
for the title of Miss Gay IPFW 2004 
Sunday at the Walb Ballroom. 

"The judges h,id a gc"&gt;d time, 
so did the audience. We had a 
really good turnout, so we're real- 
ly happy with that," Jeff sterling ol 
EREN said. 

Sterling noted it is important 
to see the local gay community 
establish extravagant shows and 
fundraisers for gatherings of peo- 
ple like those already mainstays at 
larger universities and cities. 

"It proves this organization 
can put together a bigger event - 
like a larger campus ... like IU in 
Bloomington," he said. 

For the first time, a transsex- 
ual won the competition. Leslie 
Ryan said she was happy she had 
an opportunity to compete and 
thrilled with her victory. 

"I was nervous," she admit- 
ted as she listened to the final 
judgements made. She won the 
interview portion of the event, 
while Brittany Monroe won the

A concern of Follett's 
Bookstore prices was brought forth 

during the session I h* noted book- 
stores work on a fairly narrow 
margin - and the only way to con- 
trol prices is lo have competition 

Currently in Fort Wayne, the 
only competition to Follett's is The 
Bookmark on North Anthony 
Boulevard. He also commented it 
is fairly common to have one book- 
store on campus for a university 
the size of IPFW. 

Follett's itself may eventually 
be on the move, he noted. 

IPFW is looking at ways to 
connect physically Helmke 
Library, Walb Student Union and 
Gates Center. Follett's may be relo- 
cated into Walb to pull student 
traffic toward the Union more 
often toward what officials see as 
the center of campus. 

Another concern was selling 
food lor fundraising on campus, 
and the suggestion of using the 
kitchen m Walb Student Union. 
Warlell said he had never consid- 
ered having student groups use 
the cafeteria facilities to prepare 
food. He felt it would be worth a 
try as a good idea but was not sure 
if it would work. 

Even with that idea on the 
table, he said there were no plans 
to bring back cafeteria-style serv- 
ing lo campus. There arc discus- 
sions underway looking at possi- 
bly bringing a different fast food 
restaurant to IPFW to give an 
expanded variety, and he men- 
tioned Ritter's Frozen Custard 
may bring a store onto campus.

and design. And with Williams' 
history with various cultures in his 
work, this mural was guaranteed 
to have a wide range ot symbolic 
expression. 

"We have Native American art 
represenled, African art, the art of 
singing and music and a host of 
other symbols that kind of speak to 
other aspects of creativity." said 
Williams. 

Williams' initial ideals for 
diversity and culture in his work 
came growing up with interests in 
African American cowboys and the 




vice president and chief financial 
officer, then gave a presentation on 
the budget problems facing 
Indiana University and the 
President's recommendations to 
the Board of Trustees. 

"We don't want to raise your 
costs but we also don't want to 
compromise excellence," read one 
slide. 

The process of determining 
tuition increases included "months 
o( planning" and is a "most difficult 
decision" and a "delicate balance" 
according to Palmer. 

Palmer listed several factors 
contribuling lo budget complica- 
tions, including "unavoidable 
costs, outside mandates (such as 
regulatory compliance), inflation 
(and) competition for faculty." 

Palmer drew a comparison 
between the challenges facing the 
University and the challenges fac- 
ing the typical American house- 
hold 

"Inflation is a factor on our 
budget — just like a household 
budget," said Palmer. 

In addition, a greater number 
of students have started to attend 
Indiana University in recent years. 
This is "an indication of the value 
students place in (an) IU educa- 
tion." said Palmer. 

"We do more with less," she 

Indiana University ranks in 
the bottom of Big Ten state appro- 
priations. It ranks 7 out of 11 
among its peers in professor salary 
The generated revenue from the 
university also ranked near the 
bottom. 

The general increase for all 
campuses is four percent, a guide- 
line suggested In Governor Joseph 
Kernan. Indiana University decid- 
ed to abide by this suggestion from 
the governor. 

For Bloomington, this means 
that FTE students enrolled before 
spring 2003 will see a $189.60 

of $30.00 in mandatory fees. 
Students enrolled after spring 2003 
will see a $229.60 increase in 
tuition and also a $30 00 increase in 
mandatory fees. 

Non-resident and internation- 
al students will see a six percenl 
increase in tuition. Graduate and 
professional students will see a 
four percent increase for residents 
and a "program specific" increase 
for non-residents, said Palmer.

as students work on a mural 
project Thursday at IPFW. 

American West. He has even 
added to his historical recollections 
an on going series ol large portrait-. 
featuring cowboys, Buffalo sol- 
diers, and civil war soldiers. 

"I have always been very 
interested in portraits, especially 
large heads and figures. The work 
of realist artists like Jack Beal, 
Alfred Leslie, and Chuck Close 
have been very influential," said 
Williams. 

The mural, completed in an 
entire day on the second floor of 
Walb Union, attracted many 
onlookers, some who simply 
stopped to view for moments or 
even sit and view the work. 



Clapacs then presented the "new 
fee for IU Bloomington" lo help 
correct the "structural problem in 
funding IU Athletics," he said. 

IU ranks near the bottom of 
the Big Ten in funding (only 
Northwestern University ranks 
lower) and receives no institutional 
support with 24 sports programs 
and a $34 million dollar budget. In 
contrast, Ohio State also receives 
no institutional support but has 
$87 million dollars in funding with 
34 sports programs. 

Indiana University has recent- 
ly added more women's sports to 
comply with "the spirit of Title IX," 
said Clapacs. Indiana University 
has 13 female sports and 11 male 

"Rather than do roster man- 
agement" the University decided lo 
add more female sports, more 
female scholarships and i2 million 
dollars for these sports. 

In addition, during basketball 
season the students have 45 per- 
cent of Assembly Hall, thus buving 
tickets at a cheaper price. 

Rather than cut men's teams 
or sell student seats to other 
patrons, a $15 dollar student 
Athletic fee for each student was 
proposed to help cover these 

Kernan ajso spoke at the 
meeting and thanked the board tor 
the "very, very difficult decisions 
that have been made" concerning 
the budget. He also recognised the 
difficult time for families and the 
increasing costs of higher educa- 
tion. In addition, the governor rec- 
ognized the university's high rate 
of incoming freshmen and the need 
to have the students "stay here in 
state after they graduate," he said. 

After the prepared remarks 
the campuses were open for ques- 
tions, though very few questions 

On the IPFW campus, no one 
attended the meeting other than 
members of the press and Walter ' 
Branson, Vice Chancellor of 
Financial Affairs in KT G22. 

"We wanted to make this 
(forum) available," said Branson, 
for students and for families of stu- 
dents who attend Bloomington. He 
was not surprised by the zero 
turnout, though he expects the 
April K meeting lor the Purdue sys- 
tem to generate much more inter- 
Branson also expects to see 
more of the open forums from col- 
leges and universities "all around 
the state this year." he said. 



Purdue to hold public

According to university offi- 
cials, the Finance Committee of the 
Trustees of Purdue University will 
hear comments from the public on 
a proposed four percent increase in 
tution and mandatory tees charged

IPFW Alumni officials are encouraging the Class of 2004 to join in 
the Alumni Millennium Brick Walk •- and are giving current seniors a 
discount to help out. 

Normally, the named bricks cost $50. Right now, the Class of '04 
can purchase one for $25. Seniors who have been well educated in their 
college years would be able to easily figure out, that's half off. 

The Alumni Millennium Brick Walk is a path of thousands of 
bricks located off South Campus Drive heading towards the IPFW sign 
on Coliseum Boulevard. 

Anyone interested in being a part of the IPFW legacy - and dis- 
playing that legacy in stone — can stop by Kettler Hall rooms 140 or 142 
between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. on weekdays, or they can apply online at the 
websitewww.ipfw.edu/commence/class_gift. 

More information can be gathered by contacting Alumni Relations 
at 481-6807.

Unconstitutionality 



On June 14, 1942, Congress approved the following version of the Pledge of 
Allegiance: I pledge allegiance to the flag of Ihe Untied Slates ol America, and to the 
Republic, for which it stands, one Nation indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for all. 
On June 14 1 , 1954, Congress added the words "Under God" to the pledge, claiming 
that the addition was made "to recognize a Supreme Being" and support religion 
during the Cold War, a time "when the government was publicly inveighing against 
atheistic communism." In laymen's terms, the true motivation was to separate the 
American public from the "godless heathens" in Russia. This addition to the Pledge 
borders on, if not crosses the line into, unconstitutionality. The statement from 
Congress confirms that the addition was an attempt 10 assert that those citizens who 
did not believe in Cod were not "real' Americans, which is obviously not true. 

The addition to the Pledge came during a time of tense international politics and 
religious revival thai spread throughout the country as surely as the Red Scare. In 
1955, shortly after the 'Under God insertion. Congress added, "In God We Trust" 
to all American currency. The obvious point of all these changes was to promote 
religion among Americans and separate them, the good. Cod tearing citizens, from 
"atheistic communism." Most current politicians use a different reason to support 
keeping "Under God" in the Pledge voicing the opinion that the Founding Fathers 
were Christian, and they surely intended for America to be a Christian country. 

This idea that the Founding Fathers, when they established the separation of 
church and state, meant that all religions should he separate except for Christianity, 
is a common misconception. The Founding Fathers were the children of pilgrims 
fleeing religious persecution by Christians to other Christians, and they specifically 
included the separation clause to include ALL religions, not just those they did not 
believe in. Recently a judge in Alabama was ordered b\ The Supreme Court t'o take 
down plaques in his courthouse that bore The Ten Commandments: how is the 
insertion of "Under Cod" any different from publn.lv displaying Christian beliefs 
on publicly owned property - an establishment of the law and government, no less? 
These two words, while seemmgh insignificant, exclude at least five percent of the 
American population Irom being real" Americans Where is it written that in order 
to be patriotic, one must be L hristian as well? Is a belief in Jesus Christ necessary to 
love America and all the freedoms therein? 

The most recent litigation to attempt to remove "Under God" came in 2002, when 
Michael Newdow's daughter was forced to say the Pledge of Allegiance in school, 
a fact which upset hei a the is 1 father to the point of litigation. Newdow, a lawyer and 
doctor from California, brought his ease before a court and eventually ended up 
before the 9 tn Circuit Court of Appeals, who ruled that the Pledge was unconstitu- 
tional. However, due to the enormous backlash of anger and hatred from the pub- 
lic. Judge Alfred Goodwin suspended his ruling until all his fellow 9 ,n Circuit Court 
judges could review the case. Why was Goodwin attacked? Perhaps because the 
majority of the American population is Christian and felt that they were being 
attacked in the first place. Again, this is another misconception: Newdow was fight- 
ing to protect the righl of every American to hold, unimpeded, whatever views they 
like on religion. Newdow was not attacking Christians so much as trying to make 
this country live up to the standards set forth bv its creators. Perhaps Christians, 
known for their zealous preaching of love and acceptance, can see his 



intentions are hon 



able

Lions, Republicans, and Bears: 
Oh my! 



These past few weeks have been 
wonderful, and 1 would love to 
write a column about how every- 
one is going to be all right, and 
things are looking up (1 still believe 
that, by the way); but there is a 
pressing concern that demands the 
entirety of my attention for this 
week's column. One of my greatest 
flaws was recently exposed during 
a late-night coffee with my friends, 
and now 1 must also expose this 
failing to the world (or the IPFW 
campus). It is a flaw so egregious 
that it is nearly unforgivable. I 
should be cast out as a pariah and 
banned from IPFW. 

Why should this punishment be 
heaped upon my head' 1 hesitate to 
tell you, gentle readers, as it is 
indeed a terrible flaw: I am a 
Republican sympathizer. In fact, 
though I am not myself a 
Republican, I like a lot of the 
Republican platform stances. I 
don't think that Republicans are 
intent on destroying the world, nor 
do I think the members of the 
Republican horde in Congress are 
going to go to Alaska to kill each 
and every animal there and then 
steal the oil for their giant earth- 
killing SUVs. And 1 even think that 
sometimes the media gives 
Republicans a harder time than the 
Democrats. 

This soft-spot for tax-cuts is a 
secret that I have kept with me all 
throughout my time on campus. I 



hesitate to tell new people that 1 
meet about my inclination-. 
because on more than on occasion, 
it has resulted in judgmental looks. 

"Oh," he or she might say. While 
he or she might not voice the next 
thought, it still remains: "You're 
part of the problem." 

If it is an opponent in the class- 
room, we can (hopefully) agree to 
disagree and move on. I never 
realized, however, that even with 
my own friends great trouble can 
result from adding politics to the 
conversation. On the late night cof- 
fee I previously mentioned, 1 
brought up my computer problems 
in my internet classes, and I talked 
about the paper I had written for 
one of those classes (about firearms 
control) that in part advocated the 
benefits of intelligently-designed 
concealed carry laws. 

First of all, I thought, I brought it 
up mostly as an excuse to compla 



,this 

stupidity because the friends that I 
was with that night ranged from 
moderately to very liberal — there 
was naiy a right-leaning person in 
the place (other than the bour- 
■ exploiting the work- 



i,ofc 



Instead of just a passing com- 
ment, a rather heated debate 
ensued because neither side would 
capitulate. Finally, the debate 
ended with the prevailing opinion 
that I am a fascist mtenl on world homework 
domination (for good measure I 



threw back a couple of "Commie" 
comments). As for myself, 1 
thought it was a good debate, the 
whole thing worth nothing more 
than a couple of (pointless) opin- 
ions — and 1 could really use anoth- 
er cup of coffee. 

I suppose I simply cannot under- 
stand what it is to have political 
beliefs so deeply ingrained that 
even to question them would be a 
questioning of your very character. 
I don't march in demonstrations, I 
don't volunteer my time to a local 
political organization — I go to 
work, I go to school, and if I am 
lucky I am home before 7:00 pm 
most nights. 

1 agree with the Republican 
stances (or Democratic issues, for 
that matter) because that is what I 
have seen will work best given my 
experience and logic I'm not look- 
ing to save the world or create 
some great global change. I look at 
my friends who believe that they 
are part of some great worldwide 
movement, and then I (quietly) 
laugh and gel back to my home- 

My opinions today may lean 

slightly lo the right— but as I said, 
they are based partially on experi- 
ence, and thus tomorrow I may 
find out that John Kerr)' was right 
after all... Even though today that 
seems impossible, I'm trying to 
stay open to ideas. 

If that makes me part of the prob- 
lem, then grab your protest signs 
and go for it. I'll be doing my

parts of camp that don't fit into the 
generic slacker stereotype of the 
hippie counselor. 

It's hard to define the job of a 
counselor. A counselor is a strange 
combination of doctor, lawyer, 
actor, song leader, and an under- 
paid babysitter. They are expected 
to understand any childhood prob- 
lem that may arise and find its 
cure; they are the ones that are 
expected to be a hand to hold in 
times of fear and to be ever watch- 
ful for poison ivy along the trail. 
They can be relied upon to patch 
up broken friendships, bloody

In more concrete terms, camp 
work isn't for everyone, but some 
of the more obvious qualities exis- 
tent in camp staff are: appreciation 
for people, sense of humor; youth- 
ful yet mature, love of the out- 
doors, appreciation for new experi- 
ences, flexibility in routines, quick 



thinking, resourceful, empathy, 
and persistence to get the job done. 

Granted, you're not going to 
make millions working at camp. If 
you did, I'd not even be here writ- 
ing this column, I'd be on my yacht 
somewhere in the Caribbean. They 
weren 't kidding when it's 
remarked that you earn the same 
as an underpaid babysitter. The 
average salary for a camp coun- 
selor is approximately $100-5200 a 
week, depending on certifications 
and experience. Upper level staff, 
such as waterfront, lifeguards, arts 
and crafts, program, tripping, 
canoeing, and sports directors will 
earn $150-$350, once again 
depending on age, certifications, 
and experience. However, keep in 
mind that what you're paid in your 
paycheck doesn't include what 
you're going to be making through 
other means. Some camps will pay 
for you to be certified and earn 
your license in different areas: First 
Aid, CPR, life guarding, archery, 
ropes, small-craft, and professional 
rescuer, and these certifications 
aren't cheap. Some camps will give 
you completion bonuses, for com- 
pleting the entire summer. Most, if 
not all, residential camps include 
room, laundry, and food in your 
pay, so you are getting fed all sum- 
mer without having to pay for it. 
Most camps offer you use of the 
camp equipment on time off, so on 
your days, nights and weekends 
off, you can use the canoes, go 
swimming, do some archery, or 
just relax and enjoy some peace 
and quiet. 

If including all of that doesn't 
make you happy, there's always 
this: with gas prices breaking 
records everyday, just think of it as 
three months without having to fill 
up your tank. 

I've made some of the best 
friends I'll have in my entire life 
through my experience at camp. 
People from around the country 
and around the world have a spe- 
cial place in my life and in my heart 
due to those two months 1 spent in 
the woods. Camp is a bonding 
experience like no other, because 
few people can understand what 
living at camp for the summer is 
like. These are the people you 
know you could count on to help 
you out, even if it means getting a 
little dirty in the process. 

Last summer was my first year 
at camp, and 1 didn't know what 
I'd find. I went down to Kentucky 
to work at a Girl Scout camp, and I 
had some interesting expectations, 
and I can say that last summer 
exceeded all expectations that I 



ever had. I had more fun, and 
made more memories, and learned 
more last summer than I had in a 
long time. I learned just as much 
from my campers in my units as I 
did from the other staff members. 
The girls in my unit were each so 
unique and so funny that they'd 
often have me almost in tears 
laughing from something they'd 
said or done. Through their inno- 
cent viewpoint on life, I've learned 
some of my most treasured lessons. 
For example, "No 



below MY belt are my knees' 
last but not least, "I can't change 
the way God made me." When I 
thought I could give no more, and 
was running on E, the girls in my 
unit helped me find energy and 
strength that I didn't even realize I 
had. I helped girls try new foods, 
learn new games, explore more in 
the world around them, and over- 
come some of their biggest fears 
I've learned that sometimes the 
biggest problems have the smallest 
solutions, and that just because 
you're dealing with a child, doesn't 
mean that they are ignorant. I real- 
ize that I know a lot more ignorant 
adults than children, and that the 
best way to learn about a person is 
to spend a week in the woods with 
them, limited electricity and latrine 

This summer, I have been given 
the opportunity to be the arts and 
crafts instructor at another Girl 
Scout camp up in Michigan, and 
nothing could make me happier. 
With every day that gets warmer, 
my thoughts turn to campfires and 
marshmallows, to hiking trails and 
platform tents, to paint and glitter, 
to canoeing and swimming, to 
quiet sunrises And colorful sunsets. 

lessons learned than I could ever 
imagine. 

Summers come and summers 
go, but when you're there all sum- 
mer long, there is a part of you that 
changes forever. There are things 
that will always trigger thoughts ,.| 
camp: campfires, fireflies, popsi- 
cles, the sound of laughing chil- 
dren, the smell of bug spray and 
suntan lotion, the sound of the 
birds in the morning and the crick- 
ets at night, and every clear, star- 
filled night- 
There are still camps hiring for 
this summer, so if you're interest- 
ed, you should get online and 
check it out. There's a camp home 
for you out there, all you have to 
do is look. 



The meaning of life: 

Let the good times roll 



my life. I met someone the other 
day and chatted with this person, 
and they opened my eyes greatly 



What better things are there 
than Joe Walsh and Pabst Blue

tiful weekend? The two greatest proved

that you feel like a rock star after 
going out, getting your groove on 
with the ladies or guys, if that is 
the way your taste is, and having 
an overly successful social night.

most expensive of brews on the

Joe Walsh did a song called 
"Life's Been Good" and it makes 
you do one thing you never want 
to do under the influence of any- 
thing for any matter: evaluate your 
life. The past times I have evaluat- 
ed my life were after my open- 
heart surgery, a horrible break-up, 
the day I lost my virginity... etc. For 
anyone who has either gone 
through one of those kinds of 
events, it's not the most mentally 
"right" time to do that. You usual- 
ly end up piercing something on 
your body pointlessly or making 
such a drastic change that even 
your own family members would 
say, as .Freud would, "He has

the mood to ponder my own exis- 
tence up until now. As I look back 
at my life, I do also agree with Joe 
in saying that life has been good to 
me so far. I have experienced a lot 
more than most people, learned 
most of life's valuable lessons by 
experiencing them young. When I 
was 14 I had open heart surgery 
and died. Yes, died. It made me 
value life a lot more than some 
people might. My senior year of 
high school, I tell head-over for the 
wrong woman and ended up get- 
ting pooped on. Taught me that 
love, even though it exists, can be 
blinded by the light. See, it could 
be worse. A Budweiser truck could 
have hit me on my way to school 
today, with everyone gossiping, "It 
was the Mr. Boo/e that killed Jim." 
Aside from the things that have 
happened TO me, I think about the 
other things in my life. I have a 
gaggle of friends whom I hold dear 
more than anything, I have a lov- 
ing family, a job, a line of e red it .\nd 

looking me in the eves. I am cruis- 
ing the dating scene like any twen- 
ty-sumething would and am enjoy- 
ing the single life and its freedoms. 
In short, I don't feel that I can ask 
for more out of my life right now. I 
mean, who can? Let's look al the 
facts. Those of vou who are reading 
this drivel are in college for some 
reason, so what if it isn't 
Bloomington or Berkeley? At least 
we're doing something with our 
lives folks. See, life's been good to 



not all people are how a category 
of them act. Let me paint you an 
example using myself. I'm Irish, 

Irish people have three basic 
things attached to them: drinking, 
fighting and potatoes. There are 
other things that ride in on the 
coat-tails of the three others; 
whiskey, U2, Cops. ...etc. But those 
other three: drinking, fighting .uid 
potatoes are the ones that I always 
pick up. Granted, I do drink, I 
sometimes fight and I like pota- 
toes, but that doesn't sum up the 
entire country of Ireland. In this 
stereotype, I ran through a few of 
my own and came to the conclu- 
sion that 1 am one judgmental 
S.O.B. It's a bad thing. In that way, 
life hasn't been good to me. It's a 
great feeling to be proved wrong 
and corrected in a nice way. To be 
shown the error of your ways and 
still have an entire life to correct 
things. Still have time to clean up 
your act, go to church and pay 
your parking tickets. Don't you 
like that feeling? It's a brutal sense 
of freedom that some people don't 
ever really get to feel, for a number 
of reasons: A late night in a random 
bed, with a random person that 
culminates in a time-bomb going 
off nine months later; an even later 
night after a hard night of drinking 
that lands them in the arms of a 
large man named Bertha who 
wears women's clothing and likes 
show tunes at the downtown lock- 
up. 

Catch my drift? There are a lot 
of ways that our lives could be hor- 
ribly worse. Bruce Springsteen 
once said "It ain't no sin lo he glad 
you're alive," and I think Brucellas 
a huge point. Life is a celebration. 
It's a party. It's one swirling vortex 
of moments that culminate in God 
asking us the immortal question 
"What's the meaning of life?" But 
when you are asked that, what are 
vou going to say? 

Of everything I've dealt with, I 
wouldn't change any of it for any- 
thing. They've made me the man I 
am today. As I imagine that ifs 
been good to a lot of other people 
out there, make sure you build 
upon it. Expand your horizons and 
take a chance. Go to a place you've 
never been, talk to the crackhead 
down the street, get in a fight or 
challenge someone to a friendly 
game of Yat/ee. We're college stu- 
dents, and we can do anything we 
want. It's a wonderful feeling to he 
free, and this is our time to stretch 
our wings, shake some hands and 
make some crap happen. Go out 
and have fun, go out and party, 
meet people and don't come home

sizes. In his more serious films (well, as 
serious as someone can be when they rely 
on "37" as an ongoing punchline), he's dealt 
with the drudgery of work ("Clerks"), sexu- 
ality ("Chasing Amy"), and religion 
("Dogma") 

This time out, it's a story about father- 
hood - and from the toned-down language, 
he takes this topic more seriously than his 
fans might want. 

Ollie Trinke (Ben Affleck) is a music 
publicist who loves his job - and although 
he tries to love his wife and her pregnancy 
- it's apparent he will always put his career 
first. That ends al his child's birth and 
wife's death The pressure builds to the

Ernest O'Donnell - who 
first graced View Askew 
films in the role of Rick 
Derris in "Clerks") Smith 
also takes a variety of pot 
shots at pop culture and 
icons (especially Will

classic George Lucas line.

Raquel Castro, the 7-year-old who 
play. 1 iertie Trinke, gives a great perform- 
ance in a film made nearly two years ago. 
She's not quite Haley Joel Osmond from 
"The Sixth Sense," but she brings smiles to 
the movie. 

And she represents in a big way what 
Smith has always tried to show off in small 



not like there's a lot of 
"Chasing Amy" when charac- 
ters are commenting about the reason a 
woman is nicknamed "Finger Cuffs," but 
there is innocence exhibited when the main 
characters are la\ ing in bed discussing their 
relationship or confessing their feelings in 
an SUV. 

Being that he's Kevin Smith, few peo- 
ple will see that. The fact is this is a good 
movie by a great writer. There are some 
flaws in logic, but it is worth a matinee rate 
for the humor and inspired writing.

Thank God for DVD 



ny eye. Perched on its side was a CD-shaped disc called a Digital Videi 
Disc, or DVD for short. I pondered over this foreign object for a few min- 
utes, then went on my way. Little did I know that that was the first 
encounter with a new means of entertain men i that would change my life. 

That single stand grew into two or three during the first few months 
after our introduction Initial feelings over this formal were skeptical. A 
few years earlier laser disc- had caused a mild stir; that is until people 
realized they just looked like records thai were easier to damage. I had 
a buddy named Ken-on who predicted that DVDs were just a fad and 
would fade into obscurity along with their predecessors, laser discs. I 
knew he was crazy then, and I said so, but his obvious lack of sanity is 
more evident today. You would be hardpressed to find someone who 
doesn't own at least one DVD player, and if you do, there's no excuse:- 
Sears has one for S34 ( -urrv tor the shameless plug). As a matter of fact, 
I can't remember the last time I saw anyone buy a VHS. 

Oh yeah, I called them VHS now, on account of my familarity of inti- 
tials'. Also, you can't tell right now, but when I say "VHS" its always spo- 
ken with a scoff, as if to nioik the primitive technology of yesteryear. I 
really do wish I didn't have such a hostile attitude towards the crap that 
is VHS, but it's hard not to despise them when DVDs are so damn cool. 
The other day I was making the rounds at a "DVDs for under $10" stand 
(of which I never leave without one in hand), and I was thinking about 
how I would never get so excited about a VHS of the same price. To 
prove to myself the futility oi the medium, I went over to the new releas- 
es of VHS. Not one over $10, swear to God. And why would there be? 
A VHS doesn't give me the amenitiiies of a DVD. There are no special 



is so-so image quality that deteriorates a tittle everytime you watch i 
Sure, some of them out there will put up a fight by putting deleted scenes 
at the end of the tape in an attempt to say, "Hey, we can do the DVD thing, 
too." But the fact is, they can't. 

Commentary jusl writing that word gives me chills. Commentary is, 
without a doubt, the greatest invention since previews before the feature 
presentation. When else i- it possible h&gt; gain -m h in-ight into a picture 
that you enjoy? Mv first experience with commentary was on "Good Wilt 
Hunting." My cousin and I were going through a huge phase with that 
movie, watching it 50 time- reciting the lines, and even assigning our- 
selves their personalities and character traits (for your information, I was 
Matt and he was Ben). And for the two hours that we sat transfixed in 
front of the television, listening to the commentary by our idols, we felt 
as if we were right there with them. For two hours, we were friends with 
Ben and Matt and it was glorious. 

This feeling continues with the new and innovative ways of presenting 
a commentary track. For an example of such, check out the commentary 
on the Special Edition "Jerry Maguire." Not only do you get to hear 
Cameron Crowe, Tom Cruise, Rene Zellweger, and Cuba Gooding, Jr. talk 
about the film, but you get to watch them watch I hem-elves. It is quite a 
surreal moment With -tar- -o ob-es-ed u ith then image it's funny to see 
them react to each other in an informal environment. If you are a fan of 
this voyeur-commentary, check out "Goonies," they too offer the "Watch 
the Stars Watch "! ttemselves" gimmick. However, I warn you, watching 
Corey Feldman watch himself isn't as cool as Tom Cruise watching him- 
self. 

The depths of the glory that is DVD is not solely confined to films. 
Television has also been blessed by the miracle of a digital video disc. 
Before DVD, how manv people owned an entire series on tape? Not very 
many. If they were released at all, they were big bulky things that were 
more hassle than necessary (navigating through the tapes to find the 
desired episode was pure hell, believe me). Now, entire series of practi- 
cally any successful television show are out on DVD or in the process. 
And what a brilliant idea it is. Not only does it enable you to see every 
epsiode without needing enough structure and organization (not to men- 
tion redundancy) to be in thesame place once a week to see every new 
episode, but it enables \ou to -kip through the bull-hit of television. Take 
for instance, the show "24." Now this show is amazing, but there is no 



So when an episode has lack Bauer near death only to end right when 
he's supposedly about to die, it's okay. What would usually have me 
throwing the remote at the television is no problem on DVD. Now I just 
find the next episode on the main menu and watch till my heart's content. 
It's that simple. 

There is also a. collector's appeal to the world of DVD. There is some- 
thing -acred about holding a DVD you 



with a VHS. This 



mplished 
c-themed 



DVDs, especially The Band's "The Last Waltz" and Bob Dyla 
Look Back." And now with all the TV shows going to the disc, the col- 
lections won't end. So far, I have a few series I will own in their entirety 
as soon as possible: The Office" (Series Two is pre-ordered and I have the 
Christmas Special- hoot legged), "Curb Your Enthusiasm" Season One 
(Season Two is out in June), "King of the Hill" Seasons One and Two 
(Season Three is slated for a Spring release), "Family Guy" (Seasons One, 
Two, and Three) and soon to be "Cheers." I am still contemplating 
whether or not I want to own "Seinfeld" on account of the fact that I have 
seen every episode at least five times each. 

Now, I know there are some tradionalists out there who stick by VHS, 
usually hiding behind excuses like "they're cheaper," or "DVDs skip." 
Well, if that's your reasoning then I can assume you listen to cassette 
tapes as opposed to compact discs, because the same problems arise. If 
you are just worried about what the switch would entail, don't be fright- 
ened, Simply find me and I will slowly ease you into the wonderful 
world that is DVD. I promise, you will not regret it.

some obvious differences between 
drag contests and pageants like 
Miss America and Miss Universe. 

"Those arc for genetic women. 
This is for impersonation. (In Miss 
Gay IPPW), there's a lot more 
glamour, the dresses are bigger, the 
makeup is heavier," she said. 

Officials were pleased with 
the turnout and said with the con- 
tinued interest, there will likely be 
a seventh Miss Gay IPFW about 
one year from now. 

"The people who attend, the 
people who judge, the people who 
perform shows .here's a lot of 
interest for IPFW in the gay corn- 



Recently I judged I he Miss Gay IPFW. It was an 
experience. I wasn't sure what was going to happen, 
so 1 went in with an open mind. I knew whoever won 
should have grace, dignity, mteltigience and manners. 

We started the pageant Saturday with male inter- 
views. I was impressed with how professional they 
handled themselves. 

I was very impressed with Leslie's answers. She 
came to the interview in professional attire and con- 
ducted herself so. She received a perfect vote from all 
six judges. I felt Brittany Monroe could have had some 
better answers, but was impressed with her attire. 
Trinity also looked professional, and if I had to judge 
on appearance, I would have chosen Trinity. 

When 1 judged for the evening wear, 1 felt the 
outfit would be something that I wouldn't mind wear- 



ing Leslie's outfit was gorgeous and definitely some- 
thing I would wear. Mercedee-. bad a gorgeous outfit 
It reminded me of one that I wore in high school to a 
formal dance. 1 feel Mercedees won because she 
looked young and elegant. 

For the talent, anyone could lip sync and dance. 
But, if you could lombme both then you've got your- 
self a winner. I was impressed with the song that 
Leslie chose, "Indianapolis ." lo me, that showed she 
really lines Indiana. I also could tell her heart was into 
it. Not many people think old songs are classics, but 
Monroe did, and boy, did she ha\ e class. Class is what 
made her the winner of the talent competition. 

Pretty much, I thought that Miss Gay IPFW was 
a good show. I felt anyone who could proudly show 
everyone in the world they are happy to be a cross- 
dresser or drag queen, more power to them. 

This competition brings a lot of attention to 
IPFW, and also helps up put our name on the map.

NCAA Tournament: Who will win it all? 



I can openly admit thai my 
bracket was pretty well busted this 
year. Granted, I suppose that 
Louisiana-Lafayette going to the 
Final Four was a bit of a longshot. 
But those Blue Devils &lt;i re still hang- 
ing in there. 

Yes, I must admit. Duke is 
not riding high at all. In fact, they 
barely escaped Xavier and even 
struggled mightily with Illinois in 
the Sweet 1ft. But now they are in 
their domain. It's Final Four time 
and this is where Duke thrives. 

Which brings me to match 
up number one. Duke battling 
Connecticut. The Devils and the 
Huskies. The 2001 vs. 1999 
National Champions. And all of 




obody othi 
than Kentucky was given credit at 
having a chance to knock off Duke. 
And Kentucky is gone, far- 
gone ..courtesy or UAB. How sad. 
Duke is the heavy favorite 
and even if 1 was not a Duke fan, I 
couldn't foresee how U Conn could 
beat Duke. While they have the 
best chance of any person in the 
tournament, they have few threats. 
Emeka Okafor is arguably the best 
player in the NCAA. But inside, 
Duke counters with Sheldon 
Williams, Luol Deng and Shavlik 



Randolph. 

While Duke's perimeter 
shooters get more credit, their 
inside game is hard to top. Their 
one-two punch lias a one-two-three 
punch. U Conn falls by 8. 

Though U Conn not being 
deep in their downfall, it is the 
upside to Georgia Tech. When B) 
Elder went down with a bad ankle

No Cowboys riding 



another victim of what I see to be 
an inevitable AII-ACC final. 

All-ACC? That should 
actually be the name of Duke's bas- 
ketball team. Because four of the 
five regular starters (excluding 
Daniel l:wing) were named to one 
of the three All-ACC teams. 

At 13-3, Duke finished 
with the best conference record, 
but find one of those three losses to 
Georgia Tech by 8. Ten days later, 



Ihev drooped Tech by 14. But that 
is not what will lie on Coach K's 
mind heading towards this one. It 
will be the loss. 

Georgia Tech took that 
game by going against their nor- 
mal season philosophy of "give the 
ball to B.J." and they gave the ball 
to everyone. Elder, lack, 
Schenscher and junior lsma'it 
Muhammad .ill scored in double 
digits, while Duke relied on J.J. 
Redick to lead the way. 

This time will be the 
tiebreaker If it were baseball, it 
would be the bottom of the ninth, 
tied 1-1. And with each team vying 
for bragging rights, I personally 
expect Duhon and Redick to be the 
difference makers as Duke makes il 
number four for Coach K.

'Dons walk-off 
with Beachy's blast 



IPFW's Jenna Beachy is mauled by leammates at home plate after she hit a 
homerun in the bottom of the 7th inning to giv e the Mastodons a 2-1 victory. 



By IPFW News Si 

Jenna Beachy's walk-off home run in 
the 7th inning of game two, helped IPFW lo 
a double-header split with the University of 
Detroit Men v, Thursday in Fort Wayne The 
Mastodons dropped game one 3-1, but won 
I lie nightcap 2-1. 

Beachy said she was not sure if the hall 
was hit hard enough to be a homerun. 

"The first thing thai popped in my 
head was, crap, not an easy pop-up," 
Beachy said. 

The Mastodons led most of game two, 
hut the Titans tied the game in the top of the 
7th, after a double and ,i w ild-pik h brought 
home Anna Ollgaard. 

But, with one out in the bottom hall of 
the frame, Peachy drilled a shot over the left 
field wall, to give the 'Dons the win. 

As the ball carried, Beachy, a sopho- 
more, had one thing on her mind. 

"Keep going," she thought to herself, 
"and hope that a nice bree/e might blow in 
and take it out." 

Senior Mindy Pomeroy got the win, 
going .even innings, giving up one run on 
five hit\ while striking out three. 



In game one, Detroit (7-9) got two runs 
in the second, and one in the third, while 
pounding out 13 hits m their 3-1 win. 

The season has been rough thus far for 
IPFW. Beachy's homeurn gave the 
Mastodons just their third win of the season. 

"I'm glad that it came at such an oppor- 
tune time," she said, "we all wanted that 
win and the fact that we got it made it that 

Despite have momentum from 

Beachy's bat, the Mastodons struggled at 
Purdue in a March 27-28 doubleheader. 

The team managed just one hit in two 
games against the Boilermakers and lost 8-2 
and 2-0. 

Beachy is second on the team's batting 
average with 35b and is the only Mastodon 
to start all 24 games. 

The Mastodons have upcoming road 
games on March 3D at Ioledo and April 1 at 
Wright Slate. Their next home game is 
Saturday, April 3 at 10 a.m. in doublheader
