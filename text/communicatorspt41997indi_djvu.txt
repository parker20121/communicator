News Repohter 



The smell o( fall is in ibe aii 
Tliat means il is lime lo head 
back lo schcxil. For some, it 
is an end to the freedom of summer 
For oihers, it is jusi an added obsta- 
cle their alfeady hectic schedules. 

Rarely, in this day of fast-paced, 
nisb-rush Nves we live, do we get a 
chance to get lo know other stu- 
denis. If you have taken ihe lime to 
scan any of the many bulleiin boards 
around campus, you may know 
wbal is available lo you and what is 
noL 

So jusl wbai aciiviljes are avail- 
able? If you arrive on campus after 4 
pjoi., then cross die cafeteria off 
your list Due lo an agreement 
belween the university and Aramark 
and because of lack of business, the 
cafeteria closes ai 4 pjn. If you are 
hungry and do noi have lime lo eai 



before class, then you will be glad lo 
know thai vending machines are 
scattered dirougbout the campus, 
carrying a vast assortment of semi- 
nutrilious. or not. snacks Along 
with the vending niachines, are pop 
and coffee machines, with a large 
selection m ihe basement of Kettler. 
Now that food IS taken care of. 
what is there to do wilh any spare 
time you may have? That is where 
the Student Activities Board (SAB) 
comes in. SAB plans activities with 
all students in mind so that the max- 
imum number of people can attend. 

"On a campus like this, with peo- 
ple attending both day and evening 
classes, ii is hard lo get events orga- 
nized," said Kim Jacobs, student 
activities director. 

There are a wide variety of night- 
time events planned up to winter 
break. Comedian Carlos Mencia 
will be performing on Monday. 
Sept. 22, m the Walb Ballroom at 
7:30 p.m. Activities for October 
include a performance by The 



Second City Comedy Troop from 
Chicago. You may remember thai 
the likes of Dan Aykroyd. Gilda 
Radner and John Candy got their 
start in Second City. This is a chance 
to see future Stars of tomorrow. 

Speaking of "stars", there ls a 
UFO lecture on Wednesday. Sept. 
29. at 7:30 p.m in Neff Room 101 
On Nov. 1 3. Craig Karges, a mental- 
ist, will perform at 7:30 p.m. 

There is also a Mystery event 
planned for the middle of the month, 
so be on die lookout for more 
details. 

For families, there will be a 
Breakfast with Santa on Saturday. 
Dec. 13 at 9 a.m. in the Walb 
Baih-oom. 

SAB is always in search of ideas 
for activities and events. They wel- 
come any suggestions or volunteers. 
You can stop by the SAB office in 
Walb Room 231 or call 481-6609 
for information on any upcoming 
events, or a full list of activities. 



Drinkins not much

Three weeks ago. a Louisiana 
college student died of alcohol poi- 
soning He was pledging a fraterni- 
ty and died with a blood alcohol 
coimi of .53, five times 
the legal limit in 
Louisiana. 

Nothing even 
approaching the 
scope of the Louisiana 
event has ever hap- 
pened during the 
tenure of Marian 
Zimmerman, dean of 
students. .,,^ r; 

"We've been- v C- 
very fwiuoaie nol 
to have any inci — 
dents," Zimmerman -^ 
said. 

Zimmerman attributes this 
fact to the living arrangements and 
the age of the smdents at IPFW 

"Our student conduct code does 
nol permit harm to odier people," 
Zimmerman said 

The IPFW Code of Student 
Rights. Responsibilities and 
Conduct. Pan IL Section B, subsec- 



tion 12 says, "Hazmg iis] defined as 
any conduct which subjects another 
person, whether mentally, emotion- 
ally, or |sic] psychologically, to 
anything that may endanger, abuse, 
degrade, or intimidate the person as 
a condition of association with a 
group or organization, regardless of 
the person's consent or lack of con- 
sent" 

All campus Greek organiza- 
tions have nsk management proce- 
dures m place to prevent what hap- 
pened in Louisiana from hap- 
pening here.

ment and 
said that usually

does not Include alcohol. 

"Alcohol is not pan of Rush 
events. You don't have to be an 
alcoholic to be a member," said 
Kirk Braun. sophomore. Phi Kappa 
Theia- 

Braun said most people would 
use Iheir personal judgment on 



whether to drink that much. He also 
said he wasn't sure if there was any- 
thing the fraternity could do to pre- 
vent personal behavior. 

"Typical people pass out like 
anyone else would if they drank that 
much," said Kurt Fremion. senior, 
Phi Kappa Tlela. 

Zimmerman, Braun and 
Fremion all agreed that nothing hke 
the Louisiana incident has ever hap- 
pened here at IPFW. 

The members of the fraternity 
usually keep a watchful eye on par- 
tygoers to ensure their safely said 
Jay Benjamin Cuellai, risk manage- 
ment chairman for Phi Kappa

"Common sense dictates 
wheiher we cut someone off," 
Cuellar said. 

He has cut off people before at 
parties and said he approaches them 
in a calm manner and speaks with 
the person. 

Cuellar said he has even confis- 
cated keys from panyers who have 
consumed too much alcohol. 

"It's personal. There's noihmg 
spelled out &lt;in the Phi Kappa Thela 
handbook)." Cuellar said. 

The fraternity usually has about 
one party a month, "just to break the 
mfHiotony of school," he joked.

More than a number 



By Docme Miller 
Chief Reporter 



As the millennium approaches, 
there are many trends developing as 
far as life patterns are concerned. 
Years ago. a decent living could be 
made if a person only possessed a 
high school diploma. But, as nearly 
everyone knows, m order to earn 
promotions, and s6meiimes to get 
one's fool in the door, a college 
degree is needed. 

According to Frank Borelli, 
vice chancellor of student affairs, 
one does not have to choose 
between a job or classes. Various 



services are available widi extended 
hours to accommodate the needs of 
a variety of students. Those services 
include the Admissions Office and 
the Financial Aid Office. 

Borelh also said that the admin- 
istration is "working hard to make 
IPFW a sludent-eentered cam- 
pus. ..we get feedback from students 
and implement programs that they 
are mierested in, and we will con- 
tinue to make changes as neces- 
sary." 

There are at least two different 
ways for new students to become 
comfortable and less overwhehned 
about the college experience. 

Borelli advises, "attending 



Sludeni OrienUtion Advising and 
Registration &lt;SOAR) and dien fol- 
lowing up with Freshman Success 

Information about any changes 
on campus is readily available for 
collegiate veterans as well as ama- 
teurs Of course, it is up to students 
to utilize those resources that are 
available. 

The basic goal of the adminis- 
irauon is to attract and keep stu- 
dents. 

"Good retention is making sure 
that the student is familiar with the 
campus." said Borelli "We want 
them to be successful and complete 
their degrees."

Student wins award Dragon leaves Klan Minimum wage hiked 



Susan Berghoff, an IPFW accounting major, was awarded an Indiana 
CPA Society Scholarship for 1997-98 acadcouc year. She will receive 
Sl,500 toward her schooling and is one of 10 statewide recipients of the 
scholarship. 

The award is based on campus activities, leadership pou:ntia], com- 
munication skills and scholastic record. 

Berghoff went to work following high school then dropped oul of the 
workforce to concentrate on raising a family. She has returned lo school 
with the desire to earn a degree in accounting and eventually take the CPA 
exam. 

Berghoff will be the first member of her family and of her husband's 
family to graduate with a degree from college. She hopes thai her accom- 
ptishmcnLs will encourage ber sons to follow in her footsteps. She also 
hopes that they wiU acknowledge the importance of higher education and 
realize that it is a goal that they can achieve. 



The American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) has lost its Grand 
Dragon. Brad Thompson of Newville, Ind-, has turned in his pointed hai 
and robe saying thai the hatred the KKK provokes is appalling. 

Thompson helped fellow Klan members come together for demonstra- 
tions in Indiana and other slates. 

Thompson claims that after attending a Catholic mass in Pittsburgh he 
has suddenly seen the error of his ways. The mass was held in order lo 
combat the KKK rally being held in Piitsburgh. 

The Imperial Wizard, Jeffery L. Berry, says Thompson was excused 
from the American Knights and is now a member of another KKK frac- 
tion, the Keystone Knights. Apparently, Thompson had some problems 
wilh the way Berry handled the fmancial affairs of the Amencan KnighLs. 
"I deeply regret and apologize most humbly first of all to all Ihe 
Hispanics, blacks and any other ethnic groups as well as Caucasians," 
Thompson said. 



On Monday while the nation celebrated Labor Day, the 
wage quieUy jumped up to S5.15 per hour. So many workers around the 
nation had much more to celebrate than they had onginally thought. 

The inacase of the minimum wage Is the second phase of an increase 
approved by Congress last summer. The first phase was put into action 
last fall when die minimum wage went up S.50 per hour, from $4-25 to 
S4.75 an hour 

The change will affect more dian the estimated 6.4 milliwi people 
making below S5.15 an hour. Raises in all wages will be seen in order 
lo keep them (wages) in luie. The raise in minunum wages will cause 
employers to increase other wages so that managemeni isn't making less 
than their employees. 

Last fall many workers were affected by the increase in minimum 
wages It is estimated that roughly 10 million workers benefited from 
that increase. 



To have ones indlvlduaiitv completely ignored 

Is like being pushed quite out of life Uke being plown

Di's death calls for alcohol 
awareness, legislation 



Although most of the media 
has blamed the tragedy on 
the seven paparazzi who 
chased Princess Diana's car, il often 
fails 10 acknowledge the hidden 
cause of her deaih, driving while 
intoxicaied. 

The loss of Princess Diana was 
caused by the driver's negligence 
because be wanted lo pickJe his 
brain last Saturday evening. 

The world exposure of this 
tragedy gives a clear message for all 
who choose to put themselves and 
others at death's door-no one is pro- 
tected by drinkjng and driving. 

We can no longer be passive and 
assume it will not happen again 
because we know it happens every 
day. 

Wc not onJy lost a woman, we 
lost her ideahsm and a great portion 
of the figbl towards protecting chil- 
dren from land 
mines, abuse and 
hope for a cure 

for AIDS, How 

many more will ^^^^^^^^™ 
die? How many 
of our loved ones 
will beneedle&amp;!ily 



We all have the fear that some 
of our closest friends who drink 
heavily will become another fatality. 
We can only wait now anxiously for 
thecail. 

Why is it so cool to be out of 
control? People our age enjoy play- 
ing with death by drinking in excess 
until they spew. It's ndiculous for 
anyone to drink until they acquire 
aJcohol poisoning. 

We don't actually believe alco- 
holism is a disease. A person makes 
a choice to drink in the fir^t place. 
People use alcohol to test their ovm 
mortality. We believe these dolts 
actually know exactly what ihey are 
doing. 

They believe if they have gotten 
away with driving while sloshed, 
they can do it again until they are 
either caught or they stop drinking 

This tragedy is a wake up call 
for everyone touched by this afflic- 
tion. It presses 
on tbe beans of 
us all and cer- 
^^^^^™^^B lainly legislators 
who need to pass 



taken as lawmak- 
ers and the public 
protect the rights 
of drivers who 
are clearly out of 
control'' 

Di's wealth 
could not protect 
her from a horri- 
ble death at the 
hands of an alco- 
holic? Most of us Q' 
are fortunate, so 
far. to have not 

experienced this ^^^^^^^^S 
kind of tragedy in 
our life. 

We know 
nothing can prevent a drunk driver 
from killing someone we are close 
to. The police and county sberi^s do 
all they can to suspend drivers 
hcenses of those who swerve off the 
edges oTtheroad. 



Obviously, this has 
not scared people 

nor has it been 
enough to send the 
message that if you 
drink and drive, you

crack down on 

this behavior. 

We need 
to finally 
acknowledge 
that this problem 
wLI not go away 
unless laws in 
Britain. America 
and the rest of 
the world are 
enforced so that 
we might control 
ourselves. 

Even so. 

^^^^^S^S^ l3ws punishing 

this behavior 

cannot prevent 

this careless 

action, France has some of toughest 

DWl laws in the worid. 

Alcohol was a major factor in 

this tragedy, but the media should 

carry quite a bit of blame, 

can be argued that the photog- 



Obviously. this has not scared raphers caused the accident by chas- 



people nor has it been enough to 
send the message thai if you drink 
and drive, you die. 

Remember when Prohibition 
was the solution' No one wants thai 
much governmental control but 
unfortunately many Amencans are 
not able to exercise enough self dis- 
cipline to resist driving while intox- 
icated. 

Many alcoholics continue to be 
protected by their families. This 
internal cover up and this problem 
can only be solved if someone in the 
family blows the wbisde on tbe 
alcoholic's behavior Often family 
secrets prevent the alcoholic from 
living in reality. 

We rarely, if ever, sympathize 
with those alcoholics who claim 
they are victims of the disease. 

We believe individuals who 
choose to use this victimization as 
an excuse to drink and drive, are 
weak.

Without their presence, there 
would have been no need to speed

explaui the BAC of the driver. 

Ironically, two days prior. 
Princess Diana called a press con- 
ference to discuss the problem of 
landmines, 

_ She used her position to bring in 
the'media on this issue 

Unfonunaiely. the media which 
she used to her advantage, was a 
main cause of her death 

We grieve for her and her fami- 
ly and we also condemn the driver's 
BAC and the actions of the photog- 
raphers. 

Even if ibe media wasn't chas-

the driver's ccmdition.

1997. That was 
the day that 
Diana, Princess 
of Wales, died. 
1 was half- 
heartedly 
watching a 
television pro- 
gram on NBC that evening when a 
news buUetm interrupted my view-

simply smed that Princess Diana 
had been involved in a serious acci-

ion, international playboy Dodi Al 
Fayed, had been killed. 

Stunned. 1 continued to watch 
the same boring movie, waiting to 
hear more details. Slowly, more 
information ttickJed in. First, reports 
said that Diana was simply mjurcd; 
she had a concussion, a broken arm 
and a serious thigh Injury Then the 
car's driver was reported dead. And 
finally, tie various world news ser-

Diana bad died at a Paris hospital, 
four hours after the accident had 
occurred

tragedy, the acci- 
dent reportedly 
occurred as tbe 
direct result of a 
chase by the ever- 
diligeni, ever- 
annoying . Di- 
stalking paparazzi 
combined with a 
drunk driver. 
Unconfirmed wit- 
nesses reported 
that several moior- 
bike-riding pho- 
tographers sur- 
rounded Di's car 
and harassed her 
until her ride gave 
chase through a 
Paris tunnel, where 
the Mercedes that 
she was riding in 
slammed into the 
tunnel's wall. 

Normally, 1 don't care much 
what a celebrity does with his or her 
life or times. But Princess Di was 
different. I had grown up with her, 
of sons. 1 had seen her marriage 
begm. I'll admit, I watched the wed- 
ding. Most of the world did. I had 
seen the world's excitement when 
she gave birth to each of her sons, 
future heirs to the throne of 
England. 

1 had watched her marriage dis- 
integrate, as so many do nowadays. 



Her compassion 
WAS so 

UNFLINCHINGLY 
GENUINE THAT IT 
SEEMS HARD TO 
IMAGINE THAT ANYONE 
WOULD WANT TO 

HURT HER. But IT 

SEEMS THAT 
SOMEONE DID. 



over her choice to 
pursue a happy 
life over a Royal 
life. Her destiny 
felt unfair, as 
though 1 had 
watched Di's 
whole life on my 
own personal 
movie screen, of 
sons. Like a 
favorite movie. 
ber life ended too 
soon. 

Princess Diana 
was special, as she 
had this way. this 
knack, for making 

the world accept 

^^^^^^^^ her She seemed 
so true, so honest, so real. At times, 
she seemed like a real person dis- 
guised as a princess. Her compas- 
sion was so unflmchingly genuine 
diat It seems hard to imagine that 
anyone would want to hurt her. But 
it seems that someone did. 

I. for one. will miss her. 1 will 
miss her grace, her dignity and her 
compassion My father said that 
Americans thought highly of Di 
because she embodied the things 
that we value in a strong, assertive 
Amencan woman. She wa.s what the 



into a world of unhappiness, 1 saw world wanted royalty to t&gt;e. 



She may have begun her public 
hfe as a shy woman, stuck in a mis- 
erable marriage, but she emerged 
from the ashes of divorce stronger 
and wiser, more determined than 
ever to u,se her position to belter the 
world. Maybe that was what 
impressed me so much about her. 
There was no "what's in it for me" 
attitude, just a "what can I do to 
make it better" attitude. That's 
impressive, no mailer how you look 
at it. We all need to adopt such an 
oudook. 

I'm old enough to have seen 
many historic events in my life. I 
remember when Elvis died. Heck. I 
remember exacdy what I was doing 
when John Lennon was shot — I was 
makmg molasses cookies with my 
mom in our kitchen when the 
announcement came on the radio. 
My mother stopped and told me 
solemnly, '"1 remember when John F. 
Kennedy was shot. I'll never for- 
get." I understand that solemnity 
now. It's almost a numbness inside. 

Those were the days that tbe 
world, quite literally, stood still. 
TTiis was another. This time I'm old 
enough to have a significant knowl- 
edge of the person and event and it 
hurts a little inside. 1 admired 
Pnncess Di, and. (or me, the world 
has lost a litde polish without her 
gleaming smile to brighten it 1 think 
that maybe my heart has lost a hide 
something too. 



Public killQd Princess Di 



(All oiwn click: Jajen Savage 




Princess 
iDiana was killed 
jin an automobile 
ident the 
ning of 
(August 30 in 
(Pans. Diana's car 
(was being pur- 
isued at the time 
[by photographers 
[looking to get 
some exclusive 
photos to sell to tabloid newspapers. 
This is where the debate has 
begun, "How far should the media 
go?" will be on the lips of many in 
the coming weeks The nickname 
"stalkerazzi" has been attached to 
those who actually make a living by 
hunting celebrities. This is where 
my question comes in, "Why do 
ihey do it?" 

The ajiswer to this is... up to six 
figures. Yes that's right, a photo of a 
particularly popular celebnty can 
generate over a hundred thousand 
dollars. It seems staggering that a 
newspaper could afford lo pay such 
an exorbitant amount for a picture, 
until you realize that they (the 



tabloids) can afford it because of 
dieir high sales! 

The media did kill Diana, but 
only because the public proved that 
it had an incurable appetite for con- 
stant information on this figure. It's 
simple marketing people, no 
demand equals no supply Tliis is the 
least of the two ob^e^vations I have 
made on this incident. 

The second may be a bit ill- 
received. Pnncess Diana is dead, so 

This represents a son of sick- 
ness that has crept into the first 
world mindset: the exaltation of 
celebrities Having not been lo 
Britain yei, 1 will only criticize 
Amencans. We constandy put those 
ui the public eye on pedesuils and 
regard them as being more Ihan 
human. How exactly does this death 
directly effect tbe general popula- 
tion? It doesn't 

Why should so many people be 
going out of their minds over some- 
one they did not know? What about 
the hundreds of Algerians who were 
massacred in an extreme grizzly 
manner? (Many were beheaded.) 



Their story made a few headlines in 
America but you can bei now their 
struggles will be all bui forgotten. 

What makes Diana more impor- 
tant than hundreds of Algerians? I'll 
tell you; she was attractive, famous. 
rich and white. "Oh she was such a 
humanitarian." some will argue. Let 
me tell you folks, there are thou- 
sands of people in the world who 
sacrifice more than the Princess 
would have dreamed to help those ih 
need- When ordinary people die. 
though, no one cares because they 
were never royalty. 

This is only the beginning. This 
story has a good chance of outliving 
OJ. Simpson's entire football 
career Yes, Princess Diana did 
much good in her work with numer- 
ous charities. It is not my intention 
to detract from her kindly nature in 
any way. 

I do not attempt to excuse the 
actions of tbe paparazzi. Nor do I 
condone the reactionary clamorings 
of a media that is creating yet anoth- 
er distraction.

Tips for football widows 



Educated blond: Dawn Snarr 



couniry you'll know whai I'm talk- 
ing about. If you're close lo any 
sports fan then you'll agree with 
wbai I'm saying. 

Were talking the wide world of 
football. Not jusi any spon. This is a 
spon thai has ils own nigbi, thai 
leads boys into manhood, and a 
spon that has its own holiday, the 
Superbowl 

Although the plays, downs. 
yards, and goals seem complex, it's 
concept is simple Get the little 
brown ball to the opposite end 

Now you would think thai with 
those men along the sidelines wear- 
ing those headsets and all the cam- 
eras, microphones, and wires run- 
ning everywhere that there was a 
747 being launched off the field 

The fans are a breed of their 
own. They stand the eniite three or 
four hours dunng the game scream- 
ing their lungs out. Jumping up and 
dow^. and wearing siKh items as 
cheescbeads Come on. and they 
said followers of Kiss, Motley Crue, 
and Meiallica in the SO's dressed 
weird Where else can you find top- 
less men bearing painted symbob 
on their beer guts that spell out their 
favorite team's name. 

You may have noticed this week 
thai your fridge resembles the col- 
lage of food from the days of dorm 
life, chips, hot dogs, and beer Not 
just the regular six-pack bottled 
beer. No we're talking the 24 packs 
of the good stuff No longer is your 
man helping out with dinner, it's 
more like "Baby I'm done with my 



low. you don't want me to miss a 
play do you?" 

Speaking of plays, don't even 
think that means plays on you. 
Ladies I can almost bet you thai you 
could walk down the siairs in 
Victoria Secret's sexiest numbers 
and you couldn't get but a glance 
your way. You might hear, "Are you 
sure you can cook in that outfil?" 

Once the game stam you'll first 
notice the eye contact. It's like 
somebody used Poly Super Grip 
Denture Cream and fixated their 
eyes on the screen. Even the water 
boy IS worih watching dunng the 
game. Don'l presume thai commer- 
cials serve as a break time, because 
they don't. You would not imagine 
the thought that goes into these 
high-tech entertaining commercials 
The whole product line includes 
NFL apparel, shoe endorsements by 
players, or beer 

For the next five long months 
you can expect the man ui your life 
to be preoccupied on Sunday after- 
noon, and Monday nighL 

Anyone's best bet is to find any 
advantage of the situation that can 
be taken and run with it 

First of all, now Ls the tmie to 
shop Any other time you tried to 
carry 10 bags in the door you might 
be given a guilt trip, or the 50 tjues- 
tions speech. I suggest Mondays be 
your designated self night. You'll 
have the best chance of taking the 
check book from bis back pocket 
and indulging. 



sicamy with those body builders 
who aren't watching the game 
You'll have five months of his eyes 
focused away from your thighs, to 
gel into shape. 

Anodier option that one long 
distance company is offering is 
Monday nighLs free These compa- 
nies are smart to finally realize the 
Monday night market of women. 
Why not gab the night away to all 
your other women friends who are 
going through the five month rejec- 
uon period. 

Seize this opportunity to suck- 
up. It you've ba:n a bear to live 
with, or recently made the two of 
you suffer though another week of 
PMS, then now is the time 

Offer to go to the store and buy 
his favorite chips, to bnng hun a pil- 
low, or rub his feeL In only minutes 
he'll see you as a complete sweet- 
heart To double your (uck offer to 
make sandwiches, and cbili for him 
and some of his friends during the 
game Don't be alarmed by some of 
the weird bodily noises they make. 
or the language they may speak. 

Remember Christmas is only 
four months away Stari to put sub- 
hminal messages in his head now, 
so that when you ask for that really 
expensive gift, the idea is already 
there 

Even once you might try sitting 
down and watching the game. There 
are a whole lot of big. muscular 
bodies with tight butu running back 
and forth. How much closer to 
Chippendales tan you get.

achool is back in full swing, 
sopiciurcihLs.... Day in ami 
day out, yoiir opening ihc 
same cover to ihat old, 
woni-oul psychology, biol- 
ogy or trigonometry book. 
Whether ii is a paperback or hard 
cover, the images and words seem 
to be putting you right to sleep. 
Well, snap out of it. Take a break 
and lum those brown eyes "blue." 

"Blue," the first national 
"adventure lifestyle" magazine for 
both men and women, is making its 
debut at newsstands and book 
stores, from now until October This 
magazine was created for the new 
traveler with an adventurous, global 
penpective — the person who rec- 
ognizes the world's diversity and 
accc^sibihty 

"Blue" promotes the philosophy 
of a globally accessible world, one 
whose citi^en.s take advantage of 
the fact that you can be anywhere on 
the map in 48 hours, via air travel, 
the Internet or telecommunica- 
tions," sajd Amy Schncr. the maga- 
zine's founder and publisher/editor- 
in-chief. 

When floating through its 
pages, readers will come across a 
number of thriving interests. The 
interests include: outdoor activities, 
ecological, sociological and cultural 
issues and the quesl for adventurous 
travel. 

The bi-monthly "Blue" is being 
directed toward a distinct group of 
readers, rajigmg in age from 19 to 
49 years. It lakes the readers along 
for the exciting and often thrilling 



outdoor pursuits of hiking, moun- 
tain biking, rock climbing, skiing, 
diving, as well as an unusual rein- 
deer-trekking adventure Plus, ii 
takes the reader traveling from 
Aspen to the Adirondacks and the 
Alps, from Tibet to Tierra del 
Fuego — finding the steepest chffs 



to climb, the crazi est rivers to nde for? 
and the mo si 
unique and intrigu- 
ing comers of the 
globe todLscover, 
Nevertheless 
the information on 
the pages is only 
half the fun with 
"Blue," its innova- 
tive style is what 
makes it irul 
appealing The 
magazine's desigr 
is the work of co- 
founder David 
Carbon, a formei 
professional surfei 
who is intemaiion

Class of 2000. . , Part two— 



Conservatism extends 
to personal choices 



Bloominoton, Ind.— According to 
an ongoing study of incoming fresh- 
men by the Higher Education 
Research Institute at the University 
of California. Los Angeles, the sur- 
prisingly conservative trends of the 
Class of 2000 extend beyond the 
arena of environmentalism and 
retirement attitudes. This conser- 
vatism also eiiiends to attitudes 
about personal choices concerning 
sex and dnigs 

The percentage of students who 
agreed with the statements, "Sex 
between unmarried people is OK if 
diey really like each other," and 
"Marijuana should be legalized." 
was down in both cases between 
1971 and 1996. But the decrease m 
agreement with the latter statement 
bides the fact that agreement with 
legalizing marijuana has been as 
low as 15 percent in 1989 By 1996 
It was back up to 35 percent, com- 
pared to 40 percent in 1971, 

"Given that AIDS was diag- 
nosed when these students were 2, 
and the number of pubUc health 
campaigns we've seen since then, 
the figures on premanial seit sug- 
gest that we might be beginning to 
see some changes m diose attitudes 



among young people," fU Dean of 
Students Richard McKaig said. The 
results from this study were cited in 
a class taught this summer by 
McKaig, 

Interestingly though, while stu- 
dents seemed less interested in pre- 
marital sex and drugs, cigarette 
smoking is again on the rise, partic- 
ularly with women. The overall per- 
centage of freshmen who reported 
that they smoke cigarettes is about 
the same in both 1971 and 1996. but 
since 1985 the figure has doubled, 
from 9 percent to 18 percent. 

"That's an interesting figure, 
because smoking didn't come to 
campus when some seniors decided, 
'Hey, let's take up smoking,'" 
McKaig said. "Smoking came to 
campus when freshmen came to 
campus with die habit" 

Although smoking has 
increased among females, women 
have made positive gains in three 
areas: educational plans, career 
aspirations, and broader attitudes of 
both sexes towards the role of 
women in society 

Women are now more interested 
in pursuing advanced degrees than 
men. In 1996, fully two-ihu-ds (67 7 



percent) of freshmen women report- 
ed that they intended to seek 
advanced degrees, with the most 
notable growth in doctoral and 
advanced professional degrees. 

The career interests of men and 
women have increasingly con- 
verged over the past 25 years. 
spurred pnmarily by changes in 
women's interests: dramatically 
increased interest in the traditional- 
ly-male careers of medicine, law 
and business, and rapidly declining 
interest in careers in school teaching 
and the arts. The largest remaining 
gender gaps are associated with 
some of the most sex-stereotypic 
careers: engineering (10.4 percent). 
primary school leaching (7 7 per- 
cent), allied health (5,1 percent). 
business (5 percent), and nursing (5 
percent). 

The attitudes of both sexes have 
also changed regarding the role of 
women in society The percentage 
of freshmen who agreed with the 
statement, "The activities of married 
women are best confined to home 
and family, " was down from 42 to 
24 percent between 1971 and 1996.

Snoozzzzers dominate this week's NFL schedule 



Head to head u;ith Not BecHley 



There are reasons ihni [his season will 
he the sirangcsi NI-l, season since 
ioc "Willy" Nainath giiarani(!cd a 
viciory in Super Bowl III 

Example: The New York Jets are unile- 
feaicd! ictf George tound a sianing QB jot) 
in Ibe NFL when be should be playing back- 
up behind An Schlicsicr in ihc Arena 
Football League. Warren Moon, older than 
Mcphislophclcs. is sUll playing in ibc NFL 
The New York Jets are undefeated' The 
Buccaneers won a game! Diika is a Sainl? 
Dick Vermeil The New York Jets are 
undcfeBled! Did [ mention ihat the Jtis 
were undefeated? 

This week look lo the Sleelers lo 
rebound from (heir bult-spanking from the 
rejuvenated Cowboys The Jets' honeymoon 
shouldn't last too long, but then again, who 
knows? 

Let us get to tbe glorious predictions: 

Game of the Week: 

Washington at Pitlsbtirgh 

Bill Cowher suffered his worst loss as 
coach last week against the Cowboys The 
Siecters will probably put on a good show 
against the Skins. Don't count too hard on it 
though KordcU Sicwan still hasn't got the 
enpenence yet to be an NFI. QB and his 
knee is suspect. The Skins handled the 
Panthers last week and should be strong this 
week. 
Prediction: Sleelers 17-14. 

Worth watching: 

Green Bay at Philadelphia 

Tbe Pack, after dismantling the 
mediocre Bears, arc on a mission to repeat 
t&gt;on't look for Pbilly to stop Favrc or the 
rest of the Che«seheads The Eagles may 
have a chance if ihey bench Rodney Peeie 
and go with Detmer Detmer knows how to 
win. He may be small and have a hard tune 
getting on ndes at Cedar Point, but at least 
he wasn't coached by Wayne Fonies. 
Prediction: Green Bay 28-10. 



New England at Indianapolis 

Ttie Colts have traditionally had a tough 
time with die PaLs, but New England 
has Pete Carroll running the show 
Carroll's style differs markedly from 
The Tuna Bill Parcells, They pros- 
pered last week under CarroH's system 
and should this week. 
Predicllon: New England 35-23. 

Could hold your attemtion: 

Buffalo at New York Jets 

The only reason to watch this ls lo see if 
Parcells" magic has worn off. Buffalo is in 
a rebuilding year without Jim Kelly Kelly 
had run the offense since the Ice Age (In 
Buffalo thai comes about every six months) 
This year it is Todd Collins' job. Crood luck 
he'll need iL 
Prediction: Jets 17-13- 



Dallas at Arizona 

Dallas has rebounded from a dismal. 
scandal filled season They have remem- 
bered how 10 have fun playing football. This 
Sunday night matchup should keep your 
aitcntion between commercials on die X- 
Files Arizona is a traditional inter- division 
nval and should put up a liiLe fight before 
caving in the second half 
Prediction: Dallas 28-13 

Tampa Bay at Detroit 

The Bucs should make the playoffs this 
year, but the Lions have Barry Sanders 
Sanders is not runnmg in Fonies elementary 
offense this year. He has a blocking back 
who should open up even more holes than 
Sanders creaics on his own. The Lions 
should make this game interesting. 
Predicllon: Detroit 17-10, 



San Francisco at St. Louis 

Coming off an embarrassuig loss to 
Tampa Bay should be all the motivation 




Steve Marriucci 
needs to kick the 49ers inio 
gear But widiout Steve Young's favorite 
receiver, ihe Rams have a small chance. A 
very small chance. 
Prediction: San Francisco 35-20. 

The rest of the field: 

Carolina at Atlanta 

This game is for bragging rights in the 
south. Whatever that means. Atlanta is piti- 
ful and won't be able to handle the passing 
game of Carolina even without Kerry 
Collins in the pocket. 
Prediction: Carolina 27-3 

Tennessee at Miami 

Tbe Oilers still are still in a rebuilding 
year (haven't they been in a rebuilding 
decade?), but they have Eddie George. 
George is an incredible running back. 
McNair has the tools to become a great QB. 
lJp.set of Ihe week: Tennessee 27-23. 

Minnesota at Chicago 

A battle to see who will finish in the 
middle of the NFC Central. Neither one of 



these teams shows anything exciting, but the 
Bears have inept leadenihip (see Rick Mirer 
trade) and should fmish 9-7 or 7-9 
Prediction: Minnesota 13-10. 

San Diego at New Orleans 

At leasi the Saints have Ditka lo sell 
scats m the expanse of the Superdome It's 
not like they could win a game too often 
anyway They won't wm this week and 
probably not for the rest of Sepicmber The 
Chargers have a few pro-bowl players and 
should be able to pull one out. just barely. 
Prediction: San Diego 24-23 

Denver at Seattle 

Seattle lost big at home last week and 
Ihey will again this week. Denver is too 
much for most teams in the AFC. They will 
walk on anyone in Ihe AFC West. SeatUe 
will lay down in front of the Bronco 
Juggernaut. 
Prediction: Denver 37-10 

New York Giants at Jacksonville 

It's hard to bei on the Giants when they 
have Dave Brown taking snaps, but the Jags 
don't have Mark Bruncll They have 

Nairone Natrone will run over die Giants. 



but It still won't be 

enough. 

Prediction: New York Giants 18-16 



Kansas City at Oakland 

Normally this would be a marquee 
matchup, but the Chiefs arc led by Elvis "1 
don't really know what I'm doing yet" 
Grbac and the Raiders are led by Jeff 
"whiny, bad boy wannabe" George. 
Hopefully George will get a spinal injury 
this year so we don'l have to bear about how 
the new team makes bun feel wanted. No 
one wants George, but al least he shaved off 
his dorky mustache 
PredicLon: Kansas City 27-13 

Worst game of the week: 

Cincinnati at Baltimore 

When the Browns moved to Baltimore 
and became the Ravens, they killed the 
greatest interstate rivalry since the bonier 
wars in Kansas during die civil war. 
Prediction: Baltimore 10-7.
