When reciting the Pledge of

throng not to forget the words 
"under Cod." The audience 
complied loudly. Family mem- 
bers who have relatives fighting 
in the battle (or Iraq were also 
recognized for the sacrifice they

believes this plav gives a power- 
ful message. 

"The collected performances

"Recently, a great deal of 
attention, loo much attention in 
my opinion, has l)cen given to 



those who feel that by showing 
disrespect to America, our flag 
and our Commander-ln-Chie^ 
Ihal they are protesting our 
nation's policy. They don't 
respect America." he said to 
thundering applause. "Our 
troops are the front line in 
defense of these righls. And we 
must hold the responsibility to 
be their supporting force." 

Grammy-award winning 
Christian artist and Anderson 
native Sandi Patti sang "The 
Star-Spangled Banner" and 
other American anihems. Other 
local artists performed both in 
song and dance. 

Glenn Beck spoke for 
approximately 30 minutes, 
impressed with the Hoosier 
cro^vd. "You knocked my socks 
off," he said. Beck has held 
about a half dozen tallies in the 
past month, and with Northeast 
Indiana's gathering, he had seen 
over lOO.OOO people supporting 
Ihe troops, he said. 

Beck spoke of simpler 
limes, saying he wanted 
America to return lo a Norman 
Rockwell ' picture, with flag' 
lined streets and a sense of 
knowing who we were. 

"Nonnan Rockwell wasn't 
an artistic genius, he was an 
artistic stenographer. Those 
people existed. They were our 
parents and our grandparents," 

Beck admitted America 
didn't include everybody in the 
Rockwell portraits, but said that

improved over several decades. 
He listed off the decades, but 
said the country lost sight of 



\vhat ivas good ivith the days of 
our grandparents. 

"Instead of taking what our 
grandparents had given us and 
building on top of that, wcstarted 
tearing it all apart. And it all 
came apart. People started 
thinking America was not a 
great place, was not a place that 
would offer a better tomorroiv 
for those today," Bock said. 

He listid off the decades, 
highlighting bad moments and 
bright spats for America 
betiveen the 19405 and 1980s. 
He said the Persian Gulf War of 
lWO-1991 gave a renewed sense 
of patriotism and the military. 
Bui the '90s were also a decade 
of confusion, he told the 
thousands. 

"We started to focus on 
money. We became these garish 
moristers of people. The 'real' 
America — the America of my 
^andparcnls — didn't seem like 
It was real. It was the distant 
past," he spoke. 

And now, protesters arc 
shutting down the streets of 
Washington, D.C. and having 
"vomit-ins" at San Francisco. 
He ridiculed teachers in Maine 
who allegedly told grade- 
schoolers the war was unethical 
and those fighting it were 
wrong, when some of their stu- 
dents had parents in Ihe Middle 
East. 

He ciuoted a memorandum 
from Maine, asking teachers to 
have sensitivity toivard children

"Bull crap. Our families and 
our soldiers don't need our sen-

What are they thinking? War protests: From the Left 



This has gone v/ay too ht. 1 just gol back 
from a Rally Tor America where over 15.000 
parriobc cihiens galhcred lo show support for 

mood when I arrived home lo write Ihis column. 
Then I made the fatal mistake of luming on CNN 
to check the news before I started lo write. 

I was greeted by reports of anti-war protests 
ail over Ihe country. Thousands of Americans 
disrupting traffic, trespassing on govemmenl 
property and generally being a nuisoncc to every- 
one. Not to mention (he fad that these so-called 
pacifists have been growing increasingly violent 
in Ihe past few days. Nothing like hypocrisy to 
make your point 
guys. 



your right ai a dtizen to frcelv speak your mind — 
|ust not now. Think about' the 300.000 United 
Slates soldiers over in Ihe Iraqi desert right no(v 
who can see everything that you are doing back 
here at home. These young men and women 
volunteered to defend the freedom and liberty of 
all Americans, even those who may not agree 
with what they arc doing. What kind of message 
are we sending them with huge anti-war rallies? 
These soldiers will defend you no matter 
what your beliefs are. I think thai ALL Americans, 
regardless of your views of this war, owe il lo 
these soldiers to support their effort. As a former 
member of the armed forces, I can leQ you thai 
the single most important thing to a deployed 
soldier is morale, when morale starts lo fade, 
mistakes are more likely and additional casualties 
can result. What 



Well, il has begun. Oui 



bombi(\g has changed my posi- 
tion on war, I don't believe that 
the dealhs have heightened my 
sense of securit)' as a United 
States citizen. I don'l believe! 



support. I am one of those 
people — one of the Americans 
out protesting against a war 
thai IS contrary to our view of 
America and ite role as a world 
power. I have a voice. Should 



Not i 



this V 




poll showed Ihat 
percent of Amerkans 
support the ongoing 

Iraq. 1 attribute this 
to the fact that 
of you who 

against the war did the righl thing. You stated 
your views and made your case before the war 
started, but once the decision was made, you 
stopped the protesis and put your support 
behind Ihe soldiers. 

Yet there are still many in Ihis country who 
do not get it. Continued protests at this pouil arc 
unproductive and dangerous. At a time tvhen the 
country is at an elevated risk of terrorism, the 
crucial resources of law enforcement agencies are 
being wasted in an effort to keep the demonstrators 
under control Fmandally strapped local governments 
are being forced to eipcna resources Ihey don'l 
have to supervise your dissent. Their time and 
effort should be spent protecting our cities, not 
liscorting protesters. 

Adding insult to injury, many of those 
demonslraling Ihis weekend could care less 
about Ihe war in Iraq, A large number of them just 
dislike President Bush in general, and will take 
advantage of any opportunity to protest anything 
he does. There are many anti-American groups 
such as the pro-Palestinians (tvho hate us because 
we support Israel) and radical Muslims (who just 
simply Kate us) who are using Ihe current situation 
to cause unrest in America lo further their own 
unrelated agendas. The true anti-war movement 
is being used by these other organi7Jtions with- 
out their knowledge, in essence being played for 

I totally respect those of you who have true 
ciinvictions against any war, and I fully support 



my voice be silenced by the roar 
of^ bombs being dropped in a 
distant land? Should my voice 
be silenced by fear — fear of 
;vhat others may think or do. If 
1 just put down my signs and 
shut up, will America be a safer 
place? Well, maybe for me. 

Today at trie peace rally, I 
watched as a car sped away 
after intentionally 
hilling a pcoteslcr. 
How frightening, 



administration's agenda. I don'l 
believe in stifling 3&gt;e press, nor 
in stifling my voice to appear 

Catriotic- 1 am saddened, even 
orrified by the scenes that I see 
on the news. My first response 
to Pfesident Bush's ultiniatuni 
was teats. I cried! I am saddened 
by the loss of life. We hear about 
every American soldier who 
dies and it is horrible. Death is 
horrible, but what about the 
Arabs? What about Ihe civilian 
casualties? Haw liberated will 
the dead be? I have heard vary- 
iboul the number 



the haired shifted from the war to the soldiers 
themselves. Men and women who should have 
received a hero's welcome instead came home lo 
chants of "baby killer" and people spitting in 
their faces. No person, soldier or other^vise, 
deserves that kind of despicable treatment. 

If you want to make a difference in this war, 
pray for peace — a peace that will only come 
when the tyraruiical dictator of Iraq and his 
regime are removed from power. Turn on the 
neivs, and watch the Iraqi people kissing the 
hoots and shaking the hands of our soldiers as 
they are liberated city-by-dty From the oppression 
that Saddam Hussein has held them under for 
years. If anyone in this world has a reason to be 
opposed to this tvar, it would be the citizens of 
Iraq, The fact that the citizens of a country we are 
at war with have more respect for our military 
personnel than many citizens of our own country 
should make aU of us ashamed. 

You see, there is a time for protest — and 
that hme is past. There is a time for debate — and 
that lime is yet to come. There is a time for your 
voice to be heard — Ihat will come in the 2004 
election. 

There is also a time when we should put our 
differences aside and support our country and , 
our military — and that lime, rny friends, is right 



Mars &amp; Venus: Women's sports 



Mars Aski: As everyone probably knows, the 
college basketball tournaments are currently 
being played. Notice 1 said tournaments! I can t 
go to a chunih service without hearing about how 
my pastor's men's bracket is doing, and yet the 
women's loumamEnl barely gels mentioned on 
Sportscenter. Why can't theladies gel no respect? 
What will it take? 

The ladies' game is one of the few places 
where you might see someone coi«tantly fiilting 
a )ump shot, making a good bounce pass or not 
trash talking tvhen their team is down 10 points. 
That's right, I'm Ihroiving a shout out to the 
ladies (did I just say that?). They fa-shizzle my 
nizzte and all that good stuff, 1 wish that Ihe men 
would take a paee from the ladies' book and actually 
play some fundamentally sound basketball. 

I love a good dunk as much as anyone, but 
there are so many of them thai Ihey b^n to all 
look' the same. So I'm going to issue yel another 
boycott and only ivalch the women's tournament 
this year. Well, 1 would if 1 could find il anywhere 
on television. Until then, I guess I'll have to settle 
tor the men's game, and leave you ivith this question; 
Why can't the ladies get no props? 

Venus Responds: Oh dear Mars, it has always 
Ixren this ivay for women! Women have never 
received credit where credit isdue. In sports, edu- 
cation, jobs, it's all Ihe same. Women, outside of 
a domestic role, are, generally, not given much 
respect as males. In the job market today women 
ate still making less money Ihan most men. Not 
to mention that there are still male dominated 



careers II yuu ttfally Ihink about il, at one point, 
all careers were male oriented. Women didn't 
even really start making ft in the job market until 
they were asked to. by a male(the president), 
durincWWD. 

ti^ still see tvomen marrying right out of 
high school and not even considering furthering 
their education. Honestly, without further cdu - 



some sort of support tor the rest of their lives. 

And of course in sports. Maybe it's because 
women are not interesting enough, or fast paced 
enough to hold a viewers attention (both male 
and female alike). Or maybe women are lacking 
respect in Ihe sports area because it has always 
been perceived as a male dominated area. For 
some odd reason I feel that our society is very 
slow to change. For a lot of people, women in 
iiports. actively participating just as much as men, 
can be seen as quite a shock in our conservative 
society. Remember when women wanted to go to 
college? That was a radical change of our society. 
And now, tvomto want lo be treated as equals lo 
men and play sports? What is to come next? A 
total role reversal? Hardly! I just feel that women 
are just now asserting tnemselves more in our 
society and both men and women alike are just 
starting to get used to Ihe idea bi having women 
placed in male roles and succeeding. 

There are some sports whore women are 
recognized quite a bit. Tennis, with the VViUiams 
sisters, is a good example. They are biie, real 
athletes. Bui then agam there are those sports, 
suchasvollcybaJI, where women are watched not 
for their talent but rather their appearance, which 
leads me onto a different topic, lor another day. 




What if our neighbors scare us? 
We think Ihey may cause us 
harm in the future, so we kill 
them and torch their house, 
causing a huge fire that kills a 
few hundred people. Are they 
all just casualties, justified by 
our fear? I am horrified by what 
our leaders are doing and so are 
millions, if not billions of others 
around the world. 

What does patriotism 
mean? An old version of the 
American Heritage Dictionary 
states that a ''patriot" is one 
who loves, supports and 
defends their country. Those 
who serve in our armed forces 
fit that description, but what 
about us, the protesters? 
Because we disagree with the 

Eolicies of this administration, 
ecause we believe in peaceful 
solutions, are we unpatriotic? 
Does defense of your country, 
mean supporting an adminis- 
trahon that has gone against Ihe 
recommendations of the United 
Nations, the peacekeepers of 
Ihe world? Agoveming body that 
we, Americans, were instru- 
mental in founding. What kind 
of message does that send lothe 
world? What happens when 
this is over? How do we rebuild 
world relations? How do you 
rebuild the dead? IVho pays? 



I dor 



belie 



that Ihe 



of civilians wounded, but noth- 
ing specific. After watching the 
footage on television, I am certain 
that there must be civilians 

Our administration says 
that they are doing everything 
Ihey can to kill as few irmocents 
as possible. What number is 
acceptable? How many deaths 
do 1 have to support to be 
patriotic? If Ihis newfound 
patriotism is what is expected 
ofall Americans, then we are all 
in big trouble. I stand firm upon 
my Tove for America, I stand 
firm upon my love of life, all 
life. First and foremost. 1 am a 
spirit being, coruiected to all 
life, I nm a human who views 



brothers. 

I do not' sanction death. I 
am an Amqrican who loves life, 
and I am willing to die for my 
belief, and for my love of life 
and my country. I (vill defend, 
what I believe, America stands 
for: trulh, freedom, life and lib- 
erty for all, regardless of their 
race, creed, color, (and let me 
add) gender and scuual orienta- 
tion. Ibelieve in the rights given 
to me by my Constitution, by 
my Bill of Rights, rights that our 
current admmistration are rap- 
idly taking away. I am a patriot 



and 1 will not shut up. 1 will 
continue to peacefully oppose 
anyone who wants to destroy 
the America I love, even if il is 
my president I encourasc evety 
American lo peace fully Tift their 
voices, lo support their country 
in whatever way Ihey truly 
believe is right. 1 nave a friend 
that has oeen a staunch 
Republican all of hLi life, and he 
is almost 50-years-old. He has 
supported our counlry and has 
stood behind this administra- 
tion, until now. He doesn't 
believe that the current war is 
the solution for our country. 
Has he been a patriot all his 
life? Is he still a patriot? What il 
he prolests? 

I have been alive long 
-■- ■- know the horrors of 

how il affects life, 
lo know pain, 
suffering and 
death. 1 have not 
always been a 
iftstllisadif- 
icullpath. I lived 
through Vietnam 
and the protesis. 1 
believe that the 
voices of the pro- 
testers brought 
that war to an 



footage of the deodondtvoundcd. 
I have been friends with many 
Vietnam veteraas. They are all 
permanently scarred by their 
experiences. I also have friends 
who are Gulf War veterans suf- 
fering from Gulf War syn- 
drome, unacknowledged and 
uncompensated by their gov- 
ernment. 

Today at the peace rally I 
me I a representative for 
Veterans for Peace. Are these 
veterans who fought for our 
country not patriots because 
they are protesting? What 
makes us patriotic? What is 
your definition of patriotism? U 
It is different than mine, should 
I yell al you, assault you or kill 
you? Would thai make me a 
good American? 1 believe in 
Rarma. Every action has an 
equal and opposite reaction. 
Everythi^ng we do has conse- 
quences. America has and is 
continuing lo build a debt that 
is much larger than our national 
deficit. One day we will have to 
pay. That thought deeply sad- 
dens me and I will not partici- 
pate in this war effort. I will not 
support something that, deep in 
my soul, I feel is wrong, not 
even for my counlry. But that's 
just my opinion. 



Scholarly Message: Letter to the Editor 



Albert Eirulem drafted this message in 
1945 at the beginning of Pox Americana or the 
American Empire lo oe read to a national con- 
gress of scientists that was not held. Il is time 
that the scholarly community here his message 

"I am sincerely gratified that the great 
majority of scientists are fully conscious of their 
responsibilities as scholars and world citizens; 
and that they have not fallen victim lo the wide- 
spread hysteria that threatens our future and 
that of our children. 

It is horrifying lo realize Ihat the poison of 
militarism and imperialism threatens lo bring 
undesireablech.inK&amp;in the political atlitudea of 
the United State- Wh^t wi' ■^■,- ,ii u orV. htre i.s 



not an expri-ssion of the 
American people; rather, it refiects the will of a 
powerful minority which uses its economic 
power to control the organs of political Ufe. 
Should the government pursue this fateful 
course, we scientists must refuse lo submit lo its 
immoral demands, even if they are b.icked by 
legal machinery. 

There is an unwritten law, Ihat of our own 
conscience, which is far more binding than any 
bills that may be devised in Washington. And 
there are, of course, even for us, Ihe ultimate 
weapons; non-coorperation and strike."

Indoor team debuts with a win, sets league attendance record 



M a blindine cloud of billowing fog 
rolled oniD Ihc Reld, members of the fronl 
office barked oul orders to coliseum workers, 
hoards of pjtolechnics exploded on the 
fields and &amp;mncm's "Lose Yourself" blared 
from the massive Memorial Coliseum 
speakers, signaling the entrance of your Fori 
Wayne Freedom, CH-er 9,000 fans packed the 
arena, which holds )usl over 9300. to set a 
new NIFL attendance record. 

"It's going to lake a few games for us to 
pick up the whole concept of the game, A lot 
of these guys are outdoor players, so it's a 
little harder to adjust lo the indoor game." 
said former Arizona Slate walk'On and 
back-up Freedom quarterback Ryan Corder. 

But. adjust they did. Evansvilie 




BJUL'ints kitkLT Tuny Hi.irda pl.iced the foot- 
ball iin a kickiilf let.- as anticipation mounted 
inr buth of these NIFL eipansion teams and 
thousands of fans. It was Freedom running 
back/defensive back Brian Gaines who 
received the honor of returning that first 
kickolf, Gaines brought theball up for seven 
yards and the adjustments began.

SI. Francis quarterback Anioine Taylor,

A poiHHl Taylor looked dotvn Ihe ficl'd And 
provedhisworthby making Ihe first play in 
franchise history a success. Taylor connected 
ivith tvide receiver Casey Donaldson for an 
ciRhl yard gain. 

But Ihc upcning drive of the game, season 
and franchise didn't stop Ihcre. Several 
plays later, Taylor hooked up with former 
St. Francis teammate Jeremy Dutcher for a 
big touchdown, 

Evans\'ille, who also is part of Ihe NIFL 
Atlantic East Conference along with the 
Freedom, Tennessee Riverhawks, Levingtiin 



Horsemen, Myrtle Beach Stincrays and 
defending league ctiampion Ohio Valley 
Greyhounds responded with two scores of 
their own in the first quarter But it was Ihe 
Taylor-Donaldson combmation that tied Ihe 
game 14-14 with |ust :4Z left in Ihe quarter. 

After a very fast paced and high scoring 
first quarter, the second started oul slowly. 
The back and forth football didn't pick up 
until there was just 9:16 left lo play, when 



rkod up, it slowed down. With a few 
minutes left in Ihe half, the Freedom 
regained possession again, bul this lime 
with a renewed spiril. 

Taylor worked Ihe ball doivn Ihe field 
with help from his capable wide receivers 
and ex-Illinois rusher Rocky Harvey, Wilh

for a simple touchdown pass, John Diellrich 
missed the extra point, leaving the Freedom 
with a 20-14 lead. 

On the Bluecats' final drive of the half, 
with -33 lo play. Freedom lineman Rachman 
Crable sacked Bluecat Quarterback Akili 
Roberson, polenlially ending Ihe th«at. But 
a personal foul called on Ihe Freedom's Ron 
Broivn swilched the momentum back lo 
Evansville. On the neil drive, wilh :28 lo 
play, Roberson connected with Tyrone 
Browning lo lie Ihe game up yet again. 

It was on this louchdo\vn play that Ihe 
game suffered its first and only casualty, ns 
Ihe Bluecats' behemoth 6'10", 360 pound 
offensive lineman Seth Morris wcnl down- 
Morris' right leg was placed in a brace and 
he 1V3S helped off the field. Later Morris 
relumed lo the Bluecat bench in street 
clothes with only a sprain. 

The defensive brickwall of Jason 
Batlershell and Limonl White stopptti Ihe 
Bluecat two- point conversion a Hem pi, 
keeping Ihe game 20-20. thus pro\'ing the 
worth of the amazing Freedom defense. 

"We fixed our coverage mistakes early. 
And we knetv thai Ihese guys were fired up. 
They were ready lo come and Ihey kept 
beating Ihem down and beating them 
doivn. They really stepped up hard when 
they had to," said Head Coach Rich Huff 
about his defense. 

The third quarter slowly rolled by (vilh

4th and goal after Ihre" big defensive stops 
by Fori Wayne. The Freedom answ'cred four 
minules later wilh another Taylor-Dutch cr 
hook-up. However, the Freedom managed 
to do what Ihe Bluecats couldn't by scormg 
an extra point, which gave Ihe Freedom a 
27-26 lead heading into the final quarter. 

It didn't take long for Evansville lo 
answer back in the fourth. Seven seconds 
into Ihe quarter. Roberson. this time on Ihe 
rush, added another score for the Bluecats. 



and a personal foul an Evai

A personal foul on the ensuing 
Evarisville drive by Gaines was looking to 
shift the momentum back lo Ihe Bluecats. 
(Dn Ihe next play, Roberson fumbled the 
football, however Evansville recovered 
Tha-e minules later, Roberson finally found 
his man in the end/one, once again connect- 
ing wilh Browning. After taking a hard hit. 
Browrung spiked the foolball. leading lo a 
personal foul call, much lo the delight of Ihe 
Fort Wayne crowd. The defense held strong, 
blocking the Bluecat extra point to leave the 
game 34-10. 

Knowing it was most hkely Iheir final 
drive of the ^ame, Ihe Freedom took their 
time. Not until 2;I6 did they pound in their 
fmal score. It ivas at that lime ivhen Har%'ey 
delivered a blow to the Bluecat defense wilh 
a one-yard touchdown run. led by Ihe plow 
of Batlershell. The extra poini by Diellrich 
gave the Freedom a one-point lead. 

With 2m lo play, Batlershell smothered 
Ihe kick return to hall any potential Bluecat 
momenttim. Roberson tried desperately to 
find any play, but wilh 30 to play, he lost his 
footing and was sacked for the final time by 
Crable. As lime ticked aivay, Ihe Freedom 
rushed the field, 4140 winners. 

"[It was] loo close for my comfort. But, 
it came together when it had to. Offense put 
it together all night long; we had a couple of 
rough spots. But, 9-10,000 people in here 
and it gets hard to hear. So that was our )?ig 
problem of offense really," Huff said, 

"1 thought we played as a team IVe 
had to overcome some adversities," added 
Taylor, who Ihrew for 1B2 yards and five 
touchdowns. "Some penalKes that kind of 
set us back. I Ihihk we picked up, came back 
and played well." 

The Freedom celebrated into the nighl 
as a new tradition started in Fori Wavne, 
Whether this wiU be a passing fad or iong 
standing tradition, only time wiU tell Bul 
Huff is definitely ready lo prepare for next 
week's home showdown wilh the expan- 
sion Tupelo FireAnlz. 

"V^e have lo conununicale better and

Tossers work for punk ethic in 'Purgatory' 



By Jonah Crismorc 

fMliirrs £.ii(!ir 

The deslrucltvoness of the 

bands has taken Ha toll on the 
communily Eoi the last few 

Poivcr pop clones have 
taken over the airwaves, often 
killing the fun nature and origi- 
nality of Ihe bands from tvhich 
they are trying so hard to be like. 

The once-underground and 
great label Hell-Cal nas turned 
its allention lo gelling bands like 
Rancid, Dnipkick Murphys and 
the Distillers on MTV. It would 
seem there is no help for the 
current slate of great under- 
ground music. 

Howei'er. there is a slight 
hope for Ihe ethics of bands ivho 
have passed, leaving the motto 
of not selling out any cost. 

Thi' hope, thoufih. has 



punk bands than would have 
probably been thought of a few 
years ago. These bands are Ihe 
Celtic punk bands, uniting in a 
cause not lo sell out their morals. 



I papul 



they 



may become. 

One of Ihe bands leading 
this front is Chicago's The 
Tossers on Thick Records. 

The Tossers play their 
music with a great mix of tradi- 
h'onal Celtic instruments and a 
piink ethic condenming every- 
thing from corporate greed to 
police brutality. 

Their newest release. 
"PuiEfllory" is the perfect folloiv-up 
to tneir classic "Long Dim 
Road" tvhich was also released 
on Thick Records. 

The album begins with an 
inslrumenlal called "With Ihe 
North Wind" ihal leads into the 
vocalijfd "Here We Go Again." 



The slow pace of the it\slromi.n- 
tals with tile faster vocal p.irl oi 
the song set Ihe tone lot ih,' 
album, which often aHLm.ilL-. 
between Ihe extremely ia'-t .imi 
Ihe slow ballads. 

Songs like "Chicago" shmv 
songwriter T. Duggins love and 
displeasure of the city where he 
lives. With his portrayal of the 
heroin addicts and ganglords he, 
even though he remains opti- 
mistic, tells the listener Ihe Irou- 



The stand-out track 
album is "Monday Momine,' 



the 



deriving inspiration from ihe 
Pogues classic "Tuesday 
Morning." The Tossers created a 
drinking song that not only 
shows the pleasures of alcohol, 
but also shows this band holds 
punk on ils shoulders. 



Michael Moore demonstrates true freedom 



Then 



IS supposed to be 
: red carpet was 



no glili. The red carpel 
rolled up and sent away to some 
HoUynfood warehouse. Even Ihe 
parties aflcnvard were supposed 
to be more low key and less 
boisterous. 

These were all the prv.'cau- 
lions that Ihe film academy took 
al the 7Sih Annual Academy 
Awards on Sunday in' an 
allempt to show their respect 
and support for Ihe troops in Ihe 
current war agairwl Iraq, 

Even hosl Steve Martin 
remarked about Ihe evening. 
"We don't have a red carpel, thai 
will show them." 

Other Ihan taking down 
some of Ihe decorations for the 
evenl and not having coverage 
dominating the airwaves, there 
ivas supposed to be a mutual 
agreement that the Oscars tvcre 
not going lo be a platform to 
express celebrities' vie%vs on the 

' These wishes were 
acknowledged for the most part 
until legendary documentary 
dinxlor Michael Moots accepted 
his award (or Best Documentary' 
for his film 'Bowling for 
Columbine." 

The film maker accepted 
his aivard with all olher nomi- 
nees present with him because 
as he said. They're here in soli- 



darity with me because we like 
non- tic lion. We like non-fiction, 
and we live in fictitious times." 

It tvas al those commenls 
that boos began lo Gil Ihe Kodak 
Theatre ivhere Ihe Academy 
Awards were held. 

Not holding back, Moore 
continued, waving his Oscar like 
a scepler to calm Ihe audience 
and have thejn listen to what he 



hadli 



say. 

He said. "We live in a time 
ere we have a man sending 
In .L.,r for fictitious reasons. 



This 






with more boos from Ihe 
audience, along with a few 
cheers. The audience became so 
enraged that Moore could not be 
heard when he attempted lo 
finish his speech. 

Thankfully, Moore did not 
apologize for his commenls 
when he was questioned by the 
press backstage. 

"You doo.'i leave your 
dliTenship when you enter the 
doors of Ihe Kodak Theatre," 
Moore said, adding that he 
believes he put America in a 
good light because the ivhole 
world can see ivhat kind of free- 
dom the dtizens of the United 
Stales have.

not be heard in its entiiety. the

S&gt;imi.'limes I just wish it all could be different. 

What if ive could change around certain 
events in professional spotls history? 

There is a rap song by a guy named Fredro 
Starr called "What If." In Ihe song, he asks that 
question about several events in history, including 
"Whal if Ewing would have dunked it instead of 
fading away? The Knicks would have been Ihe 
champs, he wouldn't have got traded away."

What If... Christian Laettner had not hit the 
buzzer beater in Ihe Final Four against Kenluck)' 
in 1992? Well, obviously Kentucky would have 
won. The Wildcats would have gone to the finals 
lo face Michigan. Gut most importantly, ivhat 
would have happened lo Duke? k it possible that 
a loss lo Kentucky would have squandered the 
Blue Devils' NCAA reign? 

Imagine if you will, Duke not being a power- 
house. Could it be that Duke's loss would have 
sent the NCAA so out of whack that instead of 
Duke, Colgate became the next big college 
basketball dynasty? 

What If... Dale Earnhardt had been leading 
the Davlona 500 in 2000 instead of being in third 
on the last lap? Whal if instead. Ken Schrader. who

Dons slow out of gates at home 

IPFW fails to recover from slow start against Toledo 



Once the U-HV boscball 



By that time, ^e Rockets 
held a five-run lead. The Dons 
were never able to recover as 
they fell lo Toledo 12-7 Monday 
at the IPFW baseball field. 

"No question (the first 
inningl Kt Uie tone." said IPFW 
coach Billy Gemon. "I thought 
our guys did well as far as fight- 
ing and competing throughout 
the game. They never gave up. 
but when you re at this level of 
baseball against a MAC team 
like that, you [ust don't spot 
them five runs. We scratched 
and clawed, and at one point ii 
looked like we were going to 
make a run. We just left too 
many runners on base." 

David Zachary started on 
the mound for the Dons, and the 
Rockets quickly zeroed in on his 
pilches. Toledo got sbi hits and 
five runs, including four earned 
runs, while IPFW managed [usl 
one out. The IPFW coaching 
staff then pulled Zachary and 
put Kellen Marshall on Ihe 
mound in relief. 

"David Zachary had great 
stuff in the bullpen. I IhougKl he 
had great stuff to stiirt the game, 



we made a move lo gel him out 
and brought in Kellen Marshall. 
Kellen held their hitters doivn 




IPFW's Kellen Marshall pitches during the second 
inning of Monday's game against Toledo. Marshall 
pitched 5 2/3 innings for the Dons, giving up five

field teams have bi-cn Mc to 
make great siridcs in Iheir first 
Ihrw seasons. 

Only a ytar ago, IPf^ 
entered its second season with 
just over 30 athtcles. With 30 
men and 24 ivomen this season, 
the Mastodon men finished their 
indoor season wilh a 6-1 record 
while the women went 4-3. The 
Dons arc looking to take that 
success outdoors when they 
open the ouldoor season Friday 
at the Purdue Invitational at 
West Lafayette. 

"We're real optimistic. We 
came off a good indoor season, 
and we're getting charged back 
up for the ouldoor," said IPFW 
coach Rick Norton. "The outdoor 
is a little bit different monster 
from the standpoint that you've 
got the outside elements to deal 
with. We're alaslightdisatl vantage 
because ive don't have our otvn 
facility. We have ID linger on the 
availabilily of a surroundinc 
■rack and none of the hign 
schools art' ptcp.ired to have 

Dons slow 



Iheir stuff outside betause Iheir 
ouldoor season starts so much 
later than ours." 

The Dons have managed to 
gel by, though. Rather Ihan 
running on a track, the IPFW 
squads use area roads and 
parking lots for praclices. 

"We give a new definition 
to jumping over hurdles, even in 
our own sport." Norlrai said. "And 
I guess if it was easy, then it 
wouldn't bo worth iL Being able 
to work with kids who want to 
be here, regardless of the 
situabon. lells me that they love 
track." 

As for the throwers, IPFW 
recently finished building a 
practice area. 

"The exciling thing aboul il 
is wc just linished putting in a 
throwing area, so now the 
throwers have a place to Ihrow 
the javelin, the hammer, Ihe shot 
and discus," Norton said. "We 
actually have our own facility 
for Ihe Ihroivs, and that's a step 
in the right direction." 

And it's probably no coinci- 
dence Ihal Norton has seen 
much improvement in the throw- 
ing events. Hoive\'er, he also saiv 
improvement elseivhere. 

"All the throws. The Ihroivs 



iicroii the board, men and 
women, all showed good 
improvement," he said. 'We set 
27 out of 34 possible records, so 
we had improvements all over 
the place.- 

The Mastodons wiU be led 
by four seniors, three on Ihe 
men's side and one on the 
women's. On the men's team. 
captains Mark Hopkins and 
Paul Trahin. along with Jeff 
N id linger, will lead 24 freshman 
and sophomores, while Franky 
Vandcrpool is the lone senior on 
the women's sc[uad. 

"Ttie seniors on the team 
haw almost dei'doped the program 
to a certain degree. They really 
didn'l have anybody before them," 
Norton said, "It's a great opportu- 
nity for Ihose athletes lo demon- 
strate leadership. With virtually 
no seniors, we're getting leader- 
ship from everybody because 
the procram is so neiv. We do get 
leadership from the upperclass- 
mcn, but they too have only been 
involved for Ihree years." 

Joining Hopkins and Trahin
