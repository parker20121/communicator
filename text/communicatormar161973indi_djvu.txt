THE 
COMMUNICATOR 



INDIAN/ .UF 



Issue III, Volume 17 



Indiana-Purdue University at Fort Wayne 



March 16, 1973 







Indiana-Purdue tennis enthusiasts petition for courts on campus. 

TENNIS, ANYONE ? 



It's too bad that the Ind- 
iana-Purdue tennis enthu- 
siast can't prove his ath- 
letic skills on this cam- 
pus. According to the res- 
ponse to a petition being 
circulated by the tennis 
committee, the students at 
Indiana-Purdue show a de- 
sire to play tennis at both 
the intramural and inter- 
collegiate level. 

Tennis courts would prove 
to be very beneficial to the 
athletic program by ex- 
panding the number of in- 
tramural sports available 
to the activity card holder 
and by providing an on cam- 
pus site for varsity tennis 
competition at the intercol- 
legiate level. 

Tennis is one of the best 
forms exercise and a great 
deal of fun. Most students 
don't get enough exercise 
and would like to by playing 
tennis but can't because 
they don't have time to find 
an unoccupied court In the 
Fort_ Wayne area. Tennis 
courts on Indiana-Purdue 
would help eleviate the pro- 
blem of overcrowding of 
public courts in Ft. Wayne, 
where tennis Isbecomming 
more and more popular and 
would make an unoccupied 
court more readily avail- 
able to the Indiana- Purdue 
students. 

Every student pays $15 a 
semester as an activity fee 
of which $5 goes to the Ath- 
letic Fund, Don't you think 



you deserve more than a 
couple of ping-pong tables 
for your money? Tennis 
would be one more soort for 
both the male and female. 
Everyone could benefit 
from tennis courts, even if 
you don't know how to play 
there are going to be pro- 
grams where you could 
learn. 

Tennis courts could be the 
first of many athletic fac- 
ilities to be constructed on 
the campus. 

It is our hope that bas- 
ketball courts, volleyball 
courts, an Ice skating pond, 
a swimming pool, and other 
athletic facilities will be 
constructed some time af- 
ter the tennis courts If not 
in conjunction with them. 
But, we should remember 
that "Rome wasn't built in 
a day" and since there is 
such a great Interest in ten- 
n's this would seem to bea 
good place to start. There 
are a great many tennis en- 
thusiasts who are willing to 
work for these tennis 
courts and there is a strong 
possibility that they can be 



financed to some extent 
through donations. 

Once the funds are obtain- 
ed there Isn't anything to 
prevent the Instillation of 
the courts. The location has 
been determined and the 
courts would be located 
northeast of the Student U- 
nion Building. To the west 
of this location Is the fu- 
ture site of the HYPER 
Building, which won't be 
built for at least 4 years. 
It has been planned for the 
courts to be constructed at 
the time of the HYPER 
Building's construction. 
However, it seems redicu- 
lous to wait for outdoor ath- 
letic facilities until this 
time. 

The faculty and adminis- 
tration seem to bebery 
much behind the tennis 
committee's proposal to in- 
stall the courts before the 
HYPER Building is con- 
structed and will be work- 
ing closely with them over 
the next few weeks.

STEINEM!!

Gloria Steinem, crusader for women's rights and pub- 
lisher of MS. Magazine spolcetoanoverflowcrowd in the 
lU-PU Student Lounge about the feminist movement and 
the Equal Rights Amendment. Sharing the platform with 
her was Margaret Sloan, noted biacl&lt; feminist. 

Ms. Steinem charged that woman's position in life was 
not a natural one, but a political one, created and per- 
petuated by man to exploit her for her cheap labor. She 
and Ms. Sloan also used the program as an opportunity 
for local women's groups to malce themselves known to 
the public.

BLACK FRATERNITY 
Dear Editor: 

Indiana-Purdue campus 
would like to welcome Kap- 
pa Alpha Psi (raterpity. A 
short chronicle on Kappa 
Alpha Psi's history is as 
follows. On the 5th of Jan- 
uary, 1911 ten dedicated 
brothers formed the first 
chapter (Alpha chapter) at 
Indiana University, the 
first polemarch of Alpha 
chapter was Bro. Elder 
Watson Diggs, who in 1924 
received the fraternity's 
highest award, the laurel 
wreath. The laurel wreath 
has only been received by 
17 brothers in the history 
of the fraternity, the se- 
cond highest award, the El- 
der Watson Dlggs award, 
has only been given to six 
fraternity brothers, as you 
can see these awards are 
only enjoyed by a few of us. 

They are given on the ba- 
sis of personal achieve- 
ment. In 1919 the scroller 
club was founded at Ohio 
State University by Brother 
William J. Madison. The 




The writing on the wall in the old folks' home. 



purpose of the scroller's 
club Is to orientate pledges 
on history and traditions of 
Kappa Alpha Psi and to pre- 
pare them for initiation in- 
to the fraternity. All active 
chapters are required to 
maintain a scroller club in- 
to which all pledges arein- 
ducted into and registered 
with nationalheadquar- 
ters. 

I would like to say a little 
moreabout Bro. Elder 
Watson Diggs. He dedicated 
his life to the ideals of his 
beloved Kappa Alpha Psi. 
He saw a fraternity as an 
instrument for assisting 
the intellectual, moral and 
social development of un- 
dergraduate youth. In 1947 
Elder Watson Diggs died. 
In his memory a monument 
of brick and stone was con- 
structed at the fraternity at 
Indiana University. He 
played a major role in our 
fraternity and he is loved 
today by its members for 
his work. Two other bro- 
thers, Byran K. Armstrong 
and John M. Lee worked 
with brother Diggs on the 
Kappa coat of arms motto 



and ritual, here in Fort 
Wayne. 

So Fort Wayne has played 
its role in Kappa history. 
In 1957 the Kappa consti- 
tution under went major re- 
vision in order to keep it in 
touch with the times, and 
make room for internation- 
al expansion. On December 
13, 1958, Delta Phi chap- 
ter was organized at Ind- 
iana Institute of Technolo- 
gy, and in February 1971 
the Alumni chapter was or- 
ganized and chartered. On 
February 27, 1973 Kappa 
Alpha Psi became recog- 
nized on the Indiana-Pur- 
due campus at Fort Wayne. 
Delta Phi and Alumni have 
been working together to 
promote Kappa Alpha Psi 
in the community. We have 
been involved in many wor- 
thwhile programs for the 
community. So remember 
that Kappa Alpha Psi has a 
tradition of brotherhood 
and togetherness.

government 

news 



To assure a student's 
voice in the projects con- 
cerning the Student Union 
Building, the present Stu- 
dents' Government has for- 
mulated a committee of nine 
students. This commKtee 
provides the first input of 
student direction of the U- 
nion Building in two years. 
Students Tim Peffley, Jim 
Henson, Dick Eckert, Ruth 
Lantz, Char Snearing, John 
Perkins, Charlie Pratt, 
Eric Forst, and Brock Able 
were appointed to the "Stu- 
dent Union Building Com- 
mittee." Their resoonsi- 
bility will be centered on 
placing prolrities on fypc- 



tions within the building, 
policies, procedures, de- 
corum of the lounges, and 
any further recommenda- 
tions of Union Building pro- 
jects. 

Day-Care 
Center 

After two years of plan- 
ning the Students' Govern- 
ment Is proud to announce 
that a Day-Care-Center 
will be made available to 
the students. Student Body 
President Brock Able stat- 
ed in the March 9th edition 

. (?f th? .(^Qpimupif^^qi;,. i;hat. 



the Students' Government 
is now awaiting Dean Ul- 
mar to send them the final- 
ized budget. Student Sena- 
tor Tom Blackburn of the 
Students' Senate Day- 
Care-C enter Committee 
has drafted a a resolution 
supporting the implemen- 
tation of the center. Brock 
Able further emphasized 
that this project is not a 
service but another acti- 
vity in which the students 
can participate. Many Stu- 
dent Senators expressed 
the feeling that the Center 
has long been needed since 
approxlmently one-half of 
the students are married. 



Like bees to honey the wo- 
men came to hear Gloria 
Stelnem. A full house, over- 
whelmingly female, listen- 
ed as sweet melodious 
sounds poured from the 
mouths of Ms. Stelnem and 
her co-star Ms. Margaret 
Sloan, A much heralded 
evening was highlighted by 
numerous surprises the 
most prominent being Ms. 
Steinem's tack of surpris- 
es. She said nothing new. 
We could have gotten her 
speech from the pages of 
any newspaper and probab- 
ly with more depth. 

Her speech apart from un- 
eventful was dull. She spoke 
of neither her working for 
Hugh Hefner as a club bun- 
ny nor her working for the 
CIA, the two subjects most 
curious to me. She stimu- 
lated not the mind but the 
emotions of the audience 
with well worn cliches 
wrapped indemagoguery so 
well even George Wallace 
would have approved. No- 
thing was said that made us 
leave the lounge in search 
for articulate rational ans- 
wers to the Issues present- 
ed, we onl&gt; reacted. Her 
most redeeming quality 
Tuesday may have been her 
physical appearance; at 39, 
Gloria is one "Sexy 
broad", (quoted from Jay 
Walker of WLYV Radio on 
March 13, 1973). 

Speaking before Ms. Sloan, 
I at first thought it a tact- 
ical error, after all the au- 
dience was there to hear 
her. However, lean see why 
Ms. Sloan followed, she was 
a far superior entertainer 
than was Ms. Stelnem. 
Gloria was dull, let's face 
it, she just did not come up 
to expectations. But Ms. 
Sloan, ah, she was differ- 
ent. No one knew what to ex- 
pect from her and was not 
disappointed by her. She 
was very lucid, very easy 
going, notlcably accus- 
tomed to crowds and speak- 
ing and conveyed it to the 
audience. Ms, Sloan was a 
hit, Gloria was so-so. They 
did, however, do one thing 
consistently well. They 
held the audience. They 
manipulated the audience 
well and performed super- 
latlvly. 

A number of point s brought 
out be Stelnem and Sloan 
deserve attention. For 
members of the press they 
were extremely harsh In 
their assessment of the 
presses response to the 
Women 6 Movement. Bi- 
ased, irresponsible and er- 
roneous reporting were 
tops on the complaint list. 
A similar point of view is 
held by certain members 
of the present national Ad- 
ministration. I sympathize 
with the press corp, they 
can't seem to please any- 
one. 

Another point that was 
brought out was the recent 
"victory" the women won 



at the hands of the Supreme 
Court. Abortion on demand. 
Ms. Stelnem et. al. were 
unable to distinguish the 
Right to Privacy from the 
inherant superior Right to 
Life, It's tragic that their 
prejudices are so ingrain- 
ed in their lives that they 
can't even consider the 
possibility that they're 
wrong. Tragic also for the 
innocent children who are 
slaughtered. 

Another event in the eve- 
ning was the vicious attack 
on theSoc I o logy Depart- 
ment. It's Ironic that this 
bastion of chic causes and 
relevant studies known for 
its "progressive" views 
should have sustained such 
accusations. Sociology 
profs pride themselves in 
their revolutionary fervor, 
apparently they haven't 
conveyed It to their stu- 
dents. 

Returning to the Hilton Inn 
tuesday afternoon, Ms. 
Sloan was relating to Sally 
Reed of the Journal-Ga- 
zette a common complaint 
they have on the stereo- 
typing of lifestyles. Ms. 
Sloan wxpiained that one of 
the most frequent questions 
directed to Gloria was, 
"Are you married?" as If 
Che only way a woman could 
be a complete person was 
to h a V e a husband. In t h e 
same light, you never hear 
anyone asking Ralph Nader 
If he's married Implying a 
woman is not necessary to 
make a man successful but 
the reverse Is true. 

This started me thinking. 
What a fantastic combin- 
ation, Na d er-Stelnem or 
Steinem-Nader which ever 
you prefer. Just envision 
If you will this duo, the 
champion of the consumer 
and the Amazon lady. Ter- 
rific! And the future, what 
would the future hold? Just 
listen to the pitter patter 
of little feet running around 
the apartment (She decided 
not to abort her asexually 
produced children) later, 
growing up to be playpen 
activists, day care center 
activists, grade school ac- 
tivists and so on and soon. 
In the year 1977 we see Na- 
der-S t e I n e m seceding 
from Che union and estab- 
lishing their own Utopia in 
Southwestern New Mexico 
combining elements from 
all of today's protest move- 
ments and creating a Brave 
New World.
