ip artment living for some IPFW 



'At $39 a week for food and lot 
students would have to go a long v 



Problems, however, do arise. Evonne 

stated that in her dorm, three out of four 
showers don't work. Because of this, 
sixteen girls must share one shower. 

When confronted with this situation,

The major problem in Yurio's opinion,

unlike a large campus like Bloomington, 
there are only small groups of students 
living in the dorms. Students get tired of 
seeing the same people, he continued, 
and don't show much interest in group 
activities. Concordia is really trying to
