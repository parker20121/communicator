Vets eligible for training 

Recent legislation has been passed that extends eligibility for unemployed 
Vietnam Era and Korean Conflict veterans under Ihe Jobs Training Program. 

"A veteran's Certificate of Eligibility will now be valid for » days from the dale 
il was issued. Also, the period an employer has to apply for approval has been 
extended lo Feb. 28, 1985," said Roy C. Wetherell, director of the Veterans 
Administration Regional Office In Indianapolis. 

"This program ma rks the first time employers have been paid directly to train 
and hire veterans," said Wetherell. "II pays 50 percent of a veteran's starling 
wageuptolio.ooo." 

To qualify, a Korean Conflict or Vietnam Era veteran must have been unem- 
ployed for at least IS of the K) weeks prior lo tiling an application The maximum 
training period Is nine months or up to IS months for disabled veterans with a 
serious employment handicap

consideration to classes which require 
e pedal equipment that must be moved 
In nnd out of the classroom . 

"We will not set aside a certain 
number of rooms that won't be used al 
prime limes to force teachers to teach 
classes at less busy times, " Dahl said. 

Dahl's policy does not solve the 
problem of classrooms cot being 
available to teachers and students 
during certain busy times of the day. 

"As long as we nave the desire to 
teach more classes than we have 
rooms available, we will have a 
problem," he aald. "The university 
doesn't always have enough rooms 
1 available." 

Room utilization studies are Im- 
portant to IPFW. said Dahl, since they 
are a key factor in justify ing Ihe need 
for additional space. When the 
Classroom and Medical and 
Multipurpose buildings were 
authorized, IPFW had the highest 
room utilization of any campus in 
Indiana. Further expansion at IPFW 
may hinge partly on the need by the 
University for

EPFW, Ihrough Purdue University, 
had asked far approval by the Indiana

October meeting, tbe HEC turned 
down the request as a priority Hem. 

Gorney and Harris gave the students 
two reasons why they think Ihe requesl

economy lo high technology. The 
second is General Motor's decision lo

Marital Status, question of privacy 



By ANGELA FRANCE 
Chler Reporter 

A young man approached Ihe 
registration table la have a red "O.K." 
stamped on his not-quile complete 
registration card. 

"You didn't mark your marital 
status," said the woman at the table 
with ihe little rubber slamp. 

"That's not really important is it?" 



"We receive a number of objections 
each semester to that question on 
grounds of personal privacy," said 
JackC. Dahl, registrar. 

Dahl himself had questioned the 
need for such Information, but when 
registrars from Indiana met as a 
group to determine the need for the 
marital status question, they decided 11 
could not be eliminated, despite some 
people's sensitivity to ihe queslionand 
concern for their privacy. 



The stallstics oblalne 



Dahl said ihe Information cai 
fluence the kinds of student activ 
organized by Sludenla' Govemme 



"The Registrar's Office is not in- 
terested In that degree of detail." said 
Dahl "Therc'sarespeclfarprivacyof 
students lhat says we can serve our 
purposes in collecting data without 
having to over-Intrude on their 
privacy " 



Dahl said Ihe registrar's office has a 
two-fold response for students con- 
cerned about their privacy. First, the 
statistics being gathered are suf- 
ficient ly Important to warrant 
gathering them, and second, only a 
minimal amount of 1 
being collected 



Students worried about 
access to such personal It 
need not be, Dahl said. For example, 
when a transcript is sent to an em- 
ployer, marital status does not appear 
on It. The only information available to 
anyone oulaldc the university la 
classified as directory Information and 
includes such tilings as name, address, 
dates attended, birthdate and 
telephone number. Among those 
items, the birthdate, address and 
telephone number can be eliminated

Students taking classes offered by the 
IPFW fine arU department must aliend 
classes in Fori Wayne's hislertc West 
Central Neighborhood, while students 
attending classes offered by other IPFW 
departments attend classes ai the main 
campus. 

While the facilities on the main 
campus are far from perfect, the 
facilities the Tine oris department oc- 
cupies make the main campus look like 
thv ureatesl ulace on eorlh. 

The current fine arts facilities have 
been used since the 1920s, when the 
department was a separate entity. The 
department merged with IPFW in 1976, 
allowing students greater flexibility in 
their educational goals. However, with 
the department located about 5 miles 
from campus, students must commute 
from the fine arts department to the 
main campus to lake non-art classes. 

A new arts facility on IPFWs campus 



will benefit more than just the fine arts 
department. It will benefit all of north- 
eastern Indiana. The department will 
have enough studio space in a new 
facility to do the kind of painting, 
sculpting, photography and pottery for 
students to need to team their craft. 
Non-fine arts majors will also be 
likely to enroll in fine arts classes if they 
were offered on the main campus rather 
than on Berry Street. 

Northeastern Indiana needs the 
facility to improve its cultural image. 
Many people think of the Midwest as a 
cultural wasteland. A quality, first-class 
facility could help change people's 
perspective of the Midwest.

Prepare car for winter 




While Fort Wayne and northeastern 
Indiana have had less than an inch of 
snowfall and few days of sub-freezing 
weather, it isn't too early to think about 
winter safety and winter driving. 

Since IPFW is a commuter campus, 
almost everyone on campus drives to 
and from school, which makes winter 
safety important to just about all of us. 

The first thing we as drivers ignore, 
particularly at this time of year with the 
big end-of-the-semester surge un- 
derway, is preventive maintenance 
items on our cars, such as checking the 



Another thing we often forget is 
changing our driving habits from mild 
weather to winter weather. When the 
first major snowstorm hits, we often 
forget how difficult it is to stop 
and ice or how long it takes to get from 
home to school in the snow. 

Those of us driving this winter should 
remember to allow ourselves a little 
more time. We wouldn't want to miss an 
exam because we got stuck ir
