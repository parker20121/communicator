Helmke lacks funding, 
acquisitions falter 



By Mary Shrock 
Staff Writer 

IPFWs new on-line computer system 
is a topic that is being debated by 
those individuals involved with the 
library services division. While most 
people agree that the on-line system is 
a breaklhrough in interlibrary loans, 
there are those who (eel that the bud- 
gel should be concerned with getting 
new books in the IPFW library instead 
ol depending on other schools to sup- 
ply the books and articles, says Larry 
Griflin, director ot library services. 

Michael Downs, chair of the political 
science department, said, "When a 
library can't buy books, there is some- 
thing seriously wrong.' He said that 
the IPFW library budget should allow 
tor a larger allocation lor buying library 
books. 

The total library budget tor IPFW is

Campus closing announcement 
The director of university relations

'In the event the campus is closec

ecorded message available at 481 
6050. 

When possible, decisions about

evening classes and by 6:30 a.m. for 
day classes. 

Individuals on campus will be 
asked to leave and to remove thei 
vehicles so parking lots may be 
cleared. 
II no announcement is made 
ssume the campus is open. 
Because IPFW serves a large 
region, weather conditions In differ- 
ent areas may not be the same a; 
those al the campus. Ultimately, it is 
Ihe student's responsibility to deter- 
mine the potential risks involved if 
there are hazardous driving condi- 
tions.* 



$989,599 which goes towards the 
salary of Ihe librarians, the purchase of 
books and equipment lor the library, 
and supplies and expense. The 
amount in the total budget lor acquisi- 
tion of books and serials goes up 
annually, but if the budget does not 
increase by at least 10 percent each 
year to meet the growing prices that 
new books and serials demand, then 
something will have to give way. 
Namely the purchasing of books for 
student use. says Griflin. 

A committee, made up of eight repre- 
senatives Irom various academic 
departments, recommends how much 
money should be allocated for book 
and serial lunding. Richard Ritchie, 
vice chancellor ol financial affairs, said 
lhat the University is suffering from the 
lack ol money available for the library 
budge! and lhat in order to live wilhin 
the limit, there must be some mea- 
sures faken to accommodate the prob- 
lem ol borrowing instead ol purchasing 
books. 

Griffin staled that undergraduate 
needs come first. "We need to buy 
books, journals, and indexes lhat our 
students need in the library now. The 
faculty will need to rely on on-line more 
and more." 

Much of the opposition to current 
funding procedure involves the com- 
paratively smaller percentage that is 
being allocated toward the purchase o! 
new books. Griffin, answering the 
complaints, said, "This is the year 
we've decided not to do it anymore 
(the buying of costly serials). It has 
gone loo far." 

For the 1991-1992 school year, 
$304,025 was allocated for the pur- 
chase ot books in addition lo founda- 
tion money from an endowment equal- 
ing $62,000. Ninety percent of the 
lotal amount is spent on serials which 
need to be constantly updated. 




IPFW All-Amerlcan candidate, Lisa Miller, scored 32 points and dished 
out five assists against Wayne State In her last outing. Miller Is a senior 
elementary education major who currently holds 12 IPFW career, sea- 
son, and game records.

Kinko's case impacts printing practices 



By Tina Holston 
Editor In Chief 
A recent precedent setting copy- 
right infringement suit decision 
against Kinko's Graphics Corpora- 
tion brings into question the practice 
by both commercial and university 
copycenters of producing antholo- 
gies for use in the classroom, 

The decision in the suit against 
Kinko's does not deal with faculty or 
university copying; however, faculty 
and university copy centers must also 
lollow copyright laws governing copy- 
ing for educational uses. 

In the suit, the publishers, with the 
guidance of the American Associa- 
tion ol Publishers, sued a commer- 
cial copying chain that had profited 
from selling publishers' copyrighted 
works without obtaining permission. 
The copyshop in this case had 
solicited faculty business and falsely 
assured the faculty that copyright 
compliance was being handled. 

The AAP said thoy believe that facul- 
ty and school administrations have 
been sensitive to the copyright law and 
have widely followed the Congression- 
al^ endorsed "Classroom Guidelines 
on Copying in Not -for- Prof it Education- 
al Institutions," published by the AAP. 

The Irial record showed clearly that 
many college stores are already oper- 
ating legitimate custom publishing 
operations where Ihey oblain permis- 
sion and make authorized anthologies. 
At IPFW, Printing Services makes 
several such anthologies and other 
reprinted materials for distribution in 
Follett's Bookstore every year, said 
Karen Ruhl, Printing Services 
administrator. 

'We require a letter of permission 
Irom the publisher before we will repro- 
duce copyrighted materials." she said. 

However, Ruhl also said that she 
fears that some professors could be 
sending copyrighted materials lo her 
without her knowing it. 

"H's scary, someone could jusl type 
verbatim from a book or article and 
how are we to know it? I'm sure we 
have inadvertently printed some copy- 
righted materials." she said. "Some 
things will slip through the cracks.* 

Gary Brantley, textbook manager of 
Follett's, said that most of what is sold 
through Follell's are lab books and 
supplementary lexis written by the pro- 
fessor ol the course, but some antholo- 
gies are sold there as well. Brantley 



said he gets many questions from fac- 
ulty on what the copyright laws are 
governing textbooks. 

"I get a lot of questions from profes- 
sors who want to know it they can copy 
something, mostly on out of print 
books," said Brantley. 

There are a lot of them lhal just don't 
know what the rules are," he said. 

Brantley said he tells them to get 
legal advise because he said he is not 
sure of the copyrighl laws eilher. 

Copyright protection is available for 
works created on or after Jan. 1, 1978; 
protection begins at creation and lasts 
unlil 50 years after the author's death. 
Alter copyright is expired, the work 
becomes part o! the public domain and 
copies can be made without permis- 
sion or payment of royalties. 

Ruhl said many of the materials 
copied by Printing Services are legal 
under lair use* laws. The rules which 
apply to copying materials for educa- 
tional purposes are wilhin the Copy- 
right Act of 1976. 

The Doctrine of Fair Use permits the 
use ol copyrighted materials in limited 
situations, including reprinting the 
material withoul the copyright holder's 
permission. Section 107 of the Copy- 
right Ad states lour basis factors to be 
considered in determining whether a 
use constitutes "fair use" under copy- 
right law. These factors are as follows: 
the purpose and character of use, 
including whether such use is ol com- 
mercial or non-profit educational pur- 
poses; the nature of Ihe copyrighted 
material; the amount and substantiality 
ot the portion ot work used in relation 
to the copyrighted work as a whole; 
and the effect of the use in question 
upon Ihe potential market for or value 
of the copyrighted work. 

According to the guidelines published 
oy Ihe AAP, no one (actor is determina- 
tive of a person's right to use a copy- 
righted work without permission. It 
specifically states lhal educational use 
alone is not sufficient lo make a use in 
question a fair one. 

The guidelines for making multiple 
copies without permission for academic 
use contain the following prohibitions: 
unauthorized copying may not be used 
to create, replace or substitute antholo- 
gies, compilations or collective works, 
whether or not such unauthorized 
copies are collected and bound togeth- 
er or are provided separately; unautho- 
rized copies may not be made of "con- 



University financing 

Tight budget 
could mean 
fee 



increase 



By Tammy Rasnlck 
News Editor 

Students will most likely see another 
fee increase next semester due lo Ihe 
constraining budget, according to 
Richard Ritchie, Vice Chancellor of 
Financial Affairs. The increase will 
likely be similar lo Ihe 8% increase 
seen this semester. 

The necessity to raise studenl lees 
has risen from the light budget that 
state legislators passed last June. 
According lo Ritchie. IPFW's proposed 
budget was close lo $3.3 million, but 
the amount that the state appropriated 
was less than 30% of that figure. The 
state appropriated $1.5 million lor 
IPFWs budget. 

IPFW works on a two-year budget so 
the problem will not be solved any time 
soon. In fact, Ritchie stated that going 
into the second year of Ihe budget, 
IPFW will be $300,000 short of the 
funds needed for operation ot the Uni- 
versity. 



In response to the budget constraints, 
it will be necessary to make adjust- 
ments. "We will need to live within the 
budget. We will be doing il with a con- 
servative approach," Ritchie said. 
"Each major department had to cut 
costs by more lhan $330,000." 

The area that felt Ihe pinch ol the 
budget the most was salaries, accord- 
ing lo Ritchie "Purdue has choose to 
adopt a conservative salary policy, but 
has also decided not to pass on medi- 
cal costs to employees." 

According to Ritchie, the budget 
problems are Ihe delayed effects from 
the national recession. 

Ritchie expressed his concerns about 
the University's inability to offer com- 
petitive salaries to professors. If this 
continues professors are likely lo seek 
employment elsewhere in order to get 
competitive salary. "Next year we plan 
to get back to a normal merit-based 
salary plan to prevent the loss of our 
quality professors." Ritchie said. 



IPFW 1991-92 budget proposed to 
state legislature: 



sumable" works, including work- 
books, exercises, standardized 
tesls, test booklets and answer 
sheets, and the like; unauthorized 
copying may not substitute for the 
purchase of books, publisher's 
reprints or periodicals; the same 
teacher cannot copy the same item 
without permission from term to 
term; no charge shall be made to the 
student beyond actual cost of the 
photocopying. 

The Copyrighl Act also has no auto- 
malic exemption lor making even one 
unauthorized personal copy of a copy- 
righted work. But the fair use guide- 
lines provide lhat a teacher may make 
a single copy, for scholarly research or 
for use in leaching or preparing to 
teach a class, of the following works: a 
chapter of a book; an article from a 
periodical; a short story, essay or short 
poem; or a chart, graph, drawing, dia- 
gram, cartoon, or picture from a book 
or periodical. 

In Ihe appendix lo the guidelines, def- 
initions are given to clarify acceptable 
classroom use under the fair use doc- 
trine. According to the guidelines, mul- 
tiple copies (not to exceed one per 
pupil) may be made provided that the 
copying meets the tests of brevity and 
each copy includes a notice of copy- 
right. The guidelines define brevity for 
the use of poetry as less than 250 
words, for prose as less than 2,500 
words or not more lhan 10 percent of 
Ihe entire work for longer works, and 
for illustrations only one per publication 
may be used. 

The AAP said in its slatement of Ihe 
Kinko's suit decision lhat "copyright 
exists to foster and Induce the creation 
of all forms of intellectual property 
Including books. It does so by provid- 
ing fair returns to creators and copy- 
righl owners. 

"To the extent that copyshops make 
and sell anthologies without permis- 
sion, or portions ol copyrighted books, 
authors and publishers are deprived of 
revenues in the very market for which 
they have written and published. That 
severely reduces the Incentive lo write 
and publish these books. 

"In the long run, permitting that 
kind of free-riding will harm educa- 
tion, because investments of time 
and money in new books will simply 
not be made if such books will be 
copied by others without payment to 
copyright owners." 




New Programs 



State's allocation to IPFW for 1991-92:

Campus expansion unhindered 
by lack of money from state 



Five new buildings are being built on 
campus recently With budgeting prob- 
lems being faced by universities across 
the nation, it would seem that the funds 
for building new facilities would be 
lacking. 

The budget that the state appropri- 
ates to IPFW, however, is noi the fund- 
ing line used lo construct the new 
buildings. The budget lhat the Univesi- 
ty operates on Is used for several 
areas, such as supplies, student assis- 
tance programs, quality improvements, 
new programs and personal services. 
The budget is a fixed amounl where 
the funds for the new buildings are 
more flexible. IPFW is granted authori- 
ty by Ihe stale lo sell bonds. This 
allows Ihe University to solicit the funds 
necessary for the buildings. A small 
amount ol Ihe funding for some of Ihe 
buildings did come from a university 



reserve fund. 

Each of Ihe buildings were separalely 
funded. The parking garage cost of 
4.8 million was solely funded by stu- 
dent parking fees and tines. 

The 4.6 million for the Fine Arts Build- 
ing was funded out of campus 
reserves. The Purdue-Indiana Threatre 
which will cost 4.7 million was also 
partly lunded by campus reserves, with 
the majority of the funds coming from 
gift monies. 

There is a clear difference between 
the money used lor operating the Uni- 
versity and the funds used for Ihe new 
buildings. Although the University will 
have to struggle with the budget, sepa- 
rate funding for Ihe construction of new 
buildings allows them lo look to the 
future and build the new facilities. This 
attracts more students and in turn will 
create more money for Ihe University 
operaling budget.

HIV virus yields 
two different tales 

Two very different men, two very different professions, and the 
same disease. 

Magic Johnson, of the National Basketball Association's Los 
Angeles Lakers, and Freddie Mercury from FM radio favorites, 
Queen. Both were considered to be masters of their crafts. 

Johnson won three NBA MVP awards, while leading the Lakers 
to live championships. Not only is he the NBA's all-time assist 
leader, but he was pure hell on the fast break. 

Mercury's disciplined, piercing tenor defined Queen's hard rock 
sound. Queen's rock was a remarkable balance of pompous and 
playful. Rock fans know and love Mercury's songs: "Bohemian 
Rhapsody," "We Will Rock You/We Are the Champions," "Killer 
Queen," "Somebody to Love," "Another One Bites the Dust," 
"Under Pressure." 

Johnson was a multimillionaire. Mercury was a multimillionaire. 
They both lived lives on the road. Both had opportunities for a lot 
of sex, with a lot of different people. Both contracted the HIV virus. 

On Nov. 12 Johnson went public with the news. People across 
the world were stunned. Even those not so awed with his ball- 
playing prowess were won over by his charm, and they, too, were 
amazed. 

Johnson was quick to make the story a "positive" one. He was 
quitting basketball to work for AIDS awareness and research. He 
reassured Arsenio that he contracted the HIV virus through hetero- 
sexual contact only. He told Sports Illustrated readers that he's 
always been susceptible to the lure of women. 

Media coverage of Johnson's infection has been intensive for 
weeks. He's been hailed a brave man. Johnson's been a hero to 
kids and fans for years, and he's still performing like a champion in 
front of the news lights. 

News of Mercury's infection came just three days later. Classic 
rock deejays played some tribute songs. He received some notice 
on the nightly newscasts. Virtually all said the same thing: Mer- 
cury was long rumored to have AIDS. 

Mercury never got the chance to speak lor himself, though, He 
was already bedridden with full-blown AIDS. Inside of two weeks, 
he succumbed. 

Loose talk of Mercury's alleged homosexuality has been around 
since Queen first hit the radio in the 70s. 

Somehow that didn't matter when the band was the hit of the 
1985 Rock in Rio festival, making 110.000 people pump their fists 
in unison. Or to the two million fans who own a copy of "Queen's 
Greatest Hits." 

Mercury died of AIDS, but two million mourners couldn't be 
heard. 



Former senator apologizes 
for Phil's mix up 



To ihe Editor: 

In response lo a letter from Greg 
Willson, in regards lo the student dis- 
count package, I would like lo make n 
known lhat I was responsible for the 
1991 package. All thai we, as Ihe stu- 
dent government, could do was lo 
appeal to local businesses (o help our 
students financially however possible, 
in return for the students' patronage, 

We must therefore assume if they 
return a contract they are sincere in 
their discount offer. II the owner of 
Phil's Hobby Shop chose to play word 

IPSGA watch 



games between "retail price" and Teg- 
ular price," I must apologize. But I 
hardly feel responsible because the 
owner wasn't sincere when he said he 
would help the students. If you would 
like to Greg, you can sue the owner of 
Phil's for breech of contract, although I 
hardly think it would be worth your time 
and effort for $36. II you do choose, 
however, to sue, see the student gov- 
ernment and trie contract will be made 
available to you.

Letters to The Editor 



Cannon commends, corrects paper on AIDS story 



To the Editor: 

As a member of the IPFW AIDS Infor- 
mation Committee, and Secretary of 
the Board of Directors of the AIDS 
Task Force, Inc., I want to commend 
you for drawing attention to AIDS in 
your front page articles Oct. 24 and 
Nov. 7. You presented a lot ol informa- 
tion, information that could save lives. I 
hope you will continue (o publicize 
HIV/AIDS, You can reach many more 
students than the AIDS Information 
Committee can, 

I feel it necessary to correct some ol 
the inlormation in your Nov. 7 article. 
You slated lhat HwPworld Health 
Organization putsjhe number of con- 
firmed AIDS cases worldwide at 
200,000 with 140,000 of those in the 
United Stales." The figures are higher 
than that. To date, there have been 
about 197,000 cases ol AIDS reported 
in the United States atone, and more 
than 125,000 ol those are deceased. 

Though you didnt give any figures on 
the size ol the epidemic locally, h is a 
serious problem. The AIDS Task 
Force, Inc., which has served northeast 
Indiana since 1965. has worked with 
more than 300 people who are infect- 
ed. Most of those people are from Fort 



Wayne and Allen County. More than 
100 of (hem have died. These figures 
are higher than those provided by the 
Indiana State Board of Health because 
the Board of Health only counts cases 
that were diagnosed here. The 300 
included people who were diagnosed 
here as well as those who were diag- 
nosed elsewhere but who have 
returned to Fort Wayne lo be wilh fami- 
ly and friends during their illness. 

In the Nov. 7 article you talked about 
"greatest risk ol infection, according lo 
American Red Cross." You left out one 
vital piece of Information; receptive 
anal intercourse with someone infected 
with HIV is one of the riskiest practices 
of all. The person receiving HlV-inlecl- 
ed semen in his or her rectum is at 
very greal risk lor infection. 

I also want to comment on your edito- 
rial in the Oct. 24 issue in which you 
criticize the campus AIDS policy. For 
one thing, the policy has been in exis- 
tence since 1989. It is not a 'new AIDS 
policy created this year" as your editori- 
al stated. It was published in the stu- 
dent handbook in the hope of making 
students aware ol it. The policy applies 
not just lo students bul also to faculty 



and staff. You describe (he policy as 
"vague." I prefer to think of it as broad. 
Most large companies in Fort Wayne, 
such as Indiana Michigan Power, Sum- 
mit Bank and others have a published 
AIDS policy. IPFW's policy is similar to 
those others except that it covers stu- 
dents as well as employees. 

Organizations developed AIDS poli- 
cies to protect infected individuals irom 
being discriminated against by other 
employees, to avoid the situation 
where a group of employees go to their 
supervisor saying they refuse to work 
with another employee because lhat 
person has AIDS or HIV Infection. One 
of the main ideas of the IPFW policy is 
in its statement, "an infected person 
does not endanger others by remaining 
in class, laboratories, clinical settings, 
student organizations, or work environ- 
ments.' Being in class with an infected 
student, or staff or faculty member 
does not endanger you. I have heard it 
said lhat if you get AIDS at work, you're 
doing something at work you're not 
being paid (or. That could be para- 
phrased to apply to class. 

Businesses can and do require their 
employees to attend training sessions 



on AIDS IPFW cannot require stu- 
dents lo attend such sessions, so we 
attempt to make students aware ol 
your policy in other ways, such as pub- 
licizing it in ihe Student Handbook. 

Your articles are also very helpful in 
publicizing this issue and I speak lor 
the committee when I say thank you. 

One last comment on the composition 
ol the committee, which you criticized. 
The names of committee members, 
with the exception ol the name ol the 
student member, are published in the 
policy. The policy applies to University 
employees as well as students, so it is 
necessary that the personnel director 
and the vice chancellor lor student 
affairs be members. Since the chancel- 
lor has responsibility for the authority 
over this campus, it is appropriate that 
she appoint a member of her stall, the 
executive director of university rela- 
tions. Because of our long-time 
involvement with the AIDS Task Force 
and our work in this Held, Prolessor 
Linda Graham and I can contribute our 
knowledge ol HIV/AIDS to the commit- 
lee. Student input is welcome.

Student offers his side 



To the Editor: 

Regarding your editorial dated Nov 
21, 1991, i am the student in question 
in the matler ol Ihe impeachment ol 
Sally Green, and I have a bone lo pick 
with you. Yes, it is true I am a SAB 
member, but no where in the constitu- 
tion does it say that being a part of this 
organization lakes away my right as a 
student to representation. For the 
record Ihe writlen request for inlorma- 
tion was not intergovernmental (it was 
not written on SAB stationery). It did 
not even have anything to do with Ihe 
Student Activities Board. 

I strongly suggest that the next time 
you lei everybody know your opinion 
that it be an inlormed one. To this point 
I quote your editorial, 'The person 



whom she told to 'get a life' was a SAB 
member, a colleague ol Green's not a 
constituent. As 1 slated earlier I am a 
constitueni as I am a student at this 
school with the right to vote in elec- 
tions! The constitution tor IPSGA does 
not suspend these rights just because 
a student becomes a member of it. 

Being a member of IPSGA, I have 
heard a lot of complaining about stu- 
dent apathy. I can understand the apa- 
thy a little better now as a student who 
tried to take a part in an issue that he 
found out about by sitting in a senate 
meeting. The issue was asbestos in 
ihe library lounge. This is only of mild 
importance as my questions were final- 
ly answered by the administration.

To the Editor: 

You missed the polnll You lost the

your Letters section. 

The major point that you missed in

Due process is the diflerence

and a fair trial with legal representa- 



tion and a jury of one's peers. They

IPFW Senator 
Nancy C. Barger 



Writer blasts actions, policies of student government 



To the Editor: 

The shake-up in student government 
that was requested earlier this year is 
happening, and all IPFW students 
beware. 

Two weeks ago impeachment 
charges were brought up against three 
studenl senators for fraud, dishonesty, 
thett and failure lo represent con- 
stituency. Although I mighl agree that 
at least one ol these senators can be 
abrasive. I hardly believe these 'seri- 
ous crimes" (smoking in restricted 
areas, using computers to write letters, 
or commenls such as "you better watch 
your back" and "should get a life") meril 
much punishment lei alone studenl 
government attention. 

Yes. Internal Affairs is delinttely shak- 
ing up Ihe government. After admitting 
lo beginning ihe impeachment process 



themselves, Interna! Affairs took its 
reports to Sludent Activities Board, 
another branch of student government. 
In light of Ihe "seriousness" ol ihese 
crimes, Scott Beineke ol Internal Aflalrs 
conducted his investigation in secrel, 
only informing Ihe accused after he 
sent letters revoking their rights as sen- 
ators and demanding Ihe return ot all 
IPSGA materials. 

Did Internal Affairs try lo lind a solu- 
tion lo this before bringing it to trial as 
described in Roberts Rules of Order, 
the sludent government guidebook? 
No, they even tailed to ask the sena- 
tors il Ihey said, or what was meant by 
•gel a IHe* or "watch your back." 

On Sunday, Nov. 10, Internal Allairs 
walked out of a student senate meet- 
ing, not only refusing lo answer ques- 
tions but Ihey also ended the meeting 



only 10 minutes after it started by 
breaking quorum. The bias of Internal 
Affairs in this matter is obvious. 

In order to set a trial date, a special 
meeting of the entire IPSGA must be 
called. This was drne by Student Body 
President Kristina Frazier-Henry the 
very next night with less than 24 yours 
nolice. In fact, Frazier-Henry had asked 
the accused senators when Ihey could 
meet and all three said not on Monday. 
So Monday night a meeting was held 
with an allotted fifteen minute time limit. 
During Ihe first ten minutes, Mike Will 
ol Internal Affairs read off all charges of 
specification of impeachment. A vole 
was Ihen laken lo proceed wilh the 
impeachment and the meeting was 
ended, no discussion, 

I now submit Inserts from Frazier- 
Henry's letter lo Ihe editor of Fori 



Wayne Newspaper- " it's too bad that 
board member Joe McComb had lo put 
his personal agenda ahead of the stu- 
dents of Fort Wayne. To demand Ihe 
resignation ol Superintendent William 
Coats was silly and childish. I am 24 
years old, and I know thai an individual 
will never accomplish anything produc- 
tive by making Ihese kinds ot demands. 
Mr. McComb. il you felt he was wrong 
about the re-organization of his admin- 
istration, then you should have con- 
structively pointed out the faults 
Threatening to have Mr. Coats 
removed as superintendent just further 
proves that you are a ruthless individu- 
al who shouldn't be representing the 
taxpayers.* Is this Ihe same Krisiina 
Frazier-Henry? If so. her actions should 
try lo coincide a little more with her 
words. 
Yet the shake-up continues. A Sen- 



ate Standing Rules bill, sponsored by 
Frazier-Henry, Beineke, John Weisen- 
burger, vice president of studenl legis- 
lature, et al, was passed last Sunday. 

This bill included at least two ques- 
tionable rules. The first may seem rea- 
sonable on ils lace. It slates that writ- 
ten proxy voles may be accepted. 
These are written votes for a bill lor 
members who cannot attend the meet- 
ing. The problem Is most all bills are 
revised just prior lo voting. A bill allo- 
cating $50.00 to a committee may raise 
Ihe amount to $500 00 before vote. 
Riders are often added or clauses can 
take the opposite meanings first 
expressed. A proxy vote may still be 
used alter amendments even il the bill 
no longer represents ils original form. 

Another clause in this bill is straight 
and lo the point. "Senate shall cast a 



secret ballot on all petitioners to sen- 
ale." Is this in order lo keep ihe senate 
a select club? Do you have lo be In the 
"In" crowd to be allowed to join? U.S. 
Senators cannot impeach those Ihey 
do not like or set rules to vote on any 
new members. Neither should IPFW. 

Yes, IPSGA has been shaken-up. bul 
is this the direction we want to go? 
Does this police state have any restric- 
tions? Who is to stop the Internal 
Affairs Commitlee, Ihe strong arm of 
the sludenl government from expelling 
students in the future. I urge all stu- 
dents, stall and faculty to look inlo 
these allegations. I once thought of 
joining student government bul it this is 
what ihey are allowed and expected to 
do, they are a group I feel no identity 
with.

The proposed cast is much younger 
than Ihe real characters in this drama, 
but (he USA people said the change is 
a must because the movie is being 
made lo appeal to Ihe high school and 
college-age sel. Kirk Cameron ol 
"Growing Pains" will be playing Scotl 
Beineke, the hard-working chairman of 
the sludent alfairs committee. Former 
"Facts of Life" star Mindy Cohn will play 
embattled senator Nancy Barger. 
Brandon from "Beverly Hills 90210" will 
play senator Mark Snyder. And Sally 
Green will be portrayed by lormer 
"Family Ties" star Justine Bateman. 



Who is going to play the grizzled, 
whiskey-slugging newspaper man who 
covers the story? Webster! 

Here is a sneak preview scene from 
the movie, exclusive lo IPFW students. 

Setting: In The Communicator build- 
ing, in Jim Walker's office with big win- 
dows looking over Ihe busy city streets. 
Barger comes storming into Ihe office. 
Walker is leaning back in his big, over- 
stuffed leather chair, feet on desk. He's 
wearing a dark Italian suit. He's smok- 
ing a big cigar and slugging whiskey. 
Barger speaks first 

Barger: I'm innocent, (pause) I never 
said a thing. They set me upl (irate) 

Walker: You're a bad liar baby. It's

And it goes on like that. 

So look for "Halls ol Deception" or 
"Students on the Bbck" (vory lenlative 
titles) coming soon as a USA World 
Premiere Movie. 

THAT'S IT - So we come lo the end

Metallica plays at Coliseum; fans witness loud, crazed show 



By Chad Hestlng 
Features Editor 

Three summers ago I went to see 
Metallica at the Expo Center. It was a 
male bonding experience. Everyone 
that wenl was male, and it was so hot 
that everyone stuck together. 

A great sweaty time was had by all, 
a ten on the dude scale. Singer and 
guitarist James Hatfield's sneer was 
firmly in place. Bassist Jason Newsted 
whipped his hair around his head like a 
lasso. Kids pushed toward the stage 
so they could get crushed harder than 
Ihey were ten leet away. The maitre'd 
wouldn't let you in without a black T- 
shirt and black jeans. 

Speed or weed marked the differ- 
ence between standing and silling. 
Stand up on the lop bleacher and you 
were treated to the sight of 4,000 
heads o! hair, a lurry mass thrashing in 
lime to the thunder. 

Last Monday's show was going to 
be different. I knew. Metallica has sold 
several kazillion records since then, 
and their pockmarked mugs compete 
with Mariah Carey's lor MTV airtime. 

That stuff doesm bother me; good 
music should be spread around like the 
flu. I just feared a tame show. I had 
nightmares of backup singers on the 
stage ('Ladies and gentleman, The 
Metallicettes"}, or a floor full of motion- 
less cheerleaders and nice guys 
("Julian, that Neanderthal just danced 
on my foot. I lost the penny out of my 
loafers."). 

Fortunately, the Nov. 25 show was 
nothing like that. The Sheriff's special 
Heavy-Metal Deployment Force slowed

the ticket queue to a crawl, frisking 
miniskirted girls for contraband, The 
line curved from the Coliseum Boule- 
vard entrance all the way to the south 
end of the Expo Center, in windy 20- 
degree weather. Maybe I could have 
been called one of the smart ones. I 
braved frostbite with a llannel shin on, 
but most were drunk and macho and 
clad in their concert tees. 

A half hour in the November night, 
with the Arctic wind freezing that Slayer 
decal to your chest ... yikes. The Sher- 
ifl's deputies got called many names, 
most concerning unnatural acts with 
barnyard animals. 

Once inside (alter slapping some 
color into Iheir numbed arms) everyone 
shuffled past the vendors' tables to 
assess Ihe Metallica gear for sale. 

The recession has obviously hit 
clothes makers hard. A Metallica tee 
now costs more than a Metallica show 
by $4. Picture the hard-luck shirt huck- 
ster and his malnourished family. 

"Dear," his wife pleads, "there's no 
food in Ihe cupboard." 

"You're righl," he says. "I'll raise Ihe 
'Metallica Rules' hankie to S25 tomor- 
row. 

The crowd inside the Coliseum defi- 
nitely looked different than the Metalli- 
ca crowd of old. There were real live 
women there. 01 their own Iree will. 
Not just trailing their boyfriends in only 



to get moshed around and body- 
passed over the crowd. 

No matter how stripped-down and 
chest-beating masculine Metallica has 
made heavy metal, women still fol- 
lowed the music Ihere. Metal never 
stays a boys' dub lor long. Everyone 
wants to dance. 

The music was all I paid for. 
Newsted started the rolling bass riff 
that moves "Enter Sandman," and 
everyone howled. Surprisingly, 
Metallica had some trouble in the 
lirst few songs. The spoken "Our 
Father" lines in 'Sandman" were not 
in time with the drumbeats. 

All four players seemed a bit stow 
and tired in general, especially Hellield. 
Hetlield even saw fit to flip off Ulrich lor 
some unseen offense during "Creeping 
Death." 

The crowds enthusiasm never 
slacked, though. Newsted and Ulrich 
led off some of that energy, and soon

all four were juiced up. 

The band took obvious pleasure in 
offering older songs, and acknowledg- 
ing that most everyone in the audience 
knew them. They encouraged fans to 
sing (bellow) along wilh 'Four Horse- 
men" and "For Whom the Bell Tolls.* 
By that time their T-shirts were as 
sweaty as their listeners. 

Lovers of the new Metallica record 
made the difference between tilling Ihe 
Expo Center and filling the Coliseum, 
though. The crowd could be heard 
singing over Hetfield's voice on "Sad 
but True* and "The Unforgiven." Metal- 
lica smiled at the reaction the new 
songs got, and Ihe thrashing near the 
front of the stage was furious. 

A respectful circle formed in Ihe 
back for the slammers. You could 



gauge the slammers' love lor the songs 
by the speed ol their banging. Before 
the opening line of "Green Hell" was 
out ol Hetfield's mouth, "I got some- 
thing to say ...," the pit was a spinning 
ring of arms and stomping boots. 

All was cool inside there, though. 
We kept things respectful, il slamming 
can be called that. Some girls joined 
in, and only a lew slammers got 
knocked on their backs. 

Metallica has to be applauded for 
Iheir democratic staging, loo. Fans on 



all sides ot Ihe diamond-shape stage 
got to see all lour players. They 
switched mikes around Ihe stage for 
every song. Even Ulrich's drum riser 
rotated around the stage to give the 
fans a good look. 

"One" was the last encore, leaving 
everyone hoarse and exhausted. The 
crowd tiled out, tapping Iheir ears lo 
shake that ringing noise. Catching the 
eye of Ihe usher, I tossed him a salute. 

"See you for Ozzy," he said back.

Miller leads Lady 'Dons down winning path 



By Mark Donaldson 
Sports Editor 

The IPFW women's basketball (earn 
split two games on the road belore rid- 
ing a 61-point socond half to win its 
home opener. 

On Nov. 22, the Lady 'Dons kicked olf 
new coach Eileen Kleinfelter's first sea- 
son with a 62-46 win over Aquinas Col- 
lege. The Saints entered the contest 
ranked 14th in NAIA Division II. 

Junior center Pam Edwards led IPFW 

i with 18 points, hrttting 7-ot-12 tram the 

field and all four of her free throws. 

Edwards also grabbed seven 



rebounds, had five steals and two 
blocks in 39 minutes ol play. Senior 
Lisa Miller chipped in 16 points to go 
with 14 rebounds, and sophomore 
Michelle Conley scored 10 points and 
pulled down six rebounds. 

Aquinas was led by center Symantha 
Reenders' 17 points and 12 rebounds. 
The Saints were held to 21-of 67 field 
goal shooting including 1-o!-9 from the 
three-point line. 

The following night host Oakland 
University overcame Miller's 38-point 
performance to down IPFW 65-73. 
The Lady Pioneers' victory avenged a 



87-86 loss in Fort Wayne last season. 

To reach her leam-record point total 
Miller hit 18-ol-19 tree throws and 10- 
of-21 shots Irom the field. She also led 
the loam with four steals, grabbed sev- 
en rebounds and dished out three 
assists. Edwards had 10 rebounds to 
go with eight points, and junior Tina 
Menier scored nine points while pass- 
ing out two assists. 

Four Lady Pioneers scored in double 
iigures led by Stacy Lamphere's 24 
points. Oakland launched 34 three- 
point shots hitting 12. 

In their first home game ol the sea- 




son, the Lady 'Dons rallied from a 46- 
39 halttime deficit to beat Wayne Stale 
University 100-88 on Nov. 27. 

With IPFW up 19-17. the Tartars' 
Julie Filpus, a 5-fooI-7-inch sophomore 
guard, hit two shots in the lane to key a 
10-0 scoring run. When Ihe flurry end- 
ed Wayne Slale led 27-19 with just 
over eight minutes left in the half. 

The Lady 'Dons chipped away at the 
lead, cutting it lo 46-39 when freshman 
Jamie LaRue stole the ball and look il 
end-to-end scoring wilh 20 seconds 
remaining. 

Sophomore Dawn Dressier cut the 
lead to five jusl nine seconds into the 
second half but MoniqUe Johnson's 
jumper and a three-point shot Irom 
6eth Wilson stretched Ihe Tartars' lead 
lo 10 at the 19:10 mark. 

With IPFW trailing 59-51 with 15:25 
remaining in the game, Miller scored off 
a spin move in the painl to kick off a 
14-poinl scoring burst interrupted only 
by Filpus' three-pointer. 

The lead see-sawed until Menier put 
the Lady 'Dons up lor good on a 12- 
foot baseline jumper with just over four 
minutes logo. 

After senior Shelly Sands hit both 
ends of a one-and-one to put IPFW up 
91-81 at the 2:27 mark, Wayne Slate 
coach Gary Bryce took a time out. 
The move proved ineffeclive when the 
Tartars turned the ball over and junior 
Amy Hogan hit a three-pointer to

Vaughn's back 
to lead attack 



By Mark Donaldson 
Sports Editor 

Two Erics return9d (o their respeclivo 
teams recently with decidedly different 
results. Eric Dickerson returned lo ihe 
Inidanapolls Colts with negligible 
effect- Eric Vaughn's return lo the 
IPFW men's baskelball team coincided 
with a pair of convincing victories. 

Vaughn, a senior who sat ou1 a sea- 
son and a haH, led Ihe Mastodons to a 
season-opening home-court win over 
Hanover College, 81-54, on Nov. 25. 
He was perfect from Ihe field hitting 7- 
of-7, including both ol his three-point 
allempls and 3-of-3 free throws, for 19 
points. Vaughn also dished out three 
assisls and had two sleals with no 
lurnovers in just 15 minuies of play. 

Senior Duane Shears had 11 poinls, 
hilling 4-ol-5 field goals including all 
three of his three-point iries. Sopho- 
more Jeff Smrlhey had 10 poinls, junior 
Sean Gibson, also perlect from Ihe 
field and Iree-throw line, had nine 



poinls. and junior Ooug Reincke 
blocked five shots. 

Hanover, ranked 16th in NAIA Divi- 
sion II, was led by John Carler's 17 
points. 

The 'Dons boosted their record lo 2-0 
on Nov. 26 beating Hillsdale College 
88-73 on the road. The Chargers' 
"load and launch" offense misfired as 
they hit only 11-of-28ihree-poini shots. 

Vaughn again led IPFW with 19 
points, seven steals, and three assists. 
Senior Clarence Rich chipped in 16 
points and three steals. 

Also contributing for ihe 'Dons were 
Gibson with 11 poinls and live 
rebounds, Reincke with seven 
rebounds lo go with eight poinls. and 
junior John Honstreiter with 10 poinls. 

The Mastondons get a chance lo 
extend their winning streak when Ihey 
play host to Purdue-Calumet tonight at 
7:30 in the Athletic Center. They travel 
to Quincy College on Saturday to face 
the 0-5 Hawks.
