Constitutional 
review 
creates conflict 



By Abigail Horrom 
Staff Writer 



1 1 is noi a surprise ili.it organiza- 
tions on campus must comply (o 
IPFW regulations. The fact of ihe 
maiter is these organizations must 
follow regulations of the present 
time. 

Jeff Sterling, chair of Student 
Activities Commillee, explained the 
importance for the Student 
Government to stress that organiza- 
tions update their constitutions. 

"There have been organizations 
with constitutions that are still on 
the old Purdue system," Sterling 
said. "They still have clauses stat- 
ing their members must have a par- 
ticular GPA on a 6.0 scale to be a 
member." 

The Senate not only feels it is 
important for organizations to fol- 
low university guidelines, but they 
also believe it is important for them 
to follow the guidelines of today. 
Ten years from now, an organiza- 
tion may look back on its constitu- 
tion and see how things were dealt 
with in 1997 

The only problem that may 
occur is that a particular constitu- 
tion could be the same unchanged 
one. used in the 70s. 

A memorandum sent from the 
IPSGA Judicial Court to the mem- 
bers of IPSGA stated that an organi- 
zation is not considered inactive 
because (heir bylaws or constitution 
have not changed in the first six 
months. 

The presence or absence of this 
form in the Office of Student 
Activities indicates which organiza- 
tions are active and as well as those 
which are inactive. 

The role of IPSGA Senate 



Student Affairs Committee includes 
performing a review and making 
recommendations to the IPSGA 
Senate on constitutions of prospec- 
tive student organizations. 

"Two summers ago, only 
United Sexualilies and 
Intercollegiate Greek Council had 
met University guidelines," said 
Sterling. 

"Now, roughly half of the 
groups have updated their constitu- 
tion." 

Constitutional reviews are a 
very tedious process. The rules 
which must be followed by the gov- 
ernmental groups can be extensive. 

A few small conflicts have 
occurred relating to the constitu- 
tionality of the reviews performed 
by tbe IPSGA Senate Student 
Affairs Committee. 

According to Nick George, 
Chief Justice of IPSGA Judicial 
Court, they had been performing an 
"unconstitutional activity." 

"It was found that the IPSGA 
Senate Student Affairs Committee 
had become a bit overzealous in ful- 
filling its duty to determine active 
standing of student organizations," 
said George. 

"In light of the unconstitutional 
activity undertaken by the IPSGA 
Senate Student Affairs Committee, 
the Judicial Court recommended the 
constitutional review of all student 
organizations by the IPSGA Senate 
Student Affairs Committee be 
ceased forthwith," said George. 

As of right now, the role of the 
IPSGA Senate Student Affairs 
Committee includes perforating a 
review and only making recommen- 
dations to the IPSGA Senate on 
constitutions of prospective student 
organizations. 



Prof defends faculty 



By Noi Beckley 
Editor 

The speaker of the Purdue Fort 
Wayne Faculty senate defended fel- 
low professors who have recendy 
spoken publicly about their disatis- 
faction with the current atmosphere 
at IPFW 

James Hersberger, associate 
chair and associate professor of 
mathematical sciences, spoke out 
during Monday's monthly meeting 
of the faculty senate. 

Hersberger mentioned there 
have been stories in the papers and 
letters to the editor with one letter 
that appeared in Sunday's Journal 
Gazette characterizing some of the 



campus faculty as "malcontents " 

Hersberger also raised questions 
aboul the dual grievance procedures 
in place at IPFW. 

The university has one set of 
procedures from West I.afayetie and 
one from Bloomington. 

Hersberger warned Purdue fac- 
ulty to review carefully new proce- 
dure from Purdue before agreeing to 
it. 

The Purdue policy does not 
allow attorneys to attend grievance 
hearings. And Purdue President 
Steven Beering would not have to 
personally appear at any hearing. 

"I'm tired of (he administrative 
culture at Purdue," Hersberger said.

B0®®(°j fee? Seated plasma 
donors help give life to victims 



By Dodie Miller 
Chief Reporter 

Housed in a relatively non- 
nondescript budding at the cor- 
ner of Clay and Washington 
streets is the opportunity for 
healthy people to aid those less for- 
tunate 

Sera-Tec is a biologically 
based pharmaceutical company that 
specializes in locating and obtain- 
ing human donor plasma for biolog- 
ical manufacturers and pharmaceuti- 
cal companies. 

The donors' blood plasma is 
collected through a procedure called 
plasmapheresis. 

The plasma is then used to man- 
ufacture a variety of products for 
medical community. 

Sera- Tec is licensed and regu- 
lated by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) as well as 
certain state agencies. 

The medical assistance that 
Sera-Tec can provide cannot be 
gathered if eligible donors do not 
stop in and donate blood products. 

Sera-Tec has been a leading 
supplier of plasma to biological 
manufacturers and pharmaceutical 
companies for over twenty years 

The company has been in Fori 
Wayne since 1979. 

Donors continue to be of the 
utmost importance, as Sera-Tec 
donors produce a significant per- 
centage of the world's Rh Immune 
Globin, a drug used to prevent Rh 
disease in newborns 

The use of this drug alone has 



saved the lives of over a quarter of a 
mdlion babies. 

Other services 
provided include 
using plasma to 
produce typing 
serum to correctly 
match blood for 
transfusions. 




immune globin used to help prevent 
cytomeglovirus in transplant 
patients. Albumin, a plasma compo- 
nent, is vital to the treatment of bum 
and shock victims. 

It's also used for diagnostic con- 
trols for laboratory tests and hepati- 
tis B Immune Globin which is used 
to treat people exposed to hepaiiiis. 

In addition to helping others. 
individuals who donate can also 
receive useful services for them- 
selves when they donate; as the pre- 
donation process includes a com- 
plete physical, as well as an HIV 
lest. 

If any test results are found to be 



abnormal, potential donors will be 
referred to their personal physician. 

College students are favored 
donors, in the opinion of Sera- Tec 
manager, Mark Garringer. 

"College students are more apt 
to avoid high-risk behavior because 
they tend to stay up on things, " said 
Garringer 

Garringer has been manag- 
___ er at Sera-Tec in Fort 
Wayne since its 
beginning in 1979. 

The reason for his 
lengthy tenure, he 
explains, is "I love 
the people 

"I like to refer to us as the bar- 
tenders of the medical community. 
People tell us everything about 
themselves, what they're going to 
do with the money, the music they 
listen to, the car tbey drive, the good 
and bad points of their lives." 

There is usually opportunity for 
dialogue between the Sera-Tec staff 
and the donors because donating 
plasma usually lakes slightly over 
an hour. 

Another facet of plasma dona- 
tion that would make it beneficial to 
college students is that during dona- 
tion, donors are in a reclined posi- 
tion; and can read, chat, or simply 
relax. 

Even though plasma donation is 
ideal for college students, plasma 
donors are usually a diverse group. 

They are blue collar and white 
collar workers, men and women all 
with one thing in common: the need 
to help others 



After passing extensive blood 
and drug screening tests individuals 
can donate blood products. 

The technique called plasma- 
pheresis uses a completely comput- 
erized closed safe system. 

Skilled technicians withdraw 
blood, remove plasma, and return 
the other parts of blood (red cells, 
white cells, and platelets) to the 
blood stream. 

All of this is done using a ster- 
ile, disposable collection system, 
eliminating any risk of transferring 
disease. No two donors use the same 
needle or tubing 

Sera- Tec centers arc located in 
nearly every slate. The other Indiana 
location is in Bloomington The 
company strives to place its centers 
in college towns in an effort to reach 
the collegiate sector of the commu- 
nity. 

Students are more likely to need 
quick cash Payment is given as the 
donor leaves after each donation 

Compensation is based on the 
individual's time-commitment, reli- 
ability, and the demand for each 

individual's plasma type. 

Minimum requirements for 
donating are: must be at least 18 
years old, weigh at least 110 lbs., 
and be in good health 



Serving the peopii 

Campus cop saves life 

Lieutenant Tom Haner does more than write traffic citations at IPFW. 
On SepL 20. Haner saved the life of a human being on campus. 

Jimmy Scott, an electrician, was working to put up a light pole on the 
north side of the new science building when a forklift hit the pole and 
caused it to break ai the base. The tight fell and struck Scott on the head 
which caused serious injury. 

Hancr's quick reaction helped save Scott's life. Haner had the pres- 
ence of mind to put on his latex gloves and apply pressure to the blood 
spurting wound until the EMS arrived 

Scott is currently undergoing physical therapy He is partially para- 
lyzed on his right side and is scheduled to have a plate inserted into bis 
head to replace the crushed skull.

Tensions high 
in Middle East 



Ironically, Tuesday was 
Veteran's Day and die threat of

rently whining that loo large a pro- 
portion of Americans have the upper 
hand compared with other countries 
monitoring the No Fly Zone over 
. Iraq. According to CNN, for almost 
, 10 days Iraq has barred Americans 
from observing monitors within 
chemical plants which were used 
before to make biological weapons 
for Gulf Storm. 



CNN also stated 
a week ago that 
Saddam Hussein 
has been tam- 
pering with 
these monitors 
so that United 
Nations officers 
cannot sec into 
the area. 

Defense 
Secretary 
William Cohen 
has already 
played with the 
idea of possible 
involvement in 
the Middle East 
region. 

"War ves- 
sels could be

Cohen. CNN

on this, the public has little to go on. 
What is at stake besides oil? Are we 
really concerned about democracy 
in Iraq or is Clinton reaching for any 
crumb of opportunity to prove to 
Americans thai be has the ability to 
lead? 

This time around, if there will 
be war with Hussein, we deserve a 
tangible reason for any involve-

Parking garage hinders students' trek 



To the Editor: 



The first pan of this letter is in concurrence 
with Susan Spindler's contention that ample fore- 
thought is noi apparent in the location of the new 
parking garage. The second part may be less 

complimentary 

I offer ihis scenario: 
I SCENE: Architects office, dimly lit. Dust-cov- 
ered IPFW Twenty-five Year Master Plan lays on 
end table in a little-used comer of office. Soda- 
rendenng person approaches table and sets wet 
soda can on Master Plan. Person starts flailing 
about at unseen annoyance.) 

P«rson: "Damn flics!'' 

(Same person grabs fly swatter and approaches 
table. Picks up soda can, and spies a fly nearby- 
Swings swatter seemingly without sense.) 



SPLAT! 

(Person leaves office More dust collects on 
Master Plan. Later, when impatient IPFW offi- 
cials demand answers to questions regarding 
construction delays, architect grabs the all-but- 
forgotten Plan and blows off dust. The residual 
outline of the fly swatter and soda can remain.) 

Architect: "I've got the drawing locating the 
parking garage right here in front of me. . . and, 
hey. . . how about a traffic circle?" 



Now that th'.- origin of the locations has been 
revealed, how will we deal with this problem' 1 
May I suggest inform IPFW faculty, students 
and staff of a new campus-wide program. Plans 
for PWSS (post-walking stress syndrome) 
Centers are on the drawing board to help people 
cope with the aftereffects of walking. Any person 



overcome by the increased circulation and heart- 
beat due to walking will be treated on a first- 
come, first-serve basis. In light of the dramatic 
scope of this problem, each building will have a 
PWSS Center. The program wdl be sponsored by 
IPSGA (Indiana-Purdue Stupid Garage 
Assoc iation.) 

Now, as some of you lake the exception to 
my satire, let me say this: walking alone to your 
vehicle or class at nigbt is not safe. 1 would 
encourage night walkers to call the Campus 
Police, who arc available for escorts at all times. 
For those of you who are inconvenienced by the 
wait of a few minutes until the officer arrives, the 
PWSS Centers will also be equipped to handle 
post-wailing stress syndrome The acronym 
won't even have to be changed (until, of course, 
the disorders are entered into the latest edition of 
tbe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual &gt;

/el. al. melee, I was spurred to 
action by the editorial of a Larry 
Lee in this Sunday's Journal 
Gazette. Mr Lee ends his accolade 
of Chancellor Wartell with [the 
esteem of] " those outside the 
campus should not be tainted by a 
handful of malcontents on the facul- 
ty or an irresponsible student edi- 

Your well-reported articles in 
the past two issues of tbe 

Communicator on the campus cli- 



mate are some of the best journal- 
ism 1 have seen in the student paper 
in my 15 years at IPFW. You are 
obviously having an effect m ihe 
community! (Isn't thai what the 
Wartell administration claims also 
lo be striving for, after all?) 



Tom Kruse 



IPFW Staff Member 



Former campus administrator 
agrees with recent articie 



To The Editor: 

I was on campus this week and 
read with interest your front page 
story about the campus atmosphere 
being poisoned. 



As a former : 
IPFW, 1 agree with the article's 
statements mat the campus climate 
is different since the new chancellor 
arrived three years ago. 

1 resigned my position at the 
university, after seven years of ser- 
vice, two years ago because of the 
very negative climate that had been 
created there. 

I too soon hated coming here to 
work because of negative actions 
(bat happened to me and my 
coworkers, and my work suffered 

So 1 resigned and am glad 1 did, 
but after reading the Communicator 
story. I fell I needed to reaffirm the 



fact in the article thai ihe campus 
now often operates in a negative, 
fearful climate. 

As a peace studies student at 
IPFW. I learned that positive change 
occurs when people speak (be truth 
and Find solutions to injustice and 
problems. 

I encourage members of the 
campus community to find the 
courage to speak out about problems 
at the university so that solutions 
may be found. 

If the truth is heard and dealt 
with honestly, then I have hope for 
the university and its staff, students 
and faculty

Warteil, staff 
supportive, 
says prof 

To The Editor: 



I have no first-hand knowledge 
of the particulars of the offenses 
which Chancellor Michael Wartell 
is alleged to have committed, and 
so am unable to speak one way or 
the other to those charges 

However. I can comment on 
the extent to which I have suffered 
from (he proverbially tumorous 
growths on, or poisoning of. the 
campus environment that we are 
said to have experienced under the 
chancellor's leadership. 

My dealings with the chancel- 
lor's office have been uniformly 
positive. 

I have found Chancellor 
Wartell and bis staff consistently 
helpful and supportive in my acad- 
emic endeavors. The chancellor's 
commitment to IPFW is. in my 
opinion, genuine. 

If 1 have been immersed in 
toxin, it seems to have been poison 
of an unusually salubrious son.

What's weak this u/e 

Dennis DonaEue 



With a little age comes wisdom 



Learning as I go: Lisa linn 




As we 
head down the 
back stretch of 
this semester, I 
am reminded by 
a fellow student 
thai all is not 
right with the 
world. Poverty, 
famine, war, the 
Colls, basically, 
things could be a little better. My 
homework load is more than what I 
expected In fact, I hate school right 
now, well, not hate, but I've got 
ibem "November Blues" Can you 
relate? 

It's very ironic wben you work 
and go to school. If you take time 
off from work to study for thai extra 
class, you don't make as much 
money. If you work more, you have 
to limit your school load. So next 
semester, do I work more and take 
less classes? I wanna get the hell out 
of school as fast as I can I'm in my 
early thirties, my employable clock 
is ticking. 

Did our school professors work 
and go to school too? Do they real- 
ize their class might not be the most 
important thing in our lives. Can 
they tell by looking at all the faces 
of the students who sit through their 
boring, long-winded, tangent filled 
lectures? I can tell who is bored. It 
isn't me subject matter, but mostly 
the way it is presented. I nave had 
some greai teachers here, in fact 
most of them have been great. 

Not to rip on profs, but do you 
know how much our books even 
cost these days? Please don't make 
us spend S60. and then only make us 
read half of it. Not like I want to 
read a lot, but at least use the book 
you assign. Also, what are supple- 
mental readings? Is this extra read- 
ing for those days when I have some 
free time on my hands, which is 
never? Either require it, or don't 
require it 

For example, Professor Dili's, 
for Econ. He writes his own book 
and it costs S8-S10. Everything you 
need is in it. No glossy cover, fancy 
pictures or high publishing costs 
Simple, effective, and cheap. His 
Colleagues should lake note. 

"Library reserve" readings are 
also kind of weird. Making copies 
of articles takes a lot of time and 
money. Eight cents a page this 
semester! I think you (professors) 
expect us to leam our bbrary sys- 
tem, which by the way, is terrible 
Some reserve stuff gels lost and/or 
stolen. And what if it isn't here? 
Professors who do ibis have always 
done this, and they always will. 
However, if you are new here, as a 
teacher, please don't start this awful 
practice

someone in maintenance please set 
me clocks to one specific lime? Is 
this too demanding of a request? 1 
have a professor who doesn't know 
wben to end class because all of the 
clocks are so different. Thai is 
another thing. For example we pay 
you lo lecture for 50 minutes on 
Monday, After that, let us leave, 
don't keep us over with "just one 
more thing." We might nave other 
classes to attend immediately after 
yours, and being late is kind of rude. 

Internet use is now a popular 
tool for profs 1 was introduced to 
this two semesters ago and feel it is 
essential for students (Thanks to 
Carol S.j. We all need to leam this 
computer thing because ibey are 
used everywhere. Professors should 
find "web sites" for students to visit 
as a substitute to "library reserve" 
readings Hint, hint 

Also put your ego's away, we 
don'i care if you are a "Dr." in 
something, just teach You were 
hired to educate us, remember? 
Don't try and weed us out We are 
here to leam. I would love lo "name 
names," but we all talk about who 
sucks, who is good, testing proce- 
dures and the like. Do you as pro- 
fessors care what we think? You 
should It is the reason you even 
have a job Don't belittle us in front 
of our classmates either It is way 
out of line and very unprofessional. 

Also, "thanks'' to all those profs 
who give us their home phone num- 
bers. It really separates those who 
leach from those who want us to 
leam

What an 

amazing feeling 

it is loknow that 

you are really 

growing up. Nol 

a feeling of 

growing old, but 

a feeling of 

growing as a 

person. There 

comes a time in 

everyone's life 

that they see the many changes in 

themselves and as scary as lhai may 

seem, ii is also very wonderful 

Quite awhile ago, one of my 
very best friends and I found our- 
selves searching for something. We 
were not quite sure for what but we 
knew thai we had not found it. 
Imagine bow tough it is lo capture 
something you know you want and 
you'll be able lo imagine how diffi- 
cult it is wben you have no idea 
what it is that you are looking for. 
Each of us bad had long, drawn 



out relationships with a couple of what I bad to do. 
guys and wben they did not work A seemingly impossible mission 

out, we looked to each other for was surprisingly easy. Il was easy 

support. Throughout the following because all 1 had lo do was not think 



r 



summer, each of 
us focused on who 
we were as people 
raiher than who 
we were lo every- 
one else. We found 
who we were, not 
who we thought 
everyone else 
expected us to be. 
Looking back 
on past experi- 
ences throughout 
my life, it is inter- 
esting to realize 
exactly bow vul- ■ ■ ■ 

nerable I was lo 
other people's expectations of me 
and how I should live my life. Some 
of these expectations were healthy. 
however, some were nol. 



IS INTERESTING TO 
REALIZE EXACTLY 
HOW VULNERABLE I 
WAS TO OTHER PEO- 
PLE'S EXPECTATIONS 

OF ME AND HOW I 
SHOULD LIVE MY LIFE 



about it Not psy- 
choanalyze it but 
let it work itself 
out. I jusi kicked 
back, enjoyed 
every opportunity I 
had and did nol 
worry myself sick 
about what every 
little thing meant. 

I'm a firm believ- 
er lhai everything 
happens for a rea- 
son and I try to 
make sense out of 
i =: everything 

Otherwise, I feel 
that no one ever learns their lessons 
and too often find themselves in the 
same situation over and over again 



However, some things, I believe. 
Deciding which was which was should be thought about learned 



from and let go of. 

Life does nol offer any guaran- 
tees, except that life, itself, is guar- 
anteed to have none. I prefer to have 
guarantees, but realize they are near- 
ly impossible. I guess thai's why 
I've learned that if you don't take 
some risks you won't ever have any- 
thing better. 

Last week 1 was discussing life 
with another good friend of mine 
My friend is younger than I am and 
as we talked, I really began to see 
Ihe big picture of life. I remember 
when I was a freshman at IPFW. I 
thought that I knew all there was to 
know about people. Looking back, I 
realize that I was clueless. Not that I 
think that I have all of the answers 
now. but I guess ibat's my point. 

I've come to a certain realiza- 
tion that the more 1 leam about the 
world, the less I know about the 
world I can finally say. "Hey, I'm 
really growing up!" And I think 
that's pretty cool. 



Chinese relations should be strained 



Big Rob's Ramblings: Rooert Enders 




Hearing 
about Bill 
Clinton preach 
to Chinese 
president Jiang 
Zemin about 
human rights is 
like watching 
Tina, the hypo- 
thetical sexually 
active teenager 
be lectured by her hypothetical 
mother about the importance of 
abstinence. 

Tina's mom goes over all the 
virtues of keeping ones pants zipped 
up. 

Mom tries to be polite, gently 
referring to her daughter's behavior 
while calmly resisting the urge to 
call ber daughter a slut. Tina 
responds with as many "I'm sonys. 
I was wrongs and It won't happen 
agains" as il takes to butter up Mom 



into giving back Tina's car keys 
before 8 p.m. Friday, 

Mom returns Tina her keys, 
hoping that Tina has learned a les- 
son. Tina hopes that she doesn't get 
caught next time. 

Family unity is preserved with 
placating by both sides. 

Is world unity worth placating 
the Chinese wilh their history of 
human rights abuses. Clinton wants 
to please Jiang He tries to be polite. 
saying thai China is on the wrong 
side of history while resisting the 
urge to call Jiang a pinko-tinhom- 
dictator Jiang admits that the 
Tiannamin Square massacre was a 



mistake (I'm sorry and it won't hap- 
pen again) and promises not to sell 
nuke technology to Iran so thai 
China can buy that same technology 
from the U.S. Clinton hopes that 
Jiang has more respect for human 
rights 

Jiang hopes thai be can continue 
to imprison and execute political 
dissidents without endangering 
China's most favored nation trading 
status. Good diplomatic relations 
are preserved with placating by both 
sides. 

If the Chinese president is any- 
thing like his predecessors, Mao 
Tse-iung and Deng Xiapeng, then 



Beijing will most ukcly go back to 
us bad habits Just because this man 
has donned a cowboy hat and a tri- 
com in public does not mean be has 
adopted American principles any 
more than wearing a dress means 
that Dennis Rodman is a woman. 

What's really scary is lhai a 
number of experts have predicted 
that the only reason China has not 
invaded Taiwan or the Spratley 
Islands yet is that Beijing fears lhai 
the West will block Portugal's 
returning Macao to China in 1999. 

They are guessing thai soon 
after Macao's legitimate return, 
China will start a war.

Dash-In offering ethnic cuisine, local talent and veggie fare 



By Shelley Porter 
Culinary Reporter 



The Dash-In coffee bouse, 
located on Calhoun Street in down- 
town Fori Wayne, is a fun and invit- 
ing place to grab an early morning 
muffin and a cup of coffee, some 
lunch or dinner, a cappuccino or 
espresso "pick-me-up," or a micro- 
brewed beer accompanied by some 
live tunes Sound eclectic? It is! 
Touted on the menu as "Fori 
Wayne's Premiere Coffee House 
and More..." the Dash-In truly has a 
lol lo olTcr to its customers morn- 
ing, noon and night. 

Daily, the Dash-In bakes fresh 
muffins and biscolb, not to mention 
a luscious assortment of cookies, 
brownies and cheesecakes. These 
baked treats are available all day 
and evening and are perfect accom- 
paniments for the "Java" offerings 
on the menu. 

The Dash-In pours a nice selec- 
tion of coffee dnnks. from the stan- 
dard espressos, lanes and cappucci- 
nos to the more exotic Vietnamese 



Coffee, an iced espresso with 
sweetened condensed milk. Coffee 
lovers with a penchant for ice cream 
will enjoy the shakes and malts the 
Dash-In whips up. 

The Colombian house coffee, 
as well as the flavored coffees, are 
Fori Wayne's own Cadillac -brand 
coffees The coffee beans for the 
"world" coffees, such as 
Guatemalan and Sumatran, served 
ai the Dash-In are roasted ai the 
Ancora Coffee Company, out of 
Boston 

Alcoholic h bau on -seekers can 
order a nicely-rounded selection of 
domestic, draft and imported beers 
The wine selection is more limited. 
but includes the basic reds and 
whites. 

Dasb-In's menu is fun and cov- 
ers a range of ethnic cuisines, from 
Southwestern to Middle Eastern Ai 
first glance, the menu evokes 
"healthy" eating, with whole wheat 
breads, bagels, and tortillas, bean 
sprouts, spinach and vegetarian 
offerings. 

A closer look, however, reveals 
that fat-laden cheeses, dressings 



and sour cream 
abound The 
Dash-In 




ers can "bold" the cheese or mayo. 

Vegetarians will find a lot of 
choices on the menu. The Falafel 
Pita is a Middle-Eastern dish of a 
vegetarian burger served in a pita, 
with cucumbers, tomatoes and feta 
cheese accompanied by a yogurt 
sauce. 

Hummus is another Middle 
Eastern specialty It's a dip made of 
garbanzo beans (chick peas) and 
tabini (sesame seed paste), and tra- 
ditionally served with pita bread. 
It's an acquired taste for some peo- 



ple, but once acquired. slighUy 
addictive. 

The Dash-In also offers a wide 
variety of grilled and den sandwich- 
es, many of them vegetarian 
uthweslem-style grilled 
chicken breasts, peppers 
and onions, as well as 
quesadillas, 
fajitas and 
black beans 
appear in many 
combinations on the 
menu. 

Turkey, roast beef,

Staff Whiteh 

When people tiy io think of some 
one who is "strong," the image 
thai usually comes Io mind is the 
person who has the bigge; 
muscles, holds ihe largest 
weapon or puts on the best 
fight. Yei the strength of a 
person's mind is often over- 
looked. 

Lately, it seems 
Hollywood is having similar 
thoughts as their high-profile 
films hit the big screens. In a 
number of films, audiences 
will witness the power of many 
actors' physical abilities, and in 
many instances, forget to find a 
story to go along with them. 

Lately, the power of the mind has 
been set aside to give what directors 
feel audiences want — some great 
high-impact action sequences. 

One such film is last weekend's 
premiere of the highly anticipated, 
sci-fi film "S tars n i p 
Troopers " Director Paul 
Verhoeven's S100 million-plus epic 
is a visual treat 

Nevertheless, one may feel the 
film is missing something — possi- 
bly a purpose For me, it seemed to 
have the words "Be All Thai You 
Can Be" written all over it. 
'Troopers" seemed like one big 
advertisement to join the army now. 
On the other hand, the director 




Qlus, even though 
Halloween just 
ended, fans may 
be interested to 
know that Jamie 
Lee Curtis is considering 
returning to the 
"Halloween" film fran- 
chise by acting in the 
next sequel. I guess if 
these genre films are 
good enough for Drew 
Barrymore and Winona 
Ryder she might as well 
live it up again. Better 
yet, Wes Craven 
("Scream," "A Nightmare 
on Elm Street") may be 
directing it. 

Bequels seem to 
keep rolling on 
and on. Plans are 
in the process for 
bringing a fourth 
"Die Hard," a 
fourth "Lethal Weapon," 
a fifth "Alien," and a sec- 
ond "Silence of the 
Lambs." Plus, one can 
only wonder how "Home 
Alone 3" will do this sea- 
son without the appear- 
ance of McCauley Culkin. 
For those of you who 
feel that film-making 
could not be farther 
away from home: The 
producers of "In the 
Company of Men" are 
currently shooting 
scenes for the movie 
"American Reel" in the 
Fort Wayne area. The 
film stars David 
Carradine as a struggling 
singer trying to make it 
big.

seemed 

smart enough 
to bring in 
young, attractive 
cast 

Strangely enough, most of them 
bad played in "Melrose Place," 
"Beverly Hills. 90210" or "Parly of 
Five" at some lime or another So, if 
by chance there was a non-existent 
plot, at leasi the audience could 
drool over the soldiers. In fact, the 
shower scene full of nude men and 
women should suffice this point. 

The film is not all unfavorable. 
Like I said before, the special 
effects are tremendous and most of 
the acting is tolerable But the mor- 
bid vision of the future is one that 
can be unsettling 

While everyday people are 
praying for world peace, our worst 
enemies could be those damn icr- 
mites crawling through our walls. 
So, be warned, this is no "Star 
Wars." "Star Trek" or 
"Independence Day." yet who can 
blame the guy for trying with such a 
unique approach? 

A film with no wits but plenty 
of suspense is "I Know What 
You Did Last Summer With 
the same producers as "Scream." I 
was rooung for this film to be great 
I was longing for Jennifer Love- 
Hewitt to claim the same success 
her "Party of Five" co-star Neve 
Campbell had received. Yet, once 
again, 1 was disappointed. 

The film dealt with four teen- 
agers who are involved in a hit-and- 
run, then decide to keep it a secret. 
Predictably, the past comes back to 
haunt them and lo kill them. It is a 
scary flick — but do not have any 
higher anticipation. 

First of all. the portrayal of 
these naive teen-agers was very 
oblique. Tbey were characters who 
were so dim-witted they were des- 
tined to be killed off. In fact, if 
Anne Heche was not there to save 
the cast, the film may have been just 
unbearable. The characters fought 
for their lives, yet their brains 
seemed incapable of doing anything 
logical 

The film seemed to want to be so 
scary, yet forgot the aspect of giving 
some character to their stars "1 
Know What You Did Last Summer" 
tried to take the killer's hook from 
"Candyman." the weak women 



from 

every "Friday the 13th" movie and 
some laughs from "Scream " 
Nevertheless, this mi* does not 
leave much room for originality. 

Lately, the best theater bet 
seems lo be "Kiss the Girls," a 
film that seems to at least try to rely 
on the action and the brains of lis 
characters. For those who tiked 
"Seven" or 'The Silence of the 
Lambs," this film may give you 
some enjoyment Once again, do 
not make it out to be anything more. 
The story revolves around an 
attacker who claims female victims 
for his personal pleasure. The twist 
however is that he kidnaps those 
who have brains and talent, not the 
weak and vulnerable. He doesn'l 
kill them, except for a few, but 
keeps them hostage for his own rea- 
sons. 

The cast is much better than the 
aforementioned two films. Morgan 
Freeman and Ashley Judd give 
strong performances as the detec- 
tive and one of the victims. In their 
hunt for the man behind the may- 
hem, psychological scares lead lo 
the breaking climax. 

It is not a film with scare after 
scare, but definitely something to be 
disturbed over. 

On the other hand, there still 
seems lo something withheld. Is it 
possible they put too much empha- 
sis on Judd's fighting abilities rather 
than her intellectual instincts? Was 
the mystery just too easy to figure 
out? I'm not real sure. If someone 
discovers the missing ingredient. 
please let me know. 

But if you haven't seen it yet, it 
is probably better to wait until it 
comes to Gateway, Glenbrook or 
Georgetown. 

So, how long will this streak of 
aggressive, strong action-driven 
films last? It doesn't seem likely 
that it will be ending anytime soon. 
1 just hope that "Scream 2." 
"Alien Resurrection" and 
"Titanic" live up to their expecta- 
tions by giving the audience what 
they really want. Characters who 
have the smarts and the aggressive- 
ness to know when it is time to fight 
back, draw conclusions or run like 
hell. 

It's going to be a suspenseful 
holiday season.

Bv Ben Ruble 
Staff Whiter 

I am sure that by now you have 
at least heard about the Pentium II 
processors from Intel. There are a 
number of funky, flashy commer- 
cials with the Pentium II van on 
television. However, die majority 
of us know very little about these 
new processors, so I did a little 
ivestigating in order to do this arti- 
cle. 

Earlier this year, the Pentium 
processors with MMX technology 
were being packaged in many of 
die Windows 95 computers The 
MMX was supposed to improve 
audio, video, and graphical data 
manipulation by adding 57 new 
instructions lo the processors. The 
new Pentium II processors also use 
the MMX technology lo improve 
the quality of its performance. 

Going into more technical 
terms, the Pentium II has two 
improved features over the 
Pentiums and the Pentiums with 
MMX technology. It has improved 
on the Dual Independent Bus 
(D.I. B.) architecture. This uses two 
buses instead of one, which allows 
die processor lo have one bus per- 
fomi the current transaction, while 
die other does a separate transac- 
tion, or it can have both buses work 
on the same transaction at the same 
time In simpler terms, if it can do 
more than one complex thing at a 
time or if it can have two buses 
doing the same thing at the same 
lime, it speeds up performance 
time. 

Another feature that the 
Pentium II possesses is something 
Intel calls "Dynamic Execution " 
This rearranges the way that the 
processor processes data into a 
more efficient way. This allows the 
processor lo manipulate data rather 
just process a set list of 
instructions. It basically organizes 
information into more efficient 
means 

The Pentium II processor is 
much bigger in size than its prede- 



C jCorrier^ ^^ 



cessor. the Pentium. This limits the 
Pentium II from being built into 
laptop computers The inside of 
laptops are already crammed full, 
so until Intel designs a smaller ver- 
sion of the Pentium II, laptops, 
unfortunately, will not cany the 
Pentium II processor. 

But, for the average home and 
business desktop and mini-tower 
computers, this is a major develop- 
ment. Ray Chander, a computer 
department salesman at Besi Buy, 
thinks this chip will take us into the 
next generation of compuicr tech- 
nology. According to Chander, the 
Pentium II processors can keep get- 
ting faster without overheating as 
easily as their predecessors. He 
says that the larger size of the 
Pentium II makes it harder for it to 
overheat. 



Chander adds, "If I were choos- 
ing between a Pentium and Pentium 
II, I would spend the extra on the 
Pentium II .It's upgradable ( to the 
Pentium II "s eventual replace- 
ment)." 

The Pentium II processors cur- 
rently are available with speeds of 
233-, 266-, and 3 00 -megahertz. 
Most of the new computers with 
Windows '95 carry the new 
Pentium }] processor With the 
great possibilities that they have, 
the Intel Pentium II processors are 
going to lake our PCs inlo a new 
era.

Pentium II processors, visit Intel's 
web site al www.intel.com.

three newcom-

supposed [o

tive contribution to this team have 
been lost to injuries; Megan Turner, 
Nakia Young and Michael Minor 
have been medically redshined and 
will not be able to play nest year but 
all is not lost. 

With sis returnees, what the 
team has lost in depth they will 
make up inexperience. 

Head Coach Pam Dowden said 
that "these injuries arc not going to 
be used as an excuse if the team 
starts to pcrfnrm bad because you 
play with die hand that is dealt to 
you." 

&lt; llhei things thai have made this 
;ui unusual season is that three play- 
er', who are on the roster are 
involved in other sports.

her shooting range and moves in the 
post 

A freshman who has made a 
positive impression on Bowden is 
Corey Duncan. 

"She will receive a lot of play- 
ing time and since she can use both 
hands, she will be 
tough to guard and 
her rebounding is 
outstanding and her 
confidence is grow- 
ing " Bowden said. 

Assistant coach 
Allegra Stocizel 
will help Bowden 
try to improve this 
team from last 
years 11-16 record. 

"She makes a 
good connection 
with the players 




these girls 
n n t i 
December," 
Bowden said. 

The oiher 
Dcion Sanders clone 
will be Melissa Hasslcr 
from the womens tennis team. 
Bowden is looking for her to play 
the point guard position and "pro- 
vide a few minules to give our 
starlet a rest." 

All sU of the returnees are 
going to be expected to provide 
leadership. Leah Sheets, a four-year 
player, is going to lead the team as a 
tri-captain and as one of the top 
returnees. 

Bowden says Leah is one of the 
quickest players she has ever 
coached and has worked hard on 
increasing her range. 

Other players that Bowden is 
counting on are Krista Hennings, 



because she 
helps to form a 
bridge with the 
players She was 
a very basketball 
smart player in col- 
lege and she helps 
the players learn from 
their mistakes." said 
Bowden 



With the start of the season just 
ahead Bowden feels that the first 
four games will be important lo her 
players to sec where they are at 
because of the team's inability to 
play very much five on five basket- 
ball due to the lack of players and 
injuries. 

"The post game will be a strong 
asset to the team but we will still try 
to run and play a motion offense 
with a half-court trap for defense," 
Bowden said 

The Summit City Shootout will 
also be a good gauge of where the 
ladies are at, said Bowden, "because 
if the team practices like it did today 
it should win the tournament." 

The format of the conference 
championship is the same as the

ketball tour-

poll and the mens poll. 

The team needs to place seventh 
or better to be eligible to play in the 
tournament but Bowden feels that 
they are an unknown quantity in the 
league and nobody knows bow they 
will play. 



while Florida State is reigning 
supreme with the USA TodayCNN 
poll, even though the number one 
team, Nebraska, won on a fluke. 

The possibilities are immense 
because all three teams should beat 
their opponents and the rankings 
should remain constant. 

With Michigan locked into the 
Rose Bowl the chances of a clear cut 
champion are fading. Isn't this what 
the Bowl Alliance was supposed to 
solve? 

•The Bears and Colls showed 
that they are inept as ever by losing 
again. You have to give them credit 
for being consistent. 

Not only arc they losing but the 
ways dial they are finding to lose are 
getting more creative. 

The rumors are already flying 
on which coach will get to have the 
number one pick because neither of 
these coaches should still be around 
in April for the NFL draft 

•The protected list will be 
released this week for major league 
baseball. Each team will be able to 
protect 15 players and the rest of 
them will be able to be drafted by 
the expansion, Arizona 
Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay 
Devilrays 

Expect to see some well-known 
names leave unprotected teams 
because of high salaries and low 
performance. Some teams are using 
as many as 7 of these spots on pitch- 
ers because they feel that they can 
get more value by trading them

*Top five reasons lhat 
Michael Jordan should 
retire at the end of the year: 



S. Probably wouldn't be a good 
thing to start looking for "Depends" 
endorsement. 

4 Needs to start spending some of 
his money so that economy will 
recover. 

3. Needs lo stop listening to Allen 
Ivcrson's advice on how lo raise 
chddren without paying support 

2 Needs to stop carrying the team 
so that people will slop talking 
about how good Pippen and 
Company are. (Little secret, they 
aren't that good without Mike!)

Kathy Lee discussing how to gel

Charles Barkley should stay 
in basketball: 



5 We need more cheap fouls at ihe

4. "Round mound of rebound" 
sounds belter than "Fat guy on the

3 Who can take his place beating 
up drunks or spitting on fans? 

2. Because he may get the idea lhat 
he should act. I can only handle one 
"Fish that saved Pittsburgh" bomb. 



1 Some fools may actually elect 
him as governor. 



•Purdue returned to its winning 
ways by holding off the Michigan 
State Spartans in a game that earlier 
Purdue teams would have found a 
way to lose. 

I think n may be time to consid- 
er ihem a legitimate team this year. 



•Good news IU fans: Your foot- 
ball team didn't lose this week, but 
your basketball team provided 
another lackluster performance. 

The question used to be, 
"Should a change be made at head 
coach?" and now it's "a change 
should be made!!" 

When will people realize that 
Bobby Knight is a dinosaur who is 
past his prime??
