New degree 

program 

approved 



On March 10, IPFW was 
approved to add a new Bachelor 
of Science degree to its dlrcjily 
outstanding roster of over 180 
degree programs. 

The Indiana Commission for 
Higher Education approved IPFW's 
request to upgrade a current two- 
year degree to a full four-year BS 
degree. 

Now, IPFW proudly offers a 
four-year BS in interior design. 

Matthew Kubrik, the director of 
the interior design program here, 
says that the upgrade has been in 



Education Research, which is also 
suspending accreditation for two- 
year programs. 



Easter basket 
donations 
now accepted 

Starting March I , the Northeast 
Indiana Alumni Directors 
Consortium is asking thai IPFW 
students, faculty, friends and 
families chip in this Easier season 
to help the children of SCAN 
(Stop Child Abuse and Neglect) by 
donating fully stocked, wrapped 
Easter baskets. 

The Consortium's goal is to 
collect 800 baskets by April 7. 

Baskets should be wrapped 
in colorful cellophane and filled 
with gifts and/or candy, which is 
still in the package or individually 

Once the basket is prepared, 
the generous individual should 
drop their basket off at IPFW 
information desks in Walb or 
Kettler. IPFW does not stand 

Rather, Ivy Tech, Indiana 
InstituteofTechnology, Huntington 
College, Grace, l.ivlur, M.uilIh-su'i, 
Saint Francis, Tri State and Indiana 
Wesleyan are also taking part in 
the basket collection. 



■imost a year ago a 28-22

and honored the Central Time, 
while 5 honored the Eastern 
Time. There were 19 counties 
that requested to be moved to 
Central Time, however only 8 
counties will be added, for a total 
of 18 counties on Central Time, 
leaving 74 counties switching to 
Eastern Time. 

The time switch is usually 
thought of as "spring forward" 
The thought 



is said to allow more business 
to be done, where in the fall 
by subtracting an hour it adds 
daylight to morning hours.

for those of you who may be out

when the bar intends to close. 
The laws state that all alcohol 
has to be consumed by 3am in a 
bar. After calling various bars in 
town the majority of them said 
that they had not made exact 
decisions on how they will be 
handling the time switch. With 
the switch taking place at 2am, 
legally they would have to be 
closing at 2am since it would 
then be 3am. So this may add a 
damper to some people's night. 
Starting in 2007 the switch 
will take place almost a month 
earlier due to the fact that 
Congress approved a change to

Sleeping drug proves 
anything but restful 



By Andrew Buttaro 



If you are among those who received 
one of the approximately 26 million 

prescriptions for Ambien distributed last 



your sleep! Recent medical studies report 
some of the drug's users have been prone 
to sleepwalk to their kitchens, raiding their 
refrigerators for food and cooking meals on 

Researchers are finding evidence to link 
Ambien to this curious side effect of eating 
while sleep walking, according to The New 
York Times. Dr. Mark Mahowald, director 
of the Minnesota Regional Sleep Disorders 
Center in Minneapolis and colleagues as 
well as researchers from the Mayo Clinic 
in Rochester, Minn, are discovering that 
eating disorders are common in people 
using Ambien for sleep-related problems. 

The most common side effects listed on 
the drug's Web site do not include sleep- 
related eating disorders. Side effects cited 
are drowsiness, dizziness, lightheadedness, 
and difficulty with coordination. The site 
suggests to never drink alcohol when "being 
treated with Ambien or any sleep medicine.

machinery, or piloting an aircraft" when 
initially using this drug. 



i side effect; 
come problematic when taken "while 
iveling, such as during an airplane flight 



and the person wakes up before the effect of 
the medicine is gone." Tolerance can occur 
when sleep medicine is "used every night 
for more than a few weeks." The Ambien 
Web site advises to use sleep medicines for 
short amounts of time, "such as 1 or 2 days 
and generally no longer than I or 2 weeks." 

Dependence has also resulted "when 
these [sleep medicinesl are used regularly 
for longer than a few weeks or at high doses. 
Some people develop a need to continue 
taking their medicines ... If the medicine 
is suddenly stopped the body is not able to 
function normally." Withdrawal symptoms 
can result after sleep medicine is abruptly 
stopped after being used on a regular basis 
for a long period. Mild cases have resulted 
in "unpleasant feelings," while severe 
cases have caused "abdominal and muscle 
cramps, vomiting, sweating, shakiness, and 
rarely, seizures may occur." 

Unusual changes in behavior and 
thinking are not common side effects, 
but have been reported to include "more 
outgoing or aggressive behavior than 
normal, confusion, strange behavior, 
agitation, hallucinations, worsening of 
depression, and suicidal thoughts." 

Frequency and severity of these 
problems depends on a patient's general 
health, other medicines taken, and what 
kind of sleep medication is being utilized. 

The manufacturer of Ambien, Sanofi- 
Aventis, defends its product as safe and 
reliable. Melissa Feltmann, one of the 
company's spokespersons, reported to The 
New York Times that while sleep-related 
eating disorders are printed on Ambien's 
package insert as a potential side effect, not 
all cases in patients who use Ambien may 
stem from the use of the sleep medicine. 
Most of the people who use Ambien report 
that it successfully puts them to sleep, 
although doctors and patients both report 
that sleep-eating is one of a variety of 
unusual reactions to (he drug. 



Dr. Carlos Schenck, a sleep disorders 
expert based in Minneapolis is leading 
a study exploring this particular effect 



States who use Ambien have experienced 
sleep : related eating disorders while on this 
sleep medication. He reports that patients 
commonly are cognizant that they have 
an eating problem but do not realize that 
it can be associated with the sleeping pill. 
He found that once most of his patients 
discontinued use of Ambien and switched 
to another sleep medication, such as 
Lunesta and Sonata, their sleep-eating 
problems ended. 

One of Schenck's patients, ludie Evans, 
had beentakingAmbien during her recovery 
period from back surgery. Despite being in 
a full-body cast, she had been getting up 
to eat while asleep. Initially unaware of the 
problem, she did not become conscious of 
what was happening until her son spent 
several nights taking care of her and told 
her of her sleepwalking episodes, which 
included going into the kitchen, cooking 
bacon and eggs, eating a sandwich, and 
turning on the oven. 

Four suits have been filed by former 
Ambien users against Sanofi-Aventis in the 
U.S. District Court in Manhattan last week. 
Two of them reported that they became 
sleep-eaters because of using Ambien. 

There have not been concrete 
conclusions regarding the link between 
Ambien use and sleep-eating, however, as 
some experts are not certain as to whether 
the resulting sleep-eating is an effect of the 
drug or a commonality among the large 
number of people who are using it. While 
the jury is still out on that conclusion, it

Know your rights: 
search and seizure 



The fourth amendment to 
the United States Constitution 
reads as follows: "The right of 
the people to be secure in their 
persons, houses, papers, and 
effects, against unreasonable 



searches and si 
be \ 






i, shall n 



legal standard called "probable 
cause," which is a shorthand 
way of saying thai the officer 
must have probable cause to 
believe that a crime is taking 
place. If the search leads to 
an arrest, this probable cause 
must stand up to judicial 
scrutiny, and so must be more 
substantial than just a hunch. 

Although there are a 
multitude of things which 
might constitute probable

safeguards protecting the 
people from arbitrary searches 
or other forms of unreasonable 
government intrusion. 

However, these safeguards 
often do not work as well as

people do not know their rights 
and therefore cannot assert 

What follows is a brief 
summary of the protections 
you as a citizen enjoy under 
the fourth amendment, and 
examples of how they can be 
applied to ordinary situations.

the fourth 
amendment. 

When an officer desires 
to conduct a search but does 
not have probable cause to 
do so (which is often the case 
when the officer is looking 
for something small and 
easily concealed) he or she 
will simply ask the person for 
their permission. Although 
this sounds simple enough, 
widespread ignorance of 
search and seizure protections 
leaves many people vulnerable 
to tactics of confusion on die 
pan of the polic 



in a casual manner and with 
assertive body language, this 
can convey the impression 
that the officer doesn't really 
care whether or not the hearer 
minds; additionally, either a 
yes or a no can be interpreted 
as permission to conduct a 
search. Not answering such a 
question can also be interpreted 
as consent to a search. 

The American Civil Liberties 
Union (ACLU) recommends 
that people in such situations 
say something assertive and 
unambiguous, along the 
lines of "1 do not consent to a

So, colleges keep raising prices People slop going. The "value" 
of the diploma goes WAV up. Ibis is not something we, as degree- 
holders, will see. (lur children, however, will live in a world where 
you can do lots and lots of jobs with a high school degree again 
and college will only be for certain jobs (doctor, teacher, lawyer, 
scientist) and the "business degree" will go back to being a high 
school job with lots of on-the-job training. Certain degrees 
that are frivolous and certain jobs that need experience, not

Degree-holders in technical degrees or for careers that need a

people go back to school.

have such and such and need this medication. I asked myself if the 
intake of medicaiion is really as necessary a. 



instead of some fabricated medication. 

1 am not a doctor, so do nol lake my advice by any means, but I

drive into certain areas of toun n night mi -finger moves over to 
the door lock button and pushes it to allow me to feel more secure. 
Well, if my mind serves me right, the first automobiles put into 
production did not have locks on the doors. Yet now we cannot 
seem to live without them. 

The fear that someone is going to steal our car, items inside 
the car or even attack us and lake the car exists. Is this merely an 
increase in crime or a fear that has been placed upon us? Not only 
this, but what about the home security systems? Do 1 really sleep 
better at night knowing that my house is secured from an intruder 
breaking in and attacking me at night, or that my possessions are 
safe during the day while 1 am in class?

enough forme to graduate with nn degree? Well, of course this is 
on an individual basis, but I mysell wonder some of these things 
once in awhile. The biggest, of course, is making sure I am going to 
be able to graduate when I plan to. 

Now, before you say "You really need some Prozac," look at your 
own life and the little things you do during the day. If someone 
sneezes beside you do you turn your head? If someone dressed 
in black is walking by you at night, do you find yourself stepping 
aside to let them pass cautiously? Do you find yourself wondering 
if you need a certain medication and if so why? 

I am merely poiming out the simple fact that I feel our society 
has taken a horribly wrong turn to being paranoid and that it 
seems to me it is created not oul\ by our own experiences, but also 
by the media. I mean, is it really that important il someone Steals

Pasquali's Ponderings 



The one item we all desire to have, hate giving aw 
and cannot live without. Money, the item that makes o 
society go 'round. Thanks to our college state of life, m&lt; 

of us are trying to live and strive for the bare n " 



With how important money is to all of us, we would 
not dare go throwing it around, or just handing it out to 
everyone that asks for some. Well, despite how well we 
think we handle our money, there are plenty of others 
throwing money around to make up for it. 

I, along with most of my friends, trust putting our 
bank for safekeeping, 



Despite the stupidity t&gt;f ihis List robbery, my favorite 



H&lt;ies as follows: a man with 
a bank, tells the employee-

it walking into a bank, asking

The first story comes from 
approximately 40 years old, walked into a bank, slipped 
the teller a note demanding cash, then walked out with 
the money. As pathetic as the whole thing is, it gets worse. 
The robber handed them a note that he apparently did 
not use his spellchecker on. 

That is right, the guy did not even spell all of the words 
correctly on his note, and he only used three 10 five words. 
1 wonder what the note could have looked like. "Gimme bag," 



is easier than third grade math. Helmet + Bag = $31,000. 
Yeah, I do not see that quite adding up, but it sure did in 
this person's favor. 

My other favorite story about robberies does not 
occur at a bank, but it's still just as priceless. In Oakland, 
California, a man was arrested in connection with 16 
robberies at several different food chains. Four of those 
16 occurred at the same Taco Bell. 

The beauty of this story is that the employees at the 
Taco Bell would open the cash register whenever they saw 
the man coming. I think this man deserves an award. He 
did not even have to try at robbing places anymore, they 
just opened up their cash registers and handed him the 
money at the same place repeatedly. Kudos to you sir, 



(get a job, they just try and sieal ii from everyone else.

our money to everyone lliai says "Put the money in the

Gaming, drugs and 
academic performance 



I Have A Beard 



"The Pope is in the outhouse. I 
repeat: the Pope is in the outhouse." 

Thus began a quick series of phone 
conversations on Monday designed to 
madden a friend of mine who was stuck 
at work. You see, the Pope was not 
actually in an outhouse (that I know of, 
anyway) but 1 have always wanted to 
deliver importani news via some kind of 



amount of hypocrisy in the fact that we 
tolerate games like "Oblivion" but not 
cocaine, when "Oblivion" and a coke 
habit have effects that are in some ways 

That's for another week, though. At 
the moment, I'm concerned about the 
fact that the outside world often seems

"Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion." A lot of you 
will already be aware of this, but then

likely to be too busy playing the game lo

I myself am leaving it in the box,

people about the Pope being in the 
outhouse because this is Monday, not 
Tuesday - a few stores got the game a 
day early. "Oblivion" is a big enough 
title that there's a bit ola feeding frenzy 
surrounding its release, and news travels 
fast ... especially when a game hits 
shelves a day early. 

Now. all this behavior on the part of 
obsessive gamers like myself brings op 
a few unflattering parallels that I'd like 

The release of "Oblivion" is in oneway 
badly timed. It would really be much 
better if the game had been released 
after the spring semester was over; as is, 
Bethesda Softworks is going to do their 
very best to hose my G.P.A. along with a 
lot of other people's.

though the temptation is to blame this 
on parents/teachers/ethnocentrlcity/ 
etc., the truth seems to be a lot simpler 
than that. 

For a modern student, there are a 
roughly infinite number of things to 
do with any given hour that are more 
interesting than school. Gaming, of 
course, is just one example - there are of 
course the old standbys: sex, drugs, and 
rock'n'roll.., not to mention television. 

Put all that together with a culture 



teachers, or a sexisr curriculum, it's that 
the students just don't care. 

Maybe this is because we're thinking

"The Greatest" begins with

the beautiful vocal talents of

into the average lounge bar. On 
"Living Proof" the tempo picks 
up mildly, quickly returning to 
the piano-based ballad "Lived

An apt perspective on the NCAA 
Tourney and IPFW volleyball 



Witty Banter 

Skip Hooligan &amp; Trip McFeeley 



sportsOipfwco 






Skip: Well, after an amazing Skip and 
Trip weekend in which we successfully 
extorted free drinks and damaged a certain 
apartment, we are back for your reading 
pleasure! 

Trip: That's right. If we opened up the 
Skip and Trip Mansion of Debauchery to 
the public, we would see a hajj not to 
Mecca, but to Fort Wayne. 

Skip: That's right; oh the stories we 
could tell. This is always the most exciting 
time of the year, the NCAA tournament is in 
full swing and we are down to the Sweet 16. 
How is your bracket holding up ol' Trip? 

Trip: Well, looking at it right now I have 
11 of 16 teams still in and six of my eight 
Elite Fight teams. 

Skip: I'm one lower than you, with those 
idiot jayhawks screwing up my bracket. We 
both lost them on our brackets from our 
article last week. Now, not to pat our backs, 
actually yeah to pat our backs, we had the 
Texas A&amp;M upset picked right. 1 almost 
hit the potential upsets of Winthrop over 
Gonzaga and Xavier over Gonzaga too. 

Trip: I also picked those lame Buckeyes 
to get knocked off by Georgetown. If only 



Michigan State as Cinderella 

Big 10 apparently forgot to show up this 

Trip: The Big 10 looked like the UBC in 
the first two rounds. Oh well; I'm hoping 
to win some cash by the end of this 
tournament, the best three weeks in sports 
all year. Don't you think, Skippy? 

Skip: It has to be, easily. Better then 
the three week long Foghat convention in 
Winstom-Salem, NC. How do you think the 
rest of the tournament will shape up? 

Trip: I see Duke coming out of Hotlanta, 
UCLA coming out of Oakland, UConn 
coming out of D.C. and Florida coming out 
of Minneapolis. And I'm picking Michigan 



to win the NIT. How bout you, Skipster? 

Skip: I don't even know who's in the 
NIT right now, so I can't answer that, but 
I'm liking Texas in Hotlanta, UCLA out of 
Oakland, UConn just got an easy ride to the 
Final Four and 1 like Florida as well. 

Trip: Great minds think nearly alike, 
Skippy. Almost as good as the games has 
been the commercials. Ain't that right? 

Skip: Oh my God, I think CBS fired the 
producers behind the scenes because 1 saw 
the same 10 to 15 commercials the whole 
time. Can you tell me what is on sale at 
Applebces this month? 

Trip: Nah, I'd rather see Shaq and Mia 



and they just knocked off those homers 
from Kail suite again. 

Skip: In impressive fashion, too. Looks 
like they are making a case to go to the 
Final Four in volleyball this year. And who 



Trip: It's Arnie Ball. A legend around 
these pans. I would say. 

Skip: Yes indeed, I'd like to see him go

the prerequisite for that commercial was 
that you had to be drunk. In that case, 
perhaps we would have Fit right in last 
weekend.

IPFW was one of only two 
Independent teams, along with 
Savannah State, who placed no 
players on the team. 

Fife noted that the unbalanced 
home versus road schedule kept 
players out of classes too long and has 
not helped the academic side. 

"We don't have excuses for that; 
there really is no excuse," Fife said. "I

There was nobody pushing me

s looking to get out of 



Ball State and a couple of 
schools from the west coast. 
Macias settled on IPFW due to 
the school's reputation, Ball's 
status as a top tier coach and 
that the Mastodon program 
would offer what Findlay was 
lacking. 

"When Matty Matty (2005 
graduate and former 



Matt Zby^/ewski) 
graduated, it left a big void in 
our team. And youdon't fill voids 
of fifth year seniors with high 
school kids coming in unless 
they are really exceptional," 
Ball said of his expectations for 
Macias coming ir 



So Macias made his 
Mastodon debut and it was 
obvious from the beginning that 
he was going to be a primary 
contributor. He had 14 kills in 
his first match in the Mastodon 
blue and white. He followed 
that with matches of 1 1 , 13 and 
17. When the team made its 
first road trip of the year, he 
tallied up 23 kills against Lewis. 

Recently, he slammed home 
a career-high 38 kills at Ohio 
State. All of the performances 
have helped him lead the team 
in kills, currently with 417. 
Macias is on pace to end the 
regular season with 571 kills, 
which would put him sixth 
on the school's all-time single 
season kill list. 

But Macias remains humble 
and still refuses to put himself 
ahead of his team. After all, it is 
that combined with hard work 
that brought him here. 

"Those don't show how you 
are on the court and compose 
yourself and take care of the 
team," he said. "They are just 
numbers." 

So for now, he will continue 
to contribute. He will spend his 
next seven matches on the court 
of Hilliard Gates Sports Center.

i Sophomore nansfer C.J. 
Macias has emerged as IPFW 
volleyball's next big thing 



It was April 23, 2005 and the crowd inside the 
Hilliard Gates Sports Center rose to their feet 
and began to clap. It was the first round of the 
MIVA Tournament and IPFW were on game point 
— one kill from eliminating Findlay. 

On one side of the net, a Findlay freshman 
named C.J. Macias stared across at the IPFW 
players, thirsty in his own right for a MIVA win. 
It would be the last game he would ever play in 
Oiler orange. 

' ' e that night 
i that same 

The beginning and ending to his most recent 
journey all come back to the same place - IPFW. 
And if you ask Macias, it's not an all together 
riveting tale. But since coming to IPFW as a 
student-athlete, it is his shining on the court that 
has made Macias into a story himself. 

That story is based on hard work, something 
that started long ago for the laid back Florida 



life full of

In 2002, Macias was named Second Team All- 
Broward/Dade County and the following year 
he made a First Team appearance. In his senior 
season, Macias was named the County Player of 
the Year. And then came decision time. 

"When I first decided I was going to play in 
school, all 1 kept saying was 'I don't want to .go 
to the Midwest,'" Macias laughed. "Findlay was 
the only school who made an offer that I could 
afford. So 1 had to choose between living by the 
ocean and living college life that I always thought 
about and playing volleyball."

in as an Oiler, Macias racked 
up 536 kills and was second in the MIVA in points 
per game and kills per conference game to IPFW 
graduate Matt ZbyszewskJ. 

But things in Findlay were not what Macias 
wanted. After his season ended, he looked at 
the possibility of transferring out of the school. 
But he never got the chance to do so. lust as he 
was looking into returning to the school, Findlay 
discontinued its volleyball program.
