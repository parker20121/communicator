Child care services to merge 



ByCAROLKOENIG 

Staff Writer 

IPFW, the Fort Wayne State Developmental Center, and Indiana Technical 

College will combine efforts and open a child care center when final approval is 

given by all parties involved, say university sources. ' 

The center, which has been under discussion since June, 1985, will be housed in 
the basement of Carroll Hall at the Developmental Center, 49O0 St. Joe Road. 

IPFW has offered child care services lo its faculty, staff, and students since 1973. 
Thecurrent center occupies five rooms in a building at the intersection of Stellhom 
and Hobson Roads. 



The children are cared for by a trained staff that has worked together for about 
seven years, according to Jean Kauffman, director of the child care center. 
Students from the Indiana Vocational Technical College child care program also 
provide valuable assistance at the center, said Kauffman. 

The center serves about 150 children, aged six months to ten years, during a 
typical week, said Kauffman. 

Parents must register their children with the child care center if Ihey want lo use 
its services. The hourly charge is $1.50 for the first child, and $1.25 for each ad- 
ditional child in the same family. 

Officials of all three state institutions said they will release more information 
when Ihe merger is finalized. 



Motherwell, first student to participate 
in Leadership Fort Wayne program 



By M1CHELE R. SHAFFER 
Managing Editor 

On Jan. 10, Joseph Motherwell, IPFW 
student body president, officially set a 
record in Fort Wayne. 

On that day, Motherwell joined other 
citizens of Fort Wayne in the 1986 
Leadership Fort Wayne program. 
Motherwell was selected as the first 
student to participate in Leadership 
Fort Wayne, a local program aimed al 
bettering the quality of leadership in 
Fort Wayne. 

Motherwell was selected as a par- 
ticipant in Leadership Fort Wayne, 
which is co-sponsored by IPFW and the 
Fort Wayne Corporate Council, based 
on his interest in the development of 
Fort Wayne and his past and present 
al filiations Motherwell said lie applied 
and his acceptance was based heavily 
on his activities. Motherwell presently 
serves as IPFW student body president. 

In addition to his role as student body 
president, Motherwell serves on 
committees in Students Government, is 
a member of the Student Resources 
Committee, of the Search' and Screen 
Committee for an IPFW Chancellor, 
and the Business Student Advisory 
Board. He has been named to the 
Dean's List and the Honor Roll, and has 
been active in the past with the Big 
Brolhers-Big Sisters program in Fort 
Wayne. He also has been active on the 
Student Union Board of Governors 
i.SUBOG) and the IPFW Biology Club. 

Motherwell had Lo name three 
problems Fort Wayne has and offer 
solutions lo these problems as part of 
his application. He said he felt 
economic development was a major 
problem locally. Fort Wayne needs lo 
build a "more diverse economic base 
instead of one or two major economic 
sectors" lo avoid recurring incidents 
like the crippling wake Harvester left 
behind when the corporation pulled out 
of Fort Wayne. 

Secondly, he said there was a need to 
re-emphasize social programs — to re- 
emphasize the needs of the elderly and 



the poor In lieu of federal funds, 
Motherwell explained, "it looks like 
cities are going to have to pick up the 
slack for the poor and homeless." 

Finally, Motherwell said he felt very 
strongly that community resources 
need to be developed "Fort Wayne 
money should be kept in Fort Wayne as 
much as possible to encourage local 
firms to grow," said Motherwell. Ac- 
cordingly, if this problem and solution 
were followed, there would be limited 
outside consultants. The aim, ac- 
cording to Motherwell, is lo utilize 
resources at hand, rather than wasting 
dollars lo pay consultants from cities 
like Boston. An example Motherwell 
cited was the Boston consulting firm 
hired to research the proposed 
Headwaters State Park. 

Motherwell said a compelling reason 
behind his community involvement is 
his background. "As a life-long Fort 
Wayne resident, I am interested in ... 
the growth and quality of life of our 
city," said Motherwell, 'i look forward 
to becoming more formally involved in 
community affairs." 

Leadership Fort Wayne holds a series 
of seminars, 80 percent of which the 
applicants must attend. Fine arts in 
Fort Wayne, financing public 
education, vocational education, the 
United Way, and business development 
in Northeastern Indiana are just a few 
subjects the applicants study in their 
endeavors to improve Fort Wayne. 

Leadership Fort Wayne aims at 
developing community leaders, ex- 
panding — through the program — the 
leadership potential of applicants, 
improving communications among 
leaders, providing a channel for access 
to leadership opportunities in the city, 
and fostering a commitment to a life of 
community service. Sylvia Neely, 
assistant professor of history, and 
Marian Adair, assistant director and 
coordinator of counseling and testing 
services, are both graduates of past 
Leadership Fort Wayne classes. Both 
women are employed by IPFW.

"There was more communication regarding the needs of the community this 
year; the campaign was better organized," Newell said. This year, group 
leaders were appointed so all full-time employees could be contacted about 
giving, while in previous years the chairman was the only person to solicit. 

The chairman for 1985 was the late Dr. Carl E. Bickley. 

The goals ol this year's campaign were to increase the number of individuals 
participating by 15 percent and to increase the dollar amount given by seven 
percent 

As of Oct. 24, there were 318 individuals who had given a total of $19,897 This 
was 40 percent higher than 1984 giving. Additional giving pushed the total past 
$20,000. 

One-half of the full-time faculty and staff at IPFW participated in the cam- 
paign this year, compared to 27 percent last year. This was a 76 percent in- 
crease in participation, said Newell.

It's time to set goals, 
work together in 1986 



Setting goals, (jetting a fresh start on 
a new year, and a new semester. 

IPFW community members, from the 
International Students Organization to 
the Greek organizations and the 
chancellor's office, should challenge 
themselves to reach further, than they 
have before — for the pursuit of 
excellence at IPFW. Fort Wayne is 
pulling itself out of 'a recession. 
Companies are moving to Fort Wayne. 
New companies are establishing 
themselves. This is our opportunity now 
to show these people "what we're made 
of." 

These new companies could bring in 
new job opportunities to IPFW 
graduates. We challenge the department 
chairpersons to advertise the excellency 
of their programs. Invite your junior and 
senior majors in, along with company 
representatives, to meet each other. 
Show them the advantage of hiring local 
people — people who have been educated 
here who know the community's likes 
and needs. 

We challenge student organizations — 
all of them — to try even harder to let 
people know they even exist. That is a 
big challenge, we realize that. However, 
by taking it a step at a time, it could be 
surmountable. Begin with the local 
campus. Make up posters describing 
your organizations. Have poster runs — 
go in groups and hang them around 
campus. It doesn't have to be a 
drudgery. It can be fun. 

We challenge the search and screen 
committee to find a candidate who is 



wide open to new ideas and who knows 
how to manage people well. He should 
have the ability to take on the 
responsibility of bolstering IPFW's 
image in the community. 

The administration, from the vice 
chancellor's office to the deans of 
science and humanities, and arts and 
letters, and the dean of students; should 
keep the student's needs in mind. Forget 
for once how something will enhance 
your career, Isn't this an esteemed 
institution of higher learning, where 
your purpose is to educate fertile, young 
minds, and in our case fertile, and 
sometimes, very experienced, mature 
minds? 

IPFW students and faculty are 
involved in all sorts of activities: the 
Embassy Foundation, The Fine Arts 
foundation, the Red Cross, The 
Chamber of Commerce, The 
Philharmonic, The Fort Wayne 
Historical Museum, as well as several 
business associations. Students are also, 
for the most part, employed either full- 
time or part-time. Let us show Fort 
Wayne that IPFW is not full of educators 
and students who go to school and do 
nothing else. 

In summary, we challenge everyone to 
strive to enhance the image of IPFW. 
This is not the "by-pass high" as so 
many people used to refer to it as. This is 
an established, great combination of two 
of the best universities in the nation. 

Let this All-America city know we are 
an All-America college yearning greater 
recognition and respect. 




Businesses, institutions 
working smoke-free 



-Letters to the Editor 



What do the Lincoln Life Corporation 
offices, The Journal-Gazette newsroom, 
and IPFW classrooms have in common? 
They are all non-smoking areas in major 
institutions — places that have banned 
smoking. 

The trend to restrict smoking in the 
working area is spreading throughout 
the United States, brought on by the 
health and fitness trend of the '80's. 
. Office s, in particular, have caught the 
ball in preventing disease like 
emphysema and lung cancer that are 
caused by cigarette smoking. 

The Communicator supports the effort 
to ban smoking in the work place. 
However, we do recognize that it is a 
person's right to smoke if he so desires. 
This right, though, often infringes on a 
non-smoker's right to clean air. 

The solution to this situation is simple: 



create a smoking employees' lounge in 
the workplace. Lunch and coffee breaks 
could be spent by smokers in the privacy 
of this lounge while the non-smokers 
enjoy their free-time in a cigarette-free 
environment within their lounge. 

Allowing workers to smoke at desks or 
work tables is unfair to the non-smoking 
fellow worker, in addition to being 
dangerous. A forgotten cigarette could 
burn and smoulder for hours under some 
long-forgotten, finished work. 

Restaurants recognized the need to 
separate smokers from non-smokers 
early on, dividing dining facilities into 
distinctly separate areas. 

It's up to the leaders in the business 
and institutional worlds to define the 
rules for smoking on the job, Don't leave 
it until it's too late...

Cantor rebutts 

To the Editor: 

I want to respond to the 
rather curious letter from 
Linda Banks Williams (The 
Communicator, Dec. 12, 
1985). It is quite curious to 
me because, although it was 
written to sound like an 
evaluation of my "Protest 
Movement of the Sixties" 
class, the writer of the letter 
was not even a student in the 
classr-odd, indeed, given the 
rather authoBfaBve.tone of 
what she had to say Even 
more odd is her reference to 
my "pervasive sexism," in 
light of the Tact that she was 
not around all semester to 
find out what, if anything, 
pervaded. Ms. Williams 
should consider becoming 
a historian herself — the 
profession certainly needs 
people with her uncanny 
ability to produce vivid 
recreations of past events 
which she did not witness, 
and of which she has only the 
faintest, most anecdotal 
knowledge. 

I'd like to continue in this 
vein, but I feel I must get 
serious long enough to 
condemn both the general 
lone of the letter (which was 
inexcusable, given the 
author's not being in the 
class) and the reference to 
"other concerned students 
and faculty" in the closing. 
Since her name was the only 
one which appears, 1 assume 
that she was the only person 
who actually si; 
letter. Both Judy Dilorio and 
Mike Nusbaumer, sociology 
faculty, have told me that 
Ms. Williams came to them 
with the letter before it was 
The Communicator. 
and they suggested that she 
see me to talk about the 



problem. She did not. Both 
have vociferously denied 
any further role in the 
matter, and both share my 
regret over its publication. If 
there are other students and- 
or faculty who were involved 
in the writing of the letter, I 
have been unable to locate 
them. If there are, and if 
they have a problem with the 
way I teach the course, I 
would welcome their first- 
hand, informed criticisms. 

Just as Ms. Williams' 
claim to speak for "other 
concerned students and, 
faculty" lacks support, so 
does her complaint about 
"pervasive sexism" — a 
claim supported solely by a 
reference to my failure to 
include specific women's 
names as suitable topics for 
term papers on "Leaders of 
the Movement." 1 did indeed 
fail to list women by 
name— and when several of 
my women students pointed 
this out to me during the first 
class meeting, I thought 
theirs was a very good 
criticism. I certainly will list 
women leaders by name the 
next time I offer the course. 
This was the first time I had 
taught the class, and I made 
an honest, if clumsy, 
mistake We all need a little 
sensitizing now and then, 
even us old-fashioned 
liberals left over from the 
Sixties. 

The students in my class 
made very good suggestions 
of specific women leaders. 
(Actually, I thought the list 
provided by Ms. Williams 
was quite good, though the 
thought of Twiggy as a 
protest leader does tend to 
boggle the mind). A number 
of students took topics in the 
category "Women's Rights 
and the Movement," and a 
few did excellent papers. 



Interestingly enough, 1 had 
more term papers on women 
in this class than in any other 
upper-division class I have 
ever taught. This is what is 
so baffling. Why should Ms. 
Williams, who was not a 
student in the course, wait 
until the end of the semester 
to write this kind of letter 
about a matter my students 
and I assumed had been 
closed at the first day of 
class? Sheri Wilson, who was 
a student in the class and 
who is probably as sensitive 
, to, feminist issues as nearly 
anyone around these days, 
stopped by after seeing the 
letter to express her baf- 



flement as well. 

After all this befud- 
dlement, however, Ms. 
Williams did make an effort 
to clear up one mystery for 
me— the reason for a decline 
in the number of students 
majoring in history. My 
sexism, she writes, is the 
cause. I applied what I now 
call the Williams Theory to 
the trends in declared 
majors in other departments 
in Arts and Letters, and 
found that there are fewer 
English majors, geology 
majors Tt]l fine-arts majors, ' 
library-science majors, 
foreign-language majors 
and sociology majors than 



there were five years ago. 
Worse yet, surveys indicate 
that there are fewer students 
minoring in women's studies 
than there were two years 
ago. I hope someone stops 
me before it's too late.

Typographical errors painful 



Big daddy misprint 



book 



Ruth's sex therapy 
has been recalled 
; of the misprint — 
"The safe times are the 
week before and the week of 
ovulation." I think that's 
supposed to read 'the week 
of MerdiGras.' 

I know, the correct word is 
"unsafe" — and we wait 
with anticipation the birth 
later this year of those 7 lb. 
bouncing baby typographic- 
al errors. 

As we say in standup 
comedy, it's all in the the, 
the uh, er, uh — timing 
Whether you've read Dr. 
Ruth's book or not, it helps to 
have a natural sense of 
rfaythm. 

And what about the 
computer which caused the 
typo? Let's just call it, 
"Dad." 



Watch it Kadafi! 



Now that the Gipper has 
had It up to his kelster with 
Kadafi the flaky barbarian, 
what's next? Why, more 
lame excuses from our flaky 
allies, of course. 




Great Britain says terribly 
sorry — they hope we un- 
derstand but sanctions 
against Libya are a dreadful 
bother. That's the ap- 
preciation we get for 
recently going goo-goo, gah- 
gah, over Princess Diana 
and pretending that Charles 
is exciting. 

Hey, Charlie — next time 
you want help pulling your 
little Falklands out of the 
fire, call a Libyan. ' ' 

And as for our traditional 
ally, Germany — we un- 
derstand how you feel. By 
the way, got anymore 
cemeteries you want 
dedicated? 

So, the next act of 
terrorism, Kadafi, look out. 
One more after that and 
you're past tense. Or, maybe 
the one after that — 
definitely the very next one, 
Five, four, three, two, one, 
six, five, four, three.. 



Don't exploit it! 



Let us immediately outlaw 
in advance the following 
observations of Martin 
Luther King's birthday 
before they take hold: 

Exploitive advertising 
"He had a dream and so can 
you at Glotz's Martin Luther 
King Birthday Sale" 

School closing nu &gt; There li- 
no evidnece that Dr, King 
ever said, "Someday little 
children will stay home from 
school on my birthday and 
hang out in shopping malls 
and see the movie 'Kiss of 
the Spider Woman.'" 

An Official Proclamation 
in Congress— unless the 'I 
Have a Dream' speech is 
read by Sen. Jesse Helms. 



Flicks fare well 



Movies did very well over 
the holidays and "Out of 
Africa" is one of the best. 

Unfortunately, the title does 
not refer to apartheid. 

"Spies Like Us" was not 
filmed at a Navy reunion — 
however, "Back to the 
Future" has been considered 
as a slogan for the Gary Hart 
campaign. 

Anyone betting on whether 
or not there will be a "Rocky 
V"? I'm waiting for "Rocky 
XI" in which a 65-year-old 
Stallone, addled by too many 
blows to the head, demands 
a rematch with Jack 
Dempsey. 

Question: Would a sequel 
to "101 Dalmations" be 
called "101 Dalmatians II" 
or "102 Dalmations"?

Today, smart homeowners are relying on new, natural gas 
space heaters to add warmth. Not only as a matter of

and money on their heating bills. .especially when used 
to supplement expensive, electric resistance, oroil heat.

By MARY HARMAN 
Staff Writer 

If you're searching for an 
entertaining break from the 
same old routine this 
weekend, then the United 
Cerebral Palsy "Weekend 
With The Stars" Telethon 
and its related activities and 
events, may be just what 
you're looking for. 

The telethon, featured on 
WPTA-TV Channel 21, will 
begin this Saturday, Jan. IB 
at 11:30 p.m. and continue 
through 7 p.m. Sunday, Jan. 
IB. 

The annual telethon, 
already in its eighth year, 
will be hosted nationally by- 
John Flitter along with an 
array of today's most 
popular performers. 

Along with providing first- 
rate entertainment, the 
program also provides 
public education and in- 
sights into what cerebral 
palsy is and how it can be 
prevented. 

Although the telethon is 
nationally aired, one of the 
most exciting things about it 
is the local involvement here 
in Fort Wayne. According to 
Pete Battistini, local 
coordinator of the telethon, 
UCP (United Cerebral 
Palsy &gt; of Indiana will be the 
local recipient of funds 
raised, with eighty-five 
percent of the proceeds 



remaining in Fort Wayne for 
support of local and 
statewide programs, ser- 
vices, and activities. 

Deborah Starks, a student 
at IPFW, has been named 
assistant coordinator and 
publicity chairperson for the 
telethon. Starks' respon- 
sibilities include assisting in 
the coordination of the 
telethon as well as working 
at the television station 
during the telethon this 
weekend. 

In conjunction with the 
national telethon, many 
local activities and events 
have been slated at 
Southtown Mall to raise 
extra donations. 

Several phooths set up 
around the mall promise a 
tot of fun. Among them are a 
face painting booth headed 
by Kate Greven, an IPFW 
communications major. The 
face painting booth will be 
located near center court, 
and for a two dollar 
donation, she and her crew 
will transform any face into 
a clown, rock star, or any 
other creative design 
requested, the booth will be 
open from noon until eight on 
Saturday and from noon 
until fiveon Sunday. 

The highlight of the 
telethon activities, and 
definitely the most talked 
about is a "Kiss the Pig" 



contest developed by Pete 
Battistini with the help of 
IPFW's Pi Beta Phi 
Sorority. In case you haven't 
heard, six local celebrities 
are vying for the televised 
honor of kissing a genuine 
snorting, oinking pig. 
Displays have been placed at 
sixteen area Pizza Huts by 
members of Pi Beta Phi 
featuring six voting can- 
nisters. one for each of the 
lucky contestants. The 
"votes" themselves are 
donations collected from the 
cannisters with one penny 
equalling one vote, one 
dollar equalling one-hundred 
votes, etc. 

According to Jenny 
Blakley, a member of Pi 
Beta Phi, representatives of 
the sorority will be present 
at Southtown Mall's center 
court with the six con- 
testants on Sunday around 2 



UCP Last year over $700 
was donated by Penney's 
through a similar perm sale. 
If a perm isn't what you're 
looking for but a good cut 
and style is, then check out 
Regis at Southtown on 
Sunday. Regis is sponsoring 
a Cut-a-thon with haircuts 
beginning at just five 
dollarsl One hundred per- 
cent of the money raised 
from the Cut-a-Thon is 
donated directly to UCP. 

UCP is a non-profit 
organization dedicated to 
improving the quality of life 
for people affected by 
cerebral palsy. The 
remaining fifteen percent of 
the funds raised goes to the 
national organization for 
research and national 
legislative efforts. 



Since the overwhelming 
majority of funds raised in 
Fort Wayne stay in this 
community, strong local 
support is needed for this 
fund drive to be a success. 
Channel 21 's Jane Hersha, 
Jim Brady and Jay Walker 
have once again donated 
their time to host local 
segments of the program. 

With the wide variety of 
entertainment, activities 
and events featured during 
the "Weekend With The 
Stars" telethon, UCP has 
definitely produced 
"something for everyone," 
This is your opportunity to 
break your usual weekend 
routine and do something 
different and exciting, while 
helping to improve the 
quality of life for someone 
else.

Black Collegian Caucus is an active service organization 



By MICHELLE M. BANDOR 
Staff Writer 

Remember last semester when a bag of freshly popped 
popcorn was ell that kept you conscious between classes at 
Kettler? Chances are that Ihe Black Collegian Caucus was at 
your service. 

For the last twenty years, the BCC has served the IPFW 
campus and the Fori Wayne community in many exciting 
ways. The BCC fills its calendar with a variety of programs 
and activities that stimulate the intellect as well as offer 
relief from eye-straining study . 

Among its past involvements was the attending of the 
Black Family Forum sponsored by the Fort Wayne Urban 
League and the NAACP. 

The BCC's involvement is also extended to area high 
schools. Its Academic Task Force informs students about 
FPFW academic programs and general college preparation. 



The BCC promotes community involvement and seeks to 
enhance the skilb of its members as well as share resources 
with the IPFW campus and community. 

In January, there will be a "Know Your Heritage" contest 
on the IPFW campus. Besides being Black History Month, 
February brings a pizza party, a "Southern Goods" bake 
sale and a luncheon with black alumni. 

Other upcoming events include the BCC Academic Task 
Force sponsoring an Education and Career Day Workshop 
for Fort Wayne Community and South Easl Allen County 
schools. The workshop is "geared toward Black and other 
students of color." 

The BCC will also be working with Mr. Joe PR. Tape of 
the Afrique-Amerique Trade Office on presenting "A Day in 
Old Africa." The goal of the presentation is to promote an 
economic and cultural awareness of Africa to the people of 
the Midwest. 



If you are a student and want to be involved in community, 
social and personal progress — not to mention good times — 
think about becoming a member of the Black Collegian 
Caucus. 

Currently, membership stands at twenty, with Patrice 
Shade serving as president; Michael Edmonds, vice- 
president; Lolita Williams, treasurer; and Patricia Dowdell, 
secretary Advisors to the BCC are Pamela Elliot, John 
Ulmer and Reid Nelson. 

The BCC provides members with quarterly subscriptions 
to black collegian magazines. The members meet every 
other Monday in Kettler G51 at noon for rap sessions on 
selected topics. 

For more information regarding the black Collegian 
Caucus and upcoming events and activities, contact Patrice 
Shade She can be found in her office in the first and second 
cubes on the second floor of the Walb Memorial Student 
Union Building.

By TONY DUNAWAV 
St alf Writer 

Dec. 11 — In IPFW 
basketball action, the Lady 
Mastodons trounced the 
Lady Cougars of St. Francis 
College by the score of 69-42.

with 15 points, led a balanced 
attack that saw four Lady

figures.

Grand Valley State, 78-64, in

scored 15 points and led the 
Lady Mastodons over Lewis 
56-54 in their first GLVC 
match-up of the season The

very cold start and trailed 
10-2 Five minutes into the 
game with both teams 
playing very physical The 
Lady Mastodons finally 
pulled ahead midway into 
the second half after 
scratching their way back to 
claim a 22-22 tie at the

ByTONVDUNAWAY 
Staff Writer 

Dec. 10 — The Mastodons,

Cougars kept the game 
close, trailing by only three 
(37-34) at ha If time.

leading scorer with 18 points 
and rebounder with seven, 
was Schann Leathers. 

Dec. 14 — Tri-State 
downed IPFW, 78-58, in a

with 12 points. 

Dec. 23 — The Mastodons 



were defeated in their first 
GLVC match-up by Lewis 
College, 55-52 in overtime. 
IPFW played a slow game 
the whole way and went to 
the locker room at the hail 
tied 24-24, and 47-77 at the 
end of regular play. The fans 
had the opportunity to see 
the only college in the nation 
with four brothers on the 
same team, Mark, Joe, Tom 
and Charlie Niega for Lewis, 

Dec. 30 — Coe College lost 
lo IPFW, 69-45, in the

stead of his normal forward 
position, and Schann 
Leathers scored a game high 
IB points each. 

Jan. 2 — The Mastodons 
traveled lo Kentucky 
Wesleyan and were soundly 
defeated, 95-63. Scott Reed 
was the leading scorer for 
IPFW with 10 points. This 
was their second GLVC loss. 

Jan. 4 — Northern Ken- 
tucky downed the Mastodons 
in their next GLVC match, 



79-62. Lawrence Jordan 
scored a game high 14 points 
for IPFW. 

Jan. 11 — The Mastodons, 
playing without senior guard 
Dave Lutes, hosted Ashland 
College and lost their fourth 
GLVC game in a row. The 
Eagles won 75-73 in over- 
time. After a slow start, the 
Mastodons came from a 
seven point deficit and led by 
as many as five points until 
the last couple of minutes of 
regulation when the 
Mastodons hit a cold streak, 

In a short interview after 
the Ashland game, a 
frustrated Coach Russell 
staled, "We're playing very 
inconsistently and we can't 
seem to hold a lead when we 
get it. We have to learn how 
lo win and right now our 
players are lacking con- 
fidence." Coach Russell 
added, "About the only 
positive thing I see right now 
is that we are young." 

IPFW will host Indiana 
Central on Jan. 16 at 7:30 
p.m. 



seconds remaining in the 
game to score the winning 
points, and Bev Miller iced 
the game by canning two 
more free throws with just 
four seconds to go. 

Jan. 11 — The Ashland 
Eagles came from 12 points 
down in the last 11 minutes to 
defeat the Lady Mastodons, 
67-66. The Lady Mastodons 
had a hard time getting 
anything to fall through the 
hoop in that 11 minute 
stretch as they could only 
add 7 points during the 
Eagles run. The freshman 
duo of Lynn Meinerding and 
Terri Lydy combined for a 
total of 39 points and 25 
rebounds in a losing cause. 

The Lady Mastodons are l- 
3 in GLVC play and 6-6 
overall. At this point Coach 
Calahan feels, "The girls are 
hard to watch right now 
because they are so up and 
down, inconsistent. They are 
making a lot of mental 
mistakes " On the subject of 
the holiday schedule, Coach 
Calahan said, "We played 
very poorly in Kentucky. 
Whereas the referees have 
called many games loosley 
this year, in Kentucky the 
games were called very 
closely and our girls just did 
not adjust to it. Overall, we 
could very easily be 9-3 or 
even 10-2. We just have not 
developed the mental 
toughness that is needed at 
this level." 
The Lady Mastodons have
