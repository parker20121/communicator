How to become President 




A time for all things. 



For everything there is a season, 

and a time for every matter under heaven: 

a time to be born, and a time to die; 

... a time to kill, and a time to heal; 

... a time to weep, and a time to laugh; 

... a time to seek, and a time to lose; 

... a time to keep silence, and a time to speak; 

a time for war, and a time for peace, 

a time to love, and a time to hate. 

What gain has the worker from his toil? 




BEST

knew Tampax tampons 
were your best bet. They're 
the only tampons to come

young girls get started. 

Tampax tampons always 
keep you feeling tresh, 
clean and comfortable. 
And you always feel se cure, 
too, because you BEH 
knowthey'resoftly WM 
compressed for the tSEm 
best absorption. You like 
the assurance that nothing 
shows when you wear them 
and that you can't feel them. 
You carry them discreetly. 
You dispose of them easily. 
You know that they're your 
besl bet when you're 
buying sanitary protection. 

But did you know 
Tampax tampons were also 
your best buy? They come 
t economical packages ol 
O's and 40's, yet cost 
about the same as other 
brands that package 
8sand30's, 

Tampax tampons are 
your best bet. And they're 
also your best buy.
