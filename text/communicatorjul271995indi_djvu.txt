Students discover 
tons of laughs 
at Brew Ha Ha 



One or the many activities that college students 
enjoy is drinking beer. With this being summer, most 
of the parlies have died down and the recreational 
palate quenching is at a standstill, until now. 

The Fort Wayne Museum of Art, Munchie 
Emporium and Finkelman's almost Kosher Deli 
along with 98.9 The Bear are hosting this year's Brew 
Ha Ha. This event will take place on August 13, 
from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. at The Munchie Emporium on 
1109 Taylor Street 

Ticket sales have been really good, according to 

Kim Casper-Burke, volunteer coordinator. "We've 

sold about 400 of the 500 we bad to sell." Tickets for 

this event are $15 for the articulate member and $20 

for all others. Tickets 

may be purchased 

at Munchies or 




able at 
l b 
door. 
The beer 
tself will 
ge from 
forty different 
kinds from all 
around the 
world. All beer will 
come in bottles. "A few examples are Belgium Ales. 
Axnstel, Reitz Wicked Ale, and Heineken," said Mark 
Melchie, manager of Munchie Emporium. 

There will be door prizes as well as entertainment 
in the evening. 

Brew bags will be handed out at the door. These 
bags consist of kits to make your own beer. Also a 
trip to Frankenmuth, Michigan, complete with hotel 
accommodations, and a VIP tour of the Frankenmuth 
Beer Factory will be given away. 

Entertainment will be provided by the Scurrilous 
Blaggards, a folk style band. Food will also be avail- 
able from the Munchies menu. 

"Beer lasting is a hot iiem for young people," said 
Casper -Burke. "This is just a unique way lo attract 
people (o a fund raiser. 1 think that it will be a fun 
activity to do," she added. "Everyone likes to drink 
beer, especially young people." 

The Emporium had other reasons for helping with 
the Brew Ha Ha. "We wanted lo help with charily 
work thai would benefit the museum. It involved 
beer, and il would be a good way to open up the new 
deli in ihe back of Munchies," said the manager. "It's 
a neat way lo do a grand opening." Melchie said.

Police and Safety vows to protect, serve, educate 



Chief of Campus Police Lauren Denhartog 
reports low crime rate 

by Melissa Young-Flores 
News Editor 

Ten officers, four security officers, and an office siaff ensure ihe safety of the fac- 
ulty, students, and visitors on campus. Those men and women have vowed "to pro- 
tect and serve the campus community by providing a safe environment through 
enforcement, service, and education." 

According lo Chief of Campus Police Lauren Denhartog, the department works 
very hard to live up to its mission, Denhartog said police and safety offers a variety 
of services including, personal escort jump starts and safety education. 

Denhartog said students and faculty should take advantage of the services the 
department offers, especially the personal escort service. "1 encourage people to use 
this service. It is bere. It is free. We'd rather be safe than sorry." 

There are also 22 emergency phones on campus to assisl a victim in need. He 
reports all of the phones are checked weekly to ensure they are in working order. 

The campus, however, maintains a very low crime rate. "We are very fortunate 
that we have very few problems." said Denhartog. 

The department is well trained and could handle any major situation, be said. A 
decade ago the average experience of the department officer was two and half years, 
but today's force averages 22 years of experience. 

"The officers now know how to handle any siluation that may arise," said 
Denbartog. 

Prevention, according to Denhartog, is a key element in deterring criminals. He 



attributes the success of ihe preventative measures in pan to the Physical Plant "The 
Physical Plant is wonderful. They have done an excellent job on improving some of 
ihe areas on campus thai could have been a problem," said Denhartog. 

The department also reaches out to educate the campus on alcohol and safely. 




Each year the department hosts Alcohol and Safety Awareness Week. In the past 
information booths were set up in Keitler Hall, personal safety classes have been 
offered, and mock trials demoastrated the consequence of drinking and driving.

Fort %ne citizens, police reclaim city 



Chief of Police Neil Moore attributes the 

success of Target 2000 to good officers 

and concerned citizens 





by Melissa Young- Flores 
News Editor 

In a ciiy of 175,000 people, crime and tragedies are bound to surface. With gang 
violence and drug-related crimes filling the nightly news and morning papers, 
police departments across the nation have been forced to create plans of action in 
order to combat die growing anarchy. 

Plans have been developed for the Fort Wayne area by the police department 
and concerned citizens. Target 2000: Community Policing has become one of the 
police departments main plans to knock drugs off of the streets. 

"Within our community policing effort, one of the things we did was orga- 
nize citizens," said Fort Wayne Chief of Police Neil Moore. 

According to Moore, the city was divided into five quadranLs, and with the 
help of neighborhood associations, the police department was able to compile a fairly 
accurate composite of drug houses. Moore said the department (hen compared ihe list 
to known and strongly suspecied gang members. He reports the citizens' list almost 
completely matched the list of gang members. 

The Community Policing plan entails five phases which begin with targeting 
the infected areas and end with evaluating the effectiveness of ihe effort. 

Under the saturation patrol phase of the plan, a minimum of four two-person 
teams and one supervisor patrol ihe target area. Officers are instructed lo "stop traffic 
wilhin legal means," according 10 Moore. 

"One of the things it does is give the officers a chance to talk 10 tbe driver 
and observe to see if there is potential harm," said Moore. 

Moore said the department also compiled a lisi of activities and violations 
which officers were instructed not to tolerate. The list includes street drug dealing, 
potential gang activity, gun calls and the noise ordinances, 

Moore said many people are shocked officers have been (old to pull over 
anyone violating noise ordinances, but he contends tbe citizens from the southeast 
quadrant listed loud music as a primary nuisance and a signal of possible foul activi- 
ties. 

According lo Moore, Fort Wayne is borne lo 500 confirmed gang members 
and 1 500 suspected gang members. "Righl now we range from about 42-50 gangs." 

"We're doing several things right now thai go after gang members," said 
Moore. In order lo combat Ihe growing number of gang members and gang-related 
crimes, six to eight officers focus on nothing but gang involved youih said Moore. 

Moore said policing and bringing down drug dealers will not completely 
solve the long-ienn problems, "I think parents would be a little more responsible if 
they were more aware of what lo look for," said Moore.

Study links incest and substance abuse 



Researcher hopes 
counseling methods will 
change to accommodate 
incest victims 

by Melissa Young-Flores 
News Editor 

A siudy released earlier this year indicates a direct 
correlation between substance abuse and incest 

Noreen Glover, who received her doctorate from the 
University of Southern Illinois at Carbondale for ihe 
study, said, "I feel primarily what we are focusing on is 
a disease model instead of substance abuse seen as a 



i of a problem which is often incest" 

Glover, who also leaches a course on counseling al 
IPFW, said her research was spurred from working at a 
substance abuse clinic. Glover said approximately 90 
percent of the women at the clinic reported incest 

Glover completed her masters thesis on the correla- 
tion and then moved on to ber dissertation. Glover's 
thesis has been published in the Journal of 
Rehabilitation and Counseling as well as ihe Substance 
Abuse Journal. She is working to have her dissertation 
published within the next year 

According to Glover, most professionals arc 
unaware of the problem and those who are aware are 
not properly trained to handle tbe siluation. 

"I think a lot of counselors are unaware and those 



who are aware are not trained and they feel ihey cannot 
treat it appropriately," said Glover. 

Glover believes that adequate substance abuse and 
incest training is still not part of the average curriculum. 
"I don't think students are going to be sufficiently 
trained today, but I'm hoping ihey will be in the near 
future." 

"I do lake one class period to discuss substance 
abuse and sex abuse and that includes incest" said 
Glover, who incorporates the issue into ber class cur- 
riculum. 

Glover said she hopes ber study will be a tool of 
information and learning to the public and hopes thai 
ihe counseling community will soon use ber treatment 
model.

The Communicator 



Student Activities director 
wants to 'empower students' 



Thursday, July 27, 1995 



by MelUta Young-Flore* 
News Editor 

(Jn July 1, a new face joined the 
IPFW faculty. Kim Jacobs look ihc 
reigns from former Sludcni 
Activities Direcior Greg Callen. 

"IPFW has some really great 
people who work here and some 
really great students. It is a wonder- 
ful environment," said Jacobs, 

Jacobs said she believes the year 
has gotten off to a good start. "I 
walked into a very good setting. 



SAD has their fall activities pretty 
much set and I've got three really 
good officers." 

She said she wants to get out and 
meet the students on campus and 
obtain their input. "From what I 
hear, my style is going to be really 
different from my predecessor," 
Jacobs said. "I want to empower 
students to make things happen, and 
we will look at all ideas." 

According to Jacobs, Ihc office 
of student activities will help make 
[he student organizations and activi- 



ties more visible. "My goal in the 
first year is to up the visibility of 
activities on campus." She said. 
"The more visible you make activi- 
ties, the more students will know 
what's going on." 

Jacobs said she does not intend 
to make major changes within the 
department until she has had more 
lime to review how ii is currently 
functioning. "I don't know that I 
see big changes. I like to gel a feel 
for things first." 



Police continued from page 1 

Denhartog said although the 
dale for this year's safety aware- 
ness week has been set for Oct. 16 
through Oct. 20, Ihc events arc still 
in Ihc planning stages. In part, 
community involvement will deter- 
mine the success of Ihc education 
campaign. 

The department has not gone 
unrecognized for its participation 
on campus and in the community. 
This year MADD commended the 
department for its alcohol and safe- 
ty awareness program with a 
plaque of appreciation. IPFW also 
earned a place on the National Seat 
Dell Honor Role. Denhartog reports 
70 percent of Mastodons buckle up. 
"I think students appreciate us 
and lhat has changed. Years ago, I 
don't think we were appreciated as 
much in part due to ihe community 
and in part by us. We do our best," 
said Denhartog.

School of Fine Arts plans 
trips to Chicago, Toledo 



Moore reports the department is 
trying lo bring a firm from 
Minneapolis that specifically deals 
with educating parents lo Fort 
Wayne. 

Police misconduct is not 
unknown to the Fort Wayne police 
department, and although Moore 
admits the possibility of police cor- 
ruption could surface in his depart- 
ment, he staled ihe officers main- 
lain a high moral code. 

"Our police department is a very 
good police department with 
integrity and a low number of inter- 
nal disciplinary actions." he said. 



said. "We want people to have trust 
in us, and we know if we have offi- 
cers that are corrupt it can erode 
that trust." 

Moore earned his masters from 
IPFW and has instructed a SPEA 
course since 1986. "I was asked to 
instruct an undergraduate course 
and I enjoy it," Moore said. "I 
enjoy Ihe contribution I can make 
to ihe students." 

Moore is currently working on 
his doctorate, and is wailing for his 
dissertation lopic of community 
policing lo be approved.

The school of Fine and 
Performing Arts will be offering 
opportunities to see classic an 
work in two upcoming nips. First, 
a bus will be going to ihe Chicago 
Art Institute to sec an exhibit enti- 
tled "Claude Monet. 1840-1926." 
Later, a trip to the Toledo Museum 
of Art's "Made in America: Ten 
Centuries of Art" exhibit will be 
made. 

On Sept. 16, participants will 
see 159 of Monet's works. This 
includes some never before dis- 
played pieces as well as pieces 
from private collections. One high- 
light will be seven paintings from 
Monet's House of Parliament 
series, created while he stayed in 
London during the beginning of the 
century. Also displayed will be a 
triptych, a water lily painting from 
the Museum of Modem An, which 
is rarely loaned. The schedule 
allows for plenty of free lime. The 
cost is $42. 

A trip to see "Made in America: 
Ten Centuries of Art" is planned 
for Oct. 21. The exhibit reflects 
America's spirit and life over the 
years through paintings, pho- 
tographs, sculptures, and other 
works. Also are included furniture, 
silver, glass and Native American

U.S. wimps out 
in Bosnia 



"All n lakes for something bad 
10 happen is for good men to do 
nothing." So said one historian long 
ago, and that statement is still true 
today. The United Stales (and the 
rest of the economically prosperous 
West) Is doing nothing while 
Serbian nationalists commit geno- 
cide in Bosnia. 

While some conflicts simply 
need to expire by themselves, the 
time to simply let the Yugoslavian 
civil war peter out has long since 
passed. 

Many opponents of military 
involvement cite the Vietnam dis- 
aster for slaying out. While (here 
are similarities, this is still a sepa- 
rate conflict. If the American mili- 
tary machine, or better yet, a coali- 
tion similar to the one in action 
during the Gulf War. entered with a 
clear goal and a feasible plan to 
obtain that goal, peace in Bosnia 
could be won without the endless 
skirmishing or staggering casualties 
which plagued the services in 
Vietnam. 

The United States drummed up 
some courage to wage the Gulf 
War on enemy soil just earlier this 
decade. For the naysaycrs in the 
media who predicted a protracted 
conflict with the heavily armored 
Iraqi army, coalition forces, led by 
the United States, hammered 
Saddam's army to rubbish without 
the combat loss of a single lank. 



Why can't our politicians find it in 
their hearts (and their gut) to rescue 
outmanned Eastern Europeans from 
religious oppression, something we 
are protected against by our 
Constitution? 

Earlier this year, we celebrated 
the fiftieth anniversary of the end 
of World War II. That date signi- 
fied the lime, just half a century 
ago, the U.S. still had the sense of 
international responsibility and the 
intestinal fortitude to fight against 
tyranny on other continents. What 
has happened in the last fifty years? 
Have we morally degenerated 
enough that just two generations 
ago we could send sixteen million 
men into the world's largcsl-cver 
conflict and now we can't see off a 
quarter of a million men to a 
remote flare-up? 

One must wonder whether or not 
the U.S. and its allies would be in 
the Balkans if a valuable commodi- 
ty was at stake (say, oil or national 
security).

Like 
many 
Americans, I 
honored our 
nation's birth- 
day a couple of 
weeks ago in 
thoughtful 
reflection, as I 
pitted two nov- 
elty Fireworks 
against each 
other: the Giant 
Mutant Egg- 
laying Hen and 
the Shooting Tank. One might 
think that the Shooting Tank would 
have the upper hand, since it can 
scoot, shoot, and it is after all, a 
lank. But, just as in real life, the 
Egg-laying Hen left the Shooting 
Tank a twisted burning wreck. 
Thankfully, this was only a simula- 
tion. 

Had I not been so absorbed in 
testing our nation's defense strate- 
gy against Giant Mutant Hens, I 
might have bowed my head in 
silent respect for the true patriots of 



this country — the brave people of 
New Hampshire. Every four years, 
the unselfish citizens of this state 
sacrifice their holiday so that the 
rest of the country is free from 
grandstanding presidential candi- 
dates. Already they have descended 
on New Hampshire; true, they are 
fewer than usual, but in a state 
about the shape and size of a pizza 
slice, it must still be hard to miss 
those candidates, running around 
kissing hands and shaking babies. 

Really, the primaries, and for 
that matter the presidential election, 
is mere formality. Like it or not, 
Bob Dole is the next president. By 
now Lamar! Alexander must real- 
ize that his Jugband Jamboree cam- 
paign style was maybe a lillle too 
folksy. Phil Gramm has created 
enough fuss that he might end up as 
the vice president, a horrible fate he 
so richly deserves. And Pat 
Buchanan is superb in his role as 
the Embarrassing Nazi Sideshow 
Geek. 

Although I always vote, I can 
sympathize with those who don'L 



After all, as a Democrat in Indiana, 
what will my vote do? And what's 
the real difference between being 
able to vote for one of two weasels, 
and being able to vote for one 
weasel, as was the case in the old 
communist Soviet Union? 

America really isn't that special, 
and yet it is. Let me explain: all 
civilizations have always had some 
sort of royally, nobility, aristocra- 
cy, or whatever you want to call 
them. Our special little country, 
however, explicitly bans nobility in 
our constitution. But since our 
country is really not that special, 
we made up our own aristocracy: 
movie, television, sports, and music 
stars. And, further blurring the line 
between mere celebrityhood and 
the divine rights of royalty, our 
beloved nobles are now obligated 
to take part in political causes. 
Several sports, movie, and music 
stars are even in congress. 

People really only resent nobles 
when they arc no longer amusing; 
then the nobles are beheaded and a 
new, more entertaining noble class 



is formed. Another social fallacy is 
that people are incensed when free- 
doms are restricted — in reality, 
nothing politically motivates peo- 
ple more than a crusade to restrict 
freedom. People are scared by the 
burden of freedom and will even 
fight and die to ensure that the stale 
will limit their options in life. 
While many revolutionaries and 
politicians will claim to be fighting 
for freedom, they are always, ulti- 
mately, fighting for money. 

Little of ibis really matters, 
though America only seems like 
one of the best countries in the 
world because, unlike so many 
other nations, it is basically a two 
party dictatorship. This, combined 
with the fact that Americans have a 
relatively long fuse when it comes 
to starting civil wars, makes the 
U.S. one of the better places to live. 
Most people of the world live under 
some single party dictatorship, 
which, although efficient, is never a 
good thing. We. however, live in 
perpetual chaos; we boast the most 
inefficient, wasteful, slack-happy 



government in the world. Our two 
would-be despotic regimes arc so 
busy ridiculing each other that nei- 
ther has time to actually accom- 
plish anything, other than babble on 
about diversionary issues like flag- 
burning and prayer in school. 

Lately, however, Americans 
have become so polarized and li.nr 
filled that our balanced system of 
doing nothing is becoming serious- 
ly threatened. Americans have 
always been united in their resent- 
ment of government; it's become a 
sort of national pastime But the 
toxicity of these partisan attacks 
has never been so intense since, 
say, the 1850's. If the next genera- 
tion of elected foots aren't careful, 
our little experiment with democra- 
cy in America might just go down 
in flames like a Giant Egg-laying 
Mutant Hen.

enforcement community is an 
abomination to all legitimate cops 
anywhere. I was soocked to see 
signs bearing the words "nigger 
check point" and the sale of "nigger 
hunting licenses" and firearm tar- 
gets of black men with afros. In the 
past, those law enforcement offi- 
cials bad to wear white robes and 
hoods: now racism is a nationally 
sponsored seminar somewhat simi- 
tar to a Star Trek convention. By no 
large leap of faith. I have serious 
thoughts about the testimony of 
Officer Mark Fuhrman. The O.J. 
case, through the efforts of the 
defense, has lasted long enough to 
give people more reason to distrust 
the judicial system and hate 
lawyers. 

With this in mind, could it be 
true? Could the OJ. Simpson trial 
be half over? Is the defensive 
"Dream Team" of Robert "lawyer 
to wife-beaters" Shapiro. Johnny 
"everybody's racist" Cochran, 
Barry "bullshit-smearing slug" 
Scheck and F. Lee "the 
Constitutional buicber" Bailey fum- 
bling the ball while presenting their 
case? I have a feeling no one will 
be reading this story because you 
are just as tired of the case as I am. 
But the sheer incompetence of the 
defense overshadows the ill prepa- 
ration of the prosecution. 

The witnesses that have been 
called for the defense have been 
laughable even more so than Kato. 
the professional bum, and Rosa, the 



housekeeper. O.J.'s doctor, who 
was called recently, told the defense 
OJ. could nol have committed the 
murders because of his arthritic 
knees. Thirty minuies later, Ihe 
same doctor said it was possible for 
O.J. to savagely murder Ron 
Goldman and Nicole Brown 
Simpson. Personally, my favorite 
moment from the defense is when 
the prosecution rebutted the defense 
argument about OJ.'s arthritis. The 
prosecution aired the OJ. Simpson 
workout video which was taped 
four days before the murders. In 
another brilliant legal move by the 
defense, the door was opened to 
allow another video tape of 
Simpson making a testimonial 
where he said his knees no longer 
hurt him. In all fairness to the 
defense, they assumed with the past 
history of the LA. prosecution 
office that they would not have to 
present a case. 

Considering California's recent 
history, the best place to kill your 
parents, savagely beat a black man 
for a moving violation or decapitate 
your ex-wife and her waiter/lover is 
in the greater Los Angeles vicinity. 

My limited understanding of the 
judicial system consists of the 
belief that all men are innocent until 
proven guilty. Unfortunately, in 
California, lawyers and jurors 
believe all white men are innocent. 
Black men could be innocent as 
long as they have enough money. 

Race even played a large role in 



the Susan Smith case. Many people 
were jazzed off because they bad 
been had by Susan's lies about the 
black carjacker. Her admission of 
the lie caused people to look at their 
own racism inside their heart. The 
outrage people felt towards Smith 
was partly because of her crime, but 
also people fell they had been suck- 
ered. 

Luckily, Smith has been convict- 
ed of murder and will pay for her 
crime. If she would have killed her 
14 month-old son and her four year- 
old son in a California lake. Smith. 
like the Menendez bothers, would 
still be in trial. She could, theoreti- 
cally, have gotten off because of the 
mental anguish caused by her step- 
father's abuse. 

Even Leona Helmsley, who has 
money coming out of places on her 
body that she never knew existed, 
was found guilty. Why? Because 
the case was in New York and no 
matter how awful New York City 
may be, at least their district attor- 
neys can convict someone with 
money. 

Justice can be found in America; 
the problem is knowing were to 
look. Here is some free advice to 
any criminal in Indiana — pack up 
your luggage and move to L.A. 
Rent a U-Haul, better yet steal it, 
you won't get caught unless your 
house guest is Kato.

Ho 



hy Testa (inchinutt 

H Guest Writer 
I have always believed the 
wriMen word transcends all 
other form* of expression. The 
writer has Ih,: power to create 
the most aesthetic truths to bis 
or her own design. There is 
nothing else in the world. 
Movies based on a novel never 
seem to completely capture 
what the author created in writ- 
ten words. Then a movie like 
"The Bridges of Madison 
County" comes along and 
destroys my wonderful little 
theory (upon which I bad 
based my existence). I cringe 
upon writing these words, but 
the movie, surprisingly, was 
better than the book. I will 
never be the same. 

"The Bridges of Madison 
County" is based on the novel 
written by Robert James 
Waller, Meryl Slrccp plays 
Francesca Johnson, a house- 
wife who has been uprooted 
from Italy to Iowa to live a life 
of comfortable routine. She 
loves her husband and her two 
children, yet feels a certain 
void within herself. Her "life 
of details" leaves her craving 
something more. When Robert 
Kincaid, charmingly portrayed 
by Clint Eastwood, walks into 
her life and he changes her 
reality forever. Kincaid is a 
phoiographer who wanders 
around the world, "making pic- 
tures." He is an artist and he 
leaves his mark in Franocsca's 
heart. He shows her who she 
truly is. The plot is simple: 
they have an affair while [he 
husband and kids arc out of 
town. Four nigbis of bliss. 
Francesca chooses to stay with 
her husband, because she does, 
indeed, love him and has chil- 
dren to raise. Although the 
bond between her and Robert 
will never be severed, she goes 
on with her life. 

The plot seems irrelevant. 
What mailers is the underlying 
message, the thematic impor- 
tance of the story. Francesca is 
afraid of change. Robert per- 
sonifies change. He completely 
alters her life and her self 
image. She admits, "I was act- 
ing like another woman, yet I 
was more myself than I was 
ever before." He gives her a 
taste of what she has always 
dreamed of as a child: a fairy 
lale life of romance and adven- 
ture. Robert opens up a part of 
her heart that she has never 
seen before. He doesn't create 
this new facet in her life, be 
just takes a photograph of it so 
thai she may see it and treasure 
it until death. 

The most striking aspect of 
this beautifully crafted movie 
is the subtlety with which even 
the most powerful emotions 
arc expressed. Love and desire 
are spoken in glances and the 
body language is so blatant it 
screams. Although Eastwood's 
acting is superb and the cbcm- . 
istry is arousing, it is Steep's 
performance that carries the 
movie. She elegantly portrays 
a believable version of the 
Italian woman, mingling timid- 
ity and the inevitable deference 
to the man, with intelligence, 
wit, and strength of character. 
You cannot help but stare at 



her. Every movement she 
makes, every expression, every 
blink of her eyes tells a story. 
Why speak when you can feel? 

There is one scene in the 
movie that pounds in my mind: 
Francesca and her husband are 
driving home. It's pouring 
down rain. Kincaid is in front 
of them as they wail for the 
light to lum green. The turmoil 
brewing in Francesca's heart is 
evident as if she faced with the 
hardest decision of her life. 
Her band is clasped on the 
door handle of her husband's 
truck. She hesitates, torn 
between reality and change. 
Her husband complains about 
the "stranger" who is still 
stopped at the green light. 
Kincaid finally drives away, 
leaving Francesca with (be 
"life of details" she has cho- 
sen. She realizes everything 
changes in time. What she 
found wilh Kincaid will 
remain powerful and pure in 
her memory, in her heart 

Certainly, Francesca loved 
both Kincaid and her husband. 
This movie captures the com- 
plexity of such conflicting 
emotions. There is no guilt, 
blame, or remorse for the adul- 
tery committed. We forget she 



cheated on her husband. We 
forget she lived the rest of ber 
life holding a secret passion for 
another man. She deceived her 
husband. She lied. Yet that 
doesn't seem to matter 
because, as human beings, we 
can understand the unrelenting 
power of genuine love. 

Still, I am troubled by the 
sacrifice that Francesca seems 
to make by letting go of this 
beautiful connection that she 
has found. Did she do the right 
thing by staying with her bus- 
band? Was she driven by fear, 
by duty, by love? Did sbe act 
out of selflessness or cow- 
ardice? I do not completely 
understand why my eyes 
welled up with tears as I 
watched the final scenes. I 
wanted Francesca to follow ber 
heart. And perhaps, in the end, 
she did. She kept the pho- 
tographs, in their pure and 
unchanging form. Sbe also 
kepi a lengthy journal describ- 
ing all that occurred between 
her and Kincaid. This journal 
(ells the story. 

The written word is. indeed, 
the core of all that is important 
After all, the actors are just 
pretending.

be true? After spending an hour 
with him, I found him to be good, if 
not great, and true. This is the intcr- 
wiew that became of that hour. .. 

Paul Tupper: For those who do not 
know, what does your job email? 
John Parrish-Sprowl: In part, I am 
still finding that out. But essentially 
I am a member of the faculty, so I 
do research and teaching, as docs 
every member of the faculty. My 
teaching load is somewhat reduced 
because of my administrative 
duties. I am involved in handling 
■ the administrative aspects of the 
department. Those kinds of paper- 
work issues related to hiring, evalu- 
ating faculty, scheduling of courses, 
coordinating faculty meetings, and 
all of those kinds of things. 

P.T.: Why do you think you are 
good for this job? 

J.P.S.: I have a lot of administra- 
tive/ managerial experience, 
although this is the first time I have 
been a department chair. And I 
hope that I bring a good record of 
scholarship and leaching to the 
department so I can be of assistance 
and resource to the rest of the facul- 
ty and department. And I also bring 
an enthusiasm for the job. I want to 
do it. A lot of people in academia 
don't want lo be department chairs. 

P.T.: I have talked to a few people 
who are department chairs simply 
lo keep certain other people from 
the position. 

J.P.S.: Well fortunately, that's not 
the case here. I like everyone. I 
think there were particular reasons 
why they went outside of the 
department, but of course, my being 
new, there's a clean slate with dial 
sort of thing. I am happy to be at 
IPFW. This is a good opportunity 
for me. 

, P.T.: I know you've only been here 
for a couple of weeks, but if you 
were a student, what would you tell 
another student that you like best 
about IPFW? 

: J.P.S.: I can only speak to the 
Communication Department, but all 
of our faculty are high quality. 
People who are active scholars, 
people who arc doing their very 
best to be the best teachers they 
know how to be, to improve. And I 
think that you can gel a communi- 
cation education here that is current 
in terms of theory and research in 
our discipline, and is highly useful 
and functional for those folks who 
hope to translate this degree to 
some kind of abilities in the work 
place. 

P.T.: Is there anything you think 
this campus needs to improve itself? 
J.P.S.: My understanding is, and 
this does not surprise me, that like 
all commuter campuses, it needs 
greater involvement by people in 



various student activities. Because 
it enhances quality of the totality of 
their education. It makes it more 
than just courses. 

P.I '.: When someone chooses com- 
munication for a major, what can 
they expect? 

J.P.S.: I think they can expect 
something that reflects the nature of 
our field There'll be a broad vari- 
ety of theoretical perspectives that 
are developed as resources for the 
student. There is a broad array of 
research that goes along with that, 
and a strong focus on practical skill 
related lo theory and research. And 
I think it will be my sincere hope 
that when students graduate with a 
communications major that they 
will feel more knowledgeable, more 
intellectually capable and more per- 
formance capable as a communica- 



P.T.: Is there afield of communica- 
tion that is weak at IPFW? 
J.P.S.: I think there arc probably 
specialized areas of our discipline 
thai wc don't teach here. And in 
that sense we are weak. But if we 
were to be weak at it, then we just 
choose not to do it. An example of 
that would be Health 
Communication. Some programs 
have a strong emphasis in it, we do 
noL Wc don't have the people here 
whom that's their primary exper- 
tise, as near as 1 can tell. You 
should do what you do well or not 
do it at all. That being said, we do 
represent a broad spectrum of tal- 
ents across our faculty. 

P.T.: Is there an area that looks 
most promising ? 

J.P.S.: Different people define the 
discipline differently, so I could 
probably get into trouble from some 
people for this, but as see it those 
areas related lo media and organiza- 
tion are probably our strongest 
areas. Those, at a professional point 
of view, are the most important 
areas. Wc have good rhetorical 
studies in media, good social sci- 
ences in media good leaching areas 
of production in media and media 
criticism. 

P.T.: If I were to come to this office, 
how can I be sure that you will give 
me some effort regarding my situa- 
tion? 

J.P.S.: I guarantee you that I will 
make every effort. We are here for 
students. Without students, we 
would have no business. Any stu- 
dent that has an issue, concern or 
problem that can be addressed to 
my office are free to come here any 
I will help them in any way I can. I 
am not particularly secretive about 
my work methods, so students can 
double check me. 

P.T.: What are you doing to liven 
spirits here in the wake of Shannon 
Lutz' s murder? 

J.P.S.: I have the peculiar advantage 
of not actually knowing her. To 
some degree, that distance is helpful 
in terms of making my own affect. 
And we know communication has 
systemic effects, in part by injecting

people from the outside the imme- 
diate system that's going to change 
the system. I don' t dwell on it much 
because I wasn't here when it hap- 
pened. 1 did not know ber. I don't 
want to sound cold or callous 
because that sort of thing is frightful 
and scary no matter what the cir- 
cumstance is or no matter who it is. 
But it also makes a difference by 
how much wc know a person. 
Bringing people in from the outside 
helps. 

P.T.: Do you approve of 
student/professor friendships or 
otherwise outside of class? 
J, PS.: 1 am going to avoid that 
word "approve" and just give you 
my opinion. Can faculty and stu- 
dents enjoy friendships? Of course 
they can. They're people. I have 
several former students I maintain 
friendships with and hope to find 
students that I maintain long-term 
friendships with here at IPFW. If 
you arc in a romantic entanglement, 
there can be some controversy. My 



with ih.ii have to do with 
abuse of power and sexual harass- 
ment. It not only steps on legal 
problems, but serious ethical issues. 
I think any student that walks into a 
class deserves a legitimate educa- 
tion With respect to relationships, 
you cannot make universal rules. I 
wouldn't say that someone should 
never have that kind of entangle- 
ment. What I would say. for me as a 
chair, it has a high risk potential for 
problems. 

P.T.: What is it that you do to 
escape? What is it that you do to 
relax? 

J.P.S.: Probably my number one 
method for escape is reading mys- 
tery novels. I haven't bothered 
developing hobbies because work 
takes up so much of my life. 

P.T.: What would you like to say to 
the readers of The Communicator? 
J.P.S.: I am really happy to be at 
IPFW. I think we have a great com- 
munication faculty, and if we do 



things right, we'd like to know If 
you have any problems with this 
department, please feel free to let 
me know and we'll do our best to 
make things right. And don't be 
bashful here.

Thursday, July C 







Guesl speaker William Strickland speaks al a CAP. On 
Violence seminar in Walb. The program promotes Ihe use of art 
and creativity to detour at risk youth from gang activities and crime. 



Ilalen continued from page 4 

ihcir in .in. rii: nis and leapt into the 
crowd. A louring ritual must for 
Barbra. 

When it came time tt&gt; meet Van 
Halen, my nerves were shot. I bad 
butterflies in my stomach and my 
words had escaped me. What can 
one possibly say to entertainers of 
their stature? The people from 
Warner Brothers lined us up, like a 
firing squad, to shake the hands of 
the stars. A brief moment was 
allowed for picture -taking before 
we were rushed out the door. Not 
an extremely personal encounier, 
but 1 was happy nonetheless. 

This brief time freeze gave me 
loads of memory. 1 was taken by 
their normality. They were doing 
human things! Sammy Hagar put 
his aim around me during the pic- 
ture, but all I could think about was 
the aroma of mouthwash surround- 
ing him. 

My biggest goal was to look at 
Eddie's hands. I wanted to remem- 
ber the instruments with which the 
master works. They were disap- 
pointedly average looking bands. 
What a shock! But it is this I will 
remember most about the meeting. 

Show time. 

Opening for Van Halen was 
Skid Row. The last few releases by 
Skid Row have failed to' duplicate 
the success "Youth Gone Wild," 



cm 

can keep your love alive 



"Eighteen and Life," and "f 
Remember You," This is not the 
fault of their stage performance. 
Lead singer Sebastian Bach was 
excited and energetic, a great com- 
bination for wanning a crowd. It 
worked and the band was great, 
despite the F word dominating each 
line 

The stage darkened in anticipa- 
tion of the true attraction, Van 
Halen, Magic illuminated the empty 
stage as Eddie began playing a riff 
on his guitar. This marked tbe 
beginning of an amazing show. 

Tbe band played songs from 
every faze of it's incarnation, rang- 
ing from "Jump" to the closing 
"Right Now." There was a wide 
margin of ages at ihc show, bring- 
ing generations together for an 
event, not just a concert. 

Visual effects and big screens 
completed the extravaganza. But 
the music was the center of atten- 
tion. The only sad part of the con- 
cert was seeing Alex Van Halen, 
the group's master drummer, in a 
neck brace and Eddie standing still 
as he must do until bis hip replace- 
ment surgery. 

I left the show a happy fan. I 
was not alone. The entire crowd 
seemed to have as good of a time as 
I. This was love.
