Students will gel an unprecedented 
two-day brcaJt In february. 19BS, ac- 
cording lo the tH-as academic calendar 
recently passed by Ihe Faculty Senate. 
The break, however, caused some 
controversy in the Senate during the 
dralling process of ttw calendar 

The semester will begin August 17.

January ID. 13&amp;S. Students will get a 
break February 31-22. However, 
weekend college students will sllll be 
retjuircd to attend February 23-21. 
Spring break is tentatively scheduled 
Irom March 29 lo April 8, The semester 
will end the week ol May fi. 

A proposal to schedule I hi- spring 
break al the middle of the semester was 
defeated because it did not coincide 
with the spring break lor the Fort 
Wayne Community Schools. 

Supporters ol the February break say 



Rudy G Svoboda, assistant dean o( 
science and humanities, opposed the 
break because the spring semester will 
start two days earlier. Besides cutting 
two days Irom Christmas vacation. 
Svoboda said the early starl may cause 
difliculties in academic advising. "We 
lopponenls of the break' felt the price 
to tic paid vas too great," he said. 

Harold W Davles, chairman of 
biological sciences, said the two-day 
break "will make 11 awkward for some
