World 
issues 
among 
topics 
of forum 

by Carrie Ann" Leathers 



Since ihe laic 1970s, the anthro- 
pology forum ha.1 been bringing Mu- 
denis and faculty together for week- 
ly discussions. 

Iliis year, for ibc first lime in 
over 20 years, the group has recom- 
bined with sociology. 

The weekly Wednesday sociol- 
ogy/anthropology forums are free 
and open to students and others 
imcresled in topics ranging from 
discussions on mummies to terror- 
ism and also violence in ihe world 

"The professors can talk about 
what they feel is imponani," student 
Kaiby Clark said. "They don't have 
lo follow a curriculum." 

Some of ibe topics already dis- 
cussed this semester included clergy 
malfeasance and blood sacrifice in 
conlemporary Mcsoam erica. 

"We try to gel cunent research 
or something interesting (for the 
forum)," Professor of anthropology 
and head of the forum Alan 
Sandslrom said. "Anybody-faculty 
or students, is welcome to come. ' 

Only four forums are left this 
semester, the next session covering 
the conflicts in Albania and 
Kosovo. 

"Professor Bern Fischer (of his- 
tory) jusl relumed from Eastern 
Eun^," SaruLstrom said. "He is 
going to discuss the dangers there 
and whether or not it could grow 
into a large war." 

Also planning to speak is 
Chancellor Michael Wartell. who 
will discuss lefTOrism in the mind's 
of Americans, He will point out the 
difference in perception and reality 
on the thoughts of terrorism. 

"Whai 1 am going to talk about 
is Ibe public view of terrorism and 
bow the media has portrayed it. " 
Wartell said. 'There's a difference 
of perception between terrorism and 
the actual threat of tenorism," 

Human perttplions relating lo 
terrorism fits in well with both 
anthropology and sociology 
thought. Wartell. who lectures on 
issues related to terrorism, will also 
discuss the actual Uueai of tenor- 
ism. 

"Also, (1 will talk about) how we 
would respond if we would have a 
threat of terrorism in our own coun- 
try," Wariell said, "It should be 
interesting for anyone interested in 
current politics and events." 

The forum meets every 
Wednesday in Walb Union 114 at 
noon. Fliers po.sling the upcoming 
topics can be found throughout the 
campus. 

"We guarantee that it will be 
something fascinating," Sandslrom 
said. "And, you'll learn something." 
For more information, the soci- 
ology and anthropology department 
can be reached at 481-6842.

Water line leaks 
necessitate repairs 
on campus grounds 



by Brian Long 



LinSoofie prion Eiiui 

The sawhorses above are placed on the sidewalks throughout campus, becoming a 
familiar reminder of the maintenance on the water system. 



Slaff Writer 

There are currently three main- 
tenance projects pending completion 
on various sites around campus, one 
between Keitler and Neff, another 
near the Helmke library, and the 
mhcr near the new parking garage. 

fhese projects all are concerned 
with water lines. 

Between KetUer and Neff, there 
was a break in a domestic water line. 

This line supplies water to both 
KetUer and Neff. 

The break was not serious and 
did not interrupt the functions of the 
buildings. 

The cooling systems at IPFW 
are based on a chilled water 
principle. 

This means very cold water is 
supplied to each building from Uie 
Chiller Plant. 

The water is then piped to all the 
buildings on campus and runs 
through the walls and ceiling to keep 
them cool. 

This system leaves pipes brittle 
and more prone to breakage. 



In the 70s, when the water sys- 
tem was installed, there was a cost 
issue. 

The campus is now paying die 
price for an outdated system, with 
about two chilled water leaks every 
year, and a domestic water line 
break every three or four years, 

"In the nem five to ten years, 
someUiing needs to he done. It is 
very difficult to build because the 
pipes are buried eight feci in the 
ground. Water can travel a long way 
before reaching Ihe surface." said 
Dave Daiiielson, director of the 
Physical Plant. 

The consiruciion near the new 
parking garage has nothing to do 
with leaky pipes. 

!l was necessary to lap the water 
line to irrigate the grounds in that 

Starting next spring. IPFW can 
expect to see some nice green grass 
in that area. 

Danielson offered this assurance 
about the construction. 

"We'll try to fix the breaks as 
they come up and inconvenience 
people as little as possible " 



Program lightens load on classroom costs 



by MLsbanna Wood 



Netvs Editor 

in the spring semester IPFW student govern- 
ment will be offering rental for T183 graph- 
ing calculators at SIO a semester 

Nick Gray, a student senator on the stu- 
dent aff^s committee, heard about the idea in 
class from Everett Sauders, math associate 
faculty. 

The students were complaining that S90 
to SlOO was very expensive for a piece of 
equipment to be used for one class. 

Student government is donating 52000 



toward the calculator program. 

According to the proposed plan, students 
can begin renting calculators with an instruc- 
tion manual during die first week of the 
semester from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the student 
government office, Walb 225. 

After the initial week, students will still 
be able to rent calculators at the convenience 
of the student government office by calling 
481-6586. 

All materials need lo be returned by 
Saturday of the last week of the semester. A a 
S5 fee will be charged for each each late 
week. 

"Although, one may pay S85 in late fees, 
it's not yours," Gray said. "You have to pay a 
remaining balance," he added. 



The details of a rent lo own program are 
in the process of being constructed, 

'The courses we teach ate calculator- 
related. When 1 can't require a calculator, it's 
difficult as a whole for studenLs to leam. It 
would he a lot better if they all had the same 
calculator," Sauders said. 

Gray has been working to get the program 
accepted into the campus with a.ssisiance from 
John Lamaster, math instructor, and Donna 
Bialik, dean of students, since the spring 
semester of 1998. 

AtlhelPSGAmeeling on Monday. Nov. 16, 
the final step for the calculator program to be 
formally accepted will be discussed with Dan 
Gebhan, business manager of student activi- 
ties and student organizations. 



"We arc 90 percent 
certain at this point." 
Gebhan said. 

The final step is to 
make sure the student 
government renting 
policies and the Student 
Government contract 
coincide, 

"It's a great kind of 
support program for 
students who don't' 
have the resources to 
buy a calculator," 
Chancellor Michael 
Wanetl said.

Lean on Me' principal advocates persistence 



Famed speaker 
stresses the 
importance of 
family values 

by Carrie Anne Leathers 

Chief Reponer 

"If you arc to receive the best, you must 
give your best and if you give your best, the 
best must come to you. You must stoop lo lift 
mankind up." 

Such was the philosophy expressed by Joe 
Clark Tuesday night, Clark was the last lec- 
turer for this year's Omnibus Lecture Series. 

Since die early 1980s, when he began as a 
principal of Easlsidc High School in New 
Jersey. Clark has continued his efforts to 
reform and better not only the educational sys- 
tem in America, but also students and people 

Clark led an overflowing room of listeners 
through his leaure and spent time answering 
the questions of the audience and even speak- 
ing to individuals afterwards. 

"To students, 1 say 'be persistent,'" Clark 
said. "The greatest trait is persistence and 
determination." 

Although Clark has been featured in Time 
magazine, written his own book, and was the 
inspiration of the movie "Lean on Me." he 
explained that this is not what makes a person. 

He believes Uiai every individual must 
strive to be all that he or she can be as a per- 
son, not from a measurement of possessions. 

"Many of us are afraid to do the things we 
were put here to do," Clark said. "We go 
tluDugh our lives afraid of things that do not 



exist This keeps us from reach- 
ing the heights that we can 
reach," 

Relating to school discipline. 
Clark pointed out that students 
mu,si not be given any slack. i 
He pointed out diat today in 
America, more and more African 
American students arc faiUng to | 
succeed in life 

"If there is no discipline, then 
learning cannot take place," 
Clark said. "We need to get 
tougher — people age 15, 16. andl 
17 know that they shouldn't kill 
and if they do, they should take I 
their medicineV 

Clarit pointed out that many 
of Ihe African Americans in the 
country do not have families 
involved in the schools and with 
the education of their 
children. 

"Family values are indis- 
pensable," Clark said. "1 told my 
children one diing — college or 
die. Children today must have 
community and family support in 

order lo survive and succeed " 

During his lecture. Clark 
brought students of all ages onto the stage to 
recite a pledge from him. 

It encompassed his behef that one individ- 
ual can, and must make a difference. 

"I am only one, but 1 am one," Clark made 
diem repeat "I can't do all things, but 1 can do 
some and that which I can do. I ought to 
do..." 

One area student, who recited die pledge. 
took from Clark's lecture the importance of 
staying off the streets and slaying away from 
drugs and in school. 

"He taught us about how to keep kids 




I am only one, but I am one 
can't do all things, but I can do 
some and that which I can do, 
I ought to do." 



-Joe Clark 




away from dope and crack and in school," 
said sixUi grader of Lane Middle school Curtis 
Ellis, "What I learned is that the important 
thing is to go to college and stay in school 
and, do good." 

Clark told die audience that seven years 
ago, he was near dying and had open-heart 
surgery. 

He quoted what his grandfather told him 
ai diis time. "The righteous have no time to 
die. They decide when they want lo die." 

Clark explained that he decided not to die 
and has continued pushing his beliefs in mak- 



ing good use of hfe since this incident, 
"Be bold. Take life on," Clark said. 
"Replace the fear v/ith strength and Ihe 
despair with hope, and the powerful forces 
will be inside of you." he added. 

Most of all. Clark expressed his strong 
belief that everybody must contribute to the 
country and world in order to be a better per- 
son and make the worid a better place. 

"Gel up off your rusiy-dusiy because 
nobody is going to do for you what you should 
do for yourself." Clark said."

Topic: 

The campus 
image, and its lack 
thereof 

What we think: 

There are some 
things that we can 
try that could make 
this campus better 



Lei us siaii off by saying (hat noi 
everything is wrong wiih ttii; campus. 
While ihere are a number of things thai 
wc are going to mention Ihat possibly 
need changing, we warn lo acknowl- 
edge some of the positive things that 
are going on with the campus- 

We have a great number of excel- 
lent professors that are complemented 
by the administraiion. The campus is 
well-kept and always looks clean. Ii 
seems as if the bomb threats have 
almosi complelely stopped, thanks to 
Police and Safety 

Our campus has a great library, and 
computer facilities on campus are con- 
stantly growing, making the informa- 
tion available lo students almosi 
endless. 

There is now a student government 
thai has been trying lo make things bet- 
ter for all of US- All of this is hunky- 
dory, but here are some more deeply- 
rooted problems with our campus 

IPFW's image needs to change. 
What do you think of when you think 
of IPFW? Take a minute to ponder it. 

Do images of basketball games and 
volleyball games go through your 
head? Probably not Do you see one 
image that personifies the campus? If 
you do, it is more than likely either a 
mastodon or the IPFW logo on the slate 
of Indiana. 

What we're afraid of is that when 
you think of your time here ai IPFW, 
you think of all ibe classes and how 
you had a hard time staying awake in 
them. 

Or. you could think about how 
lonely you were because you weren't 
involved in anything here on 
campus. 

There has to be something we can 



do to spark an interest in the campus so 
we could leave someday with great 
memories. 

We have come up wiib a few things 
that will, in our humble opinion, 
improve the image of the campus. Here 
are just a few general suggestions, but 
for any of it lo work, there has to be 
some kind of action taken. 

First off, the school's name isn't 
Indiana Purdue Fort Wayne, is it? We 
thought it was Indiana University 
Purdue University Fori Wayne, 
Wouldn't a better way to say ii be 
"lUPU Fori Wayne"? 

This would get rid of all of Ihe neg- 
ative connotations thai come from the 
acronym IPFW such as "I Paid For 
What?" Ii would be like the oiher 
Indiana University and Purdue 
Universiiy satellites such as lUPUl, 

Next, bow about getting rid of the 
mastodon for a mascoi? Do we really 
want an exlinct, slow animal represent- 
ing our leams? We can jus! imagine our 
cross couniry team running in slow 
motion up againsi a team running at 
top-notch speed. 

Shouldn't our mascoi be something 
thai is a little more athletic and up-to- 
date? If we want to have something 
that is extinct, why don't we use 
Sabertooihs or Rapiors or something 
else? It's good 10 want to have a differ- 
ent mascoi name, bui even Sports 
Illustrated listed our mascot as one of 
the mosi unusual. Although "unusual" 
might have a positive connoiation, 
"extinci" really doesn't. 

One name thai we liked was the 
Falcons, It's a swift and wild animal 
that is also very marketable. What we 
should do is take the mastodon and 
move it to the new Science Building 
and name it Masiodon Hall. 

Another idea wc had was lo change 
the school colors 
from blue and white, 
which are common 
school colors, 
Universiiy of 
Saint Francis' 
school colors are 
blue and while and 
Ivy Tech uses ihose 
colors for their 
adveriisemenls. 
Why don'i we try 
something different? 
The original colors 
of IPFW were crim- 
son and gold. Those 
two colors represent 
a color from each of 



our parent colleges. 

We think that it would be much 
more attractive and make us stand oui 
from the rest, li would make us appear 
as though we are different from the rest 
of the universities around the Fort 
Wayne area. 

Another thing ihat our campus is 
lacking is a monument recognizable lo 
all students We have plenty of small 
monumenis around the campus, but 
there isn't one that symbolizes a uni- 
versity mission. 

One ihing that we came up with is 
to have some kind of monument pui in 
the middle of the roundabout. 

The subject of dorms on campus 
has also been passed around for 
decades. We don't think it will happen 
any lime soon, and there are some pos- 
itive sides to having them. 

Since we are a commuter campus, 
most studenis spend very liitle time on 
the campus. If we were lo have dorms, 
this would change. The school environ- 
ment would turn into one much more 
like larger universities where there are 
people who spend a lot of time on the 
campus. 

When people spend more lime on 
campus, you can assume that they will 
take more interest in the things that go 
on around them There would be more 
people doing the activities that are 
planned for students, and there would 
probably be more opportunities to do a 
diverse number of new aciiviiies. 

More people doing more aciiviiies 
would be good for all of us 

These are jusi some ideas to think 
about for the future of our campus. 
There really are some problems with a 
campus where no one takes pari, and 
we think our suggestions will help 
improve the overall campus morale.

Letters to the 
Editor 



John Glenn 



To Ihe Slaff Editor: 

I cannot disagree with your 
assessment of the news coverage 
regarding John Glenn. 

I can and do disagree with 
vour attitude and disrespect. 
Your reference to Viagra is taste- 
less and juvenile- 
Attaching this event to a 
movie/sports figure is repugnant 
and shows the limits of your abil- 
ity to express your views. 

Seven men aboard this vehicle 
are heroes. They all make a con- 
tribution, including John Glenn. 
Lest we forget that good does not 
come from youth alone. 

It lakes a mixture of ages and 
wisdom to accomplish such a 
feat. NASA will benefit from this 
group's experiences and efforts. 
And so it should be! None of 
those six men would tell you they 
are more heroic than another. 

There are other minds in this 
world besides those of today's 
young adulis. 

' n have a contribution to 



make. Public relations is very 
important as well as experimen- 
tation, extra vehicular activities, 
etc. 

Without public support. 
NASA woula not receive the 
needed support from Congress or 
the average citizen- 
Even tnough John Glenn may 
not be in tune with you, he is and 
has been in tune with a vast 
majority of this nation. 

His contribution was the total 
risk of his life, in an effort that 
has made possible a degree of 
safety today. 

Flights are very risky, not so 
bad as they were in the 
beginning. 

Someone had to take the early 

steps, just as you had to do, 

learning to walk before you run. 

Practice respect, as you would 

have your loved ones respected.

The woman, after a stream of 
complaints, hollered, "'Steward, 
this potato is bad." Rand walked 
over to the woman, picked up die 
potato, then whacked it widi a 
spoon, saying, "Bad potato, bad 
potato, bad potato!" 

From The Daily Vineland: In 
Seattle, a thief attempting to 
siphon gas from a motor home got 
a mouthful of sewage instead. 
"Apparently, the suspect was 
attempting to steal gasoline and got 
the sewage tank instead," said 
Officer Tom Umporowicz. 

The investigating policemen 
found sewage and what looked like 
vomit on the ground near the 
mobile home. Nearby, was a four- 
teen-year-old curled up ill next to a 
car. The owner of the motor home 
declined to press charges, telling 
police. "It's the best laugh I've 
ever had." 

From The San Ramon Valley 
Tmies: A tiuek pulled up in front of 
the Whittier, California, home of 
Martin O'Conner and Slate work- 
ers released thousands of sterile

Being fonneily inieresied in 
pursuing a political career myself, 
1 try to ke«p up widi the goings-on 
in our nation's capital from week 
lo week. 

1 tried to follow the whole 
Lewinsky situation as best as I 
could and am deeply entbialled 
wilb our nation's pending second 
war with Iraij. as well as the search 
for Osama Bin Laden 1 don't 
know where bomber Eric Rudolf^ 
is, but I'm waiting for someone to 
step forth diat does. I love the 
national news. 

The one thing I didn't like dial 
han&gt;ened quite recendy. however, 
was the results of the national elec- 
tion last Tuesday. Granted. I know 
il's a necessary tradition and I fully 
suppon die reason for which it is 
done, but 1 don'i really agree with 
the media blowing the results so 
out of proportion (even though I'm 
a huge fan of recently-elected 
Minnesota governor Jesse "the 
Body" Ventura). 

Many people speculated that 
this election would be one of the 



biggest in the past few years as 
they figured it would decide the 
fate of our president's impeach- 
ment hearing. If the Republicans 
could maintain a majority, die 
piKJdenl would be removed from 
office. If diey suctumbed to the 
Democratic party, the President 
would stay. 

The results were tiius appalling 
to me to see diat for die first time 
in decades ibere isn't a clear 
majority. The Republicans main- 
tain a majority, but diis doesn't 
compensate for those that don't 
follow along party tines 

It would now appear as though 
our Congress is beaded toward a 
deadlock, all because these two 
sides have so liule in common widi 
the way they think And as much as 
1 hate 10 say it, I wish Newi 
Gingrich wouldn't have stepped 
down, as the leadership of the 
Republican party is bound to be 
more aggressive than Gingrich was 
at providing opposition to the 
agenda of die Democratic party. 

I don't know. If it were up to 



From the Mind of a Madman 



As 1 sit here looking at the 
keyboard, attempting to write 
something of a moral and ethical 
value, I cannot help but think, 
"Did 1 remember to feed the fish 
this morning?" 

It is impoEtant to feed the fish 
in ibe morning so that diey get into 
a routine of when Uiey get fed. 

I don't want to go home after a 
long day's work and sec some very 
hungry fish pressing Uieir selfish 
moudis to tbc surface of the water 
looking for their multi-colored 
flakes of nutrition. 

I don't dunk dial I could han- 
dle seeing them starving and 
searching for the nourishment thai 
I neglected to deliver to tiiem. It 
would make me look rather 
ncglxtful of my duties as a care- 
taker for these radier mindless and 
useless creanires Would 1 really 
want that on my conscience? 

I remember one time when 1 
was just a young psychopath of 
around age seven. 1 had about a 
dozen red swoidfisb (or at least 
that's how I referred lo dicm) in a 
20-gallon tank. One night I decid- 
ed to go to a restaurant with my 



family. 

They served some rather 
greasy and sloppy versions of 
hamburgers, assorted types of 
potato producLs, along widi a large 
array of side dishes dial I do not 
wish to remember 1 ordered an 
orange drink widi my meal. 

When we returned home from 
our feast, we were greeted at the 
door by a unique odor. It smelled 
like a nurture of my grandmoth- 
er's baibroom and hair that has 
been burnt. It wasn't pleasing to 
die olfacUiry senses at all. 

We searched for the source of 
die odor. 1 fust went to my fish 
tank 10 see if any of die red sword- 
fish were affected by the stench 
dial bad filled die air. 

Obviously they were affected, 
due to the positions in which diey 
had dieir bellies touching the sur- 
face of the water. They also had 
turned tixvn an almost orange-red 
to an auburn color. 

How had this odor affeaed the 
fisb in such a way as to turn them 
on their backs? Had tiic odor in 
some way contaminated die water, 
or was this a larger plan by Santa

me, the country would take 
President Wa.shingion's advice and 
completely avoid a two-party sys- 
tem. It seems as though every time 
there's an election there's always a 
fight going on between the two 
parties. Considering bow otien this 
is, it makes one wonder bow any- 
thing gets done with these ignoi^t 
self-serving megalomaniacs in 
office 

I suppose 1 lack the patience to 
deal with political issue.^ and 1 cer- 
tainly lack the patience to discuss 
every angle every side can manage 
to come up with. That's probably 
wby I gave up on a political career. 

At any rate, all I can say is I'm 
not very happy with the resulLs of 
the last election. 1 know my expec- 
tations in regards to the progress of 
our government are going to be set 
low in hopes of them actually 
doing something. 

Hopefully, our noble leaders 
will prove me wrong and restore 
my faith in politics again. I doubt 
it, but ru be looking forward to it.

Claus to get back a me for fmding 
out where my {xi:scnts were hid- 
den the Chri.stmas before? Due to 
the inadequate stage I was at m my 
life, I knew that I would never 
know the true answer to this 
catastrophe. 

Later that evening when I went 
to feed the red swordfish, the waia 
in the tank, along with Uie dozen 
swordTish, had disappeared. 

I came to the conclusion that 
this was an inside job and staked 
out the doors of the house. With 
my brother at the back door and 
me at the front, we kept surveil- 
lance and plugged the chimney 

This was some sort of diaboli- 
cal scheme to rid me of my happi- 
ness or of my responsibility to feed 
the fisb. I was hoping that it was 
the latter of the two. 

Maybe this is tbe reason that I 
feel compelled to feed the fish in 
the morning. That way 1 would 
feel no need to wtsry about SMta 
Claus getting revenge or securing 
all of the doors of my house. 

1 guess it is just some way for 
me to deal with the fact that I have 
no control over fish.

by Dcnbe Kopuloa 



Siqff Writer 

Piere's was overflowing v,i[.'i 
people Sunday night for the Biuc-- 
Traveler show, 

The place was jam-packed with 
hundreds of die-bard fans. 

Blues Traveler plays an average 
of 250 shows a year, visiting practi- 
cally every bar and small club in 
almosl all of the 50 siaics, which 
propels their popularity as a "work- 
ing man's" band 

Bluts Traveler was formed in 
1989 in Princeton, New Jersey. 

The hand wis started to revive 
iniercsi in some o( the bands that 
influenced them like die Grateful 
Dead, Led Zeppelin, and the Steve 
Miller Band. 

After being turned down as a 
supporting act for many of the sum- 
mer of 1992's most protnincnt head- 
lining bands, lead singer John 
Popper created the H.O.R.D.E. 
Festival, which has since been a 
huge success. 

The H.OR.DE. Festival was 
the fourth highest grossing concert 
in the summer of 1996. 

Unfortunately, die band wasn't a 
commercial success until 1994 with 
the release of "Four," which yielded 
the two major hits "Run Around" 
and "Hook." The album achieved 
quintuple platinum success. 

Blues Traveler played songs 
from dieir 1990 self-titled debut 
including "Mulling It Over" and 
"But Anyway." which featured a 
pulsing bass solo by Bob Shecban 
Blues Traveler left a blazing trail of 
smoke on stage. 

John Popper is an astounding 
one man show; he composes all the 
band's lyrics and music for many of 
their hit songs. 

With his powerful stage pres- 
ence and breath takingly intricate 
harmonica playing his musical abili- 
ties are nothing short of genius. 

Let's face it, you had to be dead 
not to stomp your feet and shake 
your booty. It was nearly impossible 
to stand SDll. 

The band did an impressive 
cover of "Tbe Joker'' by The Steve 
Miller Band. 

They also bad a little fun by 
adding a short rendition of "The 
Gambler" by Kenny Rogers to their 
scL John Popper switched back and 
fortb between harmonica and 
rhythm guitar on "I Dreamed of You 
Last NighL" 




'iiPJW presekits 'Oleam/ia' 



The IPFW Department of 
Theatre presents David Mamet's 
recent Broadway success 
"Oleanna" in IPFWs Williams 
Theatre on Dec. 4, 5. 11. and 12 at 
8 pjn. 

The ploi is easily recognizable 
to anyone who follows the news 
and current affairs. 

It is a scathing, explosive piece 
dtat deals with issues of sexual 
hirassmeni and misconduct, 
.iiiempied rape, pornography, 
racism, and the current standards 
and modes of conduct of diose 
involved in the American educa- 
tional system. 

TTie play centers around three 
meeungs between Carol, a college 
student, and John, her professor. 

The meetings lake place in 



John's office and they take the 
audience on an emotional roller 
coaster ride that leaves many ques- 
tions unanswered such as did Carol 
set John up, was John being overly 
solicitous to her, and can mere 
accusations ruin lives. 

These are issues that today 
continue to haunt the workplace as 
well as the classroom. 

They affect every interperson- 
al situation in our culture. 

"The topic is timely not only 
for the' academic community but 
for the general public as well," 
Larry Life, the production's direc- 
tor, said. 

"Oleanna" features Brad 
Beauchamp. a community actor 
and director, as John, the professor. 
Sarah Forbing. a senior theater 



major, plays Carol, die student. 

This production marks 
Beaucbamp's First ^pearance on 
the Williams Theatre stage. It is 
Forbing's senior performance 
project 

Tickets are SIO for general 
admission. S9 for IPFW faculty 
and staff, S8 for senior citizens, 
andS5 for IPFW siudcnts. 

They can be purcha.scd at all 
Tickeimasier locations or by call- 
ing the Williams Theatre box 
office al 481-6555 Monday 
through Saturday from 1:30 to 
5:30 p.m. Visa. Mastercard, and 
Discover are all accepted.

Photography exhibit offers informative afternoon 



John Popper of Blues Traveler put on a great show once 
again al Piere's Nov 8. 



He emulated a gunslinger carry- 
ing bullets into a gunfighl; except in 
his leadier, over- the- shoulder sling 
be carries twenty spare harmonicas 
of a dirferent chord to grab as need- 
ed for various songs. 

Guitarist Chan Kinchia wailed 
on "Stand," which lead the guy next 
to me 10 start yelling "Blues 
Traveler rules!" 

Blues Traveler's music and 
lyrics cover a wide range of emo- 
tional topics such as love, pain, 
struggle, and happiness, which arc 
performed widi meaningful and gen- 
uine sincerity. This band oozes tal- 
ent from every pore. 

The band took a brief intermis- 
sion about an hour'and a hglf into die 
.show. 

Meanwhile, music from the 
band Earth. Wind, and Fire wa.s 
pumped through the speakers as the 
audience impatienily awaited the 
band's return to the stage. 

After intermission, it was back 
to business with "100 Years." which 



in my opinion is one of their best 
songs. 

Their blazing encore was a 
cover from The Charlie Daniek 
Band, the all-time great country 
classic "Tlie Devil Went Down To 
Georgia," which was pla&gt;ed with 
graceful speed and instrumental 
agility. 

Blues Traveler is one of die toi 
bands of the 90s, with an amazing. 
ability to bring so many different 
types of people together. 
Through their painstakingly pv,

Have you ever wondered how a camera works? 
Ever pondered what a darkroom looks like? If so, then 
you won't want to miss the Eckrich Education Gallery's 
newest interactive exhibition "In Focus: The Art and 
Science of Photography" Opening December 5, 1998 
and running dirough die year 2001. this hands-on exhib- 
it has something for everyone. 

The word photography comes from the Greek word 
meaning "to write with light" and its basic principles 
can be tracked back nearly 500 years to the Nth and 
15th centuries to the camera obscura. Throughout die 
exhibition are examples and illustrations of how cam- 
eras developed and how photography works. Included 
is a recreation of a darkroom which step-by-siep unrav- 
els the mystery of how film and pictures are developed. 
Visitors can also peek inside a reproduction oiacamera 
obscura. 

Historically, die interest in photography went 
beyond its use for portraiture. Its mass appeal was root- 
ed in the belief that photographs could unconditionally 
document events, people and places. Throughout "In 



Focus: The Art and Science of Photography" are inter- 
active activities that emphasize looking, interpreting, 
and understanding photographs as an art form and how 
photographers diKument and interpret events, while 
communicating ideas through their photographs. In 
anodier section of "In Focus." visitors can experience 
what it was like to have your picture taken in the 1 850's 
and learn how portraits can tell you more about some- 
one than just how they look. 

The exhibition includes works by regional phoiog- 
raphers Karen Thompson, Stephen Perfect, Rob Borel, 
Tom Galliher, and Tun Brumbeloe. "In Focus; The An 
and Science of Photography" is supported by the 
Foellinger Foundation. The Eckrich Education Gallery 
is open during regular museum hours. T\jesday dUDUgh 
Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and on Sunday from noon to 
5 p.m For additional information call the Fort Wayne

Crab Skck brings fast Coast to Fort Waijtie 



by Adam Tiytor 



Features Eduor 

RcccnUy I made a journey with a 
few of my friends from my home in 
Wells Couniy lo the great burg of 
Foft Wayne. anticipaUng an e»cel- 
ten I evening. 

We took ibe drive up Lafayeiie. 
made a few stops and ended up 
going 10 dinner ai a new place ihai 
I'm lold jusi rerenily opened. 

The rc5iflurani, Joe's Crab 
Shack, ended up being much more 
than I bad originally an tin paled. 

Previous lo this night. I had heard 
of this resiaurant and even bad a lil- 
Ue eitpericncc in dealing wiib it. 

I bad overheard loose conversa- 
tion about the place in my biology 
lab and even visited there one oighl 
when my frieod and I stopped by so 
she could pick up a menu (although 
my visit was Uroited lo the parking 
lot). 

I beard talk of picnic tables and 
"stuH" everywhere, nothing of note 
or import, just "stuff." 

I heard the prices were steep, 
[be service was mediocre, and the 
place looked tacky. 

As often happens, however, 
those rumors proved to be as false as 
my ID. 

Upon entering with five minutes 
left until closing, I was shocked to 
discover that we would be able to 
eat there thai nigbt 

It was so late thai the l^co Bell 
back where I Live was closed, so I 
was nearly dumbfounded ai the ser- 
vice my colleagues and I got 



The people who work there 
treated us as ihough we were their 
firei customers in the franchise's 
history, despite the packed tables 

I felt as if 1 was worth more than 
the nei value of the eniirc room writ- 
ten on a check, and it made me feel 
lucky. 

As we look our scan, it wasn't 
long until our waitress, Jessica (an 
IPFW student who was surprisingly 
unfamiliar widi my work at The 
Communicatof), arrived to greet us 
and take our drink orders 

I ordered coffee while the rest of 
my associates purchased alcohol, as 
the law will allow them to do. 

She then took off to get us our 
drinks while we discussed the 
week's events, only to be interrupt- 
ed three minutes later with our 
order. 

Hiding my surprise, I thought to 
myself this girl must really love her 
job because I haven't had such 
quick servicing since I ate at Chili's 
Iwo weeks before this inadenL 

As I sipped on my coffee and 
reflected on how drunk two of my 
buddies were getting, our waitress 
came back and gave my one friend 
some more whiskey and the other 
more beer 

All in all, my whiskey-drinking 
friend drank seven shots from the 
Crab Shack. Jessica and the bar- 
tender bodi exercised Ibe uttermost 
patience in dealing with him. 
despite the fact he had become 
annoyingly bothersome. 

I was undoubtedly impressed in 
the way our waitress handled the 
situation. 



On one of her trips back to Fill 
my cOTnrade's shot gla.ss, Jessica 
took our order- 
It took us all a while to decide 
upon what we wanted lo bless our 
stomachs with that night as every- 
thing on the m.nu sounded anneal- 
ing, but we all managed to decide 
uf)on something. 

Personally, 1 took an appetizer 
item thai put together crab, craw- 
dads and shrimp at a reasonable 
price, bui some of the people 1 was 
with weni a litlJc further and ordered 
more filling items. 

The crab, which I personally got 
a taste of and thought tasted gre^t 
was listed at market price (which 
can be good or bad), and the rest I 
discovered was decently priced as 
well — or at least as reasonably as 
buying seafood in the Midwest can 
get I was impressed, to say the 
least by the sufficient cost of the 
meals available. 

When Jessica finally came about 
with our meals, I wa.*; even more 
impressed. The food tasted as 
though Ihey had just caught it — ^ an 
act that would prove impossible 
considering the biological life found 
in the Three Rivers. 

At any raie, it was all good. The 
clam chowder was equivalent to that 
served in New England; the craw- 
dads tasted like we were eating 
down on the Bayou, and the crab 
made a decent run at those made 
famous in Alaska. 

The only major downfall of the 
evening was Lhat tlKy were out of 
Blue Crab, which reflected how late 
we had arrived at this fine 




restaurant 

It was only because of our tardi- 
ness Uial we weren't given the ben- 
efit of sampling their Blue Crab — 
an experience that is supposedly 
equivalent lo falling in love. 

Even Ihough I was disappoinled 
in not being able to taste the Blue 
Crab, I'd have to say lhat many of 
my preconceptions concerning Joe's 
Crab Shack were quickly dispelled 
as I sat there with my coffee 

The service was quick and grat- 
ifying; the prices were more than 
reflective of the quahty of [he food, 
and the reports of "tackiness" were 
erroneous — the place reminded me 
of every other restaurant I had eaien 
ai (with exception to "Bojangle's") 
on the East Coast and did an excel- 
lent job of conjuring those memo- 
ries for me 

It was as though I were in North 
Carolina once again, enjoying the 
breeze off the Atlantic Ocean. 

In closing. 1 have thiec diings I 
would hke to add. For optimum ser- 
vice, be sure to ask to be seated in 
Jessica's section. Secondly, feel free 
to order anything from the menu. 

As it is all prepared well, it's 
highly unlikely you'll be 
disappoinled. 

Finally, pay litde attention to 
my opinion on this restaurant as 1 
could not begin to describe how 
great Joe's Crab Shack really is. 

It's one of those things you have 
lo experiena* for yourself to fully 
enjoy the quality of the whole diing. 
I know I can't wait to get back there 
myself.

Take- 



Tke wet tms week: Halloween leitovers 
oring joy to nollaay season 



by Vincent Garcia 



Welcome, readers, to another edition of my weekly 
web sites In diis particular particular article, I decided to 
spend limited time searching for web sites. 

This is due to the fact that while 1 was working on 
my Halloween sites, I accidentally came across these 
while searching for sites. 

There is no true (heme 1 focused on — these are just 
some really cool web sites. Most are humorous, but oth- 
ers aren't. Read on... 

h ttp J/vmvtS cU- labsxam^roj ccUtts/ volces-btanl 

This site is a projea of Bell laboratories. Basically, 
you type a message or word into a text box. and then 
synthesize it to the selected voice. It then leiums an 
audio file with the text synd^sized into speech using 
whatever voice you had selected. 

So just bow is this a useful site? Well, it has no real 
use for me. and I supi)ose it wouldn't for most of you, 
either. Yet I can't resist having a gnal voice saying "I'm 
Arnold" or something like ibaL 

The voices include Uiose of a gnat, a '"normal" male 
and female, a coffee drinker, a child, and one called a 
"silly" voice. 1 didn't think it sounded very silly, but I'll 
bet ihose engineers at Bell Laboratories get a kick out of 
it. 

Don't try this web site without a fast computer, 
though. Every time you change the voice or text, you 
have to download the file, which might take a while with 
a slower computer. In the basement of NefT, 1 was easily 
changing suilT and getting the sound back in seconds. It 
was pretty convenienL 

Final note: If you or stHneooe you know is younger 
than 18, don't try and put "potty words" in there. They 
deter this by having a button you must click saying 
you're 18 or over and can listen to these words. I guess 
miiwrs dm'l know how to press buttons. 



fattp ://www,aBnTerliigiDMChliw.co.u k 

By far. Ibis one of the most interesting sites 1 have 
ever seen. Here are interesting messages that have been 
put on answering machines. 

These are free to download and put on your 



answering machine, should you like. One I found lo be 
quite creative was a message played to the tune of 
Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody." The message goes 
something like this (it's hard to hear, so there may be 
errors): 

"Is this a real voice. ..no, this is the answerphorK...in a 
while, we'll be bome.Jcave a message at the tone." 

There arc some other fiinny messages, including one 
made by George in "Seinfeli" and four by "Simpsons" 
characters. 

http://wwwjicptuiMnctcom/antlcan/deraulLhtin 

This site is titled "The Ami -Canada Site." This sile is 
hilarious, to say the least. For those who desire pictures 
in their web sites, don't bother. This one's only funny toi 
those who read. 

There are anti-Canada jokes, and testimonies by peo- 
ple both in the U,S, and Canada. This site was meant to 
be a satire, but as you may have guessed, not all 
Canadians (or Americans) took it that way On one page, 
he has bsied e-mail that has been sent to him. 

Some Canadians insist they live in the best country 
in the world. Others just didn't like the fact that they 
were being cracked on. 

One letter that stood out was. in fact, by an 
American who belongs to an actual anti-Canadian soci- 
ety, and insists that the site is true when it says Canada is 
planning an invasion. 

If you visit this site, visit the jokes page and the top 
ten reasons we shouldn't nuke Canada. ThLs site is defi- 
nitely worth seeing. 

Before I leave, I would like to encourage you all to 
do something. For those of you with lots of creativity, 
make a web site. 

We're all given 10 MB of space to post web pages, 
and if you have a program like FrontPage, you can easi- 
ly make pages, I want to see more IPFW people with 
sites 1 can write about in a future article.

lU searches for vaccine 



by 
Mbhanna Wood 

News Editor 

and 

Andrew Welch 

Saff Writer 



Testing for a vaccine lo ptcveni buman 
papilloma virus (HPV), a sexually transmit- 
icd clisea&lt;&gt;c ibai tia.s been linked to cancer ot 
ibc cervix, began Nov. 5 at the Indiana 
School of Medicine in Indianapolis. 

"If ii is successful, ii will be useful lo 



help find vaccines for other forms of HPV," 

Dr. Dennis Forlenbeny of the lU School of 

Medicine said. 

"No vaccine has been developed but 

there are some that arc promising." said 

Fonen berry. 

Tbe lU Medical Center b jusi ont' of len 

HPV testing site!^ in the nation involved 

with the three-year study conducted by 

infectious disease physicians- 
Volunteers had lo be single women 

between the ages of 16 and 23 with no bis- 

lory of an unhealthy pap smear, 

"One hundred females are currently 

enrolled. Some will get placebo vaccine and 

others will get active vaccine," Denise 



Leggc, a research nurse at the IV School of 
Medicine, infectious disease divisirai, said. 

Eghty-four types of HPV esisi and 
most of tbem go away without 
abnormalilies. 

However, certain varying forms of 
HPV can lead to genital wans, abnormal 
growths above the eye and rare skin 
diseases, 

"If an effeciive vaccine is developed, 
they want to vaccinate girls at age len," 
Leggc said. 

From the 1980s until now, there have 
been several atiempis to develt^ a vaccine 
to control the disease. 

Evidence now poinLs that HPV 16 and 



18 can connected with cancer. 

"It's the single most common sexually 
transmitted disease in the United States. 
"Fonenberry said, "It's the one we know the 
most about." 

HPV 16 is the most prevalent form of 
HPV as.wciaied widi cervical cancer. 

According lo the National Cancer 
Institute, becoming sexually active at an 
early age and having many partners highly 
increases the chartce of getting cancer. 

Smoking, decreased resistance to infec- 
tions and other ailments along with HPV 
can also have an e^eci on tbc probability of 
cancer developing. 

According lo Sara Smith, research 



nurse at lU School of Medicine, only a 
small percentage of women would develop 
cancer if the HPV positive cells were not 
removed from the surface of Ibc cervix. 

"The problem is we don't know how lo 
identify those who will and will not have 
cancer." Fonenberry said. 

According lo Forxenberry. if a vaccine 
were found it would take several years 
before it could reach the market. 

The vaccine must be demonstrated as 
successful. It has to be marketed and people 
have to accept giving it to young children.

Hut, Hut Hike: Broncos still undefeated 



by MaK Sthti 



Staff Writer 

Ii figures, after laying out my 
whole ptan about why the BCS is 
wrong, the regular season will even- 
tually weed out all but two of (he 
undcfcaicds and ttie systems will 
appear to work perfectly. 

Ohio State got the ball rolling 
by pulling their annual chokejob 
against a leain from Michigan. 

This time ii was the Spanans 
who rallied from a 24-9 dcficil lo 
upset the &lt;f 1 Buckeyes in Columbus. 

Now thai a championship is oul 
of reach, the Buckeyes will proba- 
bly beat the Wolverines. 

Kansas State and Tennessee 
now share the #1 spot, so ihcy will 
meet in ihc Ficsla Bowl, right? 
Well. K-Slaie still has Nebraska, 
and possibly Texas A&amp;M in the Big 
12 Cliampionship game. 

Tennessee plays Arkansas 
(whommorc 1 failed to mention as 
unbeaten last week) which will 
eliminate another team from lille 
conienljon. 

Wisconsin plays Michigan, who 
looked strong after dismantling 
Penn Stale 27-0. and could win the 
Big Ten wilh victories over the 
Badgers and Buckeyes. 

Wilh UCLA, you figure their 
luck has to run oul sooner or later. 
They have just escaped Stanford 
and Oregon Suie the last iwo 
weeks, and close ihe season out 
against the likes of Washington, 
use, ^d Miami (Tla.) in a makeup 
game due to a hurricane. 

Sorry Tulanc. but you don't gel 
consideration until you play a real 
schedule. 

Realistically, instead of four or 
Iwo undefeated teams liere may be 
none or only one. 

Personaily, I am hoping for a 
situation that produces controversy 
and chaos so that this system can be 
eradicated. 

NFL 

.: I constantly prop the college 
I game and dog the pro's, and right- 
fully so. 

College spons are more excit- 



ing, energetic, enihusiasiic. eleciric. 

etc,.,. 

But I have to admit that this is 
the most interesting NFL regular 
season in recent memory. 

I've stated before that free- 
agency, especially among the suc- 
cessful teams is deirimenial. 
because the organizations cannot 



7-2 and host San Francisco with 
first place on the line in Ihe NFC 
West this Sunday. 

The Dallas Cowboys have 
weathered the siorm while Troy 
Aikman recuperated from a broken 
clavicle and are in sole possession 
of firs; in ihe NFC East 

The New England PamoLs and 




afford to pay each player as much as 
other teams offer. 

The result is that the talent base 
is less concentrated among the 
upper echelon te^ns, now more so 
than ever before. 

Some call it parity, others call ii 
mediocrity. Whatever ihe case, there 
are fewer gimme's on the schedule, 
unless you play Chicago and Indy. 

How does Green Bay handle the 
49ers and get blown oui in the first 
half by a Pittsburgh team that tosi to 
Tennessee the previous week? 

Tennessee then beats Tampa 
Bay who defeated ibe unbeaten 
Vikings the week before. 

The only guaraniee ls that 1 
don't come in first in the pool each 
week. 

There have been a number of 
interesting sub-plots in the NFL this 
season. 

Dermis Green bad his quarter- 
back dilenmia resolved for him 
when starter Randall Cunningh^n 
and Btad Johnson both were injured 
Sunday in a win over New Orleans. 

The Atlanta Falcons quielly are 



Kansas City Chiefs have been a 
major disappointment, and will 
struggle 10 make ihe 

playoffs.. An zona fans are ecstadc 
to be over .500 this late into Ihe sea- 
son for the first time in the 90s 
unbeaten deficit of Washington con- 
troversy. 



AROUND THE NFL 

The year of Ihe veteran QB con- 
tinues with Doug FlulJe. Vinny 
Testaverde, Chris Chandler, and 
Cunningham all having their careers 
resurrected. 

Meanwhile, rookies Mannmg, 
Leaf, and Batch have six wins 
between them, 

A plethora of college QB's will 
be available in this spring's draft, 
including Duanie Culpepper, 
Donovan McNabb, Joe Gerrnaine, 
and possibly Tim Couch, and Cade 
McNown. 

My advice to the GMs who 
draft these future stars, sign a veter- 
an QB to leach these guys the iniri- 



cacies and nuances of Ibe game. 
before ihey are expected lo start 

winning games. 

Did I mention that the Denver 
Broncos are having a pretty good 
year? 

At 9-0 a perfect season is an 
attainable goal. No doubt they are 
good enough, but the pressure will 
continue to mount each week, as 
they attempt to equal the mark of 
the 1972 Miami Dolphins. 

Whether or noi Ihc players will 
admit it, chasing history has lo be a 
distraction. 

If recent history is any indica- 
tion, the Broncos jusi might do il. 

The 1996 Chicago Bulls and 
this season's New York Yankees 
broke records for wins, and went on 
to win the championship. 

The defending champion 
Broncos share three similarities, in 
addition to great players, with ihe 
Yankees and Bulls, 

1} Professionalism: theathleies 
on these teams actually do take one 
game ai a time lo use a bred bul 
accurate sporus cliche. 

2) Veteran leadership: David 
Cone &amp; Beraie Williams, Michael 
&amp; Scoitie. John Elway and Terrell 
Davis. All these players have big 
game experience and know what il 
lakes 10 win, even when they're nol 
at their best. 

3) Coaching: Phil Jackson. Joe 
Torre, and Mike Sbanahan are 
among the best in iheir respective 
sport. 

WHAT BOTHERS YOU 
ABOUT SPORTS? 

The NBA lockout^ Not really. 

Aihleies regularly gelling in 
trouble with the law? No, 1 actually 
expect that to happen. 

The BCS? No way. it is a per- 
fect system. 

What bothers me are the liiile 
things like commentators who bela- 
bor the obvious and fat, drunk, shin- 
less, fans who paini their bodies 
before going to NFL games. 

College basketball preseason 
and All-American teams: How 
pointless is it to be ranked the best 
team or player, before the season 



sians? 

Finally, the ba.seball awards; 
each day for Ihe next two weeks, a 
differeni baseball award is handed 
out. Monday, Keny Wood. National 
League rookie of the year. Tuesday, 
Ben Grieve, American Ixague rook- 
ie of the year AL Cy Young, NL Cy 
Young. AL MVP, NL MVP blah- 
blahblahblahblah. 

Why not have one of those 
ridiculous award shows, like the 
ESPY's where everyone gets in 
Uieir luxes and shori dresses and 
celebrities announce the awards in a 
nice, neai, hour-long show?

I'm not totally negative. 

Two things 1 do like about 
spons; Kaiahna Will, and the new 
Nike commercials promoting an 
end to the NBA labor siiuation. 

One commercial has Samuel L, 
Jackson saying. 'Three white guys 
playing horse, fantasbc!!!" 

Anoiher has Spike Lee taunting 
a girl named Regina Miller in a mid- 
dle school girls basketball game. 

All are followed by the state- 
ment, "Hurry up, Stan the season," 

My feeling is that a deal will be 
done in limc for games to be played 
by Chrisimas, 



Want $25/)00+ 
for college? 

The Army Reserve can help you take a big bite out of 
college expenses.

IPFW hosting Great Lakes Valley Conference tournament today 



spans Editor 

The Dons are whai some mighi caJI "En 
Fuego," or caiching fire, especially of taie, 
compiling a 26-6 overall record, 14-2 in the 
GLVC 

IPFWs womens volleyball leam 
wrapped up ihc conference litlc nnlshing 



ibc season winning 16 of the icam's lasi 17 
games. 

The Dons have noi only impressed ihe 
GLVC bul have also made quilc an impres- 
sion on (he Midwest region, with iheir 
founh-place ranlung. 

With a'l of ihe icam's presUge, ii was 
awarded ihe honor of bosiing ihe confer- 
ence toumamenu 

II will be a three-day loumament with 



games starting today at noon and conclud- 
ing ai 2 p.m, Saiurday, Nov, 14, 

The Dons started ihe season oui slug- 
gishly as many teams often do. 

However, they played top-notch compe- 
liiion in the Regis touniameni at Denver. 

ThLs paved the way for the team to see 
what they needed to do to compete at that 
higher level. 

It wasn't until then that the team real- 



^^^ 



5 MM^ /r/S 




ly came together and formed one of the 
strongest teams IPFW womens volleyball 
has ever seen. 

Outside hitters Laura Douglas and Katie 
Bruening have pbyed as tough as anyone in 
the conference 

Plus, the move that sent senior Star 
Trahin to play middle with junior Rachel 
Brown has b(%n nothing but successful for 
the Dons. 

Sophomore setter Tami Iseh has been the 
Dons' guiding light. Leading the team. 
GLVC, and NCAA in assists she is a key 
both offensively and defensively. 

Complementing the play of Isch is one 
of the biggest surprises of the team, Denna 
Brown, 

Early on, Brown did not necessarily 
know her role, but has developed into as 
one of the best on the team. Playing with a 
great balance of tenacity and heart, she does 
what it lakes to spark a rally. 

The sensational six have done a great 
job for the Dons, even the defensive spe- 
cialists have played well, 

Jodi Schnelker and Stephanie Frecl 
have been improving dietr dig percentage 



Did You Know? 

The womens 

volleyball team 

has won 45 

consecutive home 

matches, a streak 

that dates all the 

way back to 

Oct. 15, 1995. 



and have provided serves that would give 
any opponent trouble. 

The Dons certainly have a lot going for 
them and will be very tough to beat in the 
tournament. Especially with the tournament 
on their home court here at the Gates Sports 
Center.
