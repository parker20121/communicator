NEWS BRIEFS 

JERRY BROWN TO SPEAK 
AT EXPOSITION CENTER 

Jerry Brown rolled into Fort Wayne at about 5 p.m. 
last Tuesday, and he's headed for the fourth congres- 
sional district annual dinner to be held in the exposi- 
tion center at the Coliseum, on Friday, May 1, at 6:30 
p.m. 

"I think part of his goal is to pull the people back 
into the campaign process. It's about giving the 
power back to the people," said Karen Moriarty who 
works for the Jerry Brown for President campaign. 

People interested in going to the dinner can call 
482-2714 for information. The dinner is open to the 
public, but the cost is $40.00 per plate. 

PIAZZA INTERVIEWS FOR USI POSITION 
BUT SAYS NOTHING IS DEFINITE YET 

IPFW men's basketball coach, Andy Piazza, has 
interviewed for the coaching spot at the University of 
Southern Indiana. 

Piazza said USI flew him to Evansville for the inter- 
view last week. "I was down there for a couple of 
days," he said. 

But Piazza said things are still up in the air on a 
move south. "I haven't made any decisions. It's not a 
panic situation. I have no idea if I would take the job 
even if they decided they wanted me." 

Piazza said he does like ISU's program. "I have a 
lot of respect for USI's atheletic director, Don 
Bennett. USI has had the reputation of making a 
committment to their athletic department and provid- 
ing the resources to make their program successful." 

At IPFW this season, Piazza led his Mastodons to a 
21-7 record— best ever for this school. Piazza has 
held the head coaching job here for five years. Piazza 
had a winning season each year at IPFW. 

"1 feel very flattered that they called me. I think it's 
a compliment to oar basketball program," Piazza 
said. 

PETITION COMMITTEE GETS 
400 SIGNATURES FOR PEROT 

The response was greater than they ever expected, 
according to Jerry Hendrix, co-county coordinator 
for the Ross Perot petition committee. 

"It's overwhelming. The response has been about 
four times what we expected. We're going to get 
about 400 signatures," said Hendrix. 

Tuesday's signature drive was organized by 
Malcolm Bender, a student at IPFW. 

"The response has not been from a select group. All 
people, across all social and economic lines are just 
plain mad," concluded Hedrix. 

The petition committee seeks additional volunteers 
to help with the drive. Interested individuals should 
call the petition office at 744-0061. 

EDUCATION WRITER TO SPEAK 
AT IPFW EDUCATION CONFERENCE 

Nancy Polette, writer of more than a dozen books 
on using literature in education, will speak on 
"Stretching Minds with Books" at the annual IPFW 
Education Conference, Wednesday, May 6, at 7:30

Polette, associate professor of education at 
Lindenwood Colleges, St. Charles, Mo., said, "As 
director of the laboratory school at Lindenwood 
which features programs for gifted children, I have 
had a working laboratory in which to integrate litera- 
ture into gifted programs and to observe the magic 
which happens with such integration." 

Her books include The Vodka in the Punch and 
Other Notes from a Library Supervisor, Reading 
Guidance in a Media Age, E is for Everybody: A 
Manual for Bringing Fine Picture Books into the

IPSGA allocates $300,000 budget for next year 



By Chad Hesting 
Managing Editor 

Dan Reese, vice president of 
finance for IPSGA, submitted 
the 1992-93 student fee budget 
proposals, at the April 23 
meeting. 

The student services fees, paid 
by all IPFW students, fund ihe 
student fee budget. Reese and a 
four-student budgeting commit- 
tee drew up the proposals for 
allocations. The proposals were 
based on recommendations sub- 
mitted by student agencies and 
student groups. 

The student senate, according 
to official procedure, will debate 



the proposals and adjust iliem as 
it sees fit. Kristina Frazier- 
Henry, student body president, 
then reviews the proposals and 
declares her approval or disap- 
proval. The budget is then sub- 
mitted to the office of the dean 
of students, where additional 
adjustments may be made. 

Among the student agencies 
and groups, receiving funds arc: 
student senate, student activities 
board, forensics league, the divi- 
sion of music, the department of 
fine arts, the child care consor- 
tium, the Ulmcr Emergency 
Loan Program, PIT. The 
Communicator, and other recog- 



nized campus organizations. 
The total student fee budget for 
1992-93 is S293.480. Reese rec- 
ommended no organization, 
with the exception of PIT. 
receive less funding than it did 
intlic 1991-92 budget. 



"So few people come to 
(SAB) events, that the 
money would be wasted." 
-Robert Murray 

PIT asked for less money than 
it received last year, according 
to Reese. The budget proposal 
decreased PIT's funding by 2,03

Interviews tricky, but survivable 



By Mike Wade 
News Editor 

If you are having lunch with a 
prospective employer, and the 
interviewer offers you a drink, 
turn it down. 

No matter what is said about 
martini lunches, alcohol makes u 
bad impression on many inter- 
viewers, according to Linda 
Scott, assistant director of 
Career Services. 

"You never know; maybe the 
interviewer doesn't care. Maybe 
it's a test," said Scott. 

Everyone has heard stories 
about outrageous interviewers, 
but there arc some questions 
every applicant should be pre* 
pared to answer, according to 
Scott. 

Most interviewers will ask you 
to tell diem about yourself. 

"Don't tell them: where you 
were born, where you went to 
high school, that you are a 
divorced mother trying to cope 
with a changing world," said 
Scott. 

Applicants should talk about 
characteristics of their personali- 
ties. They should use events as 
examples to back up their state- 
ments, said ScolL "For example. 
tell the interviewer you have 
good writing skills. Then back it 
up by saying you wrote for your 
high school yearbook, you cur- 
rently write for your school 
newspaper, you've submitted 
several articles Tor publication in 
your business newsletter, 
etcetera," said Scott. 

Most interviewers will also ask 
for questions from the applicant. 

Scott advises students to be 
prepared to ask questions. She 
urges students to refrain from 
saying they have no questions. 
"Job seekers should ask ques- 
tions that show they have 
researched the company. The 
applicant may ask die interview- 



er to elaborate on something 
discovered through research of 
die company." said ScolL 

The applicant should ask the 
interviewer what the follow-up 
procedures are and when they 
will contact you. according to 
Scott. 

She said, "If you don't hear 
from the company within the 
arranged time period, call Hie 
company, tell them that you arc 
still interested, and ask them if 
there is anything else you could 
provide to them. 

"You may have provided 
everything possible; still ask," 
said Scott. 

The applicant should send a 
thank you letter to the interview- 
er after the interview, according 
to Scott. 

Salaries are not appropriate 
topics for discussion during an 
interview. 

The office of Career Services 
can call a company and find out 
the range of starling salaries for 
the student. 

Or, the student may call the 
personnel office of the company, 
and find out the range that way. 

Applicants who have to travel 
to an interview may need to 



know the uavel reimbursement 
policy of a company. 

Scott said students should 
always use the term "policy" or 
"procedure" in requesting such 
information. 

The companies will usually 
pay for the uavel expenses of a 
candidate, according to Scott. 

Some candidates may en- 
counter an interviewer who asks 
an illegal question. 

According to the Civil Rights 
Act or 1964, it is unlawful for 
an employer to discriminate on 
the basis of race, color, religion, 
sex, age, marital status, or 
national origin. 

According to Scott, an appro- 
priate response to a question die 
candidate believes to be illegal 
would be: "I'll be happy to 
answer if you can show me die 
relevance." 

"Giving the interviewer a 
chance to rephrase the question 
and show relevance demon- 
strates poise and knowledge on 
the job applicant's part," said 
Scull. 

Scott said that if the interview- 
er continues to ask illegal ques- 
tions, die applicant has the right 
to walk out of the interview. 



percent. 

Marian Adair, dean of stu- 
dents, said, "These recommen- 
dations arc good. There is prob- 
ably not much we would wish to 
change in this budget." 

The student senate voted to 
alter one item. The newly creat- 
ed SAB summer programming 
budget of S15.000 was cut to 
S8,000. The other S7.000 will 
remain in the student senate's 
discretionary fund, to be doled 
out to student groups or SAB as 
the senate sees fit. 

Senators' objections to the 
summer programming budget 
centered around the poor atten- 



dance at SAB events. "So few 
people come to those events, 
that the money would be wast- 
ed," said Robcn Murray, student 
senator. 

Because of time eonsuaints, 
the senate tabled the budget for 
discussion until the May I 
meeting. 

The meeting will be held in 
Walb Memorial Union, Room 
1 16. The senate will discuss 
funding for: PIT, The Com- 
municator, the fine arts depart- 
ment, the psychology club, 
and some other organizations. 



Increased police staff 
allows for boost in 
violator towing 



By Janet Ausbury 
Staff Writer 

An increase in Police and 
Safety staff has led to increased 
towing of cars whose owners 
have at least four unpaid tickets, 
SgL Tom Haner explained that 
the four-ticket limit is in the 
parking regulations and has been 
enforced in the past. However, 
more cars arc now being towed, 
not because there arc more 
offenses, but because there are 
more Police and Safety person- 
nel to keep up with the 
offenders. 

Haner said that the vehicle 
owner is notified twice for each 
ticket and given 10 days to pay. 
If payment is not received, a S5 
encumbrance fee is added to the 
ticket. Anyone whose vehicle is 
towed must pay the towing fee 
directly to the lowing company 
to get the vehicle back. 

The vehicle owner must then 
pay all outstanding tickets and 
encumbrance fees to Police and 
Safety. If the vehicle owner 
parks the vehicle on campus 
without having paid the out- 
standing tickets, die car will be 
lowed again. Haner said that 
repeat offenders could be subject 
to disciplinary action by the 
dean of students, but not by 
Police and Safety. 
Police and Safety fills out a 
tow report prior to having vehi- 
cles towed. This form lists all 
marks and damage found on the 
car prior to towing. Haner 
explained that this record keeps 
Police and Safety from being 
liable for any damage done to 
die vehicle by towing, 

"If there is any damage done 
while towing, this should be 
taken up with the towing compa- 
ny," he added. 

Haner could not recall any case 
in which a vehicle has been 
towed more than once. He noted 
that although students, faculty, 



staff, and visitors can all be sub- 
ject to tickets if they violate the 
parking regulations, only stu- 
dents have had to be towed so 
far. 

Police and Safety is willing to 
work with students who have 
financial troubles in paying tick- 
ets, as long as those students 
contact Police and Safety to 
explain their problem. 

"We understand that some stu- 
dents are on a restricted budget," 
said Haner. 

If a student needs to wait sev- 
eral days for a check to come in 
before paying fines. Police and 
Safety will suspend lowing of 
the vehicle until the day when 
the student is to receive pay- 
ment. If the student docs not 
make payment that day, the 
vehicle may then be towed. 

In other Police and Safety 
news, Haner said the department 
is investigating several incidents 
of computer tampering which 
occurred earlier this month, 

Haner said the suspect appar- 
ently entered faculty offices in 
Neff 240B, 260, and 340. 
destroying or altering software 
commands and preventing the 
computer users from being able 
to access their programs. 

Police and Safety suspects that 
the tampering was done by phys- 
ically accessing the computers, 
not by getting in through the

Haner added that computer 
tampering is a criminal offense 
and anyone caught tampering 
with IPFW computers will be 
arrested. 




Job market still tough

Although Linda Scott, assis- 
tant director of Career 
Services, says she can't speak 
about die job market in gener- 
al, she is more than happy to 
elaborate on the changes IPFW 
is seeing. 

"We've had a slow year as far 
as the number of companies 
coming to interview on cam- 
pus," said Scott. 

In the spring of 1991. 49 
companies came to IPFW to 
interview. In the spring of 
1992, 36 companies came. 

"However. I'm now starting 
to see a slight increase in the 
number of companies calling to 
ask for resume referrals," con- 
tinued Scott. 

As far as what majors arc in 
demand, Scott said. "In terms 
of campus interviewing, we've 
had a wide range with most 
companies. Many want 
Bachelor degree candidates in 
any field." 

If any fields arc panicularly 
hot, Scott said they were the 



health care profession, environ- 
mental engineering, and 
accounting, although account- 
ing isn't as strong as it has 
been in the past. 

However, Scott said she 
planned to contact United 
Technologies Automotive, in 
an attempt to get the company 
to use IPFW's services. 

The company will be relocat- 
ing to Fort Wayne and will 
have about 150 new positions 
to fill, according to ScotL 

Scott said the new location 
might provide jobs to IPFW's 
engineering graduates, since it 
was her understanding the 
company planned to set up an 
engineering center. 

Many graduates expect to get 
a higher starting salary man is 
realistic, and many expect to 
start at a higher level than is 
realistic, according to Scott. 

"The biggest problem is that 
the expectation of the student 
doesn't always match the 
expectation of the employer," 
said Scou.

Death penalty serves 
no beneficial purpose 



State governments can inflict no greater 
punishment on their murderers than to 
execute them. After forty years of sharp 
decline in executions, the numbers arc 
rising again after the Supreme Court 
restored slates' right to execute in the 
Gregg v. Georgia decision in 1976. 

Support for capital punishment is high. 
Currently, more than 2,000 prisoners sit 
on death row in state prisons. Americans 
are more comfortable with the notion of 
putting these felons to death than com- 
mitting their lives to imprisonment. 

"I'd rather execute them than see them 
live off my tax money, watching TV the 
rest of their lives." goes the most familiar 
argument. That statement, lhat a life 
imprisonment sentence is more expensive 
ihan a death sentence, is wrong. It has 
not factual basis, from an economic 
standpoint. 

In a 1986 University of California-Davis 
Law Review article, Margot Garey esti- 
mated the cost to complete a California 
capital trial at $500,000 — minimum. The 
same article went on to say that between 
August of 1977 and December of 1985, 
only 190 of 1,847 cases actually resulted 
in a death sentence, a success rate of 
roughly one in ten. 

At the S500.0U0 estimated cost, lhat 
means California spends $5 million to 
execuie one murderer. Those costs are noL 
unique 10 California, either. In Kansas in 
1987, the legislature declined 10 reintro- 
duce executions when the cost was esti- 
mated to be $50 million — before the first 
one could be carried out. The Ohio Public 
Defender's Office cites a cost of $2 mil- 
lion per death sentence. 

Compare these with the cost of a life 
imprisonment sentence. The nalional 
average annual cost of housing a lifer is 



around $20,000, according lo the 
Department of Justice. If a prisoner 
spends fifty years in the stir, that adds up 
to $1 million dollars. 

Thus, the death penalty makes no fiscal 
sense. 

The argument lhat ihe death penalty acts 
as a deterrent also holds no water. 
Murders and excculions have continued 
for ceniuries with no slopping. In past 
times, more barbaric forms of execution 
were thought to deter murderers, but they 
didn't. In recent years, methods of execu- 
tion in use are thought to be more 
"humane" (such as electric chairs, gas 
chambers, and lethal injections), but ihey 
warn no one away from crime. Since the 
execution of Gary Gilmorc in 1977, the 
American murder rate has not gone down. 

Capital punishment is morally wrong, as 
well. Moral people know that killing is 
the language of the criminal, yet collec- 
tively we kill as we never would as indi- 
viduals. Under the aegis of ihe state it 
becomes "justice," blood lust in a judicial 
robe. 

Still we are afraid to look capital pun- 
ishment in its face, to expose ourselves to 
the carnality of it. Why are executions not 
televised, if they are to be a deterrent? 
Why no more public executions in 
America? Why is it that one of ihe two 
executioners throws a dummy switch for 
the electric chair? Why is it that one of a 
five-man firing squad is given a blank to 
shoot? 

As individuals, we cannot face up to the 
responsibility of killing. 

The law finds its justification in the ben- 
efit it provides to society. No real good 
has been done with the restoration of the 
death penalty in America. It deserves to 
be abolished. 



Counterpoint 

Penalty serves justice 



By Gene Conn 
IPFW Student 

Metaphorically speaking, since Cain 
slew Able, man has tried to determine 
what is the just punishment for the mur- 
derers in our midst. What we are talking 
about is justice. The argument over capi- 
tal punishment takes many forms, but 
they all center around what is just. Is the 
state justified in killing a killer? 

John Locke wrote, "Man ... hath by 
nature a power not only to preserve his 
property — this is his life, but to judge of 
and punish the breaches of lhat law in 
others, as he is persuaded the offense 
deserves ... ," 

Punishment is by definition cruel; it 
must be if it is to serve its purposes: lo 
deter crime and ensure justice. If it is 
posited that capital punishment denies the 
right to life, it is ihe same as saying lhat 
fines deny property rights or imprison- 
ment denies freedom. 

What should we make of the claim by 
opponents of capital punishment that 
minorities and the poor cannot expect 
equal rights under the law? In June 1972 
the U.S. Supreme Court declared ihe 
death penalty unconstitutional, citing a 
"lack of standards" in the method of 
selecting who would pay the ultimate 
price for crime. Yet, if discriminatry 
impact means a punishment is cruel and 
unusual then so arc most other forms of 
punishment for crimes of violence. 

As for the poor's claim of bias, I would 
counter, that the affluent of our society 
aren't prone lo murdering motel clerks. I 
submit that the U.S. Surprcme Court's 
stricter standards and guidelines have had 
an affect in reducing bias in the applica- 
tion of capital punishment. This affect 
has been brought about by the impartiali- 
ty of the jury trial process. Capital pun- 
ishment, then, is applied to those cases 



where the community determines that this 
punishment is appropriate, in accordance 
with the facts of each individual case. 

In response to opposition to former 
methods of execution, lethal injection 
was devised. Lethal injection demon- 
strates the community's concern with tak- 
ing the moral high ground. We show 
compassion to the killer who shed the 
blood of the innocent. 

Lethal injection takes the spectacle out 
of execution. It allows the state to carry 
out its duty — to protect its citizens and 
punish the guilty — while demonstrating 
mercy in its manner of carrying out that 
punishment. 

Opponents of capital punishment claim 
that no method of execution is humane. 1 
ask instead that you imagine the agony of 
his victim. 

Abolilionisis always claim that the falli- 
bility of our judicial system necessitates 
lhat an innocent man will die at the hands 
of the state. This is not even the point. 

First of all, execution must only take 
place in cases where there is absolutely 
no doubt as to guilt and aggravating cir- 
custanccs. Secondly, the jury trial and 
appeals process in America is the best in 
the world. It bends over backwards, as it 
should, in the protection and presumed 
innocence of the accused. Finally, when 
guilt is no longer in question, then justice 
must move swiftly to punish. 

The death penalty, as it stands right now, 
is more a risk than a reality. If it is ever to 
be a deterrent, then it has to be the 
unavoidable price for the taking of a 
human life. 

We must admit to the utility to this sen- 
tence in meting out justice to the murder- 
ers in our midst while continuing to make 
the reforms necessary to ensure justice 
for all.

Message to V.P.: mind your job next year 

To the Editor: elections. Had this information didalc is actually going to bother to paying attention to important item; 

In the April 9 issue of The oboul Rashecd's attendance come do his job. instead of gossipy fillers. After all 



To the Editor 

In Ihe Apr 
Communici 
impeachment of senators said that 
Sccmab R as heed, the newly elected 
vice president of finance, had five 
absences from meetings. Am I the 
only one upsci enough about this to 
write in? If Mr, Rasheed refused to 
attend meetings and perform his 
duties as a senator, how can students 
trust him as a vice president of 
finance to oversee our student ser- 
vice fees? 

Of course, I am partly to blame. I 
did not vote in student government 



. Had this informal 
about Rashecd's attendance c 

er, I certainly would have 
voted to keep him out of office. 
Why did The Communicator pub- 
lish this information after the elec- 
tions and not before, when the stu- 
dents really needed to know and 
could have made a be tier -informed 
voting decision? Face it, 
Communicator, you are not doing 
your job. Instead of giving us pid- 
dlcy little articles about which sena- 
tors are squabbling these days, you 
should be checking into things that 
matter, like whether an election can- 



didalc is actually going 


o bother to 


do his job. 




Secmab Rasheed, be 


aware thai 


some of us out here ar 


concerned 


about how you will handle our stu- 


dent service fees. We w 


1 be watch- 


ing you to make sure you do your 


If you take the san 


e altitude 


toward your new positio 


t as you did 


when you were a senato 


, well, then 


I'm sure there ore ways 


o recall you 


out of office (if you 


don't gel 


impeached first). 




And lo The Commu 


tcatot, we 


will watch you too lo se 


e if you are 



paying attention to important items 
instead of gossipy fillers. After all, 

ir student service fees pay for your 
paper. If you are nol telling us what 
we need to know, why should you 
exist? 

Lastly, to those who arc in chaigc 
of sludeni government elections: 
icsl assured, you will have at least a 
few more voters for next year's 
election. With student service fees 
going up, students can'i afford to be 
apathetic anymore.

Snyder's letters, IPSGA stint were rotten 



To the Editor: 

Please allow me to take up a few 
inches of space in your paper so I 
may respond lo Mark Snyder's let- 
ter from last week. 

Mark, the reason why some stu- 
dents seem lo be so "benign" and 
"disinterested" is because we arc 
busy doing what you ought lo be 
doing: gelling our degrees. 

We no longer have time to jump at 
every crisis manufactured by "the 
student who cried wolf as you arc 
becoming known. Let me explain 
why you no longer have any credi- 
bility with the students in general. 

Who arc you u&gt; accuse the student 
government, of which you were 
once a pari, of "fornicating"? (what 
a lovely fundamentalist word) Whai 
about your harem of homely admir- 
ers, some of who were in students' 
government with you? (Word does 
get around campus.) I suppose thai 
if I had a group of so-called femi- 
nists worshiping at my uliar and 
doing my bidding, I would be ego- 
tistical loo (although I sure wouldn't 
C" them — con you moke die same 
claim7) 

Gee, for one who hales any 
iiiicmpi to pass judgment on your 
behavior, you ore quick to do the 

So ihe student government was 
bogged down in impeachment, huh? 
Let's see, what did you accomplish 
before impeachment got underway 
last fall? Well, last summer some 
new picnic tables were supposed to 



ted. This 



befoi 



impeachment, so don't blame the 
holdup on stud cm government. 

The picnic tables don't look any 
different lo us. Are the paint cans 
still silting around somewhere on 
Ihis campus, creating a fire hazard 
and a waste of students' money? 
Yes, this was your brainchild. 
(Word docs get around campus). 

Then there was the great asbestos 
fiasco, also your pre- impeachment 
brainchild. After a few weeks of 
needlessly scaring students about 
their possible exposure to asbestos 
on campus, lests proved that campus 
asbestos levels arc far below what is 
considered the threshold of danger. 

And despite your attempts to be 

"You had one of your minions 
pull asbestos from the ceiling of 
the library lounge. Smart move!" 
-Matthew Jones 

the great savior of students, you had 
one of your minions pull asbestos 
from the ceiling of ihe library 
lounge, possibly letting loose even 
more asbestos into the air. Smart 
move! (Word does gel around 
campus.) 

And for as much as you compl fees wasted on something thai 1 
can buy anywhere. And when did 
you become such a fighter of AIDS? 

Why, I remember a leiter lo The 
Communicator from about two 
years ago in which you denounced 
the AIDS scare as exactly that— a 
scare designed by the U.S. govern- 
ment lo control our morality. 
(Communicator editors, feel free to 
research this. I think it was spring 
semester of 1990.) What changed 
your mind? Political correctness? Or 
maybe it was all lhat "fomicaling." 

So our students arc apathetic, and 
the student government is guilty of 
discrimination. What about last 
summer when four students attempt- 
ed to become involved by joining 
senate, and only one was voted on. 

The others were rejected for a 
variety of pathetic excuses made by 
the people who voted against them. 
Elitist? Cliquc-y? Discriminatory? 
You bet — and you were one of the 
people who argued and voted lo pre- 
vent the other three students from 
participating. (Word docs gel 10 

When you get right down to ii, 

Mark, you arc apathetic where you 

should be the most interested. Your

THE COMMUNICATOR 



Frazier-Henry spends two cents 



To the Edilor: 

As I leave the hallowed halls of 
IPFW. I take this mom em to 

reflect upon my experiences at this 
university. 

Let's begin with the quality of teach- 
ing, shall we? If you're looking for an 
instructor who is fair, knowledgeable, 
and encourages independent thought, 
I recommend the following: Jeanne 
Baronc (Communication), Bill 
Frederick (Computer Science), Steve 
Hollander (English), Glenn Emley 
(History), Jim Ator (Music), Sarah 
Beckman (Nursing), Mike Miller. 
Carrie Van Daele, Karen Wakcly, 
Sieve Sims (OLS), Bill Brucning, 
Sheila Brucning, David Fairchild 
(Philosophy), Elliott Bartky, Michael 
Down's (Political Science), Josh 
Gcrow (Psychology), and Pat Ashion 
(Sociology). 

Moving right along, let's talk about 
the administrators and staff persons at 
IPFW. They're not as bad as Mr. 
Snyder has led you to believe. I would 
like to thank the following for all of 
their assistance in my seven glorious 
years at IPFW: Phil Grote, Dave 
Lecka, Phil Davich (Comptroller), 
ul Strouts (Campus Police and 
Purchasing). Ken Ballhaser (LRC), 
Karen Ruhl (Print Services), Jack 
Dahl, Norm Grcenberg (Registrar), 
and Don Katler (Physical Plant). 

And what would a letter to the editor 
be without some son of reference to 



Student Government? It's loo bad you 
only read about the negative aspects 
of IPSGA. Maybe next year it will be 
differcnt...Nah! So why break tradi- 
tion'.' I'd like to get in my two cents. 

1 have lived through three different 
student administrations. In these three 
years, 1 have seen the following come 
and go: 18.000 apathetic students, 54 
apathetic senators, 12 sexist attitudes, 
3 administrator- approved thieves, 2 
pathological liars, and a partridge in a 
pear tree. (I couldn't gel a count on 
apathetic SAB members because they 
haven't had quorum since December.) 

Remember back in high school when 
awards were given out lo Ihe seniors?

Ball neglecting director's duties 



To the Editor: 

1 would personally like to express 
how disgusted I am with all of the ath- 
letic director's support through the 
1991 and 1992 home softball games. 

it is really bad when an athletic direc- 
tor of a college will not even attend a 
home game. IPFW's softball program 
has already turned into a top contender 
of the Great Lakes Valley Conference. 
In the past, he may have drafted people 
from other sports to keep ihe school off 
probation. But with 20 players on this 
year's roster I think the team is far 
from needing people to play just to 
save the school. 

The softball team has a reluming all- 
conference player, and two honorable 
mentions as well as the statistical lead- 
ers of this year. 

Maybe Amie Ball should consider his 
priorities as athletic director and men's 
volleyball coach. It is very obvious 
where his priorities lie. 

I have attended every single women's 
softball game from 1991 to 1992, and I 
have never witnessed one ounce of 
support from the athletic director at 
this university. 

There is one point I would like lo 
make. It is possible lo attend one home 
game. He seemed to make time for 
other athletic events. Twenty-two peo- 
ple involved with the softball team all 
seem to feel it wouldn't have been that 
big of a strain in his life to attend a 
couple of innings over a two-year span. 

One of the saddest aspects of this 



whole situation is thai ihe softball team 
even bothers to care whether he is 
there. The fact remains thai support 
from the athletic director docs not 
exist. 

The 1992 season may be concluded 
with a 7-7 conference record, bul the 
duration of IPFW softball has only just 
begun. There were five double headers 
he could have attempted to just stop by 
to say "Good Luck!" 

Arnie Ball has a lot on his mind with 
volleyball, but he is ihe director of ath- 
letics at IPFW. Don't get me wrong, I 
support his volleyball learn 100 per- 
cent. After all, I even bought my final- 
four tickets two months in advance. I 
guess that is what I gel for supporting 
him, and expecting it in return. 

I'm not even sure he realizes the soft- 
ball team was a close contender for ihe 
'92 tournament. Ii makes my stomach 
turn thai whenever we do get a nice 
compliment or tournament bid that he 
gets the credit. He docs nothing as far 
as support 

Arnie Ball has made a hell of an 
impression in at least 20 lives on the 
softball team. Several of the athletes 
would have been satisfied to hear him 
say good luck or congratulations! 

He even has the nerve to treat the 
women's softball coach, Dale Van 
Houten, like he is a nobody in the alh- 
lelic office. (Not thai Arnie even 
knows he exists.) Considering they do 
not even have a diamond of their own. 

He deserves no credit for any of the 



softball team's victories. I'm not sure 
why I'm even wasting my breath about 
htm, because he is obviously in his 
own little volleyball world. 

I know of at least 25 people who feel 
he is a very poor excuse for an athletic 
director. I'm sure ihcrc is a lot of work 
he does that people never find out 
about, but for heaven's sake why can't 
he just go to a game? There are plenty 
of people in the athletic administrative 
offices that should take over his job as 
athletic director. 

Amic, get your priorities straight and 
stick with men's volleyball.

non-appearances in class are legendary. 
You stay at this university for years, 
make up trouble where there is none, 
all apparently to draw attention to 
yourself. 

How do you finance your 
"education"? Are you getting all kinds 
of financial aid, while students who 
would be serious about their studies 
end up in financial trouble because 
there is no aid left to give? 

The fact that people are on this 
campus taking up space in classes they 
don't attend, taking financial aid they 
don't need, for a degree they may never 
receive, is the true outrage. 

These are the problems students 
should be angry about and take action 
against. We arc tired of your long- 
winded attempts to monopolize our 
attention. We arc tired of your childish 
insistence on having things your way. 

This is not, as you might claim, an 
attempt to hide the truth or stifle your 
free speech. I simply wish to 
communicate to you that your tirades 
have failed to enlighten any of us to 
anything significant. 

If you wish to spend your life 
preaching to an ever- decreasing circle 
of followers, so be it. But stay out of 
the way of those of us who are serious 
about our education. We are planning 
to graduate and get a real life. Why 
won't you do the same?

listen to The Bear because I like what 
they play. If I'm in the mood for pop 
or rap I listen to WMEE. If I'm in the 
mood for what you call "black" music, 
I'll turn to Foxy.' 

That's what the dial is for, Chad! If 
you don't like it, you can turn it. Isn't 
that what living in a free society is all 
about. 



Talk about something "so laughable 
it hurts! I get a headache every time I 
read one of your articles. If you don't 
like what's offered on the air, buy the 
tapes that you like and take your cries 
of pity elsewhere.

Traditional suits still 
best interview attire 



By Mike Wade 
News Editor 

What lo wear lo an interview 
may seem like the least of your 
worries. However, Linda Scolt, 
assistant director for Career 
Services, says students should 
be aware of their appearance — 
employers arc. 

"A first impression is a lasting 
impression. The applicant 
needs to have a professional 
appearance." said Scott. 

Eye contact and a firm hand- 
shake arc also important in con- 
veying a professional image, 
according to Scott. 

"Even women need to demon- 
strate a strong, vertical hand- 
shake. Do not offer your finger- 
tips to the interviewer," said 
Scott. 

WOMEN'S SUITS 

Women should wear a conser- 
vative suit, in a classic fabric 
such as wool. Navy, gray, tan, 
arid even black are appropriate 
colors for an interview suit, 
according to Scott. 

"Red should be avoided. A bit 
on a handkerchief or scarf is all 
right, but in general red is a 
bad color choice," said Scott. 

Be sure the kick pleat and 
vent, the slit in the back of the 
suit coat, arc properly aligned, 
said Scott. 

Although modern styles lean 
to the short skirt, the skirt of an 
interview suit should cover the 
kneecap, according to Scott. 

MEN'S SUITS 

Men also should dress in a 
conservative suit, in a classic 
fabric. Scott recommends that 
the applicant avoid polyester, 
and slick to single breasted suit 
jackets. 

Be sure the vent in the back of 
the suit jacket is sewn evenly, 
said Scott. 

Men should stay away from 
sponscoats; they are too casual 
for an interview, according to 
Scott. 



Shirts should have long 
sleeves, even when worn under 
a suit jacket. A clean cuff 
should be visible, according to 
Scott. 

"A cotton and polyester blend 
for a shirt will allow your body 
to breathe while preventing 
wrinkles," said Scott. 

WOMEN'S SHOES 

Closcd-toc, leather pumps are 
the recommended footwear for 
the interview. The heels should 
be relatively low, and conserva- 
tive in color, according to 
Scott. 

Shoes should also be well pol- 
ished and repaired, if not new, 
said Scolt. 

"It really stands out when you 
see someone in a neatly pressed 
suit, and they are wearing old 
shoes that have scuff marks on 
the toes and heels. It's not 
attractive, and it can spoil the 
outfit." said Scott. 

MEN'S SHOES 

Leather shoes arc appropriate. 
Dress shoes that lace arc 
preferable to loafers, but 
loafers are acceptable, accord-

ing to Scott. 

All shoes need to be well pol- 
ished and maintained. If the 
applicant docs not wear new 
shoes, the shoes need to be free 
of all scuff marks, worn heels, 
and cracks, said Scott. 

DO'S AND DON'TS 

Men, do not wear ankle socks. 
They interrupt the flow from 
your trousers to your shoes. 

Men, do wear your suit jacket 
when you conduct business. 

Men. do keep hair and nails 
clean and neat. 

Women, don't overpower your 
appearance with heavy per- 
fume. 

Women, don't wear elaborate 
hairstyles. 

Women, don't wear an abun- 
dance of jewelry. 

Women, do wear makeup that 
is natural looking. 

"Remember to show confi- 
dence in your ability, and a 
smile never hurts," said Scott.

Student charges sexism 



To the Editor: 

This letter is lo inform you and the 
other staff members of The 
Communicator that I was greatly 
offended by the article about student 
senate in the April 16 issue. 

1 am a female senator on the student 
senate, so the offense was two-fold: 1. 
Not all the senators on the student 
senate arc males, thus should not be 
referred to as such. 2. To exclude a 
particular sex from the context that 
may be relative to her or him. via the 
use of a pronoun not compatible with 
the sex of the person(s) being 
addressed is sexist and exclusive lan- 
guage. 

I suggest that you. The 
Communicator staff, and readers of 
this paper consult the article and issue 
to which I am referring to under- 
stand more completely what it is I 
am saying. 



An article was printed in The 
Communicator on April 16 reporting 
new provisions being applied, possi- 
bly, to senators on student senate. 
The statement out of context reads: 
"the senate then could vote to allow 
him to stay ... ." 

Hear my complaint and the com- 
plaints of other women who demand 
that sexism be eliminated. The author 
of the article suggested that the use of 
the generic pronouns him. he, his, etc. 
are by rules of grammar. Well, in the 
world of women such words do not 
apply. 

Times arc changing, folks. I will 
continue to read your papCT on the 
defense, watching for such sexism 
and exclusive language until I can feel 
comfortable that The Communicator 
does not subscribe to such prejudice.

Writer responds 

To the Editor: 

I would like to thank S. Folk for her 
response to my letter. I would like to 
point out that she both missed my 
point and proved my point. 

Ms. Folk's response assumes that 
because 1 am pro-choice I am also pro- 
abortion. 

It is not so. 

Perhaps the real problem is "wc have 
cars but do not hear." 

Wc do not listen. 

To restate the message of my origi- 
nal letter, pro-choice and pro-abortion 
are not one and the same.

Indiana Jeske heads digs; 
reasearchers use patience 



By Mary Shrock 
Slaff Writer 

Sievcn Spielberg's hii movie, 
"Indiana Jones", glamorized the life 
of an archaeology professor. 

IPFW has its own version of Indiana 
Jones, but he docsn'i do his work in 
the steamy jungles of Brazil or ihe 
arid deserts of the Middle East. 

Robert Jeske does his field work in 
the Midwest. 

Specifically, Jeske said he focuses 
his work in Wisconsin, Ohio, Illinois, 
New Mexico and Indiana. 

From May 19 to June 12 Jeske will 
lake 20 students and a field assistant 
to the site of the home of Chief 
Richardville. located on the south side 
of Fort Wayne. 

Richardville was a Miami Indian 
Chief who played a key role in 
keeping the Miami Indian tribe 
together, said Jeske. 

The archaeological dig will provide 
a historical background of the site and 
will also serve as a field school for 
students who want to sec First hand 
what an archaeologist docs, said 
Jeske . 

"Unlike the classroom, kids do 
aciual scientific research. It's not like 
a lab experiment- Wc impress that on 
students to let them know how 
important they are. They are research 
assistants," he said. 

Jeske is also planning a second trip 
to a Roman Catholic Mission in New 
Starve Rock, IIL 

The second trip will focus on a site 



that stretches a mile long and 300 
yards across. 

It's called the Zimmerman site and 
dates back 1,000 years. 

Jeske said he will be specifically 
looking for house structures. 

"Food storage pits leave a 
discoloration in the soil. These give 
us ideas of past activities, such as 
diet," Jeske said. 

Lawrence Kuznar, also a professor 
of anthropology, said, "Patience is a 
virtue in field work. People should be 
prepared to spend many long, boring 
hours under die hot sun." 

However. Kuznar did point out that 
archaeological digs are not without 
enjoyment. 

"Professor Jeske is lots of fun. After 
the day is over, a lot of time is spent 
in comradcry," Kuznar said. 

William Baden, Vax Systems 
manager, did some archaeological 
survey work while in graduate school. 

"The purpose of field school is to 
teach students about collecting data. 
It's a learning experience," Baden 
said. 

Baden said that the work Jeske is 
doing is particularly interesting 
because it involves Fori Wayne's 
history. 

"People aren't just digging up the 
remains of some remote Indian tribe, 
ihcy're digging up their own past," 
he said. 

Perhaps somewhere out there among 
the JPFW students, a future Indiana- 
Jones-Jeske waits to be discovered. 



Profile 



Professor combines history with humor 



By Gene Conn 
Guest Writer 

Shots rang out in the classroom. 
First one, then two others. Student 
reaction was immediate. Some 
ducked for cover, the rest burst out in 
laughter, Alex Kyrou, blank pistol in 
hand, got them again. 

Kyrou is a big man with a wide girth, 
which he constantly jokes about. He 
has very dark eyes, and curly, black 
hair that is rapidly losing the battle 
with his forehead. 

He loves to tell jokes, especially at 
his own expense. No matter what, 
though, his classroom is a madness 
with a method. 

As a visiting professor of history, 
Kyrou began leaching here last year. 
But don'l be surprised if he stays 
around for a while. 

"He is one of our best new 
professors. The students, and his 
colleagues, are very enthusiastic about 
him," said Gary Blumenshine, chair of 
the department of history and political 
science. 

Kyrou, 33, was born in Kastoria, 
Greece and immigrated with his 
family to New York in 1961. From

there they moved to Fort Wayne in the 
early 1960s. A 1976 graduate of 
South Side High School, he graduated 
from 1PFW in 1980 with a bachelor's 
degree in history. 

Kyrou received his master's degree 
from Indiana University in 
Bloomington, where he taught until he 
relumed to Fort Wayne. His main 
area of study is the modem Balkans. 

Kyrou's cultural heritage and family 
history have played a large part in 
determining his career in history. 

"It was the stones that my family 
told me about my grandfather that 
sparked my interest in history as a 
young boy," Kyrou explained, 
absently fingering a set of Greek 
worry beads. 

His enthusiasm for the subjects he 
teaches is obvious to anyone that sils 
in on one of his classes, but be 
prepared for the unexpected. Even the 
outline on the blackboard usually 
contains some surprises. 

Topics such as "Movies 1 Saw With 
the Sultan" or "Fudge Recipes and 
Prison Reform" are just everyday 
experiences for Kyrou's students. 

"Teaching is, in pan, reflective of 




Egg drop project 'fun 



By Janet Ausbury 
Staff Writer 

Students from an elementary design 
class gathered on the third floor of the 
parking garage to demonstrate their 
skills in an egg-dropping exhibition. 

Dr. Aly Mahmoud, who (caches the 
engineering course, assigned the 
project to his students to emphasize 
the importance of safe, carefully 
constructed engineering designs. 

"It's one thing to break an egg," said 
Mahmoud, "but if you design a bridge 
thai docsn'i hold up, people can be 
hurt or killed." 

The egg drop was not a competition 
but instead a chance for students to 
prove that their designs would work. 

Successful designs included an 
elevator mechanism using a pulley and 
an empty Pepsi can, and various 
contraptions using parachutes and 
padding for the eggs. 

Mahmoud described one design he 



found striking, which resembled a hot 
air balloon-type aircraft with wings. 
However, because this design was 
flame-propelled, high winds prevented 
it from functioning properly. 

Mahmoud was not sure whether this 
experiment has ever been used in an 
IPFW class before. He and his 
students were pleased with the results, 

"I would say that 25 percent of the 
eggs were broken, another 25 percent 
were cracked, and 50 percent did not 
break al all," he said. 

The egg-drop project is not just fun 
but requires research, careful 
calculations, and hard work, 
Mahmoud stressed. 

"The designs must be presented in a 
scientific way. It is science put in a 
format that will be fun. If learning is 
not fun, it becomes a burden. With this 
project, the students have fun, but they 
also learn that you cannot make 
mistakes."

personality. I don't view scholarship 
and leaching as pallid and lifeless. I 
lake it very seriously. 1 don'l 
necessarily elevate myself lo 
seriousness," Kyrou said. 

He explains lhai this use of comedy 
in the classroom is a method to gel 
into the minds of his sludenis. 

"There is a cerlain utility in bringing 
comedy into ihe classroom when and 
where it is appropriate. It lends 
greater focus and definition to the 
structure of a given leclurc," said 
Kyrou. 

Mindy Ing. senior and hisiory major 
said, "Al is probably one of ihe best 
professors I've had here. He's 
hilarious while at the same time you 
have to be impressed by his 
knowledge." 

Not all of his students share his 
enthusiasm. 

Susanne Schuman said, "He can be 
a litde gross sometimes. That doesn't 



bother me, though, as much as when 
he suddenly shouts something out in 
class. He can really scare you." 

Kyrou acknowledges thai ihcsc 
sentimenls have also been reflected in 
the student evaluations that he has 
received. 

"I realize that noi everyone will 
understand that this is a valid and 
efficacious method of teaching," said 
Kyrou. 

Kyrou feels very confident that the 
majority of his students arc gelling his 
point. Every one of his upper-level 
students are passing this semester. 
Besides that, not a single student 
dropped his class. 

"Where do I sec myself in ten years 
from now? Probably managing a 
souvlaki joint in Astoria. Queens, but 
ideally a dream for mc would be to see 
myself as a permanent faculty member 
in history here at IPFW," said Kyrou.

Volleydons finish fourth 



By Joe Heersche 

Sports Editor 

The Volleydons' sophomore seller, 

Lloy Ball, may want to consider a 

fulurc as a sports writer. 

Ball was able to sum up [he 
performance and the general feeling of 



momentum going into game five," 
Nicvcs said. 

The Volleydons faced a barrage of 
attacks by Stanford's multi-talented 
hitlers in game five as it had the entire 
match. Ryan Moos hit S3 percent. 
Duncan Blackman hit 52 percent, and 



the Volleydons after their semi-final John Bczmalinovie hit 47 percent. 



s to No. 1 ranked Stanford in the 
NCAA Volleyball Final Four with one 
word, "Incor tc." 

The VollcjuOns were not able to 
punctuate their strong comeback in 
games three and four with a win in the 
decisive fifth game of the match. 

Stanford, who took an early lead in 
the match with wins in games one and 
two by a score of 15-11 in each, 
weathered the Vollcydon comeback 
and broke their momentum to lake 
game five, 15-10. 

IPFW won games three and four by 
scores of 15-11 and 15-13, after 
making adjustments to their game plan. 

"We got more aggressive with 
serving," said coach Ball. 

"Their passing then broke down," 
Ball added. 

Stanford coach Ruben Nievcs agreed. 
"They made adjustments that turned 



Blackman led all hitters with 28 kills, 
followed closely by teammate Dave 
Goss with 27. As a team. Stanford hit 
55 percent in game five. 

Blackman summed up the win: "The 
consistent team wins. The experienced 
team wins." Stanford is 5-0 in matches 
lasting five games this season. 

"We let ourselves down. They 
don't kill you, you kill you." 
-Lloy Ball 



thi 



Lloy Ball, however, places the blame 
on IPFW. "We let ourselves down. 
They don't kill you. you kill you." 

IPFW averaged 23 percent in attacks 
for the match, but they had extremely 
accurate hitters. Raul Papalco had 18 
kills on 50 percent attack average, and 
Tom Juhnke had 9 kills on 53 percent 
gs around. They're a heck of a attack average. Quentin Spiegel had 14 



team, very well coached." 

After the opening block by IPFW 
senior Neil Day in game five, a service 
error by Lloy Ball allowed Stanford to 
score an easy point and turn the tide of 
momentum. 

"We did a great job recovering in 
game five. We did not have the 



kills for IPFW, and Norma 
Almodovar had 11. Lloy Ball had 66 
assists. 

Ball's nemesis, Stanford setter 
Canyon Ceman, had 89 assists, but 
committed 10 service errors.

final match, again only needed three 
games as they swept Stanford in the 
championship match on Saturday. 

IPFW. emotionally drained from the 
marathon match against Stanford, lost 
in three games to Pcnn State in the 
consolation match. 



Choices dwindle for Volleydons in future 



By Joe Heersche 
Sports Editor 

Two down, two to go. The IPFW 
Volleydons if they are to accomplish 
new goals in the next two years, have 
diminished their choices to two. 

Wiih a loss to Penn State on 
Saturday in the consolation match for 
the national championship, IPFW 
ended the 1992 season with a fourth 
place finish in the country. 

Last season, the Volleydons finished 
third by beating the Nittany Lions in 
the consolation match in Hawaii. 

What's left is a choice between a 
second place finish, or to win the 
national championship. 

Certainly, the preferred choice would 
be to move right into the national 
championship place, but the 
Volleydons must first overcome an 
obstacle. 

In big matches the Volleydons must 
be able to muster the will to beat 
nationally -ranked California teams. 

This includes starting the match 
without being intimidated, exercising 
consistency throughout the match (i.e., 
the fifth game), and playing the match 
not only as a setter and a hitter, but 
also passing, digging, and blocking 
with enthusiasm. 

It is almost certain IPFW will face a 
highly touted California school if they 
reach the NCAA Final Four in future 
seasons. 

The first round or semi-final round is 
the likely meeting place, since 
historically two California teams have 
competed as the first and second seeds 
matched against a Midwest and East 
opponent as the third and fourth seeds. 

The obstacle, therefore, exists for 
IPFW at the semi-final level where 
they will need the will to advance to 
the final match. 

A national championship team for 
IPFW will also need this will. 
However, the intimidation will have 
been overcome by a semi-final 
victory. 

If the Volleydons arc able to bypass 
a second-place finish in the next 
season it would be a great 
accomplishment However, it may be 
too large a leap for IPFW, and a small 
step may be more plausible. 

Individually, two down and two to 
go also rings true for sophomore 
setter, Lloy Ball. Ball completed his 



second season of eligibility this year 
and has two remaining. 

It is widely acknowledged, Ball 
would be a major player if IPFW 
would win a national championship. A 
setter of Ball's caliber may be 
recruited again at IPFW, but they 
don't come around very often. 

IPFW Sports 
Spotlight 

In 1994. the NCAA Final Four will 
be played at the Memorial Coliseum 
in Fort Wayne. Ball will be in his 
senior year, and the hometown fans 
will fill the Coliseum. Many of this 
year's freshmen will have two years 
playing experience, including the 
Final Four, 



The ingredients for a 1994 National 
Championship for the Volleydons 
looks very appetizing. 

The finished product will too.

Sports editor gets final word of year 



A letter from the Sports Editor: 

With the publication of the 1992 spring 
semester's last newspaper, 1 would like 
to take the time to thank all the readers 
and the sports' fans on campus. My job 
wouldn't be needed if you did not find 
interest in keeping tabs on your IPFW 
sport's programs. Congratulations on 
your support that set an attendance 
record at the U.S.C. volleyball match, 
electrified the atmosphere at home 
basketball games, and even helped the 
baseball team weather a losing season. 
Those students who were not able to 
make any events this semester wilt never 
be able to relive the moments in their 
memory of Eric Vaughn completing a 
fastbreak with a no look pass, watching 
All-American Lisa Miller set records, or 
the Volleydons advance to the Final 
Four. However, nest year will bring new 
athletic contests, new All-Americans, 
and another shot at national titles. To 
those students reluming to campus, your 
continued support is invaluable. And if 
you missed this year's action, you won't 
want to miss next year's. 

Thanks also need to be extended lo all 
athletes nnd coaches who participated 
this year. Your stellar performances 
made reporting more than just a job. 
After lough losses, you exhibited the 
patience to answer my questions on 



what exactly went wrong - like the 
crushing defeat the Volleydons 
experienced at the Final Four. With the 
wins, the words seemed to flow easier, 
which is understandable. Your help 
satisfied the voracious appetite my 
Editor-in-Chief, Jim "Charles Foster 
Kane" Walker, had for direct quotes. 

Finally, I need to thank the Sports 
Information Director, Dave Hilben, who 
provided me with more statistics than a 
lifetime of sports columns could hold. 
Dave also made sure that The 
Communicator was provided with the 
same good scaling, the interviews with 
the athletes and coaches, and the respect 
that the larger local dailies demand. The 
post of sports editor thai I have filled has 
been most enjoyable and an extensive 
learning process for mc. Time 
constraints of my full-time job and 
schooling has sometimes limited my 
creative abilities as a journalist, but I 
always labored to put out the best sports 
stories within my schedule. Next 
semester, I urge interested students to 
get involved as a sports reporter. Not 
only will you have the thrill of your 
name in print, but many employers deem 
it imperative that you have and exhibit 
professional writing skills. Alas, the 
semester has ended and so have I.
