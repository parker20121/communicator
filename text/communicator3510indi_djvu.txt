remarks about Afiican-Aincncans and the Chicken Dance dur- 
ing an Oct. 18 meeting of (he Student Activities Board (SAB) 
The comments were pan of a larger discussion about ihe out- 
come of Midnight Madness and what could have been done 
diffcicnily to make the cvcni more successful, hfailand's 
remarks were in regards lo Ihe 30 minules thai SAB was in 
charge of entertaining Ihe crowd- 

Mailand's comment, according lo IPSGA member Tonya 
Ryan (who was at the meeting and at Ihe time was attending 
as a Sludenl volunteeif. was that "African-Americans cannot 
do the Chicken Dance.' Ryan and other students al Ihe meel- 
ing said that Mailand pmceeded lo explain over Ihe course of 
15 minutes why the group is not capable of doing the donee. 

Although Mailand is nol a member of SAB. she attends 
SAB meetings, which Hike IPSGA meetings) are free and 
open lo the public. 

Mailand. who was interviewed by telephone and who 
later verified her comments in the presence of another 
ncwswriier. Said she wos misinterpreted by ihosc aiiending the 
meeting. She said the comment was, 'African- Americans 
don't want to da the Chicken Dance." Mailand explained that 
hardly anyone got up to participate in Ihe SAB-sponsored 
activity, which is tndicatiii'c of a lack of inteiesl- 

Mailand .said. 'African -Americans, or anybody, can do any- 
Ihing they want." 

Ryan said Mailand was asked repeatedly during Ihe 
meeting to clarify and explain her slalemenl. "We wanled to 
make sure there was no misundersianding." Ryan said- 'She 
(Mailand) said outright thai they couldn't do the dance." 

Three people who were al the meeting filed a formal 
grievance againsl Mailand because of Ihe remarks- 

Mailand said that during Ihe IS minutes the meeting 
alicndecs questioned her about the remarks, no one comment- 
ed that they fell offended. "We should have hammered il out 
right iheTc in die meeting,' Mailand said. 'Why did il have to 
come lo ihis? People were asking questions but no one came 
out and said, 'this offended me." 

Mailand. who is nol Afncan-Amctican, said she made 
Ihe remarks because ihe needs and interests of African- 
Americans on the IPFW campus are not being met by current 
SAB board members or by the activities planned by them- She 



aid prefer The Shde lo the Chicken Dance. I have 
not been lo an African- American function where they've done 
Ihc Chicken Dance.' 

SAB vtilunlecr and professional dcc-jay Jody Rciler. 
who IS a fourih-year sludenl at IPFW. is the owner of Ihc com- 
pact disc used during the Midnight Madness aciiviiy. 

'I've dee-jayed at a number of weddings,, I've been lo 
black weddings, I've been to white weddings... at every wed- 
ding I've ever dee-jayed. they've requested the Chicken 
Dance, arnl QO percent of the people know how to do il. Who 
IS she to judge?' Reiler said. He arrived al Ihe meeting just 
after Mailand finished her commenls. 

Director of Student Life LJDri Bedi Royse. who attended 
both Midnight Madness and Ihe meeting, said she remembers 
the general conversation, bui not die specifics of Mailand's 



'llh 



ol generally by ra 
iiki, "If you say people can't do

Ruyse added that despite not remembering which words 
were used, 'it is not our place to say he or she cannot do Ihis 
or itial." and Ihal 'regardless of (Mailand's role), she should- 
n't say things like thai al all,' 

"The comment probably wasn't appmprialc.' said Nick 
Gray, president of ihe Sludenl Body. 'I don't think she mcanl 
any harm or malicious imenl by what she said- 1 Ihink many 
times you say something and don'l sec how it would offend 
others. I think she was making a general slalemenl and it's 
been blown oul of proportion.' 

Gray, who was noi at the SAB meeting, added. 'If I'd 
heard il in Ihe meeting. 1 wouldn't have thought anything 
about II, Maybe it really only offended one person, but they 
ballooned il up— from Ihe hearsay it's going around as some- 
thing different than what she (says she) said." 

Gray said he did nol understand why some people were 
upset about Mailand's comment. He said if a slwtenl came lo 
his office wilh a complaint regarding the comments, he would 
counsel Ihem lo speak wilh Mailand rather than going to a 
newspaper. When it was explained lo Gray ihat siudenls 
alien ding Ihe meeting queslioived her about the commenls, he 
said. "Maybe Ihcy should have just dropped it. thought about 
what she said and asked her again later when they had a clear- 
Some students and faculty have said Ihc problem isn't 
wilh which verb was used lo link African- Americans and the 
Chicken Dance, what is important is an enlire racial group was 
linked with certain behaviors- 

'll really doesn't matter which way she phrased the com- 
ment.- said Chns Paiterson, director of Mullicullural Sen.iccs- 
"Eilhcr way llic queslion is. would she be Ihe spokesperson on 
whclhcr African-American,; cin do (he Chicken Dance or if 
ihey would want to, I don't know of any person, locally or 
nationally, who could be the spokesperson for all." 

Palierson stoted, 'Mori people represent (he ^rnup Ihal

we do not have a problem with Ihe Chicken Dance, 



Although inlerviewed separately, Patterson and Royse 
spoke similarly on the is.suc of particular aclinlies being 
assigned 10 certain g/oups of people. 'I'm nol sure there's one 
aciiviiy that applies jusl lo one group." Patterson said "How 
do we gauge whal is one type of aciiviiy or another?" Roysc 
queried. 

President of Black Collegiale Caucus (BCCI Tenance 
Alexander said Ihal Mailand approached him aboul getting 
members oftheBCC to join SAB so that the black communi- 
ty would be better represented, "To me. il's slereotyping. 
You're pul on the board lo speak for ihe students, not a select 

In regard lo Mailand's commenls, Alexander said, "For 
me. il was nol aboul the Chicken Dance, it was aboul speak- 
ing for me. You cannot speak for any community. In neither 
SAB nor Senate guidelines, does it say. 'we'll have an Asian 
repiesentalive and an African- American icprcscniaiive,,,' il 
says we will have lepresenlativcs for the siudenls," Alexander 

Mailand. who said she would like lo serve again next 
year as a student representative, did not have any specific sug- 
gestions as to what types of enlenainmcnl would meet the 

"There ought lo be something that would interest a 
diverse group of people- they (SAB) arc bringing in the same 
type of enlenainmenl and there's no diversity in il al all. Il's

'You have to consider family -oriented aelivilies where 
siudenls could bring Iheir children on Fridays and Saturdays," 
Mailand continued. She said that enlertainers can be instruct- 
ed as to whether the maierial should be rated PG or R and that 
students should make their interests known to lepresenlalives 
because SAB operates wilh a large budget.

Expose yourself to opportunity Teacher evaluations worth pursuing 



snimnarT, 



Many of us say. 'There 
• \in'\ anything fun to do in this 

town.' I challenge each of j'ou 
'to aik yourself if you actively 
'Seek out different things to do. 
! Or do you just do what comes 
; passively your way? Or do you 

just do things that arc comfon- 
, able and familiar to you? Over 

the weekend, one of my friends 
, mentioned that there wasn't 
' anything lo do. t can recall a 
'. time when, as a youngster. I 
; would make that very same 
■statement and my mother 

would reply with, "Sure, there 
', IS plenly lo do. You could dusi, 
; you could read, you could bake 
' something, etc' 

I ihank my mother for 

mentioning those things 

and capable of cnletlaining 
Imyscif with otherwise ordinary 
:meani. However, now that 1 
'am much older and my enter- 



moulh, strange looks of aston- 
ishment and questioning 
immediately fell across their 
faces. Perhaps they were taken 
back because I am not a lesbian 
and I hey have the precon- 

(attending a drag show and 
being homosexual) are syn- 
onymous with one another. On 
ihe contrary, 1 disagree. There 
can be as much enlenainmeni 
and amusement gained from 
attending a drag show as there 
can be from attending a movie.

:iPFW had its third annual drag

Whenlaskedsomeofmy

me, some mentioned ihey were

they had no desire to go. 
Coincidenully, the person who

what classes you need lo take to gradu- 
ate, registering and paying for the class-

ple, some classes are only otTcrcd once a 
year and some even once every other 
year. Untonunately. there is no way to 
accurately predict when those classes 
are going to be offered. 

Similarl], for students who are 
unfamiliar with the depanments from 
which they ore taking a class, choosing 
the proper professor can be just as com- 
plicated. All professors have iheir down- 
falls, of course, with some more pro- 
nounced ihan others. A professor can 
also have good points that may make 



] better choice for a 



s Ihan 



really is no way of find- 
ing out who Ihe preferable professor to 
lake would be for sludenls who don't 
already know, save trackingdown some- 
one who has already had ihc professor 
before and asking them. 

Unfonunaiely. as far as finding out 
when panicular cla.sses arc offered. 



. mclhod cannoi 
for classes not being offered due lo a 
lack of instruclois to teach Ihe class, but 
no method really can. Having a way lo 
see if a class is offered more than one 
semester in advance would be prefer- 
able, but not always possible. 

What would be possible, however, 
is a solution lo Ihe problem of nol know- 
ing anyihing about a given professor. 
One idea Hoating around the rumor mill 
is that IPFWs student government moy 
have teacher evaluations posted online 
via Ihe IPFW homepage for students to 

teacher they should lake for a panicular 
class. These evaluations would be noth- 
ing more Ihan a collection of the evalu- 
ations performed by students at the end 
of each semester lumped together and 
put up on the Web. Though a good idea, 
ihere are a number of questions raised in 
proposing this idea that would need to 
be addressed. 

The first and most obvious question 
would be who would be left in charge of 
undertaking this project. In my opinion, 
the depanmenis could possibly be 
biased in handling their own evalualions 
(or fear of students being shied away 
from Iheir Subject. I personally do nol 
know of any department heads who 
would, but Ihe opportunity would be 
■here. After all. who would want lo post 
I bad evaluation about Uiemselves? 

The schools would be another can- 
didate 10 rule oul because, as is Ihe case 
with Ihe registrar's office, diey already 



The second question would involve 
the factors by which students judge their 
professors. None of the rpjcstions really 
means anything to the average student, 
in my opinion. Beller questions Ihan 'Is 
this teacher prepared most of Ihe time?" 
would need to be picked, such as "Is this 
professor boring?' or 'How difficull are 
the tests?' Granted, those questions may 
not be as polite as the other questions, 
but critiques ore not always cheerful. 
Besides, that is what matters lo most of 
the people I know. 

The final question is related to the 
first and is a question dial should be 
asked in every silualton: Is it worth Ihe 
money and time it would lake to do Ihis? 
Obviously die project would be a large 
undertaking and would cost money lo 

More than likely, someone would 






need lo be hire 

lions. Someone would have to post the 
evalualions in whatever form diey took. 
Someone would have to (again, in my 
opinion) streamline the questions lo 
make them more useful to students. Il 
would no doubt be a big project and big 
projects are not done by Ihe m selves. 






isi derations. 2 
i still ri 



with St 






be answered about Ihis project, I det- 
nitely think it is an idea the school 
ihould Investigale further. Such an idea 
:ould save sludenls and teachers bolh a 

01 of wasted time, as well as possibly 
eliminate the stress involved with pick- 
ng Ihe right teacher, when that option 
Misis. Though a lot of questions have 
'Ct to be answered, students having

'There are many issues ihal people uen'l aware of

; Emerson is lunnmg on a diverse plaironn ihal 
eruompasies changes she wants lo make in women's 
heallhcaie. the elemenlary school and state prison insli- 
julions and the war on drugs. 

Emerson calls herself an egalitarian. Her oppo- 
nent. Republican Incumbent Gloria Goeglein, has held 
■he 84lh dislrici ofTice, %vhich includes much of the Si. 
;ae Road area, since 1990.

refiwm plans go hind in hand with how she wiiuld 
like to see Ihe war on drugs modified. 

■The war on drugs slanot oui as lomelhing

upon whit people do. Not cver&gt;Dne under drug 
mHuence goes Out and commits crimes. Tlicre 
reeds to be a division between criminal iclivilies 
caused by and associated with drugs and recre- 
ational, noncriminal use of drugs." 

Emerson also believes olhct changes 
need lo be made in similar criminal bchnnors. She 
believes that perimeleis should be established 
where in certain places, panicularly outside of 
cities, prostitution and drug use are legal. Thew 
areas, she says, would be safe environmcnls rnon-

in them, particularly prostitutes, would be .'iafe, 
and less susceptible to being murdeml or banned. 

Emerson thinks Ihal people will 
embrace these issues because a lot of the lime Ihey 
are afraid lo speak out aboul them. "Even I have 
reservations of speaking up agalnsi it," she said, 
"but I feel that it isjusi in me to cipress this. These 
are issues Ihal need to be addressed." Other candi- 
dates and people in Ihe business, she believes, arc

Dr Scon Kincaid, a family practitioner published

specialist at Parkview Hospital, states that testicular 
cancer Is very curable, even in conjunction with metas- 
tasis. She stresses the importance of early deleclion of 
die disease dirough using monthly TSE 

Several steps should be taken lo assure a thorough 
self-e^aminanon. TSE Is best performed after a warm 
baih or shower when Ihe scrotal sac is more relaxed. 
Begin by visually Inspecting the scrotum while standing 
m front of a minor ll is not abnojmal for one testicle to 
be slightly larger and suspend lower than Ihe other. 
Observe for discoloralion of Ihe skin and note any 
swelling, whether solid or fluid filled. Be conscious of 
any discomfort, aches, or heaviness in your lower 
abdomen, groin, scrotum, or back. 

Examine each testicle for any lump or changes in 
si2e. Using Ihe thumb and forefinger apply gentle pres- 
sure and roll Ihe testicle while noiing any lumps or 
changes in size. The testicles should feel firm, smooth, 
and oval in shape Be sure to palpale the entire surface 



including the epididymis that lies posterior lo each tes- 
ticle. This cordlike siruclure. which carries sperm front 
the lesticle. should also be free of lumps and cnlargc- 
fnenl. In a study presenled in Cancer Practice, il is 
reported that at least IS percent of men have a varico- 
cele, an enlarged Iwisling vein. Ihal can cause Icsljcular 
lumps or swelling. Any abnormality or concern shoulil 
be immediately addressed ivilh a hcaldicarc provider. 

Survival rates of testicular cancer can be consider-

George W, Bush has been the govemai (or the past rive 
years, has the highest exeeuiion rale in Ihe couniiy. ll

esl govern iH, Bush, 

Bui transcending a governorship lo Ihe presidency 
has many polilical analysts and well-known magazines, 
particularly U.S. News and World Repair, queslioning 
his obihties. Likewise they question Vice President aird 
Democratic candidate Al Core. 

Bush's detractors focus an what they see as Ihe 
nans inhis platform and pubhc persona, 
, U.S. News and World Repon calls Bush a limiled 
govemmenl pioponenl who plans lo do nothing major 
in his Tinl 100 days in ofTice. Bush's detiaclors uondei 
if he will be a pu!:h&lt;&gt;ver. WiW he be a president who does 
not lake action? Will he be a leader or will be lei others 



.Much of the time. 
Ihe accused were poor minorities who received weak 
defense allomeys who got walked all over by, as Ihe 
article title says, Bush's 'Texas Oealh Machine." ^Vhen 
asked gboui these cases Bush, who cosily could have 
mandated a moratorium on any of the$e questionable 
execution], replied, in some coses, Ihal he did not 
remember the specifics of such and such case, \iilers 
should consider what Ihe repercussions these actions 
mighl have should Bush win. What will happen to our 
nation's capital punishment system? Will it cnimhle to 
the point where many innocent men ore being accused 
and found guilty and put lo death simply because our 
iepn:sentalivcs are unwilling lo look into their coses — 
or are willing lo over look fundamental justice practices 
because a scapegoat is needed? 

Granted, Texans seemed to imbibe. Bush's 135 
executions in five years. Eighty percent of them, the RS 
antcle says, arc in favor of his tactics, which include 
speeding up judicial processes, 3ikI eliminating long 
delays and bureaucratic red tape. In theory tactics tike 
these would rid our prisons of many violent criminals 
basking in multiple appeals thai loiie several years to 
muddle through. Unfortunately, as the practice illus- 
uales in real life Teias. allegedly innocent dcalh row 

Then there is the case of Bush's visx lo Bob Jones 
University, a South Carolina college infamous for iLi 
discrimination practices. Bush said nothing untoward 
the school when he spoke there. He may simply have 
Died 10 be polilc and ignore Ihc school's record. Maybe 
he didn'l know about it al all. More importantly, how- 
ever, is what are voters supposed to make ol flush's 
appearance at such a college'? What docs it say about 
him? Was he simply being polite and honoring a speak- 
ing engagement, or did he not realize what die school 

Bush's plaifoim does, however, look promising in 
some areas. One pro-Bush pamphlet says that he wants 
to "usher in the responsibility era" where people lake 
lejponsibilily for their own actions. In a society whose 
inhabitants are quick to put the blame of anything had 
or evil or sinful on someone — anyone — else, this 
arguably is a much-needed change. Where Bush plans 
lo renew this eilinci trait of Americans is in Ihe educa- 
tion system- He plans to make schools responsible for 
their own actions — particularly when a school docs not 
meet the standards of success that other schools set. 
Perhaps our cducalors will Icom by this aciion and will 
iB^ch those being educated basic personal and moral 
responsibility. The pamphlet says Bush will penalize 
failing schools by severing the Tederal funds they 
receive. He also plans lo return supervision of schools 
io the local— and most knowledgeable lo whichever 
particular school — level. ~- ) 

Bush's economics also seem promising, especial- ' 
ly his plans affecting middle and lower class Americans. 
He plans to reduce taxci for every American, end the

Bush's stand on healdicaie^ ^' 

is 10 make qualily health care available to everyone On 
the military angle. Bush plans to increase die pay ihai 
soldiers receive by one billion dollars in total, modern- 
ize weapons and equipment, and overhaul America's 
intelligence network. 

Clinton ond Core's economic record is nearly irre- 
proachable. How much of the current economical boom 
can be atnibuted to the pair is questionable, however, 
considering the rise of the Internet and Ihe national cash 
flow il conjured from former President George Bush's 
stagnant post-Gulf War economy. Obviously Gore plans 
lo keep Ihe economy going steadily as it is. His plans lo 
do this, once in office, are outlined in a 191-page pro- 
posal he and running mate foe Licbeimnn co-wrote. The 
proposal suggests Goic will perpetuate oui nations' eco- 
nomic prosperity by. according to its summary on 
Gore's website, 'balancing Ihe budget and paying down 
the notional debl-to keep interest rates low and eco- 
nomic growth high^ saving Social Security and 
Medicare; cutting taxes to help families and small busi- 
nesses afford key investments in their future; investing 
in new technologies; and opening up foreign markets. 
And Gore will make sure every American can gel the 
quality education and job training they need lo succeed 
in the New Economy." 

Funhcrmore Gore's economic plans include a 
SOO billion dollar lax cut for working families, lax 
relief for stay at home parents, expanded family leave,

Gore's education plans include modernizing 
schools, implementing tax deductions for college 
tuition savings, raising teachers' salaries, and requiring 
all stales lo mandate new, tougher teaching tests thai 
gauge the knowledge and capability of new high and 
middle school teachers. Gore likewise plans lo lay Ihe 
blame of failing schools on die schools themselves. His 
plans will shut down failing schools, reopen Ihem under 
new direction and with new faculty. Additionally Gore 
wants to increase public school choice and invest ovei 
170 billion dollars over the next ten years in our 

On the topic or our military. Gore loo wants to 
increase soldiers' pay by 3.7 percent- He wants to 
improve the military housing system, and supports new 
military technology, Ihe industry base to build weapons, 
and a limited missile defense syslem. 

Gore is also a renowned environmental advocate 
It is no doubt ^lat he will, as his website says, continue 
to support die environment by sanctioning industries 
and continuing lo create protected wildlife and wilder- 

Aldiough (jore seems very clear on what he wants 
lo do, it seems, as U.S. Mew-s and World Repon soys 
that Gore has made numerous promises, \^ters wonder 



how much he will be able lo accomplish. Once in ofTice, 
Gore plans to move quickly, attacking issues like racial 
profiling and Ihe campaign finance system. Gore also is 
all over the map. What dues he really wanl lo do and 
who is ht really loyal to? 

Both candidates' platforms arc lemaikably similar 
in a number of ways. Hoiv they dilTer. however, comes 
across in other prevalent campaign issues. Bush, for 
inslancc, opposes abortion. Gore does nol. Both candi; 
dales oppose gay marriages. Gore suppoiis, however, 
civil unions. Gore suppoits afTirmalive action. U.S', 
News and World Repori says that Bush claims he supj 
pons a patient's bill of rights, as Gore does, yel he 
vetoed a similar bill in Texas. Core plans lo reimbursj 
seniors up to SO percent of what they spend on prc- 
scriplion drugs (which has become an issue because of 

dependence on Ihem, and patliculorly Ihe inability of 
poor senior citizens lo afford essential mcdicalion.) 
Bush's Medicare and prescription drug plan is to give 
Ihc states 4S million dollars lo alleviate the cost of pre- 
scription drugs. This turns out to be around a 25 percent 
reduction of Ihe cost of prescription drugs. 

Currently, all major polls find thai Ihe race is loo 
close to call, with Bush slightly ahead but well withiii 
the margin of en-or. Goie may prove to be the stronger 
candidate. He has the eipericnce of working alongside 
president Clinton. Bush, on the other hand, has made a 
point of not saying he can accomplish an cnoimous 
amount of tasks, as Goie seemingly has,
