Former Gov. Matthew Welsh 
campaigns on campus Tues. 



The two circles of the Cross 
Cultural Dialogues' symbol 
represent the two hemispheres 
of the world united es one. 



Campaigning for the Demo- 
cratic nomination aa gover- 
nor of the State of Indiana, 
former Governor Matthew 
Welsh appeared on campus 
Tuesday afternoon with a 
friendly handahake and 
cordial greeting for stu- 
dents Making his way 
through the lounge and 
cafeteria, Welsh paused fre- 
quently at tahleu and lounge 
chairs to chst with students, 
teachers, and any others he 
chanced to encounter. After- 
wards, he met with etudenta 
in the Students' Government 
Office for an impromptu 
press conference. 

Commenting on the 18 
year old vote, Welsh atated 
that "If they're going to 
make an 18 year old an 
adult by statute, they must 
go all the way." Otherwise, 
he said. "It's Illogical." 
However, 18 year olds must 
assume the responsibilities 
of adults and no longer 
plead youthful innocence if 
additional prlviledges are 
extended to them. Should 
18 be established aa the 
legal age of conaent, it 
muat be "all Inclusive." 

During a discussion of 
higher education, Welsh re- 
marked chat "Poat high 
school education should be 
available to any student 
who wants It on a commuter 
basis." Since higher edu- 
cation could be interrupted 
to include forms of vo- 
cational and technical 
training aa well aa college 
degree programs, Welsh 
suggested, even those who 
do not hold secondary 
school diplomas might be 
eligible to take advantage 
of state poat high school 
facilities. 

On the Issue of estab- 
lishing a direct primary 
system in Indiana, the 
former governor revealed 
hla inclination to favor 
the preaent method of 
chooaing higher atate 
office candidates by means 
of a party convention. 

"We have to look at 
history," Welsh maintained, 
explaining that the prob- 
lems involved in a direct 
primary may preaent diffi- 
culties unforeseen by pro- 
ponents of the direct pri- 
mary. There is such a low 
percentage of voters who 
turn out at the polls In a 
primary election that a 
minority could easily dom-

inate the election and force 
Its candidate upon the 
electorate. Before the 
Btate nomination convention 
was adopted, two Indiana 
governors were elected by 
group controlling the direct 
primary and were later 
accused of corrupt practices 
while serving aa governor. 
One was subsequently found 
guilty snd sent to prison 
while the other was forced 
to reelgn. In addition to 
providing acceaa to elec- 
toral manipulation, the 
direct primary favors s 
wealthy candidate over one 
unable to afford a costly 
campaign. "Any candldstea 
who expect to be taken 
seriously must have great 
sums of money," Welsh pointed 
out. A nominating convention, 
however, limits expenaea 
and provides the less finan- 
cially strong candidate with 
the same opportunity to 
win party support. In 
summing up his thoughts on 
the matter, Welsh offered 
the opinion that "Before 
we choose the direct pri- 
mary, we should know what 
we're getting into." 

Concluding his visit 
with an expression of 
thanks to students for 
the opportunity to spend 
an afternoon on campus, 
Welah diaclosed his in- 
tention to return to 
I-P for a more extensive 
tour later in the year. 



An editorial 

When a student questions 
the content of a course or 
the practices of on instruc- 
tor, he does so at his own 
risk. 

iThe risk is in part merely 
the perception of such. It 
is in part quite real. To 
question such an instructor 
on a serious question such 
as the relative value of the 
Inatructor'a course or the 
Ealrnesa of the instructor's 
grading nracticea la to 
submit oneself to possible 
retribution. Whether there 
is such retribution depends 
upon the openness of the 
instructor to criticism. 

There is often a parallel 
between the openness of the 
instructor to criticism snd 
the nusllty of his teschlng. 
The worst instructors are 
the least open to criticism. 
Hence, those teachers who 
need criticism most are 
lesst likely to get It. 

Currently st this campus, 
the procedure a student 
follows when he seeks redress 
of s course-related griev- 
ance Is to consult the in- 
structor in question, if 
not satisfied he msy inform 
the department or section 
chairman of the problem. 
The department or section 
chairman will then talk with 
the instructor. Solutions 
sometimes result from this 
procedure. But not often. 

If the student Is yet 
unsatisfied, he may take his 
grievance up the academic 
heirarchy. At each point, 
a receptive ear will announce 
thst a conference will be 
held with the Instructor 
In Question. Such an infor- 
mal procedure for redresalng 
student grievances la satis- 
factory for obtaining enough 
desks for students in a 
classroom: but In serious 



matters, sctually serves to 
make the problem worse. It 
Is, in fact, no procedure 
at all. 

First, few students will 
air even legitimate griev- 
ances. Realistically, a 
atudent would have to be 
quite aecure academically to 
per slat beyond the depart- 
ment or section chairman. 
In matr.ci.-3 where s student 
is questioning the grading 
of a particular Instructor, 
the case la often the oppo- 
site. Students are un- 
likely to risk an slready 
insecure position by 
challenging the Instructor. 

Second, students realize 
that those who sre In posi- 
tions of suthority actually 
have little inclination to 
Infringe upon the academic 
freedom of a fellow member 
of the brotherhood. This 
la true even In caaes where 
the person in authority 
sctually aympathizes with 
the student's complaint. 

Academic freedom as such 
Is academic tyranny. 

Severs 1 Indiana University 
students are currently em- 
broiled in a situation which 
may well result in legal 
sctlon against the university. 
This is unfortunate for the 
institution, for the faculty 
member involved, and is a 
needless expense for the 
students involved. It can 
be avoided. 

A functioning body com- 
posed of students and faculty 
members with the power to 
redress student grievances 
and faculty complaints 
sgainst students could pre- 
vent such an extreme situa- 
tion. The students have no 
other alternative than to 
resort to litigation. 

It Is in the interest of 
the faculty that such a body 
be created. It is certainly 
In the interest of the 
student body. 



Rejoinder to Souder 



by Mike Ellis 



In reply to Mr. Souder 's 
article, I wish to attack 
not his personal religious 
faith, but rather the consis- 
tency of the consequences 
of liis argument. Souder 
quotes St. Paul to say that 
we, the masses, must obey 
every law snd governmental 
dictate because the govern- 
ment is ordsined of God. 

He wsnta to read Into 
Paul's words the notion 
that every sctlon the gov- 
ernment does, is done within 
the will of God. For this 
reason, Mr. Souder argues 
that Paul was obviously 
opposed to civil disobedi- 
ence like that of the 
Berr Leans. 

Souder 's argument for 
the Godly government brings 
to mind the old Divine 
Right of Kings concept. It 
must be remembered that 
when Paul wrote of civil 
authority, he meant the 
community, the people in 
their corporate capacity 
through which the laws of 
God could become manifest. 

Nowhere in the Hew Testa- 
ment is the word "state" 
used ss representing a gov- 
ernmental authority. If Paul 
could be Interpreted as 
Souder wishes, why. I ask 
you. was he frequently im- 
prisoned and finslly beheaded 
by the governmental powers'! 
For religiously obeying the 
law? 

If Souder wishes to make 
such an interpretation for 
his own religion, this la 
fine — but he must suffer the 
consequences of believing a 
hypocrit as one of God's 
spiritual leaders! 

Souder quotes Aquinas' 
and several Pope's reaffirm- 



ation of the necessity of 
obeying the civil authority 
because of Its being ordained 
of God. Of course such men 
would argue such a position: 
they were, for the most 
part, the civil authority. 
There existed little separ- 
ation between the church and 
the stste st that time. Does 
this example really have any 
relevance to today' s situation 
at all? 

Let's again assume Souder's 
super-literal Interpretation 
of his' King James and Good 
Hews , end look st II Cor, 
3:17- "Where the Spirit of 
the Lord la, there is Liberty." 
If Mr. Souder la to be con- 
sistent, he must now declare 
that to the extent a govern- 
ment is corrupt and opressive, 
is to the extent the Spirit 
of the Lord is sbsent and to 
the extent the government 
is nor. ordained of God. 

The Bible Is replete with 
examples of spiritual men 
being persecuted for their

I am a coach who is a bit 
upset. I feel that I must 
say that the headline "You

Rejoinder (con. from p. 2) ■ 

Mr. sunder, I agree with 
civil disobedlance. I be- 
lieve that it ie poB8ible 
for the State to become 
more corrupt and oppressive, 
that laws are made by men, 
and that a State can dis- 
regard the needs of humanity, 
calling the civil author- 
ities into question. But 
Mr. Souder cannot recog- 
nize thiB if the governmenta 
are representatives of 
God's will. Besides, even 
if Mr. Souder 1b correct, 
how can the U.S. wage war 
on any communist country 
If all governments are or- 
dained of God? How, Mr. 
Souder? 

Mr. Souder wants tp 
argue that the Berrigan'". 
actions were not pacifistlc 
because a clerk was injured: 
It was brought out in court 
that the clerk Injured her- 
self, but remedied her hor- 
rible injury with a Band- 
Aid. Yea, Mr. Souder, their 
action was nonviolent. 
With regards to the 
Berrigan quote "we've got 
them by the balls": this 
is merely s colloquial ex- 
pression signifying that 
Berrigan had found the weak 
spot of the government. 
I believe that the law of 



Cod is always higher, and 
to be 1 ived before any laws 
of man. If it is necessary 
to break the lsw in order 
to live one's life for God, 
then I say "Break the lsw." 

Mr. Souder, what do you 
do when a government Is un- 
just and oppressive? Obey 
the law and therefore per- 
petuate injustice, mske 
yourself as Immoral aa the 
law itself? Do you squeel 
thst there are proper chan- 
nels when you "mow thst 
those proper chsnnels for 
change have not worked? 
Should any man with a con- 
science have obeyed the laws 
of Hitler because Hitler 
waa ordained of God? What 
do you do, Mr. Souder? 

If you don't live for 
God first, if you forget 
God's higher authority by 
rstionallzing Chat the State 
represents God's will, if 
you live like any other 
scqulescent man, then how 
will the public know that y 
you are in fact a christisn? 
You can't proclaim yourself 
a Child of God when your 
actions give lies to your 
words? You claim to be a 
Christian, Mr. Souder. I 
ask you: what does that 
mean as a public a fact?

strongly urge all studenta

instructors for the summer 
snd fall aemesters. 

This survey, while hsvlng 
the potential for being the 
greatest service the Stu- 
dents' Government provides, 
dissppoints me. This dis- 
appointment stems from the 
lack of participation by 
the faculty. Only 44 in- 
structors were evaluated, 
out of a full-time faculty 
of roughly 225. 

Perhaps, such an evalu- 
ation can never be successful 
at least so long aa It is 
voluntary. Many professors

evaluation forms available 
on th is campus ■ others 
simply do not wish to be

the professionalism of 
teaching puts it above cri-

Why not submit instructors

is a vslid one for measuring 
student accomplishment, I 
am sure it is a vslid one 
for measuring faculty 
eccompllshment. Ab students

" What happens to the ghetto 
happens everywhere" : Russell 



Former Boston Celtics 
basketball star and coach 
Bill Russell demonstrated 
In s campus Convocations 
Program address that hia 
skills are not solely 
limited to the sports realm. 

Admitting that moat of 
his adult life haa been 
devoted to the problem of 
"finding out who I am" and 
"where I live", Russell 
llBted some observations 
he has made on the American 
society while touring the 
nation. 

"I'm looking for patri- 
ots," he atated, defining 
patriots as those who care 
enough about the country to 
expose themselves to danger 
In Its behslf. In Russell's 
view, modern America needs 
more patriots becauae Amer- 
ican citizens are ao Inter- 
dependent. 

"What happens to you hap- 
pens to me, what happens to 
me happens to you." he 
stressed . "I 've got to look 
out for you and you've got 
to look out for me. " 

This belief Is evidenced 
by such problems as drug 
addiction, Rueaell noted, 
which Bpread from ghetto 
areas to suburbs because 
citizens did not realize 
that drug abuse prevention 
and education were In the 
best Interests of all cit- 
izens 25 years ago. In this 
Instance, what happened in 
the ghetto bIbo occurred 
in middle American suburbs. 
Likewise, the National 
Guard which etood duty In

later appeared at Kent State 
and on college campusea 
across the nation. 

Once again, "what hap- 
pens to the ghetto happens 
everywhere. We're all here 
together." A good citizen 
must realize this fact and 
be concerned with good and 
bad everywhere. In Russell's 
eyes, some of the complex- 
ities of the American soci- 
ety are the Ironies exem- 
plified by national prior- 
ities and national pride. 

"It doesn't make sense 
how citizens can turn their 
backs on fellow citizens... 
we spend billions on for- 
eign aid and then hate our 
neighbor for being on wel- 
fare." 

As Russell mentioned, 
there are rocket ships on 
Mars while a school system 
closes down for lack of 
funds. Americs spends mil- 
lions every year on a war 
ten thousand miles from 
home, and lands men upon 
the moon, while 14 million 
go to bed hungry every 
night. "It's strsnge." 
he remsrked softly. 

"We lead the world In 
a lot of things, but not 



morality and humaneness. 
I hope we're prepared to 
be leaders In morality." 




Former Celtic star Bill Russell 
spoke on campus Monday as part 
of Black Awareness Week, spon- 
sored by the Blsck Students' 
Union of Indlsna-Purdue.

COMMUNITAS 



by Scotl Gillie 



ALIENATION, ANOMIE AND THE 
AMERICAN STUDENT Part 3 



At Che center of alienation It Is unreasonable to ex- 



i self Is a loss of be- 
lief In the efficacy of one's 
actions to manipulate one's 
environment. Power lessnesa 
la the watchword of atudent 
(and societal) apathy. "I'm 
only one person," "I'm a 
small cog In a giant machine.' 
"I Just work here." "What 
can I do?" Such statements 
do not Indicate a failure 
of Institutions. These 
statements indicste the 
ultimate triumph of Insti- 
tutions over people. 

Reforming an institution 
to be more humane generally 
takes the form of central- 
izing the decision; making 
apparatus in order for the 
institution to "better per- 
form its assigned functions." 
Sort of like using gasoline 
to put out a fire. 

We are alienated, and 
most people feel powerless 
to improve conditions. 
Those who do seek to im- 
prove the quality of life 
reform institutions. 
Through the efforts of the 
reformers, the institutions 
Streamline, implement coldly 
efficient mansgement tech- 
nologies, and through ton 
aolidation of departments 
(to reduce duplication), the 
institutions function in- 
dependent of any services 
they render for human 
beings. 

Each reform increases 
the strsnglehold of the 
institutions. The least 
alienated members of society 
(those who do not feel 
powerless) are aggrandizing 
the conditions which foster 
alienation. 

Not many people are fooled 
by the claima of the insti- 
tutional reformers, whether 
they be "The Great Society" 
or the "New Army." Yet we 
perceive no alternativea. 

The counter culture has 
had a devastating impact 
upon belief in the efficacy 
of efforts to improve our 
society. The American 
Dream myth has been ex- 
ploded. War, racism, and 
pollution are the concerna 
of the young. Gratitude 
to the elders is not s 
frequent expression In the 
literature or muBlc of the 
counter culture. 

The elders of America 
have been pushed into de- 
fending their technological 
and material accomplishments . 
The elders' faith in techno- 
logy has been severely 
shaken, but the challenge 
of the counter culture has 
forced them to dig in. 

February 18, 1972 



pect them to admit to wor- 
ship of a false god. It 
is consistent to expect 
from the elders prescrip- 
tions which embrace s hard- 
ened fslth In technology. 

Perhaps because, deep 
down, the eldera senae that 
faith in technology haa 
been misplaced, the de- 
fense of the aystem is all 
the more zealous. 

Recognition of alter- 
nativea to an exploitative 
technological system will 
be resisted by three 
generations which placed all 
their chips on technology. 
No doubt, thiB resistance 
contributes to the senae of 
alienation and powerleasness 
among members of the 
counter culture. 

Alienation from aelf is 
manifest by a separation of 
thought and action. A per- 
son la not likely to act 
according to his beliefs if 
he has no faith that such 
sn act will have significance,

UP AGAINST 
THE WALL 



Having been directly 
involved in the latest 
Faculty Evaluation, I feel 
that the Students' Govern- 
ment should no longer admin- 
ister the evaluation. I 
call upon all of the faculty 
to band together, Initiate 
their own evaluation, and 
demand that they be evalu- 
ated by the students with 
the results published. 

When only a few instruc- 
tors submit to a student 
evaluation, the result is, 
in my opinion, extremely 
unrepresentative. Let's 
face the facte, only a 
fool would give his stu- 
dents the right to evaluate 
him If he had anything to 
fear. In my opinion, there 
are some professors at 
this csmpus who would have 
something to fesr if their 
students were given the 
opportunity to evaluste 

One of the major draw- 
backs of thi8 present 
evaluation Is that some very 
good instructors sre made 
to look bad. I say this be- 
cause all of the scores re- 
ceived by the faculty were, 
in my opinion, very good. 
No instructor rpceived a 
score of less than five on 
his overall evaluation. A 
score of five is average. I 
suggest that if sll of the 
approximately 225 lnatructors 
on this campus had taken the 
evaluation there would have 
been plenty of scores under 
the five mark, and perhaps 
some of the scores would 
have been extremely low. 



by Sieve Evans 

The students on this cam- 
pua should be very grateful 
to the Instructors who had 
the guts to let the stu- 
dents have the opportunity 
to evsluate them. As stu- 
dents, we sre evalusted by 
our instructors all semester, 
snd I suggest thst this 
should be a reciprocal pro- 
cess. The Faculty Evalu- 
ation can be an effective 
tool for the students when 
they plan their classes in 
the coming semester. 

Don't bother to look at 
the scores received by the 
instructors when using the 
Faculty Evaluation, simply 
look for the names of the 
Instructors who partici- 
pated. Perhapa some of 
them, even the ones with 
relatively low scores, 
actually regard students aa 
their peers and not only a 
means by which they can sup- 
port their families

current manifestations of 
this struggle Is the abor- 
tion controversy. The 
principle Involved Is the 
killing of an Innocent hu- 
man being because his 
existence Is inconvenient 
or uncomfortable to others. 

The fifth grade sex 
educstlon text in the Hew 
York City school system says, 
"Humsn life begins when the 
sperm cella of the father 
and the egg cella of the

other 



nlte.' 



Dr. Charles Rice of the 
Notre Dame Law School adds: 
"When the child In the 
womb weighs only one- 
thirtieth of an ounce, he 
has every internal organ 
he will ever have as an 
adult. On the eighteenth 
day after his conception 
his heart starts beating, 
At eighteen weeks, he can 
suck his thumb, scratch him- 
self and even cry, although 
he makes no sound because 
there is no air in the 
womb. He can feel pain." 

The methods of accomp- 
lishing this murder are 
horrendous. Until the twelfth 
week after conception, a 
common procedure is dilation 
of the entrance to the uterus 
and curettage. The whole 
uterine cavity la curretted 
with short strokes, by 
visualising a clock and 
making a stroke at each 
hour. A small forcepts 
is used to pull out the 
tissue. Fetal parts such 
as arms, legs, and a head 
are recognizable in preg- 
nancies beyond the seventh 
wrek. 

Bt-yond the fourteenth, 
week of omgnancy, the child 
can be killed in two ways. 
One is to inject a salt or 
glucose solution into the 
womb. By this means, the 
baby is simple nlckled 



babies. Put them in simu- 
lated wombs and feed them 
through the cord, poking 
them now and again to see 
if they are still alive." 

Christians cannot possibly 
condone such an abhorrent 
perversion of God's plan. 
Nor do I see how anything 
but a hypocritical Christian 
could vote for a candidate 
for oublic office who would 
support such a brutal vio- 
lation of the most basic 
human right. To claim Ita 
murder, and then to vote 
for an advocate of it is 
blatant hypocrisy. 

A good conservative 
friend of mine, who is a 
columlst for the Indiana 
Dally Student at Bloominton, 
received an irate letter 
from a girl who sounded aa 
if Baron had gotten her preg- 
nant, after he wrote a 
critique of the abortion 
claque. She whined on about 
how he was hard-hearted and 
calloused concerning the 
mother's right to play cards 
or go bowling when she 
desired. If a mistake. 
Innocent or not, Is made, 
butchering the baby hardly 
rectifies it. 

If a person loses his 
struggle sgalnst Evil, he 
most certainly is not pro- 
mised a bed of roses.

Feb. 26 is next student aid film 



Last Saturday night, the 
first In a series of movies 
was held at the campus. The 
purpose of these movies Is 
to provide the Financial 
Aids Office with funds to 
be given to low-Income stu- 
dents. At present, the 
club feels that there are 
too many qualifications and 
red tape in processing 
scholarships, grsnts, and 
loans. This theatre would 
be the vehicle by which 
these funds would be raised. 
By offering movies that 
appeal to students, Circle 
K feels that these needs 
can be filled. 

A club spokesman esti- 
mated that 45 people were 



i hand at the 7:30 and 
9:30 showings. The audience 
Included many types of 
people as Btudents, faculty 
and general public were in 
attendance. The movie ahown 
was "You Can't Chest an 
Honest Man" featuring W.C. 
Fields and Edgar Bergen. 
The film was well received 
by the audience, 

Because of the price of 
the fllmB, Circle K will 
offer the next theatre on 
Feb. 26 with all day 
showinga. As of yet, the 
film has not been selected. 
It is hoped by Circle K 
thst this project is well 
received and supported by 
the student body.

Second in a series 



For a democratic Armed Forces 



by SP/4 Archie Llntz (ret.) 

Point 6 of the American 
Servicemen's Union program 
demands "No troops to be 
used against workers on 
atrlke." American capi- 
talists have used more vio- 
lence to smash unions thsn 
any other country's. From 
1865 to 1900 the Army was 
called out over 300 times— 
to use force against workers. 
Due to the strength of 
labor, unionism democracy wss 
able to survive under in- 
dustrial capitalism. But 
no thanks to the Army.

Health Act of 1970. 

A variety of topics will 
be discussed snd incorpor- 
ated with films and case 
studies 

Although the content of

Until 1948 racial segre- 
gation was maintained by 
assigning blscks to "US 
Colored Troop" unite having 
white officers. After the 
Civil War, Federal troops 
were withdrawn from the 
South when they may have 
protected freedmen from a 
campaign of terrorism, 
white-supremist politicsl 
domination, and lynching. 

Today we recognize the 
equalitarian potential of 
our Armed Forces. We 
oerceive the potential , 
but not the reality, of 
true equality and comrad- 
ship in srms. De facto 
racial segregation policy 
Is gone, but class aegre- 
gation ia alive. This 
segregation policy is 
carried to its unjust ex- 
treme at Ft, Leavenworth, 
where officer prisoners and 
enlisted-rank prisoners are 
segregated, officer prisoner: 
getting preferred statue 
and quarters. — The Brass 
take care of their own. 

As esrly se the Seminole - 
War (1830's) the Army has 
had experience In counter- 
guerrilla war, but that 
It has not formulate any 
effective counter-Insur- 
gency doctrine except indis- 
criminate violence Is demon- 
strated in Vietnam today. 

Pursuing s policy of 
genocide the Army counted 
943 military engsgements 
ageinst Indians from 1865 
to 1898. The Army had 
superior arms and supply 
but found it necessary to 
win many of these bsttles 
while the Indians were 
settled In winter encamp- 



Many American military 
men made their political 
careers by means of wars. 
Gen. Custer rushed West to 
zap Indisns in hopes of 
attracting support for his 
presidential embltions, 
only to get an unexpected 
haircut, Sioux style. 

Since the Army is not a 
popular arm of the greater 
American democracy it cannot 
successfully wege counter- 
insurgency warfare in Viet- 
nam or anywhere elae. It 
ia an army of ' conscripted 
men directed by sn elite 
out of touch with its own 
ranks. Ill-motivated, 
low In morale, corrupt, the 
Military Establishment 
cannot support any humanitar- 
ian or democratic committment 
to the Vietname8e people any 
more than It can win a com- 
bat victory over those Jungle 
Bolsheviks, the Viet Cong, 

Unless sertouly reformed, 
the Military will continue 
to undermine our foreign 
policy. Militarism is an 
increasing threat to our 
domestic freedom, and may 
undo our society as well aa 
societies overseas.

Fort Wayne Komets 
post winning streak 



"Never Give a Sucker 
an Even Break" *&gt;y M «* so-J" 



The Kometfl, as of Feb. 13, 
held a 5 point lead over the 
Dea Koines Oak Leafs for 
the 2nd place spot In the 
Second Division International 
Hockey League Standings. 

The K's blasted all comers 
scoring 20 goals In 3 games 
In their most recent home 
stand on Coliseum Ice. 

The action began Wed., 
Feb. 9, against the power- 
ful Muskegon Mohawks. The 
Hawks, a hardhitting crew, 
usually Intimidate their 
opposition by dishing out 
thunderous body checks. 
The Komets met them head- 
on however, and left the 
ice with an impressive 4-1 
win. 

The following Sat., Feb. 
13. the K's literally 
white washed the Columbus 
Spals 10-2. Ruaty Patenaude 
right winger, picked up a 
hat-trtck, (3 goals), 
scoring one in the second 
and twoin the third per- 
iods of'action. 

Gilbert Smith, who 
hasn't seen much Ice time 
lately, has to receive a 
pat on the back for a 
picture perfect assist to 
Al Rycroft. Smith, who had 
an opportunity to score 
himself, spotted Rycroft 
all alone at the corner of 
the goal mouth and put 
the puck right on hla 
atlck for an easy shot peat 
the Seal goal tender. Rycroft 
and Swain each tallied for 
2 goals. And Fitchner, 
Pearson and Wilson each 
scored once, 

Sunday, Feb. 13, paired 
the K's with the Flint 
Generals. Again the Komet'a 
were loaded for Bear. They 
picked up their 3rd straight 
win 6-3, in s game which 
saw plenty of action. 

One of the fineat break 
away goals scored by the K'a 
this season came while they 
were a ma» short. Al 
Rycroft was in the penalty 
box serving two minutes for 
a charging penalty. Bob 
Fitchner, a fierce fore- 
checker, stole the puck from 
a General defenseman and 
soloed In on the Flint 
goalie. Bob Peranl. Fitch 
gave Peranl a deck to the 
right corner and then 
slipped It past him on the 
left side. 

At 7:57 of the second 
period Rick Pagnutti, Komet 
defense, and Dsn Helm, 
General defense, dropped 
the gloves and exchanged 
punches. Both teams ultim- 
ately unloaded their benches 
and it looked as though 
the rest of the afternoon 



would be devoted to fist- 
Fights. However, the out- 
burst cooled quickly. 
Bernie MacNeil, left-wing, 
who has been labeled 
Komet "Policeman" — again 
proved he's no one to mess 
with. 

Over-all, the Komets 
seemed to be paseing leas 
and shooting faster. In 
prior ueeka their scoring 
suffered as they passed 
too often, ending up too 
deep f n the opposing zone 
to be effective with their 
shots. 

The next home action will 
be Feb, 27, against the 
Toledo Hornets. 

I - P netters 
register 9-16 

Indiana-Purdue's basket- 
ball squad dropped two games 
the past week, lowering 
their record to 9-16. 

On Saturday night the 
Mastodona were swamped by 
city rival Concordia, 103- 
77. The sputtering 
offense waa led by John 
Powell with 14 points. 
Trump and Haines added 13 
and 12 points, respectively. 

Tuesday night, in their 
last home game, I-PU lost 
to IU-Kokomo, 86-83. 
Trailing by aa many as 14 
points in the first half, 
the Maatodona came back to 
lead by 47-45 at the half. 
A last quarter rally jiave 
IU-Kokomo the win. Powell 
again led the Mastodon's 
scoring with 29 points, his 
best output of the season.

That W.C. Fields quote 
was probably not met to de- 
scribe intramural basket- 
ball, but it fits well. It 
waa truly a fitting theme for 
several of the games last 
week. 

The Meg's Men led off the 
evening against Draper. Many 
of the team members are 
former Luera locks. Meg 'a 
Men are a tightly knit, 
enthuaiastlc clique of guys, 
dedicated to having a good 
time, and winning. They 
have two "teams", one of 
which thlnka it 'a good and 
is, and the other which 
thinks it is and Isn't. 

The overbearingly cocky 
eecond unit began agalnat 
the accountants of Draper. 
Their sportsmanship was 
incredibly poor, hscking 
their opponents all over 
the floor and then awearing 
if caught. For the firat 
ten mlnur.ee the spectators 
were treated to an awe- 
aome display of louay basket- 
ball. 

Then the first team came 
in. The "game" became a 
farce. Draper's team, 
obvioualy in the league for 
exercise and a good time, 
got neither, as the de- 
vastating Meg's Men press 
aeldom let them cross mid- 
court. Stone-faced Steve 
Ottenweller, Moose Laughlin, 
and company felt that if 
their opponenta deaired to 
take them on, they weren't 
diahing out any sympathy 
carda. The final score- 
76-26. 

In between route, Troxel 
and Circle K squared off 
for a dandy game. Troxel 
is one of thoae steady, take- 
1t-eaay teams which alow 
everyone down to their 
level. Then It's the give- 
and-go to their talented 
leader, Dave Troxel. or the 
emooth set-shot of Kevin 
Beatty. which anchor their 
underwhelming offenae. 

Circle K la definitely 
one of the league's more 
colorful teams. Muatachoed 
Joe Kelty, sporting his 
bandana , looked 1 ike a 
little pirate who just 
stole the.Cap'n Crunch. Then 
there waa center Roger Mont- 
gomery, who looks like a 
blond Vance Hartke, only 
who can read. This night 
Circle K also played good 
baaketball (seriously) . 

Leo grad .Jim Snelling 
waa hot as a firecracker. 
His phenomenal shooting 
kept the service kids in 
the game early, and he 
wound up with about half 



their points. Jerry Hetrlck 
had his usual flair, though 
he did have an air ball free 
throw (but it had good form). 
When you're hot you're hot, 
and even Lynn Bobay hit a 
beauty of a drive. Playing 
a great game for a weak 
sister. Circle K triumphed 
In the closing minute. 

The last so-called game 
was between th" Barnyard 
Trotters and the Leo Mafia. 
The Trotters, unlike Draper 
earlier in the evening, 
dribbled, nassed, and shot 
Just like ordinary ball- 
players. Only their shots 
didn't go in. The Mafia 
stormed ahead 16-1 and led 
42-7 at the half. 

The Barnyard Trottera hit 
a little better the aecond 
half, finally falling to 
we Leo boya 86-29. The year 
began on a dismal note, 
but with aeveral encouraging 
victories, things now are 
definitely rosie. 

Hot Bhootlng Steve Bollier 
had the league 'e aecond 
highest individual perform- 
ance with 30 points. Jim 
Whltt of the Faculty-Staff 
had 38, with Louie Roy of 
Hane's Underwear with 28, 
for the season's other 
super gamea. With a running 
clock, such scoring is no 
mean taak. 

Kim Creaa kept up hla 
twenty-plus per game 
average, and steady Tom 
Sebert had hia fourth con- 
secutive double-figure 
game. But the surprising 
development waa easy-going 
Bruce Menshy, fired up by hia 
wife's presence, actually 
muscling in enough re- 
bound shots to alao wind 
up In double flgurea. 

After watching 76-26 and 
86-29 gamea, one thing la 
cryatal clear--if you're 
sucker enough to form a 
team, don't expect any 
breaks.
