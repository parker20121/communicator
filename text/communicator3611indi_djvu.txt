Bomb threats on campus make it a reality 



ThLSe days, many Americans are iuatlul and 
cowards are taking advanlage ol this Icar, 

Recently, bomb Ihreals have continued lo 
Ihrcalcn our own campus along with many 
other places around Itic counlry. 

1 find il simply amazing that people ; 

think pranks lite this are funny al a | 
lime when our counlry is in Ihc midst : 



lo SL'r^'C Iheir own purposes. 

The Ihreals a( IPFW have begi 
worldly issues closer lo home. 



D bring 



Tlierc is no doubl thai Ihe perpetra- 
tors of Ihesv crimes should be held 
responsible and prosecuted. 

Those responsible are not playing 
harmless jokes or simply playing with 
the emotions of others, 

Tliey are commillinc serious crir

Those who call in bomb threats are hinder- 
ing Ihe progress of our entire counlry in order 



idcnisof IhcMidwesI, we often don't 
consider ourselves at danger, yet 
some think il is funny lo jeopardize 
our notion ol safely. In many ways. 
Ihey are doing jusi ihe opposite. 

For one. slndonls and facully 
here are probablv more aware of Ihe 
danger as a result ol Ihe false Ihreals. 

I Many have come lo realize thai 

&gt;....-.....; in Fort WajTic. 

Our false serue of security has tieen elimi- 
nated and has been replaced with reality. 

Also as a result of these Ihreals, 1 personally 
feel more safe. tCnowing that officials are not 
taking Ihe Ihreals lightly is comforting lo me. 
Although being evacuated from class is an 
inconvenience, il is definitely bcller lo be safe 
than sorry in silualions like Inese. 

I am proud of Ihc wav officials have handled 



the Ihreals on campus and am grateful lo them 

Whether il is a small preschool or a large 
university, school is a place where everyone 
should feel safe. 

Officials al IPFW arc working to ensure thai 
we do. 

A reward is being offered to help identify 
and prosecute those involved. 

I am happy lo know thai steps are being 
taken toeliminale Ihese Ihreals. 

Those who arc responsible have a very sick 
sense of humor. 

Anyone who would lake advanlage of inno- 
cent citizens during a lime of war deserves lo 
be punished. 

How can our nation gel back lo normal 
when some of our otvn citizens threaten our 
safely while ivc simply sil in class?

Respect, honor and 
the lack thereof 



Here al IPFW, we arc a university of higher 
IcaiTiing. Staffing this fine institution are many 
highly-qualified inclividuals who ^v,1^l to help 
other people learn. People become teachers 
because they enjoy helping 
other people learn new 
Ihings, not because they 
want lo wreak havoc on 
their students, 

1 have heard horror 
stories about students al 
IPFW yelling at Iheir pro- 
fessors because the Ihcy 
didn't understand the sub- 
ject matter, I was told of a 
student in a Spanish class 
who continually corrected 
her professor because they 
spoke different dialects of 
Ihe Spanish language. 

I caruiol accept any student publicly tearing 
down his professor. A professor should always be 
given the utmost respect in ihc classroom. Never 
should a professor be forced to endure public per- 
secution for doing his job. 

If you have a problem with a professor, 
whether il be a personal problem, a problem with 
his leaching style or the exams being too difficult, 
do not, under any circumstances, bring up your 
personal dl'approval of the professor in front of 
the class. Go to the professor during his office 
hours and lalk Ihrough Ihc disagreements like civi- 
lized adulls. 

Your professors have earned a degree, many 
having the highest degree in Iheir field, and most 
students do not even possess a bachelor's degree. 
If, for no other rc.ison, respect your professors 
because they have earned a higher degree Ihan the 
one you may currently possess. 

The current trends of society and the media 
have taught us not lo treat our elders as those who 
are older and wiser than we arc. We are taught that 
we are always correct, even if wc are svrong. 
Sociely no longer places acceptance in the idea that 
the yoiuigcr generation should rcspecl older gener- 
ations. Society says that older generations are out 
of touch wilh reality and that Ihe younger genera- 
tion Ls the only generation with correct answers. 

All loo often, I think that students do not give 
honor to whom honor is due. Those who have 
earned the right to l-e called professor or doctor 
deserve lo be treated like people who have paid 
their dues. 

To those of you who think your professors arc 
your equab, you had better think again. Your pro- 
fessors are far superior to you, and may always be 
superior lo you. 

When you publicly tear down a professor, you 
are saying lo the professor and your fellow stu- 
dents that you do nol respect the professor. You are 
claiming that you arc better than, or at least equal 
to, your professor 

Nothing could tie further from the truth. 
When you tear down your professors, you are 
showing everyone that you have no respect for 
anybody In general, people don't like other people 
who tike to tear people down. 

If you ivant to achieve greatness in li/c, rcspecl 
those who have paid their dues and deserve lo be 
respected, even if you do not agree wilh them.

Summer Bridge program guides students 



y Kenneth Childer 

Multicultural Services provides many 
services to IPFW sludenls. Originally 
from Wilkes Bame. P.i . and currently 

working on her dissertation iri adult edu- 
cation with a minor in history, Chris 
Patterson is also the director of 
Multicultural Services. 

One of Ihc office's flagship efforts of 
which Patterson is particularly proud is 
Ihe Summer Bridge Program. 

According lo Patterson, Ihc program 
targets stud enLs from low socio-econom- 
ic and diverse backgrounds, "kids who 
are generally not able lo go to college, 
basically," and prepares Ihcm to go to 
college and be successful. 

During the summer. Bridge students 
live in cc&gt;lli&gt;ge-lumishcd housing, allcnd 
workshops lo develop the social skills 
needed lor success in college and also 
earn six college credits, 

"Many ol Ihe kids arc i 
backgrounds which did 
Ihcm socially or culturally 
lege," Patterson said, "It is &gt;' 
al Doot camp, so to speak." 

Closely allied to the Dridge program is 
SID, or Students in Danger. .1 program in 
which all Dridge students must partici- 
pate. 

Oilier students may also parlicipate in 
SID, SID is an early intervention pro- 
gram designed lo address problems slu- 
denl participants might be having. One 
special locus involves bringing in profes- 
sors 10 help students inonilor their 
progri-ss. PatliT^on said thai Ihe hands- 



mi ng from 

i go lo col- 
ed Ilea lion- 



nportant lo the si 
ol the sludenls her area supports. 

"It doesn't guarontce we'll be success- 
ful 100 percent of the lime, but we'n; 
guanintwd nol lo be successful if we 
don'l do anything.' 

How successful is Summer Bridge? 
Mulhculliiral Services and Ihe univcrruly 
monitor its progress carefully- 
According to Patterson, the program 
'is outside ol the ballpark* in terms ol iLs 
success, "since manv ol those participat- 
ing would nol even have been provision- 
ally admissible." 

The recent report on the program 
showed that 24 students enrolled in Ihe 
Summer Bridge term. 

Ol those, 31 students were successlul 
in completing the program and 17 ol 
those 21 enrolled in classes during Ihe 
Fall 2001 term. 

Another more intangible beneht ol the 
program that Patterson identified is the 
way it fosters both actual diversity and a 
knowledge of diversity on campus. 

"Summer Bridge probably constilutes 
one Ihinl of the minority sludenls who 
start al IPFW in the fall. 'She said. 

"Summer Bridge is nol just lor minor- 
ity sludenls-it's based on income, so it 
culs across racial lines." 

This fact provides an opportunity for 
a lesson in diversity education. 
According lo Pattcfson, apprmimately 
14 percent of Bridge participants are 
white, "giving Ihcm a chance to see what 
it's like to be a minority, because It's a 
reversal of roles," 

Over the vears. the program has had a 



lair amounl ol success in retaining slu- 
denls. too 

Figures from Sep temljer show that, ol 
the 117 students ivho have parlicipaled 
in the Summer Bridge program to date. 
about 49 percent are still attending IPFW 
or another college, while three percent 
have graduated. 

This IS in line with United Slates aver- 
ages as a whole, which show that about 
hall ol all voung people in the Unilcd 
Stales attend some higher-learning insti- 

Pallerson said thai, in this day and 
age, education is becoming more and 
men; impoilanl. nol just lor its practical 
benefits, but bccau.sc sociely is putting 
more ol an emphasis on crcclentiab, 

"Before you could |ust cook, but now 
you have to have a degree to show you 
can cook," she said. The solution, accord- 
ing to Patterson, is to over-prepare. 

For ciample. by getting a bachelor's 
degree if one feels an associate's is need- 
ed. 

"We .ire credenliallne ourselves to the 
point Ihat we have to t&gt;c more focused 
and not become complacent."

The symptoms for being an "al-nsk"

Some of Ihe symptoms include poor

IPFW sets sights on the Big Dance 



Hy Adam Spieth, Sporl.s Editor 

IPFW is awaiting a decision from the NCAA 
Division 1 Board olDirectors that could change 
a current rule thai affects the IPFW basketball 



Currently, schools making the 
Division I would have lo wait eight years 
before they arc able to become eligible as a con- 
ference's automatic qualifier for the NCAA 
Basketball Tournament. 

However, there is an cvceplion lo Ihis rule 



lor which IPFW may equality 

Because IPFW was m the process of reclasst- 
lying to Division 1 by April 27, 2000, Ihe school 
may be eligible lor tournament play and ton- 
Icrence berth by Ihe 2004-05 season, or perhaps 

This aUo makes IPFW a much more attrac- 
tive school in its quest lor membership in a 
Division I conference, IPFW is hoping lo be 
admilled into the Mid-Con which could mean 
Ihc opportunity lor a trip lo the Big Dance
