AT INDIAIIA-PURDUE TUESDAY— Purdue University President, 
Dr. Arthur Hansen is pictured being interviewed by 
Communicator reporter, Liz Schevtchuk, during his recent 
visit to the campus. He discussed such issues as student 
dissent, 

Purdue prexy speaks on 
campus issues at lU-PU 



In a speech at Indiana- 
Purdue on Tues., Sept. 21, Dr. 
Arthur Hansen, President of 
Purdue University stated that 
his primary concern in his po- 
sition focuses on the question 
of "What the mission of the 
university should be." 

"Society faces very cri- 
tical problems in the latter 
part of this century," he 
n^ted. "What role does the 
University play in solvincr' 
these?" 

"Problerrs involve the im- 
pact of techno] OFy upon the 
system," Pres. Hansen remark- 
ed. The University "sets 
back, views society" and yet 
"must serve in an immediate 
sense." The university's 
service is of a two-fold 
manner. As a main campus, 
Purdue at Lafayette had a 
different mef-dd of service 
than the reerional campuses. 

As Dr. hansen explained, 
"The regional campus serves 
rep-ion'^i needs, it's not as 
cloba] in outlook. Accord- 
"inr to Dr. Hansen, "There are 
soFe things the campus at 
Lafayette ir.&gt;.^st be doin'-, and 
some things the regional cam- 
puses must be doinr." The 
profession of hipher educa- 
tion demands innovative pet- 
hods. A repional campus can 
lead , play an important role 
as a "cuttinp edre" , locking 
forward to different method 
of operation. 

Amonp other concepts de- 
sired are in the woi^s of 
Dr. Hansen, "More change, 
more innovation. Students 
and faculty can take -part in 



shaping these. I want to see 
intelljp-ent stijyiO ation, re- 
sponse and Eharinp of burdens. '' 

The Purdue head sees vio- 
lence on campuses tapering off, 
a condition which brings him 
feelings of relief. However, 
he expressed the concern that 
he would "hate to see us swing 
back to apathy, " 

"Students strive for some- 
thing to clinp to," he stat- 
ed. "Dissent is part of this." 
Certain issues attract stu- 
dent support, but frequently, 
These issues tend to fade with 
time. " 

"I'm therefore fearful of 
a Ev;in5- back to apathy. There 
is a place for real, honest 
dissent in a scholarly, ana- 
lytical approach." - 

Discijssinf^ the question of 
autonom-. for regional campus- 
es, Dr. Hansen found that 
"The pros and cons of autonomy 
are difficult to assess." As 
a rei^irnal campus becomes 
autonoiEous, a sense of pride 
develops among the faculty. 
In such a case, Dr. Hansen 
warned, the repional campus 
must be aware of certain dang- 
ers. 

"It must be concerned with 
the overall effect, especial- 
ly in relation to the best 
interest of the stucients." 
Still, "Some autonomy would 
be a wise thinp." 

Known for his good relati on- 
ship with the student body 
while President of Georgia Tech. 
Dr. Hansen disclaimed the no- 
tion that he employed specific 
method of achievinp rapport.

Revolutionaries' creed 



When in the course of human 
events, it becomes necessary 
for one people to dissolve the 
political bands which have 
connected then with another, 
and to assume amonf the pow- 
ers of the earth, the separ- 
ate aftd equal station to which 
the Laws of Nature and of Na- 
ture's God entitle them, a 
decent respect to the opinions 
of manVind requires that they 
should declare the causes that 
impel them to the separation. 
V/e hold these truths to be 
self-evidert, that all men 
are created equal, that they 
&lt;ire endowed by their Creator 
with certain unalienable 
Rie^hts, that amonp these are 
Life, Libert;.' and the pur- 
suit of Happiness. That to 
secure these rights. Govern- 
ments are instituted amon^ 
^■^en, deriving the^r just 
powers from the consent of 
the p-overned. That whenever 
any form of Government becomes 
destructive of these ends, ii 
is the Eight of the People 



to alter or abolish it, and 

to institute new Government, 
layinp its foundation on 
such principles "^nd, orp-aniz- 
inp its powers in such form, 
as to them shall seTm most 
likely to affect their safety 
and Happiness. Prudence, in- 
deed, will dictate that Gov- 
ernments lono- established 
should not be chanEred for 
liFht and transient causes; 
and accordinply rail experi- 
ence hath snewn, that mankind 
are more dis:oseG to suijer, 
while evils are suffcrable, 
than to rii-nt themselves by 
abolishinF tbe forms to 
which they are accustomea. 
But when a lonp- trpin of a- 
buses and apurpations, pur- 
suing invariable t"ie same 
Object, evinces a desipTi to 
reduce them under absolute 
Despotism, it is their riirht 
it is their duty, to throw 
off such Government, and to 
provide new pxiards for their 
future security....

Free parking- can you pay price? 



Now that the initial shock 
has worn off, perhaps ii would 
be rood to take a closer look 
at some of the factors involv- 
ed in the (not so) Free Park- 
inpi-'^'Ot controversy. 

fisuny individuals were tic- 
keted, many more were anpered 
b,v the situation last week. 
Some were even stirred up 
enouph to try and find a solu- 
tion. 

The sol'ition seekers ap- 
proached the problem from var- 
ious perspectives, and some 
temporar;/ solutions were 
found . 

Dr. Ulmer talked Police 
Chief Don Si^el into calling 
a moratoriuir. on the issuance 
of tickets until some . other 
place to park could be lo- 
cated. Then permission was 
granted to park alonpside the 
soccer field by the horseshow 
track. 

This solution served the 
purpose until the first rain 
turned the new parkinp^ spaces 
into a swajnp. Many irotorists 
were bopcred down in the muck, 
and many more shoes and cloth- 
ing; items were ruined. 

Other solution seekers at- 
tempted to question whether 
parkinp- should be banned at 
al] alonp: the riverbanks. 
This proup ran head-on into 
the Izaak Walton League and 
Karen Gripes, their spokes- 
woman. 

Accusations aprainst IMI 
are typified by the alle^^a- 
t:on that they cared more for 
a tree than for a human life. 

IWI ' s reply made it clear 



that their prime motivaxion 
was the preservation of hu- 
man life throu"h their efforts 
to keep nature in balance. 
They try to remind us that, 
as organisms, we are a link 
in the chain *of life, anc by 
breaking that chain we are 
com! ittinp- suicide. 

Besides the ecolorical 
arprument, there- was also a 
lepa] arrument involved, 
[■.any students were anpered 
at the police for havinp is- 
sued the tickets. 

I personally talked at 
lenrth with one of th*^ offic- 
ers v7ho explained that the 
property in question is city 
property, that the road is 
a public road, that the area 
is clearly marked, and that 
they had respo.'ded to a tele- 
phone coirplaint . 

Although a temporary solu- 
tion has been found, it is 
clearly inadequate. The sit- 
uation will continue unless 
someone takes the time to 
make an in-depth study and 
submits a workable nlan to 
the proper officials. 

Perhaps a study group com- 
posed of students and faculty 
members in coordination with 
a staff representative from 
the appropriate department 
could form a committee to 
research the situation. 

it is clear that building 
plans call for movement of the 
cajnpus' center away from the 
parkinf lot, thus makinp the 
free lot further and further 
away from tfie school. 

The current lot is too 



small, the overriow area is 
in terrible condition, cars 
are rerularly broken into 
and burglarized, and with 
the lot unlirhted most nir-hts, 
it seems only a matter of 
time before we suffer an act 
of violer.ce. 

i^ome students feel that 
the adminirtretion is tryinrt 
to force the frep lot PRrkers 
to buy paid r'iirkinr- stickers 
so as to justify the rpcent 
expansion of the parkinr lots. 
They also feel th^t the move 
will fail since most students 
who park -^n the free lot do 
so from necessit.v and not de- 
sire. 

It is this writer's feelinps 
that while the result may be 
as described, the motivation 
behind such an action is not 
a de-humanizinp", malicious, 
insensitivity; the motivation 
could well be a sincere attempt 
to satisfy all the needs (e.-^. 
trustees, students etc.), 
without being sufficiently a- 
ware of all those needs. 

The task is to provide a 
vehicle by which all the needs 
cp-n be defined, all the al- 
ternatives can be determined, 
and all the necessary leverap-e 
can be developed to effect 
implementation of the select- 
ed alternatives. 

Initial research indicates 
that there are some alternatives 
which could be considered. 
For exar.ple, in l*;!^? a plan- 
ning committee decided not to 
■apply for federal funds to 
help build the parkinp- lot,

Is Superstar sacrilegious? 



Havine- been in a rather 
conspicuous "osition with re- 
gards to Superstar, that of 
Convocations Chairman, I un- 
dertook a relatively thorouph 
examination of Superstar to 
tieterinine whether or not I 
felt it was sacrileFicus. 
By listening to the record, 
studylnfT the words, attending 
the performance, discussinp: 
Superstar with cast members, 
and listeninr to the comirents 
of others, little doubt was 
left in my mind that Super- 
star was in fact sacrileg- 
ious. 

It is rry contention that 
Superstar promotes "humanism," 
as opposed to Christianity. 
"Humanism," as I am usinp it, 
means the worshir of a human 
beintr; in thiF caee, a man 
nsmpd Jesus. Jesus Christ is 
reduced to a remarkable mEin v;ho 
united Himself to God and be- 
came God in that sense. 

My contention, to my own 
surprise, is generally ac- 
certed. I could find no 
one to rise to challenge it. 
Jeff Gibson discussed the 
theolop-y of Superstar at the 
rap session held on the day 
of the performance. I quote 
last week's Communicator : 
"He said that it is an examin- 
ation of the traditional be- 
lief of Christ with the con- 
clusion that Jesus was just 
an extrr^ordinary man." Jeff 
and I seldom airree, but that 
was a marvelous wrap-up of 
Superstar. 

Jeff, and members of the 
cast, would probably defend 
"humanism" as an honorable 
relii^ion in itself. It is 
not my purpose to disagree 
here. But I do contend 
"humanism" and Christianity 
are mutually exclusive. 

In "humanism" Christ is an 
"extraordinary man" whose 
deeds v.'ere noble and ^iust. 
He is a human example for us 
to strive for. In Christian- 
ity Jesus Christ is the only 
Son of God, part of the Holy 
Trinity, whom God the Father 
sent down to- earth, as a per- 
fect man, to die at the hands 
of men to atone for the sins 
of men, and to arise again in 
three days with the promise 
of f7T- ce and eternal life for 
all who would accept Him. 
Christ set a perfect example 
for fan, but the purpose of 
His cominr down to earth was 
not to do deeds but to suffer 
crucifixion at the hands of 
sinners so that we miprht have 
the hope of eternal life. 
One may not acree with this 
interpretation, but it is the 
traditional Christian belief, 
rep-ardless of denomination. 

The Reverend Billy Graham 
has criticized Jesus Christ 
Superstar for omitting the 

September 24, 1971 



resurrection, the very basis 
of Christianity. Billy Barnes, 
who played Christ at the per- 
formance here and, so far as 
I could determine, was the 
only cast member who profess- 
ed anything resemblinp: Christ- 
ianity, said over radio that 
he doubted whether Christ ev- 
er arose. He claimed that 
such a fact was unimportant, 
that what mattered was Christ's 
life here on earth. 

Catholicism, seldom align- 
ed with Bil'iy GrahaiJ:, had 
hiFtorically condemned "human- 
ism" and has feared its eros- 
ion of the Christian base. 
In 451 A.D., the Council of 
Ephesus approved the anathe- 
mas of St. Cyril, v/hich round- 
ly condemned "humanism." The 
Fifth Anathema read: 

"If any one dares to say 
that the Anointed One is 
an inspired man and not 
rather that he is really 
God, as being the One Son 
by His Divine Mature, for- 
asmuch as the Word was 
made flesh, and like us 
shared blood and flesh, 
let his be anathema (i.e. 
damned or excommunicated)." 
"Damned" is a pretty strong 
word, not thrown around loose- 
ly by Christians. Superstar 
is sacrilegious because it 
promotes "humanism, " which 
directly undermines the Christ- 
ian religion of which Jesus 
Christ is the base. Steve 
Porter wrote an article on 
Superstar for this paper last 
week. He wrote; "But even 
you Birchers, who were pro- 
bably emotionally involved in 
the rock-orera, must admit the 
whole show had a pood beat." 
Outside of an objection to 
combining all those who dis- 
agree with Steve Porter under 
the hate word "Birchers," I 
will freely admit that the 
show had a great beat. And, 
if one can separate the pagan 
"humanism" from the rest of 
the rock-opera, one can get 
emotionally involved and get 
a moving portrayal of Christ. 

The point, however, remains 
that i^^perstar, as beautiful 
emd inspiring as its music may 
be, promotes "humanism. " Un- 
less a Christian is aware of 
its 'pitfalls, Superstar can 
be an undermining influence 
upon his faith.

Men need God because their 
precarious and contingent 
lives can find final signifi- 
cance only in His almighty 
and eternal purposes, and be- 
cause their fragmentary selv- 
es must find their ultimate 
center only in His transcen- 
dent love. If the meaning of 
men's lives is centered sole- 
ly in their own achievements, 
these too are vulnerable to 
the twists and turns of his- 
tory, and their lives will al- 
ways teetei- on the abyss of 
pointlessness and inertia. 
And if men's ultimate loyal- 
ty is centered on themselves, 
then the effect of their 
lives on others around them 
will be destructive of that 
community on which all depend. 
Only in God is there an ulti- 
mate lovalty that does not 
breed injustice and cruelty, 
and a meaning from which no- 
thing in heaven or on earth 
can separate us.

Attention basketball players! 

There will be a meeting for students interested 
in playing intercollegiate basketball on Friday, 
September 24 at 5:30 p.m. in Room 178, 



Ruckebhaus speaks: 



Fbllution problem is complex 



AccordinfT to Williair Ruck- 
elshaus, the head of the Sh- 
vironmental Protection Apency, 
the problem of pollution is 
extremely complex, opeaking 
at a rublic luncheon held Fri- 
day, Sept. 17 at the Fort 
Wayne Chamber of Commerce, 
Ruckelshaus answered questions 
from the floor and briefly 
discussed the difficulties 
facing the EPA. 

One of the obstacles which 
must be surmounted comes from 
the differences of opinion 
concerning the most effective 
solutions for each pollution 
problem. As Ruckelshaus ad- 
mitted,' "l^obody aprrees on 
what works ajid what doesn't." 

The phosphate debate is 
just one example of the num- 
erous situations with which 
the EPA must deal. Because 
phosphate has the detrimen- 
tal effect of hastening the 
eutrophication process of the 
water into which it is empti- 
ed , phosphate determents have 
met strong criticism from 
environmentalists. 

Ifet, upon analysis by the 
Surgeon General's staff, 
some of the substitutes for 
phosphate detergents have 
been found to be caustic and 
hence dangerous to human safe- 
ty. For this reason, some 
authorities have urged con- 
sumers to continue in the use 
of the phosphate-based clean- 
ing apents. 

Meanwhile, detere^ent manu- 
facturers remain at work de- 
veloping new phosphate free 
products in the hope that a 
permissible product is man- 
ufactured. 

"Reforms are beinp: offered 
all the time," Ruckels'-aus 
stated, "but the fact that a 
product must clear stringent 
tests before it is marketed 
means a delay in the release 
of potential prot^ncts. 

In addition to use of non-

phosphate cleaners, Ruckel- 
shaus explained, phosphate 
damap-es can be controlled by 
adapting water treatment 
plants for phosphate removal. 
Throught a process of instal- 
ling facilities at a treatment 
plant, up to 98% of phosphate 
can be removed from receiving 
waters. 

Other methods of phosphate 
control are also under study. 
Until a permanent solution is 
made feasible , however, Ruck- 
elshaus advocated cateful 
consideration of all aspects 
of the phosphate dilemma. 

"Before you ban phosphates," 
he cautioned, "make sure you 
know what you are doing." 

Questioned whether he and 
the EPA receive full President- 
ial support, Ruckelshaus un- 
hesitatingly answered with an 
emphatic "yes! " Complications 
frequently arise from conflict 
with other governemnt agenci- 
es, he revealed afterwards, 
but due to its lower to en- 
force environmental standards, 
the EPA c£n over-rule other 
agencies which fail to meet 
regulations. 

Disputes likewise result 
from actions taken by the EPA 
against members of private in- 
dustry. Asked to coirirent on 
a suit filed against the EPA 
by Indiana and Michigan Elec- 
tric Company, Ruckelshaus 
quipped, "They'll just have 
to get in line and wait their 
turn like everybody else!" 
Several other companies have 
previously initiated court pro- 
ceedings against the EPA. 

With the full status of a 
federal agency, the ETA works - 
in conjunction with state ag- 



encies whenever necessary and 

attempts to further state com- 
pliance with federal demands. 
Indiana, for instance, has 
not put forth the complete 
environmental quality pro- 
gram desired from the fed- 
eral level. 

In the words of Ruckelshaus, 
the states are often "overwhftl- 
med by national demands." let, 
nationally, the United States 
must coordinate pollution a- 
bateirent efforts to increase 
environmental prOFiress. 

Discussing this concert fur- 
ther, Ruckplshaus remarked, 
"As the most hirhly industrial- 
ized nation, the United States 
must be a leader. There is an 
^obligation to the rest of the 
world to insure that scienti- 
fic micht and industrial might 
are turned to preservinr the 
planet." 

Later in the afternoon at 
the dedication of the City- 
County Building, Ruckelshaus 
concluded his appearances in 
Fort Wayne with the following 
analysis of the relationship 
of the city to the total en- 
vironment : "The environment 
of a city is a concern which 
all of us should share. 
V/here a man lives is so ter- 
ribly important to what he 
becomes. The city environ- 
ment must be a place vfhere 
the human spirit can be 
lifted."

continued 
even though it was later 
decided that fees would be 
renuired, since state funds 
were not available. 

Perhaps a reevaluation of 
the situation could be made. 
Chancellor Broyles, who was 
a member of the 1969 commit- 
tee would be able to provide 
valuable insir-ht as to the 
motivation for the decision 
not to request federril fund- 
intr. 

Another interestinp: point 
worth considering is the fact 
that lU-PU Regional owns a 
rather larpre piece of land 
across the road which is 
currently not beinr used, 
and it is in the direction of 
campus p^rowth. 

Perhaps if a study comjrittee 
were in force, some cf this 
land could be developed into 
additional free lot spaces. 

The final consideration is 
•■he nuestion: "Is it fair to 
provide f-ree lot spaces to 
some, while others have to 
pay': " 

The other side of the 
nuestion is "Is it fair to 
deny an erucation to those 
unable i"o snueeze an extra 
itf^O.OO out of their budret?" 

Both nuestions are rhe- 
torical ; both impose un- 
fair restrictions on the type 
of answer that can be riven. 
More important Questions 
are. Can we afford to crintinue 
providing short term answers 
to long term problems? 

Can we really claiir^ to be 
concerned about probleips un- 
less we are concerned erourh 
to do sorrethinr about them? 

And, can we hope to do 
something about the uroblems 
unless we take the time to 
evaluate the problem from 
all sides? 

What do the students 
need? VJbat c^n the uni- 



versity proTide? What re- 
sources are available? * 

The protlec is complex, 
and it has entertained cafe- 
teria radicals for ruite a 
number of semesters; but, it 
is a serious probler. that 
needs an intelligent solution, 
and needs it badly. 

This year enrollment is up 
7.9/" at lU alone! Each semes- 
ter the need increases. By 
1975. we will probably be a 
full-fledced independent uni- 
versity and rrowinc even more 
rapidly. 

If we don't resolve to seek 
real answers to real problems, 
by realistic tactics, we de- 
serve what we pet. 

It is time to take the is- 
sue from the cafeteria table, 
to the dr-'ftinr table, then 
on to the negotiations table.

ill of Rights in limbo 



Hark Pranke^ 
^7 Student Body 
President 



To those wjio sre not new 
to this campus, the Bill of 
Student Rights and Responsi- 
bilities bas be'=n a poal for 
quite some time now. For 
those who are freshmen or 
otherwise in their first 
year here, a brief history 
of the Bill will prove ben- 
eficial. 

Although the idea of a 
student bill of rights has 
been around -for many years, 
no progress was made until 
this last year, Scott 
Gillie, past Student Body 
President, formulated and 
authored the present doc- 
ument, which is in its 
fourth revision. 

The Bill itself is ele- 
ven papres long, five of 
which are operational 
guidelines and procedures. 
It deals with areas such 
ar ri"-hts of privacy, 
."^sembly, and protest, 
n-eanizations, publica- 
tions, government, and 
student records. 

Much of the Bill re- 
iterates rights of stu- -. ■ 
dents already recognized :■ -■ 
and granted, either ex- 
plicitly or implicitly. 
The basic rights affirmed 
in it have been referenced 
by a much higher and much 
piore sacred Bill of Rights. 

As to the present status 
of the Bill, a few observa- 
tions. 

1) Because of our dicho- 
tomous structure, the Bill 
must ne approved by both 
'the Indiana and the Purdue 
Board of Trustees. Both 
boards have delegated to 
th'^ir respective faculty 
sena'PF the responsibilities 
foT ■ jintnending student 
cnd'^s of conduct. There- 
l"ore, the Pill must pass 
both faculty senates on this 
campus, and, necessarily, 
in identical form with iden- 
tical vrc^bulr^77'. Wow, 
with Revision #4 h'-^vinf 
pasF?d the Student Senate 
ar.d with sub-revision B of 
of Revision #4 in committee 
ir.' thp Purdue Senate, to 
which it has been advised 



to undertake further revision 
so as not to complicate 
matters, one must wonder 
whether there will ever 
appear any semblance of 
sanity at lU-PU Fort Wayne, 

2) After onerous at- 
tempts at studying the Bill 
including the holding of 
open hearings, the Student 
Affairs Committee of the 
Indiana Senate reported the 
Bill to senate floor, where 
its grammatical content was 
studied in great depth, and 
where each clause and phrase 
was meticulously scrutinized 
for what it may or may not 
infer. But because the Sen- 
ate had "important" matters 
for it to concern itself 
with, and as it should not 
be troubled with a Bill of 
Student Rights and Respon- 
sibilities, an opinion I 
readily subscribe to though. 
for very different reasons, 
the Bill was referred back 
to committee; £ind, in a 
moment of divine revelation, 
it war thought that the com- 
mittee should hold open 
hearings so the mechanics of 
the Bill could be properly 
dealt with, 

3) It takes no expert 
logician to induce that 
there is a concerted effort 
by numerous faculty members 
on this campus to prevent 
the approval and implemen- 
ta-cion of the Sill, I 
suggest the following rea- 
sons for such action: a) 
The fact that the Bill ia 
not a code of conduct, per 
se, but is a guarantee of 
basic rights of students 

as American citizens and 
as members of the academic 
community, b) The fact 
that the Bill would pre- 
lude to a great extent 
the role of faculty patern- 
alism, a role implying a 
disciplinary as well as 
protective function, c) 
The fact that the Bill 
will reaffirm the student 
as the soul of the uni- 
versity and as the only 
motivation for our educa- 
tional system.

OpenJnr rip-ht of IIT's 
presentation You ' re A Good 
J^an Charlie Brown went so 
well that -L had to return on 
Saturday nipht to convince 
myself thnt there wnsn t oust 
an openinF' nipht (flow sur- 
roundinr' the first rerfor- 
mance. 

T aril happy to say that the 
second perforinanee was Just 
as pleasing and excitintr as 
the first. The cast has a 
, solid piece of work which. ■ 
they- are constantly improv- 
inff upon, and their devotion 
shows in their performance. 

There were a couple of 
moments when thinfrs slowed 
down a bit, but I find dif- 
ficulty in criticizinr when 
I mist Rrasp for the small 
things to voint out jmrer- 
fections, 

I would rather describe 
the play this way: On Fri- 
day I sat with a very difrni- 
fied and hifrhly respected 
rsycholopist v/hom I have 
rarely seen smile. By the 
second soncr, he was lauphinp: 
as only a person who has mo- 
mentarily recaptured his 
childhood can laurrh. 

The next nirht I sat with 
a little charmer ramed Carol 
("I'm not in kinderirarten, 
I'm in the first rrade!") 
who shared her candy with me 
(the ones she bit into and 
didn't like). 

She proved ap;ain that in 
laughter one finds the mag- 
ic that transcends one's 
years and remakes the v/crld. 



"She was completely caurht up 
in the play, and paid atten- 
tion ri^ht throuc-h to the 
VTy end. Sometimes Fbe 
lauE-hed louder than I did. 

With these two extrir.e 
examples, I hope the ran^ic 
of Cherlie Brown j s explain- 
ed. In the play's characters 
we sometimes unexpectedly 
see ourselves, but never in 
despair. Even durinr Char- 
lie's darkest moments there 
is somethinp- to clinr to, 
some litile bit of hope. 

As Charlie says, "t'iaybe 
we don't have a million to 
one chance of winning the 
ball pame — but I'll bet we 
have a billion to one chance! 

If you have a chance, be 
sure to come out to see the 
play this weekend. Come ear- 
ly, thouph, as the word had 
gotten out by the second per- 
formance last weekend and the 
auditorium was filled to cap- 
acity. 

Kany were turned away at 
the door, rruch to their' re- 
Rret, althouFh five beautiful 
yoiinF ladies were willinr to 
endure the discomfort of sit- 
ting on the floor down frort. 
They felt it was well worth 
the trouble, however, and 
Carol and I didn't mind eith- 
er. They broupht the candy.

teriorating treisha and a Tok- 
yo dilettante. "

Trouble with 
connections? 



For all science oriented 
students who are having trou- 
ble connecting with your 
courses the following is writ- 
ten. It could be that you 
don ' t know one of the funda- 
mental laws of the universe. 

- fiurphy's law (or Finnagle's 
fudge factor if are from Ire- 
land) is known to all scien- 
tists and engineers. The 
student without knowledge of 
this law is difinitely handi- 
capped. It is as follows: 

In any field of scientific 
endeavor anythinp' that can go 
wrong, will go wrong. 

All constants should be 
treated as variables, because 
they probably are. 

Decimal points will always 
be misplaced. 

Parts of an equation that 
are calculated correctly will 
be the source of the error. 

Fractions are always in- 
advertently inverted. 

i^ny object cut to a speci- 
fied length will be too short. 

A triple checked calcula- 
tion for a demonstration will 
always be in error at the 
last minute. 

Left to themselves, things 
always go from bad to worse. 

Nature always sides with 
the hidden flaw. 

If everything seems to be 
going wel] , you have obvious- 
ly overlooked something. 

A situation viewed in its 
proper light is always worse 
than it first seemed. 

If there is a possibility 
of several things going 
wrong the one that will go 
wrong is the one that does 
the most damage. 

A dropped object will al- 
ways land when it will do the 
most damage^ (Known as the 
law of selective gravitation. )

^ many Rep-ional students

'herever there was a pntch of f^ra.

the teams practisinp were a staff team, a 
'distaff team, a r.q;'cho!lopy team, and ouite a fev

Our team, the Psycholory team, was out there passi.

it was their f:rst workout (that was one of the Excuses 
hey gave us), they felt they would rather not. The Bea- 
rs accepted our challenpie, but when we arrived w^ found 
that they had accepted in the name of their auxilinry 
'men's team. It seemed that their shortest p^iy v/as iS'3' 

their lightest man weighed ?50 lbs.. Everything weht^ 
'ell, and we had a good scrimmap-e. In fact, on our very 
first play, we had to stop for a few moments to pry a 
forearm out of our premiere Halfback's windpipe. Later, 
one of nur defensive backs hit a ba] 1 carrier rirht in 
'the thumb with his eye. If his v/ife, or RirJfrier.d
