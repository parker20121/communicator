Office of Financial Aids solves money problems 

ir lack of money stands between vau rarrv 3 invi iniDraci ntn a ,.■.„,. &gt;(,.. .»_ ._. _. P 



If lack of money stands between you 
and the completion of your college ed- 
ucation, there may be help available. 

The Office of Financial Aids in Room 
104 is the place to go if you need this 
kind of help — many students do. Schol- 
astic ability, financial need or both de- 
termine eligibility. 

If you're facing a money problem for 
next year, pick up your application at 
the Scholarship Office in January or 
February and return it no later than 
April I for I.U. students and March I 
for P.U. students. 

Types of aid available include schol- 
arships, grants, loans and employment. 
Money comes from many sources such 
as the Universities, individuals, cor- 
porations, foundations, clubs, religious 
and fraternal organiiations and Federal 
and State governments. 

In general, aid falls into the follow- 
ing categories: 
Gift Aid— 

(I) Scholarships are based on aca- 
demic achievement and college poten- 
tial. The amount of the scholarship is 
determined on the basis of the students' 
financial need except where the amount 
is set and generally known. 

(I) Grants- in-aid are for students 
who need money to slay in school but 
do not meet high scholastic standards, 
with funds coming mainly from the U.S. 
Educational Opportunity Grant Pro- 

(3) Awards are given to children of 
disabled or deceased veterans. 

Loans— 

(1) Long-term loans are granted to 
students whose needs are too great to 
be covered with gift-aid funds alone. 
These loans usually do not bear inter- 
est while the student is in school. They

payment period in the five to ten years 
aft?r the student leaves school. The 
main source of these type funds are 
through the National Defense Student 
Loan and the Federally Insured Student 
Loan. 



(2) Short-term loans are made h 
small amounts to cover emergencies.

As I see it 

by Mark Souder 

Jeff Gibson ^8 ancestors 

Few students are aware of the revolu- 
tionary heritage of our draft'resistine 
brother, iell Gibson. One can easily 
picture the rollowing ancestors... 

In ITS6 Daniel Shay led a rebellion 
of veterans. As violence increased, 
Governor Bowdoin called up the mili- 

A young philosopher, Jim Gibson, 
was outraged. Gibson claimed it was 
immoral (or the Governor to draft 
young men. He urged "resistance!" 
because to serve would be to grant 
that the state has the power to take 
an individual's life. 

The militia responded very slowly 
and Shay's rebellion spread. As the 
deaths and insurrection increased, 
and as other slates became concerned 
about similiar uprisings, the GovernDr 
issued a sterner draft call. 

Loyal Americans then responded; 
and order, and the recently-earned 
American freedoms, were preserved... 

The war was going badly for the 
North. In March of IB63 volunteers were 
no longer sufficient so, realizing the 
preservation of the Union was at stake. 
President Abraham Lincoln issued a 
draft call. 

Steve Gibson, a young risionary, 
was apatlcd. Gibson bravely voiced his 
convictions; "Why should young men 
be forcod to die in some faraway state 
so the New England economic interests 
can be preserved? If we admit the 
government has the right to sacrifice 
our lives, we are surrendering our 
basic freedo-n-ihe right to control one's 
own life." 

There was widespread opposition to 
Lincoln's draft. But fortunately for 
all American's, particularly those en- 
slaved in the South, most young men 
choose to answer their call to duty... 
President Franklin Roosevelt was 
concerned. The war was going poorly for 
the Allies. Volunteers wereh't suffi- 
cient to meet the war needs, so the 
draft was used 

But once again, a youthful messiah 
spoke out. Bill Gibson fearlessly said, 
"To respond to Ihe draft would be 
losing the very freedom the government 
claims we'd be fighting for." 

Fortunately for freedom-loving people 
throughout the world, hero-worshippers 
of Gibson like Jimmy Ellis were few. 
Most young Americans chose to answer 
the call and risk their lives in an attempt 
to stem the tide of totalitarianism... 

And now today we have Jeff Gibson, 
Oh, conditions are changed. For 
example, Vietnam is an unpopular war. 
But Ihe Gibson principal is either uni- 
versal or non-existent; that is, the 
state has no right to a draft. 

Personally, j favor a volunteer army, 
but I guess I'm kind of glad the past 
Gibson "messiahs" failed. 



The Communicator welcomes Hark 
Souder as a new suffer who will be 
writing a regular feature column 
entitled " As I See lt."We figured it 
was the best way to keep him bjsy 
while we got our work done.

Final commentary on Jeff 
Gibson's resistance to the draft- 
Channeling 



by Marly Martinez 



"Where is it written in the Constitu- 
tion, and in what article or section is 
it contained that you may take children 
from their parents and parents from 
their children and compel them to fight 
the battles of any war in which the 
folly or wickedness of government may 
engage." -Daniel Webster, 1814* 

In Ihe two previous articles we dis- 
cussed Jeff Gibson's reasons for re- 
sisting the draft, and the assumptions 
made by the Selective Service system 
with regards to military conscription. 
The document "Channeling" was men- 
tioned as being one of ten documents 
in an "Orientation Kit" put out by the 
Selective Service. 

II was issued in July, I96S and was 
withdrawn when ii fell into "unauthor- 
ized hands." However, it has never 
been rescinded either by application or 

This week, the message of the doc- 
ument will be considered. It begins: 
"One ol the major products of the Sel- 
ective Service classification process 
is the channeling of manpower into many 
endeavors, occupations, and activities 
that are in the national interest...'" 

Gibson feels this distinction implies 
that the national interest no longer has 
anything to do with serving the people: 
It is now the people serving the stale. 

"This violates our basic legal rights 
as citizens of this Democratic United 
States of America." The violation is 
deliberate and for a specific purpose: 
"The process of channeling ...is actual 
procurement by Inducement of manpower 
for civilian activities which are man- 
ifestly in Ihe national interest." 

Gibson feels that in this the sUte 
establishes itself as, not only the 
owner of the man, but the arbiter of his 
vrorth and evaluator of his pursuits. 
And the reason given is that the person 
would not act in the defense of our 
natiD.1 unless coerced. Coercion t&gt;ecomes 
obvious and explicit, as the document 
tries to cover such a repugnant word 
under the guise of patriotism. 



"The psychology of granting wide 
choice under pressure," the document 
says, "is the American or indirect 
way of achieving what is done by direc- 
tion In foreign countries where choice 
is not permitted. Here, choice is limited 
but not denied, and it is fundamental 
that an individual generally applies 
himself better to something he has deci- 
ded Co do rather than something he has 
been told to do. (ed. note: In other 
words, the difference between our 
country and others is the difference bv 
tween overt and covert oppression? 
Incredible!) 

Thus, according to Gibson, what 
begins to emerge Is a government 
which holds a club over the head of each 
male to force him into roles beneficial 
to the national interest and at his 
expense and expenditure if necessary. 

If such a purpose were indeed that of 
the Selective Service System, then it 
would provide controls for the excep- 
tions, those unfit for service. Gibson 
points to the classification 1-Y which 
in the wards of the Selective Service 
document, "reminds the registrant 
of his ultimate qualification to serve 
and prese'ves some of the benefit of 
what w: call channellnc." 

The paradox of dealing with dehuma- 
nized creatur&lt;is becomes apparent with 
the closing paragraphs of the document. 

"Deciding whit people should do, 
rather than letting Ihem do sonelhing 
of national Importance of their own 
choosing, introduces many problems that 
arc at least partially avoided when in- 
direct msthods, the kind currently 
Invoked by the Selective Services System 
are used." 

"Delivery of manpower for induction, 
the process of providing a few thousand 



n toa 



:eplior 



of an administrative or financial challenge 
It Is in dealing with the other millions 
of registrants that the System is heavily 
occupied, developing mijre effective 
humin beings In the national interest. 
If there Is to be any survival after dis- 
aster, it will take people, and not ma- 
chines, to restore the nation."

Wright speaks 
on campus

A visitor marvelled at the potential and 
progress of the l-PU Campus Wednesday. 
Joe Wright, environmental education con- 
sultant for the State Department of Public 
Instruction, Division of Curriculum, spent 
the day hiking and speaking with faculty 
members and students. 

He described the work of his office in 
encouraging outdoor laboratories for all 
studies, developing curriculum guide K-ll 
establishing wider participation in teacher 
workshops, and fostering community-insti- 
tution cooperation in environmental educa- 



Mr. Wright described programs in Indi- 
ana, Kentucky and San Diego .California- 
which he has assisted. The natural re- 
sources of our campus for study purposes 
arc their variety and beauty. 

He is impressed with the multidiscip- 
linary learning situations now working 
out on our campus and would hope teacher 
training include more training in conser- 

Mr. Wright's visit here was sponsored 
by the Student Alpha chapter of liaak 
Walton. 




I tried discussing this with my professa 
once, but when I noticed him estimating

only hope was for the semester &lt;o end.

Selective Service regulations listed 

Col. Wayne E. Rhodes , director of Ihe ^ 



Col. Wayne E, Rhodes , director of Ihe 
Indiana Selective Service, recently 
announced new Selective Service regula- 
tions. They areas follows: 
1. Reclassification under new Selective 
Service law will begin November 16, 1971 
7. The 1971 National call number (ceil- 
ing) Is 125 for birth years 1944-SO, I9SI. 

3. Freshmen who began college study 
either in the Summer of 1971 or Fall 1971 
will not be eligible for deferment, 

4. Sophomores, Juniors and Seniors who 
successfully satisfied degree requirement: 
during the past year will warrant continu- 
ation of their student deferments, 

5. Students who do not have deferments 
and are called for induction into the mili- 
tary service will not be pulled out of 
school during Ihe semester, If the stu- 
dent is a Senior, postponement for the 
academic year is possible to enable him 
to graduate. 

6. It appears that it will be a National 
policy by the end of the year for local 
draft boards to notify students that they 
have a high lattery number (over 126) and 
request them to take a |-A classification 
and thus utilize Iheir available period of 
eligibility and pass directly into the se- 
cond priority class. 



7. Once a student loses his l(-S (student 
deferment) he can no longer get il back. 
The |.S-C deferment no longer exists, 
S. Except for students in the healing arts 
graduate students are not eligible for 
student deferments, 

9. An Incoming Freshman cannot be 
classified pre-medical under healing arts. 
To qualify for a l|-S deferment, the stu- 
dent must be a fully accepted profession- 
al student. 

10. An undergraduate student enrolled in 
a University recognized five-year iinder- 
gradu^'te program is eligible for a defer- 
ment for that period of time. The extent 
of program must be clearly defined in the 
University, catalog. 

I I. A student extends his draft eligibil- 
ity until the age of 3S if he receives a 
student deferment. However, for all In- 
tensive purposes, when he reaches age 
26, he is "ho..ie free", 
12. A new l-H (holding) classification 
has been introduced. This classification 
will be for young men whose processing 
does not appear to be forthcoming (i.e. 
those without lottery number, those with 
high lottery number, those in second prior- 
ity class, etc),

It is with these p oblems that PD&gt;0 is 
concerned. Last summer Ihe standards 
for handicapped ace 'modalions were re- 
searched in both the United States Cade 
and the Slate of Indiana Bums Statutes,.. 
and the campus facilities were checked 
against these standards. Needless to say, 
the campus failed miserably.

But our ultimate goal is not the satis-

to assimilate the handicapped students 
into the natural flow of student life. This

Mastodon cheerleaders ready 
for basketball season action 



by DV'ell Parnin 

Some will remember this reporter as a 
meatgrinder they once caught their hand 
in. Others will recall the "black belt" I 
was awarded in writing karate: a title 
stripped from me after I referred to cheer- 
leaders as a select group of people who 
"carry the moon in a silver bag and the 
sun in a golden cup," 

As last year, this year's cheerleaders 
will create wild excitement for sports— 
as much as a bear in a bunkhouse would. 
Once it was only "sis-boom-bah" , but now 
vocal empathy is the bag of our collegiate 
cheerleaders. 

Cheers at our campus range from famil- 
iar neoclassic fight chants to happy ex- 
hortations, solid yells, unsanctified and 
sanctified soul. 

On loo many campuses becoming a yell- 
leader is a social-political activity and 
one where the sweat is largely devoted to 
attaining the position, not performing It,

A panel of four student body officers 
from the Joint Athletic Committee selects 
the winning girls. The girls are judged on 
figure, face, poise, posture, individual 
cheering, pep, voice and tumbling. 

Who are the cheerleaders^ 

A Norlhside graduate called Little Toad 
A second year cheerleader. Brenda Rouse 
is "Funnyrace""Smiles. laughter, and a 
world of cheering-optimism. 

No doubt Brenda remembers the laughter 
a restaurant manager got last season on 
an away game trip, A coordinated member 
of the basketball squad accidently caused 
a waitress to drop a tray of drinks. The 
manager came to the scene. "Don't 
worry son," he sard, "we've been plannir^ 
to allow patrons in with their pet dogs 



The cheerleaders?' 

A farm girl turned weighilifter whu is 
an alternate on the U.S. Olympic team In 
Munich 1972. Sandi Jones-Atlas to her 
friends"is a blonde finger snapping premod 
aspirant from Dssian. Since Sandi is the 
base in all cheerleading formations, she 
undoubtedly hopes all the girts remain 
weight conscious, and not earn any affect- 
ionate "lead bottom" nicknames. 

The cheerleaders? 

A second year blonde haired cheerleader 
who quips "knickers are hotpants for wo- 
men that have cooled off." Patti Schmid 
missed half of last seasons' games due to 
a broken arm sustained on the second day 
of yell practice. Don't wish her pje-sea- 
son luck by saying "break a leg." 

The cheerleaders? 

A tumbling and gymnastics enthusiasts, 
attractive Betty Lou Barnes contends her 
boyfriend likes the Chicago Bears more 
than he does her. He agrees, but adds 
"I still like her more than basketball." 
Betty Lou's smile is as fresh and bright 
as her favorite flower-the daisy. 

The cheerleaders? 

A Ft, Wayne native who holds a secret 
desire to sky dive. Tumbling and workoub 
on the uneven parallel bars do not suggest 
the nickname of "Runt," that this brunet- 
te girl's friends have lagged her. Diane 
Dieti seems more a tiger—a high diver 
who'd stand on a tiny platform up 100 ft., 
and have a coin flip determine whether the 
pool is empty or full. 

ir Indiana-Purdue is a "dull campus" 
when it comes to various forms of student 
involvement, it is not dull on the basket- 
ball court. These five cheerleaders bring 
a flair to the game and to the crowd be- 
cause they decidedly "give a damn."
