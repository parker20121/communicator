IPSGA news 

Judicial Court Chief Justice found ineligible 



By Felicia Beeching, 

Editor ID chief, and 

EvristieSchlundt, 

News editor 

' On Monday, a majotily of the In- 
diana Purdue Sludenl Government 
Associalion (IPSGA) met to pass 
resoluiions, consiilulional amend- 
menis and to approve three judicial 
court nominees. 

Approved for judicial court were 
Murray Moodhy, Les Williams, and 
(or Chief Justice, Elbert Webster. 

The Communicator received a lip 
Monday afternoon that Webster, (a 
former IPSGA senator and vice 
picsideni of legislation last semes- 
ter), may no longer be an IPFW slu- 
denl which, under Ihe IPSGA Con- 
stitulion, disqualifies him from his 
newly elected position as chief jus- 
lice. 

! As stated in the IPSGA Constilu- 
lion, sludcnt govemmeni's Inlemal 
Affairs Commiliee verifies the eligi- 
bility of students to participate in 
student government. 
■ "l assumed that the president ran 
ihat check," said Mark King, chair 
of Ihe Internal Affaire Commiliee. 

"They have never sent any ap- 
pointee through my committee. 
They are also supposed to send sen- 
atorial candidales through my com- 
mittee and didn't," explained King. 

King coniinued. "I've never been 
allowed lo invcsligaie these things, 
because if the president of the sen- 
ate [Vice President of Legislation 
Jerry Richardson] says Ihat I can't, 
then I can'l. That's why one of my 
projects is to remove Internal Af- 
fairs from the executive branch and 
lo put It under the judicial branch." 

IPSGA Vice Presideni of Legisla- 
tion Jerry Richardson explained that 
the process by which the student 
government confirms the eligibility 
of a nominee "goes straight to the 
iDean of Students and bypasses in- 
lernal affairs because the process 
has been streamlined. 
I "If that's a violation of ihe Consti- 
tution, then we need to change the 



constitution," said Richardson. 

When first asked who had checked 
Webster's eligibility lo sit on the ju- 
dicial court, Student Body Presideni 
Rajat Sun said that he had asked ihe 
Dean of Students office to check if 
Webster was eligible to sit on the ju- 
dicial court. 

"We decided last year that it 
wasn't good for students on com- 
mittees to check other students' 
GPA's and other confidenlial infor- 



slatus during the spring semester. 

Webster could not be reached 
by phone to comment on the 
appoinlment. 

"We were working under ihe as- 
sumption that he was a student. I 
certainly thought he was qualified," 
said Richardson. 

"You people at The Communicator 
are always looking for a conspiracy 
. . . you're seeing inlemal things as 
if that's all we do. You're not look-

mation, so that's why we chose the 
Dean's office lo verify the informa- 
tion," said Sun. "He [Webster] was 
eligible in July when the Dean's of- 
fice checked-" 

Dean of Students Marian Zimmer- 
man was not available for comment 
regarding the issue of Webster's eli- 
gibility at press time. 

Vice Chancellor of Student Affaire 
Frank Borelli said. "You'd have lo 
talk to Marian Zimmerman about 
the check regarding that particular 
student, but the Dean of Students 
makes those checks at the beginning 
of each semester." 

"I don't see that it's a big deal — 
if you don't meet Ihe requirements, 
then you can't be an officer. It is au- 
tomatically null and void," Suri 
said. 

Webster registered for fall classes, 
but totally withdrew on August 19, 
according lo the Registrar's office. 
Furthermore, the registrar's office 
indicated that Webster had not been 
eligible to participate in sludenl 
government based on his student 



ing at Ihe results of the whole body 
[of IPSGA branches]," Richardson 
added. 

Other IPSGA business during 
Monday's meeting included 
Richardson introducing four varia- 
tions of an araendmeni lo the IPS- 
GA Constitution to insure ihe prop- 
er line of succession in case the stu- 
dent body president's position be- 
comes vacant. 

Approved was the following hier- 
archy of succession: 1. vice presi- 
dent of legislation, 2. vice president 
of sludenl activities, and 3 vice 
president of finance. Additionally, 
any vice president who is not elect- 
ed (but appointed through vacancy) 
is not allowed to be considered for 
the position of president. 

This reverses the order previously 
in the Constitution of vice presideni 
of finance in the number two slot 
and vice presideni of sludenl activi- 
ties in the third slot.

IPFW professor emeritus 
publishes autobiography 



By Kristle Schluodt, 
News editor 

On Monday September 20, Foi- 
lelt's Book Store will host an auto- 
graph session for IPFW Professor 
Emeritus James Dudley Woolf. 
Woolf will be on hand most of the 
day to speak lo students, faculty and 
staff and to sign copies of his auto- 
biography, 'The Search for Self A 
Study of Ihe Poetic Mind,' which is 
already on the shelves at the 
bookstore. 

Woolf's autobiography traces his 
life's journey from the midwestern 
farm where he lived as child to the 
universities where he taught; from 
his "first poetical creation:" 'Hop, 
froggie, hop; Hop. froggie, hop; 
Hop froggie, hop,' 10 one of his 
most recent poetical creations, 
'Supreme Shakespeare' (see page 
8). 

A specialist in the poetry of the 
Romantic period, Woolf said thai he 
thinks of poetry "such ihal it should 
be harmonious with Christianity, 
which is a critical approach to 
poetry." 

Woolf explained that the signifi- 
cance of poetry and religion in his 




life is that both are inextricably 
bound to his definition of self. He 
pointed to the following passage in 
his auiobiography and said, "I can't 



say 



.1 better than this 



Poelry is an emotionalized imita- 
tion of life in rhythm, with love as 
Ihe guiding force in the emotion 
and the imitation, in such an 
eclecticism that one con appre- 
hend clearly and comprehensively 
unity in mulfiformity. In such an 
adventure I have not only made 
my small contribution (o the na- 
ture of poetry, but also I have 
made o signihcnnl discovery, and 
expressed it, in my search for self.

STAFf EPITORIAI, 

IPSGA and 'Good Faith' 




This week's student government 
meetings started out great. Atten- 
dance was at an all lime high and 
both the senate and whole IPSGA 
government seems productive at 
the start of the semester. We ap- 
plaud you for that. 

But the incident concerniiig ju- 
dicial court's chief justice ap- 
pwintee Elbert Webster gives stu- 
dent government a blemish. 
(Without recapping the whole sto- 
ry, please read page 1.) It seems 
that IPSGA needs the Dean's of- 
fice to check a candidate's eligi- 
bility twice, not just once. At the 
time of nominalion, {in July), El- 
bert was enrolled for the fall se- 
mester and passed the eligibility 
check. However, as the IPSGA 
Constitution states, at the time of 
election (Monday), determines 
whether eligibility requirements 
are met. Ajid, by September, El- 
bert had withdrawn from school. 

Some have argued that Elbert is 
the best person for the job. We 
don't doubt that - he ts a serious 
student - and he has done much 
good in student government as a 
former senator and vice president 
of legislation. 

The deeper issue is that persons 
who are not currently IPFW stu- 
dents absolutely should not be on 
IPFW student government. 
IPSGA does not need to set a 
precedent like that. It could lead 
to further abuse down the road. 

For instance, last year, Jim 
Walker, former infamous editor in 
chief of The .Corpmunicaior (now 
an IPSGA'studenfseiTaipr), hired 
a sporis"e"dii_orwho dropped all 
his classes, continued in his posi- 
tion as sports editor the rest of the 
semester, in in spite of the fact he 
was not a student. (The Commu- 
nicator bylaws require student ed- 
itors to be enrolled 3-6 credit 



hours depending on the position.] 
'Good faith' is a principle used 
in business everywhere. Seldom 
does an employer check out 
which universities a prospective 
employee graduated. If it's on the 
resume, one assumes it is true. In 
good faith, students active in stu- 
dent organizations should notify 
the proper authorities if they lose 
eligibility requirements- In El- 
bert's case, we are unable to de- 
termine whether or not he as- 
sumed that his nominalion for ju- 
dicial court was automatically 
void, or whether he was going to 
quietly be chief justice until he re- 
turns next semester (according to 
the rumor mill). We have been 
unable to reach Webster for com- 
ment. We hope he replies. 

On an additional note. President 
Suri has the right idea when he 
continued former student body 
president Kristina Frazier-Henry's 
policy of maintaining student 
confidentiality within the confines 
of student government commit- 
tees. Instead of students seeing 
other students' GPAs and other 
various confidential information, 
only the Dean of Students' office 
checks for eligibility require- 
ments. 

One last comment - we think it's 
tacky thai we have been sent a 
message loud and clear from 
some student government mem- 
bers that if we printed this story 
about Elbert Webster that there 
would eventually be "(rouble" 
(as in SS withdrawn) for The 
Communicator. Isn't this censor- 
ship of the press? Surely. Vice 
President of Legislation Jerry 
Richardson (former managing ed- 
itor of The Communicator) and 
Senator Jim Walker (former editor 
in chieO should be our first de- 
fenders. 



Dear Aunt Louise, 

I'm friends with this girl, but we 
really haven't gotten to know each 
other on more than jusi a friendly 
level. Recently, I had her over lo my 
place and things got a little out of 
hand. We became a little more ac- 
quainted with each other than I ex- 
pected. I'm the type of guy who 
feels that there has to be a relation- 
ship before one becomes acquainted 
with each other physically. Anyway, 
after the little incident, I feel as if I 
have broken my set of personal val- 
ues. What should I do?

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 



'Zoo Story' Inspires 



Letter to the Editor: 

Purdue-Indiana Theatre (PIT) 
and the School of Fine Arts 
should be commended for their 
outdoor theatre production of Ed- 
ward Albee's "The Zoo Story." 1 
attended last Saturday and found 
the setting in front of the Friends 
Pavilion very appealing. What I 
enjoyed most of all. of course, 
was the choice of a Pulitzer Prize- 
winning playwright's extremely 
timely play, and the very engag- 
ing performance of the two stu- 
dent actors Andrew Topp and 
Colby Prough. The 75 minutes 
the play lasted went by too quick- 
ly, and I left with the desire to re- 



read all of Albee's works. 

I hope that plays of high literary 
value will continue lo be per- 
formed throughout the fall/winter 
semester in some equally conge- 
nial indoor setting. Since these 
performances are free of charge, 
nobody can complain about high 
ticket prices, and everybody in 
the university community, inter- 
ested in literature and the arts, 
should be able lo spare 75 min- 
utes for thought-provoking cultur- 
al entertainment on a campus 
which could use more of such.

Yours, 
NoSelor\'alues 

Dear No Set of Values, 
First of all, you need to understand 

that you are only human. Everyone 
makes mistakes, darlin'! The thing 
you need to do is no longer make 
thai mistake. Stop being so hard on 
yourself. 

It sounds like lo me that both of 
you gave mutual consent. Now if 
your conscience is getting to you, 
you need to sit this gal down and 
talk about it. Tell her how you feel. 
Ask her how she feels. 

You know I was talking to my 
grandson, Clarence, who is proba- 
bly about your age. He tells me that 
sometimes when two people meet 
they end up having a relationship 
with no strings attached. Do you un- 
derstand, what I'm saying? 

They're not sex partners (yes, I am 
hip lo you young folks!), just close 
friends who are lovers, but can also 
function as friends. Now, I know 
my Dorcus and I never had any type 
of relationship like that until I was 
married. Why I was pure as the dri- 
ven snow! But, that's not lo say I 
am condoning or condemning what 
you two do. Maybe in today's world 
two people need to have relation- 



ships like that. As long as the two 
people involved know what is at 
stake, give mutual consent, use pro- 
tection, and care for each other your 
loving Aunt Louise can only be in 
full support as long as no one is get- 
ting hurt by your actions, 

I teel that if you two can sit down 
and talk about what happened, 
things will work out just fine. 

Your loving Aunt Louise 

Dear Aunt Louise, 

First of all, I would like lo say that 
I have been reading your column 
every week and I think you have 
some good advice. Plus, you offer it 
with a sense of humor. So would 
you advise me? 

My boyfriend and I are opposites. 
If he's hot, I'm cold. He likes base- 
ball and hockey and all that guy 
stuff. I like PIT and the Fort Wayne 
Philharmonic and the Civic Theatre, 
He likes dogs; I like cats. Well, you 
gel the picture. 

Anyway, he keeps pushing me to 
do the stuff he likes, but, he won't 
even consider doing things I like. 
Overall, though, he is pretty good to 
me most of the time. I mean. I can't 
count on him gelling me flowers for 
Valentine's Day or remembering 
my birthday, but he doesn't seem to 



mind having me around on a day to 
day basis, and we almost never 
fight. 

So what do you think? Am I plac- 
ing too much importance on what 
may be litlle things? He is going to 
college, like me, and already has a 
good job. But I just can't help feel- 
ing that maybe this isn't going to 
work out. 

Sincerely, 
Wondering 

Dear Wondering, 

Honey, thank you so much for the 
compliments, but we need to talk. 
Are you placing loo much impor- 
tance on the little things? You're not 
placing enough! Honey, this here 
feller needs to make you feel want- 
ed and loved, not tolerated or put up 
with, Lotdy, a person puts up with 
dogs not human beings. I don't 
think you are relating yourself to the 
level of a dog. You sound like a 
sweet loving woman who wants a 
loving man to treat her like a jewel 
as I'm sure you irealhim. 

So, what you need to do is ask him 
to treat you like a lady. Ask him 
why hasn't he done those special 
things for you lately. You need to 
say 1993 is about me. 

Your loving Aunt Louise

You didn't hear it from me, but... 



by F. Lane Duuse, 
Managing Editor 

What's up! I'm back for another 
edition of The Communicator. You 
know I have some really good stuff 
to share with you Ihis wecltcnd. 

First of all, I think we need lo look 
into the parking lot situation. I did 
my homework and called campus 
security. Oh, yes, I did. And i found 
out that anyone with an A parking 
placard can park anywhere on cam- 
pus except for E parking which is 
for maintenance staff, if my memo- 
ry serves me right. 

What a crock of crap! I think it is 
not fair that professors can park in 
B-paiking. 1 don't care if they pay 
sixty dollars for their placards. If 
they can park anywhere, students 
should be allowed to park any- 
where. And just where is the money 
for these parking placards going 
anyway? 

Certainly not into installing traffic 
lighLs on Ihis campus which is need- 
ed at the new entrance because 
those four way slop signs aren't get- 
ting the job done. 

It's not fair to have campus securi- 
ty out there directing the traffic. I 
don't care if it's their job or not. The 
weather is becoming a little bit 
colder every day. If it is snowing, is 
the administration going to have 
campus security out there directing 
traffic? 

The other tidbit is a little traffic 
story I think all of my readers will 
find amusing. A friend of mine wit- 
nessed a young student who drives a 
black car jump out of his car in ihc 
middle of Irufnc and verbally bad- 
ger a driver in front of him because 
of his disconlenl with the way the 
person drives. 

How can you dare criticize some- 
one else about their driving skills, 



when you're jump- 
ing out of your car? 
There is no place in 
the driving manual 
that says drivers are 
allowed to jump out 
of their vehicles and 
ball anyone who 
angers them out. 

Just a hint for any- 
one else considering 
pulling a stunt like 
that: the incident 
was reported to 
campu.s security and 
a formal complaint 
by the victim has 
not been made yet. Therefore, I sug- 
gest you remain in your car and yell 
obscenities like everyone else. 

Another complaint brought to my 
attention is the fact that we all have 
some students in our classes who 
can not keep their mouths shut. Re- 
cently, a friend told me about a stu- 
dent who was listening to a profes- 
sor's suggestion of someone volun- 
teering to read a book. This student 
proceeds lo make a distasteful re- 
mark about reading another book, 
like she was even asked! The pro- 
fessor ends up assigning the book to 
the whole class. This is a case in 
wblch the student needs to stop 
and listen In what is being said, 
instead of not paying aKcntion! 

By the way for those of you who 
are concerned with the lab in Walb. 
I think you need to know I found 
out whal you don't know. 

First of all, this area was chosen 
because of the location for incom- 
ing freshman and the type of com- 
puters in Walb. If you didn't know, 
all students have to take an admis- 
sions lest to gel into Ihis university. 
Well, now, they have a new comput- 
er program in which the students are 
tested on these computers which 




will allow the ad- 
missions personnel 
to place the fresh- 
man students or re- 
luming adults in the 
correct classes. This 
program the admis- 
sions department is 
using is currently 
being used by uni- 
versities across the 
nation. 

Not only that, be- 
fore the lab was 
created, they had lo 
ask students who 
were working on 
assignments lo leave the labs over 
in Ketller so they could use the pro- 
gram. They would expect about 300 
students for one testing period, and 
only fifteen would show up. So, you 
can see this is a service for students 
who do need to use the facilities. 

By the way. there is a new lab in 
Ketller G13. So, check it out! I also 
was informed by Mark Queen, a re- 
ally nice gentleman who helped de- 
velop the lab, that there are new 
labs coming to Kettler in the area of 
math and teaching labs with new 
computers. Remember, there are 
labs in Classroom Medical for Aits 
and Sciences students (any student 
taking an English or math course), 
Neff, and the ones in Kettler. 

Let's sec what else is there to talk 
about, oh, I was over in Classroom 
Medical (CM) when I saw a female 
student with a cast on hopping 
down the stairs. Now, excuse me, 
that's like an accident wailing to 
happen; especially, when there is an 
elevator service for students with 
disabilities or temporary injuries 
such as a broken bone. 
Why not use them, eh? 
Or are you just asking to gel hurl 
some more and have the school in- 




cure more liability' 

I don't think so. 

You didn't hear it from me, but, I 
heard an IPSGA officer reported a 
typewriter lost. And people I do 
have to ask you this: how do you 
lose a typewriter? Now car keys I,' 
can understand, but a typewriter!; 
What did you do, lose it in your| 
backpack? I 

Since we're on the area of Sludenti 
Government, I think something^ 
needs to be said about the recent ap\ 
pointment of the chief justice of Ihd 
judicial court of IPSGA, I want the 
readers lo know several things. 

First of all, this isn't an issue 
about whether the student is quali 
fied or not. This is an issue of fol- 
lowing the procedures of your Con- 
stitution. That's what this is about. 
If elected officials do not follow 
their own Constitution, they 
violation of their Constitution 
Thai's not a value judgment as Vice 
Presideni of Legislation Jerry 
Richardson suggests. It's just reality 
which is what he needs to accept. 

None of this would have happenec 
if the government was following 
their Constitution which states Iha 
the Internal Affairs Commiilee is ir 
charge of screening all elected offi- 
cials. 

The second and final point is tba 
the violation becomes a big dea 
when IPSGA officers do not feel a* 
if they have done anything wrong oi 
when they make statements like "I 
that's a violation of the constitu 
tion then we need to change Iht 
constitution," 

And that siatcmeni was made bj 
your Vice President of Legislation 
Jerry Richardson, 

Hey, that's it for Ihis week. Every-j 
one take care. Remember, yoif 
didn't hear it from me, but . . , ;

Letter to the Editor 



Flower child reminisces 



I thoroughly enjoyed the ( 
tary. "Hippie," by Mark S. Snyder in 
the September 2nd Issue! it made 
me think of a poem I wrote while at- 
tending Southern Illinois University 
in 1987. 1 was ihe only "gray-head" 
in many of my classes and there had 
been some discussion of the sixties. 
Of course, everyone turned to me 
for my personal experiences of the 
times. Since one of my courses was 
a poetry class, I wrote the enclosed 



poem in explanation. This was a 
"tongue-in-cheek" effort and cer- 
tainly not an example of good poet- 
ry, but it is my sixties experience. 

Mark is so right. The sixties was a 
set of values and the legacy contin- 
ues; I am also proud of my "flower- 
child" mentally and have no inten- 
tion of changing.

semester. 

He is the vocalist for a local 
group, The Pop 'n' Fresh band. 
Other members include Travis 
Brown, Jeremy Sells, and organist 
Pete Smith. 

The Pop 'n' Fresh band is a 
unique blend of classic rock, blues, 
and soul with a contemporary edge. 
This combination is brought about 
naturally by a mix of properly sea- 
soned musical performers and fresh, 
young players that produce an inter- 
esting flavor of music that can satis- 
fy a variety of tastes. 

"I'm the Pop. and they're the 
fresh," explained Brown. This is in 
reference to his being the Dad or 
(Pop) of the group's bassist Travis 



Brown. 

These chefs of sound serve up a 
soulful slew with the ingredients of 
legendary artists such as James 
Brown, Otis Redding, and Wilson 
Pickett. They offer up a course of 
classic blues, both rare and well 
done, from traditional recipes like 
T-Bone Walker, B.B. King, and 
Buddy Guy. as well as offerings by 
today's legends such as Slevte Ray 
Vaughn. 

And for those of you who hunger 
for good old rock and roll. Pop 'n' 
Fresh can lake you back to that au- 
thentic drive-in menu by recalling 
the best of Elvis. Buddy Holly, Ed- 
die Cochran, and many others. 

This is one group who really likes 
lo cook and is sure to stimulate the 
appetite for dancing as they offer 
both slow and fast dance specialties. 

"Food is more enjoyable when it 
looks good as well as tastes good. 
Well, ihis band not only sounds 



"Well, this band not only sounds good, 

but also garnishes the stage with 
a tantalizing display of showmanship." 

- By Ted Brown 



good, but also garnishes the stage 
with a laniatizing display of show- 
manship." said Brown. 

There is no need lo endure a bland 
diet with these guys. As an added 
spice, the Pop 'n' Fresh band also 
delivers an assorimenl of their own 
original material that covers a wide 
range of style from traditional lo 
hints of a soul food of the future. 

The band is a true collaboration of 
young and more aged seasoning of 
ideas that enables them lo cook up 
an exclusive musical menu. 

"Of course, the young chefs allow 
us a slight edge, but they have great 
ideas and suggestions, and we listen 
lo what they have to add to the 
recipe, that's what keeps it fresh," 



said Brown. 

Their menu has old favorites lo 
pick such as "Can't Turn You 
Loose," "Midnight Hour." and 
"Knock 00 Wood." 

Another "fresh" element of the 
band is Ibeir drummer, Jeremy 
Sells, son of local bass player, Jim 
Sells. 

Jeremy and Travis have practically 
grown up jamming together with 
Ted occasionally silling in giving 
pointers, 

"We had been jammin' just for fun 
now and iSen for years, then we 
suddenly realized that we're not on- 
ly having a good.time, but we were 
really cookin' and "we knew about 
enough material to do a gig," said 



Brown. 

Also helping hold down the "Pop" 
half or more mature portion of the 
band, is Pete Smith. Smith plays the 
big classic Hammond B-3 Organ. 
Pete and Ted have worked together 
for twenty-some years, when they 
were in a group called Dave Taylor 
and the Clique. 

After thai, they went on to Miami, 
Florida, and then on to Nashville, 
Tennessee. Smith has also worked 
with many headline acts such as the 
Ink Spots, the Marcels, the 
Vagabonds, and the Diamonds. 

Brown has worked with various R 
&amp; B performers such as Gary U.S. 
Bonds, Little Eva, and the Shirelles. 

While living in Nashville, Brown, 
in addition to working with and 
recording a variety of writers and 
artists, was privileged to be in- 
volved in a recording group with 
Billy (jjx. bassist for Jimi Hcndrix 
in the Band of Gypsies. 



Brown also had the good fortune 
lo have co-wriilen a song thai 
reached 24 on the Billboard Coun- 
try charts entitled. "Sunday After- 
noon Boatridc in the Park on the 
Lake." He has also written a song 
for a movie called "H.O.T.S.," 
shown occasionally on the cable 
channels. 

The mix of generations represent- 
ed in the group is their way of how 
lo bridge the generation gap. 

Their goal is lo present a unique 
version of classic Rhythm and 
Blues, Soul, Rock, and to present a 
young, "fresh," raw edge, 

"The younger members have their 
own contemporary influences and 
musical tastes, having picked up 
their feel for Ilie Blues of Iheir 
'funk-ability' through a process of 
osmosis growing up around It as 
they seem to 'cop' those grooves 
fairly naturally," said Brown.

Rock musical logged daily by cast member 



By Mark S. Snyder 
Guest Wrilcr 

This newspaper has suggested that 
you, iLs reader, mighi be interested 
in a diaiy — of sorts — of the nighlly 
rehearsals for HAIR. As a member 
of ihc cast, 1 have been asked to 
kcepihe following diary. 
DAY! 

"Hcl! no, we won'l go!" While the 
words of this '60s chanl remained 
unspoken, ihey could be Celt in the 
rehearsal room as the eyes of Ihe 
cast members, many too young lo 
have been born in Ihc '60s. receded 
the bodies of dead Gl's, napalm- 
scarred bodies of screaming Viet- 
namese children and bloodied vis- 
ages of civil rights workers, while 
gazing transfixed at these images 
being projected on a screen as a part 
of Dr. Louis Cantor's film collage 
which he presented to the cast. Then 
Ihc presenialioQ, accompanied with 
appropriate musical statements of 
the period ended, a sadness tinged 
with anger pervaded the room. 

More than one pair of eyes welled 
up with tears as they questioned Dr. 
Cantor, or related their own person- 
al reminiscence of those times. Il 
seems thai everyone was touched in 
some way by the '60s. 

As Ihe Vielnam War Memorial al- 
lesls. "the war look the lives of nol 
only sons, but fathers, mothers, 
brothers, and sisters." As the casi 
members filed out of the rehearsal 
room, it was apparent that the '60s 
search for an Age of Aquarius, an 
era of "harmony and understand- 
ing," was now more than Ihe ab- 
stract words lo a song from the play 
they were about to underlake. 

DAY 2 
Work begins. Tonight we v

learn the songs Aquarius, Donna, 
Hashish, and Sodomy, but first, we 
must verbally warm up with diction 
exercises. There are several to 
learn. The favorite, however: 

"I'm a mother pheasant plucker. 

I pluck mother phcasanLs. 

I'm the most pleasant 

mother pheasant plucker. 

That ever plucked a 

mother pheasant." 

Warmed up, we begin "working 
the songs." All goes well until we 
reach Ihe song Sodomy. The song's 
lyric begins: "Sodomy, fellatio, cun- 
nilingus, pederasty..." No, no one 
seems to be offended by the lyric, 
the problem seems lo be that there 
are few in the cast that have any 
idea what these words mean, 
DAY 3 

The rain of the past few days has 
not dampened the spirits of the cast 
for as they begin to arrive, there is a 
sense of warmth and camaraderie 
already being fell among the cast 
members. 

For all of its trivializalion by the 
media, there was a feeling of broth- 
erhood and sisterhood thai existed 
in the '60s and which is beginning 
to re-ignite as Ihe cast becomes im- 
mersed in the play. 

To help kindle this flame, re- 
hearsal begins with Director Life 
having each cast member hug. 
touch, and kiss one another, so thai 



a sense of communal caring and 
love can be established with the 
casi. 

We continue to "work Ihe songs" 
from Act I and it one who was a 
pari of the '60s, (as this cast mem- 
ber was) allows himself or herself 
to risk emotionally and mentally re- 
turning to Ihe years of our youth (as 
we must), it is easy lo recapture all 
of those packed-away feelings. 

As the members of the cast stand 
with one another and sing Aquarius, 
a sense of sharing, of camaraderie 
can begin to be felt infusing every- 
one. 

I think we are actually beginning 
down the road of love and peace 
that has been blockaded for so 
long — a pathway that has been de- 
nied many of the younger cast 
members. 

All is not heavy emotional reflec- 
tion, however. The sense of spon- 
taneity and play is also being recap- 
tured, as witnessed by two members 
of Ihe cast who, in a moment of un- 
inhibited playfulness, moon a pho- 
tographer who was present at the re- 
hearsal. 

DAY 4 

At last, out of the rehearsal room 
and onto the slage. Now the real 
work begins! Tonight we will 
choreograph Ihe opening of the 
show and first musical number, 



Aquarius. But first we must begin 
by removing clothing — only socks 
for now! We will perform in bare 
feet so the rehearsal will be used for 
toughening-up tender feet as well. 

We begin by learning our dance 
steps and stage movements, and fi- 
nally pulling it all together with 
singing Ihe song. A problem soon 
arises which requires Director 
Life's immediate attcnlion and pro- 
vokes his comment: "Oh god, 1 can 
tell this isn't the sixties, people do 
not know how to touch one another 
anymore." 

Those of us cast members ihat 
were the original hippies, under- 
stand. People in our society today 
seem to be uncomfortable with 
physical expressions of love and 
friendship. 

While President Clinton has re- 
stored hugging in Ihe White House. 
it has certainly not filtered through 
lo the Midwest yet! 

Peace, love, harmony are still only 
words to some in the cast too young 
to remember when those words rep- 
resented a philosophy of life, but a 
change is beginning to be fell in Ihe 
theatre. 

DAYS 
The warmth and affection among 
cast members begins lo grow. An 
occasional and spontaneous hug can 
be seen among members of the cast 



and even Ihe revival of the old icon 
of the '60s, the peace sign is occa- 
sionally seen. 

The "feeling" is growing daily. By 
opening night there will be thirty 
full-fledged flower-children on the 
stage. An occasional reprimand 
from Director Life can still be 
heard: "put your bodies together: 
you look like you are trying to hug 
over a picket fence! " 

The cast is learning though — and, 
1 suspect, enjoying it. The choreog- 
raphy we are learning is strenuous 
and when Director Life demands 
Ihat we need to make noise while 
jumping up and down in a crouch 
position, the thought occurs to this 
aging hippie: "I wonder if the be- 
ginning sounds of a cardiac arresi 
might suffice as noise?" 

Il is a good rehearsal. Much was 
accomplished, but there are obvi- 
ously going to be tired mu.scles and 
joints when some members crawl — 
and [ do mean crawl — out of bed 
for work, or school in only a few 
hours from now. 
DAY 6 

Tonighl we learn the remaining 



songs from Acl I (and believe me, 
there are many!). Tomorrow night 
everyone must be "off-score" on all 
of the songs for the first acl. 

This means ihal we have lo have 
fully commilled lo memory, all of 
the lyrics and vocal parts for 21 
songs. (And you thought you had it 
lough learning a few vocabulary 
words in your foreign language 
class!!!) 

Some songs, il appears, were im- 
mediately memorized for whatever 
reason: Sodomy and Hashish seem 
to be known by everyone already. 

Other songs — well, let's just say 
most of the cast will be doing noth- 
ing but staring into the pages of a 
musical score for the next twelve 
hours. 

And, lest you think we have noth- 
ing better to do, every member of 
the cast either has a full-time job 
and/or are taking as many as IS 
credit hours at the campus. 

Il is hard work, but a labor of 
love — especially on a play like 
HAIR whn:h has so much special 
meaning tur so many.

There is a 'blue' Moon over the AFC Central 



by Aaron N. Thompson 
Sports Editor 

Over Ihc pasi Iwo weeks, I have 
previewed Ihc NFC conference of 
the NFL and two-ihiids of the AFC. 
Now il is lime lo give a few predic- 
tions on ihe AFC Cenfral. 

The AFC Ceniral was once one of 
■be most dominaiing divisions in Ihe 
NFL, 11 is home lo Ihe Pittsburgh 
Sieelcrs, who have been the Super 
Bowl champions four limes under 
the direction of coach Chuck Knoll 
and quarterback Terry Bradshaw. 

Then there arc Ihc Cincinnati Ben- 
gals, who have made Super Bowl 
twice in ihe pasI eleven years and 
have been annual playoff con- 
tendere. 

Then you have got Ihe Cleveland 
Browns, who behind Ihe effcciive 
passing of Bernie Kosar. played in 
two conseculive AFC Conference 
games. This was no easy feai, and 
the Browns were a dominant force 
in Ihe NFL. 

Last but not least, there arc the 
Houston Oilers who have had 
much talent over Ihc years, but are 
always unable to reach the "big 
one." However, year in and year 
out, this Icam makes the playoffs 
and is always a serious considera- 
tion when considering the Super 
Bowl, 

But they are not picked lo do it 
this year. Nor is any of Ihe other 
Ihree teams. Why? Well, it is not 
easy lo say when the deterioration 
of this division began, but you can 
begin to understand it if you look 
closely. 

Due to lack of strength from the 
others. Ihc Houston Oilers will 
probably once again win this divi- 
sion. They have ihe best quarter- 
back of all Ihe teams in Warren 
Moon, bul Ihe man is gelling older 
and further from winning it all. As a 
matter of fact, last season was prob- 
ably Moon's last chance and the 
Oiler defense blew it. How often do 
teams have a quarterback and three 
receivers in Ihe Pro-Bow!? Not ver&gt;' 
often because last year's Oilers 
were Ihe firsl to ever do it. Il wasn't 
their offense thai was the problem, 
il was their loial shut down on de- 
fense. They let the Buffalo Bills 
come back from a 3S-3 defieil in the 
third quarter to win 41-38 under the

direciion of a second siring quarler- 
back. How many greal Super Bowl 
teams have ever let that happen? 
They harp about how their defense 
was number one in total yardage 
last season. They lost the game that 
counted, and thai is all that matters. 

A bright spot for the Oilers is Ihe 
addition of Buddy Ryan as defen- 
sive coordinator. He is the coach 
that' built the strong defense of the 
1985 Chicago Bears and the 
Philadelphia Eagles of recent years. 
Hopefully, management for ihe Oil- 
ers will get smart and hire him as 
coach and fire Jack Pardee. Pardee 
lacks initiative and innovation for 
the talent that he has. They will 
make the playoffs but will not be in 
them very long. 

Last season, Ihe Pittsburgh Steel- 
crs won this division and were Ihe 
second seed in ihe AFC. They were 
embarrassed by the Buffalo Bills at 
home. Barry Foster was second in 
the league in rushing last season. 
and is now threatening to hold out 
Ihe entire season if he does not gel 
Ihe money that he feels he deserves. 

The truth of the matter concerning 
Ihc Steelers is that last year was 
pretty much a fluke. Rookie quarter- 
back Neil O'Donnel was fairly im- 
pressive, but he is not Ihe savior 
that the Steelers need, in fact, it has 
been reported that he has tendonitis 
in his throwing arm and may have 
lo miss games this sea.son. Backup 
Mike Tomczak is not good enough 
lo help the Steelers make the play- 
offs. 

Sure, Foster is a quality running 
back, but he is not necessarily a 
great one. His altitude is his worst 
downfall. He just does not have the 
heart to be a great winner and com- 
petitor I think the Steelers are going 



"It wasn't their offense that was the 
problem^ it was their total shut down on 
defense. " 



lo have a disappointing year when 
compared lo lasl season. 

The Cleveland Browns are proba- 
bly Ihe bright spot in Ihis division. 
They are (he one learn thai seems to 
be realty improving. If quarterback 
Bernie Kosar can relum to Ihe form 
that led his learn lo the AFC Cham- 
pionship game, then this team might 
make a breakthrough. They have 
got good runners in Eric Metcalf 
and Leroy Hoard, and a really good 
one in Kevin Mack, if he slays with 
the learn this time. They also made 
moves to improve their defense by 
picking up Jerry Ball from the De- 
troit Lions. They may still be one 
year away, bul it wouldn't be a sur- 
prise if we see the "Dawgs" in the 
playoCTs this season. 

The Cincinnati Bengals are slill 
feeling the growing pains of a new 
coach (Dave Shuia) and basically, a 
new team. They sent Boomer Esia- 
son off lo New York and James 
Brooks off lo Cleveland. Shula has 
opied to start all over and bring in 
some youth. They've gol second 
year quarterback David Klingler 
starting and 28 other rookies or sec- 
ond year players on their rosters. 
This team is eventually going lo be 
successful, bul it is going lo take a 
period of transition. The question is, 
will the Bengals' management en- 
dure another season of losing to 
reach a better leam in the long run. 
It is debatable. However, although 



this icam is a little better than it has 
been given credit for, it will nol 
make the playoffs. That is still a 
couple years away. 

The only thing we can do now as 
fans, is lo sit and watch the games 
every Sunday and lo enjoy the sport 
the best we can. 

Oh, yeah, as a side note, I would 
like to make a response to the read- 
er that sent me a copy of my predic- 
tions with the red markings all over 
il. 

Obviously, you have a disagree- 
ment with my prediction of Min- 
nesota winning the Super Bowl this 
season. That is understandable, con- 
sidering their lopsided loss lo the 
Los Angeles Raiders on opening 
day. However, the season is still 
very young. In fad, the Vikings did 
beat Ihe Bears on Sunday. Septem- 
ber 12 as McMahon was 23-29, and 
passed tor Ihe game-winning louch- 
down. They have also picked up 



Barry Word to improve their run- 
ning game, and he did. He rushed 
for 93 yards in his first game under 
an entirely new offense for him. 

This reader is obviously a Detroit 
fan, so I shouldn't have to remind 
him of the 1991-1992 opener featur- 
ing the Lions versus the Washington 
Redskins. That was a dismal day for 
Lions fans because they were anni- 
hilated 45-0. 

However, they turned things 
around and won the NFC Central 
that year and played in the NFC 
Championship game (in which they 
were beaten again by the Washing- 
ton Redskins.) 

Concerning the Lions Ihis season, 
well Atlanta is a pretty weak team 
defensively against the tun, and I 
did stale that Barry Sanders is prob- 
ably Ihe best rusher in the league. 
So that explains Ihc Lions' 3I)-13 
stomping of the Falcons. 

But what happened against the Pa- 
Iriots? I realize that they won but 
come on, a field goal in overtime? 
Any leam of playoff caliber should 
beat the Patriots more convincingly 
than thai. After all, Buffalo beal 
ihcm in the opener 38-14, and the 
Bills are still down afler Ihc Super 
Bowl. 

Another thing to keep in mind is 



the fact that these arc predictions 
based on the past performances of 
the teams and players. I tried lo be 
as unbiased as I possibly could. For 
the record. I am not a Minnesota 
Viking fan by any means. 

Another point that 1 would like to 
make is that Paul Zimmerman, 
a.k.a. Dr. Z and prediction analyst 
for "Sports lllusirated," picked the 
Bills to win the Super Bowl for the 
past three years. This is a man that 
gels paid and paid well for making 
predictions, and he has been dead 
wrong for three straight seasons. It's 
just a matter of being lucky. I am 
going to stick behind my selection, 
100. Like I said, it is too eariy lo say 
whether 1 am wrong or right, yet. 

But, I would like lo thank the indi- 
vidual who sent me the letler stating 
his disagreement. Like 1 said, every- 
body always has a prediction. I am 
glad that this person look Ihe time 
to read my article and then write a 
response. Hopefully, though, the 
next letler will be one of agreement, 
but in this game, you never can tell.

Collegeboy's Q &amp; A's reveals intellect?? 



by Nathan Smers, 
Staff Writer 

You might be asking, "Why have 
you fallen into ihe cliche sinkhole. 
Nathan?" Aficr all. if success is 
measured by a lack of death threats, 
then my six or so columns last year 
were a 100% success. Why am I 
now serving that saccharin-flavored 
substiluie for originality, the Qi&amp;A 
column? Have I completely sold 
out? Aren't these made-up questions 
just an excuse to link small, unrelat- 
ed gags into one piece? You beicha. 
Yes, this archaic premise has been 
regurgitated by people who think 
they're funny for centuiies. I, how- 
ever, fall into the category of people 
who know they're not funny but not 
yet as unfunny as Nancy Nail — so [ 
am qualified to lake you on a safely 
guided lout through this jagged, 
plundered shipwreck of creativity. 
O&amp;A columns are Ihe cheap particle 
boards in the lumber yard that is Ihe 
humor industry; a sleazy, tawdry 
one minute read that compels you to 
lake a cold shower afterwards. So 
grab a seal, buy a bag of peanuts, 
and sing along if you know the 
words as I present my Parade of Ba- 
nality; Ask Collegcboy. 

Dear CoHegeboy: Like you, 1 am 
an English major. What do you 
plan lu do with your English 
diploma after graduation?

I'm lending bar at some go-go club.

Hey, Collegcboy. why do so 
many classrooms in colleges aad 
high schools lack windows? 

That's a good question, reader. 
The reason for this lack of windows 
is twofold: to prevent students from 
seeing the outside world and to de- 
prive students' brains of oxygen. 
Without a view of the real world. 
you cannot question the relevance 
of what you are being taught. And 
as your past knowledge dies with 
your brain cells, new information is 
indoctrinated into your remaining 
celh. An oxygen-starved mind is an 
open mind. 



Collegeboy, I'm a junior now 
and I'm getting tired of school. 
What can I do to make my classes 
more exciting? 

Maybe it's time to learn the an- 
cient art of scholastic swashbuck- 
ling from its undisputed master, 
Nathan Somers, crown prince of 
Slackdom. For a nominal fee. I will 
instruct a willing apprentice in the 
rewarding field of academic acro- 
batics. Become a slack-happy, devil- 
may-care slouchaboul! Learn to 
juggle five flaming term papers at 
once! Taunt your foes as you slice 
through busy-work and swing away 
to your next class on a conveniently 
placed rope.' Loot the treasure- 
laden galleons on the Spanish 101 
main! Just remember, what matters 
is not what you get out of a class, 
it's how little you have to put in. 

Mercifully, I rausi slop now. I 
crave Whoppers. My body's choco- 
late emergency rating is already ai 
WhoppcrCon 4. If I don't eat my 
own weight in mailed. parafTm-rich 
chocolate within the next hour I 
may become a threat lo world 
peace. Bui if you have any real 
questions lo ask mc. please keep 
Ihem to yourself. I've gol enough 
problems without reading some in- 
sipid letter from some whiny reader. 
If you absolutely have lo write 
something, cul oul each letter or 
word from magazines and make 
some vague Ihreat, Thank you and 
good night.
