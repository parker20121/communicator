JUGGLERS ORGANIZE 
NEW CLUB ON CAMPUS 

An organizational meeting will take 
place Sunday from 1:30 to 3 p.m. in 
Room 122 of the Gates Sports Center lo 
promote an inierest in juggling.

stitution and by-laws and choose a club 
name.

will be 10 learn and enhance juggling 
skills. Wilkins said there are many bene- 
fits to juggling. They include relaxation, 
eye-hand coordination, stress release, and 
rhythm. 

"The idea is to teach jugglers how to 
get more advanced, or lo learn how to do 
it in the first place. It is open lo everyone 
firom klutz to super-coordinated, and they 
should bring a friend," said Wilkins. 

Wilkins said so far about a dozen 
prospecdve club members have respond- 
ed, and he anticipates mors will show up

Student senator seeks dorms for IPFW campus 



By Sarah Jakacky 
Chief Reporter 

The feasibility of dorms on 
campus is being invcsiigated by 
IPSGA, according to Gregory 
Bracho, student affairs chair- 
man. 

Although the prospect of 
dorms is at least four years 
away, Bracho said it is "an 
opportunity lo give a good name 
lo student government and, of 
course, lo me as well." 

Bracho said a lot of time is 
necessary in collecting informa- 
tion for such a project First, he 
said IPSGA is trying to deter- 
mine how many students would 



live in a dorm if ihcy were 
available. 

Then the sialistics will be pre- 
sented 10 the IPFW adminisua- 
lion. They either approve or 
deny the request. Bracho said if 
IPF\V's administration docs not 
like the idea, IPSGA is prepared 
to go to the Purdue Board of 
Trustees. As a last resort, he 
said they will go to Indiana's 
General Assembly. 

According lo Craig Sleitncr, 
the IPSGA senator working on 
the dorm committee, there arc 
several reasons they are investi- 
gating ihc possibility of donns. 

Sieiiner said reasons include 



Ihe need for student housing. 
and the possibility of aiiraciing 
more siudcnis lo the area. 

To determine how many siu- 
denls would be inicrcsied in liv- 
ing in a dorm. IPSGA has began 

"This is an opportunity to 
give a good name to slu- 
dent government." 
-Gregory Bracho 

infomially polling students; So 
far results have been positive. 

Bracho said IPFW has about 
35 siudcnis from other coun- 
tries, and he predicts dorms 
would double thai number. 



However, only aboui 240 siu- 
dcnis come here from out of 
stale. He also reported the 170 
aihleics housed in Canterbury 
Green at IPFW's e:^pcnsc might 
benefit fromdomis also. 

Right now, according lo 
Bracho, ihc biggest problem is 
money. 

"One of the problems in gel- 
ling the money is ihai Purdue 
finances our money and ihey 
will not give it lo us easily. 
Another problem is that if we do 
build a dorm and if rooms arc 
left vacant, money will be lost," 
explained Bracho, 

Olhcr drawbacks, said 



Bracho, involve not knowing 
what faculty, the administration, 
and siudcnu favor, IPSGA will 
continue polling lo gain a broad- 
er perspective. 

Stellncr said ihe dorm issue 
must be seiilcd soon, though, 
because IPSGA is proposing lo 
build Ihc dorms west of campus 
across the river. 

"There is land in a trust that 
must be used by a certain dale, 
or the ownership will go back to 
ihc UTisiec" Sieilncr noicd. 

However, Bracho predicted at 
least a four year wait, along 
with a lot more research on ihc 
project.

EduCare update 

Child care task force 
explores new options 



By Mike Wade 
Managing Editor 

Although Lori Martin, unoffi- 
cial leader of ihe EduCare par- 
enis group, said a parent 
wouldn't be allowed lo partici- 
pate in the lask force lo study 
child care alicrnatives, Cheryl 
Cloyd. a student currenlly using 
the EduCare Center, was named 
to the task force on Oct 27. 

Frank Borelli, vice chancellor 
for student affairs, said he 
always planned on having a par- 
ent on the task force. 

"It was never my inieniion lo 
exclude IPRV par- 
ents. Some of the 
parents have 
formed a campus 
organization. I 
chose not lo sclecl 
a representative 
from their group," 
said Borelli. 

There arc two 
parents who used 
Ihe EduCare facili- 
ly on the task force. Cloyd is 
one, and Kim McDonald, assis- 
tant professor of organizational 
leadership and supervision, is 
another 

Students' govemmeni also has 
a rcpresenlative on the task 
force. Elben Webster, vice presi- 
dent of legislaiion, was appoint- 
cd to the task force. 

"At this point students' gov- 
ernment isn't really getting 
involved in the situation. Once 
Ihe task force makes clear the 
direction we'll be headed with 
child care, students' government 
will get involved," said Webster. 

Webster will serve on the task 
force as a Uaison with students' (, VdwCnrp naop 7

Athletics needs budget boost 
to keep programs above water 



By Sarah Jakacky 
Chief Reporter 

According lo Dan Gebhart. an 
athletic administrator, the stu- 
dent service fee increase is not a 
proposal, just an idea. 

Gebhart said the athletic 
department is facing several 
dilemmas. These exiemal rules 
are beyond ihc university's con- 
irol, and must be followed. 

One rule, which is federally 
mandated, is ihat 
women's sports 
receive ihe same 
amount of money 
as men's sports. 

Rule iwo involves 
gender equality. 
Female athletes 
must receive the 
same opportunities 
as male athletes. 
This is either man- 
dated by the federal government 
or NCAA. 

Another problem for the alh- 
leiic dcparuncni, Gebhart said, 
is thai ihcy arc dramatically 
underfunded. 

Examples of ways the athletic 
dcpanmcni is trying lo cut back, 
said Gebhart, is by slimming 
travel expenses. 

"Most of the lime the teams 






He said most schools do stay 
overnight, but IPFW cannot 
afford 10 do ii all the lime. 

When teams do slay ovemighi, 
adileies arc forced lo crowd four 
to a room, Gcbharl said they 
would like 10 keep thai numtier 
at two. 

A third problem the athletic 
department faces involves trav- 
elling expenses. Gebhan said 
when learns do travel, diey are 
allolted SI6a day. as 
opposed to ihe S24 
Olher schools allow. 

Another way 
funds are spent are 
when ihc teams trav- 
el beyond ihc mid-

The men's volley- 
ball team is the only 
sport thai must play 
teams beyond ihe tri- 
staie area. 

"IPFW icams have been to 
Canada. Massachusetts, Puerto 
Rico. Alaska. Texas. California, 
Virginia, and more. We have 
covered ihc couniry," Gebhari 
said. 

He added. "When we host 
teams from ihose places, they 
expeci you to come to play 
them. This helps to get ihe 
travel to and return from games IPFW name out there, and it will 
on ihe same day." explained - . , . ■ -r

Engineering and Technology Building 
nears completion; to open this spring 



By Mike Wade 
Managing Editor 

The firsi offices will move 
into the new Engineering and 
Technology Building by ihe 
end of next week, according to 
Don Katlcr. director of the 
Physical Plant. 

The finishing touches arc 
being put on ihc building. The 
building services siaff arc 
pulling locks on the doors, 
pulling in light fixtures, and 
cleaning the floors to gel ready 
10 move ihe furniture into the 
building, according to Katicr 

"Not all the fumiiurc is here 
yet. Wc tried to arrange deliv- 
ery to fit wiih our schedule." 
said Kaiicr 

Most of ihc classes moving 
into the new building will come 
from Ncff Hall, 

"At this poini wc are only 
moving offices into ihe new 
building. There won'i be any 
classes held iherc until 
January." said Kalicr, 

The classes will wail until 
next semester because ihe lab 
equipment is slill in Neff Hall, 
said Kalier. 

"Some of ihc labs have 
heavy equipment and machin- 
ery. It would be 100 much trou- 
ble to move the labs before 
winter break," said Kaiier, 

Kailer said ihc building 



would fill up from the lop floor 
down. 

■The first occupants will be 
the offices on Ihc third floor 
wiih engineering. We'll work 
down through ihc second floor

Dorms hinder students, 
foster dependence 



For ihc first time this year it is 
truly importani that the voice of 
[he student body be heard. Find 
lyoitr student senators and tell ttiem 
"NO" on the dorm issue. 

For many reasons, attempts to 
convcri IPFW into a residenlial 
campus arc misguided and of 
questionable intent. Dormitories 
on campus would be a disservice 
to the vast majority of IPFW's stu- 
dents. Most significantly, resi- 
dence halls are unnecessary, 

1. The vasi majority of IPFW's 
students live in apartments or sin- 
gle-ramily housing. Students that 
live on their own (also a vast 
majority, considering that the 
average IPFW student is approxi- 
mately 27 years old) will not want 
to fall back under the iron rule of 
the dormitory staff and campus 
police. 

Students living at home, while 
trading the iron rule of parents for 
the lc-';s stringent iron rule of the 
dormitory, are probably living at 
home and attending IPFW due to 
fiscal concerns. The high cost of 
residenlial campus life defeats this 
purpose. 

Students who want to live near 
the campus independently have a 
wealth of options already. Local 
apartments and other housing is 
priced competitively and readily 
available. 

Even out of state students will 
be taken for a ride. A student sen- 
ate survey of oui-of-state students 
Slated only iWd^rcent "may need 
housing." Even for out-of-staters, 
6n-canipus housing is coniraiy to 
the greater good of the campus 
community. 

The fiscal burden of building 
dorms will need to be repaid. With 
the high cost of building in the 
1990s, residenlial students will 
bear the burden of their choice. 
Dorm living will not be cheap. 

2. The attempt to consimci dormi- 
tory facilities will impede IPFW's 
ailcmpis to gain fiscal autonomy 



from Purdue University. 

The faculty senate and campus 
administration have undertaken a 
quest for fiscal autonomy. This 
quest is futile if the only goal is 
the construction of student dormi- 
lories on the Fort Wayne campus, 

Purdue, currently adding two 
new facilities to its residence hall 
system on the main campus in 
West Lafayette and at the mercy of 
state education budgets, will cer- 
tainly not fund a residence hall for 
a campus that it will soon be fis- 
cally separate from. Without their 
money, building dorms will not be 
easy, 

3. Residence hall living fosters 
dependence on others at a time 
when independence is an appre- 
ciable asset. Students dependent 
upon roommates, friends and the 
dormitory staff for food, company 
and counseling will never grow 
up. 

The addition of residence halls 
at IPFW would also result in 
greater insurance costs and legal 
difficulties for the campus. Discip- 
line, a great dormitory uadilion, 
would be nearly impossible in this 
environment. Convincing the 27 
year old average smdcni of the 
error of his ways when he drinks a 
beer in his room could be quile 
difficult. The long arm of the law 
would have to stretch to protect 
the denizens of ihc campus dormi- 
tories. Justifying residentialization 
is impossible. 

4, In conclusion, one must ques- 
tion the motives of the student 
senate in making the residential- 
ization of IPFW a senate priority. 
The needs of the student body and 
the goals of the student senate 
have taken divergent paths. It is up 
to the student body to make sure 
their interests are served. 

IPFW serves the community 
well in its current capacity. 
Changing this winning formula 
may be the biggest mistake we 
could ever make. 



ANOTHER VIEW 



Dorms lend respect 



When choosing a national uni- 
versity to attend there are many 
criteria for evaluation. Scaled on 
many of these factors, IPFW 
places well. 

IPFW has accredited and recog- 
nized academic programs in many 
fields including a world-class pro- 
gram in Geology. The academic 
campus draws from the finest pro- 
grams of two internationally rec- 
ognized universities. 

IPFW has a nationally revered 
sports team, a really cool mascot 
^d a bilchin' Gco-Cardcn. 
, We're one step from national 
recognition. 

RespecL 

Seven little letters that mean so 
much, IPFW don't get no respect, 
R-e-s-p-e-c-t. 

Respect is not easily earned and 
IPFW is a young campus. But we 
will never get the respect we 
deserve and long for until we 
become more than a commuter 
campus. 

Respect is the magic potion diat 



turns sheepskin into education. 
Respect is the mystical elixir that 
turns four years of education into 
a lifetime career. Respect makes 
those jokes about diis being a high 
school quite iircleveni. 

You are receiving a world-class 
education. Are you getting the 
respect you deserve for this 
accompUshment? 

Bursting out from under the 
heavy-handed treatment of the 
Purdue trustees is a start. Fiscal 
autonomy will bring IPFW 
respect. 

The addition of residence halls 
to the campus will bring this 
campus much of the respect it 
richly deserves. 

The label of "commuter cam- 
pus" undercuts what is being 
accomplished here. 

It's high lime to make your 
stand. It won't be easy and simple. 
Make your years worth those 
tears. Fight for the respect you 
deserve.

Financial faux pas 

Students ripped off by IPFW 



To Ihe Editor: 

Approximately three weeks ago an 
ariiclc appeared in ihe Fori Wayne 
News-SeniincI which stated that 
IPFW had agreed to donate campus 
land to be used to build a baseball 
complex. The baseball complex will 
be used by the city Parks Depart- 
ment and area high schools among 
others. 

1 must be confused. Isn't this the 
university that has been constantly 
complaining of lack of monies? 
Isn't IPFW the campus which can- 
not support a child care facility for 
want of funds? Is it nol this campus 
which refuses to pay ils faculty in 
parity with the main campuses of 
its sponsoring universities due to a 
lack of financial resources? 

Over ihe course of the past two 
years we have experienced unprece- 
dented increases in tuition, dimin- 
ished student services, and reduced 
or eliminated course offerings — all 
in the name of budgetary con- 
straints. In short, Ihe members of 
this community (customers) and the 
product of this business (educa- 



tion?) have been made to suffer 

while non-academic expenditures 
seem lo increase unabated. 

There have been no reductions in 
the number of administrators on our 
campus; in fact the number has 
increased. There seems to be no lack 
of funds for the purchase of Cush- 
man vehicles so that the 
groundskecping personnel and mail- 
room employees do not have to 

"Now ihis campus seems lo 
be so financially solvent thai 
land can be given away. 
"Mark Snyder 

walk between buildings while those 
who pay their salaries (students) are 
told that our gripes about the park- 
ing situation arc due to laziness. 
There seems to be funds to land- 
scape the campus and lay sod at the 
Fine Arts School so as to provide a 
■'green carpel" for Steven Beering, 
president of Purdue University, at 
the Fine Arts Building dedication. 
And now, this campus seems to be 



so financially solvent that land can 
be given away! 

While 1 heartily support and agree 
with Steve Hollander, professor of 
English, and the rest of the faculty 
senate that there is a need for this 
campus to be financially indepen- 
dent, future soludons do not absolve 
the members of this community 
from recognizing and addressing 
immediate injustices. Yet, the facul- 
ty and this newspaper have been 
silent on this most recent abuse of 
the members of Ihis community by 
ils administrators and governing 
university. 

Am I the only one who is tired of 
subsidizing recreation and a bur- 
geoning administration at the 
expense of education? 1 wonder how 
many of those students who experi- 
enced financial aid restrictions 
might be able to remain in school on 
the monies directed to non-academ- 
ic programs and departments? Oh 
well, it is just students so why 
should anyone give a damn!

EduCare 

pull-out 

illogical 

To the Editor; 

1PF\V has always been one of the 
hidden assets of Fort Wayne. The 
continued growdi of the university at 
this campus can only attest to the 
foresight and wisdom of the decision 
making bodies of Ihe university ot 
perhaps the growth reflects the high 
cost of higher education with many 
students unable to afford life on 
campus - cither Indiana University ■ 
or Purdue University. 

What did IPFW do to anger 130 ; 
children's parents - children who are 
withoutcareasof I&gt;ec. 31? On Aug. ! 
31, IPFW decided to terminate their 
part in the child care consortium, 
consisting of Parkview, IPFW, and 
IVY Tech. 

While 1 do understand the Univer- 
sity's need to have a sound fiscal 
program, I find their decision leaving 
many unanswered questions, 

1. How can a for-profit day-care 
just down ihc street continue to stay 
in busincs. 



Letter 
Of The 
Week 



Free love ' 

Sex part of well-being 



To the Editor: 

We arc responding to Marie 
Mersey's leiicr on "Free Love," from 
the Oct, 29 issue of The Communi- 
cator. 

Henry Home once said, "Ignorance 
is the mother of fear," Even though 
a college is an insiilute of learning 
and any unknown words can be 
looked up in a dictionary at Hclmke 
Library, we wilt try not to scare Ms. 
Herscy away by using words that 
contain more dian five letters. (But, 
that wasn't the issue anyway.) 

Afier consulting a dictionary, we 
found that free love is formally 
defined as, "die principle or practice 
of sexual relations unrestricted by 
marriage or other legal obligations." 
Free love is a lifestyle choice prac- 
ticed by some but forced on none. 
Monogamy and abstinence are also 
lifestyle choices. Choice is die key 
word here, Ms. Hersey. We are all 
free to choose our own lifestyle. Just 
as Greg Willson has probably 
learned by now, we do not have die 
right to condemn others for their dif- 
ferent lifestyle choices. 

We think it is wrong for you to 
blame a particular generation or 
social movement for all of die prob- 
lems that today's and future genera- 
tions will go through, STDs have 
been around for centuries. Neither 
STDs nor AtDS are caused by or arc 
limited to the promiscuous. Just like 
pregnancy, a disease can be obtained 



from merely one sexual encounier, 
promiscuous or not. 

As far as religion and belief are 
concerned, we are all free to have 
our own value and moral system, 
each being jusi as valued as die next. 
If we were to look lo our religious 
figures for guidance, we would have 
sexual role models like Jim Baker 
and Jimmy Swaggan. 

In our generation, sex serves many 
purposes - reprtxiuciion and physical 
gratification being just two exam- 
ples. Pan of the term "wellness" is 
being healthy in all areas of one's 
life; physically, emotionally, and so 
forth. And pari of die physical well- 
ness is satisfying the natural sex 
drive, if chosen, du-ough any number 
of sexual practices. Free love is used 
lo celebrate die beauty of sexual rela- 
tionships entered into by consenting 
adults, not criticized for being the 
cause of divorce and adultery. 

May we suggest that you lum your 
negative energy towards sexual rela- 
tions into a positive direction. 
Instead of criticizing or blaming oth- 
ers, be a part of die solution lo the 
problems that you speak of. Slop 
sharing your ignorance, which is pan 
of the problem, and slarl helping to 
educate yourself to the realities of 
sex. After all, if it weren't for sex, 
you wouldn't be here.

Editorials 
should be 
censored 

To the Editor: 

I don't want to take up a lot of space 
giving any more attention to Greg 
Willson, but I must make a point, 

I was appalled and disgusted to read 
his commentary which said, "...let |die 
homosexuals] go to California where 
most of die homosexuals are. Maybe 
we'll get lucky and they'll get AIDS 
and keel over," 

How can a person who claims to be 
so moral wish a long, painful dcadi on 
people he doesn't even know. People 
who he feels should die because they 
choose to love in a way he can't 
understand or refuses to Uy to under- 
stand. And how is it possible that it 
was even printed in a newspaper - a 
college newspaper at that. This is a 
comment I hear from backwards hill- 
billies, not educated individuals. Grow 
up is my advice. 

College is about learning about other 
people and accepting lifestyles unlike 
your own - having compassion for 
your fellow people. 

I'm also extremely upsei dial some- 
one even allowed this article lo be 
primed because it contains blatant dis- 
criminatory remarks which wouldn't 
have been printed if they had been 
about race. So to anyone involved, I 
give the advice of showing some 
respect and understanding towards 
your brodiers and sisters.

Guy Buenconsejo

"I don'l think it's neces- 
sary for IPFW to have

ever, it would be helpful

charging 
comparable 
rates lo the 
users as Edu- 
carc charged 
to studenis? 

2. The Edu- 
carc Center was only one year old 
when IPFW decided to withdraw. 
How could IPFW have conceived, 
designed and budi this beautiful new 
facility widioul knowing and antici- 
pating the costs? How can usage be 
an explanation, when there were 
many people on waiting lists at all 
times? 

3. IPFW's decision to withdraw 
was made on Aug. 31, - yet die stu- 
dents were not notified by mail until 
Octobers. How could die university 
place Parkview's needs to notify 
their teachers above their own stu- 
dents needs ■ information which 
would put most of ihe 100 parents 
inioacrisLsmodc? 

4. How can Ivy_Tcch manage lo 
maintain, dieir part in the child care 
facility when IPFW could not? Is it 
because Ivy Tech simply tried a liule 
harder? 

5. Did IPFW consider any other 
options to get financial aid such as 
the IPFW Foundation of die Helene 
Foellinger Foundation? 

6. Why weren't the students given 
an opportunity to respond lo this 
decision? Why weren't students giv- 
en an opponunity to use the facility 
full-time or to pay more? 

7. Did the IPFW student govern- 
ment contribute lo die student's use 
this year - and if so, can those 
monies be used to help set up anoth- 
er facility? 

8. The argument was raised that 
the facility needed to change to full- 
time student users to be more prof- 
itable. Yet the center was full from 8 
to 5 normally. How can a center 
which is full of pan-lime people be 
any more or less profitable than a 
ccnicr filled with full-umc people? 

How does the issue stand? On 
Thursday, Nov. 5 the fate of 130 
children without care will be at the 
mercy of the EduCarc Board of 
Directors, who will decide what 
usage IPFW will be able to retain, if 
any. We hope dial Parkview is more 
compassionate with families who arc 
trying to improve their lives and the 
lives of their children. 

This is nol jusi a women's issue. 
This is a family issue - the whole 
family is affected when daycare is 
no longer available. All types of 
families are going to be affected- 
single mothers raising children on 
their own, returning adults and even 
present or future faculty at IPFW. 

While not exclusively a women's 
issue this affects them most directly. 
Women who still find children their 
primary responsibility. Withdrawal 
which will result in women being 
unable to coniinue their education 
and their dreams. Continuing 
women in their role as a statistic for 
poveny. 

Authorities predict diai by the year 
2000, 86% of oil jobs will require 
post high-school training. We need 
to add programs that keep women in 
school and encourage and applaud 
their efforts and successes, 

1 am safe in assuming I will never 
know the answers to my questions - 
1 will be denied access. 

I used to think of IPFW as a hidden 
treasure - now it is an embarrass- 
ment lo all women.

lowed by a description of the CIA's 
historical role in Iran to illustrate how 
fiilLs can be misinformed and emotion- 
ally manipulated by media and govern- 
ment dcmagoguery- 

Whcn told by a Communicator staff 
member diat the letter was too long, I 
provided iiutructions on which parts lo 
axe. in an attempt to pare it down into 
a direct rebuttal to certain anonymous 
alScgalions made in The Communica- 
tor's coverage of Agee. Apparently a 
miscommunicalion occurred, because 
the rebuttal, which ran in the Nov. 5 
issue, retained live paragraphs on Iran 
and the U.S. media which I did not 
intend to include, and which had no 
direct tie in with the rest of the Icitcr in 
its abbreviated form. 

In the interest of clarity, I'd like to 
finish the diought which began in those 
misplaced paragraphs: 

If the mainstream media had provid- 
ed mc a more complete picture of 
Iran's history in 1979. my attitude 
toward the U.S. embassy occupation - 
i,c,i let's go bomb the bastards into the 
sionc age- would have been a bit less 
leactionary. 

In the early 1950s. Iran's democrali- 
cally elected government attempted to 
nationalize the country's oil reserves, 
which at that time were under die con- 
trol of British petroleum corporations. 
In response to this effort by Iran, lo 
control and benefit from its own 
resources, the British government cut a

CIA engineered a coup against Iran's 
Prime Minister Mossadegh in 1953, 



and installed Shah Rcza Pahlavi and 
Iran's royal diciator-for-lifc. In return.

who yearned lo breathe free. For thirty 
years, this extension of the CIA 
enforced dictatorial corporate rule 
through torture, murder and political 
imprisonment. 

In his book. "On the Run", Philip 
Agec described a scene aired on Dutch 
television, of a SAVAK torture center 
discovered in Tehran; "It was a base- 
ment with steel beds that had horizon- 
tal wire mesh at different levels. An 
Iranian was explaining that coal fires 
were started under the beds, and pris- 
oners were strapped to the mesh, then 
gradually lowered until they were bar- 
becued. At the end (of the film seg- 
ment) he held up two severed, charred 
human heads that torturers had left 
behind."

base of CIA operations in Iran, which 
supported the organization that com-

off both sides of the eight year war 
twtwecn Iran and Iraq. Jusl as certain 
unscrupulous industrialists profited 
during the American civil war — by 
selling arms to confederates and 
Unionists alike — these corporation! 
raked in tidy sums through arms sola 
and trades to Iran and Iraq. The addi- 
tional arms helped to prolong this con- 
flict, in which hundreds of thousandi 
of Iraqis died and an estimated one 
million Iranians, many of whom wen) 
active-combatant children. 

During the mid-cightics. while thii 
war raged, at least one company based 
in West Germany, our NATO ally, prof- 
ited by selling Iraq technology which 
could be used to manufacture ncrvo 
gas. West German technical expertise 
also helped the Iraqis boost tho flight 
range of their scud missiles. The U.S. 
government knew about many of these 
transattiuns. but they were not consid- 
ered priorities al the time when Iraq 
gassed lo death an estimated 20.000 
Kurds. TVirkey also has waged a geno- 
cide campaign against its own Kurdish 
minority, but since Turkey is a NATO 
member, its government's murderotis 
reprcs.sions have no propaganda value 
for the U.S. ruling elite's foreign agen- 
da, and little or no visibility in the U.S. 
media.

Mom juggles 
job, school 

By Judy Ramsey 
Starr Wrirer 
Dan Quaylc criticized Murphy 
Brown's lack of "family values" 
when she conceived and gave birth 
10 a baby boy out of wedlock. His 
primary objection lo this fictitious 
slory-linc was the omission of the 
husband, the father figure, the 
provider and protectoi of the new 
bom child. 

With iwo out of three marriages 
ending in divorce, an ever increasing 
number of teenage pregnancies, 
accidental deaths, and abandonment; 
many women fmd themselves thrust 
from the security and comfort of 
their homes and into the work force. 
These women must find ajob lo sup- 
port their families. 

Some of these women lack the 
skills, experience and education to 
acquire the better paying positions 
that might be available to them; eon- 
sequenlly. ihcy end up employed in 
low paying, service type positions, 
struggling to make ends meet. 

Eventually, some women return to 
college intent on earning a college 
degree as a means by which they can 
improve their employment status. 

According to IPFW's statistical 
profile, 55 percent of IPFW's stu- 
dents last year were women. 

IPFW student Dcdra Sing supports 
herself and her eight month old 
daughter, Desiree, by working full 
lime ai the Vincent House as an 
administrative associate. 

The Vincent House provides a 
place for the homeless and serves as 
a transition to allow individuals a 
smoother transition from homeless- 
ness to being part of the workforce. 

"I'm responsible for arranging 
workshops to increase awareness of 
multi-cultural education, in the 
workplace, of social service 
providers." Sing said. 

Two months after the birth of her 
daughter. Sing decided to return to 
college to earn a master's degree. 
Even though Sing holds a bachelor's 
dcgreft in edijcalidn from'ihc'UfiTvaf-

Support network 
helps parents 

By Judy Ramsey 
StafrWriter 

Linda Johnson, coordinator of the 
Center for Women and Returning 
Adults, works with women on a one* 
on-one basis, helping them get going 
at IPFW. Johnson helps them with 
undersunding their individual per- 
sonality traits, goal setting, class 
enrollment, and provides them with 
pertinent informadon concerning the 
various financial aid resources avail- 
able to them here. 

The women who exemplify the 
strongest commitment to succeed in 
college are motivated by their chil- 
dren and their family's well being, 
Johnson said. 

Having a strong support network 
helps women deal with the pressure 
of working full time, raising children 
alone and going back to school. The 
Indiana Displaced Homemakers Net- 
work works with single parents and 
displaced homemakers, IDHN pro- 
vides individual counseling, career 
assessment, workshops and the 
names of various financial sources. 

The IDHN office is located at 303 
E, Washington Blvd. in Fori Wayne. 
For further information about the 
IDHN, call 424-7977. 



about going on welfare. 

"I don't want the government to 
suppon me and my child," Sing stat- 
ed with strong convictions. 

Sing leaves her daughter with a 
friend during the day and with a 
paternal grandmother in the evenings 
while she is at school. Sing tries to 
organize her schedule so she has 
time to spend time with her daugh- 
ter. She says she is an over-achiever 
who is very self- motivated. 

After graduating from IFPW, Sing 
hopes to become the executive direc- 
tor at the Vincent House, go into pri- 
vate practice, or gel a job as a school 
counselor. Whatever she chooses. 
Sing has decided she will open and 
run a shelter some day. 

"Learn how to love yourself You 
come first. Don't ever think you 
■can't do "it alone. Don'twailow iff 
self-pity,'" I I I - I, I 



Sing lives by these words on a 
day-to-day basis as she copes with 
the knowledge thai her daughter is 
terminally ill and needs a liver trans- 
plant before her first birthday. To 
offset the 5250,000 expense for this 
operation, Sing has initiated a fund 
raiser selling raffle tickets. The first 
prize will be a holiday basket cooked 
to order. In the meantime. Sing 
focuses on the positive and remains 
optimistic about the future. 

When asked for some encouraging 
words for fellow students who are 
single parents struggling to balance 
work, family and school Sing says, 
"It's okay to cry. I cry all the time." 
She stopped for a moment and then 
added, "If you need help, ask for it!"

Grand Slam USA offers year-round fun 



By J. William Richardson 
Copy Editor 

While Fori Wayne gets 
drenched under a constant win- 
ter driz/le, local baseball fans 
don't miss a beat. Thanks to 
Grand Slam U.S.A.. devotees 
of the national pastime can get 
their baseball fix year round. 

"We really are providing a 
community service," said Olin 
Wiland. co-owner of the year- 
round spons center located on 
709 Ley Road. "I never 
dreamed it would end up like 
this." 

Wiland, a CPA until last 
June, took the plunge and 
jumped into a burgeoning new 
enteqirise. "It was a big risk," 
said Wiland. "I checked into it 
and found out what the local 
market for this kind of place 
would be and then we went for 
it. We saw that there weren't 
enough batting cages in the 
area." 

Four computer-controlled 
baiting cages and one indoor 
basketball court later, Wiland 
can see his dream taking shape. 

"If you look at my business 



plan and look at where we're at 
today, you'll see we've made it 
to the end," said Wiland, "but 
we got there in a different way 
than 1 could imagine." 



and will sign autographs 
before and after the event. 

"George Foster has been here 
three times," said Wiland. 
"He's given a lot of instruction 



Fort Wayne's Grand Slam during his visits.' 

U.S.A., part of a national chain Foster, who is a spokesman 

of over 90 locations, was for the national franchise, was 

named 1991's Outstanding an outfielder for the 



New Franchise by 
ATEC, the parent 
company of the 
chain. 

Wiland and partner 
Claude Hale, have 
developed Grand 
Slam into much 
more than a batting 
cage. Hilling 

instruction is 

offered year-round. 
in addition to sever-

the works with the

"Our busy season really runs

"People want to come in and 
get ready for next season." 

The complex also offers 
birthday party plans including 
food, fun and a birthday cake. 

Grand Slam's batting cages 
are state-of-the-art, and 
designed and produced by 
ATEC for major league fran- 
chises. 

Grand Slam's pro shop offers 
products from Louisville 
Slugger, Easton, Mizuno and 
others. 

"We have fitted caps and 
minor-league caps coming in," 
said Wiland. "We are expand- 
ing our pro shop and team 
sales." 

Baseball isn't all they offer 

"The basketball court is real- 
ly full on the weekends during 
the winter," said McCrory. 
"You need to call in advance to 
get reservations." 

The basketball court features 
adjustable backboards 

designed to give die "air-less" 
some hang time.

Sega raises level of video thrills with 
new Joe Montana football game 



By J. William Richardson 
Copy Editor 

Recem releases from many of Ihe 
major players in the videogame 
indusiry have upped ihe anic in ihe 
spons simulation videogame market. 

Joe Montana NFL SportsTalk 
Football *93 for ihe Sega Genesis 
Sysiem represenis a major step for- 
ward in ihe realism, preseniaiion and 
cnicnainmcni value of spons 
videogames. 

SponsTalk '93 (available ai local 
toy siores for around S60.00) is the 
ihird Joe Moniana Football release 
from Sega. While the firsi two Joes 
each were groundbreaking in icrms of 
gam ep lay and preseniaiion, pan three 
goes one beiier by pcrfcciing ihe 
sirong points of its predecessors 
while adding a few new features of 
its own. 

Joe Montana Football, released by 
Sega jusi after the introduction of the 
l6-bii Genesis sysiem. was a radical 
departure from its 8-bii predecessors, 
displaying the game from the view of 
the quarterback in many instances, 
not unlike ihe USA network's 
HelmetCam. 

Unfortunately, the original Joe was 
hard 10 play due to this feature and 
oiher idiosyncrasies and was replaced 
in 1991 by Joe Montana SponsTalk 
Football. 

The original SponsTalk was sloppy 
and mechanical in its game update 
commentary, but cleaned up many 
aspects of the overall presentation of 
the football game, zoommg in on run- 
ning backs and receivers after they 
caught the ball, Joe II was less suc- 
cessful in presenting the passing 
game, with receivers vanishing from 
view after getting about 20 yards 
from the line of scrimmage. 

While the real-time play-by-play in 
Joe Montana 11 was choppy and 
inconsistent, SponsTalk '93 smoothes 
out the speech and applies it more 
rclevcntly. 

The most obvious additions to the 
game arc the team names and logos 
of Ihe 28 National Football League 



franchises. This licensing adds lo the 
realism of the game, allowing players 
10 plot the running game of the 
Steelcrs against the wide open 
offense of the Oilers, for example. 

Each of the teams has special plays 
designed to simulate the team's actual 
offense. The Atlanta Falcons have 
several "Run and Shoot" plays, with 
receivers adjusting their routes 
according lo the defenses they face, 
simulating Jerry Glanvillc's "Red 
Gun" offense. 

New views of the action have also 
been added, allowing the player lo 
view the game noi only from the 

Game 
Review 

standard horizontal perspective but 
from either end zone or a special 
camera in a blimp above the stadium. 

Running plays are still difficult (o 
execute and most end at the line of 
scrimmage. The offensive line makes 
more tackles on rxinning plays up the 
middle than the defense does. Sweeps 
and plays where the down linemen 
pull are usually more successful. 

Passing is easier in Montana '93 
thanks lo the blimp cam. Open 
receivers arc easily spoiled in ihis 
camera angle. 

Defense is impossible from the 
blimp view and is difficult all the 
way around. Picking defenses is bet- 
ter left to the experts and really clogs 
up the flow of the game. 

Overall, the graphics and sound are 
improved, owing more to the NFL 
licensing than to the programmers. 
The Vikings just took belter in pur- 
pic. 

Joe Montana SponsTalk Football 
'93 does set a new standard in foot- 
ball simulations but don't go out and 
plunk dov^ your wallet, yei. 

John Madden Football '93 is 
expected to be released before 
Christmas and should give Montana 
the siiffcst of competition.

places besides Indiana lo have 
a degree here." 

Gebharl said if they do not 
find a way to bring in addition- 
al revenues, cutbacks will be 
detrimental to the entire dcpan- 
mcnL 

Gebhan speculated it may 
come to axing 
teams altogeth- 
er. IPFW car- 
ries 12 teams, 
but is only 
required to sup- 
port eight - 
four for men. 
four for 

women. 

Last spring, 
the athletic 
dcpartme nt 
came up with a 
plan. Gebharl 
said the plan 
involved ways 
to increase the 
collegiate 
sports. to 

expand the 
facilities, to 
broaden administration, and to 
fatten up the endowment. 

Although SI. 5 million was 
just raised for scholarships by 
the athletic dcparimeni, 
Gebhan said that money can 
not be used for anything else. 
The funds are limited and can 
not overlap into other areas. 

Gebhan said the central prob- 
lem is the dcpariment's short- 
age of funds. 

"The main crux of the prob- 
lem is the student activity fee. 
We can either raise our income, 
or we can cut spons. The plan 
we discussed with student gov- 
ernment is to raise fees. We 
want to resolve the problem 
before it gets to culling sports," 




Junior Brian Dumford gets his 
money's worth at Ihe Athletic 
Center. Photo by Troy 
Edgington. 



Gebhan explained. 

Misconceptions of the athletic 
department's mission have 
resulted in too much publicity, 
Gebhan added. "We arc not 
cutting student government. 
The increases we have dis- 
cussed would bring [hem more 
money. Also, we arc not out lo 
gouge students. We're here to 
provide better 
facilities for 
the students," 
noicd Gebhan, 
Gebhan said 
the answers 
aren't raising 
concess i o n 
prices, solicit- 
ing the public. 
nor fundrais- 
ing. 

"Concessions 
just won't raise 
the kind of 
money we 
need, and we 
don't want to 
go to the public 
for support 
because these 
facilities are 
for the students," he added. 

However, he said athletes reg- 
ularly panicipate in fundraisers 
to raise dollars. 

This alone will not bring in 
enough cash either. 

Although Gebharl said they 
are only discussing generalities 
right now, they are not willing 
to share their pnDposals jusi ycL 
He added they have released 
only a small ponion of the plan, 
and will keep it a secret until 
all the plans are finalized. 

Gebhan noted the Tinal deci- 
sions of how money is spent 
and divided remains with the 
tnjstees. not IPFW or student 
government.

in die last w seconds of the game 
pui a ptcmaiure end to ihe 
Masiodons. 

The Maslodons won 21 of 28 
games, wiih 12 of ihcse in the 
GLVC. selling school records for 
games won overall, and wins in the 
GLVC. 

However, a couple of defeats dur- 
ing the rest of the season forced 
IPFW to win its final two games lo 
qualify for the loumamcnL 

Eight players, including three 
starters, were part of the 1991-1992 
season's team, and bring the lesson 
of needing consistency to this year's 
squad. 

The most important facet these 
eight players bring though, is an 
extraordinary amount of playing 
experience. 

Sean Gibson, a two-time All- 
GLVC player and honorable mention 
All-Amcrican. leads the three return- 
ing starters in the center. Gibson has 
already established the career 
rebounding record at IPFW during 
last season. 

Another senior, Andre Walton, 
started 21 of 28 games as point 
guard and ranked among the GLVC 
leaders in assists. 

Junior JelT Smiihcy ranked second 
on the club in assists, and hit 25 
dirce-point shots in his starting role 
last season, 

Odier retuniing players with expe- 
rience include Shane Gibson and 
Lan Bullard at the small forward 
position. 



John Hohnstrcitcr, Pat Murphy, 
and Doug Reincke, all returning 
seniors. Join Sean Gibson in the mid- 
dle. The three players combined to 
average 17 points and nine rebounds 
last season. 

This experience and depth netted 
Ihc Maslodons a second place rank- 
ing in both The Sporis Information 
Directors' Poll. 

The weaknesses arc much fewer 
than the strengths of this team, but 
according to head coach, Andy 
Piaz/a, they do exist- 

"With four new kids, and two play- 
ers who sat out last season, wc need 
team chemistry with the new play- 
ers, "Piaz7.a said. 

Adding to this weakness is the 
injuries the team has sustained 
including Tony Martin, who sat out 
last season with an injury, and Doug 
Reincke, who has a stress fracture. 

With these injuries, and the one- 
game suspensions of three players 
for participating in an unauthorized 
basketball tournament over the sum- 
mer. Piazza expects the team's new 
players to contribute substantially 
early on. 

Scott Simmons, a junior, newcom- 
er, is expected to contribute as an 
outside shooter, a position Piaz/.a 
has doubts about due to the gradua- 
tion of sharpshooters Duanc Shears 
and Clarence Rich. Tom Patterson is 
also expected to step into the wing 
position, and conuribute to the out- 
side shooting game. 

The team's only freshman, K.C. 
Runyan, should sec time on die post 
with Reincke's injury and Sean 
Gibson's suspension. 

A Division I transfer from 
Southwest Texas State, Russ 
Maicinek has a badly sprained ankle, 
but is expected to heal quickly. 

Rounding out the 16-man roster is 
two walk-ons that earned a spot in 
the pre-scason tryouts Piazza held. 

Both players bring height to the 
post with Chad North of Bishop 
Lucrs at 6' 9" and Ethan Birch from 
Columbia City at 6' 7". 

Overall the team appears very 
strong, as noted by the high rankings 
in the GLVC pre-season polls. 
Kentucky Wesleyan is picked to fin- 
ish in the top spot in the GLVC. but 
Piazza believes IPFW has a strong 
chance to beat Uiem. 

"When I first came to IPFW 
Wesleyan was beating IPFW by 30 
or 40 points and winning National 
Championships. Meanwhile, IPFW 
was losing twenty games a season," 
Piazza said.

"Now wc lose by only a few 
points," Piazza said. Kentucky 
Wesleyan has defeated IPFW 17 
consecutive limes. 

"Wc have a very mature team, ;md 
are able to handle injuries and sus- 
pensions. Morale has not been 
hurt," Piazza said. The Mastodons 
have a combined 23 years of college 
experience on their 16-man roster. 

The Mastodons began their season 
with a Nov. 20 exhibition game at 
the Gates Sports Cenler against the 
Cook Institution AAU team. The 
game begins at 7:30 and pits IPFNV 
against the AAU team of former 
Indiana University and Indiana State 
players. 

These players include Jamaal 
Mceks, Eddie bird, and Scott May. 

Piazza enters his sixth season with 
IPFW and has a 66 percent winning 
percentage. Piazza has won at least 
20 games in the last three of four 
seasons. 

"I hope this is die season wc win. 
Wc have a veteran team with all the 
ingredients. Wc are this close to 
grcamess," Piazza said.
