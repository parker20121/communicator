IPSGA candidates define issues of upcoming election 



and Ramans Mcgnwn 
Editor In chief 

As many students are already aware, 
the IPSGA elections ore just around the 
corner. They will lake place in the 
basement of Kcltlcr starting Monday, 
April 18, and continue through Friday 
noon. April 22. 

Mark King is running for president 
of the student body and be has outlined 
hie goals for the fall semester, 

"I want to rebuild the student gov- 
ernment and try to improve its reputa- 
tion to tbe faculty, as well as becoming 
more familiar lo Ibc students here on 
campus." slated King. 

King is currently vice president of 
legislation and has been involved with 
the student government over the past 
two years. 

Mike lliii who is running for vice 



president of finance, c 
would like to create l 
services on campus, 

'1 would like to c 
care service here o 
would also like to ere 



nented thai he 
nc more student 

lie a good child

i legal service. 



' This would have a lawyer c 
give advice to students on different 
issues such as bow lo register, what 



happens in a divorce siluaiion, and 
other things thai would help students 
ice whal their options are in life con- 
cerning the law " 

Many students are curious about 
whether IPFW will actually carry out a 
plan on the proposed idea of dorms here 
on campus. 

The new candidates bad mixed 
views concerning this issue. 

Dave Bowman, who is running for a 
scat in the senate, expressed his views 
concerning the idea of dorms. 

"I feel that dorms ore necessary, I 
myself live in Huntington and must 
drive to Fort Wayne for school every- 
day. It is bard to find the means to 
afford an apartment here in town unless 
you arc able lo go full time to both 
work and school." 

John Young, also a candidate for the 
scnale, disagreed with Bowman. 

"I do not feel that dorms are neces- 
sary because most of tbe students live 
around the community. I would rather 
see Ihe money spenl on upgrading the 
teachers here at IPFW" 

Jerry Richardson, who is currently 
tbe student body president, has opted to 
run for the senate in the upcoming elec-

Countdown to new 
management agreement 



by Jo Ann Stcinforth 
News Editor 

Will IPFW achieve aulonomy when 

i current management agreement 

is out in 1998? 

The Management Agreement 
signed by the Board of Trustees and 
the president of Indiana University, 
Thomas Ehrlich, and Purdue President 
Stephen Becring, was signed last June 
and is in effect for five years until 
1998, This agreement mandates Purdue 
to be the fiscal agent for IPFW, 

Its up lo Purdue how much auton- 
omy they will give us," said Waller P. 
Hclmkc, chair of Ihe former Fori 
Wayne Chancellor Selection Advisory 
Committee. 

"Who knows whal Ihe future will 
bring," sold Hclmkc 

"I would like a fiscal agent to be 

tablishcd on campus lo handle the 

affairs of both 



Ihe IPFW campus. 

"He (Becring) is interested in ■ 
rising control. It would he better off if 
he would nol Iry lo conlol this i 
pus," said Downs. "Beering's n 
ogemenl style is back in Theory X and 
(he rest of the world is in Theory Y. 
said Patrick J. Ashlon. associate pre 
fessor of sociology and anlhropology, 

Douglas McGregor's book, "The 
Human Side of Enterprise" describes 
Ihe motivational theories of Theory X 
and Theory Y. 

Olher administrative issues that fac 
ulty members feel are unfair are (hi 
mandatory fees charged by (he Purdui 
Alumni Associaiion. 

Fees that Purdue Lake off the lop 
from IPFW administrative affairs are 
estimated lo be over half a million. 

"Purdue runs most of the payroll, 
maybe we could do it at a lower cost 




Last week's issue of the 
Communicator reported on Beering's 
March 7 letter, which was addressed to 
Helmkc and read at tbe March 21 min- 
of the Fort Wayne Senate meeting. 
A portion of the text staled, "Thank

of (he faculty being "dismissed" 
by Julius Smuikstys' statement. 'T pro- 
pose thai this body disapprove of 
President Beering's action terminating 
earch committee's activities in 
violation of Ibis campus's traditions."

student latent here on campus dis- 
played, and I would especially like lo 
try lo attract a major concert here at 
IPFW." 

Linder describes herself as hard- 
working and innovative, and would like 
lo be (he president of the student body 
someday. 

Jeff Valdez is running for a spot in 
be scnale and stressed the need for stu- 
lents to become aware of IPFW's 
esourccs, "We need to work lo adver- 
ise more lo ihe students whal is avail- 
ible lo tbem. I would especially like Lo 
work on improving the freshman orien-

Valdez also feels thai new campus

Most of (he candidates are running

dents arc vying for (he position for vice 
president of legislation. The iwo candi- 
dates, Chris Douse and Amy Siccnman, 



both have experience in the senale and 
mutual respect Tor each other. 

Douse stresses thai he wants child 
care facilities and would like to see 
more students of color on campus. 
Douse also feels that dorms ore neces- 
sary if you want the campus lo grow in 

positive direction. 

Stcenman wants to attract mom Stu- 
dent input and feels thai dorms at this 
poim are no( necessary because most of 
Lbe student* commute here. 

Douse, who considers himself to be 
a moderate, staled some of his qualifi- 

"I have been in the senale for iwo 
years which gives me an experience 
advantage, and 1 feel thai I posies* 

good leadership abilities for (he student 
body as a whole," 

Sleenman believes her qualifications 
also make her a strong candidate. 

"I have been a senator in the student 
body government and I am also a busi- 
ness major. I have decided to be active 
in the student body government because 

1 did not like the way things were and I 
wanted lo do something about it."

elections are quickly arriving . Most 
j Indents ore very eager to jump on the 
band wagon and criticize student gov-

may have legitimate complaints, they 
often remain apathetic and do not par-

Older students will say that Ibey

those situations do not concern them. 
Yet if tuition is raised or student fees 
are raised, it almost certain that these 
students will complain. 



It is up to Ibc students body as a 
whole to make sure that the persons 
elected to the student government be 
held accountable for both their deci- 
sions and behavior. 

Student government dealt with over 
S3I3.746 in 1993 and 5198,800 of 
those funds were student service fees

Christian feels 
misrepresented 

To the editor 

I strongly advise you to take a 
good English class, specifically 
English W233 because your writing 
style is alarmingly atrocious. First you 
too often compare DIAMONDS AND 
KETCHUP! Secood, the lone of voice 
in your articles is too scary for me- — 
I'd rather read Snoopy. "Hypocrisy 
Often Lies Within Christianiy" is truly 
the most unscholarly. hateful and 
worst piece of work 1 have read in the 
Communicator. You bave insulted and 
defamed and given us Christians a bad 
image. HOW DARE YOU, MR. 
DOUSE! I DEMAND AN APOLO- 
GY!!! I DEMAND THAT YOU 
WATCH YOUR STATEMENTS 
BECAUSE YOU ARE INSULTING 
YOUR AUDIENCE. BEING VERY 
UNTACTFUL AND WORST OF 
ALL REPRESENTING OUR 
SCHOOL THROUGH THE NEWS- 
PAPER! 

Certainly. I see Christian hyp. 
ocrites everyday. For example — 
Sunday Christians; These people go to 
mass on Sunday singing, going to 
Holy Communion, calling themselves 
Christians, parading everywhere in the 
name of the Father, claiming to be 
pious while the other six days of the 
week they sin with the excuse of "If 
everyone is doing it, why can't I?" 
Believe me. the Church disapproves of 
tbis and is trying to fix it. These 
Christians are whay my pal Amy 
Krach calls"... the few bad apples 
spoiling the whole barrel." 

I need to make a confession: I am a 
sinner. I sin everyday of my life with 
or without knowing it and I can not 
stop it. Knowing that I will never be 
perfect motivates me to follow God 
everyday. I am happy to know that I 
can go to confession, God loves me, 
God said that everything He made is 
precious. He will forgive me, the Holy 
Spirit will guide me and bave Jesus 
Christ to follow. 

I will be brief in correcting your 
worst mistakes Your main theme 
throughout die essay was to JUDGE 
the mistakes of past and present of 
Christianity. You said that 

"... Christianity has become the 

most effective tool in controlling peo- 
ple's actions, emotions, morals, and 
values." Worst of all, you JUDGED 
groups of Christians even though you 
said that judging others is a sin. Tell 
me. why did you play God yourself 
and JUDGE? And by the way. are 
you a CHRISTIAN? 

Gregory Bracho 



To the editor 

Last week, Fred Douse used EPFW's 
current ottempt at a newspaper to offer 
his views on what he called an "acci- 
dent" involving an African -American 
man, a gun. and six dead people. 

Douse, the features editor of The 
Communicator, writes a weekly politi- 
cal column that appears on the 
"Features" page. 

The man Douse wrote of. Colin 
Ferguson, injured 19 commuter-train 
passengers and killed six last Dec. 6 in 
East Meadow, New York. He gunned- 
down innocent Asian and while people 
And Douse believes Ferguson was jus- 
tified in these actions. 

Douse wrote: '1 see a political state- 
ment being made, I sec an African- 
American man who is no longer going 
to tolerate the unfair, in humane (sic) 
treatment of people of color no more 
(sic)," He continued. "If I had to put it 
into one statement, I would say. "The 
hunting season on jungle bunnies is no 
longer in season. Now the prey is going 
after the predator." 

Douse continued to ramble on 
throughout bis column about such 
things as the shooting victims now 
being able to understand what it's like 
for blacks who suffer from "a lack of 
respect for the lives .of African- 
American people in this country thai 
was founded on Christian values." And 
he noted "I don't feel like this man 
(Ferguson) was showing a disregard for 
life. He was just expressing his outrage 
at the condition of black folk in 
America..." 

Maybe Douse believes murder 
should be legal under the First 
Amendment right to freedom of politi- 
cal expression. 

Douse might also believe Colin 
Ferguson's rifle blast was his way of 
saying "enough is enough ." But I don't 



think this is a correct assumption. Last 
week, Ferguson spoke to reporters and 
told them he's not a racist. Ferguson 
said. "It destroys the very fiber of your 
being, any kind of hale based on race." 
Ferguson went on to add. "I have no 
hostility toward anyone." But he did 
kill six people, hurt 19. 

According to an AP report, 
Ferguson was carrying notes with bim 
during the shootings. In these notes he 
expressed hatred for white, Asians, and 
"Uncle Tom Negroes." It is quite obvi- 
ous that Ferguson is confused and quite 
ill. Douse argued that Ferguson was not 
"sick and demented" when he shot the 
train passengers. Douse argued, instead, 
that Ferguson was making a "political 
statement." 

If Ferguson was making a political 
statement, then why did be shoot peo- 
ple he did not know? Why did he sboot 
Asian people? I don't remember hear- 
ing of any time in history that Asian 
people suppressed African people or 
people of African decent. 

When be was blasting away white 
people did be kill whites who were 
married to black spouses? Did be kill 
white people ( and there are many) who 
bave dedicated their lives to fighting 
racism? Did he kill the people who 
appeared to be "white" but caise from 
multi-racial parents? 

I don't believe Ferguson considered 
these possibilities as he was squeezing 
off gun-shots. And I don'l think Douse 
considered these possibilities when he 
wrote this horrible column justifying 
this mass murder as a "political slale- 

If an African -American person real- 
ly wants to make a bold, brash and 
bloody poll tic al statement about racism, 
then that person should sboot a Ku 
Klux Klan member. That person should 
walk out into the street and shoot down 



those hooded bastards as they march. 
That action would be absolutely wrong. 
immoral, and would probably do more 
harm lhan good, but it would be a polit- 
ical statement- The shooter would actu- 
ally be saying "enough is enough." 

That's the chance a Klap member 
takes when he decides to march. That's 
not the chance innocent people riding 
to work in a commuter train should be 
forced to i.ikt 

When Douse finally finished his 
fact-free and error-riddled racist ram- 
bling, he concluded that race-related 
violence in society could be cased by 
"Maybe taking a stand for a cause. A 
cause in which we don't ask just look 
out for ourselves but a cause in which 
we look out for the human race as n 
whole." This from the same person who 
called Colin Ferguson a man who made 
a "political statement" Douse seems to 
be just as confused as Ferguson. 

But Douse was almost on base with 
this final statement. 

I believe, if we wont to ease race- 
related violence, we need to stop trying 
to divide people into block and white, 
into good and bad. Wc need to stop 
separating human beings into stereo- 
types, into boxes, into categories. We 
need to stop paying so much attention 
to gender, race or sexual orientation, 
and instead pay attention to people as 
individuals who all deserve completely 
equal rights. 

And opinion leaders working at our 
universities, in the media and even oth- 
ers like Douse, who somehow stumble 
into positions that allow ibem to broad- 
cast their ill-formed opinions, should 
all be careful about wbat they write or 
say. They should be careful not to call 
other people racist, sexist or homopho- 
bic while spouting the same sort of bale 
right out the other side of their mouths. 
Jim Walker IPFW student 



Student provoked to write 



Dear Communicator, 

During my five years as a student at 
IPFW, I have never felt the urge to 
write a letter to this paper There have 
been some good and bad articles, items 
with which I bave agreed and dis- 
agreed. But never have I fell the need to 
respond to an item in the 
Communicator -until 1 read the March 
24. 1994 issue. 

There were two articles in this issue 
of the Communicator that pushed me 
over the edge. The first was "A Dose of 
Douse" on page 4. This article is writ- 
ten by a man that has tried to show 
week in and week out that be is against 
racism Well, I got news for you, Mr. 
Douse. Whether you realize it or not, 
you yourself ire a racist! Anyone who 
could honestly say that it is justifiable 



for a man to shoot and kill another man 
simply because his is black and is 
"expressing his outrage at the condition 
of black folk in America" is a racist 
You may think that it is impossible for 
a black person to be racist, but that is 
exactly what this is — racism. Anytime a 
person is violent toward others simply 
because they have a different color 
skin, that person is a racist, and so is 
anyone who condones it. 

The second item that angered me 
was the phony "Aunt Louise" article. 
And lets face it, we all know this article 
is phony, no one writes to Aunt Louise 
because she has no mailing address. So 
what was the point of this stupid note 
from "While Man Who Wants a 
Month"? Was it to somehow legitimize 



this whole issue by showing that even a 
wrinkled old woman agrees with you? 
It doesn't really matter. The point is the 
response is just as racist as the phony 
letter. "White men are the reason this 
country is in the rut it is today "77? 
How can you print such a racist remark 
and follow it up with the words 
"FIGHT RACISM" in big. bold print? 
How about practicing what we preach? 
Mr, Douse ended his article by say- 
ing we could end racism by "taking a 
stand for a cause in which wc don't just 
look out for ourselves, but a cause in 
which we look out for the human race 
as a whole." Those are some profound, 
intelligent words. Think about them, 
(hen start practicing what you preach.

Native American 
upset with cartoon 



To the Edilor 

On March 17, 1994 a cartoon 
appeared in the Communicator. I found 
this cartoon to be in poor taste and 
offensive. Being an American Indian 
this cartoon hurt my heart. 

The government chose lo put my 
people on a Reservation thus destroying 
a way of life that had been going on 



successfully for many years. They sure 
didn't do the Indians any favors by giv- 
ing them Reservations.

Is romance essential in a working marriage? 



hy Krbik Schulundt 
Copy Editor 

Sociologiita lay thai 95 percent of 
U S citizen* the age of 65 or older 
ii ive tried marriage at Icail once:. 
While divorce rale* in this country 
rapidly ascended and reached a peak in 
the 80*. ihe rate! have unce dug into 
thai mountain top and ileadfastly 
refused u&gt; come down. We might well 
wonder why 

I did a litUe research of my own. It 
teems that divorce rates remain high 
because we keep marrying despite (he 
overwhelming evidence thai marriage 
Is a no-win tituation — despite the fact 
(but accepting a marriage proposal is 
roughly akin lo giving someone per- 
mission to suck your soul out through 
your nose. Oul of the fix married cou- 
ples ] interviewed, the 12 individuals — 
all under the age of 50— had a total of 
25 marriages between them. 

"You mighi soy I'm n fool for 
love," a five-lime veteran of ihe holy 
increment lold me, "or just a fool," she 
laughed. 

I've been married for five long 
years, which is certainly long enough to 
begin lo wonder: why did I do this 
foolish Ihing? 

I asked my husband, "John, why did 
we gel mairiedT' 

"I have to mow the lawn," he 
answered, heading for the front door. 

"There's still snow on the ground." 
I pointed oul. 

"So I'll shovel, then mow," John 
said as he ducked out the door. 

Except for my husband who, as I've 
indicated, refused lo aid me in my 
research, all of those interviewed 
claimed they get married each lime 
because Ihcy "'fell in love." 

What is the origin of marriage based 
on romantic love? At least since the 

acknowledged a strong emotional 
attraction that develops between iwo 
people and closely resembles obses- 
sion. The ancient Greeks believed such 
emotion was a malady that addled the 
brains of star-crossed lovers. 

Other cultures, too, past and pre- 



potcntially dangerous, socially radical 
and politically subversive— but not 
Americans. No. Americans seem to 
have an unnatural obsession with— 
well, unnatural obsessions. You might 
■ay romanticism Is an American institu- 
tion 

There was a time, ihougb, when 
marriage was not a matter of choice for 
ihe individuals to be married- It was ■ 
choice to be made by the families of 
Ihe betrothed, families thai look such 
weighty mailers as malerial wealth, 
social position and reproductive poten- 
tial into consideration rather than mere 
feelings. Such limitation of personal 
freedom was not in keeping wtlh the 
philosophies thai inseminated the Land 
of the Free. But romantic love was 
bom of Romanticism, and that philoso- 
phy is decidedly French in origin. 

Around the lime our nation was 
bom, the French were in the midst of 
Iheir own political upheaval. The liber- 
tarian ideals lhai fomented Ihe French 
Revolution fathered Romanticism. 
Romanticism itself was a revolt against 
Rationalism— a triumph of emotion 
over reason and intellect. 

So you see, that most American of 
traditions, marriage based on romantic 
love, is wholly Un-American. For love 
of our country, we would ban foolish 
frippery that celebrates i 



you hold tight to the belief thai when 
things get really, really bod. Ricardo

of a romantic notion it thaif" your pro- 
fessor might ask if be or she is particu- 
larly benevolent and so conceals the 
true question. "Just how dumb are 
you?" 

Aside from the evidence that 
ic love is unpatriotic and unreal - 
. there arc practical reasons that 
is shaky foundation for a mar- 
riage, as indicated by tbc testimonies of 
Uiose mamed couples interviewed. 

"Romance is based on mystery," 
said Lisa, a 28-year-old nurse who has 
been married to her second husband for 
two years. Romance. Lisa said, neces- 
sarily dies shortly after Ihe honey- 
moon. "It's one thing lo embroider on 
the James Bond qualities of your 
boyfriend — the way he holds the chair 
when you sit down and all that bull- 
shit — when he's distant, when he

going to change the reality — be belch-

do with that? Romance pretty much 
dies as soon as be gels comfortable

Joe also laughs at romance When 
Rita Marie was dating me she ate like a 
bird. I don't know — she wanted me to 
think she was frail or some crap like 
that- She eats like nobody's business! 
That gal is a pig — finishes her dinner 
then slicks her fork in mine. 

I'm not saying that I care if she's a 
pig or not. I'm saying thai all the crap 
you do and say when you're dating is 
exactly that — crap. If I held her up lo 
the image she tried to create, she'd fail. 
II I held her up lo tbc image of her that

Webster's dictionary includes tbc 
following in its definition of romance: 
"extravagant invention or wild exag-

description of fiction— or the definition

love has no factual basis. Romantic

Dear Aunt Louise, 

I rend your column every week and 
I find it so humorous because you're so 
real with the people and their problems. 
That's wbat 1 like so much about you. 
Do you think that is a problem with 
most people in this world, the inability 
to be real with others? 
Sincerely. 

Looking For Real People 
Dear Looking For Real People, 

Honey, listen to your Aunt Louise! 
My mama always taught me to be 
myself no matter what. And I'll tell you 
this much, I have never bad so many 
friends in my entire life as I have now. 
You sec the older you get, the cosier it 
is for one to be truthful because you 
don't care. So, cupcake, if I were you I 
wouldn't wait until you reach my age, 
you need to tell it like it is now!

A Dose of Douse 

What's wrong with 'white folk' 



'. Utile brother. Nigger 
Intellectual Hillbilly/ White folk. 
Fag Whore Labels Shocked! 
For the past couple weeks, people 

Somlhing I find great humor in, simply 
because of the fact that I cannot be a 
racist because I do not control the four 
elements of socialization in the world: 
education, economics, the media, and 
soicol/culrurc. 

Now, from the perspective of Ibis 
campus they could say, ah, yes you do. 
But only to an extent I can monitor 
what I want to write about, but under 
the supervision of the editor in chief 

Now, I can have race hale and big- 
otry which is similar to being a racist I 
know some people automatically 
would probably say Ih3t I hate white 
folks. I don't hate white folks, I lake 
great offense to that Why some of my 




best friends arc white 

I think for me lo hale white folks 
would be [or me to do the lame thing 
that moil racist folks do, judge some- 
one on the basis of (km color. I 
couldn't do that. As a matter of fact. I 
don't Why the (wo people who have 
supposed me for the last year or so 
while working on (his paper happen (o 
be white. Now. we don'l always agree 
on certain issues thai I cover, but they 
still support me. And 1 don't hate them 
because of differing viewpoints 

I was talking with mom over the 
weekend about my articles and such. 
She pointed out to me (hat I always 
uselhc term white folks in a negative 
context all of (he lime therefore assing- 
ing a racist connotation to it. 

It's (rue. It docs sound like 1 am 
being biased against people with 
European backgrounds 



Some people always point ou( skin 
color to define (he person, and I am 
jus( doing (he same thing 1 hive iel&lt; 
dom labeled white folks as racist. 
Actions and people jr.- iwi dliTcnni

call someone a racis( because of who 
the pert on is and another (o call some- 
one a racist because of the person's

are more interested in attacking (he

So. (he nex( (ime white folks read a

Notes from Wost... 



Feminists 
are people? 



Before you amwcr, contiJer the fol- 
lowing dialogue, which ii not made up: 
He I don't like feminiiu. 
She Bu! you like me. ind 
I'm » femiflLil 

He: No, you're noL 

I've hud thii conversation or wm« 
wiition on It many limei, and il never 
ceaici lo amaze me Whal, I wonder. 
doei he expecl a feminiit lo doT Rip 
off her bra and «el fire lo il? Demand 
equal acccn lo ibe men's room? 
Confiscate hii "Playboy" collection? 

Feminism it a basic pan of my iden- 
lily, maybe even more than my gray 
hair. I don'l conceal either my feml- 
niim or my hair— but no one contra- 
dict* me if I jay "My hair is gray." No 
doubt that's due to widespread agree- 
ment on the meanings of the wordt 
"gray" and "hail'." However, this man 
and J appear to have rather different 
ideas as lo (he meaning of "feminist" 
— his probably based largely on media 
images and cliches, and mine based on 
feminist friends, colleagues, and 
acquaintances — people. 

The feminists I know arc (mostly) 



women and (tome) men who believe 
ih ii women are people— that women 
deserve the lame rights, privileges and 

actively seek change lo remed) 
inequities Ibal exist, including 
inequities among women of dif- 
ferent races, classes and cultures 
Most of us are normal, law-abid- 
ing citizens wilb jobs, families 
pels, and mortgages. Why then i: 
(be stereotyped image of at 
angry, strident man-hating she- 
monster more real than we are tc 
(he man who tells me I'm no( s 
feminist? I can't do justice to tba 
question in ibis small space, bu 
here ore a couple of thoughts. 

First, no one likes to lose privi- 
leges And lei's face it if women 
really did have all the same rights, 
opportunities, etc., as men, then 
the advantages that men enjoy 
because of their gender would cease to 
exist. Thus, whal feminists advocate 
and strive for con be profoundly threat- 
ening—as threatening and as revolu- 
tionary as the loss of "while privilege" 
that must take place if racism is ever to 
be eliminated. 



Second, while feminists arc not angry 
and strident all of toe lime, most of us 
jjc (jusufiibly i angry and strident pan

: bailie are angriesl when 
I begun to realize how 
; the problems arc, some gel 
angrier as we get older — and whenever 
we get angry, the stereotype is rein- 
forced. (Can't be helped, though — 



you've probably noticed, too that say- 
ing please and waiting your rum isn't 
the lactic of successful revolutions!) 
Finally, noisy and largely symbolic 
events such as demonstrations, take- 
back- Ibe- nigbt marches, and speak -outs 
are real too. and more "newsworthy" 
than the day-to-day work feminists do 



ving ager 



..-.Is 



factories, homes, businesses, hospitals. 
libraries, and all the other places we 
work. The images from media events 
persist, even when they never hap- 
pened — ibe infamous bra-burning of 
the 1960s being a case in point. 

Yes, it's true — Ibe bra burners arc a 
lie. They were made up by a journalist 
assigned lo write a humorous piece 
about a demonstration at the 1968 Miss 
America Pageant. If you're interested, 
you can read the details in the 
September 1992 issue of "Ms." 
Doubtless, though, those fictional fire- 
brands will continue to complete with 
real feminists— who are people — for a 
long time yet to come.

dealing with alcohol in light of the 
recent death of a Fort Wayne citizen 
because of the alcohol connection. 




"It's a timely topic that needs lo 
be addressed especially within the 
Fort Wayne industry itwir," Knight 
said "It will be advantageous for

Although the tennis team fell to 
Southern Indiana, it recorded three vic- 
tories at the memorial. 

After Brogan felt that a victory over 
Wabash was guaranteed, he made the 
decision to vary the line up. 

"Once we had the game," said 
Brogan. "we experimented with some 
different line ups and gave some other 
people a little rest." 

This variation of players recorded a 
5-4 victory over Wabash. 

Given this lime for the other play-
