TWltter is a concept sim-' 
plified, novel, and though* 
probably pure genius, 
proves disagreeable to most 
IMidwesterners polled. 



Recently recognized byi 
major publications across 
the country. Twitter com- 
bines the environment of 
social networking, the in-l 
stant communication of 
text messaging, and the rel-; 
evant readership and com-i

From Page 1 



In comparison to Myspace and Facebook, 
Twitter can be described as younger, nerdy, 
and possibly less obnoxious. Inc. magazine 
describes Twitter as Blogger and social net- 
working "stripped to its core." 



The core is a 140 - character text comment. 



Meaning? 



There is less to do on Twitter unless you're 
an avid reader who treats text messaging hke 
leather - bound volumes of information. 



With the ability to foUow other 'tweets' or 
micro - blogs, Twitter allows cell phone carri- 
ers to be updated with information their on- 
line profile subscribes to. 



One is apt to spend less time in an environ 
ment such as Twitter because information is 
in the user's control. 



Does this mean you won't get addicted like 
other social networking sites? 



Twitter lacks overindulgent applications 
and offers minimal profile maintenance

It is often said that a

based on a "three-legged 
stool" of Social Security,

Louisidiid's illegal drug tax law is constitutional 



By Daily Reveille 



In January, a batch 
of marijuana-laced 
Rice Krispie Treats 
cost a Termessee man, 
William Hoak, 511,506 
because his items were 
not decorated with a 
Tennessee illegal drug 
tax stamp. 

Illegal drug tax 
laws are challenged 



on constitutionality 
because many people 
do not understand how 
an illegal substance can 
be taxed. 

Most states have 
adopted the illegal 
drug lax, Arizona being 
the first in 1983. New 
York Gov. Eliot Spilzer 
oudined his plan diis 
past month to adopt 
the illegal drug tax, 
according to The New 
York Times. This will 



make NewYork the 30th drug tax stamp at the 
state to acquire the tax. DepartmentofRevenue, 

"The legistlative intent... 

is to impose an additional 

penalty - tax evasion - upon 

drug offenders." 



Louisiana law ' 

requires illegal drug according to the 
sellers to purchase a National Organization 



for the Reform of 
Marijuana Laws. A seller 
anonymously pays the 
required tax depending 
on the contraband's 
gram size. The drug 
seller then receives a 
stamp to place on each 
gram of marijuana. 

Louisiana's 
Marijuana and 

Controlled Dangerous 
Substance Tax Law, 
RS 47:2601, states an 
individual is required 



to pay S3.50 per gram 
of marijuana and S200 
per gram of dangerous 
substances, such as 
cocaine. 

"The legislative 

intent of drug tax laws is 
to impose an additional 
penalty - tax evasion 
- upon drug offenders 
after they are arrested 
and cfiminally charged 
with a drug violation," 
according to the 
NORML Web site. 



Give longshot Ralph Nader a fair chance 



By The Daily Nebrsskan 



The name alone 
can, among the right 
company, inspire 

instant polarization 
and controversy. Sadly, 
it has in a way become a 
dirtyword to the people 
the man wants to help 
most. 

The last seven years 
have been tough for 
those people, who in 
2000 looked to start a 
new millennium v/ith 
a clean slate. People 



looked to vote for a 
candidate they didn't 
have any reservations 
about in a time when 
the political system was 
beginning to show a real 
ugly side. 

Ralph Nader was 
that man. 

He'd made a career 
out of fighting for 
the consumer, for 
the environment, 

for democracy. He 
was someone who 
embodied the kind of 
anti-establishment 
views that could make 
real change in a country 



where two parties were 
starting to look like one. 

In the end he made 
just enough change to 
take away what could 
have been a deciding 
number of votes firom 
Al Gore and help make 
Florida a losing batde. 

Today, of course, 
there's no doubt in 
anyone's mind that 
Al Gore would have 
been a different kind of 
president than George 
W, Bush. 

This was obvious 
four years ago when 
Nader announced he 



would run again, to the 
sound of Democrats 
slapping their heads 
around the country. 
John Kerry didn't need 
Nader's help to lose 
miserably, but entering 
the race didn't do much 
to clear the consumer 
advocate crusader's 
name. 

The nation was 
subjected to another 
fun-filled Bush term, 
and now here we sit, 
gearing up for what we 
hope will be another 
tabula rasa election, an 
election people on tiie 



Democratic side should 
have a hard time feeling 
cynical about. 

So can I be blamed 
forgettinga familiarbad 
taste irt my mouth when 
1 found out Naderwould 
be running again? 

Can I be blamed 
for asking a simple 
question: Do we need 
Ralph Nader? 

A huge part of me 
wants to say "no." That 
part of me wants to say 
that at Uiis point, in an 
election which is all 
about change (or at least 
talking about change]. 



in which a woman and 
a black man are strong 
candidates for the first 
time in history, the 
last thing we need is 
a spoiler or an extra 
contender. 

Whether or not 
Nader knocked the 
presidency out of Gore's 
hands, this country 
might not really need an 
extra voice to add to the 
schizophrenic volume 
of campaign season. 

Then again,' wcmight 
need that voice and not 
even know it.

an amazing gift. Due to a 
genetic anomaly, he has 
the ability to teleport, or 
jump, to anywhere in the

t actor playing both roles. Sarah Bolger and 
Mary-Louise Parker, playing the twin's old- 
er sister and mother respectively, also shine 
quite well in their roles. The special effects 
create the many fantastical creatures, who are 



realistically portrayed in 
the film. These creatures, 

though extraordinary, 
blend well into the for- 
ested environment around 
the Spidenvick estate and 
aren't annoy ingly showy. 
The voice-acting, done by 
the likes of Seth Rogen 
and Martin Short, make these creatures into actual 
characters and thus make the unbelievable, believable. 

While "The Spider\vick Chronicles" may not 
excite every movie-goer with it's family friendly at-

and appeal lo as many 
countries as possible. A 
lot of the work was done 
through Informal cau- 
cusing and negotiation. 

"They gol very little 
sleep, bul all ihe students 
were excited about it," 
Toole said. "They had no 
experience in the Model 
UN but they're really 
good snidents and they 
proved lo be good nego- 



tiating." 

There were no spe- 
cific prerequisites for the 
team members, though 
members were chosen 
competitively. Team 
members with high GPAs 
and who had taken rel- 
evant classes, particu- 
larly in upper level in- 
ternational politics and 
economics courses, were 
given preference. 

By participating in 
the Model UN, students 
can gain practical politi- 
cal skills and realize how 
difficult it is to get coun- 
tries to work together, 
as there is no political 
forum anywhere ivith a 
wider diversity' of cultural 
political and economical 
interests. 

"I personally went to 
the conference for the ad- 
, 10 tigureoul 



if I might be interested in 
a UN career, and for the 
opportunity to talk about 
terrorism, land mines, 
and other global issues," 
participant Amanda Mc- 
Cann said, "If you're in- 
terested in world events, 
you should do this. It's 
a great opportunity to 
view what's going on in 
the world from a differ- 
ent perspective." 

The details for future 
IPFW Model UN teams 
and simulations have not 
been established, though 
it is projected that the 
next conference will take 
place in the spring or fall 
OF2009. 

"It's very exciting to 
be around 800 to 1000 
people who are as knowl- 
edgeable and interested 
in politics as you are." 
Toole said. 



Achievement Celebration, 
nominations begin this week 



By LOUISA DANIELSON 

DanlbOieipfw.edu 



There is nothing like 
a bit of positive recog- 
nition to keep a person 
mouvated. 

Such recognition is 
perhaps more mean- 
ingful when it comes 
from students, as they 
can have a major impact 
in giving some of that 
recognition during the 
nomination process for 
the Student Achievement 
Celebration, beginning 
this week. 

Nominations can be 
submitted in eight differ- 
ent categories, as illus- 
trated below. 

Nominations consist 
of a written essay that is 
double spaced and no 
longer tlian two pages. 
The essay should dem- 
onstrate how the nomi- 
nee exhibited superb 
leadership, excellent 



scholastic assistance, 
entrepreneurship or any 
other qualities that made 
them stand out during 
the 2007-2008 school 
year. 

Specific insiruciions 
for each award, as well as 
the criteria for eligibility 
to be a recipient or make 
a nomination, are listed 
on the Student Achieve- 
ment Celebration Award 
Nomination Form that is 
being posted this week. 

Although the major- 
ity of awards are student- 
oriented, faculty and staff 
are welcome to submit 
entries for students. 

For example, there is 
the Student Organiza- 
tion Member of the Year 
Award, and students 
are also encouraged to 
recommend faculty for 
other awards such as the 
Students' Choice Award 
for Teaching Excellence. 
"You can nominate for 
more than one award," 
Interim Director of Stu- 
dent Life Audrey Moore 



said, who is helping co- 
ordinate the event. 

"We encourage as 
many students and staff 
to make nominations." 

Entries should con- 
sist of one or two typed 
pages and the lilled- 
out Student Achieve-

"Youth cares deeply, 
acts ineffectively." 



By Kristin Butler 

U-WIRE 



! often wonder if people 
wlio call my generation 
"quiet" and "apathetic" 
actually know many 13 
lo 28-year-olds. Because 
those who do can attest 
that "kids today" are just 
as motivated and as ide- 
alistic as their parents 
and grandparents once 

From chmate change to 
the glohal war on terror 
to the plight of Sub-Sa- 
haran Africa, people my 
age care deeply about the 
world around us. We are 
working hard lo ensure 
change, and we're not 
afraid to get our hands 
dirty in the process. 

The problem is that 
we have never been less 
effective. It's simply not 
enough for us to be a 
member of Facebook's 



"One Million Strong for 

Obama" group when we 
live in nadon whose po- 
lidcal economy runs on 
campaign contributions 
— not Facebook friends. 

And bet\veen our woe- 
ful underrepresentation 
on Election Day {only 36 
percent of voters aged 18 
lo 24 cast ballots in the 
highly contentious 2000 
presidential elections) 
and our ividespread re- 
jection of the political ac- 
tivism that amplified our 
parents' voices 40 years 
ago, young people have 
never cared so much 
about issues they affect 
so little. 

That's a real tragedy in 
light of the profound ef-' 
feci young voters could 
be having on the political 
status quo: A Jan. 30 sur- 
vey of political leanings 
among young people 
under 30 found that 75.6 
percent of Gen Y-ers op- 
pose the war in Iraq, with 
68.6 percent calling for an 
immediate withdrawal of 
troops. About 55 percent 



of respondents opposed 
a constitutional amend- 
ment banning same-sex 
marriage, and 55.2 per- 
cent supported legalized 
abortion. 

An overwhelming 80,5 
percent also supported 
legislation to reduce 
greenhouse gas emis- 
sions, and 89.5 percent 
further supported the 
development of alterna- 
tive fuels lo reduce de- 
pendence on foreign oil. 

But the real question 
is whether our generation 
can translate this year's 
passion into long-term, 
meaningful political 
change. We may not have 
a- charismatic presiden- 
tial candidate lo unite 
behind every year, and 
we still lack the political 
legitimacy that wealthier 
and better-connected 
groups like seniors use to 
their advantage. 

Still, if [his year's out- 
pouring has taught us 
that Generation Y has ac- 
tually been more clueless 
than quiet. 



"Keystrokes carry 
across the nation," 



By Nicholas J. Pappas 

UWIRE 



I have never met Barack 
Obama. I have never 
shaken Barack Obama's 
hand — but I can say 
he is my friend. With 
the growth of sites like 
MySpace and Facebook, 
politicians today have a 
resource they've never 
had in history. They have 
an online bullhorn. 

I can't say that these 
sites are good for Ameri- 
ca. Some like to call us a 
quiet and apathetic gen- 
eration, but the opera- 
tive word is "lazj'," We've 
grown up playing video 
games. Tumbleweeds roll 
down windy suburban 
streets. Still, many un- 
derestimate our ability to 
communicate. 

We may not be getting 
out and holding signs. 



but we aren't quiet. We 
may not be boisterous, 
but our soft keystrokes 
carry across nations. We 
may not meet people for 
coffee or sit in circles dis- 
cussing the latest politics, 
but our online groups are 
in the thousands. 
There is power in words. 
Those spoken float off 
into oblivion. Those 
posted, and reposted, 
and reposted. in bulletins 
will live forever. 

On Super Tuesday, my 
bultedns were filled \vith 
reminders to get out and 



vote. My online friends 
updated their "status" 
with "I voted for the first 
time," "Obama for Ptes! 
(sorry Hillary)," and "one 
small step for a man. one 
giant leap out of office 
for George W." 

Previous generadons 
voted anonymously and 
without thanks. This gen- 
eration has an outlet lo 
tell everyone they know 
that, today, they made a 
difference — and being 
able to hnally share that 
pride makes all the dif- 
the world.

Fife and company 
fall on Senior Day 

■ Loss to lUPUl closes out week that included victory 
over Western Illinois, personal best performances 

Although IPFW had five Mastodons in double figures, they couldn't contain 
the lUPUl duo ofGeorge Hill and Gary Patterson. Thepair torched IPFW for 30 
and 27, respectively, as the lags downed the "Dons in overtime. IPFW suffered 
their second losstolUPUl this season, 88-81. 

IPFW started out shaky offensively, turning the ball over four times in the first 
three minutes of play. lUPUI reaped tbe benefits oflPFW's early errors, going up 
2-11 with 16:18 remaining in the first. 

Senior DeWitt Scott began to chip away at the lUPUl lead, draining his first of 
four tbree-pointers at the 15:55 mark. Scott converted another three-point play 
just minutes later, sinking three free throws after being fouled by Hill beyond the 
arch, bringinglhe'Dons within three, 16-13. 

With seven minutes to play In the half, Chris Perkins was hacked driving hard 
to the basket, but was able to make the play. He sunk the free throw to earn the 
three-point play and give the " Dons their first lead of the afternoon, 25-22. 

Although the " Dons continued to battle, a string of six missed shots late in the 
first half allowed lUPUl to go into the break up by 7, 40-33. 

The ■ Dons were forced to play catch up in the second half, dovm by as many 

as 10 points at one point. With twelve minutes to play IPFW found their 
rhythm, fueled by a lineup of junior David (I^son and four seniors: Demetrius 
Johnson, Jaraun Burrows, Perkins, and Scott. It was only fitting that on Senior 
Night' it was this group of athletes that was able to battle back, tying the game, 
71-71 at the end of regulation. 

IPFW and lUPUE traded baskets in a thrilling overtime, with three lead changes 
and five ties. With 52 seconds remaining in overtime, Patterson buried a three 
to put lUPUI up, 84-81 and the " Dons were unable to recover. Three subsequent 
turnovers by IPFW sealed the win for lUPUI, 88-81. 

lUPUI was led by Hill who recorded a double-double with 30 points and 11 
rebounds; he also added 4 assists. Patterson scored 27, while Austin Montgomery 
tallied 17. 

IPFW bad five Mastodons in double figures. They were led by (Larson who was 
8-13 from the floor, connecting for 23 points and grabbing 6 rebounds. The 23 
poinlsout ofCarson wasa new career high, elminating the 22 point high that he 
had set days earlier in a ivin over Western Illinois. 

Scott sank 4 triples, elevating his career total to 203 threes. He finished \vith 
19 points and6rebounds. Johnson had 12 points, while contributing a team-high 
7 assists to the IPFW effort. 

Fellow seniors Burrows and Perkins rounded out those scoring in double 
figures with 13 and 10 respectively Burrows pulled down 6 boards as well. 

Carson scored a then career-high 22 points and Perkins tossed in a season- 
high 20 as IPFW had no trouble in beating Western Illinois, 85-62 on Thursday 
night at the Memorial Coliseum. 

FreshmanforwardNickLuttrell, who saw plenty of action with the Burrows in 
foul trouble, gave [PFW a 67-4 1 lead wilh a pair of buckets in the paint. 

IPFW shot 57.1% from the floor, their second highest average of the season 
(57.8% vs. Manchester- 11/21). They held Western Illinois to just 33.3% from the ' 
floor. 

IPFW plays their final two regular season games on the road at UMKC and 
Southern Utah before the Summit League Tournament begins. IPFW is currently 
fourth in the league. 

Martinez Breaks School Record 
at Boilermaker Invitational 



The women's TYack and Field 
team competed in the Boilermaker 
Invitational hosted by Purdue 
University yesterday afternoon. The 
non-team scoring meet precludes the 
Mastodons' first appearance in The 
Summit Leaguelndoor Championships 
which will take place in Sterling. IL on 
Friday, February 29, 

Highlighting the meet were 
multiple season bests, as well as a 
record breaking performance by IPFW 
junior Crystina Martinez. 

Martinez placed second in the 
3,000m, falling only to former All- 
American out of Illinois, Cassie Hunt. 
Her time of 9:59.23 is nearly IB seconds 
better than any of Martinez's times 
in the event this season, and also 
shatters the school record of 10:08.53 
iliai she previously set in 2006. Sister, 



and constant competitor of Crystina, 
Crystal Martinez finished third in the 
event with at time of 10:03,38. 

Also securing season bests were 
lessica Palevich in the 800m run with 
a time of 2:27.07; Nakita Matthews 
who ran an 8.23 60m dash; and Brooke 
Newman with a pole vault of 3.22m, .02 
meters higher than her previous best 
set earlier this season. , 

Coach Mike Fruchey is 
enthusiastic about next week's league 
championships and the performance 
of the Martinez twins stating, "The 
twins ran fantastic races. I feel they 
are peaking at the perfect time for the 
Summit League Championships next 
week. I think that the entire team is 
really excited about conference and 
looking forward to the challenge it 
presents,"
