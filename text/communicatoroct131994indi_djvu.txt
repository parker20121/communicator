IPSGA approves new parking garage 



by Nol T. Beckley 
StalTWrller 

On Monday, IPFW studenl 
government approved a second 
parking garage wilh an amend- 
ment thai ii would be built south 
of the library. 

Chris Douse, Chairman of 
Legislative Affairs for IPSGA, 
said, "I would love for the admin- 
istration lo respect what we've 
decided lo do and go along wilh 
putting it on the south side of the 



library." 

Douse added that the adminis- 
tration wiJI probably see the reso- 
lution passed and ignore the 
amendment. 

IPSGA Vice President of 
Legislation Amy Steenman said 
that all the administration wanted 
was the student government's 
opinion on the construction of a 
new parking garage. 

Vice Chancellor of Financial 
Affairs Walt Branson said that the 
new parking garage would solve 



current parking problems. The 
garage also would solve future 
problems that may arise if the new 
science building is approved. 

Branson said, "Our optimism 
about the science building makes 
the parking situation more 
urgent." 

The administration proposes to 
build a garage on the road next lo 
the tennis courts. The garage will 
replace the 171 spaces that will be 
lost when and if construction 
begins on the new science build- 



ing, according to Branson. 

The alternative to a parking 
garage, Branson said, is flat park- 
ing lots built on the north side of 
Gates Spons Center. 

In five years, Branson expects 
the north side of the campus to 
expand dramatically. The addition 
of a parking garage will make 
parking more accessible for stu- 
dents who will have classes on the 
north side of campus. 

"We want to develop the north 
side of campus because the next 



Congressional candidates face-off 

Long, Souder debate at IPFW 



by Jamie Craver 
Staff Writer 

On Sunday. October 2, IPFW's 
Neff Auditorium was the site of a 
congressional debate between 
Republican candidate Mark Souder 
and Democratic candidate Jill Long. 
The event was sponsored by IPFW 
and the American Association of 
Retired People. 

The first question posed to the 
two candidates was a request that 
they state their views on the recent 
crisis in Haiti. 

Souder stated bis point of view 
by saying, "I feel that it is essential 
that our national interests be at stake 
when we go into a military invasion. 
We cannot use our military like the 
Arkansas Slate Police; ii is an 
appalling use of our American mili- 
tary." Souder aiso commented thai 
on June 9 there was a vote in 
Congress to decide on an invasion 
of Haiti, and Jill Long voted against 
this. 

Long, who staled that she is not a 
supporter of the invasion of Haiti, 
responded by saying that she initial- 
ly opposed U. S. troops being sent 
to Haiti, but gave her absolute sup- 
port to them once the decision had 
already been made. 

Both candidates said they would 
not vote for tax increases. 

Long addressed the tax issue 
issue first: "1 believe the problem 
with the national debt is that we 
spend too much on the federal gov- 
ernment, not that citizens do not pay 
enough in taxes." Long also said 
that they have already reduced the 
size of the federal government by 
cutting seventy thousand unneces- 
sary positions, a move that she feels 
is a key to downsizing the national 
debt. 

Souder rebutted Long's state- 
ment with the assertion that by her 
support of the health care reform 
bill, the size of the federal govern- 
ment will increase. 

When the subject of abortion 
arose, Long staled, "1 believe that 
the decision to have an abortion 
ought to remain a personal decision; 
however, I do believe that there 
ought to be restrictions on funding 
for abortions." She also said that she 
recently supported an amendment 
that restricts funding for abortions 
except for life-threatening instances, 
or when a woman who seeks abor- 
tion is a victim of rape or incest. 

Souder replied, "I believe that 
life begins at conception. If you 
believed like I do, that the tiny baby 
is human, then you, too, would take 
all stands possible to protect it." 

The candidates also differed in 
their views on term limits for con- 
gressional representatives. Souder 
expressed his support for limits by 
saying that too much power is given 
to committees in Congress who 
have established strong media and 
iiii.ina.il contacts over long periods 



of time, which can lead to greed. 

Long disagreed, saying that the 
people of a district should be given 
the freedom to decide on whoever 
they want to represent them and for 
however long they wani that person 
to do so. 

Health care was also brought up, 
and Souder remarked, "1 believe in 
free market competition, and I 
believe that the government's role is 
at the edges, as we do wilh 
Medicare and as we do wilh 
Medicaid, lo help guide this thing 
but not to take it over. Therefore, 
the people can make the decisions 
and sort it out, as opposed to the 
bureaucrats in Washington making 
the decisions." 

Long responded by saying , 
"Competition in the health care field 
unlike any other field actually drives 
the cosl of il up." Long continued 
to say that she has been working on 
a bipartisan bill that would keep 
health care in the private sector so 
that citizens could still pick their 
own doctor, health care plan, and 
health insurance plan but still keep 
the federal government involved. 

When asked about what the 
Federal government's role in educa- 
tion should be Souder replied, " I 
believe ihe role of the government is 
nol to make decisions for me and 
my family. I believe in anything 
that empowers parents, I believe in 
magnet schools, I believe in public 
school choice, private school choice 
and home schooling." 

Long agreed, adding, "1 am a 
strong advocate of funding for edu- 
cation, keeping curriculum and 
social decisions at the local and 
state level, rather than ai the federal 
level. I am also a strong advocate 
for allowing parents to choose 
schooling for their children." 

Long also slated that she opposed 
taxes to pay for parochial schools. 
and that there needs to be a "separa- 
tion of church and state." 

Long said that she supported the 
crime bill, which she referred to as 
"mainly good." She said Ihe benefit 
of the crime bill is Ihe fact that it 
does not receive its funding from 
taxation, but from the cutting of 
unnecessary jobs in the federal gov- 
ernment. Long continued to explain 
that the plan would build more jails, 
stronger police forces and create an 
expansion of the death penalty. 

Souder disagreed with the rea- 
soning behind ihe crime bill, and 
said thai we need to rebuild higher 
moral standards and self-worth in 
America, not stronger police forces 
and larger jails. "I do not believe 
that crime is the primary goal of the 
federal government except when it 
crosses state lines." said Souder. 
Souder criticized Long for earlier 
staling that trie culling of unneces- 
sary jobs in the federal government 
would help cut the deficit, but then 
also saying that the money would be 
used for such endeavors as the

crime bill. "There is no money, 

folks," stated Souder. 

Souder also said that he did not 
favor a worker's right lo strike with- 
out fear of being permanently 
replaced. Souder said that this 
would lead to "push-button strikes" 
and trial this could disrupt what is a 
fairly steady balance between man- 
agement and labor. 

Long rikagiwri saying, 'UnfaturflEly, 
if you can fire someone going on 
strike, then that balance is in favor 
of management. I think it is very 
important that you can not be fired 
for going on strike, and that Is why I 
am nol a supporter of the striker- 
replacement bill." 

The election will lake place on 
November 8. 



two or three buildings will go 
there," Branson said. 

Student government doesn't 
believe the proposed site for 
building the parking garage by the 
tennis courts would benefit the 
majority of sludents. Several sena- 
tors feel the admirustralion wants 
the garage buili near Gates Sports 
Center to handle parking overflow 
from sporting events. 

Branson agreed that the pro- 
posed garage would make parking 
easier during sporting events. 



If the new science building is 
not approved, Branson said 
"IPFW still has too few parking 
spaces." 

The parking fees will go up 
"substantially" if a new parking 
garage is built, according lo 
Branson. 

IPSGA had been debating the 
parking garage issue for two 
months. Steenman said, "The res- 
olution was supposed to pass at 
ihe end of Sepiember, but we 
didn't have a quorum." 



U.S. Senator 

speaks at 
convocation 



By Krlstle Rlcci Schlundt 
Editor In Chief 

Richard Lugar, one of 
Indiana's U.S. Senators, was the 
keynote speaker at the Honors 
Convocation last week. 

Lugar emphasized the impor- 
tance Of obtaining a college 
degree in terms of "earning 
power," He referred to 
"Workforce 2000," the Hudson 
Institute report commissioned by 
the federal government three 
years ago, which states (among 
many other points) that in the 
year 2000, a minimum of 14 years 
of education will be required of 
anyone who wishes to maintain 



steady employment. 

"We hope.. .your sense of learn- 
ing and achievement will be 
infectious. We hope you influence 
others. Education... is our human 
capilol of Ihe world..." Lugar 
said. 

"IPFW is critical to our state 
because it has brought so many 
people into higher education. The 
year 2000 will come, and, ..we 
will be ready for Workforce 2000 
because we have students such as 
you and a university such as 
this..." Lugar concluded. 

Richard Lugar was a high 
school valedictorian. He attended 
Dennison University, and later 
became a Rhodes scholar. 



IPFW hosts student 
leadership conference 



by Melissa Young 

SUIT Writer, and 

Krlstle Rkcl Schlundt, 

Editor In Chief 

Earlier this month, the Indiana 
University Foundation sponsored the 
ninth annual "Seeds of Leadership" 
conference. The event was hosted by 
IPFW, and all IU campuses were 
invited. 

Student leaders from all IU cam- 
puses were invited to attend, said 
IPSGA Vice President of 
Legislation and conference organiz- 
er Amy Steenman, all but the 
Bloomington campus were repre- 
sented this year. 

Club officers, student newspaper 
participants, advisers, program 
board members and government 
leaders were also encouraged to 
attend. 

Student Senator Kevin Eads 
attended for the interaction with 
other student government leaders, 
and said, " We spent a lot of time 
talking between students about how 
each campus docs things." 



"The main focus," Steenman 

said, "was community building and 
team building." 

The event was essentially a prob- 
lem-solving session, Steenman 
added. "It is easier lo solve a prob- 
lem if you have someone to share a 
brain with," she said. 

Steenman and Greg C alien, stu- 
dent activities director, team- 
planned the two-day event, which 
included round table discussions. 
There were about ten topics, includ- 
ing diversity, fundraising, computer 
access issues and events advertising, 
said Steenman. 

"We had discussion groups with- 
out advisers, and that helped us talk 
more freely," Eads said. "We gol 
some great ideas from other student 
leaders." 

"We realized our similarities and 
differences," which helps leaders 
learn from each other and grow, said 
Steenman. 

Eads added, "We got more oul of 
each other than the scheduled 
discussion." 



Library staff asks IPSGA for funds 



by Lourdcs Tlglao 

SUff Writer, and 

Krlstle Rkd Scblundt 

Editor In Chief 

IPFW's Helmke Library has recent- 
ly received informal ion about another 
feature lo possibly add lo its collection 
of information indexes: First Search. 

Fust Search is a collection of data- 
bases directed toward (he science 
areas, said Judy Violeltc, associate 
librarian and assistant director of Ihe 
Helmke Library. 

Because the library's science data- 
bases are nol extensive. Violetle said. 



and because First Search can bo 
accessed off-campus, "it will be an 
enormous advantage," 

However, the library budget for the 
year was spent or allocated before 
acquiring Ihe information about First 
Search, so the library needs lo get 
ahold of about $8,000 to be able to add 
First Search to the library caialogs, 
Violetle explained.

Faculty Forum [Letters to the Editor 



By Leslie Motz 
Acting Chair of Fine Arts 

We hear much about diversity 
ibese days. The concepl appears in 
almost any politically correct con- 
versation or publication. The 
Oxford English Dictionary defines 
diversity as "the condition or quali- 
ty of being diverse, different or var- 
ied; difference, unlikeness." 

We can look at diversity and its 
definition from either a negative or 
a positive perspective. If we see it 
in negative terms, we may be 
frightened or turned off by ideas, 
values or priorities unlike our own. 

On the other hand, by thinking 
positively about difference, we 
come to realize that ideas, values 
and priorities unlike our own can 
be exciting, enlightening and can 
expand our own world of ideas, our 
own lives. 

I believe the arts demonstrate 
the value and importance of diver- 
sity, and of unlikeness. Moreover, 



by learning to appreciate an in all National Endowment for lb e Arts. ColiSeillTl 611^11106 fieCClS tO DC rCODeiled 

forms, we better learn to appreciate emphaM/t.-d the ability of the arts to IT 



forms, we belter learn to appreciati 
diversity and difference in the peo- 
ple around us on campus, in our 
own community and around toe 
world. 

Diversity or unlikeness is a qual- 
ity artists, both visual and perform- 
ing, strive to achieve. Highly indi- 
vidualized expression is at the core 
of every piece of art and every 
stage performance. Each musician 
wants his or her interpretation of a 
Beethoven sonata to stand out from 
every other musiciiin's performance 
of the same sonata. A painter does 
not merely copy or trace the paint- 
ings of others but, rather, he inter- 
prets the material uniquely by 
arranging color and form in his 
own 'different' expression. While 
twenty people in a drawing class 
may be rendering the same siilllife 
arrangement, each produces a 
unique perspective from a slightly 
different angle and with a highly 
individualized technique. 

Jane Alexander, chair of the 



emphasized the ability of the arts to 
enrich our lives when she spoke 
last week in Fort Wayne. The arts 
help us to understand one another 
and can be a useful resource in 
resolving problems, she went on. 

Just as beautiful fractal pattern 
can be broken down into infinite 
repetitions of form, it is beauty of 
the whole, the beauty of all those 
individual forms coming together 
in lovely swirls of color, that 
delights the eye. 

In the same way. by understand- 
ing and appreciating our unique- 
ness as individuals, "our different- 
ness." we will make visible a strong 
pattern of cooperation and sense of 
community which will strengthen 
us all for challenges that lie ahead. 
Using the universal language of art, 
music and performance, we can 
join difference of culture, race, gen- 
der and class into a multi-media 
masterpiece. 



To the editor, 

I am a student at IPFW and 
come to school every day down 
Coliseum. Until this year you could 
turn left off Coliseum into the cam- 
pus. They blocked it off because it 
created too much traffic down 
Coliseum during the rush hour. 
This creates a big hassle for stu- 
dents who have to go to class. 
Besides who cares if traffic is a lit- 



tle heavier during the rush hour? I

The Communicator 
Mission Statement 

It is our mission to find and communicate the truth, 

as objectively as we can, about all that concerns IPFW, 

whether trivial or important. 

It is our mission to provide information where there is little, 

to address all facets of an issue, to reflect opinion, 

whether popular or unpopular, and to show alternative 

viewpoints. It is our mission to reach a diverse audience: 

students, staff, faculty, administration, alumni, and 

community — racial, social, and economic majority and minority. It is our 

mission to uphold the Constitutional rights of our 

audience and adhere to the code of ethics 

established by the Society of Professional Journalists. 

Finally, it is our mission grow and learn 

as individual writers and editors, 

students and citizens. 



To the editor, 

As a friend and I sat outside Ncff 
Mall wailing for our next class one 
day, I was stung by a bee on the 
bottom of my fool. It immediately 
began swelling up and was impossi- 
ble to walk on it. My friend helped 
me hobble inside Neff to the nurs- 
ing department. There, I was 
informed that mere is no clinic on 
campus, and there was not some- 
where I could go to get ice to bring 
down the swelling. However, I was 
instructed to go to the emergency 
room because the sting was quite 
bad. 

In all schools, elementary to high 



school, there is some type of clinic, 
although these schools rarely lake 
up more space than one square 
mile, and the enrollment of most is 
a quarter of that of IPFW. It is 
ridiculous that for any type of med- 
ical situation the only help available 
on a college campus is a registered 
nurse that can do no more than 
advise you to go to the emergency 
room. 

I often receive mail from IPFW 
telling me how much they help me. 
Most of the time it refers to the 
security on campus or what they do 
to protect me from drugs and alco- 
hol. The last thing I worry about is 
needing protection from alcohol or 



drugs on campus, although after-'my 
awareness was brought lip about'lhe 
lack of health care available, I do 
worry about needing some help 
while I am on campus because mere 
is absolutely none available. As stu- 
dents paying to attend IPFW we 
deserve the peace of mind that if 
something should happen to us on 
campus there is a place we can go 
for help. Wouldn't it be nice if ihe 
next letter sent out about our safety 
announced a clinic opening up on 
campus? 

Sincerely, 
AnneLindsley

To the editor, 

I am a sludeni at IPFW. Every 
morning I drive to college and have 
to allow myself an extra twenty to 
thirty minutes just for parking. It is 
like tonure finding a parking place 
on campus. It seems there are more 
students than parking places. It is so 
aggravating driving around for thir- 
ty minutes or more, just to find a 
parking place. When you finally 
find a place you are usually late for 
class. 

The university seems to gel big- 



ger each year. Since parking seems 
to be one of the major reasons stu- 
dents are late, then why not fix the 
problem? Everyone on the campus 
is on a specific lime limit to accom- 
plish his/her duties for the day. We 
do not need something like parking 
taking up so much time. We all 
know that time and punctuality arc 
important to the university. 

The university could help their 
parking problem by getting rid bom 
A and B parking zones. Everyone 
then can park were he/she would 
like. Somehow, the parking should 



idjusied to everyone's con- 
and allow more space and 
organization. 

It is my hope that someone will 
find the time to think about parking 
and correct the problem. Let's make 
the parking process simply filling 
your car into a space, and noi a con- 
stant struggle to find a spot. 

Would it not be nice if all stu- 
dents could minimize their time to 
find parking places and maximize 
their time for class?

True history continues 
to be distorted in society 



To the editor, 

It surprised me to find out that 
Egypt was in Africa; I went all die 
way through HIGH SCHOOL and 
nobody told me that. I weni to a 
black high school and my teachers 
obviously did not know that; ain't 
that a joke? I felt tike a goddamn 
fool; how could That happen? Do 
you realize what has lo take place 
before a deception of this magni- 
tude manifests? All the white schol- 



ars (Oxford-Harvard racist connec- 
tion) must give the support system 
for this to come off. 

Black people have not called 
these racists on all ihe lies they 
have told and especially ihe lies 
they have told us. How is ii we con- 
tinue to carry these white institu- 
tions with honor and all they have 
dealt in was lies? These Harvard- 
Oxford institutions were always 
based in racism, and one of iheir 
main concerns has been to foster 



white supremacy. You will notice 
our school books and ultra racism 
of their contents come from these 
scholars. It is not accident that our 
school books contained not infor- 
mation concerning the real history 
of black people. Certainly, ihe 
racists who wrote ihe books knew 
of our history; They have stolen all 
of our records, books, artifacts, 
treasures.eic.

Letters Continued Cam P u s Events Need Attention 



Why is il our scholars have nol 
called ihcsc racists out for a duel? Is 
it thai our scholars do not have con- 
fidence in their knowledge? Are 
they scared to call "boss" out and 
tell him to face that he has been 
lying like a dog down the flick? 

Our young people conlinue to 
believe thai the white racist scholars 
were telling (he truth about blacks 
being inferior because no black 
scholars have called them out in 
public! Why is thai? Our black 
scholars musi make this a PUBLIC 



FORUM that our people can wit- 
ness. This must be done in sight of 
the people; there is nol other way 
this cast can be broken. The brain- 
washing has been so complete, that 
only direct measures will gel the 
desired results. 

Black people must hear about 
the wonders of their ancestors with 
EVERYBODY PRESENT. Our 
young people must bear (in from of 
the Oxford-Harvard connection) 
thai it was their black ancestors 
who brought religion into the 



world, that it was black people who 
brought science, writing, architec- 
ture, agriculture, medicine, astrono- 
my, metallurgy, etc., into ihe world. 
Thai ALL ruins in the world, are 
the ruins of black people. Our 
scholars must go into the teeth of 
racism (the public forum) and make 
these facts manifest. It's lime we 
confront the lies that conlinue to 
cripple our people.

there are students who are con- 
cerned that Student Activities

branch of Indiana Purdue Sludeni

SAB works very hard to have 
events that appeal to more than just

StafT Writer 

I want to icll you a irue siory 
., ,aboui. a., friend of mine named 
, "Brad." Brad is a wonderful person 
who has a lot of love to give that 
special person. For over a year. 
Brad was in a very committed rela- 
tionship with "Craig." They did 
everything together, shared every- 
thing logeiher and even lived 
together. 

Brad always considered himself 
to be bisexual, rather than homosex- 
ual. I, at first, had a problem under- 
standing this concept. To be attract- 
ed to both sexes seemed rather inde- 
cisive. Personally, I could not date 
someone who is bisexual, for I have 
to deal with enough competition in 
ihe gay community. 

Brad would have me believe lhal 
bisexuals can actually carry on a 
monogamous relationship and that 
biscxualily means that one can fall 
in love with the right person, not the 
right person's sex. To him, Craig 
was not a man, but the person who 
captured his heart. 

Brad began to feci something 
missing in his relationship with 
Craig. Soon, the iwo broke up, leav- 
ing Craig with a heart shattered into 
a million pieces. Brad now envi- 
sioned a life as a heterosexual, with 
a house, 2.4 children, a dog and a 
cat. But his desire to be with men

Bisexual relationships often 
destroy parties involved 



still existed? So a perfect life for 
Brad would be to many a well-edu- 
cated woman with career goals, and 
fulfill his gay emotions with little 
liaisons with men, 

This, unfortunately, brings me 
back to square one. I feel that I am 
open-minded enough lo accept 
bisexuals, but not in this manner. If 
a relationship is to be successful, 
then cheating is a MUST-NOT. This 
goes for everybody, wilh no regards 
to any sexual orientation. 

Openly gay actor Harvey 
Fierstein once said that if bisexuals 
exist, then why is il that it is always 
the men who cheat on their girl- 
friends to have sex with men, and 
nol men cheating on their 
boyfriends to have sex with 
women? I now ask this of you. If 
you are bisexual, I ask that you 
write to The Communicator or leave 
them a numbeT by which I can con- 
tact you to discuss this. Discretion 
will be used if necessary. 

As for Brad, he is in his dream 
relationship and all plans are in 
progress. Craig took many months 
to recover from Brad; however, he 
will never be completely over him. 
He has begun a relationship that 
appears to be progressing to a com- 
mitment. I believe that both Brad 
and Craig learned a lot from each 
other; however, 1 am none-the- 
wiser.

IPFW Students involved on research program 



By Angle Smilh 
Features Writer 

When you go shopping, what 
makes you bui a pair of Reebok 
shoes over a pair of L.A. Gears, or 
Levi's jeans over Guess? 

Some people would say 
whichever is cheaper or whichever 
is made better, but the truth of the 
matter is it's all in the marketing. 

According to marketing major 
Shawn Neumann, "Marketing is a 
process of researching and planning 
detailed information of products for 
companies." 

Sieve Cochran gives his defini- 
tion as, "Marketing is deciding 
what people's needs are. and com- 
ing up with those needs." 

Well, whatever your definition 
is what it really boils down to is 
supply and demand. Companies 
want to know what it is that they 
can do belter lo increase sales and 
10 give the people what ihey want. 
They go about obtaining this infor- 
mation through research. 

Marketing research is a busi- 
ness/economics tool which is used 
by most organizations, profit or 
non-profit, in the country, in com- 
merce or free-u-ade, to enable them 
io design and make their products 
the way the consumer wants them. 
This in turn ups a companies rating 
and finacial base. 

Marketing research is a system 
whereby telephone and mail sur- 
veys are used to help organizations 
discover what the consumer wants 
and then ultimately supply what 
they want. 

IPFW has its own market 
research department headed by Dr. 
Zoher E. Shipchandler. It aids area 
businesses and organizations in pin- 
pointing their marketing problems 
and shows them ways to market 
their products better. 



The marketing research depart- 
ment has taken on projects for 
Wendy's, Colonial Homes, United 
Way, YMCA. IPFW Alumni 
Associarion and Uni-mist. An 
organization contacts the depart- 
ment on campus when it has a mar- 
keting problem. They then use the 
data to design a marketing strategy. 
According to Dr. Shipchandler. "the 
projects arc designed to measure 
customer perception, altitude, per- 
formance and behavior." 

Surveys are generally done 
through the mail or over the tele- 
phone. People are randomly select- 
ed based on the subject being 
researched to make sure the general 
population is represented. People 
are chosen from different ages and 
races, both male and female, to 
make sure results are represented 
more accurately. It is the responsi- 
bility of the marketing/business stu- 
dents to conduct each research pro- 
ject completely from start to finish. 

Students conduct their research 
in teams of four. The out of pocket 
expenses such as printing costs and 
interviewers, arc funded by the 
company contracting the project. 

Marketing and business majors 
are required ot take the marketing 
research class, which is offered 
both semesters. "The purpose is to 
teach students research methodolo- 
gy," states Shipchandler. 

Many students enjoyed the mar- 
keting class and got a lot out of it. 
Lisa Krager. a marketing and man- 
agement major, states, "It prepared 
me lo interview. I feel more self- 
confidenL" 

Steve Cochran, who was one of 
the team mambers doing research 
for 2nd Time Around Sports, com- 
mented, "It allows you to be more 
creative." 

Shawm Neumann, who did 



research for Colonial Homes, said 
"there is a generalization about 
marketers — they pull the wool over 
your eyes." 

Whether that's true or not, these 
marketing students encourage peo- 
ple to get involved. Neumann says, 
"I would definitely encourage it. It 
gives you a good background." 

Heidi Current, also a marketing 
major, says, "I learned a lot and 
encourage people to get involved " 

So whether you're a marketing 
or business major, or if you dicide 
to take a marketing class as an elec- 
tive, you know you'll gain experi- 
ence that will prove invaluable in 
the business world.

SEXUAL HARASSMENT WALL 

IPFW is a community composed of a diverse group of people striving to meet a variety 

of goals and expectations. Unique and individual qualities can create friction. 

Our differences can create rivalry, fear, and hatred. 

Building a positive environment where everyone can grow is important. In an effort to 

create a just and caring institution the Dean of Students Office, Affirmation Action/Equal 

Opportunity Office, the Center for Women and Returning Adults, Students' Government, 

and Police and Safety will be sponsoring the "Sexual Harassment Wall" 

during Safety Awareness Week. 

Personal experiences, a commentaries, or an observation regarding sexual harassment 

as it relates to our campus (for example, a classroom situation or a campus office), will be on 

display in the Kettler Hall Display Case (second floor) during the week of October 17-23.

Depression Sufferers: 
Where to go 



Jamie Craver 
Features Writer 

With the cold and often dreary 
weather of fall and winter, there 
also comes a distinct feeling of 
melancholy for many. But for 
some, this is a year-round feeling 
thai gnaws away at their spirits and 
will to live, and often worsens or 
develops during the cold months 
ahead. 

This problem is known as 
depression, and is one of the most 
common and treatable of all mental 
illnesses. Anyone can develop this 
illness, and it is often overlooked 
or not seen as a life-threatening ill- 
ness, but depression is the leading 
cause of all suicides. 

There are many symptoms that 
can be signs that a friend or loved 
one is suffering from depression. 

Noticeable changes in appetite 
or sleeping patterns are good clues 
that someone may be experiencing 
deep depression. 

If a friend or loved one seems to 
lose interest in activities that they 
usually enjoy, or has abnormal 
feelings of fatigue, that is another 
sign of depression. Feelings of 
hopelessness and inappropriate 
guilt may also warn that a loved 
one is depressed. 

A person is in need of immedi- 
ate help if be or she give any hints 
of having thoughts of death or sui- 
cide or talks about disturbing 
thoughts that are not based on real- 
ity. 

Overwhelming feelings of con- 
stant sadness and grief, and physi- 



cal symptoms such as headaches or 
stomachaches are also big indica- 
tors that the person is in need of 
help very soon. 

Suicide is the eighth leading 
cause of deatb in America and the 
third leading cause of death among 
1 5 to 24 year olds who are primari- 
ly made up of high school and col- 
lege students who have feelings of 
stress from school and an unsure 
future. 

Early recognition and awareness 
is the best way to prevent suicides, 
and if you know anyone who may 
be suffering from depression, don't 
be afraid to show your concern and 
recommend counseling for them. 

A free depression screening test 
is available at IPFW Thursday, 
Oct. 13 in room G21 in Walb at 12 
noon, but if you miss it, then there 
are a number of consultation cen- 
ters and psychiatrists that special- 
ize in the treatment of people suf- 
fering from depression. You can 
also call Koala Counseling Center 
in Fort Wayne at 436-0690 to gel 
information en depression treat- 
ment or free consultation. 

Between eighty and ninety per- 
cent of all depressed people who 
seek treatment respond to the treat- 
ment, and nearly all who receive 
the treatment see at least some 
relief from their symptoms, 

If you know someone who 
might be suffering from this ill- 
ness, or if you are, then seek the 
help that is available before anoth- 
er senseless loss of life occurs lhat 
could have been prevented

Volunteerism Strikes at IPFW

How Much Do You 
Know About H.E.R.? 



Kara Whiting 
Features Editor 

How many of us can honestly soy 
that wc have volunteered for our com- 
munity at some point in our lives? I 
could be wrong, but my guess is not 
many of us could; and, according to 
Mary Brant, coordinator of student 
employmont, not too many student 
organizations can, cither. 

The Student Employment Center is 
looking for volunteer projects. Student 
organizations may present their respec- 
tive proposals for consideration. Upon 
approval, each student organization will 
be awarded a grant to further their pro- 

An example of past projects have 
included Delia Gamma Sorority's and 
Alpha Phi Alpha Fratcrity's easier Egg 
Hunt, which brought in inner city youth 



to participate. 

There is a problem with current 
volunteerism here at IPFW: "Part of the 
problem is that not all organizations are 
aware." Brant said. 

But students are not the only ones 
who volunteer here at IPFW. Charles 
Washington, associate director of career 
services, is currently a member of the 
Big Brothers/Big Sisters organization of 
Fort Wayne. He has a one-on-one 
match and also works on the organiza- 
tion's Mentor Project. 

The Mentor Project was designed to 
match up one male adult with three 
youth The main focuses of the project 
are education, career planning, anti- 
drug education, and sclf- 

"I think it helps me 



feel belter about giving back to die 

Washington. 

So if you or your student organiza- 
tion are interested in volunteering, then 
contact Mary Brant if funding is need- 
ed. If you do not need funding, then go 
out there and go for it! 

Volunteering at IPFW is a new 
series at The Communicator. In future 
issues there will be profiles done on 
certain people or groups of people who 
have demonsuated superior community 
acts of volunteerism. If you know of 
anyone at IPFW who volunteers to

"We have nothing 
to lose," says Brogan 



By Eric Butler 
Sports Editor 

The IPFW Women's Tennis 
Team won both of its matches on 
Saturday, Oct. 1, against Northern 
Kentucky 5-2, and Lewis 9-0. Two 
matches with Northern Kentucky 
were suspended due to darkness. 
The team improved its conference 
record to 4-4, and is looking good 
going into the tournament. 

Coach Brogan spoke hopefully 
about the upcoming GLVC 
Tournament. 

"St. Joe is clearly (he favorite 
coming into the tournament, but 
Indianapolis, Bcllarmine and 
Northern Kentucky arc all threats to 
win. If wc can get everyone lo play 
a little bit above their game then I 



think we can pull off a few upsets," 
Brogan says. 

Although Brogan doesn't think 
thai the team has played up to its 
potential, he docs believe that he 
has a very solid number one dou- 
bles team. 

Coach Brogan also talked about 
preparations in practice for the tour- 

"We're going to do a few things 
differently this week in practice. 
We'll watch some videos, do some 
drills in practice, and try to get the 
whole learn focused on the culmi- 
nation of this season. We have to 
gel more focused this week and 
start playing like there's nothing to 
lose. The pressure is definitely on 
the other teams," Brogan says.

Dear Super Dave: 

Who's got the bcsl chance at 
winning the Big Ten in college 
football ihisyear? 

•Curious IPFW Studeni- 
Dear Curious one: 

This year's Big Ten is more like 
the big two! The only two learns 
with a shot of winning it arc 
Michigan and Penn State. Yes, 
that's right, the eleventh team of 
the Big Ten, Penn Stale, will most 
likely run away with the crown. 
Michigan is the only real obstacle 
in their way, but that's a pretty big 
obstacle. 



Dear Super Dave: 

I'm responding to one of your 
little remarks concerning baseball. 
Baseball is a pan of America's his- 
tory. It has a lot of meaning to 
some people. How can you say that 
it's dying? 

-Saddened Baseball Fan- 
Dear Saddened One: 

I'm sorry but baseball has no 
place in the 20lh Century. Just 
watching one mind-numbing game 
almost puis me in a coma! I've just 
made a new rule. No more baseball 
questions. Every lime I think of 
baseball I have to go out and buy a 
fifth of whiskey.

By Eric Butler 
Sports Editor 

The Women's IPFW Volleyball 
Team is 1 1-9 (4-2 in the conference) 
and comes off two big wins this past 
weekend. On Friday, Oct. 7, IPFW

The younger players also con- 
tributed to the victory. Rcichhart and 
Luben played great on defense and 
racked up a total of eight digs. Porch 
was effective on offense with (en kills, 



and picked up the defense with seven 
digs. 

On Friday, Sept. 30, IPFW lost a 
close match to Lewis and won on 
Saturday against St. Joe. Coach 
Heffron (ricd a new 5-1 offense 
against Lewis With Julie Parrot selling 
instead of passing. The offensive 
change resulted in a defeat, but proved 
to rack up the highest team hilling per-

Women had their opportunities to win

OIL JUNKIES? 



Face it. 

We are a nation of fossil-fuel junkies. And we are pushing this energy- 
narcotic on our children. 

Unless we break our oil habit, we doom the next generation to a 
lifetime of fossil-fiiel dependency The symptoms arc easy to spot. 
An insatiable craving for gasoline. Disregard for the environment, 
An obsession with maintaining unstable oil supplies at any cost. 

But we can break this addiction without painful withdrawal. By 
driving less. Demanding more fuel -efficient cars. Investing in energy 
technologies that fuel our economy but keep the environment clean. 

It's the only way to keep today's children from becoming tomorrow's 
oil junkies.

-, ^^ Diet 



fA&lt; 



By Dawn Ramsey, R.N. 
Guesl Writer 

"Drink your milk so you'll 
grow big and strong," our 
mothers used to say, adding, 
"It's good for you." for addi- 
tional reinforcement. Children 
are natural skeptics, and we 
tended to defy such maternal 
advice unless it was accompa- 
nied by scientific proof or 
threats of banishment to our 
rooms. But now, years later, 
many of us are saying the same 
thing to our own children: 
"Drink your milk. Or else." 

It seems that each successive 
generation is becoming 
smarter, and threats of "go to 
your room" have become inef- 
fective since the advent of 
GameBoy, so we must arm 
ourselves with the facts to 
answer the inevitable "Why?" 
when we tell our children to 
drink their milk. 

Lo. and behold, there is 
indeed scientific evidence thai 
drinking milk is good for you. 
Milk, an excellent source of 
calcium, actually does make 
our bones strong, preventing 
osteoporosis in later years. 
Armed with some insight into 
the problem of osteoporosis, 
there are steps we can take, 
regardless of age, to prevent or 
slow its progression. 

Osteoporosis afflicts 24 mil- 
lion Americans 

Osteoporosis is the most 
common skeletal disorder in 
the world. It is one of the most 
serious and debilitating health 
problems older people face. 

Twenty-four million 

Americans have osteoporosis, 
and over 50 percent of women 
over age 45 and 90 percent of 
women over age 90 are afflict- 
ed with it. 

Osteoporosis is a disease 
whereby bone mass is lost, 
gradually and without symp- 
toms, over many years. 
Normally dense bone structure 
is lost, leaving brittle, weaker 
bones that have a honeycomb 



appear- 
ance. When this 
happens, the skeletal 
framework cannot with- 
stand mechanical stresses 
and fractures may then occur 
easily. 

Osteoporosis is the cause of 
1.3 million fractures annually 
in people over age 45. 

Hip fractures are probably 
the best known result of osteo- 
porosis, but fractures can occur 
nearly anywhere in the body. 
Fractures of the spine, ribs or 
arms may occur with little or 
no injury, and can cause long 
term pain and impaired body 
functioning. 

Thirty percent of people 
with osteoporotic hip fractures 
die from complications, while 
30-50 percent of the survivors 
never return to their previous 
level of functioning. One half 
of the people who sustain 
osteoporotic hip fractures are 
unable to walk again. 

All of these complications 
present some broad economic 
implications-the direct and 
indirect costs of caring for 
these patients is $7 billion-$12 
billion a year, 

Who's at risk? 

Many factors influence our 
risk for osteoporosis. First of 
all, men have a big advantage 
in this department. Osteporosis 
occurs six times more often in 
women than men. Women are 
at greater risk because absorp- 
tion of calcium into the bone 
requires certain hormones, 
which for women after 
menopause, are greatly 
reduced. Blacks have lower 
incidences of osteoporosis due 
to greater bone mass at all 
ages. Caucasians with northern 
European heritage are at higher 
risk than those with ties to 
southern Europe and the 
Mediterranean. People suffer- 
ing from any type of chronic 
illness are also at greater risk 
for osteoporosis due to poorer 
nutritional status and decreased 
levels of activity. People who 
smoke, have a high caffeine 
intake, or drink alcohol to 
excess are also at greater risk. 

Nutritional status is a major 
factor in attaining as well as 
maintaining adequate bone

hailed The Salvation Army kettles 
as "the newest and most novel de-

100 years after the first kettle was 
set out, instead of just providing 
Christmas dinner, the money 
raised is also used to provide gro- 
cery checks so families can buy and 
prepare their own dinners at home. 
And this is important when times

mass. 
that 
are low in calci- 
um, low in Vitamin D, 
high in protein, or high in fat 
make one more vulnerable to 
osteoporosis. 

A Plan for Prevention 

The number one thing to 
remember here is that osteo- 
porosis is not an old person's 
disease! It is a disease of the 
young that is not manifest until 
old age. Since there is no 
proven effective treatment for 
established osteoporosis, pre- 
vention is essential. 

While some risk factors can- 
not be changed, such as sex 
and race, other risks can be 
minimized. 

There are some very impor- 
tant measures you can take 
now to prevent osteoporosis. 
The earlier you start, the better. 

All of the experts agree that 
adequate calcium intake is cru- 
cial in the fight against bone 
loss. Teenagers and pre- 
menopausal women need 
between 800-1200 mg. of cal- 
cium daily, yet research indi- 
cates that most women fall 
short of this intake. 

Three 10-oz. glasses of skim 
milk supplies 1,000 mg. of cal- 
cium. Other good sources of 
calcium include: sardines, ice 
milk, ice cream, cheeses, soy, 
navy, and pinto beans, and 
broccoli. Calcium supplements 
should not be considered a sub- 
stitute for a diet rich in calci- 
um, but may be helpful in 
increasing bone mass. 

The next step toward healthy 
bones is regular weight -bearing 
exercise. Beneficial exercises 
include walking, hiking, tennis, 
and ballroom dancing. Three 
important points to remember 
with exercise are: any exercise 
is better than none; it's never 
too late to start; and, choosing 
a form of exercise you really 
enjoy is ideal because you 
should continue it throughout 
your lifetime. And, as with any 



diet or exercise pro- 
gram, you should 
consult your health 
care provider for 
additional 
counseling. 
Researchers 
have been 
investigating 
several different 
treatment modalities for 
osteoporosis. Estrogen replace- 
ment for those who are post 
menopausal has been very 
effective in reducing the 
amount of bone loss if started 
within three years of 



menopause. Estrogen can be 
taken orally, by injection, or 
transdermally by wearing a 
patch. 

Other treatments include 
Sodium flouride, which is 
under investigation for it's 
bone-forming potential. 
Calcitonin is an injectable med- 
icine that has been shown to be 
helpful for acute, painful or 
vertebral fractures. These 
agents arc available only 
through your doctor or are still 
in experimental stages, and 
again, have limitations to their 



So there you have it: Scientific 
evidence proves that your 
mother was right! We really 
should drink our milk and get 
our exercise — to help prevent 
osteoporosis. 

Start now to improve the 
quality of your life in later 
years. And you might want to 
thank your mother for giving 
you some advice.
