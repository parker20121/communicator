n scheduling classes to 
•nance, 1PFW officials 
mis have suggestions 



because of the OASIS system - 
students can sign up almost 24 
hours a day. The rare exceptions 
are during OASIS maintenance. 
Students can still regisier now 
through Jan. 14. 

The highest traffic, he said, 
is usually during the first week 
of the semester when students 
are adding and dropping classes. 
McLaughlin advises students to 
ith their advi- 

before making drastic 
changes to their schedule. 

He suggest that if students 
need to change their schedule, 
they should do it quickly. 
McLaughlin said dial if u stu- 
dent is dropping a class lo keep 
Ihe one they have in their sched- 
ule until they get into the one 
that dicy want. Thai way if they 
drop a class before they sign up 
for another the class will 
become available lo someone 
else. 

With the OASIS system, 
he adds, someone else may be 
trying to gei die same class as 
someone else. The problem is if 
there is only one spot open. 
There is a chance lhal the other 
person will get it.

He adds that students 
should not follow them too

BPFW engineering 
contest starts again 



By IPFW News Se) 



For the last three semes- 
ters students in the ETCS 101 
and ENGR 101 classes have 
formed teams and come up with 
ideas on ways to improve life at 
IPFW. 

As a part of the project, 
each team has to design and 
execute a poster oudining their 

This semester's posters 
went on display Monday, Dec. 
6, in Walb Student Union. 

Each poster will outline 
the need for improving a specif- 
ic area of campus, potential 
the students' pre- 



ferred solution and tl 



tfor 



implementing that change (not 
to exceed $1,000.) 

The students compete 
against each other to see which 
three projects will be selected 
by the judges and then imple- 
mented. The posters will be on 
display all week. 

The poster project is the 
brainchild of ETCS dean 
Gerard Voland. 

Voland says a project like 
this gives engineering students 
a real idea of what engineering 
can mean in the everyday 
world. The three teams whose 
projects are chosen by tile 
judges will get their team 
names engraved on a permanent 
plaque.

Your place would be perfect. 



It is no small miracle that the God of the universe was willing to leave heaven and be bom in a lowly, obscure 

stable in a Middle Eastern town. But perhaps an even greater wonder is that the same God is willing to come 

into the dirt and filth of our lives. Why? To bring healing, forgiveness and wholeness. He's not waiting for you to 

clean up your stable or to make your life more acceptable to him. Just ask any of us how Jesus has changed our lives.

Letter to the Editor: 

American 

Smokeout 

coverage 

raised 

students' 

awareness 

Thank you so much for 
the great article in The 
Communicalor on the Great 
American Smokeout "Stop 
Smoking" Block Party and all 
the important information to 
help more people think about 
stopping tobacco use! More 
than 500 people attended the 
party; 258 "stop smoking" kits 
were passed out! 

Using tobacco products 
does not solve stress problems 
or help the budget, and . is not 
sexy. It primarily hurts your 
health. Once someone kicks 
the habit they're breathing bel- 
ter, blood pressure improves, 
chance of heart attack decreas- 
es, risk for colds/flu is reduced 
and clothes do not stick. The 
quality of life increases! 

If you're ready to be free 
of smoking call 481-6647 or

Mr. Lawson goes to Bloomington 

This paper marks the last issue produced with Scott Lawson as the 
editor-in-chief. He has been serving in this capacity for the last three 
semesters, a tenure practically unheard of in student newspapers, with 
staff that come and go very quickly. 

Lawson's previous journalism experience has benefited The 
Communicator in countless ways, as well as his organization and lead- 
ership. He will he missed. 

He will be continuing with a journalism degree at Indiana 
University in Bloomington. We wish him the best and a fond farewell. 



Tragedies reminds us 
of our own mortality 

Within a week, two IPFW students were taken before their time'. Ben 
Wiegman, 23, passed away on Nov. 30 from a heart condition. Stacy 
Cox, 20, died from a fatal car crash on Nov. 22. 

The illusions of youth often create a sense of invincibility and a false 
belief that we are able to control the world around us. But in the face of 
tragedy, all such notions disappear and we are reminded of our tenuous 
connection to life. 

The truth is, we are not immune to death, though we often grow cal- 
lous to its proximity. We are human, and there is a no more sobering 
reminder than the sorrow of young lives lost. 

It is obvious that both students loved life. Wiegman's heart ailment 
rendered him cognizant of his own mortality, and though Cox's health 
was normal, nor did she take her life for granted. 

Each of these students knew what they wanted from life, and worked 
tirelessly to achieve their goals. Cox led a full and active social life and 
possessed a creative spirit. Wiegman gave to his community through 
service in the church and was engaged in local politics. They were happy 
with their lives—and that is more of an achievement than many people 
twice their ages. 

It is no question that they were taken before their time, and a period 
of mourning will be observed. But in the midst of this tragedy, one 
should remember the the example set by these young people.

wanted to try again. And I am 
truly happy I did. 

This semester has taught 
me things about being a writer. 
For one, deadlines. Now I 
know how to make a deadline; 
I've done it throughout school 
all my life. I know how to be on

even how to manage my time

So you're caught between 
getting a column in by Friday 
and getting a good column in by 
Friday. While simply rushing 
to have something done, you 
lose the quality. Because of this 
problem, I received my first 
"Letter to the Editor." 

I will be the first to admit 
that the column I wrote con- 
cerning "ALL" freshmen was a 



of it. But that's exactly what 
happened. 

In fact, I'm considering 
framing the letter which 
claimed that I single-handedly 
caused a student to quit reading 
The Communicator altogether. 
It makes me proud. Not 
because I want people to stop

Windsong film deadline is Jan. 15 



Film festival 
slated to take

By David C. Hunter 



"The goal of Windsong Pictures is to reach out, 

touch others, and make a difference. Everything 

centers and focuses around that." 



Michael Floyd 



Sixth Annual International 
Windsong Film Festival is 
approaching, and you can still 
enter your student film - pro- 
vided your work aligns with 
Windsong's overall vision. 

"The goal of Windsong 
Pictures is lo reach out, touch 
others, and make a difference. 
Everything centers and focutcs 
around that." Michael Floyd, 
the company's executive pro- 

The deadline for the film 
festival is Jan. 15. After review- 
ing applicants' submissions. 
Windsong's board of mostly 
local film connoisseurs will 
pick the films lo be screened 
from May 7 lo 13 al IPFW. 

Floyd notes only certain 
films are accepted for the fesii- 



said. "That means that the 
teni cannot be sexually 
exploitive, there's no nudity, 
language has to be clean, there's 
not graphic violence. If I can't 
take my grandchildren to the 
film. \ 



Floyd explained he and students 
have had several opportunities 
to speak with the Indiana bom 
director of acclaimed movies 
such as "Hoosiers" and "Rudy.'' 
"One of the students a few 
years ago asked him . . . this was 
a number of years ago because 
'Touched by an Angel' was a 
fairly good show at the time 
. 'Do you think we're going to 
see more family-friendly films 
coming out of Hollywood?' and 






ated from the films came from 
within our borders. Now. 70 to 
75 percent of the revenue a film 
produces is overseas," he quol- 
ed P1//0 as saying. 

Floyd said, and he agrees, 



have lost input as to how much 
graphic violence and sexuality 
is now shown because other 
countries are looking for it. It is 
a business, they believe. 

"Are there Americans that 
still want (graphic violence and 
sexuality)? Yes. obviously," he 
said. "But it's the foreign mar- 
ket that's driving Hollywood, 
there's no question about that, 
that's not my opinion that's just 

1 Even graphically violent 
yet critically acclaimed films 
like "Saving Private Ryan" 
would be rejected by Windsong. 
Not for its message, but for its 
visually and emotionally dis- 
turbing content. 

"It was very touching, 
very moving," Floyd admitted, 
"and it certainly depicts the 
kinds of thing that happened, it 
really did, and is there a place 
for that? Yes. but is there a place 
for that in Windsong Pictures*' 
No." 

Allison Pareis and David 
Page are two students who 
worked together on a film enti- 
tled "Don't Speak," which

The two originally created 
the film for a media class at 
IPFW, and when Pareis heard 
aboui the festival, she called 
Page and they decided to enter. 

Pareis embraced 

Windsong's mission, and 
thought it was a great idea. 

"(It's) not a lot of the 
obnoxious lype stuff that pro- 
motes sex and violence, (it's) 
kind of friendly things that kids 
could watch - not anything hor- 
nhle or gruesome." 

Pareis is a telecommuni-

and he's thinking about entering 
again this year,

The DeepNines Security 
Edge Platform serves as the 
single, centralized network 
security and traffic manage- 
ment system for an entire 
organization and integrates 
firewall, intrusion prevention, 
secure content management, 
forensics and reporting. 

The platform is config- 
ured during installation to 
identify and stop exploits that 
could be developed by hackers 
to lake advantage of vulnera- 
bilities like this. Additionally. 
using DeepNines' Adaptive 
Rate Control and intelligent

"From our point of view, 
this has been a tough couple 
of weeks for Cisco. Just last 
week a group of hackers 
advertised their Pix firewall 
source code for sale and now 
DHCP, which provides a basic 
service request within routers, 
is further exposing their 
routers," said Dan Jackson 



COO and president of 
DeepNines. 

"These targeted attacks 
against Cisco won't relinquish 
any time soon because hackers 
have proven to focus on tech- 
nologies with the biggest mar- 
ket share. It's time we take 
security to the furthest point 
of the network and deploy a 
solution in front of the router. 
We are the only network secu- 
rity company that can offer 
router protection and are pre- 
pared to help secure the exten- 

hold" 

In addition to deploying 
the Security Edge Platform in 
front of the router. DeepNines 
professional services group 
recommends a work around 
by applying ACL's to the 
router to stop this type of 
behavior or upgrade the IOS. 



ACL's 

decrease the performance of 
the router and is only a tempo- 
rary solution. 

DHCP, which configures 
both private and dynamic host 
configuration, is a basic servr 
ice request within Cisco 
routers and by default is con- 
figured to accept both of these 
packets and forwards DHCP 
and BootP packets across sep- 
arate broadcast domains. 

The problem is thai 
Cisco routers are configured 
by default to accept DHCP 
packets and a command "serv- 
ice dhep" will not appear on 
the configuration display. 
However, the only command 
that is visible and will disable 
this feature is "no service 
dhep," which will ihen appear 
on the configuration display. 
Ultimately, certain DHCP 
packets will remain undeliver- 
able, but will remain in the 
queue instead of being 
dropped. For example, if a 
number of packets are sent 
that equal the size of the input 
queue, no more traffic will be 
accepted and a Denial of 



Ethernet interface. Address 
Resolution Protocol times out 
after a default lime of four 
hours, and no inbound or out- 
bound traffic can be 
processed, including both IP 
and non-IP traffic such as 
IPX. The device must be 
rebooted to clear the input 
queue on the interface, and 
will not reload without user 
intervention. If the attack is 
repeated on all interfaces, it 

cessible. 

"We find our newly 
announced relationship with 
DeepNines timely as the 
events unfolding are demon- 
strating how the edge router is 
a known point of vulnerability 
for almost any network," said 
Babak Pasdar, Founder and 
chief information security 
officer of igxglobal.

On the next offensive pos-
