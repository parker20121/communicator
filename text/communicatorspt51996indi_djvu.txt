IPSGA fights rollerblading ban 



by Nol Berkley 
Managing lCdilnr 



Today, students will be exercising 
their rights io assemble near 
Keuler Hall when Ihey protest 
an attempted ban on rollerblad- 
ing by Ihe University Resource Policy 
Committee (URPC). 

The ban was passed in the summer with- 
out student input, according to George 



Gounaris, Indiana Purdue Student 
Government Association (IPSGA) presi- 
dent. 

The ban will not be implemented until 
the Faculty Senate votes on the measure on 
Sept. 9 Safety was the most important issue 
concerning the rollerblading ban, according 
to Lauren Denhartog. chief of university 
police. 

"Hopefully we can persuade the faculty 
not to rubber siamp the university's propos- 
al and side with the students," Gina 



Burgess. IPSGA's senate pro lem, legisla- 
tive affairs chair and media coordinator 
said. 

If there is a large turnout for the rally, 
Gounaris said the students will have lever- 
age if the faculty senate approves the ban. 
That leverage will be taken to Purdue-West 
Lafayette. 

"If there is a low turnout, we will have 
no recourse at Purdue," Gounaris said. 

Gounaris said the purpose of the rally 
was to generate student support lor 



Fraternity members donate 
time to community center 



by Jeremy Ecenbarger 
News Editor 



Community involvement 
comes in many shapes and 
sizes. From Big Brothers, Big 
Sisters to the United Way. lend- 
ing a hand still holds value in 
today's society Just ask the 
members of the Sigma Phi 
Epsilon fraternity. 

Together Everyone 

Accomplishes More (TEAM) is 
a program created by members 
of the fraternity that promotes 
getting people to work together 
in order to make a difference. 

For their first project, twelve 
members of the fraternity 
donated their time on August 
24 to help the Euell A Wilson 
Center by assisting residents of 
teighborhood with clean-up 
and bcautificaiion of the area. 

The Euell A. Wilson Center, 
located at 1512 Oxford Street, 
offers various programs that 
help area youth grow physical- 
ly, mentally and emotionally. 
Some of the programs include 
tutoring, personal development, 
cultural education, mentoring, 
counseling and family develop- 
ment The center runs on a 
womb-to-lomb" philosophy. 
Young children are invited to 
participate in the variety of pro- 



grams and are encouraged to 
remain acuve throughout their 
lives. 

"We had a great time," said 
Kevin Orthman. a member of 
Sigma Phi Epsilon. 

Throughout the day, mem- 
bers of the fraternity helped 
clean streets and yards, as well 
as planted flowers and shrubs 
In the process, they were intro- 
duced to many of the children 
active at the center 

"They got more done than I 
even could have thought possi- 
ble." said Shirley Woods, presi- 



dent of Euell A. Wilson Center. 

According to Woods, the 
children enjoyed spending the 
day with the fraternity mem- 
bers. Along with cleaning the 
area, the students played sever- 
al games with the children 
Members of the fraternity also 
answered many questions the 
center's employees had about 
new computer software. 

Mary Brant, coordinator of 
Indiana Campus Contact, 
helped organize and supervise 
the program, which was 
designed to help everyone 



involved by enhancing personal 
development, developing lead- 
ership skills, raising self-esteem 
and increasing pride and respect 
for members of the greater 
community. 

"it really went to show bow 
IPFW students contribute their 
time to Ihe community," said 
Brant. 

Currently, Sigma Phi Epsilon 
and the Euell A Wilson Center 
arc trying to make a regular 
schedule of future occasions the 
two organizations can work 
together again.

rollerblading on campus. 

"The solution that they 
(URPC) have agreed upon is not 
equitable to the students," 
Gounaris said. 

Gounans sajd he met with 
Denhanog to discuss alternatives 
to the ban. 

Denhartog said the previous 
policy left too much up to inter- 
pretation on both sides of the 
issue. 

"The policy we had was not 

easily enforced," Denhanog said. 

According to Denhanog's policy pro- 
posal, skateboarding will be completely 
banned from IPFW. Rollerblading would be 
restricted on campus to weekend daylight 
hours. 

"If we could somehow teach all the 
rollerbladers how to use common sense, we 
wouldn't need this policy," Denhanog said. 

Most of the rollerbladers around campus 




are responsible but there are a 
few who damage property and 
endanger students and staff. 
Denhanog said. 

Gounaris' proposal also 
bans skateboarding but allows for 
rollerblading during certain 
weekday hours. Gounans' mea- 
sure allows for rollerblading dur- 
ing all daylight hours in parking 
lot one. 

Gounaris pointed out that 
although safety is a main factor in 

the ban, both Indiana University and Purdue 

University have 20.000 more students and 

bave not banned rollerblading 

Denhartog said a majority of the calls his 

office receives concern rollerbladers and 

safely. 

"We've had an awful lot of complaints 

from students, staff and faculty," Denhartog 

said. 



E-mail upgrades; 
students dial-in 



by I'. ml Tupper 
Editor 

We may not have dorms. We may not 
have big name concerts. We may nol have 
protesters marching on the sidewalks of 
campus But we do have e-mail. 

Holmes, a computer system which runs 
the University of Washington's PINE elec- 
tronic mail program, was launched in March. 
The c-mad program is funded by the stu- 
dents under the technology fee on the billing 
statement Each student currently pays S3. 15 
per credit hour. 

At the end of the spring semester, only 
about 1,500 students had activated their 
accounts. That number continues to grow 
with the start of the fall semester 

"Many students didn't know what e-mail 
was," said Bill Baden, coordinator of acade- 
mic computing. "Now many classes are 
insisting students use e-mail for one reason 
or another." 

Angic Stone, junior, elementary educa- 



tion, uses her e-mail account frequently. 

"1 use it all the Line A lot of my friends 
go away to school and this is cheaper than 
calling them long distance," said Stone. 

New students were sent an e-mail I.D. 
and start-up kit from computing and data 
processing services Returning students who 
lost or discarded their Man-up kits or forgot 
their password can go to Kettler 205A for a 
new kit. Each student will be asked to show 
two forms of identification, a student l.D. 
and a photographed state I.D , both when 
notifying computer and data processing ser- 
vices and when receiving the new kits. The 
new kits are available 24 hours after initial 
request. 

Students can also dial-in from home 
computers by dialing 481-5484, 

Baden expects close to 80 percent of stu- 
dents will begin using campus e-mail in the 
next three weeks. 

"It's been designed for students It's 
there, they paid for it, it's theirs lo use," said 
Baden. 



Program provides opportunities for medical careers 



Many people find summer lo be 
a season of relaxation, a time to 
clear the mind. Yet. campus medical 
students may disagree because lor 
them it was a time of discovery. 

During the summer, the Indiana 
School of Medicine offered students 
the opportunity to receive valuable 
experience within the medical field. 
Two programs were available to 
allow students to do research and 
explore their preferred medical 
careers 

Students can complete up to two 
full years of medical school at 
IPFW. 

In July, a total of 22 students par- 
ticipated in research with local 
physicians in the Midwest Medical 
Research Foundation/Fort Wayne 



Center for Medical Exploration 
Student Summer Research program. 

The program matches student 
researchers in three fields; medi- 
cine, law and nursing. 

"We usually have twice as many 
applicants as there are slots." said 
Barth H. Ragatz, director of the Fort 
Wayne Center. "We try to choose 
the students who have promising 
medical school careers," Ragatz 
has been with the campus medical 
program for the List eight years. 

Students were matched with 
local physicians to assist in research 
projects One on one. the students 
were able to speak with the experts 
and listen to their ideas The pro- 
jects had various topics, including: 
basic science research, cardiology, 
cardiovascular surgery, emergency 
medicine, indigent care, medical 
ethics, neurology, orthopedics and 
pediatrics, among others. 

The students worked for nine 
weeks from mid-May lo early 



August and were each supported by 
a S2.2O0 stipend. 

One student dealt with the issue 
of a "smoke free" environment. 
Along with his mentor, the student 
did nicotine testing in several area 
restaurants that banned smoking 
from their huildings When the tests 
were completed, the results showed 
that the "smoke free" areas were 
only 3 to 5 limes lower in their nico- 
tine levels. The experimenters found 
that many restaurant employees and 
customers carried large amounts of 
nicotine on their clothing and else- 
where. They concluded that very 
few areas are truly smoke free 

According to Ragatz, 133 stu- 
dents have participated in the pro- 
gram since it began nine years ago. 
Of those, about one third were 
involved with physicians whose 
work resulted in material published 
or presented at national or interna- 
tional meetings. 

In addition. 16 undergraduates 



were pan of the Medical Career 
Program. Within the program, stu- 
dents were able to observe actual 
events that took place within sur- 
rounding medical centers. 

In small groups, the students 
spent each of four weeks in July in a 
"sphere of influence'' in the local 
medical community, observing 
opportunities in medical careers. 
The four spheres are Parkview 
Hospital. Lutheran Hospital. St. 
Joseph Medical Center, and a mix of 
the Veterans Administration 
Medical Center, Family Practice, 
Maithcw 25 Clinic and one other 
specialty. 

Students were able to witness 
everything from dental work, basic 
patient visits, even childbirth. 

The students attended lunches at 
IPFW to see how Ph.D. scientists 
work together in effecting clinical 
applications. They also received 
"nuts and bolts" information about 
medical school, heard doctors' testi- 



monials, participated in mock 
entrance interviews for medical 
school and kept journals of their 
experiences. 

"We have 90 premed students at 
IPFW alone," Ragatz said. The 
more familiar they are with the 
career opportunities in medicine, the 
belter. It's useful logo through this 
program even to find out you're not 
cut out for medical school." 

On August 5, a dinner event was 
held at the Walb Memorial Union 
Ballroom to review die summer pro- 
grams. Students presented posters 
and read papers to share their many 
memorable and interesting 
moments 

Ragatz usually notifies advisers 
about the program in as early as 
October and November The advis- 
ers get the interested students infor- 
mation and return it to him. Yet, any 
student who would like more infor- 
mation on die programs is welcome 
to call Ragau at 481-6731

This is not a fascist dictatorship 
and we do, as students, have rights. 
Look in the offices of many depart-

in nearly everyone of them that 
says, "Students are not an interrup-

why wc are here." 

We hope the faculty senate will 
remember those words when they 
vote on this measure September 9.

Is there life after graduation? 




fvJeremy 
Ecenbarger 



E?^*^ 1 *^ S*£* 



The future, the meaning of 
life, the importance of an 
individual . these are just a 
few of the things I contemplated on 
writing about when 1 was asked to 
write an opinion column. Yet, what 
I decided to do was just start typing 
and write what came to my mind. 
To be honest, (hat is a pre(ty dan- 
gerous idea. On the other hand, I 
realize that what I write about real- 
ly docs not matter, because after all, 
it's just my opinion 

To stan off, I will write about 
something that I, myself, really 
worry about. I am constantly asking day always brings another. 1 study 
myself, "What do 1 do from here?" I and study for tests, yet there's 
work in a large department store, bound to be another the nest day. I 
and everyday I see people who have go and go. but I really do not know 
such talent and good work ethics, where I am beaded, 
yet they choose to stay at iheir cur- Last year was my first at IPFW, 



rent place of 
employment. 
These people 
are not just nat- 
urally talent- 
ed — many have 
degrees from 
prominent uni- 
versities. 

Why do 
they choose to 
work at my 
department 
store? Several 
have educational degrees Still they 
do the exact same thing I am doing 
I wonder whether they actually 
enjoy their work, or are just settling 
for what is available. Is this what I 
will be doing in three or four years 
when I graduate? I hope not. 

I've always been one of those 
driven people that is willing to take 
on one more things. Arc all the 24- 
hour days worth the tiredness and 
hassle? I work and work, always 
striving to better my future. I often 
wonder if I ever live for the present. 
I work to pay off bills, yet the next 



and believe it or not, I survived. On 
the other hand, I know for a fact that 
this is only the beginning. I am a 
journalism major, therefore I cannot 
receive my degree solely from here 
But 1 have no idea where I am going 
to go next, I've always been afraid 
(o venture anywhere - and beyond - 
by myself, although I know there 
will be a time. Even though I live by 
myself. 1 have always been depen- 
dent on my family and friends. If 
they go, I go. However. I am a con- 
fident individual, and I know I can 
make it elsewhere 

I worry . I worry that all the 
dreams I have will never become 
realities There is no one holding me 
back from those dreamed adven- 
tures except myself I am not saying 
that I have any setbacks like perma- 
nent attachments, alcohol problems, 
or even financial difficulties I'm a 
pretly boring, ordinary guy - isn't 
that depressing? I am just afraid that 
I will not succeed. Somewhere 
inside myself. I realize that I am the 
only one who can really make that 
decision. Many times I think that I 
judge myself according to what 
other people think of me, and 1 
understand that is wrong. Although, 
we all know the appreciation of 
friends and family means a lot. 

I always thought life would be 



kept simple: high school gradua- 
tion, college, marriage, children 
Bin I guess if it was that simple it 
would not be interesting. Never did 
I imagine I'd be sweating on bow to 
gel bills paid, how hard it would be 
to decide what I wanted to do 
"when I grow up." worrying about 
how I would pay for my education 
and again wondering, "What do I do 
from here?" 

I guess what I'm trying to say is 
thai a person does not need to worry 
about things so much. Somehow 
things will fall into place. After all. 
we've made it this far Try noi lo 
study your life away, there's more 
important things than school If you 
fail a class, take it again Yet. don't 
fail too much, that can be expen- 
sive. A person should never be too 
serious; what kind of life would that 
be? Sure, you could be successful, 
but there may not be anyone waiting 
for you to turn it to when you're 
lonely. I'm noi saying to just wing 
every test or lo let those bills form a 
pile on your kitchen table, just do 
not let them rule your life. Live for 
the time at hand, for what is the 
future without a past to look back 
to 

Hey, this wasn't bad With some 
mumbling and a litde thought, it's a 
wonder that the mind can create. 



Democratic convention plays 
emotions game, fails to resolve issues 



Brant 
Kelley 




'The dangers of a never-think, 

only-hear citizenry are all too obvious. 

Those dangers were exposed during Hitler's 

rise to power in the early and 

mid-1 930's." 



The Democratic Convention 
came and went and with it 
went more of the appeal to 
man's thinking side as opposed lo 
its feeling side. 

True lo form, the party which 
supposedly represents the workers 
of this country, but does represent 
any lack of integrity where its chief 
executive is concerned, set out to 
strike the public's emouons. hoping 
the citizens would feel that the 
Clinton/Gore ticket is still right for 



this country. 

News 
flash, folks: 
lugging ai the heart strings may be 
great for feel-good speeches and 
trashy novels, but all the sob-story- 
ing and promises in the world won't 
solve this country's social problems 
or rescue it from the moral and 
political vacuum which has swept it 
from its moorings. 

Due to personal interests. I'll 
leave the Republican party 
untouched on this one! 

Everything about the convention 
appealed to people's desires, not 



their evaluations; the speeebwriters 
and speech givers presented their 
package in a way in which people 
could simply be swept away by 
hearing what they wanted to hear 
No speeches about personal respon- 
sibility; a tinge of What-You-Can- 
Do-For-Your-Country for purely 
nostalgic reasons. 

The dangers of a never-think, 
only-hear citizenry are all loo obvi- 
ous. Those dangers were exposed 
during Hitler's rise to power in the 
early and mid-1930's 

In stark contrast to the commu- 
nist nations behind the iron cunain, 



where (he public bad a planned 
economy and mode of thought 
foisted upon them, the German's of 
that era steadily succumbed to a 
system where they never had to 
think, but merely obey 

Today, emotional appeal hides 
behind noble enough motives: 
social awareness, compassion for 
your fellow man. But beware of the 
danger of letting someone's plead- 
ing lake over the nation's collective 
judgement; otherwise someone 
could go so far as even blame a race 
for the nation's problems.

Columnist realizes mistake, becomes quasi-feminist 




Lasl year. I penned the words 
"It's a man's world, gel 
used 10 it" Those words 
will always he associated with me 
for the rest of my college newspaper 
career. I deserve them. 1 wrote them. 
Some readers reacled somewhat 
violently, i.e. I was cursed. Others 
threatened me with some unnamed 
tonure. i.e. unsigned campus mail, 
Over the last year and especially 
during the summer. I began to 
rethink my position 1 read many 
books about philosophy and nurtur- 
ing your soul. (One of the books was 
even "The Skeptical Feminist" . . . 
shhhb don't tell anyone!) 

Unfortunately, this is still a 
mans world, Men control most of 
the businesses, mosi or the govern- 
ment and most of the world's reli- 
gions. Men have controlled these 



voice in politii 



institutions for 
the majority of 

wntien history. 
Even today, 
men seek io 
legislate what 
women can do 
with their bod- 
ies, their lives. 
In a per- 
fect world, 
which Earth 
will never be. 
women would 
have an equal 
business and reli- 
gion. For around ten millennia. 
western men have controlled 
women through vigorous interpola- 
tion of the Bible Women were 
bumed for centuries as witches. 
Those women's only crime was to 
believe in something other than a 
vengeful god who brought down fire 
and brimstone on his children. 

Think about it, would you, as a 
parent, willfully kill all your chil- 
dren because they did something 
wrong We're all God's children, 
right'? God flooded the earth and 
killed most of his children We're 
supposed io respect this God who 
has been forced down our throats for 
generations — a God who let his 
own son die a horrible death. Would 
any parent out there lei ihai happen 



to their own child? 1 know I would 
not, unless be was suffering If my 
only option to end my child's suffer- 
ing would be to free him or end bis 
life - 1 would. 

We live in a patriarchal society 
created by men who were jealous of 
women because they had the power 
to bring forth life Even though 
women possess this power, they 
have been discounted for the ten 
thousand or so years of the Bible. 
The Bible has men begetting men 
begetting more men with rarely a 
mention of a woman. 

Women have taken this abuse for 
millennia, and only within the last 
seventy years have women started to 
lake issue with their unfair lot in 
life. Women began io take charge of 
their life and vote in this country. 
Thirty years ago, women began to 
fight for "equal" rights. Their fight 
has been under constant aitack from 
Rush Limbaugh who calls them 
"Femi-Nazis." Millions of bleating 
sheep from the right follow his lead 
and repeal his gross overstatement. 
Baaaa Baaaaa Baaaa Baaaaaa ditto 
ditto ditto ferm-nazi femi-nazi femi- 
nazi. Equaling the women's move- 
ment with the national socialisl 
party in Germany is farcical, but 
millions of sheep believe ii because 
the greai god "Rush" said it.

Letter to the Editor 



Souder's 'independence' questioned 



To the editor; 

Recently, I noticed one of Rep. 
Mark Souder's campaign bumper 
stickers proclaiming the word 
"Independence" Politicians often 
use such feel-good words as a way 
of creating a positive association in 
ihe voter's mind. The real question, 
1 thought, is has this candidate 
demonsrraied "independence" dur- 
ing his two years in office? Is it 
clear from his voting record that 
Mark Souder is an independent 
thinker, an independent legislator? 
The answer, of course, is no. Far 
from the image he has attempted lo 
create as an independent leader, 
Mark Souder has consistently 
shown himself to be a typical politi- 
cian whose only loyally belongs to 
corporate big money and the party 
that helped him get elected Let's 
look at his record. . 

Souder would have us believe 
he weni io Washington as a new 
kind of politician, a congressman 
with courage and conviction. In 
reality, whatever courage he 
enjoyed was forfeited to Newt 



Gingrich the first day Congress 
convened, and his political convic- 
tion ended when he caught his first 
whiff of those big business dollars 

In fact, according to three sepa- 
rate studies. Mark Souder has voted 
in line with Newt Gingrich about 
90 percent of the time. The ihrec 
studies {which demonstrate 91, 87 
and 90.5 percent voting compatibil- 
ity between Souder and Gingrich) 
provide solid evidence that Souder 
went to Washington not to follow 
his conscience, but rather to follow 
the dictates of Newi Gingrich and 
the so-called Contract With 
America. Furthermore, the few dif- 
ferences that exist have arisen 
because Souder is even more 
extreme than Gingrich on allowing 
senior citizens and Ihe disabled to 
have pets in their government 
owned housing units. 

Thai Souder is emphasizing 
"independence" shows thai he is 
aware of how unpopular his posi- 
tions are in this district. Now he is 
attempting to moderate his image 
for the election's sake. However. 



the people of this district will not be 
duped again. It's time to fight back. 
It's time io elect a candidate who 
not only lalks about independence 
but also exhibits it It's time to elect 
Jerry Houseman.

had ihe power and look where ihe

Native American's are histori

someone who has 
dedicated his work to 
studying the Native 
American use of wild 
plants as medicines. 

The Botanical 
Conservatory will 
host Jim Meuninck, 
botanist and lecturer, 
(or a program on 
wild pi, mis and their 
uses on Saturday. 
September 28. 

Meuninck will dis- 
cuss and demon- 
strate how Native 
Americans use wild plants Tor food 
and medicine. 

Meuninck has worked with sev- 
eral Native Americans and studied 



their uses of wild plants He has also 
made several videos about wild and 
medicinal plants which will be 
available for purchase at the 
lecture 

Meuninck will 
share a historical per- 
spective on the use 
of plants as med- 
icine at this lec- 
ture. He will 
discuss the 
plants that 
have sup- 
plied Native

Medicine" in 
order to 

avoid "Big

sentation with healthful hints from 
400 years ago that can help you

"A lot of things he will be talking 
about are applicable today." Canales 
said "He will discuss the concept of 
food actually being medicine and

of the information found on his 
"Little Medicine" video. However, 
other videos thai will be for sale will 
deal with spiritual healing, natural

THE VOLUNTEER CONNECTION NEEDS YOU 



by Paul Tupper 
Editor 

Nothing looks better on a 
resume than job experience. 
Nothing except volunteer credits. 
Switchboard. Inc., an affiliate of the 
United Way, offers the chance lo 
obtain volunteer credits through the 
Volunteer Connection. 

The program works with non- 
profit organizations, public entities 
and grass-roots volunteer efforts to 
provide resources to help in aiding 
those in need. The agencies work 
with the Volunteer Connection to 
develop creative ideas for solving 
often complexing problems. 

As a volunteer, you will be help- 
ing in a number of ways, including 
managing, recruiting and training 
other volunteers. The Volunteer 
Connection provides training to the 



volunteer coordinators to help 
ensure each volunteer effort is suc- 
cessful. 

Aside from the benefits of 
resume-building, vol- 
unteering supplies you 
with the skills needed in 
most jobs such as diose 
just mentioned. But 
you can also walk 
away having 
built people 
skills and 
working your 
mind and 
body in ways 
unimaginable 

As if that 
wasn't enough, 
volunteering 
offers you the satis- 
faction of helping 
those in need. Providing 




others with on extra push is often all 
it takes to get someone on the right 
path. And you may gain new 
friends in the process, 

The Volunteer Connection 
also offers a Court Referral 
Program which places nonvio- 
lent, first-time offenders in 
organizations to complete 
community service resti- 
tution Working sidc- 
by-sidc with these indi- 
viduals, you can pro- 
vide guidance to 
someone whose life 
has gotten off course 
The Volunteer 
Connection is locat- 
ed in the United Way 
Building at 227 East 
Washington Boulevard.

Cinema Center celebrates SO years; 
pxiblishes book: about History 



"Recently we've been running a 
children's scries on Saturday after- 
noons, and we've also been showing 
some of Iho golden oldies, which 
generally attract an older crowd." 

The crowds have been gathering 
at ihe Cinema Center since lis open- 
ing in 1976. According io Ver 
Wiebe. die Cinema Center started 
showing films at 1PFW. 

'The first films were shown at 
the Art School auditorium when il 
was downtown on the comer of 
Berry and Rockhill Street," Ver 
Wiebe said. The location now hous- 
es the Arena Dinner Theatre 

Cinema Center actually started 
with Fort Wayne's celebration of the 
U.S. bicentennial. "There was 
money allocated for a showing of 
American films," Ver Wiebe said. 
After the good turnout for the bicen- 
tennial celebration, Ver Wiebe and a 
few others decided they wanted to 
continue showing films. 

For the first ten years the Cinema 
Center wenl without funds, so films 
were shown in a lot of different 
places. The new book will spotlight

The Fort Wayne Cinema Center 
is cclebraling its 20th anniversary 
by publishing "20 Reel Good 
Years," a compilation of films 
shown, as well as the different home 
sites occupied by the Cinema Center 
since its opening in 1976. 

The Cinema Center is a one-the- 
ater showcase for films generally 
not shown in commercial theater 
houses. According to Carol Ver 
Wiebe, founder and former board 
president, most films shown at the 
Cinema Center are indcpendcnl 
films, foreign films and documen- 
taries. 

"1 think a wide variety of age 
groups are interested in what we 
have here," Ver Wiebe said. Like at 
most theaters, the demographics of 
those who attend depend on the film 
being shown. 

"We have shown some 
Generation X-iypc films in the past 
year and we' ve had huge crowds out 
for them." Ver Wiebe said.

Changes made in honors program 



by Jeremy Ecenbarger 
News Editor 

While many students struggle to 
make il through iheir classes with a 
passing grade, there arc those who 
put themselves up to a tougher chal- 
lenge by taking honors courses. 

This year. Mailhew Kubik, asso- 
ciate professor of architectural engi- 
neering technology, has taken over 
the honors program and plans to 
"revitalize" the whole student orga- 
nization. This is the firsi time an 
engineering professor has become 
director of the honors program, 
liven though Kubik is new to the 
program, he has been a professor on 
campus since 1983. 

Kubik also developed the educa- 
tional travel program in Rome, Italy, 
Architecture Art and Urban Form, 
without any 1PFW institutional sup- 
port. He developed budgets, semi- 
nars, lodging, meals, transportation 
and guest lectures. He acts as lead 
teacher for a three-person instructor 
team teaching the course in Italy. 
The course is currently in its Fifth 
year and has been taken by students 
ranging in age from 18-70. 

"Honors courses have been 
spcciFically developed for students 
with higher academic standings or a 
higher motivation to learn." said 
Kubik. 

Eligibility for the program is that 
a student must have at least a 3.5 
GPA. If the student is new to the 
campus then they must have scored 
at least a 1200 on their SAT, While 
the numbers may seem high, 10 per- 
cent of the student body is involved 
with this program 

With the completion of the hon- 
ors program, in addition to the sub- 
stantial rewards of a unique type of 
learning, the student's transcript will 
show that he/she has taken the 
courses designed for the program. 
They are also awarded a certificate 
and medal that verifies a successful 



completion of iL 

Along with the new director, a 
new alternative process has been set 
up to further beneFit the students. 
The process is H-Option. It now 
gives students the opportunity to 
take a wider variety of classes, 
instead of the general classes that 
have always been available. 

"Students can take any course 
they're enrolled in and set up an 
individual course," said Kubik. 
'There is no additional work, but it 
expands on the course and gets 
deeper," 

In the fall of 1995, the honors 
program council piloled its Fust H- 
Oplion class with James Haw, pro- 
fessor of history, and HIST H105. 
Two students in the class made a 
contract with Professor Haw to do 
some class projects that were differ- 
ent from the rest of the class. When 
the semester concluded, the students 
received honors credit. 

This semester, nine professors 
are offering the H-Option to their 



students, and 13 students are partic- 
ipating. 

Not all classes offer the H- 
Option. During the first week of 
class, if the professor was willing to 
offer the program, he/she would 
have announced il and outlined the 
changes in the syllabus. If offered, 
the student has until the third week 
of the semester to let the professor 
know whether or not they will take 
the H-Option. A contract is then 
signed by the student, professor, the 
department chair and the honors 
director. Furthermore, paper work is 
done by the registrar to assure that 
the student receives honors credit. 

To complete the Honors 
Cenificale a student must take 18 
credil hours of honors courses. 
Three hours may be independent 
study while you do your honors pro- 
ject, only six hours may be H-option 
courses and the remaining nine 
hours must be in courses which are 
comprised of all honors students. 

A new honors student meeting is

also in the process that allows mem- 
bers of the program to leam with 
each other. This meeting is called 
the Honor Student Forum. 

'This is for students who want to 
meet with more highly-motivated 
students," said- Kubik. "They can 
meet friends and have open discus- 
sion." 

The Honors Program will be 
sponsoring its Fust event starting at 
the end of the semester. Along with 
the National Collegiate Honors 
Council, they will have a satellite 
seminar that has a wide variety of 
themes: Landscapes and Outdoor 
Spaces; The Portrait - Sculpture, 
Painting, Photography; The Film as 
an Art Form; Folk Art as a 
Reflection of Society and Patrons 
and Censorship in the Arts. All the 
presentations will be done in Kettler

Runners set to surprise 
conference, city 



by S. Bran! Kelley 
'■■ 1 1- ■ 1 1 Editor 

The 1PFW men's and women's 
cross country teams begin their sea- 
sons this Saturday at Indiana 
Weslcyan University. Neat week- 
end, iin. . will bost their first borne 
cross country meet in four years. 

Near the cellar of the Great 
Lakes Valley Conference the past 
few years, both the men's and 
women's teams look to climb up in 
the standings this year "This past 
year. 1 have recruited from the Fort 
Wayne area and out of slate." 1PFW 
cross country coach Judy 



Tillapaugh said, "We have some 
excellent recruits coming in on the 
guys side." 

Tillapaugh sees both the men's 
and women's teams finishing in the 
lop six in the GLVC this fall Both 
learns finished ninth in the confer- 
ence lasl year. This is quite a goal 
considering GLVC powerhouse 
Lewis University won the men's 
cross country national champi- 
onship last season The University 
of Wisconsin-Parkside took the 
GLVC women's title lasi season 

"I really think we have thai abil- 
iiy," Tillapaugh, in her first year, 
said "We have a strong assembly of 



men and women " 

Newcomers include Wayne 
High School graduate Steve Teusch, 
Indiana state 3,200-mcter champion 
last spring, Melanie Varner. part of 
Northrop High School's sixth-place 
J, 200-meter relay team last spring. 
and Kristin Minick, also from 
Northrop. 

Leading the newcomers for the 
men will be Adam Barton and 
Central Noble product David Footc. 
Madeleine Roser and Kay Pulver 
will lead the women this year. 
Pulver returns afler silling out dur- 
ing the 1994-95 school year. 




Cross country team members Madeline Roser, Mona Mourad. Kristine Minick, Melanie Vamer, Andrea

New tennis coach ready 
for tough conference 



by S BraniKelley 
Sports Editor 



Fail and the first semester of the 
school year has descended upon us 
as a siorm. And wiih it came J 
Webb Honon, new coach of the 
men's and women's tennis teams 

A native of Chicago, Honon 
arrived just two months ago lo an 
unfamiliar situation, 

And if he had his druthers, he 
would have been given a liltle more 
lime to line up bis ducks. "We lost 
some kids in that transition period," 
Honon said. 

He'll have a little more time for 
the men's team, which doesn't play 
a regular schedule until the spring, 
but the women start play tonight 
against Indiana Westeyan 
University. 

Honon is ready for the chal- 
lenge, though He has injected a 
new philosophy and a new playing 
style into this year's learns in order 
to make them competitive enough in 
the tough Great Lakes Valley 



Conference to pull out a league title. 

"We want to build a strong win- 
ning tradition." he said "That (win- 
ning the GLVCl may not be attain- 
able this year. Bui I think in two or 
three years, that's a very attainable 
goal for us." 

Consistency and desire will be 
the key, since the Mastodons don't 
field any future pros for the tour 

"If people come and see our 
malches, they're going to be there a 
long lime," be said "We have a lol 
of people who can keep the ball in 
play. 

"The girls have really worked 
hard. 1 cannot complain about the 
effon these girls have given me." 

Morton's vision includes not 
looking to the past as a measure of 
the present. 

"I don't care where we finished 
last year," he said. "This is the start 
of a new era ... It's a job. You can't 
get emotionally upset if you have a 
bad day." 

In Honon's world, his players 
are student-athletes As pan of an 
institution with a growing academic 



reputation, he demands his players 
represent IPFW well, even if class 
must interfere with practice sched- 
ules. 

"I'm not going to have kids miss 
class," Honon said. "It's just not fair 
to them." 

The women's first maich begins 
this afternoon at 3 p.m. They play 
again on Saturday at 3 p.m. against 
IUPUI.

Bid farewell lo one of the better 

basketball players on IPFW's men's 
team as Ryan Bond foregoes his 
final season lo get on with his life 
But donT weep too much; he's 
doing the nght thing for both him- 
self and his team. 

Before I take a former athlete's 
head off and then claim First 
Amendment immunities, I'll say 
Bond contributed well enough to 
otherwise mediocre Mastodon 
squads during his sophomore and 
junior seasons here. He was particu- 
larly integral to the '94-'95 team 
which started the non-conference 
season 2-7. but surprised everybody 
with eight league wins lo finish in 
the middle of the Great Lakes Valley 
Conference 

Bui what I saw near die end of 
lasi season indicates to me the 
Bond-Maslodon marriage was no 
longer viable. 

In a season marred by disap- 
pointing league action and occa- 
sional public flare-ups by the coach, 
IPFW's team hit rock-botlom. 
despite some ample talent The 
throes of a nine-win season and 
abounding questions concerning 
Piazza's coaching future sent the 
team's morale to an all -lime memo- 
rable low. 
Watching several average ballclubs 



cither outgun 
us or outwit us 
or just out- 
coach us. I 
increasingly 
noticed less 
game attention 
by the players 
and more clock 
watching when 
the times came 
repeatedly for 
sucking il up in 
the lasi five, or 
two. minutes 
real attempt at a 
come-from- behind win now and 
then. The Mastodons' victory over 
Kentucky Weslcyan after rebound- 
ing from a 17-poini deficit is a 
notable exception 

Watching a more typical 
matchup against Lewis University 
late in the season, I saw a tremen- 
dously gifted player who had lost 
interest in the game and wished he 



was elsewhere 1 hope be is where 
he warns to be now. presenUy taking 
18 credits to finish his leaching 
degree in the spring Getting his 
degree is more than a number of 
college athletes accomplish anyway 
At least he has a vision for his 
future Maybe coaching is where he 
should be; il will be a big help if his 
heart is already where his feet and 
plans are taking him.

Mastodons' soccer learn into a pow- 
erhouse. IPFW coach Terry 
Siefankiewicz has arranged

tournament. 

After the season's start at the 
IUPUI Classic against 1994 NAIA 
national champion West Virginia 
Wcsleyan University this weekend, 
the Mastodons host three division I 
schools as pan of the inaugural 
JPFW/Three Rivers Soccer Classic 
tournament next weekend at 
Memorial Stadium. 

Indiana University will head a 
cast of Division I powerhouses in 
what Siefankiewicz hopes will be a 
semi-annual tournament in Fort 
Wayne. Once Indiana University 
committed to the tournament, the 
other two schools, tbe University of 
Alabama- Birmingham and 

Marquette University, readily 
accepted invitations. 

Tournament matches begin at 



5:J0p.m. and 7:30pm both nights 
and IPFW students can watch free 
with a student ID 

IPFW sports a strong reluming 
cast from last year's 10-9 elub 
which finished Fifth in the Great 
Lakes Valley Conference. The rock 
upon which Siefankiewicz will 
build remains three-time, all- 
Mideast player Mike Harper This 
year, however, he may have a 
stronger supporting cast lo surround 
Harper with. 

Siefankiewicz, in his third year 
since returning lo coach the 
Mastodons, looks for his team to be 
the surprise of the conference. The 
preseason coaches' poll has placed 
IPFW ninth in the GLVC. but 
Siefankiewicz thinks a belter future 
is in store, 

"I know we're going to surprise 
some people this year." he said. "I 
truly believe that if we're injury 
free, we can surprise some people " 

This team, which may start five 
freshmen, fields a different look 
from last year, focusing more on 
scoring and offense to take advan- 
tage of individual players' talents. 



Last year, Harper scored 20 goals, 
bui nobody else netted more than 
five. Thai should change this year 
with ihc addition of some new 
recruits. 

"It's the strongest offensive 
team [since I've been here)." 
Siefankiewicz said. "We still seem 
to be disorganized defensively - 
we're still ovcrcommitiing a little 
bii" 

Playing alongside Harper at 
sirikcr will be Danny Perez, a junior 
college all-Amcrican from 
Mississippi. The only veteran 
defender is co-captain Bennie 
Trevino. a Bishop Liters graduate. 
Senior co-captain Mall Schmitz 
will reium to goal, and freshmen 
Craig Czubik, Justin Labrum and 
Brandon Combe will form Ihe 
defensive trio led by Trevino 

Newcomer Paul Harvey will be 
farthest up Ihc field in 
Siefankiewicz' system, in which he 
emphasizes player-position flexibil- 
ity. Strikers will often interpose 
wiih midfielders and defenders in 
the course of a match, according to 
Siefankiewicz. 



Ample support will also be 
available on the bench. Freshmen 
Brad Chappcll from Boca Raton. 
Fla and Guy Camera arc cxpecied 
to contribute heavily from the start. 

"Guy has been very impres- 
sive", Siefankiewicz said, "[and] 
Brad Chappcll can throw the ball 40 
yards." 

All of this new talent will be 
showcased at Memorial Stadium on 
Saturday, Sepl. 14. as the 
Mastodons face off with two-time 
Conference America champion 
UAB and Sunday, Sept. 15. when 
they take on another CA power- 
house, Marquette. 

For anyone counting on two 
blowouts next weekend, (he odds 
are for it, hut it behooves one to also 
remember lhal Chaminade College 
beat Ralph Samson-led University 
of Virginia twelve years back and 
came within a minute of downing 
Indiana University just two years

The lime spent in building a 
great sports program is always 
longer than the lime reaping the 
rewards, and die women's volley- 
ball learn is no exception. Coach 
Tun Helfron's Lady Volleydons put 
their skills and his off-season plan- 
ning into action last weekend at the 
North Dakota State University 
Classic in Fargo, N.D 

Unfortunaiely. as any great mili- 
tary general realizes, a first battle 
plan almost never works; it is only a 
basis upon which lo make changes. 

Heffron may institute a few 
adjustments in preparation for the 
coming tournament ai Norfhwood 
University at Midland. Mich. 

Friday, the Volleydons began 
their season with a 15-3, 15-5, 15-6 
win over Winona Si. University of 
Minnesota. 

Bui then the trouble started 
Before the first match, ihe learn 
received a call from the learns doc- 
tors lhal freshman middle hitter 
Laura Lawson would be unable lo 
play. Then a few hours after walking 
over WSU. the Volleydons faced off 
lo Great Lakes Intercollegiate 
Athletic Conference power 
Michigan Tech. 

IPFW followed its season-open- 
ing win with what Heffron called 
ihe worst level of play of ihe tourna- 
ment as the team lost. 15-9, 15-3, 
12-15. 15-6. 

Saturday, redemption was in 
order, so the Volleydons came up 
wiih more impressive play in a 
lough, one-and-a-half hour loss lo 
N. Dakota Stale that showed more 
of a lack of luck lhan anything 

"We played preiiy well, actual- 
ly." Heffron said. "[ButJ we'd side 



oui three times; they'd side oul three 
times; we'd make a mistake and 
they'd score." 

Setter Adrian Raupfer started the 
maich, but as the offense focused on 
the middle. Junior Amy Lubcn 
replaced her and performed 
admirably, according lo Heffron. 

In the final match, against the 
University of Minnesota-Dululh, 
fatigue from the previous three 
matches took its loll as the 
Volleydons suffered a four-game 
heartbreaker lo finish the tourna- 
ment 1-3. The final match com- 
menced just 20 minutes after the 
match against NDSU ended 

Game one came and went with a 
lone Mastodon point as the worn- 
down IPFW side began to show its 
tired side. 

"We just played horrible," 
Heffron said. "We were playing 
back-lo-back [matches]." 

In the second game, Heffron 
replaced the entire lineup from the 
Tirst game, including re-instating 
Raupfer. who had struggled earlier 
in the afternoon, with good enough 
results to win ihe game, 15-12. 

With the same lineup in the third 
game, the Volleydons played even 
with UMD until the ninth point then 
fell apart. 

"We slopped passing and hitting 
ihe ball," Heffron said. "We just 
stopped playing." 

The fourth and final game 
brought more of the same as IPFW 
ran its offense effectively and. at 14- 
10. needed only one sideoul to send 
Ihe match lo game live. Once again, 
the Volleydons losi their poise and 
gave up the next six points to relin- 
quish the game and the match, 15-1. 
12-15, 15-9, 16-14 

The upcoming loumamcni sports 
GLIAC foe Saginaw Valley Stale 



University. Rollins College of 
Florida, as well as host Noribvvood 
Universily, another GLIAC learn, 
this weekend 

While citing Andi Rcichari's per- 
formance as Lawson's replacement 
in ihc middle and right bitter Leslie 
Stamelz' play as pleasant surprises 
during the NDSU tournament, 
Heffron said his learn needs lo 
develop a killer instinct: "We need 
to know how to close Ihe door."
