Where's Notre Dame? 



The last time we checked, the University of 
Noire Dune wu located near South Bend In 
Notre Dime, Ind. 

According to Liu Birnbach, author of 
"Lisa Birnbach* College Book," the 
University of Notre Dime ta located In Fori 
Wayne. Well that'a newi to ua. 

Maybe Bimbach confuted IPFW with Notre 
Dame. After all, IPFW* athletic teama wear 
gold, ai do Notre Damc'i IPFW however. 
hai red to go with It* gold. Notre Dame baa 
blue lo go with Its color. IPFW la located on 
Ihe St Jmeph River. Soulh Bend, home of 
Noire Dame la alio located on the St- Joseph 
River One problem exist* with that theory —

Maybe Bimbach confined the two aa

Maybe that 1* where Bimbach confuaed Ihe 
two collegea — their nlcknamei. IPFW haa a 
cumbersome olekname, the Mastodons. 
Notre Dame haa a simple, eeiy to tay 
nickname, the Irish. 

Another theory might be that Bimbach 
confused Notre Dame with St. Francis 
CoDege. St. Francis, like Notre Dame, la 

Catholic universities. 

Maybe Bimbach doesn't know geography 
and should apend acme time In Fort Wayne. 
Maybe she would learn that Fort Wayne haa 
many Tine restaurants, 1 cam that Fori Wayne 
has three riven, learn that Fori Wayne is 
Indiana's second largest city and learn that It

In the movie, Martin, a lawyer, bos his body Infiltrated by 
Lily Toml in alter she dies. Originally Tomlin's soul was to go 
Inside someone else, but the soul ends up inside of Martin, 
andwegeta treat. 

Martin does a wonderful job portraying a body half con- 
trolled by a woman and half controlled by a man. Walthing 
Martin walX down the street with both halves walking dil- 
fercnlly is funny enough, but the scene where Martin la 
helped by Tomlin's half in the bathroom gave tnt a side 
ache. Martin was able to change his movements easily, and I 
enjoyed his performance. 

Lily Tomlln. on the other hand, didn't seem to fit into her 
role Whenever she became emotional, the emotion was 
lake, and whenever she became serious, the seriousness 
didn't become her. She clashed with Ihe part too much 

Alter Tomlin's soul was Inside of Martin, n Tlbetlan 
meditator tries to transport Ihe soul into the bowl, so that It 
can change places with another soul. Actually, the movie Is 
Funny and as logical as 11 could be. "All of Me" didn't have 
many Flaws, and the supporting cast did a good Job. 

"All of Me " is a good a how and fun to sec.
