Grievances detailed 



Granahan resigns from senate 



Calling the IPFW Student Senate a 
bunch of neo-nazi-type, political sci- 
ence-type, enthusiasts, Terry 
Granahan has resigned as a student 
senator. 

Granahan officially submitted his 
resignation on Thursday, Nov. 19, but 
gave The Communicator a copy the 
day before. The resignation reads: 



"II is with regret that I submit my 
official resignation as a student sen- 
ator. I feel I have more relevant op- 
portunilies with which to spend my 
time than to sit around with a bunch 
of neo-nazi type political science en- 
thusiasts whose biggest thrill in life is 
arguing on Wednesday nights at ihe 
senate meetings, usually about moot 
points that have little or no salience to 
the students of this campus. 

"I feel sorry for the handful of sen- 



ators tsome of which have already 
resigned! thai joined student senate 
for Ihe purpose of which it was de- 
signed; that is, to help in a 
way the students of IPFW. 

"It's a shame that the senate we 
currently have is a hunch of 'yes men' 
led by a joke of a student body presi- 
dent, who can't seem to leave his per- 
sonal life out of the affairs of the 
students here at IPFW." 

In an interview Wednesday. 




Thank you. Jack Ulmer 



Student Senate members Kurt Gregory, president; Indra Matulionis, SAB chair; and Phil Downs, vki 
hand Jack Ulmer a plaque of appreciation for his years of service lo Ihe IPFW student body (pholo 
Delobbe). 



' president; 
by Gabriel 



Granahan refused to name the sen- 
ators he thought were doing a good 
Job. 

When asked if he really thought the 
senate were neo-nazis, Granahan re- 
sponded, "Although that might be ex- 
aggerated, the point I was trying to 
make was that the senators are so 
radical in (heir views and altitudes 
that they just want to argue." 

"The meetings are controlled by the 
president and the vice-president with 
little input from senators." Granahan 
said. 

Granahan dislikes Ihe fact that 
Gregory is now dating a student sen- 
ator, Carol Hildebrand. "It could be 
affecting everyone else's reaction to 
any bill or proposals coming from that 
particular senator," Granahan said. 

In an Interview Monday. Nov. 23. 
Gregory denied his relationship with 
Hildebrand has affected the senate. "I 
don't practice favoritism," Gregory 
said. 

Gregory also defended the senate 
record. "The Senate record can sland 
on its own. We have done miles more 
work than any senate. We are dealing 
with the used booksale, faculty/course 
evaluations, parking and we have 
been vocal on color changes. None of 
these points arc moot," Gregory said. 

Gregory also criticized Granahan 's 
poor attendance record. A check with 
Internal Affairs chair, Barb 
Kucharski. revealed that Granahan 
attended only two meetings and had 
four unexcused absences as a student 
senator. 

"He's pretty observant for only 
showing up for two meetings," said 
Vice President Phil Downs. 



IPFW may see on-campus housing in future 



BY KIM TETER 
Chief Reporter 

Around the year 1990. IPFW could 
possibly expect to see dormitories 
built on campus, with another 
possibility of apartments added by 
1993. 

This is just one of the five recom- 
mendations that are being considered 
and looked at by the Committee on the 
Nature and Quality of the 
Undergraduate Experience at IPFW. 

These recommendations were based 
upon surveys of students and faculty 
and IPFW, comparisons with similar 
institutions, and a review of related 
research. 

Kathy Trier conducted a study en- 
titled "Student Needs Assessment" 
back in March 1987 as a course re- 
quirement of her sociology research 
methods students. The intent was to 
survey the breadth of the student 
population at IPFW to see what the 
students and faculty felt was needed. 



One of the major recommendations 
is that campus housing should be 
provided for residence halls for un- 
dergraduates and apartments for 
families. The availability of residence 
facilities would enable IPFW to at- 
tract undergraduates. IPFW could 
compare favorably with other public 
and stale institutions which offer 
housing. 

The goal is to build a residence hall 
by 1990 for approximately 500 stu- 
dents. The ultimate goal should be to 
accommodate 20% o( the full-time 
enrollment or 1,300 students. 

The second recommendation is that 
since it is necessary to stimulate in- 
volvement of freshman early, a 
freshman orientation program should 
be expanded lo a year-long program 
of structured programs. 

This past July, the orientation was a 
success because of the strong in- 
dication of interest of incoming stu- 
dents and support from the faculty 
and administration. The goal is to 
provide a comprehensive, on-going 



program by 1988. 

Since IPFW is a commuter campus, 
it does not really encourage student/ 
faculty interaction. Two strategies will 
be to have a mentoring program and 
have co-sponsored events with SAB. 
The goal should be for every depart- 
ment chair to develop by the fall of 
1988 at least five programs each 
semester that will provide out-of -class 
experiences. 

Another major consideration is to 
build an Olympic size pool by 1993 in 
order to enhance IPFW's Wellness/ 
Fitness /Intra murals Program. Since 
there is not an Olympic size pool in 
the Fort Wayne area, it would be 
beneficial to IPFW to build one. The 
objective is to offer a comprehensive 
program by the spring of 1988. The 



goal should be to have campus-wide 
support of the facility in order to 
promote health among the members 
of Ihe university community. 

And finally, modifications and addi- 
tions should be considered for the ex- 
ternal environment that would create 
a significant landmark, IPFW suffers 
from an "image" program brought 
about by confusion regarding its 
identity. 

An inviting entrance or a landmark 
edifice would provide symbols for the 
campus. The goal should be for spaces 
to be designed by the fall of 1988 with 
the objective of promoting outdoor 
interaction 

A main entrance should be identified 
and a structure designed by 1990 that 
would become a "symbol" for IPFW.

Election postponed, 
book sale bill passed 



Students' Government has moved the election to determine the school 
colors back a week and Follett's will have competition for next semester's 
used book market. 

The move came on Resolution 8788-11, introduced by Internal Affairs Chair 
Barb Kucharski. The resolution moved the date of the election from Tuesday 
and Wednesday, Dec. 1 and 2, to Tuesday and Wednesday, Dec. 8 and 9. If no 
color combination wins a majority, the run-off will be held on Tuesday and 
Wednesday, Dec. 15 and 16. 

President Kurt Gregory, in his presidential report, said he had been told by 
a staff member of The Communicator that the previous arrangement did not 
give the paper enough time to adequately publicize Ihe event. Nonetheless, 
the move pushes the run-off election to finals week. Vice-President Phil 
Downs said the only alternative was to postpone the balloting until the next 
semester, and that was undesirable. 

The Senate also passed Bill B788-N. The bill, Introduced by an Internal 
Affairs Committee member. Forbes Mcintosh, calls for the Student Senate to 
sponsor a used book sale. The sale itself will be in January, although the 
specific dates weren't available by press time. 

Those wishing lo sell books should include an envelope with their name, 
address, phone number and the name and price of the book being said. Books, 
will be collected~after finals week on dales to'be announced. Sellers may pick 
up their envelopes containing Ihe money from the sale at the Students' 
Government office one week alter the sale has ended. Students' Government 
is in no way responsible for lost or stolen items. 

Lastly, the Senate moved to accept Dave Hollis and Dave Welker as 
student senators. Hollis is a sophomore majoring in political science and 
Welker is a freshman majoring In engineering,

Red and black best bet C 



Color is becoming a hot topic on

However, crimson and gold do nave

Another color combination sug-

colors together are not bad but are

on from Old Dominion would feel at 
home if the colors were blue and 
while. But what color of blue would 
it be? Dark blue 7 Sky blue? Baby 
blue'' Process blue (whatever color 
that might be)? If blue and white 
wins the election, another referen- 
dum will be needed to decide on 
what shade of blue 

Kelly green and navy blue are 
also on the ballot. Kelly green and 
navy blue are too. preppy. People 
in the community will believe that 
all IPFW students are after MBA's 
and BMW's. 

One good color combination is on 
the ballot: red and black. Black 
and red look good together, reflect 
IPFW's parent universities and 
appear almost invincible. 



Wallace comments 
on school colors 
Tulhe Editor: 

In view of the student and 
faculty interest expressed 
in Ihe latest issue of The 
Communicator regarding 
the IPFW colors, I thought 
that your readers would be 
interested in the following 
facts: 

I On Tuesday. Oct 20. 
during a luncheon for stu- 
dent leaders. Including the 
President of Students' 
Government, 1 brought up 
the problem that IPFW was 
using a number of com- 
binations of colors and that 
the Strategic Planning Task 
Force Subcommittee on 
University Relations had 
made a recommendation on 
this subject. L specifically 
asked what the students' 
preference might be and 
how we could resolve the 
Issue. I received no re- 
sponse then or at any later 
date 

■:. On Monday, Oct. 19. 
during a meeting with the 
SpPakernir the Indiana 
University Faculty and the 
Purdue University Faculty, 
I identified the problem as 
stated to the student group 
above. The response was 
that this was not a faculty 

3 On Friday, Nov 6, the 
President of the Students' 
Government announced to 
the Indiana University 
Board of Trustees that 
IPFW hod adopted new 
colors without student 
involvement 

4 On Monday, Nov. 9, a 
member of the Senate ex- 
pressed the sentiment that 
there was significant inter- 
est within the faculty for 
being involved in a decision 
regarding adopting school 



nounced its intention to 
conduct a referendum in- 
volving students, faculty 
and staff to decide between 
two sets of colors 
6 Apparently no school 



colors have ever been offi- 
cially adopted by IPFW 1 
welcome the referendum 
because it will resolve the 
matter, which has been my 
objective from the 
beginning. 

My only concern is that 
the process devised by Stu- 
dents' Government does not 
allow (or participation by 
the alumni or their boards 
nor for the possibility of 
choosing combinations from 
among the traditional In- 
diana University and 
Purdue University colors 



Blue, white make 
best combination 

To the Editor: 

IPFWs Athletic Depart- 
ment strongly supports the 
change ot the university's 
school colors from red and 
old gold to the bright blue 
aqd while A return to this 
campus's original hues 
helps set off-TPFW Athletics 
from both IU and Purdue 

It gives us something thai 
is our own and something 
we can use to promote the 
fact thai we are IPFW and 
not IU at Fori Wayne or 
Purdue at Fort Wayne like 
many people believe We 
are a combination of those 
two universities, but a sep- 
arate part, and il is lime we 
treated ourselves as such. 

Believe it or not, IPFW 



Ihe Indiana and Purdue 
systems, but a separate and 
vital part, We see ourselves 
like the traditional Ameri- 
can family with strong 
mother and father figures 
and a young child, who in 
time grows up lo assume an 
identity of its own The 
child is no less a member of 
the (amity, yet it is often 
known for something other 
than it's mother and father. 
It might even try something 
new— like blue and white 
school colors— as It begins 
lo form its own urban ■ 
identity.

Librarian sets 
record straight 

To the Editor: 

I am writing with regard 
to theiast paragraph of the 
story on IPFW's colors in 
the Nov lit issue of -"Pbe 
Communicator. I wish to 
make clear why I called Old 
Dominion University to ask 
what their school colors 
are, since the reporter did 
not clarify my motivation. 

I made this call as part of 
my job and not for any 
other reason The reference 
department of Helmke Li- 
brary received a phone call 
from a patron who asked 
what the colors of Old 
Dominion are. After I and 
the librarian who originally 
took the call checked vari- 
ous printed sources without 
success. I decided a phone 
call would be the quickest 
and most reliable solution. 

I then called the patron 
and conveyed the answer. I 
don't know how the reporter 
found out about this refer- 
ence transaction, but during 
the course of the "inter- 
view" which he initiated, I 
did tell him why I call Old 
Dominion. I also gave him 
Ihe phone number so that 
he could verify the infor-

lite giv 



Choice of colors 
should be logical 

To ihe Editor: 

When the time arrives to 
vote on IPFW's official 
colors, please cast your 
vote for the new blue and 
white. 

Blue, symbolizing water, 
represents IPFW's river- 
side location and service to 
the city of three rivers. This 
aquatic relationship in- 
spired the use of blue in the 
new logo and the name 
"Current" for the latest 
campus magazine. 
(Symbolism is far more 
important than reality here, 
unless you want sludge 
brown and murky tan for 
school colors.) 

Blue and while were our 
first team colors. Back in 
the late 60's, blue and white 
athletic uniforms were 
chosen for the same reason 
behind many decisions at 
IPFW - they were cheap, 
and that's a tradition. 

Blue and while are still 
cheaper. Few' budgets at 
IPFW can afford the two- 
color print jobs required to 
produce the old red and 
gold, i Of course, black and 
white would be cheaper yet, 
but we do have our pride. &gt; 

Blue and white just plain 
look good together Red and 
gold, like catsup and mus- 
tard, do have their place. 
But what athlete relishes 
running onto the court 
dressed like a hot dog? 

Blue and white are pop- 
ular. Since these colors 
were introduced by the 
IPFW enrollment man- 
agement office in a logo a 
year and a half ago. they 
have been embraced by the 
athletics office, the sub- 
committee on athletics, the 
subcommittee on university 
relations, the commence- 



IPFW greater identity. The 
name of this university 
leaves no doubt about our 
affiliation with IU and PU. 
Why choose redundant 
school colors? Interviews 
with our graduates indicate 
that it's time we told the 
public what we have to 
offer in addition to (not in- 
stead ofi our IU and PU 
name. 

Whether you are swayed 
by symbolism, tradition, 
economy, good looks, pop- 
ularity, image or the simple 
desire' to Yridve on to greater 
things, remember, as Mike 
Downs bas so succinctly put 
it, "Gold is Old, Red is 
Dead," so let's vote for blue 
and white. 



Cost of change 
one consideration 
To the Editor: 

I read with amused in- 
terest the goal of some 
people on campus wanting 
to change the school's 
colors. Before this occurs, 
has anybody calculated the 
"costs" of having the colors 
blue and white? 

IPFW has four street 
signs with the current 
school colors - Red Drive 
and Gold Drive. What will 
be the financial figure to 
replace these signs, print 
new campus maps, and the 
labor to do so? Who will 
carry Ihe burden of these 



Another reason 
to change colors 

To the Editor: 

In the heal and rhetoric of 
Ihe present controversy, 
let's not overtook why we 
have school colors — to 
identify and to promote 
team /school spirit, in the 
past, IPFW has adopted a 



blend of Indiana's and 
Purdue's colors, resulting in 
some confusion as to our 
identity and spirit. ATH- 
LETICALLY we are not, 
and probably never will be, 
a part of either Indiana's or 
Purdue's illustrious athletic 
programs, even though 
SCHOLASTICALLY we de- 
pend upon each of those 
universities for our many 
wonderful degree pro- 
grams. Adoption of sepa- 
rate colors will not affect 
the scholastic endeavors in 
any way. 

When traveling during the 
past several cross country 
seasons, some of our com- 
petition thought we were, 
either Indiana or Purdue, or 
perhaps a junior varsity 
version of one or the Other. 
WE ARE NOT, AND DO 
NOT WANT TO BE, part of 
either Indiana or Purdue's 
athletic programs; and 
growing athletic program 
here at IPFW Why not 
identify ourselves? What 
better way to identify our- 
selves than to have one set 
of colors (not many) and a 
school/team spirit to go 
with the same. The cross 
country team and its 
coaches strongly endorse 
and recommend that the 
student body vote for royal 
blue and silver/white as our 
official colors.

Facts not given

To the Editor: 

In a front-page article in 
the Nov. 19 issue, you note 
that librarian Susan 
Skekloff called Old Domin- 
ion University to determine 
that University's school 
colors. You make it sound 
as though she herself in- 
itiated the search for that' 
information. In Tact, she 
was only answering one of 
many questions that came 
her way that day. 

The person who asked 
that weighty question 
should certainly get credit

a librarian to help find the 
answer. It makes me

Professor stands 
by quoted statement 

To the Editor: 

Much ado has been made 
about my comment that the 
IPFW commencement looks 
like a "cheap funeral" be- 
cause to the heavy use of 
crimson and gold as our 
school colors. I did not in- 
tend, by that remark, to 
demean or detract from the 
considerable effort given by 
Helen Gibbons and Mari- 
anne Messmann of Ac- 
ademic Ceremonies. They 
always manage to do an 
outstanding job under the 
most strenuous of circum- 
stances. I respect their 
professionalism. I apologize 
to them if my quote makes 
it appear otherwise. 

As an academician, I 
consider my attendance at 
the IPFW commencement 
as one of my most im- 
portant activities of the 
school year. I haven't 
missed one since I started 
teaching at IPFW in 1979. 
That attendance record 
gives me the right to criti- 
cize the gaudy school colors 
and lobby for their change. 
I am an alumnus of IU. 
Purdue and IPFW. That 
gives me another vole. 

I stand by my oft-quoted 
comment. We need lo select 
colors for IPFW that rep- 
resent it as a university, not 
as the offspring of two 
"parents." 

I personally favor blue 
and white for the IPFW 
colors. 1 offer the same ra- 
tionale as that great politi- 
cal scientist, M.C. Downs 
once gave. Blue and while 
were, after all, the colors of 
my high school, Fort Wayne 
Central. My colleagues in 



Slippery ramps are 
difficult for some 

To the Editor: 

With the snow and ice 
season upon us, it has be- 
come apparent that some of 
the sidewalks on the cam- 
pus will be slippery and 
dangerous. As a handi- 
capped student, 1 have also 
realized that it will be dif- 
ficult, if not impossible, for 
some students to reach the 
Student Union Building. 

One reason for this is 
that, for someone with an 
artificial leg or brace, it is 
difficult to master slippery 
stairs or ramps, not to 
mention that wheelchairs 
don't come with snow tires 
for such weather. This 
seems slightly insane since 
Disabled Student Services is 
located in thai building. Not 
to mention The Fort, Stu- 
dents' Government, the 
billiard room, etc... 

Considering this is where 
most of the campus social 
activity takes place, I feel 
that something needs to be 
done. I'm sure that there is 
some location near the 
building that can be used 
for handicapped parking 
spaces. If 1 recall, there is 
parking in back of the 
building for university ve- 
hicles. What would be the 
harm in changing one or 
two of these into 
handicapped parking 

Also, I would like to know 
what else needs to be done 
to get the ball rolling on this 
issue.

Depression 



Holidays may lead to increased depression and possibly suicide 



The holiday season is not 
always a cheery season for 
all. Many people do not en- 
joy Ihe holidays and turn to 
suicide as the answer. 

Chris Voors, a counselor 
at Charter Beacon, stated 
that one reason the suicide 



higher during 
December is because of in- 
creased depression, the 
cause of suicide. She also 
"stated that more people are 
suicidal than actually 
commit suicide. 

Young people between the 
ages of 14 to 25 are more 
likely to commit suicide. 
There are 6000 teenage sui- 



cides a year This figure 
has doubled in the past ten 
years and is in the process 
of doubling yet again. 
Teenagers are also more 
likely to commit suicide in 
groups. Four teenagers in 
New Jersey asphyxiated 
themselves on carbon 



suicide. 

Teenagers tend to commit 
suicide impulsively while 
adults plan it out, stated 
Voors Also, the longer a 
suicide is planned the most 
likely it is to succeed. 

Signals that a friend 
might be contemplating 
suicide include: 

• not socializing to the 



extent they once did 

• pulling away from 
friends or family 

- not getting pleasure out 

of activities once enjoyed 

• giving away personal 



Other symptoms might 



-Steppm' Out- 



- a tendency to anger 
easily 

- increased fatigue 

According to Voors, talk- 
ing with a depressed friend 
about suicide wilt not im- 
plant the idea. 

If a friend is suicidal, 
Voors suggests the person 



: have access to pills 
lethal weapons, such as 
knives, etc. Also, a suicidal 
individual should not be left 
alone and should be en- 
couraged to get professional 
help as quickly as possible. 

There are a few ways to 
avoid getting depressed and 
potentially suicidal during 



the holidays. First, get lots 
of rest. Second, schedule 
events with friends, don't be 
alone. Third, watch the 
amount of sugar one eats. 

Voors also suggests that a 
certain custom or ritual be 
practiced during the holiday 
season to promote a sense 
of purpose and permanence

Piazza rebuilds 



Afler finishing ninlh jn 
the Great Lakes Valley 
Conference lasl season 
and compiling a 17-39 re- 
cord over the past two 
years, high expectations 
became unrealistic for the 
19S7-BS boys basketball 
season. Until Andy Piazza 
arrived 

Piazza, who had a long 
history of roundball suc- 
cess, hopes to install revi- 
talized confidence in the 
Mastodon's program. 

"This is the ultimate 
challenge There's no- 
where to go but up." 
commented the coach on 
the rebuilding process. 

Rebuilding is something 
with which Piazza is fa- 
miliar. In his early coach- 
ing days, he developed 
Hemlock High School, lo- 
cated in Saginaw, Mich- 
igan, into a winning pro- 
gram. Hemlock went 48-16 
during Piazza's last three 
years as coach after going 
20-»5 in his first three. 

In 1984, he became head 
coach at Delta Community 
College in Saginaw. Last 
season he led them to a 24- 
11 mark, a school record 
for victories. 

Before making the 
switch from the backboard 
to the clipboard. Piazza 
impressed many as a 
player. In 1977 he was in- 
vited to tryout for the 
NBA's San Antonio Spurs 

"1 knew I didn't have 
the talent to play on the 
pro level," he said. 

He did, however, have 
the talent to play jn the 
European circuit. Playing 
in Iceland, he led his team 



to the national champion- 
ship as player-coach and 
won Icelandic coach of Ihe 
year honors. 

•'Playing in Europe was 
the greatest thrill of my 
playing career." he said 

It was then however that 
he decided coaching was 
his future "1 realized it 
was time to pack away my 
dreams and start a 

With his playing days 
behind him and a variety 
of coaching success al 
different levels, Piazza is 
prepared for the challenge 
at IPFW. He brings with 
him a fast tempo style 
that brought his previous 
teams many victories. 

"We play a full-court 
press for 40 minutes and 
use all ten players. We 
also look for the high per- 
centage shot," he ex- 
plained, "It's the same 
system I used at Delta " 

Due to Piazza's quick 
pace style, he looks for the 
smaller, more agile player 
when recruiting. Seven- 
fool dunk artists do not 
interest him 

When recruiting, Piazza 
embarks on three main 
areas. "I see if they are 
good student athletes, 
what kind of person they 
are and if they have 
enough skills to make it," 
he said. 

Knowing what it lakes to 
win, Piazza hopes to give 
the Mastodons an attitude 
that will make them more 
competitive this season 

I want them to be op- 
timistic, disciplined, have 
mental toughness, and 
most important, 

patience." 



Dons 3-0 



Don't look now, hut the 
IPFW men's basketball 
team is undefeated, have 

won all three of their games 
by an average margin of 
almost 19 points, and have 
broken the century mark in 
one game. 
After posting a nine and 
i record lasl season, 



the Mastodoi 



started 



things off on the right foot 
this year, winning the 
Grand Valley State 
Tourney. The Dons racked 
up a 95 to 84 win over host 
Grand Valley Six Mas- 
todons were in double fig- 
ures, led by tourney MVP 
Bruce Roland's 28. 

In the title game, the 
Dons defeated Lake Super- 
ior 84 to 69. IPFW put the 
Lake Superior team away 
in the second half after 
leading 38 to 35 at half-time. 

Junior Steve Bard was 
the top scorer for the Dons 
with is points. Jordan, a 
sophomore guard, set a 
single game record for 
steals with eight. That 
broke a mark that had 
stood since the 1979-80 
season 

In the home opener, the 
Dons blasted Northwood 
Institute 44 to 28 in the first 
half and coasted home to a 




Female Dons have slow start 



105 to 75 win. 

Jordan broke another re- 
cord in the game, this time 
his own, as he totaled IS 
assists. Jordan had set the 
old mark of 11 and had tied 
it twice. Roland and Bard 
tied for scoring honors with 
20 points each. 

Coach Andy Piazza's 
team returns to the road, 
traveling io Big Rapids, 
Michigan, tonight to take on

Sports Editor 
The IPFW women's bas- 
ketball team's season is off 
to a slow start after the 
first four games of the year. 
The Lady Dons split two 
games in a tourney hosted 
by Oakland University in 
Rochester. Michigan, and 
then dropped their home 
opener to Grand Valley 
State. A trip across town 
resulted in a loss to Indiana 
Tech. 

Tri-State supplied the 
opposition in the first round 
of the Oakland tour- way 
tourney. The Lady Trojans 
downed the Dons 84 to 76 in 
overtime, Friday. Nov. 20. 
IPFW led at halftime 36 to 
'33. It was all Tri-State in 
overtime as they outscored 
the Dons 13 to 5. 

Robin Scott and Sarah 
Turner lopped the Lady 
Dons with 26 and 24 points 
respectively. 



The Lady Dons broke into 
the win column the follow- 
ing evening with a 61 to 53 
win over Siena Heights in 
the tourney's consolation 
game. Tecna Merrell con- 
nected on ten shots from the 
field to lead the Dons with 
20 points. 

The home opener for the 
Lady Dons didn't look too 
bad at halftime with IPFW 
only trailing Grand Valley 
Slate 23 to 19. But a hot- 
shooting Valley team came 
out of the half-time locker 
room and scored 51 points 
while holding the Dons to 
only 14. 

Valley had only hit on 
eight of 24 shots (33%) in 
the first half but blistered 
the nets at a 59% pace in 
the second 20 minutes. 
IPFW shot 30% in Uie first 
half 18-23) and 21% in the 



second (7-32). 

Merrell again led the 
Dons in scoring with 12 

Saturday the Dons faced 
one of the state's small 
school powerhouses, In- 
diana Tech. Tech took the 
Dons 94 to 77. With 17 
points, Merrell led four 
Mastodons who were in 
double figures. 

The Lady Dons play host 
to the Pepsi Invitational 
this weekend at the athletic 
center. The first game Is 
Friday. Dec 4, at 6 p.m. 
between Lake Superior 
State and Hampton In- 
stitute At 8 p.m. IPFW 
meets Northwood Institute. 
The consolation game will 
start at 6 p.m. Saturday, 
Dec. 5, followed by the 
championship game, at 8
