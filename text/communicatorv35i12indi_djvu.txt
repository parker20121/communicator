Homecoming an "expected"

series "Survivor," who will add

and creativity into the effort to 
keep their illiteracy as a secret," 

In the time when his grcat- 
great-grandparents lived, the 
idea of teaching a slave to read 
and write was thought lo be 
dangerous, Jones explained. 

He reminisced about how 
he thinks of them from lime to 
time, wondering what it must 
have been like for Brice to real- 
ize that through literacy he had 
found "the real key to unlock* 
ing the chains of his slavery." 

The value of literacy was 
passed down to Jones by his 
grandparents, particularly his 
grandfather John Henry, who 
raised him. He described Henry 
as his hero because he made 
sure he received an education 
and helped him to "discover the

dozens of films, plays, televi-

ranged from a bit part in "Dr. 
Strangclove" to "A Family 
Thing" to a reoccurring role in 



Hunt For Red October," 
"Patriot Games," and "Clear 
and Present Danger." 

Currently, he is filming a 
sequel to "The Sandlot" due 
next year, and his voice can be 
heard in "The SpongeBob

Also next year, his voice

known as that of Darth Vader in 
the Star Wars movies, will once 
again give voice to the charac-

is, yes we do but not as often. 
For one, more hair keeps your 
legs warm (sexy thought, isn't 
it?) and two, as soon as you get 
cold after you shave, your legs 
arc all prickly again so it's 
almost not worth shaving in ihe 
first place, especially because 
shaving your legs is a pain in 
the butt. If I'm going to go 
dirough all that hassle, it better 
stay smooth for more than five 

So yes, we shave, but I'd

Halo 2 was released Nov. 9 as the most anticipated video game in history, with 
1.5 million presold. It costs is $49.99 and is rated Mature. 

"It was fighting nobly alongside my brother, dying hundreds of deaths, 
killing thousands of Covenant ... and getting that wartime brotherhood 
without the actual pain, suffering, and mortality that comes with war. " 

Halo 2' a video game 
for brothers-in-arms 



By David C. Hunter 

I In.' (. ommunicator 



I don't actually own a 
copy of the original Halo. I only 
purchased an X-Box two 

Why, then, was I standing 
amongst 30 or 40 other people 
at midnight Tuesday moming 
waiting eagerly to get my hands 
on a copy of Halo 2? 

I stood amongst the most- 
ly male, mostly white and most- 
ly younger crowd, listening to 
them talk excitedly, make jokes, 
and calmly await the game's 
release. Halo experts took turns 
shooting each other on the big 
screen multiplayer set-up 
McVan's had placed perhaps to 
stay boredom and keep people 
occupied. 

There were fathers and 
mothers (only a few, mind you) 
who'd been somehow duped 
into bringing their kid to the 
late, late opening; you could tell 
them apart from adult gamers 
by the way their eyes were 
NOT glued to the Halo screen. 
And finally there were lone 
gunmen, mostly just watching 
and waiting, some occasionally 
yelling out "watch your back!" 
to one of the players as another 
player pointed a rocket launch- 
er and performed ridiculous 
overkill. 

So where did I fit in? I felt 
like a B-list celebrity amongst 
the cast of Ocean's II, an 
ensign amongst Kirk, Spock, 
and McCoy - I felt like a Grunt 
amongst Elites (if you've 
played the game, you'll get it). 

Well, maybe I wasn't 
THAT useless. I've played the 
game on and off for the past 
few years, usually when 1 went 
home to my parents. 

My brother and I would 
play co-op (cooperative play) 
through his favorite levels, and 
occasionally we would death- 
match. Once I even bon-owed 
his X-Box for a month, but I 
never played enough to beat the 

So. then, why did I buy an 
X-Box solely for the purpose of 
owning Halo 2? I was thinking 
about this just before midnight, 
while I waited for the release. 

Maybe, to explain, I 
should tell you more about my 
brother. 

My brother is amongst the 
Halo elile-around these pans, 
anyway. He is a true Master 
Chief, having beaten the game 
on Legendary a few 



without help, and having 
become a force to reckon with 
in the death-match arena. You 
wouldn't know it from talking 
to him he's not boastful, not a 
bear to play with, and he actual- 
ly has a full life outside gaming 
I love to hear tales of his 
exploits at LAN parties, where 
up lo 16 players hook four X- 
Boxes together and spend hours 
killing each other in the most 
inventive, funny and' intense 

My brother is also a chari- 
table person. Those days I 

would play together - I was 
never any real help. 1 didn't 
have the time, the hardware, or 
the talent to make a real differ- 
ence in the games wc played. 

Thinking back, it musl've 
been rather erratic to light 
alongside me in a game of 
Halo, as I'm not very coordinat- 
ed. Sometimes I would sit back 
and let my brother take the 
brunt of the enemies, while I 
found a sniper rifle and a quiet 
spot and look potshots at ran- 

It's the laziest way to 
game-fhe sniper rifle. You can 
be very good at it but still not 
accomplish a whole lot. I would 
often fool myself into thinking 
that while my brother was deal- 
ing most of the punishment, I 
held back to pick off the ones 
he missed, or get the distant 
trouble-makers he couldn't 
reach with an assault rifle or 
melee attack. That wasn't really 
the case, though, and often all I 
accomplished was providing a 
safe place for him to re-spawn 
when a Covenant soldier got 

Other times I would 
"grow a pair." and foolishly 
charge into baltle, yelling some 
fearful phrase to my opponents 
until 1 was virtually clothes- 
lined and had lo wail until my 
brother finished killing every- 
thing to be able to re-spawn. 

However, despite my 
heroic shortcomings, 1 did have 
a hell of a lot of fun. 

Growing up, games were 
mostly one-player, and the ones 
that were Iwo-player were often 
adversarial. Aside from a few 
instances with a friend and ihe 
original Doom, Halo was Ihe 
first game I played cooperative- 
ly wilh anyone. 

My brother would do his 
best to issue commands or sug- 
gestions, and I tried lo follow 
ihem. I would go fetch a vehi- 
cle, lake ihe other side of a 



and let my brother lake Ihe 
grenades and ammo he needed 
lo really blow shil up. It was 
all-exhilarating. fighting 

together, taking on impossible 



degree, what it fell like to be a 
soldier in an army of brother- 
hood. The feeling you get from 
sniping an Elite in the head 
from 50 yards while you watch 
your brother plant a grenade 



I realized why I loved 
Halo so much, and why I was 
scrambling to get a copy of its 
sequel. Il wasn't the action 
packed gameplay-usually 
inventive, frequently intense, 
and a foot-stomping blast. It 
wasn't ihe visuals-large and full 
environments, colorful and 
interesting aliens, and struc- 
tures designed to look at as well 
as blow up. It also wasn'l the 
vehicles, fun by both flight and 
ground. No, it wasn't the 
groundbreaking game that kept 
me fighting for over three 

It was fighting nobly 
alongside my brother, dying 
hundreds of deaths, killing 
thousands of Covenant (okay, I 
probably only killed around... 
30 or so), and getting that 
wartime brotherhood without 
the actual pain, suffering, and 
mortality that cornes with war. 

actual galactic war, I probably 
would' ve moved to planet 
Canada. 

For those interested, Halo 
2 came oui last Tuesday. 

You play as Master Chief, 
a Spartan cyborg wilh enhanced 
abilities and legendary status. 

You fight the Covenant, a 
religious sect of aliens who, for 
some reason or another, are 
benl on the destruction of the 
humankind. 

You fight on space sta- 
tions. Earth and alien planets, in 
many rich and open environ- 
ments, along wilh intense corri- 

Halo 2 is an interactive 
action film with challenges and 
feals to rival even a Vin Diesel 
or Bruce Willis movie. 

If you have an X-Box and 
an even passing interest in gam- 
ing, go buy it. 

Or if you just want to 
bond wilh a brother or friend.

The Communicator 

All right fellow students 
and alumni. I'm going to go out 
on a limb and say it. I'm excit- 
ed for this year's IPFW men's 
basketball season. 

Yeah, lhat's right. [ said it. 
While one of the reasons is 
because the good ol' Memorial 
Coliseum allows us over 21- 
year olds to buy and consume 
alcohol while 10 feet away 
from the opposing team's 
bench, the main reason is, I'm 
falling in love with Mastodon 
basketball.

The 2004-05 squad has 
the potential to be "the team" 
that clinches a conference affil- 
iation for IPFW. As much as I 
hate to say it, the Horizon 
League or the Mid-American 
conference is not going to make 
IPFW a member of their league 









It i 



this season neared its begin- 
ning. 1 began to find myself 
more and more interested in the 
prospects of IPFW. Don't get 
me wrong, I will always be a 
lifelong Hoosier fan and 
Purdont hater, but could there 
perhaps be room for two 
favorite college basketball 
teams?Please say there is. 

In my opinion, this IPFW 
team is capable of winning 
eight to 10 games. Due to not 
being affiliated with a confer- 
ence I believe that our schedule 
will always be our demise, but 



make us a member based on 
revenue-making sports, and the

football is basketball. If the

He grabbed nine offensive

IPFW's two exhibition games. 
Butler averaged nearly seven

Butler's scoring numbers

Noll said the team "has a total-

ering from a torn anterior cruci- 
ate ligament he suffered in his 
right knee at the NBA Prospects 
Camp in June. Simon has par-

has not been cleared for contact. 
However, a Nov. 16 doctor visit

"His surgeon is going 
to look at him (Simon) and dic-

Campbell' (no relation) and 
freshman Jason Malone 
(Bryon's brother) will all con- 
tribute significant playing time. 
The former Campbell will 
give the Mastodons a consistent 
outside shooting threat. 

"The reason I'm here 
is because I can shoot the ball." 
Campbell said. "But there are 
other things I can help out on 
too. like rebounding and help 
defense." 

At 6-foot-IO and just 
200 pounds, the latter Campbell 
is a long 'and fairly athletic big 
man. He runs up and down the 
court well and is a good leaper. 
He will be looked upon to fill 
some of Simon's minutes at the 
center position. 

Noll believes the 
younger Malone may be the 
freshman that steps up and 
gives major contribution to the 
team. Malone scored 22 points

Nineiy-four feel for 40

2004-2005 iPFW women's bas- 
ketball team. The squad is 
sporting a new look, with more 
depth, speed, and scoring this 

Their system, accord- 
ing to junior guard Jenny 
Green, is fast, fas! and fast. 

"It's a philosophy that 
D II and D III teams use. We're 
supposedly the only D-I team 
trying it. It's the Grinnell 
System. The goal is to shoot as 
many threes as possible, get the 
other team running up and 
down the floor to tire them out, 
and play as many people as pos- 
sible," Green said. 

Her career highlights 
include 12 points against UTPA 
and nine rebounds against 
Wright Slate last season. Green 
also came into this season sec- 
ond in average rebounds this 
year with 4.1 per game. 

This philosophy, in its 
first test, succeeded when the 
Mastodons scored 104 points in 
their exhibition against Marion 
College last week.
