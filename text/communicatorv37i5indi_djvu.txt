Kigali. Paris and London. 

Among those in attendance in Fort 
Wayne were numerous politicians in- 
cluding Congressman Mark Souder 
and Democratic candidate for State 
Representative, Phil GiaQuinla. 

Representatives from various reli- 
gious denominations around the Fort 
Wayne area made speeches while sup- 
porters waved flags that said things 
like, "Never Again?" or "Genocide 
Must Stop Now!" 

Protesters of the genocide passed 
by the engraving etched on the side of 
the courthouse that reads, "The peo- 
ples' government, made for the people, 
made by the people, and answerable lo 
the people." The rally was a request 
for the government to stand in agree- 
ment of this proclamation. 

With a strong wind blowing, one 
speaker after another thanked the Unit- 
ed States for what it has done while 
urging for the country lo continue in its 

- Suliman Giddo, the President of 

the Darfur Peace and Development Or- 
ganization, implored the crowd, "We 
need you to act. If we don't act today 
and slop this genocide, it will become 
a habit." 

Giddo's father currently resides in 
Khartoum and his aunt in a refugee 
camp in Chad. 

deteriorating and that while talking 
with his family in the Darfur region, 
little is spoken about the genocide due 
to the horror of what is taking place. 

In February 2003. governmental 
violence erupted in the western part 
of Sudan resulting in the displace- 
ment of over two million Sudanese 
and a death toll ranging from 200,000 
to oyer 400,000. According to recent 
estimates, nearly S5 percent of the dis-

The United States government de- 
clared the slaughter lo be genocide in 
2004. 

Since then, America has 
given money to humanitarian 
aid groups, as well as the Afri- 
can Union, which is set lo pull 
out of Sudan ai the end of the 
month. 

Despite the passing of a 
resolution in the UN calling 
for peacekeeping troops lo be 
deployed to the Darfur region, 
civilians are slill being targeted 
by the Sudanese government. 
Sudan's government is cur- 
rently refusing enlry of these 
peacekeeping troops. 

Members of the IPFW com- 
munity were among ihe partici- 
pants in the rally. Ken Christ- 
mon, director of Multicultural 
Affairs at IPFW, passionately 
addressed the crowd, saying, 
"One life killed is one life loo 
many." He later added, "No 
more genocide - Life!" The 
crowd answered him back

Internet Cite' Recognizes Professor 




Professor William E. Cooper was 
recently contacted by Thomson Sci- 
entific's ISIHighlyCited.com and was 
informed that his work would soon be 
added to their web site. 

Cooper has been a professor for 
thirty years, and has spent the past fif- 
teen years at IPFW after receiving his 
tenure in 1991. 

Not just any professor can be added 
to ISlHighlyCited.com. The web site is 
reserved for the best of the best in their 
field. 

The web site contains over 5,000 
research profiles in 21 categories; Coo- 
per's work will be in the Plant and Ani- 
mal Sciences category. 

Cooper says he was not very famil- 
iar with the web site prior to being in- 
formed of his work's acceptance. 

"I had heard of it, but never been to 
it myself. I know many of the people 



ceived the news thai his work would 
be added to the web sile. 

"It was a real eye-opener that made 
me feci that m&gt; work was having some 
impact, that I was making a contribu- 
tion. It's nice to know that others not 
only read the papers, but used them in

Dreams Lead 

Bilingual 

Storyteller 



"Compare yourself lo yourself; 
there is nothing more powerful than 
lo have a dream and achieve it," said 
Gregorio Pedroza, a bilingual story- 
teller u ho spoke about achieving your 
dreams at a Hispanic Heritage Month 
event in the Walb Student Union last 
Wednesday. 

The event was held by Hispanos 
Unidos and revolved around the idea 
of achieving your dreams. 

Pedroza travels around the world 
speaking about his life, while selling 
books and compact discs. All pro- 
ceeds go towards a scholarship bene- 
fiting a student who wouldn't be able 
to attend college otherwise. 

"I love to be part of people's 
dreams. I was given ,i second chance, 
so why shouldn't 1 give it to others 
loo?" Pedroza said. 

Pedroza began by speaking about 
his racial background.

"There's Spanish blood in me. 
I know there's French blood in me. 
There's a lot of different kinds of blood 
i nme because my ancestors couldn't 
run very fast and they just loved ev- 
erybody. So here I am: Mexican, with 
curly hair and not so dark skin. 
But that's who I am and that's what I'm 
going to bung lorward to the world," 
Pcdroza said. 

When Pedro/a was young, his fam- 
ily decided to send him to school. He 
was the school's only Spanish-speak- 
ing student and learned to speak Eng- 
lish in the fifth grade One day, Pcdro- 
za \s teacher asked him to stand up in 
the front of the classroom. 

"She said 'everybody take a look 
at Pedroza, because that's what fail- 
ure looks like. If you want to amount 
to nothing, that's what you got to do'," 
Pedro/, i said He then went on to ex- 
plain that this was tin "the lough love" 
he needed in order lo decide lo go to 

Pedroza earned his doctorate in 
chemistry from West Virginia Univer- 
sity in 1967. 

"Just because I didn't have shoes lo 
go to school, |iist because I spoke Span- 
ish, |ust because my parents were very 
poor and didn't speak English doesn't 



mean that 1 couldn't dream. Thai taught 
me not lo look at what I don'I have, but 
[to] look at what 1 do have and make 
the most of it," Pedroza said. 

According to Pedroza, there are 
three steps lo achieving a dream: gel- 
ling a dream and owning il, talking 
to people who are already doing your 
dream, and mosi importantly, telling 
everybody about your dream. 

Pedroza worked for the Pentagon 
and IBM until doctors discovered a

Lecturer Tells of Literature's Impact on Humanity 



By Allison Graber 
Chief Reporter 



Azar Nafisi, author of Reading Lo- 
lila in Tehran: A Memoir in Books, was 

recently the guest lecturer for the 1PFW 
Omnibus Lecture Scries. The event 
took place in Walb Student Union Ball- 
room on Sept. 13. 

With a standing room only crowd 
and lire code violations imminent, or- 
ganizers were forced to open up seals 
in ihe overflow rooms lo hold the eager 
attendees. Chatter filled the air until 
dimmed lights cued the silence. 

Once introduced, Nafisi confidently 
strolled up )o the podium and look the 
audience on a joume\ into literature 
and its impact on humanity. She joked 
aboul how the American culture goes 
to the Dixie Chicks for news and urged 
Americans to look past the superficial 
information to the works that reflect the 
heart of humankind. 

"Each generalion should see their 
time as an urgent lime." Nafisi said as 









Hurricane K.itnn.i and the genocide in 

She also used quotes from authors 
such as Vladimir Nabokov and books 



like Jane Austen's Pride 

Nafisi joked, "I 
don'l mind dreaming 
aboul Mr. Darcy every 
month or so." 

While using humor 
ai times to convey her 
message, most of the 
discourse was based on 
her relationship with 
literature and its freeing 
nature. She explained 
that in order lo under- 
stand others you need 
imagination. 

According to Nafisi. 
'Imagination gives you 
an alternative view of 
other cultures." 

Nafisi used her own 
experiences during the 
Iranian Revolution to 
express how freedom 
is a necessity in every 
part of the world. She 
remarked that resisting 
atrophy ot feeling is a 
battle and that is why 
we, as human beings, 
need books.

Writing Job Gives Untrained Student Stress 



By Tiffany Dirig 



How many of you have ever f 
like an imbecile at work? I'm i 
talking about "oh-rats-I-walked-in 
a-glass-door" sort of stupid. I'm ta 
ing about the full-fledged euns-bl, 
ing, class-A moron type of feeling. 

If" you've never felt that way, 
I'm utterly green with envy. I say 
(hi' inaml&gt; because, for the last three 
weeks or so, every day 1 go to work 
is like a testament to my idiocy and 
shockingly deplorable incompetence. 



The &gt; 



of I 



be 



summed up by four little words: I am 
drastically under-qualified. When I 
applied lor my office job, 1 was more 
than confident as die position was for 
a "technical writer". 

Duh, I write all the time. This job 
should've been a cakewalk. I have 
never been more wrong about some- 



thing in my entire life. During the in- 
terview. I was told that I'd be in charge 
-of something called the Sarbanes-Ox- 
ley (SOX) audit. 

I was also told that my supervisor 
would walk me through it. A whole lot 
of good that's done me. 

Apparently, this SOX stuff's pretty 
intense. Don't get me wrong. I didn't 
walk into this job totally blind. But, I 
didn't walk into it totally cognizant ei- 
ther. 

I figured that I'd be asked to gather 
up some papers, the rest of the time I'd 
be tasked with drafting training manu- 
als and other informational text. Let 
me be the first to tell you that I haven't 
written anything in the last six months. 

I have, however, managed to ac- 
crue more intense migraines, an im- 
measurable loss of sleep, and an in- 
credibly nervous stomach. 

This is the most stressful job I've 
ever had. primarily because I wasn't 



trained ai all. Not a single 



a of ll 






first started this job. I went to shadow 
my counterpart at another plant, but I 
didn't comprehend a word she said. 

Any of you remember a little fi- 
asco that took place about five years 
ago involving a tiny company sailed 
Enron? Well, SOX was created in order 
to keep something like thai from hap- 
pening again. 

Basically, if a company fails their 
audit enough times, (he big-wigs are 
dragged in front of a panel of judges 
and forced to plea their cases. If they 
bomb that, it's off to the big house. 

Yeah, if a company doesn't com- 
ply with SOX. people go to jail. Others 
lose their jobs. And by "others", I am 
referring lo the poor saps in my posi- 

It is said that hindsight is 20/20, 
and I'm beginning to believe that. You 
see, had I known that I was going to 



be required to subject myself to daily 
looks of disappointment, derision, and 
overall haired, perhaps I would've cho- 
sen another profession. But. in my de- 
fense, 1 didn't even know what 1 didn't 

The ill-will that is obviously har- 
bored toward me in my office, however, 
isnol whal makes it insanely difficult to 
leave bed. 

It's the ruling ideology that I'm 
a slacker (nevermind that I'm writing 
this at work) and a doll. My boss' boss' 
boss— and all my bosses in between — 
seem to believe that nothing I'm told 
can travel the vast distance from their 
mouths to my brain. 

And I honestly think they've given 
up any hope of me being able to pro- 
cess said information. 

To tell you the truth, it really 
peeves me. I mean, I work two jobs 
to support myself. I go to school. I 



nincompoop thai is to be looked down 
upon: I'm a smart girl. I can hear, lis- 
ten, and compute most directions thai 
come from my boss' mouth. 

If, by some chance, I don't under- 
stand whal they're talking about, I'm a 
big enough girl to ask questions. My 
problem lies in that my bosses can'l 
seem lo agree with how they want me 
to run this stupid audit. 

Everyday brings a new set of 
guidelines; a new set of "dos" and 
"don't dos". Sometimes, I truly feel 
that I'm the only one that has to en- 
dure such debilitating mind games in 
the workplace. Am 1 really? Because 
if I am, I'm going to quit my job now, 
crawl into a hole, and sob in the fetal 
position. 

If I'm not, I'm going to lead a re- 
voli against bosses that treat their em- 
ployees like thick-skulled dunces! This

Waiting Until Marriage Still Popular 



ByTarra Kohli 
Cavalier Daily 
(U-Wire) 



Marnage. and all that it encompasses. 



In today's mainstream society, 
especially with college students, ihe 
controversy surrounding premarital 
sex appears lo has all hut fizzled. A 
recent study from ihe Princeton Reli- 
gion Research Center showed that 46 
percent of 18- lo 21-year-olds believe 
premarital sex is wrong. 

While some students around 
Grounds may hear of hook-ups "go- 
ing all ihe way." one must re-exam- 
ine why there are such divergent be- 
liefs on premarital sex: Why do some 
choose to wail until marriage while 
others don'l? 

One of the main concerns of en- 
gaging in premarital sex is the po- 
icntial negative consequences, such 
as sexually transmitted diseases and 
pregnancy. 

Monogamy decreases the chances 
of spreading and acquiring sexually 
uaiisinitted diseases. 

Fourth-year College student Can- 
dice Ng said she believes "there is 
a certain degree or risk concerning 
health issues in premarital sex and h 



Czamik cited Genesis 2:24, which 
reads. "For this reason a man will leave 
his father and mother and be united to 
his wife, and they will become one 
flesh." 

Czamik also believes in waiting 
uniil marriage "because ol the nature of 
sex - two people physically and emo- 
tionally tied to one another because of 
such an intimate experience that it is 
made to be a permanent bond." 

For her, Czarnik said, sex should 
meet nol onlyphysicai, but even more 
importantly, deep emotional need for 
truly knowing and loving someone 
while being known and loved our- 



"if ;

However, she also said she be- 
lieves ihere are precautions one can 
take thai make premarital sex safer - 
- mainly the use of condoms. 

She said she feels that the legally 
sanctilied relationship of marriage 
helps to prepare one for ihe repercus- 
sions of unprotected sex. 

Others, still, choose to abstain for 
religious purposes. 

"Sex is a good thing, within its de- 
signed context and purpose --one man 
committed to one woman," ihird-year 
Nursing studenl Laura C/arnik said. 



mate their love for each other. 

Czamik said she believes some 
people do not wait solely for religious 
reasons, but because "that is what they 
have always been lold is right, and oth- 
ers just for personal choice because 
they want sex to be special." 

However, there are a number of 
reasons why many do not many wail 
for marriage. Some would argue that it 
does not lake a marriage to make sex 
special. 

Fourth-year College siudeni Mil .c 
Blackrnore is one such individual. He 
said he did nol wait until marriage be- 
cause he fell in love. 

For him religious guidelines on 

"It had more to do with passion 
and intensity than wilh religion and 
any archaic guidelines on sexual be- 



marital sex is a beautiful thing that you 
shouldn't feel guilty about," he said. 
"But ai the same time, it's important 
to think about any emotional reper- 
cussions. With physical intimacy, it's 
difficult to avoid some sort of emo- 
tional consequences. When you love 
someone, sex transcends the physical 
intercourse and is about Ihe emotional 
inlimacy." 

Blackrnore said he does not be- 
lieve in having sex unless he is in love, 
but he also thinks that he does not rep- 
resent the average Universily student. 

One issue surrounding premarital 
sex is the lack of communication be- . 
(ween this generation and their parents 
regarding beliefs and opinions on sexu- 

f /.annl. eluded U&gt; ihi\ miiceni -as ■ 
ing she suspects some people abstain 
because "that is what thy have always 
been told is right." 

Blackrnore said he felt part of (he 
problem is the way people discuss sex 
wiih their parents. 

"With our generation, most parents 
are miserably uncomfortable address- 
ing Ihe topic," Blackrnore said. "They 
avoid open discussion. The worst sex 
talk is to just say to wait until marriage 
and not explain why They lack the sen- 
sitivity and patience lor such a talk." 

While opinions on premarital sex 
vary today, the students interviewed 
seemed to agree: Whether or not one 
chooses lo wait, they are, inadvertently 
or not, reconciling their behavior with 
their moral and religious behels regard- 
ing sexuality.

'Dahlia' 
Too Rich 
to Stomach 



By Samuel McKewon 
Daily Nebraskan 
Courtesy of U- Wire 



"The Black Dahlia" is a disaster of 
campy melodrama and grim exploita- 
tion -- a collision of competing genres, 
performances and moods, all fueled by 
director Brian DePalma's goofy pec- 
cadilloes and obsessions. It's like huff- 
ing angel dust while unmanned blimps 
crash into Lake Huron. Just wait until 
the scene at the lesbian cabaret. 

DePalma ("Scarface," "The Un- 
touchables") and screenwriter Josh 
Friedman ("War Of The Worlds") 
adapted the James Ellroy novel that es- 
tablished him as this generation's Ray- 
mond Chandler. Ellroy retold the 1947 
Los Angeles murder of Elizabeth Ann 
Short, an aspiring actress cut in half and 
disemboweled, a clown's smile carved 
in her mouth. The papers named Short 
'"Black Dahlia" for her habit of walk- 
ing up and down Sunset Boulevard in 
mourning clothes. The case remains 
unsolved. 

The book and movie "close" the 
case through the work of two detec- 
tives: The controlled Bucky (Josh 
Hartnett), and the more volatile Lee 
(Aaron Eckhart). both ex-boxers of av- 
erage investigative skills (and poorer 
ethics) who more or less stumble into 
a bizarre conspiracy beyond their pay 
grade. They also share a strange, most- 
ly platonic relationship with Kay Lake 
(Scarlett Johannson), who cooks them 
big dinners, uses a cigarette holder and 
has the letters of a gangster carved into 
her back. 

Where do we start with this de- 
ranged cinematic morsel? Let's begin 
with how the casting stinks. Eckhart is 
too manic as the terse Lee, while Hart- 
nett is his usual study in confusion. And 
Ms. Johannson? Crash. Bum. Cringe. 

At 21, she's far too young — Kim 
Basinger was 43 in her Oscar- winning 
role in the adaptation of Ellroy 's "L. A. 
Confidential" -- and too tongue-tied 
for the rat-a-tat dialogue of film noirs. 
Worst, she is saddled with DePalma's 
habit of casting blond women as sex 
idols, like when Johannson straddles 
the toilet in an open nightgown, word- 
lessly challenging Bucky to bolt up the 
stairs and take her. He shakes his head, 
and she slams the door, her loins de- 
It gets steamier! DePalma's take 
on post-war lesbianism is a raucous pi- 
ano bar of kissing-girl chorus lines and 
k.d. lang crooning 'Time For Love." 
The camera swoops about as Bucky 
casually asks if anybody knew the dis- 
emboweled woman. 

Into this absurdity walks Madeline 
Linscott (Hilary Swank), a socialite 
who bills herself as a Dahlia look-a- 
like. Bucky sure thinks so. 

The last half of the movie dawns 
with the introduction of Madeline and 
her family. They know where the bod- 
ies are buried and who put them there. 

"The Black Dahlia" is probably at 
its craziest, and maybe its best, in these 
scenes. The Linscott clan unravels while 
Madeline tries to balance her repulsion 
with psychotic loyalty. Swank doesn't 
resemble the real Dahlia, or Mia Kir- 
shner, who plays her in the movie. But 
with the [Catherine Hepburn accent and 
theatrical eyes, she seems to be the only 
lead actress in on DePalma's joke. 

The final act is faithful to Ellroy s 
novel, but it seems far more ridiculous 
here because of the movie's already 
scattershot plot and endlessly shifting 

There's so much insipid, unbridled 
passion between Bucky, Kay and Mad- 
eline, you sense DePalma's mocking 
it. The last scene scoffs at the idea of 
a truly happy ending, but these jabs at 
convention are thrown on top of a nov- 
el lurid enough tor three movies. 

"The Black Dahlia" boldly goes, 
and goes, and goes. And go-go-go- 
goes. It's the freakiest duckling of the

of all ages to follow llieir lead and cre-

"We tried to get things we could 
identify as recycled, things that retain 
(he characteristics of their original 
form," said Vidavcr, an Indiana Uni- 



versily master s student in Cthnomi

The items were then turned i 
art, following traditions of centuries 
past, and contemporary cultures across 
the globe. 

"We were interested m how peo- 
ple make use ot their environment for 
things they need," Moore said. "And 1 
do say need because an is necessary." 

Photos and brief histories of the 
cultural phenomenon of turning trash 
into treasure accompanied real-world 
examples. The exhibit is aimed at chil- 
dren, featuring mainly items made by 
fids and for kids, Moore said.

'Fast Food Nation' 
Reveals Truth Behind 
Fast-Food Chains 



By Jen Shark 
Daily Lobo 
U-wire 






Sometimes, the 
choice is lo grab a nice, big, 
juicy burger from Sonic or 
perhaps across ihe street at 
McDonald's. "Fast Food Na- 
tion," by Eric Schlosser, might 
change someone's mind the 
next time he or she decides to 
step under those golden arch- 
It is no secret how incred- 
ibly unhealthy fast food is, but 
Schlosser digs deep inio the 
history and successes of fast 
food. "Fast Food Nation" starts 
at the beginning of the fast- 
food industry with the stories 
of the founders. 

For example, the book has a 
story about hot dog stand own- 
er. Car! Karcher, who started 
the food drive-in trend. 

Karcher men inspired peo- 
ple like Robert Schullcr, who 
opened up the nation's first 

One hundred people lis- 
tened lo him preach on top 
of the snack bar of a drive-in 
movie theater while seated in 
their cars. 

It is fascinating to sec how 
many of Ihese multimillion- 
dollar industries started from 
college-age people trying to 
find a way to make extra mon- 
ey. As the book goes on, many 
facts about fast food, such as 
the fascinating world of flavor- 
ing, are revealed, 

I never knew how much 
food-processing companies 
rely on flavoring to sell their 



products. I used to be a huge 
fan of strawberry milk shakes - 
until I read this book. 
There arc more than 50 ingredi- 
ents in the artificial strawberry 
flavoring alone. That is far more 
ingredients than it takes to make 
j milk shake itself. 

Other flavor peculiarities 
are the grilled chicken sandwich 
from Wendy's, which contains 
beef extracts, and the argument 
that natural flavoring is more 
harmful than artificial flavoring, 
in meal products. 

However, I found myself 
wanting lo protesi meat for the 
way Ihe meat packing workers 
are treated. 

The chapter titled, "The 
Most Dangerous Job," made 
me feel like I was reading Up- 
ton Sinclair's "The Jungle." Not 
much has changed in terms of 
meat processing. 

Workers use incredibly 
long, sharp knives to cut the 
cow parts without protection 
and are barely compensated, if 
at all, for an injury on the job. 

This chapter was probably 
the most interesting part of the 
whole book and could have 
been a book on its own, 

I remember reading this 
chapter before bed and having 
terrible nightmares to think that 
such working conditions still 
exist in our country. 

This book is essential lo 
anyone who really wants to 
know what is going on behind 
the scenes of companies who 
are taking over our world at an 
ever-growing pace. 

1 challenge anyone to read 
this book and say they are not 
affected by what Schlosser has 
discovered and won't think 
twice when pulling up at the 
next drive-through line.

goal, but all four were denied 
by Emily Peick. who remained 
perfect in front of the Ramblers' 
net in ninety minutes of work. 

The Mastodon defense was 
worked over by the Ramblers in 
the game, allowing seventeen 
total shots to be taken and five 
shots on goal for the night. 

IPFW goalkeeper Shannon 
Lynn was able to ward off four 
of which, but allowed the two 
shots to sneak past her that made 
the difference in the contest. 
The win improved Loyola to 
4-3-1 and dropped the IPFW to 
2-4-0 on the season. 

Saturday's contest against 
Illinois State wouldn't prove to 
be any easier for the Mastodons, 
falling 4-0 to the Redbirds at 

The Redbirds were able to 
out shoot the Mastodons, with 
10 shots on goal versus IPFW's 
5. and a total shot ratio of 19-7 

Stefankiewicz commented 
on how Illinois State was able 
to run his Mastodons, "The girls 
just got fatigued in the second 
half. 



Illinois State, like many of 
IPFW's opponents, have more 
scholarships, and carry more 
personnel to each game, coupled 



with the reoccumng injury 
problems hitting his teams in 
recent years, has made playing 
these larger schools a real task. 

It was a match up of pretty 
equal teams on paper. 

IPFW was heading into the 
contest with a 2-4 record, and 
was looking to come out of 
the game one away from .500, 



the first half, with the Redbirds 
up one courtesy of Amanda 
Wisneiwski half way through 
the first half. 

However, Illinois State came 
out firing in the second half, 



The main factor plaguing 
IPFW this season is that their 
opponents are out scoring them 
7-0 in the first half of play. 
The Mastodons look to get 
redemption and kick-start their 
first half offense this Sunday on 
the road against the University 
of Wisconsin Green Bay.
