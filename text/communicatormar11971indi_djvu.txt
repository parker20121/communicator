This lypical "studeni radical" &gt;s likoly lo drive a V.W., thus 
keeping his image of being a poor student. Upon closer in-

throat of any candidal, 

is out to attack 'llieiT' 

fee." It is his implication 

of the "Greek system" in 

the retention of the Fee 

personal stand 

that I wish to 

this time. 

First of all, by referr- 

lo a "Greek system", 

! implying a Creek an- 

. This is hardly the 
', Siructually, there 
eight Creek organiza- 
tions. Each fraternity or 

entity, existing lo pursue 
its o^n goals. There is no 
Inter-Greek Council, 

Creeks pose no i 
on each other 

Creeks as a whole e 

any powers of arbilary dis- 
cipline over individual or- 
ganisation. This is also 

manifested functionally. 
Greeks go their own ways, 
doing what is best for 
their own organization. 
Combined effort activities, 
such as the Service 
feet this last Ch\ 



Itas Its own program 

are sufficient to fulfill Ihe 

individual needs of its 
members. The only con- 
nection any Greeks have 
with Ihe Fee is that some

dent Uni

mary recipient of the Acli 
vity Fee money. However 
this in no way justifie. 
Mr. Souder's calling i.

and not 



the rule. In fac 

competition over the years 
has reached such fierce 
proportions that they have 
been subject lo much cri- 
ticism, bath from within 
and from without, Greek 
rivalry is and should be in- 
tense. Creek unity is a 
misnomer; Greek disunity 
is much better. 

Secondly, Mr, Souder 
contends that Greeks have

anced by the Fee. This op- 
tion is available lo and uti' 



Hopefully I A„ue 
pointed oul that Mr, Sou- 
der's association of Greeks 
with a $15 Activity Fee is 
improper, unfair, andjn no 
way based on fact. Every 
Creek, I am sure, has his 
or her personal feelings 
about the Fee, but it is im- 
possible to assign a stand 
to a Greek organization, 
much less to the organiza- 
tions collectively. By do- 
ing so, Mr, Souder has done 
much harm to the integrity 
of each fraternity and sor- 
ority on Campus. I only 
hope that this letter will 
set the record straight, 
and that the damage done 
by Mr. Souder in the state-

Letter to the Editor 
Dear Miss Bosh 

I read with interest the 
article by Mr. Mark Souder 
on the "history" of ihe ac- 



dulged in one of his fre- 
queni flights of fantasy. 
He has alleged that there 
was "dishonesty" and 
"fraud" in their referendum

In the spring of 1968, I 
ran for student oody presi-

and I pledged that the first 

would be to hold an honest, 
meaningful referendum on 
the question of the activity 
fee increase. We ftepl ihaf- 
promise. The polls were open 
for 44 hours during ihe four 
days of the referendum. Fifty

the SLF was

the referendum were known. 
There was campaigning far 
and against the increase and 
all factions were represented 
on the election board which 
manned the polls, counted 
the ballots, and drew up the 
form of the ballot (which Mr. 
Souder contends was written

honest and I believe an indi- 
cation of student opinion at 
that time. 

The students voted to 
increase the activity fee in 
1968; if they wish lo lower 
it in 1971, I see no reason 
not to. After all, il is a stu-

bom with defects and in cases where the pregnant woman 
was menially defective or where the pregnancy hod resulted 
from rope or from on incestuous union. In 1967 o bill drawn 
up olong this guideline was inlroduced ond it almost dis- 
tinguished Indiana as the first stole to effect important 
change. With (he backing of groups as varied os the Indiana 
Stole Medical Association and the Indiana Council of 
Churches and with remarkably little publicity House bill 
1621 passed the House with ease. But with the resulting 
publicity and the solidified opposition of the Cotholic 
Church the bill wos chopped up in the Senote committee and 
the gutted remains which passed were interred by Governor 
Branigon's veto. In the succeeding four years half a do-^n 
stales have gotten reform bills through their legislotures 
intact and many more states hovo them in the works. The 
last two slates. New York ond Hawaii, passed general 
repeols of ihe prohibition on oborllons. New York did so 
afler previous unsuccessful ottempis lo enact "model 
code" relorm bills. There ore a number of reasons why 
simply voiding of the existing structures on oborlion is the 
more logical, the more feasible, ond the more just approach. 
Repeal seems the only effective way to keep the pregnant 
women out of the dongerous hands of the bock oiley obor- 
tionisl. Of the million or so obortiont now being performed 
each year, about 990,000 of those ore illegal. Even in 
Colorodo, in which the number ol legal oboilions jumped 
from SO lo 1000 per year ofter liboroMiation ihere ore still 
10,000 illegal abortions each yeors. Because of consider- 
able red tope, becouse of the necessity for the mother lo 
humiliate herself in justifying her oborlion, ond because ol 
fjospitol jurys which ollen work on the quoto system and 
pride themselves on how lew abortions they grant; many 
women do not act (osl enough or do not hove sullicient 
knowledge or the means to obtain obortions performed in a 
hospital. Furthermore, general repeal is more palatable to 
on increasing number of Cotholics and others who Ihinh 
that oborlion is murder catagoricolly regordless of circum- 
stances. They would rother hovo such on ultimote moral 
choicelolt up to Ihe individuol conscience than lo have a 
low wliich stoles under whol conditions murder is legal. 
The most solid legol orgument for repeol is that giving 
birth under compulsion is simply not an oppropriote meons 
of enforcing any moral or legol code tor it totally disregards 
the fate of ihe child ond in turn Ihe effect on society. Even 
in the rare cose of the woman whose pregnoncy and wish for 
for abortion is the result of completely selfish and irre- 
sponsible behavior, is it right to force the woman lo hove 
the child thus forcing ihot child to be raised in all probo- 
bilily without the maternal love and parentol protection 
r^ecessory for its mental heolth ond development. And 
knowing what we do about the roots of delinquent behavior,
