Orientation 
different from 
past programs 



By! 



VrKANKK 



' student orientation for 
be held Friday, 
January 18 at 2;00 p.m. will be unlike 
other orientations held in the past in 
many aspects. 

This orientation is a type of 
experiment according to coordinator 
Donna Brandt, associate director of 
the counseling and academic develop- 
ment division. '"If this program goes 
off well, we will probably organize 
next fall's orientation in the same 



i school c 

"We have always had a problem 
in the past with time conflicts. Many 
students have other responsibilities 
during vacation. We decided to have 
the orientation on Friday afternoon 
when class loads are usually very 
light." 

Another big difference in this 
program is the way it is organized. 
Many times in the past, new students 
have listened to several informative 
speeches as an introduction to the 
campus. 

During this program, the students 
will meet for a brief time in the 
ballroom of the Student Union. Then 
they will be split up into approximate- 
ly 10 groups. 

Each group will be given three 
tasks to accomplish on campus. 

These tasks will get the students 
involved in the different areas that 
they will have to be involved in during 
registration and during the rest of the 



Brock Able, student body presi- 
dent, will close the program with an 
introduction to the campus. 

At 4:30 p.m., there will be an ice 
cream social in the cafeteria in the 
Student Union. All students and staff 
are invited to attend. The deans will 
be serving the ice cream. 

Miss Brandt noted that Dan 
Motto, campus minister worked a 
lot on organizing this event. Also 
working on this event were students 
Able, Charles Pratt, John Perkins, 
Tracy White, and Elaine Jenkins. 

Approximately 150 students are 
expected to attend the o 



Communicator errs 
on AFT vote 

In the last issue of the Communi- 
cator, it was reported that the 
American Federation of Teachers 
(AFT) at Indiana-Purdue had voted 
that all candidates with previous 
affiliation to Indiana University or 
Purdue University should not be 
considered as candidates for super- 
chancellor. 

According to Stuart K. Lynn, 
assistant professor of economicsand 
treasurer of the group, no such vote 
was taken. The issue was brought 
before the AFT, but was never voted

Professors excluded from 
collective bargaining bill 



By REX PUTT 

College and university professors 
have been excluded from a proposed 
bill of collective bargaining for public 
employees to be introduced in the 1974 
State Legislature. 

The issue of collective bargaining 
for professors of higher education has 
been highly publicized in the past 
year. It had been predicted by 
collective bargaining supporters that 
there definitely would be a collective 
bargaining bill for college and uni- 
versity professors passed by the 1974 
State Legislature. 

In the absence of the bill the AFT 
is currently lobbying in the state 
legislature. The AFT has become 
strongly involved in protecting the 
rights of college and university 
professors, and currently is trying to 
draft model legislation to present to 
the State Legislature. 

Dr. Sheldon F. Gottlieb, president 
of the Purdue affiliation of the AFT in 
Fort Wayne, declared that the AFT 
"is highly in favor of a collective 
bargaining bill for college and 
university professors. Gottlieb 
strongly emphasized that the AFT is 
"very definitely" a supporter of 
collective bargaining rights. 

Dr. Gottlieb expressed his discon- 
tent of the absence of the bill by 
describing the action as a "form of 
class discrimination." 

He exclaimed, "by deliberatley 
excluding one designated group' the 
State Legislature has discriminated. 
They have provided access to 
everyone but one, and this is 
unconstitutional." 

Dr. Gottlieb indicated that there 
were several reasons for the absence 
of a collective bargaining bill 
pertaining to college and university 
professors. 

He acknowledged that the basic 
barrier is that there is definitely 
anti-intellectualism present in the 
State Legislature. 

Gottlieb feels that the campus 
unrest of the late 1%0's and early 
1970's is the decisive factor for this 
resentment toward the intellectual 

Because of these past problems at 
the colleges and universities, he feels 
the State Legislature is ignoring the 
professors as a form of punishment. 

Dr. Gottlieb still feels that the 
AFT can force the collective bargain- 
ing bill into legislation, and that the 



results. 

Lafayette wants the faculty at 
Fort Wayne to believe that the 
chances for adoption of a collective 
bargaining bill in the State Legisla- 
ture are very remote. 

The President's Committee on 
Collective Bargaining at Purdue in 
Lafayette has discouraged any 
chance of such a bill in the State 
Legislature. They announced in a 
faculty senate meeting on December 
15, 1973, that "it does not appear likely 
that we will be covered by a bill for 
the coming short legislative session." 

Faculty are still not covered 
under legislation in Indiana, and 
inappropriate as it might seem, the 



For example, one of the tasks is 
that: "Recently you received a 
parking ticket, and for the life of you, 
you don't know why. Take care of this 

After accomplishing the tasks, 
the groups will return to the ballroom 
and report on one of their tasks. 

Some other tasks involve finding 
out who certain people on campus are 
and bringing them back to orienta- 
tion, finding certain books for 
research in the library, dropping a 
class and finding out what will be 
shown during i 



Miss Brandt commented on the 
task forces: "We hope we are 
accomplishing all those dry things 



APO raises over $2000 
biking for Penny Pitch 



Radio station WOWO's recent 
Penny Pitch was more than $2,000 
richer, thanks to the bicycling efforts 
of an Indiana-Purdue service organi- 

Members of Alpha Phi Omego

Mall. Working on the project were

finished first," he added. 

A total of 510 miles were ridden on 
the exercise bicycle. 

Pedal pushers for the first annual 
APO event were: Steve Beck. Bill 
Elward, Brian Houlihan, Ken Howes, 
Mary Beth Jackson, Noreen Jones, 



The group averaged $52.30 and 
over 12 miles per hour. Four dollars 
and 25 cents was the average gain per 



faculty is not covered under the bill 
presently being introduced to the 
Senate. It is interesting to note that 
groups specifically excluded from 
this collective bargaining bill for 
public employees are state prison 
convicts, inmates of state mental 
institutions, and FACULTY. 

Professor David Kessler, chair- 
man of the committee on collective 
bargaining, reported that the basic 
niiture of the university would change 
drastically if collective bargaining 
was ultimately put into effect. 

He also suspected that any 
legislation would place the faculty 
under the Indiana Education Employ- 
ment Relations Board, which would 
not be a good move for 



AAUP member at the IU-PU Fort 
Wayne campus, noted that the 
"AAUP endorses the principle of 
collective bargaining." 

They, too, are lobbying in the 
State Legislature in support of 
collective bargaining for college and 



university professors, 

Hollander also implied that "if we 
(professors) can get a law through 
(Legislation) to unionize, then the 
university (administration) will be so 
scared, we won't have to unionize." 

Dr. Dwight Henderson, one of the 
prominent young professors repre- 
senting the Indiana side at the Fort 
Wayne campus, felt that collective 
bargaining for this University was 
imperative. 

He added, "Not so much that the 
university administration has treated 
the faculty badly, but the legislature 
just hasn't been forthcoming with the 
money. That's sort of the key, as last 
year for the first time some of the 
second level administrators (division 
chairmen) got to see our total 
budget. 

"In collective bargaining if you 
negotiate a contract with the trustees 
or legislature and you say the faculty 
should get a per cent increase, you 
can get it. It makes some aspects of 
our job a lot easier, particularly when 
a salary scale is included. Most 
Indiana administrators, at least at the 
lower level, don't fear collective 



bargaining at all." 

The faculty at Fort Wayne have 
been victims of several years of very 
bad faculty increments. The cost of 
living has been double of what the 
faculty got in raises. This is one of the 
most substantial arguments in favor 
of collective bargaining, and possibly 
a primary reason for the State 
Legislature's failure to adopt a 
collective bargaining bill for college 



In 



earlier Purdue Faculty 
Senate meeting it was moved, "Be 
resolved that the Purdue University 
Fort Wayne Faculty Senate be polled 
immediately on the following ques- 
tion: 'Do you believe that collective 
bargaining is an appropriate mechan- 
ism for teachers in higher education 
to negotiate contracts with their 
employees?'" 



that even though every faculty 
member might not favor collective 

bargaining il is a! the stage where it 
could become a reality. 



Faculty hears report on 
additional support money 



By REX PUTT 

Clifford Nault, chairman of P.U. 
English department, presented a 
report to the Purdue Faculty Senate 
entitled "Means of Providing Addi- 
tional Support to the Faculty in Lieu 
of Actual Dollar Increments," pre- 
pared by Faculty Affairs Committee. 

This action by the committee 
stemmed from the dissatisfaction 
expressed by the faculty regarding 
salary increases. In the past two 
' n faculty salaries has 

U i -

Dean Roger Manges had original- 
ly requested in May of 1973 that 
members of the Faculty Affairs 
Committee should meet with him to 
prepare a plan of action in response to 
the financial crisis. 



The dean and director had asked 
for suggestions as to what things 
could be funded beyond increments if 
the increments could not be changed 
for the 73-74 year. 

In a previous meeting of the Sixth 
Faculty Affairs Committee, two 
actions were recommended for con- 
sideration, and the second finally 
approved. 

The action calls for the dean and 
director to allocate the available 
money to a fund to be divided among 
the several academic sections accord- 
ing to size, measured on a full time 
faculty per capita basis. Within the 
section each faculty member may 
allocate his proportion of the avail- 
able money as he wishes so long as the 
request or requests fall within the 
legitimate budget categories. 



In other faculty senate action 
Nault moved acceptance of a docu- 
ment entitled "Ad Hoc Joint Steering 
Committee." 

This disposition, which was 
accepted, called for an Ad Hoc Joint 
Steering Committee to be established 
in order to recommend to the Fort 
Wayne Senates the administrative

ilignm 
campus. 

The Steering Committee will have 
the following responsibilities: 

1) conducting open hearings 
designed to uncover problems in- 
volved in eventual merger of the two 
universities at Fort Wayne; 

2) to appoint task forces to 
consider realignment problems; 

3) to forward steering committee 
and-or task force recommendations 
through the appropriate agenda 
committee.

A CHANGING WORLD 



Army's candor wins recruits 



Basketball tickets 

This newspaper traditionally has supported the IU-PU athletic 
programs, both inter-collegiate and intramural. So long as the full-time 
students are taxed five dollars each semester to finance athletics, every 
effort should be made to make these programs as strong and appealing as 
possible. 

Intramurals usually get good participation from the students and 
staff of the campus. It is the varsity sports that tend to go unnoticed by all 
but the team members. 

The athletic office, the Students' Government, the Communicator 
and others have tried to change this student apathy for varsity teams, but 
to little or no avail But leave it to the Joint Athletic Advisory Committee 
to concoct a fool-proof scheme to change all this. 

To refresh your memory, the athletic committee is the one that takes 
$40,000 of student tax money each year and spends it with only token 
student input It was the athletic committee which last fall retroactively 
decided to enforce NCAA rules at this non-member campus. The result 
was the forfeiture of all won or lost soccer games and one cross-country 
match. 

But now the athletic committee has outdone itself, tt reasoned that 
nobody shows up to basketball games because they are free. Therefore, 
all thai needs to be done is to charge admission and then students will 
beat down the doors trying to get in. 

Of course everyone can't be charged admission. Activity card 
holders must be let in free, or the committee can no longer justify its 
S-IO, 000 annual endowment. So activity card holders will be admitted free 
at the door, and to make these students think they are really getting a 
good deal, they will be entitled to two tickets if they are picked up in 
advance. That sounds like one heck of a deal, until you remember that 
activity card holders used to get as many free tickets as they wanted. 

And that is not all Every team member, cheerleader, coach, and 
statistician will get six, yes, six, free tickets to each game. The 
committee members, complimenting themselves for the hard work they 
have done this year, voted themselves two free tickets per game. (Don't 
break your arms, boys and girls.) 

The usual crowd of 23 thai watches the Mastodons play will now 
shrink to about 12, all of these being family of the players. After all, no 
student is going to pay 50 cents and get a break from the dollar general 
admission only if he happens to be carrying his university fee receipt - to 
see the Mastodons play. 

Probably fewer students will show up to watch the games. And 
probably this will give the athletic committee incentive to start charging 
the players admission.

Quotes to 
remember 



The habit of reading is one of the 
greatest resources of mankind; and 
we enjoy reading books that belong to 
us much more than if they are 
borrowed. A borrowed book is like a 
guest in the house; it must be treated 
with punctilio 



seldom done, you really ought to 

But your own books belong to 
you; you treat them with that 

affectionate intimacy that annihilates 
formality. Books are for use, not for 
show; you should own no book that 
you are afraid to mark up, or afraid to 
place on the table, wide open and face 
down. A good reason for marking 
favorite passages in books is that this 
practice enables you to remember 
more easily the significant sayings, to 



tion is concerned, military life s 
a shade less objectionable. The oil 
shortage has made a job dent in 
hundreds of industries and the 
"guaranteed" pay of the military 
service offers attractions along with 
the opportunity to get free training in 
skills that may be useful later in 

These aspects of today's Army 
help, but the two factors most 
important in recent recruiting suc- 

1. The Army at long last is 
keeping its promise when it entices 
some qualified young man or woman 
to sign on the dotted line by saying, 
"We guarantee you'll be assigned to 
Europe." 

2. The whole recruiting program 
is computerized nationwide under a 
system called "Request" (Recruit 
Quota System). Computers don't lie 
and they are color blind. 

This means that a qualified 
automobile mechanic knows before 
he signs up that if there is a vacancy 
in the Army for a mechanic he will get 
the job; a guarantee against getting 
assignment as a cook, or a cook 
getting assignment as a tank gunner. 
It also means that blacks and other 
minority race men and women are 
guaranteed against any semblance of 
racial discrimination in assignment. 
Additionally, it means a great deal to 
women's libbers because in 430 of the 
480 skills available in the Army, the 
computer is also "sex-blind." Fifty 
combat assignments still are for men 

The computerized enlistment suc- 
cesses have been made possible 
through equipment provided by 
Computer Sciences Corp. of Los 
Angeles - and through the more 
sophisticated approach of what the 
Army today calls the career counsel- 
or, a fancy name for recruiting 
sergeant. 

Whatever the name, the system 
works. The "counselor" feeds a 
prospective soldier's qualification

Congressman finds energy worries

give Congressmen the opportunity to

Perhaps the most frequently 

discussed topic in the Fourlh District 
is the energy situation With record 
snowfalls at the end of December. 
Northeastern Indiana residents, my-

Therefore, I want to take this 
opportunity to review with you some 
of the steps Congress took in 1973 to 
cope with the growing energy crisis 

First. I think it is importan! that 
we keep the energy situation in 
perspective - we must consider it 
together with other priorities of equal 
magnitude. What I have in mind is the 
growing call for abandoning the great 
strides we have made in -ecent years 
in environmental protection because

By JEFFREY ST. JOHN 

"Political power is like nuclear 
energy," observes Yale Prof. James 
Barber in his book, The Presidential 
Character, "available to create 
deserts or make them bloom,.." 

The Watergate affair has convin- 
ced a great many Americans that our 
political system has become an 
immoral desert. The recommended 
remedies and reforms, however, fail 
to deal with the primary causes for 
political corruption. Essentially the 
sources of political corruption that 
produced Watergate are twofold: 
growing concentrat ion of power in the 
hands of government and its enor- 
mous control over the U. S. economic 
system. 

Recently, a stream of business 
executives appeared before the Sen- 

Vatergate Committee to testify on

w^xera. armybmss, rva-yy dtzlss, boondo$a)ers 
TVA uoc, junket beys, ptywi] pollers, etcjete . 



George A. Spater, former board 
'chairman of American Airlines, told 
the Watergate probers: "I was 
motivated by a host of fears, that we 
would get less than an even break 
from government if we failed to 
contribute." Spater described how 
such solicitations were accompanied 
by the implied threats that if 
contributions, in the amount demand- 
ed, were not forthcoming American 
Airlines could expect trouble from the 
government. 

Claude C. Wild, vice president of 
Gulf Oil, told Watergate probers that 
his company gave because there now 
exist SI federal agencies "that can. in 
one way or another, affect Gulf's 
business." Orin Atkins, president of 
Ashland Oil, told how he used a 
foreign subsidiary of Ashland in 
Africa to funnel an illegal campaign 
contribution to "assure ourselves of a 
forum to be heard in the councils of 
government." 

Both Atkins and Wild testified 
that the lone of solicitations was such 
that they had no option but to give. 
Sen Sam Ervin asked Atkins whether 
in fact this amounted lo extortion The 
head of Ashfand Oil, without hesita- 
tion, acknowledged that it was a form 
of extortion. 

The lesson of Watergate in 
general and the testimony of business 
executives in particular apparently 
have been lost on those clamoring for 
reform. Namely, the way to prevent 
future Watergates and illegal political 
campaign contributions is to remove 
the enormous power government 
holds over all phases of the economy. 

We now know, moreover, that 
bribery and extortion reached into the 
second -highest office in the land, the 
vice presidency. 

"I admit that I did receive 
payments," Spiro Agnew told a 
Baltimore district court on Oct. 10, 
"during the year of 1967 which were 
not expended for political purposes 
and that, therefore, these payments 
were income taxable to me in that 
year, and that 1 so knew. I further 
acknowledge that 



awarded by state agencies in 1967 and 
other years to those who made such 
payments, and that I was aware of 
such awards. I am aware that 
government witnesses are prepared 
to testify that preferential treatment 
was accorded to the paying compan- 
ies pursuant to an understanding with 
me when I was governor." 

It is clear that the sources of 
political corruption, bribery and 
extortion flow from the power of 
government, at all levels, to control 
the public purse, including control 
over private industries. 

It is also clear that these 
practices did not begin in 1968, but 
were, and undoubtedly still are in 
many levels, "part of doing business" 
and thus have been institutionalized 
when dealing with government. 

The peril this poses to our 
political institutions was recently 
spelled out by the respected public 
opinion pollster Samuel Lubell in his 
book, "The Future While It Happ- 
ened," Lubell warns - as a result of 
his analysis of the 1972 presidential 
election and powers of the executive 
branch over our economic system - 
that our republican representative 
government is in grave danger. The 
Watergate scandal, like the scandals 
of the last century, are the direct 
product of all-powerful government. 

"All the significant scandals of 
the 19th Century," wrote Dr. George 
Roche III in his own work, The 
Bewildered Society, "were closely

U.S. universities 
need limiting 



By DAVID PIETRUSZA 

As the recent vicissitudes of the 
supply and cost of beef have proved to 
even the most hard-hearted and 
incorrigible of statists, the free 
market does not bear tampering with. 
Two years of governmental controls 
have turned a food glut into a food 
shortage, with higher prices and 
lower profits for everyone up and 
down the line. Once again, the big 
brother of governmental power has 
stepped in to assure a Utopia for 
everyone and has merely discovered 
that not even Congress and the 
President could repeal the law of 
supply and demand. 

While the lesson is finally being 
learned in regard to food prices and 
supplies, nothing still, it appears, has 
yet been learried in regard to the 
government's wanton and profligate 
subsidization of higher education. 

The rush to achieving the idea of 
"a college education for everyone" 
had its roots in several premises. 
First, there was supposed to be a 
shortage of competent and qualified 
teachers in the nation. Actually, this 
scarcity was caused less by a lack of 
certified teaching personnel, than by 
the exodus of teachers from the 
profession due to the then relatively 
low salaries received by those 
choosing to pursue a career in 
education. Teachers left their profes- 
sion in droves for greener pastures. 
The fly in the educational ointment 
was not in the initial lack of skilled 
instructors, but in the profesion's 
inability to hold competent individu- 
als in the face of higher paying, 
competing industries and vocations. 

Strangely enough, now that there 
is an almost incalculable surplus of 



i lavish levels, 
though they would have no difficulties 
in finding teaching personnel, nowa- 
days, even if they were to cut 
teacher's salaries considerably. 

Secondly, in the government's 
rationale for expanding higher educa- 
tion was the fear that we were being 
overtaken scientifically by the Soviet 
Union and that as a matter of national 
security, government money should 
be pumped into the universities in the 
form of grants and loans. The initial 
idea was not a particularly bad one as 
bureaucratic ideas go, but once again 
as in most governmental programs, 
the taxpayer's generosity was ab- 
used, and vast sums were wasted on 
frivolous projects. 

The third major reason for the 
creation of the 1960's overblown 
educational complex was the most 
harmful and foolhardy of all. A 
college diploma was a magical key to 
wealth, health, and happiness, the 
common belief went. If we simply 
handed out sheepskins to everyone, 
everyone would be rich and famous 
and wise and happy. 

It didn't quite work out. With the 
skillful aid of millions and millions of 
deflated tax dollars, a college degree 
itself was devalued to the status of an 
almost meaningless bauble. College 
nmonly clerk in 
n tables, deliver 
mail, repair bicycles, and wait, wait 
endlessly for something better to 
come along. 

Part of the reason for this, of 
course, is that there are simply not 
enough high-level, high paying posi- 
tions to go around. In addition to this, 
the average college graduate is, to put 
it plainly, not as sharp as his 
predecessors. The Federal Service 
Entrance Examination-the entrance 
into federal service for most college 



graduates-regularly sees better than 
half of its applicants fail to attain 
even the minimum cut-off score, A 
portion of the recent New York State 
Professional Careers Test saw nearly 
80 per cent of those taking the test 
(and 10,000 young people took the test 
on the one day it was given) fail. 
State governors and local politi- 



Instead they have reacted with an 
absolute faith in the doctrine of 
"College Degrees For All" and call 
for still more aid to the colleges and 
more scholarships for deserving 
young people (and now that 18 year 
olds can vote, you can be assured that 
they are all deserving.) 

The president of a local branch of 
Behemoth U. once remarked that 
"the concept of a limitless (univer- 
sity) was a dream and we realize that &gt; 
it must be brought into reality." 
Exactly what he meant by the 
"limitless university" I do not know. 
He probably wasn't sure either. But 
one thing which 1 am sure of was that 
the idea was a pernicious one. 

The limitless university would not 
have benefited the ever suffering, 
ever harried, taxpayer. This we can 
be sure of. He has already thrown 
away enough money on the schemes 
of various other big spenders. The 
limitless university would not benefit 
its prospective students either in 
response to a higher quality of 
education or in even improving his 
future financial status. The limitless 
university would not even benefit the 
physical plant of most universities, 
because many are now too large, too 
impersonal, too sterile. 

If the American Educational 
Empire is not to expand, what then 



problems and frustrations? Or shall il 
take the obvious (but never really 
seriously considered) option? 

The concept of cutting back, 
across the line and drastically, in 
education, may seem audacious at 
first thought because it seems to be a 
reactionary approach, purely nega- 
tive in tone. Yet, its benefits are 
. They include: 
improved teacher-student 



student 

3. a closer, more intimate, fee 
of campus community 

a saving to the taxpayer 



Thus all segments of society 
benefit from the reduction in the size 
of student bodies. Some will say, "But 



expense?" The t 
not The student now excluded (and he 
would necessarily be of the lower 
academic ratings), as things now 
stand, attends college in an overcrow- 
ed atmosphere, hardly conducive to 
real intellectual discipline, and upon 
graduation find himself in an equally 
overcrowded job market, either 
unemployed or forced to work for 
wages far below the expectations of a 
college graduate. In the meantime 
many skilled trades face tremendous 
labor shortages, in part caused by 
labor union intransigence, and partly 
by the stampede to the campus. For 
the graduate's low st&amp;tus, he has 
received four years of "education", 
but spent large sums on tuition and 
has lost four years of earning power.

QUESTION: Many times after I hav&lt; 



i has always gone away 



ANSWER: Painful urination may be a sign of a bladder or 

kidney jnfeclion. When (his occurs following intercourse as 
you describe, it is often a sign that bacteria have been 
introduced inlo the bladder during intercourse and infection 
has occurred. Such an infection should be treated and not be 
allowed to just disappear by itself. 

Women are more susceptible to urinary tract infections 
than men because the urethra 'the tube carrying urine from 
the bladder oul ) is very short allowing bacteria to find their 
way into the bladder. This can occur following intercourse 
because of direel and vigorous stimulation of the urethra by 
the shaft of the penis. 

In addition to treatment of the urinary tract infection 
which should take precedence, attempls must be made to 
prevent future infections. A careful examination by a 
urologist should be made to determine if there are any 
abnormalities of the urethra or bladder. A woman subject 
to such frequent infections is quite likely to have 
predisposing circumstances within the bladder which make 
il more susceptible to infection. Such women often have a 
pattern of urinating rather infrequently during the day 
which permits large amounts of urine to remain in the 
bladder much of the time, increasing pressure on the 
bladder wall and disturbing its blood supply. Therefore, 
such women are advised to urinate every two to three hours 
during the day. In addition, they should urinate 
immediately before having intercourse and as soon as 
possible after having intercourse. This will decrease the 
likelihood of bacteria growing. 

Changes of position in sexual intercourse to avoid 
stimulation of the urethra are suggested by some 
physicians, but it is questionable as to whether such 
effective since it is pretty hard to have 



hard, refers to the mineral content of the water and 
untreated well water contains a lot of stuff that will 
precipitate out in drinking glasses. In particular, if you use 
ice cubes in your drinking water you will get a tremendous 
amount of fuzz because the minerals in the water 
precipitate during freezing. None of this is harmful and in 
fact, some people feel strongly that hard water has some 
health advantages that soft water lacks. There is a small 
possility that there is some detergent residue on your dishes 
which is causing foaming when you fill the glass with water. 
The likelihood of your drinking water being contaminated 
with detergent is not very high. 

The orange color is due to rust. Most sources of drinking 
water contain ample amounts of rust which usually settles 
in pipes. Any disturbance of the pipes such as construction 
work or sudden increase in water pressure would churn up 
the rust and liberate it into the drinking water. This is also 
not dangerous. 

QUESTION: How can you explain the somnolence which 
happens after lunch and what kind of person is subjected to 
this? 

ANSWER: 1 cannot explain sleepiness which occurs after 
lunch. I do not even know much about what kind of person is 
affected, except that I am one of them.

The Chess Club is meeting regularly this s 
room 112 of the Student Union on Tuesdays from 3:30 to • 
5:30. During the fall semester the club met on Tuesdays 
under the sponsorship of Professor John Richardson of the 
Computer Technology Department. Professor Richardson 
lectured on basic ideas behind chess opening play, went 
over games with club members, and analyzed interesting 
games played by club members. 

Chess is becoming very popular on university 
campuses throughout the United States as indicated by the 
major college team tournaments held over the Christmas 
holidays. Whether you are a novice or an advanced player, 
you will find good competition at the IU-PU Chess Club. All 
newcomers are welcome on Tuesdays at 3:30 in room 112 of 
the Student Union.

THE BATTLE OF THE BOWL 

Well, sports fans, it's been an interesting vacation as 
far as sports excitement goes Usually the typical sports 
columnist would dedicate his space to Super Bow I VIII, but 
since I fell asleep after the first half, I'll have to change the 

It's been a little confusing for the average football 
spectator to try and keep up with all the bowl games which 
took place during the holiday. There was the Hula Bowl. 
Sugar Bowl, Orange Bowl, Rose Bowl, Astro-BIuebonnet 
Bowl (one of the biggies), Senior Bowl, Gator Bowl, and 
Fiesta Bowl— just to name a few. Indiana-Purdue was one 
of the few schools not involved in post season competition. 

I must admit that almost every time I turned on a 
football game last week I saw either John Cappelleti or 
David Jaynes. Then there must have been about three or 
four regional games like the North-South game, Blue-Gray 
contest, and the East-West classic. Thank goodness 
football's almost over so that the fans can recuperate. 

INDIANA BASKETBALL 

In college basketball, the "mother" schools (Indiana 
and Purdue) are both doing al! right. Purdue is currently 
leading the Big Ten with a 3-0 mark with victories over 
Michigan State, Northwestern and Illinois The real test to 
see if the Boilers are a fluke will be when they host 
Michigan next Monday night.

The big question most people bring up about the eventual 
outcome is whether Bill Walton will play or not. I still think 
that UCLA can win without Big Bill. At least John Wooten 
can visit Gilbert's Men Store again.

THE FIGHT OF THE C 

One interest sporting event that's coming up is the 
January 28 meeting of two ex-heavyweight champs— Mu- 
hammad AH and Joe Frazier. It will be a battle to 
determine which fighter will probably give up the busf 'ss 
and the other try for Foreman. Either fighter can't affc . d a 
loss— especially Ali. 

I'm going to put my money on Ali because "Smokin" 
Joe softened up after Foreman put him in outer space with a 
couple of hard rights in their last encounter. I wonder if 
Frazier happened to see the comet Kahoutek with all the 
other stars he saw that night? 

WHO'S THE MANAGER? 

Roughly a month ago, there were three baseball teams 
short a manager— the Yankees, the Tigers, and the A's. 
Now one month later, the Tigers and Yanks have found 
their field bosses while nobody wanted to team up with 
Charlie Finley's crew. 

The boys from the Bronx picked up Bill Virdon, 
ex-Pirate mentor, while the Tigers acquired Ralph Houk, 
last year's Yankee head. But what about the A's? 

Charlie 0. blocked a deal that had Dick Williams going 
to the Yankees, figuring he would return to the friendly 
Oakland group. But Tricky Dicky said "no way" and 
became a top aide to a Florida billionaire. 

It will be interesting to see if Oakland can get another 
"puppet" to run the show. At least Williams had enough 



guts to break his strings.
