THE GREAT TREE 
OPYCOMEBAGK^ 





By Said EL-Dajani 

itidajuiiagnuil com 



Monday, the 29th of 
2007 marked the first tree 
planted by Friends of the 
Parks this year. The event 
was a kick-off for the Gth 
annual Great Tree Cano- 
py Comeback. 

Why plant trees in the 
community? 

Besides the aesthetic 
^tor that trees hold 
beauty in nature, trees 
align streets, provide 
shade, reduce storm run- 
off, absorb pollutants, 
reduce utility costs for 
nearby buildings, and in- 
crease real estate value. 

Over the last 50 years, 
Fort Wayne and its parks 
have lost close to 50% 
of its tree canopy. The 
loss of these trees is due 
to weather and disease, 
which is normal. 

However, because an- 
nual tree replanting has 
not kept up with these 
natural losses, the city's 
public parks are in dan- 
ger of becoming increas- 
in^y bare of trees- if the 
trend is not reversed. 

It wasn't after Friends of 
the Parks, a non-for prof- 
it, all-volunteer organi- 
zation founded in 2000 
raised enough money 
for and commissioned 
three Cultural Landscape 
reports (CLR). These 
comprehensive studies 
of Fort Wayne's parks, in- 



cluding aerial 

tions, were completed in 

diefaUof2002. 

The results revealed the 
critical loss since 1949. 

That same fall of 2002, 
the Great Tree Canopy 
Comeback was orga- 
nized. The cause, now 
in its 6th year, is a com- 
munity tree-planting 
project launched by 
Friends of the Parks and 
the Fort Wayne Parks &amp; 
Recreation Department, 
whom can boast more 
than 1200 trees since it 
began in 2002. 

The Cherry tree was 
planted byAl Moll, Direc- 
tor of Fort Wayne Parks, 
lames Christian, Land- 
scape Supervisor of Fort 
Wayne Parks, Bill Brown, 
County Commissioner 
and the department staff. 
Ken Wilkinson, Direc- 
tor of Adams Township 
Parks and Recreadon De- 
partment participated. 
Wilkinson represented 
New Haven, where 11 
of the 210 trees will be 
planted, and contribute 
to an overall movement 
of awareness and acdon 
to a worthy cause. 

Michelle Briggs We- 
daman, a volunteer at 
Friends of the Parks rec- 
ognizes the movement 
and fast development 
of rural land. " Central 
Park in New York was 
developed in the 1860's, 
during the midst of the 
american industrial 



year. 

The rapidity of devel- 
opment and concentra- 
don in commercial and 
resdiential groivth should 
only feed the need for 
trees and parks. 

"Park space is more at- 
tractive and people have 
a choice of where they 
to live," said Weda- 
man. "These park spaces 
are our joint responsibili- 
ty and amidst the climate 
change, we can make a 
real differene by planting 
one tree." 

Dense vibrant cities 
are argueablly in higher 
demand due to finan- 
cial benefits. Fort Wayne 
and its reasonable cost 
of living is an attractive 
enviomment with po- 
tential. 

This potential is recog- 
nized by a small strong 
group that hopes its resi- 
dents can pardcipate in 
the beautificadon and 
growth of our commu- 
Tuty.

VULDEK I wO &amp;VOTe CONDOM 



By Jess Davis 

U-WIRE 

At 8:30 on a brisk Sun- 
day morning, several 
hundred people gath- 
ered in a huddle in front 
of McKissick Museum on 
the Horseshoe, awaiting 
their hero: South Caroli- 
na's favorite son. 

Comedian-turned- 
candidate Stephen Col- 
bert spoke for only five 
minutes to the crowd, a 
mixture of students and 
other faiis, but kept the 
crowd alternately laugh- 
ing and cheering. 

He defended his run for 
president as serious, yet 
his speech was anything 
but. 

Patriotic music blared 
through the loudspeak- 
ers and his fans waved 
poster board signs, many 
also clutching cups of 
coffee. 

Caidin Audette, a third- 



year 

student, and a groupof 

her friends, had waited 

on the Horseshoe since 

7:45 a.m. for front-row 

positions to see Colbert's 

speech. 

"It's Stephen Colbert," 
said Audette of why she 



woke up so early. "The 
Colbert magic." 

"He would be the best 
president ever," says her 
friend Robbie Munsey, 
a second-year elemen- 
tary education smdent. 
He clarified: "In seri- 
ousness, probably not, 
but it's a good idea." 

By 9 a.m. the crowd 
had swelled, with stu- 
dents climbing trees for 
better glimpses of Col- 
bert. He finally made 
his entrance, to an exu- 
berant greeting line and 
deafening screams from 
the crowd. 

Mayor Bob Coble wel- 
comed Colbert and read 
a proclamation before 
giving him the key to 
the city. 

"We are honored to 
welcome South Caroli- 
na's favorite son," Coble 
said. He declared Oct. 28 
"Stephen Colbert Day," 

"What an honor to re- 
ceive this," the Charles- 
Ion native said. Playing 
off a popular segment of 
his show, Colbert said, 
"Today's word is tSame- 
cock." 

He joked about the ex- 
treme reactions of the 
crowd. 



"You all must be thrilled 
to have me here," he said. 
"I love South Carolina al- 
most as much as South 
Carolina loves me." 

A minute into his speech, 
Colbert revealed the first 
part of his platform: 

"I have a promise to 
make to you," he said. "If 
elected, I will crush the 
state of Georgia. 

'And for good measure, 
the state of Tennessee." 
He expounded on peach- 
es, calling South Carolina's 
peach crop "more numer- 
ous, more delicious and 
more juiciful" than those 
from Georgia. 

"Their fuzziness is un- 
paralleled," he said. 

He then moved to a topic 
that has had media pun- 
dits and politicos furi- 
ously debating for the past 
week, since he announced 
his candidacy. 

"This campaign is real," 
he said. He said he wants 
to end rumors he's not a 
serious candidate. Colbert 
plans to run in the South 
Carolina Republican and 
Ocmacratic primariGs - 
and nowhere else. 

Before and after he 
spoke, people passed 
around petitions to gath- 



er enough signatures so 

Colbert would not have 
to pay the entry fee into 
the Democratic primary. 

In the same tone that 
top tier Republicans and 
Democrats say they have 
crisscrossed the country 
talking to voters, Colbert 
said he had spent the 
past 18 hours campaign- 
ing across South Caro- 
lina - from Charieslon to 
Columbia. 

He spoke Saturday at 
the College of Charles- 
ton. 

He kept the audience 
laughing and cheering, 
even as he talked about 
Innovista, where, he said, 
"scientists ivill live next 
to their experiments" to 
ensure they mutate first 
should any problems 
arise. 

Then, as quickly as he 
had come, he was gone, 
with the parting words, 
"Go Cocks!" 

The students who came 
said diey were fans of his 
show, and were unsure if 
they'd ever vote for him. 

"It was awosome," said 
Kendall Webb, a fourth- 
year broadcast journal- 
ism student. 

Webb, thrilled that she 



got to touch Colbert's 
arm. said she was disap- 
pointed in how short his 
speech was. 

Dyer said he would 
probably vote for Col- 
ben. 

"He's no worse than any 
of the other dopes run- 
ning," Dyer said. 

Keith Black, a first-year 
broadcast 
journal 



said of Colbert's rtm for 
president. 

Dennis Nichols, who 
graduated USC in 2005, 
said he came to hear the 
speech for its "absurdity." 
He said Colbert's candi- 
dacy was a good change 
of pace from typical poli- 
tics, which are leaving 
people disillusioned. 

"His speech was 

jusl like his show," 

Nichols said. "Hilari- 

Nichols was 

signing a petition to 
get Colbert on the 
ballot, but said he 
wouldn't vote for him 
unless he could vote 
both prima- 
ries.

Myanmar 



Using Facebook 
for social cliange? 



By Lindsay Guentzel 

u-wmE 

Students rally for peo- 
ple of Myanmar 
By using Facebook, cam- 
paign supporters can 
post photos outlawed by 
the junta. 
By Lindsay Guentzel 

on Sept. 26, the main 
Internet link in Myanmar 
was cut and 

many of the country's 
newspapers were forced 
to halt production after 
the country's military re- 
gime threatened further 
anti-junta protesting. 

Still, this hasn't stopped 
students from rallying 
support for the Burmese 
people through the pop- 



ular social networking 
Web site Facebook. 

Anti-violence groups 
and events have been 
popping up on the site 
throughout the past few 
weeks as the situation in 
Myanmar has violendy 
heated up. 

Pyi Maung, an archi- 
tecture junior, lived in 
Myanmar until 2003 
when he moved to the 
United States for college. 
His siblings have all left 
Myanmar, but his par- 
ents still live there. 

Maung said he hopes 
the movement on Face- 
book spreads to students 
who might not know 
about the situation in 
Myanmar. 



"There was another up- 
rising in 1988 but people 
didn't know that," Maung 
said. "But this time, be- 
cause of the Internet ac- 
cess and use, students 
know that and have more 
awareness." 

Brandon Erickson, an 
active member of the 
United States Campaign 
of Burma and the Bur- 
mese American Demo- 
cratic Alliance, said he 
uses Facebook to invite 
friends to Burmese sup- 
port events and rallies. 

"I think we should keep 
capitalizing on it and re- 
ally use it to get people 
more involved so that 
actual change can hap- 
pen." Erickson said. 

However, he said he 
hopes students expand 



their research beyond 
the Web site. 

"It's a starting point, 
it's aj-eally great starting 
point." he said. 

Created Sept. 19, the 
Facebook group "Sup- 
port the Monks' protest 
in Burma" has 252,144 
members from around 
the world. 

The group's page con- 
tains 34 videos and more 
than 400 posted items 
such as pictures, person- 
al accounts and links to 
other Web sites. The site 
also mentions "A Day of 
International Action for 
a Free Burma," an initia- 
tive that is scheduled to 
commence Oct. 6. 

The group is hoping to 
raise support for the Bur- 
mese monks and citizens 
affected through the 
marches, which mem- 



bers hope will happen in 
cities worldwide. 

Even if the Facebook 
members aren't able to 
attend the event, they are 
still being made aware of 
the situation, Erickson 
said. 

Because of the limited 
phone use and lack of 
Internet, Maung said he 
hasn't spoken to his par- 
ents in two weeks. 

People in Myanmar are 
afraid to talk about the 
current political situa- 
tion because they are 
afraid of the military re- 
gime, he said. 

"You just talkabout how 
your family is." 

Joanne, a Minneapo- 
lis resident who didn't 
want to release her last 
name because of poten- 
tial backlash from Myan- 
mar's military regime, 



was in Myanmar at the 
end of August and was 
aware of the Burmese 
citizens' fear. 

"You're really not even 
able to talk to people 
about what's going on 
in the government," she 
said. "Our tour guide 
would sometimes say, '[ 
don't know what you are 
talking about.' But when 
we were privately with 
her, she was much more 
like, 'It's terrible, it's re- 
ally terrible.' " 

Because the situation in 
Myanmar is constantly 
changing, it's important 
for those concerned to 
post information and 
updates on Web sites like 
Facebook, Erickson said. 

The ability to upload 
posts, videos and photos 
has given power to the 
citizen -reporter, Erick- 
son said. 




Halloween...Scary? 



By Douglas Schmidt 

SdundnO 1 8 i p fM.ed u 

Halloween is an odd 
holiday Most holidays 
are devoted to virtues: 
thankfulness, love, for- 
giveness, behaviors we 
want to encourage. Hal- 
loween is different. Hal- 
loween is a day dedicated 
to ghosts, vampires and 
serial killers. How can we 
explain such a holiday? 
Why do we have an an- 



nual celebration of hor- 
ror? 
As counterintuitive as it 
sounds, we spend a great 
deal of time chasing after 
what we fear. We seek out 
small fears, safe fears, 
fears that we can handle. 
Consider the roller coast- 
er: each new ride is pro- 
moled as the tallest, the 
fastest, the scariest ever 
constructed. 
In reality, the roller 
coaster is far less danger- 
ous than the drive to the 



amusement park. Our 
own cars should be far 
more frightening than 
any ride. Still, we drive in 
calm comfort and scream 
on the roller coaster. 

If we actually thought 
about how dangerous 
our lives are, we would 
never leave our beds. We 
invent little fears to keep 
ourselves from thinking 
about the things that can 
really hurt us. This Is the 
value of Halloween: ev- 
ery year, we drown our 



fears in a pool of imagi- 
nary monsters. We spend 
one day thinking about 
werewolves and demons 
instead of cancer and 
crime, one day worry- 
ing about alien Invasions 
and zombie attacks in- 
stead of fires and floods. 
We cloud our minds with 
phantoms so we can for- 
get about tlie real terrors 
that surround us. Often, 
this is the only way to 
handle the world ivithoul 
going mad. 



As strange as it sounds, 
today is the least fright- 
ening day of the year. 
Our ordinary lives are far 
more terrifying than any 
Halloween horror, so we 
use the holiday to take a 
day off from reality. The 
evils we experience today 
may be frightening, but 
they are small enough 
for us to defeat. There is 
always a lone survivor 
to stop the killer, always 
a magic spell to put the 
living dead back in their 



graves. The rest of the 
year, there is more evil in 
the world than any of us 
could ever hope to stop. 
When a honor movie 
ends, the monster is 
gone, at least until the se- 
quel. In reality, we never 
get a break. We are never 
safe. 

Still, let us forget the 
truth and enjoy HaUow- 
een while we can. Our 
day of fantasy is all too 
short, and the real fear 
will be back tomorrow.

Mike Relm; Awesome, Remixed 



By ZACHARY KORNBACK 

hornzfi01@ipfw.edu 



Mike Relm, a D] from 
San Francisco opened 
for the Blue Man 
Group last Thursday 
night, scratching vinyl 
and stealing hearts. 
His refreshing mixture 
of scratching music 
and scratching clips 
from movies and TV 
shows almost creates a 
new kind of art, a new 
kind of show - he has 
created visual music. 

Relm began his ca- 
reer at the age of 16 
when he bought his 
first set of turntables 
and a mixer and was 
introduced to scratch- 
ing by his brother. 
Years later he was very 
appropriately asked 
to tour with the Blue 
Man Group, who mix 
visual art with a more 
musical kind. 

The concept of vi- 
sual music is some- 
thing that Relm always 



wanted to do but 
for the longest time 
didn't believe was 
possible. He experi- 
mented with many 
differentways of pre- 
senting visuals with 
the music, includ- 
ing having someone 
synch the visuals 
backstage while he 
scratched the music 
on stage. Nothing 
seemed to work for 
him until one fateful 
day in Japan when 
Relm was looking at 
some CD scratching 
technology when he 
asked about scratch- 
ing movies and was 
shown one of the first 
few DVD turntables. 
He describes the mo- 
ment as surreal, a 
dream come true, 

"They took me to 
the back and they 
showed me the piece, 
like before it was like 
sold or whatever... 
and 1 was like, 'Oh 
niy God! What the 
hellV Are you serious? 



It was surreal - 1 was 
like, 'Wow, I can't be- 
lieve they did it!'" 
When Mike Relm was 
asked to join the Blue 
Man Group's Megastar 
tour, he was floored. 
"They actually found 
me on YouTUbe," he 
said in an interview 
last Thursday. "They 
called and I was like, 
that - that's not real. 
Blue Man Group? 
Wliat are they gonna 
call me for? They're 
on Arrested Develop- 
ment! But it was re- 
ally them and they 
saw one of my videos 
on YouTube and were 
looking for an open- 
er..." 

The rest is history. 

The wonderful thing 
about Mike Relm's 
music is that it's so ac- 
cessible to everyone 
- you don't have lo 
like Hip- Hop to enjoy 
his music. His seam- 
less integration of 
scratching clips from 
movies and television

1 5 Ways to Fight Freshman 1 5 

The "Freshman Fifteen" is a term used to describe the weight-gain of students when one experiences sleep deprivation, honnones that induce appetite in- 

during their freshman year of coUege. This weight-gain is often caused by creases while the hormones responsible for suppressing appedte decreases, 

binge drinking, stress, inactivity, and poor eating habits. The holiday In other words, the less sleep you get, the more food you eat. 

season is also approachirig. which means less phys- ^^^^^ ical ac- 7 Qq grOCerV Shopping OH a full StOmach. In doing 

tivity, more dnnking. and more food. Be- ^jum"''''^ \ lowisa ... ° . ^ . ^'^. °.. . .. ..." 




list with reasonable suggestions t 
with the Freshman Fifteen. 

1. Avoid binge 
drinking: Alcohol is one 
of the leading causes of 
weight-gain for college 

students. The American Jour- 
nal of Clinical Nutrition conducted a 
study where eight men were given two 
drinks of vodka and sugar-free lem- 
onade separated by 30-minute inter- 
vals, with each drink containing less 
than 90 calories. Fat metabolism 
was measured before and after the 
consumption of the drink. For 
several hours after drinking the 
vodka, whole body hpid oxida- 
tion, a measure used to deter- 
mine how much fat your body is 
burning, dropped by 73 percent. 
It is unreasonable to expect one 
to abstain from drinking for the 
sole purpose of weight man- 
agement, as it is considered by 
many to be a well-established 
coLege instiiudon. However, 
monitoring your alcohol intake 
can, be :i significant approach to 
avoiding unwanted weight gain. 

2. Exercise, This is 

somewhat obvious. For diose 
not involved in sports, the IPFW work- 
out facility is still available to students, 
as well as a number of fitness classes at 
affordable prices. Exercising has innu- 
merable benefits according to the Mayo 
Clinic, as it can assist in managing and los- 
ing weight, fortify your immune system, im- 
prove mood, promote better sleep, strength- 
en your heart and lungs, and can sometimes 
even be fun. 

3. Drink plenty of water. "You 

can never drink too much. Water is imperative 
for coUege students trying to stay healthy. Not 
only does it hydrate your body after those wild 
beer-guzzlingparties, but water is also a significant 
tool to your weight-loss intentions. Water flushes 
the unwanted elements out of your system while 
giving you the feeling of being 'full,' Thus, it can limit 
your binge desires immensely," personal trainer Mike 
Barber said. Avoid other types of liquid calories, such 
as soda, high-sugar juices, mochas, etc. 

4. Park far away from your classes 
and walk as often as you can. Fitting in 

"mini -workouts" throughout the day can help you avoid 
weight gain. It is also a good idea to invest in a pedom- 
eter to keep track of your number of steps. The recom- 
mended number of steps for weight management is ten 
thousand each day, according to shapeup.org. Just remem- 
ber that walking to and from class does not constitute an 
entire workout 

5. Don't skip breakfast. Eating breakfast can 
reduce hunger throughout the day, so one will be less suscepti 
ble to snack on unhealthy foods and make poor nutritional choic 
es for other meals of the day, according to webmd.com. 

6. Get plenty of sleep. According to sleep-deprivation.c 



so, you will not be tempted to grab anything and everything on the shelves. 
This could also save you a significant amount of money. 

8. Don't associate all social events with eating. 

Rather than go to Steak 'N Shake or Starbucks to catch up with friends, take 
a lap around the campus. Including friends in workouts can also serve as a 
good motivation tool. 

9. Eat smaller meals more often. This wiii ensure that 

yoiu" metabohsm keeps doing its job. 

10. Avoid mindless eating by chewing 

gum or brushing your teeth. Gum can help sat- 
isfy a sugar- craving, and brushing your teeth can also deter 
cravings because it makes sugary foods and drinks taste 
unpleasant. 

11. Be mindful of your portions, to 

avoid overeating, stack your plate first with fruits and 

vegetables, dien a smaller helping of starches. Add 

meat last, which should be about the size of a deck 

of cards. Using smaller dishes and utensils can also 

keep portion sizes down. 

12. Try to limit your intake of 

processed foods. The Food and Drug Ad- 
ministration {FDA) maintains a list of over 3,000 
chemicals that are added to the processed food 
iiipply. Many of these chemicals are not natu- 
fally occurring substances in the human body, so 
they can potentially damage the body's normal 
hincuons, including the metabolism. AlUiough 
processed foods tend to be less expensive than 
the namral kind, a student may be able to af- 
ford foods such as whole grain rice and pasta, 
frozen fruii and vegetables, nuls, water, and 
oatmeal. Tr^' to get a serving of each food 
group in every meal. 

13. Be aware of your re- 
lationship with food. College 
be stressful and an emotional roll- 
er-coaster and many people cope via 
food and beverages. Before making an 
unhealthy eating choice, ask yourself 
if you are stressed, sad, bored, etc., 
and think of an alternative means 
to alleviate your problems, wheth- 
er it be taking it out on a treadmill 
or calling a friend. 

14.Monitor your 
late-night calorie 

intake, in a 2005 study, 
food eaten beftveen 8 
p.m. and 4 a.m. was a- 
leading conu-ibutor to 
weight gain, accord- 
ing to kidshealth.org. If 
you have to be up late, 
eat healthy low-calorie 
foods. 

15. Don't get 
bored, do not stick 

to the same workout regi- 
men and eating habits. One 
ivill more than likely get bored 
and not adhere to the plan, or the body may be- 

too acclimated and a workout or diet will become 
futile. TVy to adapt habits that are simple and unresirictive 
tlial can be modified maintained in any lifestyle.

Former Mastodon Livinq the Dream In MLB 

IPFW Alumnus riding higli in we pros witli the Rocl&lt;ies 



IPFW Athletics 

As baseball Tans in the 
Fort Wayne area watcli 
this year's World Series, 
they may not know that 
one of their own is actu- 
ally a big part of the pic- 
ture. 

Zach Wilson, a 2000 
graduate of IPFW, is the 
Manager of Scouting 
for the National League 
Champion Colorado 
Rockies. 

Wilson was a member 
of ciirrent head coach 
Billy Gernon's first leam 
at IPFW. As a second 
baseman, Wilson hit .290 
for the Mastodons in the 
Great Lakes Valley Con- 
ference when ii was still 
a wood bat league. 

Today, however, Wil- 
son's no longer facing 
balls and strikes, but 




ROCME§ 



the challenge of putting 
together a talent pool 
to win championships. 
Something he has ac- 
complished this year. 

"This season has been 
beyond aniihing you 
can dream of, and it has 
really not set in yet," the 
former 'Don said, 

"'We have put in so 
much work, and with 
a never rest attitude, 



hopefully in November 
it will all set in. It was 
just an unbelievable 
experience being on 
the field as the Rockies 
organt2ation was being 
handed the National 
League Championship 
trophy." 

Coach Gernon is not 
surprised at all by how 
quickly Wilson has ris- 
en through the organi- 



zation's ranks. 
Wilson started 
his career with 
the Rockies In 
an entry level 
ticket sales po- 
sition. 

"Hewasavery 
gritty player," 
Gernon said. 

"His com- 
petitive desire 
was very solid 
and he was a 
very coachable 
^^^" player. Zach 
was always a 
"big team, litde 
me" type of guy which 
made it impossible not 
to thoroughly enjoy be- 
ing his coach." 

An outstanding stu- 
dent as well, Wilson was 
given the Doc Skehon 
award for academic and 
athletic achievement 
during his playing days. 
"1 am fortunate to 
have been a part of 



IPFW, where I was able 
to excel athletically and 
also gained an outstand- 
ing education," Wilson 
added. 

"I would not be where I 
am today without the ex- 
periences I took from at- 
tending IPFW and being 
apartofits baseball pro- 
gram. Playing for Coach 
Gernon was a tremen- 
dous experience. I have 
met very few people in 
the game who have the 
same amount of passion 
and love for the game of 
baseball." 

So from his luxury 
office in Coors Field, 
Wilson watched as the
