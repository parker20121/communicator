Land control 

Local governments in the United States of America began assuming planning 
and zoning powers late in the 19th century. In the interests of seeing their 
towns and cities develop in an orderly way, property owners by and large 
have accepted this intrusion into their traditional rights to use a piece of 
land for whatever purpose they chose. We are reaching a point, however, 
where land use controls are spinning a web around property rights in a way 
that surely would have appalled our grandfathers. 

City and county governments are yielding to pressure to surrender their 
planning and zoning powers to regional bodies. Many states, California among 
them, have placed the control of development of at least part of their land 
in the hands of state agencies. Predictable, the federal government is next. 
Legislation is moving through the 93rd Congress that will make the quef 
of what happens to the vacant lot at the end of our block an it 

The proposed Land Use Policy and Planning Assistance , 
bipartisan support, ahs the innocent outlines of a progressive piece of environ- 
mental legislation, with the customary price tag of federal funds. It would 
distribute $100 million a year to state governments to encourage them to 
adopt statewide land use policies and see that they are enforced. With that 
kind of empetus for distant, centralized planning and zoning authority, the 
historic local responsibility in the field appears doomed, not to mention what 
might remain of the rights of the individual property owner. 

This might be the time for citizens to draw back and consider how far they 
want to go in creating government agencies to hold sway over the use of 
land. What exactly is the deed to a piece of property going to mean when 
there is an environmental policeman on every corner, possibly in a federal 
uniform? The question is as much a philosophic one as a political one, 

The environmentalists argue that land can no longer be considered as only 
a commodity to be bought, sold and used freely within the framework of a 
community plan. It must be "managed" in the public interest, the way we

led the Green Bay Packers to six divisional 
titles and two Super Bowl victories, died of
