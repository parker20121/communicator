GUEST COLUMNIST 



EDITORIALS 

Campus police needed 

Many students seem to complain endlessly about the presence of campus 
police. Some are downright hostile to having any kind of security force at all. 

Sure, the campus police seem to have nothing belter to do than give tickets to 
those cars that arc illegally parked and harass people who want to carry a six-pack 
into the Film Series showings Unfortunately for some, the people who make the 
rules around here have ordered the police to do just that. 

What is not quick to come to mind is how valuable their mere presence on 
campus is to the protection of the facilities. IPFW has a physical plant of better 
than (20,000,000. That kind of investment demands around-the-clock protection, 
something it is not now getting. 

It will probably take a major incident of vandalism or theft to wake up the 
administration to this urgent need. That is what is really unfortunate.

depressing. 

Granted, a lot of students work and Sunday night is not the most opportune 
time for entertainment, and soccer is not the national pasttime. But the soccer 
team is beginning to play some of the nation's largest universities and desperately 
needs support to make the program one IPFW can be proud of. 

Who knows Soccer could be the pioneer sport that finally generates some 
intercollegiate school spirit.
