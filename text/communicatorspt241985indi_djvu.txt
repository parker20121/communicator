Agreement prompts resolution 



By MICHELE SHAFFER 
Managing Editor 

The recent controversy concerning the formal Agreement on Reporting to a 
Single President i ARSP) prompted Arts and Letters faculty members to meet and 
construct a resolution to keep Indiana University programs intact at IPFW. 

"They wanted to specify and expand on this agreement , this matter of 
reporting to one president," said Julius Smulkstys, dean of Arts and l-etters, ex- 
plaining why the faculty constructed the resolution. 

The purpose of the resolution, introduced at the meeting of 42 arts and letters 
faculty members, is lo "make the agreement more specific and to say nothing will 
change," said Smulkstys, 

The resolution specifies certain matters the aereement does not," added 
Smulkstys 

"As long as Indiana University -Purdue University at Fort Wayne (IPFW) 
remains a component of the state-wide university system, it shall continue to 
operate as a joint campus of Indiana University and Purdue University, func- 
tioning as equal partners in their endeavors to provide Northeastern Indiana with 
quality higher education." states item one of the proposal. 

Other Items in the resolution further this idea of maintaining Indiana Univer- 
sity's status at IPFW. Items two and three state all Indiana University programs 
andpersonnel will continue lo have the same status and privileges granted to them 
prior to the ARSP 

The resolution states the Chancellor, as well as the Vice Chancellor, Dean of 
Faculty, Vice Chancellor of Financial Affairs and the Dean of Students, will 



continue to represent Indiana programs. Further, item seven provides the "budget 
of IPFW shall be approved by the Presidents of Indiana Universily and Purdue 
University " 

All of the nine items on the resolution aim at preventing erosion of Indiana 
programs, Smulkstys said. Item nine, in particular, provides that an Indiana 
University administrator will be appointed lo the IPFW campus lo oversee 
Indiana University programs. 

'"They (Arts and Letters tacultyi were afraid," said Smulkstys, "that this 
agreement may eventually lead to the Indianapolis arrangement . . except here 
Purdue would be the host and Indiana the guest," 

Smulkstys said the agreement for the two present presidents (John Ryan of 
Indiana and Steven Beeringof Purduel is fine- 
However, beyond them ithe two presidents), no specifications were made. The 
resolution spelts out these specifications in writing for future presidents, said 
Smulkstys. 

Smulkstys said the resolution will be proposed to the Indiana University 
Trustees at their October meeting for the trustees to approve it and have it In- 
cluded in the formal written agreement. 

When asked if he fell the decision of reporting to one president only was more 
than a "cosmetic" change, as Ryan called it, Smulkstys said the decision has Ihe 
capability of ushering in more change. 

"The agreement, being fairly short, has the potential of being just a cosmetic 
change or more than that ,., That's why Arts and Letters felt they needed more 
specifications in the form of a resolution," said Smulkstys.

Loraine 
plans ahead 
for alumni 

By DEBORAH A, 5TARKS 
Chief Reporter 

To see the Indiana University 
Alumni Association and the Purdue 
Alumni Association at Fort Wayne 
t&gt;ecome one organization is the dream 
of Tom Loraine, president of the 
Purdue Alumni Association at IPF^. 

"I see the day of the Indiana-Purdue 
Universities Alumni Association at 
Fort Wayne rather than two separate 
bodies," said Loraine, 

"(Both) alumni arepresentlypart of 
the larger societies at Indiana 
University, Bloomington, and Purdue 
University, West L.afayette," said 
Vivian Lansky, Alumni Director at 
IPFW. 

"The two associations at IPFW work 
very close together to provide services 
for our members," said Loraine. 

Loraine became an active member 
of the alumni association while a 
student at IPFW and fire chief of the 
city of Fort Wayne. He is a 1982 
graduate of IPFW and is presently 
employed at Fire Systems, Inc. 

Since becoming affiliated with the 
Purdue Alumni Association at IPFW, 
Loraine has served as vice president, 
secretary and treasurer, 

"The true definition of alumni is a 
person who has attended a univer- 
sity," said Loraine "Our goal is to try 
and get people who are presently 
enrolled at IPFW involved in the 
alumni association. We are looking for 
people who support the university," 
said Loraine, 

"Another goal of the Purdue Alumni 
Association is to assist the Athletic 
Department in increasing its 
scholarship potential "Sports will 
play an important role in the higher 
level of American Education." said 
Loraine 

The two alumni associations have 
planned several activities for 19S5-B6. 
including a joint bus trip to the Indiana 
versus Purdue football game In 
Bloomington. 

Although Loraine's term as 
president expires In May, 1986, he 
plans to remain an active member of 
the association, 

"I see IPFW becoming a major 
institution in a few years. Maybe that's 
another part of my dream for the 
future. I want to have a part in thai 
dream," said Loraine, 

If you are Interested in joining either 
the Indiana University Alumni 
Association or the Purdue Alumni 
Association at Fort Wayne, contact 
Vivian Lansky, Alumni Director.

reluctant 

building since traditionally il has been 

astale obligation." 

Last spring, the Indiana State 
Legislature said it would provide the 
bonding authority for 2.25 million 
dollars, one-half Ihe cost, if the Fori 
Wayne community would pay for the 
other one-half. 

"We took their challenge seriously 
andspentthe summer with a x-aricty of 
individuals and organizations," 
Carnaghi said. 

While he was close to obtaining funds 
several times this summer, Carnaghi 
was not close enough. "We had several 
individuals who were willing to 
provide money if others matched their 
donation, but there we have no outright 
gifts," Carnaghi said, 

"We had one unsolicited offer to 
assist in funding the tine arts building, 
but he withdrew his offer when he 
decided to relocate m another part of 



thecounlry," Carnaghi said, 

"We want to be able to tell the 
legislature we have overturned every 
stone in our search tor matching 
funds," Carna^i said. 

Who will approach the state 
legislature with our need and When nas 
yet lo be determined. "There are no 
definite plans as to who will present 
our request," said Edward Nicholson, 
acting Chancellor, "but we wilt make 
an effort to present our needs," It may 
not be possible to amend the budget 
during this session of Ihe legislature, 
but after two meetings has sent the 
resolution back lo committee. 

The Student Senate, at its meel ing on 
Sept II, resolved to "strongly support 
requesting from Ihe state legislature 
tin this year's session) an additional 
2.25 million dollars for an on campus 
tine arts building,.," 

David McGee, chairman of the fine 
arts department, feels il is up to 




President Beering, as chief operating 
officer, to carry our request to the 

legislature.

Sandra A. Flum, another senator, 
submitted a resolution asking Ihe 
legislature to provide 2,25 million 
dollars during the next session for a 



fine arts building on campus. The 
Student Senate felt a fine arts building 
on campus would greatly improve the 
collegiate atmosphere and that a new 
building downtown would continue to 
have many of the problems students 
currently face. 

Senator Gina Kostotf submitted a 
resolution calling for the improvement

■■.Sept. 26, 1985 



Beering, let us tell 
you about IPFW 



Steven Beering, president of Purdue 
University, has (his great idea to be the 
■'sole boss" for the chancellor of Indiana 
University-Purdue University at Fort 
Wayne. 

However, Beering continually refers 
to the university in error. Beering seems 
to think that our university is called 
"lUPUFW." We would like to sincerely 
ask Beering that if he is going to run the 
show, in a sense, here in Fort Wayne that 
he learn the proper name for our 
university. 

President Beering, sir, we are called 
IPFW, short for Indiana-Purdue. Fort 
Wayne, NOT lUPUFW. 

As long as we've got your attention, we 
would like to once again urge you to 
reconsider your proposition about to 
whom our chancellor would report. 

You keep telling us that this wonderful 
Purdue takeover will not affect the 
community, John Hicks, your senior 
vice president, told us he didn't see what 
the big deal was because it won't 
directly affect the students, the 
university or the community. 

That is double talk. Any change so 
basic as this management decision will 
affect us .,. directly. Do not tell us it is 
none of our business either. Our tax 



dollars and tuition help to pay your 
salaries and fund this university. 

We have a right to know exacUy what 
is going on. 

President Beering, this is more than a 
cosmetic change .. we all know that. 
This is a major, basic change. This 
change will affect where all the money 
goes, and it will affect the future success 
of this campus. 

Perhaps such a major change needs to 
be discussed more. The administration 
might consider extending this decision 
for another year to foster more 
discussion about this management 
decision. 

When other governing bodies, such as 
the United States Congress cannot 
decide on important issues, they remand 
the proposal until the next session. 

We know you are getting tired of 
hearing this same speech each week. 
But we are tired of the "academic 
balderdash," as The Journal-Gazette 
called it recently. 

Nicholson has been heard to say that 
when the press tires of this, it will die 
out. 

Let us tell you right here and now — 
we will not let this blow over. We can 
wait it out as long as' you. 



We're not 'just the 
student's newspaper' 



It is an issue which has drawn 
attention many times over the years. It 
is mentioned in the amendments to the 
Constitution of the United States. People 
can go to jail over it. Movies have been 
based on it, What is it that commands all 
this attention? 

The rights of the press. 

Although The Communicator is not the 
Journal Gazette or the News Sentinel, 
we still have the obligation to inform 
students on this campus of Uie issues of 
concern to them — like chancellor 
replacement, the fine arts building, and 
Students Government, not issues like 
trade embargoes with Japan or arms 
talks with the Soviets. 

Yes. we're "only" a campus paper, 
but when issues have important 
influence on students of IPFW, then 
these issues need to be presented to the 
students — in The Communicator No 
one should have the right to monitor and 
control what is published. 
Communicator reporters should be 
factual, with reliable sources — not 
robots programmed by certain elite 
officials to write their propaganda. 



This IS The Communicator. It is our 
job to communicate with students. As 
with any newspaper, we have the 
Constitutional right to present the news, 
not to avoid so-called "touchy" subjects. 
Cliche or not, the people do have a right 
to know. You have a right to know. 

When a new chancellor is chosen for 
IPFW, the students will be directly 
affected by the choice The 
Communicator has the responsibility to 
inform you of any changes that may 
result from the appointment. Fine arts 
students are involved with the creation 
of a new fine arts facility. These 
students, as readers of The 
Communicator, need to read what is 
going on in the development of a new 
building. 

Regulation of the press was important 
enough to be included in the U,S. 
Constitution. It is important to every 
citizen and important to every student at 
IPFW. The Communicator will continue 
to present the facts with every edition, to 
communicate with ynu the reader, what 
you should know, and to report the news 
in a clear, informed manner.

Now everyone's getting involved in politics 



Jock PAC 
formed 

The National Football 
League is considering for- 
ming its own political action 
committee. Just what we 
need — jock lobbyists 
practicing broken field in- 
fluence peddling. 

Someday they can build 
the NFL Lobbyists Hall of 
Fame. They can show films 
of the immortal NFL- 
financed political banquets 
of the century. 

I ask you, what red- 
blooded young lad doesn't 
aspire to one day carry the 
money down the field to the 
roar of the crowd in a big 
league congressional cam- 
paign? 

And then to go for the extra 
point — a government job tor 
a relative. 

Explicit lyrics? 
No biggy! 

Parents' organizalions are 
leading a movement to put 
warning labels on record 
albums, cautioning about the 
explicit lyrics. They've got it 
all wrong - the labels should 




warn about the music. 

Given the choice I'd pick 
the raunchy lyrics over the 
melal-on-metal tones of a 
quadriphonic train wreck. 

Come to think of it, the 
music drowns out the lyrics 
anyway, so what's all the 
excitement about? 

A warning label is one 
thing. But what about the 
music on the radio? The disc 
jockey would have to say — 
"Radios off, boys and girls. 
This next tune contains a 
word you've known since you 
wcresix." 

Ball stars 
getting 'hits' 

Which baseball statistics 
are wo to believe anymore"" 



Do they record the feats of 
the drug users or the non- 
drug users on the field? Will 
the officials have to keep two 
setsoftwoks? 

Is the yardage gamed by a 
particular football star a 
valid statistic if that player 
goes half a season without 
blinking? 

What sport is still clean? 
Chess? How many cribbage 
players are "doing- 
steroids? 

What's the difference 
between playacting at a 
sport and messing with your 
central nervous system? As 
of 1905 Major League 
Baseball is officially the new 
wrestling. 



Politicians are 
good people 

Sens. Gary Hart and 
William Cohen complain in 
TV Guide that senators are 
too often portrayed on 
television as being corrupt 
and power-driven. Gen- 
tlemen, thai will change 
when "Face the Nation" 
beats "Dynasty" in tlie 
ratings. 

It's safe to say that 
stereotypes will disappear 
when a fundamentalist 
preacher pops up on the lube 
speaking with a New York 
accent. 

Or a Mafia godfather is 
played by Robert Bedford 

The image of, the 
Presidency is still very 
positive and that's im- 
portant. You just never hear 
a little kid say he wants to 
grow up to be ranking 
minority memtwr of the 
House Ways and Means 
Oommittee. 



Spies 
Wanted 



Britain expelled 2S Soviet 
spies and the Soviets ex- 
pelled 25 British spies. The 50 
unemployed spies headed for 
West Germany where the 
work is. 

Then Britain kicked out six 
more Russian spies, which 
now leaves them with a 
shortage. 

Great Britain cannot allow 
this to happen. Any country 
with no spies operating 
within its borders is a small . 
potatoes country indeed. 

They'llhave toplaeeanad 
in the Spies Wanted section 
of Pravda. 

In this country instead of 
deporting the accused spies, 
we jusi cut off their Navy 
pensions.

IPFW increases services for disabled students 



By CAROL KOENIC 
Staff Writer 

You can roll right in to 
Kettler Hall In room 206 of 
the Miiltipurpose Building, 
there are calculators and 
clocks that will speak to you. 
Due to facilities like these, 
the number of disabled 
students at IPFW has 
greatly increased since last 
year. 

According lo Barbara 
Johnson, coordinator of 
Disabled Student Services, 
this growth is a result of the 
services offered to han- 



dicapped students John- 
son, who started work as 
coordinator on July 1, said 
there are 190 to 200 disabled 
students on campus this 
year, al least 40 more than 
last year. 

As coordinator, Johnson 
serves as liaison between 
instructors and students. She 
feels it is important to make 
sure teachers and 
administration are aware of 
disabled students. Before 
classes start, she sends 
letters to professors giving a 
" ■ ' overview of the 






disability of a student who 
will be in class. This opens 
lines of communication and 
may erase any (ear on the 
instructor's part. It also 
takes the guesswork out of 
dealing with a student's 
disability. 

Johnson speaks en- 
thusiastically of the 
cooperation she has received 
from administration and 
professors. "There has been 
a great response to all the 
needs of the disabled 
students 1 am pleased at the 
showTi by faculty 



and staff in working together 
to accommodate students." 
she said. 

A study room located in 
room 2C7 of the Multipurpose 
Building, has specialized 
equipment lo help the 
students compensate for 
their disability. It's a small 
room, often crowded with 
students using the large 
print typewriter or an Apple 
11 computer with speech 
synthesizer. There are 
devices to enlarge print and 
magnify sound, talking 
dictionaries, and calculators 



and clocks which can 
provide information ver- 
bally All of these receive 
daily student use. 

The Disabled Students 
Services office maintains a 
list of people who will work 
as readers, note-takers, 
interpreters and attendants. 
The office also helps 
students to arrange any 
special accommodations 
they may need with exams 
or other aspects of 
classroom work. 

The disabled students are 
represented by the Council 



tor the Recognition of 
Disabled Students. The 
president, Dawn Roberts, a 
visually impaired student, 
says IPnv does "pretty 
good" in providing services 
and accessibility for han- 
dicapped students. The 
council has been in- 
strumental in initiating 
needed changes on campus 
over the last few years. 
According lo Roberts, they 
provide some of the best 
services for disabled 
students in the stale.

The IPFW Placement 

Office is successfully 
bringing together students 
and potential employers. 
Prom July 1, 1984. to May 1. 
1985. 181 IPF^ graduates 
have notified the placement 
office of their employment 
according to the office's 
annual report. Thirty of 
these jobs were obtained as a 
result of on-campus in- 
lerviews. 

The placement office 
strives to bring a variety of 
companies to campus and 
encourages students lo 
prepare for and have in- 
terviews which may lead to 
their first job. During the 
19M-85 school year, 102 
companies representing 
business. industry and 
education, and 19 health 
related agencies conducted 
interviews on campus. 

The placement office 
provides a variety of ser- 
vices lo IPFW sludents 
ranging from on-campus 
recruiting and job postings 
from local, state and 
national companies, to 
simply being there as a 
sounding board after an 
interview. "The people who 
use the service are pleased," 



says Linda Scott, coor- 
dinator of Placement Ser- 
vices "Mosl people feel they 
gel personal attention." 

Workshops in resume- 
writing and interview 
techniques are offered to 
teach students to market 
themselves wisely Scoll 
says that the recruiters can 
see a difference in the 
candidates who have had 
exposure lo the skills of 
selling themselves. Also 
offered this fall is a 
workshop titled "Straight 
Talk — The Employer's 
Perspective on Finding a 
Job, " which will feature a 
panel of IPF'W alumni of- 
fering career search 
strategies, and a seminar on 
dressing for interviews. 

The placement office has 
expanded its employer 
literature files, as a result of 
a request lo over 500 em- 
ployees for information on 
their companies. The files 
can aid IPFW students by 
providing background in- 
formation which may give 
the student an added edge 
when applying for a job 
Another change this fall will 
be increased amounts of 
resume referrals. Resumes 
provided to the placement 
office by prospective IPFW 



graduates will be mailed to 
companies who have posted 
a job opening for which the 



student is qualified. 

The placement office 
cannot guarantee a job for 



every studenl, but they hope 
lo aid in the search. For 
more information the 



placement office is located 
in Walb Memorial Union, 
room 113,

GREVEN 

Features Editor 

The first sentence of the 
Indiana-Purdue Com- 
munications C!ub hand-out 
states that it's "...a working 
club dedicated to giving 
IPFW students a chance to 
gain practical experience in 
the field of com- 
munications," 

Holly Lowe, president of 
the IPCC and IPFW 
student, stresses, "you don't 
have to be a communications 
major to participate. I'd like 
to see a more diverse group 
of students active in the 
IPCC," 

Meetings are held every 
Monday (when classes are in 
sessioni at noon in the 
basement of Helmke 
Library. Students are 
welcome to bring a lunch to 
842 

Lowe calls the basement of 



the library home. In addition 
to meeting rooms, the IPCC 
has access lo a studio, 
audio-video editing rooms, 
sound boards-tx)oths, and a 
dark room for processing 
film. 

The learning resource 
center is a good source for 
graphics materials as well 
as technical advice from the 
department's inhabitants. 

"I like to think of the IPCC 
as a clearing house of dif- 
ferent talents," Lowe said. 
"The average attendance at 
meetings this semester has 
been 17 students, who excel 
in the areas of radio. TV and 
film as well as interpersonal 
communications." 

Cable Channel 32, based on 
the campus, will soon begin 
to air "OuLline," a magazine 
forp.at show, Lowe hopes 
that students will become 
involved in evefy J[^ase of 
the show's production. 



Students interested in 
working on "Outline" should 
submit an application to 
Angie Scofield. program 
director of channel 23. Her 
office is also in the basement 
of the library. 

"When I first met Angie 
(Scofieldi, it was a godsend 
because she's very willing to 
work with the students as a 
way for us to learn, ' Lowe 
explained. 

Another project Lowe is 
working on is the proposed 
'Riverside Theatre" 
program. She'd like to see 
student written. acted, 
filmed and produced shows 
to be aired on channel 23. 
The title was chosen by 
Lowe, vice-president Amy 
Lambert and secretary- 
treasurer Gwen Auld 
because of IPFW's 
geographical location. 
"We're working to make this 
our I IPFW student's) 
sUtion," Lowe said, "so we 
came up with this title to tie 
it in with the campus, since it 
runs along the river," 

If she has anything to say 
about it, a new radio station 
will soon be broadcast from 
campus. (Doesn't this 
woman ever sleep?) Lowe 
has presented her idea lo the 



IPCC advisor, Ed Griffiths, 
who is "in support of us," 
and lo Dr David McCants. 
chair of the communications 
and theatre department who 
thinks it's a "fairly good 

Last semester, she polled 
students to see what kind of 
music they wanted to hear 
and what time of the day 
they wanted to hear it. 
Hopefully, the results of her 
survey will he heard over the 
airwaves on WIPC (the 
tentative call letters). 

Students who join creative 
forces with the IPCC may 
look forward to contributing 
to all programs mentioned; 
WrPC, "Riverside Theatre," 
and "Outline' plus guest 
speakers and equipment 
demonstrations during the 
weekly meetings 

"1 think that these guest 
speakers, who are all 
working in the media can 
give us an edge," she said, 
"since they can tell us how to 
get started and then go 
places in this field." 

When speaking about 
radio, Lowe's eyes glitter 
and those already animated 
features race lo keep up with 
her hands. The phrase. "It 
you lied her hands behind 



her back she wouldn't be 
able to speak," was written 
about Lowe. 

"The IPCC is going lo 
work, this lime," she states, 
"with Ihe emphasis shifted 
from the video aspect most 
mass communication 
classes cover, lo an In- 
volvement in radio Lowe 
reasoned thai this is 
nee e ssa ry beca use "radio 
will never diet" 

"One thing you still cannot 
do is drive and watch TV," 
she pointed out. "Just 
because the current em- 
phasis is on the picture, 
doesn't lessen radio's impact 
on society — because radio 
makes your mind workl " 

Lowe hopes that by 
working with the IPCC. 
students will come away 
with a more well-rounded 
sense of mass com- 
munication by participating 
in the various programs 
available. 

"It you really want lo 
learn, and you're willing lo 
work to learn, join us. It's a 
hell of a lot easier lo get a 
job, when you have some 
experience first!" 



Tobacco Road' opens 



By SEBASTIAN CHAPMAN 
Slaff Writer 

"Tobacco Road," the first 
Indiana-Purdue Theatre 
production of the 1985-86 
season, will open Oct. 11 
under the direction of Larry 
Life, assistant professor of 
theatre. 

The 1933 play by Jack 
Kirkland, was adapted from 
the Erskine Caldwell novel. 
Tobacco Road, which was 
considered very con- 
troversial and sexually 
explicit for its time. The cast 
consists of five women and 
six men who portray 
characters whose ages 
range from the mid-teens to 
the late 60s. 

Life suggests the play 
directly relates to problems 
farmers are having in the 



19B0S "Half of America is 
starving and these people 
haven't necessarily been 
poor all of their lives. The 
play shows you that anyone 
can become impoverished al 
any time and what little 
control you would have over 
your life or anything else." 
said Life. 

The play explores the lives 
of people who live on a rural 
dirt road in the back country 
of Georgia during the 
Depression Its central 
family, the Lesters, have 
been physically, 

emotionally, and spiritually 
crippled by ignorance, 
poverly, malnutrition and 
superstition Violence and 
hunger are never far from 
the door of the crumbling 



shack they call home. Still, 
the Lesters stubbornly cling 
to their worked-outland, as a 
token of their dignity, and 
try to find some small 
measure of happiness and 
freedom from despair 

Although the Lesters all 
live together, their family 
unity has been destroyed. 
They act as though they're 
totally independent from 
each other and they begin to 
develop self-centered at- 
titudes, pressing their 
situation even more, 

"Tobacco Road" is a very 
sad but humorous play that 
leaves everyone who views it 
witha different opinion.

Early photographs at the Art Museum ^|it' 



From September I3 to 
October 27 the Fori Wayne 
Museum of Art will present 
Culture and Record: I9lh 
Century PholoKraphy. 
Organized by the University 
of New Mexico Art Museum 
(rem its internationally 
known holdings, the 
exhibition consists of 126 
photographs surveying a 
broad range of subjects and 



techniques. 

From the moment of ils 
birth, photography was 
heralded as a rich addition to 
artistic tradition and 
recognized for its con- 
siderable economic potential 
as a desirable link to the 
industrial revolution. Not 
only did photography 
provide a means of mex- 
pensive portraiture for the 



burgeoning middle classes. 
but it revolutionized com- 
munications, from ad- 
vertising and marketing to 
current events. 

One of the earliest works 
in the exhibition is an 1845 
calotype by William Henry 
Fox Talbot, whose in- 
vesligalions into the

materials tiegan in 1834 
when he sought to capture 
permanently the image 
produced by the camera 
gbscura Ian optical device 
used by artists to aid in 
rendering a scene ac- 
curately,) The process he 
discovered was of great 
consequence to the eventual 
commercialization of the 
photographic image Unlike 
the daguerreotype unvented 
almost simultaneously), 
which produced a unique 
image on a silver coated 
copperplate, Talbot's 
process produced a positive 
and a negative enabling him 
to make in theory unlimited 
positive prints from a single 
paper negative. Numerous 
improvements and 

variations on this process 
were made, which is the 
earliest forerunner of 
today's black-and-white 
photograph. 

Many of the works in the 
exhibition document 
changing views of urban 
environments, exotic land- 
scapes, native cultures and 
well known personalities. 
Julia Margaret Cameron, 
, considered to be the first 
artist of the camera, enlisted 
her friends and neightiors, 
such as Alfred Lord Ten- 
nyson and Charles Darwin, 
as subjects for portraits, 
biblical scenes and literary 
tableaux, 

While the influence ot 
photography on painting is 
often noted, the inverse — 
painting's influence on 
photography of the 19th 
century — is also significant, 
Oscar Rejiander and Henry 
Peach Robinson, for 
example, emulated the 



ideals of Victorian painting 
by creating elalrarately 
staged allegorical and 
anecdotal scenes. The ar- 
tificiality of these tableaux 
was heightened by their use 
ot painted backdrops, 
assiduously posed models 
and the combination ot as 
many as 30 separate 
negatives in a single image. 

In contrast to this ap- 
proach the most recent 
works in the exhibition from 
around the turn ot the 
century represent a shift in 
aeshetic concerns. The work 
ofAlfredStieglitzandJ.E.A. 
Alget straddles the two 
centuries and, with their 
more naturalistic approach 
to urban landscape and 
genry, they predict 201 h 
century concerns. Both of 
these masters of the history 
of photography have been 
the subject of several recent 
major exhibitions. While 
Atgefs poetic views of 
Parisian streets were 
neglected and unknown for 
many years after his death, 
Stieglilz's accomplishments 
as a photographer, as the 
publisher of Camera Work 
and as a gallery owner who 
promoted progressive 
American artists were well 
known. 



As the 






photography recedes in 
time, the enormous cultural 
changes that the invention 
brought with it become 
fainter, impairing our un- 
derstanding of its 
magnitude. One of the most 
significant innovations of the 
century was on-the-spot war 
photography. In 1855 Roger 
Fenton took a wagon fitted 
out as a darkroom to

Peterson devotes time and energy to coaching 



By JENNY BLAKELY 
Starr Wrller 

Dedication. This word 
carries a lot ot weight in any 
endeavor, whether it's one's 
job. schoolwork, or athletic 
activity. In coaching, for 
example, one must have 
infinite patience, strong 
ijedication, and lots of time 
lo help alliletes on their way 
to victory. Barrie Peterson, 
tJie cross country coach at 
IPFW, knows and applies the 
word dedication to his work 
with the team. 

A small sample of his 
dedication to the cross 
country team occurred in the 
Hokum-Karem. which was 
hosted by IPFW Sept 7. 
Although the starting time 
for the meet was set al 10 
a.m., Peterson arrived at an 
early 6 a.m. to set up flags 
and the finish chute for the 
meet, as well as complete 
other last-minute details. 

According to Peterson, 



dedication is a major at- 
tribute among the people he 
works with, "I don't think 
tiiere's a better group of 
people to work with ( coaches 
and athletes)," Peterson 
slates, listing working with 
the people as a great ad- 
vantage to coaching. "They 
are very dedicated; they 
have Iheir goals in sports 
set." 

"I enjoy Ihe challenge," 
Peterson adds as yet another 
benefit in coaching. "I also 
enjoy seeing the other 
college campuses while 
traveling with the team." 

Peterson has been in- 
volved in coaching cross 
country for 15 years. After 
spending 13 years at Nor- 
throp High School, Peterson 
applied for and received the 
job al IPFW two year^ ago. 
Peterson explains Northrop 
was his first opportunity in 
coaching, and there wasn't 
anything to particularly 



"spark" his interest, "I've 
grown to love cross coun- 
try," Peterson states. 
"There are some pretty neat 
people involved." 

Obviously, there are 
numerous differences bet- 
ween high school and college 
cross coiintry. The time 
scheduling in college can 
provide a problem not 
present in high school. 
Peterson explains, "There is 
no complete control over the 
athletes' practice time (For 
example), you don't deal 
wilh jobs as much in high 

school as in college. But 
they've handled that pretty 
well." Peterson adds, "The 
studies are tougher and 
more demanding, which 
requires more time than in 
high school. The athletes 
have to be more dedicated at 
planning their time, and 
eliminate some things (extra 
activities)." 



The differences between 
high school and college 
coaching go further. 
Peterson continues, "In high 
school, there is a constant 
communication among the 
athletes and coaches, they 
are closer In college, it's 
tougher. But I was 
pleasantly surprised at the 
close relationship in 
college." 

Motivation is the correct 
way to achieve success, and 
Peterson lists several ways 
to give athletes a necessary 
"boost to achievement. 
"You have to communicate 
as much as possible with the 
runners, and find positive 
things in sometimes 
negative circumstances. 

Also, the athletes set their 
individual goals. This makes 
it easier i to motivate) than it 
would be for a lot of athletes 
lin different sports). There 
are not as many rewards. 



and not a lot of notoriety. But 
the reward is personal 
satisfaction. They know 
what it takes to win," 
Peterson says. 

Peterson coached the 
Mastodons to a ninth place 
finish at Taylor last 
Saturday. Some positive 
outcomes of the meet are 
their victories over Marion, 
as well as Huntington, a 
learn which had defeated 
IPFW at Grace the previous 
week. 

In the men's competition, 
Tom Hoffman finished 33rd 
out of 120 runners, wilh a 
time of 28:-1S, doing "really 
well" according to Peterson, 
adding Todd Eagen, 
finishing in 73rd place, ran 
his best race of the year. 
"Rich Jereb ran as well, 
according lo his goal, as 
anyone," placmg 78th. Other 
Mastodon finishers include 
Doug Sawyer, in 50th place. 



and Mark Kuhn, who placed 
B2nd. Steve McNulty. who 
incurred a hip injury a few 
weeks ago, will be out tor 
another week, hopefully 
returning for the meet al 
Manchester this Saturday. 
Peterson says his condition 
is improving, and when 
running, could easily be the 
team's third or fourth 
r tinner. 

[n the women's race, 
Kristi Walker finished third, 
with a SO: 14, and Carol Van 
Horn earned 20th place, 
clocking in at 22:49. "Both 
did an excellent job," ac- 
cording to Peterson. 

Peterson sums up. "It was 
a very tough course, and ( Ihe 
runners" times) were nol 
indicative of their true ef- 
forts. 

"We were a notch below 
what we could have been, but 
wp did better than last week. 
There was some im- 
provement."

but split the week with one 
win and one loss.
