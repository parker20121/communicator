Sandra Ellison, coordinator of special 
counseling services, has been ad- 
dressing the needs of minority students 
by visiting high schools and middle 
schools in Ihe Fort Wayne area. 
Speaking on the issue of women and 
minorities. Ellison always receives 
positive response. 

In order to belter inform these 
students. IPFW will conducl summer 
awareness workshops for freshmen and 
sophomores In high school. The student 
can then adjust his course of study in 
anticipation of a career In technology. 

Individual departments are also 
expanding Ihclr recruiting efforts. The 
department of engineering hopes to 
obtain sufficient funding to enable It to 
offer a Pre- Freshman Engineering

educational opportunities available to 
women and minority members In the

The engineering program at IPFW 
has a female enrollment of B percent. 
Data was not available, but the number 
of minority students is also estimated to 
below. 

"We are in the process of developing

Winning is not easy 



he (Eommunicator 



Championships ^re often hard lo come 
by in the world of sports. Ask any Tan of 
any Chicago team. 

No varisly team from IPFW has ever 
won a championship of major propor- 
tions. But then IPFW has onJy been 
taking sports seriously for the past few 

This morning, the soccer team is at- 
tempting to become the first IPFW 
squad lo win a championship in the 
Great Lakes Valley Conference. While a 
GLVC championship wouldn't be con- 
sidered a major victory by the national 
press, it would be a signal to the Fort 
Wayne community and to the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association that 
IPFW is serious aboui sporls. 

IPFW hasn't gone without a con- 
ference championship, however. Two 
members of the women's tennis learn 
brought home individual titles from the 



GLVC tennis tournament last monlh. 
Manju Usman and Sarah Yaggy, both 
freshmen, gave IPFW ils first-ever 
conference championships. 

If the soccer learn should Tail in its 
effort lo win the team title, IPFW has an 
ace up its sleeve — i 
volleyball team. 

The volleyball team, ted by 
Clara Schortgen, has beaten every 
conference team it has played so far this 
season. Those victories include a five- 
game triumph over defending cham- 
pion Lewis. 

The volleyball squad will begin its 
quest for a conference title Nov. 6 at St. 
Joseph's. 

Winning championships at this level 
will give (he IPFW community and the 
Fort Wayne community something to be 
proud of when talking about the 
university.
