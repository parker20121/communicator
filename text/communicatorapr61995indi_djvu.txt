Eads elected student body president in close race 

Despite minimal turnout, results are positive 



By McIUsa Ynung-FIores 
Chief Reporter 

IPFW siuJcnis selected Kevin Ead5 over 
Cecil Baker by 70 voles as Iheir new slu- 
dcnt body president last week. 

This year's cicclion tum-oul was higher 
than recent years, according lo current 
Student Body President Mark King. 

Despite the increase in studeni panicipa- 
lion, King sai(| be felt the figures need lo be 
higher. Only 678 students participated in 
this year's student body presidential elec- 
tion. 

"I wish sludcnl.s could take even more 
interest in student government elections." 
King said. 

Although Eads found success at the 
polls, his entire lickei did noi reach liic 
executive branch. Shawn Stanley lost lo 



Terri Grimm in the race for vice president 
of legislation. 

The remaining two vice president posi- 
tions were Tilled by unopposed candidates. 
Erin Fridh will assume the role as vice pres- 
ident of SAB and Michael Hcit will remain 
vice president of finance. 

According to Eads, success was 
bestowed on him through hard work. "I've 
spent the last couple of weeks campaigning 
my ... (butt] off. and I am really excited 
^?out the upcoming year," Eads said. "I've 
got a great group to work with." 

Eads and the newly elected vice presi- 
dents will officially lake office at 12:01 
a.m. on May IS. Eads, however, said he 
will begin to look into pcninent issues now, 
so that he can immediately address them as 
president. 

"We are going to learn some of the ins

•S^- 



and outs. I am going lo 
mcel with the executive 
branch to see what our 
agenda will be," said 
Eads. 

Al top priority for 
both Eads and Grimm 
is the proposed 1995/96 
ISPGA budget, 

"There is going to be 
a problem funding 
everything," said Eads. 

"There are lots of these ihat need lo be 
funded more, less, and not at all." Grimm 
said. "LoLs of things ne«d to be changed." 

Funding lo diversify the eampus was 
among those changes mentioned by both. 
Under the current budget plan no ISPGA 
funds go lo the cultural diversity fund. Both 
Grimm and Bads believe this is a grave 



Eads 



error. 

"I wani to increa.sc the awareness and 
the need for diversity," said Grimm. 

"We are going to do our best to change 
that," Eads added. 

Heii. however, commented that the total 
lack of dollars going to the cultural diver- 
sity funds stemmed from the fact that 
ISPGA does not receive enough funds to 
be as active as dicy would hkc. 

"It was the only thing I could do to bal- 
ance the budget. We lose 560,000 each 
year due to the 60-40 split of the student 
fees with athletics," Heil said. "It was a 
simple matter of economics. The senate 
will probably make some cuts lo at least 
restore some of the funds." 

Fridh hopes lo also increase diversity 
awareness through studeni aciiviiies. 
"We're looking into a lot of cultural 



things," Fridh said. "We're trying lo gel a 
variety of singers and lecturers." 

Grimm said she would also like to 
increase the number of student senators. 
Currently, five out of twenty positions arc 
filled. 

"I need lo let people know by going to 
committees and organizations to kl them 
know that they could help make a change in 
or on the campus," said Grimm. 

Fridh said she hopes lo spice up the 
social life of the campus with a conceit. "I 
would definilely like lo sec a concert pulled 
over. Wc arc working wiih other organiza- 
tions.., but nothing LS definite ycL" 

Fridh commented, however, iliai student 
participation could stand some improve- 
menL "I'd love to sec more studeni involvc- 
menl. I'd like to see the campus more 
alive," Fridh said. 



Retention rate analysis 
names recruiting problems 

Suggests several solutions 



ByNoIT. Deckley 
News Editor 

The rale of incoming freshmen 
at IPFW has declined by nearly 
700 students since 1991-92, In an 
effoTi lo reverse this trend, the 
university enlisted the services of 
the Noel/Levitz Centers Inc., a 
national center for investigating 
student retention rates. 

The repon siud IPFW has the 
potential lo "reverse its enroll- 
ment irend if it adopts focused 
and dedicated efforts by imple- 
menting . . . new recruitment and 
rctenlion initiatives." 

Vice Chancellor of Studeni 
Affairs Frank Borelli lauded the 
study and said he felt changes 
could have been made but the uni- 
versily never had conclusive infor- 
mation. "We've always labored 
without definitive data . . . now we 
have some concrete data," Borclli 
said. 

Cuirendy, the administration is 
disseminating the findings of the 
lepon lo the university community, 
according to Borclli. He said some 
changes could possibly be made 
immediately but other changes 
would nOl be possible for several 
years. Borelli also noted die study 
compared trends at IPFW with 
national college trends. 




Borelli 



Noel/Levitz recommended the 
univcisiiy "should consider uuliz- 
ing an estimated financial aid 
package" to lure prospective high 
school seniors lo IPRV. The analy- 
sis also sug- 
gested adopt- 
ing a more 
aggressive 
strategy using 
financial aid 
as a recruiting 
tool. The 
report said, 
"IPFW does 
not use finan- 
cial aid as a 
strategic tool in [he rccruiiment 
process." 

The study identified a need for 
a comprehensive plan to guide 
marketing, recruiting and commu- 
nication endeavors as die "comer- 
stone of all successful enrollment 
development efforts," 

Noel/Leviiz specifically advised 
ihe university to clearly defme its 
desired image, develop individual 
plans for recruiting uadiiiona] and 
non-traditional siudenu and pro- 
mote IPFW in Ohio and Michigan, 
The report also said the university 
should improve response lime to 
student inquiries about grade level 
and financial aid applications. 
The siudy advised implement- 



ing an early-alert system to idcnii- 
fy dropoui-prone students and 
developing a separate retention 
plan for freshmen. "IPFW will be 
able to reduce its dropout rate by 
pulling into place early-alert prac- 
tices and by front loading die stu- 
dent's first year with additional 
institutional interventions," Ihe 
report said. 

The report further stated the 
university should "dramatically 
increase the studeni-centeredness 
of die campus." The steps suggest- 
ed include a continuing aitentive- 
ness towards the students, espe- 
cially in areas identified as prob- 
lem areas by the summary. 

Other areas where communica- 
lions need unprovcment are during 
informal staff meetings, between 
offices and between students and 
outside vendors, such as the book- 
store and cafeteria. 

The analysis strongly suggested 
the university extensively train all 
clerical, technical and support staff 
to improve communication, con- 
flict resolutions and effeciive 
referral Iccbniques, 

A copy of die report is reserved 
in Helmke Library for students. 

Dean of Students Marian 
Zimmennan, head of die retention 
rate group, was unavailable for 
comment.

Judicial court rules in favor of IPSGA 



By MelLisa Young- Flo res 
Chief Reporter 
and Nol T. Beckley 
News Editor 

The IPSGA Judiciary Court handed down its final 
decision of Adkins v. IPSGA in IPSGA's favor on 
March 28. According to Chief Justice Matt Van Ryn, 
the decision was based on the fact diat die senate is 
responsible for legislating rules for referendunis, 

"We came to the conclusion dial if we ruled in his 
favor, we would not be interpreung the constitution. 
We would be making legisladon, which is die senate's 
job," said Van Ryn. 

Student Body President Mailc King was satisfied 
with die court's decision. 

The official decision handed down by the judicial 
court echoed Van Ryn's and King's sentiments. The 
decision said a court ruling in Adkin's favor "^ould 
create a dangerous precedent, and would also cross die 
long recognized balance of power that has been estab- 
lished under alt constitutional democracies." 

Justices Charles Copeland and Andy Hogan wrote 



concurring opinions; agreeing to dismiss the case but 
for different reasons. Bodi opinions dismissed all 
Adkin's points. Hogan said, "I find ihat IPSGA . . 
gave die students of IPFW ample time and adequate 
information to vote on jdie Internet) referendum " 

"I am very happy ihai the court ruled in IPSGA's 
favor. The court showed wisdom beyond Mr. Adkins" 
about the IPSGA constiiuiion," King .said, "The deci- 
sion was based on sound constitutional theory. Mr, 
Adkins asked thecoun lomakelaw. Ii'snot dieirjob," 

Adkins, however said thai he has not received an 
official verdict of the case, "I have not received any 
correspondence from the judicial court about their deci- 
sion. I guess I cannot really comment until I see an 
official decision," said Adkins, 

King criticized Adkins' motives behind die case. "I 
do not believe diat be had die students' best interest at 
mind. On a personal level, I believe Mr. Adkins has a 
thing against my administration. I think he is an idiot," 
said King. 

In response to King's commenis, Adkins said,

Imagine writing a poem in a foreign lan- 
guage and then reading ii before a group. 

That is what Kevin Eads. a sophomore 
history major, did at last Tuesday's French 
poetry contest sponsored by the Cercle 
Francais, IPFW's French Club. 

His poem, "La Fleur Dc Mon Coeur," 
won him Special Recognition. Eads was 
the only student thh year to write his own 
poem for the contest. 

"1 enjoy writing pocuy, expressing my 
feelings," Sriid Eads. 

Receiving the special recognition came 



at a good lime, said Eads. who recently 
was elected student body president. 

"When rumor had it thai I was down in 
the polls, ibc award kept me going," said 
Eads. 

He also wrote his own poem for last 
year's poetry contest, but found it easier to 
do this year because said he has leamed the 
language much belter. 

Eads credits pan of his success to the 
foreign language professors at IPFW. 

"The professors at IPFW have been 
very helpful, not just for me, but for a lot 
of the other students. Nancy Virtue and 
Laurie Corbin were always there when I 
needed help ... and with how busy my 
schedule has been lately, I've needed it 
sometimes." 



For Eads, studying French language and 
culture enriches bis sense of identity His 
grandmother, who helped raise him. is 
from LaHavre in Normandy. France and he 
grew up hearing French as a child. 

"It's nice to know where you come 
from," said Eads. "It helps to make you a 
stronger individual." 

Eads attended the poetry contest with 
bis grandmodier. 

"She had a really good time." said Eads. 

The poetry contest has been the Cercle 
Francais' main event so far this year. Club 
events are open to everyone. 

"You don't have to be fluent to enjoy 
listening to French pociry," said Laurie 
Corbin. professor of foreign language. 

The aim of the club is to expose stu- 



dents 10 French culture, noi just to the lan- 
guage. It takes over where the classes leave 
off. 

According to Corbin, IPFW foreign lan- 
guage courses do try to incorporate ele- 
ments of the culture. 

"Within the (French) basic language 
courses there is some attention to 
"Francophonie," the French-speaking coun- 
tries of die worid." 

Like other activities on campus. 
expanding cultural diversity and apprecia- 
tion of foreign cultures depends upon die 
enthusia.sm of students. New opportunities 
for involvement in foreign language and 
culture may be in the works at IPFW. 

French students may soon be getting 
involved with the local Haitian community. 



"It would be a neat way to uikc the lan- 
guage into the community." said Cotbin. 

Corbin also mentioned the idea of pub- 
lishing a ncwsleiier with poetry in French 
and other foreign languages. 

Eiitls would like to see more opportuni- 
ties for students and more clas.ses oncred 
to introduce students to different cultures 
in addition to learning language. 

He plans to write his own poem again 
for next year's poetry contest. Docs he 
think other students will try to do the 
same? 

"More students could if they wanted 
to," s.iid Eads, "It just takes more time." 

Besides, in French, wallpapering 
instructions would sound eloquent. Maybe 
more students should give it a shot. 



IPFW students to study 
architecture in Rome 



By Melissa Yoiing-Florcs 
Chief RepoHer 

Imagine crisp cool air blowing 
soflly in your face as you walk 
down the streets of Rome, explor- 
ing die art, fine wine, and thou- 
sands of years of history. 

"Fancy dream or another 90210 
episode?" you may ask. For some 
students, what may seem like an 
impossible fantasy may actually be 
a vivid reality. 

IPFW's Civil and Architectural 
Engineering Technology 

Department and Fine Arts 
Department, along with Purdue's 
West Lafayette campus's 
Landscaping Architecture 

Department, arc sponsoring an 
Italian study abroad counc. 

The program has been designed 
to open to students the opportunity 
10 travel across the globe at a more 
reasonable price than they may 



find on their own. 

"I aeated this course four years 
ago as an opportunity for students 
to get some travel experience," 
Matthew Kubik. associate profes- 
sor of Civil and Architectural 
Engineering Technology, said. 

Kubik said the program not 
only allows students to explore 
one foreign city but opens the door 
of opportunity to three. 

"We stay in Rome, and we take 
side trips," Kubik said. " Tliis year 
we arc taking side trips lo Rorcnce 
and Pompeii," 

Although the trip costs S2298. 
the package includes all travel 
expenses, entrance fees, and 
meals. 

Kubik said he believes the 
knowledge, experiences, and 
memories the participants gain is 
invaluable. 

"I think students come away 
with a clear uiulcr-jtanding of our 



cultural basis, our Western histo- 
ry." Kubik said. 

Kubik attributes much of the 
educational value of the trip to the 
diversity of the faculty members 
who teach on the journey. 

Samnntha Durk of the Fine Ans 
Depannieni and a rcpresenialive of 
West Lafayette Landscaping 
Architecture Department also 
accomp.iny Kubik on the voyage. 

"In Rome we walk. look, touch, 
and drink each era of Rome. We 
have this unique opportunity 
because we have this multicultural 
faculty." Kubik said, 

Kubik said the course may be 
taken for credit, but enrollment 
into tlic course for credit is not 
required. According to Kubik, the 
participants have ranged in age 
from 16 to 70. 

Students wishing to participate 
for credit must pay for student fees 
.ind tuition in addition.

The Silver Screen Review: 
Triscilla: Queen of the Desert' 



By Paun\ipper 
Features Writer 

Being ignored by the Academy 
for writing or acting Oscars is a 
scandal, even if this movie won an 
Oscir for Best Costumes, But for 
those of us who saw "The 
Adventures of Priscilla: Queen of 
the Desen" we know what the real 
movie of 1994 was. 

Missed it? Never fear, it is now 
available on video, and it is a ride 
you won't soon forgeL 

The story tells of two drag 
queens (Hugo Weaving and Guy 
Pearce) and a transsexual, 
Bemadctte, {played by the brilliant 
Terence Stamp, who you will 
remember was the lead villain in 
"Supermaji 11") who travels across 
Ausu-alia to perform at hotels and 
to escape from the rut the girls 
have seemed lo have gotten 



themselves in. The title comes 
from the name of their bus in 
which they travel. 

Along die way, they encounter a 
mix of cultures which are enter- 
tained by these performers. In one 
of the funnier scenes, the girl.s end 
up performing their elaborate show 
for a tribe of natives in the desen, 
only to transform one of the audi- 
ence members into a drag queen. 

"Priscilla" has its poignant real- 
-ilics as well. Tlieir bus gels vandal- 
ized and In a touching scene. 
Bcmadettc rescues Falicia from a 
violent homophobe, 

Midway, the girls meet Dob 
(Bill Hunter), who is utterly fasci- 
nated by the "Ic Girls" and decides 
to travel with them. A sweet 
romance builds between lonely 
Dcrnadetie and a recently jilted 
Dob, 

The Oscar for the costumes 



is well deserved. In the course of 
the movie, I guarantee you will see 
some of the most creative outTils 
ever, one of which is entirely made 
of rubber sandals. 

The cabaret shows themselves 
would make great movies. The 
best of the numbers is by far a 
ditty to die tune of "Fin.illy" by Cc 
Ce Peniston. in which the girls 
share the lead and slide down a 
giant pump (yes, pump, as in 
shoe). 

The movie ends witli a surpris- 
ing twist and all of the girls having 
more respect for each other than 
when die journey began. Even bet- 
ter, the writers leave room for a 
sequel. 

For those of you who arc tired 
of the low I.Q. movies of late, rent 
"Priscilla". but do so with a group 
of your friends. This is a movie 
meant 10 be seen with a group. 



iVIusic Review: The soundtrack 
to 'Priscilla: Queen of the Desert' 



By PuulTUpper 
Features Writer 

What more could you want 
from a movie soundtrack? "The 
Adventures of Priscilla: Queen of 
the Desert" is essential for any 
party. The songs appear in the 
order in which they appear in the 
movie, and you could take the 
journey without seeing the film. 

The only misstep is the open- 
ing song by Charlene. "I've never 
been to me," I have gotten in 
many fights over this song; I hate 
it, but many of my friends love it. 
You be the judge. After listening 
to it, you'd never guess that it was 
originally a Motown release. 

The rest of the CD is a mecca 
of gay disco classics. The first 
being the original "Go West" by 
The Village People, which was 
recently covered by ,the Pet Shop 
Boys. 



Love the Nightlife" by Alicia 
Bridges. "I Will Survive" by 
Gloria Gaynor. and "Shake Your 
Groove Thing" by Peaches and 
Herb. As an added bonus, these 
songs appear twice; once in their 
original form and once in their 
new nineties remix versions. 

Other old and new songs rang- 
ing from t950's "I Don't Care If 
the Sun Don't Shine" by Paul 
Page to 1991 's "Save the Best For 
Last" by Vanessa Williams serve 



to remind us that good music has 
been written in all eras. 

And what movie soundtrack 
about three aging drag queens 
would be complete with out the 
presence of ABBA? Yes, they are 
here 100 with "Mamma Mia" 
(even though "Dancing Queen" 
would have been a better choice). 

This CD is a must for anyone 
wanting lo try their hand at drag, 
or if you just love the movie as I 
did. this is the uliimale memora- 
bilia.

In search of... 

The Best Chex Party Mix 




By Kara Whiting 
Feulures Editor 



Okay kids. Uiis week's lasie lesi look me to the pany mix aisle. Not 
dial there rcaJly is a parly mix aisle, but when I perused Ihe choices I 
discovered [hat there very well could be. What I decided to do this 
week was to search out the beat Chex Mix brand party mix. The people 
from Chex only have three varieties: Traditional. Cheddar and Bold 'n 
Zcsty. 

To rale these three 
party mixes I have 
decided that bites will 
suffice. One bile is 
wordiless. Two bites are 
okay, but who are we 
kidding people, go back 
111 Ihe kitchen. Three 
hues are well, a lot bet- 
UT ilian two. And four 
hiti-'s are grrrrrreatM 
1 1 ii.&gt;ps. wrong product.) 

Let the games 
begin. 




TRADITIONAL CHEX PARTY MIX 

Tliis particular parly mix contains bolh com and wheal chex, round 
and window pane shaped pretzels, bagel and rye chips and bread twists. 
Well, not actual bread twists, just miniature, crunchy objects thai look 
like bread iwisLs. Anyway, for a serving of two-thirds of a cup. you are 
consuming 3.5 grams of fat and 130 calories. As for the taste, it was 
good. The pretzels need lo have more flavor, but odier than that, this 
mix is the grub. My final rating for the Traditional Chex Mix is three 
biles out of a possible four, 

CHEDDAR CHEX PARTY \nX 

This mix contains both com and wheal chex, round and window 
pane shaped pretzeK and peanuts. For a serving of iwo-lhirds of a cup 
you get 4.5 grams of fat and 140 calories. This mix was strange, to say 
Ihe least. First of all I felt like 1 was eating Post Raisin Brand cereal 
because in the cereal there are about two raisins for every 50 flakes. 
This was die case with die so-called peanuLs. I kept digging and dig- 
ging and could only Qnd three or four at most. This was a sad disap- 
pointment. This led me to stop eating this poor attempt at a pany mix 
and give the Cheddar Chex Mix a mere one bile out of a possible four. 



BOLD -N ZESTY CHEX PARTY MIX 

As with die last two. this Bold 'N Zcsty pany mix contains both 
com and wheal chex. but here's a change, pretzel bows, garlic bread 
sticks and dark rye chips. But here is the kicker; you may want to sit 
down for what you are about to read. For a serving of one-half of a cup 
of pany mix you consume 7 granii of fat and 160 calorics. 1 guess I 
will forget die diet thing. But after lasting this pany mix, maybe not. 

This mix was very 
sally and had a strange 
taste which I could not 
pinpoint. The bread 
Slicks are dry and taste- 
less, which could be a 
problem for some. 
Frankly, 1 was hesitant 
to give diis pany mix a 
rating, bui to be fair 1 
will: one-half of a bite 
out of four bilcs.e rating 
for diis one. Better luck 
next time.

Elections? Here? 



The SiuiJcnK' Govtmmcnl jusi 
finished cnnduciing (heir yearly 
election for officers, and overall 
Ihey did a good job. The sludents. 
howcva, (lid noi do as well. Oui of 
a siudent [wpulaiion of more ihan 
11.000, only 67K studcnis managed 
to vole. 

The results of any election arc 
only as valid as die number of peo- 
ple who vole in the election. Il is 
Ihc responsibility of the organiza- 
tion conducting Ihc election to 
make the voting as accessible as 
possible. It Ls abo their responsibili- 
ty (0 advertise the lime, date and 
place of die elections. 

Aldiougb the clcciion was well 
advertised, a litUe more could have 
been done. For citample, professors 
could have been asked to remind 
students that the election was taking 
place that week. 

Udier than dial, the advenising 
was sufficient, 1'bc availability of 
the voling booths were not. 

The voling booths were only 
open until 6 p.m. Thai meant that 
any student who only attended 
evening classes would not be able 
(0 vote, or would need to make a 



special trip to do so. 

This is a problem, Tlie students' 
government needs to make sure that 
the voting is equally accessible to 
all students. If this means opening 
the polls early on one day. or clos- 
ing diem later on another day, Uiey 
should. 

Despite the fact that the polls 
were not open in the evenings, the 
majority of students did not vote. 
This is a problem. 

The Indiana-Purdue Students' 
Government is jusi Ibal, the stu- 
dents' government. This system 
breaks down when students do not 
take pan in the process. 

Any student who did not vole 
does not have a valid reason to 
complain if the students' govern- 
ment docs something they don't 
like. They also should not complain 
if the students' government fails to 
do something they would like done. 

The students had dieir chance. 

What will they do this 
November when il comes lo vote 
for the city elections, or in two 
years, for the presidential elections? 
Will they once again choose not to 
vole? 



Letters to the Editor 



Column benefits students 



Judging from the number of let- 
ters bis column has inspired, Paul 
Tupper is exactly Ihc kind of 
columnist a newspaper needs: one 
who is read by many and talked 
about, one who stirs inteiest and 
controversy, one who generates 
readers and response. The 
Coimnunicalor is well served by 
his thoughtful and courageous 
presence. I do not agree with every 
idea Paul expresses, but I believe 
we all benefit by his expression in 
several ways. 

For example, because of Paul's 
column, Larry Gwaltncy was 
inspired to write a letter (The 
Communicator, 3/16/95) that per- 
fectly expresses die tnic culture of 
hate in which homosexuals must 
siniggle to build positive identities. 
Mr, Gwalmey's letter offers abun- 
dant evidence for why il lakes 
courage for Paul to write at all, and 
there is much we can learn about 
the struggles of homosexuals from 
reading Gwaltney's letter closely. 

People who hate often justify 
their feelings by defining those 
tliey hate as standing outside the 
normal parameters of human life. 
Mr. Gwaltncy does this widi Paul 
Tupper, using every standard argu- 
ment currently popular wiihin die 
culture for why homosexuals 
should be denied full human digni- 
ty and respect. 

Gwaltncy employs Uie metaphor 
of madness, suggesting there is no 
"rational" justification for keeping 
Paul's column and accusing Paul 
of having "only occasional boutfs) 
with lucidity." Paul is my advisee 
and a student in one of my classes 
this semester; I assure you he is 
lucid indeed, 

Gwaltncy suggests the metaphor 
of disease, comparing homosexual- 
ity lo alcoholism or drug addiction 
and portraying homosexuals as dis- 
ease-ridden and utterly lacking in 
self- control. He describes Paul's 
homosexuality as "abhorrent nar- 
cissism" and "personal vice." He 
makes repeated use of language 
that suggests homosexuality as 
subhuman ugliness: "toadkill." 
"repulsive," "slinks," "idiotic," 
"societal aberration." 

Similar language and metaphors 



have been used in odier times and 
places to justify hatred for blacks, 
political aciivisLs, Jews, and others. 
The nature of hatred doesn't 
change, but who will be a culture's 
recipients of haic is from time lo 
time redefined. These days gays 
are the culture's hated target of 
choice. 

On March 23, Stacy Edgar 
added his voice to the discussion of 
Paul's column. While I agree with 
Mr. Edgar's objection lo stereotyp- 
ing and name-calling, I couldn't 
help but notice itiai he committed 
the very bffehsc he was objecting 
to with bis own bclililements, 
Edgar asked if Paul wanted a 
siercotypically feminine piece of 
women's clothing (any woman 
who has grown up in this culture 
can tell you thai there's no greater 
insult 10 a man than to hint that 
he's a woman) and suggested thai 
Paul might not call himself a 
man. What else would a man call 
himself? 

Other letter writers in the March 
30 issue have taken Paul to task 
either for not speaking on behalf of 
all homosexuals or for claiming to. 
These writers remind us diat there 
are many homosexuals in the 
IPFW commimiiy and dial no two 
of them share the exact same 
views. Any newspaper columnist, 
Paul Tupper included, speaks only 
for himself or herself. 

Most of the letters Paul's col- 
umn has inspired have affirmed 
that Paul's voice is needed, and I 
agree. Docs he sometimes need lo 
be more fully informed before he 
writes? Maybe; a couple of letters 
suggest this is so. Does he some- 
times use language that labels and 
offends? Yes, and while 1 don'i 
excuse his doing diat, I expect ii's 
hard nol to fire ugly labels back 
sometimes when one so often 
receives them. Perhaps if other 
members of the community feel 
that gays (or heterosexuals) should 
be represented differently, they 
should add their own voices to the 
lively dialogue Paul Tupper's 
"Homosexually Speaking" has 
managed to inspire.

Contract 'on' America unfair 



Newi Gingrich's ConUact On 
America" (1 refuse to accept that it 
has anything positive to do With 
America) has identified poor 
Americans as evil Americans, All 
the politics of the unbalanced bud- 
gel is a result of all those la^y poor 
people stealing from the resi of us, 
or so he says. 

Here are some facts: in 
Huntington County in 1994, for 
example, SI, 5 million was spend on 
welfare subsidies for food stamps 
and AfDC That's S0.5 million for 
Aid to Families wiih Dependent 
Children and SI million in food 
stamps to poverty stricken families. 
Guess how much the federal gov- 
ernment paid oul to Huntington 
County farmers in subsidies? (And 
you can be a millionairu to receive 
this subsidy, unlike welfare.) It was 
SlI million!! One Huntington 
County farmer told me dial half of 
his income is from farming and the 
other half is from the government 
for not fanning. Don't tell me tliai 
these same statistics are not being 
reproduced throughout the whole 
farm belt. Huntington County is noi 
unique. 

Why isn't Newt and Company 
crying foul about a free handout lo 
fanners that is 10 times more than 
what welfare recipients received? 



Could it be that die farm lobby ser- 
enades officials in Washington with 
free trips, perks, and of course, re- 
election money? Poor people have 
no resources to compete with the 
farm lobby. 

Also, the SI. 5 billion cut for our 
domestic social programs by Newt 
and Friends isn't going to reduce 
the deficit. Instead, as reponed in 
the Journal-Gazette last weekend. 
Congress is sending SI. 9 billion "in 
humanitarian aid" to Somalia, 
Kuwait, and Bo.'^nia Now if 1 am al 
all math literate, thai leaves us 
deeper in debt than before, by -S0.4 
billion. Unfortunately, there's no 
"humanitarian aid" left for our own 



Newt's Contract On America 
has made many of us realize that 
die pany calling for "a kinder, gen- 
tler nation," is not the party we 
where we want to be. We may have 
been fed up widi Clinton, but Newt 
is worse. Hungry, homeless, unedu- 
cated and unemployed Americans 
will be the result of such 
Republican "kindness." 

I used to laugh when grandpa 
said lo always vote a straight 
Democratic dckeL I'm not laughing 
anymore,

Column helps homosexuals 

Dear Editor. column. It has helped me feel less 

1 have a message for one of your alone and I am sure oUier people 



previous letter writers. To Larry 
Gwalmey: Get a life! You are enii- 
Ued to your opinion, no matter how 
closed-minded you are, as il is your 
first amendment right, but so is 
Paul Tupper. The accuracy of his 
column may be disputable at times; 
I don't know for sure. He does ruf- 
fle a lew feathers at limes with 
what he says and how he voices his 
opinion. Overall though, I like his 



feel the same. The bottom line. 
Larry, is that if you really do not 

like Paul's column don't read it! No 
one is forcing you lo read il! 

1 also have a message to all die 
ill people on campus: Stay home so 
that the healthy people on campus 
can stay healthy! Please!!

Stu(^ents' government for students 



Atter reading your March 16th 
edition 1 noted that the Students' 
Government was again rewriting 
the constitution and the newest ver- 
sion allows for "one senator each, 
selected by the dean of each of Ihe 
schools on campus, to represent the 
students in that school." As a for- 
mer Siudent Senaior(1968-70) and

(1970-71), as well as one of many 
responsible for changing the name 
from Student Government to the 
Students' Government, ii is clear 
thai die meaning of that change has 
been lost. Allowing the respeciive 
deans to make such school affiliat- 
ed appointmenis raises questions of 
loyalty. Students' inieresis are not 
necessarily the same as the admin- 
istration's. Would such senators' 
loyalty lie wiih the dean or with the 
siudents? Il would be a very diffi- 
cult position for anyone to be in. 

If you want the dean to be repre- 
sented OQ the Senaie. put the dean 
on the Senate. If you want siudents 
representing academic units, then 
you need to establish and conduct 
elections. If you want greaier stu- 
dent participaiion in Students' 
Government, give students a gover- 
nance model ihai does not pressure 
ihem to serve the adminisiiaiion's 
interests under the guise of a stu- 
dents' govemmeni.

Homosexually Speaking 

Families need to help come out 



Listening lo coming-out stories 
is one of my favorite hobbies. I 
recently heard a story that is so 
familiar 1 asked permission to 
sliare it widi you, 

Skyler was born to a typical 
family here in Fori Wayne, not a 
perfect family, but typical family. 
His dad was a racist. His mom 
supported her husband, even his 
racist views. He grew up wanting 
10 please his paienis in any way. 
He played baseball and took 
karate lessons to please his father, 
although Skyler received no plea- 
sure frooi these aqtiyi^^es- 

From an early age. Sky never 
understood his 
dad's haired 
for anyone not 




though he didn't know whal a fag- 
got was, he knew diat il was not a 
pleasant thing lo be called. 

After his baseball career fizzled 
out. Sky discovered the worid of 
dance. Widi the encouragement of 
his aunts, his parents reluclanlly 
enrolled him in dance classes. To 
their dismay, he was very good 
and won prai,se early on from his 
mentors. His parents did not warn 
a queeny dancer for a son, ihey 
wanted a ma.sculine football play- 
er. Because of this, support for 
Sky's dancing was scarce. 

When he was in the sixth 
grade, his friends convinced him 
to try OUI for the cheerleading 
squad after they found out Qiai he 
could do the .splits, a requirement 
for cheerleaders and the sole rea- 
son why no Other guy had uied out 
for the squad in the past. Many of 



the middle school's elite students 
supported Skyler. Suddenly, 
Skyler had the popularity he had 
always desired. 

The day after tryouts. Sky's 
fame was over. He was now 
branded a "fairy" by those he con- 
sidered friends. The power of 
ridicule was so great in the first 
hour diat Sky went to the office of 
the cheerleading sponsor and 
withdrew his name from the list of 
candidates. 

Life for Skyler would never be 
the same. Each day. each hour, 
each class meant humiliation. He 
was constantly being leased for 
being a "fairy." He even heard 
teachers make noi-so-discrec( 
comments about him. Coming 
home should have been a relief, 
but thai loo was a place of hate 
and homophobia. 

One night when Sky was fif- 
teen, his dad and mom were 
lounging outside when Skyler 
returned from work. It was evident 
dial his fadier had had loo much to 
drink. He then asked, in a drunken 
slur. "Are you a faggot?" This 
only sent Sky deeper into the clos- 
et. 

When he was seventeen, his 
mother told him that he was not to 
have any of his boyfriends over 
while they were on vacation. His 
modicr had a gay sister, yet she 
was siill saying these hurtful 
things to her son. 

Skyler found it so amazing that 
all of these people in his life, from 
his classmates to his pfu^nts knew 
he was gay before he did Yet they 
did nol help him come to terms 
with himself when they clearly 
had diat opponunity. 

Is there a moral to this story' 
Not really. Just remember Skyler 
when you encounter a Umid per- 
son nol sure of him or herself

Correction: Last week's column ran the sentence "It is a state of 
being and those thai chose that state deserve respeci as anyone else. " 
The original sentence by the author was as follows: "It is a siaie of 
being that desenes the respect of anyone else." The author does not 
belie\'e tlutt homose.itialiiy is a choice.

.-\dkins -from pa gf I 
"Eva since I have bipughi this lo 
the Judicial cuun's attention. I have 
been viciously maligned, h is a 
shame (hat (he presidcn( has lo 
stoop so low 10 use name calling to 
pro&gt;-e his point. Basically it shows 
IPSGA and the student body hii 
character." 

Adkins believes once King has 
lefi office, IPSGA's productivity 
will increase. "Once the president's 
lam has ended IPSGA will be able 
to go on wiib ils work with the slu- 
dcnis' interest in mind," said 
Adkins. 

Justice Trish Hogan and Van 
Ryn both agree however, personal 
feelings or attacks had nothing to 
do with the court's decision. "Wc 
did the only thing we could. Wc 
listened to both sides of the case 
and made the only decision wc 
could." said Hogan. 

Van Ryn commented that per- 
sonal issues were not a matter for 
the court to handle and that the 
bench examined the case on its 
merit, "Kerry went through he 
proper channels. It was the only 
thing the court looked at. Personal 
issues should never come lo bear," 
said Van Ryn.

Joseph Meyers instructs students in class. Meyers is retiring after this semester. 



By NolT.Beckley 
News Editor 

IPFW will bid a fond farewell 
to Joseph Meyers, professor of 
music, when he retires ai ihe age 
of 64. Meyers cited Indiana 
Universiiy'.s excclleni retirement 
plan a.s one fncior in his decision. 

Meyers will continue to teach 
music, but not at IPFW. He said he 
plans to travel globally and teach 
"Master Classes," where only the 
best students in the country are 
invited for the one day course. 
According to Meyers, Ihe receiv- 
ing countries treat the visitors like 
royally, 

Meyers and his wife, Violetle, 
have been teaching "Master 
Classes" for a number of years 
and have traveled to every conti- 
nent except Australia. 

"We will have an interesting 



kind of relirenicnt," said Meyers. 

Meyers advised students wish- 
ing to enter music to learn how to 
read music and become a good 
musician. Those who wish to 
work in the classics should also 
have an extensive background in 
the languages, according to 
Meyers. 

Meyers and his wife came to 
IPFW in 1973 after teaching at 
Western Illinois University for 
four years. 

Meyers hails from Kansas City 
and both he and his wife graduat- 
ed from the Vienna Academy of 
Music in Ausitia. Both toured 
Europe extensively for 12 years. 
Meyers said he and his wife decid- 
ed to sellle down after having two 
children. 

Meyers mentioned several 
memorable moments during his 22 
year tenure at IPI^V. "We were
