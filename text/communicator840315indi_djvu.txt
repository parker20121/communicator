Amendment has merit 



The school prayer amendment 
cuirenlly being considered by Congress 
has merits. 

The amendment stales that nothing in 
the Constitution should be construed 
to prohibit Indivldufll or group prayer In 
the public schools or other public in- 
stitutions. It adds that no perean shall be 
required (o participate In prayer, nor 
shall the slate or federal government 
compose the words tor a prayer. 

The amendmeni is fairly sound. 
Setting aside a minute at the beginning 
of the school day for prayer does not 
require students to pray All it docs is 
allow a time for students who wish to 
proy 

Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah has proposed 
an amendment that Inserts the word 
"silent" into the amendment to limit the 
type of prayer to be allowed. Allowing a 
lime tor silent prayer Infringes on no 
other's rights. Oral or teacher-led 
prayer would, however, interfere with 
Ihe rights of other students who may not 
ntloprayorwho would like to pray in 
an individual manner. The Hatch 
proposal should be included in the 
amendment 

Some argue that the prayer amend- 
ment is ridiculous since students can 
now pray if they choose. There is no way 
anyone can prevent a person from 
praying. However, by nol allowing lime 
Tor the practice of one's religious beliefs, 
students are implicitly discouraged 



from praying. After all. a student who 
may want (o pray may find himself 
conflicting with the day's history lesson. 

Another part of the amendmeni says 
thai the ri^ts of equal access to pubhc 
facilities by religious groups does not 
constitute a government establLShment 
of a religion. 

The Supreme Court ruled in 1962 that 
schools and other pubhc facilities should 
not allow religious functions lo take 
place since the Constitution tians the 
government establishment of religion. 

This ruling is why the Fort Wayne 
Religious Education program must 
operate in trailors parked outside of the 
school building, rather than inside the 
buildingin an empty classroom. Such an 
'nee is rioiculous since the ac- 
; totally voluntary. Other groups 
I schools and hold various 
workshops and meetings, but religious 
groups 

The prayer amendmeni should t&gt;e 
passed simply out of respect for the 
individual's right to participate in 
religious functions, wherever that may 
be; whether in a home or a public 
building such as a school As long as 
there is no requirement for students lo 
particlpale in prayer or other religious 
activities, and as long as it is a silent 
expression that infringes on no one's 
rights. Ihe amendment should tie sup-
