College students support 
Iraqi troop reduction 






By Jamie Smith 



A recent survey conducted by Harvard 
University's Institute of Politics reported that 
three out of five coMi'ne students support a 
reduction of U.S. troops in Iraq. 

"We were focusing on college students' 
attitudes toward foreign policy and for religion 
and moraJity. As pan of any survey, in today's 
youth and college students in particula 



.lbout both sides of the topic. 



"1 support the irunp-. completely, but I do not 
support the war, " Williams said. 

The survey's results could be considered by 
policy makers for future plans, according to 
Anderson. 

"I think these are important facts thai 
policymakers think about as they're making 
decisions about the war in Iraq and activists 
surrounding this issue can use Ithis information] 
-, they advocate for their particular policies.' 



3-chair for the survey, said. 

The telephone survey of over 1,200 college 
students was conducted nationwide at random. 

One poll reported that 3'J percent of college 
students find the Iraq war to be the most pressing 

"College students have a lot of things they arc 
concerned about, but the fact that 39 percent 



points higher than the general public." Anderson 

The majority of college students in the survey 
said they support troop reduction but not 
complete withdrawal. 

"The major difference is that in the fall we had 
22 percent of college students saying we should 
withdraw ail troops and now we only have 11 
percent who say that However, I he percentage . 
college students who think we should 
some troops is much higher," Anderson sail 

College students have different opii 



going to Iraq. 

"They are there lighting tor us and for 
freedom.' junior political science major Steve 
Phillips said, "i think we should strpport any 
involvement our troops, have." 

Results allow politicians and the United States 
to see what college students feel about national 

"I think there is often nines a lot ol speculation 
about what is the real belief college students 
have about the war in Iraq, and we're Irving to 
give people that sort of information," Anderson 

With this information, people can understand 
where college students stand in this debate. 

"We now know that (this issue) is very 
important to them and we know a large majority 
of them want to gradually reduce the number ol 
troops that we have in Iraq.' Anderson said. 

The polls were conducted by a professional 
nonpartisan poll firm called Prime Group.

Unfortunately, the police fake their orders

their opinions, however laughably baseless, do 
matter. 1 could, of course, go on at ihis point

very bad situation for Stan to be in, and is going

for Stan? 

Well, firstly it drives up the price of heroin. 
In a black market the usual rules of supply and

increase in expenses arising from the risk of

that Stan has to worry about getting arrested on

Higher standards and values 
never a bad thing to display 



Staff Editorial 



In Kentucky, a federal court 
upheld a ruling that allows the Ten 
Commandmens to be displayed. 

The Ten Commandments are 
located in front of the Mercer 
County courthouse. 

The decision was made because 
the judges ruled that the display 
is constitutional because its 
historical. 

The point was made that 
the Ten Commandments are 
beside the Bill of Rights and the 
Declaration of Independence. 

Good. Its about time that the 
government does something right 
concerning values. 

Even besides the fact that the 
Ten Commandments are a highly 
religion-, artifact, some represent 
laws in the United States and 
others hold a sense of morality. 



Do not murder. 

Do not steal, 

Those are laws. 

Why shouldn't they be displayed 
in front of a courthouse? 

If you have a problem with 
these, than you have a problem 
with tile whole legal system, 

So why isn't anyone protesting 
that? 

Do not lie. 

Do not commit adultry. 

Do not covet. 

These are all morals that more 
Americans should abide by. 

These are rules that should 
be followed, even by the non- 
religious. 

There is nothing wrong with 
having a good set of standards 
posted for all of America to see.

United 93: too soon to relive attacks 



By Kristen Marschall 



It's been almost five years. Five long years 
since we witnessed the Twin Towers fall to 
the ground, the demolition of the Pentagon 
and a newfound sense of vulnerability in 
our country. 

But js five years enough time to relive it 
all again? 

Director Paul Greengrass thinks so. 

In his new film, "United 93," Greengrass 
tells the story of United Airlines flight 93 
and its fateful journey on Sept. 11,2001.

Emotional showcase 



IPSGA - sponsored concert is 
strong and shining example 



Concert Review 



The Annual IPSGA sponsored concert took 

place on Monday, April JH in ihe Arena of the 
Allen! uuntyYYai Memorial Coliseum and was 
a shining e\ ample ol what concerts ill this area 
should be, but rarely are, 

Chris Carraba and his band, Dashboard 
( ontessional. the lieadliners of the event, 
were, as usual, slightly above brilliant with 
iheir performance to round out the night. 

Though Carraba showed his less-emo and 
more-ugly side early on (note to people in 
the crowd at Dashboard concerts, don'i throw 
things on stage. Chris gets pissed), he toned 
down and had fun with his performance, 
which is always a bright spot no matter who 
the performer. 

Throughout the performance, Carraba 
changed things up nicely with tracks from 
his most. recent hl's The Places That You've 
Come to Fear the Most" and "A Mark, A 
Mission. A Brand. A Scar," a couple of cover 
songs and even closed the night with a brand 
new single that Carraba noted is expected to 
hit the radio within the next week. 

My personal favorite moment of the night 
was Carraba recounting all of the things he 
likes about summer and the one thing thai 
he hates about summer no new episodes 
of his favorite television show. Carraba then 
pim ceded to perform the chorus of the song 
"{ alilorina' by Phantom Plane!, which is the 
i heme sougol his lavorite show "The O.C." 

As an "O.C,'' fan myself, I was quite amused 
and happy at this point, 

Carraba also did a gnat job in incorporating 
a variety ol songs Irom each album and I was 
happy to hear my favorite tracks "The Places 
thai You've Come to Fear the Most" from the 
diM (it the same name. "As Lovers Go" from 
Join's "A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar" 
and also his 2002 breakout hit "Screaming
