^Prison 

From Page 1 



In 2007. the country 
spent more than $49 
billion keeping over 
2.3 million prisoners 
behind bars. If cur- 
rent trends continue, 
the cost is expected to 
reach nearly S75 billion 
in 2011. 

There is stil! time to 
change the legal system. 
There are other options 
than prison. 

Imagine that a young 
man decides lo steal a 
car and take it for a joy- 
ride. He ends up in an 
accident and destroys 
the vehicle. He survives, 
but is immediately 
caught by police. 

The car was worth 



time off work to attend 
the trial. The total cost 
to the victim might be 
around $12,000. 

However, sending 
the thief to prison for 
just one year could cost 
the taxpayers twice that 
much. 

According to the In- 
diana Department of 
Correction Web site, it 
costs $21,531 a year to 
keep someone incar- 
cerated in Indiana. This 
is slightly lower than 
the national average 
of around $24,000, If 
a nonviolent criminal 
costs society less than 
$20,000, why charge the 
taxpayers thousands

From 930 to 1262, 
Iceland was governed 
by a rather unusual sys- 
tem of laws. According 
to "Private Creation and 
Enforcement of Law: A 
Historical Case." a pa- 
per by economist David 
Freedman, there were 
no criminal offences. All 
offenses, even murder, 
were dealt with as es- 
sentially civil offenses. 

In ancient Iceland, 
most punishments 
handed out were fines 
paid to the victim of the 

If a victim lacked the 
financial resources to 
prosecute a criminal in 
court, he could sell his 
case. Anyone purchas

selves and, if they

ments. A skilled lawyer 
could make a good liv-

If criminals could 
not afford to pay their 
fines, they were placed 
in a kind of indentured

were given fines instead 
of prison sentences, it 
would have saved $16.3 
billion. 

Punishing non- 

violent criminals with 
fines rather than prison 
would keep criminals 
productive and adding 
to the economy. More 
importantly, it could 
help repair the damage 
caused by crime, rather 
than just compound- 
ing the problem with 
expensive prison sen- 
tences.

Spring break savings 



By JESSIE RUCKMAN 

RuckjIOI&amp;ipfw.cdu 



The 



I has 



■ countdt 
officially begun, and 
Ihe spring break clock 
is ticking. Studenrs and 
families are finalizing 
plans for one week of 
homework-free bliss, 
but be warned: though 
one may be tempted 
to go all out and empty 
their wallets, try to reign 
in spring break expenses 
by emploi'ing a few 
common sense tips. 

Don'i worr^', though. 
A week of parrying can 
be done on a budget 
without skimping on 
fun. 

One: If you're lucky 
enough to travel out of 
the country, purchase 
packages before you 
leave the country'. Lei's 
face it, the U-S- dollar 



is weak right now, and 
should you hit Europe 
up for spring break fun. 
you'll want the most 
bangforyourbucL Rail 
and hotel packages can 
be purchased online or 
through travel agencies, 
and they will save you 
cash in the long run. 

Two: Stay with 
friends. So what if 
they live in backwoods 
Virginia? The point of 
spring break is to get 
away from here. How 
many people do you 
know who say, "Hey! 
Let's go to Fort Wayne 
for spring break! Those 
guys know how to 
party!" Travel anywhere 
and keep it cheap so 
that you can focus on 
what's really important: 
relaxation and fun. 

Three: This is for 
men and women alike. 
because the times 
are changing, (f you 



are going to a tropical 
destination or not, pack 
one very important item: 
condoms. We're all adults 
here, and you need to 
protect yourself. 

Picture this: It's March 
2009. You're sitting on 
the couch next to your 
significant other, the 
phone rings and a voice 
from the past comes on 
the line. "Hi, remember 
me from Panama City? 
How are you? By the way, 
we have a 3-month-old 
together, so I'm going to 
need support checks." 

Raising a child would 
be the most costly spring 
break expense you could 
ever incur, so be a boy (or 
girl) scout and plan ahead. 
Chew that over while you 
pack for vacation and 
remember the bottom line: 
fun is most important. 



Monopoly money 

If monopolies are bad, what 
about government monopolies? 




Op/Ed 
By DOUGLAS SCHMIDT 



Software behemoth 
Microsoft has been 
fined over Sf.3 billion 
by ihe European Union 
for "anticompelilive" 
behavior, the highest 
such fine ever issued 
by Ihe EU. This brings 
Microsoft's loial fines

The EU has two 
main grievances against 
Microsoft: the high 
software royalties the 
company charges rivals

that the company 
bundles Windows with

The administration responds 
to "IPFW: the astonishing truth" 



A commentary by 

Roben L Sedlmeyer 



Recently, an article 
titled, "iPFVV: The 
Astonishing Truth," 

was circulated around 
campus and published 
in the Communicator. 
Written by Ms. Paige 
Smith, the article details 
the experiences of Mr. 
Christopher Woodard 
in seeking information 
about, and satisfying the 
degree requirements for, 
the Associate of Science 
in Information Systems 
(ASIS). 

The article questions 
the truthfulness, 
honesty, and 
integrity of IPFW 



school/division, and Information on the IPFW

and departmental Woodard's request was 

not made until lanuary 
28, 200B. If he had 
submitted hisapplication 
on time, the Computer 
Science Department 
would have performed 
a graduation audit and 
discovered that he would 
not fulfill graduation 
requirements. 

It would have been 

easy to adjust his 

schedule to correct this 

situation. As it happened,

as a major he met with 
a professional ETCS 
advisor. She shared

students. The 
article details only Mr. 
Woodard's perspective; 
no corroborating or 
contradicting evidence 
was sought by Ms. Smith 
from the IPFW personnel 
involved. 

I am writing this 
response to offer a more 
complete account of Mr 
Woodard's predicament toward 
and of both his and 
IPFW's responsibility in 
creating and resolving it. 

Mr. Woodard claims 
that the IPFW website 
does not accurately state 
the requirements for the 
ASIS degree. This claim 
is justified. In translating 
the hard-copy version 
of the IPFW 2006-2008 
Bulletin to the web, 
several requirements 
were inadvertently 

omitted and others were 



with him the specific 
degree requirements 
as represented in a 
commonly used form 
known as the "bingo 
sheet." 

For the next three 
semesters Mr. Woodard 
met with this advisor 
to plan his classes and 
ensure steady progress 
degree 
objective. Mr. Woodard 
admits to having seen 
these requirements and 
havinga copy of his bingo 
sheet. At no time, as the 
article stales, was Mr. 
Woodard "leftcompletely 
in the dark" about what 
courses were needed to 
complete the degree. 
Of his own volition, he 
chose to ignore this 
accurate and complete 
representation of the 
degree requir 



extraordinary 
effort to help Mr. 
Woodard recover 

from this unexpected 
situation, the Director 
of the ETCS Success 
Center, Sarah Merchant, 
and the Dean of ETCS, 
Dr. Gerard Voland, met 
with him to explore 
his options. The two of 
them, with subsequent 
input from me, crafted a 
plan that will allow him 
to participate in the May 
graduation ceremonies 
and complete his degree 
in the summer. The 
Dean ivtote Mr Woodard 
a recommendation for a 
scholarship to defray the 
additional tuition costs. 

The article goes to 
great lengths to blame

Once Upon A Pig: 



, Prince Charming is real in "Penelope" a modern 
fairytale featuring Christina Ricci and James McAvoy 



By ANDREW STACKHOUSE 

icytaLiiBha tmail.to m 

"Once ilpon a time," is 

the ubiquitous fairy tale 
opening line of "Penelo- 
pe". With curses, a prin- 



cess-like character, and 
many other fairy tale 
trappings, one would 
ihink this modern-day 
fairy tale would be cli- 
che. However, an engag- 
ing plot, intriguing char- 
acters, and beautiful sets 



and costumes make this 
tale soar. 

The movie centers 
around Penelope (Chris- 
tina Ricci), a twenty- 
something girl who 
bares the curse a witch 
put upon her aristo- 



cratic family many hears (Catherine O'Hara) then 

ago. This curse caused stages her daughter's 

her to be born with a dpath so that she can be 

pig's snoul and ears, raised in secrecy, away 

The curse would only be froni the prying eyes of 

lifted when she found the media. As she reach- 

the love of "one of her es adulthood. Penelope's 

own." Penelope's mother mother begins to arrange 



for blue blooded suitors 
to marrj' her daughter. 
The curse must be bro- 
ken, after all. 

Adding to the ploi of 
the movie is the amus- 
ing and varied charac- 
ters. Penelope is sweet

and engaging, but suf- 
fers from solitude and 
self-hate. Penelope's 
mother is over-the-top 
in her desire to see the 
cures ended, screeching 
at everyone and often 
acting the fool, fames 
McAvoy plays an atypi- 
cal prince charming, 
named Max, who may 
or may not be able to 
help Penelope break the 
curse. Similarly, Simon 
Woods entertains as the 



a jerk blue blood who 
becomes terrified of Pe- 
nelope after meeting 
her. Peier Dinklage is a 
ivronged reporter, amus- 
ingly named Lemon, 
who's desperate to prove 
Penelope's existence to 
the world. Lastly, Reese 
Witberspoon shines as 
Penelope's hardened 
friend Annie. 

The sets and cos- 
tumes of "Penelope" fill 
out the eye's paletle. The 



locale of the film, while 
never explicitly stated, is 
London, England. Sucb 

a setting adds greatly to 
the movie, which mean- 
ders between fairy tale 
and modern life. Penel- 
ope's manor bouse and 
the streets and sights of 
London are covered with 
an ample, vintage feel. 
Tbey also create an aris- 
tocratic feel that is Jux- 
taposed with tbe almost 
beautiful decay of Max's 



flatand the bar he works 
at. 

Like the locations, 

the costuming also adds 
to the film in a variety of 
ways. While the charac- 
ters look relatively mod- 
ern, the clothes also have 
a certain vintage feel. 
This encourages a mod- 
ern fairj' tale look. The 
costuming also shows 
the division of charac- 
ters, as Penelope's family 
and suitors dress to im- 



press, while Max, Lemon 
and Annie all dress with 
commoner flair. Stand- 
ing in tbe middle is Pe- 
nelope, who wears tbe 
most color and dresses 
in t\owy skirts, coats, 
and scarves, causing the 
eye to gravitate toward 
her. 

With so much going 
for it, Penelope is a truly 
ivinning modern fair&gt;' 
tale that can appeal to 
practically anyone.

IPFW classrooms to receive updated technology 



By LOUISA DANrELSON 

A year ago last winter 
break, 21 classrooms on 
campus were fitced with 
a new Specinim Lectern 
that contains most of the 
electronic equipment 
needed for one class- 
room. 

Holding a DVD/VCR. 
computer tower, screen 
and keyboard, ports for 
power cables and laptop 
access and a 3.6 inch flip- 
up Crestron touch panel 
screen, this unit con- 
nects all the eleclronics 
to other devices (project 
etc.) in the room with a 
single cable. 

This semester, two 
more rooms (Classroom 
Medical building's 35A 
and C) will be updated 
with the new classroom 
technology design. But it 



is over the summer that 
the most work \\t1! be 

In June 2008, 16 more 
classrooms will be re- 
vamped. 

"Those 16 rooms rep- 
resent an estimated 1600 
deliveries, " Joseph Mc- 
Cormick, Manager for 
User Technology Sup- 
port &amp; IT Security. Policy 
and Planning ivith ITS at 
IPFW said. Each delivery 
requires LBC (Learning 
Resource Cenler) to de- 
liver a cart loaded with 
requested equipment 
(computer, projector, 
etc.) to each room. 

"These rooms were 
picked for their cart de- 
livery numbers - They 
had 65 percent of the 
cart deliveries in spring 
of 2007," McCormick 
said. By virtue of install- 
ing new classroom tech- 



nologies, cart deliveries 
decrease and faculty and 
students see a "common" 
setup in each and every 
equipped room. This de- 
creases frustration and 
increases IT Services

ulty and staff ivithin the

was created by the fac- 
ulty senate. 

Benefits to the new 
Spectrum Lecterns are 
in the idendcal setup of 
each system. 

"You see the same 
technology in every new 
room," McCormick said. 

"'Wc"ve had a lot of 



"ITS has about 42 students 

working in lab support and 

nine to 11 full and part time lab 

technicians." 



The Spectrum Lectern 
will be put into rooms 
in the Science Building, 
Classroom Medical. Neff 

and the Visual Arts build- 
ing. Rooms were chosen 
by the Academic Com- 
puting and Information 
Technology Advisory 
Sub CO mm it lee, which 



good, positive feedback 
(on the new Spectrum 
rooms). ..On the whole, 
faculty have (had) very 
quick response from the 
Help Desk.'" 

A special feature of 
the Spectrum Lecterns is 
the small, built-in screen 
that has an instant help 



button. The person op- 
erating the system can 
punch the help button 
and a member of the 
help desk ^vill respond 
by phone or with an on 
screen message within 
minutes. 'We have two 
full time staff devoted to 
tech help," Glenn Mor- 
gan, Manager of Systems 
Administration for ITS 
said. "We get calls on a 
weekly basis," 

Funding for the new 
technology lecterns 

comes from the student 
tech fee. "Which is why 
this goes to general class 
rooms." Morgan said. 
General classrooms are 
designated muld-pur- 
pose rooms, in which 
many different classes 
can be held instead of 
one paiticular type, such 
as dentistry. 

"The purchase of the 



Crestron technology 
for these rooms has ex- 
hausted the remainder 
of the monies devoted to 
student lab equipment 
for the 2008 budget year," 
he said. 

Currendy, ITS has 
about 42 students work- 
ing in lab support and 
nine to 11 full and part 
time lab technicians. 
They have increased the 
hours of the computer 
lab in Walb on Saturday 
nights (until 1 1 p.m.) and 
have added a lab tech for 
15 to 20 hours at the Cole 
Commons labs. Also over 
summer 2007, Office 
2007 was added to the 
machines on campus. 

"We still have a little 
way to go." Morgan said. 
"But almost the entire

Springing Into March 

Shedding a glimmer of light at the end of a long tunnel of winter, Spring officially arrives 
with events and holidays that call for celebration and rejuvenation. yg|

The winter gloom 
begins to wane in the 
month of March. The air 

is still a bit damp, but this 
month still offers plenty' 
of reasons and excuses to 
celebrate. 

IPFW Spring Break 
begins Mar. 10, and 
whether students choose 
to head to sunny beaches 
or relax in Indiana, time 
off from textbooks, tests, 
and deadlines is sweet 
relief. Browse the Mast- 
odon Athletic Calendar 
and find schedules for 
upcoming OUTDOOR 
golf, Softball and ten- 
nis competitions. The 
Rhinehart Music Cen- 



ter is offering numerous 
performances, and the 
Senior BFA Exhibition 

begins Mar. 17 at the Vi- 
sual Arts Gallery. Look for 
Women's History Month 
lectures, discussion 
groups and health fairs 
being offered throughout 
the month. 

Most students do not 
need guidance when it 
comes to celebrating St. 

Patrick's Day, which is 
on Mar. 17. Deck yourself 
out in green, buy tons of 
green food coloring, and 
think moderation! Choc- 
olate bunnies and Peeps 
also bring in Easter joy, 
and a sunrise service can 
also give meaning to the 
day. 

March is also a month 
of many famous birth- 



days. On Mar. 24, why 
not disappear from 
class to recognize Harry 
Houdini's birthday? Hike 
up to lohnny Appleseed's 
grave on Mar. 11 to com- 
memorate his special 
day. 

Dr Seuss would have 
been 104 years old on 
Mar. 2. so dig out your 
lattered-wiih-love copy 
of "Morton Lays an Egg" 
for old limes sake. You 
can also check out "Hor- 
lon Hears aWho" brought 
to the big screen with an 
all-star cast on Mar. 14. 

See how many min- 
utes you can add to your 
phone bill on Mar. 3 in re- 
membrance of AJejtander 
Graham Bell's birthday. 
Uranus Discovery Day is 
on Mar. 13, and how you 



intend to celebrate that is 
your business. Daylight 
Savings Time also begins 
Mar 9, so spring your 
clocks ahead. 

The month finally 
concludes with later Day 
on Mar. 31. 

Looking for any 

reason to party? 

Here are some 

famous March 

Birthdays: 
March 2 - Dr. Seuss 

March 3 -Alexander 
Graham Bell 

March 9 - Baibie 

March' 1 1 - Johnny 
Appleseed 

March 13 - Uranus

The Communicator 



Inexperienced group nearly pulls 
big upset, fall short vs. Loyola 

■ Comeback falls short Friday, team breaks ace record Saturday 



on ol Indiaiu-Punluc Stud 



With things going south in game 
three, coach Arnie Ball had seen enough 
out of his starting lineup to know 
something had to change. That change 
nearly ended up in a Mastodons' win, 
but Loyola had just enough in the end 
to top IPFW, 3-2 at the Hilliard Gates 
Sports Center Friday night. 

The Ramblers took Game 1, 30-26. 
IPFW lied it at one with a 30-27 ivin in 
Game 2, but Loyola jumped out to a 20- 
14 lead in Game 3 which prompted the 
lineup change for the Mastodons. 

In came freshman Ben Duckworth, 
Daro'l Shank, sophomore Nathaniel 
Berg, and seniors Steve Rogers and 
Dan McNerney. 

And, while Loyola took Game 3, 30- 
20, Coach Ball liked what he saw and 
sent that lineup out for Game 4. 

The younger Mastodons responded. 
IPRV opened up a, 9-5 lead on a kill by 
Rogers. 

Duckworth blasted a ball to the 
ground making it, 17-14. 

Loyola climbed back closer as 
senior opposite Ian Anderson drew the 
Ramblers to within one with one of his 
match-high 27 kills. 

Loyola would eventually takea30-29 
lead, but the 'Dons would not go away. 
Senior outside hitter Brock Ullrich, the 
only starter left in the match, tied the 



match at 30 with a blast from the left 
side, 

Ullrich tied it again at 32 with one of 
his 14 kills. 

Shank put the 'Dons up 33-32, and 
IPFW won Game 4 on a Rambler ball 
handling error 

Unfortunately, IPFW couldn't finish 
the comeback. Anderson flexed in the 
fifth as the Ramblers closed it out, 15- 
10. 

Loyola also got double-digit kill 
nights from Joe Guntii (20), George 
Kamberos, and Nick Lamoureux. 

IPFW was led by senior opposite 
Jason Yhost with 15 kills. McNerney 
came on to dish out 29 assists. 

The team broke a school record for 
aces in a match with 15 in a 3-0 sweep 
of Quincyon Saturday night. The Mast- 
odons swept through the Hawks by the 
scores of 30-8, 30-26, and 30-17. 

Shank ran off six straight points in 
game one, including three consecutive 
aces. Ullrich followed that up later in 
the game with seven straight points, 
including four aces in the string. 

In Game 3, senior outside bitter C). 
Macias joined the ace club. He fired off 
four, Ihree-in-a-row at one stretch, as 
IPFW finished the match off. 30-17. 

Ullrich and Duckivorth paced the 
offense with seven kills each.

Baseball drops four straight to open year 



Junior starter Robinson Polanco 
tossed seven innings of four-hit ball, 
and IPFW committed seven errors, as 
the Georgia Slate Panthers took the 
season opener from the Mastodons, 
12-2 on Friday night in Georgia. 

The PantJiers (5-0) opened the 
scoring in the 3rd inning with a pair 
of runs direcdy related to three IPFW 
miscues. GSU's only hit in the inning 
was a bunt single. 

IPFW (0-1} got on the board in the 
4th inning. Senior centerfielder lared 
Davis doubled to left field and was 
chased home on a single by junior 
second baseman Chris Goltschall. 

Georgia State added four more 
in the fifth. Junior left fielder Dusty 
Bennen led off the inning with a triple 
to right. He came home on a fly ball 
from junior centerfielder Nick Hogan 
that was dropped. Sophomore third 
baseman Bradley Logan singled home 
another run as the Panthers took a 6-1 



lead to ttie sixth. 

IPFW got another in the top 
of the frame. Sophomore Shaun 
VanDriessche singled through the right 
side and came home on a Gottschall 
RBI double. 

That is ail the scoring the 'Dons 
would muster as GSU tacked on six 
more to win, 12-2. 

Senior righthander Cole Uebelhor 
was tagged with the loss for the 
Mastodons. He gave up four runs (two 
earned} on six hits, over 4 1/3 innings. 
He struck out one and walked none. 

Polanco gave up both 'Dons runs 
(all earned). He walked tivo and struck 
out two in seven complete. 

The Mastodons and Panthers 
will resume the four-game series on 
Saturday afternoon with a twinbill 
beginning at 1;00 p.m. The series will 
ivrap up on Sunday afternoon at noon. 

The team cured its early season 
fielding woes but fell to host Georgia 



State in a double-header on Saturday 
at The Field. The Panther cruised to a, 
13-2 Game 1 victory and held off IPFW. 
6-4 in the nightcap. 

After committing seven errors in the 
season opener, the Mastodons were 
flawless in today's pair. 

Georgia State (7-0) broke Game 
1 open with six runs in the second 
inning. First baseman Theo Asher 
stroked a two-run single dirough the 
left side of the Mastodon infield. Left 
fielder Mike McCree followed that up 
with a t\vo-run double to right center. 
Centerfielder Nick Hogan tripled to left 
center scoring McCree, and that was all 
for IPFW starter Sam Walker. !n all, six 
GSU runners crossed the plate in the 
second inning. 

The Panthers led 13-0 going into the 
top of the 7th inning, but IPFW would 
breakup die shutout. VanDriessche 
drilled an 2-RBi double down the left 
field line scoring junior catcher Devin 



Taylor, who reached on a hit-by-pitch 
and freshman right fielder Garrett 
Segraves who walked to lead off the 
inning. 

Georgia State starter Kenny Camp 
settled dovra a finally put the 'Dons 
away for the win. He went seven 
complete, giving up just those two runs 
on two hits. 

In the night cap, Georgia State 
took a, 5-0 lead into die 8th inning. 
IPFW began its comeback with an 
RBI sacrifice fly from the bat of junior 
second baseman Chris Gottschall. 
With runners of second and third, 
VanDriessche stepped to the plate and 
launched a missile out of left field. His 
3-run blast made it, 5-4 Panthers. 

GeorgiaState would get aninsurance 
run in the bottom of the eighth and the 
■Dons fell. 6-4. 

GSU starter David Grant got the win 
going seven complete, giWng up no 
runs on five hits. 



Does IPFW Stand 
a chance in the 
madness of March? 

In All Directions 

By DAN VANCE 

dan.vance @f ra ndiisepublrEations.net 

With the regular season wrapped up and 
conference tournament play just around the corner, 
do the first year Summit League Mastodons have a 
chance to make any waves in post-season play? 

A year ago, I probably would have said "of course, 
watch out for Chris Paul and the women!" 

But now? Really? 1 think the chances are about as 
slim as Zeljko Egeric as a freshman 

The women finished seventh in the league, 
strugghng as of late. But, thanks to the Dakota's not 
being eligible for tournament play, Paul and company 
will see a five-seed and a first round meeting with 
Oral Roberts. IPFW was close in the first meeting, but 
fell by 32 points when hosting the Golden Eagles. So 
their chances? Not seeming very strong. 

Had the Dakota's been eligible, IPFW would be 
playing now top-seeded Western Illinois, who at least 
the Dons split with this season. 

Johnna Lewis -Carl isle and Jordan Zuppe will 
probably need to have the games of their careers to 
get by round one. And any furthur? Welt as much as I 
like Coach Paul, he might want to start praying. 

What about the men? They seemed less ready for 
conference affiliation last year, but have flourished 
often, including a pair of huge wins over Oakland. 

A loss to Southern Utah last week lands the 
team at the five-seed as well. Both IPFW and the 
Thunderbirds ended at 9-9 in conference after the 
game, but Southern Utah's higher RPI gave them 
the higher seed. What does all of that mean? Really 
nothing because the two teams were going loplay 
eachother anyway no matter who won the regular 
season finale. 

And I will give it Dane Fife and boys, they should 
take game one in their first postseason play. Afterall, 
they opened their Summit League careers with a win 
against the Thunderbirds and it look ovenime. with 
four main Mastodons on the bench, for Southern 
Utah to exjtct revenge. Unforlunally for both teams, 
a win only means a second round matchup with 
Oral Roberts. That pending a win a Golden Eagles 
thrashing of Centenary, whom they beat twice. 

And getting ORU in round tivo is pretty much like 
winning a boxing match, only to trip on your way out 
of the ring, hit your head and die. 
Sorry IPFW- maybe nexi year.
