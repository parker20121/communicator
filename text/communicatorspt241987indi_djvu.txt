In its first meeting of the school 
year, the Faculty Senate discussed 
changes occurring over ihe summer, 
and debated the smoking policy. 

Steve Hollander, speaker of the In- 
diana University Faculty, noted the 
enrollmenl increase, and two new In- 
diana degree programs in criminal 
justice and in education, Hollander 
worried about a rash of last-minute 
hirings and lamented, "Commu- 
nication between chancellor and Ihe 
faculty IS the worse by far than at any 
other lime in my nearly 20 years al 
this inslilution ' 

Wallace responded that he would 
answer Hollander's "gross mis- 
representations" at a later time in 
writing 

On the other hand, David McCants, 
speaker for Ihe Purdue faculty, 
praised the chancellor for "openmg 
new lines of communicalion" between 
faculty and the chancellor and for the 



successful freshman orientation, 

McCants was critical of local news- 
paper coverage which he claimed 
exaggerated IPFW's defects 

The smoking policy debate reap- 
peared. Chancellor Tom Wallace, in 
his presiding officer's report, gave a 
detailed comparison of his smoking 
policy and the policy endorsed by the 
implementation committee last 
spring. 

While Ihe report was almost identi- 
cal to the one given two weeks ago at 
the Student Senate, Wallace added 
that the university had spent nearly 
$10,000 on the policy and the police 
would issue state tickets to violators. 

Political science chair Mike Downs 
thanked Ihe chancellor for his report 
but introduced two resolutions critical 
of Ihe chancellor's smoking policy. 
Downs' first resolution, which passed 
on a voice vole with only a few scat- 
tered nays, said differences tietween 
the chancellor's policy and senate 
reeommendalion.s had caused "public 
controversy, misunderstanding and 



miscommunication" and called for Ihe 
chancellor lo communicate regularly 
with both the senate and implementa- 
tion committee on all smoking deci- 
sions prior lo the annual review next 
April, 

Downs' second resolution would ban 
smoking in faculty office.s. Downs said 
in certain buildings such as 
Classroom-Medical, the smoke would 
circulate to all other offices. Downs 
also considered unfair the fact that the 
chancellor's policy would allow smok- 
ing in offices of high status employees 
such as professors but not in offices of 
"low status" employees such as 
secrelaries 

Downs' remarks were challenged by 
philosophy professor Kathy Squadrito, 
who asked if Downs had many studies 
of "low-status employees' " attitudes, 
Squadrilo said her secretary smoked 
in the philosophy professor's office 
because she could not smoke in her 
own office nor afford the time to go 
the smoking lounge. 

Downs responded thai he had done 




The Rhythm is gonna get you! 

The IPFW Student Union Board ot Governors held a back la school dance Friday, Sept. IH. The Ihemc of Ihe parly was 
"Back to School Hawaiian Style". IPFW studenU rock-n-roUed to the sounds of Sigma Phi Epsilon Bob Widner, who 
played popular lunes. 

Women assist march 



1 surveys, but the Surgeon General 
had recommended no smoking in any 
offices for morale reasons. 

Communication chair Sandra 
Manheimer said that the ban would 
drive tobacco-using members of the 
faculty home— away from students, 
Joyanne Oulland from Ihe music de- 
partment said members of her de- 
partment would buy air purification 
equipment hut would like lo see 
:imoking remain in faculty offices. 



Survey taken 



Needs Assessment Survey as a class 
research project. 

Although the project was supervised 
by sociology professor Kathy Trier, 
the survey was entirely conceived by 
the students. As far as anyone knows, 
this was the first general population 
survey produced al IPFW. 

Approximately twelve students 
asked a total of 915 people attending 
the college questions such as; "Have 
you received consistent information 
about graduation requirements from 
your advisors'/" and "Do you think 
thai there are student representatives 
actively involved in IPFW 
committees?" 

Over 90% of students surveyed felt 
they needed more representation in 
curricidum changes, alhletics, and 
academic advisory programs. 

The results also yielded some cor- 
relations, such as a correlation be- 
tween housing and student partiuipa- 
tion. Non-while students were less 
aware of orientation activities, but 
more aware of student services than 

Overall, those surveyed felt that 
they needed additional lime offerings 
for required courses. However a ma- 
jority felt satisfied by Ihe variety of 
elec lives offered. 

Professor Trier readily admitted 
that the experience was a valuable 
one and had set an example in the 
future. However, whether or not an- 
other survey will be made this spring 
will be up to the sociology students. 



"Take Back the Night," an annual, 
nation-wide march for women by 
women promoting public awareness to 
women's lack of safety on city streets 
after dark, will be held at Freimann 
Square on Saturday, Sept, 26, 
beginning at 7:30 p.m, 

Terry Johnson, assistant director of 
the Rape Awareness Program, felt 
this rally was a "symbolic march". 

Current FBI statistics Indicate that 
one out of every four women will be 
sexually assaulted in their lifetime 
and that only one out of every ten 
rapes committed in America will be 
reported to the police. 

This march is a "chance (or women 
to go in a collective group down the 
slreeU of Fort Wayne without being 
fearful," stated Terry Worman, 
coordinator of the Women's Center. 



Events scheduled for Saturday eve- 
ning include a short march through 
the streets of downtown Fort Wayne 
followed by a proclamation from the 
Mayor's office read by a female rep- 
resentative. Numerous speeches fol- 
low, including Joan Uelrerhoerr, ex- 
ecutive director of Planned Parent- 
hood and professor of Women's 
Studies at IPFW, as one of the speak- 
ers. The evening will conclude with 
songs and music. 

"Take Back the Night", is being 
sponsored this year by the Women's 
Center and the Women's Studies at 
IPFW. Planned Parenthood, Fort 
Wayne Women's Bureau, Fort Wayne 
Feminists, Victim's Assistance. 'The 
National Organization of Women 
IN.O.W,), YMCA Women's Shelter, 
and the Women's Support Group of the 
Center for Non -Violence,

Women's Center. Walb Memorial 
Union, room G25. 



Single parents gain support 



The single parents' meeting on 
Wednesday, Sept. 16, was more than 
an introductory reception. It was a 
conglomerate ot programs and self- 
heip ideas compiled by Ihe Women's 
Center tor the single parents of IPFW, 

From financial aid lo medical ser- 
vices at a discount rate, plus a com- 
plete list of governmental agencies 
and a group of people on campus 
wilhng lo help in any way possible are 
all attainable from Ihe Women's 
Center 

The major portion of brochures 



dealt with children, Tina Long ot the 
Women s Center states, "Our main 
concern is Ihe kids, ways to keep them 
busy and occupied and off the sireels 
One of the best ways we or anyone can 
help is by distributing alt the know- 
ledge we have available to the parents 
who need it. 

"There are programs from Ihe YW 
and the YMCA that may be of inter- 
est, the college ilseK offers several 
programs for Ihe mini-student,"

be obtained from the Women's Center,

lU president Ehrlich 
eases campus fears 



The recent visit to IPFW by In- 
diana IJniversity's president-elect 
Thomas Ehrhch served as a giant 
step toward easing many fears and 
concerns of the IPFW community. 



^'V0S^^HHH 




I.U. President 
Thomas EhrJich 

Ehrlich exhibited an openness at 
the meeting, held Monday, Sept. 21. 
at IPFW. This openness, according 
to members of the faculty, was a 
"breath of fresh air." 

Such openness has been needed 



within the I,U system for years 
and Ehrlieh's wiHingness to be 
receptive to questions of salaries, 
campus improvements, and pro- 
gram expansion were met with 
general approval. 

Unfortunately for IPFW, his lack 
of support for the construction of 
dormitories on campus was 
disappointing. 

The creation of on-campus dorms 
reportedly would lead to increased 
student involvement in campus ac- 
tivities, but his indecisiveness con- 
cerning this matter is an indication 
of his strong support for the con- 
tinuing alliance of what he referred 
to as "two great universities" at 
the Fort Wayne campus. 

We urge Ehrlich to consider the 
future construction of dorms at 
IPFW. We realize this is a long- 
term goal but we hope that Ehrlich 
is planning such goals in addition to 
any immediate changes. 

This is not a push for in- 
dependence but simply a matter of 
improving campus facilities. 
Dorms would provide a stronger 
sense of unity among the students 
and encourage the creation of a 
"university" atmosphere — some- 
thing desperately needed at IPFW. 



Hidden resources available 



Money for college 
by Irving Bender 



College IS pari of the 
American Dream. Bui costs 
can turn it into a nighl- 
mare. The good news is 
private souree scholarships, 
grants and loans 

Your eligibility tor pri- 
vate source awards has 
nothing to do with govern- 
ment financial aid. 

You are eligible for 
awards based on factors in 
your (or your parents'l 
background. For, example, 
ityouarea WOMAN ;- 



— And you are over 30, 
you are eligible for SI, 500 
award for Vocational- 
Education Training Must 
be a high school graduate. 

—And your field o( inter- 
est is ENGINEERING, you 
are eligible for $7SO-£25O0 
award. Must be an under- 
graduate sophomore. 

AH students are eligible 
(or many awards from the 
many private sources. The 
problem is not, "Is there 



college money for me?" 
(There is literally BIL^ 
LIONS availablel) 

The problem is, "How can 
I know all I am eligible 
for?" There are so many 
sources! 

The Private Source 
Money -For-College Catalog 
removes the mystery. H 
lists awards open to high 
school, undergraduate, 
graduate, post-graduate 
students, professionals, and 
for overseas study To re-

Parking problem 
out of control 

To the Editor: 

The article on parking in 
the Sept. 3 issue of The 
Communicator, "New 
parking guidelines govern 
IPFW," did not tell the 
story correctly. This cam- 
pus is a commuter campus 
and as such, all students 
must either come to class 
by automobile or bus. 

Evening students must 
come by car as the buses 
slop running before classes 
end The parking situation 
did not improve when more 
space was designated "A" 
parking and the distance 
that students, if one can 
find a space to park, must 
' walk to get to class was 
increased. "A" parking lots 
are only one third full and 
"B" parking is over 
crowded The ever-present 
paper hanger is busy tick- 
eting many of those stu- 
dents' windows who parked 
in the "A" zone in despair, 
trying to get to class in time 
for roll call. I twlieve it is 
time for fairness in parking 
on campus. 

Whoever made up the 
t.iyout for parking this year 
didn't check the student/ 
teacher ratio. All he saw 
was the difference between 
ten dollars for "A" parking 
and five for "B", and the 
chance to pick up a few 
more bucks by holding 
one's grades hostage if 
parking tickets are not 
paid Are there any law- 
students out there? Is this 
policy legal'' If so, it is al 
the very least unscrupulous. 
In Ihe picture ac- 
companying the article, one 
can see several parking 



spaces open. If the same 
view would have been 
snapped at class change 
time, a whole other view 
would l&gt;e seen. Cars are 
bumper lo bumper circling 
a lo! without an empty 
space to be seen. It would 
be funny lo watch from a 
distance, but it is not fun to 
l&gt;e there with only ten min- 
utes before classes start, no 
parking place, and a half- 
mile dash with twenty 
pounds of books up three 
floors is still ahead.

young as 
most students. I grew up in 
the sixties. I was aware of 
student protests and saw 
what could be done to im- 
prove conditions when the 
students stood up for their 
rights. I know from speak- 
ing to others how they are 
discouraged by fighting for 
a parking space only to 
pass an empty lot in their 
rush lo class after finding 
one I am not calling for a 
sixties-type demonstration 
— with the campus police it 
would end like Kent State — 
but let's make this column 
several pages long until 
some attention is focused on 
Ihe problem 

The parking situation is a 
mess and the new layout 
has made it worse, not tet- 
ter as the article of Sept. 3 
said. It IS time to get the 
mess straightened out. An- 
other parking lot on the 
fringe would not help while 
several lots are sitting with 
spaces to burn and enough 
paper is hanging on wind- 
shields to get them roaring. 
Open some of the "A" spots 
that are empty for "B" 
parking — please.

New senators 
well-received 

To Ihe Editor; 

Aaah! A breath of fresh 
air. No. I am not talking 
atxiut the smoking policy. I 
am talking about seven new 
senators in Students' Gov- 
ernment. For the first tew 
senate meetings that I at- 
tended, before these seven 
new people petitioned on, I 
found the atmosphere dom- 
inated by Phil Downs, the 
Vice President. I do not 
blame him for the com- 
placent, apathetic attitudes 
of most of the senators, 
most of whom are returning 
from last year, but lo a lack 
of enthusiasm and the in- 
ability to think 
independently 

These senators are fully 
aware that they are to rep- 
resent students, and to do 
so responsibly. It became 
evident at the Wednesday, 
Sept. 2. meeting that this 
was not being done. The 
senators voted unanimously 
to condemn the new smok- 
ing policy, but the majority 
of them had not even read 
it. Also, there is very little 
discussion on any bills or 
resolutions that are passed. 
I should take the time to 
point out that all such doc- 
uments are passed un- 
animously. It is almost 
comical to watch Ihe meet- 
ings, but it is not tunny to 
be represented so poorly. 

Back to the breath of 
fresh air. The meeting on 
Wednesday, Sept. 9. had an 
entirely new air atiout it. 
The new senators partici- 
pated actively, and felt no 
inhabitions about pursuing 
a line of thought or ques- 
tioning a statement made 



by another senator This is 
definitely something new. 
The meeting was lively, and 
decisions were made to look 
into certain student prot&gt;- 
lems. Finally. 

I wish to publicly thank 
the new senators — Teresa 
Dunlap, Tina Long, Pete 
Groves. Kim Teter, Carol 
Hildebrand, Terry 

Granahan. and Jay 
Williamson — tor taking the 
time that is needed lo rep- 
resent the student t&gt;ody 
properly. Hopefully, the 
other senators will catch on 
and start doing their jobs 
right, or make room for 
people who can.

AIDS editorial 
astonishes reader 

To the Editor: 

In regards lo your AIDS 
article on page two of Ihe 
Sept. 17 issue, I would like 
to suggest some things. 

I liked it! It was a very 
severe article in that it told 
people the point, AIDS kills 
It may have been too severe 
though If I'm not mistaken, 



this was your first article 
on AIDS this year. For be- 
ing a first article it was 
very harsh and abrasive. II 
was unlike anything I've 
seen before in this paper for 
two years. I must say it did 
astonish me. Some people 
may get angry at this kind 
of article but I hope that 
doesn't discourage you. It 
would please me to see 
heavier topics, like AIDS. 
addressed in Ihe opinion 
section, but don't get car- 
ried away and turn the 
paper into a side show 
attraction. 

Secondly, I hope you are 
not finished with this topic. 
From what I see and hear 
on TV, radio and magazines 
you can surely write more 
than two columns. 1 would 
like to see what you would 
do with a follow up story to 
this opinion, because there 
has got to t&gt;e another reason 
(or printing this article. 

Tliirdly, I hope you don't 
lose any school support for 
this article. Printing a bold 
article, well, I consider it 
bold, like this shows a little 
change may be coming and 
I would encourage it.

Job search often difficult for seniors 



Ask a thousand college 
seniors lo describe how they 
feel about starting to look 
for a job, and chances are a 
majority of them will re- 
spond with words like anx- 
ious, confused or 
overwhelmed. 

After all, the Bureau of 
L.abor Statistics reports thai 
between I9ft4 and 1995, there 
will be only 17 million job 
openings for more than 19 
million college graduates 
entering the job market. 
The job hunt is now more 
competitive than ever. 

And, despite access on 
campus to career and 
placement counselors, 
many students and recent 
graduates don't know how 
to begin. Once they write a 
resume and start "pounding 
the pavement, " they neither 
have a clearcut goal nor a 
strategy that will keep them 
on the right track, lo the 
right job. 

To give these young job 
seekers a leg up on the 



competition, Drake Beam 
Morin, Inc. (DBM), the 
world's largest career 
counseling and out- 
placement firm, tias cre- 
ated Career Navigator, The 
Computer -powered Job 
Search System — a stand- 
alone, easy-to-use but 
comprehensive computer 
software program that 
guides the job seeker 
through a successful job 
search process. 

Career Navigator, con- 
taining an extensive job 
search handbook and four 
computer disks, is selling 
for an introductory price of 
only f95, and is considered 
a breakthrough product by 
career counselors and spe- 
cialisls in computer-based 
training. It was developed 
by a DBM learn of experts 
in career counseling, ed- 
ucational psychology, com- 
puter programming and in- 
structional design. This 
team utilized feedback from 
focus groups and pilot stud- 



ies conducted during 1986 
and 1987 with more than 600 
students on over 19 major 
campuses, including Smith 
College, the University of 
Texas, Columbia Univer- 
sity, Penn State, New York 
University and the Univer- 
sity of California at 
Berkeley. 

This highly interactive 
and individualized program 
coaches Ihe job seeker. 

constantly providing moti- 
vation and giving practical 
feedback. Some of Career 
Navigator's unique features 
include: 

* self-assessment ex- 
ercises lo develop a mean- 
ingful job objective. 

* training in key Job 
search processes and skills 
(e.g. sell-assessment, re- 
searching, strategic plan- 
ning, networking, inter- 
viewing, resume and letter 
writing, and negotiating). 

* creation and storage of 
up to five different resumes 



and ten different cover let- 
ters using a built-in word 
processor or your own. 

* a file of up to 100 names 
and addresses for follow-up 
and mailings. 

■ a progress monitor. 

* a weekly "to-do" list 
and other key organizers. 

* a permanent personal 
data base for lifetime up- 
dates and reference. 

"We have assisted over 
300,000 Fortune 1000 execu- 
tives with their job searches 
since 1967," says William J 
Morin, DBM Chairman and 
CEO. "Now. through Career 
Navigator, we can offer 
graduating college students 
and young prafesBlooals the 
valuable fmlghts we have 
gained over the years," 

Students wtio participated 
in the campus pilot testing 
described Career Navigator 
as "comprehensive, sys- 
tematic, user-friendly and 
full of high-quality infor- 
mation." They said they 
achieved greater control 



and confidence in their job 
search as a result of using 
the program. 

According to Warren 
Kauffman, CPC Executive 
Director. "With Career 
Navigator, Drake Beam 
Morin has produced a solid, 
practical, affordable, easy- 
to-use lifetime career as- 
sistance program. Career

Math: 



Rush fan, and I 
will always be one, so it 
was with enthusiasm that I 
looked upon the release of 
their latest album. "Hold 
Your Fire." The cover looks 
a bit mysterious and in- 
viting, it not a bit drab. 



The album opens with 
"Force Ten." the single off 
the album. This song for me 
is one of the highlights on 



this recording, and unfor- 
tunately is getting zero air- 
time because a certain 
program director at the lo- 
cal rock station apparently 
doesn't think it's good 
enough. 

"Time Stands Still" fol- 
lows, a beautiful ballad with 
'Til Tuesday's Aimee Mann 
singing backing vocals, the 
first guest singer on a Rush 
album. 

"Open Secrets" and 



'Second Nature" follow, 
dropping into a passive 
mood, and side one ends 
with "Prime Mover." which 
picks up Ihe pace a bit 

Side Two kicks off with a 
song about hiding one's 
dark side. "Lock and Key," 
and then meanders along 
with '"Mission" and "Turn

"ShaU We Dance?" 

Cuiuiiiighani choreographs new ballet 



Shan," which is a pretty 
ode lo the country of China, 
is one of my favorites. 

The album clases with 
"High Water. " a lengthy 
song that is sort of just 
there. 

The overall concept/ 
theme of the album is one 

of conflict. Conflict of man 
and man against himself A 
lot is centered around anti- 
war statements, and mere 
foolishness of wars 

As always. Pearl's lyrics 
are eloquent and mean- 
ingful, written in a true 
genius framework. The 
musical ability is still there, 
although it doesn't manifest 
itself as much as earlier 
Rush albums do In some 
ways I was sort of dis- 
appointed and others, very 
satisfied. 

Produced by Peter Collins 
and Rush, '"out of five 
stars Recommended, al- 
though Rush fans will like il 
more than standard listen- 
ers will.

IPFW soccer team losses mar new season 



BY MIKE UNVILLE 
Sports Editor 

The IPFW soccer team 
may have come up wilh a 
new meaning for the word 
frustration They ballled 
the visiting Ball State Car- 
dinal learn to a one-one lie 
after regulation play and 
two ten-minute overtime 
periods last Saturday at 
IPFW. Even more frustrat- 
ing to the Mastodon team is 
the fact that this was a 
game Coach Bronn Pteiffer 
believes his team should 
have won handily. 

"We weren't in the game 
mentally, we weren't ready 
to play," said Pfeitfer. 

IPFW started strong, 
scoring their goal wilh just 
under four minutes gone in 
the first half, but the flow of 
the game slowly turned in 
favor of the Cardinals. 



After a delay atraut hall- 
way through the first half 
due to the injury of fresh- 
man midfielder Jim 
Morrow, who was taken off 
the field by ambulance men 
with a dislocated ankle, 
Ball State went to work. 
They missed a penally shot 
and had a goal called back 
due to being off sides. The 
'Dons also missed three 
chances in the last third of 
the first stanza. 

"We weren't in the 
game mentally, 
we weren't ready 
to play," — Bronn 
Pfeiffer. 

The fans were barely 

settled in their seals for the 
start of the second half 



when the Cardinab tied the 
game. Less than two min- 
utes elapsed before the Ball 
Slate goal. 

Play went back and forth 
for the rest of the half with 
IPFW keeping pressure on 
the Cardinal goal but not 
being able to get the go 
ahead score 

In the first two overtime 
periods neither team domi- 
nated play, but momentum 
look a sudden shift m the 



fcond 



the 



Cardinals' favor. Ball Slate 
was awarded a penalty kick 
and two comer kicks in the 
period and almt&amp;t scored on 
one of the corner kicks 

"We played well early but 
we had mental breakdowns 
on a number of breakaways 
and we didn't convert," 
said Pfeiffer 



"We let them iBall Slate) 
back in the game. Even 
though we were a better 
leam they became confident 
and played hard," Pfeiffer 

The 'Dons had 13 shots on 
goal with sophomore Jerry 
Jenkins getting the Dons 
single tally. Kevin Mann 
had 11 saves in goal 
Ahmad Zahidin tallied for 
Ball State 

Pfeiffer mentioned the 
play of Jenkins, who has 
been converted from a 
goalie to a midfielder. 
"We've adjusted very well 
as a team since the start of 
the season when we had 
three goalies. Now two are 



playing the field and Jerry 
Jenkins has been the key. 




The University of South- 
em Indiana paid a call on 
the 'Dons. Wednesday. Sept 
16, and went home with a 4- 
victory. 



"We were not ready lo 
play and we didn't capital* 
lie on opportunities," said 
Pfeiffer. 

Southern Indiana opened 
with three goals in the first 
half and added a single 
tally in the second. SI 
pounded the 'Dons' goal 
with 18 shots and two 
corner kicks IPFW had 
seven shots on goal. Mann 
totaled II saves while the SI 
goalie turned away six. 

IPFW'S record iS now one 

win, two losses and one tie. 
Two road games take the 
'Dons to the University of 
Indianapolis (Saturday, 
Sept 26) and Saint Francis.

Tennis team inexperienced 



The IPFW girl's Unnis 
team dropped its fourth 
match of the season this 
past Saturday, losing lo 
Northern Kentucky 9-0. It 
was a part of a three-way 
match which included St. 
Joseph's and was played on 
the 'Dons' court. 

"We. ..are building 
for the future- 
...," — Coach Graf. 

It has been a lough sea- 
son so far for the 'Dons 
tennis team and first year 
coach C J Gral At early 
practices, only a few girls 
showed any interest in par- 
ticipating Enough girls fi- 
nally showed up to form a 
team. It is a young squad 
with four freshmen, two 
sophomores, two juniors 
aod no seniors 

"We have a lot of under- 
classmen and are building 
for the future and the girls 
have been working hard." 
said Graf 

One player that Graf was 
counting on to help the 
team had to quit because of 



an injury, Freshman 
Mickey Cook, who is at- 
tending IPFW on a Softball 
scholarship, pulled a car- 
tilage in her leg. The injury 
would not keep her from 
playing tennis but if she 
would re-Injure the leg it 
might put an end to her 
Softball career. 

Losses have been to the 
University of Indianapolis, 
9-0; Franklin College, 7-2; 
St Joseph's College. 8-1; 
and Northern Kentucky, 9-0.

I MADE $18, 
COLLEGE 





When my friends and I graduated 
from high school, we all took part-time 
jobs to pay for college. 

They ended up in car washes and 
hamburger joints, putting in long hours 
for little pay. 

Not me. My job takes just one 
weekend a month and two weeks a year. 
Yet, I'm earning $18,000 for college. 

Because I joined my local Army 
National Guard. 

They're the people who help our 
state during emergencies like hurri- 
canes and floods. They're also an 
important part of our country's military 
defense. 

So, since I'm helping them do such 
an important job, they're helping me 
make it through school.

As soon as I finished Advanced 
Training, the Guard gave me a cash 
bonus of $2,000. Then, under the New 
GI Bill, I'm getting another $5,000 for 
tuition and books. 

Not to mention my monthly Army 
Guard paychecks. They'll add up to 
more than $11,000 over the six years 
I'm in the Guard. 

And if I take out a college loan, the 
Guard will help me pay it back— up to 
$1,500 a year, plus interest. 

It all adds up to $18,000— or more 
—for college for just a little of my time. 
And that's a heck of a better deal than 
any car wash will give you. 
THE GUARD CAN HELP PUT 
YOU THROUGH COLLEGE, TOO.
