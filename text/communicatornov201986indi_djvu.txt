New women's center opens 



ByMARYPOPOVICH 
Staff Writer 

The women of IPFW now have a 
place to call their own. The women's 
center opened its doors Nov. 19, in 
Room 025 of the Walb Memorial Union. 
Union. 

First day activities included an all- 
day open house and two sessions of a 
workshop entitled, "New Directions for 
Women." 

The center also hopes to give new 
directions tor women on a day-to-day 
basis, according lo supervisor Donna J. 
Middleton. "Primarily the center will 
serve the returning adult woman, but 
that doesn't mean we won't service a 
17- or IB-year-oId student," said 
Middleton, who is also IPFW's af- 
firmative action officer. 

The women's center is open daily 
Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. lo 
2 p.m., and evenings Monday through 
Thursday from 6 lo 8 p.m. Its aim is lo 
provide information and assistance lo 



current and prospective students. The 
center is expected lo be particularly 
useful to non-traditional students, who 
may need a little sympathetic help lo 
combine being a homemaker or em- 
ployee and successful college student. 

"We are saying women have special 
needs," Middleton said, "Say you're 
starling school for Ihe first time or 
you're returning atter a number of 
years of layoff from school. During that 
lime you have gotten yourself a job. you 
have gotten married, and you have all 
those responsibilities." 

When a woman decides to return lo 
school, Middleton points out, those old 
responsibilities do not fade away. "I 
think women are unique in having 
that," she said. 

While Middleton notes that there are 
some men at IPFW with similar 
situations, she said Ihe women's center 
was created because "there's a greater 
number of women who have those kinds 
of responsibilities" along with going lo 
school.

students were not the only ones caught off guard by Tuesday's snowfall. Finding

Campus minister keeps 
busy serving IPFW 

By JANET WIDDIFIELD 

Staff Writer 

First hi a series 

Serving as campus minister in Fort Wayne for Che past S years hasn't slowed 
down Rev. Margaret McCray-Worrall. Her daily schedule and developing projects 
exceed by far the busiest of students thai she serves. 

Just last week she was hosting 25 members of a group with Statewide Ministry. 
The members included campus ministers from various universities who were 
meeting for two days in Fort Wayne. 

MeCray-Worrall begins the day at 6:30 with her Wellness Class al ihe 
Multipurpose building. She counsels two to three students a day coming with 
problems related to school, stress, family and alcohol. 

She also serves as campus minister at Indiana Institute of Technology. "There 
are many foreign students attending Indiana Tech," says McCray-Worrall. "I 
enjoy broadening my knowledge of culture and learning of their religious beliefs 
by working with them." 

McCray-Worrall is leading an eight-week seminar tor first year medical 
students on medical ethics. The course is run thru Ihe medical school and although 
It IS not required or graded, McCray-Worrall feels it should be, "I'm interested in 
gelling sludenls to view their own ideas and examine their own prejudices on 
morality in medical issues," she says. "1 feel they need lo confront their own 
assumptions about the role of doctors in our society. " 

McCray-Worrall started the University Rehgious Forum which meets once a 
month. Soup and sandwiches are served and donations are accepted though not 
required. "I'm very proud of Ihe quahly of our programs." says McCray-Worrall. 
"We openly discuss everything from politics and religion to phUosophy and 
educational issues," The topics coming up will range from March's "Future 
Methods of Human Reproduction" to January's "Entropy and Vou" given by 
Chancellor Wallace. 

McCray-Worrall preaclws nearly every Sunday at different churches. She goes 
to Indianapolis at least once a week tor Campus Ministry meetings. Two days a 
week she serves at Indiana Tech as advisor to residence assistants. 

She recently look three students to a retreat in Indianapolis. In addition lo her 
work with others, she is working on her doctoral of ministry, specializing in 
pastoral counseling and psychotherapy.

Not only is there a grealer number o 
women students felt to have such multi- 
responsibilities al IPFW, but there are 
also more women in general, according 
to enrollment figures from the last 
several years. Figures compiled by 
registrar Jack C. Dahl for the current 
fall semester show that 55.3 percent of 
IPFW's students are female. Perhaps 
even more significant is that 28.5 
percent of Ihe 10,182 students enrolled 
are women over the age of 25. This is 
the group most often associated with 
the term "returning adult woman" 



student, for whom Ihe women's center 
primarily was designed. 

The women's center evolved from Ihe 
IPFW Women's Task Force, which was 
appointed in August by Chancellor 
Thomas P. Wallace, The task force is 
chaired by Middleton and Judith 
Clinton, executive director of univer- 
sity relations. Members include a 
diverse group ot male and female 
university administrators and faculty, 
and a representative from Ihe Fort 
Wayne Women's Bureau.

Students have mixed 
reactions about center 

By MARV POPOVICH 

Staff WHter 

IPFW students and faculty were supportive of the Women's Center However, 

some people questioned fell the center would have lo be directed in the proper 

manner Here's how some feel about the new center: 

— Michelle Bandor, a married student with a five-year-old daughter, said, 
"It's an excellent idea" because "I know so many people who have a hard lime 
juggling their family responsibilities and their school responsibilities." 

As a result, she said, "They ha veto deal with husbands who are irate because 
they're spending a lol of time with school and feeling neglected. " The women, in 
turn, "feel like they're neglecting their children, and they find it hard lo tie il all 
together. 

"I think ... anybody who can help them figure out how to lie the whole 
package together would be great," 

— Peggy Bohde, a married full-time student with two school-age daughters, 
said she often feels the pressures of having multi-responsibilities. Unlike many 
olher women, however, she said she had little trouble adjusting lo her younger 
classmates when she returned to school. 

"1 thought, at first, that aU these younger kidsare going lo think, 'whalislhis 
old woman doing here?' But they've been really nice ... I've just fell prelty 
equal," 

— Lee Person, associate professor of English, said, "I guess there's a need 
forit.Allhoughitseemsas if maybe they 'redoing some thing a little loo special, 
a little loo patronizing. I mean, if it's implying (hat women need special help lo 
adjust lo college lite," 

Although Person said he's "sure that's not the altitude it was conceived in," 
he fell having a women's center could give the impression that "poor lost 
women need some helping hand to lake them by the hand and lead them to 
good." 

Hesaidhewas concerned that "if it becomes loo much a hand-holding sort of 
thing it ... caneasily smack of patronizing. I guess I worry a little bit about the 
stereotyping of a particular group, admittedly a large group " He asked, "Do 
we not need a similar center for men?" 

— Paul Ford, a full-time student who is married and the falher of a three- 
year-old son, said, "II always sounds nice to have another support group, 
because I think people in general need that." 

Ford, who relumed lo school after several years in Ihe work forte, could be 
considered the male counterpart to the student for whom the women's center 
was designed. However, Ford said, "I don't think there's a need lo have liiat 
(sort of place) tor me personally. It's hard lo speak (or other men and what ihey 
need, but it seems like they have different needs than women do."

Recruitment project 
being researched 



By MICHELE R. SHAFFER 

Editor-lD-Chlef 

IPFW is researching Ihe possibihty of 

establishing an international student 

recruitment program, PhilUp Kennell, 

director of admissions, said recently 

"We're looking into Ihe feasibility of 

recruiting inlernational students lo our 

campus and lo provide a support 

system lo them," Kennell said. 

Kennell has taken a 20 percent 
reduction in his work as director of 
admissions loenable him lowork on the 
recruitment program investigation 
which began in mid-October. 

"We used lo just send most of the 
inquiries ( from prospective in- 
ternational students) that came to our 
office lo Lafayette or Bloomington," 
Kennell said. "Now we send them 
response letters," 

Kennell said in the past month he has 
received about 25 inquiries. 

"The key is that we're doing a study 
lo see if the university has the 
resources." Kennell said. "It's not 
going lo be a costly project. To truly be 
a university, IPFW has lo have an 
internaticmal community." 

Kennell said recruiting inlernational 
sludenls lo IPFW would benefit the 
students here in many ways. First of 
all. he said, the American students 
would be in classes and involved in 
extracurricular activities with the 
international students and would be 
working with them each day. "1 think 
we all realize how important it is to 
understand people from other coun- 
tries," he said. 

Kennell said although the department 
has not even been approved yet. he has 
been doing some recruitment of in- 
ternational students already. He said 
he has been in contact with 
Bloomington and West Lafayette to see 
if IPFW could gain some of the students 
that are not admitted into either In- 




PhliUp Kennell 
Director of Admissions 
diana University or Purdue Univer- 
sities. Kennell said il is not thai these 
students are not qualified, but that the 
main campuses have a quota and the 
requests lo attend these schools are 
greater than the maximum number 
they can admit. 

Secondly. Kennell said, he has been 
trying other sources lo Irj' lo reach 
inlernational students and recruit them 
to attend IPFW. He said he has had 
contact with authorities ot a project 
where professors from eight Big Ten 
colleges (including Indiana University) 
travel to Malaysia lo leach sludenls 
there. In this program, the students 
receive an associates' degree in 
general studies and are then assigned 
to colleges in the United Slates as 
juniors continuing their studies.

International recruiting: 
something IPFW needs 



IPFW is currently investigating the 
feasibility of adopting an international 
students admission and recruitment 
program that could be established as 
early as next fall. 

Such a program would bring many 
benefits to the university, not only in the 
form of the obvious — more money 
because students would be paying out-of- 
stale tuition — but in many subtle ways. 

More international students at IPFW 
would lend more of a cultural diversity 
to the campus. More than just, "Hey, 
let's go out this week and see a play." 
Not to undermine the theatre, but there 
is an obvious need on this campus for 
people to learn to appreciate a culture 
besides the one in which they have 
grown up — the heartland of the 
Midwest. Many of the students here have 
never stepped foot outside the tri-slate 
area. Promoting recruitment of 
international students would give the 
students what they need while 
, remaining right here in Indiana. 

The program would encourage 
economic growth today and in the 
future. Last year. In the state o( Indiana 
alone, the 7,133 international students 
spent an estimated $50 million in 
personal expenditures — food, clothing, 
tuition. The basics. It would foster 
economic strength in the future when 
these students return to their countries 



and get jobs. Maybe years from now, 
these same students would be in 
positions to bring foreign business to 
northeast Indiana. 

Another way the program could 
benefit IPFW and its students and 
faculty is that it would help us to 
understand people from foreign 
countries in a different hght. Too often 
we take for truth that which we hear 
about other countries. This goes hand 
hand with the previously mentioned 
of future economic growth. Maybe 
twenty years down the road some of the 
IPFW students will be leaders in 
government and corporations, making 
the decisions about doing business with 
foreign countries and cooperating with 
these same countries in promoting world 
peace. 

The recruitment of international 
students would make IPFW more 
respectable in the eyes of other 
universities and in the minds of students 
contemplating enrolling at IPFW. -- 

This program has the possibility of 
bringing IPFW up to the caliber of 
recruitment that some other universities 
smaller than ours already have. Instead 
of having the students go to Tri-State 
University, Taylor University or Marion 
College, why shouldn't they come here? 

We have much to offer them. And they 
have a lot to offer us. 



Be thankful this year 




Have you ever walked down a busy 
downtown street and saw a bag lady? 
These women carry all their worldly 
possessions with them every day — in a 
shopping bag. 

Many of you will be bringing home 
your Thanksgiving dinner this week — in 
a shopping bag. 

Have you seen the advertisements in 
magazines with the familiar face of 
Sally Struthers asking for you to sponsor 
a starving child? The advertisement 
says it costs a mere 60 cents a day to feed 
a child. 

Most of us will spend about 80 times 
that for food on Thanksgiving — for just 
one day. 

When you go to the grocery store to 
purchase your Thanksgiving turkey this 
week, look on the side of the grocery bag. 
Do you recognize the face of the child 
printed on the side of the bag? 

Be thankful if you don't. 

Be thankful you can enjoy a 
Thanksgiving meal with your family, 
that you have the money to feed your 



family on Thanksgiving Day, and that 
your family is together. 

All families have squabbles now and 
then, and sometimes it is hard to lay 
these arguments aside for even a day. 
But try to do that this year. Think of the 
thousands of families whose tables have 
an empty chair because someone they 
are close to appears on the side of the 
grocery bag or milk carton. 

This Thanksgiving as you gather 
together with your family, try to be 
thankful for what you have. Try to take 
stock of all that you are blessed with in 
life, and remember that material 
possessions are not always what makes 
a person happy. 

Try to remember that the holidays 
are, among other things, a time to 
gather with your family. Somebody once 
said that in their family it did not matter 
that they had less food on the table than 
in past years, but what mattered the 
most was they had each other. 

Be thankful for that, and have a Happy 
Thanksgiving, 



From slugger to heavyweight boxer 



Avoid holiday hassles 



The holiday season is upon us and if 
you're like the average university 
student, your pockets are lined with 
nothing more than old homework 
assignments, car keys, and a few ijalls of 
lint. 

The spring semester at IPPW has the 
nasty habit of falling immediately after 
the holidays. This means, of course, that 
fees are due during the holiday hassle. 
And with tuition costs riiSing almost each 
semester, fee payment really wreaks 
havoc with one's Christmas account. 

What can the stereotypical starving 
student do to alleviate the high cost of 
holidays? The solution is right here. 
printed in the same ink as this. And just 
what solution is this? 

The Communicator advertisers.

The Communicator, offering valuable 
coupons, student discounts and special 
bargains for IPFW students, faculty and 



staff. Everything from record albums 
and balloon bouquets to gourmet 
popcorn and ice cream can be found in 
the adverts m The Communicator. Not 
only can you save on Christmas gifts, but 
you can save on meals at Pizza Hut, 
Wendy's and other area restaurants. 

The advertisers also offer 
employment and educational 
opportunities and resume printing 
among other things. 

Many businesses offer holiday 
specials in The Communicator, such as 
additional discounts, coupons offered 
only in The Communicator, or specials 
advertised on a limited basis. 

So pick up an issue of The 
Communicator and start your gift list

Ever since Rocco was a 
small boy he knew what he 
wanted to do with his life: he 
wanted (o tiecome a major 
league baseball player. 

In playground practice he 
would make his pals pitch to 
him for hours. It was the 
sluggers who made the most 
money, he told Itiem — so he 
must learn to t)e a slugger, 

AU his heroes were the 
heavy hitters: Ruth, Gehrig, 
DiMaggio, Williams, Their 
pictures adorned the walls of 
a clubhouse he shared with 
his young friends. 

In his teen years, Rofxo 

continued to work hard 
toward a baseball career. 
He clayed in neiehborhood 
games whenever he could 
and thought constantly about 
hitting and fielding 
techniques. Such daydreams 
interfered with school and 
practically everything else, 
but Rocco didn't care. He 
was a young man with an 
obsession. Nothing must 
stand in his way. 

In self-styled training, he 
ran upliill to improve his 




base running. He even 
worked out on a set of 
homemade siretching coils 
to strengthen liis chest and 
back arms for batting, A 
slugger. That's what Rocco 
was going to be; they made 
the most money. 

Rocco's dad worked in a 
shoe factory, and oc- 
casionally the boy would 
visit him there. It grieved 
Rocco to see his ailing father 
work so hard. "Don't worry, 
Pa," the youngster would 
say, "When I get to the 
majors I'll make a lot of 
money and you'll never have 
to work again." 



Late in March of 1947 
RoccD headed for Fayet- 
teville, N,C. — the traimng 
campof the farm team of the 

mighty Chicago Cubs, 

By then Rocco had already 
starred in the semipros, and 
he was ready to take the big 
step to the big leagues. 

The competition would be 
ferocious, he'd tieen warned. 
But Rocco was certain of his 
destiny to t)ecome a great 
professional baseball player. 

Even before Rocco arrived 
in Fayetteville, the going got 
tough. It was a long trip and 
he signed in a day late. 



Strike one, 

A few days in camp and his 
arm started hurling. His 
throwing arm. Suddenly it 
tost its snap, and made 
Rocco l«dc awkward playing 
defense. 

Strike two. 

No matter, he thought. He 
was still hitting big. And the 
manager was looking for 
sluaaers, wasn't he? 

Yet unless Rocco hit it out 
of the park, he was in trouble 
— held to a double after a 
sure-triple smash — or to a 
single that ought to have 
been a double — because he 
was simply too big and too 
slow to be a major base 

So Rocco was cut from the 
team, and thus ended his 
lifelong dream. He had 
wanted to become a pro 
baseball player more than 
anything in the world. Now 
he was nobody. 

His companion on the long 
trip home was a buddy, Ray 
Gormley, who had also been 
cut from the roster Rocco 



kept telling Ray that he 
couldn't go back a failure — 
(hat if he couldn't be a 
slugger in baseball, maybe 
he could become his 
manager! 

Ray gave Rocco a sym- 
pathetic pat on the back. 
Rocco was depressed and 
grabbing at straws, Ray 
said. Rocco should jUst go 
hack home — and wallow in 
his pride — and return to his 
real job — at the gas com- 
pany. 

But Rocco did not. 

And that is how a fellow 
named Ray Gormley turned 
down the one e-in-a-life time 
opportunity to become 
manager of one of the 
greatest heavyweight 
champion boxers of all time 
— a heavy hitter named 
Rocco Marchegiano. He was 
to alter his name — to Rocky 
Marciano. 

And that is the rest of the

Age difference causes concern 
in Students' Government plans 



BySTACEYSCHAAB 
SUf I Writer 

The problem is obvious, 
but Ihe solution has proved to 
be far from simple: IPFW 
has a split student body, 
concerning age. 

The university changes 
from day-time to night-time. 
During the day, the younger 
crowd (age 18-2S) attends 
classes, at night the older 
crowd (26 and over) does. 
Students' Government wants 
to bring both age groups 
together for functions. Yet. 
finding the suitable activity 
poses a problem. 



A look at the older crowd of 
people reveals most have 
families and are attempting 
to Tinish their degrees with a 
couple of classes each 
semester. A typical day may 
consist of a 9-5 office job. 
then home for a quick dinner 
before heading to class. 

While on the other hand, 
daytime students spend the 
day at school and have the 
night to do with what they 
desire. 

Different age groups have 
different interests and 
Students' Government has 
been climbing the walls to 



perhaps a women's study "always open tor new 
group. She is. as she says, ideas." 



Women's Center 



(Continued from Page 1) 

"Establishing a womai's 
center on the IPFW campus 
will be an important step 
toward improving 
educational equity for 
women. Because IPFW, as a 
commuter campus-urban 
university, serves large 
numt&gt;ers of n on traditional 
students, a Tirst priority for a 
women's center should be to 
help meet the needs of 
women entering or re- 
entering college after an 
interval of several years, " 
said a report from the task 

'By providing a 'safe.' 
nonlhrealening environment 
for women to discuss 
problems and fears, and by 
referring them to the 
available services on 
campus, the women's center 
could help support the 
recruitment and retention of 
women students," the report 
concluded. 

Taskforceco-chairChnlon 
sees the center as much 
morethan a referral agency, 
however. "I think it's also 
going to serve as a catalyst 



.. for women's programs." 
She envisions it as a place 
where women can meet to 
draw up a variety of 
programs, including guest 
speakers and informal 
luncheons, "to discuss 
particular topics of interest 
to women, such as day car€. 
sexual harassment ... and 
health services, to name a 

Clinton also expects the 
center to sponsor more 
workshops similar to the one 
conducted Nov. 19. "New 
Directions for Women" was 
geared at helping women 
evaluate their personal, 
career, and educational 
goals. Clinton says a second 
workshop is planned for next 
spring to help women 
students. 

The women's center is 
staffed on a part-time basis 
by Middteton as supervisor 
and by three students wtM, 
according to Clinton, are 
"peer counselors, people 
who have been through it 
themselves." : 

Although "the staff n)ay 



change from year to year as 
students change," Clinton 
expects them all to fit the 
description ol the non- 
traditional woman student. 
This is the case, she said, 
with current workers Terri 
Worman, Denise Van Ort, 
and Tina Long 

All three have come 
"highly recommended" to 
the women's center. Clinton 
said, and have been trained 
to assist students in a 
professional manner 
Furthermore, she said, 
because these women have 
"been there," it is felt that 
they will lend a more 
sympathetic ear than might 
be found elsewhere on 
campus, 

Middleton said the 
workers will lend as much 
assistance directly from the 
center as possible, but. "in 
many cases, we will have to 
make some referrals. I'm 
sure. We are not specialists 
in every area," she said. 

For example, if a woman 
is having trouble with child 
care, the workers would 
refer her to the Child Care 



Consortium. Or, if a student 
is in need of more in-depth 
personal counseling, Clinton 
said the workers would refer 
her to Park Center's visiting 
counselor on campus. 

Middleton and Clinton both 
said they recognize the 
importance of taking that 
extra step to help returning 
adult women students. Many 
of them, Clinton says, have a 
very low self-esteem 
because they "have gone 
from the home and high 
school situation to marriage 
and have never had college 
or a job." 

As a result, she notes, "the 
returning woman student 
often feels awkward being in 
a classroom with young 
people, and doesn't know ... 
anyone like herself, or have 
someone to talk to," 

And that is where the 
IPFW women's center hopes 
to come into the picture. As 
Middleton sums up, "the 
center is hoping to relieve 
some of that (anxiety), to 
help them meet those 
problems and be successful 



Reactions 

(Continued from Page I) 
What Ford questioned was 
whether the women's center 
might not be a duplication of 
services on campus. "It just 
seems a little redundant 
because a lot of the services 
are already handled through 
Student Services, I believe." 

— Kathy Schall, who is 
married and a full-time 
student, said the women's 
center "sounds like an in- 
teresting idea." 

"I think it could really 
help, t)ecause a lot of times 
you do feel out of touch ... 
with the generalized student 
body; it seems like 
everyone's just out of high 
school. But when you're 
married and have a family 
and .., a full-time job, it's 
hard to get everything to Tit 
together." 

Schall thinks the center 
could be beneficial to women 
students like herself because 
"you're kind of out there on 

— Kathleen Richards, a 
full-time student and a 
middle-aged, single parent. 
said, "'I had my doubts 
(about the center) at first 
But after talking with the 
Chancellor (Thomas P 



Wallace), I believe he is 
Tirmly committed to the 

success of the women's 
cenierand that he will make 
wtiatever adjustments that 
arc necessary to ensure its 
success," 

Richards said she admired 
the Chancellor's ac- 
cessibility in the matter, as 
well as "his concern for 
issues that affect the 
studenUof IPFW." 

She did express a concern, 
however, that the women 
working at the center might 
not be an accurate 
representation of the women 
on campus. She said, for 
example, that there are no 
racial minorities on the staff, 
and that the current workers 
may be '"too young" for 
many of the "older" students 
to relate to 

"It would be helpful to 
them (o have at their 
disposal the experience of 
one who has already suffered 
the indignities of being a 
displaced homemaker, and a 
returning student." she said. 

The women's center is 
located in Walb G25, which 
formerly was a television 
lounge lor students The TV 
set was moved upstairs into 
the Fireside Lounge. 



One senator suggested the 
importance of involving the 
older student's family. A 
step in the nght direction is 
being taken in the area of 
movies — two children's 
n Ims will t»e shown on Dec. 5 
and Dec. 6, "The Night 
Before Christmas" and "tOl 
Dalmations." The movies 
will be shown in Classroom- 
Medical Building Room 159 
and admission is two people 
for SI (or both shows. 

Both age groups need to 
[eel that they are part of the 
campus and that Students' 
Government is there to serve 
them. A suggestion box will 
be placed in Kettler Hall for 
students to make their ideas 
available to students 
government. 

A Euchre Tournament 
shall l)e held every Monday 
in the Green Room in Walb 
Memorial Union from noon 
to 1:30 p.m. Free refresh- 
ments will be served. 



The athletic center's ex- 
tended hours are now per- 
manent, and Students' 
Government encourages all 
IPFW students to take ad- 
vantage of the lengthened 
hours to work out. 

Students' Government is 
seeking input on a semi- 
formal dance during a 
winter carnival, and 
students with ideas are 
asked to put them in (he 
suggestion box or in the 
Students' Government of- 
fice. Suite 225, o( (he Walb

Recruitment 

(Continued from Paget) 



Kennell said if the 
program is adopted it would 
offer counsehng and ad- 
visinE to students for 
problems unique to in- 
ternational students. Kennell 
cited vicas as being a source 
of conflict for the students, 
especially when it comes to 
vacations for these students. 
Other general problems 
would be cultural ad- 
justment problems, finan- 
cial, housing, transportation 
and msurance problems, 
that the department could 
assist the students with. 
Kennell said the department 
would also do some iniLal 
academic advising as well as 
make sure the students 
enrolling have all the 



necessary requirements to 

being students at IPFW, 

Kennell said the way the 
department is proposed it 
would be part of student 
services, which is directed 
by John Ulmer, dean of 
student services. 

Kennell said he has goals 
in mmd 11 the department is 
approved. He said he would 
like to see the department 
increase the number of in- 
ternational students on I20's 
I student visas ) at a rate of 2S 
a year for the next three 
years to work on degrees at 
IPFW Presently IPFW has 
17 mlernalional student- 
enrolled on student visas, 
Kennell said. 

Kennell said he would 
like to make a Tinal report to 
other administrators by mid- 
January.

Cocaine is popular 




By NATALIE ALCOX 
Features Editor 

There are %,000 ciKaine 
users in Indiana today, 
according to Karen Laux, 
program director at the 
Koala Center 

"We are finding cocaine to 
tie the biggest problem on 
college campuses today," 
she said, "aside from 
alcohol which has always 
been a problem." 

Drug abuse accounts (or 
2.7 million hospital ad- 
missions every year. 4.1 
million people use coke on a 
regular basis. 5,000 people 
Iry cocaine every day and 
eight in 10 of those will 
become addicted, according 
(o Laux.

more accessible and the 
price is going down In 1968 a 
gram of coke cost about f75. 
In 1986 a doseof crack is only 
$10 [0 $20. 

Cocaine stays in a person's 
body (or W-36 hours, "We're 
Tinding." states Laux, "tl)at 
most coke addicts are 
predominantly male." 

Females have their share 
of drug problems, however. 
Women are more likely to go 
to four or five doctors and 
get prescriptions from all o( 
them. Fifty percent of 
prescribed drugs are not 
taken properly. 

For those with a drug or 



alcohol problem help Is 
available. The SL Joseph 
Medical Center Koala Center 
is a location thai addicts or

Reader's Services sponsored 
David Nichols workshop 



By JUDY RAMSEY 

SUff Writer 

Anyone inlerested in 
writing as a career may 
have had second thoughts 
after listening to David 
Niciiols relate how he suc- 
ceeded in getting his book, 
"Ernie's War, The Best of 
Ernie Pyle's World War II 
Dispatches" published. 

Nichols, a local writer and 
editor, conducted a two hour 
workshop on writing 
Saturday, Nov, 8. Reader's 
Services sponsored this 
workshop at the Allen 
County Public Library for 
individuals inlerested in 
writing, editing, resear- 
ching, and publishing. 

Nichols began studying 
journalism while attending 
Bishop Dwcnger High 
School. Doing documen- 
taries and feature articles 
were his favorite types of 
reporting. After graduating 
in 1974, he enrolled at IPFW 
and earned a degree in 
secondary education in 1979. 

After college he worked for 
the Journal Gazette one year 
as a general assignment 
reporter. He terminated his 
employment with the paper

redundani type of work he

local corporate 



Getting published is not an 
easy feat for any writer, and 
this author was no exception. 
He submitted numerous 
articles to various 
magazines and anxiously 
awaited their reply. 
Nichols candidly told his 
audience of the many 
rejections he had received 
through the mail after 
waiting three to six months. 
In some instances, he 
received no reply at all. 

He began working on a 
book about Fort Wayne, a 

fortunately, he was unable to 
find a publisher for it. This 
project was ultimately 
abandoned due to the lack of 
funds. In spite of these 
setbacks, Nichols would not 
give up. Instead, he began 
writing about Ernie Pyle. 

The researching and the 
actual writing of this book 
took Nichols three and a 
half years to complete. He 
divided his days between a 
full-time job. his wife and 
two daughters, and wriUng 
in a tiasement office located 
m the Metropolitan Building. 
He again attempted to sell 
his manuscript to a publisher 
in New York only to receive 
another rejection slip six 
months later 

Studs Terkel, a journalist 
from Chicago, encouraged 
Nichols to ' send his 
manuscript to Candida- 
Do nadio. a literary agency in 
New York. Eric Ashworth

Ahhough practices have been taking place for quite a 
while, ihe season doesn't move into full swing until January 



Tourney opens season

and it's almost time to get 
down to business (or Coach 
Tim Russell and tiis IPFW 
men's l&gt;asketball learn. Ttte 
Mastodons open their season 
Friday at 7 p.m. when they 
lake on Rosary College in the 
first round of the IPFW Tip- 
0(1 tournament SI. Francis 
and Lake Superior Slate will 
hook-upat9p.m inlheother

The consolation game is 
set for 7 p.m. Saturday wtiile 
the championship will follow

to take a long breather as 
Olivet Nazarene comes to 
Fori Wayne for an B p.m. 
match Monday before the 
'Dons travel to nationally- 
ranked Wrighl Stale for a 
730 p.m: contest on Nov. 29- 

"We've told the kids that 
the tournamenl games are 
the two most important 
games of the year,*' Russell 
said. "We're going to have to 
come out and l&gt;e ready to 



play and it's imporlanl we 
play well to set the tone for 
the season." 

Russell got a look at his 
team in action last week 
when Ihe Lafayette Hustlers 
AAU learn handed IPFW an 
80-56 defeat. IPFW was 
paced by Bruce Erwin. 14 
points, and Jim Morlan and 
Richard Ivy, 10 points each. 
Morlan's seven rebounds 
helped IPFW oulrebound the 
Uller Hustlers, 34-29. 

"The game was en- 
couraging from the fact Ihat 
we can go inside and score 
againsl people with more 
size than we have." Russell 
said "II also gave us a lot of 
exposure lo some of the parts 
of our game we need to shore 
up" 

■■Bui, we handled the 
mental side well and we 
weren't intimidated by a 
team with as much in- 
dividual lalenl as they 
display " (article courtesy of 
IPFW Ni.'ws Bureau) 



The leaves are luming up 
their toes and here we are, 
ready for another go-round, 
and I have losay right off the 
top that hoops, buckets, nets, 
roundball — whatever you 
want to call it — it's out of 
sight. 

It's time we stopped 
whipping that aulomatic 
punching bag In Shawnee 
Mission, the NCAA, and put 
the blame on the downside 
problems of college 
basketball — and our 
inability to handle Ihem — 
where it really belongs. I'm 
talking about the problems 
we have now with recruiting 
violations, academics, 
payments under the table, 
student-athletes who aren't 
educated — let's put the 
bli^me for all this right where 
it belongs, in the laps of the 
presidents of the Division I 
universities. 

First off. you must realize 
that these people are a 
unique combination of 
scholar, educator, politician, 
fundraiser. and labor 
negotiator. And that, in 
addition, most are also 
uniquely self -centered. 

Too often, when it comes to 
something important. 
university presidents are loo 
content to play Pontius 
Pilale. washing their hands 
of whatever comes their 

The truth of the matter is. 
the president of the 
university should tie where 
it's at — like the Oval Office 
when Ihe red phone rings. He 




should be the Frank Sinatra, 
the Lee lacocca, the Bruce 
Springsteen He should be 
the boss. 

No university president 
can expect that he can have 
automatic alumni meetings 
every Saturday in the fall 
and on the weekends in 
wintertime, without being 
aware that there are certain 
y esses and ncs Ihat have to 
be answered. Like the idea 
that, somewhere down the 
line, student-alhleles are 
going to have to receive 
some type of financial 
compensation. 

Hey, Ihe world of income- 
producing sports is truly no 
invenlory, no union, no 
pensions — and yet, i^.any of 
these young people so much 
as sell a complimentary 
tickel. il immediately calls 
for the creation of. a com- 
mittee to have Devil's Island 
re-opened. 

What I'm trying to say to 
you presidents of the 
universities is, you don't 
need the commillees. As 
Harry S Truman pul it, the 
buck stops al your desk. 



You're the only one that can 
say. enough is enough. 

You're great at giving a 
tesl. So lei me give one to 

Should freshmen be 
eligible for varsity play? 

Should student athletes be 
given a monthly stipend? 

When there's a need at 
home, a parent's death, 
sickness, or a family 
problem, will the school pay 
for Ihe student-athlete's 
plane ticket? 

Is commercialization of 
undergraduates (or revenue 
acceptable'* 

And Tinally, would you 
explain to your coaches what 
a "representative season" 
is. in relation to wins and 
losses'" 

I'm going lo say il once 
again: The people who 
should answer tor these 
problems are not the guys at 
Ihe NCAA, because ihey 
work al Die pleasure of the 
presidents of the univer- 
sities The presidents should 
decide the policies 

Hey guys, come out from 
t»ehind your desks. You're 



the only person in the stable, 
11 doesn't make any dif- 
ference what Ihe jockey 
says, what the trainer says, 
what the groom says, or even 
whal Ihe horse says. You 
own the stable. You should 
set the rules. You have the 
authority to put respon- 
sibility in the proper area of 
your athletic departments. 

For example: If we claim 
that we have the best 
faculties In the world al our 
universities, then wtiy is il so 
difricult lo educate a person 
who gels a 650, rather than a 
700, on his SAT's? If it's Ihat 
difficull, then I ihink we'd 
t&gt;etter start checking on the 
ability of our faculty. Or are 
we ihere lo educate or just lo 
educate the educated? 

To sum up, I'd say, college 
presidents, make decisions. 
Make 'em even if they are 
unpopular. It's time for 
hardball. 

So far, you've been content 
to pul Ihe spotlighl on the 
wrong people — the athletic 
departments, the coaches, 
the student athletes. They're 
not in charge. And yet, you'd 
want everybody lo believe 
it's them who have egg on 
their face. 

Come on, you presidents. 
Come oul and say what you 
want The NCAA answers to 
you. If you guys have ttte 
courage to say il shouldn't 
be, then it won't be ... But it's 
lime, on the above men- 
tioned questions, for you to 
take charge of your own 
destiny inside Ihe jock world.
