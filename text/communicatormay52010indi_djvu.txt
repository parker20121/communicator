The Fine Line Between a Helping Hand and Sexual Harassment 



Students and teachers share a close bond throughout the semesters, though 
most often it is only a bond that is made through education. Sometimes, that 
bond can be misread or abused, and turn into a case of sexual harassment. 
The Mi ma m- Webster dictionary defines sexual harassment as "uninvited 
or unwelcome verbal or physical behavior of a sexual nature especially by a person in 
authority toward a subordinate."

Indiana Happenings

Indy high school questions 
Toni Morrison book 

INDIANAPOLIS — Students at a suburban 
Indianapolis high school had to turn in a Nobel Prize- 
winning novelist's book they had been reading for 
class after a parent complained that its content was 
inappropriate. 

Franklin Central High School officials said they 
were reviewing Toni Morrison's "Song of Solomon," 
which had been assigned to about 50 juniors in two 
advanced-placement English classes. 

Franklin Township School Board member Scott 
Vecrkamp said he and another board member had 
received complaints from a parent about the book, 
then asked school administrators to pull it from the 
classes. 

Veerkamp said there were depictions of sex, 
profanity, demeaning language and suicide in the 
book that he found offensive, 

"I was about as appalled as I've ever been in my 



life," he told The Indianapolis Star. "I wouldn't want 
to expose my children to that garbage." 

Franklin Central Principal Kevin Koers said copies 
of the book were collected from students Wednesday. 
He said he was reading the book and would talk with 
the teachers and others as he hoped a decision could 
be reached on it by Monday. 

"There is a lesson in the book," Koers said. "The 
teachers are very adamant in how they do their work. 
They are upfront with the students as to why (some 
material) is in it." 

Morrison won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1993 
for work that included "Song of Solomon," which tells 
the story of a black man's attempts to unravel the 
mystery of his family's past. 

loan Benin, executive director of the New York 
City-based National Coalition Against Censorship, 
said objections have been raised before to the 
teaching of Morrison's novels in schools. 

"With sophisticated literature like Toni Morrison 
novels, we tend to get parents who think their 
children should be protected from the very difficult 
life situations that these books portray." Benin said. 

Franklin Township School Board President Steve 
Randall said he was concerned about the book's 
graphic material but that the district needed time for 



a complete review. 

"I think you have to let administrators do their 
jobs," Randall said. 

Indiana ranks 3rd for census 

INDIANAPOLIS — State officials said Indiana's 78 
percent rate of returning census forms is among the 
highest in the nation. 

The Indiana Department of Administration said 
mail-in results released Wednesday show Indiana tied 
with Iowa. The two states trailed only Wisconsin and 
Minnesota, which both hit 80 percent. The national 
rate was 72 percent. 

Census-takers will begin going door-to-door 
Saturday to count remaining people. Census-takers 
must present an ID badge that contains a Department 
of Commerce watermark. If asked, census-takers 
should provide contact information for their 
supervisor or local census office for verification. 

Census-takers should only ask the questions that 
appear on the census form. They should not ask for 
Social Security numbers or bank account or credit 
card numbers.

How Casual is too Casual?

According to a study by 
the American Association of 
University Women (AAUW1, 
62 percent of women in 
college have been sexually 
harassed on campus. Clearly. 
sexual harassment is not only 
a woman's problem, though, 
as that statistic is closely 
followed by 61 percent of 
men. Even more, 66 percent 
of college students in 
general know someone who 
had been harassed. Sadly, 
the statistics also showed 
that only 10 percent of the 
victims reported any of their 
experiences to the university. 

As explained in the 
department anti-harassment 
and non-discrimination 
policy of IPFW's handbook, 
"It is the policy of Purdue 
University to maintain the 
campus as a place of work 
and study for faculty, staff. 
•mil students free from all 
Forms of harassment and 
discrimination, hi providing 
an educational and work 
climate that is positive and 
harassment free, faculty, 
staff, and students should 
be aware that harassment 
and discrimination in the 
workplace or educational 
environment is unacceptable 
conduct and will not be 
tolerated ." 

Former IPFW student. 
Ashley Myers, said that she 
was not sure if one of her 
instructors was pushing 
the boundaries of being 
too dose. Most of what she 
encountered was non-verbal 



and could have just been 
communication errors, but 
Myers still found herself 
unable to concentrate in 
class. 

"It got to the point where 
I would just sleep the whole 
class," Myers said, adding 
dial it was easier to sleep 
than it was to put up with 
everything. 

Similarly, AAUW stated 
that 16 percent of female 
college students who had 
been sexually harassed had 
trouble studying or paying 
attention in their class. 

On the other hand, IPFW 
student Austin Gray said 
that he saw a good example 
of impartial treatment from 
one of his instructors. A 
person had suggested to 
the instructor of a media 
class that they go see a 
movie along with a couple 
of other students. Instead of 
just restricting those going 
to a couple of people from 
the class, (he instructor 
prompdy invited everyone 
to join. 

Gray said that he was 
not able to make it to the 
screening, "but posting that 
made it a really cool class trip 
for all of us together and for 
anyone who wanted to hang 
out outside of die normal 
class lime.' 

So. when everything is 
said and done, there may 
not be a clear-cut difference 
between "close" and "too 
close," but everything relies 
on a students ability to feel 
comfortable in their school 
environment. If that comfort 
is disrupted, it is time to 
contact a school official.

Well, first we'd be careful not lo characterize it as 
a date, because we all know what kinds of thoughts 
that can lead to. But your question is a good one. We 
can't emphasize enough how important it is to just 
act the way you're most comfortable acting when 
you're spending time with someone, be it the first 
time or the hundred and first. Whether it was because 
you were raised to act with chivalry or you just get 
pleasure out of doing what you consider nice "little" 
things for someone else, it's a part of who you are. 
And that's what needs to shine when you're spending 
time with someone. 

We were discussing this the otherday, actually, and 
Bernadette has a great way of looking at the issue of 
holdingdoors.Toher, it's simply an acknowledgement 
that you are present enough to recognize and value 
the people around you. It's like saying, "Hey, I see that 
you're in my world, I'd like to make it a little more 
pleasant for both of us." It's hard to find fault with it 
when you look at it that way. 

Still, there may be people in the world who look 
upon certain acts unfavorably, and you know what 
the best way to find out if the person you're spending 
time with is one of them? Communicate. In this case, 
though, we think your best bet is just to go with what 



you think is nice and let go of any expectations or 
worries about how the other person will react. They 
may find it polite and charming, they may hate it, 
or they may have no opinion about it one way or 
another. As long as you're doing things that express 
who you are as a person, and are willing and open to 
understanding the other person's perspective, then 
even if it's a problem it's only going to give the two of 
you a reason to explore the connection between you 
even further. 

When does "refusing to settle" become 
"being too picky?" 

--Eric, Indiana 

This is such a common question because the 
answer seems tricky, though really it's pretty simple 
once you change the way you're thinking about how 
you spend time (i.e., not dating). This question is 
all about the phantom structure and timeline of the 
relationship that you've built up in your head. You 
don't have to figure out everything all at once and 
upfront! 

If you're spending time with people you enjoy, 
and there's no place you would rather be than doing 
what you're doing with the person or people you're 
doing it with, then why do you need to knowanything 
else? The grass is always greener on the other side, 
and as we've been conditioned to believe that there's 
a perfect way of doing everything if we can just 
discover it, people are having a hard time making 
decisions and sticking to them. But there are never 
guarantees, especially in matters of the heart, so if 
your life is being enriched by someone, how can that 
ever be considered "settling?"

OPINION 



P. 5 




By Robin Crowell 

loWnywjrgfJvFCgiMlUoiTI 



Through all of the excitement 
in my life lately with the move to 
Portland, I've sort of forgotten to 
leave behind a bit of advice for all of 
you that ate still going to be stuck in 
this black hole of a town. 

For one, it is important to 
remember the people that surround 
you. Though I loathe Fort Wayne 
with every fragment of my being, 
the people that have come around 
over the years are what have made 
this town bearable for so long. If 
you decide to leave, remember the 
importance of keeping in contact 
with the people who mean the world 
to you. Even if you are 2500 miles 
away, those people will always, 
ALWAYS be there for you and this is 
important not to forget. 

Along those same lines, the 
importance of family truly comes 
into play. As many of you know, 
the last five months I have been 
sleeping from couch to couch, living 
out of a book bag and a garbage bag 
full of clothes. I have barely had the 
chance to be around my family. My 
boyfriend traveled to Portland last 
week to work his new job before we 
drove out there and he left me his 
car for the week. This allowed me 
to spend some much needed time 
with my family and it granted me 
the chance to really show them how 
much I appreciated them. I woke 
up at 6:30 each morning to have 
breakfast with my little sister before 
she went off to school. Have I been 
immensely exhausted? Hell yeah 
I have, but every sleep deprived 
moment was worth these little 
breakfast gatherings. 

Another thing, instead of 
complaining all of the time; make 
the best of your surroundings. 1 



know that Fort Wayne does not have 
much to offer, but this is in part 
because of the lack of enthusiasm of 
its inhabitants. The town is trying, 
it really is. Embrace this instead of 
complaining about it. 

While at school, please try to 
make yourself available to people. 
This is one thing that I have learned 
over the course of the past two 
semesters. Even spmething as 
simple as documenting the goings 
on at the smoke hut has allowed me 
to be a more open, receptive person 
to the individuals around me. I have 
made several new friends because 
of this place and, even if you don't 
smoke, you can find something 
similar. I have taken away so much 
knowledge because of these people 
and, still, I know that these are 
friends that 1 am going to keep. 

If you have no family, if you have 
no friends, and if you do not want 
to embrace campus life in any facet 
what so ever, pick up a hobby. I did 
all of the above and still maintained 
a hobby — writing, and I was able to 
publish my first zine despite all of 
the bitterness that I was feeling over 
the past several months. 

Honestiy, living in Fort Wayne 
taught me a lot of things that 1 
could probably have never learned 
elsewhere. If this is the town that 
you plan on staying in for the rest of 
your life, I kind of feel sorry for you. 
[f your plans to leave have fallen 
through (I am no stranger to this), 
then I feel your pain and one day, 
I promise, you will find a way out. 
But, until then, you have to HAVE 
TO make the best out of what you 
are allotted. As the cliche" stands, if 
there's a will, there's a way. There is 
always a way, no matter how long 
it takes to find it. It will happen for 
you. Patience, friends, family and 
optimism in die end will get you 
through the day. Never forget this.

Book into a Movie: King Solomon's Mines be&lt; 



By Holly Gallaway 

gal IhaO 1 Oi lu de nls.lpfw.cd u 



With the end of the semester drawing near, I decided to be a 
little more creative and do a compare and contrast between a book 
and a series of movies. While the book and the movies are not 
directly connected, they have been compared fairly often since 
the release of the movies. The book is King Solomon's Mines by 
H. Rider Haggard. The movies are that of the Indiana Jones series. 

The book takes place in Europe, starting on a ship. It follows 
the journey of three men (Quatermain, Sir Henry, and Captain 
Good] to the mountains of Africa, through the desert, to find the 



mysterious diamond mines of King Solomon. Along the way, around the world in search of legends such as the Holy C 
they find a man who went in search of the mines centuries earlier the Ark of the Covenant when he's not teaching at a prt

the map he created with his own blood and 
a part of his shirt. (The map was taken by the 
man's slave and returned to his family) After 
meeting an indigenous tribe, pretending to 
be gods, and restoring the rightful king (who 
just happens to be their companion) to the 
throne, the three men manage to find Solomon's diamond mines.

ROBIN'S REVIEWS 



By Robin Crowell 

rq binyo jrg r a .^C gnu il .com 



2010 has already proven to be an 
amazing year in music, but I'm not 
going to be around to document the 
rest of its releases for the fine readers of 
The Communicator. Here is a list of the 
albums that I am most anticipating for 
the next few months and a few that I have 
already reviewed that have been favorites 
of mine. I hope music enthusiasts all 
around will check these out and enjoy 



them as much as I hopefully will. 

1] The Hold Steady Heaven is 
Whenever 

The Hold Steady is one of those bands 
that just makes you feel classic. For 
those long summer drives with nothing 
else to do but listen to music with your 
friends, this release will more than likely 
be perfect. Look for this album on May4. 
2) Bad Religion 30 Years Live 
Bad Religion is a band that has been 
through Hell and back, making music 
for thirty yeais now. This release is a 
compilation of live material that has been 



recorded over the years. Anybody with 
an appreciation for punk rock in general 
would be interested in picking this up. 
Look for this release on May 18. 
3) Blacklist Royals Semper Liberi 
I haven't really gotten into this band 
until recently, but boy do they kick ass. 
I'm excited to experience this album 
as one of my first as I begin to establish 
myself out west. This band has rhythm, 
flow, excitement, and lyrics that can make 
you think twice. A preview of this album 
is available on MySpace. Look for it on 
May 25. 



4) Against Me! White Crosses 

As one of my favorite band-. Against 
Me! can do no wrong. Though fans were 
not very receptive of their last release New 
Wave, I still hail it as one of my favorite 
albums and I am sure that Whits-Crosses 
will supersede it. They have followed 
a natural progression to what they are 
today, and this album will probably be 
one of my favorites of the year. It comes 
out on June B. 

5) OffWith Their Heads In Desolation

°"' all while, wealthy men. This is where 

the comparisun begins. Race is viewed 

differently and similarly in the two stories. 

In Haggard's novel, the companions hire 
t races to be their sen ants. While they treat them as 
? only civilized people portrayed in the novel are the 
len on the expedition. The Africans are portrayed as 
ith very little conception of military technology. Also, 



there is only one main woman in the novel and she is portrayed as 
a crazy, blood-thirsty witch. In the Indiana Jones movies, women 
are almost always portrayed as comic reliefs that end up being 
of some small use. While people of other races are portrayed as 
heathens, they are not portrayed as ignorant heathens. They do 
not believe Indiana Jones is a god, they simply know he is capable 
of helping them. 

These are just a few of the comparisons lhat come up time 
after lime. While there are many more, there is not time to tackle 
them right now. If you're an Indiana Jones fan, this book is a good 
one to checkout.

6) The Gaslight Anthem American 
Slang 

Though this is a band that has 
gotten a lot of beef for being a 'ripoff', 
1 personally do not see them this way. 
They pay tribute to the bands that 
inspired them and will continue to do so 
with a 1950s swaggering vocal style and 



music immensely reminiscent of Bruce 
Springsteen. American Slang will steal 
my heart as much as their last release The 
'59 Sound did. Expect this album on tune 
15.

From the moment I heard my first 
Alkaline Trio song, 1 was sold on Matt 
Skiba's vocals and lyrics. Demos is a full

IBFMV) came into the music 
scene in 2003, bringing with 
them some insane melodic 
metal. This third album 
seems to be a fusion of the 
first 2 albums, 77ie Poison and 
Scream Aim Fire. The guitar 
riffs are amazing and keep a 



fast paced tempo in almost 
every song. To keep up with 
the aggressive metal slatus 
the double bass makes you 
feel like the bumper of your 
car might fall off. The vocals, 
however, are slightly different 
than previous albums of the 
past. Matthew Tuck, vocalist 
of BFMV, changed his style 
slightly by bringing to the 
album a smoother sound. 
There is still plenty of well 
known and loved hardcore 
screaming, but the new vocal 
melodies are strong and as 
powerful. This album isn't 
breaking any barriers, but it 
seems to be good and solid 
for those who already know 
this Aggressive Metal band.

Facebook Games Review: Farmville &amp; Mafia Wars 



ByAlexAxthelm 

ailhamO 1 eitudtfiU.tpfw.HJu 



Anybody who has used Facebook for more than 
half an hour has realized that Facebook games are 3 
common pari of the experience. Many users simply 
choose to block these games from their news feeds, 
because some of them update quite frequently. How- 
ever, there must be something that keeps drawing 
people to these games, so I investigated two of the 
most popular games on Facebook, FarmVille and 
Mafia Wars. This is my journal of 5 days with Face- 
book games. 




Monday 9: 19pm 

Unblocked FarmVille and Mafia Wars from my ac- 



Set up Mafia Wars account. Invited friends to "join 
my mafia." "Did jobs." Not entirely certain of what I 



did. Eventually ran out oF energy. Not entirely certain 
why. At this point the entire game seems to revolve 
around clicking a button repeatedly until a meter fills 
up, and then clicking another button. 

Moved onto FarmVille. Followed the introductory 
tutorial. Harvested crops. Planted crops. Was told to 
return tomorrow. 

Tuesday 5:55pm 

Met with a friend, Andrew Murphy, who helped 
me figure out the Mafia Wars interface. He intro- 
duced mc to his strategy which is. "to add stat points 
to energy, so I can do more jobs and level up faster." I 
learned about job tiers, fighting other mafias, and the 
inventory system. Despite knowing how to navigate 
the interface, I am still confused as to what different 
items do, and how they benefit me. 

Tuesday 11:29pm 

Played Mafia Wars, sticking to doing jobs, and 
fighting my friends. I lose repeatedly. 1 use up all my 
energy and stamina in about 5 minutes. 

In FarmVille, I Won 30 coins in a raffle I never en- 
tered, and planted some new plots, with some wheat, 
and peanuts. 

1 am increasingly annoyed at how often I had to 
tell the games that I don't want to share things on my 
wall. 1 did finally cave in, and shared on my wall that 
I needed neighbors for FarmVille. 

Wednesday 10:18pm 

Acquired a property in Mafia Wars. Game was run- 
ning horribly slowly, so that's all I did tonight. 

Getting the hang of FarmVille. Visited a neighbors 
farm, and felt woefully inadequate when comparing 
the amount of stuff my farm to his. 

Saw a polar bear cub available for sale for my 
farm. Not entirely certain why somebody would want 
a polar bear on their farm. I don't think they contrib- 



ute to the overall score. Scoring system of FaimVille is 
still unclear. I don't know if I am winning or not.

Thursday, 9:33pm 

Have fallen into a routine in Mafia Wars. Fight my 
friends, do some jobs, loot some houses. Rinse, re- 
peat. 

Unexpectedly, a staple of the RPG genre appears: 
Boss fights. This may be shaping up to be a real game 
after all. 

Completed boss fight. Never mind. There is no 
significant difference between a boss fight and the 
rest of the game. This game is becoming tedious. I 
don't even bother reading the text of the jobs I'm do- 
ing any more. It doesn't matter whether I'm robbing a 
warehouse or stealing a car. All I have to do is click a 
generic button, and the progress meter goes up. 

On the Farm, I set up more plots of peanuts. A 
quick turnaround which nets me a fair profit. I've 
filled all my plots with peanuts now, because they al-

STUDENT ISSUES 



P. 9 



More than half a century after leaving 
college, student set to graduate next week 



From Page 8

Sixty-five years ago, Richard Camp- 
bell sailed across (he Pacific Ocean 
aboard a Navy destroyer just after the 
United Slates dropped the atomic 
bomb on Japan. 

Next week, the 82-year-old will walk 
across the stage to receive his bach- 
elor's degree in general studies. 

Campbell calls his experiences 
leading up to his college graduation an 
"interesting life." 

Since World War II veterans were not 
required lo finish college before enter- 
ing law school, he went to college for 
the three required years then enrolled 
at American University in Washington 
and graduated in 1954. To make money 
as a student, he worked as an elevator 
attendant in the U.S. Senate office and 
took political-power giants including 
Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon 
and lohn H Kennedy to their floors. 
As an attorney, Campbell specialized 
in administrative law and represented 
major mining and water corporations. 

After a heart attack and about 20 
angioplasties forced him to reduce his 
stress level and retire from his law prac- 
tice in 1994, Campbell started taking 
classes at UNR in 2001. 

Although he was not pursuing a de- 
gree, the accomplishment makes his 
life's theme — "been there, done that" 
— even more appropriate. 

He said his friends joke: "What's a 
matter with you?" Campbell smiles and 
replies that he's trying to delay senility. 

"He brought a depth of knowledge 
and maturity to the class that students 
otherwise wouldn't have," Kevin Ste- 
vens, an associate history professor 
who taught Campbell in three classes, 
said. "He has a perspective on life that 
comes with age and with maturity. One 
of the advantages of having him in class 
is he can raise questions, points of view 
and ideas that otherwise wouldn't have 
been raised because, simply, other stu- 
dents that are 16 to 20 years old don't 
have his experience." 

Campbell's broad life experiences 
include opening a law firm with former 
Nevada Gov. Grant Sawyer and han- 
dling the estate of prominent philan- 



thropist Donald Reynolds after Reyn- 
olds' death. 

Since his days as an attorney, Camp- 
bell has seen the growth of technology, 
which now gready impacts his learning 
experience. As a lawyer, Campbell used 
a typewriter and his secretary manually 
copied documents. He used the library 
often and did not have a cell phone. 

Although using a cell phone is still a 
bit tricky for Campbell, he hardly ever 
goes to the library now and instead 
uses Internet research and has even 
taken several online classes. 

"My memory is not very good," he 
said. "If I study too far in advance, I'll 
forget everything. Being able to come 
here and compete with young people is 
important to me." 

Campbell has enjoyed university 
classes so much that he plans to con- 
tinue taking about two classes per se- 
mester in subjects pertaining to his- 
tory, geography and astronomy, which 
are some of his favorites. Next fall, he 
hopes to even take a philosophy course 
with one of his grandsons, who will be 
starting at UNR as a freshman. 

"The degree doesn't mean I'm going 
to stop," Campbell said. "I'm going to 
keep going." 



low me to check my account once per 
day and maintain a steady income. Still 
not entirely sure what the purpose of 
the game is. 

Friday 9:36pm 

Decided to quit Mafia Wars. This 
game is just not sufficiently entertain- 
ing to continue playing. I Could not 
find a way to remove my account and 
decided instead to simply stop play- 
ing. Unbookmarked the game, and re- 
blocked it on my profile. 

Friday 1 J :54pm 

Expanded farm. Added chickens 
and chicken coop. Decided to contin- 
ue playing despite my experiment of- 
ficially ending. I finally discovered how 
FarmVille works. It's not about win- 
ning, or having a more impressive farm 
than everybody else, because it's all 
subjective. I just need to make a farm 
that I am happy with. 



FarmVille is a better experience. I 
didn't have any of die server problems 
that I did with Mafia Wars, and the bet- 
ter graphics make for a more enter- 
taining game. There is more substance 
to the game too. There is more choice 
thatn simply choosing which of the 
jobs to do next. There are choices to be 
made as far as which crops to harvest, 
and how the land should be used. In 
fact, the game is fun enough that I've 
decided to continue playing. 

At the beginning of the week, I 
thought that both games were use- 
less wastes of time that simply clut- 
tered up peoples newsfeeds. Over the 
course of the week, I discovered that 
these games can be a good way to in- 
teract with other friends that play the 
game, and reconnect with friends that 
I haven't talked to in a long time.

Above: Sophomore Cassie Wolfe hit her third 
home run of the series, ninth of the season. 



IPFW pitcher Courtney Cronin threw her 
11th shutout of the season, and 16th of her ca- 
reer, as the Mastodons took the win this past Sat- 
urday 3-0 against 1UPU1. 

IPFW owned up to seven hits for the game as 
sophomore Cassie Wolfe sent the sphere flying 
over the wall making that her ninth homer of the 
season. 

The 'Dons were able to score first as Amber 
Pierce opened the inning with a single to left 
field, and was advanced to second by Kristina 
Karpun. On a base hit by Sara Hopwood, Pierce 
was able to touch home plate. 

The Mastodons added a pair of runs in the 
top of the sixth inning when Wolfe hit her third 
home run of the series, and ninth of the season, 
driving home herself and Cronin, who hit a two- 
out single to start the rally. 

The win ends the currently scheduled regu- 
lar season for IPFW, as the team has clinched a 
spot in the Summit League Tournament in Far- 
go, North Dakota, hosted by North Dakota State 
University. 

IPFW improved their record to 26-17 on the 
season and 15-6 in the conference.

Stepping up into a little white box and letting 
someone throw a baseball right towards you at 
upwards of eighty miles per hour takes some guts. 
Most guys 1 know would just close their eyes, swing 
and pray the ball hits the bat and not them. This 
isn't the case for IPFW slugger ShaunVanDriessche. 
Over the weekend, VanDriessche belted his twelfth 
home run out of the stadium, giving him the single 
season home run record. This is just another land- 
mark for VanDriessche as he already holds the all 
time home run record at IPFW. This is just icing on 
the cake. VanDriessche has torn the cover off the 
ball all season for the Dons, and its getting even 
hotter heading into the homestretch of the season. 



Over the weekend, IPFW dropped three out of 
four games to conference rival Oral Roberts Univer- 
sity, including a 34-10 loss in game one of a dou- 
ble-header on Saturday. During that first game was 
the homer that sent VanDriessche over the record. 
Pulling it together for the next game, IPFW notched 
a win 9-7 over the same team that beat them down 
just a few hours before. Unfortunately, that would 
be the only win for the Dons' over the weekend, as 
they would drop the next two games 15-4, and 13-5. 
IPFW takes a long road trip way out west to South- 
ern Utah University Friday, May 7 for four games in 
two days before heading back home May 12 for a 
single game against Buder University.
