Event raises $1000 
for scholarship 



Tbe IPFW Alumni Association raised SI000 
for a scholarship to aid the spouse of an aJummis 
or alumna to aiicnd IPFW. 

The scholarship money was raised through 
ticket donations for river-loi parking during ihe 
July 4 fireworks display at Allen County 
Memorial Coliseum, 

In the past, IPFW has allowed the public to 
use all i is parking lots for free during the July 4 
fireworks celebration. 

This year, however, the association charged 
$5 per car and $10 per camper (o park in its lots 
located along ihe river. 

Parking in other campus lots remained free. 

The event was run by alumni volunteers who 
sold tickets, directed traffic and worked conces- 
sion stands. 

The river- lot parking opened at 10 a.m. 



What does it take to be a 
vice chancellor? 



Many dues-paying IPFW alumni members 
used a free-parking coupon offered (in the alumni 
association's newsletter) as a gesture of thanks for 
their support of IPFW and alumni events. 

"We received many positive comments about 
ihe event," said Alumni Director Jennifer Bosk. 
"Many expressed how much they appreciated the 
traffic control in ihe parking lot." 

"The IPFW Alumni Association ihanks ihe 
Fort Wayne community for its support of our 
fundraising effort We are delighted that we can 
give this S1000 scholarship to help someone 
attend IPFW," Bosk continued.

Life-saving devices now 
available to police officers 



Bloominglon, Ind.-- When police get to the 
scene of a cardiac arrest before emergency techni- 
cians do, which is what usually happens, is there 
something in addition to cardiopulmonary resus- 
citation (CPR) that an officer can do to increase 
the victim's chances of survival? 

Tbe Kranncrt Institute of Cardiology ai the IU 
School of Medicine is studying one possibility by 
training and equipping participating officers in 
five Indiana counties with portable automated 
external defibrillators (AEDs) to revive cardiac 
arrest victims. 

So far, two persons have been successfully 
revived by this method, and other counties are 
expressing interest in participating. 

This has been done elsewhere in the nation, 
but it's a new procedure in Indiana. 

An AED automatically analyzes the victim's 
heart rhythm, chooses the right amount of elec- 
tricity to deliver, and then "coaches" the police 
officer through the process with sound and visual 
prompts. 

Sudden cardiac arrest is the leading cause of

Susan B. Hannah has been named 
interim vice chancellor of academic 
affairs. 

Hannah will replace current vice 
chancellor Fenwick English who 
resigned in early June to take a teaching 
position at the University of Iowa. 

She has more than 1 5 years of expe- 
rience as an administrator in higher 
education. 

Hannah has an extensive academic 
career, during which sbe has won sever- 
al awards. 

See Hannah Facts, at right. 

Hannah has followed ber education 
with an active and successful career in 
teaching, administration and research. 

She has taught numerous courses in 
both undergraduate and graduate stud- 
ies, including state and local govern- 
ment, judicial process and behavior, 
public administration, administration 
theory, human-resources administration 
and research design. 

Hannah has also done extensive 
research in the areas of citizen partici- 
pation, decision -making, city charters, 
political economy, higher-education 
policy-making and conflict resolution. 

Hannah is active outside in other 
areas as well, 

In the past, she has presented semi- 
nars and workshops on negotiation 
skills, local government and higher edu- 
cation and public policy. 

She is widely published in numer- 
ous journals, including the "Journal of 
Higher Education," "Productivity and 
Management Review," and "National 
Civic Review". 

An advocate for academics, Hannah 
is a member of the grant-writing and 
governance committee of "Building 
Bridges between the University and 
Nonprofit Community," a S400.000 
grant program sponsored by the 
Kellogg Foundation. 

Hannah also secured $160,000 at IU 
Kokomo for enhancing retention activi- 



death in the United States, striking about 1000 
Americans every day. 

Whether victims survive depends on how 
quickly they are dcfibrillated. 

The shorter the time from collapse to defibril- 
laiion, the better the chances of survival. 

If defibrillation is delayed for more than ten 
minutes, survival rates drop to almost zero. 

Preliminary results from the Krannen study 
indicate that police officers arrive at the scene an 
average of four minutes sooner than emergency 
personnel. 

Giving police AED capability may help 
improve the rate of survival from cardiac arrest in 
Indiana, which is close to the national average of 
less than five percent. 

Other parts of the country with similar AED 
programs have achieved survival rates of thirty to 
fony-five percent.

lo participate, call Mary Newman, research coor- 
dinator, at 317-630-7145. 



tics and helped to fund a citizen satis- 
faction survey with the city of 
Kalamazoo through grants. 

Active in state-level public admin- 
istration, Hannah was appointed to the 
Michigan Higher Education Assistance 
Authority from 1991-94 by Governor 
John Englcr. 

The Authority is responsible for 
managing Michigan's financial aid pro- 
grams and guaranteeing all student 
loans in the state. 

Furthermore, she chaired the 
Michigan Higher Education Institute 
from 1990-92, which studies higher- 
education issues in Michigan. 

At Western Michigan, Hannah 
directed the successful accreditation of 
the School of Public Affairs and 
Administration and established the 
Nonprofit Leadership and 
Administration Program. 

She also coordinated the Graduate 
Certificates in Health Care 
Administration and organized the uni- 
versity's first weekend college. 

At IU Kokomo, she was instrumen- 
tal in the reorganization and implemen- 
tation of changes in the university's aca- 
demic advising and support programs. 

She also led grant-writing efforts to 
augment retention activities. 

According to Dean of Health 
Sciences James Jones, "She has a 
wealth of experience. It's a difficult 
position to step into, but I think she'll 
do just fine." 

Jones also said that Hannah met 
with a group of deans and presented her 
administrative and academic experi- 
ence. 

According to Jones, Hannah will be 
meeting with each school's dean to ask 
their plans for the coming year. 

She then intends to work on a plan 
to coordinate the schools' plans, Jones 
added. 

Irene Walters, director of university 
relations and communications, echoed 
thai sentiment, adding, "The chancellor 
feels good about her appointment. We 
look forward io_having her on board." 

Frank Borelli, vice chancellor of 
student affairs, added, "I'm looking for- 
ward to working with her."

Summer contact lens care 



Bloominglon, Ind.- Swimmers can 
wear soft contact lenses in the pool 
without loosing them, but the lenses are 
likely to become contaminated by bac- 
teria in the pool water. 

That could cause an eye infection, 
according to Santa Soni, co-director of 
the Borish Center for Ophthalmic 
Research in the IU School of 
Optometry. 

To prevent infection, swimmers 



should wait a half hour after getting out 
of the pool and then remove their con- 
tacts and disinfect them, she said. 

Before they get into the pool, 
swimmers should splash some of ihe 
pool water into their eyes so their lens- 
es will encounter the same water both in 
iheir eyes and in the pool. 

Normally that will make the lenses 
adhere to the eyes better and stay in pla- 
ce, she said. 



Those who are swimming in fresh 
water at a beach should follow the same 
procedure before and afier swimming. 

Soni said sail water swimmers 
might lose their contacts because salt 
waler will make the lenses expand and 
perhaps float off the eye more easily. 

"If you swim in sail water with your 
coniacts on, keep your eyes closed 
whenever your face is underwater," she 
said.

house or ski resort," says Susan 
Greenberg, Director of Peterson's 
International Services. 

"College students are interested in 
earning credits at the same time they 
are benefitiing from an adventure holi- 
day. Greater numbers of individuals are

ing precious lime away from the work- 
place," Greenberg added.

tion of interesting and different holi- 
days. Instead, il is aboul the fastest- 
growing segment in the travel 
busincss-the brave new and mind- 
expanding world of learning vaca- 
tions," says Peter S. Greenberg.

ihe NBC Today Show, syndicated 
columnist for the Los Angeles Times 
and author of the book's forward.

Three Rivers 

Festival: 

Was it 

always this 

lame 

or 

have we just 

grown up? 



As we look through the guide 
for this year's 30th Annual Three 
Rivers Festival, we cannot feel that 
there is much to offer for people 
under age thirty who arc interested 
in things other than going to beer 
tents. 

Sure, there are some things like 
96.3 The Extreme's "Extreme in the 
Park," the Sony Exhibit in the park, 
and possibly a few others. 

There aren't really a whole lot of 
things for people in their 20s and 
30s to do. 

It seems as if all of the events are 
geared to either kids or adults over 
thirty 

There are things for people lo 
learn, but there aren't too many 
things that people our age are inter- 
ested in. 

One of the events that pretty 
much people o( any age could enjoy, 
the WMEE Raft Race, was pulled 
this year by the radio station. 

Actually, most of the partici- 
pants were around our age. 

What are we supposed to do'? 

As we think back to the days 
when we had fun at the festival, 
images of clowns in the parade, fin- 
ger painting in the park, and watch- 
ing people show oft their pets come 
into mind. 

Things like going lo the zoo also 
were memories that wc all share 



To me editor, 

During President Clinton's first 
Presidential campaign, he scored 
public approval points by denounc- 
ing a Reagan/Bush administration 
Agency for International 
Development (AID) program 
which sunk over half a billion into 
promoting the flight of U.S. manu- 
facturing operations to Central 
American and Caribbean countries 
with low wages, no unions, and 
industrial tax-free zones. 

Congress subsequently passed 
legislation prohibiting AID from 
spending money on job exports, but 
a much nastier corporate welfare 
program for U.S. manufacturers 
relocating or already operating 
abroad remains in place, ignored by 
politicians and the corporate press 
alike: U.S. taxpayer- financed sup- 
port for the violent suppression of 




from being kids. 

Why would we want to do any 
of these things now'.' 

Actually, if many of us tried to 
do most of these things we would 
probably be kicked out of the area 
altogether or at least laughed at. 

There are a few concerts that are 
associated with the festival, but none 
of them really tune into our interests. 

WXKE. Rock 104FM, brought 
Quiet Rioi. Slaughter, and Firehouse 
to town, but not everyone wants to 
go see bands that were popular ten to 
fifteen years ago. 

These bands were at the height 
of their fame when some of us were 
just figuring out the difference 
between a noun and a verb. 

I guess there is a bit of nostalgia 



to it, but it's just of no interest to our 
age group. 

Another thing that was really 
cool when we were kids was the 
Midway. 

Wc couldn't wait until wewere 
big enough to go on all of the "big 
kids" rides, but by time we were big 
enough other factors bad come into 
the scene 

Now that we can ride all of the 
rides, most of us are honestly too 
scared of all of the pushers and 
wannabe -gang hangers that come out 
at night there every year. 

One additional gripe about the 
Midway: It is loo far away from the 
rest of the events. 

Can't it be a little bit closer to 
everything else? Just a thought. 



The image of the event por- 
trayed by the media is that it is a 
really big thing and that you should- 
n't miss it. 

However, there are a few big 
problems with the festival overall 
that have nothing to do with age. 

Our problem is that for all of the 
things that there are lo do downtown 
during the festival, ihey could prob- 
ably all be done within a matter of a 
few hours or less. 

Another problem is thai the 
advertising for the event makes it 
sound as if there is really more to it 
man there actually is. 

This feels like a major let-down 
when you go to the festival for the 
First time and find out di.it there isn't 
a heck of a lot to do. 



6y Otnny sHe - Editorial Cortooniit 

Whal could aclually be done lo 
make room for more events suitable 
for people our age? 

Tne "best tan contest" used to be 
pretty popular with the younger 
crowd. 

We know that event is now not 
possible because tanning and skin 
cancer are linked, but whal about 
some type of body building or beau- 
ty pageant that crowns a Mr. and 
Miss Fort Wayne? 

We're not sure what really could 
be done to make this festival better 
for next year for the undcr-thirty 
crowd, but maybe the planners 
should come up with a committee to 
solve this problem. 



Letter to trie Editor 



wages and decent living conditions 
in countries where U.S. manufac- 
turers relocate. 

Clinton enthusiastically sup- 
ports U.S. training of foreign mili- 
taries (hat brutally repress labor 
union organizers and others who 
support fair compensation and 
basic human rights for working 
people. For example, after 
Congress passed a measure pro- 
hibiting the U.S. (raining of 
Indonesian military through the 
International Military and Training 
Program (IMETP)-- in the wake of 
a brutal slaughter in (he Indonesia- 
occupied country of East Timor-- 
the Clinton administration side- 
stepped the law by continuing the 
training of Indonesian military 
through a different program, the 
Joint Combined Exchange Training 
Program (JCETP). The East Timor 
Action Network has reported that 



among those trained were 
Indonesian forces involved in the 
torture and murder of dissidents in 
both East Timor and Indonesia. 
Military training our government 
provides Indonesia props up a sys- 
tem that jails independent trade 
unionisLs and violently persecutes 
workers who call for living wages, 
the right to free association, democ- 
racy, and economic justice, so that 
Nike and other U.S. based compa- 
nies can exploit child labor and pay 
their workers next to nothing in 
unsafe and unhealthy sweatshops. 

While JCETP training of anti- 
union thugs helps maintain a wage 
slave system in Indonesia, the U.S. 
Army School of the Americas at 
Fort Benning. Georgia trains anti- 
tabor terrorists from countries in 
Latin America and the Caribbean. 

Congressman Mark Souder is 
among the ardent supporters of this 



terrorism training center. 

Latin American wages and the 
basic necessities of life have been 
minimized by the decrees of SOA- 
traincd dictaiors and Generals, and 
organizing efforts for better wages, 
working conditions, and democrat- 
ic reforms have been crushed by 
SOA-trained military officials and 
death squad leaders. 

In Guatemala and El Salvador, 
where many U.S. garment and 
other manufacturers relocated to 
so-called "free trade zones" with 
the assistance of AID'S job export 
program, trade unionists have been 
threatened, tortured and assassinat- 
ed by SOA graduates. Mexico, now 
one of the primary recipients of 
SOA military training, has seen a 
corresponding increase in violent 
repression and human rights abuses 
by its military; much of the perse- 
cution there is currently focused on 



Indians and peasants in the Slate of 
Chiapas, who revolted on the day 
the North American Free Trade 
Agreement was implemented 
Columbia, probably the largest cur- 
rent "beneficiary" of SOA training, 
also currently has the worst human 
rights record in Ihe Wesiern 
Hemisphere. 

We, as taxpayers and working 
people, should not have to subsi- 
dize terrorism against working peo- 
ple in other countries wiih our lax 
dollars. We shouldn't have to pay 
for violence that maintains artifi- 
cially cheap costs for manufactur- 
ers who leave our shores. By pay- 
ing lo cut ihe throats of others, we 
cut our own. 



Respect and Service 



All I want is a little respect 
from ihe service industry. 

For example, when you go out 
and fill up your car with gas, how 
many limes has Ihe attendant for- 
gotten lo thank you? 

He or she forgets lo thank you 
for pumping your own gas, all the 
while blowing smoke in your face 
from their little world in die little 
glass cubicle. 

How many limes have you 
walked out of a gas station after 
paying for your fuel and you smell 
like you have spent the night in a 
pool hall? 

How the limes have changed. 

I remember when the atten- 
dants used to pump your gas, and 
ihey asked if they could check your 
oil and clean your windshield. 



I think the "service" industry 
needs lo be renamed to the "We're 
just here to take your money, and 
don't let the door hit you on the 
way out, business." 

All I'm asking for is a bit of 
respect. 

Retail stores also seem lo lack 
appreciation for their customers. 

How many times have you 
gone to buy clothing and when you 
go to ask for assistance, (he sales- 
people run for the hills? 

They have a look of panic on 
iheir face as if they fear you have 
the plague. 

How hard is ii for salespeople 
lo ring you up? 

My favorite scene is when ihe 
cashier is chatting on the phone 
about his or her social life and you 



are trying to peek your head around 
the cash register to see your total. 

Is it too much to ask for us to 
hear, "Your total is S13.95. Have a 
nice day"? 

I don'l lake this type of behav- 
ior personalty, bul I tend not io fre- 
quent siores where I feel no appre- 
ciation. 

Is "ihank you" becoming 
extinct in the English language? 

Al the risk of sounding like 
Rodney Dangerficld, all I want is a 
litde respect. 

Some appreciation would be 
nice too. 

Restaurants too are not 
immune lo this type of behavior. 

Whenever 1 go out to a restau- 
rant with family and friends, all I 
want is good food delivered within 



a reasonable amount of time 

Do you ever feel as if your 
waiter or waitress has been sucked 
in the twilight zone after they have 
taken your order. 

After they have taken your 
order and mysteriously vanish, you 
are ready to start looking for their 
face on a milk carton because you 
haven't seen them for so long. 

Just a lillle appreciation is all 
I'm asking for. 

On the other hand, loo much 
"appreciation" can also be a prob- 
lem. 

If I have to hear another relent- 
lessly cheerful rendition of "Happy 
Birthday" sung to a customer by a 
group of waiters and waitresses 
clapping their hands out of lime, 
I'm going io speak to my congress- 



by Joe Strange 
Copy Editor 



man to enact a bill to have this type 
of torture oudawed. 

I think some of these establish- 
ments could put these employees to 
better use. 

Perhaps they could work on 
cleaning the resiroom. 

Restaurant owners, you don'l 
have to entertain your customers 
with a song dance. 

That's not what we're paying 
for. Just lei us eat good food in 
peace. 

To all of the service industry, 
all mat customers want is good ser- 
vice and respect. 

To top off good service, we 
would like to hear a sincere "thank

OPINIONS 




las it happened to you? 



T would like to share with you an expe- 
rience like none other lhat I have had Oris 
summer. 

On a whim I decided 10 lake a trip lo 
ihc windy cily of Chicago for a day. 

1 had been io Chicago probably ten to 
fifteen limes in my life Tor various reasons, 
but not once had T ever driven there let 
alone in the cily. 

To add to the excitement. I didn't real- 
ize that 1 had forgotten to grab my handy 
map that my insurance agency hands out 
every year until I was just reaching 
Valparaiso. 

I figured that I was well too far into my 
journey lo turn back, so 1 proceeded on. 

The drive was pleasant even though 1 
couldn't 'in.: one good radio station to tune 
into, but what can you really expect when 
you arc traveling through Northern Indiana. 

Eventually I decide 10 take the toll road 
into downtown Chicago. I had no idea 
which exit was the one I needed, so every 
few I would just turned off lo see what 
there was to see. 

Then 1 came upon a sign that said 
"Ijrice Shore Drive 1 mi. Ahead" I knew 
dial all of the museums were down there, so 
I figured why not. 

I look the exit, but to my surprise pan 
of Hi-, road was under construction, so I 
look ihe detour which was very interesting. 

The detour led me to a building which 
had a viaduci that looked very much like a 
parking garage entrance. 

] looked around to see if there was any 
other way to get out of going inlo this 
building, but there was no escape. 

I would have to say that this was the 
beginning lo all of the weirdness that I 
would experience in Ihe next few hours. 

After driving through the building, I 
just wanted lo find a highway and gel 
downtown. I knew that there were some 
really cool stores on Michigan Avenue, so 
that's where 1 wanted to go. 

I found a highway (don't have any idea 
which one it was) and got off at an exit 
- about five blocks from tie John Hancock 
Building. 

I headed in the direction of the John 
Hancock Building and started to look for a 



place to park. 

Then I saw another sign which read 
"Public Parking". The sign was next to a 
spiral drive thai led up to the John Hancock 
Building. I decided "What the heck?" and 
drove up the spiral drive. 

After about two and a half minutes of 
turning the car in the same direction I came 
upon another sign thai said mat parking was 
S6.25 for a half hour or less and S9.75 for a 
half hour to an hour and a half. 

There was no way in hell that I was 
going to pay dial much io park. 

I found the quickest way to ihe cxil and 
explained to the attendant thai I had no idea 
thai it cosi so much to park here and ihey let 
me go without paying for the drive through. 

So I wound my way down another spi- 
ral drive and reached the bottom quile 
dizzy. 

I then roamed around until 1 found a 
nice little parking garage and decided that I 
could afford $12 for the day lo park. 

After about an hour of driving through 
the cily I was finally a pedestrian. First des- 
tination: Michigan Avenue. 

I hit a couple of interesting stores; 
Viacom, Borders, a couple of an stores and 
such. 

The stores were boring compared lo ihe 
culture lhat existed outside their doors. 

One thing I hardly ever saw were police 
officers. There were security offers roam- 
ing around the streets, but the city police 
were hardly ever seen. 

I did sec a few squad cars around every 
once in a while and ihey were all banged 
up. 

Some of the craziest things around 
were the sireel people and the beggars. 

The first one I saw was a little old man 
holding out a coffee cup that be obviously 
got from "The Chicago Tribune" store. I 
gave him a dollar and went on my way. 

Some of the more interesting people 
lhat were deserving of some change were 
the people who were ai least trying io do 
something for ihe money. 

There was a mime out in front of 
Tiffany's that was excellent. He slood in 
one pose for the whole time lhat I was in 
FAi &gt; .Schwartz. 



There were also some musicians. One 
man played on a congo drum and it got very 
annoying after a few minutes due to the 
echo of it against the buildings. 

There was a guy near the river thai had 
all kinds of electronic gear and just played 
a a pan flute to some new age beat mix. It 
wasraiher unique. 

There was another guy who looked like 
he was almost famished that played some 
old blues licks on a guitar. 

If I had any change left in my pocket I 
would have given it to this guy. 

Most of the beggars really annoyed me. 
There was a lady silling on a bridge who 
had lo weigh about three hundred pounds 
and kept saying to people, "Hi. Have any 
money for food?" 

I figured lhat she looked like she ale 
enough. 

One of the people that I mosl vividly 
remember is this old guy who was holding 
a large picket sign with wriling on it aboul 
die 50s and 60s and how the government 
was and is so corrupt. 

He was wearing a white pin-striped suit 
and hat, and shouted his message through a 
bullhorn. 

It was quite amusing to listen io this 
man ramble on about things that no one 
there cared aboul. 

It would probably be equivalent to 
going to a hockey game and trying io lalk to 
some stranger about crocheting a blanket or 
something. 

1 continued on my walk down 
Michigan Avenue. 1 looked into a window 
display of the Cole Haan shoe store, and 
almost goi run down by an old lady in a 
motorized wheel chair. This wasn't your 
average motorized wheel chair, you sec. 

I waiched the lady escape into the 
crowd of shoppers like a ghost because ihe 
wheel chair was traveling at an enormous 
rate of speed. It should have required a 
license plate. 

I decided lhat ii probably wasn't in my 
interest to go any farther down the street so 
I crossed at the next intersection and head- 
ed south. 

On the other side of Ihe street there was 
a man wearing a sandwich board which 



read on one side "You can buy flags every 
day of the year" and on Ihc other side read 
"Christmas is discouraged in Russian style 
communism." 

Then 1 saw that he loo had a bull horn 
so I passed him as soon as I could. 

I saw a flier on ihe ground and looked 
ai it and it was a promotion for the "Taste of 
Chicago" where all of ihe city's vendors get 
together and have a little festival that 
blocks off a few streets. I figured that I 
might as well. 

The festival was located right behind 
the Museum of ihc Chicago Institute of Art. 

On the way 1 saw the most interesting 
hum (er. homeless person). 

Imagine, if you will, a guy about 25 
years old wearing filthy grunge-style cloth- 
ing with about a three-week growth of hair 
on his face, almost passed out on some- 
thing, slumped over silling against a stone 
wall. 

The funny part of this was the sign he 
had hung around his neck which read, 
"Need mony for beer." 

I know lhat the person was probably 
illiterate or menially divergent, bul I apprc- 
ciaied ihe honesty. 

I continued on wiih my journey to 
Destination Two: "Taste of Chicago." 

1 reached the lop of a bridge lhat was 
very close io the festival and gazed at what 
I was about to attempt. I looked out and as 
far as I could see there were people jammed 
into every little available crevice. 

I thought for aboui 1/3 of a second and 
decided (hat 1 had enough of an adventure 
for the day. and headed back io the car to 
head home. 

I got to the car and headed for the 
Skyway. I was headed down Lake Shore 
Drive (LSD) when the worst thing possible 
" look a WTong turn. 

I wandered around for a liltle bit trying 
to look for more signs io get io the Skyway, 
but my luck was running out. I was in 
South Chicago, lost, and all by myself. 

Afler a little bit I decided to just head 
west and hope to come to some sort of 
south-bound freeway. 

I passed 14 liquor siores thai had steel 
gates closed in front of them.

Managing Editor 



I decided to jusi keep on going. 

Finally, after aboul 45 minutes of ari- 
sing around I saw a sign thai pointed to ihe 
highway. Luckily I had passed all of the loll 
booths, due lo the fact that I was almost 
penniless. 

From then on everything went smooth- 
ly, as 1 drove straight back highway 30 io 
good ole' Fort Wayne.

Norton, J 

I jusi can't seem to please any- 
one lately. I've been contemplating 
and only contemplating, mind you, 
The Great Question: When should I 
have a baby? I've been thinking 
aboui having a baby for ai least a 
year or so. for a wide variety or 
reasons. 

1. Many of my friends have children. 
As I watch those children grow up, 1 
feel (his ache inside, because I wish 
lhat I had a child of my own. I cannot 
go through the baby section of a store 
without gelling misty-eyed. Don'i 
even gel me sinned about how tortur- 
ous it is shopping for baby shower 
presents... 

2. 1 seem to "aliract" children when 
surrounded by them. They just grav- 
itaie to me for some reason. Maybe 
it's because I like to color with 
crayons and play with toys... I'm not 
really sure, but it happens every 

- lime. 

* 3. 1 get teased about it by my family. 
X- My Mom and one of my aunts had a 
".- "friendly wager" aboul which one of 
''. them would be a Grandma first 1 got 
~ married almost a year before my 
;; cousin, so the expected winner was 
■ my aunt Well, my cousin's daughter 
was bom last December, and I'm still 
without child. 

4. My younger brother even goi in on 
the act He got married almost a year 
' ago, and he and his wife are expect- 
ing their first child in a few weeks 
They are both younger than I am. 1 
feel old and. somehow, like I'm noi a 
very good wife. 

I'm slightly jealous, I guess, 
because 1 have wanted to have a 
child for some lime, bul had to wait 
until I finished college. 

Well, after what will be six years, 
graduation has a place in my plans 
for next May. 

However, I've decided that I 
warn io go to graduate school imme- 
diately after I graduate, if for no 
other reason than to avoid taking a 
break and being forced lo begin my 



student loan payments. 

I bad a plan thai would "fix" all 
of Ihcse problems, bul it seems lo 
have developed a glitch. 

My plan was, until recently, this: 
1 would have a baby early next sum- 
mer, go to graduate school as 
planned in ihe fall, but only go pan- 
time. Then I could 1 have plenty of 
time at home with my new liltle 
baby. However. I'm terrified that I'll 
continue on my "career student" path 
if I go io school part-time again. 

I have fair reason to be terrified 
of this, too: I'm gelling ready io start 
my sixth (and final) year of under- 
graduate life. I hated college for the 
first few years, so I took my time at 
it; now that 1 love it, I don't really 
wani to stop while I'm on a roll. 

I've finally found something 
thai I love for a career, and t don't 
want lo lake lime off before I've 
even goiten a chance to spread my 
wings in the world. But I really want 
a baby — is thai so wrong? 

I also need a job while I'm in 
Graduate School lo take some of the 
bill-paying pressure off of my 
husband. 

Now, I know thai you all think 
that I must make scads of money as 
the Head Honcho of The 
Communicator, but alas, mat is very, 
very untrue. The things we do for 
love... of wriling. 

So, what's a feminist career- 
minded gal to do? Give up my Ph. 
D. -driven dreams lo join the baby 
buggy-pushers? Get those Masters 
and Doctoral degrees, but not have a 
child until I'm 35? 

If I wait that long, will I want to 
stop dead in my career-building 
tracks and bring a child into this 
world, then ignore it and leave it with 
the sitter all day while I work? How 
fair is that to me or the baby? 

I also have to think about what's 
fair io my husband. He's ihree years 
older than I am, and the longer I wail, 
the older we both get. 

We both have extremely young 
parents, and liked die way mat we 
could always relate to them, and 
them to us We have always said thai 
we would like the same relationship 
wiih our children "someday." 
Someday is suddenly today, and now 
we're both very, very scared. 

My husband is about lo Stan 
graduate school too, and there's no 
possible way thai we can handle two 
jobs, two graduate siudeni educa- 
tions, a baby and still be sane after- 



wards. If we tried to juggle all of 
those balls ai once, one or iwo of 
them will definitely fall to the 
ground, and 1 am afraid lo think of 
which one il will be. 

How fair is any of this? How fair 
is il that I can't have all of these 
things? I'm sure lhat ihere are ways 
to do everything, but something will 
inevitably suffer. 

1 could make sacrifices, but I 
can't find anything that will be worth 
sacrificing that will actually improve 
die situation, anyway. 

Going to graduate school part- 
lime isn't an effective solution for 
me. simply because I have already 
been in school for an awfully long 
time, and I'm already behind others 
my age by almost two years. 

If 1 take my lime going through 
graduate school too, I am afraid I'll 
never get inio the world again lo 
make much use of all of this educa- 
tion I'm getting. 

Why are modem women forced 
inio such a comer? I get looks of pity 
from friends who have been married 
for only a short time but already have 
a child or two. 

They know how very much I 
want my own Hide one lo hold, but 
that option is off-limits for now. 

Others think I'm "wailing" 
because 1 musi not really want chil- 
dren at all; I'm one of those "femi- 
nists" who must not want kids 

When I tell them that I really do 
want children, they think that I'm in 
"loo much of a hurry." You 're young: 
you have plenty of lime to have chil- 
dren, ihey say. Don't let wanting a 
child get in the way of your dreams. 

Funny, bul 1 just don't see a child 
as a stumbling block. It's just some- 
thing thai I warn. But I also want my 
career. 

And I don'l know how I'm sup- 
posed to have both, and it makes me 
very sad io not have an answer to thai 
"When are you gonna have a baby?" 
question. 

If I had my way, I'd have one as 
soon as I could, because I really want 
to. 

I really do feel thai so-called 
"Biological Clock" licking some- 
where within, and I really want lo 
answer its call. Bul I can't noi right 
now. 

Guess those baby names lhat my 
husband and I picked out in a fu of 
wishful thinking won't be pul to use 
for a iitde bit longer. I'll sldl be 
thinking aboui them, though.

Local bands get chance to show off 



Apple pies and American flags. 
Those were the words "Extreme" 96.3 
DJ Michael Dean used to describe his 
station's latest concert. 

The "Extreme Essentials Live in 
the Park" concert was held on 
Saturday. July 11, at Swinney Park 
from 1 to 5:30 p.m.. 

The purpose of the concert was to 
promole The Extreme's new CD that 
they put together from submissions 
over the pasl year taken from local 
alternative bands in the Fort Wayne 
area. 

All around, it was a huge success. 

Five bands played at the concert, 
which started just a little after 1 p.m. 

Present were Soul Mine, Hobo 
Joe, Sunny Taylor Band, Blue Moon 
Boys, and Skavossas. 

Skavossas gained fame from last 
year's "Edge Essentials" CD, in addi- 
tion to playing local coffee houses 
such as The LofL 

Passes were given out that includ- 
ed free games at Ultra Zone and free 
movies, as well as various "Extreme" 
paraphernalia such as shirts and slick- 
ers. 

There was free food and free 
entertainment for all that showed up. 

The concert proved to be quite 
entertaining for everyone. 

The bands seemed to be having a 
really good lime and played their best. 

The crowd seemed to be enjoying 
themselves, dancing off and on 
between sun bathings in the 85-degree 
beat. 

Parents took a break from pushing 
their kids on the swings and came over 
to listen at no cost, as all of it was free. 

Teenagers came with their friends 
and got to hang out all afternoon, 
enjoying the beautiful day. 

Even though it was estimated there 
were between 600 to 1,000 people at 
the concert, there was an unusual lack 
of violence. 

The only son of violence that 
erupted was when a bottle was thrown 
at the stage and hit a woman. 

This action was immediately repri- 
manded by the lead singer of 
Skavossas. 

With the exception of that one iso- 
lated incident, everyone seemed to get 
along pretty well. 

The major event, though, came in 
between sets with the announcement 
of the bands that would be included on 
the second volume of "Extreme 
Essentials." 

Although there were plenty of new 
bands that made it, it's all expected to 
be good music. 

Bands included on the CD are: 

1. Skavossas 

2. soulmine 

3. Hobo Joe 

4. Sunny Taylor Band 

5. The Beauties 

6. Sometime Tuesday 



7. Blythe Leisure 

8. James Bond Goes 

Surfing 

9. Cavefish 

10. DlCTATORTOTS 

11. Blue Moon Boys 

12. Black Tooth Grin 

These are the 12 hands that have 
come together for the new "Extreme 
Essentials, Volume Two'" CD. 

They all can be heard locally in 
various coffee shops and bars in the 
Fort Wayne area, and some even have 
their own following within the region. 

According to the DJs at "The 
Extreme," there is a growing demand 
for some of the bands, even though 
they are barely known on the radio 
(with exception to a "Locals" show 
done by Michael Dean). 

Skavossas. one of the big head lin- 
ers from the first "Essentials" CD, 
even made it to number one repeated- 
ly on the "Top Six at Six" last Spring 
as a result of their growing fans. 

They still get quite a few calls dur- 
ing the week to play Skavossas. 

If you missed the concert, though, 
"The Extreme" 



their music. 

Beyond the CD, though, 
"Extreme" DJ Michael Dean hosts a 
local music show on 96.3 every 
Sunday at 8:30 pjn. where he random- 
ly plays music from whatever local 
bands he can get bold of. 

Lately he has been playing 
"Extreme Essential" music submis- 
sions that may or may not have made 
it to the CD. 

If you are interested in hearing 
what the people in your area have been 
pulling out music-wise, you may want 
to tune in this weekend. 

Otherwise, it is highly advised 
that you tune in to the "Extreme" for 
future concert information. 

They've put on some wild con- 
certs in the past, this one being no 
exception, and fully intend to do the 
same in the future. 

After all, what better way could 
one spend a summer day than a 
Saturday in the park?

Musical presented by 
department of theatre 



ricAxon 



BY ADAM TAYLOR 
STAFF WRITER 



The IPFW department of the- 
atre is proud to present ils fifth 
annual American Classics Theatre 
Series. 

"How to Succeed in Business 
Without Really Trying," directed 
and choreographed by Larry L. 
Life, opened in the IPFW Williams 
Theatre on July 10. 

Performances will follow July 
16-18 and 22-25 at 8 p.m. and July 
19 and 26 at 2:30 p.m. 

The musical is a simple story of 
a young man who climbs to a posi- 
tion of great power and the girl who 
loyally hangs on during his climb, 
eventually winning him. 

In this wonderful musical satire 
on the "Organi;tation Man," success 
is due neither to hard work nor any 
ancient prescriptions for success. 

Rather, he gets ahead by follow- 
ing the simple rules in a book called 
"How to Succeed in Business 
Without Really Trying." 

The hero, J. Pierrepont Finch. 
runs into many obstacles and over- 
comes them like a modem, comic 
Seinfeld. 

Other characters include the 
boss's nephew, the mailroom tramp, 
the office wolf, the executives and, 
of course, the big boss himself. 

From the first coffee break to 
the last elevator load on Friday 
night, office life is never the same 
once "Ponty" Finch settles in for the 
trip to the top. 

The department of theatre is 



pleased to welcome community 
guest anisl Larry Wardlaw as J. B. 
Bigley and faculty anisl Craig A. 
Humphrey as Bud Frump. 

Other actors and the roles they 
play include: Brian Poncr as J. 
Pierrepont Finch, Jocelyn Romanak 
as Rosemary Pilkington, Anna 
Mossburg as Hcdy La Rue, Brcnda 
Poncr as Miss Jones, and Jane 
FrazierasSmitty. 

"How to Succeed in Business 
Without Really Trying" is a Three 
Rivers Festival eveni.

Esteemed psychologist 
presents art shov 



BY ADAM TAYLOR 
STAFF WRITER 



"Dean Franiz on the An of Peter 
Birkhauser: A Modem Anist Whose 
Paintings Are Medicine For the 
Soul" will be presented Tuesday, 
July 21. at 7:30 p.m. at Unity Christ 
Church in Fort Wayne. 

Dean Frantz earned his diploma 
in analytical psychology from the 
C.G. Jung Institute in Zuricb, 
Switzerland. 

It was during this time in 
Switzerland that he met Birkhauser. 



Frantz did his thesis work at the 
Jung Institute on the work of 
Birkhauser, then spent an additional 
two years with die artist. 

Frantz tells us that "when arche- 
typal images find expression 
through art, they can assist us in 
finding the deeper meaning of life, 
and lead us to experience the 
beyond. C.G. Jung often spoke of 
the importance of creating our own 
myth about death during our life- 
lime." 

Birkhauser was a Swiss artist 
who knew Jung and whose illustra- 
tions are found in Jung's books. 

His paintings were not only an 
expression of his own inner world 



but ihey also provide a vehicle for 
viewers to see into their own depths 
and experience that which is beyond 
lime and space. 

In his lecture and slide presenta- 
tion, Frantz will focus on the 
beyond, the archetypal basis of 
Birkhauser's paintings. 

The beauty of this an in repro- 
ductions will invite viewers to expe- 
rience the beyond. 

A large gathering is anticipated, 
so il would be best to arrive early. 

Donations will be accepted at 
the church.

Monotony once visited, 
and visited again 



BY ADAM TAYLOR 
STAFF WRITER 



Lying in bed after being so rude- 
ly woken by the sound of chirping 
birds, Henry couldn't help but think 
of how bad his life was. 

Angry his girlfriend broke up 
with him, angry he had a paper due 
nexl week, and angry for having no 
life and no future ahead of him. he 
finally convinced himself that he 
was going lo have a bad day no 
mailer what be did. 

The least he could do is go buy 
a pack of cigareiies and gel rid of 
his headache. 

He got up out of bed and walked 
over to his CD player, putting in the 
CD he bought wilh his last pay- 
check a month ago before he got 
fired. 

"Great," he thought to himself. 
"Now I can be pissed about some- 
thing else." 

Not really caring what he 
looked like, he threw on some 
shoes and weni out to his car so he 
could go buy some coffee and 
cigareiies. 

Looking at his car. he saw per- 
haps the besi motivation lo finish 
college one could ever have. 

Sure, his car was top of ihe line 
at a point in the history of 
automobiles. 

Problem was, it was before he 
was bom. 

He climbed in amidst the shriek 
of a squeaky door and headed lo ihe 
gas station lo fill up. 

Driving out lo the gas station he 
couldn't help but notice something. 

Everything seemed like it was 
dead to him. 

The trees looked just as he had 
imagined ihem to. 



He knew the bumps of the road 
like they were scars from a brutal 
fight. 

The buildings were like pic- 
tures from a history book he'd read 
one too many limes, li was like he 
was in a dream, only he knew too 
well he was awake. 

He'd seen this scene loo many 
times to know it was all reality. 

"Twenty-two years," he though), 
"and this is all the better I can do. 
My best friend's married in a dif- 
ferent state and I'm siiil driving 
down ihe same road I was when I 
learned how to drive. This is nice, 
I really like ihis." 

With a deep sigh, he pulled into 
ihe gas station and pumped S5 
worth of gas before going in. 

As he handed the lady behind 
the counter ihe exact change he 
needed, she got out ihe pack of cig- 
arettes she knew to be his favorite 
as he weni over to pour some 
coffee. 

Same routine, nothing differ- 
ent. Anything else is unnecessary. 

With half a smile, he thanked 
the lady he saw more than most of 
his friends and headed back out lo 
his car wilh too much time lo kill 
and no options whatsoever present- 
ing themselves. 

The resi of his day went by even 
slower than his morning had. 

Same talk shows, same stupid 
soap operas all over the place. 

After lunch he got ihe nerve to 
flip the remote to the Premium 
channels his parents were paying 
S10 a month for, only to be more 
disappointed. 

As exciting as the possibility of 
a decent movie being on was, he 
was lei down lo discover ihe only 
thing on the "bonus" channels were 
some old black and white movies 
his grandmother used to make him 
watch when he was a kid as punish- 
ment for tracking din in ihe house 



on his visits. 

"This has lo be some son of a 
joke," he said lo no one. 

Finally fed up wilh channel surf- 
ing, he threw on some shorts and a 
hat and headed oul lo the park. 

There he was met with ihe '. 
option of a pick-up game, and since 
he loved basketball he jumped right 
on il. 

The venture seemed perfect 
and nearly would' ve been if il was- 
n't for the fight he got into with one - 
of his own teammates about not 
passing enough and missing his 
man, who was the lop scorer for the 
other team. 

Too angry to play anymore, he 
didn'i even bother finding a 
replacement before driving off. 

His drive home was uneventful, 
besides ihe radio playing nothing 
bui what he would term as "crap." 

He finally gave up on being 
happy and decided lo buy a case of- 
beer and drink the rest of ihe day 
away. 

He grabbed a lawn chair and a. 
radio and proceeded to the back- 
yard around sundown to forget.' 
about how stupid and insignificant 
his life was. 

Many hours later, he found him- 
self lying in a lipped-over lawn- 
chair on freshly mowed, dew cov--; 
cred grass. 

Looking around him, he 
noticed something very different. 

It was no longer dark anymore, 
yet the light hadn't quite made il 
oui either. 

The birds were chirping softly 
as he stood up and gazed upon ihe 
Earth before il came to life. 

He had never been awake at" 
this lime of ihe day before and he 
had never been so awake in bis life. 

"Funny," he thought to himself. 
"Looks like it's going to be a beau- 
tiful day."
