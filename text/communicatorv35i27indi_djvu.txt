GOOD LUCK! 



ing from the doctoral program 
at the University of Denver, 
in addition to teaching a few 
classes, she entered the work 
force as a psychologist at a Col- 
orado hospital. But she always 
enjoyed her job teaching. 

"I got asked back to occa- 
sionally to teach a class, and it 
caught up with me," she said. 
"I just really enjoyed it. Plus, it 
is a better opportunity for re- 
search than being a full time 



_ht for 16 
years before coming to IPFW. 
Leaving an ailing University of 
Colorado system, She set her 
sights on Fort Wayne. Arriving 
in 2001, she has joined a grow- 
ing psychology depart! 



DiClimenti has contrib- 
uted to the campus in many 
ways since her arrival. Last year 
saw the first ever Diversity and 
Cross-Cultural Festival, which 
began as an idea for a cross- 
cultural psychology class proj- 

"As a class project, they 
really rose to the occasion," she 
said of her Cross-Cultural Psy- 
chology class. "What I thought 

would be something small like

nizations, but community or- 
ganizations as well. I think they 
are expecting us to do it again, 
this year, and I think we will. We 
had a lot of fun it last year." 

She also said the festival's 
overall goal was two-fold, not 
just as an educational tool for 
the students of her class, but 
for the campus as a whole. 

DiClimenti teaches other 
interesting classes on campus. 
She is offering a new course for 
summer, a course in the psy- 
chology of HIV. As a product of 
her long history working with 
HIV and AIDS, dating as far 
back as 19)37, and with experi- 
ence as a trainer for the Amer- 
ica Psychological Association's 
Office fur Psychological educa- 
tion, DiClimenti thought a class 
offering education and aware- 
ness about the disease would 
benefit the students' on cam- 
pus, training social workers 
and mental health profession- 
als about the disease led her to 
development of the course. 

"The best defense against 
HIV and AIDS is not abstinence; 
it is education," she said. "With 
the age group of 15 to 24 being 
at the highest risk for contract- 
ing the disease, education is 
very important to preventing 
the contractions and spreading 
of the disease," 

DiClimenti would like to 
offer the course again in the

Her research area is in clinical 
health psychology. Of the many 
endeavors she is working on, 
from looking at hypnotization 
as a tool to the exploration of 
why people develop a phobia of 
visiting the dentist, She points 
out the applicability of her re- 
search to the world at large. 

"My research is very ap- 
plied. It tends to be research 
you can actually use," she said. 
Turning toward her work with 
dental anxiety, DiClimenti said 
she is looking at that area be- 
cause of some alarming sta- 
tistics she found. About 75 
percent of people are afraid of 
going to the dentist, probably 
something to do with the fact 
that preventative dental care is 
more painful than most other 
procedures. 

Because of the almost 
natural aversion to the dentist's 
chair, DiClimenti is research- 
ing what predictors can lead 
to the development of a dental 
phobia, as well as which vari- 
able will get people anxious. In 
addition, she is looking at what 
things can be done to help peo- 
ple get over their fears. 

As for. when she escapes 
the confines of campus, she is 
somewhat of an adventurer. She 
enjoys the outdoors, regard- 
less of the temperature. She has

Indiana U. student groups square 
off in foreign policy debate 



both sides stuck to their party 
lines and at times the debate 
intensified, especially 



and College Hepubli 
square off Wednesday night in a 
U.S. foreign policy debate in the 
Frangipani Room in the Indiana 
Memorial Union. 

The two parlies debated 
five key issues: United States' 
policies toward Iraq, Iran, Ko- 
rea, the United Nations and 
foreign trade agreements. The 
College Republicans were rep- 
resented by Brian Stewart and 
David White, and the College 
Democrats were represented by 
lustin Fallick and Mike Doyle. 
The debate was moderated by 
professor Jeffrey Hart of the po- 



rizing their parties views on 
foreign policy. The Democrats 
cited the Republicans' foreign 
policies as "gung-ho, Yosemite 
Sam policies," and that, "they 
do not work." Their three over- 
arching goals pertaining to for- 
eign policy are to fight a global 
war on terror, to stop the spread 
of nuclear and biological weap- 
ons, and to spread democracy 
throughout the world. 

The Republicans then 
gave their opening statement, 
which claimed their foreign 
policies are "well-founded in 
American tradition," and that 
their party "stands to fight the 
war on terror. Since 9- 1 1. we've 
hunted down 78 percent of al- 



Siewan said invading Iraq "was 
justified, as Saddam Husseinde- 
fied United Nations resolutions 
for 12 years." Doyle agreed with 
the notion that invading Iraq 
is justified, but then said tl 



"the fact i 

Bush lied about the reasons for 

going to war with Iraq. First, it

"It is imperative for Iran 
not to have nuclear weapons," a 
member of the College Demo- 
crats said. "They are a radical 
regime which has financially 
supported terrorist groups such 



they felt the Democrats' ap- 
proach to Iran leaned too much 
toward "appeasing" them, and 
that "this is the same political 
organization that said that we 
were too strong in invading Iraq 
to disarm them." 

After the debate portion of 
the night had finished, the audi- 
ence was given the opportunity 
to ask the panel members some 
questions. A question was posed 
to both panics regarding a state- 
ment by President Bush about

CLASSIC COMMUNICATOR — BOB LANG, 1984 



Filibusters keep majority 
party in check 



In the senate recently, there 
have been heated debates over 
curbing the filibuster democrats 
may enact on President Bush's 
judges appointed to the bench. 

A filibuster is, as the LA Times 
puts it, basically a minority keep- 
ing an issue in debates long enough 
to make the majority surrender to 
their wishes. 

Its use has been debated about 
by the senate for years. The issue 
is: is it a way for the minority party 
to keep checks and balances on the 
majority, or is it just an obstruc- 
tion to the democratic law-making 
system? 

Democrat Senate minority 
leader Harry Reid of New Mexico 
said that the Democrats would not 
shut down the senate. "They (Re- 
publicans) will. We have told them 
that we want to work with them," he 



said to "Face the Nation" on CBS. 

We agree with him. Filibus- 
ters keep the democratic system 
in check. A senate majority in the 
same party as the President, be it 
Democrat or Republican, needs 
to be kept from monopolizing the 
government. * 

Imagine a government that 
can muster a majority vote in each 
branch of Congress and the White 
House. There would be nothing to 
stop an overhaul of the nation's laws 
and even (though this is an extreme 
example) decide upon a new "inter- 
pretation" of the Constitution. 

Any party who gives themselves 
increasing power has the potential 
to become the Microsoft of Wash- 
ington, until they reach an event 
horizon of unipartisanship. And 
then the entire concept of democ- 
racy has been undermined.

New American past-time: 
judge bashing 



Staff Column 



When did \merican judges get so out of 
control? With all the carping about "activist 
judges" that is heard from talk radio hosts to 
people within the White House, it would seem 
that those judges with their "liberal" agendas 
have infiltrated and compromised this nations 
once fair, unbiased judiciary. 



between the 
violence and the politically motivat- 
ed decisions of Supreme i ouri iiidgcs. It's as if 
accused criminals' most pressing concern is the 
ludicioiisness of the Supreme I ourt I grcgions 
assumptions/allegations of this caliber could 
maybe be overlooked in a freshman essay, but a 
Senator? 

Conclusions like these are easily made In 
many conservatives lately, especially when they 
are trying to make strides in the court system. 
Sen. Tom DeLay (B-Texasi. obviously looking 
for cover, from his own unfair and illegal activi- 
ties, even pulled the Hitler card. DeLay. who, 
it should be noted, approved of removing one 
of his own relatives from life support, made a 
moral equivalency between the Supreme Court 
ruling on Terry Shiavo and Nazi death doctors 
in WWII. 

Not only is this another poor analogy, hut 
persons like DeLay are not just questioning the 
authority of ihe Supreme ( .ourt to make the rul- 
ings on, say, right-to-life issues, but are rather 
more threatening court justices. Cornyn said. 
"The time will come for the men responsible 
to answer for their behavior." In Delay's case, 
some legal analyst have even raised the issue of 
whether Del ay and other's comment constitute 
as illegal threats to federal judges. It would be a 
humorous irony if DeLay openly broke the layv in 
order to evade it. 

On the topic of Shiavo, if any one group has 



emerged as activist, it's undoubtedly the politi- 
cians who undertook the task of discrediting or 
circumventing the Supreme Court's authority. 
Similarly, the very group's casting of accusations 
is far more out of control and politically motivat- 
ed than any act by federal judges. Furthermore, 
how can a court that is generally split 5-4 really 
be considered anything but indecisive? 

What is going on here is clear: For groups 
at the extreme ends of national politics, judges 
have become the vogue means of policy change, 
not politicians. Ihe same political anger that 
enlivened red-state conservatives in the 2004 
election has been carried on in Bush's second 
term. Majority in all branches of government 
is not enough. Does the far right truly believe it 
is a wise move to discredit the nation's judicial 
branch on the whole? 

In related events last week, Republicans 
considered rewriting the rules on filibusters, so 
that a filibuster can be challenged if the majority 
of the House feels the filibuster is unfounded. 
It's true, of course, history being considered, that 
republicans have never used arbitrary or partisan 
filibusters for political ends.. .not. History, always 
a pest, also reminds us that many of the so-called 
"actiyist" judges ruling today were appointed by 
conservative people for conservative means — 
the far right, though, believes these judges have 
been corrupted by the judicial system. 

It's both funny and scary that the majority, 

is taking steps to challenge the authority of the 
nation's judii ial branch and change the checks 
and balances system, but this is precisely what's 
happening I he moral certainty and earnestness 
ot many involved is not in question here, yet if 
the opinion of politicians like Sen. Orrin Hatch 
(H-Utah), who said "the game is over forjudges," 
prevails, this country's judicial process will surely 
be compromised.

Serdar Sikca: love and volleyball 



For many athletes, there comes a time in their careers when they have to 
ask themselves. How ninth do I love this sport;' I hat question can come up after a 
serious injury, where months of rehabilitation await. Or, it can come up when you 
are forced to choose between slaying home and 1101 plav ing vour spoil or (raveling 
ouiside your comfort /.one to somepkn e where a better chance awaits. For junior 
Serdar Sikca, middle hitter for the IPFW mens volleyball team, that question came 
10 the Forefront in 2003. 

In Turkey, where Sikca is from, you cannot go to college and play athletics, 
it's either one 01 ihe oilier Sikca had a choice, he could either go lo college in his 
home country and not pla\ volleyball, or he could skip college and play professio- 
nally Sikta did some thinking, and those a third idea, lie would nave) across ihe 
world to Indiana, lo a campus he had never set foot on, 10 continue his academic 
and athletic careers. 

"I had seem some tape of IPFW and read a lot of siuff online, but the first 
time I came here was when I moved here,' sikca said. "I just wanted to come to 
the States because I wanted to come play my sport and go to college at the same 

Many athletes, including IPFW women's volleyball players Fabiana Souza 
and ( vnara Martens, made the same decision as Sikca lo tome to ihe United Slates 
lor tollege. Mens volleyball head touch Arme Ball has seen il happen many times in 
his 24 years on the volleyball sidelines. 

"We have had players from l ypnis. (.recce and other European counties 
■r and play lor us." Ball said, "Serdar (Sikca) seemed 10 adjust well right off 



other side or go across one of the two bridges thai links the two," Sikca said. "It 
usually took me an hour to get form my house to my school." 

Sikca is also a Muslim, who torn prise most ot ihe population of Turkey. But 
Sikca attended Si i a-orge's, a private high -i liool ih.ii homglii logelhei main diver- 
se groups which helped him adjust to others. Sikca was able to belter understand 
other ways ol life hv having a lew ami a Christian anion].; his t lose circle of friends 
at the high school. 

In high school. Sikca was forced to learn German, due to the fact that all 
of his classes were t.iughi m the language. I le also look ) ngli-.li classes, which hel- 
ped him prepare for the SAT's once he had decided to attend college in the Uniled 
States. 

"We all had to learn German in high school, but I also wanted to get used 
to using Fnglish," Sikca said. "I learned a loi getting reach For the SAT's." 

Sikca was not only preparing lor the tests he needed to take, but also was 
searching on the Internet for potential colleges he wanted to attend. When he 
slum bled upon IPFW. he im medial el v began resea idling the university and began 
sending tapes ot his volleyball skill- 10 ( ( &gt;jch Ball, including tape of him playing for 
the lurkish Junior National Team. 

"We didn't even rec 
some tapes, we liked what v 
efforl into getting our attention." 

After scoring a 1270 on his SATs, Sikca left the Turkish Junior National 
leam, which he had played fur lor three years and had been honored with various 
accolades, and bis family, ro head to Fori Wayne, sikta brought with him the honor

By Anthony Maurer 



The softball team dropped both 
of double headers last weekend. None of the 
games saw any great offensive output from the 
Mastodons, onl;

weekend games. 

Last Saturday, the Mastodons took on the 
lUPIJI Jaguars in their First of two double-head- 
ers. Pitching from junior Devan Craig held I PI W 
to no runs on one hit in the game. The jaguars, 
however, scored five runs on 1 1 hits. 

The lone hit lor the Mastodons came from 
designated hitter lenna Beachy, who singled 
to centerfield with one out in the 7th inning. 
Beachy was lelt on base as the last two outs were

not allowing any runs with a two hil performance 
over two innings. Elliot fanned two of the eight

slapped nine hits in 28 at-bats. The jaguars col- 
lected 11 hits, let I by three bit pel lorn lai ice from 
centerfielder Sarah Needy, to edge IPFW by one 
run. Needy was responsible for all the IUPUI 
runs, scoring one and hat i ing in the other two. 

IPFW trailed ,i-ll until the last inning, when 
third baseman Kacie Sione started off (be rally 
with a single Lelifielder Nicole Richardson got 
on after four hall-, bringing up pinch hitter Faura 
Randolph. Randolph popped a double to the gap 
in right center to drive in Stone. 

Then, catcher Ashley lohnson stepped 10 
die plate and hit another shot to righl center 
(hat sent both Richardson and Randolph Hying 
around the bases on their way home. 

Richardson scored easily, but a laser thrown 
from Sarah Needy in center cut down Randolph, 
lohnson was standing at third, when Heather 
DeVore grounded out to end the game. 

Sophomore Angelica Espinosa got the win 
for the Jaguars, giving up nine hits with three 
strikeouts ,md two walks. Ihe win improves the

tributed to two runs for BGSU. Both runs were 
scored without a single hit from the Falcons. 

IPFW would tome alive again in the lourih 
with hits from (lark and Angela I'astpiali. (lark 
was caught stealing and Pasquali was left on
