'Get Involved' 

showcasings 

organizations 



One the most reliable ways 
for us as students to interact with 
one another-besidea talking with 
different people, emailing, and 
being a spectator for our team 
spoils is joining an organization. 

Currently, IPFW has 94 
groups and counting, which range 
From culture to gaming. When you 
think of the number of organiza- 
tions presently here you maybe 
wondering why there isn't a vast 
majority of the campus pledging to 
these organizations or sponsoring 
events held by them. There is defi- 
nitely a need for us, as students, to 
make it our right to join an Organi- 
zation and be apart of the things in 
which these organizations bring to 
the student body. 

The Get Involved campaign is 
the kick-off to this concept. This 
event will be held March 1-5 
around campus. It is a way for the 
studenf body fo socialize and ask 
the questions that are on the 
minds, "Why should I join ihis 
organization?" 

Freshman Kyle Richmond 
said this effort is geared toward a 



be more unified. We'n 
interested. We want all students 
involved. If there's something you 
want to do, you may not have a 
clue about it, but we'll have the 
resources," Richmond said. 

Also it gives an idea of fhe 
gap and perceptions which need to 
be broken between students and 
the college experience is perceived 

"We're frying to get people 
awav-frnmxomingTn'hss, maybe- 
doing their two hours of studying 
here, and going home We're trying 
to attract more people to stay on 
campus and get involved. We're 
trying fo give a traditional college 
experience at a non-tradilinnal 
campus," Richmond explained. 

The college life should be on

'Historic' debate interrupts 
IPFW talks with legislators 



IPFW students, faculty and 
alumni wanting to thank their state law- 
makers and remind legislators of the 
school's existence were partially blocked 
Monday by a Republican boycott, 



Over 100 attended the IPFW 
Sratehouse Day/Higher 
Day in Indianapolis from 
sponsored by 



I dlK 



and 



included students from each state sup- 
ported campus - but the Fort Wayne 
university brought the most numbers. 
But the accomplishment was blunted by 
unscheduled legislator wrangling, lead- 
ing to both parties spending the majori- 



p.m., by which time buses back to I

State Democrats balked, refus- 
ing to allow a "blast motion," the 
Indianapolis Star reported Tuesday. The 
motion was set to force a debate on the 
proposed ban, but with it declined, the 
caucus turned into a day off for 
Republicans who wanted the ban as 
issue No. 1. Without that discussion, leg- 
islators of the Statehouse decided not to 
discuss any other pending bills or ideas.

A N.I.C.E Event: local employment expo 



dons, the Northeastern Indiana Career Employment Expo 
(N.I.C.E) look place recently at the Allen County Coliseum. 
Sponsored by a consortium of nine area academic insti- 
tutions the job fair allowed 36 area and national employers 
the opportunity to recruit fresh new college graduates and 

"This is the 13th year we've hosted this annual event," 
said Stuart Jones, Director of Career Services at Manchester 
College in North Manchester. "Our primary focus is on 
recent or soon to be area graduates and networking alumni. 
But, certainly the general public is always encouraged and 
welcome." 

"We're here looking fur thai gem that's ready to shine," 
noted Stephanie Cough, Certified Gemologist with Bradley 
Gough Diamonds in Fort Wayne. This was Bradley Gough 
Diamond's first visit to the N.I.C.E. event. "We don't have 
opening's often, so this is a rare opportunity for us." 

"It s not what you know, it s not who you know, L's 
who knows you,", echoed Cathy McGinnis, Coordinator of 
Employment Services at Indiana-Purdue University in Fort 
Wayne. "This is a chance for employers and job seekers to 
jn one and explore whether or not an entry level or

expanding rapidly." 

While sales oriented and customer 
ties in the financial service* sec tor with firms like Prudential, 
New York Life and AFLAC abound, probably the unique 
recruiting booth was hosted by Andy and Betsy Zenz of 
Crossroad Farms located in Hillsdale, Mich. "What we cater 
to is developing a relationship with lo t a I churches and youth 
ministries and work with developing productive young 
adults", said Betsy Zenz. "You won't get rich in our line of 
work. But, one will find it incredibU rewarding." 

One of the things that job fair seekers often overlook 
might seem quite trivial but it is incredibly important. 

"It is amazing how many job candidates never offer 
their resume to a prospective employer. The employer usu- 
ally has to ask for it", said Deborah Rohmke. Director of 
Career Services at Tri-State University in Angola and 
Chairperson of the event. 

Though a very serious sit- 
uation for those in attendance, 
Richard Baxtei 
Director of Students and 
of Career Services at 



Taylor University-Fort Wayne humorously interjected, "1 
have 325 resumes, how many do you want?" 

Initially projected to attract around 4iXl job seekers, "we 
have a number (hat exceeds ^=,0," exclaimed Roamke bub- 
bling with a prideful grin 'This reflects the normal lag time 
in a rebounding economy", quipped Baxter. 

While some employers were looking to fill key spots 
with ciuality talent very soon, most employers are t onlinunu; 
to pad their available pool of talent Irom which to expand 
with. "It's still an employers market right now; employers 
know (his and tend to conduct themselves accordingly" 

Not to lose heart, McGinnis sees a bright spot in this, 
"Most people don't see the big picture. The Fort Wayne 
Chamber of Commerce is projecting within the nexl five 
years the local labor force will be retiring 12,000 people.

Word of the Week: 
Constituents 



What constitutes an amoral act? According to Webster, amoral is "lacking a 
sense of right and wrong." This definition is too indistinct for use, as the idea of 
what is right and what is wrong is always subjective. Murder can be justified, 
theft can be necessary, and war is sometimes the only path to peace. 

It seems that in today's America, homosexual marriage is seen as no better 
than murder, theft, or war. Lately, the controversy of homosexual marriage has 
become more and more of a sore spot in American politics The situation has 
escalated to the point where states are amending their constitutions to outlaw 
same-sex marriages while, at the other end of the spectrum, San Francisco and 
Santa Fe are handing out marriage licenses like parking tickets. Senators are 
scrambling for a solution to this peaceful resistance and maintain their ratings 
in the polls. 

The main objection to gay marriage among the average Americans is that it is 
amoral. There is a general opinion thai homosexual behavior is harmful. This 
opinion, however, is based more on religion- ground- than any scientific data. 
Being a nation predominantly composed ol Christian \ oters, politicians, follow- 
ing the wishes of their constituents, lobby constantly for the il legalization of gay 
marriage or, as has become a more recent tactic, the amendment of the state con- 
stitution to distinguish marriage as the union between a man and a woman. 

On the other side of the story are the homosexual couples who yearn to have 
the same rights as heterosexual couples. Child custody and visiting rights at 
hospitals are two of those rights that come immediately to mind. Partners who 
have been together for years have no right to visit when one is critically ill in the 
hospital, or determine the treatment (or lack thereof) for each other: additional- 
ly, should that couple be raising a child together and the natural parent dies, the 
second parent has no lawful custody claim to the child that he or she may have 
raised since birth. 

Perhaps the solution to this problem does not lay in 'marriage.' Christian 
ideals say that marriage between two people of the same sex is a sin, and there- 
fore, under. thatname, gay 'marriage' will probably never be accepted in the 
United States. Perhaps it would be more acceptable tu the Chn-tian majority if 
same-sex couples ,,mld have -ome waj "t establishing a bond between them- 
selves, thus giving them the ability to claim custody and determine medical 
treatment, without calling it 'marriage.' 

Thus the idea of the civil union is proposed. Some may claim this is just anoth- 
er name for marriage, but it is fundamentally d liferent in that it is not a union in 
the eyes of the Lord, just in the eyes of the law - two things that should and 
hopefully always will remain independent of one another. A civil union would 
not necessarily have to include every single right that a marriage does; even a 
halfway gesture made by the American government is better than complete 
oppression of homosexual culture, and definitely would be a step in the right 
direction. 

In the case of homosexual marriage - or civil unions — what is right is not 
what is popular. Fifty years ago, a very similar battle was being fought: the pop- 
ular opinion was that African Americans did not deserve the same rights as 
Caucasian Americans, based solely on skin color Perhaps the two extremes on 
homosexual marriage can meet somewhere in the middle and work from there, 
eventually finding a solution that both parties find wholly acceptable.

At least it's not singing carrots: 

"The Passion" less of a 
mockery than most 



If one were to pick up the Bible, 
one would read stories about cre- 
ation, salvation, betrayal, adven- 
tures and great moral lessons. 

How is Gibson's film, a movie 
based on the Bible's literal story of 
the last days of Christ, blasphe- 
mous, while an infant playing 
Christ in his birth isn't? Dying is a 
human condition. Like it or not, 
we will all die eventually. Being 
born of a virgin mother? That's 
pretty damn miraculous. If I 
would take a guess as to which 
portrayed story would be mock- 
ing, I'd say the birth of Christ. 
That kind of stuff doesn't happen 
everyday, you know. 

On another point, at least in 
these two versions, humans are 
portraying the role of the Biblical 

Cartoon series uses vegetables to 
portray the characters taken from 
the "Word of God." I'll grant you 
that the show is indeed entertain- 
ing, and it's a good way to help the 
children learn about the Bible. But 
if we're gonna talk about blasphe- 
mous infants, let's allow the carrot, 
tomato, and cucumber to share in 
some of the wrath of an angered 
God. 

The whole point of a singing 
tomato acting out stories from the 
Bible, is that it gets children's 
attention. It gives them a character 
from whom they will watch and 
learn. It entertains children long 
enough that the stories will sink in 
and they can leam. This movie is 
entertainment that will teach 
adults the stories of the Bible. This 
is an avenue to grab the attention 
of adults long enough to teach 
them a few stories. 

Most of the uproar I've heard 
about this movie is from places 
outside of Fort Wayne, but I'm sure 
there are those of you who would- 
n't be caught dead watching this 
movie and feel it's a slap in the face 
of all you believe in. There are 
those of you whom I'm sure 
believe that Gibson and his actors 
have angered God and will be 
struck down in one sort or another. 
There are those of you whom I'm 
sure feel that no bigger blasphe- 
mous act has occurred in your life- 
time, but remember this: at least 
it's not a singing carrot being 
nailed to a cross. 



Many have talked about Mel 
Gibson's newly released film "The 
Passion of the Christ." Talk radio 
shows from coast to coast have 
spent countless hours dealing with 
the calls from both supportive and 
unsupportive listeners. I was driv- 
ing along in my car one day, listen- 
ing to WOWO, and I heard one of 
these shows, and it made me think. 

There was a lady who called in 
to say that any one person repre- 
senting Christ was blasphemous, 
and that no one should ever mock 
"the Savior" in such a way. The 
radio host was laughing at this and 
asked if she meant in this particu- 
lar movie or in any aspect of life. 
The woman clarified her statement 
by saying in any aspect of life. She 
held to the idea that portraying 
Christ was blasphemy and wrong. 

I thought about this for a 
moment and considered the fact 
that during the filming of Gibson's 
new movie, the actor portraying 
Christ himself was indeed struck 
by lightning while hanging on the 
cross, filming the crucifixion scene. 
I started to see it as a sign, when I 
remembered that some kid out in 
Nowheresville, U.S.A. got hit by 
lightening while standing outside 
during a thunderstorm. 

Lightning strikes happen, 

The radio host asked the 
woman if during the Christmas 
season, if someone has a living 
nativity scene, if it's wrong to have 
an infant in the manger playing the 
baby Jesus. She neither confirmed 
nor denied this, as the host went on 
to ask whether or not God would 
strike the infant down for blasphe- 

This whole ordeal started me 
thinking. I took a Classical 
Mythology class here on campus 
(an excellent course, you should 
try to squeeze it into your sched- 
ule), and I spent the entire Summer 
Semester reading about the stories 
of the Greek and Roman Gods. 
We read stories about creation, sal- 
vation, betrayal, adventures, and 
great moral lessons. 



Politics and the media: 

Idiot box provides only apathy and despair 



The problem with a lack of 
direction is that it effectively 
leaves one in a state of paralysis 
without any path of action. When 
you sit there without a reason to 
move everything else seems to 
pass by at light speed. 

But what are you supposed to 
do when you don't care? 

In a frantic attempt to think of a 
column idea, 1 got up early (that 
is, before noon) on Sunday to 
watch the political news maga- 
zines. FOX, ABC, CBS, I tried to 
watch as much as I could without 
getting disgusted. In a previous 
column I wondered if there was 
any reason to care about this 
year's moronic political land- 
scape. While I won't rule out the 
future, I still see nothing worthy 
of motivation. 

On "Face the Nation," Terry 
McAuliffe and the seemingly 
less-insane head of the 
Republican National Committee, 
Ed Gillespie, were baiting each 
other with pointless talk, and I 
grew increasingly angry at the 
idiotic circus event. I never knew 
that someone could talk (actually, 
it was more of a yell) for literally 
four or five minutes without tak- 
ing a breath until I heard 
McAuliffe. 

I turned the station over to 
"This Week" only to hear George 
Stephanopoulos talk about how 
this year's conventions were "a 
dream" for "political junkies." 

How sad, I thought and shook 
my head, political junkies. Why, 
I asked myself, would anyone 
bother to pay attention to poli- 
tics? 



It is not my intention to offend 
those who have dedicated their 
lives to the study of political sci- 
ence — we need someone to 
underhand this obtuse subject - 
but I dislike politics with as much 
passion as those who defend its 
necessity tor even' citizen. 

I have realized my tinKl.iment.il 
problem with politics lies not in 
my ignorance but what I know 
for a fact: that nothing I can do, 
and nothing I can say will in any 
way add to, or detract from the 
political process. Therefore, to 
debate about politics or to give a 
discourse over my political views 
(chosen at random, by the way) is 
such a waste of time that "poli- 
tics" should be outlawed from 
my vocabulary. 

So I sit here by myself as an 
unregistered, tax-payihg member 
of the "average folks" that John 
Kerry talks about in his stump 
speeches. 

I don't care, and I wouldn't be 
represented even if I did; apathy 
is the name of the game. 

Not only am I politically apa- 
thetic, I am culturally apathetic 

Last night around midnight I 
turned on the television to watch 
Saturday Night Live. In spite of 
the fact that SNL has not been 
funny in several years, I still tune 
in every once in a while to give 
the show another shot. 

Of course, Lome Michaels and 
his troupe of "comics" (in name 
only) presented the first and only 
skit I watched Saturday night; it 
involved the queen of class, 
Christina Aguilera, and the SNL 
cohort involved in a faux- 
Walgreen's commercial about — 
of all things — genital problems. 
Not only was it un-funny, it was 
crude and an absolute embar- 



[etters to the 



Hovind offers 

$250,000 for proof 

of evolution 



Is it true that the evolution doc- 
trine taught in every secular 
school is not really provable 
empirical science after all? 
Creation scientist Kent Hovind 
will be hosting a seminar in Fort 
Wayne on March 21 &amp; 22 at the 
Memorial Coliseum; Mr. Hovind 
is offering a $250,000 reward for 
anyone who can provide empiri- 
cal scientific evidence for evolu- 
tion. It seems that he has made 
this offer for quite sometime but 
no one has been able to cash in. 
Why? Based on what is being 
taught in the public school sys- 
tem cashing in on this offer 
should be as easy as taking candy 
from a baby. Surely someone 
somewhere should have some 
kind of "proof" that evolution is 
(he absolute truth about how 
everything came into existence. 

Is it really true that cosmic evo- 
lution cannot be proven empiri- 
cally? Cosmic evolution states 
that all matter came into being 
from nothing. Is it true that plan- 
etary evolution cannot be 
proven? This teaches that planets 
and stars formed from space 
dust. Is it true that organic evolu- 
tion cannot be proven? This 
teaches that all living matter on 

; earth evolved from nonliving 
atter. Basicalh 



no scientific proof for macro-evo- 
lution? This teaches that fish 
changed into amphibians, 
amphibians changed into reptiles 
and reptiles changed into birds or 
mammals. 

Kent Hovind's basic contention 
is this: Evolutionary teachers will 
point to variations within a kind 
of species and say this is proof for 
all of the above areas of evolu- 
tion. There are many species of 
birds but they are all still birds. 
Micro-evolution is observed, 
there are many changes within a 
kind which will form varieties of 
Species within a kind No one has 
evidence proving that any animal 
has changed into a fundamental- 
ly different kind of animal Nor 
has anyone ever observed life 
spontaneously arising from non- 
living matter. 

Harvard paleontologist Stephen 
Jay Gould in his book 
"Evolutions Erratic Pace in 
Natural History" has confessed 
that "The extreme rarity of transi- 
tional forms in the fossil record 
persists as the trade secret of 
paleontology The evolutionary 
trees that adorn our textbooks 
have data only at the tips and 
nodes of their branches, the rest is 
inference, however reasonable, 
not evidence of fossils." 

Those who are proponents of 
the theory of evolution would do 
well to admit that they believe in 
evolution, but they do not know 
it for fact. Many evolutionists 
come across like they have this 
mountain of empirical 
evidence to back them up in their 
itific" view point, when 
according to Dr Kent Hovind 
there is no such thing. Maybe 
these dear people should call 



a once-hilarious tele- 

As 1 said in a previous column, 
during displays of absolute 
moronic behavior (a la Super 
Howl haltiime show) mv genera- 
tion is (sadly) shown at their very 
best. This makes me angry; it 
makes me wish that there were 
something I could do to change 
what is happening to us. 

But what is the point? The Baby 
Boomers have made a mess of 
their children, their country and 
we now bide our time until we 
have to take care of them. If we 
watched ourselves the way we 
walch our television, I don't 
think we could handle the reality 
of what we have become. As a 
culture against the wall, the only 
method of advancement seems to 
be capitulation. 

As I read back over these words 
I realize that all of my examples 
of perception have come through 
the glass of a television screen, 
From Saturday night to Sunday 
morning it is amazing to think 
how much the media shapes how 
I see the world — how we all see 
the world. 

I have sat here immobile and I 
have relied on the television 
screen to tell me about the world. 
I think a lot of people have come 
to this same stagnation and used 
the television to leach themselves 
about the world. 

Perhaps the idiot box isn't the 
best instruction for America. 
Maybe apathy isn't the only 

I can give up and stay put in 
front of the television screen. 

Or I can tune it out and move 
on - but that's for another 



ditor 



evolution their opinion, or their 
viewpoint on how life came into 
being, or maybe even their "per- 
sonal faith." 

One must admire the great per- 
sonal faith of those who embrace 
evolution. Rather than believing 
that a Creator designed the uni- 
verse, the evolutionist believes 
the universe and all that is con- 
tained therein came from noth- 
ing. Now that is great faith, 
greater faith than any religion on 
the planet. But evolutionary 
teaching comes deceptively dis- 
guised under the cloak of science, 
rather than faith, and we know 
it's wrong to talk about ,i reli- 
gious faith when it comes to the 
question of origins. It seems peo- 
ple have simply exchanged reli- 
gious faith for a faith in nothing- 

I don't know about you, but if 
all people must exercise faith 
when it comes to the question of 
origins I will choose to place my 
faith in the risen Lord and Savior 
Jesus Christ whom the Bible pro- 
claims is the real designer behind 
the design of creation and He is 
the author of salvation for all 
who will believe. 

We are looking for people who 
would be willing to engage in a 
debate with Dr. Hovind on this 



March 22

is willing to debate up to three 
people at once, (or those interest-

Murpny. Some may say that his age hinders him and makes him look inexperienced and 
immature, but Murphy has proven to himself, the band and the crowd that he's ready to be 
serious. Many bassists are craving to play like he does. You can also always count on comi-

away from the way he drums on the keyboard. Also, when watching Ehinger sing, it makes

Give Mel a chano 



Gibson's crusade isn 

By Tim Rodgers 



So Jesus died on ,i cross? It's still just a 
movie, lulks Everywhere I turn all I hear is 
how Mel Gibson hates Jews, contemporary 
religion and dogs for some reason The 
movie |iist came out, and people protested it 
before they ever saw And you haven't even 
seen it! How can you protest something von 
haven't even seen yet! It's not Mel Gibson's 
fault lesus was crucified, so stop crucifying 
Braveheart already.

]esus netting his prayer on and arrested him 
; Peter went postal with a sword and cut one 

guy's ear oft, but Jesus told him to chill and 

healc-d the -oldier or mi the -lory goes. 

"Then Pilate handed ]e-us over to them 

to be crucified." John 19: Id Pilate gives Jesus 
' a "fair" trial and Jesus is condemned to 
i death. He is taken away, stripped of his 

clothing, beaten up, tied to a pillar and

Well, guess who they

Jesus meets His mother Mary, his moth-

the streets towards the mountain She weeps 
for Him and He consoles her as soldiers 
whip Him and push Him &lt;.m. She follows as 
her son, her only son carries a cross made of 
what would be equivalent to railroad tie&gt; 
today, towards His death. 

You have to imagine that, it was proba- 
bly close to 90 degrees in the Arabian sun. 
Sweat was pouring from His brow, mixing 
the blood from his brow. It was obviously 
not a good time A woman offered him a 
cloak and He wiped His face and continued 
on. If we had looked at the face of Jesus 
when He stood in the street, ivh.it would we

slanderous allegations of the 
leaders; a face masking a great 
mystery of love that would not 
relent from following God's 
will even to death. It's nearly 
impossible to say, but in the raw 
way it's being depicted it is the 
simplest notion. 

Jesus has reached the 
mountain; He is stripped of His 
remaining clothing and nailed 
to the wooden cross. He is 
hoisted high above the heads of 
a shouting crowd as they throw 
things at him. He looks towards 
the heavens and says "Forgive 
them father, for they know not 
of what they do." John 21: 13 
And He dies. Bleeds to death 
most likely. 

What 1 have just written 
here is the same thing Mel 
Gibson is doing, just in visual 
form. He is bringing one of the 
greatest stories of love to the 
screen in the rawest of senses, 
sugar coating nothing.

todays topic: and the award goes to... 



On Feb. 29 the 76th Academy Awards 
will air on ABC at 8pm. The Oscars, as 
they're affectionately known, is the most 

pn-.li&gt;;iuLi^ and honored award given to 
thosf in film, ll is a celebration of the vast 
amount of talent thai Holh wood showcases 
each year, i consider myself quite the movie 
buff, and I look forward to seeing who won 
what come 8 p.m., Sunday night. But right 
now, I'm looking to see what else is on. My 
hopes are up, becausr it seems that TBS will 
be running "Little Nicky." Perfect 

Right now you're probably questioning 
just how "bull I am about movies if I'm flip- 
ping through the TV Guide during the 
bi^.^e-t ni^ht of the I iolK wood year. Here's 



reserve (or people like I red Durst or Richard 
Hatch which are too horrible to mention. 

I don't hate the award shows for the 
award shows; I'm not a insecure prude 
whose offended bv a loose nipple or a hard- 
core indie fan who thinks that televised 
accolades are the utmost form of selling out. 
No, my beef is that the four hours plus that 1 
sit through the damn things are the most 
uncomfortable, embarrassing, stomach 
churning and vomit-inducing moments of 
television 1 have ever been victim to. Take 
this year's Grammy's for instance, which 
had enough cringing moments to last a life- 
Even with the five minute tape dela) in 
order to trhv.irl any Janet-like slip ups, there 
were still technical difficulties that left the 
viewers at home wondering who the hell 
was in charge. For instance, what the hell 
happened when Celine Dion's microphone 
n With the delay wouldn't y&lt; 



vhy the situation was painful 
One more thing (hat should have been 
evaded with the five minute time lapse is the 
weird silent stares in the camera many of the 
presenters unleashed, most notably when 
the show was coming back from the break. 
Maybe the cameraman forgot to say "action," 
because it took aboui len semnds for Queen 
Latifah to realize that she'd been staring 
blankly at a live TV audience. 

But the cm! blunders of (he night could 
not be remedied by a simple tape delay. 
Musical number-, should be outlawed from 
any award show that's not on MTV. What 
the hell was Sting thinking!'! Nobody, and I 
repeat NOBODY, wanted to see a Police clas- 
sic like "Roxanne" resurrected only to be 
butchered by letting the Reggae headache 
Sean Paul join in. Sting has a history of 
singing with complete losers; just a few 
years ago he sang "Every Breath You Take" 
with Puff Daddy (now known as the more 
"respectable" P. Diddy). Hopefully he will 



soon realize that the only way to truly sing a 
Sting song is to have sung by Sting, and 
Sting only. 

Who was the mastermind who thought 
up the great idea to have Celine Dion sing 
Luther Vandross' "Dance With My Father"? 
First off, it's Luther's song about his father, 
so who wants to see Celine singing it and 
having the nerve to show pictures of her 
father on the big Screen? I'm sure Luther 
was cringing at the sight. 

Perhaps the nvM pain invoking process 
of any award show is the "thank you" 
speeches. Does am one honestly care who 
the hell they thank' All anyone wants to see 
is who won. After the winner is announced, 
we're all just waiting for the speech to end. 
Its hard to imagine anyone on the edge of 
their seat unless their name might be 
thanked. I don't know about you, but I'm 
not expecting Bill Murray to say my name 
when he wins Best Actor (yeah shut up, he 
probably won't win. But he should, damnit). 

Another edition to the Gramnn gaffes 
would be the quick "Lifetime Achievement" 
awards to all the stars of yesteryear. 
"Lifetime Achievement" awards are tough. 
Now yes, those awarded should be award- 
ed. Music wouldn't be here today if it 
weren't for those mentioned. But the brevity 
used to announce them is offensive. Two 
presenters would come forward, and one 
would quickly say the name of the recog- 
nized then move on to the nominations for a 
different award, passing over their impor- 
tance as if mentioning them was simply a 
favor or an afterthought. Now I don't expect 
them to dedicate an entire segment to them, 
like the Golden Globes did to Michael 
Douglas (what an indulgent piece of fake 
sentimental crap that was), but 1 think the 
Grammy's could afford to give each 
"Lifetime Achievement" winner their own 
presenter. 

In light of this "thank you" speech 
catastrophe, kudos must go to Andre 3000 of 
Outkast for his acceptance speech at the 
Grammy's. After Outkast was announced as 
the winners of Best Rap Album, the camera 
frantically searched for the sight of Big Boi 
or Andre hugging, smiling, and walking to 
the podium for their acceptance. This con- 
tinued until the camera finally caught Andre 
walking up to the podium for what we 
expected to be a lengthy "thank you" to all 
his crew. But to my amazement and extreme 
gratitude, he simply took the trophy and 
offered a blunt "thank you" into the mike 
before walking off the stage. Perfection! That 
is what 1 like, just a thank you and be done 
with it. Thank you, Andre, for sparing us. 

So come Sunday, I'll watch Billy Cryst. 
open the show. I'll watch the nominations. 
I'll even watch the winner walk to the podi- 
um. But as soon as they grab that golt 
ue, you can bet I'll change the channel. 
Because I'd rather watch bits and pieces of 
the worst Adam Sandler movie ever made 
then watch a "chubby" Rene Zellweger gush 
over another award.

Asunexpt'i led as the i. in kings 
were to Simon, the loss total is even 
more. At 3-22, the Mastodons season 
is all but lost, however; according to 
Simon, Coach Noll says it is not 
always about victories. 

"He told us it's about getting 
better each game," said the center, 
"Not necessarily winning, but keep 
playing winning basketball. Its just 
about (continuing) to guarantee that 
you can keep playing hard each time 
lh.it you are nut on the court." 

Simon refused to make excus- 
es, but mentioned that playing an 
exceptionally harsh schedule - ci 



tough on the program. 
Two-guard Quinton Carouthers sepa- 
rated his shoulder during the seventh 
game; small forward Ric Wyand was 
ruled academically ineligible in mid- 
December; and shooting guard Terry 
Collins left the team for undisclosed 
reasons in early January. 

"With us being so close, we 
really just went on with our business," 
he said, "Obviously, we didn't stop 
talking to them (Wyand and Collins), 



Noll appointed Simon and freshman 



guard Beau Bauer as team captains. 
Although Noll believes Keion 
Henderson is the team's vocal leader, 
he would like Simon and Bauer to 
share that role when Henderson grad- 
uates after this season. 

"I'd like to think that some of 
the guys look up to me," said Simon. 
"I do more of my talking on the court 
than in practice. I might pull a guy off 
to the side and joke with him, but at 
the same time I'm making a serious 

When it comes to personality, 
Noll said that Simon is one of the best 
young men he has ever been around. 

"He is an articulate young 
man. He is very intellectual, quite and 
very polite. He is just a gentleman." 

Noll believes that because 
Simon is such an amicable person, it 
often works to the center's disadvan- 
tage. 

"It's kind of like off the court 
be Nice Dave, but on the court be 
Mean Dave," joked Noll. 



aggressive and physical on the defen- 
sive side of the ball. He added that he 
would also like for Simon to develop a 
Shaquille O'Neal type mentality in the 



"He got really physical with a 
guy one time and knocked him to the 
ground. But he got really worried and 
picked the guy up," said Noll. "I don't 
want him to step on the guy, but I 
want him to be physical." 

The head coach also said that 
if Simon works hard at improving his 
motivation and physical mentality in 
the off-season and during the 2004-05 
season, he could be a NBA draft pick. 

"It's up to Dave. We are going 
to lay everything out for him. He's got 
the ability to do it, he can do it, its just 



i matter of will he do it. It's

passive and takes some plays off. 
That is something that is important for 
him to understand he can't do," said 
Noll. 

Though the season is winding 
down and only one home game 
remains, Simon would like to see more 
fans and students at next season's 
home games. 

"I don't think a lot of students 
realize the caliber of that they have 
here at IPFW. They don't think that 
we are playing the same teams ihey

Leave Rasheed alone 



By Dan Vance 

The Communis 



i the leai 
highly touted rookie in 1995. He 
had spent his previous season as a 
sophomore at North Carolina. The 
same season that the Tar Heels 
went to the Final Four, And now he 
is nothing to the NBA. 

Well, nothing as some 



coaches and administrative facul- 
ties are concerned. We all know 
that Rasheed has from time to time 
had some run-ins with the law, but 
is he really such a "bad boy?" 

After a moderate rookie 
season as a Washington Bullet, 
where Wallace averaged just over 
10 points a game, he was dealt to 



high 19.3 points in 2000- 



felt that he was- 
n't contributing. 
So what hap- 
pens? After aver- 
aging 17 points a 
game for 45 
games, they 

dumped him, citing his "temper 
and role as a negative influence." 
What is so negative about 
me issues, but 

than half of the play* 
league. But at least he is good. 

So on Feb. 9; Wallace 
became an Atlanta Hawk. In 
return, the Trail Blazers received 
Atlanta's two best players and a 
point guard in Dan Dickau, that 
could be one of the greats with 



Portland, and a gre. 
Atlanta. After all, they now had 
one of the toughest and most 
feared men in basketball. 

And maybe that was too 
much for the Hawks to deal with. 
Ten days after they acquired 
Wallace, they shipped him up 



*s? 



. Just i 



hint that maybe 
much to handle. 

I mean, what bad could he 
have done. As of press time, the 
Hawks were the fifth worst team Ln 
the league. So how is it Wallace, 
who scored 20 points in his only 
appearance as a Hawk, could have 
any influence other than a good 

Not that I can complain 
much about his current position. 
Considering all of the talent now 
rotating in the Pistons lineup, they 
should be the heavy favorites to 



win the NBA title this year. 

Not to mention, the Pistons 
have always been the perennial 
"bad boys" of the NBA. And with 
Wallace, joining "Big Nasty" Corliss 
Williamson, Richard "Rip" 
Hamilton, Chauncy Billups and tne 
mean looking young European 
Darko Milicic, they may indeed be 
badder than ever. 

So I guess that Portland 
and Atlanta are the big losers. Then 
again, they usually are. But I can't 
feel bad for them. They didn't hurt 
Rasheed. They manipulated the sit- 
uation and in turn only hurt them- 

So when someone asks 
why they did this and that to 
Rasheed, the answer is simple. 
Because, nobody saw what I am 
seeing. 

Forget Shaq, forget Ron 
Artest, forget the rest, Rasheed 
might indeed be the baddest of 
them all. And no, that is not a bad 
thing at all.

IPFW-IUPUI rivalry game finishes out Mastodons' season 



Okay, so it's not Indiana 
versus Purdue, or Notre Dame 
against Boston College, or the 
Mulligan-Michigan St intrastate 
rivalry. But it could be. 

Throw out the records and 
consider this one to be the "1-69" 
rivalry. It will only take the IUPUI 
Jaguars (17-9) a few turns from 
their downtown Indianapolis cam- 
pus before they are on the highway

This is the second time 
IPFW and IUPUI will meet this 
season, with the Jaguars getting the 
best of the Mastodons 81-59 in

According to Noll, there 
will be several keys to executing 
the Mastodons' game plan for the 
March 1 showdown. 

Noll said he wants to

"I particularity don't like

of certain players this 
year," Noll said. 

Containing laguar
