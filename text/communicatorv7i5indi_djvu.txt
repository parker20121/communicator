EDITORIAL 

Deep Throat vs. Deep Throat II 

Students of IPFW are being ripped off again. Charles Pratt, "acting in the best 
interests of the students, has caused them to be paying $100 for "Deep 
Throat"-and no one will even see the flick on campus. 

Because of wlirii IV.iii limits ''(hi' possibility of a lot of people dumping a lot of 
monev" on this campus for a HPER or another classroom bunding, he refused to 
offer IPFW an R-rated film in the place of "Deep Throat," thus causing a $100

Why should 

a freshman at IPFW 

enroll in ROTC? 




Maybe the following 
statistics will help you 
answer that question. Of last 
year's college graduates, 40 
percent were unable to find 
employment within their 
major. And 20 percent were 
unable to find any job at all. 

Now compare that to 
these figures: all ROTC 
graduates are guaranteed 
employment immediately 
upon completion of school. 
98 percent of ROTC 
graduates are employed in 
their major field. Aren't 
those odds a little better? 



And that'snotall. During 
your junior and senior years 
at IPFW, you will be paid 
$100, per month. Plus S450 for 
6 weeks of Advanced Camp 
between those two years. 
Spending money you can use. 



You made a good choice 
when you picked IPFWas 
your college. Now take one 
more step into the future and 
choose ROTC. Call U.S. 
Army ROTC, Ft. Wayne, at 
422-7808. Or stop by our booth 
on the ground floor of Kettler 
Hall.
