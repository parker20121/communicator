Fiscal management agreement 

Three things are certain in life; death, taxes, and tabling of the fiscal 
management agreement for IPFW by the l.U. Board of Trustees. *" 
last week, some people died, others paid I 
agreement again. 

The l.U. irustees' action, or lack of action, on the fiscal managemenl 
agreement is getting harder and harder to understand or explain. Chancellor

The trustees' latest non-action apparently caught everyone by surprise, 
including I U. President John Kvan and Executive Vice President Cicarge I'lnndl 
Purdue President Arthur Hansen told a Communicator reporter last Thursday that 
the issue was settled and the agreement would be in effect after the November 1 
I U board meeting. He obviously is surprised.

newspaper are tickled to death. 

The l.U. trustees have been understandably cautious in dealing with Purdue 
Treasurer Fred Ford The words "good faith" are inoperable with him. But the 
agreement on IPFW is in writing, with additional assurances from Messrs, 
Schwartz and Pinnell Dial I.U.'s interests will be protected. 

The fiscal management agreement tor IPFW is a must. The universities have 
already reneged on liietr pi omiso to seek Cencral Assembly approval for a single 
allocation and unified budget for the Fort Wayne campus. The present situation 
must be changed.

Student loans 

The Federally Insured Student Loan (FISL) program is in trouble because o I 
the high number'of defaults in loan repayments The &lt;.oner.il Accounting Office 
est, males (hat the defaults will total nearly one-hall billion dollars this year. The 
hill will have to be paid by the taxpayer. 

Under (he program, a commercial bank will lend money to a college student 
with interest and payments postponed until the student graduates. The 
Departnienl of Health, Kducation, and Welfare guarantees the loan lo the bank. If 
the hank cannot collect, the federal government pays off the loan. 

Congress is nol likely lo pick Up a half million dollars worth of defaults each 
year without seriously evaluating the value of the program. Contraction or 
elimination of the program will work hardships on college students, especially at a 
university like IPFW where more students have to pay their own way. 

Because of rising tuition and other college costs, students arc having lo Ikiitow 
more to gel through Then, when graduated, they find a restricted job market and 
light mone\ Loan repayments are difficult and, in many cases, nearly impossible 

Some students declare bankruptcy. Others request special d&lt; ferrinenls from 
the banks Still ollicrs jusl quit paving or try to hide by moving and leaving no 
turwarding address In any case Hie taxpayers get the bill for the defaults. 

Many of the defaults come from students who never finished school. To them 
the loan will not bring a return through improved employment. The money was 
t..ri..Aed against future earnings, which are no belter than past.

But, let's face It. The primary obligation lor decreasing I lie number of defaults 
lies with the students who borrow Too many students are spending now without

WOMEN'S 
SOFTBALL 



We are in the process of organizing a Women's 
Softball team to play on an intercollegiate level with 
other colleges and universities in the Tri-state area. 
Equipment and coaching have been donated, and we 
need interested women to fill the team. We will 
operate on a club basis this year, and hopefully 
progress to-a full Varsity sport, perhaps as early as 
next year. If you are interested, please come up to 
room 225 in the Student Union, or call 482-5351.
