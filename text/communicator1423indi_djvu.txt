students," Silva said 

A protest is being raised because of 
the way students are chosen for the 
IH-ogram. By using SAT scores and 
grade po\a\ averages, said Silva and 
Faulkner, the rest ol the students are 
discriminaledagainsL 

Both said they would rather not have 
the program at all. However, U there 
must be a program, they would like to

"There should be no crlleria to get

Another change Silva and Faulkner 
said would make the program ac-

Pond and others protest tax law as unfair

A federal tax law Ihal went into effect 

last year dealing with lood service 

workers has been labeled "unfair" by 

state rcpresentalive Phyllis Pond ol

law by Pond and stale represenlalives

Vaneta Becker of Evansvilla, Ralph 
Ayers of Cheslerlon and Barbara Engle

step in getting Congress to think about 
changing the low.

Pond said the law is a good idea, buf 
only if it can be done fairly and without 
discrimination against certain people. 
"In places where the tax is added on a 
credit card, Ihe waitresses make as 
much as IS percent in tips. The law 
would be okay if they could figure out a 
way not to pcnaliie people making less 



than eight percent in tips," Pond said. 

Some workers may tie paying taxes 
on money ttiey never made and this Is 
what Pond and ihe other represen- 
tatives ore most concerned about. 

"In the long term, the tax may force 
the slopping of all undeterminable 
tipping, which may not be all bod. The 
tip may just be added to the bill. The 
worker could (hen be paid the eight 
percent In their wages." Pond said. 

II the use of tips conlinuca the 
workers should report what they earn 

"Most ol the iKople gelling lips earn

Kettler clocks wrong 

By ROBERT COLL YER 
SlalfWrllET 

A visitor on campus might find it a curious phenomenon — slightly annoying, or 
Jusl trivial. But tt a person isn't in the habit of carrying a watch, (hat person may 
have a problem — campus clocks. 

"Yes, we have a problem," said Don Kaller, direclor of the physical plant 
"Thebulk of theproblem Is in Kettler Hall." 

Kettler has TS clacks, many of which are self adjusting, tied In with a campus 
master clock. Every hour the clocks correct Ihemsclves to conform with Ihe 
master clodi. 

The clocks are nearly 20 years ntd and many of thdr self adjusting mechaniima 

Kaller said his staff attempts to maintain accurate clocks In Ihe high traffic 
areas. With replacement costs running aboul $130 per unit, evoy effort l» made to 
salvage the original. 

Not all buildings are on the master system, Neff Hall converted a fewyeaa ago. 
But the Classroom and Kledlcal Building and others must rely on free-standing 
clocks, many of which arc battery powered. As the battery ages, accuracy Is af- 
fected. Since most of the clocks have adjustment stems, they can b« tampered 
with. 

Costs la convert campus buildinp to the master system are facton In their 
repair. To convert the CM Building; for example, wnild cost about 112,000, 

For now. dodis will be repabred as lime penults, "We're making progress," 
Kaller said.

Knight's supporters say he is a winner, 
and who con prove I hem wrong? With two 
NCAA, one NIT. and seven Big Ten cham- 
pionships under his bell. Knight's record Is 
impressive. But ills only one of the reasons he 
deserves n chance. 

Winning Is imporlanl. but it Isn't everything 
to Knlghl. He Is a disciplinarian ami teacher 
who tries to get the most from his players 
"Your opponent \s yoursoU. your polcnllnl." 
Knight once said. "1 coach against the game 
It's the game that licats you It you lool with 
II, it will kill you.'* 

Knight's 197S-7S lU team, with ull but two at 
its members from the previous year, was 
eipeeled to win many gomes because of the 
experienced reluming players. Knight, 
however, replied. "I don't expect there lo be 
any drop-off in the way we play. I'm not 
talidng about winning games I'm talking 

Knight also stresses education. With one 
exception, everyone who played under Knight 
for lour &gt;'ears has received his degree. Pii? 
were named academic a 1 1- Americans. A 
doctor, an accountant, one dental and two law 
school students played under Knight at lU. 
Two players on this year's team, Tod Kllchel 
and Randy Witlman, are graduate students In 
business. 

Those who oppose Knight don't like him 
berating his players In practice or in a game. 
No doubt, one must have thick Bkln to play 
under Knight Some who found that out 
transferred lo other universities lo ploy 



baikelball. Knight kicked three others oil the 
197B-79 team for smoWng marijuana. That 
team, however, managed to win the National 
Invllallon Tournament iNlTi. 

Many think Knight Is Inslcless in scolding ' 
ptajtrs and referees But Ihcy forget about 
the trust fund he set up for tjndon Turner 
when Turner was crlpjjled In an automoblie 
acddcnU Tliey forget Knight housed Steve 
Boudile alter Douchle's mother died 

Most of those who object to Knight coaching 
In the Olympics critlclle his off-court actions. 
In one 1979 inddcnl In Puerto Rico, Knight 
was convicted of assaulting a police officer 
while coaching the U.S. team in the' Pan* 
American games. In another, he shoved a 
. man against a hotel wall near Philadelphia. 
(Some said he threw the man into a garbage 
can.J Critics say Knight will embarrass the 
U.S. Ifsuchoutbreaksoccur In Los Angeles In 

What Knight did may be odd. but In a July 
Z3, 1979 Sports Illustrated article. Knight said 
he reacted In self-defense aAer the poiiccnian 
))lt htm In the eye when ordering 
Knight's players off the court with 15 minutes 



playinf 



lelcft- 



the Philadelphia incident, Knight 
Claim ea ne threw the man against a hotel wall 
for yelling otecenllics at Knight. "I think 
society ha^ liecn so lolerable of everything. 
We Just say 'to hell with It' and let it go. Do I 
have lo walk away from that stuIP No 
way!.. I'm very disciplined at saying things I 
mean I don't have lo go back very olten and 
say I didn't mean something," Knight said 
alter the Incident. 

Knight Is not di[domatic. But he has the 
guts to say what he feels and slick to his word. 
He won't be a quiet little boy inUlnl9B4. If a 
referee makes a call Knight disagrees wiiJi, 
Knight will let him know about It. Knight will 
get the most out of his team whether it wins or 
loses. He'll also show the world whal honesty 
rail, I,

Off-court antics will harm U.S. 



Those who support Indiana University's 
Bobby Knight as coach ol the United States 
Olympic basketball team usually point lo his 
coaching statistics. Hie followers point out 
how many games his leams have won, how 
many oatlanal championships lU has won or 
how many No Iteomshehos coached. 

The reasons for not having Knight as 
Olympic team coaeh are not based on 
statistics. TlieTe ore no concrete basketball 
itata to use against Knight. He developed 
leami that win games, there Is no argument 
b thai regard. 

The Olympics, though. Involve more than 
Just winning games. The Olympics are 
idealist Ically played to promote good, solid 
relalloDshlps among the countrlo par- 
ticipating. Knight cannot be tiuited to 
promote those relalinnshliB. 

The famous inddeot in Puerto Rico In 
which Knight supposedly assaulted a police 
oWicw Is proof of Knighfs inability lo get 
along v.ith people. The facts of the case 
protmbly will never be known. A'hal is known 
is Knlghtha railed the sIbialiDD wrongly. 

If Knight didn't cause the Uuldent. or. lithe 
pollcemim came at him first (as Knight hu 
dflimed), then Knight should have gotten out 
of the litualloa In some way otiier than 
violence. That may not have beoi what i 
"tough coach" would do, but 11 is what a 
&lt;£plomatJc coacb would do. 

Everyone d(Ber\-es the benefit of the doubt 
and Knight got that chance. Rectntly asked 
atiout the tnddent. he said he "mooned" the 
people from the airplane window wben he Idl 
the country because that was the la St thing he 
wanted them to lee. This was probably Just a 
Joke, but Knlghlibouldn't laugh these thlngi 



off so easily. 

Through the years. Knight has pushed 
players around and degraded them In the 
press. Recently, Knight criticixed Big Ten 
referees, saying how bad they were at of- 
fldaUng the games. Can we eipcct Ibis man 
to keep his remarks to hlmscU if something 
goes against him at the Olympics? 

The 0l&gt;7nplcs are a time for friendly 
compelltion between countries, a time lor 
them to put aside old disputes. Bobby Knight 
causes imputes. On the court. Knight should 
be free to do what he has to for his team. But 
It's off the court where he ends up In trouble. 
An Olympic coach needs to represent the 
United Slates both on AND off the court. 

Knight may tie one of the most triumphant 
coadies In college baikelball. but does that 
make him the best coadi for the Olympics? 
The altitude of a lot of people Is "winning is 
the only thing." The Olympics are more 
Important than that. II winning is what people 
are worried about, the U.S. Olympic 
basketball team has lost the gold medal only 
once, in the controvTrslal 1971 Cames. How 
many of those gold medal-teams were 
coached by Knight? 

There are other coaches In the U.S. whoare 
Just as good u Knight. The Olympic coach 
should be selected on his record as a coach 
and a person. 

Dean Smith coached the 1976 Olympic 
team and represented the United States well. 
He was crilictecd tor his selection of players 
and the wayhe coached, but hedidn'I gel Into 
any fights or "moon" anyone. His team won. 

For every Bobby Knight there Is a Dean 
Smith. The United States should look beyond 
stalisttca and pick the best penon for the Job.
