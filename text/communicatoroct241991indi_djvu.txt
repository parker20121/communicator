By Tina Holston 
Editor In Chief 

IPFW, along wilh other universities in 
Indiana, has instituted a policy to 
address the issue of Acquired Immune 
Deliciency Syndrome. The policy 
states that the chancellor will make 
decisions "that relate to the compatibili- 
ty of an infected person with campus 
life." An IPFW AIDS Information Com- 
mittee has also been created to coordi- 
nate and disseminate information about 
AIDS to the campus community. 

"We got recommendations from the 
Stale Board ol Health, the American 
College Health Association and the 
Center for Disease Control and decid- 
ed that we needed to do this before the 
issue came up directly and someone 
said What is the policy?'," said Chan- 
cellor Joanne Lantz. "From what I read 
in the newspapers, eventually it will be 
a problem on campus." Lantz said she 
knows ot no HIV positive persons or 
cases of AIDS on campus al this time. 

"I hesitate to use Ihe word problem in 
relation to AIDS." said Lantz. "It is an 
issue we will all need to attend lo 
because the numbers of HIV-infected 
people have greatly increased. 

AIDS is a disease that potentially 
affects everyone, it is no longer consid- 
ered a disease which attacks only 
specified groups of people. Anyone 
can get AIDS regardless of age, sex, 
sexual preference or race, said Jack 



Ryan, executive director of the Fori 
Wayne AIDS Task Force. "I tell people 
that the only people who are safe are 
drug-free virgins," said Ryan. 

He said he believed AIDS awareness 
is especially important for college-age 
people, "These are (he people who 
tend to get drunk and high," said Ryan, 
"the type ol behavior which can impair 
decision making when it comes lo sex." 

The IPFW policy on AIDS has several 
major points. It states that "the partici- 
pation of persons intected with the HIV 
virus in various aspects ol campus life 
... should be determined on an individu- 
al basis, utilizing Ihe latest available 
information from Ihe Indiana State 
Board of Health, Ihe American College 
Health Association and Centers for Dis- 
ease Control. Situations that place an 
infected member of the university com- 
munity at risk for his/her own health will 
be considered individually." and "action 
compatible with university student and 
personnel policies may be taken to pro- 
tect the student or employee." 

The policy also says that "IPFW does 
not intend to require HIV antibody test- 
ing of individual students, faculty or 
slalf, unless it is required by law, by the 
Indiana State Board ol Hearth, by the 
Trustees, or by presently unforeseen 
but exceptional circumstances." 

"The policy is to protect people who 
do not have AIDS from getting it and 
for those who do have it lo protect their 



Campus safety week 
focuses on awareness 



By Tammy Rasnlck 
News Editor 

Next week IPFW students will have 
the chance lo increase their awareness 
of personal salety. 

Various departments on campus and 
community organizations will be spon- 
soring informative programs for stu- 
dents throughout Personal Safety 
week, which is Ocl. 28 lo Nov. 1 . 

This is the first time that there has 
been a collective week-long program 
about personal safety on campus. 

According to Steven Roby, cam- 
pus chiel of police. 'The purpose of 
personal safety week is to raise the 
consciousness of students, staff 
and faculty." 

The tirst program offered will be 
"Against Her Will," presented by the 
Center for Women and Returning 
Adults on Monday. Oct. 28, at noon. 
There will be a 45-minute film on date 
and acquaintance rape followed by a 
panel discussion. 

The second workshop on Tuesday 
will focus on how lo reduce office and 
environmental problems such as 
reflections on VDT screens, improper 
keyboard height and chair discomfort. 

There will also be a live interactive 
teleconference called "Suicide: A New 
Hope Through Science." The telecon- 
ference will address issues concerning 



a problem on campus and throughout 
the general population. The confer- 
ence is sponsored by the IPFW Well- 
ness Council and Substance Abuse 
Council. 

The third day ol Personal Safety 
Week will feature a workshop titled "Be 
Safe." Sponsored by ihe Cenler for 
Women and returninq Adults and Cleri- 
cal Service Staff Advisory Committee, 
the workshop will provide information 
about home safety, self-defense, thell 
protection and safety on Ihe street. 

Police and Safely are sponsoring 
Personal Protection Instruction on 
Thursday. The workshop will teach 
women effective personal protection 
techniques, according lo Roby. 

On Friday Fire Extinguisher Instruc- 
tion will show participants how to use a 
fire extinguisher in case of a fire emer- 
gency. The instruction, also sponsored 
by Police and Salety, will take place in 
parking lot 3. 

Roby had high expectations for the 
week,, "I would like to see a lot ol par- 
ticipation." Roby felt that students and 
staff should lake advantage of the 
instruction that will be available 
throughout the week. He hoped that 
by providing these workshops the per- 
sonal safety consciousness will be 
raised.

dignity and privacy." said Lantz. 
The IPFW AIDS policy begins with 
some basic tacts about the disease; it 
explains the symptoms and the differ- 
ence between being HIV positive and 
having AIDS. "Some persons infected 
with the (HIV) virus develop AIDS, 
while others develop AIDS-related 
symptoms, which include persistent 
fever, weight loss, lymph-gland 
swelling, diarrhea, fatigue, and neuro- 
logical impairments," according to the 
policy statement. The statement also 
says that many Individuals who are HIV 
infected remain symptom free. 

"AIDS infection is not a serious risk in 
Ihe university environment. It is likely 
to occur if persons who have been 
exposed to the virus are engaged in 
needle-sharing or sexual activity. Cur- 
rent information indicates that an infect- 
ed person does not endanger others by 
remaining in class, laboratories, clinical 
settings, students organizations, or 
work environments," according to Ihe 
policy, which is printed in Ihe IPFW 
Student Handbook lor 1991-92. 

The IPFW AIDS Inlormation Commit- 



tee is primarily lor AIDS education. 
"Most of our efforts are to inform peo- 
ple in the campus community about 
AIDS," said chairman James Ferguson. 
"We participate in an annual health (air 
on campus, we show films with ques- 
tion-and-answer sessions, and we pul 
out an annual pamphlet on AIDS," he 
said. So far this semester the commit- 
tee has not held any meetings or spon- 
sored events, and there probably will 
not be any until next semester, said 
Ferguson. 

Both Indiana University, Bloomington, 
and Purdue University, West Lafayette, 
have AIDS policies and some kind ol 
campus organization for AIDS educa- 
tion. Dr. Hugh Jessup, director ol I.U.'s 
health center and chairman of the AIDS 
Task Force on the Bloomington cam- 
pus said, "HIV awareness is very 
important today. A tew years ago 
knowing you were HIV positive didn't 
help because there was nothing you 
could do. Now knowing your status is 
significant because drugs like AZT can 
add years to your life," said Jessup. 
Indiana University in Bloomington has 



a university AIDS policy similar to 
IPFWs In that decisions are made on a 
case-by-case basis, said Jessup. "Our 
policy was created as an entitlement lo 
university services," he said. The poli- 
cy was nol created to restrict the activi- 
ties of those with HIV positive or AIDS. 
"The purpose is to find alternative ways 
to enable them to continue to attend 
classes, attend sporting events and so 
forth," said Jessup. 

"What people often don't understand 
is that a person who is HIV positive is 
as healthy as you and I. It's when 
AIDS actually begins to alfect the body 
that a person may need these ser- 
vices," Jesup said. He said the policy 
Indiana University has been very sup- 
portive in providing things like 
wheelchairs lor students with AIDS. 

Purdue also has adopted "AIDS on 
Ihe College Campus," written by the 
American College Health Association 
as its policy. The campus AIDS com- 
mittee is now defunct, but AIDS edu- 
cation continues at Purdue through 
the health service. "We have a sexu-

Workshop utlizes metaphors 



By Tammy Rasnlck 
News Editor 

When you are feeling bad or out or sorts, 
would you ever consider using a metaphor lo 
(eel better? On Monday Nick Martin held a 
workshop on how to do just that. 

Martin, who is a counselor, international lectur- 
er and author of "An Operator's Manual for Suc- 
cessful Living," explained in his workshop, "Mag- 
ic with Metaphors," how to use metaphors as a 
technique to help you "feel belter when you feel 
bad." 

Martin explored the differences between good 
and bad feelings. Bad feelings, he said, stress 
the physical body. This idea is essential to using 
the metaphor technique. A metaphor is a figure 
of speech in which a word denoting one idea is 
used in place of another. 

When using the metaphor technique, a per- 
son determines where in their body they feel the 
stress from their bad feeling. They then turn 
that feeling into a metaphor. One participant In 
the workshop said that his feeling of fear was a 
big, rough, hollow ball in the middle of his stom- 



ach. 

After the metaphor is obtained, Martin stated 
that the person should then find some way, with- 
in the frame of the metaphor, to get rid of it. For 
example, the man who had the hollow ball In his 
stomach invoked magical powers to destroy the 
ball. After the ball was destroyed, the man said 
the fear was gone. 

The metaphor technique is included in what 
Martin calls the toolbox of life: tools essential to 
live a successful life. Martin stated, "Mental- 
health counseling is a type of education; it's pri- 
vate tutoring about how to live." 

Martin pointed out that 80 percent of counsel- 
ing time with his patients is spent on coming to 
terms with bad feelings. If "you can learn to do 
that on your own. that's a savings of 80 per- 
cent." 

Martin's week-long stay in Ft.. Wayne included 
a workshop at the YWCA and the 3-Rivers Cen- 
ter Service, and an appearance on Channel 
21's, "Live Line" TV show. He will conclude his 
visit as a guest speaker at "The Wings of Spirit" 
retreat Oct. 25 through 27.

Campus AIDS policy lacks foresight 



Once again a hall-baked idea 
storms IPFW with the new AIDS poli- 
cy created Ihis year. Chancellor 
Lantz, on the advise of a handful of 
local and national health organiza- 
tions, decided a policy to address the 
issue ot AIDS was necessary. Per- 
haps Ihey ace right, but the idea 
doesn't seem lo have been well 
thought out. The policy says Ihe 
chancellor will make decisions on the 
"compatibility ol an infected person 
with campus life* on a case by case 
basis. 

First of all, what makes the chancel- 
lor of a university an authority on 
AIDS? Even if she has the advise of 
medical and legal counsel, what busi- 
ness does she have making deci- 
sions concerning someone else's per- 
sonal life? It is common knowledge 
(and it was stated in Ihe policy) that a 
person cannot get AIDS Irom casual 
contact (such as classroom or work- 
place participation) with an HIV posi- 
tive person; yet the administration 
deems it necessary to conlrol a per- 
son's freedom of activity on campus 
just because they are HIV positive. 

What will happen if she determines 
an infected person is not compatible 
wilh IPFW? She doesn't seem to 
know. All she said was that, "We are 
dealing with reasonable people mak- 
ing reasonable decisions based on 
Ihe best information we have." She 
doesn't seem to have much informa- 
tion at all, at least not on her own pol- 
icy. The entire policy statement, oth- 
er ihan ,the basic facts listed abouj 
AIDS a'nd its symptoms, is very 
vague, 'it appears lo have been writ 1 
ten more lor the benelil ol Ihe admin- 
istration rather than any students or 
employees. The chancellor must be 
very concerned wilh university liability 
and the cost ol insurance to imple- 
ment a policy that doesn't mean any- 
thing and is impossible to enforce. 

In an interview wilh a The Commu- 
nicator reporter, she said Ihere are no 
known persons with HIV or AIDS on 



campus. How does she expect to 
find out if there are? Any reasonable 
peison is not going lo come forward 
on his or her own accord and say "I 
have AIDS, scrutinize my life." 

Lantz said, "We aren't out lo get 
anybody." She said the policy will 
protect Ihose that do not have it from 
getting it and protect the dignity and 
right to privacy ol those who do have 
AIDS. How does she expect to do 
either? It is quite impossible lo pre- 
vent a person's contracting AIDS 
unless you can control their sexual 
conduct and prevent them Irom using 
I.V. drugs. If she has figured out a 
way to do either one, she is an expert 
on AIDS and should share her 
secrets. Likewise, it is difficult to pro- 
tect peoples' right to privacy while 
asking them to tell a committee of six 
that they have AIDS, then letting that 
committe make a decision determin- 
ing their right to an education equal to 
those who do not have AIDS, or who 
have not come forward. 

The comittee itself is another prob- 
lem. Three ol its members (the exec- 
utive director of university relations, 
the director of personnel and payroll 
services, and the chancellor) are ex 
officio, meaning by virtue of the office 
they hold— not by virlue of their 
knowledge of AIDS. Again the prob- 
lem ol lack of expertise arises. Alter 
all, will they be asked for their AIDS 
credentials before getting hired? It 
appears these are conveniently the 
same administrators who deal almost 
exclusively .with public relations. This 
was probably not an accident. 

The" administrations oM.U. Bloom- 
ington and Purdue. West Lafayette, 
both created their policies and com- 
mittees wilh education and advocacy 
in mind; and they seem to be imple- 
menting them with effectiveness and 
compassion. Perhaps the chancellor 
and her committee need to make an 
offer of public assistance rather than 
slashing the issue away in a hand- 
book.

Letters To The Editor 



Students need to be considerate in garage 



To The Edllor: 

This is an open letter to all those indi- 
viduals who insist on stopping their 
cars in the middle ol the parking 
garage, wailing for some poor slob to 
linish backing out ol a parking space, 
and meanwhile blocking traffic behind 
them. 

Do you people realize this is nol only 
inconsiderate as hell, but dangerous? I 
have nearly rear-ended, or boen rear- 
ended by, vehicles that had to come lo 
a sudden slop due to a car wailing in 
the middle of the driving lane for a 
space to become free. This is bad 
enough in an open parking lot, but in 
the garage, there is no avenue of 

New Fun Size 



escape Irom vehicles blocking the 
path, you cannot simply back up and 
go Ihe other way, and many times 
there is no room lo drive around Ihe 
oflending vehicle. There is also no 
avenue of escape for drivers heading 
your way who don't realize traffic is 
slopped, and therelore may nol have 
time to stop their cars before they hit 
you^, 

Sil and look at your watch for five 
minules sometimes while sitting in your 
car - time does not fly! This is the situ- 
ation I have frequently been in while 
wailing for someone to finally pull into 
the space they have been waiting for, 
Since there ate elevators on every floor 



ol the garage, is any one space really 
Ihal much more convenient than anoth- 
er? I'd gladly drive lo Ihe lop floor

for five minutes sometime 
while sitting in your car - time

several minutes belore moving my car

Today I saw that somewhere in Ihe 
garage - I don't recall which floor - 
someone had lelt his or her car, unat- 
tended, in the palh of traffic. Fortu- 
nately, the car was far enough lo one 
side that other cars could pass by. I'm 
thankful I doni encounter situations like 
this often. I'm also thankful Ihal so far, 
no accidents have happened in the 
garage due to other people's rudeness. . 
T h|owever,,lhe potential tor a mulli-c.df'

happens, the individual who caused it 
by blocking traffic had better have good 
insurance, a good lawyer, or bolh!

Here are handy tips for bored commuters 



By Jim Walker 
Managing Edllor 

Like many IPFW students, I travel 
some distance each day to school. 
Thankfully, I've developed a few tricks 
that make the commute from my Skokie, 
Illinois home seem quicker. 

And because I'm such a genuinely 
nice person. I'm going lo share these 
time-passing tips wilh you, the reader, 
freeol chargel Take notes. 

1. CAR POOLING - One line way to 
make a drive seem shorter is lo share 
the drive wilh a friend, neighbor of 
drtfler. Although picking up hitchhikers 
or others who seem to need a ride 
might be good fun and definitely time 
passing, it can also be dangerous. So 
we'll skip right to the part about riding 
with a friend or neighbor. 

One Ihing to remember in picking a 
car-pooling buddy - find a sane one. 
Find a person who listens. Find a per- 
son who will actually slop talking about 
his or her problems at some point. And 
lind a person who is the exact opposite 
of me. 

To offer an example ol a person to 
select as a car-pooling buddy: MacGyver. 
This is a man who know s a lot ol stuff, 
and fix your car il il breaks wilh some 
gauze and scotch tape, and most 
importantly, he Is shy and he never, 
ever brags. 

To offer an example ol a person lo 
never consider In a thousand Slrom 



Thurmond lifetimes: Me. I'm the kind 
ol guy who is still wandering around 
asking people "So, who are you for, 
Clarence Thomas or Anila Hill?" I'm 
the kind of guy who will brag about how 
he never studies more than seven min- 
utes for his exams and still gels A's.

So, il you do pick a passenger pal, 
slick to a MacGyver dude. Or some- 
one nice lo look over at, say Julia 
Roberts or Rob Lowe depending on 
your prelerence. 

2 STREET SNACKS- Ealing on the 
road always seems to make liips short- 
er. One, it gives your moulh something 
lo do, and Iwo, it gives your brain 
something to do. "What was Ihal I just

I usually slop along the trip at McDon- 
ald's to entertain myself wilh a Value 
Meal. The lood from McDeath's 
always seems better when eaten while 
driving. Maybe it's because you can't 
look al it as much. 

Even though Value Meals are only 
S3 id. ealing oul all of the time can get 
expensive. So, I have created my own 
commuting snack. Here is ihe recipe. 
It is slightly more nutritional Ihan a Value 
Meal. 

CHEX COMMUTER INSTANT 
DEATH/PARTY MIX 
Mix; 

1/4 lb. Crisco 

1/2 lb. Skillies bile size candies 
1/8 lb. Rolos 

-a dash ol crumbled Smarties 
-a bottle ol Red While and Blue Beer 
-add a box of any Chex cereal 
-and a fisllull of anchovies (optional) 
Bake on a Pam-soaked cookie sheet 
for 13 minutes or until golden brown. 
Serve from a grocery bag. Feeds one 
commuler. 

3. PUTTING ON THE HITS - Anolher 
fun Ihing to do while driving the ledious 
miles is singing along to music. Sure, 
you may appear strange when a per- 
son passes and sees you looking very 
emotional while singing like Lou Grahm 
doing "Urgent," But who cares? 
I do recommend thai all commuters 
lape themselves singing in Ihe car just 
as a reminder - you do sound like Bob 
Dylan wilh a wet, hacking cough. Don't 
start gelling cocky and thinking aboul 
starling a college band. There's 
already REM (In case you missed Ihe 
joke (here, I'm insinuating lhat Ihe 
Ironlman for REM sings a lot like Bob 
Dylan with a wet. hacking cough. 
Although I'm sure he is a very nice 
individual. Thank you. J 

4. TALKING ON CAR PHONE (jerks 

5. TALKING ON FISHER-PRICE 
PLAY PHONE (wanna-be jerks only) - 



Must also have one of Ihose fake car 
phone antennas on Irunk. 

6. READING OR STUDYING - 
Although I've spoken to many com- 
muters who claim to read or study 
while driving. I rarely ever do so. 
Maybe that's because I shudder when 
recalling Ihe lime I was studying for a 
Sociology mid-term withoul paying 
much attention to my driving. Imagine 
my surprise when I looked up from my 
book to see that I'd been cruising along 
in the median at 65 tor several milesl 

7. THINKING DANGEROUS COM- 
PULSIVE THOUGHTS - Ever do Ihis? 
It's wackyl Sometimes while driving 
along on Ihe highway, compulsive 
thoughts will permeate my conscious- 
ness. "What would it sound like lo be 
crushed by that huge semi-truck?" I 
somelimeslhink to myself. Or "Would I 
survive if I ramped Ihe car over Ihal 20- 
lool embankment doin' 90?" 

Hey, try il somelime. Thinking dan- 
gerous compulsive thoughts can be 
really lunl 

8. HARASSING JERK DRIVERS - 
This is my favorite! I like to go after 
drivers who have really bright halogen 
lights lhat burn my eyes like lasers 
reflecting off their rear-view mirror. I 
like to go alter idiols who drive slow in 
Ihe left lane of a lour-lane highway. 
And I like lo go after drivers who 
appear timid or vulnerable in some 

drivers?" you may ask. I harass the 
heck out of them. I lurch within inches 
ol their back bumper and flash my 
brlghts. I swerve in front of Ihem, cut- 
ling Ihem olf and sending Ihem rolling 
inlo a dilch. I hold up pre-made signs 
with messages like 'Stay out ol Left 
Lane or Die!" or "Your Lights Hurt My 
Sensitive Eyes, Now I KILL Youl" 

This activity, needless lo say, passes 
Ihe time quite nicely. 

IN CONCLUSION - I'd like to offer a 
bil of advise: Never, EVER end a 
speech, paper or anylhing with a tinal 
statemenl starling with these two 
words- In Conclusion.

Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts 

Folk Opera brings ancient traditions to Fort Wayne 



By Tammy Rasnlck 
News Editor 

The deep resonating drums pounded. 
Cymbals splashed with a mystical 
chime. Six petite Tibelan women 
dressed in elaborate, brocade cos- 
tumes sang in pealing voices that 
chimed like bells. They danced with lit- 
tle steps in a circle. Their male part- 
ners in similar costumes surrounded 



them and picked up the song where 
the women left off. ThBir voices were 
similar to the drums: deep, clear and 
fhylhmical. Their faces were intense 
as they concentrated on their words 
and the delicate soft steps of their 
dance. They paired off and the maid- 
ens offered their partners imaginary 
drink. The men accepted with a smile, 
they all laughed and continued in their

song. 

Sounds like a National Geographic 
documentary doesn't it? It all hap- 
pened right here at the IPFW Athletic 
Center last Friday night. As part of 
their 1991 World tour, the Tibetan Insti- 
tute of Performing Arts performed the 
Lhamo Folk Opera of Tibet. 

The TIPA functions under the aus- 
pices of Ihe Council for Religious and 
Cultural Affairs ol his Holiness, the 
Dalai Lama, lis main purpose is to pre- 
serve the music, dances and theatrical 
traditions of Tibet. The world tour is 
part of a celebration of the International 
Year of Tibet, declared by the Dalai 

The evening's performance was 
spectacular. It was like stepping 
across the globe into another world, 
another culture. Watching the group, 
so dedicated to preserving Iheir rich, 
elaborate heritage, no doubt tugged at 
the heart of the audience. And as the 
entire audience stood lor the Tibetan 
National Anthem, it was as if Ihe 
boundaries o! cultural ditferences were 
erased, and lor a moment, it was just a 
room full of people enjoying a beautiful 
song.

AIDS 



AIDS continued from page 1 
ally transmiited disease awareness 
program called 'Would You Lie to 
Have Sex?" said Trudy Morritz, Pur- 
due's director ol health promotion 
programs. "This is a program pro- 
duced by students for students. We 
train Interested students lo present 
the facts to their peers," she said. 
Recent research indicated that many 
college students lie about their past, 
she said. It's about a 50/50 chance 
that a person will lie. The program 
has had to change its locus because 
ol these results. "We used to tell 
people to interview their partner to 
find out about their past. But now we 
tell them to get to know their partner 
first, form a bond with that person so 
Ihe risks are greatly reduced," said 



Morritz. 

IPFW has not had to directly deal 
with the questions its AIDS policy 
addresses. "These are guidelines," 
said Lanlz. The policy seems vague 
because there is very little known 
about AIDS, she said. "You have to 
work with the best information you 
have and get the best advise you 
can get. We learn new facts along 
the way," she said. 

Lantz said Ihe policy would be diffi- 
cult to enlorce because there is no 
way to know who is HIV positive. 
"We're not going to ask people to 
swear they don't have if," she said. 
"But it's like any other policy, we 
hope to educate people and that's 
Ihe best we can hope."

enough restraint as to give Ihe draw-

such a presence in com-

LeBlanc is taking steps to dispel this 
reputation. 

The exhibition conlinues through

THE COMMUNICATOR 



Campus Crusade strives to 'win, build, and send 1 at IPFW 



By Kpin E Beery 
Copy Editor 

With a strong emphasis on evange- 
lism, Campus Crusade lor Christ 
allempts to impact students' lives 
through fellowship. Bible studies and 
prayer. 

According to Lisa Ellis, a graduating 
senior in psychology and a leader in 
Campus Crusade, there are three 
points lo the organization's purpose: 
win, build and send. 

'The winning involves leading others 
to Christ," said Ellis, "which involves a 
saving knowledge of the Lord. We use 
a booklet called the 'Four Spiritual 
Laws' (a four-step process coming to 
know Jesus Christ as Savior). After 



we've won them over to the saving 
knowledge of Jesus Christ, we spend 
time in Bible studies, fellowship and 
prayer groups, building their knowledge 
ot the Lord. ..Once they've reached a 
point when they know a certain 
amount, wa send them out !o also 
reach others and build them. It's a 
continuous cycle, much like a wheel." 

Michael Frederick, a junior in supervi- 
sion and another leader of Campus 
Crusade, called the process the fulfill- 
ing of the great Commission. Accord- 
ing to Frederick, the Great Commission 
is 'everybody is going to be hearing 
about Jesus Christ and at least have 
an opportunity to hear and make a 
choice whether they want to accept him 



or reject him." 

Campus Crusade has many activities. 
Every Monday at noon in Kettler Hall 
Room 117 they have a meeting that 
can take on one of two alternating 
structures: a speaker along with 
music, announcements, skits and tesli- 
monies; or a prayer and praise meeting 
when people fellowship and pray. 
Campus Crusade also has Bible stud- 
ies, two for women and three for men 
al different limes during the week, and 
conferences throughtout the year with 
other college students in Indiana and 
surrounding slates. 

The organization has special events, 
too. They have a hayride planned for 
Nov. 9. a Christmas parly in December, 




and a trip to Daytona, Fla. in the spring. 
Special speakers are also invited to 
speak for Campus Crusade. Clark Kel- 
log, an ex-Indiana Pacers player, will 
be on campus Nov. 3 giving his testi- 
mony to athletes and anyone else inter- 
ested. He is a member of Athletes in 
Action, a ministry of Campus Crusade. 

Ellis was first introduced to Campus 
Crusade when she was a freshman 
and saw a flyer on a billboard. She 
went to the meeting but didn't know 
anyone, said Ellis, One of the seniors 
in the organization got her involved in a 
Bible sludy, and according to Ellis, 
That's what kept me going to Campus 
Crusade was the Bible study and the 
fellowship that came from thai." 

'It's developed a lot of my current per- 
lality,* Ellis continued. 'Before I v

really shy, really quiet. I didnl under- 
stand a lot ol the things I do now about 
Jesus. I'm much more confident, much 
bolder, and much belter able to cope 
with the chaotic world that we live in." 

Frederick's introduction to Campus 
Crusade had more ol a plot to it. "I 
was a freshman here on campus," said 
Frederick, "and I met a girl in one of my 
classes, and she told me about a free 
notetaking lecture that I could go to. I 
really wanted to do good in school, so I 
decided to go. I walked in and sat 
down, and Ihis guy comes in and intro- 
duces himsell and says, 'Welcome to 
College Ule (a ministry of Campus Cru- 
sade).' I thought, 'Wow, this is really 
weird, there's a name for this notetak- 
ing lecture." 

"I felt like it wasn't just a coincidence 



that I had been there," Frederick stat- 
ed. "In fact, the paper that I had the 
room written down on, I had the wrong 
room number that I walked in. .I went to 
a totaliy different place than what I had 
written down." 

How has Campus Crusade helped 
Frederick? "I think it (Campus Cru- 
sade) really offered me a different alter- 
native just having fun and hanging out 
with people and not having to use 
drugs to do ft." 

Frederick also stated that his sell- 
estem was low, but the meetings and 
(he knowledge gained in those meet- 
ings has helped his sell-esteem. He 
said. 'I felt like I could really help peo- 
ple oul instead of always receiving help 
Irom them."

IPFW soccer 

Kickers win, clinch fourth 



By Mark Donaldson 
Sports Editor 

A victory over Ihe University ot In- 
dianapolis on Saturday clinched a 
lourth-place finish tor the IPFW soccer 
team. 

Sophomore Neil Bogenschutz's two 
goals led the 'Dons to the 4-2 win. 
Bogenschulz, currently fourth on the 
Great Lakes Valley Conference scoring 
list wi!h 20 points, also tallied an assist. 
Two freshmen from West Lafayette, 
James Ewing and Kevin Green, also 
scored for IPFW. 

The top four GLVC teams play first- 
round playoff games on their home 
fields. IPFW will play host to Bel- 
larmine College on Wednesday, Oct. 
30, at 1 p.m. This will be Ihe first time 
that the Mastodons will host a confer- 
ence playoff game. IPFW defeated the 
Knights 3-2 in overtime on Sept. 21. 

Coach Troy Rushing looks for the lirst 
playoff game to be a close contest. 

'Against Bellarmine, the team that is 
on their game will win," he said. "Plus, 
when we played them the last time, 
they were playing without their sweep- 
Rushing also feels the team has 
recovered tram a midseason slump. 

There was about a five-game series 
when we weren't mentally into Ihe 



game," he said, "But I think we've got 
i! straightened out," 

Rushing also explained why goals by 
Bogenschulz against U of I, both on 
penalty shots, were his first since he 
scored two against St. Joseph's Col- 
lege on Sept. 25. 

*We moved Neil to center midfield 
because he had the ability to hold the 
ball," said Rushing. "It was part of our 
juggling the fine-up to get our speedier 
players upfront." 

On Sunday IPFW dropped an away 
game to Western Michigan University, 
2-0. in Kalamazoo. Western Michigan 
was the third Division I team the 
Mastodons have faced this season. 
IPFW fell to Valparaiso on Oct. 6 and 
to Eastern Michigan on Oct. 9. 

IPFW was awarded an additional win 
this week when GLVC member Lewis 
University was forced to forfeit its 
games for using an ineligible player. 

The Mastodons felt yesterday to take 
their 6-7-1 record, 3-3-1 in the GLVC, 
lo Lakeland, Florida to compete in the 
Juice Bowl Classic at Florida Southern 
Collage tomorrow and Saturday. 

IPFW will face Eckerd College, from 
St. Petersburg, tomorrow at 4 p.m. and 
meet Flordia Southern at 6:30 p.m. on 
Saturday.
