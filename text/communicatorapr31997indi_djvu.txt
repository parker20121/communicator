occurred at 8:20 p.m. on the fourth 
floor A student left a bag unattend- 
ed to return a few minutes later and 
find the bag and pcrsonaJ contents,

Professor researches in Mexico 



Once again. Alan K Sandstrom, 
professor of sociology and anthro- 
pology, will return to the Mexican 
village be has studied since 1970. 
Sandslrom slated thai he is looking 
forward to the year-long research be 
will conduct during 1997 and 1998 
on the Nahua Indians in the remote 
tropical forests of northern 
Veracruz. 

The American Council of 
Learned Societies selected 
Sandstrom for a fellowship which 
will match bis salary for one year 
The council is based in New York 
and is highly selective for fellow 
recipients 

"Ii was amazing that I got one." 
said Sandstrom. He will be on sab- 
batical from IPFW during that time. 
Sandstrom will be accompanied 
by bis wife, Pamela Effrein 
Sandsirom. and their son. Michael. 
Doth of ihem have aided in bis 
research in the past by providing 
rappon with villagers. 

"Bringing in my family made a 
big difference." said Alan. 

Pamela has also conducted 
research, particularly among Nahua 
women. In total, the Sandstroms 
have spent almost five years living 
in the vdlage of Amadan which is 
populated with 600 people 

According to Sandstrom. much 
has changed since he first came to 
Amatlan In 1970. the village was 
about 100 mdes from the nearest 
paved road. Because be had to walk 
this distance, there was no way to 
carry equipment, such as a lent, into 
the village. 

"1 lived in a comer of a school 
house for awhile," said Sandstrom. 
Later, he lived in a vil- 
lager's home. 

In 1972 to 1973. Sandslrom 



lived in Amatlan for 16 months 
while he completed his doctoral dis- 
sertation. During that time, he had to 
learn the language, NahuaU, and 
build rappon with the people. 

"At first they were wary. They 
were friendly, but guarded," said 
Sandsirom of ibeir response to him 
"It was almost a year before I was 
accepted." 

The Nahuas allowed Sandstrom 
to enter their kinship system which 
established a place for him in their 
society. 

Sandslrom was the first anthro- 
pologist to study the Nahuas, who 
had been sheltered from most out- 
siders. Sandstrom says that today, 
"every house has a light bulb." 

Electricity was introduced in 
1990 and now, about 80 percent of 
the people speak Spanish. Many 
younger Nahuas work in the cities 

Sandstrom's research in the next 
year will focus on the Nahua's agri- 
cultural system. The village lives on 
slash and bum horticulture. A sec- 
tion of forest is burned to allow vil- 
lagers to plant and harvest crops, but 
is left to regrow after a couple years 
of farming. In 1992, Ihe Mexican 
government eliminated protective 
laws for Indian agriculture 
Sandstrom plans to study the effects 
this bas bad on the Nahuas. 

Over the years, Sandstrom bas 
published numerous research arti- 
cles on Nahua culture and bas writ- 
ten two books: "Traditional Paper 
making and Paper Cult Figures of 
Mexico" and "Com is Our Blood: 
Culture and Ethnic Identity in a 
Contemporary Aztec Indian 
Village." 

He is also editor of "Nahua 
Newsletter," a joint publication of 
the IPFW Anthropology Program 
and the Center for Lantin American 
and Caribbean Studies at Indiana 
University in Bloomington. 



aware that there are thieves and ihefl 
does happen. 

The thefts in March arc not an 
big concern. In February, two inci- 
dents of theft did occur on consecu- 
tive days near the end of the month. 

On February 25. a Tuesday, a 
purse was taken from ihe fourth 
floor of the library around mid- 
afternoon. 

On the following day, another 
purse was taken from the same floor 
in the early evening. 



At this point, Lauren Denhartog, 
IPFW chief of police and safety, 
emphasized that leaving items unat- 
tended is, unfortunately, not safe. 

"We do patrol [the library] four 
to eight times a day." said Haner 
"But with limited personnel, we 
can't focus on one building. We 
make our presence known, bul they 
[thieves] wail until we're gone." 

A victim of one of ihe thefts 
occurring in March said she is 
extremely paranoid after this inci- 



dent. She bad all of ber personal 
belongings taken: credit cards, cel- 
lular phone, glasses, appointment 
and scheduling books, textbooks. 
cash, hanking records and checks, 
among other things. 

Being an international student, 
this has been very difficult for her to 
deal with as her family and comfort 
are far away 

"I just bad surgery on my knee 
and walked with a cane, so I bad to 
gel a ride to school that day. That is 




Junior Reynold Joseph, an engineering major, keeps his bag close al hand as he studies on the fourth 
floor ol Ihe Helmke Library. Notice thai Ihe sign behind him says, 'Thefts occur everywhere." 



why I had all of my things with me," 
said the victim. She wished to have 
her name withheld. 

She said the campus police 
made her walk over to their office in 
the night to report the losses, mak- 
ing the whole situation worse. 

"This person knows everything 
about me now. where 1 am supposed 
to be. where I live 1 pbone two peo- 
ple now every night before I go to 
bed," said the victim. "I am so para- 
noid." 

Reiterating the advice of cam- 
pus policemen, Virginia Willig, 
assistant manager of Helmke 
Library's service desk, said students 
need to be aware of their personal 
belongings at all limes. 

"I'd like to see students hired by 
security to blend in with other stu- 
dents and watch for [theft)," said 
Willig "Maybe they could even 
leave out book bags with bar codes 
in them to set off the alarm when 
[thieves] leave." 

Wilhg sees a lot of transients 
come m and loiter And because 
Helmke is a public library, she gets 
concerned about those who come in 
without paper, pencils or book bags. 

Willig mentioned the lockers in 
Walb Union and the Helmke Lounge 
as a place for students to keep their 
possessions safe. She hopes promot- 
ing the use of tbese will lessen the 
crimes 

Students can get lockers by 
placing a quarter in the locker A key 
is located inside. Anyone can use the 
lockers throughout the day. 

At this point there are no wit- 
nesses to the crimes. Follow-ups are 
under way in Ihe cases of ihe two 
suspects. 

Denhartog asks that anyone 
with information on these inves- 
tigations contact campus police 
at 481-6827. 



FAST loses speed: Program will end in May 



Recendy, IPFW made the deci- 
sion to terminate the Future 
Academic Scholars Track program 
(FAST). This program was devel- 
oped and designed to help African 
American, Hispanic and at-risk chil- 
dren get ready for higher educa- 
tion.Tne program helped children 
from the sixth grade to high school; 
its basic function was to promote 
and encourage disadvantaged and 
minority students to attend college. 

The proponents of FAST 
believe the program started at a time 
when young adults need access to 
educational facilities to improve 
their lives and their future. 

Since their enrollment in US 
colleges and universities has tapered 
off drastically, the program focused 
on providing disadvantaged youth 
with the life skills needed to suc- 
ceed. It gave them alternatives and 
vital persona] skills that could help 
ihem rise above being anoiher siatis- 



fhe program was developed by 
Bettyc J. Poignard, who was the 
director of Multicultural Services. 
Currently, she is with ihe Fori 
Wayne Chamber of Commerce. 

"The program was designed to 
increase ihe pool of African- 
American and Hispanic students." 
said Poignard "It served the pur- 
pose it was set up for." 

"There are letters from parents 
who evaluated the program exter- 
nally and a comprehensive evalua- 
tion done by (he Eli Lilly 
Endowment Foundation," said 
Poignard "The success rate is Ihere; 
I don't know why they would cancel 
the program ." 

Hernando Estevez, adviser and 
coordinator for FAST, has some 
insight as lo why the program is no 
longer available. 

"Only one proposal per institu- 
tion will be given to the generous 
foundations for their acceptance and 
FAST is not going to be one of 
them," said Estevez. 



"The primary grant came from 
ihe Focllinger Foundation and with 
them changing their criteria for 
funding' we could not ask them for a 
gram for that 
program when 
there are others 
thai need it 
more," said 
Frank Borelli, 
vice chancellor 
of studeni 
affairs. "I am 
not able to say 
what proposal 
was submitted 
because we have 
so many." 

"There is no 
lack of commit- 
ment from me or anyone else here. I 
believe in the program itself and I'm 
here for the 90 kids wbo I help." 
said Estevez. 

According to Esievez, between 
the years 1987 to 1996 there was a 
87 perceni success rale. 

" The funding is not there 




Hernando 
Estevez 



because the University feels it does- 
n't benefit direcdy and education as 
a whole is noi their mam concern." 
said Estevez. 

"Some of ihe chUdren who fin- 
ish the FAST program enroll in this 
university and so do some of their 
parents, " said Esievez. "How can 
that not be financially advanta- 



Foundation awarded $25,000 to 
the program. Funding was also 
provided by private industries as 
well: Slater Steel, for example. 

According to Estevez. the 
money is there but is just going 
lo be used for something that 
will benefit the school directly. 

The FAST program served as 
a bridge to help students under- 
stand lhat college is possible, 
and what is required academi- 
cally and financially to get 
there 

Marcia Tapp Sanders, direc- 
tor of the FAST program, was 
unavailable for comment.

Food bank serves city 



by Sbelfey Porter 
SUfT Writer 

The Community Harvest Food 
Bank in Fort Wayne is home to the 
669th Presidential Point of Light 
award. Presented in 1992, the award 
marked a real milestone for 
Community Harvest from its "tail- 
gate" operation beginning out of the 
Lincoln National warehouse in 
1983. The food bank moved into a 
city warehouse on Lafayette Street 
in 1984 and in thai year alone donat- 
ed 200,000 pounds of food. A 
decade later, Community Harvest 
donated more than 8 million pounds 
of food a year. 

Community Harvest is not a 
government agency. The new build- 
ing was funded entirely by dona- 
tions and the food bank operates on 
2,500 to 3,000 volunteer hours each 
month. A small, management staff is 
paid out of the annual operating 
budget which is raised each year by 
donations and fundraisers. The food 
bank does receive one government 
grant each year and distributes gov- 
ernment commodities for 
Community Action of Native 
Indiana (CANI). 

Community Harvest helps to 
feed approximately 60,000 people 
each month through 480-plus agen- 
cies in nine counties throughout 
northeastern Indiana. The food bank 
also provides "non-food" items such 
as paper goods, soap and personal 
care items. All food and non-food 
items are donated to the food bank 
from a list of over 300 donors. 
Donations come from grocery stores 
and food distribution centers such as 



Super- Valu and Nestle's. from man- 
ufacturers such as Edy's Ice Cream, 
from local restaurants and from 
reclamation centers. 

Reclamation centers process 
food and paper goods that are not 
sellable because the packaging has 
been damaged in some way. A can 
may be dented or a box of dispos- 
able diapers may be crushed, for 
example. The food bank has an area 
in the warehouse devoted to sorting 
through reclaimed items and sal- 
vaging what can be used. 
Manufacturers may donate items 
that are mislabeled or mistakes. 
According to Susan Stewart, donor 
relations coordinator for the food 
bank. Community Harvest cele- 
brates holidays one season later, 
thanks to distributor donations of 
leftover seasonal treats, such as 
cookies and candy. 

Approved charity agencies may 
walk through the warehouse and 
"shop" the reclaimed bins for any- 
thing they choose. They are also 
given a "menu." that may change 
daily, of items currently available 
from which tbey can place their reg- 
ular order Doth reclaimed and 
donated items are weighed and 
tracked when they leave the food 
bank in case of recalls. The agencies 
pay 14 cents per pound for their gro- 
ceries. This money helps to fund the 
operating budget of the food bank. 
Community Harvest is pan of a 
nationwide network of food banks, 
called Second Harvest and operates 
according to their guidelines. An 
agency must prove not-for-profit 
status to be approved to purchase 
goods from (he food bank and the 



agency must also sign a food bank 
agreement that the 14 cents per 
pound cost of the goods will not be 
passed onto recipients. Agencies 
must also follow safe food handling 
practices and the food bank makes 
visits to ensure the agencies are in 
compliance with these guidelines. 

Community Harvest also oper- 
ates an emergency food pantry, 
located in the front of the building 
and staffed entirely by volunteers, 
which gives bags of food for free to 
persons in need. The emergency 
pantry is open to anyone willing to 
show picture identification and a 
social security number. 

"The pantry is most 
visited by mostly the 
'working poor'" said 
Stewart. "These are 
the two and three 
income fam- J 

ilies strug' 
gling to; 
make end; 
meet. Some 
of these 
families 
have (o make 
a decision to 
buy 'beat or eat' and the 
pantry really helps them out." 

Community Harvest sees few 
repeat families at the emergency 
pantry. The food bank will try to 
refer people who come to a pantry in 
their geographical area. 

In 1991, Community Harvest 
was featured on CNN for its 
SeniorPak program, which is staffed 
almost exclusively by volunteers. A 
brown paper bag, decorated by 
school children, of food and toi- 




letries is delivered to seniors every 
two weeks. Community Harvest's 
newest program is Kids Cafe, which 
is an after-school feeding program 
in three locations throughout Fort 
Wayne. Leftover food from restau- 
rants and catering is funneled to on- 
sight feeding agencies such as res- 
cue missions and shelters through 
the "Second Helping" program. 
Additionally, the food bank has lots 
of smaller programs, such as the 
"Growing Groceries" gardening 
project which aims to promote self- 
sufficiency, nutrition workshops and 
a gleaning program in which vol- 
unteers glean harvested 
fields, 
ommunity 
Harvest has 
also helped 
th disaster 
lief through the 
American Red 
Cross.

IPFW Walb Memorial Ballroom, 
come to "The Royal Order of Our 
Lady of the Blush Brush and 
Friends" to benefit ATDS research. 

This event is put on by United 
Sexualities (US) and Miss Gay Fort 
Wayne. The proceeds will be divid- 
ed between US and the Community 
AIDS Action Team (CAAT). The 
money made from this benefit will 



be used for AIDS education and 
prevention. 

According to Brian Tepper, 
administrative vice president of US, 
they are expecting about 100 peo- 
ple. At last semester's benefit there 
were around 78 people. There will 
be over 16 performers. Some will 
be female and male impersonators 
lip synching to various songs and 
live singers will also be performing. 

Advance tickets cost 55 and $7 
at the door. Tickets are available 
through US. Hi-tech Hair Design, 
CAAT, Up the Stairs Community 



Center and After Dark. Cash dona- 
tions will be accepted. 

A table will be set up that 
evening if people wouldjust like to 
drop off donations. 

"Any amount will help tremen- 
dously with the prevention and edu- 
cation of ATDS," said Tepper. 

This event is going to be done 
three times a year. Once during the 
fall and spring semesters and then 
once during the summer. It will 
offer the same type of entertain- 
ment each time and all proceeds 
will benefit US and CAAT. 



"This event should prove to be 
very entertaining and a lively 
evening," saidTepper.

'STAR bV DIALS INTO SUCCESS 



by Jeremy Ecenbargcr 
Editor 

"Ii's worked for tbem. so il will 
work for us " 

This popular saying may just 
be what STAR 69 has going for 
them Currenlly, several bands, 
such as No Doubt and The Fugees, 
have become quite popular With 
their all-male bands and their 
female lead vocalist, these two 
bands have reached [he lop of the 
charts Hopefully, with a little luck, 
STAR 69, consisting of a three- 
male band and a female vocalist, 
can follow their success. 

Throbbing guitars and evoca- 
tive lyrics fill their debui album, 
"Eabng February." on Radioactive 
Records While some songs lack a 
certain strength from the lead 
vocalist, lulie Daniels, in general, 
they hit a nice groove. 

"Eating February" starts off 
with ibe strong "You are Here," a 
song thai sets the mood for the 
entire album The beat is hypnotiz- 
ing and surely stands on its own. 

The album then moves into 
unsettling territory with tracks such 
as "I'm Insane," "Burning Down 
the House," "Rotten Punch," and 
"Scabs " While their songs may not 
yet be top rate, listeners will enjoy 
most of the "tough girl" lyrics. 



However, as said before, the vocal- 
ist just seems to be holding some- 
thing back. 

STAR 69 formed in London 
two years ago where Los Angeles 
native Daniels was discovering her 
passion for song writing. With no 
musical experience to draw from, 
she picked up an acoustic guitar 
and tapped into her emotions. 

"Song writing is therapy," says 
Daniels, while remaining elusive 
about the lyrical content of her 
songs "I know the thoughts that 
ran through my mind when I wrote 
these songs, but other people can 
make their own connections " 

Daniels later hooked up with 
guitarist Richard Corden. bassist 
Warren Huan and original drum- 
mer Patch Hannon, since replaced 
by lobnny Haro. 

In 1995. STAR 69 released two 
independent singles. "Mama Don't 
Let" and "You are Here," which, 
along with a series of live gigs, 
were met with critical acclaim in 
the U.K and gained attention by 
several major labels 

Their music is tough, yet some- 
how easy on the ear fans of alter- 
native music are sure to enjoy their 
awkward way of expressing the 
joys and tribulations of relation- 
ships today.

Chidtian wUifitgum meaning, to mutk 



Are you getting tired of listening to the same 
meaningless songs being played on the radio? 

If you want to fill your heart with new and 
motivating music, then a healthy change may be 
just what the doctor ordered. 

Contemporary Christian singer and song- 
writer David Kauffinan will be in concert tomor- 
row at 7:30 pm. in Neff Recital Hall. 

Kauffman is a guitar and piano player who 
bases his music on religious principles about 
ordinary circums lances we all face. He writes 
about the journey of life, including walking in 



faith, even when we are faced 
dark moments What 
makes the difference in 
his music is that he 
injects a way of living 
that makes sense, making 
life better 

Kauffman has record- 
ed three CDs to date and each one 
reflects a different character He has 
recorded such titles as "Write Cm My 
Heart," "Wear Your Inside Out" and 
"One of a Kind." His music has been 
featured in the movie "Dead Man 
Walking." 



■My songs are based on religious principles." 
said Kauffman. "Each song is like an 
offering of a new and different way 
to approach life. I hope that peo- 
ple consider it, because living 
out of faith is the best way I 
know how to live." 

At the concert, Kauffman will 
be sending bis message in an exclusive preview 
of his musical program His evening concert 
is free to IPFW students and $2 general 
admission. A group of 10 or more can get in 
the door for $15. 

This event is sponsored by Students 
Activities Board and Campus Ministries.

I was angry at God, the truck that hit you 

And even at you 

You weren't supposed to die

You were the person I could always coul on 

But like a candle in the wind 
You were gone, never to be seen from again 

I know deep in my heart 

You're up in Heaven,

For many students, the cost of a 
college education can be unbear- 
able. This is due to all (he fees that 
are assessed to the increasingly high 
tuition. Many students tend to do 
poorer in school than they could be 
doing, if they did not have this extra 
weight on their shoulders. We all 
know the importance of the educa- 
tion that we are seeking and hope 
that there is some way that we can 
lighten our financial load. Many stu- 
dents use loans that they will have to 



THE F(l 



pay back after they graduate Others 
receive grants and there arc some 
who are awarded scholarships. 
These are all ways of lightening 
the load. 

Recently, six students found out 
what it is like to receive an award 
for excelling. During this year's 
National Engineer's Week, these 
students received an $800 scholar- 
ship from the Northeast Indiana 
National Engineer's Week 
Committee. The scholarships were 
given out at the Feb. 22 banquet 
held on campus. 

The six recipients are Chris 



Moran, Larry Ley Jr., Saad Mian 
and Michael Klebcr. all of Fort 
Wayne. Chris Hawbakcr of Decatur 
and Keith Evans of Grabil These 
gendemen should be congratulated 
on a job well done. They have 
shown what it lakes to excel in the 
business world. 

Moran is a junior who is Study- 
ing electrical engineering. He is one 
of three electrical engineering 
majors to receive the scholarship 
this year. 

Other electrical engineering stu- 
dents are junior Evans and senior 
Mian. Kleber and Hawbaker are 



both junior electrical engineer- 
ing technology majors and Ley 
is a sophomore electrical engi- 
neering major. 

Ley was awarded a $1,000 
scholarship from the Indiana 
Electronics Manufacturers 
Association (1RMA) during 
the banquet. 

The IRMA scholarship program 
is a program that helps support 
Indiana student residents The recip- 
ients have to be involved in an elec- 
tronics education program. This is 
done to encourage these students to 
pursue a career in Indiana.

Top 

officials 

hypocritical 

toward 

students 



To the editor 

Last semester I read an article 
in Tbc Communicator about a stu- 
dent who was awarded $10,000 for 
simply claiming racist treatment 
from an 1PFW professor. According 
to me anicle, tbc student's claims 
bad no concrete substantiation and 
in some instances were contradict- 
ed by other students who had wit- 
nessed the alleged actions. 1 would 
like to know what made IPFW feel 
that this was the 510.000 situation? 

The answer to this question 
could explain why claims that I 
have made about a professor were 
ignored. Unlike the $10,000 claim, 
I had letters from witnesses that 
gave my claim credibility. 1 made 
my complaint to the Dean of 
Students and the Chancellor's 
office. However, no corrective 
action beyond a phone call to a 
depanment bead to ask '"Did it hap- 
pen?" has ever been taken on my 
behalf What is this $10,000 secret 1 

I look philosophy at this 
University and received what I and 
other students in the class consid- 
ered to be unfair treatment from a 
professor. I had signed letters from 
my fellow students that described 
this particular proressor's discrimi- 
natory and unprofessional actions 
towards me I undoubtedly was 
publicly harassed for my race, gen- 
der and religious beliefs. Surely the 
way that 1 was treated demanded 
some corrective action Maybe. 
SlO.OOO? 

On one band, we seem to have 
a minority student who makes 
unsubstantiated claims against a 
non-tenured professor and gets 
noibing. Docs this sound like equal 
treatment for all students? 

In my case. 1 did not seek 
money. 1 sought a fair grade. 
However, 1 guess that it is easier for 
the University to blow $10,000 of 
our money and fire a non-tenured 
professor, than it is to make a 
tenured professor, that is obviously 
wrong, grade and treat students in a 
ethical and professional manner 

It seems to me that this 
University could care less about 
true justice or equality for all stu- 
dents and that it only cares about 
covering its political ass.

Poor politicking or poor 
student involvement? 



"Candidates should be representing the interests of 
the student body, but when there is a lack of partici- 
pation on behalf of the students, how can we expect 
the candidates to know what is important to us? 



w 



ith the student elec- 
tions now at an end. 
many students com- 
plained that they were not 
informed enough about the can- 
didates to make an intelligent 
choice. This is obvious since 
only 678 students voted out of 
over 10,000 students on cam- 
pus. Why is this? 

The answer could lie with 
the poor politicking of the can- 
didates. Although there were 
more flyers and posters adver- 
tising this year's election, as 
opposed to last year's, there was 
a definite lack of candidate-to- 
student contact, not to mention 
the vague and seemingly unim- 
portant platforms that the candi- 
dates ran on. 

The issues were mostly 
petty ones, for example making 
the computers more accessible. 
Sure, this is an issue that should 
be addressed — but is it so 
important that it should be the 
platform for those running? The 
candidates seemed to think so. 

Most matters stem from 
financing, and so candidates 
should have been reevaluating 
the disbursement of allocations 
which stems from our top 
school officials While there is 
nothing wrong with being 
fond of sports, we need to 
remember that the main pur- 
pose of this institution is to 
educate. 

It is nothing new that 60 
percent of our money goes 
toward athletics while the 
remaining 40 percent goes 
toward all remaining student 



organizations. 

We need a leader who will 
put pressure on the top adminis- 
trators who control the money. 
However, the candidates are not 
solely responsible for their poor 
politicking 

Candidates should be repre- 
senting the interests of the stu- 
dent body, but when there is a 
lack of participation on behalf 
of the students, how can we 
expect the candidates to know 
what is important to us? 

Granted, this is a com- 
muter campus and we do not 
have the funds that the "big 
universities" do to run more 
sophisticated campaigns, but 
that is no excuse for the lack 
of student involvement. 

Students need to realize that 
they are electing those who will 
govern the policies thai will 
affect their time here on cam- 
pus. Since time on campus is 
usually limited because this is a 
commuter campus, most stu- 
dents fail to get involved with 
school issues. From this view- 
point it is understandable that 
students are disinterested in the 
school's politics. 

However, students run the 
risk of underestimating the 
potential power that they have 
to change the running of the 
school when they do not partic- 
ipate or show interest in what 
happens on campus. 

If this lack of student 
involvement continues, this 
year's weak election should be 
viewed as an example of what is 
to come in the future years. 



Letter 



Capitalism 
is a joke 



To the editor: 

What if everything is a lie? 
What if accepted truth began as a 
rumor? We assume a history book 
is fact and not a work of fiction. But 
who really knows? How many of us 
witnessed the events depicted upon 
the pages of our textbooks? So how 
can we logically dispute what we 
are being taught? 

Simply stated, you either 
accepl it all or reject everything 
and attempt io locale the pearl of 
[tuth Reject capitalism, reject 
college and reject the three 
branches of bureaucracy that dine 
upon our labor. 

With this in mind lei's lake a 
closer look at everything, it's really 
all quite simple once the veil of 
innocence is removed from the face 
of the United States. You come io 
the realization that we're all slaves 
to materialism and this nightmare 
called the "American Dream." 

Politics or propaganda, where 
do I begin? They both gel life from 
the same source so in my mind (hey 
are interchangeable. Democrat or 
Republican, it doesn't matter which 
party you identify with because 
every politician is a muppct And 
corporate America controls the 
strings with the precision of the late 
Jim Henson, but should we be sur- 
prised? Isn'i this what capitalism is 
all about? Distribution of wealth in 
this country is a joke. Half of one 
percent of the population has an 
iron grip on 85 percent of this coun- 
try's wealth. It's smoke and 
mirrors, trickle down economics 
sends your paycheck io Bill Gates 
So we struggle to survive and com- 
pete against each other fighting 
over a plaie of crumbs. 

Power io the people! Or should 
we kneel lo the wealthy? Is the 
United States still a republic? If you 
have money in this country die sys- 
tem is a pretzel designed to serve 
you. .Bui if you're not an aristocrat, 
you'd better nol step out of line, for 
the judicial system of this country 
has no mercy upon the individual 
who doesn't feed the system Take a 
drive through die heart of a major 
American city. What do you see? 
Or does Ihe truth of capitalism scare 
you? What has happened to the 
middle class? What does minimum 
wage say about Ihe United Slates? 
Two class polarization makes you 
either rich or poor. 

How do we remedy this situa- 
tion? Maybe if politicians actually 
cared, equality might have the 
chance to exist. What is college? 
We attend college lo assimilate, 
swallow ihe bitter pill of greed. 
Capitalism is perfect. The United 
Stales is the best. Would you like to 
travel to the moon? Jusi follow the 
ladder of lies thai ihe propaganda 
machine has built for our pleasure. 

Tum on the television or go 
see the latest flick — let them 
occupy your mind while Uncle 
Sam sneaks in the backdoor and 
steals your soul. 

Does the Constitution still 
exist? Whal exactly was the 
Declaration of Independence? 
What has become of the Bill of 
Rights? Is capitalism die best cre- 
ation of the human mind? Many 
claim il is bui how can it be when il 
puis money as the sole purpose of 
human existence. Is something bro- 
ken here? Are we willing lo 
change? Something has to hap- 
pen because lies don't float and 
when they sink only the truth 
shall remain.

w i ib 
Earth Day fasl 
approaching 
us, which 
lakes place on 
April 22nd, I 
jusl want lo 
remind every- 
one to Please 
Recycle! 

Sure, 

Earth Day may seem like one of 
those Hallmark-created holidays 
thai boosi card sales, but it's real- 
ly a day set aside 10 celebrate Ihe 
planet we call home. It is also a 
day that reminds us of Earth's 
vulnerability. 

I know (hat the fires thai fueled 
the recycling craze have died down 
somewhat, but that does not mean 
that the problem has disappeared. 

I first became interested in 
recycling in middle school when 1 
realized that the plastic juice bottles 
that I bad daily at lunch were basi- 
cally a waste 1 threw one away 
everyday which amounted lo five 
per week! 1 also knew ihat those 
bottles were not biodegradable 
and were not going anywhere 
very soon. 

I explained my concerns lo a 
friend and fellow juice boltlc con- 
noisseur and her reply was, "Well, 
they are recyclable" My response 
was, "Do you recycle yours?" and 
she said "No" The whole purpose 
or them being recyclable was 
defeaied by her choice not lo recy- 
cle I have never bought or con- 
sumed another one of those plastic 
juice bottles. 



Man is an interesting creature- 
He takes and takes from the envi- 
ronment, but all he gives back is 
virtually indestructible clutter to 
remind the world of bus presence, 

Humans have inhabited the 
earth for 
thousands of 

years, but »•-« 

until recent- 
ly, relics left 
by man have 
either 
remained as 
beautiful 
artifacts and 
architectural 
feats or natu- 
rally become 
pari of earth 
from which 
they came.

Don't get

This is noi a technological advance 
It is used in almost every house-

anything labeled "disposable." 



I'm sorry, but I refuse to throw 
away anything thai will not decom- 
pose for many lifetimes 

Let's take plastic pop bottles for 

example. While we're at it, let's take 

the 20-ounce "Quick Slams" that

tain food. Saran 
wrap and paper 
plates (that were frequently used 
by ihe previous food service com- 
pany) can work wonders and are 
somewhat less offensive to the 
environment. 

This campus must be com- 



mended for offering paper and alu- 
minum recycling. Actually, thanks 
should really be extended to the 
Biology club for taking action and 
providing the bins. Too bad these 
routes of re-use are not used by 
everyone, everytime. 

I feel that if the campus pro- 
vides 20-ouncc, plastic "time cap- 
sules," then a plastic recycling bin 
should be implemented. Where do 
our academic fees go again? 

1 want more recycling to bap- 
pen on campus. I want you lo 
mink about every item that you 
throw away. 

I also warn you to think about 
how items are packaged. Buy items 
which have little or no packaging 
and arc easily recyclable. 

Buy a can of pop instead of a 
bottle At least you know what io do 
with the can when you're through 
There are friendly, blue, aluminum 
recycling barrels in every building 
on campus 

Our society has been taught 
that anything labeled disposable -- 
is - bul that is not true Ideally, a 
disposable item is one that cannot 
be reused or recycled and is 
biodegradable If that is the case, 
there are not too many things thai 
are truly disposable 

Yes. it is true thai the past 
century has been one of 
unprecedented technological 
advance, and afler we are all 
long gone, we'll have lots and 
lots and lots to show for il that 
our children's children will 
have to deal with.

Guest Column: George GounarLs 



IPSGA's president bids farewell to student body 




make sure that before I go, that I 
give thanks again to the students 
who pui me in office last year. 
for believing in me and my fel- 
low executives. 

On that note, I want to also per- 
sonally say thank you lo my fellow 
executives. Senaie and Student 
Activities Board (SAB) members 
Without them and all their hard 
work a lot of our achievements this 
year would not have been possible 
Lei me lake a moment lo recap a 
small portion of those achieve- 
ments for you. 

1PFW was recognized as the 
first Rock the Vote Campus in the 
state of Indiana above all olhcr 
campuses including our main cam- 
puses. IPSGA successfully spon- 
sored its first off-Broadway perfor- 
mance in the schools theater. The 
Senaie sponsored a celebration of 
campus and community and the 



SAB ran a coffee house series and 
a children's carnival for the chil- 
dren of IPFW students, and ihe lisi 
goes on and on These are just a 
few examples of what has been 
done ihLs year. 

Some things that are not yei 
seen bul are coming to campus due 
to the efforts of Lhis years IPSGA 
will be 24-bour computer access in 
the libraries, a 24-hour lounge area, 
a legal counseling service for stu- 
dents and a studenl information 
radio station thai will broadcast lo 
all (he different activities that are 



taking place on the campus 

Like I said before, il has been a 
great ride. Of course, as with any 
changing of the guard, it is time to 
welcome the new reign holders for 
next year. Il is my hope that they 
loo will continue to take IPSGA to 
even newer and greater beighls, 
constantly finding new ways to 
improve the campus services avail- 
able for the students. 

Congratulations lo all of you! 
As for myself. I may noi have run 
for President of our student body 
again lhis year, but that doesn't 



mean thai I am just going io disap- 
pear. I will still be out there and 
youjust might be surprised where I 
pop up at next

Sixteen- year-old Martina 
Hingis, the latest teen female sensa- 
tion to grace the sporting world, 
spanked former teen pbenom. 



Monica Seles, in last 
week's Lipion tennis 
championship. 

Unfortunately for 
Hingis, her reign as the 
top female tennis player 
will not last long This is 
not a condemnation of 
women's tennis, but more 
of a condemnation of all 
women's sports that force 
pre-pubescent girls to the 
rigors of world class 
physical competition 
Hingis is follow- 
ing in the footsteps of Jennifer 
Capriati, who just checked inio 
rehab again She took the tennis 
world by storm and now she's jusi a 



footnote to most tournaments How 
long will ii lake Hingis to be loppled 
from the mountain top? Will she be 
beat by the next child siar or will 
she beat herself? Will the pressure 
destroy her? 

Why do we demand so much 
from our teenage girls? Why do we 
put so much pressure on tbem to 
succeed at a time when most of 
them haven l even learned bow to 
drive? Been on their firsi date? 
Kissed a boy? Had iheir first peri- 
od? 

We expect them to act like cute, 
little cookie-cutter images of Ihe last 
leen pbenom. but when they begin 
lo grow up they start lo realize what 
Ihey missed And Ihen we are horri- 



fied by their reaction to years of 
dedication They believed what 
iheir elders told them Then they 
recognized bow they were being 
exploited by the same elders they 
trusted and they rebelled with a 
fury. 

The same ibing happens wiib 
Olympic gym nans ts Remember 
Kerri Strug, the diminutive tumbler 
with the voice of Alvin ihe 
Chipmunk, who captured America's 
collective heart. She was cute and 
everyone loved her, but did anyone 
think about the stress this little girl 
went through. How she fought off 
puberty and the naiural changes her 
body would go through just lo be 
ihe best gymnast. The binging and 



purging, the malnutrition. We are 
pathetic thai we tacitly demand thai 
of our youlh 

It's sad the world forces women 
(o deny themselves and the natural 
changes their bodies go through just 
lo get that perfect score Tbc seem- 
ingly harmless sport (if you want lo 
call ii lhai) of Figure Skating also 
forces women to deny their bodies 
for the sake of a triple or quadruple 
axle or some other twisting and 
turning movement a mature body 
would noi allow them to do. 

Recently, some waif of a skater 
is burning up the ice to become ihe 
first female to complete a quadruple 
something or other. Tara Lipmski, 
14. is racing against her body Once 



she starts to develop, her figure will 
not allow her to twist like before. 
She will be pigeonholed into the 
same slot as Michelle Kwan. a for- 
mer teen skating sensation who is a 
"has-been" at 16 How would you 
feel if your career is over before 
your pimples had cleared up? 

As a species (human), we seri- 
ously need to delve into what we 
expeel of our women athletes. Do 
we want ihem more than human? 
Do we warn ihem lo deny the natur- 
al changes of puberty? Or can we 
accept that women athletes do not 
need to starve themselves to be per- 
fect? Can we slop idolizing the 
stunted gymnasts who vault with a 
twisted ankle?

Softball team struggles 
with season transition 



by Scott Warden 
Sports Editor 

IPFW's softbalt team might be 
struggling, but first-year coach Die 
Doumaman isn't about to take the 
easy way out and simply call ibis 
season a rebuilding year. Bui look- 
ing at Mi., facts, ii would be hard not 
10. 

With a record of 3-20, it's easy 
to sec that the 'Dons are going 
through a rough patch in the pro- 
gram's history, but wiib a new head 
coach and having 
only Ihree players 
reluming from 
last-year's squad, 
it isn't inapprnpn- 
ale lo call ibis a 
learn in transition 

On a team of 
13 players, 10 are 
new lo the pro- 
gram, including 
eight freshmen 
Not only is the 
learn in a state of 
transition, bui so 
are the individuals 
who are fresh oui 
of high school. 

According to 

Doumaman, the 

key problem for the team has been 
ihe lack of offensive production 

"We're simply not a good hil- 
ling team yet," said Doumanian. 
"It's a big adjustmeni coming from 
playing high school ball to playing 
ai the college level They're obvi- 
ously seeing a lot better pitching 
than Ihey are used to going up 
against. Thai, more than anything, is 
our No 1 weakness 

Wuh the offense struggling lo 
score runs, ihe defense has been 
forced to pick up its play and, 
according id Doumanian, has risen 
lo Ihe challenge. 

"We have been doing a really 
good job in the field as of late," 
Doumanian said. "We haven't hurt 
ourselves much ai all defensively 
We started out slow m the field, 



"We just have got 

to keep working 

and believing in 

ourselves and 

believing that we 

are going to win," said 

Doumanian. "We just 

can't give up. and so tar I 

haven't seen any signs ot 

quitting." 

— Doumanian 



especially during our spring break 
trip lo Florida, but since then we've 
worked on that a little bil more I 
think thai everybody is feeling a lot 
more comfortable out ihere." 

The team's record, said 
Doumaman, might be an accurate 
tool lo evaluate bis team. 

"We just seem lo be a little 
snake-biticn." said Doumanian 
"We're not losing games - we're 
gelling beat We have played a num- 
ber of really close games, including 
two this past weekend that we lost in 

, _ . Ihe final inning of 

the game We are 
not beating our- 
selves, we're sim- 
ply gelling beat, 
which is one posi- 
tive aspect " 
With such a 
young squad, the 
'Dons are strug- 
gling to find team 
leaders who can 
not only lake 
charge of the game 
physically, but 
who can lead ihe 
team emotionally 
as well. 

"We only have 
— Iwo seniors and 
two juniors," said Doumanian, "but 
both of our juniors are new to the 
program, having transferred from 
oiher colleges. (Leadership) is one 
of the things that we need to see 
more of if we want lo be successful. 
I'd like to see someone siep up and 
fill Ihat position on this team. You 
don't have to be a senior to be a 
leader. 

"They do a really good job 
as a team of supporting each other, 
but we don't have one person who 
can step up and take charge when 
something is happening out on the 
field." 

Three freshmen have emerged 
as key players on the team. Tiffany 
Allomong is among the leading bit- 
ters on Ihe team and, according to 
Doumaman. is shining at ihe short- 




Melissa Ashbaugh practices her swing during a practice earlier this 
week. The Softball team still tnes hard in spite ot their losses 



signs of quilling." 

Wiih the talented freshmen 
gaining more experience every 
game at ihe eollege level, Ibis team 
is rebuilding, bul Doumanian is con- 
tinuing lo focus on this season, and 
not what lies in ihe future 

"You really can't look ahead." 
said Doumanian. "but if everyone 
does stick around and keeps work- 
ing hard like they have been doing 
all season, I think thai we have a 
good chance in Ihe near future to 
be among Ihe top teams in our 
conference " 



Freiburger have also been major 
contributors to the team Together, 
said Doumanian. the three freshmen 
are probably the team's top players 
at this point in Ihe season. 

Doumanian believes thai even 
with the lack of success the team has 
shown this season, everyone has 
remained positive throughout the 
year. 

"We jusl have got to keep work- 
ing and believing in ourselves and 
believing that we are going to win," 
said Doumanian. "We just can't give 
up, and so far 1 haven't seen any

Apnl and frost still covers ihe 
ground in the morning. 

Summer is officially here, no 
mailer what the calendar tells you. 

I came lo ibis conclusion on the 
cold and damp first hole at Pond-A- 
RiverGolf Club, a personal favorite 
course on ibe outskirts of 
Woodbum. 1 knew that summer was 
upon us as 1 walked up to the first 
tee and took the first practice 
swings of the fresh season. 

Golf season has begun. 

I'm really not a golfer. I golf — 
not well - but 1 shouldn't disgrace 
the sport by calling myself a golfer, 

Bui now thai summer is here, in 
my spare time I've decided that I'm 
going to push myself lo become bet- 
ter at the most frustrating sport 
known to man. 

I've seen the lnfomercials for 
all of the gadgets thai are supposed 
lo help you improve your golf 
game And, I have lo say thai at 
three in ihe morning, they all look 
like they can tum me into the next 
Tiger Woods But on this cold and 
windy Saturday, 1 knew thai I could 
do il on my own. 



That thought must bav 
wrecked my concentration, because 
after that my arm bent, my head 
popped up and I couln't follow 
through because I hit the ground in 
from of the ball so bard that I 
thought the club was going to snap. 

It was one of those shots where 
the divii flew twice as far as the 
ball, which lay safely on the ground 
only four inches from where I teed 
the sucker up 

I was more than a little 
embarasscd. bui I laughed along 
with the fellows, deciding to take 
my mulligan and then convinced 
myself that ihe little white turd sit- 
ting on the tec wasn'i going lo make 
a fool of me anymore throughout 
ihe day. 

I summoned my courage and set 
my mind on taking an easy swing, 
but il jusl wasn'i meant to be. My 
competetive spirit took over and I 
realized that ii's just a teeny, tiny 
ball. Of course ihe next try 1 totally 
missed the damn ball I'm pretty 
sure iti.n I proved that 1 was quite 
capable of making a fool of myself.

Greek week to bring activities for everyone 



by NaUlit Hes 
Chkr Reporter 

A Spring Formal will conclude a 
string of recreational and social 
events scheduled for students, staff 
and faculty of the campus next week 

The annual Greek Week is sched- 



uled for Apnl 7 to 11 and includes 
daily activities. The advertising slo- 
gan is "Be Greek For a Week" and is 
targeted to get all of campus 
involved 

"We try to bring it back stronger 
eacb year." said Erin Fndb. president 
of Pi Beta Phi. 



Therefore, the Spring Formal 
scheduled for Friday of next week 
will be open to the entire campus for 
the First time ever In years past, a 
dance has been strictly organized for 
Greek social organizations. This 
event will distinguish it from the past 
routines of Greek Week. 



Summer Held school takes 
students out of the classroom 



by Jeremy Eecnbarger 
Editor 

Summer classes, .the thought Df 
them sounds depressing. Yet, what 
would students think of a class 
where there are no books, no tests 
and no classrooms? This summer a 
class will offer these exact things. 

Since 1988. the anthropology 
program and the continuing educa- 
tion credit program has offered an 
archeological field school thai 
allows students to excavate and 
research prehistoric sites. 

The six- week session provides 
six credit hours. Students enroll in 
"Fieldwork and Archeology," 
ANTH P405. Classes will meet 
Monday through Friday, from 8 a_m . 
to 4 p m . on May 19 to June 27. 

"It is a real interesting class for 
archeological students." said Deb 
Conklin, director of the continuing 
education credit program. 
"However, the class is open to any- 
one with an interest." 

Many students may wonder why 



continuing education is involved 
with this program. 

"We handle all courses that are 
off campus," said Conklin. "It's a 
way to finance the courses. This is a 
course thai wouldn't be able to be 
funded otherwise." 

"Students are taught the basic 
skills of Field archeology," said 
Robert Jeske. associate professor of 
sociology and anthropology. "It's 
like any classroom class. We are out 
excavating sites." 

According to Jeske, the plan for 
this year's work is to focus on test 
excavations at^everal archeological 
sites in the Fort Wayne area, includ- 
ing the dune site, located on cam- 
pus. The dune site is a 7,000 year- 
old Native American campsite that 
also has a historic pioneer compo- 
nent. 

The class will also meet at sev- 
eral sites near the St. Marys River 
Valley that has yielded large 
amounts of late woodland pottery — 
a rare occurrence in this area of the 
slate. 



Another area is located near 
Woodbum. The site is an estimated 
2,500 years old. 

The class will also spend some 
time learning and performing arche- 
ological survey techniques and labo- 
ratory methods. 

'There is a lot of paperwork 
involved," said Jeske. "When we 
excavate a site, we destroy it." 

According to Jeske. archeology 
is one of the only sciences that 
destroys the things that they are 
researching. Archeologists destroy 
things (hen try to reconstruct them 
on paper. 

Students need permission of the 
instructor to register. Space is limit- 
ed to 20 students. 

"If anyone is interested they bel- 
ter hurry and sign up," said Jeske, 
"Half the spaces are filled already." 

Students interested in 
more information about 
archeological field school 
should contact [he depart- 
ment Of sociology and 
anthropology, at 481-6842.
