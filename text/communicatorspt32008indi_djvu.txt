All good things take time 

Statistics shjONAAl^j^^dents are sticking around 



9 - 



By Kelly McLendon 

staff Wdter 

Lei's face ii: some- 
times it takes more 
llian four years to fin- 
ish a Gactielor's degree. 
While there's really no 
set time for graduation 
(most programs do have 
n maximum of 10 years 
for the credits to be ac- 
tive, though), most peo- 
ple lake about four years 
to complete a Bachelor's 
Degree. 

Those four long years 
will inevitably include 
some type of struggle, 
guaranteed. Whether it 
takes three chances lo 
pass Math IS3, or a read- 
ing intensive English 
class destroys a once-de- 
cenl G.PA one semester, 
there's bound to be a few 
obstacles. But don't wor- 
ry, there are many cam- 
pus initiatives oui ihere 
to help make graduation 
a reality for every stu- 
dent. 

First, there is statisti- 
cal evidence that shows 



the universitj' is growing 
as a productive campus 
with its retention initia- 
tives. Dr. lack Dahl, Asso- 
ciate Vice Chancellor for 
Institutional Research 
said, "There are numer- 
ous initiatives undenvay 
lo promote retention. 
The actual retention 
rates have fluctuated be- 
tivcen 67 perccent and 69 
percent in recent years." 

Most people would 
be surprised to know 
IPFW does indeed keep 
statistical information 
on enrollment fluctua- 
tions, graduation rates 
and drop-outs. 

Starting with enroll- 
ment fluctuations — it 
seems there are many 
morestudentsoncampus 
this year than in previous 
years, just by observation 
and the difficulty one ex- 
periences when trying lo 
find a parking spot. How- 
ever, information from 
the Office of Institutional 
Research and Analysis 
shows an increase in en- 
rollment in the past, but 
it is not as significant as 



It appears. 

According to the data. 
in 2007, enrollment in- 
creased by 271 people 
from the previous year, 
which is obviously, not 
much. Enrollment infor- 
mation for 2008 was not 
avail- rr^^^r^^=^^^ 
able at 
the time 
of pub- 
lication 
for this 



wonder il 
the enroll- 
ment changes could be 
related to any external 
factors, such as the fall- 
ing value of the dollar. 
Dr. Dahl said, "I have 
seen frequent com- 
ments, but no reliable 
statistics, which relate 
economic conditions to 
enrollment." 

The harsh economic 
conditions currently be- 
ing experienced in the 
United States seem to 
either profoundly re- 
duce, or encourage the Achievement Program. 



enrollment of students 
in college. "For some, 
economic hardships lead 
to ivithdrawal, while for 
others, economic chal- 
lenges are the motivation 
to seek further education 
in order to qualify for a 
b e 1 1 e r 
p o s i - 
tion." 

people 
are grad- 
uating 
from the 
univer- 
iity than 
in the 
past, however. "Gradu- 
ation rates have been 
increasing steadily in re- 
cent years, moving from 
21% to 26%." Dr. Dahl 
stated. 

There are many ser- 
vices available for those 
who feel they may need 
some extra support and 
assistance with complet- 
ing their degree. First, 
there is a program called 
ASAP!, which stands 
for Academic Student 



"In the end, it will be 

satisfying to walk away 

with a diploma and the 

idea of being able to find a 

higher paying job.

The program is "a stu-

The SOAR program, 
as well as FYE and the 
learning communities 
are also initiatives set in 
place by the university to 
help students' slay in col- 
lege. "All of these collab- 
orations focus on a clear 
theme: a recognition that 
students are more likely 
to stay in college when 
they are pan of a 



community that is 
supportive, challenging 
and celebratory." Dr. Wil- 
liam McKinney, the new 
Vice Chancellor for Aca- 
demic Affairs said. 

Dr. McKinney main- 
tained the position that 
the university is commit- 
ted to offering students 
the resources they need 
to graduate, 

"Since the ultimate 
academic celebration is 
commencement, IPFW 
is committed to offering 
our students those chal- 
lenging and supportive 
curricular and co-cur- 
ricular experiences that 
help students to reach 
their loftiest academic 
goals." 

The university's ef- 
forts don't end there, ei- 
ther. Dr. McKinney said 
every time is a good time 
to re-evaluate reten- 
tion efforts, regardless of 
whether enioUment is up 
or not.

Preserving Political Opinion 

Single Party Districts and their Dissidents 



By Louisa Danielson 

Politics WiiWf 



How will you vote in 
the upcoming clcciion? The 
way you casi your ballot 
may be a rcsull of ihe region 
in which you live, .says Mi- 
chael Wolf. Assislanl Pro- 
fessor of Political Science at 
IPBV. 

Wolf. Ihe 2006-2007 
Richard Lugar Riculry 
Scholar, recently explored 
ihc effects of regional poli- 
tics on the individual voter. 
His findings were discussed 
during 3 special presenta- 
tion this spring, as a part of 
Ihc Lugar program. 

"Political competition 
at Ihc Federal level is high 
overall." Wolf noted. How- 
ever, political competition 
at the Slate and local level 
isn't quite as intense. In fact, 
in some areas, one politi- 
cal party can dominate the 
system so heavily thai Ihe 
oilier party .has no chance 
of winning. This is called a 
'one-party' or 'single party" 
district - and there arc many 
in the United Stales. 

These single party dis- 
tricts, however united their 
voting records may appear, 
will always have dissidents 
- supporters of the opposing 
part) These are mmorily' 
voters \oItrs who sup- 
port the mmorit) pjrtj Al- 
though there will probably 
be minoniy pany \otcrs in 
any dislrtci Wolf was par- 
liLuhrlj iniLTLMtd m the ef- 



fect that the majority party 



)uld ha\ 



n the n 



iiy party in single party 
districLs. To explore this, 
he examined 40 different 
counties across the United 
Slates and compared the 
counties' voting results to 
Ihe national outcomes. 

What Wolf discovered 
was ihai Republicans have 
a tendency to adopt more 
liberal politics when they 
are immersed in Demo- 
c rat-rich district.s. But 
when Dcmocrais are in the 
minority of a Republican 
district, they tend to adopt 
more liberal policies than 
they would have had even 
if they were in a Democrat- 
held district. 

Especially important to 
this research Wolf noted. 
was observing the minor- 
ity voters' control over 
the information they took 
in. "Republicans always 
read more," he said. Wolf 
found that Republican vot- 
ers were more likely to 
read the newspaper regard- 
less of the political district 
in which they lived, while 
DemocraLS tended to avoid 
newspapers in Republican 
districts. He also found that 
Republicans were more 
likely lo pay allcniion to 
political articles than their 
Democrat counterparis. 

Also, Wolf discovered 
that minority voters, re- 
gardless of which party 
they supported, were al' 
ways extremely selective 
of the people with whom 



they discussed politics. Re- 
search found that people who 
voted for the minority party 
would avoid talking politics 
with their neighbors and co- 
workers; instead, they would 
opt to talk politics with ac- 
quaintances with beliefs 
similar id their own, such as 
fellow churchgoers. These 
voters exhibited a careful 
filtration process, what Wolf 
called "a heroic effort" to 
replenish their personal po- 
litical beliefs in the face of 
majority opinion. 

Is this obstinacy among 
minority voters lo cling lo 



and filter ihcir personal par- 
tisan opinions good for the 
American system of democ- 
racy? Wolf said that it was. 
"People arc coping." he 
said. 

Even though there may 
be sharp disagreemcnis 
atong party lines for indi- 
vidual voters, still there re- 
mains a system in which op- 
posing opinions can coexist 
in peace. Minority pany 
voters just have to work a 
litllc harder to preserve their 
political positions than their 
majority party neighbors.

In the past it has also 
been noted thai IPSGA has 
an image problem. Many 
Mudenis on campus either 
don't know we exist or don't 
understand what we actually 
do. 

This year we an; focused 
on creating an image that 
students can understand and 
appreciate Included in these 
image changes are a new 
student designed IPSGA 
logo, d greatly improved 

all marketing, and more 
focus on issues relevant to 
every student. 

IPSGA has huge poten- 
tial to better IPRV in almost 
every way possible. Students 
make this campus what it is. 
When we organize and uniic 
we have the capability to do 
great things, and fonunaicly 
we have faculty and staff 
that are more than willing to 
help us out and respect our 
opinions. 

This year, with the help 
of the students IPSGA plans 
on reaching the maximum 
potential possible.

With every new academ- 
ic year comes a fresh energy 
that seems to leak out of the 
students, staff, and faculty. 
This is definitely happening 
in the student government 
office here at IPFW, 

Already many changes 
have taken place or been 
introduced that aim to send 
a jolt of excitement through 
the student body, which in 
recent years has been some- 
what apathetic by most sian- 

This year Ihc IPSGA 
has big plans for improving 
campus life in various ways. 
We arc doing everything 
from streamlining internal 
policies and procedures to 
improving the overall image 
of .student eovcrnmcnl. 

In the past few years 
people have complained 
thai siudent government, es- 
pecially Ihc Student Senate, 
is so focused on rules that it 
limits the ability to actually 
be an active voice for IPFW 
siudcnts. This year we are

Surprise! IPFW Not One of the Worst Colleges in America 



By Abigail Kopen 

Op-Ed 

At the beginning of 
each and every school 
year we students iiear an 
awful lot about IPFW and 
how wonderfiil it is. We 
hear ourselves as a uni- 
versity being subtly com- 
pared to other, bigger 
universities. Important 
variables are brought to 
OUF attention such as our 
professors who ivill know 
us by name, our small 
class sizes, and our fan- 
tastic new housing. I for 
one have never gotten 
sick of hearing "One uni- 
versiiy, two great names." 
However, to make sure 
that it is not all in vain 
and that we are not being 



fed a bunch of lies, I have 
some almost completely 
accurate information 
that will make you glad 
you chose IPFW over 
Harvard. 

An article in the Sep- 
tember issue of Radar 
magazine tilled, "Bad 
Education: Presenting 
our annual semiscienflc 
guide to the worst col- 
leges in America," breaks 
down the worst places to 
pay for your education. 
Radar takes a look at 
graduation rates, accep- 
tance rates, overall safety 
and crime rates, price, 
as well as incorporating 
sources such as the U.S 
Department of Educa- 
tion, U.S News, World 
Report and the Princeton 
Review (I assume this is 



the semiscientific data?). 
Inventive in their cat- 
egories, Radar magazine 
separates these univer- 
sities and slaps on repu- 
tations such as "Most 
Superficial" (University 
of Southern California), 
"Ugliest Campus" (Drex- 
el University), "Biggest 
Rip Off" (Hampshire 
College) and of course 




the "Worst College in 
America", (University of 
Bridgeport). I am happy 
to say IPFW is not on this 
list and neither is I^irdue 
University or Indiana 
University. 

Entertaining though 
these slanders may be 
I can't help but wonder 
what makes this infor- 
mation in the least bit 



mm 



accurate? Whether or 
not Harvard University is 
ranked most overrated in 
a new magazine from the 
east coast, it is still one 
of the most prestigious 
universities in the world. 
Alas, I hnd myself leaning 
towards this "semiscien- 
tific" accusation. Radar 
includes that Harvard 
University, for example 
has an acceptance rate of 
9percent, andafouryear 
graduation rate of only 87 
percent all of this at a cost 
of 548,550. Pardon me 
when I say, "Screw that". 
Here in America, the land 
of opportunity and free- 
dom, the melting pot of 
the world, should I not 
be capable of graduating 
from IPFW with my four 
year degree in hand, get 



into a decent law school 
somewhere here in the 
unfonunately under- 
rated mid west, and still 
bring in the big bucks? By 
George, old chap I think I 
shall! And I don't need to 
wear a sweater-vest and 
slacks to do it. 

So where do we stand 
in comparison to diis 
list and all the big shot 
universities? Well In the 
spirit of logical and accu- 
rate information, I decid- 
ed that in the end, I just 
had to give IPFW its own 
classification. Greatest

to Graduate and Get On

great names,"

Poliiics a Money Editor 

The oil and coal in- 
dustry corporations have 
spent S427 million on 
lobbying and advenising 
during just the first half 
of this year. Wliat this 
means is that after this 
year is over these com- 
panies will have spent 
almost a billion dollars 
to insure that their inter- 
ests are taken care of by 
the government and me- 
dia. So what can we do? 
"We" is an organization 
devoted to changing die 
climate crisis. They are 




doing their part to com- 
bat against the interests 
of the oil and coal mul- 
tinationals through word 
Jth and citizen ac- 
tivism. If you would like 
to do your part to help 
make us an oil indepen- 
dent nation and push

From Page 1 



The student victim in 
the on-campus homicide 
was Liette "Lola" Marti- 
nez, a 22-year-old from 
New Mexico, who was 
Slabbed to death in her 
apartment. In a matter 
of days, Tina L Morris, 
mother of Maninez 's 
roommate was appre- 
hended by authorities 
and charged with the ho- 
micide. 

Frederick D. ]ones was 
shot to death on April 6 
at an off-campus party. 
Jones was a likeable, al- 
ways-smUing. 19-year- 
old Ashman from South 
Bend. Unlike the other 
homicide. Uie Fred Jones 
case remains unsolved. 

"We have concrete 
leads, but need the co- 
operation of the students 
to do anything," says Fort 
Wayne Cold Case Unit 
Detective, Loma RusseU. 

According to the City 
of Fort Wayne Police De- 
partment, Jones' case will 
remain open and needs 
help. "Fred Jones was a 
weU-liked guy and was 
an innocent bystander," 
said RusseU. 

Mo rris became a quick 
arrest once she stole a car 
and Qed to Indianapolis 
where she was caught. 

Final sentencing is set 
for September. 



If AUen County Judge 
Fran Gull accepts the 
plea agreement. Morris' 
prison sentence will have 
a ceiling of 60 years with 
parole eligibility after 30 
years. 

"We shouldn't have to 
worry about this," said a 
new student registering 
for the fall 2008-09 se- 
mester. That's what the 
students at Columbine 
thought. That thinking 
runs rampant in schools 
across the land. 

Since then. IPFW up- 
graded security in the 
dorms, ordered blue 
alert whistles (now be- 
ing distributed), fixed its 
"Reverse 9-1-1" emer- 
gency email and text- 
messaging notification 
system, and has heard 
its Chancellor publicly 
stress safety and security 
of people. 

Russell investigates 
cold cases and "on call" 
cases. On April 6, Russell 
was "on call" when the 
call came about a shoot- 
ing around the IPFW 
campus. RusseU took 
that call and has been 
the lead investigator on 
the Fred Jones case to 
this day. 

Russell's fhistradoR 
regarding the case of Fred 
Jones not being solved is 



directed at the students, 
those who attended the 
party of the shooting, 
and have not stepped 
forward. 

After four months of 
investigating the case, 
Russell expressed her 
disappointment. "We 
need the students to be 
responsible and come 
forward. They are not 
cooperating, and they 
know something. Are we 
to believe there were 50 
to 60 people in and out 
of a small apartment and 
nobody saw anything?" 

Russell is baffled as to 
why and pointed out the 
solution. "Maybe they're 
afraid of snitching. But 
they can come forward 
anonymously. That's 
simply irresponsible. Af- 
ter all, Fred was an inno- 
cent classmate, a victim, 
and they should want to 
help," she said. 

Russell urges stu- 
dents who know or saw 
anything, no matter how 
important or unimport- 
ant it may seem, to call 
either the tip hotline at 
436-STOP or call her at 
427-2290.

New VCD Chair Offers 

New Challenges 



By Marisha Zimmerman 



The Visual Communi- 
cations Departm3nt has a 
lot to look forward to this 
year in their new depart- 
ment chair, Dr. Haig Da- 
vid-West. 

Dr. David-Wesl holds 
multiple degrees, includ- 
ing a Ph.D. in Art Educa- 
tion from New York Uni- 
versity, a Master's degree 
in Graphic Design from 
the University of Wiscon- 
sin at Madison, a Bach- 
elor's degree in Graphic 
Design and Illustration 
from Ahmadu Bello Uni- 
versity in Nigeria, and has 
completed graduate de- 
sign studies at the Acade- 
my of Fine Arts in Warsaw, 
Poland. Before coming lo 
IPFW, he was the chair of 
the Department of Arts 
and Philosophy at Miami 




Dade College in Florida. 
He has also chaired de- 
partments at East New 
Mexico University and 
Chowan University in 
North Carolina. 

Currently, he is re- 
searching the expression 
of indigenous African 
iconography in Afro-Cu- 
ban visual arts because 
the African populations 
brought many of their 
traditions i.vith them from 



Cuba and Dr. David-West 
wants to find out how they 
express these traditions in 
their art and how it affects 
their culture and design. 
He is currently teaching 
courses this semester: the 
Senior projects course 
that is required before 
students' final exhibition 
and professional intern- 
ship. 

I caught up with Dr. 
David-West in order to 
find out more about his 
plans and thoughts for 
the Visual Communica- 
tions Department, how 
he feels about coming to 
IPFW, and what he brings 
to the department. 

Marisha Zinuner- 
man: What are some of 
the goals for the VCD pro- 
gram this year? 
Dr. David-West: It's very 
exciting. It's a wonder- 
ful faculty, and the pro- 



gram is very exciting, too. 
I want to show that we're 
very visible, and we're 
very competitive, and we 
have to know the strength 
of what other students 
from other universities 
are doing. It's important 
for our students to know 
what the students from 
other universities are able 
to do, what strengths they 
have. It doesn't matter 
where you graduate from, 
Harvard or Yale or where 
ever, you are in the same 
job market. So we want to 
make sure that wh.at we 
do is competitive. 

MZ: What are some of the 
challenges that have come 
with the department? 
DDW: The computer labs. 
That is a major challenge 
we're looking at; many of 
the computers are out- 
dated. But, of course, we 
are working in collabora-

Helping you get "FITT' 

Leading You to an Active Healthy Living 

By Joshua Collins 



Fitness Columnist 



A lot of clients come in and ask 
me how many times they should 
be working out each week and how 
long they should be in the gym for. 
Most people think that the longer the 
workout the better. This is not the 
case. 

The best kinds of workouts are the 
ones that only last for 45 minutes of 
continuous exercise. 

"FITT" stands for Frequency, 
Intensity, Time and Type. 

'Frequency' is how often you 
workout per week. 'Intensity' is 
how hard you're working, 'Time' is 
the duration of the workout itself. 
And finally, 'Type' is what kind of 
workout you're doing. These are good 
guidelines to follow and will allow you 
lo get the most out of your workout. 

Depending on your personal 
fitness goals, the frequency of your 
workouts should be benveen three to 
five times per week, I recommend a 
Monday through Friday routine with 
Monday, Wednesday and Friday as 
upper body workout days. Then use 
Tuesday and Thursday as your lower 
body days. Then, just flip upper body 
and lower body days for the next 
week. 

One other thing to remember 
is that you must do abs and cardio 
everyday. This is especially for weight 
loss. Upper and lower body muscle 
groups are the only things that need 
one day off lo recover, but your abs 
and cardio is something ihat should 
be done everyday for best results. 

The intensity of your wqrkout 
should high. Your better off running 
sprints for five minutes then you 
are to jog for 20 minutes. The more 
intense the workout, the better it is. 
Also, if you're jogging for 25 minutes, 
try doing one-minute intervals of 
running and jogging. This gets your 
heart rate up then brings it back 
down, then back up again. This bums 
off more calories. 

Time of your workout: You only 
want 10 be in the gym no longer than 
one hour and 15 minutes. You should 
be able to get your upper or lower 
body and your abs done in about 45 
minutes, and then the last 20-to-30 
minutes are used for your cardio. 
Keep this order also, as you should 
always finish with your cardio last. 

When you are on an exercise 
and doing your typical three sets of 
around 12-to-15 reps, only take a 20 
second rests in between sets. 

This will save you time and give 
you a more intense workout. The less

rest lime you have, the better your 
workout. 

Lastly, the type of workout you do 
plays a large role in whether you will 
see you results. You don't want to be 
running sprints if you're training for 
a marathon, or you don't want to be 
doing muscle endurance training 
if you're a power lifter. You need to 
train for what you want to do.

third and fourth on Saturday afternoon 
intheMeijerSKhosledbytheUnlversily 
of Dayton. 

Crysiina Martinez covered the 5K 
course in a lime of 1 8:32. That was just 
a second off of the pace put down by 
second place finisher Lilian lelimo of 
Cincinnati. 

Crystal Martinez crossed the line in 
a time of 18:34, just ahead of Rachel 



Patterson of Miami University (18:39).

just off the heels of being picked by 
Summit League coaches to take their 
second straight conference tide. The 
Mastodons recieved three first place 
votes in the balloting with 74 total 
points. Southern Utah was picked 
second with 73 points.

Point, Indiana was the Mastodons 
lop finisher with a time of 16:36, good 
enough for 38th.

Overtime thriller 



By Dan Vance 

SpatU Editor 

It was a game of rough play, 
highUghted by an unimaginable 
32 foul calls and eight yellow 
cards thrown. 

But all it took was one of those 
cards to allow Liridon Qafteshi to 
knock in a 46th minute penalty 
kick completing a Mastodon 
comeback. In the end, it was 
Qafleshi's goal that was the last as 
IPFW opened their season with a 
2-2 tie with Saint Joseph's. The 
match lasted through regulation 
and two overtime periods. 

St. Joseph's started the scoring 
early with hack-to-back goals by 
midiielder Tyler Kincaid within 



the first 14 minutes of thecontest, 
demoralizing the Mastodons. 

Keeper Alex Makin kept IPFW 
quiet for most of the remaider of 
the half, but faltered late, giving 
up a goal to Raphael Martinez, 

Martinez' goal in the 42nd 
minute sent the two teams to 
halftime with the visiting St. Joe 
team up 2-1. 

It was then just into the second 
half when Qafleshi chipped in his 
penalty kick to even things up. 

Neither team would be able to 
penetratre the opposing goal for 
the remaining time. 

Makin ended the match ivith 
four saves, IPFW senior Michael 
Knitter nabbed six saves of his 
own playing all 1 10 minutes. 

Thirty- two total shots were 



taken in the match, with 16 of 
them coming on goal. 

Greg Gerhig led both teams 
with seven shots, despite not 
being able to land any in net. 
Of St. Joseph's 10 shots on goal, 
Kincaid had five of them. 

IPFW was led in shots by Colin 
Helmrich and Qafleshi with 
three. Senior Aaron TXiUoch 
took two shots. Eight Mastodons 
combined for the 13 total shots. 

IPFW totalled half of the eight 
yellow cards in the match. They 
were recieved by Chris Dolinski, 
Tyler Misura, Josh Sommer and 
Qafleshi; the last of which came 
with just four minutes to play. 

St. Josephyellow card recipients 
were Jordan Jacobs, Nick Filloon, 
Gerhig and Kincaid. 



Young soccer squad 
Struggles on the road 

Three is currently not the favorite number of coach 
Margaret Saurin and the women's soccer squad. 

The team has just three upperclassman to go along 
with 13 true freshman. That youthful inexperience 
was hard to get by during the weekend's trip to 
bordering states. 

The women fell 3-0 to both Eastern Michigan and 
Wright State to drop to 0-3 on the season. 

In a non-conference match against Eastern 
Michigan, the game was 0-0 after a hard fought first 
halfin which freshmangoalkeeperMegan McLaughlin 
had two saves. 

In the second _. ^^ 

half, however, 
the 'Dons could 
not find the back 
of the net.

On Sunday, the teamed retuned to the field in 
Dayton, Ohio where they fell to the host Raiders of

Blockbuster Missouri-Illinois affair highlights week one of college football

ST. LOUIS - In a 52-42 victoiy overNo. 
20 Illinois, Missouri proved two things 
— their offense is still explosive, but the 
secondary needs plenty of work. 

Illinois' junior quarterback Juice 
Williams, who is bener known for 
his feet than his arm, torched the 
MU defense for 451 yards and four 
touchdowns through the air. 

But at the same time, the interior 
defensive couldn't have played much 
better. They eliminated any threat of 
an Illinois running game by lirruting 



them to 61 total rushing yuds and 2.3 quarterbackChaseDanielwasaperfect 

yards per carry. five of five for 50 yards including a 29 

Defensive end Stryker Sulak led the yard connection with junior receiver 

anack by racking up eight total tackles Jared Perry on the opening drive. 



including three sacks that resulted in 
27 lost yards for Illinois. 

"Obviously we could do a lot better, 
Sulak said. "If our 

DB's are looking ^^^^^^^= 
bad then it's the d- 
line's fault, we're

The MU offense

Missouri only trailed at one point in 
the game, and that was after Illinois' 
jimior defensive end Derek Walker 
intercepted a short pass by Daniel and 
took it back for six. The 270-pound 
lineman had an easy sprint to the end 
zone. 

Missouri continued to widen the 
margin in the second quaner and 
eventually opened up a 31-17 lead at 
half time. In a familiar scene, the Illini 
began a comeback late in the third 
quaner and cut Missouri's lead to as 
close as 10.
