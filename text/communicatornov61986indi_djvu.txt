Task force examines IPFW 




Chancellor Thomas Wallace 

By JOHN McGAULEY 
Staff Writer 

A widespread "Study of the Nature 
and Quality of Undergraduate Life at 
IPFW" has been initiated by Chan- 
cellor Thomas Wallace, with the ob- 
jective of improving, as he says, "the 
opoortunily for the best undergraduate 
experience in the state." 

Established in September, this effort 
is part of a total academic 
reorganization of IPFW Wallace had 
announced earlier this fall. Wallace had 
stated earlier, "we want to embrace 
education as a preparation for a 
lifetime." He also said he wanted to 
begin attracting some of those students 



who might normally turn to private 
universities for Iheir educational needs. 
That is part of the objective of the study 
on undergraduate experience. 

Organized into separate working 
bodies, the group conducting the study 
is concentrating on two general areas: 
Academics, and life of the un- 
dergraduate outside of the classroom. 
White the task force as a whole is 
chaired by Edward Nicholson, the 
groups on Academics is led by Van 
Coufoudakis, assistant dean of faculty 
and Dean John Ulmer is chairman of 
examining life outside of class. 

According to Chancellor Wallace, the 
main thrust of the group on student life 
is to determine what might create more 
of a school spirit among the student 
body. Items being considered are 
improvements to Walb Memorial Union 
Building and the possible merits of 
residence facilities. 

While the Union Building is part of 
the study, Wallace emphasized that any 
possible improvements will be im- 
plemented immediately, with some 
improvements possibly showing up 
next year. He sited the scheduled Nov. 
19 opening of a Women's Center and 
expanded use of the Multipurpose 
Building as examples of this. 

Among those areas being looked at in 
the area of academics are the use of 
teaching assistants and the size of some 
classes. 

Wallace said that a renewed national 
push for improved education was a 
major factor in his decision to initiate 
the study. He continued to say that. 
"we're seeing many people raising 
questions about the quality of 



education" and that many people are 
beginning to feel that "we can't just let 
the undergraduate simply sink or 
swim". To make IPFW more at- 
tractive, as Wallace put it, "we have to 
make the undergraduate experience as 
good as it can be". 

The Chancellor has put no restric- 
tions on the scope of the study group, 
saying that they have "complete 
freedom" to make recommendations in 
whatever areas they feel could be 
improved. 

So far, the task force has had several 
meetings since being convened in 
September, but is expected to use the 
entire academic year to make its final

Registrar explains 
compilation of classes 

By JOHN McGAULEY 
Staff Writer 

The process of assembling the schedule of classes at IPFW for the spring 
semester is now complete, and the resulting document has been available to 
students for about three weeks. Along with listings of available classes, the spring 
schedule lists the academic calendar and deadlines for registration and fee 
payments. 

According to Jack C. Daht, assistant vice chancellor and registrar, the process 
of scheduling classes is nearly continuous, with an individual semester being 
completed just seven weeks before it is sent to press for publication and 
distribution to the students. 

Each department decides which classes to offer. They then submit a course 
description to the registrar's office. The courses are assigned section numbers, 
room assignments, and they undergo an audit to assure the proper number of 
credit hours are being awarded for .that particular course. At this point, the 
selections are then returned to the individual departments on a review form. 

II it appears during early registration that the demand for a specific class is 
going to vary widely from that predicted by the department, the registrar's office 
will recommend that the schedule be reconsidered.

Department 
continues 
community 
education 

By JANET WIDDIFIELD 
Staff Writer 

Have you ever wanted to team 
basket weaving? Would you tike to learn 
about restoring your old home? How 
about brushing up on microcomputers, 
personal robotics or advanced car- 
diology? Then the place to turn is the 
office of continuing education, which 
offers courses in everything from 
supervision and leadership to 
photography and fine arts. 

Located in the Walb Memorial Union 
Building, Suite 210, continuing 
education is an extension or Community 
Outreach, which includes transitional 
studios, tabor studies, and general 
studies Wade Frederick is the director 
of Community Outreach and manages 
continuing education. 

According to Frederick, most of the 
students of continuing education are 
coming for non-credit courses. Con- 
tinuing education courses cannot be 
used toward a degree, although there is 
a certificate program in preschool for 
those interested in the child-care field. 
Taking the place of credits are con- 
tinuing educationunits, or CEU's, Each 
CEU accounts for 10 hours of study 
CEU's are nationally recognized units 
and can be used for advancement in 
one's employment. 

Frederick estimates that 90 percent 
of the courses are held on the IPFW 
campus. The remaining 10 percent are 
held in hospitals (for health carc- 
nursingi, and various businesses and 



SUBOG, senate plan 
student activities 



BySTACEYSCHAAB 
Staff Writer 

What has Students' Government and the Student Union Board of Governors 
(SUBOG ) been doing since school began? Quite a bit. First a look at SUBOG : 

Upcoming movies: Dec. 5 and 6, "The Night Before Christmas" and "101 
Dalmations"; April 10 and 11, "Top Gun." 

Concerts; several names are being considered at this time, including Pee Wee 
Herman. 

Trips: Florida for Spring Break, an annual trip, and a ski trip Jan. 3 through 11. 
Also being considered is a trip to the Bahamas and a trip to Europe. Area trips 
include the upcoming Oaken Bucket Trip on Nov. 22 and a shopping trip to Chicago 
on Nov. 29. 

Parlies: Hoagland Hayloft on Dec. I9,a(ter finals week is over. 

Workshops: Leadership training for the near future. 

Co-sponsored events: most recent was the Alice Walker teleconference Wed- 
nesday, Nov. 5. 

Mid-Day Diversions: Beginning Monday, Nov. 17, a euchre tournament will be 
held in Walb. Students are invited to attend and participate. Beginners tables will 
be available for those interested in learning how lo play. Snacks and music will be 
provided. 

Dances: a semi-formal dance is being considered by the governors but nothing 
has been set. 

Senate, too, has been busy planning ahead and working on projects, such as the 
purchase of four new typewriters in the Helmke Library Also, more legal aid for 
students is in the works, as part of the carry-over from Legal Services of Maumee 
Valley, Inc., which is no longer available on campus. 

Robert Alderman |R&gt;, a member of the House of Representatives for Indiana's 
19th district, wants to change the name of the university. Senate has written a 
resolution to keep the name Indiana- Purdue at Fort Wayne. 

Also, an advisory committee has been organized to respond to student com- 
plaints against the cafeteria iThe Fort) in Walb Memorial Union Building. Senate 
hopes to make Walb Memorial Union a student gathering place, and changes in the 
cafeteria may facilitate this. 

The Multipurpose Building now has extended hours, a result of work between the 
administration and the student senate. The building is now open 9 a.m.-3 p.m. 
Saturday and 2-5 p.m. on Sunday. 

Also, Senate would like to have parking tot No. 6, south of the library, changed to 
AB parking after 5:30 p.m. daily Student signature petitions are required for this, 
and petitions are available in the students' government office, on the second floor 
of the Walb Union building.

Drug abuse in sports: 
is drug testing the key? 



Why do people take drugs? Why to be 
more specific, do athletes? Especially 
when an athlete works so hard at making 
his-her body healthy ; to enable 
themselves to compete at their highest 
potential Drugs ruin an athlete's body 
and mind, not to mention the possibility 
of risking death. When athletes have so 
much going for them, why do they risk it 
all? 

We all agree that something must be 
done about the widespread use of 
cocaine, crack, and other drugs in 
sports. The reasons are simple! Drugs 
can kill. 

Consider for a moment, the hero 
worship that is endowed on athletes by 
young children. Children look up to, and 
admire athletes. Athletes are a role 
model to children; they want to grow up 
and be just like "the big boys." If drug 
use doesn't stop, will our young people 
grow up thinking drugs are "cool"? 

What is the answer? Some feel that 
drug testing is the key, while others have 
reservations about it. Why the 
reservations? The cost, for one, is a 
fqctor. Drug testing is so expensive that 
the only institutions able to afford the 
cost are pro-leagues or large scale 
universities. Aside from the high cost, 
you must consider the fact that the tests 
are often inconclusive. 

Why are the tests inconclusive? When 
an athlete is notified of his test, he is 
given a form to complete. One of the 
questions on the form will ask if cold 
medicine is being taken. Certain over- 
the-counter cold medicines make a drug 
test react positively The test is thrown 
out when an athlete states he's taking 
these medications. All an athlete has to 
do is lie about taking these medications. 
A retest is usually rescheduled for 
approximately two weeks later. If an 
athlete abstains from drugs for the two 



weeks before the test is administered, 
his results will be negative. So his drug 
abuse goes undetected, the athlete goes 
back to his old ways, and no one is the 
smarter until he is found dead like so 
many other athletes in recent weeks. 

Still others feel that athletes are not 
important enough to be drug tested. 
Some feel that the money should be 
spent on public safety — such as drug 
testing for air traffic controllers, 
transportation system workers like bus 
drivers, and police and fire department 
employees. 

If drug testing is not the answer, and 
athletes are not important enough to be 
considered for it, what do we do for the 
athletes that are on drugs? How do we 
stop the widespread use of cocaine? 

Couldn't an alternative be to totally 
cut the athlete out of the sports program 
that he is involved in ... to never let him 
play college or professional sports 
again? If the testing doesn't work, and 
they make no effort to quit, then take 
their livelihood away. That is one way to 
show children that drugs are not 
acceptable, or the "cool" thing to do. 

If the athlete wants help and honestly 
makes an effort to get it, then why can't 
professional sport clubs offer a 
counseling service for their athletes? If 
management and players work together, 
maybe they can come up with a solution 
together. 

When an athlete is caught using illegal 
drugs, give him a jail sentence — just 
like any ordinary person would be given. 
Quit letting them off because of who they 
are. Make them tell who their suppliers 
are so that the problem can be 
eliminated at the point where it begins. 

Together a solution must be reached. 
The widespread use of narcotics must be 
eliminated from college and pro sports. 
If not for today's athletes, then for the 
sake of future athletes.

Creating an Academy Award winner 



Stop playing games and 
streamline registration 



Many events and processes at EPFW 
are well run and helpful to students. 
Registration is not one of them. 

Aside from the long lines, inefficient 
ways of telling when a class is closed 
and the necessity of spending an entire 
day scheduling classes, there are more 
serious problems with the system. 

One of the problems is the counseling 
service. All freshmen are required to 
start out in Student Academic 
Counseling, rather than the department 
their major is in. Why? All this method 
does is put a bigger burden on SAC. 
Counselors can not provide good advice 
if they are harried and have thirty other 
students knocking down their door. 

Students are also being encouraged to 
"see your counselor early." This seems 
pointless when considering -the time 
lapse between the moment a student 
sees their counselor and the moment 
they can actually register. By then 
classes can close. Then it's back to the 
counselor. Students should probably 
wait until registration day to see their 
counselors : just in case the 
administration again miscalculated how 
many students are interested in taking a 
specific course. 

Furthermore, why do students have to 



rush all over the building to register? 
Wouldn't it be simpler to have 
registration all in one room? Or one 
area? Even on one floor? 

It's obvious that the 1PFW 
administration believes that registration 
should be like a treasure hunt game. 
Students run all over until they finally 
reach the treasure: a schedule of classes 
for the coming semester. 

Possibly the treasure hunt is rooted in 
tradition and the counselors and 
administration can not bear to part with 
it. There are some traditions that are 
fairly harmless and lots of fun. 
Registration, however, does not fall in 
that category. 

The administration should realize that 
by keeping their security blanket they 
are undermining the students' welfare. 

By not implementing much needed 
change, the administration is playing 
games with its student body and keeping 
IPFW a fledging, "child-like" school 
when it could be an adult university. 

Maybe the students could make a deal 
with the system. The students get a new 
registration process and the 
administration can keep their teddy 
bear. 



Tony walked into the ar- 
chitect's office. He had an 
appointment, he told the 
receptionist. The woman 
glanced up at the young 
man, then down at her ap- 
pointment book. Perhaps 
later, she told Tony: her 
employer was busy now. 

Tony turned to leave, when 
a handsome, lively-eyed 
ramrod-backed man strode 
into the office. The boy 
seized the opportunity, "t 
came to see you, sir," he 
said. "I want to be an ar- 
chitect — just like you!" 

The man smiled, said he 
hoped his young visitor had 
higher aspirations than that 
— and then, with a wave of 
his hand, beckoned Tony to 
follow him. 

The architect's private 
office was a clutter of mock- 
ups and half-completed 
drawings. Tony had broughl 
a portfolio which he opened 
eagerly for his host. 

Tony was a junior in high 
school, he explained. His 
plans for a supermarket had 

contest there. As Tony 
turned pages the architect 
arched an eyebrow 

After a moment the man 
stared straight into Ihe face 
of his young guest. "Why do 
you want to be an ar- 
chitect?" he asked. 




Tony could see the gen- 
tleman wanted an un- 
varnished answer, and so he 
gave it. He said exactly what 
he fell. He said human 
beings "live wrong " He said 
they were not meant to live 
in boxes. He said it's enough 
they were going to spend 
eternity in a box. Why did 
they have to do the same 
with their lives? 

The architect nodded 
approvingly. With a 
philosophy like that, Tony 
just might grow into one of 
the greats. There was, 
however, one thing that 
would stand in the boy's way 
— one thing that would 
surely prevent him from 
selling his ideas to 
prospective clients: his 
speech impediment. 

The architect asked Tony 
to open his mouth and lift his 



tongue. When the boy did, 
the man peered inside. Just 
as he had suspected. Tony 
had excellent teeth — but the 
piece of skin beneath his 
tongue — something called 
the "frenum" — was too 
thick.lt was preventing him 
from enunciating clearly — 
was making him literally 
"tongue-tied." 

Being an inventive draft- 
sman was not enough, said 
the architect. Tony must 
first learn to be an effective 
communicator. He must see 
a doctor and get that con- 
nective tissue cut. Then he 
must "go somewhere and 
learn to speak." And then he 
must return — and become 
the architect's student. 

He went out and had the 
operation. Just as the ar- 
chitect had told him it would, 
the surgery untied his 



tongue. In fact his tongue 
flopped around so freely in 
his mouth, he could scarcely 
control it. 

So Tony opened the Yellow 
Pages in search of a voice 
teacher. 

He found an ad for a school 
run by a former actress 
named Kalherine Hamil. He 
went there. He told Miss 
Hamil he could not afford 
tuition, but lhat he would be 
glad to do janitorial work in 
exchange for elocution 
lessons. She agreed. In time, 
Tony was ready to return to 
Ihe architect'; office to begin 
his apprenticeship. 

But he never did. 



For after his coaching at 
Miss Hamil's school, Tony 
simply became too good at 
speaking to consider a 
career in anything else. 

A bright future had 
awaited him in the office of 
an architect — the man who 
untied Tony's tongue — the 
great Frank Lloyd Wright. 

Yet instead, Tony look 
lhat new voice — and shared 
it with the , world — 
as Academy- A ward- winning 
actor Anthony Quinn. 

That is THE REST OF 
THE STORY.

The ciub, re-organized 
after several years of dor- 
mancy, is sponsored by 
Robert Hawley, associate 
professor and program 
director for the department 
of mental health technology, 
and organized by David 
Gurtner, a senior electrical 
engineering technology 
major and Mana 
Dcrakhshani, a lecturer in 
the department of modern

Spring schedule 



According to Dahl, this semester's scheduling procedure 
went about as well as initially planned, with some internal, 
administrative problems being encountered. He continued to 
describe the trouble as "simply an experiment that didn't 
work as we hoped it would" and declined to comment further. 

Linda Balthaser, assistant dean of the arts and letters 
department, said that in determining what is to be offered, 
each department must first consider what the needs are of 
the students working towards majors in a particular area. 

Secondly, an awareness of others, needing only one or so 
courses is maintained. An attempt to offer those courses Is 

Balthaser concurred with Dahl that scheduling is indeed an 
ongoing process She added that the spring schedule just 
released was actually started this past April and refined last 
month. The schedule for the current semester was begun in 
January of this year.

William Hurt needs to be quiet 



By ROY QUINCE 
STAFF WRITER 
When a film reveals an 
actress of overwhelming 
eroticism, contrasting her to 
an actor filled with a 
stoicism of continental 
magnitude, something has to 
give. The main thing that 
goes is William Hurt's pre- 
eminence in "Children of a 
Lesser God" 

Hurt does all the speaking 
in the film, for himself, for 
his deaf pupils, for the 



spectacular, unrelenting 
Marlee Matlin, even for his 
cat. We have to wail for the 
very last frame of the film 
for him to become quite. It 
reveals a particular bigotry 
on the part of the film 
makers, believing we could 
not understand some of the 
sign language. Almost every 
gesture is translated. 

Mr. Hurt has the calming 
ability to move the planes of 
his face, so to appear as a 
mountain of stolidity, the 



shadows of his 
emotions drifting by like 
clouds Ms. Mailing talent is 
much more arresting. She 
uses the planes of her body to 
project restless, intense 
sensuality. 



Review 



Her true rival is Piper 
Laurie, who plays her 
mother. Laurie com- 
plements Matlin's per- 
formance with maturity and 
o ripeness that suggests 



Oscar to anybody with a lick 
of sense. 

The director and the music 
editor have learned a well 
Uiuyhl lesson from Visconti's 
"Death in Venice" using 
slow, mysterious music to 
accompany shimmering 
water images Unfortunately 
the music is sub-Mahler, and 
the Atlantic no substitute for 
The Venetian Lagoon. The 
landscape may be cold in 
this film, bui the characters 
are most definitely hoi. 



Fort Wayne National Bank stresses 
'We've got the best right here' slogan 



Fort Wayne National Bank is sponsoring a free poster give 
away. The poster is entitled, "Fort Wayne." 

"Fort Wayne National has always been supportive of Fort 
Wayne," states bank president, Paul Shaffer. "We really do 
believe we have 'Ihe best right here' and these posters will 
remind people of that." 

The posters are a reproduction of a painting the bank had 
commissioned by artist Maurice Papier. 

Papier is chairman of the art department at St. Francis 
College. He is also listed in "Who's Who in American Art" 
and "Who's Who in American Education." His work is 
displayed in IB to 20 corporate collections and over a hundred 
private collections. 



"Fort Wayne Posters are part of an overall campaign to 
promote this city." Fort Wayne National presented Fort 
Wayne Chamber president, James Ditoe and director of 
economic development, Thomas Lalchem with framed 
posters Oct. 13, 1986. 

The campaign also includes ten second and 30 second 
television spots depicting the quality of life here in Fort 
Wayne. 

Anyone who would like a poster can stop by any Fort 
Wayne National Bank and request one. The painting itself 
can be viewed at the Main Office of Fort Wayne National 
Bank, HOW Berry St Framed posters can be seen at all the 
branch offices. 



Children need S. C.A.N, 's support 



By MICHELLE LYNN 

ERTEL 

Staff Writer 

In 19B5, there were 476 

substantiated cases of child 

abuse and neglect in Allen 

County. These statistics 

indicate that more than one 

child per day was abused or 

neglected in our community 

according to SCAN 

statistics. 

SCAN stands for Suspected 
Child Abuse and Neglect and 
is a service to help prevent 
child abuse and neglect 
through special program. 
SCAN does not report child 
abuse and if anonymous 
phone calls are received, 
they refer them to the 
Welfare Department which 
in (urn handles the situation. 

SCAN has a Parent Aide 
Program which is to prevent 
initial or reoccurring in- 



cidences of child abuse and 
neglect. For parents who are 
at risk of abusing or 
neglecting their children 
SCAN has trained volunteers 
who provide counseling and 
role modeling in a structured 
goal-oriented manner. 
Parents who are at risk of 
abusing a child have been 
identified as being frustrated 
with parenting. To help 
parents, the program is 
aimed at increasing self- 
reliance and improving self 
image. 

Another program is the 
Group Insight for Teens 
(GIFT Program). This 
program is a support group 
for adolescent victims of 
abuse and neglect. These 
youths are referred to this 
program by the Adolescent 
Unit of Child Protective 
Services or the Allen County 
Department of Welfare. The 



first goal of the program, 
according to SCAN, is to help 
the adolescent develop 
constructive behavior 
patterns to be used now, to 
help cope with un- 
satisfactory home en- 
vironment. 

The second goal is to help 
the youth apply these 
behavior patterns into all 
aspects of their daily living 
and even into adulthood. 

This goal is accomplished 
by providing the teens with a 
forum where they may 
freely express their feelings, 
learn acceptable methods of 
handling life situations and 
stresses, acquire new per- 
ceptions of parenting, and 
receive nonjudgemental 
support from peers and 
adults. 

SCAN also has a Council on 
Child Abuse and Negelct 



(COCAN) and is the 
facilitator of the council for 
professionals from 50 social 
service organizations in 
Allen County. COCAN has 
programs or services that 
access the problem of child 
abuse and neglect and 
facilitates child abuse and 
neglect services in our 
community. 

SCAN is a nonprofit social 
service organization 
operated by an independent 
board of directors, and 
composed of dedicated 
volunteers from all 
segments of the community. 
They are always looking for 
clerical volunteers to work a 
couple of days a month, 
according to Chris Jem- 
meson a volunteer at SCAN.

Thursday, Nov. 6, 1986 



By DARREN J 
WAGGONER 

Sporls Editor 

IPFW women's basketball 

coach Julie Calahan returns 

three letterwinners from last 
season's 10-16 team. She will 
try to successfully blend 
their lalenls with those of six 
freshmen and one junior 
college transfer. 

The biggest losses came on 
the front line as Clara 
Trowbridge completed her 
four-year career and fresh- 
men Lynn Meinerding and 
Terri Lydy chose not to 
return to school. Lydy led the 



team in points per game 
(16.3) and rebounds (10. 
last season. She was also 
named Great Lakes Valley 
Newcomer-of-the-Year. 

"Offensively, we're ob- 
viously going to look for the 
fast break and try to create 
action," Calahan said. 
"We're going to run an of- 
fense thai puts every player 
in every position, and we'll; 
have to try to pull our op-! 
portent's big people out of the 
middle." 

"Defensively, we'll have to 
vary the pressure by 
changing the took of the

defense. We'll be gambling 
and aggressive becau: 
we're not, the other teams 
can overpower us with their 
size. We're going to be 
scrappy and exciting ... 
that's really the nature of the 
players on the team " 

Lori Miller had the most 
productive year of the 
returning players, averaging 
9.9 points and 3.6 rebounds. 
She drives well and has a 
good baseline jumper. She'll 
be counted on for a lot of 
rebound support also. 

Bev Miller and Angie 
Heingartner are the other 



PREGNANT? 




two returning playei 
S'4", Bev Miller is one of the 
Taster guards on the squad. 
She is a dedicated worker, 
and has improved her 
strength and quickness 
during the summer. Look for 
her to assume a majority of 
the leadership duties since 
she is the lone senior on the 
team. Heingartner. a 5'6" 
swing player, has a good 
outside touch and rebounds 
well for a player her size. 

Cynthia Rodgers, a 
transfer from Glen Oaks 
Community College, is 
probably the team's quickest 
player at 5'4". Other 
newcomers, all freshmen, 
include Crista Cook, Becky 
Matanic, Nancy Townsend, 
Michelle Crist, Teena 
Merrell and Chris Ren- 
ninger. 

Crist, recruited as a point 
guard, scored 18 points a 
game for Alexandria High 
School last year. She was 
named as honorable mention 
all-slate the last two years 
and earned all-conference 
and all-area honors for all 
four years. 

Malanic was LaPorte High 

School's Most Valuable 

Player last year while 

iging 16 points and six 

rebounds a game. She also 



Merrell averaged 17.6 
points a game at Nor- 
thwestern High School in 
Kokomo last season. She was 
MVP her junior and senior 
years and should be quite 
valuable to the team. She 
can play well both inside and 
outside, which is not bad Tor 
a 5' 10" player. 

Renninger, 5'10", was 
team captain at Bishop 
Luers and will be counted on 
to help out underneath.

averaged 17.5 points a game 
at Caston High School last 
year. She was also named 
MVP at Caston while ear- 
ning all-conference honors. 
"Sometimes it's easy to be 
complacent as a freshman," 
Calahan said of her young 
squad. "Not that many 
people get to play a great 
deal right away, and it's 
easy to sit back and relax 
and wail for your turn. 
That's not the case here this 
year, and Ihey all know they 
have a shot. They can't play 
like freshmen if we're going 
to be successful." 

The learn should benefit 
from the 19'9" three point 
shot thai was adopted this 
season by Ihe conference 
Calahan feels she has 
several players who can 
connect from that range. 

The season opens with a 
couple of home games. 
November 22 at 3 p.m. 
against Oakland University 
and a November 25 game 
with Indiana Tech at 7.30 



Soccer ends with win 



By JENNY BLAKLEV 
STAFF WRITER 

The leaves are rapidly 
diminishing from the trees, 
and the temperature is 
falling as well, signalling a 
change ol season ap- 
proaching. This change also 
indicates a shift of sports 
seasons. The fall sports are 
winding lo a close, including 
soccer. 

The Mastodons completed 
their regular season last 
Saturday, with a trip lo Ihe 
Bluegrass State IPFW 
defeated Kentucky Wesleyan 
3-1 closing out their regular 
season play with an 8-5-1 
record. Kentucky Wesleyan 
provided an interesting 
challenge for the Mastodons. 
"We played well at times, 
and not so well at times," 
comments Soccer Coach Jim 
Sharpe. "11 was hard lo keep 
our heads into Ihe game, and 
our concentration up, 
because Kentucky wasn't a 
d team."

indicative of the team's 
performance, according to 
Bronn Pfieffer. "We 
dominated the whole game. 
Their only goal was on a 
penalty kick ( whick was 
from our mental mistake)," 
Pfieffer injects. 






ather 



the 

Saturday 
established a dismal mood, 
including the outcome of the 
match at IPFW. On October 
25, the Mastodons lost a 
hard-fought baltle to Ohio 
Wesleyan, then the number 
two learn in Division III, 
with a score of S-3. Not- 
withstanding the defeat, 
Sharpe was not critical of the 
Mastodon's play. "We didn'l 
play loo badly," Sharpe 
states. "Actually, we played 
fairly well." He adds lhat the 
physical play was not at the 
heart of the loss. "A few 
mental mistakes cost us the 
goals," Sharpe says. "We 
attacked and moved the ball 
very well " 

Bicardo de la Torre 
echoes Sharpe's thoughts. 
"There were a lot of team 
mistakes at the beginning of 
the game," de la Torre 
states. "We can't afford to 
make those mistakes against 
Ihe number two team in the 
nation." 

In retrospect, Sharpe 
seems slaisfied wilh the 
season thus far. "We didn't 
get beat by anyone Lhat 
shouldn't have beaten us," 
Sharpe asserts. "I'm fairly 
pleased with the way things 
went. "We've had a pretty 
successful 'season." 



Pfieffer sums up, "We 
don't have the most talented 
learn, but we always give it 
our all. We play well as a 
learn; we don'l play as a 
bunch of individuals." 

As a result of the earlier 
defeat of conference foe 
Indianapolis, the Mastodons 
gained the second seed in the 
Northern Division and the 
home-field advantage for the 
firs! game of the Great 
Lakes Valley Conference 
Tournament The contest 
was played Wednesday, Nov. 
5. and barring a victory over 
Indy, IPFW will be Chicago- 
bound, travelling to Lewis 
University The possible 
opponents of the Mastodons 
Saturday include Northern 
Kentucky and Southern 
Indiana, from the Southern 
Division Sharpe voices his 
opinion on the learns, "I hope 
that we will play Northern 
Kentucky, because we 
played well against them 
before. Southern Indiana has 
a very good learn." 

If ihe Mastodons advance 
lo the finals of the tourney, 
Ihey could meet Lewis, the 
number one seed in the 
Northern Division. Con- 
cerning the playing con- 
ditions, Sharpe'assesses, 
"Lewis has a narrow field, 
which is an advantage to 
them. But we have played up 
there, so we know what to 
expect." 

De la Torre has high ex- 
pectations for the team's 
performance in the tour- 
nament. He comments, "If 
we play to our potential, we 
should win the lournament."
