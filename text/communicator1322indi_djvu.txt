The case that led to Ihe Supreme 
Court becoming involved in the matter 
of constitutionality, was a suit filed by 
the stales of Idaho and Arizona against 
the United Stales government in May 
1979 The slates question Congress' 
extension and maintaining that il is Ihe 
right ul a stale legislature lo rescind its 
own ratification vote. 

The case came to Idaho federal court 
on Dec. 23. 1961 Idaho Federal Judge 
Manon J. Callistcr ruled that Congress 
had indeed violated the Constitution by 
extending the deadline for raiilicaiicn 



request lo expedite 

Because the court's 1981-82 docket Is 
full, il Is unlikely thai the justices will 
rule on the case until the slart of Ihe 
net I term this fall. 

In any case, the question of 
Congressional authority may be 
academic if the minimum of 38 slates 
don't ratify Ihe ERA by June 30 Since 
most stale legislatures convened in 
January and end their sessions by 
March or April, the chances of passage 
are dwindling everyday

opinion 



Faculty should 
better advise 



seven weeks into the semester a' 
1PFW some disturbing talk is making its 
way around Ihe campus Some students 
are upsei because they just realized 
Ihey're In a class (hat they dnn'l need. 

Others arc finding out lhat maybe Ihcy 
dldn'l have Ihe prerequisites (or a class 
and now are struggling to keep their 
head above water. 

Why Is Ihls a major problem at IPFW? 
The Communicator feels the faculty in 
many departments at Ihe University 
need some brushing up on their pre- 
registrntion counseling consultations 
with students 

An alarming amount of "bad advice" 
is coaling students at IPFW valuable 
academic time and money. Ai a com- 
muler campus such as ours a mistake or 
Iwulnelasses taken can mean additional 
semesters spent trying to receive a 
degree, since many classes offered arc 
on an every-olher'Semester schedule. 

By means of an Informal survey taken 
by Ihe Communicator, we found lhat Ihe 
departments contacted wcreall satisfied 
with the means ol counseling taken by 
their individual faculty members. 

All said that sludenls are expected to 
be familiar with (he IPFW Bulletin. 
which lists class descriptions and 
academic schedule planning guides to 
fulfill major and minor sludics. The 
Communicator agrees with this claim. 



Sludenls have a responsibility to 
themselves to keep abreast of what they 
do and do not need academically. 

Students, especially those nol familiar 
with college schedule planning, do make 
mistakes though. This should be where 
ihe faculty counseling comes into play. 
Unfortunately, in many cases this is nol 
happening. 

The Communicator has learned lhal 
some sludenls have wlaked into coun- 
seling sessions for an adviser's 
signature, and without hesitation had 
(heir registration card signed. 
sometimes by unauthorised personnel. 
No attempt was made to check for 
errors. That type of situation saves time, 
but how accurate can il be? 

The Communicator feels it's lime for 
all department heads to send out letters 
lo faculty members reminding them of 
Ihe importance of counseling, before 
each semester a( IPFW. Faculty 
members should already be aware of 
this, but apparently Ihey are nol. 

Maybe It's lime for faeully members 
(o lake a refresher course on Ihe skill 
and importance of academic advising. 

Good counseling is so important lo a 
student's quick advancement through 
school, but the kind of counseling some 
sludenls have received is a major 
detriment.
