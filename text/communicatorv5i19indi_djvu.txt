Orientation flops; 
Able blames Brandt 



By MARK FRANKE 



New student i 
was cancelled for a lack of interest 
last Friday, as only three of the 500 
invited showed up. Student Body 
President Brock Able blamed the 
program's failure on orientation 
committee chairman Donna Brandt 
and her "new and innovative ideas." 

"This was Donna Brandt's (ideal 
again," said Able. "Another hummer 

Able was particularly critical of 
the voluntary nature of orientation 
attendance. "If you leave it up to a 
freshman to come to Friday afternoon 
orientation or go home, he'll go 
home," said Able. 

Miss Brandt, who has served as 
chairman of the committee for the ' 
last two years, could not be reached 
for comment on Abie's charges. 

Miss Brandt was defended by 
Charles Pratt, a student member of 
the committee. "I don't think it's 
right to blame Donna Brandt," said 
Pratt. "I would blame the students for 
this program, and that includes 
myself." Pratt said that he attended 



only one of the committee's meetings. 
Attendance of the other student 
members of the committee was not 
much better, according to William 
Heller of the Counseling and Acade- 
mic Development Division (CADD). 
Heller thought that only one student 
was present for more than one 
meeting. 



s Miss Brandt, also served on 
the committee. 

"There are two options left to the 
university," said Pratt. "If they want 
an orientation program, attendance 
should be required. Or, they should 
discontinue orientation entirely." 

Pratt said that this decision 
should be made with input from the 
Student Senate. "I think they should 
study it and make some proposals," 
he said. 

"The push for orientation would 
have to come from Students' Govern- 
ment," said Pratt. He added that 
planning should be a "50-50 split" 



between Students' Government and 

the administration. Administrative 
responsibility 



reform was total student control of 
the program. "Hopefully next year 
they'll let the students do it all," he 



1 program for this 
"accomplish- 
ing all those dry things that the 
students have always been told" in a 
more meaningful manner, according 
to Miss Brandt. 

Miss Brandt, who is associate 
director of CADD, said that the 
program was planned for after 
classes had begun because the past 
history had shown too many conflicts 
during the vacation period. 

Orientation has been plagued 
with dwindling attendance during the 
past three years.

Campus announces policy 
for snow emergencies 



The snow emergency policy 
procedures for Indiana-Purdue are: 

The heads of the school, the 
chancellor of the I.U. faction, and the 
dean and director of the Purdue 
faction, will decide if and when to 
declare a snow emergency. 

The university then will be 
declared officially closed until the 
emergency situation has abated. 
University Relations officers will be 
requested to draft appropriate state- 
ments for the news media. The Office 
of Safety and Security will be 
responsible for notifying all students 
and staff on campus. 

All students shall be immediately 
excused from on-going activities and 
will be expected to vacate all 
buildings and depart from the 
university premises. 



Members of the clerical and 
service staff, except for those 
required for emergency service, are 
relieved from official duties and are 
expected to depart from the univer- 
sity as quickly as possible. 

All parking lots and thorough- 
fares on the university property are to 
be emptied as soon as possible after 
the announced closing. Owners of

contest, a Male Hairiest contest, and 
a Women's Weight Lifting contest. I 
think it'll be fun!" said Stacey L. 
Osborn, a Circle K member. 

Circle K member Jim Adams said 
that there will be total city co-opera- 
tion as the army reserves, mayor's 
office, Kiwanis Club, Radio and T.V.

Ice cream social? In January? Since no one attended the orientation, Donna Brandt felt 
no one would enjoy the social either - and cancelled It! 

Purdue faculty accepts 
academic structure 



By REX PUTT 

The new proposed Academic 
Structure Plan for Indiana-Purdue 
Fort Wayne was accepted by the 
Purdue Faculty Senate in a meeting 
December 15, 1973. 

The plan, which presently per- 
tains only to the Purdue side at Fort 
Wayne, was drawn up by the 
Academic Structure Development 
Committee. The committee was 
created in December of 1970. It had 
worked on the plan off and on for 
three years, whenever permitted to 
do so by the Purdue administration. 

The Academic Structure Plan, 
which has only passed the first step 
for acceptance, has caused mixed 



of excluding negotiations with Indi- 
ana. Dr. Sheldon Gottlieb, professor 
of biology, voiced this opinion. 

"This plan is an initial work 
doctrine that should be altered and 
expanded on," he said. 

He continued to explain that the 
plan was an interesting structural 
plan for Purdue, but, he asked, "What 



Dr. Gottlieb said, "The commit- 
tee should consider the realities. They 
must also deal with the merger of the 
structure which would include Indi- 
ana's academic structure." 

He expressed concern for the 
inability of the Purdue side to 
negotiate with the Indiana side, but 
said he feels that negotiation is 
inevitable. "The two universities 
must deal with each other," he said. 

Dr. Gottlieb has attempted to 
bring the two universities together. 
Earlier in the first semester of the 
73-74 school year he proposed a 
resolution in a Purdue Faculty Senate 
meeting calling for the merger of 
Indiana and Purdue. His proposal was 
defeated. 

In reaction to this group that is 
dissatisfied with the action taken, Dr. 
Kenworthy contributed his support. 
"One bunch thought it silly to pass the 
plan since we have to go with Indiana, 
but I think that it is necessary to get 
this plan through as a starting point in 
negotiations," he said. 

Dr. Kenworthy went on to explain 
that the plan was presently only on 
paper, and that it will be the attitude 
of the faculty which will determine if 
the plan can become a reality for the 
entire Fort Wayne campus. 

He added with an optimistic note 
that "No system is going to work if 
there is bad faith and a bad will, but if 
there is good will, the chances of a 
satisfying system will become poss- 



ible," 

He emphasized that the plan is 
"forward-looking" and that if it 
becomes accepted by all channels, it 
will depend upon the faculty and 
adminislralion as to whether il can be 
an effective attribution to the 
improvement of education. 

Dr. Kenworthy cited the two-col- 
lege formation and the curriculum 
councils as the basic strengths of tin.' 



the key units of the university. The 
curriculum councils are set up to 
function as mini-colleges, he said, and 
therefore are appropriately designed 
to conform with the principle academ- 
ic structure theories of Purdue 
University. 

Dr. David McCants, head of the 
communications department, said 
that he was "favorably disposed" to 
the plan. 

He held a positive attitude toward 
the plan and acknowledged that it was 
a good plan that had possibilities. 

Dr. McCants, speaking about the 
plan, said, "I like the simplicity of the 
two colleges, but I question whether 
the faculty is large enough to handle 
the four or five separate areas in each 
school." 

Dr. Kenworthy didn't feel there 
was any problem involving numbers. 



"I don't see anything sacred in the 
numbers," he said. 

The committee was hindered 
because they had to work within the 
limits of Purdue in Lafayette. The 
committee was allowed to set their 
own judgements in drawing up the 
plan, but they stilt had to follow the 
guidelines set up by the administra- 
tion in Lafayette. 



Fort Wayne Faculty Senate, it will be 
sent to Probost Robinson for review. 
If he approves it, it will then be 
forwarded to the Purdue Board of 
Trustees. If he fails to accept it, it will 
return to Purdue Fort Wayne for 

If the plan passes through the 
Board of Trustees, it will be brought 
back to Fort Wayne and presented to 
the Indiana side. 

Dr. Kenworthy expressed hope 
that the plan would be approved and 
returned to Fort Wayne by the March 
Faculty Senate meeting. 

He also said the Joint Steering 
Committee on the Fort Wayne 
Campus will help to alleviate any 
problems of negotiating with Indiana. 

If a chancellor is not appointed by 
the designated date of July 1, 1974, it 
is possible that the Academic 
Structure plan could be implemented.

Wasted resources 



Possibly the best thing that happened to this campus in recent years 
was the construction of the Student Union. 

Some student identity seemed to emerge when the building was 
completed, and a feeling that the building really belonged to the students 
prevailed. It became the students' place of diversion away from the 
normal routine of the day. 

Much of that seems to be in jeopardy. There appears to be a massive 
waste of resources in the Student Union. Seldom does one see students 
waiting in tine to use the arts and crafts rooms. Even the television room 
does not draw students. Many students don't even know (he music- 
listening room exists. 

If it were not for the ping-pong tables and the cafeteria, the building 
would be a dull place. 

One would only hope that this is not the beginning of a trend in the 
wrong direction. 



State House bugged? 



Concerned citizens, you may be relieved lo know that the Indiana 
General Assembly has convened without many difficulties. The only 
problem brought to our attention thus far was a stuck elevator, which 
stranded some of the Fort Wayne delegates. Nobody was injured, but 
there were complaints that the elevator became full of hot air, as the local 
politicians were anxious to hear Gov. Bowen's address to both houses of 
the General Assembly. 

This session has been designated ; 
"emergency" legislation only. No one i 
"emergency" legislation, but perhaps tw 
considered may show us the light. 

Both bills revolve around something this state is deprived of, our own 
state insect. Senate Bill 8 designates the firefly as the state insect, and 
House Bill 1326 states that the Monarch Butterfly should lake the title. 
Now one may think this type of bill does not qualify as "emergency" 
legislation, but a closer look at the significance of these two bills makes it 
evident why some legislators are really being "bugged" by them. 

This is the year of re-election; every legislator is concerned about 
having his name attached to a popular bill or voting for a bill that will 
please his constituents. Imagine the honor that one achieves when he 
votes for the lampyidae bill or the danaus plexippus bill. 

There is one problem, however. Only one of the insects can win. This 
causes problems for the legislative process, but with the vast amounts of 
technology available, one would think a solution could be found. Perhaps 
cross breeding the firefly and the monarch would solve everyone's 
problems. Every legislator could vote for the bill and people could buy the 
resulting offspring as pets Having two or three big butterflies that light 
up at night would come in handy during these days of conserving energy. 
Who knows how we might benefit from this "emergency" legislation '.'

Getting your first phone installed

murder if you've never gone through

When 1 first came to San Antonio I 
decided that the one luxury I would 
afford myself was going to be a 
telephone. Simple. But if I knew what 
kind of trouble it would be I would 
have forgotten the whole thing! 

The day began when I went next 
door lo my neighbor's to call the 
phone company. 1 dialed the operator 



"Operator, I'd like to have a 
phone installed in my,.." 

"I'm sorry sir, I cannot be of 
assistance to you. Please call our 
business office." 

"Can 1 please have that num- 
ber?" 

"Call directory assistance-they 
will help you. Click!" 

1 dialed 411. 

"Directory assistance." 

"Yes, I'd like the number of the 



"You can find that number on 
page -53 of your telephone directory." 
"But I just moved in and I don't 
HAVE a directory," 

"If you call our business office 
they will deliver one - thank you. 
Click!" 

Infuriated, I made the mistake of 
dialing 411 again.

You don't have I 



By STAN JONES 

Turning the corner into a new 
year, one pauses to reflect on the old 
and to project into the new. This 
endeavor will undoubtedly be object- 
ively futile due to the acknowledged 
fact that in 1973 writers accepted the 
tenet that subjectivity and propagan- 
da had become the norm. 

Many events occurred in 1973 
both small and large, revealed and 
unheralded and yet what may have 
seemed the most important may turn 



On the world scene what may turn 
out to be the most significant events 
are the latest Mid-East war, the 
subsequent oil embargo and the 
collapse of detente. 

The war itself took a heavy toll on 
both sides. The Israelis, however, 
again displayed their intention to stay 
and talent at somehow always 
emerging on top. One positive aspect 
of the war has been that the level of 



employment for foreign service 
personnel and Biblical scholars has 
greatly increased.

Tax break for feminists' diaries 



By AUDREY GELLIS 

Life is difficult for the working 
woman, what with limited job oppor- 
tunities, low pay, the cost of child care 
(if one is a mother) plus a tax 
structure that takes a minimum of 20 
per cent of one's hard-earned wages. 

While President Nixon has failed 
to help women as far as equal 
employment, better pay, or day care 
', he has provided the 
' a move that could 
finally give women a tax break. 

Mr. Nixon donated a roomful of 
memorabilia from his vice-president- 
ial days to the National Archives, for 
which he was allowed a tax deduction 
of $576,000 which saved him $250,000 in 

The National Archives is the 
history of this country's men; it 
represents governmental, business 
and social life from which women 
were totally excluded. If a contribu- 
tion to the archives of men's history is 
lax deductible, fairness dictates that 
a similar contribution to women's 
history be treated in the same way. 

On this basis', we working 
feminists are very seriously planning 
to donate our papers to the Feminist 
Archives in Washington, D.C. claim- 
ing Mr Nixon's case as a precedent to 
tax deductions. However, women's 
history is not limited to feminist 
activity. There exists the Women's 
History Library in Berkeley, Californ- 
ia, which collects, annotates and files 
the records documenting the lives of 
women per se - whether they be Ms.

untold "herstory" for scholars, writ- 
ers and social scientists. 

Located at 2325 Oak St., Berkeley, 
California 194708), the library wel- 
comes material such as diaries, 
unpublished manuscripts, minutes of 
women's activist groups, posters and 
leaflets, newspaper clips from above- 
ground or underground, etc. 

If you want to know what your 
papers are worth, just take them to 
your local friendly appraiser and tell 
him-her what sort of tax deduction 
you want. That's how Mr. Nixon's 
lawyers did it according to one report, 
Ralph Newman, the president's 
appraiser, explained it this way: 
"They tell you want they want when 
they're going to give a gift and you 
certify it for them." Mr. Newman's 
$12,000 fee was also tax deductible.

aunt wasn't a suffragist, you don't

invitations to proms, weddings, 
christenings, church suppers, Hadas- 
sah bazaars, PTA and temperance 
meetings. 

Nor should it be assumed that 
only the papers of feminist or feminist 
sympathizers are "herstorical" docu- 
ments - women who oppose the 
major goals tsuch i 



to this tax loophole. 

There is one technicality - this 
type of deduction was repealed by 
Congress in July 1969. However, 
President Nixon donated his papers to 
the Archives on April 10, 1970. 
Recently, he received a personal note 
from the IRS district director in 
Baltimore that read, "I want to 
compliment you on the care shown in 
the preparation of your returns." 
Obviously, IRS must still be recogniz- 
ing this type of deduction. 



Only a lawyer and-or accountant 
can give you the last word on the 
adivsability of claiming a tax 



ever, the feminist attorneys to whom I 
spoke felt I had outlined a strong case 
to be presented to one's tax advisor. 
Since this loophole brought Mr. 
Nixon's taxes below $1,000 for two of 
his years as president, its extention 
could enable a secretary to pay the 



United States. 



i the president of the 



blessing. Our dependence on foreign 
energy sources has been increasing 
rapidly much to our detriment. 
Energy sources of our own have been 
lying unused and in many instances 
unknown. The crunch produced by the 
cut-off will necessitate a more 
efficient exploitation of our own 
resources and the much needed 
research into the development of new 
energy sources. 

The collapse of detente may be 
the most revealing event of 1973. 
Great scepticism has continually 
surrounded Mr. Kissinger and his 
efforts at world peace. Unlike some of 
us who express extreme caution when 
dealing with the Soviets, Mr. Kissing- 
er seems to feel that somehow if we 
treat them nice, smile, give them 
wheat and think pleasant thoughts 
that the persecution of dissadints in 
the Soviet Union will diminish, that 
the question of Jewish immigration 
will be solved, Soviet imperialism will 
cease and the United States and the 
Soviet Union will walk arm in arm to 
that great peace at the end of the 
rainbow. Well, not so. 

The events following the initial 
thrust of the Arabs against Israel has 
already shown the menagerie of 
detente to be what it is, a farce. The 
Soviets were no more interested in the 
cessation of hostilities than they were 
in Czechoslovakian freedom in 1958. 
To add to this, we hear once again the 
rumblings of what has to be the moral 
conscience of Russia, the words and 
actions of Alexandre Solzhenitsyn. 
Solzhenitsyn, more than once, has 
warned the West :iot to be deceived by 
the pleasant smiles, kind words and 
smooth rhetoric of the Soviet slave- 

With the release to the West of his 
latest indictment on the Soviet 
system, the before known fact of 



Soviet atrocities lays bare the results 
of Soviet tyranny. Indeed, the Czars 
appear as teddy bears to the present 
set-up. A conservative estimate of 20 
million deaths can be attributed to the 
calculated efforts used to subjugate 
the people of Russia to the worker's 
paradise, more truthfully though, a 
worker's "paradise lost." Henry K. 
should read Solzhenitsyn once in a 

Nationally the big news was 
Vietnam, Watergate, the economy 
and other assorted tidbits. We finally 
disengaged ourselves from Vietnam 
and ended the draft. Watergate, well, 
just about everyone seems to have 
been in on this one. I certainly hope 
we don't investigate the Democrats, 
I'd hate to see this thing drag on for 
another 3 years. With regard to the 
Ervin committee, no doubt history 
will show that the reputation of the 
late Senator McCarthy will be greatly 
improved by its performance. 

Our problems with the economy 
have been solved by the controls and 
the various phases. No longer do we 
have a tolerable inflation rate but one 
which has tripled and is still climbing. 
Fantastic! The fuel problem has 
added a new dimension to the national 
scene. Nixon has been handed by 
Congress a blank check which rather 
accurately has been described as a 
"domestic Tonkin Gulf resolution." A 
congressional about-face of some 
significance after overriding the 
President's veto on a reasonable bill 
called the War Powers Act. 

Statewide, the Governor's new 
tax package became law. Whoopee! ! 
And finally here at the school the 
controversy over the new "super" 
chancellor has reached beyond its 
grasp. An interesting point through 
all of this has been the position taken 
by the faculty that whoever is 
selected, he or she should not be 
affiliated with this school. It will be 
interesting to note if the faculty

By DONALD C. BAUDER 

Many years ago, Mark Twain 
defined a gold mine as a hole in the 
ground with a liar on the top. 

Today, an increasing number of 
influential citizens, in and out of 
Washington, describe the domestic oil 
industry in similar terms. 

Three states - Florida, Connecti- 
cut and New York - have hauled the 
major companies into court to face 
charges of illegal collusion and price 
manipulation. 

Sen. Walter Mondale. D-Minn., 
castigates the industry for "runaway 
profits," further claiming that it is 
"profiting from the energy shortage." 

Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis . Having 
"Big Oil's dirty tricks," declares, 
"The giant oil companies are display- 
ing an absolute and total contempt for 
the public" by "fueling the energy 
crisis in an effort to get higher prices 
and bigger profits." 

Sen. Vance Hartke, D-Ind., tugs 
at the heartstrings: "While Ameri- 
cans are getting ready to weather a 
winter with colder homes and fewer 
car miles, it is inconceivable that 
fellow Americans (oil companies) 
would export the nation's energy 



"Somebody bring a scrap. 



Such caterwauling leads other 



Washington officials to call for an 
"excess profits" tax on the oil 
industry. 

The question is, "What excess 
profits?" The facts are that the oil 
industry in recent years has not been 
as profitable as other industries. 

A study by First National City 
Bank of New York shows that from 
1963 to 1972, the petroleum industry's 
profits as a percentage of net worth 
were 11.8 per cent, compared to 12.2 
manufacturing 



risen dramatically - earnings for the 
third quarter were up 79 per cent, and 
for the year to date 59 per cent. 

Still, a study by the Federal 
Trade Commission shows that in the 
second quarter of 1973, the oil 
companies made 10.7 per cent on 
equity, as opposed to 14 per cent for 
all manufacturing. 

As John G. Winger of the Energy 
Economics Division of Chase Manhat- 
tan Bank points out, "For the last 
decade and a half, the net income of 
the petroleum industry has been too 
small relative to its capital needs." 

The bank points out that between 
1970 and 1985, the petroleum industry 
needs the astonishing sum of $1.35 
trillion dollars .to operate at a level 



necessary to provide the nation with 
adequate energy - or, it must average 
annual earnings growth of 18 per cent. 

And, says Winger, even in the big 
year of 1973. oil profits will fall short 
"by more than a billion dollars" of 
being adequate to cover needed 
capital expenditures. 

Further, he says, next year the 
industry will have to earn 70 per cent 
more than this year, which thus far is 
up 59 per cent! 

Recent opinion polls - such as one 
by Opinion Research - show that the 
public holds the oil industry in 
relatively low regard, and believes its 
profits are far larger than they 

Politicians are baiting an unin- 
formed public about "excess profits" 
of an underprofiable industry which 
must dramatically improve those 
profits to serve the aforementioned 

And what is the oil industry doing 
about this? Depressingly little. 

A communications specialist for 
the American Petroleum Institute 
points to the industry's inadequate 
earnings but laments, "The public

SPORTSMEN OF 1973 

It's that time of year again when everybody's picking 
the Man of the Year, Athlete of the Year, Comeback Player 
of the Year, Executive of the Year, Flop of the Century , and 



In the past month half of all sports newsprint has 
consisted of the letters "0" and "J." And one major entity 
named Secretariat "Athlete of the Year.'' Rumor has it that 
Secretariat will be sent a personally engraved Bulova 
Acutron watch which will be worn around the ankle and ten 
bundles of the best hay in the country. 

The Man of the Century Award must go to Mark Spitz. 
His comedy routines in 1973 which followed up his dynamic 
success in the 1972 Olympics will never be equaled. 

Spitz' portrayal of a drab, nauseating, conceited bore 
was well-conceived and brilliantly performed all across his 
America. The makers of Alka-Seltzer are paying King Spitz 
a fortune just to stay in his America. 

Movie giants are after the Man to play a dual role. - 
Tarzan and Jane. Science fiction movie giants are after the 
Man to play the new superhuman hero, Klodd. 

And underwater film producers see King Spitz as 
making more millions portraying Super Guppie. Only thing 
is, thr Man will have to learn how to swim again. 

Well, gee whiz Master Mark, you sure have come a long 
way since those awful days studying to be a dentist at 
Indiana University. 

Spitz certainly was not without competition for the Man 
of the Century Award. Biliie Jean Queen from Bucktooth, 
South Carolina, received considerable scrutiny as well. Her 
tear-jerking triumph in the "Battle of the Sexes" warrants 
her a second-place finish in our voting. 

Inevitably Biliie has been hounded for interviews in the 
past months. A typical one may go like this:

PISTOL PETE ARRIVES 

Last year the Atlanta Hawks of the NBA did not have 
what anybody could have possibly called a good team. As 
the losses mounted up, tempers flared and dissension 
struck. 

The Hawks were not playing as a unit, and former 
Louisiana State super-boy Peter Maravtch was given much 
of the blame. It wasn't so much that Pistol Pete was 
hogging the ball and taking all the shots, but simply that 

vowed that the 1973-74 season would be a"much better one 
for him and the Atlanta Hawks. And it looks like he is on his 
way to more than satisfying that vow. 

This year Maravich has found that he can be a 
more-than-effective team man and still tally those points.
