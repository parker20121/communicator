Volleyball team to play three matches at Coliseum 



by Jim Porter 
Sports Editor 



As community involvement grows at 
IPFW. so do the needs of the ath- 
letic teams In an effort to show- 
case the Mastodons, the department of ath- 
letics has moved three men's volleyball 
games to the Memorial Coliseum. 

The move is an attempt to make 
Mastodon athletic events a more communi- 
ty related sports and entertainment option. 

"Basically, we are moving our show 
across the street." said Bennie Lewis, direc- 
tor of promotions and marketing "When 



you gel 2,000 people in here, it is overkill. 
Concessions, apparel sales, it's all a prob- 
lem when we get that many people in the 
Gates Center " 

The first game to be played at Memorial 
Coliseum will be this Friday night. The 
Mastodons will tangle with Midwestern 
Intercollegiate Volleyball Association 
(MIVA) rival Ball State. 

"For me, it is personally satisfying to see 
the stature of our program continue to 
grow," ..".ii.li Amie Ball said. "The volley- 
hall program is sort of a flagship of where 
athletics wants to be." 

The move to Memorial Coliseum is just 
one more step in the process of campus 
growth. Ball indicated the need (or the 



entire university to enhance its image as a 
major player in the community. 

"We have been able to get corporate 
support to finance (the match)," Ball said. 
'The one important factor is thai the whole 
thing is costing the university nothing in 
terms of financing the event." 

Officials at Memorial Coliseum have 
catered to the needs of the volleyball team 
in numerous ways A new volleyball only 
court was purchased specifically for the 
matches at the Coliseum, 

Tickets for the volleyball game are 
available at all Ticket-Master outlets and 
Memorial Coliseum ticket offices Students 
will be admitted to the match free of charge 
but must have a ticket. Student tickets are 



available at the Union Operations informa- 
tion desk. Identification must be shown for 
students to pick up tickets No student tick- 
ets are available at Memorial Coliseum. 

According to Lewis the move makes 
good marketing sense. 

"We are trying to uplift our athletic pro- 
grams." Lewis said. "It makes sense to have 
our marquee sport showcased at the best 
venue in the area." 

As the athletic programs grow, the need 
for spectator- friendly venues becomes a 
necessity. 

"It is an opportunity for the players to 
play in a big arena." Ball said. "The 
Coliseum is a step up from our facility and 
provides more of a Division I atmosphere." 



Athletic department officials hope to 
draw at least 3,000 spectators to the match 
on Friday evening, 

"If the crowd at the NCAA 
Championships is any indication of the vol- 
leyball crowd we can draw, we should be 
successful," Lewis said. 

Although ticket sales at Memorial 
Coliseum have been slow, IPFW and 
Coliseum officials have indicated it is not 
unusual for spectators to buy tickets at the 
last minuie 

"It would be to our advantage to for 
once have more IPFW people there than 
our opposition brings," Lewis said.

Emile Hassan Dyer comes alive during the sound check before WorldColor's concert on Monday, 
Feb 19 the Walb Ballroom 



WorldColor entertains IPFW 



by Not Beckley 
Editor 

WorldColor entertained a sparse crowd in the Walb 
ballroom on Monday, Feb. 19. with sounds from all 
over the world. 

The band, undaunted by the minimal crowd, played 
for over an hour and never lost its contagious energy 
The Student Activities Board (SAB) brought the band 
to the university as pan of the Black History Month 
celebration. 

WorldColor's founder and flutist Pamela Whitman 
said the band had just completed a 21-day tour featur- 
ing 18 shows The sold out performances were mostly 
in New York and Pennsylvania This was the band's 
only stop in Indiana. 

Whitman founded the band in 1989 She had been 
playing flute with a storyteller when she met percus- 
sionist and vocalist Emile Hassan Dyer. Whitman said 
she had been looking a long lime for Dyer. 

Whitman also plays with the Ocean City Pops in 
New Jersey, 

Dyer grew up in Western Africa and has traveled to 
Switzerland and France with his parents. His parents 
are originally from the U.S. and spend their summer 
vacations in the States Dyer's family relumed lo ihe 
U.S. when he was a teenager. 



"I experienced some serious culture shock," Dyer 
said. 

The other band members are Nontlhebo Parkies, a 
South African vocalist; Toshi Yanagi, a Japanese gui- 
tarist; Kevin Murillo, a half Mexican and half Yaqui 
Apache drummer; Toshiakki Somuya, a Japanese 
bassist; and Dan Bahimo Rcy. a half Mexican and half 
Isleta Pueblo vocalist and percussionist. 

"We all bring in our own style." Dyer said. 

Some of the influences the band cited were fusion 
jazz, la Scala. Brazilian and Lalin rhythms The band 
members play a variety of instruments from around the 
world Whitman plays a Lakota fluie or oreharina, 
which according to Lakota tradition, only men are 
allowed to play. She passed the tribal test, however, 
and was taught bow io play (he flute 

According to Whitman. Ihe band has undergone sev- 
eral personnel changes and is constantly evolving. This 
was Somuya' s first tour with the band. 

They ended their show with a song which appears 
on their album which was being sold by SAB. 
According to the chorus, "There are many happy peo- 
ple/Black and while and yellow and red too/Children 
from around the world/All of us from a common 
thread." Another song which animated the otherwise 
lifeless audience was called "Kilaminjaro " Dyer 
described the song as "heavy." 



Indiana U. to offer Internet courses 



by Cassfc R liter 
Staff Reporter 

Students at IPFW will soon be able to enroll 
in a class offered on the Internet in January of 
1997 Now, the class is offering three credits lo 
Indiana University. Bloomington siudenls. 

Kathleen Gilbert professor of family studies 
at Indiana University, teaches the 300-level 
class, "Grief in a Family Context." This is the 
firsi class of its kind to be offered lo l.U. stu- 
dents via ihe Internet," Gilbert said. "The class 
allows students to interact with people from all 
over the world " According to Gilbert, she has a 
few studenLs from Canada. Hawaii and Israel 



who have enrolled as I U. students in order to 
lake the class. 

The class is structured inio a 16-week semes- 
ter, with a different topic relating io grief each 
week. Some of the topics include; dealing with 
grief as a child and then as an adult; the role of 
gender in coping with grief; and Ihe significance 
of grief for parents with disabled children "1 
want students to be aware of ihe significance of 
grief--how it can change ones life and how to 
deal with it" Gilbert said. 

The only interaction in the class is via the 
computer Students receive their assignments on 
the Nei and send their work direcily to the pro- 
fessor's e-mail address Students are noi 



required to meet the professor or other sludents 
enrolled in the class 

Sludents can have private discussions and 
interact with others through a private e-mail dis- 
cussion list "It's important in a class such as 
this that siudenls are assured privacy from per- 
sonal matters such as gnef." Gilbert said. 

According lo Professor Gilbert, students will 
benefit from taking ihe class on the Internet 
because they will gain broad exposure to other 
cultures and ihe experiences others have had 
with grief. Guest lecturers and therapists will 
make occasional appearances in ihe Iniemei 
class, offering advice and answering questions 
from studenLs

sessions. Smith refers them out to 
other counselors in the area. 

"I work real hard to find [coun- 
selors] who fit with Ihe sludents." 
Smith said. 

One factor Smith lakes into 
account when making referrals is 
cost Smith supports what he calls 
"reasonable cosi therapy." This 
simply means that students who 
need Ihe service will be able to 
obtain it at a manageable cost. 
Many counselors charge nearly one 
hundred dollars an hour. As a 
member of the mental health com- 
munity, Smith knows which insur- 
ance companies will pick up fees 
from which counselors, as well as 
those counselors who work on a 
sliding scale for college students

Good ol' post office 
does it again 



To Ihe ediior; 

CHEERS to the U.S. Postal 
Service. 

For the past twenty-three years, I 
had a post office box. Then last 
summer when 1 was out of town, I 
missed Ihe notice they gave me say- 
ing the box rental was due July 1. 
The one noiiee. No follow up. No 
second notice. No reminder. 
Nothing, Seven days aficr the due 
date my bo* was history Gone. 
Rented lo someone else That was 
wonderful enough but their 
thoughifulncss got even better, 
They sent all my mail back to the 
senders. Sure, what else would you 
expect for twenty-three years of 
being a faithful customer? Note 1 
said MY mail, mail that was 
addressed to me. not the post office. 
Thanks to the posi office, I will 
never know what mail I missed. 



And I truly enjoy the expense and 
hassle of changing all my business 
cards and stationery. Where else 
would a business go this extra step? 
Maybe I am somebody special. 

I wrote the boss — the post- 
mistress — to express my apprecia- 
tion, to no response. I wrote Ihe 
Consumer Advocate in 
Washington, D.C., lo no response. 
They both probably got lost in the 
mail. Such sensitivity and under- 
standing is just what made ibis 
country great These values are 
what destroyed an entire native 
population without so much as a 
word of apology and what prompts 
the government to drop poison on 
its own people, as it did here with 
zinc cadmium sulfide. I could goon 
and on but I'M end with a simple 
THANK YOU

Dole's not old, but he is old-fashioned 



Age should never be an issue, especially 
when it comes to hiring But in the case of (he 
presidency, Bob Dole has proved to be too old 
for the job Dole's age seems unimportant when 
you learn he is more athletic, more energetic and 
healthier than most men ten years his junior. 
Physically he may be the best candidate, but 
orally, he still needs a workout. 

It's not his actual age of 72 that bothers us, 
it's the old-fashioned values that come with it. 
His ideas for reworking this country are out- 
dated and do not represent the needs of the 
United Stales loday. Not that we really know 
what bis views are During this time of heavy 
campaigning, Dole has decided to hide from the 
media that the other Republican candidates are 



embracing We think it is because he simply 
docs not have anything new to say. 

If Dole wants to be president (which is 
unlikely because most nominations go to those 
who win the New Hampshire primary, and he 
didn't), be should quickly learn the concerns of 
America, adapt bis agenda to meet the citizens' 
needs and discuss the issues accordingly 

The other candidates vying for the 
Republican nomination should not be bard to 
beat: Steve Forbes is a plastic message recycler; 
Pat Buchanan does not undersiand diversity; 
Dick Lugar is too out of touch; and Lamar who? 
(Wasn't that Ihe name of ihe black gay in 
"Revenge of the Nerds"?) Alan Keyes is the 
only exciting candidate, but without money or a

high military ranking, the United Stales won't 
nominate an African -American So Dole should 
have a clear victory 

Bob Dole has wanted lo be president for a 
long time. It's too bad his stalled ideals will pre- 
vent his dream from ever coming true His 
recent loss to Pat Buchanan in the New 
Hampshire primary may lake a lot oul of him, If 
Dole warns to help his party regain the White 
House, he should bow out gracefully, support 
the increasingly popular Buchanan and finish his 
years as an active senate leader. 

But he shouldn't retire from politics altogeth- 
er His congressional pension and social security 
may not be enough to live on. 



Morals have become passe 




S. Brant 
.Kelley 



Popular in today's culture is the 
idea that an absolute system of 
morals doesn't belong in our soci- 
ety. Unpopular, then, is the idea 
that any such single sysiem can suit 
the social and philosophical (not to 
mention the moral) needs of today's 
society. 

History is a great teacher to 
those willing to lcam. Great soci- 
eties have preceded modern 
Western culture and have crashed 
and burned not because (he techno- 
logical or civil structure broke 
down, but because the people in 
those societies no longer paid atten- 
tion to their moral compass 

The Victorian era in England 
(1837-1900) was a lime of Britain's 
greatest extent as a world power 
The United Kingdom forgot God 
and soon after forgot its moral 
underpinnings Where is the might 
of the UK today? It is in such a 
state that the British and all of the 



of Western 
Furope still depend- 
ed upon the United 
Slates' presence to 
deter Eastern bloc 
expansion during 
the cold war. 

Modem and post- 
modern intelli- 
gentsia wail and 
bemoan America's 
social ills and con- 
tinually look to the 
government for solutions. Uncle 
Sam has been rehashing crime, 
urban violence, illegal drugs and 
teenage pregnancies for the past 
three-plus decades and what has ihe 
result been? More crime (a 560 per- 
cent jump since the 1960s), more 
urban violence (Fort Wayne's 
homicide rate has doubled in the 
last four years), more illegal drug 
use and more teenage pregnancies. 
The public sector is now broke (a 
55 trillion debt) and if our not-so- 
rich uncle is to continue taking care 
of the problems, he will need to 
become Big Brother (o do it. 

It is no coincidence that many of 
these base social trends began when 
the authorities demoralized our cul- 
ture If our students were no longer 
allowed to read the Bible, what 
would be the basis for the students' 
belief systems? No one thing took 
its place. Now nothing tells them 
stealing is intrinsically wrong.

With the absence of a firm moral fering and the aged. Look at Jack 

standard began ihe presence of free Kavorkian; or worse, look at the 



love, personal, divergent moral sys- 
tems, a rise in drug use and a jump 
in the number of illegitimate births. 
Now with free love come venereal 
diseases, includ- 
ing AIDS, and 

with divergent 
moral systems 
comes the ability

years of Germany without "moral 
shackles " It isn't a German prob- 
lem; Hitlers have occurred else- 
where with equally disastrous 
results

Erie 

Ledbetier 



As (he rhetonc of Ihe 1996 
presidential primary election 
beats up, many are listening to 
the rantings of Pat Buchanan 
and wondering if they are an 
"Us" or a "Them," With this 
in mind, I have compiled a list 
of "Thems" for the average 
IPFW student. If you belong 
to any group on this list, may I suggest thai 
you consider voting for someone else. 
Without further ado, here is the most cur- 
rent index of the people Mr Buchanan 
believes is "taking away bis culture": 
"Welfare moms and their children 
"African Americana 
"Gays &amp; Lesbians 

' People with 1 3 ilems in the express lane 
■ Socialists &amp; Communists 
' Non-Chrlsllans 

* Artists 

* People with AIDS/HIV 

* Trekkies (The Federation is 

an obvious communist ploi designed 
to subvert ihe U.S. Constitution, similar 
to the U.N.) 

' Jane Fonda, before she was reformed 

' Hillary, Bill. Chelsea and Socks the cat 

" People who don't pray 

' People who pray with their eyes open 

* People who cite that pesky little First 
Amendment 




' Liberals 

' People who ignore Rush's advice and 

watch the news anyway 
' Pro-choeers 

* People who eat at un-American restau- 
rants like Taco Bell 

* People who drive Mazdas 

' People who have traveled outside 

the U.S. and had a good time 
' Immigrants &amp; foreigners in general 
' People who criticize Joe McCarthy 
' People with six toes 
' People who don't raise their right 

hand when they meet him 

* Anita Hill and anyone who believed her 

* Women who work outside the home 
' Women who don't need a husband 

* Men who do 

' People who know or associate with 
other people on this list 
If you fall into more than five of these 
categories, don't visit New Hampshire any 
time soon. If you are one of the 12 people 
who is not destroying ihe American cul- 
ture, call 1-800-GO-PAT-GO

Exhume Atwater now! 



No 
Beckley 




Reium with me to those thrilling 
days of yesteryear when the late 
Lee Atwater won the presidency for 
George "Macho Man" Bush 

Every four years. I wail wiib 
baited breaih as America runs its 
equivalent of a "mosi popular kid in 
school" contest in Iowa and New 
Hampshire. This year, I am some- 
what disappointed at the level of 
rhetoric issued by the Republican 
candidates. These milk loasty polit- 
ical veterans have souls! Take me 
back 10 ihe days when Willie 
Honon ads flooded the airwaves or 
when Mike Dukakis drove a tank. 
A Greek in a tank going forward. 
go figure 

Although Bob Dole can be a 
ruthless politician, he has not even 
begun to lake ihe primary discourse 
10 Ihe lowest level. Everyone pissed 
and moaned about how ugly the 
campaign was in Iowa, but was it 
really? Maybe we have become 
weenies because we cannot hack it. 
Our forefathers relished a dirty 
election and we cannot even stom- 
ach the slightest bit of attack ads. 

In the campaign of one of our 
greatest presidents Abraham 
Lincoln, race-mixing fears were 
played upon In our century, 
'Tailgunncr" Joe McCarthy implied 
that Dwight Eisenhower was a 
communist sympathizer After Ihe 
election of Thomas Jefferson, Vice- 
President Aaron Burr killed 
Alexander Hamilton. These were 
ugly events in our history and the 
people of the time expressed their 
anger. In the McCarthy era the pub- 
he was too afraid to rage against the 
ultra- righteousness of McCarthy 

Today, the candidates are bitch- 
ing about other candidates distort- 
ing their record. Since when are the 
issues ai stake? I was under the 
impression that ihe candidate who 
wraps himself tightest in the 
American flag wins. George Bush 
was not incredible and was not even 
Ibe bcsl candidate in his campaign 
against Dukakis. ...on second 
thought, Bush probably would have 
wiped ihe floor wiih Dukakis even 
if ol' George would have draped 
himself in Ihe Communist flag. 

In this year's campaign, only 
Alan Kcycs and Pat Buchanan have 
shown any desire lo become the 
chief executive. Both have the fire 
in their bellies and the venom on 



their tongues. 
Dole seems 
dull and list- 
less He seems 
to be running 
only because it 
is ihe crusty 
ol' curmud- 
geon turn to 
get the nomi- 
nation When 
horses get that 
old. aren't they 
shot or used to 
make glue. No 
offense meant to horses. 

Sieve Forbes has no business in 
the political arena — he needs to be 
more like the heir lo the Dupont 
fortune, but without ihe arsenal or 
the wresilers Lamar Alexander 
sums it up with his campaign slo- 
gan — LAMAR! Lugar, with all his 



poise cannot pass muster at the 
national level 

I would like to make a wish list 
of Republicans I would like to see 
run for the presidency Jack Kemp 
would make an excellent president 
if he ran in the next election If he 
wails until 2004. he will be nearly 
as old as Dole Ronald Reagan 
could run — he doesn't remember he 
has already been president twice. 
He probably thought it was one 
long movie shoot. Realistically, the 
man I would have liked to see run 
more than anyone is Colin Powell, 
at least be is a strong leader without 
too much baggage But until then, I 
am rooting for Buchanan and Keyes 
lo sweep into ihe White House in 
November — bey it could happen! 



I remember the first lime I heard that in 
certain Asian cultures new-bom girls were 
sometimes drowned because Iherc was a 
preference for boys. Or lhai parents would 
discard a new-bom because iheir family 
already had the legal maximum number of 
children. I wondered how a parent, regard- 
less of the circum stances, could ever be so 
cruel to a child, especially his or her own. 
As an adopted person. I understand why a 
parent would give a child away: usually it 
is for reasons benefiting lhat child But lo 
kill a child for one's own gain is beyond 
my understanding. 

The same goes for a grown child who is 
tossed aside because of his or her sexuality 
Last semester I told you a story about 
"Jeff." a gay who 
was rejected by his 
parents and some 
friends when he came 
out of the closet. 
(You may be interest- 
ed to know that Jeff 
has come to lerms 
wiih Ihe absence of 
his family and has 
created a life and 
future wiih which he 
is happy.) Now I 
have a new, even 
more disturbing story 
about a gay being 
abandoned 

"Darin" always 
knew he was gay. At 



a young age. he was caught 
trying on his mother's cloth- 
ing. His parenls started the 
denial which many parents use 
as a disguise lo conceal the 
trulh from disapproving fami- 
ly and friends. Ai seventeen, 
his parents found love-letters 
written to a male high-school 
companion, and they evicted 
bim from their farm. He 
moved lo Chicago lo find a 
place in the openly gay district 
known as Boy's Town, a place 
that looks great from afar, but 
never lives up to its reputation His life 
never got bet tcr. 

For those few who don'l know, living in 
a big city and working in the bar scene is a 
hard life. Darin found the people to be hol- 
low and fake and untrue Although his life 
seemed glamorous, he longed for solidarity 
and normality. Those who said they were 
friends weren't really, and those in whom 
he invested his feelings betrayed bim at 
the slightest inconvenience After four 
years, he decided to move back to his 
hometown area lo make peace with his 
family and gel back on irack. This meant 
furthering his education and finding work 
that was more fulfdling and less dangerous 
than working in a bar. He would be disap- 
pointed quickly. 

At first, his parenLs accepted him Bui it 
was only days before he was asked to 
leave, His sister took him in, only to 
change her mind nearly as quickly as his 
parenis did. Pressures from a nearby 
church and the anxieties of having a gay 
relative were too much for them Bui Darin 
had no job. no home, little money and noi 
one friend who could really help him. 
What could he do? 

It is sad for me to say, bul Ihis scenario 
is all to common. With Jeff, be was already 
independent, employed and living a life 
outside of his parents lives. Not so with 
Darin. He made an honest attempt to 
reclaim his life. All he was asking for was 
a chance to make his doubters proud. Not 



even his family was willing to give him the 
slightest push we all need when establish- 
ing ourselves. Maybe it is because both 
Darin and Jeff had siblings thai iheir par- 
ents fell they could spare a child. In any 
case, they were wrong. 

Families are mean! to be supportive of 
Iheir members. "If you can't count on your 
family, then who can you count on"? If all 
you've ever had was a family, and lhat is 
taken away, then why exisl? Luckily, for 
all ihose who have met Jeff, and those who 
will meei Darin. Ihcy are still with us. 
These are both quality people I would 
argue that almost everyone is a quality per- 
son ll is important lhat we tell these people 
tbal they matter lo us, if not their family. 

What has happened 10 Ibis world when 
people we've known all our lives suddenly 
do not matter; when loving someone could 
mean losing your core being- your family? 
Dann did not commit some heinous crime. 
He did not murder someone. He did not 
steal hard-earned money from innocent 
people He merely was born with an 
uncontrollable desire lo love. If that's a 
heinous crime, then I'm afraid we are all 
guilty 

Maybe Darin's family will one day 
come around to see the mistake they've 
made Maybe they will see they terminated 
a relationship with a talented, caring indi- 
vidual. But it may end up being too late. 
Jeff has made such a peace with Ihe 
absence of his family that he may never 
forgive them for whai they've done and 
would probably not accept an apology. 
Darin may find life to be less stressful, 
demanding or restricting without his fami- 
ly, loo. 

Life and love are too important to dis- 
card the Darins and the Jeffs of the world. 
Or the Amandas. Or the Nols Or the Jims 
Or the Erics Or the Saras. Or even the 
Steves. We arc talking about real people 
who have real feelings and the abilities to 
accomplish great things. All Ihey need is a 
chance. Everyone deserves a chance at 
least once.

'Equus' to challenge audience 



by Amanda Man ton 
Features Editor 

Purdue-Indiana Theatre presents 
"Equus" by Peter Shaffer, Feb. 23- 
24 and March 1-2 at 8 p.m. in 
Williams Theatre. Marcia D. Hepps. 
assistant professor of theatre, directs 
ibe performance. 

"Equus" is a psychological mys- 
tery concerning a boy who has 
blinded Six horses arid a psychiatrist 
who must untangle the puzzle and 
alleviate the boy's pain. This beauti- 
fully realized drama of sensitive per- 
ceptions is one of the most exciting 
and visually arresting contemporary 
plays — a compelling and deeply 
moving evening in the theatre that 
confronts the drives that lead human 
beings to crucify themselves. This 
show will contain full nudity. 

"The show is a thriller because it 
plays like a mystery that asks not 
who did it, but why," Hepps said. 

Shaffer's play is sure lo challenge 
us audience On Feb. 19, C,T. 
Gioanakaris, professor of English 
and theatre at Western Michigan 
University and scholar on the 
Shaffer's work gave a lecture in con- 
junction with PITs upcoming open- 
ing of "Equus." 

"The ideas are very challenging. 
They challenge the audience's 
beliefs in God and challenge it to 
look at the emphasis we put on the 
normal versus individuality," Hepps 
said. 

This production will feature 
invited community guest artist Chris 
Colcord in the role of Martin Dysan. 
Colcord is a veteran at PIT. He por- 
trayed the role of Mercutio in 



"Romeo and Juliet" last spring. 
Colcord played in "Tennessee" in 
1991; "Speed the Plow," 1990; and 
"The Normal Heart," 1986 at PIT. 
Colcord earned three Anthony 
Awards for his performances in 
Civic Theatre productions "All the 
King's Men," "Carnival" and "To 
Kill a Mockingbird " 

The cast also includes Ryan 
Berskes as the character Alan 
Strang. Judy McGroarty as the 
nurse. Nancy Kartholl as Hester 
Salomon. Heath Hays as Frank 
Strag. Jennifer Rapp-Parkerson as 
Kora Strang. Walter Kyles as Jill 
Mason, and Philip Snodderly, 
Joshua Richey. Elizabeth Wager. 



Gary Reed and Sue Winners as 
Horses. 

Hepps studied acting, voice and 
movement at the Royal Academy of 
Dramatic Art in London, England. 
Last year, Hepps directed "Romeo 
and Juliet" and before that "U.S.A."

The candidates. ..the issues 



Abortion 

"An unborn child is a creature of God. He's got the 
same right to life as you and I." Pat Buchanan, Jan. 6, 
1996. 

"My view as a Republican candidate is this 
shouldn't be a dominant issue in tbe Republican nomi- 
nation or the campaign for president in 1996," Bob 
Dole, Dec 17,1995. 

"1 believe that abortion is wrong and thai slates 
may resirict abortion, I would characterize my beliefs 
as pro-life." Lamar Alexander, Project Vote Smart. 

"I think lhai leaving the decision lo the woman and 
her doctor, and whoever else she wishes to consult I 
think on balance is still the right decision in our coun- 
try. " BUI Clinton, Aug. 11, 1995. 

"A federal constitutional amendment to protect 
from conception must remain our ultimate goal." Bob 
Dornan, Dec. 22, 1995. 

"In short, to change the law, we have to change the 
culture. To change the culture, we change the law little 
by liillc. If we bring public opinion along in a 
Lincolnesque way," Steve Forbes, Jan. 21, 1996. 

"The paradigm of all peace and security should be 
the peace of the unborn child in the womb," Alan 
Keyes, Position Paper. 



Budget 



"1 have always said that balancing the budget is my 
first priority, but we can balance the budget and cut 
taxes too." Dole, May 27, 1995. 

"As governor, I balanced our state budget for eight 
years and when I left office. Tennessee had fewer state 
employees, less debt, an AAA bond rating, and the 
nations fifth lowest tax rate," Alexander, Jan 15. 
1996, 

"Now, it is tune to finish the job and balance tbe 
budget," Clinton, Jan 23. 1996 

"Concerning a balanced budget amendment, I have 
to say that I want one that bas a lax cut element in it." 
Forb*s, Jan. 13. 1996. 

"I do support the balanced budget amendment, but 
I support it in ihe form promised in the Contract [with 
America)," Keyes, Position Paper. 

"Whal we need is a balanced budget, no phony 
numbers and cut ihe taxes on America's middle class. 
That's what Republicans were elected to do," 
Buchanan, Jan 6. 1996. 

Environment 

"I will not compromise any clean water, any clean 
air and protection against toxic waste. The environ- 
ment cannoi protect itself. And if it requires a presi- 



dential veto to protect it, then that's whal I'll provide," 
Clinton, April 7, 1995 

"We all warn to see the bald eagle and the grizzly 
bear survive. But under current law, unelecied bureau- 
crais can declare a rat or a bird or an insect endan- 
gered and then an unelected judge can shut down eco- 
nomic activity on millions of acres of land," 
Buchanan. May 23. 1995. 

"Obviously, everyone wants to protect human 
health, safety and the environment. But the 'strongest' 
laws do not always mean the most costly laws Is it 
too much lo ask that we fulfill those responsibilities in 
a way that minimizes costs to society?" Dole, March 
5. 1995. 

Financial Aid 

"Despite ihe Chicken LilUe rhetoric coming from 
the While House and from ihe Democrats in Congress. 
student loans are more readily available loday lhan 
ever before in our history ." Alexander. Alexander For 
President. 

"We really have lo have more provisions for schol- 
arship aid and for assistance to the students, and more 
lax relief for iheir families so they can pay for ii. Ail 
of us, at every level of government and in the private 
sector will have to deal with this: this is not simply a 
federal government program alone " Richard Lugur. 



Jan. 13. 1996. 

"1 believe that if ihere are scholarships at the feder- 
al level il should be for science and math and physics 
and chemistry, subjects that young people generally 
need some help and encouragement to go into. But I 
don't want to subsidize at federal tax dollars Ihosc 
who arc in theater arts, as much as I like ihe theater," 
Dornan. Jan 13, 1996. 

Internet and Telecommunication 

"I call on congress to pass the requirement for a V- 
chip in TV sets so that parents can screen out pro- 
grams they believe are inappropriate for their children 
When parents control what their young children see. 
that is not censorship; that is enabling parents lo 
assume more personal responsibility for their chil- 
dren's upbringing," Clinton, Jan 23, 1996. 

"The real solution to the problem of television's 
conosive impact on our culture lies with concerned 
parents, informed consumers who have the good sense 
to turn off the trash, and corporate executives withui 
the entertainment industry who are willing to put com- 
mon decency above corporate profits," Dole, June 13, 
1996.

Colts need more 
than a quick fix 




Remember the days not loo long 
ago when the acronym Tor Colls was 
Couni On Losing This Sunday? 
Well those days are about lo reiurn 
10 Indianapolis if ihc Colls don't 
stop their bungling ways and realize 
how they achieved success last sea- 
son. 

Let's start out by doing the 
coaching math on the Indianapolis 
sideline. Three coaching positions 
minus Head Coach Ted 
Marchibroda and Defensive 
Coordinator Vince Tobin equals 
nothing. The Colls are now left 
with Lindy Infante who was out of 
fooiball for three years due 10 
burnout. Now there is a coaching 
candidate who is reliable enough to 
build a franchise. When Infante is 
officially made the Colls" choice for 
head coach, who will be left as 
assistant coaches? The only quality 
coach lo hire is former Browns 
coach Bill Bclichick. and he is 
going to work for Bill Parcclls and 
the Patriots. 

For the sake of argument, 
though, let's say the Colls do get 
their coaching situation straightened 
out. They are considering not 
resigning quarterback Jim 
Harbaugh, fullback Roosevelt Potts. 
offensive lineman Will Wolford and 
linebacker Quinten Coryott. 
Harbaugh, Wolford and Coryott 
were not only Pro-Bowlers but also 
were the cornerstones of the fran- 
chise. As close as the Colts Were to 
the Super Bowl, would it be worth 
rebuilding the entire team? 

If the Colts continue to make 
these illogical personnel decisions, 
they may end up losing more play- 
ers who feel abandoned. How well 
do you think Marshall Faulk would 
respond to losing his starting quar- 
terback and two key blockers. As 
Colts fans, we would be devastaicd 
io see another superstar force a 
trade, bnnging back bad memories 
ofJohnElway. And the boitom line 
to that story is that 27 quarterbacks 
later the Colts found a decent player

the team have 
lo go through 
to find another 
Faulk? 

For the 
Colts to remain 
i?&lt;*#£ successful. 

they need not 
only to retain 
these key play- 
ers but also to 
add more pieces to their puzzle 
through this year's draft. The team 
cannot a/ford to draft average play- 
ers like Trev Alberts and Sean 
Dawkins anymore. They need more 
impact players like last year's num- 
ber one draft pick Ellis Johnson. 
The Colts have the Falcons first- 
round pick, which falls in the mid- 
dle of the round, and could find a 
player there like UCLA offensive 
tackle Jonaihon Ogden or Florida 
wide recievcr Chris Doering. Both 
players would be of great assistance 
in solidifying the team's offense 
Ogden would be an especially great 
addition if the team loses Woiford. 

For the Colts, though, the organi- 
zation ought to chose its path wisely 
and soon. If players start to feel 
ihey are being snubbed by the team 
like Marchibroda was, they may 
leave anyway. After countless sea- 
sons of watching the Colls lose mis- 
erably, I am not ready to see the 
team struggle again. Without a 
capable quarterback and players 
who want to play for the team let's 
face it, the Colts would be nothing 
more than the Jets,

streak- the sec-

its kind in 
school history. 
The Mas tod i ins 
have not won a 
game since 
their come- 
from-behind victory over Kentucky 
WesleyanonJan. 11. 

With four games remaining, all 
against teams the 'Dons have not 
been able to beat this season, it 
seems likely the streak could stretch 



Three losing seasons and a lack 
of control seem to have claimed the 
best of men's basketball coach 
Andy Piazza. After guiding the 
Mastodons to successive 20-win 
seasons in 19 u 2 and 1993. the team 
has failed to post more than 10 wins to 14 games by the end of the sea- 
in each of the past three years. This son. The team is falling apart and

Center 1 he pressures of losing 
reached a boiling point, and the 
coach's anger was unleashed on 
officials at the scorer's table. It was 
not a pretty sight 

A mistake was made involving 
the number of personal fouls 
charged to guard Kyle Kirby At

gust and disbelief with the situation 
in no uncertain terms 

While the error was acknowl- 
edged by everyone - including the 
official scorer- the rules of the 
game stipulate that no changes can 
be made to official statistics once in 
the book. 

With just under five minuies 
remaining in tbe game, Piazza's 
wrath reached a fever pitch Kirby, 
the Dons leading scorer, fouled out 
of the contest. Piazza jumped from 
his court-side seat and again 
demonstrated his frustration It was 
a direct and personal attack aimed 
at the official scorer- an 1PFW stu-

could cost us the game and mi my 
career.'" shouted Piazza. 

The score keeper's error was noi 
the ultimate demise ot the 'Dons. 
Inconsistency and a loss of focus 
decided the game Unfocused and 
inconsistent play have plagued the 
Dons all season 

As for the coach, bis outburst 
may be the result of so much frus- 
tration built up over a long, losing 
season. It is not the first time a 
tongue lashing by the coach has 
been directed at someone on press 
row The events of Saturday night 
only prove that there is a need for a 
change in the system. 

The pressure of the job gets to 
every coach at one time or another, 
especially when his team cannot 
seem to win There comes a time, 
however, when changes need to be 
made for the good of the program 
and the coach. Although a great 
number of coaches have been dis- 
missed for circumstances beyond 
their control, it is clear that coach 
Piazza does not fit that mold. 

Three consecutive losing seasons 
and a current 10-game losing streak 
may have caught up with Piazza. 
and perhaps the time has come for 
the coach and the school to part 
ways The handwriting has been on 
the wall for a while now. That it has 
become more clear to a number of 
people only proves there is a need 
for dismissal in this case. 

Piazza's actions reek of frustra- 
tion and the need for brighter pas- 
tures for the coach and tbe men's 
basketball program It is time to 
wish Andy a beany, "ciao coach." 



Post-season 
within reach 
of Lady Dons 



by Jim Porter 
Sports Editor 

A 20-3 record has the 
women's basketball team poised 
to make a trip to post-season play. 
It would be the first time the 
women's team has competed in 
the NCAA Division II Regional 
The men's team made a trip to the 
"dance" in 1992. 

For coach Pam Bowden's team 
to be extended a bid to the tourna- 
ment, it must finish among the 
top six teams in the Great Lakes 
Region rankings. Currently, the 
Mastodons are tied for second in 
die region 

"We are hoping we can finish 
in the second spot," Bowden said 
"One and two get byes so that 
would give us a chance to get a 
look at the Michigan teams." 

Oakland College, Lake 
Superior Slate and Northern 
Michigan arc all three ranked in 
the top six. Bowden and her team 
have not faced any of the three, 
and (he prospects of scouting 
them are slim. 

"They are good teams and the 
GLIAC is a tough, physical con- 
ference," Bowden said. "I would 
much rather play two games and 
have the chance to watch them." 

According to Bowden. the (ate 
of the 'Dons is in the hands of the 



players. With two weeks remain- 
ing in the season four wins would 
almost certainly solidify the 
Mastodon's claim to the number 
two spot in the region 

"I think we can run the table." 
Bowden said. "But we have to be 
there defensively and with 
rebounding If we play like we 
did Saturday night, we have a 
great opportunity " 

The best possible scenario for 
the Mastodons may be the oppor- 
tunity to host the regional tourna- 
ment at the Gates Sports Center 

"Geographically, we are in the 
best location," said Bowden. 
"Bellartnine is south and the 
Michigan schools are all in the 
UP (upper peninsula of 
Michigan). I think thai is our best 
bet." Bowden said. 

There are eight regional tour- 
naments around the country. The 
winner at each of Ihose sites 
advances to the "Elite Eight," the 
Division II version of the "Final 
Four." 

The location of this year's 
"Elite Eight" tournament has yel 
to be determined Bids are taken 
by the NCAA from the eight 
teams advancing in the tourna- 
ment. 

"Most likely it will be at North 
Dakota State," Bowden said
