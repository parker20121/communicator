Editorial 



A Purge? Who's Next? 

by Hal Myers 
Under the guise of "upgrading:" the Department of 
Sociology. Prof. Joel Horowitz will not be rehired at lU-PU 
for the academic year 1970-71. This dismissal seems, on 
the surface, to be a routine administrative decision. There 
are several discrepancies, however, which have come to 
the attention of some members of the academic community 
which malte the bureaucratic "impartiality" of this decision 
questionable. Among them: 

1. The policy under which Prof. Horowitz was dis- 
missed has been inconsistently applied. A lecturer is appointed 
for a on&amp;-year term with an optional, second one-year ap- 
pointment. A third appointment is 

, . , dependent upon whether 1. requirements for the 
terminal degi-ce are met during 1969-70, or 2. the 
Dean and departmental chairman recommend an ad- 
ditional appointment. 

Nert year would be Prof. Horowitz' third appointment ; 
another member of the department has been offered his 
fourth appointment, even though, it would seem, that, 
under thig rule, he should be the first to go if the adminis- 
tration's desire is to replace one of the lecturers \vith a 
"terminally qualified" professor (a PhD.). 

2. At. least one student loiew about the decision one 
month before Prof. Horowitz had been infomied by the 
Dean — she is the wife of a local politician, and she had 
expressed her resentment of and violent disagreement with 
Prof Horowitz' political position on numerous occasions. 

3. In an interview with Dean Johnson, durine which 
a witness was not allowed to be present. Prof, Horowitz 
was given other reasons (i.e., in addition to the policy 
cited in 1. above) for his dismissal, none of which the 
Dean will admit having said. Included in these reasons 
wan a statement by the Dean to the effect that Horowiti 
hai somehow failed as a teacher. This statement by the Dean 
stands in sharp contrast to the opinions of the majority 
of Prof, Horowitz" students, a) During registration, Prof. 
Horowitz' sections are filled early, due. in part, to the 
larjje number of students who, having taken one course from 
him. desire to talte another, b) Responses on the Student 
Evaluation questionnaire are contrary to the Dean's views. 

If this dismissal resulted from a personality conflict 
between Prof. Horowitz and his departmental chairman 
(for which there is at least circumstantial evidence) or if 
this dismissal is ex post facto political censorship of an ont- 
apoken and controversial faculty member, then either reason 
is a breach of bureaucratic impartiality and a THREAT TO 
ACADEMIC FREEDOM AT INDIANA-PURDUE. In view 
of the above evidence, it is felt that this dismissal stems 
from reasons other than those given officially or by the 
Dean in private. 

UNLESS SUBSTANTIAL REASONS ARE GIVEN 
TO JUSTIFY THIS DISMISSAL, WE DEMAND THAT 
PROF. HOROWITZ BE REINSTATED. 



THE COMMUNICATOR 

Like A Cancer Grows . . . 
Sandbox Student Government 

A spectre haunts Indiana-Purdue University at Fort 
\Vaj'ne: sandlw.'c student government. This has been the 
historical tendency of the elected representatives of the 
students to engage in childish and immature endeavoi-s at 
the expense of those they are supposed to serve. It is a 
sickness, a disease that stalks everyone in positions or re- 
sponsibility. Like a cancer, if once allowed to gain a foot- 
hold, it will spread, destroying every part of the organism 
is touches until finally life itself perishes. In the past the 
student goveraments of our campus have been, the unfortun- 
ate victims of this disease. Only recently have such de- 
structive tendencies been purged from student leadership 
and for this reason resistance to the cancer of sandbox 
student government remains extremely low. 

The present members of student government established 
and have courageously maintained a commitment to fight 
the subversive efforts of sandbox student government to 
regain its erst-while position of dominance. Unfortunately, 
as so often happens, the doctor too has contracted the 
disease. 

A am referring specifically to the recent attempts by 
the right wing, liberal, and pseudo-radical members of stu- 
dent .government to conduct a campaign to elect me Mid- 
Winter Carnival Queen. The fact that I am a male and that 
the ciimpaign was launched without my consent and against 
my will is not the issue. What concerns me and what I hope 
will concern the student body is the fact that this activity 
represents to mature student government and the interests 
of the students. 

As our campus grows and with it is the accompanying 
insensitive and exploitive administrative bureaucracy there 
is a corresponding increase in the crucial need for a re- 
sponsible, mature, and healthy student government. The im- 
pending return to the sandbox by student government mani- 
fested by the Queen campaign, though semingly harmless, 
represents the greatest threat to the interests and well- 
being of the students at this campus since the tuition increase. 

The ultimate justice, of course, lies with the people. 
Given the nature of the disease of sandbox student govern- 
ment it is the responsibility of you, the students, to guard 
against its return. Your course of action should be clear. 
If student government continues to pursue such infantile 
activities as the Queen campaign, I call upon you to e.^ercise 
your franchise and unseat the entire lot in the upcoming 
elections. 

Do not underestimate the significance of this threat. 
While your representatives are working to elect me Queen 
of the Mid-Winter Carnival the administrative bureaucrats 
and their puppets are conspiring to impose upon you a 
system of paid parking. I leave it to you to decide which issue 
concerns you the most. If the present members of student 
government continue to insist upon playing in the sandbox 
there is little that can be done to stop them this year. 
Just make sure that next year they do it on their own time

Coalition For 

The Environment 



mphas 



by Paul Pratico 

The recent great i 
which has been put on environ- 
mental pollution of all sorts has 
dismayed and activated lo action 
a group of concerned citizens in 
Fort Wayne. The old-bat infor- 
mation available to the public has 
supplemented recendy by 
the finding of Dr. Robert Rhapiro. 
Environmental pollution can in 
! respects alter the genetic 
structure. Instant mutations! 
These more recent findings, of 
lurEc, have added impetus to 
the already feve: 



;ntly i 



ment was formed rec 

effort lo Bet the show 

in Fort Woyre. We just have not 
bad the action necessary to win 

nior victories against pollution. 

Doctor Gollieb has formed an 
action group at this campus with 
the goal of having us host tlie 
Nor^ -Eastern segment of a na- 
wide Teach-in on pollution 



to be held April 22. A group of 
students along with Dr. Codieb 
were invited to attend a meeting 
of tbe Coalition for the Environ- 
ment which was beld on Jan- 
uary 20 at the Chamber of Com- 
merce. We learned a tremendous 
amount including th fact that 
pollution control is within our 
existing technological grosp. 

The problem is one of public 
arousal to the problem in order to 
force legislation and enforcement 
for pollution control. 

Mr, Bill Sleigenvold of the city 
council filled us in on efforts be- 
ing made by the city. The employ- 
ment of a full-time engineer on 
pollution will be sought after 
money is obtained from the Fed- 

il government. Again, tbe pro- 
gress is slow; wbnt is needed is 

incertcd public action now! 

Control of environmental pol- 
lution is the noble cau'e to be 
taken up by concerned students in 
tbe 1970's. All interested student' 
lid contact Dr. Gottlieb, Paul 



Letters 
to the editor 



The student at Ft. Wayne cam- 
pus is rarely given die opportun- 
ity to express hb own will. One 
exception is that students do 
choose their own courses and pro- 
fessors — or so I thought, I en- 
rolled in U02 with Mrs. Standley. 
The class met and was loo large 
to be accommodated in a stand- 
ard classroom. Mrs. Standley ar- 
rived with a gentleman I did not 
recogni?e. 1 Inter learned that ihu 
man ivos Mr. Kirchhoff. Mr. 
Kirchhoff announced that the class 
would be divided in two — one 
holf lo be taught by himself and 
the other by Mrs. Standley. Mr. 
Kircboff dcfdy collected tlie class 
cards, divided Uiem, and called off 
the names of diose studenU who 
now found themselves under his 
instructions. Not once was tiic 
student consulted or asked to par. 
ticipalc in this -division of the 
class. Perhaps some of tlie stu- 
dents would have voluntarily 
chosen Mr. Kirchhotrs section. 
Possibly the students would have 
preferred a large class to an in- 
structor tbey did not sign up for. 
! signed up to lake L302 with 
Mrs. Standley. It is sbortsighlcd 
lo think I didn't consider ibe pro- 
fessor when I signed up for the 
course. I resent being herded and 
treated as if I had no right to 
participate_ in decisions affecting 
my oivn life. Choosing my own 
courses and professors is one of 
the few freedoms 1 have on this 
compus — or thought I bad.

Dear Editor: 

Where has all the money gone? 
I would like to see figures pub- 
Assume wc have 3000 full time 
Purdue students Iwe have more) 
and don't count Indiana students 
for 1 fail lo know an estimate of 
their full time status. Each full 
student pays S5.00 for an 
_. ..:lic lee. That means each year 
SI5,O0D is going out of these 
3,000 students. (There is much 
more in this fund considering 
tbe Indiana students omilted). 
What did we get back? I want 
figures! 

.J53 this around. We give the 
bursar SIO.OO for an activity jee. 
That is 530,000 for 3,000 students. 
Again, we have more students, 
more money — but where is it 
going? This year we will have 
four convocations. What else? 
Where is the list of expenditures? 
I think (tfe are getting the 
roynl shaft. 

D. L. Replogle 



Betty 



Pratico, Dave Qua 
Tonsing. 

Tbe coalition for the environ- 
cnt will again bold a meeting 

tbe Chamber of- Commerce on 
Feb. 12th at 4:00 p.m. A greater 

dent turn-out is needed. Think 
of the fact that this campus is 
lere at the present. With con- 
structive student action, we can 
build up the image of this school. 
But help is needed. A few stu- 
dents cannot carry the ball for all. 
Especially make plans to par- 
ticipate in the April 22 Teach-Jn. 
Join the cause now!!

Spoonful 

by Paul Green 

As more and more people turn to pot and many other 
drugs, the Federal Government has found it increasingly 
diffitrult to control the flow of these "mind-altering nar- 
cotics." 

Now it seems the Government feels the need for more 
stringent controls. The introduction of the "Omnibus Drug 
Control Bill" to the Senate is supposedly the answer to all 
the problems involved in the possession and sales of pot 
and narcotics. 

There seems to be one problem; the "No-Knock" pro- 
vision. This part of the bill provides for the grant of a 
special permit which allows agents to literally break into 
any residence, at anytime, with absolutely no warning. 

Several senators have expressed strong onposition to 
this provision. One of whom is Senator GOP Whip, Robert 
P. Griffin. 

He feels that warrants issued under this provision 
-should be made to be more difficult to obtain by requiring 
Federal agents to show proof that narcotics are suspetited 
on the premises to be raided. 

He also feels that it should be proven, before issuing 
such a warrant, that the destruction of such narcotics, is 
not simply possible, but imminent if an agent were to knock. 

Senator Sam J. Ervin is in agreement with Griffin, 
but also adds that the provision, if possed, creates a pos- 
sible police-state tool. He further states that the provision 
will subvert a citizen's right to consider his home a castle. 

Senator Thomas J. Dodd, who is leading the bill, has 
closed his ears to these statements and is pushing for total 
acceptance, and eventually, the passing of this bill. 

It would seem, as one studies the long-range possibilities 
of this provision, that strong and swift action should be 
taken to alt«r it. 

If it is allowed to pass, we may possibly find in follow- 
ing years a serious breach of the rights of privacy. 

The year 1984 is but 14 years away, and despite the 
warnings of George Oi-well, we seem to be threatened 
everyday with eventually trying to exist in a society such 
as he depicts. 

It is never too late for action, but if we choose to 
wallow in procrastination, we may suffer irrepairable 
consequences.

South Bend Noses Out 
Indiana-Purdue Team 



by Darrell Parnin 
The Titans from Soulh Bi 
nudged by Indiana-Purdue eai 
15-12, gained vengeance. The 



the

moved like anchored i am posts. 
Dan Auer didn't bother to ask 
what they were doing, leading 
the Mustanging Mastadons out 
front 80 on three buckets. 

Indiana Soulh Bend's finally 
got the deck crew lo raise anchor. 
With tlio Titan's Ccszew=ki scor- 
ing at 13:15 of die first half, the 
gap was narrowed 13-12. Tliree 
minules later Ccszewski put a re- 
hound shot back up lo knot things 
up 18-all. Next, die Titans' Dan 
Fye became the scoring part of 
a three on two play to lead his 
team to dieir initial lead 20-18. 

The margin was short Hved as 
die Mastodons' Gary Johnloz 
canned a diree point play to put 
I.U.-P.U. on lop 23-22 al 8:09. 

The lido ol battle slipped back 
to So. Bend on Robert Goddards'

todons' Ftcd Craft ihen canned 
two jumpers from the lop key to 
bring up a 40-40 stand-off. 

I.U. - P.U.'s Stan Schenher 
picked up his own record, laying 
it back in, to give Ihc Mastodons 
a A2A(i edge at balf-ttme. 

In the opening minules of the 
second half the lead was dead- 
locked seven times and the lead 
exchanged diree. At 13:29 of die

With 9:40 left. Ceszcwsyi con- 
nected on a free throw to give 
the Titans their largest lead 
72-62, 

But llic Mustanging Mastodons 
picked up a gusty wind of out- 
side shooting from Dan Auer who 
popped back-lo-back jumpers. The 
Glacier thai surrounded the Mas- 
todons melted, Dennis Lake and 
Mark Pull canned a bucket a piece 
as Indiana-Purdue closed in 72-

and tied it up 72-72 at 5:23.
