Obscene phone survey

"Professor warns of 'obscene' phone

local paper

Peter fadicola. chair of the sociology- 
anthropology department at IPFW.

opinion 



Party runs bureau 



Several outstanding bills were passed 
by the General Assembly during its 
recent session. Among the outstanding 
bills were the animal care facility for 
IPFW and an educational incentives bill, 
sponsored by Rep. Phyllis Pond, B-New 

Another important piece of legislation 
Pond Introduced concerned the Indiana 
License Bureau. 

She introduced legislation to lake 
control of the bureau from the political 
party in the governor's office and giving 
control of the bureau to the Indiana 
Department of Motor Vehicles. 

The idea that either political party 
benefits from licensed motorists in this 
state Is appalling. No one should have to 



contribute to a political party, yet that is 
what happens each time someone makes 
a transaction with their neighborhood 
license branch. 

Profits from the Allen County bran- 
ches contributed {26,343 to the state 
Bepublican committee in 1982 and 
127.439 to the Allen County Republican 



then 






Automobiles ore not the domain of 
either political party, but rather private 
property of the owner. 

Next spring, when the General 
Assembly reassembles, it should do 
away with the current practice of license 
branches contributing their profits to the 
political party in control of the gover- 
nor's office. 



Indy builds dome 



Hoosiers are thought to be rather 
conservative. Nothing happens in 
Indiana unless it will make an im- 
mediate positive impact, which makes 
the Idea of the Baltimore Colls moving to 
Indianapolis even more surprising. 

Foolball purists cringe al the idea of 
another team moving from an outdoors, 
natural-grass field to an indoors, ar- 
tificial turf field. Yet, if the Colts come 
to Indianapolis, another team will have 
moved indoors. 

Indianapolis is currently building a 
60.000 seat football stadium with no one 
to move in. Several colleges have in- 
dicated they will occasionally play a 
game at the Hoosler Dome, but without a 
regular tennant, the stadium will lose 
money 1 

Fort Wayne can't gel a 5,000 seat 
baseball stadium built How does 
Indianapolis get a 60,000 seat football 
stadium built? Indianapolis sells it as a 
. convention center. The city gets the 
backing of a few major corporations and 
the backing of the Marion County 



delegation to the General Assembly. 

Fort Wayne is also more conservative 
than Indianapolis Fort Wayne probably 
wouldn't have the Coliseum, if it weren't 
sold to the people as a war memorial. 
The Hoosier Dome doesn't have a tenant 
yet it is near complelion. Fort Wayne 
had a major tenant for the Coliseum 
when it was built, the Fort Wayne 
Pistons of the National Basketball 
Association. Today, the Coliseum's 
major tenant is the Fort Wayne Komels. 
a minor league hockey team in the 
Interna lional Hockey League. 

Fort Wayne may never get a baseball 
stadium After all, there is no tenant 
ready to begin play in Fort Wayne. Yet, 
maybe if the residents of Fort Wayne 
were a little less conservative, they 
would see the possibilities if a stadium 
were in Fort Wayne. 

If Indianapolis residents have enough 
courage to build their Hoosier Dome, 
Fort Wayne should have the courage lo 
build a baseball stadium.
