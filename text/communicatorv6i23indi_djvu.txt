'Public nuisance?' 

Henry L. Goodson, assistant chief of the local fire prevention bureau, has 
threatened to declare Indiana University-Purdue University at Fort Wayne a 
■ "public nuisance" if that becomes necessary to enforce no smoking rules While 
Goodson has a legitimate point (the no smoking regulations art being ignored), he 
is perhaps being a little melodramatic about the whole affair. 

Smoking in classrooms is commonplace at universities throughout t' 



OPINION 



country, while litis doesn't justify Il'l-Ws vmlattmis, il docs perhaps put them in 
better 'perspective (.inndson's statement no doubt was in response to student 
ei-impl.iinls of others smoking in their presence rather Ihan the presence of a real 
fire hazard. His initial statement, incidentally, was made prior to the 
arson-related fires in recent weeks. 

His objection that IPFW has no fire lanes is an important one, hut instead of 
using this fact as a threat, why doesn't he talk about the issue at hand? If IPFW 
must have fire lanes, arrangements should be made to design some around the 
campus. If IPFW must comply with the city's no smoking regulations, 
arrangenicnls should be made to enlorco thoni What (.oodsnn appears lo be saying 
I hough, is. "If you'll comply with this law, I'll let you violate Ibis other one. If you 
don't, I'll get you for both." 

The danger of fire is a very real one especially in light of the events of the last 
few weeks--and should not betaken lightly However, smoking violators and 
arsonists are Iwo different breeds of cat. If IPFW classrooms are no! designed lor 
smokers, the no smoking rules should lie &lt; nforced But Assistant Chief Coodson 
doesn't have lo come on like the (lest arm A "public nuisance?" Come

Pack two years of 
Army ROTC into 
six tough weeks. 



Army ROTC usually takes (our years of 
college. But now you can do it in only two. 
That's a good deal for everyone (men and 
women ) who was unable to start the 
program in the freshman year. 

You make up those missed years in our 
6-week Basic Camp during the summer 
following your sophomore year. It's frankly 
tough because you cram 2 years of classes 
into a fast summer. But if you're looking 
for o challenge, it's therel 

You get over $500 for the time you're in 
camp plus travel allowance. You're under 
no obligation. You can quit anytime (but 



over 90% completed last summer's camp.) 

You are then eligible for Advanced Army 
ROTC. You earn $100 a month while you're 
taking the 2-year Advanced Course, and 
you earn your commission while you're 
earning your degree. 

Army ROTC offers plenty of other 
advantages you should consider. Mail the 
coupon so we can send you the facts. Or,
