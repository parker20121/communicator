While the federal Department of II Ini.l 
Security feverishly works to collaborate 
its national agencies to aid the victims of 
Hurricane Katrina along the Gulf Coast, the Allen 
County Red Cross and Fort Wayne's National Guard, 
among other groups, are chipping in what they can 
to help with the cleanup of what once numbers are 
totaled will be the United States' worst natural disaster

Gulfport, Alabama, fori Wayne and the state's long- 
distance aid is the way homeland security is supposed 
to work in the United States - at least in theory for a 
disaster of this hurricane's magnitude. 

Upon its creation in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist 
attacks, die Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) 
focal point was to reduce the nation's vulnerability to 
actsofterrorism by protectingthecritical infrastructures 
and key assets from physical attack. 

As an integrated type of management system, 
the DHS was created to work as the main agency 
that combines and organizes die efforts of countless 
agencies and organizations across the United States 
to identify and reduce vulnerabilities, prepare for

with private sectors to secure critical infrastructures

The plan also said, "states should engender 
coordination of protective and emergency response 
activities and resource support among local 
jurisdictions and regions in close collaboration with

Case in point: It was the responsibility of the local 
governments along the Gulf Coast to evacuate and

The 11 critical infrastructures identified in the

government facilities; and commercial key assets

from Katrina are: oil rigs in the Cull of Mexico, ports

citizens, and the food and water supplies. 

While a natural disaster of Katrina's magnitude has 
never been felt in the fori Wayne region, in the event of 
a homeland security-threatening disaster to the area, 
the department's integrated management system and 
organization works at the local level. 

In the Summit City, a massive flood of the three 
rivers could threaten the aforementioned critical 
infrastructures and, to a lesser extent, key assets. Or 
a massive line of tornado-spewing thunderstorms 
could ravage an area county. Or, the likely worst-case 
scenario, it could be a terrorist attack that cracks the

Troubleshooting a wireless campus

and 802. 1 lb (these two are incompatible)." 

Information technology terminologies 
are difficult to understand for many users. 
but help tan be found in IT Services. 

IT Services requires that certain 
standards be met in order to connect to the 
IPFW network. 

These standards are much higher than 
those required in private networks because 



wireless network card, one should consult 
IT services. This is the best way to prevent 
potential problems. 

If anyone needs help troubleshooting 

connection to the wireless network. 

IT Services can help most problems. 

Dr. Chen explained how to troubleshoot 



for security reasons. To have our laptops 
support this, we need to install special client 
software on our laptops. This software can 
be found at m y, ipfw.edu under software, 
and then campus software. Then you can 
connect to the wireless network in Kettler 
Hall or the Engineering and Technology 
Building." 

"Bui if you also try to connect to other 
wireless networks, for example, a wireless 
UN at home, then this client may interfere 



villi the

Therefore, some wireless adaptet 
that work in home networks that do nr 
support 802. IX authentication may nc 



disable the cli 
software once you are not connected to the 
IPFW wireless network." 

Dr. Chen also talked about the Walb 
Student Union wireless network. "The 
wireless connection in Walb Union is open, 
so everybody can connect to that without 
installing the security client software." 
Because business persons, visiting 
professors and persons who do not have 
IPFW user accounts come to Walb, the Walb 
wirck'si network in open for all. 

Although studenlsdidnothave problems 
connecting to the wireless network at 
Walb, there are several problems in other 
buildings. 



Nathan Cheviron, freshman marketing 
student said, "I used to go into die Walb 
and Kettler buildings." 

Dr. Chao explained how to get the best 
wireless network connectivity. "In other 
buildings, e.g. Kettler Hall, the signal may 
not be equally strong in every location. Pay 
attention to the white boxes with 'IPFW 
Wireless Zone' on the walls; the signal 
should be strong near those boxes." 

Justin Walsh, a sophomore Elementary 
Education major said, "I bought a new 
Toshiba notebook and 1 am looking for a 
JumpDrive storage device." 

He tried to download client software but 
he needed storage to buffer the software. 
A floppy disk does not have enough room 
for the software so he is now looking for a 
(umpDrive. 

After he gave up finding buffer storage 
for the client software, he tried with a 
built-in one and he got internet access. He 
exclaimed, "I will use my notebook in the 
W.illi Muttriii Union building." 

Another challenge is students unfamiliar 
with Wireless 802. IX Client Software, 
Meetinghouse AEGIS and Funk Odyssey 
Windows Client. In order to authenticate 
to IPFW's wireless network, students are 
required to use one of these software 
programs. 

Most notebooks have built-in software 
and are user friendly with the software so 
that AEGIS and Odyssey are friendly for

Although there is cigarette, 
cigar and pipe smoking on 
campus, cigarette smoking is 
the most observed. Before the 
decree of the new smoking 
policy, there were smokers 
everywhere. Now smokers are 
forced to have close interaction 
in very restricted areas.This new 
policy is diought of as beneficial 
to non-smokers because it could 
reduce exposure to second- 

Although smokers said they 
did not like the new policy, they 
refused to completely identify 
themselves. One smoker stated 
that, "It is common sense (that 
smoking is bad) but we are 
addicted to smoking and v 
don't want publicity."

Enrollment sets record once again 

■ Growth of enrollment statistics benefited from student housing and better customer service 



For the sixth straight year, the 
number of full-time students 
attending IPFW has increased, 
setting a new enrollment 

The university recently 
released enrollment figures for 
the new school year stating 
6,9 16 students are enrolled as 
full-time students. This is an 
increase of 2.6 percent over 
2004-05. 

A new record was also set for 
class enrollments, with 121,470. 
a little over a percent greater 
than last year. Total student 
enrollment declined by a mere 
15 students from 11,810 to 
11,795.

Students can get involved in student i 
individually or in group. Studenis who would like to do 
that were not already offered have founded student clubs. There 
are currendy 98 student organizations on campus at 1PFW. The 
major five categoric ul Minimi- organizations are Depaitmental 
Organizations, Honor Societies, Religion- Organizations, Social 
tireek Organizations, and sju-t ial Interest Organizations. 

The students' organizations office suite is located at Walb

than local resources could provide for, the 
need for state assistance would become 
evident. That might be where the district's 
National Guard units (the ones sent to aid 
in Katrina's aftermath) would be deployed 
to maintain order, deliver supplies to those 
affected and/or aid in recovery efforts. 

"Every jurisdiction always has to provide 
for their own response and recovery 
planning,'' Beier said. "We've got a police 
department and fire department, so we'd 
have to have plans on how we use them in 
every day use and in emergencies." 

"The new trend in homeland security 
planning is capabilities-based planning," he 
added. "We don't plan for a terrorist event 
or a tornado or an earthquake or a flood. We 
plan to provide certain capabilities. Each 
jurisdiction has to have certain capabilities 
to be able to respond or recover from an 
incident. But you need different capability 
levels. So the idea of a district is that we 
don't need 11 highly trained hazardous 
material teams. We need one that can serve 
the area. So if you plan as a district, then we 
learn what each other's capabilities are." 

Beier said Fort Wayne has the best of 
many worlds - including one of the nation's 
premier SWAT teams. Additional district 
capabilities include, but are not limited to, 
the National Guard, hazardous material 
teams, police and fire departments, Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMAj, 
Hed Cross, Metropolitan Medical Response 
Team (MMRT), IPFW's Medical Response 
Corps, hospitals and EMS, the Board of 
Health and Public Works.

Simply Ludicrous

Journalists will say almost anything to gel 

Hurricane Katrina Mm. ceded in capturing 
most of our attention and watching the news 
coverage closely over the past week, my range 
ill emotions has gone from disgust to shock and 
guilt only to return again to disgust. 

The initial revulsion arose from the 
comparisons that seemed to flow freely from 
the news media (not to mention an imhecilic 
Mississippi governor) in the 



: destruction like 
Hiroshima or even The recent tsunami where no 
less than 150,000 lives were lost is journalistic 
hyperbole at its very worst. 

The tsunami affected 11 nations and caused 
deaths as far away as 5,000 miles. The disasters 
are NOT comparable. Simply because the image 
on yout 27-inch screen portrays the events as 
similar does not make them so. 

This does not ionic from first hand experience 
of either situation. This stems from mere 
consideration of lives lost, consideration ol 



global impact, consideration of more than the 
images that greet \ou lolloping c\ en commercial 

When coverage began, dreadful scenes from 
Mississippi inundated the screen. Destruction 
and flooding that Hoosiers such as ourselves 
have trouble comprehending bombarded our 
vision. Hurricane Katrina was our Inker, the lied 
Cross and National Guard our Batman. 

Guilt and shock enveloped me. How could 
I possibly sec this travesty as a media ploy for 
viewership! I debated writing the column I 
had planned concerning the aforementioned 
hyperbole. 

The next day however, destruction eerily 
similar to dial of the day before paraded across 
the television I he headlines bellowed about 
tolls' SOARING" to 100 deaths. 

The next day, again. ..the same streets, the 

perpetuation ol a ratings hog.

"Circle K is a club at IPFW that actually began around 1965 but

Perfection not impossible for Hartley 



The Tiger's Pen 

By Anthony Maurer 

tmauier'-ipfwcommunica 



As of Monday, the IPFW 
women's volleyball team 
has defeated everyone on 
its schedule. Their toughest 
match to date, a Hofstra/ 
Asics Invitational match-up 
against Temple, resulted in 
a five-game victory for the 
Mastodons. The returning 
Division I Independenr 
champions started the 2004 
season at a mediocre 2-2. All 
indications point to an even 
better season for an already 
solid program that has begun 

One question has lingered in 
the thoughts of avid followers 
of Kelly Hartley's squad; can 
they win every game this year? 
The skipper herself stated that 
aspirations to go undefeated 
this season would be lofty. 
She intentionally configures 
the schedule to make each 
match as hard for the team 
as possible. It is based on 
the philosophy that a harder 
schedule pushes the players 
to perform at a higher level, 
and gives them a challenge so 
there is no playing down to 
opponents. 

This is probably one of the 
more challenging schedules 
the Mastodons have faced, 
possibly ever. Tomakemalter 
worse, they play No. 8-ranked 
Florida next week. The match 



will be played on hostile 
ground, at the Campus USA 
Credit Union Classic, hosted by 
the Gators. If any team has the 
potential to put a black mark 



break the career high, (as of 
Monday) which is only forty 
kills away from her at this 






, and thai i 



win big games this year as well. 

Leit/.ke had 148 sets in the 

recent tournament at Hofstra

agauiM lemple. Iloth is also a

Idle hitter that is dangerous 



now depth at positions that 
formerly relied on production 
solely from the starters. 

Eyes will be fixed 
on IPFW's most successful 
program from the 2004-2005 
campaign. This team. I would 
argue, has the personnel, 
coaching and experience to 
down its toughest opponents 
on the court. There are always 
some tangibles that may 
impede their progress, so I'm 
going to go ahead and address

Quick and healthful meal options for busy students

Many of us chouse to go vegetarian," myself included. Some 
are semi-vegetarians [occasional iik-.h eaters), true vegetarians 
(those who do not consume meat), or vegan (those who choose 
not to eat any animals products such as nu-at, d;iiry or eggs). 

For those of us looking I* it mhih' veggie- friendly meals in a 
hurry, there are options on the IPFW campus and close by which 
are all quick, affordable, and may suit diverse food cravings. 

In a hurry, bin liaiikerin' fur a hearty vegetarian meal? Look no 
further than the three restaurants !oc atcd on campus. 

Taco Bell 

The newest on campus eatery. I, no Hell, to some, is 
synonymous with "cheap"-- tor good reason. Menu items tend to 
be oflow price. phis thev can be prepared quickly. 

Because of the prompt m ss of preparation, meaty items 
IsuchastheGurdita and Mexican Pizza) can be ordered to 

act oinmodate your vegciari. eeds in a jiflv. tine can even ask 

forbeansasasubsiinnion for bee! or thicken in meat-based 
menu items, or just order vegetarian menu items such as the 
bean burrilo or chees\ tiesta potatoes (lopped with sour cream 
and chives.) 

Taco Bell's corn-based tnst.ula and taeo shells are vegan and 
do not contain hydrogcnatcd fats, file hot. mild, and fire sauces 
are all vegan land have "clever sauce wisdoms' printed on the 
packets!] The stilt shells and Mexican rice are vegetarian. 

You can also lop off your feast with a caramel apple empanatla 
or addictively crunchy ci 

Subway 

Subwayisagre.il place m grab a quick vegetarian s 
with more than just American cheese ami iceberg lettuce on it. 
Most Subway sk. res, im hiding the campus location in Kettler 
Hall, have fresh green peppers, spitiai h. t ucuinbcrs, pickles, 
tomatoes, onions, othei vegetables, and a variety of cheeses to 
top your sandwich. 

Subway sandwich artists will c ha nge gloves and get a clean 
knife to slice your sandwich il von ask them to All of Subway's 
breads are vegetarian and some are vegan (such as sourdough 
bread and hearty Italian bread.) 

Subway's special sauces do contain milk or egg products, with 
the exception of the fat -free sweet omon (which is vegan -friendly. 
'1 he delicious cookies arc also vegetarian bin are not vegan. 
Subways website lists ingredient ami nutritional information. 

Pizza Hut 

Pizza Hut's menu items lan be baked fresh upon order. The 
Wall) Student Union location can hake a pineapple, veggie, 
or t heeseless pi/ /a upon icqnest. i he salad bar is a non- 
pizza option, with hreadstu ks and pasta served alongside the 
traditional salad fare, fruits and trackers. Moz/arclla sticks are 
also an appetizing meal choice. 

Pizza Hut's coin emeu i location next to the laco Hell means 
one can order items from both menus to best appeal to one's 
palate (try a salad from Pi/./.a Hut with an order of Taco Bell's 
cheesy fiesta potatoes, or laco Hell's caramel apple empanada as 
a tasty complement a IV/a Mm piz/a or pasta meal.) 

For added meal options, visit these restaurants near campus.

options, with crisp veggie sand wit lies, baked breads (note to 
vegans: the Frendi bread contains eggs), and salads (made with 
various greens, tresh vegetables, cheeses, and fruits.) All cheeses

IPFW's Ganz on display in FWMA 



Christopher Ganz has created a number of 
large scale self portraits that are currently 
on display in the Fort Wayne Museum of Art

One of the featured exhibits 
in the Fort Wayne Museum of 
Art's main gallery is The Tivo

&lt; hiismpher Ganz. 

The exhibit is open until 
Oct. 23, and shares the main 
venue of the museum with

"Prison Break." 

Most hoped-for resolution for the season: The 
"Lost" survivors finally find out what's in the 
hatch: ,{ sled named Rosebud. 

THE BAD 

Worst trend: Several new crime dramas ("Close 
to Home," "Killer Instinct," "Criminal Minds") 
are chock-full of gut-churning violence against 
women, a trend that's already far too prevalent 
on network drama (see also Fox's grisly "The 
Inside"). Sorry, TV types, but having a plucky 
female detective or lawyer lock up the bad guy 
does not excuse the overworked dramatic cliche 
jeopardy. And why is it mostly 



i who are brutalized? A 






tllw 



Most frightening move: The beloved drama 
"Everwood" moves to Thursdays this fall. ("Alias" 
does, too, but because the show is probably ending 
its run after this season, we're not so upset about 
that.) The WB stuck by "Gilmore Girls" when it 
went through a slump; let's hope the network 
shows the same patience when the plucky, worthy 
"Everwood" tries its best against behemoths such 
■ is "( SI" and " I lie Apprentice." 

Most frightening presences: We see dead 
people. Lots of them. With "The Ghost Whisperer," 
"Supernatural" and "Medium," spirits and 
poltergeists from beyond the grave are almost 
getting more screen time than the living. 

Most enjoyable guilty pleasure: Any soap that 
busts out the "teen-pregnancy scare" story line 
within the firsi 111 minutes should not, by rights, 
be a show that we get sucked in to. The exception 
is "Reunion," a show set among six high school 
friends over the course of 20 years. There are more 
than a few slices of cheese in this drama, but, to 
be honest, we kind of can't wait to see the next 
installment. 

Most appealing actors stuck in bad shows: 
David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel in "Bones," 
Eric Balfour in "Sex, Love and Secrets," Dennis 
Hopper in "E-Ring." 

Most missed shows: We're still mourning the 
cancellations of "loan of Arcadia" and "Judging 
Amy," and the loss of those shows is all the more 
galling once you see the rather more pedestrian 
shows that replace them on CBS' schedule: "Close 
to Home" and the supevfici.il "chost Whisperer." 

Worst monster: We're supposed to be scared 
by the critter in "Surface." but we don't get to see 
it much in die premiere. Maybe it'll grow on us ... 
like a fungus. 



People we feel the most sorry for: The CBS PR

Along with IPFW and 
Indiana, the University of Texas 
also competed. The Longhorns 
were in Indiana checking out 
the Nationals course in Terre 
Haute. 

Looking ahead to the season, 
the view is optimistic for Paris, 
his teammates and their coach 
Mike Fruchey. Despite losing 
their top runner and captain 
of a year ago in Ian Wilson, the 
men return several top runners 
including Paris, Wes Kuhn and 
Brandon Reichert. 

Wilson, who holds to school 
record in the 10k, has returned 
to the team as a coach to assist 
Fruchey in his goal of building 
a winning program and brining 
his runners to prominence at 
the school. 

"Fruchey likes to v

week except the day before a

you have to train your body to

The push of Fruchey has 
opened a wide array of potential 
from both teams, a potential ' 
that Paris feels the team will

Among the top races the 
teams will compete in this year 
will be the All -Independent

The Events of Saturday 



Novelist Ian McEwan latest book focuses on the plea- 
sures of life in a troublesome world. 



We live in anxious times. Novelist Ian 
McEwan, acclaimed writer of Atonement 
and five other novels, is certain of this. 

Yet. in his most recent novel. 
Saturday, McEwan does not dwell on 
anxiety. He is rather concerned with 
how life's pleasure— family, wine, sex — 
are interloped by the dangers, troubles, 
and tragedy's of the present. 

For this reason, Saturday is a novel 
about this very day. Not Saturday, the 
general sense, but Saturday 



no simple task, and to capture that day 
through a single man's perceptions is 
even more difficult. 

To lighten this chore, McEwan allows 
his protagonist. Henry i'emown, to be a 
neurosurgeon, a man well aware of the 
inner-workings of the mind. 

An introspective character with such 
iniellett gives the reader a better view of 
Henry life and. perhaps more important, 
the lives of his family, colleagues, and 
others he encounters on this Saturday 

Henry's practice and intellect become 
particularly important with one Charles 
Baxter, a young thug who Henry has an 

Henry would suffer a brawl with 
Charles and his gang, save for his 
cleverness. An interaction I will not

would drag dow

Still, prideful and 






Baxter will become 
ol Henry's world-weariness. And, just as 
wiih his anxiety, Henry's loves — his wife 
and family — become illuminated in his 
ruggle and danger. 



McEwan esteems atheism, suggesting 
that those who refuse spirituality allow 
themselves the fullest enjoyment of 
existence — they make the most of life 
because ii stops here. 

This open happiness in Saturday, 
despite concerns of terrorism and war, 
is ,i slightly unusual. 

McEwan rejects the notion that 
happiness is boring, or that all happy 
people are all happy in the same way. 

McEwan seems to hint that a person's 
contentment and success does not 
disconnect rhem from society and its 
problems.
