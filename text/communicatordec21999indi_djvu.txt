People often ;

filled with more music. It does not lake much to

If any of you have visited the cafeteria lately. 
you will know what we arc talking about. 
Christmas (uncs seem to be "bouncing off the

going to the cafeteria a more uplifting experience 
since there is rarely any music playing In the

great interest as IPnv has discussed its inter- 
est in moving to Division 1-A. Although most 

■ of what has been reported could be charac- 
. Icrlzed as in favor of the move, I feel that 

■ there are several issues which have been 
either overlooked or misinterpreted. 

First of all, why is IPRV so interested In 
joining the Mid-Continent Conference? As 
someone who has worked in Division I athlet- 
ics for four years, I can tell you that the MCC 
: Is nothing more than a conference of 
orphans. Not only does It lack geographic

: pursue admittance into the Midwestern

bi; allowed to watch competition In a decent 
basketball league which includes Butler, 
Cleveland State and Detroit Mercy. 

Prior to discussing conference afniia- 
: tlon, perhaps IPFW should rc-cvamine the 
pursuit of Division I status by looking at its 
facilities and past athletic department suc- 
cess. With the e.vception of the Gates Center, 
IPFW has no facilities that could be regarded 
as Division I quality. Furthermore, even if 
the school did, it would not In itself guaran- 
tee success In Division I. I consider the case 
of lUPUI. Although lUPUI's campus is home 
to the RCA Tennis Championships, the 
United States National Swimming and Diving 
Team, and has hosted the Division I Track 
and Field Outdoor National Championships. 
Ihcir move lo recent Division I status has 
1 the 



ulted il 



cring this jump to Division l-A? 

Although this seems rational, il seems as 
if i) has somehow been overlooked. As a 
result, it should be noted and taken into con- 
sideration that, with the exception of the 
men's volleyball team which has competed 
nationally in Division I for years, IPFW has 
not been able to provide another program 
capable of winning a Division 11 national 
championship. Furthermore, it should be 
noted that until IPFW can compete with 
Division II powerhouses like Tampa, Florida 
Southern and North Alabama, there is little 
chance of beating Division 1 opponents. 

Finally, and most Importantly, how will 
the move to Division 1 help IPFW in deielop- 
Ing community interest and support? 
Through making the jump lo Division I, it is 
logical to believe that IPFW would initially 
struggle. Is it too much of a reach to beliG\'e 
that Fort Wayne fans would be turned off b} 
consistently losing? Perhaps one could argue 
negatively by believing that fans would be 
pacified by seeing quality Division 1 oppo' 
nents lo campus Instead of playing ihc lower 
echelon division opponents like Youngsiown 
Slate and Oakland. One must ask themselves 
then If they are more willing to pay to ivaich 
these leams than IPFW's current Division II 
competition? 

As someone who makes his career In 
athletics. 1 look forward lo witnessing the 
evoluUon of IPFW athletics. Il must be staled, 
however, Ihat the'jump lo Division I dtjes not 
guarantee success. Instead a school must pre- 
sent the facililics and athletic iraditlon nec- 
essary to atlnici Division 1 athletics and staff. 
Therefore, prior to making the move, IPFW 
should consider these areas to ensure that 
ihc eventual jump is a successful one.

i To the rcaderi of I he Communicalor 

happ) to saj' that IPSGA Update was a success this 
When 1 started this project back in September, E 
did not knoi% hon this would work. Man, did it ever work 
We have educated the students of IPFW about what IPSGA is 
doing, I do not know how many viewers have joined since 
ihe show started, but membership has Increased. To this, 1 
credit the officers of IPSGA for the blessing of this project, 

Il was only two years before that IPSGA was barolj- on 
television. With the good has to come the bad. It is with 
heavy heart that IPSGA Update host Kim Rife will be leaving 
College 5b after our "Best of Show" (December 3). Some 
students ha\e stepped for^vard in hopes of becoming the 
new host, but no one could ever replace Kim Hifc, She has 
done a great Job as host, so with her the best of the luck as 
she graduates. As for me, I am staging as IPSGA 
Correspondent, but 1 do want to look ahead to spring of 
200D. The student government elections are about three 
months aw-ay (depending on Ihe date of the electioiis which 
will not be announced until January). 

Last year, there was only one contested race, which 
disappointed a lot of students, 1 encourage every student 
interested to stop by Walb 225 to get a petition once the 
election process begins. I would like to see four coniested 
races, like in 1998, and a slaie of students running for 
Senate and SAB, (P,S. 1 know what you are thinking and the 
answer is no! 1 like my position as is.) However, with this 
encouragement may come trouble. 

As 1 said on the first show back in September, "It onij 
takes one person to ruin eveiylhing," So, if you decide to 
run and your only goal is to cause trouble In IPSGA, my 
advice is "STAY OUT" IPSGA is doing so well and it does 
not need trouble-makers lo ruin the par^. You might be 
the person responsible for IPSGA to be ruined and that Is 
not a good story to run. 

To finish off this great semester, watch our Review- 
Show on these dajs; December 10, 17. 24 and 31 at 2:30 
p,m, and 5:30 p.m. This has been a great semester, and I 
look forward lo another great spring semester. Jla^e a 
merrj Christmas and a happy Ne^^' Year.

According to Mai Lu, biology 
major and secretary of the Chemistrj' 
Club, the club provides a stress-free 
environment in which students can

participate in many science-related 
activities both on and off campus. 
"The reason I picked this club over 
njany other clubs is because 1 like the

a Girl Scout program called "Yes She

The Chemistry Club also pro- 
motes activities and projects on cam- 
pus. Their upcoming project is the 
production of an instructional video 
for IPFW chemistry professors to use 
in their classes. According to Lu, the 
video will demonstrate proper safet) 
techniques when conducting experi- 
ments and working with chemicals. By 
creating (his video, they hope to make 
it easier for professors to explain safe-

Another project is the painting of 
the periodic table on the wall of the 
"mol hole." "The Chemiscri' Club rais-

The Chcmistrj' Club also strives

December 31 at midnight. 
Actually, "Midnite Vultures," 
Beck's newest full length 
album on Geffen Records, Is as 
far from Busia Rhymes' 
"Extinction Level Event" as 
one could possibly get. Beck is 
in full-figured glory on 
"Midnite Vultures" which 
exudes mountains of volup- 
' " s groovy rhyf " ' 



Hai 



-elation to the 
n-bop Hansons, is ripe 

"Midnite Vultures' and my 
prediction is that this album 
w'ill be the greatest living 
monument to the achieve- 
ments of the 20th ceniurj. 
'Nuffsaid. 

Okay, so let's talk about 
the goods. What you get when 
) ou buy "Midnite Vultures" is 
a musical experience so cul- 
tured and BMiravagantly tex- 
tured that you could write a 



O.J, 
Simpson trial and adhere to 
the facts! 

Fact number one: Beck is 
NOT an original founding 
member of Twisted Sister. It 
has come to my attention that 
there are several fraudulent 
websites making claims that 
Beck was the lead singer prior 
to Dec Snider. This {s wrong 
and quite frankly, the thought 
chat anyone would have the 
nerve to print such a farce 
gives me the heebie-jeebies. 

Fact number nvo: Beck is 
NOT the love child of Ceddy 
Lee and Neil Sedaka, Like the 
T\%'isted Sister farce, this farce 
has been propagated by some 
MIT students angered at being 
caught buying term papers off 
the Iniernet. Sickening, just 
sickening, 

"Midnite Vultures'" kicks some 
serious stereophonic boot). 
The first track and first single.
