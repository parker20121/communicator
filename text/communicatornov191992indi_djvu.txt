NEWS BRIEFS 

EDUCARE PARENTS CONSIDER 
TIME-SHARE OPTION 

Many parents affected by the loss of Edu- 
Care bonded together and are on their way 
to becoming a recognized student organi- 
zation, Kids Without Care. 

In the next meeting the organization plans 
to discuss child care options for next se- 
mester and elect interim officers, according 
to Lori Martin, member of Kids Without 
Care. 

"We still don't have a finai decision from 
Parkview on what services will be offered 
to us, but outside organizations have been 
in contact. And some have offered to 
help," said Martin. 

"We will also discuss the possibility of 
setting up our own time share babysitting 
service," said Martin. 

While the EduCare task force works on a 
long term solution to the child care situa- 
tion. Martin said the student organization is 
currently trying to help parents who will be 
immediately affected by the loss. 

"Many parents still don't know if they'll 
be able to get the day care they need to al- 
low them to keep the classes in which 
they're already enrolled," said Martin. 

Anyone with child care needs or concerns 
is welcome to attend the Kids Without 
Care meeting. 

The meeting will be held at 8 p.m. on 
Tuesday, Nov. 24 in Kettler Hall. Room 
227. 

FISH TUMORS TELL TALE 
OF CARCINOGENIC WATER 

As parakeets were used to tell miners of 
danger, fish may alert researchers to high 
levels of toxins in water supplies. 

Paul Baumann, field research leader for 
the National Fisheries Contaminant Re- 
search Center, will lecture on fish tumors 
tomorrow. 

"Environmental Carcinogen and Cancer 
in Wild Fish Populations" is the title of the 
seminar, and it~will begin at noon in Kettler 
Hall, Room G46. 

Fish are being exposed to carcinogens 
through sediments they use as food, and 
through water they take in by their gills, 
said Robert Gillespie, associate biology 
professor. 

Cancerous tumors are growing on the 
fish, representing the toxic conditions fish 
live in. Gillespie said it is dangerous for 
people to eat these fish, and to participate 
in other water-related activities. 

Baumann 's research as an aquatic toxi- 
cologist of fresh water fish for Lakes Erie 
and Ontario and the Black River near 
Cleveland, has shown the increase in 
rumors. 

Through microscopic examination, pre- 
screening fish livers, and discovering can- 
cer-causing chemicals, Baumann has iden- 
tified fish as accepted models of human 
cancer development. 

However, Gillespie said the health of fish 
is not directly related to human health. Ei- 
ther way, there is a link between carcino- 
gens in fish and humans. 

STUDENT WINS AWARD 
FOR MEMORY STUDIES 

Nanette Steinbronn, IPFW psychology 
major, was selected as the first recipient of 
the Undergraduate Travel Award by the 
Society of Neuroscience. 

Steinbronn won because of her presenta- 
tion on a research project entitled "Differ- 
ence in Spatial and Visual Working Memo- 
ry Performance of Rats in a Phi-Maze" in 
California. 

Steinbronn is one of several students 
working in the psychology lab of W. Jef- 
frey Wilson, associate professor. They ex- 
amined various aspects of memory in the 
rat to understand human memory and 
Alzheimer's disease. She presented the re- 
sults of a study indicating rats learn a spa- 
tial alternation task faster than visual 
alternation.

Organization celebrates 'Malcolm X' opening 



By Jim Walker 
Editor in Chief 

As "Malcolm X" Fills the- 
aters across the nation, IPFW's 
Multicultural Services hopes to 
help students learn more about 
the controversial civil rights 
leader. 

On Wednesday, Mulitculiural 
Services sponsored a presenta- 
tion of the documentary "Mal- 
colm X El Han Malik El 
Shabazz." And a discussion of 
the philosophical views of Mal- 
colm X was led by a panel of 
four IPFW students. Charles 
Washington, of Multicultural 
Services, organized the event 
which was held in celebration of 
the opening of Spike Lee's film. 

"This was designed to pro- 
mote awareness and to educate 



students more about Malcolm 
X," Washington said. "That's 
our main objective in this office, 
to help keep students aware." 

Washington said he hopes stu- 
dents learn more about Malcolm 
X through the event on campus 
and through what Spike Lee is 
doing. "A lot of people wear 
Malcolm X paraphernalia and 
don't really know why or what 
it stands for. We want to help 
them understand what Malcolm 
X was all about." 

IPFW student senator and dis- 
cussion panel member Chris 
Douse hopes Lee's film will 
help people see a true represen- 
tation of Malcolm X. "Most 
people only know the media's 
representation of Malcolm X. 
Spike shows a totally different 



side of Malcolm X. from a black 
film-makers perspective." 

"What I knew about Malcolm 
X, I read in history books." not- 




"I Hope this 

not turn out 

to be just for 
some kind of 

menl value." 

-Bettye 

Potgnard 


M 



ed Mark Bevineau, IPFW stu- 
dent and panel member. "The 
history books had two or three 
paragraphs about how he was 
for civil rights and violence. 
What we want to do is show a 
more true version of him in this 



documentary. Malcolm X was 
not about violence. He was 
about self-defense." 

Bevineau also said he expects 
Lee's film to show this under- 
exposed side of Malcolm X. 

"Spike Lee's movie will cause 
a lot of people to research Mal- 
colm X and find out more about 
him for themselves," Bevineau 
added. 

Bettye Poignard. director of 
Multicultural Services, hopes 
the Lee movie will promote 
thought about improving race 
relations. "I hope this movie 
does not turn out to be just for 
entertainment value. I hope peo- 
ple are moved to some kind of 
positive action." Poignard said. 

Poignard also noted she was 
pleased at the prospect of more 



films being made about contro- 
versial African -Am eric an lead- 
ers in the near future. "We might 
see a renewal of interest in the 
civil rights movement. I am glad 
to see some of the less publi- 
cized leaders being studied. And 
maybe we will sec some movies 
made about these leaders," she 
said. 

"The first five days that this 
film arc released arc important," 
noted Douse. "If people come 
out and support this movie in a 
big way, Hollywood will get the 
message; and we may see more 
movies made by black film 
makers and more films about 
black leaders." 

Lee's "Malcolm X" is playing 
currently at the Holiday Theater 
in Fort Wayne. 



IPFW professor's show 
opens downtown Friday 



By Mary Shrock 
Features Editor 

Show tune fanatics may be 
running to the Performing Arts 
Center in downtown Fort 
Wayne. 

"On Broadway," a musical 
collage of skits from hits like 
"Fiddler on the Roof and "The 
Music Man", will open at the 
center tomorrow. 

Larry Life, associate profes- 
sor of theater, put the produc- 
tion together. In addition to 
coming up with the idea, Life 
will direct and choreograph the 
production, 

The production is a scattering 
of acts drawn together by a uni- 
fying theme. The production 
focuses on the stylistic evolu- 
tion of musical theater from the 
1940s to the 1980s, said Life. 

"On Broadway" runs at 8 
p.m. on Nov. 20 and Nov. 21 
and at 2:30 p.m. on Nov. 23 at 
the Performing Arts Center, 
downtown. 

Life said "On Broadway" ex- 
plores a genre of American the- 
ater never examined before. 

"Most people demean the 
American musical, but it is so 
diverse an art form and so com- 
plex," Life said. 



IPFW will also see seven stu- 
dents participating in the musi- 
cal. Bridget Bannec. Anna 
Wood, Pam Good, Adrienne 
Provenzano, Coleen Godfrey, 
Stephen Hunt, and Gerry Sny- 
der will dance their way 
through "Send in the Clowns" 
and "Seventy-six Trombones." 

Melissa Long, a local news- 
caster, will narrate between mu- 
sical numbers with Dan Mona- 
han, "Pee Wee" from the 
"Porky V movies. 

Life has had extensive experi- 
ence in theater, he said. 

"I've been in theater since I 
was seven. I was a professional 
in New York, performing off- 
Broadway. I've been in films, in 
tours, in summer stock and re- 
gional theater. I've worked in 
everything," Life said. 

Life has been a professor at 
IPFW for twenty three years 
and said he doesn't have any 
desire to take on any more re- 
sponsibility than he already 
has. 

"There's no way I'd ever be a 
chairman. I am an artiste. I 
can yell at actors but not faculty 
members. Well... maybe...," 
Life said.

Bizarre thieves take car on 750 mile joy ride 

Student finds car filled with stolen goods 



By J. William Richardson 
Copy Editor 

Fort Wayne police have a sus- 
pect but have yet to make an ar- 
rest in a bizarre campus auto 
theft last Thursday. 

Police recovered the stolen 
vehicle Friday night, in the 2100 
block of Oakley St. in Fort 
Wayne, according to Sgt. Jim 
Zamora, a public information 
officer with the FWPD. 

The vehicle was a Chevrolet 
owned by Chad Conley, an 
IPFW student. 

"The car was recovered, but 
the speakers and the stereo were 
missing," said Zamora. 

From the lime of the car's dis- 



appearance Thursday to the time 
of its recovery Friday night, 750 
miles were traveled in the car. 

According to Conley the 
missing stereo wasn't the only 
damage. 

"My car was thoroughly 
trashed." said Conley, "Who 
knows what they could have 
done?" 

"750 miles in just over 24 
hours is some very serious dri- 
ving. That averages out to over 
60 mph for over 12 hours," said 
Conley. 

"The hood and driver's side 
door are smashed in. The police 
found stolen VCR's and com- 
puter equipment in the trunk. I 



found a holster and empty bullet 
cartridges in the back seat. They 
tore out the seats and burned 
holes in the carpet," said Con- 
ley. 

According to Conley, the car 
was stolen from the front row of 
campus lot 
four, near Ket- 
tler Hall, last 
Thursday night 
between 7 and 
8:10 p.m. 
Campus po- 
lice were sum- 
moned to the 
scene but by then the car was 
gone. 
"All we could hope is that 




somebody saw something," said 
campus police chief Lauren 
DenHartog. Campus police 
turned the incident over to local 
authorities afier a preliminary 
investigation. 

According to Zamora, the 
FWPD is still on the case. "De- 
tectives are working on the case 
now and have a suspect but 
haven't made an arrest yet," said 
Zamora. 

Conley said he suspects gang 
involvement in the theft. 

"There were bullets, stolen 
stereos, brand new blue jeans 
and the keys from another car in 
my ear when it was found," said 
Conley, "This is very weird. It's 



a very aggravating situation, I 
won't drive that car lo campus 
for awhile." 

Conley said he was told by 
police that gang members gel 
extra recognition for stealing ihe 
same car twice. 

DenHartog said IPFW stu- 
dents should lake precautions to 
avoid being victimized by theft. 
"We have ai least one car theft 
every year, but there could be 
more. We certainly don't want 
any more." 

"You should make sure your 
vehicle is locked, first of all. 
Alarms help and so do steering 
wheel locks," said DenHartog, 
"It can hit anywhere." 



Athletics provides budget; 
senate still against increase 



By Sarah Jakacky 
Chier Reporter 

The athletic department re- 
leased a budget and financial 
plan for IPSGA to view, accord- 
ing to Rajat Sun. IPSGA presi- 
denL 

At a meeting last Thursday, 
the athletic department dis- 
cussed further their proposal to 
levy the fee increase on graduate 
students, remove the S30 student 
service fee cap, and to increase 
the fee from S2.50 per credit 
hour to S2.75 and men to S3. 

The proposal includes a finan- 
cial breakdown, with the athletic 
department requesting 55 per- 
cent of the student services fees, 
which will jump to 60 percent 
by the 1994-95 school year. 
Controversy first arose when 
IPSGA demanded to see a bud- 



get from the athletic department. 

The athletic department said 
ihey do not want to disclose the 
details of their budget because 
the proposals are only in the 
preliminary phase.

by burdening the students 
with higher student fees."

ministrator, said they have not 
changed their proposals so far. 
They have only submitted a 
budget to student government. 
IPSGA will review the budget 
and discuss the financial propos- 
als. 

Then, the senators will vote on 
whether student fees will be 



levied. 

The main issue is not more 
money for senate, but the athlet- 
ic department's need for money, 
said Suri. 

"We want to help, but not by 
burdening the students with 
higher student fees. I am 
strongly opposed to fee increas- 
es, and I don't think any of the 
senators are favoring fee in- 
creases," Suri explained. 

The topic will be debated at 
the next senate meeting on Mon- 
day, and Suri said they will 
reach a decision soon. 

The athletic department's bud- 
get will either be approved and 
fee increases will be imposed on 
students, or the proposal will be 
denied and the athletic depart- 
ment will be forced to find alter- 
native means of funding.

Smokers and Canteen 
need to find common 



The smoking section of the cafe- 
teria needs a boost. 

The non-smoking section is 
known as the green room. It is 
bright, airy, clean. Bands ploy to (he 
non-smoking patrons on a weekly 
jasis. The tables are stable and the 
chairs arc adequate, even if they do 
leave grid marks on your thighs. The 
chairs arc all white lawn style seats. 

The smoking section is a trash 
infested, poorly lighted, stuffy hole 
in the wall known as "the dungeon" 
by many smokers on campus. Bands 
never play to the smoking patrons, 
and no. the music can'l be heard 
from the green room. Half the tables 
wobble viciously. The block or 
orange chairs are comfortable, if they 
aren't broken, and even though the 
Goodwill would refuse to look at 

The prized seals in the smoking 
section arc the booths. However, the 
plastic covered 70's style booths are 
often broken. The backs of the 
booths periodically titter the area 
when some unsuspecting student 
leans back and ends up sprawling in 
a neighbor's under-cooked cheese- 
burger. 

The scat back will lay woppcr- 
jawed for days. The owners will 
come through and piece the seats 
back together, only to slime the nest 
unsuspecting victim. Even if the 
booths continue to be usable, many 
have long gashes in the seats and 
backs, the foam filling sticking out 
tickling thighs and shoulders. Little 
scraps of plastic snagging sweaters 
and hair. The place is barely usable. 

The smokers on campus deserve a 
better place to eat, study, and take a 



break, regardless of their slovenly 
nature. 

The furniture, lighting and gener- 
al decor arc despicable. The blame 
lies with the Canteen, the cafeteria 
operators. To some extent student's 
government is to blame. If student's 
government wants to serve a large 
portion of the student body it should 
do something about the broken down 
dungeon, even if it means donating 
money to redecorate and repair the 
area. 

But the trash problem cannot be 
dumped entirely on the shoulders of 
the Canteen or student's government. 

In general smokers are slobs. Old 
cups, candy wrappers and used Hop- 
kins litter every table. Cigarette 
butts arc strewn across tables, floors, 
and chairs. The one plant within 
ashing distance of a smoker is used 
as an ashtray. 

Smokers complain about the 
dilapidated facibly but somehow feci 
they have an inalienable right to 
throw half eaten sandwiches on the 
floor. It's repulsive. 

Smokers, clean up your act. 
Throw away your garbage - you 
know, in a trash can. 

Refusing to use trash cans isn't a 
moral statement, it's rude. Other 
people don't want to look at your 
half consumed food. Other people 
don't appreciate ashes in their salads 
and on their clothes and on their 

Smokers should pick up after 
themselves. The Canteen should 
I give them a reason to stay clean. 

But either way a clean dungeon is 
better than a landfill. 



ANOTHER VIEW 



IPFW made right move 
with EduCare pullout 



Many students are upset at 
IPFW's withdrawal from the Edu- 
Care facility. Their displeasure is 
understandable, but IPFW made a 
wise decision. 

Some say the financial burden 
was a foreseeable expense. In actu- 
ality the State Developmental Center 
pulled out o( the consortium after the 
new facility was in the works. IPFW 
and the other members planned on 
splitting the costs four ways, 
between IPFW. IVY Tech, the State 
Developmental Center, and 
Parkview. 

Then the Slate Developmental 
Center pulled out, increasing IPFW's 
share of the costs. But even if the 
outrageous costs were foreseeable, 
it's no reason to stay in a losing situ- 
ation. Even if stupidity got us into a 
bind, stupidity didn't get us out. 
IPFW's share of the EduCare deficit 
is S1O0.OOO. Only 94 families from 
IPFW used the facility. We could 
have just given each family S1000 
and been in the same situation. The 
deficit does not include the money 
student's government contributed to 
the facility - close to S30.000. It is 
not the responsibility of student's 
government or the university to give 
away money to any particular group 
ofsrudenis. 

IPFW doesn't expect taxpayers to 
pay for non-academic services. This 
is admirable. The taxpayers 
shouldn't have to fork over 
megabucks to buy day care for a 



handful ofsrudenis. 

Admittedly, these student parents 
arc in a difficult situation. The Edu- 
Care task force could have been 
formed in time to arrange alterna- 
tives for parents enrolled in classes 
next semester. If this option had 
shown itself in time it would have 
saved us a lot of time and anger, but 
ii wasn't. 

It is regrettable that EduCare fam- 
ilies are left scrambling for day care, 
but the administration made the only 
choice it could. 

IPFW has gone out of its way to 
hook parents up with alternative ser- 
vices. Administrators have been 
negotiating with the EduCare center 
in an attempt to have service extend- 
ed through next semester 

Marian Zimmerman. Dean of Stu- 
dents, has compiled a list of area day 
care centers which are accepting 
applications. 

There are always what ifs but we 
arc in the situation we are in. There 
is no point in fighting about what 
happened when. We need to move 
on. The IPFW administration is 
doing a terrific job of trying to take 
care of the student parents in the 
short term and the fact that IPFW 
started the fabulous EduCare facility 
shouldn't be a cause for despair, but 
a cause for hope. Call it an excellent 
trial run. 

Maybe the next child care offer- 
ing will be affordable as well as a 
fairy tale quality facility.

Student runs through letters; 
blasts writer's viewpoint 



To the Editor: 

Some of the editorials from Ihe 
Nov. 5 and 12 editions of The Commu- 
nicator cannot go unchecked and 
require comment This commentary is 
purely reactive and offers no serious 

Quoting the half-conscious ram- 
blings of the obvious feminist, Debra 
Freeman, "Well, to all you people, I'd 
like to remind you that you live in 
America, noi some right-wing funda- 
mentalist Christian nation- although 
that's where we are heading," ii is 
obvious just how much freedom of 
speech we really have in this country- 
wherc anyone can try to get away with 
saying such flagrant idiotic bullshit as 
this. 

Think back to grade school and 
you'll remember learning that this 
country was founded on Christianity, 
and the majority of the men who draft- 
ed the original Constitution were 
"right-wing fundamentalist Chris- 
tians." It is an historical fact that our 
coiinrry'srooisarein Christianity. 

Furthermore, it doesn't even lake 
« of a field mouse to 



see lhat as a nation, we arc heading 
away from fundamental Christianity. 
Anyone who makes a statement so 
senseless as "...although that's where 
we are heading (towards Christiani- 
ty)," musi have been lippin' the bottle. 
This editorial involved no thought and 
was a complete disaster. 

And who's this guy, "Michael R. 
Smith"- Shane McCartney's room- 
male? Listen to this mind-blowing slat 
Mike whipped out of his pants, in the 
editorial tided "Gay bashers igno- 
rant..." He says, "You would never 
know 95% of the homosexuals you 
ever will sec." That number seems 
pretty damned high, figuring lhat about 
one out of every 20 to 25 people just 
around IPFW look like they're gay. 
and lhat 5% figure he leaves us with 
then represents the ones we do recog- 
nize correctly. The one-out-of-20-to- 
25 figure is probably too conservative, 
but if it was correct or even close, do 
you get what this guy is saying? The 
one homosexual out of 25 people you 
see running around this place is really 
only 5% of the actual homosexuals! 

If the gay. and lesbian community 



Why not? Bald is beautiful 



To the Editor: 

Greetings. Have you ever found 
your dead protein mass causing 
interference, havoc, and chaos in 
your life? Have you ever experi- 
enced these virtually useless amino 
acid compounds cramping your 
style? How many hours do you and 
your loved ones spend each week 
standing in front of a mirror, wasting 
precious lime, combing hair? There 
is a solution, you know.. .shave your 

Here are bui a few of the least 
obscure advantages obtainable via a 
brisk, clean, thorough headshaving... 

1. Better Hygiene 

a). Eliminate socially commu- 
nicable parasites such as crabs, ticks, 
fleas, and lice. 

b). Eliminate the market for 
Head and Shoulders and other need- 
less shampoos. 

c). Provide a more germ free and 
slerilc environment for your fellow 
man in public places. Do you enjoy 
finding strands of hair in your food at 
your local restaurant? 

2. Cost Effective Household Bud- 
geting Strategies 

a). The need for costly items 
such as shampoos, conditioners, 
styling gels, spritzers, mousse, dyes, 
colorings, curling irons, bleaches, 
hair sprays, combs, curlers, rollers, 
and brushes would quite simply 



b). For those fortunate few who 
have experienced or who are current- 
ly experiencing the immeasurable 
joy and infinite bliss of a condition 
sometimes colloquially referred to as 
"male paticm baldness," there can be 
but one question: Why prolong the 
inevitable? 

Consider, if you will, infomercials 
designed to sow the conviction that a 
chemical scalp treatment will restore 
natural hair growth. To the distin- 
guished, educated, balding individual 
there could hardly be a greater out- 
rage than the propagation of this 
false ideology, this farce, this bold 
faced, bare skinned, perverted lie, 
this heresy. 

Save a few bucks: let nature take 
its course. Better still, lend her your 
hand. ..your scissors... and of course, 
your favorite razor blade. 
3. Improved Aerodynamics 

a). Those involved in certain 
sporting activities can certainly 
appreciate these aspects of a good, 
clean, headshaving. Highly competi- 
tive individuals constantly seek that 
winning edge: the razor blade pro- 
vides a sharp one. 

Being bald makes for a sure win- 
ner. Become one of ihe select, the 
few, Ihe proud: The Headshaven.

had lo come up with a "Quote of the 
Year" Award for the advancement of 
pro-homosexual thought, they'd prob- 
ably at least consider Erin Shafer's 
quote: "Besides, homosexuals are 
quite well equipped for both oral and 
anal sex," but then scrap it completely 
when they realize after a few seconds 
of thinking, just how damned stupid 
her mindless statement is. This isn't 
Ihe same humanist who gave us such 
quotes as "...that tree over there with 
all the holes and knots is quite well 
equipped for intercourse," is it? 

If you arc half the linlc arguer you 
seem to be, it shouldn'i have taken 
much logic to realize the fact that 
"homosexuals are quite well 
equipped" is not a good enough argu- 
ment to justify the act, especially in 
light of the analogy. You cited the 
"Argument ad ignoraniium," but you 
go beyond ignorance, and your argu- 
ment is incompetent, irrelevant, and 
immaterial. Quoting you, Erin, 
"...your skills in argumeni are truly 
laughable."

Health fair pair 
thank supporters 

To the Editor: 

We would like to thank the IPFW 
community for its generous support of 
the recent Healthy Cities-Health Fatr 
(hcalth services/screening for the poor 
and homeless.) Approximately 450 
individuals received services through 
this effort. 

The winter clothing and personal 
items donated by the students, staff, 
and faculty were distributed at the Fair 
to people who greatly appreciated 
them. 

In addition, special thanks go to 
members of the following departments 
and organizations who worked at the 
Health Fair sites: Black Collegian 
Caucus, Campus Ministry, Center for 
Women and Returning Adults, The 
Marketing Association, Mathematical 
Sciences, Nursing Department, and 
Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity. 

The volunteers expressed positive 
feelings about the experience and in 
some instances gave even more than 
was expected — one student gave the 
extra winter coat he had in his car lo a 
young man without a coal for the win- 
ter. 

We are proud of the significant con- 
tribution the IPFW community made 
to this "health -care project.

Recycle now 

Landfills 
filling 
up fast 

To the Editor, 

Polystyrene can be recycled. The 
problem is dial most people don't recy- 
cle it. At the Fon. in Walb Memorial 
Union, if someone wants to buy a cold 
drink there is only one choice of cups 
sitting out: polystyrene cups. After 
you're done with your drink, there is 
only one place to put your cup: the 

The problem, according to the 
August, 1990, issue of "Scientific 

American" is that about five billion 
pounds of polystyrene go into die trash 
every year. 

So what is the problem with putting 
polystyrene in the trash? There are at 
least two problems. One. polystyrene 
is not biodegradable. If it goes into the 
trash, it will eventually just fill up our 
landfills. 

T\vo, and perhaps even more impor- 
tant, polystyrene is made with chloro-

ment because CFC's arc emitted not 
only when polystyrene is made, but 
also during and after it is thrown away. 

After talking with an employee at the 
Fort, I learned that they arc trying to 
cooperate and Ihcy are concerned aboul 
the environment. 

The employee said that the Fort 
recently switched from the large, thick 
styrofoam cups to the recyclable poly- 
styrene cups because polystyrene was 
not as bulky and would take up less 
space at a landfill. That answer con- 
cerns me because the polystyrene cups 
are being sent lo a landfill rather than 
being recycled. 

There arc at least three simple solu- 
tions to this problem. 

First, the Fort could use biodegrad- 
able paper cups. With this solution, 
CFC's are not a factor and the Fort 
would noi be responsible for ihe deple- 
tion of the ozone layer. The only draw- 
back to this idea might be the cost for 
the paper cups. I know thai I wouldn't 
mind spending a few extra cents for a 
drink if I had the assurance that I'm not 
harming the environment. 

Another solution would be for the 
students and staff of IPFW to ask the 
employees of ihe Fort for a drinking 
glass made of glass or plastic lhat the 
Fort would then wash and reuse. The 
Fort does have "real" glass for environ- 
mentally conscious customers lo use. 

A third solution would be for some- 
one lo set aside a bin to collect the 
polystyrene cups which would then be 
recycled rather than being sent to a 
landfill. The Biology Club has already 
done an excellent job collecting alu- 
minum cans for recycling. 

I would encourage the Biology Club 
or anyone else interested in helping the 
environment to consider recycling these 
cups. Scott's Foods C.A.R.E. Recy- 
cling Centers arc open daily and they 
arc willing to lake polystyrene. 

II is important that a solution is 
found. I know that I don't want to be 
responsible for even a small portion of 
the five billion pounds of polystyrene 
thai are being sent to landfills each 
year. 

Do you?

To the Editor, 

Whereas it is most commendable 
that you. Anonymous IPFW student 
(Communicator 11/12) condemn Mr. 
Willson's dangerous ignorance, it is 
deplorable ihai you. by doing so, 
create another ignorant myth. 

Obviously you have never read any 
German author or have any idea what 
German literature is all about. Let me 
enlighten you: the individual to whom 
"Mein Kampf" is attributed, was Aus- 
trian and never had and never will 
have the honor of being called an 
"author," let alone a "German author." 

Just be careful with generaliza- 
tions, for as Friedrich von Schiller, one 
of Germany's most eminent classical 
authors, once said. "Even the gods 
struggle in vain against stupidity."

To Ihe Editor: 

EdUor'i note: This Is Ihe remainder of 
a Utter from Jeff Brunson, the first 
part of which was originally published 
in The Communicator last week. 

The establishment media in our 
country serves as a promotional tool for 
the corporate elite which owns and con- 
trols it. The CIA is also a tool for the 
promotion of elitist priorities. Masking 
the underlying agenda of these symbiot-

re often is used 

a pub lic-rel alio ns catch-phrase, when 

: interests thai are being "protected" 

; those of multinational corporate e*- 
s and the foreign dictatorships 
which serve them. 

Henry Kissinger, the former Secre- 
tary of State for President George 
Bush's political mentor, Richard Nixon, 
and an avid defender of the CIA's coven 
capacities, is a living example of what 
the "U.S. interests" catchword hides. 

Following the Tiananmen Square 
massacre of pro-democracy students, 
Kissinger appeared on the Capital 
Cities/ABC corporation's "Nightlinc" 
program to publicly defend China's to- 
talitarian regime, and U.S. lies lo lhat 
regime, as vital to U.S. interests. The 
show's host, Ted Koppel, played 
Kissinger off as an independent authori- 
ty on China, failing to note who's inter- 
ests were really being served. 

The media expose "Unreliable 
Sources: A guide 10 delecting bias in 
news media" summarizes what Koppel, 
an old friend of Kissinger's, forgot to 
mention about his "independent authori- 
ty": "Kissinger,.. served as a paid con- 
sultant in dealings with China's rulers 
before and after ihe June 1989 Tianan- 
men Square massacre. His firm. 
Kissinger &amp; Associates, represents 
multinational corporations that profit 
from a friendly invcstmeni climate in 
China. Kissinger also heads China Ven- 
tures, a company engaged in joint ven- 
tures with China's stale bank." 

Koppcl's duplicity is one 
of How 1 an ova-centralized corporate me- 
dia, philosophically and financially in 
bed with government foreign policy ob- 
jectives, defrauds the public. 

Control over this information outlets 
is lightening through the merger

leashed in the 1980s. Of the 50 big 
corporations that controlled most media

National Review, nationally syndicated 
columnist, and host of the PBS show

Snyder clarifies 
role in AIDS crisis 

To the Editor, 

In a recent letter to the editor 
(Communicatotr 11/5/92) Marie 
Hersey, responding to my letter on 
sexual monogamy slated thai it was 
ihe promiscuous behavior of my gen- 
eration and the sexual revolution of 
ihe 60's which brought about AIDS 
and STD's. 

The truth has been revealed, I 
had hoped thai no one would ever 
find out lhat we of the 60's were re- 
sponsible for AIDS and STD's. bui 
now thai this dark sccrci has been 
discovered I see no reason but to 
come clean and confess. 

Yes. it is true. I and my genera- 
tion, in a frenzy of lust, travelled to 
Africa. Asia, and Haiti en mass 
where we engaged in wanton forni- 
cation with Asian monkeys, green 
monkeys, mosquitoes, and pigs. Af- 
ter salialing our sexual appetites and 
having contracted with the AIDS 
virus we relumed to the United 
States where we willingly transmit- 
ted this virus to as many of our 
friends and lovers as we could find. 
After all, in the name of peace and 
love, there is nothing more peaceful 
than a dead person. 

Not satisfied, however, with the 
AIDS virus and realizing that there 
were ways lo avoid con Hoc ting this 
deadly disease, we contacted an alien 
race with whom we had set up an in- 
lergalactic trade business in peyole 
and arranged to be sent back in time 
to a thousand years before ihe emer- 
gence of the Greek and Roman civi- 
lizations. Our mission: lo infect an- 
cient civilizations with venereal dis- 
eases (STD's) and ihercby germinate 
the seeds for the rise of a fundamen- 
talist religious sect based on sexual 
chastity, continence, and fear which 
would ultimately lead to a proclama- 
tion by Pope Paul II in 1980 stating 
that if a man loved even his wife too 
ardently he was guilty of adultery 
and thereby a sin. 

So. where Ihe AIDS virus did not 
completely succeed and STD's were 
not always deadly, we did not fail 
completely. Those earlier seeds 
sown did germinate into a philoso- 
phy which is just as terminal: ihe 
death of desire. 

Have a nice day and may your 
hand never reject your body.

Educare victims keep fighting 

Martin clarifies board member controversy, group's goals 



To the Editor: 

Although Mike Wade Slated in her 
Nov. 12, 1992 article, that I "...said a 
parent wouldn't be allowed lo partici- 
pate in the task force lo study child care 
alternatives...", I would please like to 
clarify my communications with Dr. 
Borelli and what was staled in my 
phone conversation of Oct. 27. 1992 
wilh Mike. 

I had spoken to Dr. Borelli prior to 
our Oct. 22. 1992 parents meeting ask- 
ing if one of the parents in our group 
would be allowed to sit on the task 
force lhat he was forming. Dr. Borelli 
slated that he would take my request in- 
to consideration. I informed him thai 
we would vote on a member that we 
would like for him to consider as our 
representative, He agreed. On Oct. 22, 
1992. Debbie Beck was voted lo be our 
representative. Everyone at the meet- 
ing understood that Dr. Borelli had the 
final say in choosing task force mem- 
bers. On Oct. 23, 1 sent a memo to Dr- 
Borelli with the name of our representa- 
tive. On Oct. 27, 1 received a call from 
Dr. Borelli informing me of the deci- 
sion that our group would noi have a 
voice on ihe task force as he considered 
us 10 be a "special interest group." He 
did inform me lhat there would be two 
parent representatives, Cheryl Cloyd 
and Kim McDonald, on ihe task force. 

I spoke with Mike that evening 
when she called for information on an 
article in which she was writing. When 
I spoke with her, I told her of my dis- 
cussion with Dr. Borelli and dial I was 
upset thai one of our members was not 
to be on the task force as we represent- 
ed approximately 50% of the parents 
now using EduCare. I also staled that 
we were making efforts to reach parents 
that need child care, but are not present- 
ly using Ihe facility. We felt that our 
group would have made a valuable con- 
tribution to the task force. I apologize 
to Mike if she was lcfi wilh the impres- 
sion lhat there would not be any other 
parents on the task force, for this was 



certainly noi my intent. I am fairly cer- 
tain that I had given her the name of 
Cheryl Cloyd as being appointed to the 
task force. However, I am positive thai 
she told me thai it was loo late for her 
to try to reach Dr. Borelli for verifica- 
tion. I hope that this clears up any con- 



lusio

"We will be discussing 
the options available for 
child care this spring..." 
-Lori Martin 

I would like to briefly tell others of 
the goals of our group, "Kids Without 
Care." I. To work in any constructive 
manner lo ensure child care for our 
children this spring. To this end we 
have held and will continue to hold 
meetings for parents. We have ad- 
dressed the EduCare Board of Direc- 
tors, and the Studem Government Sen- 
ate. We have contacted the media to 
moke sure this issue stays active, and 
we have also written letters to the Presi- 
dents of Purdue and Indiana University. 
2. To work in a constructive manner to 
ensure the continued availability of a 
quality and educational child care for 
D?FW families. 3. To ensure that a par- 



ents group have a formal and legitimate 
presence on ihe next child care govern- 
ing board, so lhat we have a say in mai- 
lers that effect our children's welfare. 

I would like to also clarify thai just 
because one of our members could noi 
be on ihe losk force, that this docs not 
imply that I do noi think Ms. Cloyd and 
Ms. McDonald arc not excellent choic- 
es. On the contrary, I lhank them for 
being willing to expend the time and 
energy needed to serve on the lask 

I would like to also lhank the stu- 
dents and faculty of IPFW. We are very 
grateful to the numbers of people who 
signed our petitions and gave us such 
wonderful support and encouragement. 
I would also like lo lhank Mike Wade 
and The Communicator for all of the 
wonderful coverage that has been given 
lo the pull oui of IPFW from EduCare 
and the repercussions to our parents and 
children. 

We will be holding another parents 
meeting on Nov 24, 1992. Time and 
place will be announced at a later lime. 
We will be discussing the options avail- 
able for child care this spring and the 
election of officers. Anyone is wcl-

Girl troubles? Tim knows why 



By Tim Schrelber 

Leisure Writer 

Courting has evolved quite a bit 

through the course of human histo- 
ry. At one lime, it was as simple as 
the man clubbing the woman over 
the head and dragging her by the 
hair back to his bachelor cave. 

Bui this form of dating led io fre- 
quent brain damage, as chronicled 
in the documentary scries, "Leave It 
To Beaver," where the woman spent 
her days wearing a dress around the 
house and referring to her offspring 
as a furry, tree-eating, dam-building, 
woodland creature. 

Luckily for women, the 50's 
ended. But with sophistication 
came rules, rituals, guidelines, and 
Putt-PutL 

Our dating system of today is so 
complex that volumes have been 
written, published, and then negated 
in the next book. "How To Catch a 
Woman," "What Men Really Want," 
"Women Who Want You." "How 
To Change Your Man." "OK. This 
Is What Men Want," "Really, Men 
Are Like This." "Wc Mean It, We're 
Serious This Time, All Kidding 
Aside. This Is Truly How Men 
Think" 

It seems that most of these titles 
are geared toward women. I would 
conjecture that this is a throwback 
to the brain-damaged days of Ward 
and June, where many women will 
believe any quack with a word 
processor and a catchy bile. 

Ladies, as a quack with a word 
processor and an editor who writes 
catchy titles for me. let me tell you 
this: all men really want is (o be 
held. Really. Underneath that 
macho, car- repairing, sports-watch- 
ing, sex-thinking exterior is a child 
who wants a reassuring hug and an 
affectionate name, perhaps 
"shnookums" or "pooky-bear." Go 
ahead and try k 1 know what I'm 
talking about. 

I have been a man for almost a 
year now. (A man, as defined by 
me, is someone who shaves daily, 
but is not a woman.) And 1 have 
strolled ihrough'the labyrinth of our 
modem conning rituals many times. 

Sadly, I cannot tell the men out 
there how to catch a woman. I'll be 
honest; even with my modem word 
processor with all its fancy fonts 
and my multisyllabic vocabulary 
and my goofy picture trying to make 
me look like some kind of expert 
and my PhD in Psychology. I don't 
have a clue. 

What I have learned, with my 
many trips through the mcatgrindcr 
of love, is what not to do. I don't 
know what will work, but I certainly 
know what won't work. So, here, in

or beg. 



Manipulative relationships generally 
won't go any further than marriage 
and a few kids. 

-Do not plan a script of what you 
arc going to say. When you spend 
loo much time planning your attack. 
you arc at high-risk for Cliff Claven 
Syndrome. This is where your 
mouth freezes up and you are left 
making unintelligible grums. as 
opposed io delivering that perfectly 
witty and charming line that you 
practiced for 8 hours in front of 
your mirror. 

-Do noi show any signs of fear. 
They can smell fear. 

-Do noi use any of the following 
pick-up lines: 

-"Hey, baby, What's yersign?" 

-"How's aboul marrying me and 
squeezing out a liner of youngins?" 

-"Hi. I'm not wearing underwear, 
but I am wearing Bugle Boy jeans." 

-"I've been a very naughty boy." 

-"Can 1 buy you a car?" (This 
might work, however, some women 
may call your bluff. Can you afford 
to give a new car to every potential 
date?) 

.1 -"I know' I don't say "1 love you/ 
as often as I should, but, in my 
defense, I've never seen you 
before." 

-"Would you, urn, like, urn, uh, 
you know, uh, gooutwithmesome-

to carry around a bowl and discreet- 
ly drool inio it when necessary. 

-Do not refer to a woman using 
any of the following terms: honey, 
sweelic, babe, dame, chick, broad, 
filly, vixen, hot pants, main squeeze, 
or Sinead O'Connor. 

-Do not compliment a woman 
about any part of her body below 
her neck. "Them's greal child-bear- 
ing hips," just doesn'l work any- 
more. 

-When sending poeiry to your 
counec, do not use limericks. And 
do not compare her to any of ihc 
following things: nuclear waste, 
pork, Madonna, or an enema. Do 
you really want a woman who can 
be wooed by "Shall I compare thee 
io an enema?" 

-Do not obsess about her. No 
woman deserves more than 14 hours 
of iniensc thought and/or planning a 
day. 

-Do not assume she wants you 
because she smiled at you. You 
may think you've shared a deep, 
meaningful con versa don- wiih-y our- 
eyes moment, when she is probably 
smiling aboul a funny thing her 
boyfriend said the oiher day. 

-Do not belch the Star Spangled 
Banner io impress her. Save that for 
your guy friends, who will (and 



should) be duly impressed. 

-Do noi serenade her wilh a Dylan 
imitation. And never hum. (This 
isn't really a courting rule, but don't 
do it anyway. It's annoying.) 

-Do not quote Nietzsche io 
impress a girl. Existentialism is 
generally a turn-off. 

-Do not stare. This gives ihc 
impression of an obsessed psycholic 
maniac. But if shecaiches you star- 
ing, don't jerk your head away sud- 
denly. This gives the impression of 
a nervous obsessed psychotic mani- 
ac. It's better to give the impression 
of a laid back obsessed maniac. 
Somehow, ihey seem less violent. 

-Do not think with your penis. 
Getting an objective judgement 
from your loins is like getting a 
direct, honest answer from a politi- 
cian. It doesn't happen. Also, what 
seems like a good idea to your penis 
will become woefully embarrassing 
when you come to your senses, usu- 
ally after she slaps you. 

If you follow these simple rules, 1 
can't guarantee thai you will woo 
that perfect woman. But maybe, by 
the process of elimination, we guys 
can eventually figure out what it is 
that women really want in a suitor. 

If not. we can always learn to 
belch the Star Spangled Banner. 



Date me if you dare

Teenager In Love 

Ahh love, il makes me cough. 
Hack hack. And sometimes when I 
consider ihe sorted aspects ot love 
ihal clamp on like warm, fuzzy leech- 
. Aaajgg, 



Watch your step. 

Dating: This has 
nothing to do with 
love. Don't even cry to 
tell me il docs! And I 
know, because I dale 
chicks. I'm noble, sol 
thought I'd share some 
specific success-tips for 
single men. Check it. 



&gt;: Asking a 
Ther 



Tip On 
girl out 

many different 
approaches to inviting 
a young lady io join 
you on a date. I prefer 
the direct route. Exam- 
ple: you meet a girl 

who is sitting on a bar 
stool, you could say "Excuse mc, bui 
I think you might be more comfort- 
able in my vibrating king size bed." 

Or you could, in any situation, say 
"I ... I got a van." and gesture wilh 
your head out io the parking loi. 

If the direct approach fails you, try 
holding a straight razor up to her 
neck. If you are in a dark place, a 
switch blade comb will work fine. 
What you say here is also important. 
1 prefer, "Move quietly out the door. 
Make a sound and you get cut." 

Tip Two: Where to take the girl - 




If you are hungry, take her to a fancy 
eatery. 1 recommend the Long John 
Silver's Seafood Shoppe. Beside the 
fine food. Long Johns offers the 
bonus of helping my dates feet at 
home, because quite often, they too 
wear pirate-style eye patches and 
smell like fish. 

For an extra spe- 
cial evening, I'll take 
my date through the 
Hot and Now drive- 
through, park my 
Dodge in a closcd-up 
garage, then dine on 
burgers while breath- 
ing in unhealthy 
amounts of carbon 
monoxide. Later in Uie 
evening, I like to take a 
date out dancing, 
"Dance," I'll say. "But 
if some guy touches 
you, both of you arc 
dead." Then I open my 
leather jacket and flash 



my pistol. This makes 
for hours of fun. 

Tip Three: Take her back to your 
room - Once you get her back to the 
room use ihis recommended time 
table. Talk: two minutes ("Take off 
your clothes and put this on); Fore- 
play: three minutes ("Okay, here it 
comes); The Art: five minutes ("That 
was it. What die hell do you want?") 
Afterglow: 15 minutes ("The cab's 
here bitch. Hit the bricks, please.) 

Tip Four: Be sure to call her the 
next day - It looks like I've run out 
of space for tip four. Too bad, so sad.

Holiday Blues 

Depression triggered by onset of family 'traditions' 



ByToddGilliom 
Staff Writer 

The holidays are a time of cele- 
bration and festivity, a time of great 
change to ordinary routines. Holi- 
days can also bring with them extra 



pic's personal interpretations of 
their situations. 

Brewster said, "Wc are constantly 
bombarded with the idea that 'holi- 
day' is synonymous with 'family'." 

There is also considerable societal 



season. If that wasn't the case, you John Coleman, IPFW freshman, 
wouldn't have so many unhappy said, "I'm going to Canada with a

pressures absent ihrough the rest of pressure for families to lake a ccr-

Becky Brewster, personal coun-

"Those people who don't fit into the 
classic nuclear family feel outside 
of the holiday season."

emptiness," Brewster said. 

Brewster cited three causes for 
this kind of depression. The first is 
environmental. "Increased demands 
on our time such as gift buying, din- 
ner planning and final exams add to 
people's stress levels." Brewster 
said, "People wanting to participate 
in the holidays are left with all sorts 
of extra demands on their perfor- 
mance." 

Brewster said there is a difference 
between stress and depression. Ac- 
cording to her stress is any reaction 
lo change, while depression results 
when someone is unable to cope 
with that change. 

Hobday blues arc also biological, 
according to Brewster, as people 
work to fulfill all of their increased 
demands successfully, they often gel 
less sleep and poorer nutrition. This 
lowers ihc body's ability to cope 
wilh all of the stress. 

The final and most affecting cause 
of the holiday blues arises from peo-

according to Brewster. 

Brewster does not, however, rec-

days. 

"Traditions are very important," 
Brewster said. 

Judith A. Di lorio, assistant pro- 
fessor of sociology, explained the 
social necessity of holidays, she 
said, "Holidays function essentially 
lo solidify social bonds."

Graduation, injury leave holes in starting lineup 



By Joe Heersche 
Sports Edilor 
Eileen Kleinfelier is sure lo devel- 
op a new appreciation of fractions, 
especially one half. 

KJeinfelier, the head coach of the 
IPFW women's baskelball leam, 
faces ihe 1992-1993 season without 
ihe two players thai contributed 
over one half of the team's points 
and nearly one half of the team's re- 
bounds last season. 

Lisa Miller, a Kodak All-Ameri- 
can and Great Lakes Valley Confer- 
ence Player of the Year, was lost to 
graduation, and most recently and 
unexpectedly, Pam Edwards rup- 
tured her calf muscle and will sit out 
ihe entire season. 

Edwards contributed 16.7 points 
per game last sea- 
son and set single 
season rebound- 
ing and blocked 
shot records. Ed- 
ward's 9.7 re- 
bounds per game 
and 1.6 blocks 
per game earned 
her All-GLVC 
second leam last 
season as a ju- 
nior. 

Miller's 25.9 
points per game 
pushed the duo's 
total to 42.6 
points per game 
as the team aver- 
aged 82.5. Miller 
also added 8.6 rebounds to Ed- 
ward's 9.7, giving them almost half 
of the team's total of 42.8 per game. 
Both Edwards and Miller hit over 
one half of their shots in their record 
breaking season. 

Kleinfelier has had ample lime lo 
prepare to solve one half of the 
problem, it's just the other one half 
thai she hasn't had extensive lime to 
address. 

Miller's graduation date was set 
and Kleinfelier began to prepare to 
lose ihe All-Amcrican guard long 
before she actually did. 

Junior Amy Perkins saw action 
last season to prepare for this sea- 
son's starting point guard position 
this year and had the team's besi as- 
sist to turnover ratio at 1.33. 

Kleinfelier was also able to re- 
cruit Lindy lones an All-State per- 
former out of Bellmoni High 
School Kleinfelier sees similarities 
between Miller and Jones, and ex- 
pects Jones lo contribute to the

guard position early in the season. 

'They arc similar in some aspects 
such as they both use a fake pump, 
and have good speed, although 
Lindy is probably faster. There arc 
differences though. Lisa has a bet- 
ter inside game, but Lindy has better 
range from outside," Kleinfelier 
said. 

Amy Hogan and Dawn Dressier 
should also alleviate some of the 
problem of losing Miller through 
their small forward position. Both 
saw extensive playing time last sea- 
son, and should fit comfortably in 
an offense geared for the small for- 
ward position. 

"We are going to try to play a 
more up tempo game, our post play- 
ers run the court better this year and 
Perkins will push 
the ball up the 
court quicker. 
We want more 
movement, too," 
Kleinfelier said. 

Amy Hogan's 
nine three point 
field goals last 
season will pro- 
vide the confi- 
dence to open up 
the game with in- 
creased outside 
shooting. 

The other one 
half of Kleinfcl- 
ler's problem is 
different. Il had 
to be addressed 
this season without the benefit of the 
off- season. 

However, the team's theme, 
What's Important Now. best de- 
scribes the solution to this problem. 
"The practice we have today, the 
game we are playing now, that is the 
need of our focus. Nothing is out of 
the question at this stage. We have 
14 home games plus a tournament at 
home," Kleinfelier said. 

The "What's Important Now" for 
the inside game is reluming letter 
winners Kim Recker and Michelle 
Conley. 

"Conley and Recker have good 
leadership skills, and Michelle did a 
great job in the weight room this 
summer, as did all the players," Kle- 
infelier said. 

Jennie Newhard, a six foot one 
inch freshman out of Woodlan High 
School, will also be expected lo be 
pan of the solution lo the problem 
of an injured Edwards. 
"Newhard will be the first off the
