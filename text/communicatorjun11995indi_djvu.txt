across the nation will join together Sunday for "A 
Celebration of Life." Cancer Services of Allen 
County will sponsor the local celcbraiion. 

The festivities will begin at 2 p.m. at Frankc Park. 
Featured events will include an ice cream social, 
activities for children, guest speaker Georgia 
Photopulos, a cancer survivor and co-author of the 
book "Of Tears and Triumphs." 

According to Bonnie Feldkamp of Cancer Services 
of Allen County, The Nauonal Cancer Survivors Day

For Your Information 

...tips on how lo talk to someone who is ill... 

1. Don't be afraid to ask me what I have, how I'm 
doing, or what my treatment will be. At worst, I'll 
say I don't want to discuss it. At best. I'll welcome 
the chance lo talk about my problem. 

2. You don't know what to say? What did we talk 
about before I became ill? Politics, art, religion, the 
PTA. I'm still interested. If you're a colleague, let's 
talk about work. I'd like to keep in touch. 

3. Don't try to cheer me up by telling me things 
could be worse, or I'm lucky my husband or wife 
hasn't left me, or I could have been hit by a truck. It 
doesn't help. In fact, forget about cheering me up. 
What I need most is a compassionate listener with a 
good ear. 

4. Don't assume that you know how 1 feel. If you 
really want to know ask me and I'll tell you. 

5. If I look terrible, don't say, "You look great." 
Your lie will hang between us and make me suspi- 
cious of everything else you say. h isn' t necessary to 
comment on my looks. 

6 Remember. I chose my doctor and, unless I indi- 
cate otherwise, I'm probably satisfied with him or 
her. Please don't bring me articles about other doc- 
tors, hospitals or methods of treatment unless I ask 
you to. 

7. Do bring flowers, books, games — whatever you 
think I might enjoy. Best of all. bring yourself. 
Illness changes so much. Please don't let it change 
our friendship.

Beginning in the fall semester, a $3 Technology Fee will be assessed to each credit hour. The purpose of the fee is to 
generate funds in order to increase the availability of modern technology to students. Is it worth the cost? 





•Internet and the exploration of cyberspace have long been 
realities to many college students across the nation. And 
soon IFFW students may join the ranks of cyberspace surfers. 

Indiana University recently installed a 
new user interface thai uses a hypertext for- 
mat instead of menus With this program 
users can type in the universal resource 
locator and be transported directly to any 
world- wide web page. 

Unfortunately there is little documenta- 
tion and few places on campus students 
turn to for help when using the Internet. 
One place they can go is the computer lab 
in Ketllcr 204A. Justice said the consultants

Editor-in-Chier 

With the implementation of Ihc 
Technology Fee the university will be 
bringing the Internet lo 1PFW in the near 
future. 

What students may not realize is thai the 
Internet is already here, and has much more 
to offer than just electronic mail. 

Otherwise called the "information super- 
highway." the Internet is exactly that. 



By dialing the IPFW library and logging are there to help people.

•Mandatory Technology Fee will increase the price 
of tuition. But benefits may outweigh the cost. 

Megan McArdle 
Editor-in-Chief 

On May 19 the Purdue Board of 
Trustees approved a S3 per credit 
hour Technology Fee to be imple- 
mented in the fall of 1995. 



Internet, more creative interactive 
classrooms and Internet accounts and 
access for all students. 

Steve Hollander, assistant profes- 
sor of English and self-professed 
computer freak, said "I'm hoping 



Tuiiion fees per credit hour for they will make the full web avail- 



fall 1995, including the S3 for the 

Technology Fee, will be S87.25-up 
S6.75 from last semester. 

The Technology Fee will be in 
addition to lab fees students are 
already paying and will generate 
approximately S600.000. 

Because the new fee statements 
are not itemized the Technology fee 
will not be obvious to mosi students. 

"I don't think they'll notice it on 
their fee statements," Chancellor 
Michael Wanellsaid. 
According to Wanell a committee 



able." This would include access io 
e-mail, news groups, telnet, ftp and 
Ihe world-wide web. 

Hollander said graphic-driven 
interfaces are imporiant and a neces- 
sary part of the Internet because 
information is increasingly graphic 
and sound intensive. 

If full Internet access is provided 
siudents will be able to access every- 
thing on the Internet. Hollander said 
this includes pornographic pictures, 

Hollander pointed out that most 
siudents at IPFW could buy similar 



"LIBRARY" students can conned to 
Indiana University or Purdue University 
and access information all over the world. 
Though if they want to see pictures Lhey 
will have a hard time. IPFW's present sys- 
tem docs not allow users who access the 
vax system by modem lo see graphics. 

Siudents who use the computers in Neff 
B7I will have an easier time. These com- 
puters use a graphically driven program 
called Netscape lo connect to the Inicmei 
and the world-wide web. With this program 
siudents can view all the graphics and pic- 
tures available. They need only to click on 
buttons or pictures on the screen in order to 
get where they want to go. 

Currently Netscape is only available in 
the lab in Neff; however. Sean Justice, a 
computer science major and a consultant at 
the compuler lab, said it will probably be 
installed on other computers as they arc 
upgraded. 



Terms like gopher, world 
veronica, archie and listerv may make stu- 
dents feel the world of computers is com- 
pletely foreign and incomprehensible. 

Justice said, "People would like a class, 
but I don't know if it would do any good." 
He said the lack of Internet access prohibits 
students from using all of Ihc Internet' 
resources. 

For students who are willing lo make an 
attempt, but don't know where to start, 
Continuing Education offers introductory 
classes on the use of Ihe Interne!. 

Shirley Frederick, director of non-credit 
programs, said (he next summer class

up of faculty staff and siudents. 

Wanell said, "Every dollar gener- 
ated by the Technology Fee will go 
for new student related technolo- 
gies." 

Although the exact way the 
money will be spent has not been 
determined, Wanell said ihc money

will probably go to fund more open

"The university as a reactionary 
institution is going io have a hard 
lime with thai." 

Hollander said students are 
already having a hard time citing

Purdue jacks tuition again 



Melissa Young-Flores 
News Editor 

Purdue University Board of Trustees 
announced May 19 that IPFW tuition fees 
will increase five percent for the fall semes- 
ter. Course fees jumped S4 per credit hour for 
instate undergraduaie and S9.95 for out-of- 
siate undergraduates. 

Graduates will face an increase in course 
fees. Instate graduate students will now pay 
SI 10.45 per credit hour from S105.2O and 
out-of-state graduate students will pay 
S247.35 per credit hour from S235.55. 

According to Chancellor Michael Wanell, 
the funds generated from the increase will be 
used to handle the expense of faculty and 
staff raises, increases in supplies costs, and 



university employee medical benefits. 

Wanell said students could have fell a big- 
ger pinch, but stale legislators were gracious 
this year with dollar allocations for higher 
education. 

"This institution is supported by a combi- 
nation of state revenues and student tuitions. 
The more ihe state increases its support, the 
less the students have to add to the need 
increase to take care of inflation and raises 
and what the university needs," Wanell said. 
"This year the state was more generous than 
it has been in the past. Instead of tuitions ris- 
ing 8 percent this year they rose 5percenL" 

Wanell reports, however, the tuition 
increase and the S3 per credit hour technolo- 
gy fee are not one in the same.

The Missionaries 



By Nol T. Beckley 
Managing Editor 

Reviewing music is difficult 
because ihe musicians have proba- 
bly worked very hard at their prod- 
uct. They also know more chords 
on a guitar than I do (I only know 
one, but I can play the hell out of 
it). Occasionally a band will come 
out of nowhere and knock my socks 
off. The Missionaries hail from 
Joplin, Missouri and their sound 
continues the great Midwestern col- 
lege rock tradition and the band 
owes me a new pair of socks 'cause 
I cannot find the ones they knocked 
off. The band's influences range 
from The Replacements to John 
Mellencamp. 

When I first received a copy of 
the Missionaries' sophomore CD 
"Superficial Self-Amusement," I 
immediately was drawn to it 
because of the title. Anytime mas- 
turbation is intimated, I'm interest- 
ed. Which probably explains my 
infatuation with Tori Amos and 
Madonna, but I won't take you 
there. 

The first cut, "Walk Away." 
sings out for friendship and the fear 
of being forgotten by an old lover. 



The song's chorus "Don't forget 
me now that our paths have grown 
apart/I'm still here for you my 
frienri/I apologize Tor my insecuri- 
ties/Walk away and smile." Wc 
have all been there before in our 
life and Greg Krutsingcr's vocals 
brings a vibrant mood to the lyrics 
that seem absent from many "col- 
lege rock" bands. His voice, like 
the Missionaries, is distinct but 
diverse. 

In over 60 minutes of music, the 
Missionaxics range from sweetly 
poignant to brutally honest. On the 
track "Higher." Krutsinger belts 
out: "Have you ever had a woman 
walk all over you/Walk over you 
with those heels and drive them 
into your back/Seems to me she's 
gotta disease/A pure case of bcin' a 
bitch/Better find yourself another 
woman/One that will treat you 
good, good, good." To any man 
who is divorced, these lyrics should 
hit very close to your soul. 

I have not been able to find this 
CD in any of the local record stores 
so I am assuming cither it has not 
been publicly released or Fort 
Wayne is drastically behind the 
limes when it comes to music, Go 
Figure!

Features Editor 

This is a story about a woman 
who warned to make it in show 
business. Like many women just 
starting in "the business," this 
woman had to resort to posing nude 
in a men's magazine to get noticed. 
Once she was famous, those early 
pictures came back to haunt her and 
ruined her career. 

But only temporarily. 

It takes a certain type of woman 
to be able to overcome such a mess 
... a talented one. And that is just 
what Vanessa Williams is, 
extremely talented. No greater evi- 
dence of this exists than the former 
Miss America's back-to-back 
release of "The Sweetest Days" and 
"Kiss Of The Spider Woman." 

Her first two albums, "The 
Right Stuff and "The Comfort 
Zone" were collections of pop and 
R&amp;B tunes that established her as a 
good singer. Such dance songs as 
"Running Back To You" and 
"(He's Got) The Look" were mod- 
erately successful, but it was the 
ballads that radio embraced and re- 
established Williams as a star. Her 
first top ten hit "Dreamin*," took 
the music industry, which almost 
was all too ready to write her off as 
a has been, by surprise. 

Bui it wasn't until "Save The 
Best For Last." Williams' first 
number one single, thai she proved 
she was over the big scandal which 
would have ruined anyone else. 
This was only proven again when 
"Love Is," a duct with multi-talent- 
ed Brian McKnight, reached num- 
ber one as well. 

Fast forward to 1994, three 
years after the release of "The 
Comfort Zone." Chita Rivera had 
just finished a most successful. 
career-reviving run as 'The Spider 
Woman" Aurora on Broadway. 
When it came lime to find Rivera's 
replacement, Williams was named 
the new Spider Woman, weeks 
after having her third child and in 
the middle of recording her ifiird 
album. The Sweetest Days." With 
an exhausting schedule of record- 
ing during the day and performing 
at night. "The Sweetest Days" is 
completed 

What has been released is anoth- 
er chapter in the growth of Vanessa 
Williams No longer relying on 
catchy dance numbers to gain an 
audience. "Days" is a collection of 
ballads, R&amp;B, and jazz numbers 
that shows a more mature side of 
the artist. An obvious collaborator, 
Babyface, has written two songs, 
the good "You Can't Run" and the 
better "Betcha Never." A less likely 
guest appearance by Sting is fea- 
tured on his song. "Sister Moon." 
Let's hope that tbese two sing 



together again in the future. 

Only Williams could sing a hip 
hop flavored tribute to jazz great 
Ella Fitzgerald featuring a rap 
bridge. Such a feat is accomplished 
on "Ell amenta!." Other noteworthy 
songs include the Patti Austin 
penned "You Don't Have To Say 
Your Sorry" and the wistful 
"Moonlight Over Paris." 

A piece of work of this magni- 
tude would be enough for any artist 
to offer their audience. But the 
demand was so great lo own the 
soundtrack to Williams' first 
Broadway show that the cast went 
in to re-record the show utilizing 
the star. This is the first lime in his- 
tory that a Broadway musical 
released a soundtrack album for 
each of the show's cast 

What's great about the "Kiss Of 
The Spider Woman" soundtrack is 
that you can almost gel the same 
effect at home as you would in the 
audience of the show. Not only do 
you gel the great songs from the 
show, bul you arc treated to some 
of the dialog from the actors. 

Although "Days" is a great piece 
of work, the songs don'i give 
Williams a chance to show her true 
vocal talents. "Kiss" does, especial- 
ly on the title track. But it's not fair 
to say that "Kiss" is a Vanessa 
Williams album. She is part of a 
wonderful cast that includes the 
powerful voice of Howard 
McGillin and the actor's actor 
Brian Mitchell Many of the songs 
feature McGillin and Miichcll 
together, or McGillin and Williams 
together. 

1 rate these both deservingly a 
nine oui of a possible ten.

Who would win if Freddy and Jason 
were locked in a cell and told that 
only one would be left out, and they 
had to decide? Wc will soon find 
out. New Line Cinema is working 
on a movie thai has the "Nightmare 
on Elm Sireet" villain fighting the 
"Friday the 1 3th" freak to see who 
rules as the King of Gore. I have 
one question. Would this be consid- 
ered "Friday the 13lh, pari 10" or 
"Nightmare on Elm Streei, pan 8"?

David Bowie is now working on a 
new album, his first for Virgin 
Records. When his wife Iman was 
told thai David looked as good now 
as he did twenty years ago. she 
reportedly replied, "He's with mc 
darling, he looks belter." Just a sim- 
ple fashion tip from a supermodel.

What's the easiest way to make it in 
Hollywood? Marry a controversial 
television star, you might have 
thought, bul it turns out that's not 
always true. Tom Arnold tried that 
and saw two sitcoms fail, but now 
that he is divorced from Roscanne, 
his career is taking off. Firsl came 
the surprise good reviews of his per- 
formance in "True Lies" with 
Arnold Schwarzenegger. Now ihc 
talk is Hi.ii he is just as good, if not 
bener. in the upcoming Hugh Gram

A nasty rumor has Jon Bon Jovi cast 
in "The Crow" sequel, replacing ihe

Why not pui Debbie Gibson in the

Madonna in a sequel to "The Sound 
Of Music?" (I don't Ihink so!)

Ivana Trump, the soon lo be Mrs.

Taylot Daync will be back in the 
stores soon with a greatest hits 
package. Her last album, ihe bril- 
liant run poorly received "Soul 
Dancing." was not whji u had origi- 
nally meant lo be. She had been try- 
ing to shift her career from pop 
musK io a more rock sound. When 
she delivered her rock album. Give 
Davis told her he wanted more of a 
dance album from her. For those of 
you who don't know, Davis is the 
head of Ansia records and the man 
who shaped Whitney Houston's 
career.

Counney Cox and Jon Loviiz will

doesn't work, I'll bci money that 
she will release an "Unplugged" 
album. Desperate limes call for des- 
perate measures. 

9 — 
We may have a serious fight on our 
hands. U2 will be releasing "Hold 
Me. Thrill Me, Kiss Me" from the 
"Batman Forever" soundtrack, and 
Gloria Esiefan has made a video for 
a song with 'he same title, off her 
album of covers. Is this a fair fight?

Jay Leno recendy said he regretted 
allowing Brian 'Kato' Kaclin 
appear on "The Tonighl Show." I 
wasn't too shocked to hear about 
the publicity slum. Kaio is about the

term) not to make a guest appear- 
ance on David Lettcrman's show.

• A personal interview 
by Paul Tupper, 
Features Editor 

The world of Kevin Ead.i is a 
bectic one. Since taking die office 
of student body president in May, 
he has endured his share of trou- 
bles. Aside from trying 10 adjust lo 
the rule of public figure and leader, 
he has had lo fight off many 
rumors. Some say he is a weak 
president, some say that he was 
elected because of his good looks, 
and some have even speculated on 
his personal love life. He agreed to 
this interview in order to clear up 
any falsehoods about himself, his 
work, and his future. 

P.T.: What misconception of you 
bothers you the most? 
K.E.: I don't think enough people 
know who I am or what I stand Tor. 
During (he campaign, people had 
the wrong association with me. And 
they bad some negative feelings 
toward me, and I don't know why. I 
was hearing things about me that I 
did not know myself. 

P.T.: Which of these things both- 
ered you the most? 
K.E.: People calling me a weak 
leader when 1 hadn't even been a 
leader at all. 

P.T.: What messes from the last 
administration were left for you to 
clean up ? 

K.E.: There doesn't seem to be any 
major messes so far, but I am only 
two weeks into my term. 

P.T.: Why are you qualified to be 
student body president? 
K.E.: I have worked hard to get 
were 1 am right now. I have made a 
commitment to the students and the 
university as a whole. It's really 
kind of funny. I started out as a lit- 
tle treasurer in the French club. I 
then decided that I wanted to make 
a difference on (his campus. So then 
I move on to the senate the next 



year. I was one of ihc most active 
senators here. Then Mark [King. 
last year's president] saw my hard 
work and put me on (he cabinet as 
exterior relations where I got a 
chance to get to know the other uni- 
versities and bow they operate. 



dorms would help, but on a small 
scale. And if Walb Student Union 
was more student friendly, more of 
a student center. It's supposed to be

in Kettler Hall studying. If we

Kevin Eads hard at work on campus in the Students' 
Government offices. 



After the cabinet ceased, I went 
back to the senate. I went on two 
committees again, the only member 
to do so last year. Even during that 
hiatus, I spent every day up here (in 
the government offices), talking and 
trying to find out what was going 
on, trying to do my pan. 

P.T.: What's the biggest problem at 
IPFW? 

K.E.: There is not really anything to 
keep the students here. We have a 
lol of organizations. It's probably a 
problem of just being a commuter 
campus. Students come to school 
and then they leave. 1 want to spend 
some lime on campus and I want an 
all-around college experience. 
There are some things missing as 
far as personal interaction. I would 
like to sec more personal interaction 
between the students. There is no 
reason why we can't do that. 

P.T.: What can we as students do to 

fix that? 

K.E.: It's hard for many students 

because they live far away. I think 



pic would come here and eat. Then 
they may bang out here; there is a 
lot to do in Walb. 

P. T. : What do you do when you are 

not doing school stuff? 

K.E.: I love going out to the clubs

with my friends I love to dance 
There is also a little cafe 1 like to go 
to called the Dash In where I go 
with my friends and just chill and 
mellow out. t like playing basket- 
ball, which has been one of my 
favorite pastimes since 1 was a little 
kid. I had dreams of being Dr. J and 
Magic Johnson, even though we all 
know that will never happen. 

P.T.: Do you think our generation 
is as bad as our elders make us out 
to be? 

K.E.: No, not at all. although 1 wish 
we were a little more active, like in 
the sixties. Why can't we be more 
like that and take a more active 
part? Though we have gotten better, 
we are starting to make an appear- 
ance. It's not covered well (by the 
media), but we are starting to make 
a voice for ourselves. 

P.T.: Art you saying people in the 
eighties did not make a voice for 
themselves? 

K.E.: No. The eighties were kind of 
a quiet lime as far as that is con- 
cerned. 

P.T.: Let's get realty personal. You 
make no bones about being a virgin 
at the age of twenty-two. Are you 
trying to send a message to other 
students who have made that 
choice ?

"Let us endeavor to live that when 
we come to die even the undertaker 
will be sorry." 

- Mark Twain 

At the Dash-In Cafe, we have two interpretations of 
Mr. Twain's comment. 

One interpretation is that Twain means we should lead a 
life of such good cheer and kindness toward others that 
when we do expire, even those who take a professional 
interest in our passing will also feel a sense of grief. 
The other view is that we should throw ourselves into life 
with such bacchanalian zeal that all we leave behind is a 
corpse so ravaged by caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol that 
when it comes time for the mortician to make the first 
incision he will, upon seeing our insides, scream like an 
eight-year old sissy and fall into a dead faint. 
Whichever view you prefer, the Dash-In Cafe has the good 
cheer, the smokes, the espresso and cappuccino drinks, and 
the micro-brewed beers you need to ruin a mortician's day.

Students deserve 
itemized tuition bill 



Tuition will be going up five 
percent next year which does not 
sound like much, but add to the bill 
the S3 per credit hour technology

more than eight percent. This 
increase would bend the agreement

and Purdue President Steve Beering 
not to increase ^^___^_^^

more than 
eight percent. 

Students 
probably will

who staged a walkout when Muth 
was suspended for traveling with 
the IPFW baseball team. 

Thumbs up to the Indiana Pacers 
for showing the country that IU 
basketball isn't the only game in

Thumbs down to Orlando Magic 
Coach Brian Hill for blasting the 
officials in game four on Monday

chances docs the big man need? 

Thumbs up to former editor-in-

stopped killing Muslims? Have the 
most blatant group of racially pure 
murderers since the Nazis been 
stopped? 

Thumbs up to Senator Dick Lugar 
for pushing himself back into the 
presidential race by saying U.S. 
intervention will most likely be 
needed in Bosnia. Lugar had almost 
been forgotten by the national press 
but this bold move shows the nation 
that Luger has the global wisdom 
sorely lacking in the White House 
today. 

Thumbs up to IPSGA President

it's boyfriend and girlfriend, then 
fiancee, and finally husband and 
wife. But what is acceptable in the 
gay community is a gray subject: ; 

I always find humor in my 
straight friends introducing us as 
"Paul and his FRIEND." Well, how 
accurate is that? I have many 
friends. If he is that special, then 
FRIEND is not good enough. 

Another often-used term is sig- 
nificant other. I bate that. It sounds 
like a question on an insurance 
form. "Who is your significant 
other?" "What do you and your sig- 
nificant other do for fun?" That just 
sounds odd to me. Almost like, 
"who is the person that makes you 
complete or significant." Well I'd 
like to think that I am significant 
without another person. 

"Lover" is a definite no-no in 
my book too. It has a sexual conno- 
tation to iL Sex is not the only thing 
that my man and I do. There is 
more of a bond there than that. I 
share things with him other than 
sex. 

Partner sounds like a business 
transaction. 

So what is there? 1 personally 
don't find anything wrong with 
boyfriend and girlfriend. And not in 
the way thai many people think. He 
is my boyfriend, and I am his 
boyfriend. Two girls are each oth- 
ers girlfriend. I will not call my 
man my girlfriend. As I have said 
before, a loving relationship does 
not have to have a "boy" role and a 
"girl" role. 

But what happens when the rela- 
tionship progresses to a live-in situ- 
ation? For some reason, many gays 
and lesbians go from boyfriends 
and girlfriends to roommates. This 
is a word that works well for col- 
lege students who share a dorm,

friends who share expenses, or non- 
friends who only live with someone 
for convenience. Roommate does 
not work for people involved in an 
exclusive relationship. 

Once there is a commitment, 
and maybe even a union ceremony, 
a choice has to be made as io what 
tide to use It only makes sense to 
me io call the man that I've "mar- 
ned" husband. This does not make 
me his wife, but his husband. And 
the same goes for females. There is 
not one certain role that anyone has 
to play in a gay relationship, so 
there shouldn't be any labeling of 
either person. Husband or wife, to 
me, suggest commitment, not pas- 
siveness or aggressiveness. Simply 
more than a boyfriend or girlfriend. 

The problem with using husband 
and wife is that it describes the sex 
of the person. Let's face it, nobody 
minds that you are married, as long 
as it is to the opposite sex. 
Therefore, some may want a word 
that shows commitment, without 
identifying the sex of the other per- 
son. 

Some have tried to find an asex- 
ual term to use. I would support 
this, if it was a word that best suit- 
ed love, commitment and devotion 
to the other person, and still mak- 
ing the sound like a person. Take 
spouse. Some use that term to mean 
'married partner,' but I think that 
spouse sounds a hit impersonal. 
Hets don't use spouse, even though 
it was meant to describe the person 
you are married io that is male or 
female. 

When we became parents we don't 
have this problem. We can say our 
child, or our children, or even kids. 
All without revealing the sex of the 
offspring. So I know that this can 
be done. So I have provided a list 
of names that 1 would like you to 
look at, and see if one would work 
for you... 

1 Mybuichhalf. 

2. My feminine half. 

3. My well you'll do. 

4. My heart-sharer. 

5. My current one and only. 

6. My support system. 

7. My equal. 

8. My dream. 

9. My co-committer. 
10. My life sharer. 

Surely we together can come up 
with something to work. If anyone 
has any ideas, please write to me at 
The Communicator and share your 
ideas. I am sure many of you can 
come up with something better than 
what I have. You don't even have 
to be gay! I am open for sugges- 
tions from anybody. 

But until then, I will still call my 
male companion my boyfriend. I 
just hope that when I go to take that 
big step to marriage, there will be 
an acceptable term to us.

Most 
people are 
either looking 
for a job or 
looking for a 
way out of their 
current job. 
With so much 
competition for 
mployment. 
Niidcvnhtierrurot it's importani 
to be aware of 
current trends. We now live in the 
age of networking, having retired 
the old terms nepotism and the 
spoils system. A new word had to 
invented because those old terms 
were associated with corruption; 
now we legitimize, even embrace, 
the notion that no one should actu- 
ally be hired 



for their com 
petence, skill, 
or merit. 

Networking is a 
mindset where 
friends, family 
and acquain- 
tances become 
functions in an 
equation. 
Networking is a 
connect the 
dots picture 
which, when 
finished, is sup- 
posed to look 
like a well- 
deserved and 
satisfying 
career. But just 
in case net; 

working 

doesn't work for you, it's still a 
good idea io read a newspaper and 
make your career decisions based 
on current trends The bulk of the 
headlines in today's papers would 
seem to predict doom and gloom, 
but there's a job-nch silver lining in 
America's smoggy future. I've out- 
lined some of the most promising 
careers below. 

Outservlce consultant: 

Corporate Newspeak for "axe- 
man." The sky's the limit with this 
careen make S50.000+ just for tem- 
porarily sitting in for the regular 
management and saying what they 
don't want to say: "I'm terribly 
sorry, Mrs. Smith, but the company 
has to sacrifice to remain competi- 
tive. Here's your Career Kit — 
inside you'll find a handsome pre- 
sharpened No. 2 Ticonderoga pen- 



and selling heavily -fortified subur- 
ban paradises. Cut enough comers 
in construction, and you wilt gain 
the extra revenue needed to hire the 
best lawyers to defend yourself 
against negligent construction law- 
suits. If you are even starling to 
question the reasoning behind that 
last statement, then stay out of the 
grift, hippie. 

Intellectual property lawyer: 
Intellectual property made big news 
when David Leitcrman switched 
networks and almost lost some of 
his old material to NBC. Another 
example: Harlequin romance nov- 
els won't publish an author without 
a pen. name — and the company 
owns the pen name. That means 
that romance authors can't switch 
publishers for a 



better contract 
without losing 
name recogni- 
tion. Crafty 
ideas like that 
can earn you a 
fonune in intel- 
lectual property 
law. There's 
no room for 
individuals in 
the future. Be 
a team player,

Beer/tobacco promotion: It 
may seem difficult right now to 
rationalize a career in promoting 
two of America's leading causes of 
death. The coming years, however, 
will provide the perfect justifica- 
tion: beer and tobacco as a means 
of population control. A degree in 
advertising is required; most com- 
panies also require that you forfeit 
your soul and any remaining princi- 
ples you may have. 

Riot police/ prison guard: No 
degree necessary; experience with 
tear gas and truncheons recom- 
mended.

Rural land developer: Despite 
our progress, a substantial portion 
of America remains covered with 
unsightly foliage and crops. We 
still have a long way to go before 
we achieve the dream of a paved 
planet, but as a land developer you 
can make a difference. Many of the 
big names of the eighties made 
their fortune buying and selling

see the day that a Fort Wayner can 
look a Chicago native in the eye

globe, confident, detail-oriented 
individuals with strong communica- 
tion skills will be needed to enslave 
and subjugate various regions.

Pbilip Morris 



recalled all their Marlboro's, 
Benson &amp; Hedges and other 
brands. Correct me if I'm wrong, 
but is there anyone in this universe 
that doesn't know cigarettes arc bad 
for you? Imagine the corporate 
suits when they realized their prod- 
uct could kill people. 
Sycophant: Sir, we've got a prob- 
lem in distribution. 
Head Cheese Exec: Don't tell me 
that not enough fourth graders are 
smoking again. I thought we took 
care of that problem when we intro- 
duced the smoking friends of Ken 
and Barbie. They even coughed up 
phlegm in the morning. 
Sycophant; No sir, the Roxy and 
Buieh dolls arc selling fine, even 
belter now that we've added a full 
pack of Marlboro Reds to the pack- 
age Sir, the problem is there is a 
chemical in the latest batch of ciga- 
rettes thai could kill people. 
Head Cheese Exec: Dear God! (Fit 
of nicotine induced coughing) Who 
would slart such a viscous rumor? 
I've been smoking for 35 years and 
nothing bad has happened lo me. 
Sycophant: Sir, you are absolutely 
right, may I help you clean your 



Head Cheese Exec: Sure, but I 
think we better recall that bad 
batch, what a great P.R. move. 
They'll think we care about their 
health. 

It seems ironic that a cigarette 
manufacturer cares about the health 
of its smokers. But then again. I 
doubt they would want all their 
consumers to die after one drag. 
They want to keep people addicted 
for years and in return you may get 
some cheesy Marlboro parapherna- 
lia to advertise the product even 
more. Let us not forget the added 
attractions of blackened lungs, yel- 
low teeth and fingers and nasty 
breath. 

But don't get me wrong; I love 
to smoke. I smoke one and a half 
packs of Marlboro menthol light 
100's each day. I know they arc 
bad for me but I don't smoke for 
the taste or because I want to. I 
smoke because I have to. I'm 
addicted to the most addictive drug 
this side of cocaine. To paraphrase 
one of (he finest minds of our cen- 
tury, Dennis Leary, a cigarette 
company could introduce a new 
brand of cigarettes, call them 
"Tumors," make the package black 
with a skull and crossbones in the 
front and people still would be 
lined up around the block to get a 
pack. 

Cigarettes slowly lower your life 
expectancy by two minutes per cig- 
arette. Al one and a half packs a

Hitler and Napoleon started as 
lowly corporals before spreading 
sunshine all over Europe. 

Terrorist: Terrorists or the IRA 
had military ranks and considered 
themselves pari of a real national 
army, even though most of their 
countrymen were ashamed of 
them. 

Terrorism, the next logical step 
after the bombing of open cities 
from the air, is Ihe warfare of 
tomorrow. Gone are the days when 
armies stood in neat lines and 
politely took turns shooting each 
other. Today, air forces systemati- 
cally target civilian morale by 
destroying vulnerable hospitals. 
schools, and marketplaces. 
However, the hefty sticker prices 
on jet bombers today prohibit you, 
the average citizen, from killing 
and intimidating all or your ideo- 
logical enemies. Kooks on a tight 
budget are in luck, because terror- 
ist bombing offers destruction of 
life and property at a price any- 
body can afford. A S25 letter 
bomb can kill an editor and prevent 
the publication of a book you don't 
like. Or bomb a mall during the 
holidays just to get your organiza- 
tion's name in the news. 

Religious fanatics, political 
underdogs, and intelligence agen- 
cies of all nations will be offering 
free training in the promising field 
of bomb manufacturing. Smug 
self-righteousness and good ratio- 
nalization skills are a must.

production is big business, and is 
going to get bigger. If the concept 
of commercial breaks on MTV 
wasn't already redundant, now the 
advertisements have become indis- 
tinguishable from the regular video 
programming (In the case of VH1. 
often ihe programming itself is a 
commercial). 

As functional illiteracy razes the 
minds of young Americans, videos 
pour in to fill the vacuum. Those 
who have suckled on the manic, 
hypermeiabolic breast of video 
lack the patience for the written 
word, and often, even lack patience 
for reason. The producers of com- 
mercials and even well-intentioned

programs, have resigned them- 
selves lo the fact that the only way 
a young adult is going lo read a

Fort Wayne Infonet breaks through cyberspace barrier

Editor-in-Chief 

In addition lo the access students

new informaiion resource is coming 
lo II'FW. The Fori Wayne Infonet 

Judy Violet, assistant directory 
of the library, said ihc IPFW library 
and Ihc Mien County Public 
Library laid the groundwork for ihe 
Fort Wayne Infoncl. Now ihe 
Infonet has more than 30 organiza- 
tions partici paling. 

"We've had before many differ- 
ent entities developing their own 
information systems," Violet said. 

"What ihc Infonci will do is lake 
that informaiion and organize il." 

The Infonet, which should be up 
and running by the end of ihe sum- 
mer, will not be an Inlemel service 
provider. What it will do is allow 
local businesses and organizations 
lo be a pan of ihc Internet. 



Sharon Parnin, director of pro- home page will eventually list 

grams at Science Central, said the information about classes ihey are 

Infoncl will allow Science Central offering, information about hands 

lo have a presence on the Internet. on science activities and resources 

She said ihc Science Central for educators as well as much more.

search of the gopher menu titles 
in the gopher they are using

you connect lo a host computer 
that allows that computer lo rec- 
ognize you.

allows users to click on high-

In addition the Fort Wayne 
Infonei will provide such informa- 
tion as: 

•Local government information 

•Data on average housing cosis 

•Newspaper headlines and top

•ACPL and IPFW library cau- 
logues 

•Calendar of events 

•Information on all businesses in 
town 

Violet said the system will 
enhance the university a lot. 

"My assumption is that the addi- 
tional terminals will also mean the 
addition of places lo access the 
Infonet." 

Besides being able to access the 
Infonei from terminals ai ihe ACPL 
and ai IPFW people will be able to 
connect to a service that will allow 
users full access lo the informaiion 
on the Infonet. 



Pvimin said ihc Infoncl will a! 
have gateways lo the Internet. 
Violet said the Infonci itself «

pay lo connect lo a service thai will 
provide full access lo the Infonet. 



Phi Theta Kappa inducts 21 new members

Phi Theta Kappa recenily 
inducted iwcnty-onc new members 
inlo their organization last month, 
increasing ihcir membership to 
more than 60. 

Michelle I. in/, public relations 
secretary for Phi Theta Kappa, said 
the organization offers a wide range

members. 

Phi The ia Kappa is open to both 
men and women who are pursuing 
Ihcir associate's degree. 

Lutz said Phi Theta Kappa is a 
brotherhood and sisterhood which 
offers scholarships for associate 
degree pursuance as well as a wide 
range of social activities involving 
odier members and ihe communiiy. 
Some of the events ihe Phi Kapps 
sponsored last year included "Safe

Frederick said. 

Students who are interested in 
using the Internet 10 do research 
associated with writing may want 
to look into "Computer Aided 
Reporting" offered by the journal- 
ism department. 

Ann Colbert, coordinator of the 
journalism department, said the 
class will be offered in the spring if 
a suitable instructor is found. "We 
need someone who combines the 
computer background with ihe 
writing." 

Colbcn said anyone wbo is try- 
ing to get a job as a reporter needs 
to know how to use the computer 
as a resource, 

"Computer aided reporting is 
not something ihat is going to be, it 
is something that is." 

It looks like die Iniemei is also 
something that is. and will be for a 
while.

much as wc can for Ihe communi- 
ty." The Phi Theta Kappas try to 
increase awareness of activities in 
our area, sponsor activities that will 
be beneficial to the children and 
provide a belter environment for 
children lo grow up in. Lutz added, 

Luiz said die group encourages 
leadership, scholarship, and fellow- 
ship. "This includes doing things 
for yourself and making yourself 
inio a more rounded person. They 
strive lo make themselves better 
both in their job field and in their 
interactions with other people." she 
said.

students pursuing an associate's 
degree who have a GPA of 3.5 or 
higher. Applicants may be full or 
part-lime student, but must have 
completed at least twelve credit 
hours. Lutz said all majors are eli- 



gible and the scholarships are not 
limited lo business majors, but to 
all majors offered at IPFW. 

i in,' said although 21 was still a 
good turnout, she was hoping for a 
better response considering Ihe 
organizations contacted 300 stu- 
dents by mail. 

Applicants who are eligible may 
receive scholarships from corpora- 
tions all over the United States. 
Lutz said il is a great opportunity 
for students to receive help with 
their education, especially consid- 
ering how hard it is lo go to school 
and work ai the same time. 

Lutz said this is a great benefit 
lo almost everyone ai IPFW 
because almosl all students have to 
work and go lo classes at the same 
lime.

niiies to meet people, be a part of 



Ihe International Honor Society and 
earn scholarships for your school-
