Student Government Unites In Coalition 



by Beth Werlman 
Student power — a catch phrase 
in today's society? What does it 
really mean? Says Mike Lam- 
borne, "Student power is all 
three sections of a college (i.e. 
students, faculty, and adminis- 
tration ) working together, all 
three having imput into the sys- 
tem. Students pay for their edu- 
cation and do have ideas of how 
they con best be taught. Student 
government, tlie representative of 
iJie students, is strong enough lo 
have thb imput." 

"Student power," says Mark 
Souder, Student Senate President, 
"is having more voice in the 
structuring and workings in a 
campus parliament. We're paying 
for our education, and should be 
in on the decisions concerning 
what faculty will be hired, what 
the cooditiona will be, what the 
union building will be like, and 
whether or not we have paid 
parking." 



Student power has taken on 
new importance here at the In- 
d ion a -Purdue Regional Campus. 
CaaUlion formed 

"Three major factions have ex- 
isted in student government as in 
everything else," said Souder, 
"the conservatives, the moderates, 
and tlie liberals. We decided in 
order lo facilitate student govern- 
ment that we would form one 
grand coalition with one purpose: 
to help students ratlicr than voting 
on political ideal ogies. 

The goals of the coalition center 
around tlie six major leaders: from 
the left, John Ainlay and Mike 
Lamborne; from the middle, 
Mike Nuabaumer and Tom New- 
man; and from the right Don 
Stuckcy and Mark Souder. Says 
Souder, "We hope that by all 
pulling together for the same goals 
we are going to have the effect 
of uniting the people who are fol- 
lowing us. We'll have a lot more 
manpower and a lot more unity 



of purpose." 
Coals defined 

The gools of ihe coalition are 
centered around six areas; 1) 
Manpower, 2) Paid Parking, 3) 
Campus Parliament, 4) Consli- 
tution and Bill of Rights. 5) Su- 
preme Court, and 6) Publications. 
Souder heads the Manpower area 
which b responsible for channel- 
ing all those who came in into 
the five working classes. 

The first and probably major 
working area, headed by Ainlay, 
is paid parking. "Quite simply," 
says Mike Lamborne, "It's get- 
ting too expensive to go to school 
here because of the S30 activity 
fee and tlie 33% tuition increase. 
The main reason why a lot of 
kids come here is thai tlicy can't 
afford lo go do\m on campus. 
We're trying lo get tlirough as 
cheaply as we can. 1, for one, 
cannot afford any more increases. 
The basic policy of student gov- 
enunent is lo get students behind 



us lo tell the administration we 
can't afford a parking fee of 360 

The Campus Parliament area, 
headed by Tom Neinnan, exists 
for the purpose of improving corn-

The Constitution and Bill of

Nusbaumer who claims, "A good 
strong constitution and a Bill of 
Rights are necessary toward any 
form of a strong working gov- 
ernment to represent studcnts- 
These two documents are two of 
tlic most important things that 
can be done for this student hody." 
The group is rewriting the pre- 
sent constitution, which according 
to Souder, "stinks ... is not work- 
able ... is very vague and doesn't

Union Board 
Meets 

Main discussions of ihe No- 
vember 3, 1969 Union Board 
meeting centered on the Winter 
Carnival, Penny Carnival, and a 
slave auction to be held by Beta 
Phi Gamma sorority. 

The Winter Carnival committee 
was alloled S800 by a motion 
made by Jim Lechleilner. Prizes 
for the snow sculptures have been 
designated as S50, S30, and §20. 

Penny -Carnival has been post- 
poned until second semester. 
Reasons for the postponement 
have been established as: 1) not 
enough entries lo support Penny 
Carnival, 2) plans were started 
too late, and 3) tlie approach to 
the Carnival must he changed. 
Either March 7 or 14 iviU he the 
new date and the Board hopes for 
a much belter resporise. They have 
set their goal as 21 booths. 

November 17 and 18, Beta Phi 
Gamma will sponsor a slave auc- 
tion. Time ond place have not 
been established ot present.

ment attempted lo get a Bill of

"it got lost somewhere in the 
process." 

The Supreme Court area is 
headed by Mike Lamborne. The 
committee is responsible for study- 
ing and plannig a workable court 
and appeals system. "The court 
in tlie past really hasn't done that 
much," reported Souder, "The stu- 
dent hody needs an appeals system 
lo go through."

Think Only 
Of Yourself 



by lennijer Bosk 

"I've looked at love from both sidea now . , .", but I 
couldn't find real love. It no longer exists in our society 
today. People are scared of others — yes, scared! They are 
either scared of the person, of what he will think, or of 
what that person will do to them. That is why the word 
"involvement" has become almost extinct at this present 
time. Become involved \vith others? Heaven forbid! 

"Join!" shouts some brave soul and we slink back into 
the shadows afraid to initiate a relationship. There has 
got to be love, and baby, love hurts — don't you know that? 
It wrecks your life, messes your mind, and beats up your 
soul. But I've got news for you— your selfishness is pushing 
involvement and groups along with beautiful relationships 
right out the door. We don't live with and for each other 
anymore. We are out for ourselves and that is it. Sink or 
swim kid but I've made it into the lifeboat already. Don't 
expect any help from me— I did it on my own and you have 
to, too. What if I tried to help and failed, what would you 
think of me? So, fair's fair. 

Tell me — do relationships with others in society really 
hurt? ". . . and a rock feels no pain, and an island never 
cries - . ." 




THE COMMUNICATOR 



Student Government 
Comment 

by Mark Souder, Student Senate President 

The Supreme Court consists of a chief justice and s„- 
assoeiate pustices, three from Indiana and three from 
Purdue. It has original jurisdiction "on general constitu- 
tional interpretation" and "on violation of const! tui on alitj' 
of Student Senate legislation." It also has "appellate juris- 
diction over all cases arising from student violatons of Re- 
gional Campus traffic rules." 

The immediate past, and still official, Supreme Court 
chief justice, is Mike Wilkens. Presently serving as an in- 
terim chief justice is Mike Lambome, Others serving on the 
court include Kay Snyder, Ed Beck, Rex Surface, and 
Bob Prough. 

The past Supreme Court passed on many decisions last 
year. Its most infamous cases were declaring the Student 
Union Board null and void, and letting Bob York off with- 
out paying over ?60.00 worth of parking tickets. Both need 
some explaining. 

The "Wilkens Court," in stopping all Union Board 
activity shortly before Harbararbar Days, probably made a 
mistake. While it was true that the Union Boards' consti- 
tution was invalid, so was the Student Senate's as well as 
many others. The real fault lies with those who petitioned for 
the stoppage including the present Student Body President. 
CordeH Mathieu, and yours truly. 

The second infamous decision by the "Wilkens Court' 
dealt with letting Bob York off the hook. This decision had 
shades of Earl Warren. Mr. York claimed the parking tickets 
didn't explain his rights. Because of this technicality, he 
was declared innocent. 

When Mike Lamborne took over, we feared an ever 
further turn toward a "Warren Court." But Mike turns out 
to be a strict constructionalist. When we considered challeng- 
ing some, organizations' constitutions, he said "No, tht 
Court doesn't have jurisdiction." Is Lamborne really a con- 
servative in disguise? Will he turn out to be the king of 
the Burghers? 

And it's not all Lambourne who is turning conservative. 
Bob Prough worries us because he's certainly no amateur 
politician. If an attractive girl appeals a traffic ticket, will 
he let her off in return for a date? We detect shades of 
another Haynsworth. 

In spite of our concerns, possibly because of them, we 
feel we have an excellent Supreme Court, In spite of possible 
personal prejudices, for example, if you're dumb or ugly, 
the Supreme Court will give you a fair hearing.

What Do You Value? 

by Karen Griggs 

News-Sentinel — Nov. 7, 1969 — Postponement of three 
Purdue University building projects, two of tkem at the 
Indiana-Purdue Fort Wayne Cam-pus mas announced Wed- 
nesday by the Purdue University Board of Trustees. 

The Board meeting at West Lafayette, indicated it had 
received -notice that the projects ivere to be delayed -until 
after July 1, 1970 the start of a new fiscal -year, by the Office 
of the State Board Director. 

Whatever you value, you seek. Does a color TV seem a 
necessity? Is a dentist on your hst? Do you buy books or 
records? Do you value, in a broader sense, good roads or 
bridges? Do you spend your money for temporary or per- 
manent objectives? THINK! 

Consider, if you will, what happens to tax money. Some 
individuals refuse to pay taxes, disapproving of the ex- 
penditures of the revenue for the present purposes. 

In Indiana, our Republican Governor, Mr. Whitcomb, 
strives for economy. In America, Mr, Nixon pleads for 
patience and austerity. In England, Mr, Wilson is losing his 
political shirt to stabilize British spending. If you believe 
in the "new economists" you must approve of these efforts 
cool the spiral of inflation, 

HOWEVER: The question is 'What do you value?' I 
would maintain that the future of Indiana (and of America) 
depends on the priority of cei-tain institutions to proceed and

A LETTER TO THE EDITOR: 

The SAM statement of purpose, 
published as Ji guest editorial in 
die October 20 issue, epitomizes 
the scare tactics uaually associated 
with totalitarianism. As university 
students, ivc deserve aometbtng 
better; if we arc asked to find the 
leaders of the October Moratorium 
guilty hy association, we deserve 
to know more iban that tbey are 
associated with the "New Mode" 
and with "other 'Americans' of 
questionable reputation," We de- 
serve to know thot die co-chair- 
men of the New Mode are Dave 
Dellinger, editor of "Liberation" 
and currently a defcndent in the 
Chicago "consfuracy" trial; Doug- 
las Dowd, n Cornell professor; 
Terronce Hallinan. a lawyer for 
the Presidio 27; Donald Kalish of 
the Southern California Peace 
Council; Stewart Meacham, Amer- 
ican Friends Service Committee; 
Sidney Peck, professor at Case- 
Western Reserve Univcrsiti'; and 
Cora Weiss of Women Strike for 
Peace. 

Again, we deseri-e to know diat 
the overall objectives of the New 
Mode, as staled in ihe current is- 
sue of "The New Rcpublie." are 
"h halt to military action on ibe 
ground 



^al of US tr. 



&gt; support of the 



Tbien-Ky 
juxtaposed widi ibc figure of 
39,047 Americans killed in Viet- 
nam ^(as of October 23), this 
doesn't appear to be such o "radi- 
cal orientation." 

Furdier, if we are asked to find 
die ISU guilty by association, we 
deserve to know more ihun that 
they have "been corresponding 
with tbc 'Conspiracy' in Chicago." 
We deserve to know that the trial 
in Chicago involves more than 
"die SDS leaders and others," 
diat the men on trial in Chicago 
are David Dellinger, previously 
mentioned as co-chairman of the 
"New Mode" and a longtime paci- 
fist; Lee Weiner, Northwestern 
University teaching assistant in 
Sociology; Rennard C. Davis and 
Thomas E. Hayden, co-founders 
of the Students for a Democratic 
Society, but not at tliis time con- 
nected with the SDS; John R. 
Ftoines, an assistant professor at 
the University of Oregon; Jerry 
Rubin and Abbott Hoffman, co- 
organizers of the Youth Interna- 
tiona! Party (the "Yippie" move- 
mentt; and Bobby G. Scale, co- 
founder and national chairmon of 
tbe Black Panthers. 

And finally, we deserve to know 
more concerning the charges than 
that these men are on trial for 
"violating the U.S. anti-riot low 
during the 1968 Democratic Na- 
tional Convention." The "anti-riot 
law" referred to is the same law 
diat Tom Wiclter of the New York 
Times is speaking of in the cur- 
rent issue of "Harper's" when he 
says that Congress "passed a law 
aking it a federal crime to cross 
state border with tbe intent to 
stir up a riot — as if it were possi- 
ble to tell what a man bad on his

Views On SDS 

A Conservative Eslimale by Don Sluchey 

S.D.S., the organization of left-wing revolutionaries 
that caused much of the campus disorder over the past 
year, is in the midst of a fantastic internal conflict. As it 
stands now, they have broken down into three major cate- 
gories. Of the three the "Weathei-men" faction is by far 
the most intriguing. 

One would have to position the "Weathermen" in a 
comer all by themselves, for they can not be associated 
with any of the traditional lefties. They find the Democrats 
just another part of the fascist establishment, they deny 
the validity of the intellectual left, and they attack the Com- 
munist party as vigorously as any Bircher. (Their comments 
on the Republicans, the American Conservative Union, and 
Y.A.F. are unprintable) 

However, one must give these soiled (literally) young 
revolutionaries credit for one thing. They aren't just sitting 
around di-scussing what it would be like if their ideas were 
adopted. They're taking actiop. Recently they moved into the 
Chicago streets and created havoc. They attacked the police, 
one one member was charged with attempted murder for 
breaking the neck of the city's corporation counsel. (200 
others were arrested) 

The only funny thing about the twisted minds that 
make up the ""Weathermen" faction of S.D.S. (or any other 
faction of S.D-S.) is that these people believe that their 
action in Chicago was something new, something that no one 
had ever tried before. How terribly hurt they will be when 
they find that a fellow by the name of Al Capone trie&lt;l 
the same thing, in the same city, several years ago. 



Historian's View Point 

by Steve Pettyjohn 

After spending the fall indulging in fratricidal in- 
fighting, the factions in student government at this campus 
have united to fight for programs that they feel will benefit 
the entire student body. Tlie formation of the "Grand Coal- 
ition"_ took place during the week of November 3-7. This 
surprising and indeed, perhaps, momentous move could be of 
great benefit to the student body. 

At the present time the students of this campus, through 
their elected representatives in student government, have 
about as much power to affect the decisions that will change 
their lives as a serf had in Tzarist Russia. There are those 
that say that the University could never be run as a demo- 
cracy. This writer doesn't believe that argument, but even 
if it is true, couldn't we have a form of limited monarchy 
instead of the present imperial government. 

We presently have a form of government that I call 
bureaucratic imperialism. In this system, the Emperor (i.e. 
President of the University) rules his domain in a manner 
resembling his cohorts of Rome. Byzantium or Imperial 
Russia. The Emperor rules through his imperial bureau- 
cracy. All empires are by nature highly centralized and they 
rule by an elite cadre of bureaucrats. The Emperor retains 
immense power, but he can not do everything; his power 
is distributed down the line through the bureaucracy be- 
cause they control the flow of information that reaches him. 
And it must be remembered that the Emperor only decides 
on the big issues as he sees them. Most of the decisions are 
made somewhere along the line by nameless and faceless 
bureaucrats. Obviously the system is not the most responsive 
. one to the needs of the people. 

Of course one is going to ask about where the Board of 
Trustees and the Faculty Senate fit into the system. Ever 
hear much of the Senate in Imperial Rome? You probably 
haven't because it didn't do a whole lot. It had some minor 
administrative and advisory powers. That describes our 
Faculty Senate. The Senate in Rome got to do one more thing ; 
it helped choose the new Emperor after the usually sudden 
and violent demise of his predece.ssor. But it had to share this 
one vital power with another organ of the state that usually 
held all the trump cards — the array. 

In Rome, the army used to legitimize the election of 



"Revolutionary 

Youth" 

On Wednesday, October 1, a group of provaoateurs claim- 
ing to be from SDS attacked students and teachers at Boston 
English High School. The week before, this same gang had 
attacked campus workers at Harvard's Center for Inter- 
national Affairs. Similar incidents have occurred in other 
parts of the country. In Detroit, nine women broke into an 
exam at McComb Community College declaring that it was 
over - and the students should listen to them. When two 
students got up to leave, they were attacked with karate. 
These actions were all the work of a group of police-agents 
and hate-the-people lunatics who walked out of SDS at 
the June convention because their ideas had been rejected. 
Led nationally by Mark Rudd, this gang calling itself "SDS" 
and "Revolutionary Youth" has absolutely nothing to do with 
SDS! They've been running all around the country attacking 
the people! No SDS chapter supports them! 

Conditions in schools around the country are rotten. 
Many high school students have rebelled, fighting to change 
things. Working people face steadily deteriorating conditions, 
and are fighting back harder and harder, as witnessed by 
the tremendous increase in strikes and wildcats over the last 
few years. The bankers and big business men who run the 
country are using Rudd's clique for two purposes. First, to 
divert people so that they won't fight back anymore. Second, 
to discredit SDS. Big businessmen and this gang are two 
sides of a coin. In working conditions, schools that oppress 
both students and teachers, and the war in Vietnam. The 
provocateurs attack the people so everj'one will forget big 
businessmen. This is the oldest trick in the book. 

The ultimate attack on the people planned by these 
provocateurs will take place in Chicago October 8-11. Built 
for under slogans like "Days of Rage" and "The Time is 
Right for Fighting in the Streets," for the purpose of "bring- 
ing the war home" - these demonstrations mean planned 
attacks on the people or, as these fascists put it in their 
newspaper (The Fire Next Time No. 2) : "We're going to 
Chicago to fight anyone who plays pig: a pig cop, a pig 
teacher, or a pig soldier." In practice their "affinity groups" 
have made it clear that they see the people as pigs — that 
they plan to fight everyone in sight! Since they make the 
people the enemy they're up against tremendous odds — and 
they're building for this action saying that it won't be a 
success unless some of them are killed! This demonstration 
is a last-hitch effort by these provacateurs to divert people 
from the real source of their oppression and to discredit 
SDS! No one should go to it; its a police trap! 

People will see through this trick. No dwindling gang 
of cops and the few they mislead will hide the facts. The big 
businessmen who run this country and who benefit from the 
war in Vietnam are responsible for the rotten conditions 
in the schools, in the cities, and on the job. SDS supports 
students', parents', and teachers' fights for better condi- 
tions in the schools; and SDS supports working people's 
struggles against their bosses. We will continue to fight 
university expansion which throws working people out of 
their homes. We oppose the Vietnam war, demanding No 
Negotiations — Immediate Withdrawl. We are backing the 
demands of campus workers, building an alliance between 
these workers and students. This tiny gang of cops, fools, 
and hate-the-people provocateurs has nothing to do with 
SDS. 



the new Emperor by carrying him on a shield. In the Uni- 
versity, this legitimization process is provided by the Board 
of Trustees. Like the army, the Board of Trustees has the 
power. And like the army of Imperial Rome, it generally 
allows the Emperor to use it in any manner he sees fit unless 
a situation arises where the Emperor must be disposed of. 
Although this was always fatal in Rome, in the university 
the Emperor has a chance to escape with his life. 

What were the usual conditions that led to the army 
disposing of the Emperor? 

Usually, it was because the peasants were raising cain 
about something. After a while, this would get on the army's 
nerves and if the old boy wouldn't do something he got the 
a-\e. And we all know who the peasants are in the university. 

Now the $64,000 question is, "What does all this crap 
have to do with lU-Pu and the student government?" The 
answer is that we might be able to get away from this form 
of imperial government. I'm not talking about democracy 
(that's too close to anarchy). But I am talking about a 
system that would resemble a form of limited monarchy. 
The Emperor would have to share his powers with the 
faculty and the peasants (oops) I mean students. 

If you like the idea of having some control over the 
decisions that will affect your life at this campus, it might 
l&gt;e wise to actively support your student government.

my opinion in favor of victory 
(as opposed to defeat) in Viet- 
nam, there have been many ru- 
mors about niyextremist activities. 
The most recent rumor which was 
reported by my wire tapping com- 
mittee, suggests that there arc a 
number of people dial arc con- 
vinced that 1 am a member of 
die Minutmen. 

Though 1 am quite flattered 
that anyone would associate me 
with such an exclusive group, 1 
must admit that I am not a 

To become a member (there 
are only 500) one must be quite 
an outstanding fellow. 

First, You must be convinced 
that die Communists will take 
over the U.S. widiin a very short 

Second, You have to he willing 
to take part in a militory offensive 
as soon as the Commies take over. 

Third, You have to be wealdiy 
enough to stockpile such weapons 
as machineguns, rocket launchers, 
and explosives. 

Unfortunately, I fit nono of 
these qualifications. 

First, I feel that for all prac- 
tical purposes die Communists 
already have control of the U.S. 

Second, I promised my mother 
that 1 wouldn't take part in any 
offensive against the Communis'ts. 

Tlitrd, I am not wealthy enough 
to stockpile such weapons as 
machineguns, rocket launchers, 
and explosives. However. 1 do 
have a large supply of nerve gas.

if the headlines read:

Young girU can gab and gossip

Cemeteries dig their graves,

and they justify a tax increase

Fireside Question Answered 



by Lts Bock 

As a student walks past the 
entrance to the student lounge or 
makes his way lo a class via the 
corridors on the ground floor of 
this building he cannot help but 
notice the signs and posters in 
hold black lettering that proclaim 
"Fireside." He may wonder what 
this activity is all about, and 
should he bother to read the fly- 
ers that arc distributed catering 
to such curiousity his question 
would be answered. Nevertheless 
in the halls or cafeteria this 
writer occasionally hears ihe com- 
ment made "just what is Fire- 
side anyivay?" 

For the benefit of all concerned 
may I answer that question once 
and for all. "Fireside" is a stu- 
dent activity sponsored by the 
students' government. Its purpose 
is lo p^o^■idc the means for pro- 
moting faculty-student di 
held at the homes of faculty 
hers. Such evening 
are for the purpose of creating 
informal atmosphere for conv 
Ration. The topic for discuss! 



may he chosen by the host or the 
studcnls attending may strike up 
a conversation with a subject tlial 
interests tliem. Informality is 
stressed, the objective being lo 
get away from the classroom-lcc- 
ture atmosphere. It is hoped that 
through such informal gatherings, 
a greater feeling of rapport Is es- 
tablished between faculty and 
studenb. 

Our last session to date was 
held at the home of Doctor Gott- 
lieb on the evening of November 
9th. Sixteen students attended the 
session and considering how in- 
tense and lively the conversation 
was 1 am sure ihat all of them 
had a most enjoyable evening. 
Other fireside sessions ivere held 
at the homes of Dean Manges and 
Doctor Engle, and proved lo be 
evenings lhat were well spent by 
those who attended. 

Watch for listings of "Fireside" 
sessions lo be held in the future 
in forthcoming editions of the 
"Communicator." I hope that you 
will make every effort to attend 
those sessions. It will be well 
wortli your while lo do so.

of ages. Toys, of course, can be 
almost any type or kind; books 
should be suitable to young juve- 
niles (they are particularly fond 
of American comic books), and 
clothing should be of the hot 

licularly suitable. 

Tlie deadline for shipping all 
gifts is November 15, so contri- 
butions should be dcUvered as 
soon as possible. 

All Rogers' Markets througbout 
the city are cooperating witb the 
project and providing space for 
receptacles where the gifts may 
be dropiied off. Likewise, gifts 
may be delivered to the Informa- 
tion Desk on the Indiana-Purdue 
Fort Wayne Campus. AH gifts 
should be identified "For Vietna- 
mese Orphans Christmas Project." 
Another drop-off point for Christ- 
mas gifts is the fraternity house 
at 2306 New Haven Ave., tele- 
phone 422-5396. 

In discussing tlie project today, 
Gillie said lhat the fraternity's 
biggest task is finding some gen- 
erous sponsor who might be will- 
ing to pick up the tab for the 
postage necessary lo ship the toys, 
books, and clotliing overseas. 
"And," he reiterated, "ibat No- 
vember 15 deadline is not Ear off."

THE COMMUNICATOR 



Man Expresses Self 
Through Photography 



Today, man expresses himself 
in many ways, ihiougb writine, 
music, paintings, and even phn- 
lography. Few people give much 
thought to the principle behind 
this phenomenon; fewer yet arc 
owarc of its origin. The serious 
photographer should have the 
knowledge of the history of pho- 
tography to Tully appreciate its 
workings. In this article, the auth- 
ors mil attempt to enlighten the 
reader on the early history of 
photography. 

Before the invention of pho- 
tography, artists used a device 
called a camera obscura to help 
them convert large, three-dimen- 
sional scenes, into small, tivo- 
dimcnsionol ones. This primitive 
"camera" was a light box, with o 
lens at one end. At the top of the 
box was a ground glass scrcun, 
shielded by a hood. As light en- 
tered the lens, an image ivas 
formed on tlie mirror and re- 
flected to tiie ground glass. The 
ertist could trace the image, or 
study it while he painted. This 
process was a laborious project. 
Louis Duciuerrc, a painter, and a 
user of lliis box, desired a way 
to Irnnfifer the cameras image 
pormonenlly. In 1824, he began to 
experiment in an attempt to 'fix' 
the image. 

In 1820, Daqucrre, teaming up 
with another experimenter named 
Joseph Niepcc, started work to 
improve upon Niepces' process. 
Niepcc had recorded the camera 
image spontaneously by the action 
of light. Through various exper- 
iments, he discovered the process 
now known as photogravure. In 
1831, Daqucrre made an obs 
vation tliat was later to beco 
important- He noted that iodi 
was very sensitive to light, 
also discovered the phenomenon 
solarizalion — the reversal of lone 
by extreme overexposure. 

In 1835, Daqucrre made e 
second discovery basic to hi; 
process — the ireotment of exposed 
silver plates with mercury vapor. 
The process was a type of develop- 
ment of the silver iodide proc^^ss. 
He named his discovery tlie "Da- 
querreoltype." 

After this discovery, progress 
was made in giant strides. In 1939, 
William Talbot, on English scien- 
tist lecicved credit for discovering 
llic negative-positive principle. Sir 
John Herschcl became intcrcsled 
in the experiments of Daquerrc 
ond Talbot. He began to exper- 
iment at bis laboratory. Out of 
those experiments came tlic im- 
portant discovery of using sodium 
tliiosulfatu. This chemical slops 
the action of light by washing 
away all the silver choride and 
other silvering salts. This "fixing 
technique" is still a standard pro- 
cess in photography using salts 
of silver. Other contributions to 
photography by Herecbul included 
the investigation of the action of 
light on compounds of iron. His 
research in this area led lo the 
process known as the blue-print. 
He also was the first to use the 
word "photography" to describe 
bis work, thus giving tlic 
its name. 



by Pam Teahan and Carol Sowet 

Finally, in 1841, Talbot acci- 

dently stumbled upon the method 

if developing the latent image — 

I process basic to all photographic 

p. By replacing silver chlo- 



ivith : 



the 



iitizing material, he 
fully took pictures with exposures 
short as eight seconds. The im- 
age obtained was a negative, but 
I printed on a sheet of sen- 
sitized paper, he obtained a posi- 
tive. This process was called 
"calotype." 

The calotype became a strong 
competitor lo the daquerreottj-pe, 
mainly because tlie materials were 
cheaper, the apparatus was less 
cumbersome, and processing was 
nmch simpler. However, these li^o 



processes were widely used until 
the invention of the collodion pro- 
cess, introduced in 1851 by Fred- 
erick Archer. 

The men mentioned in this 
article were by no means the only 
people who played a part in the 
dcvelopmeni of photography. Da- 
querres' contribution was impor- 
tant mainly for the stimulus it 
gave to the growth of photo- 
graphy. Talbot made the greater 
contribution with his concept of 
developing the latent image, the 
forerunner of the photogrophic 
systems used today. The photo- 
graphy phenomenon as we know it 
today was the result of many im- 
provements made by many people. 



On Caves and Mastodons 



by Sieve Peltyjohn 
If you are in tlie cafeteria some- 
day and happen to overhear a 
group of students discussing topics 
concerning mastodons, caving, sta- 
lactites, and rocks (not in your 
bead), don't be too surprised. 
You've just stumbled across one 
of the most energetic and enthu- 
siastic groups al l.U.-P-U. — the 
Geology Club. If you stop lo talk 
to tbcm, as I did, there is a good 
clioncc that you will come away 
from the experience convinced 
thot tlicre's no club but Geology 
Club. Besides digging and caving, 
they can talk your ear off ividi 

Although it was formed lo com- 
plenient the formal learning pro- 
cess of those majoring in geology 
and earth science, you don't have 
to be in those areas to be a good 
member. Frank Cebelino is a 
chemistry major, but he's been in- 
volved in the club's activities for 
over a year. Those activities in- 
clude formal and informal caving 
trips by club memhers to south- 
ern Indiana, various types of ex- 
cavations, and study. 

The club's latest project has 
been assisting the Geology Depart- 
ment in the "great mastodon find." 
Geology Club members have been 



ting in tile excavation and 
preservation or the mastodons 
lins. This is one example of 
the close cooperation between the 
Geology Department and the Club. 
Although Dr. Erdtman is the 
official advisor of the club, this 
does not stop the rest of the de- 
partment members from being in- 
volved in club activities- 

The Geology Club has been ac- 
tive in supporting school aclivi' 
ties. Geology Club has been ac- 
tive in Penny Carnival, Harbar- 
arbar Days, and last year's Pover- 
ty Pup Tents Carnival. Club mem- 
bers feel obligated lo support ac- 
livilies that tvill benefit the school. 

The club has good faculty and 
student leadership. The faculty 
members do aU they can to help 
the club without interfering in its 
operations. This year's president, 
Fred Kerr, and Gary Porter (last 
year's president) along with the 
rest of the club's officers (Crcg 
Perry, Vict-President; Shari Bah- 
rke, Secretary; and Becky Will- 
class leaders. They believe that the 
Geology Club can make a positive 
contribution to the university com- 
munity. If you agree, be at their 
next meeting on November 21 at 
4:30 in Room 140.

Purdue Chapter Of 
American Chemical Society 
Cited For Excellence 



Fort Wayne, fndiana— The Pur- 
le University Fort Wayne Chap- 
r of the American Chemical 
Society has been cited for ex- 
cellence for the second lime in 
two yeors. It is one of 86 chap- 
ters out of a total of 518 lo be 
honored by the Society in the 
academic year 19681969. Tlie 
Fort Wayne group was accorded 
similar honors in the 1967-1968 

In a letter lo Purdue President 
Frederick L. Hovde, Dr. J, Trygvc 
Jensen, chairman of the Council 
Committee on Chemical Education 
for ACS, said, "Each year the 
committee reviews the activities of 
each chapter and selects for spe- 
cial commendation those which 
have compiled outstanding records 
during the year ... It is my 
pleasure to inform you tliat tlie 
chapter at Purdue University, 
Fort Wayne, is among this elite 
group of outstanding chapters . - - 
I am certain that you arc as 



proud as we are of the chemistry 
students in the Purdue University 
Chapter and of their advisor (Dr.) 
Sharon Slack." 

In bis reply lo Dr. Jensen, Pre- 
sident Hovde acknowledged the 
commendation and said, "That 
the Fort Wayne Chapter has been 
given special commendation for 
two consecutive years and that it 
la one of 86 selected for this 
honor from the more than 500 
student chapters throughout the 
country have been noted with par- 
ticular gratification. 

By copy of this letter lo Prof. 
Sharon Slack ... I am asking 
lier to convey lo all members of 
the chapter the compliments and 
congratulations of the University 
for the outstanding record the 
chapter has made and best ivishes 
for continued success in the chap- 
ter's efforts to develop attitudes 
of professionalism among students 
interested in chemistry as a car- 
eer," President Hovde added.

Student Mail 
Service Suggested 
By Mrs, Churchill 

Did you ever try to contact a 
student? Talk about frustration! 
Perhaps in the new student union 
building wc will euro this im- 
pediment to contact. 

Mrs. Churchill presented a sug- 
gestion for improving student 
and faculty communication. She 
attended a commuter college in 
Boston in which a type of student 
mail service has worked simply 
and efficiently. A student receives 
and distributes the mail. A list of 
addresses is posted, and the re- 
cipients cross off their names and 
pick up local letters. 

Since we have no student direc- 
tory and no future plans for one 
exists, wc must remedy the present 
crude and inefficient system. Why 
not try this? Circkle K, a service 
club that has created many bene- 
fits for all of us, might be per- 
suaded to accept and deliver mail 
from [he coalroom. Other ideas?

A Recorded Message 



by Tim Fitigerold 

For the hig band fans, the Led 
Zeppelin lake off with their second 
album LED ZEPPELIN II (Allan- 
tic) where their first album 
stopped. LED ZEPPELIN gave 
music an original new mixture 
of songs ranging from blues to 
ballads lo some of the heaviest 
rock yet. The second album is 
more of the same but hardly a 
carbon copy of tlie first. 

Tbo first side begins wilh 
"Wliole Lotta Love," a raw, chant- 
like composition about the school- 
girl from olhum one with inter- 
esting sound effects. "Whot Is 
and What Never Should Be" 
moves from gentle chords lo shat- 
tering deciblcs and is followed by 
a blues-like "Lemon Song." 



"Thank You," a slower, eentimen- 
lal piece, closes out side one. 

Side two opens wilh Zeppelin 
rock at its best, highlighted by 
solo leads hy Jimmy Pago (as 
is mots of the album). 

The fourth song on this side, 
"Moby Dick," is an instrumental 
featuring more of Page's fingers 
and a three minute drum solo. 

As in their first album, the 
Zeppelin finish at the top trith 
a bang-up ending. "Bring It On 
Home" starts and finishes like a 
Slim Harpo classic but breaks 
looso in between ivith music capa- 
ble of knocking over buildings 
when played at maximum volume. 

Although the quality of their 
first album made a follow up a 
last, LED ZEPPELIN II won't 
let many down.

Student Gov't 



It all started at the Student 
Senate meeting held November 4. 
The senators were considering 
various and sundry resolutions, 
bills, and allocations when the 
topic of discussion shifted lo the 
fact that student government was 
powerless to take any action until 
approval had been given by Dean 
Manges. According lo Souder, it 
was decided that a "unity of pur- 
pose is needed to accomplish a 
few goals," A tcsoulion, passed 
several months ago, allcmpled to 
reconstruct the hoards such that 
rather ihan worrying so much 
about equal representation be- 
tween universities, the commillces 
try to scat the best quahfied peo- 
ple who are best suited lo fill the 
positions. The hill received no 
action whatsoever from the deans. 

The Senate decided to take Uie 
initiative and unconstitutionally 
sealed Mike Lamhorne and Don 
Sluckey in "Purdue scats." Ac- 
cording to Souder, "We're taking 
the initiative ourselves rather than 
wailing for someone else to lake 
the initialive and having us pass 
judgement on it." Said Mike

Supreme Court and newly-seated

haven't been done before. We are

lieve to be valid: that we ate one

Clark Kerr Speaks Of Power Struggle 



Bloomington, Ind. — The strug- 
gle for power in American higher 
education today is marked by ihe 
polilica of confrontation on Ihe 
campus, educator Gark Kerr told 
an Indiana University audience 
here Tuesday night (Nov. 4). 

In the fourth of his five Patten 
Foundation lectures. Dr. Kerr 
said, "Quiet persuasion about in- 
tcresls has given away lo public 
confrontation over principles." 
This, he added, has brought many 
actors to the stage to denounce 
each other — students, faculty, ad- 
ministrators, trustees, and poli- 
ticians in the surrounding com- 
munity. 

What has brought about this 
loss of consensus on campus? Dr. 
Kerr made these coramenis: 

"The division on campus is due, 
in part, to n divided society. Func- 
tions of the university have be- 
come more complex and have 
brought conflict which has made 
governance of the university mote 
difficult. 

"As more public money is spent 
on higher education, society has 
demanded mote control over the 
campus. Federal and slate gov- 
ernments have ihcir say in gov- 
ernance of the campus, and some 
local neighborhoods claim a right 
to participate in the operation of 
the campus." 

Dr. Kerr described the tradi- 
tional approach lo governance of 
American colleges and universities 
and said this system is being chal- 
lenged. He suggested that gover- 
nance of the campus be related to 
functions. He listed Oiese ways in 
which governance of the campus 
can be improved: 

— Functions should he clarified 
lo assure that only the compatible 
and useful are retained. 

— Advisory councils should be 
established, with membership 
drawn from important segments 
of the entire community. 

— Introduce students into de- 



cision making bodies where the 
students have interest and com- 
petence. 

— Strengthen student govern, 
men Is to provide an effective 
mechanism for representing llie 
majority of students. 

— Retain corporate political 
neutrality on polilica] issues, and 
faculty appointments, 

— Acceptance, where ihcy have 
suhslantiai support, of "staff asso- 
ciations" in the British pattern, 
ivitli a limited range of interests 
in salaries and conditions, with- 
out reducing the authority of 
academic senates. 

Dr. Kerr also thinks the author- 
ity of the college president should 
be retained and, in some situa- 
tions, increased. Calling this a 
time for substantial change and 
executive leadership. Dr. Kerr 
pointed out: 

"Presidents need a new style. 
They will need lo be more visible 
to the campus public and more 
oriented toward the internal poli- 
tics of the campus. There should 
be less orientation toward exter 
nal contacts and administrative 
affairs. He (the college president) 
should he more like a mayor and

Concerning campus dissent, 
confrontation, and other problems 
that call for urgent action. Dr. 
Kerr said:

"The 

for fast and cor 
needed through some form of a 
smaU eseeulive council for the 
campus which has faculty and 
student members as well as ad- 
ministrative members. The cam- 
pus of today has a surplus of nega- 
live power with all its veto groups. 
It needs more positive authority." 

Dr. Kerr said the campus must 
turn its back on violence and must 
act against coercive minorities. 
This requires quick academic pen- 



alties, as well as support of the 
general law, he pointed out. 

Other changes recommended by 
Dr. Kerr included: 

—Diversion of more faculty 
and other resources toward t)ic 
undergraduate, and particularly 
the lower division student. 

—The creation of the maximum 
number of options for students 
througti diverse "cluster colleges," 
academic programs, and living 
arrangements. No one type of 
campus, or program, or style of 
community life is clearly superior 
for all students in all places at 

— Give greater attention lo the 
issues of campus size, rate of 
growth, and internal structure so 
that size will not be excessive and 
rate of growth not too traumatic. 
The internal structure should not 
he monoUthic. 

Dr. Kerr recommends that a 
line be clearly drawn as to when 
the government may properly in- 
tervene on the campus and when 
it may not. The American Asso- 
ciation of University Professors 
and the American Civil Liberties 
Union drew lines around academic 
freedom, he said, and added that 
similar lines are now necessary 
around campus integrity. 

These suggestions. Dr. Kerr 
said, may be helpful in improving 
governance on campus, but they 
will not assure tranquility on the 

"The campuses which attract 
'troublesome' students irill con- 
tinue to have* the most trouble, 
and belter governance will not 
stop the tendency for trouble," 
Dr. Kerr Said. "It may make 
trouble easier to handle once it 

"Better governance may make it 
possible to act more quickly and 
with more support from the gen- 
eral campus. It may also make 
it easier lo resist outside inter- 



Centennial Marker To Open In 2069 



West Lafayette, Ind.— Some- 
time in January, a copper box will 
be sealed, quietly inserted into a 
rcctongular slot in the base of 
Purdue University's new Centen- 
nial Marker and covered with con- 

The bos will contain Purdue's 
personal messages lo a generation 
yet to be born. 

While all of the materials have 
not yet been selected tor Purdue's 
time capsule, scheduled to he op- 
ened in the university's bicenten- 
nial faculty and students will 

— A message from President 
Frederick I. Hovdc to Purdue 
president of 2069. 

— A message from a faculty 
representative lo the faculty of 
Purdue in 2069. 

— A mcssogc from a student rep- 
resentative to the student body 
of 2069. 

— A message from an alumni 
representative lo a 2069 alumnus. 

— Memorabilia of Purdue's cen- 
tennial year and olher items con- 
veying the historical and cultural 
milieu at 1969 (incliiding ma- 



terials and publications on the 
moon landing) and national, slate 
and local newspapers. 

Also to be included will be a 
centennial souvenir cup, a cen- 
tennial flag, photos — but no movie 
film. 

"We cannot be sure ihat movie 
film of today would be of any 
value after 100 years," explains 
L. 0. Nelson, administrative dean 
for student services and continu- 
ing education. Regional Campus 
Administration, Nelson is vice 
chairman of the Centennial Year 
Policy Committee and heads a 
subcommittee an the time capsule. 

"We still arc open to sugges- 
tions for the capsule," Nelson says, 
"but we are going to have to act 
swiftly." 

While there is some favor for 
sealing the time capsule before 
the end of tlie year. Nelson says 
his committee has taken the alti- 
tude that there could occur on 
event of significance before the 
included, hence "we'll wait until 
end of the year that should be 
after Dee. 31 — though no date has 
been set." 



Tfae copper capsule itself is a 
9 X 12 X 24 inches and, after the 
materials are placed in it, will be 
permanently (for 100 years, that 
is) sealed. It will be placed in the 
one-Ion concrete base of the mark- 
er and three steel bars dropped 
into grooves along the sides of 
the valut. On lop of the bars 
goes a small piece of plywood. 
The remainder of the opening will 
be filled with concrete and capped 
with a canted limestone block, to 
which will be affixed a stainless 
steel plate, inscribed with proper 
labels and the notation, "To he 
opened in Purdue's bicentenial 
year 2069." 

Committee members hope 2069 
Purdue people will know how lo 
open il- 

Of cour^, that challenge is 
really not as tough as the one 
President Hovde, the faculty mem- 
ber, the student and the alumnus 
will have: What meaningful thing 
can you say for your counterparts 
100 years hence? 

Sit down with pencil and paper 
sometime and try ihat assignment 
yourself.
