The Media-Military Merger 



The New York Times 
accuses United Tech- 
nologies Corporation 
of conflicting interests, 
but can its corporate 
board withstand the 
same scrutiny? 



By Douglas Schmidt

United Technologies Corpo- 
ration lUTX) has placed an offer to 
buy Diebold, Inc. for S2.63 billion. 
.The offer has proven to be highly 
controversial, as UTX is a military 
contractor and Diebold manufac- 
tures voting machines. Diebold 
rejected UTX's offer but, if UTX 
increases its bid, the sale could 
slill be made. The potential 
conflict of interest alarms 
many, including the editor 
of the New York Times. How- 
ever, The New York Times 
(Company is hardly im- 
mune to conflicting inter- 
ests. 

Shortly after the 
bid was announced, the | 
editors of the New York 
Tmies published a piece 
entitled "A new role 
for defense contrac- 
tors?: Counting votes"

The editors said that, 
as UTX is a leading de- 
fense contractor, "it has 
an enormous corporate 
interest in who gets 
elected President." The 
editors mention Eisen- 
hower's familiar warn- 
ing about the influence 
of the military-indus- 
trial complex and that 
"Eisenhower would be 
appalled to learn tliat

William E. Ken- 
nard was elected to the 
Board of Directors of 
The New York Times 
Company in 2001. Cur- 
rently, he is the chair of 
the company's nomi- 
nating and governance 
committee and a mem-

mittee. These positions

Certainly, this 
is a legitimate concern. 
However, the news me- 
dia also has a powerful 
influence on the way

Kennard is also 
the managing director 
of The Carlyle Group, a 
private equity firm with 



billions invested in the 
aerospace and defense 
industries. The Carlyle 
Group also has invest- 
ments in real estate 
which will be affected 
by the next president's 
handling of the sub- 
prime lending crisis. 
Finally, according to an 
article in the Washing- 
ton Post, 7.5 percent 
of The Carlyle Group is 
owned by the govern- 
ment of Abu Dhabi, the 
capital of the United 
Arab Emirates. Abu 
Dhabi is just 860 miles 
from Baghdad, about 
the distance from Fort 
Wayne to Oklahoma 
City, lis proximity 
alone would give it an 
interest in the out- 
come of the war. 

In 2004. the edi- 
tors of the Times pub- 
lished a piece saying 
that the paper's cover- 
age of "the prelude to 
war and into the early 
stages of the occupa-

A study con- 
ducted by Harvard Uni- 
versity last year showed 
that only 34 percent 
of Americans trust the 
media's coverage of the 
presidential campaign 
and 83 percent think 
that corporations have 
too much influence 
over what the media re- 
ports. Similarly, a new 
poll by Harris Interac- 
tive shows that only 30 
percent of Americans 
"tend to trust the press," 
If the media is to regain 
this lost trust, it will first 
have to address these 
serious conflicts of in- 
terests.

Will GINA make you sick? 

House passes Genetic Information 



Nondiscrimination Act 




In 1997. Ethan Hawke 
and Uma Thurman 
starred in a film called 
Gattaca. Gattaca 

portrayed a near-future 
society obsessed wiih a 
new form of eugenics. 
Genetic information is 
used to create separate 
classes of people, a 
wealthy, genetically 

"superior" upper class, 
and a disadvantaged, 
genetically "inferior" 
lower class. 

Apparently, members 
of the House are 
concerned that what was 
once science fiction may 
soon become 



orher car being stolen. In 
this case, it would make 
perfect sense to charge 
each person exactly the 
samepremium. However, 
in the real world, not 
everyone faces the 
same risk. Safe people 
essentially subsidize 
risky people. This creates 
a problem called "adverse 
selection." 

According to http:// 
www.economisl.com, 
"adverse selection" is 
when "people who know 
they have a higher risk 
of claiming than the

To avoid thissituation. 
insurance companies 
can keep track of bee 
populations so that 
they can charge higher 
premiums to residents 
of high risk areas. This 
decreases the profit

increases the number of 
safe customers who buy 
insurance.

Home of the 

Buzzard Lop 



by ZACHARY HORNBACK 

honizli01@ipftv.cdu 



Spring Break is of- 
ten the time for crazy 
partying; booze, club- 
bing, fun, sun, surf and 
turf. But no experience 
quite matches one that 
can be found every 
Sunday afternoon in 
Goodland, Florida at 
Stan's. 

Stan's is, the majority 
of the 




water- ^ ., 
front, 

with a dock for those 
wishing to arrive in 
less than conventional 
ways. It has a wide- 
open area right in front 



of the bar littered with 
tables shaded by um- 
brellas and surround- 
ed by chairs. There are 
manyopen-airporches 
with seating and shel- 
ter in the back, and to 
the left of the restau- 
rant is another build- 
ing - The Island Woman, 
a tourist shop contain- 
ing the most interest- 
ing assortment of hats, 
shirts and handcrafted 
sunglasses. In between 
the two 
build-

is the 
stage 
and 
dance 
floor, 
shaded 
by a 
large 
overhang with a huge 
metal buzzard on top 
overlooking the gravel 
party ground. 

On Sundays the 



place is filled to the 
brim. The best way 
to describe Stan's on 
Sundays is by first 
equating it with a par- 
tj' - a block party, or 
some other neighbor- 
hood function where 
everyone comes out to 
sit back, enjoy the day 
and have a few drinks. 
On Sundays it is home 
to tourists and the res- 
idents of both Good- 
land and nearby Mar- 
co Island. The people 
fill the restaurant and

the tables and chairs 
scattered between 
Stan's and The Island 
Woman. Some bring 
their own chairs to sit 
in. and on busy days 
its even been known to 
be hard to find stand- 
ing room. At noon, ihf 
reason for so many 
people is confusing, 
as there doesn't seem 
to be anything going 
on. Everyone is sim- 
ply eating, drinking, 
laughing and cavort- 
ing about. 

Soon the reason for 
such a crowd becomes 
clear. Stan takes to 
the stage, a portly tan 
man with a white goa- 
tee and strange fishing 
hat. Me begins with 
a few offensive jokes 
that make even the 
staunchest of patrons 
grin, and then asks 
everyone to stand for 
the national anthem. 
Naturally, this version 
of "The Star-spangled 
Banner" lasts sue and a 
half minutes. He then 
introduces the band. 
They play two sets be- 
fore Stan takes to stage 
again, an hour and a 
half later. He begins by 
announcing birthdays 
and may follow these 
up by a special shout 
out to any who exhibit 
particularly patriotic 
spirit. This is followed 



by Stan's own comedic scathed. Contrary to

taking tips as he asks 
members of the audi- 
ence where they hail 
from. Before too long 
the raucous song ends 
and another begins. 

The end of Stan's 
show is a song: The 
Buzzard Lope. Here 
a witchy old woman 
named Mary sways 
along onstage call- 
ing women of ail ages 
up to join her. The 
group, led by the large 
crone in front, begins 
the buzzard lope - a 
strange dance consist- 
ing of many sudden 
moves appearing to 
have more to do with 
the lyrics of the song, 
sung by Stan, than the 
music being played 
by the band. Hilarity 
ensues as the grand 
finale comes followed 
by a bow of all those 
involved in the spec- 
tacle. Tourists then 
shortly overrun the old 
hag, a local celebrity, 
as the band begins to 
play on through the 
lazy afternoon. 

Sundays are spent 
best at Stan's. If you 
should ever find your- 
self in Marco Island, 
Florida on a Sunday 
ahernoon. go to Stan's. 
It's the most fun to be 
had on a lazy Sunday 
afternoon.

Columbia Street West: 
Sophisticated Indulgence 



by DOUGLAS NOBLE 

noblddOl^lpftv.edu 



Columbia Street 
West is a Fort Wayne 
bar located on the cor- 
ner of Columbia and 
Harrison Street. This 
downtow/n bar has 
been a hallmark of the 
Fort Wayne scene for 
more than 50 years. 
Colombia Street is 
a three-story brick 
building that is nearly 
a century old. The an- 
cient brick gives the 
bar a slightly urban 
look and a sophisti- 
cation that is some- 
times lacking in the 
architecture of newer 
establishments. The 
building may be old 
but the scene inside is 
anything but. 

I went to Columbia 
Street on a Saturday 
night to see what it 
had to offer. I rolled 
up to the bar at about 
10 p.m. Based on the 
size of the group of 



smokers freezing on 
the outdoor patio I 
estimated that it was 
pretty crowded inside. 
I passed the shiver- 
ing huddle and went 
through a swinging 
wooden door where I 
was greeted by a huge 
doorman in a small 
t-shirt. After paying 
the three dollar cover 
and getting my hand 
stamped with a smiley 
face, I made my way to 
the front bar. 
The front bar at Co- 
lombia Street is domi- 
nated by a massive 
wooden bar that on 
a Saturjiay night is 
invariably packed with 
booze-hounds wran- 
gling for a drink. If 
you come to Colombia 
Street on a Saturday 
night be prepared to 
work for your cocktail. 
Yelling over the throng 
I managed to order a 
drink as I observed a 
huge plate of shots be- 
ing served to a group 
of college age partiers. 
The typical late-night 



weekend crowd at Co- 
lumbia Street is rela- 
tively young, casually 
dressed and at least 
one drink over the 
limit. The atmosphere 
is predictably loose, 
if you are looking to 
meet someone you 
don't have to look far 
for a friendly face. 

Over the din I could 
hear the distinctive 
sound of live rock mu- 
sic so I made my way 
to the back bar to see 
what was up. The 

back bar is an expanse 
of open dance floor, 
raised sections of 
floors with tables, and 
of course, thebackbar. 
This is where people 
go to dance, listen to 
the live music, and in 
general, get crazy. The 
back bar, like the front, 
is packed with bodirs 
and the bar tc^dl.■^^. 
mix and pour furious- 
ly to keep up with iIil' 
demand. 

Columbia Slrci-t 
West is an ideal place 
to blow off some 



steam and to forget 
about those exams for 
awhile. It may not be 
ideal for a date, but 
if you are looking for 
a ivild night out on 



the town, Columbia 
Street's classic style, 
central location and 
multitudes of unin- 
hibited patrons make 
it a sure winner.

Left behind? Perspective from a 
lefty in a right-handed world 



By MELISSA AKASON 

AkaimaOieipfw.cdu 



Are you left-handed? 
If you are then you will 
understand this article 
very well. If not, this ar- 
ticle will not affect you. 
Perhaps you may at least 
notice the injustice that 
is placed on left-handed 
people. 

Some very famous 
people are left-handed, 
like Morgan Freeman. 
Dennis Quaid. Bruce 
Willis, ChoobakaWookie, 
Michelangelo Buonaroti, 
Leonardo Da Vinci, Drew 
Barrymore, Whoopi 

Goldberg, Goldie Ha\vTi, 
Diane Keaton, Nicole 
Kidman, Oprah Winfrey, 
Aristotle, Prince William, 
King George II, King 
George IV, King George 
VI, Queen Mother. Bob 
Dole. Joan of Arc. Helen 
Keller, Kurt Cobain, Emi- 
nem, and Ringo Star, just 



to name a few. 

Wiih such a great num- 
ber of powerfitl people, 
one would assume the 
world catered to all peo- 
ple regardless of hand 
dominance, especially 
when ten to 15 percent of 
the population are leftys. 
Yet that is not the case. 
Everyivhere left-handers 
find that there is no place 
for them unless they 
are willing to accept the 
righl-hand ways. 

You would tbink that 
this is not a problem un- 
less you are left-handed. 
But when the classroom 
doors open and the stu- 
dents pile in, the leftys 
are stuck with desks 
that are not designed for 
them, but are designed 
perfectly for right-hand- 
ers. 

This may not be an is- 
sue to all the right-hand- 
ers, and it may seem that 
there is no need to ad- 
dress it. However, there 
are many reasons to ad- 



dress it because lefrys 
pay the same tuition as 
rightys. Have we come to 
a place where thecomfort 
of the minority is disre- 
garded and passed off as 
ridiculous or not worth 
a single thought? How is 
it that simple things like 
one's ability lo live com- 
fortably, or better yet to 
learn comfortably, can 
be taken forgranted? 

Accommodating to 
leftys could result in an 
improvement in grades. 
How can a person study 
and concentrate when 
they are uncomfortable 
in their desk? There are 
a great number of stud- 
ies that prove a person's 
comfort while they are 
sludging affects their 
concentration abilities. 

Even when a desk is re- 
quested, there is not one 
to give. What can one 
person do but 'beg the 
question'... can we ever 
be equal in a world that 
is undoubtedly unequal?

LiberJan students teach Americans value of education 



By LOUISA DANIEL50N 

danifa02eipEw.cdu 



Whal was the firai 
hook you ever read? 
Board book, picture book 
or historic tome - you 
probably don't remem- 
ber exacdy which one it 
was. But you know that 
it was important because 
you learned to read. 

Travel to Liberia. In 
this land, recently heal* 
ing from civil warfare, 
chUdren are learning to 
read and the Liberian 
Children's Ministry is 
helping. 

The Ministry was 
begun by loe Bo way in 
2004. Originally from Li- 
beria, Boway came to the 
United States to attend 
college in 1990. 

The Ministry has 
started ten church-affili- 
ated schools that teach 
e\'eryihing from kinder- 
garten through sixth or 
ninth grade. 

The youngest stu- 
dents begin attending 
school at age sLx or seven, 
but there is no upper age 



limit on students. 

"We do not have an 
age limit with the older 
ones - as long as you 
want to come and leam, 
we accept you,'" said Bo- 
way. 

Only one school pro- 
vides education through 
ninth grade; all nine oth- 
er schools end with sixth 
grade. 

During a school day, 
students will come at 
Bam and stay until 1 lam 
(for kindergarteners) or 
1 pm (for everyone else). 
Fifty-seven instructors 
teach everything from 



0^ 



math to grammar in sin- 
gle-building schools. 

"We cover everything 
required for elementary 
schools in Liberia," Bo- 
way noted. 

Students travel up to 
half an hour by foot to 
reach school ever^' day. 
They come from farms, 
where their parents raise 
rice. 

"If they have a long 
walk, then we try to (cre- 
ate) a school in that loca- 
tion," Boway said. 

Semesters last from 
early September to the 
first week of February 
and from the sec- 
ond week of Feb- 
ruary to the sec- 
ond week of July. 
During the "sum- 
mer break' kids 
stay at home ivith 
their parents and 
help out or travel 
) to their grandpar- 
ent's places. 
When students 
graduate, they 
hold a program 
with a play by 
the drama team, 
a guesl speaker, 
and the hand- 
ing out of report 




they 
have fin- 
ished school, they return 
to the farm to help their 
parents. 

Only about ten per- 
cent of graduates con- 
tinue on to higher educa- 
tion. 

TXvo or three limes 
per year, Boway trav- 
els back to Liberia to do 
teacher training, substi- 
tute teach, and distrib- 
ute donated supplies like 
textbooks, clothing and 
reading books. 

During teacher train- 
ing sessions, Boway says 
"We learn different skills 
in teaching and organiz- 
ing the program to ef- 
fectively meet the needs 
of the children." Of the 
donations, Boway said 
that the greatest need is 



for children's books with 
pictures. 

"They do not speak 
English," he said. "(But) 
they love those books." 
The students learn Eng- 
lish in school, and see- 
ing the pictures in the 
books connects the story 
for them when the words 
do not. Boway receives 
everything from math, 
English and science text 
books to beginner read- 
ers and stories for 6-7th 
graders at his donation 
site, New Life Lutheran 
Church on 2424 South 
Coliseum Boulevard in 
Ft. Wayne. 

For each donation 
received, "1 have to go 
through all the material 
and find out which is us- 



able," Boway said. 

He does not take his- 
lon' books, since African 
tiistorj' is different from 
American history. 

He also avoids taking 
markers and glue sticks, 
as anything liquid will 
dry out in the arid cli- 
mate of Liberia. 

Boway also travels 
throughout the United 
States to speak at schools 
and churches about his 
mission program. Since 
he started the Ministry, 
he has traveled thou- 
sands of miles per year in 
both inter and intra-con- 
tinental travel. 

His mfe and two- 
and-a-half year old son 
accompany him on jour- 
neys throughout the U.S., 
but they do not travel to 
Africa because of all the 
shots their son woiJd 
have to get. 

"He's a pretty good 
traveler," Boway said of 
Joe Jr.

IPFVU versus Butler - Today 



'mm 




wins was one over Kent State and 
the Mastodons held an early lead 
over Wisconsin before foul trouble 
and cold shooting doomed the 
senior laden team. 

The program must now say 
goodbye to Johnson, DeWitt Scotl, 
Pat Lepper, Chris Perkins, Armend 
Ademi and laraun Burrows, an all- 
conference second team selection. 
A seventh senior, Zeljko Egeric left 
the team earlier in the season for 
unspecified reasons. The seven 
made up 57 percent of the team's 
minutes, scoring and rebounding. 
They also totalled half of the 
Mastodon's learn steals and 64 
percent of the team's assists. 
Filling that void could be tough for 
the Mastodons, who have to find 
solace in the fact that ihey were 
led in scoring by underclassmen 
in seven of their last eight games. 

Those underclassmen, juniors 
Da\'id Carson and Jakari Johnson 



and freshman Ben Botts, are 
all virtual locks for the starting 
lineup in a year. The team will 
return three other players, but 
only Zach Plackemeier had 
significant playing time of those 
three. TVansfers Aaron Richie and 
Delivez Yearby will also be eligible 
to play as juniors. 

Recruiting wise, IPFW has 
signed 6'U" TVey McCorkle of 
Bismarck, Illinois, who will help 
IPFW on the enterior, probably 
pretty early. Of the three players 
6'7" or taller who return, just one 
is strictly a forward and not listed 
as a guard and forward. McCorkle 
will be the tallest player in IPFW's 
Division 1 history, matching Eric 
Bergstrom, who played very littie 
as a freshman before transferring 
to a smaller school. McCorkle was 
All-State in Illinois as a junior 

IPFW's only other commitment 
is lohn Peckinpaugh, a small 



forward from Muncie Central, 
the school that produced Botts. 
Scout.com also lists Courtney 
Belger, a G'2" point guard from 
University City, Missouri as a 
player considering IPFW. Fife is 
stilMooking to land a local recruit, 
while fellow league team UMKC 
recendy locked up their second 
Fort Wayne player in Fred Ford 
from South Side High School. 

Oakland has the conference's 
only 3-star recruit, on a 5-star 
scale, DrewMaynard. 

Recruiting aside, Fife will need 
to spend the off months preparing 
some of his untested players 
and make sure that McCorkle or 
freshman Nick LuireU are ready 
to contribute bigtime inside at the 
spot that Burrows leaves vacant. 
If he can do that next year, IPFW 
may just not only eclipse their Dl 
win record again, but be a serious 
contender in the Summit League.

Progress continues for Fife and Co 



i Burrows' All-Conference nod, opening round victory bring 
^^?more enthusiasm, higher expectations for future of program 

By DAN VANCE 

dan-vantoWfrancJi liepuhlicsnontntt 



Last Sunday, Mastodon nation celebrated. After 
four years of courting a conference, a year of waiting 
in the Independents and a solid debut season, coacli 
Dane Fife had lalcen the Mastodons to a post season 
viaory with a 66-62 battle against Southern Utah. 
The next day, any ideas of a Cinderella slipper fitting 
the big foot of a 'Don came crashing down as Oral 
Roberts imposed their ivill late to win 58-42 in the 
Semi-Finals of the Summit League Tournament. 

After towering over the Golden Eagles for the 
majority of the game. IPFW did no t eicacdy fall apart at 
the seams, but was unable to stage off a late shooting 
rally. And with such, the sixth year of Division 1, third 
of Dane Fife and first in the Summit League came to 
an abrupt ending. 

"We had id play great basketball to beat Oral 
Roberts." Fife told the Tblsa World. "We did not play 
great, 1 don't thinic the wheels fell off. It was much 
closer than the score indicated." 

Despite the dissapointing loss to the NCAA 
Tournament qualifier, ii was strong run and finish 
for the Mastodons. On the verge of a three seed in 
the conference tournament, the Mastodons dropped 
back to fifth after a three game losing steak to end 
the season. Tvvo of those losses came in overtime 
contests. 

Although they won in round one and came

oh-so close to advancing to the Summit finals, 
winning just one of their last five games was a critical 
dissapointment for a team that showed progress 
under the Fife administration for the third straight 
season. For their first year in the league, IPFW went 
9-9 and beat everyone except the top two teams; 
ORU and JUPUI. Included in that run were a pair of 
conference opening wins and taking both games from 
the third ranked Oakland Grizzlies. Balanced scoring 



helped IPFW all year, especially in -conference. Four 
Mastodons averaged double-digit scoring and a fifth, 
Demetrius lohnson, was just over eight points per 
game. 

13 also marked a new Division I record total for the 
school, something that it has accomplished aUihree 
years under Fife. Included in the non-conference
