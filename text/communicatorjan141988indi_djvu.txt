Solution perplexing 

Campus color dilemma continues 



IPFW students, administrators, 
faculty and staff voted 275 to 241 last 
semester lo choose blue and while 
over crimson and gold as IPFW's 
school colors. 



"This has been a fun 
issue in many ways. " 



That vote, however, carries no 
weight. According lo Purdue Presi- 
dent Steven C. Beering, IPFW can use 
the biue and white for the athletic 
teams but for official colors. IPFW 
must show representation of Indiana 
and Purdue Universities, 



The athletic department can use 
blue and white because IPFW has its 
own athletic teams, independent of lU- 
Gloomington and Purdue-West 
Lafayette. According to Judith M, 
Clinton, executive director of univer- 
sity relations at IPFW, colors repre- 
senting the parent universities would 
be used [or official university doc- 
uments, such as Uie Bulletin, and 
functions, such as commencement 



Campus Minislry expanded its staff 
last semester lo include Sister 
Patricia Huffman, a Catholic campus 
minister, to belter serve Catholic 
students at IPFW. 




Sister Palty, a representative of Ihe 
Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend, 
divides her lime between IPFW and 
the Indiana Institute of Technology. 

"The diocese has a thrust of, at this 
point in time, getting a Catholic pres- 
ence on all universities so that there is 
some Catholic focus on all the state. 
private and Catholic universities," 
Sister Patty explained, "I'm here 
primarily for Cathohc students," 

IPFW, according to Sister Pally, is 
a unique case: a campus ministry 
program was already esUblished with 
the Reverend Margaret McCray- 
Worrallalthehelm, 

Catholic students prior lo this 
semester were generally referred to 
Father Larry Kramer, the represent- 
ative to all campuses in this diocese. 

Sister Patty was hired by Bishop 
John D'Arcy, through the diocese of- 
ficial office of campus minislry, lo 
begin duties in August of 1937. 

A daughter of Charity of St. Vincent 
de Paul, Sister Patty was born and 
raised in Pensacola. Florida, She en- 
tered the convent in Evansville, In- 
diana, then attended nursing school in 
Milwaukee. Wisconsin, where she 
received a bachelor's degree in 
nursing. 

Sister Pally, a former director of 
Ihe Home Heath Care and Hospice for 
SI. Vincent Stress Center in In- 
dianapolis, is currently working on a 
master's degree in Christian spirit- 
uality at Creighton Universily. 

Sister Patty is interested in cul- 
tivating the Catholic student at IPFW. 
"What I've been trying to do is get 



tent to have two diricrcnt sels of col- 
ors. We have to abide by the referen- 
dum, but by Ihe same token we have 
lo abide by President Beering's deci- 
sion. This puts us between a rock and 
a hard place. 

"I would like to know if we did have 
approval from President Beering to 
start a process for the selection of 
school colors and if we never had that 



approval, one would think the 
referendum would be null and void," 
Gregory stated. 

According to Clinton, the objective 
of the referendum was to clarify what 
colors IPPW should use. She said the 
process was useful in that sense, 
"This has been a fun issue in many 
ways,, a much larger issue than many 
of us ever anticipated." 



Clinton said it would be Uie admin- 
istration's discretion to select colors 
tor other universily publications. 
"Athletics can use blue and white and 
we now know the parameters in pub- 
lications. We can work with the situa- 
tion as it is. I would hope we can go on 
from here lo other things." 

Students' Government President 
Kurt Gregory said, "We are trying to 
figure out what we should do about the 
school colors. We think it is inconsis- 



Ministry welcomes 
new member to staff 



student input-lhings students would 
like to do socially," she said. 

She has also sent a questionnaire to 
members of the faculty requesting 
input after a request prompted the 
survey: "One member of the facully 
asked if it were ever possible lo have 
mass or something for the faculty lo 
gel together," 

The response lo the questionnaire, 
which asked about the feasibility and 
creation of a campus mass among 
other questions, has been good. Sister 
Pally stated. The majority of faculty 
members responding have offered 
suggestions for more activities held in 
conjunction with other organizations, 
"something we've tried lo do," Sister 
Pally said. 

"The hardest thing about Campus 
Ministry on this campus is thai so 
many people are here part lime, or if 
they're here full lime, have outside 
jobs," Sister Palty explained, 

"Primarily whal we're doing now. 
what I've been doing this first semes- 
ter, is trying to meet people, find out 
what their interests are, and partici- 
pating in current activities, 

"People I've met out here have l&gt;een 
very open, honest and receptive." 

Sister Patty works closely with the 
local churches, meeting with pastors 
and youth pastors from local parishes 
for advice on "what they thitik we 
could or should be doing for college 
students and lo see what they're 
offering." 

Counseling students is a primary 
job. Although mostly personal in na- 
ture, some curriculum counseling is 
done. According to Sister Patty, stu- 
dents, faculty, and staff all are wel- 
come at Campus Ministry, although 
students are the majority. "Some- 
times people just need someone to talk 
to." she explained. 

College years. Sister Pally ex- 
plained, are "a time of looking at 
things in a different lighl-testing for 
values and searching for values,,.I 
think Campus Ministry has a role in 
that -not a dictatorial role-but in pre- 
senting values and attitudes for people 
to discover themselves," 

Campus Ministry goals for the new 
year include an abundance of ac- 
tivities, including a retreat the week- 
end of April 15 and 16, lo the Linden- 
wood Retreat Center near Plymouth, 
Ind.; a trip lo Appalachia during 
spring break; and a ski trip Ihe 
weekend of Jan. 29 and 30. 

"I'd hke to see us do more social 
and service activities in Ihe 
community," Sister Pally stated, 

"II anybody has any suggestions to 
Campus Ministry, we're here five 
days a week." she concludes. Ap- 
pointments can be made, but are not 
necessary, by contacting the office of 
campus minislry. in Walb Memorial 
Union suite 234.

Students'' Government 

Objectives outlined 



students' Government accomplished 
much during Its fall '87 sessions and 
expects lo accomplish more during the 
spring. 



"IPFW has Students from 
not only Allen but from sur- 
rounding counties- We 
should be listened to..." 

Tim Smith 

studeni senaio' 



The studeni senate joined the Stale 
Legislative Coordinating Committee 
and has sent senators Tim Smith and 
Kim Teler as delegates. Smith, who is 
also SLCC treasurer, explained the 
organization is composed of student 
representatives from all of Indiana's 
stale-supported institutions of higher 
education. 

"Our organization has three main 
goals," Smith said. "Our first goal Is 
to get the Indiana General Assembly 
to pass a bill limiting tuition costs to 
30 percent of a university's operating 
costs, IPFW stutlenls pay 38 percent 
of the university's operating costs 
through their tuition," Smith stressed 
thai passage would not prevent tuition 
from rising. Tuition would rise with 
increases in a university's operating 
costs. 

Smith said the organization's second 
goal was lo have a student appointed 
to the state Commission of Higher 
Education, "The commission makes 
many of the really important decisions 
that affect students," Smith said, "It 
is really important to have a student 
appointed to that committee." 

The third goal of the SLCC is to 
increase tax deductions for people who 
donate lo higher education. 

Both Smith and Teler attended the 
pro-torma session of the General As- 
sembly and met with area legislators. 



"IPFW has students from not only 
Allen but also surrounding counties. 
We should be listened to down there," 
Smith said. 

Smith is also the chairman of the 
IPFW Independence Committee, es- 
tablished last fall by tlie Student Sen- 
ale. Smith said the committee is now 
working on a survey lo be distributed 
among the students in late January. 
The two-page questionnaire asks stu- 
dents to evaluate the worth of a di- 
ploma of IPFW against one from an 
independent Fori Wayne university as 
well as the importance of cost and 
convenience as factors leading to 
students deciding to enroll al IPFW. 

Smith said the committee is coop- 
erating with the study being done by 
Fort Wayne Future. The committee is 
also studying the effects of in- 
dependence on the University of 
Southern Indiana which was once part 
of the lU system. 

The senate also organized the used 
booksale held in early January, 
Forbes Mcintosh, who introduced the 
legislation authorizing the booksale, 
said over 300 books were received and 
by the end of the sale over S1500 had 
changed hands. 

The other branch of Students' Gov- 
ernment, the Student Acliviiies Board, 
was also active during the fall. Indra 
Matulionis, SAB chairperson, said, 
"I'm very proud of whal we've ac- 
complished last semester. We have 
had a lot of successful programs." 

Matulionis meptioned the Henry Lee 
Summer concert, which drew a record 
5000 attendance; the lecture by CIA 
dissident Ralph McGehee, which SAB 
co-sponsored with three other 
organizations; and the breakfast with 
Santa. 

Matulionis has high hopes for the 
spring semester. Upcoming SAB 
events include Larry Linville's ap- 
pearance at the Grand Wayne Center 
on Jan. 28 and a Hoagland Hayloft 
parly on Feb. 13. Other SAB plans call 
for fund-raising for Ihe disabled and a 
televison show on Channel 21,

The Communicator 



The color conflict: 
Clear battle lines drawn 
in campus controversy 



Unless you've been living under a 
rock for Ihe pasl semester, you 
probably heard somelhing about 
(he color controversy at IPFW The 
local press has played il to the hilt, 
giving IPFW more coverage than il 
has received in months and cer- 
tainly more than Ihe issue may 
have warranted, 

No one expected (he event to 
snowball inio such a subject of 
contention. When rumors surfaced 
last fall that the IPFW athletic de- 
partment had purchased blue and 
white uniforms, (he possibility that 
IPFW administration, Students' 
Government, and faculty senate 
would have to deal with the color 
topic for most of the semester was 
highly unlikely 

Various factions formed to lobby 
for their choice, protesting those 
color combinations which projected 
the look of a "cheap funeral" or a 
"generic university, ' 

Committees discussed Ihe im- 
plications of the issue, and Stu- 
dents' Government, at the request 
of the Faculty Senate, held a ref- 
erendum for faculty, students, and 
staff to select a se( of colors. Blue 



and white won over crimson and 
gold, 275-241 in (he runoff, 

Ul(ima(ely. the issue reached 
Purdue President Steven C. 
Beering who announced that while 
IPFW can use blue and white for 
athletics, the official colors must 
reflect the colors of Indiana and 
Purdue Universities. 

What made the color issue wor- 
thy of such widespread coverage 
and intense debate? One of (he 
reasons the issue became so con- 
troversial was that some perceived 
it as a move to gain independence 
for IPFW Others saw it as a power 
struggle involving the administra- 
tion, faculty, and students. 

Under the guise of selecting uni- 
versity colors were the real issues 
that administrators, faculty, and 
students were facing. The conflicts 
of the universily community were 
mirrored by the various factions of 
the color war. 

To those who didn't bo(her to 
vote, the color controversy prob- 
ably was "much ado about noth- 
ing," To those who actively cam- 
paigned for (heir favorite hues, the 
battle lines were clearly drawn. 



Opportunity is knocking: 
Don't slam the door 



Interviews are being conducted 
lo select a new vice cnancellor of 
academic affairs. The candidates 
are Joanne Lantz, assistant vice 
chancellor. Albert K. Karnig of 
Arizona State University and 
Michael C. Gemignani of the Uni- 
versity of Maine, 

Karnig's interview will be Jan, 14 
at 3:15-4:15 p,m, in room G46 in 
Kettler Hall; and Gemignani's in- 
terview is scheduled for Jan. 28 at 
2:15-3:15 p.m. in rooms lOBA and 
108B in Kettler. 

Students are being encouraged to 
aid in the selection of a new vice 
chancellor and may get involved in 
the interviews themselves by ask- 
ing the candidates questions per- 
taining to their skills and ideals. 

The search is still on for a vice 
chancellor of student services, and 
the administration is planning to 
involve students in that process 
also. 

Unfortunately many students will 
not take this opportunity to be a 
voice in the decision-making that 
will affect the students' lives at 
IPFW. 

The vice chancellor's responsi- 



bilities include working with (he 
department heads concerning what 
classes to offer and possibly es- 
tablishing a core curriculum. These 
responsibilities will affect every 
student's academic life. If one is an 
art major and no ar( courses are 
offered one semester or if one is a 
political science major and is re- 
quired to take sixteen credit hours 
of bioanthropology (he choice of 
vice chancellor of academic affairs 
is very important. 

Hopefully this will not become 
another case of IPFW student ap- 
athy. Decisions such as this are 
very important to the students and 
have a tremendous impact on how 
the university operates. 

With the open invitation offered 
for students to actively participate 
in the interview process, it would 
be a tragedy if an ineffective vice 
chancellor look command. 

A little interest shown in the 
university and its officials would be 
a welcome change for IPFW stu- 
dents So attend at least one inter- 
view and throw a question or two at 
the candidates. At least you will 
have done your part.

Independence should not be considered 



Independence-we've 
tieard Ihat word thrown 
around, but are we really 
heading in that direction? 
Whal i.f really going nn'' 

According to a represent- 
ative from Coopers and 
Lybrand, the study spon- 
sored by the Chamber of 
Commerce is not to study 
the issue of independence 
but IS centered around the 
relationship Ijetween (PFW 
and Ihe community— how 
each can better serve the 
other They have neither 
Ihe lime nor the money to 
pursue the issue of in- 
dependence for IPFW 

Faculty Senate has also 
set up a committee lo study 
this universily and its rela- 
tionships, with more em- 
phasis on Ihe lies between 



IPFW and the two parent 
universities— Purdue and 
Indiana Universily. 

This commillee has set up 
subcommiltees to study 
such areas as IPFW's rela- 
tionship with Ihe commu- 
nity, the faculty, students, 
alumni, fiscal policy, and 
curriculum and programs. 
According lo Frederick 
Kirchotf, who chairs the 
committee, this study is (o 
be objective and will report 
its findings lo the Faculty 
Senate and (he chancellor 
recommending the best 
course of action lo be taken 
by It to become more in- 
dependent or to strengthen 
ties with the main 
campuses. 

So why worry? But we as 
students do need to l&gt;e con- 



cerned, several signals 
have been made by admin- 
istration that could cause 
concern such as the cur- 
rently debated color change 
from crimson and gold to 
process blue and white, the 
subject of privately funded 
dorms, and the fact that all 
of Ihe diplomas granted 
from this university do 
slate Ihat the diplomas 
were awarded at Fort 
Wayne. 

Along with those signs 
there has been some 
grumbling among students 
and faculty that the parent 
schools are preventing re- 
gional campuses from 
broadening the variety of 
degrees offered and from 
adding more graduate 
programs 



Student Senate has set up 
a committee lo take a 
closer look at Ihe subject of 
Independence and to work 
with faculty and adminis- 
tration lo insure that stu- 
dents' needs are not over- 
looked but are given equal 



want lo receive from this 
campus. In order to justly 
represent you and the other 
students we need you to 
seriously take the time t 
fill out the questionnaire 
and let us know your vie 






This committee's goals 
are to both educate the 
students as well as lo form- 
ulate a policy which will be 
presented to faculty and 
administration on behalf of 
the entire student body. 
What we really need now is 
your cooperation. 

Within the next few 
months, Student Senate will

naire which wilt enable us

that red is righl because he

In fad I think it is the only 
color he sees himself. I've 



never seen an angrier man. 
Speaking of colors, did

Color controversy 
provokes response 

To the Editor: 

Having watched for Ihe 
last month the growing 
amount of space devoted in 
the Communicator to the 
school colors issue. 1 feel a 
response is necessary 

A university is an in- 
stitute of higher learning 
and ils newspaper is an 
important reflection of the 
quality of the institute. It 




does not reflect well upon 
either to have as Ihe ongo- 
ing front-page controversy 
a quibble regarding possible 
use of primary and sec- 
ondary colors. Could the 
editors find nothing of 
greater world relevance to 
include in their newspaper'' 
Tangenlially, could those 
students putting up signs all 
over campus find nothing of 
greater significance to 
society to pui up signs 
about? In fact, is there 
nothing of greater im- 
portance for the Student

Welcome home Frank 
MASH actor to appear 



For all of those die-hard 
M'A'S'H fans, lake heed. 
On Thursday. Jan. 28, al 
7;30 p.m.. Larry Linville, 
who porlrayed Major 
Frank Burns from Fori 
Wayne, will appear at the 
Grand Wayne Center 

IPFWs Sludenl Activity 
Board and WPTA-Channel

ance. Tickets are S6 for 
students and Se for gen- 
eral admission. The box 
office at Ihc Grand Wayne 
Center will be open from 
noon to 5 p.m. beginning 
January 25. For more in- 
formation call 481-6612. 

Larry Linville was born 
in Ojai, California. During 
World War II. his family 
relocated to Sacramento 
where he attended both 
grammar and high school 
Linville is a graduate of 
the University of Colorado 
where he majored in 
Aeronautical Engineering, 
Currently, Linville lives 
with his wife, Melissa, in 
Brentwood. California, 

Lin vi lie's first starring 
role on stage was when he 
was in high school per- 
forming as he describes 
"the only male that was 
draftable into the Christ- 
mas Pageant." Under 
Larry's leadership, this 
lurgid drama was trans- 
farmed into something of 
a farce, driving the drama 
teacher from the gym. 
The teacher was not seen 
for days However, the 
evening was successful 
and helped provide fund- 
ing for the inexperienced 
drama department. 

After Linville left the 
University of Colorado, he 
attended the competitive 
auditions for an opening 
with the Royal Academy 
of Dramatic Arts in 
London, He was not only 
'accepted lo the Academy, 



but was also given a 
scholarship. After he 
completed his training, in 
Lendon. Linville returned 
to the U.S. to Join a clas- 
sical repertory company 
for five years niling in 
with appearances with the 
Lakewood Shakespeare 
Festival, Barter Theatre, 
Lorelto-Hilton Center. San 
Diego Shakespeare Festi- 
val. McCarter Theatre at 
Princeton, and many oth- 
ers. His background in the 
classics is vast, and the 
plays too numerous to 
mention. 

Larry's first taste of 
Broadway came as an 
understudy in "In- 
admissible Evidence." 
closely followed by his 
New York debut in 
Eugene O'Neill's '"More 
Stately Mansions." His 
first television experience 
came when he appeared in 
an episode of "Judd for 
the Defease," He also ap- 
peared on "Mannix," 
"Mission Impossible," 
"The FBI." "Bonania," 
and many others. 

After Linville appeared 
in a role on "Room 222," 
producer Gene Reynolds 
offered him the role of 
Major Frank Burns in the 
television production of 
M*A*S'H, Reynolds was 
surprised since in the 
network's view, Larry was 
a heavy, dramatic actor. 
Bui, Reynolds had his 
way, and Linville's por- 
trayal of Frank Burns has 
become a modern comedic 
classic. 

Since M'A*S'H. Linville 
has appeared in such 
television shows as 
"Rockford Files," "Love 
Boat." "Fantasy Island," 
and "Barnaby Jones." He 
has also appeared in the 
NBC series "Grandpa 
Goes to Washington." the 
CBS series "Checking In" 
and "Herbie the Love 
Bug" and the starring role 
in the feature film "School 
Spirit,"

Question: Why should I 
study abroad? 

Answer: There are al 
least Ihree good reasons lo 
make study abroad a part 
of your college education. 
You can learn a foreign 
language at the source, gain 
a global perspective about 
how other people live and 
work and enhance your ca- 
reer opportunities. 

Question: How will study- 
ing abroad help my future 
career plans? 

Answer Most counselors 
and career placement per- 
sonnel agree that a study 
abroad experience helps 
you "sell" yourself lo a fu- 
ture employer. Study 
abroad demonstrates ma- 
turity, interpersonal skills, 
willingness to try something 
new. independence and 
other qualities strongly 
considered^ by potential 
employers.

study abroad programs are 
available-' 

Answer: Literally there 
are thousands of study 
abroad programs in hun- 
dreds of academic disci- 
phnes offered by colleges, 
universities, and private 
organizations. Programs 
range from two- week study 
tours to full year academic 
programs. The most com- 
plete listing of programs is 
contained in "Vacation 
Study Abroad" and 
"Semester and Academic 
Year" books published by 
Ihe Instilule of Inter- 
national Education, B09 
United Nations Plaza, New 
York. NY 10017 

Question; What resources 
are available lo help me 
decide what, where, and 
when lo study abroad** 

Answer; Your very best 
resource may be right on 
your own campus. On many 



campuses there are study 
abroad ( or international ) 
offices which have been 
created lo advise students 
planning to study abroad. 
Your study abroad advisor 
will have all the latest cat- 
alogs, provide information 
or reading materials, travel 
details, and generally help 
you find the program which 
meets your needs. 

Another good source of 
first hand information is a 
quarterly newspaper called 
"Transitions" (IB Hulst 
Road, Amherst. MA 010021 
written by students and 
other travelers who have 
participated in various 
programs. 

A professional organiza- 
tion called NAFSA (Na- 
tional Association For For- 
eign Student Affairs, 1860 
19th Street NW. Wash- 
ington, D.C. 20009) has a 
variety of pamphlets and 
bibliographies of interest to 
students planning lo study 
abroad. 

The American Institute 
For Foreign Study U02 
Greenwich Avenue, 
Greenwich, Connecticut 
06830) offers the widest va- 
riety of study abroad pro- 
grams—more than 100 



academic year op- 
portunities in their college 
catalog.
