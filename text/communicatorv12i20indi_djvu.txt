One-sided educations prompt program 




They study women 



ByJ.G.GRlSWOLD 
StaK Writer 

When Jeonefle Clausen's daughter come 
home from a nursery school field trip lo 
the hospital, her doughler sold she wonted 

"•Why?" aided Jeonolte. 

Her doughler explained she wonted lo 
core ond operofe on sled people. Jeonelle 
told her doughler Thol she would hove lo 
be a doctor it she wonted to oporolo. 

Her daughter sold she could not be o 

"Why?" osfced Jeonelle 

"I'm o girt," replied her doughler. 



This simplistic example, explains 
Jeanette Clausen, coordinator of 1P- 
FW's Women Studies Program, 
illustrates how chilldren and students, 
even those at the college level, are 
affected by their learning. 

"Education for women Is different 
from the education for men," said 
Clausen, an active feminist. She 
claimed that the Women's Studies 
Program is- an alternative to sexist 
education— -education which is male 
oriented. 

Clausen believes that many IPFW 
classes tend to be one sided, only 
dealing with the lives, achievements 
and ideas of men. 

"They neglect to mention women and 
their contribution in history," shesaid. 

"You will always read Charles 
Dickens but you will not very likely 
read Elizabeth Gaskell. a women 
novelist of equal importance from the 
some period," said Cathryn Adamsky, 
instructor in the program and its 
originator. 

"Frequently we are not encouraged 
to think (in regular classes), but in 
Women's Studies, we are," said Lesley 
Raymer, an IPFW student. 

The Women's Studies Program is 
offered as a minor and classes can often 
be applied to fulfill other requirements. 



Snow closes campus 



ByELLIEWOLLMAN 
Staff Writer 

Fort Wayne didn't get buried under 16 
inches of snow as some weather reports 
predicted, but the Feb. 10 winter storm 
did cause IPFW to shut down all 
operations at noon. 

Decisions on closing the campus 
when it snows depend upon whether or 
not the parking lots can be kept clear. 
"We're a commuter campus and the 
lots are vital," said John Carnaghi, 
Vice Chancellor for Financial Affaire. 
, Carnaghi, who makes the final 
•decision on school closings, is kept 
informed on snow removal progress by 
campus grounds personnel. He then 
takes into consideration the parking lot 
situation, weather predictions, and 
student and employee safety before a 
decision is made. — 

A "snow recess" was declared on 
Feb. 10, which means the entire 
campus closed down, as opposed to a 



'snow emergency," when only classes 
are suspended but all buildings stay 
open with employees remaining. 

When either a snow emergency or 
recess is declared, Carnaghi's office 
notifies the Director of University 
Relations who then contacts all media. 
Announcements are carried on radio 
stations WOWO, WMEE, WLYV, 
WEZV-FM, and WIPU-FM. Whenever 
possible, announcements wilt be made 
by 6:30 a.m. for daytime classes and 3 
p.m. for evening classes. Students can 
also call the campus switchboard for 
pre-recorded school closing an- 
nouncements. 

There was some confusion among 
students Wednesday, the day after the 
storm, when at least one local radio 
station announced IPFW to be closed. 

The station, WXKE, not an official 
source of information about IPFW 
closings, announced at a later time that 
IPFW was open forclasses. 



Students 
conquer 

blindness 

By JACKIE WIORA 
Staff Writer 

"There's nothing more de- 
bilitating than a poor self- 
concept." This is the" motto of 
William Grimm, a seventh semester 
student at IPFW. 

He is blind. 

Grimm, who is majoring in 
mathematics and computer science, 
said that apprehension and fear 
were the major problems he had to 
combat when he first began college. 
"I was afraid that I was getting into 
more than I could handle. But now 
I'm fearless. I've learned to be blind 
and feel OK about myself," he said. 

Grimm siareted at IPFW in 1977. 
He was the first blind student to 
attend classes here. At that time 
there were no special programs for 
disabled students. "Some of my 
professors were apprehensive about 
having a blind student in their class. 
They weren't sure how I would 
handle the course," he said. 

By the next semester another 
blind student had enrolled and now, 
five years later, there are 25 visually 
impaired students (eight of them 
totally blind) attending classes on 
campus. 

The most important thing a blind 
student must learn, according to 
Grimm, is lo depend largely upon 
his or her memory. "I tried taking 
braille notes in class," he said, "but 
I couldn't punch out the holes quick 
enough to keep up with the lecture. 
Then I tried recording the whole 
lecture on tape but It took too long lo 
replay each tape and study its 
contents. Now I do without class 
notes. I just pay altention and try lo 
remember all I can when it's time 
for the test." 

At home Grimm uses recorded 
text books to study. He takes notes 
by having two tape recorders on 
hand, one to play the recorded text, 
and the other fitted with a blank tape 
on which he con record specific 
notes. 

He usually takes his tesLs al a 
different lime than the other 
students in his classes. "I have a 
reader who reads the questions out 
loud lo me," Grimm explained. 
"Then I tell him what I think the 
answer is and he writes It down for 




Grimm was blinded in an accident 
in 1974. He described some of the 
problems be went through learning 
to adjust to his handicap. "For the 
first eight or ten months I was angry 
and I felt sorry for myself. I was 19 
at the time and I felt that I was too 
cool to be blind. People treated me 
funny and I was frustrated at not 
being able to get around by myself. 
But finally I realized that you're 
only disabled by your own attitude 
and I developed a positive self- 
concept." 

Even today, though, Grimm is still 
annoyed by the way some people 
treat him. "When I go shopping with 
my wife and I meet someone In the 
store a lot of times the person will 
speak to my wife instead of me. I'll 
ask a question and the person will 
respond to my wife, as if I were deaf 
as well as blind, " he said. 

Blind people are often physically 
limited by their handicap. For this 
reason Grimm thinks it is very 
important to become active in a 
physical sport that doesn't involve 
too much eyesight. Since his ac- 
cident Grimm has taken up judo 
wrestling. He also spends a lot of 
time listening to music, 

"Music is very Important to blind 
people," Grimm said. "I play 
classical guitar and I have a blind 
friend who plays the violin and the 
banjo." 

When asked if he found it easier to 
relate to blind people than lo sighted 
people Grimm laughed. "No," he 
said. "Most of my friends are 
sighted and so Is my wife. I'm not 
really different than any one else. I 
just want to be treated like any other 
person on the street." 



Adamsky developed the program in 
1971 when she felt there was no course 
about the psychology of women 
available. 

Adamsky and Clausen said the 
program is an extension of the feminist 
movement. 

"We are indebted to the Women's 
Movement; without it, we would not 
exist," said Adamsky. 

Today, over 150 students are enrolled 
in the program. One male has com- 
pleted a minor. Proportionally, male 
enrollment in the program is con- 
siderably less than female enrollment. 

The program spans a list of sub- 
jects — comparative literature, English, 
modern foreign language, labor 
studies, history, nursing, philosophy, 
political science, psychology and 
sociology. 

According to Adamsky, Women 
Studies attempts to examine subjects 
witha "feminine perspective." 

"Women should have social, political 
and economic equality," she said. "We 
assume it should be that way, but it is 
not." 

Clausen added that Women Studies 
does not only treat its subjects dif- 
ferently, but it also attempts to help the 
student to understand women. In many 
classes, current issues facing women 
are explored. 



One student taking the Women 
Studies program said these discussions 
of current issues are merely "com- 
plaint sessions." 

Don-is Ellsworth McCullagh, another 
student following the program, 
disagreed. "Women Studies explains 
what women are all about, and this 
helps me live each day as a woman," 

"I hope women who take Women 
Studies would have self-awareness, 
self-worth and be confident of them- 
selves," said Clausen. She added, "We 
want to emphasize that discrimination 
against women still exists today." 

What job opportunities are open to 
students who have minored in the 
program? 

Adamsky said that many students 
who have graduated with a Women's 
Studies minor have reported it useful in 
their work in therapy, marriage 
counseling and other types of social 
work. 

The program not only offers an 
"alternative" in education, it also 
sponsors several lectures and forums 
discussing feminist topics. The 
program cooperates with and helps 
promote local women's organizations 
such as Fort Wayne Feminisls and the 
Fort Wayne Women's Bureau. It also 
coordinates programs with the YWCA.

Center. tPhoto by Rick Papazlan) 

Center nurtures kids 



By CAROL CARNALL 
Staff Writer 

More than a babysitting service, the 
IPFW Child Care Center's goal is to 
provide a nurturing atmosphere for 
children ages six months to 10 years. 
This kind of child care is a welcome 
benefit to many IPFW students and 
faculty members who are parents. 

Linda Manier, a student in the school 
of nursing, drops off her children. 
Andrea and Michael, on her way to 
classes. "If it weren't for the Center, I 
probably wouldn't be in school," 
Manier said of the center at the corner 
of Stellhorn and Hobson roads. Good 
care for children is hard to find, she 
said. 

Manier's enthusiasm is shared by 
other parents and children. "Guess 

Senators cite problems 



what!" are the words six-year-old 
Stewart Logan uses each time he begins 
to tell about what he does at the Center. 
"Guess what! The snow is so cold on my 
hands," he said. 

Stewart, son of Brenda Logan, an 
associate professor of Spanish, was 
Idling about snow placed in a waler 
table for the children. The table similar 
to a sand box only with water was 
provided by funds recently donated by 
the University Women's Club. 

The emphasis at the Center is on 
"what's good for the children," said 
Jeannie Kauffman, coordinator of the 
program. Kauffman spends two-thirds 
of her time with the children, with the 
other third going to scheduling and 
processing necessary paper work.

Many resign 



By JIM CHAPMAN 
Chief Reporter 

Three former members of IPFW's 
Student Senate, among nine who have 
resigned since last November, believe 
that the Student Senate is failing to 
pe»i;rm the key act that makes a 
university organization a Students' 
Government— the execution of basic 
services lo students. _ 

"The Senate is here to perform basic 
student services," said former Senator 
Phil Patcrson. "They are not realistic 
about these things. They treat It like 
national politics. Some Senators are 
playing politics." 

Paterson said that basic services to 
students arc things like sponsoring a 
dance, and such services are what the 
Senate should handle. He believes that 
the Senate has a lack of concern of what 
the students want. 

"All the Senate needs is people who 
want to work," Paterson said. 

Two other former Senators, Scott 
Kuehn and Jeff Sandy, agreed with 
Paterson. 

Kuehn said some Senators are con- 
cerned with maintaining group and 
maintenance functions, which are 
communication, not serving roles. 
"They're playing a game," Kuehn said. 

Sandy believes that the game being 
played is politics, and cites this among 
his reasons for resigning. "A small 
percentage of Senators of the Student 
Senate arc practicing to be 
bureaucrats," said Sandy. "This 
percentage is growing, and it made 
work impossible," 

Besides Paterson, Kuehn and Sandy, 
former Senators Ada Giore, Dwight 
Fish, Ed Snyder, John Brunner, 



Michael Spencer and Bill Allen all have 
resigned. 

Of the former Senators contacted by 
The Communicator (Fiore, Paterson, 
Kuehn and Sandy) all agreed one of the 
major reasons for the resignations is 
time. They said that being a student 
first and a Senalor second was just not 
fitting into their schedules. 

But for Paterson, Kuehn and Sandy, 
the reasons for their resignations went 
much further and deeper than just 
time. 

Besides their feelings that the Senate 
isn't performing basic services to 
students, the three former Senators, 
and current Senator Ellen Engleman, 
agree that SUBOG, the social arm of 
Students' Government and the Student 
Senate, its legislative arm, should be 
merged to form one Students' Govern- 
ment body lo perform all its functions. 

Currently, SUBOG plans all Students' 
Governmenl's social functions, such as 
the weekly movies, guest speakers, 
special events trips. 

The Student Senate now performs 
Students' Government's legislative 
duties including the dispersal of student 
activity fees to various recipients of 
those funds, setting up of student 
services such as carpooling and free 
legal services, and enactment of 
various proposals dealing with student- 
administration relations. 

Those in favor of the merger of the 
Student Senate and SUBOG reel that the 
two organizations make IPFW's 
Students' Government too large and 
that one organization could adequately 
handle the responsibilities with Just as 
much ease, if not more.

Ulmer handles 
problems, ires 



By DARYL S. BRANDT 
Copy Editor 

He takes a sip of coffee and lights 
his pipe. Rocking back in his chair, 
he looks over his calendar of the 
day's events. Behind him are 
several pictures of horses and a 
macramed owl plant hanger which 
contribute to the peacefulness of the 
orange and tan room. 

Before 6 a.m. everything is calm 
in the office of the man in charge of 
the Student Affairs Administration 
at IPFW. But for Dean John P. 
Ulmer the calm may not last long. 

At any moment an angry student 
with a complaint against the school 
might release his frustrations on this 
50-year-old, silver-haired rep- 
resentative of the administration. 

Wilh 27 years of counseling and 
advising experience behind him, 
Ulmer starts his day. Whenstudents 
have a problem, it is his job to help 
them. 

Ulmer, with tinted glasses, hair 
parted down the middle, and a 
joking manner, hardly comes off as 
a sterotyped non-caring official. Nor 
does he come off as a whipping boy. 

"Sometimes it helps to let them 
(students) vent their anger," Ulmer 
said. "When students come in with 
grievances against the system, I 
ascertain what they have done. Then 
I explained the system and inform 
them of what they can do 
procedurally to solve their 
problems. Many times there's a 
fairly high level of frustration and I 
serve as a sympathetic listener," he 
said. 

Ulmer leaned back, rested his arm 
on the back of the chair and ex- 
plained that his role as ombudsman 
involves more than just receiving 
complaints. 

Besides being the court ol last 
resorts for students with problems 
concerning the school, he also serves 
in a referral and counseling 
capacity, he said. 

Sometimes students have 
questions and need to know where 
they can go to get information. Such 
requests are often handled by his 
secretary, Vieki Shaw. Other limes 
students need personal counseling. 
Ulmer said he has helped sludents 
deal with career decisions, 
disillusionment, personal crises and 
financial problems. 

On busy days, Ulmer might 
receive 20 phone calls and see a 
dozen people. Generally he doesn't 
eat lunch unless it's a business 
luncheon. On less busy days he 
might slop in at the campus 
cafeteria for a bowl of soup. 

Afler lunch he might be called 
upon to fulfill responsibilities apart 
from his duties as ombudsman. 

"I'm on a lot of committees by 
virtue of the office," Ulmer said, 
"and I spend a lot of time In a 
student advocacy role." He ex- 



plained that he takes the long-range 
perspective for students because 
individual students are transitory. 

When he started in 1964; at what 
was then only Indiana University, 
Ulmer was an academic counselor. 
Now he serves in a management and 
supervisory capacity as well. 

He is coordinator of a dozen or so 
offices and departments, including 
Health Services, Disabled Students 
Services, Union Building activities, 
and the Athletic department. He 
works with and directs committees, 
staff members, and task forces. 
Lately, he said, he has been going 
over the budgets with the various 
—offices -to —determine, -needs and 
excesses. 

With all his bureaucratic in- 
volvement and frustration-filled 
encounters, one might think Ulmer a 
likely prospect for therapy. He does, 
in fact, have a way of getting away 
from it all. 

"I love horses," he said, nodding 
toward the pictures on shelves. "1 
have five Arabs and a pony. I also 
have a little bit of land. I like to get 
out and work with both of them," he 
said. 

But to call this his therapy is to 
suggest that his job causes agitation. 
Ulmer said that this is not the case. 

"I love my work, working with 
students. It's a challenge, but a joy. 
And I love the diversity here," he 
said, referring to the fact that he 
works with students ranging from 18 
to50 years old or older. 

What does he consider the high 
point in his career? 

Ulmer tapped the ashes from his 
pipe into an ashtray, then stopped 
to reflect. 

"It's been great to see us grow 
from one building and 2600 students 
to several buildings and 10,000 
students. And from two degree of- 
ferings to what we have now," he 
said. His smile reflected that he was 
pleased to have been involved in 
such a process. 

His involvement is further 
exemplified in his participation in 
campus events and functions. Not 
limited tocampus involvement, he is 
a member of the Parkview Hospital 
Board of Directors and chairman of 
the CETA Advisory Committee. 

But Ulmer does not like to sound 
corny or overzealous. 

He said that by six o'clock he is 
ready to call it a day Sometimes 
that means just going home and 
grabbing a Michelob. 

But the last thing he does before 
leaving is check over his calendar 
again. He leans over his desk and 
notes whether there is a basketball 
game scheduled that night, or that 
he has an appointment the next day 
with a student who has been referred

and Vice President Steve Westrick 
disagree with combining SUBOG and 
the Student Senate. They feel that the 
effectiveness of student services would 
be decreased. 

The three former senators also feel 
that the revision of the Senate con- 
stitution last fall was a waste of time. 
Kuehn especially feels thai il drove the 
Senators apart because they bickered 
over how it should be written. 

Momper initially disagreed with the 
revision of the constitution, but was 
pleased with the way it turned out. 

Westrick reels that It look too long to 
write Ihe constitution when the Senate 
could have been serving the students in 



other ways. He is glad, however, that 
the revision produced a legislative 
affairs committee. 

Perhaps Kuehn summarized the 
feelings of Ihe three former senators 
the best when he said, "We really tried 
to make It work. Our hands were tied 
with rewriting the constitution. We 
weren't doing anything for the students 
and felt useless because we perceived 
we had no input from the students. 
What could we do?" 

He felt that il was up to (he students 
lo get involved, and that things 
wouldn't change by themselves. "It's 
your baby," Kuehn said. "Run with it."

PAGE2 -THE COMMUNICATOR 



Simon says 
elevators OK 



Dan Simon, an employee of Schindler 
Haughton, the elevator company that 
services IPFW's elevators, claims that 
the elevator that reportedly fell Feb. 2 in 
Kettler Hall did not fall. 

Simon contends that the two students 
who were on the elevator at the time of 
the "fall" in fact only experienced the 
"sensation of falling" caused by a minor 
mechanical problem with the elevator. 
The elevator had been inspected last 
December, Simon said, and checked just 
the day before the "fall." 

Regardless of the validity of the 
"falling" of the Kettler elevator, 
elevator problems do exist at IPFW. 

One case in point is the elevator in the 
Walb Memorial Union building. During 
the week beginning Feb. 9, the elevator 
in that buildng was out of order at least 
part of each day. In each instance, the 
elevator was stuck, with doors open, on 
one of the three floors— leaving those 
who must use an elevator without means 
of travelling to other floors 

During the same week, at least one of 
the elevators in Kettler Hall was not 
functioning properly. 

When boarding the Kettler elevator on 
the ground floor and pushing the button 
for the second floor, the elevator stopped 



on the first floor before proceeding to the 
second level. 

Again, when boarding it on the second 
floor and pushing the ground floor 
button, the elevator stopped at the first 
floor before going to its proper 
destination. 

Although the extra stops by the Kettler 
elevator seem to pose no dangerous 
situation, one wonders about the safety 
of improperly working elevators. 

Simon feels the elevators here are 
safe. 

He gave the elevators a "clean bill of 
health" after their yearly inspections, 
and each elevator is checked bi-weekly 
by Simon. 

Also during the same week, one of the 
two eleva tors in the Helmke Library was 
out of order for at least several hours on 
Monday. 

The only elevator on campus, it seems, 
that did not have operational problems 
last week was the one in Neff Hall. 

Simon said that abuse of campus 
elevators is not uncommon and causes 
many of the problems with them. 

While there may be valid reasons why 
the elevators here are semi-functional, 
we can only hope the situation is 
corrected soon.

"We work on developing 
the children's socialization 
and helping them feel good 
about themselves," said 
Sherry Janek, a teacher at 
the Center since 1979, In all 
programs the particular 
child is matched to the ac- 
tivity. 

Enrichment programs 
include music, stories, and 
activities that involve 
creative expression. 

Songs are selected to help 
the children respond to 
rhythm and develop an 
apprecialion of different 
kinds of music. 

Betsy Baker, who became 
five years old Feb. 16, is one 
of several children who likes 
to listen to story records 
during the afternoon quiet 
time. 

Story time is an op- 
portunity to encourage ef- 
fective listening skills in a 
relaxed atmosphere. Stories 
and poems are chosen to 
enable the children to 
acquire the beginnings of a 
taste for good literature. 

Paintings, hung on a rack 
to dry. or rolled "can- 
vasses," ready to take home, 
are evidence of the creative 
opportunity in art. Various 
craft materials are available 
to the children for ex- 
perimentation and self- 
expression. 

Powdered soap added to 
the paint used, adds texture 
and does not seem to distress 
the young artists. It is, 
however, a help to parents 
when doing the laundry. 

The children are taught to 
do many things (or them- 
selves, including ihe 
development of good habits. 
Cleanliness and orderliness 
are stressed as the children 
put away their materials and 
prepare for lunch. 

Lunches are brought from 
home. In addition parents 
are expected to provide a 
nutritious snack on a regular 
basis, according to the rules 
of the Center. Some parents

Parents often stop in to

Tangela Cassel, who works 
at the Center It is a more 
active time promoting 
classroom participation and 
emotional release. Finger 
plays and guided fantasies 
are favorite circle activities 
of the children. 

Cassell is one of 19 prac- 
bcum students who give 
time to the Center as 
volunteers and receive 
university credit for on-the- 
job training 

The practicum students 
are majors in a field related 
to child care. They help 
provide an unusually high 
ratio of adults to children at 
the Center. Instructed by 
lead teachers, they are 
trained to work with each 
age group of children. 

Cassell is ah education 
major and in addition to her 
work at the Center is doing 
observation for a class in 
early childhood education. 

One hundred-fifteen 
families take advantage of 
this economic and con-

Their cost is a S5.00 users

Concerts' problems subside 



ByJ.G.GRISWOLD 
Staff Writer 

A lack of rock concerts has 
plagued the Memorial 
Coliseum with less than five 
concerts in the past six 
months. 

In the past, local 
promoters blamed the lack 
of concerts on the numerous 
arrests made Tor "drug use, 
smoking, and alcoholic 
violations. 

The arrests became such 
an issue last spring that 
Mayor Winfield Moses was 
prompted to meet with 
concert goers at IPFW. At 
that meeting, Moses pledged 
to resolve the problem. 

Yet, despite his promises, 
problems still exist and 
concerts are few. 

General Manager of the 
Coliseum Don Myers 
believes that lack of concerts 
is not caused by the arrests 



Alumni groups join 
in serving students 



By MAY S. EHRESMAN 
Staff Writer 

The alumni activities at 
IPFW are an effort of two 
alumni groups, the IU 
Alumni Association and the 
Purdue Alumni Association. 
They offer students some 
activities and services as a 
part of their service to the 

The associations hosted an 
Old Timer's Soccer Game 
lAlumni vs. Varsity) and a 
continental breakfast for 
prospective students and 
their parents during Red and 
Gold Carpet Day. They 
distributed pocket calendars 
earlier in the school year and 
plan to sponsor a Student 
Leaders Reception and the 
Graduating Class Council. 

John Hobson, director of 
the alumni associations, 
talked about tentative plans 
to present an award based on 
academic record and ex- 
tracurricular activities to 
the most deserving senior. 

If there is sufficient 
student and faculty Interest 
shown, Hobson said he could 
arrange for a Career Day 
where past alumni would be 
invited to talk with students 
about what they have done 
with their degrees. 

By providing students wilh 



an awareness of the alumni 
associations through various 
activities during their un- 
dergraduate years, the 
associations hope to build 
their visibility among future 
graduates, and thus their 
memberships. 

Both alumni groups have 
their own officers and 
boards, but they work 
together from the same 
office IU Alumni 

President is Ruth Swank, 
principal of Perry Hill High 
School, and the Purdue 
Alumni is headed by Rob 
Pal e vie h, inventory control 
manager of Hardware 
Wholesalers Hobson 

coordinates the activities of 
both groups. 

A few of the benefits of 
joining either of IPFW's 
alumni associations include 
newsletters, life insurance, 
social activities, family 
camp (IU only), national 
membership and perhaps 
the opportunity to meet with 
and learn from other 
graduates— such as the 
president of People's Trust 
Bank, an actress in the soap 
opera, "All My Children," a 
rock musician and even Fort 
Wayne's first lady, Sue 
Moses— all members of Hie 
alumni associations.

IU students going to Met 



Btoomington — More than 
200 students from the 
Indiana University School of 
Music will be performing at 
the Metropolitan Opera 
House this spring. 

On April 26, the school's 
Opera Theater will present 
its American premiere 
production of Czech com- 
poser Bohuslav Martinu's 
"The Greek Passion" at the 
Met, as part of a five- 



performance New York

that have led critics and 
independent polls ofils peers

music school in the country.

but the economy. 

"We are being hurl by the 
economy," Myers explaines. 
"There are not very many 
acts touring around right 

Myers believes the arrest 
problem has been corrected. 
"It has resolved itself; 
concert goers are improving 
their conduct," claimed the 
manager. 

At the last rock concert 
held, Molly Hatchet, 
minimal arrests were made. 

Part of the reason for this 
decrease in arrests is 
because the Fort Wayne 
Police are no longer in "all 
out force" at the concerts, 
said Public Informations 
Officer Don Goodson. 

"We (Fort Wayne Police) 
are not wanted there by the 
Coliseum Board as we were 
in the past administration," 
explained Goodson. 



"They are more concerned 
with making money then 
enforcing the law," said the 
police spokesman. 

Goodson added that police 
are still present at concerts 
but are "less visible." There 
are now less uniform officers 
and more undercover police 
officers. 

"We will still monitor the 
concerts, but we will no 
longer use Gestapo tactics 
used by the past ad- 
ministration," said Goodson. 

Goodson added that police 
will still search entering 
concert goers if there is 
"probable cause" to do so. 

Generally, however, 
Goodson said that police will 
give warning to law violators 
before making arrests. 

"As a rule, most arrests 
that are made, are violators 
from out of town," Goodson

THE THREE RIVERS Fife 

and Drum Corps is 
constantly looking for 



ByKAYREUSSER 
Staff Writer 
A tall, well-built young 
man entered the crowded 
classroom. As he began to 
whisper, the class grew 
attentive. Suddenly, 
everyone began to make 
strange motions with their 
arms and fingers. 

Was this part of a code for 
a secret mission? 

No, it was the new 
American Sign Language 
class being offered by the 
Speech and Audiology 
Department. The professor 
is Cecil Bradley, who is deaf. 
He communicates to his 
class by speaking, lip 
reading, and using sign 
language. 

It may come as a surprise 
for some to know that a deaf 
person can speak. A deaf 
person is not necessarily 
mute. In fact, the terms 
"deaf-mute" and "deaf and 
dumb" are outdated and 
considered offensive to most 
deaf people. 

The vocal chords are not at 
all affected by loss of 
hearing. A person bom deaf 
has no way of knowing what 
a word is supposed to sound 
like or how to utilize his 
vocal chords to pronounce it 
correctly. Thus, it appears a 
deaf person cannot speak, 
only because he doesn't 
know now. 

For this reason, deaf 
people prefer to com- 
municate using sign 
language. Sign language 
includes both signing and 
fingerspelling. Signin g uses 

men and women 
members to become a 
part of the group If you 
have had musical ex- 
perience and would be 
interested in playing the 
fife and long drum as 
presented in the 
Revolutionary and Post 
Revolutionary period, 
please contact: Gary 
Kuntz, 429-7064 or 484- 
3046. 



motions that stand for entire 
words. 

Fingerspelling, on the 
other hand, gives each letter 
of the alphabet a distinct 
handshape. Names, for 
example, are fingerspelled 
when Ihe correct spelling 
might be questionable. 

Students in the class come 
from varied backgrounds, 
such as dental hygiene, 
supervision, and mental 
health. They feel that adding 
sign language to their 
profession will be a help to 
the handicapped people in 
the community where they 
will work. 

Besides teaching part- 
time, Mr. Bradley works at 
the Anthony Wayne

struction for HPER, 
reported they are only 
two weeks off schedule. 
Denny Squires, 

superintendent for 
Jackson Construction, 
reported that [he lecture 
area of HPER will be 
finished in August. 
Haggerman's superin- 
tendent, Mike Koch, said 
the reason for the two- 
week delay was primarily 
due to bad weather 
conditions. Both com- 



panies reported that 
strike situations have not 
been a factor since last 
summer. 

The costs of the two 
buildings have been 
estimated in varying 
degrees over the past four 
years. A first Building 
"D" was projected to cost 
$6 million, but according 
to the Office of Financial 
Affairs, the cost is set at 
$4.6 million and cannot go 
over that figure. Similar- 
ly the HPER Building 
was expected to cost $4.5 ' 
million, but was budgeted 
at $4,117,000. 

Building "D," ac- 
cording to Jerry Medley, 
director of University 
Relations, is "a real 
added plus to Ihe campus 
due to the fine medical 
education program that 
will now be available." 
■The building will contain 
50,000 square feet of 
space. It will be divided 
into five modules. 

Building "D" will in- 
clude: the medical 
education program, 20 
classrooms, a lecture- 
performance complex, 
Arts &amp; Letters facilities 
and the division of Music. 

The laboratories will 



include a gross anatomy 
lab, multipurpose lab, 
faculty research lab, 
animal facility and a 
controlled environment 
facility. 

The lecture per- 
formance complex will 
seat 590. There will also 
be a theatre performance 
hall. The building will 
have a foyer that will 
serve as a faculty and 
student commons area. 

The music module will 
have an instrument 
rehearsal storage with an 
ie foot ceiling, instrument 
and choral music library 
room, percussion in- 
struction room, in- 
dividual practice room, 
private teaching studio 
and an electric piano lab. 
The HPER building will 
have five handball courts, 
three full-size basketball 
courts, an indoor jogging 
track elevated above the 
basketball courts, plus 
facilities for indoor 
tennis, volleyball, 
gymnastics, wrestling, 
weightliRing, fencing, 
and dancing. When 
equipped with bleachers 
the building will have a 
seating capacity of 2,550 
surrounding the main 
basketball court.

IPFW to mount opera 



Cast practices 



By TIM BATZ 
Staff Writer 

"A lot of people feel that 
culture has to hurl and that 
it's dull and boring. One of 
our aims with this opera is to 
show people that culture can 
be fun and entertaining," 
said Dr. Joseph Meyers, 
associate professor of music 
at IPFW 

The opera is "I. Pagliacci" 
by Ruggiere Leoncavallo 
and will be performed in 
English so the audience can 
get a better grasp of the 
performance. It involves 
some issues which are 
contemporary — clandestine 
affairs and murder of 
passion. 

Meyers views the per- 
formance as a form of 
outreach. "Operas are not 
ungodly long and boring. In 
fact, most operas don't 
exceed two hours, including 
intermission. Musicals and 
operas are quite similar. The 
big difference is that with an 
opera, most of the per- 
formance is sung," he said. 

"I Pagliacci" will be 
performed at the Concordia 
High School auditorium on ii 
Feb. 27 and Mar. 14 at 8 p.m. 
There will be a Sunday 



matinee, Mar. 15 at 3 p.m. 

The well known opera is 
set in a town in Italy around 
1890. Lincoln Chapman plays 
the lead role of Canio, leader 
of a group of actors, jugglers 
and acrobats. His wife 
Nedda, played by Dorothy 
Kittaka, has an affair with 
Silvio (Keith Brautigml, a 
villager. She is betrayed by 
Tonio &lt; Larry Reed! a hunch- 
back who was scorned by 
Nedda. 

Canio finds out about the 
affair, but not the respon- 
sible party If he could find 
out, he would kill both Nedda 
and her lover. He confronts 
her repeatedly, with the 
tragic ending coming at the 
end of the second act of a 
'■play within a play." 

There will be a casting 
change for the Saturday 
performance with Connie 
Thatcher playing Nedda and 
Steve Nahrwold playing 
Beppe The orchestra will be 
conducted by Anthony 
Adessa. The cast of 80 
includes an adult chorus of 
30, led by Pat Kennedy, and 
a children's chorus of 17, 
composed of students from 
Aboite and Lafayette 
elementary schools 



"We have produced one 
opera a year each of the 
seven years that I have been 
here," said Meyers. "This is 
the first year that we have 
made a big media push. I 
have been running opera 
tours " for groups to see 
performances in cities like 
Chicago, Detroit and Cin- 
cinnati. We've always had a 
sufficient response for these 
charters and I would say 
there is a sizable group in 
Fort Wayne that has a 
definite interest in opera." 

When asked about claims 
that opera performed in any 
language other than the 
original loses something, 
Meyers said, "Those claims 
are grossly exaggerated. 
There are some purists who 
feel that way but there are 
many companies worldwide 
that perform exclusively in 
their native tongue It makes 
it so much easier for the 
members of the audience 
who are not big opera fans to 
follow a long." 

Tickets, available at the 
music office in Neff Hall, are 
W for adults, S3 for senior 
citizens and students, and 
free for activity card 
holders. 



Bv NANCY SLICK 
Staff Writer 
The Arena Dinner Theatre 
opened its latest mystery- 
drama, "Laura," to a full 
house on Friday night. The 
drama, written by Vera 
Caspary and George Sklar, 
was directed by Denny 
Bechtelhcimer and was well- 
received by the viewing 
audience. 

This whodunit centers 
around a mysterious 1943 
murder in the New York 
apartment of Laura Hunt, 
and detective Mark 
McPherson ( Ed Liptak) 
must investigate the crime 
and interrogate the various 
characters that visit the 
scene. 

Liptak's portrayal of the 
smooth, confident detective 
was effective yet lacking in 
energy. His vocal projection 
was low in the first act, and 
perhaps that accounts for his 
appearing too low-key. His 
act two performance was 
much stronger. 

A marvelous performance 
was given by James Yarnell 
as the suave and arrogant 
Waldo Lydecker, a close 



friend of Laura's. Although 
Yarnell was quite young to 
play the part, he played it 
with great talent, and his 
portrayal was smooth and 
energetic. 

A nol-so-smooth per- 
formance was that of 
Laura's fiance, Shelby 
Carpenter, played by Tom 
Felts. Felts had energy 
enough to play the role, but 
he seemed not to know just 
how to use that energy and 1 
delivered it in dramatic 
spurts. 

Dorothy Rioux as Laura's 
servant, Bessie Clary, was 
an absolute delight. Her 
portrayal was light and 
lovely and brought forth 
many bursts of laughter. Her 
confused looks and inquiries 
were wonderful. 

Carolyn Simmon's por- 
trayal of Laura's neighbor, 
Mrs. Dorgan, was also en- 
joyable. Her performance 
abounded with energy, and 
her angry manner prompted 
many chuckles as she 
disciplined her son, Danny 
(GuyPelfrey). 



Pelfrey's portrayal of the 




ideating young Danny, 
who has become infatuated 
with Laura, was nicely done. 
He played the role 
believably with a boyish 
innocence, and the struggle 
with his emotions was 
convincingly felt, 

Kathy Lew ton's per- 
formance of A Girl was 
adequately done in acts one 
and two, although at times 
she didn't seem quite angry 
enough nor quite fearful 
enough. However, her act 
two scene with Shelby and 
her act three scene with 
Waldo were very well 
played. 

Dave Churchward played 
a convincing detective, 
Olsen, and Sylvia 
Bechtulhinmer opened and 
closed the show with (he 
song "Laura." with ac- 
companiment by Susanne 
B unveil, 

The show was slowly 
paced, at times, but with a 
winding plot and careful 
direction by Denny 
Bechtelheimer, it was at- 
tention-holding and en- 
joyable.

'Competition' goes for red ribbon 



ByMIKEGEFFEN 
Chief Reporter 

"The Competition" suffers 
from what might be called 
the red ribbon syndrome. 
This malady occurs when 
filmmakers opt for a con- 
venient, easy ending rather 
than a tougher one. These 
endings sew up the plot and 
leave nothing to the 
imagination. 

Happy endings are good 
box office, and are simple to 
write, but sometimes they 
turn an otherwise strong 
picture into a somewhat 
unrealistic one. This is what 
happens to "The Com- 
petition "—instead of being a 
little tougher, the film- 
makers go for the red ribbon. 

However, Ihe red ribbon 
syndrome is the only flaw in 



an otherwise likable film. 
"Competition" covers 
ground rarely dealt with in 
Hollywood. The film 
ponders the question of 
whether a man and a woman 
aspiring to the top of the 
same profession can be 
generous lovers. "Com- 
petition" effectively depicts 
modern love as a race be- 
tween two accomplished 
people struggling for first 
The film is at its best 
when showing Ihe frustration 
the two lovers feel over 
getting involved with 
someone you're competing 
against. 

Writer-director Joel 
Olansky's script is filled with 
chsp dialogue for the most 
part, although a few 
melodramatic lines creep in, 



r. 



such as when Paul Delrich 
I Richard Dreyfuss) tells 
Heidi Schoonover ( Amy 
Irving), "I just want to gel 
inside of you and pull you 
like a blanket over me." 
These melodramatic lapses 
aside, Olansky develops the 
relationship between Paul 
and Heidi in a realistic, 
unsentimental way, giving 
them a friendship first and 
avoiding the love-at-first- 
sight trap prevalent in most 
romantic films. 

Olansky gets hard-edged 
performances from most of 
the cast particularly Lee 
Hemick and Richard 
Dreyfuss. Dreyfuss is good 
and in this role he soft pfdals 
the cutesy-poo charm that 
has ruined some of his 
performances. He un- 



derplays Paul, giving his 
egotistical outbursts a 
harsher edge, 

Lee Remick, as Greta 
Vandemann, Heidi'smentor, 
is superb. She plays Greta as 
a strong willed woman who 
has control over her life, and 
who believes that you 
shouldn't foil in love while 
striving to reach the top. 
Remick is an accomplished 
actress, and in Greta she 
gets a chance to flex her 
muscles. It's a strong role 
and wonderful showcase for 
a fine actress and she almost 
steals the film. 

Unfortunately, Amy Irving 
doesn't fare as well as 
Dreyfuss or Remick. She has 
a tendency to project a 
certain sameness into every 
roll she plays, and Heidi is no 



exception. The same twang 
she had in "Honeysuckle 
Rose" where she played an 
aspiring country singer pops 
up in this film even though 
she is playing an upper 
middle class pianist. Irving 
simply doesn't have the 
magnetic charm the role 
requires. As a result, her 
performance is lifeless. 

All in all. "The Com- 
petition is an okay film 
with many fine moments, 
hurt mostly by the director's 
decision to tie the final 
minutes up in a red ribbon. 
To the film's credit, 
however, it deals 

realistically with an aspect 
ot relationships hardly dealt 
with in films, and for thai the 
film is to be commended. 



By GLORIA HIZER 
Starr Writer 

"No Cowboys, No Indians, 
No Cavalry to the Rescue, 
Only a Cop." So the ad reads 
billing "Fort Apache, The 
Bronx" as a film promising 
to entertain the action- 
seeking theatergoer as well 
as line the pockets of the 
producers, directors and 
actors in the film. 

"Fort Apache" is about a 
cop — a cop on (he beat who 
lets common sense and a 
conscience govern his every 
move. Paul Newman is 
Officer Murphy. His 18 years 
of service affords him 
thorough knowledge of 
Bronx street life and 
promotes an atmosphere of 
understanding and rapport 
with the people. Newman is 
his typical cool character, 
but is " often ruffled by 
Captain Connoly, the new- 
precinct boss played by 
Edward Asner. Connoly's 
by-the-book tactics produce 
the inevitable butting of 
heads. 

The Bronx is depicted as a 
teeming den of iniquity- 
drugs, prostitution, unsolved 
murders, police corruption 
— all in a setting of 
deteriorating buildings and 
streets filled with trash. In 
his attempt to create an 
atmosphere befitting the 
theme of street violence, 
executive producer David 
Susskind has caused quite an 
uproar from this New York 
community. Whalbeganasa 
pure action film of cops and 
robbers has induced a public 
outcry that the movie is 
racist and presents a 
negative image of blacks and 
Puerto Ricans in South 

As a result, the Committee 
Against Fort Apache 
(CAFAl was organized and 



aligned itself with other 
minority organizations and 
Congressman Robert Garcia 
from New York in an at- 
tempt to boycott (he showing 
of the movie in local 
theaters 

Shortly before the film's 
release in February, 1981, 
CAFA representative Diana 
Perez appealed to New York 
theaters to "not lake part in 
this racial assault" and 
refuse to show the movie. 
But despite an almost year- 
long battle to halt the filming 
of the movie, it opened with 
only a moderate amount of 
negative attention. 

Newman is tired of the 
film's controversy. In an 
interview with "The 
Indianapolis Star," he states 
that the film is tough. "It's 
tough on blacks, it's tough on 
Puerto Ricans, it's tough on 
cops. If you are doing a 
movie about cops, you can't 
have Easter egg hunts and 
wedding parties," he said in 
the article. 

Precinct 41, the Bronx, has 
been nicknamed "Fort 
Apache" because, according 
to the movie, it is a "fort in 
hostile territory," the only 
place where old people can 
be reasonably sure that they 
won't get mugged. CAFA 
and other concerned citizens 
resent (his negative por- 
trayal of their community 

"Fort Apache" contains a 
generous amount of action 
chases, riots, fights, burning 
buildings, and murders 
which should satisfy the 
average "Kojak" type of 
viewer. And the characters 
themselves come across as 
believable, real people. 
Murphy knows how tohandle 
individual street situations, 
but Connoly is concerned 
with the citizens as a whole 
and (rieslodemonstratethat 



Precinct 41 is the house of 
the law and there to serve 
the people. 

Corelli, Murphy's rookie 
partner, played by Ken 
Wahl, has the "dress for 
success" attitude on the job, 
and promises to be more 
than a cop in his life. But it is 
obvious that as good a cop as 
he is, he will probably be a 
lifer just like Murphy. 
Contrary to what the CAFA 
implies about racism, the 
film seems to bend over 
backwards to show the 
Italian cop Corelli and Irish 
born Murphy working 
closely together and 
depending on each other in 
life and death situations. 

Underlying the law en- 
forcement theme of the film 
is interwoven a mild love 
story where Murphy falls for 
a nurse. The tragic ending of 
this affair emphasizes the 
tough life in the Bronx and 
gives an air of genuine 
human tenderness to the 
character. 

"Fort Apache, The Bronx' ' 
is good Saturday afternoon 
entertainment but probably 
won't win any awards this 
year. The actual social 
impact of the film is slight 
and perhaps a bit one sided, 
showing mostly the low life 
of the Bronx. But the story is 
based on the real life drama 
of former policemen Tom 
Mulhearn and Pete Tessi tore 
and it presents the law en- 
forcement point of view. Any 
social implications derived 
must come from the viewer. 

Did you know that 
Am erica's most patriotic 
bird is the wild (urkey? 
When the bird feels 

threatened, its caruncres, 
around its throat, swell and 
turn to shades of red, white 
and blue.

Country craze grabs city 

Rednecks love it 



By JAMIE WISE 

Start Writer 

Zoltan Herman, or Zoli, is 

enthusiastic about his new 
project 

"I just want everybody to 
have a good time," he says, 
pointing toward the dance 
floor. "I heard that band at a 
bar and I said 'I have to 
have that band: I just love 
their music.'" 

The band is The Coun- 
trymen, an MOR foursome 
who goodnaturedly plunk out 
Top 40 country hits at The 
Cowboy, formerly Zoli's 
Chalet, at 4114 Covington 
Road 

On either side of the large 
planked dance floor are long 
banquet tables covered in 
downhome red-and-white 
checked tablecloths. Groups 
of would-be ranchers and 
their womenfolk guzzle down 
pitchers of beer and wait it 
out for their favorite Hank 
Williams and Waylon Jen- 
nings tunes. 

At the other end of the 
large hall is the Cowboy's 
main attraction, "flika," the 
black mechanical bull, 
solemnly waits for 
challengers inside a rough- 
wood barn pen. Hoosier 
cowboys and cowgirls, 
escorted by Drew Colby, the 
self-styled "bull operator," 
sidestep over the black vinyl 
mat and mount "Bika." 
Colby gently sets them 
center-straight and gives 
them on-the-spot in- 
structions. 

"We don't want to hurt 
anybody," he says, his eyes 
never leaving the center of 
thering.-It'sallinfun." 



At two bucks a throw, it's 
more than fun. It's the 
challenge of nerve against 
steel. 

"I did it and I didn't fall 
off," one girl exclaims as she 
falls into the arms of her 
supporters just outside the 
archway. Meanwhile 
another hopeful rider is on 
his way in. Then Bika starts 
bucking and the crowd 
cheers the broncobuster in 
friendly fascination. 

There seems to be no such 
fascination at Gradie's 
Place, at 5002 Decatur Rd. 
Outside the parking lot is full 
of vans and pick-up trucks. 
Inside the van crowd 
prevails sporting the 
ubiquitous 6-inch western 
hats loaded down flam- 
boyantly with cockfeathers 
and plumes. There are a few 
clean-cut and motorcycle 
types as well sharing the 
club-sized tables grouped 
around the stage. 

Tacked up on a bulletin 
board inside the front door 
next to an autographed photo 
of Crystal Gayle is a sign 
warning "No Bucknives 
Allowed." Bill Gaham, the 
youthful manager found 
hammering part of a raised 
platform, smiles ruefully 
and explains: 

"Yeah, I got stabbed. 
Some guy caught his ex-wife 
in here with another guy. 
One thing led to another and 
well. I got caught in the 
middle of it." 

The crowd doesn't really 
seem rough, but rowdy. The 
bartender looking like prep- 
gone-comic, props one long 
leg over the bar and jauntily

adjusts a tall chef's hat, 
adding a bizarre touch to the 
scene. Over at a nearby 
table, a waitress dressed 
head-to-toe in tight black 
polyester cracks a wad of 
gum and indifferently waits 
for a younger customer to 
pay up. 

The whole ramshackle 
joint is black and red with an 
eerie green wash over the 
instruments on stage. The 
Silver Dollar Band, the 
house regulars, play loud, 
gruntin', sweatin' country 
rock with the compulsory, 
ear-bustin' lead guitar licks 
thrown in to satisfy the at- 
tentive customers. 

The Picker, an established 
country and western bar at 
4015 Northrop Dr., has its 
own loyal following as well. 
There is the same red and 
black interior and the same 
smoky haze hangs mid-way 
over the crowded room. 

This is a comfortable 
hangout for a huge sub- 
culture of Americans known 
as "redneck." These are the 
people who have lived the 
country songs, had their 
wives or husbands cheat on 
'em, know someone in jail. 
These are the folks who 
smoke high-nicotine 
cigarettes and don't give a 
hoot what the Surgeon 
General thinks ; the ones who 
knew who Mel Tillis was 
before the rest of the world 
caught on to western gear.

There are plenty of 
bleached blonds sitting next 
to well-tended beer bellies. 
Outsiders are welcome and 
at the same time, tolerated. 

Steve, the manager, is 
worried and jocular about 
The Cowboy. "You been 
there tonight? Oh, yeah. 
How was it? Aw, it'll begone 
in about a month or so." 

He greets regulars and 



newcomers with the same 
countrified alacrity. "Go 
ahead on in, Slim," he tells 
one large customer, "I never 
mess with the big guys. " 

Inside, Natchez, one of 
several bands the Picker 
books from Nashville, is 
hollering out Rodney 
Crowell's "Ain't Livin' Long

crowd and a packed dance 
floor.

hold of Fort Wayne like other 
cities around the U.S. And

Elkhart band has potential 



By GRETCHEN HOLODICK 
Staff Writer 

Recently, at Dallas Junc- 
tion, a band from Elkhart 
has cranked out some of the 
toughest jams this city has 
heard for a long time. They 
call themselves Stencil 
Forest and label their music 
as progressive. 

They've only been around 
since April of 1980 and they 
are looking really good. 
Main influences seem to be 
from bands like Yes, U.K., 
and Genesis. 

This particular type of 
band usually has a tough 
time playing in bars that are 
hard rock, heavy metal and 



disco orientated. Stencil 
Forest has worked out some 
solutions to this problem. 
They get the crowd going by 
playing tunes from bands 
such as AC-DC and Van 
Halen. Then after a couple of 
sets they do some popular 
Genesis songs and finally go 
into their own sings. It goes 
over pretty well. 

Currently Stencil Forest is 
doing very well in their own 
town. A local radio station is 
playing a couple of originals 
by the band. The station is 
WVPE, Elkhart, and one of 
the songs is called "Celestial 
Voices." Anyone familiar 
with progressive rock might 



recognize the title as a subtle 
pull from Yes. 

Stencil Forest is Doug 
Anderson on lead vocals, 
Frank Casella on keyboards 

and lead guitar, Stan Swaim 
on drums, Rick Cassella also 
on keyboards, Rob Neilson 
on lead guitar, and Scott 
Noyeronbass. 

Stencil Forest is currently 
managed by an independent 
agency and has had quite a 
few jobs backing some of the 
bigger bands that come 
ground the area Their next 
.^engagement will be . in 
Mishawaka at Music Box on 



Feb. 25 and 26. After that, 
they will be playing at the 
Headquarters in Elkhart 

Stencil Forest is a high 
quality band, which plays 
excellent music whether it's 
their own or other bands'. 
The keyboards are handled 
extremely well, and the 
guitar work is vigorous and 
thrilling. The beat is driving; 
the vocals are smooth and 
powerful. Although their 
talents never match those of 
Steve Howe or Bill Bruford, 
Stencil Forest is climbing 
high and it won't be sur- 
prising if they make it to the 
top in the music business.

Some players wear 
G-string bikinis 



ByJENSM.SOHENSEN 
Staff Writer 

There's nothing difficult 
about playing volleyball, 
right? Just string up a net on 
a sandy beach on a sunny 
day and bal the ball back and 
forth, while soaking up the 
rays and getting a fabulous 

Rules? Just a few: All 
women will wear bikinis and 
the men will be suitably 
dressed in as few garments 

legally required. The 

er shall not serve until 
each player has had the 
opportunity to refresh 

iclf with a healthy swig 
of his favorite brew. And the 
lei shall be low enough to 
illow the shortest player on 
the court to spike the ball. 
One more thing— overhand 

ss are strictly passe. 
After all, the object is not to 

it's to impress that cute 
girl in the G-slring bikini. 

But what's that the IPFW 
volleyball learn is playing? 
It can't be volleyball. For 
one thing, it's played in the 
winter and everyone knows 



it's impossible to get a tan 
indoors. Besides, Coach 
Arnie Ball is talking about 
things like complicated 
offensive and defensive 
strategies. Yeah, men's 
varsity intercollegiate 
volleyball is definitely a 
different game than beach 
volleyball. 

"The kids are finding that 
volleyball is a very com- 
plicated game." Ball said 
"We run thi-ee different 
offenses and three different 
defenses, as well as five 
different offensive plays. " In 
volleyball, a player must 
learn to play 12 different 
positions, six offensive and 
six defensive. "I don't know 
of any other sport where this 
is true," the coach added, 
explaining that all this 
makes it very difficult for an 
inexperienced team to win 
against top-flight com- 
petition. 

Speaking of top-flight 
competition, the Tuskers 
traveled to the University of 
Pittsburgh last weekend and 
got their first look at 



powerful Ohio State. 
"they're big and strong. 
Awesome. They're 
experienced. I predict they'll 
win the conference," Ball 
said after the Buckeyes 
demolished the Tuskers, 15- 
2,15-3. 

After coming back to lose 
the first set against the U.S. 
Military at West Point, 15-2, 
the Tuskers began to play 
some credible volleyball. 
IPFW regrouped to capture 
the second set from the 
future Army officers, 15-9, 
before bowing in three sets. 
The Tuskers lost their third 
game of the tourney to 
Cincinnati, 15-11, 15-10. 

"We've finally decided 
we're not as bad as we think 
we are," Ball remarked. 
"We began to pass-serve a 
little better, began to play 
defense and we finally 
started playing better alter 
the shellshock of Ohio State. 
We've seen an improvement 
of our freshman kids, 
especially Pat Menzie in 
middle blocking and hitting, 
which he must do for us to 



Tuskers beat Aquinas 



By TIMOTHY J. ROSS 
Sports Editor 

The IPFW men's 
basketball team finished last 
week's play with a close win 
over Aquinas. 

The team showed "a more 
intense performance," said 
Ken Workman, head coach 
of the Tuskers. 

The first half lead bounced 
back and forth with Aquinas 
leading 38-35 at the half. 

More excitement 

prevailed however during 
the second half, particularly 
near the game's finish. 

"It was a helter skelter 
finish — the last four 
minutes hectic and filled 
with very aggressive play," 
said Workman. 

Forward Gary Rinard set 
the' stage by producing four 
consecutive points, two from 
the foul line, to bring the 



Tuskers within five points of 
Aquinas (65-59) in the final 
four minutes. 

Forward Brian Grady soon 
added two more bringing the 
Tuskers within three points 
of the lead. Adding to the 
team effort, center Rickie 
Smith hit two from the foul 
line to keep the pace moving. 

According to Workman, 
Aquinas began to stall at 
mid-court in order to run 
down the clock while IPFW 
remained down by three (66- 
63). 

They might have been 
successful had It not been for 
the quick hands and 
aggressiveness of Rinard. 
Although his two first at- 
tempts to break the stall 
were unsuccessful, he kept 
trying. He regained 
possession of the ball and 
quickly passed it to Smith. 



Smith put the ball through 
the hoop to bring the men's 
team within one. 

With 25 seconds re- 
maining, Rinard dropped 
one through from the 
baseline, putting the Tuskers 
up by one where they stayed 



despite an Aquinas drive at 
the eight second mark. 

Smith led the scoring with 
21 points, Rinard followed 
with 16, and Grady lended 12. 

"There was a better 
overall team effort and the 
intensily level of play was 



much higher," said Work- 
man of the game. 

Earlier in the week, the 
Tuskers lost to Fort Wayne 
rival St. Francis (58-55). 

"There was a complete 
lack of intense competition 
on our part— we let them set 
the pace," said Workman 



Coach may now smile 



ByMlKEFRANKE 
Chief Reporter 

With one streak thankfully 
out of the way the IPFW 
Women's Basketball team 
has anolher streak to ex- 
perience. The new streak 
may bring more smiles from 
head coach Peggy Voisin. 

Last Thursday night the 
Tuskers ended a twelve 
game losing streak with a 79- 
51 victory over Tri-State at 
the Concordia Seminary 
gym. 

The game against Tri- 
State brought about a team 
consistency that coach 
Voisin has been looking for 
throughout the team's losing 
streak. Consistency leads to 
a balanced effort which is 
jusl what the Tuskers had, 
as each member of the team 
scored at least one point. 

The Tuskers busted out to 
a 34-20 half-time lead. The 
second half started out on a 
bad note for IPFW. Tri-State 
pressed from the outset of 
the second half, causing 
some costly Tusker turn- 
overs, Coach Voisin had to 
call a timeout to get things 
straightened out. "I had to 
iell them that we were still 
leading the game, so relax 
and play our game," she 
said. 

Kathleen Smith once again 
led the way for the Tuskers 
by scoring 25 points and 
grabbing off 15 rebounds. 



Smith hit69 percent from the 
floor. Ann Klopfenstein 
poured in 14 points, and Sue 
Hendricks hit for 13. Amy 
Brunow chipped in with 10 
markers. 

The key to the victory was 
a simple one. Voisin said, 
"we rut 46 percent from the 
floor and out-rebounded Tri- 
State badly." 

Saturday the Tuskers 
made il two victories in a 
row. Backed by a balanced 
offensive threat the women 
beat Purdue Calumet 55-41. 
Commenting on the victory 
Voisin said, "We were much 
more patient and poised than 
we have been in a long 

Calumet threw a press at 
IPFW but it didn't seem to 
bother the Tuskers on this 
day, as the team committed 
only ten turnovers in the 
game 

Being "loose" on the court 
seems to be a key to any 
success (he Tuskers achieve. 
This attitude was evident 
Saturday as Sue Hendricks 
made a pinpoint behind-the- 
back-pass to a teammate 
that Larry Bird would have 
been proud of. Hendricks led 
the Tuskers with 15 points, 
while Karen Dircksen added 
10 points. Team rebounding 
was also a strong point as 
three players were in double 
figures on the boards. 

The Tuskers have one 



regular season game left on 
the schedule. Last night the 
team was to play Grace in 
the final regular season 
home game. The finale 
comes up next Tuesday night 
when the team travels to 
Goshen. 

IPFW will host the North- 
ern District Post Season 
Tournament at Concordia 
Seminary Gym beginning on 
Feb. 27. The tournament will 
run for two days. 

Coach Voisin feels that 
things could be falling into 
place at a most opportune 
time for her squad. She said, 
"A winning streak going into 
the tournament could be 
beneficial to the team. We 
may be peaking at the right 



Horror grips 
B-ball courts 

By TIMOTHY J. ROSS 
Sports Editor 

Mad Bombers, Slime Brothers, the Dwarfs and Marvin, 
Stoneface II — monsters from outer space, rejects from 
horror films or possibly a science fiction novel? 

If you guessed any of these, too bad. You are wrong! 

These are four of the 18 intramural basketball teams 
participating in the intramural program at IPFW. 

The other teams are Main Frames, Old Dribblers, All 
Stars, "81" 8's, Thisisus, Simply Awesom, Sig Eps, The 
Wind, The Sting, NewComers, Sky Kings, Peonies Choice 
Schoenling's Little Kings, and Delta Sigma Phi. 

You may wonder about teams that pick such different — 
yes you might even say strange — names, but according 
to junior Kim Heimann, director of the intramural 
program, "Some of the teams are very good and well 
organized." 

Several of the teams have proven this by remaining 
undefeated during the first weeks of the intramural 
season. As of Feb. 11, two teams from Division A, the Old 
Dribblers and the All Stars, are unbeaten. They are both 
at 2-0. 

Matching that record are two teams from Division C, 
the Sky Kings and Stoneface II. 

The Mad Bombers currently hold the Division B top spot 
with three wins and no losses. 

The intramural basketball games are held on Mondays 
and Wednesdays at the Concordia Seminary. They tip-off 
at7:30and8:30p,m.
