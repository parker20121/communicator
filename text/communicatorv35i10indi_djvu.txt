Birch Bayh knows how 
important a few votes can be. 

In his upset win over an 
incumbent Indiana Republican 
senator, Bayh won by two votes 
per precinct. Had jusl handfuls 
of people not voted, or voted 
differently, in Indiana that year, 
he may have had his political 

That 1962 win led to a 
nearly 20-year post as a U.S. 
Senator, and a 1 976 primary bid 
for the presidency. He lost in 
the primary to eventual 
President Jimmy Carter, and, 
swept up in the 1980 Reagan 
revolution, lost his reelection 
campaign to the U.S. Senate 
that year to Dan Quayle. 

Bayh stopped at IPFW 
Friday, speaking with the class 
"Indiana State Politics," taught 
by instructor Andy Downs 
inside Classroom Medical 1 12.

Geri Miller of SPEA. 

Susan Hannah. Vice 
Chancellor of Academic

The positions of the pro-

of the professors would not

prediction on who would win 
the election. However, he com-

tion major didn't find a lol of 
common ground with some of 
Bayh's thoughts. 

"I just disagreed with him 
on all his issues," Michael 

Downs said while Bayh is 
"extremely opinionated," the 
session wasn't about politics, 

"If. Senator (Richard) 
Lugar was traveling through the 
state, I'd say 'Come on in,"' 
Ddwns explained. The one 
caveat he asked of Bayh was 
not to do an official endorse- 
ment of any candidate. 

While he made no 
endorsements, he did give his 
opinions. 

While presidential and 
gubernatorial politics rage away 
in the mass media, the elections 
that make a difference on local 
levels are those for school

"I saw a few bumper 
stickers on a car. One was 
Kerry-Edwards, and the other 
was My Man Milch. I don't 
know how you get there," he 
said, sparking a laugh. "That's a 
little of an inconsistency." 

The former senator was 
partially in Fort Wayne stomp- 
ing for Indiana Governor Joe 
Keman, but look time to speak 
with IPFW students about the 
importance of their vote, and 
answered questions pertaining 
to his thoughts about Election 
2004. 

Standing by Keman when 
asked about recent advertise- 
ments, Bayh asked if there were 
non-truths in the television 
spots and noted he'd known 
Keman since his days of being 
, Vietnam pris- 



And the moves have been 
equally bad fiscally, he claimed. 

"College students, they 
have their whole future ahead 
of them. If they have a govern- 
ment that's going to run a $500 
billion deficit - the largest in 
history - they and their grand- 
children are going to be paying 
for it," he said. 

He also disagreed with the 
educational No Child Left 
Behind initiative, saying it is a 
good, but underfunded, idea. 
The underfunding is hurting 
educators - and in turn the edu- 
eaied, he claimed. 

"You talk to school 
administrators, they're 

stretched ... they don't have 
enough resources to help the 
support system for something 
like No Child Left Behind," he 



Much of ERA eventually 
evolved into Title IX, a rule not- 
ing how women should be 
given equal treatment in aca- 
demic endeavors. Many know 
Title IX for how it has impacted 
athletic scholarships at NCAA 
schools, but it is not the way 
Bayh looks at the rule. 

Although never passed, 
most of the beliefs of ERA are 
now standard rules for busi- 
and colleges. 



"I sense that our political 
system has become more polar- 
ized than ever before. We have 
some of these right-wing zealot 
religious people who believe

"We've got some crazies

Bayh is the father of for-

Despite Evan being mentioned 
as a possible running mate for 
John Kerry, Birch Bayh con- 
tends the family never brings up

Current students active on

impacted their lives. Amy Egly,

all juniors, spoke about how 
IPFW has been a positive cxpc- 

Sayan, who is studying

housing facilities in Waterfield. 
In his speech, Sayan referred to 
the people he works with at 
Waterfield as "family" and 
applauded the student housing 
as being among the best to his 
experience. 

In his speech during the 
luncheon, Berry, a history 
major, discussed how IPFW 
impacted him. 

"IPFW has become more 
than a place to go to class. It 
has become a family to me.

I know who I blame: 
George W. Bush. 

Sir, you willingly sent 
people to die. You put them in a 
situation of danger and they 
died, so I blame you. I blame 
you for all of this and I blame 
the people who voted for you. 

I place my blame on your 
Cabinet for letting this madness 
go on and I blame you most of 
all for the death of so many, 
civilian and military. 

Which draws me to my 
conclusion, I am issuing a citi- 
zens arrest warrant for you 
George W. Bush for the crime 
of genocide of the American 
people and failure to live up the 
to the responsibilities of the 
office you hold because at this 
point in time I'd take "Twinkie

The Mid-East question, part 2 



Addressing the question I 
raised two weeks ago about the 
Israeli question, I do think that 
there should be some revisions 
on the location and exact cir- 
cumstances involving the 
Israeli instatement in Palestine. 

Personally, I have always 
advocated the typical American 
stance, and this is for two rea- 
sons. One. I am a Catholic who 
has the personal spiritual belief 
that they (Israelis) should and 
have returned to their promised

suffering and terrible disposi- 
tion around mid- century in the 
1900s, I am compelled to

Since I have come to col- 
lege in the search of higher 
learning, however, I have 
become aware of the fact that 
not everyone else shares ideolo- 
gies like my own. 

Also, I do not know for 
sure if the Allies necessarily 
had the power to do what they 
did, given the 



The question I keep ask- 
ing myself ts, "If you do the 
right thing, for the right reason, 
but do it under objectionable 
circumstances, and make many 
people in the immediate area 
angry, is it still right?" 

Of course, there is more to 
talk about than what is happen- 
ing in Israel. There is a little 
conflict you may have heard 
about, called Operation Iraqi 
Freedom. 

Well, this isn't the first 
time America has been labeled 
as the police of the world. This 
time however, we ousted a mur- 
derous tyrant. 

What's the problem you 
ask? The problem is that we 
were fighting and supporting 
under the assumption that 
Saddam Hussein's regime was 
harboring weapons of mass 
destruction..

'Beauty' remains in the 
eyes of the mindless 



Ignorance is one of the 
most repulsive things on this 
Earth. 

A sad tiling is, most of the 
"beautiful" people I've met are 
dumber than rocks. 

Before you get ahead of 



You can be a literal genius and 
completely ignorant. 

Unfortunately for us, peo- 
ple aren't always judged on 
their ignorance (or lack there- 
of), they are judged on a few 
main points: A) how tight their 
ass is and B) how ample their 
chest looks in a sweater. 

Maybe it is because I 
don't have a penis, qut come on 
guys: blonde, big boobs, tiny 
waist, totally ignorant? How 
can this be diat attractive? 

There is a lot you can tell 
by looking at a person. For 
example, if you looked at me, 
you'd know I'm definitely not 
what most guys would deem 
"hot." Do I care? No, not really. 
Ignorance really isn't a turn on 
for me. To anyone who matters, 
I'm who I am and you accept 
me for just that: me. Dark roots, 
puelyy belly and all. 

However, if you looked at 
me, there are many things about 
me that you'd never be able to 
see. I am an actress, an artist, a 
linguist, a world-traveler and a 
writer. You'd never be able to 
tell that I'm a camper, a hiker, a 
boater and a lifeguard. That's 
right smart-ass; my "fat ass" is 
going to be the one saving 
yours someday.

Well, actually, they ar 
more like snickers and laughs. 

Growing up, dancing was- 
n't something my peers consid- 
ered cool, thus 1 shyed away. 
And there was another, more 
legitimate reason. 1 have no 
coordination. 

A jug of milk has more 
coordination. A broken plate 
Even roadkill has better coordi- 
nation than I. 

But I'm not an inanimate 
object, and I'm alive. So "Ha." 

Now. ballroom dancing is 
becoming popular - at least 
according to my instructors. Of 
course, I think this is said every 
lime a movie about dancing 
takes on any popularity. 

The movie "Singing In the 
Rain" has a great ballroom 
dance scene - but * 
out because there 

s hard to sing and dance 



J.Lo/Richard Gere flick "Shall 
We Dance " 

Now, there are significant 
differences between Richard 
Gere and me. He is significant- 
ly wealthier, significantly more 
talented and significantly more 
famous throughout America. 

And I, unlike Richard 
Gere, significantly have never 
had an urban legend stating I 
once had a hamster up my ass 
No hamsters in my ass. Thank 
you very much. 

Although perhaps it 
would help me dance belter. 

The problem is, aside 
from a lack of coordination, I 
don't hear the rhythm. 1 hear the 
song, the beat, the sounds, but 
my feet can't judge where they 
should be. My legs don't appre- 
ciate moving but staying in 
essentially one place, and my 
hips are on strike. 

Slowly, I've been attempt- 
ing to Icam the basics of dance. 
Apparently, it has something to 
do with "counting" and"num- 
it docs hearing 



it the s 



In the 1980s, dancing 
became "popular" again with 
the movies "Footloose" and 
"Dirty Dancing." Again, neither 
of these movies really captured 
"ballroom dancing" as much as 
they did "hormone dancing." 

In "Footloose." any type 
of dance was against the will of 
God -- along with good music 
as well. (Well, "Let's Hear It 
For The Boy" excluded). 

In "Dirty Dancing," the 
movie showed God can work 
miracles. After its release, both 
Patrick Swayze and Jennifer 
Gray were considered "sex- 
symbols" -- giving hope to even 



edited and responding to the beat. 

Of course, the basics ar 
relatively easy, in-so-much-a 
algebra is relatively easy t 



But 1 am now feeling 
more secure in the steps of 
rumba, (which I'm significantly 
better at with the rum of the ba), 
swing, (which is just hyper- 
chipmunk-dancing) and the 
Waltz -- which is very easy 
once you've learned the rumba. 
The Waltz is the rumba -- 
except you aren't allowed to 
look like you're having a good 



tent, not fantastic. And getting 
my body to look competent is 
about as easy as getting it to fly 
to Neptune. 

Insert your own tacky 
Richard Gere flying to Uranus 
reference here. 

Now, physically, every- 
body needs to dance. We all 
move. Some of us move more 
awkwardly. 

And when I say "some," I 
really mean "me." That's why 
there are such things as classes 
for us. 

risk-taking as boxers and fool- 
ball players. One wrong move, 
and they may be laid up for 
weeks. They really need to be 
able to anticipate what is com- 
ing next ... thus they must have 
years and years of training. 

Or at least a few weeks 
breakin' and a few days in a 
mosh pit. 

Sec, that's probably where 
1 used to dance the best. The 
mosh pit. It's not something I'm 
proud of, but that's the type of 
music I grew up listening to. Of 
course, it's not called "dancing" 
because that would be wussy. 
It's called "moshing." 

In a mosh pit, it's penniss- 
able to plant your elbow into a 
fellow dancer's nose. 

This same move, howev- 
er, is frowned upon during the 
Waltz. 

The band Exodus has a 
song called "The Toxic Waltz," 
Those who dance to it rarely 
looked elegant, but we tend to 
have a good time. There's no 
real maneuvers to learn aside 
from pain lolerance.
