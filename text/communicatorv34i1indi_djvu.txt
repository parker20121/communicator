a need to have a police escort to 
their vehicle for any reason can do

No summer break for IPFW 



By Scott M. Lawson 
and Andrew Wei tie

nd plai 



t project many stu- 



Sometimes, it is a very promi- 
nent, very physical event. 

During the summer of 2003, the 
growth of the IPFW campus was 
evident as construction work grew 
on the shell of a bridge crossing 
Parnell Avenue. And across from 
that bridge, future dormitories 
sprouted from the earth. 

"The campus is doing very 
well," Chancellor Michael Wartell 
said. 

Along with that, over $30 mil- 
lion in new building projects was 
approved by the Indiana General 
Assembly during the summertime. 

With that funding, new build- , 
ings now in the embryonic stage 
for IPFW include a new facility for 
the IU School of Medicine - Fort 
Wayne along with a new music 
building for the School of Music. 

What people see right now are 
the dorms and the bridge, Wartell 

"It's a visible symbol of the kind 
of change that's occurring at IPFW. 
The bridge we keep calling 'the 
bridge to our future,"' Wartell said. 
Dedication of the bridge is initially 
set for Sept 10, while the student 
housing is slated to be done during 
the middle of the summer of 2004, 



Another i 
dents will ni 
in front of Walb Union. 

"It's a little too concrete. We 
want to green that up," Wartell 

The Department of Music is 
planning for a long-anticipated 
new music building, tentatively set 
for early 2007. 

Some features of the new music 
building will include a 400-seat 
recital hall, a choral hall, an instru- 
ment hall, three classrooms, a ded- 
icated music education lab, a com- 
puter tech room, digital piano lab, 
and a recording studio, among 
other facilities. 

"Funding is coming primarily 
from the state of Indiana," Dr. 
Robert Bean said. He is the Chair 
of the Music Department. The 
Indiana legislature approved the 
majority of the $20 to 24 million 
needed for the project, while IPFW 
currently has raised $5.2 million, 
out of the $5 to 6 million for which 
the university is responsible. 

The new music building will be 
quite an upgrade from the old 
auditorium in Neff Hall. "Neff has 
286 seats, so [with the new music 
hall] we are looking at about 400," 
he said. 

A new music hall would mean 
an expanded performance venue, 
one that has a platform as large or 
possibly larger than Neffs audito- 
rium. IPFW could bring in

School days, oh, the parking rules 9 daze 



IPFW 

After spending 20 minutes 
looking and being redirected for a 
parking space ~ then hiking from 
Williams Theatre parking to Kettler 
Hall classes ~ the "commuter- 
aspect of campus becomes obvious. 

Most students drive to the uni- 
versity. But the university doesn't 
have parking for all the students. 
On the first day of classes, people 
were keeping that in mind and tak- 
ing their walks in stride. 

"It's campus, you walk," IPFW 
sophomore Abraham Cochran 
mentioned as he trotted up the 
Walb amphitheater. 

An incoming freshman, 
Amanda Jeter, asserted she dealt 



with being misled three times into 
an already- filled parking garage by 
IPFW police. 

"It took me about 25 minutes to 
find a parking spot," Jeter said. 
"Somehow they need to ' work a 
system so they know and they 
don't keep sending people in," she 

She was told beforehand to 
come in early ~ and she did. She 
said she arrived at 9 a.m. for a 10 
a.m. class and spent about a half- 
hour searching for a spot. 

David Danielson, director of 
IPFW's Physical Plant and Public 
Safety, admits the first few days are 

"It's kind of a zoo," he said. Last 
year, the Physical Plant teamed up 
with IPFW police during the traffic 
jam of week one, he explained. 



"It's our goal to make this! 
as stress free as possible. We'll! 
have signage i 

we'll have people out there-

week," Danielson added.

initial influx of vehicles. They

SAB getting IPFW active 



Photo by Brooke Brvdrick 

Students returned back to school for the fall semester at 
IPFW on Monday, August 25. 



All through the summer, the 
Student Activities Board has been 
busy coordinating events for the 
IPFW community this fall. 

Erin McConaha, Student Body 
Vice President of Programming 
and head of the Student Activities 
Board, said she is most excited 
about the Dave Matthews Cover 
Band, who will be performing 
Sept. 11th. Their concert is sched- 
uled to be held in the Walb Union 
amphitheater at 7 p.m. 

Although the event is free for 
IPFW students, donations to the 
United Way will be accepted at the 
show. The cost for the general 
admission will be about $3. Funds 
raised will be given to the charity. 
This is the first time a concert has 



been planned for the fall instead of 
holding off until the spring. 

During the first week back to 
school, SAB will be holding two 

The first, Wax Concepts, will be 
Wednesday, Aug. 27th from noon 
to 4 p.m. On Thursday, the 
Welcome Back BBQ will be held 
from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and is free to 
IPFW students. Activities will 
include inflatables. Both events 
will be held in the Walb Plaza. 

The Student Activity Board will 
also be part of the Organization 
Fair on Sept. 3 and 4. I 

Members will be there showcas- 
ing things students can do' on cam- 
pus, as well as offering snacks and 
giving away freebies. 

Dr. John Gordon, an Indiana 
University alumnus who special- 
izes in speaking on the 



tions of President |ohn F. Kennedy 
and his brother. Senator Robert 
Kennedy, will be here on Sept. 24 to 
talk about his new book on the 40th 
anniversary of JFK's death.

Globetrotters will be playing an 
exhibition game again the IPFW 
Mastodons at the Coliseum. 

Homecoming Week is Nov. 17 
to 21. Activities will be held all 
over the IPFW campus. This year. 
Homecoming will feature NCAA 
basketball analyst and announcer, 
Dick Vitale. 

McConaha said that the idea to 
bring Vitale to IPFW was brought 
to the attention of SAB by the 
Athletic Department.

on Vitale for Homecoming, the

Time to introduce yourself Welcome to 



For incoming freshmen of the traditional and 
non-traditional student genre, welcome to IPFW. 

We're attending a university with a wide vari- 
ety of academic and social activities taking place 
on a small campus'. It is large enough to have over 
90 student organizations and small enough that 
we can attend most of their meetings with at most 
a ten-minute hike across the grounds. 

For students returning to IPFW after a sum- 
mer of work and dealing with floods, welcome 
back. 

It may seem like just a few minutes ago we fin- 
ished up spring finals, but reality awaits as we 
discover new nooks-and-crannies wliere our class- 
es exist this semester. 

Attending college isn't just about going to 
school. All of us have demonstrated the ability to 
go to school - we've done enough to obtain a high 
school diploma or a GED, 

College isn't just about learning more facts 
and figures. 

It's more important to learn about yourself 

For traditional freshmen, others have tried to 
define you through your lifetime --family mem- 
bers may have called you shy; friends may have 
called you a playa; the media may have called you 
a Harry Potter fanatic. You 've Itad little ability to 
debate such descriptions because your opinion as 
a child and teenager are secondary to the opinions 
of everyone else. 

That all changes now. You're on your own 



deciding your decisions for yourself It 's part self- 
discovery, and part decision making. It's not 
easy. Sometimes it's painful to realize you're not 
who you - and everyone else - thought you were. 

You're not alone in your search for self-deter- 
mination. 

The rest of us are evolving as well. Everyday, 
everyone on this campus has their beliefs chal- 
lenged and opinions shaped by the changes in our 
lives that give us the opportunity to adapt and 
better ourselves. 

We have the ability to concrete our minds and 
Iiearts at any time, but tliat locks the thought 
process and hardens emotions. 

Stagnation isn't good for bodies of water -- 
they turn to swamps. And it's not good for any- 
one between the ages of 8 and 88. If, at any point 
in a life, a person can see they haven't changed at 
all in the prior ten years, then they aren't chal- 
lenging themselves to grow in any way. 

As college studmts, we're paying instructors 
and an institution to challenge us in our knowl- 
edge and our beliefs. Challenging ourselves is as 
important, if not more. 

Over the next year, you will take dozens of 
examinations - but the ones that will really mat- 
ter are the ones that you pose to yourself. 

The answer is only wrong if you're not asking 
the question. 

Welcome, or welcome back to IPFW. Now it's 
time to meet yourself 



Letters To The Editor 



Crossing the line 

When I read the article, "A Nudge in the 'Right' 
Direction", I was appalled. Justin Rentfrow is mock- 
ing that which he obviously knows nothing about. 
There is a fine line between humor and verbal assault, 
and I believe he crossed it. 

Rentfrow first called attention to the Pagan Student 
Alliance, proclaiming it to be a "religiously stunted" 
group worthy of mockery. I am a Christian, but in my 
view, these folks have a right to religious freedom. It 
is not for me, you, or anyone else to pass judgement 
on them due to their religious beliefs. "Bovine sacri- 
fices"? Give me a break. I'm willing to bet that a good 
third of them probably don't even eat meat, let alone 
feel the need to kill another living creature. And the 
comment, "Look for the cars that would probably 
belong to someone making minimum wage." That 
would apply to just about every student on this cam- 
pus, with the possible; exception of those rich kids who 
were given a new car from Daddy. I know several 
pagans (on-and-off campus); for the most part, they 
are a well read and peaceful sort of people. I say live 
and let live.

Thanks for support 

Dear Communicator, 

Hi. My name is Corey, but where I am now it is 
Corporal Campbell. I'm an infantry soldier in the 
Indiana National Guard and have been serving our 
country in Iraq since 8 days after the war started. I'm 
also a fellow student at IPFW and have been since Fall 
of 1999. 

I'm writing you because recently I received a copy- 
of te Communicator from my girlfriend Debbie who is 
also a student at IPFW. After reading an article titled 
"What are they thinking?" written by Justin Rentfrow, 
I wante to send in a letter saying thank you for sup- 
porting fellow soldiers serving in the war. 

After joining the military in 2000, I've missed 3 
semesters of school. Sol was not exactly begging to be 
deployed because of missing school and loved ones. 

Since I've been here I've received a lot of news, both 
good and bad in support of military actions from back 



Sexualities. He believes, that members - of this group 
are sexual deviants who have sex with anything that 
does (or doesn't) move. I take it he has probably never 
been to a United Sexualities meeting. The people who 
attend are not freaks — rather I would say that they are 
a pretty good cross section of the students on campus. 
United Sexualities is a place where gays, lesbians, 
bisexuals, transgendered people, and their friends can 
socialize without fear of hate and ignorance. Straight 
people attend these meetings too. I happen to be one 
of them. A lot of my friends are gay; so what? The 
only difference between them and me is that they hap 
pened to fall in love with someone of the same sex 
rather than the opposite sex. 

I really loved the comment that most drag queens 
are straight. I think Justin is confusing them with 
transvestites, which are really not the same thing at 
all- 
Tell you what, Justin. I'd be happy to take you to 
After Dark sometime ... I'll buy you a beer and intro- 
duce you to some of my friends. There's nothing like 
a dose of education to make a person change his arti- 



in the States. So after reading Justin's article I was very 
happy to read that the majority of Americans are sup- 
porting the troops. 

Justin's points underlined what me and the majori- 
ty of the troops over here believe. He's right to say that 
a lot of time, money, and law enforcement is being 
wasted on escorting unruly anti-war protestors. He is 
also right that moral is the single most important thing 
to a deployed soldier. Not only to their sprirts, but as 
well as to their survival and to hear that there are 
ang(r)y anti-war protestors not supporting the troops 
makes some soldiers question their duty especially if 
it is their peers or fellow students. 

Again, I want to say thank you to a fellow soldier 
and student for writing in support of the troops. And 
I hope when we do come home we may receive a wel- 
come not alike that of past wars such as Vietnam. I 
believe the soldiers have earned it.

"We overfill the hall (in Walb 
Union)," Wartell said. "We'd like to 
put the Omnibus lectures into a 
nice facility like that." 

The campus has needed this 
building for a long time. Wartell 
commented, "We've needed new 
music facilities for a long time. The 
music department is in the base- 
ment of a building (Classroom- 
Medical). It's not much of a show- 
case type of place." 

"I think this has been a dream 
here for quite a number of years. 
We've been in need of it for quite a 
long time," Bean said. 

Planning for a new medical 
education building is also now 
underway. 

"They're working on it," Dr. 
Barth Ragatz said. Ragatz is the 
assistant dean and director of the 
IU School of Medicine Fort Wayne. 

The Indiana General Assembly 
granted a bonding authority for 
the new regional medical center 
for $14 million. 

"They think we could probably 
get this done in a little over two 
years," he said. 

Currently, the department 
teaches the first two years of med- 
ical school in Classroom-Medical 
for over 30 students. 

"We've had an outstanding

able totnese days 
maintain -Dr. Barth Ragatz 

that high- 
quality 

teaching and at the same time we'll 
be able to improve some of the stu- 
dent amenities," he said. 

The research staff will also like- 
ly double in size, he believes — and 
that is a major focus of the effort. 

"Mainly, we'll be able to 
increase phenomally our research 
capacity," Ragatz said. That can 
help the Fort Wayne facility find 
new discovies and increase its sci- 
entific studies, he added. 

It is still in the early stage, but 
he said the medical school is very 
"excited" about the future. The 
cost is not quite set in concrete, he 
explained. 

"It's a little bit like setting out to 
build a new house. You never 
know what it's going to cost you 
until you talk to the architect. The 
two schools of thought are to raise 
more money or to scale down. It's 
a little early for us to know which 
one of these approaches we're 
going to take here," he said. 

"But you can do an awful lot 
with $14 million these days,'* he 

As IPFW grows, the skeleton 
will branch off the main walkway 
that runs north-south in front of 
Helmke Library, Wartell explained. 

"What we intend is to extend 
that spine and just work up north,'' 

Smaller projects are also in the 
works, if not already completed - 
including more signage and the 
landscaping between Walb and 
Helmke Library. 

A marble obelisk is also in the 
planning stages to highlight IPFW 
donors. 

"It's really nice to let them 
know you appreciate them and 
you want it to be in perpetuity," he 

From work this session, IPFW 
owes much to state legislators, 
Wartell said. "They brought proj- 
ects home to northeastern Indiana 
that are really important," he said. 

And in the future, IPFW will 
look at adding onto Gates factlty to 
bring it closer to Walb; and to 
Helmke Library to also bring it 
closer to Walb, Wartell explained. 

There are major utilities to deal 
with, he said, but the university 
would like to "make it a central 
location on campus," the chancel- 
lor said. 



This school year IPFW 
Omnibus Lecture Series is set to 
begin Sept. 8. 

Writer P.). O'Rourke, entertainer 
Ben Vereen, activist Winona 
LaDuke, actor B.D. Wong, essayist 
Richard Rodriguez and writer 
Joyce Carol Oates are slated to 
speak during the 2003-2004 school 

IPFW communications special- 
ist Anne Weissner said the series - 
in its ninth year — is committed to 
bringing well-known people of 
diversity, races, cultures, topics and 
expertise to IPFW and the north- 
eastern Indiana community. 

The free lectures are normally 
set at 7:30 p.m. in the Walb Union 
Ballroom. 

"The exciting part about this 
series is it brings in people with 
different diverse backgrounds and 
perspectives. In doing this they 
can present some ideas and issues 
that maybe people in Fort Wayne 
have not thought about before," 



IVeis 






P.J. O'Rourke will speak Sept. 8. 
He was rescheduled in April 
because he was overseas reporting 
on the second war with Iraq. 
According to Weissner, his agent 
offered to send someone else to 
speak but because of the public's 
desire to see O'Rourke, IPFW 
decided to reschedule him to open 
this season. 

In his latest book, "The CEO of 
the Sofa," O'Rourke writes about 
what he considers the most fright- 
ening place of all - his own home. 
Both Time and The Wall Street 
Journal have named him "the fun- 
niest writer in America," according 
his biography.

for his appearace in the television 
movie "Roots." 

According to his bio, the 
American Guild of Variety Artists 
named Vereen to a trio of its 
awards all in the same year -- mak- 
ing him the first performer to reach 
such an achievement. He was 
named as the Entertainer of the 
Year; Song and Dance Star of the 
Year and Rising Star of the Year. 
Vereen will appear Thursday, Oct. 
2 at IPFW. 

Vereen will cover conquering 
adversity, arts and entertainment, 
black history, motivation, and the 
value of continuing education, 
according to the Omnibus web- 
page. 

In November, author and envi- 
ronmental advocate Winona 
LaDuke is scheduled to speak. She 
is currently the program director of 
Honor the Earth. She is a founder 
and former co-chairperson of the 
Indigenous Women's Network 
along with a former board member 
of Greenpeace USA. 

LaDuke writes about native and 
human rights subjects. She has 
been written about in magazines 
People, Sierra, and E. LaDuke was 
named Woman of the Year by Ms. 
magazine in 1997. 

Her series, called "Politics, 
Motherhood, and Environmental 
Justice from a Native Perspective," 
is programmed for Tuesday, 
November 18th. 

The younger television audi- 
ences might be familiar with B.D. 
Wong. Wong is best know for his 
role in "Oz" the HBO series as a 
Catholic priest and a psychiatrist 
on NBC's "Law and Order: Speci.il 
Victims Unit." 

Weissner says this is a great 
opportunity. She believes the actor

lize north campus lots -• and not vulture for spots near 
Kettler or Neff Halls. 

"Stop at the first open spot you see. Don't cruise the 
lots. It adds to traffic," he added. "People get so irritat- 
ed with us because they want to go to Kettler Hall. 
There's no parking .it Kettler ! I. ill," Denhartog noted. 

Danielson concurred with Denhartog. 

"Just stay north," Danielson noted. Some students 
don't even realize there are lots on the north side of cam- 
pus, he added. "Come five minutes earlier, and park 
north," he reitnerated. 

Every year, there are efforts made to assist in parking 
troubles. In recent years, the student population of IPFW 
is increasing in double-digit percentages. With the stu- 
dents come their cars. According to Danielson, about 300 
new parking places have been paved this year - but he 
estimates there may be over 400 cars looking for asphalt 
this fall. During the summer, two new lots were added, 
and a third was renovated. 

"The problem we have is more of a perception prob- 
lem. There's enough parking on campus, but there's not 
enough parking where the -.Indent's want it," he said. 

Danielson admitted there were times last year where 
IPFW parking was maxed-out. "Three days (last year), 
we filled up every space we had on campus ... it's kind 
of scary," he said. Most students understood parking 
problems during IPFW's first week of classes are com- 
mon-- when several have different experiences. 

"Many students are having parking problems," soph- 
omore Naru Harvey said. 

Junior Vince Murphy said he tells incoming students 
to be prepared for the parking situation. "You just wait 
until someone leaves," he said, "People are fighting for 
spots, everybody has got to get to class," Murphy added. 

"They could probably make another parking garage," 
Harvey suggested. 

Harvey's thoughts aren't too far from the future situ- 
ation. With several new facilities in the embryonic stage 
for the north side of campus, IPFW may look at building 
a new parking garage in the coming years. 

"Parking decks take up a smaller footprint and hold 
many more cars," Danielson said. 

The clogged-parking phenomenon does traditionally 
loosen after the first few weeks of courses. Denhartog 
thinks students show up during the first few weeks to 
take care of administrative needs or social gatherings. 
They are trying to get to know the campus - and trying 
to acclimate themselves to a habit, he says. 

'Two weeks down the road, that's all over. Drop-add 
is done. They're not seeing advisors. They're settled into 
a routine," Denhartog considers. 

That's going to take a few weeks. 

"I think in a way it's a bad thing, but it's also hilari- 
ous," Murphy said.

ODE TO THE STUDENT ACTIVITIES BOARD 

- by comedian Michael Dean Ester 

Nominated 2002 NACA "Comedy Entertainer of the Year" 

We line up the dates and do the publicity for every imaginable student activity. 

We do the most to improve the student body attitude and we get the least amount of student body 

gratitude. 

We provide a vital service that our campus deserves - Special events for when books and classes 

get on our nerves. 

Our school supports the fine work that we do. You should see the office they gave us - no win- 

dows,no view. 

It's hard to know what our school is really thinking. They keep raising tuition, but our budget 

keeps shrinking. 

It's a thankless job, but someone's got to do it. We go to NACA Conferences to learn tips to get 

through it. 

We plan carnivals, casino nights, concerts, and events - 

we arrange shows in the student center and hold functions in tents. 

We bring our school music and comedy and lectures, too, And then still people bitch that there's 

"nothing to do. " 

But the truth of our job at the end of the day is that it's not about praise and it's not about pay. 

We add to the quality of life at our schools. The events that we program can be great learning 

tools. 

Being a student goes on well after class. And campus life with no programs would be a pain in 

the - butt. 

Imagine if textbooks were the only thing ever seen. No events, arts, or culture to experience in 

between. 

Imagine if the activities board weren't here. ..college would be high school - with tuition and beer. 

When students meet members who plan events on this board, 

they should thank God we're working or they would really be bored. 

Here's some advice to fellow students, who don't attend events they see here: 

"You already paid the activities fee - it's kind of stupid not to be here!" 

College events make college memories - a changed heart or genuine thrill 

Students should stop and thank a board member, although no one ever will. 

Professors work for tenure, administrators work for prudence. 

But we bring this campus to life -for the good of ALL the students. 

And for those who may think the "programming pride" we feel is funny 

Just remember while you're laughing - we're spending all your money!

First Person 



After jail, don't drop the soap 



By Joshua Krueckeberg 

Special to The Communicator 

"Krueckeberg. 224. Bed and 
Baggage!" a stark voice echoed 
through the food hall and bounced 
off the wails inside my cell. 

It was 4:30 in the morning on 
my 45th day in the Hamilton 
County Jail. And on my way to 
freedom, as I walked down the 
stairs and towards the guarded 
front door, I felt cheated. 

Forget everything you've seen 
about jail in the movies and on TV. 
Forget about the 'don't drop the 
soap in the shower' cliches. Forget 
about the homemade knives, 
carved from plastic silverware, slic- 
ing someone's throat at chow-time. 
It's tough, but not too tough, not 
that tough. At least it wasn't for 
me. Not in the B-Block of the 
Hamilton County Jail. 

The first thing I learned in jail 
was justice is not equal. Ralphie, a 
small, smiling black man was serv- 
ing 30 days for a first-offense driv- 
ing on a suspended license charge. 
He couldn't wait to get out to see 
his 3-month-old baby. He talked 
about her night and day. I didn't 
have the heart to tell him, but a 
friend of mine had just been sen- 
tenced in Fort Wayne for the same 
charge (he even had multiple 
offenses) and all my friend 
received was a minima! fine and no 
jail time. Justice let Ralphie down. 

The B-BIock was full of short- 
timers. Small change alcohol, drug 
and traffic violators. No one serv- 
ing more than 180 days. Not too 
many felony violators. Our cells 
didn't even have doors on them. It 
was an open block. Eight bunks 
per cell and a misleading amount 
of freedom. 

There was no huge open show- 
er aTea, but instead eight private 
shower stalls. They were not, how- 
ever, referred to as shower stalls. 
They were simply the "jack-a- 
shacks," because we all know what 
boys do in private - especially in 
the absence of a woman. With pri- 
vacy so clearly at a premium, the 
'shacks' served their purpose. 

The second thing I learned in 



jail was justice is unfair. Dylan, a 
young, ex-quarterback, frat boy 
was incarcerated on a parapherna- 
lia charge. He had no considerable 
quantity of marijuana in his pos- 
session at the time of the arrest. 
The judge refused to set a bond and 
set a trial date for two //j . • 
months after Dylan's JUStlCe IS MOf droolim ,_ 



pie on probation. A county 'hat 
some defense lawyers refuse to 
work in. A county that preys on 
one of its biggest moneymakers, 
the Verizon Wireless Music Center. 
The third thing I learned in jail 
was justice can be dead wrong.

The first few days back at 
school can be a confusing time for 
students - especially after receiv- 
ing the bill for purchasing used 

"Urn, seven books for $34346? 
Can that be right?" 

"Well, you do get a free box of 
crayons with any purchase over 
$45." 

For those returning to campus 
for their second freshman, sopho- 
more, second sophomore, junior, 
senior, second senior or third sen- 
ior year, there is very little that is 
intimid.iting about IPFW - aside 
from grade cards. 

For those fresh-faced freshman 
straight from high school, or for 
those kids starting their lives with 
some college education, it's impor- 
tant that we - the slightly-better 
informed - give some nt our slighl- 
ly-informed knowledge. 

So here is my input; avoid step- 
ping in the goose poo. 

Sure, you were thinking it was 
going to be some high-minded 
mantra about attending classes or 
studying two hours for every hour 
of coursework you attend, but 
someone with a higher CPA should 
advise you of those beliefs. 

From me: avoid stepping in the 
goose poo. 

I don't say that just because 
Cgoose poo is fun to type. There 
is a legitimate reason to make peo- 
ple aware of goose poo. There is a 
significant amount of it on IPFW 
sidewalks and streets.

cleaning crews of IPFW. I can't

don't step in it. 

And if you do step in it, don't 
blame any stray dogs or cats. It's 
the geese. For some reason, they 
prowl in their gaggle like a gang 
looking to start ,. pecking war with 
the local flock of ducks. 

There are a few things to know 
about the college you've chosen. 

It is called Indiana University 
Purdue University Fort Wayne. 
("Indiana" and "Purdue" were 
iken.) For 



the only team that would he intim- 
idated by the Squirrels would be 
the Nuts. 

On campus, you will become 
accustomed to a variety of build- 
ings named alter people who have 
been good to IPFW. 

There is Walb Student Union, 
named after Mr. Walb; Kettler I lall, 
named after Mr. Kettler; and 
Classroom-Medical Building, 

named after Mrs. Classroom- 
Medical (she was one of those "lib- 
erated" women who refused to 
drop her maiden name). 

It would be naive to say any 
campus is perfect. It can be noted 
that there are some annoyances 
with which most of us will deal. 

This campus is not unique in its 
parking problems. Similar park- 
ing troubles lake place every year 
at IU, Purdue and Phish concerts. 
Parking troubles at I'hish concerts 
tend to be much more relaxed - 
with more l-'rito bags than book

However, after about a month 
or so, parking on campus tends to 
loosen up a bit. This is due, in 
part, to students discovering better 
time management, dropping class- 
es, and a used car dealership that 
always tries to sell their vehicles in 
the parking garages. 

Parking alleviates itself after 
about the first month of class, but 
re-congests as the winter term 
begins. 

This is actually much more 
aggravating because- speaking tor

bombed the first six tests by the 
first day's roll call. 

And that makes for a goose poo 
of a first school day for me back at

out and not step in it as I walk 
between Mr. Kettler's hall and Mrs.

IPFW football remains a fall fantasy 



By Nick West 

The Communicator 

Imagine standing in the parking 
lot outside of a new IPFW outdoor 
stadium. You just threw some hot- 
dogs and hamburgers on a grill. 

To the left, a few friends toss a 
football back and forth. To the 
right, 30-something men discuss a 
star athlete's performance from last 

Laughter arises a few feet away. 
Some guys from around campus 
got a bit carried away with school 
spirit and painted their faces and 
torsos blue and white. Past the 
school spirit fanatics, another 
group toss chicken wings on their 
grill and sip cold beverages. They 
are painted blue and white, too. 

Across the parking lot, someone 
has painted "Go Dons!" on their 
car's windows. 

The entire lot is a sea of blue 
and white. The season starts today, 
and everyone is stoked. It has been 
eight months since the last game 
was played. Shaken from the 
momentary bliss, the coot autumn 
breeze has tempted your nostrils 
with the smell of the now fully 
grilled food. 

Better eat up; game time is in 30 
minutes. 

This weekend, college football 
will kickoff into another season. 
Every Saturday from now until 
December will be packed with 
shootouts and blowouts, rivalries 
and camaraderies, parodies and 
tragedies, heartbreakers and Hail 
Mary's — and the much-lauded 
Heisman talk. 

But not here. Not now.

At Baylor, Bliss is to blame 



Today in sports, there are a lot of ques- 

Should Bonds or Pujols be the MVP of 
baseball? Will Kobe be convicted of sexual 
assault? Do the Bengals have a chance this 
year in the NFL? The list could go on and on. 

But how about this one: Is Dave Bliss a 
modem day Benedict Arnold? Look up the 
word "traitor" in the dictionary, sometimes 
the term "benedict" will pop up in the "also 
see" section. In the future versions of it, I 
wouldn't be surprised to see the name Dave 
Bliss in that section. 

Bliss, the former Baylor head basketball 
coach, brainwashed his players into lying to 
investigators about the murder of teammate 
Patrick Dennehy and possible NCAA viola- 
tions. He assured them the investigators 
were on their side and their "testimonies" 
would help save the program. Bliss' scheme 
was simple; use people and cover your sadis- 
tic self. 

The program was already in shambles 
after player Carlton Dotson confessed to the 
FBI about murdering teammate Patrick 
Dennehy. 

The case was and still is surrounded by a 
flurry of questions. How and why did the 
two get guns? Were they really threatened by 
teammates and other students? Dennehy 
was missing for 38 days; how long had he 
been dead? Why did Dotson kill teammate, 
roommate, and good friend Dennehy? This 
list could go on and on, too. 



But just when things seemingly couldn't 
get worse for the program, Baylor investiga- 
tions discovered improper payments to two 
players and improper handling of drug tests, 
clear violations of NCAA policy, by Bliss. 

It has to be pretty easy to use someone 
who is really close. In this case, the user was 
a second or even first father figure. 

I mean, isn't that what head coaches are? 
When a student athlete is far away from 
home, in whom do they confide? When the 
game-winning shot is missed, who uplifts 
that player? When it is made, who is the first 
to congratulate him? When a girlfriend or 
class work becomes too much, who is always 
there? 

The Baylor basketball players had to be 
distraught over the murder of a fellow team- 
mate by another teammate. So whom did 
they go to for comfort? Bliss. 

Not only did he use his players to cover 
his NCAA violations, but the murder conspir- 
acy, too. Their melancholy words and misery 
fell on deaf ears and a heartless chest. And 
when their loyalty wasn't enough to cover his 
behind, Bliss resigned; leaving his players 
confused and betrayed. 

Each player has a waiver to leave the uni- 
versity and play this upcoming season for a 
different college. 

A few have already left, including the best 
player on the team. The program is in sham- 
bles and it's all Dave Bliss' fault. Yeap, the 
"this, that" sibling blame game works this 
time. Dave Bliss this, Dave Bliss that. It's his 
entire fault, right? It sure is.

It's time for 
NCAA football 
predictions 

By Nick West 

The Communicator 

I am one of the biggest football 
fans around. NFL, college, or high 
school, it doesn't matter; just point 
me to the gridiron. With this col- 
umn, I will give you all my predic- 
tions for the top players, teams, 
conferences, and games all season 
long. I'll kick off the school year 
with my college predictions. 

My pre season Heisman candi- 
dates. Good chance: Cody 
Pickett, QB, Washington; Eli 
Manning, QD, Mississippi; Philip 
Rivers, QB, North Carolina State; 
Ell Roberson, QB, Kansas State; 
Steven Jackson, RB, Oregon Stale; 
Kevin Jones, RB, Virginia Tech; 
Chris Gamble, WR/CB, Ohio 
State; Roy Williams, WR, Texas. 

Darkhorses; John Navarre. QB, 
Michigan; Brad Smith, QB, 
Missouri; Greg [ones, KB, Florida 
State; Frank Gore, RB, Miami; 
Darren Sproles, RB, Kansas State; 
Larry Fitzgerald, WR, Pittsburgh; 
Mike Williams, WR, USC; Reggie 
Williams, WR, Washington; Kellen 
Winslow Jr., TE, Miami. 

Besides, the perennial top 5-10 
teams, here are my other teams to 
watch out for. 

Oregon State - They are on the 
edge of the top 25 and will likely 
crack it after victories in the first 
two weeks. Running back Steven 
Jackson is a Heisman candidate 
and the Derek Alexander-James 
Newson combo will be torching 
PAC 10 defenses all season, 
; Purdue - Ranked #19 or #22 
depending on whose poll your 
looking at. Joe Tiller is a great 
offensive mind and has the 
weapons to compete this year. 
Kyle Orton is the QB and will be 
throwing all over the Big Ten. 

Senior starting running back 
Joey Harris has been ruled aca- 
demically ineligible, and impres- 
sive junior Brandon Jones must 
show he can handle the full load 
and take pressure off the passing 
game. The Boilers D is solid up the 
middle. 

LSU- The quarterback compe- 
tition is actually encouraging as 
both players can start and pro- 
duce, especially with Michael 
Clayton and Devery Henderson to 

Conference Winners: ACC - 
N.C. State; Big 12 
Oklahoma/Kansas State; Big East 
- Pittsburgh Big Ten - Michigan; 
Conference USA - Texas Christian 
(TCU);MAC- Marshall Mountain 
West - Colorado State PAC 10 - 
W,ishington;SEC - Auburn;Sun 
Belt - North Texas; WAC - Boise 
State. 

Sugar Bowl prediction: 
Michigan vs. Oklahoma 

Predictions for this weekend's 
big games: #9 USC at #6 Aubum. 
Carson Palmer and Troy Palamalu 
graduated and were first round 
NFL picks. If that doesn't say 
enough about their talent and 
USC's loss, then I don't know what 
does. USC has stud wideout Mike 
Williams, but he can't throw the 
ball to himself or play defense. 
Auburn has the best running back 
quartet (Yes, four stud backs) in 
the country and a solid defense. 
Prediction: Aubum. 
#19 Washington at #1 Ohio State. 
Washington has the talent to com- 
pete with Ohio State, but how will 
they respond to a new head coach? 
Without suspended running back 
and former Heisman favorite 
Maurice Clarett, Ohio State may 
have trouble establishing a solid 
run game. Ohio State's defense is 
still tough, but Washington QB 
Cody Pickett will find Reggie 
Williams for two touchdowns and 
the Huskies will pull out a victory 
in game that will have everyone on 
the edge of their seat. Prediction: 
Washington. 

Next week will be NFL predic- 
tions and some fantasy football 
tips for all of you fantasy lovers

'Premiere preseason event 1 



Soccer Showcase 
at Hefner brings 
about 12,000 fans 



Gavin Chura's T-shirt used an 
Mils' cliche to sum up the prevailing 
attitude at Hefner Fields last week- 

On the first line, it said: "This is 
your brain." Followed by a soccer 



The 13-year-old and a half 

dozen of his friends were among 
the thousands in attendance dur- 
ing the 72-hour Soccer Showcase at 
IPFW's Hefner Fields. A total of 13 
mens and women's college soccer 
matches, along with high school 
and youth program games, jam- 
borees and invitationals took place 
during the Aug. 22-24 event. 

"I love football, but soccer is 
more fun because it never stops," 
Chura, a Fort Wayne resident, said. 

His soccer teammate, 12-year- 
old Kegan Harkenrider, agreed. 
He said he was pleased to have the 
opportunity to watch so many 
renowned teams during the week- 
end. 

"It's fun to come out here and 
watch games. I'm going to be here 
everyday," Harkenrider said. 

The IPFW Soccer Showcase, in 



its fourth year, had an estimated 
crowd of 12,000, according to ath- 
letic director Mark Pope. 

Along with the crowd, there 
were over 400 college players tak- 
ing to the fields. 

Perennial college soccer power- 
houses Indiana University and the 
University of North Carolina were 
among the schools featured, along 
with the IPFW men's and women's 
programs. 

IU head coach Jerry Yeagley, 
who was honored Saturday night 
for his years of involvement with 
college soccer, was again 
impressed with the IPFW Soccer 
Showcase. 

"It's a wonderful event. From a 
coaching standpoint, you couldn't 
ask for more. Great fields, great 
environment," Yeagley said. 

He added the community has 
advanced and improved the Soccer 
Showcase. 

"Fort Wayne, IPFW - I applaud 
them. They've done a tremendous 
job in nurturing this. In four years, 
it's gotten better every year. It is 
the premiere preseason event of its 
kind. Every college coach thinks 
it's a great event and wants to be 
here. I'm glad I was a part of the 
start of it," Yeagley continued. 

Teams included along with 
IPFW were women's crews from 
Purdue, Butler, Kentucky, UNC, 
Ohio State, Michigan, Central 
Michigan and Cincinnati along 
with men's programs from IU, 
Kentucky, Rutgers, Michigan State, 
and Dayton. 

Terry Stefankiewicz, head coach 
of both IPFW men's and women's 




were playing at the same time 
on adjoining fields. 

"They were playing side- 
by-side and they both won - so 
that was a great thing for them," 
Stefankiewicz said. 

The University of North 
Carolina women's team swept 
their games — even without 
four starters who are attempt- 
ing to make the National team. 
They defeated Michigan, 4-1 
and then held on to best Ohio 
State, 3-2.

child" of the weekend, Yeagley 

"He deserves the lion's share of 
the credit," he said. 

The IPFW coach was able to cel- 
ebrate with one victory for the 
weekend — the first win a 
Mastodon squad has had 



goal in front of the folks here, but 
we've got a long way to go," 
Yeagley said of the upcoming sea- 
son - his last -- with IU.

achievements through the years,

He was also impressed with the

fields during the weekend. 

"We put in an extra thousand

Stefankiewicz said. 

He was also impressed with . 

what he called beautiful weather ^, 

and beautiful fields.

And while he steps into his 

retirement season, youngsters at 

the Showcase debated why soccer

The answer is simple, really. 
Outside of the U.S.A., it is less a 
sport and more an orientation. 

"They start when they can 
walk," Gavin Chura said. 



IPFW teams split Showcase matches 



The IPFW women's team shut 
out Central Michigan University 
for the Mastodon program's first 
ever win at the Soccer Showcase. 

The 2-0 victory snapped the 
winless streak the IPFW teams 
endured at their home preseason 
showcase since it began four years 
ago. The IPFW women's team has 
played in it three of the four years ■ 
- and Saturday afternoon was their 
initial victory. 

The Mastodon's coach, Terry 
Stefankiewicz, was visibly thrilled 
with the blanking of the 
Chippewas. 

'That was exciting," he said. 

The team this year is dominated 
in numbers by underclassmen, and 
they made their presence known. 
"We felt like it's the best freshman 
class by far that we've ever had," 
Stefankiewicz said. 

IPFW's underclassmen scored 
its two goals in the second half - 
the first coming from Alyssa Bailey. 
The freshman's unassisted score 
happened during its 61st minute. 



Bailey had some struggles early 
on in the practices, the coach said. 
"It made me feel good that Alicia 
Bailev scored ... every day she's 
getting better and better," 
Stefankiewicz noted. 

Sophomore Kristin Lindberg 
added a second goal late in the 
match with her goal at 78:27. 
Freshman Kristin Mahoney earned 
the assist on the goal. 

The duo is a good for the 
Mastodons, the coach explained. 
One is strong and the other quick. 
"So they combine really, really 
well," he said. 

Stefankiewicz said the team 
expects good things during this 
upcoming season. 

"The girls are so excited about 
the season. I try to tell them to take 
it one game at a time, but they are 
anticipating really, really big 
things," he explained. 

And that attitude is infectious. 

"Our goal is to have a winning

and continue to work hard, I think 
they'll have an outstanding sea- 
son," Stefankiewicz said.

Peaslee fights for posses- 
sion Saturday. 



Stefankiewicz said the Flyers 
are a quality squad. "They're a 
really high level team," he said. 

Dayton scored in the 10th 
minute of the competition, and 
again during the 65th minute of 
play. With just under two minutes 
remaining, IPFW senior Garrett 
Buck put the Mastodons on the 

"Garrett Buck's goal, that was 
awesome. He's one of the best lead- 
ers we've ever had," the coach said. 

He used the day to give many 
new players experience, he added. 

"We're able to use a lot of kids. 
We kept our most technical players 
in the whole game and the rest we 
kept fresh," Stefankiewicz 
explained. 

He said much was learned in 
the exhibition game against 
Dayton. "We were a little bit tenta- 
tive from time-to-time, but we held 
our own." Their regular season 
begins when they take on 
Centenary on Saturday, and then 
uUPUI on Sunday at the IUPU1 
Classic in Indianapolis. Start time 
for both matches is slated for 
2:30p.m.
