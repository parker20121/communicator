NEWS BRIEFS 

NGUYEN CHANGES PLEA 
TO NOT GUILTY 

Kha Nguyen, who was charged wiih 
the December slaying of visiting profes- 
sor Maurice Lam, changed his pica to 
not guilty at his sentencing. 

The crimes Nguyen previously plead- 
ed guilty to include aiding in a felony 
murder, nine counts of thefi and aiding 
in theft, and burglary. 

Allen County Prosecutor Stephen 
Sims reached a plea agreement in April 
recommending Nguyen receive a 49 
year prison term in exchange for his 
guilty pleas. 

Prosecution predicted the agreement 
would sway Nguyen to testify against 
alleged conspirators Ko Jin Soh, who 
faces ttial in October, and Ben Blauvelt, 
who is still at large. 

Nguyen's decision to plead not guilty 
at his sentencing came as a shock to 
Sims after Nguyen originally pleaded 
guilty and led authorities lo the body. 
Sims planned to have him testify 
against Soh. 

"Certainly we're in a substantially 
weaker position," Sims said. He added 
he does not intend to lose this case. 

Allen Superior Court Judge John 
Surbeck will set a trial date for 
Nguyen Sept. 12 when he appears at a 
status hearing. 

MATH TEAM VICTORIOUS 
OVER WEST LAFAYETTE 

IPFW placed second, above Purdue at 
West Lafayette, at the Indiana College 
Mathematics Competition. 

The event, which took place in the 
spring, consisted of students from 24 
teams from 12 colleges and universi- 
ties. Each team works on a set of eight 
problems for two hours. They then dis- 
cuss the situations, and together form 
joint solutions, 

IPFW's team members who placed 
second were '92 graduates Mark 
Dragan and Jeff Gerardot, and Senior 
Aaron Petski. 

First place was taken by one of five 
teams from Rose-Hulman Institute of 
Technology- One of two Purdue teams 
from West Lafayette placed third. 

Other participating schools were four 
teams from Wabash College, two from 
Butler, three from the University of 
Indianapolis, two teams from 
Valparaiso University, Goshen College, 
Earlham College, Ball State University, 
and St. Mary's College. 

Solve this problem that was presented 
in the competition: 

A collection of gossips each knows a 
unique tidbit of scandal not known lo 
any of the others. They communicate 
by mailing letters. Of course each gos- 
sip will share all of the scandal he or 
she knows at that time whenever he 
sends a letter. If there are no gossips, 
show with (with proof) the minimum 
number of letters that suffices for every 
gossip to know all of the scandal. 

PHILHARMONIC TO HOST 
FESTIVAL IN FORT WAYNE 

On Saturday, September 5lh, the Fort 
Wayne Philharmonic will present 
"Stardust: Classic American Song". As 
an official event of the Auburn-Cord- 
Duesenbcrg Festival, this concert marks 
the first festival event to be held in Fort 
Wayne. The concert will be held at the 
historic Embassy Theatre in downtown 
Fort Wayne and will begin at 8:00 p.m. 

"Stardust: Classic American Song" 
will feature the music of Cole 
Porter, Hoagy Carmichael, Stephen 
Foster, Jerome Kern, Duke Ellington 
and other champions of the Classic 
American Song. Guest artists will 
include Gene Benoncini, Guitar and 
Daniel Kurek, Tenor.

IPFW improvements nearing completion

Consiniction projects may hin- 
der traffic for a while, but the 
new entrance should case iraffic 
congestion in the long run. said 
Katier. director of ihc Physical 
Plant. 

TTie construction crew ran into 
some soft spots while excavating 
and delayed progress on the new 
entrance. However, the base 
asphalt shoiiJd be in place within 
a couple weeks, according to 
Kaiier. 

Kaucr said they expected the 
new entrance to open around 



November, 

"We have lo wait for the con- 
struction on ihe south bound 
lanes of 37 to be completed. 
Hopefully , we can pave at the 
same time so ihcy can run ihcir 
asphalt right up !o the entrance." 
said Kallcr. 

Addressing speculation on the 
closing of the left turn lane at the 
Coliseum Boulevard entrance, 
Kauer said, "Once ihe new 
entrance opens, the left turn lane 
into the oiher Crescent Avenue 
entrance will close. But as of now 
there arc no plans to close the 
Coliseum Boulevard entrance." 



In addition, the Engineering 
Technology Building is gelling 
close to completion, according lo 
Kaiter. 

"Some classes will stay in Neff 
Hall until next semester. A lot of 
Ihe lab classes have equipment 
that is 100 heavy lo move into the 
building while the semester is 
slill in progress. 

"However, some classes may 
move before the semester is up," 
said Katter. 

The Fine Arts Building and the 
new theater are also undergoing 
improvements. The lecture 
hall, room 204. in the Fine Arts 



Building was compleied ihis 
summer, although the permanent 
furnishings for the room are not 
expected for another two weeks, 
according to Kauer. 

"We had lo open ihe building 
with the room still unfinished 
because we didn't have ihc 
money to finish it last semester," 
said Kauer. 

Kaltcr also said that outside 
light fixtures for the area were 
expected to arrive within a couple 
weeks. 

"We ordered the light fixtures on

New police chief in office now, 
hopes to increase campus safety 



By Mike Wade 
Managing Editor 

Last April Richard Ritchie, vice 
chancellor of finance, announced 
Ihe appoiniment of Lauren 
DenHanog as chief of police at 
IPFW. 

The appoinimeni was effective 
May 1. 

"Lauren has over fifteen years 
of experience at the IPFW cam- 
pus and has disUnguishcd him- 
self as a hardworking, enthusias- 
tic memlx;r of the E&gt;cpartment of 
UnivcRiiy Police and Safety, He 
is and will continue to be a 
tremendous asset to Ihe campus 



and a credit to our organiza- 
tion." said Ritchie in his 
announcement. 

DenHanog said he was pleased 
with his appointment to the post. 
"I'm excited. We have a very 
good group of employees who 
are making a lot of good 
changes, and I think things are 
really looking up," said 
DenHanog. 

The police are still working on 
a self study to help the dcpan- 
ment recognize its strengths and 
weaknesses, and provide a beticr 
understanding of what still needs 
to be done, according to 




blown away by a tornado." said 
Kaiter. 

"Anyway, there should be more 
outside light ihan we had last 
semester," concluded Katter. 

Also, Kaiter said the university 
still had some minor construction, 
such as sidewalks and curbs, to 
finish. 

"Students may have noticed 
some big squares missing from 
the sidewallts. The squares will 
evcniually be brick, like the park- 
ing garage cnUancc. When all the 
cement has been laid, ihc brick 
layer will come in and fill in ihe 
squares." said Katter. 



First week hassles 
affect everybody 



lly Mary Shrock 
Features Editor 

Monday was a busy day on the 
IPFW campus. 

Between 300 and 400 people 
scrambled lo get at the head of 
ihc line early Monday morning 
in the Bursar's office. 

Over 3 million dollars was 
handed to students in need of 
financial assistance. 

Parking lots ovcrllowed. 

Thousands of eager students 
wailed in line at FoHctt's book 
store. 

"It's nothing unusual," noted 
Pamela Michalec IPFW's 
Bursar "The fii^t week is always 
busy." 

First year student, Brian 
Kinligh, addressed the four 
biggest problems students face ai 
the beginning of a school year 
here. 

"1 didn't get the class I wanted. 
Then I wailed two and a half 
hours in the financial aid line. 
But worst of all, the parking was 
a drag," Kinligh said. He noted 
also that his books were quite 
expensive. 

Ron Wyckoff, manager of 
Pollen's said, "Monday is the 
day everything is available, bui 
the last two weeks we've sold a 
lot of books." 

Wyckoff also said he had lo hire 
25 cxua workers lo handle all of 
the extra business. 

Mike Nctlcrvillc, a senior, said 
the lines weren't too bad at 
Follei's but he was shocked by 
the t&gt;ook prices, 

"The prices ate outrageous. 
None of the classes 1 signed up 
for had used books. Every book I 
bought was brand new," 
Nettcrvillc said. 

"Otherwise, everything else has 
been going okay. But the book- 
store pisses me off," added 
Neiierville, "I know I'm going 
to drop a couple hundred bucks 



and then when 1 go lo sell them 
back, I'll get Ihrec dollars." 

Nettcrvillc, like many IPFW 
students, said he didn't gel many 
of the classes he warned. 

"I didn't get anything. Bui ii 
was my fault. 1 registered late. 
I'm slill trying lo get some of the 
classes I need," Neiierville said. 

Rudy Svoboda, assistant dean 
of arts and sciences, offers this 
advice to students, "Register 

"It's nothing unusual. The 
first week is always busy." 
-Pamela Michalec 

early! Don't let it go until the last 
minute. ' he said. 

University police chief. Lauren 
Dcnhanog also advised that stu- 
dents should get used to parking 
rules soon, 

"We give the students the first 
week Id acclimate. But if we give 
them loo much lime, they take 
advantage," Dcnhanog said. 

He noicd thai a new parking 
permit system has helped cut 
down on the hassles of having to 
wait in line for parking permits. 

Now parking permits are being 
sent through the mail, 

"It's much better for the stu- 
dents." said Dcnhartog. 

Second year student and volley- 
ball player, Carol Lamarr said, 
'The hardest pan was financial 
aid, I had to wait an hour just 
gctung the paperwork done." 

Jim Poner, who works for the 
Learning Resource Center said, 
"It's hectic all over the place. 
Classes arc switching to different 
rooms and people don't know 
where they're going," 

"It's all very chaotic." Poner 
added, "This year it's even more 
hectic because there are so many 
students, and we don't have 
room forlhem."

DenHanog. 

"With the self study we've cre- 
ated a mission statement which 
is, 'To protect and serve die cam- 
pus community by providing a 
safe environment through 
enforcement, service, and educa- 
tion.' It just lets everybody 
know what we want to accom- 
plish," said DenHartog. 

In addition to the appointment 
of a new chief, some other 
changes have taken place in the 
strucuire of the department. 

The police hired two new offi- 
cers, Scott Teguneyer and Glen 
Wills, since July. That gives the 
department one more pohce ofTi- 
ccr than it had last year, accord- 
ing to DenHartog. 

When DenHanog was appoint- 
ed as chief of police, officer Ron 
Moi2 was promoted to sergeant. 

Two students are also being 
recruited to help out the force, 

"Student patrols will help us 
interact with the student commu- 
nity. It's also an inexpensive way 
to give the deparunent an extra 
sci of eyes and cars," said 
DenHanog, 

'The students won't be writing 
uckcls, but they will be helping 
with duties such as jump start 
service and our cscon service," 
said DenHanog. 



Library eliminates 
card catalog as other 
changes are made 



By Jim Walker 
Editor in Chief 

The limes they are a changin" 
at Helmke Library. 

According to Judy Violeite, 
assistant director of the library, 
Helmke has moved into the 
information age by eliminating 
all togeUier the card catalog. 

Now students can use one of 
ihe computer terminals in the 
library that are hooked up to an 
online catalog called 
Information Online or 10. 

10 offers a listing of materials 
from Helmke and all of the 
other libraries in the Indiana 
University system, according to 
Yiokiic. 

Violeue said the old card cat- 
alog system has been on its 
way out for a while. "It was 
inaccurate and we felt it was 
time to move to one system or 
the other. And we needed space 
for our new computer termi- 
nals," noted Violeue. 

Jeffery Stanford, a senior at 
IPFW. had a mixed reacUon 
to the removal of the manual 
catalog. 

"If you know what you are 
looking for it's easier lo use the 
computer. But if you don't 



these things can be more difTi- 
cult," Stanford said,

Take a stand against 

special interest parties 



As the leaves depart and the 
snows of winter steadily 
:approach, the voters of the 
United States set out on their 
quadrennial journey to find a 
new chief executive. Once again 
the landscape is littered with the 
dry, empty husks of those candi- 
dates unworthy, based on the 
flitting standards of the popu- 
lace, or unwilling to undergo the 
scrutiny of the media. 

Has this mill left us the wheat 
or the chaff? Both candidates on 
the 1992 presidential ballot rep- 
resent not those with the bright- 
est or boldest initiatives. These 
caricatures of true leaders repre- 
sent a homogenized, special- 
interest indebted, fence-riding, 
name-calling betrayal of our true 
needs in a chief executive. 

Neither Bush, the incumbent, 
nor Clinton, the change -charged- 
challenger, stand a chance of 
changing our status quo. Our 
candidates are hog-tied by spe- 
cial interest groups and party 
politics in the legislative branch. 

Can Bush, who has shown a 
pro-choice bent in recent inter- 
views, stand up to the religious 
right of Pat Robertson and Jerry 
Falwell? Can Clinton implement 
a national health care initiative 
without die support and backing 
of the American Medical 
Association? Such affronts to 
established interest groups are a 
quick trip to the congressional 
gridlock dog house. 

Progress in today's party-con- 
trolled political arena can only 
be achieved by the big money 
lobbying forces of corporate and 
professional America. 

In America, in 1992, there are 
two political parties. Unfor- 
tunately both of these sit in the 
hip-pocket of special interests 
and both sit on the same side of 
the fence on many important 
issues. Through rhetoric and 
name-calling, theipork-barrel 



bureaucrats attempt to demon- 
strate the polarity of the parties. 
This polarity is as feigned as the 
violence in a professional 
wrestling match.. 

In 1992 there are a lot more 
similarities between Republicans 
and Democrats then there are 
differences. 

The influences of political 
interest groups has homogenized 
the two national parties and after 
the Perot debacle the fate of 
third party politics became near- 
ly as tenuous as the pennant 
hopes of the Chicago Cubs. 

Do you have a stand? Are you 
an environmentalist, a Pro-Lifer, 
a Pro-Choicer? Are you a capi- 
talist? A Communist? An 
Anarchist? A socialist? Your 
stance is irrelevant unless you 
act on your beliefs. With the 
absence of third parties and the 
hesitant foot-dragging of the 
national political heads you must 
focus your efforts at the local 
level. 

Change your party. 

Are you a Republican? Have 
they abandoned individuals in 
favor of quasi-theocratic rule? 
Take over the party and cast out 
those who wish to control you. 
Are you a Democrat? Have they 
sacrificed the common man on 
the altar of Presidential 
Viability? 

Take your stand now radicals 
and rationalists. Take over your 
primaries. Take over your 
precincts and your political des- 
tiny. You are the delegates to the 
conventions of 1996 and 
beyond. Steal your fate back 
from those who have captured 
your government and your soul. 

Begin today for victory tomor- 
row. Call your local party lead- 
ers and find out how you can 
participate in the process. If they 
don't answer your knock, kick 
down the door.

Mini editorials 



Prostitution should be legalized 



The government should noi 
have [he aulhoriiy to pass 
laws on sexual moraliiy. A 
person should have Ihc right 
to do whatever he or she 
wants lo do, as long as it docs 
not infringe on ihe rights or 
freedoms of anoiher. Selling 
sex docs not infringe on any- 
one else's freedom. If you 
don'l want to purchase sex, 
don't. 

The first amendment guar- 
antees thai the government 
will not pass laws restricting 



ihc individuals freedom of 
expression. And, in 1989, the 
Supreme Court ruled that 
nude dancing was a form of 
protected artistic expression. 

An individual would have 
the opportunity to choose 
whether or not he or she 
wanted lo sec nude dancers or 
engage the services of a pros- 
titute. 

Making nude dancing or 
prostitution illegal implies 
ihat sex somehow Jeopardizes 
ihe health and safely of the 



American people. 

It is true that many prosti- 
tutes are Ihe victims of vio- 
lent crimes and it is true diat 
some prosuiutes spread sexu- 
ally transmitted diseases. 

Many prostitutes are victims 
of violent crimes. Since when 
do we outlaw being a vicbm? 
The illegality of proslilulion 
pushes prostitutes into areas 
that are not patrolled by 
police. Then liie prostitutes 
are protected against arrest, 
and so are the attackers. 



Prostitutes often spread sex- 
ually transmitted diseases, so 
do sexually promiscuous per- 
sons. There are no laws 
requiring STD testing. There 
are no laws Lmiiing the num- 
ber of partners a person may 
have. 

And for die most pan, picrc 
are no laws prohibiting the 
sale of a product of a product 
it is all right to give for free. 
However, there is one such 
law, the prostituuon law. 



Language creates freedom for all 



In China one needs to know 
only 10,000 words to be con- 
sidered literate. My standard 
size dictionary has almost 
200,000 defmed words in it. 
The Chinese government is 
eliminating words. 

What would it be like with- 
out words for freedom, liber- 
ty, justice, etc.? 

When the words disappear, 
the meanings will soon fol- 
low. You could never ask 
someone if he felt the need 
for liberty. You would have 
no words with which to 
explain your question. You 
would have no way of know- 
ing that you were not alone in 



your desire. Since nobody 
would take on an army sin- 
gle-handedly, the govenuncnl 
could virtually eliminate dis- 
sent, thus gaining control 
over not only land and bodies, 
but minds. 

China is already Orwell's 
1984 . The only thing missing 
is die mental power to create 
the capability of watching 
every person. But once the 
people's minds are crippled, it 
would not be necessary. They 
would still serve the govern- 
ment's desire - total control. 

America's words are not dis- 
appearing, but many are 
being maimed. We have so 



many different definitions for 
our words thai the true me;in- 
ings are becoming unclear! ' 
Someday we won't know the 
meaning of the word free- 
dom, even though we "know" 
the word. 

Think aboui the words and 
phrases thai came with the 
hippie generation, such as 
"communing with nature". 
Even if it means nothing to 
you, you can probably use it 
in a sentence and the listener 
will pnsbably believe Ihat he 
understands you. But what 
exactly is "communing with 
nature"? Can you define it 
with any concrete word or 



phrase? Docs it mean getting 
back to our roots? What are 
our roots? Exactly - it is.^ 
probably an ameba. Haven't 
we progressed from the time 
of the neanderthals? Do we 
really want to go back - back 
to the times of the 20-ycar 
human life-span? 

Without words to explain 
ourselves, we become inse- 
cure. In insecurity, we are 
easy to control. Without 
rational control of our own 
lives, we arc headed back to 
the 20-year life-span. ^ 



Capital punishment should be abolished 



Capital punishment is a bar- 
baric practice that serves no 
purpose effectively. 

Capital punishment is not an 
effective deterrent The crime 
rates in states that don'l have 
the death penalty aren't any 
lower than the crime rales in 
stales Ihat don't have the 
death penalty. Most violent 
crimes arc spur of the 
moment, and the death penal- 
ty is the last thing on the 
killer's mind. And if you're 
cra^y enough to intentionally 
mutilate fifteen people, I 



doubt that death would be 
much of a deterrent. 

The U.S. prison system is 
suppose to rehabilitate crimi- 
nals. 1 don't see how death 
rehabilitates, aldiough it does 
prevent the criminal from 
doing it again. 

The cost ol putting someone 
to death is phenomenal. The 
prison system is a mess and 
working at an unbelievable 
cost, but reforms in the sys- 
tem could turn prisoners into 
productive citi2cns. Why not 
make a deal with General 



motors lo build cars for them 
with labor that is cheaper than 
their Mexican labor? 
(Whether or not they have 
Mexican labor, I don't know.) 
But, in diis way die prisoners 
could effectively support 
themselves and pay the 
salaries ol iheu' waraens. 

The other argument is that 
they deserve to die. I agree, 
but maybe what they deserve 
is not the question. If I sug- 
gested that they deserved to 
be tortured, Ihe country 
would say that even so, it was 



barbaric behavior and would 
not be tolerated. Yes, maybe 
what they deserve is not the 
question. 

And now, what about ihc 
executioner? Can it be men- 
tally healthy for a person to 
repeatedly kiU widiout conse- 
quences.' MOW can the law- 
makers get out of obeying the 
law? I don't think Ihc 
Govemmeni should have ihc 
power to exempt them- 
selves from the law prohibil- 
ing murder.

THE COMMUNICATOR 



Upcoming meeting 
to address disabled 
students' concerns 



By Sarah Jakacky 
Chief Reporter 

A public meeiing on Monday will 
address IPFW's accessibility to dis- 
abled studcnis, according to Randy 
Borsi, dirccior o( services for slu- 
denis with disabiliiics. 

The meeting, which will be at 7 
p.m. in Room 224 of Walb 
Memorial Union, will be a public 
discussion of IPFWs compliance 
with the Americans with DisabiliUes 
AcL 

BoRt explained that those attend- 
ing arc encouraged to offer sugges- 
tions and to discuss the new three 
year plan designed to make the 
campus more accessible. 



"ADA docs not require that we 
[ear down an enure building Just lo 
make an elevator accessible. But 
we'll do what we can," added Borsi. 

Another problem in Kctilcr Hall, 
Borsi added, is the rest rooms. He 
said they are not equipped with 
handicapped facilities. This will 
also be corrected. 

Other changes to be made include 
moving pencil sharpeners down, fix- 
ing wall protrusions in hallways. 
improving the electric doors, and 
putting up signs that mark accessible 
routes. 



"ADA does not require that we 

^ tear down an entire building 

From time to"JmTwc have had M' '» f"oke an elevator acces- 
sible. But we'll do what we 
can" 
-Randy Borst 



informal requests made, but we have 
never had a complaint," Borsi said. 

Borsi said IPFW has had no formal 
grievances filed. He said the univer- 
sity complies with ADA require- 
mcnis to make the campus accessi- 
ble to the disabled. 

Also, the ADA requires IPFW to 
provide any program [hat doesn't 
cause an administrative burden, or 
does nol fundamentally alter pro- 
grams or services where access is 
needed. 



"All entities at a university 
that benefit from stale funding 
must accommodate disabled '•^nce is required, they 

themselves lo and from class, and 



More renovations, according to 
Borsi, include installing door leven 
instead of knobs, and adding hand 
rails on sloped sidewalks. 

The total cost the three year plan 
will be in excess of a million dollars. 
Borst added. 

Besides the changes to the campus. 
IPFW is required to offer numerous 
other services to disabled students. 

"Disabled students must fulfill cer- 
tain responsibilities. Their atten- 



people." 
-Randy Borst 



The reason. Borst said, is because 
"all entities at a university that bene- 
fit from state funding must accom- 
modate disabled people and be 
accessible to them." 

In an effort lo accommodate 
disabled students, Borst said 
IPFW implemented a three year 
plan to increase accessibility 
around campus. 

Although a starting date has not 
been determined, he said changes 
will be made soon. 

Renovations include making the 
room numbers accessible to the 
blind and to those in wheelchairs. 

"Many people in wheelchairs can- 
not see the room numbers at the top 
of the door, so we're moving ihem to 
the side," sid BorsL The numbers 
will also be in braille. 

Inaccessible room numbers are the 
most pressing problem for disabled 
students, said Boni. 

Elevators pose a major problem 
because they cannot be improved 
easily, said BorsL Elevator controls 
will be moved down so people in 
wheelchairs can reach them, and 
braille will also be used. 

"Elevators, especially those in 
Kettlcr, are very small. This makes 
it difficult to get a wheelchair in 
there and to get turned around," 
Borst said. 



they must meet the codes of con- 
duct," said BorsL 

He added there are no personal 
study pnsgrams for special tutoring, 
and no attendant nursing care ser- 
vices. 

However, Borst said a variety of 
extra services are available. If a dis- 
abled student needs assisuncc the 
university must provide services in 
the areas of reading, writing, dictat- 
ing, and computer work. 

The renovations are not expected 
to be completed in the near future, 
but Borst said the university will do 
as much as they can to improve con- 
ditions for the disabled students.

SAB combats low interest 
with fresh activity ideas 



By Sarah Jakacky 
Chief Reporter 

With the new school year begin- 
ning, tiic Students Activities Board 
is attempting to recnjii new mem- 
bers, increase auendance at events. 
and improve its image, said Greg 
Callen, director of student acuviiies. 

At a recent organizational meeting 
that only four voting members 
attended, SAB attempted to discuss 
its fall Itinerary. Foremost, the 
members plan to dispel apatiiy for 
government offices, particularly stu- 
dent govemmenL 

Callen explained the recession and 
bad economy brought a negative 
image upon school activities. 

"Since December there has been at 
least a 50 percent drop in interest 
and attendance at events," said 
Callen. 

For example, Callen revealed that 
the last two dances SAB put on were 
attended by 25 people. He said pre- 
vious dances had turnouts of 
upwards of 200 - 300 smdenu . 

"Last year ti)e board did everything 
right. People just weren't coming. 
The board did a great job. especially 
with the quality and selection of pro- 
gramming, and advertising. So it 
wasn't that people didn't know 
about events," said Callen, 

Because events were failing, 
Callen added, SAB developed low 
group-esteem and "eventually it just 
became a struggle trying to 



please people." 

Now SAB is concentrating on 
boosting morale early by trying lo 
bring in fresh people with new 
perspectives. 

To introduce new studenu to SAB, 
ihey staged a "Fall KJckofT' featur- 
ing events from a stillwalkcr/juggler 
to a caricature anist, to an antique 
photographicemporium. 

"It was an effort to acclimatize 
new students and help ihcm form 
networks with each other," 
explained Callen. 

He added they arc striving to 
achieve a lum-oul of new faces and 
ideas, A large voting body, he con- 
tinued, will allow them to be more 
representative of the student body. 
To become a voting meml)cr a stu- 
dent must collect 50 signatures in 
support 

SAB will achieve more involve- 
ment, Callen predicted, by trying 
new activities as well as enhancing 
die more popular happenings from 
last year. 

Among events already approved lo 
take place this semester arc an open 
house on Wednesday, a tegular film 
series, an alternative film series, fun 
flics, mid-day diversions, and ihe^ 
lecture series. Callen said other 
activities are still in the works. 

Meanwhile. Callen said SAB will 
continue to try to bring back the fun 
and get more people involved.

Chamber music recital 



Music teachers bring classics to IPFW 



By Mary Shrock 

Features Editor 

Mozart and Beethoven will soon 

be brought together for one night of 

harmo niouscollaboniiion. 

A chamber music recital, in Neff 
recital hall, will feature the music 



"Inielleciual stimulation 
comes Jrom the expressive 
elements of the music." 
-Jane Glover 



of both Beethoven and Mozart 

T\vo associate faculty members 
from IPFW. Jane Glover and 
Cynthia Grcidcr, will join three 
other musicians on Sunday, Aug. 30 
for a recital. 

According to Glover, chamber 
music differs from otchesira music, 
in that, chamber concerts are more 
intimate with a lot less musicians. 

The concetl will be free of charge 
to those sludenLs who present a stu- 
dent services card. 

Glover said, "People don't realize 
how gratifying Just working with 
pieces is. It's an intellectual stimu- 
lation that comes from the expres- 
sive elements of the music." 

Grcidcr agreed and added, "The 
recital is a culmination of both 
being able lo work on our pieces 
and then actually being able lo pcr- 



forni them." 

As a six year member of the Fort 
Wayne Philharmonic, Greider has 
had many opportunities to show od 
her talents as a clarinetisL 

Since 1988 she has taught music 
at IPFW as well as private instuc- 
tion ouLside the school. 

Glover's role in the recital is as 
pianist But that isn't her only job. 

Glover has Uughl music funda- 
mentals to elementary education 
majors, since 1986 here at IPFW. 

In addition to college, Glover also 
taught for both elementary and 
Junior high schools in Virginia. 
Ttnas and now, Indiana. 

Glover said, "I enjoy the variety 
in my job." 

Both women have received a 
Bachelors and Masters degree. 

For Greider it was WFVJ and The 
Cleveland Institute of Music. 

Glover attended Miami of Ohio 
and Southern Methodist University 
ori&gt;aUas. 

Currently Glover works with a 
program called "Music Through the 
Piano", 3 group piano program for 
grade school aged children. 

There is both a summer ar&gt;d win- 
ter program. 

Proceeds from the Aug. 30 cham- 
ber music recital will go towards 
the support of music scholarships 
at ipnv.

Vacation trip 

IPFW student enjoys 
summer in Europe 



By Mary Shrock 
Fenlures Editor 

Spending a month backpacking 
through the Austrian Alps and sight- 
seeing Germany by train may fright- 
en those people who have never 
spent a large amount of time away 
from home, but IPFW student 
Kendra Beery said, "Don't be 
scared. Just do it!" 




Kendra Beery 

And that is exactly how she spent 
her very first summer away from 
home. 

Beery, along with two other 
American companions, spent over 
three weeks touring throughout 
Salzburg. London. Berlin and Paris, 

Through a friend. Beery was put in 
touch with a German family and 
stayed with them for a week. 

"We could undcrstanda lot of what 
ihcy said. If they spoke slow," Beery 
said. 



For die rest of her stay. Beery and 
her friends stayed in youth hostels. 

"Youth hostels are great. You can 
meet people and hang around them . 
. . or ditch them if you want to." 
Beery quipped. 

It wasn't always easy, according to 
Beery. "Sometimes it was scary not 
knowing where you were going to 
spend the night." she said. 

But Beery noted that during her 
travels she met a lot of kids like her-

self who were doing die same thing. 

What was Beery's favorite part of 
Europe? 

She was quick to answer, 
"Clodies." 

Beery enthusiastically noted, "I 
love the European fashions. I'm 
watching now "o see how much of 
the European influence is in stores 
here in the U.S," 

"Don't be scared. Just do it!" 
-Kendra Beery 

For all her travels Beery said she 
feels much more worldwise. 

"I have a respect for ihe European 
culture. 1 don't feci so small-mind- 
ed, like my country's the best." 
Beery said. 

But did Beery like Europe enough 
to do it again? 

"Absolutely," she said, 
"I'm going to go back as soon as I 
can. Probably next summer." 

For anyone who might consider 
travelling in Europe. Beery had 
these words of advice: 

"Bring a large backpack, a good 
pair of walking or hiking shoes and 
most importantly, a youth hostel 
card," Beery said. 

Beery also added she couldn't have 
made it without her copy of "Let's 
Go Europe" and her Eurorail pass. 

So. if you're considering travel 
over the holidays or next Summer, 
follow Beery's words of wisdom , , , 

"Just do it!"

SAB sponsors caricature artist 

Photographer Samuel Hoffman from ihe Fori Wayne 
Joumal-Gazcite snaps a picture of caricature artist 
Richard Morris as he sketches IPF^ student Andrew 
Hiau. 

Morris, a caricature artist from Indianapolis, thrilled 
IPFW students with his outlandish portraits when he 
was on campus last Tuesday and Wednesday. 

Morris studied art at ihtee different colleges, including 
Anderson University, and has made a career of painting 
fun at people for the last twelve years. 

Morris said that a personal business helped supple- 
ment his income, "I write and illustrate children's 
books, greeting cards, and stuff like thaC' said Morris. 

Morris's books include "Alphabet Soup with 
Anchovies" and "Irving the Duck in the Tonolse Shell

Many students needlessly miss out 
on advantages IPFW has to offer 



By Mike Wade 
Managing Editor 

Did you know ihai if you arc a siu- 
dcni at IPFW you can gci icn pcr- 
ccnl o{{ any purchase from a local 
PiZM Hul? 

Many sludcnls aitending TPFW 
miss oui on some of the advantages 
of being a student here. 

Use of the Athleiic Center is free 
10 students with a valid student ID. 
Ftff an additional tec you may bring 
a guest. 

The Athletic Center has one 
wallyball court, four rackciball 
couris, three basketball courts, a 
track, and a weight area complete 



with the Nautalis system, free 
weights. Stairmasters, and a tread 
mill. 

'The center just received a ship- 
ment of equipment last Monday, so 
all of our equipment is brand new," 
said Aamir Siddiqui, an IPFW stu- 
dent who works at the center. 

The center will provide, free of 
charge any equipment you would 
need, including rackets. The only 
item not provided is rackeiballs, and 
Uiey can be purchased from the cen- 
ter f(*S1.50, according to Siddiqui. 

Also, the center offers tours to 
any student not familiar with the 
facilities. 



You can check into the desk in the 
basement of the center and tell them 
you would like a tour. The center 
provides roving supervisers who are 
happy to show people around. 
according to Siddiqui. 

"If you wish to reserve a court for 
a speci^c time, it will cost you five 
dollars. 

"However, if you're willing to take 
your chances or wait around until 
the court is open, you may use the 
courts for free." said Siddiqui. 

If you're more into watching 
sports than pbying them, take heart; 
your student ID will get you into 
all regular IPFW sporting events

If you're not the sporting type at 
all, there are still uses for your ser- 
vices card. 

Helmke Library uses your card as 
your library card and allows you to 
chcfk out books and reserve study 
rooms. 

You can also use your card to 
make, at a discount, copies around 
campus. 

Located in the basement of Kctller 
Hall and on the first floor of the 
library are copy card machines. 

If you put your card into the 
machine as directed and insert a dol- 
lar, the dollar will be recorded on 
your card and you can make copies 
with it for eight cents each. 

The machines will also take five, 
ten, or twenty dollar bills. 

"Sometimes you will get a person- 
al copy card instead of registering 
ihc money on your card. That card 
will cost you fifty cents, but if you 
report the error without using the 
issued card, the error will be correct- 
ed and the money will be refunded." 
said Joyce Saltsman, circulation 
manager of the library. 

And just for your information, in 
the basement of Walb Memorial 
Union there is a cafeicria and a stu- 
dent rccreauon center. 

The recreation center offers pool 
tables, air hockey, video games, and 
other forms of cntertainmenu 

And don't forget the Pizza Hui dis- 
count. Some other area businesses 
also offer discounts. You can pick 
up a list of advantages of your stu- 
dent services card in the student 
government office on the second 
floor of Walb Memorial Union with- 
in the next couple weeks. 

Each semester IPFW students pay 
a student services fee. The fee enti- 
tles students to a university services 
card, which can be picked up and 
validated on the first floor of Walb 
Memorial Union. 

Students will need to present a 
paid fee statement and another form 
of identification to get their 
University services card validated.

Welcome to IPFW 
prepare to die 



BY RUSS REKLAW 
TELLER OF DOOM 

Welcome back, Sweal Hogs. 
I'm Mr. Kotter from hell. And 
I know everything that is 
going ID happen to you. Let 
me tell you right now, you can 
turn those goofy smiles upside 
down abeady. 

Virgo {Aug. 23-SepI. 22) 
About that new roommate of 
yours ... She will soon attempt 
lo club you over the head with 
an iron skillet. 

Libra (Sept. 23- Oct. 24) 
That specially made bowling 
shirt you ordered will finally 
arrive. But you will be 
shocked to find Beelzebub 
eerily embroidered on the 
front. 

Scorpio (OcL 24-Nov. 21) 
While walking through a 
crowded shopping mall, you 
will suddenly notice that 
everybody looks just like Gary 
Collins. 

Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 
21) Don't drink the milk. It's 
spoiled! 

Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19) 
During a freak Thigh' Master 
accident your legs will pop off 
just like a Barbie Doll's, 

Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 19) 
You will be walking down the 
street and from nowhere Delta 
Burke will fall from the sky, 
land on your head, and kill 
you instantly. 

Pisces (Feb. 20-March 20) 
Have 1 got a deal for you fish 
people. Send $50 and a SASE 
to, Russ Reklaw, in care of 
this paper, and 1 will reveal 
ypur grizzly fate. Here's a 
hint; it involves screaming 
ti/es and a luded up truck dri- 
ver. 

Aries (March 21-April 19) 
The next bar-b-que sandwich 



you eat at the Wal-Mart snack 
bar will be yom- last 
Taurus (April 20-May 20) 
Have you totaled a Ford 
lately? 

Gemini (May 21-June 20) 
Even 
though

eral vision. 



Cancer (June 21-July 22) 

The Surgeon General has 
determined that a healthier 
way to enjoy filter cigarettes is 
to swallow them whole, 

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22) 

Should you try bungee jump- 
ing? Sure man, what the hell 
do I care if you bust on the 
pavement like an over-ripe 
tomato? 



Russ Reklaw is a certified 
public accouniani. His views 
in no way reflect the opinions 
of Steve Shine. Even though 
Reklaw's predictions seem 
exaggerated, the fact remains- 
the bastard is always right. 



Letter from Leisure 
Throwing out the first pitch 



Greetings from Pergatory, 
I'm your honey-suckle sweet 
host Jim. I'm the guy who 
slaps together the Leisure sec- 
tion of this paper. 

And I'm the guy you'll learn 
to loathe. 

I am writing to you from a 
pink lawn chair in a 24 hour 
laundrymat called Wash 
World. The janitor, Frankie, is 
mopping all around me. 
"Careful not to slip," Frankie 
says. "The floor is wet." 

I offer him a knowing nod 
and a wink then he hits me 
across the face with the mop 
handle. Oh well. 

I'm in Wash World for two 
reasons this early early mom. 
One: because I've run out of 
underwear and I can't afford 
to buy anymore this week. 
And Two: because this is the 
primo place to write my first 
greeting of the year to the 
Leisure readers. 

Greetings! And I mean both 



of you. 

We are looking forward to a 
big year here in the world of 
Leisure. The old favorites 
have relumed and some new 
faces will be soon apearing 
here. 

We plan to add some comics 
to this page as well as some 
advice columns. 

Also, we are considering a 
special singles connection 
spot where kids can place ads 
for a small fee. 

By the way, I'm a S/W/M 
who enjoys stock car racing 
and camping. Looking for a 
sweet little lady to be my 
cowgirl. Looks are all impor- 
tant. 

Well I got to go. Frankie 's 
back and he's got a big angry 
floor stripping machine. 

Yours truly, Jim Walker

Wine, Women and Song: A Walking Tour of IPFW 



As this academic year begins, a 
new crop of fresh-faced students can 
be seen wandering through the halls 
of IPFW. These rookie Masiodons* 
can be idcntiHcd by the way ihey 
check and double-check iheir class 
schedules. Sometimes ihey can even 
be spotted scanning the handy IPFW 
campus maps in search of Neff Hall- 
or somcphce. 

As a service to ihcsc incoming 
freshmen, frcshwomen and transfer 
sujdenls, the Obtiuse Angle siaff has 
assembled "The Walking Tour of 
IPFW." This is an infoiaining step- 
by-siep tour of the important pbccs 
and things on our lovely campus. 

•Once new students have complet- 
ed this walking tour, they should be 
able 10 stride confidendy through the 
Gco-garden* past the Life Sciences 
Resource Center* and on over to the 
Fine and Performing Am Building' 
and they will know all of the way 
where the heck they arc. 

•Also, all of the words noted with 
an asterisk (•) in this introduction 
are so noted because ihey will 
appear again during "The Walking 
Tour of IPFW" as important slops. 
The words "also" and "once" are not 
noicd with an asterisk (•) for (his 
reason. "Also" is so noted because it 
is the first word in this explanatory 
paragraph concerning the use of ihe 
asterisk (*), "Once" is noted (*) 
because il is a run-on sentence. 

*For the youngslen reading diis, 
ran on sentences arc tiot popular 
with the W)30 and \V131 English 
1 instructors you may now have pro- 
fessing to you here af IPRV. They, 
the professors, would surely prefer a 
sentence like this; The ozone layer 
depleted at a rate of 32 percent dur- 
ing the last 20 years. And so on. 

Now for "The Walking Tour of 
IPFW." 
STOP ONE 

Because this is not "The Driving 
Tbur of tPFW" we wiU not deal with 
the fine roads or efficient parking 
areas on campus. But the two tnust 
begin where most students sian their 
days at school, walking from a loL I 



most enjoy parking near the river on 
the west side of campus. Sometimes 
after a long day of classes 1 will stop 
by my car and gt^b my lishing pole 
and cast out into the Su Joseph. I've 
never actually caught a hving organ- 
ism from the St. Joseph River, but I 
find peace by relaxing on ihe bank. 
And one of these days a body is 
going 10 float by. i just know it.

In 



there are Mast odon bones on 
display, 

A Mastodon is a now-extinct hairy 
elephant. It is also the mascot of this 
campus. So, as all Purdue students 
are Boilermakers, all IPFW students 
are hairy extinct elephants called 
Mastodons, Neat, 
STOP THREE 

There, may be more interesting 
stops inside Kettler, but after you 
sec the Mastodon bones, only 
nature's beauty is a suitable follow- 
up. Tliis can be found at the north- 
east side of Kettler Hall. Here we 
find the Geo-garden. The rocks have 
names. Between the rocks and die 
sidewalks arc various types of 
Indiana vegetation. lUke notes . 
STOP FOUR 

After leaving the garden by its 
north side, the student should turn to 
the lefL There is the Life Sciences 
Resource Center. On a quiet day an 
aucntive student can hear the shrieks 
of dying rodents as expcrimeniors 



find out if intense electric shocks 
kill rabt&gt;its. Or something like thaL 
STOP nVE 

Across the grass from the Life 
Sciences Resource Center to the cast 
is Neff Hall. I've only been m there 
once to have my tecdi cleaned by a 
student studying dentistry. Neff Hall 
Is the building where engineers 
build levers. And so on. 
STOP SIX 

By walking diagonally to the 
northwest comer of Neff Hall, a stu- 
dent would bump into the Physical 
Plant, home of our crack campus 
police force. While you are there, 
pay your parking ticket, I'm sure 
you've got one by now. 
STOP SEV^N 

East of the Physical Plant is the 
much beloved and colorfully named 
Classroom Medical Building, The 
highlight of CM, as we cagey IPFW 
veteran students call it, is the excit- 
ing MTV area. In this lounge stu- 
dents are often hypnotized by the 
flashing colors and dancing darlings 
on the screen. Some students have 
been seen holding their eyes half 
open, without blinking, for seven 
straight hours, 
STOP EIGHT 

Walking east from the MTV room 
in CM, students will exit to see 
Hclmke Library. Inside are many 
clever computers and other aids to 
help students find sources for 
research papers. Unfortunately, an 
estimated 67 percent of all sources 
suggested by the computers and 
other aids are not available in 
Helmke Library, Or something like 
that 
STOP NTNE 

North of the library, across the vast 
cement courtyard, is Walb Memorial 
Union. In this great building, the 
institutions of Siudenis Government,

IPFW defeats rival Western Michigan 3-0 in football kickoff...Not! 



By Joe Heersche 
Sports Editor 

Driving toward the eight suns \i\3i 
brightened the dark sky and were 
held close [o the earth by long 
wooden poles, the car's engine 
strained as tense leg muscles had the 
accelerator pedal pushed to the floor. 

The smell of freshly cut grass and 
the low murmur of anticipating peo- 
ple talking amongst ihcmselves 
rushed into the 1978 Buick as the 
door swung open and the car coast- 
ed to a stop. 

Young girls bounded by in fresh 
skirts and tight sweaters in matching 
colors, emblazoned with the team 
mascot. 

Containing the the urge to run lo 
the chain-link gate, the mind 
ovcrulcd emotions and allocated a 
brisk walk, this in an cffon to main- 
tain a composure of "cool" in front 
of the increasing mass of humanity. 

Old bed-sheets painted with green 
and yellow gently waved in the 
breeze, "Scalp the Patriots" and "A 
Mean Green Machine" informed 
one of who's Uirf was entered past 
the ticket takers. 

The night air dampened the emer- 
ald green grass, inierrbptcd periodi- 
cally by strips of shortly shaved 
patches to indicate ten yard 
increments. 



With the scats filling, the heavily 
padded soldiers began to yell and 
holler in anticipation of the end of 
wmd sprints, half-speed drills, and 
the monotony of tacking teammates 
on the barren, parched practice 
fields. 

IPFW Sports 
Spotlight 

The crescendo from the band and 
fans finally peaked and at that 
moment enough electricity was pre- 
sent to power the lights of ten stadi- 
ums like this one. 

In an instant, the place kicker's 
foot made contact with the leather 
ball and lifted it into the night air. 
This was what people had hurried to 
see this evening and what the young 
men had sacrificed the last month of 
summer vacation for. This was the 
Stan of the football season. 

But none of this drama will unfold 
on this campus. 

To all football fans, cx-quarier- 
backs, graduated bubbly high school 
cheerieaders, and former band mem- 
bers ■ welcome to IPFW! You can 
all leave your fond memories and 
dreams of stardom or popularity at

Sure, you can check on Notre

what experts predict for them this

a Coors Light and cheer for Penn 
Stale or Purdue, You can even strap 
on the old steel-iippped cleats and 
head down to the local park for 
some tackle football with your 
friends. 

Don't expect to see a footbaU play- 
er with a hairy elephant on his hel- 
met, or buxom blondes in short blue 
skirts yelling "Mash "em 
Mastodons," or to read about a last 
second field goal victory over rival 



Western Michigan in The 
Communicator. 

Why not, you ask? According to 
Amie Ball, IPITV athletic director. 
the reason is money. 

"Starting up a program is an unbe- 
lievable task. The cost is tremen- 
dous," Ball said. 

At first this point seems reasonable 
enough. It is expensive to suit a 
football team. But what about 
Franklin, Wabash, Rose-Hulman, 
the University of Indianapolis, 
Western Michigan, and other types 
of colleges like these across the 
United States?

TTicse schools are all able to field 
teams. They have less students, cer- 
tainly less revenue and lack the 
backing of two major universities 
like Indiana and Purdue. 

A larger stumbling block here is a 
lack of motivation for starting a 
footbaU program here. 

The interest in a football program 
has not been expressed, so why 
mess with sutus quo? The right peo- 
ple have never been behind such and 
effort so rPFW's football program is 
what it is today, non-existent. 

Many people complain of IPFW 
students' nonchalant attitude regard- 



ing c.\iracurricular events. And peo- 
ple complain that ihcy do not feel 
like this is a "real" university. 

Maybe a football program would 
help. 

But now the proud soldiers jog ' 
onto the field among cheers from the , 
fans decorating the steel skeleton 
stadium, and the band strikes up 
the school song as the cheerleaders 
kick in unison. 

Just then we. the IPFW students, 
can case back in our Lay-Z-Boys, 
pop open our Coors Lights, and 
watch from the quiet safety of our ' 
living rooms. -i

Baseball try outs open 

Changes slated for team 



By Joe Heersche 
Sporls Editor 

The 1993 IPFW men's baseball 
icam will hold iryouis Tuesday. 
Scpl, 1, between 4-6 p.m. at ihe 
IPFW baseball field. 

Head Coach Mail Ktnzer 
planned a Ihrcc day tryoul wiih a 
scrimmage. "1 expect to sec 70 
guys out there. My team is noi 
scl. I'm looking for baseball play- 
ers." KJnzcr said. 

Participants should bring their 
gloves and spikes and be prepared 
10 throw and hit, "Realistically 
I'm looking to fill around five 
spots from these tryouls." Kinzcr 
said. 

Kinzer believes although ihcy 
had good players last year, some 
of the best were sitting in the 
classroom and not playing base- 
ball. 

Kinzer's philosophy on a suc- 
cessful baseball program consists 
of a nucleus of good pitchers. 
■"Pitching wins ball games, but 
you've got to be secure behind the 
plate, and strong up the middle, 
too." 

With this philosophy Kinzer has 
already started to recruit players 
and has major changes in mind for 
the Mastodons. 

"There is no reason a school 
with 14.000 students can't put the 
best players on the field and com- 
pcic," Kinzcr said. 

The first step for Kin/cr was 
recruiting. Kinzer has recruited 
I&gt;avc Kolpien out of Wayne High 
School. Kolpien is a right-handed 
pitcher who Kinzer thinks can 
. have an immediate impact. Matt 
Lcininger from Snider was an AJl- 
Slalc shortstop last season. 

One of ihc most underrated play- 
ers in last season's high school 



competition was Rob Millcdgc 
from Snider, Kinzer believes 
Milledge may have the arm 
strength and speed to progress 
beyond collegiate baseball. 

Kinzer also recruited players 
from other colleges and landed 
Gary Cooper from Huntington 
College. Mike Garcia from 
Valparaiso and Wade Stuckey who 
plays first base will be relied on to 
lead the team as a senior role 
model. 

The pitching staff will be 
enhanced with freshmen Travis 
Bradford and John Kricker. 
Kinzer expects Bradford to be a 
closer this year and Krider to pilch 
seven innings with his combina- 
tion of three different strong pitch- 
es. 

Some of the strong returning 
players from last season's team 
will include Chad Ketzler, Sam 
Nolan, and Ron Dial. 

Ketzler is one of [he strongest 
hitlers on the team, according lo 
Kinzer. 

Kinzer also expressed a need for 
left-handed pitching. 

Once tryouts are complete, 
Kinzer expects to practice 
throughout the Fall, including 
practice games against local 
teams. 

A spring training trip to Florida 
is in the works to prepare for ihe 
start of the season. 

Kinzer would like to change the 
look of the Mastodons and lo 
inject some excitement into the 
program. The team's new moiio, 
"Mastodon Baseball, the Greatest 
Show on Dirt." and new uniforms 
purchased through fund-raising 
projects, will complement the new 
enihusiasm Kinzer brings to the 
program. 



Former Detroit Tigers player 
to coach IPFW baseball team 



By Joe Heersche 
Sports Editor 

What do Bo Jackson and Deion 
Sanders have in common with the 
new IPFW baseball coach. Matt 
Kinzcr? Jackson and Sanders have 
also been two-spon aihleies. 

Kinzer. who played professional 
baseball with the St. Louis Cardinals 
and Detroit Tigers, also competed 
with the Detroit Lions of the 
National Football League. 

As a right-handed pitcher, Kinzer 
was drafted m the second round by 
Sl Louis in 1984. During the 1987 
season he got his chance to become 
a single-season two-sport athlete by 
punting for the Lions. 

"/ am going to put forth hard 
work and effort and will expect 
the same from my players." 
-Man Kinzer 



After being traded lo the Tigers in 
1989, Kinzer suffered an injury 
which pu[ a premature end to his 
career as a two-sport athlete, 

Kinzer began preparing for a dual- 
sport career as a high school student 
at Norwell. 

As a punter her earned Alt-State 
honors for his junior and senior sea- 

Kinzer also garnished All-State 

honors in his senior season as a 
pitcher. 

In 64 innings he struck out 122 bat- 
ters, walked nine; and allowed just 
seven hits. Kinzer netted a 7-1 
record that year with two no hitlers. 

After graduating from Norwell, 
Purdue University at Wesl Lafayette 
provided a fall scholarship. 

This was not ihe only choice 
Kinzer had. The Cleveland Indians 
drafted him in the sixth round out of 



high school. 

'A high 80s low 90s fastball was 
what drew the Indians to scout 
Kinzcr. 

Kinzer balked at heading directly 
to professional baseball and opted to 
go 10 Purdue for four years. 

At Purdue, Kinzer continued to 
play both football and basebiall. "I 
knew baseball wouldn't last forever. 
and I am a prime example of this," 
Kinzer explained as the reason for 
choosing college. 

As far back as Kinzcr can remem- 
ber he had wanted lo play profes- 
sional sports and attributes his ath- 
letic prowess lo his father. 

In the early 1950's his father 
signed with the Cardinals for literal- 
ly "a pair of shoes and two train 
tickets," siad Kinzcr. 

Last season for IPFW, Kinzxr was 
an assistant coach, and this will be 
his first season as head coach. 
Although the Mastodons only had a 
few wins last season. Kinzer is 
optimistic. 

Kinzer attributes his optimism to 
his expertise in recruiting and his 
high expeclalions of each player and 
the team as a whole. 

"I am going to put forth hard work 
and effort and will expect the same 
from my players," said Kinzcr. 

"I expect respect from them (the 
players). I don't expect it because of 
where I have been, but who J am," 
said Kinzer,
