®arking up the wrong tree 
Policy could change fee procedures 



by Jertmy Exenharger 
trfilor 

Whili: Uie frigid weather condilions have 
made the trip lu class seem like an endless 
mission, many siudetils may feel ihai mak- 
ing it lo campus is only 
half ihe battle. U is 
oficn [he search for a 
parlung place Uiat is 
the real lime-consum- 
ing ia.sk 

Recently, the 

k^^ administration has pro- 
\....^^| posed an idea on 
jk ^^H changing ihc procedure 
p mBI of how students are 

charged for parking 
fees. Their idea would 
consist of setting a 
straight fee per credit 
hour. 

According lo Walter Branson, vice chan- 
cellor of financiiil affairs, the new policy 
would require students lo pay around S2 for 




each credit-hour they are taking. He said he 
feels die policy would be more "equitable" 
to students. 

"We haven't fmaliaed the fee yet," said 
Branson, 

Currendy, all students pay a straight fee of 
S28 for parking privdeges for an academic 
semester. According to Branson, die admin- 
istration plans on raising die fee S6 next 
year, for a total of S34 

Parking fees go towards the service of the 
parking garages and maintenance of the 
parking lots 

The increase in fees is due to the new 
parking garage scheduled to begin consiruc- 
Lon in the fall, The garage will be located on 
the soudi side of campus. Branson says it 
should be fmished by April of 1998, 

Students have dilTerenl opinions when it 
comes to the possible change in the parking 
fee policy. 

"I know a lot of pan-lime studenLs who 
spend more iimc than me on campus." said 
sophomore Diana Sir Louis, a full-time stu- 
dent with double major m public affairs and 
philosophy, "It's like they're punishing 



pa 1 1 



there 



"I think they need 
to stick to a straight 
fee. It just seems too 
difllcull to maintain" 
said senior John 
Maloley, a part-time 
student with a major 
in organi;; ational 
leadership. "Maybe a 
pro-rate syslem would 
work." 

Branson finds 
many other henefils 
within the recom- 
mended program such 
as doing away with 
student parking per- 
miLs. 

"The average stu- 
dent takes around 
nine credit hours." 
said Branson. "[ think 
students would be 



happy with the proposal " 

Campus police seem to 
think it may cut down on 
the number of parking tick- 
ets ihey give each day 

"I think it would be more 
convenient tor students 
who have to continually 
switch their passes from 
one car to another," said 
Lauren Denhanog, chief of 
police and safety 
Many students forget lo display their 
permits, which is a contmuid reason why 



they are Lckeied. 

Branson believes that the new policy 
would be more inviting lo community resi- 
dents. 

"One of our major disadvanuges is to 
welcome visitors on campus." said Branson. 
"It can often be confusing for diem " 

The administration has discussed the 
new proposal with members of IPSGA. 
They hope lo infonn the entire student body 
after information has been gathered 

"It's not a policy yet," s;iid Branson. "We 
are jusi interested in seeing what everyone's 
notions would be" 



Engineers: Opportunity knocks 



On the east side of the campus 
lies a $10 million budding estab- 
lished in 1993 On any given day

by Su.san Spindler 
Staff Writer 

Looking for somediing to do ihis 
weekend that will expand your mind 
widiout deflating your wallet? The 
United Native American Students 
aiNAS) of IPFW have a solution. 

flNAS is excited about pre-scni- 
ing speaker Tom Biron, who will be 
giving a lecture Saturday on "Native 
Amencan Family Values " 

Biron is a traditional Ojibwa 
from Garden City, Canada, and lec- 
tures throughout die Michigan area. 
He is the program director of Native 
American Studies at Lansing 
Community College. Biron also 
works as administrator and faculty 
for die Native Amencan Leadership 
Program at Lansing Community 
College. 

Bu'on has had a lot of experi- 
ence working with the Native 
American community He managed 
and developed health and human 
ser\'ice programs for the Sault Ste. 
Mane Chippewa unbe. Biron acted 



as the primary adviser to Ihe 
Lansing Indian Center Mayor's 
Youth Leadership initiative. He 
gained financial support for the pro- 
grams held throughout the year and 
offered his support to 
the community

Blueprint" which deals with cross 
cultural community leadership. He 
helped connect two United Way

Syrette, who is the Spintual Leader

pus. 

According lo Eva Howe, UNAS 
president, it's a good opporiunity. 

"People can receive education 



from teal Native American people 
who practice their culture," said 
Howe," Hither than from someone 
who hasn't got a clue, when they 
read Native American culture in 
books. 

All speakers which are brought 
by Uiis organization are screened by - 
Native American academics,"

o( Fori Wayne The eveni is being 
called -A Blucgrass Valentine " 

"The music is mixture of folk, 
blues and country." says Terry

"Blucgrass is fun It is fool stomp- 
ing and full of rhythm." 

Like all Loft events, Blucgrass 
Valeniines will be videotaped

Although a low lunioui, four

molivaied, Doran is looking beyond 
the sUess and ego problems The 
director confesses thai he is getting

"I'm nuts I've been involved in

The Loft has been in existence 
for three years With its brick exleri- 
or walls, plaster interior walls, hard- 
wood ^oo^^ and open space, it is 
hard to argue with 

Doran took over The Loft in 
June and spent last year rearranging 
the Loft's space. Now he said he is 
working on raising money and 
receiving granis, many of which are 
just a phone call away 

Future events The Lofi antici-

National Condom Day 





Happy 

Valentine's 

Day! 



hy JaiiKS Corson 
StafT Writer 

As students focus on Pnday. 
many have visions of swccLs. flow- 
ers and stuffed animals. Valentine's 
Day approaches soon. love making 
carries through the air like a virus 
Ironically, it is also National 
Condom Day 

The American Social Health 
Association (ASHA) sponsors the 
third annual National Condom Day. 
a day focusing on educating 
Americans about sexually transmit- 
ted diseases and prevention of 
unwanted pregnancies. 

According to the Institute of 
Medicine, five of the top 10 most 
freijuently rcpoHed infectious dis- 
eases in the U.S. are sexually trans- 
milted. One-fourth of these report- 
ed cases occur in teenagers. In many 
ca.ses. sexually transmitted diseases 
(STD) contain few, if any, symp- 



toms that an STD is present By 
using a condom, you eliminate 
transmission of an infection you 
may not realize that you have 

In 1994. the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention studied Ihe 
effects of couples in which one part- 
ner was HIV positive. By using con- 
doms consistently and correctly. 98 
percent of the couples avoided 
transmission of the vims lo their 
partner Granted, the only absolutely 
effcclivc way of stopping the traas- 
mission is abstinence, but if are sex- 
ually active, the use of condom sig- 
nificantly reduces the potential risk 
of t}ccaming infected with an STD, 

This year AS HA offers two free 
brochures on condom use through a 
toll-free number. Either brochure 
can be ordered by calling 1-800- 
972-8500, Free information about 
STD's is also available through the 
National STD hotline at 1-800-227- 
8922.

Education is priority 

Tougher standards needed 



It n thi: most important thing we 
have. We arc all concerned 
with ji and we all need it. It is 
our education and President Clinton 
has made it a lop priority for his sec- 
ond lerm in office 

With the growing concern peo- 
ple have a'garding ihc cost of col- 
lege and the questionable quality 
ofTcred at local schools. CUnion has 
proposed a S51 bil- 
lion increase (an ~ 
annual 20 percent 
inacase) in educa- 
tion spending. 

The money 
would be aimed in 
several directions. 

ll would go 
loward increasing 
access lo ai least 
iwo years of col- 
lege, increasing 
Internet access, 
increasing Pell 
Grants and offer- 
ing a lax deduction 
ofuploSlO.OOOa 
year for education 
expenses 

These much ^ 

needed change\ 
would better give students of every 
social status the same opportunity lo 
gain information and knowledge 

In addition lo these changes, 
Clinton has proposed setting nation- 
al standards for schools This would 
entail stales adopting voluntary 
national tests in reading and math. 
This would also allow 
Americans to compare scores 
with those of other countries. 

America has lagged behind 
other countries in the progression of 
academics long enough. It is time 
we caught up. 



Critics who believe the opera- 
tion of public schools is a local and 
state matter say this proves that the 
era of big government is not over, 
that this is just another way lo 
incorporate education into the 
federal government. 

Sure, education is a safe pohti- 
cal choice, but nonetheless its cur- 
rent sutus warrants change. We 
need tougher 

""* standards in our 

schools. Too 
many people get 
through school

is the key to 
decent employ- 
ment. 

Children 
today will need 
more academic 
and computer 
knowledge than 
we do in today \ 
job market, 

We neeO 

tougher standards 
in education t&gt;ecausc many jobs 
require advanced technological 
skills. It is no longer enough to have 
a high school diploma and some 
experience in typing. Now most 
places require college degrees 
and extensive experience 
with computers. 

All levels of government 
need to help enforce these pro- 
posals in education. Tougher 
standards for education are 
needed if we want to succeed in 
a world that increasingly holds 
us to higher standards 



Proving SAT wrong 

Every kid's fantasy 



We have all dreamt of ii — 
proving the SAT wrong. 
Well 17-year-old Colin 
Rizzio did just that. He found one 
math question on October's test 
was wrong 

We thought since the Iheme of 
higher standards in education was in 
the air. it seems only proper that the 
Educational Tesimg Service (ETS). 
the board which devises the SAT, be 
held to the same standards. 

This IS big The error has affect- 
ed 350,000 students who took the 
October test. ETS has said that only 
45,000 students will sec their score 
increase. The tests will be rcscored 
to reflect the correction which may 
raise students' scores by 30 points. 
That is a lot when you are border- 
line to getting accepted into your 
school of choice. 

What if the question was not 
caught? Think back to your SAT 
score. Would it have made a differ- 
ence if your score was 30 points 
higher? Of counie it would 

Members of ETS have said they 



doubt the increase in score will 
affect college admissions decisions. 
Yeah, right. What else can they say? 
We know that 30 points can make or 
break a college admission. 

This IS noi the fu^sl time some- 
one found an enor on the lest. The 
last was m 1982, and although these 
discoveries are rare, these are only 
the ones that were found Think of 
bow many go undetected. 

Ironically, milhons of students 
work hard to do well in high schtwl 
and rely heavily on their SAT score 
— which determines what school 
they will go to. what kind of educa- 
tion they will receive, which will 
determine what kind of job they 
obtain — only to find out that the 
test Itself has wrong answers 

If we are now to beheld to high- 
er standards, then we need to bold 
ETS to the same, incidents like 
these are unacceptable We are sure 
that ETS would like to remind us 
that we all make mistakes Wouldn't 
it be nice if college admissions wea' 
as understanding?

Circumstantial men and their ways 




I have 
worked ai -The 
Communicator 
for almost two 
years, but none 
of my writing 
has ever 
appeared before 
now. Actually, 
this is my first 
attempt at a col- 
umn. You see. I've been hiding 
myself in the darkroom all this time. 
In an attempt to further diversify this 
paper, I have agreed lo comply with 
the wishes of the other editors and 
fmally add some of my thoughts 
Here goes. 

1 can't say that I'm a man-hater, 
some of my best fnends are men. 
you'll even find me dating one on an 
occasion, but sometimes I find the 
same types of men gravitating 
towards me and it's not a good thing. 
Lei me phrase it this way. 
there are certain characteristics 
that just naturally put some men 
into categories. 

Maybe it's me. Maybe I only 
attract certain types of men, but I 
think many women are familiar with 



the kinds of guys I'm about 
to describe. 

The Eternal Guy Friend- This 
is the guy who you would wiLingly 
spend all your time with. You watch 
TV together, you share your deepest 
sccTCtsYou tcU him about your woes 
with other guys and you listen to his 
girl problems. He's sensitive He 
remembers your birthday You feel 
utterly and completely comfortable 
with him. In fact, you do everything 
together- urn. almost everything. 

Sure he's the perfect guy, but 
you could never have a relationship 
because you "know him too well." 
It doesn't make sense, but a common 
occurrence nonetheless. You tell him 
"If only 1 could find someone like 
you" and no matter how often you 
allude to a "more than friends" rela- 
tionship, nothing ever happens. 

Someday, years later, you'll be 
silting on the couch together. He's 
still a bachelor and you're a spinster. 
He'll look over at you and say, 
"Why didn't we ever hook up?" and 
you will roll your eyes and continue 
to knit 

The Bar Guy- Watch out for 
this one! Iliis guy will admire you 



iTom afar. Many limes he can be 
detected out of the comer of your 
eye. Pretty soon, he'll slither 
over to you and ask to dance He 
seems harmless. 

-Maybe it's your favorite song 
Maybe your just tired of dancing 
alone. Maybe you just wanted to 
get back at your girlfriend for 
ditching you while she danced 
with some guy. 

Anyway, you say "yes" (and 
alcohol wilt frequently influence this 
answer). It's almost always the same 
from there. You're dancing normal- 
ly. He's obeying the laws of "per- 
sonal space," maybe you're even 
having a friendly conversation. 

Suddenly, as if you'd said, 
"Please gel as close to me as possi- 
ble even though I don't know you. 
Then 1 would prefer it if you'd either 
say something inappropriate or at 
least attempt to touch me Thanks " 
And they say romance is dead. 

Where's the suspense? "Hey 
Sparky, get down off my leg and 
take a few steps back. Mating sea- 
son is over. See ya!" A good, old- 
fashioned slap to the face would 
also \uffice 



The On Again, Off Again Guy- 

Ah yes. this is the guy who thinks 
you're great when he can't find any- 
one else 

This is not a very healthy situa- 
tion for the ol' self-esteem. Sure you 
haven't seen him for months, but 
one day he'll pop up from "land of 
the ex's" and he'll want to go out 
with you (again). 

This isn't always a bad scenario 
as long as you expect just as much 
out of it as he does, but if the guy 
consistently "finds someone else " or 
"doesn't think things are working 
out" (or ihe third time, then you' re in 
for a rough ride! 

It probably isn't wise for me to 
have this column in the day before 
Valentine's Day. but these sto- 
nes are all too true and deserve 
to be told. 

Sure, my chances of actually 
having a Valentine won't be 
increased, but I have to work tomor- 
row night anyway. Isn't that every 
dateless girls' excuse? Meanwhile, 
the list keeps growing, so maybe 
there will be a second inslalhnent of 
"Sara's unfortunate circumstances 
with men."

did not show up to work," 



What do you think makes the 
world and everyday life bearable,' 

If we didn't have music to relax 
you. or the chance to see a movie to 
let you live in a little fantasy for a lit-

spirit that exists in sports, you 
would go insane from the sheer 
monotony of everyday life. 

If it wasn't for enienainers, all 
you would have to look forward to

Why do these people get paid so 
much money? Because it takes

Expressing campus gripes 




("here is never 
an explanation 
for some things 
m life Some 
say there is an 
answer to 
e verything , 
maybe 1 just 
can't find them 
A few weeks 
ago wtui evening 
classes were canceled due lo the 
weather, I couldn't help bui wonder 
why night classes were canceled 
Thursday, but not the day classes It 
seems to me that at night, more 
adults attend classes, compared 
to teenagers. 

So, IS the campus saying they 
rather have young, less experienced 
dnvcrs nsking their life lo get here? 
Whde most adults have had years of 
bad weather driving experience. 
Does this mean adults' lives are 
more important than those of us 
who do not have a spouse or kids? 
I also wonder why anyone 
would pay SI for a 16-ouncc bottle 
of Pepsi, when the store sells a two- 



liter lor 94 cent.s. I do not know 
why more students don't eat at the 
cafeteria for lunch The food is 
actually good, and you gel a hot 
cooked meal, instead of some pre- 
fabricated tfOii:n value meal. 

While I'm on a roll (pardon the 
pun) I would like to ask the finan- 
cial aid department a few things as 
well. 

Why IS It that every Ume you go 
there lo check on your file, they tell 
you something different* One per- 
son tells you they have all your 
information in the computer, and 
your aid will be lo you next week 
Of course by the next week, some- 
one else tells you there Ls a problem 
and papers will be sent to you in 
seven weeks. 

In addition to all of this, bow 
come it seems that all of the pro- 
fes.sors decide to change book edi- 
tions at the same time, and you have 
to buy new text books for every 
class, and then the only book store 
on campus doesn't have enough to 
supply the entire class roster. 

My biggest questions are politi- 



cal ones, being a political science 
major 

I've nouced some things that I 
think are better left in the private 
sphere. I feel that in political sci- 
ence courses teachers should not 
voice their affiliation to a political 
party 

Many students have their own 
opinions about government olTi- 
cials. and certain political parties. 
When a professor constantly "dogs" 
a student's political beliefs, they 
feel if they voice their ideas, their 
grade will reflect their opposing 
opinion I just wish teachers would 
give us the knowledge and let us 
form our own opinions. 

Enough of my questions, even 
though I have plenty more, I really 
would like to answer some of these 
before I come up with other gripes. 

If you can help me in these 
questions you know where I'm aL 
If you are my political science 
teacher, maybe you could be sup- 
portive of my political views too

Maybe everyone is righl. Maybe 
I love spotu too much. But lately, 
for some reason, people have fell the 
need lo remind me how spons are 
just polniless and frivolous games. 

I'm not usually enircmcly arro- 
gani, bul in this case I'm prcily sure 
that I'm right and everyone who has 
confronted mc on this subject is 
wrong 

Though contrary lo popular 



1 h c y could 
swing at was 
darkness. 
A decade ago I used to live out 
my dreams by pretending I was 
Keiih Smart in the championship 
game of the NCAA loumameni, [ 
would count down die time, and 
before the imaginary buzzer sound- 
ed in my head. I would launch a 
fade-away jump shot from the left 
side of tbe basehnc. 

Of course I missed that jumper 
70 percent of the time, which is why 



I'm writing about il and not wrapped 
up in the current season. But I 
remember what ii felt like when I 
made it. 

Those childhood memories will 
slay with me forever, and this is why 
guys love sports. It's not because of 
the brutal action or the testosterone 
level. It's because we remember 
wbai il was like playing catch with 
dad in the backyard, and we remem- 
ber what it was like to be the hero — 
if only in our minds. 

ITietB comes a time in each liide 
boy's life when he can read his 
future like a road map. No pressure 
lo graduate in the lop 10 percent of 
his class or explaining why he hasn't 
declared a major. If he wants to be a 
firefighter when he grows up, all he 
would have to do is simply follow 
the right paih 

At some time or another, his 
hopes, dreams and goals will lead to 
one destination — lo become a pro- 
fcs.sional athlete; not for the money 
or endorsement deals, bui simply 
because he loved the game 

How many lilUe -leaguers have 



you heard say, "When 1 grow up. 1 
want lo be just like Mike — so I can 
have a guaranteed 10-year, S60 mil- 
hon contiaci with with a signing 
bonus and built-in performance 
clauses." 

Little Johnny doesn't say thai 
because he doesn't care He jusi 
hopes that someday he might be able 
to see himself on a bubble-gum card. 

Basically we all want lo be the 
hero. What could be greater than 
being doused with Gaioradc, hoisted 
onto a teammate's shoulder and 
paraded aroutid as a champion 

If a hide kid had a basketball 
pole in his driveway, he knew thai 
he was a hero everyday. 

So please, don't tell us that 
sports ai;p Just a game, because every 
lime dial you do, thai road map thai 
was once so clear becomes more of 
what we know it really is — a sim- 
ple hope and dream. 

Thai dream is all we have left to 
remind us of what we used to be — 
that little kid with innocence in our 
eye and our face on a

Porter, however, does find ii 
hard to separate his personal rela-

"I write for The Journal Gazette

Even though he has never 
actively been involved on an athlet-

has shown interest in the program

required GPA is 3,0, Scott said 
many pasi recipients have had much 
higher GPAs. 

Along with the scholarship 
applicalion. which can be obtained 
m depanmeni offices mvolved in Ihe 
award's criteria, students must sub- 
mil a university franscripl and three 
letters of reference. The letters of 
reference should be written by 
IPFW instructors and mailed direct- 
ly lo the Withers Scholarship 
trustees through the IPFW Office of 
Financial Aid Students should also 
include a bnef statement pertainmg 
to iheir post -g tad uation plans. 

Withers Scholarship awards are 
given to all applicants meeting the 
qualifications without consideration 
to race, religion, sck, age or resi- 
dence Applicants must, however, be 
US citizens 

Previous Withers Scholars are 
ehgible for a second award, and 
Scoll said, it is not uncommon lo see 
students who won the scholarship in 
their junior year win it agam as 
seniors. 

"Surprisingly, we haven't had 
many applicants thus far," Scoll 
said. "The deadline is March 15 and 
winners will be notified sometime in 
mid-April. 

'Finding Withers Scholars is a 
iwo-slep process," Scott said. "The 
board of trustees reviews applica- 
tions and determines what students 
are eligible. The applicants are then 



interviewed. Within a week afler 
interviews, we coniacl the wmnmg 
studenls by mail and telephone 

"In the past, about three-fourths 
of Ihe Withers Scholars have tended 
to be women — not because we seek 
them out, but because they've tend- 
ed 10 have the higher GPAs," Scoit 
said. Past winners names are listed 
on plaques outside ihe Financial Aid 
Office in Keiller 

"Occasionally studcnLs will be 
covered by other scholarships thai 
cover their tuition and. in those 
cases, we try to work with the olher 
scholarship to work out a bencfici^ 
situation for the siudcnt." Scoll said, 
"The Withers Scholarship is specifi- 
cally for tuilion and tees, but will 
not cover books. In that case, we iry 
work with the other scholarships so 
they will cover books. 

"If is student is already covered 
by scholarships, we wiU name them 
as an honorary Withers Scholar, 



enablmg us to award the money to 
another student." Scoll said. 

Over 100 Withers Scholarships 
have been awarded to IPFW stu- 
dents in the past 12 year^ Previous 
Withers Scholars have gone on in 
pursue careers in teacbiug, law and 
many other occupations 

"The Withers Scholarship is 
interesied in getting sludents 
through school as soon as possible 
by providing them with money to 
cover the bulk of their college 
expenses," Scoti said. "That way 
students have to work less and can 
afford 10 spend more time studying " 

Interested students should 
obtain Withers Scholarship applica- 
tions from the selected IPFW 
departmenLs. Any quesuons about 
the Withers Scholarship should be 
directed to Scoll, a Withers tnistee, 
at (219) 481-6686. 



Psi Chi cleans up semester 



Tfie Communicator is

This semester Psi CTii has Ihe 
answer to your problems. 

As many do their spring clean- 
ing in upcoming weeks, they are 
overwhelmed by the amounts of 
clothing piling up in their closets 
and drawers. This is why Psi Chi is 
having a clothing drive from now 
until April 30 

Psi Chi. Ihe national honor soci- 
ety in psychology, is conducting a 
national seiwix project tilled Adopt 
a Shelter for 1997 

In response lo this project, the 
IPFW chapter of Psi Chi has adopt- 
ed Ihe Indiana Youth Advocate 
Program, a private, non-profit orga- 
nization as benefactor for the prt&gt; 
ject 

The Indiana Youth Advocate 
Program which has been in Fon 
Wayne (or four years, works with 
most of all the children living in 
local foster homes. The program 
pairs an aduh with every foster child 
in northeast Indiana for five to 10 
hours a week. 

The child seLs out with a list of 
goals, whether they be behavioral 
goals like increased socialization 
and anger management or academic 
goals like passing a class The adult 
Ihen is responsible for helping the 
child 10 achieve these goals and 
finding the resources to allow ihe 
child to succeed 

If a child is inieresicd in gomg 
to college and having a career in sci- 
ence, the "big buddy" can take the 
child to a local campus for a tour 
and then take ihem to 
Science Central to get 



"hands on" experience. 

"By having this program it gives 
the children a big-buddy to lean on 
for help," says

clothes donat- 
ed during the 
clothing drive 
will benefit 
children who 
come into the 
foster care sys- 
tem wiih liitle or nothing. Those 
already in established homes can 
also benefit, because of the small 
amount of money available from Ihe 
state to spend on personal iiems. 

Psi Chi is asking students and 
faculty to bring in good used cloth- 
ing or shoes, and new items such as 
socks and underwear for children 
ages newborn to 1 8 years. A barrel is 
in place in front of the information 
desk in KcitlerHall. 

Coming later this semester will 



be a candy sale sponsored by Psi 
Chi. The proceeds from the sales 
will also go to the Indiana Youth 
Advocate Program. The 
profit will be spent on 
Christmas gifLs for local 
foster kids, in hopes of 
making the holiday sea- 
son a little brighter. 

For those majonng mf^ 
social work, human 
vices has the Indiana 
Youth Advocate Program. 
The program offers 
opportunities for expe- 
rience and employ-

continually in high demand in Fort 

Wayne. 

"Foster families don't need to be 
rich." said Berko, "One fam- 
ily in Fort Wayne has five 
teenage foster kids; plus the 
foster mom is battling can- 
cer, and they still manage." 
"1 am honored that Psi Chi 
is so generous lo choose us 
as their benefacior." said 
Susan Freeman, director of 
The Indiana Youth Advocate 
Program, "The money and 
clothing will go directly to 
the children."
