INDIANA - PURDUE COMMUNICATOR 



INDIANA-PURDUE UNIVERSITY, FORT WAYNE, INDIANA 



Abromowitz to go to England 
in Purdue Exchange Program 



"I'm delighted. I'm really looking 
forward to it." 

Jay S. Abromowitz made these 
about his up- 



travels to England 
September of 1974. He will teach 
Mechanical Engineering at Trent 
Poly Technic in Nottingham, England 
(just outside of Sherwood Forest), 
while the professor he replaces at 
Trent will come to Fort Wayne to fill 
Dr Abromowitz's position. 

Abromowitz and his family will 
live in England for an academic year, 
and his English replacement will 
reside in Fort Wayne with his family 
for the same time. The two professors 
teach essentially the same courses, 
therefore they don't foresee any 
difficulties in filling each other's 

Abromowitz intends to "hop in his 
(English Professor's) shoes, and live 
like he does." He noted, "We are 
planning to live like the typical 
English family. It will be a great 
experience for the 14) kids, as well as 
for my wife and me. Our kids will 
attent English schools and play with 
the English kids on the block." 

This will be Abromowitz's first 
trip to Europe, and he regards it not 
only as a great opportunity for him, 
but for his kids as well. It will give 
them the opportunity to see some of 
the world early in life. He hopes they 
will also have some time to travel 
around the European continent. He 
indicated they might arrange for the 
rental of a Vjlkswagon bus to suit 
their transportation needs. 

"We are plan- 
ning to live like the 
typical English 
family. It will be a 
great experience 
for the kids, as well 
as for my wife and 
me." 

Dr. Abromowitz is also very 
satisfied with the program in the 
means that it could prove very 
beneficial to the engineering division 
at Indiana-Purdue. He acknowledged 
that the English engineering pro- 
grams were ahead of Fort Wayne's in 
some areas, so the presence of a 
professor that has worked in the 
English program should be a great 
value to the IU-PU engineering 
program. 

Dr. Abromowitz added, "We are 
getting some new equipment that they 
already have in England. My replace- 



i when I return to Fort 



Wayne the following year, I will be 
able to present the operational 
procedures to the students." 

Abromowitz's feelings about be- 
ing the experimental source were, "I 
would have been glad to be the first, 
second or third person to go. The only 
i me is the 



exchanging with only has 1 

and I have four, so I don't know if his 

house will be big enough for us or 

Dr. Abromowitz will attempt to 
line up more exchanges while he is 
situated in England. There have been 
about thirty other Poly Institutes in 
England that have already expressed 
interest in participating in the 
Exchange Program. 

The Purdue Exchange Program 
is in its preliminary stages. It is 
intended to become a well developed 
program that will help to develop 
communication between all relevant 
academic and administrative levels 
of Indiana-Purdue and other institu- 



The program will consist of a 
three-phase structure which will take 
several years to become fully 
developed. Phase 1, which will begin 
in September of 1974, will involve the 
faculty. Phase 2 will consist of 
bilateral fureign personnel exchange 



Likewise, a geology professor from 
the other institution will be exchanged 
for a geology professor from IU-PU. 

The opportunity will be open not 
only to faculty members with national 
or international reputations. All 
respected, contributing members of 
the academic community will be 
eligible to participate in this pro- 
gram. 

The basic criterion for selection is 
the content specialty of the faculty 
members to be involved (since they 
will replace each other). Subject 
matter competency, teaching skill, 
and language fluency will be the only 
requisites as far as faculty qualifica- 

The exchanged faculty will be 
required to complete a host-country 
study course prior to leaving their 
home country. The exchange assign- 
ment will also be preceded at the host 
institution by a four-week orientation 
period devoted to orienting the faculty 
member and family to the host 
country and institution, establishing a 
home planning and preparing cours- 
es, developing collegial relationships, 
and establishing contact with the 

The source feels that through this 
program the visitor will find that 
Indiana-Purdue represents a more 
typically American campus than does 
a university town or a larger 
iiK'tropnlikin area. The opportunities 



This campus, as regarded by the 
faculty and administration involved 
in the planning of the exchange 
program, strives to provide the 



ity of the universities' chief adminis- 
trative officers. The academic dean 
will be responsible for the matters of 
faculty welfare and integration into 
the life of the institution and the 



After next fall's faculty exchang- 
are concluded the involved faculty 
d institutional officers will be able 
3 evaluate the exchange programs. 



found desirable by the evaluators. 

Indiana-Purdue representatives 
hope that the program will be 



truly educated and socially valuable 
individual. 

The exchange program is impcr 



the world of which they 
increasingly important part. The 
campus community should benefit 
significantly from meaningful expo- 
sures to and the interactions with 
diverse cultures not presently repre- 
sented locally. Long-term relation- 
ships with institutions exchanging 
faculty should result from the 
involvement of all levels of the 
academic community within partici- 
pating institutions. 

The host institution will be 
responsible for accommodating the 
visiting faculty members at a 
reasonable standard of living. The 
faculty member will receive his 
regular stipend for the year from his 
employing university. The host insti- 
tution will be responsible for provid- 
ing for additional money needed to 
raise the faculty member's standard 
of living to the desired level. 

When the foreign faculty member 
arrives, he will be assisted by a 
colleague from his own discipline, A 
host family from the community will 
be responsible for the faculty member 
while he is at the institution. The 
guest faculty member will be given 
the opportunity to associate formally 
and informally with the city govern- 
ment, the local industrial and 
business community, the public 
school system, and various social 
organizations.

will continue the faculty exchange on 
a periodic basis. 

A source indicated that after 
several faculty exchanges, the insti- 
tutions may decide to pursue phases 2 
and 3. After details of the intial 
procedure have become routine, the 
second and third phases should be 
able to join without much difficulty 

The Purdue Exchange Program 
is an institutional program for the 
exchange of higher education person- 
nel, but it has several characteristics 
that make it different from most 
foreign exchanges.

Democrats throughout the city 
and county are receiving a letter from 
the Allen County Democratic Central 
Committee-not an unusual occur- 



But this year, this particular 
letter is different It is not soliciting 
funds or searching for volunteers to 



This letter, sent by the Central 
Committees Candidate Recruitment 
Committee, is seeking out qualified 
Democrats who may have an interest 
in running for public office. 

Committee Chairman Merle Fel- 
ger said the letter addresses itself 
primarily to those Democrats who 




»ing after those 
Democrats who often say to them- 
selves, 'If I were in this or that office, 
I know what I would do.' In all 
likelihood many of these people would 
make excellent candidates, but they 
never seem to be contacted to 
translate that urge to run into positive 
action," Felger said. 

That is the job of Felger's 
Candidate Recruitment Committee. 
Letters have gone out to hundreds of 
Democrats seeking to spark what 
might otherwise be a dormant 
interest in running for a particular 

If the recipient of the letter 
decides against running, he or she is 
asked to pass the letter on to a friend 
who would be qualified and interest-

"We certainly are not desperate 
for candidates," Felger pointed out. 
"We simply want to make every 



s overlooked in the candidate

Mayor Ivan A. Lebamoff, elected 
it Saturday as chairman of the 



s role in preserving the basic 
function of a political organization. 

"The very term "participatory 
democracy' inherently implies that 
everyone is given the opportunity to 
play a role in shaping the outcome of 
the elections. During the four years 
that I served as Democratic Chair- 
man, it was strict party policy that 
the Allen County Democratic Party 
be the open party in this county." 

"Now that policy is even more 
deeply entrenched. We are anxious to 
open our party to all interested 
persons. A public office is still a 
public trust and we are seeking the 
broadest possible base of honest, 
sincere and dedicated Democrats to 
present to the people in May and in 
November," Mayor Lebamoff said.

Pornography bill 



passes Senate 

INDIANAPOLIS (ICPA) - The 
state of Indiana is coming closer to 

writing a new pornography law as the 



the House. 

Senate members voted 49-0 for 
passage of the measure which Sen. W. 
Wayne Townsend, D-Hartford City, 
labeled a "motherhood bill," so called 
because of the nature of the bill and of 
the native constitutional appeal to the 
pornography i: 



At the mental ward he is 
committed to the care of Big Nurse, 
played by Carol Howell, This char- 
acter is a full-breasted, sliff-gaited 
tyrant who rules over charges with 
chilling authority. 

Her ward is a citadel of discipline. 
Strongarm orderlies, played by 
Stephen Shoemaker and Tim Heine, 
Nurse's game is. Appalled by the 
timidity of his fellow patients, he 
begins his one man campaign to 
render her powerless. First in fun, 
then in dire earnestness, he sets out to 
create havoc in her well-run ward to 
make the gray halls ring with 
laughter, and anger and life. 

McMurphy promotes gambling in 
the ward and smuggles in wine and 

According to Daniel E. Cashman, 
director, the play is not really about 
mental illness but about oppressive 

systems and responsibility.

visual matter. The bill d.vides 
pornography into two sections: per- 
formances, meaning any play, motion 
picture, dance or exhibition; and

books, magazines, newspapers or any 
printed or written material. 

Kirby to address 
honors convocation 

J. Randolph Kirby, an assistant 
professor of education, was the 
featured speaker at a Huntington 
College honors convocation today at 

Kirby, who specializes in the 
history of education, titled his speech 
"Quo Vadis: A Space Odyssey." 
The speech compares the frontiers 
facing people during the Renaissance 
period with the intellectual frontiers 
that the students are facing today. He 
stressed the point that the students 
should devote their lives to man's 
humanity. 



mental hospital is but a reflection of 
the same kind of craziness we see in 
the outside world. This ribald, 
boisterous not-for-children play is 
often hilarious, compelling and deep- 
ly moving." 

The novel, One Flew Over the 
Cockoo's Nest was first adapted into 
play form by Dale Wasserman, who is 
best known for Man or LaMancha. 
Cashman has acquired a different 
version of the script that is more 
recent and improved. This version, by 
Lee Sankowich, enjoyed a long run in 
New York at the Mercer Theater. 

Kesey, the author of the novel, is 
the subject of the best-selling non- 
fiction book titled The Electric 
Kool-Aid Acid Test by Tim Wolfe. 

The PIT staff members for this 
play are: Lyn Stangland, costumes; 
Daniel Kelley, lighting and setting; 
Sylvia Bechtelheimer, assistant to the 
director; and Jill Armstrong, stage 
manager. 

Other cast members not previous- 
ly mentioned are: Dave Miller, Cynth- 
ia Horvath, Don Apple, Dan Butler, 
Jan Swank, Alexander T. Demetroff. 
Doug Opdycke, Gerry Snyder, Marcia 
Kress, Jill Armstrong Ferry, Steve 
Snapp, Craig Beaverson, and Margie 
Howard. 

Tickets may be reserved by

Sclerosis Marathon, held by Circle K in cooperation with the Students' 
Government, it would be most appropriate to include in Webster's 
definition "the student body at Indiana-Purdue, Fort Wayne." 

The Marathon was held in the students" own building on campus, that 
4M; million dollar structure north of the Library that the majority of 
students utilize for eating purposes, and little else. 

Hundreds of hours of preliminary effort by members of Circle K and 
Students' Government were spent preparing for this event. Success 
hinged on how generously the student body would participate in fighting 
the dreaded Multiple Sclerosis. 

Needless to say, the turnout was not only poor, but shameful. The 
student body of this campus demonstrated by their complete lack of 
participation jusl how little they believe in themselves, their university, 
and most importantly, others less fortunate than themselves. 

When historians sit down and attempt to understand how a thing like 
Watergate could happen in America, they should stop here at our 
campus, and analyze each of us.. ..then they could understand real 
"apathy." 



Veterans services 



Urban universities tend to have a high number of so-called "adult" 
students, such as housewives, working professionals, and ex-servicemen. 
Indiana-Purdue is no exception. , 

IU-PU has a large ex-GI population, numbering in the vicinity of one 
thousand. Many of these students are in school via the GI bill, which 
financially aids veterans who want to go to college. 

Veterans have unique problems when they return to school. One 
major problem is dealing with the federal Veterans' Administration, a 
typical federal bureaucracy. They also have special academic problems 
that require a special kind of counseling. 

IU-PU veterans are lucky, however. They have two places to turn for 
this special help One is Xi Gamma Iota (XGI) Fraternity; the other is 
the IU-PU Office of Veterans' Affairs.^ 

XGI Fraternity offers veterans a social fellowship that the older men 
cannot easily find in those Greek and other organizations that are 
oriented toward the younger students. In addition, the fraternity setting 
enables the men to share common problems and experiences. 

The Office of Veterans' Affairs is a unit of Student Services. The 
office assists veterans in dealing with the VA and other governmental 
agencies that are big on red tape. It also offers the counseling and 
tutoring services that are sorely needed. 

All veterans should avail themselves of these two services. They can 
make a difficult college experience much more pleasant and rewarding. 



IU-PU crime 



It is painfully obvious in American society that crime is increasing at 
an increasing rate. Every survey tends to substantiate that claim. 

Indiana-Purdue is experiencing its own crime wave. The last couple 
of weeks have produced two significant arrests on campus. 

One was drug related. Three non-students were apprehended for 
possession of illegal drugs last Friday night The alleged offenders, who 
claimed to be here for a dance, were found to possess both heroin and 
marijuana. Incidentally, one of the suspects was rumored to be a 
member of a large Fort Wayne heroin ring. 

The other arrest involved a student and book theft. The student was 
stealing books from the music department lounge area in Neff Hall and 
then selling them to the campus bookstore. The student has been 
convicted in Superior Court. 

There have also been numerous cases of parking lot breakins, stereo 
tape thefts, and purse snatchings. 

The significance of these incidents is that the crimes are becoming 
more and more serious. In the case of theft, the value of the stolen articles 
is greater now than it has been before. 

Much of this crime can be attributed to carelessness on the parts of 
the owners. Drivers leave their stereo tapes and other valuables in the 
open, almost as if they are tempting would be thieves. Purses are often 
seen unattended in hallways, lounge areas, and restrooms. 

IU-PU students are pretty easy marks for someone who is looking for 
a lucrative area of operations. Let us hope that we don't attract too many 
such operators. 

10' per hour for mud 

It was interesting to note that parking meters were installed in the 
North B lot near the Student Union. It's about time that we start charging 
visitors ten cents an hour for the privilege of walking through the mud 
downslope to the Union. 

Maybe the Business Office ought to construct a shoe shine stand on 
the Union's loading dock. We ought to be able to get 25 cents more out of 
the sorry souls who choose to park up there.

Deceiver conditions for distortion 



By Jerry Miller 

What is The Magic Mirror? 

Actually we have all caught the 
reflections at some time in our lives. 
We have beheld many fleeting 
images. But why do we not see more 
clearly? I believe a deceiver has set 
up his hall of mirrors all around us. 
He's given us much to consider, but 
nothing to rely upon. You and I have 
been conditioned to accept distortion. 

1 would like to share what I view; 
however, my fiew can be just as 
distorted as anyone else's. If I share 
my vision with you, and you share 
yours with me, we may discover we 
have much in common. Yet even then 
we'll not be seeing very clearly. 

For that reason I must do my best 
to reflect the Light which only The 
Magic Mirror can reveal. Undistorted 
images are sometimes frightening, 
sometimes enraging. They are also 
transforming. Men and women have 
been known to change before the 
penetrating rays. 

Cryptic? Mystic? 

No, not really All which is hidden 
shall be revealed! Nothing will be left 
uncovered! 

What is The Magic Mirror? 

To answer, I must quote the 
Source Himself. .."But we all, with 
open face beholding as in a glass the 
glory of the Lord, are changed into the 
same image from glory to glory, even 
as by the Spirit of the Lord." (II 
Corinlhians 3:18) 

Our identity changes. Our percep- 
tion of reality deepens. Truth grows 
within and without. The person who 
knows Christ is a new creation. And, 
in the language of the scripture, 
"Behold! All things are become 



Regardless of your individual 
perspective, you must realize one 
thing. Your pleasure or displeasure 



I want to give you something. I'm 
ot your enemy .Yet, I must admit — 
le cross is a difficult place to begin. 
;ut, since we're all beginners, there's 
o need to run ahead of ourselves. 

"For the preaching of the cross is 
i them that perish foolishness; but 



destroy the wisdom of the wise, and 
will bring to nothing the understand- 
ing of the prudent." (I Corinthians 
1:18-19) 

Sound all too familiar? 

Let me ask you a favor. Tell me . . 
. how do you feel right now toward 
yourself? Toward me? Toward Jesus 
Christ? Please write me a letter in 
care of the Communicator. Let's be 
open and honest with each other. 



(f you're doing the best you can, 
then please don't apologize for 
anything you are, or were, or will be. 
We want you to be all you can be, and 
we both believe in you. 



Do you care to make Christ 
known to IU-Purdue? If so, United 
Christian Action (UCA) is for you! 
UCA is a new student organization 
which meets every Wednesday at 
12:30 p.m. in Room 114 of the Student 
Union. UCA's purpose? To expose the 
academic community to the reality of 
Jesus Christ. 

There is a time and a season for 
everything. The time for United 



Christian Action is now! If you're free 
at 12:30 on Wednesday, why don't you 
look into UCA? If you're not free then, 
but would like to help out in some 
way, drop me a note at the 
Communicator office I'll see that 
you're filled in on what's happening. 

Whatever became of Fort 
Wayne's "paper mache monument to 
stupidity"? See the next appearance 
of The Magic Mirror for an explana- 
tion. In the meantime, let's be 
listening to Him.

FOOTNOTES: A CONGRESSIONAL REPORT 



Issues of '74 Congress previewed 



The 93rd Congress reconvened 
last week after a month of what was 
for me a busy recess. It has often 
occurred to me that Congressional 
recesses are just as important as the 
time we spend here in Washington in 
session for it gives us an opportunity 
to visit at length with the people we 
represent and investigate with care 
the programs we as a Congress 
authorize and fund. 

I would like to take this space to 
preview for you some of the key topics 
that I see facing the 1974 session of 
Congress. 



Foremost in the press at least is 
the issue of the impeachment of the 
President. The House Judiciary 
Committee has been charged with 
looking into this most serious matter 
upon the recommendations of both 
Democrats and Republicans. It is my 
hope and expectation that the 
Committee will proceed with the 
utmost caution in this matter and take 
steps only on the firmest of grounds. 

Energy will continue to be a 
major recipient of Congressional 
attention. The failure of the House 
and Senate to agree on an Act giving 
the President sweeping powers over 
energy prior to adjournment in 
December was due to incredibly 



Killers act first, 
think later 



complicated questions such as appro- 
priate profit levels for oil companies. 
Continued negotiations on this meas- 
ure will continue. In addition, I look 
for a major Congressional study on 
how the energy crisis crept up on us so 
suddenly - why we weren't better 
prepared. 

Congress and the President will 
continue to lock horns, it appears, 
over priorities in federal spending. 
Sitting as a member of the House 
Appropriations Committee, the first 
Congressional Committee to consider 
the President's budget, I plan to very 
carefully apply my priorities as a 
legislator to Mr. Nixon's proposals 
before voting for the expenditure of 
federal funds. 

Elementary and secondary edu- 
cation will be an imnortant subject in 
this year as the Elementary and 
Secondary Education Act of 1965 
comes up for renewal. This means 
that we will be considering changes in 
our school-aid programs to educa- 



tionally deprived, handicapped and 
adult students as well as a number of 
special programs. 

President Nixon has indicated a 
desire for a new system of health 
insurance in the Nation and I am 
hopeful that his leadership in this 
area will prove to be the catalyst for 
broad reforms in our health care 
1 delivery systems in this country^ 
Costs have become too high and care 
too difficult to obtain for many, many 
American citizens and this reprehen- 
sible situation must change. 

The Senate will be confronting a 
major piece of House-passed legisla- 



dealing with foreign nations on trade 
matters and strengthening safe- 
guards for American workers and 
employers adversely affected by 
foreign competition. 

Likewise, the House will have tp 
come to grips with a Senate-passed 
measure reforming private pensions.

whatsoever he saith." Mark 11:23 




"I have had quite a few patients 
who have killed people and never 
have gotten over it. They have their 
own death penalty which stays with 
them for life. 

"Right now I have a man in 
therapy who is 70 years old. He 
murdered a man when he was 20, and 
it's been preying on his mind ever 
since, so much in fact that he is 
almost psychotic now. He hasn't had a 
happy day in 50 years," she said. 

Dr. McCurdy, whose career has 
been dotted with numerous positions 
at state prisons and mental hospitals, 
is now a therapist with the La Canada 
Counseling Center in suburban Los 
Angeles. 

"If society really wants a 
deterrent it should be life in prison

Liked 'non-hysterical' editorial 



To the Editor: 

I was rather pleased to see your 
non-hysterical editorial on collective 
bargaining on January 28. It should 
please you to know that many of us 
(although unfortunately not all) who 
are promoting collective bargaining 
in the University are concerned not 
just with pay increases, but also for 
conditions to improve working condi- 
tions and faculty-administration rela- 
tionships; not just with benefits for 
faculty, but also for conditions which 
we believe will lead to a better 
educational process, the main benefi- 
ciaries of which will be students. 

Again, some (but not all) of us 
consider the primary objective of 
better educational institutions to be 
students. We are concerned with 
part-time faculty, and with non-aca- 
demic employees of the University. 



We

concerned with the relation- 
n the University and the

all these groups, students, non-aca- 
demic employees and the community 
will work with us and on their own to 
promote the goals of a better 
University; one which will be 
governed democratically by the 
people whose lives it touches.

Fight song by 
DeFronzo 

To the Editor: 

The "Fight on Mastodon" song in 
the January 24, 1974 issue of the paper 
was erroneously attributed to Jane 
Prochnow Nusbaumer, Brenda 
Rouse, Sue Cook and Kathy Blee. 

In reality James Vito DeFronzo 
wrote this song. He is a PhD 
candidate in sociology at Bloomington 
and a former lecturer in sociology at 
Indiana-Purdue extension, Fort 
Wayne. 

Thank you, 

SUE COOK 

Editor's note: Please extend our 
apologies to Dr .-almost DeFronzo. We 
are glad to discover that even though 
he has left our midst, he really hasn't. 

Says Red Cross 
needs some funds 

To the Editor: 

Last year the Red Cross spent 
their money on -many disasters such 
as floods, hurricanes, and fires in the 
United States and around the world. 

This year the Red Cross may 
,havejnany more disasters to handle 
along with their everyday duties such 
as collecting blood and helping people 

For the Red Cross to be able to do 
their things, I suggest that we might 
ask that the government pay the 
treasury of the Red Cross and let 
them take the inventory of our fuels 
and report to the President or the 
chapter.

THE NAMELESS ONES 

You borrow her notes for that class you missed. You 
discuss job prospects with him for ten minutes after a class. 
You share a knowing look, even a smirk when the professor 
recites a very old joke. You ask him if he'd like to play a 
game of pool over at the Union. You sweep aside some dead 
coffee containers at the library and ask them to join you and 
the talk begins while the study languishes. The faces are the 
faces of friends, but the names are among the missing. 

Ten years from now you'll remember those faces and 
smile and nod in passing as you do today. Your brain will 
provide "Econ class" or "Poli Sci." or you will be 



about empathy being the important human factor. But why 
not name it? Learn those names-first and last. Just Chuck 
won't do. And last names alone can fail to serve you in a 
telephone book or student directory.

By VINCE L0CHB1HLEB 

There comes a time every year when 
nothing interesting is happening in the 
world of sports Professional and college 
basketball teams are just playing out their 
seasons before the crucial playoffs. It's too 
late for football, too early for baseball, and 
who cares about hockey 9 The only thing of 
interest around Indiana-Purdue is intra- 
mural basketball. 

Here is how I rate the teams in each

THE BIG TEN RACE 

The Big Ten race this year has been 

somewhat interesting with four teams still 
in the running for the championship 
Purdue and Michigan are tied Tor the lead 
at 6-1 while Indiana is 5-1 and Michigan 
State 5-2. 

Michigan State has been the surprising 
team in the leagu*.- as ilu-y knocked Purdue 
from the unbeaten ranks with a two-point 
victory last Saturday The Spartans also 
came within a basket of upsetting 
third-ranked Notre Dame on Monday. 

The Indiana Hoosiers have been 
playing just good enough basketball to win 
(with the exception of their game with 
Michigan). The Hoosiers' 85-50 romp over 
Iowa Saturday ended a string of two and 
four point narrow victories by the Hoosiers 
over their opposition.
