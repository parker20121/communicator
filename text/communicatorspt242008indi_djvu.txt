Televised governors debat heats up 

Economic crises leaves little room for other issues 



By DAN JEHL 

Wrilef 

The crime scene was 
the Star Plaza in Merrill- 
viile, the venue of choice 
for celebs performing in 
Northeast Indiana near 
Chicago. On Scpl. 16. it 
was Indiana's three can- 
didates for state gover- 
nor. Tliey were Republi- 
can incumbcnl Governor 
Milch Daniels, Demo- 
crallc challenger )jll Long 
Thompson, and Liber- 
tarian challenger Andy 
Horning. 

The one-hour tele- 
vised debate, before 
about i,000 people, 
featured nine questions 
from Indiana residents 
submitted online lo the 
Indiana Debate Commis- 
sion, the sponsor of the 
thrcc-schcdulcd debates, 
with Ihe final questions 
selected by a committee 
of the stale-wide press. 

■|\vo words capture it 
all: "the economy." The 
economy was the issue 
of the hour, becoming 
increasingly so the top 
issue since gas prices 
passed $4 dollars a gallon 



less than a year ago. So 
what's the problem? 

This is not the norm. 
Debates typically reflect 
the issues of the day and 
multiple issues they usu- 
ally are. And the diversi- 
ty of Indiana's publics are 
heard, all of them. 

In this debate, the 
economy dominated, 
trumped, and squeezed 
out other takers. This 
was due in part to the 
recent news of Lehman 

"lypically, there are 
other matters such as 

initiatives regarding 

minorities, education 

proposals,..." 

Brothers going bankrupt, 
Merrill Lynch being sold, 
and the Wall Street Jour- 
nal calling it all a "crisis." 
Typically, there are other 
matters such as initia- 
tives regarding minori- 
ties, education propos- 
als, health care ideas, 
and more. 

The Merrillville de- 
bate did have some in- 
teresting comments on 



non- 

but one would miss 
them if someone's cell 
went off nearby. Gover- 
nor Mitch Daniels called 
Gary's economic prob- 
lems partly due to "cor- 
ruption," and Jill Long 
Thompson agreed. The 
time zone was raised and 
discussed in economic 
terms. 

Libertarian candidate 
AndyHorningmentioned 
he raised a goat. The 
moderator cautioned 
him about bringing up 
goals amidst "many Cub 
fans" in the audience. 
Horning mentioned go- 
ing back to the basics 
or the constitution six 
limes to approach all 
issues. And Jill Long 
Thompson said today's 
answers are in "growing 
the economy " ten times. 
It alt came back full circle 
to the economy. 

And this may very 
well continue all the way 
to election day, when the 
people choose the state's 
CEO on Nov 4. Andy 
Downs, IPFW Associ- 
ate Professor of Politi- 
cal Science, said to The 



Co mmunica ton " Th e 
economy is the number 
one. two and three is- 
sue that will be raised for 
therest of the campaign. 
When other issues are 
discussed, there is a very 
good chance they will be 
discussed in an econom- 
ic context." 

Other issuesand other 
ideas are getting booted. 
Reform of the much-crit- 
icized state's "academic 
progress" legislation for 
pre-college students, 
new or rehabilitative 
housing initiatives per- 
haps by an Indiana Hous- 
ing Authority, changing 
the time zone, expand- 
ing the health care cover- 
age Healthy Indiana Plan 
(HIP) foradults. minority 
education initiatives, im- 
migration reform, return 
to school incentive pro- 
grams for high school 
drop outs, lowering the 
drinking age, approv- 
ing another casino, and 
many other issues typi- 
cally on the plate during 
a race for governor are 
falling on the floor or 
talked about as crumbs 
that aren't edible now.

IPFW student murderer 

faces 60 years 



By DAN JEHL 



On September 19, 
Tina Morris entered a 
courtroom at the Allen 
County Courthouse in 
downtown Fort Wayne. 
Morris entered Ihe Allen 
Clounty Superior Court in 
chains and jailhouse out- 
fit. She shielded her face 
from the TV cameras. 

"Senseless!" That's 
how Steven Godfrey, the 
Allen County Assistant 
Prosecutor, described it 
after the sentencing. 

Possibly avoiding the 
death penalty and salvag- 



ing a chance of freedotn 
some day. the 38-year- 
old Morris and prosecu- 
tor Godfrey agreed to a 
plea agreement. On Sep- 
tember 19, Allen County 
Superior Court Judge 
Frances C. Gull accepted 
il, sentencing Morris lo 
GO years in the custody of 
the Indiana Department 
of Corrections.. 

Martinez's parents 
from New Mexico were in 
coun. After the sentenc- 
ing, Geraldine Maninez, 
Liette's mother, said: "We 
don't hate her but we are 
not willing to forgive her 
either."

The President Speaks 

Voicing your IPFW thoughts

On Monday Septem- 
ber 29th IPFW students, 
staff, and faculty ivill 
have a rare opportu- 
nity that should not be 
missed. From 10am un- 
til 2pm a dunk tank will 
be located in front of the 
Science Building. People 
ivill have the chance to 
dunk various Professors, 
Vice Chancellors, and 
even Chancellor Wartell. 
For those who might be 
urd'amiliar v^th the dunk 
tank concept basically 
someone tfuows a ball at 
asmall target which if hit 
makes someone fall into 
a large thing of water. 

The "Dunk-A-Doc" 
event is hosted by Geo- 
Sciencc students earn- 
ing money for a weekend 
visit to Mammoth Caves. 
The cost to participate is 
51 for one ball or 55 for 
sb(; and of course dona- 
tions will be accepted. 

1 will definitely be 



in attendance. I enjoy 
watching people fall 
into water over and over. 
However I will be the first 
to admit that my throw- 
ing abilities are about 
t%vo levels below medio- 
cre so I will most likely 
just be watching other 
people succeed at it. 

People with a lot of 
stress can use this oppor- 
tunity to potentially feel a 
little bit better about life. 
And dunking a profes- 
sor can be a great way to 
show disapproval of the 
college establishment. 
Plus people should feel 
nice inside because the 
money is going to a good 
cause. 

1 highly encourage 
everyone to drop by the 
event, if nothing else to 
be entertained for a few 
hours. If the event is can- 
celled due to weather 
it will be moved back 
to Wednesday October 
lllh. 

On a final, unrelated 
note the deadline for 
registering to vote in the 
general election is ap- 
proaching very shortly. I 
will have much more on 
this subject next week.

More to Johnny than his apple seeds|op-Ed 



By KELLY MCLENDON 

Writer 



The life of Johnny Ap- 
pleseed was a complex 
tale of tuberculosis, plant- 
ing apple trees and liv- 
ing off the land. For many 
people, the familiarity of 
this frontier icon for most 
people extends only to the 
abridged, partially false 
story taught in elementary 
school. His legend teaches 
us that we can thank Ap- 
pleseed for his hard work 
planting "the first" apple 
trees. In fact, he did not 



plant the first apple trees, 
at all. In actuality, all he 
did was widely scatter 
apple seeds across a few 
states. 

While Appleseed is 
revered in Fori Wayne 
because his name is at- 
tached to a festival where 
they serve delicious ap- 
ple dumplings and most 
items drizzled in luscious 
caramel, the real story is 
a little more complicated 
and can't be so easily su- 
garcoated. 

Appleseed, whose 
real name was John 
Chapman, traveled from 




his home state of Massa- 
chusetts to Ohio in 1797, 
with a brilliant business 
plan in mind. He would 
travel to regions that 
hadn't yet been settled, 
plant apple seeds and 
wait for them to grow 
into trees. When the set- 
Uers showed up, the trees 
would offer a source of 
food and he would then 
sell them for a profit. This 
venture made him a very 
rich man, although he 
never seemed to spend 
his wealth on himself. 

Rumors speculate Ap- 
pleseed wasn't just grow- 
ing the trees for food and 
because they'd really 
spruce up the dull, bar- 
ren scenery in a couple 
years. On the contrary, 
he was perhaps planting 
them for other people to 
make alcoholic apple ci- 
der 

A confusing note to 
make about the apples 
being used for the pur- 
pose of alcoholic cider 
goes back to the fact that 
Appleseed may not have 
even been an ardent 
drinker. 

"One source claimed 
Johnny never touched 
liquor because of his reli- 
gious convictions. A sec- 
ond claimed he enjoyed 
"a dram of spirits" in the 
winter." said Hank Finck- 
en, an actor from India- 
napolis who thoroughly 
researched the subject 
in order Co dress up like 
Appleseed for a perfor- 
mance. 

Whatever his rea- 
son was for haphazardly 
planting trees, he may 
have mistakenly contrib- 
uted to the destruction of 
the natural surroundings 
of the lands he planted 



It's not common 
knowledge that he plant- 
ed more than apple trees. 
Very few know the tin- 
pot hat wearing man is 
also responsible for dis- 
persing weeds, such as 
fennel. He planted the 
weeds as frivolously as 
he planted his trees. In 
the book, "The Botany of 
Desire", author Michael 
Pollan says, "Even today, 
Ohioans call it [fennel] 
"Johnnyweed." In ad- 
dition, Appleseed also 
planted many herbs. 

Appleseed's pursuit 
of dispersion is one that 
is not too far away from 
the acts of terrorism the 
United Slates could ex- 
perience today He was 
able to walk state to state 
and plant, without any 
reguladons or any offi- 
cials telling him any dif- 
ferent. 

'Apart from his al- 
most fanatical devotion 
to apples planted from 
seed, his business was 
distinguished by its por- 
tability: his willingness 
to pack up and move his 
apple tree operation to 
keep pace with the ever- 
shifting frontier Chap- 
man had a sixth sense for 
exacdy where the next 
wave of development 
was about to break." Pol- 
lan said. 

Appleseed's "sixth 
sense" for finding the 
next big parcel of land 
had disastrous results 
for the landscape. If 
given the opportunity, 
he would've used all the 
land he could, until ev- 
ery seed was planted. 
Given the great accessi- 
bdit&gt;' of moving state to 
state, the opportunity to 
plant more monstrous 
plants could have easily 



existed. 

Besides taking the 
lands for all they were 
worth, Appleseed's time 
also may have been oc- 
cupied with other ques- 
tionable activities. Alle- 
gations exist that he was 
engaged to a 10 year old 
girl at one time, promis- 
ing to marry her when 
she was older. The story 
says years passed and 



when he came to inquire 
about finally marrying 
her, she was engaged to 
someone else. 

Overall, there are 
many contradicting sto- 
ries surrounding the life 
of Appleseed. As Fincken 
said, "It is nearly impos- 
sible to capture the true 
character of John Chap-

The Top 10 

Signs This Isn't a Dream 

1 .You pUiched your arm as hard as you can but, histead 
of wakmg up, you just squealed like a little girl. Wuss. 

2. You're frozen, unable to move, but you're just crip- 
pled by self-doubt. 

3. You're lost in the woods, but this time you remember 
how you got there: alcohol. 

4. You're in a hot tub with two beautiful women, but 
they're not movie stars. Unless you count the video of 
your family reunion. 

5. Your grandmother appears with a message hom be- 
yond the grave, but you just have to talce her back to 
the rest home. 

6. You're in class, taking a test, and you're not in your 
underwear. You only do that if it will help your grade. 

7. The "red-eyed monster" in your closet is just the re- 
cord light on a video camera. 

8. That voice in the dark is just your imagination. Your 
evil, demon-possessed imagination. 

9. In real life, you can't fly. Well, you can, but only for a 
few seconds, in a do^^mward direction, once. So enjoy 
it! 

10. That "homicidal maniac" chasing you is really just 
your dad. Still, better keep running. 



Purchasing crabs through a website? 



By Victoria Toups 



People often say re- 
venge is a dish best 
served cold. But when il 
comes (o getting back at 
an ex, revenge could be a 
dish best served alive. 

Sure, things staned 
out great. Everyone saw 
the happy couple all 
over campus, holding 
hands as they skipped to 
class together, widioul a 
care in the world. A few 
months have gone by, 
and she can't handle one 
more day of him play- 
ing video games with the 
"boys." and he can't take 
one more day of her con- 
stant nagging, bickering 
and PMS. 

After the relationship 
goes downhiU and the 
happily- ever-aftercouple 
isn't so happy an^inore. 



revenge is oh so sweet. 

Girls will hack into 
boys' Facebook accounts 
and change their favor- 
ite movie to "The Baby- 
sitter's Club." And boys 
will go to Bogie's lo try 
to bring home as many 
late-night specials they 
can find. 

But for people who 
aren't messing around 
and want to take revenge 
to a whole new level, 
consider Revenge Crabs, 
com. 

Revenge Crabs is a 
Web site offering pack- 
ages of "crabs" to infest 
anyone you deem de- 
serving. 

Each package comes 
with the colony of crabs, 
a detailed instruction 
sheet on the best way to 
pass the crabs on and 
bottle of anti-crab sham- 
poo in case of accidental 



"self-crabbilying." 

The creators of re- 
vengccrabs.com prefer 
to remain anonymous, 
but on the Web site they 
describe themselves as a 
"collection of profession- 
al guys who all attend a 
well-known university in 
the northeast." 

One of the creators 
was seeing a girl that 
kept him itching for less, 
not more, because she 
infected him with crabs. 

TXvo of fiis brothers 
found themselves "in 
the same final throes of 
prickly screaming chig- 
ger nibbling," according 
to the Web site. 

The boys vowed two 
things that day: "bros 
before hoes," and if they 
had to have the crabs, 
then all them 'biznalch- 
es" should have a couple 
of waves of crabs, too.

Curio, more than one man 



By Abigail Kopen 



Every day new up and 
coming arlisis of all 
genres try lo make it in an 
industry [liai is - to say the 
least - exiremL-ly selective. 
In order to go anywhere in 
the entertatnmeni busi- 
ness one must have some 
kind of talent. ..at least rn 
most cases, Curio, how- 
ever, is a man of many 
talents. 

Al 28 years old. Nathan 
"Curio" King-Farmer is a 
handsome and charming 
performer from New Jer- 
sey who means business. 
He can dance, sing, rap, 
and ivrile as well as pro- 
duce. After starting Cu- 
rio Productions in 2004, 
Nathan opened his own 
home based studio and 
has since made his own 




music video Jo his song 
"Beatin" Cheaiin " Dnd is in 
the process of coming out 
with three new records 
consisting of R&amp;B, rap. 
and poetry put to music. 
When asked what kind of 
ideas and principles he 
incorporates in his mu- 
sic. Curio said "Just every- 
day life type stutT. 1 think 
many artists now have 
gotten away from the real 
thing. Some of my stuff is 
about love and some of it 
is just me, but at least it's 
real." 

So why has such a smart 
and talented artist not 
been offered a record 
deal? Well apparently 
he has but turned them 
down. He states, "The re- 
cord business is so finicky. 
They are only in it for the 
money and just want to 
take and take. 1 am more 
of a one-man show. I can 
do it all." 
He proved 
that to be 
true on 
Saturday, 
em- 
20th 
Rhine-

Curio peiforms at his latest show 



Curio performs with the 
completely on his own. 
He found the artists, pro- 
duced the show and even 
sunk in an awful lot of 
his oivn money all to give 
IPFW students something 
new and inventive to go 
to on a Saturday night. He 
says, "I would love to put 
a show like this on here at 
IPRV maybe three times a 
year. I want to give college 
kids something to do here 
in Fort Wayne other than 
shop or go to Pierre's." 

This was a great idea 
and would have been a 
massive show had certain 
complications not arisen. 
Besides not being nearly 



dancers of Caution Dance 
advertised enough, Curio 
expected to have seven 
acts consisting of famous 
local artists Mo Cheese 
and Amanda Perez, but 
unfortunately some of 
these artists did not fol- 
low through. Mo Cheese 
would have been there 
but was in a semi-serious 
car accident prior to the 
show (as was told by MC 
and radio host Big Kess of 
Wild 96.3). 
This did not shake Curio, 
and the show still went on 
and went well. It was ex- 
citing to see all of these 
talented artists like J Ray, 
Randall, DeA Dreamz,

Crew on Saturday at the Rhinehart Music Center 
and others show up to 



perform. The auditoriur 
was not packed but had 
a good amount of sup- 
portive and excited fans. 
Even some of IPFW's own 
students performed with 
Curio in the last act. Some 
of these performers con- 
sisted of Nathalie Garces, 
founder of Caution Dance 
Crew and Stepfanie John- 
son, Adam Willen, Takei- 
sba Read, and Isaac Mill- 
er. "This is really just good 
exposure, and I look at 
Saturday as sort of a step- 
ping stone for my career." 
Said Curio two nights be- 
fore Uie show. 



Afterwards Curio seemed 
lighthearted and happy. 
As for how he believed 
the show went, he slated, 
"It wasn't the turn out we 
expected, but that is okay. 
I'll just he working thai 
much harder on my next 
three albums," I think I 
speak for most people 
who came to the show 
when I say that we hope 
Curio comes back and 
thank him for giving it all 
he had Saturday night.

Caution Dance Crew Heats Up 



By Marisha Zimmerman 

Erfiloi ol Arts and Entertainment 



Caution Dance Crew is 
certainly unique. The 
crew is composed of 
IPFW students from vari- 
ous backgrounds, inter- 
ests, and strengths who 
are all united by a love of 
dance and performance. 

The founding member of 
the crew. Nathalie Garces, 
says tile crew started out 
a couple years ago as 
Azucar Dance Companj', 
which primarily f^ispanic. 
The name was changed 
to Caution Dance Crew 
when new members were 
added in order reach ,i 
broader, more muhunl 
tural audience and m 
order to be more versa- 
tile and varied with their 
dances. 

The crew's goal is to cre- 
ate a repenoire of dances 
tliat can be used in a vari- 
ety of perfomtances from 
hip-hop to salsa to belly 



dancing to modem dance. 
The crew has been keep- 
ing busy preparing these 
routines and performing 
at various venues. Most 
recently, they performed 
witli Curio at his latest 
concert at the Rhinehart 
Music Center, which was 
one of die crew's first 
performances as the new 



Caution Dance Crew. 

Their next perfoi 
include Noche de Gala on 
October 4 at the Marriott 
in celebration of Hispanic 
Heritage Month and the 
Jorge Gonzalez Benefit 
Concert at Headwaters 
Park on September 27. 
Watch out for their up- 
coming perfoi

A festival in a worl 



By Louisa Danielson 

staff Writer 



Saturday, September 
20 - time stood still. A soft 
mist in the cool morning 
air hung over the St. Jo- 
seph River, blurring out 
the modern world and 
enclosing the )ohnny Ap- 
pleseed Festival in a world 
of its own, fiill of history, 
craftsmen, musicians and 
food. 

Festival goers filed 
through piles of ripe 
squash and orange pump- 
kins as they ambled to- 
wards the Festival Stage. 
Among the many shoiv5 
and acts to watch were 
the Inclogniio KJoggers 
and the Ft. Wayne Suzu- 
ki Players. The doggers 
danced to numbers such 
as "Cotton Eye Joe" while 
the Suzuki Players per- 
formed everything from 
classical music to fiddle. 
Barbecue smoke tvafted 



over the crowds, entic- 
ing people to sample the 
many kinds of food avail- 
able. Caramel corn was 
quite popular, as were 
caramel apples and fun- 
nel cakes. Ail foods were 
made in a manner that 
would have been possible 
when Johnny Appleseed 
was alive. Cooking fires 
were set in large metal 
washtubs. sometimes 
with metal smoke stacks 
attached to keep the 
smoke from getting into 
people's eyes. The caramel 
corn was made in giant 
ketdes. stirred by wood- 
en paddles. The kernels 
would simmer in the pot, 
then explode into a ter- 
rific frenzy of white (luff, 
peppering the ground 
like snow. Popcorn that 
stayed in the keitie was 
transferred to brown pa- 
per bags and enjoyed by 
customers. 

Of the crafts for sale, 
many were traditionaJ 
to the festival - spicy 



potpourri, dried flower handle 

arrangements, carved slate li 

woodwork, and quilts, treasure 

But some were more this fesi 

unique, such as spoon- wbo wt.

Another great attraction

The Great Duck School 

Displayed artist, Douglas Baldwin, visits IPFW 



By Kelly McLendon 

SutfWtrler 



Douglas Baldwin's slide 
show and lecture on 
Thursday the IBih was 
u very relaxed, yet re- 
fined event. Casual and 
straightforward, Baldwin 
appeared to present his 
slides in simple khakis 
and a striped shin. Fie 
presented himself not 
only as an artist who con- 
nects well with his audi- 
ence, but as a ceramicist 
profoundly influenced 
by his 



works of art. 

The event promptly be- 
gan at six and the lights 
were shut off, with com- 
plete darkness flooding 
the second floor room 
of the Visual Arts build- 
ing. The only illuminated 
object was Baldwin's face 
and also his larger re- 
flection exposed on the 
screen behind him. He 
started the presentation 
joking with the audience. 
His jovial attitude would 
become a theme for the 
evening lecture. 

As the clunky echo- 
ing of each 




slide switching persist- 
ed, Baldwin narrated his 
photos. One was a pic- 
ture from when he spent 
time touring Greece and 
others consisted of his 
works, such as The Great 
Duck Wood Fire School. 
The dim-lit lecture haU 
was tilled with peopleand 
the flash of slides made 
the atmosphere. Bald- 
win went through slides 
room by room of 
The Great Duck 
School, laugh- 
ing about a 
'duck rub- 
dovm room", 
where the 
ducks get 
massages 
after a 
day.

This ad courtesy of the Office of the Chancellor 



showed construction to 
destruction pieces and 
the process of creating a 
work of art. Also includ- 
ed were many detailed 
photos of his stadium 
project. In particular, 
there was one stadium 
filled with corn, another 
with chili peppers, and 
a final with ice cream 
cones. Every piece had a 
story, which Baldwin told 
with delight. Speaking 
about motivation and in- 
spiration. Baldwin said, 
"We're influenced by 
some thing's more than 
others." 

The audience was 
thoroughly entertained 
throughout the entire 
show, which only lasted 
about forty-five minutes. 
Baldwin showed one ran- 
dom upside-down slide, 
which provided a few 
laughs. He seemed to use 
his humor as an artistic 
complement. 

The exhibit currently 
in the Visual Arts build- 
ing is The Great Duck 
Wood Fire School. Bald- 
win said, "I've made a 
lot of schools. I say never 
again, but I always do it. " 
At the end of the slides, 
the session was opened 
up for a question and an- 
swer format. One IPFW 
student, who identified 
himself as Greg, asked 
Baldwin how he made 
the transition from un- 
dergrad to artist. Baldwin 
said his success didn't re- 
ally happen directly out 
of school. He said humor 
and his love of teaching 
went into the creation of 
the duck schools. Also, 
he said he gives away 
more of his artwork than 
he sells, showing that the 
art is more important to 
him than the money he 
could earn from it. Other 
questions included what 
glazing techniques he 
used on pieces and what 
success he gained from 
the stadium collections. 

Among the various 
works of art he has creat- 
ed, Baldwin has also held 
many teaching positions 
and one-person exhibits; 
as well as an endless list- 
ing of group exhibitions. 
In addition, he has been 
quoted in many maga- 
zines and newspapers. 
When asked why he had 
the idea to use ducks in 
his work. Baldivin said. 
"It could have just as eas- 
ily been a squirrel." His 
artwork can be vieived 
until September 29th in 
the Visual Arts Building 
^nd also on his website

Where, what, and how to find out more about studying abroad 



By KELLY MCLENDON 



If spending a semes- 
ter studying in a foreign 
country is someihingyou 
maybe interested in, you 
shouJd go to one of the 
Study Abroad Informa- 
tion Sessions in KT 119. 
The next session will be 
on Thursday September 
25th at A p.m. 

The very first step to 
getting your plans set for 
overseas study starts with 
the information session. 
If you're still interested 
after that, you can check 
out the Office of Interna- 
tional Programs website 
(ww^v.ip^v.edu/oip/) for 



more detailed informa- 
tion about the countries 
you could study abroad 
in. Next, you would fill 
out the Study-Abroad- 
Inquiry-Form, which is 
posted on the Office of 
International Programs 
website. The folloiving 
step would be to make 
an appointment with 
the director. Dr. Jenny 
Weatherford, where you 
will review your form and 
discuss your options. Af- 
ter you meet with the di- 
rector a few times, you 
could be on your way to 
an exciting adventure! 

Weatherford wrote 
about the many advan- 
tages of studying abroad 
on the International Pro- 



grams website. She said, 
"Students who take ad- 
vantage of study abroad 
find the experience to be 
life changing in very sig- 
nificant ways. Not only 
does overseas study af- 
ford students a new per- 
spective on the world 
and their own countries; 
it also gives them novel 
insights into themselves. 
You may find that be- 
ing in a foreign country 
for an extended time 
brings out sides of your 
personality that have 
lain dormant or perhaps 
even been repressed by 
the conservative atmo- 
sphere of Indiana. You 
may discover new inter- 
ests, new abilities, new 



loves — even those of a 
romantic sort!" 

If you're apprehensive 
about studying abroad 
because of monetary is- 
sues. Dr. Weatherford 
has an answer for that, 
"Financial aid can be 
applied to most lU and 
Purdue study abroad 
programs, and even stu- 
dents who don't current- 
ly receive financial aid 
may he eligible for aid for 
overseas programs. Also, 
IPFW students may ap- 
ply for special overseas 
study scholarships. " 

Wfiether you'd like 
to do scientific research 
in the rainforests of 
Australia, or study in- 
ternational business 



in Denmark, there is a 
study abroad program 
out there designed with 
your interests in mind. 
Plus, if you've been tak- 
ing foreign language for 
a few semesters, some 
programs do require cer- 
tain proficiency. There 
are. however, countless 



programs which do not 
have a foreign language 
requirement. Visit Pur- 
due's study abroad web- 
site at MTivw.studyabroad. 
purdue.edu or Indiana's 
at http://www.lndiana. 
edu/ -overseas/ for more 
information. Bon Voy- 
age!

Finding their stride 

■ Women's volleyball team opens home and Summit League perfect with pair of wins 




By Dan Vance 

SpOrU Edit 01 

The slow Stan is fading and the wheels are turning 
at a hopeful run towards a Summit League crown for 
coach Kelly Marttey-Hutton and her Mastodons. 

After a rough lime in season opening invitaEionals, 
the team won all three matches this past week, 
including topping t^vo league opponents in their first 
two home matches. Ail-in-all, the team has now won 
four matches in a row. 

The strong week started last T\jesday with a 3-0 
dismantling on Eastern Michigan. 

Team kill leader Jessica Miller got her kill total back 
in the double-digits with a team high 13. Rebekah 
Roehm posted her third double-double of 2008 ivith 
12 kills and 19 digs in the win. 

In Saturday's home opener with Missouri-Kansas 
City, the Mastodons staned slow but came back to 
ivin 3-1 {22-25. 25-8. 25-21, 25-21). The team was 
led by Miller (14 kills) and Roehm (13 kills). Roehm 
also achieved her second straight double-double and 
fourtli overall. 

In tlie big second game, Roehm and lamie Schwartz 
were killer on the serve and the team took advantage 
of UMKC's hitting weaknesses. The two combined for 
three service aces in the game and Schwartz added 
t^vo more at other times in the match. 

IPRV tt-as down by as many as three points mid- 
match beforc rallying by the Kangaroos in the fourth 
game. Four of IPFW's last five points of the game

Mayara Schhndwein and Roehm each had 10 kills 
for the Mastodons, who actually had three less total 
kills than the Grizzlies. 

lessica Dominiak and Ashley Dillon each reeled off 
three of the team's nine service aces. Dillon also had 
12 digs and five kills while Dominiak set up 18 bails 
while splitting sener duties with Shannon Reuter. 

IPBV is the only 2-0 team in Summit League play. 
North Dakota State, lUPUl and Western Illinois are 
all 1-0. Defending league champions South Dakota 
State are 1-9 overall. 

With the three- win week. Hartley- Hulton is now two 
wins away from winning her 200th match at IPI^'. 
She could accomplish the task as early as Saturday at 
Oral Roberts, the preseason conference favorite. The 
team plays again at home on September 30 against 
Wright State. 



St. Francis shows no 
flash as Mastodons 
win first of season

The win was the first for ihe Mastodons who 
moved to Cl-5-1) on the year while the Red Flash

Indiana's Lewis shows 
struggle with Ball St. 

By Lee Hurwitz 

Indiana Dalty Student - U-WIHE 



Kellen Lewis misses James Hardy, and on 
Saturday night, it showed. 

The world Lewis lives in — one where Hardy 
is no longer available as his favorite target - 
came crashing dovm as Bail State's 66th-ranked 
defense easily held the Hoosiers to one offensive 
louchdoivn. 

Losing 42-20 in a dramatic setback for the 
Hoosiers. it was Lewis who looked lost on a 
continuous defense. The defense had its fair share 
of gaffes, but Lewis, who is ranked as one of the 
best quanerbacks in the Big Ten, erred all night. 

"1 was rushing myself a litde too much," Lewis 
said. "This was the first game that we've been 
down and obviously, we never really had the lead. 
It's something we have to learn from." 

Levvis overthrew errant passes, as other throws 
were rocketed into his receivers' hands, only lo 
bounce ouL 

He completed two passes for more than 40 yards 
-- both to junior wide receiver Andrew Means - 
- and ran for 148 yards and a touchdown, but he 
was clearly off in the passing game. 

After compledng 3-of-5 passes to start the game, 
Lewis failed to connect on all six of his attempts 
in the second quarter, ivith two throws resulting 
in inteicepdons. The second of his picks proved 
most costly.

Men's Tennis opens at Detroit Invitational

Titians Invitational in Detroit, Michigan. The two-day, seven round 
tournament was held at Mercy High School in Farmington Hills. 

For the event, Ihe Mastodons took home tides in five singles (lights and 
one doubles llight. The single flight winners were H4 Felipe Gama (3-1), #5 
Ryan Vogt (3-11. t)6 Luis Maselli (4-0), #7 Rodrigo Tamashiro (3-0) and #8 David 
Lynall (4-0). Overall, the leam went 22-9 in singles and 4-4 in doubles.

David Lynall, who went a combined 12-0 in doubles and singles on the weekend. 

Following the event, IPFW men's tennis coach Eric Bums had this to say about 
the team's overall performance. 

"We got oflf to a slow start on Saturday and we were not too sharp on some 
couils, but we improved on Sunday and we fought hard in all matches. I tliink 
we know we can play better as an overall team than we did, but we gutted out 
some tough matches and we should be proud of the effort. We need to work on 
our conditioning and try to get in bener shape so we will be more willing to play 
smarter points. We also must work harder on being aggressive in doubles. It is 
early in the season and we have a long way to go, but all in all, we had a pretty 
good first meet. We're just looking to work hard and improve for the Ball State 
Invitational in two weeks."

The Root 

Backing up lo Ihe 
1950's, a group of highly 
skilled experts in com- 
modities and currencies 
who were able to exploit 
inefficiencies in the mar- 
ket, catered to a group of 
wealthy Investors willing 
to gamble for extraordi- 
narily high returns. By 
avoiding discloser re- 
quircmenis by U.S. secu- 
rity laws, investors didn't 
and still don't have to tell 
anyone how much they 
made nor how the mon- 
ey was spent. 

To this day Ihe gener- 
al public has no idea how 
these investments work 
because of their com- 
plex hush - hush nature, 
and to gel into a fund, 
you need to invest S2.5 
million. Needless lo say, 
running your ovm hedge 
fund is Ihe fastest way to 
make a fortune on earth. 

The Hedge 

For one. these funds 
arc addicted to leverage, 
or loaning money Con- 
sider for example a bank, 
like Lehman Brothers, 
thai may loan a hedge 
fund $50 million. By 



ing that mass amount of 
money from one stock to 
another, fund managers 
are essentially hedging 
or shortening one stock 
price for the risk of an- 
other appreciating stock. 

One could argue that 
these investors are irre- 
sponsible and have con- 
tributed to bank failures 
and global economic 
stress. 

"What do .'Uneri- 



as you know, is fabulous." 
smirks Beets. 

"The dollar rally over 
the last two months was 
unsustainable and it was 
brought about by short 
-term liquidation pres- 
sures by many hedge 
funds and because of a 
mistaken feeling that the 



US 



mbers 



had turned the corner- 
said head of investment 
research at Bank lu- 



"Could these investors be the 

conductors of our train, text 

messaging their next financial 

move, while we speed blindly 

toward disaster?" 



cans want?" asks IPFW 
accounting and fi- 
nance major, Diane 
Beets. "Newer and bet- 
ter things. There are all 
these old houses on the 
market, but people want 
new. Nalurally, inventory 
increases, price is going 
dovvn, but the demand is 
low. People are losing eq- 
uity'," she added. 
"The lious 



lius Baer, Anatha Nag- 
eswaran. 

The insecurides and 
distrust of these hedge 
funds caused a lot of 
money to be taken out 
of the market. Panic cre- 
ated unhealthy hedging 
and assei liquidation, re- 
sulting in a market crash 
that caused banks with 
huge loans to go bank- 
rupt - they couldn't cover 



their losses. 

Where financial free- 
dom was given two de- 
cades ago, the govern- 
ment has stepped in to 
clean up. Could these 
investors be the con- 
ductors of our train, text 
messaging their next fi- 
nancial move, while we 
speed blindly toward di- 
saster? 

The Aftermath 

According to a CNN 
money report, persistent 
marketing, coupled with 
a lack of financial experi- 
ence, many students will 
fall prey to credit card 
companies and into se- 
rious debi. "Some limes 
all it lakes is a free soda 
or a sandwich to rope in 
a college student," 

IPFW assistant pro- 
fessor of economics, Dr. 
Nodir Adilov recognizes 
the current troubles in 
the financial sector. " I 
expect interest rates on 
credit card balances lo 
increase. This could be 
particularly relevant for 
students carrying high 
balances on tlieir credit 
cards. Due to the in- 



creased uncertainty, it 
is hard for business and 
people lo obtain any 
kind of loan. Similarly," 
he adds, "students could 
face higher interest rates 
if they plan lo obtain stu- 
dent loans." 

"How much the 
school budgets (and tu- 
ition) will be affected in 
coming years and is yet 
to be seen. We ivill have 
a belter idea about it sev- 
eral months from now," 
said Adilov. 

Many of these sectors 
of our economy are in- 
tertwined. If il becomes 
harder for small and 
midsized businesses lo 
take out loans and obtain 
credit, there is a chance 
for less employment. 
Adilov believes this is 
something that could af- 
fect graduating students 
because it takes longer 
lo find a job in a weaker 
economy. 

Nolinghow less build- 
ing contracts were issued 
in response lo the weak 
housing market, Beets 
agrees saying, "We won't 
be seeing the real effects 
of this until sbt months 
down the road."
