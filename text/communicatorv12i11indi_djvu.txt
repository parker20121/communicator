Psychic promises local predictions 



Jeane Dixon visits campus 



Jeane Dixon 



By DEBBIE CANTWELL 

When Jeane Dixon makes a 
prediction, people usually listen. 

Even her harshest critics can't deny 
that Dixon is one of the most publicized 
psychics in the world, and that the 
predictions she makes are just 
downright interesting because they 
Involve, among other things, world and 
national politics, Hollywood celebrities 
and natural disasters. 

Some people swear she was given a 
"gift from God." To these ardent 
believers, Jeane Dixon's word is as 
good as gold. After all, she was the one 
who predicted the assassinations of 
President Kennedy and his brother 
Robert, and the attempted 
assassination of Governor George 
Wallace. 

"The Lord gives us different gifts," 
she said in a telephone interview from 
her office in Washington, D.C. "He has 
revealed things to me that 1 have 
revealed to the public. Maybe he has 
chosen a dozen other people, but I think 
it all comes from the same Creator. 
We're all given talents." 

Well, Jeane Dixon's talent is the 
ability to see into the future. 

This year In Philadelphia, she 
predicted the Phillies would win the 
World Series in the sixth inning. That 
prediction made headlines there. 

"They said that (the prediction) was 
wrong because the Royals had a 
stronger team," she commented. "It 
isn't who is stronger, it's what is In the 
wind and the forces that are coming 
your way." 

Jeane Dixon will be coming IPFW's 
way tomorrow, Nov. 14, at 7 p.m., in the 
Walb Memorial Union Ballroom. Her 
lecture, entitled "My Life and 
Prophecies," is free to activity card 
holders and $2 for the public. 

"We all have psychic powers 
—animals do and plants do— or we 
wouldn't be alive, she explained 
"You're born with it." 

Dixon became aware of her own 
psychic gifts at an early age. When she 
was eight, she met a gypsy who gave 



"The Lord give us different gifts. He has 

revealed things to me that I have revealed to 

the public. Maybe he has chosen a dozen other 

people, but I think it ail comes from the 

same Creator. We're all given talents." 

Jeane Dixon 



her a crystal ball and predicted she 
would be "blessed with the gift of 
prophecy." 

Since that time, she has become a 
confidante of the famous and by way of 
her column— which is syndicated lo 
more than 300 newspapers— an advisor 
to the general public. She has also 
written four books, including the 
bestseller "My Life and Prophecies," 
in which she has documented her 
predictions until the year 2000. 

"Occasionally, the Lord gives me 
prophecies," Dixon said. A prophecy, 
she explained, is "the will of God." 
These visions cannot be changed by the 
will of humanity. 

The psychic also uses a crystal 
ball— of pure mined crystal which an 
Italian contessa purchased for her at a 
cost of (8000— to make predictions. 
These forecasts, however, are subject 
to change because human beings exert 
theirfree will. 

Consequently, a few of her more 
notable predictions have missed their 
mark. World War III did not break out 
In 1958 like she said It would, nor did 
President Lyndon B. Johnson get the 
Democratic nomination for the 
presidency of 1968. 

How does she react to those who scoff 
at her talent? 

"I like them very, very much," she 
answered. 

A prediction printed in the June 1967 
issue of Harpers Magazine, however, 
just hit its mark last week on election 
day. In the article, Dixon was quoted as 
saying that Governor Reagan of 
California was "destined for great- 



"I met Mr. Reagan In the early 1960s 
before he became Governor of 
California. I encouraged him to run for 
governor, telling him that it would be a 
stepping stone to the presidency of the 
United States," Dixon said. 

"I believe that Reagan, being a man 
of destiny, is coming to us and will 
perhaps do things that people do not 
like at the beginning. This is because it 
took a whole generation for these things 
to happen." 

Dixon said she doesn't believe the 
infamous "zero factor"— a legend that 
presidents elected In years ending In 
zero die In office— holds true and cited 
the years 1800 and 1820 as examples 
where the presidents served out their 
terms. 

"I'm not saying II won't hold true 
now," she said, "but it didn't hold true 
then. I'm not going to make a prediction 
on something like that. I think a 
prediction like that would not be ad- 
visable one way or Ihe other at the 
moment." 

If Dixon sounds like a Republican at 
heart, she's not. "Now I talk like a 
Republican," she stopped to explain, 
"other times I talk like a Democrat, 
and then I talk sometimes like an 
Independent," 

Although the psychic won't predict 
that Senator Edward Kennedy will win 
the 1984 election, she has said he 
"should not run until 1984, and that he 
would have a better chance then." 

But Kennedy's future In no way 
compares to that of a child born in 
Egypt on February 5, 1062 of humble 



peasants. Dixon has predicted the child 
will one day be the future World Leader 
and the "greatest power for world good 
since the coming of Christ." 

"I believe at the moment he is still in 
Cairo," she said and described the 
force this man will possess. "He is such 
a powerful leader of the people, that he 
will begin to think he is Jesus Christ 
himself, That is when he turns out to be 
the anti-Christ. 

"Then we the people will have a 
choice either to follow the man— the 
Lord our God— or follow a human 
being." 

In the meantime, Dixon will continue 
to make her predictions and remain 
actively engaged in real estate business 
with her husband, James L. Dixon. She 
also dedicates much of her time to the 
Children To Children Foundation, an 
organization she founded in 1963 to 
encourage pre-natal research. 

"My dedication in life is pre-natal 
research. All the money that is paid to 
me from speeches and radio and 
television goes to pre-natal research," 
she said, adding that over 25 percent of 
the children today are born with 
defects. 

"Thai's not because the Lord wants 
that or wills that. It is because I believe 
people have a lack of knowledge of how 
to prepare themselves," she continued. 

In addition to her work with Ihe 
Foundation, Dixon takes care of un- 
wanted animals and people. Her 
commitment to humanitarian service 
has been recognized by groups the 
world over, and the American public 
has named her one of the world's most 
admired women for three consecutive 
years. 

Needless to say, this woman Is very 
busy. After 15 minutes of questions and 
answers, she had to hang up because of 
a newspaper deadline. 

But before Jeane Dixon said good-by, 
she promised to make some predictions 
about Fori Wayne Friday night. 

"I'll have some interesting ones for 
you," she said. 

No doubt, shewlll. 



BSA 



reorganizes 



By CHERYL GIBSON 

Black students at IPFW are 
reorganizing the Black Student 
Assembly (BSA). 

Although not a new organization, the 
BSA, under the leadership of Gedalyah 
Ben-Shimeon, president, and Michel 
Edmonds, vice-president, is being 
reassembled for more effectiveness. In 
the future, BSA plans to be more in- 
volved with projects on and off campus. 

The group's leaders feel it is 
necessary for their members to be 
actively involved in school committees. 

Currently, Ben-Shimeon and 
Edmonds hold seats on the Student 
Senate, and during a recent meeting, 
members of the BSA were urged to fill 
vacant senate seats. 

Linda Newberry, a member, and 
Ben-Shimeon hold seats on the Affir- 
mative Action Committee. Affirmative 
Action deals with equal opportunity 
conflicts. The committee is now making 
a report involving why female 
professors at IPFW are making less 
money than their male co-workers. 
Newberry said this case is similar to 
other national cases based on 
discrimination due to our social and 
cultural heritage. 

BSA will also try to dispel derogatory 
stereotypes of blacks by educating both 
children and adulls whose views may 
resemble those of "Archie Bunker." 

In the education field, BSA is plan- 
ning to work with the Tutorial Service 
in helping inner-city children with 
English and math skills. Edmonds 
became aware of the problems children 
have with these skills while working for 
the Park Board and coming in contact 



with nine-year-olds who couldn't spell 
their own name. 

BSA is also concerned with making 
blacks aware of other available ser- 
vices. 

The group is considering bringing 
oustide speakers to IPFW. Through 
Manchester College, BSA is hoping to 
bring Andrew Young. 

During February — Black History 
Month — the BSA plans to bring the 
play, "For Colored Girls," to IPFW. 
The fee to bring the touring play is 
S3000, but the group hopes some 
community organizations will help with 
the cost. 

In addition, BSA has reserved three 
showcases in Kettlcr Hall for the month 
of February to be devoted to black 
culture and heritage. 

In a long-range goal, plans are being 
made to petition various newspapers 
and groups around the state to voice the 
problems of blacks. Edmonds said 
many scholarships and funds are not 
being used effectively because they are 
not widely publicized. 

"BSA is good or better than in past 
years," said Newberry, who holds high 
hopes for the reorganized group. 

Although the group is small, ranging 
from 25-30 members, there are only 395 
blacks enrolled this semester at IPFW 
out of 10,182 total students. That in- 
volves only four percent of the 
population at IPFW, and only three- 
tenths of a percent are actively in- 
volved. The number of black students is 
gradually increasing at IPFW. BSA is 
urging its members to urge young 
friends and relatives to go to college. 

"We needed to get started yesterday 
to destroy the prejudice," said Ben- 
Shimeon. 



Students learn to 
better themselves 



By CHERYL GIBSON 

How can we improve ourselves? 

Terry Johnson Chambers tried to 
answer that question with "Wellness 
Day"onNov.6. 

Chambers organized a similar event 
while in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. She then 
carried the idea to IPFW, where she is 
a counselor. 

Through a survey, Chambers 
realized the main concerns of students 
were ways to better themselves. She 
said doctors made students better when 
they were sick, but afterwards didn'l 
improve their health any more than 
before. 

The idea behind "A New You Day" 
was for individuals to be able lo im- 
prove themselves with their constantly 
changing environment. 

A few of the programs lasl week 
were; 

"Inlimacy: How In Get Some." Dave 



Joliff and Cindy Inniger had par- 
ticipants evaluate their "caring net- 
work" of friends and tell how they 
would change their "network." On a 
worksheet, participants evaluated roles 
ranging from sexual partners to 
spiritual colleagues. 

In interpersonal relations, Joliff said, 
■ person goes through several seoarate 
stages — encounter, affection, 
evaluation and intimacy. Although not 
all relationships go through every 
stage, some may end in conflict or 
never move past affection. 

Aerobics. Vickie Cockran of the 
YWCA explained and demonstrated 
aerobic dancing, which gets the blood 
flowing. This type of exercise is an 
overall body toner with continual 
movement, similar to jogging and 
swimming. The exercise starts with a 
10 minute warm-up, a 20-30 minute 
routine and a cooling down stage. 



Fund drive 
helps to aid 

local school 

By JIM CHAPMAN 
. The IU School of Public and 
Environmental Affairs (SPEA) 
wants to strengthen its national 
reputation in public service 
education. So, they're having a fund- 
raising drive. 

The drive, with the theme, 
"SPEA: A Partnership for the 
Second Decade," is being conducted 
in cooperation with the IU Foun- 
dation, and support from alumni and 
friends for unrestricted develop- 
ment funds Is being asked. 

The funds will be shared by five IU 
branches, according to need, The 
five branches are at Gary, South 
Bend, Indianapolis, Bloomington 
and Fort Wayne. 

The gifts will be used to establish 
new scholarships and fellowships, 
recruit and maintain distinguished 
faculty, Improve teaching curricula 
in keeping with trends and needs in 
the public sector, expand library 
holdings, finance new research and 
sponsor special lectures and related 
learning experiences. 

SPEA Dean, Charles Bonser, said 
the school has received significant 
funding from both private and public 
sectors, but he also noted critically 
important areas have remained 
unsupported, even though these 
funds have come in. 

"Faculty research activities and 
their professional development is 
one of the areas that is un- 
supported," said Roy Shin, IPFW 
SPEA director. 

Other important unsupported 
areas, along with the one Shin 
mentioned, will be targets for the 
fund-raising drive. 

The IU School of Public and 
Environmental Affairs was 
established in 1972. Its mission is to 
focus academic programs, research 
and services on finding solutions to 
problems created by people in- 
teracting with Iheir environment. 

The school also has a goal lo 
professionally train men and women 
who will create and manage public 
policy in the future. 

"We have come a long way in 
eight short years, as witnessed by 
state and national recognition and 
support of the school and its ob-

Soaps 'bubble 9 at IPFW 



By SUE SNODGRASS 

Dehilia, who has a split personality, 
killed Barry and shuffles the blame lo 
Faith, who has been sleeping with 
Frank ever since he left Jill, Faith's 
sister, because Jill had an affair with 
the terminally ill Ken and killed him 
with an overdose of heroin. 

Frank has just been indicted, 
allowing Luke, the underworld disco 
king turned cook, to win his battle 
against the organization, but resulting 
in the loss of his love Laura, whom he 
had earlier raped. 

All of this Is happening at IPFW. 

Don't look at the gorgeous blonde who 
sits next to you in psychology or the 
unsuspecting gentleman you team with 
in your biology lab — just look for Ihe 
assemblage of students and professors 
that hover around every television on 
campus. 

Yes, as you may have guessed, they 
are the soapees, or rather the devoted 
fans of the daytime drama, the soap 
opera. 

Whether it be "All My Children," 
"Ryan's Hope" or, everyone's all-time 
favorite, "General Hospital," the soap 
operas are drawing massive audiences 
and making millions of dollars from 
stories whose themes reek of marilal 
infidelity, blackmail, political anarchy 
and "sex, drugs and rock-and-roll." 

The soaps offer a variety of 
panaceas, said Hank Neuwar in the 



"Saturday Evening Post." 

Psychologists claim lhat soap operas 
are, for mosl viewers, a form of 
'projection.' The viewer can get lost 
inside the world of the soap, forget the 
day's problems and fantasize about 
being rich and famous. 

As Linda Mowery, an IPFW 
elementary education major, said, 
"You can step outside your own 
problems. The problems of Ihe soap 
operas are so exaggerated, it makes 
your own a little bit easier to handle." 

One IU alumni and dedicated soapee 
said. "They're funny. I watch them all. 
When you have a problem, soaps are so 
extremely dramatized, you can face 
your own (problems) easier. I like the 
villians, especially Ericka of "All My 
Children." There is a little bit of all of 
us in her." 

While most devotees see soaps as 
therapeutic, others such as Dr. Berg, a 
noted New York psychiatrist, see them 
as potential dangers. Berg said, "What 
will happen to a woman if she listens to 
serials all the time, (is that) she will 
experience increased blood pressure, 
nocturnal frights, vasomotor in- 
stability, vertigo, tremors and a slight 
touch of tachyacardia." 

Even if soap operas can produce such 
dreaded symptoms, Dr. Berg may be a 
bil prejudiced in limiting these com- 
plications to women. That's right, men 



are also joining the soapee front. 

Randy Imel, financial marketing 
major, said, "When I get out of class, 
soap operas give me a chance to relax. 
Most of the time I walch "General 
Hospital," and if I miss it during the 
week, I catch up on it on the weekends 
by reading the TV reviews. Besides, I 
think Laura Baldwin is good looking." 

The appearance of "Dallas'" J.R. 
Ewing may account for the increasing 
interest of men to soap operas. Most 
soaps depicted men as being preoc- 
cupied with their work and un- 
concerned with problems at home. Now 
this stereotype is changing and men are 
appearing more caring. Women 
characters have also broken their 
stereotypical molds and are now 
concerned with educated problems. 

For whatever reasons men and 
women watch soap operas, the fact, 
remains that the number of viewers are 
increasing. 

Who can resist when everyone knows 
that Ellen loves Paul, but is married to 
Mark; when Cybil is pregnant by 
Nina's husband Cliff, while Nina is 
going blind? 

And heaven only knows TV viewers, 
coast to coast, will continue to wait on 
the edge of their armchairs for the 
answer to the question looming 
foremost in Ihe minds of all good 
Americans — Who shot JR.?

Letter 



PAGE 2 — THE COMMUNICATOR — NOVEMBER 13. 1980 



Edmonds tells 
BSA purpose 



Parking hassles continue 

Needs peak 



Twenly-eight hundred of almost 
anything is a lot — 2,800 cookies, 2,800 
books, 2,800 paper clips, or 2,800 dogs, 

However, when it comes to parking 
spaces on this campus, 2,800 divided 
among the more than 10,000 full-time 
and part-time students and 300-plus 
faculty and staff members isn't enough. 

Perhaps at resident campuses, such as 
I.U. and Purdue, the one-to-four ratio of 
parking spaces to students is sufficient; 
here it is not. 

This is a commuter campus. The name 
itself implies that students will be 
coming onto the campus daily with 
vehicles, and the university must 
provide adequate parking. 

Of course, not all of the 10,000 students 
are on the campus at one time, but 
daring the peak hours — 9 to U a.m. and 
6 to 8 p.m. — more than 90 percent of the 
classrooms on the campus are in use. 
Complicating matters is that nearly all 
classes meet in Neff and Kettler halls, 
causing many students a long walk from 
outlying parking areas. 

We realize that the large increase in 
the number of students — 10.8 percent 
more this semester than last semester — 
was perhaps unforeseen. 

What we are proposing is that plan- 
ning be done now to alleviate the parking 
problems for future semesters. Several 
ideas come to mind that could help: 



1) Reactivate the carpooling program. 
The carpooling program, initiated last 
year by Students' Government, never 
got off the ground this fall, and re- 
gardless of the reasons behind this, a 
strong carpooling effort could go a long 
way to help solve the parking problems 
here. It must be reinstated. 

One incentive for getting more people 
to carpool might be to designate a 
special lot for those who carpool. 

2) Build a parking garage. Since one of 
(he main objections to creating more 
parking spaces on the campus is the loss 
of some of the landscaped areas — those 
green, grassy areas so important to the 
overall beauty of the campus — why not 
build a parking garage on the site of one 
of the existing parking lots? It could 
possibly be paid for by charging a fee for 
parking there, much as one pays to park 
in the city's parking garage. 

3) Enact some temporary emergency 
parking measures. This might include 
allowing parking on some of the now- 
landscaped areas (such as the lawns), 
providing a shuttle-bus service from a 
nearby commercial parking lot (such as 
Norlhcrest Shopping Center), or 
perhaps reshuffling class scheduling, 
keeping in mind the maximum number 
of students who will be enrolled during 
peak hours as compared to the number 
of parking spaces available. 



To the Editor: 

Black Student Assembly. 

What is it? What purpose 
does it serve? Is itimportant 
to us as students. We say yes. 

The difference between 
any two objects is 
manifested in the mind of 
that person's own ex- 
periences. Your culture, and 
the culture of others, is an 
excellent example of the two 
objects we speak of. We ask 
that this difference be 
analyzed because il Is a part 
of the beauty of life. Dif- 
ferences should not hinder 
you in trying to find out more 
concerning the lifestyles you 
know little about, even with 
your own culture, for this 
difference can enhance your 
life. 

In essence, these beliefs 
are representative of our 
goals, and at the same time, 
these beliefs pose as an 
invitation. It is an open in- 
vitation to anyone interested 
in the culture, the people and 
the progress of the assem- 
bly's combined individual 
talents. We await the input of 
your uniqueness in assisting 
us. 

We have come across 
many blockades in our 
search of discovering our 
cultural foundations. 
Historically, society has not 
provided sufficient in- 
formation or materials that 
a black person can use to 
find his cultural background 
in America, Many black 



people have overcome this 
blockade, and in their ac- 
complishments we have 
come to understand; the 
struggle for personal ex- 
cellence is within the 
potential of each individual. 
We have created — although 
unrecognized — we have 
fought — at times out- 
numbered, at times unap- 
preciated, therefore, we 
have learned to accomplish 
the impossible unrewarded. 

The black American 
struggle should be shared 
with all Americans, for it is a 
part of American history. 
We, as a group, would like (o 
recognize those black 
Americans who have 
assisted this country with a 
better understanding of the 
American way of life, and 
the belief of freedom, justice 
and mutual respect. 

Another purpose of this 
letter is to remove ihe false 
idea that Black Student 
Assembly is for black 
students only. The rose and 
the tulip are different yet 
possess their own separate 
beauty. We have been 
created differently, and it 
becomes a part of our 
purpose in life to overcome 
our differences, and 
negative ideas that stop us 
from being unified, sensitive 
and disciplined.

Death part of his job 



ByKIMKUZEFF 

Fred Woodward is no 
stranger to death. In fact, 
he makes his living from 
it. 

Woodward, 34, a 
student at IPFW, is an 
embalmer. 

The i mi ■ i [i;i&lt; ; ■ job 
begins where life ends 
with a call from a hospital 
or family member. The 
embalmer picks up the 
body and takes it to the 
funeral home. In Wood- 
ward's case, he would 
take the body to D.O. 
McComb &amp; Sons, where 
he has been employed for 
more than eight years. 

Before the embalming 
process can take place, 
Woodward must set the 
facial features and 
restore any damaged 



parts of the body. This 
process could take 
several hours, depending 
on the condition of the 
body. 

After the preliminaries, 
the embalming process Is 
initiated. The two-hour 
procedure begins with a 
small surgical Incision 
usually in the neck area. 
A formaldehyde-based 
embalming fluid Is in- 
jected into the exposed 
artery. This Injection 
forces blood to drain from 
a neighboring vein. The 
blood Is deposed of, and 
the body is ready lo be 
made-up and dressed the 
next day. 

Working with the dead 
doesn't usually bother 
Woodward. "The average 
person only thinks of the 



gross part of em- 
balming," Woodward 
said. "Actually, there's 
very little of thai," 

Woodward noted that 
embalming a young child, 
a good friend, or anyone 
he can relate to someone 
he knows, does bother 
him. He said his worst 
experience in embalming 
came when he had to 
embalm a good friend. 

Woodward derives 
personal satisfaction 
from his work. He said his 
satisfaction comes from a 
job well done and from 
helping the victims' 
families. 

"If embalm ers were In 
the job for money alone, 
they wouldn't stay In It," 
said Woodward. "The 
funeral business pays

horribly low," This is 
where the personal 
satisfaction comes into 
play. 

Another reason em- 
balming doesn't bother 
Woodward is that he is 
accustomed to working 
with the dead. 

His Interest in em- 
balming grew out of a 
childhood around a 
funeral home. When he 
was young, he played in 
his friend's grandfather's 
funeral home. When he 
turned 13, he was offered 
a job there, and he con- 
tinued working at the 
funeral home through 
high school. After 
graduation, going into the 
funeral business "seemed 
like the logical thing to 
do," Woodward said. 

Woodward graduated 
from an Indianapolis 
embalming school In 1966, 
and went on to get his 
embalming and funeral 
director's licenses. He 
has been an embalmer for 
14 years. 

Besides working a 46- 
hour week at D.O. 
McComb &amp; Sons, 
Woodward is taking 12 
credit hours at IPFW. His 
major is pre -medicine. 

His eventual goal is to 
be a general practitioner. 
Woodward mentioned 
that he decided not to 
specialize because of the 
extra time involved in 
becoming a pediatrician, 
his original goal 10 years 
ago when he first wanted 
to be a doctor. 

In the little spare time 
he has left, Woodward 
installs vinyl aluminum 
siding. He got into this 
specific second job 
because he wanted to 
learn to remodel arouse, 
just in case he ever 
needed to know how. 

"I like to keep busy. 
I've always had a second 
job Most of the jobs have 
been goof-off jobs, 
something to do," 
Woodward said. These 
jobs have included being 
a lifeguard and a sharp- 
shooter for the police. 

His hobbies also include 
hunting and fishing. 

Woodward, who resides , 
northeast of Fort Wayne , 
with his wife and three 
kids, said that though his. 
Icids know they don't want 
to get into the funeral 
business, his line of work 
doesn't bother them or his 
wife. "I leave work at 
work, and home at 
home," Woodward said.

Aharauwa, himself from

In the event of an 
enemy siege of a country, 
mass exodus always 
follows. Sometimes, 
running for one's dear life 
is taken for cowardice, 



but the truth is that the 
fleeing people run for 
good, and possibly to a 
sanctuary like the United 
States of America. 

Thus, Giang Truong, 20, 
a sophomore chemical 
engineering student at 
IPFW, came to Fort 
Wayne with his parents in 
1975, as the North Viet- 
namese soldiers invaded 
South Vietnam, his native 
home. 

Truong came into the 
U.S. as a refugee, but he 
is now on immigrant 
status. The act of 
magninimity toward 



strangers, characteristic 
of the U.S. people, is 
manifested in Truong, 
who is now well-adjusted, 
works at the Helmke 
Library as a shelver, and 
lives with his parents in 
Fort Wayne. 

Truong commended the 
student-teacher rela- 
tionship at IPFW and 
said, "The professors are 
good and give me per- 
sonal care." He said he 
likes IPFW, but is not 
happy with comments 
such as, "I am of I.U." 
and "I am of Purdue" 



made by some students. 

He is an advocate of 
oneness and wishes he 
could deter such a 
divisive attitude. 

Truong admitted he has 
the communication 
problems some foreign 
students normally en- 
counter, but said he is 
coping with the situation 
squarely. 

He also prays, he said, 
to see the new building 
and gym now under 
construction completed. 

His major interests in 
sports are volleyball, 
table tennis and tennis.

Reporter tackles mud, wrestlers 



By ROBERT 
RINEARSON 

For the previous week, all 
I thought of was I wanted to 
mud wrestle at the Scorpion. 

Through the grapevine, I'd 
heard war stories of how 
many a good man had tried, 
some successful, some not. 
I'd even seen the sport on 
Real People. But after 
friends of mine, Stan and 
Steve, witnessed the pin- 
nacle of female fortitude, 
they in turn encouraged me. 
I decided that mud wrestling 
was the sport for me. 

The object of mud 
wrestling is unique. First, a 
man stands in a -glass en- 
cased pit, calf deep in wet 
mud. In each corner, women 
stand ready to pounce on 
their victim. For the male to 
win the $50 in prize money, 
he has to pin the four women 
before they pin him . 

There was no thought of 
machismo on my part, nor 
was I out to make a stand 
against remininity. Instead, 
I felt it was a game of sur- 
vival. In the mud and the 
beer, I would make my 
stand, and I was determined 
to win. 

Finally, the day of the 
match arrived. I received 
several calls from friends, 
asking if I really intended on 
going through with the 
escapade. I never hesitated 
when I answered yes 

That night, I met several 
friends at the Shady Nook 
Bar for some warm-up 
beers. On television, 
everybody was watching 
Philadelphia rout Kansas 
City in the second game of 
the World Series. As it was, I 
happened to be a Kansas 
City fan 1 secretly prayed 
an omen hadn't been 
bestowed against me. 

The wrestling would start 
at midnight, and the hour 
had arrived for my depar- 
ture Downing one last beer, 



"There is no thought of machismo on my part, nor was / 

out to make a stand against femininity. Instead, I felt it was 

o game of survival. In the mud and beer, I would make my 

stand, and I was determined to win." 



I left the Shady Nook, 
escorted by Stan and Steve. I 
received several hearty 
words of support from those 
who remained behind 

As soon as the three of us 
arrived at the Scorpion, a 
wild melee broke out be- 
tween a couple of drunk 
patrons and the bouncers. 
With fists lashing out and 
broken glass flying. It soon 
cooled. I was left with an 
eerie illusion of getting a 
beer mug upside my head 
during the match. 

The time had arrived. I 
was immediately taken 
aback by the number of 
hands that shot up from 
other fellows hoping lo be 
chosen as the guinea pig. But 
convinced as I was that it 
was my destiny, I slowly 
raised my hand. 

Stan and Steve began 
jumping up and down, 
pointing at me and 
screaming my nickname, 
Rhino. 

The master of ceremonies 
glanced at me once, scanned 
the rest of the crowd, Ihen 
looked back and pointed to 
me. I was the one to wrestle 
tonight. 

A rather thin girl in a one- 
piece swimsuit led me 
downstairs to the dressing 
room. 

I was led into a room 
where other women were 
either preparing themselves 



for the next show on stage, or 
getting ready to leave. 

One of the women handed 
me a pair of gym shorts and 
informed me I could either 
dress there or in a side room. 
Slightly embarrassed. I 
chose the isolation of the side 
room- 
Emerging in only trunks, I 
received hoots and cat calls, 
first from the ladies in the 
dressing room, then from the 
spectators in the arena. 

Observing the audience, it 
seemed there were men 
from ail walks of life. Iron 
workers, lawyers, industrial 
laborers and real estate 
agents all choked down beer. 
I could hear Stan and Steve 
yelling above everybody 
else: "Rhino, Rhino, Go get 
'em Rhino." 

Temporarily blinded by 
the spotlight, I stepped into 
the pit of mud and looked at 
my opponents. 

Each was already in her 
corner. One looked to be 
about 5'10" and 160 pounds. 

Another chomped hard on 
what I speculated to be 
bubble gum. 

The third one was smaller, 
but I couldn't trust her just 
the same. 

The last one was smiling, 
but was gargantuan. 

I wondered if she was 
thinking about breaking my 
neck. 

All of the women were 



dressed in swimsuits and 
caked in mud. 

1 stood in the middle, alone 
with my chills, as the master 
of ceremonies introduced me 
to the crowd. 

"Are you ready, sir?" he 
asked. 

"Ready," I answered, 
gulping hard. 

Then, I heard the clang of 
the bell. I wasted no time in 
getting to the tallest one 
first, before the other three 
could converge on me. 
Grabbing her, I lifted her 
high, bringing her down with 
a loud splat in the mud. 

The mud creeped across 
her shoulders as I pressed 
my weight against her. All 
the while, her comrades 
pulled al my hair and legs. 

I couldn't hear the yells of 
the crowd, only count from 
the referee. "One... 
two.. .three." The firsl 
one was pinned. 

Three more to go, and the 
boys in the crowd loved it. 

It didn't lake the other 
three long to wise up to my 
strategy of moving fast. This 
time they got to me first. 
Eventually, I got the second 
one in the mud, but I didn't 
hear a count. Instead. I 
heard a whistle. The referee 
claimed [ had an illegal 
choke hold on her. We 
started again. 

1 went after the same one. 
I found out it was becoming 



increasingly harder to fight 
off the other two. 

Again. I heard the whistle. 
This time a wrestler was 
against the plexiglass side. 
The pin had to come in the 
middle of the pit. I was tiring 
quickly. All the while, I had 
my own visions of drowning 
beneath the mud. 

But fortunately, I got the 
woman in a cradle hold. 
"One," screamed the 
referee. Meanwhile, the 
bigger of the two women who 
were free had gotten me In a 
headlock. Desperately I 
struggled to hold my cradle 
hold. "Two." One more 
second and I was sure my 
head would come off 
"Three." I fell back in 
exhaustion, but relieved. 

By now, Stan and Steve 
had the entire crowd loudly 
chanting my name. 
"Rhino.. .Rhino.. .Rhino." All 
cheered In unison between 
gulps of beer. 

Wearily. I glanced at the 
remaining two. I realized I 
had lo make quick time of it 
if I wanted the $50. 

I dropped the third like a 
fallen tree. While I 
positioned my pin on her, the 
remaining woman pulled 
hard at my hair. When that 
didn't work, she pulled al my 
gym trunks. 

"Get him off me please," 
the girl beneath me pleaded. 



"One," said theref. 

"Get him off." 

"..Two. ...Three." The 
crowd was in a frenzy. I had 
only one more to go. 

By now, seeing my ad- 
vantage, I started feeling an 
inner strength, which 
overcame my tiredness. 
Though my remaining op- 
ponent's strength was 
drained, her expression 
assured me she wasn't going 
to give up. 

Gang, went the bell. I let 
my determination take over. 
As I moved a bit too quick, I 
slipped and fell in the mud at 
her feet. In a flash, she was 
on me. This was survival. 
Using all my strength, I was 
able to reverse her. 

I pressed my shoulders 
against hers. I could feel her 
muscles relax as the mud 
oozed around her neck, 
leaving only the whiteness of 
her face showing from the 
blackness. 

"Three." I hadn't even 
heard the rest of the count. 

The house exploded in 
cheers and congraulations. 

I pulled my opponent 
from the mud and quickly 
apologized. "Don't worry, 
man. That was a good clean 
match," she consoled me. 
The other three also 
congratulated me, trying to 
cool any second misgivings I 
had. 

Soon enough , the master of 
ceremonies was shaking my 
muddy hand. "After you 
shower, just come and pick 
your fifty up at the bar," he 
said. I thanked him. 

As I turned, I noticed Stan 
and Steve had both taken 
their seats and ordered a 
round of beers. Others 
likewise resumed their 
recreational activities. But 
some men continued their 
cheering. Seeing the women 
wrestlers pinned was their 
obsession, and I was merely 
an actor in the play.

Forbert is fresher 



By STEVE RIEGEL 

Now that "The River" is 
out, we finally have some 
new music from Bruce 
Springsteen to serve as a 
benchmark for today's 
quality rock and roll. But, it 
may be that a more viable 
sound now comes from Steve 
Forbert's new album, "little 
Stevie Orbit." 

Springsteen has continued 
to set the standard in in- 
telligent, high powered rock, 
but after five albums, it is all 
beginning to sound like just 
more Bruce Springsteen 
music. It almost seems as if 
he has been hanging around 
Asbury Park too long, letting 
himself go stale. 

Forbert is fresher. 

What we have here is a 
classic case of a country boy 
confronting the big city and 
winning. Forbert moved to 
New York from Meridian, 
Mississippi in 1976, deter- 
mined to make it in the 
music business. He made it 
because, as an outsider, he 
had a wider perspective on 
the whole music scene. 

After his first album, 
"Alive on Arrival," Forbert 
was hailed by some as "the 
new Dylan." But he refused 
to let himself be typecast so 
easily. "Jackrabbit Slim," 
his second album, led many 
writers to think of him as a 
New Wave folkie. 

With his new album, 
Forbert once again sidesteps 
his critics and transcends his 
influences. His is a living 
talent that is growing into a 
category of its own. 

The music on the album is 
in a variety of styles and 
moods. Forbert is versatile 
enough to move freely 



among driving rock, sen- 
sitive ballads and lilting 
country in a program that 
includes something for 
everyone. 

Lyrically, Forbert's songs 
don't quite equal the in- 
tensity of Springsteen's 
observations, but almost. He 
obviously enjoys playing 
with the language. His songs 
provide an aloof com- 
mentary on the American 
way of life. He exposes 



shallowness and hypocrisy 
with a touch of whimsical 
irony that makes the 
medicine more fun than 
bitter. 

The songs, the band, and 
the production all come 
together flawlessly on 
"Little Stevie Orbit." 
Forbert plays with an in- 
fectious feeling that is hard 
to describe. But, like he says 
on side two, "If you've gotta 
ask, you'll never know.

An exhibit of -recent 
sculpture by 11a Seltzer 
opens this Friday in 
Artlink's large gallery and 
runs through Dec. 9. Ms. 
Seltzer says of her work, 
"Over a period of time I have 
discovered that the 
process— the method I use to 
create my sculpture— is 
more important than the 



visual images; this is not to 
deny the image at all, as it is 
intrinsic to and expressive of 
the process." 

On the evening of the 
opening, the . Fort Wayne 
Dance Collective Touring 
Company will present a 
premier performance of 
"Sundrop," a dance based on 



at S p.m. At 8:30 p.m., 
Seltzer will give a gallery 
talk about her work. 

Ms. Seltzer received her 
MA in Sculpture from the 
University of Wisconsin, 
Madison, and received her 
Bachelors of F-ine Arts from 
Florida State University. 



Art student visits 



By JACKIE NITECKI 

As a result of mutual 
needs. D?FW and the Fort 
Wayne School of Fine Arts 
merged, providing an ex- 
ceptional facility for art 
instruction. One person 
particularly impressed with 
available courses was a 
visitor from Takaoka, 
Japan, Ms. Tomi Urayama. 

Ms. Urayama (ooh-rye- 
ah'-mah) came to Fort 
Wayne on a business trip 
four years ago with her 
husband. During their two- 
year stay, she enrolled in the 
art school. Prior to these 
classes, Ms. Urayama was 
aware of her keen interest in 
art, but had never actually 
drawn or painted. Com- 
bining the excellent training 
available at the school and 
Ms. Urayama 's obvious 
natural talent, an ac- 
complished artist emerged. 

In 1978, Ms. Urayama 
returned to Japan with her 
husband, but kept in mind 
her desire to return to Fort 
Wayne, her new friends and 

At the movies 



the art institute. She worked 
for a kimono manufacturer, 
putting her talent to use in 
painting the silk kimonos, a 
traditional oriental art 
specialty. 

The kimonos are not 
everyday apparel, but they 
are still Important for 
special occasions, par- 
ticularly weddings. The 
more elaborate the art work 
on the kimono, the more 
valuable it becomes. A 
recent Today Show segment 
displayed a kimono valued at 
several hundred thousand 
dollars. 

Ms. Urayama found the 
surroundings on the job 
confining and the work dull, 
but opportunities to earn a 
living through art are 
limited, and the work 
provided a way back to Fort 
Wayne. 

Ms. Urayama will be here 
a brief two weeks as a guest 
of Mr. and Mrs. Timothy 
Shelton. From Fort Wayne, 
Tomi will go on to Princeton, 
New Jersey, and then home 



to Japan. 

Before visiting the school, 
I had expected Ms. 
Urayama's art work to be 
quite different from 
traditional western art. I 
was sure I would see the 
oriental style of wood-cut or 
the silk painting so often 
associated with Japanese 
art. 

Instead, as I entered the 
upstairs studio Tomi and 
several other students share, 
I found a beautiful oil par- 
trait of her niece. The 
general style was western, in 
that it dealt with a single 
human subject, while 
oriental art tends to deal 
with nature and landscapes. 

Perhaps that Is one of the 
reasons Tomi found the 
factory work dull. Her art 
style is quite different from 
what one would find on any 
kimono. In this case, it was a 
beautiful pastel portrait that 
Tomi emphasized was 
nowhere nearly done. Itwas, 
even In the unfinished state, 
beautifully delicate and 
appealing.

On the silver screen 



ByMlKEGEFFEN 

"The Stunt Man" Is not 
merely a film. It is an ex- 
perience. 

The film moves at a diz- 
zying pace, hurling its 
audience into a world of 
kaleidoscopic images that 
tread the borderline of 
illusion and reality. 

The film changes per- 
spectives as frequently as a 
chameleon changes colors. 
Every frame of the film 
bristles with life and seems 
to jump off the screen, right 
at the audience. 

"The Stunt Man" is a film 
that defies labels. It is a 
satire, adventure, thriller, 
allegory and character- 
study. The most amazing 
.thing about it is that it works 
on all of these levels. For any ' 
one film to succeed at Just .' 
one of these levels would be 
laudable, but the fact that 
"The Stunt Man" succeeds 
at them all is unbelievable. 

The film's unique balance 
is due to director Richard 
Rush. After years of making 
horrid films like "Getting 
Straight" and "Freebie And 
The Bean," Rush can finally 
step into the ranks of first- 
class directors. His film has 
a kinetic energy that is 
overwhelming. 

"The Stunt Man" has a 
deceptively simple plot. A 
fugitive named Cameron is 
running away from the 
polite He finds asylum with 
a movie company that is 
shooting a World War I epic. 
The company needs another 
stuntman to replace one that 
died In a car crash. The 
director, Eli Cross, hides 
Cameron, knowing that he is 
wanted by the police. 

What ensues is a clash of 
wills between Cameron and 
Eli. Is Eli, as Cameron

suspects, trying to kill him 
for the climax of the film? 

Cameron is the audience's 
eyes. We see everything 
from his perspective, and as 
his perspective changes, so 
does ours. 

"The Stunt Man" contains 
fantastically complex 
performances that are on as 
many levels as the film. 
Peter O'Toole gives his 
finest performance in years. 
As Eli Cross, he creates a 
complex, compelling In- 
dividual. 

Cross is many things to 
many people. He Is, alter- 
nately, a Lord of the shoot, 
playing with people's lives, 
a friend to everybody, a 
complete professional trying 
for perfection; and a 
meglomaniac yVhii needs 
constant ego gratification. In 
many ways, Cross embodies 
the film's complexities, and 
O'Toole handles them, and 
the part, with Insight and 
panache. 

Steve Railsback, as 
Cameron, is also very good. 
His is another complex part 
because Cameron is con- 
stantly questioning and 
redefining his surroundings. 
Railsback portrays this 
process with keen insight, 
and one can see the growth 
of his character as a result. 
Railsback has come a long 
way since his portrayal of 
Charles Manson. 

Barbara Hershey is ex- 
cellent, as Nina, the actress 
Cameron falls in love with. 
Her role could easily have 
been a satire of an ingenue, 
but Hershey's skilled per- 
formance makes it more 
than that. She is an actress 
who has been underrated far 
too long. 

"The Stunt Man" is my 
favorite film of the year.

Punk is junk 



Black Rose proves it 



By MICHELE DeVlNNEY 

It's hard to find words to 
describe the debul album by 
Black Rose, but inane, 
boring, and embarrassing 
come close. 

U new wave rock were the 
supreme music of our day. 
this is Ihe kind of garbage 
they'd play in elevators and 
dentists' offices. The "punk" 
spirit that inspired the i 
wave craze has been 
watered down to nothing on 
their self-tilled LP. 

The group does offer an 
interesting surprise: its lead 
singer is Cher. Therein lies 
the major problem. She's 
about as appropriate to lead 
this bunch as would be 
Sinatra or Streisand. 

By fronting a hard rock 
band, Cher's stepped en- 
tirely out of her musical and 
emotional depths. She's not 
bad; in fact, she's often quite 
good, within a rather limited 
pop field. 

Now she's gone far beyond 
those limits. Many of the 
eight songs on the album 
have her singing notes loo 
high (or her range, and the 
result Is thin and grating. 

She also appears to be 
trying too hard She 
manages a few token shouts, 
stutters and obscenities in a 



vain attempt to be 
temporary," but the effect is 
usually unintentionally 
funny. 

She's backed up by a band 
that probably deserves 
better. Most are ac- 
complished musicians, and 
their performances are 
tolerable if not vlrtuoslc; the 
music Is hardly complex 
jgh to challenge them In 
the least. 

The renl downfall Is the 
material. The songs are 
simplistic at best, and it's 
easy to predict the exact 
the drums will 
crash and (he guitar will 
wall. 

The lyrics are especially 
pathetic — what there is of 
them. For the mosl part. 
they consist of Cher 



screaming the title phrases 
and over ad nauseam 
tin "Young and Pretty" you 
think you'll gag if she sings 
"they say you can make it if 
you're young and you're 
prelty" one more lime), and 
the scanl verses are full of 
mindless sentiments tike 
"You're gonna give it up — 
you're gonna say 'all right'." 
It's sad that this album is 
such a failure since Ihe 
people involved are actually 
quile talented. The band, the 
studio musicians, including 
Steve Porcarro and David 
Paich of Toto, the 
songwriters, Bernie Taupin, 
David Foster, and others, 
and Cher arc all capable of 
much belter than they 
achieve here.

Think of a ship as a corpora- 
tion, and it's not farfetched at 
all. A destroyer may have 
fifteen officers, other ships 
even fewer. Even the most 
junior officer gets to share in 
running the show. 

You become part of the 
management team when you 
get your commission as an 
ensign after just 16 weeks of 
leadership training at Officer 
Candidate School. 

Choose to be a Navy officer 
and you are responsible for 
people and equipment almost 
immediately. 

Many officers go on for 
further advanced schooling. 
The Navy has literally dozens 
of fields for its officers— 



everything from nuclear pro- 
pulsion to systems analysis, 
oceanography to inventory 
management. In graduate 
school, this training would 
cost you thousands, but in 
the Navy, we pay you. 

Ask your Navy representa- 
tive about officer opportuni- 
ties, or mail this coupon for 
more information. Or call 
toll-free 800-841-8000 (in GA 
call toll-free 800-342-5855). 
There's no obligation, and 
you'll learn about an excellent 
way to start a career in 
management. As a college 
graduate you can get manage- 
ment experience in any indus- 
try. But you'll get it sooner— 
and more of it —in the Navy.

Spikers solid 
for state play 
this weekend 



By CHRIS PVLE 

"We will win." is a phrase 
Chat has implanted itself into 
the minds of the women on 
the volleyball team at 1PFW. 

Perhaps that phrase will 
be carried out as the team 
enters the state tourney. 

In the weeks past, the 
Tuskers faced hardships 
with game losses and in- 
juries. Now, all that is left 
behind Is a faded illusion of 
what once was. Things have 
taken a different turn. 
Injuries, suffered by team 
members, are healing. Only 
one player, Beth Christman. 
is still out of active par- 
ticipation. 

The Tuskers are "flred- 
up" and ready to go They 
are "red-hot" and proved so 
last week 

In a tourney hosted by St. 
Francis, the Tuskers 
defeated Marion, 2-15, IS 
12 and 15-10. The ball was 
tossed back and forth be- 
tween the two teams for 
three to four minutes, 
Finally, the spikers were 
able to slam the ball into 
Marlon territory and score. 
After this turning point, the 
game flowed in Tusker 
favor. 

Ranked third in their pool, 
the Tuskers played St, 
Mary in the St. Mary's 
invilationa). IPFW lost 
to St. Mary, 15-12, 8-15 
and 6-12. Thursday, the 
against Glen Oaks The 
spikers conquered them In 
the first two games, 15-2 and 
15-12, lost games three and 
four with scores of 10-15, 9- 
15, but thrust ahead to win 
the game and the match, 10- 
15, 'J- 15 and 15-6 

Saturday, the IPFW squad 
lost to Taylor, but beat 
Spring Arbor, last year's 
division III Michigan slate 
champs. 

"Winning," was the word 



as the spikers tangled with 
former rival Marion. IPFW 
won two out of three games 
and claimed the match, 3-15, 
15-8 and 15-7. , 

The spikers then shut out 
De Pauw, 15-0. This was the 
first shut-out for the team 
this season. The second 
game against DePauw 
appeared to be the exact 
opposite as the Tuskers 
trailed 0-13. But they were 
not willing to give up. Giving 
it their best shot, the spikers 
applied their best strategies, 
caught up and captured the 
game 15-13, and the match. 

What is all of this leading 
up to? The State Tourney. 
"We're fired up to defend the 
slate title. We are the 
defending state champs," 
said Volsln. She further 
remarked, "We're beginning 
to peak at the right time. 
Saturday, we felt like a 
winning team. Things 
started to come together." 

Building toward their 
ultimate goal, the team has 
worked on drill and 
motivational strategies. 
Best yet, the women are 
confident with themselves 
and with each other, They 
have instilled a "yes.wecai 
do il" attitude. 

Thursday. the IPFW 
squad will journey to 
Hanover, a five-hour drive 
from Fort Wayne. 

They will play Anderson 
on Friday afternoon at 1:30 
p.m. Then, at 3:30. they will 
seek revenge against St. 
Mary. 

The team has high hopes of 
continuing through the 
tourney. "We hope to be the 
first in the pool and play 
Saturday afternoon," said 
Voisin. But she warned, "It 
won't be easy. Come Friday, 
we're going to defend our 
title." 



•••in brief 

Women cagers need members 

The women's basketball team is having a tough time 
getting started this season, according to coaches Peggy 
Voisin and Bill Bruening. 

Voisin, who is currently concentrating on coaching the 
women's volleyball team through the state playoffs this 
weekend, said this week that only three girls have turned 
out for the practice sessions. Voisin expects another six 
players to join the team after the volleyball season ends. 

Bruening issued another call last week for any women 
students interested in playing basketball to find out more 
about the IPFW women's basketball program. 

Interested students should contact Bruening in the 
philosophy department or Voisin at the athletic office 
Also, the team will be practicing from 5:30-7 p.m., at 
Concordia gym, next week. 

B-ball scrimmage tomorrow 

The men's basketball team will be holding its final Red 
and Gold Scrimmage tomorrow afternoon at the Con- 
cordia gym. 

The Tuskers open their season next weekend when they 
play in the CedarviUe Tournament. 

Tomorrow's scrimmage is scheduled to start at 2:45 
p.m. Students, (acuity and staff are welcome to attend. 

V-ball practice tonight 

The first men's varsity volleyball practice will be held 
this evening at 8 p.m., at New Haven Junior High. Anyone 
interested in playing volleyball but unable to make the 
first practice should be sure to call coach Arnle Ball at his 
home, 632-5850. 

Intramural standings 

The Unexpected maintained their unbeaten record as 
they climbed to 6-0 in the intramural coed volleyball 
league. 

The United Flyers were only one game back from the 
leaders at 5-1 after five weeks of play. 

Other team records are: the Savage Spikers and The 
Sting, 4-2, The Greeks and the No Names, 3-3; DGTS 1, 
The Mutants, YPBC -Channel 14, the Aces and the Geology 
Club. 2-4; and DGTS 2. 1-5. 




By ROBERT R1NEARSON 

As the 2,100 runners fell 
into their starting positions 
for the third annual Lincoln 
10,000 Meter Run, there was 
little to think about except 
the run. Oh yes ... and the 
weather 

There seemed to be digits 
everywhere. In front of us 
was the digital starting 
clock To our right was a 
digital time and tem- 
perature clock which 
seemed stuck at 36 degrees. 

"It's cold as hell out here." 
When 1 looked around to see 
where the comment came 
from, I found a young boy, no 
older than 13 or 14. 

As I stood in the middle of 
the pack, I joined the chorus 
line of other runners who 
jumped up and down, doing 
various sorts of warm-ups to 
keep their muscles from 
lightening. Many eyes 
glanced skyward at the 
Ihreatending skies, won- 
dering if snow would in- 
terfere with the race. 

Suddenly, the gun sound- 
ed, the time clock started, 
and the pack forged ahead as 
the run began. With as many 
runners as there were, it 
would take those in the rear 
of the pack almost two 
minutes to everi reach the 
starting line. 

I'd participated in every 
past Lincoln run, so by now, 
I'd gotten it in my head that I 
should run it for time. This 
year, I hoped to break 40 
minutes, nowhere near the 
winning time, but respec- 
table enough for me. 

At the start of any race 
where 2000 runners are in- 
volved, everyone seems 
packed tighter than a can of 
sardines for the first mile or 
so. It's the nightmare of 



many a runner to have just 
one man or woman trip and 
presto, a mass pileup of 
entangled bodies results. But 
Sunday, the first mile went 
smoothly. 

Finally, the pack began to 
spread out on Forest Park 
Boulevard. As he ran past 
the finely trimmed lawns 
and beautiful houses, a 
runner could enjoy the 
sights, unless, of course, he 
or she allowed their at- 
tention to be focused on the 
run only. 

Past the halfway mark, 
the tfek continued on 
Columbia Street. Now, 
depending on the discipline 
of the runner's mind, 
willpower was severely 
tested by the pedestrians 
that lined the sidewalks or 
sat comfortably on front 
porch swings. 

Too many cans of cold 
beer and refreshments were 
held high, reminding the 
individual runner of the 
simple comforts he had 
chosen to avoid until the race 
was over. 

One runner broke down 
and accepted a can of beer. 
An overweight spectator 
jovially chuckled to himself, 
as if he found amusement 
that the runner could find 
solace in the observer's own 
weakness. 

Winding around onto Lake 
Ave. and past the four mile 
mark, the run became much 
more enduring. Sides ached 
increasingly due to the cold 
weather, while calves and 
thighs developed cramps, 
sending runners to the 
sidelines for relief. 

The spectators applauded 
and cheered, reminding the 
runners they hadn't much 



further to go. Many of the 
participants reached deep 
inside themselves for that 
second wind. 

At the five-mile mark, I 
was clocked at exactly 30 
minutes. Already the leader 
was finishing. 

In the home stretch along 
St. Joe Boulevard, I passed 
the runners who had yet to 
reach what I had already 
run. The emotions on their 
faces varied from in- 
difference to mental and 
physical pain. Vet of the 
runners who started the 
race, only 100 failed to finish. 

As I approached the finish 
line, I could see once again 
the large digital clock, 
ticking off seconds. On the 
grassy hill of Friemann 
Square, runners who had 
already finished stretched 
out on the cold ground. 
Others, aided by family and 
friends, slipped into their 
sweat clothes to avoid 
cramps. 

I felt instant relief as I 
crossed the finish line, 
noticing I'd achieved my 
goal of finishing under 40 
minutes. 

Considering the bone 
chilling weather, it was a 
remarkable day for the 
Lincoln 10,000. Dexter Leh- 
man, the winner, finished 
with a time of 30 minutes, 20 
seconds, almost 50 yards 
ahead of Tom Conners. 

Nine-year-old Mara 
Matuszak turned in an 
amazing performance to 
lead the women with a time 
39 :01 . Awards went to the top 
male and female finishers, 
the top three finishers in 
each age division, and to the 
oldest and youngest 
finishers.

Shortages cited 



By JIM CHAPMAN 

Having a winning 
season and reaching the 
NCAA Division III 
playoffs were two goals 
the IPFW men's soccer 
team had in mind at the 
beginning of the season. 

The Tuskers fell short 
of these goals, however, 
as they closed their 
season last week with a 5- 
1 loss to powerful Indiana 
Tech. The Tuskers 
finished with an B-8-I 
record and will not be 
going to the playoffs. 

"It was hard to end the 
season this way," coach 
Ed Stefankiewicz said 
after the Indiana Tech 
loss. "This team Is the 
best that I have had here 
at IPFW." 

"We had the od- 
portunities." Stefan 
kiewicz 
fleeting on the season. 
"We didn't take' a 
vantage of them, and 
think the players know 
that." 

There were two major 
problems with the team 
this year. Those con- 
tributed greatly to the 
Tuskers falling short of 
their goals. 

There were conflicts 
between class and 



practice times for 
members of the team. 
This constantly caused a 
shortage of men at each 
practice. The Tuskers 
held their practices with 
an average of nine or ten 
players at a session. 

"In order to win and be 
successful, we're going to 
have to change this," 
Stefankiewicz said. 

The Tusker offense also 
suffered from the lack of 
an all-important striker. 
A striker is a finisher ; the 
player who can con- 
sistently score goals. 

With a player like this, 
the Tuskers could 
possibly have put four of 
their one-goal losses in 
the win column. IPFW 
fell to Spring Arbor, 
Grace, Tri-State and 
Findlay by one goal in 
each game. 

"The defense and 
halfbacks were con- 
sistent," Stefankiewicz 
said. "The offense lacked 
that scoring punch. If we 
could get some good 
strikers, there is no 
telling what this team can 
do." 

Despite the absence of 
one consistent scorer, the 
Tuskers did roll up some 
very impressive scores. 



They defeated Bluffton 
College (Ohio) 3-0, 
Adrian, 10-1, Purdue 
Calumet, 2-0, and Hun- 
tington, 5-0. 

Stefankiewicz felt that 
his team's two best 
performances were 
victories over Man- 
chester, 5-1, and Hun- 
tington, 5-0. He also 
pointed out their two 
worst showings, losses to 
Tri-State, l-O, and St. 
Francis, 5-0. 

Stefankiewicz singled 
out forward Jim Sharpe, 
wing fullback Mark 
Gabrek and reserve 
goalie Mark Blessing as 
three who greatly im- 
proved over the 17 game 
schedule. 

Sophomore Tom 
Johnson led the IPFW 
scoring for the second 
year straight as he 
connected on 12 shots for 
goals. Co-captain Dave 
Husar and Sharpe each 
had five goals and five 
assists. James Hen- 
mueller also racked up 
five tallies. Tony Davis, 
who played in only four 
games after joining the 
team late, notched four 
scores, the last coming as 
the only IPFW goal in the 
Indiana Tech game.
