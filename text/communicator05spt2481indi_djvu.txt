Med center opens 



fBHOWN 
Stall Writer 

With the campletlon of BuUdingD, 
thp training d( dodon-io-bt at 
IPrwhaibecomc a reality 

Tlie MiMKHqu are-fool third floor 
of thai building hotis«i la Inratorla, 
liolallon roorm and complm 
medical equipment, all a part of the 
new Fort Wayne Center for Medical 

rranUIn Bryan ts heading up the 
bloisoming proHram as Its djreclor, 
and four medical etudenta are now 
taklnR clasiFS In Builifng D. The 
(lOgfflm Isthclrultlonorityearrof 
plannlngand waiting by Bryan. 

"In 1970. the state of Indioru faced 
B problem." Bryan said. "Not 
enough doctors were being trained 
lo serve our communities." The 
Indiana Statewide Medical 
Education Board had lo rcmeily this 
Bllualion as quickly aa possible. 



Instead of building a new me*cal 
school, which would cost mlllloiu of 
dollars and taite Tive yean in 
planning and coiulnictjon. the board 
opted to go with a de-cenlrallicd 
program of saleiile medical cent en. 

Seven sites were designated as 
coilerB. ail to be modeled alter (he 
Blocmlngton facility. Besides the 
Indianapolis hub, the centers in- 
clude the Northwest center at 
Gary's regional 1 U campis, Ihe 
Notre Dame campus at South Bend, 
Ihe Muncie culler fll Ball Stale, the 
West Lafayette center asjoclated 
with Purdue, Indiana State's center 
at Tcrr« Haute, the Evansvllle 
center, and the Fort Wayne center, 
Bryan said. 

"f^btems uith space and slaTI 
were the main reasons the Fort 
Wayne center has been the last to 
become a reality," Bryan said. 

Being last lo be completed does 



hai^ its advantages, however. 
Bryan said. All other centers were 
remodeled from existing facilities 
and sLaJled tiy existing personnel. 
The Fort Wayne center was 
designed before ground was broken 
for Building D and has the ad- 
vantage of choosing pcrvinncl to fit 
Ihe needs, he said. 

A nationwide search has brought 
to Fort Wayne the best men and 
women for the positions open. Bryan 
said. 

TTie maidmum capacity ol the 
program is 21) freshmen. 12 
sophomores and a few senior? and 
post-graduates students. Bryan 
views this as an advantage over the 
Indianapolis center, which has ISO 
fresh men students in Its program. 

Bryan said the maximum 
capadly of the center is eipected to 
be reached in the near future. 





Walb, Building D to receive sets 



Senate votes to buy TVs 



The Student Senate voted on Sept. 16 
to spend tt.seq on two televisions and 
delerredactlon to spend tSWon another 
television and magazines 

Senator Bruce Clark Introduced three 
bills. The bills were to allocate money 
to purchase new 21 -inch color television 
sets for Ihe Walb Memorial Union TV 
lounge, Ihe Building D lounge and Ihe 
Learning flesourceCenier ILRCI. 

In support of the lelevision for the 
Walb Memorial UnionTV lounge, Qark 
played a tape recording of a student's 
request for a new television and noted 
thai the cost ol repa iring Ihe present TV 
was prohibitive. 

Gark said the (1,1D0 [«lce tag for the 
new TV (or Ihe Walb Memorial Union 
TV lounge resulted from modifications 
necessary tn make it capable of 
receiving special cable T\' signals such 
as the one which presently broadcaslsa 



taught by the philosophy 
department. 

Ttie bill was passed unanimously, and 
Clark's second bill, to spend STBO to 
purchase a television for the building D 
lounge was passed with two negative 
voles and two ahatenlions. 

Clark's third bill, lo spend tTSO for a 
lelevision for the LRC, encounlered 
opposition Senator Sieve Wes trick 
said, "We have no business spending 
student money for academic depart- 
ments when they hove their own 
budgets. It is like buying a cadaver for 
the medical school." 

Senator Don Cuffey agreed, saying 
"They (LRCi are really well equipped. 
The system has worked well. ' 

Dark said the television was 
necessary and would serve as an 
educational aid lor all Ihe students. 
"The LRC purchased new equipment 



for building D, bul they need equipment 
so badly (hat It is already being used 
throughout Ihecam pus," Clark said 

Westrick attempted to amend the bUI 
to have the TV placed In the Keltier 
Hall lounge "This Is the students' 
money 1 think we should put it where 
Ihe students will uselt," WestricksBld. 

Senator Ron Dlchl disagreed, citing 
the desire to encourage students to 
come lo the Wolh Memorial Union. 
"Also, down at Kettler. those people are 
animals," Diehl said. "As far as 
pulling a brand new, cable-ready TV 
down there for Ihe animals to attack, 
lit) Is utterly senseless and waste of 

Diehl later added that wlih the 
present bill, the equipment would be 
available upon student request from the 
LRC. When Westrick asked Ditfil what 
would happen if one of the animals from 



Keltier requested the TV, Dlchl replied 
thai "Dr Ballhaser tdirector of the 
LRCi can recognlie an animal when he 

Westrlck's amendment was dcfealed, 
and the Senate voted to defer action on 
the bill until further information was 

Westrick then read a bill to spend 
(2S SO for the U S. Congressional 
Hordbook and the Washington Infor- 
mallon Directory to assist In the 
Senate's legislative affairs When 
Gulley asked Westrick whether he 
would forego (he purchase ol the 
magazines II the library had them, he 
replied that he would not go lo the 
library to use them. The expenditure 
was decided at (he Sept. 23 meeting. 

tn other business, Jennifer Sow-en 
was approved as an executive 
Bssl slant. • 



Chemical warfare ends Theatre students protest imposed ratios 



ByCAROLVN ROGERS WILBER 
Stall Writer 

No more chemical warfare on 
campus, Janet Averbcck said, 
referring lo the experiment In 
Uolo^cal control of gre«^ihai&amp;e insect 
pests she and James Haddock, 
ossodalc professor of bio io^ col 
sciences, began IB months ago 

Avcrbeck, an agrlcuKure- 
horllcullure major and manager of (he 
IPFW greenhouse for the past Iwo-and- 
a-half years, got (he idea for Ihe ex- 
periment from an article In Hor- 
ticulture magazine after Inking an 
enlomoiog&gt;' class with Haddock. 

Through the use ol parasites and 
predatory InsectB, control of 
greenhouse pests has been achieved 
without (he use ol chemical sprays for 
the last 14 months Avertccksaldthlsis 
encoura^ng proof that It cim be a 
viable and practical means to eliminate 
the costly and troublesome use of 
chemicals in (he greenhouse and will 
probiably lead to further research 

Harold Da vies, acting chairman of 
the IPFW biology department, who has 
been "more or less ui charge" of the 



greenhouse since its completion tn 19«. 
said the greenhouse is very adequately 
fulfilling its original purposes. Those 
purposes are lo provide a display of 
plants not native to this area and 
climale, (o supply primitive plant 
species for study materials, and to 
allow a place where students and 
faculty members may conduct ex- 
periments and research such as the one 
now in progress. 

In addition to the primitive plant 
species on display, which include a very 
large century plani, palms, end 
numerous varielles of ferns and suc- 
culents, visitors now would sec 
hibiscus, oleander, bougainvillaea, and 
begonias blooming in coloKul profusion 
against the lush greenery in the semi- 
tropical atmosphere ol the grecnhoiee 
along with a bird-of- para disc resting 
from recent flowering between several 
imposing stag-horn Icrns and banana 

Avcrback said she is pleased to show 
the greenboiBC, which Is located behind 
KetUer Hall, to Interested students or 
faculty. She may be contacted at the

SOI I Writer 

The meeting thai never was. 

That test describes what occurred 
Monday, Se pi H, in the PIT. where 21 
theatre majors gathered to meet with a 
Student Senate represent a live to 
discuss a lillie known resolution passed 
by the Senate last April. 

The meeting was organized so that 
the Senate could learn the students' 
feelings about Resolution BaiS2, 
Initialed by representatives Steve 
Westrick and Suiy Scare, which 
stipulates that each PIT production be 
cast with at least 70 percent students. If 
the Senate decides to enforce the 
resolution, which is still under 
disciEsion, tbey would do so by making 
II a condillon of monetary allocations to 
the theatre department in their annual 
budget meeting. 

A previous ruling, passed by the 



Senate In April, 1979, renuired a S5 
percent overall representation by 
students tn PIT productions. The ruling 
Included both onstage and backstage 
participation 

T^e Senate representative did not 
attend the Monday meeUng. However, 
the students present clearly voiced 
their opposition to any increase in 
student ratios in PIT casts. 

The meeting was arranged by 
Jeffrey Huberman, theatre department 
chairman, when he was unable Lo keep 
an appointment with Scare and 
Westrick to discuss the resolution. He 
felt a discussion a tMUI it should Include 
theatre .students since they would be 
directly affected. 

Scare and Westrick decided not to 
attend the meeting, saying they had 
planned to mecl with students after 
they met with Huberman 

Students who attended the meeting 
were unanimously against any increase 



in studenl casting ratios. They 
repeatedly expressed the fear that 
productions would suffer in quality aso 
result of Increasing student ralioa in 
casting. 

The students contend onstage ex- 
perience is gained through In-class 
productions and that to rasle per- 
centages of students in all PIT casting 
would artiricially reduce competillon 
by assuring parts lo Individuals 
regardless of taJenl or capabiillles. 

Scare contends however, that PIT is 
supposed to teach students about 
theatre and give (hem practtca! ex- 
perience on stage Sbe claims other 
universities, such as Butler, use 
students to make up their casts, not 
outsiders, and that IPFW students 
aren't fully aware of the possibQIties 
and advantages of all-student 
productions 

After the resolution was passed by 
the Scnalc, a poll was taken by Ho I den 



New minister begins duties at IPFW 



Honors program considered 



By JEFF SANDY 
SlBff Writer 

Establishment of an honors program 
and distribution of faculty of Hce space 
were the main topics of discission when 
Ihe IPFW Joint Faculty Senate met 
Sepl. H 

Rudy Svoboda, associate professor of 
raatheraabca, recommended ac- 
ceptance of Ihe honors prc^ram 
proposal, which consists of special 
courses devoted lo developing Ihe 
potential of gifted stuilents. Svoboda 
said the cour^ework should be modiried 
lo Include Ihe associate degree !e\'el 
and to have some courses satisfy 
general educa tion requiremen ts . 

Lowell Belneke, professor 
mathematics, said the proposed ooe- 
lourth course load reduction for the 
faculty member serving as prc^ram 
admmistnilor tie removed. Michael 
Downs, associate profissor of political 
sdence. suggested that instead of Ihe 
course load reduction that additional 

since "reducUoG of houis often 
removes effective professors" from the 
classroom. 

Arthur Fnedel.assodale professor of 
chemiitry, questiooed whether Ihe 
program would increase bureaucracy 
in the course Bprroval process. 
Svoboda said that going through Ihe 
honors couDcll wis only necosary for 
courses to be approved as botwn 

Also In the meetbig, James ToboEski, 
usoclate prolessor id bloIogicBl 
sdolces, rtported on the progress of 
the rc-allocaUMi ol otiice spice for 
faculty membert. He said although (he 



iniiial objective was to provide a 
private omce for each full-time faculty 
member, the addition of 21 faculty 
members In Ihe sprmg made that ob- 
jective impossible to implement 

Edward A. Nicholson, vice- 
chancellor lor academic affairs, said 
the committee Tobolski headed tiad 

would "probably get flak and no 
thanks" for lis Job. He also said starting 
Oct. IS, the Arts and Letters faculty 
would begin Its move into Building D, 
followed in late October by tbe music 
department. 
In olher business i 

— Chancellor Joseph P. Giusti 
reported that (heBoard of Advisors had 
met and recommeoded lite transfer of 
the license of \V1PU lo Public Broad- 
casting of Northeastern Indiana 
IPBNIJ.

mathematic education and Purdue 
senate speaker, reported that work was 
progressing on tic formulallon of a

— David McCanls. professor in

communication, repined that a 
second drsfl ol the bylaws for the jfiini 
faculty senate was beuig completed. 

— Chancellor Giusti annomced that a 
budget information meeting would be 
held on Sept. 10. John R. Camaghl, 
vice-chancellor for financial affairs, 
said the purpose ol thai meeting was 
"to inform the faculty of gross budget 
ixaas such as comparing various 
departmoital budgets."

HPER building to gain 'A' parking 



By GRETCHE.N 
HOLODICK 
Stall Writer 

■n^ jDint Tramc and ParUng 
Committee met recently, and one topic 
tbey discussed was a request by Jctm 
Ulmer. dean of stiulenl services, to 
change the row of spaces nearest the 
new HPER builtSng from "B" to "A" 
parking. 

"It was decided." said John F. 
Rosencras, assistant professor of 
mechanicai engineering (edinology 
and bead ol the traHic comimtlee. 
"that since a number of faculty 
moving oul of Kettio' 



Hall over lo (he new HPER building, 
the "A" lot over oo the south side of 
Kettler will be changed to "B" so there 
will not be any loss of parting spaces to 
"B" slicker holders." 

"A" stickers are only available for 
faculty and staff members at a cost of 
ttO. whereas "B" stickers are offered 
to anyone and cost tS, said Maurice 
Shady, captain of the universitj- police. 
■There are 2,813 parking spaces at this 
time — 174 "A" spaces, 173 meters. 28 
hani£capped spaces, and (be rest are 
■B" spaces," 3iady said. 

"The basic philosophy behind this 
request," Ulmer said, "is that every 



building should have sisne "A" parking 
spaces. "A" stickers cost more than 
"B" stickers, so thb denotes certain 
privileges," be added. 

"TTie reason the "A" parking wilt be 
so close to the HPER building is 
becaiEe the staff and teachers need to 
have ready access to come and leave 
the buiiifing, " Ulmer said. 

"Tbe parking situadon is bad." 
Ulmer continued, "but Last year we had 
an excess of ipaca over by the 
basketball courts. This is a long way to 
walk, bul Oitre just isn't tbe funds to 
put in new paiiing ar«as if it Isn't 
absolutely necessary.' '

Resolution "D," wliich many senators tout 
OS the answer to the special election problem, 
was introduced after the fact This resolution 
IS an example of ex post facto legislation, 
which, we should all rememberfrom our hi^ 
school history comes, is illegal in the United 
States 

One final point: l^st Apnl 17. a meeting 
was held in [Jean Ulmer's office. Among ihiKe 
prcsoil were Dean Ulmor, out-going 
president Arm Momper, in-coming president 
Ken Schenk and Senate parlln men tartan Jeff 
Sandy. At this meeting, il was decided by all 
present thai. Indeed, there would be a special 
election this fall 

TheCommunlcator then asks: Where is It? 



Senators write 



Some members of the Student Senote have 
written The Communicator this post week to 
voice their dispicaiiurc wtlh the way we hnve 
been "caifllnR divislvcness and propogan- 
diilng" and "otherwise Intimidating Ihe 
Senate." These wrilers urge us to "present a

Li shouting al 



to be on easy target. This paper has of- 
ten praised the Senate. For example, in Ihe 
April IS Issue, an editorial enumerated the 
achievements of both the Senate and SUBOG 
at Ihe close of Ann Mompcr's term of office as 
sludenl tndy presidenL 

At that lime the Senate had conducted 
campaigns In opposition lo higher tuition 
rates and the proposed "late" calendar, and 
also gave support to the four-year 
engineering program. SUBOG had also ex- 
panded Its activities with the addition ot an 
annual spring break trip to Florida and an 
annual ikl trip. 

Students' Government can be, and often is. 
a Vila] and active organization The Com- 
munlcalor asks it to continue to live up lo its 
stationary and be "a government scrvingand 
protecting thcstuden Is." 



concens over tite ai 
ot Student Senate, t feel 
compelled to point out 
sevo'al tiiases which have 
led not only to inaccuracies, 
tut also to an unproductive 
i mage of (he Studen t Sena te 
First, regarding the letter 
to the editor of Sept. 17. 
senator Clark implies that 
student body presidoit Ken 
Schenk Is ptBhing for higher 
activity fees. In fad. 
president Schenk was 
merely tnlroducing the idea 

Incidently, included the 
towertng of full-time activity 
fees to SIS. He is not trying to 
gel the Senate to "spend as 
much money as they can on 
activities he wants" When 
senator Clark enumei-ated 
some recent Students' 
Govemmenl expenditures, 
he failed to mention his own 
tegi slot ton. in which he has 
proposed the expenditure ol 
some 17,300 for items he feds 
are worth spending students' 
money on Mr. Clark asks 
"where does Schenk get the 
Idea thai we want these 
activities?" The answer, of 
course, is that he thinks wc 
want them because SUBOG 
or IheSenate voted for Ihem. 
Mr. Gark would have been 
free to vDlcehis views during 
their meetings rather than 
attack Mr, Schenk lor the 
outcome. 

Second, regarding the 
proposed special election. 
The Communicator has 
falsely propagated Ihe 
opinion that the Senate has 
superceded its constitution 
in nullifying the 

parliamentarian's dec- 
laration requesting a 
special election. Before such 
a Judgment eon be made, II 
Is neceuary to look al Ihe 
intent of that section of the 



questioned. Qewty. the 
special eledion clause was 
Inloided to till vacated 
seals, not lo subject new 
petitioners to an election. 
The Senate has already 
ulved this questica irith the 
passage of Resolution D. 
nullifying the oeed for a 
sfcdai election. Tbt con- 
tinued insistence by Tbe 
Communicator that the 
Senate is "illegltlinate'" only 
series to drag Ihai body's 
unage ttirough the mix] in 
the eyes of the students vfao 
are subjected only to the 
propaganda of The Com- 
municalor 

Already, many students 
feel that the Senate is a 
loelessbody. bogged down in 
political red tape However, 
the (rollferallon of personal 
attacks and one-sided 
reporting are l)&gt;e causldve 
forces of tills Impasse, i 
appeal to The Communicator 
to present a more t&gt;alBiiced 
view of Students' Govern- 
ment issues, rather than 
using their own personal 
interpretations as the basis 
of their reporting. To those 
parties Involved in causing 
divisiveness. propagan- 
dizing, and otherwise in- 
timidating Students' 
Government. I urge for a 
more constructive unity that 
can lead to positive ac- 
complishment by IheSenate, 
Although Student Senate has 
a reputation of tieing un- 
productive, few students 
realize the Importance of 
what can. Is, and should be 
accomplished by a body of 
representatives acting in the 
interests of students, 
protecting (heir rights, and 
continuing to promote ac- 
tivities to (heir benefit,

Student Senator 



Letter to the editor 



Dear Editor: 

The Student Senate has 
again succeeded In leaving 
me stunned and appalled. 
After hearing ol Sept. I's 
session, I con clearly un- 
derstand why (he Senate 
receli'cs luch poor student 
participation. Time is much 
too precious to waste on 
farcical absurdities. 

Time and time again, the 
Senate has Informally issued 
complaints that par- 
licipallon Is low, and falling. 
After the resolution in- 
iToduced by Steven Weslrick 
at ihc first fall meeUng, this 
Is quite understandable. As 
the governing bodyof IPFW, 
the Senate has o respon- 
siblUly to conduct their 
aflatrs in (he most fair and 
democratic way ] find it 
cilrcmely revolting thai Mr. 
Weslrick would favor Tilling 
Ihe vacancies In the Senote 
without a special election, 
and even more shocking that 
the Senate would choose to 
meet In secret — away from 



appointed dictators, out of 
(ouch with the Ideals of the 
people who put them In ol' 
(lcc7 

One question Is long- 
standing In my mind. Why Is 
Mr WcstrIck so fearful of a 
special election? Is he 
tearful of democracy? How 
quickly one forgets the 
duties and res pons ibiii lies of 
oirice — proving again the 
emptiness ol words and Ihe 
hollowncss of promises. 
Perhaps his Ideas and 
positions should be carefully 
examined and reviewed. A 
student senator should not be 
pursuing his or her own 
personal whims and quirks, 
but should be representing 
the people he or she was 
elected to serve. It Is a 
shomc the dark, back-room 
politics of Washington are so 
rooted In our very com- 
munity.

By STEVE RIEGEI. 

Art) Editor 

TTirough lUi last few 

Prcibytcrlan Tbeoler has 
esliiblllhed a tradlllon of 
bringing significant drama 
lo the itage, lucccssfully 
producing clastlcal playi, 
such as Sophocles's 
"Antigone," as well as 

moilcrpleces like ' Ibsen's 
"Ctoits." 

Tills Iradlllon Is conilnued 
In the new season with the 
currcn L produc Hon of George 
Bernard Shaw's ' 'Candida . " 

"Candida" is a brilliantly 
written, witty, Funny play, 
oalenslhly about the con- 
flict between a preacher and 
a poet tn love with the same 
woman However, ihc Im- 
pllcallons ol this conHlct are 
much broader as a tension 
dcvcl(qM between social and 
romantic Idealism llie play 
also explores, on s less 
extUIcd level, the Itisues of 
capilDlIsm and socialism, as 
well as ttw powers and 
feelings of women. 

9iaw's play Is full of 
subtlelica not lost in this 
production. Director John 
Tolley Insures Ihat erery 
nuance li reflected In the 
chore cl era' actions and 
expressions. 

The Reverend James 
Morell, played by Gregory 
Muntrold. Is a social refor- 
mer who suffen under 
Ulusions of his own moral 
ilrcngth and his mastery of 
his wife, Cnndida As (he 
ploy progresses, he is 



gradually stripped of his 
llluslom. Manifold portrays 
these changes of character 
very well. 

David Yamelle, as the 
poet Eugene, capably 
handles one of the mosl 
difficult roles in Iho play. He 
must express a delicate 
sensitivity and outward 
weakness combined with the 
inner strength of the artist 
who fully comprehends the 
thoughts and fecilnss of 
those around him. Yor- 
neltc's performance seems 
overly melodramatic at 
first, but as his eharacicr 
gains in conHdence, so does 
Ids acting 

The strongest characters 



the play . 
is Canada's IMoliy McCrmy) 
pragmatic realism thai 
holds all of the ploy's con- 

taiance. McCray gives her 
Candida the assurance of a 
woman who knows her 

The most winning per- 
formance of the show is 
Suiie Weaver's Miss Prossy. 
Morell's prim and proper 
secretary. Weaver Is 
especially brilliant In the 
scene when Eugene 
challenges Prossy with her 
own feelings.
