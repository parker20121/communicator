On Oct. 29, the IPFW Alumni 
Association hosted ttie annual 
Legislative Issues Luncheon. IPFW stu- 
dents, faculty, staff and alumni were able 
to sit down and discuss Ihe issues wilh 
local Icgislalois over lunch. 

The main issue that (vas proposed 
by the speakers at the luncheon was the 
same as last year, equity funding. What 
is equity funding? Equity funding is the 
distribution oF state funds according to 
enrollment. 

IPFW is continually at or near Ihe 
bottom ivhcn it comes lo distribution ol 
funds. IPFW ranks fifth in enrollment 
among Indiana universities, but ranks 
" of funding per 



fuil-ti 



. (See char 



ing," Shoda added.

Association.) 

What exactly does that mean For 
courltsy jpfyj students? [( IPFW could get equi- 
iirtJi's ly funding, the school would be able to 

do mote. Several campus projects have 

been postponed due to lack o( funding. 



Dorm construction is one such 
example oF what Ihe additional funding 
could help accompluih. According to 
Student Body Vice President ol 
Legislation Malt Shilling, "Sludenl 
housing would be the ne^t step in mov- 
ing IPFVV to the next level." V\Tial about 
a music and performing arts building or 
even another parking garage? 

There are many campus improve- 
ments that could be made with the edra 
funding. These all have been shelved for 
the time being, however, since the 
money has not been made available. 

Without the equity funding, il 
becomes more difficult for IPFW to 
grow. Brent Wake, IPFW student body 
vice president of finance, summed up 
Ihe argument by saying, "We can not 
and will not become the university that 
Northeastern Indiana should have, and 
needs, if we arc not evermore embraced 
and supported by Ihe city that we repre- 
sent and the state that we serve." 

Students can help secure these 
funds by lobbying their stale representa- 
tives for equity funding.

ssues that they believe most 
mpact the student body, 

"" ■ 5 that 



dents discussed was a feeling 
thai some of the advisers failed 
to take student concerns serious- 
ly. The general consensus that 
came from Ihcstudents was that 
Ihe importance of advising 
should be stressed more, partic- 



addressed at the luncheon 
the ever-present student park- 
ing problem. More specifically 
addressed was the paving of the 
"temporary" parking Tot by 
issue that Is Kclller Half. The student senate 
for students until passed a resolution lost semester 
to pave this lot; however, the 
issue is now in debate in the fac- 
ulty senate. 

The faculty senate wants to 
completely remove this parking 
lot. This would eliminate the 
potential for several hundred 
parking spots that ore desper- 
many of the students present alely needed, 
was that Ihev were unaware of Students who have ques- 

who their advisers were, either tions about their adviser or

advising is often an issue that ii 

a problem is experienced 

One example involves 
courses that are only offered 
during particular semesters, 
therefore prolonging a student's 
educational career if he is not 
aware of this Khedule.

Holly Near does not just 
lecture and sing about peace, she 
practices it in her life every day. 
Near brought her message ol 
peace and tolerance to IPFVV last 
Saturday at a sold-out benefit 
concert for the Center for 
Nonviolence, and again at a lec- 
ture that she presented on 
Monday. 

A diverse group of .ibout 
100 people including children 
and senior citizens, attended 
Near's lecture. Near touched on 
many subjects during tile two- 
hour presentation including vio- 
lence in the United States, social 
activism, critical thinking and 
Sept. II. 

Near began her career as an 
actress shortly alter graduating 




Singer/activist Holly Near 



From UCLA. She appeared in 
IS television snows and 
and began recording 
sic when she realized 
was not comfortable 



working within the 'industry,' 
■There were only two sleico- 
types for female singers at Ihe 
time: a hopeless wai^ or a red- 
hot mama, ' according lo Near. 

She eventually decided to 
form her own recordmg label so 
that she could distribute her 
music and its messages of toler- 
ance and peace. Near h.is since 
made over 20 recordings, and 
regularly tours the worlcT bring- 
mg her music loa variety of cultuns. 

Near also focused on the 
issues oF leai and peace during 
her lecture on Monday. She 
encouraged people to examine 
theii feelings of fear and racism 
and explore their origins so that 
they might understand them 
and deal with them appropnale- 



way ol people loving each other. 
We are living in a society addict- 
ed to violence and hostile behav- 
ior," Near said. She added that il 
is important for people to, "cre- 
ate opportunities to help people 
Set rid of their fear." One can do 
)i5 by allowing Ihem to openly 
discuss any racist or hateful 
thoughts or ideas that they may 
have without passing judgment 
on them or condemning them 
For their feelings. 

Near said that it has taken 
her many years lo get to the 
point of learning to, "take 
other's rage as a gift and learn 
from it," rather than reading to it. 
She concluded by staling 
that everyone should try to lead 
by example and do one small.

about our government and its 
policy makers. At Ihe end of the 
rally, a man walked up lo Ihe 
microphone and began speak- 
ing. "1 am a Vietnam veteran," 
he said. There rallying and walk- 
ing in a peace marcTi was one 
who had lived war. He had not 
only lived through combat with 
all its horror and atrodtics, he 
had also come home to a country 
thai greeted him with hale 
rather Ihan honor, "I hope thai if 
vm go lo war, those veterans 
who return home arc nol treated 
like we were Ireated when we 
returned from Vietnam. " he said. 

On Veteran's Day. let us 
remember and honor all of our 
velcrans. All ol those who 
served our country. Those who 
lived, Ihose who died. Those 
who foueht lo defend Ihe safely 
and ideals of their country. 'Vie 
arc a nalion made up of a 
diverse group of people from 
many ethnic backgrounds. Let 
us remember our history on 
Veteran's Day. 

Il is my hope that we 
remember and honor those vet- 
erans who have been forgotten 
by their country and by their 
people. The Native Americarxs, 
and Ihe African Americans, who 
have always fought and served 
our nalion during wartime, ycl 
Ihcir plight is forgotten when 
Ihey return home to poverty. 

The Vietnam-era veteraiu 
who were greeled with anger 
and hostility when Ihey returned 
home from war. The men and 
women who still suffer from 
post traumatic stress disorder. 

ing homes ar\d those who are 
receiving substandard care in 
veteran's hospitals around the 
country, 

Ul's remember Ihe Gulf 
War veterans suffering from 
Cull War Syndrome, which our 
government refuses to name, or 
acknowledge as real and legiti- 
mate, yet they suffer from chron- 
ic pain and debilitating illness 
every day of their lives. 

Let us remember that our 
military should fight not only lo 
protect our nation from clear 
and imminent threat, bul also lor 
the ideals thai our nalion was 
founded upon. The Conslilulion 
of the United Slates and Ihe Bill 
of liights both define rights that 
should be given freely, without 

Grcjudice to all the citizens of the 
nited States of America, 
regardless of race, creed, color or 
gender. We are the people 



president who was not elected 
by Ihe people — a president who 
is breakmg new ground by 
allcmpting to rally a nalion in 
favor of a preemptive war, based 
uponpossible fulurc thrcat- 

Tlierc are ahvays casualties 
and loss of human life during 
war, and those who sun'ive, Ihe 
civilians and the veterans, live 
the n.'sl of their lives wilh the 



memories and Ihe scars. War 
should never be entered into 
lightly without thought, without 
efforls to find peaceful resolu- 
lions and definitely nol without 
Ihe suj ■ ■ ■' 
Ihcir al 

We now live not only under 
our own laws, but under Ihe 
laws of the United Nations. As a 
counlry, we enpecl other nations 
to adhere to U.N. rules and sanc- 
tions, yet our government wants 
lo act alone. Who is saoificed? 
We the people, our brothers and 
sisters, our sons and daughters! 

My son is 19, all of his 
friends are of legal drafting age. 
Some of them are already serv- 
ing in Ihe armed forces, others 
have iusi enlisted, I am certain 
that it Ihe draft is instated. I will 
lell my son to cnlisi before he is 
drafted. He is sensitive and inlel- 
ligent. The recruiters have been 
aUcr him since high school. 1 
raised him lo think for himself, 
to have compassion and lo find 
peaceful resolutions to conflict. 

This philosophy has been 
very difficult for him, and has 
caused him both distress and 
growth. He has never been in a 
light, and has used his voice and 
reason in difficult silualioru. He 
has also chosen to walk away 
from fiehls, I believe that il 
would destroy my son to kill. 
The option is lo become a con- 
tentious objector. 

Last year 1 read a book by 
William Stafford, who was a 
CO. during WWII. He was for- 
ever marked by the experience, 
and his writings show the 
imprint. Il is often the C.Cs who 
serve as medics. They are nol 
enempt from front line duly — 
Ihey are the ones wearing Ihe 
red cross, the first ones Ihe oppo- 
sition shoots for. Take oul the 
medic, you take oul Ihe help. 
Regardless of how we. each as 
individuals, choose to serve our 
counlry, either by fighting in the 
armed forces or by fighting for 
peace, we all deserve tionor for 
standing lor out ideals. 

Whether we agree with the 



effort

serve in Ihe armea forces. 
Personally, 1 would like to take 
this opportunity lo give my 
deepest sense of honor lo all 
those who have sacrificed and 
served our counlry. To Ihe vclcr- 
aiw, 1 bow to you in honor. I 
hope that we have learned from

Staff Coltimnisis 

Mars Asks: I love television 
and there's nothing that I love 
more than to laugji, so it only 
makes sense thai 1 would love 
that crazy television genre Ihey 
call Ihe -sitcom." And I do. 

However, ever since I was 
just a young pup, there was a 
trend lliat I noticed in many of 
these shows that just drives me 
crazy, tnevery single sitcom that 
features a family, the dad is a big 
goof. All of them. The father is 
always the bull of all of the jokes, 
is rarely right, is constantly sec- 
ond guessed and basically is a 
big kid. 

Even if the sitcom father is 
Ihe star ol the show, this still 
holds true. "The Cosby Show" is 
a great example of this. Even 
though Heathcliff Huxlable was 
a loving father and a successful 
doctor, his wife ran the house! 
Cliff, along wilh every other sit- 
com father, has lost every argu- 
ment he ever engaged in with his 
wife! I dare you to try lo name a 
sitcom m which the lather has it 
all logether and constantly has lo 
set his wife "slraighl!" 

So what I want lo know U 
why can't silcom daddies gel no 
love? What does this say about 



men? Is this how fathers are 
actually perceived? Until this 
trend slops, I am boycotting all 
sitcoms — well, eicepi for "The 
Cosby Show." And "Growing 
Pains" is prclly good, loo. Oh. 
and I love thai one wilh Urkel! 
Maybe I just won't watch Ihem 
as much' 

Venus Responds: Okay, so 
there may be some truth behind 
what you're saying, and I agree 
that maybe Ihese sitcom daddies 
do need some more lovin', but 
get over il! If you think about it 
— look how the men are being 
portrayed compared to the 
women. White on the one hand. 
Ihe men are classified as laid- 
back and fun-loving, women are 
looked upon as control-frcak- 
naggcrs! Ick! No wonder no one 
wants to be married these days! 

If Ihe typical family is simi' 
lar to that of 'Yes, Dear" or 
"Everybody Loves Raymond," 
then what a crazy life lies ahead! 
But 1 doubt that your dad is as 
furuiy as Raymond, or even thai 
your mom puis up with as much 
stuff as Mrs. Huxlable did in her 

a show that depic 
cal family? Oh, I i 
now: Ihe middle class famiTy bat- 
tling il out over what social 
extravaganza Ihey should par- 




lake in this weekend, while Iheir 
three bratly children bicker over 
who gets to drive Ihe new 
Mustang to school! The parents 
hardly know each olher, let alone 
Iheir children. 

The children are all fighting 
(or their parents' attention by 
being rebellious and vicious. All 
Ihe while Iheir eight lelevisions 



i?' 



episode of eitner "Family 
Mailers" or "Growing P^ns, 
and Ihe kids are wishing mote 
than anything the it parents were 
like Ihe ones on tetevLsion. 

Bottom line: It's television! 
It's nol realily. Just enjoy your 
old -school shows! 



Inside scoop about how the snipers were captured 



This story is nol about 
Afghanistan, Iraq. VValergale, 
travel-gale, file-gale or scandal- 

who are pissed because Ihey 
can't all be football coaches in 
the NCAA or Ihe NPL. And it's 
nol about homosexuals coming 
oul of the closet. 

It's an exciting true story 
about an American hero. 
Probably about an alhlelc or 
movie star then you quickly pre- 
sume? NOT! 

This is about a 61-year-old 
trucker named Ron Lantz, from 
Ludlow. Ky. 

Laniz was making one of 
his bi-weekly rur\s oul to 
Wilmington, Del. in his 18- 
wheelcr, listening to the Truckin' 
Bo;to radio show on WLW-AM 
oul of Cinciimali around II p.m. 
when he heard a description of 
Ihe snipers vehicle; "a 1990 blue 
Chevy Caprice wilh a New 
Jeisey plate" the announcer 
identified as the vehicle to be on 
the lookout for. 

Around 1 a.m.. Uantz eased 
his big-rig inio a rest area in 
Frederick, Md. just off of 1-70 lo 
use the reslroom as he always 



The week before the 
snipers were caplurcd (Nolice I 
said snipers — I've always 
wondered how s "-- - 



did on this particular run. As he 

was pulling in, Lantz noticed a 

blue Chevy Caprice parked 

there. He saw a man resting on 

the steering wheel as if asleep, caught red handed is still called 

and another man slanding oul- a suspecl. Back to what I was 

s Linlz saying before this easily sidc- 

lo him- tracked writer was once again 

sidetracked.), Lantz was mak*

side the car. As si

Quickly, Lanlz dialed 911 upon himself lo pi 

and explained the siluation. The One True Cod in He, 

dispatcher inslruclcd Lanlz and Ihal Ihese evildoers 

another trucker lo use their rigs caplured, and that he shi 

to block the exit back onlo the invite others to join hii

aware of Ihe rest of the story 
because it wasn't politically correct. 



keyed up the microphc 
his CB radio and began asking 
other truckers lo join him in an 
unrehearsed prayer at the 
weigh-stalion a few miles

As the drivers cased their 
rigs into the weigh station, the 
scale-master heard what was 
going on and promptly closed 
the scale for business and 
joined in inviting drivers lojoin 
in for the prayer that Ihe 
snipers would be arrcsled. 

Within a few minutes, the 
weigh slalion was full of 
trucks, so the trucks still 
pulling in began lo park on the 
shoulders on both sides of the 
highway. 

The truckers then made a 
big circle and joined together in 
prayer to God Ihal this terror 
would quickly come to an end. 
Ron estimated that belween 
150-200 drivers were in Ihat 
prayer circle and Ihal trucks 
were parked bumpcr-to- 
bumper for al least Iwo miles 
on the shoulders coming from 
both directions. 

As you now know. Ron 
Lantz was the man who made 
Ihat 911 call exactly one week 
laler lo report a suspicious 
looking blue Chevy Caprice 
Ihat contained the sleeping 
John Allen Muhammed (42) 
and John Lee Malvo (17).

Janri Master Jay RIP perdue receives learning award 



Alone wilh Joseph Simmons 
and Darrvl McDaniels. a man by Ihi" 
name o( (ason Mizell icvolulioni/ed 
music. Nol just the kind of music 
that he performed, he revolulionized 
.ill music. He helped make rack, rap, 
R&amp;B and every sound in between. 

Miiell, belter known to the 
world as Jam Master lay, was Ihe DI 
for Ihe hip-hop conglomerate Run 
DMC. Come the afternoon o( 
Tliursday. Oct. 31. J was still uncer. 
tain about whal I would wrile about 
this week, I had hoped lo complete 
one of Ihe interviews t had Imed up 
lo start my new interview column. 

Bui when I heard of Ihe sense- 
less murder of this music mogul. 1 
had my story. Sure maybe hip-hop 
isn'l your Ihine; it's not really mine. 
I have several rap CDs from that 
stage of my life, and even a handful 
Ihal I slill listen loo. Run DMC is not 
one of my favorite groups. I don't 
own any of Iheir albums. But 1 
respect whal Jam Master Jav did for 
the music industry. He made it pos- 
sible for everyone to make music. 

In 1982, at the age of 17, Mi/ell 
started Run DMC with his Iwo high 
scliool friends. Before long, Ihey had 
turned Ihe world upside down. 
After the success ol their debul sir&gt;- 
gles "ll's Like Thai" and "Sucker 
MC's," the groups debut album 
wcnl gold in 1984. VVhal's so special 
about 500,000 copies sold? No rap 
group or artist had ever done thai 
before Run DMC. It had begun — 
Run DMC h,idslarted the hip-hop and 
rap revolution. 

From P. Diddy lo Tupac to 
Eminem. Ihey all owe a good por- 
tion of their success to Run DMC. 
Sure, any fan, critic and/or artist can 
argue that someone eventually 
would have opened the doors thai 
Run DMC did. but how do you 
know for sure. 

For all we know, if it wasn't for 
Run DMC. wc could have no rap 
music. So you thmk that's not a bad 
thing? Well, without rap, half of Ihe 
music of today wouldn't fiavc Ihe 
same rhythm and style. If it wasn't 
for Ihe early rap pioneers like Run 
DMC, no song would have as good 




And I am almost certain that 
many of Ihe people reading this 
don't see a bad side of not having 
rap. But, what about the doors that 
opened in 1986 when Run DMC 
made what would end up being the 
biggest collaboration to dale in Ihe 
music industry? It was in thai year 
that Run. DMC and Jam Master Jay 
released a single called "Walk This 
Way" featuring this band that you 
may have heard of called Aerosmith. 
Already an established hil-making 
machine, Aerosmith was run every 
which way about their decision to 
work with a rap group. It was with 
this hit thai Run DMC began lo take 
rap and hip-hop off the street and 
move it into suburbia. 

Jusl like they had done in 1984, 
Run DMC paved Ihe way for music. 
From 1987 on. the genre now known 
as rap/rock progressed into one of 
Ihe highest selling genres ever. 
Especially in Ihe late '90s, it became 
obvious that what Run DMC had 
done by featuring Aerosmith was 
truly ama;!ing. Xvould there be 
bands like Kom, Limp Biz kit, Linkin 
Park or Puddle of Mudd wilhoul 
that I9B7 track? Probably, but would 
Ihey have the same sound and/or 
effect that they do notv? 1 doubt it. 
Jam Master Jay " ----- ■ ■ 






oil ' 






rap/rock, modem punk, dirty pop. 
rap, hip-hop, R&amp;B and even modem 
rock can all attribute a portion of 
Iheir sound lo Run DMC and Jam 
Masler Jay. 

Recently, several people, critics 
and common folks alike, nave been 
outraged by the comparisons 
between Jam Master Jay and John 
Lennon in the last week. And I 
agree, there is no comparison 
because it's like comparing night 
and day. Not to say that either con- 
tributed more, but Ihey contributed 
differently. 

Sure, when you ask most artists

WEST LAFAVFTTE, Ind, 

Univeraily's Kranriert School ol

Eiccllence in Distance Education from Ihe 
Indiana Distance Learning Association. 

The award was presented Thursday 
[to/31) at Ihe statcdistance learning associ-

Chas DeLa (pronounced de-LAH). the

outfitting Ihe school's distance learning 
classroom. The room, located in the 
Krannert Center, is used regularlv to send 
real-lime West Lafayette-based MSA classes 
to the German International School of 
Management and Administration (GISMA) 
in Hanover. Germany, 

"At the Kraimert School, we believe in 
presence in teaching." DeLa said. "Our goal 
was to oulfit a distance leaming classroom 
in which the professor and the students 
have as much of the same quality of pres- 
ence as they have in a face-to-face class."

BLOOMINGTON, Ind, (lU 
News) — Today, Dana Johnson 
feels hkeshcwon Ihe loilery. But 
not long ago, the Los /Uigeles 
native didn^ think she had a bet- 
tor's chance. Friends and 
acquaintances told her as much 
when she set oul to make a living 
by doing what she truly loved — 
writing. 

And that's exactly whal she 
told herself when, as a graduate 
student in the Indiana University 
Creative Writing Program, she 
casually submitted her master's 
thesis to the committee of the

To her surprise, the former 
magazine editor won the 2000 
O'Connor Aivard for her debut 
work. Break Any Woman Doivn. 
a collection of short stories 
exploring race, identity and 
alienation. 

She was invited to join the

Writing Program. On Ocl, 5, she

the inaugural Huraton/ Wright 
Legacy Awards ceremony in 
Washmgton, D.C. 

The awards, the first nation- 
al honors presented by the com- 
munity of black writers lo pub- 
lished writers of African descent, 
are named for the legendary 
Afncan American writers Zora 
Ncalc Hurston and Richard 
Wrighl. 

Some of the biggest stars of 
African American literature 
attended the Oscar-like atvards 
ceremony in the nation's capital, 
including celebrated authors 
Terry McMillian; E. Lyrui Harris 
and Nathan McCall. 

Even though she didn't win 
the grand prize, Johnson 
described the experience as 
"simply amazing" and said she 
fell honored to be included in 
such illustrious company. 

"Everyone used to tell me, 
'You can't do this (writing for a 
living). People don't really do 
this.' ' Johnson said. "It's still all

ries, now prominently featured

summer of 2003 

The nine slories in "Break 
Any Woman Down" feature the 
voices of women of varying ages, 
nationalities and backgrounds 
who are exploring Iheir personal 
relationships and discovering 
their identities through sexual 
and emotional intimacy with the 
men in their lives. 

Johnson introduces the 
reader to a smorgasbord of 
unique and memorable charac- 
ters ranging from Avery, an 11- 
year-old girl from Los Angeles in 
love witn a white boy from 
Oklahoma, to La Donna, aiLenot- 
ic dancer whose boyfriend 
insists she stop stripping. 

In telling these slories. 
Johnson captures the social and 
vemacular peculiarities of Ihe 

t regions i 
from which her char 
including Los Angeles, the South 
and various immigrant corrimunities. 

"Thisisan exciting and gor- 
geous hterary debut," wrote 
Jonathan Ames, author of "The 
Extra Man." - 

Johnson, who said she is 
most comfortable writing from the 
first- person point of view because 
il allows the reader to hear "real" 
voices, conducted very little 
research in creaHng such vivid and 
authentic characters. 

"My family is from the 
South (Teruiessee), so Ihe 
Southern voice wasn't so foreign 
to me," she said. "And I've 
ahvays listened closely to people 
in general, tvhich allowed me to 
write about characters of differ- 
ent nationabties, such as Italian, 
I've never been interested in the 
idea that you're a black writer, so 
you need to write a certain ivay, 
about certain characters, in a cer- 



blucs mixed with jazz, meant lo 
be heard and read aloud." 

Johnson is currently work- 
ing on her first novel, based on 
her short story about 11-year-old 
Avery, which will continue to 
focus on the girl's assimilation 
intosociety ana follow her matu- 
ration into adulthood. The 
author is quick to point out, 
though, that while her novel 
does draw on some personal 
ciperienccs, it is "not exactly 
autobiographi ' " 



"It's

interesting to explore the differ- 
ent voices that you've been sur- 
rounded by, voices that speak to 
class and can best illustrate 
where a person comes from," 

"Dana is impressively deft 
at both story lines and narrative 
voice," said Tonv Ardizzone, 
director ol (U's Creative Writing 
Program. 

"Like a skilled ventrilo- 
quist, she's able to capture the 
inner voices of a ivide range of 
characters, regardless of their 
race or gender. 

"Her short stories are like 



languagt 
nation of how language plays an 
important role in this girl's 
assimilation," she said. "It will 
follow all the changes she goes 
through, in a way that I couldn't 
have accomplished in short- 
story form." 

Additionally. Johnson will 
continue her role as a member of 
one of the nation's oldest and 
most distinguished creative writ- 
ing programs. 

Indiana University at 
DIoomington was one of the fiist 
■ universities lo grant a m.uter's 
degree in creative writing, 
awarding its first graduate cre- 
ative writing degree in 1949 to 
Kiel and novelist David 
agoner. Johnson, who teaches 
writing and literature, joiru an 
impressive list ol iiutructors 
that, at one time or another, 
included Robert Frost. 

Marguerite Young, Robert P.T, 
Coffm. Robert Penn Warren and 
Jotm Crowe Ransom. 

Johruon said she is proud to 
be part of such a highly regarded 
and exceptionally diverse piugiam. 

Currently. 25 percent of the 
program's first-, second- and 
third-year MFA students are 
African American, Asian, 
Latino/a or Native American. 

And she is happy with the 
recognition her debut work has 
received, though it mearu more 
pressure to compleie her follow- 
up project. 

"My agent has been very 
patient with me," she laughed. 

It also means she won't be 
sneaking up on anyone, but 
Johnson doesn't seem too 
concerned. .

Match 4; The lU Battle Royal 
Entrants: The best Indiana bas- 
ketball players of all-time 

This match is called off 
when everyone realizes that lU 
has never had a great player. 11 
was a nice try, though. 

Maybe net! time we can 
have the same match wilh Duke 
players, but then again the ring 
might not be able to hold that 
many people. 



The Main Event: 
The Road Rage Battle Royal 
Entrants: Jimmy Spencer. Kur

Her 



tlie top rope. But alas. Spencer's 
size is a disadvantage as the top 
rope breaks and he tumbles over 
as well. 

Ffarvick and Slewarl stare 
each other down now. It's lime to 
sec who is NASCAR's bad boy 
Bui did we forget someone? 
Hermie comes (lying off the lop 
rope wilh a moonsault, Hermie 
hils both Slewarl and Harvick, 
causing them to sail over the top 
rope. Sadler's experience is the 
ace in this deck. 

Winner. Hermie Sadler 

Now wouldn't thai be fun^ 
Maybe it's just my sick fantasy lo 
see our well-known pro alhletes 
come lo blows. But if anyone oul 
there has the cash to put this 
together, feel free to give me a 
call. Who wouldn't pay money 



They have bickered, thrown 
gloves and helmets al each other 
and even exchanged some harsh

Match 2: The Big West Battle 

(Tag- Team Match) 

Chris Webber and Doug 

Christie 

vs. Shaifuille O'Neal and Rick 

Fox 

H^, wouldn't this baltic be 

great? Rick Fox can finally get a 

chance lo fight Doug Christie 

somewhere other than the 

Staples Ccnler turuiel. And once 

again, Fox con rely on his ger\et- 

ic freak teammate O'Neal to help 



Jimmy Spencer will quickly 
dispose of his archrival. The 5-1 1, 
ISO-pound Kurt Busch has no 
shot at this one. 

Looking down the lineup, 
you may wonder how the enthu- 
siastic southerner Hetmie Sadler 
Ills in. Although Hermie has not 
had any problems, he has Ihe 
background ne ' &lt;. . . 

match like this. 









The Lakers will try to take 
the easy way out (something match, 
they aiv used to) by attempting 
to bribe Webber When that does- 
n't work, it's pure bedlam. Il's 
only a matter of time before Fox 
and Chrishe find a tunnel some- 
where in Ihc arena and begin 
exchanging head locks. 

But, as soon as O'Neal takes 
control of Webber, cipect lo see 
Ihe rest of the Fab Five make an 
appearance — wilh their parole 



weeks ago that Hermie made his 
pro-wrestling debut. Teaming 
wilh BC James, Hermie landed a 
perfect moonsault on Jelf Jarretl
