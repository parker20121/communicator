By D rand on Schwa r7c, Reporler 

Suffering some form of depression is not

that every year. VVhal is uncommon, however, is 
widespread public awareness about the disease. 

In recognition ol this lacl. October lllh is

rpFW will help edu- 
cate students and fac- 
ulty about the oflcn 



Wliat: 
Depression 



symptor 






Awareness Day 

When: 

Thursday, Oct. 11. 

11 a.m. to 7 p.m. 

WItere: 

Walb Student 

Union 

Cost: 

Admission is free. 



The mosl promi- 
nent indlcalion ol 
depression is a pro- 
longed and intense 
teelmg ol sadness. 
Accompanying symp- 
toms may include 
troubled sleep pat- 
terns, a change in 
appetite and extreme 
mood swings. Also 
prcserit may be the 
inability to conccniralc. 

Depression's most serious symptom, howev- 
er, is the contcmplalion of suicide. According to 
the American Psychiatric Association, SO to 90 
percent of people who undergo medical treat- 
ment for depression experience significant 
improvement within two to three weeks, 

Rccogni/ing the need lor treatment, however, 
can be difficult. While the symptoms of depres- 
sion may be present, they often can be explained 
away by physical ailments. 

To address the ignorance surrounding depres- 
sion, IPFW Nurse Practitioner Karen Salser and 
other IPFW health associates have organized 
what she calls 3 "mini- depress ion fair." 

The fair, which focuses on education and self- 
awareness will be held on Thursday, Oct. 11 on 
the first noor of Walb Student Union. 

From 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., mental health profes- 
sionals will be eonducling depression screen- 
ings. The screenings will be held in private 
rooms to maintain participants' confidenlitality. 
Begmning at noon is an houi-long seminar 
entitled. "Suicide SOS," which includes a pres- 
entation and a discussion period. Tamara Drov&gt;n 
and Jolin Swineharl, two professional counselors 
with Park Center Life Plan will be conducting 
the session. 

A second seminar, called "Success with 
Support." is scheduled for 530 and will also lost 
an liour. This presentation and discussion will be 
hosted by Denny Howard, director of Family 
Care Center. 

Salser's mini -depression fair is sponsored by 
several IPFW organizations, including the 
IPFW/Parkview Health and Wellness Clinic. 
IPFW Personal Counseling, IPFW Wellness and 
the IPFW Department of Athletics, Recreation 
and Intramural Sports. 

The fair is open to students, faculty and the 
general public. It is tree of charge.

$2.65 million awarded in contract 



y Todd Hamm, News Editor 



As part ol its ongoing mission to support nur'^- 
tng education in the community, Parkview Health 
Systems awarded the department of nursing S2.ti? 
million in a contract on Oct. 3, 

Carol Stembcrger, chair of the department ol 
nursing said the money will be used to integrate 
technolDg&gt;' and update equipment. 

Stembetgcr said the nursing department is pur- 
chasing several new maruiequins and a heart 
arrhythmia simulator and monitor for student 
trainmg. One of the mannequins resembles an 
infant and can be used for blood draws and differ- 
ent types of procedures as they pertain to the care 

Slemberger also said the department is evaluat- 
ing several other mannequii\s that have multiple 
technology (unctions. One features a built-in micro- 
phone and speaker. A teacher or aide using a micro- 
phone connected to the mannequin in a different 
room talks to the student as he or she trains on it. 

Theexercisc, whichmaybepartof a new virtual 
training lab. is designed to compel students to 
"communicate with the marmcquin as if it is a real 
person ."Stembcrger said. "It requires a student to 
practice his or her communication skills." 

Fifty- thousand dollars of the grant will be ear- 
marked each year (or scholarships, Stcmbei^er 
said. Currently, Mary Hyman, a retired registered 
nurse, provides the department with three or four 
S500 scholarships oiuiually. The Parkview grant 
gives the department the potential to have many 
more scholarships available each year. 

The department is using some of the money to 

pay a three-quarter time nursing adviser who was 

added to the staff earlier this year, Slemberger said

History Club explores

Whereas the actions and 
presence o( America'

this new 

and senseless evil. 

The History Club's lecture, 'Terrorism Today: 
Education and Understanding the Face of 
Tragedy," presented by James Lulz, professor and 
chair of political science, was an attempt to per- 
sonify and explain tertorism as a political reafity. 

He began his lechire by first defirung terrorism. 
He remarked that defirung tills term has been dif- 
ficult and has caused some debate. But Luiz pre- 
sented six necessary characteristics for terrorism. 
Lutz's described the characteristics as follows: 

l)Therc must be political goals. If an organiza- 
tion carries out violent acts out its goals are not 
political, then it is not terrorism, LuIz said the 
mafia Is an example of this. 

2)There must be violence or a Ihreal of violence. 
Violence is the chief means of coercion terrorists 
use, Lutz said. Terrorist groups believe they will 
not be taken seriously if mere is no history o( vio- 



3)Then3 must be organization. If a group is to 
be effective, then leadership, structure, goals and 
a fuiancial base all must be present, 

4)The group must target an audience beyond 
the immediate victims. The attacks on the World 
Trade Ccnici and the Pentagon, for instance, not 
only .iffectcd the victims, but most if not all of the 
world. "The US, is targeted because we are a 
superpower," Lutz said- "You wouldn't be effec- 
tive in attacking Denmark, for example." 

5)Actions of the group must generate terror in 
their target audicnce(s). This is why, LuIz said, 
terrorists target a large number of innocent civil- 
ians. If a sense of terror is created among the peo- 
ple, it generates enormous political leruions and 
pressure on the govemmeoLs the terrorists arc 
against. 

6}Fin3l1y, lor an act to be considered that of a 
terrorist group, it must involve a non-stale actor. 
The WTC attacks are considered terrorist in 
nature because they arc widely believed to have 
been orchestrated bv bin Laden, who docs not 
officially work for the Taliban. The bombing o( 
Pearl Marhor is not considered an act of terrorism 
because it was carried out by the Japanese state, or 
empire. That was an act of war, Lutz explained. 

Lutz also spoke about the 'why's' of terrorism. 
He eiplained that it Is a reaction to change. "It is 
a har)(cning back lo traditional values." said Lut;. 

Many believe that modernity and globallsm 
present challenges to faith of Islam. Some feel that 
the western presence in the Middle East is con- 
taminating traditional Arab culture and values. 

Lutz concluded his lecture bv addressing some 
" ' hold about lerror- 



of the misconcep lions people I

By Heidi Saliba. Editor 

In a meeting last TTiursday, Oct- 7 General

"Culture and Values" section of the Strategic Plan. 

Vice-Ch.incellor for Student Alfairs Susan 
Hannah said others had mentioned the concern In 
earlier meetings, and agreed it was a good recom- 
mendation. She said the is5ue was not over 
whether to include it. but how to word it. 

Chancellor Michael Wartell attended the meet- 
ing and ar\swercd concerns ol duscussion partici- 
Gmts. The meeting, which was held in the Neff 
all audilonum, drew a crowd of about 15 people.

PBS-39 builds station on campus 



By Todd Hamm, News Editor 

In a combined effort to upgrade and expand 
facililies and technology as well as lap into Ihe cre- 
ative resources at IPFW. PBS 39 broke ground on a 
new SS5 million broadcasting and administrative 
building Sept, 38. 

The building, scheduled to be completed late 
nexl year, is located on IPFW-owned land near the 
northeast comer of Crescent Avenue, and 
Coliseum Blvd. 

The close proximity to IPFW will mean "much 
broader opportunities for students lo get intern- 
ships in television and broadcasting," Chancellor 
Michael Wartell said. 

"PBS39's nearness and friendly profess ioruil ism 
will be tcrriHc assets for IPFW and the communi- 
cation department," said David Swilzer. chair of 
Ihe department of coiiununication. "1 served on 
die PBS 39 board for 9 years and know the station 
well. It is a terrific resource of media profession- 

' Swilzer said Ihe department currently leaches 
' its television courses in Ihe Channel 56 sludio in 
Helmke Librar)-. Local professionab as well as 
I communicalion faculty teach the courses. 

Mark Ryan, promotions manager for PElS-39 
I said station officials will also have oetter access to 
' creative ir\fluence from IPFW 



journalism faculty at the new building. 

Ryan said the state-of-the-art, professional 
broadcasting facility will provide more space lor 
television production. It will also have Ihe capabil- 
ity Id broadcast both digital and analogue signals, 

Ryan said the Federal Communication 
Commission, which oversees television statioru. 
mandated that by May 2003 PBS affiliates across 
the nation must broadcast digital signals. He said 
Ihe FCC is also requiring commercial slalions to 
broadcast digital signals.but by an earlier dale. 

Digital broadcasting. Ryan said, "will be a 
quantum leap in telei'ision. He explained that the 
format not only increases audio and picture quali- 
ty, but also allows for slalions lo simulcast up to 
six different programs. He said PBS-39 will simul- 
cast four programs regularlv. 

Ryan added that digital television allows for 
more ol thepicture to fit on the screen. It allows for 
slab'ons to dovmload text and graphics to viewers' 
computers to supplement programs. It alsoallov/s 
viewers lo stop programs in progress and finish 
watching them at a later time. 

Content on Ihe station will remain primarily 
educational. Ryan satd-

Note; This letter is nol in any ivay about the play 
Corpus Christi; please dot&gt;'l misunderstand. 

I've raccnlly conducted a very informal study 
of university-approved postings. By postings, I 
mean Ihe official announcements, fliers and 
posters hanging in Ihe hallways, stairwells and 
classrooms all over IPFVV's campus. What's truly 
amazed me is the sheer numtwr of fjosting focus- 
ing on gay issues. 

I was recently attending my Thursday night 
class in KelUcr Hail when I glanced al Ihe tack 
board. Three out of seven postings had a gay-ori- 
ented message or a gay-oricnied announcement. 
Aboul 42.9 percent of the postings were about 
something going on in Ihe gay commuruly. Why 
such a large portion? (Additionally, I was scratch- 
ing my head at the Kelller Hall exhibil (Isl floor, 
wcsl side), thai focuses on many gay-onented suti- 
|ecU.| 

Please don't get me wrong. I'm not trying to 



1 say amen lo Bush, I love 
what he's doing to them.

not to be prejudiced. However, I and many 
ight people like me are confused aboul Ihe gay 
munily s apparent need to make gender pref-

Rainbow bumper slickers, "Cay Pride"

intelligent, open-minded, straight adults at IPFW 
and accross Ihe country. I need help in under- 
standing these issues, liccause I truly carmol thin); 
of why they are so necessary. 

In this letter, I've inlcntionally avoided 
mllammatory comments. Ml respect any response 
lo my query that docs the same. 

Eric Haai 



Since the beginning of the semeslei, I have 
been reading Mr. Diehl's columns and I wanted to 
take a moment to applaud The Communicator for 
publishing them. At first I was irritated — perhaps 
an understandable response given that Mr. Diehl's 
first column of the year strove, quite colorfully, to 
attack my lifestyle, personal Ijeliefs and principles 
— bul smce then I have come to be deeply enter- 
tained by Mr. Diehl's words, and look forward to 
them each week with zeal. I discovered this sum- 
mer thai when dealing with people who loudly 
proclaim themselves lo be speaking from a conser- 
vative. Christian point-of-view, the bcsl thing to 
do is simply let Ihem have their say and reserve 
comment. Give Ihem enou^ rope and theylJ hang 
themselves. Mr, Diehl has taken this to all new lev- 
els in my prsonal experience — he makes the 21 
stale legislators who so recently attempted to sue 
our umveisity seem like rational, intelligent peo- 
ple. 
I Since his tirade reganling my senior project, 
I Mr. Diehl has enlighlcned us with a ralher graph' 
I ic, if not entirely medically accurate account of 
late-lerm aborhon which gave me fits of giggles 
for nearly hvo weeks. The idea that lale-lerm alwr- 



trol is Icgitiniatelv an argument often used by the 
Pro-Ufe movement, bul Mr. r&gt;i^l-s take on it was 
hardly understandable and seemed designed lo do 
little more than shock. As an artisl, I'm more Ihan 
familiar with shock value, but I find il tiesi to main- 
lain at least some semblance of the Irulh when 
using it- it's more much effective that way. Going 
beyond that, il was the fact thai Mr. Diehl tilmsell 
will never be in need of an abortion (late-lerm or 
otherwise) thai amused me the most. It often 
seems the most fervent enemies of choice are peo- 



pie who will never tie in a position that forces them 
lo choose. That being the case, perhaps they 
should leave the mailer lo those il actually pertains 

Most lecenlly, Mr. Diefil delighted me by 
informing nol only myself, bul every olher reader 
of The Communlcalor that he feels like he appears 
gaybyholdingopcnlhedoor for another man, bul 
cannot hold open the door for a woman on campus 
without feeline as if it appears he is hitting on her. 
The rationale here goes far beyond my ability lo 
analyze, but I would thir\k that Mr. Diehl's com- 
ments indicate more of what he himself thinks 
than about how others actually perceive him. I fre- 
quently hold open Ihe door for many men 
(whether I'm nol dating them or nol) and women 
alike and never think anything of it. Then again, 
it's quite apparent I'm more secure about certain 
things Ihan Mr. Diehl could ever hope to be. As for 
him holding the door open for women, I'd actual- 
ly have lo advise him lo avoid this altogether. His 
earlier editorials indicate that he can barely muster 
the strength for a complete sentence without 
attempting to hit on a woman — take his Corpus 
Christi editorial for example — and I would Itiink 
for someone as devoutly 'Christian" and 'conser- 
vative" as himself a sexual harassment suit would 
look quite bad. 

Regardless of how much I disagree with Mr. 
Diehl. as a conservative, and as a human being, I 
hope to continue reading more from him in the 
year ahead. Little else gives me as much pleasure 
as opening the paper and seeing w)\at he has losay 
each week^ Keep up Ihe good work!

In the past month si

someone could possibly war 
innocent avilians for l\w 
cause of advancing their 
religion. 

One factor has stuck 
out in my mind like a sore 
thumb. People who refuse 
lo abide by the rules will 
continue to break more 
and more rules until effec- 
tive punishment has been 
appUed to (he individual 
or groups breaking the 

"J«' Nathan Diehl, 

This is very evident in Managing Editor 
the case of the Osama bin 

Laden-lead group Al Qncda, Al Qaeda has repeat- 
edly expressed a strong hatred against the United 
Stales and allegedly bombed the WTC buildings 
and several United Slates embassies. 

The only punishment the organization ever 
received included a few threats and some isolated 
and mostly ineffective bombs dropped under order 
from former President Clinton. Al Qaeda was j 

affected only minimally in those attacks. 

It is orJy this week, under order from 
President Bush, that Al Qaeda will reap the sour 
rewards of their terrorist hearts. The massive offen- 
sive attack launched by the United Slates and other 
countries will teach bin Laden and Al Qaeda a 
well-needed lesson. 

The lesson, in the words of our president, is: 
"Peace and freedom will prevail." 

The massive offensive against the Taliban and 
Al Qaeda has begun to show the world that the 
United States will not bow under pressure from 
any group and no one will push President Bush or 
our citizens around. 

True leadership lies in one's power over those 
who will nol submit to the authority of those over 
them. Respect is earned not in strong words or a 
we 1 1 -delivered speech, but in reputation. 

As President Bush holds onto Gallup's 
all-time highest approval rating at 90 percent, his 
level of national and international respect as the 
type of president who says whal he means and 
means what he says continues lo rise. 

This is a reputation that everyone should 
strive for, so that people would not think our 
words mean one thing when our actions actually 
say another 'Yes' should mean 'yes' and 'no' 
should mean 'no.' 

Not until we come to realization that 
rule-breakers will not be tolerated will the 
rule-breakers themselves come under scrutiny and 
become rule-keepers. Those who refuse to follow 
the rules must then be subject to any force and 
sanctions necessary. 

But as we watch television and see the retalia- 
tion against the Taliban and Al Qaeda, let us not 
forget Ihal war is not the solution to every prob- 
lem. Stop the rule-breakers at the first sign of hos- 
tility; don't wait until a major problem comes 
along.

From this perspective: the voice of a Muslim 

Student leader Mahmudur Bhuiya speaks on his 
faith, values in Islam and America 




By Heidi Saliba, Editor 

For Mahmudur Bhuiya, il's all about rcspecl. 

The computer science major, who olten worts more than 

14 hours n day, is aboul lo graduate in Deccmt&gt;cf. He already 

- has a master's degree 

politics, speaks 

ur languages and 

ads a fifth, comes 

I from a large and suc- 

I ccsstui family and 

I has (nends who treat 



Bangladesh. India. 
Bhuiyais a practicing 
Muslim. HU faith in 
Allah is based on the 
Quran, ivhich Bhuiya 
descrit)M as the last 
of four books wrillcn 

God. Strong tn his 
laith and rooted 5 

5 in its teachings, 
Bhuiva is respeclful 
of the beliefs of olh- 



"Islam always taught us it you don't honor other rcli- 
gioru, if you don I respect other religions, you are not honor- 
ing or respecting your (own) religion," Bhuiya says. "So this is 
the reason lo live in peace with one another." 



Some Indian citizens are Buddhist. "In Bangladesh, all reli- 
gious people can live logether." Bhuiya soys. 

Lfpon arriving in the US in 1W3, he \ 
witness race-based discrimination. 

"I did nol find any discrimination in the US. based on 
religion." Bhuiya says. "I found discriminalion on color, 
Ijelwecn blacks and whiles. That was Ihc firsi lime I saw dis- 
crimination based on black and while. In our country, dis- 
criminalion laws are based on the Hindu and Muslim reli. 

When he was nine years old, Bhuiya had a best friend 
who was a Hindu. The two played (veil together until one day 
ivhen Biuiya was over at Ivis friend's house and asked for a 
glass of water. After a long absence and consultation with his 
parents, the friend relumed without the water in hand. Bhuiya 
says the friend's family ivas afraid lo let him drink from one of 
their glasses because they thought his Muslim germs might 
nol have washed off. 

Such stories, apparently, arc among (he reasons lor 
Indian laws similar in nature to integration and Affirmative 
Action laws in America. Having lived in both counlrics, 
Bhuiya understands the need lo respect both religioru and 
races As a United Stales citizen and supporter of President 
George W, Bush, he is glad thai Muslims were included in a 






Slates is united of all religion 
that's a real politician. I surely 
appicdale what he did." 

Bhuiya ciTdits Bush with leading (he lulion in the drive 
against both lerronsm and internal discrimmation based on 
mLsconcep lions linking cetlitm religions lo violence. 

"Whenever anv terrorist incidcnis happen, the Muslim 
people are largeled firsI," Bhuiya says. 'When someone is 
bombed, first Ihey come to the Muslim people. The same thing 
IS happerving again and again; I don't know what is Ihe reason 
l&gt;ehind 

it... the attacks were unexpected incidents that claimed inno- 
cent people. I do believe we have lerrortsls in our religion, but 
also Christian people have that problem... Hind us have that 

Erobtem..." Christians in Bosnia, Bhuiya cites (or example, 
illed Muslims in thai country during America's involvement 
in fightmg in the region. Bhuiya says he docs not tielicvc ter- 
rorists are truly motivated wilh spiritual goals, but by their 
own agendas and will. 

"There is no religious reason behind terrorism — it's all 
emotional," Bhuiya says. The student stresses thai in a numl)cr 
of sects exist in Islam, jusl as in Judaism and Christianity. 
Muslims, for instance, may be Sunni, Shiile or fundamcnialisl. 
Not all Muslims, in Dhuiya's opinion, follow Istam as they 
should. Persons who degrade women are among those he cites 
lor failing lo live out the Quran's teachings, 

"1 think the Arabic people have some kind ol complcK.- 
They are treating women like servants. That's not laughl itt 
Islam." Bhuiya says. "They are totally motivating people lit 
the wrong way. 1 think Ihc reason is Ihey have money. They 
believe what they're doing is right. Bui it s nol. Lots of Arabic 
people, however, follow Islam correctly." 

Bhuiya says he believes all people should be educated, 
and that Ihe Quran leaches that men and women are lo be 
treated equally "Islam actually respecls women more than 
men." he says. "II a divorced man wants to re-marry, for 
example, he must gel permission from (irsi wife. Children afe 
laughl thai their haven is near their mother's feel." 

He explains comparahve aspects of his faith in this way: 
"Muslims believe in all prophels that came into the world, but 
we do nol believe Jesus is Ihc Son of God. Muhammed Is llio 
last prophet. Thai's Ihe main difference. I believe, between 
Christianity and Islam." 

Despite whatever differences and accompanying misun- 
derstandings exist between the Iwo, though. Bhuiya says he 
has not been the target of others' suspicions after Ihe New 
York and Washington, D.C. attacks. 

"1 think our Fort Wayne campus is truly different. Il's 
fine, I feel greal. Everyone's treating me Ihcsamc," he says. He 
and area Muslims, however, hope Ihal all Americaru live aul 
and respecl the things that Ihey preach. The VS. wanls lo

Afghanistan 
and its people 

Twenty-six years ago. AfyJiaiiislan tens a peaceful country. 
Temj Dougherty of ITS was a Peace Corp volunteer at the time 
and pholograpbed the laud and its people. In this photo essay, 
Dougherty's undtrrstanding of Afghanistan in ilie early 1970s is 
explained in the past tense, allhough the implications of bis per- 
spective are still pertinent today.* 

-■ All photos are from the early 1970s and were contributed by 
Dougherty. 




Above: An Afghan boys' high school class studied moli 
ular theory in this outside classroom. Below: Women of 
the Kuchi clan of the nomadic Pushtun tribe of 
Afghanistan would usually travel through an area in 
morning, while men would follow in the evening i 
sheep and goats. The Pushtun tribe historically traversed 
the entire Hindu Kush mountam range and often crossed 
borders into neighboring nations. They were the domi- 
nant nomadic tribe of Afghanistan. They would weave 
and sell carpets but were also known as smugglers. Most 
of the Taliban are of this ethnic group. 





Right: This mother 
of five would usual- 
ly bake bread every 
in her outdoor 
kitcnen. The time- 
consuming process, 
along with other 
cooking and care- 
taking duties, wi 
occupy most of the 
woman's time d 
ing the day a 
early evening. 



Above: Like most three-year old Afghan children, Gulmakai 
(whose name means, "see the flower") would stick close to her 
ither for most of the day. The infant morlalily rate ir 
Afghanistan during the 1970s was more than 15 percent; 25 per- 
cent of all children died before age five. 




Left: Before the rule of (he Taliban, womun 
Afghanistan were ediLcated through the W-i 
grade. By the age of 13 or 14, most girls w. 
married; at this point their formal educali 

considered complete. Daughters of the 
wealthy were usually the only ones to attend 
;chools, since most other families could not 
ifford the girls time away from home for stud- 
ies (rather than helping in the kitchen). The 
education of women has been forbiddi 
Afghanistan since the mid-1990s, when the 
Taliban murdered president Najibullah and 
captured the city of Kabul and gained control of 
most of the country.

Campus reactions to the attacks on America 



Pagans lead campus in support, prayer 

Group leaders say nmiibers, officers worked ivith Bialikfor 
quick organization of on-cantpits vigil 



By Heidi &amp;iliba, Edilor 

Wilhin hours of Ihc allacks on New 
York and Washinglon, D.C., (cremy 
Slurglll of Ihe Pagan SludenLV Alliance 
conUcled members al Ihc group aboul 
planning an on-&lt;ampus prayer service or 

Vigil- 

The group's members, however, were 
already in-process organiiting Ihe even! on 

"It was so Iraumalic. I i3\A why does- 
n't PSA do a candlelight vigil? (Other 
members) were thinking the same thing." 
Slurgill said. "The anger Ihroughout Ihe 
community was so harsh and prevalent, 
Ihat a moment of healing needed to hap- 
pen, and quickly." 

A 90-minulc vigil was held 
Wedne«lay, Sept. 12 in Ihe evening hours 



outside Classroom Medical buildmg. near 
the rainbow-colored friendship monu- 
ment which marks Ihe area. The service 
was Ihe first on -cam pus 'response lo the 
attacks which occurred Ihe previous day. 

Slurgill. who handles public relations 
tor PSA. said members and officers of Ihe 
group put the vigil together in less Ihan 24 
hours. By 7 p.m- on Ihe day ol Ihe allacks, 
I^A members were handing oul fliers 
around Walb Union and across campus 
announcing Ihe event and explaining its 
purpose. Slurgill said the inler-faith gath- 
ering, which drew about 65 people, was 
led through its first prayer by the oo-cam- 
pu5 student group Inlervarsity Christian 
Fellowship, 

"I was very, very happy that 
[nlervarsity made an appearance." Slurgill 
said. "Yes. it was organized by PSA but 



really it ivas (or the IPFW campus as a 
whole." 

Slurgill said Dean of Students Donna 
Bialik was "very supportive" in approving 
the quicklyjut-logelher event. "She was 
incredible, she stepped up lo bat to let 
this happen and deserves a respectiul 
tharJt-you," he said. 

SturgiU eommctiled that Ihe Sept- 11 
attacks affect everyone, and F^A's current

calls for education, understanding

Studenis from Inlervarsity Christian Fellowship, the 
Pagan Students' Alliance and students of olhet religious 
backgrounds gathered last week to draft a ictlcr lo President 
Bush. The idea was birthed out of conversation between 
members of the Christian and Muslim faiths. 

"This is an agreement of the hearts and minds of students 
of two different faiths," said Kent Ziessler, leader of north- 
east Indiana's Intervarsity Christian Fellowship. "El's a coali- 
tion between Christians and Muslims. I don't know about 
that happening anyivherc. I've never been so encouraged 
about my relationship with my Muslim friends as I am right- 
now because we're truly standing together on this and it's 
not just political — it's conviction."

Many students at IPFW may not be 
aware that Ihe university has a program in 
Peace and Conflict studies. Since the 
tragedy al the World Trade Center, howev- 
er, the field has taken on special impor- 
tance. Professor Richard Johnson enjoys a 
rare joint appointment at IPFW: he has 
been a professor of German here since 
1974. and the director of Peace and 
Conflict Studies, which he founded in 
1&lt;I89. Johnson began his activism as a stu- 
dent in E&gt;ecember of 1959. In 1981, he to- 
lounded Ihe Center lor Nonviolence in 
Fort Wayne, ivhich seeks non-violent alter- 
natives to domestic violence. He also 
researched peace issues at IPFW l)cf ore the 
Peace and Conflict program began, 

Johnson leaches a wide variety of 
courses, including Introduction lo Peace 
and Conflict Studies, which will be offered 



standing terrorism. We just dcdded that 
this week," Johnson said. Other courses 
for futun: semesters include an Honors 
course on Gandhi - the non-violent 
aclivist from India - in Spring 1002 and, 
during the first summer semester, a study 
tour on the civil rights movement which 
will lake him and students to important 
signposts of Ihe times, such as 
Birmingham and Selma, Ala. He also 
leaches German half-time. 

Johnson believes that his knowledge 
of languages is ver)' important to his inter- 
est in diversity. "My personal opinion is 
that language work is essential in diversi- 
ty work," he said, "We really learn a lot 
about a culture tlunugh language. It's an 
important window...! wish that American 
students would really learn languages and 
travel lo olhcr cultures. Language is fun- 
damental to diversity work." 

Along the same lines. Johnson said 
diversity and peace go hand in hand, 
"Peace studies is always international or 
transnational in focus. A major focus in 
peace studies is understanding societies 
and their cultures. That is just foundation- 
al. Vic are always looking for diversity 



,vithin a 



:ullur 



but also between cul- 
, Peace studies is a mear^s towards 
realizing a diversity ol cultures. Wars and 
violent conflict tend to dcslroy diversity." 
That is why, when Johnson teaches non- 
violent action, he teaches it from a multi- 
cultural perspective. It is also why a cul- 
ture has only to gain from fostering diver- 
sity within its own ranks. 

culture, you give the people of that cul- 
ture an opportunity to proudly assert 
who they are without hurling anybody 
else. This reduces violence and increases 
peaceful cooperation." 

Johnson is very concerned by the 
recent terrorist atlacks on The United 
States and thinks we should learn from it 
and move forward, 

"1 feel much sadness about what hap- 
pened in New York. I think the most 
important thing we c.in do is understand 
the causes. I'm concerned that many poo- 

Glc arc not looking at why this happened, 
nderstanding it docsn t justify it, but 
may help as a preventive in the future. 
That's whv I want lo teach Ihe spring 
course. A lot of people say that terrorisis 
did this 'because they hate us,' but thai 
might not be enough of an explanation. 
Terrorists may be reacting not just againsi 



lent question. I think we've made progress 
and we also have a long ivay to go, Tliose 
on the Diversity Council and several oth- 
ers al Ihe university arc very interested in 
doing something, but it's not true that 
everybody supports diversity in any 
active way. It s a fairly new campus, 
though I would say Ihat. in Ihe last ten 
years, there have been efforts to foster 
diversity Even so, 1 think it will take at 
least a generation. We can accelerate the 
process, but it won't happen right away" 
He mentioned that in limes pasi, 
higher education for everyone was not on 
the agenda of most universities in the 
United States. "We arc seeking to democ- 
ratize Ihe uni- 

takcs a lot of 
work. There's 
a university 

culture, and 

changing it 
requires rather

One of Jotutson's favored solutions 
for moving forward after the tragedy is 
international coalition building. He also 
feels that it would be wise for Americans 
to understand ilslam better and to reach 

"Religions are complex, and 1 think it 
would bear significant fruit for us to build 
bridges with moderate Muslims. Many 
Muslims would say that we don't care 
about them, and I would like lo prove 
them wrong. We need to be really intercsl- 
ed in understanding Islam." 

Closer to home. Johnson Itas been a 
member ol IPFW's Diversity Council for 
the last six years. The council tries to foster 
a love for, and the presence of, diversity on 
campus. When asKcd about the prospects 
for a greater understanding of diversity at 
IPRV, his response ivas. "That's an excel-

Attached lo Ihis area is a wooden floor with a 
mirrored wall and bars where aerobic dance class- 
es are held throughout the year.

Also at students' disposal are hvc racquet-

while working out. 

Numerous activities such as fitness assess-

Duo lo the Icrrorul allaclu. week Iwo of ihc NFL 
g.im&lt;s was cincpllml, .ind hghlfully so. Rut vie would hiivc 
witnessed a slampede showdowi 
Indianapolis Colls and Ihc Denver Bronco 
have displayed Ihe league's mo*l eiplosivi 
lirsl Iwo games. 

The Colts are nevertheless galloping 
ncnis. The ColLs' lerrilic Irio of QB Peylt 
Edgerrin lames and WR Marvin Harris 
of/en-iivc extravaganza during Ihcir first 

Their Itrsl victim was Ihe New York Jels. The Jels have 
a respectable oKense with velcran QB Vinny Teslcvcrdc and 
the underrated BB Curtis Marlin.Thcy managed to score 24 
points ag.iinst the Colts on Sept. 9, but it couldn't compare 
lo Ihe 45 poinLs Ihe Colts racked up. 

Theirsecondviclim was another AFC division foe. The 
Buffalo Dills came into Ihc RCA Dome hoping to carry 
home a division win. With a young, quick QB, Rob 
Johnson's offense managed to scare the Colls early. In fad, 
Ihe Bills' defense began the scoring after rookie come rbjck 
Niile Clements relumed an inlerceplion from ManninR's 
second pj5.s ol Ihe game, bul he and his offense were virtu- 
ally flawless after thai. 

The Colls eventually scored 42 due lo an awesome and 
vcrsaiilv offensive array of run and pass. Manning has 
already broken the 400 yard passing mark by throwing for 
42t yatds, including four TDs, James had his fiflh straight 
100 yard game, plus one TD. Harrison caught for 146 yards 
and IhreeTDs. 

Whal's even scarier is Ihe breaking out of a lourlh 
oiferuivc Ihreal; Manning's now second favorite target, 
emerging WR Jerome Palhon. Pathon has been inconsislent 
in the past, bul reati7ing that young lalenl and new draft 
picks threalen his job, his recent performance has ranked 
among Ihe league's best. Alter both the Jels' and Bills' 
games, il was Pathon who led the Colls in receiving. Let's 
just add in one more (actor to Ihe Colt's offense: Ihe 
no-huddle offense. 

However, defense is the one area where the Colls have 
lacked greatness. In fact, they ranked near the bottom of Ihe 



improvement. They made off-season acquisil 
the ground allack. 

Bul who needs a defense when you have such an 
cKplosivc ollensc? We saw one-dimensional teams ivin the 
lasl Iwo Superbowls. The Warner/ Faulk/Brucc offense in 
St. Louis won it in 2000. The Lewis/Woodson defense ol 
Baltimore won it lasl season. 1 think the 
Manning/James/Harrisony Pathon offeiue can do it in 
January. So beware NFL dcJense, the Colls an,' galloping. 1 
reckon you best step aside.

The transition to Division I soccer has been 
challcngmg lor Ihe IPFW men's soccer team. 
With five losses, the Dons were looking for Ihcir 
fiiTit win as the DePaul Blue Demons came lo 
town on Sept. 26 

The game began as past IPFW games have 
begun this season. The Dons created scoring 
opportunities, but the opposing learn controlled 
possession and scored lirsl. DePaul's Ed Kielcr 
was able to scn'e the ball across the goalmouth, 
finding Dimitri Rousseau, who headed il past 
IPFW goalkeeper, Peter Hachai. The If'FW 
defense (ailed lo challenge Ihe ball and DcPaul 
capilali/fd. 

The Dons had been in this situation before, 
but had never rc-spondcd the way Ihcy did 
against DePaul. Just 30 seconds lalcr. IPFW's 
Marko (agustin dribbled past the DePaul keeper 
and firmly placed Ihe ball in Ihe open net. From 
that point on. the Dons never looked back. They 



began lo win loose balls, dominated in the air 
and controlled Ihe midHeld by tight passing and 
oll'the-ball movcmenl. TTic first half ended 



forward Scth Fishelson. Fishclson 
bniughl do«m in Ihe DePaul penally box and 
was awarded a penally kick. Captain Ian Luya 
stepped up and buned the ball toward the 
uppct-right comer o( Ihe net, 

(I&gt;e(ender Sarllomicj Wojtyla had Iwo 
superb shots for IPFW after Luya's goal. He 
failed lo score, but IPFW's pressure was increas- 
ing. However, DePaul wasn't finished, cither 
Blue Demon forward Chris Greer displayed 
some excellent ball skills. He was able lo lest 



slopping Greer's shot.
