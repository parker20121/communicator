ByKURTULLMAN 

The equivalency controversy was 
fueled this week by the administra- 
tion at I.U. A memorandum with the 
official cancellation of the English 
equivalent courses contained a 
surprise 1 hat involved both schools. 

The problem began on April 3, 1974, 
when Ralph E. Broyles, chancellor of 
Indiana here, issued a memorandum 
to Dr. David Skelton of the registrar's 
office. The memo, given to the 
i iinniuinieiitor by the chancellor's 
office, said "Will you please take 
s^eps to see that Indiana University 
does not autlimi/e (emphasis theirs l 
implementation of the following 
equivalencies at this time." Those 
courses to be cancelled included 
previously announced English cours- 
es and equivalencies in business and 
economics for I.U. and industrial 
management for Purdue. 

Roger J Manges, dean and director 
of the Purdue administration, early 
this week met with Broyles to resolve 
the differences between the two 
schools and have the equivalencies 
implemented in lime for the summer 
and fall semesters. The negotiations 
apparently ended with nothing 
changed as far as the I.U. adminis- 
tration was concerned. 

Magnes then talked with Skelton 
and told the registrar that he was to 
register the courses as the original 
agreement indicates, which is eur- 
renily being done. 

Broyles said that the problem was 
aquestion of muti-lateral establish- 
ment of the equivalencies. He stated 
that Purdue did not include the I.U.

eiuiivalencie." according to Broyles. 
"One is that the bugetary implica- 
tions have not been completely 
researched. Reason number two is 
that there was not a proper 
involvement of the I.U administra-

4 student speakers to 
compete nationally 



By TOMMY FRANKE 

Four members of the Purdue- 
Indiana Student Speakers will com- 
pete in national contests as a result of 
their victories in Indiana intercollegi- 



According to the AUP paper, the 
Irregular, there were a total of 92 
ballots received. Of this number, 52 
were received in envelopes bearing 
the signature of the voting party, and 
considered to he authenticated votes 
on the question. 

The question posed by the faculty 
organization was whether or not the 
presidents had the confidence that the 
presidents were acting knowledge- 






best interests of the 
its, and academic 
programs of the school. 

Of the 52 authenticated votes, 4 
respondents have confidence in the 
presidents. 41 do not, and 7 abstained 
from voting. There also were 40 
ballots submitted anonymously from 
the instructors. The vote totals on 
these were 11 voles of confidence, 24 
no confidence and 5 with no vote. 

The faculty were also asked if 
they agreed with the statement that 
the interests of the faculty, students, 
n best be served by 



n of Indiana-Purdue to a 
separate, independent state univer- 
sity with a separate, independent 
state-wide board of trustees. 

32 professors who sent in 
authenticated ballots agreed, 19 
disagreed and one abstained. 

In the unauthenticated ballots, 18 
agreed with the statement lauding 
independence, and 22 disagreed. 

In toto, 50 faculty members 
indicated that this university should 
be independent. 

Vets office to go to 
Bloomington hearing 

There will be a hearing at Indiana 
University in Bloomington this 
Thursday for veterans to air their 
complaints regarding the veteran 
problems. Senator Vance Hartke, who 
is currently sponsoring a bill to 
increase G.I. benefits, is hosting the 
hearing.

On March 25 Meg Mettler, Denise 
Yaney, Saul Fields, and Sharon Ault 
were accompanied by faculty spon- 
sors Richard Hess and P. Dale Ware 
to Ball State University for the 
competition with students from seven 
other Hoosier colleges and univer- 

Miss Yaney and Miss Mettler 
participated in the Indiana State 
Oratorical Association (ISOA) com- 
petition Miss Mettler placed second, 
which qualifies her to participate in 
the Interstate Oratorical Association 
competition to be held at Southern 
Colorado State College in Pueblo May 



Miss Yaney placed third, which 
qualifies her to attend if Miss Mettler 
cannot. 

Both were awarded plaques for 
their Hoosier achievements. 

The contest that Misses Mettler 
and Yaney participated in required 
the students to have a memorized 
speech of 1500 to 1800 words, 
preferably Problem-Solution or Per- 
suasion. In past years men and 
women competed in separate cate- 
gories in this event; however, this 
year a female Wisconsin student 
threatened the ISOA with a lawsuit of 
sexual discrimination Consequently, 



New course contest 



The COMMUNICATOR. 
with the help of an anonymous 
benefactor, is sponsoring a 
contest to try (o get ideas for 
new and innovative courses that 
students would like to see 
offered at Indiana-Purdue. 

Ideas should be submitted 
typewritten, no longer than 50 
words per idea, and deposited in 
the boxes at the stands before 
April 19. 

The ideas will be judged by 



First prize will be $25 and 
there will be five $10 second 
place awards given.

Speech committee for further 

competition. 

Fields was awarded second place 
in the Extemporaneous Peace Speech 
category. A tape of his speech will

the National 



Miss Mettler's speech will be 
published in the 1974 edition of 
Winning Speeches, published by the 
Interstate Oratorical Association. 

At the business meeting held at 
State for participating ISOA 



schools, Hess was elected I 
Secretary for 1974. 

Miss Yaney, Miss Mettler and 
Lynda Jackson have all qualified to 
compete in the National Individual 
Events Tournament to be held at the 
State University of New York in 
Pittsburgh. New York, April 19-21. 

To qualify for this competition the 
students had to place in the final 
round at a speech tournament during 
the 1973-74 academic year. The 
Purdue-Indiana Student Speakers 
competed in six tournaments this 
year, excluding the ISOA. 



E. Stonebarger, head of the I.U. 
Division of Business and Economics. 

"The major problem with the 
equivalencies at this campus," 
according to Gilbert, "is that when 
the two sehools agreed that one school 
would have one academic mission 
They also said that it would furnish to 
the other school classes in the area of 
it's mission." Thus Purdue wanted to 
offer courses in business and 
economics to their students who 
planned to transfer to the main 
campus to complete their degree 
work and asked the I.U. department 
to furnish them, 

Gilbert did not feel that the 
budgetary problems uutlined by the 
I.U. administration were of much 
consequence. 

"There are two basic kinds of 
equivalencies according to the mis- 
sion agreement," said Gilbert. "One 
kind is when students of both schools 
would lake from both faculties, such 
as the English equivalencies. The 
second kind is when one school takes 
from the other with no students from 
the other involved." The industrial 
management courses fall into the 
latter category. 

Under the equivalency agreement, 
I.U. would furnish faculty for the 
equivanlent courses. Purdue would 
then transfer )o I.U. the entire $20 (Hi 



enrollment fee and pay the student's 
$7.00 building fund assesment. Thus 
for every hour that a P.U. student 
took from an I.U. instructor, the latter 
school would make a "profit" of the 
$7.00 building fee This would help 
I.U. lessen the impact of the 
W! i5,0«). &lt;M&gt; defecii it paid to Purdue 
last year under the program Gilbert 
also slated that P.U.'s only concern 
was that that students are given the 
best education possible. 

Gilbert denied Broyles' charges 
mat P.U. did not consul! with the I.U. 
administration. Richard L. Desmond, 
dean of faculties of I.U. here, sent a 
memorandum to Gilbert on October 9, 
1973, recounting a paper presented by 
Stonebarger and Hill setting out 
which courses were to be considered 
equivalent The memo indicated that 
I.U. would grant the equivalencies 
effective next year. 

According to Stonebarger and Hill, 
the equivalencies were set-up mainly 
as a convience to students at 
registration lime Even under the old 
eoiidil ions. Pun lue students could and 
did take the courses by applying for 
admission to I.U. as a transient 
student and then following the normal 
registration procedures. At the end of

The first two super-chancellor candidates were on campus last week, 
and at least one did not like what he saw.

hinted to a faculty panel that he may not be interested in the jot. wilhnul ;i

Neither candidate was given a job description "1 any kind. Neither 
knew In whom hi' would be reporting nor who would he reporting to him. 
Both candidates wereexlpnsed to IU-PU faculty, staff, and students that 
had no better of an idea on what the situation is. 

Schwartz summed it up pretty well when he said thai the campus 
must lirsl determine whal Us mission in Northeast Indiana is Until thai 
mission is determined, the campus cannnt have any idea of what the 
future should aod will hold. 

Neither candidate was interviewed by the two university presidents 
It is a rule of thumb that any job candidate is interviewed by his potential 
immediate superior This mav suggest that the super-chancellor will not 
report directly to the presidents at all, but through a modified RCA 
bureaucracy.

aind to fill the position and do not want to waste

The presidents have said repeatedly that the super-chancellor would 
report directly to them, and that the field was wide open to all potential 
candidates Whv do we no longer believe what the presidents say? 

The mood of'imslrusl that exists on Ibis campus is endangering the 
orderly unification of IU-PU. That mood is certainly scaring the 
super-chancellor candidates. 

This newspaper is just as sceptical of the promises of the two 
presidents as is anyone else. The frustration is getting old, but we just 
do not know what to do about it. 



Student elections 



Tomorrow and Wednesday will be the voting for student body 
president and other Students' Government officials. The camlpaign has 
been low-keyed, so the voter turnout can be expected to be low. 

Both the Alliance for a Campus Together l ACT) and the Un-Party are 
factions of the Alliance for a Better Campus (ABC), the party that has 
been in power the last three years. ABC has always been a broad-based 
coalition of very different types of individuals, sticking together only 
through compromise. 

Apparently no compromise coalition could be reached this year, 
probably because there was no opposition to ABC. Also, personal 
ambitions were more intense this time around. 

Both parties have indicated the desire to reform Hie roahlion after 
the election. To preserve the environment for this coalition, the campaign 
has heen kept free of the usual mud-slinging. 

The Comniunicaloi would like to see this post election coalition come 
about. In this regard, we will not endorse either party or presidential 
candidate. 

We do urge students to vote a split ticket, because both parties have 
some excellent senatorial and Student Union Board candidates. We also 
remind students that the only polling place is located in Kettler Hall. 



By CHARLES PRATT 

Within the Students' Government 
there lie the resources lo provide 
broad ranging services to students of 
this campus. The ACT party, with the 
experience 'it each of its candidates, 
feels that it can create a Govern- 
mental body with a broader appeal to 



and

Charles Pratt is Hie Alliance 
for a Campus Together candi- 
date tor Student Body President. 
He is presently a member nf the 



the Activity Card to the average 
sludent is of major importance to the 
ACT candidates. We feel one way of 
building this program is to negotiate 
with area businesses to provide 
discounts on food and entertainment 
to Activity Card holders during the 
academic year. The ACT party also 
believes in the programs of the 
Student Union Board. Film Series, 
and the Convocations Committee 
should appeal to a broader base of 
students. We also feel that activities 
should be increased to provide 
programs in the Student Union during 
the week. 

The ACT party believes that the 
Students' Government should be an 
efficient, business-like organization. 
In order to achieve this goal we would 
like to incorporate a program of 
independent study within Students' 
Government In other words, we 
advocate a program whereby non- 
elected student government parti- 
cipants would receive some academic 
credits for the services they provide. 
We also believe that there is room in 
Students' Government for a large 
number of students. It will be the 
responsibility of the president of the 
student body to delegate authority to 
many students in order to broaden the 
representation of our government. 

The ACT party feels that it is 
important to expand the present 
facilities of the recreational area and 
to reduce the cost to the Activity Card 
holder. 

Intramural sports is another area 
of concern to the ACT party. Our 
candidates feel that participation 
should be increased and made 
available to all interested students. 

Broadly, the ACT party believes 
that the responsibility of the Students' 
Government should 



programs. The ACT party is also 
hopeful of improving the environment 
of our campus by effectively 
improving the lagoon in front of the 
Student Union. 

The ACT party believes that the 
Students' Government should remain 
non-partisan in their dealings with 
outside political and community 

Finally as the name of our party 
indicates, Alliance for a Campus 
Together, we believe in bringing 
Students' Government and the 
students of this campus together. We 
believe that our campus should 
preserve the degrees of both Indiana 
and Purdue, while striving to make 
the university community act and 
participate as one unit. 

Our basic pledge is to provide to 
the students of this campus a 
government that is open to a wide 
variety of participation and that can 
act effectively towards securing 
students rights and s

Have you ever sat down and 
thought about what your purpose was 
here on earth? Did you want to 
change the world but didn't know 
what to do? To us, it's beginning with 
our environment, our homes, our 
social lives, and what we take part in 
every day. School plays a large role in 



our lives at the present time. What 
can we do to make these times 
memorable ones and not just years 
gone by? For myself, it is involve- 

Two years ago I came to this 
campus, not knowing anyone. Today 
I've shared memorable and good 
times with many friends I've made on 
campus. Mike Yann and I 




worked hard in bringing good 
entertainment to this campus in the 
past two years. This was a goal I'd set 
for myself after the first dance I 
attended. I thought it was pathetic 
and knew changes could be made to 

I feel I've reached that goal and 
now set myself to more serious 
matters. 

-I. The students education: Are 
the students getting the most out of 
what we call our higher education? 

-2. The quality of education at 
this campus compared to other 
colleges: Do you go to other campuses 
and say, '"Gee, I wish we had that on 
our campus." 

-3. The students' possibilities of 
succeeding after college. Will we have 
a job when we are finished with our 
education? 

-A. The help needed in completing 
college at this campus, for example: 
Proper training, facilities and coun- 



All of these ideas affect you and 
me every day. What should we do 
about them? 

I hope you will lend your support 
for the Un-Party. We are a group of 
students who want to make something 
of our campus. If you spend five 
minutes of your time to vote, we will 
spend an entire year to help you. 

Students, the possibilities and 
opportunities are here for what we 
call a great campus! Let's take 
advantage of them!

Luther Thomas was born in 
Alexander City. Alabama in 1890. He 
started working at seven years of age 
and he hasn't slopped yet, While 
growing up in the south, "he held an 
assortment of jobs from picking 
cotton to cooking for one of 
Hinmnnliams leading hotels. 

He moved his family to Cleveland 
hoping for more educational and 
economic opportunities Once he was 
situated, he quickly realized that even 
in the north opportunities for the 
black man were severely limited. 

He was hired by a building firm 
and for 47 years he was one of their 
most valued employees In those 47 
years he was never absent and never 
'ate His employers had a great deal 
of respect for such an industrious 
Negro Upon his retirement, he was 
presented with a check for four weeks 
salary and a pat on the back 
Generous, wouldn't you say'' The only 



iron will. He always boasted of never 
being sick a day in his life. One day I 
came outside to find him stooped 
over. He couldn't hear me talking 
because the power mower was on. I 
happened to look down and the top of 
his shoe was gone and so were two 
toes. It seemed he had gotten his foot 
caught in the lawn mower. I was 
absolutely frantic and anxious to get 
him to the hospital. He stood in that 
very spot ignoring the pain and the 
blood, and informed me that he had 
never been to a hospital and he wasn't 
about to let a little cut send him! 
Unfortunately foi him. I had inherited 
some of that stubborness, so his 
record was spoiled. 

1 firmly believe that in some other 
time, some other place, he could have 
been a great leader He always had 



such pride, such dignity. Quiet and 

decisive, he spent his entire life 
working and providing for his family. 
He continues to work around the 
house. Working is a necessity for him. 
I have never known him to sleep past 
eight nor take a nap in the afternoon. 



He has a garden and he enjoys that. 
He sings in the church choir and does 
his thing. 

Do I tend to make him seem 20 
feet tall? If I do, it's because I'm 
slightly prejudiced and I cannot seem 
to help it. I want you to know him as I

Bumper to bumper 



To the Editor: 

If you have ever used the A. P.O. 
book exchange to rid yourself of 
unwanted books or to pick up those 
much needed books for this semester, 
you know its value. 

If you have ever been in an 
accident an required blood, A.P.O. 
was there providing the Red Cross 
with donors; students helping 
students. 

But like so many other things 
today, these two projects along with 
numerous others are doomed to 
extinction unless more students are 
willing to lend a helping hand. This 
fine organization, which has helped 
the students so much over the years, 
is now reaching out for some help in 

A.P.O. is suffering from a lack of 
genuine interest and involvement, 
and so, many of its projects, or 
possible projects are doomed. This 
fine organization is composed of 
young people all genuinely wanting to 
lend a helping hand to their fellow 
students. They have been involved not 
only in the projects above, but also 
such outstanding community projects 
as United Way, WOWO Penny Pitch, 
as well as holding the First Screw of 
the Year Award to raise money for a 



needy little girl. They also support a 
little'girl in South America. 

What is A.P.O.? A.P.O. is a 
service fraternity, .reaching out to 
help those in need, mainly you the 
students. But it is not all work and like 
numerous other organizations, we 
have parties, usually after we wind up 
a successful project (which is quite 
often) . It is one very good way to meet 
people. A.P.O. has had many projects 
that involved area businesses and 
their officers. As most everyone 
knows, a little pull never hurts. 
Involvement in school and commu- 
nity affairs is a sure way to meet 
people. 

Those interested in giving even a 
few minutes of time are invited to join 
A.P.O. to experience what happens 
with involvement. This is not a 
time-demanding organization; just 
one geared toward helping others and 
helping yoursejf at the same time. 

Is it worth your time? Are you 
willing to check into this organiza- 
tion? DO YOU CARE? If you do, 
come to a meeting this Sunday, April 
21 at 7:30 p.m. in the Student Union 
building to see if A.P.O. has

Most of the Chicago White Sox players enjoyed their 
spring training session down in Florida under manager 
Chuck Tanner. The South Side Sox had many problems to 
solve concerning the 1974 campaign, but knew that no 
matter what happened in Sarasota, it would be an exciting 
season for the fans. 

They should never have left the serene southern state. 
They found this out quickly.. .in their home opener against 
the California Angels last week. 

In the game itself, the Sox were bombed by the very 
mediocre Angels, 8-2. Their top two hurlcrs were shelled by 
the light-hitting Californtans. But that wasn't where the 

In the last half of the game, hundreds of fights broke out 
across White Sox Park. One man told me he had to hustle 
his wife to the nearest exit in the sixth inning after four 
young men threatened to carve them both up if they didn't 
come up with a quick donation for beer. 

You think that's bad? The man estimated that the 
"young men" were of these ages: 10, 12, 14, and 16! The 
three younger ones each had brought a six-pack into the 



sixth inning, the children were out of Stroh's and l 
clamoring for another round. 

The man, in Fort Wayne on business, recounted to me 
(as I waited on his table at the Cork 'n Cleaver) that no one 
would help him and his wife. And he claimed that the 
youngest of the quartet looked meaner than the 
demon-possessed girl in The Exorcist.

WhiteSox relief ace Terry Forster, who was creamed 
by the Angels and nearly creamed by a full can of beer, 
offered, "I was afraid for my wife and child up there in the 
stands. What man would bring his family to something like 
this? I've never seen anything like it It was ugly." 

Slugger Ken Henderson stated: "If that goes on all

The man who told me his story concerning the opening 
day affair saw only one streaker during his limited stay at 
the park. But there were reports in the papers of many 

As can be expected, the White Sox management placed 
a big share of the blame for the chaos in the stands on the 
streakers. There were tall ones, fat ones, small ones, old 
veterans, young rookies, both male and female.

IRISH RIVALS RE.IOICE 

Recently Notre Dame All-American John Sumate 
decided to pass up his last year of eligibility and enter the 
realm of professional basketball. At a news conference he 
offered his reasons for seeking an early pro career: "It was 
a difficult decision. I tried to be objective in weighing all the 
circumstances. But I had my family to consider first, Notre 
Dame second and myself third. Being able to help my 
mother, father and sisters was the biggest factor 
influencing my decision. One of the biggest reasons I came 
to college was so that, after I graduated, I would be able to 
help my family. 

So John Shumate has decided that he needs pro 
basketball. And pro basketball needs a lot more of his kind. 

Digger Phelps, Shumate's mentor and national 
Coach-of-the-Year, sums it all up concerning his departing 



Dame and to his family." Let's hope that Mr. Shumate 
makes it big in the pro ranks and that his attitude rubs off on 
other athletes. 

EVERYBODY INTO THE ACT 

A new group is trying to purchase Charlie 0. Finley's 
ABA club, the Memphis Tarns. The group is headed by none 
other than Finley's best known employee, MVP Reggie 
Jackson of the World Champion Oakland Athletics, 

Jackson and another member of the group have definite 
ideas on what they'd do if they would be able to buy the 
bungled franchise Irom Finley. Gary Walker stresses that 
lines of communication would be opened, from team trainer 
to the top heads in the front office. He states: "The most 
important thing is to be able to do your best mentally and 
physically. Then winning comes as a result. In the long run, 
we think our programs would make better athletes." 

Anything would be an improvement over Finley, and 
the group headed by Jackson appears like it would be a 
world of improvement for the Tarns, the worst pro team in 

TAKE CARE. SPORTS FREAKS!
