Veterans to have job fair March 30 



A job fair for veterans will be held 
Mrach 30, 1974, at the Fort Wayne 
National Guard Armory, 330 N. 
Clinton St. in conjunction with 
National Viet Nam Veterans week, 
according to the Office of Veterans 
Affairs for the city. 

Approximately thirty Fort Wayne 
area companies will have displays 
and representatives at the fair to 
discuss job opportunities with the vet. 

"This will be mainly to acquaint 
the ■ veterans with the different 
employers," said Frank Mathias of 
the city VA office. "It's going to be 
more informal than going to the 
office, filling out an application and 
then having them tell you to come 
back in two weeks." 

During the fair, vets will have an 
opportunity to talk with someone in 
the personnel departments, to ask

bership chairman of IW will be 
present. 



While the idea of the job fair has 
been used for many years throughout 
(he cnuntrv this is tin- first ye.ir for 
one to be held in Fort Wayne. It has 
met with great success in other parts 
of the country and according to Miss 
Mathias this is the first of many that 
will be held in the future. 

Task force to meet 

The Task Force on Academic 
Structure formed by the Ad Hoc Joint 
Faculty Steering Committee will hold 
an open meeting March 26, 1974 from 
2:30 p.m. until 4:30 p.m. in Room 178 
of Kettler hall.

present speaker 

IU-PU Geology Club presents Dr. 
Alfred C. Lenz, University of Western 
Ontario. He will speak on "Some 
Aspects of Paleozoic Development of 
Northwestern Canada," in the Stud- 
ent Union, room 224, 4:30 p.m., 
Friday, March 22. 



Local companies will be repre- 
sented along with the Armed Forces 
and other educational institutions at 
the fair. It was noted that there were 
no requirements for those who wish to 
attend with Miss Mathias stressing 
that some undergraduate students 
might want to be there to lay the 
groundwork for future employment 
and discover the requirements of the 
companies that they are interested in.

Indiana University's Regional Camp- 
us Administration Office that a plan 
for equivalent courses, in effect a 
combination of the offerings of the 
two faculties, were being rescinded, 
during the last semester the two 
departments began work establishing 
a series of equivalencies tor courses 
with the idea of combining faculties in 
order to be able to offer more varied 
courses. Fifty-three equivalencies 
were established and sent to academ- 
ic deans James Gilbert of Purdue and 
Richard Desmond of IU and were 
approved for immediate implemen- 
tation. They were included in the 
schedule for fall and next year's 
university catalog. 

"We have had three committees, 
made up of faculty members of both 
sides, working for several days a 
week for a good part of the semester 
trying to establish a common 
composition program with a combin- 
ed department and unified curricu- 
lum, to get the students the very best 
that both universities had to offer," 
said Clifford Nault, head of the 
Purdue department. 

Nault noted that the local 
departments have been working on 
that assumption and had the 
assurance of the two academic deans 
that the equivalencies would be 
strictly a Fort Wayne Imatter. So far 
as Nault is concerned, they still are 
equivalencies, but will not be listed on 
the schedules as such. 

Presumably both schools will 
accept credit for the other's courses, 
but the students will still have to 
register for classes offered by the 
other department as transient stu- 
dents and then transfer the grades 
back to their school," said Nault. 

Nault said that the likelihood of 
having the equivalencies reinstated 
was dim. "But the assumption 
everyone has to make is that this 
came from Chancellor Sylvia E. 
Bowman, and if she says 'no' she is 
not going to turn around and say 
'yes'," explained Nault. While there is 
no direct evidence to tie Miss 
Bowman with the order, Nault noted 
that she is the Chancellor of the RCA 
and any decision from them would 
have to be approved by her. 



When questioned on the possibili- 
ty that the order to cancel the 
equivalencies came from Blooming- 
ton. Nault said that the main campus 
is oblivious to the situation at this 
campus, pointing out that the 
Chemistry curriculum at Blooming- 
ton is completely different from here. 

Noting that almost all are exact 
equivalencies, Nault said, "There 
mat be three of the fifty-three thai are 
not perfect fits, but by and large they 

Nault did not think that the recent 
announcement by John Ryan, and 
Arthur T. Hansen, presidents of IU. 
and Purdue respectively, delaying 
unification of this campus affected 
the approval of the equivalancies. 1"

Golf courses to 
open tomorrow 

Fort Wayne's three municipally 
owned golf courses, Foster Park, 
McMillen Park and Shoaff Park, will 
officially open for the season on 
Friday March 22. weather permitting. 

The Department of Public Parks 
announced that the same profession- 
als will be reatained: Bill Berg at 
Foster Park, Ralph Vetter at Shoaff 
Park, and Bill Miller at McMillen 
Park. Each of the three is a registered 
PGA professional. 

Foster Park is a regulation 
course of 6158 yards and a par of 71. 
McMillen Park is an executive course 
stretching 4703 yards and playing to a 
par of 65. The par three Shoaff Park 
course totals 2912 yards with a par of 
54. The front nine holes at McMillen 
Park are lighted and available for 
night play until 12:00 midnight. 

Each course is open to the public 
and offers daily greens, fee play, 
season ticket play, league play, and a 
schedule of tournaments. Season 
tickets for juniors, adults, seniors, 
and families are available at each 

The Foster, McMillen, and Shoaff 
Park courses all offer complete 
pro-shops, concessions, cart rentals, 
and individual and group lessons. 
Interested Persons may contact one

currently a Student Senator, is 
preparing a brief to be submitted to 
the Supreme Court contesting his 
possible exclusion from the ticket. 

According to the election code 
section of the Student Body Constitu- 
tion, "Aspirants (of the office of Vice 
President or President) shall be 
taking at least nine credit hours and 
enrolled in a degree seeking program . 

The Un-Party is expected to 
argue that the candidate only needs to 
be registered in nine or more hours. If 
this view is upheld by the Supreme 
Court, it would still be possible for 
Johnson to run, since he could 
pre-register for nine hours next fall 
before the final filing date. 

Sources close to the Election 
Board state that that group's opinion 
is that the word "taking" means 
presently enrolled. Under this inter- 
pretation, Johnson could not run for 
that office because he is not in the 
process of ' ' taking" the hours 
required by the constitution. 

Although members of the Sup- 
reme Court were unavailable for 
official comment, the court is 
expected to be called to session as 
soon as is possible to make a final 
determination in time for the 
Un-Party to slate another candidate. 

Brush once a day 

Dental researchers report that 
once a day is sufficient for adults to 
brush their teeth, providing they do it 
effectively with a soft-bristled brush 
designed to clean all surfaces of the 
teeth and between the teeth and gums 
without injuring them. 

Effective toothbrushing takes 
time-there is no shortcut to healthy 
teeth and gums. 



the window. Seventeenth Century 
Greek Literature For Purdue students 
is gone, A course that they do not 
require at IU here, but is required in 
Bloomington, is gone for Indiana 
students," said Nault 

Steve Hollander, a member of the 
Purdue English faculty, noted that 



what it means is that some courses 
won't be offered at all, due to light 
enrollment and other factors. It was 
also noted that those courses not 
cancelled will include some with 
enrollments so low that it would cost a 
lot more than it would have under the 
equivalency system. 

"The effect is that any number of 
l hose courses will probably have to be 
cancelled after pre-registration, or 
will have very few students and be 
verv expensive to run," according to 
Nault. 

Another major consideration for 
the student is that there will be less 
choice of times and days for classes 
than there would have been other- 
wise. The Nature of Literature study 
was cited by Nault as an example. 
Under the equivalency plan, there 
would have been two professors 
available to students of both sides 
thus giving a choice of days and 
hours. Now the Purdue people have to 
lake courses from a PU instructor, 
while the IU people have to work their 
one offering into their schedule. 

The department noted that even 
though the equivalencies were not 
approved, there would be arrange- 
ments made to complete classes not 
available. "If we have majors who 
are nearly ready to graduate and 
have courses they must gel, wc will 
see that they get them!" noted 
Hollander "We will do it on an 
overload basis, individual study, but 
it should not be necessary."

'No fault' denies women equity 



Go Northrop! 



The Fori Wayne Northrop Bruins will he going into the IHSAA 
tournament finals Saturday afternoon. They will clash with Lafayette 
Jefferson at 1:30 p.m. at the Indiana basketball arena in Bloominglon. 

They defeated highly touted Anderson 67-53 last Saturday to capture 
semi-state honors. 

Northrop has reeled off 24 straight victories, a rec ord for Fort Wayne 
high school teams. Two more victories will bring them the state 
championship, the highest honor of achievement in Indiana high school 
athletics. 

It has been a long time since Fori Wayne has had a state champion. 
The truth is that it was nearly twenty years ago when South Side achieved 
this status 

Today's high school and college generation haven't had the 
opportunity to witness a state championship by a Fort Wayne tea. 

The staff of the Communicator wishes the best of luck to the Northrup 
Bruins. We sincerely hope that Coach Bob Dille and his team can bring 
home a championship.

In 1531 Henry VIII of England 
wanted to shed his wife of 18 years, 
Caiherine of Aragon, in order to 
marry her lady-in-waiting, Ann 
Boleyn. When the Pope refused to 
annul his marriage, Henry severed 
religious ties with the Vatican and 
established himself as head of the 
Church of England. The first and only 
doctrinal change he enacted was the 
right to a divorce, immediately 
granted to himself. 

In 1973, Gov. Marvin Mandel of 
Maryland requested a divorce from 
his wife of 32 years, Barbara 
tBootsie) Mandel, in order to marry 
his publicly acknowledged sweet- 
heart, Mrs. Jeanne Dorsey (who was 
4 years old on his wedding day). To 
date, Barbara Mandel has refused to 
lei her husband, the governor, divorce 
her. Recently a no-fault divorce bill 
was introduced in the Maryland state 
legislature which would grant a 



divorce upon the unilaleral applica- 
tion of either spouse that his or her 
male is incompatible.

LETTERS to the EDITOR 



Animal research article misleads readers, veterinarians 



D.V.M. (Feb. 1974) misleads the 
reader and does a disservice to young 
people who believe they can best help 
animals by becoming veterinarians 
There is no difference in the methods 
used in research for animals and 
research for humans: both entail the 
artificial production of disease, injury 
and generally death in the animals, 
and both include the extremes of 
suffering. The only difhynce is in the 
label In the testing 2C drugs and 
chemicals, for example, whether the 
compound is for animals or people, 
veterinarians inflict the revolting 
LD50 from which 50 per cent of the 
animals must die from poisoning. In 
fact il appears that the poisoning to 






death of laboratory 
veterinary specialty, 
prestigious journals 
well-known drug and chemical com- 
panies routinely advertise for veteri- 
narians to test their drugs and 
chemicals And what about all the 
veterinary radiation killings that are 
going on at institutions all across the 
country, some at military installa- 
tions? What label goes on those? 

Dr. Garlick and the American 
Humane Association might have 
better served the public, the veteri- 
nary profession, and those veterinary 
students who have had to drop out 
because they would not do what their 
instructors were teaching them to do 
to animals had the article discussed 
the change that is taking place in the 
veterinary schools. The prime pur- 
pose of veterinary education is to 
produce competent patient-care vet- 
erinarians, just as the real purpose of 
medical schools is to produce 
competent human patient-care physi- 
cians. But today veterinary schools 
are directing their attention not to the 
needs of animals but to "animal 
models" of human disease and injury. 
It is true, of course, that Congress is 
subsidizingthis perversion of veteri- 
nary education with untold millions of 
dollars from the pockets of the public 
while our communities suffer from 
lack of adequate and competent 
veterinary services, in our opinion. 
veterinarians themselves, especially 
veterinary students, should not allow 
their educational institutions to be 
"bought" and perverted in this way. 

Dr. Garlick's article raises 
another question. Why have so many 
major humane societies, at both the 
national and local levels, allied 
themselves with veterinarians, when 
the activities and goals of the latter 
are so foreign to what most people 
think are the objectives of humane 
societies? The "labor union" of 
veterinarians, the American Veteri- 
nary Medical Association, is a 
registered lobby which historically 
has lobbied for the increasing use of 
laboratory animals, the construction 
of more facilities to hold more 
laboratory animals, etc., and for the 
seizure of animals from pounds and 
shelters all over the country for use as 
laboratory animals. The only conces- 
sion the organized veterinarians have 
been willing to make is that 
laboratory animals could receive 
'humane care and treatment," but 
even that turned out to mean 
laboratory animal breeding and 
husbandry, more construction of 
laboratory animal facilities, and 
"unfettered freedom" for research- 
ers to do whatever they pleased to 
laboratory animals. 

Is il right and proper for ANY 
humane society to ally itself with 
, members of a regis- 



tered lobby? We at UAA, for example, 
could not collaborate with veterinari- 
registered lobby, 



contrary to the intent of the Internal 
Revenue Service's Regulations that 
govern such tax-exempt organiza- 
tions as humane societies who may 
not lobby, and rightfully should not 
seek to attain their goals by lobbying 
themselves or having a registered 
lobby do il for them. We do not believe 
the IRS grants a tax exempt status to 
a humane society only to have it join 
forces with a registered lobby, yet the 
American Veterinary Medical Asso- 
ciation lists the American Humane 



of 

related interest" in its Directory. 
Numerous veterinarians are star 
speakers at AHA's meetings. Other 
societies too seem to require the aid oi 
veterinarians at their meetings and 
some go so far as electing veterinari- 
ans to their boards of directors. 
Societies in California seem especial- 
ly prone to lean on veterinarians. 

As an analogy, what would the 
public think if the environmental 
groups who have opposed building an 
Alaskan oil pipeline joined forces with 
the builders of the pipeline? Surely an 
enlightened public would conclude 
that the environmental groups had 
violated basic standards of ethical 
conduct and practices. We believe 
that humane societies have an 
obligation to observe ethical stand- 
ards of conduct and practices, too. 

We appreciate that some humane 
societies who have elected veterinari- 
ans to their boards of directors 
operate shelters in which veterinari- 
ans perform certain medical servic- 
es. But the rendering of medical 
services to animals in shelters is no 
reason to elect the attending 
members of a regis- 
lobby, to policy-setting posts o 



bnlh 



cated the relief of animal 

suffering who would devote them- 
selves to that end in a shelter without 
attempting to infiltrate the societies' 
boards. 

Any discussion of ethics would not 
be complete without consideration of 
the "cronyism "that exists between 
humane societies, veterinarians and 
what can be called the vivisection 
industry. Dr. Garlick and Rutherford 
T. Phillips, executive director of the 
Humane i 

of the 
for Laboratory Animal 
Science, a sort of combination 
"labor union-trade association" that 
i promote the procurement, 



animal experimenters who profit 
from the use of laboratory animals, 
laboratory animal breeders, dealers 
and importers, laboratory cage and 
equipment manufacturers, labora- 
tory animal feed producers, and 
representatives of such cruel animal- 
using Federal executive agencies as 
the National Institutes of Health, the 
Atomic Energy Commission, the 
various agencies of the Department of 
Defense, the Department of Agricul- 

While membership in the AALAS 
may be right and proper for Dr. 
Garelik, how does one account for 
similar membership of a humane 
society, the American Humane 
Association, whose objectives, one 
might think, do not coincide with 



livelihoods by irradiating beagle dogs 
and other animals the radiation 
veterinarians have been maiming and 
killing for a quarter of a century. 
Could such "cronyism" exist in any 
other field? In our view, it shouldn't 
exist in animal welfare either. So far 
as we have observed, no other 
humane society in this country has 
gone so far as to join the AALAS, but 
the Humane Society of the United 
States has named a panel of 
veterinary "advisors", some of whom 
are AALAS members. What kind of 
advice will the HSUS be getting? 
Anyone who thinks that cronies who 
all belong to the same "club" are 
say or do anything 



place in that club. 



iDo, 



ibyi 



and published by the Centaur Press, 
relates that in 1890 a veterinarian was 
called upon to "rebuke" the humane 
movement when "powerful indivi- 
duals in the Washington, D. C. 
Humane society made an effort to ban 
animal research completely." These 
individuals, the 1890 veterinarian 
said, "are alienating from coopera- 
tion with humane societies the great 
humane forces of this country, viz., 
the medical and veterinary profes- 
sions, the biologists, the universities, 
and the Agriculture Department of 



time for the liberal and intelligent 
members of the American Humane 
Association, who joined that organi- 
zation to prevent cruelty to animals... 
lo stop and consider whether they are 
called upon to further support and 
encourage those narrow-minded and 
intolerant people whose efforts are a 
hindrance rather than aid to the cause 
of humanity"? Thus, even back in 
1890, veterinarians were attempting 
to tell humanitarians and the 
American Humane .' 
to think. 



From the foregoing, the gut issue 
emerges. After three-quarters of a 
century, should humanitarians, the 
American Humane Association and 
other humane societies continue to be 
"rebuked" by veterinarians-to be 
told what they may think, say or do? 
We say no. Under the Constitution of 
the United States all citizens have the 
right not only to free speech but to 
their own beliefs, and they may not be 
deprived of these rights. We urge all 
humanitarians and all humane 
societies, including the American 
Humane Association, to stand up and 



not submit to the "rebukes" of 
veterinarians for another three-quar- 
ters of a century. 

Many humane societies, national 
and local, have leaned on veterinari- 
ans for many years for advice and 
guidance in developing and pursuing 
their own programs, so that now they 
may be quite atrophied. They may not 
have the strength or the will or even 
the knowledge to function without the 
support of veterinarians. There is 
little rank and file humanitarians can 
do to prevent the societies they 
support from quietly continuing to 



expunge the influence of 



annual and other meetings of the 
societies they support; whether these 
societies are associated with veteri- 
narians in any way, for any purpose, 
other than the delivery of medical 



i and should give their support 
to those societies that can clearly 
demonstrate they are in no way allied 



medical s 



to believe that 
humane societies need the "expert" 
advice of veterinarians so far as 
laboratory animals are concerned. 
Even the best-intentioned veterinari- 
an can't speak out about laboratory 
animals. To do so would be to violate 
the policies of his "la bor union," the 
American Veterinary Medical 

Association, and would bring down 
upon his head the wrath of his own 
colleagues who are maiming, tortur- 
ing and killing laboratory animals. 
We ourselves know veterinarians who 
would like to speak out but dare not 
for fear of retaliation by their 
colleagues. 

The commonly-held belief that 
veterinarians are the protectors and 
guardians of animals, especially 
laboratory animals, is a myth. The 
published literature reveals quite the 
opposite. For those who want to get an 
idea of what verinarians themselves 
do to laboratory animals, please ask 
us for a copy of our report on Animal 
Models of Agony and Death, the 
Radiation Killings. We will glady 
send a copy free upon request. 



l and all those other societies who 
have allied themselves with veterina- 

of the sharp conflict of inter est that 
exists between the objectives of 
and what most people 



&gt; undertake to do the 
work for which they were organized. 
Animal experimentation today can't 
really be called research; it has 
become a factor in commerce and 
industry to create jobs and generate 
profits for those who supply the 
animals, animal feed and equipment. 
Furthermore, animal experimenta- 
tion itself is undergoing a rapid and 
radical change. Where once it was 
surgery, burnings, chemical and 
radiation killings, etc., in the past few 
years a new dimension has been 
added: psychobiology. Unlike vivi- 
section, in which animals die or are 
eventually killed for autopsy, in 
psychobiology the animals are tor- 
mented and tortured throughout their 
entire lives, sometimes in combina- 
tion with various mutilations or other 
trauma. Curiously, psychobiology, in 
which intensive and ingenious efforts 
are made to drive laboratory animals 
insane, is routinely called "animal 
behavior." But in fact it is behavior 
modification, known in humans, 
particularly in prisoners of war, as 
brain-washing. 



The time is long past due for all 
humane societies to observe basic 
ethical standards of conduct and 
practices, to root out conflict of 
interest from their structures, and to 
perform the work they were organiz- 



the only bargaining power she has in 
this area is the power to withhold a 
divorce. 

The old system required the two 
spouses to agree to a divorce, but 
under no-fault, only one need show 
incompatibility or irreconcilable dif- 
ferences. The court then decides 
what, if any, property settlement, 
alimony or child support the wife 
receives. This, in turn, depends upoln 
the predilections of the judge.

the National Organization for Women 
are fighting to ensure that no-fault 
divorce laws are accompanied by 
iron-clad legal guarantees for the 
economic well-being of the dependent 
spouse and the children. 

When Gov. Mandel walKea out on 
his wife in July, 1973, his first offer of 
financial support was reported as 
$6,250 a year. The budgeting by which 
this sum could maintain the life-style 
enjoyed as First Lady of Maryland 
was not made clear. 

Barbara refused the offer-and 
refused to leave the Executive 
Mansion. When she did exit, six 
months later, her lawyer had 
negotiated a six-figure settlement. If 
no-fault passes in Maryland, a 
judge will ultimately decide her 
reward for 32 years on the campaign 
trail. 

Barbara Mandel will probably 
make out OK. As the wife (ex or 
otherwise) of a public figure, she can 
always write a book; sell her story to 
the women's magazines, or hit the 
lecture circuit. Less fortunate are the 
thousands of honiemakers, who 
despite years of faithful service, find 
themselves dumped in middle age 
for a younger, less work-worn 
woman. In most states the posses- 
sions held in the wife's name alone 
are incontestably hers. That usually 
includes only her hope chest.

code-named the Plumbers.

General Telephone of Indiana for a 
record of all long distance calls to 
Stown. This proved futile as all of the 
suspects live in Fort Wayne. It was 
reliably reported that the unit did find 



out where Mr. Stown orders his suits 

The controversy revolves around 
a recent story by Mr. Stown to the

to do whatever was necessary to bring 
the bounder to justice in the name of 
"University Security." The newly

On the Way Out 



SOFT ROCK MAN 

Rick McDonnell is preparing to publish in a 
professional journal, The Journal of Paleontology. This 
would not be too unusual if Rick had an M.A. or Phd. after 
his McConnell. Yet he is now only a' freshman in the geology 
department here at Regional Campus. 

Doing the unusual is usual for the Churubusco High 
graduate. It all began in his high school sophmore year 
when a rock club he belonged to took a field trip to the 
Woodburn Quarry. That was the day that Rick met his first 
piece of placoderm. In fine fossil plate was preserved part 
of the form of a five-foot fish that swam in what is now 
Woodburn's quarry four hundred million years ago. Rick 
kep! making return trips to his digs, and worked on filling 
out the missing sections. He averages about one good plate 
per trip, even yet As a visible result of his efforts, he now 
has a reconstruction of a Devonian placoderm three 
quarters complete from fossil finds. 

Lasl year his project was already so finely developed 
that Rick McConnell took a high place in the Earth and 
Space Sciences division of the finals of the National Science 
Fair held in San Diego. Unfortunately, a hard rock man 
topped that division by dint of discovering two new minerals 
to compete with Rick's one old fish.

make it their major there is no class crowding. There are 
only about 3,500 professional astronomers in the U.S. 

If you want to make a name for yourself in the skies, 
though, according to Vandenberg , your best chance is not 
to turn pro. Most comets and bodies discovered out there in 
the universe and labeled with such diverse names have 
been spotted by amateur star studiers, who have staked 
their claims and stenciled their names on sky maps. 

Kohoutek, the comet of Christmas past, however, was 
one exception to the amateur rule. Lubos Kohoutek, a 
professional astronomer, discovered this really far out 
flash with the aid of a Schmitt Camera. Even when you 
make a name for yourself professionally, though, it still 
doesn't make it pronounceable. Vandenberg recalls Dr. 
Edmonson of the I.U. Astronomy Dept. in Bloomington 
helping professional astronomers at an AURA nedeting 
with the pronunciation of that name that can be half 
sneezed, half said — Kohoutek.

"We're number 1! We're number l!" chanted the 

Anderson Indian spectators in the final game of the Fort 
Wayne Semi-State. "Defense! Defense!" encouraged the 
Northrop fans. 

Anderson had reason to claim being number one, as at 



undefeated, and last year IIr-y had made it to the final four 
before succumbing to South Bend Adams. They boasted 
that they were the best. Their fans thought so, and their 
players obviously did also. After their afternoon victory 
over Elkhart Memorial, they just calmly walked off of the 
floor like the game never had needed to be played. 

Northrop fans had reason to encourage defense. The 
team had not allowed any team to score over 70 points 
against them this year. Their defensive average was a 
remarkable at) But Ihe question was whether their defense 
could hold Anderson's potent offense, which had averaged a 
fantastic 82 points a ball game. 

Anderson had beaten half of their opponents by 30 
points or more, and their schedule was supposively much 
lonelier than Fort Wayne Northrop's. They had their 82 
point offensive average, but they hadn't played Northrop. 
Their record was unblemished, but they hadn't played 
Northrop. 

Last year in the final game of the semi-state Anderson 
whipped Northrop 92-69. Both teams just about had their 
entire first fives returning, but Northrop had lost their best 



i remembered their t 
Northrop last year, and didn't seem a bit concerned ab out 
them this year. 
The final game was finished, and it wasn't the Anderson 

Indians who were laughing. The fact is they were crying. 
Mike Muff had given Anderson's best big man i Marshall &gt; 
such a hard time, that when he fouled out he went over to 
the bench and pouted. Marshall found out that the Northrop 



Northrop proved their definite superiority, and 
THEY, not Anderson, will be the northeastern Indiana 
representatives in the 1974 IHSAA State Tournament. 

The excitement, thrills, disappointments, and tensions 
of Hoosier Hysteria reaches its climax at Bloomington the 
23rd, and who wouldn't want to be part of the state finals! 
How many past, present, and future basketball players 
have dreamed of making it to the final four? Only four out of 
ov er 400 teams reach the summit of high school basketball, 
which continues to be one of the greatest honors in hoosier 
athletics. 

Fort Wayne, a city with a great following for high 
school basketball, seldom makes it into the final four. North 
Side was beaten by the Keller-led Indianapolis Washington 
squad in 1965, and* had to be satisfied as runner-ups. South 
Side with now professional Willie Long reached the final 
four in 1967, but were beaten in the afternoon tilt. 

Now, seven years later Fort Wayne has entered the 
picture once again. Fort Wayne Northrop, only in its third 
year of athletic competition, could be one of the toughest 
teams to ever come out of Fort Wayne. With a tenacious 
defense, and absolutely superb re bounding, the Bruins 
have won 24 games in a row, and lost only to South Bend 
Adams during the season. They were beaten 53-50 at South 
Bend. 

Even though Northrop has a poor free throw shooting 
team, only hitting about 52 per cent at the line for the 
season, and have no high scoring guards, they use their 
height advantage and their great 1:2 punch of Walter 
Jordan and Mike Muff to their advantage. Jim Wimbley, 
who along with Muff is one of the best rebounders in the 
state, is often joined by 6'9" Maurice Drinks, Muff, Jordan, 
and quick Tom Madden in the starting line up. Willie 
Spencer, Tony Casso, and Dennis Hetrick also see frequen t 

The other six members of the squad haven't seen a 
whole lot of action this year, but they are credited by coach 
Bob Dille for the success of the team. It has been the 
competition of Suttle, Klein, Fredrick, Putt, Beck, and Hale 
in practice that has helped the first five gel into one of the 
best high school teams in the state. 

Northrop will probably be the favorite in the state finals 
&gt; they defeated number one Anderson, but they still 



lable them to stretch 



and hopefully their n 
that streak to 26. 

I have a brother on the team, which has drawn my 
interest more than it would have otherwise, but I think it is 
an honor for Fort Wayne to have a representative in the 
state finals after seven long years. All three state games

MEANWHILE IN THE COLLEGE AND-PRO RANKS 

The college and pro action seems relatively 
unimportant now since Fort Wayne has a representative in 
Hoosier Hysteria, but several Indiana college teams have 



j that deserves at least a line ( 



) of 



^cognition. 

The Indiana Hoosiers. even though still disappointed 
lat they didn't make it to the NCAA finals, narrowly got by 
u'ir first two opponents and then finally played sump ball 
s they whipped Southern California for the championship 
v NCAA tourney The attendance was very poor 
1 there have already been rumors 



recognition for the Hoosiers. However, the vast 
improvement of Kent Benson throughout the year was 
responsible for much of Indiana's success. They will have 
their entire squad back next year, so they might get their 
chance in the NCAA a year from now. 

Purdue had hardly any trouble at all in getting past 
favored North Carolina in the NIT. The Bolilers pressured 
Carolina into making 33 errors, something that will lose a 
ball game every time. Purdue plays Hawaii next, and 
hopefully they will be able to avenge an earlier loss in the 
season. If Purdcue plays the ball they are capable of 
playing, it wouldn't surprise me if they brought a NIT 
trophy home to Indiana. 

UCLA, North Carolina State, Marquette, and Kansas 
are the survivors of a hectic week of NCAA tournament 
action. Notre Dame bowed out quietly, while Dayton nearly 
upset UCLA behind 36 points by Sylvester. Meanwhile, 
Michigan completely blew their game against Marquette as 
Campy Russel threw up two of the worst shots I have ever 
seen in the last fifteen seconds of that game. 

UCLA and North Carolina State will meet for the second 
time this year. If you remember correctly, the Bruins 
pulled away in the first contgest, as Keith Wilkes held 
Thompson, the fantastic Ail-American leaper, a ways below 
his 26 point average. 

Thompson will have to be more effective if State has 
any expec tations of defeating the mighty Bruins.
