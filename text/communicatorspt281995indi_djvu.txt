Patterson challenges 
university and commu- 
nity to join together 

by Melissa Young-F lores 
News Editor 

Earlier this month Christine Patterson joined the uni- 
versity administrative staff as new director of the Office 
of Multicultural Services. 

According to Frank Borelli, vice chancellor of stu- 
dent affairs. Patterson's job ismultifaceted. 'The office 
will assist us with the recruitment and retention of stu- 
dents of color, contribute lo the university's diversity 
agenda and serve as an advocate for students of color." 
said Biti.Hi "I'm looking for some good things lo hap- 
pen." 

Patterson said she had deeply researched and 
explored the programs of IPFW before leaving 
Pennsylvania State University at University Park 
Pennsylvania "This is quite an impressive campus tbat

is land rich and has a lot of potential for growtb," said 
Pa Hereon. 

Patterson said she would like to see the tie between 
the university and the community grow "I would like to 
see this office more closely linked with the communi- 
ty." Patterson said. "We have a lot of resources to offer 
the community, and the com- 
munity has a lot lo offer us." 
According to Patterson, the 

community gives me universi- 
ty what it needs to succeed: 

students. The university in 

turn helps mold the students 

into leaders and returns them 

to the community. 

"I want lo By lo encourage 

students to pick IPFW as their 

first choice," said Patierson. 
Recruiting more diverse 

students, sucb as those of 

color, those with disabilities 

and those who come from 

other countries needs to be 

placed on the university's 



"If you can retain 
tne students you 

have, they 

become the best 

recruitment a 

university can 

have, " 

- Patterson 



from burner "It is aboul lime we put a forward thrust 



on them." said Patterson. 

Retention of current students is the best lool for 
recruitment. "If you can retain the students you have, 
they become the best recruitment a university can 
have," said Patierson. 

University climate is also a target issue for Patterson. 
Pallerson said the university needs lo 
maintain an environment thai is "wel- 
coming for all students, faculty and 
administrators. 

Patterson said the university should 
continue lo hire more women and peo- 
ple of color 

"II is an ongoing process we need to 
continue to address until we meei equi- 
ty," said Patterson " We always need to 
monitor ourselves." 

Patterson said she is disappointed by 
the lumoul at cultural evenls. "There 
wasn't a diverse body of students at the 
[J, Herman Blake] prcsenialion. The 
events are meant for the whole campus," 
said Patterson "We need to appreciate 
other cultures as a part of education."

Campus removes potential 
environmental hazard 



by Nol Beckley 
Editor 

Due to environmental con- 
cerns and complaints, IPFW 
has eliminated all four 
mimeograph (ditto) machines 
on campus. One faculty mem- 
ber, Anne Colbert, coordina- 
tor of the journalism depart- 
ment, was affected by the 
tainted fumes. 

Don Kaiier, director of the 
physical plant, said, "A con- 
cern was expressed about a 
volatile chemical which may 
have not been healthy " 
Katter also said the chemical 
would only affect people 
directly in the vicinity of the 
exhaust tube 

Colbert said her skin was 
irritated and had trouble 
breathing while the ditto 
machines were in use. 

According to Renee 
Escboff, occupational health 
and safety specialist, the pos- 
sible side effects of the 
exhaust fumes from the 
machine are drowsiness and 
irritation of the skin, eyes, 
nose and tbroal. 



Accompanying those effects 
could be mild headaches and 
nausea. Tbe chemical in ques- 
tion is methyl alcohol, which 
is expelled into the air 
through the exhaust port of 
the mimeograph. 

"We knew the machines 
needed io be gotten rid of." 
Escboff said Sbe said the 
machines are used most 
extensively around the end of 
ibe semester for teacher 
analysis. 

"I was impressed tbey 
moved as quickly as tbey 
did," Colbert said. 

According to the 
"Directorate of Technical 
Support," published by 
Occupational Heallb and 
Safety Administration 
(OSHA), acceptable levels of 
methyl alcohol are 200 parts 
per million (ppm) parts of air. 
Escboff tested tbe methyl 
alcohol leveLs on July 26. Tbe 
level in Neff 240 was 1000 
ppm and in Neff 351 the level 
was 400 ppm. The mimeo- 
graph machine in Classroom 
Medical was removed, even 



Ihougb tesls placed Ihe 
meihyl alcohol level under 
OSHA's standards. 

On Friday. Sepl. 22. tbe 
last mimeograph machine 
was removed from Neff Hall. 
Escboff said several of Ihe 
departmeni chairs resisted the 
removal of the machines, 
because their respective 
departments had paid for 
them and would receive no 
compensation Some depart- 
ment chairs expressed con- 
cern tbat switching to copy- 
ing machines would cost 
much more per copy and 
would be less convenient. 
According lo Eschoff, print- 
ing services said tbe prices 
were about tbe same The 
supplier bought the machines 
back. 

Colbert said she has asth- 
ma and had part of a lung 
removed during childhood 
"I'm nol set up (o deal with 
certain conditions." she said. 

Tbe administration has 
supported eliminating ihe 
machines from the beginning. 
according to Escboff. 



News Analysis 



I Chomsky to condemn corporate media 



byJefTBrunst 
Staff Reporter 



In tbe former Soviet Union, they 
used lo deal with dissidents by shipping 
them off lo gulags. In the contemporary 
United Stales, some maintain, ihe pre- 
ferred method of dealing with dissidents 
is io simply exile their views from the 
impressionable minds of the public at 
large. 

This Friday, from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m.. 
tbe views of one of those homegrown 
intellectual exiles will be granted a trav- 
el pass, when PBS Channel 39 airs 
"Manufacturing Conseni: Noam 
Chomsky and the Media. 

Noam Chomsky is an MIT linguistics 
professor who has written extensively 
aboul corporate control of mass media 
in the United States In an activist career 



tbat spans well over 30 years, Chomsky 
has also critically addressed numerous 
political and economic issues, ranging 
from the Vietnam War to NAFTA. 

This free-style documentary incorpo- 
rates recent as well as archival footage 
of Chomsky in action. Through excerpts 
of his interviews, lectures and debates 
with political and media luminaries, 
Chomsky's arguments concerning the 
functions of corporaie media in our 
society arc given a fair hearing. 

Chomsky contends that the political 
and economic world view projected by 
corporaie media generally conforms to 
the interests of concentrated wealth and 
power in our society — the same wealth 
and power which owns media corpora- 
tions, subsidizes their existence through 
advertisement revenue and supplies 
media with news and opinion through 



government and business channels. 

Chomsky maintains thai mass media, 
in addition (o entertaining and inform- 
ing, has a propaganda function in osten- 
sibly democratic societies: public opin- 
ion is effectively "manufactured" by big 
media corporations that determine what 
will or won't be pari of the "reality" 
they define. 

In ihis film Chomsky presents evi- 
dential comparisons in support of this 
view, like the disparate treatment by the 
U.S. press of genocide in Cambodia and 
East Timor Mass slaughter in 
Cambodia, conducted by a regime in 
conflict with corporate and US Slate 
Department interests, received extensive 
coverage and expressions of outrage by 
print and broadcast media in the U.S. 
Easi Timor's mass slaughter, conducted 
by an Indonesian regime in compliance 



ill) corporate and Stale Department 
interests, was barely mentioned 

Chomsky himself may be a testament 
to his own institutional theories. He is 
generally excluded from commercial 
and government TV news and opinion 
programs Chomsky's writings appear 
in small progressive publications like 
"The Nation" and "Z Magazine" bul 
they are not welcome in Ihe Op/Ed 
pages of The New York Times or other 
large dailies Nor are bis books wel- 
comed by big corporate publishers 
When a critique he co-wroie on U.S. 
foreign policy was published by a 
Warner subsidiary in 1973, for example, 
all 10,000 copies of the book were sub- 
sequently destroyed after a conservative 
Warner executive caught wind of their

Office for Students with Disabilities serves as advocate 



by Rebecca Kotnlg 
Chief Reporter 

Class after class, college is stressful enough for any- 
one It is a never ending flood of papers, quizzes, and 
tests. Having a learning disability or other handicap 
makes already difficult classes next 10 impossible. 
Studenls with disabilities often have to work much 
harder tban their counterparts and deserve to have 
some help so they may accomplish goals equivalent to 
everyone else's. 

Tbe office for Students with Disabilities, established 
in the 1980' s, has the purpose of helping these stu- 
denis. The office provides adaptive equipment and ser- 
vices for studenis with disabilities. They have 
machines which help the students over come complica- 
tions, such as one which reads text inserted into it 
Margie Guthrie and Randy Borst. who work in the 
office, arc trained, licensed counselors helping students 
deal with emotional problems A large amount of their 
time is spent realizing students strengths and encourag- 
ing them 10 use those qualities as much as possible. 

"1 think we arc fortunate lo have an exceptional 
coordinator for the office that provides those services 
Randy Borst is always on top of all the issues. He is an 
exceptionally fine advocate for studenis for disabilities. 
His suggestions arc always on the mark and I think 



those students are fortunate to have someone like him 
represent them." said Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs, Frank Borelli. 

Visual, hearing, mobility and manual disabilities 
are probably the most easily noticed types of disabili- 
ties, but tbey are only a few 
found at IPFW Learning dis- 
; are the most common 
id are often difficult to 
detect, even for the 
person with the dis- 
ability. Internal dis- 
orders, such as dia- 
betes, falls under 
the classification 
of a disability. 
Psychiatric 
disorders, 
such as post 
traumatic dis- 
tress disorder, often 
plague people. Post trau- 
matic distress disorder is caused 
by severe abuse or trauma in a per- 
sons life such as war. Disabilities can be a 
wide range of other problems, including brain damage 
and alcoholism. 




Corresponding directly with faculty is another way 
which the office for Students with Disabilities assists 
the students. Students are allowed to take proctor tests 
in the center, which may allow them more time and 
assistance on the test. According to Guthrie, most pro- 
fessors are eager to assist these students. 

Working with this office, students are able to 
accomplish things, which otherwise would simply have 
been out of reach "We provide alternative ways for 
students to meet their academic goals," said Borst. 

Borst also deals with many employment issues on 
campus that might effect workers with disabilities. He 
coordinates with a nondiscrimination act called the 
Americans with Disabilities Act Often questions are 
referred to bim. 

Despite all the services provided 
by the center for Students with 
Disabilities, their facilities could still 
be improved upon. In addition to 
Borst and Guthrie, only one more 
person, the secretary, works with the 
center. That means these three dedi- 
cated facility members are working 
with about 120 students on campus 
who are known to have disabilities. 

Even worse, the office is divided 
into two rooms Borst and the recep- 



tionist, who students usually come lo first, are located 
with the Multicultural Services in Walb UN C-uihnc 
and the equipment are located in Walb 218 

While Walb does have a working elevator and a 
service elevator, which can be used as a backup, com- 
mon sense would indicate that an office primarily for 
students wilh disabilities, many of whom have visual 
and mobility disabilities, would be located in a first 
floor suite. 

Disabled Student Services may be moved to the first 
floor of Walb or another building, upon the completion 
of the Science Building Another possibility Ls that the 
planned of Walb could provide more space on the first 
floor for this little known, but extremely vital office.

African Americans males march on Washington D.C. 



by Rebecca Koenlg 
Chief Reporter 

Oct. 12 could conceivably bring 
over a million African American 
men into the streets of Washington 
D.C, marching for the political 
strength of African American Men. 
"The Million Man March" changed 
from a dream to reality when Louis 
Farrakhan, the Leader of the Nation 
of Islam, combined efforts with 
Rev Benjamin Chavis, the former 
director of the NAACP The object 
of the march is to bring African 
American men together to show 
that they must not be forgotten or 
ignored. The march is supported by 
the Central Labor Council and by 
FAIR. 

The independent candidate for 
the First District City Council posi- 



tion, lacqueline Dowdell, is spon- 
soring a scholarship to attend the 
march. Dowdell is working with 
Single Mothers Against Crime and 
Killers, of our Children (SMACK). 
The scholarship is open to any 
African American men, over the 
age of eighteen, who are currently 
enrolled in college Applicants will 
need a current copy of their tran- 
scripts. More information can be 
obtained by contacting Dowdell at 
744-2214. 

In addition to marching for 
unity, the Nation of [slam has 
planned other activities for those in 
attendance. At the march, a search 
for black fathers will take place. 
Participants will also be encouraged 
to register to vote. The Nation of 
Islam is campaigning to register 
eight million new voters. The lead- 



ers are hoping to demonstrate their 

political unhappincss and power to 
the Republican and Democrat par- 
lies. One possible outcome is a 
new government party, which is 
likely lo show support for more 
common people and less for big 
government and big business. 

Support for "The Million Man 
March" varies, according to area 
and from person to person. Possibly 
more support could be found if 
women were not strongly discour- 
aged to participate in the march- 
Muslim women are traditionally 
without power, and "The Million 
Man March" is no exception 
Women are encouraged to stay 
home from work or school and 
spend the day praying. Some feel 
that women should be encouraged 
to participate.

College radio station would add to whole experience 



You may not have noticed it yet, 
but you have lived through a revo- 
lution of sorts. Fort Wayne now has 
an "Alternative" radio station that 
plays what used lo be called "col- 
lege rock." This means we are now 
exposed to one of the things that 
makes college a place like none 
other: independent music, if you 
will For those of you who have 
missed it, but desperately want to 
hear it, the dial numbers are 96.3. 

One of the many problems with 
a commuter campus, and we could 
name many, is the lack of a stu- 
dent-run college radio station. 
Some of the best bands — R.E.M., 
the B-52's and Hooiie and the 
Blowfish just to name an obvious 
few — were accidentally discov- 
ered by college radio stations. 
Without one our local talents have 



little chance of gaining a hometown 
audience. 

Remember back, way back, to 
the fifties when Rock and Roll was 
first taking residence in our (par- 
ent's) hearts. This new formal was 
causing quite a stir between the 
youth and its elders. In the end the 
beginning of Rock and Roll defined 
a generation, brought out new and 
talented artists and gave kids an 
exciting way of expressing them- 
selves Few would disagree that 
Rock music has changed America 
for the belter. 

College radio can provide the 
same sense of discovery and indi- 
viduality The music played is not 
found on any commercial radio sta- 
tion. Where in Fort Wayne will you 
bear Goo-Goo Dolls, Sarah 
MacLaughlin or Love Spit Love? 



Answer: no wbere. For a true music 
alternative, we need a college radio 
station. 

IPFW once had its own station, 
which has now evolved into WBNI 
We still have the necessary equip- 
ment and starling one would cost 
[ii-i 5500. But sources, namely a 
professor here on campus, (ell us 
that it is Purdue West Lafayette thai 
keeps us from having a radio sta- 
tion, a.k.a. a learning experience 
What a shock I 

This goes back to the statement 
heard time and lime again that 
IPFW is lacking the totality of the 
whole college experience. The dif- 
ference in this case is thai we have 
the resources and the students will- 
ing 10 pull off ihe task We current- 
ly have 78 students who are study- 
ing in the radio and television com- 



munication field. That is to say, at 
least 78 undergraduate students 
could gain first hand experience of 
■he media profession. Purdue is 
withholding this learning experi- 
ence from those 78 students This 
number does not include the num- 
ber of students who may benefit 
from the experience of a college 
radio station, i.e. accounting stu- 
dents, advertising students, man- 
agerial students, etc. 

We put this challenge to you: If 
starting a radio station on this cam- 
pus interests you, then call up 
Chancellor Michael Wanell at 481- 
6301 and express your feelings on 
this issue. Lei's show him and 
Ralph Nader thai IPFW students 
can be civil. And by the way... tell 
him the Communicator sent you. 



What's in a phrase? 




Forward 



"You 
know, one of my 
best friends is a 
heterosexual. I 
treat htm like 
any other 

friend. We do a 
lot together: we 
get drunk, 
watch movies. 
shoot pool. I 
ihmk of him as 
just another 
friend. It 

doesn't bother me thai he's 
straight. Just as long as he doesn't 
flaunt it." 

"I wish all of the hetero's would 
be sent to an island and be ban- 
ished there forever ." 

"I don 't mind straiglu people, as 
long as they act gay in public. " 

"How do you tell a heterosexual 
from an imbecile 9 The imbecile 
■ knows to match their shoes and 
belts." 

"Cancer is God's way of pun- 
ishing the straight people for all of 
the sin they've caused. Believe you 
me. if they hadn 't raped, stolen and 



committed adultery, they woutdn 't 
be getting what they've got coming 
to them. " 

"I can't stand to see a man and 
a woman kissing in public 
Whatever they do in their bedroom 
is their business, but I shouldn't 
have to see it " 

"How can you tell a heterosexu- 
al from a raccoon 7 You can't 
because they are both always wear- 
ing brown." 

Believe it or not, these are dupli- 
cate phrases I have beard in refer- 
ence lo gay people. They don't 
sound so great when they apply lo 
you, do Ihey? While the resi of the 
world is trying desperately lo be 
politically correct, the gay commu- 
nity still has (o hear offensive com- 
menis. 

Think back to just three months 
ago, when Michael Jackson agreed 
lo change ihe lyrics to the song 
"They Don't Care Aboul Us." as an 
apology lo the Jewish community 
for using the word "kike." This was 
an acceptable apology and every- 
one was happy; yel, no one com- 
plains when people describe things 



as being "queer." 

1 remember working at a less- 
than-mediocre athletic club in town 
and having (o listen to the owner 
describe things in a negative way as 
being "queer." She would say, 
"Look ai thai outfit, it's so queer." 

The new one seems lo be using 
"gay" as an adjective for weird sit- 
uations. "Listening to alternative 
music is so gay " What is it you are 
trying to say when you say some- 
thing is gay? Are you using the 
original meaning, lo be happy, lo 
refer lo these things? 

I undersiand that some of you 
may not mean lo be offensive when 
you say these things, but you are 
As a favor to all of your gay friends 
and relatives, please think before 
you talk. What may not seem like a 
big deal lo you, may in fact hurt us 

Some of you do mean these 
things and are not afraid lo be 
openly homophobic aboul it I 
recently ran into a student wearing 
a shirt thai said "Sorry Faggot, dix 
are for cbix " Of course, once this 
he-man mei me face lo face, he 
hadn't the gall to confront me or 



vocally veni his homophobia. Now, 
if this stud's bad shin said "Sorry 
Nigger, while girls are for free 
men," you can place a sure bel that 
he would have been frowned on by 
many people at this campus. As il 
was gays this particular shirt was 
bashing, it went unnoticed. In fact, 
I bet the model of this tacky fashion 
statement was placed on a mantel 
for his comedy and banter. 

Sebastian Bach. lead screamer 
for ibe musically impaired Skid 
Row, once was chastised for wear- 
ing a shirt thai said, "AIDS: kills 
fags dead." He apologized for this 
only because be did not condone 
making fun of tbe death of a loved 
one, noi because he offended over 
len percent of the population Nol 
lhat gays haven't had ihe last laugh: 
when was the last time you saw a 
Skid Row video on MTV? 

I have faith in all of you We 
have moved away from using ihe 
phrase, "I Jewed him down," and I 
am sure lhai we as a nation can 
learn lo be p.c. to gays. Thai's 
politically correct for those of you 
with strange imaginations.

Commentary 



Questions, no answers 



by Jacqueline Dowdtll 
Guest Columnist 

Human life is precious 
and deserving of legal recognition 
and protection, The decision to 
punish someone Tor committing 
murder, whether il wa.i an accident 
or not, cannot he determined by the 
individual's race or economic sta- 
tus, or even on public sentiment 
To do so, would invite discrimina- 
tion in the criminal justice system. 

With this in mind, did 
race or economic status play in the 
prosecution's decision aboul the 
death of Tiger Dowdcll? When 
Tiger was murdered, the scales of 
justice began its balancing act. But, 
as weights are added, with public 
sentiment on one side and law on 
the other, wbo killed Tiger 
becomes less important The deter- 
mining factors become: how dam- 
aging il could be for one's career, 
and how much are we willing to 
pay to prepare an adult facility for 
a twelve-year old male. There must 
be more we can do than just watch 
the scales. 

Indiana says young killers 
can be waived to an adult court. 
But what happens when the courts 
are not prepared to carry out such a 
law. The prosecutor must become 
the eyes for the lady of justice and 
begin to balance her scales. 

Justice is what the family 



members of the murdered victim 
wants, and is the responsibility of 
the prosecutor's office Many ques- 
tions go unanswered in the murder 
of Tiger 

■ How many weapons were found 
at the scene? 

• What weapon was used to kill 
Tiger? 

• Is that weapon in hands of the 
police? 

• Did both individuals confess, or 
did both implicate the other? 

• Who murdered Tiger? 

• Why was Tiger murdered? 
These questions go unanswered 
because of decisions made by the 
prosecutor's office. The only two 
questions that seem to warrant 
answers from the prosecutor's 
office are: ( 1 ) How do we foot the 
bill to house a juvenile? and (2) 
What effect will a waiver of a 
twelve-year old to adult court have 
on those in the prosecutor's office? 

This is an election year 
and an arrest may give the appear- 
ance the community is safe But 
the prosecutor knows just because 
things appear right. "It ain't neces- 
sarily so." A criminal may be sit- 
ting next to your child in school, 
waiting for the opportunity to mur- 
der again. Will taxpayers demand 
more from its criminal justice sys- 
tem? Who killed Tiger is the ques- 
tion.

by Terry Do ran 
Guest Columnist 

The other day I went into a store 
to buy a pair of running shoes. 
"These are the best," the young 
salesman assured me. holding up a 
pairofS80Nilr.es. 

I won't wear Nikes," I informed 
him. "I wouldn'i wear those if you 
gave them to me. I wouldn't wear 
Nikes if you paid me!" 

He asked why 

"Because Nike is a multination- 
al corporation that exploits its 
workers," I replied 

The young man gave me a puz- 
zled look What red-blooded 
American would not buy some- 
thing as a matter of principle? It 
was not only stupid ( "Nikes are the 
best"), but down right un- 
American. 

A few days later I was at the run 
jane run sofiball tournament. There 
they were, hundreds of women of 
all shapes, sizes, ages and back- 
grounds, coming together for a 
common cause: sisterhood. As I 
wandered the grounds. 1 noticed 
their gear: Nike shoes, Nike jack- 
ets, Nike hats. Nikes shirts. Nike 
shorts.. NIKE, NIKE. NIKE. 

I thought of all this, as I read the 
review of Ralph Nader's talk at 
IPFW. I thought about Nader's 
warning that mullinational compa- 
nies exert too much influence on 
American beliefs, and I remem- 
bered the comments from some of 
the citizens in attendance. "Gosh, I 
didn't know that." referring 10 the 
power these giant corporations 
exercise over us. I thought of 
Nader's consistent implication that 
Americans are ignorant of the 
forces around us; if only we knew. 
we would take action against it. So 
allow me to add a few siories and 
see if aiming people with a few 
facts can change their behavior. 

Let's start with Nike They pay 
the mostly (80 percent) female 
workers in their factory in 



Indonesia S 1 .03 per day. 

Jeffrey Ballinger wrote in 
"Harper's" magazine: 

" that amount, which works out 
to just under 14 cents per hour, is 
less than the Indonesian govern- 
ment's figure for 'minimum physi- 
cal need.' A recent International 
Labor Organization survey found 
that 88 percent of Indonesian 
women working at (this) wage rate 
are malnourished. ." 

Sadisah. one of the workers, 
makes $37.46 per month (based on 
six days a week, ten hours a day), 
which is about half the cost of a 
pair of the sneakers she makes. Put 
another way. the labor costs for 
that pair of S80 Nike sneakers the 
young man wanted to sell me is 
approximately 12 cenls. No wonder 
Nike executives make fortunes. 
Michael Jordan makes S20 million 
per year for his Nike ads. Nike, of 
course, would defend its practices 
by claiming these women in 
Indonesia wouldn't have a job at 
all, were it not for Nike. 

Take a close look a tennis 
match. The players are a walking 
billboard for Nike and other com- 
panies. In fact, just aboul all major 
sporting events in this country are 
smeared with the logos of multina- 
tional companies. I have a modest 
proposal for Nike, its executives. 
Michael Jordan and the other ath- 
letes: Let them live in the shanty 
where Sadisah and other factory 
workers live. Then, we will see 
how important and glamorous they 
feel. 

Now that you run jane run play- 
ers know, do as I did — lake every 
piece of Nike clothing and throw 
them into the trash, and refuse to 
buy any more Nike products until 
they change their practices. Let's 
hope the salespeople will soon 
build a big bonfire of Nike gear, in 
their parking lots. 

Meanwhile, you and I can roast. 
somemarshmallows... Nike-less. 



Sexism in Kettler? 

You're kidding 



As I was conversing with a cer-

of this enclave 



My staff of 1 1 people is formed 
mosdy of women and not a single 
one is a secretary. Can Chancellor 
Wartcll say anything close to that 
about the exclusive club known as 
the administration. 

Nearly every non-paid staff 
reporter or writer is female. 

Unlike the chancellor. 1 have not 
had a mass departure of women 
from my office like the one (which 
rivaled the Old Testament Exodus) 
he witnessed when he assumed the 
chancellor'sihrone.

asked me if 1 wanted to bum her 
and at the moment I was a bit 
frightened so il seemed like a 
favorable thought for self-preserva-

As the witches flounced away 
toward the library vowing to end 
racism and sexism on this campus 
by not reading The Communicator, 
I realized a better plan to extermi- 
nate sexism and racism at IPFW 
would start with investigating the 
personnel practices of Chancellor 
Michael Wartcll. My personnel 
practices are markedly different, 
for example: 

I have never humiliated; any 
man or j Woman oh my staff. As of 
two weeks ago, I doubt the 
Chancellor could make that claim

Women getting bad rap 



by Abba La Roche 
Staff Writer 

Clad in a White 
Sox jersey, canvas 
sneakers, jeans sag- 
ging below ihe 
hips, with two afro i 
puffs positioned on 
the sides of his head. 
Rapper Snoop Doggy Dog 
emerges on stage bellow- 
ing the words, 
don't love then 
hoes Bitch ar 
it's like that!" 

Rap songs like these have 
bit mainstream and are fre- 
quently heard booming from 
a car, Listen closely and the" 
songs might not sound so cool, 
especially if you are a woman 

Just what kind of rep arc 
women receiving from the rap 
industry? 

According to rappers like 
Snoop. Ice Lube, 4-Tay and Ihe 
Sixty Nine Boys, women ire noth- 
ing more than a hoe, bitch, trick or 
some form of crude sex object. 
Rapper 4-Tay, with his latest 
release entitled "Don't fight the 
feelin, she's a sell out," sings the 
lines. "Just cause I called you 




Bitch, Don't mean I don't love ya." 
Is this song giving permission for a 
male to call his girlfriend a bitch 
without really meaning any harm? 
Is this the type of language soci- 
ety wants to teach the 
younger generations of 
women? They may not real- 
ize that calling a woman a 
bitch is a form of verbal 
abuse. 
Some of these rappers 
tsist that this kind of 
female bashing is a 
form of expression; 
these demeaning remarks only 
refer to those who fit the 
description, Yei, what about 
Ihe notion that each individual 
deserves respect no matter 
his/her race or sex? 

The African American woman 
has even been portrayed by a dog 
on a CD cover. Regardless of 
whether or not the music is pur- 
chased, (he fact of the matter is no 
one deserves to be belittled because 
of her sex. 

Women have come so far and 
accomplished so much thai ii would 
be shameful if their struggle was 
done for nothing If one single 
woman requested that her 
boyfriimd not listen to or buy any 



song that degrades women, she 
would be taking a step toward abol- 
ishing the songs rappers produce. 

Regardless of the names women 
are called, their crown can never be 
taken. A woman brought Snoop 
Doggy into the world. It is up 10 
women to put a stop to bis music 

The bottom line is don't buy 
female-bashing music, don't listen 
to it and don't accept anything 
degrading 10 women. No profit can 
be made without a purchase, and 
nothing can be heard without a lis- 
tener. 



...the fact of the mat 

is no one deserves 

to be beiittfed 

because 

of her 

sex

"The moment one definitely

Are these serendipitous happen-

Compared lo today's movies, 
box office hits of the 30's and 40's 
seem like antiques. Many of our 
grandparents enjoyed classic 
black and wbite movies like "Boys 
Town," "Babes on Broadway," and 
"The Little Princess." 

When our grannies and pappies 
were young sprouts die best Tinsel 
Town stars displayed not only 
beauty and acting ability, but also 
possessed a song bird's voice and 
ihe grace of a swan. 

Now many classic movies have 
been colorized; for some classic 
movie buffs the "improvements" 
are a desecration. 

Tumer Classic Movies, howev- 
er, has decided to save the tradi- 
tional movie watchers beloved 
flicks and show tunes. Although 
the movies themselves are not 
being re -re I eased, the soundtracks 




of four classic Mickey Rooney and 
Judy Garland flicks have been pre- 
served. 

The luncs of "Strike Up the 
Band." "Babes on Broadway." 
"Girl Crazy" and "Babes in Anns" 
have been recaptured in a collec- 
tion of four compact discs. Now it 
is available in music stores with 
the suggested retail price of 
564.98. A 57 page book filled with 
pictures of the pair, the featured 
movies and pin-up advertisements 



accompanies the albums. 

For old-movie nuts this collec- 
tion is a godsend. The lively luncs 
light up any day and almost pro- 
voke ihe clumsiest of souls to try 
to imitate the graceful steps of 
Garland and Rooney. Garland's 
sweet ballads also offer a nice 
break to the dance tunes. 

Turner Classic Movies/Rhino 
Music included several musical 
pieces which were removed from 
the original movie soundtracks. 
The never-released songs are a 
pleasant surprise and offer an 
opportunity lo explore die relative- 
ly unknown culture of the early 
twentieth century. 

Although this collection may 
noi be for everyone, especially 
those who have never experienced 
a classic black and white musical 
flick, the collection has captured 
an unforgettable era of hisiory that 
should be experienced at 
least once.

Mexico in the 20th century 

Art exhibit shows eras in Mexican history 



by Jennifer Oney 
SUIT Writer 

The most comprehensive exhibi- 
tion of Mexican an to travel outside 
the country bas to come to the 
IPFW campus. 

The exhibit, which is entitled 
MEXICO: SPLENDORS OF 
THIRTY CENTURIES is com- 
prised of four divisions. Each divi- 
sion of the show highlights a differ- 
ent era in Mexican History and 



illustrates bow the history influ- 
enced the art of that period. 

During the first era of what was 
to become known as Mexican - 
American culture, the Olmecs were 
the first people known to have pro- 
duced art. They made sculptures of 
large stone heads and also built 
stone cities as settings for public rit- 
uals. The Olmecs' themes 
expressed during this period, which 
began around 1000 B.C. and lasted 
for about 2500 years, inspired 
artists for centuries. 

The Mayan civilization emerged 
around the time of 100 B. C. Artists 
in the city of Tenochtitlan made 
their art more dramatic to impress 
the masses of their city Other cities 
in this time period are known for 
unlikely art such as burial urns, 
tombs and ball courts. Still others 
are known for hieroglyphs and stuc- 
co portraits Tenochtitlan was the 




last great city to rise before the Aztecs, the an changed Although 

Spanish conquest in 1521. the Aziecs struggled against the 

After the Spanish defeated the new culture, the new styles came to 



be accepted and incorporated into 
the an. which had been previously 
Indian art such as Mayan and 
Olmec. 

The colonial era paintings, sculp- 
tures and carvings look European in 
comparison to the an of the preced- 
ing centuries This is also known as 
the Baroque period (the lime from 
the 1600'siothe 1700's). 

By the I9th century the style had 
returned to the Indian flavor The 
exhibit includes 20th century 
murals by Jose Clemente Orozco 
and David Alfaro Siqueiros 

The exhibit runs from Sept. 20 
to Oct. 1 in the Fine Arts building 
and also includes paintings of 
Mayan ruins by Norman W. 
Bradley, Associate Professor of 
Fine Arts at IPFW Exhibit hours 
arc 9 a.m. to 6 p.m . Monday 
through Saturday and on Sundays, 
noon to 6 p.m. 




ESftft&amp;ftitiks Groov J stu ff m the tube 



by Nol Beckley 

Editor 

As your hand twitcbingly clutch- 
es the salsa-encrusted remote, your 
mind wanders through the channels 
as quick as your thumb flips. Never 
once do you stop on any channel for 
longer than 12 minutes You ask 
yourself. "Why aren't ihere any 
decent shows on late night televi- 
sion for us Jolt-guzzling insomni- 
acs?" (Maybe I have revealed a lit- 
tle too much information about 
myself) Instead of consulting our 
usual crew of experts/idiots, I 
decided I was mind numbed enough 
for an expedition into the late night 
world of reruns and syndication. 
Any student can do his or her own 
study; here is what you need: a 12 
pack of Jolt cola, three packs of 
Marlboro Menthols, one bag of 
Ranch Donlos, one bag of Grandma 



Shearer's Keitle Cooked Barbecue 
chips and nail clippers and an 
emery board for commercials. A 
nice manicure is essential for chan- 
nel flipping Once again this study 
is not scientific, and we have no lia- 
bility for your anarchist reaction to 
"Flipper" reruns. Without further 
ado. here they are: 
•"Welcome Back, Kotter" (Nick at 
Nile) This classic from my child- 
hood brings four of the most inter- 
esting characters lo (elevision: 
Vinnie Barbarino (pre- "Pulp 
Fiction" John Travolta). Arnold 
Horshack. Freddie "Boom Boom" 
Washington and my personal 
favorite, the Jewish Pueno Rican. 
Juan Epstein. The show created 
many lines which became part of 
the 70s T-shin culture 
•"The Prisoner" (Sci-Fi&gt; Patrick 
McGooban stars in one of the 
strangest serials in television histo- 



ry McGoohan's spirit is constantly 
under attack from the turnkeys of 
"the village " The show runs on 
Thursday night at 3 a.m. or is that 
Friday morning? The most interest- 
ing aspect of "The Prisoner" on the 
Sci-Fi network is how it is wired 
into the Internet Viewer comments 
appear at the bottom of the screen. 
The comments are almost as strange 
as the show. 

•"Law &amp; Order" (A&amp;E) The entire 
run of the series plays twice a day 
on A&amp;E: once at 10 p.m. and the 
same episode is rerun at 2 a.m. The 
courtroom action is a bell of a lol 
more interesting than the OJ trial 
(more realistic, even though 
Johnnie Cochrane is a tremendous 
actor). 

•"The Adventures of Hercules" 
(WGN. WFFT) Kevin Sorbo por- 
trays the son of Zeus with a certain 
sense humor and grace Sorbo's 



Hercules is a departure from the 
muscle-headed hams, who have 
worn the loin cloth in the past. 
•"Biography" (A&amp;E) How can any- 
one watch late nite TV without flip- 
ping to A&amp;E or the Discovery chan- 
nel for a documentary Lately, 
"Biography" has had theme weeks, 
in which the show features a certain 
type of historical figure. Sex sym- 
bols (Brando. Dean. Monroe), 
women who broke (he 
mold! Madonna, Streisand) and 
wartime generals (Ike, McArthur, 
Bradley. Pershing) have been some 
recent themes. 

•"Quantum Leap" (USA. Sci-Fi) 
Scott Bakula and Dean Siockwell 
travel through time in this some- 
times historical, sometimes humor- 
ous, but always entertaining voy- 
ages of Dr. Beckett. The finale was 



somewhat of a letdown, but 
Hollywood endings are not always 
needed. 

•"Kung Fu" (TNT) Quest with 
Caine to find his brother in the Old 
West. Caine (David Caradine) 
fought racism, ignorance and vio- 
lence throughout the run of the 
scries. The series also featured 
unusual camera angles not normally 
seen on the little screen. 
•"Wings" (USA) The show features 
one of the best casts since "Cheers." 
Antonio and Lowell are two of the 
better characters created (or prime 
time. Only Niles on Frazier can 
compare lo them. Not surprisingly, 
Cheers, Wings and Frazier were 
created by the same producers. 
•'Taxi" (Nick at Nile) 'Taxi" is the 
only decern series Tony Danza ever 
"acied" in (even though I loved 




"Going 
Bananas.") Danza really 
demonstrated his depth of acting as 
a punch drunk palooka What a 
stretch. He may have taken method 
acting to new levels. 

Occasionally none of these arc 
on and the viewer bas to settle for 
MTV and the endless commercials 
(or albums Hopefully a rerun of 
"The Maxx" will be aired immedi- 
ately after "Aeon Flux,"

your weight around? 




BEFORE TRUSTING YOUR FUTURE 

TO ANY COMEfVNY, ASK FOR 
SOME LETTERS OF REFERENCE. 



You put more than just your savings into 
a retirement company. You put in 
your trust and hopes for the future, too So 
before you choose one, ask some questions. 
How stable is the company? How solid are 
its investments? How sound is its overall 
financial health? 

A good place to start looking for answers 
is in the ratings of independent analysts. 
Four companies, all widely recognized 
resources for finding out how strong a 
financial services company really is, gave 
TIAA their top grade. 



TIAA received A+ + (Superior) from A.M. 
Best Co.. AAA from Duff &amp; Phelps Credit 
Rating Co,, Aaa from Moody's Investors 
Service and AAA from Standard &amp; Poor's 
These ratings reflect TIAA's stability, sound 
investments, claims- paying ability and over- 
all financial strength. (These are ratings of 



mpanies only, so they do not 
apply to CREF) 

And TIAA-which, backed by the company's 
claims-paving ability, offers a guaranteed rate 
of return and the opportunity lor dividends-is 
one of a handful of insurance companies nation- 
wide that currently hold these highest marks. 



For further growth potential and diversi- 
fication, there's the CREF variable annuity, 
with seven different investment accounts to 
give you the flexibility you want as you save 
for the future* 

Together. TIAA and CREF form the world's 
largest private retirement system based 
on assets under management, with over 
$145 billion in assets and more than 75 
years of experience serving the education 
community. For over a million and a half 
people nationwide, the only letters to 
remember are TIAA-CREF. 



Ensuring the future

Against St Joseph's, (he 'Dons 
faired less favorably. The only win 
in match play came from the dou- 
bles team of Bermes and Monica 
Espinosa. The duo defeated the 
Pumas 8-7.

Lakes Valley Conference in both

For Judy Tillapaugh running is a 
way of life. It is a way to relieve 
stress, to socialize, to enjoy nature 
and to stay physically fit. As the 
Mastodons cross country coach, 
Tillapaugh would like to convey 
tbat love of running to all of her 
athletes. 

"1 just love running." said 
Tillapaugh, "I started in junior high 
competing in the quarter mile and 
progressed from there.'' 

During her college days 
Tillapaugh competed at the NCAA 
Division I-A level. As a 1982 grad- 
uate of Purdue University. 
Tillapaugh was a member of very 
successful teams for the 
Boilermakers. 

"I competed for four years in 
cross country and three in track and 
field. Probably my best year was 
1979 when I competed in the cross 
country and outdoor track nationals. 
1 can honestly say that I ran against 
Joan Benoit-Samuel," said 
Tillapaugh. (Benoit-Samuel is one 
of the world's most successful dis- 
tance runners.] 

Tillapaugh, who is in her first 
year as the Mastodons coach, has 
only been a member of the campus 
community since early August 

"That is one of the reasons for 
(he lack of runners on the team. 
There was not any recruiting done 
prior to my getting, here, I tfnruc 3 lbis 
season is a building season to mak- 



ing improvements for 1996 and 
beyond." said Tillapaugh. 

After fielding a small squad lo 
begin the season, Tillapaugh indi- 
cated that she finally has enough 
athletes to have 
both a full men's — 
team and a full 
women's team. 
There are a cou- 
ple of athletes 
who are compet- 
ing in cross 
country for the 
first lime. 

"We have six 
runners on each 
team, but that 
does not mean 
there is not room 
for more. I would 
like to get to the 
point where we 
have seven and 
seven. It would 
be really nice to 
have 14 women 
and 14 men on 
next year's 

leam," added 

Tillapaugh. 

Although she has dealt with 
adversity to begin the season, 
Tillapaugh is quite pleased with the 
performances of both cross country 
teams Senior Jason Douglas has 
been one of the most consistent run- 
ners as he has finished in the top 15 
in the last three lnvitationals.

however, a 




number of 




college 


Jim Porter

stars have 




failed (o 


tinder the Bleachers 


leave the 
violence on 




the field 



and have taken it into the private 
lives of others: in this case, into the 
lives of women. 

In the opening month of the col- 
lege football season we have seen 
blowouts like never before. At the 
same time, we have been forced to 
bear witness-to a disturbing display 
of physical violence off the playing 
field 

For example. University of 
Miami linebacker Ray Lewis is 
currently being investigated for his 
alleged involvement in a shoving. 
match with his present girlfriend 
and an en-girlfriend The school 
has shown no intention of disci- 
plining Lewis: he still plays on the 
Hurricane's team. 

Nilo Silvan, a wide receiver at 
Tennessee was arrested for alleged- 
ly raping a roommate's girlfriend. 
It was the second time in a week 
that a Volunteer football player 
was arrested for sexually related 
crimes. To their credit, the admin- 
istration at Tennessee saw to it that 
Silvan was dismissed from the 
team He will be allowed to return 
to the team only if found innocent 
by the coun. 

Then, there is the much publi- 
cized case of Nebraska running 
back Lawrence Phillips. Phillips 
pleaded no contest lo charges that 
he hit his former girlfriend at her 
apartment Phillips had been placed 
on indefinite suspension by the 
coaching staff at Nebraska, but 
Head coach Tom Osborne has indi- 
cated he may allow Phillips to 
return to the team in less than a 
month. 

In the case of Phillips. Osborne 
has announced that if doctors can 
confirm that he has learned to con- 
trol his anger, he can return to the 
team Hie Comhuskers head coach 
says that every four or five months 
Phillips has an outburst like this, 
hut the coach does not believe 
Phillips is a violent threat to soci- 
ety. Osborne says that he needs 
football to keep his life under con- 
trol. 



The question has to be asked 
then, what will the criteria be for 
deciding how and when Phillips 
has his anger under control? The 
argument that he needs football as 
a foundation for keeping his life 
straight holds no water Prior to the 
incident. Phillips was one of the 
most highly touted football players 
in the country In fact, many so- 
called experts were ready lo give 
the Nebraska running back the 
Heisman trophy at the start of the 
season. 

What is this world coming to? 
How has it happened that we, as a 
society, have told athletes, even if 
indirectly, that rules and laws do 
not apply to them because of their 
abilities? From the fans to the 
media, we are all to blame (or this 
travesty. It is a privilege to play 
collegiate athletics. Only a few are 
given the opportunity to display 
their talents at the highest levels of 
competition. Yet. because they are 
gifted, we have in effect told them 
that whatever they do outside ibe 
arena of competition is acceptable. 

The lime has come to stop hand- 
ing out second, in some cases third 
or fourth, chances like government 
cheese. There are already too many 
Darryl Strawberry. Steve Howe 
and "Doc" Gooden cases in the 
world of sports. Start making these 
athletes lake responsibility for their 
actions. Take the ball away and do 
not allow them to play the game 
any longer. 

It is sad that administrators and 
alumnae do not stand up and say 
"enough already!" So maybe a 
school loses some talent. Maybe a 
program suffers for a white as it 
recuperates from the dismissal of a 
star player I say thai is a much bet- 
ter alternative than the current 
trend. What happens to these ath- 
letes when the games are over? 
What happens when their lives can 
no longer revolve around the field 
of play and their accomplishments 1 
Quit allowing an athlete special 
treatment because be has been 
bestowed with a gifted talent. If 
nothing else, high profile athletes 
should be held to a higher standard 
because of their status. 

Take it as you will. Just remem- 
ber... the view from under the 
bleachers is not always a pretty 
sight.

Volleydon's trip north could prove vital 



By "Spike" Debanl 
Sports Writer 

After dropping two consecutive 
home games, the Volleydons hit the 
road and faced conference oppo- 
nents Southern Indiana and 
Kentucky Wesleyan. The road 
proved 10 be much more hospitable 
as the 'Dons improved to 1 1-2 over- 
all. The road to victory and ultimate- 
ly the Volleydons goal of making 
ihe NCAA tournament gets much 
tougher this weekend 

After warming up against S1U 
and Kentucky Wesleyan, the 'Dons 
head to Michigan to take on perenni- 
al Great Lakes Intercollegiate 
Athletic Conference (GLIAC) pow- 
erhouses Norihern Michigan and 
Michigan Tech. The Volleydons 
will face the NMU Wildcats on 
Friday and the Huskies of Michigan 
Tech on Saturday, Boih teams are 
highly ranked in the region and 
could possibly be contenders for ihe 
NCAA title come early December. 
The Wildcats are the NCAA 
Division II National Champions two 
years running. 



"This week (end) could have die 
most impact on the regional rank- 
ings of any week on our schedule," 
said Head Coach Tim Heffron 

Northern Michigan is 11-2 over- 
all and 2-0 in GLIAC play going 
into the weekend, The defending 
national champions lost only one 
senior prior lo this season and look 
to be a formidable force. 

"They (Norihern Michigan) are 
basically the same team that we 
faced last season. A year ago was a 
learning experience for us. This year 
it will be more of a test to see just 
where we are and how much we 
have learned in a year," said 
Heffron. 

Michigan Tech, on the other 
hand, lost five seniors to graduation 
and has struggled thus far. The 
Huskies stand at 5-5 overall 
although they too have an unblem- 
ished GLIAC record at 2-0. 

"Michigan Tech will be a differ- 
ent team than we faced last year. It 
will be hard to pin-point just where 
we are after playing them," added 
Heffron. 

The road to success is often long 



and bumpy. This weekend could be 
the weekend that the Volleydons 
step up to show the volleyball world 
what kind of team they have 
become. With important inter con- 
ference games against lop teams 
from the GLIAC. Heffron's team 
plans to make the best showing it is 
capable of making 

Senior Heather Teagarden and 
junior Julie Parrot will be expected 
to raise their level of play in order lo 
lead the leam. A good showing from 
both players is crucial to leam suc- 
cess according to Heffron. 

"Julie has really come on offen- 
sively the past couple of weeks, 
Heather is gelling over the flu, but I 
expect her to be back in lop condi- 
tion this weekend. Both of ihcm will 
have to play well in order to raise 
ihe team's play." he said. 

The matches Ihis weekend are 
critical to the regional rankings. 



Only the lop four learns in the 
region, basically the GLVC and 
GLIAC, are invited to play in the 
NCAA regional tournament. Wins 
against either the Wildcats or the 
Huskies could be very significant 
victories for the 'Dons. 

"If we can win Iwo out of three 
this week, (the Dons also play 
GLIAC opponent Grand Valley 
State) we should be sitting in pretty 
good shape in the region," explained 
Heffron. 

With all of the intensity and 
imporiancc surrounding this week- 
end, one might expect "''iii^dijfc 
a little apprehensive about traveling 
to Michigan, However, it is quite the 
contrary 

"These games will be a real 
barometer check for us. I am look- 
ing forward to ihe matches as a test 
of the team," said Heffron.
