professionals such as doc ton or lawyers. 

IPFW Is young, but i( is the sixth largest institution of 
higher learning in Indiana and can boast of having over 
14,000 gradual.-. The turn- h..s erne lor IPFW to say to the 
public. "Hey, look at us!" In many ways, It does, but there 
are other ways It can. 

First, lei's give credit where It Is due. 

If it weren't for press releases from University Relations, 
Fort Wayne's media (wouldn't know IPFW exists. They 
wouldn't know IPFW had established a cancer detection 
research center or that It is trying to help bring high 
technology firms into the area . 

If It weren't (or the admissions office scheduling dales for 
IPFW representatives to visit ares high schools, many high 
school seniors wouldn't know there are approximately ion 
degree programs here. 

Because ol these offices, many know IPFW has come a 
long way. 

Bui more could learn annul this campus if D?FW ad- 

commercials that said. "I^arn a living at IVY Tech," or "Al 
Mancheslcr, you won't be treated like just another number " 
IPFW could jdvcriisf :\ "Idr. ,i well-rounded education in a 
real-world atmosphere II could advertise this area has 
benefitted from IPFW graduales. 

John Hobson, director ol alumni activities, said. "Over 
seven thousand alumni have stayed in Allen County and used 
their talents to benefil the community. I think It is wonderful 
lor Ihe community lo reap the benefits." 

IPFW's act-oss table television channel 23 Is doing its shore 
of promoting IPFW. and mlehl be able lo do mure Besides 
broadcasting information shout financial aid, courses, 
seminars and events al IPFW. it will hopefully video tape 
and broadcast IPFW "s basketball games neit year if a cable 
is connected Irom the Multipurpose Building lothe television 
station in Ihe Helmke Library. This would give both the 
university and Ihe athletic department a boosl IPFW should 
also try lo work out a legal arrangement lo tape and 
broadcast PIT productions on channel 23. ( 

IPFW has proved itself, and people should know aboul it 
Baseball great Diziy Deononcesaid. "ft you cando what you
