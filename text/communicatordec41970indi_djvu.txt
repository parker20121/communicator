by Sieve Franks 

The lU-Purdue Convoca- 
tion Series brought D ihe campus 
last Wednesday Dr. Charles 
Hurst, Pfesidenl o[ Malcolm X 
College of Chicago. 

TTie program started with an 
introduction bv Miss Joanne 
Shade of lU-Purduc. After that 
Dr. Hurst sinned by citmg that 
il is only two days until the 
anniversary of the deaths of 
Black I\inthcrs Hampton and 
Clark (a student at ^blcolm X^ 
"Maybe it all would have been 
worth while, if there would have 
been some changes in ihe coin- 
lr&gt;-." But there were no changes, 
and this situation is due niainly 
to a lack of insight by many 
people into current problems. 

He talked of the myth of 
integmtion, which lo the Negro 
is a "ficlicious carrot thrust 
before him on a slick". It can- 
not ever be achieved, for in- 
tef^^tion means a coal of while 
ptiint on the Negro and a dis- 
appearance of identity and cul- 
ture. Ill is is what today's 
Negroes will not stand for, for 
it means a death lo the Nef^o 
race. Today's mililanls have ig- 
nored the idea of intep^tion, 
is-hile the NAACP and Urban 
League go on^sccomplishing 
nothing even with Civil Rights 
Legislation. 

Ifick consciencness can 
only be acknowledged and main- 
tained by Blacks. White goals 
and life styles maim this. 
"When people are isolated, they 
must keep their own folkways, 
culture, and mores." Who is to 
say whether or not this stepping- 
to-your-own -drummer will not 
[Toduce supremacy rvlher than 
equality. 

TTic Black Consciencenesa 
mo\-emenls have slowly begun. 
TTiey work in psychological 
means to promoted Black iden- 
tity dignity and purpose- He 



natural haircut i 
mcaos to hold together Black 
Unity. Black is Beautiful move- 
ments are another. Cultural 
movements arc yet unolhcr. The 
shame incurred upon Blacks by 
ihe whilcsociety has led to not 
invisibility and conformity, as 
in the post; rather it has led lo 
defiance aid open rebellion. 

Howcan a Black child ^rtrw 
to be a Black Man? If he is a 
"good boy", he conforms to a 
ivbite image. If he questions, he 
isjobclleda "bad boy" . How 
can changes he made? Dr. Ifirsl 
feels that changes in ethnical 
slniclure must come with youths 
(especially Balck youth) dis- 
satisfaction of militancy. Tliis 
nation has a heritage of mili- 
tancy. This nation spends mil- 
lions to go to the mooil-see no- 
ihing-ond call it beautiful. Per- 
haps, Di:. Hurst says, nuclear 
weapons are the key lo making 
earth beautiful. Tliink about 
that. 

Black Studies programs 
have potential, wt the ones to- 
day that are faulty and damaging, 
hpt the ones written by while 
writers who are slanted . Nol the 
das ted-off social science 
courses which simply relate 
facts. But the ones which couple 
leomiag with a rehumaaizing oT 
people! Tliat's what Nblcolm X 
Uiiversity is allabout. It ca- 
ters lo the young kind of person 
who sees freedom as ihe moot 
pceeiouB commodity, and sees 
a dehumanized life without. faee- 
dom not worth living. With this, 
peace con come- 
Once, while Dr. Hnral waf 
speaking ot another lecture, 
someone told him that if he 
didn't like America he could 
leave. His feeling an that he 
won't leave. He also won't hum

Let's help the handicapped 



too 

How can one voice be raised as lo be heard above ihe atif- 
linf; quiet of opothy? Wiere ofc ihe loud libefala, the righteous 
conservatives, and ouf national jelly o[ moderales? In terms of 
tnnffible accomplishnKots tov&gt;'ard rehabilitation of the handicap- 
ped, they are invisible. 

For everyone has forgollen the handicapped. 

Lei us rehabilitate the handicapped by making; certain that 
■here are no mmps From parkin); lot to buklding, by building doors 
wliich ore not wide enoufi^ for wheel chaira lo pass, by placing 
unnecessary doors into classroom corridors which cannot be 
opened From a wheel chair, by providing im exits For handicapped 
persons which can be utilized only ihrouRh use oF elevators, by 
ignoring the enormous Financial burden oF the handicapped,* by 
p-oviding rest room facilities ivhich are too narrow for wheel 
chaira, or by placing vending machines in ihe cafeteria which 
cannot be used by handicapped students because the coin slots 

TTie handicapped rarely cry for sympathy. Rarely, even, does 
a handicapped person voice the realities of his situation lest it 
bo interpreted as a call for sympathy. 'Hiis ivritcr, knowing full 
will that he cannot fully comprehend the pli^t of being handi- 
capped, has extracted ihrou^ on interview with a handicapped 
individual a partial glimpse of what it means lo be handicapped. 

It means building an ego through enduring needless hardship. 

But wliol can one voice accomplish when speakinR oE the 
problems of the ofdicled to the comFortabIc? The handicapped 
individual soon learns that his plif^t is Ihe concern solely of 
himself. And, so, he quietly and determinedly makes as much as 
be can from a rolten situation. A detestable situation caused by 
all of us - - the invisible "ccmcemed" genemtion.

Donors Get the Ball Rolling 



Most people think of college 
professors and univcraity admin- 
istratore as "ivy tower" lypcs 
with little interest in aiiairs be- 
yoDil the classroom. But, 
though this might once have 
been so, the educator of today 
is a far different breed of cat. 
Take, for example, the faculty 
at Indiana-Purdue Fort Wayne, 
which proudly boasts that it is&lt; 
athletically-oriented. 

Recently, colleges and uni- 
versities have suffered a wove 
of stu)]ent protest. A major cause 
of ihiB dissatisfaction with the 
school prop^m and personnel— 
teachers who like neither their 
jobs nor their atudents-a lack 
of rapport between students, 
(acuity, administiation, and 
alumni. Involvement between 
these four groups has resulted 
in fl mutual interest propqm — 
Softball. 

Indiana-Rirdue faculty and 
admlDistrolora included: I&gt;. 
Bruce Davis, I&gt;. Milte Downs, 
Dr. Dick Huston, Dr. Bill Moebs, 
Dr. Dave Skelton; ftofessora 



Dean Yoqulet. Phil Kennell 
Dave Smith, and Jim Bolinger. 
Id addition, private and state- 
supported institutions coopera- 
ted in that Professor Pliil Martin 
of International College was one 
of the mainstays of the team. 
Additional students, alumni, and 
prospective students from Indi- 
ana—Purdue and International 
included: Jim Livengood, Dave 
Hykfonlz, Phil Keppel, Steve 
Baker, Jim Miller, and Dave 
JuncQu. Tom Corrcns and ftl 
McMahon from the local^com- 
munity also participated. 

How do you finance such 
an operation? it cost approni- 
nwlcly Sl.OOO to equip and 
maintain a softball team. An 
anonymous donor started the 
ball rolling by paying the entry 
fee. Other sponsors included:, 
L and S Equipment Company, 
Dick Miller Firestone Service, 
Keefer Printing Company, Dave

I made my way dowTi the

back-stage to be pceted by the 
hammering, talking and laughing 
plus other unidentified cheerful 
noises. "Where can I find 
Linda Lubkin?" I said, raising 
my voice, "Right ibtoa^ that 
opening," was the directing 
reply. 

LJnda was slowly dancing 
around a costume she was 
making, cutting, wrapping, and 
talking as she worked. She is 
presbntly working with the

"Yes." At that time sbe^just

family oftsp-ing all the way from babies to young adults. Gifts can 
range from baby rattles, squeeze toys and blocks to dolls, model 
planes, records, ties and cosmetics. All will be appreciated by the 
giver and receiver alike,"

continued and so did the cold 
weather. TTie temperature was 
in the high to mid 30*3. but 
with the wind blowing from 
2030 m.p.h. it felt sub-zero. 
llie players and fans cureed 
the weather as toes, fingers, 
ears, and faces ached with cold. 
Cars lined the sidcliofd and 
playere and spectators jumped 
into them at every opportunity 
to escape the numbing wind. 

In the first game November 
22i "' 1=30. Hallcy proved to be 
the smartest team,) because 
ihcy didn't show up and lost by 
forfeit to Wcrling. 

Also at 1:30, Johanns beat 
Aschbachcr. Johanna scored a 
touchdown and went into a g-Q 
lend. Later they scored a 
safety, till' '&gt;""'&gt; about ivas fair

Bui Aschbachcr could do no 
more and the game ended

gel colder and the mnd blew 
harder as the second two games 
storied. The weather had a 
great deal of affect on the 
playing, ftssing into the 
20-30 mile wind was very 
difficult and running against it 
was like trudging throu^ ankle 
deep mud. On the other hand 
80 yard passes with the wind 
seemed easy. Also the players, 
with their numb hands, had 
trouble grasping the football or 
pulling the flags. 

Johanns and Aschbacher

Evan, keyboards. 

Seeing jethro T\ill live is 
very much like discovering 
several marijuana plants in your 
own bock yard. It's a rare 
treat, TTiey have a way of ca|&gt;- 
tivating the audience. On stage 
Anderson is o magical, half- 
crazed Neanderthal Man looking 
. Their songs 



range from love ballads to 
hardest of the hard rock tunes. 
■J;thro Tull are really two 
bands. Uey are one thing live 
and another thing, on recoid. 
Their albums don't bring out 
the hardness of the stage pre- 
sence. TTiey can be smooth, 
hand, soft, and always tasteful 
in the same breath, [iuep your 
eyes open for their next album, 
and give them a chance if you 
haven't yet.
