School of Education meets criteria for accreditation 




The School of Education 
recently received 

accreditation. 



In November, IPFWs 
School of Education was 
accredited under (he perfor- 
mance-oriented standards of the 
National Council for 
Accreditation of Teacher 
Education (NCATE). 

Over 500 institutions are 
accredited by the NCATE and 
IPFWs School of Education 
was one of the first 57 schools 
10 receive either initial or con- 



tinuation accreditation in the most 
recent round of decisions made by 
the NCATE's Unit Accreditation 
Board. 

"With the reaccreditalion from 
NCATE," Chancellor Michael 
Wart ell said, "wc can assure our 
graduates that they are receiving 
skills, knowledge, and training 
needed to meet the demands of 
loday's classroom." 

Standards set by the profession 
and members of the public were the 
guidelines used by the NCATE in 
deciding on which institutions 
received accreditation. 



According 10 Wartell, such an 
accreditation is necessary in order to 
assure that graduates will be taken 
seriously when approaching the job 
market. 

"Employers can be assured that 
when they hire a graduate from 
IPFW's School of Education, they 
arc hiring someone who will have 
ihe needed expertise to succeed in 
the classroom environment," 
Wartell said. 

Subject matter content and 
leaching methods are both priorities 
in order lo gel accreditation from 
the NCATE, but institutions must 



also be instructing students to use 
technology in instruction and insti- 
tutions must be preparing students 
to leach people from diverse 
backgrounds. 

Besides meeting all of these cri- 
teria, the institutions must keep pro- 
grams in a framework that is based 
on current and established research 
and best practice. 

Interim Dean of the School of 
Education David McCants is proud 
of the accreditation. 

I commend the faculty and 
staff of the School of Education and 
those who have served in adminis- 




Years of 
service 
pay off 

by Mishanna Wood 
News Editor 

Allen Pugh 
became the new 
dean of the 
School of 
Engineering, 
Technology and 
Computer 
Science on Nov. 
I. 

Pugh has 
been a faculty 
member of 
IPFW since 1981 
as well as an 
integral member 

of the adminis- 

(ration, serving 

as chair of manufacturing technology, 

director of organizational leadership 

and supervision, director of industrial 

engineering technology and chair of 

engineering. 

He is also a long-standing mem- 
ber of the International Board of 
Editors for the Journal of Computers 
and Industrial Engineering. 

Pugh received the Magoon award 
for teaching in 1981 and 1997 at 
Purdue. 

He holds a doctorate and master 
of science in industrial engineering 
from Purdue University. His expertise 
is focused in statistical process con- 
trol, simulation and selective assem- 
bly. 

Pugh served as interim dean 
before obtaining his new position. 

The national search for a dean of 
the School of Engineering, 
Technology and Computer Science 
was conducted during the 1995-1996 
academic years. There were two can- 
didates, but neither of them filled the 
position. 

In May of 1997, Pugh became the 
interim dean. 

Almost a year later an internal 
search was conducted and faculty, 
chairs, staff, and members of ihe 
community advisory council were 
solicited about their opinion on Pugh 
becoming a permanent dean. 

According to Susan Hannah, 
interim vice chancellor of student 
affairs, the support for him to be dean 
was solid. 

Pugh has replaced outdated mate- 
rial, keeping the technology up to 
speed. Programs such as CIMT, 
(Computet Integrated Manufacturing 
Technology) and MDDT (Mechanical 
Drafting and Testing Technology) 
have been altered or eliminated to 
help with student needs. 

Some of the information from 
these programs was incorporated into 
the Mechanical Engineering 
Technology (MET) program. 

"Every program within ETS is 
very lechnology-orienied and tech- 
nology changes very fast. The major 
goal is to update labs. In some areas a 
two-year old lab is very outdated," 
Pugh said. 

Pugh has reconstituted some of 
the Fort Wayne committees to 
become active with the IPFW, ETS 
program once again. 

"The most rewarding part of this 
position is when you see success," 
Pugh said. 



It's that time of year again 




Students work furiously to get that last assignment done before deadline.

by Mishanna Wood 
News Editor 

The Fort Wayne Engineers Club 
is offering approximately twenty

our committee who are former 
recipients," Kalb said. 



native positions in recent years for 
their dedication to meeting the 
extensive and exacting standards of 
the NCATE," McCants said. 

"The NCATE imprimatur is an 
important evidence that the IPFW 
School of Education is serving the 
citizenry and school corporations of 
northeastern Indiana well," he 
added. 

NCATE is recognized by the 
U.S. Department of Education as 
the professional accrediting body 
for schools, departments, and col- 
leges of education. 



Santa at IPFW 



by Carrie Leathers 



Chief Reporter 

Tomorrow morning children 
will be able to visit with Santa and 
lake part in holiday activities arid 
songs. "Breakfast with the Claus" 
has been an annual event at IPFW 
since the 1980s. 

"It is really an IPFW campus 
community event," Director of 
Student Activities Kim Jacobs said. 
"We continue doing it each year 
because family events generally go 
over well because our student body 
is older." 

Children are provided with 
breakfast and given coloring activi- 
ties at their tables. 

Afler eating, there will be other 



activities and an entertainer who 
will perform interactive songs and 
skits with the children. 

"There will be a cookie plate to 
color and leave cookies for Santa 
on," Jacobs said. "We also usually 
put up a big Christmas present list 
for kids to write to Santa on." 

All this is prior lo Santa's 
arrival at which lime each child will 
gel a chance to talk to Santa and 
have their photograph taken with 
him. 

The children will also receive a 
small gift. 

"It's always well-received," 
Jacobs said. "It always is a lot of 
Tun for Ihe kids." 

Tickets may still be available 
through Student Activities at 481- 
6609.

A search for an admissions 
director was conducted last year but 
there were no applicants. Due to 
Isaacs' past accomplishments at 
IPFW, she earned an internal 
promotion. 

According to Frank Borelli, 
vice chancellor of student affairs, 
there was a consensus among staff 
members who favored Isaacs' 
promotion. 

As interim director, she created 
a new strategy for increasing enroll- 
ments and processing applications. 
Isaacs reduced the size of the appli- 



cation for 
admission 
from three 
pages to one, 
making it more

New self-esteem techniques in 
education 



by Dcddy Hidayai Jong -Editorial Cartoonis. 



Dear Editor, 

This is in response to a 20/20 pro- 
gram presented by ABC on Wednesday. 
December 2 on the new technique (self- 
esteem) thai is being implemented in 
U.S. public schools today. Now. 
schools are trying to boost students' 
self-esteem by giving higher grades 
(with doses of praises) regardless of 
performance. 

Allow me to state my perceptions of 
trie assumed problems: 

Problems with Making School 
Highly Competitive; There are only a 
few winning "positions" by default. 
Thus, many are left with damaged self- 
esteem, doomed to fail. But, 1 think the 
few winners suffer the most (what?). It 
is frustrating in always searching to 
find significance in your achievement 
(not to mention the blotted ego and 
teamwork problems). 

Problems with the New Theme: 
Lack of motivation, responsibility, and 
act nun lability. 

The result: happy students, rising 
high school grades, and falling perfor- 
mances (SAT, mathematics and science 



Staff Editorial 



world competition). To that end. I 
couldn't help but state: 

Have: Secure a stable self-esteem 
that will not be affected by any circum- 
stance or performance. 

Foster. Affirm the character traits 
(kindness, integrity, patience, creativity. 
confidence, etc.) of your children (or 
future children) instead of getting 
caught up in their performance. 

Principle: Lose yourself, have a 
life, and make a difference. Don't try to 
get significance from your achieve- 
ments, rather bring significance to your 
hard work. 

Standard. Compete with yourself so 
you won't be limited by anybody. 

Check: Be pan of highly competi- 
tive school to test the reality of your 
self-esteem and personal growth. 

I know. I know, I am not remotely 
close to a solution. I choose to leave the 
how to my readers with the above 
incompleie list of alternatives.

It is that time of the year again and the 
ever-popular subject of textbooks is on all 
of our minds. 

As we get closer to next semester, 
every one of us will be involved in the pur- 
chase of textbooks for our classes. 

Unless you are rortunate enough io 
either have a professor who only has 
assigned reading from the library or choose 
not io buy a texibook for the class, either 
way most of us will purchase textbooks. 

This is a hectic time of year for all stu- 
dents and is also costly. The way that our 
campus is set up we only have one choice 
on where io conveniently buy our 
textbooks. 

With the knowledge I have gained from 
Dr. Bullion's "Fundamentals of 
Economics" class, I realize that competi- 
tion plays an important role in the prices of 
products for consumers. 

To help with this problem and to help in 
reducing student costs, I am noiifying ihe 
student body of purchasing books via the 
Internet. 

Students can save big bucks if ihey 
would visit the web site called 
"varsitybooks com ." 

This is an easy-io-use web site and can 
save the students up to 40% on new hooks. 
The site is user-friendly and books can 
be attained within 2 business days. 

I urge everyone to visit the site to get 
J more of the specifics, and can arouse inter- 
est by giving you my own experiences on 
the web site. 

Varsity Books was started by two col- 
lege students on the East Coast and has 
grown rapidly in the past two years. 

Varsity Books has received national 
attention in "Newsweek," "Entrepreneur," 
and recently in "USA Today." 



Although the site is new, it is profes- 
sionally done and is very user-friendly. 

Personal experiences with this web site 
have produced some good results and some 
bad. 

1 personally looked up a public rela- 
tions book that is used on this campus and 
received amazing results. 

The new textbook cost S45 plus tax at 
our bookstore. I could have bought die 
book for a total of $34.95 through Varsitv 
Books 

There is no sales lax .tnd shipping onlv 
costs S4.95. 

The bad aspect was that I could not find 
a German or communicaiions book through 
the web site. 

The books were out of stock. The web 
site suggested checking back, though, 
because books are restocked daily. 

It only takes two days to receive your 
books and the prices are worth it so you can 
check every day unu'l classes begin if you 
choose to go that route 

The only information you need to find 
your book is one of three things. 

You will need either the title, author, or 
the ISBN number of the book. 

The ISBN number is usually the best 
way because then you don't have to worry 
about which edition you need. 

This is for your information only and is 
only another avenue to help alleviate stu- 
dent costs. 

I hope this semes- 
ter went well and future 
semesters are even bet-

Joseph B. Schrocder.

*m rm it ?g\ it \#w

Columnist 



How was 1998 for you? 



I was going lo lake this time 
lo wrap up Ihe year of 1998. 

I could go on and on about 
some of the lame stories of the 
year or reverse the trend and 
become mainstream. 

I could write about the 
Titanic movie and how wonder- 
ful ibe film was. Or bow 
Hollywood keeps churning out 
fantastic movies, especially all 
of the remakes. 

Ranting and raving about 
popular culture just isn't my 
style. 1 don't think I even have a 
style. But I've noticed that all of 
the year-end "lists" are starting 
to sprout up throughout the 
country, especially in the media. 

Was 1998 a good year for 
you? Here's my perspective for 
what it's worth. 

The Sosa-McGwire home 
run chase has to be at the top of 
my list. Here we had two guys 
who hit a combined 136 home 
runs in one season! 

Both oT them broke the 
Roger Maris mark of 62, and the 
Cubs even made the post-season 
for only the third time since 
1945. Even people who don't 
follow baseball jumped on 
board for this dramatic down- 
to-lhe-wire race. 

Congratulations to both 
Mark and Sammy for giving 
baseball back to the public, and 
again, making it our national 



pastime. 

Another sports related story 
would be the NBA lockout. First 
of all, I don'i watch pro hoops, 
so it doesn't affect me at all. I 
still have to see Michael's face 
all over the television, so it's 
not as if I'm noi reminded of the 
NBA and its posier-boy, Jordan. 
I wish he would just retire, but 
then again. I guess I don't care. 

Remember when profession- 
al sports were about winning 
and staying with teams for your 
whole career? Those days are 
long gone. Where have you 
gone, Joe DiMaggio ? 

I noticed "Swing" was popu- 
lar for about fifteen minutes. No 
offense, but dance crazes are 
created for those who are too 
timid lo create their own indi- 
viduality. Being a follower is 
probably good for some of you 
because you were emotionally 
designed to be led around by 
mainstream fads and trends. 

Hopefully, as you grow 
older, you will be able lo laugh 
at your past, and your attraction 
to these fly-hy-night fads, as we 
are laughing at you today. Hey, 
maybe "The Hustle" and the 
"The Bump" will come back to 
match the clothes you are 
buying. 

Hang in there, new fads 
from California and New York 
should be here by the spring. 



The whole While House 
"scandal," well. I said I would- 
n't talk about it anymore. I 
guess I licd-but so did Bill, 
Monica and Linda. Oh. that 
sneaky Linda Tripp; talk about 
having an agenda. 

And Ken Starr sure loves 
himself doesn't he? Have you 
heard this guy talk? Thank God 
it isn't a top story anymore; it's 
hard enough watching the news 
as it is anyway. 

Some people are still talking 
about it. In fact, I know a guy at 
work who talks about it 
everyday. 

He's totally obsessed with 
the whole thing. Again, it is a 
serious subject, but national 
security was never at risk as far 
as I'm concerned, Republicans 
sure are a Tunny group, and Iheir 
presidents have ALL been saints 
too. 

1 can't think of any good 
music that came out. It was 
pretty much the same old stuff 
as last year except that in 1998. 
EVERYBODY had a song on a 
soundtrack from some movie. 

I know why groups do this; 
money, ihe bottom line in the 
music industry, There arc a few 
bands that still play because 
they love the music and their 
fans. 1 just can't think of any 
right now. 

And what's the deal with

Meatloaf. Billy Joel and Elton 
John? Who is buying ihis crap? 
And what is up with ihe Rap 
scene? Are shootings at concerts 
part of the deal? Just another 
reason to hate violence in 
music. 

The past year showed us an 
increase in reported AIDS eases 
(globally), and violent crimes 
fell quite a bit. Do you still 
think that birth control is 
optional? I see the dynamics of 
daiing here on campus. 

Your partner may look like 
he or she couldn't possibly get 
the virus. Go ahead and gamble. 
And for all you little boys who 
say you can't "feel" anything 
when you wear a condom, "feel" 
sick for about eighteen months, 
vomit, become constantly nau- 
seous, watch yourself lose 
weight and then hopefully after 
all of that, you will be lucky 
enough to die. 

You gals too. if you think 
it's okay to have unsafe sex, you 
are telling your partner that you 
just don't care. 

I guess the top story of the 
year is that we haven't had any 
of those little "threats" that 
plagued the campus last acade- 
mic year. 

What were there, about a 
dozen? Sure, we'll always have 
parking issues, but the threats 
affected almost everyone. 



1 guess some of us have 
grown up over the year. Either 
that or those responsible finally 
realized what immature jerks 
they were and shut it down 
themselves. For this, we thank 
you. 

Losers of Ihe Year: Actually. 
1 have several. Bill Gates (just 
'cause he's rich and deviant), 
Backstreet Boys (in fact, all 
white R &amp; B groups). Jerry 
Springer, people who don't 
recycle, tobacco companies, 
Ohio State's football team, 
Disney (I just like picking on 
them), Mark Souder (still thinks 
homosexuals arc from another 
planet), racists (of ALL kinds), 
Dennis Rodman. Tommy 
Hilfiger (lost S200 million in 
last quarter-l know, I couldn't 
believe it either after being in 
this town), people with urinat- 
ing car stickers (what arc you. 
nine years old?). Fox Television 
(except "That 70's Show," 
"King of the Hill." and "The 
Simpson's.") anything to do 
with "Beanies." and finally, 
shows such as "Entertainment 
Tonight" and "Extra." 

It's no wonder American 
teens are so dumb, they actually 
think that these talking heads 
are giving them news. 

I weep for the future. Be 
nice, have a joyous Christmas.

Birth of a Hero, Part Three: A Break in Procedure 



by Adam Toy lor 

Features Editor 



The chill of winter found three 
young men huddled outside a teni 
door. 

Patiently the men wailed lo 
receive word on the condition of the 
sick man inside the tent, and ner- 
vously they whispered hack and 
forth their concern for the man. 

The man was their leader, their 
spiritual father, and their inspiration 
to be better warriors. The man, how- 
ever, was going to die. 

Close to evening, the three 
heard a voice protrude from inside 
the lent, startling them all 'Ttrin? 
flilioka? Polonka? Go summon the 
Great Council. Ramosca is dead." 

Upon hearing these words, sobs 
went out from those within the 
vicinity of the tent where the faJIcn 
leader lay. 

For many years Ramosca had 
led the Azou people through many 
hardships and numerous battles, and 
now he would lead them no more. 

Illness claimed the life of one of 
the greatest leaders the Azou had 
ever had, and despite how difficult 
his death may have been to gel over, 
a greater challenge now lay before 
bis former followers. 

Now was the lime to choose the 
person great enough to succeed 
Ramosca as chief of the Azous. 

The cuslom by which a new 
leader was selected daied back ear- 
lier than anyone could recall. 

ll seemed as though they had 
been using the same custom since 
the beginning of time. 

The 12 men of the Greal 
Council would convene and debate 
amongst themselves for as long as it 
took 10 come up with the proper 
nominees. 

An election would then be held 
within the Council with the person 
receiving the least amount of votes 
being dropped and a re -vole being 
issued. 

This process would continue 
until finally there would be one man 
left. This man would be chief. 

It was a rather bizarre system, but 
it worked fairly well. Never before 
had il given ihcm any problems. 

This was the system that elected 
Ramosca. after all, and Ramosca 
had maintained a near god-like sta- 
tus during the many years he was in 
power. 

1 le never abused his right to rule 
over the Azou people and always 
did ihc best he could 10 further the 
interests of his followers, not only 
because the Great Council would 
vote him out if he didn't but because 
he was generally concerned with the 
welfare of his people. 

His mind was a molding of all 
of the wisdom that came before him 
and his heart was a combination of 
every Azou's feelings. 



His ability to speak and think 
for the rest of the tribe with such 
effectiveness made him nearly irre- 
placeable. 

In the top contenders for his suc- 
cessor, however, there was hope. 
Many people had become nominat- 
ed by the Great Council, but it all 
basically boiled down to two people 
whom everyone knew could run the 
tribe effectively and 
successfully. 

Those two were Tirin and 
Polonka. the fearless warriors and 
bitter rivals that were charged wilh 
guarding the tent of Ramosca in his 
final days. 

Tirin and Polonka both would 
have been excellent chiefs had they 
both been given the opportunity. 

Both could lead effectively, 
both could fight, and both were gift- 
ed with the ability 10 think on high- 
er levels than everyone else. 

The problem was. though, that 
even though both were more than 
suitable for the task, only one could 
be chosen. And since ihey were both 
so worthy of leadership, it was 
going to be a close vote. 

The results of the voting went 
exactly as everyone had anticipated, 
with Polonka and Tirin being ihc 
finalists. 

This caused a great deal of 
stress for the Great Council, as Ihey 
knew that it would be hard 10 distin- 
guish between the two and that 
whatever vote was made would be a 
close decision. The two were that 
much alike. 

Instead of going straight into the 
voting, a proposal was made that ihc 
situation they were facing was one 
in which greal thinking would have 
lo come into play. 

1 Tie Council was being made to 
choose between two men who were 
nearly identical to each other in 
every personality aspect lhal could 
be measured by the naked eye. 

They were going 10 have to 
devise a lest of some sort instead of 
having a final vote in order 10 deter- 
mine the better of the two. 

That would be the only way 
they could all live with their deci- 
sion in good conscience. 

After much deliberation, a fight 
to ihe death was announced where 
the winner would be crowned the 
new leader and the loser buried with 
all of the honors of a fallen hero. 

Polonka grew excited upon 
hearing ibis news, as be believed he 
could easily defeat Tirin in such a 
match, and Tirin grew nervous. 

He had no problem fighting 
Polonka, bul he couldn't imagine 
taking the life of a fellow tribesman. 

Thai was completely against 
everything he had learned from 
Ramosca, who had always taught 
him never 10 light his own people. 

It was better lo concentrate on 
the real enemy, those who wished 
to destroy the Azou. Less men to 
fight was always more strategically 



sound, after all. 

Something else about the fight 
bothered him, though. 

He could remember when he 
and Polonka were little boys, play- 
ing games together with Bilioka out 
in the woods and laughing all day. 

He could remember the first 
Great Feast ihey hunted together 
for and how they caught the biggest 
game that day, despite being die 
youngest. 

Mast of all, Tirin could remem- 
ber all of the times he was made to 
outdo Polonka as a matter of pride, 
causing Tirin to improve himself 
each and every time as a result. 

Had he not had Polonka as his 
competitor while growing up, Tirin 
would never be the person he was 
that day. 

With this in mind, Tirin went 
before the Great Council just min- 
utes before his bout with Polonka. 

Polonka had his knife sharpened 
and hanging at his side, face painted 
and ready for batile, whereas Tirin 
was wearing whai one would wear 
in leisure time. 

Addressing the Council. Tirin 
somberly said, "The man you 
expect me to kill today is my enemy 
in many regards. He is my rival as 
well as in the way of my being 
chief. 

"He is also an Azou, though, 
and just the same my friend, (refuse 
10 fight anyone 1 am so connected 
to. Polonka can be chief if il means 
enough to him 10 destroy me. I 
respectfully withdraw." 

As Tirin said this, a look of 
bewilderment befell upon those pre- 
sent. 

They had assembled to sec an 
Azou kill another Azou to become 
their new leader, and they were all 
deprived of this. 

The Great Council met quickly 
wilh each other and discussed the 
latest development wilh grcai fer- 
vor, trying to ascertain the most fea- 
sible idea. 

Finally, an agreement was 
reached and ihey went before the 
village. 

"During the pasi few days." the 
spokesman said, " we have attempt- 
ed to find a leader with those traits 
that made Ramosca the great man 
that he was. Unfortunately, until 
today, we have failed. However, 
Tirin's compassion and concern for 
his fellow tribesman, despite what 
ihe circumstances were, have lead 
us to believe that the heart of 
Ramosca is alive within Tirin He 
embodies all that which makes an 
ideal Azou warrior and leader. My 
fellow tribesman, meet Tirin, your 
new warrior chief." 

As these words were uttered by 
ihe spokesman of the Greal Council, 
ihe whole crowd went wild. 

Tirin nearly fainted as they put 
him forth to view his new family. 
Tirin's firsl best destiny had finally 
been realized.

As the World-Wide-Web Turns: 

Furby assassination heads holiday theme 



by Vincent Garcia 



Staff Writer 

Hello once again, fellow readers, and welcome 10 
my holiday edition of. do I even have a name for these 
articles? Let's just go with the holiday ediiion of web 
pages. 

I went surfing recenUy and picked up some inter- 
esting Chrisunas-lype stuff. Remember a few weeks 
ago when I wrote about ihe "Furby Autopsy" sile? 

Well. Furby has more pain 10 put up with on the 
internet with "Assassinate Furby." 

Generally, this is as bad as it sounds, but ihe Furby 
is animated so hilariously that 1 just couldn't resist 
putting it in here. 

Some of the other sites are more in ihe holiday spir- 
it, but not by much. 

I didn't do Ihe student pages due to lack of 
response, lack of entertainment in the pages (except 
mine and Mr, Diehl's), and frankly lack of motivation 
on my pan. Anyways, here's what you've been wailing 
for. 

http://www.uselessknowl- 
edge.com 

This site was enlcrtaining to say ihe least. I pride 
myself on being a good test taker, and even better if the 
test is multiple choice. 

To tell you the truth, I'm not sure if the verbal sec- 
tion on my SAT was in the English language, yet I still 
managed a 610, so this was the ultimate challenge for 

1 ended up with an 8 out or 15 on the firsl (wo lev- 
els of the lest on this site, then I bombed out wilh a 5 
out of 15 on ihe expen level. Still. I only knew about 3 
for sure on the firsl Iwo and one on Ihe last. 

All test-takers or those who consider themselves 
"smart" should try these quizzes. 

Other features include random facts and quoics. 
Sorry about the lack of Christmas orientation, but I 
didn't want to put this sile off. 

http://www.wackyuses.com 

Are you having irouble finding the right gift for 
someone? 

Would you just rather give your 
girlfriend/boyfriend something you already have 
because you rank just behind Scrooge in being cheap? 

Fear not, for this sile is the path to enlightenment. 
Is your boyfriend trying to quit smoking bul just can't? 

Jusi tell him 10 shut up and pop in some 
Alka-Sellzer after every meal to ward off those nicoiine 



cravings. 

Girlfriend needs some conditioner? If you've got 
Redi-Whip laying around the house, problem solved. 

Just apply for 30 minutes, rinse, shampoo, and 
that's it. Won't ihey admire you for being prudent? 

Jewelry and expensive gifts are out; long live the 
cheap. 

http://www-server.bcc.ac.uki/ 
~zcap161/santa.html 

What are some of the greaicsi mysteries of all time? 

The Bermuda Triangle? 

J.F.K.'s assassination? 

Why my anicle wasn't printed last week? 

How aboui whether or not St. Nick actually exists? 

All right, maybe not. bui this is still a funny site to 
see. This site l found last year when I was in a high 
school Physics class. 

Someone had brought it in for a iree we had in the 
room around Christmas lime. 

This page is a listing of reasons why Santa couldn't 
exist. 

These are mostly reasons having to do wilh 
Physics, like energy (poor Si. Nick would receive sev- 
eral billion Joule, enough to combust the jolly old guy) 
or mass (ihe sheer mass of the presents would be more 
than any genetically warped reindeer could handle). 

I don't know why I get a kick out of that page, but 
a year later, I Mill love it. A must-see for all science stu- 
dents. 

http://www.newgrounds.com 
/assassin/furby brief.html 

This is Ihe site I was talking about, Ihe assassination 
of the little furball rodent Furby. 

At me current umc, the Java-enhanced site allows 
you to beat on the poor fella in two different ways, both 
incredibly cruel. 

One is by ripping ihc critter's ears off. When this 
happens, the thing makes this face that could entertain 
the Pope. 

Another Ihing to do is stuff Furby into a microwave 
and watch as he puffs up like a marsh ma How. 

Beware: mis sile isn't for the squeamish or for those 
who arc morally upright. 

Well, I don't have much more to say. This web page 
column probably won't be going on much longer so I 
just want to thank my loyal readcr(s). thanks mom. 

Anyway, I hope through these sites you have 
learned a way to entertain yourself when you should 
have been studying for an important test. I know [ have.

Athletic Director accepts job at Southern Colorado 



IPFW athletics may have suffered its biggest 
loss in school history. 
Stanley "Buich" Perehan, athletic 
director, has decided to accept a position as 
athletic director at Southern Colorado 
University. 

He has been Athletic Director here 
ai IPFW for the last four years and has been an alhlcl- 
ic director in northeast Indiana for the last 25. 

"IPFW holds a special place in my heart, I'll miss 
the friends that I've encountered throughout my 
tenure and the teamwork that our staff has shown." 

In his reign he has made startling improvements. 
He has not only put extraordinary athletic teams 
together but has also emphasized the importance of 
academics 

His list also includes developing the McKay prop- 
erty from what used to be empty farmland into some 
of the finest athletic facilities this area has seen. 

He has also done a superb job bringing the 
Summit City Shootout to the Gates Sports Center and 
cross country back to IPFW in three intensive meets, 
including the IPFW Invitational, the Randall &amp; 
Sullivan "Fund Run" and the Mastodon Stomp. 

Perehan has also brought the mens volleyball 
NCAA final four to Fori Wayne and brought Olympic 
Volleyball to IPFW in the USA-France and USA- 
Japan volleyball games. 

He is also one of the individuals responsible for 
bringing Norman Schwarzkopf and Colin Powell to 
speak to an IPFW audience 

Powell and Schwart/kopf are the epitome of what 
IPFW athletics is all about: leadership, courage, and 
teamwork. 

Perehan also fielded a womens Soccer team for 
the 1999 season. 

What is Perehan proud of most? 

"I'm proud of the progression and competitive- 
ness IPFW has showed in the last few years," Perehan 
said. "All of our teams are very competitive and com- 
pete for conference championships year in and year 
out," 

Perehan will take his wife Dorothy and his empty 
nest to Southern Colorado University where he feels 
the teams will be able to compete right away. 

"This is a 'golden opportunity' for me at this stage 
of my life," he said. "Although, I will miss IPFW and 
Fort Wayne a great deal." 

Golden Opportunity??? 



"IPFW holds a 

special place in 

my heart , /'// miss 

the friends that 

I've encountered 

throughout my 

tenure and the 

teamwork that our 

staff has shown"

Perehan says, "Pueblo, Colorado does not have 
minor league teams such as the Fury, KomeLs. and 
Wizards In fact, Pueblo has only five high schools, so 
the upside is that Southern Colorado is the pride of 
Pueblo." 

Which in turn means Perehan will become "the 
pride of Pueblo." 

Sounds like a movie. ..Unfortunately, for the Dons 
it will become a reality in early April. 

"I am very honored and proud to say that I am a 
part of IPFW athletics. I am pleased to sec the direc- 
tion in which this program is beaded and the results 
we have accumulated in the past years," Perehan said. 

"This is an opportunity I sought out. I talked to 
my wife about it, and with good fortune I made it into 
the final selection and was finally selected," Perehan 
said. "USC will not have mens volleyball or cross 
country, and you can bet I will miss them. However, 
add wrestling, mens and womens golf and I think it 
will be an exciting year. USC has a beautiful baseball 
stadium and IS lighted tennis courts, a basketball gym 
that seats 5800 and is usually filled with 3500 plus It 
also houses residence halls which will be more 
appealing to student athletes." Perehan said. 

Not only does USC have first-class facilities, but 
now they have a first-class athletic director. 

You can bel USC is going to reap the benefits of 
IPFW's best.

Super Saturday upsets stir new controversy in 3CS 



Staff Writer 

Whai could possibly exceed the excite- 
ment generated by last weekend's college 
football action? 

How nboul round two or a playoff 
system? The travesty also known as the 
Bowl Championship Scries IOCS) has taint- 
ed what is arguably the best sport around. 

After the dust settled last Saturday, only 
Tennessee was left standing with their 
unblemished record intact after defeating 
Mississippi St. 24-14 in the SEC title game. 

The other two teams weren't as lucky. 
UCLA lost the most exciting game of the 
season 10 Miami 49-45 and Kansas State 
blew a 1 5-point fourth quarter lead to Texas 
A&amp;M to eventually lose 36-33 in double 



With Tennessee the only legitimate 
unbeaten team (sorry Tulane), Horida Slate 
backdeored their way into a championship 
matchup with the Volunteers in Tempc, 
Arizona, on Jan. 4. 

Essentially the DCS has validated the 
premise that an early loss to an unranked 
team (FSU to NC Si.) is belter ihan a later 
loss to an unranked team (Ohio St. lo 
Michigan Si.). 

Although strength of schedule plays a 
large pan and Florida Stale's was more 
difficult, this mathematical equation is no 
way to match the top teams. 

We now have seven teams with one loss 
and one with none. This sounds like the 
perfect number for a playoff. 

Instead, Tennessee and FSU will play in 
Tempe and all of the other bowl 
games are meaningless, Sure, I'll 
watch some of them, but none will 
have any impact on the 
championship. 

Imagine Tennessee, FSU, Ohio 
Si, Kansas St., UCLA, Florida. 
Texas A&amp;M and Wisconsin in an 
eight-team playoff. WHY 
NOT???? Now it appears thai the 
BCS works, after ail it matched the 
top two teams in the country. 

Like every other facet of life, 
money and politics rear their ugly 
head in the BCS. Along with the 
conference champs, the BCS gels 
lo pick two at-largc teams. 

Ohio Slate and Kansas Slate, 
both with only one loss, seemed 
like a lock. 

However, I didn't know thai 



tourism was a factor. Gainesville, Florida, is 
much closer to Miami than Manhattan, 
Kansas, and the likelihood of Florida fans 
traveling to the Orange Bowl is greater, 
even though Florida's two losses came at 
the hands of Iwo pretty good teams. 
Tennessee and Florida St. 

The decision of the BCS to slight 
Kansas Stale was a costly one for the 
Wildcats. Instead of the Sll-13 million 
Orange Bowl payday, the Wildcats will col- 
lect S1.1 million in their much anticipated 
Alamo Bowl matchup with Purdue. 

I'm not a math major, but that's a S10 
million shaft. 

One player who won't get the shaft is 
Texas' Ricky Williams. 

In ihe Longhorn's day after 
Thanksgiving classic wiih rival Texas 
A&amp;M, Ricky locked up the He ism an 
Trophy with a 259-yard performance 
against one of die nation's top defenses in 
his last regular season game as a Longhom. 

In addition lo leading Texas to an upset. 
he shattered Tony Dorscll's NCAA career 
rushing mark. The other candidates, 
UCLA's Cade McNown and Kansas State's 
Michael Bishop, lost any chance at the 
Hcisman as well as a shot at the national 
championship in the span of two hours. 

NFL STRETCH RUN 

Rarely is it possible to match the 
excitement on Sunday lhat the college game 
produces on Saturday, but this season has 
produced a mysteriously good season for 
the NFL 

Denver and Minnesota have a combined 
record of 25-1 and appear to be destined to 



meet in the Super Bowl. After that it is any- 
one's guess, though. 

In the NFC, Atlanta is already in the 
playoffs, but until they win in January, no 
one will take them seriously. Forty-four year 
old Sieve DcBerg has had to step in at times 
for injury-prone Chris Chandler at QB. 

Dallas still leads football's worst divi- 
sion despite only having one victory in their 
last three games. San Francisco and Green 
Bay as wild-card (earns? It's a definite 
possibility. 

Free agent defections and injuries have 
taken their toll on the NFC's perennial pow- 
erhouses. The final wild card spot is up for 
grabs, and a .500 record should get either 
Arizona, Tampa Bay or New Orleans in. 

In the AFC, Denver is still doing their 
New York Yankees impression, rolling over 
the competition at 13-0, although they had a 
scare against the Chiefs this weekend. 

All you have to know is that Many 
Schottenheimer is the coach on the sideline 
opposile John Elway and you'll know the 
Broncos will pull it 
out. 

In their final i 
three games, the • 
Broncos travel to ■ 
New York to face the i 
Giants, to Miami for 
a Monday night 
game, then back 
home to host Seaiile 
and close out the 
season. 

The AFC East j 
remains a log jam \ 
with four teams (a 
but Indianapolis 



within a game of first place. 

Jacksonville should win the Central bui 
they lost QB Mark Brunell to an ankle 
injury last weekend. 

That leaves Pittsburgh, Tennessee and 
Oakland fighting with the three AFC East 
teams left for for the wildcards scraps. 

I would be remiss not to mention the 
officiating in ihe NFL this season. Earlier 
this week, the league had mentioned the 
possibility of resurrecting instant replay in 
time of ihe playoffs. 

A good idea, but that's a little like 
locking ihe bam door after the horses have 
been stolen. Also stolen may be some 
teams' chances ai ihe playoffs thanks to 
shoddy officiating. 

"Coin-gaie" cosi the Stcclers a chance 
on Thanksgiving. 

The Bills got hosed on a Hail Mary pass 
interference call. 

Seattle clearly stopped Vinny 
Tesiaverde short of a touchdown, yet the 
refs gave ii lo him. 



All three of these learns are on the play- 
off bubble, and those calls could keep them 
from gelling in. Instant replay is a 
no-brainer. 

You see it all the time. A "zebra" is in 
the perfect position to make a call, yet he 
misses it or makes the wrong call. 

The speed at which the game moves as 
well as all of the bodies colliding simultane- 
ously makes it difficult to look for things 
like possession and whether or not a player 
is in bounds or not. With the resource of 
technology, including the multitude of cam- 
era angles, a designated replay official 
would be able to reverse missed calls 
without impeding the progress of the game. 

Ibere are kinks that need to be worked 
out, such as the number of reviews per half 
and judgment calls, like pass interference. 

However. I don't think we'll see instant 
replay this season and I don't think the coin 
toss falls under plays eligible for review. It 
doesn't hurt to hope for it, though.
