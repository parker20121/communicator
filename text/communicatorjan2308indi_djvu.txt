IRISH IMMERSION FESTIVAL 2008 



BySAIDEL-D/UANI 

cIdunOISipfw.edu 



When long time 
traveler, festival par- 
ticipant and Irish native 
Caoimhe (pronounced 
Keeva) McNeil decided 
last year that an Irish fes- 
tival in Fort Wayne was in 
order, she executed. Six 
weeks, including winter 
brealc, was all il took for 
her to organize and put 
together the first annual 
Irish Immersion Festival 
here in Fort Wayne. Ex- 
pecting only about 100 
people to show, the fes- 
tival brought in 700, run- 
ning out of food in three 
hours and becoming the 
biggest IPFW student or- 
ganization event of the 
year. 

"After a couple 
months, i get an itch. 
Festivals are all I know - 
I've been doing them my 
whole life," McNeil said 



on her experience with 
the Irish festival circuit 
and desire lo bring one 
to Fort Wayne, especially 
during the "off season." 

Fort Wayne, which 
serves as a cross road to 
many cities the festival 
has landed, has been 
ignored for years. The 
recendy emerged Irish 
community has spent the 
last 12 months improv- 
ing last years event, co- 
ordinating with the city 
and outside resources to 
produce an even larger 
and hopefully more suc- 
cessful festival. 

The Retuning Adults 
Honor Society, also 
known as Omicron Psi, 
is the IPFW organization 
behind this festival, lead 
by president, McNeil. 

The organization was 
formed under the ba- 
sis that returning adults 
were not as involved 
because of their busy 
schedules, yet were ac- 



tive with community 
service. Omicron Psi as- 
serts that it's necessary to 
recognize students who 
excel academically and 
contribute service and 
charitable work. With 
these qualifications, the 
organization dedicates 
its lime to helping two 
organizations every year: 
one local and the other 
international. 

This year, the group 
is supporting the Center 
for Non - Violence. For a 
mission statement and 
more information re- 
garding the organization, 
visit www.c enter fornon - 
violence.com. 

Eagle Creek is the 
current project that Omi- 
cron Psi is helping, ful- 
filling the international 
mandate. Eagle Creek is 
five acres dedicated by 
an organization known 
as Adventure Leadership 
Training (ALT), that aims 
to provide opportuni- 



ties for those who are 
engaged in youth work 
to achieve skills and na- 
tional qualifications in 
outdoor pursuits. For the 
Eagle Creek promotional 
video online, visit www. 
myspace.com/irishim- 
mersionfestival. 

Kicking off the fes- 
tival is a night out at IK 
O'Donnel's, Fort Wayne's 
Irish Ale House on Ian. 25 
from 6 to lam. 
The pub, established in 
2007, ivill feature three 
bands, a professional 
storyteller, and origi- 
nal poetry reading from 
IPFW students. There 
will be opportunities lo 
win prizes along with 
free ride home tickets 
distributed by the city of 
Fort Wayne. The Hilton 
downtown is also spon- 
soring the festival offer- 
ing $117 per room and 
will not be charging oc- 
cupancy. 

"Get four people and 



it's like $28 apiece. You 
can party at IK's and not 
have 10 drive," said Mc- 
Neil. 

The Hilton is just one 



and a half blocks from 
tlie pub and will offer 
shutdc services to and 
from the festival the fol- 
lowing day.

A dream celebration at IPFW 



By Marisha Zimmerman 

On Sunday, |an. 20, 
IPFW hosted "A Dream 
Celebration" at Rhine- 
hart Recital Hall. 

The event marks the 
beginning of a month 
and a half long celebra- 
tion of African-American 
history at IPFW. It was 
an evening of music that 
celebrated the life, lead- 
ership, and faith of Dr. 
Manin Luther King, Jr. 

The performance was 
opened by IPFW's own 
ensemble, Voices of In- 
spiration, and featured 
the African -American 
Choral Ensemble of In- 
diana University. The 
musical talent of the Af- 
rican-American Choral 
Ensemble was truly un- 
mistakable with a range 
of voices that represent- 
ed a diverse group. 

The ensemble per- 
formed mostly spiritual 



and gospel songs, such 
as "When 1 Get There," 
"Oh My Soul Loves Je- 
sus," and "Soon-ah Will 
Be Done," that showed 
the group's musical tal- 
ent and expressed the 
mixing of faith and free- 
dom that was lUartin Lu- 
ther King Ir.'s dream for 
African Americans. 

The event was more 
than just a tribute to 
Manin Luther King Ir., 
it was also a tribute to 
his inspiring and radical 
thinking and dreams that 
helped to change Ameri- 
ca into a more free and 
diverse country. 

The event was at- 
tended by many students 
and visitors from the 
community, including 
the president of the Fort 
Wayne chapter of the 
NAACR Pastor Michael 
L Latham, and the Vice 
Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs at IPFW, Susan 
Hannah.

ObamaandRomney«u 

Same question, very different answers 





How can I invest when I'm 

drowning in debt? 



By EDWARD NELSON 

nelseaOI@iphv.edu 



Barack Obama and 
Mitt Romney have both 
found themselves in 
contention to ivin their 
party's nominations by 
representing very differ- 
ent platforms. 

While Obama con- 
tinues to promise Amer- 
ica change, Romney, ac- 
cording lo The 

New York Times, 
is trying lo bring 
together the 
same coalition 
of Republicans 
that elected 
Ronald Reagan 
and George W. 
Bush. 

Thai two candidates 
could be so different 
from each other yet both 
remain in the spotlight 
suggests a lot about

Highways more dangerous than terrorism 

How mismanaged government spending endangers our lives 




By DOUGLAS SCHMIDT 

KhmilnDieiipFw.edu 



In a recent poll, 9D 
percent of IPFW students 
said that if there were 
a danger that killed 14 
times as many people 
annually as the Sept. 
11 attacks, the govern- 
ment should spend more 
money hghting that dan- 
ger than fighting terror- 
ism. Similarly, 90 per- 
cent of students said that 
the government should 
spend the most money 
on the higgest dangers 
to American lives. Ap- 
parently, our leaders in 
Washington disagree. 

Americans are far 
more likely to die in 
automobile accidents 
than to be killed by ter- 



rorists. Nearly 3,000 American lives, but gov- 

people were killed by emment spending does 

the Sept. 11 attacks, not reflect this concern. 

In 2005, 43.443 people Last week, the House 

were killed in traffic passed a new national 

accidents. Judging by defense bill authorizing 



"If terrorists were causing 
43,000 deaths a year, Americans 
would demand that the govern- 
mcfrit do something about it. " 



the number of deaths 
on American soil, our 
roads are a far greater 
danger than terrorism. 
They would be 14 times 
more dangerous even if 
the Sept. II attacks were 
repeated every year. 

Our leaders may be 
concerned with saving 



S696 billion in spending, 
including S169 billion to 
continue the wars in Iraq 
and Afghanistan. How- 
ever, the President is only 
requestinga budget of $67 
billion for the Department 
ofTransportaiion. 

How could increasing 
the spending on roads 



save lives? One possi- 
bility is replacing sig- 
naled intersections ivith 
roundabouts. According 
to the 1\imer-Fairbank 
Highway Research Cen- 
ter, roundabouts like the 
one on the IPFW cam- 
pus have been proven 
to reduce injuries from 
automobile accidents. 
Roundabouts eliminate 
right angle, left turn, and 
head-on crashes. Tiie 
slower speed gives driv- 
ers more time to react 
to threats and reduces 
the damage caused by 
crashes. 

The Department of 
TVansportalion states 
that roundabouts lead 
to a 90 percent reduc- 
tion in fatal crashes and 
a 76 percent reduction in 
injury-causing crashes. 



Additionally, not having 
to wait for a traffic light 
to change also improves 
the flow of traffic. 

Another possibility is 
redesigning roads with 
more "traffic calming" 
features. Adding more 
bike lanes, crosswalks, 
cul-de-sacs and simUar 
features would encour- 
age drivers to slow doivn 
and pay closer attention 
to the road. Design fea- 
tures hke these would 
cut the number of auto- 
mobile accidents, reduce 
the burden on our na- 
tion's health care system 
and, most importantly, 
save lives. 

If terrorists were 
causing 43,000 deaths a 
year, Americans would 
demand that the gov- 
ernment do something 
about it. So why does 



the government spend 
so much more money 
on national defense and 
hghting terrorism when 
automobile accidents are 
a far greater danger? 

The answer may be 
fear. However tragic a 
car accident may be, it is 
simply not as frightening 
as the thought of a ter- 
rorist attack. 

In an article called 
"Do we fear the right 
things?" David Meyers, 
professor of psychology 
at Hope College, writes, 
"it's time to check our 
fears against facts... To 
be prudent is to be mind- 
ful of the realities of how 
humans die. By so doing, 
we can take away the ter- 
rorists' most omnipres- 
ent weapon: exaggerated 
fear."

Huckabee's worrisome ties 

to an extremist movement 



By ALARLC DEARMENT 



Americans love 

a rebel. Whether it's 
George Washington or 
Elvis Presley, we have 
a fixation with rabble 
rousers. Perhaps this 
explains the popularity 
of Republican candi- 
date Mike Huckabee. 

Muckabee sticks 
it to the man. While 
the other Republi- 
can candidates are as 
enthralled with . the 
ultra-wealthy as the 
Bush administration. 
Huckabee talks about 
poverty and calls the 
pro-business Club for 
Growth the "Club for 
Greed." He even won 



praise from arch-lib- 
eral columnist David 
Sirota. 

Huckabee's history, 
however, shows him 
to be anything hut Che 
Guevara. 

Washington Post 
columnist Robert No- 
vak wrote that Hucka- 
bee attended a Dec. 18 
fundraiser at the Hous- 
ton home of Steven Ho- 
tze, a prominent figure 
in Reconstructionism, 
an obscure but influ- 
ential Christian politi- 
cal movement started 
by the late R.J. Rush- 
doony in the 1960s. 

Reconstructionists 
lake religious right ide- 
ology to the extreme, 
seeking to turn the U.S. 
into a iheacracy gov- 



erned according to Old willing to sacrifice to 

Testament law, com- obey his command- 

plete with stoning of menis and adminis- 

adulterers and execu- trate his laws, no mat- 

tion of homosexuals, ter the personal cost," 

"Reconstructionists take reli- 
gious right ideology to the ex- 
treme, seeking to turn the U.S. 
into a theocracy governed accord- 
ing to Old Testament law" 



Imagine a Christian 
version of Iran, and 
you've got the idea of 
what the Reconstruc- 
tionists want for this 
country. 

"The seats of our 
civil government must 
be filled by men who 
fear God and who are 



Hotze said in a 1990 
audio clip. 

Huckabee's ties to 
Reconstructionists 
don't stop with Hotze's 
fundraiser. In 199B. 
he co-wrote the book 
"Kids Who Kill: Con- 
fronting Our Culture of 
Violence" with anoth- 



er Reconstructionist, 
George Grant. 

According to Moth- 
er tones magazine, 
Huckabee wrote in 
the 1998 book, "It is 
now difficult to keep 
track of the vast array 
of publicly endorsed 
and institutionally 

supported aberrations 

— from homosexual- 
ity and pedophilia to 
sadomasochism and 
necrophilia." * 

He has also refused 
to retract a 1992 state- 
ment he [iiade to the 
Associated Press in 
which he called homo- 
sexuality "an aberrant, 
unnatural and sinful 
lifestyle." 

- Inl987,Grantwrote 
a book titled "The 



Changing of the Guard: 
Biblical Principles for 
Political Action." 

In that book, Grant 
wrote, "(l)t is domin- 
ion we are after. Not 
just a voice. It is do- 
minion we are after. 
Not just influence. It is 
dominion we are after. 
Not just equal time. 
It is dominion we are 
after. World conquest. 
That's what Christ has 
commissioned us to 
accomplish." 

Aside from Novak's 
column, a post on the 
libertarian Cato In- 
stitute's Web site and 
a few blog entries, 
Huckabee's ties to Re- 
constructionists have 
largely escaped scru- 
tiny.

In the words of

Since the beginning of the Civil Highis movement, many people of different-

quotes from Dr. King himself. 



"7/j the end, we will remember i

"Our lives begin lo end the day we become silent about things that matter." 



"! look forward confidently to the day when all who work for a living will be one

men will not argue that the color of a man's skin determines the content of his

Atonement 



By ANDREW STACKHOUSE 

icyrain6hoImaJI.com 

Based on the book 
by Ian McEwan, "Atone- 
ment" ruminates on the 
disastrous effects of a lie 
a young girl tells. With it's 
tragic, weaving plot, mas- 



terful directing talent and 
great acting, this movie 
will please any film con- 
noisseur. 

The story opens in- 
nocently enough as it fol- 
lows 13-year-old Briony 
Tallis (played by Saoirse 
RonanI at her famil/s es- 
tate in the hills of Surrey

England. While attempting 
to put on a play for herolder 
bmther, she wimesses the 
romandc tension between 
her older sister Cecilia 
(played by Keira Knightly), 
and the son of their house- 
keeper, Robbie Tlirner 
(played by James McAvoy). 
She soon interrupts a torrid 
meedng between the two, 
which confuses her young 
mind. After her cousin is 
then raped by an unknown 
attacker, Briony accuses 
Robbie of ttiis se.vual crime. 
The film then foUows the 
characters into their sepa- 
rate lives during World War 
li. Cecilia, the only one who 
believed Bobbie was inno- 
cent, is estranged from her 
family as she waits for him 
to return to her. Robbie has 
exchanged time in prison 
forsening in the war. Mean- 
while. Briony has begun to 
realize the totality of her lie 
and strives for atonement 
by working as a nurse. The 
moiie thus foUows the con- 
sequences of lier action and 
tlie steps she takes to make 
amends. 

Director Joe Wright mas- 
terfijUy entwines the sto- 
ries of the main characters 
as they quickly whirl away 
from each other due to the 
all- encompassing gloom of 
World War II. With separate 



Neccessary 



story arcs in three different 
time periods, and transi- 
tions between the three 
main characters, it would 

be easy for the plot to 
flounder in so much detail. 
However, the changes in 
time and place never seem 
off-beat and always lead to 
the audience member ask- 
ing for more. This leads to 
the last scene, which packs 
a dramatic punch. 

"Atonement" also fea- 
tures amazing acting abil- 
ity from it's stars, fames 
McAvoy succeeds in creat- 
ing astrong male character 
diat can also be vulnerable. 
Knightly retains her typical 
on-screen strength, and 
grows into a more mature 
role. Saoirse Ronan shines 
as a young, naJVe girl, and 
this is sure to be a break- 
out role for her. The other 
actors similarly fell into 
their smaller roles to cre- 
ate a well-balanced cast. 

Thougli the heavy dra- 
ma of "Atonement" may 
not please all movie -goers, 
it will surely satisfy anyone 
who enjoys a moving story 
with great acting and di- 
recting. The story will qui- 
edy pull you into the world 
of one girl's lie and leave 
you wondering at tlie limi- 
tations of atoning for one's 
sins.

"CLOVERFIELD'' ^'^^'"g "ntoTheaters 



By ANDREW STACKHOUSE 

icyrainShotmail.com 

Producer!. I.Abram's 
much hyped-about 
"Cloverfield" delivers 
a rollercoaster experi- 
ence. From it's atypical 
cinematography to it's 
won'i-hold-your-hand 
ploiline, the movie re- 
mains different than 
any of the regular di- 
saster-type movies one 
usually sees. The un- 
conventionality of this 
movie will make you 
hate it or love it. 

The plot begins 
with a message stating 
that you, the audience 
member, will be watch- 
ing a video that was re- 
covered from Central 
Park,NewYorkCity.The 
screen then switches 
to a homemade movie 
filmed by a hand-held 
video camera. We start 
with two twenty-some- 
thing lovers, Beth and 
Rob, just beginning 
a day of fun in New 
York. Then the cam- 
era abruptly shifts to 
weeks later when Rob's 
friends, unbeknownst 



to him, are getting 
ready to throw him 
a going away party. 
The video camera has 
fallen into the hands 
of Hud, who amusing- 
ly begins taping the 
party and everyone's 
goodbye to Rob. As 
the young, posh New 
Yorkers get ready to 
party the night away, 
an earthquake shakes 
them into sobriety. 
This earthquake leads 
to explosions in mid- 
town. The party is 
quickly forgotten, and 
chaos ensues. 

The plot of the 
movie may seem con- 
ventional, but it's told 
entirely through the 
lens of a lone video 
camera. The viewer 
isn't given any extra 
knowledge by gov- 
ernment officials 
or clever scientists, 
as the screen never 
shifts from the hands 
of these five friends. 
The audience mem- 
ber learns what's hap- 
pening to New York 
as slowly as the char- 
acters do, so don't ex- 



pect any hand holding. 
In fact, by the end of 
the movie, you won't get 
all the answers to your 
questions. This movie 
follows the happenings 
of the five friends as 
they face disaster, not 
the story of New York's 
demise as a whole. 

The cinematography 
also isn't expert-quality 
and smooth. It feels just 
as jittery and animated 
as a homemade movie 
should. This should act 
as a warning to those 
with queasy stomachs. 
The characters run. They 
also jump, fall, and get 
attacked as well, so the 
screen will swerve just 
as much as they do. The 
experience, while possi- 
bly distracting to some, 
really makes the viewer 
fail even more into the 
story. It pulls you in, 
as the jumbled camera 
movements will cause 
you to feel like you are 
running along with the 
characters. 

The characters them- 
selves are easy to re- 
late to. and the actors 
who portray them do a 



commendable job for 
a group of relative un- 
knowns. The movie will 
not feel like it is being 
acted out. The charac- 
ters react to the mad- 
ness around them just 
like real people pre- 
sumably would. They 
don't always say the 
right thing, and this al- 
lows for realistic awk- 
wardness. It also leads 



good laughs. 
The actors and the 
characters they depict 
truly let you become 
fully immersed in the 
movie. 

With so many good 
things going for it, 
"Cloverfield" is defi- 
nitely a must see, espe- 
cially for anyone who 
enjoys a more unique 
movie experience. This 



movie is all about im- 
mersing yourself in the 
lives of random people 
caught up in a random 
disaster. Don't expect 
a story about heroes 
and villains. This is a 
story about characters 
and their ride through 
New York's fall. Watch 
the movie, and ride 
along with them; it'll 
be bumpy and intense!

Smith commences a 
string of gigs around the 
US including a perfor- 
mance at the Sundance 
Film Festival. 

Boston press day 
scheduled with shows 
in L^. SF and NYC to fol- 
low in support of debut 
solo album "This Town" 
featuring guest appear- 
ances from actor John 
Savage, The Magnetic 



Fields' Claudia Gonson 
and X-ecutioner Rob 
Swift among others. 

"If you find your- 
self a fan of bands like 
Coldplay, Death Cab For 
Cutie, or even Ttavis, you 
should check out what 
Steve Smith has created. 
Underneath this DJ lies a 
musician who had a call- 
ing to record this CD, a 
dream about one of the 
songs, and the enthusi- 
asm to go through with 
it. These are the types 
of musicians 1 respect." 
- Brian Mclrish, Blog 
Critics 

Smith has taken a 
hard right turn from 
the sound that earned 



him tivo Grammys and 
helped him reacfi plati- 
num saJes. At least it 
would seem that way 
when comparing the 
electronica of his hit 
"Days Go By" (VIDEO) 
with the delightful fusion 
of folk and rock sounds 
that comprise his solo 
debut "This Town," out 
February 18lh via the 
artist's own GA.S. Re- 
cordings [named for his 
late father, George Al- 
bert Smith! via RedEye 
Distribution. The first 
2500 copies of the record 
even include an acoustic 
version of "Days Go By" 
which listeners should 
A/B with the original to 



get the clearest picture 
of Smith's evolution. An- 
other bonus cut, "Late 
Nights and Street Fights", 
which was chosen to be 
the main tide theme for 
the FOX-TV hit series. 
Standoff is also included 
at the tail end of This 
Town. 

While Smith's stylistic 
shift in sound may seem 
cut and dried on the sur- 
face, it actually serves to 
reveal that he has been 
a songwriter at heart the 
entire time. "This Town" 
is about as heartfelt as an 
album can get, blending 
folk, rock and electroni- 
ca with Smith's inherent 
songwriiing ability into a 



steady stream of memora- 
ble, affecting tunes about 
Smith's physical and 
spiritual relocation from 
London to Boston . "This 
Town" draws the listener 
in from the start with an 
inspiring monologue by 
acclaimed actor John 
Savage (The Deer Hunt- 
er, Hair), introducing a 
narrative tiiat will repeat 
throughout the rest of the 
album. Life is tough. Or, 
as Savage says so plainly 
at the beginning of the al- 
bum: "Sometimes, being 
a genius is just getting up 
in the morning." 

Especially exciting is 
Smith's upcoming show 
as part of the Sundance 



Film Festival's awards 
party. Smith will be out on 
die road through much of 
the remainder of January 
and February performing 
DJ sets as well as acoustic 
renditions of"ThisTown" 
tunes in major markets as 
he continues to drum up 
attention for the record.

Poppin' Pills Exhibition 

This IS the one time its okay to overdose 



Eminem has supposedly been contacted by Slim- 
Fast. They are trying to contract him as a new spokes- 
person for their products. He recently came out and 
admitted that he recently has been having health 
problems and has put on a "bit" of weight. 

Lindsay L^han has denied being paid to carry 
around Ariva, a smokeless tobacco product that 
comes in both mint and gum forms. It's not a smok- 
ing cessation tool, just a new form of smokeless to- 
bacco. 

It's been reported that Pamela Anderson, who is 
in the process of getting a divorce, is "no longer preg- 
nant." How that has happened, no one is quite sure, 
but we ail have our speculations. 

Britney Spears was photographed buying home- 
pregnancy tests with her new paparazzi boyfriend, 
who just happens to be married. Although there arc 
some odd discrepancies behind the photos. One be- 
ing, her "manager" Osama Luifi, claims that she is 
merely just messing wiili the paparazzi. The other be- 
ing, the photo agency that released the pictures, just 
happens to be the same agency her boyfriend' works 
for. 

Matthew Mcconaughey just announced that he 
and gidfriend Camila Alves are expecting a child. She 
is currentiy three months pregnant. 

Lily Allen's publicist just recentiy announced that 
she has suffered a miscarriage. They are asking for 
privacy during this extremely emotional time in hfe. 

Zac Efron was rushed to the hospital vrith a case 
of appendicitis, he had his appendix removed and is 
said to be doing well. 

Nicole Richie and Joel Madden finally gave birth. 
They had a healdiy baby glri named Harlow Winter 
Kate Madden. 

Christina Aguilera and husband, Jordan Bratman 
also gave birth to a healthy baby boy. Max Liron Brat-

losophy professor Jenni- 
fer Caseldine-Brachi, the

Winter Brights 



By HOPE LAUSTER 



When you typically think of winter, dark colors, bulky coats, heavy sweaters and chunky boots 
come to mind. Most of us dread winter because we Feel like pudgy South Park characters. Why 
not toss the bland rolly-poly look and slip into some bright shades to spice up the snowy season? 

A colorful thick belt is not only figure-flattering, but also a fun way to vamp up any outfit. Try 
adding one to a solid-colored baby-doll dress for an eye-catching affect. 

Bright shoes, whether they are flat or high heels, are very versatile and can easily transform 
any outfit from bland to fab. Achieve a fun look by pairing neon shoes with black tights or jeans. 



However, remember that wearing neon colors from head to toe can be a 
bil much, and therefore should be done In moderation to avoid looking 
like a traffic light. I shouldn't be walking around Macy's and have to put 
on my sunglasses. Mixing in a few colorful accessories to your every- 
day outfits or slicking to one bold piece adds new life to a once boring 
outfit and balances the look. 





Spotlight on campus security 

"Stalker Awareness Month" 

prompts discussion of 

safety issues 



Did you know? 



Sy JESSE CRAIG 

Cfaljjoieaiplw.edu 

This January is the 
fifth annual observance 
of National Stalking 
Awareness Month, Al- 
though "stalking" is a 
term often used in a co- 
medic manner, it is in all 
actuality a serious crime 
that victimizes one out 
of every twelve women 
and one out of forty-five 
men. 

More often than not, 
stalking leads to violent 
or even deadly conse- 
quences. 

Lieutenant Jeff Davis 
sat down and answered 
a few questions and gave 
insight on resources ttiat 
can potentially be help- 
ful to students who do 
not want lo becomL' an- 
other siatislii:. 



In 2007 campus police 
responded to 109 emer- 
gency calls, which con- 
sisted of code blue calls, 
actual emergencies, and 
wrong numbers. There 
were ten arrests made, 
and one of them was an 
alleged rape. 

"WellPFW] have been 
relatively lucky," Lt. Da- 
vis said. 

In order to insure that 
students can continue 
enjoying the safely of 
which they are accus- 
tomed to, police have 
placed approximately 
200 cameras and ■IS code 
blue buttons around 
campus and student 
housing and also offer an 
escort service 24 hours a 
day, 7 days a week, 365 
days a year. 

Safety does not stop at 
mmpus security alone, 




as Lt. Davis leaches a 
Rape Aggression Defense 
(R.A.D.} class held in 
Walb. 

"The two things I em- 
phasize to women [is lo| 
first always be aware of 
your surroundings, and 
second . |to) use good 
risk reduction strategies, 
i.e. walk lo your cars in 
pairs." Davis continues. 

Lt. Davis also added 
that students and teach- 
ers alike should never 
leave their belongings 
unattended or car and 
office doors unlocked. 

There are plenty of 
online resources if one 
would like more in- 
formation on stalking. 
Mark Wynn. a retired 
policeman from Nash- 
ville, has an informative 
website, wiviv.markw- 
ynn.com, ihat provides 
data regarding stalkers 
and what women can do 
to protect themselves. 
If an escort is needed. 
the campus police can be 
contacted by calling 481 - 
6827. 

"One in twelve women 
are victims of stalkers, 
bul ihere are many le- 
gal actions that ihey can 
take to prevent a situ- 
ation from escalating," 
Davis said.

29 kills by IPFW senior opposite Jason

ro the Cougars. At 28-28, IPFW blasted 
a ball that was dug, but headed toward 
the stands. Wliat looked hke a kill, and 
a 29-28 game-point for the Mastodons 
was waived off because ii was ruled that 
a BYU player could not make a play on 
the ball because of crowd interference. 

The replay went lo BYU as senior 
outside hitter Ivan Perez pounded a 
ball straight doivn to the floor, making 
it 29-28 BYU.

of his 22 kills to give the Cougars

Burrows leads men to defining win 



Strong second half showing by senior center, key reserves leads men 
to big victory and movement up the Summit League standings. 



By DAN VANCE 

The Oakland Grizzlies 
were in control of IPFW 
on Saturday: so they 
thought. But that thought 
alone was not enough to 
maintain a halftime lead, 
allowing IPFW to roll to a 
well timed 77-69 win. 

To watch the first and 
second halves, it looked 
like acompletely different 
game for the 2,200 fans in 
attendance. Early on, it 
was aJl Grizzlies, leading 
to a 37-28 halftime lead. 

Jonathan Jones 

penetrated to the basket 
with ease, Erik Kangas 
was hot from behind 
the arc and Shane Lawal 
rendered IPFW's post 
players helpless. 

But all of that 
changed in the second 
half, spurring a 10-0 run 
that eventually led to a 
lie game at 47 after a pair 
of baskets from junior 
David Carson. 

SeniorlaiaunBurraxvs 
was crucial in the second 
half on his way to a 



career-high 23 points 
including a big time slam 
to give the Mastodons a 
67-66 lead.. 

DeWitt Scott was 
unstoppable from deep 
in the second half, hitting 
all four of his three-point 
shots. Scott ended with 
16 points, one of four

Things sure have changed at IPFW 



In All Directions 

By DAN VANCE 

vancdj01@ipfw.edu 



It has been a year and a half since the last time I 
wrote a column in The Communicator. During four 
years at this paper from 20D2-2006, the faces changed 
but the story rarely did. 

Not this time; have things ever changed since 1 
was last here. Gone are the familiar, replaced by a 
conference {and first conference tide for women's 
cross country), a new athletic director and even a 
national runner-up volleyball team. 

But damn is it ever good to be back. 

It felt like home last week writing about the men's 
volleyball team and my longtime favorite coach Arnie 
Ball. It vrill be even better getting to finally see them 
in action this weekend against George Mason. 

And it was really great, though very different, 
to sit at the Memorial Coliseum this weekend and 



watch the Mastodbn men's basketball team run over 
Oakland late with a flurry of offense that I had not 
seen from a Dane Fife team. 

He sure has turned things around and it was 
quite refreshing to watch a team that can honesUy 
compete for a spot in the madness of March's NCAA 
Tournament, 

For people who remember me from a 
Communicator day that seems like ages ago. this first 
column probably seems pretty tame. But, give it time; 
you know I am not always on my best behavior. 

But this IPFW, often unlike the last, seems to be 
miles ahead of where 1 last left things. And as much 
as 1 enjoyed Mark Pope and the old administration. 
Tommy Bell seems to be doing a marvelous job. And 
I personally would rather commend IPFW athletics 
then to bash them. 

Things sure have changed at IPFW, but I am just 
as glad to now be part of the new as I was proud to be 
part of the old. 

And I sure want to keep it that way. 



Still time to 'Buddy Up for Fitness' at Gates 



The Gates Sports Center and The Communicator 
have teamed up to create a resolution of their own- to 
get people into the gym and make it a habit. 

Buddy Up For Fitness! is a new program launched 
byJudyTillapaugh. R.D. 

Coordinator of the wetlness/fitness programs 
at GSC which will pair up those students who are 
interested in fitness, but need someone for support 
and commitment. 

"Tile buddy up system is really good because 
people are more Jikely to go to a fitness center if tiiey 
are meeting someone else who is also interested in 
fitness." saidTillapaugh. 



The program will be a "rolling admission" style, so 
there is no deadline for turning in the buddy up card. 
The sooner the better, however, because the goal is 
for each pair to hit the gym three days every week 
throughout the spring semester. 

"The benefits would be enormous, like de- 
stressing, fiiendships and a stronger body" said 
Tillapaugh. Studies haveshown that it generally takes 
at least a month for most habits to form. 

A form to be filled out and turned into the Gates 
Spons Center information desk was available in last 
week's Communicator and is still available upon 
request in Walb 215.
