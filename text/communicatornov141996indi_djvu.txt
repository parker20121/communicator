to honor founders, 
celebrate milestones 



Students provide 'elegant' dining on campus 



by Jeremy Ecenbarger 
News Editor 

So much for throwing ham- 
burgers on the grill. With falling 
leaves in the air. people may now 
enjoy nights of fine dining. One 
evening of fine dining is being 
offered right on campus. 

On Monday. Nov 18. students 
of John B. Knight, associate pro- 
fessor of the Hotel, Restaurant, and 
Tourism Management program, 
will host the first 1PFW Hospitality 
Ball The event will take place at 6 
p.m. in the WaJb Memorial Union 
Ballroom. 



The students have been work- 
ing with Gregory John, executive 
chef of (he Fort Wayne Country 
Gub. to organize a menu and serve 
the meal. 

The meal will include butter- 
nut squash with cinnamon crisps, 
baby field greens with gorgonzola 
cheese, Nieoise olives and aspara- 
gus with a light balsamic vinai- 
grette, seared with beef tenderloin 
served with a compote of wild 
mushrooms, pearl onions, sweet 
potato, smoked bacon and spice 
pecans. For dessert, there will be 
the "American Bourn," a dried fruit 
cobbler with a flavorful sabayon. 



Tickets cost $45 each. 

Along with the dining, the 
evening will include entertainment 
and dance music by the Bel- Aires 

According to Josh Clapper. 
president of the Hotel. Restaurant 
and Tourism Management student 
club, one focus of the evening will 
be "synchronized service." in 
which four servers, plus a (able 
captain, will set down all the plates 
for a course at once. 

"It's for show." said Clapper. 
"Usually the servers all wear white 
gloves, approach a table together, 
and at the signal of the table cap- 
tain, set down all the plates for a 



course at once. 

Nearly 30 students in all will 
participate in the evening as servers 
or kitchen help. 

Later that night, the presenta- 
tion of the first "Hospitarian 
Award" will take place. The award

Anniversaries are always a time 
for celebration and remembrance 
This year brings the 20th anniver- 
sary of the women's studies pro- 
gram and the Center for Women and 
Returning Adults' 10th anniversary 
on campus. 

Women's courses have been 
taught at IPFW since 1971, but the 
program began offering an academ- 
ic minor in 1976. 

One of the biggest triumphs 
involving women's studies was 
becoming the first state-assisted 
university in Indiana to offer a bach- 
elor's degree in women's studies 

According to Linda C. Fox, 
director of women's studies, more 
than 100 students have graduated 
with minors in women's studies. 

"We have no resident faculty in 
our program." said Fox, explaining 
the challenge of offering different 
courses to allow women's studies 
majors to complete their require- 
ments. "We try to offer nine to ten 
courses per semester. Full-time 
IPFW faculty who leach women's 
studies courses cross list them with 
courses in their own departments 
and we also rely on several very 
excellent associate faculty." 

In celebration of the anniver- 
saries, a luncheon tilled "A Wedge 
of Tune" will feature the history of 
women's issues at IPFW over the 
past 20 years. The event will be 
held on Tuesday, Nov. 19. at noon in 
the Waib Memorial Ballroom. 

The guest speaker of the event 
will be Tem Wonman, field repre- 
sentative for the American 
Association of Retired Persons and 
an IPFW graduate. 

As a student. Worman was a 
double major in history and 
women's studies. She also served as 
the first student coordinator of the 
IPFW Women's Center. 

The celebration will also be an 
opportunity to honor some of the 



people who have made significant 
contributions to women's studies 
and/or the Center for Women and 
Returning Adults. 

Those being honored for their 
contributions in women's studies 
include Jeanette Clausen, chair of 
modem foreign languages and past 
director of women's studies; Judith 
Dilorio, assistant vice chancellor for 
academic affairs and past director of 
women's studies; Donna Middleton, 
equal employment opportunity offi- 
cer; Leslie Raymer. associate facul- 
ty in women's studies; and Joan 
Uebelhoer, feminist, activist, orga- 
nizer and associate faculty in 
women's studies. 

"This is just a chance to honor 
these active women for the last 20 
years," said Christine Zielinski, 
director or the Center for Women 
and Reluming Adults. 

Other women will be awarded 
for their contribution to the Center 
for Women and Returning Adults. 
They include Linda Johnson, past 
coordinator of the Center for 
Women and Returning Adults and 
Terri Worman, first student coordi- 
nator of the Women's Cenier and 
IPFW women's studies graduate. 

"Without Worman's contribu- 
tions the cenier would not have got- 
ten off the ground." said Zielinski. 

Friends of IPFW women's stud- 
ies and ihe Center for Women and 
Returning Adults are invited to 
share in the celebration and lun- 
cheon. 

Tickets are 58 50 for vegetarian 
lasagna, S9.50 for tcriyaki chicken. 

Students not wishing to attend 
the luncheon are welcomed at 12:30 
p.m. to hear the speaker and enjoy 
anniversary cake. 

"We're trying to show that IPFW 
is a university that helps women 
reach all their dreams and goals," 
said Zielinski.

The campaigns came before the 
public; the votes were cast and the 
winner was chosen. 

Presidential candidates Bill 
Clinton, Republican nominee Bob 
Dole and the Reform Party nominee 
Ross Perot were all studied and ana- 
lyzed by the US. population. While 
many were disappointed with the 
final outcome, enough voters fell 
that Clinton carried himself well and 
deserved ihe job for the next four 
years. 

Even though controversy sur- 
rounded him, involving everything 
from Whitewater to campaign contri- 
butions, Clinton managed (o grab 
nearly 50 percent of the vote, enough 




to win. 

In reflection of this year's presi- 



Aftermath: A look at the presidential election 



den Hal race, Michael Downs, chair 
and associate professor of political 
science; Eric Ledbctter, a senior in 
political science; and Marian 
Zimmerman, dean of students, were 
asked bow they felt about the elec- 
tion, Perot's involvement and how 
they think Clinton will handle the 
next four years. 

"I admire Bob Dole a great deal, 
but Clinton bad a belter grip on what 
I'd like to see in the next four years," 
said Downs. 

Clinton was criticized for not 
delivering on all of his 1992 cam- 
paign promises Bui be emphasized 
(he changes be did make and his 
efforts to build a strong economy. He 
pointed out that he worked with wel- 
fare reform, supported federal stu- 
dent loans and passed the Assault 
Weapons Ban. Ledbetter thinks 
Clinton will try to make changes in 
the next four years for which he can 
be remembered. 

"I think he'll try to solidify his 
place in history," said Ledbetter 



"He'll turn more toa foreign policy." 
Ledbetter feels that Clinton really 

has no big plan. He thinks Clinton 

will "tackle" issues as they come up. 

Furthermore, he thinks he'll 

act as a type of mediator, 

e n c o u 

Democrats and 

Republicans 

work together. 
Claiming 

43 percent of 

the popular 

vote, Dole 

became a 

strong competi- 
tor in the race, 

despite jokes made 

by comedians about 

his age. Zimmerman 

said Dole picking 

Kemp for a running mate didn't 

help him in ways that it could have. 
"I'm not surprised that Dole did- 
n't win. I don't think he ran a very 

good campaign," said Zimmerman. 

"I thought Kemp would be stronger 



than he was and pull the campaign 
together, but he didn't. That was very 
disappointing." 

Finally, there was Perot, 
financed the bulk 
of bis campaign 
though 
claimed 
19 percent 




recei 
10 percent 
'of the vote 
election. 
'He was Ihe one 
who was willing to talk 
about reform and campaign contri- 
butions. Clinton and Dole just sort of 
beat around the issues," said Downs. 
Zimmerman believes Perot's lack 
of political past lowers his credibili- 



ty as a candidate. 

"I don't feel be had any effect on 
this election," said Zimmerman. "I 
don't think he was very credible. 
Maybe if he had been elected to 
some olher office previously and bad 
served his country in some son of 
way that would have made a differ- 
ence." 

With Clinton keeping his job as 
president, and Perot still working as 
a businessman, it's not clear what 
Dole will do now that he's retired 
from the Senate. Ledbetter said Dole 
will play some role. 

"Dole bad a role to play in this 
election." said Ledbetter "1 think 
he'll continue to push the campaign 
finance reform." 

This election saw a change in 
direction. There was less mudsling- 
ing and more money spenl on cam- 
paigning Perot's popularity, albeit 
decreasing, also raises another ques- 
tion: Is the voting population so fed 
up with the current government that 
a change from the outside is needed?

Winter bliss 



by Cas.sk Ritter 
Features Editor 

I am sure wc all need a Utile 
pick-me-up to gel us through Ibe 
gray November days upon us before 
we make ii to ibe bright beautiful 
snowy days of winter So I am writ- 
ing about some of the things tbat put 
a smile on my face during the winter 
months, in hopes of putting a smile 
on your face. 

It's interesting how every time 
you think you just can't stand anoth- 
er drab day of the current 
weather, it's time for 
the new season. Well 
that's exactly bow I 
was feeling, and 
then Ibis weekend 
happened. 

This weekend gave 
most of us the first taste 
of snow for the season. It was 
great! I was acting like some ram- 
bunctious little kid who ate loo 
much candy. It reminded me that it is 
time to shift gears into a seasonal 
spirit. A spirit some seem to lack. I 
say this because it seems every time 
I watch the news, some newscaster 
is complaining about the cold weath- 
er upon us. Whether they feel oblig- 
ated to do this because they think it 
is what most people want to hear, or 
whether they do it just because they 
don't like the winter weather, in 
which case I would find it hard to 
believe that that many people don't 
like winter. Whatever their reason. I 




wish they would stop 
Therefore. I feel it is my duly to 
engage in a more positive side of 
winter. 

For instance, I love the look of 
clean snow. Show me someone wbo 
doesn't. It's so innocent and beauti- 
ful looking that it always makes me 
feel more energized. Of course 
falling snow has a better effect than 
sitting snow. Who can resist getting 
into the "Holiday spirit" when it 
snows? 

Some of my wintertime favorites 
are: bundling up in warm lay- 
ers of clothes until I 
resemble the Michel in 
Man; listening to 
Christmas music 
which gives me 
barely 
resistible urge to hug 
everyone; admiring 
decorations; touring the beau- 
tifully decorated mall, or the down- 
town area, especially the huge Santa 
Claus on Main Street. 

Other favorites include; walking 
in the snow until my nose drips like 
a fountain and I feel like one big ice- 
cube. I still enjoy making angels in 
the snow, and I could go on and on 
about picking out a Christmas tree 
but I think I will save that until it is 
closer to Christmas Who could for- 
get all the great Christmas movies 
like, "A Christinas Story," "It's a 
Wonderful Life," Miracle on 34th 
Street" (the original) and "National 
Lampoon's Christmas Vacation." 



I love that most everyone comes 
borne for the holidays, that long- 
time friends are remembered with a 
card or a telephone call; switching 
over to 4-wheel drive; that you can 
always count on seeing ibe Salvation 
Army Santa Claus ringing his bell 
outside department stores. And wbo 
could forget one of students all-time 
favorite part of winter — Christmas 
vacation? Not I. 

Not to mention all of the winter 
sports like tobogganing at Pokagon, 
downhill skiing in nearby Michigan, 
cross-country skiing anywhere, sled- 
ding in Franke park and snowball 
fights. 

I long for the day where I wake 
up early with nothing on my "to do" 
list, only to arise to an outside that 
has been covered in a blanket of 
snow. Don't gel me wrong, I dread 
rolling out of my cozy warm bed to 
the cold, black winter morning, only 
to fight with my car for twenty min- 
utes, only to go to work or class, as 
much as the next person. 

However, this is what makes 
winter winter. Love it or leave it 

Maybe I'm preempting the win- 
ter season, but someone has to 
remind all of you whiners out there 
that some of us really do love this 
kind of weather. 

Even when I'm at the point — 
usually in late February — where I 
am sick and tired of the snow, I can 
always admire the beauty of it. I sug- 
gest you try and do the same. After 
all, change is good for the soul

Students' words, 
thoughts controlled 

Most papers arc not censored. If menl without newspapers or news- 



there is censorship, il is usually 
self-imposed by the writer or ihe 
ediior of the paper. 

Last Friday, The Journal Gazette 
ran a story concerning Elrnhursl's 
Tbe Advance. The Journal Gazette 
reported thai The Advance's advis- 
er pulled the first issue of the year 
because one of their columnists 
wrote a story which included a 
quote from Rolling — 

Stone wriier Hugh ^^^^^^™ 
Gallagher 

"MTV exists to 
remind me of bow 
much I'm not gel- 
ting laid," 
Gallagher wrote. 

The quote 
appeared in a col- 
umn called 
"Geoff's 
Contemplative 
Comer." Whether 
Elmhursi students 
or staff would be 
offended by this is 
not germane to this 
case. 

This case boils 
down to why there 
is censorship 
Censorship is an 
intrusion into our 
minds. The deci- 
sion by Melanie 
Myers, adviser lo 
The Advance, was 
made 10 preserve 
the paper's integri- 
ty 



papers without government. I 
should not hesitate a moment lo 
choose the latter," Jefferson wrote 
in 1787. 

Myers denied Elmhurst's liberty 
and may have killed any chance of 
free and open discussion Only one 
issue of the paper was censored 
The first issue. During the rest of 
the year, those students will live in 
— fear of writing 
something else 
judged too 
offensive by 
the Draconian 
Elmhursi 
power struc- 
ture. 

Myers 
has effectively 
silenced the 
words of all 
Elmhursi stu- 
dents. 

She may 
have feared a 
potential back- 
lash from par- 
ents who may 
have felt the 
quote was per- 
verse in some 
way. In today's 
climate, her 
possible fear is 
understand- 
able. 

Unfortunately, 
this will not be 



Throughout 

recorded 

history, the 

power 

structure has 

attempted to 

silence the 

media. 



the last time censorship will attack 
But censoring a paper erodes the today's writers. Newspapers and 
opportunity for an open discussion other media are under constant 



of the facts. We think Myers should 
have enough faith in the human 
need for debate 10 let tbe article 
stand on its own merits. 

Throughout recorded history, 
the power structure has attempted 
to silence the media Napoleon rec- 
ognized the power of the pen when 
he said. Tour bosiile newspapers 
are more to be feared than a thou- 
sand bayonets." 

Thomas Jefferson knew about 
the dangers of censorship and what 
a power structure capable of con- 
trolling the media could do 

"Were it left to me to decide 
whether we should have a govem- 



attack from the bard-right who bark 
"liberal media" at the counting of a 
poll. 

What those on the right fail (o 
realize is most journalists fall into 
tine with the rest of the country 
politically Where journalists usual- 
ly differ is on the First Amendment 

Without the current interpreta- 
tion of the First Amendment many 
journalists would be unable to do 
their jobs because of the fear of a 
libel suit 

"Our liberty depends on the 
freedom of tbe press, and that can- 
not be limited without being lost" 
said iefferson in 1786.

Evander Holyfield smoked it

was never given a chance lo beat 
Tyson, but he proved all the pundiis 
wrong in 11 rounds of boning mas- 
tery When Holyfield first won the 
belt from Larry Holmes, be wasn't 
given a chance then eilher 

Holyfield is a man who rises to 
the challenge His heart is greater 
than any heavyweight fighting 
today. Holyfield joined Muhammad 
Ali as the only three-time heavy- 
weight boxing champion of the 
world. 

The U.S. Army choked it when 



Smoked or choked 



several of their non-commissioned 

officers and commissioned officers 
were charged with rape and other 
sexual problems These people are 
given the responsibility of serving

subordinates were also part of this 
country and they have been violated. 
The NCO's have failed in their duty 
lo serve this country Bui they did 
succeed in satisfying their own per- 
verse sense of power Why don' t we 
institute flogging in the army again? 
Francis Albert Sinatra, a.k.a. The 
Chairman of the Board, smoked it 



when he was released from a Los 
Angeles hospital on Sunday. The 
world needs more crooners with ihe 
sex appeal of The Voice. Sinatra 
invented the word cool. 

The Purdue Boilermakers 
smoked ihe Michigan Wolverines 
when they squeaked out a victory in 
West Lafayette Coach Jim Colletto 
is a class act and deserved to win 
one against the Wolverine jugger- 
naut. 

Football legend and Republican 
Rep Steve Largent smoked it when

and recommended thai Newt 
Gingnch give up being Sneaker of 
the House during the investigation 
of Gingrich's ethics. It's about lime 
someone stood up and thought as a 
person instead of a well-trained 
automaton who repeals the parly 
rhetoric. 

Chancellor Wartell smoked it 
when at his 50th birthday party he 
asked everyone to donate to the 
IPFW Child Care Center instead of 
giving gifts for his birthday. We are 
glad Chancellor WarteL has put the 
Child Care Center on his priority

Homosexuality does

Contrary lo conventional wis- 
dom, there is another court case 
besides (be OJ. civil case. 

Because of my own ignorance, I 
do nol know the actual name of the 
case, but it does concern Jenny 
Jones and her show. 

The Jenny Jones case stems from 
a gucsl who was the object of a 
homosexual man's attraction 

The aiiractee killed the homo- 
sexual because of the "embarrass- 
ment" he fell after the show was 
taped He didn'l snow any repulsion 
toward the man who was attracied 
lo him during ihe taping, but after 
the show he murdered ihe bomosex- 

Now the murderer is in court. 
His lawyers say thai he was unstable 
and the embarrassment of the homo- 
sexual attraction put him over the 
edge. 

According to his lawyers, Jenny 
Jones and her show are ai fault 
because they perpetuated ibis poten- 
tial love affair. 

What if Ibis would have been a 
woman who was attracted to ibis 
murderer? Would anyone blame the 
show and tabloid television in gen- 
eral for the absurd killing? 

1 doubt it Women's groups from 



every comer of 
the country 
would have- 
been calling for 
this wretched 
man's head on 
a platter Now 
they are silent 
Everyone is 
silent, except 
tbe periodic 
condemnation 
of talk show 
television in 
general. 
This was a murder committed 
because one man could nol deal 
with the reality of another man who 
was aitracicd to him. 

How far are many of us hetero- 
sexual men from commuting that 
crime? From whal I have seen 
around this campus, it looks like a 
very short drive. 

For whal reason? We are so 
afraid that we may be gay thai we 
must eradicate all homosexuals jusl 
to prove we are straight 

Do some men see homosexuals 
as a threat to their "guyness?" 
Everyone has beard words to this 
effect that if a man protesls loo 
much about homosexuality he musi 
have some unresolved questions 
within him about his own sexuality 
or lack thereof. 

There may be some validity to 
that theory It would explain J 
Edgar Hoover and his scouring of 
ihe country to rid ihe U.S. of homo- 
sexuals and communists. All the 
while Hoover lived wiih a man who 
claimed to be his attache (nudge. 
nudge, wink, wink) 

Guess what I can do the math 
now . . . I jusl "aced" a math test 
go figure. 



Work vs. school 




e&gt;\ Ststo- 



difficulties of going to college and 
working full time. 

During the announcement a 
young man worried about tbe 
Caich-22 that faces many students 
in Fort Wayne and IPFW in partic- 
ular. 

The Catch-22 was that he need- 
ed a new job that would pay more 
money; however, to get a better 
job be needed to go to college, but 
if he tries to get an education he 
will have to cut his hours, there- 
fore making less money than 
before. Sound familiar? 

This situation aggravated me as 
I began lo realize how poorly the 
whole system is organized. For 
instance. I warn to go to college 
full lime in order lo gel my degree 
within a five year period. 

In order to afford each semes- 
ter's fees I am required lo work 
full time also. Furthermore. I do 
not want to go through college 
without getting involved in a few 
of Ihe organizations and/or events 
available on campus. 

It jusi seems that the people 
who try tbe hardest lo succeed gel 
the roughesi treatment 

I know several students who 
live with their parents and have no 
job who are awarded hundreds, if 



nol thousands, of dollars through 
financial aid. 

While there may be money for 
tuition, there is rarely money for 
anything else for those students 

Yet someone who works on 
iheir feet hour afier hour is lucky 
to receive a penny of financial aid 
and thai person still has no money 
left over after luition. 

"God helps those that help 
themselves." is a commonly 
repealed phrase. I feel the people 
who decide who gets what from 
financial aid are deaf lo that say- 
ing. 

This lack of financial aid leads 
to a lack of student involvement 
on campus. The fact lhal (bis is a 
commuter campus and that more 
than half the students attend class- 
es part time in order to afford it 
may possibly be the main reason. 

Is there a solution lo this prob- 
lem thai will assist every siudeni 
who needs the help? 

Society is continually encour- 
aging people lo further iheir edu- 
cation, yet many people find that 
the price is too high I realize that 
often tunes the money is simply 
not there. 

Yel shouldn't there be a source 
of aid available for the hardwork- , 
ing?

Volleydons wrap up conference 
tourney, league nemesis 



by S. Brant Kclley 
Sports Editor 

Tbc women's volleyball team fin- 
ished regular-season play last week- 
end at the Gates Center with a pair of 
Great Lakes Valley Conference wins, 
including a straight-game win over 
conference challenger Northern 
Kentucky University 

Friday night, the Volleydons 
doused Bellarmine College - scoring 



more points in each game than (he 
Lady Knights scored the entire 
match, 15-3. 15-6. 15-5. 

The Lady Knights, suffering 
injuries to three starters and dressing 
only seven players, were woefully 
undermanned despite their 19-14 
regular- season record. 

"We were expecting a lot more 
than they gave us," IPFW coach Tim 
Heffron said. "They played as well as 
(bey could under the circumstances 



We pretty much blew their doors 
off in the first game " 

The second game saw the 'Dons 
setde into a mid-match lapse and the 
Knights tied the score 6-6 midway 
though. Bui IPFW awoke from its 
slumber, reeled off the next nine 
points, and won the next game and

Women's basketball full of new faces 



by S. Brant Kclley 
Sports Editor 

For those who followed Coach 
Pam Bowden's Lady Mastodons 
last year, a hard look at (his year's 
roster will produce a nearly unrec- 
ognizable lineup with which to fol- 
low up last season's 23-5 club. 

IPFW lost superscorer Lindy 
Jones and Jennie Newhard to gradu- 
ation; Lhi-fi three would-be seniors 
decided to forego their final sea- 
sons, leaving Bowden with some 
big holes to fill. 

Jones. Great Lakes Valley 
Conference Player of the Year, top 
scorer in Division II and on every- 
one's All-Amencan team last year is 
gone So is Newhard. along with her 
6-foot frame and record-setting shot 
blocking aim. 

Nobody will step in for Jones 
directly, but Bowden said her offen- 
sive philosophy will be the same: 
push the tempo. Sophomore Jessica 
Henry will likely start at the off- 
guard position, but she may be 
pushed by newcomer Nicole 
Ruggles out of Michigan. Walk-on 
Susan Lowden from Carroll High 
School may also see some time 

"Hopefully, we'll have a lot bet- 
ter balance out of our scoring this 
year." Bowden said. "If we're bal- 
anced and we gel a little depth ou( 
of our bench, we'll be okay. 

"We're still having a litlle trou- 



ble adjusting as far as our transition 
game a litlle bil " 

Weaving (he different players 
together to form a coherent fabric 
will be as great a challenge for 
Bowden as replacing the ones gone. 

"It's a challenge to work with 
people you haven't worked wilh," 
junior forward Leah Sheets said. 

"Last year, we knew how each 
of us played." 

Wendy Recker, a record- setting 
assist leader during her sophomore 
year, will be replaced by Idaho State 
transfer Tara Beauchine and fresh- 
man Bemadetie Gleeson. 

Sheets is the rock upon which 
Bowden will build. Sheets will get 
help from ihe other reluming starter, 
senior forward Renae Roessler. But 
Bowden said she is counting on 
some of (he newcomers to con- 
tribute, also. 

"It isn't like one or two people," 
Bowden said. "I think the transfers 
coming in are giving some good 
leadership, and Renae is doing a 
good job" 

Bowden's players are anticipat- 
ing the changes. 

"1 think we'll play more as a 
team." Roessler said. "We'll move 
the ball around a lot more. 

"This year, we're going to run 
plays more often." 

To bolster Roessler's presence in 
the middle, Bowden is counting on 
Katrina Hoelting from Western 



Nebraska Community College and 
returning senior Sarah Smith. Six- 
fool- 1 wo freshmen Mandy Loveless 
and Shalon Sloane may also see sig- 
nificant time. 

While the new look of Lady 
Mastodon basketball will lack 26 
points per game at one position, 
Bowden hopes il will field more 
defense and rebounding. 

"I think we'll probably be a little 
bit better defensively." Bowden said 
of the Lady 'Dons "I see some 
things we're doing now (hat we're a 
little bil ahead defensively, so if we 
keep progressing. I (hink defense 
could be a stronger area for us than 
u was last year." 

The final analysis on (be team 
may come late in the season when 
the players have been together for a 
while. It's a big change from las( 
year's squad which returned every 
player from the season previous. 

So is tins team as good as ihe 
one from last year? 

"I don't know if (hat's a real fair 
question," Bowden said "We're so 
new and we've got a lot of inexperi- 
ence I don't think you can compare 
(he two teams. 

"We're playing a lot tougher 
schedule in the preseason. We could 
go 1-6, but does that mean we're noi 
as good a team as last year? Maybe 
and maybe not 

"It jusl depends on bow our kids 
come together." 



Soccer team ends season fast 



by S. Brant Kelky 
Sports Editor 

IPFW's soccer team ended its up- 
and-down season with a loss in (he 
first round of the Greal Lakes Valley 
Conference toumameni las( 
Wednesday night. 

In a last-minute change, the 
Masiodons were sent to the 
University ^ofWisconsin-Parkside as 
the seventh seed instead of to Lewis 
Univcrsily, dampening the pre-lour- 
namen( anticipation in coach Terry 
Stefankicwicz. 

Stefankiewicz had said earlier he 
wanted (o face Lewis, raiber than the 
Rangers, who were probably a better 
team. 

With the score tied 0-0 at half time, 
the Rangers used the advantageous 
wind and the Dons fatigue to score 
(wo goals in the second half, one in 
the final 30 seconds, (o win (he 
match and send IPFW home with a 
7-12 record in its season. 

"It was as even as even could be," 
Siefankicwicz said. "We had jusl as 
many good opportunities as they did. 

"Second half, they had the wind 
factor ... and they did slart to domi- 
naie." 

At around the 70th minute, an over- 
commiltcd defender allowed a 
Ranger goal. 

In other first-round GLVC matches. 
Lewis University bea( Bellarmine 4- 
0. Bellarmine was a surprise entry 
after a loss to the 'Dons two 
Saturdays ago: Southern Indiana 
University was turned down in its 
bid for the (oumamenu seeding both 
IPFW and (he Knights up by a spoL 



The University of Missouri-Si. 
Louis defeated Northern Kentucky 
Universily, 1-0 and Quincy 
University defeated Southern Illinois 
University- Ed wardsville, 1-0. 

According to Stefankiewicz. ihe 
'Dons are already looking forward (o 
next year. The departure of senior co- 
capOins Matt Schmitz, Ben Trevino

Volleyball. 

continued from page 5 

Saturday evening witnessed a 
more concentrated Volleydon squad 
lake conference nemesis NKU apart 
in three games, vividly establishing 
conference supremacy in prepara- 
tion for the conference tournament. 
which starts tonight at the Gates 
Center. 

"We'd been looking forward 
to that match for three months," 
Heffron said. 

"We expected to play well, we 
expected them to play welt, and 
they did play well." 

With a share of the conference 
title already wrapped up, IPFW's 
win over NKU solidified its hold of 
an NCAA Midwest Regional tour- 
nament birth. The Volleydons were 
tied with the Norse for fourth place 
in the regional. 

"Wc already won the confer- 
ence, so this weekend was basically 
reaffirming our position." Hcffron 
said. 

The Norse played IPFW close 
in the first two games before falter- 
ing in the third, and final, game to 
place the 'Dons alone at the top of 
the conference. 15-12-, 15-11.15-4. 

"The first two games were a 
dogfight." Heffron said. '"(But) 
physically, we were just too much 
for them " 

The most critical stretch came 
in the second game when Heffron 
used his final substitution with 
sophomore Doltie Porch still on the 
bench Reserve Star Trahin played 
in place of Porch - typically a game- 
high performer against the Norse - 
and filled her role well. 

The two wins gear the 'Dons 
for the conference tournament at 
the Gates Center this week. Top- 
seeded IPFW plays the University 
of Southern Indiana tonight at 7 
P-m., the final first-round game of 
the evening. 

Should tbey advance, the 
'Dons will play the winner of the 
match between the University of 
Missouri-Si. Louis and either 
Southern Illinois University- 
Edwardsville or Lewis University 
on Friday at 7 pm. 

The loumament final will be 
played on Saturday at 2 pm
