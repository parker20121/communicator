IPFW tuition costs continue to climb 



By S. Brant Kelky 
News Editor, and 

Ramona McGown, 
Managing Editor 

Tuition and fees ai IPFW have 
outpaced inflation for at least the 
last seven years, and students are 
rmding school more expensive now 
than ever before. 

Tuition for a student attending 
IPFW during the 1988-89 school 
year was S53 per credit hour. For 
the 1994-95 school year, il is 
S80.25 per credit hour. 

Over the seven-year period from 
the 1988-89 school year to the 
1994-95 school year, tuition has 
risen by S27.Z5 per credit hour, a 66 
percent increase. 

Marian Zinunerman, dean of stu- 
dents, said she thought all campuses 
tiad similar tuition and fee inaeases 
during the same seven-year period. 

Zimmerman said said almost 
anyone can pay for college because

Register Once 
petition 
requires 

3000 
signatures 

By Nol T. Beckley 
SlalT Writer 

On Nov. 7, IPSGA resolved to 
work toward and support the 
implementation of the National 
Voter Registration Act in Indiana. 

IPSGA also resolved to work 
with Register Once to expand stu- 
dent voter registration. 

The Register Once campaign 
will be at 350 universities to get 
petitions signed by the students. 

Jerry Richardson, chief justice 
of judicial affairs, said, "We need 
25 percent of the student body lu 
sign tbe petition." 

The vice president of legisla- 
tion. Amy Steenman, stated. "Onl&gt; 
three or four percent of the studcm 
body have signed the petition su 
far." 

Register Once goals are; 

• to allow students to register to 
vote while registering for classes; 

• to allow student access to absen- 
tee ballots and places to deposit 
them; 

• to install polling locations at 
every campus with more than 200 
resident students; and, 

■ to enact campus-ba.sed voting for 
all students, allowing the campus 
to operate as a courthouse does in 
many counties. 

Chris Douse, chairman of leg- 
islative affairs, said. "1 think it's 
great that they started this project 
at IPFNV, and I'm glad the senate 
has fully supponed them." 

Only two-fifths of registered 18 
to 24-year-olds voted in the last 
presidential election in 1992, 

Any students who would like to 
sign the petition should contact 
Amy Steenman or Jerry 
Richardson at the Student 
Govemmem oifices Walb Union. 



loans up to the total cost of educa- 
tion. 

The tuition increases arc a bur- 
den for students who pay for their 
own education. "People who don't 
qualify for financiat aid., are hurl 
the most," said 
Zimmerman. 

Zimmerman 
also said IPFW 
is still reasonahiy 
priced, when 
compared to pri- 
vate schools or 
to Indiana or 
Purdue 
University' s 

main campus. "I think we still offer 
a bargain education." she said. 

Liz Andrews, a senior who cur- 
rently attends IPFW, said the finan- 
cial aid office at Bloominglon is 
more official, more organized. 
"Responses to my questions were 
more definite, and the process was 
much quicker than here," Andrews 
said. 



Zimmerman said almost 
anyone can pay for col- 
lege because or the avail- 
ability of educational 
loans up (o the total cost 
of education. 



However, "The financial aid 
office is concerned about how stu- 
dents are serviced," said Gary 
Davis, mlcrim director of fmancial 
^d. 

itely 9000 IPFW stu- 
dents receive 
financial aid — 
roughly 78 per- 
cent of the stu- 
dent population.

Over the 1988-94 period, enroll- 
ment has decreased from a high of 
12,090 during the fall of 1992 to 
11,513 this semester. Dahl said 
smaller local high school graduat- 
ing classes were the reason for the 
decline in enrolhnent. 

He also said the next several 



high school graduating classes are 
larger, so he expects enrollment to 
increase in the near future. 

Zinunerman suggested students 
keep pressure on everyone, espe- 
cially the administration and the 
stale legislature, to explain how 
they are spending the university's 
money. She said il is the students' 
responsibility to keep track of 
where the money is going. 

Davis Slated that Joyce Hall, 
director of financial aid at Purdue 
University, will be acting as a con- 
sultant to the IPFW financial aid 
office. 

Hall will make recommendations 
for improvement of the IPFW 
fmancial aid system. 

Any student wishing to share 
concerns or questions about finan- 
cial aid are welcome to address 
them to Hall in an open forum on 
Nov. 28, 3 p.m. to 4 p.m- 

Notice of the location will be 
posted on the bulletin board outside 
the fmancial aid office.

IPSGA votes to fund 

Writing Center 

material costs 



by Nol T. Beckley 
Staff Writer 

The IPSGA approved a one- 
time donation to the writing center 
to cover the cost of handbooks, 
journal subscriptions and other 
books, 

IPSGA president, Mark King, 
said, "Mainly, it's material that we 
apparently do nol have on cam- 
pus." 

According to King, the donated 
money is already part of the 
IPSGA office expense fund, which 
does not include money in reserve 
for the student contingency fund.

Communicator reported the library 
staff also asked for money from 
iPSGA to fund an information 
index. 

The primary resistance to 
adding the index service was the 
feeling of IPFW Chancellor 
Michael Wanell dial "general fund 
money, not ... student fees" should 
pay for the database. 

Unlike the library, which could 
be used by the whole community, 
the Writing Center is solely used 
by IPFW students who seek the 
free services of the Center in order 
to improve their writing skills. 

Vice chancellor of Academic 
Affairs Fred Kirchhoff, sees no 
problem with IPSGA donating to 
the Writing Center, according to 
King, 

Jerry Richardson, chief justice 
of judicial affairs, commented on 
the Writing Center, "It's clearly a 
student service." 

Carol Roberts, writing center 
director, had a-sked King for four 
specific items: 

• Books — to enable writers to have 
an accessible library on different 
writing techniques; 

• Additional journals — to use as 
models, to offer a chance of publi- 
cation, and to incorporate all dif- 
ferent disciplines into the writing 
center, 

• Electronics — a computer to 
allow the center to keep up-to-date 
records and software that could be 
formatted to MLA or a related 
writing style; and, 

• Student wages — to pay a student 
to assist in setting up the database. 

Roberts added, "We hope to 
establish an on-line Writing Center 
and eventually have students sign 
up for meetmgs by conqmter ," 

King brought Roberts' request 
to the whole senate for discussion, 
with thoughts on the Center and 
the tutors, 

'The dedication to the Center is 
remarkable," Roberts said. 

"We want to help people 
become better writers," she added.

Quote of the week 

"When we take a retrospective 
view of the arts and sciences - 
the wise legislators - the 
Pyramids, and other 
magnificent buildings - the 
turning of the channel of the 
river Nile, by the sons of Africa 
or of Ham, among whom learn- 
ing originated, and was carried 
thence into Greece, where it was 
improved upon and refined. " 
- David Walker (1829) 



Staff Editorial 



Kone Electric bas spoken of no 
longer servicing "the dangerous 
parts of the inner cily" of Fort 
Wayne, even though it bas been 
reported (bat none of tbe 26 
alleged crimes thai led Kone lo 
consider withdrawing service from 
the inner city aciually took place 
(here. 

Now. as a siudenl at IPFW, one 
mlghr ask, "Why should I be con- 
cerned about the inner city?" The 
answer is simple. The inner city is 
no less a part of the city as a whole 
than the north side of Fort Wayne. 
The inner cily is a part of your city, 
and as a citizen, you are as respon- 
sible for what happens there as the 
residents of that area are; further- 
more, you are ultimately affected 
by Korte's discontinued service to 
the inner city. 

Because our city's alleged "dan- 
ger zone" is a predominantly 



African-American neighborhood, 
Korte's decision begs the question 
of whether racism is at work, is 
Korte merely using crime as a 
scapegoat for racist policies? 

By Korte's reasoning, all of 
New York city should refuse to 

// all of the companies 
decided to stop service to 
areas in the city because of 
crime, where would they offer 
serviceif Crime occurs every- 
where; it is not exclusive lo 
the African American 
community. 

service Middle Eastern people and 
those of Middle Eastern descent 
because a few Arabic Muslims 
blew up the World Trade Ccnicr. 

If all of the companies decided 
to stop service to areas in tbe city 
because of crime, where would 



they offer services? Crime occurs 
everywhere; it is not exclusive lo 
the African-American community. 

As a community, we seem to be 
slating thai if the media does not 
report crimes in particular areas of 
the city, then it is okay lo feel safe 
in tho.se places. But does anyone 
honestly believe that there is a safe 
place anywhere in today's society? 

Members of (he greater Fort 
Wayne community need to be part 
of building solutions lo problems 
that affect area residents— if not 
for the good of one's neighbor. 
then at least for the good of one's 
self. 

If the community as a body 
refuses to atiend to the injuries 
being done to Fori Wayne through 
Korte's threat to discontinue ser- 
vice to the inner city, then the com- 
munity may bear the responsibility 
of its own death.

God loves "gays" too 



To the editor. 



God does nol hale gays; he only 
hales what they arc doing, just 
like he hales when any person 
sins. God loves us all. He only 
wants us to realize what sin wc 
are doing and correci it. As long 
as wc arc trying, and even if we 
do nol try, he loves us all. We ait 
all sinners. We are asked lo 
rebuke ihe wrong sin, I'm a sin- 
ner, you're a sinner, and none of 



us has only one sin. All sins are 
wrong in God's eyes. No one per- 
son is greaier than ihc other in 

"We, as God's children, must 
help each other, even the 
"gay." I do not like this 
word, but I do not know 
what other word to use, 
except 'sinner. '" 

God's eyes. As God's children, wc 



arc lo love all, but rebuke wrong, 
or the person who wishes noi to 
accept their siii as a sin. Wc, as 
God's children, must help each 
other, even ihc "gay." I do nol 
like this word, bul I do nol know 
whal other word lo use, except 
"sinner." Remember, We Arc All 
Sinners!

Homosexual conduct is immoral 



To the editor. 

I think it was Adam and Eve, nol 
Adam and Steve, I have yet to see a 
little girl grow up lo be a man or a 
hole boy pee and nol sland, I don't 
know whai's wrong with America 
today. Why do we lei a minority 
stand in the way? I'm nol talking of 
color or race; jui^t ihose who get in 
your face (like homosexuals who 
think Iheir way is the best,) 

Homosexuals are not a race, a 



culture, a species, gender or a color. 
It is a choice they have made. Don't 
tell me your way's the best If you 
feel guilty, then confess. Trying lo 
build yourselves up that way. If 
they believe thai ihcy cannot 
change, they are believing non- 
sense. It's a choice! A choice can 
change. One's physical makeup is 
one faci Ihai tells you that you were 
not meant to like the same sex. Two 
women cannot have a child. 
Two men cannot have a child. You 



cannot have children! You can't 
reproduce. The human race would 
have died with Adam and Steve, 
Homosexuality is a wrong and 
immoral choice. You are human, 
but your ways of sexual conduct are 
wrong and cloud your judgment in 
other areas of your life and should 
not be accepted,

Students body president is 
offered advice on abortion 

To the editor, 

I guess my advice to Mr. Mark King is that if he does 

not want to have an abortion, he shouldn't have one. 

Thanks,

Commentary 

Hiding in the closet 

is not the solution 



By Paul Tupper 
Staff Writer 

College campuses are notorious 
for being the most hberal part of 
any state. IPFW should not be an 
exception. Yet. I keep hearing 
many people say how conservative 
Fort Wayne is and how uncomfort- 
able life is for homosexuals here. 
Of course, this is nol Los Angeles, 
but arc the citizens of the Fort real- 
ly so redneck that gays feel unwant- 
ed here? 1 don't think so. 

Many of you open and out 
homosexuals may not know whal 
you can do in this town, or on this 
campus. How many of you go to 
student activities with your pan- 
ners? And if you go, are you as 
open about your affection as the 
heterosexuals? Why not? 

Heterosexuals are not going to 
learn to get used to us if we do not 
let them see that we want equalily. 
Let them know that we want to be 
affectionate with our boyfriends 
and girlfriends, just like homosexu- 
al couples. I just hate having to 



watch Buffy and Chip hold hands 
and smooch during free jazz con- 
certs or casino parties, when I am 
not allowed to do the same. 

I am not saying thai 1 want all 
gays and lesbians to sian making 
out on the concrete benches in front 
of Helmke library. 1 just think thai 
if we hold hands with each other 
Take it from someone who has 
been bashed; it may hurt for a 
few days, but you get over it, 
and life moves on. Do not let 
the threat of someone possibly 
hurting you stifle your 

opportunity for a fitU and 
active social life. 
and give each other litUe good-bye 
peeks, as heterosexuals do. no one 
is really going lo caie. And if they 
do nol like it, lei them leave. It's 
your school, too. and you. Cindy. 
have as much right to tell the world 
that you love Buffy as Chip does. 

Are you afraid of violence? Do 
nol be. Proving that not all 
Republicans are bad. Mayor Paul 
Helmke nol only added sexual ori- 
entation to the list of hate crimes 



that are prosecuted, but be also 
harshened the punishment for tho.se 
offenders. Take it from someone 
who has been bashed; it may hurt 
for a few days, but you get over it, 
and life moves on. Do nol let the 
threat of someone possibly hurling 
you stifle your opponunity for a 
full and active social hfe. 

As for this city. Fori Wayne has 
many gay activities. Local spoa 
groups, from bowling to volleyball, 
have activities for homosexuals. 
Whal you cannot find, start your- 
self. Can't seem to locale the gay 
pottery baTaar? Then organize your 
own. Fort Wayne is very diverse; it 
just hides it. Many people probably 
have the same interest as you. bul 
cannot seem to fmd others willing 
to engage in their favorite activity. 
So advertise and set it up yourself: 
the rewards for doing so are 
tremendous. 

Bottom line is, do nol let society 
dictate your life. Whether it is dat- 
ing or activities, do it the way you 
want to, not tbe way the heterosex- 
uals would not mind us doing iL

whenever a African-American 
states that we should build up

tion of racism or separatism, 
then try and pick up Webster's

Q: Just how effective 
are condoms at 
preventing AIDS? 

A: Recent studies show 
that latex condoms, used 
correctly and consistently, 
do prevent the 
transmission of HIV, the 
virus that causes AIDS. 
They also prevent the 
transnnission of other STDs 
such as syphilis and 
gonorrhea. Animal 
membrane condoms 
should NOT be counted on 
to prevent STDs.

IPFW co-sponsored, 

off-campus speaker's hate, 

bigotry and paranoia exposed 



By JefTfininson 
Guest Writer 

Advertisements for a lecture 
thai Student Director of activi- 
ties Greg Callen persuaded (he 
student activity board to co- 
sponsor two years ago touted 
the speaker. Eusiace Mullins, 
as a "researcher." "author" and 
"historian." Callen and SAB's 
public relations on Mullins' 
behalf, however, didn't men- 
lion that Mullins is a notorious 
racist and Jew-hater, who 
mixes distorted history and 
paranoid fantasy in writings 
which promote his belief in a 
worldwide Jewish conspiracy 
to destroy while Christians. 

"The Secret Holocaust." a 
pamphlet written by Mullins 
which is published and distrib- 
uted by The Aryan Nations. 
provides some fascinating 
glimpses into the mind of an 
unrepentant fascist. In it, 
Mullins claims thai the Jewish 
Holocaust was a "myth" con- 
cocted by Jews to deflect pub- 
lic attention from the bombing 
of German and Japanese cities 
during World War II. which he 
deemed to be massacres con- 
ducted by armies under Jewish 
direction. 

Mullins discarded bother- 
some historical evidence to the 
contrary with passages like the 
following: "The problem the 
Jews faced was that there had 
been no holocausts of Jewish 
victims during World War II, 
nor were there any photographs 
of burned Jewish bodies. Not 
to worry— the Jews simply 
appropriated the photographs 
of the bodies of their German 
victims, which are exhibited 
today in gruesome "museums" 
in Germany as exhibits of dead 
Jews." 

Mullins also claimed that the 
Holocaust was invented by 
Jews to extort money, and to 
use as a weapon of propaganda 
"in the hands of the Jews in 
their drive for total world 
power." 

Within this pamphlet's 33 
pages (excluding the adden- 
dum by an Aryan Nations 
writer). Mullins accuses Jews 
of having planned the "aimihi- 
lalion of all non-Jewish soci- 
eties: controlling the "news 
media of the worid." "subvert- 
ing" governments throughout 
the world, desiring to kill and 
drink the blood of non-Jews, 
fomenting Communist terror- 
ism, organizing "World 
Revolutionary Movement 
Purification Squads" aimed at 
killing "priests, nuns, choir- 
boys and women and chil- 
dren," and many other nasty 
things. 

Mullins' bigoted paranoia 
becomes comical on page six. 
where he asserts that tie phrase 
"have a good day" is really a 
secret Jewish code meaning 
"We're looking forward to 
more massacres of the women 
and children of the goyim, or 
the gentile cattle." He follows 
this with a truly bizarre fantasy 
purveyed as fact: "Now that 
the Jews have attained such 
enormous economic and politi- 
cal power in the United States, 
they have instructed all of their 
gentile employees in the vast 
networks of retail grocery, drug 
and apparel stores which they 
own throughout the United 
Stales that they must grtet each 
customer by saying, "Have a 
gootLdftyv." This apparently 
friendly and supposedly mean- 
ingless salutation lets the Jew 
in the know be tipped off that 
he is in a siore owned by Jews, 
and that the owners are antici- 
patip g/lfaayj ng a good day" m 
ifie^flnMry more slaughters 
of the innocent and helpless 



gentile women and children." 

That passage exemplifies a 
common practice by right-wing 
conspiracy-knocks; mundane 
and innocuous aspects of life 
are seized upon, invested with 
sinister meaning, and subse- 
quently become constant 
reminders-pervasive 
"proofs" — of a grand conspir- 
acy's existence. One can only 



views like Mullins' be 
exposed, not only because he 
was inaccurately purveyed as 
academically legitimate by 
Callen and SAB. but because 
seeing Mullins" raw paranoia 
and bigotry may help others to 
recognize more carefully pack- 
aged and widespread forms of 
the same. Variants of Mullins' 
basic formula of bigoted scape- 



Mullins accuses Jews of 
having planned the '^annihilation 

of all non-Jewish societies: 
controlling the **news media of the 
world," "subverting"* governments 
throughout the world, desiring to 

kill and drink the blood of 

non-Jews, fomenting Communist 

terrorism, organizing 'World 

Revolutionary Movement 

Purification Squads" aimed at 

killing "priests, nuns, choirboys and 

women and children,'' and many 

other nasty things. 



dits like Patrick Buchanan are 
strikingly similar to Mullins', 
and Buchanan's, whose similar 
scapegoating appeals to irra- 
tional fear of various minorities 
in our society, are regularly 
broadcast on CNN's crossfire. 

As I have witnessed at 
IPFW, a strident fascist can be 
promoted with impunity by an 
IPFW administrator and the 
board he "advises" without 
meeting a vote of approval 
from the board's student mem- 
bers. Competing voices of plu- 
ralism and reason, on the other 
hand, have been subjected to a 
rigorous weeding-out process 
and the active repression by 
that same administrator, while 
his administrative superiors 
write commentaries for The 
Communicator extolling the 
virtues of fairness, pluralism 
and tolerance. 

Editor's note: This is the first 
column in a two-part series on insii- 
luiionalized racism 

Though Brunson claims IPFW 
Student Activities Director Greg 
Callen made the decision to spon- 
sor Mullins' 1992 lecture. Callen 
claims SAB voted to sponsor the 
lecture. 



imagine what effect such pas- 
sages have on Mullins' follow- 
ers. 

It conjures for me a vision of 
neo-nazis with bad hair- 
cuts, scrambling out of K- 
Marts and running for their 
lives back to their survivalist 
bunkers to nervously fondle 
automatic weaponry. All 
because the clerk who rang up 
their camouflage wash-and- 
wear told them to "have a nice 
day." 

Mullins' primary scapegoats 
in "The Secret Holocaust" are 
Jews, but his tract is part of the 
propaganda arsenal of one of 
the most comprehensively and 
virulently bigoted groups in the 
United States. Aryan Nations 
members are generally as hate- 
ful and inclined toward vio- 
lence against people of color, 
gays and lesbians, leftists and 
liberals as they are toward 
Jewish people. Mullins' pam- 
phlet hints at his broader big- 
otries in his selective portrayal 
of the mld-I9th century, slave- 
owning "Southern civilization 
of the United States": White 
immigrants had wrested from a 
hostile territory the means to 
create a gracious culture, one 
which the ruder and more 
unlettered sections of the new 
Republic could only gape at in 
admiration..." He goes on to 
describe the Union victory over 
the Confederacy as "operating 
solely on the totalitarian con- 
cepts of Godless 
Communism," with pilfering 
Jews ultimately pulling the 
strings of their Union puppets. 

I think it is important that 



goating and appeals to irra- 
tional fear through make- 
believe conspiracy-theories are 
employed exhaustively on 
right-wing radio stations like 
WGL and stridently conserva- 
tive newspapers like The 
News-Sentinel. The anti- 
Jewish sentiments of nationally 
pronunent politicians and pun

In search of... the perfect whipped topping 



Kara Whiting 
Features Ediror 

Okay boys and girls I have 
decided to do something a liliie 
out of ihe ordinary. I realized 
while venturing to my comet gro- 
cery store thai wiJi the holidays 
soon approaching us wouldn't it 
be nice (o know what the best 
whipped lopping you can put on 
your pumplcin pie is? Yes, I fig- 
ured you all were wondering. 
"Whal is Ihe best whipped lop- 
ping?" So I have taken it upon 
myself to supply all of you with 
the answer. 

Everyone spends these next 
few weeks running around buying 
presents, baking, cooking, etc.. 
but no one ever considers whal 
may make Ihe whole family 
happy. For me. I would like to 
have the best of everything, so 
this year I wanl the best possible 
whipped topping for my pumpkin 
pie. 

I first of all must establish what 
exactly would constitute a deli- 
ciously perfect whipped lopping 
for all of my holiday needs. The 
whipped topping must be light 
and fluffy; it must have a good 
spreadable lejtiure; it must also be 
reasonably priced; and finally it 
must not be rich or heavy tasting, 
but rather it must have a sweet, 
flavorful taste. 

This week's rating system will 
be based on licks. One tick is not 
exactly whal one would consider 
a whipped lopping at all. Two 



licks are okay, but there is some- 
thing missing. Three licks are 
great, but it sUll could have been 
better. And four licks are belter 
than anything on this earth. 

•COOL WHIP 

My first victim of this scruti- 
nizing testing was Ihe infamous 
Cool Whip. Now I am sure that 
most of us have .seen the commer- 
cials for Cool Whip and so we can 
all relate to Ihe Jingle "Cool 
Whip's the one, . ," Well, my 
friends. 1 am sony to be the one lo 
say it. but ihe advertisers are 
wrong. Cool Whip is not ihe one. 
After the first lick I could not go 
back for more because it was 
heavy and had an oily aftertaste. 



The taste itself was kind of sweet. 
yet ihere was something missing. 
And ai the cost of SI. 19 for an 
eight-ounce lub, Cool Whip is 
wonh only one lick. 

•FLAVORITE 

Knowing that this whipped 
topping was the cheapesi. selling 
for S.89 for an eight-ounce tub, 1 
had my doubis about how well 
this whipped topping may lasie. 
But to my surprise this whipped 
topping turned out to be amazing. 
The way the sweetness touches 
your tongue, it just melts in your 
mouth. The texture itself was light 
and fluffy and could easily be 
spread onto anything this holiday 
season, especially pumpkin pie. I 



gave this whipped topping all four 
licks because it was divine. I seri- 
ously advise you lo try this lop- 
ping for all of your holiday needs. 

•REAL CREAM 

This can be found in the dairy 
section at the grocery for SI. 89 a 
can. It is a can much like the 
Reddi Wip we are all loo familiar 
with. Bui this particular kind of 
whipped lopping was the only one 
that was made with real cream. 
And after the first taste, 1 certainly 
could taste the cream or some- 
thing. The lopping was light, but 
very bland. It definitely lacked 
sweetness and had an awful oily 
afiertastc. And the worst pari was 
that it stuck to my tongue, a 



M 




Flavorite, (far right) was by far the hesf in this weelcs taste-test,

Casino Night 
sparks light interest 



Paul IVipper 
SlafT writer 

I Imagine, walking into. lh|^' bail- 
room of Walb and being handed 
S 10,000 lo gamble mi card games. 
O.K., so the money wasn't real, 
but the fun to be had was. For 
zero cash, you could divulge in a 
belting frenzy and lose mounds of 
cash without feeling bad about it. 
But what if gambling wasn't 
enough for you and you wanted lo 
bet on horse races? If you attend- 
ed SAB's free Casino Night, you 
were able lo do all of this and 
more. 

In addition lo card games and a 
horse race, there was a bona fide 
slighl-of-hand card sharic (I never 
did find my watch) who enter- 
tained the crowd. Wilh S5000 of 
your winnings, you could buy raf- 
fle tickets lo win prizes such as a 
television, CD player or camera. 

Robert Wilson, freshman, did 
not know that SAB had planned 
such a great pany. but had a blast 
after his dale brought him. Even 
though Wilson lefl without a prize 
from Ibe raffle, he says he would 
go again. "I had such a great time 
thai I am going to try to go to 
more things thai SAB puts on," 
says Wilson. 

Despite such fun, free enter- 
taitiment happening on campus, 
only approximately 100 of 12.000 
sludenls attended casino night. 
Elaine Linder, vice president of 
student government who is in 
charge of student activities, thinks 
that maybe a reason people don'i 
go to SAB events is lack of 
knowledge. Megan McArdle, a 
member of SAB, agrees wilh 
Linder. "People don't know what 
to expect," said McArdle. Boih 
said thai everyone who went had 
a good time. 



Linder says that many students 
have other prioriiies: work, siud- . 
ies and families make.iL'inipp^if | 
ble lo go lo student activities. 
Hoping to integrate the two. SAB 
will be hosting Breakfast wilh 
Santa, an event that will bring in 
students with children. 

Some people, but not many, 
told Linder thai ihey were not 
going to Casino Night because 
they do not support gambling. 

Many sludenls may not have 
known about Casino Night 
because the event was minimally 
advertised. 

Linder, however, has tried to 
advertise such events wilh flyers, 
posters and occasional ads in The 
Communicator. 

Greg Callen, director of stu- 
dent activities, said that there are 
about three activities a week 
planned for the students.

licks. 

•REDDI WIP 

The fourth and final victim of 
the lasle-iest this week was the 
infamous Reddi Wip. With a retail 
value of SI. 47 a can, you can 
enjoy a flavorful whipped lopping 
for any occasion. 1 personally 
liked the whipped lopping for its 



cherry-like tasie, bul ii was very 
oily, thick and heavy. The lasle 
itself was nussing sonuthing. but 
the pleasant cherry twisi made up 
for it. 

So. in conclusion, 1 have found 
that Ravoriie brand whipped top- 
ping is the best you can buy to 
help wilh the holiday season Ihai 
is fast approaching us. So for only 
S.89 a lub. go out and try it for 
yourself!
