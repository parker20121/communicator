monly asked in interviews. 

According to Coordinator of 
Employment Services Kari Marcotte. the 
number one complaint that she hears 
from employers with respect to inter- 
views, Is that the applicant does not dis- 
play enough enthusiasm for the organl- 

•Employers want applicants to 
understand the organization and its val- 
ues, so it may be necessary for the appli- 
cant to do some research about the com- 



pany." said Marcotte. "It's also Impor- 
tant Tor the applicant to let the cmplo; - 
er know there's interest." 

The workshop session will discuss 
the types of interviews students are like- 
ly to be invoked in and help them to 
know what to expect. "We'll also discuss 
the preparation for the Interview and 
talk about appropriate dress and how to 
research an organization," Marcotte 

Also featured is a preparation exer- 
cise which will involve walking the stu- 
dents through an interview and engag- 
ing them in the thought process associ- 
ated with interviewing for a position. 

A portion of the workshop will be a 
discussion about what employers look 
for in foture employees. "We'll talk 
about marketable attributes and help 
the students to reel more comfortable 
discussing their strengths and what the; 
have to offer." said Marcotte.

workshop, call the office of Academic 
Counseling and Career Services and

Self -appreciation 

' by Adam Taylor, Editor 



As a kid, I had a problem taking things 
for granted, I always took for granted that. 
school would be easy, that friends would be 
easy to make and that it would be easy to 
keep everyone happv all the time. I know I 
had this problem and I knew [nil well thai it 
was something that I would need to work 
out of me somedav because, despite some- 
times straying from the path Irom time to 
time, I do strive to be a good person. 

Unfortunate!}, this problem wasn't 
remedied when I was a teenager. In fact, I 
became even less thankful for what I had. I 
began to Tocus more on what I didn't have, 
instead of what I had alreadv . ] understand

This person responded by saving thai 
his birlhdav was actually a few days later 
: and that if his birthday was actually on the 
fifteenth, then Dr. King would have "had a 
run for his money." In other words, this per- 
son felt people should have been celebrating 
his birthday instead of Dr. King's. 

The person was laughing and thought 
the "joke" to be quite clever. I interpret this 
to be a total lack of respect lor Dr. King, his 
achievements and his goals. That same dav , 
I had yet another encounter with people 
who were my age who said lhat thev did nol 
need to celebrate his birthday because thev 
were not black. Ihis, loo, was said to me in 
a Joking manner. 

1 don't believe that Dr. King is someone 
who should be belittled and joked about. 
1 hesc people were very open, un.ivhamed

ihink a start would be in eliminating the

think about what ihe |okes mean and why 
Ihey are hurtful to that particular group. 

As a society, we could also take some 
time to try lo get to know people. One per- 
son at the conference mentioned that she 
realized she did not even know the names ol 
her neighbors of six months. All it took for 
her to establish a simple relationship was a 
quick introduction, a fricndlv hello and a

Sometimes I make good calls,

thing is, those people weren't the people I 
saw even day at school. They were the peo- 
ple that 1 volunteered at the hospital with, 
ihe parents ol the kids I coached in soccer 
and of course, my famil) . 1 had a few friends 
back then, but respect wasn't much of any- 
thing between them and me. Everyone 
(Including myself) was seeking respect from 
ihe masses and nol the few. 

After moving to Kentucky for a few 
months following mv graduation, 1 soon 
learned how little the voice of the many 
mattered in terms of who I was. I may have 
only had a few friends in high school, but in 
Kenturkv , I didn't have any. Soon, all I had

Pretty soon, all of u 
again (with exception to 
Iv completed the groupj and things were 
nearly back to normal. I also met a few other 
people, one of whom is sllll one of my best 
friends, and I thought mv social life was sei 
in concrete. I was hanging out with my girl- 
friend and her brother, as well as some of 
their friends, I would hang out with people 
from mv honors class at school, too, though 
we didn't do a whole lot. There was also, of 
course, mv besi friend Heidi, who I did 
spend a lot of time with. The spring of 19% 
was one of the best limes of mv life. 1 just 
wished it lasted longer than it did. 

First, mv best friend Heidi moved back 
to l-ort Lauderdale for the summer. Then I 
found mv grades Tor the semester were 
absolutel) horrible. Next my girlfriend 
hrokeop with me. To make things worse, we 
would fight every time we were around each 
other, keeping me awav from ihe rest of the 
people I was hanging out with. Mv school 
friends moved awav, so what relationships I 
had with them were gone. Just as soon as I 
had found a situation I liked, it was taken 
awav from me in a swill twist ol fate. 
Consequent!;, that August I found myself 
back in Indiana with no friends, an angn 
famllv and a GPA too low to get into an.v 
school lhat semester. 

There were a lot of other things thai 
occurred during my stint in Kentucky that 
left me e.xtrcmelv angry, but I managed to 
put it all behind me. I began hanging out 
with some different people who Hound I 
had a lot more in common with than some 
of my old friends. I got into IPFW in the 
spring of 1997 and I've been here ever 
since. If not for my family and friends, 
though, It never would Ve happened. I never 
would've tried college again. 

A few years later, I'm a lot older than I 
used lo be, I've come to appreciate a loi of 
things ever since that fateful Sunday I head- 
ed hack north. A lot or these things are just 
piddlv ihiiigv. like geiting enough sleep the 
night before and having a good dream or 
something like that. Some of Ihe things arc 
bigger, like being able to appreciate how 
great someone is and forgive them for what- 
ever problems have occurred between them 
and me. Maybe I'm just glad things have 
gotten better for me and I'm channeling 
that into everything else. I don't know. 

What I do know, ihough. is that people- 
should be thankful for the good things in 
their lives and spend less time worrying 
about the bad. The had is going to be there 

ray, so why not enjoj what part of life 

can? We're not kids any more: we can 
control our lives. All we have to do is want

Professor gives storytelling 
tips at Borders 



by Malissa F 
Staff Wriler 



On Saturday , January 15. 
Nancy B. Coihern, associate 
professor of education at 
IITW, presented her lecture 
on "The Value of Famih 
Storytelling." 

Cothern addressed (he 
group that had assembled at 
Borders Bookstore to discuss a 
stud) (ha( she helped conduct 
from 1992-94 with a class of 
fourth graders from Louisiana. 
She informed the audience 
that (he s(ud) took place to 
see if family storytelling 
would make a difference in 
the student's lives. 

Cothern explained (hat 
the study started out by hav- 
ing the parents volunteer 

ihare their personal child- 
hood stories. The s(udy pro- 
ided a professional story- 
teller to come in and guide the 
parents along. According to 
Cothern. some of the parents 
were hesitant at first, but they 
;oon became comfortable 

itudents. "Near the end of the 
school year, the) had older 
siblings and grandparents 
coming in and sharing their 
.vrj stories." said Cothern. 

Cothern explained (hat 
le fourth grade students 
began to realize (hat the faml- 
ig told to them 



pen tu them in their ever) "day 
Uses and that these were peo- 
ple just like (hem. "The.e stu- 
dents were more accepting ol 
■' Cothern, 



-The} ■ 






illing to share 

Eventually, students had 
to bring in their own personal 
stories once a week and com- 
pile them into a journal. Some 
of these stories would also be 
shared to the class. "These are 
not traditional stories (hat fol- 
low a story format," said 
Cothern. "These stories are a 
slice of life." 

The students were given 
topics that they 



able it

The Scoop on Breast Cancer 



;l Writer 



Breast cancer ran he a devastating 
illness for thousands or Families each 
)ear. According to the American Cancer 
Societ), approximately 175,000 ncu 
cases of breast cancer were e\pccted to 
occur among women in (he United States 
during 1999. Although rates arc highest 
in women, breast cancer can also occur 
in men. One can decrease the probabili- 
ty of (jetting breast cancer by knowing 
risk factors, pretention methods and 
lablc For guidance in one's 



a variety of options dependent upon (he 
progression, rjpe and stage of cancer. 
Treatment ma)' include lumpeclom), 
mas tec torn), radiation, chemotherap) 

tion of these treatments. Treatment 
options should be thorough!) discussed 
between the patient and the physician to 
ensure the best possible outcome. 
Research regarding breast 



Ig. Tun 






The risk of breast car 
with age; statistics show- a 20 fold 
increase from age -10 to age 95. The risk 
also increases in women who have a fam- 
il) history of breast cancer. The 
American Cancer Society Identifies the 
following as additional Factors For breast 
cancer: early menarche (onset of month- 
ly periods), late menopause, recent use 
of oral contraceptives or post- 
menopausal estrogen, never giving birth 
or giving birth at a later age and diets 
high in fat. 

Early detection oF breast cancer is 
still the best defense. Current recom- 
mendations from the American Cancer 
Societ) for women -10 and above are a 
yearly mammogram and a breast e\am 
by a healthcare professional. For women 
under JO, an e\am by a healthcare pro- 
fessional is recommended every three 
years. It is still recommended that all 
women, regardless oF age, should per- 
form monthly breast self exams. 

Breast cancer diagnostics can 
include mammography, ultrasound, 
biopsy and genetic testing. It is impor- 
tant to keep in mind that not all lumps 
are malignant. However, when a lump is 
discovered, one should seek medical 
i for diagnostic evaluation. 

Breast cancer treatment can include 



ventive and treatment options ai 
use oT tamoxifen or raloxifene for estro- 
gen receptor-positive breast tumors. 
Both are forms of hormonal therapi . 
which work by depriving the malignant 
cells of the estrogen needed for cell 
growth. Tamoxifen, used for over 10 
years to treat women with advanced 
breast cancer, is now prescribed to pre- 
vent recurrences among ivomcn with 
ear!) breast cancer. 

Research done by the National 
Cancer Institute showed that tamoxifen 
reduced breast cancer by 50% in women 
who had a greater risk due to age or 
other combinations of risk factors. 
Tamoxifen can fight breast cancer, pro- 
tect against osteoporosis, lower choles- 
terol and lower the risk of heart disease. 
However, it can cause hot flashes, vagi- 
nal discharge and overgrowth of the 
uterine lining, which can lead to uterine 
cancer as demonstrated bv research 
done at John Hopkins University'. 
Because of its different mode of action, 
raloxifene does not cause uterine com- 
plications and. therefore, ma) be a bet- 
ter alternative for those women who

All socio-economic levels susceptible; 
Bacterial STDs easy to treat if caught early 



by Michele Kadenko-Moniri, 



(STDs) arc on the rise and anyone 
can contract them According to 
the Kaiser Fa mi I) Foundation, at 
least one in three Americans will 
contract an STD in his or her lilc- 
limo. The Foundation states (hat 
15.3 million new infections affect' 
ing all socioeconomic levels are 
identified ever) )car. Lxperls agree 
that actual STB numbers are prob- 
abl) higher due to lack of sjmp- 
toms or refusal to get treatment. 
Two thirds or all new cases are 
human papilloma virus or tri- 
chomoniasis. The age groups at 
highest risk are teens and young 

Bacterial infections arc the 
easiest to treat and, iTcaught carl), 
are curable before permanent dam- 
age occurs. The bacterial infection 
gonorrhea can appear as early as 
two to ten days after exposure. 
Early symptoms are often mild for 
women and may include pain or 
burning with urination and/or yel- 
low or bloodv discharge. On the 
other hand, men usually complain 
of burning during urination and 
discharge from the penis. 
Symptoms of rectal infection 
include discharge, anal itching and 
sometimes-painful bowel move- 
ments. Resistant penicillin strains 
of gonorrhea with a diagnosis of 
other STDs are rommon. 
Chlamydia, another bacterial infec- 
tion, presents vaginal bleeding. 
unusual discharge and/or abdomi- 
nal pain that appears one io three

report a lack of symptoms. A com- 



mon long term effect of untreated 
chlamydia or gonorrhea is pelvic

nancies and chronic pelvic pain. 

According to Marlene Allison. 
R.N., of the Fort Wayne Board of 
Health, "Indianapolis has the high- 
est number of syphilis cases per

treatment when they first become 
infected. The course of the di

Man with the Mike: Power of the press not pleasant for Panther pessimist 

Bad quotes lead to ridiculing of Kentucky Wesleyan coach and star player. Good to see you're not bitter. 

by Brian Miller, 
Sports Editor 



sp 



The women's basketball 
team handed conference foe 
Kentuck) Weslejan an embar- 
rassing 76-55 loss last 
Saiurda; and g-.ise ihcm (heir 
first blemish on their confer- 
■ ence record. IPFW did a Rood 
job of CXOCUlEng, sumcjlhinj; 
Head Coach Karl Smesko has 
been pleased with as of late, 
and shot it'cll from heiiind (he 
arc hitiinu, on 13 of 22 trifcr- 
tas. Wcslevan's coach. Scott 
Lewis, a master of the obvious, 
said, "IPFW plajcd hard. They 
wanted the game more, and 
the; shot like they usually do." 

I ask you, at a collegiate 

. level, is It not your Job as an 
athlete to play hard? Isn't that 
why the school is giving you 
monej to compete at an 
intense Ievcl7 Thai's like com- 
plimenting the team for having 
their shoes tied. There are just 
some things you're supposed 
to do and playing hard is one 
of them! What does the phrase, 
"they wanted the game more" 



win? Of course they wanted 
win. Although this Is a verj 
-' group of girls, it does- 






All' 



Then Coach lewis 
said. "The; shot like the) usu- 
all; do." Did you expect them 

Blindfolded? Behind the back? 
Come on. How did you expect 
them to shoot? Are you talking 
percentages? Because if )ou 
are, the Dons actually shot 
worse f.lbl) than their season 
average (.383). 

Lewis proceeded to say 
this abuut his club, "We didn't 
do an] thing right. We got out- 
played. We didn't do what we 
should 1 vc offensively or defen- 
sive!)." I don't claim to be an 
educator of the game of bas- 
ketball, but are not offense and 
defense essentially the two 
main parts of it? Doesn't sound 
like a championship team, 
does it? You ma) wonder why I 
ask that. It's more for 
Kentucky Wesleyan. Panther 
fans need not worry because, 
according to your shooting 
guard and team leader Rae 
Keith, all that needs to happen 



consistent. 

"We're not consistent yet. 
When we start playing ever) 
night, we can be the champi- 
onship team we know we can 
be." said Keith. 

What? Arc you kidding 
me? lite championship team 
we know we can be? Give me a 
break. The team allowed the 
Dons to shoot 13 of &gt;I from 
the 3-poinl line while onls 
scoring 55 points in the whole 
game and )Ou're a night away 
from being a championship 
team! You have to be kidding 



I don't know why." Maybe sou 
were just defeated bj a better 
team! Not according to sharp- 
shooting Keith, who was 4-14 
from the field. She had a much 
better theory on the loss. As a 
matter of fact. 1 think she has it 
all figured out. I think there is 
a lot to learn from her, so all 
) ou philosophy major 



pla) better against the better 
teams. We need to get the ese 
of the tiger every night. " 

What? Let's go back and 
examine (he last t\so sentences, 
first, Keith said. The teams we 
should beat, we don't beat 
because we don't execute." Oh, 
oka; 1 got it. Well, let's just not 
worry about pl.ijing us, or 
I'arkside or Quincj or St. 
Joseph's. As a matter of fact, 
sou guys are tied for first so 
why don't ;ou just go ahead 
and plaj Northern ken lucks 
for the GI.VC Championship. I 
don't even knosi whs wc play 
the games. 

Then Keith said, "We need 
in get Ihe ei o of the tiger evers 
night." You sure this isn't 
Rock; Balboa we're dealing 
with? I think that is the worst 
line I have ever heard, "We 
need to get the e; c of the tiger
