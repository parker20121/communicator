Healthcare reform bill 



By Krlstan Mensch 



The health core reform bill thai many people 
throughout America hove bcon trying to wrap their 
heads around was passed hy tin- U.S. House of 
Representatives March 21 and signed into law by 
President Uarackobaina, 

As stmod In mi MSNBC article dated March 22, 
"On (he cusp of succeeding Where numerous past 
COuglQSaCB and administrations have failed, jubilant 
House Democrats voted 2 19-2 12 late Sunday to send 
legislation to President Uarack Ohnrmi. Republicans 
wore unanimous In opposition, joined by 34 dissident 

Democrats." 

Though the hill has been constantly debated since 
ii lirst begun to be a possibility, many Americans still 
do not know oven hairofwhul the bill consists of. 

"CoBtfl will come down for families, and 
businesses, and the federal government, reducing 
our deficit by more than SI trillion over the next two 
decades, Thai's what the reform is going to do," said 
President Obama, In a speech released by the Press 
Secretary March 25. 

Myths have been Hying around all over the place 
about the health care reform. Two of those have been 
that people will not be able to keep their private 
insurance and that the government will decide which 
doctor an individual will go to. 

On the contrary. President Obama said about 
die health insurance reform at the Department of 
the Interior, "If you like your current insurance, you 
will keep your current insurance. No government 
takeover; nobody is changing what you've got if 
you're happy with it. If you like your doctor, you will 
he able to keep your doctor. In fact, more people 
will keep their doctors because your coverage will 
be mine secure and more stable titan it was before 1 
signed this legislation." 



Uninsured people have to carry large burdens. To 
those people, whitebousc.gov said "for the first time 
io history, insurance companies will no longer be 
allowed to simply tell you 'no."' 

Further, whitehouse.gov explained that coverage 
will have to be offered regardless of health - meaning 
children with pre-existing conditions will not be 
allowed to be denied and uninsured adults with 
preexisting conditions will have access to a high- 
risk pool. Afterward, when the insurance exchange 
marketplace is running, no one will be up for denial 
based on their health status. In addition, rates will 
not be able to spike and insurance companies will 
not be able to drop people from their coverage when 
they are in need. 

Also a reform that is suppose to begin in 2010 is 
that coverage for people under their parents' plan, if 
their parents choose, will be able to last until they are 
26 years old. Therefore, many people living with their 
parents in their twenties will be able to be covered 
instead of going out and having to find their own 
insurance plan when they may not be financially 
able to do so. Though, it is unclear whether or not 
students who have already passed dependant age 
will be brought back on to their parents' health care 
or not. 

In addition, "Along with healthcare legislation, the 
House approved a bill Sunday night that will remove 
private banks as intermediaries in the federal student 
loan process," according to a March 22 article from 
The Michigan Daily, further explaining that the loans 
would be taken from the financial aid offices, and 
that the money saved because of no fees to banks' 
Pell grants will be increased. 

The bill, which is secminglyamile-longdocument, 
has many other facts and figures that are important 
for Americans to learn about. Because of this, Obama 
keeps referring back to encouraging Americans 
to view the document themselves throughout his 
speeches. The bill can be viewed at whitchouse.gov. 



"No Burmese 

Allowed" 

Ricker's Laundry Sign Causes 
Controversy in Fort Wayne Area

"For sanitary reasons, there are no Burmese 
people allowed," at least that's what the sign 
said. 

The sign was posted at Ricker's Laundry in 
Fort Wayne. Public protest and media response 
brought the sign down quickly. The employee 
who posted it was reprimanded and the owner 
publicly apologized to die Burmese community. 

The people of Burma face challenges no mat- 
ter where they go. m their homeland, the Junta 
has been accused of forcing people into slavery, 
destroying crops, and raising taxes to support a 
military state while limiting the availability of 
food and healthcare. When they flee to neigh- 
boring Thailand, their situation improves only 
slightly. Thailand has accepted the Burmese 
into refugee camps, but it's overcrowded and 
resources are scarce. The US provides home for 
some; as many as 6000 have setded in the Fort 
Wayne area. Life isn't easy here either. 

With little more than a 3 day orientation on 
life in America, many of the refugees speak no 
English. They are shown how to apply for pub- 
lic assistance, placed in housing, and given 
employment opportunities, but learning lo- 
cal social mores takes much longer. The lack of 
understanding American culture and common 
social graces is what led to the Ricker's em- 
ployee posting the sign in the first place. Some 
Burmese chew Betel-Nut and spit the red juice, 
which leaves stains, much like American men 
chew tobacco. New signs, in Burmese, posted 
throughout the store say "No Betel-nut" and 
"No Spitting." 

Minn Myint Nan Tin, director of the Com- 
munity Resource Center for Refugees, said in 
a phone interview that her agency is working 
with local social service providers to increase 
cultural awareness. A primary program would 
involve Awareness Training |to let the) Ameri- 
can community know who we are and why we're 
here." she said. They are also planning to teach 
the Burmese community some social "dos and 
don'ts."

The Big Heart Goal 

"Volunteering in the Fort Wayne Community" 



By Corlnne Johnson 



"I don'l even read them," Dan 
Sherwood, IPFW junior, said. "I think 
prelly much anyone can do thai... 
it goes along wflh the Freedom or 
Speech acl." lie's right, according to 
an IPFW statement. "Each individual 
may possess dllTerent ideas, as well as 
different ways of communicating those 
Ideas, parlicularly In a community as 
varied and diverse as a university." 

"They pui a lot of work into that," 
Zachary Preuss, a lirsl year student 
commenled on the sidewalk writing, 
"...mosdy they |usl hand out flyers." 
Throughout the campus, there arc 
messages posted In every doorway, 
along every hall and in every lounge. 

"I kind of Ignore that stuff," student 
Patty Colgate admitted. Another 
student added that it always seems 
"overcrowded," One window had 
a posting for Port Wayne Rescue 
Mission, IPFW Health Fair, Kyrou 
tailoring, CompUS Ministry, Charity 
Hike Hide, Collision documentary, as 
well as campaign posters for student 
government candidates, That's just one 
window. lis nut surprising thai many 
students do not pay attention to them. 

Some do pay attention, and lliink 
thai "one religious perspective Is 
overrepresented on this campus," one 
sophomore student said. "Too much 1 
I ovo Jesus crap posted all over the walls," 
she said, asking to be kept anonymous. 
According to the university's official 



policy "...the university seeks to 
develop and nurture diversity." 

"IPFW is nurturing, but cautious," 
Preuss said. "Some events may not be 
advertised very well." He suggested 
that groups whose beliefs are not pan 
of the main-stream are less likely to be 
seen advertising on the hallway walls. 
This may be true, but most students 
don't believe that It has anything to do 
with IPFW policy, 

"Indiana Is an Industrial, less 
educated, more traditional state," one 
student claimed. "The majority of Fort 
Wayne is from the working class. This is 
a common source for strongly religious 
roots, bclicFs and mindsets." 

"I love Jesus" might be 
overrepresented compared to other 
messages on campus, but it is not 
overrepresented compared to the 
number of "In God We Trust" license 
plates In the parking lot. 

IPFW policy says "[It] is committed 
to maintaining a community that 
recognizes and values the inherent 
worth and dignity of every person." 
Bringing together a variety of people 
on campus brings together a variety of 
beliefs and Ideas. A lull bulletin board is 
a good sign of open discussion, which 
the school says it wants to promote. 
The ideas presented should represent 
the people of the community, Colgate 
sums It up well, "We're a college, 
everybody has to realize that we are 
different people and have different 
opinions." The window may be 
crowded, but they'll make room for 
yours.

Matthew Bokhart, a senior Biology

order to help the disadvantaged in our

"The main reason we are here is

"I did a lot of work with Catholic opportunities and I hooked up &lt;

Bokhart, along with his roommate,

The pair hopes 
that by the end

So by all means spend time with people you 
think there might be romantic potential with, and 
definitely be yourself. What we want to do is help you 
do both by tearing away the barriers created by the 
language of "dating" promoted by our culture's dating 
literacy. By doing so, we also hope that people will 
stop beating themselves up for the things they can't 
control, such as when, where and how they will make 
a connection with someone that has the potential to 
grow into something more. 

Do you think the use of the terms "boyfriend" 
and "girlfriend" at such a fundamental relationship 
level provides a matrix for Immature adult 
relationships? -Dean, Indiana 

Thanks for the question Dean! One thing we 
try not to do is get in the way of people making 
decisions about what's best for them. That's why 
we give suggestions, not advice. When it comes to 
labeling the person you're in a relationship with, it's 
best to just make sure it's something both people 
are comfortable with. The trick, again, is to be 
careful of all the linguistic expectations created by 
specific terminology. We know of a couple who spent 
time together for over a year, but the day after they 
adopted the boyfriend /girlfriend terminology one of 
them ended the relationship! So whether you choose 
partner, significant other, boy/ girlfriend, just.be sure

Hi Hana, I heard that the more 
someone explores and experiences 
other cultures, the more someone 
leams about themselves and about their 
own culture. Traveling is my favorite 
hobby. I love visiting new cultures, 
seeing nature and experiencing new 
atmosphere. I have been traveling my 
whole life and I love it, thanks to my 
parents. They are both journalists and 
love to explore and learn new things. 

I have three older sisters that all 
went their separate ways in life. My 
oldest sister lives in Bergan, Norway, 
the second oldest lives in Philadelphia 
and my youngest sister currently 
lives in Santiago, Chile. In December, 
I visited my youngest sister for her 
wedding. 

We went to Patagonia sometime 
after the wedding and visited the 
national park Torres del Paine for four 



days. After hiking through that amazing 
parkil got me really interested in hiking, 
so I found this book that tells about all 
these little unknown hiking trails all 
around Indiana. I live in Kendallville 
and there happens to be two trails right 
near where I live. 1 even found a really 
challenging trail in Huntertown. I think 
readers would be interested in theses 
trails. The book has every trail for each 
county in Indiana. 

Thanks to Paul Housholder, a 
General Studies major at IPFW,

Column. If you would like to talk

been, all you have to do is send

Taste of Indiana: From Farm to Fork 



By Hana Al Hawash 

ha i\a hawaihSgma II .com 



Many students at IPFW that do not live 
at home are used to breakfasts of Reese cups 
and Galorade, lunches of Taco Bell or some 
other pre-packaged snack and dinner can 
usually be summed up to four word recipes: 
add water and microwave. Most students 
from Indiana or the surrounding area have 
had home-cooked meals before, but maybe 
not in the sense of everything used for the 
meal being directly from farms in Indiana. 

If you are tired ofTaco Bell and Ramen 



and would like to try a home style meal 
made from the best and freshest Indiana 
ingredients, try a night out at the Mastodon 
Grill, a restaurant ran in full by ten IPFW 
students in the Advanced Food Service 
Management class. These students have 
planned a themed menu, created a budget 
and business plan, marketed the series and 
they also manage the restaurant. On top 
of this, one of the students cooks all of the 
meals and Kaitlin Shifiey, a hospitality and 
tourism management student, is in charge 
of marketing. 

"There are only ten students but people 
dropped the class, so there are only ten of 



us in charge. The first week we just talked 
about it, but then after that we actually had 
to get the ball rolling. We had some general 
guidelines, but other than that... it was alius. 
This is us running a full-service restaurant," 
said Shifiey. 

The students have set up and put into 
action a serious restaurant; you walk in 
the Holiday Inn restaurant hall and you are 
greeted by a hostess and sat down. A waiter 
serves you just like any other restaurant and 
students are even accepting tips. 

The menu is themed around the idea 
of farm to fork, which is the idea of the 
ingredients being from farms in Indiana. 



People are becoming more concerned with 
traceability of the ingredients in their food, 
so the idea is to keep everything fresh and 
local. What you would find on (he menu are 
meals thai you might find on your mom's 
kitchen table. 

The Mastodon Grill will be open for 
business every Tuesday evening until April 
20th from 5:30-10 in the Holiday Inn on 
Coliseum. IPFW students receive a 15% 
discount and staff/faculty gels 20% off - 
prices range from S 7.99-SI7. The public is 
also welcome, so call for a reservation or 
further inquiries at 260-182-3300. 



Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas 



By Holly Gallaway 

gal Iha0 1 Bitudco HI phv.edu 



"We were somewhere around Barstow 
on the edge of the desert when the drugs 
began to take hold..." As Dr. Hunter 
Stockton (yes, Stockton) Thompson begins 
to list the staggering amount of drugs 
carried in a briefcase in the trunk of his 
red Chevy convertible, the reader begins 
to wonder exactly what they're in for. A 
very similar effect happens to a viewer of 
the movie version. No matter which way 
it's taken in, Dr. Hunter S. Thompsons 



eccentric masterpiece. Fear and Loathing 
in Las Vegas takes a person on a drug-fueled 
trip to the brink of insanity alongside Raoul 
Duke (Thompson himself) and Dr. Gonzo 
(Thompson's lawyerlas they paint Las Vegas 
an interesting array of psychedelic colors 
while chasing the American (and Samoan) 
dream. Those who have read the book or 
seen the movie will know that's a very loose 
and much cleaner version of what really 
happens. Those who have read the book 
and seen the movie will hopefully have 
noticed how closely the movie mirrors the 
book. This movie is as direct a translation 
as possible from the book. It is actually 
possible to watch the movie while following 
along loosely with the book in hand. 



Thompson's stream of consciousness 
writing is the fuel and basis for his gonzo 
journalism — pure, unabashed, raw writing 
that puts his readers in the center of his 
eccentric brain as well as in the center of the 
muck and the action. In Fear and Loathing 
in Las Vegas, he introduces his readers to a 
world they may not have otherwise known. 
In another of his many books, he brings the 
readers into the world of the Hell's Angels. 
Thompson has an unquestionable talent for 
transporting his readers into another world. 
He's very similar to a drug — once you read 
one of his books, you just want more. 

With the movie, fohnny Depp's on-target 
portrayal of Duke/Thompson continues 
to usher new generations of- innocent 



movie goers in to an insanely perverse and 
psychedelic world. The supporting cast of 
Benicio del Toro as Dr. Gonzo and Christina 
Ricci as Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds 
(seriously, you can't make this stuff up) 
shows a world of drug-induced insanity 
that has only been preserved due to the 
recording machine Thompson carried 
across his body. It's recorded in the book 
as a verbatim transcript from the original 
tape. This is what Thompson brought to 
the world — he was brave and crazy enough 
to try things and tell the rest of us about 
them. Keep in mind, everything he showed 
us in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas didn't 
even kill him. This true story is incredible, 
■whether learned by movie or by book.

Upon first meeting him, Mike 
Schaffner seems to be fairly quiet 
and reserved. However, when he 
opens up, he's a relaxed, easy- 
going guitarist who loves 10 read. 
Schaffner plays in Pretender/ 
Contender, a band made up of 
three 1PFW students formed in 
September of 2009. They write 
and perform their own songs and 
are currently in the process of 
recording a five-song album. The 
other members are Lucas Carter 
ton bass and vocals) and Ryan 
Harvey (on drums). After five 
long months, they were able to 
play their first concert at a skate 
park in Muncie back in February. 
They somehow managed to fit all 
their equipment in Schaffncr's 
Jeep Cherokee for the trip down, 
but at some point, the Jeep's back 
window broke. Their next show 
is April 17; it's Record Store Day 



in Muncie. 

Despite only having three 
members in the band, Schaffner 
says they sound "pretty full." 
They are. however, considering 
adding another guitarist. 
Schaffner has been playing 
guitar for five years, but adding 
another guitarist would give him 
a chance to work more with the 
tapping style he recently began 
experimenting with. Schaffner 
says he would like to play music 
professionally, but for now its 
more of a hobby. Schaffner 
describes Pretender/ Contender's 
style as indie-progressive and 
lists two influences as Native and 
This Town NeedsGuns. Native is 
a band from northwest Indiana. 
Schaffner listens to their music 
because he likes their style — "a 
lot of tap guitar," which is what 
Schaffner has recently been 
starting to learn. When they 
write, Schaffner focuses on the 
guitar part, while vocalist Carter 
works on lyrics. In the mad rush 



in preparation for the recording 
of the five-song album, Carter 
and Schaffner sat down and 
"hammered out the lyrics." 

Schaffner is a secondary 
education major and hopes 
to teach English after he 
graduates. He said he wouldn't 
mind teaching at his old high 
school. Heritage, because he 
really enjoyed his time there. He 
definitely wants to try to stay in 
the Fort Wayne area, but knows 
he'll follow his career wherever it 
takes him. He settled on English 
because he likes it better than 
math or science and enjoys 
reading. 

"Yea — I read a lot," Schaffner 
says laughing. He enjoys 
reading Stephen King and Dean 
Koontz. When asked is he had 
ever wanted to write a novel, he 
mentioned starting quite a few 
things, but then always leaving 
them very unfinished. "I've 
always toyed around with it," 
Schaffner admits.

STUDENT HEALTH FAIR 2010 



The IPFW Health fair, where 
different organizations (health 
organizations) such Wal-Mart, IPFW 
pharmacy club and others, took place 
in Walb Union on Wednesday March 
24. There was a section were adelicacy 
(Chicken Provencal) was prepared 
by Chef Nick Perry, as well as free 
massages given by the therapeutic 
massage group. Students who received 
a free massage, like JamesShaw, stated 
"It was like rebirth, just sitting there 
and forgetting all sorrow and worries". 
Also a representative from the Gates 



center was there to help check your 
body fitness. There was also free food 
like popcorns, fruit smoothie, and a 
sign above a barrel of drinks saying 
"Skip the vending machine, eat less 
fat". There were other benches where 
they check the effectiveness of your 
hearing ability and the sensitivity of 
your palm. The event was a success as 
I could conclude, most people were 
happy and anxious to discover some 
details about their body, Others were 
just happy about the free food and to 
socialize with others. 



THE OPPORTUNITY BANQUET 2010 



IPFW hosted its 7 1 " opportunity 
banquet fair on Friday March 26. 
The event witnessed the presence 
of company representatives and 
officials. The event which was 
hosted primarily for the engineering 
students as a reception to meet 
potential company employers also 
had a large number of students in 
attendance. This year, Raytheon, 
General Dynamics, Zimmer along 
with several other companies 
graced the event. The event kicked 
off at about 4:30 p.m. with students 
being able to meet with the various 



reputable companies on either 
inquiry basis or for job employment. 
Then at about 7:30 p.m. dinner was 
served amidst chatting between 
company representatives and 
students at the table. This was 
followed shortly by a talk by the 
guest speaker Dr. Justin Sanchez. 
In general, students enjoyed the 
occasion. Oneofthestudents, Ralph 
Ndeitunga, described the occasion 
as an opportunity for success saying 
"I am glad I participated in this 
event because it gave me a chance to 
partake in productive networking."

' Label: Epitaph 

Release l fate: Man h 2 l, 
2010 

Sounds i ike: 



As far as live albums go, 
a tendency to avoid them 
is prevalent. This album, 
however, sounds crispy in 
every way. 

The songs on this album 
do not run together with 
obnoxious screams from 
the crowd, though they are 
there, they do not come off as 
overbearing. Even if you are 
not familiar with the repertoire 



of the band, this is an enjoyable 
album. The songs follow a 
solid progression and to put 
oneself in the place or seeing 
this as a concert, it lends to an 
enjoyable live experience. 

The recording itself is 
very well mixed and doesn't 
sound simply like the audio 
was taken directly from the 
event. If, however, it was taken 
directly from the event] The 
Weakerthans have live shows 
down to a science because it is 
nearly seamless. 

Familiar or not with the 
band's material, this album is 
worthwhile for just about every 
musical taste out there. The 
lead singer's voice is smooth 
and rarely whiney, the music 
is not too light or heavy, and it 
refrains from becoming boring,

E-waste: A Growing Problem 



By Kelly McLendon 

mclcndDn.kcllyegnull.com 

Cell phones are necessary in today's 
culture; neatly everyone carries one 
and it seems odd if you don't. Unfortu- 
nately, they are not meant to last, and 
getting the newer, betler, more fash- 
ionable model is like updating your 
wardrobe: it happens every season. You 
might be glad to keep the same phone 
forever, but then it quits working. As a 
society, we are constantly replacing our 
techno gadgets and throwing out the 
old ones. 

Electronic waste, or e-waste, refers 
to electrical or electronic devices that 
are thrown out because they are bro- 
ken, obsolete or sometimes just sur- 
plus. These devices contain lead, cad- 
mium, beryllium and bromine, which 
can cause health problems. Entire 
communities can be polluted when the 
metals leach from landfills. Even when 
they are recycled, there is a risk to those 
who handle the products. 

E-Waste is a growing problem 



around the world as electronics be- sold at a profit. But. countries must ac- 

come cheaper and easier to replace cept truckloads of unusable pans and 

than to repair. These lower prices usu- pieces to get a few that can be repaired,

United States

times the recipients of these "recycled"

peace website. It does seem logical that 
the companies who have produced the 
electronics and created the never end- 
ing demand for the newest, coolest 
models should take the responsibility 
for the disposal of their "disposable" 
products. The cost would certainly be 



passed on to consumers. 

Another option is to make consum- 
ers responsible for the disposal of the 
electronics that they purchase to begin 
with. This solution may cause consum- 
ers to think more about the quality and 
life expectancy of the products they 
buy. causing essentially, the manufac- 
turers to make appropriate changes 
as well. It might also 5slow down the 
growing (rend of buying a new cell 
phone to go with every season. 

It might seem like a good idea for 
the US government to stop exporting e- 
waste, but the reality is that even then 
the consumers would bear the brunt 
of the expense and work involved in 
whatever new recycling program or 
legislation is enacted. Greenpeace sug- 
gests that Japan is leading the way in 
solving this global problem, "Japan has 
effective recycling legislation and Sony 
reports that it collects 53 percent of its 
old products in lapan. That's five times 
better than the global average for ma- 
jor PC makers and shows that solutions 
are already available." 



The Bamboo U Line

From reusable bags to energy saving light bulbs

toward the well being of our planet? Clothing 
company Bamboo U is doing just that with a clothing 
line targeted at women and college students. The 
Brentwood, Tenn. -based t-shirt company was 
started in 2008 by leff Fulmer, who wanted to start 
up a company with products that would be as 
environmentally friendly as possible. 

Through some research, this is where he 
discovered bamboo and organic cotton as a -means 
in making t-shirts and fell in love with the way 
the material felt. He thought the two alternative 
ingredients would make for a comfortable t-shirt. He 
also decided to focus his line on the female college 
student demographic. "We are geared to the college 
market because students are often more aware of 
environmental concerns and are open to trying new 
things," Fulmer said. 

Child and adolescent studies major Eunice Kim 
supports and likes the idea of green' shirts. "I would 
gel a shirt that contains organic materials because 
we're giving back to the environment,'' Kim said. 

The shirt is made from 70 percent bamboo and 
30 percent organic cotton and printed with water- 
based inks. Bamboo is the fastest growing plant on 
the planet and is considered an environmentally safe 
product. It contains no chemicals, requires only water 



to grow and is self- regenerating. 

There are many advantages 
to sustainable clothing. All of 
the materials used in sustainable 
clothing are made from sources 
that are renewable, recyclable and 
chemical -free. Regular clothing can 
contain materials that were manufactured 
or produced with pesticides and toxic 
chemicals. 

Along with clean and pure standards regarding 
material, strong moral work ethics are high on the 
list for Fulmer and his company. Before deciding 
on a supplier for Bamboo U, he did research on 
potential companies to make sure that the factories 
were in good condition and that employees worked 
in a safe environment. 

Elizabeth Hesson, a biology major and member 
of the Cal State Fullerton Environmental Advocacy 
Committee, is big on cutting back on waste. She buys 
only biodegradable products and recycling paper. 
She also thinks students on campus would be on 
board with the idea of sustainable clothing. 

"It's great, as long as they're not growing excess 
products to make the shirts with. College kids would 
be into it. With all students, it's all about comfort," 
Hesson said. 

Currendy, the Bamboo U line is limited to only 
t-shirts, but Fulmer would like to expand his offerings 
to hoodies and yoga pants in the near future. For 
now, "we're a small clothing company and we want 
to focus on good quality things," Fulmer said. For

STUDENT ISSUES 



P. 9 



Day of Silence at IPFW 

Students go silent to bring attention to anti-LGBT acts 



By Kristan Mensch 

krbta nbrc jnneOgmai I com 



IPFW will join with a nation-wide event called 
the Day of Silence on April 14. The Day of Silence, 
which began in 1996 and is normally recognized 
on April 16, has "become the largest single student- 
led action towards creating safer schools for all, 
regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity or 
gender expression," according to the official website, 
dayofsiience.org. 

Students from middle school all the way up to col- 
lege are offered a day of silence to bring attention to 
schools and other students anti-LGBT acts, whether 
by harassment, discrimination or otherwise. 

According to Lambda Legal, "Under the Consti- 
tution, public schools must respect students' right 
to free speech. The right to speak includes the right 
not to speak, as well as the right to wear buttons or 
T-shirts expressing support for a cause, without dis- 
crimination based on the message the student is ex- 
pressing." 

Additionally, Lambda Legal also urges those who 
plan to participate in the Day of Silence to share in- 
tentions of silence with instructors prior to the event 
in order to avoid problems. 

In turn, many students from IPFW are vowing to 
stay silent while on campus. 

"Last year we had about thirty to forty active par- 
ticipants," said president of the United Sexualities, 
Andrew Stackhouse, though he said there are be- 
tween fifty and sixty confirmed participants this year. 



Stackhouse is also confident that more people 
will participate this year because it is being held on a 
Wednesday instead of the traditional Friday - mean- 
ing more people will be around campus. 

As said on the "Day of Silence at IPFW" Facebook 
event page, created by United Sexualities, "On this 
day, the main goal is to wear something over your 
mouth to visually silence you." Suggestions are duct 
tape, a bandana, or any selection of written words. 

"Visually silencing" people acts as a reminder to 
the people participating not to speak. Also, it allows 
others to see why they are not speaking and bring 
further attention to the event. 

Also, if staying silent would pose a problem for 
some students, wearing red clothing or writing pro- 
LGBT things on their shirt would be a good way to 
still spread the message, said 



Additionally, the Day of Silence at IPFW will be 
concluded with a "Breaking the Silence" moment. 
That is where those involved can speak for the first 
time after participation in the event. Most common- 
ly, the time is shared with guest speakers, dances or 
the like. 

IPFW's Breaking the Silence moment will be held 
at 6:30 p.m. outside of Helmke Library. There will be 
a guest speaker and everyone "kind of congregates 
- it is a time for everyone to come together. We will 
definitely encourage dialogue as well," said Stack- 
house. 

Last year, passersby gave participants in the 
Breaking the Silence moment "weird looks, dirty 
looks. Some people said anti-homosexual slurs la- 
beled at us, but no one got physical," said Stack- 
house, adding that he would

out "speaking cards" thai, along with an introduction 
to the reason for the Day of Silence, read "My delib- 
erate silence echoes that silence [of LGBT people], 
which is caused by name-calling, bullying and ha- 
rassment. I believe that ending the silence is the first 
step toward fighting these injustices. Think about the 
voices you are not hearing today. What are you going 
to do to end the silence?" 



Shepard was a young man from Wyoming who, in 
199B, was severely beaten and ultimately died from 
injuries sustained in an anti-gay hate crime. Since 
his death, his parents - Dennis and Judy Shepard 
- have created the Matthew Shepard Foundation, 
which honors Matthew and tries to "replace hate 
with understanding, compassion and acceptance," 
according to matthewshepard.org.

The IPFW track and field has been on a heartrend-

the team has set their sights higher than before. 

With four full time field members, (a.k.a. "throw-

goals were set. In all, the team was able to finish with 
seven top-five finishes and the two school records.

than the previous record of 134-8, set by Hayley Bol-

"Our goal is to break at least two records at every 
meet. We were able to do this in the first meet and 
intend to from now on." said Trout. "The indoor sea- 
son was rough with injury and sickness, but we are all 
back and ready to go for the outdoor season."

Volleydons unable to win

Volleydons: Freshman Elon Fyfield had 12 kills 
in the match against the Loyola Ramblers.

With seven games left in the season, the Volleydons 
are trying to make a come-back to top off the year. 
This past weekend, the 'Dons took on the 12th ranked 
Loyola Ramblers and finished flat, 24-30, 30-27, 12- 
30, 24-30. 

The first set opened in favor of the Ramblers as 
they jumped out to an early 6-2 lead, and the leader 
never changed as Loyola hung out and finished, 30- 
24. 

IPFW's determination led them to a strong second 
set. With an eady lead of 10-7, the Mastodons were 
able to hold the lead to win 30-27. 

The third set was an eye opener as IPFW just 
couldn't do anything right. Toward the beginning, 
the 'Dons fought back and forth for the lead, but as 
the score hit 10-7 there was no looking back. IPFW 
finished with only 12 points; Loyola was easily about 
to obtain the lead. The final set was also owned by 
the Ramblers for the win. 

Senior middle hitler Oli Kook took control of the 
match, slamming down the hammer at the net. He 
finished with 13 kills and a hand full of digs. Also 
shining for the evening was freshman Elon Fyfield 
(12) and Darryl Shank (11.) Shank also led the team 
in digs with 15. 

The loss knocked IPFW to 9-12 overall and 2-6 in 
MP/A. 

IPFW plays at home Friday April 2 taking on Penn 
State at 7 p.m. and April 3, IPFW will host Ball State. 
Both defeated IPFW previously in the season, so 
the pressure's on. The Mastodons will play tonight 
(Wednesday, March 31) at Lewis. Starting time is 8 
p.m.

Nearly halfway through die regular 
season for ihe IPFW baseball team, as 
you look down the win/loss column, 
you may find only two "W marks 
scratched into a dirty scorecaid. What 
you won't see, though, are two extra- 
inning heartbreak loses.. You won't 
see four Dons' batting above the .300 
mark. You won't see that junior catch- 
er/first baseman A.I. Christensen has 
belted five baseballs over the outfield 
wall; and what you definitely will not 
see. are the statistics that prove the 
tough swinging dons' are a dangerous 
team on the verge of a breakout. 

Through twenty-two games, that 
have all been played on the road, the 
Dons' have put up very impressive 
numbers. Opponents have left twenty- 
three more players on base than IPFW 
has thus far, and the strong defensive 
Dons' have turned twenty-two double 
plays compared to twenty-one double 
plays turned on IPFW. 

Along with the team leading five 
homers from Christensen, he is also

Conference play hasn't quite 
opened up yet, and for IFPW, break- 
ing out before that time comes could 
be die best thing to happen this sea- 
son. IPFW finishes up their twenty- 
three game road trip Wednesday night, 
March 3 1" at Butler. After the game, the 
Dons come home for six home games. 
presenting a great opportunity to pick 
up a few more wins. For all we know, 
the Dons are unstoppable at home! 

IPFW will open up the homestand 
on Tuesday, April 6 for an afternoon 
double-header against Chicago State 
University. CSU has a record of 1-11 
this season, and IPFW has a great op- 
portunity to boost their confidence 
and really get this season rolling in 
style. After die Chicago State series, in 
comes South Dakota State University 
to open up conference play. The Jacks, 
by record, are slightly better on paper 
than CSU with a 10-6 record. 

Then, the Dons' will welcome in- 
state rival Purdue University, then Orcd 
Roberts University before heading 
back on the road May 7. 

Get out to the baseball diamond 
while you still can! Cheer on the Dons' 
to victory and enjoy the game.
