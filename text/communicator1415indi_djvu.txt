Sociology and ianthropology department opposes honors program 



I IPFW 



By CINDY H 
Staff Wrller 

Although the first formi 
program will be offered 
students this spring semester, the 
sociology and anthropology department 
has voted unanimously not to par- 
ticipate in the program or offer any 
honors courses, said Patrick Ash ton, 
BislslanI professor of sociology. 

The departmental decision not lo 
parUcipate in the program was based 
on philosophical and pragmatic up- 
posilicn. Athlon sold. '"The voting as a 
group was done partly to drama tlie the 
Issues." he said. "The sociology 
deparlmenl is not out to crash the 
honors program," he said, but added 
Ihat Ihe deparlmenl is very concerned 
about raising some questions in regard 
lo the program. 

The philosophical opposition to the 
program stems from the department's 
background in social sciences and 



ethnic and racial groups, as well as 
certain classes of people

lenttonal form of dlscrlmlnatloo.

Ashton said the honors program also 
perpchiales Ihe system of "t^'ackiiig" 
students at Ihe college level. "Tracking

types and levels of classes based on 
perceived abilities or needs." he said. 

The prc*lem with iracking, Ashton 
said. IS thallhe pcrsmial perceptions ol 
counselors often contain biases against 
students based on Iheir social 
backgrounds. He said these biases are 
not a reflection of the personal 
pre]udices of the advisors, but rather 
that they are "systematic — operating 
outside of a person's awareness." 

Sylvia Neely. honors program 
director, described the SAT lesla which 
are used as one of Ihe criteria to 
determine whether or not one can enter 
the honors program as predictions of 
ability. "We have lo start lomewbcrc," 
Neely said. However

Asblon used the sociological lenr 
"definition of the siUialion" lo describi 
the department's pragmatic opposiliot 
to the honors program. "A silualiot 
defined as real is real in its con 
sequences," Ashton said. He added, "Il 
people believe il is true, it Is going tc 
have true consequences whether or no 
Ihat belief is objectively true." 

Applying Ibis Iheory to the honor

Neely said she believes honors 
courses will be a "spur for curriculum"

the local ne*3. Alter a commercial, (he 
newscasler relumed lo the air and 
announced thai Governor Robert On- 
had pa.sscd increases in Ihe sales tax 
from (our lo five percent and Income lax 
from 1,9 to three percenl. Immediately 
Public sal up in disbelief as he threw his 
arms up, knocking off the lomp shade 
while he said, "Inflalion has already 
hurt us enough, now they have to do this 
lous." 

Although Mr. Public is a fictilious 
character, many Hoosiers fell (he same 
way he did tha( Thursday evening in 
December. A lack of planning in the 
stale government caused someone lo 
predict H5Z.1 million deficit for June 30, 
and the state government enac(ed the 
(ax Increases lo make up tor Ihe deficit. 

No one wants lo pay higher taxes, 
including IPFW sludenls along with 
those ol Indiana, Purdue. Ball Stale, 
Indiana Stale and Vincennes univer- 
sities and IVY Tech. However, they look 
at the increases from a different point of 
view. They are happy the legislature 
didn't cut funds lo their inslilu lions and 
make them face a surcharge alter they 
had already paid for their tuition. 

Throughout last semester, we em- 
phasized two points: 

).) A college education can train men 
and women to provide for a belter future 



and help them to think productively in a 
decision making process. 

2.) Higher education must be a high 
priority in the eyes of the stale 
le0slaliire when il decides how much to 
fund other institutions. 

The state budget may be in a bind, bul 
the legislators made Ihe right choice 
when they propcsed tax increases over 
culling funds to slate instutions to erase 
a monstrous deficit. In doing so, they 
preserved the value of higher education 
in Indiana. 

College students at (he University of 
lUinois are lacing a flDO increase in 
fees this semester because the Illinois 
legislature cul funding of higher 
education by two percent. The 
legislators there must not see higher 
education as that high a priority, 

Purdue President John Hicks said, "It 
would have been contrary lo the besl 
interests of the state's economic 
development to have had lo cut back on 
education, particularly the portion of it 
preparing students for employment in 
the high-technology industry so im- 
portant to the stale's economic health." 

IPFW Vice Chancellor for Financial 
Affairs John Carnaghi was quoted in the 
"IPFW Intercom" as saying. "It might 
have been more expedient, and certainly 
a lot easier lo have cut education. Bul 
our legislators had the wisdom to realize 
the value of education lo the state." 

We couldn't agree more.
