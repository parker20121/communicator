By MICHELE R. SHAFFER 
Managing Editor 

The Indiana University Board of Trustees approved the Management and 
Academic Mission Friday, Oct. 4. Under the new fiscal management 
agreement, the IPFW chancellor will report only to the Purdue University 
president, rather than the presidents of both Purdue and Indiana University. 

The board approved the draft of the agreement, five to one, with Carolyn 
Gutman being the only trustee to vote against the proposal Trustees Betty 
Blumberg Polley and Emerson Kampen were absent. 

Under the new agreement, Purdue University will appoint the IPFW chan- 
cellor, pending approval by IU. The chancellor will then only have to report to 
one president. 

"On important matters, the chancellor will report to one president, then the 
two presidents will talk about it, ' ' said Edward Nicholson, acting chancellor. 

Nicholson said he didn't think people would be able to tell the difference, since 
the decision only streamlines the managing, making it easier for ihe chancellor 
and both presidents. 

"I doubt students will know the difference," added Nicholson. 

The agreement states that both presidents will consult on a regular basis 
concerning major matters like personnel and budget decisions, and community 



The agreement furiher slates "Purdue is hereby designated as Ihe respon- 
sibility to manage and operate IPFW for the benefit of Indiana University and 
Purdue University and do all things necessary and proper fur tlwt purpose " 

Carolyn Gutman. an Indiana University trustee from Fort Wayne, s till feels 
the decision may not be in the best interest of the campus. "This agreement, 
which is little more than a handshake between two presidents who know one 
another and respond well to one another, will be the model for others lo come. 
What happens when one or both of those persons are no longer in the 
presidential role?" Gutman asked Friday. 

A few weeks back, the Arts and Letters faculty at IPFW authored a resolution 
containing specifics aimed at guarding IU programs. When asked il the formal 
agreement contained all or parts of this resolution, Nicholson said he hadn't 
seen a copy of the formal agreement. "I don't know anything abuut it," said 
Nicholson. 

Gutman fears the agreement could offer future presidents the opportunity to 
give Purdue more control. "There's a lot of latitude in that agreement," she 
said. 

Beering and Ryan assured people Friday that the agreement will change 
only matters relating to Purdue's responsibilities in the area of fiscal ami 
management decisions. 

When asked if he was happy with this formal decision, Nicholson replied, 
"Yes, I've been in favor of this all along. " 



Harvest survey reveals fate of workers 



By LILLY LYON 
Copy Editor 

What happens to employees when a 
plant closes? Two IPFW sociology 
professors were commissioned by 
International Harvester to find out 
what happened to the 4,549 former IH 
employees terminated between July 
1970, and December 1984. 

With thesupport of UAW locals 57 and 
305, Patrick J. Ashton, assistant 
professor, and Peter ladicola, associate 
professor, targeted their research 
to Tour groups of employees, blacks, 
white factory workers, while managers 
and white salaried workers in technical 
and clerical positions. 

Sample sizes were set at 100 each per 
group, with the exception of 350 for 
white factory workers. However, ac- 
cording to Ashton, "Our black sample 
had to drop out because we could only 
find 23 or so of them. There wasn't 
enough time or money to find the 100 
needed for Ihe sample." Only whites, 
then, were surveyed. 

During the survey period, which 
lasted from January to August, 1985, 
Ashton and ladicola sampled 555 total 
respondents. They found a large per- 
centage had found new jobs, managers 
the most successful, with B4 percent 
currently working fulltime. Four 
percent of the managers are working 
part-time. Of the factory workers, 88 
percent are currently employed, with 
10 per cent on a part-lime basis. Less 
than three-fourth of the salaried em- 
ployees are working. 

Of those back to work, 39 percent of 
the factory workers, 61 percent of the 
managers and 34 percent of the salaried 
workers are still employed in the 
manufacturing industry. 

Ashton and ladicola discovered 60 
percent of the managers are more 
satisfied now than at IH, and only 20 
percent said they were less satisfied. 
Slightly more factory workers are more 
satisfied than those less satisfied now. 

Finding new jobs took about 17 weeks 
or more for half the factory workers. It 
look only six weeks for almost half the 
managers and an average of 13 weeks 
all-in-all for the salaried workers. 
However, unemployment benefits, 
including state benefits and the union's 



Supplemental Unemployment Benefit 
(SUB pay), had run out for 40 percent of 
Ihe factory workers, 35 percent of 
salaried employees, and 16 percent of 
the managers. 

With the closing of the IH plant came 
concern for the reluctance of employers 
to hire former IH workers. High per- 
centages in all three groups said they 
were concerned by this: 62 percent 
factory, 56 percent salaried and 46 
percent managers. 

Ninety-two percent of the respon- 
dents who had looked for new jobs since 
the IH closing were surveyed about 
specific job-related assistance, such as 
identifying and developing new skills, 
preparing resumes, interviewing and 
locating new employment. 



than 50 percent of Ihe salaried workers 
and 62 percent of the managers enrolled 
in similar work-related programs. Over 
75 percent of the factory workers 
enrolled in programs unrelated to their 
jobs at IH. Of both the factory and the 
salaried workers, 42 percent obtained 
degrees or certificates, as did 26 per- 
cent of the managers. 

Changes in income were varied, with 
salaried workers experiencing the 
greatest drop, from an average high of 
$25,201 to a current S13.253. Factory 
workers dropped from an average of 
S22.96B, lo a current $16,755. Managers 
currently get an average of $27,924 
dwon from $31,616. 

Family assests also suffered from the 
job loss (assets include autos, homes. 




A majority (58 percent) cited the IH 
Outplacement Center as a source of aid. 
Other sources identified were 
educational institutes, and state and 
federal agencies (the Comprehensive 
Employment and Training Act ( CETA) 
agency and the Jobs Partnership 
Training Act iJPTA) agency). Forty- 
seven percent of those in the job market 
received help in finding a new job. 
However, 61 percent of those workers 
received help from individuals, not 
institutions or agencies . 

Twenly-nine percent of the surveyed 
workers enrolled in an educational 
program since losing their jobs. Less 



bank accounts, and investments). 
Factory workers lost a mean of about 
$6,159; managers lost approximately 
$5,589; salaried workers lost almost 
$4,3%. However, only a minority of 
respondent suffered losses: 37.4 per- 
cent factory workers, 34.3 percent 
managers, and 28.6 percent salaried. 
The total asset loss amounted to ap- 
proximately $3,135,300. 

Spending patterns of respondents 
dropped in areas such as health in- 
surance, health and dental care, life 
insurance ad entertainment. There was 
an increase, however, in spending on 
education and training. 



The effects of job loss go deeper than 
the monetary decrease Fifteen percent 
of factory workers, 13 percent ol 
managers and 17 percent of salaried 
workers changed their marital status 
Twenty percent of both salaried arid 
factory workers reported a change, foi 
beller or worse, in their relationships 
with their spouses; 29 percent ol 
managers reported Ihe relationships 
improved, while 13 percent reported 
they worsened, Twelve percent ol 
factory workers and managers noted 
improved relationships will) their 
children, and 11 percent of the salaried 
workers noted a worseriyd relationship 

Menial health of former 111 worker; 
suffered during their jobless period 
Depression rates were highest in 
salaried employees (50 percent) 
followed by factory workers I4B per- 
cent) and managers (24 percent! 
Anger and anxiety increased also 
among the former employees, as did ,i 
general feeling of loss of control in theil 
lives and low self-esteem. 

When questioned about (tie cause ol 
their unemployment, Uie respondents 
listed inlerest rales and foreign com- 
petition as Iwo major reasons. Over 91) 
percent of each group named these two 
factors. Other factors noted were labor 
unions and big business. 

In general, most former IH workers 
still felt the same about Fort Wayne as 
a place to live 165 percent factory, 70 
percent managers and 60 percent 
salaried). Seventeen percent 
managers, 10 percent factory and 12 
percent salaried workers indicated a 
better opinion of Fori Wayne. However, 
17 percent factory, 19 percent salaried 
and nine percent managers reported 
decreased image. 

"We hope Ihe good (of the survey) is 
that corporations and the community 
realize the real cost of a plant shut- 
down, both financial and human," 
Ashton concluded. 

"I think it is highly significant (Ihe 
survey)," he added, "there are two 
important things about this study; il 
covers white collar as well as blue 
collar workers, and il has a high 
reliability. We contacted almost 100 
percent (of the workers) for our 
sample."

AIDS. These four letters are causing 
needless panic and anxiety. Caution is 
appropriate — fear is not. 

The average person's chances of 
contracting AIDS (Acquired Immune 
Deficiency Syndrome) are small, and 
the Fort Wayne medical community 
wants to provide current, accurate 
information about AIDS to dispel the 
many misconceptions. 

The main thing to remember about 
AIDS is it is not spread through casual 
social contact. Direct sexual contact 
with an infected person is the major 
cause of the disease. "Avoiding sexual 
promiscuity is the best step we can take 
toward eliminating AIDS," said Dr. 
Pamela Kelly, an infectious disease 
specialist in Fort Wayne. Specialists 
advise to use caution and be sure of the 
health of sexual partners. There is no 
evidence that AIDS is transmitted 
through sweat, saliva, or through the 
air. 

The chances of acquiring AIDS 
through a blood transfusion are ex- 



tremely small; less than 1 percent 
according to Dr. Kelly. However, blood 
collecting agencies in Fort Wayne use a 
blood screening test, which checks for 
AIDS antibodies, on all blood. This is 
proving successful in limiting blood 
product-related cases of AIDS and 
making our blood supply safe against 
infection of the disease. 
There have been five cases of AIDS in 



Fort Wayne, with three deaths at- 
tributed lo Ihe disease, according to Dr. 
Olive Kaiser, Deputy Heallh Com- 
missioner for Allen County. National 
statistics indicate this figure will 
double in the next year. 

"The scientific and medical com- 
munities are researching AIDS as 
deeply as time and money permits," 
said Dr. Kaiser. The U.S. Senate this 



week voted to designate S22I million

Student senate discusses issues 



By EARL SMITH 

Chief Reporter 

After two weeks without a quorum. 

Student Senate acted on a number of 

items. 

A resolution was passed encouraging 
Indiana and Purdue Universities to 
remain equal partners in Fort Wayne. 
It also stated the principles of the Arts 
and Letters faculty resolution should 
be considered as an effective means of 
insuring the powers of each respective 
university. 
Last Friday, the resolution was 



presented to the Student Affairs 
Section of the Indiana University 
Board of Trustees. 

Student Body President Joe 
Motherwell read the letters he 
received from IPFW faculty and 
administrators in regard to the 
Student Senate resolutions on HPER 
classes and the new fine arts building. 
Concern was expressed by senators 
that electives in other divisions might 
also be eliminated. One senator 
wondered if Division of Education 
electives were being singled out for 
elimination 



Acting Chancellor Edward 
Nicholson, in a letter regarding the 
Fine Arts resolution, listed some 
possible ways to continue interest in 
the fine arts issue. Senator Julia 
Knisely was appointed to chair a 
special ad-hoc fine arts committee to 
promote building a fine arts facility on 
campus. 

Two new senators were approved lo 
fill vacancies. James Hillaire is a 
Purdue biology major and Anne 
Remek is a Purdue engineering major

The decision is made: 
Let's work together 



The Indiana University Board of 
Trustees approved the new management 
agreement Friday, Oct. 4. The Purdue 
trustees are expected to approve the 
agreement at the meeting Nov. 15. 

Under the new agreement, Purdue will 
appoint the new chancellor with IU's 
approval. The chancellor will then only 
report to the Purdue president. On 
important matters, the two presidents 
will confer in decision making. 

John Ryan, Indiana University 
president and Steven Beering, Purdue 
University president have assured us 
that Indiana academic programs will 
not be adversely affected. But some 
people still grasp the fear that the hand 
with money will also hold the power 
namely Purdue. 

Carolyn Gutman, an Indiana Trustee 
member, still feels that the latitude in 
the agreement could mean future 
university presidents might allow 
Purdue more control. 

Hopefully, Ryan and Beering will 
stand by their word and remain fair to 
both university programs We cannot 
stress enough the importance of Ryan 
and Beering maintaining close contact 
with each other. They cannot lose the 
goals set by our founding fathers that the 
two universities should thrive together 
on one campus. 

Nor should the chancellor tor acting 
chancellor) lose sight of this original 
goal, He or she should keep close watch 



on all programs to ensure none suffer 
from this decision. 

There probably is still a lot of 
resentment and fear of the change 
lingering in the air because the 
community was given no opportunity for 
input. Even after all the media coverage 
or this incident, officials ignored the 
community's request for interaction. 

However, if all administrative 
officials involved police the activities 
closely, perhaps the fears of Carolyn 
Gutman and so many like her, will be 
disquelled. 

However, we should mention here that 
this accomplishment will only occur if 
Ryan, Beering and the chancellor keep 
open honest lines of communication 
between officials, faculty, students and 
community members. 

It is time to stop the bickering. The 
management decision has been made, 
pending Purdue's approval. All this 
arguing, back-biting and palm greasing 
should stop. We need to unite and prove 
to the whole community that we really 
are striving for excellence at IPFW. 

However, let it be known that we will 
continue to be your watchdog; that is our 
responsibility We do not like to be 
ignored. We wanted input and you felt it 
unnecessary. If we see things being 
weighed heavily in favor of one 
university, we will not lay back and let it 
happen. 

Remember ... we are watching.

Ft. Wayne pulling together 
to keep city working 



In Ireland: pouring tea, a promotion? 



How do you feel about graduating 
from college only to become one among 
hundreds in an unemployment line? 

According to the International 
Harvester former employees survey 
conducted by IPFW sociology professors 
Patrick Ashton and Peter ladicola, 
being unemployed means more than just 
the loss of income. Marital and family 
relationships suffer, as do mental health 
and self-esteem. 

It's time for Fort Wayne to really bear 
down and get businesses to develop 
within our reach, With hundreds of 
college students graduating each year, 
on top of those workers previously laid- 
off or out of jobs, the unemployment rate 
in Northern Indiana will sky-rocket. 

Mayor Win Moses and the City 
Council need to draw industry to Fort 
Wayne. With General Motors developing 
south of town, we're on our way. But 
more needs to be done. 

We suggest Mayor Moses promote 
Fort Wayne in depth. Stress our All- 
America status, stress our Most 
Liveable City award. By improving Fort 
Wayne's image in the eyes of major 
businesses, we can draw attention and 
encourage industry to build here, A good 
image of Fort Wayne will reflect on 



businesses who move here. 

City Council should work and plan with 
county officials for the development of 
land outside the city limits. Compromise 
should be an operative word among local 
officials. If businesses find our local 
government willing to work to make 
their moving here easy and beneficial to 
them as well as to us, then they'll think 
twice before passing us by 

Local unions, too, should be open for 
compromise with industries who may 
choose to relocate in Fort Wayne. A job 
with fewer benefits or lower pay than a 
previous job is better than being 
unemployed, and unions should consider 
their members in this respect. 

Other businesses should welcome new 
industry to Fort Wayne, Competition 
generates better business, higher sales, 
and increased technology. A stronger 
economy in Northern Indiana means 
steady business for local industry. 

If Fort Wayne works together to bring 
business to our city, there won't be 
another plant closing like International 
Harvester. So, Mayor Moses, council 
men and women, and citizens of Fort 
Wayne, let's pull together, and keep our 
city working. 



Heckler rooked 



Why did the President 
Offer HHS Secretary 
Margaret Heckler a 
diplomatic post in Ireland? 
Lebanon was filled. 

We're now seeing 
Republican feminism in 
action. The men go to cut 
deals on Wall Street and the 
women go to cut ribbons in 
Ireland. 

In the Reagan 

Administration what do they 
call it when a woman is 
forced out of a major 
Cabinet position and sent 
overseas to pour tea? A 
promotion. 

—providing (he promotion 
is accompanied by a pay cut. 

I understand Elizabeth 
Dole was offered a 
promotion but she doesn't 
like the weather in Latvia.

We're so sorry 



Not just a Hollywood problem: 
It can strike our area, too 



It's not just a Hollywood problem. It 
exists in Indiana, and It exists in Fort 
Wayne. 

AIDS. Acquired Immune Deficiency 
Syndrome. 

This disease has spread quickly and 
fatally, striking down victims across the 
nation and around the world. 

Yet people are trying to keep AIDS 
victims out of public schools and public 
places. In Kokomo, parents of 
elementary school children are trying to 
ban a young boy from classes. Yet there 
is no evidence of the transmission of 
AIDS in any contact other than sexual. 

These parents say it is unfair to their 
children to allow a victim of AIDS to 
attend classes at the same school. But it 
is discrimination to deny an education to 
the victim of the disease, and it is they 
who are unfair to refuse this student his 
right to an education. 



In Kansas City, a local court has 
ordered a man to abstain from any 
sexual contact after he was diagnosed as 
having AIDS. When the man refused to 
abide by this order, the courts decided to 
have him followed and brought into 
custody if he attempts to engage in any 
sexual contact. 

This is an out-and-out infringement of 
a person's constitutional rights. This 
man has no legal restraint on his sexual 
preferences, yet the courts of Kansas 
City propose they can enforce such 
limits. 

Both the man and the boy have rights 
that are irrevocable. It is beyond the 
limits of justice to deny an education or 
restrain sexual preference on thee basis 
of health, on a disease which is not 
transmitted orally. This is America, the 
land of freedom of choice, after all. 



Belgium is mad at us. It 
seems President Reagan 

didn't invite Ihem to his pre- 
summit meeting with 
Western leaders in New 
York. I hope he recon- 
siders—I hate to see a gown 
nation sulk. 

Holland is mad at us— for 
the same reason. What's 
with these people? You 
would think we were sending 
them Margaret Hickler or 
something. 

Speaking of which 
—Ireland is mad at 
us— over the clumsy ap- 
pointment of Ambassador- 
Designate-Oh, all right-Ill 
go-Margaret Heckler. You 
can't blame them. The last 
three American am- 
bassadors arrived and told 
the cab driver to wait. 

And then, there's France. 
You guessed it — mad at us. 
It seems we announced the 
meeting without checking 
the date with Mitterrand 
It's his bowling night. 

And so, Reagan prepares 
to meet with Gorbachev — 
the first Russian leader in 
modem times whose wife 
weighs less than he does. 




Take Russia 

Say, here's a switch 
— Shiite Moslems have 
taken Russians hostages. 
The Soviet television net- 
works would cover it but the 
one camera is in the shop. 

After taking Russians 
hostages, the Shiites 
probably presented their 
demands to our State 
Department. 

Another probability— the 
Shiites said to Moscow, 
"Give in to us, or we'll at- 
tack the American 
Embassy," 

Actually, the Shiite action 
was in protest against 
Russia's ally, Syria. The last 
Ume we looked, the Shiites 
and Syria were friends but 
that was before the new 
Terrorist Handbook came 
out.

Xerox withdrawal 

How do you plan to 
celebrate the upcoming 25lh 
anniversary of the invention 
of the Xerox machine? I 
don't know either but I plan 
to do it twice. 

Imagine one day in the 
year when nothing is 
Xeroxed— sort of a Great 
American Smoke-Out for 
copying machines. Xerox 
withdrawal is painful to 
watch. Addicts sneak into 
the balhroom and copy 
things in longhand, 

In 25 years the world has 
produced more Xerox copies 
than babies Instead of 



producing— we've been 
reproducing. 

In Washngton we have at 
least four more Cabinet level 
departments than we had 25 
years ago. All because a 
Xerox machine went berserk 
one day and had to be put lo 
sleep. 

If you look at photographs 
of Congressmen Jack Kemp 
and Newt Gingrich, it is 
clear that Gingrich is the 
Xerox copy. However, Kemp 
Is not the original. In 
Washington there are no 
originals.

Ft. Wayne works to improve mental health service 



By EARL SMITH 
Chier Reporter 
An IPFW professor toured 
Chinese and Soviet mental 
health facilities this sum- 
mer. 

George Leddick, assistant 
professor of education and 
coordinator of the Counselor 
Education Program was one 
of 27 delegates from the 
American Mental Health 
Counselors Association to 
tour three mental health 
facilities in China and two 
mental health facilities in 
the Soviet Union from May 
24toJune9,1985. 

"The purpose was to 
establish contact with 
professionals worldwide," 
said Leddick. 



association 



fessionals then in the 
Soviet Union, said Leddick. 
"'The Soviets were much 
more secretive ; we only saw 
empty rooms,'" said Led- 
dick. 

"The Chinese and Soviets 
tend lo concentrate only on 
people who are overly 
psychotic," said Leddick, In 
China, 70 percent of those in 
mental hospitals suffer from 
schizophrenia, said Leddick. 

One reason is the lack of 
resources. 

The Chinese Cultural 

Revolution delayed progress 
in Ihe mental health field, 
said Leddick. "During the 
Cultural Revolution in- 
tellectuals were relieved of 
their jobs and relocated," 
said Leddick. 

Counseling practices 
which place emphasis on an 



individual feelings are 
discouraged. "They think 
counseling might be a 
dangerous thing to do 
because of policital re- 
education," said Leddick. 

While Freudian 

psychology is still taboo, 
Leddick was surprised the 
Chinese wilt admit Mao 
could make mistakes. 

Leddick was impressed 
with the Chinese aftercare 
program in which a former 
mental patient is re- 
integrated into society. "In 
China there are many neigh- 
borhood clinics. These 
provide basic health ser- 
vices as well as aftercare 
and other mental health 
services," said Leddick. 

Leddick found the mental 
hospitals in China to be 



similar to those in Indiana 
and said Indiana ranks 48th 
among the states in the 
amount spent on state 
supported mental health 
services. 

This situation has existed 
for many years, but now a 
group of parents and 
relatives of the mentally ill 
is working to improve the 
mental health system. 

The Fort Wayne Alliance 
for the Mentally III 
(FWAMI) began as a sup- 
port group with the 
assistance of the Mental 

Health Center iNow Park 
Cenlerl. "I simply asked for 
a support group to help me 
understand a new and 
frightening event in my life 
— my son's schizophrenia," 
said Phyllis Patton, the 



group's founder. 

Park Center provided a 
staff member, Joan Coslow 
"Our group began in Joan's 
office with two people: me 
pumping Joan dry with all 
my unanswered questions 
about the chronically 
mentally ill and how to 
cope," said Patton. 

"What was my 'spark' of 
desperate need back in 
February, I960, has become 
a 'prairie fire' under the 
leadership of our two 
presidents, Ralph Beardsley 
and Evelyn Taylor," said 
Pallon. 

Since its founding, the 
group has grown' to 125 
members and become a not- 
for-profit corporation. "We 
have begun to educate our 
legislators and become 
involved in effecting 



changes," said Patton. 
During the 1985 legislature, 
Joann Smith, co-vice- 
president, authored Senate 
Bill 331, which became law, 
said Patton. Other members 
have spoken lo IPFW 
classes, to community 
groups, and have been in- 
terviewed on radio and 
television. 



Every month new people 
come in search of answers 
"for many it is their first 
encounter with someone who 
fully comprehends and 
understands our feelings," 
said Patton. For others it is a 
means of getting answers 
and working to improve the 
situations which our families 
face. 

Those wanting lo contact 
the Alliance for the Mentally 
111 may call the Park Center.

You know sometimes you 
have to wonder how do large 
organizations get anything 
accomplished I mean, every 
individual member has an 
opinion; everyone has some 
amount of self-interest in 
mind. Think of a large in- 
stitution: the array of 
personalities, and the 
college of interdependent 
needs. Whew! Talk about 
"tug-of-wars"! Just use your 
imagination! 

The amazing reality is that 
large institutions are 
responsible for the quality of 
life and the benefits our 
society enjoys The reason 
for those accomplishments 
is based upon the split- 
personality of organizations. 
On a macro-level, a large 
institution is a coherent body 



striving toward common 
goals. Yet on a micro-level, 
one is confronted with a 
complex matrix of depar- 
tments and small groups. 

How, one wonders, could 
such a myriad web of in- 
terest groups cooperate to 
bring about the ac- 
complishments which are

Music department changes 



B\ SEBASTIAN CHAPMAN 
Staff Writer 
IPFW's music department 
will undergo several 
changes this season. The 
first has already occurred 
with the appointing of a new 
chairman. Dr James A tor. 

Aided by eight full-time 
and 35 part-time instructors, 
Ator plans to develop the 
department by recruiting 
more students from local 
high schools. "We'll be doing 
much more fund raising this 
year," he said. "This will 
hopefully allow the depar- 
tment to offer more 
scholarships than it has in 
past years" 

Approximately 75 
scholarships were offered 



this year, ranging from $100- 
$500. "LT we- HPFW) are 
going to successfully 
compete for talented 
students with other schools, 
we have to attract their 
attention by offering more 
scholarships." the chairman 
said. "That's exactly why 
we'll be doing more fund 
raising." 

The first fund-raising 
event scheduled is the 
Dickens Dinner, to beheld in 
the Student Union Ballroom, 
Dec. 5. 6 and 7. "It's a dinner 
and music program com- 
bined with excerpts from 
some of Charles Dickens' 
literature," Ator said. The 
program has existed for 15 



years and usually draws a 
crowd of 1,500 or more for 
thethreenights. 

The chairman feels 
although the music school is 
small, it is very good. "We 
have a very high quality 
faculty," he said. He added 
students here receive more 
attention than they would if 
they attended a larger 
university. This is something 
he plans to stress while 
recruiting. 

There will also be eight 
choral and instrumental 
concerts this semester. Ator 
feels this will be a good 
reason for the music school 
and the visibility of the 
school will definitely in- 
crease.

IPFW ceramics club 



By GARY LACY 
Staff Writer 

Many people may not 
realize the events and ac- 
tivities that the ceramics 
club at the fine arts complex 
at 1026 W. Berry St. perform. 
The club is ineeed an alive 
and prosperous group whose 
members work extremely 
hard in fulfilling its purpose. 

"Anyone who has signed 
up for ceramics class and 
has paid tuition is 
automatically eligible to 
become a member," stated 
Nancy McCrosky, ceramics 
professor at the fine arts 
department. "The club 
raises money for various 
events that relate to the 
department and for extra 
equipment." The money 
raised helped the club 
members to recently buy an 
expensive pottery wheel that 
no university would consider 
purchasing, because it 
wasn't practical This ex- 
pensive wheel works with 
larger amounts of clay. 



The art students can 
donate their graded work for 
sale, and an example of this 
is the upcoming Christmas 
pottery sale taking place 
November 20. The money 
from the sales is donated to 
the art department's ac- 
count in the Bursar's Office 
at Kettler Hall. 

The ceramics club, which 
is an extracurricular ac- 
tivity, works mainly in 
getting well-known artists to 
come to Fort Wayne. The 
year-old club has spent half 
of their funds to bring 
nationally renowned artist 
Andrea Gill to town, and are 
working on getting other 
differentarlistsasweli. 

Club members also 

sponsor juried ceramics 
exhibits, one being held 
recently in Indianapolis 
These exhibits award prizes 
to those art students with 
outstanding entries. "Club 
members help each other 
take work to a juried show," 



noted McCrosky. "This helps 
them to cooperate." Only the 
advanced level art students 
can get into juried shows, 
and some have won awards. 

McCrosky has been with 
the art department for four 
years, and finds it a 
rewarding experience. She 
also comments on the 
ceramics club as being a 
"vehicle for social in- 
teraction" and a chance to 
work with others. "The club 
really improves the quality 
of our art students' 
education," included 
McCrosky. 

Each time the ceramics 
club schedules an event at 
IPFW, the entire university 
benefits. "Any event is 
open to the general public, 
and the art students would 
like to encourage others to 
attend," replied McCroskv. 
"A visiting artist can 
stimulate anyone interested 
in ceramics or any other 
contemporary art."

"We're like aliens on a new 
planet, or people thrown intc 
a threatening new en- 
vironment like a con- 
centration camp when we 
first encounter 'Tobacco 
Hoad'," said director Larry 
L. Life, assistant professor 
of theatre at Indiana 
University-Purdue Uni- 
versity at Fort Wayne. 
"We don't know how we 
would act if we were in these 
people's situations. We don't 
know whether to laugh, cry, 
or tremble with fear." 

The earthy and powerful 
"Tobacco Road," by Erskine 
Caldwell, sold millions of 
copies as a novel and was 
translated into 15 languages. 
The play ran on Broadway 
for seven years, which was 
then a record run. and road 
companies regularly trouped 
"Tobacco Road" through the 
hinterland (or years 
thereafter. 



Life said "Tobacco Road" 
has sustained its reputation 
as a classic of the American 
theatre because it provokes 
both belly laughs and tears, 
presents unforgettable 
characters, and makes a 
still-timely political point 
about the plight of farmers 
whose lands and destinies 
have been taken out of their 
hands. 

The play concerns the 
Jeeter Lester family and 
their neighbors along 
Tobacco Road — a lonely, 
isolated dead end in Hie 
heart of rural Georgia at the 
depths of the Great 
Depression. But the Lesters' 
isolation is not only 
geographic; they also are 
victims of spiritual and 
emotional isolation. The 
hilarious depiction of the 
Lester family's jexuoj 
misadventures layers a

The comedy quickly turns

Gayle in benefit concert 



Crystal Gayle will be 
appearing in concert to 
benefit the Fine Arts 
Foundation at the Hilton 
Hotel in Ft Wayne, Friday. 
October 11th. 

Combining pop, country 
and blues, Crystal is an 
artist whose style is hard to 
categorize and whose appeal 
is as diverse as the voice 
itself. When asked about her 
style of music, she replies, 
"I never label my music. I 
just try to sing good songs 
and hope that as many 
people as possible like what 
they're hearing." 

In Ft. Wayne, Crystal will 
be performing songs from 
her new album, "Nobody 
Wants To Be Alone," in- 
cluding her current hit 
single, "A Long and Lasting 
Love," as well as many of 
her past hits. 

As her fans know, and 
anyone who sees her soon 
finds out, Crystal sings from 
the heart, and that's what 
great music and performing 
are all about.

Defense conies first for IPFW basketballers 



IPFW men's baskelball 
coach Tim Russell hopes his 
leain can establish a 
"defense first" attitude, as 
their practice starts next 
Tuesday. 

Russell, in his fourth year 
of coaching the Mastodons, 
comments, "We want to 
establish a positive attitude 
toward defense very early, 



and then begin working on 
the transition game. " 

In Russell's first year at 
IPFW, lime was very limited 
for recruiting, but he com- 
pensated by establishing a 
controlled offense, thus 
limiting the opponent's 
opportunity to score. Russell 
has kept with a more con- 
trolled, slower tempo for the 



past two years. 

The situation may be 
changing this year, however. 
"We are looking for a new 
image this year," Russell 
says. "Our team strength is 
quickness, and we want to 
make that work for us on 
offense and defense. I 
foresee a lot of pressing and 
running." 




According lo Russell and 
Assistant Coach C. C. 
Fullove, this could be one of 
the most talented teams in 
FPFW's history. In its second 
season in the Great Lakes 
Valley Conference, the 
Mastodon's competitors will 
be tough this year. 

Seven people return from 
last year, while eight new 
members will be playing. Of 
the returners, there are 
Steve Driver, Jay Layman, 



Richard Ivy, David Lutes. 
Jim Morlan, Greg 
VanDeWater, and Charles 
Washington The newcomers 
include Bruce Erwin, Jeff 
Johns, Lawrence Jordan, 
Schann Leathers, Eric 
Methany, Scott Reed, Bruce 
Roland, and Eric Wilson. 

Nov. 23 marks the season 
opener for the Mastodons, 
against former Division II 
national champion Wright 
State. 



Soccer 

"It was a very physical 
game," TPFW Soccer Coach 

Ed Stefankiewicz comments 
about the Bellarmine contest 
on Oct. 5. The Mastodons lost 
2-0, bringing their record lo 
4-6, as of Monday 

"They haven't met the 
high expectations that were 
set (for them). Our biggest 
problem is a lack of scoring 
ability. We haven't been 
really quick on offense, 
except against Saint 
Francis," Stefankiewicz 



In Brief 

says. "Our goal is lo have a 
winning season. We need to 
have patience ilhat the 
expectations will be met), 
and hope that the team will 
come around." 

Golf 

The IPFW golf team 

finished their season last 
weekend with the Great 
Lakes Valley Tournament. 
In the two day event, held at 
Bellarmine University at 



Louisville, Kentucky, the 
Mastodons finished in 9th 
place. 

Team scores include first- 
place Lewis, with 637, 
Northern Kentucky In 
second at 642; third-place 
Indiana Central at 645; Saint 
Joe, in fourth place, with a 
646; host Bellarmine, in fifth 
with 648; Southern Indiana, 
in sixth, with a 659; seventh 
place Ashland with 664; 
eighth place Kentucky 
Wesleyan, with a 682 and 
IPFW in ninth place with a 
690. 



Team awaits season 



IPFW's women's 

basketball team has a new 
coach this year. Julie 
Calahan will get her first 
look at the Lady Mastodons 
this Tuesday, at their first 
practice. 

There will also be two new 
student assistant coaches, 
Rhonda Unverferth and Joan 
Wenning, last season's top 
two scorers and rebounders 
Diane Thomas will be in her 
fourth year as the team's 
assistant coach. 

"We are ready to get 
started in the gym," Calahan 
says. "We have worked hard 



through our conditioning 
program, and both the 
coaches and players are 
excited about getting 
started." 

There is a lot to learn in a 
very short time, and the first 
several weeks will be spent 
concentrating on fun- 
damentals. We will build 
from there into our offense 
and defense. I believe a 
fundamentally strong team 
is a superior team. You have 
to do the little things right,"
