Now it is an uphill battle to convince 
legislators to spend $4.1 million for 

If past spending history lends any 
iiishficaiKin, IPFW ought to be given 
money to build the gym. Smaller 
aimpuses already have such buildings. 
In fact. I.U. South Bend was allocated

kirikly, in the form of letters and phone 
calls, can show legislators that Fort 
Wayne wants this building. On the other 
hand, if such support is lacking, all the 
reasoned justification in the world will 
not get the allocation through both 
houses of the legislature. 

Most urban campuses have some 
problems of lack of identity. This 
campus has one. While the new 
recreational building will not solve this 
problem entirely it may serve to bring 
some sense of community to the campus. 
A multi-purpose facility used by faculty, 
staff and students will be a plus for 
IPFW in recruiting and retaining faculty 
•;i.:ill .iml sludents. Intercollegiate sports 
will benefit greatly with the new 
building. Better practice and training 
facilities will help. Also, home games 
being played on this campus, will attract 
better crowds— always beneficial to any 
sports program.
