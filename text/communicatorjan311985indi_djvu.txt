Art students need facility 



TTw! current fin* arts facilily of IPFW 
ih tocaicd downtown in ancient, 
dilapidated buildings BesidEs havtng lo 
Iravcl about tewen mites round-trip from 
the mam campus lo th? facility, students 
are concerned about itieir safety while 
going toand from clanes held downtown 
at night 

TTie twildings themselves are ex 
pensive to maintain and heal, which 
may t« pari of the reason students and 
Irutructors are enpecled lo freeze when 
the winter creeps Into the leaky 
facilillci. whcM safely features have 
dclcrlorated to a slate far below what 
student paying for a good education 
should have to expect. 

Classrooms arc overcrowded and 
Inacccssable to handicapped students, 
and no off-street parking facilities arc 
available 

acarly. if IPFW Is going lo continue 
offering students a fine arts major, or 
even JusI fine aria classes, a new facility 
la going to have to be provided (or them 

The co9l of thefecllily. which would be 



located here on campus, has been 
eatlmated at about H.5 million. And 
presumably almost all o( the money 
would have to come from Ihe state's 
pochetbook 

Now, MS million is, admittedly, a lot 
of money. But the students are not 
asking (or Ihe tiuitding because they 
think It might be kind of nice. They are 
asking out of need and being un- 
believably patient about it al that. 

If students on this campus majonng in 
chemistry or engineering, for example, 
got stuck in a leaky, hazardous and 
substandard building. cnroUmenl would 
dwindle to a point at which IPPW would 
no longer exist. 

Jusi because ihe Tme arts facility of 
this campus is not located where most of 
us have to look al it does not mean it is 
not a shameful reflection on IPFW. Fme 
arts studenL&lt;i have the right to expect 
facilities worthy o( the money they are 
paying and the effort the&gt;' are putting 
forth lo be educated here.

coach Dob Knight really deserve all the 
heat he Is gelling about how he Is han-

summer, nobody would have tried to 
second guess the fiery buBketball gum. 
Now, however, everybody thinks they 
hnvc the answer. Truth Is, nobody can 
know the tendencies and abilities of a 
group ol tiaskctball players belter than 
their coach. Fans don't know how 
players perform in practice, and it Steve 
Alford lor anybody) Is stinking up Ihe

It is interesting that there has been 
very little criticism of Coach Knight's 
tactics by other coaches and players. 
These arc haskellwll people, anddoesn'l 
It seem that if Knight's L "

Seller, "becauie I have my

"The project was funded 
by the National Endowment

1878." Mid BuUer; and they 
comequently received a

tocomplcia the project. 

"We recelkt!d a grant of

"We each had one 
Bemcater " So, In the fall 
temeaier ol 1978. Seller 
dedicated her working houn 
lo the Hegel project, and 
BuUer did Ihe same in the 
Bpnngaemeaier o( 1BJ9 

Seller also received 
another grant to help In

"Thai one • the letter to his

The leilen also revest 
Hegel's relationship with 
ImpcTtanl figures of his era, 
such as Goethe, a famous 
German writer. "There Is a 
whole block of correspon- 
dence with Goethe." aald 
Seller. 

Hegel, who leclured in 
aestheUcs, traveled to 
Belgium, ihe Netherlands 
France Consequently, 



nsearth, b^nslatlng, and 
writing o( commentaries for 
their book, they did receive 
aid from outside sources. 

Mainly, said Seller, "we 
had help from other people

Because of Unning's belp 
with Engllah style, said 
Seller, "the style of the

"James, knowing both 
Eo^isb and German." said 
Seller, "was a fantastic 
help"

and Setter's H^el project,

However, Butler, quick to
