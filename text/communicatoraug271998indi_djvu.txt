Budget burdens campus

In an unprecedented move, a 
meeting by [he Budgelary Affairs 
Subcommiiiee of the IPFW Faculty 
Senate determined that IPFW is 
lacking die finances necessary to 
allow the university to continue to 
grow at the rate that it has been. 

According to subcommittee 
Chair George W. M. Bullion, these 
findings were the result of a series of 
three meetings prior to an Aug. 5 
press conference held in Walb 
Union. 

The committee believes that the „ 
proposed SI million budgetary alio- ^ between the development and

question. 



intent, oversight, ignorance or inef- 
fective representation of the campus 
to the stale officials, the result is the 
same, a university that has never 
quite lived up to its own expecta- 
tions much less the expectations of 
its constituents." 

Recent local media coverage 
has focused on the fact that IPFW 
was ranked eleventh among similar- 
ly-sized universities in the slate of 
Indiana in Per Full-Time Equivalent 
(FTE) Student Operating 
Appropriation during 1996-97 and 
1997-98. 

Projections for 1998-99 show 
IPFW ranked twelfth out of the 
same fourteen universities. 

IPFW's 1998-99 projected FfE 
is less than half that for Indiana 
State, the school at the top of the list. 

IPFW chancellor Michael 
Wanell said that there is a two-year

Legislature is not enough to sustain 
IPFW into the next century. 

According 10 a handout pre-

less than the average for the 14 insti- 
tutions." 

The Indiana Higher Education 
Commission recommended to die 
State Budget Committee on Oct. 16, 
1996. that funding for the 1997-98 
fiscal year "ir adopted would cause 
(1) IPFW's appropriation (based on 
FTE count) ranking to fall another 
two positions to eleventh, (2) 
IPFW's appropriation (based on 
FTE count) to be S6.446.970 bctow 
the average, and (3) IPFW's appro- 
priation (based on student head- 
count) to fail S12. 386,691 below 
the average." 

That Senate document also 
asked that "the Fort Wayne Senate 
receive a report regarding these 
efforts as soon as possible but no

The figures used in the above 
projections were based on 1995-96 
student enrollment, and not the most 
current enrollment figures. 

Wartell also added that die two- 
year lag time does not take into 
effect recent changes in university 
enrollment. 

According to Wartell, schools 
that decrease in enrollment do not

' additional their funding simply because they la 
have lost students. 

Conversely, schools that 
increase in enrollment do not auto- 
matically receive a larger allocation. 

The Budgelary Affairs 
Subcommittee has made efforts 10 
make this situation an immediate 
concent several limes in the past 
two years. 

According to a 1998 chronology 
listing the formal steps taken up to 
the current point, the IPFW Senate 
approved document 96-7. which 
was originated by the Budgetary 
Affairs Subcommittee citing Lantz's 
memorandum and recommending 
"that if the Indiana Commission for 
Higher Education's recommenda- 
tion to the Slate Budget Committee

cluded (hat it 
was necessary 

to lake a route 
outside of the 



expected formal channels in voicing 
their concerns and Findings because 
time necessitated it, according to a 
memo from the committee. 

This memo, dated 
Aug. 5, was sent 10 a list of recipi- 
ents, including Northeast Indiana 

legislators, the IPFW Community for "W? 1 ''^"f 1 ™ 110 ™ f or *?

Senate. 

The memo stated thai under- 
funding of IPFW has been a concern 
for many years, and former 
Chancellor Joanne Lantz "formally 
advanced the case Tor remedying 
IPFW's underfunding in a memo to 
Dr. Steven Beering, President, 
Purdue University, dated May 1, 
1992." 

The memo further stated this: 
"Whether this underfunding was by 



Senate document 96-7 also reit- 
erated Laniz's conclusions that 
"1. Although IPFW (was) sixth in 
FTE... enrollments (in 1991-92), its 
[per FTE) funding (bad) dropped 
from seventh to ninth (position) 
over the (previous) five years. 

2. IPFW's appropriation based on 
FrE count (was) 56,624,016 less 
than the average for the 14 institu- 
tions. 

3. IPFW's appropriation based on 
student headcount (was) S9.576.756 



The chronology shows that 
another aitcmpi was made in March 
through Resolution 97-18. 

This document showed that 
IPFW ranked eleventh in 1997-98 
per FTE Student Operating 
Appropriation. 

The document compared IPFW 
wilh a similar campus, 1UPUI, 
which received S854 (or 22.6 per- 
cent) more per FTE student than 
IPFW in 1997-98. 

This document resolved that 
"The IPFW administration, in coop- 
eration with Purdue University- 
West Lafayette administration, pre- 
sent plans at the April 1998 meeting 
of the Fort Wayne Senate for 
improving IPFW's per FTE operat- 
ing appropriation to at least ihe 
average of its peers... -54,467 as of 
1997-98." 

Bullion said that the subcom- 
mittee chose to go outside the for- 
mal channels that would normally 
have been used because the subcom- 
mittee had been addressing the situ- 
ation for two years and it had yet to 
be rectified. 

Bullion is hesitant to think about 
what the effects of not receiving the 
requested money would be. 

"1 don'i even want to anticipate 
that," he said.

Bomb threat suspect pleads guilty

is not an IPFW student. 

The last academic year saw 
more than 30 bomb threats called 
in to campus. 

Each of the four counts was 
originally a Class D Felony, car- 
rying wilh it a minimum one year 
jail sentence and a S10.000 Fine. 

The four counts against 
Drake were pled down from 
felonies to misdemeanors. 

He received a one-year sen- 
tence for each count. 

The sentences were suspend- 
ed, and Drake instead received 
probation and an unspecified 
amount of community service. 

No restitution to the universi- 
ty was required in this case. 

Former IPFW siudenl 
Marcy Klotz. a suspect airested 
in connection with two bomb 
threats called in to the university 
last fall, pled guilty to Couni 2, 
False Reporting and Informing. 



in May. 

Count 1 against Klotz was 
dismissed. 

Klotz received a one-year 
suspended sentence, one year 
probauon and must pay the uni- 
versity an unspecified amount of 
restitution. 

Since Drake's arrest in April, 
IPFW has had no campus bomb 
threats, ending a siring of can- 
celed classes and building evacu- 
ations thai had plagued the cam- 
pus last academic year. 

Lauren DenHarlog, chief of 
Police and Safety, had high 
praise for ihe work of everyone 
involved in Drake's arrest and 
conviction. 

"It look a lot of teamwork. 
We are proud that we did it twice 
in a row," said DenHarlog- '""" 
important thing is, he was 
victed." 



An All- American City Deserves un All- 
American Public University 

In order for IPFW to be able to con- 
tribute effectively to the economy and 
development of the greater Fort Wayne and 
Northeastern Indiana areas, it must receive 
funding at a level at least equal to other 
state -supported institutions. 

Specifically, additional funding must 
be available to deal with Ihe following: 

1 Staffing of Programs 

Many programs were initialed on cam- 
pus wilh little or no additional resource 
support, notably graduate programs; the 
most recent example is the M.S. degree in 
Applied Computer Science. 

Many new programs have been created 
"on a shoestring." 

2. Full-time Faculty 

We need to replace a significant frac- 
tion (perhaps 50 percent) of part-time fac- 



ulty wilh full-lime faculty. 

This is essential to ensure that accredi- 
tation is maintained in all areas and to make 
more faculty available to assist students 
wilh special projects. 

3. Technology and Instrumentation 

We need to increase funds available for 
the repair, replacement and upgrade of 
technology and scientific instrumentation. 

Equipment lhat was needed for recent 
huildings was noi provided. 

Obsolete equipment must be replaced 
wilh state-of-the-art equipment. We are 
building rich but equipment-poor. 



We need to increase funding for the 
library to put it on a par with fUPUI's. 

Our holdings are nowhere near as 
extensive as they should be, and this may 
have a negative on future accreditation. 

There have been three major communi- 



ty fund-raising efforts on behalf of Ihe 
library, but these have been used for main- 
tenance, not for improvement or endow- 
ment-building. 

5 Teaching Development 

a. Provide funding to enable all faculty to 
go to conferences and workshops to stay 
up-to-date in their respective fields. 

b. Set up a leaching development center at 
IPFW Such a center could be staffed wilh 
expens to assist the faculty in the use of the 
latest of technologies, such as Web sites, 
CD-ROMS, etc. 

As new technologies emerge, a major 
goal of the center would be to shorten the 
time lag between a specific technology 
emergence and its incorporation into Ihe 
classroom or library. 

6. Communication and Outreach 

The many degree and program offer- 
ings at IPFW are generally not well known 
in Ihe regional service area (Northeast 



in many areas, because we are unable to 
compete effectively. 

The average IPFW faculty salary is 
now 510,000 less than whai it is at 1UPUI! 

This was highlighted recently by for- 
mer Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs 
[Fenwick) English, who focused on the dif- 
Tndlana Stale, for example, which ficulty of attracting high-quality adminis-

Indiana). 

Other state institutions funded at a 
much higher per student level advertise 
their offerings extensively in ihe Fori 
Wayne area. 

Yet because our outreach is so limited. 
due to underfunding, local residents are 
unaware of what is available at IPFW. 



adequately, even locally! 

7. Competitive Salaries 

IPFW has fallen behind in salaries 
when compared to similar institutions in 
the country. 

When administrators are not paid at 
adequate levels, the waterfall effect is in 
place. 

Positions are extremely difficult to fill 



"The first priority in this budget pro- 
posal is the quality of the education our stu- 
dents receive. The most important factors 
in maintaining that quality are competitive 
salaries for faculty and providing the tech- 
nology support necessary for a state -of-thc- 
an learning environment." 

Certainly IPFW deserves no less!

Ihe deadlines, and seeing how 
much money we are going 10 have 
to come up with. 

Every fall semester we run into 
the same problem: Is ihe financial 
aid going 10 come through or not? 

Usually, no matter how much 
time we allow for our FAFSA 
forms to go through, il seems as 
though we always have to come up 
with a little cash to hold the classes 
thai we registered for in Ihe spring, 
because fees arc almost always due 
before the Financial Aid check 
shows up. Most of the people who 
rely on financial aid to come 



through usually do noi have the 
extra cash to pay for school and 
then either lose the classes they 
registered for or charge it lo a cred- 
it card if they really want to gradu- 
ate on time. 

We have a two examples to 
show what some students have to 
go through to gel Iheir funding for 
college. 

STUDENT «1 

This spring Student tt] mailed 
his individual FAKSA form along 
wilh his brother's. As of May, both 
schools had not received notice of 
either FAFSA report. At this time, 
Student HI in. nil, I oul his form 
again, and once again, il was not 
received by Ihe address that the 
FAFSA was sent to. In early August 
the student was notified thai his 
classes were to be paid by July 31 
or ihcy would be dropped. Sludcnt 
#1 went into die Financial Aid 
Office lo inquire aboul his form. 
and the Financial Aid Office said 
mat there was nothing for them lo 
do, and that Student SI had to 
reschedule and contacted the bursar 
about the bill. This made Student 
81 very distraught. Student ffl fol- 
lowed the instructions and redid his 
schedule and had lo pay 1/3 of his 
bill for the semester. He once again 
sent oul his FAFSA and received a 
verification form for his FAFSA 
form and sent it out last Monday. 
Student SI is expecting lo lake out 
a loan and will probably receive no 



grants. Estimated lime for the 
arrival of his funding: anoiher 4-6 
weeks. 

STUDENT #2 

Student #2 has a bit different 
situation. Studenl S2 is in her 
fourth year of school year. She hap- 
pened to fail a ■],(•- in the spring, in 
which she appealed the grade upon 
grounds of reasonable academic 
progress. This delayed ihe process- 
ing of her loans and forms. Since 
she is older than Student -"1 and of 
a lower income bracket than 
Studenl SI, Student # 2 is eligible 
for more grants and other types of 
financial aid man Student # 1. She 
hasn't had her FAFSA form go 
through yet, but due to the type of 
her grants she was eligible to pay 
for at least part of her bill and 
retain all of her classes. Estimated 
lime for the rest of her funding n» 
arrive: 4-6 weeks. 

The thing lhai is the most dis- 
heartening about these iwo students 
is that neither of them was able lo 
gel their FAFSA processed in time 
for Ihe beginning of the school year 
and yei Studenl #2 was able to 
retain all of her classes while the 
other had lost all of his classes thai 
he had arranged for in the spring. 

Is all this worth ihe bother? We 
would have to say that it is, due to 
the value of an education 
However, going through all the 
hassles makes things almost 




by Denny She, Editorial Cartoonist 



unbearable sometimes. 

The idea of financial aid is to 
get assistance in matters or funding 
for college. When Studenl #1 went 
to the office to inquire about his 
student aid. he was (old thai there 
was nothing that they could do to 
help him. Those words should not 
be in thai department i vocabulary'. 

The whole purpose of ihe 
Financial Aid Office is to help peo- 



ple; il's like a mentally disturbed 
person going to a psychiatrist and 
the psychiatrist saying that there is 
nothing that he can do lo help the 
patient. It shouldn't happen! 

The hardest thing for these two 
students, like many others, is that 
this is not the first time that they 
have bad problems with their finan- 
cial aid. Things like this happen 
every fall to many students. 



We have 10 admit that it's 
intriguing lhat you can now file 
your FAFSA online, but who really 
trusts the Internet with lhat type of 
information? 

Il's about lime for someone to 
make financial aid easier and less 
frustrating for Ihe recipients to have 
processed. We don't need ulcers ai 
age 21, now do we?. 



Letters to the Editor 



Get Off To A Great Start-In Life- At IPFW 




As the advertising agency responsi- 
ble for IPFW's lag line, "Gel off to a 
great start," I want lo respond lo the 
Communicator's July 30, 1998, cdilor- 
ial. I believe that with a belter under- 
standing of the strategy behind IPFW's 
advertising, students and faculty will 
belter appreciaie the positive impact il 
can have on the school. 

Simply put, the goal of ihe advertis- 
ing in question is to increase under- 
graduate enrollment. Enrollment drives 
funding, and increased funding creales 
greater opportunities for students, fac- 
ulty and the community. 

Unforlunalely, the value of IPFW is 
often underestimated by the communi- 
ty. Extensive interviews with high 
school seniors, IPFW students and 
high school guidance counselors pro- 
vide ample evidence that persons unfa- 
miliar with IPFW often undervalue ihe 
assets it affords. Many students, in 
facl, enroll at IPFW wilh the intention 
of transferring out at some future dale, 
often to Bloomington or Wesi 
Lafayette. The realiiy, however, is 
quite different: there are more students 
transferring into IPFW than transfer- 
ringout. 

The editorial asked: Will students 
find "some hidden El Dorado" at 
IPFW? Apparently, yes. Once on cam- 
pus, Ihey discover that affnrdability 



and convenience combine wilh diverse 
course offerings, talented faculiy, dedi- 
cated administration and the finest 
facilities in the region to provide a 
world class education right here in Fort 
Wayne. Because those students recog- 
nized that it was easier to gel started at 
IPFW than other campuses, those stu- 
dents have gotten off to a great sian — 
in life. 

To suggest that advertising can 
effectively change perceptions of IPFW 
indicates that the editorial's author 
overestimates the school's marketing 
budget, and misunderstands the essen- 
tial purpose of advertising. Advertising 
does not "sell" products, it only 
encourages inquiry or trial. Just as an 
automotive ad encourages a prospec- 
tive buyer to consider a particular car, 
IPFW's ads encourage prospective slu- 
denis to give IPFW a try, i.e., to "get 
started." Once in the dealer's show 
room, it's up to the salesman and a test 
drive to sell the vehicle. Once on cam- 
pus, a prospective studem has to be 
'sold" by the programs and the faculty. 

To carry the automotive analogy 
one step farther, a car becomes a best 
seller because thousands of satisfied 
owners provide testimony for the prod- 
uct The same can be expected for 
IPFW. lis students and alumni are its 
best salespeople. And, as the body of 



successful IPFW alumni in the commu- 
nity grows, misconceptions regarding 
Ihe school will diminish. , . 

Frankly, it's encouraging that stu- 
dents are sufficiently loyal to IPFW 
lhat they are concerned about its public 
image and its advertising. It is exactly 
because of that loyalty and commit- 
meni thai the school's strategy of 
encouraging trial — "Gel off to a great 
start" — should prove successful. 

We're new lo IPFW as iheir adver- 
tising agency, and we're excited about 
Ihe opportunities to help the school 
grow in size and stature. The radio 
commercials in question represented an 
interim campaign, put together quickly 
to stimulate activity for summer ses- 
sions and Fall registration. We hope 
that mosi listeners recognized the 
intended meaning, that by gelling start- 
ed ai IPFW. one was getting a great 
start to life. As a longer-term, more 
encompassing advertising campaign 
unfolds in the future, I expect it will 
become more clear. I hope lhat students 
will come lo embrace ihe advertising, 
and recognize their part in the school's 
success.

State of the World 



Willi aJI of [be talk of President 
Clinlon finally coming clean, lilUe 
else has been paid aiicniion 10 by 
the national media. 

This should be expected, I sup- 
pose, as it was the first time in the 
history of the nation that a President 
was made to confess to cheating on 
bis wife and. just the same, the first 
time that a President totally con- 
fessed in front of a national media 
that he was guilty of such a moral 
crime. 

As hot as that topic was. though. 
oilier news happened in the week 
prior to it that was, in effect, placed 
on a back burner. 

One such slory is the bombing 
of two United States Embassies in 
Kenya and Tanzania. 

Not a lot was revealed to the 
American public, naturally, bul 
what was made public is of great 
significance. 

It was known that two separate 
groups conspired together to coordi- 
nate an offensive against the 
Americans, and that 12 Americans 
were killed out of a total of 263 
dead and countless wounded. 

Nothing linked militant Saudi 
exile Osama Bin Laden to the attack 
at the time, but an intercepted phone 
call by the Pakistani government 
gave (hem their leads as lo who 
should be held responsible. 



After the Pakistani government 
received a confession thai Din 
Laden was behind it. 
CI inton ordered a 
retaliation. 

There was a clear motive 
for Bin Laden lo be angry 
with the United Slates, 

According lo CNN, he 
was trained by the U.S. to 
combai the Soviel Union in 
what would be called by 
some historians "Russia's 
Viet Nam," or the unsuc- 
cessful Soviet invasion of 
Afghanistan. 

After the Soviets were 
beaten hack, the U.S. finan- 
cially turned their backs on 
their operatives in 
Afghanistan, one of which 
was multi-millionaire 
Osama Bin Laden. 

Bin Laden then orga- 
nized a couple of tenons! 
groups, built a training 
facility, and made prepara- 
tions for war against the 
United Stales and everyone 
else lhat stepped on his toes 
over the years. 

'The fact lhat his attack 
against the two U.S. Embassies 
occurred in the middle of a national 
controversy that's lasted all year 
should have little significance on 



President Clinton's counterattack. 
After all. a lot of things have 



"The worst that can 


be said of the most 


powerful is that 


they can take your 


life; but the same 


thing can be said of 


the most weak." 


- Charles Caleb 
Colton 



happened since the whole Monica 

Lewinsky scandal erupted. Winter, 

Spring, and Summer, for example. 

Most people are claiming iliat the 



entire cruise missile strike against 
two facilities in Sudan and 
Afghanistan directly linked to 
Bin Ladcn's organized terrorist 
army was primarily done to draw 
attention from ihe President's 
current controversy, lhat the 
Presidenl was "wagging the dog" 
as the president did in Barry 
Levinson's recent film. 

The tiling most people fail lo 
remember, though, is lhat plans 
for more offensives similar to 
those on August 7 were intcr- 
cepied when the bomb suspects 

rere initially picked up. 

If the terrorists were planning to 
attack again, what else could our 

:ouniry do bul hit them before 
they hit us. 

There are only so many hits you 

an lake before you go down, 
after all. 

It could very well be that if the 
Lewinsky scandal weren't going 
on in Washington that a counter- 
attack wouldn't have been 

issued. 

Just Ihe same, though, one 
mighi consider lhat Bin Laden 
and his organization could have 
been waiting for the opportune 
time to strike, a time when ihe rest 
of the country was too preoccupied 
with their leader's ability lo govern 
the nation. 



by Adam Taylor 
Features Editor 



Perhaps if the Lewinsky thing 

never had happened at all, Bin 
Laden would' ve had to wail for a 
better time to strike, and perhaps if 
Ihe nation weren't so preoccupied 
with what the President did in his 
spare time in ihe Oval Office, tbe 
same would' ve happened. Who's to 
really say? 

The point is, (be President proved 
that he himself wasn't too preoccu- 
pied with ihe controversy at hand 
and ordered a counierstrike against 
Bin Laden. 

In doing so, I feel he showed he 
could focus more on the bigger pic- 
ture, which is more than ihe rest of 
the nation, a task that is essential in 
being at the head of the world's 
most powerful nation. 

Terrorism has grown too fre- 
quent in the world and our 
American president did the right 
thing in showing Bin Laden lhat the 
world isn't going to take it anymore. 

For that, the President should be 
commended. 




Life at 24 fps 




lhat much difference, Either way 
there is a threat against the United 
Stales to keep some fear in the 
hearts of tbe population, and divert 
their attention from a president that 
said he didn't have sexual relations 
with Monica Lewinsky. 

5. The thing that pulled the presi- 
denl through in the film was a weak 
campaign slogan with cheescy 
actors in a poor commercial. 

What will pull Clinion through 
this mess? 

It is yet to be seen, but I bet it 
will be something to see. 

Hopefully, the next lime you 
lake in a good film you will try and 
sec how it actually relates to the 



society that you live in. 

Speaking of "Wag ihe Dog," 1 
just heard recently that the actual 
production of die film was rather 
interesting. 

What 1 actually heard was lhat 
the director or Executive Producer 
of "Wag the Dog" was also the 
director of the film "Sphere." 

It seems that the film "Sphere," 
in which Dustin Hoffman was also 
starring, went into a stall during the 
middle of production due lo some 
sort of technical problems. 

The director comes up with this 
idea that they could probably shoot 
another film while wailing lo get 
back lo "Sphere," so he asks 
Hoffman to go and shoot "Wag the 
Dog" with him. 



1 have believed that art, espe- 
cially film, is the revealing of cer- 
tain truths and a reflection of soci- 
ety and cultures. 

Until this week I had a hard 
time coming up with new examples 
of how film represent life, but I 
just happened to make a connection 
with one certain film with things 
that arc going on with the president 
and our country. 

I know that "Wag the Dog" is a 
political satire, and when it came 
out it raised much attention to the 
facts in the story and how they 
relate to current events. 

It seems thai as of last Monday 
someone rented the film and decid- 
ed lo follow it step for step. 

1. In the film, Ihe president is 
accused of having an inappropriate 
moment with a girl in Ihe Oval 
office. 

Presidenl Clinton admitted to 
having an inappropriate relationship 
with Monica Lewinsky. 

2. Most of the film revolves 
around a group of characters that try 
to cover up the event in the Oval 
Office and save the president's re- 
election campaign. 

They do this by creating a fic- 
tional war. 

Is Clinion trying to tie up the 
airwaves wilh a war, trying lo save 
himself from impeachment? 

3. When 1 watched the memorial 
ceremony for the Americans kilted 
in an embassy bombing in Africa I 
could not help but think of the hero 
that was made of ihe Woody 
Harrelson character in the film. 

The scene was very simitar at 
the air hanger to the arrival of the 
heroes. 

li almost seemed that Clinton 
let a tear roll down his cheek on 
cue. Did this ceremony build up : 
confidence in the president before 
he broke ihe news to the world that 
he had an inappropriate relation- 
ship? 

4. Is there a little too much in 
common between fundamentally 
radical Albanian's that a bringing 
"the bomb" into the United Slates 
and Pakistani fundamentalists that 
threaten some son of "Holy War" in 
retaliation against the United 
States? 

I don't think lhat there is really 



"We must never forget that art 
is not a form of propaganda; 
it is a form of truth."

So, to recap Ihe film, "Wag the 
Dog" was shot during some down- 
time in the middle of production on 
"Sphere." 

The thing dial is really humor- 
ous about this is that "Wag the Dog" 
turned oui to be a much belter film. 

On a final noie, the films that 
are coming out this fall look to be as 
good as some of the film that came 
out during the summer. 



"A Thin Red Line" should be 
one of the belter films for the fall, 
much like "Saving Private Ryan" 
was for the summer. It too is about 
World War II. Be on the lookout for 
a barrage of drama films and a good 
mix of everything from vampires to 
more lawyer films. 

Until we meet again, may your 
movie-going be a pleasant and ful- 
filling experience!

If you were in the vicinity of Sunset 
Reception Hall in the evening hours of 
Aug. 14, you were probably wondering 
wh.n was going on thai could draw so 
many people for such a long 
time. 

If you were, odds are you missed out 
on a greal show. 

On Friday, Aug. 14, a Ska concert was 
put together by local DJs Jim Gater and 
Malt Goshen with the help of area music 
sensation Skavossas and four other bands 
that are quickly developing a following. 

The concert was put on to promote 
Skavossas' new CD "Commotion" as well 
as to capitalize upon the growing interest 
in Ska music within the Fort Wayne 
community. 

The concert was estimated to have 
brought in arounl 550 people all evening 
and lasted fror. 6:3" p,m. until midnight. 
At S5 a person, the crowd certainly got 
their money's worth. 

The concert began with Wickey 
Siickcu taking the stage at 6:30 p.m. 
Wickey Stickets is a local band that is 
quickly becoming very popular with 
methodical appearances in many coffee 
shops and bars in the Fort Wayne 

They were followed by perform; mces 
from Short Millie (from Cincinnati), 
Lickshot (from Bloomington). The 
Articles (from Detroit) and finally, 
Skavossas. I^iich band was given approxi- 
mately 45 minutes a set, giving them plen- 
ty of lime to get the crowd pumped. 

The two men behind the concert Jim 
Gater and Matt Goshen, sajd the lumout 




was pre 1 1 y good for 
what litdc ad' 
ing ihcy did. 

All ages were 
present ai the con- 
cert, which Goshen 
said fn in line with 
what they were 
striving to do. 

"We're just trying 
to do something lo 
help the under 21 
crowd in Fon Wayne 
find something bel- 
ter to do than drugs 
or seeing 
Goshen said. 

Being 17-year- 
old high school siu- 
denis themselves. 
they're quiie famil- 
iar with how hard it 
is lo find something 
to do in die Fon at 
that age. 

After this suc- 
cessful first concert, 
Gater and Goshen 
arc talking aboui 
putting together 
something similar in 
the next couple of 
months. 

Although 
they're slill trying to confirm a date, 
they're hoping that sometime in October 
they will have everything nailed down. 
If you're interested in hearing more 
from Gaier and 
Gdtashcrt, Ihey 
boih have their 
own weekly radio 
shows on Iwo dif- 
ferent stations. 

Jim Gater can 
he heard on 91.1 
WCYT ("The 
Point") from 2:30 
lo 4 p.m. on 
Wednesdays and 
Thursdays where 
he hosts a show

With 80 parks covering over 1800 acres of land, Fori Wayne 
offers premium play space ai an affordable price. Whether plan- 
ning 10 exercise, relax, or mcci up wiih friends, area parks offer 
great atmosphere and space for usually no cost at all. 

"Parks arc quiet places and there are different things to do," 
one Fori Wayne resident said. "People can go there to lake time 
out from the pace of life." 

She and her friends have frequented Foster Park on Sundays 
for years, With accommodations for tennis, basketball, baseball, 
fishing, golf, and picnicking, as well as trails and playgrounds, 
the 243 acre Foster Park is one of the largest Fort Wayne Parks. 
Shoaff Park near IPFW and Franke Park next to the Fort Wayne 
Children's Zoo are similarly equipped, yet with their own diver- 
sities to offer. 




Pholo by Jaiefi Savago. Pfiolo Edior 

While in the park, you might run into these 
guys. Geese at Franke Park 



"Cycle Path and other area cycling stores hold races back 
there (in Franke Park) every year for BMX and mountain bikes 
so 1 do a lot of practicing back in those woods for our races," 
Fort Wayne resident Andy Bender said. I've seen people hiking 
back there and there are horse trails, too. It's used for a pretty 
broad variety of recreation " 

Headwaters Park is one of the many Fort Wayne parks serv- 



ing the dual purpose of park and flood control. It offers 22 
acres of gardens and meadows, as well as the new fountain, 
famous already by area children. Summer festivals and 
concerts arc also held at Headwaters, including the most 
recent Gcrmanfest and Irishfcst. 

On the more unique end. Reservoir Park, off of Clinton 
and Sutlenfield, dates back to 1880, when the land was 
used in attempt to build a reservoir and promote city expan- 
sion towards the south end of Fort Wayne. After years of 
silting without completion, the park was finally finished 
and now houses a large pond bordered by a sidewalk and a 
playground at the base of the mound. 

Following along the St. Joseph and St Mary's river, is 
the Rivcrgreenway, a pathway through Fort Wayne for bik- 
ers and anyone on foot. It runs through many of the area 
parks from Johnny Appleseed near Coliseum, all the way to 
Tillman park on the opposite side of town. 

"The Rivergrcenway is an excellent way to get around 
Fort Wayne." Bender said. "It's a good way to dodge cars 
and a good way to get to see all of Fon Wayne. There are 
lots of historic (Fori Wayne) sights along it," 

The elaborate playground at Lawton Park, next door to 
Science Central, was constructed after area third graders 
contributed drawings and ideas as to what the perfect play- 
ground would be. 

"It's not too crowded and it has long tube slides, bigger 
than those at school playgrounds," Fort Wayne resident Joan 
Tomlinson said. "It seems like it was even made for older kids." 

Over 2500 rose bushes blooming in 150 vari- 
eties can be seen at Lakeside Park. Although 
the park also has tennis courts and fishing ponds, 
the 3.2 total acres of rose gardens give the park 
its fame and also recognition by the American 
Rose Society as one of the top 100 rose gardens in 
the United Slates. 

Even with these larger parks dominating acres 
of Fon Wayne, numerous smaller parks also bold 
importance for their solitude within ihe city. 

"When I go to a park, 1 look for a wooded area, 
but even some of the other parks, like Headwaters, 
are nice because they are so green," Bender said. 
"What I find rewarding with parks is just being 
able to see that the city has provided a kind of nat- 
ural setting and peaceful setting for 
people to relax in." 

Regardless of the size, though, a day in the 
park is easier to achieve in this city. Fort Wayne 
has plenty to offer in way of parks.

Elusive Destiny, Part One. 



An Unclear Destiny 



Features Editor 



Taking lime off from a hec- 
tic life, Michelle swung silent- 
ly on her porch swing at the 
end of a (axing day. 

She had sal through the 
waning moments of the sun 
before the moon gave 11 a much 
deserved rest and was present- 
ly fixated on the orchestra of 
nighi bugs that had gaihercd lo 
perform for her from within the 
confines of ihe woods 

The stars stiincd down 
upon thousands of people that 
Friday nighl but few, she 
believed, needed ihem in their 
lives as much as she did. 

Like hundreds of acupunc- 
lure needles, they alleviated the 
commotion of loneliness that 
enshrouded her mind. 

She wasn't alone in life, but 
she may as well have been. 

Her boyfriend and she 
were at ihe prc-breakup fight- 
ing siagc thai usually signifies 
that they made a poor decision 
in Liking their relationship to a 



higher level by pledging faith- 
fulness to one another. 

He had taken to drinking 
more often with his friends 
than he had spending time with 
her, and something about that 
bothered her. 

Despite how she felt about 
it, she couldn't bring herself to 
leave him. 

After all, it was better than 
being alone. 

Her friends had been 
attempting to fill ber head with 
unprovable propaganda the 
past couple of weeks, trying to 
gel her to leave him. 

They'd put images in her 
mind of him having an affair or 
drinking to forget about his 
obligation to her or being 
afraid of a commitment but 
when it all came down to it 
there was no proof behind what 
they'd suggest. 

They didn't know how he 
thought, and they didn't know 
all that was said when ihey 
were together. 

They didn't know what 
brought them so close nor what 
composed their arguments. 



They were in no real posi- 
tion to advise her on such a del- 
icate matter 

As a matter of fact, their 
advice made her feci even 
more lonely than Ihe situation 
with her boyfriend Aaron, 

Them telling her to spend 
less time with someone she 
already sees very little of 
speaks to her as though they 
don'l care about how miserable 
she feels when she isn't around 
him. 

When she isn't around 
him, she feels as ihough it's her 
fault. 

That's something her 
friends nor anyone else could 
understand: her guilt. 

Bui perhaps her guilt is 
unjustified, just as they said. 

It isn't really her fault thai 
they fight, after all. because if 
it was he'd leave her. 

There are many roles lo 
play in a relationship as well, 
and she feels as ihough she's 
played her part enough. 

If her best isn't good 
enough for him, it isn't her 
fault, just as it isn't his if her 



best isn't good enough. 

That's just the way life cuts 
it sometimes. 

Michelle sighed deeply as 
she looked at her walch. 9:38 
p.m. 

After a good arm stretch, 
she started in lo do some clean- 



ing. 

Just as she started in, 
though, the telephone rang. 

As soon as she said hello, 
she knew who it was. 

Only one person would be 
calling her stammering at thai 
lime of nighl. 

"What do you want, 
Aaron?" Michelle asked with 
an annoyed lone. 

"Umm...I just wanted lo say 
I really love you and I want to 
come over." Aaron replied over 
the music and yelling in the 
background. 

"Really? If you warned to 
come over so bad and you love 
me so much, how come you 
weren't over three hours ago 
when you weren't drunk?" 

"I'm not drunk, Michelle. I 
haven'l even drunk that much." 

"I'm not stupid, Aaron." 



Michelle tanly replied. "You 
know what. I may be better off 
waiting for you to sober up to 
tell you this, but I've been 
doing some diinking tonight 
and I don't think il can wail. 
We're noi a couple anymore, 
Aaron, and I don't think we 
ever will be." 

"Don'l say things like that, 
sweetie," Aaron stammered 
back, attempting to sound con- 
cerned. "You know I love you, 
don't you?" 

"I know you may have 
loved me. bul you don't love 
me anymore. No words you 
could ever say lo me could ever 
overshadow the way you treat 
me. Now if you'll excuse me, I 
have beiier things lo do with 
my lime than 10 wallow over 
what could've been with my 
drunken idiol of an e 
boyfriend. Don't bother calli 
me when you sober up." 

As Michelle hung up the 
phone, she realized something 
She really needed that.

Editor 

Beginning ihe school year is 
depressing enough without having 
to also deal wilh an e-mail system 
that you don't know how to use. 

As iT anticipating your needs, 
the communication department, in 
conjunciion with Computer and 
Data Processing Services, has 
designed Pine E-mail JumpStart 
Short Courses lo help you sort 
through the confusion. 

The classes, which last for one 
hour and fifteen minutes each, list- 
ed at left, are offered at limes con- 
venient for all types of students, 
whether you're a freshman, 
returning adult or a part-time stu- 
dent taking only one class after 
work. 

The classes are offered on a 
first-come, first-served basis, with 
27 seats available in each class. 

All classes will be held in Neff 
B73. 

It is necessary lo bring an 
IBM-formaiicd 3.5" disk or Zip 
disk to the session. 

You can activate your e-mail 
account prior to the class, but are 
welcome to attend the class even 
if you haven't been able to do so. 

You need only have a basic 
familiarity with computers before 



attending this class, so don't be 
intimidated if e-mail is a new 
experience for you. 

According to Sieve Carr, 
assistant professor of communica- 
tion, "For someone who's never 
used e-mail before, this will help 
make it not so intimidating." 

Class attendees will receive a 
booklet with instructions about 
logging onto the holmes Pine sys- 
tem via Macintosh or PC systems 
wilh Windows, as well how to 
compose and send e-mail, read 
and print the mail in your box, for- 
ward and reply to messages, save 
or delete messages in folders and 
change your password. 



These classes are offered to 
any registered 1PFW student. 

Many instructors require thai
