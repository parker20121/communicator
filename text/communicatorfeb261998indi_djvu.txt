Indonesia: 



m 



country 
conflict 



By Dodie Miller 
Chief Reporter 



For many Indiana rcsidenls. and 
IPFW siudenis in particular, ihc 
problems in Indonesia arc merely an 
inlerusling wrinkle in die fabnc of 
miematiooaJ finance 

However, for several IPFW siu- 
dents, the conflicls in Indonesia hit 
home, lilcrally 

The following ik the first of a 
two-pan series exploring the causes 
and effects and possible solutions to 
Ifae crisis in the southeast Asian 
country of Indonesia and how it 
affects students from diat region and 
local companies with fariones in 
Indonesia. 



Politics 



The key to understanding the 
current wave of financial chaos in 
Indonesia is to perform a brief 
analysis of the country's pohtical 
scene and examine who is in power 
and how Uiai individual Ls running 
the country. 

Indonesia's president is a 77- 
year-old man named Suharto. 
(Native Indonesians have only one 
Dame, while Indo-Chmese typically 
have iwQi c.g , a first and a last 

Suharto came to power in 1965 
with the help of the United States 
govenmienl 

This docs not mean that 
Indonesia's current problems are the 
fault of the United Stales. 

Indonesia functions on the sur- 
face as democracy, but beneath die 
surface lies a dictatorship 

This dictatorship is one in 
which rural residents can be forced 
to choose a particular candidate for 
president, although there are ballot 
boxes for three 

Such was the case appntximale- 
ly 5 years ago. when armed soldiers 
coerced rural peasants into voting 
for Subano 




Widi that understanding of the 
country's history, it is no surprise to 
learn that the most bloody demon- 
strations have occurred in the 
Indonesian countryside 

Suhano often does not seem to 
be aware of the problems his coun- 
try is experiencing 

Indonesia docs not have an 
opinion poll where citizens can vote 
on Lheir pleasure or displeasure of 
the current president. 

Suhano has had problems with 
human rights. He was responsible 
for the slaughtering of 114.(XK) peo- 



ple on East Timor, after a demon- 
stration against his presidency 

East Timor is a liny island locat- 
ed soudi of the more than 13,000- 
island Malay archipelago that con- 
tains Indonesia. 

Suhano IS also the leader of a 
country that bums the rain forest. 

The burning of the rain forest 
not only destroys endangered plants 
and animals, but heavily pollutes 
neighbonng Singapore and dimin- 
ishes the earths ability to purify the 
air. 

The U.S. seemingly supports 
Suhano because, "he bstens to us," 



said Gerald Houseman, profes- 
sor of political science 

Houseman is familiar with 

Far Eastern culture, particularly 

that of Indonesia and Malaysia 

While living in Malaysia 

during 1989-90, Houseman 

visited Indonesia In 1993- 

94, he lived in Indonesia 

ind visited the country 

again in 1994 

"I speak die lan- 
guage and know the 
people,-' says 
Houseman. He has 
used his extensive 
knowledge to write 
and speak a great 
deal on the subject of 
Indonesia. 

On the subject of Suhar 
Houseman thinks the aged leader 
could benefit his country by taking 
the advice offered to him and being 
more aware of the situation. 

"We (the US.) helped put bim 
in power. He listens to us-most of 
the umc He has to come to terms 
widi reality," Houseman said 



Indonesia's bleak reality 



Bv DooE Miller 
Chief Reporter 



Emid problems of bad pri- 
vate sector ownership, bad 
government and corrup- 
uon. Indonesia has also had 
to deal with the bad weath- 
er that creates a difficulty in grow- 
ing rice, which is die principal food 
source for much of die population 

Coupled widi diat Ls the 
fact that the rice diat 1; grown costs 
(our times as much as it did before 
the depression, like the cost of other 
food staples 

As a result, some parts of the 
country are experiencing a food 
shortage Indonesians are starting to 
lose confidence m their government. 

There have been seven recent 
demonstrations in four cities 

For Indonesians who make theu- 
living in the unpon/expon business. 
this is an inca-dibly bleak time 

"It means don't buy anything 
from another country." asserts 
Houseman 

The nouceabte collapse of die 
Indonesian currency began about six 
months ago 

The rupiah value plummeted 
because the government decided to 
devalue it in order 10 "defend it 
against odier sunounding countnes 



currency." says Houseman 

Initially diis seemed like a good 
idea because odier Asian markets, 
with the exception of Singapore, are 
also experiencing some form of 
depression, according to Houseinan 

However. Indonesia's problems 
are far worse than die odiers 

Indonesia is worse off than 
some of the other Asian countries 
because it has no policy for how to 
react in times of economic difficul- 

"The elite of Indonesia tend to 
depend on other countnes to bail 
them out," Houseman said 

The devalued rupiah was sup- 
posed to make products cheaper for 
expon The cheaper cxpon products 
seem to come as an advantage only 
to foreign buyers 

For instance, because some 
computer parts are made in 
Indonesia, these product will now 
be cheaper for Americans and odier 
western buyers. 

It is important 10 understand the 
ehtisi view of how to fix the current 
economic hardship 

Indonesia Ls roughly 60 percent 
poor and lower class, with another 
10 to 20 percent cixnprising the 
middle class, and the remainder are 
die most wealdiy. 

The solution that is most 
favored by die elites is the involve- 
ment of the International Monetary 
Fund, 

It is a solution diat will make 
things harder on the poor before 
Uiey sec any improvement. 



History and The IMF 

The Republic of Indonesia is 
located in soudicast Asia and was 
formerly known as the Dutch East 
Indies 

It IS currently the fourth largest 
country in die world, up from I5di 
in 1990 

Colonization by the Dutch 
began in the early 17di century 
Japan conquered the islands in 
1942 

After a struggle for freedom, 
Indonesia was relinquished from 
Japan and declared a republic by 
local nationalists 

Shortly aftcT Indonesia gained 
Its independence. World War II 
ended. 

Western woHd powers met in an 
effon to create a system to help sta- 
bilize the world's economy. 

"Ideally, we'd have one world 
currency, "said Houseman "Europe 
already has the euro." 

The Brctton-Woods agreement 
refers to the area outside of 
Washington, D.C, where the meet- 
ing was held- 

The IMF lends money to coun- 
tries in times of need It is impera- 
tive to stress that it is a loan 

"This is not a hand-out," adds 
Houseman. 

With help from the IMF comes 
the responsibility to follow the orga- 
nization's suggestions 

This is something that 



Indonesia's president does not want 
10 do He does, however, want the 
financial assistance 

One of the provisions that 
Indonesia would have 10 meet in 
order to receive the S42 billion diat 
the IMF is prepared to loan them is 
closing a car company ttiat consis- 
tently loses money, 

"The car company is owned by 
the president's son,'" Houseman 
points out. 

Needless to say, Suhano has not 
closed the company, and the country 
wails for relief 

Houseman states that he typical- 
ly is noi m favor of a country getung 
help from die IMF because it usual- 
ly causes conditions to worsen for 
the poor before they improve. 

However, Houseman says, "I 
support the IMF (resolution) 
because diere are no alternatives to 
it now They don't have a choice '"

Resolutions for the 
problems facing 
Indonesia 



Effective grievance 
procedures 
needed, faculty says 



Bv NoL Beckley 

EWTOR 



Nearly 200 faculty, staff 
and students attended 
Monday's faculty meeting 
to discuss issues of "collcgialily and 
(iecdom of expression" on campus 

The lU faculty board of review 
distnbuted a memorandum concern- 
ing lack of cooperation from die 
administration 

"The hoard regrets that its 
authority and cffons have been chal- 
lenged and Oiwancd by the IPFW 
administration , and that faculty 
who have panicipatcd m the griev- 
ance process overseen by the 1997- 
1998 Indiana University Faculty 
Board of Review have been subject- 
ed to harassment and intimidation." 
the memorandum said, 

Pat Ashton. associate professor 
of sociology and anthropology, said 
there was a need for effective griev- 
ance procedures 

Without It, he said, there is a fear 
of reprisals Iroln die admhiislradon. 

"We as a faculty need to rivet 
our attention on the gnevancc proce- 
dures." Ashton said 

David Theunte. professor of 
computer science, said die adminis- 
tration "actively promotes faculty 
dissension," 

"The faculty have let diemselves 
be turned against each odier," David 
Theunte said, 

Nancy Cothem, associate pro- 
fessor of education, said she has 
never had any difficulty from the 
administration. 

However, she said some of the 
faculty are afraid to speak because 
dieir comments may possibly ^pear 
in a memo 

"We really do have to get along 
if we want to accomplish anything," 



Cothem said. 

Cheryl Trtiesdell. member of the 
n' faculty board of review and assis- 
tant director of the library, urged 
cooperation from the administration 
with the board of review. 

The Purdue faculty board of 
review has not faced resistance like 
the lU board has, said Jeff Wilson, 
professor of psychological sciences. 

Wilson said he was concerned 
about new procedures for handling 
grievances that may "gut the exist- 
ing procedures" for grievances 

He also said the Purdue 
President Steven Bccring had no 
grounds to complain that no IPFW 
faculty has come to him with their 
problems 

Becring has not met with faculty 
concerning grievances, Wilson said. 

"Why should we expect any- 
thing else," Wilson said . 

Mary Helen Theunte. chair and 
professor of English and linguistics, 
defended herself against allegations 
of racism. 

She said these allegations may 
be die reason she has not been reap- 
pointed chair of the English depail- 
ment, despite "neariy unanimous" 
recommendalions for her reappoint- 
ment from people in the English 
department 

The racism allegations, she said, 
were "inappropriate and shameful." 

She also said the administration 
has compiled a "database of racism" 
against her. 

Chnstine Patterson, director of 
multicultural services, said the 
charges of racism "may have been 
blown out of proporliOTi," 

In a tearful speech. David 
Theunte said the stress his wife had 
been under for the last two months 
has been immeasurable 

"If the administration can do 
this to her, they can do it to any of 
us," David Theunte said

CLONING ARTICLE RAISES EYEBROWS 



To the Editor 

In the Feb. 12 edition of your 
paper, 1 read a rather disturbing arti- 
cle dealing with the issue of cloning. 
This article was reminiscent of an 
earlier article written in "The 
Communicator" last spring deatmg 
with the same subjecL Similar to the 
earlier article. 1 felt compelled to 
respond to this one also 

Before 1 begin, let me state that 
I do not bold the position tor the 
cloning of humans 

However, 1 feel very disturbed 
with the unfounded siaiements thai 
appeared in the article. 

First of all. the article stated. 
"Biology doesn't make a family, life 
docs." Well, what is life? In paa life 



IS a biological process and the mak- 
ing of a human life begins with this 
biological process. As a matter of 
fact, biology is a very big pan of 
life. 

So just what is the author trying 
to say? Why Ls it bad to try and bet- 
ter such an integral part of life"* By 
confusing the reader, how can one 
try to convince others of their point? 
Most educated people will realize 
that confusion is no way to try and 
educate or persuade others lo their 
point of view. 1 know that human 
existence deals with much more 
biology, such as one's culture, 
morality, religion and so on. but 
biology is such an integral part of us 
that to say it isn't life is unfounded 
and confusing to the reader. 



In the beginning of the third 
paragraph, the author of the article 
states that cloning cheapens the 
value of life. The reason given for 
this is that children will soon be 
itiade to order However, in the fifth 
paragraph, the author stales that if 
cloning could be used to provide 
organs for transplants, then it would 
be alrighL 

Let's take a good look at this. I 
do not know of anything more 
cheapening to the human race than 
to clone a person just to use his or 
her organs for others Just because a 
person has been cloned from anoth- 
er docs not mean dial be or she is 
still not a person 

If 1 was the one being cloned, I 
think that 1 would rather be a "ready

iag for IFFW's student newspaper. We

made baby" than a storage container 
for spare parts. This is, of course, 
based on my own personal morality 
and may not be Ihe general consen- 
sus. Ihe unportant concept of this is 
that bodi devalue human hfe 1 feel 
dial the author hasn't really thought 
about the morality of using a human 
being for the sole purpose of organ 
donation. 

The Stan of the fifth paragraph 
also states that cloning for no reason 
makes no sense to the author 1 agree 
dial science should serve some pur- 
pose, and hopefully that purpose 
will be to benefit humanity, but I 
don't know of any research in this 
area that doesn't serve a purpose 
The experimentation in itself serves 
the purpose of widening our base of 
knowledge concerning cloning 

It IS understandable that people 
are skeptical about the idea of a 
cloned human. However, an argu- 
ment for the purpose of cloning can 
he made jUst as strongly a.s an argu- 
ment for It having no purpose. The 
audior, as a matter of fact, makes 
this argument later in the paragraph 
by statmg several different reasons 
for cloning These include Ihe 
already mentioned idea of organ 
donation and cures for various dis- 
ease Bul how can wc reach this 
point wiihoui the needed research? 
It appears that the author wants the 
results of cloning research without 
the research itself. 1 cannot stress 
enough how important empirical 
research is to doing proper science 

The author contmues the article 
widi statements relating Hitler's fas- 
cist regime and a compari.son with 
cloning. She states that Hitler tried 
lo create a master race once and 
alludes to the faci that cloning could 
give otheni the technology to do the 
same I want to make a couple of 
poinLs very clear here Fascism is a 
political ideology. That was the cul- 
prit, noi the science of genetics. We 
can't blame science for the actions 
of one person or group Science has 
no morrUity or ethics, it is simply a 
tool that people use and it is these 
people that apply their morals and 
ethics to the use of science 

The very blatant fact that 
nuclear technology ha.s been with us 
for a while shows that humanity can 
sanction and control potentially 
dangerous scientific advances I 
know ibis statement leaves me open 



for rebuttal. The simple fact that the 
world has come close to the use of 
nuclear reprisals and that two 
nuclear devices were used in World 
War 11 illustrates this. But. no one 
can predict the future and banning 
everything potentially dangerous is 
not the answer 

The author bas a particularly 
vague quote which states. "Bul, 
someone, somewhere could still use 
it to hurl people." Following this 
same line of thought, someone, 
somewhere could be using a shav- 
ing ra^or to hurt someone. Docs this 
mean thai we should all stop shav- 
ing? 1 know that this analogy is 
radier sunplislic compared to the 
potential impact of successful 
cloning procedures, but the ideology 
behmd it is the same 

Toward the end of the article I 
read the author states thai cloning 
could lead to more deformities that 
are more devastating. Says who^ 
How? Where is the empincal evi- 
dence for ihis? Did the author read 
thus from some pubhshed source of 
research? If so, then she really 
should have cited her sources. 
Otherwise, this statement becomes 
unfounded and just her opinion. She 
goes on to say that these deformities 
would be worse than what 'we have 
now with just letting nature take its 

1 have been taught that "nature," 
which I am assuming the author 
means natural selection, does not 
necessarily have a course That 
statement sounds more like a theo- 
logical approach lo biology than a 
scientific one. Natural selection, as I 
have been taught, is random in the 
sen.sc that there is no predetermined 
course that it takes. 1 am not an 
expert on Darwinism, but 1 do know 
that one of its key components is 
variation and that variation doesn't 
ncc£ssanly occur on purpose 

So, wc are now locked into a 
contradictory argument This means 
that we shouldn't purposely engi- 
neer people, but instead let nature 
purposely engineer people. 

Well, natural selecuon isn't pur- 
poseful, and according to Darwm 
more variations of species die out 
Uian live. I am not trying to use this 
as an argument for cloning, I am 
simply saying dial cloning research 
might give us a better hatting aver- 
age. 



It IS intnasic in biology for a 
species to try and perpetuate itself. 
So, why shouldn't we improve the 
healdi and well-being of humanity 
so we can better perpetuate our- 
selves 1 know dial 1 would t^ glad 
if cloning lead to the cure of some 
disease I was stricken widi I agree 
with the author that this research 
would be great if it did cure diese 
things, bul we need to do the 
research first to fmd out if it will. 

Along ihese same lines of argu- 
ment, the author writes that. "I 
believe we have illness and birth 
defecLs for a reason. 1 believe these 
kinds of things can make us stronger 
and more altruistic " 1 am knockmg 
the author's morality, but wouldn't 
the worse birth defects potentially 
caused by cloning make us even 
more altruistic? 1 do not advocate 
such a thmg, I am merely confusec( 
because she says that she doesn't- 
want more defects, but that sh&amp;' 
thinks they make us belter people} 
So why not have more? Especially^ 
if we can grow from it? I find be^ 
line of reasoning somewhat illogi-- 
cal -, 

1 want to state very clearly that I 
am not trying to bash anyone for. 
being against the idea of human' 
cloning. 

My persona] morahty is such 
thai I feel human cloning is not nec- 
essarily the prudent thmg to do. But, 
we need to stop trying to ban and 
restrict diose who arc out to do 
good, empirical science Like the 
example used above with nuclear 
science, we can limit the extent of 
research or at least try and keep that 
research in the haitds of responsible' 
and competent scieniisLs. 

[ do not see any reason why sci- 
ence that could potentially help 
humans should be stopped We can- 
not stop all of the bad things that 
happen in the world and we cannoti 
stop all of the bad people from hun- 
ing others - 

We can, however, through com-^ 
mon sense and informed minds^ 
make soundjudgments as to the roltC 
that we, as students, will play in th£ 
future world of scientific research ^

Powers That Be have allowed us to

Robbie's great ai what he does; he's

ular because he makes weddings fun 
events for every person in atten- 
dance, even the kids who never get 
asked to dance 

He doesn't make much money 
at his chosen career, but he seems 
happy. All in all. Robbie is a really, 
really nice guy; he's kind of like 
your average "guy next door" 

At a wedding reception, he 
makes tnends with an impossibly 
sweet new waitress named Julia, 
played by product-of the 80s, Drew 
Barrymore Julia is sad because her 
fiance. Glen, won't commjl to a date 
for them to get married, and she is 
getting very, very impatient. Robbie

practically every person at a recep- 
tion by singing hate songs instead of 
love songs. He gets punched by the 
bride's angry father and ends up 
hiding from the police in a crash 
dumps ter 

He and hts band end up playing 
Bar Mitzvahs for local Jewish fami- 
lies, but pamc when they realize that 
there are only three Jewish (amihes 
in town They are runnmg out of 
occasions that require celebrauons. 

In the meanimie, Julia's jerk-

Julia geL'^ set for the big day She 
enUsts Robbie'^ help m an effort to 
help snap him out of bis Lmda-bal- 
ing phase. Besides, be knows all the 
best caterers and llonsts and can gei 
ber the best deals 

From this point, the movie is 
completely predictable: Robbie dis- 
covers that Glen thoroughly intends 
10 cheat on Julia after their mar- 
riage. Robbie gets mad. and with the 
help of Julia's cousin, realizes that 
he's falling in love with Julia JuUa. 
in turn, reabzes that she's falling for 
Robbie 

Then the complications stan: It 
seems that Linda suddenly wants to 
get back together with Robbie. Julia 
decides lo lell Robbie bow she real- 
ly feels, but sees Linda at Robbie's 
house wearing Robbie's clodies 

An upset Juba then talks Glen 
into rushing off lo Las Vegas for a 
quickie- wedding Robbie realizes 
what has happened and bops a plane 
tor Vegas to stop dieir wedding, 
and... well. I'm sure that you can 
guess the rest with amazing accura- 



nostalgia of the last few years, and 
advance to the great year of 1985 
(Personally, thp last time, I thought 
about 1985 was cither 1985 itself or 
while viewing Back to the Future I,

fied big hair? Big gold chains? Bi- 
levcl haircuts? 

BwahahahabahaballM What were 
we thinking? Actually. 1 like to 
believe that we weren't thiitkjng. 
Feigning ignorance seems much 
kinder than adirutting how stupid 
everything looked 13 years ago. 

Admit It, the fashion trends of 
die SOs sucked us all in and spit us 
all out. We arc obviously none the 
wiser, judgmg by the recent resur- 
gence in 80s-inspired cloihing. Tlie 
80s were all about matenalism, and 
The Wedding Singer picks that 
theme up and throws it in your race, 
and the results will make you laugh 

The movie also has a sound- 
track that will take you Tor a ride in 
the Way-Back Machine. Robbie 
croons tunes like, "You Spin me 
Round (Like a Record)" and 
"Holiday" to his wedding crowds 
Odier songs that pop up are "'99 
Lufiballoons" (does anyone out 
there actually know Ihe words to 
that Jong'), "Der Kommtsar," 
""Video Killed the Radio Star" and 
Jan Hammer's theme to Miami Vice 

The songs add a goofmess to 
this movie's take on the SOs, but 
also give It 3 fun, nostalgic quahty 
As Robbie tells Julia. "'We are living 
in a material world, and I am a 
material girl, , er, boy." 

The movie also has one particu- 
lar scene-siealer: George, a member 
of Robbie's band. George is a dead- 
ringer for Boy George, nght down 
to the frilly shins, lipstick and eye- 
hner He croons "Do You Really 
Want to Hurt Mc?" mulLple limes at 
every reception, stopping the wed- 
ding-goers dead m Uieir tracks as 
they marvel at the androgynous 
Miss Thang on the stage At one 
reception, someone asks, "Is that a 
guy or a girl?" I guess poliiical-cor- 
recmess hadn't evolved yet in 1985. 



Lastly, the movie constantly 
renunds you that it takes place in 
1985 through obvious references. In 
one scene, Linda is wearing 
Robbie's Van Halen T-shirt, and he 
tells her to take it oi\. because she 
might jinx it and make the band 
break up 

In another, JuUa's cousin swears 
that no one will ever be able to solve 
a Rubik's Cube and she tosses it 
aside. A chef in the wed- 
ding-catering scenes 
wears a "RELAX " T- 
shirt. made famous by lAc 
band Frankie Goes to 
Hollywood's song, 
■"Relax," 

One of the best 
scenes in the movie 
occurs when Robbie's 
buddy enters a room 
dressed in a Michael 
Jackson ensemble from 
his Thriller days. You 
know which one I'm 
referring lo — the red 
leather Jacket with all die 
zippers and that infamous 
rhincstone glove, I nearly 
losi my supper when I 
saw that, as did my Uiree 
companions. 

However, the best 
part of this movie has to 
be the car ride home 
afterward. Ii's absolutely hysterical 
to sit throu^ this movie and identi- 
fy yourself within its tacky con- 
fines. 

My fellow movie companions 
and 1 spent the ear nde home 
remembenng which of the clothes 
and hairstyles depicted m the movie 
that we had succumbed to. laughing 
at the goofmess of it all Since the 
four of us ranged in age from 30 to 
22, we had all experienced 1985 dif- 
ferently, but we all remembered it 
vividly. 

There are some inaccuracies in 
the movie that drove my movie 
companions and I crazy, though. In 
one scene, a character yells. "I'm 



watching Dallas^ I think J.R. may 
be dead or something — they shot 
him!" 

Um, I'd just like to point out 
that J.R was shot in 1980. and 
unless you hved under a rock that 
year (or were too young to remem- 
ber), everyone alive knows who 
shot J.R By the way. if you did live 
under a rock and don't know, ii was 
Knsten Shepherd (played by Mary 




Crosby). 

In anodier scene, some dancers 
at a bar are breakdancing. Was thai 
still popular in 1985? My compan- 
ions and I couldn't decide. We also 
diought that the outfits worn by the 
breakdance^^ were outdates. too. 

Inaccuracies and all, The 
Wedding Singer is a fun movie. It 
will make you laugh, snicker and 
maybe even regret past choices in 
jewelry However, the laughter that 
you experience during a viewing of 
diis movie may be you laughing at 
yourself, so be prepared.

On Feb. 15, my mother and I 
decided to go out for dinner Our 
choice of restaurant was the 
"Outback Steakhouse " 

Rumored to be the best steak- 
house in Fon Wayne, we decided to 
give it a try After a 45-minuie wait, 
we were seated m a comforuble 
booth. Although somewhat dimly 
lit, the restaurant has a cozy and 
friendly atmosphere. Australian 
memorabiha covers the walls giv- 
ing the restaurant a "down-under" 
feeling The atmosphere is very 
relaxed. 



Our server greeted us politely 
After returning with our drinks, he 
took our dinner order For an appe- 
tizer, we ordered die Gold Coast 
Coconut Shrimp It consisted of six 
huge breaded shnmp, fned to a 
golden brown and served with a 
marmalade sauce. Although known 
(or lis steaks. I ordered the Alice 
Spnngs Chicken. The chicken had 
mushrooms and bacon on it and 
was covered with Monterey Jack 
cheese. As a side dish. I ordered the 
mixed vegetables, which were cnsp 
and delicious. 

My mother however, bad The 
Outback Special, a 12-ounce sir- 
loin. She had the steak prepared 
medium-well. It was tender and 



gnlled to perfection. 

The steaks at Outback average 
aboutS1699 The steak comes with 
a salad, bread and your choice of 
potato or vegetables. 

If steak is not what you are 
looking for, most of the other din- 
ners cost around S9,99 

1 give Outback four-and-a-half 
stars out of five 1 found the service

were generous and filling. For the 
price, the food was excellent. I 
would recouunend this restaurant to

Indonesia: 

Resolutions to the problems facing 
Indonesia 

Continued from page 1 



Results and 
Resolutions 

The UniietJ Siaies coninbutes 
.ippmximawly 18 pciccni of ihc 
lotal fund in tbe [MF, and since iis 
esublishment in 1947 has not lost 
any money in iL 

The IMF IS diffoeni from Ibc 
World Bank, which is run by ihe 
United Naiions, and whose funds 
are usually allotted for certain pro- 
jects. 

Occasionally, a iroubled coun- 
try can receive help from large 
independent banks, such as Cbase 
Manhattan, but Ibe help is only a 
fraction of what it could have 
received from the IMF, 

Conservatives feci the prob- 
lems Indonesia is experiencing will 
work themselves out 

The current thinking is that an 
IMF loan will lower the standard 
of living for everyone, until the 
loan is paid back. 

Houseman points out that 
Mexico in 1995 was an example of 
an IMF loan that hun the common 
people before it helped them 

"Mexico is fine now, but it was 
tbe people in the villages and fac- 
tories that paid it back, not the 
elites," he said 

Richard Miller is the vice pres- 
ident and branch manager of A.G, 
Edwards and Son. a stock and bond 
broker, in Fon Wayne, 

Miller's position on tbe stale of 
Indonesia's financial affairs is 
rather conservative 

"The adversity is overblown in 
tbe media Sure, in the near term 
there are ramifications, but they 
will work through them," be said. 

If Indonesia will work through 
its problems, it may take time 

The country has expenenced a 
drastic loss of the (ew private sec- 
tor businesses that it has and it still 
has far too much govemmeni- 
owned propeny. 

Indonesia currently suffers 



from heavy foreign debt and sever- 
al bank failures Ils president, who 
plays a large role in the current 
problem, will be vinually unop- 
posed m the upcixning March elec- 
tion. 

There are also corporations 
that cannot pay off their debts (and 
because of the depression do not 
have to) and pnvaie sector loans on 
property that will be difTicult or 
impossible to repay. 

Having been made during 
prosperous tmies, those same loans 
must be repaid in U.S. dollars, 
which few Indonesians have and 
every&lt;Hie wants, says Houseman 

"There were loo many loans on 
propeny," he said 

Recently, Suhano developed a 
plan that he thinks can save his 
country from economic crisis 

He wanLs to tie his currency, 
the rupiah, to the U.S. dollar by 
sellmg a fixed exchange rate and 
saving enough dollars to back the 
rupiab 100 percent. 

The plan is to be prepared to 
change the cuirency to dollars if 
the bidonesian people lost more 
confidence in Ihe rupiah 

U S. officials and the IMF are 
against Suharto's plan. Neither 
thinks that Indonesia has tbe 
resources to implement such a 
plan. 

Will the economic disaster 
ever end (or Indonesia^ According 
to Houseman, things may gel bener 
in another 3 or 5 years, maybe 

"Tbere's no end in sight." be 
said.

WHAT IS 

cocAwe-? 

Cocaine is a drug extracted 
from the leaves of the coca bush, 
which grows tnastly on the eastern 
slopes of the Andcs-mainly in 
Peru, Bolivia and Colombia 

it IS an alkaloid, a member of 
the chemical family that includes 
nicotine, caffeine and morphine. 

Cocaine sold on the streeLs ls 
frequently diluted with unknown 
amounts of similar-looking sub- 
stances, such as cornstarch, talcum 
powder, sugars ot active drugs 
such as amphetamines 

The strength of any supply of 
cocaine varies immensely, ranging 
from 5 percent to 80 percent. 

This uncertainty of purity is one 
of the most dangerous aspecLs of 
cocaine use 

now voe-s 

COCMH^ 
WOKK? 

The sense of stimulation 
received from cocaine is called a 
rush, and probably comes from die 
activation of nerve cells in the 
brain that release a chemical mes- 
senger, or neurotransmitter, called 
dopamine 

[)opamine is associated with 
pleasure and sense of aletDiess, 

Studies reveal that a large pro- 
portion of cocaine users prefer the 
drug to food. sex. family and 
friends. 

Cocame "tricks" the brain into 
feeling it has been supplied with 
pleasure such as food and sex. 

Chronic cocaine use eventually 
leads to a depressed low energy 
state eharacterired by flattened 
lack of interest in »;&gt; 




and lisllcssness. 

This occurs after cocaine has 
saturated the nerve endings and 
chemically blocked the re-uptake 
sites of tbe original dopamine 
cells. 

This dopamine depletion basi- 
cally renders the user now inca- 
pable of feeling pleasure without 
the drug. 

Cocaine is among the most 
"reinforcmg" of all drugs. 

This means that every time the 
drug is taken the user experiences a 
strong compulsion lo take even 
more drugs. 

In humans there is no argument 
that the drug produce a compul- 



sion to take more drugs, and chron- 
ic users experience withdrawal 
symptoms characterized by crav- 
ing, extreme iniiability. fuzzy 
thinking, sluggishness and heavy 
sleeping.

Psychological Changes 

The psychological changes 
caused by cocaine depend upon 
length of use. dosages and peer 
groups. 

In general, these effects may be 
seen as a sense of superior attitude. 
depression, intense anxiety, confu- 



sion, hallucinations, irritability, 
bsUcssncss, poor concentftuon. a 
tendency to lie, withdrawal from 
normal activities, paranoia and 
mental illness indistinguishable 
from schizophrenia. 

Personal and social problems 
from cocaine use are innumerable, 
but often include participation in 
illegal activities to obtain the dnig, 
stealing from friends and family lo 
support the addiction, job and 
career problems due to the high 
cost of the habit, detenorauon of 
personal relationships and involve- 
ment in accidents. 

Physiological Changes 

The principle physiologic 
effects of cocaine ;ire caused by ils 
powerful stimulation of the ner- 
vous system, plus the fact that it 
constricts blood vessels. This 
e.s increased blood pressure, faster 
heartbeat and rise in body temper 
aturc to a fevensh level. 

Cocaine use can lead to a wide 
vancty of physical changes such as 
insomnia, fatigue, cold sweats, 
pale skin color, uncontrolled 
tremors, weight loss, headaches 
reduced sex drive, nausea, vomit- 
mg. dilated pupils and

The men's volleyball leam 
uppctl ii5 record Ihn. Friday wilh a 
five Diaich viciory againsi Midwcsi 
Inlcrcollcgialc Volleyball 
Associaiion (MIVA) opponent 
Mercyhursi College. 

Hccior Solo played very link in 
this match because of the flu, but 
Coach Amie Ball fell ihai "Ricky 
Soler raised his level about three 
notches and played very good." 
Soler had 50 kills in the match 
which is one short of the school 
record held by Soto. 

Javier Escobar and Chris 
Gisslen also played well in the 
match. Escobar had 25 kills and 
Gisslen lied a school record with six 
service aces to go along with his 87 
assist'^ 

Wilh the win IPFW remained 
one game behind MIVA leader Ohio 
State. Even wiih ihe good play, Ball 
wants his leain to consistently raise 
its level of play lo keep winning 
"Our team is still playing very 
ibconsisienl and if the leam could 
raise its game as much as Ricky did 
il would be greal." 

One big game coming up Ls the 
match againsi Ball State "Ball State 
is as big a'i it gels We are both 3-1 
and both of us have lost to Ohio 
Slate so we want ibis game to stay 
right behmd Ohio Stale, " Ball said 

Right now the team lo beat is 
Ohio State because of ihc way they 
are playing. 

IPFW doesn't have to worry 
about making ihe postseason tourna- 
ment in the MIVA. Every team gcLs 
lo play but the top four teams gel lo 
host a first round game, so being one 
of the top four leams is advanta- 
geous to winning the tournament 

After the first round games are 
finished the whole lournameni 
moves to Ball Stale where the wm- 
ner of the conference will be 
crowned 



Winning the conference lille 
will cnsun: the (cam a trip (o the 
Final Four in Hawaii, 

"Tbe champion from the 
MIVA goes 10 Ihe toumamcnl along 
wilh the champions of the 
Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball 
Associaiion (ElVA) and the 
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation 
(MPSF) and one at-large bid." said 
Ball 

This team should have a 
good enough record to make a 
run at the at-large bid, but win- 
ning the conference tide will lake 
allof the worry oui of making the 
FinaJ Four, 

Coach Ball will also be 
reaching a milestone very soon, 
his 300lli caner win at IPFW 

Some coaches would be 
ecstaijc (o win 300 games but 
Ball is more focused on ihis team 
winning games. 

"Winning 300 games just 
means that I am an old man and 
Ihal a lot of kids have come 
through here," said Ball. 

IPFW's next home match is 
on February 27 against Long 
Island Tbe match begins al 7:30 
pm and will be televised on 
Cable Access Channel 6. 

The real test will come on 
Saturday when Ball State comes to 
IPFW The Cardinals are led 
by seniors David Bik and Jason 
Fehr Bik was fourth in tbe MIVA 
last season in hiiting perccniage, and 
Fehr was tlurd in kills per game 

Ball wanLs lo wm ihis match lo 
keep pac£ in the MIVA because Ball 
State will be hosting ibe MIVA 
Toumameni in April

Baseball declares war oe Lions 



By Tony Laux 
Spohts Eimtor 

After six weeks of practice the 
IPFW baseball team ls ready lo play 
It faces nationally ranked North 
Alabama Lions this weekend. 

North Alabama is already off to 
a 6-0 Stan and was picked to repeal 
as the Gulf SouUi Conference cham- 
pions. Tbe Lions are led by Sam 
Lee (2B), Alberto Morales (SS) and 
Brandon Hauck (P), who were all- 
conference players last year Since 
the Lions are off to such a good start 
it should be possible to go in and 
steal a victory that can earn IPFW 
baseball some respect. 

Assistant Coach Todd Linklatcr 
said the team is ready. " If we're not 
prepared we're not doing our job as 
coaches " 

A huge help going into this 
game is the warm weather thai has 
allowed the team to play outside 
over a dozen limes 

'Teams in the north usually 
only get oui a couple of tunes but 
with this weather it has helped us 
get ready for the season." said Head 
Coach Tony Vitiono "Any time that 



you can play on gruss instead of 
inside IS a plus because ii is]ust like 
having a game siiuaiion," 

One question mark when the 
season started was the pitching staff 
but they an: looking bciior "Iliey 
are sliil young and inexperienced 
but they have been coming along 
nicely with their control," said 
Viiiono. 

llie pitching staff will have lo 
grow up quickly this season due lo a 
very lough schedule. The Dons will 
face four teams ttiai are ranked in 
the Top 25, including SIU- 
Edwardsville (#3). Lewis (ffll) and 
Southern Indiana (#21) in the Great 
Lakes Valley Conference 

"Our conference is one of the 
toughest in the nation, if not the 
toughesi," said Vitiono What 
makes this even tougher is thai 
IPFW will have to wm their division 
if they want to make any type of 
postseason loumameni. 

The intrasquad games have 
been a good cxpenence for the 
leam "Intrasquad games drive me 
nuts Smce il is your own team out 
there every time there is a plus there 
is a negative to deal with and the 



type of coach that I am. I will 
always look at tbe negative." said 
Viiiorio "Ihave liked the Offense 
that we have been showmg in our 
games and it should continue when 
we open the season," 

Two players have really stepped 
up since the beginning of practice. 
Sophomore Shawn O'Conncr and 
red-shin freshman Brad Smock 
have both r^sed their game up a 
few notches. 

"Shawn is really showing a lot 
of consistently in his offense and 
defense. "Vuiorio said, "Smock has 
made a very smooth transition from 
catcher lo outfield," 

One player that the team was 
counting on for help won't be mak- 
ing the Inp to North Alabama or the 
next three games Rico Martin has 
been suspended from the team for 
violating team rules 

"Rico rrussed a few practices 
and if you don't practice you don't 
play." said Vittorio "He has been 
really frustrated coimng off of bis 
injury and he missed a couple of 
practices before he realized bow 
much he loved the game."

'The spans page records man'j accomplishmenis... ihe 

from page his failures" 

- Author Vnhiown 



Don't judge U.S. Mens Olympic Hockey Team too harshly 



Dirty Laundry: Tonyi 




The 
Uniicd Slates 
Men's Hockey 
team fell rUi on 
lis face in Japan 
and didn'i win a 
medal So 
what' Has tbe 
world ended? 



Yes, wc 

all expected them to at least make il 
to itic gold mctlal game Of course 
when they were favored to win ihcy 
were "our team" 

Sayings such as "we're going to 
win the gold" and "our team is just 
as good as Canada's" were heard 
frei|ucnily around the nauon 

Bui when the Tinal horn sound- 
ed Ibis bad all changed. No longer 
was this team held in such a high 
regard 

"They arc overrated" and "an 
eniharrassmeni to the countiy" and 
'how could they lose" were phrases 
thrown around as much as fire 
CKiinguisheis out hotel windows 

A minor earthquake bit dunng 
(he games but I am not sure thai it 
was a natural quake. It was proba- 
bly all the fans in America jumpmg 
oft of the "bandwagon" of this 

I haven't seen so many people 
deserting ship since I saw that damn 
Titanic cotnmerdal again. 

So what killed this team? 

Was il the different size of the 
nnk? No. this may bave been a lit- 
tle unfamiliar for them but chances 
are if I added some space to a bas- 
ketball court you probably would- 
n't notice it 

Was il the partying until four in 
the morning? No. not all of the 
players were out and do we really 



think thai all of these guys are home 
in bed by nine o'clock on an off- 
day and home 20 minutes after a 
game. 

So what killed this team' 

It waslhe HYPEI There hasn't 
been this much hype for a team 
since the Arst Dream Team that 
played basketball at the Olympics 

The way that hockey analysu 
were talking and writing stones wc 
didn'i need any preliminary games 
Wc should just put Canada and the 
U S. on the ice. have the game and 
award ihc gold medal to the wuiner 

Sure it's gixtd to be confident, 
which I am sure that they were, but 
they probably felt ibeu^ only com- 
peuiion was Team Canada 

The other teams were probably 
considered a bunch of players who 
couldn't make it m the NHL 

Granted [he HYPE didn't play 
the game but then again neither did 
Team USA. They didn't "want it" 
bad enough and il showed m every 
aspect of their game 

From the losing and the way 
they handled losing in iheir 
postgame "celebrailon" 

When the reports of what hap- 
pened at ibe Olympic Village first 
came across die papers people said 
how "childish and embarrassing the 
behavior was " But was it? 

Aren't we the same people who 
go to a hockey game and get pissed 
if Uiere aren't any fights' ll's noi 
like these guys were up for a bunch 
of bumanlULTian awards anyway. 

They skate around with sticks 
and hit each other for a job They 
gel paid to be violent and it is jusi 
sad that we judge them so hard. 

Give'em a break, it's not like 
they went oul and murdered their 
ex-wife. did they ^
