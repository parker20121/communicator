Opinion 



The Communicator 



Speakers could dispell 
region's misconceptions 



Student bodv president Tin 
Smith, at a recent Student's Gov 
ernment meeting, brought up th&lt; 
idea of starting a lecture sent--, us 
ing faculty and 



imiiL' 



; to the Fort 
Wayne community as a way of 
creating more inte'resl and support 
toward the university from the city. 
The idea is not a new one but 
certainly is a good one. IPFW has 
administrative personnel and in- 
structors wiUi expertise that ranges 
from accounting to urban studu -s 
and everything in between. To offer 
these experts as speakers to busi- 
nesses, groups, clubs and schools 



pus and the city This is an area 
that has been sadly lacking in the 

Lack of involvement and the 
negative image the citv of Fort 
Wayne has of IPFW is /ghost thai 
has haunted Ihe campus since the 
day the doors to Kettler Hall 
opened 25 years ago. IPFW i&gt;. still 
seen by a large part of the Fort 

Wavne c unruly as a "glorified 

high school," not a real umvr-ak 
The term "Bypass High," is still 



campus and the city: 

"There is a great unrealized 
potential for creative interaction 
between IPFW and the greater 
Fort Wayne community," 

Community members felt gener- 
ally not well acquainted with the 
experience and qualifications of the 
faculty and administration. 
' stronger participation

IPFW i 



t.vl.ianit offered to alleviate the 
afore mentioned problem was en- 

haik'iiiL' social service project de- 
velopment jointly between com- 

nilv eioiips and campus groups. 

What better way to present to the 
local community and the surround- 
ing area what IPFW has to offer as 
;i university and once and for all 



The impressions that 
Mi-n.HHAiiK.iis and groups would get 

from these speakers could easily 
have a ripple effect that would 
benefit both IPFW and the Fort 



Interim Chancellor Joanne Lantz Wayn 



umversilv 



a Fort Wayne resident that may 
sum up the citv's over. ill negative 
view of IPFW. The person asked of 
Lantz, "Are vou ever going to be 
able to give any degrees out 
there?" 

Two studies recently done on 
IPFW. Coopers &amp; Lybrand and the 
Fort Wayne Futures study, both

tween die university and the citv of 
Fort Wayne was needed The stud

study also said

efit IPFW graduates. Members of 
the business community would 
meet members of IPFW 
these speaking engagements, 
what the university has to offer in a 
particular field and use that 
knowledge- to draw upon future 
li'KW gi ..dilates as employees. 

This idea could be taken a 
further and businesses and organi- 
zations could call upon IPFW fac 
ulty and staff for use ii 
and survey-type projects 

Speaking engagt ' 
bers of the IPFV 
and faculty staff may no 
public opinion overnight 
could be the key 
door to increased involvement be- 
tween the university and Fort 
Wavne and improves the image ol 
IPFW in the community.

This is the time of year when 
students and faculty begin to fight 

IPFW Many students' feel that 
faculty have the upper hand. 

year when students and lacultv 
fight about parking is that the ar-

the Walb Memorial Union and
