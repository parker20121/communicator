Clinic bombings 
threaten women 



In at] Ihe lime ittc abortion con- 
IroveTBy has been raging, pro lifer* have 
probably never been as close to (Inally 
convincing people a human child, when 
conceived. Is JusI thai — human. 

But now a few radicals among the 
rank* have given up the Ideals of human 
dignity and rallonalily. and their actions 
have coat Ihe prolile moivennent one of 
ti* most valuable assets — ihe belief all 
human life In valuable, or potentially 
valuable, and a }hing not to be denied a 
person by another human belnK. 

Andso. with this high purpoM In mind. 
a few misguided souls ran oui and 
ilarled bombing abortion clinics? Wc 
highly doubt it. These people are people 
who, like so many of us, arc growing 
weary of argument while tliousands of 
feltue* icmbryo«. babic*, lllUe people — 
call them what you will! are lom limb 
from limb Inside their mother's womb 
every day. 

The cllnlc-bomben seem to liave 
given up Iheir morality in favor o( 
violence, and thus put themselves on Ihe 
level of the very ones they oppose, those 
who unthinkingly end the life of a child 
without really knowing whether II is 
human or not. 

Dul the fact Is, thereare not many pro- 
lifers who condone the violent acts. 
People whoabhor abortion doso because 
' they see the legalized murder of children 
going on. They do not fight abortion to 
make (hechlld'ti mother suffer. And yet 
abort ionlsla would like people to Ihlnk 
(ho pro-life movement in no more than a 
cruel way to torture poor women who 
accidentally get pregnant. 



Well, if anything is going to throw 
the shoulders of abortionists the bloody 
cloak o( the martyr, it's gouig to be the 
threat of being blown up for committing 
an act which. If not moral, is certainly 
legal. 

Proponents of at&gt;ortion have long tried 
to de-emotionaliie the issue — to gel the 
focus off Ifie condemned felus and on to 
the supposedly more rational issued Ihe 
plight of the poor young pregnant 

Now few stupid people, who claim to 
be pro-life, have created a pleasing 
siluallon for the abortionists Nol only 
have they taken the Focus off (he ui- 
nocent child, they have brought real 
emotion lo the issue— this time in favor 
of the abortionists — by threatening the 
lives ol the women who arc having 
abortions. 

This is no way to convince women pro- 
life is really on their side. 

To those whoare in favor of permitting 
a woman to abort her child: We are 
concerned (or her safely as well. Please 
do nol think there are many of us so 
unfeeling and baleful as lo pul her life In 
Jeopardy 

To all the pro-life people whose 
struggle has been dealt an unfair blow 
by the bombings^ Keep hoping, praying 
and fighting for those who cannot fighl 
for themselves. 

And, lastly, to (hose who lielieve Ihe 
bomb threats liave helped the struggle 
for the rlghl to life: "He who lives by the 
sword, will die by the sword." (And his 
cause along with him).

Critique writer Siebert lacks a critic's 
eye, says movie review reader 



■alongwl 




To Ihe Editor: 

I have a question tor 
Entertainment Editor, 
MIchele Shaffer: Why Is 
Dave Siebert writing film 
reviews? Surpassing the 

-"'ne reply ol "He's the 

ne who will write 
1," 1 would simply 
like to know why a person 
who appsrentiy knows Utile 
or niMhing about the filmic 
medium iswTitlngcrlUques. 

Perhaps "critique" Is too 
word, for Siebert 

. throjgh hit «Tibng, 
to t&gt;e somewhat awestruck 
by the experience of film. 
This docs not make for a 
good reviewer. 

Taking his tales; article oa 
"A Passage to India" as in 
example: I found the aecood' 
grade reading level of this 
piece lo be insulting. How 



often must the title of a film 
be bored into Ihe reader's 
head? 1 feel thatseven times 
in nine paragraphs Is more 
than enough. The ilnicture 
of sentences, Ihe repetltloa 
of sentences and the coo- 
slstenl confusion if the 
tiailcs of plot and story was 
annoying In the exlreme. 

Sleberl Ignores the fact 
ihal David Lean Is a 
pouerful director who has lo 
his credit such Academy 
Award winners as "Bridge 
On the Rirer Kwal." 
"Doclor Zhlvago." 
"LttwTence of Arabia" and 
"Ryan's Daughter." In his 
Tinal paragraph. Siebert 
proves how lilUealtendoo he 
piys to the screen when b« 
dies "Lean's camera work" 
as "also wonderful by 
making every shot per- 
fect..'' 



Letter 



Lean worked with Ernest 
Day c&lt; Ibe British Society of 
Cinema lographera, and it 
was Day who brojghl E.M. 
Forsler's novel "A Passage 
to India" Into full majesty oo 

cidentally, was camera 
operator on "Ryan's 
Daughter" also 

It Is unfortunate Ibairilnu 
of Ihe caliber of "Passage" 
are traralated into infantile 
blurt&gt;s such as "the sup- 
porUng cast was equally as 
good wltb the English never 
looking more stul^. aod the 
Indians never looking more 
Eastern." 

What is equaUy uo- 
fortunate Is that the edltcr d 



this area does not pul a halt 
to repetitive sentencing and 
awkward form Overall, I 
feel thai If there are lo be 
' film reviews in Ihis campus 
paper, then they shojld be 
written on an intelligent 
level, nol insultingly low- 
brows and Ihe editor jlmuld 
eiercise mere reipORSibllity 
in choosing what is con- 
tained within the review. 

Writing for a paper of any 
type should be aa 
professional and thorcugh as 
writing for anything else. 11
