Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne 




New IPFW deans promise 
bright future for campus 



KPC Publishing airbrushed what they initially felt was 
inappropriate nudity in the Oct. 29 issue of The 
Communicator. The owner of KPC has since apologized for 
the decision, but contends The Communicator approved 
the changes. 

Violation of 
Standards? 



|Editor s Note| 

Some days, it's all about the 

In the Oct. 29 edition of The 
Communicator, two photographs 
on the Arts &amp; Entertainment sec- 
tion were airbrushed by 
Kendall ville Publishing Company 
after the newspaper was sent to be 
printed there. 

Kendallville officials called 
The Communicator and said print- 
ing the two photographs — which 
featured nude women - was out of 
the bounds of their standards. 

The violating pictures are a 
part of the Visual Arts Building's 
main gallery by artist John Eric 
Hawkins titled "Figure, Form and 
Figure." They are to be displayed 
through Nov. 7. Hawkins' book 
"The Ancient Shape of Man" con- 
tains poetry by Shari Messenger of 
the IPFW Department of English 



.ind Linguistics. 

When A &amp; E editor Andrew 
Welfle broached the subject of 
including the photographs, it did- 
n't seem like a major concern. It 
was an inside page of artistic pho- 
tographs ~ and to show pictures 
minus the nudity would be false 
advertising and a slap in the face of 
the artist's true intentions, in my 
opinion. 

Ultimately, the decision was 
made that the photographs were 
not in bad taste and they should 
run as intended. 

KPC balked, however, citing 
their own community standards. 

KPC, being a privately-owned 
company, fully has the right not to 
print what they deem inappropri- 
ate. However, it put The 
Communicator in a bind since the 
option of reworking the page 
would have made the newspaper 
late, and would have completely 
made us kowtow to a fear of nip-

On Oct. 30, three new deans 
introduced to the public in 
the Walb Student Union. 

IPFW Chancellor Michael 
Wartell began the press conference 
by speaking of the changing f.ice of 
the university. He mentioned the 
Willis Family Bridge and the stu- 
dent housing project being the 
apparent changes, then spoke of 
internal differences that are taking 
IPFW in the right direction. 

"We have some very talented 
people, three new deans, to add to 
our already existing talented pool 
of personnel," Wartell said. 

Barry Kanpol was the first of 
the three to address the audience. 
He began by speaking of his past. 
Ironically, the new Dean of 
Education was a high school 
dropout. 

Born in Melbourne, Australia, 
Kanpol became a professional foot- 
ball player shortly after dropping 
out. The lessons learned on the 
field still apply, he said. 

'The words of my coach still 
ring loudly in my ears today: 
'Kanpol, you [must) think, eat, and 
sleep football to be successful.' 
That has been my motto in any- 



thing I do," he joked. 

After playing football, Kanpol 
immigrated first to Israel, and then 
to the United States about 20 years 
ago. After arriving, K.inpol began 
his studies at Ohio State University 
Although his new position at IPFW 
has him labeled as a Boilermaker 
and a Hoosier, Kanpol let it be 
known that he will never stray 
from his alma mater. 

"My doctorate is from The 
Ohio State University, in 
Columbus, Ohio. I am a Buckeye." 
After a few laughs, Kanpol 
switched gears and spoke of his 
new role on campus and his warm- 
ing to Fort Wayne and what it has 
to offer. 

"To come to Fort Wayne, a 
friendly and affordable city, has 
made this decision an easy one. 
There is a strong administration 
above me that has made my transi- 
tion to IPFW professionally 
rewarding, as well as exciting." 

Kanpol was very specific 
when it came to his goals as the 
new Dean of Education. 

"My goal as dean is simple. To 
support our strong undergraduate 
teacher preparation program, to 
build on our graduate programs in 



Counseling 

Education, 
and Literacy 

Education. My 
dream is to 
implement a doc- 
torate degree at 
some point in the 
future. All of the 
above can be sup- 
ported by very 
strong teaching,

Indiana legislators called 
'real heroes' for university 



The "spectacular" amount of 
state funding brought back to 
IPFW last year gave reason for 
thanks at the fifth annual state leg- 
islative issues luncheon. On 
Wednesday, Oct. 29, students, 
alumni and staff of IPFW professed 
their gratitude to the stale legisla- 
tors in attendance. 

"You're real heroes as far as 
I'm concerned," commented IPFW 
Chancellor Michael Wartell. 
Wartell characterized the funding 
as "spectacular." 

Several state legislators were 
in attendance at the event; each 
representative was recognized and

week, IPFW is preparing for 



IPFW's weeklong campus 
party kicks off on Nov. 17. 

One of the activities planned 
for the week is a Spirit Sheet con-

encouraged to decorate sheets to 
show their school spirit. 

"Student organizations will be 
able to decorate and win $100 from 
the Student Senate for that organi- 
zation," said Erin McConaha, Vice 



New this year, the king and 
queen will each receive a $100 gift

Amendment I 

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, 
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of 
speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to 
assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. 



Editorial 

First Amendment, second place 

Recently, The Communicator dealt with a very real, very relevant issue present in the 
world today - The First Amendment, more specifically, the part of the amendment that deals 
with freedom of the press. Ironically enough, page 2 of The Communicator lists the amend- 
ment verbatim: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or pro- 
hibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the 
right of the people peaceable to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of 
grievances. 

In the Arts and Entertainment section of the Oct. 29 issue of the paper, there was a 
feature photo displaying the work of John Eric Hawkins in the Visual Arts Building. The 
photos were black and white nude female figures. Of course they were in good taste — other- 
wise the Visual Arts Department would never allow them to be displayed in the first place. 

The Kendallville Publishing Company, home of the Kendallville News-Sun, the 
Auburn Evening Star, the Angola Herald-Republican, among other newspapers, is also The 
Communicator's printer. Once last week's issue went to print, the neios office received a 
phone call — apparently the nude photos were a "violation of community standards" and 
were refused by KPC to go to print. 

Yes, it is understandable if they refused to print it for their own community. But this 
is a publication dedicated to a college campus. Moreover, that campus is 40 miles away from 
their community. How will that hurt them? 

Artistic nudity is not pornography. There is a difference between two leather-clad 
women spanking each other and a celebration of the human form depicted in a photograph. 
KPC is a business based in the craft of journalism. Surely it should hold some respect for the 
First Amendment, an almost sacred mantra to any journalist worth his or her reporter's pad. 
There would be two ways to remove the offending feature of the photos (dare we say it? we 
dare: nipples). One may airbrush out the areola (or dark spot of the chest) or enlarge the 
photo and crop it. When reproducing an artist's work, one should never manipulate the 
reproduction without permission of the artist. Airbrushing will do this. So to add insult to, 
well, more insult, KPC airbrushed out the areola (against the express wishes of the editorial 
staff of The Communicator to enlarge/crop the photo). 

What would this country be without the First Amendment? Nazi Germany has been 
used in this metaphor many times, past the point of cliche, but it remains valid. No right of 
assembly, no rights to hold the government accountable in the press, and no rights to peti- 
tion the government when it is being naughty. 

Unfortunately, The Communicator fell prey to those in control. 

Contrary to popular belief, even/ single person in the world is naked underneath his 
or her clothing. Despite a very few genetic flukes, humanity does not look like Barbie and 
Ken when in a state of undress. Unfortunately, the model in John Hawkins' photo now looks 
like a Barbie doll. 

Is she prepared to live with that? 

We think not. 



Column: By Deborah Dambra 

Mr, Sievers' Opus 

Bight years ago, I began taking classes at IPFW. I liad never bee) 
\lege before and had to go through testing for placement. I wa: 
required to take what I called a "remedial writing" class becaust 
my writing skills were scored at an inappropriate level for collegt 
admission. S know I'm dating myself here, bit! when I went to ele- 
mentary school we were taught the "three Rs: reading, 'riting and 
rithmetic." We were force fed facts to regurgitate on periodic 
tests. Darwin Sievers was my first instructor at IPFW and he 
%ed my thinking process forever with his Principles of 
Composition class. 

Mr. Sievers said that education is meant to teach it. 
vival skills." 1 thought my preinous classes ivere tests of 
rization skills, nothing more. If you remembered enough, you 
received a higher score and then you could forget it. Tests 
composed of true or false, multiple choice, minimal fill-ins and no 
essay answers required. My "survival " was taking the test and the 
application of the knowledge learned was not used in my daily life 

I received a copy of Bloom's Taxonomy of Learning in th 
class that indicated the steps to "true learning" were more comple: 
than 1 ever believed. The steps were: knowledge, comprehension 
application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation. Each step must h 
taken in order to achieve fully a marten/ of the subject. My head 
spinning! '"•'• 

"You are taught to think for yourself," according to Mr 
ers. In 1995, that was a new idea to me. Years of education 
liad taught me to "conform" to each class, each teacher and each 
school. The seed tuas planted then that there may be freedom in 
learning, and that newfound "freedom" has opened my mind tip to 
many subjects I would have never approached prior to this revela- 
tion. 

I liave never 'worked so hard or so thoroughly in my life to 
put together a writing for this class. 1 had to be very specific with 
my thesis. Each paragraph has a point to befolloived loith at least 

■her sentence or hoo to support the main idea. Until this 
1 shake whenever 1 see an index card because each card in that class 
had to have a quote, a source, a common thread to whatever you 
writing in your paper. Tlie cards were then placed in order 
by subject, reviewed and utilized or discarded. Mr. Sievers showed 
class how to spread cards out on the floor to begin this proce- 
dure. Imagine getting doxon on all fours to put your thoughts in 
order for your paper. 

The years have passed, my name has changed, but I still 
remember this teacher fondly. During my years at IPFW, I liave 
experienced many professors, instructors and community leaders 
have taught me various subjects. Only a handful made a last- 
ing impression on me and you were the "first, " Mr. Sievers. 1 Imve 
resold most of my books and thrown out my past tests, but I still 
have my copy of "Bloom's steps" and my rubberbanded index 
cards in order by subjects in my possession. Thank you for ignit- 
ing my thought process and helping me learn in new ways. 

Your former student, Deborah Christie.

that he was not the football player 
of the three newcomers, as many 
speculated. 

"I have a musical history. 
Growing up the Washington, D.C 
area, I earned money during the 
summer playing jazz piano in 
clubs, which was possible because 
back then the drinking age was 
only eighteen." 

When he went to study .it the 
local university, his goals began to 
differ. 

"Like many young people, my 
interests began to change over 
time. I think that perfectly natural 
(when going to school), to change 
interests after Liking ,i multiplicity 
of classes that make you realize 
there are all kinds things out there 
in this big world for you to do." 

Hancock has been to five insti- 
tutions in over 20 years, and what 
he finds exciting about coming to 
IPFW is "it was making a concerted 
effort to serve their region." 

Hancock was also pleased at 
the economical development and 
quality of education available at 
IFPW. In contrast with the other 
universities he has been with, 
IPFW is making an attempt to be a 
"partner with the region by taking 
what we do and giving it to the cit- 
izens of northeast Indiana." 

He was pleased to find that 
upon arriving at IPFW and com- 
pleting an interview, the school 
was, in fact, "walking the walk, and 
not just talking the talk." 

Hancock then addressed his 
new role as Dean of Public and 
Enviromental Affairs, something 
that began as "a service some 25, 30 



ew Deans at IPF 

from Page One 

years ago. Today we still try to 

uphold that tradition." 

He then gave the example of 
the Community Research Institute, 
which Hancock said is "committed 
to broadening civic engagement 
activities and applied research, cre- 
ating partnerships with govern- 
ment agencies, not for profit organ- 
izations, and other public enti- 
ties. ..the DPEA provides the 
knowledge base and skills for our 
students to make tremendous con- 
tributions as public servants. We 
want the public, not only in Allen 
County but in northeast Indiana, to

physics major, the science \ 
abstract, very theoretical, 
goal might be reached in 50 years, 
but I wanled to help people imme- 
diately and continually. So I got my 
doctorate in engineering." 

To explain why he is at IPFW, 
Volaiul told an anecdote about the 



pla, 



know that ■ 



hers 



Last was Gerard Voland, 
introduced by Hancock as "my 
'almost anthropologist' colleague." 
Voland, the new dean of 
Engineering Technology and 
Computer Science, first explained 
that while first attending college, 
his heart was set on becoming an 
anthropologist. 

"I was determined to become 
an anthropologist. It was my call- 
ing, my interest, my dream." 

But after taking a few classes 
in the field, he realized he wasn't 
doing as well as lie should. 

"I was struggling, and getting 
C's, whereas my friends were acing 
their anthropology classes. I then 
realized maybe it wasn't for me." 
While not doing so well in those 
classes, Voland become aware he 
was doing particularly well in his 
physics classes. So he switched 
majors for a few years before 
switching again to engineering. 

"No offense to my physics col- 



has a seed 
of a mustard seed. 
You plant it, water it, and a year 
goes by, and nothing sprouts. 
Another year goes by, nothing. 
And another year and another 
year. Five years pass until the 
moso plant begins to grow. And 
when it does finally sprout, it 
grows 2 1/2 feet every day for five 
weeks, until it reaches its final 
height of 90 feet." 

This method of planting a 
strong foundation rooted with 
patience is the approach Voland 
will take to his new position as 
dean. He emphasized the impor- 
tance of teamwork and project 
management that can be taught 
through ETCS and OLS. 

"Lectures allow students to 
familiarize themselves with the 
materials; but applications allow 
students to master the material." 

Vice Chancellor for Academic 
Affairs Susan Hannah closed the 
conference by answering questions 
from the audience. When asked 
how IPFW got to the point of need- 
ing three new deans, she said it 

"One retired, another's inter- 
im ended, and another went back 
to teaching," Hannah said.

tion, which in part went to the con- 
struction of the bridge, aptly 
named The Willis Family Bridge. 
The money donated was equally 
split between scholarships, endow- 
ment for the Chair in 
Entrepreneurship in the School of 
Business and Management 
Services and unrestricted funds. 

Also given recognition is lone 
Auer. Auer has given a quarter of 
a million in scholarship money

Edit 



Speaking with &lt;i KPC worker, 
I decided the best bet to remedy the 
problem would be to have the pic- 
tures enlarged and re-cropped 
through Photoshop. This is journal- 
ist-geek talk. Translated, it means 
the photos would be made larger, 
and the offending body parts could 
be moved out of the view of the 
image area. This way, the artist's 
picture wouldn't be distorted — 
and nudity wouldn't be visible. 

The main photograph of a 
woman with her body stretched 
against a stone wall was the most 
obvious image of nudity. This was 
the one I felt caused the majority of 
heartburn. A KPC worker told me 
it could be airbrushed out, and I 
responded the last thing 1 wanted 
was for the photograph altered. 
Enlarge and re-crop, I stressed. 

When The Communicator 
arrived Wednesday, it wasn't 
enlarged. It was airbrushed. KPC 
contends it was a misunderstand- 
ing. Misunderstandings happen, 
and KPC has been a great benefit to 
The Communicator this year, but it 
made the newspaper look wishy- 
washy in our own decisions. 

For clarification, we were 
going to run nudity. It wasn't a big 
deal to us. We're not out to be 
Hugh Hefner or Larry Flynt, but 
we were out to be true to John Eric 
Hawkins images. 

Lots of arguments can be 
made on both sides of the coin. 
KPC feels they might have saved 
us heartache by any controversy 
nudity might have caused us. We 
contend our editorial decisions 



or's Note on nu 

from Page One 

should result in our damnation, 
celebration or the non-opinion by 
IPFW students. KPC also noted 
that — while the papers are distrib- 
uted on the IPFW campus - it vio- 
lated their standards because the 
printer's workers would be 
exposed to the nudity. 

Their decision to alter the 
photographs was a bad one. If it's a 
mi -.understanding, then both 
myself and KPC are at fault for not 
clarifying what should be done. 

Officially, KPC is a private 
company and they can't violate the 
Constitution's First Amendment. 
(Only a government agency can do 
so. If IPFW ordered the pictures 
blurred, then we would have a rea- 
son to bitch like dying roadkill). 

But KPC did tamper with our 
freedom of the press — to publish 
what we felt was appropriate for 
our readers; and Hawkins' freedom 
ol expression -- to showcase his art 
in his mindset. On Monday, KPC 
chief executive officer Terry 
Housholder called The 

Communicator to discuss the situa- 
tion. He released a statement. 

"Kendallville Publishing Co. 
has a long-standing policy not to 
print full-frontal nudity photos in 
our own publications and in publi- 

Knowirtg this policy, our produc- 
tion staff properly questioned the 
taste of printing such photos in The 
Communicator. When the editor 
was contacted, we received verbal 
approval from him to alter the pho- 
tos. Unfortunately, our staff and 
the i'd ili ir should h,n e insisted that 



dity 



he (the editor) sign off on the 
altered photos after the editor had 
reviewed the alterations. Also, we 
and the editor should have insisted 
that a statement be placed in print 
under the photos, explaining that 
the photos were altered with the 
approval of the publisher and the 
editor. Had I been brought into the 
discussion earlier, I would have 
allowed The Communicator's pho- 
tos of the artist's work to be printed 
if the publisher and editor (in 
print) took responsibility for the 
publishing of the photos. The 
Communicator is not a porno- 
graphic magazine, it is a college 
newspaper. And the photos the 
editors decided to print were pub- 
licizing a public event of an artist's 
display on the college campus. The 
photos were on Page 8 of the sec- 
tion and not on the cover. This was 
a learning experience for all of us. I 
have instructed our staff to bring 
me into the loop when issues 
regarding our policies are brought 
to our attention." 

The head-butting comes when 
KPC contends we gave permission 
to alter the photographs. If that 
was their understanding, it was a 
misunderstanding. In life, those 
happen. More than anything, we 
apologi/e to the artist for the alter- 
ing of his photographs. 

It is not our policy to publish 
nudity on the front page, but we're 
not fearful of nipples on the Arts &amp; 
Entertainment section. One of the 
two images considered originally 
offensive reappears unaltered in 
the A&amp;E section of this edition. 



Omnibus Series

Nov. 18, in the Walb Student Union 
Ballroom at 7:30 p.m. The interna- 
tionally respected Native 
American environmental activist 
and author presents "Politics, 
Motherhood, and Environmental 
Justice from a Native Perspective." 
LaDuke (Ojibwe) lives on the 
White Earth reservation where she 
works with the White Earth Land 
Recovery Program, a reservation- 
based land acquisition, environ- 
mental advocacy, and cultural 
organization. She is program direc- 
tor of Honor the Earth, a national 
Native Foundation, and is a 
founder and former cochair of the

'Smile Empty Soul' not a one-hit wonder 



A few years ago Sean Danielsen, 
Ryan Martin, and Derek Gledhill were 
voung adults in Los Angeles County work- 
ing hard at their day jobs to pay rent, so they 
could rock out and play in their separate 
bands at night. 

"My dream is to have fun and earn 
some sort of living troni being in a band. I 
want to pay my bills and be able to travel 
and play music," Martin said. 
After a stint with other bands, the three men 
teamed up to join, which one day would be 
called. Smile Empty Soul, and Martin's wish 
was fulfilled. 

Danielsen then added about the rea- 
soning behind their name. 

"It's just about society, how empty 
people walk around with fake smiles on 



md their first single, "Bottom Of A Bottle,' 
which features the infectious chorus, "1 do it 
for the drugs," has been owning rock radio 

With Danielsen's voice and guitar- 
work, Ryan Martin's bass licks, and Derek 
Gledhill pumping out the cadence, the band 
has been touring non-stop. Bands such as 
Fuel, Seether, Steriogram, and Trapt have 
shared the stage with the trio this year. With 
all the touring comes some bad experiences. 

"Our van was broken into by a crack 
head, we hit a deer, and crashed the van," 
Gledhill said. 

"We have a tour bus now, thanks 
Lava!" Martin added. 

"The major thing 1 love about Lava 
Records is that we weren't worried about 
being dropped if our single didn't catch on. 
Lava has a reputation with sticking with 
artists they've broken," Danielsen said. 

Lava also has Uncle Kracker and A 
Simple Plan on their roster. Both of those 
bands debut albums took upwards of eight 
months to crack the top Hid. Now both Uncle 
Kracker and A Simple Plan are leaders in 
album sales in their respective genres. 

With the security that Lava gives 
them, they are free to express themselves in 
the way they want to. They didn't have a 
label telling them what and what not to do. 
That freedom is greatly desired by young 
bands breaking into the industry. 



and miss their local scene. 

"If you're in a band you know other 
bands and other people in them. It's a small- 
er community within a large city," Martin 

Smile Empty Soul was influenced to 
write a lot of their songs about the commu- 
nity they are from, people they know, and 
themselves. 

"There's personal shit in every song. 
Some of the songs are almost entirely per- 
sonal," Danielsen said. 

A song called "Nowhere Kids" was 
especially taken from the people he knew 
and grew up with. 

"It's basically about us and all of our 
friends in Santa Clarita. Kids in that area 
have attitudes that are just about partying 
and living for the moment than having a 
future. Many don't have a future, they are 
fucked. 1 mean they are 25 and they aren't 
even focused," Danielsen explained. 
The group of people that Danielsen 



described isn't just centralized | 
in Santa Clarita: they are spread 
all over the world. Everyone 
knows someone or a group of 
people stuck in a trap that is just 
sucking them down into a pit of 
despair. 

"I just don't want to 
work anymore," Gledhill 
exclaimed. "1 worked at a burg- 
er place for seven years and I I 
have part ownership r

Bunny," Martin added. 

It's not hard to realize 
the guys in Smile Empty Soul

want it to end. With all the pres- 
sure for success is also the 
added pressure of the media.

poml Danielsen grabs my microphone and 
speaks directly into it. "If you ever review 
our album or are supposed to and you didn't 
listen to it and you admittedly only listened 
to our single, fuck you!" 

"I could never judge a band by just 
one song. I'm mainly just directing all of this 
toward that one interviewer," Danielsen 

One flaw with reviewing someone's 

album, the artist could easily start to become 
pigeon lulled. When you paint an artist in a 
corner they tend to get angry. 

"It's like hearing different parts of a 
conversation. You'd hear 'Bottom Of A 
Bottle' all alone by itself and it's like you're 
hearing something totally out of context, but 
it makes sense with the rest of the album," 
Martin said. 

When a band sits down to write an 
album, it's impossible not to let some of your 
own personal influences leak in on your 

"I'm influenced by John Lennon, 
Deftones, Radiohead and Nirvana," 
Danielsen said. 

I would love to tour with Deftones 

or Foo Fighters, that would be cool," said 
Martin. &gt; 

i really enjoyed meeting and hang- 
ing out with them last time they came to 
town. The guys are having fun and you can 
tell it. Sometimes when you meet a band, 
they seem to just be going through the 
motions and never show real emotion Smile 
Empty Soul proved me wrong with their 
anger towards a certain journalist who took 
something they worked so hard on and 
trashed it without oven listening to a minute 
of the rest of the album. Smile Empty Soul 
has pride in what they recorded and just 
wants justice done when reviewing their 
material they proudly cherish. 

If you are in town on November 14, 
come out to Piere's and catch a good show 
Not only will Smile Empty Soul be there, but 
a band about to release their major-label 
debut, Steriogram, will be opening up. 

Steriogram is a band from New 
Zealand that, from a distance, consists of

IU report: women 
play important 
role in economy 



BLOOMINGTON - Along with 
the shift toward developing more 
scientific and technological firms 
in Indiana and elsewhere has come 
an increasingly vital role for 
women in realms traditionally 
dominated by men, according to a 
new report published by Indiana 
University's Kelley School of 

Author Jennifer Kurtz, a 
research fellow in the Indiana 
Business Research Center, noted 
that the gender gap in compensa- 
tion has been steadily dec re.i sine; in 
technology fields over the last 20 
years. She attributed this trend to a 
combination of factors, including 
growth in the number of women in 
management positions, 
women with advanced degrees 
and women holding patents. 

"Young women have had rela- 
tively few role models to encour- 
age their pursuit of scientific and 
U'chmilogical adventures," Kurtz 
wrote in her article, "Mothers of 
Invention: Women in Technology, " 
in the fall issue of Indiana Business 
Review. "That pattern has begun to 
change as women are increasingly 
present in all dimensions of the 
tion life cycle: knowledge 
n, technology transfer, com- 
Hzation and clusters/net- 

The Indiana Business Review is 

a cjuarterly research publication of 
the Indiana Business Research 
Center. 

She said women must increas- 
ingly pursue science and technolo- 
gy to ensure that the future needs 
for a skilled U.S. workforce are 
met. Average employment growth 
for all professions is expected to 
reach 15.2 percent through the year 
2010, but similar employee 
demand is projected to range from 
52 percent to 100 percent for med- 
iuil assistants, database adminis- 
trators, network /systems adminis- 
s and software engineers. 

"The significance of the project- 
ed |ob boom is not just quantitative 
- more job opportunities — but 
qualitative -- more opportunity 
within jobs," she said. 

While more women are being 
represented in engineering and sci- 
entific fields, more progress needs 
to be made at senior management 
levels. Kurtz found that just 11 per- 
cent of the top 100 U.S. technology 
companies have women corporate 
officers. Only 1.4 percent of 



Standard and Poor's 500 stock 
index companies are led by a 
female chief executive. 

"Women in senior management 
also tend to serve corporate func- 
tions, such as human resources and 

rather than leading business prod- 



uct/a 






According to a National Science 
Foundation report, the percentage 
of science and engineering doctor- 
al degrees awarded nationally to 
women increased dramatically 
between 1966 and 2000, from 8 per- 
cent to 36.2 percent. In the agricul- 
tural and biological sciences, these 
statistics were even more impres- 
sive: the percentage of women 
earning agricultural doctorates 
grew from 1.4 to 29.1 percent over 
the same 34-year period; the per- 
centage of women earning biologi- 
cal doctorates went from 14.8 per- 
cent to 44.8 percent. 

"Female scientists and engi- 
neers still earn less than male col- 
leagues, although the salary gap 
may close as a higher percentage of 
women obtain doctoral degrees," 

Patents are another indicator 
for innovation. 

"One factor is the rate of appli- 
cation: more men than women 
apply for National Institutes of 
Health awards, for example," she 
said. "Although the average award 
rate was comparable, men applied 
twice as frequently for NIH First 
Awards between 1988 and 1997. 
Similarly, women made only one- 
third as many applications as men 
for individual investigator research 
project grants in 1997." 

The nine states account for 
about two-thirds of the national 
research and development effort. 
Two-thirds of the U.S. patents held 
by women originated from these 
states, according to NSF studies. 

But the outlook is changing and 
can be a positive one, she conclud- 
ed. 

"Changes in university policies 
regarding women's eligibility for 
tenure and research positions, 
increased graduate-level educa- 
tional attainment by women in sci- 
ence and engineering, more leader- 
ship opportunities for women in 
high-tech companies," Kurtz said.

By Dan Vance 

Special to The Communicator 

There art 1 always parts of life 
that are hard; it's just the way the 
ball rolls. Certain times are worse 
than others, but nothing that I can 
think of is harder than failure. 

I failed. There just is no easy 
way to put it. Failure is the easiest 
thing to do, yet the hardest to deal 
with. 

High school was not necessar- 
ily easy. But it was not hard. I got 
through, somehow. I slacked; I had 
mediocre, sometimes poor grades. 
But I graduated. I did what I had to 
do to get by.

set that college was going to be just

"We hope the success of the 
Fellowship will encourage other 
companies to follow Symantec's 
lead and establish their own pro- 
grams to further the study of infor- 
mation security," said Dr. Eugene 
Spafford, professor and director of 
CERIAS at Purdue University. 

"Our relationship with 
Symantec illustrates the great 
strides that public and private 
partnerships can make in generat-

to address current and future 
Internet security issues." 

"The need for trained Internet 
security personnel in the United 
Slafes is o^iite real and is a priority 
for Symantec," said Wesley Higaki,

What made the win even 
more impressive, was that the

On the other side of the ball, 
IPFW kept trying to shake Hersey

turning her away. 

That was until the 103rd 
minute of the match. Freshman for- 
ward Alyssa Bailey sent Hersey 
straight up field with a pass. 
Hersey fought off two Rocket 
defenders, and her fifth shot of the 
match found the left comer of the 
net, sending the IPFW bench onto

Incase you didn't already know, 
|he IPFW men's basketball team will 
be playing its games this yeai .it the 
Allen County War Mcmori.il 
Coliseum. It seals 12,000 fans, as 
opposed to the 2,800 capacity of the 
Cites Sports Center. Fans have the 
opportunity to see 12 games ,il the 
Ireshly renovated facility. 

Many people are happy with the 

"For us, pl.nuig .it the( oliseum 
solidifies our move to Division I and 
allows the city of Fort Wayne to gel 
behind us. This arena will help 
secure really good teams such as the 
Butlers, Oregon Stales, Bowling 
Greens to play in Fort Wayne. It will 
also help us in a big way with recruit- 
ing. Now a local student-athlete can 
select IPFW and playing in a venue 
such as this for his college career will 
make it all worth while," said head 
coach Doug Noll. 

Freshman Justin Hawkins 
added, "The Coliseum is going to be 
exciting, both lor the players and the 
fans. It is still hard to believe that I 
get to play in an arena of that size. 
Every time I drive by, I think to 
myself about what it will be like to 
play in there. I think it will be a great 
experience for the team." 

The 6-7 forward from Garrett, 
Indiana is one of six freshmen in the 
program this year. Another new face 
in the crowd is Eric Bergstrom, a 7-0 
center from Milaca, Minnesota. 

"Justin is a great athlete who is 
extremely quick, fast, and will get 



Bergstrom will back up Dave Simon. 
I'm really excited about the freshmen 
and 1 know they will make an impact 
early in the season," said Noll. 

Kecruiting in previous years 
stretched to Wisconsin, where the 
team picked up senior Jim Kessenich. 
Kessenich (at right) is a 6-10 
center/ forward from Pewaukee. 
Last season, Kessenich was in the top 
three in several statistical categories, 
including a 54! field goal percentage. 

This statistic landed him right 
behind IPFW's rising star, David 
Simon. 

David Simon is a 6-10 junior 
center from Ml. Vernon, Illinois. He 
lead the team last season with 175 
rebounds, 39 blocks and was third in 
points per game with 11.3. 

Still don't know who he is? 
Look at the basketball flyers buzzing 
around campus (He is the guy hang- 
ing from the rim on the cover.) He is 
one of nine returning players this sea- 
son. The cliche "Simon says..." has 
been applied to IPFW's Simon and 
has been on promotional materials 
tor the program. 

According to Noll, the off-sea- 
son recruiting was successful. 

"I think we have brought a great 
group of young kids in and our key is 
to develop them into very good 
Division 1 players," he said. 

Freshmen Indiana All-Star Beau 
Bauer and Byron Malone are compet- 
ing with sophomore Tyler Clevenger
