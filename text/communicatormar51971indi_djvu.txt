ment would be May 19. 

Summer school registration would be June 8, 9, 10, with 
classes starting on June 12 and lasting till Aug. 4. July4thi 
would be the only holiday during the summer session. 

During the lost week of each semester, a two-hour time 
period would be available for eochclass. This time would be 
used for final exams, a last non-comprehensive exam, a regu- 
lor class meeting, or anything; tor which the instructor desires 
to use it. However, no instructor would be allowed to give 
any type of exam ia tbe week preceding tbe last week in each 
semester, jhis calendar is still tentative and awaiting 
ratification by the teachers.

session may be nscd for i) final ejiarainations 2) ^ last

The Rcyes/Soler Ballet 
Cspanol de Madrid, inter- 
nationally known Spanish 
dance company, will be in 
Fort Wayne for one perfor- 
mance Saturday, March 13 in 
the theater of the First Pres- 
byterian Church at 8:00 p.rp. 
Tbe ballet group, per- 
forming here under the spon- 
sorship of Indiana University 
at Fort Wayne with the sup- 
port of tbe Indiana State 
Arts Commissioa.will appear 
as part of an Hispanic Arts 
Festival arranged by I.U., 
and coordinated by Dr. Vir- 
ginia Ciaig, assistant pro- 
fessor of Spanish. 

Ballet Espanol covers 
all tbe most colorful phases 
of Spanish dance both in the 
homeland and in Latin Amer- 
ica. Ramon de los Rey^s and 
Lola Solcr, tbe co-stars of 
the company, have appeared 
jhroughout Europe as solo- 
ists with many of tbe most 
renowned dance companies. 
Tbe performing troupe is 
made up of five of Spain's 
finest young dancers,

try. Costumes are authentic

After a stint with the mili- 
tary, he foiroed his own trio 
which opened at the Castel- 
lana Hilton in Madrid. The 
group toured Spain and En- 
gland and then appeared at 
New York's Plaza Hotel. 
L^terde los Reybs argani::ed 
his own Spanish Ballet and 
formed the Alba-Reyes Dance 
Company. After a respite, 
during which he explored the 
immense possibilities of 
choreography, he returned to 
Spain and formed the Reyes/ 
Solcr Ballet. 

Also included in this 
program are: a one-act Mexi- 
can play, a speech by a 
professor on "Mexican The- 
ater Today," a show by a 
classical guitarist and an art 
coat, on pg. ■* 



program will continue as- a 
high priority on the list ot 
future improvements. Adult 

courses will probably not 
experience much growth, be- 
cause "we simply don't 
have space for more classes 
and I believe the needs of 
credit-seeking students 

should tnke precedence over 
those not interested in cre- 
dit." 

As modern and effi- 
cient OS Dr. Broyles finds 
the new campus, he speaks 
wistfully of his days at the 
Barr Street location. "Even 
thoufrfi we were always bras- 
sing about how old and in- 
convenient and dirty the 
place was h-hot in the sum- 
mer and cold in the winter- 
I kind of miss tbe downtown 
locale." He remembers fond- 
ly many luncheons at the 
Chamber of Commerce and 
sighs over the loss ot day- 
to-day contact with old 
friends.

week which totals well over 

40 hours. Dr. Broyles enjoys

SAVE 



your cans 
and bottles 



Although you may have already 
heard about the Coalition for the Envi- 
ronment glass drive, allour me to edu- 
cate those of you who haven't. On 
March- 10, U, and 12, cilitens and 
studentsfto show the older generation 
we're really concerned of the Fort 
Wayne are^ are asked to drop off any 
bottles and gloss that have been 
saved for this reelaimation of glass 
drive. 

By beginning now, it is quite- pos- 
sible for each and every one of us to 
collect several pounds of normally 
thrown away bottles and/or glass 
(these) can be of any size, shape, or 
color} that when recycled will help 
solve one of the problems of poUution- 
wasle disposal. Locations of where 
glass is to be dropped off will appear 
in the next issue, but begin saving 
now. Anyone willing to help at points 
of collection, please call Dave at 
743-1109 after 1 0:00p.m. on week-

Dear Tina: 

I have noticed a general disre- 
spect (or the campus newspaper. The 
COMMUNICATOR, on the pari of many 
of the students and in particular the 
faculty. What is the cause of this? 

Dear A Reader: 

. Some people get their kicks by 
tramping on those smaller than they' 
ore by knocking things (e.g. The Com- 
municator] which Ihey consider lesser 
than themselves. They give no respect 
fo most causes which deserve much, 
much more-and, as o result, receive 
very little of it tt

Dear Editor: 

For a while I was proud 
to be a Free Parker. Now 
I'm not so sure. Any idiot 
knows that when one parks 
a two ton car on wet ground 
the earth gives way and 

damage. I'm referring lo 
the People's Bridge (also 
known as Johnny Appleseea 
Bridge), It seems that those 
Free Parkers are really Paid 
Parkers at heart. If you 
■slobs are too lazy to walk, 
why don't you buy a parking 
sticker instead of tearing 
up a beautiful piece of land? 
Speaking of Paid Park- 
ers, I'm extremely happy 
about the traffic jams caused 
by numerous Paid Parkers 
attempting to leave the lot 
at one time. That's wh&lt;it

member of that SLF machine 
and even rose to the all- 
powerful rank of an election

Dear Editor: 

I would like to say a 
few words to this: news- 
paper's critics— most notably 
the Publications Board, the 
Sutdeni Government, and 
Steve Pettyjohn who. last 
week, referred to "The 
Communicator" as a "simu- 
lated newspaper." Why 
is it that they are so quick 
to ridicule and deride this 
sole means of campus com- 
munication, but refuse lo 
help improve its quality in 
any way. Not only do they

Ihe federalion has decided 
thai Senator Goldwaler shall 
not receive the much heral- 
ded nomination to the brass 
nutted ehromc plated screw 
hall of fame. Since Senator 
Goldwater ia a member of 
the distinguished Senate of 
the United States of America, 
and since he and his col- 
leagues are presently under 
scrutiny by ihe infamous J. 
Edgar for certain alledged 

conspiracies carried out on 
the Capitol building (an in- 
side |oh you know), members 
of the Barbed Wire Federation 
felt no further award to this 
illustrious Senator from Ari- 
zona would be necessary. 
Indiana University and 



^■fac 






undoubtedly the most deserv- 
ing nominee for the coveted 
brass nutted chrome plated 
screw. It is therefore with 
much ado and a great deal of 
pleasure that the Barbed Wire 
Federation forwards to Indiana 
University ( on the tip of our 
middle finger) the brass nutted 
chrome plated screw For valor 
and courage above and beyond 

tape. It seems thol good old 
Indiana University requires 
(in order lo receive Baccal- 



plcted in residence on th( 
Bloomington campus of Ind 
ity and not less 
than 10 credit hours of 
work in the major field of 
study must be completed on 
the Bloomington campus." 
( Taken from I. U. Bulletin 
Vol. LXVIII, no. 13. Bloom- 
ington, Indiana June 15, 1970 
page 14. 

Now contrary to I.U. 
and their beautiful blurp, 
stands the state fathers. 
Yes, fine folks, the Indiana 
State Legislature and, yes. 
Governor Ed, did do a deed 
and then signed it into law 
(in the same year they 
caused tuition to spiral up- 
ward). And it says, "Effec- 
tive with the school year be- 
ginning in September, 1969, 
none of the slate-supported 
universities having regional 
campuses shall have a rule, 
regulation or policy by the 
terms of which that students 
who are pursuing their educa- 
tion at such campuses shall 
be required lo obtain any 
hours of credit in residence 
on the home campus of such 
state university in order to 
obtain a degree, where cour- 
ses to obtain a degree are 
available on the regional 
campus." (Acts 1969, Chap- 
ter 134,Seclion 1 ofTitlc20) 
Amen, Indiana. Amen. 

To I.U. a note of shame, 



you people muster the 
moral responsibility lo obey 
Governor Ed and his people 
or at least not put your anti- 
Amerikan material in print. 
To all those students, who 



: beei 






they are either trying lo 
major in^ Philosophy or 
Biology or chemistry or 
Mathematics or other majors 
at I.U. Fort Wayne, all we 
can say is sorry that you 
have been screwed. How* 
ever, do check with your 
counselor and/or lawyer for

Apologies to Frank and

words are not especially in 
good taste. The Editor

There are -bout 7,000 wor- 
kers on strike and lettuce 
production has dropped over 
one half siace August of last 
year. 

There are ways in which 
you can help the laborers io 
their struggle. If you buy any 
lettuce, be sure it has been 
produced by the UFWOC. If 
it is United Farm Workers 
ietlucc, it will bear a small 
union label with a black ea- 
gle on it. Any lettuce not 
bearing this label is being 
produced under unfair condi- 
tions. Also if you find a gro- 
cer selling lettuce not pro- 
duced by UFW, you can ask 
him if he could sell UFW let- 
tuce, instead of whatever be 



ellin, 



who 






helping the United 
kers can contact me 
al the newspaper office or 
leave a note and your tele- 
phone number at student ser- 
vices (address it to the Com- 
minicator c/o John Court- 
ney.) It would be of great 
help to the local organizing 
committee and to the workers 
in California. Remember,
