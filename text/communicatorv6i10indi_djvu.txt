OPINION 



i amendment !o the Education Act of 1965, grants a student am 
files and records kept on him by his school. 

Naturally the nations college admme.h-ators are crying about the 
Thevare complaining about the work overload that may result if many students 
take advantage of the new privelege. The law gives schools a mere 45 days to 
comply with a request by a student to see his filse. 

Administrators are also concerned about the ramidienlions " J'. 

pergonal Idlers of recommendations to the subject. They predict lhal such "&lt;■'"'" 
will become worthless if faculty know that students may read them. Faculty 
apparently will be less than honest in writing the letters. 

Granted, and ethical problem exists here However, the problem runs deeper 
than faculty concern over confidentiality of the letters. If the Inters an- pn r.n;.l 
and written in confidence, what are they doing In the students files hidden to the 
students but available to other faculty and administrators al Willi An , S°E?*t 
negative Amissions Idler will (ollow the student long after he is admitted, if he is 
at all. That is the real injustlc, 

Cases of such abuses of this confidentiality have hccn well &lt;U&gt;n&gt; m&lt;-&lt;\ 11, i

Protect Ion for the student from the written observations of inept 
teachers was needed, and that need has been met. 

Two years ago The Cuinmiinicahir made n limited invcsligali 
policies and practices of IPFW record keepers. We found (hat l he records 
available to outsiders, a condition not mandatory at that tir»» «• 
that abuses of the system appeared to minimal. 

The Communicator did call (or opening these records to the .students, much 
along the lines ol the new federal law Unfortunately, the university did not open 
those records voluntarily but wailed until it was required to do so by law.

Briegel may go straight for good 



We are always happy to hear constructive 
concerning The Communicatoi Several letters to the editor have been 
discussing the escort service ud. However, nothing helpful 
comments if we don't know why the person is upset with us. 

Caseinpoinl: Keccnllv an irate young lady entered the newspaper office and 
asked to see one of the editors She then threw a shredded copy of The 
Communicator on Ins desk ami said, "This is what I think of your paper," and 
immediately stalked out of the room. This incident didn't particularly upset 
anyone, and probably made the young lady feel much belter Hut what good did it 
really do? She could have accomplished more by slaying and verbalizing on why 
she was unhappy with the newspaper. 

Changing the subject somewhat, we would like to make an appeal to all persons 
who read The Communicator Anyone interested in making his or her views on 
anysubject known please contact us. 

TheCommuniealor is for the students, fatuity, and anyone associated in some 
way with Indiana-pur due University at Fort Wayne. The opinion page should be a 
forum for a wide variety of studenl faculty views, Reviews of books, records, films, 
and plays are always welcome from anyone. 

So If you are unhappy with The Communicator for any reason, don't just sit 
around and gripe about it. Do something about it. If you need more space than a

DICK LUGAR FOR 



DICKLUGAR 
A Senator For 
Indiana Students 

If Dick Li.ni.ir sounds like a college professor when 
he speaks it's because he insists that the solutions 
to the problems of today aren't simple. Lugar, a 
Rhodes Scholar, knows that students are looking 
for leaders. who have a true understanding of 
economics and of inflation. Students demand 
intelligent and comprehensive answers - and that's 
why over 40% of Lugar's speaking engagements are 
in front of young people. Lugar gives complex 
answers to complex problems and students like 
what they hear. They know that what this country 
needs is some brilliant leadership.
