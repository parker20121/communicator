BEECHING WINS $500 
TO TEST WATER 

Felicia Beeching. teaching assistant for the 
department of geosciences, was awarded the Fox 
Island Alliance Research Scholarship at IPFW for 
1992. 

The $500 scholarship. Beeching said, will cover 
the expenses for the research she will conduct this 
summer at Fox Island Park. 

Beeching will be testing water pollution levels at 
various sites in the park, including the bog area. 

"Pollution levels in a preserve such as Fox 
Island are significant because they point to the 
condition of the ground water throughout the 
area," said Breeching. 

"I became interested in this when I took an envi- 
ronmental conservation class in which we were 
required to do a research project. I chose to 
research the pollution and preservation of Laketon 
Bog. in Manchester, Ind.," said Beeching. 

Beeching said that the scholarship caught her 
attention because it covered research of the type 
she had done at Laketon Bog. 

In May. Beecher will receive an associate of gen- 
eral studies degree, and she will continue work 
toward a bachelor's degree in geology. 

Beeching and her husband. Dennis, reside in 
Huntington with their eight children.

Senate passes typewriter resolutions 



By Chad Hesting 
Managing Editor 

Friday's student senate meeting 
saw relatively litlle wrangling 
over Ibe issue of student senator 
Nancy Bargcr's impeachment, as 
the government decided to get 
back to business instead. 

Student senate vice president 
John Weisenburger opened by 
slating that he was, prepared to 
abide by ibe decision of judicial 
court chief justice Kelsey Keys 
on Bargcr's reinstatement. 

Keys had overruled Weisen- 
burger's January 26 decision to 



reinstate Barger, declaring that 
Weisenburger had no constitu- 
tional authority to do so. 

Weisenburger asked the senate 
to refrain from discussion on the 
Barger matter until the Campus 
Appeals Board ruling. Weisen- 
burger said it was "inappropri- 
ate" for them to continue dia- 
logue in the senate forum con- 
cerning Bargcr's case. 

In other business, the student 
affairs committee agreed to 
look at the costs of repairing 
the IPSGA ballot boxes. Stu- 
dent affairs also said ihcy will 



look into improving the visibil- 
ity of IPSGA suggestion boxes 
around campus. 

Weisenburger noted he "had to 
really search" to find the old 
boxes which ;ire located in Neff 
Hall, Classroom Medical Build- 
ing and Heltnke Library. 
Weisenburger said the boxes 
needed painting. He added that 
the boxes were currently being 
used as repasitories for students' 
candy wrappers. 

Student senator Felix Moxier 
suggested that student affairs

Editor in Chief 

Boosted by a big victory over 
No. 4 use. IPFW's men's vol- 
• leyball team has jumped to a 
fifth-place ranking in a national 
poll released Monday by Vol- 
leyball Monthly. 

The Volieydons moved up 
from being ranked tenth in a 
pre-season poll. 

The fifth-place ranking is the 
highest a Midwest team has 
ever been ranked and the second 
highest ranking ever outside of 
California. Penn Slate was 
ranked first in 1988. 

"We'll taJ;e No. 5 and try to 
get better," IPFW coach Amie 



Ball told The News-Sentinel 
Tuesday. "It's a nice honor for 
these kids, but we have a lot of 
work ahead of us," he said. 

IPFW has t&gt;een ranked in the 
top 20 for 79 straight weeks and 
in the top 10 for the last six 
weeks. IPFW's highest previous 
ranking was No. 8 at the end of 
last season. 

The next home match for the 
Volieydons will be Friday at 
7:30 p.m. against Guelph Uni- 
versity of Canada.

Art students unhappy 
with new building 



By Janet Ausbury 
Staff Writer 

Some IPFW fine art students 
say they aren't satisfied with 
their new building, but improve- 
ments are on the way. according 
to a faculty member. 

Scott Beineke, an IPFW fine 
art major, criticized the new 
building for its lack of a student 
lounge. "The simplicity of the 
building is almost like a barn. 
Maintenance has a lounge in the 
boiler room but there's no stu- 
dent lounge," he said. 

"We pay our money to go to 
this campus but we have no 
room to kick back," Beineke 
added. "It really stinks. Especial- 
ly if you're working in the com- 
puter lab where there's no food 
or drinks allowed." 

Fellow fme art student Robert 
Murray agreed that students 
need a lounge in the building. 
"There are two lounges in this 
building. The boiler operator 
has a lounge with a desk and 
five comfy chairs. If this is his 
office then why is it 90 percent 
lounge and 10 percent desk?" 
asked Murray. 

"On the second floor mainte- 
nance people have a fridge that 
used to be the school fridge. 
Now it's the groundspeople's 
fridge," Murray said. He noted 
that there is a coffee pot in the 
second floor maintenance 
lounge, as well as chairs that 
belong in classrooms, 

Murray said that the new build- 
ing does not permit the cama- 
raderie among the arl students 



that once existed at the Berry 
Street locadOii. 

Normnn Bradley, associate 
professor of fine arts, has heard 
the stud.:rt.:;' complaints but he 
says change; are forthcoming. 
Bradley noted that a student 
lounge and a gallery arc to be 
constructed. He said even now 
he likes the new building better 
than the Berry Street facilities. 
"It's definitely better than where 
we were Berry Street just 
wasn't being kept up the way it 
should, Tlie people being paid to 
keep it clean and usable weren't 
doing their jobs. 1 used to have 
to sweep the rooms in the old 
building before I could teach 
class," Bradley said. 

"New buildings have bugs, but 
you have to be in them to work 
them out," Bradley said. 

But Murray sees the problems 
as more liian "bugs". He noted 
several aesthetic and safety- 
related problems in the new 
building. He said there is inad- 
equate and possibly dangerous 
placements of air nozzles in the 
graphic design studios and no 
natural light for the painting 
studios. 

"You can't do anything color 
correct with fluorescent light- 
ing," Murray said. 

Murray also complained that 
too many easels in the painting 
studios obstruct students' views 
of what they are painting. He 
added that some of the chairs 
break and collapse easily and 
diat there is a lack of eye-wash- 
ing sLitions in die building. 



Murray is also concerned with 
the lack of ventilation in the 
building, "Chemicals are gelling 
recirculated into the air instead 
of being taken out. When work- 
ing with resins, which are really 
bad for your health, the fumes 
get into the air system and end 
up in the computer room," Mur- 
ray noted. 

Fine art students have also 
complained about the lack of a 
lecture hall in the new building. 
The students are currently 
attending their lecture classes in 
other buildings, Bradley said a 
lecture ball will also be added to 
the building. And he noted prob- 
lem with the crowded painting 
studio would be taken care of 
after the room is reconstructed to 
better accommodate siudenLs. 

Bradley conceded that having 
no natural light or outdoor 
view is a handicap for painting 
and drawing students, He also 
said there was a problem with 
fumes in the painting studio. 
He said that he wishes there 
was at least one general class- 
room in the building. 

He added that be would like a 
parking area closer to the build- 
ing because students and faculty 
often carry heavy materials from 
home to school and back. 

But Bradley said these prob- 
lems were minor. "I wouldn't 
go back to the old building." 
he said. 

Murray said he liked the old 
building better. "It's hke the stu- 
dents weren't even thought of in 
this," he said. 



Program offers students chance 
at different college experience 



By Jim Walker 
Editor In Chief 

This is your chance to get out 
of here. 

An informational meeting on 
the National Student Exchange 
program will be held Monday, 
Feb.lO, at noon in KctUer Hall. 
Room 108. 

Through the NSE program 
IPFW students can attend odier 
colleges across the USA, includ- 
ing schools in far away places 
like Alaska. New Mexico. Mas- 



sachusetts and Rorida. 

According to Laura Herbrand, 
IPFW's NSE coordinator, stu- 
dents pay IPFW tuition rates, 
can receive financial aid as usual 
and get transfer credit toward 
IPFW degrees, 

Herbrand said the February 10 
meeting has been set up to give 
students the scoop on the pro- 
gram and to answer any ques- 
tions the students might have 
about NSE. 

"For people who didn't get to 



go to a main campus or a resi- 
dential campus this program 
gives them a chance," Her- 
brand said. 

"People go for different rea- 
sons," she said. "Sometimes stu- 
dents like 10 go where the 
weather is nice and some go to a 
school strong in dicir major." 

Herbrand noted that students 
from the program currently 
attend colleges in Pueno Rico, 
California, New Jersey and 
South Carolina. 



meetings should double as open 
forums for student suggestions 
instead of keeping up the boxes. 
Moxter said the money saved 
could go toward publicizing the 
meetings. 

The senate also passed two res- 
olutions during Friday's meeting. 
The first directed IPSGA to keep 
a typewriter in the student gov- 
ernment office, The typewriter is 
to be for use by members of the 
student body. Student senator 
Victoria Vinson objected to the 
resolution because the incgutar 
office hours would restrict stu- 



dent use of die typewriter, 

"I think the senate will be seen 
as running student money into 
our own pocket with the type- 
writer." Vinson added. 

The second resolution decreed 
that two typewriters will be 
placed in the Center for Women 
and Returning Adults. The type- 
writers in that office can also be 
used by students, according to 
the wording of tlie resolution. 

The next senate meeting will 

be at 3 p.m. tomorrow in Walb 
Memorial Union. 



Facilities for disabled to 
be updated, improved 



By Mike Wilde 
News Editor 

Members of the IPFW commu- 
nity who have disabilities may 
benefit from the Americans with 
Disabilities Act of 1990. 

Chancellor Joanne Lantz 
issued a memorandum on Jan. 
22 stating that IPFW needs to 
lake four steps in order to 
assure compliance with the 
ADA, 

The steps mentioned by Lantz 
are: "evaluation of facilities 
and programs for accessibility 
and nondiscrimination: appli- 
cation of ADA standards for 
physical access in construction 
and alteration projects; imple- 
mentadon of readily achievable 
changes to improve accessibih- 
ty; and training to acquaint the 
campus with the basic provi- 
sions of the ADA. " 

Lantz assigned the responsi- 
bility of coordinating these 
activities to Randall Borst. 
director of the office of dis- 
abled student services. 

Borst will chair an ADA task 
force. 

"The ADA task force will help 
the entire campus community as 
we advance our nation's conunil- 
Dient to extend basic rights and 
opportunities to persons with 
disabiUdes," according to Lantz. 

In accordance with the ADA 
mandate that IPFW evaluate its 
facilities and programs. IPFW is 
currendy collecting data. 

The data will include the 
height of the rcstroom sinks and 
the location of the handicapped 
parking areas, said Borst, 

"Basically we want to know 
if a person with a disability 
can come here and do the 
same things that others can 
do," said Borst. 

Borst explained the require- 
ment that all construction and 
remodeling projects meet 
ADA standards. 

Even if an area to be remod- 
eled is not accessible to people 
with disabilities, the area must 
meet ADA standards in case the 
area eventually becomes accessi- 
ble, said Borst. 

"This means that at some point 
the plans for construction will 
have to be documented and 
approved," said Borst. 

Keitler Hall will be impacted 
by the ADA requirement that 
IPFW implement "readily 
achievable changes" to create a 
more accessible campus for per- 
sons widi disabilities. 

Because Keider Hall was built 



before 1977, it was previously 
exempt from many ADA stan- 
dards. Now it will need to 
undergo changes which are 
deemed readily achievable, 
said Borst. 

Borst said that one of the 
changes may be to lower (be 
position of die room numbers, so 
that Lhey are easier to see. 

The room number should also 
be in contrasting colors, on the 
latch side of the door and in 
braille, according to BorsL 

The final step for IPFW is to 
acquaint the campus with the 
ADA standards, 

Borst said that he and the 
Chancellor decided to add this 
step in order to create a more 
amiable and educated environ- 
ment here at IPFW. 

People who have not encoun- 
tered persons with disabilities 
are often uncomfortable in the 
presence of a disabled individu- 
al, s;ud Borst. 

IPFW student Lenn Fiedler, 
who has a sight impairment, 
agreed that people who are 
unaccustomed to persons with 
disabilities react differently 
from those who are familiar 
wid) disabilities. 

Fiedler, who has a 5.85 GPA. 
said, "A lot of people who have 
not been around a person with a 
disability, when they speak to 
me. will speak very slowly, 
loudly, and with words that 
aren't more than two syllables." 

"I'm blind, not hard of hearing 
and not stupid." he said. 

Fiedler added that he did not 
have difficulty with the accessi- 
bility of facilities. 

"My instructors have gone out 
of their way to make overheads 
and other inaccessible items 
available to me." said Fiedler. 

Borst and Fiedler agreed that 
persons with learning disabilities 
have the hardest time because 
dieir disability is invisible. 

Borsl said Oiat he would like to 
see the time when learning dis- 
abled individuals are afforded 
the same considerations that oth- 
ers receive. 

Lantz, concluding the memo- 
randum, staled, "Compliance 
with the ADA will improve 
IPFW's servic«s and support our 
high standards of academic 
achievement, thus enabling more 
individuals to live, work and 
prosper in ways previously 
unavailable to them." "If this act 
ends up empowering the dis- 
abled, it could instigate real 
social changu," said Borsi.

Japan not to blame 
for America's woes 



America needs a new enemy. Witb (he Soviet 
Union out of Lhe way and the Cold War over, the 
USA needs an enemy to blame for our problems. 
Americans need an enemy to watch for over our 
shoulders. We need a nation to fear. 

So there's Japan. "The damn Japanese are tak- 
ing over the country," people often complain 
now. "The Japs are buying up America--even 
Ijaseball, 'America's Pastime.'" others gripe. 

Some people in this nation blame Japan for 
America's current economic problems. They say 
American jobs are lost because of the domination 
of Japanese merchandise in the U.S. market- 
place. 

"Buy American!" is becoming the big slogan. 

But who is really lo blame? Japan's prime min- 
ister Kichi Mayazawa has an idea. "I have long 
thought that they (Americans) lack a work ctbic 
... to live by the sweat of their brow." 

Kabtin Muto, a fellow Japanese lawmaker said, 
"I think Americans should Icam how to work 
properly from Monday to Friday." He said 
America's focus on weekends as well as the dnig 
problems here arc major factors in the deteriora- 
tion of the U.S. economy. 

Other Japanese officials have said Americans 
are lazy, illiterate and less intelligent than 
Japanese. 

Many Americans are enraged by these com- 
ments. Who are they lo call call us lazy? Who 
are they to make these judgemenus? 

They are the leading economic power in Ihe 
world. They are the nation that took American 
inventions, like the automobile, and made them 
better. Japan is the nation wiih all of the money. 

Bui are they right about American workers? 
Are the time-card punchers to blame? Yes and 
no, American workers certainly could work hard- 
er, but that's not the real problem. American 
workers are not responsible for the poor deci- 
sions made by U.S. corporate managers. And 
American workers arc not to blame for the way 
manufacturers have dragged their feel i 



ing technological advancement. 

American auto companies complain about how 
hard it is for them lo market their cars in Japan 
but the aulo makers send these cars over to Japan 
like ihey make them here-with the steering 
wheel on the left side of the car. In Japan, they 
drive on the opposite side of the road. Would 
anyone buy Japanese cars in America if the 
steering wheel was on the wrong side? 

Insiead of wising up and making changes to the 
cars as an effort lo improve overseas sales, 
American auto companies just whine lo lhe gov- 
ernment for legislation to help ihem. This is lazi- 
ness! 

But American companies are starting to get the 
message. How can they miss il? Consumers are 
buying what's best. Sony sells better than G.E. 
because it is belter, G.E. could work harder and 
improve but until it docs Sony will keep winning 
in the market economy. American companies 
must improve research and development. They 
must push factory automation and other manu- 
facturing advances. Some of this has started now, 
especially with the auto makers, but much more 
needs to be done. American companies now have 
to overcome the negative images they were 
lagged wiib during the 1970s and 1980s. 
Remember what everyone thought of Chrysler? 

Until American manufacturers come up to 
Japan's standards, consumers should not feel bad . 
buying best insiead of buying American. It is our 
choice to buy the best under the free market 
economy of a capitalist nation. And it is our 
responsibility as consumers lo send a message to 
manufacturers of poorly made goods by saying 
"we won't buy iL" 

The Japanese people our not our enemies. As 
educated, and hopefully enlightened, individuals 
we must not perpetuate the kind of racism and 
stupidity attached with Japan bashing. We can't 
make Japan our scapegoat. We need lo look at 
America and see what can be done to improve it. 
We don't need a new enemy. 



Ft. Wayne Pro-lifers 
defend their stance 



To the Editor 

We are writing in response to Chad nesting's 
commentary last week on the pro-life march Sat- 
urday. Feb. 25. The march was indeed a sepa- 
rate entity than thai of the Northeast Indiana 
Rescue Organization. Mr. Hcsting, you com- 
mented that this contention was "laughable" 
because "about one in every 10 persons walking 
had been pickcters of lhe Women's Health Orga- 
nization Clinic." Indeed, your siatement is 
laughable in itself 

You continue, presuming thai because 10 per- 
cent &lt;if this fact, in itself, is correct) of the 
marching populauon were involved in Operation 
Rescue, the entire parade consisted of hypocriti- 
cal, an ti- freedom -of- any -kind, law-breaking 
monsters. We beg to differ. 

In 1989, approximately one out of every 10 
Americans was arrested at one time or another. 
Does that make the entire nation criminal? Thai 
same year, 1,6 of every 10 persons 18-21 years 
of age involved in a fatal accident were legally 
drunk. E&gt;oes this make it safe lo assume thai all 
fatal accidents arc caused by teenage drunk driv- 
ing? 

We arc not ashamed lo admit thai we partici- 
pated in the march thai cold Saturday (funny, we 
were on the end and didn't sec any homeless), 
yet we do not necessarily condone lhe tactics of 
Operation Rescue. We simply believe in the 
pro-life cause. It's foolish and ridiculous to 
assume that because a small segment of the pop- 
ulation may aci in a manner hypocritical to their 
beliefs (if that's so), that the entire group is simi- 
lar. 

You mentioned ihat "homclessness, child 
abuse. AIDS all go by ihe wayside while pro-lif- 
ers pursue their lenuous. divisive debaie." Yes, 
sorry to disappoint you. but we are presently 
unable lo save helpless millions of children 
being killed every week and lake on the added 
responsibihlics of these causes, too. We haven't 
seen Greenpeace helping out Amnesty Interna- 



lional lately. Nor have we noticed SCAN lend- 
ing a hand to Habitat for Humanity. 

We. like them, have our own cause that our 
time is dedicated to. Also, in the 1-ort Wayne 
area, who is responsible for most of the charity 
organizations? The ihree local hospitals, the 
Rescue Mission, and the soup kitchen are funded 
and supported by churches. Where are the shel- 
ters and hospitals funded by Planned Parent- 
hood? 

Contrary to your belief, lhe reversal of the 
sexual revolution is not the anti-abortion move- 
mcni's sole intent (we think AIDS is doing well 
in that task by ilselO Instead, the purpose of the 
anti-abortion movement is just thai--to make 
abonion illegal on both the local and national 
fronts. A little more research would be much 
appreciated ... Few pro-lifers oppose birth con- 
trol and sen education entirely. We. ourselves, 
are very much in favor to both these remedies. 
Belter lo have used your brain-and binh control- 
-the first lime around than lo kill an innocent 
child as the result of ignorance. 

Many pro-choicers argue thai it's a "woman's 
right" to do what she wants with her body. Yes, 
it is. It's a woman's right lo decide to have sex. 
li's a woman's right to be responsible and make 
sure thai birth control is used. The rights of a 
woman end, like any other citizen of this coun- 
try, when she decides to take tlie life of another 
human being. 

No. we aren't "forgeiting our brothers and sis- 
ters by wasting energy on the abortion question," 
Instead, we arc remembering the brothers and 
sisters ilial everyone else seems to have forgotten 
in their hurry for convenience. And, sadly 
enough, these brothers and sisters cannot speak 
out for themselves.

Lehers to The Editor 



Student is 'mad as hell' at Follet's Store 



To the Editor 

At the beginning of the 
semester I went to Folleti's 
Bookstore lo purchase books for 
my new classes; and while I was 
there I thought I'd sell some of 
my old iCKlbooks from previous 
classes thai 1 didn't need any- 
more. 

Well, you can imagine my 
shock when lhe clerk at the 
book-buying counter informed 
me that four of the six books that 
I tried to sell were books that 
they were "overstocked" on, so 
they couldn't offer me any cash 
for them. The other two books, 
which they did decide to buy. 
had somehow decreased greatly 
in value from the time that I had 



originally bought ihcm. 

I was offered a total of S6.50 
for both books, take it or leave 
it-even though I had piud sub- 
stantially more for them just one 
or two semesters before. 

Another book which I had 
bought the previous semester for 
$13 was also practically worth- 
less; the clerk offered me a piti- 
ful fifty cents for it I told him 
to forget it; I'd rather keep the 
lx&gt;ok than throw more than $12 
down lhe drain. 

At the time, I was merely a lit- 
tle angry, but the more I think 
about it, the more outraged I 
t&gt;ecomc. What makes Follelt's 
think they can gel away with 
this? 



They are ripping off all of the 
students al this university, and 
what's worse, they don't seem to 
give a damn. As long as they 
make a profit, that's all they care 
abouL 

The problem is that Oiere's no 
competition to force them to 
change their ways. They're the 
only bookstore on campus and 
the only bookstore in town that 
offers the textbooks thai the shi- 
dents need for Iheir classes. 
They know they have a 
monopoly and therefore feel no 
pressure to offer fair prices for 
used textbooks. 

They make their profits, while 
the students have to suffer by 



paying higher and higher prices 
for textbooks, and ihen getting 
practically nothing when they 
attempt to sell them back. 

Well. I have a message for Fol- 
leti's: enough is enough. If a 
majority of the students at this 
campus would rally together and 
put some pressure on Follett's to 
change their book-buying poli- 
cies, then perhaps we can turn 
this situation around. I think it's 
time for us students lo march 
down to the bookstore and deliv- 
er our ultimatum for fairness to 
Follett's; "We're mad as hell and 
we're not going to take it any- 
jnbre!"

Senator has cure for Snyder's 'harangues' 



To the Editor 

At the outset, I will apologize 
lo the readers as a collective 
group if this sounds like one of 
Mark Snyder's little harangues. 
However, I feci thai some points 
must be made in light of a recent 
statement issued by this individ- 
ual 10 Tlie Communicator. 

Mr. Snyder has stated that he 
entered into the governmental 
process in order to fight from 
within the system rather than 
outside of it. Ignoring the ques- 
tion of the validity of fighting a 
system that represents such as 
vast microcosm of American 
society (this writer believes that 
there are much broader problems 
to be addressed), one must 
examine the results of his 
"fighL" 



The IPSGA has received a 
great deal of bad press, at times 
well-deserved. It makes one 
wonder what is the cause. 1 
speak now not only as one who 
is currently, intimately involved 
in IPSGA but has had close 
friendships with members for 
quite some lime. My own obser- 
vations are that Mr. Snyder, 
rather ihan "fighting" in a man- 
ner which truly utilizes the sys- 
tem and therefore accomplishes 
acts which benefit the IPFW 
society, has performed in such a 
fashion which has (and, to a cer- 
tain extent, still docs) disrupted 
IPSGA lo the point of tearing it 
asunder. Even John Adams, the 
engine behind our country's 
movement for independence, 
was unable to accomphsb any- 
thing by altempting lo cram res- 



olutions down the collective 
throat of the Second Continental 
Congress, It was through the 
tact and persuasive talents of his 
alhes that the Congress declared 
this nation's independence. Mr. 
Snyder seldom, if ever, relied 
upon anything but brute force. 

The result is plain for anyone 
to sec. Rather lhan becoming a 
positive force, he became a noi- 
some bother who anyone more 
irascible temperaments became 
annoyed with Mr. Snyder and 
tried everything possible to 
block his every move. It 
becomes increasingly unclear to 
me how this man can have the 
sheer gall to cry over the "futili- 
ty" of this or any system. Even 
one with a novice sense of 
human psychology can predict 
the results of such Neanderthal 



behavior. 

I call upon the staff of The 
Communicator lo take the best 
possible action concerning this 
tiresome wind; ignore him. I 
have come to know several of 
the staff of ihis newspaper and 
respect each individual's sense of 
professionalism, and know that 
they would hate to see the stu- 
dent body treat this publication 
as, at best, a surrogate soap 
opera revolving around Mr. Sny- 
der's latest installments: and, at 
worst, to be regarded as yet 
another tabloid I ask these 
excellent professionals and the 
student body to do the worst 
thing possible to such a pueiile 
mentaliiy: ignore him utterly 
and completely.

THE COMMUNICATOR 



Church is dedicated 
to society's troubles 



To Ihe Editor 
In last week's Communicaior, 
Chad llesiing wroie a harsh ami- 
pro-life article founded on liitle 
more llian personal bias. He seemed 
very disiraughi over die M:irch for 
Life's temporary inhibiting of traffic 
flow ihrougb Fori Wayne's streets 
and remarked that they were "forget- 
ting their brothers and sisters," The 
lifers apparently paid litlle attention 
to the homeless as they marched 
through die city and were even por- 
trayed wearing blinders in the edito- 
rial canoon accompanying nesting's 
article. Well, to those out there who 
would like lo read something less 
concerned about stereotyping and a 
few minutes' delay at an intersection, 
here is the odier side of the story. 

I was raised a Cntholic and know 
much of their attitudes concerning 
abortion. The basic premise of our 
belief is die sanctity of human life. 
At the moment of conception, the 
life created receives the great gifts of 
life and of opportunity. Abortion at 
any phase of the pregnancy destroys 
this life and the inevitable human 
being it would have become. 



By marching, the pro-lifers were 
trying to express that abortion is 
senseless destruction of human life 
and is a shameful law that should be 
repealed. 

Now let us shift our ailcnlion to 
die homeless problem although it is 
irrelevant to the Issue at hand. The 
Cadiolic and Proiesuint churches are 
bodi dedicated lo many of America's 
social problems. Homelessness is 
no exception. The St. Mary's soup 
kitchen has been a haven for Fort 
Wayne's underfed for many years 
and both churches give millions of 
dollars in charitable donations per 
year to combat homelessness. 

But abortion is not an economic 
or a social problem, it is a moral 
problem. The marches are held to 
preserve the life of die unborn, those 
who cannot protest Qieir own deaUi. 

Human life is sacred and tangi- 
bles such as money and traffic 
become secondary when it comes to 
diis issue of life and dcadi. 

So \ake die blinders off, Hcsting. 
There are two sides to every issue.

Fighting costs students 



To the Editor, 

Its like a battle between die Hat- 
ficlds and McCoys. Why don't die two 
fighting parties sit down and work out 
their differences? It works from time 
to time. I see a tot of people on both 
sides getting burned by the political 
slams on each odier--a waste of lime 
and energy. I sec liide progress being 
made by either group. We are adults, 
why not try seeing both sides and com- 
ing up with a reasonable compromise? 
Slop die batUe of egos and try lo\'ing 
thy neighbor. Isn't there enough strife 



on campus? This petty fighting isn't 
doing anyone any good. Look for a 
solution instead of a way of getting 
even. Like I said, good people on bodi 
sides are being hurt. To make it worse 
there is no real good coming from it. 
Let's look at ourselves and put aside 
our personal differences. Look for 
solutions, not how to get even. Pro- 
mote harmony, not strife. Use our 
energies for the betterment of our cam- 



pus.

Typewriters are wanted 



To the Editor: 

Regarding Krislina Frazier-Hctiry's 
intention to dispose of typewriters due 
to lack of student interest, I can only 
assume she is out of touch with the 
majority of her constituents. Many 
students have expressed a desire to 
rent typewriters and have expressed 
this to myself and not a few odiers, 
including Bettye Poignard inMuldcul- 
tural Services. Considering student 
government has its own suite of 
offices and is budgeted for full-time 



office help. I can only wonder why 
these typewriters have not been 
offered by them, dirough their offices, 
by their own staff. When buying the 
equipment falls within the guidelines 
of dieir organb,ation, how can distribu- 
tion of it not?

Graham demands fair treatment for Barger 



To the Editor; 

Seeing that the !PFW student gov- 
ernment has yet to solve their internal 
confiicLs and return to serious work 1 
ask you to print this letter. Over die 
past few weeks the student govern- 
ment has furthered its impeachment 
proceedings and the student body 
president has \vrittcn several letters in 
her defense. In addition to my prior 
questions 1 present these; 

The first question I have requires a 
simple yes or no answer. Did internal 
affairs ever ask Baiger what she said 
or in what coniext? Remember lliat 



words can be misleading or taken out 
of context. A fair and just investiga- 
tion requires questions of both the 
accusers and the accused. Not only 
have I heard that you never ques- 
tioned Barger (words from her own 
mouth) neither do I see any attempt to 
peaceably solve this. If you will not 
listen to fairness, answer this: what 
about the police reports that support 
Barger's claim? If fairness is your 
motive it is of a twisted kind. 

On Sunday, Jan, 26, Barger's case 
was dismissed because of violation of 
procedure. Instead of aiiempting lo 



correct their actions internal affairs 
cried fowl and went to campus 
appeals. Not only did they fail to 
take advantage of a second chance at 
a trial, they still refuse to see their 
mistakes, even when pointed out by 
dicir own judicial court. Speaking of 
court, I understand that Mike Will of 
internal affairs had his picnire taken 
as a member of the judicial court. 
Kristina Frazier-Henry. is this 
because of his 2 1/2 months on senate 
(and Internal Affairs) has shown you 
his abihties or is this a way lo pack 
the court, considering all Ihe 



Riddle rips pro-choice article 



impeachment appeals that are pend- 
ing? 

How about some quotes from the 
student body president on IPFW stu- 
dent government: "Watching your 
back became a daily ritual in the IPS- 
GA offices. If you did not resign, 
you fought tooth and nail to accom- 
plish something .,, If working through 
the system failed (a rarity), then we 
tried other avenues." I won't even 
begin to guess the avenues she has 
tried. 

I end my letter with an appeal for 
all students of IPFW: Get involved! 
Tliese people liave the ability to fur- 
ther all aspects of IPFW. Make sure 
they do. 

Denk Graham 
IPt- W Graduiite 



To the Editor 
Mr. Hesting 1 found your editorial 
"Pro-lifers Create Ctiaos" insulting and a 
misleading distortion of the truth. 
Whether or not the article was printed 
out of spite or ignorance only you know. 
It seems strange lo me that out of all 
ihe marches or blockades that 1 have 
witnessed or participated in, I have nev- 
er observed the insensiUvc behavior tliat 
you described. If in fact these events are 
anything more than a creative aitempi to 
put local pro-lifers in a bad light I would 
be equally appalled, but I know this is 
not the norm and the clinic was closed 
during Saturday's march so iherc were 
no clients going to the building. In fact 
the only noise to be heard was itie frus- 
trated swearing of a couple of abortion 
rights activisls in response to the large 
crowd. 

I have talked wiih a family member 
who very much supports abortion 
"rights." Her and I can talk until we are 
blue in die face and what it comes down 
to is that we see and share the same con- 
cerns about society but strongly disagree 
over what should be done about ihem, 
SVc leave the conversation frustraied bul 
siill friends. 

I have also seen the ugly side of the 
"pro-choice" movement. Those individ- 
uals wtio call me in the middle of the 
night in response lo my editorials. One 
man told me " ... let die (blacks) abort 
they breed like rabbits anyway ... ," 
Another threatened me and my child. 
During rescues I have seen "feminists" 
stomping on, spitting on. and swearing 
at other women because they choose to 
identify with the unborn. In fact these 
"feminists" subjccied one pro-life wom- 
an to all kinds of cruet ridicule pertain- 
ing to her weight, yet none of these pro- 
lifers retaliated, they remained still. 
some in prayer and others in tears, Mar- 
garet Sanger founder of ihe naiion's 
biggest promoter and provider of abor- 
tions-Planned Parenthood— was a while 
supremacist who was closely associated 
with the Eugenics program of Adolph 
Hitler, Margaret has been quoted as 
saying "We do not want the word to go 
out ihat we want to exterminate the 
Negro population" and "The most mer- 
ciful thing a large family can do for ils 
family is kill one of its members," Is 



this, Mr. Hesting, something you are 
proud of? 

I would like to know what you, the 
arrog^t Mr, Hesting. is doing to help 
the homeless you seem so concerned 
with. Do you give or volunteer for char- 
ities that attempt to provide these people 
with shelter, clothes and food as many 
pro-life Christians do? I feel it shallow 
that you can criticize people for some- 
thing you don't know anything about, 
many pro-lifers give sacrificially of dicir 
time and money to create a better world. 
Or is abortion Ihe ultimate answer for 
you? Abort Ihe poverly stricken, the 
handicapped, die unwanted and presto 
change-o you have a perfect world 
where there is no poverty, abuse, or 
neglect. Then whai do we do with the 
80 percent of abused children that come 
from wanted pregnancies? 

What I am getting at is thai pro-lifers 
come from all walks of life. Some are 
even former abortionists. Though the 
majority and the most visible are from a 
variety of Chrisdan denominations there 
are other organizations such as Atheists 
for Life and Feminists for Life. There is 
a difference between preventing a 
human life and killing that life once it 
has been created. If you were to gener- 
alize pro-lifers you could say "ihey work 
for die day when all human life will be 
treasured and respected" and unlike you 
they are not apathetic to their unborn 
brothers and sisters who for any reason 
can be pulled apart or poisoned dien dis- 
carded as human garbage. 

Which brings me lo another question. 
Since you are for "choice" maybe you 
would like to explain to me, and the rest 
of your readers, what you and your "pro- 
choice" buddies are doing lo ensure that 
women are not forced by poverty, an 
abusive situation or the blindfold of 
ignorance into abortion? That is why 
the majority of pro-lifers are Uiere at the 



clinic to let women know we do care 
and want to help. In the phone book 
under abortion alternatives there are a 
number of organizaiions designed lo 
help fulfill the emoiional as well as 
physical needs of both modier and child. 
Pro-lifers not only open their pocket 
books 10 these women and their chil- 
dren, but their homes and hearts as well. 
Parenting skills and getting an education 
to become self suppordve are stressed. 

I pity you, Mr, Hesdng. that you have 
never held an infant in your arms or 
watched as a mother displays her lender 
love for thai infant, the same infant thai 
only months before she had intended to 
abort. For if you had experienced this 
joy you would have known that we are 
not "wasting" our time. 

I know there are people who will 
doubt my aedibility and I wouldn't want 
diem to take my word for it or anyone 
else's, they can observe for ihemsclves 
who is telling ihe trudi and who is the 
liar. Go see the abortion facility Ihat 
still stands afier Molly Yard announced 
to all of America that "anti-choice 
zealots firebombed die clinic and burned 
it to the ground," That small fire of 
which investigators have not suspected 
foul play bul rather the homeless u^ing 
to cook on die facility's air conditioner.

'Stupid' traveler tells cautionary tale: Don't trust Guns n' Roses 



By Chad Hesling 
Managing Editor 

What did you do during the blizzard, 
the one thai shut down IPFW? 

You tried to stay cozy, I'll bcl 
Rubbed yotirs bands in front of a wann 
"Murphy Brown" rerun and prayed 
thai I&amp;M coulJ keep tbc Juice flowing. 
Right? 

Wimps! Slackers! None of these 
"Golly gee. I might get cold out there- 
excuses for me. I decided that that 
particular Monday nighl would be tbc 
perfect time to assert my manliness by 
taking an all-night road trip to Dayton, 
Ohio to sec Guns n' Roses. 

Simply drive home fast after ihe 
show to beat the bnint of the blizzard. 
Easy, right? 

Wrong. You can call me stupid now. 

Driving down to Dayton went 
smoothly enough. The temperature 
bung at 40 degrees. My girifriend's 
new Cadillac took my 75 mph puni.sh- 
ment tike a cbamp. I had Bad Brains 
music pounding tiirougb the speakers, 
and a fine buzz in my head from drink- 
ing a gallon of cheap gas station cof- 
fee. I took my seat in the arena al 
eight on ihc dot, and waited. 

And waited, and waited. I stared. I 
drummed my fingers. I hummed 
■"Sweet Child o* Mine" over and over, 
until the girl next to me told me to shut 
up. 1 people watched until I had lewd 
niclaiamc.s for everyone in the arena. 

Guns N' Roses look the stage at

after the alleged start time. Axl plead-

Anyway, those greasy rats threw me 
off my storm schedule. The rain was 
pouring as I hustledout of Dayton. 




Real-liTe stories 
by ChatJ Hasting 



A piece of good luck, I thought. 
Maybe the temperature will hold all 
ihe way up the interstate. 

I snapped the radio on to an AM sta- 
tion. "Expect steady rain to continue 
in the south of Ohio," the announcer 
said, "with temperatures dropping as 
you go further..." 

As he said "north," the rain switched 
(o snow." Just like that. Huge flakes 



in my headlights, coming at mc like 
Space Mountain at Disney World. 

My forward vision disappeared first, 
then the white lines al the side of the 
road. Gosh, I thought, no wonder 
there wasn't any trafric out tonight. 

Go ahead and call mc stupid again. 

I fell in behind a McDonald's semi 
and kept a steady 20 mph pace. The 
snow whirled in my headlights and 
wind rattled the windows. I don't 
believe in a God, but I scanned the sky 
for a place to pin some faith. 

All I could see was Ronald McDon- 
ald. 

"Our Ronald, who an on a semi." I 
whispered, "be my beacon out of this 
sionn tonight" 

Ronald grinned his red grin at me as 
if to say. "It's okay. kid. We'll have a 
McJordan and laugh when this is all 
over." 

A huge snowball flew by Ronald and 
me with a big WHOOSH! I could 
make out the tailighis of a tanker 
rolling by at twice our speed. 

The McDonald's cab sprouted an arm 
out of its side that shook a fist at the 
passing tanker. I was disappointed. 
Divine Ronald was steered by a human 
hand after all. 

Finally 1 caught sight of ihe sign, 
"U.S. 30-Fort Wayne-Merge right." 
but there was nothing but a white 
snowbank underneath. Not even 
tracks to follow. 

HcUTu'e! I drove right past it. How

planned lo drive to Deiroil. 

Three miles later, another sign 
appeared. "Highway 66-Cowlick, 
Ohio-Merge Right." A pair of tire 
tracks merged off into the snow, so i 
followed them down. 

The tracks soon made a wiggling line 
in the snow, then a figure eighi, Uben 
dumped off [he high side of the ramp. 
I peered lo make out the speeding

I aimed die Caddy straight and slow

several convenient snowdrifts to park

of a buried Impala and went inside. 

All the truckers stopped talking when 
I walked in. I slopped and balled my

"Uh, no. 1 went down to Dayton lo

Women faculty face chilly, unfair climate 



By Sanili Jakacky 
Features Editor 

Sexism is somclbing that women 
must learn lo deal with because iJicy 
can't do anything about it. 

Women have smaller brains iban 
men. 

Afnnnative action activists are just 
whiny, single femaJes. 

These arc just a few of many similar 
responses that Deborah Dalogh and 
Mary Kite, members of the deparuneni 
of psycbologica] sciences at Ball Slaic 
University, received to ibeir survey on 
job discrimination ai BSU. 

Balogh and Kile presenicd tlieir 
research in a seminar called "The 
Chilly Climate for Women Faeully" at 
IPF\V on Tuesday. 

They have organized a task force 
addressing the siaius of women faculty 
on college campuses, and have con- 
ducted extensive research on job dis- 
crimination. 

Elaine Blakcmore, assisiant psychol- 
ogy professor at IPFW, said, "The spe- 
cific goal is primarily informational. lo 
make people aware [hat the experi- 
ences of female faculty members arc 
different from the experiences of male 
faculty members." 

According lo Dalogh, women face 
many difficulties in the work place thai 
men do not encounter. Among Ihcm 
she lists overt sexual harassment, 



being ignored, being treated unc&lt;]uaUy 
or insupcrior, receiving lower salaries, 
and being just a token minority work- 
er. 

"The competence of women is under- 
valued. They arc pigeon-holed into 
stereotypic roles. There are gender 
role expectations that limit women's 
abilities," Balogh explained. 

As a result, Balogh said that women 
faculty members are subject to "an 
intolerable catch 22. They arc in an 
unpleasant, unenviable position." 

Balogh added that women are chided 
for not being aggressive enough to 
take a stand against unfair treatment. 
But when they do, she said that the 
women are accused of causing trouble. 

Trough Balogh and Kite's extensive 
research, they encountered recurring 
themes of female job discrimination 
and their results matched national sur- 
vey answers. 

According to Dalogh and Kile's sur- 
veys, men think they are more respect- 
ed by students, women have a lower 
base salary, women receive fewer mer- 
it awards, women receive lower leach- 
ing evaluations, and women's research 
is regarded as less credible than men's. 

Kite said that, although a woman's 
performance may be superior lo her 
male collegue's, she is five times more 
likely to be unemployed. To both Kite 
and Balogh, this is more evidence sup- 



OCKAREETA S«ABBA 





PT0KltgQ(5,// 




porting the fact that women iirc being 
discriminated against. 

"Most minority workers are subject 
10 higher standards than the majority," 
Dalogh explained, "hut Ihey are being 
pressured to adopt the behaviors of the 
majority," 

All of these factors, according lo Kiie 
and Balogh, have created a revolving 
door for women faculty members. 
They are recruited for employment, 
but maintaining the job is difficulL 

"All of this creates the erosion of the 
quality of education that students 
receive," Dalogh said. 

According to several 1PF\V faculty 
members, a chilly climate does exist 
on this campus. Donna Middleion, an 
affirmative action/equal opportunity 
administrator, said that she docs 
receive reports of similar types of dis- 
crimination. 

"It's not a lot, but some. We get a lit- 
tle bit of everything," she said. "I'd 
hate 10 bring up instances, though, 
because I don't want to violate the con- 
fidences of anyone who h.TS been 
involved in any of this," Middleton 
said. 

Middleion added that by bringing this 
topic 10 IPFW, "It will hopefully help 
us to explore it and improve."

discriminatory reports. "It definitely 
has happened to me many, many, 
many times. I have also seen it happen 
to other women. I have talked to affir- 
mative action about the harassment to 
try to end it." .she said. 

The faculty member said thai the 
most frustrating part is thai. "It makes 
you nervous, it takes up energy, and 
diverts your energy. You are per- 
ceived as vulnerable. Just because you 
take a stand, though, doesn't mean that 
the actions will stop or they won't 
harass others." 

Kite and Balogh said that by investi- 
gating the subject of the chilly climate 
of women faculty, they arc already 
seeing results. 

"The pennies arc already accumulat- 
ing into small gains," Balogh SEud.

INDIANA - PURDUE STUDENT GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION 




To The student Body: 

As discussed in the last Issue of The Communicator, I want to show you, the 
student body, how much money students provide and where it goes. 1 
elected last spring, by the student body, to the newly created position of Vice 
President of Finance. 

My duties as Vice President of Finance are 
■ Serve as the presiding officer of the Student Service Fee Budget Committee. 

• Make recommendation to all branches of IPSGA In financial matters. 

• Monitor and report on the finances of IPSGA. 

• Make sure that the money is spent to try to improve and enhance the student 
culture on our campus. 

Some of my credentials are as follows: 

• lU senior In Finance and Economics 

• Internship with Equhable Financial Corporation 

• Past president of Sigma Phi Epslion for two years 

• Dean's List 

• Who;s Who of College Students for two years 

The reason I'm sherlng this information with you is to try and change the 
misguided Ideas that student government is full of rebels without a cause. There 
are always problems In any organization, but the goal must be focused on the 
reason why we are here: to get as much accomplished as possible In the limited 
time we have here. Following are the financial workings of the Student 
Government Association In a nutshell.

Volley dons dominate Trojans 



By Joe Heershe 
Sports Editor 

A near capacity crowd of 2650 peo- 
ple were present as ibe IPFW men's 
volleyball Icam defealcd the Universi- 
ty of Soulhem California in [he cbam- 
pionship match of ihe Fort Wayne 
Nalional/Pcpsi Invitational, 

The record crowd al ihc IPFW Ath- 
letic Ccnicr was treated lo a slunning 
move- from -be hind victory in game 
three as the Vollcydons swept the Tro- 
jans in (heir first viclory against USC 
in five ailempts. 

The Volleydons, down 12-7 in game 
Uirec, combined sBong defensive play 
on the front line with well-exccuied, 
sets and kills to defeat the Trojans 16- 
14. Senior Neil Day had two solo 
blocks for scores in the late charge for 
IPFW. 

In game one of Ihe match, two time- 
outs by USC coach Jim McLaughlin 
could not abate the momentum the 
Volleydons gained as they rolled to a 
15-7 win. IPFW coach. Amic Ball 
was not surprised with (he dominating 
play of IPFW in game one. "Volley- 
ball is a game of momentum. We 
thought that we could compete with 
them," Sophomore setter, Lloy Ball 
attributed Ihc strong sLart in game one 
lo being prepared, mentally and physi- 
cally, "We knew we could do it in 
three," he said, "Emotion was running 
high and we had prepared hard. The 
competition in practice is good," 

Game two was highlighted by the 
same solid defensive play that the Vol- 
leydons were able to accomplish in 
game three. Freshman Felipe Ralat 
from Ponce, Puerto Rico, was instm- 
menial in the defense with two solo 
blocks and one clock assist that each 
scored a point in the 15-12 viclory, 

McLaughlin reacted to being swept 
in three games by saying, "We did not

play a good match, Wc have a long 
way to go, and now the team realizes 
it." 

IPFW's Lloy Ball realized that the 
Trojans playing was not typical. "USC 
can play better," he said. 

However, Amie Ball believes that the 
viclory is "significant for volleyball. 
Teams in Ihe Midwest don't beat lop- 
ranked California teams." 

The Volleydons were led by fresh- 
man Craig Collin's 13 kills and Nor- 
man Ahnodovar's 12 kills, Raul Papa- 
leo had 9 kills and Neil Day 7. Lloy 
Ball contributed 45 assists to die Vol- 
leydon's winning effort 

Lloy Ball's 115 assists and four ser- 
vice aces in two games combined with 
his floor leadership against highly tout- 
ed USC. earned him the loumament's 



Most Valuable Player disiinction. 
Joining Lloy Ball on the All Tourna- 
ment team were Norman Almodovar 
and Raul Papaleo. From USC, Jason 
MulhoUand and Dave Derocher joined 
Penn State's Ramon Hernandez and 
Ohio Stale's Mike Terpsha as members 
of the All-Tournament team as well. 

The Trojans were paced by Jason 
Mulholland's 15 kills and Jason 
Perkins' 13 kills, Aaron Boone had 32 
assists for USC, 

IPFW earned a slot in the champi- 
onship match by defeating Penn State 
9-15, 15-10, 15-4, 15-11 on Friday. 
The win marks the second consecutive 
victory for IPFW over Penn State
