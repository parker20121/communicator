Investing for 

the absol u te 

beginner 



By JESSIE RUCKMAN 

ruckjl01Mlptw.Edu 



Idouble-dogdareyou 
to google "investmenls", 
and see how many 
confusing Web sites and 

stams pop up for your 
viewing delight. 

lusi 



Rut along with those 
big names can come a 
lot of information that 
is not for beginners, and 
can serve to confuse the 
novice investor. 

There is a lot of 
techno-investor jargon 
that is as confusing as a 
purple cow i 



c 1 i 



the 



of links, 
andyou'll 
find that 



"Investing can be 
easy if you know 

where to search." 

i ,&gt; — - — = 



crapshoot as to whether 
you're going to invest 
in your future, or get ■ 
taken for a financial ride. 
Solution? 

Be smart. 

There are, of 
course, safer Web sites 
sponsored by mote 
recognized financial 
institutions such as 
Charles Schwab, Merrill 
Lynch, Morgan Stanley, 
and IP Morgan, which 
are investment firms 
that seem to have been 
around since our parents 
were in Pampers. 



suit. 

If you don't want to 
read a bunch of jargon 
where you have to look 
up ever&gt;' term, try more 
beginner-friendly Web 
sites such as http:'/ 
investopedia.com, 
where you can simply 
learn about investing, 
and how to go about it. 

Personally. I hate 
being talked to as 
though I'm an idiot, and 
as though 1 couldn't Rght 
my way out of a paper 
bag without directions. 
Therefore, I like Web 



sites that are designed 
more for beginners. 

For example, try 

this site at http:'/ 

www.investopedia. 

com/articles/ 

younginvestors/07/ 

business-college. asp for 

tips tailored specifically 

to young investors such 

as IPFW students, and 

people who are new to 

the investment scene. 

This site comes 

complete with a 

dictionary, so you can 

conveniently look up 

terms such as "options 

8i futures'", and "technical 

analysis". 

See? Learning how 
to become an educated 
investor can be easy if you 
know where to search, 
and Web sites can actually 
help you to learn about 
securing your future 
without making you feel 
like a complete idiot. 

After all, students 
have plenty of professors, 
families and bosses to 
make us feel that way 
anyway. Impress them 
all by showing off your 
investment knowledge.

Tuesday is [ax day. 
Those IPI^ students 
who have earned enough 
money to attract the 
attention of Uncle Sam 
are probably wondering 
how he is going to spend 
their ta.x dollars. The 
watchdog group Citizens 
Against Government 
Waste (CAGW) may just 
have the answer 

CAGW has released 
the latest edition of 
its annual Pig Book, a 
collection of the year's 
biggest "pork barrel- 
spending projects. 
Pork barrel projects are 
government spending 
that only benefits a 

Congress g member's 

constituents, campaign 
donorsor other special 
interest groups. 

hi the 2008 fiscal year. 
Congress spent billions 
on ridiculous research 
projects. Appropriations 
include * $97,314 

for maple research 
appropriated by Sen. 
Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), 
S742,7&amp;1 for olive fruit 
fly research appropriated 



by Rep. Mike Thompson 
(D-Calif) and almost 
35 million for "wood 
utilization research.'This 
last project was requested 
by 25 members of 
Congress. According 
to (3AGW, "wood 
utilization research" 
includes 'refinement of 
processing technolog&gt;' 
for laminated veneer 
lumber for furniture, 
flooring. and other 
specialty industries." 
Over the last 33 years, 
wood uiilizarion research 
has cost taxpayers over 
S90 million. 

Congress also spent 
money on education. 
House Majority Whip 
lames Clyburn (D- 
S.CI appropriated S3 
million for The First Tee, 
a program designed to 
help young people by 
promoting "character 
development and 

life enhancing values 
through the game of 
golf." 

Another interesting 
educational program is 
the Lobster Institute, "a 
cooperative program of 
research and education 
with the lobster industry 
at the University of 
Maine." Some of the 



Lobster Institute's! 
accomplishments ate 
lobster-flavored dog 
biscuits and http:// 
thelobstcrcam.com, a 
Web site where visitors 
can watch a lobster in 
its tank. (The camera is 
currently broken, I The 
Lobster Institute cost 
taxpayers $188,000. 

Congress also spent 
millions on buildings 
and projects named after 
politicians. including 
neariy $20 million on 
presidential libraries, 
$150,000 to encourage 
celebrations of Abraham 
Lincoln's birthday 

and 51,950,000 for the 
Charles B. Rangel Center 
for Public Service which, 
oddly enough, was 
appropriated by Rep. 
Charles BangeUD-N.Y.). 

Other projects 

include $148,950 for 
something called 

the "Montana Sheep 
Institute". $1.6 million to 
hunt for space aliens and 
$221,490 for a "haunted" 
mansion in Kansas.

"Many persons who have done research on terrorism have suggested that 
democratic stales are more vulnerable to terrorist actions because of limits on the 
security police, protections afforded citizens and others, and the availability of 
fair triaJs for defendants. My frequent co-author and wife. Brenda Lutz, and I have 
begun to more rigorously test this idea. There does seem lo be some support for 
the idea that democratic states are more vulnerable, but it is not overwhelming, 
r and obviously other factors come ~mto play."

A few words with the 

Obama campaign 




By DOUGLAS SCHMIDT ihey 



Monday afiernoon, 
in a roundtable wii)i 
area media, several 
representatives from 
Sen. B a rack Obama's 
campaign spoke lo The 
Communicator about 
Ihe senator's policies and 
plans for the future. 

Chris Hughes, the 
director of online 
organizing for the 
campaign, spoke about 

the importance 

of reaching out 
10 young people 
through I he 

Internet. "One of 
themosl important 
things 1 see is the 

incredible amount 

of enthusiasm that 
young people have for 
this campaign. We have 
750.000 supporters |on 
Facebook.coml , more 
than any other politician 
on the site." 

This campaign 

season, students have 
been using the site to 
create local groups in 
support of their favorite 
candidates, exchange 
viral videos and to 
generally discuss their 
passions and political 
interests. 

Hughes added, 

"Students have had a 
major impact on the 
victories we have had. 
Young people do care 
about the future of 
this country, and they 
overwhelmingly support 
Obama." 

According to Hughes, 
as of Monday, Obama 
has won the majority of 



far. In 
Wisconsin in particular, 
nearly BO percent of the 
vote in districts with 
large college campuses 
went to Obama. 

Carlos Monje, llie 
deputy policy director 
for the campaign, 
mentioned Obama's 
plans to make college 
more affordable. 

Plans include a S-l.OOO 
refundable ta.x credit 
available to students 
or their parents. To be 
eligible, students would

Monje mentioned 
Obama's universal 

healthcare plan, which 
he says would reduce 
costs by S2.500 per family 
and allow young people 
to stay on their parents' 
health insurance plans 
until age 25. 

Universal healthcare 
should not be confiised 
ivith single payer 
healthcare. "Universal

refers to plans in which

plan would include 
government subsidies 
which could be used to 
purchase a government 
health insurance plan or 
a private plan. 

"Single payer" refers 
to systems in which a 
single person or entity, 
usually a government, 
pays healthcare 

expenses. 

Neither system could 
be called "free" as both 
are funded through 
taxes. ' 

Monaje said that

the U.S. has an 
"obligation to

Obama would double

Monaje criticized

Kody Tinnel and 

The IPSGA elections 



Letter to the editor 
By PATRICK DEADY 

I would like to 
disagree with Doug 
Schmidt's commentar&gt;' 
regarding Kody llnnel's 
sophomoric remarks 
concerning Hillary 
Clinton as being akin to 
a "minor scandal." That 
Mr Tinnel's remarks 
were unnecessary is a 
Riven but one should 
look at the totality of Mr. 
linnel's comments as 
to his political beliefs as 
L'xpressed on Facebook 
111 &lt;\ just one small rather 
iiliiiic comment. 

I I would be 
iPiiL-resting to know what 
thf other candidate for 
(he President of IPSGA 
has on bis Facebook/ 
My Space page. 

If one looks at the 
whole of his political 
philosophy, a person 



finds that Kody Tinnel 
expresses a coherent, 
well thought out 
political belief system 
rather amazing for a 
person of his years. That 
the Communicator's 
representative chose to 
emphasize one small 
point Kody Tinnel made 
on Facebook seems to 
indicate the paper's reps 
belief that one candidate 
for President is belter 
than Ihe other, and, 
seemed lo represent an 
endorsement which I 
doubt that you intended. 

It should be noted 
that I serve on IPSGA 
(indirectly) with Mr. 
Tinnel and on another 
student organization 
with him as well and thus 
have a biased opinion. 

One final note, would 
you rather have as a 
student body president 
someone who iscurrently 
hugely involved or a 



person not involved at 
all? It is definitely your 
choice and please vote 
in this weeks IPSGA 
elections. Information 
on where to vote is 
readily available all over 
campus. 

- Patrick Deady 



Laj( week. Tlie 
Communicator 
received an email from 
a female student who 
was concerned about a 
comment Tinnel made 
on racebook. Referring 
lo Sen. Hillary Clinton, 
he wrote that "someone 
needs to rape and kill 
thai stupid b'""." 

Miile it may have 
been a joke, we chose to 
print his words as they 
could affect the choices of 
IPFW's female voters. 

The Communicator 
does not endorse either 
candidate.

Corporate, Ink. 

Body mod culture becomes more accepted 



By JESSIE RUCKMAN 

nickjl01Oipfiv.edu 



Body ink has been 
historically documented 
since around 3000 BCE. 
Even the'iceman", found 
preserved on a mountain 
in 1991 had 57 tattoos 
on different parts of his 
body. 

Tattoos have marked 
cultures all over the 
world, and are not 
native to one region. 
According to hitp:// 
designboom.com. "In 
1891 archaeologists 

discovered the 

mummified remains of 
Amunet, a priestess of 
the goddess Hathor, at 
Thebes who lived some 
time between 2160 EC 
and 1994 BC. 

In short, the an 
of body modification 
has been around for 
eons. But at what point 
did body art become 
unacceptable, and then 
acceptable again? 

This seems to be a 
cyclical issue, and today 
the scales seem to be 
tipping in the favor of 
increased individuality 
and self-expression. 

In today's society, the 
tattoo industry is growing 
rapidly as more people 



express themselves in 
ink. However, there can 
be repercussions in the 
workplace. As a nurse, 
Lisa Omo has refused 
to get the ink she wants 
because her image is at 
stake. 

"I want a small tattoo 
on my wrist, but 1 can't 
because of my job. I feel 
like people wouldn't look 
at me in a professional 
way. I have others, but 
they can be covered up 
very easily at work." 

IPFW alumnus Jason 
McKown agrees, offering 
his own rationale. 

"I don't mind little 
tattoos or piercings, but 
it's when people walk 
around ivith eccentric 
stuff all over their bodies 
that it stans to get a litde 
crazy. I'm ail for ear 
piercings on women, but 
I am conservative." 

Conservative or 

not, tattoo sales have 
increased rapidly in 
recent years, and tattoo 
shops such as Grade 
A Tattoos And Body 
Piercing at 5719 St. foe 
Rd. in Fort Wayne have 
benefited from celebrity 
artists such as Kai Von D. 

Von D's television 
show 'LA Ink' highlights 
Ihe artistry and 
seriousness of body 
modification, and has 



helped to bring body art 
from social fringes to the 
mainstream. 

Grade A typically inlcs 
10-15 people per day. 
and pierces up to 30 to 
40 people per week. "A 
lot of the piercing is done 
between Friday and 
Saturday, and people 
come and go fairly 
quickly," said tattoo artist 
Janel Summers. 

And it's not just 
teenyboppers anymore. 

" We getalot of doctors, 
lawyers and accountants 
who come in for tattoos. 
We are seeing a more 
diverse group, and a 
more professional, older 
crowd," said Summers. 

Think tattoos are a 
forever prospect? "This 
shop performsone lo two 
cover-ups per week." 

In the professional 
arena, Che trend is still 
leaning toward tattoos 
and piercings that can be 
covered by clothing, but 
according to Summers, 
thereisstillabit ofabias 
beti,veen the sexes. 

"It seems like men 
could have full sleeve 
tattoos in the corporate 
world, but women are 
still getting looked down 
on for having multiple 
tattoos. The bias is 
getting better, but we just 
aren't there yet."

"Miami Ink," "LA Ink" and 
A&amp;E's "Inked," tattoo nil- 
lure has reinvenled ilscif 
through America's main- 
stream media, proving 
that tattoos are no longer 
only for rebels and miscre- 
ants but are adorned by 
celebrities, housewives, 
executives and even little 
old ladies. 

According to a 2006 
study in the Journal of 
the American Academy of 
Dermatology, 24 percent 
of Americans between the 
ages of 24 and 50 are tat- 
tooed - that's about one 
in four people. The same 
study also showed that 36 
percent of Americans be- 
t\veen the ages of 18 and 
29 have at least one tat- 
too, and the numbers can 
only be growing. With the 
median age at IPFW being 
25 years old, this means 
that one out of every three 
IPFW students, and quite 
possibly professors, is 
inked. 

This is an indication 
of how prevalent the tat- 
too culture has become 
in recent years. A 1997 ar- 
ticle in USA Today by Ma- 
ria Puente reponed: "The 
once-rebel art of tattoo- 
ing has achieved main- 
stream popularity in 90's 
America. Today's typical 
tattoo studio is clean and 
comfortable with tattoo- 
ing areas that resemble

National Discussion on Global Warming 



By PEALRL PFIESTER 

pep . rfikftyaftoojiom 



As an IPFW Biology 
major. 1 was discuss- 
ing global warming 
with a colleague. Being 
iniegraicd in the sci- 
ence community, global 
warming has never been 
a doubt to me. I figured 
if one student Trom the 
academic field thinks 
' human impact is not a 
causeof global warming, 
then otliers must concur 
with these views. 

I was given Com- 
ments on Global Warm- 
ing, a book by John Cole- 
man, a founder of The 
Weather Channel. I was 
so intrigued with the op- 
ponents of global warm- 
ing that I researched the 
background of Coleman's 
ideas. Most opponents 
get their arguments from 
the film, "Global Warm- 
ing Swindle" which pre- 
miered in March 2007 on 
BBC, 

T h e c o n trove rsy aris es 
from the possible source 
of global warming. Is the 
average global tempera- 
ture rising enough for 
human impact? 

Generally, the "Global 
Warming Swindle" is a 
film against the scienceoF 
global warming. It shows 
shades and mixtures of 
truths and misrepresen- 



tations of scientists. For 
example, it acknowl- 
edge that climate is ever 
changing and therefore 
attributes wanning as 
natural climate variabil- 
ity. However, is only fo- 
cuses on regional climate 
changes, not global. 

Also, offended sci- 
entists such as Dr. Carl 
Wunsch of Physical 
Oceanography at MIT 
were misrepresented in 
the film, Wunsch said, 
"It never occurred to me 
thai I was dealing with 
people who already had 
a reputation for distor- 
tion and exaggeration." 

In addition, the Rim 
used outdated data, 
such as the solar output 
and cosmic ray intensi- 
ties trends. According 
to solar physicist, Dr. 
Mike Lockwood from 
the Rutherford Appleton 
Laboratory in England, 
the film only used data 
up to the 1980's because 
after 1985 the solar flux 
was decreasing to the 
minimum while temper- 
atures kept increasing. 

The film An Incon- 
venient Ttuth was also 
criticized by scientists 
who felt they were mis- 
represented. Dr. Mann 
who famously authored 
the graph in Figure I. has 
Stated that Al Gore used 
the graph incorrectly and 
drew conclusions that 



were unsupported by his 
data. It seems both ex- 
tremist sides of the global 
warming controversy are 
distasteful and biased. 

These scientists feel 
that the media hype and 
political propaganda has 
skewed science. Dissent 
in science is welcomed 
and in fact healthy. The 
purpose of science is 
to gel closer to "truths" 
and this is based on the 
weight of credibility of 
sources. 

Before one takes in 
information and stances, 
society needs to critically 
and skeptically ask for 
credentials and sources. 
Ever&gt;'one cannot become 
doctors in every special- 
ized science so everyone 
needs to make a choice 
on whom to trust for 
information. Based on 
researching this topic, 1 
think there is evidence 
that humans are accel- 
erating global warming 
to the point that natural 
cycles cannot fix or over- 
come our impact. There- 
fore, it is important to 
use renewable and clean 
sources for energy.

Dr. Ahmed Mustafa named 
Students' Choice for 
Teaching Excellence 



By LOUISA DANIELSON 

danl1a02eipfw.cdu 



Going above and be- 
yond the call of duty - 
this is what is the mark of 
an excellent instructor. 

In the past three years 
of the Students' Choice 
for Teaching Excellence, 
those professors nomi- 
nated and chosen for the 
award have demonstrat- 
ed a fantastic work ethic 
and a dedication to the 
well-being of their stu- 
dents. 

This year's winner. 
Ahmed Mustafa, of the 
Biology Department, is 
no exception. During the 
ceremony in which Mus- 
tafa received his award 
last Wednesday, he was 
recognized for being 
-quite possibly the most 



caring and concerned 
professor I have had for a 
class at IPFW." 

He was also noted for 
"always (involving) (lit- 
class, whether it be qiirs- 
tions, or ounvard M,\u- 
ments of informanmi 
pertaining to the (t,iil\ 
lives of his students,..' 

Mustafa's special in- 
terests as a professor 
are pharmacology and 
physiology. "Aquaculiure 
is the fastest growing in- 
dustry in America," he 
noted. 

As pan of his research. 
he works to reduce the 
stress of aquatic animals 
(like lobsters and fish) 
so that they will provide 
more wholesome protein 
for aquaculiure farmers. 

"I've always ivanted 
to help people," he said. 

Since his siblings 
were already involved 



T 




in the leaching profes- 
sion, he decided lo be- 
come a professor so 
that he could both help 
people with his research 
and help students un- 
derstand subjects that 
will later become vital 
life skills in their various

' Mustafe 

From Page 8 



A native of Bangla- 
desh, Muslafa trav- 
eled to Canada in 199 1 
to attend school and 
in 2001 came to the 
United States to teach 
at IPFW. 

"I like to work with 
students...My door is 
always open. Any stu- 
dent working with me 
can come in," he said. 

In order to facili- 
tate student learning, 
he lets students call 



[Mustafa's] teaching phi- 
losophy is "to teach our 
kids and maf(e them ready 
for the real world. " 



him on his cell phone 
or even his home 
phone if they have 
questions pertaining 
to his classes. 

When his students 
do lab work, Mustafa 



says "I don't give them 
instructions - \ work 
vnxh. them. And they 
like it." 

In his classes. Mus- 
tafa likes to use real- 
life questions to help 



students understand 
problems. For his 
pharmacology course, 
he stresses that it is an 
individual's duty to be 
an advocate for the 
patient. 

Citing recent ex- 
amples of medicine 
overdoses or careless 
mistakes that appear 
in the news, Mustafa 
drives home the point 
that careful attention 
must be used when 



working with pa- 
tients. 

His teaching phi- 
losophy is "to teach 
our kids and make 
them ready for the 
real world." 

He wants to pro- 
vide students with a 
strong foundation, to 
inspire curiosity and a 
desire for learning for 
later use in practical 
life. 

"They know that 



I don't teach for the 
money," he said. 

"When I was in 
school," Mustafa not- 
ed of his youth, "I read 
... 'Give a person a fish 
and he will have food 
for a day. Teach him 
how to fish and you 
will feed him for life,"' 

This then has be- 
come his teaching 
principle, both in 
aquaculture and in 
tlie scholastic world.

By MARISHA ZIMMERMAN 

Iprwconvnunlutocorg 



The boys track team competed 
in their first event of the season at 
Manchester College on Saturday, April 
5. The boys competed in the 5,000 meter 
race (that's 3.1 miles) and actually won 
the event. 

First place runner was Hunter Paris 
with a time of 15:41, who defeated 
runners from Tri- State and Huntington 
College in impressive race. 

When asked about the race, Paris 
had this to say: "It's just such a 
blessing. It's a great blessing to be able 
to compete vvith these guys. I just feel 
ver&gt;' encouraged knowing that when 
I'm running, they're running they're 
hardest, too." 

Personal records were also set by all 
the competitors, as well as several odicr 
placements. Runners included Randy 
Quark (16:251, Tony Zimmerman 
(16:34), Ryan Perry (17:12), Wes Kuhn 
(17:18). and Conrad Warden (17:43). 

"It's going to be a good season. 
We've set a lot of personal bests today 
and there are a lot of really good guys

FINISH: Hunter Paris was IPFW's 
top individual runner, 
here. Hunter Paris has been incredibly 
important to our team. He's really been 
important in molding the young ones. " 
Zimmerman said.

outstanding student-athletes. " 

No timetable has been set to begin a 
search for Marsh's replacement.

does think having the NBDL, the feeder system of the NBA, in Fort Wayne is 
great. 

"I thinkitsgreat having a NBDL team there in Fort Wayne. 1 have some friends 
that are involved in the team, and 1 know a couple of the guys that play there, " 
Simon said. 

His former IPFW coach Doug Noll is also an assistant for the D-League's Fon 
Wayne Mad Ants 

So would coming back to Fort Wayne be in Simon's basketball plans? 

"If I ever decided to stay and play in the NBDL, I would love to come play in 
Fort Wayne. Obviously it would be an easy transition forme because I had great 
years there. Its just a matter of weighing if the NBDL is a good fit for me and my 
career." 

Simon shined in the Memorial Coliseum, home of the Mad Ants, He was an 
All-Independent First Team selection as a junior and senior at IPFW after being 
named die Independent Newcomer of the Year after transitioning from being a 
volleyball player at Loyola -Chic ago as a freshman.

l/€ST-0PEfiER-i 

Coming off a high-scoring split Summit League 
opener with Southern Utah, the baseball team is 
back in the midwest for a showdown with Western 
Illinois. With conference play in full swing and a 
looming home schedule, this series will be crucial 
for the Mastodons to get started the right way. 



IPFW Mastodons 

■ They finally have showed 
their power, putting up 35 
runs in their last four games. 
Now, they must keep that 
number consistent.

|**K| ■ They play at Oklahoma 
St. this week, trying to 
rebound from a three loss 
weekend against Oakland. 
They need liitting. 



Brandon Knowling 

■ Gave up eight runs in 1 and 
a third against Southern 
Utah. His ERA is at a season 
high and climbing. 

Jared Davis 

■ Davis went for broke against 
Southern Utah, driving in 6 
runs on 8 hits. Davis also 
scored 5 times. 

Shaun VanDriessche 

■ In 81 trips to the plate, he 
leads IPFW with 22 RBI and , 
is second with 21 hits. SVD \ 
has also gone deep 5 times. 

Kenny Price 

■ Junior outfielder is batting 
.390 and leading the team in 
hits with 32. The Texarkana, 
Texas native is powerful. 

Drew Laidig 

■ Junior infielder from Iowa is 
right behind Price in almost 
every catagory and has 17 
RBI with 27 hits. 




Coach Billy Gernon's Impact 

- Gernon has to keep his pitchers calm during 
this series. Yeah, the offense scored a lot of 
runs against Southern Utah, p- 
but the team gave up a lot too. [ 
Giving up eight in an inning is 
pretty much unacceptable. Keep 
them calm or puli them out is 
Gernon's only option in Illinois. 




MIVA wrapped with pair of critical games 

■ Struggling to stay above .500, volleyball team tops Mercyhurst and Lewis 



By DAN VANCE 

da n . ■anceOfrmthilt publlulldis.net 

Coach Amie Ball 
desperatly needed some 
wins. And he needed his 
seniors to step up and 
deliver those. 

One year after a 
National Title Game 
apperance, IPFW has 
struggled to stay above 
.5U0 all season long 
and closed out their 
conference schedule 
last weekend with 
Mercyhurst and the I5lh- 
ranked Lewis Flyers. 

On Friday night, 
the Mastodons swept 
Mercyhurst 30-16, 30-21, 
30-24 at Gates. 

Seniors Jason YhosI 



and losh Stewart each 
had 11 kills to lead the 
Mastodons and Stewart 
hit ,733 on the night. 

IPFW hit a combined 
.425 in the match. 

Senior Graydon 

Ainsworth returned to 
the sener role with 44 

On Saturday, the 
nationally ranked Lewis 
Flyers were shocked in 
four games; 30-27. 30-24, 
27-30 and 30-22. 

The Mastodons were 
ahead for most of the 
match, leaving the Flyers 
ofiem confused and 
arguemeniaiive. 

All of the arguing 
did not help however 
as the Mastodons took 



every advantage of the 
flustered Flyers. 

Yhost came on strong 
with 20 kills and 13 digs 
along with three service 
aces and even a couple 
of assists. 

Quiet early, senior CJ. 
Macias knocked down 16 
balls and helped out on 
defense with eight digs 
once Lewis picked up on 
Yhost's hitting patterns. 

Keeping IPFW strong 
and balanced. Brock 
Ullrich had 14 kills. 

It was the best overall 
match in quite sometime 
for the IPFW hitlers 
as they stayed very 
balanced. Stewart added 
seven kills, freshman 
Oliver Kook put down 



four balls and Ainsworth 
had three kills. 

Ainsworth also was 
flying all over the court 
after loose balls, picking 
up 55 assists, eight digs 
and three block assists. 

Ball did not go deep 
on his bench in the 
match, only playing Dan 
McNerney and Daryl 
Shank off the bench. 

Yhost's xvio night 
performance earned him 
MfVA Player of the Week 
honors for the second 
time in 2008. 

The Mastodons 

improved to 12-11 on the 
year. A final conference 
game, a makeup with 
Ohio State, occurcd on 
Tuesday night.
