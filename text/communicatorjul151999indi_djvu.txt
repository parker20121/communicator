IPFW, Three Rivers Festival team 
up for live music at ice cream social 



by Adam Taylor. 
Edilor 



The Alumni Association treated the 
community last Monday to an ice cream 
social and performance by the Fort Wayne 
Community Band. 

The event was part of the annual Three 






Rivers Festival which began last Friday and 
continues through Saturday. July 17. 

The Fort Wayne Community Band. 75 
people strong, usually charges S500 for 
performances such as this. 

However, their performance at the ice 
cream social was strictly on a volunteer 
basis. 

As a result, anyone from the communi- 
ty was able to come out and listen to the 
band free of charge. 

Twelve alumni volunteers from the 
community came out to help scoop ice 
cream, which was fifty cents a scoop. 

Alumni didn't have to pay anything, 
though, because they were given a 
coupon in the mail that gave them free 
ice cream at the social. 

Children were given a bonus as volun- 
teers passed out free IPFW balloons dur- 
ing the performance. 

The event began a little after 6:30 p.m. 
behind the Student Union building. 

It was only scheduled to last until 8 
p.m., but the band decided to keep play- 
ing for an additional 20 minutes. 

According to Jennifer Bosk, director of 
Alumni Services, everyone seemed to be 
having a good time. 

"It was a perfect evening," Bosk said. 
"The weather was very cooperative. The 
crowd is always a delight." 

Bosk said this isn't the first year in 
which they have had the ice cream social, 
in fact, it has been going on for quite 
some time. "We've been doing it for a 
multitude of years," she said. "It all 
depends on the weather each tii.ie." 

Following this year's performance, 
Alumni Services will be passing control 
of the social over to University Relations 
to be used as a POPS, or Performance on 
the Plaza Series, event. POPS is a sum- 
mertime series that has outdoor perfor- 
mances on campus once a month to 
entertain the community. 
"It will fit very well in the POPS series,"

New tennis courts finally 
with addition of lights for 



by Adam Taylor. 
Edilor 



Those wishing to play 
night tennis on campus can 
now do so, according to the 
Physical Plant. 

Dave Danielson. director 
of the Physical Plant, said the 
relocation of the tennis courts; 



due to the building of the new 
parking garage, has finally 
been completed with the addi- 
tion of lights to aid in playing 
at night. 

"The new tennis courts 
were finished in March of 
1999," Danielson said. "These 
have lights; the old ones did 
not." 

Danielson said this was a 
part of the parking garage pro- 
ject and that the courts were 



complete 
night use 

moved from their old location 
to their new spot north of the 
baseball field on Broyles Drive. 

The project took a year to 
complete, but as a result, there 
are six new tennis courts on 
campus that are open for stu- 
dents to use. 

The final step in the pro- 
ject was aiming the lights and 
getting the electricity going, 
which was completed six weeks 
ago, Danielson said. 




Two students take advantage ot ample night lighting and play a quick game of tennis. The reloca- 
tion of the tennis courts was the tinal stage in completing the new parking garage and provided the 
opportunity to Install lights lor night play. 



Students, faculty invited to 'kick their butts goodbye' 



by CarrieAnne Leathers, 
News Editor 



As part of an effort to reduce the number 
of smokers at IPFW, Smoke-free Indiana and 
IPFW will be hosting "Kick Your Butt Goodbye" 
on Wednesday, July 28, from 4-7 p.m. 

The event will be held in the commons 
area between Walb Union and the Helmke 
Library. D.J. Hurricane of HOT 107.9 will be 
broadcasting live. 

"Smoke-free Indiana was asked to create a 



program to lower the smoking rate on campus 
and also to bring the issue of smoking to the 
attention of incoming freshman," said Jason 
Melton, in charge of Smoke-free Indiana's "Kick 
Your Butt Goodbye" program. 

The event is designed to help educate stu- 
dents and faculty about smoking and to pro- 
vide them with support and suggestions for 
quitting. 

Representatives from the American Cancer 
Society and pharmaceutical companies will be 
present to answer questions and discuss medi- 
cines which can help ease the difficulty of 



in this event, as well as incoming students pre- 
sent for SOAR." Melton said. "We want to edu- 
cate everyone that uses the campus about the 
effects of smoking." 

Besides planning this event, Melton has 
been working throughout the summer to deter- 
mine the current number of smokers at IPFW, 
assess students' general knowledge about 
smoking, and examine problems that might be 
related to smoking on campus. 

Through surveying, Melton found that 83 
percent of students had encountered second- 
hand smoke at least once at a doorway on cam- 
pus. If ashtrays are moved at least 20 feet away 
from doorways, as is required by the new 



smoking ordinance for Fort Wayne, this prob- 
lem could be reduced. 

"Smoke-free Indiana wants to bring IPFW 
into compliance with the law," Melton said. 

"Kick Your Butt Goodbye" will give smok- 
ers a solid quitting date according to Judy 
Tillapaugh, IPFW fitness and wellness 
coordinator. 

"This will be a community-quit-smoking 
day," Tillapaugh said. 

D.J. Hurricane is also hoping to quit smok- 
ing and, according to Melton, will be discussing 
his attempt to quit during the event. 

Free refreshments will also be available. 



Summer Days in the Shade 




Despite the recent weather being close to that In Atrlca, this Texas-bom cheetah still prelers to 
take it easy In the shade. For more from the Fort Wayne Children's Zoo, see page 4. 



Knowledge of campus emergency 
procedures for 
severe weather 
important 



Dangerous thunderstorms and torna- 
does are common in Indiana this time of 
the year and the IPFW Police and Safety 
Department wants to be certain that every- 
one on campus is aware of how warnings 
for these types of weather sound and what 
safety procedures should be followed in 
the event of a serious storm. 

When it is certain that a tornado or 
severe weather could impact IPFW. the 
campus alarm system is activated. 

The IPFW tornado alarms can be iden- 
tified by a loud pulsing horn in the build- 
ings. They will go on and off every several 
seconds. The fire alarms are continuous. 

If the IPFW tornado alarms begin 
sounding, it is important to lake the fol- 
lowing actions: 

-Classes should cease immediately. 

-Student and faculty should shut off 
lab equipment for which they are responsi- 
ble and proceed to the nearest shelter 
area. 

"Remember, each classroom should 
have information posted on what to do in 
case of a tornado. Students and visitors on 
campus should take a minute and read 
these. The most direct exit and common 
shelter area should be posted there. 
Usually the lower level, center area of the 
building that is away from outside walls 
and windows serves as the shelter area," 
said Lauren DenHartog, chief of Police and 
Safety. 




All university busi- 
ness and activities, 
except for emergency ser- 
vices, will terminate. 
Students, staff and faculty 
should proceed to the clos- 
st sheltered area until the 
danger has passed. In such 
severe weather conditions, Allen 
County's own warning system may also be 
activated. 

The warning system in Allen County is 
sounded whenever severe weather is emi- 
nent anywhere within the county. The 
university police closely monitor weather 
and police channels, especially if the alarm 
has been sounded. 

"We've got a better understanding of 
how the alarms in Allen County work. We 
know a little better now how and where to 
get up to the minute information. The 
communication is better between us and 
the local entity that sets off the Allen 
County tornado alarms," DenHartog said. 

IPFW's complete Emergency Policies 
and Procedures can be found in IPFW's 
web pages under Police and Safety.

Are governments handling Internet regulation well enough? 



WHAT WE THINK: The Internet needs to be regu- 
lated on an international level, not a national one. 



WHAT DO YOU THINK? Send your e-mail response 
to stupaper@holmes.iptw.edu or a letter to Walb 215. 




The Internet has become 
an easily accessible database 
for many homes in America. 

With just a touch of the 
mouse pointer, you can find 
out just about anything from 
the latest news to your 
favorite soap opera, basically 
anything the imagination can 
conjure up. 

You can also use the 
Internet as a personal shop- 
ping mall, often finding that 
purchasing things on the 
Internet can not only be con- 
venient, but also cheaper in 
some cases. 

Such conveniences as 
being able to do some of your 
shopping at home more inex- 
pensively and being able to 
find good, reliable informa- 
tion for research papers are 
always good, in our opinion. 

Included among those 
things on the Internet that 
make life easier, however, are 
things that can not only cor- 
rupt the weak-minded but also 
things that are flat out illegal. 

Some good examples of 
this are hate groups that are 
given a soapbox In cyberspace 
to speak their supremacist 
views and cult members that 
are given a convenient way to 
recruit members, all at the 
touch of a mouse pointer. 

Other topics that are fre- 
quently dealt with on the 
Internet are how to build 
bombs, how to "hack" into 
people's computers and other 
terrorist activities, all of which 
can be found on web pages 
from all over the world. 

Millions of pornographic 
pictures and movies are also 



available with very little time 
being spent in finding them 
and weak guards against the 
distribution of those files to 
minors. 

Now, the latest craze has 
become mp3's, which are CD 
quality sound files that have 
been copied onto a computer 
via a sound recorder. 

Legally, these files are 
only allowed to be 15 seconds 
long. 

However, due to the fact 
that the Internet is a global 
communication network 
(allowing people in China to 



The only 
good is 
knowledge 
and the only 
evil is 
ignorance. 

Socrates 



talk to people In the U.S. 
almost for free), this law is 
very difficult to enforce. 

One ramification of not 
being able to regulate the 
Internet thoroughly is that the 
CD Industry (and music indus- 



try in general) has suffered 
financially since the advent of 
this new technology. 

The same situation can be 
found in the distribution of 
"warez," or pirated computer 
software, which Is annually 
costing game designers quite a 
large sum of money as well. 

With so many violations 
of civil liberties, copyright 
codes and child pornography 
laws, one would think that 
government officials would re- 
think how they handle the 
illegal activities occurring on 
the Internet. 

However, only a small 
effort has been made to do so. 

Currently, the FBI is the 
major enforcer of laws on the 
Internet. 

However, the FBI can only 
efficiently enforce these laws 
in the United States. 

Besides, the FBI has 
domestic laws that need to be 
enforced as well. 

What we would like to see 
happen is for more attention 
to be paid to the regulation of 
the Internet on a global, leg- 
islative level. 

Whether it be through 
treaties or through the estab- 
lishment of a global Internet 
council, we feel that Internet 
users would be belter served 
if more attention would be 
directed towards this In the 
immediate future. 

There needs to be some 
sort of agreement made 
between national governments 
about the use of the Internet. 

Without one, all of these 
crimes we've mentioned are 
bound to keep happening. 



I'd gladly pay tomorrow for a hamburger today 

by Darci L. Denton, Staff Writer 



It was the very first day of class- 
es during the 1999 spring semester. I 
walked into my psychology class and 
there they were. They were every- 
where. 

At first I couldn't believe what I 
was seeing: Every seat in the room 
held a pamphlet containing a credit 
card application. 

I can't begin to tell you how 
angry 1 was. Were students here to 
get an education or to create debts 
(on top of school loans) that are 
nearly impossible to pay off? Was 
the university making a profit by 
allowing these companies to adver- 
tise on campus? 

The beginning of the semester 
seemed to be a prime time for this 
particular angle of "legal loan shark- 
ing." Later in the semester, though, 
these same companies resorted to 
forms of bribery. 

Little stations were set up 
around campus offering free t-shirts 
(bearing advertisements for 
Mastercard, Visa, Discover....) to any- 
one willing to fill out a credit card 
application. 

The last rime I checked, a decent 
i-shirt could be purchased for about 
twenty bucks. By the time you make 
a payment or two on your new card, 
you end up paying for that t-shlrt 
yourself. What I don't understand Is 
why anyone would want to wear a 
piece of clothing advertising for a 
company that rips him off of his 
hard-earned cash. 

Why not wear a t-shirt advertis- 
ing for the IRS or the gas company? 
In sum, nothing in life is free and 
some things in life will give you a 
run for your money if you let them. 

1 expect that most of you read- 
ing this already have, or will soon 
have, a credit card of your own. It 
would be foolish of me, then, to try 
and sway you away from the tempt- 
ing world of plastic cash. 

Anyway, it seems to me that 
credit cards have become a neces- 
sary evil. We all know it's a rip-off, 
but we all have them anyway and 
most of us use them, at least now 
and then, when we know we really 
shouldn't 

We live in an economy where 
many things are not readily available 
to us without the use of credit. 

Our government tells us again 
and again that wages are up, loan 
rates are down, and that the country 
Is thriving economically. If this is 
true, then why are most Americans 
up to their necks In debt? 

If the economy is doing so well, 
why do we need so much credit? The 
country was doing well in the fifties 
and we know this because it took 
only one income to care for a family 
and it was being done just fine with- 
out the use of credit cards. 

Many of you may wonder, after 



reading this, whether or not 1 myself 
use credit cards. The answer is, "yes, 
I too owe a small part of my soul to 
the company store." 

Having had an assortment of 
credit cards over the years, I believe 
I have a fairly good understanding of 
just how difficult and slow the credit 
card repayment process is. It didn't 
take too awfully long for me to 
decide that I needed to learn to curb 
my spending when It came to credit 
cards. 

It's too easy to spend with plas- 
tic today when later you have to 
back up your debt with cold, hard 
cash. 

Although I don't agree with 
advertising for credit cards on cam- 
pus, I realize that most of you read- 
ing this, like other Americans, will be 
in debt for one thing or another for 
most of the rest of your life. 

Bearing this in mind, it would 
do you much justice to pay close 
attention to all terms and agree- 
ments when accepting a new credit 
card. Like any other legal commit- 
ment, what's hidden in the fine print 
may surprise you. 

I have learned over the years 
that fine print usually means bad 
news concerning terms and condi- 
tions for the borrower. 

Interest rates and hidden fees 
can make repaying credit card debt 
seem like an endless battle. 

Beware of extremely low intro- 
ductory rates, especially those below 
7.9 percent. These companies are 
famous for 3.9 to 5.9 percent intro- 
ductory rates that last for six months 
or less and then balloon to 12.9 per- 
cent or higher. Don't expect to be 
notified of any changes concerning 
your interest rate; it's up to you to 
pay close attention to your monthly 
bill (or statement) and to request a 
lower rate If you ask nicely and 
maybe mention moving your debt to 
another card. 

Since The Communicator cannot 
possibly afford me enough space to 
give you all of the information you 
should have concerning credit cards, 
I'll offer you, in the space I have 
remaining, what I have found to be 
the most important of the things 1 
have learned. 

1 . If you have a 
major credit card and 
are planning a trip via 
boat, train, plane, etc., 
charge your ticket to 
the card that offers 
the best death benefit. 
This may sound mor- 
bid, but it is realistic 
thinking. 

If possible, pay 
the bill off as soon as 
you receive it. 

2 . It is nearly 
impossible today to 



rent a car without a major credit 
card. The car rental agency will offer 
: coverage on the rental 



Before you purchase this cover- 
age (and preferably before you ever 
get to the rental agency!), check your 
personal automobile policy to see if 
you are already covered to drive 
another car. 

You many not need the extra 
coverage offered by the rental 
agency. If you usually drive an 80s 
station wagon and are planning to 
rent an expensive car, you may want 
to purchase the extra coverage. 

The point is that you should 
know your personal insurance situa- 
tion before you set off to rent a car. 

3. Before you buy the "lost or 
stolen" coverage from the credit card 
company, check your renter's or 
home owner's insurance policy; 
many insurance companies offer this 
coverage at a much lower rate and 
you may already be covered. 

If you aren't covered, have them 
quote you a price and then check it 
against the credit card company's 
offer. I'm betting on the insurance 
companies for the lowest rates. 

4 . Don't ever miss a payment if 
you don't have to. More times than 
not, you will lose your current inter- 
est rate to one even higher, not to 
mention the late fees that they tack 
on to your balance. 

It makes no difference whether 
or not you've been with a company 
for years and never missed a pay- 
ment. These creditors are some of 
the more unforgiving of the lot. 

5. If you have a department 
store credit card and you must use 
it, I implore you to pay it off as soon 
as possible. If you can, don't ever 
charge more than you can pay off in 
one payment. 

These cards have the worst 
interest rates yet. Normal rates on 
department store credit cards are 
comparable to the rates for a cash 
advance on your major credit card. 
Some department stores offer com- 
petitive rates for health and life 
insurance to card holders. 

Credit card debt has been the 
cause of much financial disarray in 



this country for the past decade or debt is a privilege that I think we can 

so. all do without. 

Many bankruptcies have been Just do yourselves a favor and 

filed due to credit card ignorance educate yourselves about the "finan- 

and misuse. Most of us are or will be cial (not so free) freeway" of which

The poodle: more than a lap dog 



Drivers warned to 
watch for medics 

by Kathy Delagrange, Copy Editor 



Flashing lights. Wailing 
sirens. To most people, lights 
and sirens mean that emer- 
gency personnel are 
approaching. 

However, there are some 
citizens in Fort Wayne who 
choose to disregard these 
warnings. Unfortunately these 
people fail to realize that they 
may be slowing a vehicle 
from reaching or transport- nj 
ing a patient or that ^, \ 
they may even be 
involved in a 
accident due to 
Irresponsible 
driving. 

Having 
taken an 

emergency 
medical tech- 
nician training 
course, I know 
all too well the 
frustration that 
ambulance drivers 
experience while nav 
igating throughout 
traffic. 

From the time an ambu- 
lance is dispatched to the time 
the patient reaches a hospital 
should not exceed one hour. 
An hour may seem like plenty 
of time, however one must 
consider the time it takes to 
reach the patient, provide nec- 
essary care and then travel to 
the hospital. All things consid- 
ered, emergency personnel 
are expected to arrive at the 




scene In less than ten minutes. 
Paramedics, police and 
firefighters do not need the 
added concern of trying to 
anticipate the actions of every 
driver on the road. 

Once one hears sirens or 

sees flashing lights, the driver 

should pull to the side of the 

road and stop. One may need 

to observe the other lanes of 

traffic in order to facilitate 

the formation of a 

clear lane. 

Simply slowing 
down is not 
enough; a slow 
moving vehi- 
cle can be as 
much of a 
hazard as a 
vehicle going 
the speed 
limit. 

1 do realize 
that it can be 
ery difficult to 
hear sirens when the 
radio and the air condi- 
tioner are on, however this is 
part of the reason why these 
vehicles also have lights as an 
additional method of attract- 
ing attention. 

With the Three Rivers 
Festival In full swing, the 
streets of Fort Wayne are more 
congested than usual. Please 
drive responsibly. You never 
know when your life or the 
life of a loved one may 
depend on it.

The poodle-a liny ball of fluff usually 
owned by old ladles. The poodle serves as a 
lap dog and it constantly yaps. This image 
of the poodle has been depicted in America 
for years. 

I have lived around poodles since the 
day 1 was bom and find this image to be an 
insult to such fine animals. 

First of all, poodles are not found in 
one size. They are found in three sizes, toy, 
miniature and standard. According to the 
American Kennel Club (AKC) a toy poodle is 
ten inches or less at the highest point of the 
shoulders, a miniature poodle is fifteen 
inches or less at the highest point of the 
shoulders and the standard poodle is over 
fifteen inches at the highest point of the 
shoulders. 

According to the AKC, the poodle origi- 
nated in Germany and is known as the 
"pudel," meaning puddle dog or one that likes splashing. In 
France it is known as the "caniche" or duck dog 

The "French" poodle ("French" because it is the nation- 
al dog of France), according to the American Poodle Club, is 
one of the most intelligent types of dogs. They are water 
dogs, can be taught many tricks and are very faithful to 
their masters. In Germany and France they were used for 
retrieving waterfowl. 

Poodles first came to North America in 1600, to hunt, 
you guessed it. waterfowl. By the late 1890s the waterfowl 
population had dropped and in 1918. the Federal Migratory 
Bird Treaty Act was passed. This treaty put restrictions on 
hunting. 

This led to the end of the poodle's official hunting days. 
Today the poodle, by AKC standards, has been placed in the 
non-sporting category. They are mainly used in dog shows 
and for pets. The "big hair" clips (hairstyles) lnat poodles in 
the movies or in the dog shows sport, were, believe it or not, 
created to help the dog maneuver faster in the water 

1 can attest to some of these facts. My family lives on a 
lake which serves as their backyard. Their two standard poo- 
dles can never seem to stay out of the water. 

The younger dog is constantly begging you to play fetch 
with him. He is not satisfied unless something is thrown into 
the water. He is happy because he gets to go swimming and 
retrieving at the same lime. 

Whenever there are ducks near the house, the dogs go 
nuts if they are inside and of course, they chase them if they 
are outside. 

Most of all, they are obedient. There is no need for a 
leash while walking through the park. The dogs just walk 
beside you without a care in the world. A leash is only need- 
ed in case another animal is seen, but even then a harsh 
tone of voice is all that is needed most of the time. 

I feel these fancy haircuts are only for show. It is very 
time consuming to keep up such styles and the dogs can 
make a' mess. of themselves in a second. I've seen my family's 





dogs happily '.prante' around after having a bath/but it 



doesn't last long. 

Do you know anyone who plays volleyball with their 
hair put up in a French twist? 

Finally, the AKC accurately described the most defining 
characteristic of this breed: a poodle thinks it is a human. 

These dogs howl when they are left out of something. 
They know when a person is leaving and they can never get 
enough attention. This is an excellent trait to find in any 
dog. 

The usual reaction 1 get when I tell people I live 
around poodles is, "Ahh, you have one of those fancy sman- 
cy dogs, don't want them to get their feel dirty." 

I hope that all of you now realize this stereotype just 
isn't true. If any of you are interested in purchasing a poo- 
dle, I recommend that you don't buy it from a pet store. 
Those animals usually come from a puppy mill and may 
have all sorts of problems such as runny eyes, a bad tem- 
perament or even worms. 

The best place to purchase a poodle Is from a dog 
breeder whose animals are AKC registered. If you want one 
for a pet, it is cheaper to buy one with a slight defect such as 
white spots on the coat, the wrong size feet or something of 
that nature. 

These defects don't affect the personality or health of 
the dog; they are defects 
by AKC standards. In other 
words, the poodle is not 
physically "perfect" 
enough to ever succeed in 
a dog show. 

Prices will vary 
according to the breeder. A 
"defective" dog will run 
about S300 at most. 

If you ever own a poo- 
dle, you will have a faith- 
'ful, obedient Companion.

Fort Wayne Children's Zoo provides excellent summer entertainment 




California sea lions live in rocky areas

PhcJoMAflamTlyW EWoi 

from the coasts of Mexico fo Northern California. Currently, "The Heart of 
raise money for a new sea lion exhibit. 



by Mishanna Wood, 
Managing Editor 

The summer season usually 
brings warm temperatures and out- 
door activities such as attending fes- 
tivals, swimming, cooking out or vis- 
iting the zoo. 

The Fort Wayne Children's Zoo 
has been around for approximately 
30 years and it is open to the public 
April through October. During the 
winter months, the animals that 
can't stand the cold stay at the zoo 
in barns or cages. For example, the 
Red Panda is used to the cold 
because its home is in the mountains 
of China, but the kangaroos need a 
barn because they are used to 
warmer temperatures. 

All in all, the zoo serves as a 
place to conserve animals and edu- 
cate people about wildlife. 

"People don't realize that zoos 
work closely with other zoos 
throughout "the state and Country. 
We share animals, We don't take 



them out of the wild. Most zoos are 
nonprofit. They are for the better- 
ment of the animals, especially 
endangered species," said Karen 
Harrington, the education curator 
for the Ft. Wayne Zoo. 

According to Warren Pryor, 
curator for the central and 
Australian sections, the Fort Wayne 
Zoo is constantly being upgraded. 

The newest addition to the zoo 
is the Mew Building. The building 
houses two dozen birds, most of 
which are raptors. Most visitors will 
not notice the structure because it 
was made to blend in with older 
buildings. 

The birds such as hawks, owls 
and crows are used in the Wild 
Wings shows, which run for 20 min- 
utes, three times a day, seven days a 
week. The shows are intended to 
inform (he public about birds of 
prey and how to conserve them, said 
Pryor. 

The raptors are only one of 
many animals living at the zoo. 



There are animals from various 
parts of the world. Each exhibit has 
information about almost every ani- 
mal it contains. 

A miniature Indonesian rain 
forest is kept in a greenhouse area. 
The forest, filled with a variety of 
luscious plants, is very moist and in 
the summer, the humidity and heat 
are no lower than 80 degrees. 
According to Pryor this temperature 
must be maintained in order for the 
seven species of Indonesian butter- 
files to remain active. If the tempera- 
ture were not stable, the butterflies 
would sit around all day. 

The Indonesian area also has 
orangutans, tigers and a variety of 
birds and monkeys. According to a 
sign posted in the Indonesian exhib- 
it, for every acre of rain forest there 
are 80 tree animals compared to 15 
tree animals per acre in North 
American forests. 

Another part of the zoo is 22 
acres of the African Veldt. It is home 
to reticulated giraffes, flamingos, 



grants zebras, ostriches, 
cheetahs and three species 
of antelope, to name a few. 

The veldt Is a large 
grassy area with a water 
hole and trees. One can 
walk around the veldt or 
take a safari ride through 
the veldt. 

Australian Adventure 
is the home for animals 
such as dingos, eastern 
gray kangaroos and 
Tasmanian devils. There is 
also a night life version of 
Australia which houses bats 
and other evening crea- 
tures. A ride for this por- 
tion of the zoo is available 
via a log ride. 

The center zoo consists 
of a large pond for ducks 
and separate areas for 
monkeys and alligators. A 
contact area is also avail- 
able. There are small 
indoor exhibits and rides 
throughout the zoo. 

"I like working with all 
types of people. The volun- 
teers enjoy it the most 
when they see a child 
learning something new by 
the expression on their 
face," said Karen Lemire, 
volunteer and events coor- 
dinator of the Fort Wayne 
Zoo. 

There are so many creatures in 
the zoo that it would be Impossible 
to write about them all. 

However, Pryor has found the 
Tasmanian devil to be one of the 
more interesting animals at the Fort 
Wayne Zoo. According to Pryor, 
there are twelve Tasmanian devils in 
North America and Fort Wayne has 
three. These marsupials only live on 
the island of Tasmania, which is 
about the size of Indiana and is 
located near Australia. They live

These giraffes have 18-inch tongues, useful In 
pulling leaves off of trees. 



guins and snow leopards are some of 
the other endangered species the 
zoo is trying to help. 

The zoo has many special 
events for children and fundraisers. 
According to Pryor, there are 
approximately 500,000 visitors who 
are the main income for the zoo. 

However, currently there is a 
fundraiser called "The Heart of the 
Zoo" to build a new sea lion exhibit 
and repair various parts of the zoo. 
Five million dollars will be necessary 



about four years in the wild and up in order to achieve a new sea lion 
area and renovate the zoo. 

On Wednesday, July 21, the zoo 
will be having a behind the scenes 



ight years in captivity. 

The catch about these critters is 
that they have only been bred in 
captivity in Australia. The zoo has 
been working almost ten years to 
have a baby devil. Devils only ovu- 
late once a year and they can only 
reproduce at age two or three. 

The Australian devil is only one 
of the animals that the zoo is trying 
to protect. Orangutans, African pen- 



day from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Visitors 
will have the opportunity to see how 
the animals are fed, where they stay 
in the winter and now divers get in 
to the aquarium, 

If one would like to make a 
donation or learn about the zoo, flail

'Rushmore' and 'American Pie' 
have different flavors of funny 



by Eric Baus, 
Staff Writer 



Ever since "Rushmore" 
came out several months ago, 
friends of mine have been rec- 
ommending it as the funniest 
thing since "There's 
Something About Mary." 

When it finally came out 
on video, I was excited to see 
what everyone was talking 
about. 

I expected the typical Bill 
Murray goofball, over-the-top 
comedy a la "Stripes" or 
"Ghostbusters." 

To my surprise. I found 
"Rushmore" to be a subtle and 
well-written story that also 
happened to be incredibly 
funny. 

"Rushmore" is the story 
of 15-year-old prep-school 
student Max Fischer's doomed 
love for a new teacher. 

Much like the classic 
"Harold and Maude," 
"Rushmore" is the story of 
awkward age-mismatched love 
and the difficulties of coping 
with loss and death. 

Although this may not 
sound like a recipe for belly 
laughs, the deadpan perfor- 
mance by Murray and the 
faked confidence and teen- 
angst of Max work perfectly 
together. 

It is difficult to translate 
the humor to print because so 



many of the laughs come from 
watching incredibly dorky, yet 
sincere Max cope with the 
destruction of his fragile 
world. 

Most of the jokes are sub- 
tle and visual, like Murray in 
sagging Budweiscr swimming 
trunks doing a depressed can- 
nonball at his son's birthday 
party or Max lighting his 
teacher's cigarette with an oh- 
so-debonair touch. 

Trust me, it pays off when 
you see it. 

Most good comedies 
("Austin Powers," for example) 
boil down to about four or five 
really memorable gags you 
could tell like jokes to some- 
one in the absence of a visual 
aid. 

Great comedies like 
"Rushmore" are inexplicably 
and irreducibly funny the 
whole way through. 

Go rent "Rushmore." It is 
worth your three dollars! 

Unlike "Rushmore," the 
new release, "American Pie," is 
anything but subtle and 
understated. 

This is a film in the 'I 
can't believe they showed 
that' school of comedy. 

Admittedly, I didn't like 
the movie when it began. 

It seemed like it was going 
to be yet another teenage sex 
comedy with obligatory nude 
scenes and oversexed, drunk- 



en teenagers. 

Although I wasn't far off 
the mark in my plot assess- 
ment, I found myself sucked 
in. 

Reviewing this film is dif- 
ficult because I don't want to 
give away it' surprises and 
also because many of the best 
parts are too vulgar to print. 

I can't even explain the 
title's significance without 
overstepping the boundaries 
of good taste. 

Imagine the humor of 
"South Park" with the cast of 
"Dawson's Creek" and you 
have a pretty good Idea of 
what to expect. 

What saves "American 
Pie" are the surprises and plot 
twists, generally absent from 
the cliche-ridden genre of 
"teen movies." 

This is not a cinema clas- 
sic nor is it the most morally 
instructive thing I've ever 
seen, but it does the job and 
gets some laughs. 

I'd recommend it purely 
for the auto-erotic apple pie 
scene. 

Incidentally, bring a valid 
form of identification to the 
theater because they are card- 
ing everyone who sees it. 

The mentality of the char- 
acters may be 15 years old but 
the real under 17 crowd are 
out of luck until it comes out 
on video. 




'The General's Daughter' 
falls short of a fine hour 



by Nancy Simmonds, 
Guest Writer 

The lushly beautiful 
and steaming Georgia sets of 
"The General's Daughter" 
frame more than a murder 
mystery in this film of military 
life and death. 

The dark interiors, 
shadows and night scenes con- 
ceal a rotten and smoldering 
attitude toward women in the 
military. 

The all-star cast of 
John Travolta, James 
Cromwell, Timothy Hutton 
and James Woods may be 
enthusiastic about the psycho- 
logical motivations of their 
characters and the intellectual 
combat of their dialogue, but 
what the audience will remem- 
ber by the closing scenes Is the 
way the single female military 
personnel is presented. 

She Is physically 
attractive to the major stars, 
sexually unbalanced in part- 
nering dozens of soldiers in S 
&amp; M fashion, completely 
worthless as an individual to 
most of the rest of the charac- 
ters and repeatedly raped 
because she "deserved" or 



"desired" it. 

Nelson DeMille admitted 
that he wrote the novel on 
which this movie is based in 
response to the increased visi- 
bility of women in Desert 
Storm. 

What a statement! 

The story line tries to jus- 
tify the cover-ups of the 
crimes as the sacrifice of a few 
for the benefit of many. 

It doesn't make any sense 
and it Is a shame that director 
Simon West and producer 
Mace Neufeld thought they 
could capitalize on DeMille's 
scorn. 

This negative attitude is 
well disguised in rich and lus- 
cious sets, hidden beneath a 
haunting and stimulating 
score, and trie k-mirro red away 
by the biting dialogue between 
Travolta as Paul Breener, mili- 
tary criminal investigator, and 
James Woods, chief suspect 
and murder victim's mentor. 

The witty repartee contin- 
ues between Brenner and his 
investigative partner Sara 
Sunhill (Madeline Stowe). rape 
counselor, trauma expert and 
woman from Brenner's past. 

The marketing execs 
include "romance" in their 



film description. 

It had to be resolved in 
the final credits. 

The director may be 
proud of his ensemble cast, 
but when will Hollywood learn 
that when an audience sees 
the major stars killed off one 
by one, they can pretty much 
guess that the surviving 
"name" would be the charac- 
ter who "dunnit?" 

Particular mention should 
be made of James Woods' 
intellectual performance and 
Clarence Williams Ill's strong 
but misguided characteriza- 
tion. Well done. 

Paul Brenner, Travolta's 
character, was cautioned to 
remember he was both a sol- 
dier and a policeman and to 
know he had to decide 
between the two In his inves- 
tigative resolution. 

Travolta came across as 
playing two different parts, 
not as a man torn between 
philosophies. 

The general has a line, 
"Not my finest hour." 

Surely, considering the 
message, not a finer hour for 
anyone connected with this 
film. 



Summer Music Picks: Albums offer 
a range of different influences 



by Eric Baus, 
Staff Writer 



Sam Prekop's solo debut 
is one of the most listenable 
CD's I've heard in the past 
year. 

There are no hit singles, 
just 10 solid songs full of 
interesting instrumental tex- 
tures, smooth vocals and 
cryptically layered lyrics. 

For several years, Prekop 
has been the lead singer for 
Chicago's influential jazz/rock 
band The Sea and Cake and 
his first solo album is not a 
huge departure from their 
melodic, post-hippie, jazz- 
rooted sounds. 

The main strength of 
both Prekop and The Sea and 
Cake lies in their ability to 
incorporate different influ- 
ences Into their sound with- 
out coming off as trendy or 
overly eclectic. 

Although the strongest 
force in Prekop's music is 
always an experimental jazz 
sensibility, well-integrated ele- 
ments of hip-hop drum pat- 
terns, ambient computer noise 
and 60s rock are interwoven 
throughout with great success. 

Prekop has created a rari- 
ty in popular music: an album 
that can be listened to from 
start to finish. 

1 highly recommend this 
album as well as his earlier 
work with The Sea and Cake. 

Another artist who distills 
the best from many musical 
styles is Chan Marshall of the 
band Cat Power. 

Cat Power's third full- 



length album entitled "Moon 
Pix" is another installment of 
Marshall's sulky and sultry 
sounds. 

Earlier incarnations of 
Cat Power had Sonic Youth's 
Steve Shelley on drums while 
"Moon Pix" musicians include 
members from the experimen- 
tal country /blues band, Dirty 
Three. 




jangling guitar are enough to 
keep anyone's head bobbing. 

Although "Moon Pix" is 
Cat Power's most musically 
developed collection to date, 
nothing beats their beautifully 
lo-fi 1996 album. "What 
Would the Community 
Think?" 

Cat Power ranges from 
noisy Sonic Youth-like feed- 
back soundscapes to blues 
that'll make even the toughest 
listener reach for a Kleenex. 

I urge you to check them 



Other recommended 
releases: 



Pavement, "Terror Twilight" 
(Matador) 



Regardless of who is playing The Flaming Lips, "The Soft 



background, the best 
part of Cat Power's sound will 
always be Marshall's voice. 

The song "Cross Bones 
Style" shows off Marshall's 
ability to give emotional 
weight to deceptively simple 
lyrics. 

The song's quiet, hip-hop 
inspired drum beats tied to a 



Bulletin"

Women '5 soccer team not only wins gold 
medal but wins a place in the hearts of many 



by Brian Miller, 
Sports Editor 

It's not unusual for me to 
sit at home and watch a ball 
game every night. Actually, it's 
more unusual If I don't. 
However, it is highly unusual 
to see my sister and my moth- 
er glued to the TV set, watch- 
ing one with me. 

As a matter of fact, that 
has never been the case until 
last Saturday when the USA 
women's soccer team squared 
off against China. 

It was an eye opener to 
see what strides this team has 
made in the last few months. 

Led by great role models, 
Julie Foudey and Mia Hamm, 
the USA women's soccer team 
really has a little something 
for everyone. 1 think that is 
what makes them so exciting. 

Brianna Scurry, the goal- 
keeper of the team, was not 
only able to shut out China in 



regulation, but also stopped a 
penalty kick to give her team a 
window of opportunity. 

With each of the first four 
women nailing their penalty 
kicks, the game rested on the 
shoulders of Brand! Chastain 
and she stepped up and 
scored. 

With that goal, she 
instantlj- became an American 
hero. It's ama7ing to see how 
far a team can come and how 
fast a country will stand 
behind it! 

Personally, I think that it's 
great to see younger girls like 
my sister have role models in 
sports to look up to and I 
think that is also an unfair 
advantage that males have in 
athletics when growing up. 

Being the highest-rated 
women's sporting event of all 
time, I think that it is great 
that such a positive influence 
and message are being sent 
out to their fans.
