CONTROVERSY !! 



Of late there seems 
to be a new controversy 
prevalent in the Tnldsrfc 
of the student bodyo On 
Thursday, April 16, ait

Lambda Sigma Phi was 
on probation and that; 
the dnace Friday was ibo

the area outside Dean 
Mange's office for a 
meeting with him con- 
cerning this?. The 
meeting was mobilized 



to room II4.3 b and the 
following resulted. 

The discrepancy was 
over the use of an out- 
side checking account 
by the Lambda Sigma Phi 
fraternity. The prob- 
lem arose as a result 
of a rule which is sta- 
ted in the Student Or- 
ganizational Handbook 
under Organizational 
Finances as follows: 
Responsibility for the 
hP'^dling and audit of 
Student organizational 
funds has been delegat- 
ed by the University to

fice, which serves as a

THE PURDUE INDIANA THEATRfi— AN EDITORIAL BY WILLIAM D. ROBERTS, 
^" STUDENT SENATOR 



Let me start out by 
first saying that this 
editorial is by no 
means ans attempt to de- 
grade either the -theatre 
or the fine personnel 
who contribute so well 
in putting on the pro- 
ductions which have 
given it a name through- 
out the country. It is 
merely an attempt to eiv 
lighten the student boc^ 
in yet another of the 
administrations ways of 
shifting the costs of 
operating this school 
onto the already over- 
burdened shoulders of 
the students' pocket 
books . 

This year the budget 
proposed by the theatre 
to the members of the 
student government 
showed that out of a 
projected income of 
|22,550.l5 the students 
are expected to pay 



$6,980. This amounts 
to 30^ of the operating 
capital. At the same 
time the school i going 
to put up only ^ll, 6OO 
or 20.39%. I pose this 
question to the members 
of the student body at 
large: Should the stu- 
dents habe to pay acti- 
vity fees in order to 
pay more of the costs 
of the operation of the 
theatre than the school 
administration? The 
major basis of support 
for the theatre is the 
fact that it is an aca- 
demic program and in 
truth the benefits of 
the theatre are prob- 
ably enjoyed by t^© 
Literature and History 
departments of . this 
school, some of whos« 
instructors make view- 
ing of some productions 
a requirement for their 
oourses. I ask you^

One last point of in-

-STUDENT 

PARTICIPATION- 

(cont'd, from issue 19) 

Thie rights of students to free Inquiry and ex- 
pression in the classroom and in conference is 
asserted in the Joint Statement on Rights and 
Freedoms of Students . Students also have a stake 
in the quality of their formal education, which 
must take into account their needs and desires. 
The categories which follow are those in which 
student involvement is commonly found; they are 
not intended to exclude other areas of involve- 
ment, which might be developed where there is 
sufficient student interest. It is for the par- 
ticular institution to determine the mode and ex- 
tent of student involvement and the criteria of 
eligibility for that involvement. 
A. Admissions- 

Students have a stake in the size, composition, 
and quality of the student body, and should have 
their views on admissions heard along with those 
of faculty and administration. Similarly, graduate 
students should be able to participate construc- 
tively in decisions regarding the admissions po- 
licy of their respective departments. 

B« Academic Pro grams - 

Students should be consulted in decisions re- 
garding the development of already-existing pro- 
grams and the establishment of new programs. As 
members of the academic community they should 
have the opportunity for similar involvement with 
respect to course load and degree requirements. 
For example, they may submit reports to the ad- 
ministration or the appropriate faculty or de- 
partmental committees through their own curricu- 
lum committees, or through membership in joint 
curriculum committees. When provision is made 
for an experimental student-operated curriculum, 
students should have primary responsibility for 
decision-making. l.'flien provision is made for stu- 
dent participation in curricular decision, cri- 
teria for eligibility should be devised jointly 

by faculty and students, 

C. Academic Courses and Staff 

Students should have the opportiinity, through 
established institutional mechanism, to assess 
the value of a course to them, and to make sug 
gestlons as to its direction. Students should 
also be able to express their views on the form 
and conduct of a class which they have taken, for 
example through an evaluative questionnaire pre- 
pared by joint faculty student effort, and their 
opinions should be weighed in faculty decisions 
affecting faculty status. The faculty member, of

ARC Time 
Again ! ! 



The ARC (Association 
of Regional Campuses) 
Convention will be held 
on the 17th, 18th, and 
19th of this month. 
The ARC has one conven- 
tion each semester, 
conventions are 
so that delegates 
all the regional 
campuses may get to- 
gether to discuss bus- 
iness, exchange ideas, 
and keep abreast of 
what is happening at 
all of the regional cam- 
puses. 

its organiza- 
year ago, the 
faltered many 
times due to a lack of 
adequate leadership. 
Still, it has joined in 
the fight against paid 
parking and has sought 
a method to get better 
representation for the 
regional campuses. 

The delegates repre- 
senting this campus 
will be Mike Nusbaumer, 
Frank Ackey, Bernice 
Damir:eyer, Tom Newman, 
Suzanne Cabler, Chuck 
nossman aidother Inter- 
ested nerijons. 

We asked what they 
hoped to accomplish at 
this convention, Mike 
Nusbavuner said, "We are 
going totry to get bet- 
ter representation for 
the regional campuses," 
Two tentative methodsof 
doing this are to form 
a lovvy forthe regional 
campuses at the central 
campuses, or to hire a 
lawyer to represent the 
regional campuses tothe 
administration. 



aT:uaent rarticipation... Continued ^^ra pa^e i; 

course, should be duly protected from capricious 

and uninformed judgment by students, just as he 

should be from such judgment by anyone else. 

D, Academic Evaluation 

The method by which students are evaluated is 
properly of concern to them. Accordlnly, stu- 
dents should be heard with respect to the grading 
system as an institution. They should also have 
clearly established mefeins of recourse against 
prejudiced or capricious grading. 

E. Academic Environment i 

The scheduling of courses, class size, distri- 
bution of night and day classes, calendar arrange- 
ments, library policy and development, and simi- 
lar academic arrangements and services affect the 
ability of students to do academic worB:. They 
should share in the formation of policies on 
these matters. 

Student Participation Irl Other Institutional Af- 

fairs- 

,t 

A, Extracurricular Activities- 
Students should have primary responsibility 

for activities sponsored by the student body. 
Other appropriate persons and groups should be 
able to discuss such activities and be consulted 
with respect to them, ' Among these activities 
are cultural programs sponsored by the student 
body, student political ^affairs, and student pub- 
lications; the intellectually vitality and aca- 
demic freedom of the student body will be in- 
sured in such activities by adequate representa- 
tion of student taste and opinion. 

B. Student Regulations 

Students should have primary responsibility 
for the formulation of clear and readily availa- 
ble regulations pertaining to their personal 
lives, subject only to such restrictions as m^ 
be imposed by law. 

C, Student Discipline 

Students should hav^ the opportunity to parti- 
cipate in establishing standards and procedures 
which govern student discipline, and take part 
also in the actual disoiplinary process . Disci- 
plinary proceedings should be in accordance with 
the provisions of the j Joint Statement on Right s 
and Freedoms of Students . 

D. Other Institutional]! Concerns 

Students have a right to be heard, through for- 
mal means, on question'^ involving an institution^ 
budget, its physical if'esources, and its relation- 
ship with groups or agencies external to the cam- 
pus. Provisions shoulitl exist for the transmlssiai 
of student views on suph matters to the faculty, 
j&gt;resident, and governing board.

NOTES. 



by Randy Artherhults 

April 10th, 11th, 
and 12th marked the 
tenth annua*! Circle K 
convention held in An- 
gola, Indiana. The 
purpose of the conven- 
tion, sponsored by Tri- 
State Circle K club, 
was to discuss the fu- 
ture of Circle K and 
its services, to rede- 
fine districting in the 
state for membership 
purposes, and to elect 
hew state officers. 

Several contests and 
award presentations 
established our own 
Circle K club as the 
truly productive organ- 
ization that it is. A- 
mong our conpetitional 
triumphs at the conven- 
tion were first and 
second place winnings 
in the oratorical con- 
tests, second place in 
the " Man-mile" award, 
third place in the at- 
tempt for the governor^ 
trophy, first place in 
. the Single Service 
award presentation. 

The results of the 
elections brought oar 
own Kenneth Scott Jr. 
to the Governor' s of f 1® 
of the state Circle K. 

Spirit 

CANCELS I ! I 

By now everyone has 
heard that the Spirit, 
so enthusiastic adver- 
tised for Hargorarbor 
days, has been cancebd. 
Put fear not, oh stud- 
ents of lU-PU for there 
will be a concert at 
the Port Wyane Coliseum 



on April 29. After the 
Spirit canceled Student 
Union Board began a 
mass calling list and 
"finally succeeding in 
^definitely securing the 
'Frijid Pink and the 
Box Tops. So hurry-get 
your tickets now for a 
definite show that will 
be definitely goodl 
;; On April 25th there 
•will be a dance in the 
t6tudent Lounge to kick 
off Harborarbor Days. 
•Playing will be the 
"Pure Punk" from Bloora- 
ington. The dance is 
free to activity card 
holders and $1.50 to 
the public. 

Deadlines for all 
forms for the Harborar- 
bor Days have been ext- 
ended a week more. 



here's what 

YOU SAID! 



Ijy Ellen Bama 



The queen applica- 
tions are due this week. 
This year it is set up 
so that the student body 
votes only on the five 
finalists. (The five 
are picked by a special 
p^inel). And so the ques- 
tion this week is: "How 
do you feel aboutaspeo- 
ial panal picking the 
finalists for the queen 
for Harborarbor Days? 
Kerry Umber - I feel that 
Tt would be unfair for 
the Student Board to 
pick the finalists for 
the Queen Contest .Every 
organization should have 
the right to run a can- 
didate even if she does 



not have a chance of 
winning. After all, if 
an organization displays 
an Interest in campus 
activities, that intered; 
should not te suppressed 
by the Student Union 
Board. 

Bonnie Bunch -Personally 
I dislike thewhole idea. 
If nine organizations 
want to run a queen, let 
there be nine queen can- 
didates. It's the only 
fair way. Why should a 
few people-the prelimi- 
nary judging committee- 
be allowed to decide who 
the student body should 
vote for? And how can 
that group possibly be 
unbiased? Either the 
preliminary Judging 
should be eliminated en- 
tirely, or people totally 
disassociated from the 
school should be used 
as judges. Any other 
way, it' s a farce. 

Randy Artherhults -I 

feel that the student 
votes should be allowed 
to vote for all contes- 
tants rather than just 
those chosen by the 
panel as finalists, 
thus widening the pos- 
sible choices and pre- 
ferences, (It also re- 
stores at least vaguely 
significant power to 
the students at lU-PU.) 
John C. Echols -I really 
don't care. They can't 
do any worse than any- 
body else. 

Penny Sayles Vfhat' s 

wrong with the old sys- 
tem? 

Daniel C, Symonds 1 

think that its a fine 
idea. That is unless 
they decide the candi- 
date from Circle K 
should not be a final- 
ist. Get the picture? 
Think about it. 



Li^ther Kinp: Montesori 
School. "Paying the 
fine and continuing to 
operate Is vital to a 
healthy Greek system," 
he added. 

Mr. Bolinger men 
began by explaining why 
the rules under ques- 
tion are set up. He 
feels that, "the vio- 
lation of Lambda Sigma 
Phi is a violation 
against the state of 
Indiana." He also feels 
ttoat there has been too 
much assuming going on 
by the organizational 
treasurers , He pro- 
ceeded to okay the 
dance. He expounded to 
the two main things 
that were discovered by 
this event: 1) that it 
is against the law to 
deposit money generated 
on campus into an off 
campus account; and 2) 
if an organization has 
an activity off - cam- 
pus, the money genera- 
ted can go into an off- 
campus account. 

Dean Manges closed 
by saying, "What this 
event means is that we 
take time and sit down 
and talk them out." He 
added he will be send- 
ing out notes to clar- 
ify the rules on monies 
generated on campus and, 
about campus accounts 
very soon. 

Lambda made the 
final comment that they 
will still give the 
llOO to the Martin 
Luther King Montesori 
School.

in the University to 
the University account 
as stipulated by the a- 
bove quote. Instead 
the money was deposited 
in an outside account 
because, as Lambda 
claimed, -it had debts 
3from the dance to cover 
within a shorter per- 
iod of tlmethan 7-10 
days it takes for a 
check to be processed 
through the business 
office o Prom this 
point Lambda went on to 
state what they felt to 
be the unfairness of 
requiring an organiza- 
tions to get permls-sion 
to spend its own money 
and also of the 7-10 
day delay in acquiring 
funds from its own ac- 
count. Dean Manges sy- 
mpathized with the stu- 
dents and admitted the 
need for a new system 
of handling Greek Or- 
ganizational accounts ► 

However, he did not 
approve the means which 
they used to bypass the 
problem by what he 
called a well-estab- 
lished rule," Adecls- 
lon as toi«wa official 
actual probation of 
Lambda Sigma Phi "Prat- 
ernlty and cancellation 
of the dance was left to 
be considered at 
litOO of the same day,

Dean Manges miade an 
opening statement thank- 
ing Mr, Jim Bolinfrer, 
"We've tried to be con- 
sistent and tried to be 
fair," said the Dean, 
"We saw the problem: a- 
rlsing and Mr, Bolin,g;©r 
had the guts to take 
action," he added. 

He then continued to 
thank all the others 
^present for again exer- 
cising the policy of 
"sitting down and talk- 
ing things out. I 
think we are communica- 
ting," he stated, 

Steve Pettyjohn con- 
tinued the meeting by 
making sure that only 
Lambda would be dis- 
cussed and not the 
total Greek system. He 
went on to say that 
Lambda violated the 
rules but felt that per- 
haps they had been dri- 
ven to violating them. 
He added that it would 
hurt Lambda not to have 
this dance and they did 
not want togo on social 
probation, so he sug- 
gested that "Lambda

KIRK &amp; GREGORY-- 
I DEBATE?? 

by Don Stuckey 
On the evening of 
April 9th, a capacity 
crowd in the lounge 
greeted Russel Kirk and 
Dick Gregory with a 
significant round of 
applause. Approximate- 
ly two hours later, the 
two prominent national 
figures were 

awarded an equally 
warm round of applause. 
What was In between is 
difficult to describe. 
However, I am certain 
of two things. It was 
not a debate and there 
was little discussion 
between the two gentle- 
men concerning the as- 
signed topic — Threats 
to our Democracy, 

Dr, Kirk began by 
stating that the two 
major threats to our 
democracy are central- 
ization of power in 
Washington and the 
spread of ideological 
fanaticism. Gregory 
followed with what he 
thought was the great- 
est threat; the Nazi 
controlled C.I. A. Then 
followed a rebuttal 
period which was about 
as stimulating as my 
Thursday afternoon 
statistics lecture. 
Kirk asked dull ques- 
tions, Gregory didn't 
answer. Rather, he 
rambled on and on about 
some interesting things 
that had little rele- 
vance to the topic sup- 
posedly being debated. 

My immediate thoughts 
following the so-called 
debate were that Kirk 
ought to remain a writ- 
er and Gregory should 
haveremained acomedian*

Progres sives 
Take Form 

On Sunday, April 12, 
the Democratic Progres- 
sives of Allen County 
met at the regional 
campus to hear a speech 
by Rirby thence whom 
t!-.ey are supporting as 
a candidate for the 
state lerlslature-. "a- 
sic organization and 
party leadership was 
also outlined. 

Mike Nusbaumer op- 
ened the meeting by in- 
troducing Kirby Pence 
and giving a lettle of 
his background. Mr. 
Pense opened his speech 
by predicting the big- 
gest political upheaval 
in the history of con- 
servative Insiana. But 
he pointed out the com- 
mon fault in past rev- 
olutions as being one- 
Issulsm. He believes 
that discussion should 
be focused on more than 
just Vietnam and Pollu- 
tion, There are state

sentatives and a Gov-

debate. Let us all 
thank the Almighty that 
Gregory was at least 
funny. He made a bear- 
able evening out of a 
isible.^dlsastor. 



NEXT... 
"The Idiot" 

The film adaptation 
of Part I of Dostoyev- 
sky's "The Idiot" is 
the next in the Indiana 
Purdue at Port Wayne 
Film Series to be shown 
at the campus, Friday 
April 17. The vividly 
acted drama of mid-nin- 
eteenth century St. 
Petersburg revolves a- 
round the fascination, 
loose-living Nastasia, 
the mistress of a count 
who has ofrere-' a large 
dowry to the man who 
will take her o'^f his 
hands so he may marry. 

The "New York Post" 
called the film, "...a 
richly impressive pic- 
ture. The performances 
are beyond criticism. 
One has the fixed idea 
that these people have 
been inside these roles 
for a lifetime in a 
state theater, and that 
these roles are more 
real to them than their 
own lives: In direction 
photography and settings 
there Is undeniable au- 
thority. 'The Idiot' 
has so much to offer 
that it can be recom- 
mended to anyone with 
the slightest intial 
interest in the sub- 
ject." __ 




Business Department Develops 
MEDIAN 

For Improvement ! 



The Business Depart- 
ment on this campus has 
decided to try some- 
thing new to better 
their department and 
help their stu-^ents. 

The Business Advisory 
Committee is made up 
of six students. These 
students will meet with 
faculty members in a 
meeting, and will work 
together on such things 
as curriculum and the 
general conduct of the 
Business Department, 
They are hoping that 
the students on tljj^ 
committee will be able 
to contact other stud- 
ents in the Business 
Department and then 
report in the committee 
meetings, things that 
should be done to help 
the department. 

So far this year as 
a result of the commit- 
TntT'oduntion 



^. 



the 



S' 



to Business WlOO will 
be changed in si^ch a 
way as to more current- 
ly and accurately re- 
flect the role of the 
business forms in our 
enviroment. This course 
change will start wltho 
the fall semester. 

As plainly seen, 
such a committee will 
be beneficial to all 
concerned. It will put 
the students and facul- 
ty on much better 
ground when it comes to 
understanding each 
others problems, be- 
carse they will be 
working together to try 
to solve them. 

The student members 
6f the Advisory Commit- 
tee are Dennis Blume, 
Danice Bowers, Drake 
Chandler, John Grand- 
staff, Craig Hookers, 
and Richard Thonert. 



cohto from pg»- , 
concern as tnese nat»- 

ional crises. Some re- 
forms which he suggest- 
ed are: the placement 
of state commLtieemen 
on the ballot; the, eli- 
mination of the license 
bureau as a polfiticaf* 
arm; and other reforms 
involving the Highway 
Department, the State 
Scholarship Commission, 
and a labor relations 
act. As for pollution, 
Mr. Pence suggested 
three kinds: political,, 
moral, and environment- 
al with special empha- 
sis on the City Li^^ht 



plant which he believes 
■should be either closed 
down or cleaned up* 

After Mr. Pence's 
speech. Ken Steer out- 
lined the power struc- 
ture of the Democratic 
Progressive Party; 
Scott Gillie, personnel 
described the role of 
high schools in camp- 
aignihg; and Dave 
Schmidt, treasurer, re- 
vealed money-raising i- 
deas and plans.
