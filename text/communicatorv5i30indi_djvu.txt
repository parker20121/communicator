Indiana-Purdue was not represen-

coordinate a campaign for a student 
member of the Indiana Board of 
Trustees, according to the Indiana 
Daily Student. 

In July. Governor Otis Bowen will 
select three trustees for the board. 

The Students' Government here, 
like all other regional and state-sup- 
ported colleges, received an invita- 
tion to the February 23 meeting in 
Bloomington. 

Representatives from I. U. Bloom- 
ington, I.U. Southeast, I.U. South 
Bendand Indiana State were in 
attendance. 

Bob Wensits, student body presi- 
dent and one of the coordinators of the 
student trustee meeting remarked 
about the lack of representation, 
"They all said they were coming. I 
just don't know." 

Tom Herons, vice president of 
Bloomington's student assembly and 
the other coordinator, said, "Every- 
body knows our plan. I think the 
problem is a lack of interest. We can't

By REX PUTT 

Arthur W. Friedel, faculty repre- 
for the Student Affairs 
Committee, presented a proposition 
at the Purdue Faculty Senate meeting 
on February 21, 1974, that would 
eliminate all parking fees at Indiana- 
Purdue. 

The resolution which simply 
called for the elimination of fees for 
parking stickers at Indiana-Purdue, 
was defeated by the Purdue Faculty 
Senate. 

Don Schmidt, a member of the 
Parking Advisory Committee, attend- 
ed the meeting in order to state the 
opposing views of the proposed 
resolution. 

The majority of the opposition 
voiced the opinion that the parking 
fees are needed to finance necessary 
upkeep of the present parking lots and 
the addition of new lots in the future. 

The supporters of the resolution 
indicated in their proposal that the 
Board of Trustees recently approved 
the release of approximately $160,000 
of the $380,000 presently in the 
parking fund for the purposes of 
improving drainage and resurfacing 
of some of the present facilities. Also, 
the money was to be used for 
installing additional sidewalks and 
steps in existing facilities. 

The extra $200,000, according to 
the resolution, could be used for the 
maintenance, improvements and add- 
itions to existing parking facilities. 

The parking fees were first 
implemented at IU-PU in September, 
1070, for the purpose of purchasing 
bonds for the construction of enclosed 
parking facilities. The construction of 
such parking facilities remain a 
distant possibility. 

One statement, expressing oppo- 
sition to the resolution, stated that 
there should always be some money 
in reserve, and free parking would 
certainly absorb all of the reserved 

Supporters for free parking 
argued that money accrued from the 
meters and the parking violations 
would prevent the large savings from 
becoming completely exhausted. 

Friedel joked that "high school 
teaching jobs are now more attractive 
for new teachers, since they don't 



credit hours. Not more than two 
senators from each of the two 
university factions must carry a 
minimum of three credit hours at 
IU-PU. 

Eight students will be elected at 



9 credit hours also. 

All candidates in the campus 
election must be carrying a 2.0 




l-P involved 
in health 
planning 

Indiana-Purdue is not an island; 
in fact, its faculty, students, and staff 
are extremely involved in the 
surrounding community. On example 
is the Region 3 Health Planning 
Council. Here is a short summary of 
how IU-PU people are involved in it: 

Roger Manger, dean and director 
of Purdue, and Ralph Broyles, 
chancellor of Indiana, have both 
endorsed HPC and its programs. 

Kooros Mahmoudi, a campus 
professor, has developed age-sex 
specific population projections for 
HPC. David Oh, another professor, 
has contributed many hours to HPC's 
Project Action &amp; Review Division. 
(Remember tbe two hospital propos- 
als?) Professor Thomas Guthrie has 
added much to HPC's Technical 
Planning Division, as have Doris 
Mack and Andre Wells, both instruc- 

Students Mark Zello and Tom 
Haffley have just completed a 
transportation study relative to 
hospital emergency i 



the Office of 
Student Affairs, has been of enormous 
benefit to HPC. 

Other IU-PU people have contrib- 
uted to health planning efforts in our 
area. HPC would like to improve its 
relationships even more in the future. 



have to pay for parking." He also 
showed some concern about the 
reckless expansion of parking areas. 
He is concerned about the environ- 
mental factors of the campus. 

He also added that the faculty and 
students should have some say in the 
arrangement of parking. He feels it 
shouldn't be left up to the Parking 
Advisory Committee to make all of 
the decisions. 



rangement ($30 for A and $6 for B) to 
the Board of Trustees recently, the 
faculty and students weren't consult- 



The free parking enthusiasts 
were given some consolation when 
their reserve resolution, that the new 
Student Union parking lot be changed 
from a "B" lot to a free lot, was 
passed by the Senate. It will now be 
presented to the Parking Advisory

Super-steering board 



Steering committees seem to be the order of the day around 
Indiana-Purdue. The Student Senate last week formed a student steering 
committee, the faculty have had one for some time now, and the 
administrative, clerical, and service staff have a similar body. 

These steering committees are good for the university. They insure 
that the issues will be studied from a number of varied positions. They 
provide some insurance against behind-closed-door decisions being made 
in Bloomington and Lafayette. 

The committees will serve as an educational means for the different 
constituencies on campus. Anyone ought to be able to get questions 
answered, or at least researched, simply by approaching one of these 
fleering committees. 

The committees will also provide for broader input into the 
unification process. Reports from the committees will be read by the 
people who will make the decisions. 

There is one weakness in the steering committee structure. Each 
committee will look at the issues from a very limited point of view, 
h acuity will be concerned about faculty and students will be concerned 
with students 

What is needed is a congress of all these different groups who have a 
vested interest in this campus. There needs to be a single body that can 
study the problem from all the points of view. The recommendations of 
this body will more closely take into account the welfare of all concerned 
than can those of any one of the present steering committees. 

A blue-ribbon steering committee should be formed by the local dean 
and chancellor The super-commitlee should include faculty, students, 
administrators, clerical and service staff, alumni, and community 

All of these groups are affected by the unification; therefore, all 
should be represented. 

This body should be formed immediately, so that i( can participate in 
the unification process before it is too late. 



Voter registration 



This May will see another primary election in Indiana, with the 
general election to follow in November. Many county and stale offices 
will be on the ballot. 

Both parties will present impressive candidates in attractive 
packages. Public relations firms will be retained to see that the right 
image gets across. 

Leading both tickets in the November election will be the candidates 
for U.S. Senator and Congressman. The Republicans will need to 
nominate strong candidates to unseat the Democratic incumbents. 

Both primary and general elections will be crucial to American 
politics. This will be the first test of the effects of Watergate on the 
political process. 

All who are enfranchised should register to vote in this election This 
includes nearly all of the IU-PU student body. 

The Students' Government should assist unregistered students by 
sponsoring a registration drive. No better service can be provided to the 
students than to make it easy for them to register. 

The Young Republicans and Young Democrats are willing to provide 
the deputy registrars for a campus drive. Students' Government officials 
would merely need to organize and schedule the effort. 

The last two elections saw the Students' Government pushing voter 
registration. We hope the present student administration continues this

Violence to 
spark revolution 



Editor's Note: A team of report- 
ers has spent several weeks investi- 
gating California and nationwide 
revolutionary organizations. One of 
these organizations Is the Symbionese 
Liberation Army, a group that claims 
responsibility for the kidnapping of 
Patricia Hearst. Following is the 
second of three articles discussing the 
operations of such organizations. 

By COPLEY NEWS SERVICE 

SAN FRANCISCO - The revolu- 
tionaries suspected of kidnaping 
newspaper publisher's daughter Pat- 
ricia Hearst and killing black 
educator Marcus Foster have burst 
suddenly on the national conscious- 
ness. But they are not new. 

Though they go under the name of 
the Symbionese Liberation Army 
(SLA), state and federal investigators 
believe they are an offshoot of a 
Maoist guerrilla organization named 
Venceremos - and that they have 
contacts and supporters throughout 
the United States. 

Their decision to turn to violence, 
in order to spark a revolution in the 
United States - and their decision to 
recruit a revolutionary army inside 
the prisons of the United States - 
dates back to the end of the Vietnam 

Radical leaders like Tom Hayden 
said that the time had come to turn to 
the issue of the prisons, and in July, 



Committee on Un-American Activi- 
ties as the "legal bullwark of the 
Communist Party," put together a 
position paper which read in part: 

"Whereas prisons in the mother

oppression of the people... and where-

exception It is shocking in that it 
calls for outlays of $304 billion. It is 
disturbing in that it is not only the 
highest budget ever presented but 



obtaining an overview from 
President's economic advisors. Those 
u -in;, mg were Mr. Roy Ash, Director 
ol the Office of Management and 
Budget; Mr. George Schultz, Secre- 
tary of the Treasury and Dr. Arthur 
Burns, Chairman of the Federal 
Reserve Board. I could not help but 
sense great apprehension on the part 
of these experts as they testified. 
There were some alrming assertions 
made. They stated that unemploy-

combat a slumping economy. I could 
not help but feel that these spokesmen 
for the Administration were on the 
defensive and there seemed to be no 
positive plans for solving these 



national problems from within the 
Administration. 

Beginning immediately the var-

then we can safely predict that the 
Appropriations Committee will be 
reducing those requests for appropri- 
ations over which it does have control. 
This has happened every year for the 
past thirty years. In the three years 1 
have served on the Committee these 
have been the results by fiscal year: 
The President's request for FY1972 
was cut by $6.5 billion; the Presi- 
dent's request for FY 1973 was cut by 
S3. 3 billion; the request for FY 1974 
was cut by $3 billion. All of this 
demonstrates a measure of control 
over the budget but there is so much 

One of the most important pieces 
of legislation being dealt with by the 
Congress is the Budget Reform Act. 
Dr Burns hailed this legislation as 
essential not only for a return to 
stable prices - a tool to be used against 
inflation - but for the restoration of 
confidence in government itself. He 
stated, "Since revenues are limited, 
government must choose among 
many desirable objectives and con- 
centrate its resources on those that 
matter most. That is the very purpose 
of budgets. Congress, however, can- 
not effectively determine priorities 
under its present budget procedures." 
Dr. Burns is absolutely correct. The 
Congress must modify its procedures 
to regain control over total outlays 
and determine priorities. As an 
advocate of this very necessary 
reform I am urging its passage for, if 
it does become law, it will give 
Congress the tools it will need to 
exercise effective controls over the 



as the revolutionary struggle in the 
prisons of Amerika (sic) has become 
a reality, the members of the NLG 
have a dual role to play in furtherance 
of the struggles of our brothers and 
our sisters who have become prison- 
ers of the war against oppression... 
with an eye toward destruction of the 
capitalist prison system and an all-out 
effort to integrate and raise the 
political consciousness of prisoners, 
the community at large, and, of 
course, ourselves." 

A document titled "NLG Prison 
Position Paper" put it more succinct- 
ly. It was tabled at a National 
Executive Board meeting in San 
Diego, Calif., in February, 1972: 

"Prisoners are the revolutionary 
vanguard of our struggle.. .Prisoners 
are going to lead the revolution..." 

Both of the above quotations 
come from a staff study by the House 
Committee on Internal Security, 
published in late 1973. 

One letter printed by the New 
York guild advocated the killing of 
prison guards and chopping off the 
heads of their children and pulling 
them in front of jails. A copy of the 
guild magazine in which the letter 
appeared (The Midnight Special) was 
confiscated after being sent to San 
Quentin. 

One former inmate, Lee Arthur 
Smith, has testified that he determin- 
ed to kill a correctional officer at the 
California Men's Colony and did in 
fact assault two guards - with the 
approval of the San Francisco 
chapter of the National Lawyers 
Guild. 

"The hit (killing or assault) had 
been decided on by one of my 
associates, who is a revolutionary and 
also a member of the guild," Smith 
told the House Committee on Internal 
Security. 

The purpose of the hit, and a 
resulting strike, was because the 
colony was a "very peaceful place," 
Smith said. It was felt it was time to 
generate unrest there. 

The strike and its aftermath 
resulted in violence and damage to 
prison property. The guild denied 
Smith's story. 

Perhaps coincidentally with the 
activities of the revolutionaries, 
violence in California prisons has 
soared to a new high, with numerous 
stabbing deaths and threats against 
guards. The violence led to an 
unprecedented lockdown of the pris- 
ons, with all prisoners confined to 
their cells. 

Meanwhile, a powerful revolu- 
tionary group has formed -- Vencer- 

"It is probably the most danger- 
ous group there is in existence now in 
the streets," said William Hankins, 
investigating sergeant at San Quen-

ByANNOXLEY 

HOLLY OLD ENGLAND 

Ruth Langhinrichs is back at her post in the English 
department at IU-Purdue this semester. (A true 
compliment to her leaching prowess was once voiced by a 
former Marine who said, "She runs a real boot comp") 
Rev. Richard, Ruth, and children Julia and Jennifer spent a 
sojourn in an exchange of pulpits with All Souls Unitarian 
Church in Golders Green, a north western section of 
London. They were participants and observers of the recent 
crisis Christmas. 

When the three day heat and light edict went into effect 
touched not only the businesses but the schools and 



most English families they i hose ihe living room. There 
was no form of enforcement, the effort was individual and 
unanimous. On nearby Bishops Row where many of the 
various embassy people maintain their residences, the 
Lanhinrichs noted that the diplomatic corps too was 
restricting itself to the one lit room regime. 

The British thrive on crisis, but courteous concern for 

visitors directed an endless chain of "Are you warm

growing in direct ratio to the increasing restrictions. 
Individual hot water bottles were a must with whimsy 
furnishing the youngsters of the chilly clime with rubber 
duckies, bears, or other animal shapes bottles. The ever 
present dissenter strain was represented by the dour souls 
who refused such creature comfort as 'decadent' and 
tainted as an electric blanket.

selection. Ruth and Dick had a particularly memorable 
time browsing the Wedgwood in a fine shop lit entirely by 
candles set in heirloom candelabra. The eighteenth century 
was as close as "Pinder the Ironmonger" whose window 
featured a display of parafine burning lamps with the shop 
illuminated by many samples of the same. 

London has a traditional Christmas tree in Trafalgar 
Square. Christmas 1973, it underwent strict lighting 
rationing. It blazed resplendent for five minutes on 
Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. A bright five minutes 
for Boxer Day being cancelled out. Like our famous 
Bouncing Ball on New Year's Eve in Times Square, if you 
sneezed or blinked your eyes -- you missed the whole thing. 

RIDING THE COACH 

One of the real benefits of PTC commuting, if direct 
delivery to the door of Kettler isn't delight enough for you, is 
contact with that diminishing individualist, the transit 
driver. The New York taxi driver is a legend in his own, 
(and on yours) time. But the Fort Wayne bus busters have a 
true and trusty tone all their own. 

Ed Vonderau on a recent snowy day trip had opinions to 
offer on subjects from the sad state of snow removal in the 
city to the possibilities of soy bean protein. Since riding was 
free on PTC that Dollar Day, he courteously discouraged 
his mountees from making any cash offerings. Ruefully he 
admitted having unsuccessfully proposed mounting a tin 
cup for the drivers' beer benefit fund beside the token taker. 
Shouts of passengers that, "There's a lady running for the 
bus," brought Ed to a halt in mid block. He announced to his 
audience that, "She's not late for this bus. she's just a little 
early for the next one." 

Ed is not a fluke. Driving droves of people fro and to 
daily does something to and for a man or woman. They are 
all rugged or polished individualists. 

Dickens and Thackery used to make much of stage 
coach rides from hither to thither in old England. If we have 
like local leisurely talents, they could do well to research 
"By Coach from Canterbury Green to Southtown Mall." 

EGGS ANYONE? 

Dr. Linda Fox has a people over-run in her Spanish 
literature class this semester. It doesn't phase the ebullient 
professor. She likes modern Spanish writers and manages 
to imbue her ponderous sized class with interest. 

There is always the favorite writer in any literature 
class. Dr. Fox likes Machado. Lecturing on the late poet she 
sympathetically remarked, "He despied what he had to do 
to make money - which was teaching " She continued to tell 
of the trials of a teaching poet. One day Machado walked 
into his classroom and found a group of his students 
gathered in a knot at the rear. Inquiring mildly what they 
were doing, he got the astonishing reply that they were 
hungry and "frying eggs." 

IU-PU has seen some strange sights and stunts, but 
could we equal that simple Spanish school for surprises? 
Maybe in a chem lab ??????

9 of 12 from the charity stripe. The 
unbelievable part was the fact that he 
scored 30 of Concordia's 33 second half 

For South Side it was the big three - 
Hill, Burt, and Hallgren - all scoring in 
double figures for the victory. Burt had 19 



Archers because Parker will cool off after 
Monday's game. 

North Side built up a big 20 point lead 
and settled back for a 12 point win over the 
county champions Leo. Jim Lindsey had 
the hot hand for the Redskins. 

Elmhurst, led by Don Taylor, over- 
came a 23-23 halftime tie to beat the 
scrappy New Haven Bulldogs. It was a 
close game until the last couple of minutes. 

I would have to give the edge to North 
Side because of one individual - By Hey. 
Hey seems to turn his players into 
supermen when the sectionals come each 
year - and this year is no exception. 



Intramural eager goes up for easy layup 
in recent Indiana-Purdue competition. 



There were a few changes from last 
week's standings as the Roadrunners 
moved from fifth to fourth when the NBA 
Professionals were upset The Heads and 
Stoneface moved up a place followed by the 
NBA Pro's. Both the Superstuds and 
Gemini advanced and Ottenweller's squad 
held the final spot. Circle K, with a 44-43 
loss to Gemini, dropped out of the top 10. 

SECTIONAL 

Well, it's going to be South Side vs 
Concordia and North Side against Elm- 
hurst in Sectional I tomorrow afternoon. It 
isn't even necessary to talk about the other 
Sectional because Northrup is the only good 
team involved. 

But it will be the Archers vs. the Cadets 
n what will become a high scoring affair.

Indiana is ll 


1 in conference play, 



leading Michigan (10-2) by a game and 
Purdue (9-3) by two. The Hoosiers have 
only two remaining conference games. 

The turning point of the season came a 
couple of weeks ago when Indiana posted 
an easy victory over Michigan. Michigan 
came right back and trounced the Purdue 
Boilermakers to put a dim on their title 

The reason for the sudden burst of 
strength shown by the Hoosiers is the play 
of 6*11" Kent Benson. Benson (and 
sophomore Scott May) have been coming 
on strong in the past games and with them 
go the Hoosiers.
