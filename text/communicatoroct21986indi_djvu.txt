Chancellor 
discusses 
school issues 



By MICHELE R. SHAFFER 
EdIlor-in-Chlef 

Chancellor Thomas Wallace held a 
question and answer sessirai Sept. 24 
with membere of IPFW's student body. 

Wallace and the students, oil 
members of the Student Senate and the 
Student Union Board of Governors 
(SUBOG), discussed the construction of 
the proposed fine arts facility, getting 
students to utilize the Walb Memorial 
Union Building, and to the rein- 
statement of the HPER (health, 
physical education and recreation) 

Some student government members 
had lingering concerns that the 
proposed fine arts facility would not be 
built on campus, and instead be con- 
structed downtown. Wallace said that 
building on campus remained to be 
"high priority" to all administrators; 
and the actual classroom building will 
be built on campus. Wallace explained 
that the talk is about building a per- 
forming arts theater downtown. 

"Let me distinguish things. Two 
things are toeing mentioned. One is an 
instructional facility for the studio 
classes in fine arts," he said, "The 
other pari is a performing arts theater. 
They are two separate issues. What we 
will have is an insbTictional facility on 
campus, that replaces downtown." 

The question remains. Wallace said, 
about what to do with a fine arts 
theater. " . When it comes to a per- 
forming arts theater, that may be 
where people in the community might 
(have a say) in building the facility — 
on campus or downtown." 

Wallace told the students that many 
questions and issues remain concerning 
such a downtown theater. 

The topic of reinstating the HPER 
classes was also raised, Wallace told 
the students that generally, if the 
classes were being offered as just 
personal enrichment or recreation, 
they would be too expensive. If the 
university wanted to reinstate the 
HPER classes as a degree program 
that would t&gt;e a different matter. 

Also discussed was how to draw 
shidents from the south side of campus, 
by Kettler Hall, to the north side of 
IPFW. by the Walb Memorial Union 
Building. "The problem is that this is 
not a student building." Wallace said. 

"The design of the campus ... is in- 
conducive," he continued, explaining 
that there is nothing on this side of 
campus to draw students to the Union 
building. 

Wallacesaid investigations are being 
made as to what the university can do 
to make the Union Building more 
utihzed and occupied by students. 



Education. He also was development 
officer for the Annual Giving Program, 
which he designed, for the college's 
endowment. Since 1983, he has been 
chairman of the New York City Metro 
Area Alumni-Development Directors 
Consortium, a professional association. 
Prior to this time, laquinta was 
director ot the National Alumni 
Program for Columbia University in 
New York City. He reorganized and 
doubled the activities and number of 
regional alumni chapters. He also was 
director of field services in the 



department of Alumni Relations tor 

Northwestern University. 

At Northwestern, he quadrupled the 
number of active alumni clubs 
nationwide. laquinta was granted the 
bachelor of science in journalism from 
the Medill School of Journalism at 
Northwestern University. He received 
a master of science degree in jour- 
nalism from the Puhtzer School of 
Journalism at Columbia University in 
1%7. From 1967 to 1969, laquinta con- 
ducted research in mass com- 
munications and taught in the school of 



Journalism at the University of 
Wisconsin in Madison, Wisconsin. 

laquinta has been published widely in 
the fields of academic support. He is a 
member of Sigma Delta Chi. the society 
of Professional Journalists. 

Chancellor Wallace slates. "Mr. 
laquinta has demonstrated, on a 
national scale, his capabilities in 
working all segments of university 
development. We are looking forward 
to his working with the imivereity and 
community in the design of a mature 
development program for IPFW."

Women's group honors student 

Starks' communication 
work recognized 



By SANDY PAUL 
Staff Writer 

The Indianapolis Professional 
Chapter of Wqmen in Communications 
IWIC) recently awarded Uie Florence 
Hertz Stone Memorial scholarship to 
Deborah Ann Godwin-Starks. 

Starks will use the scholarehip at 
IPFW where she is a senior majoring in 
Interpersonal and Public Com- 
munications. She also has an associates 
degree in Supervision with a minor in 
English. 

The scholarship fund honors the 
leaderstiip of Florence Herli Stone, 
president of the Indianapolis Chapter of 
WICI from 19S1-19B3 Thirty-nine 
companies and organizations con- 
tributed to the scholarehip fund. 

A resident of Churubusco, Indiana, 
Starks returned to college in 1979 on a 
part-time basis after five of her six 
children were in school. She found 
going back to school somewhat dif- 
ficult. On the way to her evening 



classes she would pick her children up 
at different schools and take them with 
her. Starks' children would wait out in 
the hallway while she attended her 

Stark said she found the staff and 
instructors at IPFW very supportive ot 
her returning to school. Starks became 
a full-time student in 1935, and plans to 
seek employment in public relations 
after graduation next May. 

Starks has been very active in the 
community, and served in many 
leadership positions. Wtiile going to 
school she has l&gt;een extremely active in 
her sorority. Gamma Phi Delta. 

She tiad an internship with the United 
Cerelwl Palsy Associatimi helping 
them prepare tor the telethon. She tias 
also had an internship with the IPFW 
News Bureau and Publications office 
and was the coordinator with Black 
Women in the Middle West project. 

Starks said she felt reassured about 
receiving an award like this. "Having 




DetKH-ah Godwin-Starks 

received a reward like this two days 
after my thirty-sixth birthday," safd 
Starks, "affirms the fact that I'm not 
getting older but better!" 



Getting credit: let the card-holder beware 



By LILLIAN LVON 

Managing Editor 

According to the American Institute 
of Certified Public Accountants 
(AICPA), 83 percent ot all college 
students hold credit cards. 

The AICPA in conjunction with the 
United Stales Office of Consumer Af- 
fairs (USOCA) has published a 
brochure entitled "Choosing a Credit 
Card? These 25 Tips May Save You 
Money" to help the public select the 
credit card which best benefits them. 

One major suggestion the AICPA and 
USOCA make is ' 
for hidden costs such 
flnance charges, and for consumere to 
shop around to find the best finance 
charge before acquiring a credit card. 
This may mean calling different hanks 
and loan institutions until you find the 
lowest rate, perhaps out-of-state. 



The current average finance ctiarge 
in Fort Wayne varies from around 16 
percent to 19.8 percent and higher. 
Lincoln National Bank has the lowest at 
16, but may be as high as 18 percent 
depending on the individual. Anthony 
Wayne offers 18 percent; Summit, 18.9; 
and Fort Wayne National, 19. B. Other 
institutions may or may not offer lower 
rates. The national average for 1985 
was IB.S and ranged from 12.5 to 21.6. 

Credit card fraud is increasing 
consistently and is predicted by AICPA 
and USOCA to reach a possible 11.13 
billion by 1990. To avoid this happening 
to you, keep a separate listing of your 
credit card numl&gt;ere and the phone 
numbers to call in the loss or theft of 
your cards- 

Many merchants also recommend 
retaining the carbon sheets between 
layers of the forms and keeping track of 
each purchase. Also, do not sign your 



credit card slip until the cashier has 
entered the amount on to the form. This 
is one way for you to be sure of how 
much you are charging and prevent 
errore in the amount (i.e. the amount is 
S25 but the cashier enteis (35). 

The brochure also warns students not 
to keep an unsolicited credit card 
received by mail. It is illegal for 
companies to issue cards to persons not 
requesting their card. It this happens to 
you, destroy the card. 

Other ideas for students included in 
the brochure are: 

— the best place to obtain a first 
credit card is through a major 
department store or gasoline company. 

— be aware that low interest cards 
generally charge interest from day of 
purchase and that many cards without 
an annual fee charge a transaction fee 
for each use. 



— remember, the longer it tak,es to 
pay oft your bill, the more interestJs 
charged. . 

~ do not give credit card numbers 
over the phone unless you Initiate tlit 
call. 

— keep receipts and compare to 
monthly bill. 

— federal law limits your liability for 
any unauthorized charges to (50 per 
card. This means if someone is using 
your card without your permission, you 
are responsible for only KO toward 
payment. Follow up phone calls 
reporting lost or stolen cards with a 
telegram or registered letter to insure 
the company is aware of the siUiatlon.

iWalb Memorial Union: 
Something must be done 

Student Union 



i( 



Walb Memorial 
Building. 

What is present in the title of the 

liuilding — "Student" — is missing in the 

actual physical presence day after day. 

week after week, January through 

December 

This is a problem tliat is perplexing 

; jnany leaders on campus. What can be 

; done to get students to migrate from the 

: cold atmosphere of Kettler Hal) to the 

• fireside lounge, the piano room, or the 
I '■ TV room in the Student Union Building? 
: The problem is a difficult one to solve. 
: The physical lay-out of the campus is a 
- large part of this problem. The Union 
[ Building was not constructed in a central 
: location — it is not close to anywhere 
: students must be By dose, we mean 
: close enough to attract students to walk 
'- over to the building, if even to take just a 

• peek inside the not-so-awful looking 
: structure 

: Part of the problem might be that 
'■ there really is nothing to draw students 
'_ from other parts of the campus. 

Take a walk through the Union 

Building. On the ground floor you have a 

. pool room that is occupied by many of 

the same students day after day How 

many of you even know IPFW has a pool 

■ '■ room with tables, video games and the 

.'.like? 

: &gt;. Down the hall you have meeting 
'■•';' fooms, the cafeteria, vending machines, 
; ■''-3nd a small lounge under the stairwell 
.with uncomfortable, plastic chairs. A 
. " large TV viewing room is also located 
'■ downstairs This room seems to be a 
; waste of space. II is obviously out-of-the- 
: way for most students. No one is hardly 
! ever there to even watch the TV. 
'■ On the firs! floor, there are several 
I offices — student services, continuing 
: education and career services to name a 
; few. The Sweet Shoppe is located on the 
first floor, along with the 
aforementioned fireside lounge and 



piano room. The huge ballroom also 
takes up quile an amount of space. 
Another interesting room is located on 
this floor — the music room. Rarely is 
music heard; it is more frequently used 
as just another meeting room. 

On the second floor, there are things 
that might interest students, if an IPFW 
student would ever consider joining a 
club or gelling involved in students' 
government. Housed on the second floor 
are the offices of the Students' 
Government leaders, the Panhellenic 
Suites occupied by the campus 
fraternities and sororities, the offices of 
Campus Ministry, The Communicator 
and more continuing education offices 
are also found on the second floor 

The problem is evident. Unless a 
student really has a reason to go to the 
Union, they will not. Unless they already 
belong to one of the organizations named 
above, they probably will not step foot on 
the second floor. It's a shame because it 
is where the heart of student activity on 
the campus lies — where the students 
who really care about the future of 
IPFW spend a majority of their out-of- 
class time. 

The answer, which has already been 
suggested, might be to move things from 
Kettler Hail to the UNION Like the old 
saymg goes, if Mohammed won't come 
to the mounlain, the mountain has to 
come to Mohammed. Translated that 
means something has to be in Walb to 
make students use the building. Whether 
it be the bookstore, or having students 
register in the Union, there has to be 
something to attract the wide diversity 
of students vou see downstairs crowding 
the halls in KelUer Hall. 

Editors Note: If any students or 
faculty have suggestions on how to 
improve the usage of the Union Building, 
send them (o the editor of this 
newspaper

Nudity shocking 



The disease of IPFW: 
Students who don't care 



It appears that IPFW has been hit with 
another epidemic of disease. No, it's not 
the flu or measles The disease is called 
"I-don't-care." Its symptoms are poor 
attendance at IPFW functions, lack of 
mterest in school related activities such 
as student government, theatre, and 
clubs. This disease is also detectable in 
the words we hear so much today. 
"there's nothing to do." 

It's unfortunate thai the student body 
has regressed to a third grade level 
where someone has to tell them what to 
do every minute of the day. It's a very 
sad slate of affairs when a college 
student cannot pick up the phone and 
dial Ihe department which they are 
interested in and find out whafs 
available!! 

If you're an accounting major, join the 
accountmg club! If you're a fine arts 
major, get involved in Purdue-Indiana 
Theatre or join the Art club. If you're a 
political science major join student 
government. There are things to do all 
over campus, 



To the Editor:

horror that 1 read the most

people who were willing to take the lime

disease has spread further than anyone 
realized. 

Student government, the students 
voice in how things are run, is also 
having problems recruiting people who 
care how things are at IPFW. When they 
do find someone who cares about IPFW 
they are usually loo busy complaining to 
actually do anything about it. 

A final comment about the altitude on 
campus. It doesn't get better by leaving 
it alone. "I-don't-care" is not a disease 
that a person can take pills for or ignore. 
It's too contagious. The only cure is to 
get involved!!!

to control these terrible

Boycott Gillette 



To the Editor: 

On Sept- 25, 1986, CNN 
Headline News showed 
employees of the Gillette 
- Cu r pura tion -system irtiCfllly" 
torturing lab rabbits in the 
testing of their products. 
These animals were subject 



to forced- feedings of GiLlette 
products as well as having 
products administered into 
the eyes The consequences 
of such actions were then 
studied by Gillette per- 
sonnel. Some animals 
committed suicide by 
breaking their own necks 
rather than t)eirig dragged 
out of their cages to endure 
such cruelty. 

Therefore I am asking that 
all IPFW students and their 
families boycott Gillette 
prodaeis^until thes^hoFribie - 

stopped. I realize that 
consumer goods need to be

not need to be treated in such 
an inhumane fashion, I have 
posted petidons for those of 
you who feel that such ac-

Gillette Corporation are 
intolerable.

NBA asks for guaranteed jobs for students 



1 

ci. 2, ]9ge m 



SAN FRANCISCO. Calif. 
— In a major address lo the 
Commonwealth Club, the 
nation's largest business 
organliaUoo, NEA President 
Mary Hatwood Futrell asked 
the nation's private sector to 
Join educators in a compact 
aimed at rebuilding the 
American economy by 
strengthening American 
public education. 

"I'll make a deal with 
you," Futrell said, "ril 
guarantee, on the behalf at 
NEA's l.B million members, 



the beat possible education 
for «vay student in every 
school in this country, la 
return. I'm asking you to 
guarantee a job for every 
graduating senior." 

Such a guarantee, said 
Futrell, would go a Img way 
toward renewing "the vigor 
and vitality America must 
have in its school system if 
our nation is [o successfully 
compete with the other 
nations of the world." 

"Hundreds oF thousands of 
students drop out," Futrell 



explained, "because they 
don't see a link between 
education and job op- 
portunity. It's our respon- 
sibility to let them know that 
we care about them, that we 
— businesses and schools 
together — care about tbelr 
futures." 

Educating all American 
children, Futrell pointed out, 
is an economic necessity for 
America. Employers today 
are facing a shrinking pool of 
potential employees. The 
number of 14-24 year olds — 



the basic entry-level worii 
foree — used to total 23 
pereent of the peculation. 
But by 1995 this greup wiU 
total only 16 percent. 

With fewer young people 
available (or work, Futrell 
said, It's more important 
than ever before that as 
many students as possible 
complete high school and be 
prepared to function ef- 
fectively in the world of 
work. 

Yet the nation's dropout 
rate is now 30 percent, with 



(he dn^out problem par- 
ticularly acute among 
minorities, many of whom 
are economically disad- 
vantaged. Many students 
lose interest in school, 
Futrell noted, when they see 
that their peers who have 
graduated are still unem- 
ployed. 

Across the nation, 57 
percent ol all poor Black 
recent high school graduates 
are jobless, said Futrell. 
Among poor Hispanic 
graduates, 4i.s percent are 



unemployed, and the 
unemployment rate among 
poor white graduates is 34 
percent. 

"Throughout our history, 
public education has given 
promise to the American 
economy," said Futrell, the 
top leader of the l.B million- 
member NEA. "Now it's 
American business that can 
help give promise to our 
children's futures."

Latest PIT production confronts homosexuality 

'The Normal Heart' a bargain

THE iMEW 
O tatewood I 



By ROY QUI NN 

Starr Writer 
On Friday Purdue- Indiana 
Theatre opened its 22 season 
with "The Normal Heart," 
by Larry Kramer. The 
audience tended to laugh at 
the accurately overblown 
camp business in the first 
act, and stayed to cheer at 
Ihe end of the second. There 
is no greater bargain in town 
(or five dollars.

Thursday Evening 

oflei good wfiludent ID 



All bargains have some 
slicking point. The evening 
ran from 8 till 11 with only a 
short interval. None of the 



cast burs! into song, which 
might have helped the time 
to pass. One or the cast, 
addressing the audience, 
asked if he was speaking 
loud enough. 

The answer had lo be, 
"Yes, you are!" Quite loud 
enough for the theatre, if not 
[or society The subject 
matter is AIDS and its effect 
on the gay community in 
New York, We may all have 
to start yelling if the 
message of this play is lo be 
efrective. 

The original Broadway 
production tended even more 
towards propaganda. In Ihe 
introduction to the printed 
edition, Mr. Kramer writes 



that the number ot reported 
cases of AIDS were painted 
on the scenery and regularly 
updated. Therewas always a 
horrifying increase. This 
idea may have been vetoed 
for this production because 
of the terrifying increase in 
cases — lOOO when tbe play 
was first produced, more 
than 20,000 now, just two 
years later. 

Amongst the players, Jim 
Hodgin shone as a human 



presence. with real 

character development, 
against a background of 
gliltering character facades. 
He speaks when others 
shout, he listens with an open 
heart, he learns lo love. 
Diane D. Shrubsall has a 
less-rounded rote; she lends 
to lean on one note through 
the evening. This may be 
deliberate, but it leaves her 
preparation of the character 
unfulfilled. The gay 
characters ranged from a 



closeted ex-marine to an un- 
inhibited Gary Lanier, 
whose unsatisfied lust for the 
maincharacler delighted the 
audience for a variety of 
reasons. Jeff Moore and 
Brian H. Wagner were the 
love interest of the evening, 
and overcame very great 
obstacles to tell a love story. 
The unfamilanty of men 
embracing, the near im- 
possibility of a true ex- 
pression of love, the 
inhibition of touch were 



transcended in a dual pei^ 
formance of tension and 
lender revelation. 

The tricks of direction 
were interesting if 
distracting. Kabuki' theatre 
may never come lo Fort 
Wayne, so anyone who has 
an interest in classical 
Japanese theatre effects 
should not miss this 
production. The strong black 
vertical panels or the set 
reinforced the spare 
direction.

Stan Writer 

"Do you know that I heard 
you can get il from 
mosquilos?" This, and other 
misconceptions like it, has 
helped gel Acquired Immune 
Deficiency Syndrome the 
reputation that il has. Un- 
fortunately this colors our 
view of this disease before 
we even know the tacts, thus 
making our judgment of 
AIDS victims one of con- 
jecture and iimuendo. 

There has been no 
scientific studies that prove 
AIDS can be caught by a 
casual touch. In fact there 
has t&gt;een numerous studies 
done proving the opposite: 
Acquired Immune 
Deficiency Syndrome can 
only be transmitted through 
intimate sexual contact or 
intravenously, Yet the 
residents of Kokomo would 
not let their children attend 
school with Ryan White, 

Which ones of us would do 
the same? 

People are very frightened 
of A1E)S and with good cause. 
There is no known cure, no 
treatment, and no recovery 
Not a pleasing thought to 
someone looking forward to 



a long, healthy tire. This is 
what makes it so difficult to 
relate to people who have 
AIDS. 

If someone had terminal 
cancer they could 

reasonably expect com- 
passion, understanding, 
someone (o stand by and 
reassure when their spirits 
are lagging. A victim of 
AIDS doesn't get any of thb. 
They are expected lo live 
and die alone, without 
support or encouragement. 

These people did not 
choose to get AIDS, When 
they caught this disease they 
did not stop being human. 
Why do we persist in treating 
ihem like they did cease to 
be the same species as you 
and I? Are we that quick to 
disown those that are less 
fortunate than ourselves? 

I hope that this is not the 
case, as that would put a low 
price on our humanity. In- 
stead, maybe it is just 
ignorance that makes us act 
as we do. It is natural to fear 
what is relatively unknown 
tHit it is not natural to con- 
demn a person for something 
out of his control. Especially 
when be needs our help so 
desperately.

'Camelot' with Harris 
to appear at Embassy 



Richard Harris reigns as King Arthur In the national 

louring company of Lemer and Loewe's musical 

"Camelot," playing at The Eroliassy Theatre Oct. 7-9 
(photo courtesy of Aiken l^lanagement). 



Lerner and Loewe's 
magical play, "Camelot," is 
coming to the Embassy 
Theatre October 7-8-9 at 8 
p.m. 

This spellbinding musical 
centers around Arthur, the 
misunderstood King of 
England. It is difficult to tell 
where fantasy leaves off and 
reality begins. Although it is 
fairly certain that King 
Arthur did exist but whether 
he really had a magician 
named Merlyn or a Round 
Table remains unknown. 

King Arthur envisioned a 
society where everyone was 
equal and loyalty and 
friendship abounds. He 
names this society, 
"Camelot." 

Unfortunately this Uttqiia 
did not lasL Arthur did not 
take into consideration 
human frailties, including 
his own, Camelot crumbled 
to the ground following the 
decay of the values that 
made it great. 

Richard Harris portrays a 
lovable and likeable King 
Arthur. "Richard Harris is 
not a pretender to the throne 
— he is King Arthur," states 
Tim Brown of NBC-TV, 
Harris won the Golden Glotie 
Award in 1%7 for the film 
vereion of "Camelot." 

This fantasy delight was 
written by T. H. While in 
1958. Originally titled "The 
Once and Future King,"' the 
title was changed in 1960 



before opening on Broad- 
way, Decemtier 3, 1960. 

"Camelot," includes such 
songs as "I Wonder What 
The King Is Doing Tonight." 
"I Loved Tfou Once In 
Silence," "How to Handle a 
Woman," and "The Lusty 
Frionth of May." 



producing hit plays shortly 
thereafter. 

Tickets may be obtained 
by calling the Embassy 
Theatre Box Office, 424-5665. 
There is a 50 cents charge for 
ticket service. 

Richard Harris began his 
career on the London stage 



What: Camelot 

When: Oct. 7 - 9 

Where: The Embassy Theatre 

Time: 8 p.m. 

Tickets: $19 and $25, reserved 



Tim Gearhart of the 
"Blade" describes Camelot 
as "dazzling. heart- 
wrenching; it's a rare and 
happy occasion when a show 
can accompUsh everything it 
sets out to do." 

Lerner and Loewe have 
produced many shows 
together over the past 23 
years. These include, "The 
Life of the Party. " "What's 
up?," and the "Day Before 
Spring" Lemer writes the 
lyrics and Loewe writes the 
musical scores. This system 
seems to work well since the 
team also produced "My 
Fair Lady," Strangely 
enough Lemer and Loewe 
did not meet through tt&gt;eir 
mutual interest in music. 
They met by chance at the 
Lambs Club and began 



in Joan Littlewood's 
production of "The Quare 
Fellow," He has performed 
with the Theatre Royal, 
Stratford East, Theatre 
Workshop. He played In 
"Macbeth" in The Moscow 
Art theatre of Stanislavaki, 
He has won six gold records 
and five Grammy 
nominations. One of the 
Gram my s came from his 
recording of "Jonathon 
Livingston Seagull." with 
music written by his friend, 
Terry James. Born in 
Limerick, Ireland. Harris 
attended the London 
Academy of Music and 
Dramatic Art. 

' He makes his home on an 
island called the Paradise in 
the Bahamas.

"Any lime you are 10-3, 
things are going very well." 
comments head women's 
volleyball coach, Arnie Ball, 
The team is indeed rolling, 
defeating Lewis Friday, with 
scores of 17-S, 13-15, 18-16 and 
15-9. 

"(Lewis) was a tough 
match." Ball slates. "They 
(Lewis) handled pressures 
very well." He adds thai the 
third game of the match, in 
which Ihe Mastodons won 18- 
16, was crucial en route to 
their victory, "There were a 
lot of long rallies," Ball says. 
"Lewis could have won, bul 
we didn't let them." 

This win boosted the 
women's conference record 
to 2-0, In the Lewis contest. 
Ball chooses center Judy 
Yagodinski as playing a key 
role in the Mastodons' 
triumph. 

There liave been several 
major players that have 
helped lead IPFW to their 
viclorious season. Ball in- 
terjects, "We have a well- 
balanced team; it's difficult 
to single out one person," 
and hsts Julie Hefty. Joanie 
Smith, Carla Gerardot, and 
Lisa Zehr, who has been the 
"most consistent," as 
prominent players in the 
season.

Gerardol both have suffered

cording to Ball. He adds that 
Julie Hefty has been out 
because of strep throat "We

Ball is optimistic about the 
season thus far. "It has been 



a pleasant experience, but it 
has been difficult." Ball 
remarks, "We have been

work. (The defense) will be a 
major emphasis in the next 
two weeks." 

Ball predicts a positive, 
but difficult, future for the 
Mastodons, "We expect to do 
well every time we play," 
Ball maintains. "The next 
couple of weeks will be 
important, to qualify for the 
conference (tournament)." 
Northern Kentucky is the 
next foe on the Mastodons' 
schedule, the game oc- 
curring this Saturday. 
Although Northern Kentucky 
is a GLVC conference team. 
Ball explains thai the match 
will not count in the con- 
ference standings, as Nor- 
thern Kentucky is not in 
IPPWs geographical 
division. Lodcing ahead to 
next week, concerning the 
Saint Joseph's match up. 
Ball comments, "They are a 
young learn, but they work 
hard; it could be an exciting 
match," Saint Joseph will 
take on the Mastodons next 
Thureday, October 9 at the 
Multipurpose Building. The 
next night IPFW will host 
Lewis, which, according to 
Ball, should be a "tough 
match."

Fifth-rated Oakland University catches 
IPFW's soccer team on the wrong day 



By DARREN J. 
WAGGONER 
Sports Editor 

Oakland University visited 
tPFW on Saturday, Sep- 
tember 27 and went home 
with a 7-1 victory. 

"We made some key 
mistakes early and fell 
behind, after that everything 
went wrong. Sort of a 
steamroll effect," said coach 
Jim Sharpe, "It was bad but 
we'll get over iL Oakland is 
ranked fifth in the nation at 
Division 11, so I'm not too 
worried." 

The top players on the 



team are Bronn Pfeiffer, 
Juan Diaz and Ricky de la 
Torre. Pfeiffer and Diaz 
have been named to the all- 
conference team the past 
three years and de la Torre 
has twice been all- 
conlerence but didn't make 
it last season. "Ricky had an 
off year but he's back this 
year," commented Shatpe. 
Salvadore de la Torre. 
brother of Ricky, tore some 
ligaments in his knee and is 
expected to be out for three 
weeks. "It sure hurts to lose 
a starter but that's part of 
the game," said Sharpe. 



On September 23rd the 
team hosted Saint Joseph's 
and went away with a 2-1 
victory. "Saint Joseph's isn't 
very good. At the half, no one 
had scored bul we settled 
down in the second half. 
They got a goal late in the 
6;ame. It really wasn't as 

I — In Brief- 



close as the score," said 
Sharpe, 

On Saturday, October 4th, 
Bellarmine College will 
come to IPFW for a 2 p.m. 
match and on October 7lh, 
Grace College will visit at 
3;30p.m.
