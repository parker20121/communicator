Farmland Controversy 

lU Foundation sells land to build assets 



Jennifer Schoenberger 
Copy Ed I lor 
Allyn Sloller 
SlafT Wrilfr 

In ]&lt;yi2 and 1975. farmland in casl- 
em Miss, loialing over 5.800 acrw in 
No;(ut&gt;cc Cotiniy was given as n gifl to 
Indiana University Trom Mariin and 
Opal Conrad.' 

Now, olmosl Iwo decades later, ihc 
land ifiai is valued at over S2 million in 
causing a conuovcrsy in both Noxubee 
County, Miss, and Bloomington. Ind. 
At the heart of the controversy are the 
Indiana University Foundation and the 
Student Environmental Action Coali- 
tion in Bloomington. 

After almost three years of negotia- 
tion and extensions involving Hughes 
Environmental Systems-Federated 
Technologies Mississippi Inc. (HES- 
FTMl). Ihe lU Foundation was no 
■ doserto selling the land because HES- 
FTMl had still not been granted the 
necessary permit to build the waste fa- 
Then the lU Foundation contacted 
Thomas Merrill, a large produce grow- 
er and cattle grazer in Calif,, who pre- 
viously had shown interest in purchas- 
ing the land. The negotiations between 
the Foundation and Merrill were con- 
ducted through an Indianapolis real es- 
tate broker. 

Merrill viewed the property and 
reached an agreement with the IV 
Foundation to purchase the land for 
S2.I million. 

The land was sold to Thomas Merrill 
Wednesday May 22 1993, but the 
controversy still continues. 

After the contract between HES-FT- 
Ml and the lU Foundation expired, 
HES-FTMI conlBctcd Menill to c)l- 
plorc the possibility of purchasing an 
option on the property. 

TTic interest that HES-FTMI has in 
building a hazardous waste incinera- 
tion plant in Miss, is due to the geolog- 
ical conditions found in that area. The 
company negotiated an agrccrncnt to 
pun;hasc 500 acres of the Miss, prop- 
erty because the land is composed of. 



according to the lU Foundation report. 
'"Selma shale' or a deep layer of lime- 
stone underground, making a part of 
the piopcrry extremely desirable from 
a safely standpoint for waste dLiiposal.'" 

Sarah Hodgdon, director of the Indi- 
ana University Student Environmental 
Action Coalition, says of the plans for 
the land, "incineration [of hazardous 
waste materials) is particularly bad for 
dairy farming." 

The Foundation realizes that there 
are very strong arguments on both 
sides of the issue. The Foundation's 
position is "the decision needs to be 
made in Miss, and that the decision is 
being made by a process and the 
process gives all those who have an in- 
terest in the issue or 
expertise in the issue a 

On the other hand, 
the Student Environ- 
mental Action Coali- 
tion feels that the deci- 
sion for the land to be, 
used as a hazardous 
waste facility is an is- 
sue of 'environmental 
racism.' The student 
group's position is that 
the Foundation's ac- 
tions were unethical 
and immoral. 

The debate began when Martin and 
Opal Conrad gave Indiana University 
farmland in both Miss, and Ind, that 
could be sold following the Marlins' 
deaths. After the death of Martin Con- 
rad, the lU Foundation received Opal 
Cor\rad's approval to turn the land into 
cash assets to be used by the university 
before her death. 

An Indianapolis real estate broker, 
Moc Thomas, was hired by the lU 
Foundation to assist in the sale of the 
land. The Foundation reports that there 
were few parties inicresied in the land, 
ond according to Foundation board 
member John F. Kimberling, there was 
not a buyer "with the financial means 
to purchase the property." 

Then. Federated Technologies Inc. 




(FTI), a Tenn. based company, had the 
interest and finances to buy the Miss, 
land. During the negotiations for the 
property, Edward Netherland of FTI 
said that the plans for the land were to 
build a hazardous waste incineration 

The United Slates Environmental 
Protection Agency's definition of haz- 
ardous waste includes both harmless 
and harmful industrial and manufac- 
turing wastes. The lU Foundation says. 
"The proposed plant would not bum 
nuclear waste or polychlorinated- 
biphenyl (PCB's)." but they gave no 
evidence to ihe authenticity of this 
statemenL 
Hodgdon says, "After FTI has spent 
this much money and 
this much time, ..[it is 
naive to say the plant 
will not accommodate] 
substances that arc 
harmful. There are no 






i that 



will i 



rate 



Hodgdon claims 
that prior to their inter- 
est in the Miss, prop- 
erty, FTI had attempt- 
ed to build a facility in 
East Pitlsburgh. Tenn, 
and the governor told the company to 
leave the state. 

In addition, Hodgdon says that FT] 
has never built an incinerator before. 

The Federal Government requires all 
stales to have a 20 year capacity assur- 
ance plan to handle hazardous waste. 
Barbara Coffman. liaison to the lU 
Foundation, states that if a private 
company does not locate a hazardous 
waste facility in the state of Miss., the 
stale of Miss, itself will operate one. 

Coffman says there arc "an estimated 
300 sites in the state that need clean- 
up, that have some sort of hazardous 
waste," 

On September 28, 1990, the lU 
Foundation, in agreemeni with Mrs. 
Conrad, proceeded with negotiations 



and gave FTI and new partner Hughes 
Environmental Systems (HES-FTMI) 
the option to buy the property for the 
sum of S3.5 million. 

The option to HES-FTMI was fol- 
lowed by student protests in both Nox- 
ubee County and Bloomington. The 
Noxubee County Committee formed to 
protest the lU Foundation's sale of the 
property and the intended use of the 
property for incineration of hazardous 
materials. 

In addition, the committee protested 
to locating the plant in an area with a 
large, over 70%. black population. 

The Foundation reports that in re- 
sponse to ihe student protests they 
"made further inquiries to ascertain 
whether the proposal of HES-FTMI 
was in fact, as it had been labeled 
by the students, 'environmental 
racism'." 

Environmental racism is a phrase 
adopted to describe the practice of sit- 
ing a hazardous waste treatment facili- 
ty in poor, predominately minority ar- 

lU Foundation board member Kim- 
berling disagrees with the snidcni pro- 
testers and feels that the incmeration 
facility would create jobs in the area. 
However the area has a very high illit- 
eracy rate along with a high, high 
school drop-out rate making skilled 
jobs unattainable. There arc approxi- 
mately 12.600 people in Noxubee 
County. 

Barbara Coffman. however, stales, 
"HES-FTMI estimates that the haz- 
ardous waste facility would provide 
more than 400 jobs and out of that 400 
they estimate that 807o of the jobs 
could be filled locally." 

Further. CofTman said that HES-FT- 
MI has committed to paying higher 
than minimum wage (the average 
wage would be $7.00 an hour) in their 
25,000 page permit application. 

Coffman believes that people would 
be needed at the plant to fill jobs on 
the grounds crew and in the cafeteria, 
jobs thai would not require a high 
school education 




Author emphasizes building child's self-esteem 



by Ngozl R. Rogers 
Chief Repoiler 

Alvin Pouissant. You may not recog- 
nize the name, but his expertise in the 
area of child development has national 
recognition. 

Pouisainl. associate professor of Psy- 
chiatry and associate dean for Student 
Affairs at Harvard University Medical 
School; author of "Why Blacks Kill 
Blacks and Black Child Care, " spoke 
at the FAST, Future Academic Scholars 
TVack graduation and recognition ban- 
quet on May 21,1993. 

"The retention rate for black college 
students is 25 percent," he says, "the 
Latin American rate is a little more and 
the Native American rate is worse," 

To combat these staiisiics Poussaint 
believes, "[You've] got to get to the 
children from binh to 3 years old, be- 
fore heads tan and before preschool." 

Studies suggest that the period from 
birth to age 3 is critical because after 
age 3, it is much more difficult to help 
the child move along. 

Poussaint said, "The situation is hard- 
er now. Because of more families un- 
der duress, more families don't know 
how to direct their children. We don't 
have enough parcnts who know how to 
educate." 

Forexamplc. some parents don't read 
to children around the age of nine 
monihs Their reason? Their kid can't 



read, so why read to them. 

"Children who are read to the most 
will talk better when they talk," Pous- 
saint explained. "Speaking to children 
has much to do with their learning and 
language," 

It has bc£n suggested that if cer- 
tain kinds of stimulus docs not take 
place, then certain pathways in the 
brain don't mature 
properly. 

Poussaint stres- 
sed. "We have to 
get to the parents 
the basics about 
children... I because] 
most of us do par- 
enting 'by the scat 
of our pants'." 

Poussaint empha- 
sized the impor- 
tance of parenting 
classes for both 
boys and girls in the 
school system, "The 
only place where 
people are held cap- 
tive. It would send a 
message to children 
that they are a critical part of us as hu- 
man beings," 

The parenting classes could also 
combat the effects of child abuse in 
America. 

Many mysterious cases of broken 
bones in children prompted a radiolo- 




gist to write a paper entitled "The Bat- 
tered Child Syndrome." Poussaint 
said. "Until 1963. there were no cases 
of child abuse." 

"In 1974 there were 75,000 cases of 
child abuse," explained Pouss.iinL "In 
1980 there were one million cases, and 
in 1989, 2,7 million cases. [The num- 
bers] are not all due to better report- 
ing. It is a real in- 
crease that shows 
the trouble that fam- 
ilies are in; [there's] 
more unemploy- 
ment, more dual 
career families." 
Child abuse and ne- 
gleet does not in- 
clude verbal abuse. 
"Verbal abuse con- 
stantly knocks the 
child's self esteem. 
Add this [to the sta- 
tistics of physical 
abuse] and it is seri- 
ous," he stated. 
"The more people 
who know about 
parenting, the less 
physical they'll be. Parents get physi- 
cal because they don't know what else 
to do." 

Instead of getting physical, Poussaint 
suggests an educational alternative like 
explaining to the child what the pretty 
package of gum is that they found in 



the check out lane instead of punishing 
the child for picking it up. 

Parenting in this manner helps to 
build a child's self-esteem, he ex- 
plained. 

"One problem with young people 
whose parents are in the lower class is 
their low self-esteem," Poussaint com- 
mented. "Some of it has to do with be- 
ing poor or black or latino, but when a 
child is raised with Mother Goose 
they're taught that the kings, queens, 
princes and princesses are white. They 
(the children] arc not there. They are 
going to think that they arc not the 
ones in charge." 

Poussaint believes that students who 
achieve feel as though they are in 
charge. They have a sense of control 
over their environment. 

"By being in charge, the child has as- 
sertive behavior that reflects belief in 
self," he explained, 

Poussaint has a special interest in 
talking about the barriers facing people 
of color because they arc loo passive 
and self -doubting, 

"We can do something about it to 
help us excel," Poussaint responded. 
"It lakes a lot of people to be involved. 
Doing these programs is labor inten- 
sive and we have to mobilize as many 
people as possible. If each [program] 
helps one child then [I'm] doing some- 
thing important." 



EEAD ME: 



Did you know that there have been an 
undetermined number of rapes and assaults on 
diis campus since the beginning of the sch.ool year? 



END THE SILENCE 



Start asking questions! 

• Why is the university's image more important 
than the safety of its students? 

• Which should come first: the students' safety, 
or the university's image? 



There needs to be an awareness of the facts and 
the incidents should be made known in order to 
protect others!

Thefts increase during summer sessions

Thefts occur everywhere — please 
secure your valuables." This is the 
message of several signs posted in 
Helmke Library. But the signs are 
not a warning for library users orUy; 
everyone on campus should take note 
that simply locldng-up valuables may 
not be enough. 

This past month, there have been 
numerous break-ins in both cars and 
athletic center lockers. 

Three lockers in the men's locker 
room were reportedly broken into 
around 5 p.m. on May 5. The locks 
on the lockers were pried off and per- 
sonal property totalling over S250 



were stolen. 

Campus Police Chief Lorcn Den- 
Hanog says because all of the thefts 
"hit on one day, [there is] not a lot to 
goon." 

The police are investigating the 
thefts. 

IPFW graduate Julio Marquez, one 
of the victims, feels that nothing is 
being done. Marquez alleges that af- 
ter filing a report of the ihefi of his 
wallet from a locker in the athleuc 
center with the campus police, a 
week passed, but Marquez did not 
hear anything about his stolen 
propeny. 

Marquez is amazed. "It is unbeliev- 
able thai nobody hears anyihiog. At 
least ihrec were ripped off. Nothing 



happened. We never heard from ihe 
police." 

Eventually another victim of the 
thefis received a phone call from the 
Goodwill in South Bend. TTie person- 
al items belonging to the viciims had 
been recovered, and the Goodwill 
employees telephoned the owners. 

Chief DenHanog says, '^e need to 
appeal to the people in the athletic 
center to watch and be aware. The 
eyes and cars of people are what we 
need." 

In addition to the locker break-ins, 
ihere have been cai break-ins. On 
May 22, three cars were broken into 
during a soccer game on campus. 
Purses were stolen out of the cars 
parked in Lot I. 



Campus police claim they are work- 
ing on a plan of action so that they 
may respond appropriately to the 
thefts. Furthermore, the police indi- 
cate thai they have a few leads. 

Chief DenHartog says, "We are 
working on this one. Thai is as much 
as I should say now. 

"Most [of the thefts) were off cam- 
pus people. But, for students, staff, 
and faculty; don't leave valuables in 
vehicles. Make sure they are in the 
trunk or out of view. It only takes 30 
seconds to hit and nm." 

Chief DenHanog says "If anybody 
sees anything, please call the campus 
police. The campus is for all of us 
and we all need to keep ii safe." 



By KrisUeSchlundl 
Editor-in-Chief 

A sign, ihe content of which ap- 
pears above, was posted throughout 
the IPFW campus a few weeks ago. 
Lorcn DenHanog, chief of university 
police, welcomed the opportunity to 
respond. 

DenHartog recounts, "Linda John- 
son, coordinator of the Center for 
Women and Returning Adults, called 
me and asked, 'do you know some- 
thing i don't know'7" 

According to DenHartog, university 
police records indicate that the last re- 
poned rapes occurred in 1990, 

As to any university 'cover-up,' 
DenHanog points out that the univer- 
sity police publish both quanerly and 
annual statistics reports that are 
mailed lo all university faculty and 
staff. In addition, the reports are 
available to everyone ai the IPFW 
mformaiion ofTice. 

DenHanog admits, however, that it 
is possible that crimes, including rape 
and assault, may be committed on this 
campus but never reponed. 

"I'm not so blind or ignorant ihat I 
don't realize that not everything is re- 
poned," DenHanog says in reference 
(o the allegations that appeared on the 
signs. 

"We want to know." DenHartog 
continues, "because we want to help. 
We don't know what steps to take to 
address any new problems (if rapes 
and assaults are not reported to uni- 
versity policcl. !f we knew about it. 



we could lake better stqjs." 

Jeanetie Clausen, director of 
IPFW's Women's Studies, agrees that 
incidents of rape and assault are often 
not reported. 

"Regardless of who put [the sign] 
up and what ihcir purpose was, I 
think there is probably something 
ihcre. In any group of women you'll 
find those who have been coerced in- 
to having sex, and I've been lold (by 
students) of siiuations where ... the 
man has received the equivalent [pun- 
ishment] of 'don't do it again'." 

Clausen is quick to discount the 
suggestion that the university would 
conceal problems regarding the safety 
of students. "Pan of what goes along 
with a positive image is responding to 
allegations of rape," she argues. 

But Clausen fears that the dilemma 
in addressing unreported rapes and 
assaults is cultural. 

"Investigations are often imbedded 
with woman- blaming. It is so wide- 
spread and so much a pan of our cul- 
ture thai it is difficult to determine 
how to respond," said Clausen. 

DenHartog wants to remind stu- 
dents that the campus police offers an 
escon service. 

■ "It isn't used much. I'd like to think 
its because people feel safe, but I 
know thb can't be the case for every- 
one" said DenHanog- 

"Wc do care." DenHanog coniin- 
ucs. "We want to know if there have 
beoi these 'urujetermined number of 
rapes' on campus. To me, the siu- 
denis' safety does come first,"

Is grade inflation 
an IPFW problem? 



By Fellclu Beeching 
Starr Writer 

Eighty-six percent of the people 
surveyed in the Fort Wayne News- 
Sentinel daily poll feci that there is a 
problem with grade inflation in local 
high schools and colleges. Grade in- 
flation can be defined as "students re- 
ceiving grades not appropriate for 
their actual ability level." 

Does IPFW have a problem with 
grade inClalion which has not been 
properly addressed on campus? 

First, examine the pn&gt;cc3s of adrtus- 
sion for IPFW students. There arc 
two procedures in the admissions pol- 
icy. Students who have graduated 
from high school in the past five 
years have strict guidelines for admis- 
sion, while older students have an 
"open door" policy. This means that 
recent high school graduates must 
conform to the college preparatory 
guidctirtes issued by die stale of Indi- 
ana. This includes three years of col- 
lege pteparalcry math, science, Eng- 
lish, and at least two yean of a for- 
eign language. Recent graduates must 
also score 800 or higher on the SAT, 

Older students must submit ihcir 
high school transcript and SAT scores 
if available. They must lake the 
placement test Career Services offers. 
GED graduates have to score al least 
52 out of 75 10 be regularly adnuttcd 
srudcnts. Plus, they also have to score 
at least 800 on the SAT- 



Som 



belie 



: that 



jiyonc 



vith 



money can attend IPFW, In a loose 
sense this is true, especially with old- 



er students. But what is the purpose 
of a school like IPFW7 Is it to serve 
the local community or to be a Har- 
vard or Princeton wamiabe? Exclu- 
sivcncss is not the name of the game 
here at IPFW. Competency is. 

Competency at the college level can 
include remediation. Remedial cours- 
es arc a fact of life at every state col- 
lege across the United Stales. We 
agree that college is not Ihe ideal 
place to team high school skills, but 
for those students who didn't receive 
them, do we punish Ihe victim? Let's 
not confuse remediation with grade 
inflation. 

I have not personally seen profes- 
sors inflating grades on this campus. I 
have seen teachers make allowances 
for sickness, having babies, injiuies 
from serious auto accidents, etc. For- 
tunately, they allow life along with 
their students' academic lives. But al- 
lowances don't translate into less vig- 
orous work for students, just compas- 
sion and more time for students lo ac- 
complish their goals. 

Whal about the opposite scenario — 
where die professor became antsy be- 
cause too many people were doing 
well on the exams, and he didn't want 
to give out A's to JO pwrcent of the 
class? If siudcnis earned it. why ixit? 

Education should rwt be a privilege 
of the ehte. All snidenu that desire to 
work for a college education, regard- 
less of what kind of unpriviledged 
background, should have access to re- 
mediation if necessary to reach those 
goals.

Alumnus lobbies to improve IPFW management 



TolheExlUor: 

As a member of Hoosicrs for High- 
er Education and a long-lime commu- 
niiy lobbyist for ctlucaiion funding 
anii refonn, 1 was tJIsappoimed by ihc 
disorganization of the local lobby, es- 
pecially where IPFTiV is conccmoJ. 

Thanks to Representative Winficld 
Moses. Icgiiimaie questions concern- 
ing hcavy-hantlcd absentee lantllords 
from Piuilue were called lo task, and 
thanks lo some good brave students, 
along with faculiy, a beiicr local man- 
agement agreement was established. 

As an IPFW and lU alumnus (two 
years at IPFW. iwo years at Bloom- 



ingion), my greatest university mem- 
ory was the massive siudcni lobby 
and march on the siaiehousc of 1969. 
organized from lU by then siudcni 
body vicc-presideni, Paul Hclmkc. 
Unlike ihis year's weak and frankly 
ambivalent delegation, we were thou- 
sands strong and secured the last 
great increase in university funding in 
Indiana History, You folks need some 
of that "old" GO'S spirit and confi- 
dence in your guts, like I'm sure 
some of your faculty remember. Your 
final goal has matured into the need 
for real autonomy for IPFW, the Uni- 
verisiy of Fort Wayne is ready! 



In working witli an ever-growing 
group of high school students who 
are taking real leadership roles in 
iheir govcmmenial affairs 1 know Utai 
a faith in the system is absolute, that 
never-say-dic attitude of hope and 
confidence. With all the sophisiica- 
lion of ihe Hoosiers for Higher Edu- 
cation lobby in terms of funtling and 
technically corrcci timing, there was 
no fire in the belly of confidence. 
There needs lo be one last push, am] 
this lime a real one as Ihe special ses- 
sion is readied. Local leaders like Mr. 
Moses and Mr. Sinks are ready to 
hear your call, but many of you don't 



even have tlieir n 

Get your Hoosiers for Higher Edu- 
cation postcards off, thai gets you on 
(he mailing lists. If you were earlier, 
it got you a silly litilc mini ba.skctball, 
What it won't get you is a local grass- 
roots organtzaiion that must come 
from your own soul (and maybe even 
the student government). Those of us 
wiLh experience at winning in the leg- 
islature are ready to help. Call me 
evenings at 693-9244, Otherwise, gel 
ready for a bigger tuition bill next 
year! 

Sincerely,

Students view euthanasia as family issue 



By F.L, Douse and 
Jennifer Borden 

F: Welcome to the first edition of 
He Said, She Said. Discussing the 
topic with me is my counierpoint 
parmcr Jennifer Borden, Our topic for 
this issue of the Communicator is: eu- 
thanasia, Jen, how would you define 
euthanasia? 

J: Well, it is the killing of human 
life. Isn't that basically what euthana- 
sia is? 

F; I would define it as the termina- 
tion of someone else's life by a loved 
one due to the patient's medical con- 
dition, whether thai is a vegetative 
stale or comatose state of existence. 
J: 1 don'i agree with it. It's not 
right. It's the killing of human life 
and that is wrong. 
F: Based on what? 
J: The fact thai the people are alive; 
therefore, it is wrong to kill them. It's 
not like you can sit around and say. 
"Oh. someone's in a coma. They're 
never going lo come around, let's jusi 
pull the plug. 

F: You have to look at the emoiional 
stress the family is going through. It 
takes a lot of time, energy and money 
10 lake care of someone on life sup- 
port. When the decision is made to 
take someone off support. I'm sure 
it's not made on the basis of. "Well, 
we're out of bucks — so Aunt Mary's 
got to go. 

People may consider this materi- 
alistic, but you have to look at the 
economic burden it places on the pa- 
tient's family. The money is not al- 
ways going to be there. If it comes 
down to putting a roof over my fami- 
ly's head or keeping a vegetable 
alive. I'm afraid I have to take care of 
my family because they are here. 
That comatose person may never 
wake up. 



J: The burden is heavy, but if you 
can see your loved one come out of 
it. make it through Ihe struggle and 
hardship of not knowing if they will 
woke up as you put it, then die benefit 
is your own. 

F: So I'm supposed to end up home- 
less. I don'i think so. 
J: No one said you'd end up home- 
less, 

F: But. if 1 put my last dime into 
keeping this person alive and the 
bank takes my house, where am I 
supposed to stay? That is an extreme 
case but it still needs to be looked at. 
J: It does need to be looked at, but 
you can go homeless from day lo day 
activity. 

F; 1 will agree with that. But, I think 
one sdl! has to take into consideration 
how much it cosis not only the fami- 
ly, but insurance agencies. With the 
current health care situation, people 
are going to be making those tough 
decisions. You also have to look at 
the emotional stress of the family. It 
takes a lot of faith and energy lo go 
day by day wondering, "When will 
Aunt Mary come back, or die?" I'm 
sorry, but I think there should be 
some type of limit before one can say 
we have waited long enough. 
J: But how can you set a limit when 
people have diR'erent financial situa- 
tions? When they have different fi- 
nancial situations and emotional ca- 
pabilities, the limits should be set by 
the families themselves. 
F; So, if a family found out that a 
family member was in an accident 
that put them in a coma, and the fam- 
ilies then decided to let them die af- 
ter a day, that would be okay? 
J: For myself, no. But how can you 
decide how someone else would feel? 
F: I ihink we can't answer that ques- 
tion together because people are indi- 



viduals. 

J; What about the emotional stale of 
Ihe patient? They are lying there 
wanting lo be a pan of life, but they 
can't be because their body hasn't 
had enough lime to recover from in- 
jury. 

F: And what about the irreversible 
damage done to bodies? Or is that a 
different situation? 
J: Weil, with any accident you're 
going to have some lype of irre- 
versible damage. 

F: So, you mean if someone is in a 
car ace idem and ends up a vegetable, 
their state of being is unconscious 
and they will not (according lo our 
medical technology) reium to the lev- 
el of a functioning human being, we 
are supposed to keep this person in 
that state of being? 
J; When they come out of it, they 
are a pan of society. And they can 
leach doctors from what they enperi- 
ence. But if they are brain dead, let 
them go, because there is no hope 
then. But if there is some brtun.wave 
activity then let them live, 
F: But that is condonmg passive eu- 
thanasia. 

J: Let it go the natural way. 
F: Do you mean withhold feeding 
tubes? 
J I No! 

F: What do you mean? Are you say- 
ing that active euthanasia is wrong? 
And passive euthanasia is okay? Be- 
cause if you are, then there must be a 
divisive line between active and pas- 
sive euthanasia. If you say pulling 
the plug on a patient is active, how do 
you define withholding food from 
someone? 

J: The only way you could withhold 
food is if the brain is dead. Withoui a 
br^ you can't function. You should 
let the body go. It's a decision thai 



the family has to make. 
F: But, what about people who are 
in comas? Their brain fs not necessar- 
ily functioning, SO they are hooked up 
lo feeding lubes. Why can't we with- 
hold food from them? 
J: Because they arc still alive. Their 
body may not look alive, but die way 
the coma operates is to shut down the 
body allowing time to heal naturally. 
Medical technology can coniinuc the 
healing process afterward. Therefore, 
they should be given food because 
their brain is still functioning. What 
good is a body, if you don't have a 
brain? 

F: But there is still the definition of 
what is considered active and passive 
euthanasia. With your eiample, if we 
withhold the medical attention be- 
cause the family couldn't afford it, 
would thai be wrong, and considered 
euthanasia? Without ircatmeni. the 
patient would die, 

J: That would have to be an issue 
that the family decides. There have 
been families that have wailed years, 
and the family member reiums from 
the coma. Then there are some fami- 
lies that feel they have wailed long 
enough. And maybe that is good for 
them and the patient. 
F: I think you hit it right on the nose 
when you said it was a family deci- 
sion. I'd like to take thai a step fur- 
ther by saying it is a private matter 
that is to be handled only by the fami- 
ly with medical advice from doctors. 
There are too many groups on both 
sides who are sticking their noses in 
other people's business to advance 
dieir own private agendas.

Aunt Louise advises wife to 'catch the snake' 




Dear Aunt Louise, 
I have a problem- I've 

been married for 10 years 
and the activity in my bed- 
room has decreased over 
the last few rrjonths. I have 
tried everything from serv- 
ing oysters at dinner to 
wearing sexy lingerie and

do? 



Dear Sexless, 

It sounds like someone is 
skimming the cream off 
your pitcher of milk. In oth- 



er words, someone else is 
getting the best of your 
man. When thai happens, 
someone has got to spit 
some teeth. 

What you need lo do. 
honey, is to Stan checking 
his clothes for skunk- 
smellin' perfume, siray 
hairs, and strange lipstick. 

If you find some snake in 
your chicken coop stealing 
your eggs, honey. I suggest 
you nip it in the bud What 
you need to do is invite that 
heifer out to lunch and tell 
her that he's got 5 other 
wives and 25 children to 



boDL After you tell hef that, 
she'll be in the next county 
before she can Finish her

Dear Power High, 

Honey, this is regresiive.

As we all know, there have been

I mean it! Just where Ihe hell has

Maybe he doesn't care aboul what

about it. 

Some people have speculated that 
maybe Ehrlich has his own private 



student body president; Jerry agenda, like fiscal autonomy at Indi- 
Richardson, vice-president of legis- 
lation; Michael Hell, vice-prcsideni 
of finance, and Mclinda Williams, 
vice-president of student affairs and

on a single subject to debate their 
own points of view. Be sure to look 
at this week's He Said, She Said top- 
ic: euthanasia. 

By the way — my dear friend, Fe- 
licia Bceching will be returning as a there was a recommendaiit 




ana Umversiiy-Purdue University al 
Indianapolis. Things that make 
you go, Hmmmm! 

As far as gossip goes, the only 
things I tiave for you are tidbits. 

You didn't hear it from me, but all 
of you smokers better pay attention. 
Now, I wrote in my last column that 
I from 



writer for The Communii 
sure wc all remember her irulh 
telling saga with Purdue President 
Steven Bcering (We haven't forgot- 
ten about you, Steven!), So, contin- 
ue to watch in the paper for Felicia's 
articles. 

Since I mention Bcering's name, I 
think the managcmcm agreement 
needs to be addressed again, but tliis 
lime from a different viewpoint. 
People on this campus have been 
taking cheap shots at the Purdue ad- 
ministration. I'm not aiiacking those 
people because I've slammed Pur- 



the Student Senate to ban smoking 
in the fireside lounge in Walb 
Memorial Union, Well folks, I read 
a document that Joaime B. Laniz 
sent to the faculty and staff staling 
that after August 6, there will be no 
more smoking in that television 
lounge. The only place you will be 
allowed 10 smoke is in the blue din- 
ing room in the cafeieria downsiairs 
in Walb. Is that fair? I don't know. 
But. you need to look into it if you 
feel your rights as a student arc be- 
ing violated. 
There have been rumors going 



around campus ihat 
there have been 
several rapes on 
campus ihai were 
covered up. I hear 
these rumors were 
created from flyers 
__Ma.^^__ posted in the park- 
ing garage and other places. 

1 have a message to whoever put 
Ihe flyers up. Number one: We all 
know how sensitive the lopic of rape 
is in society. So, why post flyers that 
arc going to cause more anxiety for 
women on campus, especially when 
you really have no proof? 

Now, I may be wrong. You may 
have evidence to back up your 
claim. If so. present it to The Com- 
municaior so we can investigate. 

The second message is to sign your 
name on the flyers. If you're just 
putting flyers up with no representa- 
tion for yourself or ihe group you're 
affiliated with, ii jusi shows that you 
are only trying to stir up the batter 
so you can have your cake as if 
you're Betty Crocker. If you really 
arc serious, take pride in what you 
believe and make it known to every- 
one. This isn't an issue to be joking 
with, alright? 

Recendy. I took time out to really 
get in touch wiih life. So, I went to 
the lOih Iniemaiional AIDS Candle- 
light Memorial, h was touching to 
sec all of the people from different 
ethnic backgrounds and sexual ori- 
entation united. As we all know, 
AIDS is a disease that doesn't dis- 
CTiminaie, 
The most touching moment was 
when I saw a high school friend of 
mine and found out how AIDS had 
affected his family. The conversa- 
tion made me reali/j; the magnitude 
of the disease. It has no boundaries 
at all. 

For all of you who are having sex, 
please use a condom. The last thing 
any of us would like lo sec is anoth- 
er person infected with this disease. 
By the way, Ihc pop machine diat 
was in the student activiiics room is 
no longer there. It is located across 
from the computer lab on the first 
floor of Walb. The reason for mov- 
ing the machine is because some 
people in that area were putting chili 
in the machine. I think we can all 
figure out who may be responsible 
for thai, though of course I am not 
one 10 mention names or organiza- 
tions. 

Oh, well, dial's all of the gossip, 
gossip, gossip 1 have for this week. 
Until nexl time, remember you 
didn't hear it from me!

Activities Editor 

Nicotine is a highly addictive dnig. It 
ii listed in the Diagnostic and Slalisii- 
cal Manual of Mental Disorden as 
"Tobacco Dependence," in the same 
category as "Substance Abuse Disor- 

Nicotine is as addictive as heroin and 
cocaine, according to the Surgeon Gen- 
eral. The smoker of cigaiwtcs is an ad- 
dict. 

Nicotine is a pMison. Nicotine is used 
as the effective agent in insecticide 
sprays, A quantity of nicotine equal to 
one-fiflh of an aspirin tablet can be 
deadly, A dose of 60 mg, of nicotine is 
about the right amount to cause death 
in an adult. The average cigar can con- 
tain two lethal doses of nicotine. A cig- 
arette contains 20 to 30 mg, of nico- 

Nicotinc poisoning, as rapid as 
cyanide, can cause death within a few 
minutes. Death results from respiratory 
failure caused by paralysis of die mus- 
cles of respiration. 

Luckily, not all the nicotine present in 
a cigarette or cigar is carried by the lar 
smoke to the lungs for absorption. Too, 
nicotine is continually removed from 
die body through the kidneys or smok- 
ers would be dropping dead just like 
the beetles and fleas that are sprayed 
with nicotine insecticide sprays. 

It is the addiction to nicotine which 
keeps smokers smoking while it is poi- 
soning Uicir bodies and those of others, 
says Julia C. Bccman, in Counselor's 
"Speaking Out" 



Even so. "addict" is a difficult word 
for the user because the social implica- 
tions of diis title bring lo mind foulness 
and crime. No one wants to think of Uie 
IPFW smoker, the one standing out in 
the rain, sleet and humidity of die sea- 
sons in order to smoke, as an addict. 

However, addressing smoking as an 
addiction and acquiring more infonna- 
tion about the drug nico- 
tine could lead lo a better 
understanding for both 
non-smokeis and smokers 
of why smokers inhale a 

From the non-smoker. 

sympathy for the smoker's 
frustrations v/ith his addic- 
tion can only insure in the 
fumre dial ihc dcmarcadon 
zone between the smoking 
and non -smoking sections 
remains safe territory. And 
maybe, the smoker can get 
some solid help and sup- 
port from a society that 
seems at limes to want to 
exile the smoker rather 
dian help cure an addict. 

Information about nicotine addiction 
or calling die smoker an addict would 
be unwanted information for the tobac- 
co industry. Since the tobacco compa- 
nies spend mega millions in magazine 
advertising, "An Addict Docs Marl- 
boro's" is not going to be a feature sto- 
ry foimd on the newsstand. 

The negative "addiction" information 
is. rather, foimd in pamphlets distrib- 
uted by drug abuse agencies like 




DARE ind Gateway Outreach Center. 
Here, nicotine is listed in the same cat- 
egory as other chemical substances to 
which people arc addicted: alcohol, 
cocaine, sleeping pills and tranquiliz- 
ers. As to the power of the addiction, 
one in ten users of alcohol will become 
addicted, virtually every cigarette 
smoker is addicted, says the American 
Cancer Society. 

Smokers vary in 
their addiction. Inhaled 
smoke from a cigarette 
may deliver from 2.0 mg 
loO.l mg of nicotine. De- 
pending on the number 
and brand smoked, the 
smoker may have a 40.0 
mg or a 2.0 mg per day 
habit. 

The cigarette com- 
panies know about brand 
loyalty. What smokers of- 
ten don't know is that the 
brand smoked is helping 
to maintain the addiction 
at a cenain level and is de- 
livering the required "fix" 
they have come to need. 

In principle, the smoker with die less 
heavy demand for nicotine will have an 
easier dme quitting. This is pan of the 
reasoning behind the nicotine transder- 
mal system, "the patch," being pre- 
scribed by physicians. By reducing the 
level of nicotine, as Ihc patches be- 



come smaller, the smoker can lessen 
the addiction, maybe avoid some of the 
withdrawal symptoms, and still be- 
come free of the addiction when the 
90-day program ends. For sure, the 
smoker will he freed from approxi- 
mately 5300 for die e.xpense of the pro- 
gram. 

The American Cancer Society docs 
not support the use of the nicotine 
"patch." A spokesperson for the Soci- 
ety says that the only quitting method 
the organization supports is "cold 
turkey" because otherwise the individ- 
ual is still getting nicotine into the 
bloodstream. 

And, "cold turkey" is what the rdco- 
linc addict dreads and fears the most, 
because it means no cigareues will be 
available when the craving starts. The 
mere idea of total abstinence brings a 
preference for peeling the skin from 
one's fingers just for fun radicr dion 
suffer the discomfort of mcotine widi- 
drawal. 

Ironically enough, it is the fear of 
physical discomfort from withdrawal 
symptoms that helps to keep the smok- 
er smoking. 

Meanwhile, at the cigarette compa- 
nies, brand managers have a rather 
easy job knowing that the smoker of 
their product is hooked and can't even 
get up in die morning, drive a cor. toko 
a coffee break, write an essay or study 
for an exam without a "fix "
