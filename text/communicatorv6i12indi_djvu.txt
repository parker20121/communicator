The guidelines require that student activity card holders be given priority ■;,

also lays down guidelines for publicizing ticket sales.

two weeks before the program. The first week only those with student activity 
cards could claim tickets The second week the tickets could also be purchased by

The system worked well. Those programs that were sell nul.s. such u Paul 
Harvey and Gloria Steinem, came off relatively tree of complaints from students 
with cards but no tickets. 

The bill would prevent policies like I hemic used by the Sludenl Union Hoard lor
