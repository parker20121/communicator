Reforming campaigns 



Campaign finance reform has 
been an important issue in this 
year's presidential campaign, but 
there's no need lo wait for legisla- 
tors to push for change. 

There's a promising and inno- 
vative proposal on Ihe tabic thai

Washington gridlock. It involves 
changing Ihe habits and practices of 

paigns happen on television. 

Farmer presidents Jimmy 
Carter and Gerald Ford, and former 
CDS anchorman Walter Cronkiic 
have called on the nation's broad- 
casicis to open the airwaves to five 



icred discouru in Ihe 30 nights 
before the election. That's five min- 
utes a nighl of substance-the candi- 
dates talking about issues in stump 
speeches, issue forums, interview or 
mini -debates. 

These segments could be 
embedded into news or news maga- 
zine programs, or presented in s)oU 
carved out elsewhere in Ihe evening 
television lineup. The goal is lo cre- 
ate a forum for candidate discourse 
that routinely teaches television's 
broad audience nighl after night in 
the closing weeks of a campaign.
