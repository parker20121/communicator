Jeff Gibson 
resists draft 

Jeff Gibson, philosophy 
major at Purdue, was indicted 
Sept. 25 and arrested Tues- 
day, Oct, 5 for resisting 
the draft. 

He has opposed the selec- 
tive service system and its 
implications, "that a man's 
life belongs totally to the 
state and not to himself. " 

Gibson has OTganized the 
Fort V/ayne Draft Resistance 
and has been active in 
draft counseling. 

His arraignment will be 
in approximately three weeks 
at which time he will leam 
the date of his court hear- 
ing. 

His bond was set at 
&amp;5OOO, due to the inter- 
pretation of a speech he 
gave here on campus last 
year. 

DuriDR the Peace and 
Poverty Day last year, he 
gave a speech concerning 
non-violence and draft re- 
sistance. 

In the speech, he ex- 
plained that leaving the 
country in order to avoid 
the draft solved the prob- 
lem for the individual, but 
that it had no worth to the 
draft resistance movement. 

He said that he himself 
would stay home and suffer 
the consequences if indict- 
ed. 

An FBI agent who had re- 
corded the speech interpre- 
ted it during a 'grand jury 
investigation prior to Gib- 
son's indictment. 

The federal marshal told 
him that during the inves- 
tigation, the agent inter- 
preted the speech to mean 
that if he were indicted, 
Gibson would go to Canada. 

Consequently, Gibson's 
bail was set at K5000. 




Gibson reacted, "Ghandi 
once said that if a state 
must put a man in prison 
for doing nothing morally 
wrong, it shows only how 
weak that state is. I think 
this certainly applies in 
this case,"

Mort Sahl to speaK0ct.13 



Mort Sahl will be featured 
in a free-wheeling pro^rain of 
humor and satire on the Indiana- 
Purdue Fort Uayne Campus Wed- 
nesday, Oct, 13, 8 p.m., in the 
Student Lounge. 

Tickets were made available 
for Sahl ' s lecture Wednesday. 
They may be obtained at the Of- 
fice of Student Services. 

I'iort Sohl is a funny and witty 
man who is no respecter of per- 
sons. For more than a few years 
he has been deflating the egos 
of the week and the mighty, 
particularly the country's top 
politicians and world leaders 
who make the daily headlines. 

In his own inimitable fashion, 
r.ort Sahl frequently interrupts 
his own remarks with unpredic- 
table "one-liners" that bring 
down the house. In a day when 
everybody is "telling it like 
it is," it is refreshing to 
find someone who still man- 
ages to "tell it like it isn't," 

During the past year, he 
has appeared on 52 network tel- 
evision talk shows and variety 
shows and he is presently 
working on the first part of his 
au t ob iography . 

It is particularly liis tours 
of colleges and nightclubs that 




KORT SAHL 
keeps him busy. Now that a 
whole new generation has dis- 
covered his record albums, his 
pungent cracks at' the Estab- 
lishment, and his unique aware- 
ness of what's going on in the 
world, he is usually popular 
with college students. 



Student Union announces plan 



The lU'Purdue Student 
Union Board has announced 
future plans for activi- 
ties here. 

A dance in the student 
lounge next Friday, Oct. 15, 
will feature the East Bank, 
a well known local group. 

Admission is free to 
activity card holders and 
31 to all other persons, 

Dan Tonkel and Boger 
Nordeen, co-chairmen of the 
annual Penny Carnival, are 
now soliciting help to make 
the carnival a success. 

Proceeds from the Nov. 15 
carnival will go to Switch- 
board, Tonkel said he felt 
students would be more re- 
ceptive to the idea of mak- 
ing Switchboard the reci- 
pient of earnings. 

Any group of students may 
set up a booth for the car- 
nival. Location and origi- 
nality will be distributed 
on a first come, first serve 
basis. 

Children from, hopefully, 
the Allen County Children's 



Home, Project Head Start, and 
the State School will be on 
hand for students to enter- 
tain. 

The Penny Carnival is or- 
ganized so that a student 
can adopt a child for the 
evening, and treat him to 
carnival activities at a 
small expense to the student, 

Melanie Fiskus is in 
charge of supplying children 
for the program. Any infor- 
mation for her regarding the 
children should be left in 
the SUB mailbox in the lounge. 

The Union Board is also 
now in the process of plan- 
ning activities for the Win- 
ter Carnival and Harbar Ai^ 
bar Days. 

Union Board members, in 
an effort to satisfy more 
people this year, is soli- 
citing suggestions from all 
students. 

A suggestion box is now 
in the loimge by room 106. 
Students are encouraged to 
submit suggestions for events, 
groups, and activities.

"Hixon should stay home and

-Jim fioehm 

Dear Editor: 

I was a member of the 
"Nads" — play the guys, have 
a lot of fun football — but 
it appears that from the 
onset of the scrimmage on 
Sunday the guys were not 
out to have fun. 

Our team were not pros, 
nor were we amateurs, but 
we did enter the game with 
the idea of playing foot- 
ball as we know how to play 
it. 

The rules were explicit- 
ly stated and both teams 
were to comply. Nov/ where 
in the rules does it state 
that clipping, tackling, 
kicking and slugging are 
allowed? Boys, is it nece- 

Girls are girls — be 
they athletically inclined 
or not. We can take part of 
what you dish out but not 
broken bones or even broken 
spirits. 

Our game is over, but 
the team, "The Train," will 
be notorious, for the Nads 
are working on the other 
teams that will play them. 
Hopefully, they will soon 
get a taste of their own 
medicine. 

P.S. They may have put 
a few of us out of commis- 
sion, but the spirit of 
the girls and the spirit 
for the game has not been 
diminished.

Lear Editors: 

. There have been r^any in-

lAt's free Chir.o Week. Held

tion to Nixon's present China 
policies.

Dear Editor, 

Last Saturday I wit- 
nessed our Indiana-Iurdue 
soccer team display their 
talents as they defeated 
the O.S.U. team. 

Ky knowledge of the 
game is somewhat limited, 
yet, I was impressed with 
the play of two indivi- 
duals. 

I am also sure that this 
team has a good deal of 
potential to go on and be- 
come a better team. 

If this team lacks the 
all-star talent, the team 
certainly makes up for it 
in true spirit. I can only 
urge the students of our 
school to watch this team 
as I did. 

Thank you, 
Brock Able

Dear Editors: 

Is victor;.- so sweet as to 
be i.TOurht i±t the destruction 
of our opponents? 

Does glor:/ lie in the hum- 
iliation of others? Is success 
so important that our hunrer 
for it becomes insatiable? 

And is valor so hif^hly es- 
teeced that our blood flows 
hot vjith the desire to ach- 
ieve des:-.ite the nieacs we 
use? It seems that a num- 
ber of our students think so. 

Case in point: Sunday af- 
ternoon Football. 

As the girls of both the 
Kads and the Beavej s took 
the field and faced their re- 
spective all-irale teems for 
the kick-offs they were ex- 
pectinr to play a siir.ple game 
of flag football. 

Unfortunately this was not 
to be the si-tuation. From the 
first play to the last whist- 
le they were beaten and phy- 
sically mistreated by every 
me:::ber of the so-called men's 
team. 

The men amused tJiemselves 
betweeii touchdowns by throw- 
ing elbows, forearms rand ex- 
cessively jard blocks at the 
girls. (This is one way of 
proving . our virility!) 

The defense seemed to ^have 
no knowledge of how to pull 
a flag as 9 out of 10 times 
the girl ' s running backs found 
themselves firmly planted en 
the ground when trj'inf to move 
the ball. 

Where is the glory in phy- 
sicallv mutilatiniT a woman? 
Is it necessary/ to mangle legs 
and toes to have a competitive 
r,ajne of football? 

'.Ihen it came time to shake 
hands after the g^me the op- 
position laughed in the face 
01 the opponents. 

Good sportsr.arship fellows: 
the exajnple you have set was 
truly nauseating!

cludinp: three of the top four. 
Nebraska, first; Kichi^an, se-

Giant shadows, cast on the 
walls, 

Seemignly mine. 

How strange. 

^orr;ething I alone have. 

Shadows are here to comfort 

you. 

Never put out the light, 

To turn off you shadow 

And destroy you uniqueness. 

It is yours alone. 

Keep a lig-ht. 

No matter how dim, 

Cast towards you. 

And portray only yourself,

Braun organizes Youth 
for Zeis campaign 

-■ — [' nuL.her of .students here 
fron tl-je Hep-ional Campus have 
volunterod nnd are now v/orkir:g 
for the re-election of I,a.yor 
iiarold iicis in the up-conjing 
City elections. Most are in- 
volved in a frroup called, 
"Youth for Zeis." 

"Youth for Zeis," an orp^rn- 
ization of well over a hund- 
red .vounc people, was organiz- 
ed durinf^ this past summer by 
an Ini:;iana University sopho- 
more, Charlos Braun. 

Draun, who is a pre-law 
student ma;iorinr in Political 
Science and tilosoph;;, has 
been active in politics for a 
nurber of yars, especially 
in 1^?0 when lie wa£: 1 resident 
of "Youth for Adair." 

.ilso active is Glenn iimley, 
an l.U. politic. ] science stu- 
dent, w'lo serves on the YFL 
Steerinp; ooroirdttee. 

j'monr others active are 
I'Erie I'.iller, Eric Forsa, 
Hoderick j/awson, and Uave and 
Gail Doell. 

In reference to "Youth for 
i^eis" Braun had this to say, 
"I sincerely believe this is 
the best i-Olitical yout'!: group 
that has ever been organized 
here in ■'■'ort Wayne. We are 
all deoicated tc one -oal — 
the re-election of a very 
successful Eind dedicated pub- 
lic servant, Harold t.. Zeis." 

Tonight at the Mayor's home 
located at 5217 Dania Court, 
berir-rinr ^t 7 p.r.. , there is 
going to be a youth "rap ses- 
sion" iiith the I'layor. Any- 
one interested in attending 
is welcome.

Also scheduled is the group's 
first organizational meeting. 

The French croup can be 
found Thursday^from, 11:50 a.m, 
to 1:50 p. re. seated at a marl:- 
ed table in the cafeteria. 

Originally the group gath- 
ered together just to converse 
in French while they ate their 
lunches, but the idea caught 
on and soon noncollege members 
of the comciunity begsin to at- 
tend sessions. 

Now the group is planning 
to form into a chartered or- 
ganization. A meeting to dis- 
cuss these plans will be held 
at 7 p.m., Oct. 10, at the 
Village Club, Schoaff Park A- 
partments, 6500 Bt, Joe 'Koad, 
Fort Wayne. 

Planned for the near future 
is a trip to the University 
of Michigan at ^mn Arbor on 
Oct. II; or 16 to see Karcel 
Marceau. 

Anyone interested in attend- 
ing and sharing expenses is 
asked to contact V\ts, Wiegman

APO, Circle K to 

collect old books 
for reformatory 

n drive tc collect used 
books for an inmate library' 
at the Indiana btate Reforma- 
tory' begins on this ceinpus 
today and continues until next 
Friday, Oct. 15. ' 

The usec-book drive is a 
service project of Alpha Fhi 
Omega and Circle K. This is 
the first tine that the two 
service fraternities have 
worked together on a project. 

In a written plea Mr. Merle 
Wise, librarian at the Indiana 
State Reforr^atorj' said, "There 
are about JC young nien trying 
to take the college courses 
but without books it is kind 
of useless. I ar l.cping that 
ir.aybe jou could raise some mon- 
ey, or h:v£ soisg books donat- 
ed, from the colleges there." 

All faculty and students 
are urged to contribute books 
next week from 8:30 until 5-30. 
The books can be deposited at 
the Circle K coat check room 
which is en the first floor 
near the front entrance of the 
building. 

The reformatory has a spec- 
ial need for looks in the a- 
reas of math, business, soc- 
iology, government, psychology, 
and philosoph;'. 

The fraternities Eire also 
trying to locate used business 
machines to contribute to the 

prison. 

Chairing the project is 

Denny Berghof'.

Convo committee reviewed 

From the President's desk

Mark 

Franke 



Over tais past sumcer, def- 
inite and Eipnificant steps 
were taken to consolidate stu- 
dent control of r:&gt;:penditure 
of student activity fee H.cni- 
es. The area in which this 
can best be i-lustrated is the 
ConvocstiocE series. 

For the laft three years, 
the Convocations Coninittee 
was coirposed of students frorr. 
the £.tudent Union Board and 
adrinictr^tors from the Office 
of Student Services. 

The students, who were 
priiiiarily interested in the 
Union Board and its social 
planning, took very little, 
if any, interest ir the cul- 
tujal planning. 

Early in June we resolved 
to brin"- the Convocations 
Comirittee under the direct 
control of the stucents. 
This was not meant to be a 
criticsni of the quality of 
the proframs: selected by 
the Student Services. 



ATTENTION STUDENTS:

ed to our proposal. 

The feasibility of bring- 
ing Superstar to Fort V/ayne 
v/as inve?.tic-ate(' by students, 
a supplementary Blloc^tion was 
appropriated to the Committee 
by the Student Senate to cov- 
er the additional costs of 
"Superstar"; the publicity 
was handled by the Students' 
Government Tress Secretriry, 
Jotin Tjann. 

All aspects of the progrsjii 
were co-ordinated by Sharon 
Gabei. ; everj' last detail was 
expedited by students. The 
Committee did rely on the ad- 
ministration for a legal com- 
mittment when litigation was 
threatened. 

I-embers of the Committee 
resronsible for such work 
are": Sharon Gabet ana Mark

It Sf. ms strrrnpe to be 
C( lisiderinp: intra-nural Tluf 
footbfcll from a sociolopical 
viewpoint, but after seeinf; 
last bunday's action I caji 
hardly avoid tr: inr to make 
soFie sense out of what I saw. 
I was horril.ly repelled by 
tlie treatment received ^y the 
girls v:hen they dtired to step 
out onto the rridiron against 
the boys. It seemed as if 
they had invaded the male "Holy 
of Holies," and had to be dri- 
ven out. 

I will frrant that football 
is a rourh sport: two Charley- 
horses and a ^jacjiied t'.uir.b 
serve as first hand eviaence. 
But, I maintain that there 
is notl-ino- at sti^l:e that re- 
quires a fTUy to knock a pirl 
out, kick her in the head af- 
ter she's out of bounds, in- 
tentionally clip her, blinc- 
side her, or flbow her in the 
face. 

All of the;p and inort; I 
observed. Une pirl's fcce 
WHS shoved ir to the dirt, a- 
nother Ral wt:- it full forct; 
when she went i^ for a pass; 
a couple core were taken out 
of the gp-iiie b: o^.e r -j who 
continued to roij-'* up the 
survivors. 

The next day he apo o- 
gir.ed. 

Wh-- 1 occurred T;hat caused 
the f-uys tc ro after the *_ 
eirls so intor.selyV Did they 
feel thoir collective manhood 
was at stake': Were the;- 
tiireatened by the thoufht 
that the ?;irl£ trifht be able 
to not oiil;; under£:tanc , but 
to ;lay football': 

I could iilmost hear an un- 
spoken "lifrrer, ret back ii. 
your proper place," as the 
assault UT:on t'ne lauies con- 
tinued. The feirale had dar- 
ed to clicb dov.n off her 
pedestal and act like s huc;- 
an beijip, and paternalisI:^ was 
not p-oinr to allov/ s^;, of that. 
The sane attitude that op- 
poses ninority equality wa.-: 
in force ap;Dinst coea coi - 
petition, and it really scar- 
ed ire. 

You see, I i-:an partially 
understand racial discrimin- 
ation, or at least I 'nave 
learned to tolerate it while 
working to eliminate it; 
b'lt I cannot understajid sex 
discrimination. 

We stand ready to defend 
our lady's honor at the drop 
of a snide remark^ we will 
batter eich other for the 



rirht to open her car door; 
tut, ,-lust let her step out of 
her assifTied role BnC we in- 
stinctively smash her if we 
iLust, to put her back in "her 
place." 

The whole idea of flag 
football as it was presented 
to Ee was that we would spend 
bunday afternoon in healthy 
exercii.-e and Rood-natured com- 
petition. 

It seems that there are 
some people on the field who 
disapree. 

If that is the case, ].er- 
haps we could divide up a 
bit differently than we are 
now. 

Division I could be com- 
posed of teems out for blood, 
and Division II could be peo- 
pled by those out for a plea- 
sant afternoon of exercise. 

lerhaps what I wo'.^ld like 
to see is best expressed by 
the followii-.f quotation: "A 
friend of ir.ine v/as a super- 
jock at Yale, but ir his sen- 
ior year be quit the varsity 
ice-hockey team. He oicani- 
zed a team where you had to 
have a beard to play. He chal- 
lenred Ithode Island School of 
Desiirn to a r^me, anr the two 
teams skated to the middle of 
the hockey rink cariyinr; their 
jerseys. They i(&gt;a^e a bi^ pile 
of then, then cnose up sides. 
That wai. "i.e..utiful. These 
were friex_dly, cheerful people 
aiic they v;ere Loinp amuiinr; 
tliir.cE. Their roal was to de- 
lir.,t themselves, not to de- 
feat each other"-K.urt VorJies-ut. 

Is that too mucu to 5£k? 
I hope not, at least so far 
as the p;irls ere concerried. 
Kemember, they don't havc- 
three years of Jr. Hifr-h, and 
four years of senior lii^h 
school football experience 
anc reflexes p;oin'^ for tneir..

Flag football 
season opens 

by Tom Penzone 



Several teams blasted 
their opponents ir. what prov- 
ed to be an ezcitinc opening 
weekend for the intracural 
flap; football season. 

The loEse, laf:t year's 
chairps, n.uscled their way to 
a 40-6 win over the Greasers. 
Both teams scored early in 
the contest, but tlie balance 
of povfer "uickly shifted vben 
the ;^osse's defensive line- 
man Ken l^cheibenber[^er, be- 
ran picking his v;a^, through 
the Gr-aser's front five. 

Tom Beaver threw t- touch- 
down passes and Wilbert Essex 
ran for 14 poir.ti;. 

Hoehn-noy's (H-K) teaa p-iive 
Walters and Evarts (W-E) team 
more than their share of hard 
times. 

H-E was explosively quick 
and stung U-E on several play 
action passes from the sure 
hand of their quarter-back, 
Bishop. 

Cook's team, last year's 
runner-up, battled Kreuse's 
team and finished the hour's 
play v/itb a twenty to nothing 
win. 

Aschbact-ier picked up an 
eas;) win over Farrell by for- 
feit. 

Woolem's Psych team also 
received a gift as Johnson's 
team failed to show. 

Ambrose's team blanked 
I-icI-iahon 52-0. 

The train literally creajn- 
ed the NADb 5^-0, in what prov- 
ed to be a r,Einful bui.day after- 
noon for the gals. The Beavers, 
defending women's ch.'imps also 
bit the dust as t;iev were wa]- 
loped by I erry-Keed 4-S-6. 

John Williams has placed 
two trash containers near the 
fields and has asked for as- 
sistance i:. keeping the park 
picked-up during the same. 

Also, only team captains 
are permitted to dispute calls 
made by the referees. 

Captains, if you wish to 
drop off a short suLjary of 
your winning efforts, we will 
print ther. in next weeks is-

Jeff Gibson went the way 
of all thinking flesh, a few 
days ago. They took him, 
and shaved him, and then 
they let him go. Can't love 
it, and they won't let him 
leave it. What's a Motha'

The Fort Waj-ne Komets bat- 
tle the Kuskepon I-iohawks in 
am exhibition hockey match 
tonight at t^e coliseun.. Face- 
off time is eiCO p.n. 

Collin Lister, Komet Busi- 
ne.s Manarer, is more than 
cii'timistic '^bout the K's ear- 
ly performance. He feels this 
year's crop of hopeful Komet's 
are at least GO,"i better than 
the 70-" 1 team. 

The 71-72 Konets, with 
Hh:;t seems to be a super in- 
crease in speed, should blast 
the lid off last years scor- 
ing statistics. 

Michel Briere. a Komet 
hopeful, scored 58 roals for 
the ituebec Remparts at left 
wing last hear. He worked 
the front line with Guy La- 
fleur who was this year's 
nurber one draft choice in 
the K'.L. 

Hovfever, at only 5'2", 
Briere will have to prove 
his worth here in the IHL be- 
fore pteping into an HHL ar- 
ena. 

Goalers, Irons and Keough, 
have returned for another year 
with the Konets. Their per- 
fornance in practice has been 
spectacular and it appears 
t'ce-j will acrain be tough to 
score agairst. 

As of Tuesday, 50 placers 
had reported to caij:;&gt; and the 
Koraot manuremrnt claims that

LAND OF ESCAPE 

A faraway place. 
Where I couldn't have been. 
Yet I seem to sense it's ex- 
istence. 

Rolling lumps of pillow-like 
green, 

Nestled and cuddled in the 
arms of earth. 
Tiny spots of colors. 
Bursting here, 

And there. 
Resembling pinwheels out of 
the past. 
A hidden cove. 
Designed by nature 
For myself and my kind. 
All my energy is stored in 
this faraway place. 
For existence there is life. 
Not here.

Baker had no chance for a 
save as Williams tip.ped the 
ball in for the opponents.

the 5rd quarter v;hen CSU 
coalie Danny I.iller w:.s kick- 
ed in the frice while diving 
for s loose ball. He was re-
