Education examined 



By MICHELE R. SHAFFER 
Managing Editor 

The Educational Policy Committee 
(EPCl of the School of Science and 
Humanities held an open forum 
Monday to discuss the adequacy of 
current general educational 
requirements and to propose changes 
in the current policies of the school, 

Approximately 11 people attended 
the meeting, which was open to all 
students and faculty. 

Jeff Wilson, chair of the committee, 
began the forum by explaining the role 
of the EPC is to reexamine the 
educational policies of the schools. 

James Bundschuh, dean of the 
School of Science and Humanities, 
then addressed the challenge of 
altering the schools' requirements. 
"The (present) general educational 
requirements are 10 years old. It is 
time to reexamine (them)," said 
Bundschuh. "The concept of what a 
general education is, is evolving." 

Bundschuh also identified the 
specific difficulties IPFW has in 
setting requirements. At most 
universities, there is one set of general 
educational requirements, one basic 
curriculum, for all, said Bundschuh. 
However, at IPFW, there is a different 
set within the Indiana University 
system and within the Purdue 
University system. There ace also 
differences within Lhe different schools 
within those respective systems, said 
Bundschuh. 

Another thing Bundschuh said he 
would like the EPC to do is define the 



differences between a bachelor of arts 
degree and a bachelor of science 
degree. Define them, said Bundschuh, 
"and see what should go into It (each 
degree), and make recommendations 
totheschool." 

Kenneth Bordens, assistant 
professor of psychological sciences, 
said another important area of con- 
cern is integrating the different 
disciplines. He emphasized the im- 
portanceof promoting critical thought, 
literacy, mathematical and scientific 
abilities in all courses. 

"Many students come in with the 
idea they're not going to be expected to 
integrate differeni subjects)," said 
Bordens "We have to somehow get 
them out of the mentality that what 
they're here to do is learn a trade or 
vocation." Bundschuh also em- 
phasized this, commenting that it must 
be kept in mind what kinds of things 
make someone a well-rounded person 
in today's society. 

"The best charge is to live well into 
the 21st century," said Bundschuh. 
"We've got to be very pro-active about 
liberal arts and sciences." 

The committee also addressed the 
need for assessing students abilities 
and academic competence at the end 
of a four-year program. Com- 
prehensive examinations in the major, 
or standardized exit examinations, 
. have been suggested. 

The Importance of this is evident, 
said Bordens "It doesn't look good to 
us as a university when students come 
out and. get jobs, but can't construct a 
simple sentence." 



Pornography discussed at Republicans meeting 



By EARL SMITH 
Chief Reporter 

Society is becoming more violent 
due to the increasing use of drugs, 
according to Allen County Prosecutor 
Stephen Sims. 

Speaking at the College 
Republican's meeting last Wednesday 
night, Sims discussed his view of the 
position of prosecutor in regard to the 
quality of life in Allen County. 

"The preservation of life is our main 
function," Sims said. While asking for 
the death penalty may not seem to be 
in accordance with this philosophy, 
Sims feels at times asking for and 
obtaining the death penalty may 
benefit society. 

A person who becomes addicted 
becomes enslaved to a drug dealer, 
Sims -said. His health and family 
relationships suffer and when there 
are insufficient funds to support his 
addiction, his job performance suffers 
and his view of human life changes. 

"At least 30 percent of the armed 
robberies lin Allen County) are drug 
related," Sims said. 

An example of this change occurred 
when a man walked inlo the Kentucky 
Fried Chicken store on Fairfield 
Avenue and told the clerk to give him 
some money or get his face blown up, 
Sims said. The robber had a beautiful 
wife, Children and a productive job 
when he started doing drugs, Sims 
said. 



There are Iwo types of drug houses 
in Fort Wayne: the "shooting gallery" 
and the "carry-out," Sims said. At a 
shooting gallery, one consumes the 
drug on the premises; each room of the 
house has a separate drug and an 
armed guard, he said. 

If one doesn't have cash, the 
"proprietor" will accept merchandise 
of comparable value which is often 
sold in Chicago or Detroit, Sims said. 
In this way, an addict becomes en- 
trapped in a pattern of continuing 
crime, which supplies organized crime 
with a flow of stolen merchandise, he 
said. 

Sims credits the ever increasing 
level of crime and violence with a 
parallel increase in drug use While 
fiscal year 1984 had the lowest 
homicide rate in approximately 
twenty years, fiscal year 1985 had the 
highest. One-half of the homicides 
were drug-realted, said Sims Many of 
the drug : rclated homicides were 
executions, he said. 

"Organized crime has (long) 
regarded America as a marketplace," 
Sims said Their products have been 
various drugs and pornography, he 
said. 

"Pornography is not nudity; por- 
nography is violence," Sims said. 
While we often think of pornography in 
terms of nudity that is not the issue, he 
said. "The fundamental issue is not 
whether we have the right to read 




anything, but should organized crime 
be able to sell material that is 
destructive to society,' ' Sims said. 

Sims said he has seen films in which 
nude women were tortured to death. 
"Torture" films have been sold in 
Allen County showing nude women 
hanging from a ceiling until certain 
body parts turned black from oxygen 
deprivation, he said. Sims said he 
didn't close Fort Wayne Books, the 
Erotica House, and Cinema blue to 
restrict anyone's reading privileges 



but to restrict the flow of money to 
organized crime. 

Those in organized crime consider 
jail terms a part of doing business, but 
when assets and profits are con- 
fiscated there is a chance to control an 
organization, Sims said. 

In regard to Fort Wayne Books and 
the others, there was a history of 42 
arrests, Sims said. For that reason he 
decided to use R.I, CO. and seize 
control of the property. 

R.I, CO. is an acronym for - 
Racketeer Influence and Corrupt 
Organizations, which allows police to 
seize property and profits such as in 
the case of a drug bust, Sims said. 

The case involving Fort Wayne 
books, the Erotica House, and Cinema 
Blue will be heard by the Indiana 
Appellate Court on March 24. Sims has 
been granted permission by the 
Attorney General to argue for the 
state; the other side is flying in 
Beverly Hills attorney John Weston, 
said Sims. 

"This is a case with national im- 
plications," Sims said. Previously 
police could not use R.I. CO, when. 
prosecuting pornography cases, Sims 
said. 

"Are we an open community (or 
organized crime?" Sims asked. He 
feels our community will be safer and 
less violent without drug dealers, 
pornography pushers and organized 
crime.

Stand by: we have 
technical difficulties 



II has been brought to our attention 
that yet another facet of the 
communications and theatre 
department seems to be experiencing 
technical difficulties. 

'- David Shaul, assistant professor of 

English and linguistics, is concerned 
about rumours surrounding Purdue- 
Indiana Theatre (PIT). He fears plans 
are afoot to create a requirement that all 
speaking roles be held by students. 
■ ''Informal interviews indicated that this 
is not a problem. It is for the most part, 
agreed that PIT should, at all costs, 
remain open to members of the 
community and not be relegated to 
performances by IPFW students, 

Denise Van Ort, theatre students and 
PIT veteran, believes that it is 
important for students to interact with 
members of the community, honing 
their craft through learning from others 
outside their environment." 

Larry Life, PIT director and 
instructor indicated that sometime in 
the 70s, an addendum read that 50 
percent of the full company — technical 
and cast — should be students. He 
believes that speaking parts were never 
singled out and added that the 
addendum was only for that specific 
year. 

Although Life doesn't feel that PIT is 
in danger of being overrun by actors 
from the community, he is dismayed 
about a chronic situation. It seems that 



the overall enrollment for theatre 
classes has increased, but the same 
people seem to audition for all of PIT 
presentations. 

You don't have to be a theatre major to 
sew costumes, build scenery or do 
anything else connected with a 
production. 

Obviously, this is not a well-published 
fact. Out of seven people (non-theatre 
majors) contacted, not one knew that 
they're welcome to audition or crew a 
PIT production. 

Is this problem a result of an apathetic 
student body? Because IPFW is a 
commuter campus? It certainly can't be 
the fault of the folks at PIT! Audition 
notices go up on bulletin boards, 
stairwells, this newspaper and even 
bathroom walls. 

Nowhere has there been language 
indicated that non-theatre majors need 
not apply. Joel Murray, also an 
instructor and PIT director and 
performer has been overheard as saying 
that he's tried everything "short of 
handcuffing students and dragging them 
into the theatre" to get more students 
involved in PIT. 

Our theatre is unique in that we get the 
best of students and community work. 
This leads to a well-rounded experience 
— one in which everyone involved 
benefits. Don't let your college years slip 
by without taking advantage of this 
unique learning experience. 



Catch the next wave 
to the Sunshine State! 



.^The surf is in for many pale-skinned 
IPFW students who plan to catch the 
next wave down to the Sunshine State 
As the buses pull out Saturday, many 
of us will be shedding the wool sweaters, 
gloves, mittens and parkas for more 
alluring clothes — specifically those 
skimpy bathing suits.. 

•:*:-However, before you leave, we would 
;lfilie to offer you sun-worshippers some 
:^elpful advice for your trek South. 

&gt;-:-Foremost, don't let alcohol be the 
&gt;focus of your vacation. Last year, 
:]tragedy struck in Florida as two 
-Students fell to their deaths off hotel 
^balconies. Two others were murdered 
; rtiitchhiking to Florida. Those were 
/-unnecessary deaths, and alcohol 
ipiobably contributed to at least two of 
|:tbem. Don't let alcohol be the be-all and 
:'ihe end-ail of a successful spring break. 

;-:-Another hint for trekkers to Florida: 
: : Take advantage of the activities set up 
'iQ'r you. Get involved in the contests and 
: games. Bring some happy memories 
;home with you. 
/: : And for those who are driving 



yourselves down South, take a breather 
at the "pit stops" the Indiana and 
Georgia State tourism departments and 
Budweiser are sponsoring. Located at 
highway rest areas in Henryville, 
Indiana (I-95S), and Valdosta, Georgia 
(I-75S), and Savannah, Georgia (I-85S), 
each pit stop .will provide hot coffee, 
doughnuts aud-other refreshments, as 
well as highway safety tips and tourist 
information. 

Spring break is just that — a break 
from studies. So this next suggestion 
should not be too hard to follow: Forget 
about school. (Unless of'course you have 
an exam the following Monday.) Take 
time off to just relax You have several 
weeks yet to tax your brain with theories 
and formulas. Lay them aside for a few 
days. Spring break is living, not 
cracking the books! 

Most importantly, remember our 
first suggestion: Do not let the success of 
your vacation ride on how much you 
drink and how many nights you were — 
pardon the expression — "blitzed ."

-Letters to the Editor 



Richards unfair 

To the Editor: 

I am writing in response (o 
the letter to the editor 
written by Kathleen 
Richards in your Feb. 27 
issue. The letter was cer- 
tainly packed with opinion 
and inflammatory language, 
but really missed out on the 
significance of the subject 
the grim reaper represented 
— Biblical prophecy and 
man's destiny 1 happened to 
attend the presentation, 
which unhappily, Kathleen 
did not, and found it factual 
and informative rather than 
"ignorant and superslitius" 
as she claimed. 

In fact, Biblical prophecy 
is one of the most solid 
arguments demonstrating 
the veracity of the Bible. To 
date, 80 percent of the 
Bible's prophecies have been 



fulfilled to the letter. The 
remaining 20 percent are yet 
to be fulfilled with the end 
times, This tells me that this 
last 20 percent should be 
taken seriously, which was 
the purpose for the 
presentation "Mankind 'on 
the Brink." 

I regret more people did 
not attend and have their 
eyes opened (o the prophecy 
currently being fulfilled in 
our generation, because 
these prophecies affect 
every human being, in- 
cluding the students at 
IPFW. "Blessed is he who 
reads and those who hear the 
words of the prophecy, and 
heed the things which are 
written in it; for the time is 
near" (Revelation 1:3).

More on PIT 

To the Editor: 

I suppose that just about 
everyone here at IPF- 
W— students, faculty and 
staff — knows about the 
tradition of excellence 
maintained by the PIT 
theatre here. Because this 
campus is a commuter 
campus, involvement of the 
community in IPFW 
programs is vital. It is 
especially vital to the PIT 
program, which presents 
-students, alumni and staff 
the opportunity to continue 
the worthy cause of en- 
semble theatre &lt; where there 
is only a team, no stars), 
while offering the com- 
munity plays whose scope is 
broader than plays high 
schools might do i offering 
only entertainment) or plays 
that are typical fare at 
dinner theatres and Civic 
(plays (hat will generate 
income i, with exceptions, of 

Thus, PIT represents an 
important sector of Fort 
Wayne's theatre economy, 
which has a tradition going 
back perhaps a hundred 
years. PIT is vital in two 
respects: it trains actors and 
it offers the community 
serious theatre. It is true 
that other groups in town do 
serious pieces, but not as 



frequently as PIT It is also 
true that there is a place in 
the world for light-hearted 
theater too; and Uiis largely 
is taken care of by other 
theater companies. 

As a cast member of 
"Luther," I would like to 
emphasize the importance 
for student actors to work 
with members of the com- 
munity at large, and for all 
actors in a production to be 
challenged. Acting is built up 
like any other skill. If you 
play tennis, for example, you 
only get better by playing 
frequently wilh someone 
who is better at it than you, 
or who is at least at your own 
level. 



There is currently in the 
Communications and 

Theatre Department a move 
toward the requirement that 
all speaking roles be 
students. This would have 
the effect of negating 
everything that is special 
about PIT. Instead of a vital 
theatre department, we 
would have at IPFW a 
program much like (hat our 
student actors left in high 
school. I would urge con- 
cerned IPFW community 
members to comment on this 
situation.

Educational requirements should be updated 



By MICHELE SHAFFER 
Managing Editor 

A small number of people 
gathered Monday with the 
Educational Policy Com- 
mittee (EPC) to discuss the 
current educational 
requirements and propose 
changes that will alter the 
school's program. 

Commentary 

Presently, this school is 
following an antiquated set 
of requirements that dale to 
around 1976. Yes, these are 
the same requirements that 
are shaping the core of 
education for students in 
that school 

It is amazing when one 
considers what has hap- 
pened in the past 10 years: 
Advanced medical 

breakthroughs, new political 
relations between the U.S. 
and the Soviet Union, 
scientific break-throughs in 
the space shuttle program, 
and the new advancements 
in the Cold War America 
and the Soviet Union are 



running a race to see who 
can build the most 
sophisticated defense 

syslem. 

This is all part of our dally 
lives and it is also very much 
a part of the requirements of 
the School of Science and 
Humanities. It is the role of 
the administration of the 
school to ensure that 
graduates of their program 
will be able to, make critical 
judgements about relevant 
topics of the day and in- 
tegrate these with other 
areas. They should beableto 
see how science relates to 
math, which relates to 
economics, which can relate 
to politics, which in turn 
affects whether they have 
missiles buried in their 
backyard or whether their 
children will someday live in 
a space station. 

The conecpt of what 
makes a well-rounded in- 
dividual changes as society 
develops. Therefore, it only 
makes sense that the 
school's basic educational 
requirements be improved 



to allow the students the 
opportunity to leave IPFW 
with the most liberal arts 
and sciences program that 
they could have. 

James Bundschuh, dean of 
the School of Science and 
Humanities, said it best 
when he said, "The best 
charge is to live well into the 
21st century," 

Another area of concern 
that was voiced at this 
poorly -at tended open forum 
was that of the level of 
academic competency 
students leave the school of 
Science and Humanities with 
at the end of four years. 
There was a suggestion of an 
exit examination or a senior 
thesis in a student's major. 
There are big problems with 
these suggestions. 

First of all, the goals 
stated in the handbook, are 
so vague, that there is really 
no present basis on which to 
grade a thesis paper or an 
exitexam. We are never 
really told what we should be 
able to come out with at the 
end of four years, except a 



"broad, general education." 
How specific will your test 
items be if you initiate an 
exit exam for all students? 

The idea is good, to a point. 
What will happen if a student 
with an above-average 
accumulative grade point 
averages reaches the point 
of submitting a senior thesis, 
and receives a "C." What 
will you do? Tell that student 
they lost the ball 
somewhere, and they have to 
go back and do more work? 
This is most detrimental, 
considering the student 
might have a job lined up, or 
they might be planning on 
attending graduate school in 
the fall It seems that four 
years of good, hard work and 
well-earned, above-average 
grades are more an In- 
dicator of a student's 
academic competence than 
one test of thesis. So, for this 
problem, you will have to 
investigate further for a 
solution 

Probably the best solution 
to strive throughout a 



About the beltway syndrome... 



By MARK RUSSELL 

Today's lesson concerns 
the Beltway Syndrome 
named after the highway 
circling Washington. "Inside 
the Beltway" is Ihe school of 
thought which says that 
during the Super Bowl game 
people in Indiana were 
arguing about two guvs 
named Gramm and Rud- 
man. 

"Inside the Beltway" is 
the parochial assumption 
that most divorces in 
California are caused 
because the parties couldn't 
agree on whether George 



The "ITB" theory en- 
visions a young woman in 
Nebraska nuzzling up to her 
boyfriend's ear and 
whispering — "Darling, did 
you hear what Ed Meese 
said on 'Face the Nation' 
yesterday?" 

It is the alarm contained in 
the statement, "Wait till the 
people in Peoria hear about 
Angola!" 

It is the feeling that all 
over the country people are 
staying awake nights, ridden 



with guilt because they 
never wrote to "Rosty." 

It is me — sitting Inside the 
Washington Beltway 
trusting the reader to un- 
derstand that last item! 

Watt's nature 

James Watt is back in the 
news as chairman of a 
company which aids en- 
vironmentalists in detecting 
pollution Other than Ralph 
Nader joining a Marine 
commando unit, I can't think 
of a bigger irony. 

Walt's company, which 



has the liberal white wine- 
and-brie-sounding name of 
Environmental Diagnostics, 
makes anti-pollution 
equipment. The same man, 
mind you, who once looked 
at a field of tulips and had a 
vision of a tarpit. 

The same James Watt who 
keeps Bambi In his living 
room — mounted over the 
fireplace. 

Careful, this could be a 
trick — unless Watt hand- 
cuffs himself to the gate of a 
nuclear power plant.

ByKELLI 

KIRKPATRICK 

Staff Writer 

Comics? Community 

workers? Disc Jockeys? 

You tell me. 

The dark haired, olive- 
skinned, blue jeans and 
leather jacket-clad Charly 
Butcher directs two 
reporters to a small, neatlv 



furnished conference room 
in the west end of the WMEE 

radio station. Grabbing a 
nearby chair. Butcher im- 
mediately plops down, rolls 
his legs over the chair's arm 
and quietly wails for his 
partner, Tony Richards, to 
arrive. 

Richards walks in. That's 
when the fun begins. The 
blonde, blue jeans and tennis 
shoes and WMEE jacketed 
man offers the still-standing 
reporters places to sit. He 
playfully reprimands 
Butcher, and the two mor- 
ning show hosts, "those two 
guys in the morning," begin 
an hour long exchange of 
jabs, jokes, sarcasm and 
glares — much like their on- 
air bickering. 

It is contagious. The 
foursome are soon engulfed 
in ridiculous anecdotes and 
absurd stories: "What do we 
do in our spare time?" 
mocks Butcher, 29. "We put 
cats in our microwave." 
Unfortunately, Richards, 25, 
elaborates and the in- 



terviewers decide to move 
on. 

■'Who is your main 
competition?" someone 
asks. 

"We are our biggest 
competition," says Butcher, 
as he cites the latest radio 
ratings as proof. According 
to the Spring 1984 Arbitron 
ratings, and WMEE's 
Listener Profile Report, the 
97 FM station attracts more 
listeners between the ages of 
12 and 54 than any other local 
station. It also reveals the 
highest percentage of 
contemporary radio 
listeners are high school 
graduates, employed, 
married, Caucasian and 
living in a household of 
three. 

Among WMEE listeners 
between ages 18 and 24, over 
19 percent are men and 20 
percent are women; 37 
percent of listeners have 
attended college while 34 
percent are graduates, the 
report states 

Although they are aware 



of the ratings. Butcher and 
Richards agree it is not the 
most interesting part of the 
job. They like being disc 
jockeys. 

"I've always been in- 
volved in radio," explains 
Richards. 

"Yeah. Paychecks weren't 
steady doing stand-up 
comedy," adds Butcher. 

Richards, a Fort Wayne 
native, is married. He and 
his wife, Sarah, 26. have a 
two-year-old daughter, 



Ste&lt; 



Nix. He began 



spinning discs 
nouncing tunes at age 13 with 
his brother Jack in their 
WOIV garage station. He 
worked for various Hoosier 
stations before joining 
WMEE six years ago. Along 
with his regular morning 
show routine, Richards is 
also the station's program 
director. 

Butcher, an Akron, Ohio, 
native, started out in radio at 
age 15 in a small Nobtesville 
station. He has taken radio 
jobs in Greenfield, Lebanon, 



Plainfield. Terre Haute, 
Muncie, Lafayette, 
Indianapolis and Dayton, 
Ohio He landed the job at 
WMEE two years ago and 
has been sticking his foot in 
his mouth ever since. 

Richards is also active in 
sports, particularly baseball 
and golf. Butcher loves to 
read, listen to classical 
music and study the stock 
market. 

Butcher also admits his 
hard-driving, aggressive 
nature has influenced staff 
changes at the station. 
Richards, a devoul family 
man, confesses he is more 
easy going, but Just as in- 
fluential. Together, the jocks 
are active in local fund- 
Last fall, Richards 
engaged in a grueling, one- 
man human wave for an 
organization called SCAN — 
Suspected Child Abuse and 
Neglect. The two have raised 
thousands of dollars for 
community organizations 
and charities and were in- 




Charlle Butcher 

volved in the "toys for tots" 
Chrislmas program. 

Unfortunately, this article 
must end because Richards 
is running off to present a 
check from another fund- 
raiser and Butcher must 
return to the radio world.

Marchers begin 
cross-country trek 
for world peace 



ByEARLSMITH 
Chief Reporter 

The Great Peace March 
began last Saturday at the 
Los Angeles City Hall — an 
idealistic effort to inspire the 
world to make nuclear 
disarmament a reality. 

"If we can accomplish this 
seemingly impossible task .. 
then the citizens of this 
country will understand once 
and for all that they can 
undertake another 

seemingly impossible task: 
the task of abolishing 
nuclear weapons for good," 
said David Mixner, 
executive director of PRO- 
Peaee (People Reaching Out 
for Peace). 

Mixner, a successful 
public affairs planner and 
fundraiser, came up with the 
idea after his seven-year -old 
niece told him she thought 



she was going to die in a 
nuclear war. This moved 
him to form a non-profit 
corporation to organize the 
logistics for a cross-country 
march. 

Over 1000 people of all 
ages met at Los Angeles City 
Hall before starting the trek. 
Among the well-wishers at 
the send-off were Mayor 
Tom Bradley, actor Martin 
Sheen, and singer Melissa 
Manchester. 

A goal of the march is to 
have 5000 people cross 15 
states during the next nine 
months, arriving in 
Washington, DC, during 
November. 

Tentative plans call for the 
marchers to arrive in 
Chicago on Aug. 14, South 
Bend on Aug 22, and Angola 



Aug, 



27, 



aid Roger 



Voker, Indiana PRO-Peace 
coordinator. Rallies are 
planned for Chicago and 
Notre Dame. 

Arrangements have been 
made to provide college 
credit for students interested 
in marching. There will be 
ongoing seminars, 

discussions, and detailed 
study sessions on topics such 
as nuclear weapons and U.S. 
foreign policy, Iheory and 
politics of non-violence, and 
the nuclear arms race, said 
Marshall Mayer of PRO- 
Peace. 

Students also have the 
option of walking part of the 
distance, said Jose Vasquez 
of the Chicago PRO-Peace 
office. If a person has two 
weeks or more to donate he 
or she may spend it "making 
history." 

After leaving Los Angeles, 



the marchers will follow 
interstate highway 15 to Las 
Vegas. They will cross the 
Mojave Desert and the 
Rocky Mountains, arriving 
in Denver on May 21, sai " 
press release. Then the 
march will cross the states 
of Nebraska, Iowa, : 
Illinois. 

"There will be a com 
and rally in Chicago on Aug. 
14," said Jose Vasquez 
From Chicago, the marchers 
will travle through northern 
Indiana on U.S. 20, through 
northern Ohio, arriving ir 
Pittsburgh on Sept. 24 and ir 
New York City on Oct. 25. 
Then the marchers will turn 
south, arriving 
Washington, D.C. on Nov. 15.

Workshop proves operas aren't all stuffy! ^^ 



By MICHELLE M. 
BANDOR 
Staff Writer 

Anyone who thinks opera 
is Tor stuffy intellectuals 
should think again. Last 
weekend, IPFW's Opera 
Workshop proved opera 
offers a little something for 
everyone. 

Last Saturday and Sun- 
day, the Opera workshop, 
under the direction of 
associate professor of music, 
Joseph K. Meyers, presented 
highlights from Wolfgang 
Amadeus Mozart's The 
Magic Flute, and from 
Gallantry, a one-act comic 
opera by American com- 
poser Douglas Moore. 

The Magic Flute is con- 
sidered Mozart's most 
lyrical operatic work. It is a 



romantic piece dealing with 
the conflict between good 
and evil. 

Presented in concert 
version. the IPFW 
University Community 
Orchestra, conducted by 
John Loessi, accompanied 
the selections from The 
Magic Flute while Meyers 
narrated. 

Guest artist, Mary 
Wynston, performed the role 
of the Queen of the Night. 
Wynston, a coloratura 
soprano, holds a master's 
degree in music from 
Indiana University at 
Bloomington. Joseph and 
Violette Meyers coached her 
last summer while teaching 
at the Summer Academy in 
Siena, Italy, 

Wynston has a strong, 



beautitul voice and 
demonstrated a broad vocal 
range. Of Wynston, Violette 
Meyers said, "She gave our 
students a shot in the arm. It 
was new and exciting for 
them and she gave them a 
taste of what 

professionalism is all 
about." 

Normally The Magic Flute 
is performed as a large scale 
production with elaborate 
sets. Joseph Meyers had 
explained it was important 
for the audience to use its 
imagination while listening 
to the selections. 

This task was made that 
much easier by the en- 
thusiasm exhibited by the 
student performers in their 
performances. 

Gallantry is a comic opera 



spoofing television soap 
operas. 

There are three main 
characters in his hilarious 
opera ; Joseph Welches plays 
Dr Gregg, a surgeon in love 
with a nurse played by 
Cathie Kreigh. Com- 
plications arise when this 
nurse learns that Dr. Gregg 
is married and Dr. Gregg 
learns his beloved nurse is 
actually engaged to surgery 
patient Don Hopewell, 
played by William Reinking. 

Another amusing 

character in this opera is the 
sexy female announcer who 
gets earned away with ad- 
vertising Billy Boy soap. A 
funny scene is when the soap 



opera cameraman gets 
carried away with her and 
zeros in on her every move. 

The authentic operating- 
room equipment and 
medical uniforms were 
provided by Parkview 
Memorial Hospital. Kathy 
Shanklin provided the piano 
accompaniment 

In one evening, the Opera 
workshop provided a 
sampling from the 
smorgasbord of operatic 
offerings. It is exciting to 
know that these offerings are 
right here on campus. To a 
one-timeopera ignoramus, it 
proved that opera is 
anything BUT stuffy.

The Philharmonic has a 
full weekend in store for all 
of those not boarding a bus to 
Florida this weekend. 

Those of us who stay 
behind, for what ever sordid 
reasons, will be entertained 
with selections from the 
Renaissance era by a group 
called Caliope and a recital 
through the combined efforts 
of the Fort Wayne Youth 
Symphony and the All-City 
Choir. 

Caliope, a four member 
renaissance band will ap- 
pear with the Philharmonic 
Saturday. 8 p.m. at the 
Embassy. 

The program will feature 
the world premier Scenes 



from Breughel for 
Renaissance Ensemble and 
Orchestra. This piece was 
written by Peter Schickele, 
of PDQ Bach fame — the 
wild man who insists on 
making his presence known 
when he "plays the 
Embassy" by climbing a 
knotted rope from the 
balcony and bounding on 
stage 

Scenes for Breughel is a 
six movement work, each 
having been inspired by a 
painting from the Flemish 
artist, Pieter Breughel, 
who's "slice-of-life" pain- 
tings may be seen at the 
Toledo Museum of Art, 

Schickele combines the 
use of 20th century textures 
with the Renaissance in- 



struments and laces the ' 
content of the piece withhis ', 
own offbeat style. ■!■&gt; ! 

To celebrate "Music in flit: 
Schools Month." the Yo'dtjiV 
Symphony and the All-City. '■ 
Chorus will perform Sunday ! 
at 7:30 p.m. in the Elmhurst !

White standout at IPFW 



By JENNY BLAKLEY 
Troy White has come a 
Jong way since he firsl began 
playing volleyball, just two 
and a half years ago Last 
season, he was voted Mid- 
.wesl Freshman of the Year, 
and was a first-team Mid- 
west Intercollegiate 
Volleyball Association 
(MIVA) selection 

Among the honors he has 
.received, he was also a 
member of the North team, 
: which competed in the 
National Sports Festival. He 
'.was chosen in 1983, and 
traveled to Colorado 
Springs, Colorado, to 



compete in the Festival. Two 

years later, he once again 
journeyed with the North 
team to the National Sports 
Festival, held in Balon 
Rouge, Louisiana. 

IPFW was the site for the 
'83 Festival try outs, and 
Mastodon coach Arnie Ball 
was the head coach for the 
North squad. Ball saw great 
potential in White, and 
recruited him for the up- 
coming year. "I was just 
getting inlo volleyball then," 
White says. 

White thoroughly enjoyed 
the two weeks of volleyball 
and thought it was a good

opportunity to compete. "It 
was a great experience. I 
met a lot of people while I 
was there," White com- 
ments. 

White, a sophomore 
majoring in public affairs 
with political science 
background, didn't play for 
his high school vclleyball 
team in Columbus, Indiana. 
"I became involved lin 
volleyball i through my 
parents, and the parks and 
recreation department," 
White comments. "I used to 
think it was a 'sissy' sport!" 

White's future aspirations 
include a spot on the 
volleyball team to compete 
in the World University 
Games, as well as a possible 
selection for the coveted 
Olympic team. "You might 
as well think bigt" White 
interjects. 

Presently, however, White 
is thinking about his con- 
tributions to the Mastodons. 
"I just want to play and 
become the best that I can," 
he replied. 

IPFW is having another 
successful season, while 
competing against various 
top teams, including Ohio 
State and Ball State. "We 
are just as good, if not 
better, than the other teams 
(on our schedule)," says 
White. 

Although IPFW lost a 
heartbreaking match to the 
Cardinals, the Mastodons' 
victories in the first two 
games were very im- 
pressive. "1 guess that Ball

Lewis wins GLVS

Staff Writer 

Schann Leathers of the 
IPFW men's basketball 
team scored 10 points in a 
losing cause as Lewis 
University defeated IPFW 
69-52. 

Lewis dominated 

throughout the contest and 
demonstrated why they are 
again the Great Lakes 
Valley Conference's 
champions. 

The Mastodons kept 



Troy White men's volleyball playei 
athletic department i. 



said the first two games we 
won were the best games 
he'd seen, including games 

against UCLA and USC," 
White adds. 

The season is still in full 
swing, and over spring break 
the Mastodons will travel to 
California to face additional 
difficult opponents. Santa 
Barbara will be the toughest 
team remaining on the 
IPFW's schedule, according 
to While. "Our trip to 
California will hopefully 
fine-tune our skills for the 
IVA tourney," White says. 
"We're really excited about 



going (to California). 

The future success of the 
team depends on various 
factors. "We have to 'push 
over the top' to win." White 
comments. "But a lot of guys 
have the heart and spirit, 
which is needed to pull us 
through." 

The final test for the 
Mastodons will be the NCAA 
tournament. The top four 
teams fvrom each division in 
the NCAA, including the 
MIVA, will travel to Penn 
Stale in May, for the 
championship. "That is what 
we're shooting for," White 
concludes.

Lead the Adventure 



themselves in the game 
through the half with good 
defense, but trailed 28- 
20. In the second half Lewis 
milscored IPFW 41-32 and on 
more than one occasion led 
by 20 points 

At St. Joseph's college, the 
Mastodons again lost, this 
time 63-61, but this time it 
was a familiar season-old 
tale: they had a lead, a 
substantial lead, and 
couldn't hold it. 



The Masiodons led at 
halflime, 39-25, and even 
held a 57-49 lead with 4:30 
left in the game before the 
roof caved in as St. Joseph's 
full court press caused 
several turnovers and the 
IPFW offense could only 
muster four points down the 
stretch, 

Jim Morlan scored a game 
high 19 points and Bruce 
Erwin pulled in eight 
rebounds for IPFW 



Lydy grabs record 



ByTONVDUNAWAV 
Staff Writer 

Women's basketball coach 
Julie Calahan used the word 
hysterical several times 
when describing the Lady 
Don's 89-77 loss to Lewis on 
Feb. 27. 

"It's hysterical anytime 
you allow the last place team 
to score 89 points," Coach 
Calahan said, "and it doesn't 
say much for our defense 
either." 

The Lady Dons trailed 40- 
39 at the half, but several 
turnovers in the second half, 
23 overall, proved to be the 



telling difference. 
Freshman standout Terri 



"Our girls played 

well at St. Joe but we 

just came up short. " 

Coach Julie Calahan 

Syndy scored 26 points and 
sophomore Lori Miller 
contributed another 21. Lydy 
led all rebounders with 14. 

At St. Joseph's, the Lady 
Dons fell 72-S9 and 



again it was Terri Lydy 
leading the way with 26 
points and a new IPFW and 
GLVC women's basketball 
record of 22 rebounds. 

Coach Calahan said, "Our 
girls played well at St. Joe 
but we just came up short. 
The big difference was that 
we were able to break their 
press the first half but it 
gave us a lot of problems the 
second half " 

Lydy finished the season 
with 171 rebounds in GLVC 
play for a new conference 
record.
