Prop 8: Deciding tlie Fate of Potential Marriages opEd 



By Peter Schnellenberger 



A Utile over oni- year ago. ihe siate of California cnacied tc^slation that 
(lertartd, "only marriage bclwt'en a man and a woman is valid or recognized in 
fJaJIfrjrnla." Thit law l» known as the Proposition 8, aka rhe Prop 8. It is now bving 
contended at a Federal (Jiun. with a trial date of lanuary 1 1, according to a press 
rtlpaw from Ihe American Koiindaiion for Kqiial Rights. 

Although the court's decision will only peHain to Ollfomia. ii can have lasting 
ramiricalions on Ihc rest of the nation. This could be a good or bad thing for ihr 
li.m community nf Indiana and Ihat of IPI'W in panicular. 

If upheld, il will send a message to the rest of the nation disapproving of samt- 
sex marriage and dlwriminating against gays and lesbians, but If turned down ii 
will be a triumph and more states might be willing to legalize same-sex marriage, 

leannlc Dir.lemenle, Associate Professor of Psychology at IPFW and U;BT 
rights advocate said that Prop B" wrote discrimination into the state constitution " 
She said that il violates the separation of church and state by 'inject |ing| religious 
beliefs Into Ihe law of the land," due in part because of the heavy involvcmeni 
of the Church of Jesus Christ and Laller day Saints - or Mormon Church ■ in thu 
campaign for Prop 8. According to ihe church's website, *A broad-based coalition 



of churches and other organizatlom placed the amendment on the ballot. Ti\t 
Church will partidpaie with this coalition in seeking its pouage.* 

The final decision over f^p 8 is only a month away and with tl comes the fate 
of thousand.^ of potential marriages within California and possibly thosr of other 
states around the nation.

The Fight to Eliminate Prop 8 



By Melissa R. Hirsch 

tusNntOI Viludtnn Ipha nki 

The fight to overturn last year's 
decision to keepCalifoniia's Proposition 
8 [ referred to as t^p 8) that reads 'Only 
marriage heluven a man and a woman 
is i-alkl or recognized in California' 
is far from over, lust last week The 
Associated Press reported lhat the 
Federal Appeals Court is considering 
requiring some documents from an 
internal campaign lhat was part of a 
luwiult against I^op B. These internal 
campaign records may assist in the 
fight to overturn California's decision. 
Although advocates of Prop 8 know 
they losl a major battle in 2008 when 
California decided not to change their 
law; supporters of Prop 8 say the war 
has just begun. Some campaigners are 
still arguing for their rights; stating lhat 
by not allowing marriage between any 
two people (not just allowing domestic 
partnerships to same-sex couples) 
is essentially a violation of the equal 
protection and due process clauses 
of the 14"' Amendment to the U.S. 



Constitution. Califomians are working 
diligently to obtain 700,1)00 mote 
signatures in order to add a repeal 
request to Prop 8 on the hnllot for 2010. 
You can visit wwwsignforequalitycom 
for moa* information: but you must be 
a California resident to sign your name 
to (he petition. According to this sKc. 
"To repeal Proposition 8 and restore the 
right to marry for same-sex couples, 
we need to pass a new inlllative In 
the November 2010 election. But first 
we need to qualify the initiative for 
the ballot.' St-veml iiaie*. Including 
Connecticut. Iowa, MoMachusetls, 
New Hampshire, and Vermont, arc 
allowing same-sex marriages to date. 
Other states acknowledge same-sex 
marriages but refuse to Isjue same- 
sex marriage licenses. Indiana passed 
a Defense of Marriage Act In 1997. No 
funber action has been taken despite 
efforts of the Indiana Senate to obtain 
a constitutional ban on gay marriage. 
According to a press release from the 
American Foundation for Equal Rights, 
Prop 8 will be contended at the federal 
level on lanuary 1 1. 2010.

Smoke Hut Diaries 



By Robin Crowell 



As ihc »cm«i« draws to a 
( lute, rhcunforttinalc real Izalion 
comi's to fruilfon that the line up 
of the smoke hui next semesier 
will chanRp. No longer will we 
be graced with the presence of 
the Mme faces day after day, 
week after week. No longer will 
the same debauch topics climax 
In Ihc same fashion that ihcy 
do (well, al least not for the hr^t 
week or (wu of the upcoming 
semester). And, worst of all. the 
clement of the place changes 
BO drastically that It Is almost 
awkward for the first few weeks 
uf a new semester. 

As [ have said bcfare. the 
l1UI.^ on campus arc places 
where people find iheir release 
Ihroiighout the mnnotony diat 
lends lo plugue students during 
l)ie throws of the semester. If it 
w;1^ not for the people In regular 
.iiirndnnce. ihougli, then the 



hutv would be nothing more 
than places where people went 
to smoke. 

Over this semester I 
reall7^-d that the smoke huts were 
so much more than just place\ to 
smoke. I have realized that they 
are little communities of people, 
all with at least one common 
bond, that come together once 
or several limes a day to. facet 
by facet. reveaJ themselves on 
a level that complete strangers 
simply do not do. 

I have always said that I hated 
people, Thislsatrueslatement. I 
hate everything about the idea of 
people. I hate Ihc ways it) which 
people conduct ihem.selves and I 
hate the outright scummy things 
that people tend to do. But. 
what i^ mLsunderstood by this 
statement is that the concept 
of (he individual differs greatly 
from tlie concept of people. Thi.s 
semester I was graced with the 
opportunity to meet individuals, 
to get know these unique entities 
on a level that simple passers 



by could not understand I 
obtained a support system that 
1 did not think existed outside 
of the comfort of family. They 
are even more than a support 
system. Ihcy arr now my friends 

Even if some of these faces 
never make their way into 
my life again. I have realized 
something very important by 
their presence over (he past few 
months: everybody meets for a 
reason. You have all helped me 
through a tumultuous course in 
my collegiate career, all the while 
providing me with a reason to 
want to come lo school each and 
every day. 

With that, I leave you all with 
this from The Lawrence Arms, 
Fireflies: 

"A monument to monumental 
dying thoui^ts/ [«l ihe currents 
lake us whea- they will. From 
this (hut) I can sec the world 
unfold before me. I'm brooding 
over broken nights/ 1 break each 
sentence like a limb. This is my 
exit.' 



Letter to the Editor 

Response to Urbana Article for Issue 12 



To the IPFW Student Body: 

The student senate has passed a funding request 
fur a select group of students to attend the Urbana 
09 missions conference. This decision will set a 
precedent of endorsing specific religious activities 
on a Slate funded university, which is nut only 3 
misappropriation of funds, but also repugnant to the 
flrst-amendmeni of the United Slates Constitution. 

The original request, passed on November 2. 
2009, provides indications of bias that appears lo 
endorse a faith. Tlie a-quesi immediately assens 
that "generations^nf college students have come to 
Urbana to hear about 
cutting edge 

in missions 




panicipate in God's global mission." It continues lo 
detail what will occur during the five day program: 
"in-depth Bible study and prayer.' The schedule 
also includes a scripture study every day, along with 
prayer and prayer ministry. If this is not an indication 
of a Christian bias then it is difficult to imagine a level 
that would merit a bias. 

Student Body I*resident Amanda McCann vetoed 
the bill. 

In response. Ihe Global Christian Fellowship 
(GCF) resubmitted the travel fund request. In 
the second submission there were many glaring 
omissions and assertions that were blatandy fal.se. 
The quote beginning with Generations of college 
students and God's global mission was absent. The 
second funding request also responds to the first veio 
with "Some important points to consider about this 
event: This event is not a missions trip; It is not meant 
for only Christians (...|; If IPSGA funds this trip, it will 
not be pouring its money into propagating' a certain 
religion". GCP also proclaims that it is the universiii 's 
obligation to help students who wish lo pursue 
missionary work as a career. The original sr hpdiilp 
is included with no alieratfons. The fact remains that 
this is the e.Yact same evenL 

McCann vetoed the request a second time. 
She agrees that this is not a missions trip, but the 
knowledge obtained will be used for nussion trips in 
the future. Secondly, she asserts that upon visiting 
the Urbana website il is easily seen that "ever^- 
Urbana (conferencel draws people from all over 
North America who want to leam more about global 
realities, current missions issues, and their place in 
God's mission. . We welcome all who have a bean

As good as this album is, it is nothing compared to their live

of Indiana's indie albums of the year and is also a very

of mv favorite records, period. This album Ls the first release 
for tne northern Indiana based and was put out by Sergenl 
House records, which backs indie powerhouses such as This 
Town Needs Guns. Maps&amp;Ailases and Tera Melos. Front to back 
this record will catch you off guard, whether it is with a catchy 
breakdown, an unanticipated slow section or driving rode wjtn 
searing screams from vocalist Bobby Markos. 

*It was kind of like wriiinga book." said Markos when talking 
about howi- the album was put together. "We did not write any

District 9: Best Movie of the Year 




By Craig UoyiJ 



One would 

think that another film involving 
aliens would just get repetitive and 
overdone, similar to what World War II 
and zombies did to video games, but 
District 9 proved thai another alien in- 
vasion him is quite acceptable. 

An alien spacecraft has suddenly 
halted over the city of lohannes- 
burg, South Africa and the aliens on 
board are forced to settle in the city 
in their own habitat known as District 
9. TXventy years later, the settlement 
has turned into a complete slum and 
citizens of Johannesburg have had 
enough. The government decides to 
relocate the aliens to a camp further 
away from human civilization by hir- 
ing a militanl corporation known as 



Mulii-Naiional United (more com- 
monly referred to as MNU). 

The film follows a man by the name 
ofWikus Van de Merwe who is the lead 
officer during the eviction process. 
The movie uses a great deal of docu- 
mentary-like camerawork in the first 
half of the film that is very similar lo 
style used in the hit TV show. The Of- 
fice. The very beginning shows several 
witnesses being interviewed, which 
gives you a liltle bit of background on 
the whole situation to help you bcticr 
understand the storyline. The camera 
follows Van de Merwe out in the field 
during the eviction process and fre- 
qucnily refers to the camera by talking 
to il and cracking jokes occasionally. 
Though, as the film progresses, you 
see less of Ihe documentary style and 
more ofthc dramatic and suspensefu! 
side of the movie that we are all used 
to seeing in action films. 



Van de Merwe develops greolly In 

the movie, and while he is fonrcd into 
llfe-or-deaih siiuaiJons. he goes from 
being a soft-spoken, nervous Individ- 
ual to a courageous risk-taker. 

Though It looked preillctable from 
the beginning. 1 was happy to find out 
thai "District 9" progressed In a way 
that made me wonder what was going 
to happen next. It was quite suspense- 
ful and definitely had lis' fair share of 
twists and turns at ihe end. 

While the main storyline was well 
lold, there were still some things that 
were left unlold. The aliens, which ob- 
viously played a major role in the film, 
were still a mystery. I was left won- 
dering why their spacecraft suddenly 
stopped, what language they were 
speaking (no subtitles, by the way), 
who tht7 really were and where ihey 
came from. However, I do know what 
their favorite food Is cat food.

STUDENT ISSUti 



Dr Paladino Helps Protect Pandas 



By Jonathan Danielson 



The recent trip to China by 
chnncellorWand and co. ho.^ 
isniv:ti mr in ask a few qucr*- 
llons. What do we have (hat 
ihcy do not? The amwcr: Dr. 
Paladino. 

Dr, Paladino wore a dcnlm 
ithin and ba.wball cap. }le ap- 
peared to be very comforlable 
behind bi.1 desk, mulit-ia.«ldn(; 
a* we convened. One of the 
(irsi qucillons I asked wa* 
why he had gone on the trip 
10 China. The answer was ihal 
Dr. Paladtno has been working 
on Iracklng crealiircs for over 
.10 year^ now, und has rerined 
bnih the process and the me- 
ebonies ijrcally. 

Dr. Paladino may be belter 
known for his turtle tracking, 
lie has developed a utclllle 
broadcast unit thai remains 
deacllvalcd while the lurtk' is 
Kiibmert(ed. Tlila unit Is abuiii 
lhesl7.eora llashliglil. andha.i 
two eleclrudi's on its ends. An 
air lilled bliiddcr makes one 
end o( the iransmiiicr buoy- 
ant, the end with the anten- 
na. One at the conlacis is on 
(he antenna, tlie other on the 
power supply on (he base. 
Willie the turtle Is submerged, 
itu' lUtrenl K iin-lnliTnjpk-d. 
WhwMheiurile Mirfaccs, tho- 
aiilenna bifals tlie surface 
or Ibv waiLT iiiid (hus, ba-aks 
ilic nirrfni I uril Iroin (he 



off-*wtcch, (he iran.smitrer 
fimgs signals skyward, until 
(he turtle submerge* again 
Thev signals are cauj^t by 
salellKe. and forwarded in Dr. 
Paladino's terminal. E^ch sig- 
nal Is iriangulated, and plotted 
on a map for location. Thus, a 
map of where a tunic has been 
Is created, and can be used (o 
judge what areas should be 
protected. 

Bring in the pandas. 'We 
know practically nothing 
about pandas, where they 
are. how social lhe&gt;' can be 
in the wild, even the territory 
size." Dr. Paladino said. This 
is a problem for conservation- 
ists. In order to help protect a 
species, they must have some 
data known. In a country with 
a population count of one bil- 
lion people, there is a lot of 
poaching. I.awbreakers are not 



going to tell the gowmmem 
where (he&gt;' get their prey: how 
then do conservatiunbts get 
Ibis data? 

"The iransminers are being 
adapted for pandas.* Dr. Pala- 
dino stated confidently. 'We 
are going to use collars, like 
on some dogs and attach the 
transmitters to those collars* 

I was a litde skeptical. Pan- 
das are cuddly, furry creatures 
that occasionally break into 
kung-fu movies. If anything, 
would (hey be weighed down 
by the transmitter? My little 
view was Imploded by Dr 
Paladino's next statement of, 
'Panda's are a litde bigger than 
our brown bear. They are pret- 
ty big.' 

With this system, pandas 
will become less mysterious, 
and more knowledgeable. But 
this tracking doesn't end with 



just a little data on pandas in 
the wild. Some of (he top sci- 
entists in the Chinese univer- 
sities are coming here to IPFW 
to help set up the system. 
Some o( our scientisis will 
go (o China and work a( (hrir 
universities. In fact, a Chinese 
s(udeni is coming (his wrek to 
work with fJr. Paladino. When 
he goes back, he will have the 
knowledge of how to use this 
technology, and implemen( K. 
Back here in the USA, Dr. Pala- 
dino will receive data as well as 
help the s(uden( through the 
process. 

This exchange will not re- 
main only for the professors 



and foreign studrniv howrsTT. 
Any IPRV s(uden(s interested 
m going to ('hina (nt gniduate 
wtirk. or as a simple etthonge 
program, will be able to do sa 

'1 think the Chancellor Is 
srry farsighled to extend this 
opponunity to both our and 
ciiinese students,' said Or. 
Paladina 'Of course,' he add- 
ed thoughtfully, 'this depends 
on our students. If they do not 
sign up. the program for send- 
ing them would fold.' 

I hope this is nut (he case. 
Using technology such as this, 
and learning about an inctvd- 
ibiy shy species b not an op- 
ponunity to miss. 



"In order to help protect a species, 

[conservationists] must have some data 

known."
