Three members of the 
200-1-2005 men's basketball 
team have decided to leave the 
university before next season.

freshman Peter Campbell and 
freshman walk-on Andrew

IPFW to pursue other educa- 
tional ami basketball opportu- 
nities. 

Each of the three have 
obtained official releases from 
the university and are the first 
players to leave after the hiring 
of Dane Fife as the head coach. 
Campbell noted that his deci- 
sion had nothing to do with 
fife's hiring, while Bauer \

Key changes in the

Daniels' plan int ludis reducing the backlog of cases at state 
police labs by using stale colleges. Previously, the state had used 
federal employees and out -ol -stale interns to work at the labs. 

There is currently a backlog of more than 7,500 to 8,500 cases, 
according to estimates made by the Daniels administration. 

Indiana State Police lasi year busted the fourth -largest num- 
ber of meth labs in America, according to national statistics from 
the FDA. This could signal a promising trend, but the FDA also 
indicated this might be a symbol of the meth problem in the Mid- 

"There is no way to overstate the damage this drug is doing," 
Daniels said. And as far as I am concerned, there is no way to over- 
react. There is no step too strong to take in combating it." 

Daniels also \ diced si rung support for an anti-meth bill that 
would put most cold mud it i nes, which contain cphedrine, behind 



the counter at pharmacies and grocery stores. Ephedrine is a pri- 
mary ingredient in the production of methamphetamine. 

According to lane lankowski, Daniels' media director, the 
stale will begin a pilot program with several colleges and universi- 
ties designed to ease a backlog of drug cases at state police labora- 
tories in Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, Lowell and Evansville. Students 
will serve as interns at the labs and handle basic drug cases so that 
drug enforcement police can focus on other cases. 

Indiana University- Purdue University at Indianapolis will be 
leading the new crime-lab partnership, said lankowski. Six other 
schools, including Ball State and Indiana State will also partner 

Along with the announcement of the meth program, Daniels 
said the state will be building a new 70,000 square-foot police lab 
in Indianapolis to focus on drug cases. The lab will by coordinated

Legalization of cannabis beneficial to government society 



"A Prohibition law strikes a blow at the very principles upon which o 
government was founded." 

—Abraham Lincoln, 18 



"For nothing is more destructive of respect for the government and 
the law of the land than passing laws which cannot be enforced. " 

—Albert Einstein, 1921 



April 20 is here, so we fell thai an opinions page .it 
a student newspaper wouldn't be complete unless we 
approach the topic id i he legalization of marijuana. 

The subjei livity ot what this government consid- 
ers to beharmliil is extraordinary indeed Alcohol, a de- 
pressant that slows one's reaction time, is legal (though 
controlled). Sugar, which speeds then slows a body's 
metabolism, is legal and not controlled. Caffeine, an- 
other substance that artificially speeds metabolism, 
is legal, lligh-i liolcsicrol foods that clog arteries and 
cause heart attacks are legal. Iobacco has been scien- 
lilically linked to cancer, but it remains legal. Yet mari- 

The benefits of a pro-cannabis society are obvi- 



ous not only for the citizens, but for the government 
as an entity as well. Not only would the government 
have something more to tax, such as with alcohol and 
tobacco, but a government -regulated marijuana indus- 
try could ensure a standardized, higher-quality form of 
cannabis. 

It all comes down, in the end, to a matter of civil 
liberties. McDonald's has not gone on the black market 
because making n illegal would be a clear violation of 
citizens' rights. Alter all, the government does not have 
the right to dictate what foods someone eats. Vet mil- 
lions of Americans die each year from cholesterol-in- 
duced heart attacks. 

The plant has a medically-proven benefit for al- 



leviating die pain of glaucoma and chemotherapy as 
well. California is already working on legalizing mari- 
juana for medicinal use. 

If legalized, marijuana-related theft would be re- 
duced, freeing up an already overworked police force 
for more serious crimes. According to rite Washington, 
DC-based Marijuana Policy Project (www.mpp.org), 
over seven million arrests have been made in the U.b. 
since 1993, including a record 755, 186 in 2003. It is esti- 
mated that taxpayers spend about S 1 2 billion annually. 

How much money would we save if this number 
could be eliminated almost entirely'' Is the incarcera- 
tion worth the cost? What other crime problems could 
we be focusing upon?

Arab regime reminiscent of Nazis 



Nazism was (minded to create a society 
based completely on raci.il and biological purity 
It looks tor the dominance and superiority of the 
Aryan national uiuinumnv within political, eco- 
nomical, rat i.i! and t iiltm.il spcxrum in Europe, 
Nazism started to achieve its prospective goals 
by eradicating the people who belong lo foreign 
races in Europe such as Jewish, which known 
by anti-Semitism It is believed that Jewish peo- 
ple would thwart the creation of its upcom- 
ing ii.KiiMi.il mmmumlY that they weie looking 
(or. However, the lewish people, disheartened 
Aryan people and other people in the world 
revohed against Na/.ism {.nnscquentlv. Nazism 
was defeated by l l )-|S. liy the tune Nazism was 
dismantled in I urope as a terrorist organization, 
a new Nazism was bom. 

This new Nazism was founded by Arab 
countries It has similar goals to the former one. 
"I his formed Arab Nazi organization was named 
the Arab league. 1 he Arab League was estab- 
lished in order to create a society in the Arab 
world based entirely on Arab people. It seeks 10 
eradicate those who do not fit to the Arabization 
template in the Arab countries h looks for the 
dominance and superiority of Arab people with- 
in political, economical, racial, and cultural spec- 
trumsintheArab world. I he league membership 
constituted ol independent Arab countries in the 
globe The \r,ih league- chartei Article I stales 
that "Any independent Arab state has the right 
to become a member of the I eague." Ironically, 
all these Nazi Arab members were considered 
Islamic countries. I heir wlues and motivations 
descended from their Islamic curriculums and 
the holy Quran book. 

Arab Connl ties claim dial I hey are people ol 
paradise and goodwill and are chosen by God to 
guide non-believers I heir education and media 
have massive Islamic doctrines, which prevent 
racism and ask lor the cqualitv ol human beings 
In spite ol this, ihe \t.ih I eague practices a seri- 
ous son of the racism, abuse of minorities' rights, 
and monopolizes the power of the Arabian coun- 
tries. The Arab league's i barter Article VI II points 
out thai "each state shall pledge to abstain from 
any action calculated to change established sys- 
tems of any Arabian government." 

Moreover, the Arab league emboldens the 
eradication of non-Arab people by using forcible 



means. For example u supported the govern- 
ment of Sudan, which was esiahlishcd inainlv 
from Arab personnel, to practice brutal and 
inhumane means lo exterminate the Sudanese 
African people. The Sudanese African people 
revolted in order to demand (heir basic rights 
such as justice, equality and public service. The 
Arab I eague opposed and prevented the inter- 
national community from ratifying any actions 
against the Sudanese government. 

Additionally, it never dares to denounce 
the Sudanese government's genocide of its 
African descendants' population in any one 
of 1 1 it- league's summits. Rather, it rewards the 
Sudanese government by selecting Khartoum 
as a capital ot Arab culture This is an attempt to 
boost the morality of the Sudanese government 
to pursue its immoral policies against non-Arab 
people in Sudan. The Arab League charter disal- 
lowed any other non-Arab to gain the political, 
el onomii.il. racial and cultural influences in any 
of Arab states. As a result, il evades transforma- 
tion of the Sudanese's government regime to a 

Due to the existence ol the Arab league and 
its affiliated organizaiions. such as l.mjaweed, 
d Africa experienced 



in one of the Arab 
to come up with serious strategies that assist 
the Arabian regimes to suppress their ongoing 
riots. Although these riots are in the Arab coun- 
tries, they took place due to ihe injustice, abuse 
and luarginalizaiiuii of die monitory people in 
the Arab world therefore, for the international 
communities such as the United Nations, the 
United Slates ol America, and Luropean coun- 
tries must compel the Arab countries to disband 
their league, respect humanity, abolish discrimi- 
nation and promote democracy. In case the Arab 
countries do not respond to the international 
community's demand, the international com- 
munity most be reailv to lake immediate action 
against this Arab I eague terrorist organization. 



Honeymoons and Red Tape 



Staff Column 



Red Tape! We all know what it is, and have 
probably had an experience dealing with some 
typeol bureaucracy. 1 have had my fair share, but 
was very surprised 10 encounter u right here on 
campus, as close as KettlerHall. 

It all began in December when I married 
my fiance of 10 years. It was a joyous time and 
it stills Feels like we are on our Jioneymoon. 
Since December ihe minor annoyances associ- 
ated with a marital name change have been 
minimal. I changed my name properly with 
II'IAV by taking a copy ot my marriage certificate 
to the registrar's office. 1 bey have since made the 
requisite changes in my file. 

The problem started when the financial aid 
department also needed a copy of the license to 
dispatch in Wells Largo (or m\ loan approval Silk 
me, 1 was naive and thought that instead of get- 
ting my marriage cerulii ate oui of the frame and 
bringing it in 'wherever that Irame is— it is prob- 
ahl\ packed inside a ho\, only lo be rediscovered 
alter we move into our new home! maybe I could 
just gel a copy ot the copy from the registrar and 
give it to financial aid for processing. 1 inquired 
about my master plan in the registrar's office 
first, since I would have to obtain the copy from 
them. 1 was told that the policy is generally not to 
give out those pieces oi in Ion nation in the file, as 
they are property of IPFW. 

Well, I understand that, but had it not been 
for me bringing in the license, it would not be the 
properly of IPFW. Can I please get a copy? Well, 
call back on Monday, thev said, because ihe lad\ 
in charge of that was not in. OK, so I dropped 
in last luesduy and asked the front desk atten- 
dant in the regisirar's office. She was extremely 
friendly (I must say. the registrar has some of the 
most helplul. kind and nice workers of any place 
on campus.) 

The attend. mi tried to help me, and was lold 
by someone in her office that financial aid i ould 
retrieve the copy of the copy from my file in the 
file room I as\ ,- gh. I walled right backdown 



lo financial aid and lold the 

the registrar's office had jusi said to me, not two 
minutes before. She looked perky and said, let 
me tell so-and-so. She returned a moment later 
and told me that imam ial aid cannot retrieve the 
copy of the copy from my file in the file room. I 
would have to bring it in myself. 

Stupid me, 1 asked her if I had to have 
the original itself She, to my surprise, said no. 
If I could obtain the copy of the copy thai the 
registrar possessed, then 1 could turn that in to 

Here is where i he situation gels bureaucrat- 
ic. If I do not have to have the original marriage 
i.ertificate (hen why couldn't financial aid just 
retrieve the piece ol paper from my tile? Is it that 
hard? Is it that far of a walk? I mean. I can get the 



file from ihe File n 
me where it is. 

Was I stupit 
the marriage cer 



would just tell 



to assume that one copy of 
ificate could take care of all 
of the business at IPFW regarding my name 
change? The license I turned into the registrar's 
office was for the sole purpose ol validating in;. 
name change for the school and all of its intents 
purposes. Isn't the prmuremeni of financial 



kinds a school purpose? Is it really t&gt; 






ask for the financial aid administratot 

over and Find my name alphabetically and pluck 

a paper oui of a file, make a copy and fax it? 

I understand (hat the financial aid depart- 
ment has many sludents to aitend to, but the 
files are located in the registrar's office, right 
down the hall. I hat doesn't even speak to the fact 
that the registrar could have gotten the paper for 
me as well, but chose not to. The red tape was 
getting stickier and higher by the minute. And 1 
guess I am stuck looking for that dam marriage 
certificate when I get home. Beware to all stu- 
dent ncwlyweds, dispatch a copy of that license 
lo every departmeni on campus lo be sure your 
holy nupiials do not screw up your semester like 
they did mine.

Independent (i.e. artistic, foreign, crazy, radical) films are finding more of a footing in 
Fort Wayne. Here's a rundown of the newest indie films being shown in town... 

Downfall— If you thought Adolph Hitler was a bad guy, you were right, but this film (the first German made 
movie about the Nazis and their infamous leader) offers insight into the last days of Hitler and his reign, which 
no History Channel presentation can match. Bruno Ganz, the actor portraying Hitter, is mesmerizing, fierce, and 
brutally sad. The film avoids many of the WWII cliches, spending its time and development and offering engag- 
ing insight to a time and place we can only read about (in things like movie reviews, see below) 

The Chorus- a French film concerning "a maverick teacher who finds himself in the process of taming a 
school full of savages." The raucous energy of the students and their humble professor's efforts to tame 
these shrews may seem like a story we've all heard before, but this film happens to let us on the other side 
of the Atlantic know we aren't much different from our European friends. 

Bride and Prejudice- a reworking of Jane Austin's "Pride and Prejudice," this film breaks into spon- 
taneous song and dips the celluloid into amazing Technicolor explosions. If you favor the likes of Gene 
Kelly and Fred Astaire and can accept an unusual blending of American and Indian culture, this tale may 
prove an Interesting to your cinema palette.

Simon played for the Portsmouth Sports Club during 
the tournament. His team included Chuck Hayes (Kentucky), 
Quemont Greer (DePaul) and Tyrone Salluy (West Virginia). 

In the first game of the Portsmouth Sports Club, the team 
defeated Beach Barton Ford 86-81 on Thursday. April 7. PSC 
was led by 19 points from Greer and 16 points from Andre 
Owens of Houston. 

Simon played only 21 minutes, but shot 4-for-5 from 
the field and l-for-4 from the free throw line for nine points. 
Simon also had six re-hounds, second to Hayes' 10. 

The next day, PSC played again defeating Norfolk Naval

Simon also noted that it was important that stouts got 
another chance to see him since he did not play in the NCAA 
Tournament. 

The Portsmouth Invitational is the only post-season

Downfall of the empire 



In All Directions 

By Dan Vance 



I have spent upwards ol ihree years cover-

( oaeh Amu: H. ill's team had I lie buckeyes on the 
ropes, one point away hum a i-0 victory. 

But then Ohio Stale came hack to pick up a 
3-2 win. How? How is that possible? 

I mean, Ohio State is the 1 1th best team in 
the entire country. I will give that to them. And 
no, the Bin keyes dul ma play up to their poten- 
tial for two anil a hall games. Hm the sad fact is 
thai our leant just couldn't put them away. 

IPFW couldn't get the job done. 

And who do you blame in that scenario? It's 
hard to realh pass mil blame with something like 
that. It was just a total learn meltdown that was 
hard i tt watch Furthermore, it was quite unchar- 
acteristic of the men's volleyball team.

physically, mentally and emotionally. 

Even the captain, senior Man /bysmvski 
seemed to break down, receiving a yellow I sanc- 
tion) card after a uilgar eschangc with the offi- 
cial. To see a player 1 hold in such high regard

So why didn't it work? Why did Saturday

Last year, Jasick served as a graduate assis-

in more than 20 years. 

After meeting Fife at this year's Final Four in 
St. Louis, Missouri, Jasick became a nominee for 
the position and was brought to campus to meet 
with various administration officials. 

"There is no question visiting with Mark 



Pope, the chancellor .uu\ Dane -just the vision 
and the enthusiasm they have for IPFW and the 
men's basketball program," noted Jasick. "It is 
extremely exiting to be part of." 

With the Blue Haulers, Jasick came to Fort 
Wayne when his team played IPFW in January. 
Middle Tennessee State won 66-61 in that con- 

Jasick noted that because of that visit, he 
bte to become slightly familiar with the 
[Unity, facility and teams. 
"I know Coach Fife has been working, bad 
and instilling his philosophy over the last few 
weeks. Recruiting is obviously paramount in 
bringing in quality people who can help on the 

Fife noted that Jasick "is going to a valu- 
able asset to the program." Before he began 
his coaching career, Jasick played at Muskegon 
Community College, where he was once named 
All- Conference honorable mention. He gradu- 
ated from Mars Hill College in 20U0 with a bach- 
elor's in biology. 

Jasick also was an assistant at Lincoln 
Memorial under recently named associate head 
coach leffTungate 

"He is a loyal person, a hard worker and a 
person who is willing to work morning, noon and 
night," saidTungate. 

The new coach began working with the 
team, as well as Fife and lungate on "lUesday, 
April 19.

Hormann served at WISE for 21 years, most 
of it as sports director. He has been in the news 
broadcasting profession for 27 years. 

While his on-air skills are admirable. Pope 
said, Hormann's impressive credentials as a

"I didn't quite sleep as well when those

and am kind of biased to Fort Wayne athletics." 

As a lifelong resident, Hormann believes he 
has established relationships in fort Wayne that 
can parlay into support for IPFW. He called the 
school an "unpolished gem" that the area com- 
munity should support. 

"If they only knew all of the good things
