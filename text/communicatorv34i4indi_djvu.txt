'Christi' criminals set to plea

Members of an Indiana militia 
group planned to protest what they 
considered a morally-objectionable 
play to cover up their own morally 
questionable act — murder-for-hire.

dents faced a myriad of drug and

Now, Fred "Capt. Col. K.C, 
Hawk" Keuthan, 64, and Michael 
Smoot, 39, are set to plead guilty to 



lessor charges in an agreement 
with Owen Circuit Court in 
Spencer. 

Keuthan and his small band of 
militia allegedly planned to hire a 
contract killer to murder a fellow 
militia member, whom they 
believed was an informant. 

The killing was slated to take 
place in August, 2001, during a 
performance of "Corpus Christi." 
The militia members were going to 
use their protest as an alibi, but 
their plan went awry in more than

Back to space, Runway 33 

Plans have been announced the space shuttle will relaunch in the spring, 2004. Wlule thorough 
investigation* arc nece^sart/ when tragedies happen, we eventually need to tnj again. 

The space shuttle Columbia was due to land at Runway 33. It was scheduled to land at Runway 
33 like it has countless times before. Runway 33 could be seen as its destiny -- and fate interrupted. 

Every day, we wake up and go through our days. Every night, we have a Runway 33, be that 
Runway 33 a spouse, or a friend, or something immaterial ? like the desire to move. To establish a 
new Runway 33. 

Runway 33 is a home. An anchor. 

And yet, eventually, all of us don't get there. We'll travel thousands of miles to touch Runway 
33 one more time, and something burns us up minutes from her, or him, or it. 

We are no longer anything but a mourned idea. 

That's the glorious thing about it, though. We're all in the same situation. Life is a challenge, 
and for us to go through our challenges, we need our Runway 33. That one thing that makes us feel 
like all the miles are worth it. And to not try through our lives to make it back again is to never get 
off the ground in the first place. 

To do that means you'll only ever know the land. And that's tragic when we alt have the ability 
to learn so much more. 

The lives of the seven astronauts are not worth more than the lives of seven anyone-else killed 
anyhow-clse. But those seven astronauts stood up to challenges, personal and otherwise, and said 
"I'll try." That's where the difference lies. An astronaut is not a better person than anyone else, but 
they have taken a dream and not just fantasized about it. 

To most, space exploration is a "collective" U.S. dream we share. We want to be in space — to 
explore. To learn. And when our collective dream turns to nightmarish, people react differently. 
Some look at it as a financial and human reality check, believing it '$ stupid to go to space because it 
wastes of money and lives. Most look at it from the standpoint of a challenge. 

We knciu this was eventually going to happen. To say it will never happen again would be 
naive. But to say we're not going to try would make us spineless. Regret and learn from the mis- 
takes. Honor and team from the astronauts. 

And don't be spineless in the eyes of our ancestors or our grandchildren. 

Columbia was the first shuttle - John Young and Robert Crippen took it up in '81. For over 20 
years, that shuttle brought dozens of astronauts back after carrying them to space. And they were 
all able to return to their Runway 33 of life. 

Editorial 

Devoted to others in life 

Had anyone suggested at the beginning of last week that Governor Frank O'Bannon would out- 
live actor John Ritter.few would have believed it. 

As it is, Rittcr passed torn/ of a rare heart condition before O 'Bannon succumbed to his stroke. 
And within this week, the nation also lost two music artists, Warren Zevon and Johnny Cash. 
In each of these people, toe lost more than their collective contributions of humor, insight and 

We lost people who gave back to us through their talents and devotions. They tried to make us 
think, feel or work for a better community. 

O'Bannon dedicated decades to Indiana. His dedication wasn't to a political party, but to a con- 
cept ofHoosiers as people. He was relaxed in discussion - like a grandfather. And he was wise in his 
advice as a grandfather as well. 

Ritter dedicated dozens of pratfalls to his vieioers and fans via his television shows, and spent time 
reworking his life so he wouldn't be knoion just as jack Tripper Cash and Zevon both used music 
and lyrics as artistry; Cash as a dark poet; Zevon as a quirky looker of life. 

They shared their lives with us. 

Mourning is for families and friends. For us, the deaths are a time to reflect on how much we 
give in proportion to how much we take.

Always growing 



By Debbie Dambra 
Managing Editor 

When I got out of high school, the three things I wanted to 
do were: travel, party and be in plays. I must admit that I have 
accomplished that now decades later, but the realization that life 

ore than a trip, consumption of alcohol with friends 
becoming "someone else" on stage to act out other characters 
lives has taken years to learn. 

When did I grow up? I believe it's happened in the last 
year of my life. Last October, I started my journey into moti 
tional books, tapes, CD's, VHS's and the like. I even ven 
tured into diverse subjects such as: the power of positive think- 
ing, Zen Buddism, self-actualization, aromatherapy, meditation, 
yoga, astrology, dynamics and Date Carnegie. I even re-read 
my bible. 

The readings themselves did not make me "grow up," but 
rather encouraged me to "break out of the box," to explore new 
ideas and be open for change in my life. Life is constant ch 
but it is not to be feared. Life is to be lived. Life is to be 
embraced. Life is to be experienced day by day. 

Life is full of wonder fid insights and many times take you 
■&gt;ff guard." A friend of mine whose husband died this yea\ 
told me, "you could not stop his death, but I often thought of you 
■our strength in adversity many times during his illness." 
Her remark was based on a year in my life when I was "truly 
tested" with my stepfather's death, my fiance's death, my moth- 
being placed in a nursing home and her rehabilitation. But I 
ver lost my hope or belief that life would be "good" again. 
I visited a co-worker's husband who was hospitalized and 
ventilator. My co-worker friend said the family was upset 
that they could not communicate with him because of the 
machine. I made him flashcards that said such things as: " 
hot," "I want to sit up," etc. so he could "speak" to them, 
took a goofy stuffed animal that played music to exercise and the 
animal moved as if exercising. Unfortunately, he was comatose 
by then but the family still played it in his room. When he died, 
the family took his items home including my stuffed animal. As 
they left his room they squeezed it and it started its upbeat 
cise routine and their tears became laughter. 

I believe we all grow up when we want to. Buying a first 
getting a first job, having a first child and living awayfr 
home for the first time may seem like the "quantum leap" into 
growing up, but that's not necessarily so. Generally speaking, 
1 believe adversity often plays a part in seasoning our grozoth 
through experience. The real maturity test is understanding the 
miracles tliat occur every day in your life . . . the good and the 
bad. 

Many people just exist, they don't live. Many people live 
the past and don't move forward. Many people run so hard 
in life that they can 't appreciate it with a calendar of daily activ- 
ities that offer no sustenance. Many people stay inside and hide 
from life. 

My challenge to you is not to "grow up" but rather to live 
life fully and enjoy your time at IPFW. In the words of 
Mandino, motivational speaker, "Live your life as if you'll be 
dead at midnight." By giving a daily "end" deadline, you 
appreciate things more, you are more compassionate with others 
and you live a fuller, enriched life. You will "grow up" when 
ant to, when life opens you up like a flower and you have 
the time to smell the fragrance. Enjoy the other "flowers " along 
your path and understand that they, too, are growing up with 
you.

Burmese dissident 



Burmese students on cam-

the IPFW community to sign a 

petition in an effort to shine a 
light on the circumstances of 
Aung San Suu Kyi. 

Aung San Suu Kyi has been 
jailed since May 30, 2003 by the 
country's government. 

IPFW student Kyaw T. Soe 
is asking concerned citi/en- to

Aung San Suu Kyi is a 
Nobel Peace Prize winner who 
has challenged the government 
in her home country before. 

"I always agree with (Aung 
San Suu Kyi's) non-violent \\'.i\s 
to achieve change," Soe told the 
Joumal-Ga2ette in a recent edi- 
tion after organizing a protest in 
Fort Wayne. 

The petition asks the 
United Nations to bring the situ- 
ation into the forefront, not just 
of her, but of the country. 



"The 



about her 



health and safety has grown 
because her well-being is 
unknown and doubted," the 
petition says. 

It asks for her to be released 
immediately; for an official 
report to be presented to the 
United Nations Security 
Council; and for the UN to urge 
continued diplomatic pressure 
on the current government until 
the "regime nuke-, fundamental

Bickis was welcomed into the neiv stu-

The buildings have been constructed at 
a rapid rate, although earlier this year, 
IPFW Chancellor Michael Wartell said 
they wouldn't be completed until the sum- 
mer of 2004. 

After that, students will start moving 
into the townhouse style living quarters. 

Already, a manager has been hired to

surplus to his initiatives and says 
he is keeping the city "fiscally 



"I understand that a positive 
future for Fort Wayne depends on 
investing in our people, our infra-

environment in which opportunity 
can grow for all of our citizens,'' he

CareerFest, Job 
Fair on Sept. 18 



Fair this week. 

Flow do college •-Indents begin 
their careers? Many students hike 
that first step by attending job fairs 
right on their campus. IPFW's 
office of Academic Counseling and 
Career Services (ACCS) is sponsor- 
ing its first CareerFest and job fair 
on Thursday, Sept. 18, from 10 a.m. 
to 3 p.m. in the Walb Student 
Union Ballroom. 

Cathy McGinnis, ACCS employ- 
ment services coordinator, says so 
far 20 local and area employers 
have committed to taking part in 



the fair. The office has held similar 
events in the past during the 
spring semester, but McGinnis says 
they decided to move it to the fall 
because "employers say they do a 
lot of recruiting in the fall. For 
example, most accounting firms 
recruit this time of year." 

The event, which is free to job 
seekers, is designed for IPFW stu- 
dents, alumni, and the public. 
McGinnis says this is a great 
opportunity for employers to meet 
qualified candidates for full or 
part-time degreed positions or 
internships, adding there is still 
time for companies to register.

First Person 



My car, her name is Carly 



By Katie Pruitt 

The Communicator 

I am not the sort of person 
who likes cars or really knows any- 
thing about them. I like my car and 
I know how I feel about it. ■ 

Carly was my first car and is, 
to date, the only one I've ever 
owned. She was my dad's car, and 
when he decided to hand her over 
to me, I had to learn how to drive a 
manual transmission. 

It was Spring Break 2000, just 
a couple of months before high 
school graduation. I was 18 and 
full of confidence. The stick shift 
took care of that. Over the course 
of that one week, my self-assurance 
slowly dissipated until i was bare- 
ly a shell of my cocky self. 

There is a certain rhythm 
involved with driving a stick, and I 
am basically rhythm-less. Why 
can't 1 just take my foot off the 
clutch and then hit the gas? Why 
do they have to happen simultane- 

Gradually, ! developed a feel 
for the car and my clutch-gas tran- 
sitions became smoother. But in 
the mean time, I became very 
familiar with stalling. 

When you stall a manual 
transmission (I've never stalled an 
automatic), the car doesn't neces- 
sarily stop moving. With my criti- 
cal father, whom I desperately 
wanted to impress, sitting next to 
me, I panicked frequently. Not a 
day went by that didn't end with 
my screaming "I give up!" Carly 
made me earn the right to drive 
her. When you work that hard for 
something, it means more. 

I didn't name her until I knew 
I could keep her. By the time I had 
mastered driving that car, I knew 
there was no other car in the world 
for me. I call her Carly for two 
equally silly reasons. 

First, I thought it was an 
amusing play on words that could 
hide my real reason for naming her 
Carly. There is a character on a 
soap opera that 1 watch named 
Carly. She is feisty and tempera- 
mental and reminds me of my car; 
she's loyal without being terribly 
dependable. It took me awhile to 
appreciate her, too, but once she 
wormed her way into my heart, 
she was there to stay. 

Whenever something breaks 
or quits working and she has to go 
to the mechanic, I get an anxious 
feeling deep in my gut. I know that 
one of these times, she's not com- 
ing home. I'm afraid to answer the 
phone. Denial is comfortable; real- 

I try to make the most of what 
time I do have with Carly, but I 
honestly can't imagine my life 
without her Getting to know and 
understand Carly hasn't been easy, 
and I don't know if I could ever get 
as close to another car. 

With a stick shift, the driver 
feels more in control because more 
action is required of him or her. I 
suppose people who drive auto-

opy editor for The Communicator 



braking. I like control Carly gives 
me that, or she lets me think I'm in 
control, at least. 

Carly has flaws. I'm not blind 
to them, and I used to find her infe- 



she takes me to and from the places 
1 go but she is herself a place I go. I 
love driving in the rain. I am pro- 
tected from the elements, but at the 
same time, I am right in them. I 
can feel the impact of the raindrops 



Carly is somewhat of an 
inspiration to me ... I've 
yet to encounter a day 
when she refused to start. 



They distin- 
guish her from 
all the other 
gray Honda 
Civics in the world. It's actually 
difficult for me to recall all the 
things wrong with Carly because I 
am so used to them and they don't 
really bother me. It's as if I had to 
list all the things about my best 
friend I'd change if I could — what's 
the point? She is who she is. 

I talk to Carly more than I talk 
to most people I know. When I 
greet her every morning, I say, 
"Good morning, Carly. Ready to 
go?" And she never is. She usual- 
ly needs a couple minutes to warm 
up so I start her and then go back 
inside. After a particularly tough 
day at work or school, I am very 
glad to see Carly. I get in, sigh, and 
moan, "What a day." Then she 
takes me home, where I leave her 
in her spot next to the garage. 

Carly is somewhat of an inspi- 
ration to me. I don't know many 
people tougher than my car. 
Seventeen is pretty old for a car, 
and although she gets sick more 
often than she used to, she's still in 
pretty good shape. I've yet to 
encounter a day when she refused 
to start. Some days are easier than 
others, but she always starts even- 
tually. 

I think the people (and cars) 
who mean the most to us are the 
ones who teach us things about 
life. 

Carly has taught me the virtue 
of patience. I've spent many chilly 
nights in empty parking lots wait- 
ing for Carly to warm up. I used to 
try to leave right after I started the 
car, but by now, I know it's just not 
worth it. The engine needs time to 
warm up enough so that the gears 
will shift. I don't rush her any- 

The paradox of Carly is that 



the . 



bul 



I'm safe from 
them. Rain 

affects me like no 
other weather 
can. A slow driz- 
zle puts me in my 
favorite mood — 
pensive, observing, aware of 
everyone and everything that has 
nothing to do with me. 
Experiencing the rain from my car 
is the best way because I can sit in 
traffic and look out at the world 
through the windshield, and while 
I'm actually out in the world, it 
can't really touch me. It's not the 
same as watching the rain from my 
bedroom window. The house feels 
too excluded and distant. Standing 
in the rain destroys the experience 
because I am too distracted by the 
wetness to see the rain. Inside 
Orlv, the balance is right, and lean 
just watch the rain. 

Sometimes I strive to be invis- 
ible, and Carly helps me with that. 
She's a small, gray car, and there's 
nothing flashy about her. 

She blends well with traffic, 
and I start to get a feeling of 
anonymity, of being just one of 
many, as I drive down whatever 
street on the way to wherever I'm 
going. 

Driving gives me a sensation 
of society like nothing else I do. In 
traffic, 1 can gain some much-need- 
ed perspective. Inside one car in a 
long line, I realize that the world is 
much bigger than I am, and while I 
am indeed part of it, I'm just a 
small part. I watch all the other 
people inside their cars and won- 
der where they're going. They 
smoke, talk on the phone, put on 
makeup, or drum their fingers 
impatiently on the steering wheel 

. I'm in my car singing "You 
May Be Right," and I think I must 
be two-hundred times happier 
than these people who can't sit still 
,it .i stoplight. Too bad they don't 
have someone like Carly.

the jayson blair witch project 



by scott m. lawson 



As a journalist, I'd like to thank 
Jayson Blair. 

For so long, I fretted about 
things like "getting facts straight" 
and "getting quotes accurate." 
Heck, I've spent a lot of valuable 
time re-listening to interviews to 
ensure I didn't write "they're" 
when my source actually said "they 

And to think, this entire time it 
was completely ethical just to 
make it all up. 

Had I known it was permissible 
to fabricate, I would have won the 
Pulitzer by now. My stories would 
have been much more intriguing 
and insightful. 

Dateline: NASHVILLE -- Former 

Vice President Al Gore recalled the 
misunderstanding that took place 
while he was running for president 
in 20(10 about his "helping to invent 
the internet." He admitted he 
exaggerated his role. 

"I didn't have much to do with 
the invention, but I was one of the 
first two individuals to participate 
in what would become known as - 
- 'cybersex'," he said uncomfort- 
ably today. 

When pressed (ewwww) for 
details, Gore continued. 

"It's really kinda funny, really. 
Apparently, one of the real inven- 
tors of the Internet was in the room 
next to me. He's named Chuck - 
he's a real practical 
joker. He told me 
in the 'chat room'

college girl. He 

ture, and I'll tell 
you, I thought she 
was a hot. So I par- 
ticipated, because 
boy was I turned 
on," he said. 

After 15 minutes, Gore learned 
the truth when Chuck started 
knocking on the door. 

"Boy, was I embarrassed when 1 
found out. He'd sent me a picture 
of Drew Barrymore. I thought 1 
recognized her. I even told her so 
during the ... experience. Chuck, 
he sure thought it was a hoot," he 

Gore doesn't regret the situa- 

"I like to think I helped baptize 
America's newest favorite pas- 
time," he concluded. 

But, wait, I don't have to keep it 

to small-time personality features. 
I could "enhance" world events. 

Dateline: PARIS - France, in 
what it called an action of "pre- 
emptive surrender" turned over its 
government to the Indian Ocean 
island chain of The Seychelles 

"We have heard the people of 
The Seychelles have at least a few 
ships and aircraft, and we hope we 
will appease them in our actions," 
French President Jacques Chirac 
said. 

The government of The 
Seychelles, based in Mahe, was 
surprised by their quick and unan- 
ticipated pre-emptive victory.

guess it'll be nice to go there some-

drink of some kind of spicy alco- 
hol. 

Wow. I've got this career-path 
down pat. Everyone will want to 
hire me. Next year's contest is 
already over. I win 
the Pulitzer -- for 
either my Gore 
story, my article 
about Ship Lollipop

Dateline: HEAVEN 
-- God conceded 
Wednesday that He 
really did put the 
Boston Red Sox on his Shit List 
after they sold Babe Ruth to New 
York. 

"It wasn't so much a curse," The 
Almighty explained. "More like an 
arrangement I came to with some 
souls from the Boston area who 
were friends with The Babe." 

Yep. Just give me the Pulit/er 
and a seven-figure book deal. For 
journalists and writers, that is just 
more salt in the wound. Jayson 
Blair is now writing something, 
and some publishing house will 
buy it. 

One of the steps of success in 
writing is publishing a manuscript, 
any manuscript. It is tantamount 
to being on a professional athletic 
team that makes it to the playoffs 
(the champion wins the Pulitzer -- 
awkward to wear on your finger, 
but worthwhile). 

Every serious journalist loses 
because of Blair, and Blair wins 
again. Sure, his credibility is 
diminished, but not his bank 

I'd like to thank Jayson Blair. I 
look forward to buying his heart- 
felt book which I'm sure will be 
filled with fictionalized heartfelt 
feelings of his remorse. I'd be 
tempted to take his novel to one of 
his signing appearances. 

I'm curious if he could still 
autograph my copy of his book 
after I jam it straight up his ass. 

Al Gore knows a practical joker 
named Chuck who would think 
that was a hoot.

Masto' Mullet likes two SEC battles |gSS£r^ 




Two outta three ain't bad. 
Meatloaf, baby. Mullet rock all the 
way. The hat is off this week. The 
hair is flowing in the cool autumn 
football breeze and I'm 5-1. 

How about that N.C. State- 
Ohio State game? What a thriller! I 
told you Ohio State plays to the 
level of their opponents. N.C. State 
isn't a bad team, but it took OSU 
three overtimes to pull that one 
out. I bet if the Wolfpack's running 
back T.A. McClendon was healthy, 
we would all be singing a different 
song. He was six inches from win- 
ning the game! The Buckeyes can't 
keep this edge-of-the-seat game 
plan for much longer. Look for 
them to be defeated soon. 

Boilermaker Pete left a few 
nice messages on my answering 



machine about Purdue's lucky vic- 
tory over Wake Forest. C'mon, 1 
know ya'll saw it. Purdue CLEAR- 
LY jumped off side to stop Wake 
Forest on fourth down. The 
'Boilers got lucky, but are still a 
good team. They may be on the 
verge of a nice winning streak. 

And last, but certainly not 
least, how about those Irish? 
Heehee. Two words tell the entire 
story: pathetic, dominant. Go Blue! 

On to this weekend's games. 
There are big showdowns with 
early season conference implica- 
tions. Watch out for these match 

Michigan State at #23 Notre 
Dame. This is a non-conference 
game, but both teams have a sour 
taste in their mouth from last 
weekend. The Spartans were 
defeated on a last second touch- 
down and the Irish were 
STOMPED by the Wolverines of 
Michigan. Each has a quarterback 
controversy. MSU's Jeff Smoker 
was hurt in last weekend's game 
and may not be able to play. The 
Irish have the awful Carlysle 
Holiday or youngster Brady 
Quinn. So whom do you go with? 
The worthless senior or the raw 
and inexperienced true freshman? 
If Ty Willingham has any brains, he 



will bench Holliday permanently 
and let the frosh take the reigns. 
The Irish desperately need a spark, 
and the kid may provide it. I see an 
upset in South Bend if Smoker 
plays. 

Prediction: Michigan State. 

#2 Miami at Boston College. 
You have to be thinking, "Why is 
this a big game? Easy. This is 
Miami's first game of their Big East 
farewell tour. The Hurricanes' 
defection from the conference has a 
lot of Big East programs pissed off. 
Mighty Miami has a big target on 
their back and besides, BC always 
plays the Hurricanes tough. I don't 
see any crazy upset here, but watch 
for a fairly close game. 

Prediction: Miami. 

#12 Tennessee at #17 Florida. 
Look for a shootout in this SEC bat- 
tle. Both teams love to go vertical 
with the ball, but the Vols' may 
have an edge elsewhere. Tennessee 
has*^ more established running 
game than the Gators and I think 
that will give them the edge. The 
Vols' come out of The Swamp with 

Prediction: Tennessee. 

Masto's pick of the weekend: 
#7Georgia at #10 LSU. This is 
another SEC match up to watch. 
The Bulldogs and Tigers have been

hot and are playing with a lot of 
confidence. Each has a solid pass 
and catch combo: Georgia's David 
Greene to Fred Gibson and LSU's 
Matt Mauck to Michael Clayton. 
Both of these combos will put their 
respective teams on the scoreboard, 
but it all boils down to one thing: 
defense. The defenses have played 
solid thus far into the season, but 
have basically been untested; 
therefore, whoever has the best 
defense will win this game. 
Georgia lost a lot of defensive play- 
ers from last season and LSU may 
have a slight advantage. 

Prediction: LSU. 

This weekend's players to 
watch are Michigan running back 
Chris Perry; Miami (Ohio) quarter- 
back Ben Roethlisberger; and 
Colorado State quarterback 
Bradlee Van Pelt. Perry has estab- 
lished himself as the premiere back 
in college football and is the early 
season front-runner for the 
Heisman Trophy. 

Roethlisberger and Van Pelt 
square off this weekend it what 
looks to be a high scoring game 
between MAC and Mountain West 
squads. Both players are quietly 
establishing themselves as two of 
college football's best quarterbacks 
and long shot Heisman candidates.

tin' rebound, and Scott Olsen con- 
verted into an open net. 

Butler was called for 18 fouls 
as opposed to 12 for the 
Mastodons. The Bulldogs were 
also given four yellow cards in the

Coach Ball's overseas volleyball adventure 



By Nick West 
The Communicator 

Twenty-three years of experi- 
ence. Sixth on the all-time NCAA 
career victories list with 384. Five 
Midwest Intercollegiate Volleyball 
Association (MIVA) champi- 
onships in nine years, , Four NCAA 
Final Four appearances, Four time, 
check that, FIVE time Team USA 
men's volleyball coach. 
And that is just half of Arnie Ball's 

The IPFW men's volleyball head 
coach recently returned home from 
a nine week stint in Daegu, South 
Korea where he was head coach to 
the USA men's volleyball team in 
tin.' World University Games. 

The WUG rank second only to the 
Olympics, in terms of prestige and 
compelilion, but share the same rit- 
uals. There are opening and clos- 
ing ceremonies; teams are lavished 
with their country's apparel and 
flags as they march into competi- 
tion; and the fan base is vast. The 
biggest difference: the WUG are for 
the world's best student athletes, 
whereas the Olympics are for the 
world's best overall amateur ath- 

This was Ball's second go-around 
as the headman and fifth overall 
with the unit. He started as an 
assistant in 1985 under friend, Bill 
Neivlle; was named head coach in 
1989, assistant in 1991 and 1997, 
and again head coach this summer. 

"It's just an honor," he says. "It 
sends chills up and down your 
spine knowing that in this piece of 
the world, you are representing 
your country." 

Indeed it was an honor, as Ball 
coached his men through the hard- 




The U.S. Men's National Volleyball team poses after w 
ning the bronze medal in the World University Games. 



"We did a really good job in preparing 
some hopefully future Olympians.' 



"We got to 
expose these 
players «vhat 

competition, travel, food, housing, 
and language are all about," he 
said. "We did a really good job in 
preparing some hopefully future 
Olympians." 

A post 9/11 world, wars in Iraq 
and Afghanistan, the proximity of 
North Korea, and SARS outbreaks 
almost kept the team home. The 
head of security for the U.S. 
Olympic Committee gave Ball a 
Florida meeting in 
March about the SARS outbreak 
and tension between the Koreas. 

"We were more scared of SARS 
than guns," said Ball. 

A day before his team played 
short of winning the gold Nor(h Korea anti . governrnent 

Ra " did Iead the s 1 uad protests and violence covered the 
streets of Daegu. He recalls over 



"You are always a little disap- 
pointed when you don't win (the 
gold medal), and that's true of 
everybody," he says. 

But this was not just a regular 18- 
to 22-year-old college age tourna- 
ment. For many of the European 
and Asian learns, a student-athlete 
can be a 28-year-old grown man 
enrolled in three credit hours and | iei ' K | s ' 
be eligible to play. Ball's squad was 
the third youngest and will have 
four players eligible to play in the 
2005 Games. 

His youthful team may have fall 



IPFW men's volleyball coach Arnie Ball spoke recently 
about his adventures coaching the U.S. Men's Volleyball. 

5,000-armed police officers circling 
the arena and the team's bus before 
the match against North Korea the 
next day 

"I never was concerned about my 
well-being, but I was certainly 
aware that those people (North 
Koreans) were there," said Ball of 
his safety. 

Ball's involvement as head coach 
of Team USA helps ascertain IPFW 
as a contender in Division 1 athlet- 
ics and as university. Though most 
world volleyball coaches already 
know Ball by his past experiences 
and successes, he continues to for- 
mulate contacts. Case in point, he 
is always in contact with other 
world volleyball coaches and his 
name appears on every WUG 
media release and website across 
the globe. 

The IPFW volleyball recruiting 
process is greatly facilitated by 



Ball's WUG connection. Because 
he works with premier volleyball 
players of the world. Ball hopes to 
establish connections with their 
connections. For example, one of 
the players' friends may be teeter- 
ing between playing volleyball for 
IPFW or another school and would 
be influenced by the players' expe- 
rience with Ball. 

"Young players are pretty impres- 
sionable and want to come play for 
someone who has coached at the 
highest levels of the world," he 

Ball is not sure if he'll coach the 
team again. His loyalty to family, 
friends, and IPFW may outweigh 
the title of being the second most 
esteemed volleyball coach in the 
United States. 

"It depends on my wife," he 
jokes, "If she says 'yes' then I will 
probably coach again."

academic eligibility. L'laretl lied to authori- 
ties on the actual amount of money and 
belongings stolen from a vehicle he borrowed 
back in the spring; and reportedly took an oral 
exam in order to pass a class and remain aca- 
demically eligible before List year's National 
Championship game Is Maurice Clarett's 
punishment fair? And should he keep his 
football scholarship at Ohio State? 

Justin: The guy screwed up at THE 
Ohio State University, you can't much more 
high profile than thai He got mixed up in 
1 eBron and Co. and couldn't handle the hype. 
I le's got his nog, he's got his props, now kick 
him out of Buckeyeland. 

Nick: Nah, you can't do that. 

Clarett was wrong for what he did. And 
while l'msure these "several pages" of investi- 
gations are only the beginning for this kid, 
you can't kick him out tor U mg to cops. You 
can suspend him for his so-called "oral exam- 
ination, ' but not for lying to cops. 

Justin: Lying to cops is a crime!! 
Does Ohio State want to become Miami and- 
field ex-cons on their squad? 

Nick: It is a crime, but what Clarett 

needs is guidance. The punks at Miami in the 
late 80s and early 90s had no guidance. 
Clarett has arguably the best athletic director 
in college athletics, and the most professional 
and father-figure' like coach in college foot- 
ball in Jim Tressel. Let those two get a hold of 

Justin: I don't think Tressel wants 

anything more to do with Clarett. All of Ohio 
State wants this Clarett crap to go away. The 

Siickest way is to boot the joker out of the 
niversity. 

Nick: He does. He recommended 

that Clarett be released from his scholarship 
only if he wanted to. The other day at a press 
conference, Tressel seemed regretful that he 
didn't do more to guide Maurice. With his 
season long suspension, OSU will gradually 
forget. Time heals. 

Nick: Let me ax you something. If he is 
kicked out or leaves, where should he go? 
What should he do? 

Justin: Play for a D-l AA school. Less 
hype. Less pressure. Grambling, maybe 7 II not 
that, keep in shape, sit tight, and declare for 
the draft in two years. 



Nick: He shouldn't leave, but if he 

does, Grambling is a far better option than 
challenging the NFL early entry rule or going 
across the border to the CFL. 

Topic two: Everyone knows about the 
downfall of Baylor University A player was 
murdered by a fellow teammate; the coach 
tried to cover up the murder, his players' 
"extracurricular" activities, and academic 
fraud; the AD stepped down; most scholar- 
ship players left the learn; and now people are 
^ailing for the University's President's head. 
Can things get any worse for Baylor? 

Nick: The program can't get any lower. 
1 --~ Ul over from Valpar 






Scott Drew was brought over from Valparai 
to resurrect this dying program. He 
should be able to turn things around. Bayli 
also hired a new AD, Ian McCaw, who has a 
"fans and people first'' approach 

Justin: Just when you think things 
can't get any worse, they often do. The NCAA 
will throw down some mad restrictions on 
this program It will be years until Baylor will 
be able to call itself a contending team in col- 
lege basketball. 

Nick The team was never a con- 

tender in the first place! With teams like 
kansasand levas. H.iylor will ne\er be a con- 
tender in the Big 12!! Besides, the programhas 
already put itself on a two-year probation and 
withdrawn Irom the upcoming season's Big 
sy. NCAA probably won't put any- 

Lru They should and will. This 

team looks more like the squad on ESPN's 
Haymaker-- than anything else. Scandals, 
drugs, murders. The NCAA will come down- 
Nick: Maybe. Michigan put itself 
on probation for violating NCAA polices. 
Drugs, cheating, improper recruiting, gifts 
You name it, the Fab Five did it. 

Justin: True, but 1 can't remember 

someone losing his lite in retaliation for Chris 
Webber calling a timeout when he didn't have 



players to the NBA anytime soon, after every- 
thing is over. 1 could probably walk on to this 
team. 511", 155. .DING!!!! 

Nick: Sad thing is, you probably 

could. But the bottom line is, these kids will 
still suffer. Fifty years from now, they will all 
remember their experience at the Baylor bas- 
ketball program and put their heads down in 
shame and sorrow. None of this was their 
fault. Their coach lied to them. The program 
is lost and their basketball careers and lives 
have been affected forever. 

Justin: I agree with that assessment 

; before those kids
