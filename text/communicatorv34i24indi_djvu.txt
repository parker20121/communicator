Weissner commented the 
Omnibus Lecture Series has been 
going "great so far." There have 
more and more diverse people 
attending the series this year and 
officials ,ire pleased with the turn 






The i

coming, according to Weissner, is 
that each year, six people are invit-

Visitors from IPFW in Rome try to absorb the art and architecture of the Sistine Chapel. 

When in Rome... 



It's a" larger classroom with a 
bit of a commute, but well worth 
the effort, according to instructors 
and students who have attended. 

When Rome is a classroom, 
it's a classroom with a view. 

The course is INTR 220, 
Architecture and Urban Form. The 
coursework is traveling to and 
learning about such renowned 
locations as the Roman Colosseum, 
the Sistine Chapel and the remains 
of the buried ancient city. 

"This course is unlike any 
other course that a student would 
ever take because it is totally expe- 
riential learning," IPFW professor 
Matt Kubik explained. "There's no 
classroom time. The class is on the 
street at the site viewing the great 
works of art and architecture - 
talking about it at that place," he 



added. 

Kubik is leading the class for a 
14th year this summer between 
July 8 and 22. CELT instructor 
Samantha Birk will join him. Birk 
has extensive experience as an art 
history teacher. Kubik has been on 
every IPFW trip to the, city, and has 
also lived in Rome for a year. This 
will be Birk's tenth trip with the 
IPFW course. 

Officially, this class is part of 
the Interior Design program at 
IPFW - with the work towards a 
two-year Associate's Degree. But it 
also counts as general credits for 
anyone who wants a different type 
of class. Kubik developed the 
course and said it has been offered 
with a variety of inter-disciplmari- 
an instructors. 

"Everything from art histori- 
ans to liturgical experts to land- 
scape designers, interior designers 
and architects," he said. 



The cost, $2,655, includes trav- 
el, lounging, meals and entry to 
museums. The facility where they 
stay is run by Benedictine nuns of 
the Camalodese Convent on the 
Avenrine Hill. IPFW and Trinity 
College in New York are the only 
higher education entities that are 
allowed to stay at the site. 

"It's an extraordinary place to 
stay Kubik said. 

It is well worth the price, 
according to one IPFW student 
who went in 2002. 

"It was an amazing two 
weeks. There's nothing like it. 
Nothing like it at all. The greatest 
trip I've ever taken," junior Todd 
Adams said. "It's amazing. You see 
all this stuff on TV, and then you 
get there and you see it and it's like 
'Whoa.'" 

Adams is studying to become

Online sometimes: WebCT Vista 
upgraded but sometimes down 



1PFW upgraded to a new ver- 
sion of WebCT for the Spring 2004 
semester. This new system offers 
more Options, but some of the same 

Professor Duslon Moore, who 
teaches philosophy, said that it is 
much easier for professors and 
instructors to organize their classes 
because they can just create one 
template and associate it with more 



fda- 



WebCT Vista also helps stu- 
dents keep I heir classes in order. 

"It (WebCT) helps to keep you 
organized. It's kind of like an 
online assignment book," noted 
Lisa Schaeffer, an IPFW junior. 

This new version hasn't been 
flawless admits Scott Vitz, 
Coordinator of Academic 
Computing for IT Services. 
I lowever, he attributes most of the 
problems with Vista to users not 
knowing much about the program. 

"Some problems are a result of 
Vista malfunctioning, but a majori- 
ty are caused by other things on the 
user's computer, such as incorrect 
browser settings, lack of proper 
plug-ins, the presence of special 
search toolbars within browsers, 
and user unfamiliarity with Vista," 
■ oioinented VitZ. 



He went on to say that prob- 
lems of previous semesters cannot 
be compared because the circum- 
stances surrounding those prob- 
lems were different, "with the 
biggest being that this is a brand 
new implementation of a brand 
new product that is unfamiliar to 
8,000 users." 

Schaeffer's complaint is the 
frequency malfunctions. 

"It seems like WebCT is 
always broken. It is slow and I 
often have problems submitting 
homework or taking quizzes and 
tests, Sometimes when I am tak- 
ing quizzes, the questions won't 
show up," she stated. 

Vitz mentioned, "There are 
occasional downtimes that may 
obstruct the educational proces- 
sion. If distance faculty and stu- 
dents are true to flexibility, one of 
the primary beauties of online edu- 
cation, these occasional setbacks 
can be overcome with little or no 
damage." 

He also points out that WebCT 
Vista has several positive aspects. 

It offers "numerous communi- 
cation, evaluation, and other tools, 
enabling i 
turn behind 



Vitz also said that, "This 
allows IPFW to offer courses with 
extremely flexible scheduling to 



everyone, including those with 

employment, family, or other cir- 
cumstances that might prevent

Moore points out that not all 
classes are suitable for an online 
format, like WebCT. He cited phi- 
losophy as an example because it 
would be more beneficial for stu- 
dents to be able to hold a conversa- 
tion in the classroom. 

Vista also has a few not so 
great characteristics that have been 
giving users some grief. 

What can students do when 
they are experiences problems? 

Moore is always reiterating to 
his students, "Call the Help Desk." 
Bob Kostrubanic, Director of 
IT Services, said, "The IPFW Help 
Desk is responsible only for aiding 
the user in establishing and main- 
taining connectivity to the Vista 
application, and gaining entrance 
to the course." 

Vitz elaborated on how the IT 
Services Help Desk helps students 
with their WebCT woes. 

"The Help Desk personnel 
take the user through a series of 
steps (Java plugin, browser tune- 
up, uninstall search bars) in efforts 
to resolve the users' issues. If this 
is unsuccessful, they will acquire 
specific information from the user 
and create a track that is assigned 



to the WebCT group," Vitz added. 

"If a problem can't be quickly 
resolved by the IPFW Help Desk, it 
is turned over to the Vista Group in 
West Lafayette. If they can't solve 
it, they involve the WebCT compa- 
ny's technical support team," 
Kostrubanic added. 

Online education is here to 
stay at IPFW, and Vitz sees WebCT 
as being part of that. 

"I see WebCT as becoming 
more popular at IPFW, with usage 
increasing exponentially," he said. 

Schaeffer will also continue to 
take classes that have a WebCT 
component. 

"I enjoy the benefits of at 
home learning. I think that the 
benefits outweigh the problems," 
she stated. 

Vitz also noted, "Being among 
the first to adopt Vista, we 
(Purdue) put ourselves at the risk 
of encountering previously undis- 
covered bugs, which has happened 
and created some grief." 

He explained it put IPFW in a 
position of shaping the future of 
the product and to meet out specif- 
ic needs — which has already hap- 
pened. 

"In my mind, the tradeoff was 
worth it. Going with Vista was the 
right decision, especially consider- 
ing the ugly alternative of staying 
with WebCT 3.8." ■

"It makes for an interesting mix. 
We have students who are going 
for credit and travelers are going 
non-credit. There's lot of benefits 
with that. We get adult travelers 
who bring their life experiences 
who may not be doing coursework 
but they are sharing in the conver- 
sation," Kubik said. 

The class assignments include 
diagramming a floor plan of a site 
or writing poetry or a short essay. 

"We don't expect people to be 
artistic, but to express themselves 
and what they're learning. And 
then we grade that on the spot. 
There's no coming home and writ- 
ing a 10-page paper," Kubik 
explained. "Even.' minute of ever&gt; F 
day is part of your learning, and 
the whole city is the classroom," he 

Adams noted the interactive 
uniqueness of INTR 220. 

"It's not like a standard class- 
room. You do get lectures, but you 
have it there in front of you. You 
can touch it and feel it. It's a whole 
lot different," he said. 

There are many reasons to visit 
Rome, according to Kubik. It is an 
event dedicated to cultural literacy 
as much as the classwork. 

"Rome is a city that has been 
continuously inhabited for almost 
3,000 years. It represents a layering 
ofcultur ' 



,in architecture history type course 
where we can look at things from 
prehistory to modern times all in 
one place," he said. 

And although the course con- 
centrates on architectural designs 
and history, so much more can be 
gleamed from the time in Rome. 

"The roots of our government, 
our political system, our monetary 
system, our legal system, our lan- 
guage, our religion and philosoph- 
ical systems all relate back to Rome 
and from Rome back to Greece," 
kubik explained. 

This is also a chance to experi- 



jpla.

"Often people take the approach 
that they're going to go see 10 cities 
in two weeks. You may see a lot, 
but you don't absorb a lot," he said. 

Absorbing it became a thrill for 
Adams. 

"It's a totally different culture. 
It's just shocking It's paradise. It's 
completely different," he said. He 
recalled the changes between 
American and Italian culture, 
being thrown off a bit by cold soup, 
cool wine and the fact that most 
beverages were served warm. 

The Colosseum and the Forum 
awed Adams; he was amazed by 
the design of the Colosseum and 
the history the structures represent. 

"You walk into the Forum and 
you have the tomb of Julius Caesar 
in there. )ust to know that he was 
here and he walked around this 
area, in these buildings. You hear 
about all these stories and where 
they took place - and then you're 
there. You can touch pieces of stone 
and marble that they've touched 
and crafted," he explained.

IPFW junior Todd Adams enjoys a ciesta while traveling 
in Rome in 2002. Adams, who is studying building 
design, is suffering from being "Rome Sick" since falling 
in love with the Italian city two years ago. He plans on 
returning next year. 



Returning to Rome is penciled 
in for him. 

"I want to go back. Next year, 
I'm going back, I don't know how, 
but I'm going," Adams said. 

Kubik said that's not an uncom- 
mon situation for travelers to want 
to get back to the Italian city. 



"It's called being 'Rome sick/" 
Kubik explained.

excursion this year should contact

the need for an increase in the 
amount of computers available for 
24-hour student use. It is my belief 
that the current 24-hour lounge, no

and opportunities it once did. I

the acceptable level of education

Word of the Week: 
Procrastinate 



It's currently 1 a.m. on the Tuesday morning before deadline. For the past 
hour, I have been sitting on the office couch, desperately seeking inspiration for 
a column. My position on the couch - head thrown back, mouth open, eyes 
glassy and staring at the ceiling - is one many college students have been in 
before. It's no drug-induced haze, though: its the comatose drool-phase of pro- 
fessional procrastination. 

Most of us ha ve spent our entire lives refining the art ol procrastination. In ele- 
mentary school, homework was fun, and we spent many happy hours match- 
ing the shapes to the colors ,ind doing simple addition As we grew, however, 
homework mutated into tins tanged monster that sucked up our evenings and 
nights, consumed our mornings and lunch periods, and became a medically 
certifiable obsession in our everyday lives Of course, in high school, we never 
really did get that much homework, but we were just beginning our careers as 
procrastinators and couldn't handle a real workload I distinctly remember 
doing math in the hallways at lunch, homework in one period for the period 
coming up next, and sneaking off to the bathroom to finish up those last ten 
pages in English so 1 wouldn't fail the quiz. 

Now that we've graduated to college, we have more freedoms than we did in 
high school. Procrastination has been driven to new heights: now we wait to 
start researching that 2&lt;) p.ige paper until about 12 hours before it's due, blow 
off math homework completely and postpone tests for any reason we can pos- 
sibly convince ourselves is even close to worthy. It is possible to find students 
fiat passed out in the Fireside Lounge, the couches in Helmke Library, or the 
benches in Kettler Hall. If they aren't asleep, they're doing homework, doubt- 
less due in mere minutes. Between classes, students from all over campus 
scramble like rats in a cage to touch up that last bit of a presentation, spell check 
that essay one more time, make sure all the exponents ,ire properly computed, 
and slug down another Mountain Dew to keep those lead-weighted evelids 
open for another hour. 

Doesn't anyone ever do homework the day it is assigned? 

Yes. There are people who gel a solid eight hours of sleep ever)' night, have a 
4.0, always make their bed and eat healthy These people also have no lives. An 
hour of leisure time a day is simply unacceptable for the majority of us tipsy col- 
lege students We are excessively fond of our alcohol, our friends, and our sleep.

Technology and the classroom: 

Misadventures in 'puter wonderland lead 
to frustrations, revelations 



I remember the days many 
years ago when I was in my early 
years of high school, technology 
was just beginning to creep insidi- 
ously into the schools, not merely 
in the form of a never-used lab of 
ancient Apple computers, but as a 
bright and gleaming lab of 
Windows-based computers that 
teachers held in constant use. 
Rather than the standard report, 
students were now expected to 
give PowerPoint presentations on 
World War II and turn in brochures 
on health designed in Microsoft 
Publisher. The age of technology 
was grandly ushered in — but 
somewhere along the way, I think I 
was left out. 

While in high school I adapt- 
ed as best I could to the digital rev- 
olution (I even earned a now- 
worthless technical certification); 
but this semester has shown me 
just how out-of-sync with the 
advances in classroom tech I really 
am. I sit in front of a computer at 
my fine place of employment all 
day long. Yet, the minute I come 
home or go to school something 
happens in my brain chemistry 
that turns me into a complete, com- 
puter-illiterate idiot. 

In one of my classes (one of 
my favorites, actually) we are 
expected to participate in an online 
forum, discussing what we have 
read, posting our writing assign- 
ments and giving reactions to other 
people's work. 

What I have found {and this is 
nobody's fault but my own) is that 
there are few assignments easier to 
put off than those online writing 
postings. I tell myself I have plenty 



of time to do it, I won't have any 
trouble getting it done later, and 
next thing I know, it's been two 
weeks and I can't remember exact- 
ly what you were supposed to 
write about — or what my pass- 
word is to even get into the site. 

However bumbling 1 may be on 
the online forum, this cannot even 
hold a candle to my recent experi- 
ences in another one of my class- 
es — the online "listserv." Though I 
understand the design and inten- 
tion of this class, I have never 

with computers and more frustra- 
tion than in this digital realm. Keep 
in mind that I actually love this 



grade in peril. 

This class requires one to sign 
up to a listserv account; "no prob- 
lem," I thought to myself. "This 
should be interesting." The class is 
centered on discussion, and I 
looked forward to reading and 
answering emails at my own pace. 

Ah, the idyllic first few days 
of every class, when we don't real- 
ize exactly what we have gotten 
ourselves into. To spare the details 
and cut to the point, I now have 
three different email addresses 
signed up on the iistsev, and one of 
them is signed up twice. This 
means that I get each message four 
times. No matter how wonderful 
the post may be, systematically 
deleting the message on three dif- 
ferent systems proves more than 
tolerable on most days. Moreover, 
just imagine when four or five peo- 
ple send out two or three emails 
each— it boggles the mind to think 
of just how much trouble I have 
put myself into by trying to fix the 
problem myself. 

What makes it even better is 
that although I receive each mes- 



sage, my email system(s) will only 
allow me to post my messages 
when the system(s) feel like it 
Thank you, AOL. There are few 
experiences like staying up at 3 
a.m. in a futile attempt to pray to 
the Internet gods to allow your 
email to get through — just one 
email, with a tiny little attach- 
ment — but hear no answer despite 
sacrificing a wireless network card. 

Once again, self-remedies did- 
n't work as my most recent mes- 
sage intended for the group, sent 
twice of course, ended up as unin- 
telligible babble with squares and 
question marks (much different 
than the English babbie original). 
Bleary-eyed and realizing that I 
had to get up in about three hours, 
I wrote a final message intended 
for the moderator of the group at 
around 4 a.m.; of course, that mes- 
sage was deemed worthy by AOL 
to be sent through, but to all of 
members of the listserv instead of 
just to the moderator. 

The use of technology pres- 
ents the clearest example of .1 dou- 
ble-edged sword in recent times. 
Indeed, though I have had more 
trouble with these two classes than 
any other time with computers in 
my lifetime, I have also seen some 
wonderful discussions crop up in 
both classes that might not have 
been the same in class. 
Additionally, as I am either too 
meek to speak up (or asleep) in 
class, these forums give me and 
other people like me a second 
chance to participate in the discus- 

I appreciate and advocate the 
idea of bringing technology into 
the classroom — it is important to 
be connected. It just appears that I 
have the wrong number. 



When good ideas go too far: 

If we can ban the smokers, can we ban the stupid people, too? 



of a television set during the past 
couple of years, and memories of 
mannequins, people in rat cos- 
tumes, and baby dolls flood their 
minds. The local smoking ban 
took effect in May of 1999 and 
basically states that smoking is 
prohibited unless smokers are 
placed into a room that is separat- 
ed (floor to ceiling) from the rest 
of the non-smoking section, or if 
the smoking is taking place in a 
private club and restaurant (most 
commonly bar situations). 

Having friends that smoke, 
I've often heard the complaints of 
being in that bracket between 
being old enough to smoke and 
too young to go to the bars. There 
are few places in town that have 
made accommodations for smok- 
ers that don't involve a bar. There 
have been nights that our dinner 
plans have revolved around 
restaurants that would accommo- 
date the people involved, and 
we've driven out of our way to go 
to the handful of these places in 

There have been nights when 
my parents (who smoke) and I 
can't even find a place for dinner. 
As a 20 year old, I couldn't accom- 
pany my parents into a bar situa- 
tion at restaurants so that they 
could smoke. Indiana Code states 
that there are exceptions to the 
rules about minors being in "tav- 
erns" if they are over the age of 18 
and being accompanied by their 
legal guardian or family member 
that is age 21 or older, and are 
present to purchase food. 

However, even with alt of 
this background, I still under- 
stand the fact that they are trying 
to make a healthier situation. 
Both smokers and non-smokers 
go out with the intention of enjoy- 
ing themselves. Non-smokers, 
when trapped in rooms with a 
number of smokers are forced to 
inhale large quantities of smoke 
that they don't want. 
Restaurants, bars, buses, air- 



planes, and trains, I understand 
all of these, you're doing nothing 
but forcing smoke into the lungs 
of people around you. However, 
there are times that even I am 
forced to sit back and ask what 
the heck is going on. 

California, the pioneer of the 
non-smoking bans for restaurants 
has once again gone where no 
state has gone before. Last 
September, Solana Beach was the 
first city to ban smoking at the 
beach, however San Clemente and 
Santa Monica are likely to follow 
suit. Now smokers aren't even 
allowed to smoke on the beaches 
of this country. 

Some argue that the smoking 
ban is to help keep the beach a 
healthy place to be for small chil- 
dren and for non-smokers. They 
are using the same basic argu- 
ments as they did when they were 
fighting on the restaurant bans. 
Non-smokers don't want to be 
affected by smoke from the smok- 
ers so it's their right to have non- 
smoking beaches. 

Well I'll tell you what; I don't 
really want to put up with stupid 
people. Maybe we should make 
places dumbass-free. It's my right 
not to be offended by their stupid- 
ity, and their ignorance makes my 
head hurt, therefore, it's a health 
concern. Where is my task force? 
Where are my lobbyists? Where 
are my "Truth" commercials? 

Some will argue that the ban 
is to prevent litter on the beach. 
They say that wet butts account 
for litter problems on local beach- 
es. Well, pop cans and candy 
wrappers are left scattered on the 
beaches, and that damages the 
environment too. Maybe food- 
free beaches are the next wave of 
legislation. I know I'm offended 
when a Snickers wrapper blows 
by my feet, or gum sticks to my 

I know there are people who 
go to the beach to enjoy some 
peace and quiet. Screaming kids 
do nothing to help the search for 
quiet. I'm sure these children give 



are pretty offended every t 
SUV full of screaming ankle-bit 
pulls up and empties out. I 



sure they are bothered every time 
a sticky-faced toddler runs into 
them as the child isn't looking 
where he's going. Hell, why don't 
we make the beaches child-free as 

Besides that, who is going to 
enforce this new law, the police? 1 
know I'd feel safer knowing that 
the police are making sure that a 
grown adult isn't out having a 
smoke at the beach on a nice 
warm day. Maybe the lifeguard's 
will be taking care of this, that's 
even more reassuring. I know I'd 
feel safer out in the water know- 
ing that my portion of the life- 
guards time is now being spent 
making sure that someone down 
the beach isn't enjoying a cool 
menthol cigarette. 

Just because we don't live 
near the ocean and have miles of 
beaches at which to spend our 
free time at, doesn't mean we here 
in Fort Wayne are isolated from 
this insanity. We have parks, we 
have outdoor public places. 
Who's to say that it's not going to 
happen here? Who's to say that 
eventually we will still enjoy the 
luxury of smoking in our own 
cars? People flick butts out the 
window and litter, and in the 
summertime, with the windows 
down, smoke travels into cars sur- 
rounding the smoker, where's the 
law there? I know that people 
have got to be offended when 
they're driving down the road 
and in wafts the smell of some 
Camel Ultra Lights. Who's to say 
that the person smoking them has 
the right to smoke them with their 
windows down? 

If we start making laws like 
this, it's only a matter of time 
before everything gets out of 
hand. You can't please everyone 
here, the key is finding balance. 
Sure, make small spaces non- 
smoking (airplanes, restaurants) 
but I really wouldn't consider the 
world too small for smokers. 

Meanwhile, I'm going to go 
call my state representative about 
the law banning public acts of stu- 
pidity, these people in the com- 

headache and I'm offended. 



Nice guys finish last? 



There is a song that begins "Nice 
guys finish last/ because they're 
runnin' out of gas." That song has 
prompted me to talk about wh.it is 
inherently right in the world. Nice 
guys do finish last. In this day and 
age, the reign of the "rock star" and 
the "corporate jet-set" guy has 
■.mashed the old days when it was 
great if a guy held a door open for 
a lady. In this time, it seems that 
most girls go for either of the two 
types stated above. The sad thing 
is, statistically they usually get hurt 
in the end. This doesn't go for say- 
ing that all of that said type above 
has ulterior motives, but having 
being a reformed "jet-set" type per- 

A dear friend of mine has been 
having problems with her "rock 
star" boyfriend. In short, he is 
treating her very horribly, This 
prompts me to wonder, why does 
this happen? I have known lots of 
people who have dated lots of dif- 
ferent types of people and rock 

taining a level of decency for the 
modern male. Granted, I do know 
a handful who do keep it clean; 
they respect their significant other 
and treat them with a level 
achieved only by a high priest. 
Anyway, this fellow she is with is 
just rude. He makes her cry and 
worry; it's very disheartening. 

Are the "Nice Guys" and "Nice 
Girls" dead? No, not in the least. 
It's just not in the form that most 
people; guys and girls are looking 
for. I won't lie; America is a visual 
culture. We look, 



We ; 






that 



simple. But in that is the way, the 
secret to hunting down and captur- 
ing the one thing most people look 
for: companionship. 

Be open. Nice people, from what 
I've known, aren't always the 
smartest or prettiest people on the 
face of our great planet. I think that 
that is the problem with our cul- 
ture. The reason they are nice is 
because they have nothing to gloat 
about, nothing to be cocky about. 
In my years, I have come to learn 
that cockiness kills a relationship 
quicker than an American soldier 
kills a foreign national. 



I ridicule both sides for this one, 
males and females. I know 1 am a 
victim of looking before I talk, just 
as 1 know that the people reading 
this have done the same. It's an 
good. You still have time to reform 
your ways. You still have a chance 
to figure it all out. Don't be afraid 
to talk to someone if he or she 
intrigues you. Don't be afraid if 
they are over-weight or have green 
hair. Don't be afraid to learn about 
someone. This is a message to peo- 
ple who think looks can get you 
everywhere. Modesty and chivalry 
outnumber you ten to one. Be 
afraid, be very afraid. 

Back to my friend, 1 won't reveal 
her name to you but you must 
know a few things. She is a sweet- 
heart of a human being. Her sense 
of humor is that of a seasoned 
comedian and her personality can 
draw a crowd easily. She has a 
wonderful laugh and is an all- 
around good human. Basically, 
your proverbial "nice girl." But 
most of all, she is funny. Laughter 
is the best medicine for any occa- 
sion, I myself go on this: "If I can 
laugh genuinely with the person I 
am dating, then I am dating a gen- 
uine person." If the laughs arc- 
there, what do you have to worry 

It bothers me when 1 see people 
like her, who deserve nothing but 
goodness and graciousness in dat- 
ing world, getting taken to the 
cleaners because of their good 
nature. Wouldn't it bother you if 
someone took advantage of your 
kindness? More to the point, 
wouldn't it bother you to be taken 
for granted? 

I close off my thoughts with reas- 
surance to all of the nice people. It 
is possible. It is easy to be torn 
apart, picked on and still come out 
cleaner on the other side Believe 
me, I know. It is possible to be hor- 
ribly hurt, mentally, emotionally or 
physically and still find some kind 
of happiness in another person. 
They could be making your sand 
which at Subway or busing your 
table at Hall's. All you have to do is 
just take a chance. They "Nice 
Guy" or "Nice Girl" you seek 
could be standing in front of you, 
proving that they do exist and 
they're just running out of gas. 



Ladies, let's grow a pair 



Ladies, how many of you have 
realized that when the other sex is 
around, you suddenly realize how 
doom and gloom your life seems? I 
mean seriously, we all seem to 
depend on males in one way or 
another, and more than we should, 
especially when it comes to our 
feelings. Have you ever realized 
that when a male is involved, your 
emotions are increased? Take for 
example how we always seem to 
let them decide if we are going to 
be happy just by the little thing- 
that they do, which is ridiculous, it 
you ask me. Like, if they remember 
what your favorite food is at the 
restaurant and order it for you 
while you are in the bathroom, or 
if, because they didn't, they sud- 
denly don't love you. Now, don't 
■,get me wrong, I too, have let some-. 
one decide if I'm going to have a 
good day or not, and that's just 
pathetic, if you ask me. I mean, 
take my last relationship. There 
were so many days that I'd just let 
him get to me, and thought that 
things weren't ok unless he was 
happy. One day I woke up and 
realized how stupid this was. We 
have fought so hard to be inde- 
pendent, yet we let someone else 
make up our minds? 

Or how about the fact that we let 
them walk all over us a lot. We let 
them make our decisions, like what 
kind of pop we're going to drink, 
what kind of eggs we like, and 



impetent that we couldn't do 
this for ourselves? When we were 
little, weren't we taught to think 
for ourselves? I know I was. And 
yet, I sit here, and let someone else 
make up my mind? We let some- 
one who thinks it's hilarious to fart 
out in public and play with them- 
selves to make up our mind? 



Also, another thing, have you 
ever noticed that if they have a 
hobby, that hobby suddenly turns 
into your hobby? I don't know 
how many times I've called a 
friend to see if they want to go 
hang out, and they are off golfing. 
Now, yes some of us love to golf, 
but many girls don't get pleasure 
out of golfing, but will do this in 
order to make a point to show how 
willing they are to make their 
boyfriends happy. Do you ever see 
them at the mall picking out 
clothes with us, telling us what 
looks good on us, and what does- 
n't? Most likely, no, unless of 
course they swing the other way, 
and well they aren't really interest- 
ed in you, they are actually inter- 
ested in the clothes. Yes, I know, 
guys don't shop, they just don't do 
it. But, yet we sacrifice ourselves to 
do something that they enjoy, even 
if we hate it ourselves, but we 
don't expect them to sacrifice 
something themselves? 

There really is no better explana- 
tion than the Hilary Duff song, 
"Inner Strength." It's just about 
how the guy's most likely not 
going to be there, and that you 
can't depend on him, you have to 
depend on yourself. 

You don t want to wake up one 
day, married, and not know what it 
is that makes you happy. For 
instance, I know a woman whose 
husband had an affair on her 
walked out on her and her daugh- 
ter, and she was left to pick up the 
crumbs. She is a very strong per- 
son, yet she had spent so much 
time trying to make him happy, she 
forgot who she was and didn't 
know what to do. Along the road, 
she started picking up on the little 
things, but, I'm sure her biggest 
regret is letting herself go, and him 
into a woman dependant on a man. 
Ladies, we've fought so hard to 
become independent, it's about 
time we start actually becoming 
independent

His latest masterpiece, "Erei

good memories of their love far out- 
weighs the bad ones. Recognizing his 
error, Joei decides he wants 
to hang on to her memory. 
But its not a matter of just 
backing out, the physical 






his 



lory for Kaufman, case in point being the 
Spike Jonze film "Being John Malkovich." 
But what separates 'Eternal Sunshine' 
from the rest of the Kaufman-penned fare 
is the undeniable affection and romance 
that is apparent in the film. 'Malkovich' 
was unbelieveably brilliant, yet such an 
emotional bummer that it's tough to con- 
nect. 'Sunshine' does not have this prob- 

Jim Carrey, who in Ihe past has 
found it difficult to shed his rubber face 
persona, does an excellent job playing 
"subdued" for this film, and using subtly 
to get the best reaction from perfect one- 
liners ("it's hard to find a memory with- 
out you," he softly tells Clementine). 
Even Winslet, who hasn't been nationally 
commercially recognized since her role as 
Rose in the blockbuster behemoth 
"Titanic," easily impresses with her 
impulsive, moody, yet likeable 
Clementine. 

During the course of their good (and 
bad) memories, we grow to love Joel and 
Clementine, no matter how doomed their 
relationship maybe. Whether or not their 
relationship lasts is the not the point. 
What Kaufman so accurately portrays, is 
that no matter how long the relationship 
(or anything for that matter) lasts, we will 
always have our memories, and that is all 
that matters. And after seeing this film, 
you won't forget that any time soon. 



Band 'Never Heard of it' 
'Unheard of no longer 



Eclectic, maybe even lile i hanging. That is 
the best way to describe the newest album 
from the best band that you have never 
heard of. 

Never Heard Of It, the do-it-yourself 
Los Angeles pop-punkers hit a new high 
on their new refease "tl Days." An album 
so varied, that it obviously contains a col- 
laboration of each member's musical 

In each note, on each song, the 

growth th.H the hand has done since their 
2002 disc "Limited Edition" is quite obvi- 
ous, Then again, up a guitarist (Greg 
Lynch, who joined the band in Larlv 200.''). 
a new bassist (Rick Avery, who replaced 
long 

standing member Johnny Britain in the 
Summer of 2003) and through a wide 
range of drummers (finally sticking with 
Elmo Jams after three failed choice^) this 
is not the same Never Heard Of It. 

Mixing it up with three new mixes of 
songs from their 2003 EP "The New Sh't, a 
remix of "Limited Edition" favorite 
"Satisfied" and seven very new and lughK 
original tracks, "11 Days" is everything 
thai personifies a good independent pop 
punk album. 

The lead track "Let's go all the way," 
brings you full force into the disc. No real 
intro is needed as this track, full of hard 
guitar cords and sing along vocals, kicks 
off on high note with vocalist DJ 
DelTOsa's powerful verse. 

From there, the beats keeping going 
faster. Jams' hits hard in the percussion 
department as Lynch and Jeff Ahenberg 
come harder than most songs with power- 



ful blasts from their guitars 
on "Hard Headed." Adding 
in Lynch's background 
vocals and a range of tones 
.from Dell'Osa, "Hard 
Headed" stands out. 

NHOI slows it up a bit 
on the disc's most melodic 
tracks "This is Goodbye" and 
"It's Not Possible." While the 
instrumental still hit hard 
on parts, the slower verses of 
Dell'Osa are met with calm- 
ing strikes from Avery, 
Anenberg and Lynch. 

It's these songs, which is 
best at showcasing the range 
that NHOI has established 
since "Limited Edition." 

While not the most 
standout track, Ihe group's 
first single "I'll Change for 
Now" has a few strong 
points. Namely, the groups 
chant" of a portion of the 
chorus with a steady bass 
drum beat in the back- 
ground. 

However, it also show- 
cases one of the weaker parts 
of NHOI's range, as the song 
is more repeated chorus than 
fresh verses. 

NHOI breaks out hard 
with a surprising and break- 
out track at the end of the 
disc with "She's a dick." The 
lyrics on this track are prob; 



that most male fans who have s 

gul problems can relate to with lines such 
as "I've always tried to do my best, now I 
wait in line to try to past the test," and the

What happened to Rock 'n' Roll? What hap- 
pened to the days when music meant something! 
Words had meaning full of soulful ' 
would move the masses to places like Asbury 
Park, the L.A. Forum and the Whisky A-Go-Go. It 
drove people to cross-country pilgrimages to 
Woodstock and Washington D.C. 

As I sit in my darkened basement, cup of green 
tea to my left and a stack of old Rolling Stone 
magazines to mv right, I wonder, what happened 
to Rock'n'Roll? A soothing song by Led Zepplin 
rolls out of my stereo and carries me up a winding 
"Stairway lo Heaven" and Robert Plant asks, 
"Does anybody remember laughter?" I think back 
to the first time I tested this hellion called Rock 'n' 
Roll. It was in the form of a man named Bruce 
Springsteen and he wassinging about how the 
music affected him. 

It's funny, when I sit back and look at my 
album collection, I see the virtual story of Rock 'n' 
Roll. It's not a story of written word, but of song 
and verse, of good times and bad times. 

It's is a story that started with a hip-shaking 
hillbilly from Memphis, Tennessee named Elvis 
Presley. He went on live TV and sang about things 
no one had heard about and did things no one 
had seen. He tossed away the rule booK of mod- 
ern music and wrote it on the back of his guitar 
case in the form of "Rockabilly." It was spurred on 
by the Ekes of Chuck Berry and a Texan named 
Buddy Holly. It was ushered into the 60s by a 
band of true originals from Liverpool named The 
Beatles. They were followed by an airship coming 
over the pond named "Led Zeppelin," with its 
passengers, "The Who" and "The Rolling Stones." 

Rock 'n' Roll had experienced its first meta- 
morphism in those early years. Something that 
was simply American had flown over from 
England on a magic carpet and was reinvented. 
Rock 'n' Roll had been resurrected with golden 
wings and those wings were named John, Paul, 
George and Ringo. 

From there, Rock 'n' Roll traveled North to the 
"Motor City" to be transformed once again. But 
this time, "Father Funk" and "Mother Soul" gave 
birth to a child of Rock'n'Roll that they called 
Motown. Bore of musical passion, it nurtured chil- 
dren of its own named Marvin Gaye, The 
Temptations and Aretha Franklin to name a few. It 
soothed the soul of many a man in a time of polit- 
ical and social unrest and asked everyone in 
America the question: "What's Goin' On?" 
Rock'n'Roll had evolved once again in his short 



gles of Vietnam. But when he returned home, his 

Hippies had ridden into town. Out of the sun- 
set in a tie-dye Volkswagen Buses named Crosby, 
Stills, Nash and Young, Bob Dylan and Joni 
Mitchell. They clashed with the "psychedelics" of 
the rock age named Jimi Hendrix, Jefferson 
Airplane and The Doors. The two warring groups 
fought for control of Rock 'n' Roll. But over time 
neither side won. They both went the way of 
many of their forefathers. Their movement was 
quashed, their fire put out. So Rock 'n' Roll did 
what he had done for so many years and so many 

He evolved. He evolved through the years 
into many more names. Disco, pop, punk, emo 
and rap. Each voiced by their own prophet with 
the desire to lead the masses. Abba, Michael 
Jackson, The Ramones, The Get Up Kids and a 
lone band of Compton bad boys going by the han- 
dle of N.W.A. 

Rock 'n' Roll had become a product of his own 
way. He drifted away into the minds and memo- 
ries of those who had experienced him. He fell 
into decay as Jimi overdosed and Elvis keeled 
over. He traveled to a "Hotel California" with The 
Eagles and eventually passed his last breath as 
John Lennon lay dying. Until the day a middle- 
class "New Jersey Devil" by the name of Bruce 
Springsteen sang him into the hearts of a country 
in distress — with the help of an Indiana farm-boy 
by the name of Johnny Cougar -- they helped 
usher in a new decade for Rock n' Roll. The fire to 
be tended by the likes of Van Halen and Bon Jovi. 
But then he drifted away again. He had saved his 
people from recession and rejection. Had filtered 
of life and love to a generation who

Until another ti .. 
the day that Rock 'n' Roll rears its kamikazenead, 
guitar in hand and goes streaking across the sky 
on a lightning bolt for all in the world to see. 
Proving to listeners everywhere that it ain't no sin 
to be glad you're alive. But until that day, I sit and 
I listen, for the tell tale sign that he is right around 
the comer. 

Does anyone remember laughter?

All in all, "She's .1 dick" stands out 
the most on a very stand out 
album. Avery's varied bass 
stylings are most strong on this 
track as well. Another reason the 
track tops on the list is strong Kick- 
up vocals, something NHOI has 



"Satisfied," which was actually on 
"Limited Edition." This new ver- 
sion, done for the first time with 
Avery, Jams and Lynch is a far bet- 
ter version, mostly for the afore- 
mentioned back-up vocals that 
NHOI never really tried to master 
with their previous lineups. 

And, as always with NHOI 
discs, minutes after the final song 
wraps, there is a "hidden track,' 
which by far best showcases the 
band's wild personalities. This 
time around, instead ot praising 
tequila (as they do on ' Limited 
Edition" and "The New Sh*t"), the 
group mocks their state's newest 
governor with pure perfection. 

The disc is perhaps on of the 
best in history from a band with- 
out a label. It has a complete pro- 
fessional appearance and sound, 
showing that NHOI doesn't need a 
flashy name or corporate label to 
prove that they are the best thing 
that you have never heard of.

prepares you for t his office? How 

will it help vou excel? 

None that is what is so great. I 
wanted to gel involved in student 
government so in January 04 I 
picked up an application. Then, I 
wanted to get further involved, 
and that is why 1 am running for 
V.P. Of Programming. I may not be 
qualified now, but if there is one 
thing that I have learned from the 
l-.ngineering program at IPFW is 
that things that seem impossible 
can be overcome with a little bit of 
time and perseverance. I want to 
surpass all the responsibilities with 
all of my abilities and leave IPFW 
knowing that I made a significant 
difference.

I want to brine, more activities 
to IPFW With the dorms coming in 
the Fall, there are going to be so 
many things that we can do that we 
could not do before. I desire to 
bring live local bands to IPFW. I 
would like to make SAB more of a 
known name and have a great time 
doing it too.

really want to be involved at IPFW. 
There is not much Mastodon pride 
here on campus. It seems that 
everyone I talk lo has plans to go to 
Ball State or Purdue. I want people 



Page 3 

to say that they are staying here 
and they love it. IPFW is growing 
faster than ever and ideally I want 
to see students talk about campus 
events like they are the only event 
to be at. 

Erin McConaha 

Candidate 

Student Body 

Vice President of Programming 

Autobiography: 

My name is Erin McConaha 
and I am 22 years old. I have been 
at IPFW for four years and I am 
studying to gel a degree in psy- 
chology. 



I am running fur re-election 
because I want to continue the 
work I have already started. I?ve 
implemented several programs 
and I am excited about others I?d 
like to bring lo campus in the 
future. There is not enough time 
remaining in this term for me to 
make these ideas a reality. So, I 
would like the chance to have one 
more year to accomplish these 
goaJs. 



\\ li.lt !■■ pencil, e l|,2_J Mil ll.uc lh_.il 

prepares you lor thisoll iie? I low 
will it help you excel? 

I am currently serving in this 
position. I have been the V.P. of 
Programming for two years. 
Before that 1 served as a S.A.B. 
board member where I learned all 
the workings of S.A.B. I have held 
several positions in other student 
organizations thai have helped me 



to develop leadership and interper- 
sonal skills. I have also been on 
several Chancellor Committees. I 
have been on this campus for four 
years so I have gained an insight 
into what types of programming 
students want. The programs that 
I have already brought to campus 
were well received by the students.

If I am re-elected, I would like 
to continue to insure there are 
diverse programs available on 

campus to educate and to unite our 
multi-cultural student body. 

If you could change, anything 

about the campus, what would it 

be and why? 



If I could change anything 
about the campus, it would be to 
change the student attitude about 
the lack of activities available to 
them on the campus or sponsored 
by the campus. The campus has 
some fantastic programs, not only 
SAB programs, but oilier organiza- 
tional and departmental programs 
available to students. 

Unfortunately, they are not always 
taken advantage of. I will contin- 
ue to support and advertise these 
programs to the student body. 



Tony Wilson

Student Body 
Vice President of Fin 



My name is Tony Wilson, I am 
a 22-year-old fourth year senior, 
OLS and finance major, and I am 

also a member ol the 1 PI-AY baseball 



Why are vou running tor this 
office? 

I am running for this office 
because I enjoy watching and want 
to contribute in helping IPFW 
grow. I want to brine, organization 
and new ideas to office, while help- 
ing the IPFW student body in any- 
thing ihey need. 

What experience do vou have that 

prepares \ mi tor ihis office? How 

will it help vou excel? 

In being a student-athlete and 
working at school for the past four 
years at IPFW, I have developed 
many friendships and have net- 
worked myself to many of my 
peers. I am also a part of the 
Student Senate and have most of 
my business degree completed. 
Put all of these experiences togeth- 
er, and I feel that they have ade- 
quately prepared me for office. 

How do you hope to help students 

if you're elected? What kind of 

pro grams or plans would you like 

to contribute to IPFW? 

When I am elected, I plan of 
helping the students with any mat- 
ters that they have. I will have 
readily available office hours and I 
will do anything in my power to 
help them. I would like to focus 
on some of the programs that are 
pushing IPFW to a more tradition- 
al campus. Being a student athlete, 
I will push helping boost student 
attendance at home athletic events. 
I also would like to see more big- 
time concerts offered by IPFW, that 
traditional campuses usually 



be and why? 

If I could change anything at 
IPFW, it would be the general atti- 
tude of students that IPFW is a 
commuter school and anything 
outside of class work is not worth 
attending. IPFW offers many 
great programs and I feel that 
many events and programs aren't 
utilized enough by the students. 
The only way to change this is to 
increase student interest and 
involvement and that is one of my 
major goals in office.

Bertuzzi incident 
opens door for more 
violence in sports 



So when did it become part 

of the norm to break someone's 

neck? When did our society dete- 

ate to the point where 



Yes, the incident, to which I 
am referring: The Todd Bertuzzi 
Incident" is weeks in the past But 
it is a display of the downward 
spiral that the sporting society is 

This is hockev. Figlilioi; .md 
to a certain extent violence, are 



premeditated 



blurred the lines of what is too 
violent. Bertuzzi crossed the line 
and 1 am not sure how many peo- 
ple don't see that, especialh the 



the NHL took a sport already in 
the decline back another 10 to 15 
years. Why? Because they sus- 
pended Bertuzzi for a very slight 
27 games. Now how is thr.it going 
to teach him a lesson? 

Beyond teaching him a les- 
son, how is a 27 game punish- 
ment going to make up for what 
Bertuzzi did to Steve Moore, not 
to mention his family and his 

Todd Bertuzzi is a criminal. 
Plain and simple. If a man on the 
street were to do the things that 
Bertuzzi did on the ice that night, 
he would be in prison. 

Perhaps even for a long time. 
And that is where Bertuzzi 
should be. 

Allowing things such as his 
attack on Moore has opened the 
doors to more violence, especially 
in the more violent sports. What 
stops overwhelming violence in 
both outdoor and indoor foot- 



I do not believe for a second 
that Bertuzzi meant to break 
Moore's neck. I do 
believe, as anyone who saw the 
incident should, that he meant to 
hint Moore. But 

he did. It was still assault. And 27 
games and $500,000 hardly make 
up for that transgression. 

Over the past five years or 
so, violence has become ridicu- 
lous in sports. The number 
of bench clearing brawls in base- 
ball has been overwhelming, 
especially 
the Ited Sox/Yankees brawl of a 






old 



i (Jell Van Gundy) at the bot- 
tom of a pile, seemingly biting 
Alonzo Mourning's ankle. 



iolence into the ESPN 
Bertuzzi doesn't deserve 27 
games. Bertuzzi doesn't deserve a 
year suspension. Bertuz/i should 
be kicked out of the NHL...iorev- 

A standard (,i very low stan- 
dard) has been set. For a league 
on the verge of extinction, the 
NHL better find a better way to 
deal with this standard and give 
Bertuzzi what he deserves If they 
don't, then I may soon feel like I 
am watching war in the middle 
east on CNN everytime my 11 
p.m. Sportscenter plays. 



Mastodon Stomp 

from Page One 

Mastodon Stomp this year and dedi- 
cating it to Tony was the right thing to 
do," said Tillapaugh. 

Tillapaugh mentioned Laux ran 
in the inaugural event, and it was one 
of his favorite walk/run events and 
that the course that will be used is 
one that Laux used often to train on. 

A ceremony before the event, 
will honor Laux. 

Students, non-students and 
other members of the community can 
still register. There is a fee for stu- 
dents and kids of $5, and a $12 entry 
fee for non-students. After March 27, 
the fee for non-students will increase 
to $15. Entry forms can be picked up 
at the athletic department, or partici- 
pants can show April 3 with their fee 
and still participate. 

Registration can be made from 
7:30-9:00 a.m. and the 5K event will 
start promptly at 9. The 1-Mile Kids
