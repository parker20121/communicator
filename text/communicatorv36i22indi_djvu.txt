Actually, kids who love amuse- 
ment parks _ bless their tacky 
litde hearts _ will probably 
prefer the faux tropical world 
of the Dells to a truly exotic 
tropical locale. There are more 
games here, more inventive 
ways to experience water and 
more thrills. Plus, there are no 
bugs, no sand to

simply because the sun has set, 
and no sunburns. 

Or wait, there could be 
sunburns soon. One of the 
18 indoor water parks in the 
Dells, as the area a two-hour 
drive northwest of Milwaukee 
is called, is in the process of 
erecting a new water park with 
a so-called Foil Tech roof that 
allows ultraviolet rays to pass 
through. The first such roof in 
the United States, it creates the 
possibility that you could visit 
here and go home bragging 
that you got your winter tan in

80 percent and routinely hit

The Communicator 



Podium 



Letter to the Editor 



Illegal immigration 
editorial offensive 



The February 1 issue of The 
Communicator included an editorial 
and its accompanying cartoon that 
served to do little more than to add fuel 
lo the fire to the issues of, not only illegal 
immigration, but also the racist and 
antagonistic attitudes of cthnocentrism. 
Not only was it poorly written, but its 
message also clearly demonstrated t 



While the illegality of undocumented 
Immigrants is a rather moot point, the 
suggestion that anyone residing on 
American soil should be singled out 
for discriminatory practices that have 
essentially nothing lo do with their legal 
status runs counter to the American 
spirit of fair play. 

The United States' policies on 
immigration, legal or illegal, have always 
been dependent on the socio-economic 
and political climate of the times and 
have consistently remained ambiguous. 
particularly as regards immigrants from 
Mexico and Latin America. 

There is ample evidence to support 
the claim that in times of a shortage 
In the U.S. labor force, America opens 
lis doors and temporarily welcomes 
immigrants, primarily for menial labor 
and to meet the needs of the agricultural 
market (e.g. the Bracero Program, which 
was allowed m expire in 1964). 

Additionally. 



lo the United States ami perform work 
that most Americans will not; however, 
it is debatable whether or not legal 
immigrants are willing to also take 
on such menial labor on a long-term, 
permanent basis. 

Further, the editorial displayed its 
racist tondeniicshysingli ngcrn i speakers 
of the Spanish language, which, although 
Mexican immigration, both legal and 
illegal, has grown considerably in the 
past decade, it is far from the singular 
representative of undocumented 
immigration in the United States. 

And, as for the claim that "nobody 
speak English

there is confusion 

with 'true Americans' who don't know 
Spanish", both native-born Americans 
and immigrants have succeeded in 
American business while overcoming 
any struggles with language barriers and 
oilier supposedly insurmountable odds. 
Finally, the editorial displayed its 
racist tendencies and discriminatory 
altitude with its suggestion for finding 
and deporting illegal immigrants. The 
concept of using Wells Fargo

of immigrants from Mexico, one should 
keep in mind that, as they are fond of

(As a side note, I might add that 
while these undocumented workers 
arrive seeking to better themselves 
economically and to contribute 
positively lo American society, there are 
those documented immigrants who have 
performed terrorist acts on Americans). 

Asa native-born American of Mexican 
heritage, I am taking this opportunity to 
express my displeasure, not to mention 
my disappointment, with the editorial 
staff of The Communicator for ils 
display of such a biased editorial and 
cartoon that indirectly singles out and 
discriminates against one particular 
ethnic group. 

It is my hope that future 
Communicator editorials and articles 
will demonstrate its capacity for respect 
and impartiality.

Port sale hazardous to U.S. 



Staff Editorial 



A small part of the 9/11 
commission's report talks 
about a possible connection 
between the United Arab 
Emirates and Osama bin 
Laden several years ago. Their 
intelligence from local sources 
stated, "bin Laden regularly 
went from his adjacent camp 
to the larger camp where he 
visited the Emirates." Now, 
the Bush administration 
wants to let a company from 
the United Arab Emirates take 
over United States ports. 

Not only is the United Arab 
Emirates possibly connected 
to bin Laden, but the largest 
city in that country is Dubai. 
This city is thought to be 
the main banking center for 
funds of AlQaeda. Half of the 
money spent on September 
11. 2001 by the hijackers, 



roughly $250,000, was wired 
to the terrorists in the U.S. 
by Dubai banks. Two of the 
hijackers were actually from 
the United Arab Emirates. 

The she ports are located 
in Miami, New Orleans, 
Baltimore, Philadelphia, New 
York, and Newark, New Jersey. 
This will mean that a foreign 
company, not to mention 
from the Middle East, will 
have control over ports in the 
Gulf of Mexico and all the way 
up the Atlantic coast. 

Republicans and . 

Democrats alike are righting 
against this deal. President 
Bush has also promised to 
veto any bill that could 
possibly stop the business 

Republican representative 
Sue Myrick, Republican- 



North Carolina, wrote a letter 
to President Bush and posted 
on her website. 

Myrick stated, "In regards 
to selling American ports to 
the United Arab Emirates, not 
just no, but hell no." 

Senator Robert Menendez, 
Democrat- New Jersey, 
stated, "We can't rely on 

from foreign governments 
to secure our ports. If the 
Bush administration will not 
stop this deal from closing, 
Congress must." 

President Bush said that 
American's do not need to be 
worried about security. 

Turning over our ports 
could just give terrorists an 
easier way into our country.

That is Ihe All-American concept of

With so many ways for a criminal to 
slide out of a crime, the largest escape 
route nowadays is pleading guilty due to 
insanity. We all know of at least five cases 
within the past year that the accused has 
pled guilty with some sort of insanity plea; 
it is really just a big cop out. 

In November of 2004, a woman named 
Dena Schlosser was arrested when she was 
found covered in blood, knife in hand, 
while her 10-month-old baby Maggie laid 
crying in her crib, with her arms cut off. 
Dena called 911 and told them calmly that 
she had cut off her child's arms. I know this 
is a gruesome thought to handle. I cannot

but the case was closed as they concluded 
that she did not pose any immediate risk to 
her children. The agency had been Called

days old. and Dena fled the house, leaving 
the children alone. This woman clearly had

Annexing Aboite Township bad idea 



Staff Column 



Rd. The city had finally invaded Aboite Township. I'm against the 
whole annexation from the start. If 1 wanted to live in the city, I 
would have moved there after I graduated from high school. Yes, I 
go to college in Fort Wayne. So why am I complaining, right? Well, 
let me tell you something. There was not much of a choice for me 
as to what school I could go to. Out of town schools are too expen- 
sive. I should have applied for scholarships right? Wrong. My 
grades weren't that strong to even get me a little scholarship. So, I 
did what I had to do. 1 went to a school that I could afford without 
having to take out loans. 

Higher taxes? Why not, ri^lu? Alter paying those higher taxes, 
e Still don't receive .ill i lie benefits thai i he uty offers. Why am 



I complaining about the highei ta\es? Because the c 

The mayor has said that the eity musi annex in order to grow. I 
say make the city unite appealing m get people to move to the city. 
Why spread the cit\ mil over a lot of land when there isn't much to 
the downtown area except lot business .mil churches? I'm think- 
ing that the mayor should have concentrated more on how to 
attract people to the downtown area or to the city in general. 

The mayor never specified what was going to happen to the 
profits from the extra taxes that the city is going to be collecting. I 
think we have the right to know because whatever happens to the 
taxes is going to affect everyone in the city now. The city is going 
to collect an estimated v", nut I inn. wlm.h will exceed the cost of 
services and planning investment. So, where is the extra money 
going? How is it going to affect us as citizens? 

We're promised with over 300 new street signs and over 200 
street lights. Heaven knows we need more street lights. After all, 
Aboite Township is so inadequately lit. Is this where all the extra 



tax money is going? I hope so. That could benefit us greatly, espe- 
cially for people who aren't as familiar with the area. 

Another beef 1 have is the fact that we aren't going to get city 
water, but instead stay with the u. iter company we already have. 
What is the point oi heme, annexed tl we aren't ^oing to be benefit- 
ing from all the city's services? If we have to pay higher taxes now. 
we should be able to receive the services I rum t lie city. Is there not 
enough water to let us Use as well? 

The last beef I have is with National Serv- 
to be very considerate. They put the trash t 
middle of the driveway, even when they see you trying 
of the driveway. Waste management would at least put 
the grass where it was before. Yeah, you could say I'm t 
get out of my car to move it. You could say that, you j 
But they shouldn't have put it in my way to begin with \ 









And then we had a mattress we needed picked up. Kind of 
redneck for throwing out a mattress, right? Ah, whatever. That's 
beside the point. We called N.uiun.il Setv All n» make sure (hat 
they could pick it up. They said yes. lhc\ would pick it up with our 
regular trash on Monday. What did they do? They forgot to pick it 
up. We made a phone call. The lady s.ud they would pick it up the 
following Monday. KindoflikehowtheydiditthatMonday? Well, 
she didn't have an answer for that. 

The city should have let us establish our own city from the get 
go. The city isn't providing me too much mote than what I already 
had from before they annexed us. We already had our own water, 
fire stations and garbage pick up. The only thing that the city is 
giving US is recycling pick up. I- wry thine, else we are keeping I mm 
before. Well, they're also picking up our leaves. It was so much 
easier to burn them, and a lot quicker than the city.

Bush's oil policy too little, too late 



By Cameron Johnson 



It's black gold, Texas tea and now 
"America's addiction" as Bush cam- 
paigns to curb consumption of Mideast 



isthat liberals pm t H imH dec.ule-aeo, 

aside, the Orwellian PR. typical of this 
administration has left me wonder- 
ing if the overall message is double- 
plus-good or double-plus-ungood. In 
particular. I wonder if ihis oil-as-crack 
campaign is a harbinger of failure in 

Most now concede the reason we 

invaded Iraq was oil. Unfortunately, 
critiques of the war continue to hinge 
on catching evildoers, democratiza- 



it if you'll humor 
a brief review, I'll take a stab at it. 

In the early '90s Cheney and his 
buddies (the cabal) recognized our eco- 



nomic imperialism will be threatened 
when we start running low on oil, and 
they were upset that Bush senior didn't 
take over the third largest reserves when 
he had the chance. Wolfewilz (then 
iinder-secrc'iaryl petulanily expressed 
the cabal's sentiments by crafting an 
Iraq case study as a primary scenario in 
a set of geopolitical military guidelines 
submitted to the Pentagon. As a result, 
the CIA dubbed them "the crazies," 
and a controversy erupted when it was 
leaked to the media. G. H. W. ordered 
Cheney to rewrite the guidelines, but 
those original blueprints for the Iraq 
invasion were not discarded. 

Cheney's first assignment with W's 
administration was head of the Energy 
Task Force. He immediately commis- 
sioned a report titled "Strategic Energy 
Policy Challenges for the 21st Century." 
Shortly after it landed in the Oval Office 
and half a year before Sept. 1 1 , Bush's 
cabinet agreed on the following policy: 
i destabilizing influence

iniliiarv 



"The Project for the New American 
Century (PNAC)," a son of neo-con- 
servativc "Mien Kampf" supposedly 
endorsed back in 2000 by Bush and 
Cheney's cabal: "the need for a sub- 
stantial American force presence in 
the Gulf transcends the issue of the 
regime of Saddam Hussein...the pro- 
cess of Imilitaryl transformation, even 
if it brings revolutionary change, is 
likely to be a long one, absent some 
catastrophic and catalyzing event -- 
like a new Pearl Harbor." 

They got their wish. 

Upon entering Iraq the goal was to 
stabilize and increase oil production 
to 3 million barrels/day. So, how have 

Since entering Iraq there have been 
over 300 attacks on the oil infrastruc- 
ture. In December, production sta- 
bilized at an average of 1.57 million 
barrels a day, well below the pre-war 
average of 2.5. 

Oil is Iraq's source of revenue and 
reconstruction suffers for lack of antic- 
ipated producdon. In addition to Bush 



unotil [i.e. lot usell alier our primer, 
the interim government of Iraq was 
forced to accept a condiiion.il loan

that Iraq end its gas subsidies, and

did it. Gasoline prices are increas- 
ing ten-fold. Iraqis responded with 
riots, aggravating the growing ethnic 
hostilities and further pushing Iraq 

Maybe we just need a little more 

In a recent LA Times report, 

analysts were skeptical about any 
increase in Iraqi oil production with- 
in the year, and said it could be five to 
six years before we see pre war levels 
again. Also, Ahmad Chalabi (Bush's 
puppet) made ,i desperate power- 
play for the Oil Ministry after his 
failed attempt lo become the elected 
Prime Minister, but he was unable to 
hold onto it. The Pentagon continues 
to work for that end, and in the mean-

Not many people, especially si mien Is, cm claim to be hardcore

section or the "Tar Pit" as il was once called, (here is a group of 

Banter' each week knows a little about the section and how it has 
lost it's luster. The disbandmenl of Mastodons in Action and the

transgressions. 

But this past Sunday, no support ivas given to those students yet 
again, even while they were at their spirited best. 

At one point on Sunday, one of Fort Waynes finest came up to 
several students in the section and had die gull to tell them to be 
only positive or they would he removed trom the building. 

I'm sorry, but how is that right or even legal? 

It's like saying "how dare you he a true fan, we don't need any of

even Mogwai themselves have 
helped bring this form of music

pride, and fantastic results. 

The majority of post-rock 
is instrumental, with very 
little contribution from vocals. 
In fact, Mogwai's new disc 
features only three tracks that 
display vocals. In addition (o

award will go to Ledger for the 
simple fact that the film created 
such a stir. That's usually the 
way it happens. Hollywood's 



Night, and Good Luck" and 
Steven Spielberg for "Munich." 
As Spielberg's a veteran of the 
Oscars {he's won three already, 
but has been nominated a local 
of nine times), he has a slight 
advantage over the others, who 

him being victorious this year. 
I'm betting Lee will have that 
honor — even though Haggis 
should get it. Fear not: I'm 
almost done babbling. There 
are only three other categories 









amount of preparation to ready 
himself to play the Man in 
Black. And he brought him 
back to life incredibly well. 



Best Adapted Screenplay, Best 
Original Screenplay, and — the 
piece de resistance — Best 
Motion Picture of the Year. 
Before you know, the agony will 
be over.

that has been already v 
(and there was a rash of those 
this year). And the r 



close one in my opinion. It'll 
be a tight race between Clooney 
and Gyllenhaal. Ultimately, I'm 
pretty sure that Gyllenhaal will 
take the Oscar home for the 
same reason his counterpart 
does. I have to disagree with 



Now we're up to Best 
in a Leading Role. And the 

Dench for "Mrs, Henderson 
Presents," Felicity Huffman 
for "Transamerica," Keira 
Knightley (ha!) for "Pride St 
Prejudice," Charlize Theron 
for "North Country" and Reese 
Witherspoon for "Walk the 
Line." Again, a super close 

Knightley thing). I really want 



I'm guessing Wiilierspoon's 
going to get that honor, which 
isn't a horrible disgrace; she 
did very well. But Huffman, 
like Giamatti, needs to be 
inducted into the Oscar Hall 
of Fame. Dench and Theron 
have been. Witherspoon will 
be. And Knightley, well, she's 
young; she's got time. The last 
kudos for acting is Best Actress 
in a Supporting Role. And the 
nominees are: Amy Adams for 
Tunebug," Catherine Keenerfor 
"Capote," Frances McDormand 
for "North Couotry," Rachel 



Mountain " I r 



Gardner," "A'HistoryofViolence" 
and "Munich." I think this 
is a shoo-in for "Brokeback 
Mountain." As I mentioned 
in my review of the film, 
it was exceptionally well- 
written. If another piece 

disappointed. 




l this 
iry was 

one like I've never seen. Writers 
always try to make movies in 
which everyone is intertwined 
somehow, but no one has 
pulled it off as flawlessly as Paul 
Haggis and Bobby Moresco. 

Last but certainly not least 
is Best Motion Picture of 
the Year. And the nominees 
are: "Brokeback Mountain," 
"Capote," "Crash." "Good Night, 
and Good Luck" and "Munich." 
Like several others, this is a very 
well-chosen category. I agree 



direction deserves their props, 
the acting was severely lacking. 
Best Picture should go to the liim 
that is the best overall package. 
That means the writing's great, 
the acting's great, the direction 
is great, and everything else is 
stellar, too. I just don't think 
"Brokeback Mountain" had 
what it takes. (And by the way, 
where was "larhead" in these 
nominations?) 

There it is. I've just narrowed 
downthewatchiogtimeby three 
hours and forty-five minutes. 
Because what takes the movie 
people four and a half hours 
to do. I did in a little over 1.200 
words! Bur I am, by no means, 
suggesting you don't watch [his 
Sunday at 8 o'clock on ABC. It'll 
still be a great time. You'll just 
be ahead of the game.
