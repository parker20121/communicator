CIA's training program. 

He resigned from the CIA in 1969 after direct-

IPFW's recycling program keeps campus clean 



By Jay Anderson 
SlafT Writer 

While Fon Wayne's recychng 
program is in the dumps, 
Purdue's new program is flour- 
ishing, 

On March 13. 1990. a recy- 
cling project was initiated by the 
Student Senate, The Biology 
Club and a number of individu- 
als to get rid of the targe quanti- 
ty of waste paper used by the 
university. 

Over two years later, the small 



project has become a campus 
wide cause, When the project 
was started, seven containers 
were placed in high use paper 
areas. 

Now, seventeen containers are 
placed throughout IPFW, with at 
least one container in each 
building, according to propeny 
manager Nancy Grote, 

"Indiana Fiber Recycling sup- 
plies the blue containers at a 
cost of S103 per bin each 
month." Grote said. "A four dol- 



lar lipping fee is charged each 
month for every bin." 



"Anything that does not go 
into the land/ill is a sav- 
ings to all of us and our 
earth," 
'Nancy Grote 



According to Grote, the recy- 
cling of mixed paper outweighs 



Ihc cost of the bins. 

"Anything that does noi go 
into the landfill is a savings to 
all of us and our earth," said 
Grote. 

Success in recycling is just a 
matter of putting forth an effort, 
according to Grote, 

"I diink the recycling has been 
very successful," she said. "The 
bins cannot be dose enough for 
some people and I think every- 
one needs to make a concentrat- 
ed effort 10 rayclc everyday," 



Senior Heather Dcsomcr 
agrees that the recycling has 
been successful. 

"From what I've seen, Ihe 
containers seem to always be 
full, so I think it grabs the stu- 
dents attention." Desomer said, 

Dcsomcr noted that she recy- 
cles boUi at home and at IPFW, 

"When I'm here at school I 
recycle paper, but at home, 1 do 
newspapers and aluminum 
cans," Dcsomcr said.

Thief nabs equipment 
in $3,000 theater heist 



By J. William Richardson 
Copy Editor 

Thieves hit ihe IPFW campus once 
again last Wednesday, this time striking 
Ihe construction site of the new theater. 

According to Lauren DcnHartog, the 
chief of the department of police and 
safety, a mixing console intended for the 
main theater was stolen from the con- 
struction site in the early morning hours 
of Oct 7. 

The console was valued 
at $3000 according to the 
police report on the inci- 
dent, "The theft is under 
investigation," said 
DenHanog, 

According to Bob 
Springer of Electrical 
Systems Company, a Fort 
Wayne company responsi- 
ble for purchasing and 
installing the console, the 
device was custom-ordered 
and took six months to acquire, 

"I don't think this will halt construc- 
tion." said Springer, "But now wc can't 
complete the sound system until we get a 
new console," 

Steven Sahutorc, the chair of the theater 
department, said that the theft will hot 
interfere in the scheduled opening of the 
building's ofTices and classrooms. 

Sanaiore said that he is confident that it 
won't derail the first event in dtc dieater, 
the benefit production "Claire Bloom," 
which is sbled for April. 

"The theft is clearly an incredible nui- 
sance." said Sarraiore. "My assumption is 
that the mixing console will be replaced 
by insurance funds." 




DenHartog asked that students with 

information regarding this or any other 

crimes contact the department. 
"Anything you see, no matter how 

slight, give us a call." said DenHartog. 

Quarterly report released 
The department of police and safety 

released its quarterly crime report 

detailing criminal activity on the IPFW 

campus. 

Theft of personal property 
(19 reports) and auto acci- 
dents (10) topped the list of 
reported incidents according 
to the statistics compiled 
from July through Sept. 
The report, which is avail- 
able in the police and safety 
ofTicc in the Physical Plant 
building, also contains 
details about the police 
force and information 
regarding the campus emer- 
gency phono system, 

Safety week continues 

Safety Awareness Week, the coopera- 
tive venture of the police and several 
other campus organizations, has been to 
this point very successful, according to 
DenHanog, The action continues through 
Friday. 

SAB's fun flicks at the Walb Memorial 
Union continue until 4:00 p.m. today 
while the Fort Wayne police crime pre- 
vention display in Ketiler Hall will be 
open until S:00 today and from 10:00 
until 5:00 tomorrow. 
Also on campus this week arc the crash 
test dummies, Vincc and Larry, These 
safety belt advocates will be making 
appearances on campus today and Friday. 



IPFW faculty senate 
seeks financial freedom 



By Jim Walker 
E:dilor In Chief 

IPFW's faculty and adminis- 
tmtion say this school is ready 
to grow up. 

Last week [he IPFW faculty 
senate passed a resolution ask- 
ing for fiscal autonomy, The 
school's finances arc currently 
controlled by Purdue University, 

Faculty senate members and 
administrators agree that IPFW 
should control its own budget. 

"At this point we have 12,000 
students and over 300 faculty 
members. This is a dynamic 
economic area and this campus 
is adult enough to take care 
of its own financial planning," 
noted Michael Downs, a 



political science professor and 
chairman of the faculty senate 
committee that made the rec- 
ommendation. 

Downs said IPFW's faculty 
and administration are often 
unhappy with the way Purdue 
disperses funding here, 

"We've run into difficulties in 
the past," Downs said. "The 
high priority for Purdue is 
research. The budget priorities 
they have for us often don't 
match what we want." 

Ed. note: An in-depth story 
on Ihe faculty senate's resolu- 
tion and steps lo finaDclal 
independence will appear next 
week. 



Student discount cards 
on hold, coming soon 



By Sarab Jakacky 
Chief Reporter 

Student Senate is now pursu- 
ing special discount cards to use 
at area businesses. 

According to Elbcn Webster. 
vice president of student legisla- 
tion, the new cards will be used 
to obtain discounts at special 
area businesses instead of the 
regular student services cord. 

An advantage of the discount 
cards is the businesses offering 
student discounts will be adver- 
tised on the card itself. Webster 
said this will be a more conve- 
nient and effective way to let 
students know where they can 



receive discounts. 

Webster said he is not sure 
when the discount cords will be 
available for use because there 
have been several set backs. 
TNvo of the retailers went out of 
business, and die person work- 
ing on the cards was burned in a 
fire. However. University Press 
International, the company pro- 
ducing die cards, said IPFW is a 
priority. 

Until the discount cards are 
completed, students can pick up 
a book listing participating 
retailers in Walb Memorial 
Union, and can use their student 
services card for discounts. 



Library funds appropriated 
to help make Helmke better 



By Sarah Jakacky 
Chief Reporter 

Students and faculty are upset 
with Helmke Library's lack of 
resources. Librarians are 
stressed over limited funding. 
But soludons are in the works. 

The library debate even 
prompted an anonymous letter 
to The Communicator staling 
Helmke Library receives an 
exorbitant amouni of money 
that is not being spent. The 
letter also noted we are too 
hasty to blame the library sviff 
for things they don't always 
control. 

Judy Violelie, assistant direc- 
tor of Helmke Library, said the 
only issue lo be discussed is 
iheir need for more funding. 

Although Helmke Library 
has a $500,000 budget, 
Violetie said they are not 
expected to spend it all. 

"Last year we had about 90 
percent of our budget left 
over. This year we will be 
spending about 70 percent on 
serials and about 30 percent on 



books," explained Violelie. 

In response to Helmke lack- 
ing in material, Violetie said 
document deliveries service 
the students efficiently, 

"What we don't have we 
back up through other sources. 
Sometimes you don't know 
what you're missing because 
you never had it," Violetie 
said. 

CurrenUy, ihe money is split 
up between each degree 
department, who are delegated 
about $300 to spend on books 
and periodicals. 

Violelie said they ask each 
department to look ai what 
they leach and what resources 
will fit in with the subject 
material. 

"They arc the experts and 
everything depends on how 
Ihcy buy books, They know 
who's good in dicir field, Wc 
don't have the luxury of buy- 
ing extra resources," explained 
Violetie. 

However, she added the 
department recommcndaiions

have a much bigger say in how 
funding is spenu 

The primary mission of ihe 
library, according to Violetie, 
is to service undergraduates 
because those materials are 
most in demand. She stressed 
Helmke is not a research 
library, and never will be. 

However. IPFW is growing 
and Violetie said the expansion 
is creating a need for more 
resources and more money. 

CurrenUy, Violetie said diey 
are in the process of charting 
what resources are used the 
mosL They plan to cancel sub- 
scriptions to periodicals that 
ore rarely used, and to update 
those used frcquendy. 

"We will.look at whal we 
have and determine what we 
need. Sure diere will be some 
good periodicals cancelled, 
and we'll keep some bad ones, 
but that's part of the process of 
making us a better library," 
said Violetie. 

Of all the materials the peri- 
odicals are used the most 
because "diey are the scholarly 
way to keep up on the topics." 
Violetie predicted that books 
will soon be on the way out 
bui, "we need books, after all 
we are a library." 

Until Helmke Library is allo- 
cated more money. Violetie 
said complaints will continue. 
They arc in competition for 
university money just like 
everyone else, and it is doubt- 
ful they will receive more stale 
money. 

She added. "I think we're an 
excellent library,"

STAFF EDITORIAL 

Perot's budget plan 
may hurt the elderly 



The debates have begun, and 
the American public is choos- 
ing sides. While the voters 
waver on iheir support of 
tycoon Ross Perot, everyone 
is "all ears" when it comes lo 
his famed economic plan. 

It's time for the voters to 
realize what the famed plan 
entails. Perot's plan aims to 
cut spending by approximate- 
ly $400 billion, partially by 
cutting Medicare and 
Medicaid by $141 billion. 

The plan is suppose to span 
a five-year period, but even 
over five years that kind of 
spending reduction could 
essentially pull the rug out 
from underneath our health 
care programs. 

For many of our elderly. 
Medicare and Medicaid are 
the main resources used to 
pay for their health care 
needs. The United States 
needs a progressive health 
care program, not a non-exis- 
tent plan parading as the sav- 
ior of the underprivileged. 

The government can't con- 
tinue 10 pay the rising costs of 
health care, Petot should be 
applauded for realizing this, 
but the spending cuts must be 
accompanied by significant 
reforms in the industry. 

As of yet, Perot hasn't come 
out with any major reforms, 
just the budget cuts. Without 
the reforms many Americans 
won't be able to afford inten- 
sive medical care, and will 
pay the price of having to 
purchase more extensive 
health insurance, which is 
already out of control. 

Voters need to think twice 
before endorsing [he cuts 
without the reforms. 

In addition to the healUi care 
cuts, Perot intends to up the 
taxes on Social Security bene- 



fits while using the Social 
Security surplus to help fight 
the deficit. 

Once again, without reforms 
this could spell trouble. With 
the increasing life-span, more 
and more people will be col- 
lecting social security. By the 
time the baby boomers hit 
retirement, the Social 
Security surplus may be des- 
perately needed. 

Many people rely on Social 
Security to help make ends 
meet. It's unfair to rob these 
retirees of this supplement 
when they've been paying for 
it for so long. 

The other candidates may 
not have belter plans. 
President George Bush's 
refusal to raise taxes, if true, 
may hurt more than a tax 
hike. And Governor Bill 
Clinton's plan has its own 
weak areas. 

But Perot's plan is not the 
ruler by which to measure 
Bush and Clinton. It is obvi- 
ous that the American public 
wants a change. However, we 
can not leap blindly behind a 
fiscal plan which could be so 
hurtful. It has taken us about 
twelve years to spend our- 
selves into this hole. 
Eliminating the debt too 
quickly could cause immea- 
surable suffering, 

Susan Dentzer, from U.S. 
News and World Repon. said, 
"Eliminating the deficit would 
be like performing surgery 
without anesthesia." 

We must lake her seriously. 
The public should seek out 
information. We need to be 
well informed before we 
make our electoral leap of 
faith. Our faith in the great 
tycoon's economic plan may 
leave us bleeding.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 



Snyder 

snubs 

students 

To the Editor: 

Did you know the circulation of 
The Communicator has increased 

slightly because people are inter- 
ested that someone Anally wrote 
that Mark Snyder ought lo slop 
writing, or be more constructive? 
I've heard students chatting in the 
halls concerning Dong's good- 
natured ribbing, and the failing 
writer with a good point. They 
are happy about iL 

Snyder ofien seems to outcast, 
through his writing, many social- 
ly varied poople. This might be 
the cnjx of his unpopularity. His 
intentions appear quite good, but 
people will not subscribe lo a per- 
son's cry of "do something." 
when he who cries is outcasting 
him. 

For instance, smokers are cooler 
than non, Nons don't sit and talk 
about important things. 
Conservatives are ignorant, and 
morally maladjusted. 

Homosexuals deserve special 
ireaimeni (not equality?). 
"Sophomoric verse" is not worth- 
while as an expression, Is poetry 
only for intellectual folk? 

There's more, obviously, but 
hopefully we all understand. Our 
jolly Santa Claus just needs a dif- 
ferent, more personable perhaps, 
approach. 

Thfld 
IPFW Student 
P,S. To Mark Snyder, Because a 
person docs not agree with or like 
your views, does not indicate they 
arc not a liberal, or that they are a 
conservative. They merely dis- 
agree or dislike. 



Outdated equipment 

Student calls library computer 'dinosaur' 



To the Editor: 

I am writing in reply to Mr. W. 
Scott Holmes' letter to the editor in 
the October 1 edition of the 
Communicator. It is obvious that 
his idea of what the Information 
Age is differs from reality He is 
correct in slating that the Helmke 
Library is doing a compeieni job of 
"keeping up" with other libraries of 
its size. I disagree in that just keep- 
ing up is not good enough. 1 say lo 
hell with mediocrity. Helmke 
Library should strive to be outstand- 
ing! We as students should demand 
iL 

The curreni system, 10, is a good 
one and does its job. Big deal. 
Most of the lime that 1 need to find 
something it is found in a periodical 
and those are not indexed on the 10. 
I see that there is a need for some 
books in a library but they are on 
their way out. You can quote me on 
that Mosi books are completely out 
of date by the time ihcy reach the 
shelves anyway. If you don't 
believe that take a look at how fast 
our textbooks are revised! Follett's 
is dependent on that fact. The 
future will sec books replaced by 
electronic media. This may seem 
far off but I can assure you it is not. 
We didn't even have Personal 
Computers twenty years ago. 

Helmke Library has a few (stress 
the word few) computers that have 
CD-ROM drives. In these drives 
are such databases as ABI Inform, 
GPO on Silver Plaiter and some 
other programs. The only one that 
was helpful to me was ABI Inform 
and it resides on an outdated PC XT 
with a 5 1/4" drive only. This may 
or may not make any sense to those 
of you who are not very familiar 
with computers so I will try lo 



expand on it. An XT is a dinosaurl 
Outdated technology! It is hard to 
explain to people that computers arc 
disposable technology. I am sure 
ihat IPFW has depreciated ihem 
long ago. so get rid of ihem already. 
It's like wailing for your dinner to 
thaw when you could Just as easily 
pop it in the microwave! Helmke 
needs more microwaves? Whew. 
I'm getting carried away. I meant 
dial they need new hardware to keep 
up with progress. I realize that' it is 
very hard to keep up with the 
advancement of computers these 
days. It's darn near impossible. 
Hence the need for vision. 
I have a vision. I have a dream. 



That's a bunch of 
spendolas. Perhaps we 
could invest a bit of that in 
our library instead of free 
pizza and non-alcoholic 
beer. 



It's a place where people can go and 
find information about anything 
they need. This place has terminals 
that can show them ihis information. 
Not tell them that they have lo go 
somewhere else or wait weeks for it. 
This place has services that offer 
instant access to thousands upon 
thousands of articles and other 
sources without ever leaving the ter- 
minals. You could find the informa- 
tion that you needed and download 
it to a floppy disk (that's a 3 1/2" 
HD floppy) and take it home to 
work on or print it out if you wanted 
to. No more copy machine, unless 



you had to find something that was 
in one of those books, Sound unre- 
alistic? Not really . . . 

Computers arc cheaper than ever. 
This is not some technological 
impossibility. There are CD-ROMs 
available that catalog and index 
most topics from hundreds of publi- 
cations. For instance Ziff-Davis 
offers a CD-ROM that indexes all 
the articles from all of their publica- 
tions as well as full text from these 
articles and abstracts. Time/Life is 
available on CD-ROM. 
Encyclopedias on CD! What a 
novel idea. Any of those at 
Helmke? NoL 

Who would pay for all of this, I 
wonder? Why not ask the students? 
1 would gladly give a portion of my 
student services fee to provide a ser- 
vice that I could really use. I think 
that others would agree with me. 
Let's sec, S30.00 limes roughly 
10,000 students, that's $300,000! 
Wow! That's a bunch of spendolas. 
Perhaps we could invest a bit of that 
in our library instead of free pizza 
and non-alcoholic beer. Gosh, I'm 
on a roll now! Back to the issue at 
hand . , . 

1 think that to be a functional insti- 
lulion Helmke needs to computerize 
more than just the card catalogs. 
The technology is there. Forget try- 
ing to plan for today, look to the 
fulure. Look at the history of the 
Information Age, The curve of 
progress is very steep. I have seen it 
happen to many individuals as well 
as companies, they buy computers 
and software with absolutely no 
plans of upgrading cither one. [)ead 
end thinking. A big waste of our 
time and money.

Snyder fighter 

Faithful reader replies, responds, retorts 



To the Editor: 

Over the past iwo years we have 
listened to ihc incessant ramblings 
of one Marie Snyder. He has con- 
stantly and wiihout relief, pcii- 
uoncd the sludcnts on this campus 
to take up arms against a mighty 
bureaucratic machine ihai cuists 
only in his mind. Wiih his latest 
IcUcr to the editor he has managed 
to show to the campus, as a whole, 
his outright inability to compose a 
letter without professional help. 

In the last leiter he complained 
that I was "ignorant" and was 
showing my "stupidity." Then as a 
rebuttal he writes a 50 cent letter 
using five dollar words. Does this 
show the signs of a man with intel- 
ligence? It has become quite obvi- 
ous that Mr. Snyder is incapable of 
writing a tetter without a thesaurus. 
a dictionary, and a book of quotes 
in hand. 1 admit that 1 am not as 
eloquent widi words as Mr. Snyder 
is, but on the other hand I feel that 
most of the student body is fully 
capable of understanding my 
views. How many people on this 
campus commonly read quotes 
from Oscar Wilde and Adlai 
Stevenson? Mr. Snyder, the only 
one around here that seems lo be 
ignorant is you, if you believe that 
this leiter fooled anyone into 
believing you possess above aver- 
age intelligence. To quote one stu- 
dent that read your article: "He 
obviously used a thesaurus on this 
letter." 

A comment on your idea of sex. 



If sex is such an intimate experi- 
ence then why did you make it 
public by distributing condoms on 
a college campus? Also how can it 
be intimate with the number of 
multiple partners and affairs seem- 
ingly running rampant in this day 
and age? I 6nd your siaiemcni to 
be completely out of relation to 
your actions. Now who is two 
faced? I personally believe thai it 
should only be shared between 
people who are married. Only then 
can it be intimate. 

Regarding your statement about 
majority You were right in stating 
that women are the majority, but I 
find the method wiih which you 
present your argument lo be scxisL 
I personally consider all women on 
equal ground wiih me. You seem 
to be making a generally derogato- 
ry staicmcni with ihc way you 
phrased your staiemenl that women 
are somehow inferior and it is up to 
the men to bring them up to our 
level. Sounds pretty sexist to me. 

I would like 10 question your 
statement about my "stupidity." 
Why do you consider me stupid? 
Is it because I say what I feel in 
common words and don't hide 
behind books diat tell me what to 
say? I admit my forte is not speak- 
ing or writing. But what I have 
said is understood. It certainly 
seemed to get your goat. 

Concerning your attendance on 
campus. If you are here from 10 
a.m. to 9 p.m. would you care lo 
explain why you were seen in 



Glenbrook Mall at 8 p.m. on Sept. 
30? You claim to be on campus but 
yet you arc routinely seen off cam- 
pus during ihe limes you claim 
you're on campus. 

Concerning your homophobia let- 
ter. 1 saw very lillle point in that 
article. You wrote a letter concern- 
ing the absence of gay rights in 
The Code of Student Rights. So? 
As far as I'm concerned they don't 
deserve rights. Homosexuality is 
immoral, unnatural, and goes 
against all the principles that ihis 
country was founded on. If it had 
been meant for men to have sex 
with men and women to have sex 
with women everyone would have 
been created with a penis and 
uterus. We weren't, so obviously 
that was not meant to be. Don't 
feed me the line about being 
trapped inside the wrong body 
either. People that believe that 
need psychological help. I for one 
am glad to see the administration 
taking a stand for what is moral 
and right. It's about time thai 
someone stood against people like 
you that obviously have no morals. 

To the senator who wrote in last 
week's issue. I would like to offer 
my apologies for insulting the pre- 
sent senate. I realize that you are 
trying your best to correct the 
screw-ups of former members such 
as Mr. Snyder, and 1 duly hope that 

you succeed.

Poor and homeless 
need student donations 

Dear Editor: 

The problems of "the homeless" 
have recently received nationwide 
alieniion, as welt as Ihe various 
opportunities to serve this popula- 
tion. The homeless exist in Fort 
Wayne and faculty, staff, and stu- 
dents of IPFW have an opportunity 
to contribute to their care. 

The Nursing Department {both 
faculty and students), in cooperation 
with the Health-Help Healthy Cities 
project, are sponsoring the second 
annual Health Fair for the poor and 
homeless in Fori Wayne. The first 
Health Fair, held last year, served 
375 persons. Even more are expect- 
ed this year. 

This non-traditional health fair 
program provides immunizations 
(tetanus, flu, and pneumonia), 
screening programs (oral, by den- 
tists, glaucoma, by ophthalmolo- 
gists, tuberculosis, blood pressure, 
anemia, and sickle cell anemia), fool 
examinations by a podiatrist, and 
HIV and syphilis testing. Abnormal 
findings are referred to the appropri- 
ate physician or community agency 

The health fair also includes infor- 
mation on social service programs 
(food stamps, homeless services in 
the area) as well as health concerns 
(cancer, health care during pregnan- 
cy). All services are provided on a 
volunteer basis. 

How can IPFW studenis, faculty 
and staff help? The Health Fair pro- 
vides a cloth shopping bag to each 
person attending, including PTC bus

Society's stereotyping 
needs to come to a halt 



YOU CAN EARN $35 



lb the Editor: 

Mike Wade. I congratulate you for 
speaking out. 1 agree entirely with 
your commentary. Please forgive 
me for being so bold as to follow 
such a concise expression, but the 
following is a bit of some of my per- 
sonal impressions. 

Discrimination is wrong — against 
anyone, I have tried very hard to 
become aware of, and prevent such 
instances in my life. I understand 
the theory which advised quotas, but 
the quotas arc out-dated, and are 
causing problems in that some peo- 
ple of minorities are relying on 
diose quotas. 

Another major problem with dis- 
crimination lies with "reverse dis- 
crimination." Some minorities sel- 
dom allow others to be politically 
correct. Some African-Americans 
are "proud to be black," some call 
one another "nigger," and it's okay 
between themselves, but not for oth- 
ers. Some African-Americans 



believe in violence against all 
whites, while others believe in 
brotherhood. The local paper 
recently discussed how one particu- 
lar faction had conduct codes con- 
cerning such things, 

I hope you find me sincere when I 
say 1 am confused. Can I ever be 
correct? Wait, there's more! 

Women deserve equal rights, and 
in the fight for them, some have also 
gone radical. Such radical factions 
leave many of us without places to 
identify ourselves with. I am pro- 
women's rights, but not feminist 
(female chauvinist pigs). Pro- 
choice, but anti-abortion. I'm a les- 
bian, but, I'm not butch nor a femi- 
nist nor do I have short hair. 

My writing rambles, but I think 
you all can read that socially, per- 
sonally, and politically, people are 
being outcast by sweeping generali- 
ties and radical factjons.

Hope you enjoyed your liltle "Fall

I spent [he cxira free lime watch- 
ing David Lynch movies over and 
over while gorging on fisifulls of 
sugary-while wedding cake. 

Did 1 gel married? You ask fool- 
ishly. No. I stole liic damned cake 
from a church reception hall while 
the stupid wedding was going on 
upstairs. 

I also spenl some time checking 
into your lousy futures. Tell you 
righl now, ihe prognosis is none too 
pleasing.

be dashed afier a freak Thigh-Mas- 
ler incidenL 

Sagittarius (Nov. 23-Dec. 21) - 
So today is ihc day for your big

Witness. 



Capricorn (Dec. 22- Jan. 19) • 
Next time you make Ihal goofy 



look, your face is going to freeze

hairy knuckles signing "John 
Smith." To find out if ihosc knuck- 
les are his. hers, yours or mine send 
S50 and a SASE to Russ Reklaw 
care of this paper, 

Pisces (Feb. 20-March 20) - Nexl 
time you go lo the mall, you will 
walk out of ihe Gap and be pulver- 
ized by a run-away Zamboni from 
hell. 

Aries (March 21-April 19) - 



You'll be sad to discover the com- 
puter voice in your new Chrysler is 
Sally Strudiers". 

Taurus (April 20-May 20)- Jusi 
when things seem lo be going your 
way, you will choke lo death on 
string cheese, 

Gemini (May 2l-June 20) - After 
a long, hard day, you wilt crawl into

Here's how love works 



By J. William Richardson 
Copy Editor 

You thought ii couldn't be done. 
You were sure that ii couldn't be 
quantified and thrown into a chart. 
You were positive ihai ihcre was 
nothing scientific about ii. 

Forget it, you scniimcnial chump. 
Who wrote iJie book of love? I did. 

After years of testing, primping 
and table-making il has finally 
arrived- Love is not an art oc a wann, 
fuzzy feeling, h's chemicals and 
cold, hard science. It's Ihc League 
Theory of Human Interaction and 
Mating and I will explain it, demon- 
strate it and make you a t&gt;eliever. 



Love works like this. 

1. Appearance can tic quantified on 
a scale from one to 100, This is a 
simple process. Cindy Crawford and 
Val Kilmer represent solid 95's, 
Rosanne Arnold and hubby Tom 
check in around ten on a good day. 
You are probably somewhere in 
between, 

2. Votuniary dating and mating will 
only occur t)Clwccn individuals with- 
in 15 points of each other on the 
appearance scale. 

3. This rule can only be subvened by 
fame, power, money and pseudo- 
talents. 



Did you miss the part about person- 
ality and relationships and all that 
gushy crap? Of course you did. This 



is science. These factors arc not 
included in the system because they 
do rK)t apply. 

Fame, power, money and pscudo- 
lalcnts explain every case where the 
main rule of ihc system fails. Why 
do college football players have 
three hoi girls on their lap at all 
times? Because they arc sweet and 
caring and treat women nicety? No. 
Fame and potential money. 

How did Donald Trump score with 
those glorious chicks in Atlantic 
City? The irifecta, baby. Fame. 
Power, Money, 

How did Mike Tyson gel the 
chicks? Other than that way, you 
sicko. Fame and money. Why do 
rock stars and professional baseball 
players have better looking girl- 
friends and wives than you? Fame, 
pseudo-talent and money. 

Pscudo-ialcnis are the other hook, 
Struggling artists, authors, musicians 
and little poets all gel more than you 
do. Why? Chicks dig struggling 
musicians alot more than struggling 
factory workers and struggling col- 
lege siudenLs. 

Find an exception to my rule, I 
dare you. 1 challenge you, I wilt 
reward you, I will give black con- 
struction-paper hearts (personally 
autographed by me) to the first five 
people that bring proven csccpiions

Get hosed at Paintball Park 



By Mary Shrock 

Features Edilor 

and 

J. William Rfchardson 

Copy Edilor 

It staried oul wilh some loggers 
who marked trees with caibon diox- 
ide powered paint guns. They start- 
ed shooting each other in the butt 

one day wiih the paini pellets, 

and a new American pasitime 
was bom. Paintball. 

"Couch potatoes arc out," 
said Mike Boeijcr, national 
amateur paintball toumameni 
director, "This interactive vir- 
tual reality is in. It's the clos- 
est people will get to hunting 
people and being hunted," 

Paintball headquencrs are 
located in an old meat pack- 
ing warehouse in New Haven. 

Players blast one another using 
guns loaded with paint pellets on an 
indoor field that spans 27, 000 
square fecL 

The object of the indoor game, 
"Capture the Hag," is to penetrate 
the opposing team's turf and take 
iheir flag. But the rub is, you must 
avoid being shot on the way. 

Bocijer said there are plans to 
open up additions to their existing 
outdoor field in the sping. 

"We're opening a prisoner of war 
camp complete with fences and 
buildings and the front section of a 
real airplane." said Boctjer. "It 
should be pretty realistic." 

According to Boetjer people com- 
ing out to play paintball vary from 
bikers to church groups, but one 
group is conspicuously abseni— stu- 
dents. 

"Il's like you're in a time capsule, 



here in Fort Wayne; it just hasn't 
caught on," Boetjer said, 

Boetjer noted that the number of 
police officers who play is sparse. 

"I've hardly seen any police in 
here. I think they're intimidated. 
They're supposed to be Mr. Tough 
Guy or something," said Bocijcr. 

Paintball Park offers urban war- 



"Il's a happenin' game. First lime I ever 
played was wilh the Allen County librar- 
ians. I got hosed." ,

barrels and other obstacles. Snipers 
abound in protective perches about 
the playing field while referees keep 
the action from getting out of con- 
trol on the ground. 

"I gel shot more when I referee 
than when I play," said Boetjer. 

Under construction on the lower 
level is a similar layout to be played 
in the spooky atmosphere of black 
light. 

The park plans to put a shon range 
battlefield on the upper level. 
"You'll just get behind your lines 
and hose it out," s^d Boetjer. 

Players are required to wear eye 
and face protection throughout the 
game and are advised to keep 



exposed skin to a minimum in ordn

cials cover the rules and Geld ques-

rales for large groups. 

According to Boetjer, there 
is a definite rush associated 
with the thrill of the hunt 

"Some people really get 
into it," said Boetjer. "They 
play ii like it's kiU or be killed. 
Sometimes they don't even 
realize thai they've bc«n shoL" 
Patrick Drumm, an assis- 
tant professor in the school of psy- 
chological sciences and a paintball 
player, can see the aggressive over- 
tones of the spCHt from a number of 
perspectives. 

"Freud may see this aggressive- 
ness as a sort of catharsis allowing 
players to vent their anger in a non- 
harmful way," said Drumm, "while 
the social -learning theory may see 
paintball as pan of a habit-forming 
cycle of aggression. The sport is 
really too young to draw any con- 
clusion about its effects. There 
haven't been any studies." 

"Like many sports there is an ele- 
ment of aggression," said Ehumm, 
"It's really not dangerous. It's a 
harmless version of the games many 
of us play in childhood."

Magic can't help corny names 



By JM Hecrsche 
Sports Editor 

So Sioiw mc. I know this is the 
second lime this scmcsicr I have 
used ihc IPFW Sports Spollighi 
column 10 complain of names of 
sport's teams, bu[ this last abuse 
could not go unanswered. 

The first round saw yours truly 
box IPFW in a comer, exposing its 
penchant for using too many varia- 
tions of Mastodon. 

Which, if you haven't looked up 



IPFW Sports 
Spotlight 



is "any of numerous extinct mam- 
mals that differ from existing ele- 
phants chiefly in the form of the 
molar teeth," according to 
Webster's Ninth Edition 
Dictionary. 

Fossil remains show this slow, 
prodding hairy creature existed a 
lot closer to Tri-State University 
than IPFW. 

Anyway, let me get back on tJie 
warpath. The latest abuse is in the 
form of a contest to select a name 
for Fort Wayne's newest sport's 
banchisc: the once proud Kenosha 
"Rvins baseball team. 

Round two sees Fort Wayne's 
baseball teiim coming out slugging, 
but my quick jabs and maneuver- 
ability arc ultimately too much, 

Ttam owner, Eric Maigenau. and 
Mike Taioian, the General 



Manager, In their Infinite wisdom, 
have nanowed their choices to 
five. The choices arc the Pioneers, 
Wizards, Kckiongas, Cavalry, or 
Sandbaggers. 

Pioneers? When Is ihc last lime 
anyone has seen a pioneer in Fon 
Wayne? TTw only pioneers I have 
seen is the green and gold Pioneer 
Seed signs lining the country roads 
marking com fields. Talk about 
field of dreams, Body shot. 

I was driving down Coldwaier 
Road yesterday and turned onto 
Coliseum Blvd., and there it was, 
Lehman Electronics, Oh, 1 get it, 
the electronic wizards. Left jab. 

Kekiongas is hard to spell and 
say and it doesn't shore a begin- 
ning consonance with Fort Wayne. 
A right hook and he stumbles. 

The only horse I remember that 
played a historical role in Fort 
Wayne is the one General Anthony 
Wayne rode into town on. We 
already have honored it, by bronz- 
ing him (it is a male) and placing 
him downtown for all to admire. 
Right, left combination. 

Hmm. a sandbagger. A pimply 
faced high school sophomore cov- 
ered in mud with snot dripping 
from his nose, while he lugs 60 
pound sandbags to hold back a 
brown, muddy river, unfit to swim, 
fish, or boat on. Or do they mean 
ihe lazy athlete that hangs back 
because they are too lazy to keep 
up with the action. Good thinking. 
Roundhouse punch and he is down 
for the counL 



Basketball news 
Mastodons plan tryouts 



By Joe Heersche 
Sports Editor 

The IPFW men's basketball team 
will hold open tr&gt;ouis on Thursday, 
October 29 from 1:30 to 3;30 pm at 
the Hilliard Gates Sports Center. 

Any full-time student in good aca- 
demic standing is eligible to partici- 
pate in the Iryout. 

Dick Doumanian, the Mastodon's 
assistant coach, said the coaching 
staff decided to hold iryouis after 
receiving at least eight to ten 
inquiries on how to tryout for the 
team. 

In the past, interested athletes were 
inviled to the first day of practice 
and esscniially went through a try- 
out at that lime. 



"If we did tryouts Lkc we have in 
previous years, our first two prac- 
tices would be just tryouts," 
Etoumanian said. 

This year the coaching staff will 
invite participants of the cryouis dial 
show the skills and attributes of a 
good player to the fir^t practice. 

"The best attributes arc good skills 
and hard work," said Etoumanian. 

However. Doumanian also points 
out dial this year's squad has eight 
returning seniors, and ten reluming 
letter winners. The team also has 
walk-on players that have been par- 
ticipating in the prc-season condi- 
tioning. These two points will make 
the Iryouis cxiremcly competitive 
for anyone interested.
