Rescue fights rock 



Music stirs controversy 



Group anti-rock 



ByCHERYLGIBSON 

"Rock music encourages nudity, free love, promiscuity, sex crimes, sodomy, 
incesl, and other sins of the flesh," said an article distributed by Pastor James 
Bachman. 

Sinners beware. 

Someone is out to save you. 

His name is Pastor James Bachman. 

He is a 38-year-old Roanoke minister who heads a newly formed group called 
RESCUE — Rock Exposure Solutions Control and Ultimate Escape. 

He means lo rescue young rock fans from the dangers of this society and 
voluntarily save their souls. 

"The purpose of RESCUE is ... to help bring under control some of the evil 
elements of the rock culture, such as immorality, drug promotion and the occult." 
They want to expose the rock culture lo the parents so (hey in turn will encourage 
their children to do other activities so they will be too busy lo go to the concerts. 
Proposed alternatives to concerts are youth groups, and sports and Christian 
music though Bachman does not sanction Christian rock. 

Bachman believes a person can't be a "Irue" Christian and be a rock listener 
because "rock music lakes you down the wrong road and you can easily be led 
astray." 

Greg Patten, the director of RESCUE and program director of WRCV, a 
Christian stalion, is also a main force behind RESCUE. 

• RESCUE wants to band together the public who wants to put an end to obscenity, 
indecency, prostitution, and controlled substances. They want these brought under 
control — a stop put to the immoral atmosphere. 

RESCUE is hoping to "muster up" several thousand families. In two weeks, 
over 100 people have joined the group, and there have been many phone calls and 
letters from private citizens and other churches. 

"When most people gel the true picture of the evil that most rock music is 
pushing theirkidsinio, they will help bring it under control. This music is forced on 
kids by peer pressure, many schools and business people without regard lo its 
immoral preoccupation with sex and drugs. Many rock performers, promoters and 
record people make off with the- big bucks and leave the youth who have been 
hooked on the music with empty wallets and a ruined characlor to go with it," said 
Bachman in a recent newsletter. 

RESCUE became concerned when the rock group AC-DC mooned the concert 
goers at a recent performance at the Coliseum. But now, with RESCUE, 
promoters and performers will be warned before their performances and arrests 
will be made by the RESCUE task force if any violations occur. 

At the Molly Hatchet concert Monday, Nov. 24, members of RESCUE attended 
the concert lo report on any 'blatant violation of the law.' according to Patten and 
Bachman. 

The members did not make any reports to the police. They were not allowed 
backstage, but they observed no obscenity violations on the front of the stage. 

The police and the Coliseum made a commitment to RESCUE the day of the 
performance, according lo Bachman. The police agreed to cooperate with them 
while at the concert. 

Bachman observed much pot smoking, but he noted that the handful of officers 
could not control all of the pot smoking, 

"Sickness-Sad-Deafening" was (he title of the news release following the con- 
cert. "For three-and-a-half hours, the performers pushed, egged and tried to drive 
the young people into a rock and roll frenzy using their gestures, screaming voices 
and ear piercing music," said Bachman in the letter. "I tried to stick itoutlosee 
what (he teens go through As of Tuesday, my hearing was still greatly impaired." 

Bachman believes "we wake up the lax Christian parents and put much energy 
into leading the teen lo the challenge of righteousness, decency and soul winning as 
the rock performers give to their degenerate purposes." 

Reverend Gene Schwenk of the Aboite Baptist Church and the former pastor of 
Roanoke Baptist Church is a member of RESCUE- He believes "as a Christian I 
don't have lo go to or listen to it (rock)," and he wonders how far we should go on 
letting society erode ilself. 

"Music is not the devil's tool. It depends on how you pick it up and use it," said 
Schwenk. The objection isn't jus! to the &gt;vords bul also to the beat of it. He agrees 
with Bachman that parents need to be informed in order to control their children. 

Schwenk's own children are not allowed lo own rock records or attend rock 
concerts. He said it was their own personal preference to listen to Christian music. 

RESCUE is run through funding from the Roanoke Baptist Church and tax free 
donations. Bachman pointed out thai RESCUE is a nondenominational 
organization, and he hopes for cooperation from all churches. 

By using the massmedia of radio, television, and newspapers, RESCUE is 
hoping (0 reach people to let them know what is really going on. They are in the 
process of publishing a manual to be sent to area churches and other groups 
around the nation. 

"After several thousand supporters are acquired, the RESCUE group will go 
after the establishment for some improved public standards which will be able to 
be enforced." Bachman said. 




Templar supports it 

By TIMOTHY J. ROSS 

Art Templar looks like many young professionals: He has short hair, a neatly 
trimmed beard and wears a conservative three-piece suit. 

The walls of his spacious office are covered with plaques and awards thanking 
him for the good things he's done. 

He even has a trophy that was accepted for him by Debby Boone. It sits on a shelf 
with several other trophies He received it in recognition for the Sunday morning 
Christian program broadcasted by his radio station. 

Templar, a born-again Christian and general manager of WXKE. is reaching out 
to area youth through his local radio stalion that has a rock formal. He believes he 
is helping young people, and he has letters thai prove It. 

Some, however, do not agree that Templar is helping anyone. 

For example, Greg Fallen, another born-agnin Christian, said Templar "feels 
his work is a ministry lo young people. To me il is sort of like, I am helping you 
out. Here, have something loeat ' and having il laced with strychnine." 

Patlen, a once prominent rock disc jockey, is now a leader in a group crusading 
for the elimination of rock concerts and rock music- 

RESCUE (Rock Exposure Solutions Control and Ultimate Escape) is headed by 
the Reverend James Bachman and Greg Patlen. 

Bachman, according lo an earlier Fori Wayne News-Senlinel article said he 
wants to free young people from the influence of the rock culture, which he said is 
preoccupied with sex and drugs. 

"The majority of rock music is inherently bad," agrees Fallen. 

The group will warn all concert promoters and rock groups that they are 
watching and will file complaints if laws are broken. RESCUE also plans to 
monitor future concerts. 

Patten claims the promoters are "generally shaken." 

Sunshine, one of the. biggest promoters in the area, was unavailable for com- 
ment. 

While Templar agrees something should be done lo improve the conditions al 
rock concerts, he does not agree&gt;wilh what he called the "vigilante tactics" that 
RESCUE is using. 

"Rock and rollers love lo be persecuted," said Templar, who feels Ihat RESCUE 
will only band rock fans together. 

Both sides seem lo agree that change is necessary, but Bachman and Fallen 
refuse lo even meel with Templar, even though Templar feels it could help. 

Police Chief Leon Wolfe has explained procedures to RESCUE and has told Ihem 
lo file their complaints through the proper channels and action will be taken. 

Wolfe believes that the question is one of morality, and he explained that police 
officers are in such a position that they can't be offended. 

"I thinkthereisonlysofar wecango with this," Wolfe said. "I wish we weren't 
even in il " 

The position of the Fort Wayne Coliseum has also been a matter of question, but 
Don Meyers, head of the coliseum was unavailable for comment. 

Arnold finds niche, 
years of pleasure 



Ruth Arnold, a sludcnl In the IPFW Department of Fine Arts since 19Z9, enjoys 
working with her hands and urlistlc lalenls. (Photo by Tim Ross) 



The First Baptist Church of Fort 
Wayne will soon display the work of 
Mrs. Ruth Loudemilij Arnold. She has 
combined her woodworking and 
melalsmithing expertise lo produce 
candelabra specially requested for the 
church pews. 

Arnold is no newcomer lo the Fori 
Wayne art community. She has Ijeen a 
student of art al the School of Fine Arts 
inlermiltently since 1929, when she 
came lo what was then the Fort Wayne 
School of Art. 

She received a scholarship to attend 
the school after she graduated from 
high school in Ohio Her original intent 
was to study dress design, bul when she 
arrived at school, she found there was 
no such course offered. Instead, she 
took advantage of the courses that were 
available, giving her the start for a 
long, productive career. 

Arnold displayed artistic talent as a 
small child, recalling an incident when 
she drew a piclure of an angel and 
Christ, which she presented to a 
minister and his wife, boarders in her 
parent's home. Arnold told the minister 
she had drawn the figures from 
memory and he replied, "II looks like 
it." in what she described as an un- 
complimenlary tone. 

She remembers that comment cut- 
ting through her, bul instead ollel ting it 
discourage her, she used it to push 
herself into developing her talent. 

Many years later, Arnold ran into 
that minister and reminded him of Ihe 
incident. He laughed, not realizing how 
much his comment had affected the 
seven-year-old Arnold so long ago. 

Arnold also developed a habit of 
making her own dolls from the clay 
found in the soil around her home. Her 
family was too poor to buy dolls and, "I 
didn't like those store dolls much 
anyway." Arnold commented. Quite 
often Arnold's mother was apt to find 
arms, legs and heads, meant for future 
assembly into dolls, baking in her oven. 
She also had to put to a stop Arnold's 
habit of culling her own hair lo adorn 
her clay doll's heads. 

Since that time, Arnold has in- 
vestigated most of the arl mediums 
available through inslrucliun at school 
and other channels She has drawn 
pastel portraits of people, similar lo 
those one sees al shopping center 
shows, worked in teller shops, held 
several positions al General Electric, 
particularly during WW 11, and became 
an engineering assistant after having 
taken courses al ITT. 

During her years as a student. Arnold 
encountered Ihe problems students of 
any era do, that of making ends meel. 
She starled school al the time of the 
slock market crash and the ensuing 
depression. 

While a student al Ihe school, Arnold 
received a scholarship Ihrough the first 
three years and finished her senior year 
supporting herself Her second year, n 



monthly S45 was given her by a donor 
and Ihe third year, she look up 
residence in Ihe arl building on Ihe 
third floor. 

At Ihat lime, she held down the job of 
firing the coal furnace, a task thai could 
keep her running up and down the stairs 
to the basement all night during the 
colder months. In return, she received 
S16 a month, room and board. 

The last year at school, Ihe 
depression worsened conditions 
everywhere, and though she still fired 
the furnace, the school could only 
provide the room in return for her 
work. She was on her own lo find her 
meals, something at which she was not 
very successful. 

She was close to starving when her 
condition was brouglit to the attention 
of a Mrs. Charles Bussing, who then 
supplied Arnold with monthly 
groceries. 

Arnold recalled another incident 
reflective of the time when a young girl, 
modeling to earn money to support her 
parents, was so hungry she fainted 
while posing. Arnold caught her, then 
stood alone in the middle of the room 
with Ihe girl in her arms and no 
assistance forthcoming. The girl was 
modeling nude, and the boys in Ihe 
class weren't going to come forward lo 
help. 

Since those days. Arnold has used her 
art talent in many ways. Now at an age 
when many people retire lo rocking 
chairs, she is in the midst of numerous 
art projects for herself and others. 
Currently, she is making jewelry with 
her melalsmithing knowledge, and she 
has drawn her husband, a lapidarist. 
into Ihe art. 

She displayed a set of miniature 
silverware made for her grand- 
daughter, a unique necklace creatively 
engineered to appear solid, bul in fact. 
It was quite flexible, a squash blossom 
necklace made for her daughter-in-law, 
and a set of eight brass goblets made 
for her son, two of which were for 
exhibit at a student art show. 

Arnold has also buill part of one of 
her homes, kitchen cabinets and many 
pieces of furniture. She is currently 
working on a set of walnut, carved 
back, cane chairs for herself. 

Special talents seem lo run in the 
family as evidenced in Arnold's proud 
mention of her son, a frequent recipient 
of her work He recently was named, 
"Outstanding Young Man of the Year," 
and is employed as an analyst for the 
Congressional Environmental 
Research Service. 

Ruth Arnold is an exceplional woman 
with talents reaching into more facels 
of arl Ihan many reali?e exist. Her 
original delcrminal ion as a child pulled 
her Ihrough many mslances that could 
have halted even' the strongest person. 
She never gave up though , and today we 
can all see the benefits of her dedication 
to art in her works.

Hamill pleases fans 



Mindy meets idol 



By STEPIIANY HOLMES 

Nineteen-seventy-six Olympic 
gold medalist Dorothy Hamill 
doesn't seem to think she's a star, 
bul Mindy Martin, 11, budding figure 
skater, is sure of it. 

Hamill, in town with the Ice 
Capadcs show, was also a gucsl on 
Channel 2i's "Morning Break," 
Surprisingly soflspoken, she 
responded to questions and com- 
ments from an audience of young Ft, 
Wayne Ice Skating Club members 
and their mothers. 

The former World Champion 
skater was plainly uncomfortable 
with the many compliments she 
received, especially when she was 
repeatedly referred to as a "star." 
She squirmed, shook her head and 
frowned each lime, rejecting such 
lavish labels I'rom the audience. 

Just to Ihe right of tlie "Morning 
Break" set is a room where guests 
wait prior to making their ap- 
pearances. It was here Ihat Mindy 
watched, wailed for, and finally 
met, Hamill. 

Mindy hopes lo skate in Olympic 
competition someday, bul figure 
skating is an expensive sport, and 
she must pay $60 a month in rink 
fees plus equipment , This is a 
hardship for Mindy and her family, 
but she frequently babysits and has 
earned as much as (40 a month 
toward her fees. 

She skates at McMlllen Ice Arena 
under the direction of skaling-pro 
Hans Lupke, who believes she 
shows the ability and desire it lakes 
lo succeed in competition. Her 
meeting with Hamill has enhanced 
that desire. 

"I skated with such energy after 
meeting her," said Mindy. "Gelling 
lo meet someone like her really 
makes you feel like working harder 
to achieve your goal. The Olympics 
seem closer now, more possible." 

Mindy also attended that 
evening's performance of the Ice 
Capades and noticed a difference 
between Hamill on ice and Hamill in 
person. 
"She's so confident on the Ice — 



the way she smiles, the way she 
moves, her speed, her energy. You 
just know she knows how really 
good she is. Bul in person, she's 
almost shy and seems embarrassed 
about her fame. It's like she feels 
she doesn't deserve it or 
something," Mindy said. "You'd 
think she'd know how important she 
is to people like me who skale." 

Hamill's importance to Mindy 
made their meeting unforgettable 
forlhe young skater. 

After "Morning Break" had 
ended, Hamill. a petite woman in 
spite of an athletic appearance on 
ice, got up and walked toward the 
room whore Mindy wailed. They 
were introduced and Hamill was 
told of Mindy's aspirations. An 
autograph was given, a whimsical 
"happy face" drawn under the 
message and signature, Tliere was 
more conversation and a suggestion 
thai Mindy and Hamill pose for a 
piclure. The two moved closer 
together and smiled al one another, 
Hamill put her arm around Mindy 
with a hug, and Ihey turned to smile 
for Ihe camera. 

Then It was time for Hamill lo 
leave, and as her group gathered 
momentum going out the door, 
someone said, "Thank you. 
Dorothy, for Ihe years of pleasure." 
Hamill stopped instantly, obviously 
pleased, and turned to earnestly 
thank the person who said il. This 
was what she wanted lo hear. Not 
the lavish compliments or the word 
"star," but the knowledge that she 
had entertained and brought 
pleasure to her fans. 

Then she was gone and Mindy was 
left with a wonderful memory and 
the rare thrill of meeting an idol. 

"Meeting her, talking lo her, and 
gelling her autograph was so much 
more than I had ever hoped for, bul 
when she put her arm around me, I 
thought I would explode with 
happiness. 1 will never forget it or 
her,"Mindy said. 

For this young skater. Dorothy 
Hamill is clearly a slar — but not 
the kind thai gets in your eyes. For 
Mindy, she's a slar lo steer by. 



Geology majors 'rock' 



By JIM CHAPMAN 

Who said thai geology majors really 
know how to rock? Well, it's true. They 
do. bul they know how lo do more Ihan 
that. 

Besides being the study of earth 
materials such as rocks, minerals and 
fossils, geology involves Ihe exploration 
for petroleum and economically im- 
portant minerals. Geology includes 
study of the internal structure of the 
earth, of earthquakes and volcanoes, 
and of other equally fascinating sub- 
jects. 

IPFW offers four-year geology B.S 
or A.B. degree programs and there are 
currently 28geology majors here. 

"It's not a popular degree program. 
although Ihe subject mailer is 
fascinating and the job opportunities 
enormous," said Dipak Chowdhury. 
chairman of the Department of Earth 
and Space Sciences. 

Chowdhury elaborated that job op- 
portunities in the geology field are so 
numerous because of Ihe search for 
petroleum and minerals that are in 
short supply 

"In geophysics, we use principles of 
physics lo determine the location of 
minerals Iwcnuse they are so far down 
in the ground," Chowdhury said. 

Between BO and 90 percent of the 
courses in geology involve field trips. 
During the spring break, for instance, a 



group of geology majors will travel lo 
Baraboo, Wis to study rock formations. 
Al Iheend of Ihe spring semester, one 
class will travel lo the Grand Canyon 
and other areas in the Rocky Moun- 
tains. Another class will travel to the 
Florida Keys lo study sediments for- 
ming under shallow marine water and 
see aspects of the marine environment 
that provide clues for Ihe interpretation 
of past environments. 

"'I think geology is a good field — a 
high-paying field, because il is a 
science of the future." said Keith 
Emrick. a senior gology major. "IP- 
FW's geology department offers things 
that other universities don't offer," 

One should have al least a master's 
degree to be a professional geologist. 
and a Ph.D. is required for leaching at 
a university. Chowdhury said. 

The geology deparlmeni contains two 
laboratory preparation rooms where 
students prepare and analyze 
geological samples ; and a paleontology 
lab, where fossils are studied is 
available. The laboratories are com- 
plemented by a rock preparation room 
where most of ihe "dirty work" is done. 
Beginning geology students learn the 
idonlificalion of rocks, minerals and 
fo.ssils. as well as Ihe elementary in- 
lerprelalion of topographic maps in the 
laboratory in introductory geology 
courses.

The Coniniunicator 



Staff thanks editor 



What is a great leader? It's a person 
who has the ability to motivate those 
around him or her to strive toward goals 
while personally maintaining a high 
level of accomplishment. 

We at The Communicator know such a 
person. She is Debbie Cantwell, our 
editor-in-chief. 

Debbie, a senior English major here, 
has served as our leader throughout the 
spring and fall semesters of 1980. Not 
only has she been a leader to her staff, 
she has also been a vital part of the 
campus leadership as a whole. 

In her position as editor-in-chief. 
Debbie is the master-planner and the 
final authority of The Communicator 
editorial operation. It is her respon- 
sibility to supervise and direct the 
creation of The Communicator from the 
conception of story ideas, through the 
iiewsgathering, storywriting and story 
editing procedures to the final lay-out 
and design. 

Debbie is also responsible for long- 
range planning and development, in- 
cluding the recruitmeni and training of 
the subordinate editors and staff 
writers. 

As editor-in-chief, she familiarized 
lierself thoroughly with all aspects of 
IPFW, Indiana and Purdue universities 
systems, and of all areas of Indiana 
government concerned with higher 
education. 

As the representative of The Com- 
municator within the IPFW campus 
commimity, Debbie became personally 
acquainted with and established 



.working relationships with all universitv 
decision makers, as well as with those 
who influence the decision makers. 

All these things Debbie Cantwell has 
done well. 

As Debbie leaves The Communicator 
staff at the end of this semester to 
complete her degree work, we want to 
say "Thanks, Debbie."

Moral 

Majority 

oppressive 

By STEPHANY HOLMES 

The voting machines had 
tiarely cooled after Ihc Nov 
4 election when members of 
Moral Majority were served 
notice: Moral Majorily is 
NOT going 10 run the show 
and theocracy will not rule 
Ihc nation 

Dan Quayle, senator -elect, 
has already said several 
limes that recent Republican 
victories were not a result of 
Moral Majority efforts. On 
the "Today" show, he said, 
"I believe two grotips are 
going to be disappointed with 
the new governmenl, the Old 
l^fland the New Right." 

President-elect Ronald 
Reagan, after being urged 
by Fundamentalist religious 
groups to ignore pro-ERA, 
pro-choice vice-president- 
elect George Bush for the 
next four years, said, "we'll 
be working very closely 
together " 

Then Moral Majorily 
issued an ultimatum con- 
cerning the upcoming Senate 
Majorily Leader position, 
saying thai Howard Baker, 
R, Tenn.. absolutely would 
not do. Reagan, when 
questioned about the 
potential conflict, said Uiere 
was NO conflict and Howard 
Baker would do very well, 
thank you. 

Hmmmmmmm, We may 
be spared Ihe reappearance 
of the pillory after all. Right 
wing religious groups will 
not be ignored and we do 
have a very conservative 
governmenl coming to 
power, but it seems it will not 
bloom into the near 
theocracy Moral Majority 
types had hoped for. 

Thank God. 

Religious-oriented politics 
often lead to religious- 
oriented government— the 
shortest route to oppression 
known to mankind. Woe be 
unto those whose l^liefs 
don't coincide with those in 
power. 

That is why Ihe foundersof 
this country wisely sought to 
separate church and stale, 
keeping government out of

religion AND religion out of 
government. 

The new religious right 
defends what I believe are 
unconstitutional activities 
by pointing to past politioal 
involvement of more liberal 
Christian leadership. Why 
are we now protesting when 
the conservatives get in the 
act, they ask. 

For me. the difference is 
this: 1 am accustomed to a 
Christian ministry 

promoting world peace, 
charily for the poor, 
tolerance of human failings, 
and love of fellow man. I feel 
this is not political, but ex- 
pected, and a part of 
Christian advocacy and 
duty. These leaders did not 
try to use their positions to 
personally sway their flocks, 
and I don't think you would 
find even one hawking their 
philosophical wares on T.V., 
trying to amass a fortune in 
the process. 

Then there is Moral 
Majorily and company. 
Their slogan seems lo be a 
vicious "Let's get 'em!" 
Their prey included liberal 
senators, homosexuals, 
believers in pro-choice, 
feminists, minorities, the 
poor and anyone else who 
doesn't agree with them. 
And of course, any old 
means can be used to justify 
Christian ends, right? 

The New Right actually 
preaches the politics of hale, 
bigotry and repression, and 
attempts to wrap it up in a 
so-called Christian wrapper 
to make it appear more 
palatable. 

They worked tirelessly to 
tie in a position lo control and 
manipulate the outcome of 
an election, and create an 
atmosphere where their 
beliefs could be imposed on 
the nation. 



Yet they claim they do not 
want an official stale 
religion. After all, it is un- 
constitutional What dif- 
ference does it make if we 
have a stale religion or 
simply legislate the beliefs 
of a particular faith into 
law? 

I believe the function of 
law is to protect and keep 
order in a society and not to 
set its moral standards. 
Despite the claims of Moral 
Majority, we are not a 
Christian nation. We are a 
democratic nation, and 
because of our democracy, 
we have the individual option 
of being Christian— or 
whatever. 

Religion freely chosen can 
enhance life. Repressive 
religion rammed down the 
throats of the people can 
start a revolution.

Forensicators visit Nowhere 

Five women from the 
, IPFW Forensic League took 
a mind-expanding trip on 
Nov. 21 lo Sieve Martin's 
favorite spot, Nowhere, 
USA. (Terre Haute). 

The success of Dr. Jan 
Roncelli's coercive tactics 
resulted in five students 
parading 15 pieces of 
literature before hard-core 
interpretive critics at 
Indiana State University. 
The stalwart team soon 
warmed the hearts and 
minds of millions, well, 
maybe 100 kindred souls with 
interpretations of poetry, 
proseanddrama. 

Exhausted after such a 
cognitive experience, the 
team sought solace at the 
ISU lodge. After a short. 



unplanned side trip lo the 
local monastery. Fort 
Wayne students mingled 
with others from eight 
states. 

Surviving accom- 

modations fondly referred 
to as the "roach motel, "the 
intrepid interpreters at- 
tended workshops 
and more readines 
on Saturday. These re- 
sulted in the nomination of 
Becky Niccum and Nancy 
Korn for Che final reading 
session. Four hundred and 
forly-three miles later, the 
forensicators wearily 
returned home with visions 
of future tournament 
trophies dancing in their 
heads. 



Cards requested for hostages 



Again this year, as we 
prepare to gather with 
friends and loved ones

Cast is excellent 



bvMiciiki.f: 

DpVINNEY 

TtiL' runaway dilemma in 
America has reached 
epidemic porporlions in 
reconl years. H is not only a 
problem in itself, bul also 
serves as the result of and 
the cause of many other 
problems in the country 
today, including child and 
drug ahust', prostitution, and 
)uvi'nile delinquency, 

PIT'S production of 
"Ilunaways," a musical by 
F:iizabclh Swados. deals with 
allot these issues 

Those looking tor 
lighthcarted fun and 
whimsical amusement will 
not enjoy (his play; it's a 
grim, often brutal account of 
several runaways, their 
slories. and their slruggles 



lo survive, 

Unfortunately, most 
people arc aware of the 
situation but have heard so 
many statistics that they've 
lost sight of the humanity 
involved. 

"Runaways" represents 
that humanity with com- 
passion and gripping 
realism, U may not be a 
brightly entertaining play, 
bul it's an important one. 

Overall, PIT'S production 
is highly commendable. The 
cast is excellent, and they 
work beautifully as an en- 
semble. To single out in- 
dividuals would be unfair; 
each has his moment lo shine 
and to contribute greatly to 
the impact of the show. 

Musically, the second act 
was strongest, although both 



acts had some very good 
numbers. All of the voices 
were strong, and the blend 
was superb. 

However, it was not 
without flaws. The volume 
throughout the play was 
excessive, and some of the 
explicilness wasn 'I 
necessary to make the point. 
While both may be totally 
realistic, they tend to 
distract from rather than 
enhance the concept. 

In fact, the most powerful 
moment was one of the 
quietest. The segment, "I 
Went Back Home," from the 
First act was both touching 
and horrifying. It brought 
home the message of the 
play beautifully, and it's that 
message that makes this 
play worth seeing. 



ByMlKEGp:FFEN 
II was two-and-a-half 

hours of pure joy when jazz 
pianist Billy Taylor joined 
conductor Ronald Ondreijka 
and the Fori Wayne 
Philharmonic for a special 
pops concert Saturday nighi 
al the Embassy Theatre. 

The standard for the 
ovening was set in the 
middle of the Philharmonic's 
opening set. Its rendition of 
Mendelssohn's "Hebrides 
Overture" was excellent and 
showed off the string section 
to good advantage. Despite 
the nondescript nature of the 
two tunes surrounding this 
piece. Gold's "Boston Pops 
March" and Gould's "Three 
American Ballads." two 
predictable tunes in- 
lerweaved by hackneyed 
themes of Americana, the 
orchestra made a tough act 
for Billy Taylor lo follow. 

He succeeded in glowing 
fashion, Taylor is a master 
of the jazz piano and a 
prolific composer He has 
written over 200 com- 
positions, including the score 
for the popular Broadway 
hit, "Your Arm's Too Short 
to Box With God." He has 
played with such jazz 
giants as Dizzy Gillespie, 



Duke Ellington and Charhe 
Parker He can currently be 
heard on Wl PU as the host of 
National Public Radio's 
"Jazz Alive." 

Taylor's diverse talents 
were apparent during his 
compositions, "Impromptu" 
and "Suite for Jazz Piano 
and Orchestra" Both pieces 
deftly showed how good 
classical jazz can be, with 
neither element over- 
powering the other. The 
"Suite." a work com- 
missioned by the Utah 
Symphony, provided a 
superb showcase for Taylor 
as he whirled into an 
amazing cadenza, his hands 
moving over the keyboard 
with lightning speed. The 
number also showed off the 
talents of bassisi Victor 
Gaskln and drummer Keith 
Opeland, each of whom had 
marvelous solos. 

The evening really shifted 
into high gear after the 
Philharmonic left the stage 
and Taylor and his men 
played some tunes. Their 
songs proved that jazz 
needn't be an endless array 
of one-note variations of the 
same theme. The trio 
showed the wide possibilities 



inherent in jazz. Their set 
was a study in contrasts, The 
smooth melodic tones of 
Richard Rogers' "My 
Romance" were contrasted 
with the hard driving edge of 
"N.C.AG." Spiritual and 
Gospel styles were con- 
trasted with "Spiritual" and 
"I Wish I Knew How It Felt 
to Be Free," All of Ihese 
numbers , showed the vir- 
tuosityof the trio. 

The highlight of the 
evening came at the very 
end when the trio performed 
a Duke Ellington medley. 
Their combination of 
"Caravan" and "Satin Doll" 
was unique and contained 
some of the best, most for- 
ceful jazz I've heard in 
years. Their rendition of 
"Satin Doll" in particular, 
would have made Duke 
proud. 

The combination of Billy 
Taylor and the Philharmonic 
provided an evening of great 
musical entertainment. The 
audience loved it and gave 
Taylor three standing 
ovations during the course of 
the evening. The concert was 
enough to make the audience 
want Billy Taylor to return 
lo Fort Wayne soon. 




'The Wiz^ has flaws 



ByMIKEGEFFEN 
Easing on down Ihe road 
can he a l»umpy trip as The 
Modern Dance Company of 
Manhattan's production of 
"The Wiz" proved when it 
played the Embassy on 
Saturday. Nov. 22. 

Director-choreographer 
Stephanie L, Terry's version 
of Ihe Broadway hil had a 
few fundamental flaws, but 
Ihe production was saved 
because of Ihe exhilarailh^'" 
musical numbers. The 
dancingwas nicely done, and 
it kept the show from getting 
bogged down. 

Charlie Smalls' score was 
exuberant, Tlie score had a 
variety of musical styles that 
set feel moving There was 
so much joy involved in the 
music. It was hard nol tofeel 
it The material was simply 
so strong that anyone with a 



good voice could make it 

work. 

Songs like "Ease On Down 
The Road," "Slide Some Oil 
To Me," "So You Wanted To 
Meet Ihe Wizard," "No Bad 
News,' "Y'AII Got It" and 
"Home" were all good 
numbers and could have 
been equally show stopping, 
given the right performers. 

The main flaw of the play 
; was not with the numbers, 
but the cast. The acting was 
pedestrian. The cast seemed 
to be chosen for musical 
abilities rather than acting, 
and performances suffered 
as a result. The cast never 
seemed to work together and 
establish a rapport, much 
less character development. 
The actors were fine in their 
musical numbers, bul one- 
dimensional in their acting. 

Sixteen-year-old Marline 
Girautl, as Dorothy, was too 



think american 



whiney and unconvincing, 
although she did belt out 
"Home" with an un- 
believable force. Peter M, 
Wherry, Raymond Harris, 
and Lawrence Clayton, as 
the Tinman, Scarecrow and 
Lion, were too conscious of 
reacting on cue. 

About the only one in the 
cast who generated some 
excitement in his singing and 
acting was Preston Smith as 
The Wiz. He was magnetic 
and had a nice stage 
presence. 

All in all, though, "The 
Wiz" managed lo overcome 
its faults, and it was very 
enjoyable. The actors did 
very well with the songs, and 
their exuberance made their 
acting faults minimal. "Hie 
near-capacity crowd was 
enthusiastic, if somewhat 
reserved at times. The trip 
down the yellow brick road 
was full of roadblocks, but it 
was well worth the trouble. 



Allen works dynamic 



By NICKSTANGER 

The Fort Wayne Museutn 
of Art is hosting a very 
special group of works, 
mostly acrylics and 
watercolors, by San Fran- 
cisco artist Jesse Allen, 

These dynamic paintings, 
seemingly psyehadelic upon 
first glance, are intensely 
religious, said Allen, and the 
religion is biology, 

Jesse Allen was born in 
Kenya 44 years ago. He was 
there until he was 19 when at 
about the same time, his 
interest in art was developed 
as a means of expressing 
himself in a way to leave his 
mark on the world. 

His biggest influence in 
painting was a biology 
teacher in Africa The 
teacher's impression on him - 
is still consistent today. 

His work examines man's 
relationship with nature in 
an extremely detailed style, 
the same essentially as he 
started using 16 years ago, 
portraying imaginary, 
exotic plans, plants and 
animals. 

His paintings of these 
natural impressions, at first 
priced in the hundreds and 
now selling in the thousands, 
appeal a great deal to 
^iologists. geologists. 



physicists, and doctors, who 
make up much of his 
clientele. 

After Allen's move from 
Kenya, he visited England 
and Italy briefly and then 
decided to "give the United 
States a whirl," he slated in 
a very definite British ac- 
cent. He finally settled in San 
Francisco, after discovering 
the atmosphere was ex- 
tremely appealing and 
slimulaling both physically 
(the temperature remains 
fairly constant year-round,. 
and he likes lo work when his 
hands aren't too warm or too 
cold) and menially, or 
creatively. 

Producing his art in the 
I960's in San Francisco, he 
felt many people plac^ his 
work, mistakenly, in the 
psychedelic catagory. 
Although he has had some 
psychedelic experiences, he 
doesn't attribute his style to 
them. 

Allen admits that he 
receives a great ' deal of 
stimulation from the 
vibrations and emotions that 
impregnate the air in large 
populations. 

He can remember* things 
that happened to him since 
he was five years old, and 
has always felt that 



"everything around me has 
seemed very, very 
heightened..." 

The man is very 
productive, never having 
fewer tlian four or five 
projects going at the same 
time, A beautiful piece, a 
huge painting entitled "The 
Eagle and the Hare," took 
Allen five years to complete; 
others take a week or more. 

Many of the exotic 
creatures pictured in his 
paintings have human-like 
qualities, which Allen has 
said to be from himself. On 
occasion when he needs a 
break from working, he 
looks over his "menagerie" 
of animals and plants and 
tries to get to know each one 
personally. Each one, claims 
Allen, is a separate being 
requiring intimate contact. 

Very few of his paintings, 
although about nature, 
require inspirations. All 
come from his mind and 
imagination; for every 
painting done, many more of 
these beings wait to be freed 
onto the canvas. 

The museum is now filled 
with a great number of these 
lantastic creatures. Be 
brave and enter the unique 
worldof JesseAllen. ,

ByGRETCHEN 
HOLODICK 

On Nov. 24, Molly Hatchel 
came to lown for the first 
lime since December. 1978. 
when they appeared at the 
National Guard Armory. The 
changes between the two 
appearances were almost 
too big for words. 

The Coliseum did make a 
difference of course, but the 
biggest change was in the 
band itself. The speakers 
were huge compared to those 
used in the last concert in 
1978, Not only that, but the 
distortion level was much 
lower and amazingly 
enough, the acoustics were 
excellent considering the 
Coliseum's reputation for 
poor sound. 

The group has in- 
corporated quite a visual 
show also. The lighting was 
fantastic. With every chord, 



there was a new stream of 
light with every color 
imaginable. The lights 
correlated exactly with the 
bands every movement and 
sound. Three giant murals 
were displayed around the 
stage, illustrating the band's 
Viking-like image. 

The biggest change, 
though, came in the area of 
vocals. With Danny Joe 
Brown gone, the group had to 
find a replacement fitting to 
the group's sound. In came 
Jimmy Farrar, who wasn't 
quite as gutsy, but seemingly 
an excellent choice. He did a 
fairly goodjobon some of the 
band's old numbers like 
"Dreams I'll Never See" and 
"Gator Country." Unfor- 
tunately, the rise to his usual 
smooth intonation wasn't 
quite as easy as one might 
have thought, and this 
became evident when he 



sang "Beatin The Odds," the 
title track off the new album. 

The order of the songs was 
tasteful. They kicked off the 
hour and forty-five minute 
performance with "Let The 
Good Times Roll," Directly 
after that, they went into the 
new album, and finally a 
mixture of the two. including 
"Dreams I'll Never See" and 
"Dead And Gone," a song 
about heroin addiction. 

The distance between 
Jacksonville, Fia, and Fort 
Wayne, Ind. can't be loo far, 
or so it seemed that night 
when Molly Hatchet ram- 
paged the Memorial 
Coliseum in high style. This 
is probably some of the best 
Southern Style Rock Fort 
Wayne has or will every see, 
and if rumors hold true, 
there'll be standing room 
only the next time Molly 
Hatchet comes to town.

Budget cuts 
slight gym 



By JIM CHAPMAN 

Because of a last minute 
balancing of budgets in the 
Indiana General Assembly. 
the State Budget Agency and 
the state legislature granted 
IPFW $500,000 less than the 
necessary funding needed to 
build the Health. Physical 
Education and Recreation 
Building. 

This shortage of money 
might mean an empty 
gymnasium with no lockers, 
bleachers, physical fitness 
and gymnastic equipment, 
tables and chairs, 

"If we don't get the ad- 
ditional money, we will have 
a Cadillac with no gas," said 
John P. Ulmer, dean of 
student services. 

According to Ulmer, the 
shortage is not uncommon, 
and it was not a diabolical 
scheme to cheat IPFW out of 
a complete gymnasium . 

Ulmer also mentioned that 
IPFW and the Facilities 
Planning Department of 
Purdue, West Lafayette,

were "right on target" in 
estimating the total amount 
needed to build the gym- 
nasium. 

Ulmer said the solution to 
the problem is to go right 
l)ack where IPFW started — 
to the local legislators who 
will represent this area when 
the state legislature meets in 
January. 

"We are in debt to the local 
legislators here in Fort 
Wayne," said Ulmer. 
"They're the ones that are 



responsible for getting the 
building started. " 

Since the legislators were 
very instrumental in gelling 
construction underway, the 
administrations of IPFW, 
West Lafayette, and 
Bioomington will ask them to 
seek the restoration of the 
money when they represent 
fPFW in January. 

"I am reasonably con- 
fident and optimistic that our 
request will be granted," 
said Dean Ulmer.

IPFW Tae Kwon Do 
club stresses fitness, 
supports new interest 



ByMlKEIlOLLEV 

The ancient arl of Tae 

Kwon Do can besl be 

described as lighlning East 
movemenis performed with 
exacting skill and 
judgement. Ancient forms of 
material arts are today 
being practiced not only for 
self defense, but also for 
physical filness and sports 
competition. 
Tae Kwon Do means "the 



way of list and foot 
fighting." and it says the 
hands, fists and feet are the 
only weapons used. Physical 
strength is not an important 
factor in Tae Kwon Do. 
although participants 
practice regularly to keep 
limber and agile, as these 
trails are stressed. 

Tae Kwon Do is available 
to IPFW students through 
the Tae Kwon Do club, which 



■neels Saturday and Sunday 
aflernoons in the Walb 
Memorial Union. The group, 
led by Eric Converse, 
competes in local and 
regional tournaments, 
giving individuals a chance 
to exhibit theirskills. 

Members of the IPFW Tae 
Kwon Do club tend to shun 
recognition and maintain a 
low profile in their sport, as 
do most practicers of the

knowledge 

prowess in the martial arts 
oftentimes leads to un- 
necessary and unsolicited 
confrontations. Students of 
Tae Kwon Do are taught first 
to avoid fighting, and to use 
their skill only as a last 
resort. 

There are two types of 
competition categories, Free 
Fighting and Skill 
Demonstration. Free 
Fighting is one-on-one 
competition where com- 
petitors use punch and kick 
techniques lo score points. 
Matches last one round of 
pre-set length with the 
winner being determined by 
the greatest amount of ac- 
cumulated points. 

Skill Demonstration allows 
each competitor to show 
mastery and proficiency of 
class skill. Each individual is 
evaluated by five judges who 
score the participants much 
like that m Olympic com- 
petition. 

Participants in Tae Kwon 
Do are classed according lo 
the skill they demonstrate in 
strict testing procedures. 
These classes are white, 
yellow, green, blue, red- 
brown and black. The class 
breakdowns are used to 
determining the competition 
category.

The physical fitness aspect 
of Tae Kwon Do is quite 
impressive. Participants 
work out daily, and this

New faces on women^s 
b'hall; Voisin confident 



By CHRIS PVLE 

"I have confidence in my 
players," remarked Coach 
Peggy Voisin about the 1980- 
81 IPFW women's basketball 
team. 

Unfortunately, the season 
had a slow start. Only two 
players, Karen Dircksen 
Kim Heimann returned from 
last year. Voisin encouraged 
some of her volleyball 
players to join the basketball 
team Those who joined 
from the volleyball team 
were Sue Hendricks, Amy 
Brunow, Jo Wille. Laura 
Franke and Peggy Link, To 
round out the team, there are 
five new faces: Linda 
Wilcoxsen, Cathy Kortenber, 
Clare Davich, Kathleen 
Smith, and manager Linda 
Przeniczny Smith will join 
second semester. But it 
wasn't until last Tuesday 
that the Tuskers held a 
practice with all members 
present. 

Despite the stow start. 



Voisin is very optimistic. 
"We've got people on (he 
bench thai can replace other 
players." she said. Six of the 
girls played previously, 
Hendricks, Heimann. 
Brunow, Dircksen. 

Wilcoxsen, and Smith have 
basketball experience. 

Looking ahead, Voisin 
commented about her 
players, "I anticipate Karen 
Dircksen to be the leader 
Kim Heimann is a good free 
shot shooter and she blocks 
well for her height 15'5"). 
Sue Hendricks is an all- 
round good basketball 
player. Basketball is really 
her game rather than 
volleyball. She coaches 5lh- 
and 6th-grade girls 
basketball. Clare Davage 
directs the ball around. 
Cathy Kortenber is very 
quick. Amy Brunow is one of 
our tallest players 15'9"} and 
was one of Fori Wayne's top 
senior high school basketball 



players. Laura Franke is a 
little unsure. She is presently 
our tallest player (5'10")and 
is trying to jump more, 
Peggy Link will be playing 
the outside field more. She 
also coaches 3th-and 6th- 
grade girl's basketball. Jo 
Witte is more unex- 
perienced, but she is doing a 
remarkable job picking 
things up, Kathleen Smith 
will be a help next semester. 
She excited the team when 
she walked into practice. 
Kathleen stands around 6 
fee!. The girls gel along well. 
They are very coachable." 

Voisin will receive 
coaching assistance from 
Bill Bruening. Bruening has 
watched women's basketball 
in previous years, and he 
now runs practice if Voisin 
can't be present, "It's nice to 
have an assistant coach," 
says Voisin. "He knows 
basketball and the girls get 
along with him." 



Every team has goals to 
achieve. The Tuskers have a 
few of their own. They^d like 
to belter last year's record of 
4-20, Also, the team hopes to 
win the Northern District 
competition, which IPFW 
will host February 26, 27 and 
28. The district champ and 
runner-up will go to the slate 
tourney in Anderson. 

To accomphsh these goals, 
the team is being taught the 
very basics of basketball. 
This includes terminology, 
plays, offense and defense. 
Many of the members 
haven't played competitive 
college basketball, but 
Voisin said they "have a lot 
of heart and desire," and the 
players are trying to sort out 
all the information fed to 
them. 

Fans are welcome and 
encouraged to attend games. 
This year, the Tuskers have 
an advantage; more home 
games. Attendance at games 



can be enhanced by an un- 
derstanding of some finer 
points of women's basket- 
ball. First, there are 20 
minute halves rather than 
quarters. Then, the Tuskers 
must play be a 30 second shot 
clock where they have 30 
seconds to get rid of the ball 
or shoot. The shot clock is 
used by the women's 
tjasketball teams only. 
Finally, there is no over and 
back. Surprised? Many 
people are unfamiliar with 
these rules. It is important to 
learn these rules to fully 
understand and enjoy the 
game. 

Friday, at 3 p.m. the 
Tuskers 'will open their 
season and the Sertoma Tip- 
Off Tourney with a game 
against Indiana Tech. Voisin 
anticipates the home game 
to be a win. "I think we can 
beat Tech. They (Tech) are 
big but slow."

By GARY 
BAUMGARTNER 

The 1980-81 men's 
basketball season is off to a 
somewhat dreary start as 
the Tuskers dropped three of 
their first four games. 

The cagers lost both 
games at the season opening 
Cedarville Invitational 
Tournament, but then 
twuneed back lo defeat 
Concordia before falling to 
Kalamazoo over the 
weekend. 

Head coach Ken Workman 
felt his squad "could well 
have been 3-1" after the 
opening stretch, rather than 
1-3. He felt the Tuskers 
played well at Cedarville — 
".,,for one half each 
evening." 

The Tuskers lost to host 
Cedarville in the opener. 77- 
68, and then dropped the 
consolation game with 
Kenyon College the following 
night, 72-57. 

Junior forward Rickie 
Smith led Ihe IPFW scoring 
at Cedarville as he dumped 
in 18 and then 22 points in the 
two games. Also, in the first 
game, Brian Grady led the 
Tuskers with 20 points and 
freshman Gary Rinard 
contributed 12. 



Last Tuesday, the Tuskers 
returned to their home court 
at the Concordia Theological 
Seminary to host Concordia, 
The Tuskers proved to be 
ungracious hosts as they 
defeated the Kingsmen, 102- 
64. 

Four players hit double 
figures for IPFW. Smith . 
again led all scorers with 24 
points. Rinard added 19, 
Grady, 14, and Kendall 
Murphy, 12, in the victory. 

On Saturday, the Tuskers 
fell short in their bid to 
defeat visiting Kalamazoo 
College, IPFW led at the half 
by one, 4241, but was behind 
by three at the final buzzer. 
76-73. 

Smith once again led the 
Tusker scoring with 17 

points. Rinard added 14 and 
Ron Bejrab, 10, in the losing 
cause. 

Despite the poor -start, 
Workman is encouraged. 
"Al this point last year, we 
were giving up 90 points a 
game, scoring G2," he said. 
"Now we are averaging 75 
and giving up 72 per game. 
We have reduced errors by 
lOpergame. ' 

Workman also pointed out 
the Tuskers will have a 



balanced scoring attack in 
games to come. 

Smith is currently in the 
top NCAA division III 
standings in points per game 
(20.3), rebounds (11.8) and 
field goal percentage (51 
percent). Rinard is 
averaging 13 points per 
game and Grady, 12. 

Workman agreed the 
problem in the first games 
was mostly mental. "We 
need better concentration, 
better boardwork," he said. 
"They'll come around as 
they adjust to playing 
together." 

As pointed out before the 
season, size is still a 
problem, but The Tuskers 
are playing aggressive 
under the boards and have 
thus far outrebounded their 
opponents. 

IPFW opens the Sertoma 
Tourney this Friday at 7 
p.m. against Indiana Tech. 
"Tech has to be favored for 
Ihe Sertoma," Workman 
said. "They have a scoring 
punch that won't quit and 
excellent rebounding. They 
should dominate the city." 

Also playing in the Ser- 
toma will be St. Francis and 
Concordia. The Tuskers next 
home game will be Dec. lOat 
7:30 againsi Hope College.
