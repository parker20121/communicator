However, Acting Chancellor Edward 
A. Nicholson said Monday he was not 
aware of the letter, nor had he changed 
his reporting procedures from what 
they had t&gt;een t&gt;efore August. 

"No, I wasn't aware of it (the letter 
from Beering's office) . I think it was an 
informal agreement tietween the two. 1 
have not seen a copy of that (the let- 
ter, ' said Nicholson. 

The letter sUtes, "Thanks to an 
agreement between John Ryan and me, 
and the cooperation of both the Purdue 
and Indiana University Trustees, the 
administrative arrangement at the 



joint campus in Fort Wayne has been 
greatly simplified ... As of early 
August, the lUPUFW chancellor 
reports to the Purdue president on all 
routine matters .. The new 
arrangement will streamline the 
running of the campus without 
decreasing the involvement of either 
university." 

Nicholson said examples of routine 
matters include budget, legislative, 
safety and security matters. As part of 
the duty of fiscal management, Purdue 
is already responsible for these mat- 



John Hicks, senior vice-president of 
Purdue University, said, "He 
&lt; Nicholson ) has known about the 
agreement for some time, but he wasn't 
at liberty to talk about it until a formal 
announcement had been made.' 

"This is an agreement he (Beering) 
reached with the president of lU with 
concurrence of the trustees. As far as 
we're concerned this is an agreement," 
said Hicks. 

After questioning why people are so 
concerned. Hicks said, "It is such an 
(idministrative decision that I don't 
'hink this is something the local faculty 



and townspeople need to have input 
into. It isn' t changing the local make-up 
of the campus." 

Carolyn Gutman. an lU Tnistee 
member, said as lar as she knew the 
matter was in disucssion. "No new 
fiscal agreement has tieen made to 
replace the old one," said Gutman. She 
added no agreement is official until 
approved by both boards of trustees. 

According to Hicks, a new fiscal 
agreement will be presented in a 
meeting on Sept. 17 to the lU Purdue 
Foundation. 



Senate wants input in chancellor selection 



By MICHELE SHAFFER 
Managing Editor 

Acting Chancellor Edward A. 
Nicholson addressed the topic of 
establishing a search and screen 
committee to evaluate candidates to fill 
the position of chancellor at IPFW 
Monday at the faculty senate meeting. 

In a written report, Nicholson, who 
was unable to attend the session, ex- 
plained that for the past few weeks 
there have been conflicting rumors 
about the vacancy left by former 
chancellor Joseph Giusti's resignation 
and the resultant deUberation over a 
management decision. Nicholson 
reported that in a meeting with Purdue 
University President Stephen Beering 
on Thursday, Sept. 5, Beering slated 
that "A Search and screen committee 
will be established as soon as a fiscal 
agreement is signed." 

In a telephone conversation Friday, 
Nicholson affirmed tbe decision of who 
the new chancellor would report to had 
not yet been made — to his knowledge. 
Repeating Beering's statement, 
Nicholson said. "As soon as a new 
management-fiscal agreement is 
made, they'll immediately name a 
search and screen committee. " Of- 
6clats wanted the decision made so 
potential candidates can be told to 
which president they will report. 

These statements directly contradict 
a letter from the Office of the 
President, Purdue University, that was 
dated August, 1985, and distributed to 
persons with an interest in Purdue, 
such as stale officials and newspaper 
publishers. The letter states that "As of 
early August, the lUPUFW chancellor 
reports to tbe Purdue president on all 
routine matters" Calling the fiscal 
agreement a "gentleman's 
agreement," Beering said the decision 
will "streamline the running of the 
campus without decreasing the in' 
volvement of either university." 

As reported in a related Com- 
municator story today. Nicholson said 
be was not aware this letter was 
published and thought it was probably 
just an "informal agreement." 

Memt&gt;ers of the faculty senate ex- 
pressed concerns Monday about the 
process of selecting a search and 
screen committee Faculty senate 




Slepheo Beering, president ol Purdue University and John 
Ryan, president of Indiana University, have reached an 



members wanted toknow which faculty 
member or committees have l&gt;een 
consulted about the membership 
selection for the search and screen 
committee John R. Camaghi, vice 
chancellor of financial affairs, said 
Monday no one had been questioned 
regarding membership selection. "No 
one on campus, in any capacity, has 
been consulted," Camaghi said. 

However, Nicholson said Friday that 
Beering had asked his opinion on the 
memtiership selection for the search 
and screen committee. "They've asked 
my recommendations. I suggested it be 
broadly based with representation from 
the faculty, community, alumni groups 
and students." 

Nicholson, though, was unable to 
define the exact process of chooehig a 



search and screen committee, saying, 
"I haven't been here long enough to 
know the process. The last time they 
selected one was two years before I 
came here." 

Hblorically, however, the practice 
has been that a letter from the two 
presidents be sent to campus officials 
here, requesting recommendations. 
The Administrative Council also 
recommends the faculty senate 
nominate eight names. 

In a resolution brought tiefore the 
senate Monday, the faculty senate 
members requested that Presidents 
Beering and Ryan appoint a majority of 
the committee memtiers from a faculty 
panel elected by the IPFW faculty. 
Tliey also asked that each academic 
unit be equally represented and that 



representatives of the community, 
alumni, students, administrative staff, 
and clerical and service staff be ap- 
pointed to the committee. 

Dr. Ray Pippert, professor of 
mathematical sciences and a member 
of the last search and screen com- 
mittee, said a precedent was set the last 
time in the election of a chairman for 
the committee. 

Pippert added, consistent with the 
resolution proposed Monday, there was 
a significant group of faculty from each 
institution, both Indiana and Purdue 
represented. 

Due to time Lmitations, the senate 
voted to adjourn further discussion of a 
search and screen committee until the 
Sept. 23 session. 



Beering requested to find building funds 



By MICHELE SHAFFER 

Managing Editor 

On Monday, the Fort Wayne faculty senate urged Purdue President Stephen 
Beering to continue efforts to secure state appropriations for the proposed fme arts 
building on the IPF^ campus. 

A senate document, authored by the University Resources Policy Committee, 
was presented to the faculty senate saying, "The Fort Wayne senate recognizes 
President Beering's efforts to secure state af^iropriations for the proposed fine 
arts building on the Fort Wayne campus, and asks President Beering to continue 
his efforts by making full and proper appropriations for this building a high- 
priority request to tbe legislature at the 1SS6 session. " 

John R. Camaghi, vice chancellor of fmancial affairs, said Monday he felt the 
resolution read as if tbe senate were rejecting private funding for the fine arts 
building. He said the university might limit itself in this way and feared it would 
tell thecommunitytheuniverslty is only interested in public funds. 

Camaghi. saying Beering is making every effort to secure appropriations for the 
building, moved against the resolution because be felt it was not in the best interest 
of the university. 

Dr. Hector Garcia, associate professv of fine arts, said so far he's been 
disappointed in Beering's efforts to obtain funding for the building. Garcia said 
when Beering went to Indianapolis to lobby for funds for buildings, he took ar- 
chitectural specs with him for every building except the proposed IPFW fine arts 
building. All of the buildings received full funding except for the fine arts building. 

Citing Beering's attempts at the 1885 assetnbly, Garcia said funding for IFFW's 
Sne arts building was at the tMttom of Beering's list, "If that's an indication of 
effort, I'm sorry," Garcia said. 

In a letter to the senate Monday, Acting Chancellor Edward A. Nicholson 
assured continued efforts were being made toaak the legislature for the remainder 
of tbe funds, while also seeking other outlets. 

Other senate members expressed an interest in a precedent being set by the 
legislature by requiring local and private funds to suj^tement pubhc funds to 
complete university academic buildings. 

According to an IPFW official who declined to t&gt;e named, traditionally any 



academic buildings funded by private sources tend to be funded from private 
donors who give a certain sum of money to a university to build a building in their 
name. 

Many sources for local funding of the tine arts building have said they would 
donate funds, provided the building was constiucted downtown. 

The resolution ia an attempt to obtain the remainder of the (2,5 million so the fine 
arts building can be built on this campus. 

Camaghi confirmed the precedent of partial puhUc funding of academic 
buildings. "Many classroom buildings .. were built by private funding. Why 
preclude other money?" 

Camaghi also expressed his concern over the resolution declaring the building 
as "unsafe. " "If it is 'uraafe,' how can we continue to hold classes there? Should 
we close it down today?" 

Jack D Dahl. registrar, in describing the fresent building said Monday, "It's 
not a pretty sight. They're old buildings. I can't say in my judgment, that the 
rooms are unsafe to hold class." 

However Dahl added, "rhey don't meet fire codes," Dahl ia responsible for 
IPFW's facihties inventory reporting. "We have been allowed to operate under 
codes in effect years ago," 

Dahl explained that tbe fire marshal allows the university to meet outdated, 
substandard fire codes in regards to the fme arts building downtown. "I guess we 
meet code because the &amp;re marshal doesn't close us down," Dahl said. 

Allowing the university to meet these lowered standards is done as long as the 
university shows conUnued attempts to improve tbe location's safely, such as 
adding a sprinkler anda ventilation system, as has been done within the past year. 
Dahl explained it tbe building was here on campus, tbe fire marshal wouldn't 
lower the standards. 

Dr Richard Hess, associate professor of communication and theatre said if the 
building is "unsafe" the university has a legal obligation to both the approxlmatdy 
SOOstudenIs and the faculty and staff to move out of tbe dilapidated building. 

Pressed for lime, the senate decided to postpone further tfiscussion of the fun- 
ding, until more information is provided by Nicholson at the next faculty senate 
session. Sept, 23.

Thunday, S«pL 12, 198S 



Presidents: Please listen 
to the voices of IPFW 



Now that Purdue and Indiana 
Universities have supposedly come to an 
informal agreement concerning to 
whom the new IPFW chancellor would 
report, il is time we all sit down and 
discuss appropriate measures in 
selecting a proper search and screen 
committee. 

With the onslaught of an August 
newsletter that affirmed this informal 
agreement,~Beering may have ahenated 
many people involved with Indiana 
University. Bad move, when he'll want 
their cooperation later. 

Undoubtedly, if the trustees of both 
universities formally agree that the 
rPFW chancellor will reoort solely to 
Purdue, Beering will want the love and 
cooperation of those below him. 

Professional management style 
practically dictates that Beering, in 
conjunction with Indian University 
President John Ryan, at least consider 
the recommendations of the IPFW 
faculty senate in naming a search and 
screen committee, 

Edward A. Nicholson, acting 
chancellor, has told The Communicator 
that at the appropriate time he will 
consider announcing his candidacy for 
the chancellor's position. With this 
thought in mind, it seems highly 
inappropriate and unfair that the two 
presidents would accept names that 
Nicholson gives them for search and 
screen members. Will all the other 
candidates who apply for the job get to 



hand-pick their own search and screen 
committee? 

We support the resolution brought 
forth at the Fort Wayne Senate meebng 
Monday that asked the presidents to 
appoint a majority of the members of the 
search and screen committee from a 
faculty panel elected by the IPFW 
faculty. This seems much more 
reasonable than taking suggestions from 
a few highly powerful administrators at 
IPFW. 

Beering and Ryan should also make 
sure the faculty panel equally represents 
each mstitution and each major 
academic unit. 

Don't forget the community, alumni, 
students and other IPFW staff 
members. Their voices need to be heard 
in this case too. 

It is high time that these people are 
given a chance to speak — finally. They, 
after all, will be affected by the 
recommendations the search and screen 
committee will make to the presidents. 

The situation about the fiscal 
agreement was done "secretly," so to 
speak, without consulting IPFW faculty 
or representatives at all. 

Please don't forget these people next 
time, presidents. After all, someday 
maybe you'll want something from them 
— mainly cooperation. 

They are only asking that you 
recognize their voice and stop leaving 
them in the dark.

Get rid of the puppet act 
and set us straight 



-Letters to the Editor- 



Is our current acting chancellor the 
real power behind IPFW or is the control 
coming from some power above? 

Why does the acting chancellor say he 
was not told about Purdue's takeover? 

If an agreement had been reached in 
early August, why did students, faculty 
and staff have to learn about it through 
local media a month and a half later? 

According to John Hicks, senior vice 
president of Purdue University, 
decisions on the fiscal management of 




IPFW 'shouldn't concern us because it 
doesn't affect us directly. That's 
ridiculous ! 

As long as our tuition ^iaya the 
administrators' salaries, every decision 
concerns us. The mysteries have 
continued long enough. We want 
answers, 

AH health, physical education and 
recreation courses were taken off this 
semester's schedule. Who in the present 
administration has the right and 
authority to withdraw the popular 
courses from the curriculiun without the 
input of those directly affected'' 

What effect does office location have 
on the responsibilities of an acting 
chancellor? Who paid for Nicholson's 
Labor Day weekend move into the 
chancellor's office when university 
money is so tight? Does this mean 
Nicholson intends to make it his 
permanent home? 

These are just a few of the questions 
that have surfaced around IPFW in the 
last few weeks. Faculty, staff and 
students deserve direct answers from 
whoever it is that truly possesses the 
authority around here. 

One last question to ponder ... How 
long do you think a campus can survive 
while being governed by marionettes? 



Painter upset 
over cartoon 

To the Editor: 

[ was very much 
chagrined over Linville's 
cartoon in last week'! 
Communicator. While I do 
praise his work for being a 
distinct improvement over 
the moronic scrawiings of 
those two rodents of the art 
world. Mishler and I^ang, the 
cartoon did contain some 
shortcomings in content, and 
these have made my life a 
living hell. 

First of all, it was I. John 
Gruse, the One Tr\ie Painter 
of IPFW, who painted that 
wall in the cartoon, and not 
the tubby little character 
depicted. Very few people 
realize that IPFW employs a 
full-time painter, whose sole 
duty it is to remedy (he 
garish Indignities inflicted 
upon this tortured little 
campus by certain banana- 
fingered students with 
tragically blunted sen- 
sitivities. The "Students 
Government" monstrosity in 
the cartoon was a case in 
point. It took two coats to kill 
it, and what thanks do I get? 
It is such tack of recognition

To the Editor: 

The editorial in the Aug. 29

hit the nail on 'he head. 
IPFW's standing with its 
students suffers more and 



more with each day ttte

One of the Fort Wayne

headed by Presidents John 
Ryan (lU) and Stephen

input on the future of IPFW. 

Tlie Communicator should 
fully support such a forum, 
provided every area of the

Not just student government

IPFW operating budget up 1.3 million 



By EARL SMITH 
Chief Reporter 

The IPFW operaling 
budget is about 24.3 million 
dollars this year, said John 
Carnaghi. vice-chancellor of 
linancial affairs, comftared 
to lasl year's budget of 23 
million. 

"Lasl year Ihe enrollment 
decline was greater than 
anticipated, causing income 
to be less than anticipated," 
Carnaghi said. When Ihe 
economy is bad, credit-hour 
enrollment increases, then 
decreases as economic 
conditions improve. 

In developing this year's 
ibudgel, the business office 
projected a goal for each 



department and asked them 
to determine which items 
were considered low- 
priority, Carnaghi said. 

When the amount of slate 
funding was known, some 
programs which had been 
cut from the proposed 
budget were included, said 
Carnaghi 

This year, student fees 
contributed slightly less to 
the budget, 27 percenl as 
opposed to 30 percent last 
year, Carnaghi said. 

The stale will provide 
abouL 63 percent of the 
campus income this year 
while the remaining (our 
percenl will come from 
miscellaneous sources, such 



as interest on cash reserves 
and lease income from the 

bookstore, 

Carnaghi said slate in- 
come in excess of what was 
expected was budgeted into 
five areas: 

1 Curriculum quality 
improvement — the 
keypunch equipment used by 
the computer technology 
department has t&gt;een 
replaced with inier-aclive 
equipment to reflect in- 
dustry use 

2. An enrollment 
management program has 
been started. This is a 
program to recruil persons 
into degree programs who 



are already in the work- 
place. 

3. Affirmative action — to 
attract qualified individuals 
who are either minority 
members, over 40, female, 
etc., to faculty or ad- 
ministrative positions. 

4. The replacement of part- 
time, temporary instructors 
with full-time instructors. 

5. Providing technical 
assistance programs to 
industry, such as the CAD- 
CAM Institute, 

"We were a bit disap- 
pointed in the amount of 
increase in the state's fun- 
ding of salaries," said 
Carnaghi. "but the state was 



salary areas. We hope to 
continue improving the 

instructional equipment." 
Carnaghi said he was also 
disappointed with the slate's 
partial-funding of the 
proposed fine-arts building. 
"Weare working on a means 
of funding for the balance of 
the fine arls center (cost)." 

Carnaghi listed the 
following budget amounts 
for the various IPFW schools 
^excluding funds for unfilled 
teaching positions); Arts 
and Letters. $2,348,526: 
Science and Humanities, 
$2,766,243; Engineering, 
Nursing and Technology, 
$2,000,776; professional 



Activity budget gains $8,000 this year 



By EARL SMITH 
Chief Reporter 

The IPFW Student Ac- 
livily Budget is almost $9,000 
ilarger this year due to a 
change in the fee structure. 

Before this year, only full- 
lime students were charged 
jthe activity fee. Since many 
ilPFW students attend only 
; part-time, the student senate 
recommended last spring 
thai the university change to 
a fee based on credit hours. 

At their June board 
meetings, the trustees of 
both universities approved 
an activity fee of $2,25 per 
credit hour, said John O. 
Ulmer, dean of Student 
Services. 

Based on expected 
enrollment, this fee struc- 
ture will generate $132,000 
during the 19^5-86 academic 
year. 

Since only an estimation of 
enrollment can be made 
prior to regislration, a 
reserve fund is included in 
each budget. Slightly more 
than $6,500 was left over 
from lasl year's allocation. 

Other income comes from 
the. interest on reserve funds 
and income generated by 
some of the organizations. 

This year. Students 
Government will receive 



$40,106 from the student 
activity fee. and the Student 
Union Board of Governors 
(SUBOG) will receive 
$34,000, 

Other organizations which 
will receive a portion of the 
student activity fee are 
Purdue-Indiana Theater 
($10,0001, Ihe Forensic 
League (M.OOO), the Division 
of Music (S4,000), the 
Department of Fine Arts 
($1,0001 and the Child Care 
Center ($19,000), 

The Child Care Center 
expects to serve ISO families 
this year, said Jeanie 
Kauffman, director of the 
Center. The Center is used 
bysludents, faculty and staff 
of the university and charges 
SI, SO per hour for each child. 
Ifa family has other children 
at the Center the charge is SI 
per hour 

The Center expects to 

receive $S3,000 from user 
fees. 

The SUBOG budget in- 
cludes such items as the film 
series, special lectures, 
concerts and Harbor-Arbor 

The Students Government 
budget includes the Tran- 
sitional Studies Tutoring 



Center, the Job Location 
Service and the Com- 
municator, 
The first step in 

developing the activities 
budget, said Ulmer, is ac- 



complished when the 
business office projects 
activity fee income for the 
following year. Organ- 



to submit a budget proposal, 
and other organizations are 
invited to submit proposals 
lo the Student Senate 
Allocations Committee.

the

Another major item in the 
budget is for auxiliary en- 
terprises, which exceeds 1.3 
million dollars Carnaghi 
said the copy center and the 
transportation department 
are examples of this type. 
The copy center satisfies 
campus printing needs and 
the transportation depart- 
ment rents vehicles to the 
various campus depart- 
ments and student 
organizations. Parking lot 
maintenance is also an 
auxiliary enterprise. 



Allocations Committee 

submits a proposed budget to 
the Senate for approval. The 
budget is approved by the 
Purdue Board of Trustees in 
July or August.

Tucked away in a remote 
comer of The Marketplace of 
Canterbury is the worst bar 
in town to take a friend to 
gossip over a quiet drink. 

It's not even the con- 
sumption of alcohol that 
tempts patrons lo belly-up to 
this bar, as the unsuspecting 
would quickly discover. 

Based upon the owner's 
philosophy that "Everybody 
likes lo laughl" Snickerz 
Comedy Bar ia much more 
than another local watering 
hole for the college crowd. 

Wednesday through 
Saturday nights, this sleepy 
southwest comer of The 
Marketplace is transformed 
into the hub of activity. 

"We just pack 'em inl" 
exclaimed Kevin Ferguson, 
owner and manager of 
Snickerz. 

Anyone who's watched 
that zany late night show. 
'■Night Shift," on WFFT-TV 
channel 55. has seen 
Ferguson, the host of the 
extravaganza. He delights in 
his show's new syndication

out that the reputation of

own appearance on

"Night Shift," formo-ly 
taped at Gentry's on 
Coliseum Blvd., will share

anticipates the likes of "Late

terman" veterans and Rich 
Hall, "Mr. Sniglefs" on 
HBO's "Not Necessarily The 
News," to appear at his bar 

The technical experience 
Ferguson brought from his

have expanded somewhat to

Ballou, the weatherperson at 
WPTA, Zl-Ahve. "My job is 
not as glamorous as some 
people seem to thinki" 

Ballou. a graduate of 
IPFW. holds a degree in 
secondary education. At one 
time, she mtended to be an 
English teacher "But when 
1 graduated. tJiere were no 
jobs for English teachers. 
My minor is history, but we 
know thai the coaches 
always teach that," she said. 
So, instead of teaching 
students not to dangle their 
participles, she puts her 
training to use by being 
coherent and lucid 
while much of her audience 
is brushing their collective 
teeth. 

By the time most of us are 
deciding just how late we can 
risk arriving tor that B a.m. 
class. Ballou has produced 
(he day's weather forecast 
and been "on the air" for at 



Ballou hard al work (Photo by Mark New). 



least an hour Anyone who's 
seen her on T,V. al 6 am. 
knows how perky she is that 
early in the morning. How 
can she be so happy when 
most of us are growling at 
our first cup of coffee? 

"Attitude," she says, "In 
this business, most things 
are unpredictable. You have 
tohaveasenseof humor. If a 
tape won't run the first time, 
you can't gel all upset— jusl 
try it again in five minutes." 

The fevered pilch we see al 
home isn't the initial slate ot 
the newsroom. It starts out 
sedate, then inertia takes 
over. "I can gauge how 
close we are to air time by 
thenoiseand activity level in 
the newsroom," Ballou said, 
"We're all trying to get one 
more thing done before we 
go on the air." 

When Ballou arrives at 
WPTA, she begins the 
production of her weather 
segment, "Since I'm not 
scripted," she said, "I never 
know when I'll have to wrap 
things up in a hurry or add 
information to allow for a 
time adjustment!" 

She first collects the raw 
informalion for her report. 
Her sources are the National 
Weather Service, Melrocom 
in Oklahoma City, and the 
Environmental Satellite 
Data Service, 



The next production stage 
is feeding this collection into 

the statiCHi's Colorgraphics 
computer. This system is 
used to generate the various 
maps used to illustrate 
Ballou's weather forecast. 

"Since we're a small 
station, we all wear a lot of 
hats, so there's always 
something lodo. It's busy in 
the newsroom, that's for 
sure!" she said. "When I'm 
not involved in my own 
production process, I help 
out as a production assistant 
for the news department." 
All this and still perky by 6 
a.m. iFeelinc sluMish yef) 

But hnw did Ballou acquire 
this position? Did she claw 
another woman's eyes out? 
Did you stab a man in the 
back? Did she beg and 
grovel? No. She was in the 
right place at the right time. 

The right place was

Sandoval's "peopleroids" at Artlink 



Opening the fall season at 
the Artlink Contemporary 
Artspace is the installation 
of a series of hangings by 
international artist Arturo 
Sandoval, Friday, Sep- 
tember 13, 1965. Mayor Win 
Moses will attend the 
reception to officially 
dedicate the artwork which 
was specifically created 
using Fort Wayne citizens as 
the subjects for his unique 
work of art combining 
photography and weaving. 

Central to Arturo San- 
doval's art is the boldness d 
his concepts. His 

"wovenroids" have become 
a new art form transcending 
the photographic image even 
in its freest and most liberal 
sense. Of his polaroids there 
is the statement: "I was 



aware of other artists who 
have used polaroid 
photography in their art like 
Lucas Samaras and David 
Hockney . . but I have not 
seen polaroids using the 
weaving process I feel that I 
have come up with my own 
contribution about the 
material, process and 
concept " 

During the Three Rivers 
Festival, Sandoval 
photographed the faces of 
500 couples and best friends 
for a series of collage-like 
panels, "II is my intent," 
explainedSandoval, "tolake 
these photographs and 
restructure them so that a 
single portrait is developed 
by the interweave of the 
initial two portraits." More 
than an art form, the artist 



has characterized his 
"wovenroids" as exercises 
with psychological and 
Biblical overtones l"A man 
,,, cleaves to his wife, and 
they become one flesh," 
Genesis 2:241. 

In terms of the technical 
process each set of polaroids 
u-e cut up into the size of the 
strips to be used and com- 
&gt;ined to create a 
"wovenroid," one picture 
representing the "warp" and 
the other the "weft" units. 
Deliberate changes in the 
image compositions are 
made to avoid having the 
images match exactly. 

In the 1970s Sandoval 
gained considerable at- 
tention for his giant wall 
hangings woven in. un- 
conventiwial materials such 



as battery cable, industrial 
wire and other unlikely 
sounding materials In 
LouisviUe in 19S0 Sandoval 
wove several boxes of left- 
over state fair ribbons into a 
dazzling display of 7 -by -7 
feet wall hangings. 

The public is invited to the 
reception, Friday, Sep- 
tember 13. 7:30-10:00 p.m. to 
meet the artist. Admission is 
free (o members and a 
donation of SI is requested of 
non- members. Regular 
gallery hour^ are Tuesdays 
through Fridays, 12-5 p.m. 
and Saturdays. \2-A p.m.

ByMIKEMALONEY 

Sports Editor 
Whether or not (he powers 
that be want to build a multi- 
purpose stadium on land 
currently ov/ned by IPFW, 
the student body is over- 
whelmingly in favor of such 
a project. 

The campus chapter of 
Voung Repubhcans recenUy 
conducted a poll asking 
students if they favored the 
stadium being built on 
campus or at a downtown 
location, as recimmoided 
by a committee formed by 
Mayor Win Moses Of those 
participating in the poll, 84 
percent favored the campus 
location, with 16 percent 
favoring downtown. 

Womoi responding to the 
poll favored the campus site 
86 percent to 14 percent, 
while the men also favored 
the campus, 88 percent to 12 
percent. This is an un- 
scientific poll, with a margin 
of error of plus or minus 
three percent. 

Tom Harris, president of 
the Young Repubhcans, said 
the purpose of the poll was to 
find out how the students felt 
about the project, so the 
group could help lobby for 
the majority opinion. 

"We (Uie Young 
Republicans) are trying to 
branch out and get involved 
in other aspects of the 
community," Harris said. 
"We feel this is a good issue 
to start with." 

Due to the results, Harris 
said the group will lake a 
stand favoring the campus 
location, initiating acUon to 
achieve the goal 

Although the mayor's 
committee recommended 
building the stadium 
downtown, Harris doesn't 
think that obstacle is in- 
surmountable. 

"The issue is not dead," 
Harris said. "We intend to 
show the results to the 
County Council and various 
other office holders and try 
to get their support." 

Harris is very familiar 
with this project. When the 
idea of a multi-purpose 
stadium on IPFW land fu^t 
siirfaced two years ago, be 
was president of the student 
body and had a few 
misgivings atmut it 



"1 was concerned about 
the campus giving up land, 
and not getting anything in 
return." 

"So (Student body 
representatives) proposed 
that students have first 
opportunity at any jobs 
created by the stadium. 
whether it be cleaning the 
facility or selling con- 
cessions," he said 

Another concern Harris 
had was potential parking 
problems that may arise. 

"We also asked that cars 
with IPFW parking permits 
be allowed to park free of 
charge. And, we asked that 
IPFW get the first op- 
portunity to use the stadium, 
for SUBOG concerts tor 
example, when ttie facihty is 
not t&gt;eing used for anything 
else." 

While these requests were 
tentatively agreed upon by 
the mayor's committee, no 
concrete commitment was 
made. 

While Harris agrees that 
downtown revitalization is 
important, he feels the 
stadium might cause some 
problems for the area. He 
also sees it as a potential 
political football. 

"There could be a feeling 
in the City-County Building 
that locating ttie stadium 
downtown could help get 
approval for the proposed 
statepark, or vice versa," he 
said. "We shouldn't put all of 
our apples into one bushel. 
We already have the land 
available and ready to go 
here, that's not the case 
downtown Also, there is the 
potential for tremendous 
traffic problems (downtown." 

As for the chances of the 
stadium being built on 
campus, Harris feels they 
are 50-50. "This is not a party 
issue, but one we feel we 
should get involved in, 
because It could be of 
tremendous benefit to the 
entire campus community."
