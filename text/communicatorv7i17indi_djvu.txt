The report, which lists certain recommendations to bring about a more 
reasonable distribution oi higher education monies, was warmly received by two 
local legislators, Representative Thomas Fruechtenicht and Stale Senator 
tlr.iham Richard, who promised to help distribute the Ducey report to the 

key members ol the stale legislature. Donald Schwartz, chancellor at IPFW, was 
impressed with the report, hut felt that the university .should not officially sanction 
it, and suggested that it be distributed using resources other than those of the 

university, 

Both Richards and Kueclitcnu'lil have been helpful in distributing the report. 
Only the future will reveal whether the report will result in a more favorable 
distribution ol funds to the people of Northern Indiana, but Ducey's efforts should 
be a lesson to all students at IPFW.

Are you involved? 

Involvement in the affairs of this university do bring results IPFW is, and will 
be, only as much as its faculty, students and administration make it, and it shold be 
the concern of all of us to make our campus better. 

If you are one of the persons that are active in any of the many organizations 
on campus, and actively pursue the best interests of your college, then consider 
ibis editorial a compliment to your efforts. 

If you are in the group of persons who attends classes on this campus, then 
jump in your car and escape, leaving all thoughts of IPFW behind you, then you 
probably won't lead this editorial, anyway If you do read what's written here, and 
si ill choose not to involve yourself, these few words will probably not convince you 
of the extreme pride campus activity can bring to you. 

If you are a prson who is not yet involved, yet want to be, rush over to the 
Student Union, open any door there, and shout: i want to do something for IPFW!' 
That's where you will meet a member of student's government, a member of Circle 
K, and XCil. of one of the other really involved people who hlep make this campus 
great If you've got those i-don't-feel-like-I'm-in college' blues, a trip to the Union 
will help cure you We guarantee results lh.it will make your college days great 
fun; a meaningful experience you will carry with you for the rest of your life.
