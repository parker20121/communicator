Both Berlin and Warsaw, like most

Poles live in such small apartments 
(hat 11 is customary to meet a( the 
coFfee-houses where they have more 
room tor entertaining. 

Currency was not a problem because 
of his statiii as a visiting professor from 
a Welem counb?. but the Poles' own 
currency is not "hard currency" and Is 
non-interchangeable. Possession of 
dollors or other Western currencies Is 
derinilely an advantage. There are 
special "dollar stores" or "Pewex" la 
they are called, where only hard 
currency la accepted and otherwise 
unattainable Western brandu of 
dgarelles and other spcclol items are 
available. Some of these Items are also 
available on the black market. 

In Poland, Friedman explained, 
there is usually only one brand of an 
Hem available This does not mean that 
ills an Inferior product, he emphasised, 
but merely that there Is no alternative. 



IPFW purses poached 



By BRVAN BROWN 
Staff Writer 
"More purses have been stolen on 
campus on Ihe last (wo weeks than in 
Ihe entire previous year." sold Maurice 
Shady, chlef'bf policeal IPFW. The new 
wave of campus crime is centered at 

buildings have been hlL 

Those Individuals victimiied by the 
purse snatcherls) relate a common 
story. After selling down their personal 
belongings and leaving the immediate 
area, they return lo lind their purses 
missing. No one has reported seeing the 
culpriKsl in action. The purses are 
always discarded In Ihe building — 
devoid of any money they contained. 

According to Shady, the thief or 
thieves are working the buildings at 
differing times of day, taking only 
money From the purses, and discarding 
the ransacked purses at differing 
locations Inside Ihe buildings This

Opinion 



Buildings lack 
individuality, art 



To anyone standing in front of Helmke 
Memorial Library, fPFW presents itself 
as a rather atfractive iiniversily. Well 
cared for lawns, a lovely river - and an . , ^r j(^ ^^^ Because Purdue so 



diploma mills. 
This university is entitled to a look and 
ilylc of its own. Because Purdue 



except Ihe oldest, Kettler Hall, which 
has a floot- plan guaranteed to give a 
freshman nightmares, have been built 
strictly to Purdue standards. And 
Purdue standards mean red brick. 

If our buildings are the first, and often 
most lasting, impression that a visitor 
receives from this campus, then what is 
that visitor to think except "Here is a 
small college living In the shadow of lis 
larger and more Influential 
namesakes." 

This would have been an accurate 
analysis for many years, but things have 
changed. As more and more students 
realize thai they can get a cjualily 
education without having to transfer "lo 
the campus" and the older "non- 
traditional" students play a central role 
In defining IPFW's image, then we in 
Fort Wayne become something

loney to huild must stiU 
through them. But the decisions should 
be made here, where administrators are 
sensitive lo the needs of their own people 
and aware of the particularities of their 
own situation. 

How could we change the buildings, 
which we obviously can't tear down, lo 
show the personality of this campus? 
Let's get some color on Ihe walls — 
paintings or etchings maybe to break up 
the dinginess. The oulside of Building O, 
especially, is plain, cold, and in- 
stitutional. Ivy is over-used, so how 
about rounding up some art students and 
volunteers and painting a mural? 

Buildings arc not the only obstacle in 
establishing IPFW as more than a 
satellite to Bloomington and Lafayette, 
but would mark a good beginning.
