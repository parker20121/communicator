Child Care Center offers safe, affordable alternative 



For many IPFW studcnls 
who have children. Ihe IPFIV 
Child Can; Cenler pjovidts con- 
venience^, jflordabilily and most 
of all^pcace o( mind. 

The Child Care Center is 
open 10 all children of IPFW slu- 
denls, (acully or slaf/, beginning 
with Ihe month of ihc child's 
second birlhday Ihrough ace 12. 

Children may be enrolled al 
Ihe Cenler for a maximum ol 20 
hours a week. TWs allows Ihe 
Cenler lo remain licensing 
enempl, which is important 
because full-lime licensed facili- 

kitchcn approved for lood 
preparation or hire a food serv- 
ice to provide meals. 

Eliminating Ihe need for 
food preparation helps the 
Center to keep cosis loiv for the 
students, which is one of their 



of 20 hours lor part-time care Or 
40 hours lor full-time care, 
regardless of Ihe amount of time 
that a child actually attends. 

Prices for this fall were 
raised slightly, but arc still rela- 
tively low compared to other 
preschools and day care facilities. 

Hourly rates (or regularly 
scheduled care of children of 
IPFW students are S2,a0 (or two- 
year-olds and S2.70 (or ages 
three to 12. Fees (or children of

providing the highc 
child care. 

Even though the Center is 
license exempt, they still It)' lo 
folloiv all Indiana state licensing 
procedures, including the sta^ 
to child ratio guidelines. 

The curriculum for the 
Center revolves around learning 
through play and actively 
involving the children with their 
environment. According lo the 
Center's mformationalDooklcl. 
"The goal of the IPRV Child 
Care Cenler is to provide a 
warm, loving environment 
where children (eel accepted. 

Children are separated into 
three large moms based on age 
and follow di((erenl daily rou- 
tines, which arc'prescnied to the 
parents. 

One o( the main advan- 
tages of the Center, other than 
proKimity to the campus, is that 
they bill by the hour. Most child 
care facitilics bill in increments 



"The goni of the IPFW 
Child Cure Center is to 
provide a ivann, loving 
environnieni where chil- 
dren/eel accepted, safe, 
and secure." 
—IPFW Child Care 
Center hiformatioiial 
Booklet 



Cenler also offers 

drop-in care, for S355 per hour 

(or students. 

Another benefit that sets 
the Center apart is that thev an; 
open for cvenmg hours. Most 
child care centers revolve Iheir 
billing and scheduling around 
parental work hours, but Ihe 
IPFW Center is different because 
of its (ocus on the needs ol par- 
ent/college students. 

The Center is opch from 
7:45 a.m. lo 9 p.m. Monday 
through Thursday and (rom 7:45 
a.m. to 5 p.m on Fridays. The 
Center is closed on weekends 
and during scheduled universi' 
ty vacations and any weather- 



related shutdowns. 

Children attending Ihe 
Center, even (or occasional care. 

involves (tiling out a handful of 
forms and submitting a SIO regis- 
tration fee. Children not enrolled 
by the Thursday prior to the start 
of the semester, must wait one 
week lo begin attending. 

The Cenler does not pro- 
vide infant care for several rea- 
sons: infants require a separate 
play area, which would require 
costly remodeling at the facility, 
and also. in(ant cate requires 
that there always be someone 
over age 21 in the room with the 
children. 

This would exclude Ihe use 
of many of Ihe current staff who 
are students pursuing teaching 
or early childhood degrees. "U'e 
would tike to be able to offer 
in(ant care someday, but that 
decision ultimately must be 
made by the IPFW administra- 
tion," said Lynda Place, director 
of Ihc facility since 1997. Place 
also leaches an early childhood 
class at IPFW. 

Enrollment at the Center 
has increased every year along 
with increased IPFW enroll- 
ment. Approximately 170 chil- 
dren are currently enrolled at Ihe 
Cenler, with mosl attending 
about eight to 12 hours a week. 

The Cenler measures atten- 
dance based on the number ol 
qhildcare hours scheduled each 
day. Tuesday and Thursday are 
the busiest days for the Cenler, 
with about 300 hours of child 
care scheduled on those days 
Friday is the slowest day. with 
only about 100-125 hours. 

The Child Care Center is 
located at the comer of Hobson 
and Crescent Roads, right across 
from campus. More inlormation 
about Ihe Cenler is available at 
the Admissions Office, or by 
calling the Center at 485-4187. 



International chef is first Omnibus lecturer 

Charlie Trotter kicks off lecture series this evening 



Charlie Troller started 
cooking professionally in 1982 
after graduating with a degree 
in political science from Ihe 
University of Wisconsin. At that 
time, he embarked on an 
intense (our-year period of 
work, study and travel, uidud- 
ing stints with Norman Van 
Aken, Bradley Ogden and 
Cordon Sinclair 

Trotlei lived in Chicago, 
San Francisco. Florida and 
Europe "reading every cook- 
book I could get my hands on. 
ivorking like a maniac and eat- 
ing out incessantly." 

Trotter's cuisme originates

able. A network of mon; than 90

From Ihc naturally raised

"IVoller regards recipes the way

His adept understanding 
of cultural influences and fla- 
vors from around the ivorld are

translated into his own highly 
original cuisine — a cuisine that 
is simply unparalleled.

Lipman succeeds Coufadakis as Dean of Arts 

Position represents homecoming for new dean 



Marc J, Lipmail, Ph.D., of the department of 
malhemalics and statistics at Oakland 
University, in Rochester. Mich,, was appointed as 
the new Dean o( the School of Arts and Sciences 
at IPFW this pasi summer. 

This is not Upman's first venture here at 
IPFIV, He began his academic career here in 1976 
as an assistant pro(essor in the mathematics 
department. He left Ihc university setting in 1989 
lo become a program officer for the Office of 
Naval Research, Math, Computer and 
' Information Sciences Division, in Arlington, Va, 

During his employment with the Naval 
Research Office, Lipman managed a S4 million 
discrete malhemalics program. "I was running 
research programs for Ihe Navy for eight years, 
but I missed the university setting," Lipman said. 

His desire to relurn lo academic life led 
, Lipman lo Oakland Universily in 1997, Lipman 
says Ihat he was vcr&gt;' happy at Oakland and 
wasn't looking for a higher position, but he 
heard about the dean's position here at IPFW 
and decided to apply lor it. 

■'1 have lot of affection (or IPFW; I left in 
good standing, with (riends on the (acuity. This is 
also my ivito's hometown, so this is a homecom- 



ing for both of lis.' 
Lipman etplained, 

Lipman sees the role 
of dean as thai of a listen- 
ing post and mirror. Me 
says his single biggest job 
as dean "will tie to learn 
enough about the depart- 
ments so I can be an e((ec- 
tive leader (or them," 

"I'm a mathemati- 
cian, I'm never going to 
pretend to be on expert in 
any one o( those areas, 
but 1 will be competent, 1 

want lo give the (acully the opportunity lo think 
beyond their daily work." he added. 

The School of Arts and Sciences comprises 
17 dilfcicnt departments and programs and has 
more than 150 faculty members, 

Lipman assumed his position on July 1 of 
this year. He replaced Dean Van Coufoudafcis.

Venus Asks, Mars Answers 

The Communicator answers your puzzling 
questions regarding the opposite sex 



Venus asks... 
Have you e 

relationship lh&gt;it 

Ihat you tudn'l ■ 

During the 



'cr noliced Ihal ont „ 

you hpd been involved in suddenly has probli 
ven noticed for the past 12 months? No, it's true! 
semesters of my sophomore year, 1 was i 
■ to reaftee the biili 



liuth of what was about to come. I was presented with the wonds 
"Maybe we should Just take the summer to go out and have tun 
without being lied down. I mean, we're still yaurxg, right?" And, of 
course, what choice did I have? It wasn't up (or debale. He had said 
what he wanted to do and Ihat was the end of it. 

1 have to admit, ticingon a commuter campus makes it hard to 
Imd people and even less convenient to dale. Think about how much 
cjiicr it would be to meet someone at a major university. You see the 
ume people every day at the cafeteria, your dorm and at parlies. 

But that's not the case here at IPFVV. The dating scene is very 
dilK'ient. You meet with people from your hometown, commute 
(Does that count as a dale?) and eventually break up (or the summer. 
You are smothered with the reaUzalion that this guy would be very 
present in your daily routine throughout the entire spmmer, against 
your will of course! Not a cood way lo gel over a guy, you know? 

So. now it's back to school, and what does that mean? Docs Ihat 
mean it's lime to call him back up? Are we going lo get back togeth- 
er now thai classes (and commuting) arc back in the picture? IJoes 
breaking up over the summer really qualify as a break-up? Or does 
it [list mean ihat "We're young, let's nol be tied down for a few 
months, so I can check out other chicks in bikinis?" 1 need a male's 
begins, the year-long opinion for this one! 






ncwhat monogami 



Mars 

"Ahhh-aummer. The time when all of the single females break 
out the short shorls and the tank tops, which generates Ihe same l&gt;-pc 



of effect on males that a full moon does on werewolves. Thoueh 
strategically revealing tan lines may cause some strain on any reta- 
lionship. Ihe effect may multiply it Ihe relationship is a "somewhat 
monogamous" one. 

It seems to me that the relationship may have been in some 
trouble before the barbecue season,,. and the "taking a break For sum- 
mer" deal means that your "quasi" boyfriend is ^vc^l past the 'check- 
ing out girls in bikinis stage.' (Trust me, he was doing that when you 
were still a couple.) Let me guess — 1 bet he still gives you Ihe occa- 
sional call on the iveckend 10 check up on p, huh? "This probably 
means that he's having a slow weekend. 

My advice to you is lo open up a little bit. IPFW is a major imi- 
versity and there are plenty of single people around here. And 1 
don't know Ihat seeing Ihe same people every day is necessarily a 
good thing; after all, isn't Ihat high school? 1 think that you should 
stop using your high school pals as a crutch and make some new 
friends. And, if that's nol happening — hire some. 

As (or -Loverboy," don't call him— wail and sec il he calls and 
Ihen hang up! 

To quole Chris Rock, "A man is only as faithful as his options!" 
Meaning: He's taking the summer to see if he can find what he 
would coiwider a "belter" mate. If he calls you back, then he decid- 
ed you were Ihe best, and he knows you will be waiting for his call. 
Surprise him. and don'l be! Cood luck, and I hope you didn'l wasle 
too much of your summer worrying about what he's been doing! 



Website Woes 



The IPFW websilc is nol 
what one would enpecl from a 
four-year univeraily. The layout, 
the color scheme and the articles 
pul on there are, in my opinion, 
sub-standard. Perhaps we 
should all be thankful Ihat Ihe 
school has a websile, but then 
again, what four-year university 
does nol liave a website? 

The websile should win an 
award — (or being one of the 
most ditficult ivcosites lo navi- 
gate to find b.Tsic information.

ing web introduction /ho me page 
I've ever come across (or a uni- 
versity website. 

Also, there are hardly any 

fiicturesof what the school looks 
ike. Unlike most other universi- 
ty websites I have visited, we do 
nol have a webcam/virtual 
movie of the campus lo help 
incoming students to get a feel 
for whal IPFW is really like. 

Additionally, the font used 
on the Prospective Students 
webpage is so small, it's barely 
readable. II makes me wonder if 
they were trying lo conserve 
space or energy when the page 
was being constructed. 

Some of the tools pul on the 
site, such as the .site map, are still 

problem because'the sitemap is 
usually the first place one would 
go for quick accc^ to inlorma- 
lion. Actually, it's been under 
constfMclion lor a while-please 



delete that link if Ihe page will 
not be builtl 

I have browsed Ih rough lots 
of other university websites, 
including Purdue Universilv's 
and Indiana University's. 1 do 
not want to list all of the things 
that are missing from Ihe IPFW 
websile that I have found on 
other university websites. 

We live in a lime period 
when most people access Ihe 
Internet to get quick information 
about schools. I really believe Ihat 
the appearance of websites may 
influence a student's decision 
when choosing a college, espe- 
cially for iolemational studenN I 
also think .1 isdreadhii Ih.il ^nw 
departments' webpages look bel- 
ter thnn.lire IPEW&gt;)omepage. 

Perhaps whoever-buill Ihe 
website used the KIS (Keep It 
Simple) approach. The website is 
way loo simple — so simple thai 1 
get confused each time I access it.

cemcnls. 
.ne IOC identified two rcj- 
\ for Ihc possible change. The 
Jirel is thai Ihey need lo elimi- 
nate some of- the sports that 
cease to be competitive because 
of the domination of several 



:eT Ih 
al Olyn 



Ihe 



Softball and Ihc 



be dropped fror 
Summer Olympics. 

Although the pcniathlon 
and soflball ore bolh very large 
sporls. it is Ihe possible loss of 
baseball Ihal has 'efl many peo- 
ple incensed. CoK and nigby are 



So, why arc golf and rucby 
in Ihc table for possible addi- 
ion? Who is going lo contend 
vilh Scolland, Ireland, England 
and the United Stales for medals 
ngolf? 

The ansiver is simple: 
nobody. The United States is 
going lo send Ihe likes of Tiger 
Woods and David Duval. 

And how about rugbv? 
Though 1 know lilllc about the 



Australia will dominale this sport. 

So what would the IOC 
gain from Ihis reason for con- 
Iraclian from Ihe Olympics? 

Nothing. 
. The second reason the IOC 
is lookinc lo conlracl sporls is 
perhaps the most redundant rea- 
son Ihal 1 have ever heard. IOC 
Vice President Kevin Gosper 
was quoted by the Associated 
Press as saying, "We just leally 
need sporls to deliver their best 
athletes, and baseball hasn't 
been able lo deliver." 

Wait a second. Wasn't the 
original purpose of the Olympic 
games to shoivcase the talents of 
a ma leu r athletes? 

Granted, wo have lost thai 
ideal with the many profession- 
als who now compele. bul why 
further detenorale the original 



Olympic concepts? By allowing 
pro athlcles lo compele, some 
sports such as basketball have 
become a joke. 

In 1993, when the first 
Dn;am Team compclcd, il was 
intcrosling. Now the sport of bas- 
ketball has lost the inleiesi of faiu&gt; 
and many counlnes due to the 
dominance of Ihe United States. 

Now, 1 thought that kind of 
domination was what the IOC 
wanted to eliminate. It seems to 
me that the IOC has conlradtcled 
Ihemsclves with ihe tivo reasons 
Ihey have given about ivhy to 
eliminate these ihtec sporls. 

While baseball and soflball 
have been Olympic sports for a 
shorliime— since 1992 amd 1996. 
respectively — the modem pen- 
tathlon has been a mamslav for 



The pentathlon, ivhich con- 
sists of swimming, fencing, 
shooting, horseback nding and 
running, has been an Olympic 
sport since 1912. The sport was 
an idea of Olympic Games 
founder Pierre de Couberlin. 11 
seems that ridding Ihe games of 
the pcnialhlon is just another 
attempt to break what was creat- 
ed by athletes from Jim Thorpe 
to Michael Jordan and thou- 
sands in between. 

Also considercd for eidu- 
sion were either Greco- Roman or 
freestyle wrest line; Ihree-dav 
equesbian; race walking in track 
and Tield and some rowing events. 

At an IOC meeting on 
Thursday, it was decided that 
Gieco-Roman wrestling would 
be the other sport on the chop- 
ping block 



Is it jusl me or is it prepos- 
terous lo think Ihal one of the 
three most original sports is ir 
jeopardy? Losing Greco-Roman 
wrestling would be the same as 
eliminating running or swim- 
ming from the Olympics, Greco- 
Roman wrestling has been a 
sport since the first Olympi.- 
gamcsin IS96. 

Only after Ihe November 
IOC meeting will wc know loi 
sure whal the fate of these sporls 



could it be bringing three other 
valued competitions with it? 

Or, Ls it just a strange desire 
to turn Ihe most prestigious 
games of all into nolhing more 
than a joke?

WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — 
[PU News) Kormer Purdue

alma mailer ^nd ils retire?^, even 
allcrhis own relircmenl, IS being

they dcvtiopfj a strong sfn.iL' 



loyalty and pride in the imivcrsi- 
ty." said Belly M. Nelson, dean 
of students from 1987 to 1995. 

"Through the retirees' 
work, they liavc erihanced the 
image of the university and 
many of lliem continue to con- 
tribute to Purdue's preeminence 
with Iheir lalcnls. lime and gills. 
Often Ihal is a1 the invitation of a 
Purdue department or school. 

"11 is only appropriate this 
award be named for former

Beatles tribute does not 'Come Together' 

called iribuies are released lo the general public, it becomes obvious record companies will release anything 




Every week I receive a 
steady array of horrible cds th'al 
not only make me question why 
they were n.'conied, but why the 
artists and laNils would think 1 
would wont lo lisien to them. 

Whelhcr i

their 



nd sparks little interest- 



He up-and-coming 
national act who wants some col- 
lege exposure before their big 
break, the same quality is llueaded 
bct^vcc^ them and that thread is Ihe 
fact that the n^cordings arc always, 
with no exception, repulsive. 

Having all of that in mind, I 
believed I was totally [uslified 
when 1 laughed at the latest cd in 
my mailbox, "Come Together: 
An Acappella Tribute to the 
[Jeatles," 

Having not even listened lo 
the opening track, 1 could 
already guess as lo the quality 
and conlenl of Ihe cd. Now. 1 
wish I could say that I was com- 
pletely out ol line and that I was 
proved wrong, but thai would be 

The cd was like all the oth- 
ers I have received— (ust terrible. 

First olf, Ihe cd begins with 
"Tivist and Shoul" which was 
not even a song by the Beatles, it 



lley. 

Now I am well aware of Ihe 
fad that the Beallcs made Ihe 
song most famous with Iheir ren- 
dition of the classic. Bui as a trib- 
ute lo the Beatles. 1 would eipecl 
that at least the opening track 
' ' ■ ' of a song 

probably not be as disgusting if it 
held a litlle more true lo what a 
cappella is. 

According lo Webster's 
Concise Dictionary of the 
English Language, a cappella is 
defined as "music without 
instrumental accompanimenl." 

In "Come Together: An 
Acappella Tribute lo Ihe Beatit 



Ihear 






olhat 



definition of a cappellr 

Songs like "Eight Days' a 
Week" and "I am Ihe Walrus" are 
utterly ruined because of Ihe use 
ol a synthesizer .ind drurn 
machine. These tools become as 
effective as a metronome taking 
the place of drums on a heavy 

The computerized mecha- 
rusrru that litter the album not 
only make the listener cringe 
when Ihe tools are heard in the 
album, but also hurl the listener's 
impression ol the Beatles' original. 



This album is iust one 
example as lo the garbage that 
flows by my mailbox and makes 
- wonder why these labels 
■ 'jsend me their fodder. 



and most of the time the only use 
that comes from Ihem is that the 
album becomes a cup coaster 

So, why do such albums 
even make it out of the studio? Is 
it that the production and record 
executives jusl happen to be too 
polite lo tell the artists Ihal the 
they arc nol creating something 
worthwhile? 

I think Ihal Ihis may be part 
of Ihe problem with these bad 
recordings, but I think the true 
answer lies in the lact that socie- 
ty has become so specialized that 
a whole album is recorded, pro- 
duced and distributed if there is 
a lilllebil of interest. 

Record companies want as 
big of a piece of the pie as possi- 
ble. |U5t like all other businesses, 
and in order lo gain that control, 
the companies will go lo such 
lengths to comply with Ihe pro- 
duction of an album that proba- 
bly will have very little or no 
interest from the public. 

However, that docs nol 
change the fact that I find it 
exiremely annoying that these 
horrible albums mate it to me.
