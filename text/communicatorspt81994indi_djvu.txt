Fewer students attend IPFW this year 



By S, Brant KtUey 
Newt Editor 

IPFW's enrollment is experiencing its 
first drop in several years Ihis fall, accord- 
ing to Associalc Vice Chancellor and 
Registrar Jack Dahl, 

This year, only 11,513 sludents were 
enrolled as of Aug. 31, compared to 11,701 
at the same time last year. That represents a 



drop of 1,6 percent. 

The decrease is not expected to have a 
profound effect on the campus budget 
because a drop in enrollment was foreseen. 
Tic decline in enrollment came totally from 
part-time students, said IPFW Chancellor 
Michael A. Wartcll. This "is related to 
strong employment opportunities in the 
region at this time," he said. 

Several departments are swelling against 



the decline in overall enrollment, according 
to Ihe News Bureau. The departments of 
biology, chemistry, dental education, geo- 
sciences, physics, public affairs, and sociol- 
ogy increased in enrollment. Wanell noted 
the strong showing by the science depart- 
ments underscores the need for a new 
Science Building. 

Other departments experiencing a rise in 
enrollment arc agriculture and forestry. 



English and linguistics, history, modem for- 
eign languages, and political science. 

The departments with a significant 
declining enrollment included communica- 
tion, philosophy, accounting, organizational 
leadership and supervision, education, com- 
puter science and engineering. 

A News Bureau survey indicated that 
minority students increased from 740 to 
835, an increase of 12.8 percent. Frank 



Borelli. vice chancellor for student affairs, 
said, "We are most pleased to sec that 
IPFW is being selected by increasing num- 
bers of minority students." 

The News Bureau reported that a record 
number of seniors relumed to IPFW from 
the main campuses. The number of seniors 
enrolled at IPFW increased 4.0 percent over 
last year's record.

Student designs rainbow sculptu 



re 



By S. Brant Keliey 
News Editor 

A permanent gift to IPFW now 
stands on the north side of the 
Classroom Medical Building, 

The gift is a sculpture of 25 col- 
ored pillars in a semi-circle. 
Thirteen colors were painted on the 
pillars. Professor of Civil and 
Architectural Engineering 

Technology Matthew Kubik said 
Ihe 13 colors represent diversity on 
Ihis campus, "...the multiple colors 
representing the diversity of the 
IPFW community all coming 
together in harmony to make this a 
great place," he said. 

Kubik said it was a gift from the 
student chapters of Associated 
Builders and Contractors (ABC) 
and American Institute of 
Architecture Students (AIAS) to 
commemorate the 25th anniversary 
of the IPFW campus. 

Kubik said Ihe idea for a gift to 
IPFW by the students was originat- 
ed by Scott Kellenberger, now a' 




graduate. He also said Ihe monu- 
ment is an example of ihe idea's 
effectiveness. 

Kellenberger contacted Kubik 
and the AIAS organized a design 
competition for the monument. He 
said the designs were judged by a 
professional jury composed of engi- 
neers, architects, and designers. The

V oter Registration 

Allen County residents who are 
U.S. citizens can register to vote at 
the IPFW political science office

Until Oct. 11, Allen County 
residents can register to vote at the 
voter registration office in ihe 
Keystone Building, 606 South 
Calhoun Street.

already registered to vote and 
those registering during the next 
few weeks will be eligible to vote 
in the general election on Nov. 8. 



competition's winner was Jodi M. 
Boyden, a graphic arts major. 

Kubik said all work on the sculp- 
ture was done by volunteers. While 
digging for the foundation, 
inclement weather forced the volun- 
teer sludents to work in knee-deep 
mud. 

The site on ihe nonh side of the 
Classroom Medical Building was 
chosen because the building pro- 
vides a good backdrop for the many 
colors of Ihe painted sculpture. 
Kubik said. 

The sculpture is there for more 
than looking. "I like this design 
because it is not just a piece of col- 
orful sculpture, but also a space 
where activities can occur, It would 
be a fine spot for a theater perfor- 
mance or for a band," he said. 

There is more work around the 
sculpture to be done, according to 
Kubik. Don Katter, director of the 
University Physical Plant, told 
Kubik he plans to install a path 
behind the Classroom Medical 
Building which would run close to 
the sculpture. Some landscaping 
needs to be finished. Kubik added. 



Scholarship money available 



By Angie Smith, 

Staff Writer 

and Kris tie Ricci Schlundt, 

Editor in Chiet 

Manv IPFW sludents feel that 
college scholarship opportunities 
arc limited. But according to Lois 
Kcltcrcr from the IPFW Center for 
Women and RctumingAdults, "A 
lot of people just don't know how 
to look for scholarship money. 
Students need to do some research, 
then go after it — that's what it 
takes. No one will knock on your 
door and say, 'Here it is!' " 

IPFW seniors F.dilh Follins and 
Jill A. Grosjean arc recent recipi- 
ents of scholarships offered by the 
Fort Wayne chapter of Executive 
Women International (EWI) and 
Ihe Arthur H. Carter Scholarship 
Fund, respectively. 

This is the fir-l time either schol- 
arship has been awarded to female 
students attending IPFW, 

Mary Brant, student employment 
coordinator and chair of the 
Executive Women International 
scholarship committee, presented 
an award of $1000 on Aug. 25 to 
Follins, a senior majoring in 
Criminal Justice. 

Brant said EWI supports the idea 
of expanding opportunities for col- 
lege women. "We only had six 
applications for the EWI scholar-

ship, believe it or not, even though 
we promoted the scholarship with 
the IPFW Center for Women and 
Returning Adults, the YWCA and 
the Fort Wayne Women's Bureau," 
Brant said. 

"The EWI scholarship offers 
support for women already work- 
ing. We're reaching out to women 
who don't have educational oppor- 
tunities," she added. 

Follins received the scholarship 
through the Adult Students in 
Scholastic Transition program. 

Grosjean, a senior majoring in 
accounting, won her scholarship 
from the Arthur H. Carter 
Scholarship Fund. The formal pre- 



sentation was made by Dyne 
Pfeffcnberger, IPFW associalc pro- 
fessor and chair of Ihe accounting 
department, during the first 
Accounting Society meeting on 
Aug. 31. 

Grosjean is a student member of 
the American Society of Women 
Accountants, and vice president of 
the Accounting Society. 

Students interested in researching 
scholarship opportunities can find 
the information thct need in the 
IPFW Financial Aid office. 
Supplementary information, how- 
ever, is also available in the office 
of the Center for Women and 
Returning Adults. 



ACPL, Helmke join forces 



By Jamie Craver 
Staff Writer 

Many students of IPFW and 
citizens of Allen County may 
not be aware that the Foellinger 
Foundation of Fort Wayne fund- 
ed a study this summer on how 
Allen County public libraries 
and the IPFW Helmke library 
could belter work together to 
benefit students and the com- 
munity. 

Staff from both libraries par- 
ticipated in the study and even- 
tually decided on five main 
objectives that would be recom- 
mended to the Foellinger 
Foundation, said Pamela 
Sandstrom, who was one of the 
participants in the study. 
Sandstrom outlined the five 
objectives: 

1. To improve communi- 
cation between the two 
libraries. Meetings between the 
two libraries' personnel to dis- 
cuss current issues and specific 
subjects of importance is one 
way lo facilitate communica- 
tion, the group decided; 

2. To set up collaborative 
staff training for employees 
from both libraries so that new 
technology and equipment at 
any branch could be discussed 
and learned: 

3. To improve access to 
all the library catalogs no mat- 
ter which library a student may 
happen to use. This would 



immediately allow students to 
see what library materials are 
available here in town without 
the need to travel to the differ- 
ent libraries to access that 
information; 

4. To create a fast and 
convenient document delivery 
system at all the libraries and 
between the ACPL and the 
Helmke library. The prospective 
system would allow anyone to 
order materials from any of the 
library branches and receive the 
material in a day or two. 
According lo Sandstrom, that 
innovation would prove the 
most beneficial lo sludents; and, 

5. To set up a 
"Community Information 
Network." Sandstrom slated. 
"This is also known as an 
'Information Highway' and, if 
implemented into the libraries, 
could be used to find an incal- 
culable amount of information 
very quickly and conveniently." 

With library assistants help- 
ing, library patrons could log 
onto the information network 
and access government docu- 
ments, presidential addresses, 
congressional debates, reference 
books, as well as fun things 
such as bobby and sports infor- 
mation, Sandstrom said. 

Shed added that with such a 
network, library patrons could 
have the benefit of E-mail, 
which would allow them to 
communicate with other people 



all across the U.S. 

Eventually the staff at the 
two libraries hope to organize a 
file on the information network 
that would give quick and easy 
access to any newspaper article 
ever published, Sandstrom 
claimed 

The cost for such a system, 
said Sandstrom. depends on 
how many of the proposed ser- 
vices are deemed by the 
Foellinger Foundation as bene- 
ficial to and necessary for the 
community. 

She added that the system 
could be spread into businesses, 
schools, legal services, and 
eventually even political offices 
so all could share and use infor- 
mation through the 'free-net' 
system. 

The Foellinger Foundation is 
presently reviewing these rec- 
ommendations and, in 
September, staff from the two 
libraries will meet with the 
committee to discuss which rec- 
ommendations to implement. 
Proposals will ihen be brought 
to the public to see what its 
reactions are to the proposed 
changes. 

Funding for these recommen- 
dations will rely on business 
and community donations as 
well as federal grants. The new 
library system is proposed to be 
in effect sometime around Dec. 
1995.

Beyond Race and Gender 



By Bettye Poignard 

Assistant Dean of Students and 

Director of Multicultural Services 

At a recent cultural diversity 
workshop, the facilitator began her 
remarks to an uneasy audience by 
saying. '"Diversity is not just about 
race and gender...." Before she 
could finish her statement, several 
members of the audience began to 
nod their beads in agreement. 
Many of them had smiles on their 
faces and seemed relieved, or at 
least that was my perception of 
their behavior. The speaker contin- 
ued by saying, "...but it is about 
race and gender, and difference and 
similarities, and many other things. 
I smiled and nodded my head in 
relief that Ibis was apparently not 
going lo be another one of ihose 
attempts to avoid any discussion of 
race and gender. I understand my 
colleagues' hesitation because all 
of us could remember some very 
unpleasant experiences under the 
name of "diversity." I was especial- 
ly hopeful that we would engage in 
some discussion concerning the 
richness that various cultures bring 
to the tabic in their differences as 
well as in their similarities. I want- 
ed an opportunity to share with the 
audience the idea that being "dif- 
ferent" was not synonymous wilh 
the term "negative." I had heard too 
many well-meaning individuals 
say, "Why do we always concen- 
trate on our differences (implying 
negativity), rather than on our simi- 
larities?" 

Ann Morrison, author of "The 
New Leaders: Guidelines on 



Leadership Diversity in America." 
docs not find it surprising that 
attempts at diversity are suspect by 
many individuals, or that work- 
shops are approached wilh great 
apprehension. She is convinced, 
and so am I, that mosl effort-s begin 
with high hopes and very little 
expertise. Too many organizations 
fail to, first, define what they mean 
by diversity and, second, they fail 
to identify the organizational cul- 
ture, the elements that influence or 
determine the organization's philo- 
sophical point of view concerning 
diversity, 

R. Roosevelt Thomas, Jr. in his 
recent book entitled: "Beyond Race 
and Gender" calls this "cultural 
audit" essential. From his perspec- 
tive, there can be no substitute for 
this. He cautions those organiza- 
tions who are tempted to change 
how people act before investigating 
why they act as they do. 

Investigating or assessing the 
roots helps organizations determine 
whether the systems or individuals 
currently in place generate support 
or hindrance to diversity. Such 
assessments are completed ihrough 
surveys, in-depth interviews, 
reviews of organizational docu- 
ments, focus groups, or direct 
observations. 

Some of the common "roots" 
discovered by both Morrison and 
Thomas included, but were not lim- 
ited to, the following: 

The "melting pot" mythology. 
Organizations in this category find 
that (hey pride themselves on being 
"color-blind." The implication here 
is that the company or organization 



expects everyone to assimilate. 
Diversity is usually not accepted 
here. 

The "company -is- like- a- family" 
roots, which usually has a "father- 
knows-best" approach. Success in 
such organizations is usually based 
on bow well one emulates the boss. 
This is the opposite of diversity. 

"Cream-rise s-to-the-lop" roots. 
Thomas reminds us that in mosl 
organizations "cream" is pulled or 
pushed to the (op by an informal 
system of mentoring and sponsor- 
ship In order to obtain the best 
results from diversity, mentors and 
sponsors must work effectively for 
all groups 

"Wc-arc-all-a-team" roots. 
While this is more supportive of 
diversity than the "family" 
approach, it often generates a 
rough-and-tumble athletic kind of 
nunuring which might be less sup- 
portive of employees who do not 
subscribe to the "sparing partner" 
approach 

Once an organization has 
unearthed the core cultural assump- 
tions or roots within the organiza- 
tion concerning diversity and has 
analyzed the impact of those roots 
on the success or hindrance of 
diversity, it can begin to identify 
those roots that need to be changed, 
to make some comparisons 
between the status quo and the 
desired results. Fortunately for 
those of us attending the cultural 
diversity workshop, the facilitator 
had read both Morrison and 
Thomas. 



Objectivity leads to greater diversity 



By Ann Colbert 

Journalism Program Coordinator 

Mosl reporters strive for objec- 
tivity, whether they achieve it or 
not, so the invitation to "write what 
1 think about diversity" is less an 
opportunity than a challenge. Yet 
I'd be remiss if I didn't say that I 
think that the role the press plays in 
promoting ideas and acceptance of 
diversity is extremely important. 

We must encourage those who 
bring us the news lo bring us 
diverse points of view. And we 
must remember that diversity is not 
simply a matter of race or gender, 
although those elements are indeed ' 
important. 

The problem with "diversity" as 
a goal is that it tends to label per- 
spectives in a narrow way. We 
have to be careful not to assume 
that there is a "black" or "white" or 
"Latino" point of view, that one 
voice can express the view of an 
ethnic group. 

Journalists do, I believe, have a 
responsibility to represent or cover 
a number of different voices in 
their news coverage. They also 
must realize the limitations in try- 
ing to find a single voice to repre- 
sent large and diverse groups of 
people. One Republican respon- 
dent to a speech of Bill Clinton's 
doesn't handle the range of opposi- 
tion: a partisan advocate can't give 
all the reasons for supporting a cer- 
tain piece of legislation either. 

The lesson of diversity is that 
each group is created of diverse 
voices, that there is no single opin- 
ion representative of the whole of 
African Americans or Native 
Americans or Latinos or Hispanics 
or Asian Americans or Irish 
Americans or German Americans 
or any of the other Americans thai 
make up our country. "Our country 
is the world— Our countrymen are 
all mankind," reads the motto of 
The Liberator, William Lloyd 
Garrison's abolitionist newspaper 
from the 1830s. 

Something I try to do each 
semester is ask my students what 
they read and watch in the media. 
And for the past ten years, I've 
observed a continuing trend: Fewer 
and fewer of us are familiar with 
the same media. Fewer of us read 
the same magazines or watch the 



same television shows. 

This situation offers challenges 
and opportunities. Communication 
has to be a goal, not a byproduct. 

As we become more and more 
specialized, we separate into groups 
based on interest rather than gender 
or race. The "superhighway" of 
information services, in fact, creates 
populations which interact intimate- 
ly and have no idea what race or 
gender or native land their new 
friends can be identified by. 

As we move into new forms of 
media, we nevertheless remain in 
touch with the old. And the con- 

"The lesson of 

diversity is that each 
group is created of 
diverse voices, that 
there is no single 
opinion representa- 
tive of the whole of 
African American 
or Native Americans 
or Latinos or 
Hispanics or Asian 
Americans or Irish 
Americans or 
German Americans 
or any of the other 
Americans that 
make up our coun- 
try:' 

...'..■ni- with diversity and with media 
fairness to all groups continue. 

Articles on a variety of issues 
concerning diversity have been col- 
lected in the most recent issue of 
"Media Studies Journal" published 
quarterly by the Freedom Forum 
Media Studies Center at Columbia 
University. 

That the issue of the journal is 
entitled "Race — America's Rawest 
Nerve" is instructive, as are the 
tides of 18 thought-provoking sepa- 
rate articles involved in reviewing 



America's so-called melting pot. 
Four examples will have to suffice, 
Ellis Cose, a Newsweek con- 
tributing editor, examines the fact 
that much of conventional journal- 
ism remains fixated on the lives of 
the while and the wealthy. The title 
of his piece is "Seething in 
Silence — The News in Black and 
White." 

Melita Marie Garza, Chicago 
Tribune ethnic affairs reporter, sur- 
veys what is described as an 
"explosion" of Spanish-language 
newspapers published by main- 
stream newspapers in "Hola, 
America! Newstand 2000." 

Manning Marble, chair of 
Columbia University's African- 
American research center, writes 
that the media has a decisive role to 
play in overturning negative images 
of inequality His article is entided 
"Reconciling Race and Reality." 

William Wong, a columnist for 
the Oakland Tribune, writes of the 
spotty, sensationalized coverage 
given America's new Asian com- 
munity. His article is entitled 
"Covering the Invisible "Model' 
Minority." 

As the tides and names of these 
four articles suggest, diversity in 
the media is indeed complex. Some 
of the angriest readers of main- 
stream media, in fact, arc those who 
are seething that the "race" issue 
has been so simplified. Richard 
Harwood of The Washington Post 
would argue that having a news- 
room of "diverse" colors but com- 
posed of representatives of the mid- 
dle class is not supporting mixed 
opinions at all. 

My own view is that as long as 
we're talking and learning and. 
mosl of all, willing to listen, we can 
avoid the fate of Northern Ireland, 
South Africa, or the former 
Yugoslavia where ethnicity pro- 
vides instruction of a frightening 
sort. 

This is a university, a place 
where new ideas and identities can 
be explored. Safety for that process 
is an essential role for educators. 
And while we attempt to open the 
discussion, we must refuse to enfee- 
ble the discussion by too many 
restraints on expression.

Letters to the Editor 

Student questions Black Rage 



To the editor, 

I did not realize thai Fred Douse 
bad received bis master's in psy- 
chology over ihe summer. 

I mean, after all, he has so ele- 
gantly (once again) defended ibe 
violem actions of others wilb his 
keen intelligence and charming wit 
For the second lime in a few 
months period, Mr. Douse has sup- 
ported the notion that violence is 
just Okec-Dokce. After all, if you 
have an excuse to kill then every- 
thing is all right in the eyes of the 



judicial system. Ibe government, the 
Constitution, and the people. 

The rights of others can easily be 
waived if someone is in "Rage." 
Hell, look at the Incredible Hulk. 

No one blamed him for his 
Gamma-induced anger. In fact, he 
became a national super-hero. 

I finally see, thanks 10 Mr, 
Douse, that violence is a great way 
to blow off anger. That by hurting 
another person, I can team 10 cope 
with my own problems in the 
world. I can be a normal, healthy. 
live-io-be-100, human being. 



In fact, we should all take Mr. 
Douse's advice. Why stop at "Black 
Rage"? We are discriminating from 
all other rages people may have. 
For example: "While, Female 
Polish- American Rage," "Roman 
Catholic Rage," "Divorced Father 
of Two Rage." "Baseball Strike 
Rage." and lets not forget "I'm 
Hypoglycemic and IAte too Many 
Twinkies Rage." 

We can all go out and stab, 
shoot, or/ and strangle each other 
until we completely resolve our 
own inner conflicts. And when it's 



over, the few of us that are left can 
then go on and live nice productive 
lives. Mr. Ghandi sure would be 
proud of the way we handled 
things. I'm sure. 

Violence Isn't so bad. after all, I 
see the big picture now, and I thank 
Mr. Douse ever so much, 

So, in the words of the illustri- 
ous Dr. David Banner, "Don't make 
me in i.! .. n won't like me when 
I'm angry."

Writer cautions administration 



To the editor. 

I am acquainted with an elderly 
gentlemen who survived the Nazi 
reign of terror. My friend, whom I 
will call Job, studied music at the 
local university in one of the larger 
German cities. 

He told me that shortly after the 
Nazis' ascendancy, disillusionment 
set in. The Nazis began with small 
indiscretions which led to more 
heinous discriminations. The Nazis 
eventually replaced the comman- 
dant with one of their lackey pup- 
pets. This marionette, whom I will 
call Lorelei, introduced a slow ero- 
sion of both student and faculty 
rights and privileges. 

This process of erosion com- 
menced by restricting access to the 
school's practice rooms. In con- 
junction with this, Job also found 



thai access to the school pianos 
became very limited and also that 
be, as a student, would not have to 
pay to see the school's concerts. Job 
felt that this hindered his education 
as a musician and pianist 

But the party in power also 
mixed many ludicrous acts in with 
some necessary adjustments, such 
as transferring the student lounge to 
a better location and placing confi- 
dential records in the old room 
(which was open to the public). 
Lorelei then took the students' own 
property and sold it at public auc- 
tion. Just as today, this constituted 
conversion, and Lorelei seemed 
oblivious to this fact. The building 
manager had previously endorsed 
the students' personal purchase and 
use of appliances in the lounge. 
The commandant of the school, 



whom I will call Baron 
Munchausen, had also misled the 
student government's appropria- 
tions committee into believing they 
were giving money for student 
activities when in actuality he later 
told Lorelei to "use this money in 
any way you see fit." He even went 
so far as to propagandize in the 
school newspaper. 

By this time, Baron Munchausen 
and Lorelei were blatantly treating 
the alumni and faculty with extreme 
discourtesy and prejudice: belittling 
certain majors, shunning certain 
"pro-student" faculty, and reassign- 



ing class schedules to professors 
who lacked quantitative knowledge 
and/or experience. 

Have we not learned the lessons 
of history? Would any of us allow 
this to happen again? I, along with a 
majority of other students and fac- 
ulty, perceive an historical deja vu. 
Yet these atrocities arc only the lip 
of the iceberg. I implore you, oh 
administration, not to let history 
repeat itself.

Alternative Review 



The Verve display hypnotic side 



By Jamie Crave 
Ftattira Writer 

Yes, I am back from a shon but 
wonderful summer to bring you 
reviews of the hottest new alterna- 
tive music and concerts. Over the 
summer, I was fortunate enough to 
attend Lollapalooza '94 at the 
World Music Theater near Chicago. 
Pot those of you who may not 
know, this concert is a day-long dis- 
play of some of the best bands that 
alternative music has 10 offer, as 
well as a variety of other sideline 
tidbits of interest such as the mist 
tents and the 'Spoken Word' tent. 

If you did attend Lollapalooza 
'94, you may or may not have 
caught The Verve who were play- 
ing on the second stage, which is 
reserved for the lesser known 
bands. I was so impressed by this 
band that I immediately walked 
over to a record stand nearby and 
bought their new album "No Come 
Down," which is a compilation of D 



sides, concert performances and 
previous albums. 

The title (rack from the album is 
a slow, entrancing tune which 
shows you the ability of this group 
to drug you up on their soft, psyche- 
delic music. And drugs arc some- 
thing (hat this band has no problem 
admitting the use of When their 
first album was released, they were 
unemployed and wrote their music 
late at night while using drugs to 
help inspire them. 

The Verve is led by Richard 
Ashcrofl. vocals, along with lead 
guitarist Nick Mccabe. bassist 
Simon Jones, and drummer Peter 
Salisbury. If you did not catch this 
great live band at Lollapalooza — 
they also opened up for the likes of 
Smashing Pumpkins last fall — then 
you can gel a taste of just how good 
Ihcy are on a great live cut on the 
album "Gravity Grave." 

Acoustic versions of "Make It 
'Til Monday" and "Butterfly" 
expose tbe raw lalent and the 



smooth melodic grip of The Verve. 
The best track on the new album, 
"One Way To Go," is a scven-and-a 
half minute venture into some great 
guitar rifls. 

Where The Verve can be best 
compared to The Doors or The 
Black Crows, they truly do have a 
style that is all their own. Overall, 
"No Come Down" is very good, but 
not great, simply because it is not a 
full-fledged release of new material. 
Just as Nirvana's "Incesticide" 
which is a similar compilation of B 
sides and outtakes is good, it was 
not great like their two other 
albums. You may want to first 
check out The Verve's debut 
release "A Storm In Heaven," 
which shows the true strength of 
their music and is a great album. 

Be sure to catch "Alternative 
reView" next week when 1 travel to 
Ball State to catch Nine Inch Nails 
in what promises to be a wild con- 
cert in a very small place. Til next 
week....

ing of five learning levels, and a 
rocket will blast off when the 
game is completed. The kids also 
try to beat the clock, 

"The idea is lhat the kids have 
fun and at the same time pick up 
computer skills," said Queen. He 
makes the games more fun by 



JoAnne Tarango. Every Thursday making a contest out of learning, 
at 5:30 pm, they spend one hour When Queen started looking 

"mentoring" the kids. 

Queen came up with the idea of 
developing software for kids to 
help them prepare for the fall 
semester in math, English and typ- 
ing. Queen's ultimate goal is to 



for volunteers, Charles 
Washington recommended Douse, 
an active IPFW student 

Douse is president of Alpha Phi 
Alpha Fraternity, a student sena- 
tor, and chair of legislative affairs 



ter game 
teens 

Willi ihc IPFW Student 
Government Association, Douse is 
.i junior studying interpersonal 
communication and radio-televi- 
sion- film. 

"I like giving back to the com- 
munity and working with the 
kids," said Douse. 

Tarango is a sophomore at 
IPFW and president of Hispanos 
Unidos for the 1994-95 school 
year. She was asked by Douse to 
volunteer, 

"The kids don't look at this as 
teaching, they look at it as playing 
games, having fun and learning," 
said Tarango. 

The kids come from various 
economic backgrounds and, when 
the program started, Queen did not 
know what to expect. 

When he was teaching six-col- 
umn multiplication tables, he was 
amazed at how quickly some of 
the kids picked up the rule of neg- 
ative numbers. One kid who 
picked up the concept quickly was 
overheard the nexi day explaining 
it lo another kid, an example of the 
program's success. There are four 
weeks left in the program. 



Correction 



In last week's issue of The 
Communicator dated 

Thursday. September I, we 
incorrectly stated that all of 
the season's plays were cast 
in one afternoon. 

It should have read: four of 
the shows were auditioned for 
the semester. Auditions for 



LHI'IMgfclH 



another four shows will be 
held in January. We apolo- 
gize for any inconvenience 
this may have caused.

Career Directions offers Gourmet "Food to Go" 



new path to job success 



By Jo Ann Strinforth 
Ft a tu ret Editor 

IPFW students interested in the 
road lo .■*■-■■ ■ may be inn r.. &lt;■. d in 
attending ibe Career Directions 
Workshop on Tuesday. Sept. 13. 
from 5 10 7 p.m. 

The event is sponsored by IPFW 
Career Services and will be held in 
the Walb Memorial Union. 

IPFW Career Services advisers 
will be on hand for Power Hour. 10 
be held from 5 lo 6 p.m., in whicb a 
variety of career topics such as 
business etiquette, body language 
and interviewing, mock Interviews 
and resume critiquing will be dis- 
cussed. A business dressing fashion 
show will also be offered. 

Later, an employer panel will be 
held from 6 to 7 p.m. in the Walb 
Memorial Ballroom. 

Local business professionals 
will discuss resumes that get 
results, interviewing for success, 
relevant experiences for job suc- 
cess, communication that works 
and networking for advancement 

The idea for Career Directions 
was conceived by Gregory 
Jacquay. Jacquay went to a national 
conference this summer, and it was 
there he realized how important 
professional contacts and network- 
ing is to a job seeker. He is an 
Organizational Leadership and 
Supervision major and plans to 
graduate in December 1994. 

Linda Scott, director of IPFW 
Carter Services, sees a "loosening 
up" in the job market. As far as 
employment trends arc concerned, 
she sees' an increasing number of 
job opportunities on the horizon for 
Northeast Indiana. 

New support 
group forms 

By Kara Whiting 
Features Writer 

If you have ever felt that you 
needed to talk with someone 
about an ethnic problem or an 
issue as a woman, now is your 
chance to get involved. 

A new peer support group 
has been established on the 
IPFW campus called The 
Women of Color Support 
Group 

Founded by Geneva Burgess, 
the group is just getting started 
as you read this. Burgess said 
the main focus of the group is 
(0 discuss women's issues. 

Burgess is still searching for 
members to help get her group 
off to a healthy start. When 

asked where she intended to see 
the group go, she said, "Well, I 
need to see who is in it first, 
then we'll go from there." 

She found the need 10 start a 
support group such as ibis 
because she believes women of 
color oftentimes feel isolated 
and hopes to discuss these prob- 
lems and concerns on campus in 
this group. 



There will be business profes- 
sionals from five companies in 
attendance for Career Directions: 
Lisa Mungovan from Navistar 
International. Bruce Bucban from 
George S. Olive, C.P.A., Karen 
Stinson from Fort Wayne National 
Bank. Steve Beck from Coopers &amp; 
Lybrand, C.P.A., and Allyn 
Wbislcr from Northwestern Mutual 
Bain). 

According to Scott, Career 
Directions should better prepare a 
student to attend campus inter- 
views. 

Regular campus interviews will 
be conducted from September 
through December, with forty com- 
panies visiting the campus. Any 
interested job seekers may arrange 
an interview with any of the 
employers through the Office of 
Career Services.

Scon's request that all student 
organizations gel involved. 

How important is networking in 
the current job market? 

"Networking is a skill job appli- 
cants need a lot of expertise in; a 
lot of times il's who you know," 
said Scott. 

The focus of Career Directions 
is to reassure the student population 
lhat career success can be achieved 
through different career paths, thai 
there is no one answer 10 achieve 
that success said Scon. 

"Career Directions is a no-cosi 
program for all students and a good 
way to get started in a job search," 
said Scott, adding "or lo fine tune 
skills and get curreni job trends 
from the five employers."

Women 's tennis kicks off season 



By Eric Butter, 
Sports Editor 

The 1PFW women's tennis learn 
is starling off a new season with 
much enthusiasm and high expecta- 
tions After a disappointing 3-11 
record two years ago. they came 
back last year going 10-3 for the 



A lot of credit can be given to 
senior Jenny Jackson, the numb« 1 
singles player last year who only 
had two losses all year. Jenny said 
she is excited about the new season 
and looks to have another great 
year. 

Lisa Baumganner. a graduate of 



Norwell High School and a fresh- 
man this year, will try to raise ber 
level of play to help the team win 
Lisa and the rest of the team will 
have to step up this year due to los- 
ing their number 2 and number 5 
players from last year. 

Coach Dan Brogan is very opti- 
mistic and said that be likes (he tal- 



ent on this years team. The only 
questions left unanswered are about 
tbe doubles teams. If they can find 
consistency there, then they should 
do well in the conference. Tbe real 
test will be this weekend when they 
face off against conference foes 
Indiana Wesleyan and Kent State. 



IPFW women's volleyball team high on 
talent and ready to roll, coach said 



By Eric Butler, 
Sports Editor, and 
Dave Becker, 
Staff Writer 

This year's IPFW women's vol- 
leyball squad looks to be a promis- 
ing and fun bunch to watch. They 
have already gotten their first tour- 
nament out of the way and now 
know what aspects of their game 
need work. 

Despite going one in three this 
past weekend. Coach Tim Hcffron 
was pleased with the effort from his 



team. Tim said there were some 
mental mistakes, but overall be was 
pleased. 

Each game was close and could 
have gone cither way. Coach 
Heffron foresees the mental mis- 
takes dwindling as the season pro- 
gresses. His main concern is with 
the uppcrclassmen. According to 
him, they have yet to show the lead- 
ership qualities needed to carry a 
team to a winning season. Coach 
Heffron also said they need to step 
up their game, which they failed to 
do in the first tournament. 



The team also lost their senior 
setter and has no back-up. which 
called for some player rearrange- 
ments. But Coach Heffron believes 
they've solved that problem. 

As far as strengths, the team is in 
better physical condition than last 
year. This is due to the off-season 
training the coach required. He's 
pleased with the results which have 
made his team more athletic. 

This year's team is led by co- 
captains April Bair. Heather 
Teagarden and Julie Parrot.
