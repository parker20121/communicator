May 1996. 

"I have been subjected

Walker also said he has written to 
Chancellor Michael Wartell, the IPFW

acknowledgment or reply. 

According to the accounting depart-

tenure, "exceptionally meritorious work"

by Nol Beckley 
Editor 

An assistant professor in the depart- 
ment of accounting and finance has filed 
a discrimination suit against the univer- 
sity, charging that race, age and retalia- 
tion were used as deciding factors for the 
professor's denial of tenure, 

William Walker, a 54-year-old 
African-American assistant professor of 
commercial law, filed a suit on Sept. 18 
in which he said he has been "denied 
salary increases ... in retaliation for com- 
plaints of civil rights violations and ... 
reversing a previous fraudulent dis- 
charge,"

about the suit. "I

what I'd be allowed 
to say even if I knew

News Analysis 



The verdict of the century 



Students crowded 
around every avail- 
able TV last Tuesday 
to hear O.J. s fate 



by Daniel J. Westrick 
Staff Reporter and 
Melissa Young-Flores 
News Editor 

Last Tuesday Judge Lance 
Ito's clerk announced the 
fate of sports figure O.J. 
Simpson. Her words were 
immediately broadcast 
around the world in what has 
been called the verdict of the 
century. 

At IPFW students herded 
around every available TV 
on campus. Once ihe long 
awaited verdict had been 
revealed, individuals relished 
over the year-long event, 
reminding each other of who 
had predicted the outcome 
correctly. Currently, 

Simpson is expected to be in 
court again soon to maintain 
Ihe guardianship of his chil- 



dren. The par- 
ents of Nicole 
Brown-Simpson 
are expected to 
petition for cus- 
tody of Sidney 
and Justin 
Simpson. 

Some were 
shocked, others were out- 
raged. And soon the people 
who had given up months of 
their lives were put on trial 
by the American public. 

Students, like the 
American people, held many 
different feelings. 

"The verdict did not sur- 
prise me," said Freshman 
Ryan Perrotte. Perrotte's 
classmate Jeff Cooper 
agreed. "1 figured he would 
get off." said Cooper. 

Others believed the sys- 
tem had done its job. "Justice 
has been served." said 
Sophomore Kevin Orthman 

Many fear Simpson was 
found not guilty, not because 
he was innocent, but because 
he is O.J. Simpson. "I 
thought the jury would not 



convict him because he is O. 
J Simpson." said IPSGA 
Judicial Court member and 
junior Andy Hogan. 

Hogan said, however, the 
prosecution did nol prove the 
charges beyond reasonable 
doubt, "1 think the state did 
not do their job and left the 
door open for the jury to 
have doubt," said Hogan. 

The question of justice for 
the Goldman and Brown 
families was raised moments 
after the verdict. Fred 
Goldman. Ron Goldman's 
father, spoke after the 
announcement and asked 
where the justice was in all 
of this, He also attacked 
Johnnie Cochran's analogy 
of Mark Fuhrman as HiUer. 

"I feel that no justice was 
served to the victims' fami- 
lies." said Freshman Heather 
S larks. 

Some believe Goldman's 
father will seek his own jus- 
tice. "He was guilty. I think 
Fred Goldman is going to 
kill O.J. Simpson." said 
Freshman Jennifer Jones. 



Campus, nation reach out to detect depression 



University joins 
nation by offering 
free depression 
screening. 

by Rebecca Koenig 
Chief Reporter 

Everyone has their bad times, but 

when those become excessively harmful 
to an indiudual it may be lime to inves- 
tigate the possibility of chronic depres- 

Often depression can be remedied by 
a few simple means. The first step 
toward overcoming depression is to 



realize thai a problem does exist. 
Depression Screening Day. an 
outreach event of Mental Illness 
Awareness Week, will be held on 
Thursday, Oct. 26, in Rooms 224 
and 228 of Walb Union. The 
screening will begin at noon and 
should lasl for about two hours. It 
is free and IPFW students, faculty 
and starf, along with their fami- 
lies, are invited to attend. 
The signs of depression vary from 
person to person, but some of Ihe most 
common signs are having trouble sleep- 
ing and/or eating and feeling sad, lonely 
and empty. Treatment varies according 
to the classification and cause of the 
depression. 

Two different types of treatment are 
available: chemical therapy and psy- 
chotherapy. Many limes counseling is 



all that is necessary. Other times a 
chemical imbalance may be at fault, and 
medication may be prescribed. People 
who arc diagnosed wiih clinical depres- 
sion are referred for treatment. 

The screening will consist of various 
activities. A written self test will help 
individuals determine whether or not 
they suffer from depression. A multime- 
dia presentation is planned to educate 
observers about depression. 

A confidential meeung with a profes- 
sional in the mental health field could 
benefn people who believe they suffer 
from depression, however this meeting 
is nol a counseling session. 

According to Judy Wilkins, filness 
wellness coordinator for IPFW and 
coordinator for the screening, last year's 
turnout consisted of about 90 people. 

Wdkins said she hopes for an even 



better turnout this year This is the sec- 
ond annual screening in which IPFW 
has taken part. 

Eli Lilly &amp; Co. sponsors the annual 
event which is also designed to help 
educate the public as well as assist peo- 
ple who suffer from clinical depression. 

"The main focus is to define whai is 
a true depression." said Fred Smith, 
clinical director for Lindenview 
Counseling Services, which held 
depression screening on Thursday. 
Oct. 5. 

This depression screening is spon- 
sored by the IPFW Wellness Council

Welcome the 
birth of the 
'O.J. Generation' 



"Where were you when 
Kennedy was shot"? 

This question defined a genera- 
tion. It is a sure bet that the ques- 
tion that defines our generation 
Iwenly years from now will be. 
"Where were you when OJ. was 
acquitted?" This is not a good 
thing. Our generation has aJrcady 
been plagued by Ihe "Generation 
X" label and the "slacker" defini- 
tion. We will now forever be 
known as the "O. J. Generation " 

This may not seem like a big 
deal to those in other generations, 
but it is to us, because we are being 
labeled. This fate seems to be 
inevitable, (hough we have been 
trying desperately not to let it hap- 
pen. Our ciders, the "Baby 
Boomers," feel the need to label 
everything. They even used to 
name their dances We arc more 
free-flowing than that When we 
dance, we just get on the dance 
floor and move, letting the music 
have it's effect on us, not at all 
boom eristic 

Being defined as the "O.J. 
Generation" will have profound 
effects on us all. This country has 
divided itself between those who 
arc pro-choice and those who are 
pro-life. We will soon be divided 
by those who agreed with the 
acquittal and those who disagree. 
Imagine trying to find a partner 
who is both pro-life AND who 
agreed with the acquittal. This 
country is divided in so many other 
ways — race, sexual orientation, 
economic status, etc. — that being 
divided by this issue may prove to 
be too complex. 

Kids of the "O.J Generation" 
will giow up with a distorted view 
of our judicial system. They will 
grow up thinking that money can 
buy murderer's freedom and that 
jurors favor their own race, not the 



truth. They will think these things 
because that is what the nation is 
talking about today Even if anoth- 
er person is found to be guilty of 
these murders, less attention will be 
placed on them, and kids may 
never know the truth. Instead, they 
will only know the version society 
is now telling them. 

History will tell Ihe O.J. 
.Simpson story inadequately, simply 
because he is African American. So 
much focus on race will cause 
those after us to view the story of 
this trial incon-ectly It could be 25 
years before we even begin to 
know the truth, as with the war in 
Vietnam. And then it will not be 
front page news, but merely a blip 
in some "information" source. 

This country will never be the 
same. 

We will soon see various books 
by all involved with this trial. 
Twenty years from now, we will 
see a slew of follow-up books by 
those who will have spent all of 
their money made by the first 
books Movies of the week, mini- 
series and feature films will be 
made. There is no escaping this 
overpowering drama. There could 
even be a soundtrack album 

But it doesn't have to be this 
way. We need to stand up and 
express our desire to be remem- 
bered for who we are, not how we 
feel about a trial that has very little 
to do with us personalty, Don't buy 
the books or watch the movies. 
Refuse to watch a movie starring 
Tom Cruise as OJ Simpson. The 
entertainment field will get the 
message when they lose massive 
amounts of money. 

With that said, let's just be us, 
not the generation the media or our 
elders want us to be. 



Paint the campus red 



Student calls 
for action 

by Philip Snodderly 

Guest Columnist 

I think IPFW sucks, because it 
brings out the commuter-college 
syndrome in all of us, Where's the 
action, the activities, the (re-resis- 
tance? I mean, come on, people. 
get involved One of the greatest 
memories of your life will be the 
college years Hello!!? This is 
your wake up call. Why? 

1 am here to tell you what it is 
all about 1 went to high school on 
a college campus. The place was 
packed everyday, you'd be lucky to 
get a parking space and most of (he 
lime you're trying to dodge in and 
out of enormous crowds to get to 
your classes. Can somebody tell 
me what's wrong with IPFW? 

No? Let me elaborate. There's 
no campus parties, no disgustingly 



small dorms to cramp your space, 
no sorry bands and no craziness 
which makes life a complete blur 
from day to day. The average day 
consists of getting up, doing the 
shower, shave, shampoo (not nec- 
essarily in (hat order), going to 
class, traveling home, and/or to 
work. What's wrong with this pic- 
ture? There's no excitement, no 
entertainment, no hangouts and the 
cafeteria ah... what's the word for 
it... SUCKS!!? 

This campus needs some life, a 
little style and a lot more funding, 
though that's another argument in 
itself. Let's organize some student 
activities, have casino nights, start 
student rallies or picket for civil 
rights. I don't care, just do some- 
thing The only action I sec is the 
occasional circle of ecstatic friends 
hacky sacking. At least they're 
doing something and having fun at 
it People, gel up and live! Where 
are you?

Commentary 



Remember trial process before 
blaming Simpson jurors 




Paul Tupper 
Qay-ty 
^forward 



So much 
has been said 

about the 
acquittal of 
O.J Simpson 
that I don't 
know where to 
begin. Many 
say that race 
got him off. 
while others 
say it was 
money. The 
one thing 
everyone seems to agree on is the 
damage this trial has done to race 
relations. Whites are devastated 
and feel that justice has not been 
served, and blacks are celebrating 
the freedom of a hero. No matter 
how you feel about the verdict, 
there are some issues you need to 
remember before you become dis- 
traught with grief... 

Rrst, we have a judicial system 
founded by the fathers of this coun- 
try based on British common law. 
This is the format we have chosen 



to try our accused and it is a system 
in which many believe. Although 
many have slipped through (he sys- 
tem and others have been unjustly 
convicted, this is the system we 
currently use to answer these ques- 
tions. Just because the outcome 
does not fall the way you wanted, il 
does not mean you should nol 
respec( i(. For those of you who 
disagree, you would have been 
bouncing off walls insisting that 
justice was served if Simpson were 
convicted. The jury, which was 
selected in the same fashion as 
every other trial, made their deci- 
sion. It is the job we asked them to 
perform and they did. Therefore, 
we must respect their decision. 

Second, race was an issue in this 
trial, and if you have forgotten, lis- 
ten to the tape of Mark Fuhrman. 
Johnnie Cochran has said that he 
used race, because one uses what 
one knows to do his or her job and 
he has dealt with racial discrimina- 
tion. Sounds right to me. Life is a 
constant learning process. You 



learn and use what you know 
everyday, in every situation. Can 
wc criticize Cochran for doing that ' 
Ten of the twelve jurors were 
women. With the evidence of emer- 
gency calls made by Nicole Brown 
Simpson to authorities during argu- 
ments with O.J.. these women 
could have convicted him simply 
because he bad abused his wife. 
Knowing that they did not let this 
issue sway their decision, we can- 
not justify saying that race moti- 
vated their verdict I truly believe 
thai if this jury could keep focused 
on the subject of murder and not 
physical abuse, then this predomi- 
nately black jury could have come 
to a decision based on the facts and 
not their personal'reelings about 
race. 

Third, many have accused 
Simpson of buying the acquittal 
They say this when they know deep 
inside they would have done the 
same thing if they had the money. 
You can't tell me that if you had 
his money you wouldn't have (he 



best lawyers money can buy 
Maybe people are not angry (hat 
Simpson used his money to his 
advantage, but jealous that they 
wouldn't have the means to do (he 
same. 

You also must remember (ha( 
(his jury heard EVERYTHING. 
Whereas you and I may have 
watched the trial closely, wc could 
not have possibly seen everything. 
Sound biles summarized what hap- 
pened, bu( only the jury saw every- 
thing. They were in fact the best 
people to make this decision. As I 
said above, we must respect tha( 
decision. 

I wasn't saddened by the acquit- 
tal at all A guilty verdict would not 
bring Ron and Nicole back from 
the dead, but I am saddened by the 
damage this has done to race rela- 
tions. We must pull back together 
and learn to love each other more 
than before this trial

Souder's raid on 
student aid: 
silence = consent 



hy Jeff Brunson 
KX-communkaled 

If'FW alumni and 4th district 
Rep. Mark Soulier received a green 
light from 1P1-W students 10 contin- 
ue his raid on student loans and 
financial aid when he visited the 
campus Thursday, Oct. 5, on a day 
no classes were in session. Prior lo 
Souder's appearance, this writer 
and other IPFW students posted 
notices (we put 'cm up as quickly 
as the campus thought police tore 
'em down) concerning Souder's 
positions. He has voted to cut stu- 
dent loans and aid money and other 
programs, in order to finance a lax 
break lor corporalions and people 
with incomes up to S200.000 per 
year (Source-. AFL-CIO Legislation 
Alert! 5/29/95). 

Student resistance lo Souder's 
assault on their educational oppor- 
tunities was underwhelming, judg- 
ing hy the scant number that 
showed up at Souder's gathering. 
This is surprising when one consid- 
ers the efforts by Soudcr and the 
rest of Newt's followers to restrict 
student access lo higher education. 
The following items are quoted 
from The Alliance to Save Student 
Aid, Sept. 1. 1995: 

* "Both the House and Senate 
agreed lo cut S10.5 billion from the 
Slafford loan program, targeting 
their cuts completely at students. 
while ignoring the billion dollar 
subsidies to banks and loan agen- 
cies that use government money to 
make student loans The House 
Appropriations Committee has rec- 
ommended eliminating the in- 
school interest exemption for grad- 
uate and professional students." 

* "The House Appropriations 
Committee adopted a plan that 
would remove 2.8 million students 
from the fell Grant program, elimi- 
nate the State Student Incentive 
Grant program and hold funding at 
1995 levels for other major student 
aid programs. including 
Supplemental Educational 
Opportunity Grants (S583.4 mil- 
lion), Federal Work Study (S616.5 
million) and TRIO (S463 million)." 

• "In addition, the House 
Appropriations Committee has pro- 
posed a phase-out of the Health 
Education Assistance Loan 
Program (HEAL) for students 
studying for health professions. 
Loans to students now in the pro- 
gram would be phased out by fiscal 
year 1999, with no loans to new 
students." 

• "House and Senate 
Republicans proposed capping the 
Federal Direct Student Loan 
Program at 40 percent of new bor- 
rowing Currently, the program is 
scheduled to expand to 60 percent 
of new borrowing by 1998 In a 
July press conference, House 
Republicans announced they now 
seek to climiatte the direct lending 
program entirely." 

In addition lo the raid on loans

dial allow student activity fees to be 
used to fund campus-based groups 
involved in activities aimed at 
"influencing public policy." Nice 
touch. This campus gag rule would 
ensure that IPFW's student govern- 
ment, and any student groups it 
funds, must remain silent while 
Soudcr &amp; company restrict student 
access to higher education 

Here at IPFW. however, such a 
gag rule would seem a bit pointless. 
Al Souder's appearance, sponsored 
by the Allen County Young 
Republicans, about 30 people 
showed up, mostly Party stalwarts 
and right-wing conspiracy nuts 
Perhaps a third of those in atten- 
dance were opponents of Souder's 
legislative priorities. There were 
few IPFW students and the only 
faculty member I noticed was a guy 
more right-wing than Souder, who 
ran against him in the Republican 
primary. Much of the meeting con- 
sisted of Souder's tiresome spiel, in 
which he displayed rudimentary 
creativity with his rationalizations 
about how cuts are not really cuts. 

During the question and convo- 
luted answer period. I intended to 
grill Souder on his votes to cut edu- 
cation funds, but he jerked my 
chain on a different issue, which we 
haggled over, and I didn't get 
another chance to question him on 
what it seemed to me. should be a 
central issue on our campus. Oh 
well The freshmen, sophomores 
and juniors out there will bear the 
additional loan costs and loss of 
grants, if Souder and his congres- 
sional cronies get their way, not 
me. If those students don't care, 
why should I? After the spring 
semester, I'm out of here anyway. 
Good luck, to the rest of you.

Letters to the Editor 



Not only gays offended by homophobia 



To Ihe editor; 

This letter is in response to com- 
ments made in Paul Tupper's col- 
umn. Gay-ly Forward, which 
appeared in the September 28, 1995 
issue of The Communicator While 
discussing a shirt with a homopho- 
bic slogan on it that was worn by 
another student, Paul slated, " As it 
was gays this particular shin was 
bashing, it went unnoticed." Excuse 
me? On what grounds was this false 
assumption made? Jusl because one 
does not confront someone who is 



wearing an offensive shin, does not 
mean that one has not noticed it, 
nor does it mean that one is not 
offended by it. Silence does not 
neccssariry mean consent. 

While discussing the homopho- 
bic slogan on a shirt worn by the 
lead singer of a band, Paul staled 
thai, "over ten percent of the popu- 
lation" had been offended Excuse 
me? This statement implies both 
that over ten percent of the popula- 
tion is homosexual and that only 
homosexuals are offended by 



homophobia. While I do not choose 
to debate the validity of the firsi 
implication at this particular lime, 1 
must protest the second one. One 
does not have to be a homosexual 
to be offended hy homophobia. One 
does not have to be a member of 
any targeted group to be offended 
and hurt by the haired and discrim- 
ination of that group. 
Discrimination hurts humanity as a 
whole, and all human beings are 
negatively affected by it 

Advocating for the basic human 



rights of any discriminated group is 
a worthwhile and commendable 
mission. In this particular article, 
however, I think that Paul's mission 
clouded his judgment of the issue, 
maybe next time, he could think 
before he writes.

Blacks struggle harder than gays 



I am writing this letter in 
response to Paul Tupper's column, 
Gay-ly Forward, in the September 
28. 1995. issue of The 

Communicator. 1 am happy for you, 
Mr Tupper, that you are able to 
talk about your sexuality with no 
qualms, hut I am disgusted with 
you equaling being homosexual 
with being minority. In your latest 
article you stated that if someone 
someone were to wear a shirt stat- 
ing. "Sorry N--er. white girls are 
for free men" (this little saying 
made is irrelevant considering that 
were freed over 100 years ago) that 
they would be frowned upon by 
many people on campus and you 
compared that with the shirl that 
stated "Sorry Faggot dix are for 
cbix." You assume that nobody 
frowned upon this person for wear- 
ing this shirt. Contrary to your 
belief not everyone on this campus 
is homophobic. Many people on 
this campus and in the United 
States are just as offended with 
derogatory statements made about 
homosexuals as well as if someone 
were to make a derogatory state- 
ment about someone's race, ethnici- 
ty or religion 

I admit being openly (sicl homo- 
sexual in die United States is very 
difficult, but this is something you 
choose to let people know about 
yourself, hut being a minority 
(woman, African American, 
Hispanic, Asian, etc.) is not some-

thing that a person can easily 
choose to deny if they wanted. I am 
an African -American woman and I 
am appalled that you even compare 
homosexuality with being an 
African American. A homosexual 
person can choose to leave their 
present surroundings and "go back 
in the closet" and no one would 
ever know the difference 1 cannot

Professor brings world to students 



by Janet Tobey 
Features Editor 

When Stephen Man-off was a col- 
lege student in 1969, he went to 
Germany as part of an overseas 
study program. Taking a break from 
his classes at the University of 
Marburg, he look a pilgrimage (a 
bike tnp with friends) to Italy. 

[n Florence he saw ari from the 
Renaissance, including works by 
Michelangelo- South of Rome, he 
walked through an ancient forum. 

"I was standing in the Forum 
Romanum ihat had been there for 
thousands of years... I could literally 
walk through history." said Harroff. 

Harroff, associate professor of 
Germanic languages and literatures 
at IPFW, now leaches a course 
called The Ancient World, in which 
he is able to retrace his steps, as he 
brings his students into the world of 
the Roman Empire. 

He took photographs of art and 
architecture in his travels through 
western Europe, but he did not real- 
ize then how useful the pholos 
would be 10 him later in teaching 
humanities courses. 

In fact, Harroff did not expect to 
become a teacher or college profes- 
sor when he was an undergraduate 
sludent. He planned to go 10 medical 
school. The experience in Europe 
profoundly affected the rest of his 
life. He changed his major from 
biology to German in the middle of 
his senior year. 

"I had found something that I 



loved, and I have loved it for 26 Harroff's office on campus 

years now. 1 don't regret for a filled with samplings of the 

moment that I did it. 

There was a major 

shift in my life, and I 

had to pay attention 

to it," he said. 

He tells this anec- 
dote to his students 
as a way to illustrate 
that '"change can be 
good if you react to 
it in a proactive 
way." 

This is Harroff's 
26th year of teaching 
at IPFW He is cur- 
rently teaching a 
beginning German 
course and a course 
in Literature for for- 
eign language 
majors, along with 
The Ancient World. 
He once directed the 
IU summer program 
in Graz. Austria 
Through the humani- 
ties courses, which 
he helped develop, 
he finds joy in shar- 
ing with his students Stephen Harroff. associate professor of Ge

One value he shares with people 
of cultures less hectic than our own 
is the importance of keeping in con- 
nexion with the cycles of nature. An 
example of pulling this value into 
practice, he said, is his early morn- 
ing ritual. 



It is important for me to watch 
sun nse, because it puts me in 

1 touch with some- 
thing beyond 
myself that is 
always there, thai is 
eternal." said 
Harroff, 
It is also a time 
for him to think, he 
said. Recently he 
has been pondering 
the question. "How 
can we transcend 
the circumstances 
we are given in 
lifer- 
Last February, 
exploratory surgery 
revealed that 
Harroff has bladder 
cancer, He finds it a 
constant struggle 
but said he feels 
'pretty well most of 
the time." 

"It makes me feel 
good that I am able 
to come back and 
leach." Hanoff said. 
Harroff said the 
experience of bat- 
tling cancer has 
caused him to focus 
more on personal projects and on 
doing things that renew his energy, 
such as spending time in the moun- 
tains and trout fishing. Harroff 
laughs that he has never actually 
caught a trout but loves the art of 
casting the line "in a beautiful way if 



possible." 

"Rather than making grand plans, 
I'm trying to eke out more enjoy- 
ment m every day." he said, adding 
that changing his pace is hard for 
him. 

One thing that keeps him going, 
Harroff said, is support from family 
and friends. 

"My friends here at the 
University and in my religious group 
and in my family have reached out 
and supported me in a way that I am 
really ihankfut for," he said. 

Another thing that keeps him 
looking forward to each day is his 
love of leaching. 

"I really care about the things I 
teach. I care about these artifacts of 
world civilization 1 am always 
learning something about life... and I 
learn from my students," said 
Hanoff. 

Perhaps his favorite "artifact" is a 
photo of his wife and himself on 
their wedding day. He keeps the 
photo on his wall next to the picture 
of Earth. 

"Our relationship has always 
strengthened me and stimulated me." 
Harroff said. "My wife and I are 
soul mates. When I look at this 
photo, 1 feel all is right with ihe 
world." 



Single parent finds 
life a juggling act

Staff Writer 



"Whai 



! Whaa " It's three 

o'clock in the morning. My daugh- 
ter is awake, demanding a bottle. I 
reach for her bottle, which I discov- 
er is empty. I struggle to the kitchen 
for some formula Back in the bed- 
room. 1 pick her up. praying that 
she will go back to sleep. 

It doesn't work; she is not 
sleepy. She needs to be 
changed. I look at the clock. 
Four more hours until it's ' 
time to pack the diaper bag, 
make the bottles, bathe her, dress 
her and get my daughter settled 
into child-care. 

After 1 take care of all of m; 
daughter's needs in the morning, I 
have only a few minutes to throw 
on something presentable and to 
brush my teeth. Seconds later, I am 
standing at the bus stop waiting to 
go to school. 

No one has to tell me that being 
a single teenage mom is difficult- I 
live that difficult life everyday, I 
am torn between classes, doctor 
appointments, studying and resl. 
Twenty four hours never seems like 
quile enough time to accomplish 
everything. 

Nine months into my pregnancy. 
I was convinced that education 
would be my only way out of what 
could be a bad situation. I needed to 
provide a future, not only for 
myself but for a daughter who 
would depend upon me for her 
every need. 1 completed my GED, 



placement tests and SAT. all in one 
month. 

Now I am attending IPFW and, 
like many other women, 1 know 
what it is like to 
be a student and 
a mom at the 
: time. 

There 
are 




nights 
my daughter 
sleeps on my lap while I prepare 
my speeches for speech class, I 
have been known to lake my alge- 
bra book into the tub with me. Once 



in the tub. 1 try to relax and figure 
out the solutions to my algebra 
problems. Other nights I fall asleep 
with my history book on my chest. 

Mothers who are continuing 
their education are faced with 
obstacles everyday When my 
daughter fell extremely sick the day 
before an important test, I was 
faced with a nine o'clock doctor's 
appointment and an eleven o'clock 
class. How I ever pulled that one 
off still boggles my mind. I have 

my fingers crossed that I passed. 

I am making it, as any mom could. 

It takes a whole lot of patience, 

lime management and hard work, 
but maybe this excerpt, from the 
poem entitled "Single Parent's 
Prayer." could help: "Lord, grant 
me time enough to do all the 
chores, join in the games, help with 
the lessons, say all the night 
prayers, and still have a few 
left for me."

Recycling on campus: 

Students want more opportunities 
for conservation 



by Andrew Yoder 
Stafr Writer 

A lone figure sneaks nut of the 
shadows behind Kciiler Mall and 
stealthily makes her way into Ihc 
building and up to the second floor, 
She clutches a small, cylin- 
drical object stuffed deep 
into her overcoat. After a 
furtive glance around to 
make sure (he coasl is clear, 
Ihe mystery woman 
approaches a nondescript 
cardboard box and quickly 
places the object inside the 
box After another glance 
around she hurriedly exits 
the scene. 

What you just witnessed 
was a member of a minority 
group here on campus recy- 
cling a soda can She is a 
minority because of the fact 
that she and only a select 
group of other students have 
working knowledge of the 
recycling program 

For the record, there is a 
significant recycling pro- 
gram in effect at IPFW, 
employing office waste recy- 
cling as well as aluminum 
can and bond paper recy- 
cling receptacles. The loca- 
tions of many of these recep- 



machines. They arc sponsored by complaints, by far. have been from 



and benefit various organizations, 
such as the Biology Club. 

The bond paper recycling recep- 
tacles are large, blue plastic con- 
tainers. They are located in the aca- 
demic buildings in various ball-

majority of the student body 

way; 

Numerous students voiced com- 
plaints about the small scope of the 
IPFW recycling program. Some 
complained of the lack of advertis- 
ing of the program, others about the 
lack of receptacles in clase proxim- 
ity to major student pathways and lion. Happy recycling. 



(based on a semi-random, semi- 
accurate survey) and this fact caus- 
es no end of frustration for IPFW 
students. 

The aluminum can recycling 
containers, which vary in color, 
size and material can be found in 
most of the academic buildings in 



students who say they just do not 
know enough about the recycling 
program to participate in it. 

One IPFW student, Emily 

Osbun, said she would be more 

likely to take part in recycling if 

there were more receptacles, 

Contrary to popular belief, 

students' opinions do make a 

difference, at least in matters 

of conservation. 

According to Frank 
Borelli. vice chancellor of 
student affairs, it was Ihe 
students who originally 
brought recycling to the 
IPFW campus IPFW's recy- 
cling program began as a 
result of student initiatives 
requesting that the Canteen, 
the food service company, 
choose products that are 
recyclable. 

Borelli. who is "100 per- 
cent in favor" of an aggres- 
sive conservation program, 
also stated that student prod- 
ding set in motion the idea 
of paper bins on campus for 
recycling. 

IPFW students, most of 
whom claimed to recycle at 
least one item each day. say 
thai they care enough to be 
interested in a better conser- 
vation program on campus. 
The question seems to be 
whether or not students are willing 
to take the time to get involved and 
make something happen. As the 
existing program demonstrates, 
with enough persistence, student 
action and interests are recognized 
and embraced by the adminisira- 



close proximity to the soda congregation areas. The most vocai

by Jane! Tohey 
Features Editor 

Students who are building tbeir 
skills in writing and researching 
have an opportunity to go high-tech 
in a class offered during the spring 
semester. 

Every student who enrolls in the 
class, Electronic Sources for 
Reporters, will receive his or her 
own Internet account, according to 
Ann Colbert, journalism program 
coordinator 

'The focus is on introducing stu- 
dents to the Internet and the use of 
data bases and other electronic 
tools for reporting," said Colbert, 
"Students will be issued a VAX 
account which will allow them 10 
do Internet surfing." 

Colbert said the class is not pri- 
marily a computer class. Students 
who are curious about using the 
Internet need to be aware that Ihey 
will be required to perform written 



assignments 

"The writing assignments will 
be geared toward a combination of 
on-line and news sources," said 
Colbert 

The class will be a good intro- 
duction to using the Internet, 
according to Colbert. The sources 
are helpful for many types of 
research. 

The pre-rcquisite for the class is 
six credit hours in Journalism

limiirr (/« SUatfurs 



( triginally, I h:id no plans "f pining ihc media cir- 
cus surrounding the O.J. Simpson trial I had my 
views, much like all of America, but I hesitated to 
cnlighien the masses with my two cents, Then, the 
verdict was announced, and all hctl broke lose. 
Like a fesienng boil, my frustration built up and 
finally exploded. I am joining the circus, for belter 
or worse 

Last week when the verdict was announced, noi 
a seal was lo be had near any of a number of televi- 
sions around campus. The sidewalks were virtually 
deserted at noontime, usually a busy lime across 
campus. Everyone, including myself, was in.no! 
by ihc impending news. And then ii happened; the 
verdict of "not guilty" was announced by the jury 
forewoman. It was as if a bomb bad exploded. No 
"" "" one could believe what had happened. 
To be honest, 1 fell a pride in America well within my soul. I was over- 
joyed with the outcome. Now, before you grab that pen and write (o tell me 
what an idiot I am, consider the facts. The prosecution blew this case, plain 
and simple. If you are upset at the world and disillusioned by the American 
judicial system, blame Marcia Clark and her merry band of cronies. Do noi 
blame the judicial system because Simpson was found not guiliy. The jury 
did not say he did noi commit the crime: they did not say be killed his ex- 
wife and Ron Goldman Simply, the jury considered the evidence present- 
ed by both Ihc prosecution and the defense and made a rational judgment. 
Like it or noi, there was reasonable doubi as to whether or not Simpson 
could be placed at the murder scene. Thus, the jury opted for a not guilty 
verdict, and Simpson was released. 

After viewing the proceedings of the announcement, I ventured across 
campus io get a feci of what students were saying and what the 
' general aura of the people was like I was amazed by the heat that 
seemed to permeate every nook and cranny of our beloved cam- 
pus. The university is supposed lo be a free-thinking, open- 
minded environment that fosters learning. That is pre- 
cisely why the ignorant comments I overheard as I 
ambled from building to building upset me lo such 
a degree. Sadly, there were many more students, 
' faculty and staff who were upsci by the decision 
than those elated because the system had proven 
itself to be operational. 

One of the most uninformed utterances I heard 

came from a young woman as she spoke vio- 

, — . lently with her friend Realize here, the age 

\\y w and gender of the person to whom I refer is 

^i unimportant. The words she spoke represent 

}i the stale of mind Ihc general public has 

adopted. The young woman lold her friend 

she was so incensed by the jury' s decision that 

she had a headache. Then, words of complete 

ignorance escaped her lips, 'This jusl lells every 

man that he can get so upset with his wife thai he 

can go ahead and butcher her and he won't get 

o trouble!" Oh, brother here we go.. 

Now, I am no expert on the O.J. triai. I doubt 

[ us are unless we actually spent nine 

months as a member of the jury. There is one thing 

however that I do know for sure. Here is a case thai 

captivated America for the better pan of a year. It 

was an event so big lhat it often over-shadowed 

many of the "real" problems of our culture 

When ii was finally over, it left a void in the 

minds and viewing habits of the public. Maybe

that Is precisely why so many are upsei? 

I do not claim io have all of the answers, hut 1 am full of questions, I am 
not wondering about the trial, there is no use gelling into thai subject. Lei 
us allow sleeping dogs to lie My questions arc for you Are you arc pissed 
off ai America and angry lhat Simpson received "preferential treatment" 
because of his economic siaius? Do you still find it hard to live with the 
verdict? Do you conslantly express your disbelief and disappointment in 
the jury's verdict? 

If you answered. "Yes." to these questions, would you rather live in a 
society where, just on the basis of suspicion you can be caned off to prison 
without a trial by jury, Do you desire a society lhat fails lo recognize Ihc 
individual freedoms of an individual? If so, I'll be ihc first to pitch in for 
your plane ticket out of America. Hell. I will even pack your bags! 
Personally. 1 am proud lo be an American, noi because OJ. Simpson was 
declared not guilty by a panel of 12 people in Los Angeles, bul because I 
have the personal liberty to feel as I do about such topics as the "Trial of 
the Ceniury" and express those opinions in a medium such as ihc one you 
are holding right now I am proud and thankful lhat I was blessed by being 
bom inio a society where, although life is noi always what some people 
call fair, al least I am free to express my displeasure or delight Take it as 
you will. . just remember, the view from under Ihe bleachers is not always 
a pretty one.

by Jim Porter 
Sports Editor 

Have you ever wondered what 
running eight kilometers feels like? 
If so, pose Ihe question io senior, 
Jason Douglas. Douglas, who is Ihc 
leading runner on ihc men's cross 
country team, regularly competes at 
the eight kilometer distance. He 
usually finishes the course in the 
top 20. 

"Running consistent splits and 
having a race plan before going into 
the race is the key." said Douglas 

Douglas seems to have his con- 
sistency and race plan down pat. 
However, (hat was not the case last 
year. Last season Douglas was rcd- 
shined after sustaining a stress frac- 
ture in his leg. 

"A lot of rest is all that the doc- 
tors could prescribe It took about 
three months before 1 could run 
without any pain," he said. 

It was a long road back for the 
senior radiography student who 
learned lo love running at an early 
age. 

"In ihe sixth grade I found oui I 
could compete with the rest of the 
kids in my class. Then, in the sev- 
enth grade I realized I was good. 
Not to brag or anything, but I was 
excelling and siuck with ii," said 



Douglas. 

With a large amount of parental 
support. Douglas has enjoyed his 
running career thus Tar It is a part 
of his life he plans io continue for 
quite some time. 

"I will dcfinitly continue until 
my legs tell me otherwise," said 
Douglas, 

Douglas' class schedule pro- 
hibits him from running in events 
other than collcgiaic invitalionals. 

"I plan on running road races if 
for nothing more than to keep in 
shape. Not too soon though, I've 
got to get lhat academic thing going 
so I can get ajob." Added Douglas. 

Douglas says that his individual 
success can be attributed to ihe suc- 
cess of his teammates Running 
with the guys keeps him focused, 
according to Douglas 

"Without them [teammates 
Adam Barton and David Foote], It 
would he difficult lo finish where I 
have, running with them helps out a 
lot," said Douglas. 

He says lhat one of these days he 
would also like to compete in a 
marathon "If nothing else just to 
compeie." said Douglas. "Running 
can be discouraging, but the 
rewards are greater than you can 
ever imagine."

Don's duo among best in defensive category 




Senior Healher Teagarden tallies one of her 991 career digs in lasl 
week's malch in Northern Kentucky. 



by Jim Porter 
.Sports Editor 

Despite a lack of intensity at 
times and the possibility that 1PFW 
will not host ibe conference tourna- 
ment, two women's volleyball play- 
ers have achieved individual great- 
ness Junior Julie Parrot and senior 
Healher Teagarden moved 10 num- 
ber two and three respectively on 
the team's all-time digs list. Parrot 
currently has 1,056 digs in her 
career. Teagarden, who also ranks 
number two on the all-time kills 
list, currently stands at 991 digs in 
her career 

Parrot, a 5' 8" outside hitter, 
has tallied 277 thus far Oils season 
and could break the all-time record. 
held by Joni Smith who played 
from 1985-1988. Parrot has aver- 
aged almost 390 digs in her first 
two seasons with the Dons and 
could break the all-time record late 
this season or early next season. 

"Obviously, I hope that I can be 
first on the list, both for the team 



and myself," said Parrot. 

The dig is a defensive play thai 
keeps a hard-hit ball, usually a kill 
attempt, in play. Il gives the team a 
chance to cither score a point or 
gain a sidcoul Parrot said that she 
sees defense as the most important 
pan of her game. 

"I've always felt like I have to 
compensate defensively, especially 
last year and the year before. I'm 
not one to gel a lot of kills like 
Healher (Teagarden) or Amber 
(Borne)," said Parrot. 

"Individual defense is basically 



desire. It is a hard nose altitude," 
said the Volleydon's head coach 
Tim llcffron. 

Parrot, a psychology major, 
thinks that her studies have aided 
her both on and off of ihc court. 

"Menially I know thai my stud- 
ies have helped. 1 can work belter 
under pressure," she added 

Teagarden is viewed as a hard- 
nosed player who plays with a reck- 
less abandon. She and Parrol go 
after balls thai other players are not 
willing to chase. 

"1 think it has a lot io do with the

kill past me," said Teagarden. 

Working and achieving success 
under pressure is exactly how 
Parrol likes lo play Ihe game, loo. 
She views her role this season as a 
leader on a team thai has many 
capable leaders. 

"1 think that I am one of the 
players thai, along with Heather 
ITeagarden], has to stabilize the 
team, especially during crunch situ- 
ations," said Parrot, 

Though she is disappointed wilh 
the recenl play of the team. Parrot 
still sees a glimmering light at Ihc 
end of thai proverbial tunnel 

"'Hopefully we can still host the 
conference tournament. If wc can 
ail give 1 10 percent both physically 
and menially the winning will lake 
care of itself," said Parrot.
