Maurice Shady. IPFW police Chief. 

A more in-depth survey Is in the 
works, but some changes arc already 
in e(f«l. Shady said. 

One of Ihe changes is the gradual 
phasing our of AH parking areas. "We 
are trying lo gel away from AH parking 
because it is jusl loo confusing,'' said 
Shady "Evenlually it will be cither A 
parking or B parking." 

Another major change was the 
elimination of 25 student parking 
spaces in lot II. located between Nelf 
Hall and Building D, and their 
replacement as 'acuity parking spaces.

Shady insists that Ihe move will 
benefit bolh (acuity and students. Many 
faculty and slarr members, who 
originally occupied offices In either 
Keltler Hall cir one ol Ihe lour trom 
buildings, were recently moved inlo

parking spaces soon developed in lot 11, 

Campus police officers also noticed 
an increase in empty parking sp-iei.-, in 
lot 7, located just east of Kclller Hall 

Shady'sspot checks suggest that 25 B 
parking spaces from lot II be switched 
with Ihe same amounl ol A parking

"B parkers won't lose any parking

Dcbra Grimm, counselor 
for the disabled, said she 
plans to look into sports 
programs for disabled 
students at olhiT universities 

tiviliis IPFW could offer lis 
handicapped students. 

John P. Ulmcr, dean of 
Student Services, said the 

par course for disabled 
students is on the Chan- 
cellor's Advisory Corn- 



priority 

The Communicator agrees 
with the committee that the 
library endowment Is im- 
portant because it can help 
all students, however, the 
committee should slick with 
the parcourse idea and see it 



Just because a person i&lt;

people enjoy. Making 
campuses accessible and 
providing sports programs 
helps a world made for able- 
bodied people become more 
livable tor the disabled.

Winter is also Ihe best 
time to run. according to 
Dave Falrchild. IPFW 



"During the week," he 
said, "I'll run one long run 
of about l5-20miles and two 
speed runs of about 1 miles. 
The rest ol the week I'll do 
whatever lwanl." 

Falrchild said he runs
