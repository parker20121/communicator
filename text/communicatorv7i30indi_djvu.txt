Free Folk, sack Shreve 

on Wednesday, April 27. 
e passage of Bill 767710, which 
demanded recall of Bills 1 through 8, dealing with the (140,000 student activities 

The purpose given for the recall of the budget was twofold; to force the 
administration to see Th.it the ch.irRcs against student Mike Folk were dropped, 
and to ask for disciplinary action against officer Mike Shreve, the campus 
policeman who arrested Folk Folk was charf

The executive and legislative branches of students' government joined hands 
in forcing the issue to a head. Student body president Mlkfi Hennann acted as 
spokesman lor a ((.■legation that met with James Thatcher. Vice-chancellor ol 
Business Affairs, yesterday in his office. The dele^itmn included student body 
vice president Mars Paige 'Jrein and eleven of the fourteen student senators. 

The Communicator regrets the necessity for action by students' government. 
In attempting to placate an already ridiculous situation, one thai should have been 
handled nihTiialh tc. Ihe univm iiy. Hi- actions ol students' govenunenf may 
IMissil.lv Inn c In m an ovei reaction, jusi as Shreve over-reacted when he arrested 
Folk. 

Had the charges against Folk been dropped, his arrest record erased and 
officer Shreve either dismissed or scverly reprimanded, the actions of students' 
government would not have been necessary. 

We mentioned earlier that we regret the actions of students' government We 
do. But we nlso regret the delay by the administration in relieving Folk of the 
pressure of an unjust arrest , ami we also see no place for an officer on the campus 
police force with Die over-bearing attitude ol Mike Shreve. 

We have investigated Shreve F.ven if the incident involving Folk were an 
isolated one, the administration should have disciplined him, and taken steps to 
prevent such incidents in the future However, we have uncovered and documented 
three separate and unrelated incidents involving Shreve that imply he feels, 
somehow, the campus belongs to him after eleven p,m. 

After all, this is a college campus The goal ol the .students at this campus is to 
learn, or at least make an effort to learn Mike Folk was doing thai The goal of all 
faculty and administators, including Ihe campus police, is to help the students 
achieve (heir goal as quickly anil completely as possible, at the convenience of the 
students. 

The 11 p.m. closing of the campus buildings is not. and should not be an 
arbitrary deadline, one that has to be adhered to at all costs, including arrest, or 
God forbid, maybe even something worse. An officer enforcing the closing tune 
simply has to show good judgement. Shreve, in at least four separate Incidents, has 
shown poor judgement Such action calls for an equal reaction. 

The Communicator supports the efforts of students' government, both for the 
complete restoration of Mike Folk's good name, and for the dismissal of officer 
Mike Shreve,

The gold bars 

of an Army officer... 

The earning of a second lieutenant's gold bars is a proud moment for a 
man and his family. They represent not iust the symbol of his achievement 
and rank, but also his responsibility. 

That responsibility is to lead. And today, in an Army of better educated 
and highly motivated young men and women, the demands on a young officer 
are tougher than ever. 

You not only have to manage people, but money and materials as well. To 
make more important planning decisions than most young executives. 

The need for such people is one reason why Army ROTC is offered to 
veterans at hundredsof colleges and universities. The acquired disciplines of 
mind and spirit, and the ability to perform under pressure, are important to 
us. The people who demonstrate these qualities are the people we want to 
become Army officers. 

The benefits are as great as the demands. Scholarship opportunities. 
Practical experience as a leader and a manager. And a monthly subsistence 
allowance of $100 a month for up to 20 months during your last two years of 
college. 

So if you're thinking of taking Army ROTC, what we offer has to be 
weighed carefully against what we expect in return. A man or woman who is 
ready to serve as an Army officer. And be worthy of the gold bars. 

For details, see your academic advisor or contact Maior Dick Reinholtz 
in Room 288F Neff Hall or call 482-5416.
