Help for the future 



By Doote Miller 
Chief Reporter 



Next Spring will mark the 
Fifteenth Anniversary of the Honors 
I'rogram at IPFW The very first 
Honors class was H106 and was 
taught by Clifford H. Scott, who is 
still teaching at IPFW 

With such a considerable histo- 
ry, why isn't more known about the 
Honors Program? Actually, the 
answer to that probably lies in the 
general population's idea of what 
"honors" means in the secondary 
school years IPFW's meaning is 
quite removed from those days of 
extra work and little fun. 

"It is not about more work, but 
about enjoying intellectual discus- 
sion. That old connotation is a 
myth," said Matthew Kubik, profes- 
sor of architectural engineering 
technology and director of the hon- 
ors program. 

"Students think that honors 
classes are harder than others. . they 
are not about more paperwork, and 
tests. It's about a partnership in 
learning (between students and fac- 
ulty)," said Kubik "It concerns 
experiential learning instead of a 
lecture style class They are interac- 
tive,"

Honors Program, does that mean 
more classes to graduate, degree 
requirements and honors courses? 
That is not true either 

"It's important that students 
don't have to take extra classes. 
Students can use honors classes to 
fulfill general education require- 
ments," said Kubik 

Even with the changes, it still 
seemed as if the Honors Program 
was focused solely on academia. In 
light of that concern, the Honors 
Program developed a series of activ- 
ities so that students and faculty 
could meet in a casual atmosphere. 

These gatherings are formally 
called the "Honors Lunch Table," 
which meets on Wednesdays until 
Nov. 19, from noon to 1 p.m. 
Participants meet at the Walb 
Student Union Cafeteria east win- 
dow dining area. 

An Honors Gymnasium will be 
held on Monday until Nov 24, from 
2 p.m. until 3 p.m. The Gymnasium 
takes place at the Gates Athletic 
Center in the Royal Dons Room. It 
offers Honors sludenls a chance to 
participate in fitness activities in a 
non -threatening environment. 

Kubik, who is in his second year 
as director o[ the program, stresses 
that the Honors Program is not an 
exclusive club. 

"It is important that the Honors 
Program be available to all stu-

Tutors, writing 
center serve students 



By Susan Spindler 
News Editor 

With this semester fully under 
way some students will find them- 
selves looking for assistance with 
their courses. Well look no further. 
Transitional Studies and the Writing 
Center are here to serve you. 

Transitional Studies is the place 
lo go for tutors. There are many 
tutors available for different sub- 
jects at various limes. 

"We try and get every subject that 
is requested." said Greg Anderson 
developmental skills specialist. "It 
doesn't always work out but we try 
lo accommodate every student." 

To locale a tutor go to Ketder 
Rm 202 Find the notebook that has 
the course your looking for, flip 
through until you find a tutor that 
will be available. Then get in con- 
tact with that person to set up tunes 
lo meet 

If the course is not listed as hav- 
ing tutors available, get in touch 
with Transitional Studies and they 
will help find a tutor. 

Another place to go for assistance 
is the Wriung Center, which is 
located in Kettler G35. This is the 
place to improve writing skills, not 
the place to get a paper written. The

dents," said Kubik. "A personal goal 
is to ensure the Honors Program is 
available to all majors like pre-med, 
nursing and business. So those stu- 
dents have the opportunity to take 
great classes wiih excellent profes- 
sors." 

Even students not enrolled in the 
Honors Program can lake the class- 
es but they have to have the profes- 
sor's signature Classes arc limited 
lo 20 students and are being taught 
by the best faculty ai IPFW, Kubik 
remarked. 

New this semester, Honors stu- 
dents will have registration priority 
This means thai they can register on 
Oct. 20. Kubik stresses thai individ- 
uals must be pan of the Honors 
Program in order lo be eligible II is 
not too late, just fill out an applica- 
tion and return it to the office. There 
are 1000 students who are eligible 
but only a fraction are members of 
the program. 

Furthering the educational lives 
of honors students is obviously 
important to IPFW because there is 
a library lable reserved for honors 
students. It is a study table located in 
the northeast comer on the ground 
floor behind the reference books. 

The Honors Program strives to 
be more than stuffy academics. It is 
an interdisciplinary organisation in 
which students team by doing. 



Writing Center offers free, one-to- 
one help with all aspects of a paper. 
They answer questions, help ana- 
lyze the purpose and audience of the 
paper and will assist in generating 
and organizing ideas 

Although, they do not edit or 
proofread papers, they will help 
with learning strategies for more 
effective writing. 

Appointments are not necessary, 
but strongly recommended. Now 
thai the year is in full swing il could 
be difficult to walk in and receive 
the advice needed. 

"We have seen 215 students ibis 
year," said Ezekiel Vitansi, interim 
director of the Writing Center. 

To make an appointment sign 
your name on the bulletin board out- 
side of Kettler G35. If the appoint- 
. ment needs to be canceled, ctoss 
your name off at least one hour 
before the scheduled appointment 

These two services are available 
[o students who are looking for aca- 
demic help, and both are free. The 
hours of the Writing Center vary 
throughout the week Check the bul- 
letin board outside Kettler G35. 

The hours of Transitional 
Studies are 8 a.m lo 8 p.m , 
Monday- Thursday and 8 am. to 5 
p.m. on Fridays.

Another beauty queen from Canada has lost her crown. This will be 
the second dethroned queen this year for Canada. 

Apparently, Gabnella Peuvoky breached her contract when she 
accepted a job with Hooters, the United States restaurant chain. 

The Organizers of the Miss Canadian International pageant said 
Petivoky breached her contract when she posed for promotional photos 
in a tank lop with "Hooters" inscribed across her chest. 

The issue has raised questions as to whether or not Petivoky should 
lose her crown due to her new job. 

Canadians aren't sure if second besl should continue lo come out on 
top 

They also aren't that bothered by Petivoky's job choice, if that is 
what she wants to do.

Wake up, become 
more than just a student 



Wc believe college 
opportunity nol only lo 
build a student's knowl- 
edge, but it is also an opportunity to 
meet other students who can widen 
one's perspective. We are tired of 
walking on campus in a vacuum. 
IPFW is a commuter campus, but 
lhat is no excuse for the majority of 
students to behave as if they were 
the only person here 

They seem to ibink they have 
the only keys to success, but many 
of these students ^»__™.^™ 
have forgotten the ~~ ~ ~ !* 
Golden Rule. We all 
forget it from time 
to lime, but it's 
practically void here 
on campus. 

Often, when we 
encounter a fellow 
student who may 
have been in one of 
our classes last 
semester, we expect 
some acknowledg- 
ment, some hint of 



welcome or some — ^— ^^^— 
eye contact, but this rarely happens. 
It is easier for two acquaintances to 
look away deliberately than to make 
some effort to say, "Hello " 

No one here wants to take a risk, 
ever Students become oblivious to 
everything that doesn't affect them 
personally. It is like high school 
here. 

We know some commute from 
of town and some come from Fort 
Wayne. We know college is hard and 
we all go through the same strug- 
gles, the same goals. We should be 
able to rely on each other a bit more 
and try to get through this together 



No one can really go through the 
process of college and make it with- 
out depending on others. What a 
waste it is for these robotic students 
to not want to share their personali- 
ties Do students here still have 
them? 

Oh, we know students claim 
they do not have time lo be human 
now and again. When a student 
drops a book or stumbles down the 
staircase in Kcttler, hardly anyone 
cares to help that person Many of 
— „^ H us have distanced 
" ' ourselves from 
society and do 
enj o y this 
lifestyle to some 
extent. 

We know 
students here are 
not robots, but 
why do they act 
like it? We are 
aware most stu- 
dents here work 
and attend classes 
but that is no rea- 



Students become 

oblivious to 

everything that

personally. 



^^^^^^^^™ son nol to take the 
time to get to know the warm body 
sitting next to you. And yes. many 
people here already have friends but 
they stop there Ever hear the 
expression, from the Girl Scouts 
"keep your friends, gold and silver 
too"? 

When students graduate from 
this campus they may nol be able to 
communicate well with others who 
are unfamiliar or who are not in the 
same circle of friends. 

If this would change on campus 
there may be a possiblily working 
together to end other problems on 
campus 



Albert becomes human 



One of the most recognizable 
voices in sports has been silenced. 
Marv Albert will no longer be heard 
saying "From downtown, Yes!" 

The MSG network, which airs 
New York Knicks and Ranger 
games, and NBC, fired Albert after 
he pleaded down to misdemeanor 
assault He did this to avoid embar- 
rassing his family and to avoid con- 
viction of felony sodomy. 

When Albert was first accused 
of these charges, we were skeptical 
because of bis respected status. He 
denied the charges while bis family 
and fiancee stood by him 

As more information about bis 
accuser surfaced, we doubted the 
validity of ber story because of ber 
record with other men who have 
broken up with ber She deposited 
semen in her panties and allegedly 
paid someone S50K to testify 
against Albert 

We came to believe Albert's 
accuser when another witness testi- 
fied that Albert attacked her She 
freed herself by pulling off Albert's 
toupee. Immediately, Albert stopped 
his attack to replace his hairpiece 



The vanity he showed in lhat inci- 
dent was very telling and human 
Albert ceased to be an alleged sexu- 
al deviant but rather a pathetic, 
humiliated man who valued his ego 
more than his libido. 

There is so much wrought irony 
in this case, we cannot begin to fath- 
om it, If Albert were a professional 
sports figure, be would be back on 
the field in weeks He would have to 
undergo therapy and pay a large 
fine, but it would be forgotten. 
Michael Irvin. Dwigbt Gooden. 
Daryl Strawberry and Sieve Howe 
all prove this point. No one even 
remembers lose Canseco's battery 
case. Mike Tyson was convicted of 
rape and fougbi for millions after his 
release 

These scandals were all forgot- 
ten as will Albert's America has 
Attention Deficit Disorder As soon 
as the nexl big case comes along, he 
will be back page news. If you want 
proof, remember Princess Diana a 
few weeks ago? Where was she dur- 
ing the Albert trial? At peace, final- 
ly- 




Discrimination goes unchecked on campus 



To THE editor: 

I am responding to ihe issues 
raised concerning institutionalised 
discrimination. I too must speak to 
the reality of marginalizaiion. the 
challenges of multiculturalism, and 
the need for a protective, jusi admin- 
istrauon. I know discrimination is a 
problem at IPFW Indeed, from the 
qualify education IPFW offers, I 
have studied both the detrimental 
effects of exclusion and the academ- 
ic richness of true diversity. 
Unfortunately, some faculty have 
yet to be educated or choose to 
express disrespectful, hurtful, and 
prejudiced attitudes and bebavior 
towards minority students. As a 
community of academics, we might 
expect change to come through edu- 
cation. We mighl consider ourselves 
leaders in educational example and 
excellence. We might imagine that 
the administration would insist upon 
ensuring students' educational 
rights When I look upon IPFW 
administrators 1 am aware of people 
with character and respect for our 
university. Yet, as an institution of 
higher education the actions of the 
administrators fail to uphold equal 
opportunity: rather, students are 



silenced. 

I personally know of a student 
who, attempting lo have a discrimi- 
nation grievance resolved, was told 
that if the grievance was pursued the 
student's "future academic career 
would be in jeop- „^^^^^^ 
ardy." The fol- 
lowing semester, 
after the student 
pursued resolu- 
tion, the student's 
instructors were 
asked in letters 
(written by the 
person who'd 
made Ihe threat) 
to rcpori any 



"abrasiv 
"falsely accusing" 



behavior &lt; 



the 



students part 
Needless to say, 
the grievance has 
yet to be resolved 

■\nd the students , . - 

academic career 
is indeed in jeopardy — despite the 
student's having received honors. 
dean's list recognition, listing in the 
National Dean's List, a literature 
award, a diversity award, and publi- 
cation as an undergraduate in such 



outstanding journals as The Iowa 
Review and Sinister Wisdom — all 
of which reflects the character of the 
student and the quality of education 
at IPFW 

Why then is a quality universi-

and destructive need to win. indicat- 
ing the emphasis of their concern 
lies outside the goal of stopping dis- 
crimination Or perhaps winning is 
the goal of Purdue, IPFW's boss. 



Perhaps the emphasis is on mone 
rather than people Perhaps Purdi 
fails to reward integrity in its admin- 
istrators, or acts as a bully, maintain- 
ing inequality and resisting change, 
We might consider that the dircciot 
of Purdue's affirmative action prevt 
gram filed a civil rights complaint 
August 28, 1997. alleging Purdue 
harassed him after he recorrVfn ended 
disciplinary action against staff fojr, 
discrimination Must equality comu 
down to intimidation, a matter of 
attorneys, money, and fighting with- 
in a facade through which students 
the university has honored are then 
discounted and disbelieved? I chal- 
lenge each of our administrators to 
go borne this evening and consider 
what it means to represent IPFW 
and to stand for education; lo con- 
sider, as I am, what it means to 
honor our university and what it 
mighl be like to dare to address. 
with due respect, the problems of 
discrimination in an educated and 
fair manner.

To the Editor: 



potential lo he edited for length, 
grammar, and style (?). It would 
seem to me that this would be to 
make the article "easier" to under- 
stand. I feel that two of the changes 
am big u- 



I wrote a letter to the editor for 
the Sept 25. 1997, issue of The 
Communicator Ihe letter was writ- 
ten in regards to Oct. 2 World Farm m m * anidc made ll 
Animals Day. a day of animal obser- 
vance. 

1 greatly appreciate your print- 
ing of my letter. For the most part, 
you relayed the original context of 
my letter quite well. I do, however, 
have some issues to bring to your 
attention that I feel are of significant 
importance. 

First of all, I didn't give a title to 
my original tetter I didn't feel that I 
needed to title my contribution 
(This idea turned out lo be a mis- 
take.) My letter was assigned an 
arbitrary title, much to my chagnn, 
by a Communicator staff member. If 
you needed a title, my phone num- 
ber and address were submitted with 
my original letter. The title. 
"Animals must be treated fairly," is 
a misrepresentation of my views 
and, aside from that, just sounds 
corny The word "must" would indi- 
cate that I'm telling everyone bow 
to live their lives. I don't embrace 
the idea of imposing my will and 
beliefs on anyone in a tyrannical 
manner. Don't get me wrong, I fully 
believe in and subscribe to many of 
the aspects of the animal rights 
movement. However, I feel thai 
overzealousness can kill a lot of 
good ideas, and Ihe word, "must," 
would indicate lhat I'm dictatonally 
attempting to regulate, lo a certain 
degree, morality and ethics. 

I realize that my letter had the 



In the Fifth paragraph, first sen- 
tence. The Communicator's version 
of my letter reads: ^^^^^^ 

"This environment 

(referring to the 
deplorable conditions 
that factory farm ani- 
mals endure. ) is a triv- 
ial appeasement of 
human palates." 

This is a gram- 
matically unclear 
interpretation of my 
statement. It would 
appear that I was say- 
ing that the environ- 
ment were appeasing 
human palates What I 
said was: " . . ani- 
mals . . . suffer ... in 
over-crowded condi- S™^ 
tions and unnatural 
surroundings, all brought upon them 
for the trivial appeasement of 
human palates." 

The final flaw in The 
Communicator's version of my let- 
ter came in the sixth paragraph. I 
was making reference lo some of 
society's norms of ihe past thai 
today most of us see as abomina- 
tions in history The Communicator 
reported lhat 1 said: "At one rime, 
our society allowed itself to enslave 
millions of people, and these acts of 
genocide against the indigenous 



people of this country were justified 
This statement was quite mis- 
construed, not only in regards to 
wbat I had originally said, but it was 
also historically fallacious as well. 
What my original letter said was: 

"At one time, our society lold us 
that it was okay to enslave millions 
of people, (and) that acts of geno- 
^^^^^^_ cide against the 

indigenous people 

of ibis country were 
justified 

I thought that it 
was clear that I was 
referring to people 
brought from Africa 
in the slavery refer- 
ence and that the 
indigenous people 
mentioned in the 
genocide example 
were the Native 
Americans. The 
Communicator ver- 
sion of my letter 
combined these two 
^— occurrences, as if 
they were one. 
The power of words is an! 
incredible thing and their use 1 
shouldn't be taken lightly. Like I 
said. I appreciate those at The 
Communicator for printing my let-; 
ter I do feel that a few of the 
changes made to my original letter 
were erroneous, unnecessary, and 
misleading. 
Thank You!

Preliminary Works in Verse and 

Prose of William Butler Yeats, II, 

preliminary poem, 1908 

It's midnight. As is the norm for 
me, I am contemplating the waning 
day by clacking mercilessly at my 
computer keyboard. However, today 
was not just a typical day. You see, 
today [ did something truly terrify- 
ing Today, folks. I quit my job 

Wan, wah, you say. Big freakin' 
deal. After nearly three years of 
loyal employment, I tendered my 
resignation and left No warnings, 
no bargaining. 1 just left. I shocked 
the hell out of everyone — especial- 
ly myself. 

1 had tried for years to enjoy my 
job. But I just couldn't. I couldn't 
stand getting up in the moming to 



face my so-called "career-path " 1 
kept telling myself that 1 just wasn't 
in the right position — that if 1 hung 
around long enough. I'd wake up 
one moming and everything would 
be beautiful, and I'd love my job 
Ccccnrraaaacccckkkk Thai's the 
sound of my rose-colored glasses 
shattering. 

Well, I finally decided today 
that my little fantasy of happiness in 
the financial world wasn't gonna 
pan out, so I walked. More like bolt- 
ed, I guess Now 1 have no place to 
go, no way to pay my bills, no 
retirement plan, nothing to do. But 1 
do have some really nice parting 
gifts. 

I was lucky to have a supervisor 
who truly wished me the best and let 
me leave with an excellent refer- 
ence The truly humorous pan is 
that she said that she could sec this 
coming, anyway — the tone of these 
columns heralded it. Dreams, 
Choices, Growing Up my topics 
here are just about my need to 
move on in all phases of my life 
Bulls-eye. 

1 had tried for too long to fight 
my old nemesis. Fate My creativi- 
ty was being stifled by a job that 
sucked the veritable life right out of 
me; writing was putting that life 



back into me It was obvious that I 
needed to move on. So move on is 
what I did. 

There are those of you who 
probably think that I did a stupid 
thing. You're shaking your heads, 
thinking, "Girl, what were you on 
when you decided this?" But. in ret- 
rospect. I think that I just made the 
smartest move of my twenties 
Hind-sight is twenty -twenty, the old 
adage goes. 

Yeah. I could have stayed with 
that job just to make my nice cushy 
little paycheck Hell, 1 had authority 
and expertise in a field that a lot of 
women aren't in. Not too shabby for 
a twenty-two year old college 
senior 

I could' ve kept doing the same 
boring job that I had for years I 
could have smiled more fake smiles 
for awhile longer to rude people 
who didn't deserve them 

There are a lot of things that I

end. There is something in this life 
that I have decided I'll never under- 
stand or be able to stomach: my sig- 
nificant other going to a strip club 

For as long as I can remember. 
the idea of any boyfriend of mine 
going out to look at other women. 
naked no less, just doesn't Ml well 
With me Although. I wish it did 
because it would make life easier at 
times. 

So last week my boyfriend went 
with his friends to one of the many 
clubs here in town It was after a 
business meeting and "all of the 
guys went" I don'l have a big prob- 
lem with him going for an hour or so 
to make an "appearance." I mean, I 
don'l want him lo say, "Oh, sorry 
guys. Susan won't let me go." I 
refuse to end up being the bitch 

But when he comes home with 
his hair all messed up, a huge grin 
on bis face, is suddenly all hoi and 
bothered and has spent a good three 
hours ogling at naked chic's. 1 tend 
to gel a little .well, bun 

With our conflicting schedules 
we don't get to see each other very 
much When be chooses to stay and 
entertain himself with these women, 
instead of coming home to spend a 
little lime with me, I have to admit, 
I do not understand When my day is 
done I don't have the desire to go 
and shove dollar bills in a stranger's 
panis I want to spend lime wilh my 
man, have dinner, watch television. 



some of my friends and most of 
them don't understand it either, 
granted a couple of them could care 
less, How I envy them A good 
fnend of mine said, "It's a man 
thing, and because it's (going to 
strip bars) considered dirty they are 
attracted to it." Okay, 1 can some- 
what buy that argument, bui n does- 
n't settle my stomach. 

What would restore my stomach 
back to normal would be if he asked 
me to "do a little dance " If thai is 
what be likes, come home! I've got 
breasts that he finds arousing and I 
would dig out those spiked heels 
from my closet, throw on a G-stnng 
and shake my money maker. In fact, 
he doesn't even need any one dollar 
bills (because I only take twenties). 

Now I have to admit I've never 
been in one of these clubs, therefore 
what really goes on in there I can not 
attest to. I know what I hear from 
guys thai frequent these places and a 
couple of the women that work 
there, but 1 don'l have any "hands- 
on" knowledge. 

Please, do not misunderstand me 
because I'm not trying lo rally 
women into bombarding the strip 
club industry or coming down on 
the male sex for enjoying this enter- 
tainment, I just don't want my 
boyfriend to overindulge himself in 
this recreation.

mer, but be. too. is a temporary 
member 

Drummer Tun would love to be 
a full-lime member of The 
Migraines but says, "1 can't play 
with them on a permanent basis 
because of my school and work 
schedule." However, he adds, "It is 
really fun." 

Lead singer and guitarist Eddie 
Migraine is understanding of Tun's 
inability to commit to The 
Migraines. 

"It is a hard thing to ask some- 
one to put their life on hold, drop 
everything, and (then) have them go 
on tour," Migraine says amicably. 

The Migraines are still in search 
of that "special" drummer who, in 
addition to being able to play as well 
as Tun. must "have his head on 
straight" While the search contin- 
ues. Migraine states, "We just use 



and abuse Tun. It'll be hard to find 
someone belter" 

Migraine fans should not be dis- 
heartened about all the changes in 
Ihe band's lineup According to 
Migraine, his drive lo continue has 
not been affected. 

"Oh no," he says. "If anything, 
it [change] has fueled the fire " 

New bassist Gee Gee is definite- 
ly carving out a niche for himself. 
When asked if it's hard becoming 
the second bassist for the 
Migraines? He says, "No, we have 
really different styles." 

The band's performance on 
SepL 20 was a mixture of many 
things II made you feel that if peo- 
ple weren't having a good time, 
maybe (here was something wrong 
with them Then when 1 found out 
that they had only bad two practices 
with the new bassisL I bad even 
more respect for iheir musicianship. 

When they performed the 
Migraine classic "Shut Up!" i! was 
great. The lyrics are simple. Bui it 



was during that song that 1 missed 
the former bassist. Jack He had 
such distinguished back-up "snarls." 
Not discrediting Gee Gee — he did 
really well — it's just thai when 
you've been hearing one guy for 
such a long lime, you get used to his 
style. 

"Shut Up!" contains dynamic 
guitar playing over typical punk 
drumming. The Migraines are a 
band that you jusl need lo see in 
order to enjoy ihe total experience. 
Audio alone won't let you lake in 
(he sight of swaying, wide-legged 
stances — nol lo mention the sight of 
Tim nonchalantly chewing gum 
while pounding his drums merci- 
lessly. 

Added to the visual effects was 
Migraine's fire-breaUiing stunt. The 
crowd yelled as Migraine made the 
"I love you" sign with one hand, 
while holding the torch in the other 
Tun plays a tribal beat whde the 
stunt is performed. 

The songs, "Neat, neaL neat" 



(pronounced "Nnncat") and a punk 
version of Van Morrison's "Brown- 
Eyed Girl." were audience favorites. 

The Migraines drew on their 
influences lo come up with a mostly 
punk, son-of heavy, pop sound 
Musically speaking, those influ- 
ences include: Black Sabbaih, 
Motor Head, AC/DC and the 
Beatles 

"Anything melodic," Migraine 
said Other sources of inspiration are 
Andrew Dice Clay, television sit- 
coms and Jolt cola. 

Upcoming project for the high- 
energy band include the November 
release of the new CD, "Juvenilia," 
on One Fool Records. Also forth- 
coming from (he band's own label. 
Sick Duck Records, is a collabora- 
(ive recording of the Migraines and 
Bobby Steele In October, (he group 
will lour wiih (he group "The 
Undead."

I am movie, hear me roar 



By Nol Becklev 
Editor 

I have relumed [o my notorious 
occasional feature: Editor's Picks. 
Tbis issue, to fit in with the 
"empowerment" Uieme our features 
editor came up with. 

Since much lime has passed 
since the last edition of E-Picks. I 
bad to enlist a new gang of idiots to 
assist me on my quest for "Movies 
that Empower You" or something 
close to that psychobabble. 

We feel we have come up with a 
wide variety of movies that appeal 
to everyone and also make everyone 
feel "warm and fuzzy" inside 

These are movies that make you 
iii ink life isn't so bad or nothing is 
impossible. 

Remember though, these are 
just for shits and grins. They are in 
no particular order and don't forget, 
no wagering 

• "The Power of One " Stephen 
DorfT and Morgan Freeman star in 
this epic film about an English boy 
growing up in South Africa He is 
beset on all sides by racism How he 
deals with racism and bis maturing 
from boy to man make this a great 
film seen by only a few people Best 
scene, when the boy gels all the 
tribes who have been imprisoned by 
the Apartheid government to coop- 
erate and sing together. 

• "Shawshank Redemption ." 
Written by Stephen King, the film 
shows the determination of one man 
nol lo be broken by the system. 
There are elements of "Cool Hand 
Lake" in this especially during the 
escape Morgan Freeman again 
(urns in a great performance as Tim 
Robbins' friend. Best scene: On the 
roof when the prisoners are drinking 
a beer and feeling like free men. 

• "Breakfast Club" Although my 
posse and I cannot stand Emilio 
Estevez. he did actually appear in a 
good 'movie'. This one reminds most 
of us about when wc were in high 
school because that is when it came 
out. But there is something more 
than just high school memories that 
this film shows. It shows bow 
everyone is just a person with prob- 
lems No matter if you're a jock, a 
brain, a princess, a delinquent or a 



sociopath Best scene: Judd Nelson 
raising his hand in victory as Ihe 
credits roll. 

• "Henry V" wtih Kenneth 
Branagh. Branagh plays Harry Ihe 
King in this masterful romp through 
the history of the greatest king in 
English history. The battle scenes 
are brutal and gory. Branagh's mas- 
tery of Shakespeare makes this 
arguably his best Shakespeare film. 
Best scene: The St. Crispin's Day 
speech before the Battle of 
Agincourt. At that battle, the French 
outnumbered the weary English by 
10 to 1. The Brits demolished the 
French. 

• "Rocky" What list of inspira- 
tional films wouldn't be complete 
without Sylvester Stallone's only 
good movie Stallone wrote and 
starred in this Academy Award win- 
ning tale of a man rising up from the 
muck against all odds and proving 
himself. Best scene: When Rocky 
trains by beating on a side of beef in 
the meat packing plant 

• "Thelma and Louise" or the 
working tide. "I am woman watch 
me shoot your nads off" Geena 
Davis and Susan Sarandon play the 
strongest women ever to grace the 
silver screen. No one has seen 
stronger women before or since. If 
only Drew Barrymore wasn't in film 
anymore, then maybe there would 
be no weak, stupid women left in 
films Best scene: The ending over 
the cliff. 

• "Star Wars." A western set in 
space is what this film actually is. 
The heroes are gleaming and full of 
goodness. The villains are blood- 
less, faceless murderous beasts I 
cannot remember if there was a lime 
at the theater when 1 didn't cheer 
when the Death Star was destroyed 
by Luke Skywalker. Best scene: 
Obi-Wan Kenobi dying at the hands 
of Danh Vader lo give Luke, Leia 
and Solo time lo escape. 

• "Mr. Smith Goes to 
Washington." Jimmic Stewart plays 
his basic character in the Frank 
Capra directed classic about a man 



refusing to be ebewed up by a giant 
political machine Claude Rains 
plays a crooked senator who betrays 
Stewart's trust. Stewart turns in his 
finest performance to date with this. 
Best scene: Stewart's filibuster in 
the Senate. 

• "The Burning Bed." This film 
inspired at least one woman to 
incinerate her husband, but more 
importantly, it gave the spark to 
many women to leave an abusive 
relationship. Along with T &amp; L, this 
movie treats women as strong, 
vibrant souls who should be respect- 
ed. Best scene: The title says it all 

• "Rain Man." Tom Cruise and 
Dustin Hoffman star in this "on the 
road" drama that is a soul journey 
for Tom Cruise who actually finds it 
after he gets to know Raymond. 
(Like there is any other plot for a 
Tom Cruise movie.) Hoffman is 
brilliant as an autistic savant. 

If you didn't know any belter 
you would think be wasn't acting I 
guess that was why they gave him 
an Oscar. Best scene: The bedroom 
scene when Cruise is getting busy 
and Raymond sits on the end of die 
bed reading the phone book. 

Other films that almost made 
the list include, "Glory," "Stand by 
Me," "The Longest Yard," "Falling 
Down" and "Jerry Maguire " 

These films are great, but they 
lack something special that the other 
films have. 

We have come to the end of our 
list and we hope you agree with a 
few of these, maybe all 

But if you have other flics you 
think should be on this list, contact 
the Communicator and apply to get 
in the "usual gang of idiots." 

We could always use more 
idiots.

consultant with this column, come

World will end soon, look qt the signs: Bcics, Boilers winning 



Dirty Laundry: Tony Laux 




•Lei me 
be ihe firsi per- 
son to publicly 
call for Dave 
"I'm glad ih. n I have a field goal 
kicker" Wannastadi's head. I jus! 
hope lhai he doesn't have an address 
anywhere close lo Brentwood or we 
will have another thai. 



* Here are some reasons (bat 
Judgment Day might be on its way 
so don't worry about those 
Christmas Cards you haven't sent 
out 

1. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers 
arc 5-0 and could be the favorite to 
win the NFC, especially after 
the Green Bay "Slackers" got there 
asses banded 10 lliem by the 
Lions. 

2. The Miami Hurricanes and 
Notre Dame Fighting Irish arc both 
out of the Top 25 rankings for the 
first time in over 10 years. Come on 
you guys, sell your souls like you 
used to and get a team (hat isn't so 
damn embarrassing to watcb. 



3. Out of the "Big 4" colleges in 
Indiana (Notre Dame. Purdue. 
Indiana and Ball State) who would 
have figured the Boilers would be 
the one kicking ass this year? As a 
fan of Purdue I just have to say it's 
about damn lime we get a winner. 

• A great example of loo much 
unnceded information is Marv 
Albert wearing women's silk 
panties. 1 know that this is not in my 

top ten sexual fantasies but, if it is, I 
am sure that he is going to have a lot 
of free time on his hands. 



' There were no losers in the 



race between Mark Maguirc and 
Ken Griffey, Jr. Even though nei- 
ther of them came close to beating 
Roger Maris' homcrun record, they 
still made it interesting to watch the 
final week of baseball. 

* Jeff "floor it and turn left" 
Gordon is well on his way to win- 
ning another Winston Cup 
Championship While Dale "hang it 
up" Eamdhart showed that profes- 
sional athletes should not hang on 
too long by extending his streak lo 
54 straight races without a win. 1 
think that it may be time for the 
"Intimidator" to realize that he has 



• If Bob Sura of the Cleveland 
Cavaliers is worth six million dol- 
lars a year, all of the other short 
players who can't shoot more than 
five feet from the basket deserve a 
raise 1 am sure that he served a pur- 
pose in the worst ofTense in the 
NBA but I am still grasping for what 
exactly that purpose was. 

* The games of October are 
starting up and it looks like it will be 
an exciting playoff season. The 
Indians open up against the Yankees 
which would be a little more excit- 



ing if we were talking about colonial 
limes. 

Seatde and Baltimore will make 
it interesting because of the ability 
of both teams to score. The real 
series will be between Atlanta and 
Houston The reason that it is the 
real series is because the Braves will 
have a real easy time crushing the 
representative of the weakest divi- 
sion in baseball The overpriced 
Marlins, except Charles Johnson, 
show that money can't buy you love 
or a championship when San 
Francisco rides their winning streak 
to a scries victory. 



Irish need to regroup 



Smokin' hash marks: Scott Warden 




After 
what seemed to be hours and hours 
of raking leaves, my brother and I 
would pile around the TV lo watch 
the Notre Dame game There was 
something special about those 
Saturday afternoons. Not that I had 
a lot of problems growing up. but 
when I did. I was able to forget 
about them for three hours as I 
basked in the warm glow of televi- 
sion. 

The introduction of the broad- 
cast was enough to make me smile 
as NBC would begin every game 
looking back on the history of Notre 
Dame football with a touching 
monologue about (heFour 
Horsemen. Paul Horning, Joe 
Theisman or Joe Montana. 

If the Irish won. it wasn't a big 
deal, because it was expected no 



matter who they were playing, but if 
they lost, my world stopped as I 
tried to comprehend another season 
lost and the chances of a National 
Championship shattered. 

Despite the loss, I was able to 
hold my head up high with pride 
knowing that Notre Dame's II 
National Championships were sec- 
ond to no other program m the coun- 
try 

Which brings us to present day. 

Notre Dame is four points away 
from being 0-4 under first-year head 
coach Bob Davie The Insh are 1-3 
with their only win coming against a 
very mediocre-al-besi Georgia Tech 
team. 

Since then, they've lost to three 
Big Ten teams in a row — Purdue. 
Michigan State and Michigan. 

In the past 10 years, I can't 
remember going inio a game when 1 
didn't think that Notre Dame would 
win — until last Saturday's game 
ag ainst Mich i aan. _

It's nearly impossible to point to 
one man or reason for the demise of 
America's greatest college program- 
Most would point to former Purdue 
coach and current Notre Dame 
offensive coordinator Jim Collelto 
That'd be the easy way out. 

If any blame should be dished 
out or any fingers pointed, it should 
be directed solely at the bean of the 
Notre Dame players and maybe at 
Lou Holtz for leaving. The Insh 
never would have lost to Purdue 
under Holtz, because to him, every 
team he played should have been 
No. 1 in the country and his players 
weren't allowed to take anyone 
lightly. 

Notre Dame shouldn't need a 
rebuilding year, but the program is 
going through one right now and all 
of us fans will simply have to wait 
until next year to get National 
Championship No. 12.

The Greek returns 



By Nol Beckley 

Editor 



Unfortunate!) Tor mc, I was nol 
able to appear in last week's issue as 
your football prognoslicalor. I 
missed you. but lei me tell you I 
wem undefeated last week, I picked 
every game I covered the spread in 
every game If you believe ibau 
maybe you also believe Dave 
Wannastadl made a good decision 
with the Rick Mirer trade. 

Anywho, lei's get lo the games: 

Games or the Week: 

New England at Denver 

A battle of the last unbeaten 
teams in the AFC Elway should 
light up the defense, but so will 
Bledsoe This match will come 
down to the ground game. Denver's 
Terrell Davis will dominate this 
game 
Prediction: Denver by 4 

Tampa Bay at Green Bay 

I'm so old I remember when mis 
game didn't mean a damned thing. 
Who cared about the battle of the 
Bays 10 years ago Well everyone 
better keep an eye on this game I 
think you may be looking at the 
NFC liile game. 
Gutless prediction: Green Bay by 3 

Worth Watching: 

Kansas City at Miami 

I know I've picked against K.C. 
every week. It's nothing against 
Shoiienheimer, I just have some- 
thing against QB's from Michigan 
and the Big 10 in general. Look at 
Tomczak or Harbaugh. And also 
look at Grbac. 
Prediction: Kansas City by 6 

New Orleans at Chicago 

Wdl da' Bears beat their old 
coach? Yeah and Marv doesn't have 
skid marks in his panties. Difka will 
triumphantly return to Chicago and 
destroy the hapless Bears. 
Prediction: New Orleans by 14 



Baltimore at Pittsburgh 

Vinnie Testcvcrde 
always plays above 
his skills against the 
Steelers. For some 
reason this Heisman 
bust has bis best 
game of the year 
against Pittsburgh 
And without 
Woodson, the 
dc fen s i v£ 
backfield 
doesn't have 




a prayer 
Predictio 
Baltimore by 



May hold your 
attention: 

New York Jets at Indianapolis 

Will the Colts snatch defeat 
from the jaws of victory again? Bet 
on it. The Jets are looking better 
than they have in a decade. Which 
Isn't saying much. Parcells actually 
gave them something, a game plan 
Prediction; Jets by 13 

Detroit at Buffalo 

The Lions are on a high after 
beating Superbowl champ Packers 
It shouldn't hold up The Lions are 
the most schizo team in the league. 
One week they beat the champs, 
then the next week they get beat by 
the Bills 
Prediction: Bills by 7 

Minnesota at Arizona 



The Minnesota defense should 
blitz the hell out of whatever loser is 



QB for Zona. Who is the QB? Who 
actually cares? Nol I. 

Prediction: Minnesota by 
13 



The rest of 
the field: 

Tennessee at 

Seattle 

This one. since 
both learns blow harder 
than J Edgar Hoover at 
an FBI staff meeting 
Prediction: Seattle by 



Cincinnati at 
Jacksonville 

T h e 

Bengals could 

make a big 

for the 

AFC Central 

title. And then 

again, Dukakis could have won 

another state 

Prediction: Jacksonville by 10 

Dallas at New York Giants 

If Dallas can't beat the Giants 
by a helluva lot they belter think 
about snorting coke again. They 
played belier when they were baked. 
Prediction: Dallas by 17 

Washington at Philadelphia 

The 'Skins should smack the 
Eagles around like a bunch of ex- 
wives at Ike Turner's house. 
Prediction: Washington by 9 

Worst game of the 

WEEK 

San Diego at Oakland 

Oakland has one strongest 
offenses, but their kicking game 
comes straight from the toilet. 
Maybe it's nol their kicking game, 
but their holder. 
Prediction: Oakland by 4
