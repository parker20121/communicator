We arc thrilled to 
inform you that Walt

financial affairs, said that 
there is a fairly substantial 
demand for residence halls 
and that IPFW is going to 
take a more serious look at 
building dorms. 

According to Branson. 
IPFW is currently taking a 
step back and is slowly ana- 
lyzing all the information 
from the surveys. Many dif- 
ferent angles arc still being 

According to the study. 
there is a demand Tor 
approximately 1700 to 1800

probably start off with 550. 

Before the project can

factors that IPFW must take

Berlin Wall reminder to families to forget squabbles 



by. Mishanna Wood, Managing Edii 
Two huge cement partitions that were 
27-miles long, armed with guns, traps, 
sirens, lights and barbed wire separat- 
ed the people of Germany for 28 
years. The ghasdy thing cut through 
cities, graveyards and families. 

It was a huge beast thai reminded

rupt their government was during

According to CNN reports, the 
wall facing West German* was filled 
with the works of graffiti artists while 
the wall facing East German) was 
while so that escapees could be spot- 
tod easily. No one was allowed to go 
near the Bradenhurg Gate in Berlin. 

People died trying to cross from 
east to west. If a person was wounded. 
he could not be helped. Hit fellow 
Germans had to stand back for fear of 

Many people remember the grue- 
some and shocking death of Peter 
Fetcher of East Germany, People 
watched him die after being shot while 
crossing the wall. No one stopped to 
help him as he lay dying in the death 
strip. No one was called to the scene. 
This situation led to many riots in 
Germany and Is one of the main rea- 
sons why the wall was known as the 



, Patriotism- Where are you? 



Wall of Shame. 

On Nov. 9. 1989, the Berlin Wall 
was taken down as Communism was 
overthrown. People celebrated, 
exchanged, gifts and saw family and 
friends that the; had been missing for 



This

Our friend wrote, loiters iu

wall was taken down. We had a huge 

dinner in honor of the fallen wall. 

The friend went to visit her aunt 
and received pieces from the wall. She 
onl) wished she could have been there 
m person to see the event. She kept 
twining the piece of the wall over 
and over in her hands. It represented 
the long separation she and the rest of 
her people had to endure. 

Ihe reaction our friend had to 
this event showed how much this wall 
had divided the country. The results 
of the wall arc still present today and 
the differences between east and west 
are still very apparent. 

According to CNN reports, one 
German native noted that both sides 
were very' different from each other. It 
is very difficult to know family and 
friends with a death trap as a barrier. 
There is an ugly stretch in Germany 



that should remind the world of how 
terrible separation is. The remains of 
the wall arc a universal example of 
people torn apart. 

CNN reported that there were 16(1 
cellists, five stages for musicians and 
fireworks at this wear's anniversary of 
the fall of the Berlin Wall. No one has 
forgotten. 

We can take the results of this 
event and incorporate them into our 
own lives. Some of us ma) be separat- 
ed from our families and friends. This 
may be by choice, force or a lack of 
motivation to pick up the phone or 
write a letter. 

People should take the time to 
keep in touch with their relatives. 
Today, German) is still recovering 
from the blows of the Berlin Wall. One 
example of this is in the differences in 
the economies between the two halves 
of Germany, CNN reported that one 
individual actually wanted the wall to 
be put back up. 

This is not the attitude to have. 
Perhaps someday the problems will be 
solved. People should take the time to 
reflect about the situation In 
Germany. Perhaps families and friends 
could assist in the fall of the personal 
qualms and barriers that they may 
have between each other. 

We can look at the Berlin Wall as 
an example of what happens when 
loved ones arc kept apart.

Eating disorder awareness: symptoms and treatments 



byCfxfyWifflarns.n.N., 
Guesl Writer 

Many Americans are obsessed 
with the concept of beauty. Thinness 
is frequently equated with beauty. At 
the same time, a high percentage of 
Americans are overweight. 

This dichotomy contributes to 
the high rate of eating disorders 
existing in the United States. The 
most common eating disorders are 
binge or compulsive overeating, 
bulimia and anorexia nervosa. 

There are certain characteristics 
found in individuals prone to eating 
disorders. These individuals tend to 
be pelTcctlonists. people pleasers or 
ma) have low self-esteem. There can 
also be a fear of sexuality or intima- 



=adng. 



Binge or compulsive o\ 
most often done in private, 
of engaging in eating extensively, 
typically during periods of stress. 
Feelings of loneliness, anxiety, bore- 
dom or a desire to reward oneself 
can trigger episodes of binge eating. 

Characteristics of binge eating 
as described by L Alexander-Molt 
and D.B. Lumsdon in the book 
"Obesltj ■," are eating when not hun- 
gry', eating until physically uncom- 
fortable, rapid consumption of large 
amounts of food, feelings of being 
out of control and feelings of shame 
and disgust following binge eating. 
Statistics indicate that binge caters

Woody Guthrie's musical legacy 
celebrated in 'Mermaid Avenue' 



by Bnan Lindquisl, 
SlaH Writer 



Woody Guthrie is an American leg- 
end who deserves to be recognized for 
what he did and what he left behind 
when he died in 19137. While Guthrie's 
work is certain!) well-documented, much 
of his music seems unaciessihle to most 
listeners. Through the efforts of the 
Smithsonian Institution, many of 
Guthrie's recordings can be purchased on 
compact disc. While today's icchnDlog) 
has allowed the producers to eliminate 
much of the noise associated with earl) 
recordings, one can tell that these are not 
recent recordings, however, clarity Is not 
the point. Guthrie's music Is and the 
Smithsonian institution has done a mar- 
velous job of making Guthrie's musk 
available to everyone. 

"Mermaid Avenue" is the newest 
Incarnation of Guthrie's legacy. With Bill) 
Bragg and Wilco providing the music for 
the lyrics. Guthrie is now more accessible 
than ever to ever) listener interested in 
the history of Guthrie and the music he 
wrote. This CD is a collaboration of his 
work that allows a new generation of 
song and music writers to look at Guthrie 
in a way previously unavailable. Many- 
people may view the matching as sacrile- 
gious, however, I believe that the match- 
ing is an Incredible way for modern 
music listeners to become involved with a 
d&gt; represents a genuine piece of 



American heritage. 

Bragg explains the title of the album 
in the liner notes: "Mermaid Avenue is 
the name of the street In Coney Island, 
Brooklyn that was home to Woody 
Guthrie and his wife Marlorie and their 
kids in the years that followed World War 
II. Here he daydreamed about making 
love to Ingrld Bergman on the slopes of 
an Italian volcano and wondered to him- 
self what he would do if, like fellow left- 
wing songwriter Hanns Lisler, he was 
called before the house i 

songs. Hundreds of them. Nonsense : 
for his kids like 'HOODOO VOODOOY 
visions of his own Oklahoma childhood 
like 'Way Over Yonder in the Minor Key,* 
mid-century love songs like 'Hesitating 
Beauty' and works of personal self-explo- 
ration like 'Another Man's Done Gone' 
that make him a prime candidate." 

^enue" opens with "Wall 



"HOODOO VOODOO" Is a nonsense 
song that still manages to captivate the 
listener with lyrics such as: "Hoodoo

reading from a book of his poetry. 
"Ingrid Bergman" is the song in which 
Bragg mentions Guthrie's affection for 
Ingrid Bergman: "Ingrid Bergman, vou're 
so pert), you'd make any mountain 



Many of the lyrics recall 
Oklahoma, like "Way Over Yonder in the 
Minor Key," "She Came Along to Me." "At 
My Window Sad and Lonely " and "One by 
One" These lyrics have been beautifull'v 
adapted into songs by .Bragg and Wilco. 



For President" is the only 
song on the album that discusses politics. 
"The only way we can ever beat these 
crooked politician men. is to run the 
money changers out of the temple and 
put the Carpenter In." 

While the music and lyrics fit togeth- 
er well, producing a folky synergy 
between Guthrie, Bragg and Wilco. this is 
not a typical Guthrie album. "Mermaid 
Avenue" is certainly an album for a new 
generation, but that does not mean that 
we can forget Guthrie's original record- 
ings. "Buffalo Skinners," "Mulcskinner 
Blues" and "Dust Bowl Ballads" are cer- 
tainly good albums with which to get 

Guthrie's voice is about as Oklahoma 
as one can get. and it is important to 
remember Guthrie as he was during the 
1940s and '50s. 

"Mermaid Avenue" is certainly the 
best place to start listening to Guthrie's 
words, but for his performance of the
