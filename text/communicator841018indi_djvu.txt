(Opinion 



■J-he ^onimurik Jltir 



Did the Gremlins do it? 



Maybe Gremlins, or hockey players, 
have been tampering with National 
Basketball Exhibition games. 

On Oct. 7. the scheduled game between 
I he Indiana Pacers and the Detroit 
Pistons was cancelled because of water 
condensation on the court That game 
was to benefit the IPFW athletic 
department- 
Games In the Los Angeles Forum and 
In the Meadowlands In New Jersey were 
also cancelled for the same reason. 

Was it purely coincidence that three 
games in three areas of the country in 
the same week were all cancelled? Or 



was it a bunch of Gremlins? After all, 
the gremlins In the movie needed water 
in order lo multiply. Maybe these 
gremlins have found a place to hide 
under a basketball floor on the ice. 
Maybe it was hockey. All three of the 
affected arenas are also homes of 
hockey teams. 

Actually, we believe il was probably 
more coincidental than anything else. 
Whatever the reason, no hard problems 
should be developed between the 
Coliseum management and the athletic 
department. 



Refund possible 



James Bundschuh. dean of science 
and humanilies, plans lo ask Edward A. 
Nicholson, acting chancellor, for a 
refund lo students enrolled In COM 334, 
Journalism lor the Electronic Mass 
Media, who paid unnecessary lab fees. 

The students in that class had sent a 
petition to the department of com- 
munication and theatre asking for their 
money back. The students contended 
(hat no lab was involved in their course 
work. The deportment of corn- 






contended a lab was involved. 

For a while, il had appeared as though 
the petition had fallen on deaf ea 
P. Ulmer, dean of student servi. 
done behind the scenes work to gel 
Bundschuh to ask Nicholson (or a 
refund. Whether Nicholson refunds the 
money remains lo be seen. We hope 
Nicholson does grant (he refund. 

In addition to granting the refund, 
Nicholson also should look inlo how 
IPFW assesses lab fees in order to 
prevent a similar problem in the future.

With the price or attending IPFW 
increasing each year, more and more 
students are turning lo guaranteed 
student loans to pay tor their education. 
The problem is, many students don't 
realize how much il will cosl to repay the 

The Reagan Administration has, in the 
past, attempted to make it more and 
more difficult for these loans to be 
acquired. 

Who Is (0 say the Reagan 
Administration won't make loans more 
difficult lo obtain In the Future? 

If GSL's become more difficult lo 
obtain, going lo college may become 
attainable only for the rich. Education, 
particularly public education, should be 
available lo everyone, not just the 
wealthy. 

People arguing against GSL's should 



look at Ihe startling statistic Purdue 
University recently released — 10 
percent of all Purdue students were on 
academic probation last spring. Purdue 
officials said a major cause for the high 
number of students on academic 
probation was because many students 
now have (o work in order to pay for 
their education — leaving less lime for 
studying.

Students honored Sun. 



, About 1,000 students were recognized 
Sunday at an honors convocation in the 
Multipurpose Building. 

The Communicator would like to take 
this opportunity lo congratulate those 
students loo. 

With increased pressures from outside 
IPFW, malnlaining an outstanding 
grade point average is often nearly 
impossible. 

While The Communicator doesn't have 
the space to name every student 
honored, we would like to say good luck 
in your future endeavors. 

Students were recognized for being on 



the Chancellor's list, the Vice Chan- 
cellor's list and the Dean's list. 

In order to make the Chancellor's list, 
a student had to complete at least 12 
hours with a 4.0 grade point average on 
the IU system or a 6.0 on the Purdue 

To make the Vice Chancellor's list, a 
student had to have a grade point 
average of at least 3.75 on the IU system 
or 5.75 on ihe Purdue system. 

To make the Dean's list, a sludent 
must have a grade point average of 3 5 
on the IU system or S.5 on the Purdue 
system.

WOMEN ANEWCHOICE. 



It's been a tony firm: Twenty-four years, 
jj and there hasn't been a sensible new option 
n birth control. 
Until Today." Today, the 24-hour 
Contraceptive Sponge. 

Today is a soft, comfortable sponge that contains 
Nonoxynol-9, the same effective spermicide women 
have been using for over Z0 years. 
The Sponge is easy to use You just moisten it thoroughly with 
t and insert it like a lampon, and n works for a full 24 hours. 
With The Sponge, you don't have to worry about hormonal side effects. 
And no other non-prescription vaginal contraceptive has been proven more 
effective" Its been through seven years of extensive testing, and over 17 million 
Sponges have been sold. 

Of course, you don't need a prescription for The Sponge. It can be found 
at your local drug store and at selected supermarkets. In the 3-pack or convenient 
12-pack. 

And the Today Sponge is the only contraceptive ihat comes with someone 
to talk to: our 24-hour Today TalkLine. If you have any questions, or you're just 
wandering if The Sponge is right for you, visit your student health center or give 
us a call at 800-223-2329. (In California, 800-222-23 29- ) 

Finally. you have the spontaneity you want and the protection you need. But, 
best of all, you have another choice you never had before. 
Until Today.

orgoniintlon hoi Its own 
national charter and one or 
more chart Ilea it supports. 

Sigma Pi Epillon Is one of 
the largal fraternities on 
campus. It rushes a period of 

recruited twice a year, twice 
in the fall and once in the 
spring. A lol of people here 
Just come and go to class 
without really meeting 



party later on Ibis month." 

Since Sigma PI Epillon 

does not have a house It must 

rent a hall to throw a party 

When asked why they do 
lain problem is 



Unlike the other greek 
organizations. Phi Kappa

live. Dave Phillips hopes to 
have a separate house for 
IPFW in the future. 

Phi Kappa Theta 



Delta Gamma has the

Another new fraternity on 
campus Is Phi Kappa Thcla 
Phi Kappa Theta has a dual 
charter, the original chaplcr 
is based at Indiana Inalibjte 
of Technology. Phi Kappa 



pledges do something really 
stupid and degrading that
