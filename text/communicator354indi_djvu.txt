IPFW made official |[ 

change from Division II In Division I. 

"We ate delighted that the NCAA has acted favorably 
on our appeal." Chancellor Michael W.irtcll said. In late 
July. Ihe NCAA Management Council approved Ihe sub- 
committee's recommend; n not to gr.inl j waiver to IPFW 

because ii had nut "made clear before April 12 ils intent lo 
reclassify." April 12 was the date the NCAA approved a 
two-year moratorium on I lis ,, ion I applications. 

Then, on Aug. 8, IPFW announced it would appeal the 
decision and provide the NCAA with adduional information 
regarding its contact with the NCAA, 

IPFW will face a two-year ban on postseason play or 
conference championships, which is unpleasant news for 
ihe men's soccer team which competed in Ihc Elite Eight of 
the NCAA Division 11 Tournament The learn was hoping to 
make another national championship L ' '

One area of debale is 
whether or not IPFW can 

generate money to stay in 
Division I. Currently, IPKW 

students arc paying ST/credil 
hour in fees, with 60 percenl of 
Ihe money going toward funding 
athletics and 40 percent lo fund 
the sludent govemmcni. 

IPFW's sister school, 
IUPUI. mandates lhai sludent 
spay a S27.70 fee just lo support 



deficit of S150.000. They need 
59S0.00O in additional annual 
support to move substantially 
toward Title IX compliance and 
additional annual funds lo bring 
men's and women's spans to Ihe 
MAC average support per sport. 
A grand total of approximately 
SI. 3 million is still needed. They 
predict lhat the net potential 
annual deficit will be 5893,000. 
Miami students already pay 
the highest general fee of the 
Oh.o institution! within the 
MAC to support inlercollc- 

athlci.es.

will not have any vacancies. Sludent quarters will be 
located across from campus, off of Crescenl Avenue. In

the slieel and housing will be on die other. Students will 
have access to the campus via a bridge. 

Al this point the university does not know what the 
cost of the facility will be IPFW will lease the property
