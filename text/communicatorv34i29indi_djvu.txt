Report shows rise in crime on campus 



22 more incidents 
reported this 
quarter than 
same time in '03 



For the second reportine, peri- 
od of the school year, a variety of 
crimes have risen on campus. The 
IPFW Police and Safety Quarterly 
Report showed the significant 
jump in crime statistics in numbers 
released Monday. 

During the three-month quar- 



ter, 22 more crimes or police 
requested situations were reported 
than the same quarter a year ago, 
up from 46 to 68 reports in the first 
quarter of 2004. 

The crime statistics were i.iken 
for the period covering January 
through March, 2004. Traditionally, 
the safety report also carries with it 
a bracket covering the statistics 
outlining the previous year and the 
same quarter from the previous 

Officials aren't anxious about 
the higher rates, but admit they're 
becoming cautious about the num- 

"We have had peaks like this 



before but we'll be watching it at 
this point," IPFW Police Chief 
Lauren DenHartog explained 
Tuesday. 

Big spikes are evident in 
report* concerning disorderly con- 
duct, harassment, indecent expo- 
sure and personal thefts. 

Reports of harassment have 
-■kv rocketed on campus, with nine 
incidents cited during the first 
three months of 2004. That is the 
same number of total harassment 
cases during the entire year of 2003. 

Technology has made it much 
easier for people to harass one- 
another, and students are being 
cited for that type of activity more- 



"We've had our times when things have 
happened, but on the whole, we're a safe 
campus." 

-Chief Lauren DenHartog 
IPFW Police and Safety 



and-more, DenHartog said. 

"With email, it's easy to write 
something that you wouldn't say 
to a person face-to-face," he said. 

When it is a first offense and 
studenUigainst-student, the 

harassment allegation may be set- 
tled through the IPFW Dean of 
Students and the school's discipli- 
nary system.

-Catherine Mulder

It's been a week since a Senate 
Faculty meeting brought to light 
disturbing allegations of unsafe 
craftsmanship and potentially 
health-hazardous mold at the 
Waterfield Student Housing com- 
plex. 

Now, both sides are waiting to 
hear from the other. 

Neither has called, either to 
ask for nor to offer the evidence 
given initially at the April 19 meet- 
ing. 

It's not that neither side cares. 
Both emphasize they do. It's just an 
apparent communication break- 
down between those worried

Chancellor of Financial Affairs 
Walt Branson said Monday. 

But because of the queries, 
mold testing will be completed this 
week, according to officials. 

"I hope they do proper test- 
ing. I don't know how they've 
done or what they're going to do," 
Assistant Professor of Labor 
Studies Catherine Mulder said.

sial building project straight into 
the lights of the IPFW Faculty

IPFW organizations seek new membership 



92 groups and 
growing, IPFW 
hopes to give 
something to do 



Even as the school year begins 
to wind down, IPFW student 
organizations are trying to get up 
and running - and others keep 
attempting to grow. 

With almost 100 organiza- 
tions, university officials hope the 
variety of ideas give everyone an 
opportunity to interact with others. 

"We want to find something 
here for everyone. With 92 student 
organizations, we hope they can," 
Student Life assistant director 
Audrey Moore said. 

The organizations tend to be 
categorized between departmental, 
religious and special interest 
groups. A new one named Club 
Sports will include individuals 
involved in wake board and the 
waterskiing team. 



Also, among the newest 
groups are the Finance Society and 
the Hillel Organization. 

Moore noted other groups 
attempting to restructure them- 
selves are a Civil Engineering 
group and the Society of Physics 
Students. 

For Shane McCort, helping to 
start Hillel as a religious organiza- 
tion on campus will give another 
spiritual channel at IPFW. 

"It'll provide camaraderie for 
the Jewish students here and will 
be an outlet for religious creativity 
. . . it'll be a place to associate with 
like-minded people," he said. 

The group, which has about a 
half-dozen members so far, is cur- 
rently growing through word of 
mouth and fliers. To be officially 
recognized as a campus organiza- 
tion, at least eight people need to 
be members. 

Finding that initial member- 
ship has taken some time, McCort 
explained. But with current events, 
it doesn't shock him. 

"We can't be the only Jewish 
students on campus. It's never

Gospel Fest Explosion is 
night of praise, worship 




The Paul Jean Provost Laboratory of Ethnology and 
Bioanthropology was dedicated Friday with a crowd of 
over 100 attending. Above, Liz and June Pulzer look at a 
selection of photographs showing portions of Provosfs 
life. The founder of IPFW's Anthropology Department 
died of a sudden illness in December. 



Kettler lab 
in memory 

By Scott M. Lawson 



Over 100 people attended a 
ceremony honoring Anthropology 
Professor Paul Provost th.it dedi- 
cated a Kettler Hall labroatory 
Friday and established a scholar- 
ship in his name. 

Provost passed away Dec. 24 
after a short illness, but his impact 
at IPFW is poinj; 1" he long Listing, 
collegues and students expressed. 

Longtime friend and fellow 
professor Alan Sandstrom praised 
Provost's life. 

"Paul had courage, intestinal 
fortitude, committment, the ability 
to leave a comfort zone - and 
above all: intergity," Sandstrom 

His dedication to anthropolo- 
gy as .1 sueme translated to want- 
ing to invest in its success on cam- 
In 1973, Provost was hired by 
IPFW - but was told by university 
Officials that anthropology would 
never be a successful courseload, 
much less a department. 

"We are all here today because 
he decided to stay here and fight. 
Paul, of course, ignored the advice 
givers and began to create the 
social context to develope a 
Department of Anthropology," 
Sandstrom noted. That department 
now boasts over 100 degrees and 
has sis lull time professors. 

Provost was the first Fulbright 
winner at IPFW, and through the 
years taught over 7,200 students. 

"He provided them with an 
example of what a life of adventure 
and of mind can be," Sandstrom 

Several former students in 
attendance agreed. 

Wiping away tears, junior 
Nina Collins explained his caring 
for students is what first attracted 
her to anthropology - and she's 
now majoring in the field. 

"He turned me onto aotliro- 



dedicated 
of Provost 

pology as a science," she said. 

And it wasn't just profession- 
al - Provost made her and her fam- 
ily feel welcome. "It really meant a 
lot to me," she said. 

Collins noted his love for the 
Meld brought many students into it

, genuine passion for 
anthropology," she said. "The 
world may have lost many more 
anthropology majors," Collins 
added. 

Senior Denise Lewis said 
Provost would have loved the cer- 
emony, which included many of 
his friends and a bagpipe lament 
from IPFW Professor Chad 
Thompson. 

"One of the first things 1 
thought was Dr. Provost would 
have had a blast. With all the 
sweets, the coffee, the people and 
the conversation, he would have 
loved this ... this is awesome," she 

She had taken Culture and 
Society, an intrnducturv anthropol- 
gy course, and became a major 
because of that experience. 

"Some of the stories he had to 
tell, some of the things he had to 
say, he pulled you in," Lewis said. 
"He was a great guv," she added. 

IPFW Chancellor Michael 
U'artell said he knew Provost, but 
really learned how good he was at 
leaching when his own son had 
Provost as a professor He noted 
his son rarely praises professors. 

"(He) thought Paul was 
absolutely tops, and that makes 
him tops in my book, too. He was 
incredibly committed to students 
and he was a model for a lot of our 
teaching," Wartell said. 

Sandstrom praised Provost as 
i person more people, not just 
anthropologists, should try to 
emulate. 

"He's an example for all of 
what one person can do," 
Sandstrom said. "He was one of a 
kind." 



Over 200 attend 
event held at 
Walb Sunday 

By Scott M. Lawson 



Praising God isn't just a song 
and holy book. For over 200 peo- 
ple, different performances wor- 
shipping were all the same in 
expressing their faith. 

A total of 16 different per- 
formances were held Sunday at the 
Walb Union Ballroom where the 
Black Collegian Caucus presented 
the BCC Gospel Fest Explosion. 

And it wasn't just a night of 
praising through tradition,]! gospel 
voices. Pastor Troy Bratton opened 
up the night with a rap composi- 
tion. Trenholm Rice performed a 
congo solo and Ronnie Shorts 
mimed to a song of worship. 

Worshipping isn't just 
expressed through one sense or 
trait, BCC secretary David Martin 
explained. And that was the pur- 
pose of the night. 

"It's not structured and it's 
not traditional. We have various 
different acts that go over the 
whole general music genre, from 
rap to classical to opera," he said. 

Along with the voices, there 
were drill teams and dance teams

performing during the night. 

"We let anyone show their tal- 
ent to praise God," Martin added. 

Other gospel tests have taken 
place at IPFW, he said. The 2004 
event has taken on a different 
atmosphere with the ongoing wars 
against terrorism and also in Iraq 
in the headlines daily. This was an 
effort to help unite the community 
through differences and similari- 
ties, Martin expressed. 

"We're just trying to bring 
back diversity and multicultural- 
ism into praising God," he said. 

The Sunday night was emceed 
by evangelist Rhonda White who 
on more than one occasion brought 



the people out of their seats as she 
was moved through the energy of 
the talent on stage. 

Among those performing 
were Bratton, Rice, Shorts along 
with Francis Smith, Latrice White, 
Shawnae Branham, Bonita Reed, 
Jason Blake, the poet Infinite and 
Chris ta Rose. 

Along with those individual 
performers were a number of 
groups taking the stage, including 
the Spiritual Israel Church and Its 
Army Youth choir, the Greater 
Spirit of Love drill team. Cross

Having a chalk with God 



Matt Lewis tells 
story of faith, art 
to IPFW students 



Matt Lewis says he prayed to 
God, and he decided he wanted to 
live his life in whatever direction 
the Lord wanted him to. 

Less than 48 hours later, the 
17-year-old learned the direction -- 
and apparently the Lord gives 
some of us unique road maps. 

He had been trying to do 
stand-up comedy at a DARE rally 
when he was introduced to the art 
of chalk drawing. It fascinated him, 
and he became an apprentice to the 
artform the day after he graduated 



high school in 1997. 

Now 25, Lewis does about 
150-200 shows a year, from coast- 
to-coast and into Canada. 

"I don't have a tear-jerking 
story. I have some talents God has 
given me and I use these for His 
glory," he said. 

He presented his talents and 
tale to about 100 people who 
attended his show Friday held by 
IPFW InterVarsity. 

Lewis bases his faith on a 
verse in the Old Testament, 
Jeremiah 29:11, which speaks to 
God having plans for everyone. 

For him, the art plan wasn't 
one he had early on. 

"I took art in high school and 
got a D. I never thought I'd do any- 
thing with art," Lewis joked. 

The presentation is multime- 



as Lewis shared his story at the 
beginning; music played while the 
chalk dust flew and a movie over it 
at the end. 

"It goes from this blank can- 
vas to a full-blown picture in 12 or 
13 minutes ... it's created right in 
front of their eyes," he said. 

Those attending were inspired 
by the night. 

"I enjoyed the sincerity of it, 
and the humor mixed in with it," 
IPFW junior Josie Sillampa said. "I 
also appreciated the art. I think it 
speaks a language that sometimes 
words can't," she added. 

Organizers were pleased with 
the event. 

"It went really well. A lot of 
people came out and had a good 
time. Hopefully, some people were 
touched," InterVarsity member 



dia, with a bit of stand-up comedy Nick Becker said.

of the Student Body under then 
President Justin Busch, was elected 
President for the current school 
year in spring of 2003 and reelected 
this past March. 

Recently, Shilling made the 
decision to transfer to 
Northwestern University to seek a 
degree in engineering in accident 
reconstruction. The degree will 
allow Shilling to go into his father's 
business, which handles accident 
reconstruction. 

"I just thought it was time to 
move on. I am going to regret very 
much leaving IPFW. I have grown 
up here over the past four years 
and the university has given me a 
lot of opportunities," said Shilling. 
"So I am indebted to the university 
in a way. However, this is some- 
thing I need to do to move on." 

Now that Shilling has decided 
against returning, Yahne will take 
over as President. However, Yahne 
was still sworn in as Vice President. 
He will move up in position on the 
first day of the first Summer 
Session. The yet to be elected sen- 
ate protemp will then eventually 
fill the void at Vice President. 

"(I have) big shoes to fill obvi- 
ously. Matt has done great things. I 
am certainly sorry to see him leave. 
But I feel I will be able to handle 
the job," said Yahne. 

"I have no doubt that he 



(Yahne) has the leadership skills to 
take over the office." said Shilling, 
alluding to his successor. "1 have no 
apprehensions about leaving, and 
that is what made my decision a lit- 
tle bit easier." 

Other than Yahne, two others 
were sworn into office. Eric 
McConaha was sworn in again as 
Vice President of Programming 
This will be McConaha's third term 
in that office. Tony Wilson was 
sworn in as Vice President of 
Finance and will replace Caroline 
Harlan in that office. 

Bialik, a student senate advis- 
er, spoke briefly about the outgoing 
officers Shilling, Harlan, 

McConaha and current Vice 
President of the Student Body lohn 

"I think each and every one of 
them has served IPFW well," said 
Bialik. "There has never been a time 
when they were not available and 
willing to do things." 

Yahne plans to continue many 
things that Shilling has started dur- 
ing his term, including being a pro- 
ponent for the student legal servic- 
es. Yahne also plans to try and 
implement a substance abuse 
counseling program. 

"Ifs certainly going to be a 
task," said Yahne. "But not an 
unmanageable one by any means."

for student safety, she said. 

The seven-unit facilty, set to 
open in mid-August, will house 
over 550 students once it gets its 
final okay. IPFW Physical Plant 
Director David Danielson said the 
school is adding a new batch of 
inspections as a precaution. 

"We've hired a company to 
come in and do inspections." 
Danielson said. 

That company, Industrial 
Solutions Group, Inc., should con- 
duct their queries through the end 
of the week and will have a report 
to be released in early May, 
Danielson noted. 

Simply enough, Danielson 
believes detractors wouldn't 
believe him if he went any other 
direction with the inspections. 

"I've got people on staff who 
could do this for me, but 1 think 
I'm better off getting an outside 
opinion to come in," he said. 

Branson noted nobody has 
offered the photographs shown 
last week, and that is one thing the 
school would be interested in see- 
ing before the inspections are con- 
ducted. Along with the photo- 
graphs, Mulder said she has sever- 
al affidavits from contractors who 
have stated they've seen mold on 
wood. She also doubts university 
officials really have a desire to see 
anything that might set the project 

"They haven't contacted me 
to get the pictures, and I don't 
think they want them," Mulder 



Danielson said the pictures 
shown aren't 100 percent proof of 
anything as it is. Some are taken at 
odd angles, he contends, and oth- 
ers seemed to be taken to look 
darker than he'd expect. Danielson 
is going to assume they were taken 
at the work site, but contends 
inspectors would never allow 
moldy wood or wood that had sat 
in puddles to be used in the con- 



troubles are 
linked on 

saying that 

all the other problems in that proj- 
ect are mutually exclusive. I think 
it's a pattern when you have a con- 
tractor that disrespects the law. It's 
a pattern, and the craftsmanship 
and the shoddiness is a part of the 
pattern," she said. 

Mulder worries the only 
inspections that have taken place 
have been through their own archi- 
tect - not independent or state 
inspections. That's her fear. 

"If they don't take care of it 
and some student does get really 
sick - or God forbid a fire happens 

- my point is let's try to fix these 
things before students move in," 

But the troubles between the 
labor situation and the universities 

- IPFW and Purdue - shouldn't 
have anything to do with the alle- 
gations of shoddiness. 

"Purdue's position has always 
been labor issues will get resolved. 
The money has been withheld by 
the contractors. That'll get 
addressed ... contractors are bond- 
ed and they'll lose their bonding it 
they don't address all the prob- 

And if anything was obvious, 
Danielson said it would have been

information. II'IVV asks thai specific information about the allegations be given; Labor Studies asks for 
a release of all inspections thus far. Both are right in their requests, but neither seems to have any inten- 
tion to contact the other. 

The accusation is serious, and both sides claim to have the best of intentions for the situation: the 
students. Not lo slaughter a cliche, but it's actions and not words. The fact that Labor Studies hasn't 
emailed or pln-i.allv delivered their declared evidence to administration officials bruises their claims 
as much as the administration's inaction in going to the office of Labor Studies and requesting copies 
for their purposes 

It's not like these two entities are far apart. They're both located m Keltler Hall. 

But even though their physical distance and mutual goal of protecting students are shared, the 
le.uleis ol these two communities need a lew lessons usually learned by middle school. 



Sacrifice 



mental inteii-ib. and emotional dedication lo make it through Special Forces training. He signed up 
for the worst of the worst, because that is where he fell he could make the best difference. 

Tillman sacrificed any early glory, refusing lo do interviews about the subject because he didn't 
want his patriotism made to look like as a publicity stunt. Patriotism is a very personal thing, and he 
didn't want that famished. 

Like SO many our military have done, he sacrificed his time anil energy during which he could be 
spending with his wife in the warmth ol Arizona. He traded it for the threats of military service dur- 



ing a 



eofv 



Ultimately, he sacrificed more than most. A: 
Action. Pew details are known so tar, but he i 
when be was apparently shot and killed. 

Tillman wanted to be treated just like the rest of those serving in the military. He didn't have any 
pipe dream thai be should receive benefits because of his background or monetary sacrifice. He just 
wanted to be with bis team when they needed him to help out any way he could. It wasn't a matter 
of pride, it was a matter of personal need. He wanted to go beyond the norm and make an impact. 

Some wonder why Tillman's death was such a story, but it's not because of what necessarily gave 
up. It was what he gave. He gave his time and talents, just like so many others in military service. His 
death, in the larger eontevt, isn't any more tragic than any other militarv member killed in any of our 
conflicts, tint by stepping forward and taking on a role few others of his stature considered, Tillman 
In-line .i bigger man in the nation's eyes - and an adopted loiisin lo Iho-e who respected his deci- 
sion. His death hits close to home because many of us feel related to Tillman, if only in our admiration 
of his life. Tillman isn't any more or less special than the thousands of others also serving - he just has 
a larger family. 

Tillman wanted to be treated just like the rest of those serving in the military. And he will be. His 
I will be honored, his sacrifice known. He will be laid to rest with a flag-draped coffin and 
s hero in his time. 




Word of the Week: 
Deed 



The Boy Scouts do it. The Carl Scouts do it. I do it. 

It's the Good Deed of the Day. 

Our fellow man needs help on almost a daily basis. The help required is usu- 
ally something small - carrying a computer out to a car, for example - and Our 
bellow Man could probably manage by himself. However, he'd be done a lot 
faster if someone would give him a hand and help him carry out the monitor. 
In return, that someone would have both made a friend, contributed to socie- 
ty in some small way, and gotten the warm fuzzies for being a good person. 

It takes hardly any time at all to complete a Good Deed of the Day. All that's 
required is someone in need of help and a few minutes to give him or her a 
hand. The quintessential example, of course, is helping elderly women cross 
the street. However, there is no abundance of grandmothers wandering 
around waiting to cross streets, so substitutions can be made. Help with small 
tasks such as carrying items cleaning, lending a dime or two, or even some- 
thing as small as returning a smile and a brief hello can count as a Good Deed 
of the Day. 

There are also Good Deeds ot the Week, Month and Year. These tasks are of 
such magnitude of helpfulness that they fulfill the Karmic quota for good 
deeds for more than just a day. For example, running down a purse-snatcher 
and returning Hie purse unmolested would be a Good Deed of the Month. A 
Good Deed of the Week would be something less significant - perhaps clean- 
ing out a relative's garage or bab\ sitting unpaid -and a Good Deed of the Year 
would most likely require saving a life. 

There are main benefits lo performing a Good Deed. Good Deeds can make 
up for anything bad one has done in the past to others (lying to your mother, 
kicking puppies, things of this sort), but remember, they can not be put on 
credit for future bad actions Good Deeds tend to cause the giver to feel more 
worthy and accomplished, often result in friendships to be formed, and, of 
course, gives one the "warm fuzzies," an overall sense of wellbeing. 

What must be understood about the Good Deed of the Day is that it is impo- 
lite to go about telling people what you've |ust done. It's not a Good Deed if 
you seek recognition for if then il ceases to become a Good Deed. By defini- 
tion the Good Deed is something done solely for one person, and not shared 
with the world in general The Good Deed is meant to help you like yourself, 
not to help others like you. 

In a perfect world, Good Deeds are performed on a daily basis. However, 
since you can't go looking for a Good Deed (this defeats the purpose, as it is 
the same as seeking recognition for your Good Deed) you must wait for Good 
Deeds to come to you. They only come along three or four times a week. It's 
not absolutely necessary to help even single person who asks, of course: you 
only have to help when you think you should. This is. a practice in self-disci- 
pline. You don't ever have to help anyone. But if you've got any kind of self- 
respect, you will help at least a majority of the people who ask. 

Good Deeds are small and simple, but they can make a profound effect on 
the people around us. If we all did a Good Deed even one day a week, the 
world would be a much Inendlicr place You never know who you are helping 
and what kind of advantage or InencKhip can blossom from this brief interac- 
tion. It's really not too large of an inlrusion into your day and while there is no 
one tooting horns about how wonderful you are for helping, you must remem- 
ber: what goes around, comes around.

Arguments for limiting 
abortions invalid 



By Tim Rodgers 

The Communicator 



Polls strong] v suggest that most 
Americans favor abortion rights, 
but there's great disagreement 
over how to limit the procedure. 
People think that laws or rules 
should lower the bar on the 
number of abortions. While some 
people believe a woman should 
have the right to terminate her 
fetus at any point until birth, oth- 
ers think the operation should be 
forbidden after a certain term — 
the sixth month being one of the 
most common opinions. But it's 
far more logical and practical to 
allow a mother (or 
father /guardian) to terminate a 
fetus until adulthood. 

Supporters of time limits 
express a silly viewpoint. How is 
a fetus more of a human being at 
six months than at five months 
and thirty-one days? I mean, 
simply put does it contemplate 
the duality of man through those 
long days or does it dabble in 
home gardening techniques? I 
mean come on, it's a Hipping 
fetus! It can't buy property or 
drive a car! It can't make the 
decisions of a normal, conscious 
adult. And do not hit me with the 
"Oh, it's kicking" B.S Two words 
STIMULUS RESPONSE! What 
happens to your eyes when you 
shine a light in them? They 
dilate. I rest my case. 

Of course, depending on the 
actual fifth month this time will 
vary. What if it is February? And 
a leap year? Whoa, nellie! That 
will throw the entire system off! 
If a baby is due at the end of the 
ninth month and the month hap- 
pens to be February, and a leap 
year, thus prompting the baby lo 
come at the beginning ol May 
like yours truly, would the fetus 
be ticketed? Unauthorized 
birthing, maybe? 

Supporters of unrestricted 
abortions also suffer from logic 



problems. They say a fetus 
becomes human at birth because 
only then is it independent of the 
mother. But how in the hell is it 
independent if it still must be 
fed, clothed, and sheltered by the 
mother/father/guardian. ..etc 
Until it's an adult it's as depend- 
ent for parental support as when 
it was in the womb. That's why 
it's a tax deduction. 

Until adulthood, fetuses are so 
subhuman, they're denied basic 
rights and liberties: they can't 
vote, drink alcohol, kill, procras- 
Hnate, get a job, buy a car, apply 
for a loan and get bothered by 
those damn census takers. In 
some states, they can't even visit 
a comedy club. I think that to 



"The Right To Life." Life in itself 
is such an abstract thing; it's real- 
ly what you make it and if all 
you can do is float around in a 
vat of gelatinous ooze for nine 
months, you ain't got much of 

By allowing abortion until 
adulthood, parents will be able 
to weed out wayward fetuses. 
They will be bale to hash out the 
slackers and non-conformists, 
thus making sure that they get a 
productive and aspiring sapling 
on their hands. Not some hellion 
who will stay out all night, 
shooting pool and pushing 
'Ludes. That threat alone should 
be enough to set a fetus on the 
right course: "Either you clean 
up your act, young man (or 
woman), or we're taking the 
clothes hanger to you so help me 
God!" On the other hand, a few 
parents may drown their fetuses 
in bathtubs simply to protect 
them from Satan and other vari- 
ous bad things. But who are we 
to judge? After all, morality is 
relative, right? The Nazis proved 
that. Pro Choice IS Pro- 
American Way. Seriously, we kill 
?rything else, why not clean 



up.

End of year car pranks 
sometimes go over the line 



Ah, it's graduation time and 
many people are ready to leave 
their lasting impressions on their 
fellow friends and family. Some 
choose to leave with memories of 
school, parties, and education, 
while others choose to leave 
their mark with pranks. That's 
right; pranks. 
Now that it's getting 



its mark. I don't know how 
many times in high school my 
car or my house was toilet- 
papered. I also remember when 
the idiots would bring their 
paintball guns out and also leave 
their mark. Pranks are supposed 
to be made in all good fun. I'm 
sure that many of you have had 
one played on you, or you 
played one on someone else. I'm 
also sure that many of you have 
had your share of pranks gone 
wrong, where someone's car is 
left egged, covered in mustard, 
or in other cases, covered in 
green soap from the IPFW 
women's bathrooms. Who does- 
n't enjoy waking up to finding 
egg all over your garage, which 
results in you scrubbing the 
garage until your knuckles 
bleed, trying to gel frozen egg off 
of your garage door and car? 

Many people step over the line 
and don't realize it. Simple 
things like putting balloons and 



deal 



ilike 



ing. So, this brings 
question: what is going too far? 
Here are some rules that I have 
come up with on my own. I'm 
not saying that you have to abide 
by these rules, but they have 
helped me out in the long run. 

1. Absolutely never egg a car. 
Not only does it eat your paint, it 
smells terrible as well This is not 



hilarious, this is instead an invi- 
tation for your victim to plan 
"hellish revenge" on you. I guar- 
antee you that it will be ten times 

2. If you are going to soap a 
car, soap the windows. It's a 

mess trying to get to a job inter- 
view when there your car is com- 
pletely covered in Dawn's 
Dishwashing Soap. 

3. Don't paint ball a house. 
What you don't realize is, paint 
likes to stick to paint. Also, when 
you are paint balling, make sure 
you leave the premises. You 
don't want the neighborhood 
policeman to pull up and catch 
you leaving your mark on yet 
another unsuspecting house. 
This can result in fines to you, if 
you are caught. As college stu- 
dents, we need to hold on to our 
money, because the vast majority 
of us don't depend on mommy 
and daddy to pay for our things. 

4. Don't key cars. Enough 

5. Don't stick kitty litter in the 
vents by your windshield. It 
ruins the ventilation system in 
your car. No one wants to be 

stuck at hone on a sunny day 
because his or her car won't 

6. Never ever put sugar or 
water in a gas tank. The result of 
the sugar? It caramelizes on 
your cylinder heads and ruins 
your fuel injector. The heat melts 
the sugar into caramel and 
makes everything nice and 
sticky. No one wants to be 
stranded on 169 or 469 waiting 
on a tow truck to come get their 
car because it no longer will 

7. Shaving cream eats the 
paint. Multi-colored cars are not 
impressive to potential dates. 

So, here are just a few rules to 
you to keep in mind when you 
are ready to go out and prank. 
Make sure humor is your No. 1 
one motto, not revenge. 



End of year brings 
hope for future 



Well, it's nearly over — there 
isn't much more to say, is there? 

In some form or another we 
have all finally reached the end of 
the semester, and on the press 
date of this newspaper we will be 
in the middle of the last week of 
regular classes. The week after, 
only finals loom over us, threat- 
ening to do the final damage (or 
help) to our grades. 

I never believed that 1 would 
make it this far, mostly because I 
never allowed myself to look this 
far forward. But now as this is the 
last issue of the year, it is time to 
say goodbye to the four people 
who read my column. 

I am still in a bit of a shock; I 
can't believe the end of the 
semester is so close. This year 
closes out what is my first year of 
college. Like the majority of the 
people who attend this campus, I 
wanted to go somewhere else — I 
was accepted and nearly matricu- 
lated at St. Mary's College in 
South Bend. But like so many 
other students, financial con- 
straints dictated that I go to 
IPFW, whose application I sent in 
merely as a last resort. 

And so I started my first semes- 
ter of college, 18-years-old, still 
living at home, completely 
expecting to hate this campus 



It seems like such a long 
time from just a few months ago 
when I walked onto campus, car- 
rying my brand new books and 
fresh notebooks, excited but 
daunted by the challenge college 
was sure to pose. In the fall 
-I'lmsli t the buildings weie i on 
fusing, the people were weird 
and the amentias were lacking to 

Well now, I know the cam- 
pus by heart— the people are still 
weird and we still don't have ,i 
decent cafeteria — but it is not 
longer just "school," il is my 
school, my college, 

There is something familiar 
about the avenues on campus 
and the dark corridors of W.ilb 
that makes them more than just 
the streets that I walk every day. 
There are a hundred places on 
campus that now hold memories 
from adventures in class, or with 
The Communicator, or simply 
wandering around by myself. I 
can only hope that my high 
school friends, who looked at me 
with pity when I told them I was 
going to IPFW, can say the same 
thing about their university. 

A quick look back through 
the issues of The Communicator 
from this year revealed to me just 
how much happened on this little 
campus this year. The people 
who work for paper, the office 
itself, is so different from when I 



wrote that article. As I paged 

through more issues I thought of 
the memories of meeting U.S. 

Senator Richard Lugar, touring 
Channel 56, going to all of the 
Omnibus speakers, covering the 
dorm controversy, and my most 



uld have told me all of this 
would happen at IPFW, not even 
close to my first choice for col- 
lege, I would not have believed 

Like I said, this hasn't been the 
year that I thought it would; 
instead of hating this campus and 
being glad to have this year over, 
I am actually quite sad. As 
always, things have to change. 
Some of my friends are moving 
on lo bigger and better campuses. 
Some of my old friends are 
returning to IPFW from living 

At The Communicator, writ- 
ers and editors always seem to be 
constantly passing through. 
Things always seem lo be chang- 
ing, but now I am a year older (I 
will turn 19 on the day I take my 
folklore final). Every week of this 
semester held a challenge; some 
obstacle loomed over my life and 
promised my destruction. For 
some reason, I survived (well, 
everything except the upcoming 
finals). 

I don't know what the next year 
holds in store for me, but for the 
first time in a long lime, I'm look- 
ing forward to whatever is next 



New speed hump causing 
cracks, consternation 



As I tried to leave the W.ilb 
parking garage earlier this morn- 
ing, I sal in the drive, looking for 
a break in the seemingly endless 
stream of traffic. 

Finally, after approximately 
five minutes, an angel in a pow- 
der blue Buick waved me out into 
the inner-ring of the circle. 

What was the cause of this 
traffic-nightmare? Perhaps 



has had a spontaneous case of 
rigor mortis and can't physically 
move out of the middle of the 
road. Certainly there is a good 
reason as to why traffic has been 
backed up throughout the main 
artery of our beloved IPFW. 

And then I realized what it 
was. It was the GIANT FLIP- 
PING LUMP OF CEMENT IN 
THE MIDDLE OF THE MOTH- 
ERLOVTNG ROAD! 

One, when attaching the 
oxygen tank for the climb over 
Mt. Wartell as its lovingly called 
bv it's regular travelers, question 
m.mv things. Life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of a new underbody all 
cross the minds of those who wait 
for hours just to scale the sleep 

When someone says the 
word "speed bump," I automati- 
cally picture those run-down half 
bumps that litter America's park- 



scarred and mangled with the 
marks of a month's travels. If 
anyone cares anything about 
their car, they better gel enough 
momentum to get up and over 
th,*- 1 bump, bul save anything 
more than a crawl for the second 
class wimpy bumps around 
town. Anything more than that 
and you better be prepared for 
the repairs. 

I'm sure there must be a 
completely logk.il explanation as 
lo why someone would choose to 
block the flow of traffic through 
campus. Having a speed bump 
like that would certainly impede 
the success of campus high-speed 
car chases; I can see the adminis- 
trative concerns revolving 
around that issue. 

Some would argue the sole 
purpose is lo remind to slow 
down for the upcoming pedestri- 
ans this fall. If that's the case, 
why didn't they just install a slop 
sign? I mean, we have lo stop 
anyway, a slop sign would just 
save us all hundreds of dollars in 
underbody repairs for when we 
go more than two M.P.H over that 
pain-in-the-ass speed bump. If I 
were a pedestrian, I'd be more 
afraid ol falling oft the bump and 
breaking my leg, than having a 






eforr 



The only apparent purpose 
of this campus monstrosity is to 
complicate our lives even further, 
bv making campus traffic more 
obnoxious and impossible than it 



First of all, there's nothing to 
say that there are going to be 
enough people in Ihe "student 
housing" to warrant haying their 
own little crossing. Even if those 
people happen to move in, as 
soon as the weather is bad (that's 
every other day here in Fort 
Wayne for those not keeping 
track) they aren't going to walk 
their lazy asses lo campus. If I 
had the choice of walking 15 min- 



else who has a shred of 

The only consolation that 
our school could offer me, and 
I'm sure ihe rest ol you will agree, 
is lo grace us with one of the 
signs that are dotted across 
Purdue's main campus. For those 
of you not lucky enough to have 
ventured to the wonderful land 
of the Boilermakers, when they 
throw a load of cement and con- 
crete into Ihe middle of a busy 
highway, Ihey al least put a sign 
next to it lo make you smile. No, 
it doesn't say BUMP and lacks 
that wonderful safely orange hue, 
but is a regular, schoolbus yellow 
sign that says "Speed Hump," I 
know I'd be a little more amused 
as I waited in line to scrape the 
bottom of my car against a ton of

for the range of silent (but comedic) facial expressions

(played by Melissa Dowty) is a loud, animated 

grincess the exact opposite of the princess stereotype; 
owty creates a princess whose physical movements 
and presence on stage reflects this bumbling but 
adorable persona. 

However, the main characters were not the only

Blame it on Rio's most 
effort leaves the youth 



Following the 2niP&gt; release of their long delayed 
lull length "20 seconds rill 4 ever," Blame it on Rio has 
gone through many changes. 

Among those changes were the replacement of 
i drummer and bass player. Andrew Steininger took 



The third cut "Japan Quatro" runs a little long 
on the instrumental mtro, though that will be cut down 
a bit in editing from what 1 have been told Other than 
that, the group continues to showcase that more mature 
and put-together sound. 

The thing I do regret about this track is th 
because it seems like it would be phi 



recent

Lex Yoder became the bassist, 
time for the recording of 



ti emo-sounding Ira. k 



The most rea nl release, an E.P., will be released 
in Ma\ and -h.&gt;,\ • ■ \a-a improvement from Blame it vn 
Rio's last H [ease [he disc, which will be a split with 
Indianapolis based band Don't Fall Twice, will consist 
of live Blame it on Rio tracks. 

Before I go into the individual tracks and what 
they showcased, let me point out something that I truly 
enjoyed. The copy of the disc that I have contains the 
tracks before the songs have been mastered. However, 
the unmastered sound gives Blame it on Rio a rough 
and edgy sound. It's this indie rock vibe that I hope 
they don't let go too much in the post production 
process. 

The first track, "The Greatest Lie," is tops of the 



n the very first song. 

Another key draw of The Greatest Lie" is that 

all aspects are relevant. The drums, guitars and vocals 
are pretty near flawless. Hatfield and Katt show that 
everyone new and old is part of this band by sharing 
the spotlight with Steininger and Yoder. 

"Moon Shine' is vocally fantastic. Reminiscent 
of New Found Glory's Jordan Pundik, these vocals a 



of those 

tilings that vou really enjoy or it gets complcteh on 
your nerves There is no in-between for this track. And 
while the more uplifting nature of the instrunienials 
gets to me, they are still strong I hough "lapau Quatro 
is piobablv my leasl favorite track, because I disagree 
with the presentation, it is still solid. 

Then comes my absolute favorite track that 1 
have heanl from Blame it on Rio. Dreaming of you, my 
killer" reminds me a good deal of m\ favorite all-time 
local band All Pain Aside. 

If every song sounded like this, I would becon- 
: with the sound and I would easily become a strong 



"Right or Wrong, I'm Leaving." Perfect title for 

song and the perfect sound as well. The song is perfect 

for one main reason: it refuses to let the sound go bad. 

Nothing could make this E.P. fall short of the 
maturity that it captures. The Blame it on Rio of old 
truly is gone and the reincarnation is very good. 

I have been one of Blame it on Rio's biggest crit-

Afew months ago, I gut the notion that 
in order to understand film truly, it would be 
necessary for me to see all of the classics. 
With the exception of "Citi/en Kane," I was 
under the impression that all of the "clas- 
sics" were "classics" simply because they 
were old, and that over time the hype 
became bigger than the movie. And that is 



t few days later, when it appeared in my 
mailbox, I was hesitant to watch it. But 
reluctantly, I popped it in, in lieu of the 
"Jackie Brown: Collector's Edition" disc 1 
had been dying to watch that was lying next 
to the player. 1 sat back and was prepared 

Boy, was I wrong. "Casablanca" is 
everything it's touted to be and more. Since 
that first shut ol the spinning globe and the 
voice-over staling lh.it those who don't get 
their visas are forced to "wait in 
Casablanca... and wait... and wait... and 
wait." For those who don't know already, 
the film takes place in unoccupied Morroco 
during World War 11. A supposedly non- 
political bartender named Rick Blaine 
(Humphrey Bogart) gets by until an old 
flame comes into town (Ingrid Bergman as 
Ilsa) with her husband (Paul Henreid as 
Victor Laszlo), who are attempting to get 
visas so they can get to America. Set against 
the a Nazi-filled Casablanca, France, what 
follows is undoubtedly the greatest love tri- 
angle ever to grace the screen, not to men- 
tion the best ending ever. I know that 
"greatest love triangle ever to grace the 
screen" has got to make me sound so cliche, 
but that little phrase is said so much about 
this movie because it's true. Now I could 
wax philosophical all day about why this 
movie is so kick ass, but luckily I've nar- 
rowed it down to three solid reasons why 
"Casablanca" truly is the classic it is said to 
be. 

1. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid 
Bergman - Words escape me when attempt- 
ing to describe just how am.i/ing these two 
really are. First off. Bogie. Much like the 
character he played in 1941 's "The Maltese 
Falcon," Bogart's Rick Blaine struggles with 
" "s the right thing 

' , yo 



it is, Bergman gels it done She holds that 
rare quality ut being so off the th.irts beauti- 
ful but yet seems accessible, like you almost 
have a chance with her if you were to meet 
her in real life. Of course deep down you 
know it would never happen, but when the 
holds on her heavenly gaze you 



bell. 



Dbeb 



2. The quotes - There are so main quotable 
moments in "Casablanca" it's difficult to 
name them all. But in an effort to show you 
just how main cikhphrases were bom in 
this movie, I'll attempt to name them all. 

"We'll always have Paris." Bogie says 
this when convijuing lls.i to board the plane 



Bogart says this 



n't help 
i don't know if 



enough, by the end of the movie you are in 
awe of him but at the same time hating your- 
self for ever doubting him in the first place 
There's that first shot of Rick in the gambling 
room, him playing chess, alone, with an 
empty glass next to him. Rick is so cold and 
mean to Ugarte when he speaks of his exit 
visas, but we sympathize with Rick, because 
we get the feeling he's cold for a reason. 
Even when Rick says "I stick my neck out for 
nobody" the audience knows that's just an 
act and that no doubt Rick does stick his 
neck out, just when it matters the most. 

Ingrid, Ingrid, Ingrid. "Casablanca" 
requires a minimum of two viewing: one for 
the movie and one so you can keep your 
eyes on Ilsa. Before watching "Casablanca," 
Bergman would be nowhere near the top of 
my list of leading ladies. But now I am con- 
fident in saying that Bergman's Ilsa Lund 
Laszlo is the most beautiful face on film, 
ever. Maybe it's those close-ups under the 
soft light when she asks Sam to play "As 
Time Goes By," maybe it's how she looks in 
that hat during the airport finale. Whatever 



.itler closing time. 

"Here's looking at you, kid." This line 
appears a few times throughout the film. 
Now I have personally heard this line so 
many times before, it's almost maddening 
But when Bogart says it, it feels like the Erst 

"Play it, Sam." This one is often mis- 
quoted as "Play It Again, Sam." Wrong lls.i 
never says that Someone should have told 
Woody Allen this, however. He starred in a 
1972 film entitled "Play It Again, Sam" 
where the ghost of Bogart haunts him, Um, 
yeah.., no wonder none of us have heard of 



However, there are few that 1 think 
thy. 

"I stick my neck out for nobody." 
Bogart says this after refusing to help Ugarte 
escape the officers. 

"Everybody tries. You succeed." This 
may be my favorite line in the entire film. 
Bogart says it to Laszlo after he tries mod- 
estly to brush oil his Resistance work. Ever 
since seeing that scene, I've been waiting for 
the moment when 1 can use it in real conver- 
sation and pawn it off as my own. But until 
that time comes, I'll have to' settle for saying 
it into the mirror along with the rest of the 
quotes. 

3. The supporting cast - Never has a sup- 
porting cast been so loveable. Usually, in 
love triangles the audience falls in love with 
the main character and grows to hate the 
other man vying for the woman's love. In 
"Casablanca" that is not the case. Although 
we're rooting for Rick, we all know that 
Laszlo just as worthy of Ilsa's love. This is 
proven in the scene where he sings the 
anthem over the Nazi's singing in the bar. If 
1 would have known the words I would 
have gotten up and sang along. 

Even the bad guys are great. Strasser, 
the Nazi general who bulls heads lv ith Kick 
in the end, is definitely the evil in the film. 
However evil he is, there are shades to his 
character that are appealing. This fresh look 
at the antagonist has been lost for many 
years, probably due to the fact that 
I lolb wood thinks that all bad guys should 
be one dimensional horrific people. 

So there you have it, three reasons why 
you haven't lived until you' 



quote I heard recently: "If don't lov&gt; 
Casablanca, then you just don't get it. 
Enough said.

Freshmen engineering students inspire Tar Pit Park 

3 projects win 
$1,000 to see 
to completion 



Freshmen at IPFW can make 
an impact, and have this school 
year through a project with the uni- 
versity. 

Through the Engineering, 
Technology and Computer Scien.e 
Department, ovei 45 designs were 

tlon. The first placed) dgnwaapre 

sented at a groundbreaking cere- 
mony Monday in a grassy area 
between Kcttlcr Hall and Parking 
Lot No. 3. 

Engineering, Technology and 
Computer Science Dean Gerard 
Voland called it "a new tradition" 
hoping to help the university and 
the students through the experi- 
ence of students. 

Professor Somnath 

C hattaadhyay had his freshman 
classes evaluate what could be 
done for IPFW with their fresh eyes 
to improve the campus environ- 

The winning design is called 
"Tar Pit Park" and will incorporate 
picnic tables and areas for bocce 
ball along with horseshoe pits near 
Kettler and the ET building. It was 
a concept proposed by IPFW fresh- 
men Mark Adams, Nick Sorg and 
David Clendenen. 

"This competition dues a nice 
fob of reflecting the ability, the cre- 
ativity, the practicality and think- 
ing of our students," Voland said. 



Along with the fir&gt;) place, two 
olhei designs finished in the top 
fnu .iin I in i iv ed SI, 000 funding. 

The first design was to install 
new safety mirrors in all the park- 
ing garages. 

"We have greater safety now 
in our parking garages," Voland 
said.

The trio, all graduates of New

friends, brainstormed the idea one 
morning while e.iting rJurgi-i King 

It wasn't exactly what they were 
thinking file trio thought it would 
be nice to have the park area 
between Kettler Hall and 
Classroom Medical, but the school 
had other thoughts. They didn't 
know until Monday morning 
where it is actually going to be 
located. 




IPFW freshmen Mark Adams, Nick Sorg and David Clendenen hold up signs showing 
off their designs for Tar Pit Park Monday and look on during a ceremony marking the 
initiation of the project. The trio, all graduates of New Haven High School, had their 
design choosen over 45 others to receive university funding to see it to completion. Two 
other projects from students were also selected.

"They'll finally find some use 
for this area and hopefully people 
will get some use to it," Adams 
said. 

In concept, thousands could 
be utilizing Tar Pit Park over the 
next decade, they hope. 

"We wanted something that 
everybody could enjoy," 

Clendenen said.

We've been pretty much been limit- 
ed to indoor stuff with pool tables

For Sorg, he agreed with 
Voland's contention that the project 
brings students and the university 



"It'll make us a part of this 
campus instead of just going here," 
Sorg said. 

The project will continue 
through each semester, Voland 
said. The competition for spring is 
already underway. 

"Hopefully we haven't run 
out of issues and ways that we can 
enhance the campus and we'll have 
a similar ceremony in the future," 
Voland said. 



The other projects were devel- 
oped by Syed Ali, James Franklin, 
Kevin Spieth, Keith Douge and 

Justin Rentfrow. 

It is the Dean's hope to 
encourage these ideas to continue 
through the years. 

"Those of us in these profes- 
sions have one goal: to improve the 
quality of life for ourselves and for 
our community through technolo- 
gy," Voland commented.

While possibly an anomaly, there 
was only one report of indecent 
exposure during 2003. 

The two reported incidents 
this quarter both took place during 
the first part of the morning. 
Officials believe it was the same 
individual, but haven't taken any- 
one in custody for the behavior. 
DenHaitog noted witnesses to any 
suspect or illegal activities need to 
attempt to gather some informa- 
tion for police, if safety allows it. 

"If people get some of the 
basics, a license plate or what (a 
suspect) is wearing, it helps us 
solve these," he said. 

Personal thefK are also higher 
than a year ago during the same 
reporting period. Between March 
and January 2003, there were nine 
reports; this year, there were 18. 
That is on pace to pass last year's 
total of 92 reports of personal theft 
at IPFW. 

"A lot of those (current) thefts 
aren't large thefts, but they are 
thefts," DenHartog said, stressing 
people on campus need to be more 
vigilant with their belongings. 

There were four reports of 
vandalism/criminal mischief dur- 
ing the 2004 reporting period thus 
far, as opposed to just one during 
the same timeframe in 2003. 

Not all numbers were higher, 
however. Personal injuries during 
the timeframe were down by 50 
percent, from eight reports in 2003 
to four documented during 2004. 
Thefts of university property were 
also down by half - from four in 
2003's first quarter to two in 2004's 
first three months. 

Reports of automobile crashes 
have also risen, from a dozen in the 



first quarter 2003 to 20 during the 
same time period in 2004. It's 
something police are well-aware 
of, but don't see any problem inter- 
sections where more accidents 
have taken place. Instead, it's a 
simple matter of a math equation. 
"With the increase of more 
cars on campus, you're going to ' 
have more accidents," DenHartog 

He did note the department is 
taking action already to prepare for 
having responsibilities at the 

Walerlicld Student Housing. 

"We'll be over there - we're in 
the process of adding officers and 
training for that purpose," he said. 

And, at least initially, the stu- 
dent housing is going to be a dry 
campus. Like the university itself, 
students will not be allowed to 
have alcohol on the property. To 
bring alcohol onto IPFW for 
events, special permission and fees 
must be paid. At Waterfield, alco- 
hol will not be allowed. 

Punishment for the violation 
will depend on the situation. If the 
person isn't of legal drinking age, 
or is impaired in public, it would 
become a criminal court case. But, 
he said, if it violates school policy, 
it'll go through the university's 
Dean of Students and those in 
charge of the housing facility. 

DenHartog, who has been 
with campus police since 1976, said 
there have been other peaks in 
criminal activities through his time 
here, but nothing extremely con- 
cerning in recent years. 

"We've had our times when 
things have happened, but on the 
whole, we're a safe campus," he

Those interested can contact 
the group by emailing 
HiUielcnganization@yahoo.com. 

Another international organi- 
zation wanting to make a local 
impact is the Lion's Club 

Greg Jeffrey, past council 
chairman and past district gover- 
nor of Lion's Club of northeast 
Indiana, explained the organiza- 
tion wants to emphasize increasing 
involvement of younger members 
of the community. 

In the last year. Lion's Clubs 
have been started at Taylor, Butler 
and Manchester universities IPFW 



Conti 

is where the regional Lion's Club 
wants to start another organization 

for college students 

At IPFW, the Lion's Club has 

done several events showing their 
involvement and trying to recruit 
Most college Lion's Clubs have 
between 30 and 35 members, 
Jeffrey said. 

"We're approaching half 
that," he noted. 

The mission of the Lion's Club 
is volunteerism, and is the largest 
service organization in the world, 
Jeffrey said. 

Their primary mission is tra- 
ditionally helping with sight and 
sight-related deficiencies. 

"We're here to bring Lionism 
- and offer that as an experience to 
students. Along the way &gt; t 1 1 offer 
them some leadership opportuni- 
ties," he said. 

Among the club at IPFW, 
members see the I. ions as a way of 



being giving back. 

"We enjoy meeting new peo- 
ple and getting involved with the 
community It's great," freshman 
Alfredo Contreras explained, The 
elementary education major thinks 
more people should be involved in 
campus organizations. 

For those organizing Lions, it 
is a chance to help the community. 

"I've always done service - I 
was part of a service fraternity 
while in college," MBA graduate 
student Lucas Amodio explained. 
"I wanted to get back involved and 
I like how the money goes back to 
where it comes from," he added. 

For sophomore Sarah Lash, 
the Lions is a way of volunteering 
for the community. "I wanted to 
get involved with something 
where I could give back," she said.

groups can contact Student Life in

week," is prifTU' lime for sludenls In 
catch up on reading and work as a 
good deal of classic a re light on the 
pre-finals work. During this week, 
the campus is either quilc empty as 
students stay at home to work in 
quiet, or it is jam packed to all 
hours of the morning, with com- 
puter labs overflowing with 

And while studying may be 
the obvious choice, many others 
try lo take their minds off of the 
impending lesls, papers and essays 
thai they will endure as pari of Ihe 
dreaded finals week. 

"Finals are always so stressful 
to me and probably to everyone. 
We all study, bul at the same time, 
every person's brain needs a 
break," said sophomore Kevin 
Windmeyer. "It never hurls lo take 
an hour or two lo break out Ihe 
Playstation 2 or be la/v and watch 
TV." 

Whatever the way is lhat each 
;sludent deals with Ihe slress asso- 
with finals, professional 
educators warn that it is 
I. ml In relieve some of the 
n lhat occurs with these 



Health Educator Sarah Hansen 
suggests lhat sludents make rime 
for themselves, find a relaxation 
lechnique or exercise routine that 
Ihey truly enjoy and benefit from 
and schedule time for it, especially 
during finals week. 

According lo her suggestions 
on the University of Iowa Health 

(uisrudenthealth.com) the slep of 
relaxation is "crucial in blowing off 
steam before you reach Ihe 'boiling 
over' point." 

Other than the anxiousness 
and worried nature of their peers, 
most sludents around campus will 
notice that the attendance seems to 
be up in classes in the weeks lead- 
ing up to final exams. 

"Nobody is going to skip at 
crunch time," said Windmeyer. "I 
don't go lo class all of the time, but 
the last three weeks are too crucial 
to miss." 

After finals are complete, stu- 
dents who will be taking courses 
for credit during the first summer 
session will have only a week to 
rest before the summer classes pick 
up on May 14. 

"I just wanl to gel my finals 
out of the way so that I can relax 



for a week. I have to take an 
English class for my major during 
Summer 1, so I desperately am 
going lo need that week," said 
freshman Marcus Pollock. "I just 
am trying to focus on finals though 



it overlook them. If 1 do that, 
t pass them." 



As well, many students have 
been making sure to put IPFW 
resources campus resources to 
good use. CASA, the Writing 
Cenler and even Helmke Library 
have begun lo see large increases in 
their use as finals loom. 

The first two of those services, 
both located in Kettler Hall, are 
mostly booked up until the very 
end of the semester. Even at the 
Writing Cenler, students are trying 
to get the finishing touches added 
lo their l.isl nu mitt 1 papers. 

"It (the writing center) is a 
great tool lo use. Though I am not 
using it anymore this semester, it 
has helped me out a good deal," 
s.ud Windmeyer. 

As the semester draws to a 
close, students and faculty alike 
look forward to a break. However, 
all parties are weary, making sure 
that this headache of exams is not 
[heir lin.il headache.

'Dons drop CSU 



By IPFW News Services 

The IPFW baseball team 
jumped out to a big early lead on April 
22 against the Chicago State Cougars 
and coasted to a 13-0 shutout of the 
Cougars. 

With the win, IPFW won the 
season series, 2-1, after the two teams 
split a double-header at Mastodons 
Field earlier this month. 

IPFW took advantage of three 
CSU errors to score four runs in the sec- 
ond inning off Cougars freshman start- 
ing pitcher Jonathan Duncan for a 4-0 
lead. 

The Mastodons increased the 
lead to 5-0 in the sixth inning after sec- 
ond baseman Brent Alwine ripped an 
RBI single off Duncan to left field that 
brought home Tyler Fowler. 

Fowler later ripped an RBI sin- 
" i the seventh "

in the ninth inning off CSU relievers, 
sophomore Scott Fritzler and freshman 



with an RBI, while Brandon Armstrong 
was 3-for-5 with two RBI for IPFW. 

Starting pitcher Jason Horvath 
(3-7) earned the win, tossing a complete 
game with nine strikeouts and 
for the Mastodons. 

For the game, CSU left eight 
runners on base, committed five 
and recorded four stolen bases. IPFW 
left 12 runners on base, recorded four

With the loss, CSU falls to 4-33

Good for the Supreme Court. They 
saved the National Football League. Or did 

I never second guessed my theory on 
Maurice Clarett being the anti-Christ of foot- 
ball. Not once until the week of this NFL 
draft. Then Eli Manning sought to steal 
Clarett's thunder. 

Good job, Eli. Way to contribute to your 
family's long time pmblcm of being childish. 
I guess Daddy doesn't help that stereotype 
much either though. 

So Eli, Archie and probably even 
Peyton.. .they all got their little way. The 
Chargers called the Manning bluff and draft- 
ed Eli No. 1. Then, as per the Manning wish, 
they traded him to the Giants. 

One problem. The New York fans at 
Madison Square Garden (home of the draft) 
didn't seem to be too fond of Eli either. 

Way to outcast the west coast and the 
east coast. You must have learned it from 
Peyton. Maybe next, you can accuse your 
kicker of alcoholism. No? 

These whiny little amateur athletes, 
they bother me more than anything else 
about college sports. 

I have a secret. People like Eh Manning, 
they are amateurs, and by no means do they 
have the right In have any sa\ on who drafts 

Chargers General Manager A.J. Smith 
and Coach Marty Schottenheimer have been 
Jomg this frir a while. I think thev know how 
to do their jobs If Eli's daddy Archie really 
wants to have a say in how any team runs its 
own operations, maybe he should buy his 
own team. If not, he can shut his mouth and 
keep spending his children's money while 
wondering why he sucked as a proft 
quarterback. But that's just one idea. 




loll rev Reynolds. 

Who it really hurt was Mike Williams, 
the former USC standout. Because he has 
nothing to show tor himself. All Willi 
did was enter himself in the draft as he 
legally able to do at the time that he did 

Williams can and will play at an 1 
level. He would have been a first round pick 
this year, but now he has to sit out a year or 
play in Canada. 

Williams loses big. Clarett was already 
lost long ago. 

Other than Eli, the draft was pretty pos- 
Good players going where ' 



i the theme. And 



needed and used oftt 

My favorite and best moves of the draft, 
pretty simple: 

1) Pittsburgh Sleelers draft Ben 
Roethlisberger at thirteen. Roethiisberger 
will have an immediate impact and was my 
favorite quarterback in the draft. 

2) Arizona Cardinals fill two voids. By 
drafting Larry Fitzgerald at four and then 
Michigan quarterback John Navarre in 
Round 2, Arizona has made their team far 
better. Navarre will be needed when Shaun 
King undoubtedly starts nla\ ing like Crap. 



1) Eli Manning. Enough said. 

2) Cleveland Browns forget that they 
need a quarterback. Okay, why Kellen 
Winslow? Anyone? They could use a wide 
receiver. But no Roethlisberger? No J.P. 
Losman? There is no wonder why the owner 
moved them before. 

That's that folks. Whining, smiling. 
Welcome to the NFL.
