Faculty 

recognized 

with 

awards, 

promotions 



by PaulTupper 
Editor 

Twenty-two IPFW faculty 
members have reasons to cele- 
brate, and not because summer is 
here The trustees of Indiana 
University and Purdue 
/ersity. in separate actions, 
approved changes in title and sta- 
tus; effective July 1. 

Heading the list is W. Jeffrey 
Wilson of psychological sciences, 
who has been promoted to full 
professor, the highest ranking a 
faculty member can achieve. 

'It feels good. It's a culmina- 
tion of bard work." said Wilson, 
who will not use bis promotion to 
seek an administrative position, 
preferring teaching and doing 
research. 

Wilson began leaching at 
IPFW in the fall of 1984. just one 
year after earning bis Ph.D in 
psychology at UCLA Much of 
Wilson's work is shared with his 
students, to who he gives co- 
author credit when assisting with 
publications 

Assistant professors who were 
promoted to associate professor 
including tenure are: Bernd I. 
Fischer, history; Linda C. Fox, 
modern foreign languages; 
Beverly A Hume. English; and 
Lawrence A. Ku/nar anthro- 
pology. 

Promoted with tenure are: 
Robert M Berger, chemistry. 
Ronald J. Duchovic, chemistry; 
Opal A. Frciburger. nursing; 
Roger D Hack, engineering. 
Craig A Humphrey, theatre; 
George W. Kalamaxas, English; 
Carol A. Lawton, psychology; 
Zhongming W Liang, manufac- 
turing technology; Vincing M. 
Maloney, chemistry; Kimberly S. 
McDonald, organizational leader- 
ship and supervision; John S, 
Minion, English; Kathleen L 
O'Connell, nursing; Hosscin M 
Oloomi, engineering; Yifei Pan. 
mathematics, Carol S 
Stembcrgcr. nursing; and David 
L. Tumispeed, management. 

Sternbcrger is pleased to be 
included in the company of new 
(enures "My colleagues recog- 
nize 1 have been a good educa- 
tor," said Stemberger. who cele- 
brated the occasion with family, 
including brother-in-law 

Duchovic. 

Also granted tenure was 
Jeanne T Baronc, instructor of 
communication. It is rare for 
instructors to achieve tenure, an 
honor usually bestowed on pro- 
fessors 

Achieving tenure gives educa- 
tors job security, a pay increase 
and prestige 

In other honors, IPFW's chap- 
ter of Sigma Xi recently named 
W Douglas Weakley, of electri- 
cal engineering. Teacher of the 
Year and Mohammad S. Alam, of 
mathematical sciences, and Elliott 
J Blumenthal, of biology, 
Researchers of the Year. Sigma

society that emphasizes scientific 
research

Beering denies grievance 



Ryan's future still 
uncertain as decision 
to rehire passes to 
Wartell, Scudder 



by Nol Beckley 
Managing Editor 

Purdue President Steven 
Beering has denied Jack 
Ryan's grievance in a letter 
written to the members of the griev- 
ance committee, but he also reaf- 
firmed "IPFW's right to decide 
whom it wants to appoint as associ- 



ate faculty mem- 
bers." 

In a letter to the 
grievance com- 
mittee, Beering 
said, "With this 
decision. 
Chancellor 
(Michael) Wartell 
and the Associate 
Vice Chancellor for Academic 
Affairs may consider Mr. Ryan for 
reappointment in future semesters." 
According to Wartell. the deci- 
sion to rehire Ryan is now Mary 
Scudder's, coordinator of the 
human services department, and 
Fenwick English's, vice chancellor 
of academic affairs. There has not 



been a decision rendered as of press 
lime. 

"I'm not going to comment on 
lhal until I talk to my superiors." 
Scudder said. 

English said whether Ryan can 
be rehired is still under administra- 
tive review and that most of ihe fall 
classes already have faculty 
assigned to them. The administra- 
tion would have to then figure out 
which courses needed an instructor. 
According to English, Ryan would 
be able to apply for any of the 
courses which are open. 

Joseph Bennett, vice president of 
university relations at Purdue, said 
it would be inappropriate for 
Beering to demand that a faculty 



member be hired al IPFW. He also 
said Beering was not asked by the 
committee to rule on any of Ihe 
grievances Filed by Ryan. 

Ryan said he was pleased with 
Bcering's ruling, but was disap- 
pointed that Beering did not direct 
IPFW to reinstate him. 

"I don't believe they've (Purdue) 
answered the questions raised in the 
hearing ... basically, non-tenured 
professors have no rights," Ryan 
said. 

Ryan's future has been at Ihe 
hands of Ihe university since he 
filed a grievance to be reinstated to 
his former position Ryan was not 
rehired as an associate faculty mem- 
ber after a student, Joyce Gaines.

lade an informal complaint to 
Mary Scudder, chair of the depart- 
ment of human services about 
remarks Ryan allegedly made lo 
Gaines 

Ryan has said he was informing 
the class to identify themselves bet- 
ter during a speech or ihey would be 
remembered by how they looked. 
Ryan admits he referred to Gaines 
as a "big, black woman" once. 

Gaines has said Ryan referred to 
her as a "big, black woman" on 
three different occasions. 

Gaines remained silent and suf- 
fered media scrutiny until she called 
The Communicator, which ran a 
column that referred to her criminal 
record. Gaines then sought a higher 
power in deciding to come forth 
with her story "1 prayed about il," 
said Gaines. 

Beering's decision has reaf- 
firmed Gaines dedication to Purdue, 
although she now attends St. 
Francis College. Gaines weni on to 
say, "I'm proud to be a part of 
Purdue ... Purdue has never failed 
me yet." 

According to Beering's letter, 
Ryan had no rights to be reinstated 
as an instructor on campus arid the 
university did nothing wrong, con- 
trary to the grievance committee's 
recommendation. 

The recommendation said, "The 
University's decision nol to reap- 
point Ryan was made in the absence 
of a pre-deprivation hearing and 
thus violates due process." The rec- 
ommendation also said a panel 
should have been assembled to 
determine whether or not a violation 
of the antibarrassment policy 
occurred. 

Beering responded by saying, "I 
have concluded that the University 
did not violate Mr. Ryan's rights to 
due process since there was no 
requirement lhal IPFW conduct a 
pre-deprivation bearing upon decid- 
ing not lo renew bis contract." 



St. Francis coach replaces Piazza 



by Jim Porler 
Sports Editor 

A new excitement reigns over 
the men's basketball program. After 
six weeks of carefully scrutinizing 
and evaluating more than 100 appli- 
cations, officials have named John 
Williams as the new head mens 
basketball coach. 

Williams comes to IPFW from 
neighboring St. Francis College 
where he coached for four seasons 
Compiling a 59-62 record, be 
turned an also-ran team into a 
National Association of 
Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) 
achiever. Last season Williams 
guided the Cougars to a number 1 7 
national ranking. He also served as 
the athletic director while al St. 
Francis , 

"Me and my family are very 
excited about being here." Williams 
said "We are looking forward to 
something really big " 

Williams said the opportunity to 
be associated with one of the coun- 
try's premier NCAA Division II 
conferences was one thing that 
excited him about coming to IPFW 
Uvcr the past three seasons, the 
Great Lakes Valley Conference has 
been rated as one of the most com- 
petitive conferences in the nalion. 

The road will not be easy With 



the end of Ibis years recruiting sea- 
son looming on tbe horizon, 
Williams knows that he has a great 
amount of work to do. 

"1 will be very busy," he said, "I 
have to hit tbe road and do some 
recruiting." 

A fact that makes Williams' 
recruiting task a bit easier is that a 
few of his former players from St. 
Francis may follow him to play for 
the 'Dons. 

"There will probably be a few 
players who will transfer," 
Williams said. 

Due to NCAA regulations, the 
coach could not elaborate or discuss 
specific players. However, he did 
indicate that he sees a need for 
quicker, stronger players who can 
"play above the rim " 

"We are going to get the ball up 
and down the floor," Williams said. 
"We will press and make teams 
play the whole 94 feet." 

Williams began his coaching 
career as an assistant at Ball State 
University in 1982 In 1985 he 
moved to NCAA Division III 
Earlham College to serve as head 
coach He served at Earlham until 
1989 when he look a NCAA 
Division I assistant's position under 
Head Coach Steve Yoder at the 
University of Wisconsin-Madison. 

The Richmond, Ind. native grad- 



uated from Richmond High School 
in 1977. He garnered first team ali- 
conference and honorable mention 
all-state honors in his senior season 
as he helped ihe Red Devils lo a 20- 
5 record. 

Williams' collegialc playing 
days were spent al Ball Slate where 
he helped lead the Cardinals lo its 
first NCAA Tournament appear- 
ance. He was a ihree-iimc All-Mid- 
Amcrican Conference honorable 
mention selection and was inducted 
into the BSU Athletic Hall of Fame 
in 1992. 

The father of two children. 
Nicholas (5) and Chezni (2). 
Williams said that possibly the most 
difficult aspect of his move lo 
IPFW may be convincing his 
daughter the school's mascot, "Don 
the Mastodon," isn't really all that 
frightening. 

Williams officially begins his 
coaching dunes on July 1, 1996.

An open letter 10 my older broth- 
er, a recent 'Don graduate: 

Ah, the advent of post-gradua- 
tion doldrums has been sent upon 
us, and as the lazy Tew pathetic 
individuals sit around ma and pa's 
basement looking for something to 
do with that General Studies 
degree, others have begun to seek 
out real-life employment Whether 
it's working as a Bible translator in 
the Yukon or finding that special 
someone to mooch off of for a life- 
time, once wc have that sheet of 
thin mulch in our hands we affec- 
tionately refer to as a diploma, wc 
must put our brains to work to find 



a career 

Most 
graduates set 
forth immedi- 
ately to seek 
out that dream 
job: being [hat 
scientist who 
finds a cure for 
hat-head or 
becoming a 
computer pro- 
grammer who 
makes a system 
with a solitaire 
game that is actually beatable. 
Others strive for the less notable: 
working with janitorial services at 
Brunswick Bowling Lanes or per- 
haps even the prestige of becoming 
an assistant manager at Handy 
Dandy. 

I'd like to impart to you my 
young wisdom concerning what to 
do upon the completion of that 
seven-year college experience. As I 
tossed and turned in my sleep last 
night. Lyle Lovett appeared to me 
in a vision to share a bit of his sage 
and instruction with a young pupil 
such as myself. This is the story of 



thai encounter. 

1 was awakened to the sound of 
some big hair scratching at my 
door Tripping over piles of stale 
glazed donuts and a half-eaten Arch 
Deluxe from McDonald's (what's 
the deal with McDonald's growing 
up anyway ' Do they have Ronald 
McDonald as a bouncer standing at 
the door asking for IDs?), 1 reached 
for the door handle and was sur- 
prised to find THE MAN standing 
outside Lyle looked at me with 
those squiniy eyes and asked if he 
could come inside. Resistance was 
futile. The gravitational pull from 
bis, hair was sucking my once- 
thougbt-to-be immovable will, and 
within an instant he had wafted into 
my room. 

The first thing Lyle asked for 
was a sbff dnnk. Apparently he had 
just come from Funkylown 
University, where he had given a 
speech to a number of graduates 
there — including Superfly and Rick 
James. I whipped him up a good 
mix of orange juice, Worcestershire 
sauce and egg albumen and be 
slammed it like a Jack Daniel's 
When Mr Lovett had readied him- 



self, he began to bestow upon me 
the prudence that goes with being a 
star of his caliber. 

"I saw many good things during

me. "After graduation, careers 
begin immediately. The employ-

When I inquired as to how employ- 
ment could be over 100 percent, be 
said that the jazz band members 
there were so well-respected that 
they often ran for political office so 
they bad two jobs. He also men- 
tioned the figure would have been 
even higher but for some reason the 
people who worked at Papa John's 
in Funkylown didn't speak English 
so each one only counted as having 
,75 of a job. Then he told me to 
shut up and quit interrupting his 
story.

by Amanda M anion 
Features Editor 

It is now two weeks into sum- 
mer break and you are jobless. 
Your bank account screams in 
agony every lime you approach the 
ATM. You need a job and fast 
What do you do? What do you do? 

Oh, I don't know! What do I 
do 1 With a red felt-Uppcd pen and 
newspaper in band, I begin my 
search for employment. 

The want ads produce a wealth 
of information. Box after box 



reveals a factory job. secretarial or 
technical work Alas. I am nol 
qualified for most of them My two 
years of journalism classes have 
unfortunately not prepared me lo 
install hardwood floors or operate a 
switchboard 

Then, one ad in particular stands 
out, The bold black letters read 
"COLLEGE Students SUMMER 
WORK $10 25 starting entry level, 
immediate" 

OH THIS IS IT! HERE IS MY 
JOB! College student summer ... 
S10.25 ... Yes. that is definitely me. 



Wait one minute, though. What 
kind of job starts immediately at 
$10.25? Visions of manual labor 
and sweat appear before my eyes 
Ooh yuck. That is definitely not 
me 

Hmm there is an ad from 
Avon. Sales people can earn 5200- 
$2000 a month. Walking door lo 
door does not sound all that bad 
Avon has its merits. Who knows 
what eule boy may he behind door 
number three? The walking will 
whip me into shape, but do I really 
want to be known by my friends as 



the "Avon Lady'' for the rest of my 
life'' Better keep looking 

"Exotic Dancers Needed." No. 
no, no. The money may be good, 
bul I am not that desperate. No 
amount of money could make me 
go through thai self-degradation. I 
think. 

Maybe I should review my 
assets I have two years of college, 
computer experience ... plasma. 

That's it. I can sell plasma all 
summer. 1 meet all of the qualifica- 
tions. I weigh over 110 pounds 
ljust over), I'm in good health and 



have had no body piercing or tat- 
toos wilbm the past 12 months All 
right, 1 can donate about twice a 
week for then next 14 weeks. At 
$20 per donation, that makes $480. 
Sigh Back to the want ads. 

I could broaden my job opportu- 
nities and work out-of-state. There 
are always jobs in Alaska. This ad 
reads "Fishing Industry, parks, 
resoris. Earn $3,000- 

$6,000+/month!" I wonder how 
long it would take to remove the 
fish stench from my clothing 

Here is an ad for a cruise job I 



could cam up lo $2000 a month. 
Sailing on the high seas, lots of 
sun, lounge chairs.. .it all makes a 
very nice picture This is the real 

world though, not the "Love Boat." 
Can you say "grunt work 7 " 

After a fruitless day of search- 
ing, I decide that although I could 
make bundles of money dancing in 
a bar or working in 24 hours of 
daylight in Alaska, neither is the 
right job for me. I guess that this is 
the lime lo march on over lo the 
nearest temporary agency and hope 
for the best. 



Braveheart' a video must 



by Jeremy Ecenbarger 
Staff Writer 

As the 68lb annual Academy 
Awards, one bonoree stood out 
among the rest, one film, possibly 
one man. The 1995 Best Picture 
Academy Award was awarded to 
"Braveheart," (surprisingly the only 
R-raied movie nominated) while its 
leading man, actor Mel Gibson, 
received Best Director. 

This Ihree-hour epic adventure is 
a terrific film about a man named 
William Wallace (Gibson) who 
risks everything in bis life to claim 
freedom for bis homeland of 
Scotland. The King of England 
reigns over the land as an evil, con- 
niving dictator who mistreats the 
people of his surrounding villages. 

Among his many disturbing 
laws, one slates that any newly-wed 
woman must sleep with him on her 
wedding night: she will then be 
returned to her husband the pro- 
ceeding day If the law were noi 
obeyed, the man would be killed 



and the woman raped and beaten. 
The villagers are terrified, yet 
nobody dares lo defy the king. 

The desperate villagers longed 
for a leader to liberate them. 
Wallace was the man that would 
make it happen. In the beginning, 
Wallace withdraws from violence 
as a result of having witnessed his 
father's murder as a child He 
refuses to be a pan of any fighting. 
He is a simple villager who longs 
for a normal life with a wife and 
children 

When his wife, whom he secret- 
ly married in order lo defy the 
king's law. is suddenly attacked 
and murdered, he longs desperately 
to gain revenge and freedom for his 
people 

In a drastic turnaround, he 
becomes a legendary warrior of 
immeasurable heights who will not 
stop until freedom is won. 

"Braveheart" is a movie that 
contains explicit violence The 



entire movie is filled with magnifi- 
cently filmed fighting scenes. 
However, Gibson's portrayal is 
unbelievable as a character who 
went from a kind, loving man to a 
freedom-fighting beast. His shouls 
of anguish and revenge stand out 
among those belonging to the thou- 
sands of others who take part in 
battle. 

The film is of universal texture. 
Ii contains romance, comedy, 
action and history Filled wiih 
many unexpected events, il is full 
of betrayal and sadness. The 
amount of suspense it entails is 
unbelievable Splendid music, cos- 
tumes and scenery welcome the 
viewer lo enchanted Scotland 
where the many intriguing scenes 
occur With all the pails brought 
together. "Braveheart" is an 
astounding film that audiences will 
enjoy. 

It can currently be found on 
video.

New EP takes listener for emotional ride 



by Amanda Manion 
Features Editor 
"Listeners to 
the new EP by 
Elysian Field, 
released on 
Radioactive 
Records. find 
themselves 
seduced and 

bewitched by lead 
vocalist Jennifer 
Charles's voice. The 
four tracks on [he EP 
are a wonderfully 
hypnotic audio jour- 
ney into a shadowy, mysterious and emo- 




tional world. 

"For me. music is like emotion 
It's not an easy place It's a place 
with black holes." Charles says. 
Charles was bom in Washington 
DC Her mother was a torch singer, 
her father a jazz DJ At age 14, 
Charles began an acting career 
Eventually, she moved to New 
York's Lower East Side, working 
in off-off Broadway theaters, 
singing in downtown clubs, 
curating a poetry series at the 
Knitting factory and appeared 
live with no-wave punk bands 
From that experience, Charles became part 
of Elysian Fields a little over a year ago. 



The four EP tracks arc slighUy reminis- 
cent of the Cowboy Junkies due to James 
Genus's heavy bass line and Owen 
Bloedow's acoustic guitar Ed Pastonni on 
piano, guitar and vocals and drummer Ben

and Pastonni co-produced the EP with 
executive producer Gary Kurfisl "Studio 
wizards" Bryce Goggm (Pavement. 
Spacehog, Breeders) and Mario Salvati

Elysian Fields' music brings to mind 
images of candlelit rooms on cold winter 
nights and feelings of blissful numbness Be

girl, her mother and her grandmoth- 
er Despite the risks after so many 
years of alienation, the three women 
must summon the courage to 
try to build a 
life together

Beering passes buck 

Ryan's future 

still 

in limbo 



A ruling concerning (he Jack 
Ryan case has finally been issued. 
Ryan, a pan-lime instructor, was not 
rehired after his contract expired in 
May 1995 He lefl the university 
amidst claims 
of racist 

remarks to a 
student. 

In April 
1996, Ryan 
filed a griev- 
ance with 
IPFW to 

restore him to 
his position 
The committee 
which heard 
Ryan's griev- 
ance ruled that 
IPFW did not 
follow proper 
procedure in 
dealing with 



required the University to reappoint 
Mr Ryan as an associate faculty 
member " Beering seems unable to 
do anything wiib the Ryan case, and 
be was supposed to be the final 
word, He bas thrown back the deci- 
sion of whether or not to rehire Jack 
Ryan to IPFW and bas become just 
another timid administrator with lit- 
tle or no decision-making ability 

Beering also said in his letter that 
be is denying Ryan's grievance. But

Commentary 



decided not to render a concrete rul- 
ing by ignoring the findings of the 
grievance committee He has failed 
to do bis job in this matter and bas 
passed tbc proverbial buck back to 
IPFW. To paraphrase Harry Truman 
and a cartoon in Classroom 
Medical, "The Buck picks up speed 
at Purdue." Is there some sort of 
drug given to administrators which 
removes their decision-making abil- 
ity? Or is indecision just part of a 
university administrator' s job? 

In bis letter to the grievance 
committee Beering wrote, "I am 
unable to agree with any of the 
panel's findings that suggest any- 
thing IPFW did or did not do 



Wbat happens to us when those 
with more experience do not make 
the decisions they are responsible 
for making? 

In the great chain of being, the 
people above us have the duty to 
perform as leaders. Part of being a 
leader of a company. CEO of a 
multinational corporation, President 
of the United States or even presi- 
dent of a midwestem university is 
making thoughtful decisions for the 
greater good. When a leader or pres- 
ident lacks these vital skills he bas a 
responsibility to the people to step 
aside and allow someone with the 
confidence to make a decision take 
over.

Book Review: Baseball authors 
throw a perfect game 




by Jim Porter 
Sports Editor 

With ihe baseball season in full 
swing and tbe hometown team 
. struggling to win, maybe it's time 
to cuddle up with a book and wail 
out the losing streak? In an effort to 
better accommodate readers, I have 
taken the liberty of reviewing a few 
of the better recently released books 
about America's pastime. 

i. Casey Stencle: A Splendid 
Life by Richard Bak 

Here is a rich collection of pic- 
tures and pontifical] on s. regarding 
the "Ole Professor." The book con- 
tains a complete dictionary of terms 
in "Stenglcse." A must for true 
baseball enlhusiaists. 

*. High Amd Tight by Bob 
Klapisch 

Here is possibly tbe most appro- 
priately bded book ever to be pub- 
lished. It chronicles the sorry 
decline and latest efforts of Dwighl 
Gooden and Darryl Strawberry. A 
no-holds-barred look into the trials 



and tribulations of these former 
stars. 

j. It's Where You Play: How 
Youth Baseball Determines 
the Personality of the 
American Male by Mdce Ryan 
and Luke Ryan 

This father and son team gives a 
tongue-in-cheek look at how a 
boy's life is forever cast according 
to what position he played in Little 
League. Tbe book gives a posiuon- 
by-position study of the character 
trails and likely future occupations. 
Examples include the fact that 
catchers make great FBI agents and 
3rd basemen often become truck 
drivers. 

*. The Homerun Encyclopedia 
edited by bob mcconnell and 
Da vu&gt; Vincent 

Here is an exhaustive research 
done by the Society for American 
Baseball Research which chronicles 
the who, what and where of every 
homerun hit in the major leagues 
since 1876. Every detail of each 
round tripper is captured. Want to 
know who served up Ted Williams' 
500lh dinger? Read the book! 

jr. Wricleyville: A Magical 
History by Peter Golenbock 

Despite more than 50 years of 
futile play, the Chicago Cubs con- 
tinue to be one of America's most 
popular teams. Golenbock blends 
fine reportage and interviews to 
chronicle the Cubbies star-crossed 
history. A must for every desperate 
Cubs fan looking for proof that tbe 



team has not always been a literal 

doormat of the National League. 

*, Jack Brickhouse: A Voice 
for all Seasons by Janice A 
Petterchak 

Another book that delves into 
tbe history of baseball in the Windy 
City Pelerchak writes of the life 
and times of tbe Hail of Fame 
announcer said to be "the man who 
has been forced to watch more bad 
baseball than anyone else this cen- 
tury." 

7. The Joys of Keeping Score: 
All About Boxscores, Official 
Scorers and the Fine Art of 
Tending a Scorecard by Paul 
Dickson 



% Lnside Pitch: A Close Look 
at Classic Baseball Moments 
by john Skipper 

A wonderfully insightful look at 
the moments in history that have 
made the game a part of American 
life Tbe events chronicled include 
many of the Firsts and one-of-a-kind 
events that make the game special. 
There is a full description of the 
first inside-the-park pinch-hit 
bomerun. an account of the first 
midget to appear in the majors and 
the first designated hitler to bat in 
the American League. 

to. The Illustrated History of 
Mickey Mantle by Gene 
Schoor

A celebration of one of sports The author spent countless hours 
most divine and unique pleasures; with Mantle to gather a personal 
the art of painting a picture of an account of "The Mick." The book's 
entire game with a #2 pencil and a 200 photos are a true highlight. A 
blank lineup card. A must have for must for every true baseball fan. 
any father intent on leaching his son 
(and or daughters) the time honored 
tradition of keeping score. 

K Crossing the Line: Black 
Major Leaguers, 1947-'59 by 
Larry Moffi and Jonathan 
Khonstadt 



Even after Jackie Robinson 

broke the so-called color barrier, 
those who followed in his footsteps 
were victims of racial taunts and the 
cruelty of society. Still, they went 
on to star in the "big leagues". The 
book contains biographical sketches 
of such all-stars as Roberto 
Clemente. Roy Campanella and 
Hank Aaron.

Luyendyk speeds to "500" 

Arie Luyendyk, the only 
former winner entered in this year's 
Indianapolis 500, shattered the 
track speed records on Sunday. 

A four-lap average speed 
of 236.986 miles per hour topped 
the record set by pole position win- 
ner Scott Brayton. Luyendyk 
recorded a fast lap of 237.498 mph 
during the record- setting run. He 
will start the 80th running of Ihe 
historic race from the inside of the 
seventh row in 21st position. 

Race rules allow qualifica- 
tion for the pole position to take 
place only during the first day of 
qualifying. This is the 17lh time 
that the fastest qualifier has been 
ineligible for die pole position. Tbe 
most recent occurrence was in 1991 
when Rick Mecrs won the pole, but 
Gary Beltenhausen's second day 
qualifying speed was the fasiest in 
the field. 



Chargers running back pre- 
sumed dead... 

Tragedy has struck once 
again for the San Diego Chargers. 
After dealing with die death of line- 
backer David Griggs last season, 
the team now faces the apparent 
death of running-back Rodney 
Culver. 

Culver and his wife, 
Karen, were listed on the passenger 
manifest of ValuJct Airlines flight 
592 that crashed in the Florida 
Everglades Saturday. Neither of die 
Culver's two daughters, aged two 
years and 15 months, were listed as 
passengers on the plane. 

Federal air safety experts 
and emergency workers have 
expressed doubt at the possibility of 
survivors. The plane, which took 
off from Miami and was headed lor 
Atlanta, carried 104 passengers and 
five crew members, 

Culver, who played col- 
lege football at Notre Dame, was 



viewed as the running back of the 
future for the Chargers after the 
team released Natron Means last 
season. 



Marlin fishes out a no-no... 

Florida left-hander Al 
Leiter pulled off a pair of firsts 
Sunday as he threw the season's 
first no-hitter. It was also die first 
no-hitter thrown by a Marlin' s 
pitcher in die team's brief history. 
Leiter, known for his ten- 
dency to be a bit wdd on the 
mound, struck out six, walked two 
and hit one batter. He threw 103 
pitches, 60 for strikes. 

It was the first no- hitler in 
the majors since Ramon Martinez 
held the Marlins without a hit last 
July 14. Leiter is the first southpaw 
to throw a no-no since Kenny 
Rogers of Texas pitched a perfect 
game against California on July 20, 
1994. 



Sixers dump Lucas and staff... 

Another NBA team began 
cleaning house Monday. The 
Philadelphia 76crs announced Head 
Coach John Lucas will not return to 
the bench next season. Also fired 
were assistant coaches Tom 
Tbibodeau and Ron Adams. The 
team did keep former player 
Maurice Checks. 

Only the expansion 
Vancouver Grizzlies had a worse 
record (15-67) than the Sixers (18- 
64) last season. 

Lucas becomes the sixth 
coach to lose his job since the end 
of the regular season Allan 
Bristow (Charlotte), Dick Motta 
(Dallas). Dutch Beard (New 
Jersey), Brendan Malone (Toronto) 
and Mike Dunleavy (Milwaukee) 
are die others.
