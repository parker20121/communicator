Ily Den Solero 
Managing Editor 

Student Academic Counseling Ser- 
vices and Career Services co-sponsor 
"A Major Investigation," an annua! 
event aimed at helping undecided stu- 
dents declare an academic major. It 
will be held Monday, Feb. 22, from 
11:45 to 1:00 in the Walb Memorial 
Union Ballroom. 

According to Lauri Herbrand, 
SACS coordinator for the event, this 
year's program will include: 



-Over 30 IPFW depanment displays 
-Advisors from each department to 
answer questions 
-Informotion on each department

tions. Discover is a software program 



that lists details of hundreds of 
careers. 

"The event Is informative to all sm-

International students participate 
actively in various organizations 



By Anita Slelnbacher 
Guest Writer 

The presence of intemaiional stu- 
dents on the IPFW campus is a rela- 
tively new phenomenon. Students 
from 59 countries, in addition to 
Puerto Rico and the Phillipine Is- 
lands are cuneniJy enrolled accord- 
ing to Betty Folks, Assisuint Regis- 
trar. There are 126 international sm- 
dents, with Fl visas (students who 
study in American universities, 
sponsored by their home govern- 
ments, or by other foreign agencies), 
and J I visas (usually privately spon- 
sored by their parents), enrolled. 

This minority comprises roughly 1 
percent of the total 12,090 students 
enrolled for the Fall 1992 semester. 
There arc also 165 other students, 
includhig political refugees, and per- 
manent residents with HI, H4 and 
LI visas. In all, there are approxi- 
mately 290 students with roughly 
the same problems, according to Dr. 
Phillip A. Kcnncll, Director of Inter- 
national Siudent Services. 

According to Kenncll, IPFW's first 
exposure to international students 
occuned in the Fall of 1985 with the 
presence of twelve Malaysian stu- 
dents on campus. The students were 
excellent. They did well on campus, 
and the faculty enjoyed them, Some 
of them wore their traditional appar- 
el on campus, and they stood out. 
Their success enabled IPFW to open 
up the Office of Internationa Stu- 
dents (OIS) in February, 1987. 
There were not many international 
students, though. They were not ac- 
tively recruited. "Any we did have, 
were due to an unusual situation," 
said Kennell. 
IPFW has had international stu- 



dents on campus officially since 
1987, Prior to that, Lafayette was 
not interested in having Lniemational 
students attend the Fori Wayne cam- 
pus, according to Kcrmell, Three out 
of the four disciplines most popular 
with iniematiorml students were Pur- 
due disciplines. Indiana University 
was always good about allowing in- 
ternational students on the IPFW 
campus, with its business degree 
program, but engineering, computer 
science, and computer information 
systems are Purdue disciplines. 

Single handedly, Kennell has 
helped to make this program the 
success it is, and it continues to 
grow. He believes that in this global 
society, the American students need 
to expand their horizons beyond 
Fon Wayne, Indiana. The American 
campus would be incomplete with- 
out exposure to multi-cultural facili- 
ties and International students. What 
belter way than to have international 
students sitting beside American sm- 
dents in their classrooms? 

A major breakthrough for OIS was 
made in Fall 1992. For the first time 
in IPFW's history, it look over the 
immigration and admission process 
from the main campus at Lafayette, 
and is now self-sufficient. 

"We do everything here ourselves. 
We can accept people In a much 
quicker way, within one or two 
weeks, versus eight to ten weeks," 
said Kenncll. 

International students play a very 
active roll on campus. The President 
of the Student Body, Rajai Sun, is 
from India. Two out of the three 
vice-presidents of the siudent body 
are international students. Three 
senators are international students. 
Pulin Sampat, from India, is head of 



the Honors Club. 

According to Surl, "International 
students are an Important asset to 
any campus." American students are 
encouraged to participate in the In- 
ternational Student Organization, 
and some do. "We are inicmational 
students in a truly global sense, not 
just intemaiional students, except for 
the United States," said Suri. 

The requirements for admission 
into IPFW for an intemaiional stu- 
dent are very stringent, Since IPFW, 
like most American colleges, picks 
only the best students, what Ameri- 
cans see on this campus are the 
aeam of the aop: hard working, in- 
telligent students, most likely to 
succeed. 

In the last six years, IPFW has had 
favorable exposure to international 
students, and a glimpse into the best 
of other cultures. 

Overall, Kennell says, "We have 
been really pleased with the percent- 
age of international students that 
have succeeded and done very well 
here. We have been very pleased 
with their acclimatization to the 
community, and adjustment to the 
university," 

Students exposed to other cultures, 
tend to be more liberal in their 
thinking, and more receptive to oth- 
ers different from them. 

Kennell said, "I think that any 
problems we might sec out there, are 
more than off-set by the advantages 
gained by having international stu- 
dents on campus." He continues. "I 
personally would like to see that we 
have 5 percent of our student popu- 
lation comprised of truly interna- 
tional students wlthFl.orJI visas." 

Part two next week. 



IPFW campus evolves from separate facilities 



By Laura LIneback 
Chief Reporter 

IPFW fiscal arrangements, academ- 
ic responsibilities, and campus 
growth were Included in "The IPFW 
Education: Then and Now" Feb. 3. 
discussion of the School of Education 
Colloquium Scries, Kenneth L. 
Keller, associate professor of educa- 
tion and academic advisor of siu- 
denis. presented a brief history of the 
beginnings and the expansion of Indi- 
ana University-Purdue University 
Fon Wa&gt;Tic. 

Keller, a faculty member since 
1966. retires from IPFW the end of 
FcbTMary, Because he was one of the 
first faculty members to witness the 
development of IPF\V, he was asked 
by John Groic, assistant professor of 
education, to give a brief history of 
the Fon Wayne joint campus for the 
bcncHi of the new faculty and stu- 
dents. 



Edwin C. Leonard, Jr., associate 
professor of business administration 
and chair of management/marketing, 
introduced the guest speaker, Keller, 
his colleague of 26 years. 

"Originally, the Indiana and Purdue 
universities at Fort Wayne were two 
separate campuses," began Keller. In- 
diarm University Fon Wayne opened 
its doors in 1917 on South Barr Street 
and moved to the present 566 acre 
site in 1964, Around 1947. Purdue 
University staned on the comer of 
Columbia and Calhoun streets to pro- 
vide technical training, primarily to 
support returning G.I.'s who needed 
jobs. 

Keller talked about the scparateness 
of the two universities when they 
Joined to share the same facilities in 
1964, -T^iey said, 'There are things 
we've got to divide up.' So, the phys- 
ical plant, custodial services, the 
bookstore operation, and the food 
services operation *-ere designated to 



Purdue. The library and audio-visual 
services went to Indiana University," 
he said. 

For about two years, the two univer- 
sities rotated room scheduling: Indi- 
ana would claim choice classrooms 
and class schedules for its students 
one year, Purdue would have the right 
to do so for its students the year after. 

The early years of IPFW had its ten- 
sions. "There was a little chaos once 
in a while. Things weren't too friend- 
ly: it was them and us," said Keller. 
One year, uniformed guards were 
hired to monitor a television showing 
of an Indiana vs. Purdue game, noted 
Keller. 

In the early years, undergraduate 
programs were directed by either Pur- 
due or Indiana, according to the num- 
ber of full-time faculty hired by the 
respective universities. For example, 
because Purdue had no faculty mem- 
bers In undergraduate business, the 
school was placed under I.U, Keller 



said that in order for some faculty to 
stay at Fort Wayne campus they 
would have to "move over to the oth- 
er side of the house." and change em- 
ployers (I.U, or Purdue), Some 
schools, such as Education, were 
divided between the two universi- 
ties due to the large number of 
instructon. 

Until 1977, both Purdue and I.U. 
had separate education certification 
programs. Keller, who had been the 
cenification officer for Purdue for 
25 years, took over all certification 
responsibilities. 

IPFW's fiscal management is now a 
touchy subject, noted Keller. In July, 
1977 a document was signed, in 
which not only were degree programs 
placed under I.U. or Purdue, but also, 
all the financial control was given to 
Purdue. 

"Purdue lost academically, and 
everybody said 'that's too bad,' but 
they sure did win in a thing called 



money!" said Keller. 

IPFW employed two admissions of- 
ficers and two registrars until 1973. 
Prior to that lime students were re- 
quired to be admitted twice and pay 
fees twice. Sometimes fees were 
different. 

In 1974, the first joint programs bul- 
letin was produced, though it was still 
divided into two pans. According to 
Keller, "In those days, when you 
taught a class, you got two print-outs 
of students. One print-out said 'here 
are your Uidiana students.' the other 
said 'here are your Purdue students.'" 

For a while, grading caused some 
confusion since I.U. allows for pluses 
and minuses on letter grades. Purdue 
docs not. "Today this is the only Indi- 
ana University campus which uses 
the Purdue grading scale," Keller 
noted. 

Keller and other long-time faculty 
reminisced about student activism in 
the 60's. When ihe campus initiated 



paid parking, siudcnis, who were en- 
couraged by the faculty, protested. 

Before IPFW, the St. Joseph nver 
area was the site of the Indiana State 
School farm and cemetery. Since not 
many Fon Wayne residents were fa- 
miliar with the regional campus, 
IPFW was affectionately called "By- 
Pass High" until new buildings joined 
Keiller Hall to expand the university. 

Keller concluded his presentaiion 
with the history of the campus physi- 
cal expansion, from Neff Hall to the 
Fine Aru Building. 

Other faculty members commented 
on IPFW's development for nearly 
three decades. Though IPFW has im- 
proved its structure and facilities con- 
siderably, Leonard noted that student 
activism and involvement is noi as 
great as what it could be, 

Dr. Raymond Graves, formerly of 
Saint Francis College, will replace 
Keller as the School of Education 
ceniflcaUon offlco'.

I PFW athletics 
deserve support 



IPFW athletic teams have 
earned respect from many col- 
leges throughout the slate and the 
country. They have received na- 
tional status through ranldngs and 
magazines. 

Yet, with the national media 
hype and honors, (he teams arc 
having a hard time earning the re- 
spect of its home crowd, namely 
ihe IPFW student 
body. 

Students are looking 
ai the (earns as third 
rnlc mail that should 
be just tossed out, 
and not as the first rate 
establishment ihey 
have worked hard to 
become. 

Students at PFW are 
caught in the idea that 
commuter colleges are 
a place where they go 
to school and then go 
home 10 their regular 
life, not as a place that 
can become an exten- 
sion of ihcir regular 
life. 

Often limes students 
remark that a com- 
muter college cannot 
have an atmosphere 
like that of a !^real" 
college. Students are 
afraid to become aware 
of the college scene 
fearing that Ihcy may 
actually And that life is 
not thai bad al a com- 
muter college. 

Athletic events have been a 
symbol of the strength of a col- 
lege for decades, At IPFW it is no 
different. Strong teams suggest 
that a college is blooming with 
spirit and vigor. 

These attributes must be dis- 
played through the student body. 
Unfonunaiely at IPFW these ai- 
iribuies stop at the athletes and 
never make it to the student body. 

The siudem body has fixed itself 
as a separate entity afraid lo be- 
come involved in the simple en- 



joyment of watching or cheering 
for an IPFW adileiic learn. 

Attending the events is not an 
obligation. It is a privilege. A 
privilege that cost nothing lo the 
student body. 

Ii cost the aihletes. They work 
hard and long hours to offer 
IPFW good athletic teams to en- 
joy. The studcnl body, however, 
has not even given the 
teams a chance. 

IPFW is lacking the 
support and enthusiasm 
that a college needs to 
be successful. When 
support for a university 
is obtained, that col- 
lege is on ils way to be- 
ing the fulfilling func- 
tion it is meant to be in 
society. 

The IPFW student 
body needs to begin 
showing support and 
enthusiam for ils ath- 
letic teams. It is time 
for students to make a 
stand and show pride 
in their place of 
education. 

Ii won't happen over 
nighl. The first step is 
to make students 
aware of iheircollege 
environment 

The second step is for 
organizations to orga- 
nize booster clubs and 
cheering squads to 
cheer for the leams on 
ihc coun and ofT. 

Maybe IPFW could even orga- 
nize a small band to attend the 
games and add that "real" college 
atmosphere, IPFW does have a 
music dcparimeni, that could 
show their talents by allending 
and performing at IPFW athletic 
games. 

If IPFW ever has a chance at be- 
coming a "real" college (with 

dorms and all), it is going to be 
through the support of its student 
body.

"Just a Theory 

'Silly Love 

When researching a certain subject, 
one of the fini places I look is my tape 
and CD collection. It is there ihai I find 
imaiierings of profound knowledge, 
cleverly hidden behind lots of "na- 

as,""hey-heys," and "doo-doos," 

On the subject of love, here is an in- 
fmiicsimal sample of what my music 
collection has to say; 

James Taylor tells me that "there 

In't no doubt in no one's mind that 
love's the finest thing around," Bruce 
Springsteen counters with 'They say 
in the Old true love prevails, but in the 
me love can't be some fairy tale." 
And the J. Gicls Band eloquently 
points out that "Love slinks, yeah 
yeah, love slinks...! mean it slinks." 

Most people, at one ume or another 
in their life, have probably felt each of 
these feelings. But however you see ii, 
you can't deny the stronghold that love 
has over our society. 

And I'm not even talking aboui all 
the different kinds of love; brodierly 
love, love of Ood, love of Art, love of 
ice acam, etc, 

I'm talking about romantic love. The 
kind of love thai makes otherwise ra- 
tional people do the silliest things, 
such as write inane love poems using 
toaster metaphors or spend thousands 
of dollars on a piece of chipped rock. 
The kind of love that, once it goes 
away, leaves its victims saying things 
like, "I can't believe 1 said we were 
like the hot colls of passion luming our 
bread of love Into toast. What was I 
thinking?" 

~ut love isn't about thinking. It's 
about fresh breath, wavy hair, musky 
scents, blue eyelids, pinkish powdered 
rubbery- looking cheeks, slick figures 
with surgery-enhanced cleavage, and 
tall, dark, handsome egos. This image 
of love Is brought to you by the gazll- 
lions of movies, magazines, and com- 
mercials that sell pre-packaged ready- 
for-your-enjoymeni love for only a 
scant $19.95. (All major credit cards 
accepted.) 

Or perhaps you don't buy the superfi- 
cial image of love. Perhaps you see it 
dinner, tnielligeni and witty conver- 
sation, moonlit strolls along the beach 
(In Fon Wayne, Indiana?) and riding 
off into the sunset while The Eagles' 

Peaceful Easy Feeling" plays in the 



" by Tim Schreiber 

Songs' fill the world 



background. Love is a bucket of bliss 
that will solve all of your problems. 

Unfonunaiely, love isn't like thai. It 
can't be bought, and it won't solve all 
of your problems. About the only 
problem it will solve is the problem of 
what to do on a Friday nighL Instead 
of having noihing to do, you can argue 
with your significant odicr about what 
to do. 

In fact, there's a good possibility that 
love will just create more problems. 
For CKamplc. when you're single, how 
often do you argue about whose turn it 
is to do the dishes? (Thai's rhciorical 
question. If you argue with yourself on 
any issue. I recommend a long vaca- 
tion,). What chances do you havcjjL 
your significant other dumping you for 
a drummer in a reggae band if you 
don't even have a significant other? 
And when single, you can crank up 
your accordion music (or whatever 
twisted musical interest you have) as 
loud as you want, and you don't have 
to worry about whether he/she is into 
it. Also, you don't have to deal with 
trying lo impress an entirely new fami- 
ly that is just as annoying as the one 
you came from. So you can see the 
sense of independence and security 
that comes with singledom. 

And all love can offer you Is com- 
panionship, affection, self-confidence, 
and a contented feeling of oneness 
with the universe, 

So why would anyone choose to fall 
in love? 

There's some heavy love propaganda 
going on in our media. The victims of 
this love propaganda naively believe 
that "love is all you need" (Beatles, 
1967) and thai '"til somebody loves 
you. ..your life Is just 'a waste of time" 
(Henry Lee Summer, 1991) and that 
"tnie love conquen all" (Neil Young, 
1992.) I'm not just quoting these songs 
to till up space. I'm trying to prove a 
poinL (If I wanted to fill up space with 
tove lyrics, I could write an entire se- 
mester's worth of columns using 
Beatles songs alone.) 

Romantic love (and all forms there- 
of; including, but not limited lo; crush- 
es, infatuation, rciadonships. marriage, 
sex, and insipid pet nicknames) is the 
most talked about, written aboui, and 
sung about subject in the world. 



It's no wonder thai the victims of the 
love propagandists naturally believe 
thai it must be some sort of super emo- 
tion; some bucket of bliss that will not 
only solve ell of life's problems but 
will also get rid of those nasty warts, 

But I think wc need to take off our 
hcait-shapcd goggles and sec love for 
what it really Is: A wacky emotion 
and/or intoxicant given to us by a God 
with a zany sense of humor. 

How else would you explain the eu- 
phoric stupor that inspires people in 
love to sigh blissfully, stare with a 
glazed look off into another world and 
say, "My. doesn't the wall look cspe: 
dally beautiful lodayl And this doot- 
-knob, whatalovelydoorknob.;."- — 

TTiis wouldn't be so bad If wc all fell 
like this all the time. But we don't. 
And nothing Is mote irrliating to 
someone trying to have a good sulk 
than someone else droning on about 
the beauty of the world. 

Just like driving, voting, and buying 
liquor, the euphoric stupor of love 
goes away. That stupor is replaced 
widi responsibility and, gel this, actual 
work. This is called a "relationship." 
And after doing all this [shudder) 
work, all you get in return is security 
and tame conienunent. The vicums of 
the love propaganda then lament, 
"Hey, this never happened in the 
'Certs' commercial!" 

And let's not forget about the people 
for whom Jackson Browne is singing 
when he says, "love won't come near 
me, she don't even hear me, she walks 
by my vacancy sign,.." 

After all of the excitement and sugai 
comas of Valentine's Day have sub- 
sided, I think wc need to sober up and 
ponder these things. I suggest we ob- 
serve a brief moment of silence for 
those unfortunate souls who woke up 
February 15ih to realize ihai ihcy had, 
in the heat of a moment, actually 
called another human being "sugar- 
lips," or had blown a wad of cash on a 
"Precious Moments" figurine. 

Perh^s Bob Dylan said it best when 
he wailed, "I don't know why I love 
her but I just can't stop,. .I'm in love 
with the ugliest girl in the world." 
Makes you fee! warm all over, 
doesn't it?

To the Editor: 

Oliver North is o snake. He has com- 
mitted many crimes against the tax 
payers of the United Slates. His deeds 
were unscrupulous and because of his 
political/war crimes, many Central 
American citizens were murdered and 
arc still being murdered. 

Poor Siephan Kclley did not under- 
stand Jeff's [Brunson) editorial. The 
main point is really simple. If Opera- 
tion Rescue is concerned with the pos- 
sibility of life before birdi, why would 
they support an administration that 
murders so many people after birth? 
Wouldn't someone who Is "pro-llfo" 
be opposed to war? I believe I've hit 
the main point. Obviously Siephan 
Kelley didnot. 

Finally, Jeff Is an avid researcher of 
political views and has amassed a 
great knowledge on the subject of the 
contfas, Oliver North, etc. You do noi 
have to be a journalist to research and 
be an Infonned citizen. Siephan Kel- 
ley, your political beliefs are based on 
emotion. Jeff's are based on rational 
fact.

U.S. politicians subsidize state terrorism 



By Jefrnrunson 
Guest Writer 

Gu^iicmalan human rights leader 
Rigobcru Mcnchu's winning of the 
Nobel Peace Pri7c lasi autumn could 
have served as a springboaid for edu- 
cating the U.S. public about 
Ouaiemaia's terrorisi state, and the 
U.S. government's support for the 
fascist who control thai country, but 
no emended national discussion 
transpired. 

A Washington Post article on 
Mcnchu's Nobel honor, reprinted on 
ihc front page of the Joumal-Cazciic 
(10/17/92) displays some common 
ways in which establishment media 
marginalize such discussions, by nul- 
lifying the domestic political impact 
of events which spotlight U.S. for- 
eign policy crimes. 

The article acknowledged that 
"GuatcmaJa has one of the most criti- 
cized human rights records in the 
hemisphere," and that its abuses are 
"widely documented." Ii listed atroci- 
ty siaiisiics. made reference to the 
deaths of Mcnchu's father and broth- 
er (burned alive by the Guatemalan 
army) and the lonure murder of her 
mother by Guatemalan security 
forces, but it did not mention that the 
U.S. government created Guatemala's 
terrorist state and periodically sup- 
plies it with money, military aid and 
personnel training. The article's lack 
of historical contort ensured iliat un- 
informed readers would remain clue- 
less 10 the political, economic and 
racial factors contributing lo the con- 
ditions it described. 

During the Spanish colonial era. 
huge land grams were bestowed upon 
a small number of well-connected 
European families, establishing the 
system of immense wc^ih for a few, 
and grinding poverty for majorities 
which has historically prevailed in 
many Latin American countries. 
Many of these countries also retained 
large native American populations 
which were shoved into the ranks of 
the have-nois. 

Such is the case on both counts m 
Guatemala, where the Mayan Indian 
majority is virtually held captive by 
the wealthy European minority. For 
most of this century. Guatemala's oli- 
garchy and collaborating multination- 
al corporations have profited immea- 
surably from the land's natural re- 
sources and starvation- wage native 
labor. This set-up was temporarily 
threatened in the 1940s and 1950s. 
however, a ten-year period of demo- 



cratically-elected government fos- 
tered a climate of independent jour- 
nalism, uncensored public discourse, 
and unhindered organisation of peas- 
ants, labor unions and political 
parties. 

This era ended in 1954 after 
Guatemalan President Jacobo Arbcnz 
tried to alleviate rural poverty 
through land reform. He was ousted 
by U.S. -trained mercenaries in de- 
fense of United Fruit Company land 
holdings, the unchecked power and 
stolen wealth of other multi-nation- 
als, and the political, economic and 
racial supremacy of their landed-gen- 
try hosts. An authoritarian govern- 
ment was subsequently installed. 

Since then, the dynamics of fascist 
control over an unconseniing majori- 
ty have demanded high body counLS. 
In 1966, a U.S.-assisted counter at- 
tack against 400 rebels resulted in the 
deaths of 10.000 peasants. In the 
wake of this episode, death squads 
were institutionalized and the perma- 
neni "disappearances" of Guaierrulan 
dissidents continued horn that point 
in time up to the present. In the 
1970s. U.S. police training of 
Guatemalan security forces further 
enhanced their lethal capacity in what 
amounts to a protracted ethnic cleans- 
ing campaign. 

During Ronald Reagan's presiden- 
cy. U.S. military and financial aid to 
Guatemala's rulers escalated, and 
govemmeni murders of civilians in- 
creased 10 holocaust proportions. Be- 
tween 1978 and i985. up to 100.000

and ai least 23 priests and mis-

A 1981 Amnesty Internationa! re- 
port on Guatemala noted, "The bod- 
ies of the victims have been found

sides or buried in mass graves. Thou-

Guatemala's goventmcni labels those 
who speak out against its human 
rights abuses as communist subver- 
sives and if they remain in the coun- 
try they risk execution or death by 
torture. Torture methods employed 
against human rights activists have 
included beatings, blow-torch roast- 
ing, rape and mutilation; their bodies 
have been found with eyes gouged 
out and tongues cut off. The state also 
punishes the families of those who 
refuse lo remtun silent. When a leader

left 100.000 people dead. 50.000 
"disappeared", 100,000 widowed, 
250,000 orphaned and one million 
displaced." 

To imply that the rebels share com- 
parable responsibility with 



Guatemala's terrorist state for the sta- 
tistics cited above is akin to implying 
that the Warsaw ghetto Jews who 
fought Nazi invaders share blame for 
the mass extermination of Poland's 
Jews. Nowhere in the article docs it 
mention the U.S. role in setting up 
the country's terrorisi state or its sup- 
plying and training of Guatemalan 
military forces and paramilitary death 
squads. 

The anicle's use of the term "Marx- 
ist" to describe Guatemala's rebels is 
worth noting because "fascist" and 
"racist" arc words which more truth- 
fully describe Guatemala's European- 
descent oligarchy, but such icrms arc 
never employed. This lop-sided de- 
scriptive set-up is simply a continua- 
tion of the Cold War propaganda 
framework which U.S. business me- 
dia have consistently applied since 
the 1950s. Any oppressed peasant in 
Central America who gets sick of 
watching his kids starve, or of seeing 
his family members and friends 
hauled away by the government lo be 
tortured and killed, automatically be- 
comes a "Marxist" or "Communist" 
in the U.S. media's eyes when he 
takes up arms against his U.S. -client

Mastodons can win it all 



By Michael Bass 
Sports Editor 

Maiiodon basketball is reaching a 
climacUc end. The icam has only si» 
games lefi before loumamcm limc. 

The Masiodons have a good 
chance lo take ihcmsclvcs lo ihc 
loumcy. 

With such an ending possible I feel 
its lime lo lei you know how far die 
IPFW team is going lo go m ihe near 
future. 

The Masiodons are hot. They arc 
16-4 on ihe season and 9-3 in the 
GLVC. They fall behind Kentucky 
Wcsleyan who are 10-3 and South- 
ern Indiana who currcniiy hold first 
al9.2. 

Both Southern Indiana and Ken- 
tucky Wcsleyan came into town rc- 
cenily and the Masiodons were able 
10 pull out two big Victories. 

However, ihc Mastodons have to 
look forward lo playing Kentucky 
Stale and Saint Joseph's. Both teams 
arc looking to knock IPFW out of 
ihe number 3 spot. 

The Kentucky State game will be 
played away, but Saint Joseph will 
have to win in town and Ihc 
Masiodons have never lost this sea- 
son at the Hilliard Gates Sports 
Center. 

All six of their upcoming games 



arc conference matches, only two of 
ihcm are at home. The Masiodons 
have their hands full if they are go- 
ing to make the loumey. 

One loss and they could be finish- 
ing iheir season up at the end of reg- 
ular season instead of the expanded 
y&gt;'ay of the toumamcni. 

1 believe that the Masiodons will 
most definitely win their ncm six 
games. They have the focus and the 
talent to do so. 

In terms of taJcni, first on ihc list 



The ball's 
in my court 



would be hard working senior Scan 
Gibson. Gibson leads the team in 
scoring and various other categories. 

Gibson's aggressive style and 
strength in ihc paint nuke him stand 
out, Gibson not only shows ihe lal- 
cm and ability to help his team make 
it to loumey, he also has the class 
and leadership style to help his (earn 
win the loumey. 

Senior Shane Gibson and junior 
Scott Simmons arc a vital key to the 
teams success. Boih arc great outside 
shooters and if they get hoi the team 
will follow right behind. 

Senior Andre Walton adds speed 
and versatility to ihe leam. Walton is 



able 10 go inside for the lay-up and 
can drain a three if needed. 

Walton also shows great control of 
the ball. He is able to grab a dozen 
assists on any given night. He also 
adds a lot of heart and maturity. 

As a team die Mastodons arc lack- 
ing nothing a gieai team needs to 
win. They have many bench players 
who can come in for any reason. 

If ihey need height and strength 
they have it in Senior Pat Murphy. 
senior John Hohnstrcitcr, and senior 
Doug Reincke. 

They have sophomore Russ 
Marcinek and junior Jeff Smithcy 
both are quick and ready to shoot 
from Ihe outside if need be, and ci- 
ther of them can give Walion some 
resting limc. 

Their bench is as deep as any 
coach could warn. Junior Tom Pat- 
terson and Freshman K.C. Runyan 
both proved themselves at IPFW's 
last win against Ashland. 

Coach Andy Piazza brings in 
strong coaching experience high- 
lighted by a college coaching record 
thai has never seen a losing season. 

Experience and maturity are the 
keys that can open the di^or imo (he 
final four for the Mastodons. Can 
they win it all? 

YES!

'Fab Four' play like seniors 



By Ben Sotera 
Managing Editor 

Last year, the Hackers fought their 
way 10 a third place finish in a lough 
pool, behind the Rebels, and evcniual 
intramural basketball champions. 
Jammin'. This year, die Hackers re- 
turn wiih a few eupcnenced players 
in combination with a quadruplet of 
freshman. 

Though the team's made of younger 
players than in his first two intramur- 
al seasons, veteran ballplayer and 
Hacker captain Ryan Jagger thinks 
his club will do well in pool B. 

"ll is a lough pool," said Ryan Jag- 



ger, "We hope to be in the top half of 
our pool, so we get a good tourna- 
ment draw." 

When toumamcni time comes, the 
team hopes to have honed its 
strengths and eliminated the weak- 
nesses. All of ihe team's members 
hail from Columbia Oty and grew up 
playing ball together, which is the 
principle asset ihe Hackers take lo ihe 
coun, according lo Ryan Jaeger. 

He also noicd the ability of the 
freshman on the leam, aptly dubbed 
"The Fab Four." 

"We may be freshman, bui wc play 
like seniors," slated freshman Hacker 
Jeff Jagger, 



Though the Hackers play to win 
while on the baskciball floor, ihc 
team's main objective during the 
coune of the iniramural season is to 
have fun, said Ryan Jagger. 

"I like the league. I took forward to 
it every year," Ryan Jagger slated. 
"Our leam is pretty crazy, wc just 
come out here lo have fun." 

Lane Smith, Jeff Klopfcnsicin. and 
Hank Nolan join Ryan Jagger on the 
Hackers' squad. Members of "The 
Fab Four" are Jeff Jagger. Rod 
Strack, Greg Schuman, and Joey 
Menchaea IV.

Scan Gibson who had II points on

Lady 'Dons capture win 



sports Editor 

Saturday Feb. 13 Ashland visited 
the Hill lard Gates Spoits Center. The 
Lady 'Dons greeted them with on 
csssy defeat beating Ashland 67-51. 

The game began with both teams 
showing ihe makes of a good game, 
but wiiti 10 minutes 52 seconds left in 
the half fPFW took the lead for good 
on iwo free throws by freshman 
Lindy Jones. 

At Ihc end of the half the Lady 
'Dons had buili a nine poini lead and 
slowly built on thai throughout the 
second half. 

The Lady 'Don defense was solid 
h)»'hlighlcd by a 10 minute period in 
the second half in which Ashland on- 
ly scored 6 points. 

'The girls ore getting belter. They 
are a lot more aggressive and commu- 
nicate better," said Coach Eileen 
KIcinfeltcr. 

The more aggressive nature of ihc 
team, Kleinfclier believes, is helping 



Its overall effectiveness on defense 
and with rebounding. 

Junior Amy Pcrkltu had S a&amp;sisls on 
the night lo help her leap over the 
century mark for assists. Only four 
other players Imve broken the century 
assist marker.

Injuries hurt Volleydons 



By Michael Bass 
Sports Editor 

On Friday, Feb. 12, and Saturday, 
Feb. 13, the IPFW Volleydons travelled 
to Spiinglicld, Massachusscts to play in 
the WIeybflll Hall of Fame Classic. 

Four colleges were represented at the 
loumamcm; Springfield, Navy, George 
Mason, and IPFW. Tltc fint night IPFW 
played Navy, while George Mason 
played Springfield. 

The winners of the two matches 
played ihc following nighL The winners 
were George Mason over Springfield 
and IPFW over Navy. 

Jle -Volleydons defeated Navy in 
Ihice games; 17-15, 15-5, and 15-7. 

Against George Mason, 30 service er- 
rors cost IPFW ihe victory, losing in 
five games; 15-7. 15-17, 17-16,8-15, 
anii losing the last one 14-16, 

The Volleydons went to the tourna- 
ment two players shotl from injuries. 
Both Junior Norman Almodovar and 
sophomore Felipe Ralai suffered 
sprained ankles a week before in ihe 
Asics Grand Prix toumameni in San 
Diego, 

The two starters were replaced by 
sophomore Peter Kujak and freshman 
Brad Pricditis. 

Kujak played impressively against 
George Mason having 16 kills while 
malting only five spiking errors and al- 
so put down four service aces. 

Prledllls shined defensively having 
eight digs. He also had two blocks and 

four block assists,

ols (Priediiis and Kujak) we inserted in- 
to the line up," said coach Amic Ball. 

"I was not pleased overall. We had a 
very poor performance from our experi- 
enced players," continued coach Ball. 

Junior Lloy Ball and Senior Raul Pa- 
paleo both had seven service errors on 
the night against George Mason. 

Senior Qucntin Spiegel had 23 kills to 
Iced the icam against George Mason 
while Lloy Ball had 69 settings assists. 

Almodovar and Ralat are expected to 
return by next week. Coach BaJ! is call- 
ing it a day by day process and hopes 
they will return soon. 

Almodovar went down in a maich 
against Long Beach State. The match 
was tied at one game a piece and was 6- 
6 in the third game when Almodovar 
went down. IPFW ended up losing ihe 
match, 

"We weren't able to sustain the level 
we were at (before the injury) after that 
time," said coach Ball, 

Coach Ball feels the loss of two of his 
sianers affects the team dramatically. 
However, he feels that Kujak and 
Pricditis will gain experience and add 
lo the teams dimensions. 

There was one bright spot at the 



ASICS Grand F 

weeks ago. Lloy Ball was honored by 

being admiued to the ASICS 

The team is picked by the voting of 
the coaches at the tourney, but a conch 
. vote for his own player. 

"Lloy played very hard all three 
days," said coach Ball, "His intensity 
level and his hard play is very good," 

The team rclums home from two 
weeks of being on the road tomor- 
row, Friday, Feb. 19. They will host 
Winnipeg ai ihe HlUlard Gates 
Sports Center at 7:30. 

On Saturday, they will again host 
Winnipeg, also at 7;30 p.m., ^■■.

got HIV, you're going to 
die "before your time," 
and why would anyone 
want to know that? 

A, Medicines are now 
available that can prolong 
the period of good health 
and prevent illness In 
people with HIV. Belter 
treatments and possibly a 
cure may be found before 
those now Infected get sick 
or die. Also, If you are

"The other major piece is

prcssions In the third movement when 
he returns lo Vienna."

Tchaikovsky's" 1812 Ov enure,' 

"For the "1812 Ovcrairc,' there will 
be canons and chimes from the Scot-

ly great." said George Cavanaugh, as- 
sociate professor of Music and direc- 
tor of both groups. 

"This is the seventh consecutive 
year we ore doing this. The great thing 
about this. I think, is that we have mu- 
sicians from all over, ranging In age 
from eighteen to eighty, so there's no 
generation gap." said Cavanaugh.

L^i Sunday. Feb. 14. a new exhibi- 
tion by IPFW assistant professor of 
fine arts, John Hrehov opened In the 
Fine ARu Building. This exhibit fea- 
tures paintings, drawings, and prints 
which Hrehov has completed over a 
12 year period, from 1980 to 1992. 
These include several never shown 
before worlcs. 

Hrehov 's works have been featured 



in Washington. D.C; Louisville. KY; 
Elgin, 11!,. Fon Wayne. IN; and in 
New York City, where last March he 
won the Gladys Emerson Cook Prize 
for his charcoal drawing "Night Run 
Eternal" at the National Academy of 
Design's annual exhibition. 

Hrehov earned his B.F.A. in paint- 
ing from the Cleveland Institute of 
An in 1981. He received a M.F.A. 
from the University of Illinois in 
1985. Before joining the staff of 
IPFW, Hrehov taught at the Cleve-

of Illinois, and Judson College. He 
joined IPF\V's faculty four years ago 
as a visiting assistant professor in Tmc 
am. He was named assistant profes- 
sor of lire ans in 1992. 

Hrehov says that his work can be di- 
vided into two main sections, his old- 
er "figure pieces" and his more recent 
"personal narrative pieces". Common 
Imagery exists throughout his works, 

Hrchov's exhibit runs in the Fme 
Ans Building until March I2ih.
