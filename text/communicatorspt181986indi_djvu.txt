Research facility dedicated 



By MICHELE R. SHAFFER 
Editor-in-Chief 
"IPFW is an important and ever- 
growing component of our most livable 
city." Cosette Simon said Monday. 

Simon, director of finance and ad- 
ministration for Fort Wayne, 
represented Mayor Winfield Moses, Jr. 
at IPFW's dedication ceremony for the 
new SI. 240 million animal care facility. 
The facility, near completion, is 
located just off W. Campus Drive, north 
of Keltler Hall. The 900 square foot 
building will be used for the depart- 
ments of psychology and biological 
sciences, medical sciences and 
preventive dentistry research 
programs, Chancellor Thomas Wallace 
said Monday at the opening ceremony. 
"Perhaps the most interesting and 
exciting feature," Simon said, "is its 
potential to attract outstanding 
students." Prior to the construction of 
the facility, the university research 
involving animals on campus didn't 
"evencomeclose" to meeting state and 
federal guidelines for such research, 
Don Katter, spokesperson for the 
physical plant, told a Communicator 
reporter last month. 

The facility will include ten animal 
colony rooms, five project laboratories, 
a surgical suite, three quarantine and 
isolation rooms, lounge area and 
lavatories and showers. Although the 
current plans involve housing only 
relative small animals, like rodents, 
the capacity does exist to hold dogs and 
cats. One room is being outfitted to 
include house monkeys. 

James T. Schenkel, president of 
Schenkel and Schultz, Inc., and David 
T. School, project engineer for the same 
business, presented a key to the 
building to Purdue University 



President, Steven C. Bee ring, and 
Indiana University Vice President, W 
George Pinnell. 

"This is representative and symbolic. 
You might think it's (just) another 
symbolic event for me," Beering, the 
former dean of the Indiana University 
School of Medicine, told the audience of 
IPFW faculty and administrators, "but 
this is the conclusion of a 15-year 
dream." 

"We have to be at the cutting edge," 



Beering said "Every scientist must 
have the tools. (He) cannot just read 
about it in the books." 

Pinnell also addressed the audience 
after receiving the key to the building. 
"Something more symbolic is that we 
didn't ask for two keys," Pinnell told 
the audience of about 45 people. Pinnell 
was referring to the operating 
agreement IPFW has with Indiana 
University and Purdue University. "It 
symbolizes the partnership between 



our two universities." 

After the opening ceremonies, Bruce 
Abbott, chair of the animal care 
building program committee, and 
Douglas Lyng and Joel Vilensky led 
people on a guided tour of the new 
facility. 

The caretaker for the facility will be 

Carla Barrett, a technician certified by 
the American Association of 

Laboratory Animal Science lAALAS).

Students needed for Pan Am Games 

Volunteers earn 
credit for work 



ByJOHNMcGAULEY 
Staff Writer 

A "Once in a lifetime opportunity" is 
awaiting full timesludenls interested in 
an innovative way to earn internship 
credits Dr. Michael Charles, chairman 
of the criminal justice faculty at the 
School of Public and Environmental 
Affairs announced last week he is 
looking for 2,000 student volunteers to 
assist with security at the 1987 Pan 
American Games. 

The primary job of these volunteers, 
according to Charles, will to serve as 
"low key, eyes and ears, security 
assistants" during the games, to be 
held in Indianapolis next July 26 
through Aug. 23. However, before 
assignment as a security assistant, 
each volunteer will participate in a 
week-long training workshop, under the 
direction of FBI, Secret Service, and 
other security experts. 

Once certified, the student volunteers 
will be responsible for helping maintain 
security in areas such as the opening 
and closing ceremonies, the Athlete's 
Village, and individual game sites. 



Along with this, volunteers will also 
be assigned to parking, transportation 
and administrative security. locker 
room access, protecting perimeters, 
and providing escort services for 
dignitaries and games officials. 

While a particularly attractive option 
to students requiring internship credits, 
the program is open to everyone who 
meets the applicant requirements. 
Those electing to take the internship 
credits will have to pay the normal fee 
for them 

To qualify for the program, each 
individual must be at least IB years old 
by next summer and be a registered, 
full-time student. Each student must 
have a GPA of at least two on a scale of 
four, possess an interest in Ihe 
program, and because of the light 
security for the games, pass a 
background investigation. Students 
must also be available during the entire 
July 26-Aug. 23 timeframe. 

While volunteering their services for 
the games, students from outside the 
Indianapolis area will be provided with 
free university style housing. All

available in the area, such as the In-

Among other things, according to 
Charles, this program will give the 



volunteers a chance to work on an in-

a success. "It will certainly be on en-

science, in addition to honorary degrees 
from several universities. Obviously, his 
experience is great and varied, a 
necessity as president of IU , a university 
which includes campuses in 
Bloomington, East Richmond, Garv. 
Kokomo, South Bend, New Albany, 
Indianapolis and Fort Wayne, and which 
are responsible for the education of 
approximately 75,000 students. 



The question of whether or not to go 
outside of the IU system for a president 
may pose a problem. A much larger 
quantity of applicants can be found 
outside the system. Chancellors and vice 
presidents from colleges and 
universities across the country may 
contribute to IU applicants with the 
knowledge and ability a strong president 
needs. 

Yet a system as large as IU may need 
a president with previous affiliation to 
the school, someone within the eight 
campuses who is acquainted with IU and 
the policies, procedures, and traditions 
therein 

Perhaps the solution is a combination. 
Someone in the IU system, but with new 
blood, new ideas and a fresh outlook, a 
young administrator who can bring IU to 
new heights and grow with the 
university. 

The selection should be made as soon 
as possible. Naming Ryan's successor 
before his retirement allows time for 
Ryan to work along with the new 
president, lo introduce him to the duties 
and responsibilities of the position. 

We've reached a summit at IPFW 
through Ryan; we now consult him only 
on the major issues that affect us. This 
was probably the largest of several 
major changes in Ryan's 16 years as 
president. Let's hope his replacement 
does as well, for as long. 



Summer concert: a step 
in the right direction 




Imagine approximately 2000 students, 
IPFW students, crowding the 
ampitheater outside the Walb Memorial 
Union building, singing, cheering and 
clapping to the beat of a rock musician's 
music. 

Sound like something that could never 
happen at IPFW? 

If you answered yes, you were not 
there Sunday night to witness IPFW 
students whistling, howling and singing 
along with Henry Lee Summer, the rock 
musician whose single, "Got No Money" 
climbed to No. ■■ on the Indiana Music 
Survey chart. The Hoosier rock star, a 
native of Brazil, IN, performed at the 
request of IPFW's Student Union Board 
of Governors i SUBOG! 

The concert turned out to be one of the 
most successful events ever held on 
campus. Hopefully with the new 
chancellor's commitment to enhancing 
the quality of undergraduate life, more 
events like this can be pulled off 
successfully Chancellor Wallace has 
said he would like to see more social 
involvement of students at IPFW. This 
might be part of the answer. 

In the past, it has been difficult for 
students to conduct successful on- 
campus events, events so successful 
they would attract as many as 2000 
students. Part of the reason is there is no 
campus facility available that can house 
such a crowd. The capacity of the Walb 
Ballroom is only 400 and thus is not 



appropriate for such a sizeable group. 
Maybe part of the university's 
commitment to fine arts could include a 
theater that would be more appropriate 
for such events, as well as other musical 

performances and concerts. Purdue 

University's concert hall is a fine To J he . ed . itor 
example of what IPFW could have. 

It is evident that students have 
demonstrated their willingness to 
cooperate with the administration by 
making proper advance arrangements, 
and carefully picking up the grounds 
after the Summer concert was held. The 
university must now recognize that

"The cave" is a very nice

without a lot of noise — 
something hard to do

The cafeteria has a long wall

anyone who would like lo be

To address another topic

IPFW certainly didn't ask

Law school needed 

To the Editor: 

IPFW is in fact becoming a 
more progressive 
educational institution, one 
more responsive to the 
growing surrounding 
community. This is 
evidenced by the relaUvely 
new medical school 
program, as one example. 

I wonder if there has been 
any serious consideration 
toward bringing a law school 
program to this campus? 
Could it be as expensive to 
implement as the medical 

With the astronomical 
costs of educabon il becomes 
increasingly more difficult

opinion that a law school, or

received here, not only for 
economic reasons but also

Mastodons win four at IPFW Invitational Jim Sharpe: First-year coach 

relates well to veteran players 



By JENNY BLAKLEY 
Staff Writer 

This weekend was a busy 
one for IPFW's women's 
volleyball team. They hosted 
the IPFW Women's 
Volleyball Invitational, 

which included 13 teams 
from around the Tri-State 
urea and elsewhere. 

These teams were divided 
into three "pools." IPFW 
playing in pool A on the first 
court. Each of these teams 
played the best two out of 
three games (in pool A). 

The Mastodons began play 
Friday evening, defeating 
Hillsdale, 15-11, 15-5- 

After a three hour break, 
they competed against Saint 
Francis and won, 15-5, 15-11. 

Play continued on 
Saturday morning, and the 
Mastodons played their third 
game of (he tourney [PFW 
was again victorious, this 
lime against Mount Saint 
Joe. 11-15, 15-6 and 15-5. 
Michigan Tech was the 
Mastodon's next foe, and 
IPFW beat them in a close 
match, 15-7. 10-15, 15-5. 

The quarterfinals proved 
to be the final match for the 
Mastodons, Mount Saint Joe, 
whom IPFW had defeated 
earlier in the day, shut the 
Maslodons out of the tour- 
ney, by a heart-breaking 
score of 12-15, 15-13, 15-17.

A new addition has been 
made to the coaching staff 
Jim Orr, the assistant 
volleyball coach, hails from 
Middletown, Ohio. He was a 
coach at Finwick High 
School, as well as Wit- 
ten burg University. Orr was 
also Ball's assistant coach at 
thel983SportsFesttval. "We 
are very pleased to have him 
here," Ball comments 
"Along with Clara Shortgen 
and Lisa Sheehan, we have a 
nice coaching staff," 

Several tough teams 
remain on the Mastodon's 
schedule, including Northern 
Kentucky, West Point, 
Wright State, and Grand 
Valley, who finished second 
in the Invitational last

"It's an ■ 
you don't have to be 6'10' 
■ igh 






5'5" and be as good as 
anybody. It's jtisi basic 
hand-eye and fool-eye 
coordination 

Even though this is Jim 
Sharpe's first year coaching 
men's soccer al IPFW, the 
team has responded well to 
him. Sharpe. who played for 
the IPFW soccer team for 
four years, feels thai the 
good response is because he 
knew most of the players 
before he started coaching. 
"I played with probably six 
of the guys when I was a 
senior in '83 and ihcy were 
freshmen. Also, I play it lot 
of summer soccer with all of 
them on Ihe same team," 
said Sharpe 

IPFW's first game was 
Sept. S against Northern 
Kentucky The Maslodons 



lost in overtime, 3-2. Coach 
Sharpe, even though he 

wanted to win, was satisfied 
with the way the team 
played. "The game showed 
some good things," stated 

IPFW's most outstanding 
soccer players are Bronn 

Commentary 

Pfeifer, Juan Diaz. Ronny 
Harkenrider, and Ricky 
DeLatorra. According to 
Sharpe, these are the guys 
with excellent soccer skills. 
"DeLatorra, he's a good 
shot!" exclaimed Sharpe. 
IPFW is a team of the 
veterans with eight players 
returning from last year. 
IPFW is an experienced 
team with a lot of soccer 
skills but they aren't a 
physical team. "Being a 
skilled team is better but, 
like last Saturday against 
Northern Kentucky, they 



played a physical game and 
that hurt us because the 
referee didn't call the game 
too light. Northern Kentucky 
took advantage of the 
situation," confessed coach 
Sharpe The team to beat 
this year is Lewis Univer- 
sity. They were ranked 18th 
in the preseason poll. The 
best team the Mastodons 
ploy may be Oakland. They 
are ranked in the Top 10 of 
Division 2 in the nation 

There aren't any women 
on the team but Sharpe isn't 
closing doors. "To be totally 
honest, I haven't seen any 
girls that could play. 
Division 2 is fairly com- 
petitive." 

As far as the future of the 
soccer teams at IPFW, 
Sharpe is going to have to do 
some major recruiting 
because he'll be losing five

Brogan looks for improvement

Stair Writer 
The IPFW women's tennis 
team started out Ihe season 
by losing to SI Francis on 
Saturday, Sepl 6 by a 5-4 
score- 
Dan Brogan, women's 
tennis coach lor two years, 
wasn't upsei with the girls 
play for two reasons U St. 
Francis is ranked 22 in the 
division, and 31 He blames 
the loss on the team's 
inexperience "Ljstyearwe 
only played two matches. 
Most of the girls on the learn 
quit so we didn'l have a 
team. This is a rebuilding 
year," said Coach Brogan. 
The top two seeds on the 
team are Laura Rhodes, 
freshman, and Manju 
Usman, sophomore, 

"The loss of playing last 
year and just building a 
team this year aren't the 



ingredients of a winning 
team," emphasized Brogan. 
"It's up to the players to 
attend practice and improve 
themselves, Tennis is an 
individual sport," added 
Brogan. 

Brogan has no desire to 
expand the playing zone of 
Ihe leam because most of the 
players commute and have 
jobs. "We usually play twice 



a week and most of our 
games are only an hour 
away. This schedule fits us 



Brogan has high ex- 
pectations for the future 
teams at IPFW and he in- 
vites anybody to come join 
the team. He's willing to 
teach the basics. All you 
need to do is contact him.
