KKK to demonstrate in Fort Wayne 



Klan's shady past 



by No] Beckley 
Editor and 
Rebecca Koenig 
Chief Reporter 

On January 13, the Ku Klux Klan will be 
demonstrating ils right to free speech on the 
steps of the Fort Wayne Courthouse. 

According to Elizabeth Dobynes of the 
NAACP, the Klan is demonstrating in 
response to the unification celebrations 
which have been planned and have been a 
part of the annual Martin Luther King Jr. 
holiday commemoration. 

The NAACP. Urban League and the 
Lincoln Museum have coordinated a cele- 
bration which will fall on Saturday also. 
This is not a response to the Klan, according 
to Dobynes, hut a "celebration of diversity " 



Dobynes also sajd the NAACP will meet at 
Headwaters Park during the Klan rally 

The Klan's demonstration has highlight- 
ed the Martin Luther King Jr, events, 
according to Dobynes 

"It's a little extra garnish." she said 

Kelu-Omowala Oladuwa, managing edi- 
tor of Frosl Illustrated, said, "My firs! 
response is, "Who cares?'" 

Oladuwa went on to say neither event 
carried much weight in his opinion If the 
Klan came into his neighborhood, life for 
the Klan would gel difficult. 

"The Klan can't come into my communi- 
ty Period." Oladuwa said According to 
Oladuwa. the Klan is looking for publicity 
and if they receive it they will have succeed- 
ed. 

Public Safety Director Payne Brown said 



he supports the Klan's nght to assemble but 
disagrees with their message Brown also 
said he hopes the demonstration will end 
without any violence. 

Brown said the city will provide more 
police officers, close streets and conduct 
physical searches to ensure safety and a 
peaceful demonstration. 

IPSGA President Kevin Eads said. "The 
Klan breeds ignorance; ignorance breeds 
hate. Dr. King stood for a message of love 
and equality for all humankind." 

Eads added the legacy of King is still 
alive at 1PFW and is admired and respected 
by many of the students and also by himself 

"If 1 could wipe out all hatred and racism 
in our community, I would do it immediate- 
ly Unfortunately, 1 can only encourage our 
citizens to ignore the KJan's message and 



refuse to give any validity to iheir beliefs 

"We need to recognise the teachings of 
Martin Luther King Jr. and work to end all 
divisiveness and racism in our community," 
said Mayor Paul Helmke. 

Many downiown businesses will be 
closed for safety during the Klan demonstra- 
tion but some entrepreneurs arc fighting to 
stay open in spite of the situation Russ 
Choka, owner of Coney Island Wiener 
Stand on Main Street, is considering slaying 
open on Saturday. 

"I don't believe the people are that bad in 
Fori Wayne." Choka said Choka also com- 
pared the closings to communism and does 
not want any part of it 

"I want to slay open This is what they do 
in communist countries, we don'i want 
that." be said.

When thinking of the Ku Klux Klan, 
ihe average American is likely to visu- 
alize a group of white men in bed 
sheets riding horses around a country 
farm throughout the Civil War period. 
While the Klan was established during 
that period, it has changed grcady in 
yeans past. Much of the KKK's history 
has been forgotten While ihe concept 
behind the Klan is secrecy, some infor- 
mation can be found

Lesbian activist to speak at IPFW 



by Erie Ledbctter 
Copy Editor 

Donna Red Wing, national field 
director of (be Gay Lesbian 
Alliance Against Defamation 
(GLAAD), will be in Fort Wayne 
on Jan. 19-21. She is presenting a 
lecture on homophobia and hale 
crimes in Walb Union 224 from 10 
a_m to 12 p.m. on Jan. 19. 

Toe gay activist v. til participate 
in several workshops the following 
day at tie Fort Wayne Women's 
Bureau, located at 303 E. 
Washington Blvd. On Sun . Jan. 
21, Red Wing will lead a panel dis- 
cussion ai the Fori Wayne Cinema 
Center, following ihe 4:30 p in 
showing of "Ballot Measure 9." 

The film depicts the heated 
political balde which arose over a 
1992 ballot initiative which would 
have prohibited the passage of 
ordinances and laws protecting the 
rights of gay and lesbian citizens in 
the state of Oregon. The Oregon 
Lesbian Community Project, of 
which Red Wing was ihe executive 
direcior at the time, participated 
extensively in the drive to defeat 
ihe referendum. She is portrayed 
in the film 

Red Wing's appearance is spon- 
sored by several organizations 
including: Fori Wayne Cinema 
Center. IPFW Women's Studies. 
Ricbardville Inc and ihe Fort 
Wayne Women's Bureau, along 



with IPFW's Diversity Council and 
Alternative Lifestyle Sludeni 
Organisation (ALSO) 

"The purpose of ihe woikshop is 
basically education, to show the 
seriousness of homophobia and the 
violence il leads lo." Nancy Cripe, 
director of the Women's Bureau 
said. "By bringing Donna Red 
Wing here to Fort Wayne, we are 
attempting to take a proactive 
stance, rather than wailing until 



something happens here like wbai 
happened in Oregon, and then 
being forced to react." 

"We are very anxious to sponsor 
the event along with ALSO and ihe 
Diversity Council," said Women's 
Studies Director Linda Fox. "We 
all need lo be educated aboul those 
who are different from us. and it's 
a lifelong process" 

Organizers are uncertain about 
Ihe size of turnout for the sched- 



uled events but say enthusiasm is 
increasing as more people are 
informed 

"We have done lois of adver- 
tisement," said Cripe "We just 
mailed out 300 letters to individu- 
als and organizations, including 
local churches, elected officials.

On Tuesday, January 9, Sludeni 
Government President Kevin Eads 
appointed George Gounaris and 
Andre Fux to his cabinet. 

Eads said he hopes to add fresh 
outlooks and provide a louder voice 
for students. "Geo [Gounans) is an 
outspoken advocate for students," 
Eads said. "He won't back down on 
the tough issues." 

Fux will offer a completely dif- 
ferent perspective toward 
Multicultural Affairs and toward the 
International Student Organization, 
according to Eads. 

"I am looking forward to work- 
ing with them." Eads said. 

Gounans steps into ihe office of 
Director of Interior and Exterior 
Affairs and Fux will be Director of 
Multicultural Affairs. Last semester 
only Chris Douse served on ihe 
president's cabinet as Chief of 
Staff. Douse will continue to serve 
at that position. 

Douse said ihe issues that will he 
dealt with in the beginning will be 
the ones Fux and Gounans bring 
up. Fux said he plans to emphasize 
diversity in the classes and recruit- 
ment of students. Fux has also 
served as president of tbe Hispanos 
Unidos. 

Bom in Panama City, Panama, 
Fux said he would like to see more 
courses concerning Hispanics,

als These classes will help recruit 
students of color according to Fux. 

Gounaris said this position will 
allow him to go through doors thai 
had previously been hard lo open as 
a student. He said be hopes to con- 
tinue to make waves in the IPSGA 
Senate Gounaris has been a student 
senator for a few years. 

"Their primary job will be lo 
advise me about [governmental] 
affairs." Eads said of the cabinet. 

The president's cabinet was 
formed in December of 1994 by 
then IPSGA President Mark King 
At the time ihe cabinet's purpose 
was to "enlist the aid of fellow stu- 
dents to help manage ihe wide vari- 
ety of sludeni government programs 
and initiatives," according to King's 
executive order. 

King dissolved the cabinet short- 
ly thereafter citing IPSGA "infight- 
ing" among senators during last 
year's election as the main cause for 
disbanding the cabinet 



University makes plans for new science building 



by Rebecca Koerdg 
Chler Reporter 

The deadline for acccpluig con- 
struction bids on the new science 
building is Jan. 18. 

The building will be buUl on the 
west side of what is currently 
Parking Lot #11, flush with the 
north side of the Life Sciences 
Resource Building. The chemistry, 
biology, and geo sciences depart- 
ments will be housed in ihe new 
science budding. 

"We hope to see thai it gets 
started in April," said Vice 
Chancellor of Financial Affairs. 
Walt Branson 

Tbe budding should be complet- 
ed in the fall of 1998. Once the 
departments of chemistry, biology. 
and geo sciences move to the new 
science building, renovations on 



space occupied currenUy by ihese 
departments can begin. This reno- 
vation depends on approval for 
anoiher $4.7 million from tbe 
Indiana General Assembly. 
Currendy the space could be used 
for traditional classrooms, but con- 
venience would be sacrificed due 
to the lab type environment accord- 
ing to Branson. 

Construction of the new build- 
ing will have a negative impact on 
ihe parking situation, according to 
Branson. Because of the science 
building's location. Lot 1 1 and part 
of the adjoining lot will no longer 
be usable 

The science building is only the 
first step in ihe masier plan for 
IPFW which is expected to take 25 
years to complete. The masier plan 
provides for enrollment, new pro- 
grams, better scenery, and more

KKK. has lost its voice 



You may or may not know, or 
hopefully don'i care, the Ku Klux 
Klan is holding a rally Saturday in 
front of the Courthouse in down- 
town Fori Wayne. There is also 
going to be a big gathering — per- 
haps bigger than ihe Klan — in 
protest of tbe values and haired the 
Klan exudes. We at The 
Communicator do noi support this 
protest. 

We do believe the KKK has a 
constitutional right to peacefully 
gather Peaceful gathering and 
marches bring aboul unity and 
eiiLibUM.i-.ni foi the cause. Bui histo- 
ry has shown us the KKK is not 
aboul peace. Many blacks, Jews 
and gays have died or painfully suf- 



fered because of the Klan's vicious, 
tnbal rituals that arc far from being 
peaceful. 

Many al IPFW are planning 10 
attend the protest In thai crowd, 
you can expect lo see a colorful 
rainbow of diversity, including a 
large, while representation This 
can only mean one thing: ihe KKK 
has losi its power. 

It is true thai the white suprema- 
cists are feeling the heal. In 1990, 
according 10 Ronald Takaki's "A 
Different Mirror: A Hislory of 
Multicultural America." Time mag- 
azine published a cover story on 
"America's Changing Colors" that 
slated by 2056, while Americans 
will become a minority group of 



their own. 

The KKK may try 10 compare ils 
gathering to that of the Million Man 
March. But in order lo accomplish 
this, they had better make some 
changes. For one, change ihe name 
"Ku Klux Klan" is a name associat- 
ed with hate and rage Maybe a bel- 
ter name would be NAWP - The 
National Association of White 
Pride. 

Secondly, the organization would 
have to stand for peace, as do the 
NAACP, NOW and ACT UP. And 
lastly, tbe group would have to be 
able to work with oiher minority 
groups. For years, gay organiza- 
tions have aided women's rights 
and pro-choice bailies Jews cele- 



brated Jackie Robinson's climb lo 
professional baseball. A work- 
together while organuation would 
be more effective than the current 
halc-mongcring white hoods that 
will gather Saturday. 

If you want lo answer their rage, 
Iry this: ignore them Don'l rally 
against their views, that is what 
Ihey want. Think back to when you 
were a child and your elementary 
teacher was combating a class 
clown. She told you lo ignore him 
and he'd soon go away. You'll find 
that M&gt;s. Craptree's advise still 
works today.

Prohibition lament 



by Tim Wenlhe 
Guest Columnist 

As a dipsomaniacal pupil daily 
tarrying upon the IPFW campus, 
atlending lectures and then lack- 
adaisically yawning as 1 awail the 
next pedagogue's sapient spiel, lec- 
tures which are often separated by 
tedious hours. I find the prohibition 
of spirits a bane to my intellectual 
boon, and I'd wager this is a bane 
not specific lo my boon but a banc 
lo Ihe entire student body, who, I'd 
further wager, wouldn't mind a 
quick guaff of aqua vitae between 
classes — if only to loosen their 
tongues I'd furthermore wager thai 
prohibition and ils consequence, 
sobriety, arc why the pupil popu- 
lace superficially appears to be a 
corpus of ostensibly pensive reclus- 
es contemplating ennui; whereas in 
actuality each and every one of us 
resenis collegiaie leetotalism and 
earnestly desires a quick quaff of 
aqua viiae in order to collectively 
vent our pent via bohemian was- 
sailing, hence transmogrifying ihe 
ossified structure of academia inio 
a daft brouhaha. 

To reiterate: outlawed spirits is a 
bane to the student body's boon 
This is evidenced by pupils who, in 
search of convalescence between 
classes, rather than hobnobbing 
mirthfully in a snug pub. are foisted 



by radical non-smoking statutes, 
alfresco where they cluster in small 
conclaves, smoking cigarettes and 
exchanging choice execrations in 
order lo vent their frustrated pent, 
quivering all the while as sleet and 
other intemperate biles pelt their 
naked napes In fact, while triapsen 
pasi Helmke I overheard a pupil 
sharing this colorful grievance: 
"BLASTED BLOODY BUZ- 
ZARDS! I WAS JUST STAND- 
ING HERE SMOKEN MY CIG 
WHEN THIS FAT GOOSE SHAT 
ON MY CHERRY, DOUSING 
MY DAMN CIG! DAMN, MAN! 
THAT WAS MY LAST ONE! 
DAMN THAT GOOSE. A BET- 
TER FIRE FIGHTER THAN 
KURT RUSSELL IN 'BACK- 
DRAFT!"' This grievance, of 
course, is directly due lo atmos- 
phere. If prohibition were lifted 
then no doubl this bitching pupil 
would be relishing his cig over a 
pint of stout in a pub situated in 
Walb Union, it being the student's 
building and thereby the most 
social edifice on campus, and situ- 
ated snug in just such a pupil's pub 
he would, rather than bitching at 
fat- fire -fighting buzzards, rubicund 
with joy and garrulously ejaculat- 
ing amusing anecdotes about when, 
as a child, he sadistically leveled 
ant hills A fellow pupil, attending 
the pub on a gregarious whim as 



well as for a dainly of sherry, 
would be found listening to this 
yokel's anecdote with keen interest, 
laughing heartily as the bilching 
pupil disclosed that once, while on 
safari in Africa, he had derived 
immaculate joy from leveling a 
particularly pestilent termite 
mound, the likes of which was over 
len feel high "I first hired me an 
indentured servant and then we, me 
and him, we went lo work terminat- 
ing the termite mound." says this 
bilching pupil, his face ruddy from 
rubicund joy, his anecdote arriving 
al a closure wherein ihe indentured 
servant gets his arse bii by a baby 
hyena whose mother had burrowed 
a lair into Ihe mound. The fellow 
pupil, having jusi thoroughly masti- 
cated the bar nuts into bolus, guf- 
faws deeply at this fantastic eccen- 
tricity, inquiring, between hems 
and haws resulting from ihe respi- 
ratory priority of laughter, of the 
bilching pupil as lo whether or not 
the indeniured servant's haunch 
had swelled Fresh afier having 
enunciated this question the bar- 
tender, the bitching pupil and ihe 
pub proper are splurged wiih 
peanut butter. 

And to only imagine! All this 
amicable rapport between and 
amongst IPFW pupils if only prohi- 
bition were lifted!

EACS- Not as Christian as they think 



Wiih the fury of the holiday sea- 
son or the stress of finals week or 
even the lack of interest in news 
itself, you may have missed a news 
item thai caused healed debates 
behind closed doors throughout 
Fori Wayne. I am talking aboul 
East Allen County Schools fEACS) 
Board of Trustees condemning the 
National Education Association's 
1995 resolution that designates the 
month of October as Gay Lesbian 
Hislory Month. What did you miss 
and why am I pissed.' Read on... 

Tbe resolution, known as 
National Conference Resolution B- 
9. stated mat raising awareness and 
increasing sensitivity regarding sex- 
ual orientation was important to 
create positive atmospheres for 
those who are homo- or bisexual, 
and those who are not. In doing so. 
stereotyping would be eliminated 
and positive relations would be cre- 
ated between people who arc gay or 
bi and those who would normally 
feel uncomfortable around these 
people. 

One method by which ibis 
would be accomplished would be to 
acknowledge the sexual orieniation 
of historical figures who were gay, 
lesbian and bisexual and (o accu- 
rately portray their contributions 
This would allow children to under- 
stand thai gays and bisexuals (i.c 
Wall Whitman, Oscar Wilde. Ernest 
Hemingway) have always been in 
existence and have made clearly 
important contributions to society 
and hislory. Lesbian and Gay 
History Month would also be cele- 
brated and supported like any other 
hislory monih. such as February's 
Black Hislory Month. 

Another way would be to elimi- 
nate sexual orieniation name-call- 
ing and jokes in the classroom This 
would mean adding sexual orienta- 
tion to discussions already used 
when educaLing the students about 
diversity, siereotyping and toler-

This doesn't 
seem like a loi to 
ask. But it was to 
EACS. Their reso- 
lution not only 
condemned the 
NEA's resolution. 
but also went on lo 
say homosexuality 
contradicts the 
laws of nature and 
does noi represent 
the Christian views the school sys- 
tem holds This is wbai really set 
me off. 

I want to meet the fool that 
thinks every student in EACS is 
Christian What aboul the Jewish 
students? The atheist students? The 
Buddhist students? Shouldn't they 
have a view? 

I want to meet ihe fool who for- 
got the American experiment 
known as "separation of church and 
itate." EACS are public school 




what they doi 

you and I do know, is thai REAL 
Christians do noi have these biases 
against gays. Most people believe 
that gays — and in this case gay 
children — deserve ihe same basic 
digmly and respect allotted to other 
humans. 

Now we can gel into extensive 
fights about the Bible and its teach- 
ings. We can argue for hours aboul 
inierpreiation and translation. We 
could even debate until our deaths 
that are not allowed by law to rep- aboul me tn,e P^^ o( ^ Bible. 
resent any single religion. If they Bul what we would have lo a 8 ree

that gays should be discriminated 
against. They may not understand 
homo- or bisexuality — a problem 
(hat would taper with future genera- 
tions under Ihe NEA resolution — 
bul they don't condemn them 
either. 

It is this son of mentality thai 
any alternative lifestyle community 
must battle. What we have is a 
small group of big mouthed 
Christians who use ethnocentrism 
as their key defense against us But 



their schools. It's really sad to see 
lhat their efforts are meaningless. 
Gays are everywhere anil cannot be 
kept away (even from tbe military). 
Gays, lesbians and bisexuals are 
more and more becoming parents 
themselves and you may find lhat 
there are already some of these 
families in your children's schools 
EACS did noi win a battle, they 
merely looked foolish and in pub- 
lic at that.

Boomer Box, 
part I 

To the students, 

You say you have kids older 
lhan youf instructor? And you 
have underwear that's older than 
most of your classmates? Is thai 
what's bothering you? You're 
not alone You need to get used 
10 it, and you will, It took guts 
to crawl back on to the wagon at 
your age. You've been able to 
back most of the slings and 
arrows so far. and you're going 
lo hack this The strange time 
warp feeling goes away as you 
gel absorbed in (he subjects 
you're learning The most 
important issue is the aci of 
learning itself Thai's more fun 
than anything Take 

Bioanthropnlogy from Kuznar. 
Take Cultural Anthropology 
from Provost. I guarantee it'll 
set you free 

Oh, you mean you're here lo 
get your ticket punched so you 
can make more money out there 
in happy jobland? Whoops. 
Forget thai. Happy jobland just 
caught a bus that's screaming 
down the side of a mountain and 
nobody's driving, All the corpo- 
rate dipdunks who arc supposed 
to be driving the bus arc busy 
trying to loot the baggage com- 
partment, and they're not going 
lo take the wheel any time soon. 
That's right, we went through all 
thai bright and shining quality 
and customer satisfaction 
schmooze only to learn that our 
sole reason for existence is to 
make the stockholders rich. 

You didn't own any stock, 
did you? You jumped (or were 
thrown ofO ihat bus without 
your golden parachute Well, 
that's the had news. The good 
news is, the future can be a 
whole loi belter for all of us if 
we all chose to participate. Does 
that mean Bigbueks Company is 
going lo let you climb aboard 
that gravy train with your fresh 
new degree? Well, if that's your 
perception of a better future (for 
all of us), get ready for more 
slings and arrows. The operative 
phrase here is, "for all of us." 
That means we're going to have 
to get organized. 

No. we don't have to have a 
big meeting and elect officers 
and draw up a quorum. Thai's 
history We have to get on the 
same philosophical page. This 
will start with the realization thai 
the political spectrum doesn't 
run left lo right It runs top to 
bottom. Nobody has anything 
against hard work and initiative. 
But when you pass under the 
gate that says. "Arbeit Macht 
Ftci," it's too late to get suspi- 
cious Whoops. That wasn't a 
gravy train at all, was if? 

The good news is. we don't 
have to vote in the street and gel 
our heads cracked any more

Letters to the Editor 



Business school ethics conflict with Bulletin 



To the editor: 

It's Thanksgiving break 
Students are enjoying their last 
chance of relaxation before diving 
into the last few frenzied weeks of 
the semester — weeks in which 
months of learning give way 10 
papers, projects, presentations and 
final exams. For students in the 
School of Business and 
Management Sciences (SBMS) this 
tranquillity was ruined with the 
arrival of a letter from the Director 
of Undergraduate Student Affairs. 
SBMS. The letter was dated 
November 20, 1995 and although 
the Director was only the messen- 
ger with bad news, its arrival on the 
24th led lo a great deal of frustra- 
tion toward her. No action could be 
taken until Monday and Monday 
there would be no time. 

This letter addressed the issue of 
dual concentrations/double majors. 
In the past, students had been per- 
mitted to have a double major if 
they completed Ihc courses 
required. The letter stated 
"Effective immediately, dual con- 
centrations within 123 credit hours 
will no longer be available, with an 
exception made only for students 
completing a degree in the 1995-96 
academic year.'' The letter further 
staled that students wishing to pur- 
sue dual concentrations would be 
required to complete a minimum of 
another 18 credits for the second 
concentration. 

It is our opinion that the imple- 
mentation of the accreditation poli- 
cy change was a unilateral decision 
made with very little forethought 
given to the consequences to and 
impact on the students involved. 
The involved students are those 
who declared a double major when 
they were admitted lo the School of 
Business and Management 



Sciences Many of these students 
have completed courses in boih 
concentrations All were promised 
the degree with both majors if they 
completed the required courses 

We spoke with the Dean of 
SBMS on January 2. 1996 concern- 
ing the IPFW Bulletin and the dou- 
ble major issue. Dean Lane pointed 
out that there was only one business 
degree program with several con- 
centrations. The degree is a 
Bachelor of Science, Business 
Administration from Indiana 
University. This is the same for all 
business students regardless of their 
major. This indicates lhat the dou- 
ble major referenced in the Bulletin 
does not apply to SBMS The con- 
cern of SBMS is maintaining 
accreditation We respect this, but 
our interpretation of the Bulletin is 
different 

When students were admitted to 
SBMS, they sat down with the 
Director to declare their major At 
this lime, a document (commonly 
known as bingo sheet) based upon 
the IPFW Bulletin was completed 
showing their course and dual con- 
centration requirements Referenced 
in this document was the applicable 
IPFW Bulletin The Bulletin refer- 
enced on our document was the 
1994/96 revision The issue of dou- 
ble majors is addressed on page 104 
and this is where our interpretation 
differs from that of the 
Administration The Bulletin stales 
"If you complete all the require- 
ments for more than one program, 
you will be awarded a degree with a 
double major if &lt; I ) the requirements 
are completed at the same lime: (2) 
the programs are offered by the 
same school or division and the 
same university at IPFW; and (3) 
the programs lead to the same 
degree... B.A. (IU or Purdue), 
B.F.A., B.S. (Purdue only)..." The 



Dean indicated to us that "one pro- 
gram" refers to the Bachelor of 
Science. Business Administration 
As ihis is headed under "Double 
Majors and Double Degrees." we 
interpreted "more lhan one pro- 
gram" as "more than one major." 
Thai SBMS has set precedence by 
allowing students for several years 
to graduate with a double major 
based on this criteria further sup- 
ports our interpretation. 

If we were to go with the 
Administration's interpretation, 
then we would refer back to page 
103 of the Bulletin where the 
requirements for degrees are found 
Staled is "If you enier a degree cer- 
tificate program, you will be 
required to fulfill ihc requirements 
published in the Bulletin at the 
time of your most recent entry or 
re-entry into that program at 
IPFW... Any new requirement for a 
degree or certificate program may 
not be imposed on currently 
enrolled students in these programs 
if it would increase ihe number of 
credits or the number of semesters 
required for the completion of the 
program " The courses required for 
the concentrations/majors are listed 
on pages 46 and 47 of the Bulletin 
We use concentrations/majors here 
because the Bulletin uses them 
interchangeably and our transcripts 
list them not as "concentrations" 
but as "majors." 

We feel the letter of November 
29, 1995 was an attempt by SBMS 
to breach the contracts it made with 
us when it accepted us into the 
Business Degree Program. This 
breach constitutes fraud. The stu- 
dents have paid for courses and 
were (old the double major was 
available By accepting the students

inio the Business Degree Program 
and not delivering the services (hey 
promised, SBMS is "stealing" from 
those students We understand revi- 
sions to the IPFW Bulletin arc nec- 
essary to ensure future compliance 
with accreditation standards and 
continued accreditation from the 
Amencan Assembly of Collegiate 
Schools of Business. However, 
IPFW and SBMS have a legal and 
ethical responsibility to the students 
currently admitted to the Business 
Degree Program Also, with declin- 
ing college enrollment, universities 
lhat are going to survive and ihrivc 
are the ones that are going to reach 
a compromise between students and 
ever changing academic standards 

We further realize that IPFW is 
seen "only" as an extension of the 
main campus To the students pay- 
ing for an education, however, 
IPFW is much more. It is the foun- 
dation from which we will build our 
careers These professors bring to 
(he classroom impeccable creden- 
tials, years of experience and the 
latest knowledge from the business 
world What they are teaching is 
not )usi the mechanics of business, 
but what makes a business success- 
ful in today's global environment. 

A key issue in every business 
course we have taken has been ethi- 
cal responsibility which starts with 
each individual and with each orga- 
nization The professors understand 
this, the students understand this: 
perhaps the administrators need lo 
return lo the classroom so they, too, 
can understand this 

SBMS has indicated to us that it 
is willing to work with the students 
in fulfilling course requirements 
necessary for graduation in May of 
1996 This is contingent upon 



enough students signing up for the 
courses and approval of the 
University. All courses will need to 
be completed by the end of the sec- 
ond summer session of 1996 

We arc willing to help other stu- 
dents with Ihe necessary arrange- 
ments but we do not feci the legal 
issue here is as clear as SBMS 
would have us believe. We are ask- 
ing lhat any students admitted lo the 
Business Degree Program pnor to 
November 20, 1995 and affected by 
the policy change on dual majors 
join us in our efforts. Together we 
can make a difference. If you arc 
interested, please leave your name 
and phone number for Bobhi in the 
Students Activities Office [who is 
acting only as a collecting point and 
docs not necessarily share Ihe same 
views as ihis letter), 481-6609 

In closing, we would like to add 
that it is our hope that when this 
issue is resolved it will have been 
done so noi because it was the legal 
thing to do, but because it was the 
right thing to do.

'Waiting to Exhale' a fresh breath; 'Nixon' a drag 



hy Amanita Man ton 
Feature* Editor 

Kort Wayne movie theaters are 
finally able to breath easy with the 
long -awaited anival ol "Waiting to 
Exhale ." Staring Angela Bavtfl and 
Whitney Houston. the lllm chroni- 
cles a year in the romantic lives of 
five African- American women liv- 
ing In Arizona. 

"Waiting to linhale" is oue of 
the fifM films to reach theaters 
nation-wide (hat caters to a black 
middle-class audience. In recent 
years, films targeting (he black 
audience typically depict inner-city 
life, often focusing on crime, drug- 
D*e and gang violence. Women arc 
repeatedly used in story lines as ibe 
icccivlng objects of male lust, sec- 
ondary to lie plot 

In comparison 10 other films tar- 
geting black audiences, the produc- 
ers of "Wailing to Exhale" have 
brought a refreshing mid uplifting 
depiction of the modern African- 
American woman to the screen. The 
film, based on the highly successful

life. Female characters in the film 
arc portrayed as powerful black 
women, although they continue to 
struggle with the temptation lo rely 
on men to establish sclf-wortb, 
Through the course of the film, they 
overcome this reliance and in the 
end reaffirm their confidence as 
well as the bonds of their friend- 
ship. 

Basset and Houston do a con- 
vincing job of portraying their char- 
acters, as docs the rest of the cast. 
Houston's performance in the film 
should lend a certain amount of 
credibility to the well-known musi- 
cian's acting career. Throughout the 
entire film Houston's character 
burns only a few pilches and leaves 
the music up to the incredible 
soundtrack. 

"Ihe film's only possible down- 
fall is that it presents a slanted view 
of (he relationship between African- 
American men and women If 



audience members view the film 
without thinking critically after- 
wards, they may leave with the idea 
that male/female African-American 
relationships typically occur within 
the content of entra-manial affairs. 
Three out of the five relationships 
that compose the plot concern 
female characters cavorting wilh 
married meo. Even though there is 
an emphasis on the affairs, ihe film 
does not condone them and each 
woman maintains her self-respect. 
The film also addresses the issue of 
interracial relationships within the 
context of the affairs. 

Viewing this film is truly a 
unique experience. Hurling com- 
ments and react ions at the screen, 
audience members decidedly take a 
participatory role in (heir theater

reeling that these women will go on 
wi(h their lives and overcome any 
obs(acles which might happen onto 
their paths.

How could I have been so com- 
pletely wrong? 1 was under the 
impression that Olivet Sione could 
do no cinematic wrung I thought 
he was ihe best thing that had hap- 
pened to feature film in years. 

Then along came "Nixon." 
Stone rambles on for well over 
three hours without al(cmp(ing lo 
come to a concrete point. The film 
is saturated wnb the kind of flash- 
backs and fantasy digressions that 
have made Stone famous. They are 
used lo justify an extremely cruel 
portrayal of Nixon which paints 
him as a sniveling, whiny bnii with 
a mother fixation. 

"Nixon" tells the siory of a 
young man from a poor family who 
waiches two of his brothers die of 
typhoid fever. Young Nixon has an 
embittered, blue collar father and a 
Bible-quoting, Old-English speak- 
ing mother who pushes him into a 
career in law. Nixon, according to 
Slone. is never able (o slop living 



for his mother; in fact, near the end 
of (he movie, we see a disheveled 
Nixon in Ihe auiumn of his poluical 
career, weeping (o his dead 
mother. 

The part of Nixon 
was played by 
Anthony Hopkins, 
who is sensational 
in his role as the 
controversial presi- 
dent. Hopkins, 
while nol physically 
resembling Nixon, 
employs (he gestures 
and manner of speak- 
ing for which the former 
president was famous. 
Hopkins maintains his spot as 
one of Ihe best aelors to appear on 
ihe silver screen. Without Sir 
Anthony. "Nixon" would have been 
a complete waste of an aflemoon. 

One could probably come up 
with a theory explaining why 
"Nixon" is so inferior to Slone' s 
previous work Maybe evil aliens 
invaded the body of the great film 
maker, causing irreparable brain 



damage to Stone Perhaps he has 
become a heavy drug abuser and 




"Nixon" was the product of an acid 
trip gone bad Hopefully he will 
check into a rehab facility before 
writing his next feature and save 
Ihe American moviegoer from the 
frustration of being subjected lo 
Oliver Slone(d). 



Follett's faces competition 



hy N"l Berkley 
Editor 

A new bookstore opened 
Monday to provide IPFW and IVY 
Tech sludenis with an off campus 
alternative location to buy hooks. 

Located in the North Anthony 
shopping plaza. "Off Campus 
Books" plans to slay competitive 
with Follett's Bookstore on campus, 
according to Manager Stacy Pcarce 

"We don'l want lo start a price 
war," Pcarce said But she added 
the siore will offer textbooks at a 
discount or the same price as 
Folleu's. Off Campus Books" 
President Karen Heller said the 
store will have the same textbooks 
as Follett's and will try to work 
closely wilh the university and pro- 
fessors lo continue to be of use to 
students 

Follett's manager Gary Brantley 
said he was not sure if the campus 



would he able support a second 
bookstore, but time would tell if a 
second store could succeed in this 
market 

"This campus may support 
another store ... 1 don'l really 
know what Ihe other slore's focus 
will be," said Brantley. He added he 
had never been to the store but said 
he hopes to fosler a good relation- 
ship with them. 

Heller said she started the store 
because she saw a large market at 
IPFW ihat could be assisted by 
another bookstore. "Being a siudent 
once myself, 1 saw a need to serve 
students." 

According lo Heller, her compa- 
ny will make a large push ai the end 
of the semesler lo buy back the stu- 
dents' books. "We had hoped to be 
open at die end of last semester but 
we were unable to." she said. 

The book store is in the process 
of setting up and will carry an 



inventory of around ten percent of 
what is needed For every subse- 
quent semester. Off Campus Books 
will carry a full stock of textbooks, 
according lo Pearce. The store will 
also feature the work of student 
artists and photographers on its 
walls and will be selling the artwork 
on a commission basis 

According lo BranUey, Follett's

by Janet Tobey 
SUIT Writer 

On Janet's Planet, the year is 
twelve months, but the seasons are 
different 

Spring lasts four months and 
summer is five glorious months. 
Fall lasts a colorful two months, 
and winter consists of only 
December Just enough time to get 
your ho ho no's, build a snowman, 
and go skiing. Then, on January 
first. Pow! It's bloomin' primavera 
again. 

Let's just say I am not a big fan 
of this weather. 

Ob sure, all of you Eskimos are 
saying, "Just get into the winter 
Absorb it, enjoy it." 

For me, it's not like that. All I 
absorb are too many carbohydrates, 
and all I enjoy is sleeping I turn 
into a big. fat, hibernating bear 

I don't sec how ya'll do it 
Winter, that is. 

During Christmas break I 
escaped the icy weather by going 
south. On my way back I, of course, 
headed right into a blizzard 

The Interstate signs said: South? 
This way. North? (you fool, you're 
heading into a snowstorm) Thai 
way Although it was against my 
natural instincts. I had to choose 
that way. because north is home I 
felt like a bird flying to Alaska for 
the winter 

It just don't make no kinda 
sense. 

It's really the driving on ice thai 
gets me. Maybe it's because I 
learned to drive in Texas, and didn't 
have to deal with the stuff until a 
couple of years ago, but it just terri- 
fies me. One big 16-wheeler could 
blow my lilUe Mazda off the road I 
can see it now Slick ice up ahead 
on the bridge, my white knuckles 
clenched desperately on the steering 
wheel, a huge truck passing me at 



high speed 

appears in my rear 
view mirror, 
lights out 

And what ls up 
with that black- 
frozen-sludgy 
snow caked next 
to my wheels'* I 
try to kick it off 
and am rewarded 
with a sprained 
toe I still kick the tires because I 
hate stuff 

It just seems that it would be 
preferable 10 live somewhere thai 
has a shorter ice age. er. winter. 

Think about it By October, 
we're already shivering. By 
January, our heating bills skyrocket, 
and daylight escapes us at 5:30. 
Winter sucks. And it will be with us 
until March, like a rude houscguest 
who doesn't know when to leave. 

It makes me wonder about the 
pioneers who settled here, back 




yCanet 



before central heat and electric 
blankets. What were they thinking? 
"This looks like a good spot..." 

Maybe it was summer when they 
arrived. Maybe the horses were 
Bred. 

As for me, I think I've had 
enough of the powdery white stuff

1868 The former military officer

the KKK

you look lo Vancouver and the

with the floor What kind of non- 
sense is that? The free-throw lane is 
now completely painted in. I have 
heard of a center playing in the

extreme The next addition to the 
floor is a paintcd-in three-point

here, I believe it is every m

money as be can, after all that is the 
American way. 

However, tilings have 

gotten way out of

Hip on the television 
and have a gander at 
the uniforms being 
worn by almost every 
NBA team Take one 
look at the floors 
upon which these 
players play (heir 
games. Only one 
word comes to mind 
and that is ugly There 
is no excuse for this 
nonsense Not so long 
ago it was only the 
foreign teams visiting 
our fine shores who 
wore such unsightly 
uniforms. Now, it 
seems as if it is the 
entire professional 

basketball league. 

If you have been 
away from the set for a while or 
simply cannot stand to watch pro 
basketball, let me fill you in. The 
pair of expansion teams- Toronto 
Raptors and Vancouver Grizzlics- 
as well as the likes of Chicago, 
Houston and Cleveland have turned

lo look like basketball uniforms. In

wonder if Hakeem

In the words of Apollo

It is a sad day in 
professional sports when 
team colors and logos 
are so incredibly ugly 
that as a fan you lose 
sight of the game, and 
concentrate instead on 
the uniforms and floor 
However, there is still 
some tradition remaining 
in the NBA. Despite the 
fact they moved to a big-

Women's basketball team stomps the competition 

Ranked #1 in region, #21 nationally

c had told head coach Pam Bowden prior 
id the start of the season bet team would be 12-0 over- 
all and 5-0 in the Greal Lakes Valley Conference, she 
probably would have called them crazy She probably 
would have laughed whole-heartedly 

"II is beyond my wildesi dreams." Bowden said. 

I In- women's basketball learn currently possesses an 
unblemished record Tbcy are winning games by an 
average of 18 points per game. According to Bowden, 
ii is the hard work, intensity and the altitude or the 
players that have bred such success. 

"We have played harder than anyone we have 
played." Bowden said. "I think we have worked harder 
and played a link bit smarter " 

A grcal ease can be made for ihe point Bowden pro- 
poses. 



Aside from a iwo-poini win over Bellarmine College 
during ihe holiday break, ihey have overwhelmed each 
of their opponents in ihe second half A 75-60 win over 
conference foe Lewis saw the 'Dons dominate the 
Flyers in ihe second half. Against Quincy ihe 
Mastodons wore out the hawks and pulled away in the 
second half lo pos! an 85-72 win. 

"The kids have bought into our system They each 
realize thai we have our roles and need to slay within 
thai realm These kids have done a phenomenal job," 
Bowden said. 

This success has gained a certain amount of respect 
for Ihe team. The latest USA-Today women's college 
basketball poll has II') W ranked at number 21 In 
Tuesday's regional ranking they hold the number 1 
spot. It is the i u ■- 1 lime in [he school's history thai the 
women's team has garnered such notoriety. And il 
docs not stop there 

"I think that we will jump significantly this week. 



(in the national poll)" Bowden said. "If we are ranked 
between 10 and 15. that is greal. 

The biggesi key to the learns success has been a 
change of attitude according lo Bowden. "The differ- 
ence between this year and last year is like nighl and 
day This year we are not scared lo lose. These kids 
want to win," Bowden said. 

And win they have. 

The learn embraces their success with open arms but 
with stressful ramifications 

"Ii is just as stressful when you are winning as when 
you are losing." Bowden said 

Although she is pleased with ihe early success of her 
team, Bowden still believes there are things thai need 
work. 

"1 am pleased with what we have done Our defense 
has improved bui I am a little disappointed in our 
rebounding," Bowden said 

Things may not gel much better from thai standpoint 



for some time 

Over ihe holiday break, post player Jennie Ncwbard 
went down with an injured knee The prognosis of her 
injury is noi positive and Bowden indicated Newhard 
will likely miss at least the next couple of games. 

"Obviously we do not want to lose a player like 
Jen." Bowden said. "However. I am confident we can 
pick up ihe pieces and make the necessary adjust- 



Huskers prove invincible 



In today's sordid 
story of college fool- 
ball with money hun- 
gry agents, coaches 
who may or may not 
return, and thirty- 
year-old players in 
their seventh year, we 
were blessed this year 
lo witness one of the 
grcatcsl national 
championship runs in 
college football histo- 
ry. With Nebraska's 
romp over Florida in 
the Fiesla Bowl, Ihe 
~~ Cornhuskcrs proved 
thai ihey indeed arc the kings of the hill 
Nebraska's run lo the championship actually 
began in the Orange Bowl last year against 
Miami, and then it appeared to be all down 




Lloy Ball to be honored 
Friday night 



by Spike Dcbaul 
Sports Reporter 

How many young men from 
Indiana would have turned down a 
scholarship offer from a basketball 
god named Bobby Knight Ii is 
probably fair to say few, if any. 
However, thai is exactly ihe deci- 
sion Lloy Ball made after gradua- 
tion from Woodland High School. 
Instead of packing his bags and 
going to Bloominglon to play bas- 
ketball for ihe Hoosicn&gt;, Ball ven- 
tured across (own lo play volley- 
ball for the Mastodons 

During his career on ihe court 
for Ihe Volleydons, Ball was 
selected All- American three con- 
secutive years In 1991 he was 
named the NCAA Freshman of 
the Year. He was also sclecicd as 
Ihe Midwcsl Intercollegiate 
Volleyball Conference most valu- 



hill from there lor the mighly Huskers. 

The experis agreed unanimously and 
incorrectly ihat after losing every starter from 
their offensive line last year. Nebraska was in 
for a long- road back to regaining their crown. 
Thai was put 10 rest early in the season when 
Nebraska weni ballistic on Oklahoma Siaie 
and Michigan State. Tailback Lawerence 
Phillips was leading the nation in rushing. 
and Tommie Frazier appeared lo be luming 
into a well-rounded quarterback. 

Nebraska's defense was once again atop the 
charts in many statistical categories and it 
seemed all was fine on the Husker machine 
And then the sneakers began to fall off mid- 
stnde, as Phillips and two other players were 
arrested. This would surely be the end of a 
great string of victories right? Come on, give 
me a break, this is tailback university, just 
bring in the fourth-string tailback After see- 
ing freshman Ahman Green lead the Huskers 
to victory 
against 
Colorado, it is 
easy lo see why 
Coach Tom 
Osborne was 
not loo con- 
cerned with let- 
ling- Phillips 
reium slowly. 

And so 
the sneakers 
were back on, 
laced up and 
running again 



as Kansas State, (with Ihe naiion's top 
defense at the lime) Oklahoma, and Kansas 
were laid to rest along Nebraska's champi- 
onship road Nebraska never lost that cham- 
pionship attitude needed to succeed because 
no team could take il from them. They sim- 
ply are the best learn in Ihe country until 
someone proves otherwise. Most importantly 
they beat teams the old-fashioned Nebraska 
way with a power running game and great 
defense. At the end of the road for the 
Comhuskers was one last hurdle. Ihe Florida 
Gators in the Fiesla Bowl. 

The Gaiors kept the game close for almosi 
a quarter And then for three quarters and 
four minutes the Huskers showed the country 



Comhuskers? They have gone 22-0 the last 
two years with Iwo national championships 
And while tbcy lose Frazier and probably 
Phillips this time they return all five offensive 
linemen, most of Iheir defense and their lead- 
ing rusher in Green. In addition, ihey are 
recruiting the nations top high school quarter- 
back, who coincidently is from Omaha. The 
teams stiffest challenge will come by playing 
in the new Big 12 conference against not only 
Colorado and the other powers from the Big 8 
but also Baylor, Texas and Texas A&amp;M. The 
big question that has lo be asked now is can 
the Huskers "three-peat?" Sure, why not? So 
remember, you beard it here first. Nebraska 
ill be the preseason number 1 in the Bowl 



what football was all about An enure team Coallition poll, steam roll through the Big 12, 



able player in 1993 and 1994. 

Ball holds three IPFW career 
records and is second on the 
NCAA's all-lime assist list with 
6.526 assists. He is fourth on the 
NCAA's all-lime |nt for aces with 
167 during his career. 

This summer Ball will play on 
the United Stales Men's 
Volleyball team at the Olympics. 
In fact, be will most likely be the 
team's starting setter 

In honor of Ball, bis achieve- 
ments and the records be set dur- 
ing his playing days for the 'Dons, 
the department of athletics has 
deemed Friday, Jan. 12, as Lloy 
Ball Night The festivities will 
accompany the Volleydons game 
against Manitoba beginning at 
7:30 p.m. Between games iwo and 
ihree, Larry Lee will introduce the 
newly named Lloy Ball athletic 
scholarship 



striving for the same goal, beating the odds of 
several experts around the nation, and giving 
the Gators what Florida Coach Steve Spurrier 
referred to as a good old-fashioned butt whip- 
ping Nebraska may not have necessarily had 
the betier team, 

or even belter ____ 

athletes, just the 
better game 
plan and a liitlc 
more heart. 
Nebraska taught 
us a valuable 
lesson, never 
discount the 
heart of a cham- 
pion. 

Why should 
we dismiss the 



and win their third slraight title. Proving lo 
most of the nation that until someone kicks 
them off their thrown, the Comhuskers are 
kings.

Q&amp; A 



Q. What's the point of 
HIV testing? If you've 
got HIV, you're going to 
die "before your time" 
and why would anyone 
want to know that? 

A. Medicines are now 
available that can prolong 
the period of good health 
and prevent illness in 
people with HIV Better 
treatments and possibly a 
cure may be found before 
those now infected get sick 
or die. Also. If you are 
infected, you must take 
precautions not to infect 
others
