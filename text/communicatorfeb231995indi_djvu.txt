Vice Chancellor of Acadamics leaving IPFW 



8yMelh«uY'&gt;unK-)-l&lt;'re&lt;i 
Chief Rtporlrr 

Effcciivc June, initrim Vice Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs Frederick Kirchhoff will leave IPFW lo become 
Dean of Ihe College of Liberal Arts ai Metropolitan 
UnlvCTSity in St. Paul, Minnciola. 

"It in a new comprehensive university and 1 will be 
Involved in developing new programs and hiring new 
faculty," Kirchhoff said. 

According lo Kirchhoff, he accepted ihc position 
rather than returning to his previous faculty status ai 
IPFW and "because of Ihc poienlial challenge and 
opportunily involved with this position." 



"My experience here has 
been m developing an urban com- 
muicr college," Kirchhoff said. He 
hopes that this experience will help 
him at his new position. 

The hunt for a pcrmancnl 
vice chancellor begins the final 
stages today when the first of five 
interviewees comes lo campus said 
the chairman of (he search and 
screen committee and SPEA direc- 
tor WjlhamLudwin. 
The position has not been stable for quite some time. 
Before Kirchhoff became interim vice chancellor. 




Wartell 



Michael Wariell, the cuncni chancellor, filled ihe posi- 
tion for a year. Both Ludwin and Kirchhoff hope that the 
new leader will remain ai IPFW on a long-term basis. 

"We're hoping to hire someone who is going lo come 
and stay for a while." Ludwin said. 

"I'd like to see someone who will bring long-term 
academic leadership," Kirchhoff said. 

According to Kirchhoff, the challenge of "working at 
a site where we are experiencing budgeting stress" has 
helped him grow. However, he admits that the need to 
resolve the problem is great. An almost 10 percent drop 
in enrollment is a major factor, he said. 

There will be many tasks to overcome for the future 
vice chancellor and Kirchhoff hopes that his predecessor 



will be able to cominuc improving the general studies 
program and "create a university atmosphere that values 
leaching more strongly." 

According to Ludwin, Ihc interviews for vice chan- 
cellor will continue through the week after spring. Once 
the fmal traveling arrangements for the candidates have 
been solidified, their names and qualiHcaiions will be 
released. He hopes to have all the plans arranged by this 
week. 

Once Ihe candidate has been selected, negotiations 
between Chancellor Warlcll and the candidate will 
begin. Ludwin says the new vice chancellor should lake 
office sometime in June: however, that dale is dependent 
on the negotiations. 



Alumni association 
discusses women's issues 



By Melis.sa Youn^-Florcs 
Chief Reporter 

Saturday. The American 
Association of University Women 
sponsored a panel discussion on 
issues pertaining to the work place. 
Five local cxpcris spoke on differ- 
enl aspects of the issue. 

IPFW interim director of Alumni 
Association Judy Gillman was one 
of the panelists. Her focus was on 
women in the workplace and the 
lack of en courage men I by adults for 
young women to pursue math and 
sciences. 

People are influenced in deci- 
sions about work by several factors; 
number one, they arc influenced by 
society's ideas about who should 
and shouldn't work, Gillman said, 
"Young women and men hear these 
messages. They're also influenced 



by other's expectations, other inter- 
ests, and their capabilities." she 
added, 

Gillman emphasized that 
women's wages in fields such as 
medicine and engineering are still 
proportionally disfigured, "...partly 
due lo the fact that men lend to bold 
higher paying jobs in each occupa- 
tion and typically earn more than 
women in the same Job," Gillman 
said. 

"Women are changing and in 
colleges and universities today it is 
enlightening to know that ihe young 
women are trying lo tune thai oui 
(the inequality), and they are mov- 
ing ahead," Gillman said. "Their 
aspirations are greater. The nice 
thing to know is thai they are 
achieving some of those goals." 
The need for more education and 
belter communication between 



employers and the educational sys- 
lem were also emphasized. 

"We need lo tie together more 
closely Ihe two faclions: employers 
and the educational system." Roger 
Hin. panelist and quality control 
consultant for GE, said. 

Hin emphasized thai there needs 
to be closer communication 
between the two groups in order to 
be more productive. According to 
Hirt, many students coming out of 
the system are not fully prepared 
for the work force. 

"Whai we really discovered is 
that work forces have lo be more 
highly educated and trained," Judy 
DeGanno, panelist and coordinator 
for the Three Rivers Literacy 
Alliance, said. "Jusi getting a high 
school degree is not enough any- 
more. People have lo be life-long 
learners."

edged Adkins' claim that Ihe refer- 
endum was an election and there-

we're willing 
to concede thai 
if the referen- 
dum was lo be 
run like the 
elections. , . . 
you only have a window of 72 
hours IQ contest an election." 
According to King. Adkins failed to 
meet these criteria. 

Adkins' aLso submilied a leiier to 




King 



the Judicial branch requesting 
ample time to formulate an argu- 
ment against the IPSGA's petition 
Adkins was unavailable to be 
reached for commenu 

Although the Judicial court bas 
not made an official decision 
regarding Adkins' original petition, 
they plan lo follow through with an 
investigation into the technology 
fee referendum. According to 
IPSGA Chief Justice Mall Van 
Ryn, the decision will be reached 
after Spring Break. 

IPSGA Justice Charles Copeland 
said, "We have not made a decision 
on Ihe merit of the original case."

By Melissa Young-Flores 
ChleT Reporter 

Monday. Feb. 27 from 12 to 1 
p.m., a Major Investigation of 
available degrees to undergraduates 
will be co-hosled by Career 
Services and Student Academic 
Counseling Services. "The main 
purpose is to provide information 
for people who are not sure what 
they want lo do," Laura Hcrbrand, 
associate director of Student 
Academic Counseling Services, 
said. 

Representatives from several 
different departments will set up 
camp in the Walb Union ballroom 
in order to provide "a one stop 
shopping siluaiion," according to 
Herbrand. Students will have the 



opponunity to speak with depan- 
menl representatives about GPA 
and course requirements and other 
degree related information. "We are 
hoping lo provide an opportunity to 
all IPFW students, and in particular 
undecided students, to meet with 
representatives of departments with 
degnws," Herbrand said. 

According to Herbrand, students 
will also be able lo sign up for a 
career assessment test as well as a 
discovery print out. The discovery 
prini-oul is four pages of informa- 
lion on a particular career. The 
information includes salary esti- 
mates, a list of the requirements for 
Ihc position, and the region where 
the majority of the positions are 
open. 



However those who have 
already selected a major but have 
yet to find their dream career may 
also find .some help. Several local 
universities and colleges have 
joined together with the Institute of 
Electrical and Electronic Engineers 
Professional Society to provide 
Career Expo '95. The event will

Doctor speaks to 
Black Collegian Caucus 



By Nol T. Beckley 
News Editor 

Doctor of Onocology Alan 
McGee inspired several students 
during a speech to the Black 
Collegian Caucus (BCC) on 
Monday. 

BCC President Yvcite Williams 
said, "What he said, really struck 
home with me." 

Chris Douse, special adviser to 
IPSGA president on mulitcultural 
affairs, said, "He really helped 
revitalize me in my quest on what 
I wanted to do with my career." 
Douse also called the speech 
"explosive." 

BCC. as pan of their continuing 
community involvement, invited 
McGce to speak about his experi- 
ences in Fort Wayne and how he 
adapted to college and profession- 
al life. "His mind is free," 
Williams said. 

Saturday, the BCC will host a 
Gospel Fesi which features Fort 
Wayne church choirs and the 
North Side High School Choir. 
Several soloists also will perform 
on Saturday, 

Proceeds from the Gospel Fesi 
will go to suppon the William and 
Cora Watson and the Levan Scott 
scholarships. The scholarship fund 
given through BCC is usually 
SlOO 10 S300. according to 
Williams. 

Williams said this academic 
year has been one of the most suc- 
cessful in BCC's history. Williams 
applauded the officers and other 
members' participation in BCC 



events. Williams also noted Ihc 
assistance of faculty advisers 
Marcia Tapp Sanders, interim 
director of multicultural services, 
and Tim Lake, adviser for African- 
American students. Assistant 
Director of Admissions. Cornelius 
Fullove, Coordinator of the 
Affiliate Staff Program. Anna 
Seiver, academic adviser Rhonda 
Meriwether and adviser for 
African-AmericaD students have 
also contributed to the success of 
the BCC, according lo Williams. 

The BCC exists primarily to 
suppon and "foster academic and 
social interaction among its mem- 
bers." BCC also works close with 
Ihe Fon Wayne community which 
allows its members to network 
among local professionals. The 
caucus supports students by tutor- 
ing sludcnls in need by someone 
within the organization, according 
to Williams. 

"We're trying to do little diings 
to gel BCC known and get mem- 
bership up," Williams said. If the 
membership increases Williams 
said she believes BCC will be 
even more active on campus. 

The BCC has bad several suc- 
cessful fundraisers this year, 
according to Williams. She said 
the credit card application table 
was one of more successful 
fundraisers. 

The BCC is "comprised of stu- 
dents who are concerned about 
their academic, cultural, social and 
community well-being." They 
exclude no one for race, gender, 
lineage or handicap.

with Ihe group (Caleb. Qilly and 
Mark) and ask probing quesljons 
about Ihe life and times of "Deadeye 
Dick," Dui being the easy-going guys 
that Ihcy arc, they graciously agreed 
to chal for awhile before Ihcir show. 

What we fniifnt were nol three 
guys thai were well on ihcir way to 



becoming arroganl stars. No, instead 
we found three laid-back, flirtatious 
buds who were as flattered to meet us 



as we were to meet Ihem. And thus 
began our interview with ihe guys 
from the Big Easy.

Many of you have probably heard 
their first song lo hit the airwaves, 
"New Age Girl" (it can also been 
heard in the film "Dumb and 
Dumber") which has a funky sound, 
nol lo mention the funky lyrics. Bui if 
you take the lime to listen to Ihe rest 
of the CD you would hear that it 
sounds nothing like thai song. 

In fact, Caleb. Ihe lead singer, con- 
curs with this thought, "That song 
New Age Girl") doesn'l represent 
Ihe band." 

The band is hard to label, bul 
when asked to label themselves ihey 
said they were "alternative power 
pop," "Nothing like "Mariah Carey' 
or "Nine Inch Nails,'" according to 
Billy. Ihe drammcr. This is apparent 
once you have seen Ihem in concert. 
Their sound is loud, fun and, power- 
ful. 

And it is also apparcni that iheir 
sound is attractive to all ages and all 
audiences. The group commented thai 
their audicrice ages range from sin to 
sinly, and ihey prefer it that way. At 



Iheir performance at Picasso's, k»cal- 
ed in the Piere's cnierUinmeni com- 
pIcK in the Marketplace of 
Canterbury, all ages were permilted 
lo attend and enjoy the concert. We 
applaud this idea because of the limit- 
ed aclivities for persons under the age 
of 21. Yel, some of Ihe older audi- 
ence members prefer the ability lo 
drink and enjoy the show, 

Wendy Siroc. a senior at IPRV 
majoring in marketing and manage- 
ment. agrees. "[The younger crowd] 
is good for Ihe band but I'd rather be 
surrounded by an older crowd." com- 
mented Siroe. 

The band is as young as the crowd 
because the band has nol been around 
for long. About two years ago Billy, 
Mark and Caleb formed Ihc band that 



we know today as "Deadeye Dick." 
Within ihree weeks ihe band wa» 
working on their debut album. "A 
Different Slory." And Ihey have been 
louring since day one. 

E\-en though Ihe band's succe.ts ii 
rising, they siill prefer a smaller 
venue like Picasso's in Fori Wayne, 
for example, than performing in 
Chicago or Indianapolis. 

"Small towns appreciate us more," 
explained Caleb. 

They are currcnlly working on 
Ihcir second album and they arc slill 
louring lo support Ihcir first. And 
don't be so surprised if they travel 
this way again some day soon. And 
don't miss this band for the second 



"A Different Story:" 
A review of Paiid@y© 



:*@ debut CD 



Paul Tuppcr 
Features Writer and 
Kara WUtlng 
Features Editor 

What kind of band name is 
Deadeye Dick? Wc suppose we could 
second guess this, bul instead we will 
just review the bands firsi disc "A 
Different Story," now in record stores 
from Ichiban Records. 

If you arc expecting a CD that 
resembles ihe sound of "New Age 
Girl." think again. This firsl single is 
not a true signature of Ihc band's 
sound. Who would of thought that a 
band would have some serious songs 
about death or jilted love when "New 
Age Girl" has lines like, "Oh she 
loves me so. she hates lo be 



alone/She don't i 

likes the bone." 

But Deadeyi 



deceased Margucdie Heurtin, a long 
lime friend of lead singer and song 
Caleb Guilloiie. 




other grange-like groups. 

This first album geis beiler the 
more you hsicn to it. And when you 
sec Ihe band live, you come back 
wanting lo listen to il even more, "A 
Different Story" is a fine effort that 
shows a lot of promise for Ihe future. 
But don't wait for Ihc future works of 
Deadeye Dick; get this CD if you 
enjoy variety in your music. 

Since wc had the opporiuniiy to 
see Ihe band live and listen lo their 
CD. we give this unique-sounding 
band from New Orleans nine out of a 
possible ten.

...and out the Other 




Weslerrield played ibe role of Mana 
Theresa/ Sr. Maiy Gennaioc. 

The role of Colleen was interesting 
because ber spunk added to die devel- 
opmenl of the plot. Forbing's other 
cbaiacier. Sr. Mary Lgeile. was not 
what one would call a nice nun. Sr. 
Mary Lucile was a mean and nasiy 
nun who was always right, and 
Elizabeth (Heidi Warfel) was out lo 
prove her wrong. 

This is the part of the sioty ihal is 
so interesting. Elizabeth questions if 
God was a Jew. When EII^abelh raises 
this queslion at a young age, she con- 



Lnues 10 search for all of ber child- 
hood for the answer despite the obvi- 
ous disapproval of Sr. Lucile. 

The other characters develop 
around each other with inlerciiing sto- 
ries and mannerisms- Sr Mary 
Thomesina was a funny character 
because she was ncrdy and allergic to 
evcryihing. Sr. Mary Germaine was 
well-played by Gail Weslerfield 
because she captured the true essence 
of a "tough" nun. 

One of the funnier characters was 
Sr- Mary Agnes, played by Susan 
Szadkowski. Szadkowski's portrayal 



of [hit character remmdcd me of my 
first grade leachci, oblivious lo every- 
thing around her. 

The direciiOD itself was great 
because the musical inteiuptions were 
perfect and calculated in thai Ihe musi- 
cal selections were from thai lime 
period and really captured the 
mom en I- 

But Ibis review would noi be com- 
plete without making a comment on 
Ihe lip sine of "Slop in Ihe Nome of 
Love" by the Supreme!. 1 could not 
slop laughing. If you saw this, you 
would understand But if you by 



&gt;t sec it. then ki mc put it 
lo you like ibisr four Catholic school 
girls in their plain uniforms fighting 
for the spodigbl with pig tills lip sinc- 
ing to the Supremes. 1 guns you bad 
lo be ibere. but nonetheless, it wu 

I really enjoyed this play if not just 
for the story, but also for the greal 
direction by Greg Siiebcr and ihc great 
character adaptations by the actiesic*. 

If a rating must be given, than I 
give "Catholic School Girls" four stars 
out of a possible four. 



The Silver Screen Review: 

'*B€ys on me siae'* 




KaraWhlUng 
Features Editor 

Ah. yes. another film review. This 
week "Boys on Ihe Side" will be the 
fealurc film. This film starring 
Whoopi Goldberg, Drew Barrymore 
and Mory-Louise Parker is a truly 
unique film in its own way. 

Tlic tluec wonKn (Robin. Jane and 
Annie) start oui wilh an innocent 
drive out west lo search for new lives. 
The three women really know each 
other c;&lt;ccpl Jane (Whoopi Goldberg) 



and Annie (Drew Banymore). But, 
nonetheless, the three of Ihem forge 
westward in a Ford Windstar. They 
don't make it to California like ihey 
eupcctcd because ihey run into a lillle 
problem in Tuscan, Arizona. 

AH three of these characters have 
very different problems and yet. they 
are problems which effect our society 
today. These characters face prob- 
lems such as pregnancy oul of wed- 
lock, being a lesbian in the nineties 
and AIDS viciims. 



though Ihe Robin's siory. (she has 
AIDS) was depressing, but the movie 
was noi about Ihe problems Ihal these 
three women have. The film is more 
about how the women deal wilh the 
pain and Ihe laughter and Ihc tears 
and the bonds that are formed 
between women. The focus of Ihe 
movie was well directed and appreci- 
ated by this viewer. 

The three characters all have 
something to overcome and when you 
sec this film you will understand why 
their friendship is more important 



than any of their prohlcms- 

Tbe film will not only open your 
heart, but will also open your ear to 
Ihe greal music. In one scene there is 
a special appearance by a duo lhat 
mosi people like. "Indigo Girls." Yes. 
they appeared in this movie and 
crooned souk tunes which reach the 



dcpthsof our souli. 

I strongly recommend this nwvic 
10 any woman. Go sec it with Ihal 
close friend, or even your mom. You 
won't regret it at all. llils film gets 
three-and-a-half junior mints out of a 
possible four.

Don't fire aging adults ^ 



Recently the IPFW adminisint- 
ttoa did not renew the conimcu of 
one or more employees. According 
to Jane Stiva, former assistant 
director of development, most of 
Itae people thai were not a.slccd lo 
return were women over the age of 
fifty. 

U the university discriininating 
against older employees, specifical- 
ly women, and if so, why? No one 
in the administration is going to 
admit that they Tired an employee 
because they were ton old. That 
would be age discriminaiion. and 
age discrimination is against tlic 
law. 

When Frank Borelli. vice chan- 
cellor of student affairs and 
Michael Wancll. IPFW chancellor, 
were asked lo comment on this uni- 
versity's employment policy. Uiey 
would not. They could not, because 
age discriminaiion is against the 
law. If they have a policy of not hir- 
ing older adults or not renewing 
their contracLs, they arc definitely 
not going to tell a newspaper 
reporter about it. They would be 
selling themselves up for a hefty 
lawsuit. 

The reason that age discrimina- 
tion is against the law is because 
many employers don't want to hire 
older adults. 

At what age do people stop 
being valuable sources of informa- 
tion? If employers' hiring and firing 
practices are a measure, the age is 
about 55, After this age it is almost 
impossible to Hnd employmenL It 
is also at this age that employees 
Stan worrying about their jobs, 
especially if their company is cut- 



Comnientary 



You do the math 



February is Black History 
Month. I think it is very sad when 
we as a people only reserve one 
month out of the year lo pay 
homage lo a people who were 
enslaved by 




Those "while folk" who whine 
about how there is no "White 
History month" should realize that 
much of our history is white histo- 
ry with a few token references lo 
Martin Luther King Jr., W.E.B. 
DuBois and George Washington 
Carver. Even biblical history has a 
white slant to it; Jesus was not 
white and the apostles were not 
while either. Look it up in Isaiah. 

The account of the Civil War 
that most children learn in school 
is also skewed- We are led to 
believe that the North fought a 
"holy war" to free the downtrod- 
den "Negro" slaves. This was not 
Ihe case. Slavery gave Lincoln the 
cause he needed to make the war a 
moral battle rather than just a fight 
over stale's rights. 

I do not feel guilty because 1 
am a while male. No one should. 
"White folk" should not feel 
guilty for being white, however, 
Ihey can not deny the fact that an 
enormous atrocity to the human 
race was committed. Five million 
humans were kidnapped from 



their society and forced to live in 
oppression of one form or another 
for 400 years. 

Of the five million who were 
kidnapped, only one million 
Africans lived through the voyage 
from Africa to America (the home 
of the free?). Sharks used lo fol- 
low the slave ships because they 
knew where the food was. When 
the slave ships arrived in Ihe 
colonies the blacks were robbed of 
their heritage, their honor and 
their self respect. They were treat- 
ed like animals. Even the founding 
fathers did not recognize African 
Americans as complete human 
beings. Section Two of the 
Constitution stales that people 
who are "bound to service" (i.e. 
slaves) will only be counted as 
three-fifths of a person. 

You may say the Constitution 
was written 210 years ago and 
what does that have lo do with the 
price of cotton: however, that 
mentality still pervades American 
society. Only last week. 
Mississippi's House of Legislature 
finally passed the 13th 
Amendment which outlawed slav- 
ery. 1 also believe welfare is a 
form of modem day slavery. The 
biggest threat slave owners had 
over slaves was separating the 
family. For children to receive 
welfare, the father must not live in 
Ihe same household - where are 
Ihe family values in that? 

With 400 years worth of 
oppression to be solved one month 
(the shortest month) per year it 
would take approximately . . . ahh 
forget it; you do the math! 

Opinions in this column do not 
necessarily represent Ihe opinons ol 
The Communicator. 





ting back. 

If people are no longer useful 
employees after this age. then why 
has .ilmosi every single president of 
the United States been over this 
age? If we did not have confidence 
in the abilities of older individuals 
then we wouldn't voie them into 
office. 

Since ihc citizens of this country 
obviously do have faiib in older 
adult's abilities, why don't employ- 
ers? Perhaps it Ls not their abilities 
that arc being called inio question. 
Perhaps employers have other rea- 
sons to hire and fire as they do. 

One impetus for firing an older 
employee is the cost of health care 
benefits. As many older adults 
know, the cost of health care rises 
wiih age. 

Another reason employers might 
fire an older employee is because it 
would reduce the amount of retire- 
ment benefits the employer must 
pay. 

Finally, employers might just be 
following an outdated policy. If this 
is the case they need to take a close 
look at the reasons for this policy 
and see if they are still valid. 

As life expectancies increase, so 
do the number of people over the 
age of 55. Employers need to real- 
ize this They also need to realize 
that tliese people are still able, func- 
tioning members of society, and 
should adjust their hiring and firing 
practicesaccordingly. 

Change has to stan somewhere. 
Perhaps this administration should 
look at the ages of some of its stu- 
dents and change its hiring prac- 
tices acconJingly. 



^or ^ifc: To Koov Mm Proivii^^" 



For my dear friend Erik's pain 
I write this to let you know I believe, 
And I know you aren't going Ir^sane. 
You're my friend and always shall be. 

Do you really see me as I am? 

Do you think you really l&lt;now me? 

See through my shell 'cause there's a man 

Who only wishes to be set free. 

False appearances. Endless pain. 
I have to face it every damn day. 
The soul and body aren't the same. 
Why do I have to live this way? 




They say eyes are windows to the soul, 
So, look In mine. Tell me what you see. 
fvloma, take the time to see my soul 
'Cause he's there, chained inside me. 

Release these chains that tie me down. 
Let my restless spirit free. 
Break chains! Snap with quaking sound. 
No tiesi i?evlve and release me!

Racial perspective 
skews interpretation 
of God's actions 



Last Thursday, Tim Lake, 
adviser for African-American 
students, discussed racial oppres- 
sion and God's role in black- 
while race relations in this coun- 
try. According to Lake, this is the 
fourth century that whiles have 
oppressed the black segment of 
American society.

try or his stance thai the black 
community has been oppressed 
for 400 years. I am also willing 
to leave the subject of God's 
exisl£;fice untouched. 

I do have a problem with 
some of his resulting theological 
conclusions. Labeling God as 
unjust because He ha.sn't imme- 
diately eradicated Ihc human 
injustices on this planet is akin to 
saying the police don't care 
about fighting crime because 
someone successfully robbed an 
irmer-city bank. 

Lake said he has been taught 
to lay God on the examining 
table. This is illogical. If we 
believe in God and that he is all- 
powerful and all-knowing, the 
positions need to be reversed. We 
need to place ourselves on God's 
examining table. Who are we to 
place God on our table? 

It is very convenient for us to 
make God the subject of our 
examination instead of allowing 
ourselves to be scrutinized by 
Him. By doing this we can 
shape Him to our liking. 

Lake kept telling the audience 
to put God on the examining 
table, yet if we do this and come 
to the wrong conclusions then the 
price we pay is massive. 

Self-defining God logically 
leads to self-defining His

motives. Lake touched on this 
when he said God was blind to 
the plight of black people in this 
country. 

The average man lives 70 
years. If God is God by defini- 
tion, He has lived longer than 
any of us. Therefore, He operates 
on a larger time scale than men 
do. 

The shortest present lifespan 
of humanity is given by Judeo- 
Chrislianity: between 6,(K)0 and 
20,000 years. Anyone who 
believes in both evolution and 
the existence of God will recog- 
nize an even longer timetable. 
God's lime scale.' at least where 
He deals with humanity, is then 
as long as the existence of 
humanity. 

This is an important point 
because anyone who claims God 
is silent to suffering (because He 
allows it to continue) disregards 
the inherent differences between 
how man and God can operate. 

In the past, He has allowed 
masses of people to suffer for 
extended periods of time. When I 
meniioned the Egyptians' slavery 
of the Jews before the Jews took 
possession of Canaan. Lake sim- 
ply said, "The enormity of 
African-American suffering is so 
pervasive and so wrenching thai 
it's hard for you to take a ... lon- 
gitudinal historical view as far as 
the beginning of mankind." 

Is African- American suffering 
more wrenching than the killing 
of six million Jews during World 
War II or human suffering under 
the communists? 

God sometimes permits one 
group to abuse another for a peri- 
od of time to allow the abuser(s) 
to realize their error and (dare I 
say it?) repent This is where His 
forgiveness comes into play, an 
attribute of God many liberal the- 
ologians would be quick to note 
in any other discussion. 

Lake does well to tell of his 
academic study of God. He does 
one better when he mentions God 
must be a personal experience. 
When people attempt to define 
God merely in books and the 
classroom, they reduce Him to 
another facet of human life, 
instead of the all-powerful being 
iheisls believe He is. 

The attempt to determine, by a 
small segment of history, either 
God's ability or willingness to 
intervene in human affairs is lo 
limit His capacity to intervene 
and reduce His usefulness to 
humanity to another option 
among many.

Inhale, exhale. Inhale, exhale. 

Let me explain, 1 am trying to 
calm down. I am mad and it takes 
this Hide exercise for me to cool 
off 1 am about to do something 
that I try hard not to do. 1 am 
going to comment on a conversa- 
tion that occurred in one of my 
lasses loday. 




great. If you are an avid reader of 
mine, you know that 1 think that 
communication is the key to life. 
No matter what you do. if you 
cannot, or do not communicate, 
Ihen you are not going lo get very 
far in your own personal growth. 
So this class is a favorite of mine. 

The topic of discussion was on 
sex roles and the neetl for them. 
Jeanne Barone, die class profes-sor 
and IPPrV's greatest asset, posed 
the question, "What would it cost 
you and the culture if our tradi- 
tional definition of male and 
female became blurredT' Firsl. we 
were asked to list the cost, or com- 
promises it would need lo achieve 
this goal. Then we were asked to 
list the benefits. Obvious things 
like job equality for both women 
and minorities, freedom and toler- 
ance. What got me mad was a 
comment from one of the men in 
this class. He said only the women 
would benefit from such a change 
in society. Now, 1 am not sure as 
to what makes me more mad, the 
implication that co-cultures such 
as gays and minoriues would nol 
benefit, or the de-valuing the man 
has done to the question. By say- 
ing that only women could benefit 
from equal gender roles, be is say- 
ing that men would care less about 
the mission of equality, so their 
effort would be minimal. 

Before I go on. let me explain 
thai we are talking about feminini- 
ty and masculinity and societies 
insistence on judging people who 
don't fit their gender role stereo- 
type. This ideology would mean 



nol hara.ssing the men who stay 
home and take care of Ihe chil- 
dren, not referring to women who 
are aggressive and business sman 
as bitches and not picking on the 
men who would rather lislcn to 
Mozart tlmii McLillica. 

Men like the role of king in this 
country. I, not being a women, 
may not be Ihe best person to go 
into to thus, but I don't believe that 
women are trying to dethrone 
men. I diink women want lo join 
the men on the throne. It is not 
their goal to take over, hut to sim- 
ply help and have their ideas heard 
and applied to the arguments of 
life. This should not he a world in 
which men make all die decisions 
and women must adhere to them; 
women need to be in the drawing 
room as well. This is slowly hap- 
pening, but unless we can dimin- 
ish the lihcs between gender roles, 
then it is not going to happen. 

TTie same is tme for homoseiu- 
als. Until society gets over its 
thinking that masculine women 
and feminine men are misfits of 
nature, then we are nol going lo 
have the benefits of gender role 
assimilation. That in itself is an 
insult, because in the discrimina- 
tion against homosexuals, die big- 
oted are assuming that every gay 
man and lesbian do not fit soci- 
ety's gender role stereotype. Truth 
is, many gay men are very mascu- 
line and many lesbians arc very 
feminine. But don't fry explaining 
that to people who insist on 
believing thai we gay men all 
paint our toenaifs, and every les- 
bian drives a Peterbuilt for rcCTC- 
ation. 

What really bugs me is how 
wrong 1 have been. 1 thought that 
people like this "poet" in my class 
bad been banished. Come to find 
out that we still live with these 
small-minded people who think 
people like me. or anyone else 
who uses their voice for change, 
are whining about life's little mis- 
givings. If only diey would listen 
to what all of us are saying, maybe 
we wouldn't think they were so 
small minded. 

But until then,

Have you ever joined a club or

taaven'l I have a loi or (rouble 
believing thai the 1 1,000 people on 
this campus are Ihal apaihciic.

There arc isiudcni groups all over

There arc 69 chibs and organisa-

off your butt and join some, or ai 
least one, quit whining!!! I can't 
think of a single group that would 
not welcome you to Ibeir meetings. 

They arc there. All you have to 
do is look. There is at lea.si one for

would be over 160 members in each 
group. J know that the office of The

had a little help. 

I am not pleading with you to

An open letter to the disgruntled 
black ciiiz£ns of my country 

I am aware that many of you 
hold serious grievances towards 
the while people of this nation for 
their racist altitudes and actions, 
both past and present. You charge 
white people with heinous crimes. 
and demand reparation for them. 
Due 10 the fact that my skin is 
white, you have implicated me in 
your charges. Is it because of such 
false and serious charges against 
my character that I now feel com- 
pelled to defend myself? 

I have examined your claims 
and fmd much substance lo them. 
In the past, some white people of 
this country did indeed commit 
very serious "crimes against 
humanity," perpetrated against 
many black people. According lo 
the laws of justice, the wrongdoers 



should be punished and forced to 
make reparations to those who 
were wronged. But since slavery is 
now dead, this is impossible. 

In light of this fact, you seem to 
conclude that since we (the white 
people) arc descendants of the 
criminals, while you (the black 
people) are descendants of the vic- 
tims, thai we should therefore 
make reparations lo you. Here. I 
fmd a serious fault with your argu- 
ment. I am not a direct benefactor 
of the profits of slavery. I was not 
bom rich- My family did not make 
their living as parasites, living ofl" 
the work of other people. Rather. 
they, as I do, also worked long and 
bard hours to make a living. 

Another element to consider is 
the fact thai black people in our 
past have enjoyed varying degrees 
of freedom, even during the dmes 



of legalized slavery. Some black 
families have surely bom a greater 
burden than others from the effects 
of these social injustices. To me, 
your messages often comes across 
that all while people, including 
me. should make a cash payment 
to every cilisen who b black. This 
comprehensive demand fails to 
equitably distribute varying 
degrees of fault or allow for vari- 
ous levels of compensation. 
Because of this. I say that 1 am 
neither a perpetrator, nor a bene- 
factor of racism, and that I owe 
you nothing more than the com- 
mon decency and respect which I 
afford all people. 

This letter is intended to clear 
my name of any guilt thai might be 
implied by your claims. Il is not 
intended to declare that no while 
persons are guilty and it is not 



intended to take legitimacy away 
from any person's demands tor 
compensation. If you u\j!y seek to 
make your lives bciicr through 
effecting political change, I sug- 
gest you pay more ancntion lo the 
details of your charges. By naming 
an entire race as plaintiffs in your 
suit, you will surely be labeling 
yourselves as racists, thus hurling 
your own legitimacy. 

1 realize this letter does not 
cover the entire spectrum of issues 
regarding racism. 1 am attempting 
to open a dialogue. I believe 
racism is a serious issue which 
adversely affects all citizens of this 
country, and 1 would welcome and 
appreciate any comments reg-ird- 
ing these issues from blacks, 
whites or any other persons.

African Americans: knowledge of past can help improve future 



ByShizzMan 
Guest Columnlsl 

"Gather (gaih'er) vt - to bring 
together in one place or group . 
Round (round) adj- full; complete" 
fWebslcr's Dictionary), The signifi- 
cance of the title as il relates to this 
article is to emphasize dial A£ican 
Americans can be complete within 
American society if we can come 
together to form a .strong alliance. 
I'm saying that African Americans 
unite in order lo enhance all ihe 
resources and talents at our dispos- 
al. 

In order lo discuss the topic of 
African-American unity, the ele- 
menls that disunite us as African 
Americans, must ftfsi be discussed. 
When I use die word "disunite." 1 
am speaking in terms of the internal 
forces that separate us. It is impor- 
tant thai African -American individ- 
uals sicp out pt.die cycle, of disunity 
ih order lo examine the siluadon wc 
are in. 

First, the pursuit of the 
"almighty dollar" disunites African 
Americans. Within American soci- 
ciy, any individual's success is 
based on monetary gains, any indi- 
vidual is considered lo be success- 
ful if that individual lives in a large, 
beautiful house, and drives an 
expensive aa. Second, lack of sup- 
port for one another disunites 
African Americans. Instead of 
wishing our brothers and sisters 
good will, many Africiin Amencans 
wish their brothers and sisters to 
falter. The Hnal and mosi signifi- 
cant category that disunites Afncan 
Americans is assimilation Manv 
African Americans have convinced 
themselves dial in order to be sue 
ccssful in America they musi lake 
on the attributes of the Caucasians 
meaning many African Amentans 
have lost their sense of African 
identity. 

I will now offer a few goals that 
African Americans must obtain in 
order lo unify. 1 believe that I am 
echoing some solutions that have 
been expn^ssed by olhcr individuals 
throughout history. 1 will be adding 
my own personal insight to these 
proposed solutions. 

First, an improved educational 
system must be formed. The educa- 
tional system in America is turning 
African Americans into a perma- 
nent sub-class. The American edu- 
cational system guides an African- 
American individual towards skills 
that are based on manual labor. 
African Americans arc not educat- 
ed; wc are laughi or trained. 
Remember, brothers and sisters, an 
animal can be taught or trained, 
only humans can be educated The 
American educational system does 
not want us to utilize out mielleci. If 
we succeed in the American educa- 
tional system, the belief that 
African Americans an: intellectual- 
ly inferior will then be desiro&gt;'ed. 
Thus. African Americans must be 
perceived to be intellectually paral- 
lel 10 any other ethnic group. 

Second, knowledge of our histo- 
ry can benefit our migration 
towards unity, African Americans 
do not learn about the sigaificant 
contributions that their ancestors 
made lowanls world history. Many 
of our important ancestors are 



depicted as being Caucasians, such 
as Cleopatra. Once African 
Americans arc educated about their 
history, they can begin to unlock 
the shackles of mental slavery. We, 
as African Americans, will then 
destroy the inferiority complex that 
American society tries to instill 
within us. We must recapture our 
heritage and our identity if we are 
ever to free ourselves from the 
bonds of mental slavery. We must 
initiate a cultural revolution to 
unbrainwash and deprogram an 
entire race of people. 

Third, having love for oui fellow 
brothers and sisters will help unite 
African Americans, I beheve dial I 
can only grow as an individual if all 
of my brothers and sisters grow as 
well. 

Instead of loving one another, some 
of us Uy to harm one another. We, 
as African Americans, all have one 



bond From the darkest of 
complexions, to the lightest of com- 
plexions, we all have African blood 
flowing through our veins. It is not 
so hard to love your brothers and 
sisters once you comprehend that 
we are all related by blood. Thus. 
you may noi wish lo do harm lo 
someone you believe you are relat- 
ed to. 

Fourth, the formation of a soci- 
ety in which monetary gains is not 
essential, may unite African 
Americans. I believe success of any 
individual should be based on what 
that individual does for the "uplift- 
ment" of his brothers and sisters, 
whedier it be financially, emotion- 
ally, mentally or physically. I al.so 
believe success of any individual 
should be based on assisting society 
cure some of the ills of racism. If a 
racist idealogy is destroyed, then we 
can all view each other as equals.

In conclusion, I wUI analyze and 
conneci the four proposed solutions. 
If African Americans succeed in a 
fair educational system, they will 
then value themselves as being 
intellectually equal, they will then 
understand that their ancestors were 
just as intellectually capable as the 
Caucasians' ancestors, thus giving 
African Americans a sense of 
African identity. If we combine all 
the aforementioned solutions within 
a society that feeds off helping one 
another, the outcome will be total 
societal unity. Let's take time out to 
address this issue and begin produc- 
tive dialogue. 

As the end of this millennium 
approaches and a new one begins, 
human society should begin to con- 
template racial reforms. World- 
wide harmony should be the goal of 
the human society. In order to 
achieve global harmony, African 



sion and understanding. Peace, love 
and unity. 



Americans must first be harmo- 
nious. After African Americans 
unite then they can unite with their 
African relatives. After total 
African unity is obtained dien we 
may begin to interact with other 
cultures and nationalities in order to opinions in this column do not 
achieve total global harmony. May necessarily rapresenl Ihe opinions 
God increase us all in love, compas- ol The Cammunicator.

VoUeydons take a step forward 

Coach likes improved serving, juggled lineup 



By S. Brant KcHcy 
Fxliinf -in-Chief 

Aflcr George Mason 
Univcnily's first men's volleyball 
maich with IPFW. GMU coach 
Ron .Shayka said by the end of ihc 
season be pmbably would not rec- 
ognize any of the teams which 
played in the Fon Wayne National 
Dank/Pepsi Invitational at the 
beginning of the season. IPFW 
coach Amic B;ill hopes be is righi. 

Ttie VoUeydons may have uJcen 
a step in the direcUon Shayka had 
predicted when playing in the 
Lewis University East-Midwest 
Challenge tournament la,st week- 
end. 

II'BV reiunicd from the tourna- 
ment with one win and two losses 
to show for their efforts, but they 
slgiiineanlly reduced their service 
errors in all three matches, which 
is one of the two things Ball has 
emphasized up to this poini 

Said Ball. "Our serving (for die 
loufDaraeni) was considerably bet- 
ter." 

On Friday night, GMU defeated 
JPFW for the third time this sea- 
son, The VoUeydons recorded 10 
service aces, dircc each by Ricardo 
Solcr and Mike Ter Molen. to go 
with only 11 service errors. Ball 
said any ratio of aces to errors 
above one to two is good. 

'I'Jic Patriots killed 36 percent of 
dieir altempLs successfully and dug 
53 spikes on defense to win the 
match. 15-9. 6-15. 15-10. 15-12. 
and improve their record lo 11-0. 
IPFW dropped lo 5-6. 

Mike Mauro led GMU's attack 
with 27 kills, while teammate Janis 



Tupesis added 22 kilLs with a .606 
kill percentage. 

Felipe Ralat had 19 kills and 
Soler added 17 for IPfTV. Justin 
Luna, at only six feet, one inch, 
added 12 kills. The VoUeydons 
registered a .267 kill percentage. 

The VoUeydons spiked Long 
Island University-Southampton 
fLlU-S). 11-15. 15-5. 15-10. 15-1 
on Saturday morning to even their 
record at 6-6, 

Soler started at setter in place of 
Scott Lauer and George lakavoy 
regained his starting role, replacing 
Felipe Ralat as a middle bitter. 
Ralat moved into Soler's spot on 
the outside. 

"I haven't been pleased with 
our team chemistry, and I'm look- 
ing fur something better." Ball 
explained concerning the change. 

Dall added he thought Solcr 
performed capably as the team's 
setter. "With the limited time he 
had ...(as the setter), he did a very 
nice job,"he said. 

Ball used Lauer as a serving 
substitute during the match. "We 
used him as a serving 
specialist. ..He has a real good 
jump serve," he said. 

IPFW had seven service aces to 
go with only nine errors for the 
match. 

Juslin Luna led die VoUeydons 
with 20 kills, David Wilhoit and 
Jon Huffman added 16 and 14 
kills, respectively as Ihe team 
■recorded a .356 kill elficiency, 

Mike Salak had 20 kills to pace 
The Colonels. No other LIU-S 
player had more than 12 kilts and 
die team killed at only a 15 percent 
clip. 



In Saturday night's match. Penn 
State University beat the 
VoUeydons, for the second time 
this year, in four games, 15-8, 3- 
15.15-8.15-9. 

The loss dropped IPFW to 6-7 
for the season. Five of diose losses 
have come against either PSU or 
GMU. PSU improved to 12-5, 

Ivan Cetreras led the Nittany 
Lions with 19 kills. Ed Josefoski 
added 17 with a .467 kill percent- 
age and Fred Masteis had 14 kills

respectively. IPF\V rv'corded a 28 1 
kill efficiency. 

Ball said he was pleased widi 
the team's newfound serving con- 
sistency, but the VoUeydons still 
needed to improve its passing. 

"Passing certainly was a factor, 
we moved Felipe to the outside. 
When we moved Ricci to the set- 
ter, it left us void to die outside." 
Ball said in evaluating his team's 
passing and explaining some line- 
up changes for the tournament. 

Saturday night, the VoUeydons 
host Ohio State University 
(OSU) at the Gates Cemer at 7:30 
p.m. 

At die beginning of the season. 
Ball projected OSU would do well 
in the MIVA. "They have Jose 
Bengoa back, and be is probably 
the best pure passer in the league." 
be said. Bengoa, an outside hitter. 
was injured for the Tu^t several of 
the Buckeye's matches.

Mastodons sweep Lewis 



UyS.BranlKeUty 
Editur-tn-Chkr 

A team widi one junior and one 
senior usually does not rebound 
from two losses hy a combined 61 
points, and tbe same team also usu- 
ally does not out-score a more 
experienced team 12-4 in the last 
Uirec ininules. 

However. Tbe IPFNV Mastodons 
played out of die young team mold 
last Thursday lo beat Lewis 
University (LU), 84-73. in front of 



550 fans at die Gates Center. They 
did rebound from their two previous 
losses, literally. 

"Last Saturday, we just were 
horrible in every phase," said IPFW 
coach Andy Piazza. "The coaching 
staff didn't sugar-coat dial ai all; 
diey responded. Of course. I think 
good kids always respond to adver- 
sity, and I think we (have) some 
pretty good kids." 

Having been out-rebounded in 
their previous game against 
Northern Kentucky University by 



15, the Mastodons pounded the 
Flyers on the boards. 33-24, and 
shot 55 percent from the field lo 
give IPFNV coach Andy Piazza his 
200th career college win. 

The Lady 'Dons were only 
sUghUy less impressive in their vic- 
tory earlier, recording a 95-66 past- 
ing of die Lady Flyers. 

IPFW led by eleven. 42-31, at 
half-time, then went on a 26-1 1 tear 
over eight minutes in the second

line. We needed to stay on her but 
we just didn't take care of it." 
Rnwilpn •iaid 
Bowden said. 

Bowden added, "We played a 
much better game this time against 
Saini Joseph. We took a ten-point 
lead but made some critical mistakes 
at the end of die game and lost it. 
Pan of the problem was inexperi- 
ence, that part of the team wasn't 
ready to play and we weren't diere 
defensively," 

Lindy Jones led the scoring for

Former 
Replacements 
guitarist dies 
in Minneapolis 

By Nol T. Becklej 
News Editor 

On Saturday. Bob Stinson 35, 
former lead guitarist for Ihe 
Replacements was discovered dead 
in his Minneapolis apanmeni. 

Stinson was kicked out of the 
band in 1986 afier the 'Mats first 
major label release. Reportedly, 
S I i n s on ' s 




Stinson 



attempt to 
become sober. 
After his first 
release from 
detox, Stinson was playing a 
with the 'Mats, when froniman Paul 
Westerberg handed Stinson a boiile 
and said. 'Take a drink or gel of my 

slageM F !!" 

Stinson' s best work appeared on 
the album. "Let it be." in the song 
"Unsatisfied." Although the lyrical 
quality of the 'Mats never suffered 
after Siinson's departure, his raw 
energy while playing the guitar was 
missed. 

In closing I would like to quote a 
hne from the 'Mais LP 'Tim:" 
The ones who love us best 
Are Ihe ones we'll lay to rest 
And visit Iheir graves on holiday; 
at best 
Good-bye Bob . .

The water ski club was 
formed last fall. Last year, the

by point totals. 

Buchcr said he anticipates 
most of the practices taking place 
at Lake Mirage or in front of 
IPFW on St. Joe River. The 
spring season will probably last 
from the 3rd week of April to the

blocking out., .we're trying lo criss- 
aoss down low, where help-side is 
boxing out that player we're 
froniing." said IPFW coach Pam 
Bowden, "If we can have that many 
rebounds every game. I'd be 
happy," she added.

would be more of ibe same as LU 
revved up to 10-poini lead diree 
minutes into die half, 

WiUi plans sei for take-off, how- 
ever, the Ma-stodons slowly disman- 
tled ihc Ryer^ and look a five-point 
lead wiU) eight-and-a-half minutes 
to play. They pounded the ball 
inside on offense, and hit I6-of-20 
free dirows as a result. 

"We addressed those issues with 
the kids (at half-time), and they 
agreed diat Lewis wasn't doing any- 
thing dial was causing us problems 
on our offense. ..it was our carelcs,s- 
ness or lack of cohesiveness or 
diings just weren't clicking...so we 
decided to go inside early and 
often, " said Piazza, 

"1 thought Bond and. second 
half. Jason Burkhan...we just went 
inside 10 them and to try lo draw 
fouls," added Piazza. "Thai's ihe 
first time in a., .God. I can'i remem- 
ber the last lime we attempted more 
free throws than the opponents did. ' 
he said. 

LU coach praised the 
Mastodons. "I think it showed a lot 
of character by their (IPFW's) kids. 
They came back and did a real nice 
job," he said, "1 think Andy's got a 
nice group of kids. He's going lo 
have a real good basketball team.,.l 
thought Fort Wayne really out- 
played us the last fifteen minutes. 
They shot die ball awfully well, " he 
added 

"One referee said. .'Your kids 
seem lo play well when they're 
behind.' I told him. 'They just do 
dial to make me grow older quick- 
ly'," Piazza joked. 

The teams conUnued to joust for 
the next several minutes, with Uie 
Flyers closing the gap to a point 
once, until one minute remained to 
play. 

From there, with IPFW clinging 
to a 77-71 lead, freshman Steve 
Sanders and sophomore Jeff 
Jackson took over, scoring seven of 
the last nine points on five free 
throws and a transition bucket for 
die fmal margin, 

IPFW improved lo 5-8 in Ihe 
GLVC, akeady one win belter than 
all of last year.
