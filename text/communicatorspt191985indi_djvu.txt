Beering told Ihe Foundation and Ihe 
audience, numbering close to 75, the 
decision was an informal agreement. 
He said formal paperwork would be 
presented al a later dale. 

The change in the daily reporting of 
routine matters is a "cosmetic 
change," according to Ryan, bul one 
that is important lo the presidents of 
Purdue and Indiana. 

Jeanne Miller, an lU Purdue 
Foundation member, disagrees. "It's 
more than a cosmetic change, il may 
l&gt;e a whole change in emphasis," said 
Miller. The missions of the two 
universities are different, said Miller, 
and the main controller's philosophy 
could prevail 

Miller pointed oul that according to a 
written agreement between the 
trustees of Purdue and Indiana dated 
July 1, 1981, an evaluation committee 
was lo study the university governance 
and lo make recommendations 
regarding the unifications of the 
campus by Dec. 30, 1984. 

She said to her knowledge this had not 
been done in the process of making the 
management agreement. 

When asked to comment on Miller's 
statements, Beering declined. 

Miller said later she was leery of 
gentlemen's agreements and personal 
friendships in making these decisions. 
She noted the two men (Beerine and 
Ryan) are cooperative now, but in the 
futurethey may not be. She also pointed 
oul the possibility one of their suc- 
cessors may not be as cooperative and 
in Ihe end this could harm the campus. 

Harriet Inskeep, another member of 
the lU-Purdue Foundation, is also 
concerned about this decision. In a 
statement she prepared for the 
Foundation meeting, Inskeep said, "No 
matter how routine we try to make it ... 
if the budgetary aird reporting lines 
both run lo one source tliat's where the 
power is. The knowledge of that one 
source permeates the thinking, the 
actions and ihe planning ol the business 
and all ils ancillary activities." 

Carolyn Gutman, president of the lU- 
Purdue Foundation, remarked on the

academic progress both universities 
have made m Fort Wayne. "I would 
hope that in the planning and concerns 
... we must not lose ground on programs 
we have fought to keep here," said 
Gutman. 

A main concern of faculty and 
students is the new decision possibly 
heavily favoring Purdue programs 
over Indiana programs in the future. 

In a statistical report presented to the 
Foundation by Edward Nicholson, 
acling chancellor, he foresees an in- 



crease in graduate programs in 
engineering and technical areas. He 
added some growlh may l)e possible in 
the areas of education and business. 
However, according lo Nicholson, Ihe 
latter area of concent ration seems to be 
declining. 

Beering, in his address, delivered a 
similar message saying, "I'm hopeful 
this campus will continue to be a 
comprehensive resource. ... of science 
and technology with a liberal 
sprinkling of the arU," said Beering. 

"In West Lafayette and Bloomington, 



this move is seen as benign, as con- 
venient, and as a suitable Irade-off of 
educational leadership in the slate," 
said Inskeep, 

Suggestions for the search and screen 
committee members will be taken this 
week by Beering and Kyan now that an 
informal agreement has been made, 
said Beering. 

The presidents were wailing lo begin 
work on the search and screen com- 
millee until a management agreement 
has been reached. 



Students must meet admission requirements 



By ANDREA SYTSMA 
Staff Writer 

There has been an old wives' tale that everyone has heard, that IPFW will accept 
anyone that applies, but since 1964, that isn't true. 

In l%0. Indiana University adopted admissions requirements that each fresh- 
man and transfer student had to meet in order lo be accepted. This went into effect 
in l%4. 

The requirements at IPFW are the same as if applying to Indiana-Bloomington 
or Purdue-Lafayette, 

Because Indiana and Purdue are Iwo separate universities, they have different 
requirements: basically they look at the same things. Both require Ihat the student 
applying to IPFW are one, in Ihe upper half of their class; Iwo, have a minimum of 
870 on their SAT scores, three, four years of high school English; and four, nine 
other units (full courses! in subjects such as social sciences, science, math and 
foreign language 

The universities then balance all this together and weigh it oul. Test scores are 
considered less significant than a person's performance in high school. The ad- 
missions office feels that everyone ts entitled lo a bad day, and some people just 



don'l test well. Students who receive poor grades in high school and do well on their 
SAT or ACT test may be indicating that they are innately smart but goofed off in 

high school. 

There are exceptions, however, where SATseores counl jusl as heavily as school 
rankings. The engineering deparlment. for an example, requires thai a student 
has a minimum of 400 on Ihe verbal part of the SAT test and 500 on the math part. 

The universities consider a person out of high school for more than three years 
an adult. This means that although clas.s rank and lest scores are looked at, they 
aren't counted as heavily as someone just coming out of high school. Their reason; 
adult students are usually belter pupils. Their molivalion is higher, they know 
there is something better than what Ihey have, 

Changesarecomingincampus admission, duelo the changes that are occurring 
in the Indiana high schools. As an example, Indiana University has a committee 
recommendinglolhel.U. Admissions and Board of Trustees that they increase the 
academic units a sludent must have and lo have certain high school courses 
required in order to be admitted to Indiana University. However, these changes 
will probably not go into effect for three or four years in order lo allow high school 
students to make adjustments. 



Program director to develop channel 23 



By JACK GRIFFIN 
Staff Writer 

Angela Scofield, Program Director 
for the College channel, is looking 
forward to 'developing Channel 23." 
Scofield, an IPFW graduate, talked of 
some of the things lo come to the 
channel, such as satellites, originally 
produced, and purchased, program- 
ming. 

The satellite dishes are expected to 
arrive in September or October and will 
be receiving programming from a 
couple networks. One of these is the 
Spanish Inlernalional Network (SIN) 
and from this network, channel 23 will 
cablecast a Spanish soap opera, 
newscast, and various specials for 
students wishing to brush up on their 
Spanish homework. The other network 
is the Silent Network, featuring 
programming that deals with issues 
that concern Ihe deaf and hearing 
impaired. 

Scofield abo plans on cablecasting 
originally produced programs, such as 
lectures, informational shows — and 
even a magazine program is in the 
works. Scorield also mentioned that she 



is interested in cablecasting Mastodon 

tiaskelball. 

The third kind of programming 
Scofield is working on is purchased 
programs produced by outside 
production houses, but this will mean 
seeking funds from the community. 

Scofield has a degree in Radio, 
television and Film which she received 
from IPFW She originally had planned 
on going into journalism and liked 
writing, but discovered that if one adds 
video one can show and tell a story. She 
then started as a volunteer al Channel 
10, and rmaily became the Public Ac- 
cess Coordinator there. 

When her job became almost routine 
she started looking for something more 
challenging and found that there was an 
opening at Channel 23. She applied, she 
was interviewed, and she got the job. 
She seems pretty happy about the move 
and feels Itial Channel 23 is important 
to the campus txicause it is an excellent 
tool for education and a unique outlet 
for creativity She also thinks the 
station can change the adage of IPFW 
be\r\g "By-Pass High ' and make people 
realize that this is a serious campus.

Will I.U. Programs 
really be unaffected? 



Monday at the Indiana-Purdue 
Foundation meeting, Purdue President 

Steven Beering and Indiana President 
John Ryan confirmed iheir informal 
agreement regarding the management 
decision. 

If their "gentleman's agreement" 
receives approval of the lU and Purdue 
trustees, the new chancellor of IPFW, 
whoever that may be. will report only to 
the Purdue president concerning routine 
matters, 

After their addresses, the opportunity 
for discussion on the matter was offered, 

Harriett Inslteep, an lU-Purdue 
Foundation member, spoke up and 
voiced her opinion. "In West Lafayette 
and in Bloomington this move is seen as 
benign, as convenient and as a suitable 
tradeoff of educational leadership in the 
stale. It does not appear lo me, however, 
to be in the best interests of the students 
and citizens of Fort Wayne and 
Northeastern Indiana." 

Don Powers, a member from the 
Purdue side, then spoke up and told 
Inskeep that he thought she was out of 
line in what she said but that he 
respected her opinion. Staling an 
opposing view shouldn't be considered 
out of line, Mr. Powers. 

We agree with Inskeep. Although ■ 
Ryan says that no one was deliberately 
left out of this matter, some people 
disagree. 

Consequently, a lot of these same 
people feel that the presidents' decision achieve. 



may not be in the best interests of 
students and faculty in the long run. 
What will happen 10 or 15 years down the 
road, or even sooner, when Purdue and 
Indiana are not run by Beering and 
Ryan, two men who appear to get along 
extremely well? 

What if some other president decides 
to take advantage of the friendly 
agreement Beering and Ryan struck? 
What will happen to the Indiana 
academic programs, students, and 
faculty here at IPFW then? 

Inskeep said in her statement to the 
foundation members that "no matter 
how routine we try to make it ... if the 
budgetary and reporting lines both run ■ 
to one source, that's where the power 
is." She is right. It is all well and good to 
say we will be fair to both schools, but 
when it comes down to money 
management, things don't always go the 
way we say they will. Feelings, peer 
pressure and a person's own unique 
mindset — background — could 
interfere. 

If the trustees approve the presidents' 
decisions, we will have to pay attention 
to all of these things. 



Hopefully, the truth is being told, and 
Indiana University's involvement with 
their programs and faculty here won't 
be harmed. If the truth isn't being told. 
IPFW may lose the 20 years of progress 
so many people have worked hard to 



Administration drops

K appears that the HPER 
iHealth, Physical Education 
and Recreation) department 
has long suffered a foster 
child attitude al IPFW, 
having been passed around 
between various offices and- 



Commentary 



or academic unil^ over the 
past 15 years or so. 

Apparently its initial 
academic home was in the 
Dean of Faculty's office, 
which at that tim-? housed 
many academic "homeless" 
or iransfer-iype programs. 
From there it was trans- 
ferred lo the Division of 
Continuing Education, which 
al (he time administered 
some credit programs along 
with its numerous non-credit 
offerings. 

When a full-time athletic 
director was hired in 1975-76, 
HPEIi was transferred to 
the athletic office where it 
remained until funding was 
approved for the multi- 
purpose building. At that 
lime. Ihe vice chancellor's 



office transferred the 
program to the Division of 
Education, along with a 
S3,000 allocation specifically 
designaled lo expand course 
offerings in preparation for 
the move into the new 
athletic facility. A HPER 
faculty position was also 
authorized and later filled by 
a person who taught 
physical education credit 
courses and coached 
^somen's basketbaU. 

It's been ralher common 
knowledge, both on campus 
and in the community, that 
the need For the multipur- 
pose building was "sold " to 
the stale legislature with 
essentially four stated 
purposes, the very first 
being to " ... provide a co- 
educutlonal laclUty lo 
conduct physical education 
classes, bolh service and 
professional." 

The proposal itself and 
subsequent lobbying efforts 
went lo great lengths lo 
emphasize the need for a 
strong basic service- 
academic program ... "the 
facility will enable the 
campus lo offer the first two 
years of the Indiana 
University HPER major 
with subsequent transfer to 



another campus " 



The present ad- 

ministration's response for 
eliminating all but one 
graduate credit HPER of- 



and 



one un- 



fering

this fall semester is budget 
priorities. This indeed is an 
odd response particularly 
since all the HPER offerings 
would have been "money 
makers," insofar as they 
typically closeout early in 
registration each year. One

J. p. sez! 

By MARK RUSSELL 

Who else but publisher 

Rupert Murdoch would come 

oul with a newspaper column 

by Pope John Paul II without 




clothing styles have to do 
with keeping warm Think of 
an assembly line of missiles 
as a fashion show. 

"And now. coming out on

autumn colors amid 
sparkling laser accessories 
— we call this heavenly 
creation Star Wars, just the 
right outfit (or that chance 



Mark Russell 



Murdoch will probably give 
it a dignified title like "J.P 
Sez." 

Murdoch's New York Post 
will probably place the 
Pope's first column t&gt;etween 
the daily ax murder and a 
stor^ on the blood-drinking 
pygmy dognappers which 
plague Brooklyn. 

In some Murdoch papers 
that would be the religious 
page 

Murdoch is using John 
Paul's previous writing but 
the idea ol a Pope doing a 
newspaper column isn't 
unusual when you think 
atwut it. The difference is — 
most columnists only think 
they are infallible. 

Star Wars: 

Heavenly 

encounter 

The arms buildup has 
nothing to do with survival 
any more Ihan the new fall 



encounter." 

Nothing is more em- 
barrassing than being seen 
in last year's funny-looking 
nuclear fashions — that wide 
nose cone, (he baggy 
megatonnage — now, really! 

The defense industry 
demands that our deterrent 
needs have the look and feel 
of super tailoring and im- 
peccable taste. So. whether 
you've been sold a new suit 
or this season's technology 

— it's still a bill of goods. 
Once we build Star Wars. 

at last we'll be safe. Believe 
that and you'll also believe 
the length of hemlines will 
never change. 

Reagan meets 
Tutu halfway 

President Reagan has 
imposed sanctions on South 
Africa. Talk about confusing 

— if you don't like our South 
Africa policy, wait a minute. 



Reagan may have upset 
the archconservatives by 
switching signals but he's 
still the Great Com- 
municator. The new 
American gold coins will 
have Jerry Falwell's picture 
on them. 

Does all this mean that 
blacks now have a friend in 
the White House? Well, 
perhaps more like a casual 
acquaintance. 

It also means that Reagan 
has met Bishop Tutu half- 
way . Tutu is drowning zo feet 
away from tlie boat and 
Reagan threw him 10 feet of 
rope. 

One man 
One plane 

A congressman who will 
remain Bill Alexander of 
Arkansas recently took a 
junket to South America on 
an otherwise empty 42-seat 
Air Force plane. His enemies 
are furious. His friends say 
he had a lot of luggage. 

You've heard of one man, 
one vole? This is one man, 
one plane. 

The congressman's lonely 
trip cost the taxpayers 
$56,000 — thereby making 
the Air Force's $75,000 
coffeemaker on hoard lose 
its significance. 

1 undersUind he wanted lo 
take a cruise — but another 
congressman was already 
using the USS New Jersey. 

Boogie to

A nauseating word has 
crept inlo the language

Letter 



To the Editor: 

Your Sept. 12, 1985 issue 
was the tiest I've ever seen 
on this campus. The articles 
were interesting and in- 
formative and even Ihe 
cartoon was one of the 
quality we might find in Ihe 
cal or national press. 
As long as the ad- 
inislration of IPFW en- 
lurages a relationship of 
hostility and distrust bel- 
1 itself and the students 
of this university, we need a 
paper thai will function as an 
advocate of the students. We 
need to know what is really 
happening on this campus 
and why it is really hap- 
ng and your paper is 
doing a belter job all Ihe 
time of letting us know. 
Thank you. Keep up the good 
work.

IPFW Blood Drive: Win a prize, donate blood and save a life. 



By ELEANOR LAIRD 
sun Writer 

Your blood can save lives, 
but your donation can win 
you one of a number of prizes 
including $25 gift certiricates 
and free passes to athletic 
events on campus. 

Only people produce and 
supply Ihc important 
resource of human blood; 
and whether you are giving 
or receiving blood, you are 
partofa vital human lifeline. 

On Monday, Oct. 1, IPFW 
students will have a chance 
lo link up with thai lifeline. 
In theWalh Memorial Union 
Ballroom, between 9 a.m. 
and 3 p.m. Ihe American Red 
Cross Blood Services in Fort 
Wayne will be set up and 
staffed lo receive IPFW 
donors. Door prizes will be 
awarded to lucky donors. 

It's easy lo donate — the 
entire process is painless 



and simple and lakes less 
than an hour. Donation time 
takes less than 10 minutes. 
Just sign up at any one of the 
appointment tables located 
on campus, or contact one o( 
Uic following: 
Kettler: Information Desk 
Helmke Library: Cir- 
culation 
Walb: Sweet Shoppe 
You are eligible to donate 
if you are 17 through 65, 
weigh at least 110 pounds, 
and arc in good health. A 
brief medical history will be 
taken mo dates needed!. It's 
advisable lo have breakfast 
or some other good meal 
before donating blood. 
Cookies, soft drinks, and 
juice will be on hand before 
and after donating. 

Qualified and licensed 
nurses use individual sterile 
needles that are discarded 
after one-lime use. Less than 



a pint of blood is taken and 
your body replaces it 
quickly. Blood may be given 
as often as every eight 
weeks. The body con- 
tinuously discards old blood 
and manufactures new. 
Donors receive no 



payment lor their blood and 
the Red Cross charges no fee 
for the blood or blood 
products delivered lo 
hospitals. Blood recipients 
are never required to 
replace blood because the 
generosity of the donors 



the Red Cross to 
me«t the total needs of all its 
participating hospitals. The 
hospitals, however, are 
billed for collecting, testing, 
storing and delivering the 
blood. 
As many as five patients 



can be helped with a single 
pint of blood, depending on 
the needs of the patient. 
Every 12 seconds someone 
needs blood Over nine 
million units ipints) of blood 
are needed every year in the 
United States, and the need 



exists seven days a week. 
The Local Red Cross Blood 
Center annually draws 
more than 60.000 units of 
blood in northern Indiana 
and northwestern Ohio and 
supplies 100 percent ot the 
total needs lo the 2.3 million 



people who live in this area.

SUBOG sponsors films, trips and parties 



By EARL SMITH 
Chief Reporter 

The first of many ac- 
tivities planned by the 
Sludenl Union Board of 
Governors (SUBOG) oc- 
curred a couple of weeks 
ago, SUBOG and Sigma Phi 
Epsilon traternily co- 
sponsored a Back-To-School 
Parly at the Hoagland 
Hayloft. 



Due to several unfilled 
positions on SUBOG. board 
members worked overtime 
organizing activities for this 
semester, said Lisa Sewell, 
SUBOG chair. 

Two other parlies are 
scheduled this semester, 
plus two bus trips, two ski 
trips during Christmas 
break, a film series, and the 



Gaff, chief of police, leads 
department in uniform manner 



By MAITRAFTHEE 
Stall Writer 

Most of the campus is 
unaware ot how the IPFW 
police force works, not to 
mention who Ihe chief of 
campus police even is. 

L.arry Gaff, a May '85 
graduate of the IPFW school 
of nursing, is the Hrst IPFW 
graduate lo be police chief on 
campus. He also holds 
degrees in general studies 
and administrative justice. 

In addition to his academic 
background. Gaff also 
served with Ihe Air Force 
military police, and on 
weekend campus security 
here at IPFW starting m 
1977. In 1979, he received a 
degreefrom the Indiana Law 
Enforcement Academy. He 
then moved up the ranks to 
campus police officer, and 
on March 1, 19B5, Gaff 
became chief. 

Gaff's main respon- 
sibilities consist of campus 
safety and campus law 
enforcement. He is in charge 
of upholding the safely 
standards of all buildings on 
campus, and reports to the 
inspectors of the Operational 
Safety and Health Ad- 
ministration. 

Many people assume the 
campus police are merely 
pushover security cops who 
exist to be ignored or 
laughied at. Not so! The 
campus police can lake you 
downtown, or send you to the 
dean ot students. According 
lo Gaff, officers have the 
power to administer punish- 
ment as Ihey see fit. Respect 
suddenly seems more 



becoming when 
Ihe difference between a 
phone call to a parent or a 
trip lo the Allen County 
Lockup. Gaff adds that 
respect lo his officers will 
result in the same being 
returned. 

Students should note that 
as of last weekend. Gaff has 
had the campus patrolled on 
Saturday and Sunday. Also, 



people parkii 
against the flow ot traffic at 
the new meters either 
ticketed or lowed. Parking 
on the grass will also result 
in lowing, and anyone 
ulili2ing a false or stolen 
permit will be towed at his or 
her expense, fined $25, and 
face judicial and-or ad- 
ministrative action. 
Gaff, most importantly, is 



nits lo 
mistakes and he also ex- 
plains that he slill has much 
lo learn in order to be a 
certifiable master of his 
crall. He urges anyone who 
has a problem with, or 
questions about campus 
police procedure to come 
and talk with him. He will be 
glad lo examine all 
problems, big or small.

Murray enjoys friendly atmosphere of the campus 



By SEB.ASTIAN CHAPMAN 
surf Writer 

Envision a painting that 
looks like it's t&gt;een blasted by 
a sawed off shotgun and, 
nearby, paintings of human 
limbs thrown together to 
form God knows what. Isthis 
madness? No, it's the first 
thing you see upon entering 
the office of IPFW's theatre 
director. Joel Murray. "It's 
all experimental," he ex- 
plained 

Murray is in his first year 
on campus and finds the 
atmosphere here warm and 
accommodating. "In New 
Hampshire and on the East 
coast, where I was reared, 
people tend to be cold. 
They're friendly people, but 
they just don't walk up to you 
and say, 'hello,' or start a 
conversation as many people 
here do," he said. Murray 
hopes thai the friendly at- 
mosphere here will allow 
him to experiment with his 
theatrical productions. "You 
never know if something will 
workuntilyou try it." 



completed 
teaching fellowship at 
Bowling Green University, 
sponsored by the graduate 
school there. Murray 
directed the play "The 
Dining Room." written by A. 
R. Gurney, and continued to 
work on his Ph. D in theatre, 
which he will receive this 
Spring. 

Wtiile in Bowling Gre€n, 
he also released his in- 
triguing new play, "Dire 
Straits," that deals with a 
New Hampshire family 
plagued with a history of 
incest. 

"In the play, the main 
character is raped by his 
father, then finds out later 
that his father was also 
raped by his fattier. This, 
along with his un/ound 
sexuality, causes his 
grandfather to pair him with 
a prostitute, not to spark his 
manhood, but for the en- 
joyment he gets (rom 
watching, ' said Murray. 

Controversy and ex- 
perimentation are what 



Murray l&gt;elieves really good 
plays are made of. Another 
play he wrote. "American 
Standards," reveals how 
Americans are led into 
different predicaments by 
influential or fashionable 
people. 

Being tjom on the West 
Coast and reared in the East 
probably accounts for his 
love of experimentation, 
since he's been introduced to 
so many walks of life. "I like 
romanceas much as the next 
guy, but today's audience is 
looking for more than a 
Romeo and Juliet theatre 
experience." He plans to 
accomplish this by directing 
plays that possess a great 
deal of "energy." 

Murray, who has two 
years of professional acting 
experience, said he loves to 
act and doesn't want to stray 
too far (rom it. Although he 
looks back at those two years 
and laughs fondly, he 
stresses that, "There are 
times when you may be 
eating out of a tuna can for a 



month But, if you want it, 
you have to be willing to put 
everything inlo it. Eat, sleep 
and drink theatre." 

His first production. "Fool 
For Love," is scheduled to 
be released Nov. 22. It in- 
volves "two people who are 
passionately in love, but it's 
an atypical love story. It's 
very volatile," he said. 

Working together, Larry 
Life and Murray will lead 
theatre goers to the "bare 
bones" of the human con- 
dition through plays that 
portray life in a very serious 
manner. 

Murray loves for an 
audience to become involved 
in his plays and to show how 
much Ihey appreciate and 
enjoy the theatre. "I have a 
friend who would laugh out 
loud during a play when no 
one else was laughing, and 
he really enjoyed the 
theatre. Soon, I found myself 
doing exactly as he does and 
having a great lime."

med Manilove after at- 
tending a Barry Manilow 



International Fan Club 
convention in 1984. 

Members of this fan club 
do more than carve pictures 
of their idol from teen- 
oriented magazines. They're 
definitely above staring 
glassy-eyed at VH-1 while 
Manilow and his om- 
nipresent V-neck sweater 
sing about Mandy. 

In the BMIFC's charter, a 
stipulation pertaining (o all 
chapters is the need to be 
affiliated with a charitable 
organization. 

"We work with the March 
of Dimes' Walkathon," 
Donesa said. She and her 
compatriots loaded up 
supplies at Johnny 
Appleseed Park, the start- 
end of the course, then 
proceed to Lawlon Park to 
act as a checkpoint. This was 
at9a.m. 

"At our checkpoint, we 
probably came in contact 
with all 600 of the walkers."

she said. "Our checkpoint 
was the first and last, as the 
participants walked the 22 
miles of the course " 

The supplies at Donesa's 
checkpoint included such 
staples as water, apples, 
cookies and sweet snacks. 
She rendered such services 
as verifying the walker's 
pledge cards and handing 
out Band-Aids. 

"Our biggest problem was 
that the day was very hot 
and sunny," she explained, 
"and we kept rutinmg out of 
bottled water." This leads us 
to the most frequently asked 
pair of queslions: "Where's 
the water fountain?" and 
"Where's the nearest 
restroom?" 

"Toilet paper was a 
precious commodity — we 
gave out a lot of itJ" she 
giggled Donesa also handed 
out encouragement and 
helped to contact rides back

Scofield: behind the scenes at channel 23 Iviolinist opens Philharmonic 



By lltlLLY RAVER 

SlafllVriter 

And 

M. KATHLEEN CREVEN 

Fealures Editor 
This, ladies and gen- 
tlemen, IS what Angie 
ScoHeld really looks like. 

Scofield IS [he director of 
programming for cable 
channel 23 and an IPFW 
graduate of the radio, T.V. 
and film program of the 
communications depart- 



ment To snap this picture, 
the photographer had to pry 
a camera loose from her eye 
socket and surgically 
remove a set of headphones 
only an audiophile would 
love 

Sitting still at a desk like 
this is not her natural 
habitat. Her day begins with 
a 6:30 a.m. swim at the 
YWCA. "I was on a swim 
team while growing up. 
Swimming help keeps the 




tension away," she said. 

But Scofield wasn't on a 
swim team just to paddle 
around in the pool wearing a 
cute bathing suit. "I have to 
admit that I'm competitive," 
she confided. 

■'It was good for me, 
though, because it helped to 
prepare me for working in 
the 'real world'." 

She is sUII involved in 
women's sports. most 
recently helping to "mark 
bodies" of Run, Jane, Run 
irialhalon participants. This 
involves wTLting the number 
of the contestant in several 
places on her txidy with 
magic marker, since 
wearing a pinned-on number 
isn't practical in this event. 

"It's exciting for your 
body to be able to do what 
you want it to do." Scofield 
said "1 feel that if you are in 
control of your tx»dy, you can 
tie more in control of your 
life." 

Being in control is a 
familiar state for her lately. 
She was the access co- 
ordinator for cable channel 
10 before she signed on as the 
director of programming for 
channel 23. 

"My new job is pretty 
much an extension of what I 
dadatchannel 10," she said. 
■We like to think of channel 
23 as the "Channel of Un- 
derstanding," Scofield ex- 
plained, "and our goal is to 
offer programs that most 
peopledon'l have access to." 

One innovative program in 
the works is "Outhne." a 
magazine format show to air 
in October. A series 
specifically for the deaf and 
blind members of the 
audience is also planned. 

The maga^ine format 
show^ will consist of four 
features dealing with such 
topics as an IPFW childcare 
facility and the Continuing 
Education program. 



Scofield's initial interest 
was in written forms of 
communication. She'd once 
hoped to write features tor a 
magazine. 

"After overcoming my 
fear of audio equipment, 1 
learned to appreciate video. 
You can do a lot more with 
your words than to just 
commit them to print. It's 
really a lot of fun to see your 
work moving before you." 
she said- 
She likened the 
gratification of producing 
television segments to 
another one of her passions, 
sewing. 

"Vou have your pattern in 
sewing, and that's like the 
script Then, as you piece 
together that garment or 
shoot the video, your idea is 
transformed before your 
eyes. It takes on life — and 
it's a reflection of me," she 
explained 

Besides her duties at 
channel 23, Scofield also 
works with the IPFW 
Communications Club, 
Students do not have to be a 
communications major to 
participate in the IPCC. 
Membership in neither 
group is a prerequisite to be 
involved with channel 23. 

"If you are willing to 
develop a good idea, to edit, 
produce or work with the 
equipment, we can use you," 
she said. 

No credits are currently 
available for the volunteer 
work, but Scofield an- 
ticipates an internship in the 
future 

"Working with video is a 
really good experience It's 
just pulling everything God 
gave you and channeling it 
into one medium. It's very 
rewarding."

'Manilove' 

I Continued froin page -II 
A less grueling aspect of 

Manilove's activities is 
attending Manilow's con- 
certs. 

"We decorated Barry's 
dressing room when he 
appeared in concert at 
Purdue University last 
summer!" Donesa ex- 
claimed. The group 
festooned Manilow's 
dressing roOm with posti^rs 
and left behind small gifi^, 
"to make him feel weiconifd 
and more at home." 

She's attended more than 

II concerts since 1980 and 
traveled as far as Chicago 
and Toronto, Canada, to 
participate in conventions, 
where Manilow appeared. 

Watching Manilow on 
stage crooning about Mandy 
must make their work for 
the March of Dimes seem 
like just another day in the 
park.

Company 
The 



Philha 



Hiatt settles in with Campus Ministry 



Bv KELLlKIRKPATRICK 
Statf Writer 
Gayle Hiatt '"never 
thought in a million years" 
she'd be working on a college 
campus 

The blonde, blue-eyed, 21- 
year-old had waved "bye- 
bye" to the scholastic life 
after graduating from 
Mississinewa High School in 
jCas City, in 1982. She said 
Ishe had no plans to further 
'her studies and go on to 
college, 

"After I graduated, 1 
wanted to be a secretary 
somewhere. And I wanted to 
be a Christian wife and 
mother I've alwaysbelieved 



in doing what I fed the Lord 
is telling me to do." said 
Hiatt. 

Not surprisingly, the 
divine intervention came in 
the form of part-time 
secretarial jobs, marriage to 
her high school sweetheart, 
Lyndon, and singmg in the 
family gospel group, the 
"Psalm 100 Singers." 

But the latest intervention 
came in the form of a 
classified ad in the Journal- 
Gazette last June. While 
skimming through the ads, 
Hiatt said one in particular 
stood out above the rest. It 
was an ad for a secretary 
"'committed to ministry and 
higher education." 



Hiatt immediately sent 
her resume' to the post office 
box listed and, three days 
later, received a call from 
Sonja Redmon, former 
campus ministry secretary. 
Redmon set up an interview 
for Hiatt with the Reverend 
Margaret McCray-Worrail, 
IPFW campus minister. And 
a week later, Hiatt learned 
the job was hers. 

Redmon. who graduated 
from IPFW last May with an 
associate degree in super- 
vision and a job prospect in 
San Jose. Calif., said she was 
excited about Hiatt's arrival. 
"'Having someone here all 
the time will help students a 
lot, because they know 



there's someone here they 
can talk to when Margaret's 
gone. Because I was going to 
school full-time, my time 
here was limited," she said. 

Prior to taking the job with 
campus ministry, Hiatt had 
been working for North 
American Cattle Corp. and 
then Clear Creek Enter- 
prises, both located in 
Covington Creek Plaza and 
both part-time secretarial 
positions. 

Hiatt can be found in Walb 
Union, room 221 from 9 to 
3:30 p,m. Monday through 
Friday. 

Although the new en- 
deavor is part-time, Hiatt 
says she likes the "stability 



of going to work every day 
and knowing I have set 
hours." And, she includes a 
predicable pay check. 

She's even enrolled in a 
continuing education fitness 
class. 

"I like the campus at- 
mosphere. I like working 
with Margaret, she's patient 
and understanding. She's 
easy going with me." But, 
she teases, 'My word 
processor's a suckerl" 

So much for collegelile. 

Hiatt lives with her 
husband Lyndon, 23, a 
computer technician at CPT 
Word Processing and her 
son, Adam, one, in Roanoke.

Booters lose, 3-0 



By MIKE MALONEY 
Sports Editor 

Disappointing is the word 
that keeps coming up in 
conversation with IPFW 
Soccer Coach Terry 
Stefankiewicz about the 
current campaign. 

The Mastodons' record is 
0-3, but worse than that, the 
team has yet lo score a goal. 
They were, however, 
credited with a goat in the 
team's five to one loss to St. 
Louis. The ball was ac- 
cidentally deflected into the 
IPFW goal of f of the heel of a 
St . Louis player's toot. 

Saturday, their luck didn't 
improve against Indiana 
Central University at 
Indianapolis The 

Greyhounds came out on top, 
three lo nothing. 

"We played our passing 
game very well." 

Stefankiewicz said. "We just 
couldn't finish iscore)." 

Stefankiewicz can't pin- 
point the team's problem. 
It's not youth, as the team 
has experience. "It has been 
the topic of many long 
discussions," he said. "We 



move the ball down the field 
real well, but we just can't 
get il in the net." 

The Indiana Central game 
is a good case in point. The 
Mastodons out-shot the host 
Greyhounds 20 to four, with 
the game winner not hitting 
the nets until only three 
minutes remained lo be 
played in the game. 
Stefankiewicz said his team 
played a much better game 
than did Indiana Central. 

"Soccer is a funny game," 
he said. "One team can 
dominate entirely, only to 
lose in the waning moments 
of the game," 

The Mastodons hope their 
fortune will improve for 
their home opener this 
Saturday. The day-long 
soccer extravaganza will be 
higniighted by the varsity 
game against defending 
GLVC champion University 
of Southern Indiana at i p.m. 
The game will be co- 
sponsored by the local 
chapter of the Association of 
Retarded Children (A.R.C.) 
with one-half of the proceeds 
going to that organization.

Harriers finisli 8th at Grace 



ByJBNNYBLAKLEV 

Staff Writer 

Any sport requires a full 
team effort, even an ap- 
parently individual spori 
such as cross country. 

When a misfortune arises, 
the total team spirit and 
performance can be 
negatively affected. 
Although IPFW had several 
liandicaps, such as various 
injuries and the loss of a 
runner, several of the 
harriers performed well, 
coming closer to or ex- 
ceeding their goals. The 
Mastodons finished 8th out of 
11 teams Saturday al Grace 
College. 

A major factor in the 
team's performance 

Saturday was the loss of one 
of the lop runners. Pat Rice, 
who apparently quit the 
team. Coach Barrie 
Petenion said "That affects 
everyone else's per- 
formances. It's a shock thai 
they will have to face and get 
over. But the guys will pull 
logelher now." 

DougSawyer, who finished 
30th, incurred an accident 
while practicing last Mon- 
day. He stepped in a hole on 
a golf course, "We had him 
take it easy for a couple of 
days, but (because of the 
injury) he didn't run up to 
par," Peterson said. Also, 
Steve McNulty, who finished 
in 6flth place, has a hip in- 



jury, "He is capable of 
running in the top five," 
Peterson said. "He tries 
hard and is very com- 
petitive. He just needs lo rest 
for a couple of days," 

Senior Tom Hoffman 
finished I'lth out of ap- 
proximately 100 runners, 
and clocked his all-time best 
personal record of 27:14. "He 
exceeded his goal by six 
seconds. He ran extremely 
well," Peterson said- 
Other good finishers, 
coming within 20 seconds of 
their personal goab. were 
Mark Kuhn in 'tSrd place. 
Rich Jereb, in 55lh place and 
Jeff Messman, in 62nd place 
overall, Peterson com- 
mented on the positive 
aspects of the meet, "We 
averaged -1-56 seconds (56 
seconds over the runner's 
goals) per man. That's 
posifive, compared to +%1 in 
the Valparaiso meet. We're 
coming closer lo our goals," 
(but) we still need lo close 
the gap between the first 
(topi few runners and the 
rest of the team, though, 
which is 2:49." Rounding out 
the IPFW field were Todd 
Eagen in 52nd place; Bob 
Swinehart, S6th, and Randy 
Widdifield finished in 58th 
place. 

The women also ran well 
Saturday. Krisll Walker 
finished third in the com- 
petition, with a time of 18:37,

three seconds under her 
goal "Any time you run 
under 19 minutes, you're 
doing well. That's the con- 
tinuous progress I'd like to 
see out of her," Peterson 
said. 

An addition lo the women 
runners. Junior Rita Boyle 
placed 28th. "Rita has never 
run cross country t)etore 
She did a really good job. " 

Other women finishers 
were Carol Van Horn in 25th 
place and another new face, 
Alejandrina Hernandez, in 
43rd. 

A fifth runner could enable 
the women to compete as a 
team, not simply as in- 
dividual runners This will 
possibly be accomplished by 
the conference meet, on 
October 26. Peterson said 
that if any woman &lt;or man) 
is interested in running cross 
country, it's not too late to 
join the team 

This Saturday, the 
Mastodons will l&gt;e competing 
at Taylor University, against 
11 other teams. According to 
Peterson, there will be many 
strong teams running, "This 
will be even more com- 
petitive than (at) Grace. 
We're looking to bounce back
