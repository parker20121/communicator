A little less hand holding in College 

'Degree: Possible' workshops reminds students they're not in high school anymore 



ByAlyson Hess 

Htwi EdKoi 

Laughter filled Walb 
Student Union's ball- 
room last Wednesday, 
Sept. 3 during a convoca- 
tion led by Dr. Pat Ashton 
of the Sociology Depart- 
ment. Newcomers to 
IPFW treated themselves 
to a free lunch while they 
listened to "Grade 13 or 
not?" a lighthearted pre- 



sentation given by Ash- 
ton which focused on the 
differences bet^veen high 
school and college. 

The workshop, orga- 
nized by the department 
of Diversity and Multicul- 
tural Affairs, was the first 
ofseveral planned for the 
2008-2009 school year. 
The seminars are part of 
an effort to present col- 
lege students with advice 
that can be applied to 



many aspects of college 
life in order to succeed in 
every area. 

"Grade 13 or not?" em- 
phasized the importance 
oF student dedication 
and willingness to thrive 
at school. 

"No one decides how 
successful you are in life 
but you," Ashton said. 
This statement led him 
into a list of his top ten 
differences between high

Grade 13 or Not: Dr. Pat Ashton speaks to a room full of students about 
the difference between college and high school. 



school and college. 

While the differences 
ranged greatly, from less 
parental involvement 
to no tardy bells, and 
having the freedom to 
eat and drink in class to 
scheduling classes with- 
out a counselor, the gain 
of responsibility united 
them all, "There is a lot 
less handholding in col- 
lege,' Ashton said. "You 
have all of this freedom, 
but you have to use it 
ivisely." 

For every difference 
college students will en- 
counter, Ashton provid- 
ed a piece of advice. "Not 
one clock at IPFW has the 
same time," he said. 

"Therefore, learn pro- 
fessor time." His sugges- 
tions also included put 
ling cell phones away 
during class, dozing with 
chin in hand instead of 
head on desk during lec- 
tures, communicaiinj; 
with professors. siud\- 
ing an ample amount of 
time each week, uslnj;

advantage of university'

150th Anniversary 
of The Great Debates 

Indiana's Candidates for Governor to Hold Three 



ByDanJehl 

sun Writer 



In 1858. the modem 
polilical circuit began 
with seven town hall de- 
bates in Illinois. Repub- 
lican Abraham Lincoln 
and Democrat Stephen 
Douglas traveled to all 
seven ol Illinois' congres- 
sional districts and held 
three-hour long, non- 
televised 



bates between the two 
candidates for Gover- 
nor oflndiana. 

The issues may in- 
clude: a free college 
tuition proposal equat- 
ing 10 two years worth 
of Ivy Tech-level tuition 
for every high school 
graduate; why IPFW 
ranks close to last in 
slate funding of Indi- 
ana's state colleges and 
universities; whether to 
assure all adults health 
care ac- 
and

debate, attended by an es-

before a live slate-wide 
audience, was between 
Jill Long Thompson and

candidates for the Demo-

APE you A 

STUDENT? 



By Kevin Bargnes 



University of Wiscon- 
sin commuhity members 
mourned Monday the 
death of three students 
killed in a car accident, 
and remembered them 
as enthusiastic students 
who positively affected 
the UW community. 

In attendance were 
dozens of UW students, 
staff and faculty who 
shared stories to cel- 
ebrate the lives of Rick 
Putze. Lindsey Plank and 
Dan Myers. 

"Tliese three students 
had an impact on our 
campus," said Dean of 
Students Lori Berquam, 
who led the memorial. 
"We ivill not be the same 
without them. Our world 
won't be the same with- 
out them because we 
don't know what they 
could have become." 

The three students 
were traveling on the 200 
block of Midvale Boule- 
vard on August 27 when 
their car lost control and 
struck a tree. Puize and 
Plank were pronounced 
dead at the scene, and 
Myers died later that day 
at UW Hospital. 

PuUe and Plank were 



chemistry students and 
spent a large portion of 
the summer Aiming a 
series of chemical reac- 
tions for distribution on 
the Internet. 

"This work is some- 
thing that is going to 
benefit thousands of stu- 
dents, not only the ones 
who come through the 
chemistry program here 
al the university," said 
Chad Wilkinson, chemis- 
try faculty associate. 

Frank Keutsch, assis- 
tant chemistry professor, 
remembered Plank being 
"full of life and enthusi- 
asm. You knew she was 



"Uhinkhehadthupo- 
teruial to make some very 
unusual and interesting 
connections, creative 
connections bctiveen the 
disciplines that he was 
excellent in," Welbourne 
said. "And that's what I'm 
going to miss most about 
him." 

Several students, 
friends and neighbors 
came up after the faculty 
spoke and recalled Rick's 
loveof Billy Joel and Dan's 
youth and imagination. 

Readings for the eve- 
ning came from Ecclesi- 
astes 3, made famous by 
The Byrds" "T\im! TXim! 



going to leave an impact TUmI," and Mitch AI- 
on the world because bom's memoir "Tuesdays 



she was so full of life," 
Keutsch said. "Losing 
that is just truly devastat- 
ing." 

Myers was a promis- 



with Morrie." 

In the hours and days 
following the accident, 
Berquam said she kept 
being asked one un- 



ing piano student, saiA— ajgwerable quesiipn: 
UW music professor Tom "Why?" 

"1 think the answer lies 



Welbourne. As a fresh- 
man, Welbourne said, 
Myers possessed the 
music theory talent of a 
graduate. 

Welbourne said he 



in each of our hearts, and 
it will come lo be known 
at some point," Berquam 
said. "And until then, we 
have to walk with this. 



looking forward to and be vrith this, and 

following Myers' career, know that for the short 

and described him as a amount of time each of 

person who was 'always these three people were 

ten minutes early" and with us, they left a mark 

led class with his quiet on us, left an impact."

Ninety- Four Minutes Wasted on the Movie "College" 



By Abigail Kopen 



Circlciheonclhatdoesnot 
belong: "Old School", "Van 
Wilder". "Animal House", 
"Bring II On, Again". Hope- 
fully you all circled "Bring It 
On, Again'" which was jusi 
bad news for movie waichere 
all over America. 

Similar was the case with 
ihe movie "College," which 
unfominateiy had its debut 
in iheuires on August 29. All 
1 have to say lo ihc writers, 
Dan Callahan and Adam El- 
lison is: Please come back lo 
the real worid of college life 



where fral panics don't have 
professional cage dancers 
and the bottomless keg has 
yet lo be invented. 

Needle.!&gt;s lo say, the mov- 
ie was less than impressive. 
"College," directed by Deb 
Hagan. is about three teen- 
age boys (all of which seem 
ridiculously pre-pubcsceni) 
who are soon-to-be high 
school graduates in serious 
need for a good lime and 
some college fun. 

Unfortunately, it ends up 
being more like a bad com- 
bination of "Superbad" and 
-Old School." The movie 
"College" had a very weak 
plot and some of the worst 



acting I've .seen since "Crow- 
roads" with Britany Spears. 
"College" had a hodgepodge 
of almost unrecognizable ac- 
tors like Drake Bell. Andrew 
Caldwell and Kevin Covais. 
(oncof whom may have been 
on the Disney channel five 
years ago) who made up the 
main cast. Oddly enough, all 
three of them resembled the 
close nil crew of McLovin. 
Evan, and Seih from "Super- 
bad." bul not neariy as lov- 
able and witty. 

A word of advice: skip 
seeing this movie and just 
save dial S7.50 to buy the 
soundtrack which consisted 
of mu.iic from The Rebirth 



Brass Bandund BenKweller.

For some students, 
gelling up in the morning 
to go to class last Thurs- 
day was no easy task after 
arriving home in the eariy 
hours of the morning just 
before class. As Wednes- 
day classes came to an 
end, fans began a voy- 
age from Fort Wayne to 
Noblesville to the Verizon 
Wireless Music Center lo 
see the Counting Crows, 
Maroon 5, and Augustana 
live in concert.

Suspense was definitely 
a reoccurring theme this 
evening, whether it was 
waidng on long reslroom

or for Counting Crows lo 
do their final song. Upon 
entering the lawn, 1 found 
the closest spot 1 could 
find and stood my ground 
by placing a blanket on 
the grass and awaiting 
what would be one of the 
best concerts I had every

the relendess and annoy-

fice has opened new fa- 
ciliiies on IPFW campus 
grounds at 4901 Fuller 
Dr., near the Physical 
Plant building. 

Philharmonic Board 
Chair, Eleanor Marine 
said: "The move to IPFW 
will be very positive to 
our boKom line as we 
continue our efforts to 
financially siabilize the 
Philharmonic. We will 
have better rehearsal 
space and more efficient 
offices. With the addition 
of a downtown box office 
at the Arts United Cen- 
ter, we ivill now be able 
10 serve the public at two 



locations. We appreciate 
the tremendous coop- 
eration of both IPFW and 
Arts United." 

In addition lo their new 
box office facilities on 
the IPFW campus, the 
Philharmonic is opening 
a satellite location down- 
town, in the Arts United 

Center, 

for the 



hearsal areas in their new

harmonic has contracted 
some rehearsal space 

from the IPFW Auer Per- 
formance Hall in the new

Student 
Housing 
Speaks 

Resident Assistants Chanel Macon 
and Shonda Stevenson talk with The 
Communicator about building com- 
munity across the bridge 



By Kelly McLendon 



Kelly McLendon: 
What is student housing 
doing to increase a posi- 
tive image? 

Ctianel Macon: 

hlousing is doing some- 
thing different Ihis year 
by remembering every 
resident's birthday They 
are working on sending 
birthday cards lo every 
resident to help them 
feel welcome and malte 



residents feel like they 
care about their well be- 
ing, 

KM: What do you 
think the general opin- 
ion of student housing 
is? 

Shonda Stevenson: 
it has come on our at- 
tention that many resi- 
dents feel that student 
housing is considered to 
be extremely expensive. 
But many residents have 
made the realization that 
you can get so much out 
of housing than in any 



other apartment com- 
plex. Housing provides 
programs, tutoring, mov- 
ie nights and network- 
ing with the university 
staff. Housing also gives 
residents that extra mo- 
tivadon by being in an 
atmosphere where other 
students are trying to get 
through schooi too. 

KM: Do you think 
people are more hesi- 
tant to live on campus 
thjsyear? 

SS and CM: After the 
incident we had here on 
campus last spring, we as 
a staff thought that many 
students would be hesi- 
tant to live here in the ■ 
fall. But we actually got 
the opposite affect. This 
summer housing contin- 
ued lo receive contracts 
which once again hous- 
ing filled up. 

KM: What has been 
your , favorite student 
housing activity? 

CM: Our favorite ac- 
tivities are the programs 
that we create for resi- 
dents. 

KM: How are the "RA 
divas" building commu- 
nity? 

SS: We help build a 
community by planning 
programs that help resi- 
dents meet new people. 
We also plan discussions

to help them to think 
outside their norms/ 
outside the box. We 
also plan programs that 
help residents to look at 
themselves individually 
and gain a spiritual reve- 
lation. Some of these rev- 
elations include learning 
on what their strengths 
and weaknesses arc. 

KM: Why do you do 
the job you do, as an RA? 
Why do you like it? What 
challenges does i( some- 
times present? 



SS: I enjoy being a 
role model for residents 
who live here on cam- 
pus. I also love campus 
living as a whole. Bach 
year 1 live here I meet so 
many people. My favorite 
part about the RA leader- 
ship position is planning 
programs. Some of these 
programs include par- 
ties or discussions about 
life. I considered this job 
a wonderful experience 
that many people should 
considered. I have 



learned so much about 
myself and working with 
others. This being my 
third year as a Resident 
Assistant, I have learned 
how to manage my time 
very well. 

KM: What can stu- 
dents look forward lo 
see from student hous- 
ing In the future? 
SS: Student Housing is 
working on Phase 3, in 
which they will be build- 
ing more housing for stu- 
dents to live.

It's Boot-Camp Time 

Leading You to an Active Healthy Living 



By Joshua Collins 

Fitness Columnist 



One of the best ways to train muscles 
is by doing circuit training. 

Circuit training is where you take 
multiple exercises and do them 
consecutively with no breaks in 
between each exercise. This is the best 
for muscle endurance and toning and 
can be thrown in a couple days a week 
instead of your regular workouts. 

My boot-camps entail five upper 
body and five lower body exercises 
mixed in together and they are all free- 
weight and body weight exercises. 
You complete one set of every exercise 
with repetitions of fifteen, then you 
can take a one minuie break. Then 
repeal again for your second and 
third set. 

Once you've completed those three 
sels, you move on to complete an ab 
circuit. This includes five ab exercises 
completing one set of each with 
repetitionsoftwenty for each exercise. 
Then you break for one minute and 
repeat all over two more limes. 

This is a full body workout, getting 
your upper, lower, abs and cardio all 
in one 45 minute workout and you're 
done. 

! push this type or workout as much 
as I can because it's great for muscle 
endurance and loning. Also, by 
changing the exercises every couple 
weeks prevents plateau. 

Plateau is where someone does the 
same workout for like two months 
and then they notice that their bodies 
are not changing anymore and are 
just Slaying the same. This happens 
because your muscles are use to 
doing the same thing over and over 
and you don't gain or lose anything, 
just remain the same. This is where 
you need to incorporate what is called 
■'muscle confusion, " where you keep 
working the same muscles but in. 
different ways. 

This should be done every week to 
prevent plateau. 

An example of this would be instead 
of doing bench press for your chest, 
do a chest Hy \vith dumbbells. This 
still works the chesl, bul different 
parts and in a difTereni motion, thus 
causing the muscles to be confused 
with the motion so they break down 
and get stronger. 




Born and raised in Ontario, 
Canada, Joshua Collins 
graduated from IPFW in spring 
of 2008 where he majored In 
General Studies and minored 
in Psychology. While at IPFW, 
he played volleyball and made 
two Final Four appearances, 
capturing a 2nd place finish at 
the 2007 NCAA championships. 
He was certified through 
the International Sports &amp; 
Sciences Association (ISSA) 
in the summer of 2007 and i§ 
currently the head Personal 
Trainer at American Fitness 
here in Fort Wayne. His focus 
is on circuit training and 
specializes in running "boot 
camp" style workouts. Read 
more on boot camps in articles 
to follow. He is able to design 
workout programs, and diet 
plans specifically for any 
individual. He can train anyone 
to reach their personal goals 
whether it is to lose weight, 
gain muscle mass and strength 
o r tone up. 

Confusing a muscle is the best way 
to train so they don't know what to 
expect. 

Incorporating different exercises 
into your boot-camps each week will 
allow you to take your training to a 
whole new level and prevent muscle 
plateau. 

Anyone interested in a boot-camp 
session with me or a program to be 
developed should contact me at:

Struggling Mastodons prevail 
in weekend Invitational finale 



By Dan Vance 

Sporli Ed'rtor 



An early season of struggle ended Saturday night 
for the women's volleyball team with a 3-0 win over 
Murray State. The win came after five consecutive 
losses to start the season for (he women. 

After dropping all three matches in the season 
opening Invitational, the team lost their first two in 
this past weekend's Belmont Invitational to Furman 
(0-3) and the host Bruins (1-3). 

lessica Miller hit strong in the Invitational finale 
vtrith 14 kills and a .345 hitting percentage. It was 
her second straight match that the senior posted a 
personal season high. She also posted 10 digs in the 
win. 

The Mastodons hit strong in the opening game, 
ivinning 25-18, followed by games of 25-22 and 25- 
21. After not trailing ever in the opening game, the 
Mastodons rallied off five straight points to start game 
two, but still found themselves trailing 20-18 late 
before IPFW rallied. 

Ashley Dillon was 
also crucial on the 
offensive end with 
12 kills. Defensively, 
Rebekah Roehm, lamie 
Schwartz and Miller 
tallied up double-digit 
digs with 15, 13 and 10 
respectively. 

The women had opened their weekend on Friday 
night with a 21-25, 17-25, 22-25 loss to the l-ad\' 
PaladinsofFurman.lPFVVIedgameone2-0 and garni.' 
two 3-0 but never could get on real steady ground. In 
game three, they kept it within four points but never

"Soccer has always been strong in Fort Wayne. 
It's been a matter of getting the good players to stay 
here," Harper said. 

The localization of the team is something quite new. 
V\'hile they have carried many Fort Wayne players in 
the past, as well as players from surrounding states, 
the men's program has also been one with extreme 
recruiting depth. That has changed a lot this season 
as there are just Iavo players on the rosier not from 
Indiana, Michigan or Ohio and just one of those. 
senior Aaron TUUoch is an international player. 

Pan of that recruiting change is due to budget, but 
Harpers says they are recruiting better in-city. 

The addition of Pfeiffer will be key to all recruiting 
roles. A former professional soccer player in several 
leagues, Pfeiffer started every game in his Mastodon 
career and knows the local players quite well. 

Wlien conference play rolls around at the end of the 
month, the Mastodons are not expected to compete 
much according to the preseason Summit League 
rankings which has them last, just behind Centenary. 
But the team has the chance to prove doubters wrong 
in making an instant conference impacL Their first 
four games see them play at UMKC and in Louisiana

Younger, localized team looks to contend in League amidst more program stability 



By Dan Vance 

Spom Editor 

One year ago, Ihe men's soccer 
team had way too many things to 
deal with. 

The Summit League was brand 
new, Torcing the team to switch 
conferences; something that the 
majority of their peers within 
the school did not fiave to adjust 
to. Likewise, only their female 
counterparts on the field had to 
adjust to a panialiy new system 
following the exit of longtime 
soccer coach Terry Stefankiewicz. 

2008 biings some new players, 
a new experienced assistant in 
Bronn Pfeiffcr, but it also brings 
a stability so welcomed into the 
program. 

After several years as the lead 
Stefankiewicz assistant, Harper 
look over the program and went 3- 
12-2, the best record since 20D4. 

"There wasn't much of a change 
for me personally," Harper said. 
"Thewaywe(heandStefankiewicz) 
had it structured we both both 
kind ofhad our own program. 

An 0-2-1 start in 2008 is not 



exacdywhat they want either. But, 
it does give hope lo a team who is 
showing that they can compete. 

Even with the rough starting 
record, they have tied Drake in an 
exhibition match, batded through 
two overtime's ivith tough Division 
(I opponent St. Joseph's and held a 
tight grasp on slate-rival Buder. 

All of these things point to 
the positive as they prepare for 
Summit League play starting 
September 27. 

More consistency comes in goal 
as senior Michael Knitter has 
played every minute as goalie 
for the Mastodons thus far this 
season. In 2007, he played just six 
games in goal while fellow senior 
Josh Howell played 12 games. 

It has been a consistent back and 
forth between the two for several 
years as they have competed back 
and forth for the spot. Wliile giving 
up eight goals thus far. Knitter 
has stopped 18 shots on goal and 
carries a .692 save percentage. 

"Our plan right now, unless 
something happens lo Michael is 
that he is our number one goalie 
and losh Howell wil redshiri and 




be our keeper next year," Harpei 

said. 

The team will also look 
to sophomore 
Ramirez when it comes 
to consistency. The 
fonvard was a Summit 
League All-2nd team 
honorce last year 
and has 
thus far in 2008. 

W 
CO n s isl e 
is a must, the 
Mastodons 
have garnered 
breaths of fresh 
air in both 
youth and local 
connect 
Those areas 

have done the 
Mastodons well. 

Freshman MaxToulette 
of Concordia High School 
leads the team with two 
in his only game. 

Toulelle, a native of Haiti, is one 
of nine Fort Wayne players on the 
rosier, indicating a rise in IPFW's
