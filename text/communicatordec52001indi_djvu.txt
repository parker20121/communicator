Onical poems "Vera Beach 
day" and "Upon Bccominga 
Senior Citizen" and said that 
each poem makes him feel sen- 
timental toward birthdays, 

"Vou wrilc poems when 
soDicIhing seems a lilllc catchy. 
a lilllc odd, in that moment of 
Ihe day," Updike said, adding 
that birthdays have provided 
inspiration for Ihe creation of a 
number of his poems. 

Commenting on his percep- 

judge age, Updike said he is 
gladearlycullures did not have 
movie stars who do not seem lo 
grow older, even though Ihey 
an- morlal like everyone else.

grandchildren are the curreni 
source for many of his ideas 



Concluding 




Alice the read ng, Updike 
answered audience members 
questions concerning his favonie 
works and the movie adapla- 
lion of his novel "Rabbit Run. '

Eroposed amendments lo IPFW's 
thical Guidelines for Computer

The amendments, lo be pro-

wording of several paragraphs in 
the guidehnes- 

Two new paragraphs to be 
added to Ihe guidelines include a 
call tor misuse ol the computers to

The committees proposed to 
add the lines, "The university 
strives lo maintain a quiet, library-

their lime productively and wllh 
minimal distractions. 

"Proper use of computer 
resources follows the same stan- 
dards of common sense and cour- 
tesy that govern Ihe use of other 
public facMilies. 

"Improper use violates those 
standards by infringing upon oth- 
ers' ability to fulfill their responsi- 
bilities. All inappropriate uses 
of computing resources should 
be reported lo proper aulhorilics 
for possible disciplinary action. "

so." the judges wrote in a slate- 
menl published on the web Site. 

"For proof. Bemd Fischer in 
1999 produced a phenomenally 
informative and interesting 
book about Albania. 

"The story of this country, in 
oneof the shadowiest comers of 
Europe, and its experience of 
war from the llalian invasion in 
April 1939 through the Battle of 
Tirana and the final German 
withdrawal in early 1945. has

one English language book and 
is unlikely to be lold so well 
ever again."

harms your body, you have every right lo do 
so. You should nol, however, impose the ill 
effects ol your right onto me, I do not want lo 
deal with Ihal annoyance every dav. 

You should be courteous lo olhcrs when 
you smoke. For those of you who are, I com- 
mend you. For those of you out there who are 
not. I condemn you. The EPA also slated, 
"Passive smoking is estimated by the EPA lo 
cause approKimately 3,000 lung cancer deaths 
in nonsmokers each year." 

That is a large number. Three thousand 
people die from secondhand smoke, [ also read 
thai smoke may linger m or ansund a building. 
That mearu Ihal the smoker may have been 
finished smoking for quile some time, but that 
same smoke is still having an effecl on people. 

1 am nol asking for a lot here. 1 would just 
like lo walk inlo Kelllcr Hall and nol have lo 
worry about being confronted by a 15-20 fool 
line of chain smokers, I know ihal I may be 



Itle loomucl&gt;, but 
problem lo take the minor |og 
around Ihe comer and smoke Ihere? 

I do nol wanl it lo sound like I hate smok- 
ers. I don'l mind people who smoke. 1 just 
don't like Ihe whole smoke pad o( it, II you 
could keep that smoke away from me, I would 
be totally cool. II you do decide lo light up 
around me. please be courlcous and reslrain 
yourself from blowing it in my face. 

Go ahead and smoke all you wish. Decide 
for yourself if you wanl loharm your body. 1 
have made my decision, so, in return, do not 



Hold your breath 2". 

I slarled smoking when I was in Junioi high. 
[ knew that smoking was bad for me. 1 knew thai 
it caused cancer I knew Ihal it would affect my 
alhlclic pcriormancc, but 1 continued lo do it 
anyivay. 

Here t am, eight years later — still smoking, t 
have witnessed Ihe damage done lo my lungs 
and bank account, but I really don't see myself 
stopping any lime soon. My habit may turn you 
olf — thai doesn't bother me. 

What bothers most smokers is being treated 
like some kind of criminal, because we are not: 
Smoking is a completely legal, personal choice. 

The Great American Smoke-Oul held by our 
school in Keltler Hall some lime ago is a good 
eiample of Dver7ealDus campaignmg. It is a great 
evcnl for those who wanl lo slop smoking and 
are looking for help quilting. However, Ihe ash- 
Iravs covered with trash bags and wrapped with 
police tape were a bit excessive, 

I felt sorry lor the poor guy who had lo 
sweep up ttu? cttra bulls thai were, no doubl, 
thrown on Ihe ground. The prcvaltnl poslcis oi a 
crispy, carbon-faced woman holdmg a cigarcUc 
would have been enough to gel Ihe message 

Here's a news (lash for you: Smokers under- 
stand the dancers associated wilb smoking— we 
choose lo smoke despite Ihese hazards. We don'l 
wanl lo break our addiclion and no amount of 
campaigning or harassment will be able lo slop 



and when we choose lo quit, we will lake 

necessary steps to do so. It may sound harsh, 
bul Ihafs the reality ol the situation. 

The only way I hat smoking could ever come 
close to being extmguished. would be if the gov- 
ernment made il illegal, and that my friends, will 
never happen. I'll lell you why. 

It's all about money. Since the truth about 
lobacco was revealed decades ago, Ihe cigarelle 
lax has been hiked up lo SI .50 m some places— 
nol lo menlion Ihe plelhora of lawsuits made 
against the lobacco induslry. 

Wen: lalking about hundreds of billions of 
dollars. You may Ihink thai Ihe money from 
these laxes and lawsuils goes lo aoli-smoking 
campaigns or to health care. The Irulh is Ihal 
only a very small percenlage goes to Ihese agen- 

The maiorily of Ihe money goes back into 
the federal and stale governments and helps lo 
reduce budget deficits, A small percentage of il 
actually goes inlo (gasp!) education. 

The controversy over lobacco puis polili- 
cians in on ideal situation. They can make Ihe 
public happy by promoling higher cieatelle la-ies 
and lawsuits. In relum. they gel hundreds of bil- 
lions of dollars to play around with. Isn't Ihal 

Who's fooling who here? The govemmeni 
really doesn'l wanl people lo stop smoking 
because that would do away with a wonderful 

Wiihout the lobacco mduslry. Ihe govem- 
meni would have lo lax Ihe resi ol America lo 



makeup for what smokers provide. This 
would not be nearly as popular as lading 
Ihosc awlul smokers. 

Also, if cigarelles were oullawed, Ihey 
would jusl be smuggled m and sold like 
marijuana and cocaine are now. This equals 
more money for drug dealers and less 
money for ihe government. This is nol an 
equation Ihal politicians like lo see, 

Nol lo menlion Ihal if lobacco producis 
were made illegal, ihese polilicians wouldn'l 
be able lo smoke or do even less acccplable 
things with their overpriced, imported 
cigars (Bill Clinlon comes lo mind). 

You would have to live in a cave lo not 
know that cigarettes cause cancer and Ihal 
Ihe lobacco induslry lied lo Ihe public aboul 
Ihe dangers lor years. This is nol nevv inlor- 
m a lion to anyone. 

Had Ihe lobacco induslry been shut 
down when Ihe truth aboul smokingwas 
revealed, we would honestly be able to say Ihal 
our governmcnl is concerned with our health. 
Instead, Ihe tobacco induslry has just lumed into 
onemoresourceof revenue for our govemmeni. 
A lot more goes inlo Ihe "Irulh" aboul lobacco 
than many of us ever considered. 

All we can do is inform our children and try 
to lead by example. If Ihey choose lo smoke as an 
'adult, there's not much we can do. As long as il 
is legal, people ivill smoke cigarettes. As long as 
there is a spirit of independence and rebellion 
among youth, they will continue lo lighl up. 
These two factors will conlmue lo creale a steady 
supply ol new smokers.

low. repetitive strumming sparked my interest. As lead

kind of a CD Ihis was going to be. Then Ihe guiLir broki.'

One l&gt;Tic jumped out at me then and slill strikes me. 
In "Sigrw," Stapp sings, 'Comi" with mf. come with mt, come

This weekend, I saw a giant replica of Frosty Ihc 
Snowman ivhile up at Hamillon Lake. As I look a picture 
of a local band in front of Frosty. 1 began lo wonder exact- 
ly what it was that Frosty stood for. 

brief moment of Ihoughl, 1 decided that 
FiDsly was a sign of Xmos. But what exactly Is Xmas? To 
be precise, it is Chfislmas with a generic leplaccmcnl for 
Christ. 

t sure if I can understand celebrating Ihc birth 
and then remove Hini from the holiday. Thai 
is the equivalent of removing Cojumbus from Columbus 
Day. So 1 guess Ihal (vould become Xday. 

Chrishnas is a holiday lo remember ihe birih of Jesu! 
Christ. It's not a celebration o(Frosly,Santa and llic (oggy 
ight Rudolph ted Ihe sleigh with his brightly shining 
OSK. 

How would you feel if, on your next birthday, no 
ne celebrated your birth? Whal good would Ihe celebra- 
tion of your birthday be if we celebrated the day, and not 
your blrlh? It would be poinlless. Every day would be 

Xday, notto be confused with Columbus' 
Xday. 

Likewise, a celebration of -Xmas is poinlle&amp;s. If you 
don't believe that Jesus is the Son ol Cod and the Christ, 
then by all means, don't cclcbraie it. 

If you feel you must celebrate Christmas lo fit inlo 
practice here in Ihe United Stales at the risk 
jl on something, perhaps you are missing 



Belief in Jesus as the Christ brings unbelievable 
enjoyment and prosperity, far beyond human understand- 
ing. Above all. belief in Jesus as the Christ grants you 
eternal securi^ in Heaven. 

As 1 joyfully celebrate the awesome and wonderful

Isurcif youcan truly celebrate Ihebitlh of Jesus

There arc many more imporlanl issues (or 
us to worry aboul righl now. Leave smokers 
alone. We're nol trying to bother anyone. With all 
ol Ihis talk about acceptance and understanding, 
smokers have been overlooked. Don't tell the 
people you see smoking Ihal Ihey could gel can-

Memories of a managing editor

learned a lot these past few months.

daunted by Ihc dubious idea that I can'l

to agree with that. 

My wnling isn't anything special. 1 
jusl type out whatever is on my mind- 1 
can't use claboralc wording or use some 
special means of writing — T don't know 

ist over a year ago. I began my 
at The Communicator as a staff 
writer and moved on to become sports 
editor. Writing Ihi^ sports section was fun 
and entertainmg, but caruiol compare to 
the thrill of being managing editor. 

As managing editor, I got lo write 
about whalever subgect provoked me that 
week. If something didn't make sense lo 
me, I wrole about it. 

I have learned a bit more about peo- 
ple this semester. Sometimes people had 
a problem with me personally, simply 
because our opinions differed. 

I like lo think I'm a nice guy and 1 
really have a hard lime with people who 
don't like me. simply because of my 
opinion. Thai is just hard for me lo grasp. 



For those ol \

And il you're wondering, the man-

student and gel pushed around jusl like 
you do. Al times. I have witncs,scd my

however, have its advantaees People

Cfiris Tatterson of 'MuCticuCturaC 
Services ancC tfie history dej)artment 



December 5. 2001 



Dweribing whjl makes Chris PallersDn.in 
etctWenX educator is Iruly an exercise in scK- 
rcslrafnl: how maoy adicctivcs musl be cul. in 
order lo remain credible, when describing some- 
one whose working style is rclreshing, responsi- 
ble .indievolulionaryT As Dirctlor o( 
Muilicullural Services and Associate Pro/cssor of 
History, Patterson's five-year tenure includes 
such hits as broadening the 
depth and seope o( MullicuKural Services, irwli- 
luling and upholding the Summer Bridge pro- 
gram, opening doors lo graduale school for 
minority students and educating the general pub- 
lic on current alfairs which ailccl us all. 

While these accomplishments arc part ol a 
longer, more generous resume, what marks her as 
outstjnding is the way in which she accom- 
plished those goals. Alter completing doctoral 
work at Peniwylvania State University, Patterson 
embarked on a career at IPFW in which her 
poignant, astute observations and sharpened 
communication skills would be maximized for 
the benefit of thousands. Her dedication to the 
truth, along with a willingness to listen to others. 
' h.is shaped the minds o( many students whose 



largely have been solely influenced by the mass 

Also setting her apart is the lad that her 
"students" are those with whom she mteracts 
tioth in.side and outside the classroom. Nary a 
person walks away from this educator without 
having le.imed, or at the least contemplated, 
something they might not have known before. 
She asks you lo question your assumptions and 
values, and the premises upon which both have 
been shaped. In so doing, she encourages critical 
analysis and thinking skills in settings beyond 
textbook cases. Her instruction and wisdom are 
both practical and salient, her demeanor refined 
and her concern genuine. 

Most remarkable about Patterson is the 
approachable, open style of teaching that brings 
others to her. for correction, direction and confir- 
mation. It is difficult to imagine a situation in 
which she would be uncomfortable approaching 
or addressing what some would consider contro- 
versial, and even more difficult lo imagine her 
shyuig away from the opportunity Without being 
haughty, she tackles topics she is capable of 
unpacking and acknowledges those things with 
which •^hc v^ nol 50 (.imillar in tTmple. recogniza- 




ble language. 

From this, others glean that Patterson's 
character is not limited to only those areas in 
which she's well-versed, but entcnds lo the 
bnsader, more pertinent levels in which a per-

Shopping for something 
different? Try these alternatives 



By Kristin Partridge, Guest Writer

; still s 



erovim significantly, there 
things that just aren't available. In thi 
nearby vicinity exist many allcrnalive 
places to shop which might have just what 
you're looking for. 

It's possible to turn a shopping excur- 
sion into a fun little day trip, or for those 
avid shoppers, stay ovemighl and turn it 
into a mini-vacation. 

Roughly two hours south of Fort 
Wayne is Indianapolis, the great mccca ol 
shopping in the slate of Indiana. 
Indianapolis has six large shopping cen- 
ters, one being Casllcton Square Mall 

While reminiscent of Glenbrook, 
Caslleton Square has many other options 
to oiler Out of the 13D-plus stores, there 
arc the obligatory Bath Sc Body Works, 
Footlocker and Sears. However, Caslleton 
Square offers many other stoivs not found 
in Fort Wayne, such as Galyan's, a sporling 
goods store, Galyan's has everything Irom 
the usual sports -related items like baseball 
Kits and football helmets to equipment for 
more extreme sports such as kayaking, hik- 
ing and biking. 

For those ladies who love clothes, 
Delia's is Ihe place to go. Delia's is a con- 
temporary woman's clolhing store that 
sells trendy clothes lor a reasonable price. 

Chances arc, if you dig tX'lia's, you 
will love Dry Ice. Dry Ice is a shop special- 
izing in outrageous gills and knick-knacks 
such as candle holders and picture frames. 
Dry Ice also offers household ilcrns such as 
chairs and bath accessories with 

Along with the more typical dep: 
menl stores like LS Ayres and J.C. Penr 
Caslleton Square also oilers Lizarus .^ 



Von Maur. Other stores in Casltclon Square 
include an entire store devoted lo Fossil 
watches, clothing and accessories; The 
White Bam Candle Company and Build-A- 
Bear. where you can design your very ow'n 
leddy bear. 

One downfall ol Castlelon Square 
Nfall is the food court. There are few 
options available, however, TGI Friday's 
and Red Robin are located inside the mall 
and many other good sit-down restaurants 
surround the mall. The eating at Johnny 
Rocket's makes up lor the lack of a decent 
food court, _

The P.iu't - l'..r,„. I ..,:n 
devoted to the Indian 
Athlete's Foot shoe ston 
arcade for kids and those 

Anchoring Circle Centre Mall is 
Nordstrom's department store. Much like 
U.S. Ayres and Von Maur. Nordstrom's 
offers both the very finest name brands in 
clothing, shoes, housewares and cosmetics, 
as well as some moderately priced Items. 
In addition, about a block away from Circle 
Centre Mall is a large Old Navy store pro- 
viding a much larger selection than the 
ones in Foci Wayne. 

Another good mall in Indianapolis is 
The Fashion Mall at Keystone and Ihe 
Crossing. This mall includes more "high- 
end" stores such as The Pollery Barn. 

I Ashley and Coach. The Fashion Mall 
. most of wliich arc not 
found in Fort Wayne.

goods from ''■ — ^ '■'-■• ''~~-~ ' ' - 



prices demanded, look no further than 
Indiana's outlet stores. Three outlet slores 
arc within a short driving distance ol Fort 
Wayne. Ihe closest beingThe Prime Outlets 
in Krecmont, Ind. Close lo Lnke lames in 
Angola, this outlet mall is only about an 
hour's drive and is easily accessible from 
Interstate 69. The Prime Gullets include 
outlet stores Irom Nautica, The Gap, Ralph 
Lauren and Corning Revere. 

Another outlet mall located slightly 
farther from Fort Wayne is The Lighthouse 
Place Shops in Michigan City, Ind. It takes 
about two and a half hours to get there, but 
Ihcsavingsalsloresslichas J. CrcwOudel 
Store are. unbelievable. Other stores 
include Li?. Claiborne, Tommy 



md Donna Karan. II is the 



Crate and 

largest outlet mall in Indiana, with a 

100 shops. 

If you are on your way to Indy and 
want lo snag some good deals before you 
get there, the Indiana Factory Shops arc 
located just off of Highway 69. just Doforc 

fou re.ich Indianapolis. Tenants at Indiana 
actory Shops include Mikasa Crystal, 
Casual Comer and Rack Room Shoes. 

These arc onlv a lew ol the many 
malls located a short drive from Fort, 
Wayne. Indianapolis alone has at least six 
large shopping malls, each with something 
dillerent lo oiler. 

Remember, while mi

'Weathered/ but not withered 



iliddleton. SlafI Writer 



On that day, a band was made — a 
band with inlelligence. ambition 
and energy, A band that was 
going to push all doubt and dis- 
couraging 4vords aside. 

"Hicy did just that. They set 
aside all Ihe non-believers and set 
out to show what they were real- 
ly made ol. Thny released a CD 
called "My Own Prison, " which 
was met with a great deal ol suc- 

I am talking about the band 
Creed. Creed was the first band in 
history to have lour number one 
rock radio singles from a debut 
album — a leat even more impres- 
sive in these days of love 'cm and 
leave 'em. one-hit wonders. 

There was some doubt as to 
Iheir ability to achieve similar 
success with future efforts, but 
Creed proved critics wrong with 
the release of their third album, 
"Weathered." I would not be sur- 
prised if this band surpassed 
their record of number one, chart- 
lopping songs on a single CD. 

"VVealhcred" has another 
solid line-up that will blow you 
away as completely as the last 
two CDs did. 

With such songs as, 
"Bullets." "Freedom Fighter," 
"Signs," "Weathered" and 
"Hide," you can bet they will 
compete strongly with the ellorls 



ol other artists. 

"Weathered" provides 
combination ol music that wi 



ally slides into a slow, quiet gui- 
tar message that eventually 
morphs into a rough, head bang- 
ing sound that will blow you 

If you enjoy creative lyrics, 
ballads or slow, beautifully ren- 
dered songs, this is a CD that will 
meet all ol your needs. There is 
something to lit any mood or 
mindset. 

1 would highly recommend 
going . out and buying 
■■Weathered." This is not a CD 
that should be put on hold so that 
you can gel the right download 
olf of Ihe computer. Plus, what 
better way to gel all Ihe lyrics so 
thai you can sing along? 

There is no belter way to 
etplain the CD than to let it speak 
for itself. Lead singer Scott Stapp 



said it best ir 



"BulTel 



■Hey, all I 
Somelliing I ciiit loiicli and can feel. 
I'll hold close and nfwr let it go. " 

t thought those same words 
as 1 listened to this CD. II the 
album's current sales mean any- 
thing, you will probably feel the 
same as you listen lo Creed's lat- 
est, "Weathered."

"The Big Cookie" chronicles Ihe story of insecu™ 

BEople trying to be something they're nol. 
rawing on tne exploits of himself and friends, 
Wally episodically takes the reader through the 
sometimes humiliating and often hilarious high- 
lights ol Iheir pursuit of the perfect males. 

The novel is similar to "Sex and the City" or 
"Bridget Jones's Diary" in its frank, humorous 
treatment ol Ihe problems its protagonists face in 
search of commilled. meaningful relationships. 

Being single is scary lor many people, how- 
ever. Ihe mild anxiety most people associate with 
dating balloons into full-blow'n terror for Wally.

Ihat he will die alone if he doesn't find a wife by

for his problems.Onco he repairs ha own shoddy

ness in life and love.

and nall-biliog /inal plays. Many analysis 
have dubbed Ihe Bean' season this year as 
simply ii siring of luck.

Allef losing Iheir opening game lo Ihe 
delcnding Super Bowl Champion 
Balliinore Ravens, Ihe Bean rallied againsi 
Ihe Minnesota Vikings lo win by a louch- 
down. Backup QB Jim Miller, nilcd m well 
lor in|ured starter Shane Mallhcws, 

The following week, Ihe Bears Itaveled 
lo Atlanta and pulled olf an impressive vic- 
tory over top draft pick QB Michael Vick 
and Ihe Falcons. 31-3. 

An/ona proved to be a tougher oppo- 
nent, tflkine Ihe lead early Once again, 
Chicago's oc/cnse made the greal plays, 
winning by only one iouchdown, 20-13, 
Hears cornerback R.W. McQunrtcrs 
picked up a fumble in the second half and 
relumed it 69 vards lo seal Ihe win. 

Tlie Bears' cicfense proved lo be no fluke 
as Chicago shut oul Cincinnati. 24-0- Tlie 
Bears' defense held Bengal star running- 
bacl. Corey Dillon for minimal yards. 

Week seven saw another of tnis season's 
surprise teams visit Soldier Field. Ihe San 
Francisco 49crs, The 49crs had nol visited 
Chicigo since the 1988 NFC title game and 



thu game proved to be another great one. 
Coming off of a deflected pass by San 
Francisco QB Jeff Garna. Chicago safely 
Mike Brown relumed an interception dur- 
ing overtime to give the Bears the come- 
back victory, 37-31. 

If you thought lhC'l9ers game was good, 
Ihe Bears played a real thriller one week 
later against another surprise team, the 
Cleveland Brovviu. Quarterback Mallhcws 
was back in Ihestarling lineup, this lime as 
s backup to the now injured Miller, who 
had been having an excelleni season, 
Matthews Ihrcw a 34-yard Hail Mary 
touchdown and one more TD in the closing 
minutes of Ihe fourth quarter. Brown once 
again deflected a pass and relumed an 
interception in overtime lo give the Bears 
the win. 27-21. 



Gramatica hit Ihe post wide on the game's 
final play thai would have put the game 
inio overtime. Chicago won 27-24. 

Alter anolher viclory over division foe

Chicago, desperately searching lor their 
first win, II looked as if it would finally 
come as the Lions posted an early lead, but 
again, the Bears were saved by

Chicago Coach Dick Juaron doesn't 
mind bein^ labeled lucky, as long as Ihey 
are still winning. However, the Bears are 
proving that there Is more talent Ihan luck 
on this football team. 



The Bears tough defense is led by mid- 
dle linebacker Brian Uriacher. Uibcher and 
Ihe rest ol the Bears' pnmary core have 
forced lumovers. stopped Ihe run and lal- 



againsl Ihe pass with comcrbacks 
McQuarters and Tony Parrish. Brov/n has 
returned two game-winning interceptions. 
Both Miller and Matthews have done 
well in backing up each other during 
in|urics. Both have hooked up with 
receivers Marty Booker. Marcus Robiruon 
and rookie David Terrell for hie plays. 
Competing backs James Allen and rookie 
Anthony "Thomas have made the slarting 
runningb.ick position a see-saw batlte. Both 
have run more major yardage this season. 
Obviously, the talent is in Chicago this 
season. Luck can't last forever and usually 
doesn't win nine games in 12 ivecks of play. 
The Bears have a commanding lead over 
the Green Bay Packers in the I^TFC Central 
Division. 

All of you Chicago fans can come oul of 
your shells now. We may see anolher Super

The wide receiver for ihe 
Minnesota Vikings was quoted as say- 
ing, "Nobody can make me play. I play 
when 1 ivant to play." 

This is the same player who signed

game of Ihe season? 

It's not just Moss who is doing it 
though; most ol the players are guilty. I 
saw a guy celebrate a sack down, 28-0. 
His team was getting killed and because 
he happened lo get a sack, he took the 
lime oul to do a little dance and get the 
atlcntian of the cameras. 



Why do you foci the need to cele- 
brate afler every play? This is your job.

scored, a player spikes the ball and 
starts a dance. When his teammates |oin

What happened to a simpler time? What 
happened to the Barry Sanders, the

When these guys made a big play, 
Ihey got up and went back to the mid-

The Notre Dame football 

§' breathed a huge sigh of relief on

Head Coach Bob Davie and his staff 
were being fired.

Davie Finds no 
Luck with Irish 



Athletic Director Kbvin While stood up 
in front of America and told everyone 
Ihat Bob Davie was gone, he put an end 
loanera, (or which many Irish fans were 
thankful. I have lo admit, when I heard 
the news that Davie was gone. I almost 
did a little dance. 

I was so excited that ND could 
bring in a real co.ich. someone who 
could gel ND back on lop. Someone like 
Jon Gniden. 

Upon furlher review, however, I 
actually fell bad that Coach Davie was 
gone. After all is said and done, I think 
Dai'ie should be remembered for more 



on the academic side ol the fence, as the 
sport ,or money side, became more 
important. 

Notre Dame is a prestigious univer- 
sity with high expectations for its stu- 
dents. Dfivic met Ihose expectations. 
As I looked closer into the firing. 1 saw 
some Ihmgs that were Davie's fault and 
many things Ihat were nol. 

Let me take you back to 1997. 
Davie was taking over a program that 
even Ihe most devoted Irish fan will tell 
you was on Ihe way down. The Irish 
hadn't been lo a boivl game for three 



dards were lowered so he could get the 
players he wanted. Coach Davie would 
nave no such luck. 

With academic standards more 
strongly enforced, Davie still managed 
Id get belter lalcnl than the team had 
seen since the Rick Meier and Jerome 
Bettis days. The problem was he didn't 
know what to do with it. Poor calls, bad 
clock management and an offcase that, 
to this day. has not found an identity, 
were things that directly reflected on 
head coaching. It doesn't seem like 
Davie had a lack ol preparation. 



There were greal moments for the 
school also. Like 1998. when the Irish 
knocked off the nilh-ralcd team in the 
country, a team Ihat was coming off a 
Vialional championship season. The Irish 
put them to bed that day by scoring 30 
second half paints. There was also last 
year, when the Irish weni 9-2 in the reg- 
ular season, at one point tvinning seven 
in a rotv to get lo a BCS bowl game. 

However, Ihe lows outnumbered 
the highs. During Davie's tenure, ND 

national lille and in one dismal 1999 sea- 
son, poor clock management led to at 
least two losses in the waning seconds 
against rival Michigan and Purdue, 

In the end, Davie was done in by 
one thing and that was a lack of head 
coaching experience. However, when 
he was at Notre Dame, he brought 
respect lo the school. 

When did schools gel more into 
winning and less into academics? Yes. il

lU officials outline plans for possible budget cuts 



bLOOMINGTON. Ind — 
On Thiirsd,iy, Nov, 29, Indiana 
Univefiily oKicijls announced 
a Mtiei of Mepi Ihal Ihc uni- 
versily is raking lo prepare (or 
pOMiDle budget cuts. 

The university will delay 
erforls lo nil sdministrallve 
and sla(( vacancies; reduce 
spending on travel, suoplies 
and cauipmcnl and will con- 
sider Ihe imposilion of a tem- 
porary Ice on students neit 
year lo make up for losses in 
technology funding from Ihe 
stale. Specific sicps will be 
undertaken at a local levi-1 
based on decisions made by 
campus chancellors and vice 

President Myles Brand 
stressed Ihal Ihe universily, in 
crealinR ils budgel conlin- 
gcncv plans, will make every 



elforl to protect Ihe academic 
mission and the academic 

Universily. More than 75 per- 
cent of any cut* will come 
from administrative areas 
university-wide, 

'Indiana's research univer- 
sities must play a key role in 
building a stronger, more 
resilient economy in our stale 
—through both education and 
research. Wc must not allow 
that effort to be undermined 
by short-term budgetary 
problems." Brand said. 

Final decisions on most 
budgel reductions and on 
tuition and fee levels for the 
2002-03 academic year will 
not be made until there is a 
dearer signal from the stale 






&gt;ntin 



gt^ncy planning will begin 
based upon the croposals 
announced earlier Ihis month 
by Governor Frank O'Bannon. 
The contingency planning 

Erocess for each campus will 
e led by the campus chancel- 
lor. Each campus will be given 
a budget rcduclion goal and 
will be allowed flexibility on 
the best way to achieve it. 
That process will be moni- 
tored by Vice President and 
Chief Financial Officer Judith 
Palmer and is expected to be 
completed by early 2002, 

As a result of the reduc- 
tions outlined in the gover- 
nor's budget-balancing plan 
and Ihc reductions in funding 
levels previously approved by 
Ihc legislature in enacting the 
2001-03 biennial budget, the

the budget also included sig- 
nificant reductions in higher 
education funding for repair 
and rehabilitation of build- 
ines and for information tech- 
nology. In addition, one month- 
ly payment of stale operating 
appropriations lo lU was 
delayed for an indefinite peri-

in Ihe plan. 

As a result, the repair and 
rehabilitation appropriation 
would be about 37.5 percent 
of the previous blennium's, 
while the appropriation for 
information technology would 
be cut by about 66 percent 
from the previous budget, 

Indiana University, which 
educates more than 96.000 
students on ils eight campus- 
es statewide, is the fourth 
largest employer in the state. 

Brand said that, while he 
does not expect widespread 
layoffs as a result of the budget 



cuts. |Obs funded through Ihc

ings may be achieved by not
