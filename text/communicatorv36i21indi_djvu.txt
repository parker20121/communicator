If there is a large enough number of

"We have paid for services

Colbert explained, "services

Colbert likened IPFW's situ-

campuses to that of the 13 colo- 
nies before the revolutionary 
war, taxation and all. That is 
why many want a change. 

But what has stoked the fire 
under this discussion seeming- 
ly all or the sudden within the 
last year? 

One of the reasons is that 
IPFW celebrated its 40th anni-

the makeup of the university 
has changed over those years.

Album Review 






Hasement Whan' li.is been quite an admired

Podium 



Challenge issued to U.S. 
mainstream media outlets 

Screaming from the Left 



[ would like to take this moment 
to address the issue of the offensive 
Muslim cartoons that have been driving 
the news and creating headlines. 

First and foremost, i want to address 
what I consider to be the options that 
the mainstream media is ignoring. 
Let us waste no more time in flowery 
introductions. 

Firstly, I wan! hi address this idea that 
these cartoons are "deeply offensive" to 
Muslims. That is very much true, no 
doubl.and the Koran does state to never 
make an idol of (he prophet. 

1 would like to take this moment to 



Mi, 11 i 



Sim 



Mich as the "piss Christ" incident. 

Furthermore, is it not "deeply 
offensive" to make cartoons that depict 
Anne Frank in a bedroom post-coitus 
with Adolf Hitler? 

Has the fact that this is "deeply 
offensive" stopped Iranian newspapers 
from publishing such imagery? Have 
any embassies been burned down in 
response to them? 

Lastly, on that note, 1 find it "deeply 
offensive" that human lives have been 
taken in the name of a series of cartoons. 
More people should be outraged thai 
lives have ended over this issue. That 
is the most offensive, and should be, in 
this whole debacle. 

Secondly, let us continue to address 
this idea that it is "deeply offensive." 
At what point will the media admit 
the exception was made, not to offend 
Muslims, inn out of fear of reprisal. 

Not only is this an ugly stereotyping, 
that when you insult Islam they kill 



Tile American press, for the most 
ban. seems to have been cowed by fear. 

Third, and finally, let us took at this 
idea that you can cover the whole story 
without posting the .u 1u.1l cartoons. 

That is just not true 

The whole story cannot be told 
without the image, for merely hearing 
about some "offensive cartoons" the 
mind is made to wander. 

If one cannot see the actual issue 
at hand, they ate forced to jump to 
conclusions abool tin- actual content. 

Further, if the news could be delivered 
without images, why print any at all? 
Impact is hased on image- 
Would the Katnna disaster have had 
the impact ori the nation without those 
pictures? What is the news without 
image? What is the news without the 
ability to see first-hand the cause and

Olympics lack competitive interest 



Staff Editorial 



The Olympics just aren't 
the same anymore. 

In fact, the ratings for 
prime-time television at 
Turin are down 50 percent 
since Salt Lake City. 

Other networks are 
creating more competition 
with the Olympics to gain 
the prime-time television 
viewers. Fox's American 
Idol is beating the Olympics 

27 million people watched 
American Idol one night, 
compared to the 16.1 million 
viewers tuning in to the 
Olympics. 

ABC's hit "Lost" along with 
CBS's "Survivor" and "CSI" 
also draw viewers away from 
the Olympics. 

turning away from the 



Olympics? 

One possible reason could 
be the quality of American 
performances is dropping. 

For example, snowboarder 
Lindsey Jacobellis. She had 
a gold medal right in front of 
her. But, could she just finish 
the competition and then 
celebrate? No, she had to try 
to do a fancy, show-off trick 
and wiped out, costing her 
the renowned gold medal. 
She's lucky she managed to 
recover and earn the silver. 

Her response: "I messed 
up, Oh well. It happens." 

How embarrassing. 

America has also lost their 
sweetheart, Michelle Kwan. 

Kwan was forced to pull 
out of the games early, due to 
a training injury. 

For fans of the ice skating 



competition, this was an 
utter disappointment. 
Supposedly, her skating was 
to attract millions of viewers. 
Then, looking away from 

- the Austrian drug scandal. 
Police found over 100 
syringes and over 30 drugs 
in the Austrian Olympic base 
in the first raid. What was in 
those syringes is unknown- 
for the time being. 

The athletes did take drug 

There is also speculation 
that viewership is down due 
to the lack of epic contest 
between the Soviet Union 
and America. 

It is likely that viewers 
will continue to watch and 
vote for their Idols and forget 
about those in Turino.

Justin Kenny should take the time to consider the

Perhaps he felt that the use of uncouth language

unprofessional, and dim 1 nisi ies his 1 redihility as a serious

In one of his philosophy classes Christopher Cosans recently

"believe is true." He asserted this fanlv casually, and according to

Americans show greed; profit through death 



By Damon Andrews 



does not remarry for 10 years will only 
receive $153,286 (and that's even before 

taxes). That's not even 13 percent of the 
overage payout for 



(U-WIRE) CLEMSON. S.C. - We all 
vents that took 
2001. We can all 

s released, just as our parents can 
tr where they were when the news 
that John F. Kennedy had been shot and 
killed was made public. 

It's something that is burned in us 
forever. But, would you go as far as to think 
that some people would try and make 
personal millions off the tragedy? Well, 



; of SI. 185 million 
from the government, with a minimum of 
5250,000, though as much as S4.7 million 
has been rewarded. Still, these close kin of 
those killed during the airplane strikes are 
complaining that the money for the death 
of their loved ones is just not enough. 

I'm not denying the horror or heartbreak 
that took place on 9/11, but for most 
people, they were merely in the wrong 
place at the wrong time and fell victim to 



r freedom. 

Does something seem wrong wi 
system? 

Now to anger me even further was tne 
fact that surviving family members of the 
Oklahoma City bombing have now created 
an organization petitioningforentitlements 
due to their losses. Are people really trying 
to profit off death? 

This disgusts me beyond belief. 

The new "craze" has also spread 
to families of those bombed in foreign 
embassies who are looking to receive 
considerable compensation. And now 
companies and industries as far away as 
the west coast are descending like vultures, 
saying that the 9/11 strike has hurt their 



month; however, people can serve as much 
as 20 years in the military and leave as 
an E-7, yet only receive $1,000 per month 
pension. 

So, the very people who are sending our 
soldiers to fight in wars are receiving up to 
$180,000 per year in pension whereas those 
military men and women who serve up to 
20 years may only receive SI 2,000. 

For a nation founded on blood and 
sweat, it would appear the blue collar 
worker is nearly expendable in this day 
and age. 

Both Congressmen and military 
servicemen are government employees, 
though it appears that the lives of men and 
women defending our country are worth 



To the soldiers in Iraq today, I would 
feel insulted by those people who are 
seeking compensation for the 9/11 tragedy. 
The message being sent by those who are 
looking for entitlements is 



The American people, though I do not 

like admitting it, are making our nation 

whole appear as a selfish and greedy 



i soldier who is killed in combat - an 
initial check of S6.000 (half of which is 
taxable), $1,750 for burial costs, S833 per 
month as a surviving spouse until you 
remarry, and $211 per month for every 



mother left with 1 



under the lid of a coffin. 

During my travels abroad, I have 
defended beyond end America, its policies, 
and its people. It vexes me greatly that 
not only have a few United States citizens 
given all Americans a bad name, but that 
our credibility as a nation driven by morals 
is shattered through our voracity and 
materialism. 

Now to add to my fury - Congressmen 
must only serve one term in Congress to 
receive a pension of up to S15,000 per 



The emergence oi these figures has not 
aused me to lose any faith in our nation 
or government - I still believe we live in 
the best country in the world, despite 
the few greedy people who tarnish the 



trying to profit off the death of our fellow 
countrymen in such a tragic incident. 

Moreover, it is nauseating to hear that 
people are trying to receive money for a 
bombing that happened over a decade 
ago. Not only does this appear selfish, but 
tenibly shallow to think that a price tag 
could be put on the life of a loved one.

Classic videogames 
more appealing 



Staff Column 



Last fall, for my birthday, my boyfriend bought me a Nintendo 
64. Yes. an old N64. That's what I wanted. I had never had one 
while I was growing up; we had a Sega. Maybe that was part of the 
reason lor always wanting an N64. 

And you know what. I love it. To some females this may sound 
unusual, but 1 actually like to play videogames. I think it might 
have something to do with the competitive drive in me. 

But, you may ask. why N64? Why not a newer system with 
new technology? Well, because the old N64 is better than newer 
gaming systems for many reasons, 

First off, all of the classic, hit games. 

Zelda - I really don't think that much more needs to be said 
besides that, but I will elaborate. In my eyes, Zelda is the best 
game ever created. It has a great story line and it was created so 
that people like me, who aren't .is skilled at videogames, can have 
just as much fun as extremely skilled people I he newer Zelda 
games just aren't as fun. Zelda, to me. was the first game that had 
real action-adventure to It. 

Moving on to other games, N64 has GoldenEye 007, It fs my 
favorite multiplayergamc. Some people rate this as the best game 
ever, but it rates second on my list. The single player game Is also 
one of my favorites. 

PerfectDark is another hit, along with the original Mario Party 
and Mario Karl. Banjo- Kazooic, although maybe based towards 
younger kids, is on my list of favorites, 

Star Fox and Super Mario 64 should not be left out. All of these 
games made N64 a hit. 

Second, N64 was the pioneer of the new gaming systems. It was 
the first to have awesome graphics. Sure, now graphics are better. 
but at the time, N64 graphics were the greatest and really, they still 
aren't that bad. 

They also took the next step with games, creating more games 
and there were more details in the games. Games began to look 
more "real" and have many different levels. 

Nintendo 64 started what we have today in gaming, 

Third, N64 is currently cheap to buy My boyfriend paid 
somewhere around $20 for mine at EB Games. Prices of games 
average from $2.99 to $19.99; the latter is the price of Mario Party 
2. I bought a rumble pack for S0.99! Compare that to the $400 
thai people were shelling out for the new XBOX and the Siil) games 



they have to buy and I think you will sec my point 

is kind of difficult to find the games that you want, but It's worth 

it when you do. 

Another reason that N64 is so much better is the fact that it 
uses canridges. This Is awesome because in most games, the 
game progress is usually stored in the actual cartridge instead of 
in memory cards. You have to pay extra for memory cards, but the 
cartridge is already there, 

Plus, N64 games load so much faster than games that use 
discs today. There aren't long wait screens that have "loading..." 
running across the bottom of the screen. 

Of course, cartridges arc more expensive to make, probably 
helping lead to their demise. 

The last reason that N64 is better has to do with the controller. 
The thing only has one analog sin k, thank goodness! New gaming 
systems have two analog sticks; loigei nviog to see where you arc 
going. Down is up, up is down; who knows what's going on! 

Simply put, in this case, older Is bener. 

Common college 
student mistakes 



By Elise Dillingham 

Dally Mississippi™ 
(U. Mississippi) 

(U-WIRE) OXFORD, Miss, - 
College students are sometimes 
prone to making mistakes. 

Whether it's turning in a 
paper late, sleeping through a 
class or having one too many 
drinks the night before an 8:00 

They're all risks to a student 
trying to graduate, but after 
interviewing students from 






list of the five 

mistakes made 

Money mismanagement: 
checking a 



It's easy to charge dinner, 
the cable bill, and few Wal-Mart 
trips and not realize how much 
has actually been spent. 

To control this, try to hold 
yourself to a daily or weekly 
spending limit so there won't be 
a surprise when the bill comes. 
With a checking account, we 
can sometimes be in a hurry and 

But the biggest problem 
(among those 1 spoke) is the 
debit card. Transactions aren't 
always posted immediately, so 
you could accidentally keep 



Be 



write all 

they happen, and balance your 
checkbook daily. 

Not getting involved: Many 
college graduates regret not 
taking pan in extra activities. 

There's more to Ole Miss 
than classes and parties, so 
take advantage of everything 



5 that will be useful i 
I the job search. 

I groups like Gospel 



organizations and student 
government groups. 

Try a professional 
organization related to your 
major. Fall sorority or fraternity 
recruitment is also a great way 
to get involved on campus. 

Partying too much; Almost 
everyone has done a little 
too much partying, but the 
concept is simple: when you 
know there's a history exam on 
Tuesday, don't go out partying 



weekend or a day off. 

Time mismanagement: 
Sometimes important class 
work likes to jump out of 
nowhere. 

Procrastipating, wasting 
time, and losing track of what's 
going on is a good way to get 
caught off guard. 

For example, girls: don't 
waste time hanging out in 
your friend's room down the 
hall trying to decide which 
fraternity has hotter guys when 
you should be preparing for 
tomorrow's biology test. 

Guys: wait until your 
studying is finished until you 
do whatever it is guys do. 

Putting all important 
dates on a calendar or setting 
reminders on a computer or 
cell phone is a simple way of 
keeping track of what's going 

Not taking class seriously 
enough; Class is the most 
important thing about college 
and it's why everyone is here. 

Remember that 10-point 
quizzes and smaller grades can 
be just as important as 100- 

More importantly, go to class. 
Professors are serious when 
they say not all information 
comes from either the book or 
lecture, so show up and listen. 

After all this, take into 
consideration what one 
graduate student told n

to make as few of the

EDITOR: Flemming Rose, the Danish

tion of cartoons depicting the Muslim 
prophet Muhammad triggered world- 
wide controversy, believes publication 
of the images was consistent with 
standards of press freedom in secular 
western societies. 



making reference to a grenade attack on a 
NATO base in Afghanistan. "That leads us to 
believe there is something else behind this." 

The protests now sweeping the world an? 
a strange animal. In Pakistan, Afghanis and 
Pakistanis gathered to protest. The Afghan 
crowd was enraged about outsourcing 
reconstruction to Pakistan and the Pakistanis 
began to protest against the United States, 
When the crowd encountered security forces 
outside a U.S. military base, a Taliban member 
in the crowd opened fire, tlulab Shah Alikhcil, 
the regional governor of the area, stated. "They 
[the mob] forgot all about the cartoons." 

And that is a common trend in these riots. 
The anger caused over the cartoons is used 
to gather the ground, but once the mob has 
formed individuals with ulterior motives take 
over the mob and redirect it to further their 
own aims. Even governments are using the 
mobs to push agendas that have nothing 
to do with the cartoons or the defense of 
Islam. Mulwi Sayed Imam Mutawali was 
reported as saying "There are some enemies 
of Afghanistan that want to take advantage 
of this issue. They just want to advance their 
own aims." Others worry that the violence 
is hurting Islam on the world stage, building 
a stereotype of Muslims being intolerant, 
inflexible and anarchic, ready to spring to 
violence at the drop of a hat. 

The moderate Muslim world is clearly 
not embracing the protests-turned-riots. As 
they continue to condemn the violence and 
those that would seek to turn the riots into 
instruments of dieir own gain, the extremist 
Muslim world is embracing the violence. 
The Islamic Defenders Front, a radical 
organization, said in the Washington Post that 









Middle l.asiern Muslims sec the War on Terror

at the lack of outrage in their home countries,

[I am] disappointed. It was a bad journalistic choice. My 
understanding of journalism is when you have something 
provocative, established as provocative, you use words 
to describe it instead of using the actual picture. The 
Communicator presented the article as news, not as publicity, 
which was the case. The cartoons used 60 percent of the page: 
it was all about the cartoons themselves. Inflaming, further 
inflaming a provocative situation. I don't think anyone wants 
to add to the problem; they don't want to give it [the Danish 
cartoons] credibility. By talking about it on either side, they will 
give it inertia and further misunderstanding. 

Lamar Dixon 

SGA President 



I believe that The Communicator is creating 
controversy by publishing the Danish cartoons. 
I support freedom of speech, and I am curious 
to see for myself the cartoons that offended 
millions of Muslims and launched international 
revolts. However, the provocative nature of the 
cartoons cannot be ignored. I am concerned 
that The Communicator's method of educating 
students about current events might be 
interpreted as insensitive. 

Merav Kanpol 
student 



I do not support the decision [to 
run the cartoons) but I support 
your right based on freedom of 
speech. A university is the best 
place to publish them and opens 
a dialog that will further respect, 
understanding and tolerance. 

Pam Shif ley 
student 

Solidarity with the free press is 
always good. People will finally get 
to see what the fervor is all about. 
I think any Islamic student, a small 
minority, would find it awkward to 
protest. Also, they would be more 
aware of the idea of a free press. 

James Lutz 
professor of politcal science 



I think it is terrific, very brave, 
of The Communicator, lam 
very impressed. Very few IPFW 
students read papers.., most 
would not know what you 
were talking about (the Danish 
cartoons]. International news 
is not as high a priority. 



Sophie Glaier 
professor of English 



I don't see anything wrong 
with it. There's nothing t 
different than jokes about 
other stuff or religions. 

Andy McMillan 
student 

[The Communicator] should be 
considerate of other religions. 
Christianity has been made 
fun of forever, but when you 
know that it will incite a riot 
I think you should think twice 
about it. [The Communicator

Mastodons shock Cardinals 

■ IPFW defeats #S Ball State and Mercyhurst to go above .500 in MWA conference play for the first rime 




Sophomore C.l. Mucins hail another 
strong weekend, compiling 59 kills in 
helping M'lW win their third and fourth 
straight matches, topping Ball State and 
Mercyhurst last weekend. 

On Friday night, the previously 
unbeaten Ball State Cardinals visited 
the Gates Center and fell 30-20, 35-33, 
28-30 and 30-24. 

The Cardinals came into the match 
ranked #8 nationally by the NCAA 
but were pounded from the get-go by 
Macias. who had 10 kills in the opening 
game and a match high 32 kills. The 
performance against Ball State followed 
a 34-kill night one week earlier against 
Quincy. 

"It was pretty much war." said M, it ins. 
"Everyone had been getting pumped for 
it all week. We knew they were going to 
come in here thinking they could stomp 



rperfect record, 
it was a good mix for everyone to be at 
the top of their game." 

IPFW jumped out to a 2-0 lead in a 

back-lo-back game two where Macias 
and Ball Stale's Nick Meyer battled back 
and forth. Meyer looked to be getting the 
last laugh while knocking down three of

added Macias. 

The Mastodons never trailed in the

attempt at a furious Lomcback. Macias 
ended the night with his 32" d kill to give 
IPFW the upset win. 

"Really the point that won was Mike

Wallace was on the basketball 

While at Lawrence North, 
Wallace was pan of a Wildcats 
team that became the first high 
school to win back-to-back 
Class 4A state titles in Indiana 
history and also played for 
legendary coach lack Keefer. 

Lawrence North had been 
a high-profile team for years, 
boasting nine Indiana All-Stars, 
a total that will likely grow to 
1 1 come the end of this season. 
And Wallace, he was part of that 
legacy, in the starting five his 
senior year and playing with 
the best and the brightest. 

It was, admittedly fnrWalluce. 
a long way from his humble 
beginnings in the sport. 

A football purist. Wallace 
first tried out for basketball in 
seventh grade and made the

"We were in the tunnel 
getting ready to come out and I 
saw Dave Simon and QC (junior 
Quintin Carouthers) and they 
had nice jackets on that said 
IPFW on the back and I was like 
'what is this?" 

So Wallace followed up his 
interest in what IPFW was about 
with some research, found out 
later in the spring that' Dane

kid knows that he will be back

With several Division II

the spring to replace the traditional track

season is for schools who do not have an 
established traditional season. It is for 
programs who do not have an organized

The NCAA allows programs with 
nontraditional seasons to take the 
program to five meets. The five meets

Fruchey is only allowed so many 
practice times throughout the entire 
year. He has to subtract the practice 
times already used in cross country 
before establishing practice times in the 
nontraditional season. 

Fruchey finds that the nontraditional

still represent the school since they 
still wear IPFW uniforms as opposed to 
running unattached. 

"It's great because the kids can still 
represent IPFW," commented Fruchey.

Since the men have meets, they still 
have something to work towards. They 
still have a goal. 

"They can keep working hard," said 
Fruchey. 

Fruchey has been approached by 
people inquiring about men being able 
to participate in the program. He said 
that he has had people asking if they 
could throw. Basically, he has had to 
turn them down. The nontraditional 
season is just for men's cross country 
since it's not like a club sport.
