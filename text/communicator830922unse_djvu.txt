Children paying 
for social cuts 



II seems mosi people love children. 

People exist who abuse children, bul 
those people are in (he minority. Most 
people would never knowing! v hurt a 
child 

Vet that is exactly what is done when 
uc support an administration and a 
congress that favors cutbacks in social 
programs 

Of the 32 million poor people in this 
country. 40 percent are children. II 
seems unreal that we! would support a 
president .who would hurt the poor 

Many peopleare in favor of cutting aid 
to the poor, after all (hey are all "lazy 
bums." feeding off the working class of 
j this country Wrong A small minority of 
the poor are lazy people who would 
rather collect government subsidies 
lhan work, but mnsl aren't.

We'll never know since he was president 
■vrr 50 years ago Things arc different 
today. The United States is a fast-paced 
ever changing nation 

Many people came to the United States 
under the premise of opportunity for all. 
How' can there possibly be opportunity 
for all when we favor social cutbacks? 

Hoover was right, children are our 
most natural resource. We cannot afford 
In let them go to waste We need to 
support children whose parents or

children. If the government doesn't will

Children will be the innovators of 
tomorrow The people who will come up 
with mind-boggling inventions in the

a large number of children go without

that we consider them loo important to 
be ignored 



New buildings

During the fall semester of 1981, IPFW 
gained Iwo beautiful buildings con- 
taining numerous facilities that benefit 
students of higher education. Unfor- 
tunately, these buildings were named 

: the Classroom &amp; Medical and Multi- 
purpose buildings — how dull, boring 

. and unmeaningful

facilities that enable sludents to com- 
plete their first two years of medical 
school in Fori Wayne. 

The Multi-Purpose Building contains
