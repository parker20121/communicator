Mathieu's Resignation; 
Souder In Presidency 



Ainlay Appointed 
Vice-President 



Resignations and appointments 
were the main items of business 
handled by the Student Senate 
at their November 10 meeting. 

Cordd! Mathicu resigned as 
Student Body President. Mark 
Souder assumed the presidency and 
appointed John Ainlay as his vice 
president. The oaths of office 
were administered by Mike Lam- 
borne, acting Chief Justice of 
tbe Supreme Court. 

Mike Lamborne then resigned 
as senator, staling "Since I find 
it impossible according to tbe 
Constitution to serve both in tbe 
Student Court and Student Senate, 
I offer my resignation." 

Souder appointed Lamborne 
the official Chief Justice of the 
Supreme Court. Steve Pettyjohn 



was appointed as an Associate 
Justice to fill a vacancy. 

Don Stuckey was appointed par- 
liamentarian and Betty Tonsing 
was appointed treasurer. 

Four delegates to the Associa- 
tion of Student Governments were 
elected: Mark Souder, John Ain- 
lay, Tom Newman, and Mike 
Lamborne. 

"Our goal," says Souder, "is to 
get good student government. We 
are trying to develop more coor- 
dination between members of the 
government and in what they are 
doing. We are striving to improve 
community relations." 

Says Ainlay, "The primary goal 
of a student government should 
be to increase student participa- 
tion in fundamental decision-mak- 
ing processes, especially those 
most significantly affecting the 
lives of the students. The decision 
to construct Building A (tbe class- 
lab building), for example, was

A concert by the Fifth Di

Student Union Board. 

Jim Leclileitner announced that

ruary 22. A motion made by

PITs "Amelie" 
Opens Nov. 28 

PITs second offering, opening 
November 28 and running Nov- 
ember 29th, 30th, December 5th, 
6th, and 7th, will be Keep An Eye 
On Amelie, a French farce by 
George Feydeau. Written in 1908, 
it concerns Amelie d* Avrancehes, 
(Cynthia Seaman) a French co- 
quette who is living with Etienne, 
(Jim Okleshen) soon to leave for 
training in the Reserves. How- 
ever, Marcel, in order to gain an 
inheritance, complicates the plot 
by telling his godfather he is 
going to marry Amelie. Marcel's 
godfather decides to stay and see 
the ceremony so they plan to 
trick him by having a wedding 
ceremony with a false judge. 
Etienne returns early from the 
service to discover that Amelie 
and Marcel have spent the night 
together and he revises the plan 
to include a real judge. The re- 



sulting chaotic situation creates 
great hilarity. 

Feydeau, whose plots are intri- 
cate and tightly woven, is the 
best writer of French farce since 
Moliere. His characters are con- 
ceived to be laughed at and ridi- 
culed. He shows no compassion in 
his plays and he adds frequent 
touches of the absurd. 

Other members of the cast in- 
clude Mary Mawhorr, Michael 
Ferrigno, Arthur Freidel, David 
Thampson, and Randy Parker. 

Directing the second production 
this semester will be Mr. William 
Turek, a new member to the staff 
this year. Mr- Turek graduate r 
from the University of Nebraska, 
where he directed such plays as 
Pinter's The Lovers and Happy 
Days by Samuel Beckett. His act- 
ing experience includes Three 
Penny Opera and Much Ado A- 
bout Nothing. He has also acted 
in ffughie and An Italian Straw-' 
hat.

Editorial 

So What's 
Fifty Dollars 

by Doug Groves 

What can you do with fifty dollars? Well, you can buy 
a poly-glass tire, a good winter coat, next semester's books 
OR a parking space in the parking lot. A parking place? 

Sure, The same lot in which you park your car with- 
out charge may cost you a cherished fifty dollar bill in the 
near future. But what's fifty dollars? It's .... it's really 
a hell of a lot of money when you start thinking about it not 
to mention spending it. 

Why will you have to pay for facilities which have al- 
ways been free? Simply because this campus is expanding 
and the master plan designates that a new building will 
stand where there are now three hundred parking spaces. 
Of course another parking area will have to be built to 
accommodate the cars and blacktop costs money — a lot of 
money. Guess who's paying for it. 

The purpose of IU-PU is to provide an education at a 
lower cost and easier accessibility than Bloomington or La- 
fayette can offer. IU-PU exists because many students take 
advantage of these factors and attend classes here. Remove 
either or both of these advantages in the form of paid park- 
ing and quite a few students might remove themselves from 
this campus. 

It's like charging a prospective customer fifty cents 
to enter a department store to shop. How many people would 
do business with that store? Not many. 

If we the students all decided to attend another school 
because the advantages that were once offered here no longer 
existed what would happen to IU-PU? It's something for 
the administration to think about. 

But then we'll pay the money won't we, we won't 
raise a big fus3 just because of a mere fifty dollars? Fifty 
dollars isn't really that much. Or is it? 



Student Government 
Comment 



by Mark Souder, Student Body President 

Student Government are not YAF 
ibers. In fact, in my opinion, 
most of the people in Student 
Government are liberals or out- 
id-out leftists. John Ainlay, the 
:w Student Body Vice-President 
vho also serves as President of 
the Student Senate), is hardly a 
•ervative, or a moderate. John 
a key leader of the pro- 
Moratorium faction at our Uni- 
versity. His leftist connections are 
&gt;olid, too solid for a moderate 



Many students, upon hearing 
that I have become Student Body 
President, ate sure to jump to 
one of two conclusions — 1) that 
I sold out my beliefs to become 
President, or 2) that my becoming 
president proves that Student Gov- 
ernment is controlled by conser- 
vatives (i.e. Young Americans for 
Freedom) . Both conclusions are 

First of all, I remain an avowed 
conservative. Barry Goldwalcr is 
my hero, Bill Buckly is my phil- 
osophical leader, and Ronald Rea- 
gan is my choice for the Presi- 
dency in 1972, 1 proudly retain 
my position as College Director 
of Young Americans for Freedom 
In Indiana. I sincerely believe 
YAF is the organization which 
will preserve the system which 
is the greatest to ever appear on 
earth. I like apple pie and am 
proud of our nation's flag. I ho- 
nor and love my parents. I try 
to obey the Ten Ci 



andm 



ind the 



laid 



down by God through .the Bible. 
These beliefs are rooted too deep- 
ly to be renounced or even 

At the same time, not all of Stu- 
dent Government has the same be- 
liefs as I do. Most individuals in 



The Senators Respond 



A few weeks ago a question- 
naire on Student Government was 
passed out to mainly the Student 
Senate members and other im- 
portant officials. Of all these mem- 
bers we received three answers 
which are published below. 
Tom Newman — President Pro- 
tern of the Student Senate, Cam- 
pus Parliament Chairman 

1. What is your general impres- 
sion of student government? 

"My impression of student 
government is that it is a 
group of individuals who put 
in long hours trying to help 
a student body which could 

2. How effective is student gov- 
ernment here at the Regional 

"How effective is student gov- 
ernment relative to what? 
The term government? Not 
at all effective to the idea of 
a University with red 



II the power in the ad- 
d Board of 
Trustees? Fairly effective." 

3. Why are you interested in stu- 
dent government? 

No .nswer (?) 

4. How can Student Government 
be improved here at the Ca.ro- 

"I can't lay down any type 
of improvements because 
when better ideas come along 
they arc acted upon at the 
first opportunity." 

Mike Nusbaumer — Student Sen- 
ator, Constitution Committee 
Chairman 

1. What is your general impres- 
sion of student government? 
"Student Government is on 
the way up. There is at pre- 
sent a "grand coalition" in 
which, for the first time in 
this school's history' people 
have begun to stop the petty 
politics and work for the

good of the student body." 
, How effective is student gov- 
ernment here at the Regional 
Campus? 
"Student Government 
present working on t 
ganization and of the offices, 
so there is not too much go- 
ing on that is visible to the 
student body. 1 think the ef- 
fectiveness of Student Gov- 
ernment can and ivill be mea- 
sured best in the next two or 
three months when the issues 
of paid parking and the stu- 
dent body constitution come 
forth." 
. Why are you interested in stu- 
dent government? 
"I think this campus can 
really go places. I think die 
some 6,000 students at thi 
campus need a definite vote 
in the running of this Univei 
sity which effects their lives 
I think 1 can help, both di 
rectly and indirectly, bring 
this point to the forefront. I 
ant a student and I want a 
responsible voice in the run- 
ning of this university and 
this, in ii iy opinion, should 
be how every concerned stu- 
dent feels." 
. How 

pus? 

"A. Better communications be- 
tween Student Government 
and the student body. 

B. A united front presented 
by the Students' Government. 

C. The giving of meaningfu 
duties and responsibilities t&lt; 
the Student Government. 

D. The need for more peopli 
who are willing to sacrifici 
some time for dicir rights.'

Q. What the heck is ABELARD? 
A. ABELARD is an effort hy the 
students of Indiana-Purdue at Fort 
Wayne to make die general pub- 
lic and all specialized factions of 
the community and the Indiana 
State Legislature aware of the 
over-crowding and unnecessarily 
strained conditions of this cam- 
pus. As you will note from the 
handout circulated in the past, 
the Slate of Indiana provides only 
2.6 percent of the total cost of 
the physical expansion of this 
campus. YOU, through fees, pay 
the rest.

a newspaper we receive no 
in-deptli coverage of news so 
quickly. A newspaper delivers the 
facts in more detail than a tcle- 
n or radio broadcast can, 
i being faster than a lengthy 
ission from a magazine. The 
newspaper gives readers opinions 
heso various events and thus 
helps shape ideas and reactions. 
The campus newspaper can fill 
e function of informing with 
speed and delivering opinions if

he can receive a reaction to

n grow from the events and pro- 
gress into action through compar- 
ison and contrast. 

The goo! of out paper should be 
to foster ideas and serve as a 
media for general communication 
between students. If the scattered 
students here would take advan- 
tage of their paper they would be- 
come a part of the informed cam- 
pus community and also be more 
able to make themselves felt as 
individuals on the many people 
who are otherwise strangers. 

Since the true college experience 
is this meeting and interaction 
between people, we should take ad- 
vantage of the opportunity pre- 
sented by the Communicator to 
extend this experience to an ac- 
tive participation in living. 

(Mrs.) Pamela M. Amhler 
Junior, Purdue 



During a recent and admittedly 
brief survey of the Chicago con- 
spiracy trial 1 discovered it to be 
in my opinion, the greatest mis- 
carriage of the judicial system I 
have ever seen. There have been 
both accusations and positive i- 
dentifications made in this court- 
room which a ten year old child 
could see as being obviously false. 
For example, one of the pigs who 
engaged in what anodier called 
"a police riot", made positive 
identification of Jerry Reuben. He 
saw Reuben only once in pitch 
darkness while Reuben was wear- 
ing a football helmet and full 
beard. 

Furthermore, Bobby Scale, who 
throughout the trial has attempted 
to assert his constitutional right 
to defend himself, has been 
chained and gagged so that he 
may not speak during the pro- 
ceedings. This, seems to be more 
of a throwback to the Spanish In- 
quisition than to American Jus- 
tice. Sealc has called Judge Hoff- 
man "A dirty, low-life living, 
facist dog" and the distinguished 
Judge has apparently set out to 
prove this statement true. 

This entire position can be 
summed up by the statement of 
the President of the Harvard Law 
School who has made a statement 
to the effect that the eight so 
called conspirators came to Chi- 
cago to make a mockery of the 
trial but the judicial system of 
Chicago has prevented this by 
doing it themselves.

Conservative Estimate 

by Don Stuckey 
Question: Why do we trade with 
Communist bloc countries? 
•Answer 1 Oh, but we only trade 
non-strategic goods. 
MY REACTION . . .You're a liar. 
Look at your U.S. Department 
of Commerce export bulletins. 
Such "non-strategic" goods as 
jet, turbo prop, turbo-shaft, and 
gas turbine aircraft engines; 
I.B.M. computers ten years in 
advance of what the Soviets 
have admitted they have devel- 
oped; various military vehicles 
arc being traded to the U.S.S.lt. 
and their salelite countries. 
'Answer 2 Exposure to our pro- 
ducts and ideas will draw the 
Eastern European countries into 

MY REACTION . . . Just look at 
the great progress we have 
made over the past fifteen years. 
In Poland, Yugoslavia, Hun- 
gary, and East Germany shaky 
Communist governments hove 
been able to solidify themselves 
hecause of U.S. economic aid. 
Even if they wanted to come 
our way, do you think the 
strong arm of Soviet tyranny 
would allow it? Czech the 
record. 

•Answer 3 It's good business. 

MY REACTION . . . .Sure the 
Russians are noted for their 
great business practices. In 
1964 the Assembly of Captive 
European nations presented U. 
Thant a claim for over eight 



billion dollars the Sot 



i had 



through overcharging 
for exports and underpricing 
imports. This is how they treat 
their "friends." How will they 
treat us? Also, the Soviets have 
defaulted on most of their 
twenty year and thirty year 
loans issued in the 1920's, 
1930's and IMO's. If you have 
the time, you ought to check 
out Russian debts with the U.N. 
"All answers can be found in 
various issues of the New York 
Times, Vance Hartke's speeches, 
the lecture notes of certain mis- 
guided professors, and other un- 
reliable sources. 



Goals Defined 

by Don Stuckey 

The goals of the Leadership Re- 
treat were 1) to encourage Fresh- 
man who were leaders in high 
school to become leaders at In- 
diana-Purdue; 2) to further de- 
velop the present leaders of the 
campus; and 3) to discuss and 
possibly, solve some of the press- 
ing campus problems. 

Success is the fulfilling of goals. 
Item one, the encouragement of 
Freshman, has paid off well. Most 
of the Freshman who attended the 
Leadership Retreat have become 
active in campus life. I can think 
of very few exceptions. On the 
other hand, I can't think ol any 
Freshman who did not attend the 
Leadership Retreat who is active 
in Student Government. 

Item two was very successful. 
For example, nearly every stu- 
dent leader who attended the Re- 
treat is now active. Many elected 
or appointed leaders who didn't 
go have now resigned. The leaders 
who went all learned much about 
university structure, procedure, 
etc., that they didn't know before. 

Item three, the discussion and

Get The Point? 



En garde! and another fencing 
match otTU-PU Regional Campus 
has begun. Fencing in college? 
Oh yes, a very good part of the 
curriculum that can boast of de- 
veloping your co-ordination as 
well as your mind. 

Fencing instructor at the Re- 
gional Campus is Mr. Henry Wall, 
who holds a degree as a fencing 
master given to him four years 
ago by the International Fencing 
Association in Geneva Switzerland. 
This degree has two requirements 
after it is earned: 1) that the in- 
structor promote fencing where- 
ver he goes, and 2) that the in- 
structor direct fencing matches. 
Mr. Wall, who studied fencing at 
the Fencing Academy in Stuttgart, 
Germany has been teaching fenc- 
ing for forty years. Besides in- 
structing the class at the Reguional 
Campus, he also leaches it at the 
Jefferson Recreational Center, 
South Side YMCA, and Indiana 
Institute of Technology. 

Mr. Wall's idea of fencing is 



highly ir 
l only blar 



self a 

swiftness and mobility and de- 
mands close co-ordination of mind 
and muscles. 

Beginning in December and last- 
ing till April, all colleges and Uni- 
versities will have intercollegiate 
meets. The teams of Fort Wayne 
will be meeting with Toronto TJ-, 
Detroit U., Ohio Stale, Cleveland 
State, and VanderbMt U. A nation- 
al meet will be held following 
all intercollegiate meets to which 
only the highest scoring teams will 
go- 
Presently at IU-PU Regional 
Campus there are nine members 
of the class. Near the end of the 
term a fencing tournament will 
be presented by the class. 

Mr. Wall stated that at the pre- 
sent time "we are trying to get 
fencing in the high schools. Many 
eastern schools already have it, 
but there arc no high schools of- 
fering it as yet here in Fort 
Wayne." 



Rusher's Vietvs 



Students Gone Crazy? 



Mr. William A. Rusher, the pre- 
sent publisher of National Review, 
was a guest speaker here at the 
Campus Tuesday, November 10. 

His talk for the evening was 
centered around the topic "Have 
Students Gone Crazy?" It dealt 
mostly with the activities of the 
new left students. 

He asked the question, "What 
is happening?" and answered it 
by saying, "We cannot blame the 
generation or representatives we're 
dealing with, such as the new 
left, too much. They can't be 
wholly responsible in a sense." 

Rusher also stated that a so- 
ciety exists only when values arc 
present: "We need a general con- 
sensus on certain agreed values, 
rights and wrongs, They need not 
be good things. A society needs 
these agreed values or there's no 
society." 

He believes the Western society 
is derived from a god or a force 
from outside that required us to 
act in certain ways — this being 
the essential cement of the stated 
society. He said, "Values, rights 
and wrongs grounded in some 
sanctions are believable to most 



people and \ 


ithout that there is 


no society." 




He again 


asked a question, 


"How weak a 


e we?" He feels our 



id but our 
sanctions are lost. There are no 
longer ten commandments, but 
rather eight or nine good sug- 
gestions or ideas. 

Rusher again brought up the 
new liberal generation. He said 
there is a need for a workable plan 
for this group. He feels, "Com- 
munism in its own crude way 
will work." He also stated that 
"Last summer much was against 
us. There was a collapse of society 
•or was it a collapse? The U.S. 
put two men on the moon. This 
was done while yippics tried to 
defend themselves on the con- 
spiracy trial-others were more in- 
terested in foreign countries-other 
interesting stuff happened in the 
U.S. Of all these, what would we 
state as the most significant e- 
venl? Who has the future in his 
hands— Mark Rudd or Neil Arm- 
Mr. Rusher concluded his talk 
by stating, "People that have no 
program cannot tighten the Am- 



Volunteer Tutor 
Program Begun 



A program of volunteer student 
tutoring was established 1 a ! 
month here in Fort Wayne by 
small group of Vista Volunteers 
headed by Barry Balonck. The 
tutors are voluntary college 
dents who help children between 
the third and sixth grades, 
children and their parents ca 
to the center at 2120 John Street 
for help. At times, Mr. Balonek 
gets lists from the schools in tl 
area of those children ivho are 
need of academic help. He thi 
calls the parents and explains tl 
program to the, the decision 
participate in this program is i _ 
to them. So far, the response has 
been 100% effective. 

Barry Balonek, the head and 
originator of this program, 
I960 graduate of Colgate anc 
been a Vista volunteer for 
months. This is his initial attempt 
in setting up this type of a 
gram. He is experimenting with 
this program is this area to prove 
the feasibility of tutoring the 
ner-city youth with college age 
students. It is hoped that one 
colleges will eventually offci 
ner-city problems as a college level 
course. 

The Volunteer Tutor Prog? 
has been greatly successful 
UCLA for the past five years; 
it has become well-established of 
New York and Connecticut. The 
Vista workers have found that 
whenever these programs had 
established for several years, they 
became ingrown in the commun 
ity, with the result of very )ittl&gt; 
supervision required after thi 
first few meetings between thi 
tutor and the child. 



erican society. They can bring it 
down or force radical alterations 
but could ony force in patterns of 
a Tightest authoritarianism!" 
A question and answer period 
:d the talk, in which state- 



&gt; he 



lade i 



"People do not matter as much 
they think they do." He stated 
political belief which reads: Seek 
ye first the political kingdom 
all will come to you. 

In other questions asking for 
solutions or a "workable pro- 
gram," Mr. Rusher either had nc 
solutions or just vague ideas 
When asked how to conquer po&gt; 
verly, he had a two point program 
which stated: 

1) We should label out a 
cified amount of money 
such as the guaranteed 



ial i 



c level 



The question was asked if he 
was Hanoi or Moscow, how would 
ho get peace? He answered, "The 
communists should lake over all 
until 'peace' would be restored." 

Another question, "What extent 
arc Communist heading student 
movement of destroying society?" 
was answered, "Communists have 
fancy phrases and call it a break 
up of 'American Capitalists So- 
ciety.' But the Communists want 
order and they also have a dif- 
ferent set of objectives." 



Essentially, the tutor and the 
child meet for 1 hour, 1 day a 
week. During this lime, the tutor 
helps the child with his home- 
work, other academic problems, 
and new material which he does 
not understand. Gradually, as a 
friendship develops, a greater un- 
derstanding results between them. 
Not only can the college student 
help the child academically, but 
he can become a "big brother" 
image to the child. The tutor is 
encouraged to meet more often 
with the child as they become bet- 
ter acquainted. This type of teach- 
ing process can result in a new 
world for the child— one of new 
places he may never have been 
in, e.g., museums, libraries, zoos, 
and other forms of a more cultur- 
ally stimulating environment. 

A strong rapport between the 
tutor and the parents of the child 
he is tutoring is also stressed. 
Since no strict progress reports 
are required, the tutor will feel 
free to inform the parents of the 
progress of their child, and to ad- 
vise them on disciplinary needs or 
other types of parental supervbion 
that the child needs. 

The Vista Volunteers set up thi 
initial meeting between thi 
lege student and the child. Hope&lt; 
fully, the relationship will flower 
from then on. 

This program was first an- 
nounced by Mr. DeFronzo in sev- 
eral of the sociology classes here 
at the Regional Campus. One out 
of five students spoken to vol- 
unteered. He expressed his sur- 
prise at the large reply of this 
college, because in the East, re- 
cruiting is much belter in the 
private colleges than in the com- 
munity colleges. St. Francis Col- 
lege was the first institute of 
higher education which estab- 
lished this program in this area. 
There are approximately 30 St. 
icis students plus 80 I.U.- 
lue students involved. 
you are interested in tutor- 
an inner-city youngsters, call 
omc in and talk to Mr. De- 
Fronzo or Mr. Horowitz. If you 
prefer, call the John Street Center 
(near the Greenfield Square hous- 
ing project) at 456-9513. 

Can you afford to spend 1 hour, 

day a week helping someone 
help himself?

Pamela Tealtan ■ Carol Sowle 
In the post ten years, new 
developments in camera design 
have come ihick and fast. The 
trend has been toward the small 
camera. The Polaroid Land Cam- 
era has made possible "pictures 
in a minute" — actually in ten se- 
sonds — and "instant color" is now 
a reality. The zoom lens, first de- 
veloped for movie cameras, is 
finding its place on still cameras. 
Automatic cameras which adjust 
their lens according to the strength 
of the light are now common. 
The demands for knowledgeable 
photographers to handle these 
cameras has increased competition 
among camera manufacturers in 
Europe, Japan, and the United 
States. 

The main problem for the be- 
ginning, or even the professional 
protographer, is which camera to 
buy. The first thing to think about 
is the type of photography you 
want to do. This is important 
when thinking about camera pos- 
sibilities. While there arc cameras 
for all purposes, there is no one 
all-purpose camera. That's why it 
is so important to be very clear 
about the type of pictures you 

There are mainly eleven types 
of cameras, but for the sake of 

space, we irill only cover the most 
important of them. 

The 3 'ihiNi range- find &lt;

with the Leica and Contax being 
two pioneer cameras of this type. 
The coupled rangefinder 3f 
cameras include a wide variety 
of modles from the simplest 
priced units using f/2.8 lenses, to 
others with built-in exposure 
ters. Many accessories are 
vided for this type of cart 
making it one of the most 
satile instruments available. There 
are copying and close-up attach- 
ments, and a wide variety of 
lenses ranging from the extreme 
wide angle 21mm to the 135mm 
telephoto. 

Another type of 35mm cai 
in the rangefinder category is the 
helf- frames. These compact 
dies produce a frame size 
suring 24 by 18 mm instead of 
the usual full-sized 24 by 36 mm. 
Most half-frame models are used 
for casual snap shooting, and 
therefore use zone- focusing in- 
stead of a coupled rangefinder. 
An example of the 35 mm range- 
finder is the Fujico Auto-M. It 
has all the features of the range- 
finder plus exposure prevention 
when light is too low for ex- 
posure control. 

For a number of years there 
has been an observable trend away 
from the 35 mm rangefinder and 
toward the 35 mm single-lens Te- 
flex, or SLR, the photographer 



actually sees through the picture- 
taking lens itself, viewing the sub- 
ject exactly as the lens sees it. 
This through-lhe-Icns viewing eli- 
des the problem of parallax 
■ and permits precise com- 
position on the ground glass. 

Most of today's SLR's feature 
automatic lens diaphragms which 
permit viewing and focusing with 
"ie lens wide open. Another de- 
ilopment of SLR's is the behind- 
ihe-lens meter. The meter is placed 
in the path of the image from 
lead the light that will 
hit the film at film plane. This 
makes it unnecessary to compute 
filter factors when using tubes or 
lellows. 

The twin-lens reflexe has two 
separate lenses — one for focusing 
and framing, the other for taking 
the picture. Some professional 
portrait photographers who like 
n-lens reflex system, but 
ih to use a larger negat: 
ave had special 
built for tJieir own personal use 
One of these is called "Gowand 
flex." It comes in two models, fo 
4 by 5 and 5 by 7 sheet film. Thi 
Rolliflex was the pioneer of thi 
twin-lens rclflex type of camera 
The latest Rolliflex models havi 
built-in exposure meters and auto 
matic exposure. The Mamiyaflc: 
is also a twin-lens reflex model, 
itli removable lens boards. The 
amiyaflcx has separate inter- 
changeable lens systems for wide- 
angle, normal, and telephoto lenses. 
Polaroid Land cameras form s 
class all by themselves. Their uni- 
que feature is the built-in develop 
ing equipment which makes il 
possible to view a finished prinl 
just ten seconds after the shutter 
is snapped. 

The earliest of the Polaroid cam 
eras bad a very simple lens am 
shutter, having none of the usua 
settings. Instead, turning a singli 
wheel gave a scries of numbered 
settings; and the user soon learned 
which number gave the best ex- 
posure. 

In keeping with trend to auto- 
mation, some Polaroid Cameras 
feature a electronic shutter and 
simplified filmpack loading. 

The electronic shutter reads the 
light and automatically regulates 
exposure time for both daylight 
flash pictures. All models are 
basically the same except that the 
higher priced ones have true 
rangefinder focusing, belter optics 
and more features. 

The fifth and last of the group 
is the Quick Loading cameras. To 
meet growing demand for operat- 
ing ease, two new types of cam- 
eras are now being marketed — 
the Kodak Instamalic and the 
Agfa Rapid type. The Instamalic 
system has proven so successful 
that other manufacturers have in-

Russian Roulette With Three 



Bullets Instead Of One 
Early In Basketball Season 



by Darrell Parnin 

Indiana ■ Purdue's basketball 
squad b playing Russian roulct 
with three bullets instead of one 
early this season. The reason be- 
ing they cannot scout the first 
four teams ihey come against. 

Imagine going to an afternoon 
concert in the student lounge ex- 
pecting the Few die Lords and 
finding Diana Ross and the Su- 
premes. Imagine traveling to an 
away game only to find you're 
playing a pack of 250 pound full 
backs or a guard as talented as 
Purdue's Rick Mount. It's like 
being a high diver and having a 
coin flip determine whether the 
tank is filled with water or empty. 

This was the situation faced at 
Spring Arbor November 18 and 
the one to be confronted at Mac- 
ion tomorrow night and at South- 
western Michigan November 25. 

The task facing Coach Altman 
is to prepare for anything. As 
Assistant Coach Skelton explained, 
"play will largely determine what 
we do. If they have a good out- 
side shooter who hits, then we'll 
go man to man on defense to 
stop him. If the ball is worked to 
the inside, then we'll zone and 
try to clog it up." 



And so a season producing 
dreams and pro bio

Altman Gets Head Basketball 
Post; Skelton Assists 



by Darrell Parnin 

Maistro, a drum roll plea 
itroducing head basketball coach, 
Bill Altman. In his initial se, 
at the helm, he is charged with 
producing winning seasons and 
building sport interest in the stu- 
dents. A task likened to scoring 
against Ohio State, beating the 
New York Knicks, or blocking a 
field goal attempt by Lew Al- 
cinder. 

Playing high school basketball 
in Moorcsville, Indiana, he 
scorched the nets at a twenty-five 
point average per game. His abil- 
ity to score was matched early by 
his ability to be a gentleman as 
he received the Midstate Confer- 
ence Sportsmanship Award. 

After finishing 5th in his class, 
he attended Indiana University at 
Lafayette as a business major. In 
the hard wood seasons 1959-61, 
he played varsity basketball there. 
His play, though, in three years 
never got beyond the second 
siring level. During his sophomore 
year he connected for seventeen 
points in thirteen games. Things 
got worse before better as he 
found out his junior year scoring 
only four points in nine games. 
Disheartened he could have quit; 
however, he didn't. He came back 
his senior year adding depth to 
the I.U. bench. While gathering 
forty - five points in fourteen 



games, he popped the nets hit- 
ting forty- eight per cent from 
the field. 

His scoring ability was neither 
outstanding, nor worth discussing 
at dinner. But one thing was, his 
love of the game and his know- 
legde of it. Pop Warner, Knute 
Rockne, and Woody Hayes could- 
n't in their best days run the 100 
yard dash under 30 seconds, on 
a slow stop watch. Johnny Wood- 
en could never jump high enough 
to touch the basketball nets. And 
yet these coaches were never 
losers, but the great stand-outs 
in college football and basketball. 
They were great because they in- 
spired greatness, coaching their 
teams to repeated National cham- 
pionships. These are men who 
loved the game and had a know- 
ledge of it. They share this trait 



with Bill Altman. But do they 
share that ability to inspire play- 
ers? Only time and history will 
tell. 

Assisting the head coach is Mr. 
Richard Skcllon. For six years he 
coached high school basketball in 
the state of Colorado, a state 
where referees continually stop 
games to clear the floor of snakes 
and scorpions. A state where 
dust storms postpone games. 

From 1965 until 1968 he assis- 
ted in building the original sports 
program here at Indiana-Purdue. 
This season, he and Coach Alt- 
man established the beginning of 
varsity competition. A season 
when each field goal, each per- 
sonal foul is a new record in an 
empty book. 

And that's the way it is, this 
sports week in 1969.

Kidneys." His address will include 
a discussion of problems asso- 
ciated with materials used for 
the fabrication of artificial hearts 
and kidneys and how such mater- 
ials must be compatible with the 
blood. He will also discuss a very 
promising approach to the devel- 
opment of blood compatible ma- 
terials which includes the attach- 
ment of an anticoagulant to pro-

A Funny Thing Happened 
On The Way To The Archives 



Bloom ington, Ind. — William 
Clements' job is good for a lot 
of laughs, but underneath the 
laughter - is the ugly side of hu- 
man nature. ~ 

The Indiana University grad&gt; 
ualo student is archivist at the 
University's Folklore Department. 
Included in tlie archives ore sev- 
eral filing cabinets filled with 
jokes, parodies, limericks, and 
other samples of folk humor. 

Ethnic jokes ranging from mild- 
ly insulting to vicious portrayal 
of alleged racial characteristics 
are among the 50 or more classi- 
fications of jokes in the files. 

There are jokes about Negroes, 
told by white informants, and 
there arc jokes about Negroes, 
told by Negroes, in which the 
white person comes off second 
Best. Jews tell jokes about Arabs; 
Arabs tell jokes about Jews. A 
joke told about Jews by a native 
of Irati is also told by a Malaysian 
about the Chinese. 

So-called "dumb Polack" jokes 
have their ethnic variations a- 
round the world. Cements points 
out. The point of the joke is 
that one ethnic group, or, in some 
cases a regional group within a 
racial group, is very stupid. 

As an example, one folklore in- 
formant tells of such jokes told 
by Arabs in Iran, about non- 
Semitic Kurds of the North. The 
informant points out that the 
Arabs claim the Kirds are stu- 
pid because they do not know how 
to write in Arabic. Normally such 
jokes are told by Arabs to other 
Arabs, the informant says. 

The ability to laugh at one's 
self is illustrated in some of the 
jokes which are told by ethnic 
groups about themselves. In gen- 
eral, however, the tone of the 



jokes and the ethnic background 
of the informants indicate that 
the appeal of the ethnic joke rests 
on giving one ethnic group a 
feeling of superiority over another. 

Another classification which il- 
lustrates a perverse and distorted 
view of human events is the sick 
joke. The appeal of such jokes de- 
pends on a shocking and unex- 
pected comment on human tra- 
gedy. 

There arc scaltalogical jokes in 
the file which have no humor and 
have appeal based on human func- 
tions or organs. Such subjects 
are normally taboo in polite con- 
versation, and this gives them 
their limited appeal, Clements 

By far the largest classification 
in the folklore humor file is jokes 
relating to sex. A card file nearly 
four inches thick contains synop- 
ses of sex jokes. Here again, Cle- 
ments explains, the appeal is 
based largely on the fact that this 
is a subject not openly discussed 
in intimate detail by most persons. 

Although the archives contain 
a variety of folklore, samples of 
folk humor are most often col- 
lected by students in their intro- 
ductory folklore courses. The col- 
lections go back 30 years, and 
jokes about political or entertain- 
ment personalities are found up- 
dated with a contemporary figure 
as the butt of the joke. Clements 
believes that most of the current 
jokes can be traced back to earlier 

Here arc some samples, which 
range from kindergarten humor 
to ancient limericks: 

"What do you call a cross be- 
tween a centipede and a parrot? 
Answer: A walkie-talkie." 

"What did the 500-pound mouse 



right." 



ailable 



say when he went into the alley? 
Here, kitty, kitty." 

"Little Audrey saw her little 
brother fall down the stairs and 
she laughed and laughed because 
she knew her brother had on his 
new fall suit." 
"A young theologian named 

Fiddle 
Refused to accept his degree. 
Said he, 'it's enough to be Fiddle, 
Without being Fiddle, D.D.' " 

Graffiti, a kind of communica- 
tion, sometimes humorous, which 
dates back to ancient Rome, is 
included in the humor selections. 
Here are some sampes in the 
folklore collection: 

"Chicken Little wa 
{The sky is falling.) 

"Did Dracula die i: 

Sign in a men's ro 
this wall will be a 
paperback." 

The frustrations of would-be 
literary geniuses is found in a 
collection of autograph book jot- 
tings. These inane writings were 
once popular among pre-Ieen and 
early teen-agers. Here are a few: 

"When you see a skunk run 
up a tree, then pull its tail and 
think of me." 

"When you get married and 
have some twins, don't come to 
me for safety pins." 

"Roses are red, violets are blue. 
You have a shape of a B-52." 

What is the god of collecting 
folk humor? Does it really have- 
a place in [he pursuit of know- 
ledge? Clements answers: 

"Folklore is a part of man's 
total culture. For this reason alone 
it should be studied. Like his lit- 
erature, his music, and his art, 
man's folklore reveals some psy- 
chological or sociological truths 
about him."

Response To 
Dell Ford 

As reported in the journal-Ga- 
ette of November 12, the manager 
f the bureau of the Christian 
Science Monitor was present on 
campus on November 11, 
sponsored by the Convocations 
Committee. Miss Ford's criticisms 
Attendance at this event was 
disgracefully small (thirty -six 
warm bodies). Also, the lounge 
had the appearance of a pigpen. 
The reader should be concerned 
with the image of our campus as 
reflected in the opinion of the 
city. "Who should be blamed? The 
Convocations Committee for in- 
sufficient publicity? The custodial 
staff for not having the facilities 
clean.? (Have you ever been in 
the cafeteria at 7 AM? A dump 
from the day before. Moldy green 
coffee, spilled ashtrays, etc.) 
Blame whoever you will. This 
campus must be able to present 
the semblance of an academic 
community to the public. Dell 
Ford is justified in criticising the 
situation.

and resume to the Publishing Edi- 
tor via the office of Student Ser- 
vices in Km. 103. Deadline for

Dr. Becker To 
Attend Conference 

Dr. Benjamin Becker of the 
Purdue University Fort Wayne 
Campus faculty will go to Ox- 
ford, Ohio, Friday and Saturday 
to discuss "Actinomycetes Against 
Leprosy" before members of the 
Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan 
branches of the American Society 
for Microbiology. The two -day 
event is being sponsored by Miami 
University, the host school. 

Forseveral years, Dr. Becker has 
performed research in the area of 
experimental vaccines which may 
be protective against the leprosy 
bacteria in man. There are known 
to be as many as 20 million lepers 
in the world and, as yet, no pro- 
tective vaccine has been discov- 
cred. It is his hope to discover 
several vaccines which can be 
tested against blood serum ob- 
tained from human lepers. 

The conference will attract its 
audience not only from the uni- 
versities in this Tri-State area but 
also from various medical labor- 
atories and pharmaceutical com- 

Dr. Becker received his bach- 
elor's degree in chemistry at 
Rutgers University and both his 
master's and Ph.D. degrees in 
microbiology were conferred at 
the Institute of Microbiology at 
Rutgers. 

Prior to coming to Purdue, 
Prof. Becker was associated with 
Hamilton College, Clinton, N.Y., 
He has been the recipient of U.S. 
Public Health Service grants and 
grants conferred by the Zibikoff 
Fund for Medical Research. 

He is a member of the Ameri- 
can Society for Microbiology, 
Sigma Xi, American Chemical 
Society, Phi Lambda Upsilon and 
the American Institute of Biolo- 
gical Sciences.

those ."concerning paid parking

students. Paid parking has a 
tremendous effect on the students. 
Paid parking may cost as much 
as $60 per year, yet the students

"I see the university today as 
being more and more composed 
of scholars — administration and 
staff. In some cases this is un- 
fortunate. It should be remem- 
bered that the primary role of 
the administration in the univer- 
sity community is to facilitate 
communications between faculty 
and students. The less prominent 
they are, the less noticeable their 
function, the better. 

"The main problem of student 
government is to restructure itself 
in this period of transition from 
a small campus to a larger one. 
1 hope to be able to do my part 
to fill this position adequately."
