Congress debates budget: Can financial aid survive 



cuis? 



By Mellvsa Young-FlnrM 
News Edilor 

As Congtcss moves closer to balancing 
the buJgci, siudcnls may soon be scram- 
bling 10 scrape up llic dollars to altend 
college. Both ihc Mouse and Senalc have 
approved their individual budget amend- 
ments and now awail the conference com- 
miltcc's version. 

"There are ceriain people in Congress 
who feel in order lo balance die budget. 
dicy need to cut Tinancial aid," said Bob 
Zcllcrs, director of financial aid. 

Zcllcrs said, however, the House and 
Senate amendments are very different in 
terms of cuts to financial aid, and students 
and parents can only wail and see which 
version the conference committee selects. 

Tellers reports students will probably 
not see a major difrcrencc in Hnancial aid 
in the 1995-06 school year, bul said the 
major shock will probably surface during 
the 1996-97 school year, 

According to Zellers, subsidies on 
Stafford Loans have been seen as a target 
of easy savings, but said some studies 



suggest that Student Direct landing could 
offer the comparable savings. 

ZelleR said aldiough subsides may be 
cul, die loans will still be made available 
to students. However, the federal govem- 
menl will not pay the interest over the 
duration of the borrower's schooling. 

As a result, studcnLs would eidicr have 
to pay die interest while attending college 
or tack the interest accumulated during 
that time to the final bill. This, depending 
on the final decision of Congress, could 
increase the amount students owed by 25 
to 50 percent, according to Zcllers. 

Student Direct Lending is a federal 
program which allows students to borrow 
money for higher education directly from 
the federal govemmcnl, rather than pri- 
vate lenders. 

According to a United StaiCN 
Department of liducaiion press reletisc. 
Direct Lending saves the taxpayers 
money. 

"Direct Lending is easier and faster." 
said U.S. Secretary of Education Richard 
W. Riley, "it offers a riuige of repayment 



plans, ii makes education more atlordable 
and gives young people wider career 
options that allow them to serve their 
communities and their country. And it 
saves the taxpayers a considerable amount 
of money as well." 

The program, however is listed as one 
of the proposed reductions in the amend- 
ments. According to a press release from 
the White House, efforts arc being made 
lo cap the program at 40 percent participa- 
tion. 

Although IPFW does not participate in 
the program. Purdue University, die man- 
aging body of IPFW, formed a Direct 
Lending Task Force to evaluate the pro- 
gram for the West Lafayette campus. 

According to Joyce Hall, director of 
liiiancial aid lor Purdue Uiuversiiy anii 
chairperson of the Direct Lending Task 
force, the task force reviewed the pro- 
gram and felt it was neither feasible at diis 
lime nor proved to be a top priority lor the 
university. 

Hall said the West Lafayette campus is 
currently focusing on a student data base. 



early award letters, and itie filing of 
admissions electronically. 

"Our priority is to implement die stu- 
dent data base," Hall said. "It certainly 
doesn't mean wc won't keep watching 
Direct Lending." 

Zcllcrs said he does not foresee Direct 
Lending as an option for IPFW students 
in the near future, but like Hall will keep 
an eye on the program. 

Even if financial aid dollars are not 
significantly cut during die balancing of 
the budget, Zcllers said additional money 
will not be made available to sludcnus. 

"We know then; will not be any addi- 
tional funding," 2^1lers said, "Assuming 
that Pell Grants continue at the maximum 
level, there will not be an increase and 
wiihiiul ;iny [idUiluiniil dollars inihiiion 
will erode die value," 

Zcllers said despiie whatever route 
Congress takes, students will end up pick- 
ing up more of the tinanclal burden. 

"Bottom line Its going to cost siu- 
deiiLs more money lo «ei dieir education." 
said Zellers.

One on one with Wartell: a close look at the chancellor 



Michael WartcU could be anyone. 
Nothing clues the casual observer in to his 
position as chancellor of IPFW. except 
maybe die television set and private secrc- 
Lirial suite. 

He talks, acts and seems like your typi- 
cal father with two kids, a bouse and a job. 
When he talks about his family and his past 
he IS just anodier (adier. but when he starts 
talking about the university, its strengths 
and weaknesses and its future, it is easy to 
understand how he got to where he is 
today. 

He successfully avoids sensitive issues 
like expansion while plugging different 
university programs and promoting the uni- 
versity. 

This is not a bad thing. As the head of 
this institution he is supposed to show its 
best face to die press. That is not his only 
duty as chancellor He is also responsible 
for making sure diings run smoothly. 

Wartell said, "I look at my job as being 
responsible for bringing together every- 
thing that is necessary to help tbe university 
keep going and growing." 

Waned said he also spends a lot of time 
in meetmgs. Many people might think that 
would be iKiring. but Wanelt says it is not. 

"They are mostly very interesting. 



MosQy people are trying to be creative lo 

get their jobs done. Some days ii isn't so 
hoi. some days it is wonderful, A lot of jobs 
are like dial. All in all it is a great job You 
get to see the results ol what you do." 

One recent result Wartell got to see was 
the approval of die Science Building by the 
legislature. 

■'I don't think there was a whole lot 
more csciiemeni dian when the legislature 
passed our Science Building. We worked 
very hardtoget Uiai." 

Wartell. a native of New Mexico, has 
lived in Denver, Virginia. California and 
now in the Midwest. Although he and his 
wife like to travel, it is his job that has 
caused them to move so many times He 
has worked as a chemistry professor and as 
the dean of science at several different 
insuiutions. 

Although his academic work makes up 
most of his career, he also worked for 
Sandia National Labs in Albuquerque. New 
Mexico. 

Wartell said he really enjoyed the time 
he spent at Sandia, hut was happy to get 
back into academics. 

Wartell came to IPFW in the fall of 
1993 and was appointed chancellor in 
1994. 

He said he tvants to change IPFW's rep- 
utation . "It's called bypass U and a com- 
munity college, but that is not what it is." 



He said he doesn't think IPFW is appre- 
ciated. "IP[-"\V ha.\ a vibrant firsl-raie ma-, 
ter's program," Wareill said. 

IPFW is also on lt^ 
way 10 becoming the 
institute of choice in 
northeast Indiana, thai i.s 
if Waned has his way. 

Both Vice Chancellor 
of Financial Affairs Wall 
Branson and Wartell are 
working toward that 
goal. 

Branson said, "We 
really want die campus to 
be a place where people 
will diink of IPFW first, 
before they think of any- 
thing else, and say 'yes. I 
want to go there.' ' 

Eventually tliis would 
mean dorms, probably 
behind Canterbury 
Green. 

This, however, is still 
a long ways off. "It 
depends on a lot of 
things coming together. 
Those things include stu- 
dents* needs and Ihc 
financial situation." 
Waned said. 

In addition 



to Wanell's plans for IPFW as die "univer- 
sity of choice" he has three main goals: 
- l-nhance die (|ualiiy of education 



• InCTcasc access to IPFW 

- Integrate IPI-W mm tlie ifunrnuni 

- See Wartell page 5

ful back ground vocals provided by 
Joanne Caiherall and Susan Ann 
Sullcy. It is hannomes tike these that 

easily the album's best song. 

But the second is not bad cither. 
"These Are The Days" is an invigo- 
rating and danceablc song that sways 
from their usual guy-sings-thc-verse- 
and-the-ladics-sing-the-chorus for- 
mat. It's here thai you may get the 
sense that someone has put the D-52's 
and the Pel Shop Qoys into the same 

But the fun slops tlicrc. "Words" 
may have just of been titled "Worst" 
because it certainly Is. Someone must 
have told Philip Oakey lo try to sing 
this one Broadway style. If only he 
had the voice for it. Qui it's not 
entirely Oakcy's voice at fault. The 
song lyrics are simply weak ("Words 



Words -:iinK hack 10 haunt you"l. 

■House l-ull Of Nothing" saysju.^i 
thai, nothing. This song was meant to 
he J song about obsessively missing a 
former lover. But instead it has lumed 
inio a whiny plea for the days of old 
[ hear this song and 1 am happy thai 
the girl got away safely. [ don't think 
that was the meaning that was intend- 
ed. 

"Octopus" does try to make a 
comeback with the instrumental 
"John Clcese; Is He Funny?," a 
punchy dance number ihat would 
have been ruined by lyrics, and 
"Cruel Young Lover," a song that 
almost everyone can relate to. 

The real problem with this album 
is that it was done entirely wlih com- 
puters. Even Ihc Pet Shop Boys and 
Erasure, both of whom use machines 
heavily in their music, add soirte real 
musical instruments from time to 
time. The songs on "Octopus" seem 
to be invented, rather than created. 
Maybe the band should call them- 
selves the Computer League. 

This album scores a 4 out of a pos- 
sible 10.

Well, my friends. I am son 
of back. But have no fear, this 
is just a little movie review. 
Maybe next week I will tackle 
world peace or something of 
imponance; maybe not. 

Instead of discussing the 
possible mLsthal of the 'Trial of 
the Century.' I will review Mel 
Gibson's latest flick. 
Bravchean." 

Wow! Yes, wow Ls the first 
thing I must say about this three 
hour movie with the sexy hunk 
we have all grown to love over 
the years. Not only did Gibson 
star in this great true siory of 
Scotsman William Wallace, he 
also directed the Tdm. 

To get Oown to the basics, 
the length of the film was not 
very good for my arse, as the 
Scots would say. But aside 
from that, Ihc story was liuly 
interesting. 

Along about the late 13ih 
century a young Scottish rebel 
rimed William Wallace led a 
revolt against the English who 
reigned over Scotland at the 
me. According lo history. 



Real McCoy 



Piiul Tuppcr 
Features Editor 

Wlien Ihc album "Anoilicr Night" 
was released, I was just sick of Ihe 
single "Another Night." But 1 was 
curious anil bought il iinyway. To be 
honest, I was pleasantly suprised. 
What we have here is a fun, dance- 
able' album Ihat asks only to be 
enjoyed lightly. 

Tliut's not to say that disc is fault- 
less, llie first fault is the weak lyrics. 
Have you listened to the words (0 the 
title track? It'*.Dot-c»aciry.y.;ais 
poetry .sciJo a dar)ec.bcai_».-&gt;.&gt;^ 

The second fault i.-i the talents of 
the Real McCoy band members. Olaf 
Jcglilza's rapping is muddled and 
unclear, while Palsy Petersen and 
Vanessa Mason do nol have great 
vocal ranges themselves. 



But they arc not really claiming 10 
be Whitney Houston or Snoop Doggy 
Dogg so it docs not mailer This disc 
is entertaining, showing more variety 
than Ace of Base did on their debui. 
"The Sign." 

The most pulsating number is 
"Run Away." This song can get even 
the reddest of rednecks on Ihc dance 
floor. Even though the song was 
played to death, no one can deny that 
"Another Night" is a clubber's dream 
song. 

- ."-T l ill- th i s- w ould 'Sc. a.bo tins album 
if-every songwas-a-snpcrfasi club 
hit. Knowing this, the band widely 
added pop cuts like "Come And Gel 
Your Love" and "Ooh Boy." And if 
you look closely, you may find a bal- 
lad reminiscent of the Pet Shop Boys' 
"West End Girls" in "Sleeping With 



An Angel." 

If you can'l dance enough, there's 
"Operator," a song best suited for a 
roller derby, and "Love &amp; Devotion." 

We could pick this album with a 
fine tooth comb and find many more 
mistakes, but why bother? This debut 
effort by Real McCoy is a fun party 
disc Ihat should be enjoyed by anyone 
looking to escape songs with heavy 
meaning and depressing lyrics. For 
achieving this, I rale this album a 7 
oulofapos.'iibte 10

Wallace was the lir&gt;t popul;ir 
her\i of Scotland 

The movie iucif follows the 
story of Wallace's fight fort.; 
freedom. His passion and his;' 
dedication are well-portrayed 
by Gibson. It is important to 
remember thai this movie is 
VIOLENT, and do 1 mean vio- 
lent. I do not think I have ever 
seen so much blood in my life. 
but hey. it's Mel Gibson, need I 
say moK'lTl 

I personally hated content of 
this movie, but liked Ihe ending 
of this epic siory of freedom. 
After many years of Fighting for 
what he believed in most, 
Wallace was caught by the 
English and tortured. All he h:id 
to say was "mercy" and he 
would have been allowed to 
live. Whether he said "mercy" 
or not you will have to llnd out 
for yourself. 

So go ahead and check out 
this flick; you won't be sorry.

• A pmonal inl«rv)«w by 
Paul Tupper, Fealures Fditnr 

Elaine Lindcr is everyone's 
friend. If she were a sori drink, she 
would be a mixiurc of tropical Tniii 
Kcx)l-Aid and sclizcr water. If she 
were a fattening food, she would be 
carnival cotlon candy. You gel the 
idea. She has no enemies and can 
he loiolly misted. You may remem- 
ber Ihai she was president of the 
siudcni aclivilics txiard up uniil she 
graduated in May. Dui she will not 
leave. Her love for this campus is 
so great ihal she is a temporary 
employee in the exact office that 
she used lo work in. I sat down with 
her for an impromptu giggle session 
and this interview is the result. 



P.T,: JusI explain lo our readers 
exactly what you do now. 
IZ.L.: I am a temporary in the office 
of Student Activities until the end 
of June. Pan of what 1 do is fill in 
for the director of student activities. 
I am helping organia; the organiza- Fort Wayne, 
lional fair for SOAR. I am also fill- 
ing in for the secretary while she 
away for two weeks on vacation. 



P.T.: What are you going 

here? 

E.L.: Right now 1 am looking for a 

job. What I'd like to do is plan 

activities and fund-raisers for a 

large social service organization in

E.L.: If I don't find a job that I am 
looking for right a way, dien 1 can 
always go back to retail, while I 
keep searching. 




Pdolo tiy Sara Valeniln*. Pnolo EdJlof 

With Elaine Under, the 
fun never stops. 



P.T.: Whul degree did you graduate 

ivilli? 

l'!.L.: I graduated in May wiih a 

degree in psycliolngy. 



P.T.: Which is what you did here as 

student activities president. It 

sounds like you would certainly be 

qualified. 

E.L: I'm probably going to end up 

in fasi food ot retail. 



P.T.: Do you think your time at 
IPFW has prepared you for what 
lies ahead? 

E.L.: Sure. I love IPFW. I don't 
want to leave. I think I've benefited 
from, number one. my education, 
and number two. my extracurricular 
experience. I've been involved with 
the student activities board and stu- 
dent government, and other campus 
organizations like the university 
singers. I have been an orientation 
assistant loo. I feel like I have got- 
ten to know many of Che students 
and die administration. This is like 
my second home. 

P.T.: Why is there a lack of partici- 
pation regarding student organiza- 
tions? 

E.L.: I think that one reason is that 
students here have other priorities. 
They have jobs and families, and 
their time is limited. Bui I also 
think il Is harder for students to get 
involved because this is not a resi- 
dciiiial cainpus. so ii is harder lo gel 
lo know other people and the orga- 
. Students really have to 



lake the initiative 

P.T.; What advice have \vu given to 
vounuccessar. Enn Fndh'' 
E.L.: Her first job was setting up 
the "Forresl Gump" showing, and I 
told her to not to take things person- 
ally, especially when things don't 
work out the way she plans. And of 
course. I told her to have fun. 

P.T.; / have known you since high 
school and you have always been 
this energetic go-getter. 
E.L.: I have had a good life. 1 have 
a family that loves me and supports 
me. so no matter how bad things get 
at word or at school, I can always 
go home to my famdy. I think that 
makes a big difference. 

P.T.: When your life is in order and 
you have the bouse and the husband 
and the children and the career, 
what will you remember from 
IPFW? 

E.L.: Well, I will never forget walk- 
ing around dressed in a panda bear 
suit! 1 was handing out flyers for 
the toy drive to benefit the child 
care center. I was afraid that people 
would come and pounce me. Dui it 
was a pleasant experience and 1 
came oul unscadied. 



P.T.; This is the pan where you e^ ; 
to say whatever voti want to say. 
E.L.: I think we really need ,in 
assLsiam to student actlvitie^ I also 
think that IPFW has more than 
meets die e)-c. and I am glad I got 
involved and got to sec a lot that 
odier people arc missing out on.

Presidential race starts 
with blatant pandering 
to far right 



Scnaior Dob Dole, a longtime 
Republican moderate unci Ihrcc-

religious right by aiiacking several 
rap performers such as ihe Ghetto 
Boys and Icc-T. Correct us if wc 
are wrong, but to the best of our 
information the Ghetto Boys have 
not released an album in five years. 
E&gt;olc's conviction in 

this "serious" mat- 

Icr is laughable. 

Ever since Dole 
entered the political 
arena, he has been 
known as a moder- 
ate Republican. In

lack of "family values" in its songs. 
This move could backfire on 
Dole, With his past history of mod- 
eration in the Republican party, he 
could face dissension within his 
own voter base. The years of losing 
must have finally caught up with 
Dole since we are 

witnessing such a 

major change in 
political philoso- 
phy. Dole has 
always fought 
vehemently for his 
beliefs and was 
hurt by Ihe pub- 
lic's perception of 
his convictions. 
He has been his-

Christian Coalition. 
This group is the 
same group who 
had Dan Quayle as 
their standard bear- 
er. Obviously, the 
coalition prizes the 
message over the 
messenger. Who 
will be their nc^t 

spokesman, Dustin 

Diamond, (Screech 
from "Saved by the Bell")? 

Dole has regurgitated the tired 
line spouted by Pat Robertson and 
other politicians with a Christian 
agenda. Dole has shown no leader- 
ship in Ibis supposedly "bold" 
move. All he has done is reassure 
the right-wing Christians that Dole 
is on their side. Nearly a year 
before ihe New Hampshire pri- 
maries start and 18 months before 
the general presidential election, 



attribute seems to 
be a qualification 
for Ihc presidency 
today. 

In a fit of further 
pandering, Dole 
made a lisi of 
"family friendly" 
movies. Listed 
among the movies 
was Arnold "the 
Republicanator" 
Schwarzenegger's 
"True Lies." In 
this movie, 

Arnold e:&lt;ecutes 
around 80 Arabs 
while lying to his 
wife about his 
profession as an 
as.sassin for the 
CIA. Dole must 
be expecting some 

serious funds and 

photo ops with Ihc 
big man because this could hardly 
be considered a family film. What 
movie is nenl. Stallone's "Cobra"? 

Schwarzenegger couldn't even 
save "Last Action Hero" from box- 
office doom. How is he going to 
save Dole's pandering campaign 
from crashing and burning? 

If Ibis is the kind of leadership 
we can expect from Mr. Dole, one 
had better gel used to the chant of 
"four more years," 



'bold" move. All 

he has done is 

reassure the 

right-wing 

Christians that 

Dole is on their 

side

Love's dilemma: 
Should you tell on an 
adulterer? 




friend may appreciate the informa- 
tion, or they may resent you for the 
rest of your life for butdng in and 
starling trouble. 

Let me give you a more specific 
example. My friend Holly is dating 
Cheri, a lesbian who uses everyone 
to get anything. Holly knows this 
but refuses to allow her love for 
Cheri to be dented by what she 
hears about her. Let's say you are 
their friend. And you hear that 
Cheri has been cheating on Holly 
with many different people. Is ii 
your place to tell her? 

I think ii is. But do so in a man- 
ner that is caring and supportive. 
Stan off by saying "You know how 
I feel about gossip, but you should 
know what is heuig said." Or 
maybe. "I really want what's best 
for you. that is die only reason why 
I am telling you this." This way, 
you arc noi spreading gossip, but 
informing the person about what is 
happening them. Often, the subjects 
of the talk are the last ones to hear 
it. 

So you decide to tell Holly 
about Cheri's adultery. Holly 
believes you and confronts Cheri, 
only lo be shot down by a denial. 
Holly wants to believe thai Cheri 
loves her and her only, so it is not 
surprising to see that Holly will 
choose to stay with Cheri. 

As Holly's best friend, you want 
the best for her. And you want to 
believe Cheri is being faidiful. But 



you start to compare notes with 
your other friends. ITiey have heard 
these things too, and more. Plus, 
you have been hearing things that 
Cheri has said or done. Do you tell 
her again? 

Be careful. Before you were 
passing on a tip. Now, Holly may 
begin to think that you are out lo 
see [heir relationship fail. If you 
decide to tell her, be confident and 
accurate about your information. 
Take into consideration die source; 
is this person reliable or just a gos- 
sip queen? And be sure to use a 
tone of voice thai is nurturing and 
sincere. If you scream at the top of 
your lungs, Holly may feel like you 
are telling her what lo do. Present 
her with the infonnalion and let her 
make her own decision. 

What if Cheri is not only cheat- 
ing on Holly, but using her for 
fmancial gains and ignoring her at 
the same time? Let's say that Holly 
Iwughi a computer for Cheri to use 
for her school work and Cheri has 
agreed to make the payments on 
Holly's loan for the computer 
Cheri starts missing payments and 
it's affecting Holly's credit. 

You warn to say "Holly, you are 
a blind fool. Can't you see thai 
Cheri is using you for the money 
that you don't really have!" Bui 
don'i. 

At ihis siage. Holly needs a 
friend One thai loves her for who 
she is and not whai she has. If you 
say how you really feel, it will be 
h;ird for her to icmembcr diai. 

The real lesson here is say whai 
you need to say, but do so in a way 
dial will not alienate your friend. If 
he or she does not want your input, 
dien stop offering it. Chances are 
you will eventually see favorable 
results concerning everyone.

Mothers should avoid 
udder embarrassment 




math mouth. I am 

noi shocked 

because I have 
seen this behavior 
before. On my 
grandfather's pig 
farm, I witnessed an 
overburdened sow 
suckling her litter as 
she lay on her side. 
Neither the sow nor 
the graduate both- 
ered to cover the 
squealing infants 
widi a blanket. Five 
years ago, I 
observed two moth- 
ers do the same 
thing at the Fori 
Wayne Children's 
Zoo. One was 
behind the bars and 
the other__was on the 
same side as the 
humans. 

In the days of 
being politically 
correci, 1 may be 
out of bounds, but 
why do women who 
breasi-feed just 
whip il out any 
where and feed the 
screaming infant 
without bothering to 
cover anything? 

Do noi react to this without 
reading the whole article. 1 am all 
for breast-feeding, but there has lo 
be some decorum while this act is 
going on. My five year old son was 




I work In a 

restaurant and 

I see many

proud of her and her 
shameless act of

heaven's sake, cover 
your udder! 

Even my 

sister, when she is at a 
family gathering in 
our parents home, 
puts a blanket over 
the little one's head. 
Even [hough she is 
no .■itranger to us she 
siill has the common

up. We know whai is

the self respect and 
the respect for others

designee, a reprcscniaiive from the Friend,s of IPFNV 
and the last five recipients pf the award looks at the 
nominees and decides who will receive Uie award for 
the next year. 

A faculty member may nominate him or herself, or 
be nominated by any other faculty member or student. 

Anna Sevier. tPFW coordinator for die Friends of 
IPFW, said it is very rare for faculty members to nomi- 
nate themselves. 

Chowdhury said he was pleasantly surprised to 
receive the awanJ. 

He has been working at IPFW since 1970 and has 
laught more than 21 different courses. 

He also helped establish die geogarden outside of 
Ketder Hall, and has worked with the geology industry 
lo acquire various lab equipment for IPF%V. 

Although Chowdhury said he enjoys his research 
and the work he docs for the dcpanmcnt, he said the 
best Uiing about leaching is the students. "When you 
are teaching a difficult subject and you suddenly see 
their eyes light up. That is the most enjoyable thing." 

In addition to his teaching Chowdhury is intensely 
involved in research, fie said he tries to gel his stu- 
dents involved in research too. 

"When they gel involved they see exacdy die prob- 
lem we are Hying lo solve; Uicn they have a greater 
understanding of it." 

Chowdhury said he always includes the names of 
students who have helped considerably with the 
research project in his anitles. 'Thev like lo see their 
names in print." he said

Expectant mothers should limit caffeine; eliminate alcohol 



Vickey (;trard«t, RN 
GuesI Writer 

So, you arc going lo have a 
baby, Congraiulaiions! Here arc 
some helpful tips for you and 
your baby -to-be. 

ll is important lo receive early 
and continued prcnalal care. This 
consists of periodic cxaxninalions 
for determination of blood pres- 
sure, weight, change in the size 
of the uterus, condition of the 
fetus, urinalysis, instruction in 
nutritional requirements, prepara- 
tion for labor and delivery, care 
of the new bom. and suggestions 
and support to deal with die dis- 
comforts of pregnancy. 

Scheduled visits at regular 
intervals offer the opponunily to 
detect any untoward changes in 
the condition of the mother so 
that necessary trcalmcnl can be 
instituted. Regular appointments 
arc very important throughout 
your pregnancy, and usually you 
are seen monthly until about 
seven months, every 2 weeks 
during the 8th month, and every 
week during the last month. 

Pregnancy can be a special 
time in your life. It is more 
enjoyable if you concentrate on 
iiuod nutrition and a healthy 
lifesiylc. In this respect, it is a 
time for not only creating a 
healthy baby, but also for taking 
good care of yourself. 

During your pregnancy your 
body needs more calcium, iron, 
and protein. Also, an additional 
300 calorics are needed per day 
to help support your baby's 
growth and devclopmeni and to 
meet your body's changing 
needs. The key to good nuiriiion 
is a varied diet that includes 
every type of nutrient 
Nutritionists have grouped foods 
according to nutrient content lo 
simplify the planning of a varied 
diet. These foods arc necessary 
for the proper growth and devcl- 
opmeni of your baby. 
Nutritionists recommend one or 
more daily servings from each of 
die basic food groups, which are: 
1. Bread, pasta, and cereals. 2. 
Vegetable group, 3, Fryii group. 
4. Milk group. 5. Meat, poultry. 
fish, eggs, dried beans, nuts, and 
peas. 6. Fats and sweets (use 
sparingly). These foods and bev- 
erages are rich in vitamins, nutri- 
ents, proteins, and calories which 
you and your baby need for 
growth, development, and energy. 
It isn't wise to put yourself on 
a weight controlled diet while 
pregnant, because it is the baby 
who loses, not you. Undereating 
in the early weeks of pregnancy 
could endanger your baby's 
chance of survival. During the 
first 10 weeks of pregnancy, 
undereating can result in a low 
birth weight baby with underde- 
veloped organ systems. 

Weight gain is inevitable and 
necessary lor a healthy pregnan- 
cy and baby. Recommendations 
for weigh! gain depend on both 
your height and pre-prcgnancy 
weight. The Institute of Medicine 
h'as recently revised its recom- 
mended ranges for maternal 
weight gain to 26.5 to 35 lbs. for 
normal weight women, and 28.5 
to 39.5 lbs, for underweight 
women. 

Physical activity is good for 
you in all stages of life, including 
pregnancy. Women who engage 



Technology Fee will 
not be hidden in 
new fee statements 

In the June 1 issue of The 
Communieaior several stories 
incorrectly stated ttiai the 
Technology Fee would be hidden 
in the new fee statements In fact. 
the nesv staiemeou will list such 
fees as lab fees, student activities 
fees, athletic fees and parking fees, 
however, ihc statements will not 
list the cost of each individual 
course. Instead this information 
will be available fiom counselors

: .sort of regular) 
often have easier pregnancies 
and deliveries. Here are a few 
examples of safe physical 
activities: walking, stationary 
cycling, swimming, prenatal 
exercise classes, golHng. and 
bowling. Remember that it is 
important to check with your 
doctor before you begin any 
exercise program. 

During your pregnancy it is 
essential that you not consume 
alcohol. The effects of alcohol 
can be extremely dangerous to 
the fetus. Alcohol use during 
pregnancy can cause Fetal 
Alcohol Syndrome. This has 
even occurred when the modicr 
has consumed moderate 
amounts of alcohol during her 
pregnancy, therefore, there 
simply is no safe level. Many 
physicians have recommended 
that "if you are pregnanl-think 
before you drink." 

Smoking cigarettes also pre- 
sents risks for adequate fetal 
development. Smoking reduces 
the amount of oxygen available 
to the baby and may therefore 
impair proper organ develop- 
ment. The greatest risk for smok- 
ing moms is that tlieir babies may 
be born prematurely. The

Obstetricians and Gynecologists

recommend that women give up 
cigarettes completely during 
pregnancy and breast feeding. 
Women who smoke arc at higher 
risk for miscarriages and still- 
births. In addition they are also at 
a higher risk of Sudden Infant 
Dead) Syndrome during ihe early 
months of the baby's life. It is 
recommended thai nicniinc 



patches not be used during preg- 
nancy or breast feeding because 
nicotine would still be delivered 
to the fetus. 

Caffeine is a controversial 
topic. Some studies suggest that 
high doses may increase the pos- 
sibility of birth defects. 
Therefore, it is best to limit your 
consumption of coffee, tea, car- 



hon-itcd tievcr.igev Lonuinin^- 
caffeine, and chocolate prod- 
ucts. It might K- best to switch 
to decaffeinated products for 
Ihe duration of the pregnancy. 
These precautions will cenainly 
increase your chances of having 
a healthy baby. 

Drinking plenty of tluids is 
necessary during your entire 
pregnancy. You should drink at 
least three quarts of liquid a 
day. including milk, juice, 
water or soup. Liquids will also 
provide the fluids necessary for 
lactation and for preventing 
dehydration. Fluids will also 
help to prevent constipation 
which is a common problem 
during pregnancy. 

Childbirth classes are avail- 
able through many facilities in 
Fort Wayne and are very useful. 
They provide the mother-to-be 
with insight on what she might 
expect during the birthing 
process. Some helpful resources 
which will help ensure you and 
your baby success from start to 
finish include: 

• Maternity exercise program, 
Parksidc c/o Parkview Hospital.

and helps relieve minor discom- 
forts of pregnancy such as leg 
cramps, swelling, and back aches. 
In addition, many mothers report 
that cwrcisc done properly pro- 
vides for an easier delivery. 
Parksidc is one of the best facili- 
ties in the area which currently 
offers a maternity fitness pro- 
gram.
