Acclaimed Harvard profes- 
sor and bcsl-selling author 
Cornel West's approach to par- 
enting and child raising is one of 
poicnant realism. 

West, who came lo IPFW on 
Ocl. 25 lo speak on "The War 
Against Parents." as part of the 
Omnibus Leclure Series, told Ihe 
slandinc-room-only audience 
Ihal child poverty, neglect and 



Ihe ri; 



gangster 



Ihe Unilod Slates were 
the results of parents not 
focused on giving enough lime, 
love and compassion to Iheir 
children, 

"We claim lo be so in love 
with our children, but in the bar- 
baric 20lh century, America has 
one of Ihe highest child poverty 
rates o( all westernized 
nations," he said. 



child poverty rale in America al 
1 7 peiccnl. 

All loo often. West said, par- 
ents are more concerned with 
the 'market-driven economy' in 
Ihe United Slates than with 
child raising. He said, "Because 
parenting is Ihe ultimate non- 
markel aclivily in our market- 
driven economy, il has been 
devalued for a long, long lime." 
Out economy, he said, 'down- 
plays' the importance of essen- 
tial and necessary elements tike 
love, compassion, trust and sac- 
nlice parents need lo give Iheir 
children. 

WesI blamed such behavior 
and philosophy of living (or Ihe 
plight o( American children, 
"Our children are walking 
examples of Ihe impact o( our 
economy," he said. 

WesI said parents could ame- 
liorate the slate al child raising 
and its current outcomes by 
spending more lime thinking 



critic .il I V about how ihey behave 
around their children and how 
Ihey raise them. 

West likened living a lilc of 
thinking crilically of one's self 
and actions lo "dying every day 
and being bom again the next." 
He said, however, Americans 
are reluctant to change their 
ways. "Too many ot us don't 
want to engage in high-qualily 
self-refteclion. It's loo easy lo 
live in denial and to overlook or 
downplay what is happening." 

Al limes. West's leclure look a 
turn lowand his own Ihoughls 
on Ihc Sept. 11 IcrrorisI altacks. 
West said Ihe country was 
"overdramalic in our characteri- 
zation of whal happened." He 
called Sept. II "Ihe end o( 
American innocence." He said 
America, up lo that point, was 
"the only modem nation lo 
believe it began with inno- 
cence." According 10 West, 
Americans otlen deny the histo- 



ry ot Ihe country and Ihe cen- 
liiries of slavery and systematic 
slaughter of indigenous peoples. 

West also presented his per- 
spective on America's inlalua- 
lion wilh gangsters and gang- 
ster-like behavior. 

"Gangster proclivity is a 
human Ihing," he said. "Even 
U5. foreign policy has a gang- 
ster element le II, 

West's book. The War 
Agairwt Parents," co-aulhored 
with Sylvia Arm Hewlett, is a 
study of Ihc difficulties and 
challenges parents face in rais- 
ing children in today's matkel- 
dnven economy. 

In researching ihc book. West 
and Hewlell, who co-chait the 
Nalioful Parenting Association's 
Task Force on Parent 
Empowerment, (ound Ihat 
many children living in poverty 
had (athers who did not live 
wilh Ihem or support them. 

Their molhers. WesI said, 



were oltcn "ovct-vvorked and 
underpaid women with lillte or 
no focus on remedying Iheir sit-

He said America was filled

He believed, however, that 
America could change if il wa.s 
willing lo pul forth the lime and

Plans are in Ihe making for a 
unique new facility that will 
serve as a mullifacelcd resource 
on Indiana politics. The Mike 
Downs Cenler (or Indiana 
Politics, named after former 
IPFW polilical science professor 
Mike Downs, who passed away 
on January 24, will serve as a 
clearinghouse for information 
on stale polilics when it opens 
next spring, said Barbara 
Blauvolt, secretary of the depart- 
ments of polilical science and 

"It will provide communica- 
tion links among Indiana schol- 
ars." she said, "it will be Ihc 
place to go if you want lo know 
somelhing about Indiana politics." 

Downs had been working 
wilh ]udie Violelle, director of 
Helmke Library, on Ihc creation 

before his death. Friends and 
colleagues have carried on 
Doivns' work on Ihe Cenler and 
chose lo name it in his honor. 

From 7 lo 9 p.m. on Tuesday. 
Nov. 6, these same (ricnds and 
colleagues, along with ihe 
department of politieal science, 
will host a fundraiser for Ihe 
Downs Cenler al The Scottish 
Rile Center. 431 W. Berry Street. 

According lo Blauvell. Ihe 
event, called an "Apolitical 
f'arly and Communily 
Convention," will be a parly fol- 
lowed by a "polilical conven- 

The nonpartisan event will 
feature local polilicians Sieve 
Shine and Brian Slier, Mayor 
Graham Richard and former 
mayor Paul Helmke and 
Represen la lives Winfictd Moses 
and Robcrl Alderman. 

Invitations have gone oul lo 
nearly 10.000 Indiana and Allen 
County residents and to former 



idents nationwide. 

Proceeds from Ihe convention 
willgodireclly tothelundingol 
the Cenler. ''We have already 
received nearly SIOO.OOO In 
pledges," said Blauvell, "One 
former student gave us SIO.OOO 
and is considering giving 



inlhcpii.|&gt;.

hoping lli.ii !!"■ I ['&lt;■■ i-.i"i 

project worth supporling." 

The Mike Downs Cenler (or 
Indiana Polilics. to be localed in 
Helmke Library, will start oul as 
a small facility Ihat will grow 
each year. Blauvell said. Initially 
its presence will be primarily on 
Ihc World Wide Web. "We will 
need good technology, a good 
staff and lots of resource materi- 
als. It will lake a lot ol money," 
said Blauvell. 

The goal of Ihe Cenler will be 

10 educate Ihe public and 
encourage active participation 
in politics, acconJing Id Blauvell. 

11 will also have the capacity lo 
help preserve Indiana's written 
and oral histories, as well as 
provide insight into Ihe history 
of Indiana polihcs and ils role in 
national events, 

"We really Ihink il will be a 
terrific resource for IPFW stu- 
dents and Ihc communily," 
Blauvell said. 

Blauvell. who worked with 
Downs for 30 years, said he had

Meet Misly Dawn, a mother, who juggles a lull time college 
schedule while working as a barlendcf a1 a local microbrcwery. 
Misty studies anthropology by day, and serves up hundreds of pinl- 
sizeo glassn of ale by night. Misty also proclaims Ihal she is in lacl 
an ordained witch and proudly sports a lalloo on her upper arm thai 
signifies her beliefs. The cye-calching design is j live-poinled 

cotwcclpd by a circle. Misly says Ihal Ihe symbol has ' ■■'"

Ihe remembrance of those who have passed. 
"It IS a very personal nlual and has different meanings lo dif- 
ferent individuals, dependmg on where one is in life.* explained 
Muly- 

Misly began her clarification of witches with her views of the 
concept of magik. "Magicians perlr 
with Ihe spiriLs of nature Ihnsugh ce 

a personal level." Witches do nol parlicipatc in stances' as 
_!.. .1. _i : ;_.._ Likewise, pagans do not 



c would believe. All pagans share Ihe ci

Misty chuck- 
led, 'but calico 

lo the CoddfSA bi-cause they are three colors. 
Bbck is the color thai signilie^ lemininilv, but three is the number 
that IS sacred because then? are three aspects lo Ihe Goddess, maid- 
en, mother, and crone." A crone is the wisest and oldest of all pagan 
women. Samhain is the lime when the Goddess is in her crone phase, 
hence the images of the 'old hag' tvilch. 

Pagans aUo believe that Somhain marks the time when God is 
igic. Witches get m touch dead and travels to the undcnvorld lo wail for rebirth from Ihe 
both in groups and on Goddess at Yule- It is then that the circle ol life begins again. In this 
._ ._ _&lt; inlen'al. the Goddess mourns the loss ol her consort, which IS prob- 

ably another reason that black is a Halloween color.

"For I

"A coven." she explained "is a group of like-minded individu- 
als who desire to sluay, practice together, and share each other's 
karma." When asked about Halloween, Misty thought il w.is amus- 
ing Ihal Halloween is about witches flying on brooms. 
"Besides, who says we really can't,"shc grincd. 

Misty used lo practice Wicca when she was vounecr, but now 
thai she is more mainslreamed, she proclaims that she is a non- 
dcnominalional wiich. Halloween is Misly's New Year celebration. 
"Halloween is my favorite holiday." she said as she [umpcd 
up and down clapping. "We don't wear funny hals and blow horns," 
cited Misty, "but it could happen!" she laughed. Halloween is called 
Samtlain, (pronounced SUW-in) and means "End of Summer." It is 
oncoltwo"spirilnighls"inMisly'spraclicc. Ihe other being Beltane 
on May 1. 

For pagans like Misty, Samhain is a celebration of death as pari

The degrees are very popular with returning adults but 
recently "more traditional age students have come lo the pro- 
gram, said Conklin, The Bachelor's degree can be used when 
a degree is requited for certain promotions, it can be used as a 
step lo graduate school — even law school, or il can be used for 
people interested in "life long learning." 

Nearly 400 students are curtenlly enrolled in Ihe General 
Studies program This is a 15 percent jump over last year, show- 
ing that the program is Mining popularitv among students. 

Falling under the General Studies fieading, is the PACE 
dcgnfc completion program. The sludenls take a one credil short term, often only 
hour course and a three credit hour course on Monday ni^ts 
and then take one distance learning course of their choosing. If 
the students go year round, a General Studies Bachelor's degree 
with a minor in either supervisory leadership or communica-

One of Ihe most popular Halloween costumes is Dracula. 
Countless movies and books have been written about Ihe blood- 
iucking monster, but few know the true story of Ihe man behind the 



was Vlad, He was bom in 135 
e located between Hungary and the 



Dracula legend. 

The real Dracula's 
Walachia, an independi 
Olloman Empire, 

According to Ihe Vlad the Impalcr website (hltp;//www.roy 
iu/Europe/Balkan/Draculo,html), Vlad was nol bom with the 
c "Dracula.'- Vlad served as a page to King Sigismund ol 
gary The King paid tribute lo the Olloman Empire, but found- 
secrel order of knights to uphold Catholicism against Ihc 
Turks, The secret order was called the Order of the Dragon 

The Vlad Dracula Biography website (hllp://mem- 
bet5.aol.com/johnfranc/drac05.html reports that "Dracul" is Ihe 
Romanian word for "Dragon." Because Vlad enlercd the secret 
Order of Ihe Dragon in 1491. "Dracul" became synonymous with 
his name. The "a" at Ihe end of Dracula docs not appear in Vlad's 
name unlil after his reign over Wolachla. The Vlad Dracula 
Biography (website) cxplaitu Ihal Vlad earned Ihe name Topes, 
meaning "impaler," during his six-year rule because he would 
impale his enemies on slakes. It could take hours for the victims lo 
die. TTie word "devil" was also given to Vlad during this lime. The 
Hungarian word for "devil" is "dracula." 

"Dracula's" reicn over Walachia was bmlal, Vlad the Impali 
website reporls Ihat Vlad "invited many beggars and other old. sick 
and poor people lo a bnnquel al his castle.,, Dracula asked Ihem, 
Would you like to be without cares, lacking nothing in this world?' 
Yes. Ihey said enthusiaslically So Dracula had the castle boanicd up 
and set it on fire. Nobody made il out alive." 

Reports vary as to Ihe number of people Dracula killed during 
his reign. The Vlad Dracula Biography sile reports Ihal Vlad killed 
200.000pcoplc. The Vlad the Impaler sile estimales between iO.OOU 

Vlad apparently died around H76 wtiile ballling Ihe T\irks. The 
Vlad the Impaler site says. "The sultan displayed Dracula's head on 
■ pike in Conslantinople lo prove that he was dead." The sile also 
reports that ewavalions in 1931 of Dracula's lomb in a Snagoi 
off in was missing. 

, Dracula never sucked blood or trans

Ihe mall looking lor the latest 
(all fashions. This year in fash- 
ion )usl aboul anything goes. 
Suede, jeans, leather, sweaters 
and sleeveless- it's all there. 

Sweater- No wardrobe would 
be complete without the ever- 
famous dusler. These long, knil- 
ted sweaters come in every- 
thing from polyester to wool and 
are selling out in scores. 

"The long black [dusters] 
are going Ihe (astesl. We have 
gone through two shipments in 
the past three weeks," tells 
Marney Sluder. manager of 
Lerner New York. 

Another must-have for the 
holiday season is the 1970s 
remake of Ihe caulneck 
sweater. With its trademark 
over-sized collar being loned 
down in size, these sweaters 
are best under blazers and 
jackets. 

'[Caulneck sweaters] seem 
not to be as big and bulky as 
ihey used to be," stales 



surprising in sweater styles lor this , 
season are the sleeveless lurtle- 
necks. Sleeveless turllenecks seem 
to be a little out of place m ihe fall 
season, but are suggested lo be 
worn with a duster instead of Iheir 
usual companion, Ihe matching 
sweater. 

"Don'l be afraid to wear a sleeve- 
less sweater under a long-sleeved 
sweater! Somelimes it's )usl too 
bulky to wear two long sleeved items 
together," says Renee Seaman, 
assislanl manager of Steinmart 
Georgetown. 

Jeans- Jeans have changed a lot 
since lirst designed by Levi Strauss. 
Today jeans come in a vanety of col- 
ors, styles, and labncs 

The most popular jean type for 
this season rs Ihe boot-cut stretch 
novelty jean. Sporting everything 
from glitter to rhineslones, these 
jeans are popular as club atlire and 
for ladies' night out

Colors- Red, gray and black are being 
seen this year more than Ihe usual lall 
colors ol rusts and oranges. 
Why? 

"The movie 'Mulan Rouge' 
has had a big influence on the 
lall (ashions." saysArica Pallock, 
manager of Wet Seal. 

The colors deep red, 
black, and gray are just a few of 
the clothing styles whose use 
and influence stem from the 
movie. 



Dresses- Another remake from the 
1970s, the wrap dress is this seasons

By Renee Thompson, Assislani Editor of 
Special Sections 

Electric blue, reds, gold--Chrislina 
Aguilera's new look? No, just Ihe new 
make-up colors for fall. 

When il comes to eye color, il's all a 
flashback lo the 80s. Eleclnc blue, teds, 
and metallic colors give the eye the dra- 
matic look wanted lor this fall season. 
Even colored mascaras m colors like blue 
and navy are making a comeback. 

"K the eyes are dramatic, Ihen the lips 
are simple.. .you don'l want everylhing 
coming at you," says Stephen 
Laughetberg of Eden Spa and Salon. 

Lips are lo look kissable and natu- 
ral. For the natural lip look try applying a 
lip conditioner, lei it set for 15 minutes. 



Ihen fill in Ihe entire lip wilh a natural col- 
ored lip liner, gloss and go. if liner alone 
doesn't seen to be enough, try applying a 
sheer lip-gloss over the liner. 

"It's not so much the solid-colored 
lipsticks this season,' tells Laugherburg. 
Everyone wants to sparkle lor Ihe holi- 
days, so this year many companies are 
making bronzers lor both Ihe face and 
body These bronzers add just the right 
amount of sparkle and shine to the face. 
Don't gel Ihem conlused with tinted mois- 
turizers, though. These products are sim- 
ply used to brighten the skin. 

"It's subtle during the day. but in Ihe 
evening when you're under the lights, it 
catches the iight and creales a nice 
sparkling healthy glow,' he says. 

The one main thing lo remember 




Some may 
trust in horses, 

some may 
trust in chariots, 

but we will 
always trust 
in the 

name of our 
God.

lor Ihe winter season is skincare. As the 
seasons change so does Ihe skin. People 
put lolion on their bodies but often over- 
look Ihe one area the one area Ihat needs 
il Ihe most, their face. The most beneficial 
thing someone can do is keep his or her 
skin hydrated. 

"Even Ihough your skin is oily, you 
still may be lacking moisture in your skin.' 
says Laugherburg. 

Always remember lo remove all 
make-up before going to bed and only 
apply make-up to clean, moisturized skin. 
Exfoliation is another important step &gt;n 



proper skincare for bolh men 
and women. It is Ihe process of 
removing dead skin cells and 
unclogging pores. While men 
exfoliale most ol their skin while 
shaving they often overlook the 
areas around the eyes, Ihe 
nose, and Ihe (orehead. The 
exiolialion process should hap- 
pen about two lo three limes a 
week, depending on skin type. 

"Make-up only looks as 
good as the skin you put it on," 
Laugherburg says.

Fashion is such a wonderful thing, are also in. Yeah, the belts that used to

thing about tashion. All I know Is that I now label you as a fashion-keen lady Fur 

don't know very much, I like lo be cool and is in as well. Fur on everything. Fur on

your duster, even belter. 

Novelty jeans are 
always in. Lei me 
rephrase thai: This 
month's novelty jeans are 
cool and next month Ihey 
probably won't be. 

Glitter is cool, we are 
told. Putglitler on a pair 
of last year's non-sellers, 
rip out the hem of Ihe 
pant legs, and you have 
Ihis year's hot novelty 
jeans. 

How could denim 
really come back in style 
without a new twist? I 
don'l know if il could. This 
year's reincarnation of 
the denim fad gives 
women less denim lor 
more money. Low-rise, 
ultra low-rise, extreme 
low-rise. They all come ai 
a higher price and con- 
lain less denim. 

Then there are the 
annoying high-rise 

thongs to go with your 
extremely low-rise jeans. 
Seriously, if you want to 
show off youf underwear 
that much, go dance 
somewhere where peo- 
ple want to see that. 
Fashion is something Ihal I don'l

hip on all the latest 
trends, bul some current 
trends I frankly find 
annoying. 

Being a typical 
college guy, I've gained 
aboul 15 pounds and two 
Inches in my waisi during 
Ihe past six months. This 
has meant thai I've had 
lo buy almost entirely 
new panls. I have pur- 
chased two pairs of 
pants in the last two 
weeks, and I am siiil^j_f^Jj 
shaking my head in dis- 

Having three jobs, Na.Cna.n 
I have one gruni job, 
which requires gfu^'DiehX 
clothes. I needed a new 
parr oi work panls. 
Dickies at Wal-Man was 
the obvious solution to 
thai one. Dickies have a 
wonderful reputation as 
a good work pant. 

I also needed 
another pair of jeans to 
replace Ihe tight Levis I 
occasionally struggled lo 
gel into. After visiling 
several stores in the 
mall, I was beginning lo 
understand what it must 
be like for women to shop for jeans. 




By Renee Thompson. Assistant Editor ol 
Special Seclions 

Yes, I was a skeptical at first but after 
one try I was hooked' No. not drugs, I'm 
talking about a new tanning salon located 
on West Jefferson Boulevard. It's called 
Sun IWist Tan and instead of using tanning 
beds, Ihey use a slate-of-lhe-an sunless 
tanning system. Yes, sunless lanning. Bul 
Ms not how It used to be streaky, orange, 
leaving Ihe palms of your hands an odd 
array ol colors, 

I walked in for a normal interview All 
was going well and then Rulhie Barth, 
general manager asks, 'So, wanna give it 
a try?" Sometimes those tew words are 
enough to scare any journalist, bul not 
this one, I'm bold and brave and decided 
to take Ihe plunge. 

After changing, the whole lanning 
process look one minule and left me a 
nice golden brown versus the glass ol 



milk shade I was becommg. I couldn't 
shower lor about eight hours in order lo 
allow time lor the self-lanner lo set. 

ll's cancer free-no bulbs, no UV rays 
Many ol Sun Mist Tan's clients are former 
skin cancer patients. It was astounding 
when Banh said that ore of their youngest 
clients was an ll-year-old boy who had 
had skin cancer from going to Ihe lanning 
beds too much. Several clients are on 
chemotherapy and the process is so safe 
that even pregnant women can use il. 

So you ask, what's the down side? It 
doesn't last as long as a normal tan, only 
live to seven days, and since it's a cos- 
metic product there is a stim chance Ihat 
It will rub off on your clothes. However, 
that's a small price to pay for Ihe assur- 
ance Ihal you won't get skin cancer via 
lanning beds, not to menlion several 
types of fungi like ringworm

too tight in Ihe waist, too tight in the hips, 
or loo tight on my butt, 

I linally found one pair ol jeans that 
III wonderfully on me, I was very pleased. 
I was still Ihin enough to shop at the mall. 

When I got my two new pairs of 
pants home; however, I realized some- 
thing. Quite possibly, I got the high-rise 



what I like and what feels comfortable on 
me. I can'l really understand buying nov- 
elty jeans or a belt with a huge belt buck- 
le. To me, that is the ultimate in uncom- 
fortable. 

The clothes we wear don't have lo 
be Ihe clothes that the tetevision or maga- 
show us. Be yourself, enjoy being
