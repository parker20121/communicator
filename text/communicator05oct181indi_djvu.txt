Cold chases hay fever 




By SUZANNE LOOftQS 

Staff Writer 

As the pollen count goes down, so 
does the number of aiiersy related 
cases at the campm health services 
office. In the 3Cwiay period from 
Aug. ia to SepL 18, the oflice had 15 
regular patients visit for allergy 
injections compared to 19 in the 
same period last jtar, 

Nuree Barbara Kidd said the 
recent cold M-eatber contributed to 
the relief of victims with itchy eyes 
and congestion, symptotns of hay 
fever. "It's not usually until the first 
frost that tt-e see decline In alierar-

For Hoosiers allergic to ragweed, 
this means misery unless they can 
find some relief. Hay fever victims

praying for the fir^t frosL

"rtionment or investing In on air

have less pollen than rural areas, 
whwe ragweed grows more 
abundantly, Isenberg pointed ouL 

Medications including an- 
tihlstamines, decongestants, or 
those a-hlch combine the two, are 
another optional relief tor tbe 
aymptoms of hay fever. However. 
Iseoberg cauLiooed that over-tte- 



counter remedies should be taken 
according to package directions. He 
stressed an awareness of possible 
side effects such as drou'slness. and 
warned that antihistamines and 
alcohol do not mix well. 

For EuffereiB wilh more severe 
EjTnploms, Isenberg recommended 
an allergist be consulted, Desen-

people with allergies to dust and

Allergy sufferers undergoing 
immunai therapy are injected with 
extracts of the allergen In smaD 
amounts to build up the body's 
natural defenses. Dosage is 
gradually increased until the body 
builds a form of immunity. The 
treatment may take weeks, months 

"While undergoing treatment, 
patients may stiQ take medication to

That committee will also continue to 
investigate a petition to designate 
certain areas of Neff and Ketller halls

of the senators is the problem of en-

Left-wing group 
forms at IPFW^ 

By GRETCHEN HOLODICK 
SUff Writer 

"People think we're communists, 
but we're bumanitarlaia at heart, 
idealists concerned about our country 
and our world," said Don Banning, co- 
founder of the youth chapter of Ihe 
Democratic Sodalistic Organizing 
Committee at IPFW, 

Banning, a political science and 
history major, said DSOC began 
nationally in 1973. It claims 10,000 
members. Including Congresamao Ron 
Dellums, D-Califorala, and Gloria 
Steinem, 

At [PFW, the organlMllon is much 
newer At Its Sept, 23 meedng, Student 
Senate recognized the youth chapter as 
an ofricial campus organizadon, 

Dave Falkner is the other founder of 
the group which will have its first 
meeting thesecondweekot October. 

Banning realizes "we might have 
trouble recruiting students into tbe 
' t what they must 
:e IS that there arc left-wing 
IS on all the major campuses 
s the nation. 



"Fort Wayne L 
continued Banning, "isolated from the 
rest of America in cultural and politjcal 
areas. There are doset sodailsts, but 
we have had a hard time recruiting 
them because they fear repercussions 
such as having their names on ttie FBI 
'lilt list.' but tUs just doesn't happen." 

The DSOC chapter at IPF'W will be 
active in the same issues as all other 
DSOC chapters. These Include support 
of the ERA, civil rights, and labor 
unions. "Most importantly, tbe chapter 
will be active in educating and 
organizing its members." Banning 
said. 

"I think this organizatioD is needed 
because of tbe economic realities of 
today and the current government's 
position on social issues, especially 
govcmmenl spending cuts," Banning 
said.

Thousands march in rally 



By WAYNE STEFFEN 



When what t 



naglngE. 



called "the 
rally in American 
history" took place in Washington D.C, 
on Sept. 12. Fort Wayne was 
represented, 

"We went lo protest President 
Reagan's economic policy, speciflcaUy 
cuts In sodal programs and cuts which 
have Instituted high unemployment," 
said Don Banning, a history and 
politicalsdencemajorallPFW, 

Banning was a mong about 500 people 
from local labor, women's groups, and 
the NAACP. who made the bus trip that 
Saturday morning. 

While offidal estimales by the US, 
Park police put the crowd at about 
2EO,0aO, Banning thought there might 
have been more, "I talked lo a D.C, 
policeman who said that the number 
was more like TOO.DOO. He said he had 
been on the force for 20 yeare and this 
was the biggest crowd he had ever 

At the Monument, Banning heard 
such speakers as Lane Kirkland, 
president of the AFL-CIO, Benjamin 
Hooks, National Director of Ihe 
NAACP; Vcnion Jordan, head of the 
National Urban League; and Eleanor 
Smcal. president o[ tbe National 
Organization for Women. 

Banning em^diasized that the point of 
the rally was social, not political. "Ted 
Kennedy was there ol course, and some 
congressmen were milling through the 
crowd, but all ttie politicians who were 
there had to sit in a spedal area and 



"I just don't believe the answer to our 
economic problems Is lying /n n 
drawer In David Stockman's desk." 
Don Banning. IPFW student. 



"This is the first lime in history that 
such a coalition has formed. Labor, 
women, and blacks all gol together to 
protest the way wc feel that both of the 
major political parties have Ignored 
our needs," Banning said. 

Banning hopes that the feelings of 
solidarity engendered by the 
Washington rally will be carried back 
with people and nol left in Washington.

groups since his return. 

Banning would like lo form a Fort 
Wayne Qtizens' Coalition. After talking 
to J. B. Pressy IFort Wayne NAACP) 
HJid Margaret Vidals iFort Wayne 
NOW), among others, be feels that 
response so far has been favorable. 

This coalition would, on a local level, 
bring ti^ethcr many of the groups that 
Banning feels have been forgotten by 
both tbe Democratic and Republican 
parties. "Blacks, labor and women 
could sit down and iron out tbeir dlf- 
ferencsa and make their needs known," 
Banning said. 

"In the past, labor has tradltlacally 



supported the Democratic parly. But 
many don't feci that Uie party has lived 
up to labors' support," Banning said. 

One of Uie goals of such a coalition 
would be to johi with similar gmipa

joyed by their sCodents, Some have

others have incredible computers, 
and still others have cofriers that, 
like the advertisement, are "really

IPFW has Sony televisioosetS- 
Tbe first of two tdevlsion sets 
purchased by the Student Senate

PAGE 1 - THE COMMUNICATOR - OCroaEB 1. 081 

Opinion 



Communicator 
gives policies 



"No one reads your paper and ll's no 
wondcTBlnccall you seem to wrilc about 
!■ Ihe Student Senate." one person told 
the editor of The Communicalor last 
week. 

Another pereon said that certainly we 
could find more importsnl things to 
write about than the things they read 
about in our paper 

While we know thai people do read our 
paper — after all. 5.000 copies of it are 
distributed each week and there aren't 
that niany birdcages on campus — our 
readers' comments and eriliclsins are 
welcomed 

The policy of The Communicalor is to 
present to Its readers the news about the 
things that will affect and interest the 
largest number o[ the people we're 
dedicated to serve — Ihe students of 
IPFW 

We abo believe it is important to tell 
readersthlnga they should know, ever if 
sometimes those things are not 
especially interesting to read about. 

This Is why we have articles about 
Student Senate meetings, Faculty 
Sctute meetings, new academic ap- 
pointments, new administrative policies 
and other such "baring" subjects. The 
decisions made by such groups affect 
IPFW students. 

We believe that many people who read 



The Communicator also realiie the 
importance of our stories and editorials-, 
one look at Ihe many letters to the editor 
we have received has convinced us we 
are writing about things that concern 
many people. 

The Communicator also tries to tell 
you in the first few paragraphs of each 
article what is Important about such 
meetings and events, instead of listing 
what happened in the order in which 
they occurred. 

Tills allows even those readers who 
have limited time to read a story to 
know right away the most important 
things that are happening each week. 

Anyone who wants to give an opinion 
about the paper, good or bad, or who 
wants to comment on one of its articles 
can do so in person at The Com- 
municator Office. Suite 215, Walb 
Memorial Union, or send us a letter. 

All letters to the editor should be short 
and to the polnl. Letters longer than 45 
lines. 63 spaces per line, wiU not be 
published. We also reserve the right to 
refuse to print any tetters we believe to 
be libelous or profane. 

Letters to the editor should also be 
typed, double-spaced, and signed. The 
full name, address and phone numlwr of 
the sender should also be on the letter, 
but only the name will be published. 



Senator explains constitution 



ToUiDEdlior, 

BrucG Clurks 
In hla Sept. 17 letter i 
editor item to Imply (hat 
Ken Schcnk Is sami&gt; son of 
powcr-wlelding despot who 
hM an lllegjilmate Senate lo 
hU pocket. I assure you, tliis 
li not IhccoBo. A3 for anrk'a 
alloHadong concerning 
Sc he nk, these ore almosl too 
ridiculous lo deserve 

There ore several reasons 
supporting the Icgillmacy of 
the Sctialc. TJicy arc Ihe 
■pccinc context lo which the 
Dpeclal election rniulrcmcnt 
applies and sittBlenllallon 
from Robert's Rules of 
Order conceminBquoroms. 

The constitution limits the 

all nine who ran for office 
lost spring were elected. But 
there Is a conslitullonol 
requirement Ihat II nine 
vacancies on the Senate nnd 
SUBOG e&gt;l9t simul- 
taneously ipcclol cleclion 
gholl bo conducled. 
However, the oppiicotion of 
this requirement wos 
questionable In light of the 



election 






slate were publicized prior to 
last sorinK'a election. The 
deadline lor potential can- 
didates to submit pcUUaic to 
run wag ol,so extended, yet 

election doy, Whal good 
would it do to conduct 
another "apecial" election to 
more candidates 

tion that couldn't produce 
enough? It doesn't make 
sense As DonGuf/ey pointed 
out, if the special election 
clause was meant to pertain 
to vacancies due to the lack 
of participation In the 
general elecllon, il «xmld 
have oppcared under the 
election code section of the 



Sandy, the porllamenlarlan, 
classified the Senate as 
belonging to the "le^slative 
assembly" category. 
However, Rotxrl stales "...it 
should be noted that certain 
smaller public bodies aiay 
serve a law-making function, 
yet not assume the character 
of a full-scale legislative 
assembly, aad instead rosy 
somewlial resemble a board 
or the assembly of a society. 
Aa example of such a body 
might tie a city-couoctl or a 
\1llBge board which meets 
weekly or monthly and

Vacancies o 



mined the special election 
claiEC refers to vacancies 
due to QltrllloD and not lack 
ol partlclpaliDn In the 
Bcneral election The 
c[ucstlon that now arises Is 
■Did the nine elecled 
members ol the Senate 
constitute a quarom, thereby 
tegitimiilng their action?" 

In RotjcTl'G Rules of Order 
there are four types ol 
assembly Jeff 



cupations during their term 
ot service." Robert further 
states "Such an assembly's 
membership is limited lo 
persons who are recorded en 
the rolls of the society as 
voting memiMn' in good 
standing." Those who are 
recorded on Ibe roile of the 
society as voting tnembCTS In 
good steading constitute the 
memtKTship. 

Ttx nine senators elected 
last spring were the voUng 
members In good slaodlng 
and at that time coostitutcd 
the membership. They were 
Ihe representation the 



student body produced and 
elected. The quorom would 
then be Ibe majority of these 
roembet* (five or morel. 

The Senate Interpreted the 
require meol for the special 
election lo the context that it 
occurred I don't think lack 
of participation In the 
general elecUon wos an- 
ticipated by the drafters of 
the constitution. It was a 
apedal circumstance and 
was reckoned with as such. 
The tnterprelalion of the 
special election daise and 
subsequent action by the 
Senate (passing Weslriek's 
resolution not requiring a 
special election) was not 
without reason and sub- 
stantLiUon, The Student 
Senate wll] continue to serve 
Ibe student body as a 
legitimate orgoni cation. 

Don Moore 
Studmt Senator 



Reader demands return of student activity fee 



To the Editor 

I want my WO back. The 
Student Senate refuses lo 
make Itself a legal body by 
conducting Ihe special 
election necessary. 
Therefore, all money 
collecled from students this 
(all for Hie actlilly fee was 
laken Illegally. I, for one. 
demand ^t my money tie 



Also, all the money spent 
by the Student Senate since 
last s(B-ing has t&gt;ecn spent 
lilcgslly since there was no 
legal body to aulhoriie these 
expetidituTcs, Unfcrlunalely 
for Mr, (Ken) Scbenk, this 
means he will hove to return 
the "'necessary" (S.OOO 
I system, pay back the 



spent by the Senate. 

In reference lo Holden 
Moecket's letter of 9-Z4-ai. 
he saya of the Student 
Senate, "...a body ot 
representatives acting In the 
Interests of the students, 
protecting their ri^Is,..." 
Fine. Mr, Maeckcr, put your 
money where your mouth Is, 
Or should I say, put MY 
money where your mouth is. 
From your letter, I'm sure I 
&gt;n your full sup- 
the Immediate 



reimburse m enl f a II s t ud en t 
activity fees. 

11 Is lime for the studenls 
of this campus to take action 
against this gross misuse of 
power. All of us have the 
legal right to have our $^ 
returned immcdjalely, Dchi'I 
wait for tlie other guy to do 
something. The Student 
Senate Lteraily ripped YOU 
off. Let the Student Senate 
know that we won 
and lake this.

Filleen years ago, a San 
FYoncisco six'plece bond 
released its first nlbum on

featured a male and a

Lined up in orderly rows,

across Ihe field Of conflict. 
Motionless, as il frozen in 
eternal readiness, soldiers or 
every country and era 

This is the fantasy norld of 
Judge Louis Bloom and 
thousands of other collectors 
of historical mllllary 

What? Bloom, respected 
community leader that he is, 
plays with toy soldiers? 
iflslorlcally. leaders and 
military men throughout the 
ages have been fascinated 
wllh model soldiers and 
games of conflict. Bloom 
said. 






lodel a 



on record have been found in 
the tombs of Egyptian and 
Chinese rulers. Assigned lo 



protect the ruler in die af- 
terlife, some ancient leaders 
were buried with IhoiEands 
of Hies lie clay models. 
Bloom said. 

In more primitive times, 
records Indicate some kings 
were txiried with live 
soldiers and household 
servants. Perhaps l&gt;ccausc 
tills was such a waste of 
valuable manpower, Ihe 
practice ol burying models 
was substi luted for the 
burial of real soldiers. 

During his presentation ol 
the facts and history of toy 
soldiering, at the Fort 
Wayne Hlsiorlcal Museum, 
Bloom noted that because of 

hobby, model prices have 
skyrocketed. A set of the 
most common model British 
soldiers will command a 
hefty $70 to 1150.

There was no doubt that 
the Daisies would win the 
game, as the scorekceper 
chalked up three runs for 
each time Ihe Daisies

Police provide protection, services 



By BECKV DORRILL 

Start Writer 

The major function of 
the IPFW University 
Police and Safety 
department is campus 
protection, said Maurice 
Shady, chief of the 
campus police, but it 
offers many other ser- 
vices to the school also 

The department helps 
during emergencies, 
proi'ldes escort services, 
unlocks cars for those 
who have left keys In 
them, enforces parking 
regulations and runs a 
tost-and-f ound s e rvi ce 

The Univenily Police 
and Safely department 
consists of six foUce 
officers, two student 
patrol officers, a 



secretary, a clerk and 
three student workera 
that manage the officeon 
weekends. 

Shady said Ihe moat 
important thing for the 
university community lo 
know is Ihat Ihe 
university police officers 

graduates of the Indiana 
Law Enfarcemenl 
Academy. 

They aren't merely 
security officers, such as 
a shopping mall might 
employ. Shady said. They 

enlorcemenl equal lo 
those of any state, county 
orclty officers. 
Shady said, however.

"1 



that 



students know this about 
tE, they feel much more 
secure,"Shadysaid. 

The campus police are 
very suict about en- 
forcing parking 
regulations, he said, 
because "the students 
may not know 11, but we 
enforce parking rules as a 
protection tothesludcnts. 
If everyone parked where 
he or she wanted, by the 
day's end the students 
that had parked legally 
would be pinned in."

The Athletic Center, when 
rijially completed, will seat 
l;p to 2,500 people. It will 
contain basketball and 
volleyball courts, a nine-lap 
track, fire racquetball and 
handball courts, loose weight 
equipment, weight machines 
and areas (or dancing 
exercises and gymnastics. 
The building will also have 
on ortUiciill floor covering 
that con be used as a lennls 
court. Workman said, 

"The biggest challenge of 
my job will be to make sure 
thai everything is puperly 

cverybo^'s needs," Work- 
As facltily manager. 
Workman has many goals in 
mind. Among them Is the 
goal of "bcller serving the 
students and staff (or 
alhlelic related activities," 
he said 

Workman's biggest hurdle 
as Ihe Athletic Cmter 
manager Is plain, bul not so 
5imple - to gel Ihe building 
open for use. At Ihls lime, he 
is hoping lo have the building 
open by Ihe end of Oclober. 

The firsl public event 
planned lor Die Athletic 
Center is a basketball game 
belweon Ihe IPFW" men's 
basketball leam and a team 
of louring English nationals. 
The game is scheduled for 
Nov 17 

According to Workman, 
the crew installing the 
bleachers in Ihe building has 
promised only half the full 
number of bleachers lo be 



. IT. Because of 
this reason, a maximum of 
1,2S0 people wUI be able lo 
see Ihe game. 

If more than 1,250 tickets 
are sold. Workman said, the 
game will have to be moved 
to another place— either Ihc 
Concordia Seminary gym. 
where Uie Tuskers used lo 
play, or the coliseum. 

"I am crossing my fingers 
that we will have the place 
opened In lime lor the game. 
We would hope that iheylthe 
bleacher crew) could find 
some addldonal help to 
improve that situation." 
Workman said. 

Despite the possltJe delay 
of the opening ol Uie Athletic 
Center, Workman is nol 
"We have 
_ hutitwillslill 
be worth the wait and the 
delay ol events to gel 
everything right. 

Workman said he has an 
a d eijuat e num ber of ja ni tors , 
supervisors and work-study 
students lo help nui the 
building when it opois, bul 
be also said more part-bme 
openings for this type of 
work will probably become 
available as the j-ear goes 
by. Workman said he needed 
more time lo decide on the 
type of Jobs thai will take 
care of Ihe builtiing's par- 
ticular needs. 

When the building is 
completed, all IPFW iridoa- 
sporting aclivillcs. Including 
the Indoor sports events of 
the Intramural program, will 
take place there. Workman 
said 
Workman also mentioned 



the possibility o( an indoor 
lennls clinic lo be held 
sometime during the year 
and the possibility of a fit- 
ness center "We have 

developing an adult fitness 
center where people can 
select acUvitios that will fii 
their fitness siluation." 
Workman said. 

He added that the fitniss 
center and the indoor tennis 
dlnlc ideas were only 
discussed, nol planned. 

Workman said the use of 



the Athletic Center for other 
university related evenla 
would be discussed if other 
groups and organisations 
inquired about scheduling 
use of Ihe building. 

The day will come when 
Uie Athletic Center will open,
