Adkins, Gounaris challenge for presidency 



by S. Brunt Kelkv 

News t^litor 

and Nol Beckley 

Editor 

I?SGA elections will be held on April 
15-19, and Uic presideniiai candidates 
ire campaigning for the position. 
Kerry Adkins. the former Student 
Activities Board member who filed a for- 
mal complaint against the technology fee 
referendum, has promised to make 
Students Govemmeni more accessible lo 
students Adkins' opponent is George 
Gounaris, director of interior/exterior 
affairs on the president' s cabineL 

The big issue in Adkins' platform is the 



yearly increase in 
without student input, 

"The university has increased tuition 17 
percent since 1993-94," Adkins said 
"There have been no negotiations between 
the student body and the university." 

Adkins also said the university's expan- 
sionist mindset is pan of the problems the 
administration is trying to run the universi- 
ty 100 much like a pnvaie business 

'"Nobody wants lo stand up and do any- 
thing about (the rising costs)," he said. 

Students need lo see what they are get- 
ting for their money 

According to Adlans, tuition and all fees 
arc to increase again by six percent next 
year "It's noi fair to the students for the 



and student fees fees to increase for 



the third straight 
year," he said. 

Tuition and fees 
notwithstanding, 
Adkins said he 
would try to increase 
contact with the stu- 
dents as president. 
One way to interact 
with the student pop- 
ulation at large is through e-mail, he said. 
Through the campus' new e-mail system, 
students could register complaints with the 
president, and he could update them often. 

Adkins' opponent, Gounans. also said 
he would voice student concerns to the uni- 




Adkins 



vcrsity adininisintion 

Gounaris serves 
on the 1PSGA presi- 
dent's cabinet as direc- 
tor of interior and exte- 
rior affairs He has held 
that position since bis 
appointment at the start 
of the sem^sier, 

GounarLs said 
be is not tnlunidated by 
the administration and will eoniinually 
lobby for student issues. 

"The studenLs in my classes know how 
outspoken 1 am against the administration," 
he said. 

"We're not concerned with how the 



Gounaris 



administration perceives us: we're con- 
cerned with how the students perceive us," 
Gounaris said. 

Both candidates will work hard for Ihe 
students, according to Gounans 

He also said he wants to restore the con- 
trol of Walh Union operations lo the direc- 
tor of student activities or to the dean of 
students. Currently. Walb operations arc 
run by the continuing education depart- 
mcnl. 

Gounaris also said he would like to cre- 
ate a radio information system if he is 
elected. The information system would 
advertise only student activities. No admin- 
istration events would be publicized, 
according lo Gounans.

Few students 



using e 



■mail 



Education names new dean 



by Cassie Rftter 
Chief Reporter 

E-mail siart-up has been slow 
smcc the return from spring break. 
According to Ron Cigna, director 
of the computing and data process- 
ing depanmcnt. only 15 percent of 
IPFW students have activated their 
e-mail accounts. 

Several students indicated they 
bad not activated their e-mail 
accounts because of lack of tune or 
other concerns. 

"I plan on activating my 
account, it's just that time is a bit 
hectic nght now," Thorn Dawson 
said. 

"ICsjust not a pnority," Katrina 
Archer said. 

Other students did not activate 
their accounts because they are 
graduaung in May. "I"m graduat- 
ing in May, so (here is no need for 
me to start my e-mail account," 
Bnan Kenworthy said 

Other than the modest number 
of activated e-mail accounUs, there 
have been no major problems in 
regard to the accounts. Cigna said 
there have betn a few minor prob- 
lems, however, such as students 
not clearing out their mailboxes. 

Currently, students who have 
activated their accounts are noi 
able to pull up addres.ses by typing 
in the desired name. However, 
according to Mary Schoeler. man- 
ager of user suppon at the comput- 
ing and data processing depart- 
ment, students will soon be able lo 
acquire addresses from a directory. 



"We are close to being finished 
with a directory. We arc probably 
one week away from being done," 
Schoeler said. 

The only addresses accessible 
are those of the students who gave 
permission, when activating their 
accounts, for their naOie to be on 
the web pagt directory. 

Schoeler also wanted to encour- 
age students to pick up one of the 
free manuals on how to use e-mail. 
The manuals can be found in any 
computer lab. 

Training video's for the e-mail 
can be checked out overnight from 
Helmke The learning resource 
center, located in the basement of 
Kebnkc. will also allow students to 
watch the video's in one of the 
LRC rooms, 

"The better you get at using it 
the more you can do with it." 
Schoeler said. 

According to Schoeler, there 
are numerous e-mail features stu- 
dents are not aware of yet. One is 
an address book feature in which 
students can use nicknames to 
communicate with one another. 
There is also a configuration file 
students can access allowing them 
to have their full name appear at 
the top of anything they send, 

Schoeler also said the bonus to 
the configuration feature is that if a 
student e-mails an adviser, the 
adviser will be able to pull up the 
student's information without try- 
ing to find out to whom the e-mail 
address belongs.

Hierarchy of 
parking needs 



We are excited tbat the new 
Scieno: Building is underway, and 
we undcrsiand the reasoning for 
closing lot #11, an "A" loi. But we 
wonder why "A" and *'B" parking 
exist. Ai any other company, the 
employees must park ai the outer 
limits of the parking lot lo ensure 
the customers the closest access 
possible Bui here, die employees 
((acuity) gel die front spots, mak- 
ing the customers (siudcnis) park 
far away. 



The belter solulion would be 
either to make every spot first 
come, first serve, or offer "A" 
parking al a bigher pnce to anyone 
who is willing lo pay, regardless of 
their status here on campus. (By- 
the-way. the current hierarchy 
ranks in this order the administra- 
tion ai the lop of die ladder, facul- 
ty, staff, and then ihe students al 
(he bottom. ) Ji's tunny bow we 
have to pay this much lo be treated 
as lower class citizens.

Letters to the Editor 



Tech fee 
helps all 

To die edilor 

Inoimally do not respond lo let- 
ters lo the editor, but I've had 
enough. Last week Jack 
Michaels ("IPSGA Does Not Serve 
Public Jnleresi," March 28. 1996) 
wrote a letier to the editor com- 
plaining about how bad IPSGA 
runs All I can say is PLH" UP OR 
SHUT UP! Ii is a bit redundant lo 
hear people complain about ihis or 
that without offering lo help It 
Jack Michaels is so concerned with 
the way things are. then why isn't 
he involved (could it be Ihal com- 
plaining is all he knows how to 
do)? To set the record straight, The 
Communicator has printed many 
aniclcs. opinion columns and let- 
ters lo the editor questioning the 
administration and advocating for 
students' rights. To say in the past 
two years only one voice has done 
diis IS nol only bia.scd but conceited 
and just dead wrong. If Kerry 
Adkjns has been die only voice on 
this campus, then it has been a 
quici year. 

In regards to the technology fee, 



having access lo the Iniemet and e- 
mail has opened a world of 
research possibdities that odierwisc 
would not have been available to 
me . Myself and many of my friends 
enjoy ttiis perk, tfianks to die tech- 
nology fee How does this unlimit- 
ed access not benefit the students'' 
To read Michaels say Adkins felt 
this fee was not in the best interest 
of the students makes me wonder 
who Adkins really represents, if not 
the studenis. As for Uie lack of a 
credit hour cap for ihe fee, last fall I 
attended an open forum to meet ihe 
administration and discuss Ihis 
issue, which was brought up by a 
another student m anendance - who 
asked not to be identified - nol by 
Keny Adkins.

For all those who are so great- 
ly mconvenicnced by having 
lo walk an extra 100 feet: Be 
grateful you are alive and can walk. 
The only people with a legitimate 



I felt a need to clarify some 
points tbat were pnnted in error 
in a letter to the edilor in last 
week's issue ("IPSGA Does Not 
Serve Public Interest," March 28. 
1996) Some would claim thai 
Kerry Adkins" voice is Ihe only one 
that stands up for Ihe students' 
rights, but that would seem to be 
rather misleading 1 have been 
active in various campus activities 
throughout my two years on this 
campus, and Ihe only thing I 
remember Mr Adkins tor was 



questioning the validity of a student 
referendum of ihe technology fee. 
If Mr Adkms fceis ihai Internet 
access for Uic muiIchls i\ not impor- 
tant, mavK' he shnuld open his eyes 
and realise die direciKin this coun- 
try is headed, lliis access has only 
been possible because of ibe 
Technology Fee that he strongly 
opposed. As for voicing concern 
about the lack of a I5-credit hour 
ceiling for the fee, there seems to 
be a mistake, thai Issue was brought 
up in several senate meetings by 
members of die senate I was a sen- 
ator at dial time and die cap recom- 
mended by us was in fact supposed 
to have been a I2-tTedit hour cap, I 
believe we have been taken advan- 
tage of by the university adminis- 
tration, nol IPSGA. They allowed 
IPSGA to adveni.se there would be 
a 12-credit hour cap knowing they 
would implement one. 

Unfonunately letters to the editor 
do nol require that the authors 
check Ihe facts before they write. 
But 1 did nonce tbat some who 
complain never bother to get 
involved by turning in their own 
petition to run for a spot m student

Fast times at by-pass high 

IPFW shortcomings minimal compared to big school woes 




Although I have not wriiien a 
column in several weeks, plea.se do 
nol think there is nothing getting 
under my skin. Because now is the 
time when I can express my griev- 
ances I have a forum which I do 
nol need lo explain — it just is. The 
problem I have is people who 
attend this university, bul still 
deride IPFW as a second-class 
institution From experience 1 can 
lell you, 1 had more lousy profes- 
sors at Ball State dian I ever have at

Nevcrtheless, many odier trans-

Punishment too harsh for Ryan 




The gay communiiy has hccn silent 
during ihc Jack Ryan issue. Ltl me be 
ihc firsi of [he gays lo lend my voice in 
favor of Mr Ryan's re-hiring While 
doing so, Ici me address a subjeci that 
has been neglected by Ihc local media 
covering this conuovcrsy: the black 
opinion 

An African-American friend of mine 
■old me Ihai bis cotmnunily will proie.si 
Ryan\ re-instaicmeni if that's the out- 
come of the hearing of ihc grievance 
commitiec. Hi'- argument was that 
since Ryan made a statement which 
some consider a racial slur, he deserved 
to lose his job no matter how sorry he 
was, no matter how clean his .slate was 
previously and no matter what he had 
done to aid African-Amencans in the 
past. I have serious problems accepting 
this idea. 

I have done much thinking about 
this is^ue smce our conversation. I have 
concluded my friend is wrong because 
Jack Ryan is and has always been an 
ouLsianding member of the Fort Wayne 
communiiy. As one of die founders of 
ihe i-ori Wayne AIDS Task Force, he 
has helped many people who have been 
infccied with die HIV virus, many of 
whom are African American. Jack 
Ryan's slate was so clean that one 
could see righl through il. like a thin 
plate of glass. 

Jack Ryan did nol mean to offend 
lie has admiilcd to saying &lt;and I am 
paraphrasing) thai speakers must make 
ihcmsclVcs 'memorable on their own 



merits, not as a result 
of race, si/e or gen- 
der A siudcni accused 
him of saying she 
must speak like a 
white person in order 
to succeed in society; 
however, he claims 
only lo have said she 
must speak profes- 
sionally If he said 
this, I am guessing he 
was offering his per- 
ception of societal 
standards, not bis 
own. Unfortunately, some employers 
give preference to minorities who have 
best assimilated inio while society. 
(Think aboul those enleriainers who 
have been accused of acting white: 
Whitney Houston, Oprah Winfrey. 
Diana Ross. Michael Jackson One 
might point to their massive successes 
in support of Ihe crude thinking that 
blacks who act white gain wider 
appeal ) Ryan was not trying to insult 
anyone; he was merely trying lo ensure 
every opporlunity possible for those 
entering the work force, He worded ii 
poorly but has admitted to that mistake. 
which brings me to my nent point 

Jack Ryan apologii^ed for his error 
wilh great sincerity. What kind of soci- 
ety do we live in where a mistake costs 
a dedicated employee a job or. as in 
Ryan's case, a reputation? This 
depends on the mistake The drunk cap- 
tain who crashed the Exxon Valdcx 
most definilely should have been fired, 
even if that was his only mistake. Mr. 
Ryan said he was sorry and he meant it. 
We are not talking about Mark 
Fuhrman here; to my knowledge Jack 
Ryan has never before been accused of 
racial prejudice He has been a fnend to 
the HIV/AIDS communiiy for many 
years, a communiiy Ihat is comprised 
of many minorities. How much does 
one have to do before he is considered 
a good man? What does it take for 
someone lo pnave he is not a racist'' 
For those of you who feel Jack Ryan 



got his just desserts, let me ask you 
ihis: should JoyceijTi Elders have been 
fired? She did nearly the same thing 
She said something many (not just one 
person) found offensive. If that is all it 
takes to get someone terminated, is ii 
possible for me to get Jesse Helms 
fired^ 

The student who has caused such a 
furor is one many would find a threat lo 
socieiy. She has an extensive police 
record (and I have seen the police 
reports) thai includes robbery and pros- 
titution By society's standards she is 
not credible In what oiher situation 
would this woman's accusations have 
been accepted wiUiout clarification or 
investigation? But in the world of acad- 
emia that is what happened. She not 
only got her way regarding the mailer, 
she was paid S9.5O0 to remain quiet. 
With all of the media attention sur- 
rounding this case, it seems die money 
was not a wise investment on the uni- 
versity's pari. 

None of this seems to add up and I 
wish the African -American community 
could see what I see. Jack Ryan is a 
generous man who made a mistake and 
is paying a heavier pnce than neccs- 



Line-item veto welcomed 



S. Brant 
Kelley 




Inside the halls of Congress is ihe greatest 
concentration of Ivy League graduates and 
Rhodes Scholars the world has ever known All 
the bookwork finally accounted for something 
last week. 

Our elCiited representatives, now Republican- 
dominaied, finally forwarded to ihe president a 
long-awaited line-item veto. 

Naturally, the Dems came out against it en 
masse Citing fears of presidential power, more 
vocal Democratic leaders have referred to the 
legislation as unconstitutional. It is interesting 
lh.it the parly least interesied in following long- 
laid rules begins refer 
ring to the Consiiiuuon 



now. 

Also, while a Democratic- controlled 
Congress could only spend this country 
deeper into debt, the new Congress has 
given the executive the single mosi effec- 
tive cost-tutting power available to this 
country. 

Republican leaders have expressed 
concern ,itK)ut giving a line-item veto to a 
Democratic president; the basis of diose 
fears are real, but the bencfiLs to a line- 
item veto package far outweigh Ihe liabil- 
ities which come with one party or the 
other bemg in office 

To Ok public, whom the govemmenl 
now owes almost S5 trillion and il may be more 
thanks to another debt limit increase law. this 
among odier things should be a welcome change. 
Our elected (and indoctrinaled) representa- 
tives finally showed a sense of public morality. 
Sooner or later, diey may even begin niniung the 
govemmenl like a standard buMucss I hen again, 
maybe not: if a business owner had operated like 
Congress, he now would have declared Chapter 
13iwice in the last 15 years 



saiy. This punishment is belter 
for Marge Schott than Jack 
Ryan (of course Ryan 
doesn't own bis own univer- 
sity). 

I am nol surprised my 
friend said blacks support 
the accuser as much us 1 am 
surprised by the lack of 
explanation from diis admin- 
istration. 1 am so disappoint- 
ed with Chancellor Wariell 
that 1 can't approach him 
regarding the matter. He is 
the leader of ihe pack here 
and he should be tJie one to 
do the explaining, noi 
because he has to (because 
he doesn't) but because he 
knows those of us who are 
concerned deserve an expla-

i/s^ ^, 



students participate in Prench poetry exibition 



^ 



by Andrew Voder 
Starr Writer 

J "" ^ he 1996 "Concour« de 

/ Rccjialicn de Poeiic 

J-tarcai!«" (the annual 

pocuy enhibilmn/tompe- 

tition) began with a "Bonsoir and 

Welcome," by Vice President of 

Cercle Krancais Audrey Osborn. 

Room G21 in Walb Union was 

filled with the excited and nervous 

cbailcr of students, faculty and 

judges 

The poetry contest is bcid every 
year in March and is open to anytme 
who wants to compete The only 
re^tuinnent is that the work has to 
be in iiench and it must be memo- 
n/cd There arc three categories that 
the entnes are placed into to facili- 
tate fair judging: First Year. Second 



Year and Third and f-ourih Years 
Panicipants are judged on the basis 
of pronunciation, intonation and 
interpretation of the poetry 

Of course, not all of the work 
recited was poetry First year 
French student Jenny Oney per- 
formed a splendid acapella rendi- 
tion of Boublil and Natel's "L'un 
vers L'autre." which warmed the 
soul. Another variation on the tradi- 
tional poetic format was a dramatic 
dialogue on croissants bciwcen sec- 
ond year French students Carla 
Gierhan and Karyn Smith. 

Whether in song or in verse, the 
IPFW studenis who compeied last 
Thursday were full of creative ener- 
gy that literally flowed out mto the 
audience This enthusiasm, accord- 
ing to Nancy Virtue, assistant pro- 
fessor of French, is what drove her 



to organize the poetry exhibition 
this year. Her desire is to build on 
the energy and enthusiasm of last 
year and to encourage students to 
do their best. Virtue organi;ed the 
event with the help of Laurie 
Corbin. assistant professor of 
French and organizer of last year's 
exhibition Associate faculty mem- 
bers Rose-Aimfie Builer, Jerry 
Weiss and Ingrid Widenhom-Smilh 
helped with the event 

Virtue IS an adviser to Cercle 
Frsnv^s, which is cunently without 
a president. TTie club made a dona- 
lion to the exhibition to help pay for 
the prizes, as did the department of 
modem foreign languages. The club 
also sponsors a fihn series, 

. In addition to Cercle Francais' 
sponsorship, the modern foreign 
languages offices and the School of 



Arts and Sciences sponsored the 
event. Refreshments were provided 
by Arts and Sciences as well. 

Receiving honors for their pre- 
sentations were in the First Year 
division: Camille Grablc for "Le 
Corbeau ci le Renard. ' Chaz Nol 
for "Familiale" and Faramond 
Tourney for "La Mori de Roland." 
In the Second Year division, win- 
ners were Nicole Moore for "Mcs 
Occupations," Valentina Parissi 
Texera for 'Le Corbeua el le 
Renard" and Kimberly Weber for 
"Dejeuner du Matin " Rev John B 
Adde-Nweah took honors for 
"Afriquc," as did Elizabeth Builer 
for "Billet du Malm." and Rcba 
Lauren for "Mon Rcvc Familier" in 
the Third and Fourth Years divi- 
sion.

Playing the chizmp 



Curt 
,. Bohrem 



1 was visiting some fnends at 
Ball State over the weekend when it 
all began. I was in my fnend Lee s 
room watching TV when his room- 
mate Brett burst in with a basket- 
ball. 

"We're getting a game together," 
he said to me. "Wanna play?" 

Let me point out now that 1 love 
sports. Granted I know nothing 
about who won the last Stanley 
Cup. You'll certainly never gel an 
argument from me on the pros and 
cons of the designated hitter rule in 
baseball It's the playing that's 
important. Considering I play sports 
as well as a blind chimpanzee on 
crutches. 1 often gel left in the dust. 

Anyway. Lee didn't want to 
play, but I did. The first thing I 



needed lo do was 
change clothes My 
sweater and blue 
jeans weren't going 
to cut il on the couri. 
I borrowed a pair of 
shorts obviously two 
sizes loo large bul 
didn't have time to 
be nit-picky I didn't 
own any of the ultra- 
intimidating "No 
Fear" or "Big 
Johnson" T-shirts so I opted instead 
to bust out my ragged Spider-Man 
shin. Of course, it wasn't unul after 
I reached the court that I noticed I 
was still wearing my hiking boots 

Common practice on university 
campuses is for students to provide 
ID before using certain facilities. I 
decided to use Lee's. Jusl to clear 
up matters. Lee is an Asian name; 
Curl is German. You figure it out. 
So a weak yet well-constructed plan 
involving an upside down handling 
of the ID and well-placed thumb 
over the picture was forged. 

Five minutes later and we were 
at the gym. The attendant took the 
ID and said nothing as she filed il 
with the rest and returned to her 
books I was in and the same was 



ready lo begin. 

Warming up, I watched as my 
firsi four shots cleared the basket by 
about two feel and realized that 1 
was as warm as I was going to get. 

So the game began. After watch- 
ing me during warm-ups, a person 
we'll call "Cool Guy" chose to play 
against me. Cool Guy was fast and 
skilled. 1 was nol. 

Somehow I managed to ke«p up 
with him, but I did little to slop him 
from scon ng He laughed and gloat- 
ed like a cra/ed, toothless man high 
on paint thinner I grew increasingly 
disgusted. I upped my level of 
intensity, managing to score a few 
poinLs of my own and hurt myself 
only once. 

Time was running out My team 
was only Iwo hoops away from vic- 
tory. Cool Guy. obviously uninlimi- 
daied by my clothes and dumb- 
founded by my playing strategy, got 
cocky 

1 had the ball. Everyone else on 
my team was tied up and couldn't 
get open. It was just me and Cool 
Guy. A slow-motion scene began lo 
unfold in my mind. My eyes 
scanned for help. None. Cool Guy's 
voice was taunting me. It was as if 
my life were an ABC Afterschool 



Special titled "The Boy with Lead 
Feet," So I set my feet and shot the 
ball, 

SWISH! 

Cool Guy stood in awe. A fast 
break followed and they missed 
We got the ball and ran it back for a 
victory. We won. 

So, il was all over Cool Guy 
stood flattened. His arrogance bad 
been partly responsible for their 
loss. The boy-with-no-game had put 
him down. So he tried to play it off 
and be cool like Fonzi He walked 
over, extended his hand lo give me 
five and said, "Good game, man." 

So 1 slapped his outstretched 
hand and gnnned. It feels good to 
know that even for just one minute 
you're better than another human 
being. Especially someone like 
Cool Guy, Ah. sports, you've got to 
love it, 

Tht napies have been ikanged 
lo protect the it

Ministry group travels south 



by Rebtcca Kocnig 
SurrRtporttT 

Over spring break IPFW's cam- 
pus ministry group went on a mis- 
sion trip. This year, the trip was to 
Ihe Sea Islands. South Carolina. 
While there, members helped area 
people by tutoring at local schools 
and repairing local houses. 

The group of volunieers con- 
sisted of 69 people, including the 
staff. The event look about a year 
to plan. According to Denise 
Gemha/dt, admmistrative assistant 
of campus ministry, the most diffi- 
cult thing about planning the trip 
was coordinating all five participat- 
ing campuses and then finding 
housing for the large group. A total 
of seven Christian organizations 
from the five campuses attended. 
Working lo coordinate the trip were 
Reverend Cheryl Peterson, Campus 
Ministry's m-house minister Sister 
Mary-Beth Marun. mmster in focus 
with the Newman Group; and 
Gemhardt. The Newman group is a 
larger Catholic group and only one 
of the groups Campus Ministry is 
associated with 

lie students divided into nine 
learns. Two of the teams focused on 
tutoring students. In coordination 
with the Sea Islands schools, the 
Campus Ministry teams entered the 
schools and helped insijuct the stu- 
dents. This is difficult for the group 
to plan, Gembardi said, because 
after the location of the trip is cho- 
sen. Campus Ministry must contact 
the schools and have the tutoring 
approved. 




The construction teams made 
repairs to homes for owners who 
could not afford them without 
assistance Some of the teams did 
basic work to bring homes up lo 
construction code. Others worked 
with homes damaged by fu^e. One 
home was partially burned two 
weeks prior to the trip and the 
occupant was unable to live in the 
home. Campus Ministry members 
helped rebuild the house 

According to Gemhardt. fellow- 
ship was a positive pan of the trip. 
She also commented that she best 
enjoyed '"the opportunity to serve 
people who needed it These fam- 
ilies were low-income and could 
not have afforded the repairs " 

One of the most unique aspects 
of the trip was that it was entirely 
funded by the Campus ministry stu- 
dents attending. First, fund-raisers 
helped supply some of the money 
lor the tnp Many people also made 
private donations. The rest of the 
money came from the participants 
themselves The money paid for 
transportation as well as all sup- 
plies used on the trip, including 
building materials used by the con- 
strucuon crews. 

Campus Ministry is a non- 
denominational Christian group 
and a division of Fort Wayne 
Campus Ministry.

Legal problems plague NFUs top teams 




Travis 
Stahl 



As a ftwtball fan ii is al^vays tun 
to hear ulk of the Superbow I in Ihe 
middle of April. It is twite as satis 
fying as a Cowboys fan. However, 
the talk surrounding both the 
Cowboys and the Steelers m the 
past week has been sickening 

Michael Irvin has been described 
often as a model titizen 
who IS willing to gi%e 
money not only lo his 
large family but also to 
the communilv in which 
he grew up Last wetk 
two women wert. anested 
in a hotel room and 
charged with possession 
of cocaine and manjuana Big deal 
nght? You bci the room was Rgis 
tered to Irvin who was with former 
Cowboy Alfredo Robens 

How do you suppose those peo- 
ple associated with Irvin for charity 



purposes feel 
seeing him 
indicted for 
possession of 
cocaine and 
marijuana' 
Irvin now 
faces jail lime 
and a suspen- 
sion from the 

This is 
not the first 

problem of this 
nature to arise 
for the Cowboys. Erik Williams 
totaled his car in the middle of the 
1994 season while he was driving 
drunk and then was charged with 
sexually assaulting an underage 
woman. This season three more 
phVLrs. two of whom were starters. 
were arrested for 
testing positive fur 
marijuana use. It's 
Mones like these that 
make me not so 
proud to call myself 
a Cowboys fan. 

Things have been 
equally troubling for 
tht Pittsburgh Steelers during the 
oft season, as well. On Saturday 
star running back Byron "Bam" 
Morris was arrested after police 
found SIX pounds of marijuana in 



the tnink of his car. Morris will be 
suspended by the NIT, for at least 
the fust three games of next season 
and will still face criminal charges 
It was also revealed that, while in 
college ai Texas Tech. 
Morris was the recipient 
of an illegal loan that he 
never paid back. 

As 
Dallas, thi 
not a n 
problem for 





Eric 
Greene 
was suspended 
for testing positive 
for cocaine use in 
each of bis first two 
seasons. So when 
the Steelers elected 
not to resign Greene it 
was supposed to indicate 
that the team was trying to 
cleanse its image The Steelers also 
have had at least one player sus- 
pended in each of the last two years 
for illegal steroid use 

For whatever reason, certain 
players feel like they cannot be 
caught by the NFT. drug testing sys- 



tem. Those players who were 
caught cannot accuse the system of 
being inaccurate because no other 
teams in the NFL have had these 
substance abuse problems 

IVciphcring where the problems 
for these two teams 
started is impossi- 
ble. Both need 
to find an end 
to ihcir prob- 
lems and 
soon, howev- 
er, if they 
want to make it 
back to the Supetbowl. 
Some people have 
speculated that the 
problems with the 
A l^P ) Cowboys arc directly 
V . _^ linked lo Barry 
J ~.J Swii/or's leniency. 

^^ That may be so, but Bill 

Cowher is no pushover 
when it comes to discipline, 
so what is the Steelers excuse? 
If too many more players from 
ihese two teams arc arrested, they 
will have to stan playing in a differ- 
ent NFL. the Narcotics Federal 
Lockup.

Spring brings on 
an itch for baseball 




.Spnrtshdilnr 

Ahhh, spring! Il is a season filled 
with renewed life and reborn disillu- 
sion. It is the lime of year when by 
God's grace wc can once again lake 
in Ihe sights, sounds and scenis o( 
baseball Whether ii's at the profes- 
sional level, ihe Liiile Leagues or 
anywhere in between, there just isn't 
anything like being ai Ihe old ball- 
game- 

The smells arc magnificent 
Sleamed ballpark holdogs have no 
equal and the musty odor of sL'ile beer 
bnngs back memories by the do«n. 
Ihis is the lime of year when men 
reium to childhood dreams and their 
sons scramble to snag an autograph or 
two during balling practice. Ii is also 
the season when women begin form- 
ing "baseball widows" support 
groups. 

Unlike football, baseball has no 
colorful names for the players. There 
are no tight-ends or wide-outs. In 
baseball you can go long, however. In 
the immortaJ words of Harry Carey. 
"Il could be... it might be. it is, holy 
cow 1" 

Baseball is a sport unlike any 
oiher. It is slow, it is methodical and it 
lakes forever to play a game. In recent 
years the powers thai be have made 
adjustmenis aimed at reducing ihe 
lime it takes to finish a typical ball 



game. Rarely have 
their efforts done 
much more than 
further confuse die 
game 

So in a 
concentrated effort 
10 bring the sexes 
together in the 
name of the great 
American pastime, 
here is one guy's 
recommendation: 

Take Ihe 
iiine 10 etpiore the world of baseball 
if you are noi familiar wiih it. I know 
a loi of women who love the game. 
much 10 the chagrin of their lovers. 
On the other hand there are even more 
men who cannot live wiiboui ihe 
game and put it before even life itself 
ai limes, I am one of those die-hard 
fans. 

Aboui Ihis time of year I begin to 
gel that iich. noi THAT iich, but the 
iieb for nine innings of baseball A 
seal at the ballpark, a cold draft in one 
hand and a sloppy ballpark frank in 
the other, the scorecard wedged care- 
luUy inio my armpit and a pencil dan- 
gling from my moulh. 1 am ready lo 
partake of the game How could any- 
one script a more perteci day than a 
day ai the ballpark? 

Nine innings or so later, I am 
slighdy lighi headed, my throat is dry 
and scratchy from yelling at the lop of 
my lungs, and I really have lo take a 
le^. The camaradene of a ballgame 
is unmatched by any other sport. No 
matter your social, economic or ethnic 
background, a person fits in ai the 
ballpark, except of course at 
Chicago's Wrigley Field where ihe 
once famous "Bleacher Bums," an 
unruly band of fans, has become a 
drunken masi of yuppie-hood. 

Baseball is America. America is 
baseball and even for fans of teams 
that traditionally find themselves in 
the proverbial cellar, baseball is life.
