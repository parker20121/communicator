Police check for bomb during 
recent bomb scare episode . 

Bomb Scare Hits 
Area Colleges 

The Regional Campus 
experienced its First bomb. 
scare Thursday, October 22. 
At 9:00 a.m. an anonymous 
caller told the Fort Wayne 
Fire Department that bombs 
were planted at the Regional 
Campus and Saint Francis 
College, both bombs set to 
explode at 11:15 a.m. 

This resulted in an 
evacuation of the buildings 
at 10:00. The alarm bell 
raag and many people, 
thinking it was only a fire 
drill, left the building with 
their books, purses, brief- 
cases, etc. still inside. 
Once they walked outside, 
they discovered that the 
campus would be closed 
until 12:30. The students 
made the best of it, though, 
by cither studying on tbe 
lawn, leaving, or playing 
football unconcernedly on_ 
the lawn. 

The Fort Wayne police 
department. Fire department, 
and the university staff 
members sealed the building 
and began a thorough search 
for the bomb. The 50 
searchers combed the build- 
ing until 11:00 when every- 
one left. Their biggest pro- 
blem was their confrontation 
with many locked briefcases 
left by students with their 

At 11:00 a.m. everyone 
moved away from the build- 
ing to begin a wait. The 
building just stood there de- 
fiantly.

given the honor of being 
the only students to par-

Health center in the state 
of Indians. The two girls 
worked there as part of a 
mental health course in

the center cams an equi- 
valent of one credit. They 
excelled in their work and

GIRLS TEAMS BATTLE 



The long awaited flag 
football game finally took 
place this weekend. Team 
G, the headstrong group of 
about nine girls which has 
yet to win a game, did furi- 
ous battle with the super 
Beavers, or Team H. The 
Beavers were at a definite 
advantage from tbe begin- 
ning for several reasons. 
First of all, Team H had at 
their disposal an entire book 
of high.schoob football plays, 
while Team G was limited to 
only the few that they al- 
ready knew. Also, for those 
of you who read the publicity 
on tbe Beavers, you know 
that they had the moral sup- 
port of several rather immo- 
ral cheers. Teem G bad just 
finished practicing before 
the game, and with no repla- 
cements available all the 



girls bad to start the game 
and play it in a completely 

It seems that the ref- 
erees neglected their duties 
and only called off-sides 
throughout the game. Team 
H resorted several times to 
verbal profanity and pulled 
hair and used, unnecessary 

As a result. Team G\won 
ihe game by a score of 24—0, 
During the first half. Team 
i\ mode one touchdown and 
ran tbe extra point. They 
intercepted a pass in the se- 
cond half aud ran for another 
TD and again ran the extra 
point. (No kicking ability, 
apparently) The final score 
was topped off by another 

It looks like the quan- 
tity triumphed over quality 
this time.

The Men who both lived deep faith and influenced his- 
tory for better days, such as Socrates, were both open to truth 
and willing to die for it, be in, respect for law or respect for 
people. Therefore (here is reliability in the kind of religious 
knowledge that lays central stress on the believing life, the 
open mind, and the compassionate heart. The interpretations 
vary, often sharply, but such relativity of reported knowledge 
gives way to the central reliability of the kind of life they 
led and the rightful implications which can be drawn from their 
lives. Thus in the case of Socrates, Jesus and Buddha, for in- 
stance, interpretatioas of reality, centering in their kind of 
life and in the implications of their lives, become dominant 
aspects of religious faith. Integrity and concern join in witness 
within and beyond high-grade religious experience.

is 815.00 per semester. Ap- 
proximately 2,800 students

clearly have the support of 
the majority of students in

Letters 
to the editor 



Dear Editor, 

I would like to reply to 
some of Mr. Braun's (Com- 
municator 10-16) "exten- 
sive research" and his as- 
sumption that E. Ross Adair 
is best suited to serve the 
Fourth District. 

First of all, it is false 
to assume that any person 
elected ten consecutive 
terms to Congress is in 
"step with people." That is 
no "political fact." What it 
docs mean, however, is that 
the person conies from a 
"safe" district. The Con- 
gress is full of them (both 
Democrats and Republicans), 
and these people are elected 
year after year because of 
their party affiliation. The 
South ib a prime example of 
these kind of polities. It 

mous political hacks which 
include Rep. Rivers, Sen. 
Eastland and Sen. Stennis. 
It is a fact, though, that in 
the past 32 years only one 
Democrat has been elected to 
the He 
1948 v 
all ov 

cently. The Wall Street Jc 
nal (09-08) published an

Mr. Braun also wants us 

to believe that Mr. Adair has 

the fight against pollution. 
Anyone cheeking the voting 
records of the candidates 
will note that Mr. Adair's 
record leaves much to be de- 
sired. In the past two years 
Mr. Adair has shown a re-

Mr. Braun claims that 
Representative Adair has 
voted for reductions in our 
Space program so he could 
put that money to help solve 
our pressing domestic pro- 
lems. Mr. Adair served oa 
the House Committee of 
Science and Aeronautics 
(like his opponent) and may- 
be he doesn't understand the 
challenge and the necessity 
of space exploration. For 
some reason Mr. Braun fails 
to point out some of the bills 
Mr. Adair has voted for to 
solve some of our "grave 
domestic problems." I can 
mention a few he has voted 
against: poverty programs, 
rat extermination, education, 
urban mass transportation, 
the Family Assistance Plan. 

Is Mr. Adair really serv- 
ing the people (as in "We, 
the people...")? I think the 
Fourth District can do belter 
than that. On November 3 
the "people" will go to the 
polls. I am confident they 
will vote for a change.

added that it would also 
afford marketing professor; 
and students an opportunity 
to confront a current and 
unique business problem in 
the classroom. 

Dr. Person will utilize 
the project in two of her 
classes— buyer behavior and 
advertising. la the farmer, 
students will develop cri- 
teria that would indicate 
who is likely to-buythe car 
and determine ways promo- 
tion to the youth market as 
well as other possible mar- 
kets might increase sales. 
In the advertising class, 
students will prepare a 
questionaire and conduct 
interviews to determine how 
people respond to adver- 
tising relating to the Pinto. 

Assisting Dr. Person 
in the project is William G. 
Heller, lecturer in business 
administration at I.U. here. 
Heller will employ the pro- 
motion in his marketing re- 
search class. Students will 
be divided into three teams 
to conduct a first impres- 
sions survey, a performance 
test, and to gather a profile 
of the Fort Wayne campus 
concerning kinds, of cars 



driven by student 

culty. The latter 

result in discovering any

Each university parti-
