music and talk varicly show that Simmons 
feels listeners wiU enjoy. The personalities

Along with ibe ctiange in its DJs, Storm 
106 brought a complecely difTcrent sound of 
music Everything from mudern rock to alier- 
naiive and ei^y-listening is heard by ihe lis- 
tener. 

"We were very diverse, introducing a lot 
of new music." said Shawn Smyth, program 
director for 96.3 The Edge. "It was new as in 
old and not heard and new as in new."

Last week on Sept. 25. the Killer Bee 
radio station. B106, changed fonnais and 
became Ihe Storm Instead of being leen-on- 
enied, Ihe station has now altered its attention 
towards the adult generation. 

"We didn't want to focus on die kids any- 
more." said Trip Simmons, the program 
director of ihe Storm 

According to Simmons, the alteration 
was made ai a result of a management deci- 
sion based on decreasing ratings and a lack of 
advertising revenue With hopes of gaining 
listeners, the station now „_^^^^^^^_

Students, faculty to read literary works 



by Josh Sprunger 
Staff ReporUr 

Can't gel into it by reading il? Try lis- 
tening to it instead. 

On Monday, Oct 21. from noon to I 
p.m., Mary Ann Cam, assistant professor of 
English and hnguistics, will be reading one 
of her own short stories in Walb MemoriaJ 
Union, Ro(Hn 224 Her reading is one of 
many in a series that is free and open to the 
public Cain says thai she Ls still deciding 
between two of her woiks, and that the 
readings each semester conLnue "a iradi- 
Lon among student writers." 

"This is a year-long series in which 
both siudenl and faculty writers read origi- 
nal works," said Cain. "Publication is one 
oudei for original work, but another is lo 
read to an audience " 

Helen Frost, a visiting instructor of 
English and mterim director of the Wnling 



Center, is presenting some of her poetry on 
Monday. Nov. 18. from noon lo 1 p.m. Her 
reading will take place in Walb Memorial 
Union, Room G21, 

The IPFW Student Readmgs. in which 
students may present anything from fiction 
lo creative nonfiction to poetfy. are going lo 
be held on Monday. Dec. 2, from 1 1 a.m. to 
1.30 p.m in Walb Memorial Union, Room 
224. Students who would like to sign up 
must contact George W. Kalamaias, direc- 
tor of creative wniing, by calling 48 1 -6841 . 

"One reason to go is that it is a much 
different feel to hear Ihe work in the 
author's voice," continued Cain. "You bear 
them living it - which is a whole other 
dimension of performance. It's not like a 
play, and it lakes place in a simple meeting 
room." 

Often afier the readings ihere is a shon 
question and answer session with the 
author of the reading. These sessions are 



not crttiijues, but reactions to the work. 
Sometimes, accordmg to Cain, the sessions 
don't last long. 

"Many times the audience just has 10 go 
home and mull it over. The authors often 
make them tboughilul. and the words come 
later." Cain said 

Abo dunng die semester, Ihere will be 
visitmg wrilers that will come to IPI^ 
from all over the country lo read. The 
readings will be broadcast on Public 
Access Channel 6 under the title. 
"Contemporary Literature." Viewers 
should consult the television listings for 
times. 

Refreshments such as cheese, cracken 
and fruit are provided and visitors may 
park in lots 1, 2 or 3 near Ihe Gates Sports 
Cenier 

"Any person who wants lo learn more 
about what writers do - that's who should 
come," adds Cam 



said student Sara Colbert 
a criminal^ justice major 

The change came as a suipri.se to listen- 
ers. On Saturday night. Sept. 21, the BI06 
staff simply stated that lightning had struck 
the building In aciualiiy, die staUon had 
signed off Three days of endless nature 
sounds from a Dan Gibson collection, 
"Thunderstorm in die Wilderness, " followed. 

Several people called the station in their 



radio stations do nol 
seem to worry. 

"[ don'l expect Ihem taking anyone from 
us," said Doc West, program director for 
Rock 104 "We have a much heavier sound." 

"Honestly, diere now seems to be ^ niche 
missing in the station (Storm)," said Taylor. 

The station had gotten rid of the old and 
brought on Ihe new, No longer will there be

confusion. Many listeners complained. Some Friday and Saturday nights in Fort Wayne, 

others called lo offer their appreciation of the Yet, listeners might enjoy die tunes they hear,

bul whoever can hasn't shown 
up in over two weeks as the 
IPFW women's volleyball leam 
ran its win streak lo nine 
straight wiih wins over die 
University of Wisconsin- 
Parkside and Grand Valley 
Sute University. 

Anoiher m a string of three- 
straight blowoub, the UWP 
match was just more of 
Heffron's "lakin' care of busi- 
ness " The Rangers walked inio 
the Gales Cenier only to be 
ambushed, 15-6, 15-7, 15-10. 

Despite the one-sided score 
and IPFW's athletic dominance, 
UWP was another pesky leam 
the Volleydons have had to pui 
away ibis season, as die match 
time of over 90 minutes shows 

"1 think we played pretty 



well, actually" Heffron said. 
"We had to earn everydiing we 
goL They came ready to play." 

IPFW used its impressive 
middle attack and continued lo 
work on its serving and passing 
in preparation for Tuesday's 
journey to GVSU, 

"We unproved on Ihe things 
we tried to improve on," 
Heffron said, "It was probably 
our best offensive performance 
of the season, as far as siaiisUcs 
are concerned , We could have 
served a litde better" 

Nearly a week off before 
Friday's alumni match proved 
no detriment to the 'Dons as the 
team showed good passing and 
leadership from die right per- 
sonnel Saturday afternoon. As 
the season wears on. Heffron 



will rely more and more on his 
junior and semor class, includ- 
ing Andy Reichan, who 
anchored the middle again 
Saturday; Amy Luben, 
Heffron's mainstay at seller; 
and Julie Parrot. 

"Amy played real well 
today." Heffron said, "She's 
really started to perform like 
an upperclassman, making 
someihmg out of noihmg situ- 
ations, making good choices. 
And Julie played pretty well," 

Tuesday nighi capped what 
could be die team's definrng 
moment of Ihe season: a sec- 
ond three-game victory over 
Grand Valley Suic University.

^Lhe religion of noi^-religion 



by Paul 1\ippcr 
Editor 

I want (o begin discussing (he 
(liversiiy among religions, bui T 
iJon't feel qualiried Yoo see. I don't 
have a religious an~ilia(ion I round 
out about three years ago thai I was 
bapiizfd Catholic when I was six, 
but I have never followed or stud- 
ied the religion since. So who am I 
to discuss reUgion? 

Bui as someone who has no faith 
in a religion. I can speak about the 
road I've traveled to live comfon- 
ably as a non-religious person 
Especially in a culture dominated 
by religion. 

It would be easy to say that my 
parents are to blame for me not 
going to chuicb or studying the 
Bible In fact, Sundays were always 
a day of rest in my household. 
Occasionally we'd vLsil my grand- 
parents or go for a drive, but for the 
most pan, we stayed at home doing 
home-type things. 

But even if I had gone to church 
regularly. I think I would still 
choose not to embrace a religion as 
an adulL I personally fuid many of 
the teachings to be contradictory 
Case in pomL Religious wars 1 find 
il bard to believe God ordered 
another person, or a group of per- 



sons, to kill anyone because Uiey 
had a different religion Isn't one of 
the Ten Commandments 'Thou 
shall not kill?" 

To be frank. I question if there is 
a God at all. If you think about it. 
this person must have been extraor- 
dinary to acc(xnplish some of the 
things he supposedly has dcHie. It's 
really unbelievable. Here we have a 
man who killed his own son Ask 
Susan Smith what the ramifications 
are for doing that today. 

And I question the validity of the 
Bible llunk about it, if this book 
were written today, do you think it 
would have made the impact il has? 
I mean, who really wrote the Bible? 
I see the Bible a5 a good book, with 
good stories Not a guide for my 
life, I wouldn't even trust Douglas 
Coupland, my favorite writer, with 
my life. Why should I tnist the 
author of this book? And with any 
good story, it means something dif- 
ferent for someone else Perhaps 
that's why we now have these dif- 
ferent venions thai conpadict each 
other Which version should wc 
tielieve? Original version? New 
version? King James? And why 
should we follow a book that 
denounces cenain people for the 
uncontrollable way they are bom 
and stifles the role of women ' 



It is for these reasons I have 
grown comfortable widi a life ihat 
does not include religion It is bet- 
ter for me to worship the people 
around be. not someone 1 cannot 
see or talk to 1 put my faith in my 
mentors and my .friends and my 
family and myself People who

There is definite doubt about the 
value of reLgions among today's 
people. Yet wc still let those m the

our morals. Can't we just respect 
these di^ercnt beliefs and move 
on? 

I am now going to turn this topic 
over to you. I'm looking for people 
involved with this campus in any 
way to comment on other rehgions 
I want to know what Ufe is like as a 
Jew or a Buddhist Perhaps you 
practice witchcraft and you consid- 
er it a reLgion Tell us about it 
What makes your religion differ- 
ent? Have you ever been discnmi- 
nated against because of it? What 
should we know about your reli- 
gion that we might not know if you 
hadn't spoken up? What's a mis- 
conception about people of your 
faith? Enlighten us 



A Gay Perspective 



by Paul TXipper 

Gays and religion don't seem to 
mix, but they do. An increasing 
amount of gays are attending 
church and an increasing amount of 
churches are accepting, even invit- 
ing, gays 10 become pan of the con- 
gregation. It IS imponant to remem- 
ber that ndi all people who follow a 



particular faith feel negatively 
about gays. It's those individuals 
who make attending church a reali- 
ty for some gays and lesbians. 

I think it will be interesting to 
see what evolves from gays being 
allowed to marry. Once that hap- 
pens, and it will happen, more gays 
will feel more comfonablc attend- 
ing the church Ihji m;imi.'d ihcm 



and become a member of its con- 
gregation. 

Know that not every gay or les- 
bian is non-rcUgious. Because of 
negative religious teachings about 
gay people, gays stnjggle with their 
sexuality And I thmk the further 
we come to accepting homosexual- 
iiy. the more gay; will be wel- 
Liimcd in m(i\i ihuicht.''. 



Bands aid 
The Loft 

by Richard CuclUr 
Staff Writer 

As a community we some- 
tmies do not appreciate local 
anists and their work Perhaps 
it is because the "stages" we are 
acquainted with don't always 
show us the full spectrum of this 
city's cultural rainbow Some 
may think art is only for the rich 
and famous However, the peo- 
ple who bring us an are often 
wealthy in areas other than 
money Some of tbem have an 
immeasurable wealth of ideas 
and spirit. Julie Bryer Ls such a 
person. 

Bryer. a big admirer of blues 
music, decided to coordinate a 
benefit concert in honor of the 
blues It was her first lime orga- 
nizing this type of event, and 
she was surprised al the number 
of local institutions wilhng to 
donate funds The search for a 
benefactor and venue to host the 
function followed. When she 
beard about The Loft, her jour- 
ney arrived at its destination. 

The Loft is dedicated not 
only to bringing people together 
with a variety of artistic ideas, 
but also setting a stage for any- 
one to wimess this faM^inaiing 
diversity. The Loft depends 
heavily on grants, donations and 
a crew of volunteers for its sur- 
vival. 

The benefit that Bryer helped 
to organize. The "Blues Bash," 
stans at 7 p.m on October 5. A 
portion of the SIO admi.ssion 
will be donated to The Loft.

'The First Wives Club' 



by Jtnmy Eccnbargcr 
Chief Rtporler 

From its colorful caHoon begin- 
ning lo its musical ending, il is a 
move thai is sure lo make anyone 
laugh. "The First Wives Club" 
bnngs Bctic Midler's sassy voice, 
Goldic Hawn's cute humor and 
Diane Kcalon's choppy remarks and 
rolls [hem into one gul-busiing 
show. 

The story centers around three 
women who have been left by their 
husbands for new, beautiful, "lecn" 
ladies. Through their anger, the 
women decide lo plot revenge on 
[heir ex-husbands and take every- 
ihing [hat means anything lo [hem. 

The theme and essence behind 
[he film may vaguely resemble the 
80s hii ■•9 (o 5. " As with "The First 
Wives Club." the Tilm teamed up 
three popular celebrities who por- 
nayed employees working together 
to get back at their boss. 

The story opens as Ihe ladies' 
long-ume (nend. played by 
S[ockard Cbanning (Too Wong Foo, 
Thanks for F.verything! Julie 
Newmar), kills herself by jumping 
out her balcony window Before 
doing so, she sends a letter to her 
[hree long-time college friends to 
tell [hem to take care of each other 
and do not let the same thing happen 
to them She was upset because her 
husband ran away with a younger 
woman, 

Kcalon's characlCT. Annie, nar- 
rates the story She is the woman 
who seems lo learn the most from 
the whole expenence, Annie is a 
character who has no outspoken 
attributes. She is con.standy apolo- 
gizing for everything, even for her 
husband's adulterous ways. In a 
chance to save her marriage, Annie 
and her husband see the same [My- 
chiatrisl. played by Marcia Gay 
Harden (The SpilTire Gnll) Yeu to 
her dismay, Annie discovers that the 



psychiatnst is not jusi her shrink but 
also her husband's lover Surprise! 

Midler plays Brenda, a dominant 
mother who is concerned dial she 
will have to gci a job at McDonalds 
10 suppori her son. When her hus- 
band leaves her for a much younger 
and slimmer woman, played by 
Sarah Jessica Parker, she endlessly 
worrits about ihe welfare of her 
son. Brenda is the kind of woman 
who has lost all faith that any man 
would ever want her again 
However, she is definitely not a 
woman afraid of saying what is on 
her mind. 

Finally, there's Hawn's charac- 
ter. Elise, who is the mosi melodra- 
matic character of them all She is 
an accomplished actress with 
Golden Globe and Academy Awards 
to prove i[. Elise becomes a com- 
plete drunk over [he tad that she is 
definitely geiting older She is con- 
stantly having plasuc surgery in 
order to maintain her "young and 
beautiful" image In fact, in the 
beginnmg of the film, she decides to 
get her lips enlarged - the Mick 
Jagger look. Her husband, a produc- 
er, decides to leave her anyway for a 
younger actress, played by 
ELzabclh Berkley (Showgirls), and 
[hen hopes lo receive alimony from 
Hawn's weallhy character. 

As the women ftrsi reunite at 
their friend's funeral, they try to 
imagine ihal nothmg has changed 
between them over the last few 
years. They could not have been 
more wrong. Yet. when they go to 
lunch after the ceremony, [faey dis- 
cover they do have much m com- 
mon. They have all been left by 
their husbands for younger women. 

Sooner of later, the women, after 
reading the letter from their friend. 
decide to gel revenge against (heir 
deceiving husbands. With the help 
of Anme's demanding mother and 
her lesbian daughter, Qrenda's inte- 
rior designer fnend and Elise's 



money, they begin to take control of 
Uieir siiuaiioas They form the very 
firsi "Firsi Wives Club " 

With their sly, conniving ways 
and their matured intellect. Uiey 
produce some hilanous momenLs 
and eventually the ultimate revenge. 
Not only do they destroy their hus- 
bands' lives, they also set them- 
selves up for a promising future. 

The film is full of terrific 
moments for each actress. Moments 
such as the time when they each 
slap each other in their frustrations. 
or when they escape Brenda's hus- 
band's apartment with important 
business papers, or finally their 
memorable musical collaboration at 
the end. show that these women 
really know how to please an audi- 
ence. 

With a clever script, terrific lead- 
ing actresses, and a memorable sup- 
porting cast, this film is not to be 
missed. Be prepared to be intrigued; 
gel ready lo learn some more Bobbit 
techniques and. most importantly. 
be ready lo laugh your ass off.

'Eleemosynary' 



by Rebecca Koenig 
Starr Writer 

A young giri wins the National 
Spelling Bee Competition by 
spelling, defining and explaining 
seldom used words such as 
"eleemosynary." A middle-aged 
woman, devoted to biochemistry, is 
able to remember everything to 
which she is exposed. An older 
women explores Ihe supernatural. 
she loves UFO's, life after death. 
and the concept of people flying 
unaided by machinery. Putting these 
three women together produces one 
thing. Eleemosynary. 

Eleemosynary, Lee Blessing's 
popular off-Broadway play, was 
presented on campus by the 
Department of Theater and the 
Purdue -Indiana Theater. It was per- 
formed in the Studio Theater, 
Kctller Hall, on September 26. 27 
and 28. 

The play invited the audience to 
watch three generations of women 
work out their differences and grow 
as individuals. Each character letls a 
secuon of the stcny and the audience 
puts all of the mformation together 
for a final story Dorothea 
Wesibrook (played by Kendra 
Clauser) attempts lo teach her 
daughter, Artie Westbrook (Jane 
Rebekah Frazier) to fly A few years 
later, Dorothea encourages her 
young, pregnant daughter to abort 
her baby She knows her husband 
will demand the girl get married, 
Dorothea married young and was 
never happy in her marriage. She 
wants Artie lo have more in her life 
than an unhappy marriage. 

After the abortion, Anie leaves 
home. She hides from her mother 
for several ye^^ Artie fmds a job as 
a teacher and eventually puis herself 



through graduate school She finds a 
job in research and marries a co- 
worker Artie calls Dorothea with 
the news, she is once again preg- 
nant. 

Shortly after the baby (played by 
Clarissa DuBois) was bom. Artie's 
husband dies Artie was distraught 
over the death of her husband 
Unlike Artie. Dorothea rtacied 
rather indifferently when her hus- 
band died Artie, on the other hand. 
was crushed She did not speak to 
anyone for a number of days. 

The baby was named Barbra. but 
she is referred to as Echo. She is die 
image of her mother. The older 
women compete for Echo's love, 
Artie eventually leaves Echo with 
Dorothea and moves away to work 
When Artie moves back near her 
family, she nouces that Echo has 
become very close lo her grand- 
mother, overcoming feelings of 
abandonment from her mother 

Echo's calling in life is spelLng. 
Artie helps her practice for [he 
spelling bee over the [elcphonc 
Echo insists both her mother and 
grandmother attend the national 
championship Shortly after, 
Dorothea has a stroke and becomes 
catatonic Echo visits her every day 

After Dorothea dies, Artie asks 
her brother to allow Echo lo live 
with his family Echo runs away 
frcHn him and returns to her mother. 
Echo explains she wants to make 
her mother love her She acts as 
though love IS conditional and if she 
can just be good enough, her moth- 
er will love her 

The play is about the interaction 
between women, with only a few 
references made to men. Each 
expresses love m a different way. 
Whether because they are alike or 
different, mother-daughter relation- 



ships are often stressed. This play 
shows thai even though mothers 
want the bcsi for their little girls, the 
children must be allowed to develop 
into the person they are and have 
their own life. Mothers and daugh- 
ters can have a successful relation- 
ship, if [hey jusi work at il. 

Overall, [he play was very effec- 
tive. The sei fit perfectly with the 
play. The props also worked well. 
However, the best pan of the play 
was the acting, 

Clauser. Frazier and DuBois all 
gave wonderful performances. The 
costume used for Clauser's charac- 
ter, E&gt;orothea. appeared to have been 
very carefully chosen. Clauser fit 
the role well and remained in per- 
fect character throughout the play. 

Frazier seemed perfectly fit for 
[he characier of Artie, Envisioning 
her as anything hut the exceptional- 
ly bright and cynical character she 
portrayed is impossible. Her quiet 
disposition contrasted the outspo- 
kenness of the others. 

DuBois was also well chosen for 
her pan Although it was odd to see 
a fully grown woman acting like an 
infant, DuBois did so energetically. 
The best moments of the play for 
her were during the spelling bee. 
She had to act innocent when facing 
the judges, yet let the audience see 
her competitive side at the same 
time. 

Anyone who missed 

"Eleemosynary' missed a very 
well-produced play. Upcoming 
plays include "West Side Slory " and 
Alan Bowne's "BeiruL" "West Side 
Story " will be performed in cooper- 
ation with the Fort Wayne 
Philharmonic in the Embassy 
Theatre on Nov. 7, 8 and 9. "Beirut" 
will be performed on Nov, 21, 22 
and 23 in the Studio Theatre.

"POSTAL '■ The 
child was sus- 
pended for 
improper touch-

when most chil- 

dren do not even think in terms of 
improper touching or sexual 
harassment 

The school distnct spokesperson 
defended the school's decisitHi by 
saying a "6-year-old kissing anoth- 
er 6-year-old is inappropriate 
behavior," 

According to the boy, the girl 
asked to be kissed. Whether that 
was tbe case or not. the school 
overreacted The situation should 
have been dealt with on a smaller 
scale. If the kiss was unwanted, talk 
to the boy If the kiss was desired, 
let 6-year-olds be 6-year-olds. 

Children for years have played

courts found the security officer's 
search unreasonable, they sent the

agree with die right of die individ-

children lo learn in a safe environ-

In die case of the 6-year-old, the 
school sent a message thai affection

Letters to the Editor 



Columnist faces dissent, criticism 



To the editor. 

TTiis letter is in response to S 
Brant Kelley's column (Courts [sic) 
only symbol of larger problem, 
September 19, 1996V 

Mr. Kelley begms with the sup- 
posiuon that judges "from the 
Supreme Court on down, have led 
diis nation inio a moral free fall." He 
then winds bis way through a 
painful argument in which logic is 
tossed aside, unproven assumptions 
ascend to the level of fact, and, iron- 
ically, facts are either absent, irrele- 
vant, or, as is often the case, inaccu- 
rate. 

Finally, then, he arrives at a con- 
clusion which IS somewhat unrelat- 
ed to the content of a majoniy of his 
argument and certamly not a direct 
descendant of his original supposi- 
tion. 

What's more, he concludes this 
confused series of pubhc rumbhngs 
with an analogy dial is more cosdy 
to his argument than tteneficial 

My immediate reaction to his col- 
umn was apathy. There will always 
be diose who simply can't get it, 1 
thought. But then, upon closer 
examination of the issues involved, I 
decided that someone must speak 
up; someone must take a stand 
against diis attack on logic and his- 
tory To be sure. Mr Kelley's 
remarks ought to be challenged 
because they are wrong, however, 1 
would contend that there is even a 
larger issue at stake than tbe imme- 
diate one presented here tixlay 

In fact, Mr Kelley's views are 
reprcscntauve of a larger movement 
in America — a movement whose 
structure is undemocratic, whose 
intentions are anu-demooadc, and 
whose impact on Amenca's democ- 



ratic system ranges from significant 
to profound. 

The movement I am referring to 
is, of course, the Religious Right. 

Let's begin with Mr Kelley's first 
inaccurate fH-emise, "that our educa- 
tional systems and our public policy 
reflect godlessness and a lack of 
eidier true value or efTectiveness..." 
As a mauer of logic, this statement 
fails on three counts. 

Fust, Mr Kelley's use of the 
word "godlessness" is unfair in the 
context of the argument. Federal, 
state and local governments in the 
United States are prohibited by the 
Constitution from establi.shjng or. by 
extension of logic, favoring a partic- 
ular reUgion. Thus, agencies of any 
one of those bodies, such as public 
schools, are bound by die same con- 
stitutional guide hues. 

As Mr Kelley should know, this 
does not mean students must leave 
Uieir god(s) at die school house gate; 
radier, it has come lo mean that no 
school official may impose his or 
her chosen god(s) on any student 
while Ihdi smdent is confined widun 
dial school house gate. Second, it is 
false to assume that, because a state 
operates within the confmes of the 
US Constitution and does not 
establish an official religion m its 
public schools, it is dien absent of 
"true values." And, finally, it also 
does not follow that such constitu- 
donal behavior by a state i 
ly leads to "ineffecL 
either its public policy or its educa- 
uve mission 

Next, Mr, Kelley asserts that 
"these same individuals" have 
replaced natural law theory widi 
"values education." and that diis 
somehow leads to a more complicat- 



ed tax structure and presumably a 
failing NCAA, 

The reader is left to decide for 
him- or herself exacdy how one 
necessitates tbe other, and Mr 
Kelley remains peculiarly silent 
about the relationship. Neither does 
he explain how judges have impact- 
ed the principle of "values educa- 
tion" in die classroom. For dial mat- 
ter, he doesn't even bodier to share 
with us a definition of "values edu- 
cation." One can only assume it 
must be pretty bad, diough. if it has 
had such a considerably negative 
effect on the lax code and the 
NCAA 

Mr Kelley then utUizcs three 
paragraphs to compare today's 
judges to known sinners of Jesus' 
day. Through this comparison be 
apparendy hopes to demonstrate 
diat our nauon's judges ought to be 
followuig Mosaic laws more closely 
when making judicial determina- 
tions Putting aside for a moment 
the obvious fault m this reasoning. I 
would like to remind Mr Kelley that 
an analogy proves nothing This, 
of course, is especially true when 
the analogy's very content is at 
issue. More impottandy. though, 
Mr. Kelley's argument falters here 
because be ignores once again the 
principle of religious freedom as set 
out in the First Amendment 

On diis point 1 would respectful- 
ly ask Mr Kelley to reconsider his 
position Do we ready want our 
nation's judges basing dieu legal 
decisions on dicir singular interpre- 
tations of religious doctrines? If 
Mr. Kelley continues to answer in 
the affirmative, then I would remind 
him that not all judges arc Christian 
Should judges of other faiths also 



look to their respective bibles for 
answers to legal quesUons' 

Or is it Mr, Kelley's contenuon 
diat the United States should apply a 
CbrisUan-only standard when 
choosing its judges? 

Finally, Mr. Kelley arrives at the 
dirust of his position, stating bis 
suppon for the notion dial 
Amencans must read the Bible to 
remain free. He then explains that 
religious faidis oUier Uian 
Christianity, or even inierpretadons 
of Chrisdanity contrary to his own, 
are incomplete and therefore likely 
to lead to an absence of freedom. As 
odd as diis argument seems, it is 
commonly heard among those from 
whom Mr. Kelley is receiving his 
ideas. Mr Kelley closes with an 
analogy in which the United Slates 
is compared to a tree which with- 
stood outside attack but rotted from 
within The analogy would be bet- 
ter served if not for die fact dial Mr, 
Kelley's proposals for a theocracy 
are themselves caustic to our 
Amencan way of life. 

In conclusion, 1 agree widi Mr. 
Kelley's assertion diat our nation 
must begin to face tough moral 
questions and increase public 
accountability among its leaders; 
however. I am afraid that the solu- 
tions offered by him and others in 
his movement represent serious dan- 
gers to our nadon's long-standing 
traditions of freedom of religion and 
equality under the law I am con- 
vinced that we can find soludons to 
our common problems whde simul- 
taneously maintaining the miegrity 
of our beloved Consuiudon,

Diversity includes Christianity 



To die Hditor. 

The anicle in the latest issue of The 
Communicator entided "Journey to Diversity — 
Let's Work Together" left me feeling uncomfon- 
able. 1 spent some tune laying awake last night 
trying to focus my thoughts 1 arrived at some 
conclusions about which I'd like to be open. 

The article implied that many of the readers 
may noi really grasp the true meaning of diversi- 
ty, Paul Tupper. Tbe Communicator's editor, and 
the ardcle's author, went on to reveal a piece of 
his definiiion a.s encompassing those with " 
different cdiniciiy or religion in a white man's 
country , , ." 

He then personified some categories of diver- 
sity, including " person with a disabihty 
being a woman bemg Asian , , gays and les- 
bians, . ." Mr, Tupper's definition, revealed 
through many examples, seems to be more of a 
broad definidon of minority than diversity. 

At one point be says, "It is my goal to explore 
the different life experiences dial can occur only 
when you are a 'minority.'" At least this is the 



I thread within defining examples in peo- 
ple groups expenenang a degree of persecuurm 
(As a side-note, wouldn't followers of Chnsi be 
members of die author's defmed group, if you 
consider their undue persecution Uiroughoui his- 
tory, as far back as Christ hunself? However, diey 
are not supported by inclusion in Mr, Tupper's 
arUcle.) 

Mirriam- Webster's definition of diversity. 
albeit from an outdated (1986) publicadon date. 
IS 'die condition of being different" Personally. I 
am comfortable with that broader defmition In 
fact, aren't we all different? 

Aren't we all marvelous, wonderful and 
unique displays of the miracle of creation? To go 
funher. and to pick up Mr Tupper's Uieme. don't 
all of us humans expencncc some level of perse- 
cuuon (trial and tribulaUon) m this life? 

So as not to be contused with Webster's defm- 
mon of diversity, a more titung tide for die series 
might be something along the hnes of "Journey 
to Apprcciadng Persecuted People Groups." It 
would seem to tetter convey die true modve, pur- 
pose and goal in whung the articles. 



At diis point. I want lo extend a hand to Paul 
Tupper, Personally, although my beliefs preclude 
my agreement widi his belief system specifically 
related to sexual onentadon. and although I can- 
not truly idenufy widi his personal persecuuons, 
I can sull love him. and odiers like him, as a 
human being. 

In understanding and embraang pure diversi- 
ty, it is not necessary to agree with or accept die 
belief systems of selected particular groups, or 
pretend to identify widi dieir experiences, but 
msiead to accept and mdeed, upldi all humanity 
as beautiful and diverse reflections of the Creator, 

As I continue to read Paul's series, I wait with 
hope that 1 might see m his writing a connection 
between us as individuals stnving for a true cir- 
cle of acceptance of people from every walk of 
hfe, including those with whom we struggle and 
differ, 

I can embrace diat Journey. (Now, maybe I'll 
gel some sleep , )

Cross country runners climb 
hilly course at Earlham College 



by S. Brant Kelley 
Sports Editor 

The IPFW aoss country teams 
continued their run through the fall 
season last weekend at the Earlham 
TnvJtaiion^ Cross Country meet, by 
far the largest gathcnng the barriers 
have panicipaied in this season. 

On iheir most hilly course so far, 
Mastodon runners continued lo 
improve their limes. 

The men's team placed tenth out 
of fourteen teams, just behind Great 
Lakes Valley Conference member 
Northern Kentucky University, 
which finished ninth. Anderson 
University leveled the competition 
with 19 poinis. Second-place 
Huniinglon College scored 107. 

Steve Teusch led the IPFW run- 
ners at 28th place with an eight-kilo- 
meler time of 28 minutes and 15 
seconds. Adam Banon followed al 
33rd with a 28:21 lime. Chad 



Clevinger finished 51st with a time 
of 29:10 in what proved to be a tight 
race. David Foote, who finished 
I Mth last year at the same race, fin- 
ished a gutsy 90ih just hours after 
enduring a low blood sugar anack. 

The women's team fared a liiUe 
belter, finishing eighth out of 15 
teams al the event. Kay Pulver 
paced the Mastodons by placing 
sixth with a five -kilometer course 
time of 20 minutes and 22 seconds. 
Melanie Vamer followed ju.st two 
places and 12 seconds behind for an 
eighth-place fmish. 

The women's team waited more 
dian 50 places before seeing the 
thud runner enter the gale: Madeline 
Roser (59lh) entered with a time of 
22 minutes and seven seconds, 
Mona Marandl (93rd) followed at 
23:03 and Cindy Duba ( 1 23rd) came 
in at 24:29 in another crowded field. 

Anderson also won the women's 
race with 63 poinLs, while Alma 



College, Taylor University and 
Hanover College finished two. three 
and four with 93. 94 and 95 points, 
respectively. 

Both the men's and women's 
teams travel to Goshen College this 
weekend to run in the Goshen 
Inviiaiional.

Volleyball, from page 1 

"As well a.s we played last time, 
we played even better," Hcffron 
said of the 15-8. 15-8. 15-8 victory 
in Allendale. "They played better, 
loo, but this time, we were domi- 
naling in every phase of the game." 

Dominant they were. The 
VoUeydons spread their prowess 
beyond the middle this match, serv- 
ing only three service errors, cwn- 
d to 20 against UWP, and five 
aces. 

We served much better ihis 
time," Heffron said. "Bui the story 
the bitting." 

Ji yes, the hilling. The 
VoUeydons registered a ,462 kill 
percentage while putting down 52 
balls with only eight errors. 
Sophomore DotUe Porch led the 
way with 11 kills and a .667 per- 
centage which speaks volumes 
when 40 percent is good. 

The match went a long way in 
securing IPFW's tounicy hopes; the 
VoUeydons are ranked fiflh in the 
region, GVSU sixth and GLVC 
rival Northern Kentucky third. 
NKU is now their biggest obstacle 

J tournament bid. They lost lo the 

ond- and fourth-ranked teams in 
the region, both within the first 
seven matches, and won't play the 
top team, Northeni Michigan. 
We just have to slay very 
sisient and continue lo improve llo 
keep our hopes alive]," Heffron 
said.

Soccer team gains ground; surprises conference power 




b&gt; S, Brant Kelley 
Sports Editor 



Tlic men's soccer team continues to bowl 
opponents out of the way like pins in a bowling 
alley. With a renewed vigor and confidence 
spawned by the spirited and narrow loss to 
Maiquelle University two weeks ago. the 
Mastodons have risen to the top of ihc Great 
l.iikes Valley Conference. 

WiLh lie exception of a narrow and qucsiion- 
,ihlc gutter at Quincy twelve days ago. IPFW has 
won three games against conference contenders, 
one of them a former Division I squad, en route 
to ihc top of the league, ouLscoring its opponents 
10-3 in the process. 

Ihc onslaught continued last 
Sjrurday as the Mastodons drubbed 
ihi- I'niversily qi Indianapolis, 4-1 
Ihc Mastodons scored the first three 
L'lKiJ-. in the (ini half, two by Paul 
ll.irvcy and the other by Justin 
I jhrum, and cr\iised to the win at 
II'I^V 

i he Mastodons used a dcfcnse- 
M-intd counterattack lo defeat UI's 
^iruni; midfield "We let them win 
nuijrield, came back on defense, and 
muniLTdttacked," IPFW coach Teny 
Si(;Iankiewicz said. 

.M.inny PsKi scored in the second 
h.ili tu even Indianapolis' only goal of 



good team." 

IPFW conducted much of its offense on the 
touch lines as they built another 3-0 halftimc 
lead 

"We wanted to take the ball down the wing." 
Siefankiewic/ said, "We got some nice combina- 
tion play (among the forwards] " 

Captain Mike Harper, who played a supporting 
role the previous afternoon with two assisLs, sin- 
gle-handedly ripped the heart out of the St. Joe 
defense with four goals 

Despite Sunday's monster performance, this 
Mastodon team contains an offensive balance 
sorely lacking on last season's squad. While 
Harper is on pace to match last season's perfor- 
mance of 20 goals, the rest of the team looks to 
coninbuie more than the five goals the next high- 



cil scoRT netted last year 

"As a matter of fact, we're using Harper as a 
decoy now." Sicfankicwicz said. "We're starting 
10 use a Labnim and a Perez now." 

On the other end of the pilch, the young 
defense, once a prune concern for Siefankiewic?.. 
has matured dramatically Keeping the foe out of 
the penally area, the defending side made up for 
the offense's one-goal tum-in during last 
Sunday's 1-0 win over the University of 
Missouri-St. Louis. This weekend showed more 
of the same as the defense allowed only three 
goals, 

"The defense has really solidified," 
Stefankiewicz said. "Our decision-making on 
defense has been much belter" 



Sunday afternoon brought more of 
,' \ame as the Mastodons pounded

"It was a really good win," 

The soccer team shows why they are the team to beat. Stefankiewicz said, "and now the guys
