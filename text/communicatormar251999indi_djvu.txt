eieclion are tallied. 



Current IPSGA President Joe 
Schroeder was elected for a sec- 
ond term during Monday and 
Tuesdaj's student government 
elections. 

"I'm looking fonvard to con- 
tinuing to sene as a go-between 
for the students and the adminis- 
tration," Schroeder said. 

Schroeder also wants to 
de\elop programs thai better 
■■ene the students. 

"1 would like to see programs 
started that would sa\'e students 
money," Schroeder said, "I would 
also like to fill all committee 
vacancies with students." 

All other student govern- 
ment positions ran unopposed, 
and [hose elected included Jim 
Corson, vice president; Jence 
Johnson, \ice president of pro- 
gramming; Rand&gt;' Spicer. vice 
president of finance; and sena-

Roebel. 

Corson is hop- 
ing that the student

er even more effec- 
tively next semester. 

"I'd like there 
to be a greater sense 
of uniti' bet^veen the 
people up here," 
Corson said. 

"Communication is 
essential when j ou 
are in a position like 
this. The student 
government has to 
be a team." 

Despite the res- 
ignation of former 
IPSGA president 
Chuck Newman last fall, the orga- 
nization was able to continue 
productively. 

"We've spent the jear learn- 
ing and now we all ha\c a prettj

Work opportunities available through Job Fair 



by Rachel Landrum, 
Staff Writer 



On Thursday, March 18. IPFW Student 
Employment Ser\'ices, a division of Career 
Services, sponsored the nineteenth Annual 
Summer Job Fair. 

The fair had over 200 students attend 
to discuss employment needs with approxi- 
mately 45 businesses. 

"If a student is looking for a job, thej' 
can find it here," said Mary Ball Brant, coor- 
dinator of Student Emp!o&gt;Tnent Services. 

Brant said that the fair is not just for 
employers looking for summer help. 

Professional businesses attend to awak- 
en students to the many jobs available now 



in the path of their future careers. 

The abundance of employment avail- 
able is so great that some businesses could 
not attend due to a lack of help in their 
offices. 

One busmess present at the fair was 
United Postal Service. 

"There are positions available to meet a 
variet&gt;' of schedules," said Jessica Ulman of 
the human resources department for UPS. 

Also attending the fair were representa- 
tives for The Citj' of Fort Waj'ne, a major 
employer of students, 

"Students come to us to get an idea of 
what we ha\'e a\'ailable. Some stay with us 
for years, some leave sooner if it is not what 
they are looking for. But we do have posi- 
tions for those looking for more than one 
summer job," said Patty Davis, of the Parks 



Department. 

Maria Brenneke, assistant to the coordi- 
nator of Student Employment Services, had 
a suggestion for students who could not 
attend the fair. 

"Come in anj' time to the office and 
look at employment books and get informa- 
tion about jobs and employers," said 
Brenneke. 

Information is available about the 
employers that participated in the 
Employment Fair as well as other potential 
employers, Brenneke said. 

Information directlj' concerning 
employers at the fair can be gathered bj 
contacting the business or b&gt; coming into 
the Career Services Office located in Walb 
113 or calling 481-6596. 



IPFW loses long-time 
employee and friend 



by Brian Miller, 
Sports Edilor 



Health program obtains high ratings 



by Ben Ruble. 
Slafi Writer 



IPFW's Health Information Technology 
(HIT) program was recently ranked 24th 
among the 171 programs nationwide. 

The HIT program is a two-year associate 
degree program for a full-time student. 

A few of the jobs HIT students can have 
are health information specialists, consul- 
tants and staff for a variet&gt;' of businesses, 
said Barbara Ellison, HIT program director. 

According to the HIT brochure, "Health 
information technicians maintain medical, 
scientific and legal documents regarding a 
patient's injurj' or illness." 

The brochure also states many of the 
health information technicians work in the 



health information services of a hospital, 
ambulator)' care or another health care 
facility. 

Graduates of the program are eligible 
to take the National Accreditation 
Examination of the American Health 
Information Management Association 
(AHIMA). 

The exam allows graduates to become 
an accredited record technician (ART). This 
exam is given by AHIMA once a year. 

"The examination consists of 150 multi- 
ple choice questions, with topics such as 
pharmacolog\ , anatomj and physiology, 
1CD-9-CM coding, nomenclatures, health 
record law, health records, qualit&gt;' manage- 
ment, utilization management, personnel, 
data presentation, computerization princi- 
ples, etc,' said Ellison. 



Once graduates earn the ART creden- 
tials, thej' must follow through with 20 
hours of continuing education oxer the 
course of a two-year c&gt;cle. They must fol- 
low this throughout their career in order to 
maintain the ART credentials, according to 
the HIT brochure. 

Ellison also said that the HIT program 
was started in 1992, and everj' jear the pro- 
gram's mean score has been above the 
national mean score. 

Ellison is hopeful that the high ranking 
will generate more interest in the program, 

HIT is setting up a homepage, that 
should be available bj- the end of the acade- 
mic year. 

For more information, contact the HIT 
program office at 481-6055. 



Nursing honor society recognizes achievement 



byJodlSchierling, 
StafI Wrrter 



Key faculty in the IPFW 
Nursing Program began the 
process of establishing an IPFW 
Nuning Honor Society over one 
year ago as a prerequisite to 
applying for a chapter charter 
with the Sigma Iheta Tau 
International Honor Society of 
Nursing. 

Sarah Beckman, president 
of the IPFW Nursing Honor 
Society, and Opal Freiburger, 
associate professor of nursing 
and vice president and program 
chair of the IPFW Nursing 
Societ&gt;', worked to form the hon- 
on societj' in order to recognize 
scholarly achievement of nurs- 
ing students in the IPFW 
programs. 

In order to become a part of 
the greater communit)' of nurs- 
ing professionals, the IPFW hon- 
ors societ)' is now in the process 
of establishing a sound member- 
ship and financial base in order 
to meet Sigma Theta Tau Honor 
Societ&gt;' criteria. 

"It is our goal to pool 
human and financial resources 
with the chapter already estab- 
lished at the University of Saint 
Francis," said Beckman. "We 
plan to apply for a charter at- 
iarge for the greater Fort Wa&gt;'ne 
area," 

The newly formed IPFW 
Nursing Honor Society is work- 
ing to become a part of one of 
the largest and most prestigious 
nursing organizations in the 



world. 

Sigma Theta Tau 

International, founded in 1922 
by six nursing students at 
Indiana University, has over 350 
chapters and 230,000 members 
today who live and work in over 
73 countries. 

The IPFW Honors Society 
recognized 89 individuals dur- 
ing its first induction ceremonj- 
on Dec. 6. 1998. 

Seven current baccalaureate 
nursing students, Pamela 
DeKoninck, Judith Leonard, Joy 
Martin, Jane McCleltan, Susan 
Meinte!, and Jessie Richardson; 
and seven graduate students in 
nursing, Terry Ahr, Nancy 
Fieldhousc. Valerie Kipfer, 
Sharon Powell, Debra Close, Rita 
Deininger, and Rebecca Jensen, 
became honored members of 
this society. 

"It's nice to be recognized 
for working hard," said Susan 
Meintel, senior and archivist for 
the board of directors of the 
IPFW Nursing Honors Society. 
"This is a good opportunity to 
be a part of the greater nursing 
communit&gt;'." 

The International Honors 
organization of Sigma Theta Tau 
strives to promote excellence, 
scholarship, and leadership in 
the nursing profession. 

Members in the honors 
society have demonstrated supe 
rior achievement in undergrad- 
uate or graduate nursing stud- 
ies, or leadership in the nursing 
profession. 

Undergraduate candidates 
for membership must have com- 
pleted half of the nursing cur- 



riculum, accumulated at least a 
3.0 GPA, rank in the top 35 per- 
cent of the graduating class and 
demonstrate academic integrity. 

Candidates enrolled in 
graduate programs must have 
completed one-fourth of their 
specified program of study, 
have a GPA significantly higher 
than the minimum required for 
graduation, and displa&gt;cd acad- 
emic integritj'. 

"It is an honor to be a mem- 
ber of the society in terms of 
recognition for students' and 
professionals' personal invest- 
ments in the study of the nurs- 
ing profession," said Freiburger. 

Not only does the Nursing 
Honor Society of Sigma Theta 
Tau recognize superior achieve- 
ment and excellent leadership 
and professionalism in nursing, 
but the organization also 
encourages creative work and 
commitment to improving 
health care worldwide by sup- 
plying informational and finan- 
cial support for research. 

Sigma Theta Tau 

International began the world's 
first complete electronic library 
on the World Wide Web. 

The Virginia Henderson 
International Nursing Library 
enhances access to current nurs- 
ing information, forms electron- 
ic communication networks, 
provides a directory of nursing 
information resources, furnishes 
access to nursing research data- 
bases, provides structure and 
classification schemes to orga- 
nize information about nursing 
research, and disseminates nurs- 
ing research findings to the 



public. 

Since 1936, the Society has 
underwritten more than 250 
grants to cultivate research in 
new aspects of the nursing field. 

In order to share this infor- 
mation with fellow profession- 
als, the International Honors 
Society sponsors a biennial con- 
vention for circulating cutting- 
edge research, information tech- 
nology presentations, and clini- 
cal sessions. 

Locally, the nursing depart- 
ment at IPFW has sponsored an 
annual research colloquium for 
11 years. 

This year the IPFW Honors 
Society will host the event in 
collaboration with the Xi Nu 
Chapter of Sigma Theta Tau at 
the University of Saint Francis. 

"Nursing research for the 
new millennium" will take place 
on Oct. 22 at the IPFW campus. 

The IPFW Honor Socie^' will 
also be working with the Xi Nu 
Chapter on "The Free Book Fair" 
10 he held at the Saint Francis 
Fairfield Campus on March 24 
from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 

The book fair will provide 
access to allied health and nurs- 
ing textbooks. 

The key speaker will be 
Constance R. Tiffany, professor 
emeritus of nursing form 
Andrevv University, in Berrien 
Springs, Mich., 

For more information about 
the IPFW Nursing Honor Society 
or any upcoming event contact 
Sarah Beckman at 481-6015, in 
Neff B50J or e-mail Beckman at

Secretary of athletics, Patricia Klein, lost her bat- 
tle with cancer, on Sundaj', March 

20, while at home. " 

Klein, who has been with the 
university for the last 13 years, was 
very close to students, athletes and 
faculty. 

"She was taken from us much 
to quickly ," Athletic Director Butch 
Perchan said. "She was a mother to 
so many of the student athletes. So 
many of the kids respected and 
loved her." 

The love that Perchan referred 
to is being acknowledged \ ia 
memorials in Klein's memorj to the 

uni\'ersily and the IPFW Athletic 

Scholarship Fund. 

"What I liked best about her 
xvas that she was not sugar-coated and told you how it 
was," said Anna Martin, a payroll clerk in the Human 
Resources. 

Earlier this year. Women's Basketball Coach Pam 
Bowden dedicated their last home game to her. 
Athletics played a large role in Klein's life and she 
played a huge role in the lives around her. 

It shows the kind of person she was and where 
her heart was. Chancellor Michael Wartell said. "M&gt; 
heart goes out to her family. She was a beautiful per- 
son, Al^vays pleasant and supportive." 

Klein is survived by her husband William; two 
sons, Trent and Marc Taylor, and nine grandchildren. 

Klein began working at IPFW in the Financial Aid 
Office in the mid-80s and moved to athletics in 1987. 

"She was one of the first faces you saw entering 
athletics," Wartell said. "That face and smile will be 
missed greatly," 

"It puts things in perspective," said J. Webb 
Horton, the tennis coach. "I got down because we lost 
two matches earlier this weekend, then to come home 
and see a good friend of mine has just passed away. 
Pat was very special to me and this program."

Staff Editorial 



Last week, The Communicator ran a siorv 
about errors with the student discount card pro- 
gram. Originally, students were supposed to be 
able lo lake their ID cards to any of a list of estab- 
lishments and receive some type of discount on a 
service. 

Apparently, though, the representative putting 
this whole thing together from the Student 
Activity Board didn't oother lo get the deals in 
writing. Several students have been unpleasantly 
surprised « ith refusals and confused managers at 
the various establishments. 

When we approached those in charge of the 
program at SAB about the problem, they didn't 
seem all that worried about it. In fact, they say 
that they aren't even going to do anything to cor- 
rect the errors, because there just isn't enough 
lime left in the semester to get the word out to 
every'one who has a card. 

Oka&gt;', hold the phone here There isn'i 

enough time left in the semester to bother letting 
students know nbout the problem? We find this 
unacceptable. 

The problem in question here is not as small 
as SAB would have the community believe for one 
very important reason: It shows a serious lack of 
professionalism. How competent does IPFW look to 
the businesses that signed on to this program in 
pnod faith? How competent does IPFW look in the 
eyes of its own student community? The answer: 
IPFW looks very incompetent. 

How can someone in a position that deals with 
issues such as this program NOT understand that 
some type of contract should have been drawn 
up? The lack of a contract leaves the businesses 
invoUed with the abilit\' to refuse and accept the 
cards as they see fit. 

Oka), we understand that SAB doesn't think 
that the&gt;' have enough time left in the semester to 
"get the word out" to everyone involved in this 
fiasco. Therefore, they are just nol doing anything 
to fix the problems with the current cards. 
Granted, they have a plan in place that virtually 
eliminates the probability that this kind of thing 
will happen with next year's cards. However, that 
sure doesn't fix what's wrong with this year's 
cards. 

Ultimatel), IPFW will pa&gt;' handsomelv for this 
screw-up because our image will suffer a blow that 
it just doesn't need. We think that SAB should 
make an effort to activelv correct the problem. 
After aM, the\ created it.

'Reunion': 

Long-lost siblings meet after 
years of separation 



by Mishanna Wood, 
News Editor 

Imagine being separated 
from your family at the age of 
five and wondering where they 
are and what they're like 
throughout &gt;'Our entire 
childhood. 

Susan, a good friend of mine, 
has endured being separated 
from her biological family for 15 
jeari. 

Due to problems between 
her biological parents, Susan, her 
SL\ year-old sister and se\'en year- 
old brother were adopted into 
different families. 

Her brother and sister lived 
in the same city and remained 
close lo each other. 

Unfortunately, Susan became 
the long-lost sister. 

Over the span of several 
years, Susan has li\ed in four dif- 
ferent states, each one farther 
away from her biological family 
than the last. 

Susan could only remember 
fragments of her former life with 
her biological family such as their 
names, ages, and the state ihey 
lived in. 

She always knew the pieces 
of memor&gt;' and the faint aching 
in her heart could not last 
forever. 

In the back of her mind, 
Susan always intended to contact 
her siblings. 

The time lo contact them 
was constandy a burning ques- 
tion in her mind. 

However, the answer came 
sooner than slie expected. 

Recently, Susan received a 
message from her little sister that 
a man named Dan called. 

"I thought it was a college 
representative. The only Dan I 
knew was my biological brother. 
1 didn't think it would be him," 
said Susan. 

Susan called him back and 
told him she was unaware of his 
identit&gt;'. 

"When I learned he was my 
brother, inside 1 was very 
excited," said Susan. 

Susan said it she has a hard 
time expressing her feelings, Just 
like her brother- 

"When we were talking, we 
' nexer missed a beat. We just 
started talking about our lives. 
Inside we were screaming for joy, 
for we were talking to each 
other!" exclaimed Susan. 



Dan said that he and his sis- 
ter Mist&gt;' always wanted to find 
their little sister but they had to 
wait until she turned 18. 

Worried about what Susan 
would do, the siblings waited \^\^o 
more years before attempting to 
contact her. 

Mist&gt;' and Dan looked up the 
last name of Susan's adopti\i; 
father through a government ser- 
vice called U.S. Search. 

The name and address of her 
home was found on the Ihiernet 
through yahoo.com. 

Since being contacted bj her 
brother, Susan has received pho- 
tographs and learned a great deal 
about her biological familj . 

Dan has been married for 
four years and has worked as a 
manager at several restaurants. 

He wants to go back to col- 
lege to be an accountant. 

Mist&gt; was recently married 
and also gave birth to her first 
child. 

Susan and Misty are both 
cerdfied nursing assistants. 

Susan has also spoken to her 
mother on the phone, 

"She is a hard worker, which 
explains why I am such a hard 
worker. She is an extremely 
happy mom to know about her 
kids," said Susan. 

This general information is 
only the beginning of catching up 
on the last 15 years. 

Susan has jet to meet her 
family face-to-face, but hopes to 
visit them in the summer, 

Susan's adoptive parents 
support her decision to meet her 
family, yet they fear she will be 
hurL 

The reunited sister said she 
will not abandon her adoptive 
family because they have been by 
her side for most of her life. 

So far, there have been no 

conflicts among the separated 
family members. 

"I feel so complete and 
happy, because I now know what 
we all look like. I know that we 
are alike... the way siblings are. It 
has changed my life in a positive 
way," said Susan. 

-All names have been changed to 
protect the subject's identity. 



'Political Correctness': 

Has it gone too far? 



by Matthew Perry, 
Columnist 

What's the deal with all this 
"Politicall) Correct" nonsense? Since 
when is it a federal offense to acci- 
dentally offend anyone? 

People arc so scared that they 
might offend someone that a whole 
new language had to be developed so 
that nothing is offensive to anyone 
anymore. 

Nobody is "short," they are "ver- 
ticallj challenged." Nobody is "old," 
they are "age-enhanced," and just so 1 
don't offend the people who like the 
PC nonsense, nobod&gt; is "stupid," the&gt;- 
are "mentally challenged." 

I was listening to the Bob and 
Tom show before spring break and 
there was a guy who worked in a 
video store- 
He was telling about this new box 
that plugs into the TV that will read 
through the closed captioning and 
replace "offensive" words with new 
"non-offensive" words. 

The example thej used to show 
just how mindless this box is was the 
movie "The Bible" with Charlton 
Heston. 

Anytime the word "God" would 
be said, it would be substituted with 
the "non-offensive" "Gosh." 

How stupid does this sound? "All 
Praise Gosh Almighty!" I'd hate to 
burst the bubble of the creator of this 
box, but that is otTensive to me- 

Granted, I'm not as religious as 



I'd like to be, but I still do believe in a 
creator, and to denj' the existence of 
one is sacrilegious. 

1 sometimes watch the show 
"Politicall) Incorrect." but onl) if 
there is absolutely nothing else on 
and I have absolutely nothing better 
to do with my time. 

One would think that a show 
called "Politically Incorrect" would be 
politicall)' incorrect, but it's not. 

The only thing that comes close 
to being politically incorrect is the 
movie "PCD," where there was a 
group of kids who made fun of any- 
body and anything that crossed their 
paths. 

It is probably illegal to make a 
movie or television show that is offen- 
sive to anyone but white males. 

This minority is the only one that 
can be put down anywhere and at 
anytime. 

I personall)' am a white male, and 
I have many friends that feel the same 
way 1 do. However, not all of these 
friends are white males, white women, 
black men and women, etc. 

There are people out there who 
don't look at the color of one's skin. 

1 have many black and white 
friends. I'm sorry, 1 have many 
"African American" and "Pigmentally- 
Challenged" friends. 

1 also enjoy movies made by 
actors of all different races. 
Christopher Lambert, from 
"Highlander" and "Mortal Kombat" 
fame is my absolute favorite actor. 



But I also love watching'Wesle) Snipes 
and Samuel L Jackson movies. 

In his book "Rising Sun," Michael 
Chrichton said, "The most racist peo- 
ple are the people thai accuse everj- 
one else of being racist." 

How true is this? Think about it 
for a minute. 

Did everyone see "Die Hard: 
With a Vengeance?" 

Remember how Samuel L. 
Jackson's character "Zeus" was always 
accusing Bruce Willis of being a 
racist? 

Think about who the real racist 
was. But, in the world of PC, black 
people cannot be racist. 

After all, white people are not 
entirely to blame for the slavery of 
the last couple centuries, but it is still 
a stain on our record that I am 
ashamed of. 

No man can own another man, 
we can onl) respect each other. 

When we learn to respect every- 
body, regardless of race or gender, we 
can truly be at peace with ourselves. 



"Society is always 
trying in some way or 
other to grind us down 
to a single flat surface." 

-Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. 



Think About It: 

The truth about the IPFW campus 



by Vincent Garcia. 
Columnist 



Well, as some of you may recall, 1 used to write about 
web pages. But those days are gone and I have now been 
given [he freedom to write about whatever I want 

1 didn't get to research anything this week, although 1 
have some good ideas what to write about for next week. 

This week I just wanted to talk about my first year 
here at IPFW. I was told many things, and practically none 
were true. For example: 

Told: It would be a good idea to get to school an hour 
before my first class in order to get a parking spot. 
Tru rft; Still parked my carat Gates and Just watched ESPN 
for an hour every day. Now I've learned m) lesson...l don't 
leave until sometime between 30 minutes before m)- class 
to 5 minutes after. 

7oid: Stud)' some amount of hours per day for each credit 
hour I have. 

Truth; 1 getout of lab at 9 at night 1 take 17 credit hours. 
Even one hour per credit hour would take me until 2 p.m, 
the next day. 



Told: Get used to not being at the top of )'0ur class. 
Truth: I ne\'er was at the top of my class, 

To/d; There is no basement in the Engineering Building. 
Truth: Bored one day, I hopped on the elevator and visit- 
ed this basement/dungeon. 

Told: Learn to value your free time. 
Truth: I have no free time. 

These are most of the platitudes still residing in my 
memory. Some of the things I was told were actually 
right... but not too many, though. My experience at IPFW 
more or less hasn't been too bad. 

Next week 1 was thinking about writing about the 
world-class gladiator arena, also known as the IPFW park- 
ing lot, unless 1 am persuaded otherwise. 

I'd like to finish this with m) quote of the week: "Si tu 
casa es mi casa, tu coche es mi coche, tambienTT?" which 
roughly translates "If ) our house is my house, is your car 
my car, too?" which again roughly translates into "I'm the 
world's biggest moocher." 

In one final translation, that says "M) name is Vincent 
Garcia." 

Have a good one!

State of the World: 

The WWF's world of sports entertainment 




As man)' people now 
know, the World Wrestling 
Federation is coming lo Fort 
Wii)'ne on Wednesday, April 
14. 

Normally, this news 
wouldn't be of any personal 
interest to me but over the 
past few months 1 have found 
myself drawn deeper and 
deeper into the world of 
wrestling. 

I can now look anyone in 
the eyes and tell chem 
straight to their face that I 
am. indeed, a wrestling fan. 

In a way, I consider myself 
new lo the world of being a 
professional wrestling fan. 

Though I was a fan while 
I was an innocent, ignorant 
kid. 1 gave it up when I finally 
realized that (like Santa Claus 
and the Easter Bunny) 
wrestling was fake and full of 
fixed storylines. 

Around the end of last 
summer, however, 1 found 
m\self getting slowl)' addict- 
ed to it once again. 

Wrestling has become for 
men what soap operas stereo- 
i&gt; pically are for women, in 
m; opinion. 

The plot lines in 
wrestling are phenomenal. 

It's obvious to any ratio- 
nal adult thai they're fixed. 

However, they are 
designed not to look realistic 
but to entertain. 



Advertising these e\ents, 
wrestling promoters are 
careful not to designate 
their product as being a 
sport but rather "sports 
entertainment." 
Although there is quite a 
bit of athleticism involved, 
it is merel&gt; designed for 
show. 
The WWF understands 
this the best, in my opin- 
ion, as is clear through 
their ongoing, complex 
storylines and the theatri- 
cal effects used in each of 
their wrestling shows. 

Many of the more popu- 
lar wrestlers in the WWF, for 
example, now use p) rotech- 
nics in their entrance into the 
ring for each event, coupled 
with music and a video dis- 
play on a giant screen. 

The storylines are creat- 
ed to reflect ongoing strug- 
gles or controversial themes 
In societ&gt;'. 

This is evident in not 
only "Stone Cold" Steve 
Austin's battle against his 
employer, WWF owner Vince 
McMahon, but also in such 
characters as "The 

Godfather," whose main gim- 
mick is that of a pimp and 
who shows up to svrestle 
every week with a new batch 
of what he calls "bo's"— paid 
actors pretending to be 
prostitutes. 

Other characters include a 
mentally unstable Hannibal 
Lecter-type character named 
"Mankind," who has recentlj 
become a crowd favorite due 
to the amount of pain he 
endures during his matches. 
and a character calling him- 
self "The Rock" who actually 
played football for the 
University of Miami in 
Florida. 

There are many crossover 
athletes and celebrities that 
have found their way into the 
WWF, making it all the more 



entertaining. 

Most recent was rap sen- 
sation's Insane Clown Posse, 
although in the past such 
celebrities as Mike Tyson 
have found their way into the 
WWF as well. 

The most common type 
of wrestler in the WWF now, 
as a matter of fact, is one who 
became injured or couldn't 
make it in ai. other profes- 
sional sport hut still wanted 
to remain in the hmeljghi. 

Former Denver Bronco 
football ■pla)'e'r Darren 
Drosdoff is a classic example 
of this, as are fomier Ultimate 
Fighting Championship fight- 
ers Ken Shamrock, Steve 
Blackman and Dan Severn 
(although some would sug- 
gest the UFC is nothing more 
than hyped-up wrestling). 

These guys know wrestling 
isn't real; most of the fans 
know wrestling isn't real and 
everyone else knows wrestling 
isn't real. 

That just gives Vince 
McMahon and his company 
more leeway in what they do 
to bring in b igger 
audiences. 

Judging b)' the kinds of 
ratings his shows have been 
getting, apparentl&gt; thej' 
aren't having too much of a 
problem doing that. 

Through great script 
writing, excellent special 
effects and brilliant charac- 
ters, wrestling is quickly 
becoming one of the most 
watched programs in prime 
time television. 

I would be surprised to 
find an empty seat at the 
Coliseum on April 14 when 
the WWF shows Fort Wayne 
what makes them the best in 
"sports entertainment."

All About The Movies 
The 71st Oscars: A rambunctious good time 



On March 21, ihe 7Ist Academy Awards 
offered up more of the same relentlessly 
unpredictable show-stopping moments in a 
four-hour time period that even the host 
deemed as too long, 

Whoopi Goldberg, in her worst perfor- 
mance yet as Oscar ringmaster, laughed her 
way through a night of unforgettable moments, 
unbelievable surprises, and downright enjoy- 
able statuette presentations. 

From Jim Carrey feigning a spout of tears 
over his Oscar nomination snub for Best Actor 
to Anne Heche mocking her own fault&gt; dress 
mike, this show had its moments of embarrass- 
ment as well as its areas of greatness and 
heart-felt hoopla. 

The Oscar-night surprises came with two 
of the biggest awards of the night rather than 
for more minor or secondary awards-and 
nobody ever could have predicted where the 
show was going to go when controversial movie 
"rat" Hia Kazan took the stage. 

Now that the glit? and glamour died down, 
this is my ofncial recap of the "night that the 
stars come out to fawn over each other and 
commemorate themselves," otherwise known 
as the 71sl Academy Awards. 

First off, the show's review wouldn't be 
complete without a criticism of its host, 
Whoopi Goldberg. Goldberg, always pleasant 
and affable in years past when she hosted, 
really tried to bring a more crass style of joke- 
telling to this show. This didn't seem to sit well 
with the masses of movie moguls and titanic 
supersurs. 

Whoopi herself laughed at how she was 
bombing and said, "You all probably want Billy 
back right about now," referring to last year's 
host Billy Cr&gt;st3l. 1 thought she did an okay 
job, but it was easily her least effective Oscar 
effort, as even she said throughout the show, 
lamenting that nobody's ever going to want 
her back in this role. 

This year the awards themselves went to 
many different movies, unlike in years past, 
when films like "Forrest Gump" or "Titanic" 
. dominated and sucked the life out of everyone 
else's chance to gain some acclaim. The three 
films that compiled the most awards this time 
were (and deservedly so) "Saving Private 
Ryan," "Shakespeare in Love" and "Life is 
Beautiful." 

Surprisingly, "Life is Beautiful" came awa&gt;' 
with a major award when ever&gt;body expected 
It would just simplj win the award for Foreign 
Langua^^e film. It did take thai accolade, but 
also brought it"s grand total up to three 
Academy Awards with a statuette for Best 
Actor. 



"Saving Private Ryan" garnered up a 
respectable five Oscar wins for the brilliant 
World War II epic's horrifyingly vivid look at 
what the soldiers of our salvation had to go 
through. 

The real winner, however, was 
"Shakespeare in Love," which received seven 
Oscars, specifically taking the grand-daddy of 
the entire show. 

Best Picture: The entire -%'orld was prob- 
ably left with its collective jaw hanging to the 
ground when "Shakespeare in Love" won this 
award over the monster hit "Saving Private 
Ryan." "Love" was actually my pick for the best 
film of the year, but even I was befuddled 
when the award didn't magically levitate right 
into the hands of "Ryan" director Steven "I- 
crap-more-mone&gt;-lhan-you'll-e\'er-makc-in- 
your-lifetime" Spielberg. 

Best Director: Okay, so Spielberg did 
get his recognition after all; no human being 
that directed so devastating a movie could go 
without getting some kind of honorary award 
and the "man with the golden plan" certainl\ 
deserved to win it this time. {Hopefully, he 
doesn't just throw it into some box with the 
rest of his gazillion awards.) 

Best Actor: In the most shocking sur- 
prise of the show, Roberto Benign! won the Best 
Actor prize over such strong performers as 
Nick Nolte in "Affliction" and Edward Norton 
in "American History X" (both of whom 
deserved to win more than the Italian mad- 
man). 

It must be admitted, however, that Bcnigni 
is a delightful presence and did do an out- 
standing job in one of the year's best movies. 
"Life is Beautiful." It was unlike any other 
moment in Oscar history (and among the fun- 
niest) when Benigni accepted his award (earli- 
er, upon winning the Foreign Film award, he'd 
happily exclaimed that his parents gave him 
the "biggest gift of povcrtj!") and uttered that 
this was a mistake since he'd used up all the 
English he knew earlier in his other acceptance 
speech. 

Honestly, a person hasn't li\ed until 
he/she has seen Benigni jump up in surprise at 
winning and use Billy Bob Thornton's head to 
help stead&gt;- his walk over the backs of major 
movie stars' chairs. Gracia, Roberto-America is 
beginning to lo\e jou! 

Best Actress: As if there was an&gt;' doubt 
at all, Cw)neth Paltrow won for one of the best 
women roles in a long time in "Shakespeare in 
Lo\'e." Actualh-, her acceptance speech was one 
of the most touching moments the Oscars has 
seen in quite a while and will definitely be 
remembered b&gt; this reporter for, the tears it 
could easih bring id an&gt; body's eyes. 

Best Supporjlng Actor: AKAj theJ'Old^ 
Man Award" this~year, as James Coburn" (a 
great actor and first time nominee) won for his 
decent performance in "Affliction." Coburn is 



deserving, but they should have given him a 
lifetime achievement award rather than nomi- 
nate him for one of his good, but not great 
roles. Certainly the general feeling, at least 
between the critics and myself, was that Bill)' 
Bob Thornton was an easy win with his incredi- 
ble performance in the awesome film "A 
Simple Plan." 

Best Supporting Actress: Dame Judi 
Dench finall&gt; won an Academy Award for 
"Shakespeare in Love" after being snubbed for 
her great performance in "Her Majest&gt; , Mrs. 



Brown" last year. Many thought L&gt;'nn Redgrave 
would win for "Gods and Monsters," but that 
film surprising!) won verj' few awards. 

Overall, the Oscars this year were enter- 
taining for the funny bad poinu, emotional 
good points and all-around success as a contin- 
uing legacy for the movie entertainment busi- 
ness. Who knows what kind of surprises and 
adventure await at next year's e\ent as we pass 
into the new millennium.,. 




UNFORTUNATELY. THIS IS WHERE PEOPLE ARE 
PUTTING TOO MANY RETIREMENT DOLLARS. 



Every year, a lot of people make a 
huge mistake on their taxes. 
They wind up sending Uncle Sam 
money they could be saving for 
retirement. 

Fortunately, that's a mistake you 
can avoid with SRAs — tax-deferred 
annuities from TIAA-CREF. SRAs not 
only ease your current tax bite, they 
offer an easy way to build retirement 
income —especially for the "extras" 
that your pension and Social Security 
benefits may not cover. Because your 
contributions are made in pretax 
dollars, you pay less In taxes now. And 
since earnings on your SRAs are tax 



deferred, your money works even 
harder for you. 

Today, we offer other before- and 
after-tax financial solutions, including 
IRAs and mutual funds. They're 
backed by the same investment exper- 
tise, low expenses, and personal 
sen.'ice that have made TIAA-CREF 
the choice of Americas educational and 
research community. 

Why write off the chance for a 
more rewarding retirement? Stop by 
your benefits office or call us at 
1 800 842-2776 and find out how 
TIAA-CREF SRAs can help you enjoy 
happier returns.

Female genital mutilation lawyer discusses struggle for asylum 



by Anne Tonne. 
GuesI Wrtler 

On March 27, ai 2 p.m., in the 
Walb Ballroom, Layli Miller Bashir 
will be speaking about female genital 
mutilation. 

Miller is (he lawyer who Tought 
for the rights of Tauziya Kassindja, 
an African girl whose genital mutila- 
tion case brought large amounts of 
attention to this subject. 

Female genital mutilation is a 
common praciicc throughout Africa, 
India and the Arab countries, whose 
people will often continue the prac- 
tice even after relocating to coun- 



tries that outlaw the procedure. 

"There are reportedly 100,000 
women and girls in America vvho are 
in danger this year," said Joan 
Uebelhoer, an IPFW associate faculij' 
member in Women's Studies, who 
has worked to stop female genital 
mutilation for years. 

There are three widely-prac- 
ticed forms of female genital mutila- 
tion, varying on the operator and 
the tradition of the region. 

"Sunna circumcision" is the 
remo\'al of the clitoral prepuce, the 
cliloral foreskin and the lip of the 
clitoris, although the operator will 



often remo\e part of the labia mine- thorns. 



ra &lt;inner lips) as well. 

The most common procedure 
performed in Africa is "excision cir- 
cumcision," which consists of remov- 
ing the entire clitoris, the adjacent 
parts of the labia minora and all 
external genitalia, with the exception 
of a small portion of the labia majo- 
ra (outer lips). 

"Pharaonic circumcision" con- 
sists of cutting awaj' the entire cli- 
toris and labia minor, then scraping 
the labia majora raw, and sealing 
them together either by stitching 
with catgut or clamping them 
together using 



The majoritj' of mutilations are 
performed by a midwife using a non- 
sterilized knife or razor blade. 

Uebelhoer pointed out that the 
procedure is dangerous not only due 
to the high risk of infections, but 
also due to the complications it caus- 
es during childbirth. 

The main reason given for 
female genital mutilation is religion, 
claiming that it is commanded by 
the Muslim faith. 

Uebelhoer was quick to point 
out that although male circumcision 
is required, female circumcision is 



not mentioned in the Koran. 

Uebelhoer, although she 
believes women must educate others 
on the practice of female genital 
mutilation, said "Men are the ones in 
office who have the power, and so 
thej' are the ones who must make 
and enforce policies to stop the pro- 
cedure." 

Bashir co-wrote "Do Thej' Hear 
You When You Cry?" Kassindja's 
stor\ of her fight to attain political 
asj lum, and founded the Tahirih 
Justice Center.

Man with the Mike 



Men 's tennis team preparing for 'war' 



by Brian Miller. 
Sports Edflor 

The Websters New Collegiate 
Diciionary defines warrior as 
"a man engaged or experi- 
enced in warfare." 

Tennis coach J. Webb 
Honon defines t%:irrior as his 
prototype lennis player. 

"To be an athlete you 
have to be a warrior, You 
have to go compete for one 
thing and that is victor&gt;!" said 
Honon. 

That is exactly what Ben 
Lassanskc did against CI.VC

Rither. 

"We don't have to be 
intimidated." Morton said. 
"We are a good team. One of 
the lop five in the league." 

Lassanske. a transfer from 
Indianapolis, has made an 
immediate impact on the 
team. 

."Ben is a warrior, he has 
mental toughness and ihat is 
all that you can ask for in&gt;a 
player." 

Coach llorton is also get- 
ting superb play in freshman 
"Diaper Dandj " David Wade. 

Wade, only a freshman, is 
taking those first steps to 
becoming a warrior. 

Wade brings with him a 
work ethic unlike no other 
and raw talent that is envied 
throughout the league. 

However, whenever the 
words talent and IPFW tennis 
are joined together, the name 
that always comes to mind is 
Brad)' Spangler. 

"Brady is one of the most 
talented guys this program 
has seen. As soon as he knows 
that, he will gain that mental 
toughness that will push him

Warrior is also a word 
that Horton would use to 
describe the dynamic duo of 
Todd fiwek and Zachary H^rl. 

Fiwek is playing number

ner with Spangler. 

Fiwek, who has started

Big Ten 'representing' at Final Four 



by Bhan Miller, 
Sports Editor 



It's about this time each year that 
Cinderella's clock hits midnight and onlj' 
the contenders are left standing. 

This J ears contender.s are Michigan 
State, Ohio State, Connecticut and Duke. 

"That's right. Baby"- nvo Big Ten 
teams arc still in the Dance, and could 
potenrially meet in the final game, 

MSU is led by Ali-American point 
guard Matean Cleaves, who had Duke on 
his mind last Sunday against Kentuckj', 
tallying ten points and eleven assists. 



Duke, which has not lost since 
December of '98, is inked in on ever&gt;'- 
one's bracket. 

And rightfullj' so, led by Center Elton 
Brand and sharp-shooter Trajan Langdon, 
the Blue Devils go twelve deep. 

NBA General Managers svere asked 
whom they would pick right now if they 
had the first pick in this j ear's draft and 
class was no factor. 

Most GM's said. ..Corey Maggette. 
Maggetle, who isn't even a starter on this 
lalent-laden Duke team, is another prime- 
time player and prime-time example of 
what this team has to offer. 



UConn offers one of the best 1-2 
punches in college basketball with 
Richard Hamilton and Khalid El-Amin. 

That Duo will have to face Jim 
O'Brien and his overachieving Buckejes. 

The Buckejes have arguabl) the best 
backcouri in the Final Four in Michael 
Redd and Scoonie Penn. However, don't 
look for these gujs to get past UConn, 
which should square off against the Blue 
Devils in the final game. 

Look for Brand and Companj' to beat 
up on the Huskies inside and cut down 
the nets in St. Petersburg.
