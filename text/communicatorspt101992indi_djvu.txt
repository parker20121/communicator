NEWS BRIEFS 



LEE LECTURES ON MEDIA'S 
COVERAGE, COVER-IIPS 

Marlin Lee, co-author of "Unreli- 
able Sources: A Guide to Detecting 
Bias in the News Media," will speak 
in Neff Recital Hall on Tuesday at 8 
p.m. He will be the first speaker of 
SAB'S lecture scries. 

The topic of Lee's discussion will 
be "U.S. News Media Bias: Coverage 
or Cover-up?" He is the founder of 
Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, 
which is a national media watch-dog 
organization based in New York. 

Several of Lee's major focuses will 
be the manipulations that occur in the 
American news media, corporate- 
/media cartels, and how a small group 
of people control the largest portion 
of news. 

Jeff Brunson, SAB member, said 
Lee will be an interesting lecturer 
because so much of what actually 
goes on is never reported. "The 
media is being controlled by fewer 
and fewer people, and it wasn't 
always this easy to control so much of 
die public." 

Brunson added he is looking for- 
ward to hearing Lee speak because 
"people need to more aggressively 
seek out alternative forms of informa- 
tion. We can't just passively sit in 
front of a television." 

STUDENT SPOTS TEXT ERROR, 
RECEIVES ROYALTIES 

Would an insecure employee 
respond best to a supervisor who dele- 
gates authority? A student in an 
IPFW business class didn't think so; 
she disagreed with her professor and 
was right. 

As it turns out Jan Glenn, an IPFW 
graduate now pursuing a degree in 
management and marketing, spotted 
an error in her class" textbook. 

"We teach the importance of read- 
ing, but more importantly, we want 
students to know they can say, 'Hey, 
this doesn't make sense! Can you 
explain this to me.' Jan spoke up and 
she was right," said Edwin Leonard, 
associate professor of management 
and marketing. 

After his class discovered the error, 
Leonard said he would call one of the 
authors of the textbook. Robert 
Kreimer. 

Upon receiving the call, Kreitner 
offered Glenn his half of the text- 
books royalties for spotting the error. 
Leonard presented the royalties to 
Glenn in class about a week later. 

The diagram in Kreitner's book, 
"Organizational Behavior." attempted 
to explain which leadership qualities 
work best with which employees. 
The error reversed the information. 

Close supervision and specific 
instructions were suggested for confi- 
dent and able employees, while turn- 
ing over responsibility was offered for 
unable or unwilling workers.

Enrollment jumps sixth straight year 



By Sarah Jakackj 
Chief Reporter 

IPFW's cnroMmenl surpassed 
12,000 for the second year, and 
for the sixth consecutive year 
set a registration record, accord- 
ing to Registrar Jack Dahl. 

Dahl said cniollment is up 
from 12,077 in fall 1991. lo 
12.090 this year. Last fall stu- 
dents were enrolled for 103,404 
credit hours. This fall credit 
hours increased to 103.961. 



Although enrollment is 
increasing, Dah! said the growth 
was smaller than in previous 
years. He noted that while fewer 
students are choosing IPFW 
there arc loo many students and 
not enough classes available. 

"The most important thing I'm 
trying to communicate is that we 
are not able lo nneel the demands 
for courses," explained Dahl, 

He attributes the problem to 
the budget situation and lack of 



facilities, which will be partially 
diffused when the Engineering 
building opens in the spring. 

"The most important thing 
I'm trying lo communicate 
is that we are not able to 
meet the demands for 
courses." 

-Jack Dahl 

Because of space and faculty 
limitations, students arc now 
[uming away because they were 



unable to gel into core courses. 

Dahl said, "We're looking to 
open more classes, but the 
course offerings will probably 
not expand." 

According to Dahl, large 
enrollment increases were 
reported in audiology and speech 
sciences, biology, chemistry, 
English and linguistics, geo- 
sciences, mathematical sciences, 
and political sciences.

Campus tutoring service helps 
students with tough classes 



By Mary Shrock 
Features Editor 

If you're having a hard time in 
calculus or Spanish, you don't 
need to pay an expensive private 
tutor for the service, 

IPFW provides two hours of 
tutoring per week for students 
free of charge. 

Located in the Transitional 
Studies office in room 202 of 
Keidcr Hall, the tutoring service 
is a valuable aid for some stu- 
dents. 

Senior radiology major. Julio 
Marqucz, said he thought tutor- 
ing really improved his ability to 
Icain math. 

"1 don't like math. I don't 
know how well I would'vc done 
without the tutoring, but I did get 
an 'A'," Marquez said, 

Marquez also noted that he is 
using his math skills in many of 
his radiology classes. 



Tutors for the program, howev- 
er, arc not professional teachers. 
They are students who go 
through an interviewing process. 

Once potential tutors fill out 
an application, they must sub- 
mit several letters of recom- 
mendation. 



"You learn a lot while 
tutoring people" 
'Rizwan Farooq 

Sally Finch, secretary of the 
Transitional Studies department, 
said that there arc 25-30 people 
tutoring students this semester. 

According lo Finch, 874 stu- 
dents signed up for tutoring ser- 
vices during the 1991-1992 
school year. 

Finch added that math and 
chemistry are the most popular 



subjects to be tutored in. 

"Most tutors come back semes- 
ter after semester. We've had a 
lot of great reports and students 
who keep coming back. I think 
that's a really good sign," Finch 
said. 

One tulor, Rizwan Farooq who 
has been tutoring for two years, 
said he has also learned a lot by 
helping other students, 

"You learn a lot while you're 
tutoring people. It srays with 
you." Farooq said. 

Farooq, who came to the 
United Stales from Pakistan, aids 
students in malh and engineer- 
ing. He was quick to add that 
there is a great demand for tutors 
in math. 

"1 think there are a lot of people 
who need help in malh. Thai's 
what most of the people are ask- 
ing for," Farooq said. 



Help wanted 

Student senate ruled by three 



were health sciences, public 
administration, and theater. 

Until, and if, the budget is 
approved by state legislature, 
Dahl said the problem will only 

increase. 

"We're doing everything we 
can to increase the course ofTer- 
ings and enrollment demands. 
We use our facilities more inicn- 

sivcly than any other university 
in the state," added Dalil. 



Wonder Walb 

Student union offers 
break from the grind 



By Mike Wade 
Managing li^ilor 

Offering a wide range of stu- 
dent services and activities, llie 
Walb Memorial Union is a hub 
of campus life at IPFW. 

The Sweet Shoppe, located on 
the firsi floor of Walb Memorial 
Union, offers a variety of ser- 
vices lo IPFW students, faculty 
and staff. 

"With a photo ID and a valid 
siudent services card, wc will 
cash checks for students," said 
Georgia Perry, manager of the 
Sweet Shoppe and the siudent 
recreation center. 

Students may also use the fax 
machine lo either send or receive 
facsimiles. 

"They can fax anywhere in ihe 
contincnial United States and 
Pueno Rico for SI.90 Ihe first 
page and 65 cents for each addi- 
tional page. They can receive 
faxes from anywhere for only 15 
cents per page," said Perry, 

For die movie buff, the Sweet 
Shoppe offers discount vouchers 
for local movie theaters. 

Three dollars will buy a ticket 
from Holiday, Georgetown, and 
Quimby theaters. 

Four dollars will snag a ticket 
from Coldwaier Crossing, Nonh- 
wood or Souihtown iheaicrs. 



Fori Wayne Philharmonic 
vouchers are also available, ll 
will end up running four dollars 
per ticket. 

"Your given assigned seals, 
and you usually end up with real- 
ly good seats, even if you wail 
till the last minute to purchase 
the tickets, although you'll prob- 
ably get better seals if you get 
tickets early," said Perry. 

For siudenis wilh some time to 
kill between classes, the student 
recreation center may help white 
away ihe time. 

Students can play pool for two 
cents per minute. 

"It's really a good deal, I don't 
know of anyplace else that offers 
pool for that much money." said 
Perry. 

"It's good lo gel your mind off 
classes and come in and play 
pool. It's also a good place lo 
meet people, and hey it's a heck 
of a bargain," said Josh 
Smiihson, an IPFW student. 

Students can also play ping- 
pong for two cents a minute. 
And they can purchase a ball for 
twenty cents. 

"However, if the students have 
their own paddles, they can play 
pingpong for free." said Perry. 

The recreation ccnier also has 
air hockey and video games,

Managing Editor 

IPFW student senate already 
faced some major setbacks in 
operation. 

Mike Will, elecicd siudent sen- 
ate president, resigned from the 
office, effective Aug. 31, 

Outside responsibilities forced 
the resignation, according to 
Will, 

"My student teaching schedule 
has been unbelievable. I jusi 
don't have the lime to continue 
with student government," said 
Will. 

Will's resignation allowed 
president pro-tcmporc Elbert 
Websier to move into the posi- 
tion of president of the student 
senate, 

"I have the utmost confidence 



in Rajat Sun and Elbcn Websier 
and the way they'll run the sen- 
ate," concluded Will. 

Webster said he wanted to 
make the senate more accessible 
to siudenis, 

"We need some 
senators" 

-Elbert Webster 

"We've got a good group of 
people here, and we're looking 
to get it all together, but wc need 
some senators," said Websier. 

CurrcnUy the senate is made up 
. of the senate president and ihrce 
student senators. 

One of the student senators, 
Kent Jackway was elected the 



new president pro-iempore. 

"At least wc aren't having 
problems meeting quorum. We 
have had 100 pendent attendance 
so far, It's just that we only have 
three senators," said Webster. 

Students who wish lo petition 
for a seat on ihe student senate 
should pick up an application 
from the siudcnts government 
office on the second floor of 
Walb Memorial Union, 

Webster said ihe main priority 
for student senate is to recruit 
more senators. 

He also said the senate was 
looking into the possibility of 
hosting a Gorc-Quaylc debate on 
campus. 

So far the senators are wail- 
ing for responses from the two 
candidates. 



Thief targets lockers 
in Athletic Center 



By J. William Richardson 
Copy Editor 

A Saturday aflcrnoon theft 
at the Athletic Ccnier under- 
scored ihc need for students to 
lake precautions against cam- 
pus crime, according to Police 
Chief Lauren DenHanog. 

Property valued at approxi- 
mately S70 was removed 
from several lockers in the 
men's locker room Saturday 
afternoon. 

"Damage lo the lockers may 
be greater ihan the value of 
the properly taken." the Chief 
said. He noted dial while Uierc 
are no suspects at ihis lime, 
police do have a description of 
the culprit and are investigat- 
ing die case. 

"Most of our crime is rela- 
uvely small iheft from the uni- 
versity," said DcnHartog. 

Still precautions against per- 
sonal theft and injury are 
advised by the department of 
police and safety, which pub- 
lishes a list of safely tips for 
siudenis, faculty, and staff. 

Tips include: when walking 
lo your car, especially after 
dark, try to walk with a group; 
make sure your car is locked 
and don't leave items of value 
in view in your parked car. 

Other lips include: don't 
ever leave purses or bookbags 
unattended, even for just a 
minuie. Also, don't ever prop 
open outside doors of build- 
ings. It may be a convenience 



for you, but it is an open invi- 
tation to unwarned parties or 
vandalism. 

"Wc have a pretty safe envi- 
ronment.," said DenHanog, 
"bui theft can happen any- 
where." 

Parking tickets arc being 
issued at a slower rate this 
fall, according to ihe Chief, 
"The parking silualion seems 
better," he added, "fewer peo- 




ple arc parking illegally." 
New, siiffcr fines for 
lions imposed by the 
ty last spring, may be a con-

Forget the computers; 
library needs more books 



How many books does it take to 
fill the Helmke Library? 

Obviously not many. 

If you haven't taken advantage of 
the full power of the library, perhaps 
you haven't missed that much. 

Perhaps this is too harsh. Like 
many other facilities on this campus 
it is underutilized and underrated by 
much of the student populace. 
However, this image and usage issue 
may point to a bigger problem. 

WHERE ARE THE BOOKS? 

Students have access to vast com- 
puter resources and indexing power 
at IPFW's stronghold of informa- 
tion. Unfortunately for these same 
students this computerized card-cat- 
alog could probably be done almost 
as easily on index cards in recipe 
boxes. 

Available volumes of material are 
the backbone of a well-stocked 
library. While resources are squan- 
dered on doctoral research volumes 
and over-computerization, the 
shelves we need grow bare. 

STUDENTS PAY THE BILLS. 

Through taxation and 'tuition the 
students of this university and the 
citizens of Indiana pay the bills at 
IPFW. Students are on a tight sched- 
ule. Many students have other 
responsibilities such as full-time 
employment and parenthood. 

IPFW students don't have a week 
or ten days to wait for an inter-cam- 
pus transfer. If your assignment is 



due tomorrow you may have better 
luck driving to Bloomington to get 
the information you need. 

This is not to say that no one finds 
this system useful. It is usually con- 
venient and economical to be able to 
get hard-to-find texts from 
Bloomington. But why can't IPFW 
allocate more money on books for 
its students — not for its faculty 
research volumes. 

WE DESERVE BETTER. 

The "information age" is hoarding 
library monies and putting a stran- 
glehold on the users of the library. 
Access is what we have. 
Information is what we need. Hard 
information in books, not on disks. 
IPFW's administaration must take a 
closer look at the Helmke library's 
priorities and goals. 

The question is, "Who is being 
served?" 

The Helmke library serves librari- 
ans and administrators while stu- 
dents scratch and claw to get the 
services they need to survive and 
succeed in a competitive educational 
environment. 

Library resources are a vehicle for 
learning. The flash and beep super- 
computer method may impress visit- 
ing politicians and insulated, ivory- 
tower administrators but the real 
students know that there is a 
problem and they won't sit until its 
corrected.

National speed limit too damned slow 



By J. William Richardson 
Copy Editor 

As of this writing. I have 
not received any response to 
my last column. My feelings 
arc hurt. 1 know you're read- 
ing my work, but if 1 am to 
lead you through the ideolog- 
ical darkness. I must know 
what pan of the cave you live 
in. 

Today's Topic: 
Speed Limits 

Arc Ihe seemingly trivial 
traffic regulations we live 
wilh today really of any bene- 




fit to the populace? Generally 
they are. Stoplights and turn 
signals regulate the flow of 
traffic and prevent collisions. 
Strong drunk driving legisla- 
tion, if properly enforced, 
could save diousands of live.s 
and prevent millions of dol- 
lars in property damage and 
personal injury losses to 
insurance companies (and 
policyholders). 

Speed limits are trivial and 
destructive and misguided 
and overproiectivc. 



Why is there a speed limit? 
Docs it prevent death and 
destruction on rural stretches 
of Interstate 69 and U.S. 
Highway 30? Arc the few 
accidentia diat occur on these 
roads caused by exceeding 
the posted speed limit? It is 
unlikely that speed is even a 
contributing factor in these 
mishaps. 

Drunk driving and basic 
stupidity are more likely the 
.culprits. 

Speed limits have one 
major purpose: Revenue gen- 
eration. This hidden tax robs 
from the middle-class and the 
poor and feeds the govern- 
ment fatcais and the insur- 
ance peddlers. 

Your choice lo exceed the 
speed limit and your misfor- 
tune in being a state trooper's 
sacrificial iamb can lead loan' 
expensive contribution to the 
general fund of the county of 
your infraction. Eight hours 
of defensive driving class 
and SlOO in fines later you 
may regret your choice and 
your circumstance. 

What is Uncle Sam's goal? 
Has he imposed the national 
65 mph speed limit as a sav- 
ior of the innocent traveler or 
as another wing of the con- 
trol- frenzied federal bureau- 
cracy? 

If his goal is to save your 
life, he's taking the wrong 
route. Breathalyzing the local 
lavem-gocrs on their way to 
the mean streets could save 
your life. Stripping licenses 
from habitual offenders could 
save your life. Imposing a 
maximum driving age and 



raising the minimum age 
limit for driving could save 
your life. 

Scoping you from afar with 
carcinogenic radar beams will 
not save your life. It's really 
irrelevant how fast your car is 
travelling when a drunk 
crosses the center line of the 
highway. With your head 
removed 95 and 55 will feci 
very similar. Will the speed 
limit save you when tliat 92 
year-old decides to disregard 
that red light and crushes you 
wilh his 1976 Cutlass? 

You are the victim. Speed 
limits penalize even the best 
of drivers. Speed limits give 
the insurance industry anoth- 
er reason to raise your rales. 
Speed limits mock safety 
advances and delay highway 
improvements. Speed limits 
hurt American business by 
culling die efficiency of over 
the road shipping; 

How can you change it? 
Call Jill Long. Call Evan 
Bayh. Call George Bush (or 
Bill Clinton, depending on 
your political preference). 
Tell them how you feel. If 
they don't feel the same way. 
vote for someone else on 
election day. 
Short Takes 

Are you ready lo vote yet? 
Register now if you haven't 
already. Know the issues. If 
you don't know what's going 
on and you plan to vote based 
on the trivialities and mud- 
slinging you hear in the 
media, do us ait a favor. Stay 
home. 

Why has public trans- 
portation been dumped as a 



public priority? The over- 
whelming advantages envi- 
ronmentally and economical- 
ly have been overwhelmed by 
the lobbying power and 
financial weight of the 
automakers and their eco- 
nomic cohorts, oil companies 
and Ihc UAW. If you could 
get to work and school on 
time every day for pennies on 
clean, safe, efficient public 
transportation, you wouldn't 
have much need for your own 
car, would you?. 

Will the real Dan Coals 
please stand up? In his cur- 
rent TV spots Dan stands up 
for term limiis and against 
career politicians. Isn't he 
running for re-eleciion? For 
once, Dan, wc agree. Career 
politicians arc a problem. Do 
' us both a favor. Don't go 
■back 10 Washington. . .. 

Has the baseball season 
been lengthened to 500 
games? Perhaps Ihe new 
commissioner should look at 
culling back this never-end- 
ing deluge of boredom.. 

Am I the only person who 
spits on non-handicapped 
cars parked in handicapped 
parking spaces? 

Someone needs to step for- 
ward and slop the infomer- 
cialisls. Their drivel, while 
certainly more entertaining 
and redeeming than "Full 
House" or "Who's the 
Boss?", is a mockery of the 
true possibilities of mass 
communication. Re-runs of 
"Andy Griffith" certainly 
lake priority in my book. 



Bell curves botch grading process 



By Mike Wade 
Managing Editor 

Many professors grade on a 
bell-shaped curve. These pro- 
fessors reinforce the idea, "It is 
Doi enough lo succeed; others 
musi fail." The professors are 
probably unaware Uiat they are 
promoting diat idea, bui diey 
promoic it none-die-lcss. 

A person's success should 
not rest on another's failure. If 
only one person could be suc- 



cessful, we could ciiiicr have 
the lighlbulb or the teleplione, 
but not both. We all benefit 
from the success of others; that 

Commentary 

is what makes it a success. 

In a class where die professor 
grades on a curve, ihe quality 
of a work would go up and 
down depending on the abili- 



ties of liie other people in the 
class. U would be possible for 
an 'F' student in one class to 
be belter educated than an 'A' 
student in another class. 

It seems that the instructors 
who grade on a curve are 
unable to determine what con- 
sliiuies satisfactory work. 
These instructors then allow 
the students lo determine what 
constitutes satisfactory work. 
If die students arc qualified lo 



make such judgments, why do 
ihcy need the professors? 

And if these professors are 
unable lo determine which 
works arc salisfacioty, how can 
ihey deiermine which works 
are bctler than other works? 

The practice of grading on a 
curve should be eliminated. It 
insults the intelligence of the 
professors and die siuclenis.

Fashion divas deliver 
fall fashion forecast 



By Mary Shrock and 

Sarah Jakacky 

Fashion Consultants lo (he Masses 

Milan and Paris aren'l the only 
fashion mcccas for finding trendy, 
ulua-hip designs. 

Just laltc a walk around ihe IPFW 
campus someiime and you'll see a 
unificaiion of styles bridging the 
global rifl between American lasies 
and European vogue. 

And by following a few simple 
guidelines you too can roam ihe 
Campus of Slylc. 

First, plaid is the word this fall. 
Plaid shins, plaid jackcls and plaid 
pants. Although you must ewrcise 
caution and some down-right com- 
mon sense with the plaid pants. 

•••Just remember, yout butt 
always looks two sizes bigger in 
plaid. 

Another big item to come from 
designers like Donna Karan and 
Calvin Klein is the one-piece body 
suit. It looks like a lop but it's really 
one of those snap-at-lhe-croich job- 
bics. Perfect for underneath a busi- 
ness suit or with jeans. 

INvo sensational smashes for Sep- 
tember include the velvet red catsuit 
with lots of zippers, and plenty of 
accessorizing. Big hair and bright 
lips will lop off ihis look. 

Hoods will prove lo be a-head of 
the compciiiion in the fall. This 
look will encompass Ihe casual. 



classy, and business looks, A new 
innovation in hoods is to wear il as 
part of a business suit ensemble 
under a blazer. 

Let's not forget our feet. Platform 
shoes arc the hoiiesl liend in feet 
this fall. For a little "lifl" in your 
life just buy a funky pair of zebra 
skin lifts. "'Butdon't forget that 
the platforms will make you about 
two inches laller, so if your man has 
a complex about Amazon women — 
dump him, what does he know about 
fashion? 

No matter what style of shoe you 
choose, buckles and wide heels are a 
must this season. 
Long, easy and fluid are the images 
for Ihis Fall. Mini-anyihing is oui. 
But hot, hoi . hoi will be ankle 
lengihs. This, of course, refers 
mostly to women's fashions, 
although it is rumored that gauchos 
for men could be the next irend. 

Another siz-iling look will be the 
Harlcy Davidson biker clothes. 
Leather jackets, pants and boots 
complete the lough-girl image for 
easy riders. 

The most stunning and catchy rage 
this season will be temporary tat- 
toos. For those not ready for a per- 
manent commitment, temporaries 
can fill in the fleshy gaps used lo 
capture the imagination. 

For this fall though, just remember, 
no siyle is the hippesl style of all.

Man, I'd rather be playing golf 
instead of rotting in CM hell 



Dy Jim Walker 
Editor in Chief 

Today, I wepi. In Walb Memorial 
Union, in the Fort cafeteria, eaiing a 
rubber chicken sandwich - I wcpi. 

Why were you crying lililc boy? 
You ask. prying like a weasel inio 
the most personal nooks of my psy- 
che. Well, I'll lell youSmany, if you 
musi know. I don't wanna be here. 

I don't wanna be in f-ing Walb or 
Helmke or Kettler or thai fcaiurclc^s 
bunker CM. I wanna be oui on the 
links. I wanna be playing golf. 

I wanna be Dan Quayle. 

This summer I had one of those 
jobs thai allows a "worker" lo com- 
picic his appointed tasks in like a 
day and a half. So I had none of that 
bread earning bunk lo interfere with 
the more important summer activi- 
ties. 

This summer I played golf, played 
Softball, played golf, played sand 
volleyball, played golf, played wif- 
fleball, played golf, played basket- 
ball and then played some golf. 

In between I ate Val-U-Meals 
from McDonald's, 

Needless to say, I did a lot of 
macho CTOich grabbing and scratch- 
ing and spitting and hai wearing, 1 
think my chest hair grew six inches. 

And there was certainly no time 
for dames. 

Bui I did fall in love - with the 
game ofgolf, that is. 

Why do I love golf so? Oh, lo 
know, know, know golf is to love, 
love, love golf. 

Why. it's the only sport you can 
play Just fine wearing a white 
leather jump suit. It's the only sport 
you can play just fine with a lit ciga- 
rette in your mouth. It's the only 
sport with beer as its official 
refreshing beverage. 

Saew that Crystal Light crap! I'll 
lake a Bud. 

•Td like to stop here for a brief 
disclaimer. I'm not really a beer 
slugging jock who refers to wymin 



as "dames." Oh no. quite the oppo- 
site is true. That silliness was 
included for a comedic effect. It's a 
character thing. A persona I made 
up. So all ofyou sensitive GAP

for classes can just chuckle along 
with the rest of us, because now you 
are in the know. 

Back to golf. I love it because it is 
the only sport where you can legally 
kill a guy. 

Once in a while, I'll tee off with a 
wicked slice sending the ball 
SCTcaming over into another fairway. 
There, an unsuspecting guy in a 
plaid hat is plimked on the noggin. 

He falls to the neatly manicured 
grass dead as a door mat. "I got a 
good bounce!" I say when ii 
bounces off his head and back 
towards my hole. 

As I walk over to the ball, a 
groundskeeper hurries by in a cart 
and picks up the limp plaid hat guy. 
I think they bury the dead ones 
back in the woods. But who knows 
and who cares? 

Another great thing about golf is 
the wonderful social inieraaion you 
can have while playing with your 
pals. 

"So Rick, what did you get?" I'd 
often say. 
"A six," he might answer. 



"Oh," I return. And it goes on 

from there. 
But best of all. golf is a perfect 

spawning ground for tall talcs. 

Every time golf stories arc repeat- 
ed, the holes get longer, the weather 
worse and the strokes fewer. Here. 
for your enjoyment, are a couple 
I've been stretching lately. 

THE SEMI TRUCK SHOT 

So I was playing the other day 
during a thimdersiorm. I was on this 
350 yard hole that ran along a state 
highway. Well, my tee shot took its 
usual wicked slice and went scream- 
ing towards the highway and away 
from the hole. 

I thought, "Man that's over the 
road!" But just as the ball reached 
the highway, a semi truck pulled 
into view. 

My ball bounced off the truck's 
trailer and right onto the green. 1 
pulled in for the eagle. 

THE SWAMP OF DEATH 

So I was playing the other day 
during Hurricane Andrew. I was on 
this course with a marshy area in the 
middle. Well, my lee shot landed 
right in the middle of the damned 
swamp. So I decided to test the 
ground and edge out to my ball. 

I look one step too many and sunk 
in to my knees, 1 started to sink even 
funher. h was quick sand! 

I deftly chipped my ball out of the 
swamp, then grabbing a tree branch, 
pulled myself to safely. 

When I goi lo the green I found 
that I had hit the ball 250 yards with 
my sand wedge. The ball was inches 
from the hole! I putied in for the 
birdie. 

And ihere are a hundred more sto- 
ries where those came from. 

So my summer is nostalgia. My 
summer is dead. The tears are 
welling again in my eyes. 

I wipe my face with my Top Rite 
lowel and resolve to go on.

Athletic Center bargain for students 



Dy Joe He«rsche 
Sports Editor 

I always knew 1 had lenible luck, 
bui tiow I have pioof. 

In iwo instances last semester, I 
went to the Athletic Center in an 
attempt to create a physique mod- 
eled in SoloFlcJi infomercials and lo 
work on a perfect dribble move 
toward the basket even Michael 
Jordan would try to imitate. 
However, the entire athletic center 
was closed for a science fair in one 
attempt, and the other time the gym- 
nasium was closed for a former vol- 
leyball players' convention. 

As you can imagine, my dreams of 
shirtless days parading around 
Pokagon State Park Beach and 
hours of asphalt pounding in my 
Nike Air Jordans at Lakeside Park 
were suddenly erased with the nee- 

IPFW Sports 
' Spotlight 

die sharp pencils in the young 
Einstein's gcekpacks. 

Being the investigative reporter 
that I am, I decided to uncover this 
conspiracy, and bring a voice lo the 
iraumaiizcd jocks being persecuted 
by academic snobs and misguided 
administrators borrowing their facil- 
ity and ruining their stringent work- 
out schedule. 

1 decided to be the Jesse Jackson 
to IPFW body builders, Patsy 
Schrocder to aspiring maraihoners, 
Randall Terry to aerobic 
dancers... .or so I thought anyhow. 

The proof of my bad luck was that 
my terrible ordeal had never 
occurred to any of these unrepre- 
sented athletes I interviewed. 

In fact, most of these athletes were 
more than content with the Athletic 
Center and its staff. 

Really though, this never surprised 
mc, and in the back of my mind I 
always had doubts of this protest 
organization ever getting off the 
ground. For a mere S25 in fees you 
participate in nimtcrous sports. 

Graduate student Kaihy Freiburgcr 
showed her support of the facility 
by saying, "It is definitely worth the 
student fee." 

Part-time student Tim Wagner 
thinks it is a bargain also. "You 
could pay S300 at places in Fort 
Wayne to lift," Wagner said. ■ 

Scoti Michael and Scan Watkins 
had to pay S7 each per visit during 
ihe summer to lift ai the YWCA, 

Super athlete Terry Lymon has 
seen many facilities and ranks IPf^ 
near the top. "It is eKccUenu There 



15 YEAR 
MORTGAGE 



is a lot of room and it is in good 
condition." Lyman said. 

While in pursuit of a story that 
wasn't there lo report, several legiti- 
mate concerns were voiced about 
the Athletic Center. 

The most prolific complaint was 
the summer hour schedule and the 
guest pass policy. 

"During the summer, they definite- 
ly need to be open more hours, at 
least on the weekend," student Larry 
Laudig said. 

"Now that we're back into the fall 
semester the hours arc good, but 
during the summer it was very 
poor," Fricburger said. 

The current guest policy requires 
that the student or faculty member 
purchase a pass at least two hours in 
advance of using the facility. 

Concerning the guest policy, 
Junior John Brock, a supervisor 
widi the facility said, "They (admin- 
istrators) think that using the facility 
is a privilege, and they don't want 
just anyone off the street coming in 
with a student. They think that 
these type of people wouldn't 
respect ihc e^juipment as much." 

Brock said this is the complaint he 
fields most often. 

Both of these complaints arc more 
inconvenient for atliletcs than dan- 
gerous, but the final complaint is 
more serious and may actuaJly place 
users in danger. 

After a walk around inspection 
with the help of an experienced 
bodybuilder, some of the Athletic 
Center's equipment was shown to 
be antiquated, designed poorly, or 
bodi in some cases. 

The lat pull down, a black exercise 
machine, was the most seriously 
flawed. 

The maintenance staff had 
replaced the pulleys on the machine 
widi ones of less diameter when the 
original pulleys broke. 

This caused numerous problems. 
With smaller pulleys, the cables do 
not slide properly. This causes the 
cables to catch on the edges of the 
metal of (he structure and could 



cause the athlete to lose control of 
die weights. 

Both the 70 lb and 80 lb weights 
were cracked at the time of the 
inspection, possibly due lo this 
problem. This situation only exac- 
erbated the problem because a lifter 
would need to go directly from a 60 
lb lift to a 90 lb lift. 

A second example is the incline 
bench press. The bench is too high 
off the ground and many lifters are 
not able to support and balance 
themselves on the floor. 

There are other flaws, such as not 
enough well-designed bench press 
stations, but I do not have enough 
column space to address them all, 
and a solution does exist for all of 
die problems. 

A regular maintenance schedule, 
including a periodical assessment of 
equipment for needs such as 
replacement, adding additional 
equipment, or removing equipment 
is the answer. 

Anyone that visits the Athletic 
Center on a weekday at 5 p.m. will 
realize that the facility, even widi its 
flaws, is a good bargain and very 
popular. 

(i^ollcge students that take advan- 
tage of a good bargain such as a 
S.50 draft beer at local bars, de- 
finitely sec the value in $25 for a fit- 
ness club membership.

The IPFW women's volleyball 
team won three matches and lost 
two in the Grand Valley State 
Tournament over the Labor Day 
weekend. 

In the first match. IPFW faced the 
University of Alaska-Fairbanks and 
lost in five games, 15-11, 15-13, 9- 
15. 6-15. 15-10. "Alaska was the 
toughest team we played," said head 
coach Lisa Sheehan, Freshman 
Heather Teagarden had 15 kills in 
the match. "Heather played very 
well for us,"'Sheehan added. 

Oakland University was the 
Volleydon's second match on Friday 
and their first victory of the season. 
IPFW needed only three games to 
defeat Oakland, 15-9,15-5,15-10. 

Julie Hubcr and Danielle Bertien 
led IPFW widi ten kills apiece. 

Berlien was added to the team 
only a few days before the tourna- 
ment. "She brought a lot of experi- 
ence to the middle because of her 
maniriiy," Sheehan said. 

Berlien graduated from Bishop 
Luers High School in 1987 and was 
offered a full-ride scholarship to 



Ohio Slate, but decided to alicnd 
IPFW to conceniiaie on her studies. 

This is the first season Berlien has 
competed in since 1987. 

In the final match on Friday, the 
Volleydon's beat Lake Superior 
State University, 14-16. 15-6, 15- 
5.16-14.

lime to host Grand Valley State by 
scores of 11-15, 12-15. 15-13, 15- 
12,14-16. 

Joy Thayer had a match high 21 
kills and Hubcr added 19 for IPFW, 

The final match of the toumamcni 
for IPFW was succcaful with an 8- 
15. 15-10, 15-5, 15-10, win over the 
University of Wisconsin-Parksidc. 

Hubcr had 11 kills to lead the 
Volleydons, and Shannon Smith and 
Teagarden each added eight 

Teagarden injured her ankle on 
Saturday and her status is not known 
yet. "Heather was hitting from tlic 
front row and the back row for us. 
Heather played very good," Sheehan 
said. 

IPFW's next match is the IPFW 
Mark Fore Classic this weekend.

THE COMMUNICATOR 



Thursday. September 10, 1992 



IPS!^CkA. from the president's desk: 




'iflGH'V^ 



Dear Students: 



Welcome to all of those students attending IPFW for the first 
time this semester, and thank you for selecting IPPA' as your 
university. Welcome back to all of you who are returning this 
fall. 

I would like to inform you of how your student government 
association operates, and of a few of the many benefits it 
provides to all of you. 

Indiana-Purdue Student Government Association (IPSGA) con- 
sists of four branches: the executive branch, the legislative 
branch (student senate), the programming branch (Student 
Activities Board), and the judicial court. 

IPSGA deals with all matters which directly affect the quality 
of education and quality of student life at IPf^. The Student 



Senate is charged with addressing the needs of the student body through 
legislation. SAB deals with the social and programming activities of and 
for the students. The judicial court serves as a court of appeal in all 
IPSGA matters. 

Even though we are just three weeks into the semester, IPSGA is already 
working for you. Some of the things which have been accomplished or 
provided for you thus far are: 

• A voluntary service board for philanthropic services 

• Student discount package 

• Biweekly campus calendar in The Communicator 

• Funding for various student organizations 

• Representation on university administrative and faculty committees 

• Fall kickoff 

• Weekly movie series 

• Biweekly alternative movie series 

• Biweekly lecture series 

• Biweekly midday diversions 

In the future, expect IPSGA to address the following issues: 

• Expansion of Walb Union 

• Child care consortium 

• Debate between candidates of November election 

• Legal aid service for students 

• Establishment of a health clinic on campus 

• Voters registration on campus 

• Earth Day festivities and events 

• More student organizational space 

I strongly encourage you to join student government. There are also 
many university- wide committees which require student members. Take 
an interest in having a voice in your education at this university. 

Student government exists for you. Your participation, suggestions, 
comments, and criticisms are needed for IPSGA to be an effective voice 
of the student body. FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE FEEL FREE 
TO STOP BY MY OFFICE. WALB 225-B OR CALL ME AT 481-6588, 

Sincerely, 



unzip your lip! Let your uoiee 
lie heard!

Activities Board)
