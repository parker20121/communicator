With dreams much larger than a jeweled crown, ten contestants competed with 
the knowledge that only one will walk away with the title of Miss IPFW.

The fourth annua! Miss IPFW Scholarship Pag- 
vas held Saturday. Oct. 28 in Neff 101. 

took part in the pageant- which in- 
and talent, swimsuil, and evening 
wear competitions-with the hopes of walking away 
with not only a new title, but also $1,150 in scholar- 
ship money. 

Emily Hart, a freshmen interior design major, 
walked away with both the People's Choice award 
and the title of Miss IPFW. 

"This has been a dream of mine ever since I was a 
little girl," said Hart. 

Hart, who has never competed in a pageant be- 
fore, said she did not expect to win the Miss IPFW 
Scholarship Pageant. 

Pageant director Charity Pocock said that Hart's 
appearances on campus and in the community will be 
voluntary and will depend on her availability. 

Hart will also be traveling to compete in the Miss 
Indiana Pageant in an attempt to qualify for the Miss 
America Pageant. 

At the pageant, Tonya Cooper, Miss IPFW 2005. 
gave advice to Hart on what she should remember 
throughout her experience. 

"It's not about you. It's about how you can use the 
crown to make an impact," said Cooper. "It's about 
the life lessons you will learn."

Candidates' 
Views on Issues 

■ Panel raises awareness 
one last time before 
election day 

By Tanner Guthrie 



President Bush has made sonic no- 
ticeable changes to his stance on the 
current battle for control in Iraq and 
many speculate these nuRlilii.iiii.iiis 
have been driven by the upcoming 

"It is about timing. 25 percent 
of voters are swayed in the last two 
weeks," stated Andy Downs, who was 
one of five participants in a recent pan- 
el discussion. 

The event was held on Friday, Oct. 
20, at 1 1:00 a.m. in the Gates Sports 
Center with Vice Chancellor for Aca- 
demic Affairs Susan Hannah acting as 
moderator. 

Accompanying Downs in the well- 
attended debate of the upcoming elec- 
tion were Elliot Bartky, Geralyn Miller, 
and Mike Wolf. 

The discussion started with Wolf 
offering a vast amount of information 
centered around the country's various 

Wolf proclaimed, "Mid-term elec- 
tions generally gel less publicity, which 
in turn leads to lower voter turnout " 

Wolf pointed mil thai the President's 
party lost an average of 19 seats in mid- 
term elections between the years 1938 
and 1994. 

He also noted that presidents with 
an approval rating below 50 percent 
have seen their party lose an average 
of 43 seats. 

"In this election, die Democrats 
have done a betler job of finding a can- 
didate to run against the incumbents 
currently in office and things look good 
for them because of that," said Wolf. 

Wolf believes that this could be the 
first good opportunity for the Demo- 
cratic Party to lake over the House and 
gain control since 1994. 

He used an interactive map of the 
U.S. from the New York Times' Web 
site to illustrate the states that could 
potentially have a Democrat beat out a 
Republican. 

When Wolf finished his portion of 
the discussion, he turned the door over 
to Miller, who began explaining llie 
importance the President could play in 
this election. 

"President Bush has a lot of cam- 
paigning power and has the resources 
to sway voters in favor of his party. 

state that the President and the First 
Lady have been visiting to raise money 
and help their party," said Miller. 

Miller feels that President Bush 
could have a serious impact on certain 
races and focused most of her discus- 
sion on the power the President has 
when it comes to working a campaign. 

Andy Downs, who rccenUy moder- 
ated a debate between the three local 
candidates for sheriff, discussed the 
area's local elections. 

"The sheriff race in Allen County 
is bringing in a lot of money and re- 
sources primarily between the Repub- 
lican and Democratic candidates They 
have amassed impressive amounts of 
media coverage and even had a debate 
aired on TV," Downs said. 

"It is a popular race this year. But 
historically, the Republican has the up- 
per hand." 

Bartky was the panel discussion's 
final speaker.

Pondering the Purpose 
of Our Planet 



Between wriling term papers, 
studying for tests and deciding wheth- 
er or not to go to class, have you ever 
stopped to ask yourself what your view 
of the purpose of our planet might be? 

Perhaps you have stopped to con- 
template the Earth's origins or the 
countless ways in which Earth is the 
only known planet in our galaxy that 
allows for complex life. 

Possibly not. Well, campus minis- 
ter Tony Feiger has dared to contem- 
plate this question and lias proposed a 
theory based on the concept of intelli- 
gent design. 

This theory states that (he best ex- 
planation for the phenomenon of life is 
intelligent design as opposed to natu- 

This theory is considered a big 
tent theory and has been embraced 
by many people of different religions, 
backgrounds, races and cultures. 

Feiger, working alongside Campus 



Ministry, Campus Crusade for Life, as 
well as the C.S. Lewis Society, showed 
the film "The Privileged Planet" last 
Friday night in the Classroom Medical 
Building. 

The viewing was open to anyone 
interested in learning about this theory, 
which was based upon the concept of 
the involvement of intelligent design 
in creating habitable places in the uni- 

Although only three people came 
to the viewing of the film, Feiger re- 
mains hopeful that more people will 
explore this theory. 

It is a great opportunity for students 
to leam more about this topic because 
we have great speakers and they don't 
teach this perspective in classes. 

Feiger has studied this concept for 
a year; however, he does not claim to 
be an expert. 

When asked why he embraces this 
particular theory, Feiger says "It makes 
sense to me. The group is discussion- 
oriented and docs not preach only one 
side. Also, the meetings try to keep 



religmn m [ur.ik fro in science." 

Feiger loves a good argument .mil 
appreciates every individual's thought 
and suggestions. He encourages stu- 
dents to come Nov, 10 to hear Dr. Jay 
Wilde speak on the concepts of intel- 
ligent design. fliers will he posted tor

This argument intrigued me. Can a

Itcanif you happen lobe the target lhe\ use t

Age Should Not Deter 
Young Voters From 
Making Informed Decisions 



By Stephanie Sample; 






The other day. I was talking lo an- 
other Student who happened lo be old 
enough lo he my mother. We were dis- 
cussing (he upcoming elections and 
whal we knew aboul the candidates. 
After I had shared my opinions, her re- 
sponse was "you don't know anything 
about politics you are just a baby." 

With my Iwcnly-lirst birthday just 
around Ihc corner. I don'l consider m\ - 
self a baby. Yel. I don't think I know as 
much as someone twice my age. 

Wilh age comes life e\ per ience. and 
this is something I realize. I explained 
thai although I may he much younger, 
that doesn't mean I am uneducated. I 
also explained that I'm heller informed 
than plenty of people her age and older. 
This fellow student then responded by 
saying "they shouldn't give babies hal- 

This comment really got me dunk- 
ing. We are allowed to drive at sixteen. 
At eighteen, wc arc allowed to smoke, 
buy explicit materials, and-mosl im- 
ponantly-vote. Then, three years later, 
we are allowed to drink. 

This order, when written down, 
seems somewhat odd. We are trusted 
wilh the future of our country before 
we are trusted with a can of beer? 

It seems to me as though voting is 
not faken as seriously as it should be 

1 am glad that 1 am allowed lo vote, 
hui many take Ihc privilege lor grant- 
ed. Some say you should have lo meet 
certain requirements to vote: however. 
I believe ihal everyone deserves a say. 
My tpicstion is ibis: is eicliteen old 
enough to vole? 



ICS, while others, 
at this point, think a pimple will ruin 
Iheir life. Al this stage of life, this age 
group's experiences can vary consider- 
ably. How can we judge who is ready 
to vote, and will the ones who are ready 
participate? 

I think ii is very important to vote. 
At eighteen, I voled in Ihe 2004 presi- 
dential elections. I fell lhai I had an 
understanding of whom and for what I 
was voting. Now, a few years later. I 
may or may not have voted differently 
My choices would not have changed 
because of age, bul perhaps because of 
experience. 

This conversation made me realize 
thai I should tone it down every once 
in awhile and listen lo someone a little 
older. However. 1 also had another 
thought. Even though I am young. I 
ani informed. Just because someone is 
older docs no! mean they know more. 
In ihis upcoming election, there is a 
lot to leam from many different peo- 
ple. The Republicans could get some 
advice from the Democrats, and vice 
versa. Men and women could listen lo 
each other, and the young and old have 

Some of us in our youth think those 
who are older than us are out of touch. 
Older adults feel as though those who 
arc younger haven't lived enough. 
Maybe the best alternative would be to 
meet somewhere in Ihe middle. 

Maybe eighlcen is loo young, may- 
be not. If you arc old enough to vote 
and you lake Ihe opportunity lo do so, 
use Ihis time to prove others wrong. 
Make an informed decision-whatever 
ihal may be-and stand and by it. If oth- 
ers disagree with you, that is fine-tiiis 
is a free country and we are allowed to 
do so.

'Saw 3': 
Final Piece to 
Jigsaw's Puzzle 

By Mike Webb 

multiple lornts ilu -&gt;c i 
days. There are 
(hose thai make us jump 
several times during the 
experience and are more shocking™ 
than anything else. There are I he ones that make 
us squirm out of our seats due to the discomfort- 
ing leelings whieh they evoke. 

Finally, there are the films that get under our 
skin and make it crawl. 

The latter are the ones to watch out for, as 
they will have us afraid to look out our windows 
for fear.ot what may he looking back in. 

For that reason, it will come as a blessing to 
some to know that Lionsgate : 
lures" "Saw 3" falls entirely int 
the first two. It will make you 
able, but you won't ti 
with you when you leu 

Anyone who has seen the first two "Saw" 
movies knows exactly what to expect here. 
There is a madman on the loose who calls him- 
self Jigsaw (Tobin Bell). His claim to fame is 
that lie toys with his vie tints... literally. 

Jigsaw uses elaborately built contraptions to 
kill his victims if they do not follow the rules of 
his "games." If they do play by his rules, they 
will live, but will he forever changed iprnbably 
as a result of the trauma they went through-but 
Jigsaw doesn't sec things that way). 

Jigsaw is terminally ill. and he despises mur- 
derers. In a sense, if the victims die. it is because 
they basically killed themselves by not follow- 
ing the rules (but trust me. you wouldn't want to 
follow his rules either). 

The premise of (his movie is simple: a young 
doctor with a crumbling home life finds herself 
wrapped up in Jigsaw's latest game. 

With a collar around her neck linked to the 
ailing Jigsaw s heart rate and programmed to ex- 
plode if his heart slops, she miisi keep him alive 
at all costs.

He will eventually come face to face with

hit and run accident ju&lt;\ he must chouse if they 
live or die. 

If he can make it through the course in (wo 
hours, he lives. Urn if Jigsaw dies before then, so 
does our young doctor friend. 

Though (he premise sounds somewhat 
hokey (and is to an extent), it is very emotion- 
ally-driven. We will come face (o face with be- 
trayal, jealousy the meaning and value ol life, 
and I he concept i if excruciating pain t physically 
and emotionally). One c'an't 

help but wonder whether or not the blood and 
gore is here to mask the fact that this movie has 
a hidden agenda behind it and is trying lo tell us 
something about life. 

This formula has already led us through two 
"Saw" movies, which should really be seen first 
if this one is to be viewed as intended. 

There are several flashbacks which tie to- 
gether the loose ends of the first two movies 
and show us what happened to our former pro- 
tagonists. These flashbacks also explain how 
Jigsaw's menially -unstable sidekick Amanda 
(Shawnee Smith) came lo be in the picture.

star of "Saw 2." Eric Matthews (played by Don-

"You may not always ' ,.\\ when il is Octo- 
ber, but you certainly kno hen- ii is Oktobcc- 
fest," Conductor Tchivzhcl said, quoting a friend. 

Saturday night's Philhai ionic concert 'Clas- 
sic Oktoberfcsl was a delightful coneoclion nf 
German works, including Bath's "Suite No. 1 in 
D major." Brahms' ' I lebcslieder Waltzes" and 
Beethoven's "Symphony No. K in F major." 

lhat this suite, one of four Bach completed, was 
probably written between 1725 and 1740 while 
Ihe composer was in Leipzig. At this time, Bach 
was composing musie lor four churches, direct- 
ing all their choirs and directing the collegium's 
musicum, u choir ol prntcsMun.il musicians and 
college students. In short, Bach was busy. 

Bui he must have been organized. The flurry 
of racing pans in the first movement of Ihe suite 
sounded malhematically-pcrfect as the violin 
notes dashed in and around tho^e of the rest of the 

Lisleners simply relaxed and enjoyed the 
rhythmic perfection of a great composer The 
second movement was the familiar "Air on ihe G 
String." 

This movement was performed with beauti- 
fully-modulated opening chords, sending an aura 
of perfect peace throughout the auditorium Ab- 
solute silence soaked in the l.isi notes of "Air" as 
the orehesira melted into the lin.i] chords A lively 
gavotte followed, with trumpets taking the lead- 



This movement is the familiar Bach gavotte 
(hat many Suzuki violin students learn in the early 
part of their training. The many repeated sec i ions
