00 library books 
moved Sept. 20 



Prepare for 'Book Walk' 

Librarian WiUard D, Hunsberger and Assistant Librarian 
Roger Miller prepare for the September 20 Book Walk, 
An estimated 100,000 books will be carried from the old 
library to the new library learning center. 



September 20. 1972 will be 
a memorable day In the 
history of the Indiana-Pur- 
due Library. On that day, 
100,000 books from the old, 
one-room library In the 
Main Educational Building 
will be literally walked to 
the new library learning 
center. The new center is 
located north of Building 
A, near the Student Union 
Building, which is now 
under construction. 

Assistant Librarian 
Roger Miller, who has as- 
sisted In numerous book 
walks in the past. Is In 
charge of the I-P Book 
Walk, Describing the rea- 
son behind having the Book 
Walk here. Miller said, 
"We will save time because 



the books will not be pack- 
ed In boxes or on book 
trucks. Methods other than 
the Book Walk would take 
from one to three weeks. 
PrefesBlonal movers would 
cost from $5,000 to$IO,000 
so we also save money," 

The library staff Is ap- 
pealing to individual stu- 
dents and student organi- 
zations for assistance In 
the Book Walk, I-P alumni, 
faculty wives, and comm- 
unity groups such as 4-H 
and boy and girl scouts 
will also help carry books. 

If good weather prevails, 
the Book Walk will begin 
Wednesday, September 20, 
at 8 a.m. and will con- 
tinue until the job is fin- 
ished, probably around 
1 ^^^11 ^

Nixon signs emergency 
legislation for loans 

The President has signed emergency legislation affecting 
the Guaranteed Student Loan Program. In essence, 
this action means that the rules governing the program 
before July 1, 1972, are again In effect. 

Briefly, the program now enables a student to borrow 
up to $1,500 per academic year for educational expenses. 
If the student's "adjusted 



"Dames at Sea" 
reopens tonight 



family Income" Is less than 
$15,000, the Federal Gov- 
ernment will pay the inter- 
est until the principal Is 
due for repayment— be- 
tween 9 and 12 months after 
the student leaves school 
or graduates. 

The loans are available 
to students attending 
colleges and universities 
and vocational schools.

State or private nonprofit 
agency or Insured by the 
Federal Government. 

The Education Amend- 
ments of 1972, which be- 
came effective July 1, 1972, 
called for an analysis of 
the student's need for a 
loan by his educational In- 
stitution, This require- 
ment is eliminated by the 
emergency legislation. 

However, a notarized af- 
fidavit (Section A of OE 
form 1260), stating that 
the loan will be used only 
for educational purposes, 
is still required. Sections 
B and C of the form are 
to be completely dis- 
regarded. 

Loans made between July 
and August 18, wheninterim 
regulations applied, will be 
honored. However, stu- 
dents who received loans 
during that period may con- 
sult their lenders If they 
feel that an additional 
amount is necessary to 
meet educational cqsts.

Nursing department 
receives large grant 



A grant that amounts to 
$41,192 has been assigned Co 
Che nursing department ac 
has been asslgnea to tne 
I-PU nursing department at 
the Fort Wayne Campus by 
the U.S. Department of 
Health, Education, and 
Welfare. Notice of the grant 
came from Jesse M. Scott, 
Assistant Surgeon General 
and Director of the Divi- 
sion of Nursing for HEW. 

P.U, Dean and Director 
Roger J. Manges noted that 
participation in the Capita- 
tion Grant Program wlU 
provide the funds for addi- 
tional nursing faculty and 
for more equipment and 
audiovisual materials used 
in classroom and labor- 
atory studies. 

"We are particularly in- 
debted to Prof. Doris 0. 
Mack, chairman of our nur- 
sing department here, for 
compiling the facts and 
statistics necessary to the 



successful filing of our 
application for these 
funds," Dr. Manges said. 



The two-year associate 
degree in nursing (leading 
to the R.N.) was originated 
in 1964. 

Plans have been under way 
for some time to develop 
a four-year baccalaureate 
nursing program and will 
be effected upon approval 
of the Board of Trustees 
and the Indiana Commis- 
sion for Higher Education. 
Purpose of the liaccalaure- 
ate degree is to provide an 
opportunity for the tech- 
nical nurse to advance to 
the professional nurse 
level. The degree allows 
for greater career mobility 
and also, where desired, 
prepares nurses for con- 
tinuation toward masters 
and higher degree cur- 
ricula. - 



The Internal Affairs Com- 
mittee will be headed by 
John Perkins, a mathema- 
tics major. A graduate of 
Leo High School, he has 
regularly made the Dean's 
List. 

This committee will be 
responsible for a number 
of miscellaneous govern- 
ment affairs. Committee 
members are Cheryl 
Napier, Humberto Trol- 
tlno, and Jane Prochnow 
Nusbaumer. "

COMMUNITY NEWS; 
A COMMENTARY 



by Stan Jones 



County Council debates budget 

The County Council began debate Tuesday on the 1973 
budget. The budget request of the different agencies and 
departments was the largest ever totaling over $30 mil- 
lion. The Increase over last year was in excess of 10 
per cent with the largest In the area of welfare from $9.59 
million to $11.29 million. Other areas with large Increas- 
es were: Highway Department, $2.23 million to $2.27 
million; Planning Commission, $89 thousand to $123 thou- 
sand. Treasurer, $127 thousand to $244 thousand, printing 
fees from $16 thousand to $36.9 thousand. Request re- 
duction occured in Voters Registration, Election Board, 
and Parks. 

Affen County birth rate down 

The cry of the alarmist about over population may turn 
into a whisper If birth rates continue as they have for the 
past few years. In Allen County alone there were 300 less 
births In the first six months of this year as there were 
In same period last year. Also, nationally birthrates have 
been declining steadily since the, middle of the 1960's. If 
projected figures prove our, a zero population growth 
rate will be reached long before 1980. With this decline 
of predominatly the so-called unwanted child we face the 
question of what to do for those couples who want to adopt, 
but can find no child. 



Housing ordinance stopped 



As the City Council voted down the minimum housing 
ordinance out cries of alarm were heard from many of 
the cities citizens. Many advocates of the bill claim ex- 
ploitation of the poor by the "shifty experienced" slum 
lord who cares only for the buck. 

$90,000 buys Garbo's old car 

$90,000 for one car? Apparently someone felt one car 
was worth It, as Charles Wood of LakeGeorge, New York, 
bid that much on a 1933 Duesenberg, reportedly once owned 
by actress Greta Garbo. The antique car auction this past 
weekend In Auburn drew in excess of 10,000 spectators 
who watched as over $850,000 of automobiles were sold. 
This auction, the first held last year, has gained such 
renown that bidders and spectators from as far away as 
California, Florida and Connecticut were on hand. Most 
probably, a $90,000 bid will not take top honors next year. 

Bank reports little success in program 

The Issue of the environment maybe Important for many 
bu: not a substantial concern if Fort Wayne National Bank' s 
Ecology Savings Bond Program Is any Indicator. In Its 
over 18 months of operation, only a little more than 
$200,000 has been Invested. Only one major firm in 
the area has made use of Its assets and low Interest 
rates. This, however, does not change FWNB policy 
to provide up to $2.5 million for environmental quality 
projects. So, the responsibility seems to rest on both 
Investors and borrowers to make use of the program.

Karate course introduced on campus 



By Doug Wylle 
One of the many Indiana 
University Continuing Edu- 
cation and Special Univer- 
sity Programs presented 
this fall will be the art 
of karate. 

The course In beginning 
Karate and selfdefense will 
be taught by Mr. Robert 
Bowles, an Okinawa stylist 
and third degree black belt 
Karate Instructor and a 
member of the United 
States Karate Association. 
Bowles is now a resident 
of Fort Wayne and Chief 
Instructor and Manager of 
the Bowles Karate Aca- 
demy of 2721 South Calhoun 
Street. 

He halls from Phoenix, 
Arizona where he began ' 
studying Karate in 1964 
under a man named Robert 
A. Trias, founder and dir- 
ector of the United States 
Karate Association. Trias 
also brought Karate to the 
United States In 1948 after 
he recieved the rank of 
Sho-dan (first degree black 
belt) following his studying 
of Shorel and Slng-yl 
Karate under Master Tong 
Gee Sing, a Chinese 
Buddhist missionary seek- 
ing conversion of the 
British Solomah " Island 
natives during the time of 
World War Two, 

From his headquarters 
at the Trias International 
Institute of Karate In Phoe- 
nix, Arizona, Trias, a 
ninth degree blackbelt and 
the recognized .father of 
American Karate, directs 
the United States Karate 
Association with over 
100,000 affiliated members 
around the globe. 

Bowles, who has won num- 
erous national and regional 
championships, toured Eu- 
rope this summer as a 
member of a four man 
American goodwill team, 
competing and exchanging 
Karate knowledge with the 
various European national 
champions. 

The course, Beginning 
Karate will begin Septem- 
ber 12 from 7:30-9:30 p.m. 
at Indiana-Purdue. Bowles 
will teach th&amp; origin and 
development of Karate 
throughout the world along 
with basic Karate tech- 
mlques such as kicking, 
punching and defending In 
all directions as well as 
self defense techniques 
against an attacker on the 
street. He will utilize 
various chokes, throws., 
arm locks, chopping, 
slashing and gouging tech- 
niques. 

Karate Is the ultimate of 
unarmed self-defense. The 
word Karate literally 
means empty hands, Kara 
(empty) te (hand). 
SPORT KARATE 

Modern day Karate has 
come Into prominence as 



a sport. Karate's original 
form is an extremely effec- 
tive method of self- 
defense. Average students 
learn Karate for self-de- 
fense and physical condi- 
tioning. 

As the student becomes 
proficient he is taught to 
apply Karate knowledge by 
sparring with fellow stud- 
ents. Sparring (kumlte) is 
a vital part of the train- 
ing used In most systems 
of today. Contests among 
students of the various 
styles are musnroomlng 
throughout the country. 
Such contests properly 
conducted afford the Karate 
students opportunity to test 
their sparring abilities 
with knowledge learned in 
Karate school. 

Competition has neclssl- 
tated the adoption of strict 
regulations and supervis- 
ion, thus making It possible 
for Karate to become one 
of the most competitive 
and exciting sports In the 
United States. 

For those who practice 
Karate as a way of life 
it becomes more than a 
method of fighting and 
physical fitness. There are 
mental rewards such as 
self-confidence, pride and 
patience. A new state of 
self-confidence and peace 
of mind begins to form The 
need to be a bully or over- 
bearing Is lost to the feeling 
of self-confidence. 



Pride in self overcomes 
a desperate need to prove 
one's individual worth. 
Patience and Inner peace 
are found In training a- ' 

performance of the art. 
Karate therefore becomes 
a basic part of existence. 
Fear and anger are re- 
placed with tranquility. As 
with those who believe in 
the non-violent creed, kar- 
ate teaches an Inner peace. 
Just how does karate 
achieve these goals. There 
are two ways of attaining 
true mental control. 

One is through faith, 
whether It be In a supreme 
being or in a philosophy.' 
To know oneself Is the 
second method. Karate en- 
ables one to have a more 
conprehensive under- 

standing of self and pre- 
sents a philosophy in which 
to believe. Thus the 
psychological principles of 
karate strengthen and pro- 
mote growth and under- 
standing in the individual. 

Knowledge of the Art of 
Karate is an effective 
means of self protection 
in a volitltle society of 
crime and unrest. Call 
219-483-8121 Ext 274 at the 
Regional Campus or Roben 
Bowles at 456-7788 for fur- 
ther Information and en- 
rollment, or contact the 
Indiana University at Port 
Wayne Office of Continuing 
education and Special Un- 
iversity Programs.

Edftoriallq 
Speaking 



Academic ^rievances-l 



What is the system? 



At present both Institu- 
tion on thlB campus offer 
continuing education pro- 
grams. Continuing ed, is 
the college version of high 
school night classes for 
adults. 

The purpose of continuing 
ed. stated by both insti- 
tutions is to make avail- 
able university resources 
to the general public. Tax- _ 
payers find a usefulness 
In their tax dollars if they 
personally benefit from 
tax-supported services. 

Both Institutions draw 
from the same resources 
to sponsor their programs. 
Why does there need to be 
two separate programs? 

Programs d rawing from 
the same resource pool 

The Dual Unhrenitv 



find themselves competing 
for attention in the comm- 
unity. 

To administer two sepa- 
rate programs requires 
two separate administra- 
tive staffs, a questionable 
expenditure when academic 
programs are cut back for 
lack of funds. 

Finally, theldentityof this 
university Is further cloud- 
ed as the public is forced 
to think In terms of two 
separate universities. 

Back in 1966 a comm- 
unity service mission was 
determined. As best we see 
it, continuing ed. falls 
under this mission. 

The two offices should be 
merge now, before the 
spring acneaules are fin- 
alized. 



Two continuing eds? 



What recourse do students 
have on academic matters? 
Is there an established pro- 
cedure for voicing academ- 
ic grievances? 

Nearly every student on 
campus has felt he has not 
been treated fairly at one 
time or another. Usually 
his complaint is un- 
justified. 

But there are many com- 
plaints that are Justified. 
These students are advised 
that they need merely fol- 
low the established pro- 
cedure to right the wrong. 

First, one speaks to his 
professor. All but a few 
grievances are, and should 
be, alleviated at this point. 
However, the subject at 
hand Is those few that need 
be taken beyond the first 
point. 

. If the student does not 
think he has received a fair 
hearing, he sees the de- 
partment chairman. Inevit- 



ably, the department chair- 
man defends his professor. 
The student must go still 
higher to obtain justice. 

The school chairman, if 
there Is one, or the ac- 
ademic dean is next in line. 
By now the student must 
face the full force of an en- 
trenched, self-perpetuat- 
Ing system. 

Teaching, especially at 
the university level. Is a 
profession; hence, ithe 
"professionals" defend 
each other to the death. 

If a student's grlevancels 
not satisfied by his pro- 
fessor. It more than likely 
will never be satisfied. 

Fortunately. 95% of all 
grievances never leave the 
professor level. The other 
five percent find them- 
selves in a system that will 
not tolerate dissent from 
below. 

Nextweek; A case In point. 



Opinions expressed in the Editorially Speaking column 
are those of the editorial staff of this paper. We recog- 
nize the responsibility of having to print differing opinions. 



Henson urges support 

To the Editor: 

College is more than just 
attending classes. As stu- 
dents we have spent a great 
deal of time In the Library 
studying, looking up mat- 
erial for research papers 
and term papers. We, the 
student body have been 
asked to participate In 
moving the library from Its 
present location In the Edu- 
cation Building to the newly 
completed Library Build- 
ing, between the Academic 

Building and what will be 
the Student Union BUUdftlff.' 



of 'Book Walk' 

I see' this as a chance 
for each and every student 
attending this campus to 
show the Fort Wayne Com- 
munity that we truly are 
very proud to be students 
of Indiana-Purdue Uni- 
versity. Also, I see it 
as a chance for each stu- 
dent to make this library 
his library. 

I will be doing my part 
along with the rest of the 
Students' Government. 

Hope to see all of you on 
September 20.

"As I've outlined in the syllabus, there will be 
three exams this semester. ..as you may know, I grade 
on a 1000;E scale. , ." 



Now that another sem- 
ester Is underway and 
"Ofthogon" is being 

printed again, perhaps it 
Is time to reveal to those 
of you who have asked or 
wondered what this name 
means to me. I would 
also like to take the time 
to explain what it means 
to my pet goldfish, but that 
Is something that might 
be taken up at a later, 
more appropriate time. I 
realize that some of you 
may not care what the name 
means, and some of 
you may not understand 
what I have said once I 
carefully explain it, but for 
the rest of you it probably 
Isn't a matter of much 
importance anyway, so 1 
shall go on. 

An orthogonal projection 
is a two dimensional draw- 
ing of a three dimensional 
object. My views are 
rather like that. They are 
not conceptualized along 
bl-polar lines. I am "not 
a liberal nor a conserva- 
tive; I am not a leftist 
nor a rlghtistj^ but I am 
certainly nq^ a ml ddle-ot- 
the reader So, what's 
left? A third dimension^ 
of course, and I express 
my views through the two 
dimensional medium of 
language. Ergo: Orthogon, 
We experience life in sim- 
ultaneity; that is, we exper- 
ience many things sim- 
ultaneously and filter the 
important things according 
to our value system and 
needs of the moment. It 
1 8 the only way that we 
can function in this super- 
abundance of stimuli clam- 
oring for our attention 
When we start trying to 



process the information to 
which we have decided to 
devote our attention, we 
must arrange It In sequen- 
tial form — witness the 
common sayings, "first 
things first," and "one 
thing at a time, please!" 
Oftentimes we are tempted 
to assume that life is lived 
according to the way that 
we process our Infor- 
mation, and this often leads 
us into one of the most 
subtle traps of our infor- 
mation saturated culture: 
that of accepting the word 
as the fact. 

Such traps can and do 
easily lead us Into judging 
people by the labels pinned 
on them by others or from 
a -limited number of 
contracts with such people. 
We find ourselves more 
readily accepting the word

of a Ph. D. rather than 
trying to understand the 
experiences of the indi- 
genous resident when con- 
sidering the problems of 
minorities. We actually 
expect an answer when we 
ask, "What do 'they' 
want?" 

Because I would like to 
avoid such pitfalls, I try 
to express ideas In thlscol- 
umn which are of general 
and current Interest, but I 
try to do so from various 
perspectives. 

The main purpose of this 
column, then. If there is 
one at all is to try and 
revive that ancient and al- 
most lost art: that of crit- 
ical thinking. The point 
is to accept nothing at 
all at face value, Including 
this article.

Counseling for freshmen to improve 



An interview with Dr. John P. Ulmer, Associate Dean of Student Services 



Q; Dean Ulmer. what chan- 
ges have taken place in the 
area of counseling? 
A: We have taken the Uni- 
versity Division organiza- 
tion or structure whlchhas 
existed for years In the Ind- 
iana University system, and 



have modified that system 
to make Ic applicable to bo- 
th universities. The Uni- 
versity Division, effective 
July 1. 1972, was renamed 
the Academic Development 
and Counseling Division. 
The services of this divi- 



sion will be made indiscri- 
minately available to both 
lU and PU students. The 
services are these essent- 
ially: If a student enters ei- 
ther universltyandhelsnot 
certain of his broad educa- 
tional goal or specific ma- 



faculty In the imparting of 
career insight information. 
Q. Then the student will 
receive both academic and 
career oriented counsel- 
ing? 



A: Right. By definition the 




Dean Ulmer plans his weekly schedule of appointments

jor, he may enter the Aca- 
demic Development and 
Counseling Division di- 
rectly from the Admissions 
office. This division will 
serve as a kind of "hold- 
ing" divisional home for 
him during which time he 
can avail himself of coun- 
seling and/or testing ser- 
vices which win help as- 
sist him In finding hispar- 
tlcular educational goal. 
When this occurs, he will 
be certified to an upper 
academic division. 

Entering Indiana and Pur- 
due students who declare a 
major or specific field will 
be admitted directly to the 
division or school of their 
choice. 

Additionally, we are going 
to try to do more in the ar- 
ea of giving students 
Information about current 
and future career and em- 
ployment opportunities. 
Students must always have 
the complete freedom to 
make up their minds as to 
their educational -career 
goals however, we feel they 
should be given career in- 
formation early in their 
college years to assist 
them In making these de- 
cisions. In addition to voca- 
tional and educational test- 
ing, we plan to develop 
more career kinds of lit- 
erature for students. We 
also hope to involve com- 
murdty resource people and 



102 in the Main Educational 

division will reallyprovide 
counseling in many differ- 
ent areas. In addition to 
c a r e e r-educatlonal coun- 
s e 1 1 n g. there will be the 
personal-emotional and so 
clal adjustment counseling 
for the entire student body 
and academic course se- 
lection for students In the 
Academic Development and 
Counseling Division. 

Q: .Will Indiana students be 
able to be admitted directly 
to their major? Andean 
Purdue students be admit- 
ted as undecided? 
A: That's right. As of this 
fall we will be admitting 
Indiana students directlyto 
the division or school of 
their choice as Purdue has 
previously done. 

Dr. Craig and Mrs. Bran- 
dt, counselors in the ADCD 
win be sending letters in the 
near future to Indiana and 
Purdue non-degree or tem- 
porary students, and to 
those with undecided maj- 
ors Informing them of the 
Academic Development and 
Counseling Division 
services available to them. 

Q: What other services will 
be provided by the ACDC? 
A: Theplacementofflcehas 
been renamed the Career 
Development and Place- 
ment Center and adminis- 
tratively assigned to the 
Academic Development and- 



Counseling Division. Mr. 
Heller, who Is the newly 
appointed full-time coor- 
dinator of this office will 
be involved in developing 
career Information for stu- 
dents, in addition, he will 
be serving in the traditional 
sense as the campus Place- 
ment Officer. 

Mr. Chavis ts enlarging 
and expanding our special 
services program which, 
very briefly, is providing 
services for students who, 
In many cases, have been 
out of school for a number 
of years and may be In. 
need of some specialized 
supportive counseling and 
tutorial, developmental 
skills services. 

Ways and means of best 
providing these kinds of 
services are presently 
being considered by Mr. 
Chavis. 

Q: Moving away from the 
acdc, has there been 
changes made In Student 
Activities or Athletics? 
A; No, basically not. His- 
torically on this campus 
the athletics and the stu- 
dent activities functions 
have been combined or 
unified. 

Q: Has Financial Aids 
changed? 

A: Yes, financial aids, es- 
sentially Is functioning this 
year as It has In the past. 
While we operate one 
office, we service both un- 
iversities in terms of fin- 
ancial aids. We hope that 
In the foreseeable future we 
will be able to make a 
single request for federal 
financial aids monies. In 
the past, we've had to make 
separate requests for Ind- 
iana students and Purdue 
students, and maintain sep- 
arate accounting systems 
for both. Services to stu- 
dents will be greatly facil- 
itated by having a single 
system, 

Q: Are there plans to es- 
tablish an Office for Student 
Health Services? 
A: Thisofffce willbefunded 
and staffed beginning with 
the spring semester. While 
we have provided emer- 
gency first aid kinds of 
care, we've really not 
gotten Involved with health 
services per se, because 
we've not had the facility 
for it. The new Student 
Union will have a health 
center facility and we have 
employed a coordinator for 
health services, effective 
January, 1973. 

Q: But you have no plans 
to provide resident medical 
services on campus? 
A; Yes, It is not our intent 
to provide resident medical 
services on campus be- 
cause of the accessibility 
of local hospitals and 
family physicians. We do . 
need the kinds of services 
that can be given by a health 
counselor with consulting 
M,D. services from the 
community^

Rod Stewart's ^Never 
a Dull Moment' is 



Sooner or later. Rod Stew- 
art Is going to put out a 
really good album. This 
isn't the one. 

Never a Dull Moment Is 
disappointing — not because 
It's so bad, but because 
those who remember Rod 
from his days with Jeff 
Beck know he's capable of 
better. Actually, only about 
half of this album's tracks 
could be classified as aw- 
ful, and two or three are 
pretty good. 

Side one starts off with the 
best tune on the album, 
"True Blue", and goes 
downhill from there, de- 
generating into material 
like Bob Dylan's "Mama, 
You Been on my Mind" 
which even Dylan does bet- 
ter. The best thing to do 
with this side is play "True 
Blue" and hit the rejecr 
lever. 

Side two starts out on a 
hopeful note wlthJimiHen- 
tirix' "Angel" and Rod's 
current single "You Wear 
it Well" (which sounds 
strangely like Rod's "Mag- 



by Michael Snyder 

gie Mae" with the words 
changed.) At this point, un- 
fortunately, the album a- 
gain degenerates to third 
rate material and third- 
rate performance by Stew- 
art and Faces. "Twisting 
the Night Away," the last 
tune on the album could 
have been a high point, ex- 
cept the bass player spends 
the first half of the song 
figuring out his part. 

But then. Rod Stewart is 
a rock star, not an artist, 
and only artists have to put 
out great albums. Maybe 
one day Rod can be both. 



PIT'S 'Dames at Sea' 
is indescribably good 



Dropping in on a rehear-- 
sal of "Dames at Sea," 
1 ...tended to remain and 
watch a few scenes so that 
I could write some sort of 
an Introductory review 
prior to Friday night's 
opening. Like so many 
other good intentions, my 
plans went awry shortly af- 
ter I entered the PIT. 

Simply stated, there Is no 
way that I can do justice to 
"Dames at Sea" without 
seeing the whole product- 
ion. It's that good. The 
teaser that I had of the 
whole show only served to 
give me a frustrating cur- 
iosity and unchecked desire 
to see "Dames" in it'sen- 
tirety. There is so much to 
ray even about the small 
portion of the musical that 
I viewed that I don't know 
where or with what to begin. 
I could attempt to describe 
the actors, (Ihope they par- 
don for taking such liber- 
ties.) Even to my untrained 
eye, the acting was greati 
Rather than becoming en- 
tangled by a tendency to 
over-react to action which 
seems as if it could easily 
be overdone, the cast was 
admirably restralnedlnit's 
presentation. Emphasis 
was on the elements of ex- 
aggeration - as opposed to 
elements of slapstick which 
could quickly have beenln- 
cluded.The apparent ex- 
citement which pervaded 
the cast as it went about Its 
work is amazing afterwhat 
must be hours of arduous 
practice. Cast members 
may be non-professionals, 
but if they are amateurs 
they certainly do an excell- 
ent job of hiding this fact 
from the audience. Had I 
not known otherwise, I 
would' ve suspected that 
they had all just stepped off 
of a Broadway stage. 

However, enough said 
about the actors. It's too 
impossible of a task to put 
them into words anyhow. 
Perhaps I should consider 
other aspects of i!he play. 
Like the flawless use made 



by Liz Schevtchuk 
of the tiny FIT stage for 
a setting reminiscent of the 
gala spectaculars of 
the '30's. Or the rolling 
magic of the melodies pro- 
duced by nothing more than 
a handful of people and a 
single piano. Or the way the 
spirited atmosphere of 
"Dames" surroundsthe 
audience (or. In my case, 
the spectator) and refuses 
to relax Its hold long after 
the theatre has been vaca- 
ted. 

But efforts to convey such 
impressions on paper 
somehow aren't sufficient. 
There Is really no way to 
describe "Dames"It's not 
just an object of art. It's 
an experience. See It 'or 
yourself, '-^

Black September hits the Games 



The Summer Olympics in 
Munich, West Germany, 
1972: the world is In all 
its glory as Russian ath- 
lete embrace victorious 
Americans, West Germans 
embrace victorous East 

Germans It is truly a 

magnificent sight that can- 
not possibly be ever for- 
gotten. And then: 

Munich (UPI) - The 20th 
Olympic Games were tem- 
porarily suspended today 
after an Arab vengence 
squad shot its way Into the 
Israeli quarters, of the 
Olympic Village, killed two 
Israeli men and seized nine 
Israeli hostages. 

Washington (UPI) - 
NKON: "With all nations 
and peoples around the 
world, we fervently hope 
that no further Innocent 
lives win be sacrifled. This 
assault on the Israeli 
Olympic Team Is offensive 
to men and women of good 
win everywhere for whom 
the Olympic games are a 
symlDol of man's striving 
for reconciliation and 
peace," 

Jim McKay, one of the 
ABC sports commentators 
covering the Games, seem- 
ed to me to be most repre- 
sentative of the U.S, feel- 
ing toward the Olympics. 
With a well of pride clear- 
ly present in his chirping 
voice, he covered the tre- 
mendous drama of the 
Games through Tuesday 
flawlessly. 

Baseball managers 

No less ttian seven mana- 
gers have gotten the ax In 
the majors this season, in- 
cluding Leo "The Lip" Du- 
rocher, who was dumped by 
the Cubs. But when Harry 
Wallcer got his walking pa- 
pers from Houston, guess 
who got the job? Leo just 
couldn't turn down the 40 

grand salary which will 

go nicely with his $22,000 
a year pension.

And it was Jim McKay 
who late Wednesday night 
told millions of viewers 
In a shattered voice all 
that was known at the time 
of the airport chapter of 
the shocking tragedy. 

Before the suspension of 
the Games, the Olympic 
spotlight was on Mark 
Spitz, who, of course, ac- 
complished what no man 
had ever done in wlnnlnp; 
seven ^old medals. But 
Shane Gould, the 15-year- 
old Australian fish, had a 
good chance of sharing that 
spotlight. She was after 
five golds, which would 
have been the top female 
feat ever In the Olympics. 
But twice she was stopped 
by American swimmers, 
and had to settle for three 
gold medals. 

It is Interesting to note 
that, of the first 60 U.S. 
medals won, 35 were from 
swimming competition. 
Through black Wednesday 
the United States led the 
other nations of the world 
in total medals with 71. 
The Soviet Union was se- 
cond with 63, but led Im 
golds 26 to 25 over the 
U.S, 

The U.S. basketball team 
was 7-0 thru Wednesday 
after having slaughtered 
Japan 99-33. The Russians 
also were 7-0 but not given 
much of a chance to top 
the Americans if and when 
the two would meet. Am-
