Debbie Kirkland is a pre- 
med biology student who regis- 
tered to vote during a Hot 107.9 
voter registration drive at IPFW. 
An 18-year-old freshman, this is 
the First time she will be voting. 

"I believe strongly that this 
is a crucial (election) and I 
believe that every vote does 
count, even though Indiana is a 
true Republican state, your vote 
may tip it," she said. 

Steve Cohen, a freshman 
in engineering, feels that voting 
is a responsibility-regardless of

going on in the country,

Breanna Stilwell, a fresh- 
man in radiography, agrees, 
though she doesn't see similar 
sentiments about voting 
amongst her friends. 

"Most kids are worried 
about their boyfriend or worried 
about school or they just feel like 
it's not important," she said. 

Kirkland said around 20 of 

friends have regi;

zations pushing youth to get reg- 
istered. 

One of those organisations, 
the University Democrats, par- 
ticipated in a voter drive at 
IPFW and helped register almost 
1000 voters. Scott Howard, its 
president, says that he sees a def- 
inite heightened interest in this 
year's election. 

Political panics and inde- 
pendent groups believe that new 
voters will turn out in droves this 
year, and they're likely to be 
young voters, according to a 
Gallup poll. Howard 




believes this is perhaps the most 
important election in 20 years, 
and that's why more students are 
ivijisk-ring to vote. 

"Do they (students) want 
to vote out of protest or do they 
want to vote to show confidence 
in this president," he says, ques- 
tioning not the motivation 
behind elevated student regislra- 
. lion, but rather.what their actual 
opinion is. 

"1 think it's the X-faclor," 
he says, "no side knows what's 
going to happen." 

Brock Graham, a freshman 
in theatre, says it's clear what's 
behind his and many of his 
friends' motivation to register. 

"1 do not want Bush in 
office for another four years," he 
said, adding that "a lot of my 
friends are liberal democrats. 
and whenever they see a Bush 
supporter, they tend to attack

Dental program 
celebrating its 
40th anniversary 



By Kelly Royal 

The Communicator _ 

From its humble begin- 
nings in the 1960s, to the devel- 
opment of the modem, well 
respected program it is today, 
the IPFW Dental Hygiene 
Program really has something 

This year denial hygiene 
students, staff and faculty are 
celebrating the program's 40th 
anniversary. 

Professor Elaine Foley, 
director of dental hygiene since 
1987, graduated from the pro- 
gram at IPFW in 1968. She now 
leaches there. 

"My favorite part of the 
day is time 1 spend with stu- 
dents. It's energizing to be 
around students thai are so 
enthusiastic," she said. 

The Denial Hygiene 
Program was first established at 
IPFW in September 1964. At 
the time only one dental 
hygiene program existed in 
Indiana and the growing 
demand for hygienists was not

authenticity of Bush's decision 
to invade Iraq, imputing the war 
lacked planning and has been 
mismanaged. 

IPFW student Darci Gaff, 
who is trying to reestablish a 
Republican group on the cam- 
pus, believes Bush is the right 
choice. 

"Our country really needs 
strong leadership right now. 
You have to look past political 
party. The war is the most 
important issue that we're fac- 
ing right now. He has the vision 
for the war," she said. 

Gaff admits she und her 
husband are a bit preoccupied 
with coverage of the election. 
There's a word for it. 

"Obsessed, We watch it, 

tiilk radio," she said.

describes himself as a "pro-war 
voter voting for an anti-war 
candidate." He does not feci 
conflicted though, because he 
docs not find a strong enough 
distinction between Bush or 
Kerry's policy on the war. 

"If you're in a red or blue 
slate you might us well vote 
your conscience rather than 
vote for the lesser of Iwo evils," 
Endcrs said, "unless one candi- 
date's policy is crucial to your 
lik- or well-being." 



"Our country really needs strong leader-

When speaking of issues 
that affect young citizens and

surrounding the actual Nov. 2 
election, many election experts 
have wondered whether the 
election results will be conclu- 
sive, or if the race may prove so 
close that either side could con-

If the outcome of the elec- 
tion is questioned, the polarity

Enders sees this as an

Wolf was chosen to be the

the University of Pretoria.

professor 



By Katie Pruitt 
The Communicator 



With the 2004 presiden- 
tial election less than a week 
away, it may be useful to 
examine the elected office 
each candidate used or is using 
as a springboard to the White 

Historical evidence does 
not indicate that Senator John 



Kerry's position as a U.S. 
Senator will support his bid for 
the presidency. In fact, 
President John F. Kennedy, 
inaugurated in 1961, was the 
most recent senator to be elect- 
ed to the White House. 

Before Kennedy, 

President Warren G. Harding, 
who came to the presidency in 
1921, was the last president to 
come to the office as a senator. 

The presidents between 
Kennedy and the current pres- 
ident, George W. Bush, have 
all been former governors and 

James Lutz, chair of the 
IPFW Political Science 
Department, observes that the 
United States' history overall 
includes more former gover- 



"It actually is not a recent 
phenomenon," he said. 

"The best guess is that 
governors are able to argue 
that they have experience in 
the executive branch," he 
added, noting that senators' 
immediate experience is limit- 
ed to the legislative branch of 
the government. 

This trend of electing 



governors to the 



high- 



t office can also be attributed 
to public conception of 
Washington, D.C. as a corrupt

Corporate monkeys do not benefit 
workers, create no viable product 



Since you are all probably 
tired of reading columns about 
voting by now (It'll be over 
soon. 1 promise), [ figured that I 
would talk about something 

Last week, I went to a 
training class at Parkview 
Hospital, where I work as a 
telecommunications operator 
(which is a glorified term for 
"switchboard operator." or 
"phone jockey"). 

The lecture was called 
"New Realities," and was 
developed by this guy, Karl 



Newspeak (a.k.a. meaningless 
corporate lingo), "How to Make 
CHANGE Your Competitive 
Advantage" 

The lecture was full of 
what my editor refers to as 
"masturbation." The only pur- 
pose it serves is making its cor- 
porate officers feel good. 

Usually 



about dedication ceremonies, porate bigwigs love him: "So 

ribbon-cuttings and any other you say you can guilt our peo- 

pseudo-events that really serve pie into not questioning 

no purpose to anyone else but changes we make in policy?"

Professors and their

Many IPFW professors use their office doors and wall-spaces 
as a forum to express their political beliefs. Students often post 
their own comment in response. ummIH conflicting with the views 
of the professor. Should professors leave the responses posted to 
preserve an open political dialogue? Or should they take the post-

sity should be a place where 
faculty, students, staff and 

speech, welcome controversy 
and encourage different points 
of view. 



Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11" 
reveals that some folks haven't 
figured this out. 

Don't like Michael 
Moore? Fine, don't see the 
film. The Communicator has 
asked whether or not students 
should be allowed to respond to 
professors' political 



dents need a place where they 
can vent some steam — unedited 

and unregulated. But profes- 



sors' doors are out of bounds, if 
not just for the fact that some 
students' responses have been 
entirely inappropriate, 

A poster that says, 
"Anyone who doesn't vote for 
Bush is an Ass" is inflammato- 
ry and shuts off dialogue. 

Finally, tearing off posters 
from professors' doors is disre- 
spectful, immature and totally 
out of line. Respect my views 
as I respect yours.

to say the very least. I hung up 
the phone and Sat down on the 
couch in my girlfriend's apart-

just happened. 

"What do you want me to 
do about it, sir?" I thought. 
"Maybe your job for starters." 

Let me back up and 
explain what was happening. 
While playing a rousing game 
of one-on-one at the basketball 
courts at Cole, a band of ruffi- 
ans took it upon themselves to 
start harassing myself, my girl- 
friend and anyone else who 
walked by. 

These hoodlums contin-

up and head back to her apart-

over the blatant disrespect to 
my girlfriend and other females 
who walked by, which I will not 

because it is even by my stan- 
dards too harsh. 

I took it upon myself to 
make what would soon be a 
vain attempt to correct this mat- 
ter. Instead of picking a fight or 
referring to the evil-doer's 
mother as a commonly used 
garden tool, I decided, at my 
woman's urging, to phone in a 
complaint.

the Department of Theatre and

Performances will be Friduy,

Rodgers and

show, but it became a classic

mentioned, you "can't imag- 

"Oklahoma!" has been a 
Broadway production since its 
premiere in 1943. 

Based on the play "Green 
Grows the Lilacs" by Lynn 
Riggs. it is the tale of a cowboy 
who falls in love with a farm 
girl amidst an intense rivalry 
between cowboys and farmers. 

Originally, the student 
who was chosen to play the 
female lead got a contract with 
Disney. 

"I couldn't in good con- 
scious make her slay here." said 
Larry Life, the Department of 
Theater's executive director. 
and director of the production. 

Community actor Mindy 
Cox will play the female lead, 
Laurcy, who must choose 



by 



Curly. 



Stackhouse using this to com- 
plete his senior project, and Jud, 
an arrogant cowhand portrayed 
hv Micuhel Palmreuter. 

IPFW senior Melissa 
Dowty performs as Ado Annie 
in the play 

In this production, the 
actors will perform with a larg- 
er orchestra than they usually 
do at Williams Theater, the way 
Rodgers and Hammcrstein 
meant it to be. 

"It's the best way to expe- 
rience it," said Susan Domer, 
the marketing and public rela- 
tion specialist of the School of 
Visual and Performing Arts at 
IPFW. 

This is the tenth produc- 
tion of "Oklahoma!" that Life 
has been involved in, whether it 
be choreography, acting, or 
directing. "I am close to this 
show," Life said. He was born 
in the year the show was writ- 
ten, and he grew up listening to 



"When ihe Philhumium 



Life said. 

The Philharmonic will use 
the pit al the Embassy Centre as 
the actors use the stage. Less 
space spells less orchestra 
(which will be the size of the 
Philharmonic's chamber 

ensemble). This is typical of 
Broadway emsembles. since the 
stage work is the focus of the 
performance. 

Because a musical is such 
a large production, the orchestra 
and the actors practice separate- 
ly. The acting rehearsals are 
accompanied on the piano by 
the Department of Theater's 
musical director, Greg Vey. 

'Toward the end of the 
rehearsal," Vey said, "Tchivzhel 
will observe it." 

Life said that on the 
Sunday before the production 
opens on Friday, the actors will 
have a "sit-probe" with the 
orchestra, where they will sit

Scouts hosting dance Geocaching catching on 



Halloween 
party Oct 31 to 
begin at 7 p jn. 

By Amanda Pierce 



When the leaves turn col- 
ors and the temperature drops, 
most minds turn (o one thing: 
Halloween. 

Although most students 
have conceded to the fact that 
they're too old to trick or treat, 
celebrations are still in order 
come the end of October. 

This year. Campus Scouts 
have stepped up and taken hold 
of tlie haunted happening. They 
have teamed up with the 
Hospitality Club to offer the 
IPFW community and sur- 
rounding areas a new option for 
Halloween celebrations. 

On Oct. 31 at 7 p.m. 

Campus Scouts is sponsoring 

the 2004 IPFW Halloween 

party. This year, Walb Union .

"We hope it gives people something to do. There 

isn 't a lot to do in Fort Wayne that doesn V

wanted to make sure that there was afitn oppor- 
tunity for everybody this Halloween."

"We'd like 
people realize there's more to 
scouting than popcorn, cookies 
and hiking trips, and that we 
aren't all about being perfect 
little conformists. We like to 
have fun. We like to be weird," 
Shannon Johnson said, treasur- 
er of Campus Scouts. 

Serum isn't a stranger to 
the Northeast Indiana area. 
They have played at such ven- 
ues as Sneaky Pete's and 
Legend's Sports Bar. They've 



also been featured on X102's

been guests on X102"s

They are actually a com-

and play both their own songs 
as well as songs from 
Aerosmith, Godsmack, 

DiNiurlu'd and more.

Do you ever miss those 
childhood days from not so 
long ago, when you and your 
friends went on treasure hunts'? 

Introducing: "geo- 

caching" - a cool and exciting 
sport that even adults can play. 
on-campus at IPFW. All you 
need is a GPS (Global 
Positioning System), and 
you're good i 



unlike most others, are intended 
not to leave the United States. 

Confused? All this termi- 
nology may sound like a bunch 
of gibberish. It's almost like a 
science unto itself. And the 
website actually has a list of 
vocabulary words for those of 
us who aren't so familiar with 
the lingo. 

What exactly is a GPS'.' 
The website at www.geo- 
caching.com explains: "A GPS 
unit is a(n) electronic device 
that can determine your approx- 
imate location (within around 
6-20 feet) on the planet. 
Coordinates are normally given 
in Longitude and Latitude. 



You ( 



t the t 



navigate from your 
location to another location. 
Some units have their own 
maps, built-in electronic com- 
passes, voice navigation, 
depending on the complexity of 
the device." 

A GPS can run anywhere 
from $100 to $1,000, depend- 
ing on what options you want to 
get. 



On May I, 2000, then 
President Bill Clinton signed a 
statement that stopped 



,il degradation of the Global 
Positioning System (GPS) sig- 
nals," according to the state- 
ment, "This will mean that 
civilian users of GPS will be 
able to pinpoint locations up to 
ten times more accurately than 
they do now," the document 
continued. 

This allowed people to do 
things like geocaching, which 
previously were impossible. 

Just two days after the state- 
ment was signed, to celebrate 
Clinton's signing of the state- 
ment, "someone outside of 
Portland, Oregon" hid a "contain- 
er of goodies," according to die 
website. 

Mike Teague was first to 
discover the container, and he 
built a personal web page to doc- 
ument the containers. In July of 
the same year, Jeremy Irish 
found Teague's website, and his 
first cache near Seattle, 
Washington. 

Irish approached Teague 
with a new and different website 
design and began to call the sport 
"geocaching." 

Irish developed a new web- 
site and included new features 
like virtual logs and maps. Now 
all 50 United Slates participate in 
the sport, and it has become a 
worldwide phenomena - being 
played in 210 countries, with 
126.096 active caches world- 
wide, as this is being written. 

Any number of items can 
be found in a cache. But the web- 
site warns not to put food into 
them: "Food items are always a 
bad idea. Animals have better 
noses than humans, and in some 
cases caches have been chewed 
through and destroyed because 
of food items in a cache. Please 
do not put food in a cache." It 
also warns not to put explosives, 



says And it reminds us that peo- 
ple of all ages - including chil- 
dren - participate in the game. 

Common things found in a 
cache arc a log, little trinkets, and 
"travel bugs." These are cool lit- 
tle "trackable tags" that can be 
attached to items. The trackabil- 
ity allows the bug to be docu- 
mented on Geocaching.com. and 
it makes the item to which it is 
attached something called a 
"hitchhiker," which is an item 
that "travels from place to 
pl.ee- 

These may end up any- 
where in the world, and it is con- 
sidered common courtesy to log 
it into the computer if you take 

Because this is such a new 
sport, the rules are quite simple. 
The website lists them as: "1, 
Take something from the cache; 

2. Leave something in the cache; 

3. Write about it in the log- 
book. . . Where you place a cache 
is up to you." It is considered 
very rude not to sign the on-line 
logbook after finding a cache 
and taking something from it. 

Caches arc rated on a scale 
of difficulty, where I is the easi- 
est and 5 is die most challenging. 
IPFW's multi-cache is rated at a 
level of 2 for both terrain and dif- 
ficulty, primarily because the 
journey from beginning to end is 
approximately three miles, to get , 
to all four sites. 

The website says, "(The) 
terrain itself is easy - you can get 
pretty close to the sites via paved 
sidewalks. Additional terrain is 
easy to navigate but may be 
muddy. Difficulty rating is for 
finding pill bottles and keeping j 
your activities hidden from mug- 
gles!" (Muggtes, of course, are ,

case, students - die term "mug- •

Hartley said a "good team 
hitting night" is considered 30 
percent. 

Hartley said she hopes the 
vill take away a 
accomplishment 



because they were the school's 
first Division I recruiting class 
for volleyball and have started a 
snowball effect at the school. In 
each of their first two seasons, 
the program finished at just one

As juniors, they helped the

a 22-10 record. This season, the 
team is on pace for 20 wins 
again, currently sitting at 17-8. 






things away from her four years 
at IPFW, including that sense of 
accomplishment. 

"It's a pretty good feeling 
to know that you are a senior," 
she said. "Your teammates 
appreciate what you have done 
for them and the program." 

A volleyball player all her 
life, Bankowski said she is 
proud the program has gotten 
stronger each year as a Division 
I school. She attributed 
Hartley's ability to recruit play- 
ers and willingness to improve. 



Many friendships and les- 
sons of life have been estab- 
lished along the way Bankowski 

And though she didn't cry 
for her final home game, 
Bankowski said it made her 
think. 

"It was sad, but it was just 
a weird feeling that this is it," 
she said. 

Bankowski said fellow 
senior Lindsay Brammer was in 
tears as was her mother before 



"Lindsay is a very nice 
person," Hartley said. "All of 
them are nice, but Lindsay is 
just really nice." 

Hartley said Brammer is 
an excellent lead-by-cxample 
person. She mentioned day after 
day that Brammer motivates the 
other players to do their best. 
She said Brammer isn't the type 
to get into somebody's face; 
instead she is willing to listen 
and understand what the issue is. 

And so it's almost ti

Each has her own charac- 
teristic that makes herself, the 
team and the program better. 
One is resilient as heck, the 
other a proud leader and the 
other a compassionate motiva- 

But each has characteris- 
tics that weren't there when they
