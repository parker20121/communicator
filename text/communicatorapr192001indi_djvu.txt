When The New Yorfc Times decided to run 
its firsl-ever corxoon suip, eiecutives turned to 
Pulitzer Prize- winning canoonisi Jules Feiffer. 

By the time the paper commissioned his 
monthly canoons for their opW pages, Feiffer 
tijd already received much recognition for his 
lengthy tenure at The Village Voice 

Much of FeilTci's renown comes from his 
unique lake on humour. The cartoonist often 
blends unlikely subjecLs such as nuclear destruc- 
tion and sexual relationships in his work. But 
many agree ihai his strong point is his compas- 
sion for hi.'i subjects. 

Feiffer will speak next TTiursday, April 26. 
at 7:30 p.m. in Ihe Walb Union Ballroom in the 
final Omnibus Lecture for the 200O-Of school 



toonisl syndicated internationally, 

Feiffer is also the author of sis plays, two 
novels and three monies. Fifteen collections of 
his cartoons have appeared in book form. His 
first book for children, -The Man in the Ceiling," 
was selected by Publishers Weekly and the New 
York Public Library as one of the best children's 
books of IOT3 His most recem book. "Bark.

He has won numerous awards including an 
Academy Award for animation in the live action 
cartoon "MuniD." Tile cartoon was based on a 
popular strip he had earlier produced about a 
four-year-old boy who had been accidentally 
dnCled into die VS. Armed Forces. 

In 1999. he was awarded an honorary doc- 
torate of Humane Letters from Long Island 
University 

His canoons also appear in The New Yorker,

ogitizable trail that marks Ihis student is his 
respecl and concern for others. 

"My grealesi goal is to improve Ihe lives of 
other people, whether spirilually or economical- 
ly," Henderson said, "Hopefully by living my 
life, I can influence and help others jusi by being

Once tomclhing bad doct hap- 
pen, ihe people pray foi a god [o

iuch ptayei. a new god is bocn. 
Thii li ihe premiie behind 
Uonhend Sludios' new PC 
relwe "Blacfc and While." 

-fllock and While," which 
refeit lo good and evil, is a 
crM» bleed belwccn a limula- 
lion and i lolc playing game, 
allowing players lo lake on the 
role nf a supicmc being called 
Cod, I( it God'i duly lo go 
throughoui I fanlaiy world 
called Eden and govern ihc crc- 
alion process. Whelhci God ii a 
vindictive being or a s&gt;-mpathei- 
ic being n up to the person play- 
ing thai role. 

The game consists of a 
series of challenges, all of 
which involve a little bit of 
thinking to Figure out. Wiih 
every challenge comes iwo 
wayi of doing it. the good or ihc 
bail way. The challenges do not 
come without advice, however. 

Players arc guided by two 
conscience, one an elderly 
angel and the other a chubby lit* 
lie demon, both of whom olTci 
their advice in each situation. 
The angel always recommends 
■he more compassionate 
approach, whereas ihe demon 
always prefers the more hostile 
approach. One such challenge 
featuring differi 



n you're forced lo knock a

The angel character recom- 
mends you use a pile of stones: 
the demon recommends you use 



lenge 
lager ir 






a galc 



ngel recommends 
neip me villager in return lor 
the stone by retrieving her sick, 
lost brother. The demon advises 
you to just demolish her house 
and lake the slone by force. 
These two eniiiics can be both 
very helpful as well as very 

Odier features lo the game 
include a comical sel of sailors 
who can'C get their boat built to 
leave Ihe island. They are a 
prelly demanding group that 
sing their rcqucsLs one after 
another. Though the temptation 
may be to desuoy these sailors, 
should you help them Ihey give 
you a miracle maker in return. 
The game is littered with simi- 
lar situations and decisions, as 
well as various other rewards. 

As Ihc game progresses, 
more and more features are 
unlocked ibai enhance game 
play. One very imponant fea- 
ture that is given lo each player 
after the opening of ihc gale is 
the abilily to choose one of 
three "creaturis." Thiac crea- 

liger — all have different person- 
ality trails, depending on which 
you choose. The cow, for eiam- 
pie, is considered a noble ani- 
mal, whereas Ihc monkey is 
very intelligent and the tiger is 
very aggressive. Once chosen, 
these creatures become pets

role-playing 

game than a 'sim' game. It's 
game style is similar lo that of 
such games as Final Fantasy 
and Diablo II where the story is 
progressed through various 
inter-linked quests. Early on. 
the quests are fairly simple and 
not very challenging. The level 
of dilTlculty no doubt Increases. 

Perhaps the best aspect of 
"Black and White' is its incred- 
ible video- 1 ike graphics. This is 
probably the reason why the 
game took three years lo create. 
iLs graphics make you feel like 
you're in the middle of a Direct 



Soeenshoi courtosv ol 



X video, probably because the 
g.ime's video engine is based 
solely upon Direct X technolo- 
gy. You can hardly icll Ihe dif- 
ference between ihe regular 
game screen and the in. game 
video sequences for this reason. 
That sort of consistency in 
detail is essential to the creation 
of an eicellent looking video 

Another great aspect of 
"Black and ftTiitc" is ihc level 
ipmeni given to the 



higher 



cing" I 




, the player is given the 
chance to control nearly every- 
thing wiihin the game. They can 
remove trees and plant them 
elsewhere, demolish boulders, 
drop rocks on the homes of vil- 
lagers, crcale disciples, perform 
miraclcsand. as the demon said, 
even toss the villagers should 
they get the urge to. The only 
thing that the god cannot con- 
trol is the direction of ihc sloiy 



line, as it was all determined by 
the creators of ihc game when 
the game was made. As was 
staled before, gods can even 
mold the personalities of their 
people and creatures, h is a very 
inleiaclive game in this regard. 
The major downside lo 
this game lies in ill control. 
Although the gome is accurate 
in its perspcclivc. allowing 
players 10 view things from any 
angle they choose, this causes 
the problem of being forced lo 
control four or five different 

the game. It leads to confusing 
game conlrol as u'cll as some 
awkward movement within Ihc 

difTicult to sec things at limes 
and requires a lot of movement 
correction. hindering Ihe 
progress of the game. 

Also, with the enccllenl 
detail paid lo Ihe graphics, 
another problem emerges in the 



area of system requitcmcnis 
The minimum system icquiic 
ments for this game arc J 
Pcnlium 111 -lOO. 64 megs RAM 
and a video card capable of do 
playing 3D graphics Even 

requirements, though, the game 
is going to run a little bit slow at 
times as I had difficulty lunning 
it with my Celcmn 600 on M 
megs RAM. Wiih technology 
quickly advancing in the area of 
computers and with processor 
prices dropping Jusi as rapidly, 
this shouldn't be a problem for 
most people.

I spoke I 






A few weeki ago. 
Jordan starlcd working out 
on a regular baii&gt;. 
Normally thii would rwl 

fact thai he's doing il six 
hours a day thai miKx ihe 
eyebrows. Accoiding lo 
fordan, Itc was Jusi trying 



many of Ihcm said ihat 
ihey used lo waich the 
NBA jusi lo sec what 
Jordan would do; now ihey 
lay Ihat they usually wail 
until the playoffs before 
they gel interciled. 

Argumcnl No. 2: No. 
Jordan, ilay away. First 
off, try lo imagine lordia 
in anything other than a 
Chicago Bulls uniform. 

Second. Jordan did

upper management refuted 
to tign Phil Jackson and

beginning lo piaclice with 
the Wizards. Ihe Icam Ihal 
Jordan owns a share of. 
Accoiding to his possible 
future leamrnales. he looks 
like he's 25 (In case you 

39). 

Lookjng 31 ihe evi- 
dence sialed aboie. I have 
to believe ihal he is plan- 
ning a comeback. So [ 
began Ihinkmg' Is this a 
good thing or had ihing? 1 
pondered thai and came up 
wilh two strong aigumcnls. 

Argument No.

Jordan 

would only he the best 
thing ever lo happen lo Ihe 
NBA. This season, the rat- 
ings for Ihe league have 
been bad. I don't warn lo 
say XFL bad, bul Ihey're 
bad. Even with Ihe playoffs 
fa.'ii approaching, there is 
no reason lo Ihink Ihat the 
ralingi-cven Ihough they 
will increase-will be any- 
thing worth blagging 



Third, look al Ihc way 
he ended his career. He 
made ihc game-winning 
Ileal before hilling Ihe 
game-winning shol over 
one of Ihe better defenders 
m ihc league on the 
enemy's home floor. By 
Ihc way, Jordan enjoys i( a 
lot more when a building 
thai it filled by the dcafcn- 



Thal said. I would 
love lo see him come back 
because he would simply 
be one of the best players 
in Ihc league, I would love 

game -winning shol.
