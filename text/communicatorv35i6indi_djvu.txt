'Voices' 
heard 
against 
violence 

New campus 
organization 
hopes to help 
local victims 

By Kelly Royal 

The Communicator 

Voices Not Victims were 
heard loud and clear on 
Tuesday Oct. 5, when IPFW's 
first domestic violence aware- 
ness group held its first open 
meeting. Two sessions were 
offered in Classroom Medical 
244 to accommodate both day 
and evening students. 

Sophomore Angelina 
Morimanno, founder of Voices 
Not Victims, first became inter- 
ested in the subject of domestic 
violence education after taking 
SOC S161 Principles of 
Sociology taught by IPFW 
Associate Professor 

Christopher Bradley. The two 
discussed the subject and real- 
ized the necessity to establish a 
support group on campus. 

As a survivor of domestic 
violence, Morimanno personal- 
ly experienced the benefits of 
the few support groups avail- 
able within the community. She 
found ii difficult to believe 
IPFW did not already have this 
type of program available.

As 






Farlow had a background in 
studying vertebrae fossils, but 
had never previously worked 
on anything like the recreation 
of a mastodon. 

"When I found out that 
they wanted to do a mastodon 
sculpture, they thought that 
they ought to have someone 
with a paleo background on 
board to help advise them as to 
what the beast should look 
like." Farlow said. 

He found similarities in 
his past work with dinosaurs 
and fossil mammals and the 
mastodon creation. He said that 
the same principles Tor recon- 
structing an animal apply 
whether it is working on a

University preparing 
for Midnight Madness 



First practice 
for basketball 
teams with 
Oct. 15 event 

By Nikole Spencer 

Th e Com muni cator 

The countdown to basket- 
ball season begins Friday Oct. 
-15 at 10 p.m. in Hilliard Gates 
Gymnasium. 

For 120 minutes, campus 
socializing could be at an all- 
time high at Midnight Madness. 
It begins at 10 p.m. and contin- 
ues untill the IPFW basketball 
teams lake the court for their 
first officially sanctioned prac- 



Since IPFW basketball 
went Division 1, Midnight 
Madness is quickly becoming a 
tradition. Through NCAA rules, 
the men's and women's basket- 
ball team can officially start 
practices on Oct. 16. 

Midnight Madness is con- 
sidered a fun way of kicking off 
the season, holding their first

IPFW's Student

Senior Erin McConaha, 
President of the SAB, believes 
it is a good Indiana tradition for

"Midnight Madness is a 
great event and a fun way to 
kick off the basketball season. 
It's also a wonderful way to get

Homecoming as well," 
McConaha said. 

In the past, they have had 
some winning acts. Last year. 
they brought in Project 
Playground - a group that does 
basketball trick comparable to 
the Harlem Globetrotters. Also 
in the past they have had magi- 
cians and Elvis impersonators 

Free food is always avail- 
able and games such as sack 
races and sumo wrestling have 
always been at the event. This 
year, the same will likely hap-

Dear Editor, 

This corrcspondet 
is in regards to a "Letter to the 
Editor" written by Mr. J. 
Edmondson and also the 
members of the Student 
Government of IPFW. When 
reading the letter from 
Edmondson, I was dismayed 



; the : 






Not only are those sta 
its very callous, they [

actually knows the variot 
members of the IPSGA woul 
agree with me. 

Edmondson, if you wei 
bothered by the elcctio 
process required at IPFW. you 
should have communii 
your discontent in a method 
that was proper, precise and 
free from malicious slander. If 
you want to make suggestions 
for future change, it is no' 
sible to put forth slander 
towards fellow students who 
are doing "what is necessary" 
to get involved in the IPSGA 
and IPFW. 

I have to admit, I \ 
not keen on the idea of having 
to collect 50 signatures to get 
elected into the IPSGA. It w 
only my "sincere motivate 
to get involved at my univi 
sity that sparked the courage 
to ask strangers for their sup- 
port, which I did in a respect- 
ful manner. I took less than a 
minute of each student's time 
and not a single individual 
seemed to be bothered by the 
minor interruption. In fact, 
several students curii

If any student is cur

Most people with children

Not a day goes by that I

Revolution, part I

was what is to be done with social change. I look towards

I'm running for president. 
I'm only in my second year of

2004: the master debaters 



The Presidential Debates 
are pivolal in so many ways, 
but should they be? The 
University of Miami in Coral 
Gables, Fla. hosted Ihe first of 
three debates held where 
President George W. Bush and 
contender Massachusetts 

Senator John. F. Kerry can face 
off on the issues. 

Many news organizations, 
including CBS and Fox News 
have stated in their reports that 
these debates can greatly influ-

Thirty-iwo pages have 
been issued to regulate nearly 
every aspect of Ihe debate, and 
keep any inappropriate actions 
from occurring. Still, the first 
debate was about as useful to let's Ii

How important are the 
debates? Well, that depends on 
who you ask. A famous exam- 
ple would be the I960 debates 
between John F. Kennedy and 
Richard M. Nixon. Of course, 
people who watched the 
debates thought Kennedy won, 
and people who listened on the 
radio argued in favor of Nixon. 

Personally, I don't care 
who looked better, and would 
say Nixon won the debate either 
way. 1 do, however, undersland 
the importance of appearing 
professional and "presidential" 
when you speak. Yet, this raises 
an important question aboul

IPFW Vs. Western Illinois 

Sunday. Oct. 3, isn't nor- 
mally considered a holiday, but 
it seemed like a bizarre one for 
IPFW fans. 

In a game that featured 
more cards than Mother's Day, 
Western Illinois, playing with a 
man advantage for 89 minutes, 
finally finished off IPFW 2-1, 
in double-overtime on Sunday 
at the Hefner Soccer Complex, 

The Wcstcrwinds opened 
the scoring at the 6-minute 
mark on a goal by Kelly 
Warner, who made a nice move 
in front and hit the open corner. 

The "cardfest" began as 
IPFW was setting up lo take a 

mark. Referee Shane Foley 
ruled that Kristin Mahoney had 
hit a WIU player with an elbow 
before the kick, Foley issued a 
"red" card, sending Mahoney to

damage had been done as IPFW 
would play the rest of the match 
short-handed. 

The Mastodons would get 
the equalizer at the 65-minutc 
mark of the second half. 
Meghan Doehlu was fouled in 
the box, and was awarded a 
penalty shot. She had no prob- 
lem beaiing Wcstcrwinds' keep- 
er Carey Cowhcy. 

The game would go to 
two overtimes, and with just 
over 6-minutes remaining, WIU 
began attacking the IPFW goal. 

Warner, looking for her 
second goat of ihe game, shot 
through a screen. IPFW keeper 
Shannon Lynn caught site of 
the ball just in lime to steer it 
away from the goal, but it 
ended up out tap. Bess Rapp 
got Ihe ball to the left side of the 
goal, and Angic Guy buried it 
tor the game winner. 

The loss drops the 'Dons 
to 3-7-0 on the- season. They 
take on the Butler Bulldogs on

grasp. The coach worries that 
might make it a long game. 

"We'll just have to wait 
and see," he said. 

There are bright spots for 
the team, Stcfankiewicz notes. 
Freshman Anika Apar is a 
threat anytime she has the ball. 
Senior captain Meghan DoeFlla, 
a defensive specialist, has 
stepped up her leadership on 
the field and junior Shannon 
Rinearson has contributed on 
defense as well. 

With eight games remain- 
ing, the coach is hoping the 
injuries heal quickly, and well. 

Stefankiewicz docs 

appreciate ihe effort he has 
seen from the squad.
