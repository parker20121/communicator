Committee recommends new registration system 



By MICHELE R. SHAFFER 
Managing Editor 
When students go to register next year for classes in Fall 1986, they could face a 
whole new registration system. 

The Committee on Academic Advising, along with Registrar Jack Dahl, 
recommended a revision of the present registration policy recently to the Arts and 
Letters Policy Committee. 
The proposal being considered states: 

1. Registration processing for the following major semester will normally begin 
on Monday of the tenth week of the semester in progress. Summer registration ... 
will be comparable .. and will be announced by the registrar's office. 

2. Students whose registration forms have been signed by their advisors may 
come to the Registrar's Office during normal office hours and will be served in the 
order of their appearance. That is to say, there will be no establishing of timetables 
by alphabetical order or class standing. 

3. Fee payment dates will be established by the Bursar's Office in a way that is 
complementary to the registration processing schedule. 

4. Schedule adjustments will be permitted throughout the processing period on 
any day registration processing takes place.

Exam schedule corrected 

Due to a printer's error in the final exam schedule found in the Fall Semester 
Schedule of Classes, those students attending evening classes should consult 
their instructors for correct exam times 

Workshops scheduled 

Three Financial Aid Workshops have been scheduled by the rPFW Financial 
Aid Office to help students and their parents complete the 1986-87 Financial Aid

Memorial Union, will be held at 7 p.m. Jan. 16 and at noon and 7 p.m. on Jan. 20. 
The Financial Aid Office will begin handing out the FAF for 19B6-87 during the 
week of Dee. 11, however, students are advised not to mail the form to Prin- 
ceton, N.J., until after Jan. 1 . The priority filing date is March 1, 1986. The FAF 
is the application used to apply for the Pell Grant, State Student Assistance 
Commission of Indiana (SSACI) and all federal and institutional scholarships, 
grants and loans. The workshops will be part of the observance of Financial 
Aid Awareness Week to help students remember the importance of filing aid 
forms accurately, completely, and by the March 1 deadline.

precedence over all other events in the Infograph column. Deadline for in- 
fographs and letters is Monday at noon. The Communicator will also accept 
photos for publication. The deadline for photos is also Monday at noon. 



5. Registration processing will continue through the Thursday before classes 
begin, and late registration will take place during the first week of classes. 
However, the Registrar may designate some days during the period before classes 
begin when processing will be recessed 

Presently, the class registration is done alphabetically, in early and regular 
registration. Preference is also given to upperclassmen. Graduate students, 
seniors, and spring degree candidates register first, followed by juniors, 
sophomores and freshmen. 

Students may either regislet at their scheduled time on the timetable in the 
schedule of classes, or at a later date during the same registration period, ac- 
cording to the policy stated in the Spring schedule of classes. 

The purpose of the revision, according to Jack Dahl, registrar, is to eliminate the 
long lines that occur when students wait until the last minute to pay their fees after 
registering. 

Dahl said there was an additional problem which caused the consideration of 
such a proposal. The academic advisors find they have trouble advising the 
multitude of students coming into their office at the last minute requesting ad- 
vising. Too many students wait too long to go to their advisors for counseling ac- 
cording to Dahl. "Advisors can' t see that many students," said Dahl. 



Leaders and students 
study higher education 



He added the Registrar's Office is having no problem with the present 
registration system, however his office recognizes the problem advisors can have. 
"We are being supportive to their desire to resolve their problem, " said Dahl. 

In a notice sent toThe Communicator, the proposal was supposed to be discussed 
at an Arts and Letters Policy committee meeting on Nov 19 However, according 
to Professor Julius Smulkstys, Dean of the School of Arts and Letters, that was not 
done. "Actually, we did not meet on that day," said Smulkstys. The proposal, 
according to Smulkstys, was authored by the Advising Committee which is chaired 
by Professor Donna Worthley. 

Smulkstys added he could recognize the feelings that upperclassmen should 
receive first priority in registering. "I thinkk that is an important consideration," 
said Smulkstys. "However, another consideration is that freshmen should be given 
the opportunity to get into more programs," 

"There is a lot to be said for seniors who need to get into certain classes to 
graduate," continued Smulkstys, "but freshmen also should be given this op- 
portunity as new members of the campus community." 

One thing this proposal might do, according to Dahl, is "give students the in- 
centive to go see their counselors sooner." 



ByEARLSMITH 

Chief Reporter 

Approximately 40 students and 

community leaders met for breakfast 
Nov 25, followed by a symposium, 
"Improving Higher Education in the 
Face of New Federalism." 

Speaking at the symposium was 
Fourth District Congressman Dan 
Coals, Assistant Professor C James 
Owen of the School of Public and En- 
vironmental Affairs, and Sam Rea, a 
member of the Indiana Commission on 
Higher Education. 

Representative Coals said there is a 
desire in both the legislative and 
judicial branches to balance the 
budget. The amount spent on Pell 
grants, guaranteed student loans work- 
study programs are "driven not by 
policy decisions but by budget 
decisions,'' Coats said. 

Congress is currently considering the 
Graham-Rudman Bill, which is a plan 
to balance the budget on an in- 
cremental basis by 1991. said Coats. 
This means the Federal government 
will be less involved in funding higher 
education and the stales will be more 
involved, he said. 

"That's a reality we'll be facing for at 
least the next five years and maybe 10 



or more years," Coats said. 

Prior to Coats' speech, Owen 
outlined the history of federal in- 
volvement in higher education. It 
began, he said, with the Morril Act of 
1862 which established the land grant 
universities, such as Purdue. 

During the 20th century there has 
been a gravitation of power to the 
central government. This gravitation 
was reversed when President Richard 
Nixon Instituted New Federalism in 
1974, said Owen. 

New Federalism has gained support 
during both Democratic and 
Republican administrations during the 
last decade. 

Rea outlined the function of the 
Commission on Higher Education. He 
said the commission's only purpose is 
to recommend what the legislature 
should do in regard to university 
budgets and building programs. "We 
have no final say in these matters," he 
said. 

About 20 percent of the stale budget is 
given to higher education and the 
largest share of state university 
operating funds (63 percent) comes 
from legislative appropriations. 

' 'The state puts in four times what the 
Federal government does," said Rea.

Senate debates controversial pornography issue 



ByEARLSMITH 

Chief Reporter 

Student senators wrestled with their 
first controversial issue of the semester 
during their last meeting. By a 10-3 
vote, student senate passed resolution 
6586- G which opposes the sale of por- 
nographic magazines and posters by 
Follett's bookstore. 

The issue of free expression came up 
early in the discussion, but proponents 
of the resolution stated the material 
was readily available at other locations 
in Fort Wayne, and didn't need to be 
sold on campus. 

The resolution also touched off 
discussion regarding the student 
senators role in the IPFW community 
Student Senate has the right to take 
positions on controversial issues, said 



Joe Motherwell, Student Body 
president. 

Student senators also discussed their 
responsibility to represent student 
opinion. Members of Student Senate 
need to be concerned with the feelings 
of all students, said Motherwell. "We 
must keep in mind the needs of 
minority opinion as well as majority 
opinion," he said. 

Proponents of the resolution 
questioned whether such non-academic 
material had a place in an academic 
bookstore. Student Senate Clerk Sheri 
Kaltenmark noted the Indiana 
University- Blooming ton bookstore had 
only academic materials. 

In other action: 

Bill 8586-8 was unanimously ap- 
proved This allows alumni to use the 



typewriters in the library by showing 
an alumni club membership card. 

Resolution 8586-G was unanimously 
approved, and will allow student 
government to initiate a campus guided 
lour program during spring semester 
using volunteers. 

President Motherwell announced 
there were still openings on three 
faculty student committees. Those 
assigned, and their committees follow: 

Affirmative Action Committee: 
Michael Edmonds, Tonja Rose.

Gorney, Jill Adamson, Kristin Kellems,

Internships provide opportunities for success 



Reprinted In part from "Discovering 
a career path through Internships" by 
Greg Crossflcld 

There is an important distinction 
between an internship and a summer 
job The primary objective of a sum- 
mer job is to earn spending money. 
With an internship, the focas is on 
picking up skills and knowledge that 
will prove useful in the future. Money is 
a secondary consideration. A little 
sacrifice now could yield big dollars in 
the future. 

Richard Bolles suggests in "What 
Color is Your Parachute?" the best way 
to get any job is through connections 
You lack the right connections? Guess 
again. You have more connections than 
you could ever use. That's because of 
another of Bolles's principles, namely 
everyone you know and meet is a 
connection. They become contacts 
when they know your interests and 
think of people who might help in your 
job search. 



This random technique works, but 
making contacts at the vice 
presidential level works faster. That's 
because these people have the power to 
find or create jobs throughout the 
company. And given they are involved 
with both current and future plans, 
they can offer an enlighted view of the 
company 

Campus is one of the best places to 
cultivate these connections. One ob- 
vious way is through alumni and 
alumni publications. 

Guest speakers can prove helpful as 
well. For the really popular figures, it 
will be tough to get a chance to in- 
troduce yourself. But even if you don't 
meet the speakers, the chances are 
good they will agree to meet with you 
later. Just drop a note mentioning the 
speech and request a meeting. If the 
speaker is from a company that is far 
away, consider taking a trip there 
during vacation. Most students won't 
make that extra effort, so your com- 
petition is less than it may seem. 



True, traveling to interviews can be 
expensive, but consider it a part of 
gelling a good internship. Costs can be 
reduced, however, by planning ahead, 
scheduling a couple of interviews per 
trip. 

After making connections, the next 
concern is developing a rapport. This is 
done through another of Richard 
Bolles's principles, the informational 
interview. 

This interview is just as it sounds. Its 
main purpose is to gather information, 
not to seek a job. By being a college 
student requesting information, you 
pose no threat. People naturally want to 
be helpful and providing information is 
always easier than finding a job for 
someone. 

Do your homework on the company 
and the person belore the interview. 
Then go in and conduct an intelligent 
conversation. Don't expect anything 
more than an enlightened discussion. 

But if you present yourself well, you 



could gel something like, "We might be 
able to use you." Translation: 
"Welcome tothe company . " The rule to 
remember is never ask for a job during 
an informational interview. If they 
want to turn it into a recruiting session, 
great But if you ask for an In- 
formational meeting, don't try to 
change the agenda before the interview 
starts. 

If you aren't given some type of offer 
during the interview, stay in touch and 
ask outright later. When January rolls 
around, ask if any internships are 
available. Timing is crucial. 

Once at work, the main issue is en- 
suring your internship is truly a lear- 
ning experience. Creale your own 
learning opportunities. Make the most 
of the experience.

Registration proposal, 
not a big improvement 



The Committee on Academic Advising 
have proposed revisions for the 
registration process at IPFW, The 
revisions, which would lake effect in the 
fall of 1986, were outlined in a memo sent 
to The Communicator. 

This policy presents several problems 
for the students and the Registrar's 
Office. Without registration timetables, 
the Registrar's Office runs the risk of 
being over-run with students one 
moment and at a standstill the next. 

Seniors registering for their final 
semester may find the classes they need 
to graduate are already filled with 
underclassmen. 

Creation of a processing fee to defer 
the expense of excessive scheduling 
adjustments means one thing: more 
money for the university ... out of the 
student's pockets. 

Students who register late, for any 
reason, miss the benefits of the first few 
class sessions; the period of "settling" 
into class routine, the professor's course 
introduction, and any class work 
assigned or lectures given during the 
first week. 

While we realize changes in the 



present registration process are 
necessary, this proposal creates as 
many problems as it solves. 

We suggest more departments process 
registration forms for students, a 
practice, for example, sometimes used 
by the School of Arts and Letters. 

With this policy, departments would 
process registration forms for students, 
eliminating the lines of students which 
form outside the Registrar's Office 
during scheduled registration. Fee 
statements would be mailed from the 
department to the student with a 
payment schedule allowing for postal 
time. 

When classes are full, scheduling 
adjustments would be made by the 
Registrar's office. Students would then 
drop or add classes if necessary by 
taking a signed drop-add card to the 
Registrar's Office. 

This policy, would save the students 
valuable time and help reroute the 
registration confusion in the Registrar's 
Office. Any new policy should aid the 
students, after all, and eliminating time 
— wasting steps in the registration 
process is the best way to do so. 



Sporting events lack 
fan support and spirit 




WE S£EN TH&amp; BOSTON ittrftfiTrVN. $*&gt; T&amp;tfW&amp;BK 

cin flARA-mofcifou/., . 



I walked into the Multipurpose 
Building a couple of weeks ago, and I 
was hit with a pleasant surprise The 
scene was the first IPFW men's 
basketball game, and it was slightly 
shocking to see the amount of people 
supporting the Mastodons. 

As proven on that night of Nov. 23, 
IPFW basketball, as well as other 
sports, can provide fun and excitement. 
As the Mastodons came close to 
defeating Wright State, the number two 
team in the nation in Division II, it was 
pleased to see the fans cheering, yelling, 
and just giving our team general 
support. 

Why was I so surprised to see all of 
these people? After seeing the number of 
fans at last year's games (or the lack 
thereof), the support at the first game 
this season pleased me I often 
wondered: why could high school teams 
generate so much spirit and 
"electricitv." and a college team 
can't? The well-known argument of 
"IPFW is a commuter campus, and 
everyone works, and doesn't have time 
to stay around school" doesn't stick with 



us. Many high school students hold jobs, 
and they certainly aren't on "campus" 
at all times. 

Although the sports enthusiasts were 
numerous at the first basketball game, I 
still believe that the Mastodons deserve 
just a few more loyal fans. I would hope 
to see more students at the games, as I 
noticed that many of the supporters 
seemed to be parents or relatives of the 
athletes. 

Mastodon athletics have come a long 
way since their birth several years ago. 
The athletic program has grown into 
Division II competition, and, as shown, 
provides diversion and entertainment. 
Also, the program is composed of more 
than just basketball. Soccer, tennis, 
cross country, volleyball and baseball 
are just a few of the programs that 
IPFW offers. 

Fan support is becoming a reality at 
IPFW. The "home court advantage" 
often spoken of can finally be just that 
this year. Hopefully this support will 
continue to grow and to be even more 
successful.

To the Editor: 

There was a time when I 
would have been pleased to 
meet the hip, crusading 
editor of The Communicator, 
but the editorial comments 
regarding Follett's 
Bookstore saved me the 
trouble 

The editor is obviously a 
Little Old Lady in Tennis 
Shoes. 

And like all' L.O.L.I.T.S., 
she plays pretty fast and 
loose with the word "por- 
nography " There's not a 
court in the land that can 
make up its mind to what 
pornography is, and The 
Communicator is certainly 
no better equipped to 
provide that judgement, 
especially on behalf of a 
student body that is more 
than old enough to decidefor 
itself. 

Pornography has always 
been an easy target for 
buzz word- hungry editors 
looking for a witch lo burn, 
and this editor I 
predictably), has firmly 
planted herself outside 
Follett's Bookstore to pass 
out pitchforks and torches 
And tennis shoes. 

from the" ac- 
companying poll taken of 
students' opinions on the 
subject, she will find 
precious few to join her in a 
hearty chorus of constipated 
"Harrumphs." 

the central 
issue here is censorship, in 
spite of The Communicator's 
attempt to sneak it past us in 
the sugarcoated form of a 
"Student resolution" 



( whatever the heck that is) . 

The Communicator uses a 
lot of specious arguments lo 
make its point, but I don't 
care how many professors 
grumble about Follett's or 
how convenient Walgreens 
is, or how big Follett's profit 
margin is (that's none of The 
Communicator's business, 
anyway) or what kind of 
image "Playboy" gives to 
the students of I.P.F.W, 
(The editor doesn't care that 
Follett's also sells Cliffs 
Notes, that bible for mental 
bidgets too lazy to read the 
book). This is all just a 
genteel way of advocating 
book-burning. If that seems 
to be an exaggeration, let me 
remind the reader that 
history has shown that every 
book thrown in the fire 
makes it that much easier to 
throw in the next, 

Our provincial editor must 
realize that universities (and 
even "commuter cam-

puses") are supposed to be 
institutions dedicated (o the 
encouragement of inquiring 
minds, and a truly inquiring 
mind is curious about 
everything. Even things that 
our editor finds personally 
repugnant. 

It is not a question of 
whether or not our campus 
"needs" these magazines, It 
doesn't "need" a dreadfully 
boring newspaper either. 
The only "need" is that these 
things be allowed. 

In case you haven't 
noticed, gentle reader, I take 
great offense at being told by 
the likes of this newspaper 
what itis that I "need!" 

And you Linville! My 
wrath does not fall short of 
you and your damnable 
cartoon, accompanying the 
editorial!

forms of censorship, pride in 
my calling demands (hat I

Ever draw a female nude, 
Linville? Of course you 
have. It's part of your ar-

But don't let the 
L.O.L.I.T.S. see it happen, or 
any of your cartoons they 
don't happen to agree with 
[assuming that you don't 
continue to sell out). 

Someday, they might 
decide that you don't "need" 
a job.

opinions of The Com-

weekly by a majority vote of 
an editorial board and are 
not the sole views of the 
editor-in-chief. — In --fact, 
editorials are usually 
written by board members 
other than the editor. As 



staff illustrator, Mike 
Linville's cartoons must

the editorial board.

Tuition payback plan could attract new teachers 



San Francisco, Calif. — A plan thai would have college 
graduates teach four years in return for payment of college 
tuition has received the support of National Education 
Association President Mary Hatwood Futrell, 

' 'We simply have to do more to attract people into teaching 
if we are to meet the coming teacher shortage Colleges and 
universities have to explore new approaches, and I think this 
idea has a great deal of merit," Futrell told writers at a San 
Francisco Press Club meeting October 22. 



The idea, first proposed by Frank Newman, former 
President of the University of Rhode Island, first appeared in 
a recent report for the Carnegie Foundation for the Ad- 
vancement of Teaching. 

Newman's proposal is similar to incentive and grant 
programs some colleges and universities had in place during 
the '50s and '60s. 

Under Newman's plan, students would pay back loans by 
spending a weekend a month in teacher braining and the 



summer months in rural or ghetto schools or helping children 
wiuTspociaT needs Upori~graduation, the students would give 
back four years of college by teaching 

The NEA predicts that the teacher shortage will increase 
each year until the 1990s, with between 900,000 and 1 6 million 
new teachers needed as current teachers retire or leave the 
profession and the current baby boomlet continues to In- 
crease school enrollments.

Avoid needless hassles from mail-order catalogs 



West Lafayette — Many 
people think mail order 
catalogs are a hassle-free 
way to get Christmas 
shopping done. Not so. 

Mail-order companies 
were No. 1 on the Council of 
Better Business Bureaus' 
list of inquiries and com- 
plaints during 1983, with late 
deliveries being one of the 
most frequently cited 
problems. If your order 
didn't come when expected, 
first check with local postal 
officials to see if they are 
holding the package for you 
for some reason. If not, then 
the Federal Trade Com- 
mission's mail-order rule 
may apply. 

Under the rule, your order 
must be shipped within the 
time promised by the seller. 
If no time is stated, shipping 
must be within 30 days of 
receipt of your properly 



completed order and 
payment. 

If your order can't be filled 
as you want and on time, the 
seller must notify you when 
your order will be shipped 
You may then cancel the 
order in writing if you wish. 
If you don't respond, this 
means you have accepted 
the new shipping date. 

If the new delivery date is 
more than 30 days past the 
original date promised, you 
will again be notified and 
given the choice of accepting 
the new shipping date or 
canceling the order entirely. 
This time, either action you 
take must be done in writing, 
and the seller must provide 
you an easy method of 
canceling at no cost to you. 

If at any time you decide to 
cancel the order — and have 
duly notified the seller — 
your money must be 




to this rule include magazine 
subscriptions (after the first 
issue is shipped), COD or- 
ders, photo finishing and 
seeds or growing plants. 

It's especially important 
when ordering to make sure 
all the information 
requested on the order form 
is included, particularly 
your zip code. And above all, 
do not send cash. Checks or 
money orders are best since 
you have a record of 
payment. 

The law is specific on how 
consumers should handle 
other aspects of mail orders, 
such as damaged or spoiled 
goods and unsatisfactory 
merchandise. To know how 
to deal with these situations

sexually offensive mail you 
did not request — write for a

Kim Detwiler and Mmirc 
moment as Eddie and May in "Fool for Love." The play. 
marking [he directorial debul of Joel K. Murray, ends this 
■weekend. (Photo courtesy of PIT) 



By M. KATHLEEN GREVEN 
Features Editor 

Some people apparently need pain to convince themselves 
they are alive In "Fool for Love," physical and emotionaJ 
pain are inflicted in large doses. 

This Sam Shepard play, directed by Joel K. Murray, 
illustrates the lives of two people who belong together. May 
i Maureen Ryan) and Eddie (Kim Detwiler) are both adept 
at dispensing verbal and physical abuse. They're both 
domineering. They both seem to have had a partial 
lobotomy. 

Review 

She's incapable of making decisions and he cannot 
distinguish fact from fantasy. Adding to the confusion is the 
Old Man (Satch GatchelK who might be May or Eddie's 
conscience, and Martin, (Kevin Gilbert) the comic relief 
bumpkin character. All of these characters are reduced to 
being caricatures, which makes them seem like they're 
moving through a dream for the thousandth time, reliving 
the situation night after night in their sleep. We don't know if 
this set of circumstances has ever actually transpired, or if 
it's a practice round for when the dream comes true. 

The action of the play begins in the middle of a 15-year-old 
argument. Within minules, Ryan and Detwiler are bouncing 
each other off the walls of a sleazy motel on the edge of the 
Mojave Desert, setting the tone for the next hour or so. 

In a recent interview, Murray stated he chose this play 
because "This is what speaks to me." did the play pipe up 
and say, "PSSSST! Joel! Take this very introspective and 
emotional play about two lovers and make it monotonously 
violent!" 

Ryan and Detwiler punctuate nearly every sentence with a 
body slam into the nearest solid surface. Everything on 
stage is slammed, pummelled with fists, knocked over, drop- 
kicked or stomped on. 

"Fool for Love," marking Murray's directorail debut at 
PIT, could have been an intricately woven web of fantasy 
and indecision, if the point hadn't been driven home with a 
sledge hammer. 



Symphonic Wind's debut charms audience 



By SEBASTIAN CHAPMAN 
Staff Writer 
Mrs. Claudia Slabaugh, 
D?FW instructor of music, 
was the performing guest at 
the recent Symphonic Winds 
concert held in Neff Recital 
Hall Nov. 21 

The instructor performed 
a flute solo during Cecile 
Chaminades' "Concerto for 
Flute." 

"I've seen the piece 
mature, I guess you might 
say," said Mrs. Slabaugh, 
"It's one of my lavorite flute 
pieces." She uses a very 
loose relaxed style that she 



refers to as a "singing 
style." "It took me a while lo 
develop my style, it's not 
just something that I 
acquired overnight," she 
added. 

As the concert progressed, 
the difficulty of the music 
increased. The band's fourth 
selection, "Slava," was its 
most challenging of the 
evening, 'it's one of those 
pieces that's fun to play but 
is as tough as heck." com- 
mented Dr. Cavanagh, 
although it was performed 
quite well, and was 
highlighted by a smooth 



saxophone solo played by 
Dean Smekens. 

During a brief pause in the 
evening's performance, Dr. 
Cavanagh thanked the band 
for welcoming him back to 
the midwest. "Although this 
is only my first semester at 
IPFW. I'm no stranger to the 
midwest. The band has 
made me feel right at home 
and I'd like you to know that 
we've just begun to develop 
the program. The best is yet 
to come." 

While the band continues 
to prepare for its April 17 
debut, Dr Cavanagh intends 
to keep the musicians busy. 



"We'll be playing several 
concerts for local schools 
and a few other per- 
formances that we've 
scheduled. I'd like to see the 
band perform as much as 
possible until the spring 
opener." 

After the applause of the 
audience faded, the band 
began their last selection, 
"Ritual." The primitive 
sounds of Vaclav Nelhybel's 
"controlled fury" captivated 
the audience as Dr. 
Cavanagh rhythmically 
directed the musicians to an 
"explosive" finale. 



Before 

a lifetime 

of adventure. 

they lived the adventure 

of a lifetime.

Features Edi lor 

The day after. Knots of 
people clutching their 
worldly belongings wander 
through the crowd, gazing 
blankly into space. 

More tenacious survivors 
weave through the throngs, 
impatiently jostling the 
slower moving groups. 
Children dart into the crowd 
— babies cry — everyone 
tries to cope 

Now more than ever, a 
social caste system is 
evident. The affluent, in 
their leather and furs, can 
afford to store their 
belongings in rented lockers 
and stroll at a leisurely pace. 
Members of the working 
class trudge through the 
crowds clad in matching 
nylon jackets or cloth car- 
coats, lugging their 
possessions with them. 

The gulf widens further 
when pangs of hunger strike. 
The elite groups can still 
afford to dine in comfort in 



earby restaurants, while 
the less fortunate are 
resigned to eating what fare 
is available at hand, usually 
ingesting their food while 
standing in huddles to 
protect their packages. 

This is not the aftermath of 
a nuclear war, but a much 
more immediate danger. It 
ultimately affects us all, 
causing families lo be split 
up for days at a time, even 
spawning fights in more 
severe cases. 

I am speaking, of course, 
about the day after 
Thanksgiving. 

One day, we're with our 
loved ones, enjoying a fine 
meal and basking in the glow 
of companionship. 

Traditionally, women lend to 
the edible aspects of the 
day's festivities while the 
men immerse themselves in 
the requesite football game 
Even siblings put aside their 
rivalries to play cards or 
recite jokes with each other. 

Then, in the dark o( the 
night, those same men, 
womenand children undergo 



certain physiological 
changes. 

Normally good natured 
men resemble snarling dogs 
as soon as they gel behind 
one of the many cars aimed 
at the shopping mall, 
making them late getting 
home from work. Instead of 
being greeted with the 
aroma of a lovingly 
prepared dinner, he finds 
cold turkey sandwiches in 
the (ridge, bearing the note, 
"Gone shopping. Enjoy!" 

The wife now spends her 
evenings prowling the malls, 
in search of Transformers, 
Battlebones. Cabbage Patch 
Twins, socks and underwear 
for her family. She becomes 
very secretive, vowing she'll 
shoot-to-kill any 

unauthorized personnel 
caught rooting through her 
closet. 

Changes in children are 
the most dramatic. Cuddly 
eight-year-olds are tran- 
sformed into snivelling, 
whining, greedy urchins 
wielding a "want list" that 



could keep them warm at 18 
degrees F 

Boys suddenly promise to 
stop referring lo Iheirsislers 
as *'Hey, stupid!" if they 
could have Greyskull and 
Battlebones. Their sisters 
vow not to seek-and-deslroy 
Mom's makeup in exchange 
for a fur coat for their 
Cabbage Patch doll. 

But this phenomena is not 
confined to the family unit 
Friends become absolutely 
malicious, with sing-song 
taunts, "You're going to love 
what I got you for Christ- 
mas!" For the next few 
weeks, parties (read gift 
giving occasions) abound. 
The office buddies, school 
chums, golf partners, neigh- 
bors, in-laws, card club, 
bowling league ... all get 
together to party the nights 
and paychecks away. 

Christmas finally arrives. 
To prove that we are not an 
entirely pagan society, most 
families dutifully troop off to 
church — even if they have 
to call and get directions. 
After the children fidget for 



about an hour, it's home to 
what Mom's been working so 
hard for the last month. THE 
PRESENTS. 

The momentarily cherubic 
youngsters hastily dissect 
their gift wrapped parcels 
and squeal with delight. 
"Mom! The fur coat for 
Matilda! How did you ever 
guess?" It was only items 
one, six and ten on her list. 
Mom thinks to herself Next, 
Mom and Dad thank each 
other for the matching 
flannel robe and slipper set 
and the radial arm saw 
blades, complementing each 
other on their good taste. 

Once again, everyone is 
basking in the glow of 
companionship, and within 
three days, life's back to 
normal. For the next n 
months, Dads get home from 
work without getting stuck in 
a traffic jam, Moms lovingly 
prepare the family's dinner, 
boys address their sisters as 
"Hey, stupid!" and girls 
continue to seek-and-destroy 
Mom's makeup. 



Jazz Ensemble demonstrates its versatility 




By SEBASTIAN CHAPMAN 
Staff Writer 

As a crowd gathered 
outside Neff Recital Hall, 
recognizable sounds coming 
from within were the wailing 
of saxes, the beat of an 
audacious drummer, and a 
barely audible 



strume 



alists 



warming up to reveal the 
1985- 86 Jazz Ensemble. 

Their selections included 
"A Foggy Day" by George 
Gershwin, "Boston 
Marathon" by Gary Burton 



and "Superslick" by Mike 
Barone, during which an 
elderly gentleman was 
observing the rhythm by 
bobbing his head back-and- 
forth with a smile on his face 
that would put Carol 
Channing to shame. 

The first selection, "Big 
Momma Case," included 
three solos TrumpetistTodd 
Phillips, alto saxophonist 
Andy Hiner, tenor 

saxophonist David Vining 
and trombonist Pat Dennis 
all performed solos 



exhibiting the finer qualities 
of their instruments. 

Saxman David . Vining 
particularly sent the 

audience into a frenzy. 
Rocking from side-to-side 
with eyes closed, Vining 
demonstrated his command 
of the tenor sax by easily 
"ripping off" an assortment 
of scales. 

"That Warm Feeling," the 
band's third piece, was 
laidback. The pretty 
variations of pianist Mark 
Meussling set the lazy mood 



the audience seemed to 
enjoy most. 

Before the concert, while 
nervously awaiting the 
arrival of his audience, 
Director David Lehrman 
said even though the band 
appears to meet most 
requirements for com- 
petition, it won't be com- 
peting He thinks the band 
is too "young and inex- 
perienced" for competition. 

"I'm not saying we won't 
compete this year, but it 
doesn look that way," he 



said. 

Lehrman, a well-known 
saxophonist in the city, 
participated in the concert 
also. During "Boston 
Maraihon" he delivered an 
alto -sax solo living up to 
every bit of the Lehrman 
name. The piece was played 
by some of the guys in the 
band who get together from 
lime to time and practice 
soloing. Drummer Todd 
Harrold got into the act, too, 
demonstrating the skills that 
earned him the nickname 
"audacious."

IPFW cagers suffer weekend losses 



ByTONYMJNAWAY 
Stair Writer 

All-American Mark Vest's 
21 points far powerful Wright 
Slate paved the way for a 75- 
66 victory over IPFW in the 
first home men's basketball 
game this season on Nov. 23. 

The Raiders' have all five 
starters back from last 
year's team, and their ex- 
perience and skill were 
evident as they dominated 
the young Mastodons during 
the first half of play. The 
Raiders held a 29-9 edge in 
rebounds and outscored the 
Mastodons 49-26at thehalf. 

The Mastodons came back 
in the second half, out- 



rebounding Wright State 33- 
19 and, led by Richard Ivy's 
14 points, outscored the 
Raiders 40-26. The 
Mastodons pulled to within 
seven points twice, but the 
Raiders managed to hold 
them off at the end. 

Coach Tim Russell says, 
"Our team is still learning lo 
play as a unit, but by mid- 
December we will begin to 
jell. By then T should know 
what combinations work 
together best." 

Over the Thanksgiving 
holiday last Saturday, the 
Mastodons traveled to 
Murray State. The Racers, 
the first Division 1 leam on 



IPFW's schedule ever, 
defeated the Mastodons 57- 
51 David Lutes led IPFW 
with 10 points, and Ivy was 
second in Mastodons 
scoring, with nine points. 
Steve Driver finished with 



eight points, while Bruce 
Erwin and Jim Morlan 
poured in seven each The 
scoring was complete with 
Schann Leathers scoring two 
field goals, and Lawrence 
Jordan, Charles Washington 



and Scott Reed contributing 
two points each. 

The Mastodons will host 
St. Francis in their next 
home game on Dec. 10 at 
7:30 p.m.

WE'RE HERE FOR YOUt 



Spirit abounds 



By JENNY BLAKLEY 

Sports Editor 
Fan support is a very 
important element in 
sporting events. The "home 
court advantage" or "'home 
field advantage" is 
traditionally mentioned 
when speaking of basketball 
or football games. The fan 
enthusiasm is often 
triggered by the spirited 
cheers heard on the 
sidelines. Cheerleaders help 
to get the crowd "into the 
game," which can often give 
the team a boost to victory. 

IPFW has a cheerleading 
squad, composed of five 
females and four males. 
Practice is held weekly, for 
four hours on Sunday for 
everyone and four hours on 
weekdays for "lifters." 
Sunday practices include 
various activities. "We 
dance, do our motions, 
cheers and chants," 
cheerleader Tiffney Gross 
said. 

The cheerleaders have 



irious reasons for joi 
the squad. Gross and Emile 
Durga said their interest 
began in middle and high 
school. "I was looking for a 
cheerleading squad at IP- 
FW, and didn't find one at 
first. Then I saw a sign 
(asking for tryouts), and 
tried out," Durga explains. 

Michelle Newbury felt a 
different motivation for 
becoming a cheerleader. "I 
felt the need to do something 
to get people to hang around 
campus," she says. 

The cheerleading squad 
also includes a mascot, the 
Mastodon. Andy Overmeyer 
is the man in the brown and 
furry outfit, who also is a 
regular cheerleader for the 
games "My fiance' and I 
made the costume, and it 
took a really long time I to 
makeit),"Overmyersays. 

The cheerleaders feel 
although the amount of 
support at the games has 
augmented from previous 
years, improvement could 




still be made. They are at- 
tempting to attract more 
fans to the basketball games 

working on a theme this year 
called 'New Attitude'," 
Darga explains "I am also

Lady Mastodons break even 



By GINA JONES 

and TON V DUN AWAY 

Staff Writers 

The Lady Mastodons 
defeated a much bigger 
Grand Valley Slate team, 67- 
66. The Lakers carry five 
players on Iheir team 
standingsix feet or taller. 

The Lakers, led by Rose 

Antrim's 24 point effort, look 
a 37-33 lead to the locker 
room at halflime and ap- 
peared to be running away 
with the game when they 
scored the first six points to 
begin Ihe second half. 

The Lady Mastodons 
began to make their 
comeback and closed the 
gap to 50-49 at the midway 
point in the half The Lakers 
then started to pull away 
again, and led 62-55 at the 
6:38 point when Terri Lydy 
left (hegamewithadeepcut 
on her forehead. During the 
injury time out. Coach Julie 
Calahan told the team "It is 
now or never ; it's your game 
to win or lose." 

The Lady Mastodons 
mounled their final charge. 
They were led by Michelle 
Foltz, who scored 19 points 
and pulled down 12 rebounds 
for the evening, but it was 
the defense and clutch foul 
shooting of center Clara 
Trowbridge in the final 
minules Ihat brought 1PFW 
back to within on epoint, 66- 
65. Then Bev Miller popped 
a 15-foot jump shot with 12 
seconds remaining for the 
game-winning points. 

In (heir next contest on 
Nov. 29, the Lady Mastodons 
dropped a hard-fought game 
to Central State. 62-60. 



execute nearly as well as 
needed, "Calahan says. 



Stephanie Bean, a 

sophomore guard on the 
team, describes the game, 
"It was a heartbreaker. The 
game was very physical. We 
could have handled it. but we 
didn't play at our level. We 
played (all their level. If we 
had played our game, we 
would have won," she 
comments. 



The leading scorers of the 
game were Michelle Fost 
and Lynn Minnerding with 20 
points and 11 points, 
respectively. The Lady 
Mastodons found themselves 
down by three points at 
halftime. In the second half 
IPFW went ahead briefly, 
but Central State took 
another quick lead. There 
was a chance to tie it in the 
end, but they couldn't get the 
ball in the hoop. 



Calahan says, "Central 
State played a very 
aggressive game, and the 
refs were loose on their calls. 
The aggressive play was 
very distracting. We didn't 
have a chance to run offense. 
We were worried about 
being hit and pushed. It 
ruined our concentration. It 
was a very physical game." 

The game was very 
frustrating for all, according 
to Calahan. Two of the 
Mastodons fouled out. and 
three players had four fouls 
each. During the course of 
the game, the Mastodons 
racked up twice the number 
of fouls as Central. 



The outlook for the rest of 
the season is very optimistic 
Calahan feels the team is 



getting better with every 
game, "We are improv 
My main concern right 



is the health of the players, ' 
shesays. 
The Lady Mastodons' next 



game is al home against 
Ferris State. It will begin at 
3 p.m. on Dec. 7.
