since I've been here (30 years). There 
arc so many aspects as lo why IPPfi'

looks lo die community as if we don't

According to McCants and 
Clausen, there ore several reasons why 
minorily professors have not stayed at 
IPFW. Many of them have laken posi- 
tions at other uoiveisitjes, moved wilh 
their spouses, failed lo meel tenure and 

"A program like vising minorily

Athletic director 
shares thoughts 
on Division I 
status at IPFW 



By Brian Milter 
Advertising ManjgiT 



On Sept. 18. The Communicator's Brian 
Miller sat dotvn with IPFW Director of 
Alhletics Walter Bowman and cleared the air 
ahout IPFW's move lo Division 1, 

BM: How would you explain Division I lo Ihc avBrogc 

person? 

WB: Division I is the highest level of NCAA coin pel ili 

As such in most communities, die fact thai you are 

Division 1 allows you die opponuniiy for greater visibil 

within Ihe community, ll allows you to reciuil a student a 

lele who wants to play at the very highest level, tl pern 

out student alhlctes to perform against 

student aUileles at Ihal very highest I 

level. Whether or nol wc win or ' 

whedier or not Uc lose is somediing we 

find out as we go down the road. From 

an economics standpoint, it has a 

tremendous impact becouse of Ihe type 

of teams and programs Ihal bodi we can 

go and play and we can invite here. Il 

changes the total dynamics of whu 

comes here. In Division II, very few 

people have probably heard i&gt;f [ 

Northern Kentucky or Wisconsin- Wall BOMfflan 

Parkside If they have at least heard ol I 

them, dial's all It means, but when sud- 
denly you are playing compelltion and it's Valparaiso oi 
" in. Evansville, Bowling Green, Duke or Indiana. Ihal 
changes things. Normally, people want lo see those pro- 
s, soil's going lo help us economically and it'

DM: Wilh all that said, do you Ihink IPFW can compcle 
on D DivLsioo I level? 

WB: Can wc go into die Pac-10 or the Big 10— Ihe answer 
no. We can'ldo dial! Are there conferences out there ihal 
: can go and compete in and play Division I? Assuming 
there are probably 25 to 30 Division t conferences across 
die country, once we are in Division 1 for a couple of years, 
not Ihe sun up years, hut against probably 12-15 of Ihem 
we c&amp;n hold our own. The reason 1 say that is because we 
number of opportunities (i.e. scholar- 
ships) that ihose programs have. Then, once we win a con- 
ference, we would be eligible for post -season play. Now, do 

team from Ihe Mid-Con play 
Final Four7 I would imagine probably not. The fact thai 
you arc able lo play in diem and bn'ng pni 
- ity and pride lo your school arc just irei 
lages. but I do think dial yes, we would not have mai 
'1 had nol felt that, 

BM: Why docs tPFW need Division 17 

WB: IPFW needs il in order lo really have a feel of 

complete university. Why does it need 
dorms? Why does it need a world-renown focully meml 
come? 1 think we need all of these diings to further nsund 
.out into what a university is. We're(IPFW) talking about

that. Except for one program, pnmaiily we're not

of that and we'll bring more history. We'll bring greater 
opportunities lo ihe university and il will bring a greater

leam in the country and also in my lime won Ihc National

Ihe iwomnnlh delay in Ihe appeal. The ivhole difference came about 
that were m the school year versus July Every coach will lell you Ihal 
IS Ihc difference. 

BM: Who's to blame for the iHO-monlh delay? 

WB; No one wants to play the blame game, [t would be easy lo say. 
'Well, if Ihe NCAA had given me Ihc approval in July, we w-ouldn'l 
have been silting here. They lumed us down. We appealed. There is no 
one to blame.' I'm not going lo Mame the NCAA and anybody who is. 
Ihinkmg correctly isn't gomg to blame anybody in here. Now if you're, 
going to question why we didn't allow Ihc moratorium to go. now thal's 
a dilferenl question, bul there is no blame. 

BM: The main losers of this move arc Ihc prcscnl sludcnl-alhlelK.;

Yoj said the student athletes and I disagree with Ihal. The general slu- 
dcnl-alhletes came here to go Division 1. They arc freshmen and soph- 
omores and that's what we're doing. In doing this move so late in the 
year, il has clearly disenfranchised some sludem-alhletes. No debate. 
No argument. However, you arc also going on the base and there is no 
easy wjy to say this, but if you want to say our teams silting here on 
Scpi. I S, 2000, have already made the playoffs, then 1 think your ques- 
tion IS very fair, bui if over the ne« three lo five weeks our record is

our Tifst year. Right now we are in very serious with Weber Slate and Wichita Stole who have expressed their desire 
(o play us at home Those are big names Ihal would never appear in Fon Wayne. Do 1 dunk Ihcy will draw belter 
than some other schools? Yeah, I do Ihink ihai, bul I ihink when we lalk about the big leam schools, at least ini- 
iially. we will be ptaying those away. 

BM: Do wc have contracts for Weber Sule and Wichita Slate? 

WB: No I think now it's juslo matter of deciding on a dale wc have both agreed lo play each Other. It's jusl set- 
tling on a date. Whal wc want lo do, in all honesty, is get the big names definitely in concrete and then wc have 
dates to work some of ihe others around. I would say over the neit couple of weeks you will see us hold a press 
conference for some of these teams ihat we are beginning to sign. Billy Gcmon (IPFW baseball coach) has just 
gotten a Big Ten school to sign on a Ihicc-day weekend. It's starting, il'S absolutely starting around here in terms 
of the type of difference a schedule is going to make. 

BM: In the past, the number one money maker and community support has been men's volleyball Is there 
pressure on Doug Noll to mnrkct his program (o become the number one money maker here at IPFW? 
WB; No, il'S no different. 1 would hope that Amic Ball and men's volleyball and what it's done here will caniinue 
to do Ihal and' continue to pack them in al diose cnUcal games. So. there is no more pressure on Doug than there 
is on Amic. The pressure is to build Ihe program lo such a degree thai it is very compclitivc so lhat people want to 
jecilandiiiin'iuploanybodythenlogooutlhercanddolheir very best. It's no different for Kcl ley or Terry. You 
want to go out there and gel the most aiuacuve schedules you can and he Ihc most competitive and you hope you 
offer the community something Ihcy want to see. 

BM: How does the coaching slalt feel about the move? 

WB: I can only go by die degree that all of the coaches I hired, during the process of hiring Ihem, we talked 
Division I and they knew where we were going, so thai answers itself. Certainly. Terry (Slefankicwici) hasloldme 
to my face that he wants to be Division 1. He probably just didn'i want it to happen this year when he had a sen- 
ior studded leam So when you ask bow Ihe coaches feel, I say. probably wilh the exception ofone coach, ihcy all 
want to rise to the challenge. I think we arc all disappoinled we won our appeal in August, when the school year 
staned, but I'm not aware ot any coach that has came to me with ihe exception of ore coach who said. "I'll sup- 
port it. bul I'm rather ambivalent." No other coach has come down here and said, "I don't want lo do Ihii." This is 
primarily because I hired all of Ihem and Ihey all knew il was coming, so this is something Uiey wanted. Timing is 
a dlfTerent issue, but clearly all of the coaches, and I've talked lo Ihem all. wani to be Division I coaches. 

BM: I^l's talk about Ihc liming. Why not wait for the two-year monltorlum? Why now? 

WB; We could have waited and maybe a year from now the NCAA, instead of having a two-year moratorium, sud- 
denly votes anodier eight-year moratorium. We were told by the members of the NCAA, in all honesty. Ihal Ihey 
couldn't tell if things are going lo change or not. We could have wailed, bul maybe Ihcy would have passed a new 
law that saidevcry member coming into Diviiion I has lo have 20,000 (students.) Maybe everyone has lo offer 150 
scholarships or maybe we don't want anyone foi anodier ten years. All of those things could have happened, had 
we waited. We know diat nghl now is Ihe lime and my personal opinion is thai the NCAA is going to make it real 
difficult over the neit two to ihrec years for any new members. Primarily, ihey do not want to have to add W the 
field of 64 ot other championship brackeus. I think they want to find ways for conferences lo combine and Ihey can 
le other types of things. I would be very surpnsed if. over the next five years, you sec ten schools join

this Division 1. Every year in late June, diey were hav- eome and see the new look in the nem 3-5 years and lo

Soccer teams roll past Hillsdale 



Coming inio Ihe Sept, 
Hillsdale, Assistant Coach Mike Harper said, Today Is 
going lo be a lot closer match. The men have improved 
greatly and diey have had some impressive scores. 
They losi lo some lop teams in our conference only by 
a goal difference. The women's team has been winning, 
as well. They are an improved team. Hopefully we will 
gel double victoKes today." 

Last year, the IPFW men's soccer team defeated 
Hillsdale College while die women's soccer team 
struggled againsl Ihem. This year, however, both 
IPFW'i men's and women's soccer teams were ready 
lor Ihe challenge, Tlie sunny weather, high temperature 

1, keep il and 

Braden Buder got Ihe Dons on die board first widi 
a goal coming only 10 minutes into die contest. That 
was just what the Dons needed to get diem rolling on 
the right track. Teammates Drew Lenhardl and Ian 
Luya each scored for the Dons. Luya netled two goals 
in die Dons' 4-0 triumph, 

"For the men, il was important to win because 
Ihey needed to have some fun. They have been strug- 
gling wilh this NCAA Division I diing and some ineli- 
gible players. We finally got oui goalkeeper back. All- 
American goalkeeper Jeff Richcy, and he is a take-con- 
liol kind ofguy. We got our first shul-Qui of Ihe season, 
everybody got lo play and diey had fun widi die game, 
to dial was imporum lo diem,' 

The womfch's team, which did nni liiiiriagc a vic- 
tory last season, came into this game looking lo pick up 
their second victory in only four games. IPFW goi on 
die board in a hurry as Shacina Hetsey scored die first 



goal of Ihe conlesl jusi two and half minutes into the 
game and later scoicd die game winner later that half lo 
put the Dons ahead. Goalkeeper Jodi Schnclkec had 
four saves and only allowed one goal as the team 
improved lo 2-2. Hersey, who scored her team-high 
third goal of die season, was complimenled by Head 
Coach Terry Slefankiewici. "She's a very good player 
from Massachusetts who should help lutnaround ihis 
program," 

The women played a team dial had five wins and 
only one loss, so the odds of us winning were not very 
favorable and lo beal diem 2- 1 was a bie win for out 
women's team. Il was one game in which the women 
possessed die ball mote diin die odicr team, played 
very hard and scored on a comer kick dial we had just 
put into our game plan-die fiist one dint worked per- 
feclly and that was our game winner. It was a very pos' 
itive ihing for die women and ihe men and hopefully 

will get two more viciories this weekend," added 
Stefankiewci, 

Although the Dons cannol compete in any posi- 
season toumimeni now because of Division 1 guide- 
lines. Coach Mike Harper said that the game was main- 
ly iiuponanl tor Ihc win/loss record, "We are in a pro- 
bationary period, so for two years our schedule is just a 
schedule ihal we keep track of die wins and losses, bul 
diere is no affiliation widi a conference and we cannol 
get into a posl-season play,' said Stefankiewicz, "TWo 
years from now. we will be in Division I and hopefully 
in a conference so Ihal we can get into an NCAA 

This past weekend, die men's soccer learn did
