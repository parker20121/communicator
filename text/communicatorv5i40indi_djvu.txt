Jacques Brel was born in 
Belgium in 1929. His early years were 
spent in the bitter atmosphere of the 
Nazi occupation. Following the war, 
Brel went to France and began 
singing in cabarets. His fame has 
grown through the years and he now 
plays to sold out houses in Carnegie 
Hall and similar concert halls in

Brel sings of the human experi-

own unique vision to both music and 
lyrics. It is this special quality which 
the PIT performance will capture and

Court decision 



Last weekend, the Student Supreme Court ruled that Tom Johnson 
was ineligible to run for Student Body Vice President. Johnson is 
currently taking only six hours and in the Court's opinion, the student 
constitution clearly requires nine. 

What was not clear is why the Un-Farty bothered to attempt to get 
Johnson on the ballot. The Elections Board ruled him ineligible and 
Johnson exercised his rise to appeal the ruling to the Court. The Court 
upheld the ruling by unanimous vote. 

One parly official argued that although the constitution does require 
nine hours, it does not specifically say "at the time of the election." 

Another argument was that the constitution hoped to keep 
unqualified people off the ballot by the nine-hour rule. Johnson was very 
qualified for the position because of his past work in the Students' 
Government; therefore, the clause was not meant to keep him off the 
ballot. 

Still another person said that Johnson would promise to take at least 
nine hours next year if he were allowed to run. 

The Court did nol think much of these or other arguments offered at 
the hearing, Its vote would indicate that. 

The Court's decision was a sound one. Although Tom Johnson would 
undoubtedly make an excellent vice-president, he just is not qualified at 
present to run for the office. It is a good sign that the Student Supreme 
Court is finally Jcciding cases on the b; sis of fact rather than individual 
prejudices, 



Genesis revisited 

A couple of weeks back when the (wo presidents were on campus at 
the invitation of the Ad Hoc Joint Faculty Steering Committee, much was 
learned about I he future of the campus. There was also an interesting 
piece of information divulged about the present state of things. President 
Hansen let slip the fact that the Purdue Business Office has some 2,000 
fiscal "details," 

As unbelievable as it may seem, the Purdue Business Office 
religiously follows 2, nun business policies and procedures to insure the 
safekeeping of university monies. This is the type of thing you always 
suspected to be true but were never really able to prove. 

The Student Senate and this newspaper can vouch for 1,794 of those 
"details." for that is the number we have been subjected to during the 
simple task of getting student activity money to the Communicator so 
thai it can be given free to all students. 

Last week we were promised exposure to the other 206 "details" 
before the matter is resolved. (Incidentally, we were told that more than 
likely the problems will be resolved by May, the month that classes end. ) 

One cannot help but wonder what goes on in Trom 5 that requires so 
much time to complete a simple task. This newspaper suspects that the 
big problem lies in Lafayette. The following example will illustrate: 

The form approving the transfer of funds from one account to another 
was lost twice, not just once, but twice, by Lafayette. The purchase 
requisition approving the concept of the transfer of money from the 
second account to the Communicator is being held up in Lafayette until 
the request to transfer funds to the second account from the first account 
is processed for the third time And the check request approving the 
actual transfer of money from the second account to the Communicator is 
being held up in Lafayette until the request to transfer funds to the second 
account from the first account is processed for the third time. And the 
check request approving the actual transfer of money from the second 
account to the Communicator is being held up here until Lafayette 
approves the purchase requisiton, which it is holding up until it approves 
the transfer of funds request. 

Confused'' The Purdue Business Office sure is. 

All of this is still happening in April when the Student Senate 
allocated the money on December 5. We wonder whether the Purdue 
employees receive their paychecks on time, 

Wefeel sorry for the local Purdue business officers who must justify, 
and at times apologize for the irrationality of their Lafayette overlords. 
None-the-less the problems will be with us as long as Lafayette continues 
to run the day-to-day affairs of this campus. Inside information we have 
received from a number of sources down state suggests that Lafayette is 
fighting hard to keep this control. 

Super-chancellor or not, merger or not, unless the strangulation hold 
that the Lafayette Business Office has on this campus is severed, our 
suffering will continue. We hope that this hold will be broken and broken 




Election brings 
abortion decision 



By CONNAUGHT COYNE 

Spring is surely here for 1974, 
ushered in by a spate of by-elections, 
almost universally viewed as bell- 
wethers for the 1974 Congressional 

The prospects are not encourag- 
ing if the special elections patterns 
hold true in November. Of four races, 
the Republican candidate won only 
one seat. That is not in and of itself 
necessarily discouraging, except that 
in all cases the Republican was the 
more conservative candidate. 

The Pennsylvania race was won 
by John Murtha only with the 
concentrated help of the whole 
organized labor establishment-and it 
was close. The Michigan race for the 
traditionally Republican seat of Vice 
President Ford was conducted by the 
Democrat, Vander Veen, on the basis 
of Nixon: "Impeach Nixon and make 
Gerry Ford President," was his 
theme, capitalizing on Ford's popu- 
larity in the district. 

The California race was won by 
Robert Lagomarsino, who was very 
popular locally, and had seven 
Democrats against him. Things would 
have been depressing indeed if one 
Republican hadn't been able to pull

Namath still chauvinist 



By AUDREY GILLIS 

Sometime ago, I wrote a 
magazine article in which I named 
Joe Namath as America's worst male 
chauvinist. I suggested, in irony, that 
the bragging quarterback, then 
known as Broadway Joe, distribute 
"Joe Namath Slept Here" buttons. 

Evidently, his managers took my 
suggestion seriously Joe Namath is 
now endorsing a line of sheets and 
pillowcases. They're called the 
"Playmaker Collection" and are 
distributed by St. Mary's, a division of 
Fieldcrest Mills. Advertisements 
show Joe between color -coordinated 
sheets. 

According to D.M.Tracy, pres- 



women, who do 95 per cent of bed and 
bath linen buying. 

Why Joe to endorse this product 
when admittedly all he knows about 
sheets is "I sleep on them"? 

"There are only about six men in 
America that women relate to, and 
Joe is one of them," Tracy bragged 
at a press conference, without 
revealing the source of his statistics. 
"We like his very believable life- 
style," the textile tycoon added. 

I don't know whether Tracy was 
referring to a magazine's report that 
Namath's bachelor pad purportedly 
featured "some of the unholiest 
debaucheries since Petronius' last 
house party" or to Joe's statement "I 
pray every night when I go to bed." 
However, if you want an inside look at 
other football players' life-styles, pick 
up a copy of Dan Jenkins' "Semi- 
Tough" (originally published by 
Atheneum and now in paperback as 
well), which according to the book 
jacket 'tells us more than we've ever 
known about the modern athlete and 



Taxes s 5,070 
per household 



According to the private, New 
York-based Tax Foundation, tax 
collections-federal, state and local-in 
the lasi fiscal year were the 
equivalent of $5,070 per American 
household, up S3O0 from the year 
before. $700 from the year beforethat 
and S2.G70 since 1960. 

The lax take in the U.S. has 
multiplied 1 1 times, going from a total 



personal income tax. corporate 
income tax, estate lax, gasoline lax, 
cigarette tax , social security tax, 
excess profits tax, property tax, 



The Tax Foundation figured thai 
the average American put in about 2 
hours and 40 minutes of a regular 

working day last year to pay his total 
tax bill-longer than he does to pay for 
food, clothing and shelter combined. 




the game of football." This is one of 
the rare occasions when a publisher's 
blurb can be called an understate- 
Fortunately, Joe Namath is not 
like his pigskin-minded colleagues. 
Here's his explanation of a woman's 
place in sports: 

"Before the Super Bowl, I went 
out and got this bottle and grabbed 
this girl and brought her back to the 
hotel and we had a good time the 
whole night. It's good for you. It 
loosens you up good for the game." 

Did the girl get thanked for the 
memory, if not for possibly saving the 
ball game? This is Joe's comment to 
the press after a chance encounter 
with one of his adoring fans. 

"Boy, that was a real memory 
job. You know, I only was with that 
girl one night., only one night with the 
girl and I come up with the right 
name. A real memory job." 

(At the Fieldcrest Press Confer- 
ence Joe was careful to announce he 
had a steady girl friend. And he 
remembered her name.) 

Another example of how " 



But how does Joe relate to women 
who are not romantically involved 
with him. like his employes? The Jet 
star demonstrated his heart of gold 
when as co-owner of the New York 
pub "Bachelors III" (an interest later 
relinquished because of alleged 
professional gambling presence) he

picketed outside. Joe partied inside 
Smilingly, Joe explained the firings to 
reporters: "We find that men do a 
real good job." 

Despite such antiwoman, anti- 
labor, antihuman attitudes, Joe is still 
the darling of the media. Time 
Magazine in a cover story glorified 
Namath as the all-American male 
referring to his "booze 'n' dames'' 
exploits with a leer more envious than 
critical. New York Magazine gave his 
injuries more coverage than those of 
war-wounded veterans, and Cosmo- 
politan ran an ad with this headline, 
"We make pantyhose for Joe 
Namath," 

Next to the photograph of an 
appropriately hosed model was this 
explanatory text: "They're worn by 
women, of course. But they're really 
made for men. Men like Joe Namath. 
who are turned off by tired legs. 
Legmen." 

You better not get varicose veins

Blocks access to 
parking records 



1 cannot stine a little chuckle. Abdul, when I think of 
pampered Americans doing without such fuel-consuming 
luxuries as busing, emission control systems, and 
electronic surveillance. 



By MAC HAMILTON 

Well, boys and girls, the Purdue 
University Accounting office is at it 
agin. My co-hort in crime, Kurt 
Ullman, attempted to wrench from 
the hands of that department certain 
records in relation to how student 
monies are being spent 
(HORRORS!). In relation to the 
trustees approval of lower parking 
rates for next year, KVU attempted to 
obtain the amount ol funds available 
within the account whence all of our 
parking fees went. A simple request... 
we thought. 

The logical place to start seemed 
to all to be the Accounting office. They 
are, after all, the ones who are 
charged with administering the 
aforementioned account. 

"So solly," she said, "boss not in, 
call back in howah." Call we did until 
finally we found (ta daaaa) THE 
BOSS! 

"What amount of money is 
available to us in the parking 
account?" we asked innocently. 



"Can't tell you, old boy, call the 
dean and director for access to those 
public records." 

OH BOY! 

We called the d&amp;d, and he was 
nice enough to let a reporter from the 
Student Publication find out about 
Student Monies. He explained that 

e things were just not to be given 



for refusing the public 
records of public interest. (We would 
like at this time to invite Mr. M and 
anyone else interested to the 
Communicator offices to look at the 
previously published payroll figures 
-from state records-for this campus 
or see back issues of the Indiana Daily 
Student for those un-publ;c records of 
the Bloomington faculty. 

So, as always happens, the petty 
bureaucrats were playing games with 
the PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO KNOW. 
I am forced to ask my old buddies in 
the PU Accounting office just one last 
question: vat is you hidink, fellas? 

Good night.... 



Ihinc- together .ig.iinst seven Dem 
The Ohio race is interesting i 



Thomas Luken, former Cincinnati 
mayor, and City Councilman for ten 
years, was running against Republi- 
can Willis Gradison, a Taft protege. 
Gradison was hardly conservative, 
though he did try to take the proper 
positions against wage and price 
controls and price rollback, in 
principle, whereas Luken opposed 
controls because they hadn't been 
handled right, and supported a price 
rollback. Luken capitalized on a crisis 
of confidence in government, of which 
Watergate was the leading symptom . 
Gradison brought in Jim Buckley to 
campaign for him. 

That was more embarassment 
than it was worth. Ohio Right-to-Life 
had sent questionnaires to the 
candidates enquiring their position on 
abortion, and various legislative 
recourses. Gradison, a Jew, gave the 
impression of being in favor of 
abortion. Luken, a Catholic, favored 
some kind of Constitutional amend- 
ment. Jim Buckley, of course, has 
sponsored a Constitutional amend- 
ment in the Senate. The press had a 
field day with Buckley-"You're 
against abortion, he's for it, why are 
you here working for him?" Buckley, 
being above everything a man of 
principle, did not waffle his anti- 
abortion position. Gradison said he 
hadn't actually made up his mind yet, 
but would later, like in November, 
when he stood for reelection. 
According to different campaign 
aides, the issue received fully as 
much press attention as the economy 
or the crisis of confidence. 

Luken was elected by a 4,000 
vote margin. It's hard to say how 
many of those votes were influenced 
by the right to life. Paul Scott, 
Washington columnist, estimates as 
many as 10,000 votes were influenced 
by this issue alone. It is probably safe 
to say it was a significant number, 
significant when you're talking about 
so close a race. Luken, of course, is up 
for election again in November, and 
Gradison is going to be his opponent 
again. By then Gradison may have 
reconsidered his position on killing 
babies. If he comes out with a position 
favorable to right-to-life, it will be a 
stronger indication than any debat- 

important 

Ohio has a particularly strong 
right-to-life organization, but in many 
other states pressure is being brought 
onto politicians to wake up on the 
issue. They're anxious to avoid it. A 
week or so ago, while voting on 
capilal punishment, the Senate voted 
without dissenting vole, to prohibit 
death penalty to a pregnant woman- 
out of the respect for the innocent life 
within her. Anti-abortion amend- 
ments of one form or another, of 
varying degrees of directness, have 
been put on different bills, and the 
elected representatives have gone 
through hoops to avoid a rollcall vote. 
On a few, rollcall votes took place, so 
that a record, albeit patchy, exists. 
Senator Baynh of Indiana has already 
felt pressure from right-to-lifers, in 
response to which he called the Senate 
Judiciary Committee hearings on a 
human life amendment. 

Right to lifers are not generally 
highly sophisticated politicos. But 
their motivation is high. End-the -war 
freaks and eco-nuts were not politicos 
when they started out, either (though 
the pro-abortionists of the '60's by and 
large were politically sophisticated.) 

All indications are that abortion 
will be an issue in the November 
elections, more than a heck of a lot of 
candidates would like it to be. If one 
feels any loyalty to James Madison's 
belief in countervailing "factions", 
however, one must welcome the 
appearance on the scene of active 
right to life political organizations. 
Elections are going to be close in 
November, 1974, and many of them 
are no doubt going to feature the 
throwing around platitudes, or wean- 
ing the cape of support for the 
impeachers or for the Trick. The 
injection of a very solid, very 
clear-cut issue into the races can help 
separale sheep from goats. It will at 
least be a real grounds for decision by

Dwight Henderson, chairman of Arts and Science, 
usually walks to school, some two miles from his house. 
However, on this particular wintry day there was a lot of 
snow left over and driving was in order. The Hendersons 
were having a party at 7:30 that evening. Almost everyone 
that came was prompt. Except the host. His car refused to 
strat or move a tire tread on the parking lot at 
school-making the host tardy, and the guests inquisitive. 
Eventually the history professor convinced the engine that 
revolution did not mean overthrow of the government all 
the time, and he made it to his own party. Maybe a set of 
snow shoes for winter wear would be a good investment for 
the walking professor who can always depend on his own 
power.

1974 MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL PREDICTIONS 

Baseball action has begun in the major leagues, and it 
looks as though there should be some fair divisional races 
this year. 

The Oakland Athletics have captured consecutive world 
championships, and it remains to be seen whether they can 
make it three in a row. I say they won't. 

Cincinnati is highly favored in the National League, but 
they have failed in the clutch every other year in the recent 
past", so why should this year be any different? 

In the Senior Circuit, I look for the St. Louis Cardinals to 
be the surprise of 1974, while Los Angeles should edge out 
Cincinnati with their abundant youthful talent. 

Joe Toree, Lou Brock, and Bob Gibson make a fine 
nucleus for a competitive Cardinal squad, which has been 
very disappointing the last several seasons. This year they 
should take their divisional title and the National League 
pennant as well. 

Their stiffest competition will be coming from New 
York and Pittsburgh. The Mets probably have the best 
pitching staff in the National League, but their hitting is 
below par, and I don't think they will be able to luck out 
another divisional title like last year. 

Pittsburgh can look very impressive with its hot bats, 
but they lack winning pitchers, and are extremely 

The Cubs will be lucky if they don't land in the cellar 
this year. They have an inadequate and unproven pitching 
staff, and they foolishly traded away a half dozen of their 
best hitters and their top pitcher Jenkins, who threw a 
one-hitter at the world champion A's in his American 
League debut. 

Montreal could be the darkhorse of the eastern division. 
They have several fine hitters and several fair pitchers. It's 
difficult to predict where they might land. 

Philadelphia is fair, but no more. 

San Diego could very well be the surprise of the 
National League West, as they have acquired some solid 
hitters. A line up with Beckert, Colbert, and McCovey can 
hardly be ignored. But their pitching isn't much, so even 
though they might make it out of the cellar, it is probably 
safe to say they don't have a chance of beating out Los 
Angeles and Cincinnati. 

San Francisco and Houston are about equal. Both are 
very unpredictable. Both are supposedly capable of winning 
their division, but I'm afraid that both will probably be in 
for a long year. Even though they both have the talent to 
win, recent past results tend to discourage any miraculous 
performances for this season. 

Atlanta has a slugging lineup led by none other than 
"Hammering Hank", but their pitching is poor, poor, poor. 

Over in the superior American League, which outhit 
and out homered the National League and took the World 
Series as well, there are going to be plenty of surprises. 

Look for Boston to sweep up all of the marbles in the 
East, as they have added tremendous strength to their 
pitching staff with the acquisition of Wise and Cleveland. 
With solid hitters like " Yaz" and Carlton Fisk, they should 
be able to nose out the Orioles. 

Baltimore has some very good young talent, but I have 
a feeling that injuries are going to hamper them this year. 
Brooks Robinson and Boog Powell are still around, and they 
still have a potent pitching staff. 

Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, and New York will all 
be fighting to stay out of the cellar. The Indians could easily 
pass the other three, if the Perry brothers are effective this 

Detroit has half of its team receiving retirement 
benefits, while Milwaukee has a weak pitching staff. The 
Yankees are capable of taking it all, but they won't. Look 
for them to finish at the bottom. 

Beware of the Minnesota Twins in the American 
League West. They won 14 out of their last 18 games last 
year, and have added several strengths, the most 
prominent being the acquisition of catcher Randy Hundley. 

A good year by Harmon Killebrew will more than make 
up for any weaknesses on the mound. The Twins have the 
power and the hitting average (as they led both leagues in 
team batting last year with a .270 team average.) Bert 
Blyleven is considered to be the top pitcher in the majors by 

Oakland will again be tough, but they still need a few 
better hitters. Jackson can't carry the full load. Their 
pitching is very solid. 

Kansas City, Chicago, and California will all be fighting 
for the title in what should be the tightest race in both 
leagues. The winner from this division will again win 
everything. 

Kansas City has plenty of speed, Chicago has the power, 
and California has a little of each. 

Texas has a much better pitching staff with the addition 
of Jenkins, but I think it will be another year or two before 
they become real competitive. My picks follow:
