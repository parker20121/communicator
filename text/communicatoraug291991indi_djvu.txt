New child care center 



EduCare provides improved services 



Kelll E. Beery 
Copy Editor 

H you d'ive past il. you can'l miss Jl. 
With Immense crayons holding up Ihe 
awning, the building was obviously built 
with children in mind. Il is Ihe new 
Children's EduCare Center. 

EduCare provides services 'or chil- 
dren ol sludenis, lacully and slalf Irom 
IPFW, Ivy Tech, Fori Wayne Develop- 
menlal Center and Parkview Memorial 
Hospilal. 

The whole idea lor a child-care center 
started back in 1971. according to Alice 
Frazeur Cross, direclor of EduCare. 
Students who wanted more lor their 
aclivlty-lee dollar started Ihe center lor 
children ol IPFW sludenis. The center 
was housed in Ihe IPFW's only build- 
ing: Keller Hall. 

Five years ago, the center reopened 
Its doors 10 more ifian IPFW. II 
became a consortium and, along with 
IPFW, included Ivy Tech and Fori 
Wayne State Oovelopmental Center. 
The consortium included only state 
agencies, and il wasn't required lo 
have a license because one state 
agency cannol require licensure ol 
another state agency, according lo 
Cross. 

Bui then Parkview gol involved when 
IPFW and Parkview merged their nurs- 
ing programs. Parkview Hospilal 
joined the consortium, and EduCare 
now has lo be licensed lor ihis year. 
But Parkview gave EduCare something 



else: a new building. 

However, the relationship among Ihe 
organizations is not one-sided. Cross 
slaleed, ^One ol the things I really want 
lo emphasize is Ihe mutual relation- 
ship, Ihe commonality, among Ihe 
users. We have such a large portion of 
people, students who are in the nursing 
programs, in radiology al Ivy Tech and 
respiratory therapy, who are all stu- 
dents, and they need childcare, and 
they are hired by Parkview. Or people 
working at Parkview are taking classes 
al IPFW or at Ivy Tech trying to 
enhance Iheir educations. It really 
works well together. The same for Ihe 
Stale Oevetopmenlal Center.' The 
stafl there takes classes at IPFW or Ivy 
Tech, also. 

EduCare's basic cornerstone on 
which it was formed, according to 
Cross, is to provide service lor the peo- 
ple whose schedules are not 9 lo 5. 
'We are trying to address a population 
of people who are taking classes in a 
variety ol ways or who are working 
unusual shilts," said Cross. "The just 
don't III Ihe 9 to 5 mold that mosi day 
cares have a flal-week fee for. Those 
centers that have a llat-week lee can 
usually penalize Ihem per-hour; we're 
trying lo meet their needs.' 

'People don'l have lo be using us all 
the lime. There's no minimum amount 
of time. They can use us one day a 
week or two hours a week,' staled 
Cross, 

Meeting the users' needs includes 



hours from 6 a.m. lo 12:30 a,m,, serv- 
ing on a lull-time, part-lime or drop-in 
basis, capacily (or 197 children, educa- 
tional play toys, daily activKies and les- 
son plans put into use by 16 teachers, 
nine assistants and approximately 40 
student employees, 

Loii Hunt, an employee al Parkview, 
explained why she picked EduCare, "I 
was really excited that the lacilily is 
going to be so close lo Parkview. I'm 
hoping to get opportunities at my 
lunchlime lo come over and spend time 
with my child. That's one ol the main 
reasons and another reason is I really 
feel liite it's a safe environment. 1 have 
a nine-month-old and he's al Ihe point 
where he gets into everything but 
doesn'l understand what 'no' means 
yet, and so I'm afraid to have him at 
home, especially at someone else's 
home where I don't have any control, 
but I like Ihe fact that I can come in al 
any time and see what the facilities are 
like, I'm please with Ihe hours, I could 
bring him in at night if I don'l have a 
babysitter. They seem to be really llex- 
ible," 

Is Ihe stall well-equiped (or the caring 
ol children? Cross commented on their 
training, "The regulations require 12 
hours a year, but they should gel more 
than that. For instance, everybody 
coming on now is getting a huge train- 
ing in leims of CPR, first aid, curricu- 
lum, guidance and discipline, commu- 
nicating with parents, and documenting

Fine Arts prof honored 

Sculptor's medal inducted into Smithsonian 



By Tina Holslon 
Editor In Chief 

When Hector Garcia, associate pro- 
lessor of line arts, created his Flame 
For Freedom medal, ha had no idea 
he was creating what would become 
his most merited work. The bronze 
meda! has recently been inducted 
into the Smithsonian Institute's per- 
manent collection as well as Ihe 
American Numismatic Society's per- 
manent collection ol coins and 

The medal is a bronze design ol 
meial plate bolted togelher into a cir- 
cle creating a containment, but with 
an opening in Ihe center where a 
bold llame bursts through. Garcia 
describes the piece as a "jail where 
the flame representing freedom is 
never completely imprisoned, 
because people's wills cannol ever 
be completely broken." While he ts 
proud o( the accomplishment, Garcia 
said jokingly. "Thai's a lot ol mileage 
out of one piece ol sculpture.' 

Garcia, a professor at IPFW since 
1966, was born in Manhattan and is 
a graduate ol John Herron School ol 
Art in Indianapolis. He began his 



sculpting as a young boy living in 
Puerto Rico. "I started modeling with 
candle wax,' he said. "My grand- 
mother had many votive candles 
around the house and when (hey 
melied down she gave me the wax.' 
He began by making miniature fig- 
urines and animals and learned to 
work with clay later when he moved 
back lo Ihe United Slates with his 
parents. . 

'1 lived in Ihe South Bronx until I 
was 12 years old," said Garcia. 'But 
that IS a pretty rough area and I end- 
ed up moving lo Indianapolis to live 
wilh my father' 

Garcia said he was lucky because 
his grade school and middle school 
art teacher really cared about Ihe 
sludenis. 'Thai teacher encouraged 
me to go to Ihe best high school lor 
art in Indianapolis. There I gol to try 
oil painting, figure drawing, sculplure 
■ everything, and that helped me gel 
a scholarship to Herron.' 

Garcia had no intention ot teaching. 
After earning his BFA he weni to 
work for a Iriend who owned a art 
shop. "We did whatever people 



asked of us,' he said. "Sometimes 
Ihe requests got really strange, but 
we did it. The rent had lo be paid." 

But in 1956, he learned of a small 
college in Iowa which was looking lor 
someone to teach. "They were pay- 
ing for the trip out and back, for Ihe 
mierview, and meals, so I went. 1 
began teaching there Ihe following 
fall." While at Ihe small college. 
Clarke college. Garcia said he 
learned to "hustle to get commis- 
sions." "On the salary I was making 
and wilh two kids I had to do some- 
thing." Garcia's wife, Carol, is also 
an artist. She is a painter who also 
volunteers with set work al Fort 
Wayne's Civic Theater. 

"In 1963, I began sending out let- 
ters lo other colleges lo find a better 
position, but the ones who respond- 
ed required a master's degree. It 
was then that I decided I either had 
to return to school or continue lo 
struggle where I was," Garcia was 
accepted into Indiana University. 
Bloomington's MFA program and 
spent 2 1/2 years there completing 
that degree and assisting the cera-

New I.D. cords 



Technology brings campus up to speed 



By Kelli E. Beery 
Copy Edilor 

Did you see the table set up outside 
ol the Bursar's office alter you paid 
your tuilion? Did you slop at Ihal 
table? If you didn'l. you missed your 
first opportunity to pick up the new stu- 
dent ID, 

Sporting the IPFW logo, the student's 
name, and a bar code on Ihe front and 
a magnetic strip and a "Fall '91" stamp 
gracing the back, the new card is ready 
lo be used in a variety of studies. 

Starting immedialely, Ihe card will 
replace the year-old copy card, accord- 
ing to Krishna Frazier-Henry, She also 
stated that the new card would replace 
the library card. 

Now you can minus those cards Irom 
your wallel. Bui whal else will the card 
be able lo do? Frazier-Henry said 
plans are in the working to program the 
cards, by using either the stripes or bar 
codes. Frazier-Henry said the pro- 
gramming should be done by this 
spring. With Ihal accomplished, Ihe 



card can be used at SAB events and at 
Ihe Alhletic Center. 

When asked why the newcards were 
needed, Frazier-Henry replied, "Tech- 
nology, There are a lot ot universities, 
il you look at Ball Slate, Purdue and 
U.U,, they all have a card similar lo that 
(Ihe new card) where il has a magnetic 
strip on it lor students lo use. In lad, i 
know al Ball State students use this 
card to vote for their student govern- 
ment members. They have whal looks 
like ATM machines and they are able 
lo put Iheir cards in,,. That would be a 
neat way to do rt around here, then stu- 
dents wouldn't have lo be here al 2 
p.m., but they could do it al 10 at 
night." 

Implemeniing Ihe card wasn't a quick 
decision. According to Frazier-Henry, 
Ihe Student ID committee was loimed 
18 months ago. It includes repiesenta- 
lion from the administration faculty, 
stafl and students. The committee is 
headed by Paul Strouts. director of pur- 
chasing. 



Some people might be asking why 
there isn't a picture on ihe IronI ol the 
new 10, Right now Ihe cards cost 
520,000 compiled by Students' Gov- 
ernment, the library. Printing Services, 
the vice chancellor lor academic 
affairs, the vice chancellor lof financial 
affairs, and the vice chancellor lor stu- 
dent affairs. If pictures had graced Ihe 
new 10 card. Ihat would have meant 
another S25,000 for the cards, accoro 
ing to Frazier-Henry, 

Are there any big projects planned for 
this card? Fiazier-Henry stated that 
futuristic goals for Ihe card include 
uses with Follelt's Bookslore, The Fori 
and vending machines on campus. 

Try not to lose your new card, 
because as always, replacements wilt 
cost $2,00, Right now new cards can 
be picked up at Ihe Union Operations 
'Office in Walb Memorial Union from 8 
a.m. to 10 p.m., Monday through Satur- 
day and noon to 10 p.m. on Sunday. 
In order to receive a new ID card, stu- 
dents musi their tee statements. 



Biology department gets new chairman 



By Mark Harl 
Stall Writer 

Whal do the following have in com- 
mon: snakes, guitars, and last name 
Cooper? Well if you were thinking ol 
Ihe lock star Alice Cooper you were 
wrong. William E. Cooper. Jr.. was 
appointed chair ot the department of 
biological sciences this year at IPFW. 
Though he may have a lew lings in 
common wilh Alice. Iheir differences 
arelar and wide. 

Even though Cooper has just started 
his job as chair ot the department, his 
goals lor Ihe scfiool are already in 
motion, 'Two very important items Ihal 
I would like to change would be to 
reshape the department so that stu- 
dents whose major is not in biology, 
bui would like lo apply some aspect of 
it lo Iheir studies could lake a course 
wilhoul going through the regular pro- 
cess," He mentioned a student in pub- 
lic relations Ihat would like lo take ecol- 
ogy in relation to environmental affairs 
Currently, this student would have to 
take all the prerequisites before taking 
thai course. Cooper said his other goat 
was to expand some courses. He said 
that those courses would not just be 
small areas of interest, but have ihe 
potential of being majors. 

Cooper also put inio motion plans for 
a new building to hold the biology and 
chemistry departments. He said, "The 
plans for the new building should be 
done by December." 

Cooper's arrival al IPFW Irom Auburn 
University at Montgomery. Alabama, 
may seem like a big change, but to 
Cooper It's nol. He admits lo some 
minor differences, bui he said 'I am 



pleased to be wilh a college that has a 
wide variety ol student ages," 

When it comes to research and study. 
Cooper is very interested in visual cues 
in reptilian social behavior. His main 
animal of study is the broad-headed 
skink on which he has conducled many 
experiments. Showing a proud photo 
he had taken of two skinks during mat- 
ing season, he described them as a 
medium-sized lizard wilh an unusual 
broad head. He said animal behavior 
has always been his favorite area even 
though he has taught many different 
courses during his 15 years al Auburn 
University. 

Beside doing the research. Cooper 
has published more than 80 articles 
since 1971. When asked what journal 
he is most proud ol, he eagerly 
responded "ihe latest one.' He plans 
to contribute an entire chapter ol his 
life's study lo a reptilian documentry 
book. 

When he is not publishing his own 
work he receives many journal articles 



from colleagues requesting input from 
Cooper on their work. He said he 
reviewed about 50 last year, but this 
year it was less because ol his busy 
schedule. His family occupies a good 
portion of the busy schedule. When he 
isn'l studying reptiles in the islands off 
of South Carolina, or by the border of 
Texas, he enjoys reading, swimming 
and guitar. He and his wile have three 
children: a 19-year-old chemical engi- 
neering student at the University ol 
Cincinnati and two daughters who are 
2 and 5. 

Cooper's work in the lield ol biology 
has not caused him lo join any ot the 
environmental groups, but this does 
not mean that Ihe isn't involved. He 
said that even though most of the 
classes he has taught are from a sden- 
tific background, he does bring up 
social environmental issues in class. 
He slated Ihat he has each student do 
a 20- mmule report on some environ- 
mental issue on a local level so Ihey 
can relate lo it.

Homophopia 

Americans should not 
discriminate against gays 



Th9 Uniled Slatos is a nalion that 
hales its gay men and ils lesbian wom- 
en, Homosexuality is a sin, gay Ameri- 
cans. II not a sin, homosexual lowe is 
one ol the lotlowing: a sexual 
deviance, a perversion, unnalural. a 
crime, a menial illness, a histoilcal or 
personal phase, or a national bligtit. 
You know the names too: llamor, 
queer, dyke, bulch. ludge-packer, bull 
trull, bull dyker, buH buddies, homo, 
lesbo. 

The mass media telts us homosexu- 
als are something lo be guarded 
against. From a television commercial: 
A ring ol cowboys srI around a camp- 
liie. One is eating a bowl of cereal. 
Another asks ol him, 'Whaicha eating, 
partner?" He replies, "Nul n" Honey." 
All ol the covirtwys jump in unison and 
pull Iheif guns on the unassuming one. 

The mass media does not say. how- 
ever, who really needs to be guarded 
against. A recent Village Voice stocy 
reported that m New York City's popu- 
lar cruising strip lor closeted gays, a 
homosexual was beaten on the avei- 
age ol one per nighl by violent homo- 
phobes. 

The homphobla mote widely known 
In our area is ol a more controlled 
nature. For those who may be won- 
dering, homphobla is an irrational lear 
ol homosaxualily and homosexuals. 

Homophobia is a learned behavior. 
As children, we saw our parents react 
to a symbol, a gesture. A casual Hip ol 
the hand earns a smitk Irom Dad. 
Mom says. "That's sick," when the Vil- 
lage People dance on the Tonight 
Show, They remind you that God 
says, and the preacher says, that 
homosexuality is an abomination. By 
the lime you were eight or nine years 
ol age. weren't you playing iag lag" 
and "smear the queer?" You knew 
then what lo do with a gay person. 

By adulthood, halted ol the gay and 
lesbian is so ingrained it has become 
physiological , A 1981 study (ound het- 
erosexuals showing a tightening of skin 
and a fluting ol eyes when they were 
told they were speaking lo a gay man. 
A larger portrait ol hatred is formed 
when Americans are polled on their tol- 



erance ol homosexuals. One-third ol 
the Americans in a 1985 survey said 
they would not 'Allow an admitted 
homosexual to make a speech in their 
community." 40 percent said they 
would not want a book favoring homo- 
sexuality to resi in their community's 
library. 25 percent ol the people 
"strongly objected" lo working with a 
gay or lesbian, while 22 percent said it 
should be legal lo keep people Irom 
jobs and housing if they are homosex- 
uals. The popular picture ol the homo- 
sexual as a seducer ol youth holds fasi 
according tot he poll. A whopping two- 
Ihirds of those polled believed as gay 
should never be an elementary school 
teacher. Would such a question ever 
even be considered for another minori- 
ty group? 

Our impanial media leeds the hatred 
ol homosexuals. Gay and lesbian poli- 
tics and relationships are rarely seen in 
news programs, but drag parades. 
AIDS deaths and child molestations 
are lead stories. Vt/hen was the last 
lime you heard a public service 
announcement lor a gay group on the 
radio? Imagine Doc West saying, "The 
Gay-Lesbian Task Force on Violence 
will be meeting on B p.m. Monday 
nighl. ..and now, a Guns N' Roses two- 
teron Rock 1041,' 

None (he less, lesbian women and 
gay men are everywhere. They are 
with you in the work place. They nde 
beside you on the bus. You chatted 
with a homosexual belore class yester- 
day. 25 million gays and lesbians live 
In the United Slates. Thai &lt;s one in 
every ten Americans. 

Dr. Kinsey told us in the 1950s that 
one of every three males displayed 
homosexual tendencies. Yet we all 
spout names and jokes and place gays 
and lesbians beneath serious con- 
tempt. A teenager was seen on Wells 
Street the other day wearing a shirt 
wdh "AIDS kills fags dead* printed on 
it. 

You would not stand still, were such 
abuse leveled at you. Keep your reli- 
gious beliefs if you wish, bul people 
shouldn't turn lo violence, discrimina- 
tion and hatred. Our society can't bear

Writer agrees with letter from lost issue 

To the Editor; cd nr nnl Ihi^ ic^ ti nnod idea Renale Iron In uia the well-traueled tunnel to vni 



To the Editor 

I was surprised and please with 
Renate fuloore's editorial leller last 
spring She suggested that a rock be 
placed outside Walb Memorial Union 
as a canvas lof gratliti artists to display 
their opinions and/or talents. This 
would be done in the hopes o( avoid- 
ing some of Ihe deslructive graflili evi- 
dent on our campus. 

Whether destructive gtahiti is avoid- 



ed or not, this is a good idea. Renate 
lold ol a bridge at Indiana University 
and a rock at Kent Slale where stu- 
dents may "vent expressions of Ihe 
soul " I have a third example. North 
Carolina State University is divided by 
a railroad line, so Ihere are tunnels 
under the tracks which connect Ihe 
campus. The most central ol these 
tunnels is called the Free Expression 
Tunnel. Anyone, not only students, is 



Iree to use the well-traveled tunnel to 
communicate. I saw frat parly 
announcemenls, political commentary, 
obscenities, artistry, and student actwi- 
ties updates, among other things. 

There were maintenance cosis lor 
the tunnel though. On one occasion, I 
saw workers removing inches of lay- 
ered paint inches of effort and though! 
and hope and hale and dreams. 
Sometimes you can'l fully express 



yourself in a sanitary, (ype-wrilten tel- 
ler to the editor. At leasl three schools 
(eei that there is a need for a less con- 
ventional outlet. An oullel where your 
passions need not be distilled to black 
and while, but displayed with all Ihe 
color and imagination ii deserves. At 
leasl two students, Renate Moore and 
myself, (eel a need for such an outlet 
at IPFW.

Sexual questions 

Children must learn early about contraception 



Kelll E. Beery 
Copy Editor 

The present question asked of the 
educational system is not what should 
children learn, bul how? One example 
is sex education. Students need lo 
know about il, but should they be 
taught by stressing abstinence or by 
teaching the use of contraceptives? 

Some people believe that abstinence 
should be taught. 11 abstinence is cho- 
sen then people can work on Ihe back- 



Commentary 



bone ol their relationships. 

Relationships are composed of two 
pans: emotional and physical. The 
emotional pan must come first lor a 
mature relationship. If this cornerstone 
is allowed to mature and love forms, 
Ihe relationship can live through almost 
any trouble. 



The problem appears when the physi- 
cal ponion lor the relationship is put in 
gear loo soon. Some people mistake 
physical attraction for emotional love. 
According to one theory, physical 
attraction is just one step in a 12- step 
process leading to a love relationship. 
I'm nol saying thai Ihe physical part ol 
Ihe relationship is wrong. I'm saying 
thai the physical pari ol the relationship 
alone does not produce a healihy rela- 
tionship. What happens il disease or 
impotence affect the physical relation- 
ship? Since Ihat is all they have, how 
can iheir relationship continue? 

A Iriend of mine just had sex lor the 
lirst time. What does she know aboul 
her partner? He's gorgeous, likes to 
play tennis, has a 3.0 average, and 
takes out Ihe trash every Saturday. 
They are both 22. And she thinks she 
loves him. They haven't even known 
each other lor more than a monthi I 
believe she is contusing physical 
attraction lor emotional love. 

II adults can be so immature to not 



know the dilference between physical 
allraction and love, how are children 
supposed lo be mature enough to 
know? They don't. Abstinence would 
be Ihe best answer. 

But there is the issue ol having inler- 
course anyway. The problem ol AIDS 
and other sexually-transmitted dis- 
eases is always present. So rf children 
mess up Iheir lives enough by having 
sex. they should know about conlra- 
ceptives to prevent more obstacles. 
Lei me stress, however, that Ihe use of 
contraceptives doesn't equal sale sex. 
Nothing but abstinence is sale and 
(oolproof, 

I sat through a sex-education presen- 
tation in lounh grade and took heallh in 
high school. What do I know about 
contraceptives? Absolutely nothing. 
However, if there are children running 
around with the same amount ol con- 
Iraceplive knowledge as I have, who 
are having sex, something needs to be 
done. And that something is to leach 
children the use of contraceptives. 



Many parents are opposed lo this 
fad. They say Ihat teaching children 
about contraceptives will only give the 
children an interest in actually having 
sex. I disagree. There are two kinds 
of children: those who are going to 
have premariia) sex and those who 
aren't. Statistics now say thai the split 
is 50/50, and Ihal may be low. 

Apparently, Irying lo scare children 
into choosing atislinence isn't working. 
Some will still have sex. Back to my 
22-yeaf-old Iriend. she was ol Ihe 
mind-set Ihal she would nol have sex 
until she was married. Guess she was 
wrong. She told me thai she (ound 
herself ready. Whatever that means. 
She never thought about Ihe 'scars 
tactics; like diseases or pregnancy. 

H children believe they are ready lor 
sex, Ihe inlormation they need better 
be right In front of them. If children 
choose abstinence, they can jusi 
ignore Ihe inlormation or file it way for 
later. Let them take their pick, bul h 
must be taught.

Hey, new students 

•The Walking Tour of IPFW serves 
OS enlightening instructional tool 



As lh)s academic year begins, a new 
crop ol Iresh-laced students can be 
s8Bn wandoting through Iha halls ol 
IPFW, These rookie Mastodons* can 
be Ideniilied by (he way ihey check and 
doubla-check their class schedules. 
Sometimes Ihey can even be spotted 
scanning the handy IPFW campus 
maps in search ol Nelf Hall* or soma- 
placa. 



Mbtruse Mnglei 

By iim Walker 
Managing Editor 

As a service lo these Incoming fresh- 
men, freshwomen and Hanster slu- 
denis, the Obtruse Angle staft has 
assembled 'The Walking Tour of 
IPFW,' This is an inlolaining s1ep-by- 
step tour ol the important places and 
things on our lovely campus. 'Once 
new students have completed Ihis 
walking tour, they should be able to 
stride conlidenlly through the Geo-gar- 
den past the Life Sciences Resouice 
Center* and on over to the new Fine 
and Performing Arts Building" and they 
will know alt of Ihe way where the heck 
they are. 

'Also, all of the words noted with an 
asterisk (*) in this introduction are so 
noted because they will appear again 
during "The Walking Tour ol IPFW" as 
important slops. The words "also" and 
"once' are not noted with an asterisk 
(■) for this reason. "Also' is so noted 
because il is the lirst word in Ihis 
explanatory paragraph concerning Ihe 
use ol the asterisk ('). "Once" is noted 
(') because it is a run-on sentence. 

'For Ihe youngsters reading this, run- 
on sentences ate not popular with the 
W130 and W131 English instructors 
you may now have professing lo you 
here al IPFW. They, the prolessors, 
would surely prefer a sentence like 
this: The ozone layer depleted at a 
rate of 32 percent during the last 20 



years. And so on. 

Now for -The Walking Tour of IPFW.' 

STOP ONE 

Because this is not "Tho Driving Tour 
ol IPFW we will not deal wilh the line 
roads or ellicieni parking areas on 
campus. Bui Ihe lour must begin 
where most students start their days al 
school, walking Irom a lot. I most enjoy 
parking near the river on the west side 
of campus. Somelimes after a long 
day of classes I will stop by my car and 
grab my fishing pole and casi out into 
the Si. Joseph. I've never actually 
caught a living organism from the St. 
Joseph River, but I lind peace by relax- 
ing on Ihe bank. 

And one of these days a body is 
going to float by. I just know it. 

STOP TWO 

Alter leaving Ihe parking area, the 
student's lirst stop is Kettler Hall, This 
is the looming building shaped like a 
distorted plus sign (-i-). In Kettler Ihere 
are Mastadon bones on display. A 
Maslodon is a now-eniincl hairy ele- 
phant. It is also the mascot of this 
campus. So, as all Purdue students 
are Boilermakers, all IPFW students 
are hairy extincl elephants called 
Mastodons, hJeat. 

STOP THREE 

There may be more interesting stops 
inside Kettler, but after you see the 
Maslodon bones, only nature's beauty 
is a suitable follow-up. This can be 
found al the northeast side of Kettler 
Hall. Here we find the Geo-garden, 
The rocks have names. Between the 
rocks and the sidewalks are various 
lypes ol Indiana vegetation. Take 

STOP FOUR 

After leaving Ihe garden by its north 
side, Ihe student should turn to Ihe lelt. 
There is the Life Sciences Resource 
Center. On a quiet day an attentive 
sludenl can hear the shrieks of dying 
rodents as enperimenters find oul if 
intense electric shocks kill rabbits. Or 
somelt^ing likelhat. 

STOP FIVE 



Across Ihe grass from the Life Sci- 
ences Resource Center lo Ihe east is 
Nefl Hall. I've only been in there once 
to have my teeth cleaned by a student 
studying dentistry. Nefl Hall is Ihe 
building where engineers build levers. 
And so on. 

STOP SIX 

By walking diagonally for the north- 
west corner of Nelf Hall, a student 
would bump into the Physical Plant, 
home ol our crack campus police force. 
While you are there, pay your parking 
ticket. I'm sure you've got one by now. 

STOP SEVEN 

East of the Physical Plant is Ihe much 
beloved and colorfully named Class- 
room Medical Building. Ttie highlight 
of CM. as we cagey IPFW veteran stu- 
dents call it, is the exciting MTV area. 
In this lounge students are olten hyp- 
notized by the flashing colors and 
dancing darlings on the screen. Some 
studenis have been seen holding their 
eyes half open, without blinking, lor 
seven straight hours. 

The Classroom Medical Building also 
features lull length mirrors in the 
reslrooms. 

STOP EIGHT 

Walking easi from the MTV room in 
CM, studenis will exit lo see Helmke 
Library. Inside are many clever com- 
puters and other aids to help students 
lind sources for research papers, 
Unlorlunately, an estimated 67 percenl 
of all sources suggested by the com- 
puters and other aids are not available 
in Helmke Library. Or something like 
that. 

Every new student must spend some 
time in the smoke-filled library lounge 
on Ihe lirst lioor. This is what college is 
all about: talking philosophy, eating 
donuls, talking politics, drinking Moun- 
tain Dew, talking elhics, smoking Marl- 
boros. This is it. 

STOP NINE 

North ol the library, across the vast 
cement courtyard, is Wait) Memorial 
Union, In this great building. Ihe insti- 



luKons ol Students' Government, the 
Greeks, and The Communk^tor are all 
housed. Don't miss The Forte Cafete- 
ria on the ground floor. Concerning the 
Forte, only two words are needed ■ lin- 
er foods, 

STOP TEN 

Beyond Ihe union lo the north is the 
creatively monickered Multipurpose 
Building, One may ask "How many 
purposes does this building serve?' 
The only answer is many, many. In 
this building a student could enjoy a 
violent game of pick-up basketball, 
drop a heavy load of weights on his or 
her chest, and then run around the 
track to complete hours ol fun. And to 
top it all off. a student can lake a show- 
er in the Multipurpose Building. And 
soon. 

STOP ELEVEN 

All that's left aller Ihe Athletic Center 
is Ihe new Fine and Performing Arts 
Building. I've never been in there and 
I'm not sure if il is even finished. It 
would be nifty to visit il it was only hall 
finished and exposed live wires were 
around for unsuspecting visilors to 
touch. But that's only a fantasy. Such 
is life. 

THE END 

So this is the end of our "Waling Tour 
ol IPFW,' Hopelully you have learned 
much through Ihis exercise. *t learned 
myself as I wrote Ihis, while walking 
through our campus, that every time I 
stop and look around I see something 
new and interesting thus it makes each 
trip through IPFW a Iruitlul one, 

'The preceding sentence was again a 
run-on sentence. I should have pre- 
ceded this entire column with an aster- 
isk (*). as it is pretty mush one big run- 
on sentence. 

Again W130 and W131 English 
instructors delest run-on sonlances 
and thus would surely detest Ihis col- 
umn. They would surely prefer reading 
instead a brief fn-dass writing assign- 
ment eniitlad "About My Self by Leo 
Bender, freshman. 

And so on.

Music review 



Rappers fail to entertain 



By Chad Hasting 
Features Editor 
Friday. Aug. 23, saw a first lor the 
Allan County Memorial Coliseum. A 
package tour featuring Redhead King- 
pin, King Sun. and Terminator X 
became the first rap concert at thai 
venue. M.C. Hammer and Rob Base 
had both performed al the smaller 
Foellinger Theater In years pasi, but 
Friday's "Back lo School Rap Concert' 
finally tirought hip-hop Indoors. 

In ihe past year, three black music 
shows featuring Ray Charles. Boogie 
Down Productions, and Pebbles {with 
Father M.C.) have fallen Ihrough due to 
problems with promoters. The Califor- 
nia gangster lapper Too Short was 
originally slated to appear at Ihe top ol 
Friday's bill, but putted out ihree weeks 
before the concert. Nevertheless, the 
show went on despile poor promotion 
and slow lickel sales. Respect goes 
out to Bonanza Bar-B-Q, a black- 
owned, soulh-slde business tor simply 
getting the acts lo Ihe stage. 

To be Iruthlul, 'slow ticket sales' is an 
understatement. The first thought that 
went through my head when I saw ihe 
crowd was "How did they pay Ihe acts 
their liont money?" Only 150 people 
attended, a number Ihat seems very 
small inside the cavernous Coliseum. 
With so few people there to absorb the 
sound, the lesutling acoustics were ter-

ribis. At one point during the Termina- 
tor X set. I heard an extra drumbeat not 
tailing in time with X's music. Then I 
realized Ihat the snare beal was echo- 
ing oti the back wall of the Coliseum. 

Two lame local ads led Ihe show off 
with lilteen-mlnute sets each: White 
Sensation and J.T. and the Fellows. 
White Sensation look like they stepped 
straight out of Carroll High School lor 
the show. Spiked hair, baggy leans, 
Ray-bans. The deejay even wore a 
cashmere sweater with chinos and a 
baseball beanie. These kids were liv- 
ing proof that -Yol MTV Raps" isn't 
entirely beneliciat to hip-hop music. 

J.T. and the Fellows couldn't help 
mailers much. Rapper J.T. was 
rhyming out of lime with D.J. Julio's 
beals in each of this Ihree songs, and 
Ihat was really annoying. D.J. Julio, 
however, had done his practicing. On 
the last song, he jazzed the crowd with 
his behind-lhe-back scratching. 

When Public Enemy's Terminator X 
took the stage with lemale rappers 
Bonnie and Clyde, I moved down front 
and got ready tor some real hip-hop. 
Alas, these three didn't deliver either 
Bonnie and Clyde yelled al the crowd 
to shout and scream and gel busy, but 
no one moved, not even through their 
current hit, "Homey Don't Play Dal." 
Frustration with Ihe sparse crowd was 
probably what led X to stalk off Ihe 



stage after only a tlfleen -minute show. 

That left il up lo King Sun to save the 
concert, and he did. As demonstrated 
by his record's title. Righteous But 
Ruthless. Sun tries lo divide his words 
into hall Alrocenlric rhetoric and halt 
street stories. From the time he look 
the stage, he was Mr. Nice Guy, and 
he won Ihe crowd over completely- 
Decked out in everyday Lakers gear 
and biker shorts, he delivered his entire 
show down in Iha security pit. It was 
the logical thing to do; Sun could rap 
right into everyone's laces down front, 
while his height allowed him to be seen 
everywhere. His Afrocentric directions 
in "Be Black" came olf as a lace-to- 
lace talk to the crowd. When Sun 
started his hips grinding during his 
brand new song "I Don'i Want lo Sex 
You Up," the teenage girls near him fell 
all over each other, screaming. He 
made no reference lo how small the 
crowd was, instead choosing lo per- 
form lor everyone of them, one by ore. 

Redhead Kingpin and his crew, Ihe 
FBI. closed the show. Redhead opted 
to slay onstage lo accommodate his 
limber, frenetic stage movements. 
Alter his first song, he sized up the 
crowd, then said halfheartedly. 'It's a 
small crowd, but luck all ol Ihem Ihal 
didn't come away." Pause, then as an 
afterthought, 'Cause we're having a 
party here, right?" Unlortunalely. he

Music review 



Prickly like a pear 



Elvis Coslallo's Mighty Uke A Rose Is 
jusi ihai: attodive and carefully cutti- 
vale, yet wrih a thorny reality beneath 
ths beauty ol its petals The music 
evokes images that ate olten quite dH- 
(QfanI I'om - even in conlrasi to - what 
the lyrics are depicting. Costelio uses 
Ihis contrast as a vehicle lor proving 
liffl at the end of the 20lh century is 
more prickly than the Images oF oidl- 
nary pop songs. 

This passionate album. Costello's 
13lh. combines densety-woven lyrics 
with a variety ol musical styles to ae- 
ale beautiful and petpleicing effects. 
This just may be Costello's best work. 
It is also his most sprawling The 
album employs rhythm &amp; blues, pop, 
and Kadilional Irish folk music as well 
as an orchestra and a sultry Spanish 
guitar. But the compositions are exe- 
cuted with such expertise and precision 
they seem deceptively simple. 

Costello sings ol bve, hate, pair&gt; and 
disgust with almost cathartic power. 
You feel the satisfaction that the leels, 



as if justice has been done, as il by his 
singing about them the phonies have 
been expose, the martyrs canonized, 
the criminals condemned, and the 
lovets lamented. This makes Mighty 
Like A Rose invitingly rich and mysteil- 
ous. 

The album begins with 'The Other 
Side of Summer,* a bouncy pop tune 
that [uxtaposes Beach Boys backing 
vocals with lyrics about ecok&gt;gical and 
social disaster, h's easy to find your- 
self guiltily singing along with ris cheer- 
ful chorus. 

On "How To Be Dumb,' Costello 
purges his anger and disappointment 
toward ex-band member Bruce 
Thomas, who wrote an unflattering 
memoir about his years the the Atlrac- 
tions. Costello uses a controlled but 
pounding beat and sharply sarcastic 
lyrics: "Now you've got yoursell a 
brand new occupation/Every Heeling 
thought is a pearLcAnd beautrluf people 
stampede to the doorway of the funni' 
est fucKer in the world,"

Costello also attacks the pop music 
industry from inside with *lnvasion It 
Parade." He infuses a melodramatic 
Beatleslsh melody with lyrics that 
evoke a Red Army invasion. The song 
lashes out at pop music's creators and 
warns listeners who don't buy in that 
they will be "mopped up" with "all the 
stubborn ones who just refused lo be 
saved." 

Costello mocks a rite of passage of 
the British upper class in 'Harpies 
Bizarre." The formal sound of a cham- 
ber orchestra underscores the 
depressing tale ol a debutante ball: a 
teenage girl loses her virginity to some- 
one who is merely using her. 

Many of the remaining cuts are unlra- 
ditional love songs {or love-hate 
songs). The couple in Ihe melancholy 
'After the Fair stay together only for 
satisfying, uninhibited sex, and in the 
rollicking "Georgie and Her Rival," an 
abusive pair are more addicted to psy- 
chodrama than lovemaking In other 
numbers like "So Like Candy" (cowrit- 
ten with Paul McCartney), the music 



actually reinforces the tyrk^. The slow, 
pleasing, blues tune seems to savor 
each note like a chocolate kiss while 
the tyncs are those ol an abandoned 
lover who is leh with nolhing but wrap- 
pers of the Candy he once enjoyed. 

Pushing his voice to Ihe limit. Costelk) 
slides into a melodic falsetto; a low, 
enthralling breath of sound (on "Bro- 
ken"); and a barely conlrotled scream. 
In 'Sweet Pear,* a love song of the 
purest devotion, the high end of his 
vocal range evokes both elation and 
despair. 

This record seams to be a proving 
ground for Costello - he's proving he 
can sing with heartfelt emotton a^ well 
as savage irony. Unlorlunalely, some 
ol his lyrics are nearly Impenetrable. 
They leave you feeling left out, as if 
you missed the punchline ol a good 
joke. However, the problem doesn't 
really get in Iha way ol the pleasure of 

Costello may be prickly, but he is a 
beaul.

PIT review 

Earnest succeeds at switching gender roles 



By Marcl Copsoy 
StaH WfHflf 

Honesty is never the best policy; it's 
just so terribly dull. So PuFdus-lndiana 
Thaaler's production of "The Impof- 
lance of Being Earnest' wends its way 
through Osca' Wilde's comedy ol man- 
ners by broadening the playwright's 
snicker at Victorian propriety to a (ull- 
bbwn giggle. 

Thus Lady Rupert Reginald Cyril 
Bosie Douglas Williams III (that's right), 
played by Miss Prism (Wayne 
Wiiliams), graciously oilers to wtiile 
away pfe-curtain tedium by singing and 
playing on a harpsichord ■ her lavorHe 
numbers Irom Gilbed and Sullivan. 

This is where the giggling begins. 
The dear lady is not a lady al all bul ■ 
gasp - a man in drag. And yes, he/she 
Is really playing the harpsichord and 
singing, sorl of. Assuredly, Lillian Rus- 
sel can rest easy. 

The giggles become guffaws when 
the audience realizes all of the female 
characters are played by males, and 
males are portrayed by females. 

On the surface, this works very well. 
Gwendolen (Jason Fulk) is MutI to 
John Wonhlng's (Lisa Anne Haram) 
Jelf, They are incongruous as lovers, 
and Wilde would surely approve ol 
director Laurence L. Life's tongue-in- 
cheek casting. 



On a deeper level, Wilde would shed 
tears of jo/ at Life's sensitive handling 
of the duality and tragedy hinted at in 
Ihe play itself As Algernon, piayed by 
Joni Nadenen Evans, tells Jack, -All 
women become lilte their mothers. 
Thai is their tragedy. No man does. 
That's his,' Like Ihe characters in this 
play, people olien assume false faces 
to gain acceptance. 

Jason Fulk and Dana Metzger. who 
plays Cecily Cardew. make excellent 
young ladies. Fulk has the required 
feminine sealing posilion down pat 
(knees logelher, ankles to the side), 
while Metzger lolds his hands and, 
very properly, keeps them still. His 
walk is smooth and ladylike, never 
bouncy, while he genlly twists a wisp of 
hair. 

But Haram's John is no slouch either. 
She struts about the manor house 
quite convincingly and sits like a true 
man: knees apart, feel and elbows 
out, taking up the requisile one and 
one-hatf spaces. 

Becky Niccum, as Ihe Rev. Chasuble, 
musl be nearly two feel shorter Ihan 
her "sweelheart," Wayne Williams 
(Miss Prism), bul this adds to ihe 
incongruity of Ihe satire. She's not 
quite as manly as Haram, but Niccum 
makes up in energy what she lacks in 
masculinity. 



Kendra Clauser's costumes are eftec- 
tive, Algernon's striped pink suii sug- 
gest the roguish dandy, and Cicily 
boks all Innocence In her modest gown 
of creamy yellow. But Gwendolen's 
(ussy blue gown and John's Ihree- 
pisce black suit (ell a siory that's tar 
from innocent. Perhaps the honorable 
Gwendolen is not so honorable after 
all. 

Steven T. Sarratore. scenic and light- 
ing designer and chair of the theater 
deparlmenl, solves the problem of 
scenery changes with panels of chain 



link. Irom which hang a table and 
chairs and even a tea cart. These 
become "pegboards; that look like 
wicker and allow Lane, Algernon's 
manservant (played by Jefl Moore), lo 
make hasty and, at leas! lor Lady 
Williams III, annoying scene changes. 

While duality of character is certainly 
not new lo the theater, director Lite's 
use of gender switching to portray this 
adds zest lo an already astringent 
comedy. Now. if only Lady Williams 
would sing more numbers from "H.M.S, 
Pinafore,*

College Access Channel 6 

Production assistant contest finalist 



Jim Everill, junior, radio and television 
major, had finished his last exam ot the 
spiing semestet but his day wasn'l 
dono yel. Evenll still had to put in an 
eight-houi shiH al Channel 6, IPFW's 
college-access cable station- When he 
got lo his desk, however, he had a sur- 
prise wailing lor him. There was a let- 
ter in my mailbox telling ma I was a 
Homelown Video Feslivai finalist," tie 
remembers, 't was psyched. It kept 
me pumped for Ihe rest of the shrtt." 

The Homelown USA Video Feslivai is 
presented yearly by the National Fed- 
eration ot Local Cable Pfogrammers. 
Evetill's entry, a 3 1/2 minute piece 
tilled -IPFW Ofienlalion Video; Pto- 
gfam Promos' was one among 2.063 
submissions form public-access cable 
talewision systems in 38 stales. 

The annual compelilion is sponsored 
by such cable induslry heavyweights 
as CoK Cable Communications, the 
Arts and Entertainment Network, and 
3M Professional Audio Video. This 
kind ol success is not new to Everill, 
who was a finalist in the 
■ In struct ional/Tralning" category In the 
t989lesiiva1. 

Thirty-year-old Evenll is a production 
assistant lor Channel 5 and lives in 
New Haven, Television is the medium 
he has chosen to work in exclusively 
lor (he pas two years. As production 
assistant, he prepares program tapes 
tor airing, dubs music and sound onto 



promo spots, and programs Iha auto- 
matic lape changer, among other tech- 
nical duties. 

These technical talents come as nat- 
urally as his creative ones, "f^y dad is 
a computer programmer.' says Everill. 
'He used lo work in the Auburn court- 
house. He taught me not lo be afraid 
to push buttons. I learned how to play 
Hangman on a S40.000 machine.' He 
brought that same curiosity lo work for 
college -access television. Channel 6 
director, Bernie Lohmuller said of Ever- 
ill, 'Jim's learned a k)l in a short time. 
Technical work is a laleni, and most 
people don't have that skill." 

Everih's "IPFW Orienlation Video' is 
aimed at freshmen who are MTV kids; 
the cuts are quick and jumpy. The 
images Ihal fly past touch all the bases 
ol IPFVJ student lile, bookstore 
searching, a model skeleton, a scene 
from PIT'S "Curate's As You Like It.' 
hands raised, volleyball sets and 
spikes, all get a look. Marking the 
quick cuts al regular intervals, howev- 
er, are long, graceful shots ol the cam- 
pus as a wtiole. conslruciion of the 
parking garage, and masses of walking 
students, ft is those pictures that bring 
the fragments together lo a whole. An 
animated IPFW logo Mils Ihe screen 
(created lor ihe clip by Channel $ ani- 
mator. Nelson Eddy) to bring the video 
10 a dose.

tapes for footage, a process that look 
nearly three months to complete. He 
searched all his 'College Update' news 
videos, picking through "anything and 
everything' to find the shots. The night 
before Ihe 1990 Ireshman orienlation 
began. Evenll lound himself still latior- 
ing away on Ihe music edit. Fortunate- 
ly, he got up early enough the next day 
to waich his video do its work. "It got 
lots of applause, I got lots of comments 
on how good it looked." The lape was 
viewed by 2,000 freshmen. 

W/hafs in the future for Everill? Al 
present, he is concentrating on two 
goals: bringing a new 'College 
Update' news show to Channel 6 
screen twice a month, and a new pro- 
duction. "On Stage.' The idea behind 
this show is lo take new plays, 
rehearse them with a student director, 
then block them for the Channel 6 stu- 
dio. "On Stage' is still a long way off 
according to Everill, "My basic difficulty 
is in keeping within everyone's sched- 
ules. ' After graduating Everill plans lo 
slay in Ihe Fort Wayne area producing 
local broadcast media, or perhaps 
working tor an industrial video house; 
he is not quite sure yet. 

Of one Ihing Everill is conlident' 
"After the radio and TV degree is com- 
pleted, then I'll be back to get a com- 
puter degree,' he said with a small 
smile. He'll be back punching buttons 
again.

He Ihen weni lo Franklin college to 
loach sculplufo and dfawing, but Gar- 
cia was sMl not sallsfled. That was no 
program fof me. Most of Ihoso stu- 
denia weren't going lo be sculptors, 
Itiey were going lo leach elementary 
school art. They didn't need my 
Inelruclion." So when ihe Fort Wayne 
Alt Inslilule (now the line arts depart- 
meni ai IPFW) decided lo hlie a lull- 
lime sculptor, ha applied for the posi- 
tion and was hired. 'That was in 1966, 
then In 1976 lUPU took over- 
He now teaches sculpting classes in 
Ihe newly linished Fine Arts building. 
He en|oys teaching because, he said. 
"H is a successful person whose job Is 
dealing with what they like. I'm teach- 
ing what I love. I gel lo watch Ihe stu- 
dents evolve and I also learn liom 
them. To me Ihat's exerting.' 

When he and his students are not 
evolving logolher, Ga/cia works on his 
personal sculpture projects which are 
almost entirely commissioned works. 
"I'm not a gallery artist, everything I do 
belongs to someone else.' He said it's 
very dilficuil to categorize his work 
because he does so many different 
things. 'Sometimes I work in traditional

development as well as their regular 
personnel policies,* 

Let's not lorgel aboul the children. 
What can they expect at EduCare? 
'Every child deserves love and 
respect,' explained Cross, "We use 
principles of early childhood education 
in planning activities to writing the les- 
son plans to guide us because what 
you do wiih a two-year-old has lo be 
right lor a Iwo-year-old, We look at 
kids as though it's going lo work. It's 
going to be positive. It's going to be a 
good experience, not negative. 

'If your child walks through Ihe door 
and we say, 'Uh ohi' it's slarlad out in a 
bad way. No, we don'l do thai. We 
have a very specific routine of applying 
steps lo situations lo walk Ihe way 
through so that children's needs can be 
met, and so we can address Ihe srlua- 
lion tiefore rl becomes a problem,' stal- 
ed Cross, 

Also offered to ihe children are huge, 
spacious rooms for daily activities, 
playrooms fuil of toys, and a backyard 
with rugged oulskJe equipment. Cross 



images - figurea, and sometimes in the 
symbolic or abstract. I'm sort of like a 
line craftsman trom medieval times. 
They took great pride in their work and 
all ol them worked for commissions," 

In fact, he said, every period in art, 
except modern has been based on that 
concepl of a responsible arlisl working 
lor technical and aesthetic perfection. 
"They give 150 percent and that is an 
artist not a workman. I do my work that 
way too because if you have made it 
come into being and if you gave less 
than 120 percent you have lo live with 
thai.' While he admits thai his works 
are not always exactly perfect. Garcia 
says he is olien happy with his work. 
'Many people argue that doing com- 
missioned work Is whoring," he said. 
"But I completely disagree. II that is 
true Ihen all ol art history would be 
thrown down the toilet, because 90 
percent of artists prior lo the 19th cen- 
tury did solely commissioned work." 

Garcia said he is thrilled by the chal- 
lenge ol having someone say this is 
what I need* and coming up with some- 
thing that has never been done before. 
'H I can create a design thai I can be 
happy with first, Ihen the client likes, 
that's a happy arrangement." 

Garcia Fias done commissioned 



vrarks lor many inlernationat, national 
and kical groups and indivkJuals. His 
work includes a sculpture titled "Native 
American" which was commissioned by 
the Nonhside Sister City committee 
and was presenled In Takaoha, Japan 
In June ol 1989; a bronze sculpture 
commissioned by the Martin Luther 
King, Jr. Living Memorial, Inc. which he 
presented in Washington. D.C: ihe 
designing of the official medal for the 
Slate of Indiana National Bi-Cenlennial 
Celebration in 1976: and a Chlel Little 
Tudie 1 0-loot bronze sculpture whch is 
in Ihe Fort Wayne Visitor's Center, 
Several notable people have a Garcia 
original in their collections like Ted 
Turner. Ray Bradbury. Herbie Hanax:k 
and Karl Haas. These are all in addi- 
tion to the medal designs which were 
chosen lor exhibition in the 50th 
Anniversary convention ol the Interna- 
tional Society of Medalisis. one of 
which is Ihe Flame of Freedom medal 
for which ha won acclaim. 

The Flame of Freedom was surpris- 
ingly not a commissioned work, Garcia 
says he was inspired by his depression 
and anguish over Ihe oppression and 
struggle ol blacks in South Africa. 
'Sometimes the only language is 
imagery lo express that kind of grief.* 



'Alter Ihe piece was first exhibited, all 
hell broke loose in Eastern Eunape and 
it was suddenly more broadly applica- 
ble," Garcia was asked by the medal- 
ists society to not only exhibit Ihe 
piece, but also to preseni a new cast- 
ing technique he had developed, at the 
convention, From Ihere it all look oH 
tor Garcia's medal. Within weeks the 
American Numismatics Society had 
written aboul acquiring a medal, and 
then the Smithsonian. 'It took aboul 
two weeks lor il all to sink in' he said. 
'II all happened so fast and then a few 
weeks later I suddenly realized what 
had happened. It was like the com- 
mercial on TV." Garcia explained, smil- 
ing and slapping his palm to his fore- 
head In mock "I could'va had a VB" 
style, 

Garcia is not resting on this achieve- 
ment however: his work currently in 
progress includes 12 liturgical pieces 
for the Gesthmane Lutheran church 
and large sculpture lor a (amity home 
in Sycamore Hills, 'But,* said Garcia, 
'al leasl after working seriously for 30 
years, I have two pieces of real merrt." 



said, "All Ihe equipment is selected to 
enhance learning. Children are learn- 
ing through play. We organize play 
experience so they get those basics. 
They get language, ihey gel relation- 
ships, they gel science and numbers, 
and all those diflerent skills.* 

The center also leatures a library for 
both Ihe children and teachers. The 
library can be used for reading, special 
presentations or lor showing lilms on 
Ihe screen built into the ceiling. 

Parkview may have provided the 
building but money is still needed for 
loys and salaries. Students' Govern- 
ment allocates $27,000 a year to the 
center. According to Cross, they are 
very grateful. 'We could not exist with- 
out that. If we didn't have that, rates 
would be substantially higher per hour,' 
said Cross. 

There are a couple of things thai 
need to be done before children can be 
enrolled in EduCare. 'If parents want 
lo use our services,* said Cross, they 
should call the center, bring Iheir class 
schedule and their employment sched- 



ule, and fill out the request for child 
care," 

Then the center must check lo see If 
it has a spot open during the needed 
time. II it does, Ihe parent musi attend 
an enrollment interview, which is a 
meeting that details the policies and 
procedures of EduCare, When all is 
linished enrollment can begin. 

Cross stressed the llexibility of Edu- 
Care, 'Parents can use us lor full time, 
part time and drop off. So, lor 
instance, if a student is working, but 
they are taking a class at night at 
IPFW. they can use us full lime. If we 
have students that are taking classes 
but need additional lime lo go in and 
work on the computers or lo go work 
on a group project, they can call us up 
il they are enrolled and ask, 'Alice, do 
you have exira time for drop-ins Irom 
10 to 1' and I go through and count my 
staff and say. 'Yes, we can" 

Anolher advantage ol using EduCare 
is its location very close to IPFW at 
2125 Beacon Streel. EduCare's phone 
number is 463-6132 il there are any 
questions.

Lady Volleydons reach for lofty goals 



By Mark Donaldson 
Sports Editor 

Lolly goals yield grealor towards. 
And a longer season. 

Thai Is head coach Lisa Sheehan's 
philosophy for Iho IPFW women's vol- 
Isyball learn this season. 

'Our goal this year is lo reach the 
finals of the NCAA tournameni,* said 
Sheehan. "We want lo sol our sights 
on more than jusi making the field,' 

IPFW was shut out of Ihe NCAA tour- 
nament lasl season despite a 25-9 
record and going undefeated in the 
Great Lakes Valley Conference. 

'An otiiclal Irom Ihe (NCAA) setadlon 
commlllee told nne we didn'l have a 
lough enough schedule,' said Shee- 
han. 



Thai V: 



I not be an Is; 



a this s 



as the Lady Volleydons face their most 
ambitious schedule ever, competing In 
three tournaments and meeting 12 
opponents ranked in last season's top 
20. 

Eight returning players, including four 
seniors, boosi Sheehan's confidence 
lorlhelask. 

'Al Ihe end of last season we talked 
about wh3l we had to do to gel ready 
lor this year.' said Sheehan. The kkJs 
worked reaify hard over the summer 
and came back ready lo play.* 

The returning seniors are Denise 
Scheumann (5'10'). Wendy Vander 
Wilt (6'0'), Janna Plumer {6'0'), and 
Kristin Gorsline (e'C"). 

"Janna and Kristin have Ihe ability to 
be part of the tallest and sirongesi mid- 
dle combinations In our conlerence.* 



said Sheehan. 'Kristin has made the 
most improvement of any player ihal 
has ever passed through her. We're 
going to couni on her (or many things 
Ihis season. 

"Denise tias become an extremely 
elfjcient defensive specialist and has 
woiked hard on her outside hilling, and 
Wendy has one of the quickest arm 
swings m the league and should be 
one ol the most tenacious right-side 
hitters in Ihe GLVC." 

Also returning are junior oulskle hit- 
lers Julie Huber (S'S') and Temple 
Swoverland (5'9'}. 

'Temple and Julie are two of the 
hardest hitters in Ihe league and are 
capable ol being the besi passers in 
the conference as well.' said Sheehan. 










Huber and Swoverland led Ihe team 
in kills lasl season with 378 and 377. 
respectively. 

Two sophomores return for Ihe Lady 
Volleydons. outside hitter Joy Thayer 
(S'lO") and setter Jilt Lyon (5'6'), 

Lyon IS being counted on to fill the 
shoes left by Kris Wilder, an all-conler- 
ence and all-region seller who com- 
pleted her eligibility last season. 

"Jill has come to this program wilh 
more experience than any setter we 
have ever had." said Sheehan. "We 
have been real pleased wdh what she 
does lor us offensively. We're looking 
for her lo grow Into Ihe lloor leader Ihal 
we need.' 

Newcomers this season are Ifeshmen 
April Saer {5'9'), carol LaMarr {5'3'), 
Yvonne Weber (5'9'), and Shannon 
Smith (5'8'). 

Also new to the team this season are 
Bonnie Cannell (G'O"), a junior originally 
recruited al Ball Stale, and Sandra 
Riera, from Puerto Rkxi. 

'Bonnie has been a pleasant sur- 
prise," said Sheehan. "She Is Ihe 
strongest kid on the team and could 
dominate the blocking slatislics in the 
GLVC 

With lofty goals and a tall, experi- 
enced team, Sheehan is ready to start 
the season. 

"We've got lo hit Ihe ground running,' 
she said. 'It's a lough schedule, but 
it's a good team. We're ready lo go out 
and knock some heads wilh Ihe big 
boys and see how we come out.* 

The Lady Volleydons begin their sea- 
son at Hillsdale College on Tuesday. 
On Sept. 6 and 7 they will participate in 
the Northern Michigan Invitational in

Soccer team optimistic about season 



10), Dan 
190), Man 
tSO), Ryan 



By Mark Donaldson 
Sports Editor 

A solid nudaus of retutning playars 
and an upgraded 25-man losler have 
lueled coach Troy Rusblng's opiifrism 
Tor the coming soccer season. 

'I Ihink wd'rs starting this season at a 
higher skill level.' said Rushing. 
'We've got a real good group ot kids ' 

Reluming lor the Maslodons are 
seniof Brendan McCormach (defender, 
6'3'. 180 lbs.) along with juniors Huo 
Andrews (delender, 6'4' 
Roman (defender, 6'2', 
Parker (delender, 5'10', 
Jagger (mld-llelder, 6'5' 
Kevin Jahrt (defender, 5'10". 155) 

Parker was the only IPFW playo- 
named lo the All-Creal Lakes Vaiiey 
Conlerence team last year. 

Three newcomers were singled out 
by Rushing as expected contributors 
lor Ihis season. 

'We're looking for (Mi-^' 
Hollingsworth, (Ryan) Hayes and {Nh- 
Bogenschutz to provide someollen;i.^&lt; 
punch," he said. "They've looked 
good In practice.' 

Hollingswonh (forward, 6'!', 200) was 
all-conlerence lor IPFW In Ihe 19B8 
season and has returned lo the team lo 
complete his eligibllily. Hayes (lor- 
waid. S'T. 155) is a freshman from 
Mtshawdka, and Bogenschuiz played 
al Division I Holsira Ui^iversily last 
year. 

Olherlhan Jose Rivera (goal, 5'10', 
165), who is Irom Puerto Rico, all the 
players are Irom Indiana. This Is by 
design according to assistant coach 
Mark Coffee. 

"We did a lot ol recruiting in Fort 
Wayne and Northern Indiana and 
picked up some real good players,' he 
said. "The skill level in Ihe Fort Wayne 
area has elevated recently and there 
are enough talented players to support 
the colleges in Ihe area.* 

A roster lull ol talent is beneliciai in 
practice noted Ihe coaches. 

"The players have to make an adjust- 
meni lo the college game,' said Rush- 
ing. "It IS a more physical game. More 
bumping, more pushing off the bat). 

*A higher level o( laleni In praclice 
means our players will be more pre- 
pared for Ihe season.' 

Rushing hopes a tough schedule, 
including several Division I opponents, 



will prepare Ihe learn for Ihe GLVC said. against an alumni learn at 2 p.m. on
