bers in just five minutes. "

guidance and leadership." 

Philip Gutman, president pro 
tempore of the Indiana senate spoke 
of Broyles' part in the growth of this 
campus, "Although you have never 
put I.U. above cooperation, as we 
move ahead, we can continue to be 
proud of I.U. You have not abandoned 
the I.U. badge." In Fort Wayne you 
have stood for I.U. There may be a 



Frank Jones, executive secretary 
of the Indiana University alumni 
association, then spoke about Ralph 
and his wife Kay's dedication to the 
alumni association. He announced 
that the alumni association is having 
cast a Ralph Everett Broyles medal 
that will be presented every year to 
an outstanding alumni as a living and 
continuing tribute to Broyles. 
He also announced that the Allen 
Countv Alumni Club had been named 
Club of the Year. 



John Ryan, president of Indiana 
University, then compared the 
lation of words on the I.U. seal, f 
wisdom and beauty, to Ralph Broyles' [ 
own objectives. He said, "This is 
certainly the finest campus in 
Indiana." He then said, "Ralph was 
always there and I shall never forget 
it. I have never had a more steadfast, 
a more loyal colleague than Ralph." 

Broyles was the last speaker. He

enough to do a testimonial for, and 
you're not clinically dead enough to

He commented, "He \

Jeanne Miller, trustee of Indiana

She said, "As a representative of the

Unification to be delayed 



By MARK FRANKE 

The unification of I.U. and 
Purdue at the Fort Wayne Campus 
appears to be delayed even though the 
new super-chancellor is scheduled to 
be in officed by Julyl, 1974. 

This unwelcome news came 
during an open hearing sponsored by 
the Ad Hoc Joint Faculty Steering 
Committee President John Ryan of 
I.U. and Purdue President Arthur 
Hansen answered questions from the 
"ommittee during the hearing. 



Search board 
has news leak 



The Chancellor Search and 
Screen Committee has a leak and its 
members would like to know where 
that leak is. 

The Journal-Gazette yesterday 
published a story that reported how 
two candidates for the job of 
super-chancellor fared in the commit- 
tee selection process. The story also 
reported the vote count and break- 
down on one of the candidates. 

The Communicator uncovered 
the story on Monday afternoon, but 
decided not to print the information. 

"It's unfortunate that someone 
talked out of turn," said Walter 
Helmke, acting committee chairman. 
Helmke said that the committee 
e charged with secrecy, 



Rollie Clements, a student mem- 
ber of the committee, said that it 
definitely was not one of the students 
who was the leak. 

"I can account for all the 
students from the time of the meeting 
until we all saw a faculty member 
who had the information," said 
Clements. Clements said that the 
faculty member knew the outcome as

Styles of such big-band jazz 
artists as Stan Kenton, Count Basie 
and Buddy Rich will be recalled when 
the University Jazz Band presents a

meeting. 

The Journal-Gazette reported 
that the students proved to be the 
margin for approval of one candidate. 
The story suggested that a certain 
memorandum expressing the candi- 
dates support for a bubble dome 
athletic structure on campus was a 
key in delivering the student vote. 

Although admitting having seen 
the memo, Clements strongly denied 
being influenced by it. The memo 
caused a negative reaction with him, 
Clements said. 

Helmke refused to comment oni 
what action the committee might take 
to discourage such leaks. He said that 
Henry Rood, permanent committee 
chairman, would be back in town to 
preside al the Monday meeting. 

Clements summed up the com- 
mittee's feelings on the matter by 
saying, "I sure would like to know 
who's leaking the information." 



The two presidents 
thai there will be no unified budget for 
IU-PU next year. Originally, the 
super-chancellor agreement called 
for a business administration and 
budget to go into effect Julyl. 

The presidents blamed this 
change in plans on the decision by the 
Indiana General Assembly to delete a 
clause that dealt with IU-PU unifica- 
tion in a supplemental budget bill. 

Ryan and V 



clause would have i

d with a 






budget and would have made Purdue 
the fiscal agent for the campus. 

According to the two presidents, 
the deletion of this clause from the bill 
meant that the universities could not 
go ahead with the merger. 

State Senator Walter Helmke 
disagreed with this analysis in an 
inteview with the Communicator 
yesterday. Helmke said that he does 
not think the deletion of the clause 
has any effect on the merger. 

Helmke saia mat tne clause waa 
merely stating the wishes of the 
legislature, and as such it would have 
allowed or prohibited nothing. 

He said that even if the clause had 
been passed into law, it would not 
have authorized a single lU-Pu 
budget. 

Helmke said that he could not 
recall any legislation being requested 
by the two universities enabling them 
to unify the budget of the Fort Wayne 
Campus. The super-chancellor agree- 
ment said that such legislation would 
be requested if it were needed.

court's history or one of its great 
decisions, a turning point." 

He added, "And it's a new experi- 
ence for me to go places and be 
picketed and called Pontius Pilate,

sible for 500,000 deaths in the past

operations on this campus they could 
negotiate a purchase of services 

without the consent of the legislature. 

This is what has been done for 
certain departments, like Student 
Services and the Library, which are 
operatd under what is called SUR

Helmke also said that if the two 
presidents wanted to merge the 



Helmke assumed that the new 
super-chancellor would be respon- 
sible for studying that type of 
proposal. 

Both presidents denied that the 
legislative action of deleting the 
clause meant that the IU-PU unifica- 
tion should halt completely. "I don't 
view that as a sign to I.U. that we 
should retreat,"said Ryan. 

"We should proceed in an orderly 
manner to comeup with proposals on 
a structure for a singlechancellor and 
joint business operation." 



SSAC hosts merger forum 
to get student opinions 



The Student Steering Advisory 
Committee sponsored an open 
hearing on the first floor of the 
Student Union March 6 concerning 
the impact of the merger of 
Indiana-Purdue on its students. 

A steady stream of students 
stopped by the table manned by Terri 
Forte, Paul Green, Roland Clemens, 
Charles Pratt, and Greg Lewark. 

The SSAC is organizing eight 
task forces to make proposals to 
presidents John Ryan of Indiana and 
Arthur Hansen of Purdue about the 
upcoming merger. 

A tablet was provided to record 
suggestions and questions asked by 
the students. 

Most remarks regarded areas where 
students felt immediate changes 
were needed on this campus, such as 
cafeteria prices and the conditions of 
the parking lots. 

Some remarks were geared 
towards more specific issues re- 
garding the merger. Some students 
stated that they were not in favor of 
an independent campus because they 
would rather have their diplomas 
read Indiana or Purdue than 
Indiana-Purdue University. 

On the other hand, many 
remarks were made in favor of 



complete independence for IU-PU. 

Pratt commented, "It would be 
important for us to have more of 
these meetings with the students to 
get a broader spectrum of student 
opinion.

i the ballroom of the Student 

Patterson Fletcher, Inc. and the

present the show, featuring spring

There will be a $2.00 donation 
requested to raise money in order for 
the class to take a trip to Indianapolis 
to visit the Ely Lilly Company and the 
Indiana University Dental School. 
there will be door prizes awarded at 
the show and refreshments will be 
served.

FOOTNOTES: A CONGRESSIONAL REPORT 



Urges challenges to railway cuts 



More unkept promises 

Last Monday I.U, President John Ryan and Purdue President Arthur 
Hansen were on campus to discuss the unification of IU-PU. The next 
time they come, they will be about as welcome as the four horsemen, and 
that does not refer to an old Notre Dame backfield. 

The presidents disappointed a lot of people on this campus. Anger 
may better describe the reaction of many to what the presidents had to 
say. 

The two presidents made it perfectly clear that they did not want to 
hear any more of this nonsense about unifying I.U. and Purdue into one 
university in Fort Wayne. 

What they were saying was this: ignore what we said last fall when 
we announced that a super-chancellor would be appointed to unify this 
campus. We really have no such intention. 

The presidents confirmed the worst suspicions of many at IU-PU. 
The presidents merely hope to present a public front of unity while con- 
tinuing the divisiveness. 

The presidents apparently hoped to fool the faculty and students for a 
short time and the Fort Wayne community for a much longer time. 
They hoped to fool everyone into thinking that IU-PU's problems would 
be solved. 

But the presidents have made it clear that these problems will 
remain indefinitely. They have also given the green light to the 
pro-independence people to renew their campaign for separation. 

A short time ago, while enthusiasm was the prevailing mood and 
unification seemed only a short way down the road, the Purdue faculty 
voted on the question of independence. It was a very close vote, even 
though people were optimistic about the future. 

Those fifty professors who voted for independence have proved to be 
the best judges of the integrity of Messrs. Ryan and Hansen. 

Search and screen leaks 

Yesterday the Journal-Gazette reported the status of the applications 
of two candidates for the position of super-chancellor. The story reported 
what the Communicator believes to be highly confidential information on 
how the Chancellor Search and Screen Committee acted on the 
applications of two individuals. 

The Communicator learned of that same information late Monday 
afternoon. We chose not to print it even though it would have been one hell 
of a scoop. 

We believe that how the committee acts on certain candidates should 
be held in the strictest of confidence. The committee is dealing with the 
careers of professional educators and manager 

The publishing of such highly sensitive material does not speak well 
of this university. It is not fair to the candidates under consideration. 

The Communicator has taken great pride in reporting certain items 
that are not supposed to be made public. But this is a different situation in 
that printing of information about committee votes endangers the 
credibility of the committee. 

We will not print any information on specific candidates until the 
committee reaches its final list. And we hope the committee can find and 
plug its leak. 



IN BLACK AND WHITE 



On February 1, 1974 the Depart- 
ment of Transportation submitted a 
■eporl to Congress concerning i 



Certain details of that report 
indeed shocking in that the Depart- 
ment proposed the curtailment of rail 
service in such a manner that the 
economic life of northeastern Indiana 
would be severely affected. Small 
communities as well as Fort Wayne 
would have severe hardships worked 

Let us keep in mind that this is 
only a plan but indeed a plan which 
could be more than a feeler to 
determine the reaction from the 
communities affected. It could be 
implemented unless we move strenu- 
ously to block it. A public hearing will 
be held in Indianapolis on March 11 at 
which time we have an opportunity to 
challenge the validity of the plan. And 
it will be challenged. We are doing 
this by challenging the underlying 
assumptions of the report. For 
example, the report considers only 
freight service and does not take into 
account the effect that the abandon- 
ment of certain rail lines would have 
on the National Rail Passenger 
Corporation (Amtrak). 

The Penn Central east-west line 
through Fort Wayne is proposed for 
abandonment. This would force the 
termination of the single passenger 
train in Fort Wayne, the New York to 
Chicago Broadway Limited. To me it 
is inconceiveable that in a time of 
reduced fuel supplies and projected 
greater dependence on mass trans- 
portation, one of the nation's top 100 
Metropolitan areas would be left with 
no rail passenger service. 

A second challenge which should 
be made to the proposals is by way of 
attacking the data that has been used 
by the Secretary of Transportation's 
Task Force. Old statistics have been

Different from dream 



By RICHARD SOKOLOWSK1 



The first t 


me I saw a black 


of Jewish ghettos in Poland, but the 


American. I v 


as a teenager in 


Jews were better off in poor, viciously 


Cracow, Poland 


I looked at him in 




admiration; his 


kinwasasbeautiful- 


In the factories they got the 



suit. His strong, big body must have 
been in unknown lands; he crossed 
oceans, he paced streets of a distant 
planet America and he lived above 
clouds in a skyscraper. In Polish 
reality he was married to a 
middle-aged Slavic woman, had two 
children and played trumpet in a 
night club. My parents and their 
friends used to go there more often 
than to other places for music and just 
to see "the American." At one time 
they entered into a conversation with 
him, but neither side understood the 
language of the other very well. One 
things they got and 



lowest jobs, which reminded 
Polish workers forcibly employed in 

On the streets they were segre- 
gated from the rest, tense, fearful, 
hostile, which reminded me of the 
Jews in Warsaw briefly before the 
Ghetto insurrection against the Ger- 



I walk the streets of this rich and 
breathtaking land, white man, happy 
and satisfied and meet the vigilant, 
tense, guarded stares of the blacks. 
They watch me cautiously the same 
way I was watching, as a kid, heavy 
armed German soldiers trampling 
my land, or as the Jews must have 
watched their persecutors. In my 
uniform of white skin I look just like 
another predator. 

But they do not know that I know 



that the 
America was "no 
good." 

It has bothered me ever since. 
The USA always appeared to me a 
promised land of racing cowboys, 
never-ending highways, shining cars, 
waterfalls and good life. Like every 
Polish family we had a legend about 
some distant relative who lived there 
and was fabulously happy. 

I met my next American in 
Warsaw, Poland in 1954. I was a 
student then and did moonlighting as 
an amateur interpreter to the youth 
who were attending an International 
Congress. I was prosocialistic then, 
but did not believe all official 
propaganda against the USA. Some- 
what it did not sound true. For most 
Poles it was a dream to live in 
America, and I could not accept the 
sacrilege. My new friend had big 
success with Polish girls and in free 
time attacked America which I was 
defending. He stayed away from 
white youth of the American delega- 
tion and insisted that the USA v 




used. What is needed is to get some 
measure of the actual number of 
freight car loads coming and going 
out of the Fourth District each year so 
that the relatively low figures 
contained in the report can be 
questioned with authority. (As an 



example, the report stated that the 
Crawfordsville area has significantly 
higher freight car usage than the Fort 
Wayne Area. This may be true but it 
doesn't seem likely on the face of it.) 
As a result of this assault on the 
economy of northeastern Indlana- 




and that is what it is-I am asking 
public officials, business and industry 
to report on their use of rail lines 
which are projected to be abandoned 
in the Fourth District. This data will 
be correlated and will form the basis 
for strong testimony to be given in 
Indianapolis on March 11. 

Another aspect of mis proposed 



still depends on the rail service for the 
shipment of grain and other farm 
commodities. To abandon these "life 
lines" would not only adversely affect 
the economy of the rural community 
but would surely make the problem of 
getting food to the consuming public 
more expensive. 

It is my hope that every 
community, every chamber of Com- 
merce, every affected industry, every 
affected organization and every 
constituent would join in challenging 
the proposal which would cause the 
abandonment of vital rail lines and 
help enlighten and bring some 
common sense to those who are 
making such an outrageous proposal.

1. A single chancellor reporting to the 
two Presidents will be appointed by 
the Presidents, with approval of the 
two Boards. 

2. Purdue will become the fiscal 
agent for all appropriations, fees, and 
earnings at Fort Wayne. The budget 
for the expenditures of these funds 
will be approved by the Boards of 
Trustees upon recommendation of the 
two Presidents. A unified budget for 
the campus will be developed by the

chancellor inhis functions as business 
manager and to the Treasurer of 
Purdue University with regard to his 
treasurer's functions. 

4. The countless details of the fiscal 
and management operation will be 
worked out by the fiscal Vice 
Presidents and their staffs, in 
conjunction with university counsel 
and approved by the Presidents and 

- the Boards of Trustees. If legislation 
is required in the process, it will be 
presented to the 1974 General 
Assembly. 

5. The two Presidents will set in 
motion a search for the chancellor as

asked to develop recommendations 
for the internal govenance mechan- 
ism such as a merged senate, the 
participating arrangements, for iden-

To the Editor: 

As a member of the American 
Federation of Teachers (AFT) at 
Indiana-Purdue, I wish to take issue 
with the editorial entitled "Search 
and screen," (Communicator of 
February 25). As I see it, this article 
displays not only faulty reasoning, it 
also misrepresents the position of 
AFT with regard to the selection of 
the super-chancellor. The editorial's 
argument that AFT is undermining 
the function of the Search and Screen 
Committee rests on three erroneous 
premises: first that AFT is trying to 
twist the committee's arm to obtain ■ 
the list of names under final 
consideration, second that AFT seeks 
to veto the recommendation of the 
committee through a faculty referen- 
dum, third that the real intent of AFT 
is to deprive the Chancellor Search 
and Screen Committee of "what little 
power it has been given." 

In order to correct the editorial's 
distorted image of AFT, I would like 
to reiterate the union's position 
regarding the selection of the new 
super-chancellor as reported earlier 
by Tommy Franke, (Communicator 
of January 14). AFT does not believe 
that the committee's list of names 
should be publicized. Nor is AFT 
vying with the committee for power, 
as the editorial seems to imply. AFT 
at Indiana-Purdue is concerned lest 
the Chancellor Search and Screen 
Committee become a tool used by the 
administration to create the illusion 
of representative democracy, while

questions as academic freedom, 
student and faculty participation in 
curricular development, the role of 
women's studies on this campus, 
tenure, loads and salary increments 
as well as providing an educational 
atmosphere receptive to innovation. 

The editorial's glib manner of 
equating administrative paternalism 
with a legitimate concern for faculty 
and librarian participation in the 
selection of the new chancellor 
reveals the insensitivity and una- 



i which perpetuate apathy 
and which will stifle the educational 
growth of this campus. 

MARTHE ROSENFELD 

Editor's note: The following Is the 
text of the resolution passed by AFT 
and sent to all members of the 
Chancellor Search and Screen Com- 
mittee. 

Whereas the Search and Screen 
Committee is now in its final phase of 
deliberations on potential candidates 
for the Chancellor of Indiana-Purdue 
University at Ft. Wayne, the mem- 
bers of Indiana-Purdue University, 
Ft. Wayne, American Federation of 
Teachers Local 3178 remind the 
Search and Screen Committee of the 
position of the American Federation 
of Teachers on the selection of the 
new chancellor. 

Be it therefore resolved that the 
candidates for administrative head of 
Indiana-Purdue University at Ft. 
Wayne interviewed by the Search and 
Screen Committee be brought to this 
campus for a meeting and for 
discussions with the faculty. 

Further, that following this meet- 
ing and the discussions the candi- 
dates' names be submitted to the 
faculty by mail ballot to allow 
expressions of approval or disappro- 
val to the Search and Screen 
Committee before its final choices are 

Further, that the final choices of 
the Search and Screen Committee be

and the results of the balloting be

Doctor Robert Novak of the IU-PU English Department

Hal Gresham, 



his escutcheon but no rocker added to his sleeve either. One 
of the men of his unit went A.W.O.L. He returned, was 
reprimanded, and two weeks later received a promotion! 
Hal mused to a close buddy that something was wrong. It 
almost looked like you had to make a name for yourself, in 
any manner, to get a promotion. About a month later, Hal 
was involved in an aircraft accident. He wasn't hurt. But his 
name did appear on the report. Apparently true to Hal's 
shrewd surmises, he got noticed. Within a fortnight he was 
promoted to Staff Sergeant.

SURPRISE! 

Four members of S.350 knew Hector Navedo was due to 
celebrate his birthday, so they baked him a cake. 
Everything was well planned. Directly after class, the 
group, including Dr. Virginia Craig, gathered down near 
the coffee machines in Kettler Hall that February Friday. 
Having produced the cake and conveyed it, the committee 
had collapsed. No one brought plates, or forks, or napkins or 
anything-but cake and congratulations. With ingenuity 
worthy ol Swiss Family Robinson someone procured Kraft 
towels from a nearby convenience, and that served to hold 
the cake, and clean the finger 'forks.' 

Of course, the cake had to be cut before the eating, and 
that proved the pluperfect problem. Finally, Beth McKinley 
produced a pair of scissors from her bag, and improvised a 
slicing technique. It was fun and represented the best in 
fellowship and survival. Mary Makris was talking over the 
bash later with Beth. It was then that the ingenious cake 
carver admitted to having the scissors available in her bag 
as she had, "Used them to trim the dog's hair." Mary is still 
a trifle pale, and also wondering how you say "heave" in 
Spanish.

COACH WEHRMEISTER RESIGNS AS HEAD BASKET- 
BALL COACH 

The Indian a-Purd up basketball team ended their 
season last Saturday with a disappointing 101-99 loss to 
Purdue North Central. It was the 23rd loss of the season for 
the team, which was hampered with injuries and a very 
difficult schedule throughout the s 




Wehrmeister blamed the lack of interest by the students 
and faculty of the University and the annual exchange of 
players on the team as key factors leading to the anemic 



within the limits of an unrealistic schedule set up by the 
inept Athletic Department at Indiana-Purdue. The 
the Mastodons had the dubious honor of playing Southern 
niinois-Edwardsvllle twice. This team has Purdue 
University on their schedule. Need more be said? The 
Mastodons also had to play Marian, Anderson, Huntington, 
and Taylor. Two of these teams paid Indiana-Purdue to 
play them in their openers. 

Even though Coach Wehrmeister had many noteworthy 
excuses, he must take some of the blame for the poor 
showings by the Mastodon squads. Last year the team was 
loaded with talent, including two ail-city players in high 
school, but they could only manage 11 victories, 3 against 
lowly Concordia. Wehrmeister noticeably tried his hardest 
to produce a successful team, but he just didn't seem to 
possess the skills to organize a winning team. 

Several of the players who had played for him his first 
two years were discouraged from playing this year because 
of his qualities as a coach. However, as a captain of this 
years team, and a player for all three years under Coach 
Wehrmeister, I want to wish him the best of luck, and 
express my sorrow that things didn't work out right for him 
at Indiana -Purdue. He is a great individual, and even 
though I questioned some of his coaching techniques, I think 
he should be recognized for his great desire, and credited 
with at least attempting to build Indiana-Purdue's image in 
athletics. 

I'm sure I can speak for most of my team members by 
saying that we appreciated the fine efforts of Coaches 
Wehrmeister and Hoyle. They tried their best, but they just 
couldn't get the job done. 



and Coach Wehrmeister informed them that 
they would all win awards for their year of dedication and 
desire to play for the basketball team. 

Rex Putt was one of three captains on the team, and he 
led the team in scoring and rebounding for the 73-74 season. 
He tallied a seasonal high of 32 against Spring Arbor at the 
Central Gymnasium, and scored 28, 27, and 24 twice, in 
other good scoring games during the season. He pulled 
asonal high 20 rebounds in their final game of the 

His brother, freshman Dean Putt, scored an even 400 
points in an impressive first year of college competition. He 
t seasonal high 26 in a game against Iu-Pu 
Indianapolis in a hoe game, and notched 25 in a game 
against Purdue North Central at Michigan City. He played 
in all 28 games, and held the best free throw shooting 
percentage for the Mastodons, as he hit over 80 percent of 
of his charity tosses. 

Gary Gray just missed averaging ten points a game for 
the Tuskers. He scored his seasonal high against IU 
Southeast as he popped in 22 points in the game at 
Jeffersonville. The North Side graduate of a few years 
back, poured in 19 points in a Mastodon win over IU South 
Bend and hit for 17 in one of the earlier games in the season. 
Gary was handicapped with a knee injury he suffered at 
mid-season, and he was just getting back into shape near 
the end of the season. 

Gary Trump, back for his third year of action as a 
starting guard, had a difficult season, but still managed to 
hit for 228 points. Gary was another of the three Mastodon 
captains. He was bothered by a foot injury throughout the 
but began coming on strong at the end of the year. 
His seasonal high was 21 points. 

Dave Peterson, an East Noble graduate, tossed in 248 
points for the Mastodons this year. He hit hisip^ak at 
mid-season when he tallied a seasonal high of 25 against St. 
Francis. He also scored 21 points in a win over Purdue 
North Central at the Central Gymnasium. 

Al Curry, although ineligible for first semester action, 
stayed around and played for the reserve squad until the 
second semester. He joined the varsity after averaging 
about thirty points a game for the reserves. As a varsity 
player he tallied 102 points in only 11 contests, and was an 
important asset to the Mastodon running game. 

Keith Mendenhall, the blond Woodlan Warrior 
graduate, played as the Mastodon sixth man throughout the 
season. He scored 194 points, most of them in coming off the 
bench, and had several outstanding games. He totaled a 
college career high of 25 against South Bend, and also 
poured in 20 points against Spring Arbor. 

Dan Grussing was the third captain on the 73-74 
Mastodon team. Dan scored 204 points and was one of the 
key rebounders for the team. He scored a seasonal high of 
20 points in the win over South Bend. He reached double 
figures on many other occasions. 

Kevin Maher was an unfortunate victim of a broken jaw 
during the season, so he saw limited action. However, when 
he was available he played mostly in a reserve role. He 
scored 20 points for the season, and was a productive 
rebounder when he got the opportunity to play. 

Tracey White also saw limited action, but he showed 
dedication for the sport as he stayed in the entire season. 
He scored 21 points, as he often came off the bench in the 
late stages of the game. 

Kent Rosenbury was one reserve who often got the job 
done. Hewantedtodoit. He played infrequently, but when 
he did get the chance, he found time to score 26 seasonal 
points. He often played as a starter last year. 

Bob Shriner saw action in onty three games, but was 
able to score four points in his second year at 
Indiana-Purdue. 

John Perkins, a familiar face around the Indiana- 
Purdue Campus, joined the team in the second semester. 
He was a real inspirational leader for the team, and was 
able to score his first two college points, despire only 
playing in portions of two games 



not only equalled John's feat of one bucket, but he 
very worthwhile to the team as an experienced 

Well, that about wraps up this season of basketball. It 
wasn't the best season a team could ask for, but there were 
many joys as well as disappointments, and OF COURSE 
there were five noteworthy VICTORIES.
