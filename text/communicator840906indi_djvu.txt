Students see 
improved parking 



By DOUG RUN VAN 

SurrWrLlir 

Parking Dl IPFW Is usually a 
problem [or students hI Uie beginning 
of each semester This semester, 
boweier, seems to be an except! on. 

The Imp rove menl In avallabUtly of 
parking spaces may stem from the 
addlUon o[ the new iSO space lot 
located near Ihc Mullipurpwe 
Bulldtng. 

Yvonne Berry, a senior studying 
political science, said she parks In the

Imporlanl consideration In finding a 
good parking space. 

"I come In either early In the 
morning or late Id Ihe afternoon and 1 
don't have ony problems," Schannen 
said. 



though it may seem inconvenient at 
ihe present time. 

"We're only here a few years — not 
as long as the University or the 
faculty." he said. "Solutions should 
consider the fuhire, IPFW shouldn't be 
covered with flsphalL" 

Hess also offered some good advice 
on how to retain a positive frame of 
mind when searching for a parking 
space, "I don't make parking the thing 
mat makes or tircaka my day."

A student parks in an "A" lot after 5

Yvonne Berry didn't think the new 
parking lot was necessarily a good 
solution to IPFW's parking dilemma. 
Berry said the temporary lot located 
between Kettler Hall and the SL 
Joseph River "should have been 
paved" and made permonedt. "There 
were a lot of tickets written for cars 
parking illegally In order to l&gt;e closer 
to Kettler Hall. It would be better tn 
have more parking close to Kettler," 
she said 

Not all would oeree with making the 
temporary parking lot permanent 
Senior Patrick Hess, who has attended 
IPFW for the last four years, says that 
this year "parking ts a lot easier to 
Hnd. Don't pave the temporary lot — 
plant trees Instead." He feels that the

campus was correctly placed ex-en

If a shjdent, faculty or staff receives

"The fact that a student did not read

Out-of-state students face unique problems

Staff Writer 

In addition (o fighting the long lines 
during (he registration week al IPFW, 
an out-of-state student faces countless 
other problems of which most students 
don'l consider. 

This semester aU undergraduole 
non-resident students pay a tuition fee 
of 198.60 per credit hour, in contrast 
with an undergraduate residen( fee of 
139 .65 far Indiana residents. AU

there are other problems that are
