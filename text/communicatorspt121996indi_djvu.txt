IPSGA plans community celebration 



by Lisa Zlnn 
SUIT Reporter 

Music, dancing, entertainment and 
informative activities at virtually 
no cosl Impossible? 

Indiana Purdue Students Government 
Association (IPSGA) does not think so. 

On Friday, Sept 27. they will be sponsor- 
ing "A Celebration of Campus and 
Community" for an evening of family. 
friends and fun. The evening will be from 
5:30-11 p.m. and is open to the public as 
well as fPFW students, faculty and staff 

According lo Gina Burgess, student sen- 
ate pro (cm, the main focus of this celebra- 
tion is to involve evening students with the 
campus. Evening students are often not 
involved with campus activities, said 
Burgess, and that takes away from their col- 
lege experience 

"Since many of the evening students have 
families, it is often difficult to find an activ- 
ity thai is fun for everyone, convenient and 



not too expensive," said Burgess. 

Approximately 35 community groups are 
involved in the celebration and there will be 
activities for all ages. 

Free tours of a fire engine and ambulance 
will be available for tbe children as well as 
fingerprinting by the Fort Wayne Police 
Department. The FWPD will keep records 
of the fingerprints in case of future need. 

IPSGA welcomes Happy the Hobo from 
FOX to the festivities, with other mascots 
from around the city to be scheduled. 

There will be face painting in Walb 
Memorial Union. Also, Science Central will 
have hands-on activities throughout the 
night on the second floor of Walb. 

At 7 p m , on the main floor of Walb, the 
Fort Wayne Ballet will give its premier per- 
formance of the year. Kennel Oberly, artistic 
director for the company, has prepared 
"Goldberg Bach Variations" for the evening. 
The Grand Rental Station is donating the 
performance floor. 

Musical group Heart Stone and The 



"... it is often difficult to find 

an activity that is 

tun tor everyone, convenient 

and not too expensive" 

- Gina Burgess, 
student senate pro tern 

Settlers will be performing together from 
6:30-7 p.m. on the 2nd floor of Walb. They 
are often seen at the Johnny Appleseed 
Festival. There will be an opportunity to see 
pioneers and colonists around the Union as 
well. 

The Fort Wayne Children's Choir, which 
recently relumed from its European tour, is 
scheduled to sing from 6-6:30 p.m. on the 
ground floor of Walb. 

Walb G21 will be reserved from 8-9:30 
p.m for a coffeehouse/poetry reading. "The 
Power of Our Voices" will allow those inter- 
ested to enjoy a sip of coffee with the enter- 
tainment of poetry. 



Several politicians will also be appearing 
for the event. Rep. Mark Souder will be fly- 
ing in from Washington DC. to attend the 
evening with a few of his fellow 
Republicans. They will be located in Walb 
226. Jerry Houseman, Democratic candi- 
date for Souder's seat, will be in Walb 224, 
joined by other Democratic candidates. 
According to Burgess, IPSGA is hoping this 
will encourage eligible students to register 
to vote. 

In support of "Rock the vote," a national 
campaign to register young, would-be vot- 
ers, members of IPSGA and Sean Smyth 
from 96.3 The Edge, have worked together 
lo sponsor a showcase of local bands which 
will be held at the Walb Patio from 7-11 
p.m Approximately five to six bands will be 
performing. However, Burgess could not 
specify which bands have been asked to per- 
form. 

"We will not know who is appearing until 
two weeks before Ihe evenl." explains 



Burgess. Several 96.3 FM disc jockeys will 
be available for the public lo meet through- 
out the evening. 

Many student organizations are going to 
have booths set up in Walb lo inform cele- 
bration participants about their groups 

"All students in the booths will be pass- 
ing out things, whether they are for informa- 
tion or a gift," Burgess says. IPSGA has 
Five more openings for student organization 
booths Interested students may contact 
Gina Burgess by going to the IPSGA office, 
Walb 225, or calling 481-6586. 

Parking for the event will be free and 
open to everyone. Dinner will be served in 
the cafeteria from 4:30-6:30 p.m. A main 
dish will be available along with two side 
dishes, a beverage and dessert 

According to Burgess, students, faculty. 
staff and Ihe surrounding community arc 
encouraged to join in the festivities for an 
evening of celebration to kick off the new 
school year.

by Jeremy Ecenbarger 
News Editor 

ll is Ihe type of script that gave Tom 
Hanks his first Academy award. Yet, it has 
a futuristic touch. Many may say thai the 
theme of the production is controversial. 
However, it is a story that could affect gen- 
erations. The topic is AIDS The production 
is "Beirut."

named Torch has been quarantined after test- 
ing positive for a nameless disease. His girl- 
friend, who has not been infected, makes ihe 
dangerous jo umey across ihe quarantine line 
lo be with him. The production makes a 
powerful statement about sexually transmit- 
ted disease and deals with ihe human spirit

Life, theater director, "but it's meiaphored 
for AIDS."

Jack Ryan: A closer look at events, responses 



by Nol Beckley 
Managing Editor 

Conflict ... 

March 2. 1996. a panel convened to hear 
the grievance of former instructor Jack Ryan, 
Ryan was dismissed from the university after 
a student, Joyce Gaines, filed an informal 
complaint with IPFW 

Gaines claimed Ryan made racist com- 
mcnls to her in from of the class Ryan was 
teaching Ryan said he was emphasizing lo 
Gaines and the rest of the class lo identify 
yourself well because people may forgei what 
you say and associate what you say with how 
you look 

Ryan admitted lo calling Gaines a "big, 
black woman" during class. He later apolo- 
gized to bcr during class and in a meeting with 
Mary Scudder. chair of ihe human services 
department 

At ihe end of that meeting, Scudder said 
Gaines considered ihe matter closed and 
"behind us now." Gaines even bugged Ryan. 

Two weeks later, Gaines went lo Donna 
Middleton. affirmative aciion/equal opportu- 



News analysis 



niiy officer and said Ryan was avoiding her 
and treating her differently than before their 
meeting with Scudder. 

Ryan's atlomey speculated in his opening 
siatemeni lo ihe grievance committee thai 
Gaines may have spoken with an atlorney who 
realized there was money to be made in a suit 

IPFW and Purdue (IPFW's fiscal agent) 
seillcd with Gaines for S9.500. 
The story breaks ... 

John Bnggs. former writing instmcior, 
attended (he hearing and wrote a column 
which appeared in The Journal Gazelle 

"IPFW administrators have overreached. 
By publicly labeling Ryan a racist, they have 
made it virtually impossible for him to find 
another leaching position." Bnggs wrote 

The local media leapt on ihe story. Paul 
Philips, a local radio personality, devoted sev- 
eral shows to Ryan and his case. Ryan even 
appeared on ihe show one evening. 

Philips said be became interested in the 
case because il seemed ihe university suffered 
from "institutional arrogance." 



Resolution ....' 

Two weeks ago we reported Ryan decided 
not to return to IPFW after a long absence 
which started at ihe end of the Spring 1995 



Ryan had fought to be reinstated for over a 
year and thinks he was on the verge of being 
offered a position Ryan said he suffers from 
emphysema now and could nol leach effec- 
tively in this condition. 

Before Ryan made his decision, the griev- 
ance committee judged that the university 
failed lo handle Gaines' complain l properly, 
according to IPFW's "inierim procedures for 
formal and informal complaints." 

Ryan is slill considering further legal 
action. 
Observations ... 

During the eighteen monlhs. starling when 
Gaines filed her complaint and ending when 
Ryan decided nol lo reium lo IPFW. Ryan was 
essentially Libeled a racist by ihe university's 
Licit approval ol Gaines' charge and Ryan was 
essentially fired. 

Although Purdue President Steven Beering 
denied Ryan's grievance he did reaffirm 



"IPFW's right to decide whom it wants to 
appoint as associate faculty members." 

Before Beering's decision, everyone 
involved wilh the case said the decision was 
up to Purdue 

Ironically, ihe decision not lo rehire Ryan 
came from Fred Kirchhoff, former vice chan- 
cellor of academic affairs. 

Kirchhoff said in a letter lo Gaines on April 
15, 1995. "As promised. 1 have taken steps lo 
ensure ibat Mr Ryan will nol be invited lo 
teach at IPFW after this semester." 

Chancellor Michael Wartell wrote in a letter 
to Ryan lhai he concurred wilh Kirchhoff's 
decision. 

Nine days after Kirchhoff's letter. Mary 
Scudder wrote to James Jones, dean of health 
sciences, about her disagreement with 
Kirchhoff's decision. 

"I am concerned that ihe decision seems lo 
have been made before Mr. Ryan had a chance 
to tell his side of the siory," Scudder said 
Scudder also said that since Ryan has not 
heard the specifics of the case "the facls may 
have golten distorted."

Hitler wakes up from his grave pleased by 
Hate should not reC ent student actions... 
be part of college 



Over Labor Day weekend, a 
banner advertising a stu- 
dent group was ripped 
down and shredded just because of 
the content. 

The banner which was ripped 
down advertised a group which 
specifically welcomes all sexual 
orientations Tbeir fliers and ban- 
ners welcome "gays, lesbians, bi- 
sexuais and aJlies" witbin (heir 
fold. 

The sheer haired for the group 
and for homosexuals signified by 
the destruction of the banner shows 
how little we have evolved as a cul- 
ture. 

Many people are comfortable 
enough with tbeir own sexuality to 
allow other people who bave a dif- 
ferent lifestyle to live their lives 
according to their own conscience 

Other people are so insecure 
about their sexuality that they must 



make every effort to insulate them- 
selves from any other alternatives 
Are the people who fight homosex- 
uality scared of their own latent 
tendencies? Many educated people 
believe hatred toward homosexual- 
ity is a feeble attempt to deny their 
own sexuality. 

Maybe this is not the case, but 
who are any of us to judge how oth- 
ers live? We go through this life 
learning about other people and 
about ourselves. Much of this 
learning happens to people while 
they're in college. 

As human beings we should 
make an effort to kill this warped 
thinking. If you hate another group, 
for whatever reason, look within 
yourself and try to find out who you 
are. 

Maybe you will find you owe 
someone an apology for what you 
did in the past

Senior slams blading ban; 
fights for right to skate 



To the editor: 

I'm a senior and 1 feel that what 
1 have to say is very important 
when it concerns the students' wel- 
fare at this institution. We, the stu- 
dents, have put up with a lot of crud 
when it concerns our so-called 
rights. 

Whether it be a tuition hike, the 
student service fee increase (I 
would like to know what (his fee is 
all about) or any bills that are 
brought forth by the administration 
concerning the students' interests. 

I know I don't want any admin- 
istrator telling me what I should or 
shouldn't do when it comes to me 
being a student. As a student, 1 feel 
that I should have a say when it 
comes to certain bans. I should 
have a right to know beforehand 
about any bans that are being 
implemented. 

One ban that I have a strong feel- 
ing for is tbe rollerblading ban. 
What I would like to know is what 
person(s) thought up this ban. The 
next thing I would like to know is 
why. 

Yes ... 1 am a rollerblader or 
"blade rs," as we would like to be 
known, and 1 do like to rollerblade 
on this campus. I bave been blading 
for about five years and 1 feel blad- 
ing is one of the best means of out- 
door exercise. On top of that, I feel 
it is great means of transportation 
without (he use of a car. 

From time to time, 1 like to blade 
from my house to IPFW and back (I 
live very close to the university). 
This is great exercise for me. The 
roads in this town are utterly horri- 
ble when it comes to rollerblading 
and so are the sidewalks. IPFW is 
one of the best places for me to per- 
form this exercise. 

But now look what's happen- 
ing — the institution is taking it 
away from me. Hell, from us! Yes 1 
know, the safety of the staff and 
students is important and I feel any 
blader who jeopardizes their safety 
should be excused from further use 
of their legs. 

But to those who blade with care 
shouldn't have to pay. I've been 
blading at IPFW for a very long 



A censor is a man who knows more 

than he thinks you ought to." 

- Laurence Peter 

professor of education 

1977 



time now and I have never seen any 
blader harm or injure a student or 
staff member. I generally don't like 
to blade when there are a lot of peo- 
ple around. 

But I'm very angry at what's 
happening. This ban was brought 
forth before the semester even 
started, before the majority of PAY- 
ING students were even here. 

Now, I put a lot of money into 
this institution, after all, I've been 
going to college for about six years 
and I feel I should have a right to 
blade here. We the students are 
paying for a great portion this insti- 
tution and WE are what make it up. 
There is a message that can be 
found at the Financial Aid office 
that states something so true on 
behalf of my argument. "The most 
important people at this leamirjg 
institution are the students. Without 
them, this institution wouldn' i have 
a purpose." 

If a person wants to rollerblade 
from one building to another so 
they could make it to class on time, 
then he or she should be able to do 
just that. If a student likes to blade 
on their university's pathway so 
they could get some exercise, then 
he or she should be able to do that, 
too. Don't we have that right? Do 
we not pay to go here? Maybe 
that's what (he "student fee" should 
be used for. And if anyone has a 
problem with (hat, men they should 
get over it right now. 

Give me a break. I'm not going 
to hurt anyone. Rollerblading does 
not hurt anything. No more than 
driving a car, riding a bike or walk- 
ing to class. Each of these activities 
can cause barm if done improperly. 
Since I am a paying student, I 
would really like to continue 
rollerblading at IPFW. I'd also like 
to see a lot of students protest this 
ban. Protest it until it gets abol- 
ished. You have a voice, use it. 
Don't let the institution control 
you. You are the one with the con- 
trol. 



GOP distorts abortion; 
criminalizes miscarriage 



To the editor 

I know several women who have 
had miscarriages who knew that 
they miscarried at the time. I also 
know that most women sometimes 
experience late periods in their 
menstrual cycles, followed by heav- 
ier than normal discharges. Often 
such discharges are actually miscar- 
riages of zygotes (really early-stage 
fetuses) that were simply rejected 
by the women's bodies. 

Under the legal definition of 
abortion called for by the 
Republican Party platform, human 
embryos would receive equal pro- 
tection under the law which the 14th 
Amendment currently grants those 
who can read these words. It is very 
clear that if Republicans succeed, 
women found guilty of committing 
abortions will face lengthy prison 
sentences or even the death penalty. 
depending upon the states in which 
tbe abortion occurs. 

Less clear is how my friends who 
lose wanted pregnancies, and those 
who experience heavier-than-nor- 
mal discharges, will be dealt with 
under such a bizarre law. Those who 
defend the Republican abortion 
plank should try to explain this. 

If the plank becomes law, those 
losses of varying degrees of signifi- 
cance to my friends would take on a 
whole new meaning in the eyes of 
an intrusive state, wouldn't they? 



Surely, both fetuses that are inten- 
tionally aborted and those that are 
accidentally aborted will receive 
equal protection under the law. So 
my challenge to the Republicans is 
to explain why they want my 
friends who miscarry to endure the 
additional burden of reporting their 
miscarriages to the police and possi- 
bly being investigated to determine 
the cause of "death." 

Also, please explain to me why 
(hose heavier than normal dis- 
charges are any business of the 
Republican Party. Currently, most 
women flush them away. Under (be 
Republican plan, those discharges 
will have to be cordoned off with 
yellow tape, examined by coroners 
(with microscopes) and police 
investigators will have to be taken 
off the trad of "lesser" crimes like 
theft, rape and non-embryo assault, 
to determine whether women who 
discharged recendy fertilized ova, 
did so by ingesting morning after 
pills, smoking too many cigarettes 
or by other nefarious means. 

In general the Republican plan 
would add a monumental layer of 
"Big Government" to aspects of 
women's lives that are none of the 
Republican Party's damn business. 

Please vote!

Perfection exists in minds of egotists 



To the editor: 

Back on campus at last! There 
are new students, new faculty, even 
a new lunch area in Kettler. But one 
thing has not changed . . . people's 
attitudes. 

I was sitting on a stone bench 
outside Kettler last Thursday, 
watching some students play hack- 
ey-sac when I overheard them talk- 
ing about tbe United Sexualitics 
fliers stuck up all around campus. 

Now, I can understand some peo- 
ple's feelings about putting all kinds 
of fliers up relating to different sex- 
ual preferences, but is it any differ- 
ent than fraternities or sororities 
putting up fliers for "rush." 

Is it worth cutting these people 
down or making fun of their 
lifestyle? I heard everything from, 
"fags are fecal freaks" to "all fags 
and lesbians should be put out of 
their, and our misery." And these 
people made it into college! 

These lamebrained, so called 
"normal" people can't see past their 



own faults, let alone be condemning 
others. Do we say that all overly 
obese people, physically handi- 
capped people or those with less 
than perfect features or bodies be 
put out of their misery? 

Face it, if we did. there would 
only be a handful of people left on 
this Earth. I'm not saying I'm per- 
fect, but I don't condemn homosex- 
uals. It's their life, not mine and not 
yours. 

I have a couple of homosexual 
friends and tbey don't try to hit on 
me or touch me or anything of the 
sort. Contrary to popular belief, 
homosexuals are very nice people. 
Most are nicer than heterosexuals 
and should be treated as such. 
Today's society is so screwed up 
and twisted around, that we fail to 
recognize that people bave feelings. 
Maybe instead of playing backey- 
sac, these self-involved people 
should take a minute and think 
about someone else for a change.

had never watched an entire 
Rush Limbaugb television program 
until the last episode. In the past 
when 1 would try, I would get frus- 
trated by some of the things he was 
trying to get his audience to believe. 
Even more so, 1 loathed seeing the 
audience applaud his ludicrous com- 
ments as if they were being spoken 
by someone of importance. So I 
never finished a single program of 
Limbaugh's But seeing the final

botbered me 
was his insis- 
tence on media 
bias. Over and 
over again be 
preached the 
media slanted 
towards liberal 
views. I see it as the contrary. 

First, Limbaugb has forgotten to 
tell you how many newspapers are 
actually owned by conservatives, 
including our very own flunky, 
Danforth Quayle. But that aside. 
Limbaugh has ignored one possible 
factor. Perhaps the media seems 
slanted only because his perception 
is slanted. This same man has 
repeatedly said the beating of 
Rodney King was not racially moti- 
vated (and yes. he's seen the tape) 
He has also said the recent rash of 
black churches destroyed by arson

only conclude 
Limbaugh's per-

So I'm watching this program,

The Todd Hanold Band is an

itself. My personal description of 
this energy, and the band for that 
mailer. Is captivating. Lei mc

music playing in

what band was

it sounded great. He lold me it was

piece band with Todd Harrold. lead 
vocalist and drummer, Jim Reiske. 
lead guitarist and backup vocalist: 
and Tun Beeler, bass guitarist. 

The band currently has two CDs 
ouL "Feels Like Rain" and "Crow " 
The band's latest CD, "Back From 
Dreaming," will be released in 
October. 

Their first CD, "Feels Like Rain," 
is a mellow disc with a jazz feel 

which can be 

attributed to 
Harrold 's previ- 
ous experience as 
a jazz drummer. 

"Crow," 
their second CD. 
"is as diverse as it 
can be," accord- 
ing to Harrold It 
contains music 
that everyone can 

relate to. 

I have 
had the privilege of previewing 
some of their unreleased disc, "Back 
From Dreaming," and found it to be 
electrifying. 

"It is intense, and definitely their 
best CD ever," Traci Gilland, book- 
ing manager, said. 

After previewing "Back From 
Dreaming," and seeing the band play 
live I would have to say that you can 
tell that these guys are having a great 
time. The band's best strength, other 
than their music, is their great com- 
munication and cohesivencss 

"It's almost like they have 
ESP," Traci Gilland said. With a 
combination of this cohesiveness 
and ihe group's love for music, their 
music proves to be magical, 

The Todd Hanold Band's next 
gig is at Columbia Street on 
Sept. 19 This is a great opportunity 
to see a group get together, make 
some great music, and have one hell 
of a time doing iL I'll be there. 
Will you?

StafT Writer 

At a young age our parents 
teach us the "ways of the 
world." They leach us eti- 
quette at the dinner table, to brush 
our teeth after each meal and to be 
polite to those we meet. They 
generally teach us what they've 
learned from their par- 
ents, leaving us to teach 
our children most of Ihe 
same. What w e ' v i 
learned then becomes our 
"norms." 

However, mosi of us have 
learned that our "norms" are 
not always shared by every- 
one. For instance, in many 
European countries it is custom- 
ary to kiss the side of the face 
when encountering an old friend 
Now, in America we might be 
taken back a bit if we saw someone 
we know, or were being introduced 
to someone new, and they kissed us 
(however nice it may be). 

Furthermore, some people regu- 
larly see women as being sub- 
servient, such as in some Indian 
cultures 

While some of these norms 
seem completely alien to us, il's 
important that we have an under- 
standing of them Americans, in 
general, lend to do things different- 
ly than Europeans, etc Americans 
tend to be more comfortable with 
their own culture. 

However, there are different cul- 
tures within American culture. For 
instance, what about Americans 
who are without hearing? 
Although they were bom in 
America, they share different 
"norms" from those who can bear 

Actually, the language differ- 
ences create standards that are 
"politically correct" only lo them. 
An example of this is rules of con- 
duct or etiquetes 

While those who can and cannot 




hear have been taught proper eu- 
queiie, what's proper is relative. 
What may be considered lo be rude 
to Ihe hearing society may be quite 
acceptable behavior to the deaf 
society. For instance, some of us 
have been told it's impolite to

has the lown 
thinking all the 
worst thoughts. 
Nevertheless, 
ihe local sheriff 
finds Percy a 
job as a wait- 
ress at the 
Spitfire Grill. 
There, she finds 
some women 
who would 
become her 
closest friends. 
Within the diner, she is first 
looked upon as the trespasser who 
just walked upon private property 
Yet, after her blunt way of answer- 
ing everyone's personal, nosy ques- 
tions, she begins to be accepted 
However, there are those like 
Nahum, played by Will Patton, who 



Richards. Azars, Dennys and the 
Spitfire Grill. While the rest may 
have a bigger menu, the "Spitfire" 
provides the best service on this side 
of the state 

When I told my friends what 
movie I was going to see, they said, 
'The Spit what?" 

"The Spitfire Grill" may not refuse I0 ^ any^ng goo d ui of 
claim any huge names in show busi- 
ness for lead actor/actress, but the 
movie is a heart-warming experi- 
ence. 

The story revolves around a 
young ex-convict named Percy 
Talbcn, played by Alison Elliot, 
who is released from prison and 
hopes to lose her past in the vastness 
of the countryside. When she enters 
the small New England lown called 
Gilead, her unexpected appearance 



her because she is an ex-convict. 

Nahum is the nephew of Hanna 
Ferguson, the owner of the Spitfire 
Grill, who obsessively worries about 
his aunt. Now that she has hired 
Percy, he is determined to find her 
every fault. 

The friendship and trust that 
forms in the diner is the essence of 
the film. Aging, sick Hanna, played 
by Ellen Burstyn. depends upon 
Percy to not only take care of her, 



but also the diner. The untold mys- 
tery of each woman draws the other 
closer, and through their mist they 
learn to confide in one another. 

The movie centers around the 
stove of the Spitfire Grill, where 
Percy, Hannah and initially quiet 
Shelby, played by Marcia Gay 
Harden, come up with a new way to 
sell the diner. When it proves to 
work, they realize thai amongst 
themselves they can overcome any- 
thing. 

If a director rolled "Thelma and 
Louise" and "Fried Green 
Tomatoes" into one, this movie is 
what they would come up with. 

Elliot gave a temiic performance 
as a little girl trying to find salvation 
from her past. Her southern accent 
adds to ber "out-of-place" character, 
while her soothing tone makes 
numerous members of the lown 
really want to share their feelings. 
Her overall appearance makes 
everyone like her even more. 

The other women also had 
refined characters which they 
played well. Burstyn gave a good 
performance as the old, crabby 
owner of the Spitfire, although I 
could hardly believe she was thai 
old in real lite. Harden was funny as 
the silent Hanna. Her character 
made a major breakthrough in the 



film. She went from a person who 
never spoke or depended on herself, 
to a confident woman of ideas and 
words worth hearing. The two sup- 
porting actresses did well together. 
Wiih their conflicting attitudes, they 
brought forth a lot of laughter. 

As the movie advertisements 
state, 'To a town with no future, 
came a girl with a past." Her hopes 
and ideas — together with her past 
— change this small town forever.

... fix it yourself 



by Cassie Riiu-r 
Features Editor 



I 



feci it already. Stress thai is 
lis only the third week into 
school and I'm already try- 
ing to figure out how I can reorga- 
nize my time, or where 1 can shave 
an hour or two off my schedule. 

This leads me to believe that 

some of you are feeling the stress of 

school as well And it's not jusi 

school, it's work and 

family life 

as well 




full- 
time 
jobs and 
full-lime 

enrollment in school. I don't know 
how you do it. You should proba- 
bly be the one writing this. In any 
event, it all amounts to not having 
enough lime for anything anymore, 




including ourselves. 

And we know it's only going to 
gel worse; we know this is just ihe 
beginning So what can we do to 
keep our stress level down'.' 

First, let's identify some things 
thai seem to make our stress levels 
higher than they need to be. For 
instance, I procrastinate writing my 
papers. 1 do this because I simply 
can't write ahead of ihe schedule. 
Also because 1 lend lo do my besi 
writing when it's crunch time. I'm 
not sure why this is - I just know 
that's how it is. 

I'd like lo believe thai for the 
month I knew the paper was due. I 
was writing it in my bead, thinking 
things through This is understand- 
able though. However. I can't 
understand some of the other things 
lhat I do to procrastinate. 

For instance, often limes I'll have 
projects, etc, due the next day and I 
know I have lo start soon, but it 
seems I just keep waiting for some- 
thing lo kick me in gear. Or, I might 
just decide it's a perfcel time to 
clean out all of my drawers. 
Obviously these are pointless things 
that only cause more stress. 

I'm willing to let go of these 
habits for a more stress-free lifestyle 
though. Lately I've been taking 
note of what relieves stress for me 
and whatdoesn'l. 

What works for me is to calm 
down, to breathe in deeply and refo- 
cus my thoughts. A lot of people 
who know me associate me with a 
whirlwind because I'm always on 
the go, For the most pan that's true. 
so in order for me lo 
calm down I 
have to make 
things quiet 
and peaceful 

I like 
make things 
peaceful 
around me, so 
I will unplug 
the phone, 
make some 

coffee and sit in front of what il is I 
have to do. 

This is a good on-the-spot stress 
reliever but sometimes we're deal- 
ing with a conglomeration of things 
thai have just built up over time. 

Sometimes the biggest stress 
reliever is to just get away Take a 
nice drive out m toe country and 
soak it all up Enjoy the simplicity 
of nature's beauty while putting 
things in perspective. This works 
wonders for me, try it. 

Also, I've found that mosi of my 
stress comes from worrying about 
what 1 have yet to do. If I could just 
dig into what I have to do. things 
would be a lot easier for me. 

So for me Ihe real problem is just 
getting started After that 1 remind 
myself thai with every step I take 
the closer I am to being done with ii 
and back lo what's important to me. 

Think about it, aren't things less 
stressful when things are made sim- 
ple? 

So hang in there and prepare 
yourself for what's to come. We're 
all in this together.

Playwright conference 
to include workshops 



by Jeremy Ec«nbarRer 
News Editor 

A book requires a large amount 
of 'h' ■t.n and patience from an 
author A magazine or newspaper 
requires the writer lo slate the 
facis and lo consolidate A 
scriptwriter musi come up with 
interesting dialogue, a specific 
sense of the scenery and millions 
upon millions of other things 
Well, now a workshop has been 
set up to help aspiring play- 
wrights.

hosting the Indiana Theatre 
Association's (ITA) annual con- 
ference, a weekend- long program 
focused on developing new scripts 
by Indiana playwrights.

tion for the event. It will also be

interested in theater 

During the weekend, there will

ITA presidenl, IPFW associate 
professor of theater and interim 
chair of the IPFW department of 
music. "Actors, writers, dancers 
and designers all work on scripts

the process," said Sarratore. 

The facilitator and dramaturge 
for the conference is Len Mozzi. 
direclor of Creativity Unlimited, a 
training and consulting firm for 
business and education. Mozzi 
developed the system "Ten

Rollerblade rally quiet 



by Paul Tupper 
Editor 

They came They saw. They 
signed. They left. 

The rollerblade rally that took 
place near Ketller last Thursday 
went off without a hitch No arrests 
were made No fights broke out. 
Nearly 50 people attended the rally 
which drew much of the local 
media. Students who supported the 
issue signed a petition to keep 
rollerblading privileges on campus 

Currendy, students are permitted 
to rollerblade on campus for trans- 
portation purposes only in low traf- 
fic areas. According to Scott Argast, 
Fort Wayne faculty senator, the 
decision lo change the policy 



regarding rollerblading is that of 
campus administration, which asked 
the University Resource Policy 
Committee for a recommendation 
on the issue The committee recom- 
mended lo limit rollerblading to 
weekends. 

"I don't think students shouldn't 
be able to skate during the week," 
said Gina Burgess, student senate 
pro tern. "Not if the public can skate 
on the weekends." 

Lauren Denbanog, chief of cam- 
pus police and safety, explains the 
proposed ban on rollerblading is a 
safety issue and a liability issue. He 
said not only are innocent people 
getting hurt, but IPFW property is 
being damaged by skaters who do 
acrobatics, not just travel on skates. 



"We get a lot of phone calls and 
e-mails from people who are both- 
ered by the skaters Some have even 
been hurt" said Denhartog. 

Some of those injuries include 
knee injuries and broken collar- 
bones Most of the complaints 
received by campus police arc from 
individuals who have been knocked 
down by bladers. 

However, Stephanie Ule, student 
of hospital administration, believes 
rollerbladers are careful when they 
skate in crowded areas. 

"As a rollerbladcr. you arc aware 
of your surroundings so no one will 
gel burl," said Ule. 

Denhartog understands that some 



of those rollerblading are respectful 
of pedestrians. 

"Some people arc being penal- 
ized who want to abide by the rules, 
but we need enforceable rules," said 
Denhartog 

George Gounaris, student body 
presidenl. made a request to the 
University Resource Policy 
Committee lo reexamine the issue 
based on the amount of student sup- 
port. 

Burgess sees the tough fighi 
ahead for ihe cause. 

"I don'l know if we will win," 
said Burgess "We arc definitely fac- 
ing an up-hill baitle."

Soccer team wins opener 



by Danielle English 
SutT Writer 
and S. Brant Kclky 
Sports Editor 

IPFW Soccer coach Terry 
Siefankiewicz is optimistic about 
his team this year, and a decisive 
loss to one of the nation's betier 
teams last weekend did nothing to 
dampen his confidence. 

Saturday, the Mastodons look on 
Indiana University, Purdue 
University, Indianapolis and won 
the match, 2-1, in overtime, 
Freshmen Justin Labrum and Craig 
Czubik scored while goalkeeper 
Matt Schmitz anchored the defense 
with 20 saves. 

However, Sunday showed the 
way to improvement for the 
Mastodons with a 7-0 loss to top- 
ranked West Virginia Wesleyan 
College. 

Team captain Mike Harper said 
the team was tired from the previ- 



ous day's overtime win. "Everyone 
was tired.'' he said. They [WVU] 
were a very good team. We played 
well, but wc sail lost." 

Presently, IPFW starts five fresh- 
men, but according to 
Siefankiewicz, the team's relative 
youth is no reason for its lopsided 
loss. 

"The team is new, but that is no 
excuse," be said. "This is the best 
team we have ever had in this pro- 
gram The guys arc still learning 
from each other. They are trying to 
get the communication down. Some 
don't know whether be wants the 
ball to face him or to play at his 
feeL" 

Siefankiewicz said be will chalk 
up the WVU match as a teaming 
experience. 

"That team was the NAIA champ 
last year." he said. "We are coming 
together better as a team. I want 
these guys to leave this weekend 
and be proud." 



The team intends to put the loss 
behind them and host the Three 
Rivers Classic soccer tournament 
this weekend at Memorial Stadium. 
The Mastodons will face the 
University of Alabama, 

Birmingham, Saturday at 5:30 p.m. 
and will play again on Sunday 
against Marquette University at 
7:30 p.m. 

'"The University of Alabama, 
Birmingham is a very tall team." 
Siefankiewicz said. "They have a 
center thai is 6'3" from Africa. We 
are going to have to play the ball on 
the ground to get by them, only use 
one or two passes and dribble." 

Harper emphasized the tourna- 
ment's purpose was io gain expo- 
sure for IPFW soccer io the commu- 
nity. 

"This [the tournament] is a 
chance to come out and see quality 
soccer that not often is available for 
people in this area," be said. 



Cross country teams prepare 
for long-awaited home meet 



by S. Brant Kelky 
Sports Editor 



The IPFW cross country teams 
began their seasons last weekend at 
Indiana Wesleyan University. The 
women's team finished fifth out of 
six teams in a tough running field. 

Spring Arbor College of 
Michigan won the women's race 
with 32 points; five of their runners 
finished in the top 12 positions. 
IPFW finished with 109 points. 
Indiana Wesleyan finished second: 
Bethel College, third; Marian 
College, fourth; IPFW, fifth, with 
St. Francis right behind. 

Kay Pulvei was the top runner 
for tbe Mastodons at eighth place 
with a 19:58 lime Melanie Vamer 



crossed the line 24 seconds later to 
lake lOih place 

The race's top finisher was 
Marian College's Amy Crews with 
a time of 18:49, 20 seconds betier 
than the second-place finisher 

IPFW runners Madeline Roser 
finished 27ih; Mona Mourad. 3 1st; 
Kristin Minick, 33rd; and Andrea 
Harding, 39th. 

The hot afternoon sun con- 
tributed to tbe mediocre running 
times, according to Tillapaugh. "It 
was quite the hot day," Tdlapaugh 
said. "I think we would have had 
better times if it hadn't been so hot." 

Indiana Wesleyan blew away the 
competition, rolling to a 20-potnt 
performance. Second-place finisher 
Spring Arbor came in with 62. 
Bethel College was right behind at

Volleyball team 
learns from first 
weekend 



by S. Brant Kellcy 
Sports Editor 

Experience against battle-hard- 
ened opponents during the first 
week of the season showed the way 
to a better performance for the 
IPFW women's volleyball team last 
weekend The Lady Volleydons 
improved their overall record to _1-4 
after the Norlhwood University 
Tournament 

"1 think we had a good week- 
end," Heffron said. "I think we 
played better this weekend than last 
weekend." 

Heffron's Volleydons started this 
tournament as they began the last, 
with an easy victory over a slight- 
of-hand foe. Great Lakes 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference 
member Saginaw Valley State fell 
15-3, 15-7, 15-7 against a more ath- 
letic IPFW squad. 

"We preity much blew ihem 
away in 50 minutes," Heffron said. 
"We came oui and played pretty 
tough at the start We just seemed 
lo jump on them right away. It was 
pretty similar to the Winona State 
match " 

Indeed, the Volleydons hit nearly 
forty percent of their attempts while 
holding Saginaw to just under two 
percent 10 pull out their first viciory 
against a GLIAC team this year. 

Nent in line was Rollins 
University of Florida 

The Volleydons started the match 
with a different lineup and lost the 
first game, 10-15. 

"We wanted to rest our starters, 
so we started our second group," 
Heffron said. "It would have been 
nicer to see them get a win in the 



first game " 

After the firsl game, however, 
the starting six returned with imme- 
diate results. IPFW rolled away the 
rest of the match, 15-7, 15-6. 15-2. 
According to Heffron, the differ- 
ence between the two teams was 
athletic ability. 

"They were nowhere near as ath- 
letic as we are," Heffron said. "The 
longer the match went, the more we 
pounced on them." 

The viciory parade came to a ball 
in the third match of the tournament 
against the host, Northwood 
University. Heffron described 
Norlhwood, 8-0 and another 
GLIAC member, "Decidedly the 
best team we played this year." 

Still, the Volleydons started (be 
match off fast, winning the first 
game 15-12 But then errors took 
their 10U as the Volleydons lost the 
next three games, 12-15, 1-15, II- 
15. 

"We were in control and we did- 
n't take advantage of the opportuni- 
ties," Heffron said "We ended up 
making some errors, and they got 
on a roll. We weren't passing as 
well (as we had]." 

Despite Nonhwoods athleti- 
cism, the Volleydons could have 
won the match, according to 
Heffron, if Ihey had kept tbe ball in 
play better 

"We ended up making about 10 
service errors too many and 10 hit- 
ting errors too many." 

Among tbe pleasant surprises for 
the tournament were Andi Reichart, 
who bad 20 kills and a 319 hitting 
percentage against Northwood, and 
Karen Brown and Angie Robbins ai 
the outside hitter positions.

Tiger Woods brakes 
through race barrier 




Have you seen the new Nike com- 
mercial featuring Tiger Woods? 
Man, is it awesome. 

In case you live in a shoe, Tiger 
Woods is the twenty-year-old golfer 
who won three amateur titles before 
turning pro. Nike signed him to a 
contract worth $40 million. 

Tiger Woods is also black 

The ad from Nike is brilliant. It 
shows home movies of Tiger play- 
ing golf as a child. Tiger's words 
appear on-screen explaining who be 
is and some of his accomplish- 
ments All of this is shown in com- 
plete silence Bui the controversy is 
not about bis stals 

As we see more scenes of Tiger 
playing golf, this time as a young 
adult. Nike plays what has been 
called "Ihe race card." The words on 
the screen lell of his struggles as an 
African- American golfer who, 
although he is ihe prominenl golf 
player of his generation, is still 
asked 10 leave certain country club 
golf courses across the couniry 
because of tus skin color 

Let me say it again. Brilbant. 

Tbe commercial ends with ihe 
words "I've beard I'm noi ready for 
you. Are you ready for me?" 

Bmlianl Simply awesome. 

Bui some in the black community 
- and I'm assuming in tbe white 
community as well - feel Nike is 
exploiting Tiger and bis color and is 



trying to force the 
issue of lack of 
black athleles in 
golf 1 disagree. 
I applaud 
Nike's support for 
such an incredible 
talenL I also agree 
the world of golf 
is lacking color. 
So why shouldn't 
Nike use its 
money 10 help 
bring ibis issue to 
tbe nation's attention? The discus- 
sion must start somewhere and I 
think Tiger Woods is an excellent 
place lo start. 

k always amazed me that race - in 
1996 - is such a big problem, bui it 
is. Blacks are siill targeted by ihe 
police more often than whites. 
Latinos still can't find good jobs. 
Asians still aren't accepted in many 
social circles. Bui all of this is not 
more prevalent than ai country 
clubs I've only played golf once, 
bui the particular course I played 
still had black lawn jockeys as out- 
door decor This offended me. 

If Nike is playing the race card, by 
all means, il's about lime. If this 
commercial raises racial awareness 
and forces people to ask questions, 
great Il's needed, now more than 
ever. 

Hopefully, Tiger will be able lo do 
what no other person has been able 
10, and that is open ihe doors for 
golfers of color. 

Uniil Tiger, I always thought 
blacks didn't like playing golf. 
Anthony Bouvier, a character on 
"Designing Women." once said, 
"Blacks don'i play golf because no 
self-respecting black man would 
wear those clothes." 

With Nike involved, and Tiger 
Woods leading the way, I expect 
that to change.

Women's tennis 
team starts on 
long, bumpy road 



New coach optimistic 



by S. Brant Ketky 
Sports Editor 

The women's lennis team started 
off this season slowly last Thursday 
against Indiana Wcsleyan 
University and things didn't speed 
up much from Ihcrc. 

The team started off with two 
team losses in ihree days, the sec- 
ond against Indiana University- 
Purdue University at Indianapolis. 

"We played two teams thai are 
better than we are," IPFW coach J, 
Webb Horion said. "I can'i com- 
plain about Ihe kids' effort," 

On Thursday, IWU cruised lo a 
9-0 meet win over the Mastodons as 
one of its singles players and one of 
iis doubles learns won by forfeit. 

"We're jusi really shortbanded 
right now," Honon said. He added 
thai be is looking for additional 
players to round oul his squad for 
this season. 

On Saturday, IPFW's squad 



played belter, but was slill swept 9- 
by IUPU1. which Honon 
described as a "pretty good tennis 
learn." 

"We played betler on Saturday 
than on Thursday," Horion said. 

With such a haphazard start to 
the season. Horion is looking to the 
home stretch rather than an impres- 
sive record. 

"I told ihe girls, 'The season is a 
marathon, not a sprint, '" Horton 
said. "We changed a lol of things on 
these kids." 

Hoping lo be competitive when 
the Great Lakes Valley Conference 
tournament rolls around near the 
end of October, Horton is not laying 
ihe base for future success which is 
resulting in some present growing 
pains. Until some aspects of bis 
players' revised styles of play 
become second nature, Ihe ad jus 1- 
ment period will be rough. But he 
says. "There's a good future here." 




Melissa Hasler, of the Women's tennis team, practices her forehand. 



Announcement 



IPFW lennis coach J. Webb Horton is looking for additional women lo 
fdl his rosier for this fall. Presently, he has five players and he needs nine 10 
fill a complele rosier He would welcome even more, however. If you are 
interested, please call the athletic department at (219) 481-6643 or contact 
Horion either before tennis practice ai 4 p.m. or afier practice at 6 p.m. 



"I love boxing. You have iwo guys wearing satin shons and gloves, 

fighting over a belt. And the winner gels a purse. 

Il's ihe accessory connection I love." 

- John McGivem, comedian
