A conservative estimate 



Student President against Moratorium 



I have bet!ii askL'd lo clve my 
viawB on the moratorium, both 
otflclally and privately. 

0(flc;lally, i feel that each 
student should (let ermine for 
himself whether hP should march 

debate, except by pxpresslng my 
personal views In a small flyer, 
because 1 [eel as Sludanl Body 
presldeni, 1 represent the entire 
Gtmlent body uhlc^h was much too 
divorsllled for me to take an 
(iKIclal position. 1 tell 1 could 
not separate my personal and 
niriclal roles to the exienl need- 
ed lo voice my opinions publicly. 

TIr' Student Assembly, as a 
body, roll the same as landvoled 
a non-lnler[orence policy In the 
moratorium. However, as Indivi- 
dual senators, Ihey felt Ihey could 
tnilet'd represent I he student body 
and Ks many diverse opinions 
and therefore, as Individuals and 
senators, they entered the debate. 

They did In fact represent the 
sludenl body In that there were

trylnc lo end ihu war and needs

It puts too much pressure on

Student Government Comment 



by Mai1( Souder 
President, Student Senate 



As one of the "few senators" 
who helped to organize the In- 
famous Leadership Retreat, It 

behind It, the methods of selec- 
tion, what took place, and the 
believed success of the retreat. 
The Leadership Reireai was 

successful retreat was held two 
years agOi, The retreat held last 
year resulted In some sludeni 
government [lEhting, The Idea of 
taking selected freshmen was 
dropped after Iho (irsl year. 

When the Stiideni Assembly 
was asked to allocate $700 (or a 
Leadership Retreai last spring, 
WW referred II lo commlllee. 
Qolller, .Mike Nusbaumer,

represented the Union Board. 
With requested and appr&gt;&gt;ctaled 
help from Dr. Manges and hours 
of studying, plannlnf, and re- 
vlewlnj; thn Idea, the cjDmnilliee 

S?0O (or a Leadership Retreat. 
Only one senator voted acalnst 

We decided that ther.^ should 
be ihree major goals: 1) Initiate 

iDio student government, 2) fur- 
ther develop presenl student 
"leaders" and 3) recomtnend 
solutions for solving present 
lampus problems. 

The malor problem was de- 
termining who .&lt;ihould l&gt;e Inviied. 
Those students servUlg i-ither on 
the Senate or the Union Hoard 
were Invited as well as other 
leaders such as Cordell Mathleu, 
Student Body President, and Ron 
Rice of Project Abelard. Dean 
ManEC-i .s-pent the weekend with 



us, as (lid Dr. onwood from llie 
Purdue faculty and Dr. Harper 
from Indiana, Dr. Frledel from 
PIT also attended. Dean Smith 
and Dean Hroylos each spoke at 

How does one rhoose twenty- 
five freshmen from approximate- 
ly nineteen hundredT We con- 
sidered many methods and fin- 
ally settled on a combination. We 
first limited It to only those 
freshmen attending orientation. 
Of those, we sorted out atiout 
two hundred to interview. Then 
about twenty-five of those inter- 
viewed were selected. 

This may .seam arbHr3ry,but 
one doesn't invest six hundred 
dollars In students who have 
never, In the past, dc'monstrated 
oulstattdlng leadership qualities. 
It's true that there wilt be "late- 
one before "blooms". 

We feel the Leadership Re- 
treat was surn-s.sfiil. The pre- 
sent student leaders learned 
much, as well as getllne many 
excellent suggestions and pro- 
posed solutions. .\Iain of the 

Idenced by Ihe staff of this new s- 

At the same lime, we urge 
students Interested in Student 
Government or the Studeni Union 
Board to Join. Just because you 
didn't attend the Leadership Re- 
treat doesn't make you incapable 
of being In Student Government. 
We are considering haUng anoth- 
er open Leadership Training Ses- 

urge you to come to Room 104 
because, unfortunately, '• late- 
bloomers" look a lot like card- 
playnrs. 




- Ine, well dressed, and solidly 



more dedicated lo conserva-

I do not mean to say tliai the 
young conservatives have cap-

they had, Hugh Scoii would not

evidence I clle "Duk" Lukens, 
Fulton t^wls 111, "Bill" Rich-

Goldwater, Jr., Phil Crane, etc. 

Thus, I feel It Is my duty to 
warn the old guard Republicans, 
off guard Democrats, and miscel- 
laneous morons CLIndsay, Percy, 
and Brooke) that a ticket com|»s- 
ed of young conservatives Is very 
possible In 197G. 



Letters 
to the editor 



Dear Ediior, 

I Would like lo consralulato 
you and ihe Communicator staff 
for tlie (bie coverage of the two 
major views cuncenilng the re- 
cent .Maralorlum. However, (or 
clarity, I think that the purposes 
of S.A. M, should be further ex- 
plained. 

As thename(SiudentsAB»insl 
the Moraiorlum) implies, this 
organization opposes the ^to^a- 
lornim Iwcause It Is felt that 
the Moratorium places stress In 
the wrong place, namely Ihe pre- 
senl admlnlstrallon. Instead of 
the Communists In North Viet- 
nam, Also, the purpose of S.A. M. 
Is to back the policies of Iho 
prosenl government and the peace 
negotiations In Paris.

Wh, In audents Against the 
Moraiorlum, (eel our campaign 
was sucfessful, especially con- 
sidering ihal SAM was only of- 
ficially formed lasl Tuesday. 
While the damage was done lo 
the p('acp effort, as shown l)y 
North Vietnam's enthusiastic en- 
dorsement of the Moratorium, 
we feel we demonstrated that 
here In Fnri Wayne studeniopln- 
ion was divided on trii issue, 
SAM distributed about 5,000 bro- 
chures and flyers In Ihe local 

at the Indiana- Purdue campus. 
We also had distributed all GOO 
of our Co to Class stickers by 
early Wednesday morning. 

While somewhere between COO 
and 300 people attended the Mora- 
torium sessions at the Indiana- 
Purdue campus, which is an ad- 
mittedly significant number, tha 
total was balloned by curious 
high school kids, many of whom 
were merely taking the occass ion 
lo skip school. The total attend- 

lunlor high and high school stu- 
dents. This means the Indepen- 
dent Students Union spokesman 
who was quoted by the press

Other pro - moraiorlum 
spokesman had estimated class 
attendance would be off by 40%- 
60^. SAM checked class atten- 
dance from early mornlni! on 
thru Wednesday evening, and 
while In some classes attendance 
was 40rfl-60ri off, the average 
percentage drop from normal 
was about 105. In some classes, 
attendance was higher than nor- 

Sludents Against the Mora- 
torium, lo quote a bmousAmer- 
Ican, has "not yet begun to 
fight." The national Vietnam 
Moratorium Committee vowsthat 
they will continue escalaiing 
their protests every month until 
the war Is ended. It's some- 
what of a self- fulfilling suie- 
ment, seeing as they are help- 
ing to prolong the war, SAM 
will continue our battle. The 
students aren't one-stiot "glory- 
mongers," SAM Is fighting a
