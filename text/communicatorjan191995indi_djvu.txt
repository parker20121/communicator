SAB member questions 
referendum's legality 



By Nol T. Beckley 
News Editor 

SAB member, Kerry Adkins, 
has petitioned the IPSGA Judicial 
Branch lo look into Ihe legality of 
the referendum which passed in 
1994. 

Adkins has questioned the con- 
stitutionality of the way Ihe 
polling was held. 

Director of Communications 
Jerry Richardson has questioned 
the legitimacy of Adkins' peti- 
tion. 

Richardson said, "I think [Ihe 
referendum] was our best election 
ever. 

"I think we can prove that we 
sincerely did our best to present ... 
a free and fair election by every 
standard we know." 

Adkins said, "During the 
IPSGA elections, students have a 



two-or three-week notice prior to 
the vole. For the technology fee 
referendum, students only had 
one working day." 

Richardson said all students 
had an equal opportunity to vole. 
"We had ballot boxes at four dif- 
ferent buildings and we had twice 
the voting turnout we usually do." 

Adkins also said he resented 
Internet and technology fee pam- 
phlets being distributed at the 
same table where the ballot boxes^ 
were placed. 

"TTie IPSGA consUluUon sUtes 
that for senate elections all candi- 
date propaganda must be at least 
10 to 15 feel away from the ballot 
boxes," said Adkins. 

Richardson said, "I think tliis is 
a non-issue. We gave an equal 
amount of information ... We 
made it clear that there are advan- 
tages and also disadvantages." 



Adkins said he also disliked 
the fact that the referendum was 
held during "dead week." 

He said he doesn't oppose the 
technology fee, but the way the 
voting took place. 

"I want to stop the current 
technology fee because I don't 
feel (IPSGA President Mark) 
King got the best deal from the 
university," slated Adkins. 

Richardson said. "I think it 
would be wrong to disregard the 
students who voted." 

Adkins said, "My goal is to 
come up with a better way to fund 
Internet," 

Adkins said he felt the only 
way he could stop King from 
going to the board of trustees was 
to file a petition through the judi- 
cial branch. He said he was wor- 
ried that King would take the 
technology fee proposal to the 



board without first seeking the 
approval of the IPSGA. 

No IPSGA meetings are sched- 
uled until next month. The board 
of trustees also meets sometime 
next month, 

Richardson said, "It's Ihe 
responsibility of the judicial 
branch to look al this ... I Ihink we 
can prove the allegations are 
false." 

Adkins said, "I feel it's time to 
serve the students and I hope this 
petition creates a lot of interest 
and involvement among IPF^ 
students." 

Sources within the IPSGA said 
they believe this is a political 
move by Adkins to posture him- 
self into running for IPSGA 
President. 

IPSGA President Mark King is 
out of town this week and was 
unavailable for comment

Vanderbilt University, delivered 
the moving speech, "Continuing 
the Search for the Beloved 
Community," in the Walb 
Ballroom on Friday. Jan. 13.

injustices?" Baldwin reinforced

Payne Drown, Fort Wayne safely 
director and at-largc member of the 
Fon Wayne Community School 
Board, named low graduation rates 
and drMg use as major problems in 
area high schools, 

"Clearly, to me. in terms of 
becoming viable, contributing mem- 
bers of this society, education is the 
key," said Brown. 

"If there's a large segment of our 
population that's not being educated. 
... somewhere society is going to 
have to deal with them." added 
Brown. 

Leann Hari-Hoover, assistant 
principal at Elmhursi High School 
said, "It amazes me thai in 1995 stu- 
dents drop out of high school." 

Hart-Hoover added, "Every kid 
who leaves. 1 keep track of them." 
She also sends letters to every stu- 
dent who has dropped out which lells 
them how to re-enroll in school. 

She also feels fortunate that 
FWCS has the Anihis Career and 
other programs such as the expectant 
mothers program. 

"Without these programs. I feel 
more students would be dropping 
out," said Han- Hoover. 

Brown cued a Journal-Gazette 
repon that menuoned one local high 
school with a dropout rale of 42 per- 
cent. 



Brown expressed genuine 
about what happens to these leens. 

He believes dealing with fresh- 
men entering high school would be a 
cheaper economic solution, 

Hart-Hoover discounts some of 
those figures because some students 
who drop out and return a semester. 
The figures do not take into account 
transfer students. 

"Today, kids seem to be transient 
when it comes to school. ..there arc 
many inier-district transfers," 
explained Hart-Hoover. 

"I don't feel a student who drops 
out for a semester and then comes 
back should be counted as a drop- 
out," added H art -Hoove r. 

Boih Drown and Hart-Hoover 
agreed that parent involvement is 
essential. 

"Wc need support from home, 
because one dropout is too many." 
stated Hart-Hoover. 

"We are going to have to start 
raising the level of expectation of 
students in terms of academic perfor- 
mance," said Brown, 

"Our standards are substantially 
lower dian die rest of the world; in 
Japan you go to school 240 days a 
year, in Germany, you go to school 
230 days a year, and here you go 180 
days per year." he said. 

Other countries require a foreign 
language, "h's clearly not mandato- 
ry here." said Brown. 

"Teachers have to be held more 



accountable for the performance of 
students; administrators have to be 
held more accountable for the perfor- 
mance of students and teachers and 
administrators' expectations of stu- 
dents have to be higher." said 
Brown. 

Brown added, "We also need to 
be honest with kids and say to them. 
'High school IS nol the goal; you 
need some skill that the world is 
willing 10 pay for." 

Brown also said that educators 
need to tell students that life is not 
supposed to be easy and warn stu- 
dents about "buying into a false real- 
ity." 

Drugs and violence in school also 
concern Brown, "There is a very 
high level of frustration in young 
people and that leads to violence." 
added Brown. 

"We need to create an environ- 
ment where people want to be (at 
school] and want to be educated." 
explained Brown. 

Brown mentioned using dogs in 
locker searches while students are in 
Ihe classroom to help eradicate the 
drug problem in schools. 

"Once you find the dope in ihe 
locker, what do you do with the 
childT' he said. 

Brown described two ways to 
deal with ihe problem. One way to 
deal with the situation is on a criiBi- 
nal level and the other way is ai die 
administrative level. 



King's belief in economic power. 

"Freedom without economic 
power is worthless," said Baldwin. 

King would be disappointed 
with the level of racism and vio- 
lence today, according to Baldwin. 

"I think that Baldwin addressed 
something that isn't usually dis- 
cussed during King's birthday," 
said Director of Multi-Cultural 
Affairs for Student Government. 
Chris Douse. 

"Everyone focuses on King's 
views about integration and for- 
gets his devotion toward Ihe 
beloved community." added 
Douse. 

"Some scholars believe the 
beloved conununity was the main 
cusp of King's philosophy." said 
Baldwin. 

Baldwin said liiai King was a 
man who symbolized possibilities 
and who showed the people of the 
world how to live with a purpose. 

Baldwin also believes King 
would be preaching his iiics.sage if 
alive today, and would be "active 
in the fight against sexism, homo- 
phobia, and AIDS discrimination." 

Fred Kirchoff, vice chancellor 
of academic affairs, said, "We are 
honored to have a speaker with the 
level of authority on Martin 
Luther King Jr. that Mr. Baldwin 
does." 

Baldwin gave the keynote 
address of the Manin Luther King 
Jr. Memorial Celebration. 

Baldwin has become one of the 
leading scholars on Kingian phi- 
losophy and has written several 
well-known books on King and 
his teachings. 

Also in attendance were Rep. 
Mark Souder. Chancellor Mike 
Wariell. and Fort Wayne Safety 
Director Payne Brown, 

The Taylor University-Upland 
Gospel Choir sang several uplift- 
ing numbers. Paulina Salvador, 
advisor of Hispanic students in 
IPFW's multi-cultural service, 
called their singing "a beautiful 
musical tribute."

Housing needed? 



Despite the fact that IPFW is. 
and has always been a commuter 
campus, (he idea of building hous- 
ing on campus Is still brought up as 
a possibtlily. We al The 
Communicaior Ihink (hat the 
adminisiralion should Torgct tbe 
idea of building bousing on cam- 
pus, unless they could find a lype 
of bousing Uiat would fn Ihc needs 
of the campus without changing ihe 
way the campus functions now. 

This campus is designed to be 
easily accessible by auiomobJe not 
by fooL How would the needs of 
the siudenis living on campus be 
, mci? Tbc University would have to 
provide a parking space for every 
student housed since on-campus 
students would need a car because 
so LitJc is accessible by fool. Is this 
feasible? How would thai effect the 
present parking situation? 

At the present time, the majority 
of students on campus are taking 
classes as well as working. Many of 
these students are part-time. Their 
social and recreational needs are 
met outside of campus. If housing 
was provided on campus, would 
more students take classes full-time 
and therefore expect the university 



to provide them with a variety of 
social and recreationai opponuni- 
ties? If the University did change to 
meet the needs of the new resident 
students, how would th^ affect the 
rest of the students, who wouldn't 
benefit from the increased opporru- 
nitjcs. but would probably end up 
paying for them? 

Last but not least, how great is 
the demand for on-campus hous- 
ing? If housing was available, 
would the students who lived on 
campus be students who would 
have gone lo IPFW anyway, or 
would they be students who would 
have gone elsewhere? 

One of the main reasons that 
IPFW has as large a smdent popu- 
lation as it does is because it is 
unique in that many of its classes 
are offered at night, and many of iLs 
programs are geared lo returning 
students. The only way the admin- 
istration should consider providing 
on-campus housing is if it can find 
a way to provide affordable apart- 
ment-type housing to students who 
would have come here anyway but 
would not have had the financial 
resources to get an apartment in Ft. 
Wayne, 



Social, recreational and 
cultural standard too strict 



The decision by the administra- 
tion to prohibit the Indiana-Purdue 
Student Government Association 
from funding individual groups 



did the administration decide to 
pick on this one? Because it was 
inconvenient for them and they 
didn't want to have any way to 



travel is just another example of make sure it wasn't abused. Instead 



how our administration is blind to 
the needs of its diverse student 
body. 

When a student group ^plied to 
have a trip funded the group had to 
show that they were paying part of 
the expense, and then they had to 
justify every dime they wanted the 



of letting Oie IPSGA decide how 
they would legulaie it, they just cut 
it out all together, eliminating 
another avenue for students to get 
some kind of return on the money 
they pay in Student Activities Fees. 
What will the administration do 
next? Cut out child-care referrals 



IPSGA to pay for. For example, if because it isn't cultural, recreation- 



students wanted to be reimbursed 
for gas. -then they had to save every 
receipt and turn it in lo the IPSGA, 
who then handed it over to the busi- 
ness office This generated a lot of 
paperwork for the business office. 
So the administration decided to do 
away with it altogether. 

They didn't talk to anyone at 
IPSGA, and they didn't check to 
find out how many groups used this 
money to fund trips they wouldn't 
be able to take without this finan- 
cial assistance. They just did it. 

Tbey justified this change in pol- 
icy by a section of the Student 
Services Fee Manual that reads: 
"...Student Services Fee income 
may be used to provide support for 
... university approved cultural, 
recreational, and social programs 
which contribute to a well-rounded 
student life." 

Someone could argue that many 
of the services provided by the stu- 
dent government are neither cultur- 
al, recreational or social, so why 



social? Students on this cam- 
pus are diverse, and they have 
diverse needs. The student govern- 
ment has attempted to come up 
with different programs to meet the 
needs of different students. 
Although some students may never 
ask for money to go to off-campus 
events, these same students may 
take advantage of the Gales 
Athletic Center, the free food give- 
ways or the transitional studies 
office. This is how they are served. 
The administration should not 
administer policy affecting students 
solely for iLs own benefit. If they 
continue to limit the services the 
student goverimient is able to pro- 
vide on the basis that they are not 
cultural, recreational or social when 
many students were in fact benefit- 
ing from these services, then maybe 
the administration needs to look at 
its definition and see if it really 
addresses the needs of this diverse 
student body.

University criticized for dismissing professor 



Dear Editor. 

I found out last November 
through a friend that one of the best 
professors in the psychology 
department and maybe IPFW will 
be officially terminated after the 
spring semester. I was told that the 
termination of this professor is due 
to her lack of published primary 
research. I find this news very sad- 
dening. I am sure that I would have 
given up my college goals after 



being at IPFW for only two years. 
but she would not let me give up on 
myself. She believed in me She 
even allowed me to vent my frustra- 
tion in her office on a number of 



I cannot argue that she is a tough 
ptofes.sor and she expects a lot from 
her students. However, she honestly 
wants her students to learn and she 
is wilhng to invest lime in her stu- 
dents if they are interested. She 



does what all educators should be 
doing, in my opinion, but she is 
being fired for it! This makes no 
sense lo me! 

Unfortunately, the politics of the 
academic setting quickly teaches 
educators that they should spend 
more time doing research and writ- 
ing, to become well known and 
make the university look good, if 
they want to keep their jobs. I have 
seen educators who do not care 



about teaching or about whether 
students learn. They put their 
required time in and no more. This 
is a disservice lo students, especial- 
ly those who have a desire to Icam! 
Why aren't the students the priority 
in schools? The priorities of the 
administration are really messed up 
(to say the least) and need to be 
changed!

Government rapes Fort Wayne 



V. Michael 
Smith 



In Sunday's Journal Gazette, 
Debra Noell and Lesley Stedman 
documented the dropping of zinc 
cadmium sulfide on Fort Wayne in 
1964. llie chem- 
icals were 
dropped until 
1966. The army 
didn't know the 
effects of this 
chemical: the 
Pentagon wanted 
10 sec the chemi- 
cal effects on a 
city the size of 
Fort Wayne. 

Does the 
~~'^^^~^^^~ U. S. govern- 
ment bcnefn or harm American citi- 
zens? If you live in Ft. Wayne, the 
government feel^t^an infest our 
city wiin cncmical weapons the army 
needs to lest on people. 

The tesiing raises serious ethical 
questions, such as: does the Pentagon 
see American citizens as caiile to be 
tested, prodded and slaughtered?: 
were the government officials 
involved with this project afraid of 
the American military complex to 
stand up for the people who elected 
them or were they thankful thai the 
testing didn't happen in their dis- 
trict? Aren't we all Americans? Are 
citizens residing in the perfect test 
location somewhat less than 
Americans? 

How did we get the dubious 
honor of being the U. S. govern- 
ment's guinea pigs? 1 thought that 
privilege went places like the Bikini 
Island in the Pacific Ocean. 

This blatant disregard for the hves

of U. S. citizens should not go 
unpunished. Just because we are 
from Fort Wayne, does our home- 
town make us any less human? Does 
being a Hoosier make us the perfect 
test subjects? Why didn't the govern- 
ment test our neighbors to the east? 
Are Ohio Buckeyes too important to 
bombard with chemicals? I don't 
even Uke roost Buckeyes, my opin- 
ion is they are more expendable than 
Hooslers. When was the last time die 
Buckeyes won the NCAA champi- 
onship? My bet is they won the lour- 
nament in the sixties, while Hoosiers 
were being invaded by the govern- 
ment. Was Toledo too good for zinc 
cadmium? Obviously, Cleveland was 
left out of the decision process. 
Everyone knows their city govern- 
ment does all the chemical testing on 
their own citizens 

Let us not forget that there have 
been presidents born in Indiana, 
Maybe that is why the government 
felt Indiana was expendable. Who 
chose Fori Wayne as a test site? I 
wonder if some bureaucrat in 
Washington was jilted by a woman 
living in Fort Wayne and this was 
the only way he knew how to exuaci 
revenge. Maybe Fort Wayne lost a 
coin loss with Terre Haute. Who 
knows? 

In all seriousness, as citizens of 
the United States, we should exercise 
our right to have full disclosure of all 
the facts. We also have the right lo 
file a class action suii against the 
government. I feel betrayed by the 
leaders of the country where 1 live. I 
may nol have been alive al the time 
the chemicals were dropped, but I 
have many friends who have older 
brothers and sisters who may have 
been affected by zinc cadmium sul- 
fide. We don't know all the side 
effects of this chemical are and the 
government claims the health threats 
are 'Negligible." but health agencies 
do not recommend continued use of 
zinc cadmium sulfide. Why should I 
(or anyone) inisi ihe government's 
word? 

Many IPFW readers probably 
cannot relate due to their age, but 
remember your parents may have 
lived in Fon Wayne during the six- 
lies and they conceived you after 
being infested with zinc cadmium 
sulfide: you do the maihl

Sophomore forward Dana 
Morningstar led NKU with 17 
points on 7-of-l2 field-goal 
shooting and three free throws 
made of five attempts. She led 
nine Norse into the scoring col- 
umn as NKU shot 49 percent 
from the field. 

The Norse outrebounded 
IPFW 38-30 and the teams com- 
bined for 40 turnovers. 

In the game, guard Lindy 
Jones became Just the sixth play- 
er in IPFW history to score 
LOGO points in her career. She 
had previously scored 975 and 
her 29 on Thursday put her four

In the second game, the 
Mastodons trampled the Norse 
in the first half and cruised to a 
victory, 84-75. 

IPFW oulscored NKU 48-29 
in the first half, shooting 52 per- 
cent from the field, including 6- 
of-13 ihree-poim attempts. The

IPFW teams lack 
fan support

Edilor-in-Chief 

The Mastodons continued 
■ heir trend of splitting on 
Saturday, Jan. 14 as the 
University of Indianapolis defeat- 
ed ilic Lady 'Dons in a close 
game and the 'Dons won in the 
last four seconds. 

The Lady 'Dons started off 
slowly in the first half, but 
returned from a time out lo pull 
ahead by 10 points with two min- 
utes left in the first half. 
However, die Greyhounds came 
back to end the half with a ihree- 
poini deficit, 44-41. IPFW played 
even with Indianapolis until the 
final Iwo-and-a-half minutes, 
when the Greyhounds ran away 
from the Lady 'Dons to win. 88- 
79. 

Seven Lady 'Dons played at 
least 17 minutes. Coach Pam 
Bowden said IPFW became tired 
toward the end of the game. The 
Lady 'Dons were depleted with 
injuries; Sophomore DoiUe Porch 
did not play and will be out with 
illness until at least next 
Saturday's game, Jennie 
Newhard played with a sore eye 
after scratching it in practice on 
Monday, and three other players 
are dealing with colds and the fiu. 

Freshman Leah Sheets provid- 



ed a defensive spark off the 
bench. Said Bowden. "She's 
coming in and doing things." 

Bowden said she was pleased 
with IPFW's play during the 
game, especially the defensive 
improvement. "If wc can keep 
playing like that, we'll be in a lot 
more ball games defensively." 
she said. Post defense was still a 
problem, however. 

Bowden praised the 
Greyhound^' play; she said they 
may reach the NCAA tournament 
this year. Indianapolis used a sti- 
fling press to help force 18 
turnovers. Outside of dealing 
with backcourt defensive pres- 
sure, however, the offense was 
fine, according to Bowden. 

Lindy Jones was the leading 
scorer for the Lady 'Dons with 
29 points, 12 from thrce-polni 
range. Tara Muzzillo was the 
leading reboundcr with nine, 
while Jennie Newhard had five 
blocks to break former Lady 
'Don Pam Edwards' career mark 
of 80, Newhard ended the game 
with 82. 

The loss dropped IPFW's 
women's record to 1-4 in the 
GLVC. "It's frustrating." 
remarked Bowden in reference lo 
the fact three of those four losses 
were by less than 10 points. 

The Mastodons started Iheir 
game off fast, jumping out to 
leads of 10-3. 12-5, and 15-9 
before setUing into a see-saw bat- 



tle and finally upsetting ihc 
Greyhounds by a point, 69-68. 
Indianapolis came into the Gates 
Center with a 9-1 record. 

Ryan Glidden started the scor- 
ing atwul a minuie and a half Into 
the game with a three-pointer. 
The Greyhounds* David Wicse 
got in close for a lay up secontls 
later to close the score, 3-2. From 
there the 'Dons ran away with the 
game for several minutes. 

Glidden led the way to the 
early lead with six of his 16 
points. He scored those on two 
ihrcc-poinlers and Steve Sanders 
added one in the rxin. The 'Dons 
coasted for the rest of the half 
and led 32-26 at halfU me. 

The second half was wild. 
Indianapolis threatened to take 
over about three minutes inio the 
half, but then IPFW took and 
maintained a three- to seven- 
point lead until the final minute 
and a half. Led by Noi Chay. the 
Greyhounds closed the gap and 
took a one-point lead with sec- 
onds to go, IPFW coach Andy 
Piazza called a time-out. ran a 
play and got the ball to K.C. 
Runyan with four seconds to 
play. 

Indianapolis was ted by Bart 
Holubar and Chay with 17 points 
apiece. Chay hit the three-pointer 
with 18 seconds to go to give the 
Greyhounds their last lead, set- 
ting up the events leading lo 
Runyan's crucial free throws.

I went to ihe men's and women's 
basketball games lasi Saturday, and I 
was rather disturbed at the lack of 
fan support for the 'Dons at home. 
The numbers did noi aliogeiher sur-

breaker and a game won in die finaJ

To our 
shame, the 

attendance at 
the "Dons' away 
games has been 
more than dou-

darken Ihc doors of the Gates

The average attendance at two 
men's conference games at 
Bellarmine College and Kentucky 
State University was 1370. Three

and Ashland University averaged

The enrollment ai these schools, 
all GLVC members, is 2700. 2550 
and 5000. respectively; these num- 
bers pale considerably to the nearly 
12,000 students who attend IPFW.

receive an al-iargc bid (o the Final 
Four, and fell again to Ball State 
in the consolation match. The 
MIVA tournament champion 
receives an automatic bid to the 
volleyball Final Four tournament. 

The new leader for the 
M)IIeydons will be senior Felipe 
Ralat, another Puerto Rican and 
an honorable mention All- 
American last year. 



Other returning sianers will be 
sophomore swing hiiier Ricardo 
Soler, a sometimes .starter as a 
freshman, who will t&gt;e solid on 
the outside. 

Senior opposite hitter Craig 
Collins also returns to start for the 
fourth straight year. He is current- 
ly ninth on IPFW's all-time kill 
list, and was a second-team all- 
MIVA selection as a junior. 

IPFW Coach Amie Ball antici- 
pated starting junior swing hitter 
Brad Prieditis on the outside, but 
a knee injury has likely knocked 
him out for the season. 

Senior setter Scoll Lauer now 
starts in the wake of Lloy Ball's 
graduation. Ball's understudy for 
three years, Lauer started in the 
NCAA championship semifinal 
for the injured Ball against num- 
ber one-ranked UCLA, and per- 
formed ably. Lauer transferred 
from the University of Michigan 
after his freshman year, where he 
was named freshman of die year. 

Mike Ter Molen started mid- 
way through the season last year 
as a freshman middle hitter. 
Coach Ball has now redesignated 
him as the backup setter behind 
Lauer. Ball said he still plans to 
use Ter Molen as a sometime 



Senior set to lead

A new siai. a new season Now 

that Lloy Ball has graduated from 
IPFW and is out of the spoilighi, will 
Scott Lauer. ttic new seller for itic 
men's volleyball team, l&gt;e able lo fill 
the space left by Ball? Who is Scott 
Lauer, anyway, and wliai does he 
think about being in the driver's seal 
of this younger, inexperienced team? 
In an interview with Lauer. these 
questions and more have t&gt;cen asked 
and answered. 

Lauer is now the center of atten- 
tion on the men's volleyball court. 
Some personal data on the new set- 
ter. He's 23 years old, and his degree 
will be in management and maikct- 
iDg. 

When asked what his plans for the 
future were, he replied. "Grad school 
maybe, but I'd like to Join a pro vol- 
leyball league and play for a couple 
of years if the money is good," 

Lauer said his best game last sea- 
son was against Tri-Siaie University 
"As the seller for IPFW. I'd say the 
game in March when we beat Tri- 
Staie 15-0. That was my best game," 
he said. 

What was your worsi game. 
Scott? "Against George Mason — 
don't remember when Uiat was exact- 
ly." 

The request for comments on the 
team for the upcoming season 
brought the most animation from our 
interviewee: "This year we're a lot 
more of a team unit. We're a lot 
smoother now. I was injured in pre- 
season (playing ball in Pueno Rico). 
I hurt my thumb. It's been slow 
going, but I feel pretty good about 
my progress, 

"My main problem has been mov- 
ing itie ball around the way I want lo. 
Sometimes I misdirect my sets and 1 
need to work on that. With my thumb 
and other players' injuries, and the 
lack of playing experience in the 
replacement players (most arc 
replacements) we are off to a rocky 
Stan," he said. 

Lauer sees himself in a different 
role tills year from last year, and dif- 
ferent from his predecessor. He stat- 
ed, "I've always fell that I could 
communicate with Coach Ball. He 
expects a lot out of mc as a player 
and a leader. Not only do I have to 
function in my position as a player, 
but I am also considered to be a 
motivator and the person wbo holds 
the team together in morale and 
drive. 

"I don't consider myself as being 
In tbe same role as Lloy was. Felipe 
and Oaig are captains also, and it's 
my job to keep all of us together in 
terms of each one's responsibilities 
to tbe team. 



Lauer said he expects lo be a lead- 
er on the learn, but not to be dominat- 
ing. "We have a lot of younger play- 
ers coming in because of the injuries 
we've had, and I am letting those two 
share the burden with me." 

Said IPRV coach Amie Ball, "He 
has to identify himself as a team 
leader." 

"All of us function more as sup- 
ports for the team than one man lead- 
ing it. My style of play and leader- 
ship will be my own. as opposed to 




Lauer 

trying to Till anyone's shoes." 

Ball concurred. He said. "He 

needs to be Scott, not fill Lloy's 

shoes." 

Scoit thinks he has what it takes 




L. Ball 



to ptay at the MIVA level. ■ Tve 
learned how lo work under pressure 
in a group situation, and the rigorous 
training involves discipbne thai falls 
over into other areas of my life - ^a- 
demics, worlt and homelife as well," 
he said. 

Scott also talked about his other 
achievements, including sortie recent 
successes: "In the summer of 1993, 1 
went to the Olympic festival in San 
Aoionio, Texas and in 1994 in St. 
Louis and took the bronze metal in 
both. Also, in the United Slates 
Volleyball Association Nationals. 1 
earned All-American honors for '94 
as a setter." Lauer was a member of 
the South team at the 1994 Olympic 
Festival. 



middle hitler 

Sophomore Wayne Williams is 
injured and will be missed as a 
valuable reserve this season. Bail 
said he may have staned Williams 
as a middle hitter, had he been 
healthy. He started in Uie NCAA 
Finals consolation match against 
Ball State and performed capably. 

Ball said the loss of Williams 
and Prieditis affects his team's 
depth. 

Ball recruited five freshmen lo 
shore up his losses for the upcom- 
ing season. David Wilhoit, from 
Ellenwood, Ga,, could start at 
outside hitter wiUi Prieditis out of 
the lineup. 

Justin Luna, a Tennessee 
native who played high-school 
ball at Anoka. Mn. High School, 
should also see significant play- 
ing time at swing hitter. 

Middle hitler Dave Zub of St. 
Louis, Mo. will back up Ralat. A 
transfer from Ball State, he will 
benefit the most from Williams' 
injury, ' 

Jon Huffman, from three-time 
Wisconsin state champion J.I. 
Case High School, may also see 
time as a swing hitter. 

Micheal Hunt, another Georgia 
product, is a middle hitter; he 



placed 2nd in regionals in the 
110-meter hurdles in high school, 
and so may add some athleticism 
to the team. 

By MIVA tournament time, 
hopefully this team will contend 
for another Final Four bid. Ball 
said IPFW is a dark horse for the 



MIVA title this year. However, 
the team should be able to gel 
suffidenQy for the MIVA tourtia- 
ment. 

According to Ball, the main 
contenders for the MIVA title will 
be Ball State, second-year mem- 
ber Lewis University of Illinois, 



then Ohio State University. He 
figured IPFW would finish fourth 
in die MIVA. Quincy University, 
the University of Wisconsin at 
Milwaukee, and Thomas More 
College in Kentucky would fini.sh 
in the second half of the MIVA 
standings, he said.

'Dons kill alumni 

fans get a look at this 
year's team 



By S. Brant Kelley 
Editor-in-Chief 

The IPFW men's volleyball 
leam played the volleyball alumni 
on Friday, Jan. 13 for fans lo lake 
their first look at the team. 

Five matches were played 
between die Volleydons and the 
alumni squad. Second-string 
players played die first two games 
of the match, and first-string 
players then finished the last three 
games. 

The Volleydons won all five 
matches, but the final match 
between the two first strings was 
in doubt until the final three 
points of the match. 

The first team featured such 
famous former 'Dons as Niel Day 
and Tony Luening, among others. 
Players from as long ago as 1979 
were present for the alumni. 

The first two games came easi- 
ly for the second-string 
Volleydons. Beginning in the 
third game, the starters took over. 

The third and fourth games 
were won easily by die 'Dons. In 
the fifth game, however, the 
alumni jumped out to a 6-0 lead 
and maintained a five- or six- 
point lead until they led 11-6. 
Then the 'Dons began lo come 
back. They battled to within two 
at 13-11. then took the lead at 15- 
14. The Alumni scored anodier 
point to tie the game, but then 
couldn't get over the hump, as the 
"Dons scored the last two points 
lo win the final game. 

The Volleydons play their first 
match tomorrow night at the 
Gates Center against George 
Mason University in die second 



match of the Fon Wayne National 
Bank/Pepsi Invitational tourna- 
ment hosted by IPFW. 

The next evening. IPFW plays 
die University of Manitoba, the 
number-one ranked team in 
Canada,

Great Ball of fire! 




By Mclbu Younj; 
StafrWril«r 

The name Grcai Ball of Fire has 
not been besiowcd upon ihc 
Vollcydons coach Amie Ball in 
honor of Jerry Lcc Lewis, bul lo 
bcller describe the inner strenglhs 
and inner enemies Ihat have created 
Ihc man bebind ihc team. 

As Volleydon head coach of fif- 
teen years, Arnie Ball is again 
preparing and educating some of 
the best players in die nation. 

As the years have passed, Ball 
has been able to coach inlemation- 
ally and gain more recruils. "Wc 
have been very fodunale about the 
lasi seven years, Wc have had really 
quality athlclic players as well as 
team athletes. When we first started 
this program, of course, it was a 
club program," Ball said. "We look 
everyone who walked, was a live 
body, and could function. I could 



teach them a litde bit bow lo play 
the game, but jtist about in the last 
seven years we have been able to 
recruit individuals all over the 
world," 

But in preparing some of the best 
players on the globe. Ball has faced 
many challenges. Since the begin- 
ning of the program, Bali has been 
able to mold all-star players. This 
year the team lost two-time MIVA 
most valuable player and current 
U.S. national leam member Lloy 
Ball and Norman Aimodovar, who 
is currently striving to meet his 
Olympic dream. 

Freshmen will dominate in num- 
bers on the team this season, but 
Ball is optimistic and confident He 
believes that leadership is the key lo 
the team's success. Such drive lead- 
ership, according to Ball, needs to 
flow from the three senior 
Volleydons, 

"We've got a real young group. 



Our goal right now is to try to 
iltvelop some unity, to get our three 
seniors to show some leadership 
skills so thai we can compete when 
the season starts," Ball said. "Peer 
pressure gets a lot more done than 
coach pressure sometime. They (die 
seniors) don't get to play next year. 
This is their year so they have to 
move the others along." 

Inexperience, however, is not the 
only hardship the 1995 team has 
bad to face thus far injuries have 
already seized two of the team's 
starters for the season. "We have 
had a really difficult lime with 
injuries. We lost two starters to 
ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) 
injuries. We have seated diem, and 
they won't play at all." Ball said. 

These challenges, however. Ball 
can accept, but he admits that the 
that lack of effort is the kerosene on 
his fuse. The umph put into a play, 
practice, attitude, or school can cre- 
ate a warming glow or ignite an 
explosion. 

"We (die coaching stafO expect 
each member of the team to do dicir 
very best. Some can do better than 
odiers, but the end result is that they 
can all do the same if they train, 
study, go to class, come to the gym 
with die attitude that they want to 
get better every day. That is all we 
can ask," Ball said. "Error giving 
your best is acceptable. Error not 
giving your best is unacceptable." 

When unacceptable errors occur. 
Ball admits that his fuse ignites. 



"Sometimes I get out of control. 
Sometimes I kick players out of 
practice. Sometimes I gei right in 
Uieir faces and holler. Sometimes 
you have to take them by die side 
and handle them differently. You 
just can't yell at anybody," Ball 
said. 

Although Ball boasts that the 
effort through support that the com- 
munity gives the Vollcydons ranked 
number one in the nadon last sea- 
son, the lack of school spirit infuri- 



ates him. "There is no school spirit, 
none. It is worse today that it was 
when I first sianed. That is sad." 
Ball said. 

Ball believes that just because 
IPFW is a commuter school and 
that many students work and/or take 
care of a family, diat is no excuse. 
"Everyone makes excuses, and that 
is garbage," Ball said. 

He says he is delighted lo see the 
many faces painted during Iowa and 
Purdue games, hut says that be can- 



not find that at IPFW. He believes 
that IPFW has become a place only 
for TU and Purdue students to com- 
mute to and wishes that things 
were very different. " We arc 
IPFW, Wc arc not lU. Wc an: not 
Purdue," Ball said. "Wc have an 
excellent educational system. Wc 
do not suppon to the extent that we 
ought to things that we have on 
campus. Nor do we have enough 
things on campus to suppon."

Movie Review: the must-see films of the vear 



K^ra Whtllng 
Features Editor 

The next iwo films will be 
reviewed anJ discus-icd wiltioul 
giving away loo many delails. 
Tlicrc is a raling sysicm of Junior 
MInLs. my favorite movie snack. 
One Junior Mint Is bad: do not 
waslc your money. Two Junior 
Minis are okay, but could have 
be«n belter. Three Junior Minis 
are excellent: Ihc film .should be 
nominated for something. Four 
Junior Mints is truly a must-sec 
film and If noi already nomJnalcd 
for the best picture of Qie year, it 
may be. This week the movies 
being reviewed arc "Little 
Women" and "Legends of the 
Fall." These films are rated by 
stars ranging from one star being 
the worst to four stars being 
cjicellenl. 

LITTLE WOMEN 

When I first read "Litlle 
Women." I was truly in awe 



because of the way ixuisa May 
Alcoii executed the characierlza- 
lion.s of the March sisters. After 
reading the novel, I never would 
have imagined that a movie 
could be made with the same 
heart and soul that made Louisa 
May Alcott a great author. 

"Litlle Women," the movie, is 
an excellent piece of film. This is 
not only because of the sloryline 
created long ago by Louisa May 
Alcotl, but also because of the 
acting, the passion and the direc- 
tion in which Gliian Arm-strong 
took when directing ihe wonder- 
ful siory of four sisters (the 
March sisiers) who grow up with 
each other and Icam to deal with 
the pleasures and the displea- 
sures of life. 

The story revolves mainly 
around Jo, the oldest of the four 
March sisters, Jo is forced to 
work for their aunt when their 
father goes off to be a chaplain in 



the Civil War. The four girls and 
their mother are left to fend for 
themselves and reside in 
Concord, Mass. 

Afier a short while, the girls 
befriend the neighbor boy, 
Laurie. The five children become 
best of friends. Laurie, who was 
usually a quiet, poliie boy, Icams 
lo live life to its fullest with Ihe 
girl's life and spontaneity. 

As time passes, the children 
grow up and go their separate 
ways. Yet. they always seem to 
find their way home, where their 
hcarLs belong. 

1 will not give away the par- 
ticular details of the story line, 
but you should take a box of tis- 
sues because your heart will be 
touched by the passion that the 
story and iLs characters create in 
a film that I believe is one of the 
year's best, sft :(t :|t 

LEGENDS OF THE FALL 

I thought that "Little Women" 



was one of the year's best, but I 
had not yei seen "Legends of the 
Fall." starring Anthony Hopkins 
and Brad Pitt. This film has epic 
proportions and in an overall 
sense was one of the best movies 
I have ever seen. This film is up 
there with "The Star Wars 
Trilogy," "Godfaiher I, 11 and 
ni" and "When Harry Met Sally." 

Words cannot describe Ihe 
feeling one has throughout this 
film. It is a siory about a family 
of men who love the same 
woman and live with the dcslruc- 
lion she causes. 

The lime frame spans across 
many years. It starts with the 
faiher. played by Anthony 
Hopkins, who portrays yet anoth- 
er masterful character, a general 
watching the Indians for the U.S. 
Army. He hates the government 
for the way it exploits and drives 
out Ihe Indians. He befriends an 
old Indian named One Slab who 



narrates the movie from his point 
of view. 

The sons. Alfred, Tristan and 
Samuel, all have a bond of love 
and though things get rough 
sometimes, they manage to still 
find forgiveness and love in their 
hearts. 

Suzanna is the woman who 
tears their hearts apart. She was 
to marry Samuel, the youngest, 
but when he weni off to fight in 
the first World War. he met a 
tragic ending. Alfred and Tristan 
go to fight as well, but not for the 
same reasons as Samuel, They 
go lo keep Samuel safe from 
harm. When ihcy were not suc- 
cessful, Tristan blamed himself, 
and Alfred blamed Tristan as 
well. 

This guilt is seen throughout 
the film and causes many prob- 
lems for Tristan and the family. 

To go on would only ruin the 
story. It is always armoying to 



have someone tell the whole 
story before one sees it, so ! will 
Slop here with the story line. 

If the characters and Ihe story 
itself cannot attract you to sec 
this truly wonderful film, then 
the majestic beauty of the West 
that is portrayed in this film will 
definitely attract you. Edward 
Zwick. the director, really knew 
how 10 capture the perfection of 
our beautiful country in such a 
way that leaves you breathless. 

But do not be deceived by the 
beauty alone, because the pas- 
sion and the fire that this film 
igniies is awesome. And bring 
your box of tissues to tJUs film as 
well as to "Little Women," 
because I can guarantee you will 
need them from beginning to 
end. 

In my estimation, this film Is 
the year's best, and I highly rec- 
ommend viewing it. if you have 
not already. )|c )ft ]|[ 9(( 



Sting, Jade and Sade: A review 



Paul IXippcr 
i Features Writer 

1 am always trying to find music 

that will pui mc in various moods. 

lliis week, I chose lo review three 

;;.ncw albums by three very different 

i-artisis that put mc into three diffcr- 

^-£nt moods. 

K STING " Fleld.s of Gold: The 
I Best of Sting 19S4-1994" 

1 This, the first hits collection of 
, the former Police frontman's solo 
work, is more of a journey than an 
album. Each song is able to lell a 
;- rich story of someone else's life. 
f-Thc most sobering of these stories 
is "Russians," a somewhai out- 
dated but still effeciivc account of 
the Reagan adminisu^tion handling 
of the ihen-communist country. 

Sting can also be a lomaniic 
when he wants to be. This is evi- 
dent in the album's first new single 
"When We Dance," It tells a siory 
of a man in love with a woman who 
may be in love with another man. 
The song is an atiempi lo convince 
the woman they are bclier together 
.^tban she and this other man (When 
•;we dance/ angels will run and 
•lia6e). 

'li"] This album not only put me inio 
&gt; a different mood, it also made me 
:* feel like I became a different pcr- 
!; son while I was listening to it. For 
; this, I rate this collection a nine out 
. ofapossible 10. 

JADE "Mbid. Body, &amp; Song" 
'r_ The firsl album by this talented 
trio was a bonng collection of bub- 
ble gum pop, with the only excep- 
tion being "Don't Walk Away." It's 



good to see that for their second 
outing. Joi, Tonya, and Di have 
matured to a more soulful sound. 

It could be that the girls took 
control of this album by co-writing 
many of the songs. Whatever the 
formula, this album is smarter and 
more enjoyable than the first Not 
since The Pointer Sisiers have there 
been three ladies who so effectively 
blend their voices together. 

Dancing is again made available 
with songs like "5-4-3-2 (Yo! Time 
is up)" and "Every Day of the 
Week." Most of the songs are lust- 
driven. For example, listen to "If 
Ihe Mood is Right" or "Bedroom" 
and you may find yourself wanting 
to bump and grind with your love 
(or [he person standing closest by). 



"Mind, Body, &amp; Song" was able 
to put me in a raunchy mood. Not 
being an easy task for any women 
to do. this album receives an eight 
out of a possible 10. 

SADE "The Best of Sade" 

If you've never owned a Sade 
album, you will never fully appre- 
ciate what this group can do. By 
listening to the released singles 
played on the radio, you might 
describe their music as being calyp- 
so or Caribbean. But the category 
Sade best fits would be the jazz cat- 
egory. 

This career retrospective not 
only contains those singles with 
which we are mosi familiar, bul 
also a few gems that will broaden 
the minds of non-Sade listeners. 



"Jezebel" shows Ihe group's ability 
10 tell a great story, while "Is it a 
Crime" illustrates the vocal ability 
of the group's lead singer. Sade 
Adu. 

It makes sense to pull most 
songs from the group's best album. 
"Love Delux." Five of that album's 
cuts are here, including "No 
Ordinary Love," in my opinion the 
finest track Sade has ever done. 
Also included is the remake of 
"Please Send Me Someone lo 
Love" from the "Philadelphia" 
soundtrack. 

This album was able to put me 
in every mood; I wanted to dance. 1 
wanted to cry, I wanted to fall in 
love... all within a 16-song collec- 
tion. For that, ibis album earns a 



i-soo-i^e-efiS?-

In search of... the best coney dog 



Kan Whiting 
Fealurei Edilnr 

Alrighty Ihen, as Jim Carrey 
would say. ihis week I look a dilTcr- 
cni look ai Tood and decided lo find 
ihc besi hot dog in Fori Wayne. 
Bciiidcft (he all-lime classic and 
favoriic Coney Island, I went way 
out of my way lo find oiher places 
thai serve coney dogs, in ihat fash- 
ion. After careful invcsligaiion, I 
discovered iwo oiber places Uiai 
serve coney dogs and they are 
Coney Enpress and Doggie Dogg 
and More. 

Al each restaurant, I ordered two 
coney dogs wiih everything on 
tbem. Just for a price reference. 
Coney Island happened to be the 
most inexpensive with two coney 
dogs costing only SI. 81. Coney 
Express was nent in line at two for 
51.89, and Doggie Dogg and More 
was ibc most expensive at S2.I0 for 
two coney dogs with everything. 

Now, Ihen, this week's rating 
will be based on bites. One bile is, 
of course, as you may well know 
by now, awful. Two biles arc a little 
bit better than one, but sUII pretty 
pathetic. Three bites arc good, and 
four bites are truly amazing. 

Let Ihc games begin. 
DOGGIE DOGG AND MORE 

Located on Paulding Koad, near 
Bishop Luers High School, this 
coney dog was not bad at all. As 
you know, I ordered it with every- 
thing. Everything included ketchup, 
mustard, huge chunks of onions 
and some secret chili sauce that 
was very tasty. The hot dog itself 
was big and juicy and well-cooked 
as far as hoi dogs go. I really liked 



this coney dog. but the price was a of the hoi dog, it was not very big dog. of course. As expecied, the 



little steep compared to the others. 
So my final rating of the Doggie 
Dogg and More coney dog was 
thrcc-and-a-half bites out of a pos- 
sible four, 

CONEY EXPRESS 



r juicy. Based on these facts alone Coney Island coney dog 

I was able to give this poor excuse remarkable. My first bile I was in 

for a coney dog two bites oui of the heaven and asked myself why I 

possible four. hadn't been there in so long. 

CONEY ISLAND Everything was perfecu right down 

Of course I saved the bcsi for to the lasi bite. If you have not tried

This fine drive -Ihru- only estab- 
lishment is located in Southgate 
Plaza, which is off Calhoun Street 
Personally. I felt this coney dog 
was not up to standards or some- 
thing. I paid S1.89 for two coney 
dogs that bad mustard, onions and 
chili sauce. The bun was soggy and 
so was the hot dog itself. Speaking 



last. Isn't thai the way il should 
always be? Well, most people know 
thai this famous establishment is 
located on Main Street in down- 
town Fort Wayne, ^d, although the 
interior is not exactly up-to-date. 
Ihc atmosphere and the spunk of 
the joint is the real reason to go 
there. Besides the excellent coney 



a Coney Island coney dog, go 
today. Drop everything you have to 
do, and just go; ihen you will 
understand. For the best coney dog 
in town for a price of S 1 ,8 1 for two, 
you cannot go wrong. So without 
hesitation, I graciously give Coney 
Island four-and-a-balf bites out of 
four. (Yes. it is thai gofxi.)

al the Center for the Neurobiology of 
Learning Memory at ihc University of 



California, if one were to listen lo

Kara Whiting 
Features Editor 

Here are some suggestions for 
simple cntertainmcni for people 
who are looking for a good book 
lo read, movie to see, movie to 
rem and/or a CD lo lislcn lo. So 
here goes: 

This week's recommended 
book 10 pick up and read is 
•■Catch -22" by Joseph Heller. 
This novel is a funny, yet sublimi- 
nal story about corporate America 
as seen through the eyes of the 
young men who are fighling a 
war. 

The recommended movie lo 
see in the theater is "Legends of 
the Fall " starring Aidan Quinn, 
Brad Pill and Anthony Hopkins. 
If you have a little over two and- 
a-half hours lo spare, go and see 



this remarkable film, you won't 
regret this. 

The recommended movie lo 
rent for this week is "Like Water 
for Chocolate," which is a 
Mexican love story ihat is truly 
unique and stirs the passions in all 
of us. This is available cither in 
subtitles or dubbed style at your 
comer video store. 

The recommended CD of the 
week is the new compilation CD 
of the Go-(jo's, that early eighties 
punk band that we all remember 
from the good 'ol days of early 
MTV. It is titled "Return to the 
Valley of the Go-Go's," This CD 
consists of 36 songs which lake a 
look at the old lousy punk days 
and also exhibits some of their 
newer woric. I suggest you check 
it out.
