government initiative issued by the Office 
of Management and Budget's Quicksilver 
Task Force to improve, among other things, 
government to citizen electronic potential. 

The agreement was extended for 
four more years in 2005 with the goal of 
having 60 percent of all tax returns filed 



include providing more free online filing 
options, making filing and preparation 
easier, and providing greater access to 
taxpayers. 

The IRS and the government claim that 
private businesses are being used because 
they can "provide taxpayers with higher 
quality services by using the existing 
expertise of the private sector, maximize 
consumer choice, promote competition 
within the marketplace, and meet objectives 
in the least costly manner to taxpayers." 

Private firms had offered tax filing and 
preparation online even before the IRS 
became involved. The difference now after 
the agreement, according to the IRS website, 
is that Free File Alliance companies offer 
both free preparation and e-filing services 
to qualified taxpayers. Before, according 
to the IRS, some companies would charge 
for either the preparation or the filing, or 
both. Under the agreement, both are free 
to eligible citizens. 

To be eligible for the Free File program, 
your adjusted gross income must be 
$50,000 or less. Each participating 
software company sets its own eligibility 
requirements as well.

program or the IRS, go to www.irs.gov.

they pointed out that they do not follow any

Past drug offenders

By Kimberly Huebner 

allowing students with prior drug 
ns to receive financial aid has heen 
passed in Concuss and is awaiting President 
Bush's signature. 

The bill was changed from a resolution passed 
in 2000 that denied access to college financial 
aid opportunities to students with past drug 



The changes Congress is passing will give 
people with a history of drug convictions a 
chance to start over, said Joseph I'eltilion, interim 
assistant provost lor finant ial aid at lexas ASjM. 

"It's basically giving the students an option 
to rehabilitate iheir lives." i'eltilion said. "It's 
no longer penalizing them in the future for 
something lhe\ did in the past." 

Pettibon said the new hill may affect a handful 
of students at A&amp;M. but that he has not seen a 
problem with drug convictions interfering with 
financial aid al ihe University.

Staff Editorial 



Mind the gap 



Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, 
?r prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom 
of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to 

assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances 



As a newspaper The Communicator has 
an obligation to report the whole story. The 
Communicator has decided to print the 12 cartoons 
based on the fact that they are newsworthy and the 
public deserves the entire story behind the world- 
wide violence. 

We have no malicious intent. 

Our intent is to inform the public. 

As journalists— aspiring college students or not — 
it is our duty to inform our readers. By showing 
the cartoons, we believe it will stir conversation on 
campus and in the community. 

Less than a handful of national newspapers have 
printed ope, a few. or all of the 1 2 cartoons that depict 
a satirical viewpoint of the prophet, the Islamic 
religion and even extremist terrorism. 

Their reasoning has ranged from not wanting to 
disrespect the religion to fear of reprisal from angry 
Muslims. 

Leonard Downie lr, executive editor of The 
Washington Post, said, "They wouldn't meet our 
standards for what we publish in the paper. We have 
standards about language, religious sensitivity, racial 
sensitivity and general good taste." 

The Los Angeles Times said in a statement, "Our 
i and opinion page editors, independently 



of each other, determined that the caricatures could 
be deemed offensive to some readers and there 
were effective ways to cover the controversy without 
running the images themselves." 

The First Amendment to the Constitution 
of the United States guarantees us a right to free 
speech. Regardless whether that speech is deemed 
appropriate or offensive, we have a right to say it. 

The Communicator is baffled at the lack of national 
newspapers printing the cartoons and has elected to 

)t simply for the sake of doing it, 
ve the public interest by providing 
in a debate where they have been 
eking. 
in this post-9/11 world in which 
curiosity about the Islamic religion has become 
understandably widespread, for national media not 
to pay closer attention to the crux of the issue? 

For them to run footage of angry Muslims 
protesting in the street, burning flags and holding up 
threatening signs, but not to show the cause of these 
acts? 

Sadly, many citizens — in the United States and 
abroad — are misinformed or under-informed about 
debates within Islam. Stereotypes are rampant, and 



We do this r 
but rather to se 
primary source: 
conspicuously 1; 

How is it OK 



hate crimes have become more common since 9/11. 
The footage of the rioting Muslims only further 
confuse the public about religious ideology because 
the media have not fully reported this issue: they 
have not shown what caused it. 

It should be noted that Jyllands-Posten ran 
these cartoons as a satirical piece about staff writer 
Kare Bluitgen's plight in finding illustrators for his 
children's book about the Prophet Muhammad. 
Illustrators turned him down for fear of Muslim 
reprisal because depicting Muhammad — in any 
manner — is considered idolatrous and sacrilegious, 
according to Islam's holy book, the Quran. 

The Communicator reminds readers we are not 
taking a side on this issue, only that U.S. media 
should take a more comprehensive approach when 
reporting on it. 

These cartoons are being published with the same 
consideration that any controversial image would 
bring about in The Communicator. 

View the drawings of the 12 cartoons and inform 
yourself. 

We hope your interest will be piqued enough to 
come to a conclusion on your own and fill in the gaps 
between what mainstream media presents and what 
the whole story is.

Night Live or stereotypical 
television shows such as 
"Freddie," "Courting Alex" or 
"Emily's Reasons Why Not," 
although it was neat how they 
all had similar slogans before 
airing their season premiers. 

Oh no, I am discussing true 
comedians, most especially 
those I find true to heart; some 
I mentioned briefly last week. 

I mentioned how today's 
comedians are not the crack- 
addicted hobos from the 70s 
and '80s, i.e. Robin Williams, 
but they have a new sense of 
comedy ensuring their success. 

First off, my personal 
: of 
J, is 

Dane Cook. Let us see, where 
should I start? 

I first found out about Dane 
Cook three to four years ago 



Dane Cook." Cook became 



i'\pl(iilr.i, (.■specially 

past year or two. Cook's first CD 

and DVD combo was released 

in 2000, titled "Harmful If

The best part about this 
combination album is that 



My second favorite comedian 
is a man by the name of Stephen 
Lynch. What's that. ..never 
heard of him? 

popular as Dane Cook, but still 
holds a strong fan base for his 
unique talent.

If the statistics and personal 
acclaim are not convincing 
enough for you, then you have 
no idea what you are missing. 

Dane Cook's originality a 



genre of his comedy is called 
comedtc singer/songwriter. 

What I mean is, he sings 
all of his jokes and stories. 
Surprisingly, he has an amazing 
singing voice and plays the 
guitar really well for his songs.

way I did Cook, from his 



Lynch talked and played

He sings about the

and puts his spin on them while 
singing ,ind playing the guitar. 
I lie combination is incredible. 
Lynch has three albums and one

that sense of humor I love: 
straight to the point with an 
individual touch of absurdity.

What you see here i 
2.0 of this particular &lt; 
1.0 consisted entirely of excerpts from 
Attorney General Gonzalez's testimony 
before the senate, with every occurrence of 
the word "Gonzalez" replaced with "Grand 
MoffTarkin." 

As funny as that would have been, 
editing of that transcript in such a way as to 
fit on this page would have heen so severe 
as to lay me open to (perhaps justified) 
accusations of deliberate misquotation. 

Still, for those of you who saw the 
hearing or portions thereof on the news, 
the mental image remains apt. 

Gonzalez treated those particular 
senators, and indeed the entire legislative 
branch, with a smiling contempt which 
was shacking even to one who was already 
extremely cynical regarding our current 



chard Nixon against several of the people 
i the "White House Enemies List." FISA 
ys out the criteria for obtaining a wiretap 
arrant and establishes a secret court to 

The act has been revised several times 
nee its initial passage; in fact, it has been 
vised five times since Sept. 1 1th. 



It would not have broken the continuity 
of the event in any way had Gonzalez 
gone on to say, "I have just received word 
that the Emperor has dissolved the Senate 
permanently. The last remnants of the Old 
Rvpuhln have been swept away.' 

The reality, of course, isn't as 
as all that. But Gonzalez has, 
served as a representative of a 
branch that is completely out of control. 

Let's omit the whole invasion-of-lraq 
thing for today, and focus on more recent 

The subject of the hearing, during which 
Alberto Gonzalez insulted a lot of our 
elected representatives, was the ongoing 
wiretap scandal, in which President Bush 
has admitted to repeatedly ordering the 
NSA to conduct domestic wiretapping 
operations which violate federal law. 

The fact that this activity was (and 
is) illegal is really not open to dispute 
- all federal wiretapping authority stems 
from FISA, the wording of which is 



secrecy raises an interesting question. 
From what we' have been told of the NSA 
program {which is, of course, not much) 
it seems highly likely that the FISA court 
would have issued the necessary warrants 

why didn't they? 

This question was asked, repeatedly, 
by several of the senators present at the 
hearing. 

It was not answered. 

Each time, Gonzalez gave vague 
speeches regarding the president's duty to 
protect Americans or how wonderful FISA 
is in lieu of an actual answer. 

I see two possibilities: either the 
administration thinks the secrecy of the 
FISA court is insufficient, or they think that 
they wouldn't get the warrants. 

The first possibility is contrary to the 
stated position of the administration. 



In a building so crawling with lawyers 
as the White House, the suggestion that 
the illegality nt the program never crossed 
anyone's mind is, frankly, ludicrous. 

I he mil) pussihilin we .ire left with, 
then, is that Bush didn't think the FISA court 
would give him the wiretaps he wanted. 

If the secret wiretap court wouldn't like 
i inclined to 
reason for it. 
so it follows that the more we, the public, 
knew about them the less we'd approve of 
the idea. 

This is just a guess, but given this 
administration's track record I think it 
likely that the wiretaps involved are fairly 
indiscriminate; that is, that they are being 
established with little i&gt;r nothing in the way 
of probable cause. 

Further speculation is idle, though, as 
we do not know, and probably never will, 
the operational details of the program. 

The justification of all of this has been 

We're at war. 

There's a dangerous enemy out there. 
This notion doesn't disturb people 
anywhere near as much as it should. 

Congress has not declared war. We 
aren't engaged with a foreign military.

cannot be other than perpetual.

Ft. Wayne drivers 
dangerous in snow 



Staff Column 



say everyone. I remember how 



don't have to drive 
anywhere. Then I can sit on 
the couch with my mug of hot 
cocoa, relax, and enjoy the 
beautiful snow falling. 

I never minded driving in it 
until the first snow fall of 2005. 
Now I'm not a paranoid selii/.o, 
if you could call me that. Yes, 
the bad roads tend to make 
me a little nervous. But, that's 
not quite it, either. It's also 
the other drivers who make me 

More specifically, the ones 
who aren't careful and drive. 
Why do I care so much? Because 
every time 1 see someone whiz 
by me in their nice, four wheel 
vehicle, I find myself 



Anyone who knows i 
enough ought to know by now 
that 1 love telling stories. 

As I was driving home one 
Saturday from work around 
9:30 at night, 1 realized how 
people forget how to drive in 
the snow. So, snow only comes 
four months out of the year. Big 
deal, right? Wrong. When 1 was 
driving home on Feb. 11, all I 
could do was shake my head 

Then there were at least 
another five who hit the guard 
rails or the middle wall along the 
highway. Do people not realize 
that during bad weather they 
need to slow down? ApparenUy 
not since they think as long 
as they have four wheel drive 
they'll be okay. Wrong again. 

People with four wheel 
drive, if they are not cautious 
during bad weather, are just as 
susceptible to getting into an 
accident as those people who 
don't have four wheel drive. 
It is like people forget how to 



on slick roads. The faster they 
go, the quicker they get to their 
destination right? Well, if they 
don't get into an accident first, 
So, people can't take tlieir time 
when i lie weather sucks. 



destination, it would probably 
be better then ending up either 
in an accident or the hospital. 
Avoiding those two key 
situations could probably save 
a person quite a bit of money. 
But, hey, I'm no expert nor do 1 
claim to be one. 

1 was driving down the 
highway and there were people 
just dying past me, probably 
doing about 50 or CO. Okay, so 
they were driving SUVs, vans 
and trucks. Still. 1 was freaking 

whined past me. 

I kept thinking that someone 
is going to slide into me sooner 
or later. What is the deal with 
people who ride your ass when 
the roads are crappy? What a 



I would give those 
drivers a piece of my 
mind if I could, but I'll 
just bite my tongue 
and deal with it. 



I have to slain on my brakes 
for some reason, they are going 
to be screwed if they can't stop 

It is kind of annoying when 
I'm trying to be careful and 
other people get pissed off 
about it. Well, excuse me for 
wanting to be careful and not 
get into an accident. I really 
think that I don't want to drive 
around a car that is all mangled 
because I decided to drive fast 
on crappy roads. 

If you don't like my driving, 
you better get over it because 
1 really don't care. I would give 
those drivers a piece of my 
mind if 1 could, but I'll just bite 
my tongue and deal with It. 

When I got home after my 
hour venture driving to get 
there, It almost made me wish 
I lived closer to school. But 
only just a tiny hint of that wish 
reached my mind. At least I 
wouldn't have to drive as far to 
get home. Then I wouldn't get 
all worked up and nervous. At 
least the drive home would be 
less stressful for me if I lived 
closer to school and work.

Legal issues loom for 
online gaming providers 



By Jeremy Turnage 



(U-W1RE) COLUMBIA, S.C. 
- Millions of gamers around the 
world are working hard to keep 
the games of the past alive using 
current computing technology. 

The process is called

"a program

computing device, that can 
emulate a video game console 
or handheld, so a computer 
can be used to play games that 
were created for that console

console." 

An emulator simply works by 
having the emulator program

SNES and Genesis emulators 
soon arrived as well. Today, 
this community of dedicated 
gamers has created emulators 
for video game consoles all the

fun of those games. The most 
popular arcade emulator is 
MAME, or Multiple Arcade 
Machine Emulator. MAME 
can currently emulate 1000+

load up the emulator and then 
open the ROM image of "Super 
Mario Bros."The game will work 
jusi like it did when the NES 
was hooked up to the television 
years ago. 

The emulation community 
has been around for a very long

bugs and incompatibilities.

Copyright holders have often

of emulation are quite like the

Book Review 



► BRUISER: Page A7 



"The 4 Realities of Success" is written by 
Bob Roth. The book is about how to become 
a successful person, and it begins talking to 
high-school students, then college students, 
then graduaies. The book has s 



good suggestions c 



&gt; approach life 



start with the positive aspects of the book 
first. It has a lot of important and useful 
ideas about how to prepare for life before, 
during and after college. It also gives good 
ideas for planning out how people should 
spend their time as high school students and 
college students so that what they do then 
will help them land their job. It also talks 
about how participating in college events and 




that the author thinks it is the only n 
you need to become successful, and it seems 
that he stresses the fact that if you do not do 
as he says you will most likely not find a job 
and will not be successful, Unfortunately he 
does not give you his definition of success. 
For instance two people may look at success 
in two different ways. One person sees it as 
being a wealthy tycoon of a growing industry 
while the other person seeks to have a family, 
enjoy life, and find a less time-consuming 
job to support that type of lifestyle. 

The book itself is quite long and so dry 
that one can only read so much at a given 
time — which also makes it hard to retain all 
the information. It may appear depressing 
at times because it focuses on pleasing the 
employer and trying to build your life around 
them, which gives you no life of your own. 
This will definitely burn out a person if they 
are only doing their major or future job to 
make a lot of money. 

The author uses bullet points for nearly 
everything he writes about, which is nice 
since it is easy to read, but the topics he talks 
about are not in-depth enough to be very 
helpful, I have encountered at least two other 
sources that have been more helpful about 
resumes and interviews than this book has 
been about those same topics. 

Another problem with the book is thai 
when he advises students to start saving 
for college, he says they should start when 
they are born. Instead it should start with a 
more realistic age to be more helpful to the 
students. 

Another disadvantage of the book being 
brief about its topics is when it mentions to 
go to your parents for advice about plans for 
preparing to go to college as well to assist 
you when you are in college. While this can 
be true, it unfortunately does not go into 
detail if you do not have parents like that. 
For instance, they could be very busy and 
you might hardly see your parents or the 
parents could be abusive and withhold that 
money from you, or if the students are not 
comfortable being around their parents in

we expect things to turnaround?

TYip: Think of it: if a pitcher tears an ACL 
or seperates her shoulder or even falls down

down to a single pitcher to carry us through the 
season. I think the outfielders should practice 
i heir pitching while waiting to make plays. 

Skip: They should do something, get some 
walk-ons or something. This is irresponsible 
coaching at its best. I mean, the girls went 14-35 
last year Whv not replace him? 

TYlp: Good question, my witty banter partner 
Word is he HAS been bringing in walk cms Bui 
the\ don't pitch, further deepening a bench that 
doesn't need bats and fielders. Inn pitchers. We 
have some talent on ihe squad; it needs to be 
utiliized to its full potential. 

Skip: Unless we have some shout outs, were 
not going to win a whole lot. I've pitched before 
and your arm gels tired I cm only imagine whai 
the two young ladies are going logo through. 

Trip: They will ' 



coach Chris Paul and our hackcourt of Ashley 
Johnson and Johnna I-ewis-Carlisle. 

TYlp: Yeah, good |ob girls Bui 1-20 is Still 2-20. 
Bui I hey aren't gning up. dial's ,;ood to see. 

Skip: I agree, but we are very undersized as 
well. We've been i lose but can't get over that 
hump just yet time will tell iT Paul will get (lie 
job, but I think our next topic ol discussion will 
..house (bat, won't be Mr. Trip? 

Trip: Oh most likely. Skippy. And you have- 
some beef with the bead honi bo, don't you? 

Skip: Yeah. I do. And on a personal note, I 
think we can do better. Athletic Director Mark 
Pope is a hell of a nice guy, but really what 
aieoiiiplishincnls has he given us at IPFW so 



i soitb.dl held is slightly 



far with IPFW. 

Trip: So who finishes with nunc wins, baseball 
or softball? 

Skip: Hands down, baseball, look for them 
logo for the school record in wins ibis year And 



Trip: Well, nolthe big oi 

affiliation hill 1 like lo think we have made some 
strides Home games at Memorial Coliseum, the 
Soccer Showtase growing Do you 1 1 link we could 
get someone better? 

Skip: I think we • ould get someone with mure 
sporis experience Soccer Showcase is definiteh 
huge, but J think a lot ol that credit goes to Coach 
Siefankiewic/ I lie ( ulisetim is okay, but if there 
wasn't beer would yon go to any games there? 

Trip: I'd like to think so, but who knows. I 
guess we will agtee to disagree on this topic, 
Skippy, I'm a tan ol the Mr. I'ope. He is a sweet 
dresser and should do some marathons. Thai guy 
runs for hours at a lime. So didn't we have some 
huge news to drop on everyone this week? 

Skip: I 

ol' Gates Center, 

Trip: Oooooo. I'm sold. So everyone should 
slay luned to further episodes of Wilty Banter, 

Skip: Well yes tor that, and I swear we will get 
belter as time goes on. Like alter this week when 
we have some home games. And the huge rivalry 
in men's vollev ball we talked wrongly about a few 
weeks ago. 

Trip: Yes, you did. That conies up this Friday, 
so ail you IPFW Ireelo.idersget some school spirit 
and come out and root on the men's volleyball 
learn spank some Ball Stale keysier. 

Skip: hxaclly, so come out, drink a Keystone or 
six. root on IPFW athletics, not for the marketing 
department but to have Inn and take advantage 
ol ihe i rappv campus life Herneiiiher this slogan: 
alcohol makes anything better. 

Trip: I'll drink to that Skip. Well, we have 
reached the end of another fabulous journey. 
Any parting words for our adoring fans? 

Skip: Remember the legacv nl Richard Nixon, 
Diik Baxter and John Wilkes Booth, all great
