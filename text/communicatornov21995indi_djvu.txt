you will find your total fees

The new fee consolidation 
was presented to IPSGA Monday 
by Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Frank Borelli. "We found 
a way to consolidate fees as 
many people have ret|uested." 
said Dorelli to the Student

Myth that 
terrorism could 
never reach 
American soil 
destroyed 



l.y KtI.eccu Kwni 
Chkf keporttr 



In the wake of the Amtruk derailment 
in Arizona, questions have been raised 
about Ihe ability of IPFW and Fort 
Wayne to deal with Ihe threat of terror- 



Earlier this year. Keitler Hall dealt 
with ii.s own bomb threat, IPFW has a 
history of such threats. In 1993 the cam- 
pus received at least five bomb threats. 

According to Lauren Denhartog. 
chiefof campus police, IPFW is security 
conscious. About three officers are 
always patrolling the campus. Each situ- 
ation is handled in a unique way. With 
an average of 23 years of experience, 
officers claim CO know how to spot peo- 
ple who do not belong. While IPFW 
does have good security, ihc officers 
cannot do everything, 

"1 think the biggest deieneni from 
every day problems is we have a lot of 
experienced officers," said Denhartog, 
"Routine patrol with experienced offi- 
cers is the key." 

AILhough experience is vital to deter- 



ring crime, no place is complciely free 
from the direat of terrorism 

"People can get their hands on what- 
ever they want if they try hard enough, 
like the bombing in Oklahoma City. ' 
said student Bill Lanier 

Before the World Trade Center 
bombing, many believed terrorism could 
not touch American soil, Bui when the 
explosion heard across New York City 
made the news. Americans began to 
think twice 

"The American public should always 
be vigilant, bul this suspected act of ter- 
rorism should not be viewed a.s the open- 
ing act in a coming wave of tcnorism." 
said former FBI Director William 
Sessions after the World Trade Center 
bombing. 

Less than a year after Session's state- 
ment, the citizens of Oklahoma City felt 



the shock waves ofanolher bomb which 
lore through the Alfred P. Murrah 
Building, What even horrified the public 
more were the children who died while 
playing in the building's day care This 
time the deaths could noi be blamed on 
foreign murderers, but instead 
Americans had to look at home to find 
the killers. 

And when the country finally fell the 
terror had ended, a train derailed killing 
three people Many thought it was a 
technical malfunction, but much to most 
Americans' dismay the suspected cul- 
prits were terrorists — fellow 
Americans. Terrorism had struck 
American soil once again. 

The University Police request stu- 
dent's assistance in dealing with the 
potential problem. Any questions should 
be referred to the police at 48 1-6827.

How much longer do we 
have to wait until left lane 
into Kettler is open? 



Now Uiai I-4Ci'' has been opened 
we Ta'l il is iiinc lo reopen the lefl 
turn from (he Coliseum entrance lo 
Ihc campus The parking spaces 
ncxi to Kcillcr arc easier to accciis 
by (his entrance. It is a major pain 
in the ass to come in from ihe 
Crescent Avenue entrance and ride 
Ihc mn/e to ihe other side o! 
school. Why have a door thai you 
cannot walk through? 

There was a lime when not 
aJlowing the leli turn made a bit of 
sense. Traffic at the busiest times 
was slowed by those making the 
left hand turn This could have 
been solved easily by paving over 
the bridge and adding to the turn 
lane, but that caused controversy. 
Many didn't want this "historical" 
bridge (Docs this piece of history 
have a name and who knows it?) to 
be touched. They got their wish, 
forcing the IPFW drivers to travel 
far out of their way lo get lo the 
parking spots closest to the appro- 
priate exit. 



This traffic (low has now been 
decreased with the completion of I- 
469. which takes travelers around 
Fort Wayne rudier dian through it 
via Coliseum Doulevard and 1-6') 
With less irairic to hold up. it is nol 
necessary to continue to limit the 
entrance into IPFW. It is now very 
possible to do this without hurtmg 
the precious and tasteless work of 
art ofa bridge. 

What is it about this bridge that 
makes ii historical? It certainty 
doesn't look like something that 
deserves to stand in the way of stu- 
dents entering this campus. Maybe 
Shelley Long lost her virginity 
under it, therefore we mustn't tam- 
per with it Or could it be that 
Johnny Applesccd himself once 
graced the bridge in order to plant 
an apple iice? Whatever the reason, 
since most of us do not know Ihe 
historical value of this bridge, let's 
use il to the student's advantage. 

Or would thai be too 
much trouble?

Native Americans have 
diversity within the race 



by F&lt;ilii:iii lieethinn 
r.uest Columnist 

November is national Native 
American Month, Have you ever 
considered Native American diver- 
sity? Do you think of us as the 
antagonists in the old Hollywood 
cowboys and Indians shoot 'em 
ups? (We rode horses, waved guns, 
and whooped ii up.) Do you tlimk 
of us as wooden, unemotional &amp;nd 
drunken ..Indians ouiMde .ihc 
saloons? (The only word they knew 
was "Ugh'" and they were drunk in 
the gutter 24 hours per day.) Do 
you think of Native-American 
women as exotic princesses with 
long black hair and European fea- 
lures or. worse yei. as sensuous car- 
loon characters seducing white 
men? (I will save my comments 



about us, as women, for later ) 

All of these stereotypes are inac- 
curate of Native Americans and 
have been perpetrated by the 
Hollywood media. Native America, 
which occupies a whole continent, 
contains as much diversity as 
Europe possesses on its continent. 
Tor example. Swedes and Italians 
are both European, yet no one with 
any sense would argue that either 
group "docsii'l look European." In 
reality Native Americans. Show as 
much diversity too. We occupy the 
continents of America and possess a 
beautiful variety from Canada and 
Alaska to Nova Scoiia and Quebec; 
from California and Mc;iico to 
Florida and the Appalachians, and 
below 10 South America. May I 
suggest that the next lime you arc in 
a bookstore tike Little Professor. 



which tarries a lot of Native 
American books and magazines. 
browse Uirough the pages of a pic- 
lure book and sec how we "really" 
look as Native Americans? Then 
the next lime you meet one of us. 
and we don't Ht Ihe stereotypical 
Hollywood Indian (which was a 
white man or woman with makeup 
and black wigs 99 9^ of the lime), 
respect us. and don't commenl that 
"you'don't look like an Indian to 
me."' No, we don't look and act like 
Hollywood Indians; wc aren't all 
Indian princesses (the concept of 
kings and princesses is of European 
origin, not Naiivc American, any- 
way), but we. as Native Americans 
in North America, are a proud race 
of many diverse nations spanning 
this conlinenl. 



Are you raising a gay child? 



by Paul Tupper 
Cay-ly Forward 

Tracy is seventeen years old- 
hurt, tired and hungry. She lives in 
a cardboard box under a bridge. 
The police chase her away once a 
week. It's only a formality realty; 
they know she'll come back, and 
she knows they'll chase her away 
again. She cats from the garbage 
bins of three restaurants. 
Sometimes a kind kitchen worker 
will box things up in take-out con- 
tainers and set ihem under the stairs 
behind the restaurant. Her story b a 
sad, yet familiar one. 

Tracy's dad works for the city in 
road reconstruction. Her mother 
works part-lime at a grocery store 
as a checkout clerk. Doth are heavy 
drinkers. When Tracy was at home, 
money wasn't plentiful, but food 
was always on the table, the family 
always ate dinner together and the 
kids (three) were always clothed, 
Tracy's life was clearly better than 
most. 

She is the oldest child, and in her 
eyes, always to blame for every- 



thing that happens at home. Having 
a homely look about her, she has 
never had a real boyfriend, but she 
did have a few quality girlfriends. 
They were the kind of friends that 
understood her and her situation, 
especially Barb, One rarely saw 
Tracy without Barb. Everyone 
thought il was because neither 
could find a boyfriend, so they 
found each odier. Six monihs ago 
Tracy's parents learned how true 
ihai was. 

On one of the weekly sleep- 
overs, Barb began to touch Tracy in 
a way that she had never been 
touched by another person, Tracy 
had never had sexual thoughts 
about another woman before but 
wanted desperately to be loved She 
knew Barb loved her and accepted 
these advances. 

Jusi then. Tracy's dad walked 
into the bedroom. 

Whal happened next occurs only 
in the worst prison movies. Tracy's 
dad slammed Barb against a wall, 
knocking her oui cold. He then pro- 
ceeded to punch Tracy closed fisted 
in the face. He hit her with such 



vigor that not only did he break 
three of her teeth and jaw, but he 
broke his own hand as well. This 
did not stop him. He kept hilling on 
her until she did not react lo his 
blows. He then raped her, a desper- 
ate attempt to change her sexuality. 

Tracy's mom called the police 
When ihcy arrived, an ambulance 
was called. As Tracy's dad was 
being detained, she fled vowing 
never to return. She has kept her 
promise. 

When Barb's parents found out, 
they packed up and moved to 
another state where they sent her to 
a psychiatrist, hoping lo de-gay 
their daughter, 

Tracy could very well be your 
child There are a tot of parents on 
this campus, represented in every 
category of academia. I challenge 
all parents to look at your children 
in the eyes, no matter what age. and 
ask yourself, "What if my child is 
gay'*" Think about this long before 
that day arrives. Il could happen 
And if il does, you should be better 
prepared to answer that question 
than Tracy's dad.

Campus mourns loss 
of active student 



De.ir Editor: 

On October 5 of this year an 
IPPiV student by the name of James 
Stipe was murdered along with one 
of his friends at an ATM machine 
on the south side of Ft. Wayne. 
James was an older, returning stu- 
dent, studying interior design and 
architeciural engineering technolo- 
gy. He belonged to the American 
Institute of Architeciurc Students 
(AlAS), and had a deep interest in 
the world of architecture. I met Jim 
for the first time at an AIAS meet- 
ing but didn't get to really talk to 
him until later during a field trip to 
Chicago. The next day he was 
dead. Even though 1 barely knew 
him. I can honestly lell you that he 
had a kind and outgoing personali- 
ty It was clear that he had'a love 
of life and was very excited to be at 



IPFW and about the things that he 
was learning. 

It is the misfortune of this entire 
school that we all never got [lo 

"Each one of us 
is important no 

matter 

how insignificant 

we may seem" 

know] James Stipe before he left 
us However, there is one impor- 
tant lesson dial he taught me. Each 
one of us is important no matter 
how insignificant we may seem. In 
a world that changes overnight, and 
in a society that seems to be losing 



its grip on moral values, it is easy to 
forget that each life is sacred. 1 
hope that Jim's death will remind 
us that we have someUiing tmpor- 
tani 10 give to each other: friend- 
ship. And thai the friendships we 
make will lead lo lasting positive 
memories of our lime together at 
IPFW. pur hves seem quite hectic, 
and somelfm'cs we feel we can't 
slow down lo appreciate oihcK 
Let us remember to be thankful for 
the people who touch our lives and 
to reach out to diose around us. 

May you rest forever in God's 
eternal love James Stipe,

Students rally behind iyistructor 



Chancellor Waned. 

I have been a student at IPFW 
since the fall of 1986, and over the 
years I have noticed a senous lack 
of minority professors. Then in the 
spring of 1993 1 signed up for a 
civil liberty/civil rights course 
taught by RJieba Knox. I had never 
had her as a professor, but a fellow 
student highly recommended her 
Ms. Knox was great Since then 1 
have enrolled in two additional 
courses taught by Ms Knox, even 
though I am a history major and her 
courses were in Political Science. 
Her vast knowledge constantly 
amazes me. Her skill at presenting 
course information in an organized 
and interesting manner is incredi- 
ble. This was a positive experience 
for me. What concerns me is the 



fact diat many students at IPTAV are 
completing their degrees without 
having ever been exposed to pro- 
fessors of diverse ethnic back- 
grounds. 

This fall I attended Ihe major 
presentation by Herman Blake I 
was encouraged to see that you 
attended part of the events and fell 
diat you were committed to an eth- 
nically diverse faculty. Yet if you 
are truly committed lo this, then 
why aren't you taking steps to hang 
onto one of the best professors at 
this campus? As a student, and as 
you have emphasized a consumer 
of IPFW's services. I want to see 
Rheba Knox hired into a full-time, 
permanent position. Mr. Cox's 
statement in The Communicator 
dial there is only one full-lime pro- 
fessor of African descent attests to 



the problem on this campus of a 
lack of minority representation in 
die faculty RJieba is already teach- 
ing at IPFW Every student and/or 
professor I have talked to or heard 
speak about her agrees that she is 
more than qualified. Hiring Rheba 
in a full-time capacity would be a 
significant step toward creating an 
ethnically diverse faculty for cur- 
rent and fuiure students. 1 respect- 
fully ask that you look into this 
matter again, and I thank you in 
advance for your consideration of 
my request.

Pebbles "Slraighl From My 
Heari" 

Just the ihoughi or a new 
Pebbles album excites me. Her first 
two albums had a sexy kitten, come 
hiihcr quality about ihem that 
makes her irrcsislibte. She has tx;en 
able 10 get the groove on with more 
than one of her hit singles. So 
imagine my disappoinimcni when 1 
listened to her laiesl effon."Siraighl 
From My Heart," and found il to be 
a big bore. 

Maybe it's a sign of maiurily 
when an artist slows down the 
tempo, but it doesn't work for a 
singer with such a liltlc voice. 
Pebbs has been able to use her 
weak voice to her advantage on 
over-produced cuts like "Giving 
You the Deneru" and "Backyard," 
While she has resorted lo less pro- 
duction, she has also shied away 
from those great dance tunes, with 
the exception of her first single, ihe 
forgettable "Are You Ready," 

Pebbles has aliempied lo add a 
jazz fiavor lo her music, which is 
not a bad idea, except she misses 
the mark and ends up serving us a 
soulless mix. This transition may 
have worked for her if she were lo 
produce her music faster. She has 
fallen into ihc schedule of releasing 
an album once every five yeais. She 
should have watched whai hap- 
pened to Cyndi Lauper when she 
used this taciic. If Pebbles wanted

(TAFKA) Prince "The Cold 

Kxperitince" 

Can you imagine Mariah C'.u-ey 
singing "P Control?" 
This is 

Prince at his 
nasiiesi — 
and yes P 
stands for ihc 
word thai 
rhymes wiih 
wussy — and 
no one can 
come close. As 
I listen to diis. 
I wonder if 
what Prince is 
singing about is 
available in a 

can. In any case, this album is his 
best since "Diamotids and Pearls." 

Included is a version of "Shhh" 
thai Prince wrote for Tcvin 
Cambell. After hearing Prince's 
version, Cambell can never show 



Now Hiring 




his face in daylight again. Prince 
breaks the four-minulc- song -rule 
and takes over seven minutes to get 
his poini across. Sometimes 
patience works the best. 

Last summer's big hit "The 
Most Beautiful Girl In. 
fhe World" is hen: loo in 
an improved form. 
Although the song has a 
new ending, the driving- 
a-convcniblc-in-ihe- 
spring feel is siill iheiv. 
Trying lo repeat 
Ihe same success, but 
not accomplishing, is 
"I Hate You." 
Remember when 
Michael Bolton came 
out with "Said I 
Loved You... Bui 1 
Lied," only lo see thai it was a 
mushy love song. Same with this 
one. Why have these great titles and 
not mean ii? 

Thai aside, with work like ihis. 
Prince will one day be ivgardcd as a 
laiier-day Jimi Hcndrix.

Dining Out: 

r/ie perfect evening requires choosing the right restaurant 




hy Andrew Yodtr 
SlafT Writer 

Have you ever been on an 
emrcmcly bad dale? You know. Uic 
kinJ where boih ot you 
jump up 10 answer the 
pay phone ai 
rcsiauram? Or 
maybe ihc 
resiauriinl wa.s 
so lerrible you 
wish arson 
was legal. I 
have hilJ more 
ihan one such 
disas trous 
experience and 
always won- 
dered why 
Ihere was nol a 
guide lo a 
reslaurani (hac 
would nol 
leave a had lasic in my mouth. Sn 
to remedy Uie siluation, I have com- 
piled a list of five resiauranis thai 
are almost guaranteed not lo spoil 
anything more than a mediocre 
dale. 

If you arc in the mood for good 
barhecue and great sports, 
DAMON'S Restaurant is the place 
for you. Big games arc usually 
playing on one or all of Damon's 
five wall-mounicd. big-screen tele- 
visions, and each table has individ- 
ual speakers so you can listen to t)ie 
game of your choice. The dinners, 
made up of different combinations 
of barbecue ribs and chicken, have 
an average price of S12 lo S13. Best 
of all is ihe Trivia Game, in which 
you can compete against other din- 
ers in an electronic gainc of trivia 
This game is excellent entertain- 
ment 10 avoid those "ho-hum" 
dates. 

Or. try THE OUTBACK 
However, if you go expeciing to be 
served aUthcntic Australian food, 
you may be Id down. I went in 



Outback with a friend from 
Melbourne, who had never heard of 
many of the dishes listed on the 
menu. ITie food, consisting mostly 
of Volvo-sized steaks, has great fla- 
vor and comes in large enough por- 
tions to silence Rush Limbnugh 
There are also various 
delicious seafood 
and pasta dishes 
priced between 
S12.&lt;J5 and 

SI7.95. Outback 
has a decent beer 
list, including 
"Old Australian 
cr." an 

u s t r a 1 i a n 
favorite ! 

While nol as 
classy as those 
previously men- 
1 1 o n e d . 
M U N C H I E 
EMPORIUM m.ikes up for it by 
being a truly fun place to eat. On 
Fridays and Saturdays, there arc 
generally local bands playing until 
late in the evening, providing great 
music and cnterlainment. Also 
Uieie is no cover charge, easing the 
burden for those of us widi luniied 
financial prowess, and 
most dinners \ 
priced between S4 
and $10 Most 
importantly . 
"Munchie's" has 
a beautiful beer list, 
with several imported and 
domestic beers on t^ip 




Sharing space wuh thi 
Great Wall on Coliseum. 
KYOTO JAPANESE 
STEAK HOUSE is a 

great place to go for 
Japanese food. The meals 
are served with soup ar 
rice and come in a variei; 
of coraunon Japanese di^h 
es including seafood 
pork, and beef. With m\ 
average price ot %*) .\ 
dinner, Kyoto will not 
render permanent dam- 
age to most pockeibooks The food 
is cooked inches from your plate by 
out-of-work comedians (not really! 
who crack jokes and egg yolks wuh 
varying ability. Kyoto is fun 
because you are seated at a table for 
eight next to strangers and arc com- 
pelled to have conversations with 
these new neighbors, for beiler or 
worse For great Japanese food, a 
great show and six new friends (or 
enemies) Kyoto is an excellent 
choice. (College students: average 
meal cost is S9— you will be able to 
sufficiently gorge yourself and have 
enough surplus money for books). 

Accurately hailed as Fort 
Wayne's finest restaurant. CAFE 
JOHNELL, located on 
South Clinton is home 
to a dining experience 
one cannot soon for- 
get. The audienlic iui- 
work on the walls 
and die high-backed velvet 

booths provide a perfect com- 



plement 10 the imported food and 
wine. Cost is nol nearly as prohibi- 
tive as believed to be 
either, for though 
one can spend up to 
S60 on a single 
eniree. a great four- 
course meal can be 
had foramerc S18. 
Most appealing are the 
scners, who are friendly, per- 
sonable and have almost limit- 
less knowledge of the food and 
IS ingredients Whether you are 




taking ttiat special someone out tor encc great dining. Cafe Johnell is 
Ihe first lime or just want expcri- the place to go.

What more can we say aboui 
Sanders and bis love for the media 
Is there .mother athlete who craves 
aticniion and crows about his own 
glory to die extent of Mr. Sanders? 
I doubt it. (Gram il. Sanders is 
probably the premier defensive 
back in the National Football 
League, but S35 million? Docs he 
really deserve that kind of cash i 
After returning a punt f^r a touch- 
down in his Tirsi game in the league 
and returning an interception for .i 
louchdown last season in his first 
game for the 49ers, Sanders failed 
to make any highlights in his com- 
ing oui party with the Cowboys. A 
whiff on a tackle, a dropped pass 
and a tipped ball in the end zone 
were bis crowning achievemenLs. 

Oh, what would have happened 
to Ihe Montreal Canadians had 
Quebec seceded from Canada? The 
proudest team in all of professional 
hockey would have had to change 
ils name. How does the Montreal 
Frenchmen sound? Or maybe the 
Frenchies? I have it. die Montreal 
Ticklers! Thankfully, cooler heads 
prevailed and for now Quebec 
remains a part of Canada. The 
Montreal hockey learn can still be 
called die Canadians. The chance 
remains for a Quehccian succession 
however, and then we will have to 
endure the foolishness of the 
"Ticklers", or whatever they might 
be dubbed.

greatly. Her whole family is very 
nihleiic .inJ the linengc nl h.isketh.Tll 



supenoriiy grows with each child. 
Her younger brother, currently a 
senior at DeKalb High School, has 
already verbally commuted to play 
for Bobby Knighi at Indiana 
University. 

"I diink it comes naturally. I am 
used to a leadership role and as ihe 
point guard and team co-capiain ihai 
role is imporiant," said Recker. 

This year's women's basketball 
team is loaded with talent and 
Recker believes the goals, both indi- 
vidual and team oriented, will lead 
10 a very successful season diis year. 

'"This year we have a great team 



with a lot of ability. My job is to 
make everyone on the team look 
good through my play." said Recker. 

Recker added ihat her undying 
love for the sport allows her the free- 
dom to enjoy the game, as well as 
set her sights on lofiy individual 
goals. After selling single-game and 
single-season records for assists, 
Recker aims to sei the all-time 
assists record before graduating from 
IPI^. 

"■Riat is why 1 am oul here every- 
day. Practice may not always be fun 
but I think die love for the game is 
necessary to achieve certain goals."
