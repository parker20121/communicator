I IPFW's greatest import has 
learned how to split her time 
among many responsibilities 

By Kelly McLendon 

St*lt Writer 



Tina Moen knows firsi hand how 
dimcult il Is 10 play for (lie 
haskcrball Icam and still find time to 
manage class assignmcnls. 

"ItlsveryhartllobcafulltimGsludciil 
iiiid a Tull time athlete. Wc travel a lot 
during the season, so missed classes 
are the biggest problem. I think over 
ibc years you learn hnw lo use the 
lime you have efflclcntly to balance it 
easier." the six-foal lall Moen says, 

Moen, however, Is a seasoned pro at 
the basketball part. The senjor played 
with the Norwegian Senior National 
Team and was chosen as a member 
of the All-Star Team for the Elite 
Division In 2004-05. Only five players 
are picked for this honor ihmiighout 
Nonvuy. 

About being chosen for the All-Star 
Team, Moen said. "I couldn't believe it 
at first. Il was only my second season 
In llie top league In Norway and il was 
a great honor considering 1 played 
with and against many great players." 

The knowledge she has gained from 
being involved In different teams and 
leit^ucs has [uughl Moen much about 
the sport. 

"Playing with ihe best players in the 
country and against good European 
learns has given me valuable 
experience that has made me a better 
player." 

During her freshman year in 2005, 
Moen played both for IPFW and her 
Nonvegian leam, splitting one and 
two week periods in each country 
during pans of the fall. 

"Whenever someone has the 
opportunltytoplayforanatonallcani, 
I don't know how you can deny them 
that opportunity." said IPFW head 
coach Chris Paul of Moen's double- 
duty. 

Before her trip to America even 
began, Moen attended Wang 
Toppidrett. a sports academy in her 
native Oslo, Nonvay. 

As a freshman, she played in every 
game while averaging jusi under six 
points. She missed her first game as 
a sophomore and just two as a junior, 
playing in 28 games her junior year.

STRONG: Moen takes the ball up 
for a shot during her sophomore 
season. During that year, Moen 
broke into the All-Time Division I 
record book in six categories. 

While going lo college and playing 
basketball in the U.S. has been a great 
experience for Moen. "The hardest 
pan is being away from my family 
and friends back in Nonvay. The 
leammaies and friends I have here 
are tike family to me (now)," Moen 
noted. 

As a sophomore, Moen was named 
lo the Independent All-Academic 
Team, proving she is cenainly capable 
of keeping good grades and standing 
out as a great player for her team. She 
is also on IPFW's Ail-Time Division I 
records lisl in points, field goals, field 
goal percentage, free throws, steals 
and blocked shots. She sits seventh 
all-time in points with 430 going into 
her senior season. She is also seventh 
in made field goals and founh in 
blocks. 

"Tina each year has gotten better 
and belter. Inicmational basketball 
in a little more finesse whereas in the 
U.S.. it is more physical," Paul said. 
"Everyday I see a confident Tina." 

Always moving forward. Moen 
has set big goals for this basketball 
season. 

"The goal for this season is to win 
the conference championship and get 
to the (NCAA) tournament. For me 
personally as a senior, this is the most 
imponani year and 1 want to make it 
the best season I have ever had." 






I Dane Fife's first recruit found 
out quickly just how things 
can change on the D1 level 

By Dan Vance 

Sponi Editor 



Picture it as if it were a feature film; 
a cast is in place when a new director 
is hired, that new director brings in 
one actor to complete Ihe puzzle and 
before the word action' is bluned out. 
most of the cast is gone and this is a 
completely different movie. 

Sounds tough, right? 

Those are Ihe opening weeks and 
months of lakari lohnson's IPFW 
oddessey. Three full seasons and 
many teammates later, the first 
recruit of coach Dane Fife is slill 
standing and taking center stage even 
for a Mastodon Icam on the brink of 
doing something special. 

He came to IPFW after averaging 22 
points, six assists and four steals as a 
senior at Ottawa Hills High School. 
He culminated his career wiih a big 
buzzer beating three-pointer to send 
a Regional game lo overtime. Ottawa 
Hills lost Ihat game even coming off 
their third straight City League tide. 

When former associate head coach 
JeffTungatefirstjoinedFife'snewslaff. 
lohnson was one of his first mentions 
when discussing player prospects. 

"He (coach Fife) was a young coach 
and J was young too, so I knew he 
could relate with me. He would know 
how I played," lohnson said of what 
stood out at IPFW over other schools. 

When lohnson signed with IPFW 
on April 22, 2005, he was joining 
a team that returned all but one 
player. However within two months, 
seven more players, who made up 
57 percent of the scoring during the 
previous season, were just a memory, 
and lohnson was joining a team that 
relumed jusi 1 2.5 points per game. 

"I kind of figured il was going to 
be a fresh stan for everybody with 
having a new coach." Johnson said. 
"I ibink it was a good thing because 
the team ihat was here was kind of 
satisfied so coach wanted to refresh 
the atmosphere around here," 

As a freshman, the Michigan native 
played in all but 10 games, though 
never starting. Johnson led the team 
in scoring in a loss to Toledo ivith 
12 points but never saw his minutes

move up much, Johnson was eighth 
on the team that first season with just 
six minutes per game. 

Since his freshman season, Johnson 
has played in 58 of 59 games and has 
scored 3B3 of his 428 points. 

"Jakari is Jakari. He's kind of been 
the same way all four years," Fife 
noted. "He's just a very solid guy, 
he's a good person and he Is going to 
give you everything he has in practice 
and hopefully he will do the same in 
games." 

When his college career ends come 
March, Johnson will be just the 
seventh player since 2000 to begin 
his career at IPFW as a true freshman 
and be a member of the team for all 
four years. Since Johnson has entered 
IPI^, 20 other players have come and 
gone from the program viagraduation, 
among other instances. It's a rare 
accomplishment recently for an IPFW 
men's basketball player and one that 
Fife doesn't look at loo lighUy. 

"1 think it is invaluable to have guys 
likejakari Johnson." Fife said. "If I had 
a son, I'd want him lo be like Jakari, 
jusi a wonderful human being. And 
I think that's more imponant than 
anything \vith the type of student 
athletes we recruit." 

"I've always been the guy that once 
I Stan something. 1 like to finish it," 
lohnson added. 

"ItwenlbysofasE,butilhasdefinitely 
been a positive experience for me."

Indiana fails on Trojan's sexual health report card 




By Abigail Kopen 



Ever since junior 
high, ihe fear 
of showing par- 
ents their report cards 
has been haunting leens. 
Many thought thai this 
fear would subside once 
ihey began college, but 
no... unfortunately this 
fear is still very real. The 
good news is, depending 
on which school one at- 
tends, college kids now 
have a report card that 
they can be proud to 
show tlieir parents. Wlio 
does the grading? Of 
course it could be none 
other than the people 
behind IVojan condoms. 
Studies show that the 
more educated we are 
about sex, the less likely 
we are to contract sexu- 
ally transmitted diseases 
or have unplanned preg- 
nancies. Every year TYo- 
jan brand condoms puts 
out a sexual healtli report 
card that ranks colleges 
and universities from 



every state. Schools are 
graded by renewing the 
availability of sexual 
health resources. Also, 
students grade their 
school's effort in edu- 
cating on sexual health 
and on how healthy 
they feel their school is. 
The state of Indiana 
didn't do so hoi. Indiana 
University was ranked 
number 22, a step up 
from last year's rankings 
at number 47, but Pur- 
due University ranked 
lower than Ball State, 
going from number five 

to number 54. The cath- 
olic University of Notre 
Dame ranked in the top 
ten lowest grades going 
from number 109 lo 136 
this year. 

I-low is it that schools 
can even be graded 
on their sexual health? 
Many would think that 
it would be up lo each 
individual student. Ul- 
timately it is, but there 
are certain efforts that 
should be made by our 
universities to help. 



Bert Sperling, presi- 
dent of "Sperling's Best 
Places" said "A school 
can be doing a greai job 
making resources 
and information 
available lo dieir 
student body, but 
if Ihe student's 
themselves don't 
know about them 
or aren't taking 
advantage of them. 
thai impacts the 
overall sexual health 
of a campus- and ulti- 
mately our country." 

II would seem that 
the people behind Trojan 
condoms really have our 
best interest at heart, but 
do they? Is this report card 
actually promoting sex in 
young college students or 
just safe sex for those who 
already have it? Granted, 
Trojan condoms do prob- 
ably use this report card 
as a means of advertising 
and it seems to be work- 
ing well though one does 
not have to use a lYojan.

has become a nationally 
known speaker ljy telling 
her own story. She made 
it dear that anyone can 
fall victim lo violence. In 
1981. she earned her tide 
as a police officer, a rare 
occupation for women at 
that time. "I spent a lot of 
time reporting lo domes- 
tic violence cases and 
wimessing these cases

that I, a police officer, be-

In the preface, the 
author, a retired teacher 
of Gcniian, intercullural 
consulting, and English 
as a Second Language, 
writes that her story is not 
about Germany at war — 
miher it is about how she 
and her faniiiy coped \vith

that befell ihem. Gehlert

the photographs she had, 
and made several trips to 
Germany to interview her 
older brother and sister

and suL'cessIully cutting 
olf the city's lifeline to Ihc 
world and ships loaded 
vvitli liiod. 

In sharing the siory 
of her girlhood, Gehlert 
recounts an especially 
poignant experience of 
herself as a two-year old. 
Hearing the sound of the 
siren, she immediately 
walked out of her home, 
all by herself, to a bomb 
shelter with her small 
suitcase of belongings.

in the beginning, "it is

rich with personal period 
photographs, a map. and 
informative paragraphs 
of short, terse, italicized 
statements reflecting 
what else was going on 
around her. For example;

learns in school as well 
as from books, movies 
and, surprisingly, from

who roamed over post- 
war Europe. 

At 14 she was crying 
over the death of movie 
idol lames Dean (pining 
for the release of "Rebel

a young adult, the book is

However, she explains, 
when chronology seems 



A generation without 
fathers ... children fend 
for themselves while their 
mothers work. About 
385,000 Germans still live 
in camps." 

Tlie author was one of 
thoscchildren who played 
in the ruins yet she relates 
this experience as 
an adventure, one 
unlike the others of 
deprivation. She 
was almost always 
cold and hungry for 
something lo eat 
otherthan makeshift 
bread with lard, 
tired and dirty from 
an endless forage 
for coal and wood, 
and physically 

uncomfortable 
wearing clothing 
made from burlap 
sacks or walking 
barefoot or in 
shoes of any size or 
in any condition. 
Nevertheless, she also 
relates stories of happy 
family celebrations with

and of pranks, and 
report cards but most 



Without a Cause"), and 
studying Doris Day and 
Rock Hudson's interaction 
In "Pillow Talk." At 16 she 
attended a Billy Graham 
rally, and at 18 invited the 
young traveling Mormon 
missionaries whoknocked 
at the family door into 
her home, ostensibly to 
"improve her English" 
but most likely to test 
her Lutheran faith and 
upbringing — and even to 
improve her social life. 

At 20, she persuaded 
her parents to permit her 
to work in London as an 
au pair as still another way 
of furthering her study of 
English. At thistime, 1961. 
reports of the Eichmann 
trial began to appear in 
the English newspapers 
and on television. Then 
and there, she learned, 
on a larger scale, the 
atrocities committed by 
her countrymen. 

"Why had my parents, 
relatives, neighbors, and 
friends been so silent 
about the holocaust? Why 
did they tell us only about 
how ihey had suffered? 



How scared they had 
been when the bombs fell, 
when they were starving 
and freezing and walking 
home from 

Czechoslovakia in the 
company of thousands of 
miserable men, women, 
and children? ... As a child, 
I was too devastated by 
my parents' suffering to 
ask the questions that 
would sadden them all 
over again. Or. if I did 
pose sticky questions, it 
was only to learn more 
about their plight, and not 
someone else's. When 
Ihey told their stories, 
they often cried. I had 
read The Diary of Anne 
Frank as a teen, but I 
never talked to my parents 
about it. They hadn't read 
the book and they never 
asked mc questions about 
it, I guessed the silence 
meant I had to figure it 
out all by myself. Or did 
I avoid discussing the 
fate of this young woman 
because I wanted to make 
believe what I was reading 
couldn't possibly have 
happened? Didn't I want 
to know the trudi?" Wlicn 
confronted in England by 
"this horrific event from 
Germany's past", she 
feels vulnerable herself 
because of 'my country's 
shame"— and at the same 
time almost surprised by 
her feelings of love for 
her country, acountryfar 
different from the English 
view of a Germany 
encompassed by 

"mountains, lakes, beer, 
and sausage." Heartsick 
and homesick, Gehlert 
remembers a "beloved 
Northern landscape- 
-gentle hills, heather 
in sandy soil, villages 
surround by helds of grain 
as far as the eye could 
see,, .the rolling North Sea 
and its endless beaches." 
(She also missed, horribly, 
fried herring, her favorite 
dish). 

As she matures 



hiicllcciually and socially 
(her solution to "the boy- 
giri accepted thinking 
of the limes was, 'I 
informed him that if 1 
liked a boy, I \vouId kiss 
him"'), she began to 
think more and more 
about leaving Germany 
for a while. "Germany 
is a place tethered to the 
war and all the reminders 
of it," she observes. 
After experiencing the 
bleaknessanddeprivation 
of her formative years, a 
reader can identify with 
the author's interest in 
fashion or her enrollment 
in a course in the Art of 
Cooking French Cuisine 
or the exuberance of her 
family after their long 
wait for a telephone and a 
washing machine. 

As we compare her 
life story with ours, her 
maturation experience 
with ours, we admire 
even more her passage 
from die resourceful, 
rarely complaining child 
to an assertive, informed 
adult working woman 
who critically questions 
Gurmany's role in ihe war, 
who questions the roles 
of education and religion, 
who charts the course of 
her own sexuality — and 
ultimately the nature 
of her love affair with 
America, 

Recollections of a 
Hamburger succeeds in 
capturing the bittersweet 
coming-of-age of a lively, 
curious, intelligent, young 
girl and the process of her 
country's slow recovery 
from war. Thoughtful 
readers of (The Diary 
of Anne Frank) and Elie 
Wiesel's (Night) will 
want to add this book 
to their reading list: an 
entenaining and loving 
familymemoir,ahistorical 
account of a city under 
siege and occupation 
and a foreshadow of the 
emerging post-modern 
world. 



IPFW helps develop an appreciation for the Classical Music 



By Peter Schneltenberger 



Four local high school choirs came 
together Saturday for an all day festival 
event, fiill of workshops and classes, to 
help improve their musical performance 
in classical genre. 

At the end of the day, all four choirs 
put an the Ritz and applied their class 
room experience for the IPFW Three 
Rivers Choir Festiral Closing Concen in 
the Auer Peiformance Hall. 

Concordia Lutheran High School 
Acappella Choir, Leo Ir. Sr. High School 



Concert Choir, Snider High School 
Chamber Choir and Fort Wayne Youth 
Chorale all participated in this classical 
performance. Each group completed a 
set of three songs in their own distinc- 
tions and then two closing pieces as 
one combined choir. Each ensemble 
brought its own flavor to the concert. 
Snider High School Chamber Choir per- 
formed songs such as Noihin' Gonna 
Stumble My Feet by John Parker/ Greg 
Gilpin. Earth Song by Frank Tic heli. and 
Elijali Rock by Moses Hogan. Concordia 
Lutheran High School sang songs \viih a 
lighter feel such as Sing and Rejoice by 



Knut Nysted , A Prayer of St. Patrick by 
John Ruiter and ]ohn Saw de Numbuh 
arranged by Stacey V. Gibbs. 

Leo Hi^ School mLxed things up by 
adding an accompanist on piano, as welt 
as a flutist, choir member Kristen Weste- 
man. They presented The Road Home 
by Stephen Paulus, Where Dwells the 
Soul of My Love by David N- Childs and 
Toccata of Praise by Joseph M.Martin. 

The fourth Choir is of a different 
nature than the other three. "The Fon 
Wa&gt;Tie Vouih Chorale is made up of six- 
teen different schools including some 
that are home schooled... this group 



performs harder pieces, at an almost 
colligate level." said Todd O, Prickett, 
conductor of Fort Wayne Youth Chorale, 
and Director of Choral Studies, IPFW. 

They performed Laughing Song by 
David Dickau, I See the Universe by Da- 
vid L Brunner and Lei Everything That 
Hath Breath by feffery L Ames. All four 
choirs came together for two final songs. 
The first of which entitled Tunggare by 
Stephen Leek was conducted by Illinois 
State University's Director of Choral ac- 
tivides Kary I Carlson. Thelatlerofwhich 
named Footprints by David Dickau was 
conducted by Todd Prickett.

Hflenc Douchcz is a sioryiellcr. But her gifi 
lies noi in ihc wriiicn words of the pen - rather. 
her stories are told through the music she directs, 
iis the conductor of an orchestra. The Fort Wayne 
('hilharmonic presented several examples of her art 
rjn Saturday, Novembers, at the I-mbassy Theatre to 
;i sold-oui auditorium full of expectant listeners. 

Douchez nimbly approached the podium, her 
hlack frock coat swirling as she took the stage. The 
urthestra waited, then exploded into action with 
Fleelhoven's Coriolan Overture, op. 62. 

Taken from the writings of Livy and Plutarch, 
the slory of the Roman general Coriolanus is one of 
turmoil and unrest, which the orchestra illustrated 
magnificently. 

■ he brass section was like a nail gun, blasting 
sharp tacks of sound every so often; other notes were 
drawn oui, growing to great fortissimos before being 
Lnppcdoffwith the timpani. Absolute silence greeted 
fill' close of Mils work, as the audience tried to decide 
irihepiecehadreallycome to a close. Then came the 
applause. 

.Second on the program was Don Quixote, Op. 
:i5, a tone poem by Richard Strauss. Principal cellist 
llikaro Tamaki and principal violist Derek Reeves 
were showcased as soloists for this work, with Tamaki 
playingdie Quixote role and Reeves providingSancho 
I'anza's lines, 

The music opened softly with a calm flute 
introduction. As Boucher, softly conducted, the 
violins painted a picture of Quixote meandering 
about his grounds on a beautiful spring day, enjoying 
die fresh rippl); ofncw willow leaver, and sparkling, 
llbwing water. 

In the course of the piece, Quixote acquired the 



services of Sancho Panza, met and tilted with the 
windmills, took on the Emperor Alifanfaron. and 
rode through the air on a set of wooden horses. Under 
Bouchez's direction, the orchestra presented each 
new scene with unusual clarity, their best moment 
coming when the brass used muted instruments to 
tremolo through a herd of baaing sheep. 

The whole auditorium was nearly engulfed in a 
wooly cascade as Tamaki dashed in ^vilh a llurr)' of 
notes, heroically dispersing the horde. At the end 
of this piece, the music panned out. like a camera 
draiving back from the scene of Don Qubcotc's home, 
the melody giving a last, wistful sigh before the brass 
murmured 'the end'. 

Following the intermission, the orche.stni 
presented Debussy's Prelude to the Afternoon of a 
Faun and Stravinsky's Suite from the Firebird (1919 
edition). Bouchez had such control over the music 
that she merely nodded to the llute section when 
they began the 'Prelude'. 

The Firebird was more vigorous, a lively tale of a 
knight who liberates a magical 'firebird' and frees a 
number of princesses from an evil magician. At the 
end of the work in the Berceuse Finale, the wizard 
vvinked his eyes shut in magical sleep to the plinking 
of the harp. 

The knight and princess tip-toed outside as a 
French Horn blew a dawning melody that glowed 
like an early sunrise. 

Over a velvety grass carpet of strings, the morning 
broke into a glorious day of major harmony 
Celebratory brass blew a fanfare of victory, the 
tdongle shimmered, and the piece finished in 
explosive style. 

Members of the audience yelled and applauded,

calling Bouchez to the stage for three hows. The 
musicians themselves shuffled and stomped, making 
the stage rumble in approval as she accepted the 
applause and recognized the orchestra and soloists. 
It was a great night for music - and slnrytclling.

calls for jobs. Neighbors 
quickly latched on to ihls 
machine, especially our

would receive a call every

was in our living room, 
I tried to find reasons to 
stay in the room to listen 
to their conversations.

Passing of Proposition 8 

Gay rights hits unnecessary bricl&lt; wall 



By Mark Cox 

staff Wiilci 



On the November 
4lh election. Califor- 
nians voted 52.5 percent 
to 47.5 percent to pass 
Proposition 8, the act 
that would overturn the 
right for same-sex mar- 
riage across the stale to 
only allow same-sex cou- 
ples to marry. 

Since the 2005 over- 
turn of Proposition 22, 
the existing state law that 
limited marriage to op- 
posite-sex couples, more 
than 4,000 unfortunate 
same-sex marriages were 
performed. 

Nancy Pelosi, speaker 
of the House of Repre- 
sentatives, had a voice: "J 
am deeply disappointed 
by the passage of Propo- 
sition 8. This ballot mea- 
sure takes away individ- 
ual rights and freedoms. 
and is rooted in the poli- 
tics of division." 

In a nation where 
separation of church and 



state are at its utmost, 
political figures and the 
nation's residents see the 
marriage of same- sex 
couples as religious im- 
ptBcticality and immo- 
rality. Sure, our nation's 
children are no longer 
allowed to pray freely In 
public schools and may 
find "under God" within 
the Pledge of Allegiance 
a misconduct of separa- 
tion of church and state, 
yet we still find time to 
judge same- sex marriage 
on a religious-based 
viewpoint. 

On March 14. 2005. 
ludge Kramer ruled that 
California statutes lim- 
iting marriage to oppo- 
site-sex couples were un- 
consdtutional. African 
Americans were treated 
unfairly, in a way that 
was unconstitutional, 
and denied rights and 
segregated. 

Will we do this to our 
gay and lesbian popula- 
tion? Of course we will, 
until our nation decides 
that a same-sex marriage 
is just as productive and 
normal as an opposite- 



sex marriage, minus pro- 
creation. 

"Victory was not ours 
today. But the struggle 
for equality is not over," 
stated the 'No on Propo- 
sition 6' official website, 
after receiving news as its 
loss in llic election. "And 
you made the case to the 
people of California and 
to the rest of the world 
that discrimination— In 
any form— is unfair and 
wrong." 

This is defmitely a 
moral, religious, and so- 
cial issue which everyone 
has an opinion about — 
but in my eyes, not only 
are you taking the rights 
away from others, but 
you are discriminating 
the fact that they cannot 
help their feelings. 

Love is love, and no- 
body can lake that away 
from someone — picture 
being banned from get- 
ting hitched to the per- 
son you love most of all. 
It is not up to anyone to 
stop others from making 
"immoral' decisions just 
because of personal per- 
spectives.

the victim needs is even 
more crucial. Don't give

According lo Da- 
vis, the first step to mak- 
ing a difference is getting 
information lo viciims 
and what their options 
ate in terms of getting

From Page 12 



"II was a good experience and 
different kind of experience because 
you are coming into placesyou are not 
familiar iviih,' McBobens said of his 
timein the D-League, bul made sure lo 
note that he doesn't intend to go back 
there an&gt;iime soon. 

"If it happens, I'll make the most of 
it but obviously it's not somelhing that 
I'm planning on." 

For now, McRoberts' focus is lifted 
from die past and onto a future back 
home in Indiana. So far, he has not 
logged any regular season minutes 
for the team, but feels that ihey are 
developing nicely and because of their 
work ethic and defensive structure that 
the Pacers will surprise a lot of people. 

They have already surprised the 
defending N'BA champion Boston 
Celtics, who Indiana topped for iheir 
first win of the 2008-2009 season. 

"We've done prett&gt;- well in our first 
three games. We struggled a litde bit in 
those but we Stan off ivith some of the 
best teams in the league but that also 
shows us where we need to get lo be 
a playoff team.' The Pacers last made 
the playogsin the 2005-2006 season. 



The comfons of home have helped 
McRoberts while he wails his turn lo get 
more playing time. He's doing his part 
to learn from veteran post teammates 
like Jeff Foster and even helping to 
mentor rookie Roy Hibbert as much 
as possible while still competing every 
day wiih the two for a spot somewhere 
in the rotation. Says McRoberts, being 
a home is that much more imporlani 
because NBA life isn't always so easy. 

'I takesa lot more than people would 
think. People think that you go in for 
practice for an hour or two a day and 
you are done for the rest of the day but 
it's pretty much like a 9 lo 3 job for the 
most part." 

So right now. he will work (hat job. 
roll with the punches and coniinue 
to contribute. He's been at the top. 
been at the bottom, been criticized 
and adored. Josh McRobeiis has seen 
the highs and lows of his business and 
now is ready lo find that stable line 
somewhere in between the risk and 
rew*ard, the cloudy days and the bright 
sunshine. 

Good thing for him that now he gets 
to do all of that at home.

basketball preview 



pg.l 




A NBA player earlier than expected by most, a Trail Blazer less 
than expected by himself; Josh McRoberts is finally home 



lune 26, 2008 was tirafi night for ihc National 
Baskutbnll Association. Players were moving here, 
there and cvery\vliere. But in Indiana, only one was 
returning home, culminating a winding road that 
was ihc previous four years ofhis basketball life. 

Fans, sports writers and other vocal critics once 
put the heat on him for leaving his home state and 
choosingtoplaycollegc basketball at Duke University. 
Where once he was a phenom for Carmel High 
School, a McDonald's Ail-American and Gatorade 
National High School Athlete of the Year- he became 
almost like public enemy number one for a period of 
time, even getting shut out of what should have been 
a runaway race for Indiana's coveted Mr. Basketball. 

Now, as the 2008-2009 NBA season has begun. Josh 
McRoberts is back where it all began. And honestly, 
he couldn't be happier. 

"Wlien 1 first heard it, I didn't really believe it and 
then it hit me and I got excited right away," McRoberts 
said ofthe]une26news that he would be playing his 



second NBA season back in Indianapolis, now with 
'Pacers' across his chest. 

When McRoberts left the state following a stellar 
senior season in 2005. it didn't feel much like home 
anymore. Despite havinga runaway year individually, 
his team stalled in a lough Sectional and lost in the 
semi-finals. That was all the ammo that bitter state- 
faithful decision makers need to freeze him out of 
being named Mr. Basketball for the state. 

"It's kind of funny that I took the most heat for it 
for some reason and nobody really said anything 
to INBA players] (Mike) Conley or (Gregl Oden or 
{Marquette senior) Dominic James or anybody like 
that," McRoberts said with a nostalgic disbelief in his 
voice. 

But McRoberts put that scorn and the state of 
Indiana aside. He played two seasons al Duke, 
collecting ACC All-Defensive, All-Freshman and 
All- Tournament honors along the way. Then, he 
made another partially unpopular decision when he 
declared himself eligible for the 2007 NBA Draft. 

On Draft night, he was scorned again- falling to the 
37th overall selection, more than 15 spots lower than 



he and his agent expected him to be picked, even in a 
worst case scenerlo. But McRoberts will tell you, even 
that setback was just part of the unpredictable path 
to get to the point where he is now. 

"It was the worst day of my life," McRoberts says 
without hesitation, but is quick to note that it turned 
out for the best. 

McRoberts moved out west to Portland to join 
longlimefriendGregOden, who had been the number 
one pick in the same draft. The two had previously 
played alongside eachother as part of the dominating 
Spiece Indy Heat A/\U team, 

"It was a lot of fun being up there with Greg, he 
was going through the same thing so we just helped 
eachother out. Seeing a familiar face all the time 
made it a little bit easier," McRoberts noted. 

Unfonunatly for McRoberts, his turbulant road was 
going to take more twists and turns. He played just 
eight games in his rookie year, averaging |ust three 
and a half minutes and one and a half points. A good
