Chancellor applications studied 



By M1CHELE R. SHAFFER 
Managing Editor 
Since their first organizational 
meeting on Oct. 25, 1985, the IPFW 
Chancellor Search and Screen com- 
mittee has received a "goodly num- 
ber" of candidates and nominations, 
said Joanne Lantz, chair of the 
department of Psychological Sciences, 
at the Fort Wayne Faculty Senate 
meeting Monday. 

Lantz is also a member of the Search 
and Screen Committee. Two other 
members of the committee, Joseph 
Chandler, associate professor of 
supervision, and Joseph Davis, 
associate professor of chemistry, were 
present at the senate meeting Monday, 
but did not comment on the com- 
mittee's progress. 

However, John Huie, secretary of 
the Search and Screen Committee, 
said Monday in a telephone interview, 
"We've had in the neighborhood Of 
about 60 (applicants)." Huie, who is 
also executive assistant to Steven 
Beering, president of Purdue 
University, said the applications have 
been coming in from all parts ol the 
country. Applications and nominations 
have arrived from New Jersey, Texas, 
Georgia, Louisiana, California, 
Michigan, Wisconsin, North Dakota 
and several from Indiana. 

When asked if any applications had 
been received from any Fort Wayne 
community members, Huie paused 
and said, "It's not appropriate for me 
to indicate where other than Indiana." 
According to Donald Brown, Vice 
Chancellor of Academic Services at 
Purdue University and chairman of 
the committee, a number of excellent 
people have expressed an interest in 
the position, and applications have 
been arriving daily. 

Members of the committee have 
declined to comment regarding 
specifically who has been nominated 
or has submitted an application. 
According to Lantz, "We already 
agreed in the committee we would not 
discuss names of candidates or of 




itz, chair of the department of psychological 
sciences, and Maynard Mansfield, chairman of the 
department ot mathematical sciences, listen to a fellow 



member speak at the Fort Wayne faculty s

nominees.'' Acting Chancellor Edward 
Nicholson was unavailable for com- 
ment on his status. Lantz explained the 
purpose of the gag measure was to 
protect the candidates from having 
their names "bantered about" in the 
public. Lantz said this sort of treat- 
ment might prevent applicants from 
coming forth to the committee. 

From approximately 60 ap- 
plications, the committee will try to 
narrow the pool down to about 20, 
according to Huie. The committee met 
yesterday to go through the screening 
process. "We've had four sub- 
committees going through the resumes 
to facilitate (the process)," said Huie. 
"Everyone has had access to all the 
names." According to Huie, each of 
the subcommittees will receive an 
equal number of applications to 
screen. If any subcommittee has any 
questions about a resume or ap- 



plication, they then forward it to 
another committee to review. 

By mid-March, the committee hopes 
to have a list of about four to six 
finalists to give to Indiana University 
President John Ryan and Purdue 
University President Steven Beering. 
At that point, "the committee is saying 
to (them), 'Based on the information 
we have, any of these applicants would 
be acceptable,'" said Huie Monday, 
After this has been done, (he can- 
didates are expected to visit the 
campus and the Fort Wayne com- 
munity before the final week of the 
spring semester, beginning May 5. 

The advertisement for the chan- 
cellorship has appeared in several 
higher education publications, for 
instance the Chronicle of Higher 
Educalion. At the Faculty Senate 
meeting Monday. Lantz addressed the 
rumors surfacing thai the Feb. 3 



deadline was extended. Lantz ex- 
plained to the senate the deadline was 
extended because the advertisements 
did not appear a sufficient number of 
times in the Chronicle. She said the 
advertisement ran again, but not in 
time to allow interesled parties to 
submit applications by Feb. 3. The 
committee extended the deadline to 
Wed.. Feb. 12 at 3;3Gp.m„ the time the 
search and screen committee went 
into session yesterday, 

However, Huie said Monday the 
deadline was not officially or formally 
extended, in the advertisement itself. 
When asked about Lantz's statements 
in the senate meeting, Huie said the 
committee within itself had decided to 
make the extension so they could 
consider applications that were 
received after the published deadline. 
Huie added "a couple" applications 
did come in after Feb. 3. 



Faculty Senate approves 1987-88 calendar 



By MICHELE SHAFFER 
Managing Editor 

The Academic Calendar for 1987-88 was approved by the IPFW Faculty Senate 
at their meeting Monday. 

The calendar is as follows: 

Classes of the fall semester ot 1987 will begin on August 24. They will be 
suspended for a Labor Day break the weekend of Sept. 4-8. The mid-semester 
break that usually falls at the end of October is scheduled for Oct 8-9. 
Thanksgiving break will begin after the last class on Nov. 25 and continue through 
Nov. 29. The last week of classes is scheduled for Dec. 14-20. 

The spring semester of 1988 is scheduled to begin on Monday, Jan. It. The spring 
recess is presently scheduled for March 6-13. The last week of classes for the 
spring semester of 1988 will be May 2-8. 

Some questions were raised about the inclusion of another early spring break 
This semester, spring break falls on March 8-16. Previously, it coincided with the 
spring break of Fort Wayne Community Schools. 

Robert Barratt, chair of the Educational Policy Committee, said that although 
some faculty expressed interest in a faculty survey concerning the dates of spring 
break, the calendar subcommittee felt "a survey of the faculty on spring break 



was not in order at this time." Barratt, who is also chairman of the computer 
technology department, said the subcommittee decided to let people "experience 
the early spring break." and then a survey could be taken next year Barratt 
added thai if the faculty didn't like it, then changes could be made. 

So, at Barratt's suggestion, Uie senate adopted the calendar with the knowledge 
that the dales could be changed 

In other business: 

Joanne Lantz, chair of the department of Psychological Sciences and presiding 
officer of the Faculty Senate announced Monday that IPFW was the recipient of 
Purdue University's 2nd Annual Affirmative Action award. Tonight, the 
university will receive the $10,000 award at a ceremony in West Lafayette Lantz 
said the money would go to support the other affirmative action efforts at IPFW. 
At the senate meeting, Lantz commended Donna Middleton, equal opportunity 
officer; Sandra Ellison, coordinator of special counseling services, John Ulmer, 
dean of Student Services. 

The date or the faculty convocation for the spring semester was also announced. 
On April 10, James Falloon, the plant manager of Fort Wayne's new General 
Motors plant, will speak to the faculty. Lantz said he will probably oe speaking 
about why GM chose Fort Wayne, the effects they will have on the community and, 
the interrelation of GM and IPFW — how they can benefit each other. 



Indiana-Purdue: university combination a first 



By EARL SMITH 
Chief Reporter 

The developmeni of IPFW is unusual 
in the chronicles of higher education. 
A. W. Kettler, Sr., former Purdue 
trustee, once said the combination of 
Indiana University and Purdue 
University programs in Fort Wayne 
was the first time two state univer- 
sities tried to operate on a single 
campus 

"I don't think either institution 
wanted the whole pie I think there was 
a reluctance to believe that maybe 
they could merge their interests and 
successfully operate together," said 
John Hastings, president of the 
Indiana University Board of Trustees 
during the late I950's. 

Purdue was holding classes in a 
downtown Fort Wayne building which 
was outliving its usefulness. In ad- 
dition, the idea of the two universities 
having separate buildings side-by-side 
seemed a wasteful expense. 

"Some state legislators have felt the 
consolidation of the two centers in one 
building, still retaining their separate 
identities, would ultimately lower 
costs of operation, " said a Fort Wayne 
newspaper on Sept. 29, 1956. 

Purdue was (he first to investigate to 
use of farm land north of Fort Wayne 
which was owned by the Department 
of Mental Health. R. B. Stewart, then 
vice-president of Purdue, approached 



Ihe governor with a request to have the 
farm made available for Purdue's use. 

Governor Harold Handley was open 
to the suggestion with one condition. 
"You have to put Purdue and Indiana 
together in Fort Wayne," Handley 
said. 

"That's a big order," Stewart 
replied 

Who would be responsible for 'the 
physical plant was solved by the in- 
corporation of the Indiana-Purdue 
Foundation. Its board of directors 
included five Indiana trustees, five 
Purdue trustees, and five Fort Wayne 
executives. The Education Building 
(now Kettler Hall) was occupied in the 
fall of 1964. 

During the next decade, there was 
rapid growth. The idea of the 
universities having extensions was 
abandoned and the regional campus 
concept came into being. Indiana and 
Purdue students were able to obtain 
undergraduate degrees at Fort Wayne 
beginning in 196B. 

In 1964, approximately 3,000 students 
took classes in Kettler. By 1970, over 
6,000 students attended IPFW 
Students could choose from 13 Purdue 
baccalaureate programs or ten 
Indiana programs. Both offered 
degrees in certain areas such as 
English. 

"It became evident that two small 
departments providing similar or 



duplicate offerings could be replaced 
by a single large department," wrote 
John Ankenbruek in his history of 
IPFW, "The Creation Years." 

However, change and the unification 
of campus administration did not come 
easily, said John Ulmer, Dean of 
Student Services. Often there were 
calls for campus independence due to 
frustration with bureaucracy, said 
Ulmer. 

An improvement in course offerings 
came in the late 1960s when the two 



universities agreed on mission course 
assignments. These decisions were 
made at Bloomington and West 
Lafayette, said Michael Downs, 
chairman of the political science 
department. 

Shortly thereafter, departments 
began to be established 

Throughout the last two decades 
these changes have improved 
academics for the student ; but now an 
increasing number of students are 
attending for other reasons than to get 
a degree from Indiana or Purdue. 



Books provide benefits 

By EARL SMITH 
Chief Reporter 

Bob Schultz, president of Dine-a-Mate, spoke to the Student Senate last week 
about how IPFW students could benefit from the Dine-a-Mate program. 

"The success of the program depends on a well organized committee," said 
Schultz. He stressed the book becomes more valuable to the purchaser the 
more it is used. 

The book includes a wide range of coupons, Schultz said, including savings on 
dining, theater, fitness, cinema and bowling. 

Gina Kostoff presented the SUBOG report for Lisa Sewell. Lisa 
Buckles, SUBOG concert chair, is working with Snickerz Comedy Bar to bring 
Yakoff Smirnoff, the Russian comedian, to Fort Wayne. Smirnoff will appear 
on a Sunday, Monday or Tuesday during Harbor Arbor Days. 

Two resolutions were adopted: One sets guidelines for the acquisition and 
use of a bulletin board for used book sales; the other requests the university 
paint two crosswalks on East Campus drive "with reflective yellow paint in a 
diagonal pattern."

Department offers 
inadequate experience 



In Ihe IPFW Bulletin under the 
heading "Introduction to IPFW," the 
goals and services of this institution are 
generally stated. Such statements 
include: "IFPW ... encourages the full 
and responsible exercise of academic 
freedom." 

IPFW offers its students opportunities 
to study in university programs of high 
guality, ..." 

"Students are thus prepared ... for 
satisfying roles in employment..." 

"An aggressive affirmative-action 
program encourages these groups to 
pursue educational goals of their choice 
and to seek advancement in careers 
previously closed to them." 

"To maximize students' educational 
potential. IPFW offers ... a complete 
range of educational services These 
include ... well-equipped, modern 
classrooms, laboratories,.." 

If these statements were in an ad for 
the Radio-TV-Film degree, the 
university should be charged with false 
advertisement. 

Located in the basement of Helmke 
Library are television and radio studios 
and control rooms. These facilities are 
used as the laboratories for the 
production classes needed to obtain a 
Radio-TV -Film degree. 

This sounds all well and good, but a 
major problem exists with the 
equipment located in these laboratories. 



Most of the time me equipment, 
especially in the Television Control 
Room, does not operate efficiently. 

Students pay tuition and lab fees to 
learn radio and TV production, 
supposedly a "program of high quality." 
Where is all this money going? Certainly 
not into the repair or purchase of 
equipment! 

Students are always told hands-on 
experience is one of the best forms of 
education, and experience is the key to 
the job market. However, Radio-TV- 
Film majors are not permitted to use the 
facilities unless they are taking a 
production class, even if such a class is 
not offered. 

The major problem in this situation is 
that students are not allowed access to 
these facilities in order to prepare their 
resume tapes. Current administration 
considers this to be personal use. 

The laboratories have been compared 
to university telephones and 
typewriters, which are not for personal 
use. Telephones and typewriters cannot 
be compared to labs for which students 
pay special fees. These labs are to 
prepare students in the department for 
graduation and employment Aren't 
resume tapes essential in securing jobs 
in this market? It seems that certain 
departmental administration and 
faculty do not think so. After all 
they're already employed.

They are moral, 
most of the time 



Voices Across IPFW/ 



By 
Mark Russell 



So, Jerry Falwell is 
changing the name of the 
Moral Majority to the 
Liberty Federation. How 
bland. It's as if "The 
Crusades" had been 
changed to "Club Med." 

What's wrong with the 
name Moral Majority? At 



least you know who they are 
— people who are moral, the 
majority of the time. What 
they do on weekends even 
Falwell doesn't know about. 
Liberty Federation has 
neither fire nor hrimstone. 
The name sounds like a 



savings and loan bank. A 
more accurate name would 
be, "The Committee to 
Reelect President Marcos. " 
Falwell's television show 
could be called. "Dialing for 
Kruggera rands."

Luther' opens at PIT

GREVEN 

Features Editor 

Luther through the eyes of 
John Osborne and Larry L. 
Life at PIT this weekend. 

Witness Luther — the man 
behind the dramatic and 
often bloody split with the 
Roman Catholic Church and 
the author of the simple, 
haunting Christmas Carol, 
Away in a Manger. 

"This play is not a tired 
and predictable costume 
drama or merely a pretty 
historical pageant. Luther is 
an exciting exploration of a 
human being's search to find 
himself — and in the 
process, alters the course of 



mankind," explained Life, 
director of the play. 

Life brings us Luther the 
man — complete with self- 
doubts, bodily ailments and 
brilliant intellectual 
achievements in this award- 
winning play by Osborne. 

Tonsured (bald spot 
shaved intcrthe crown to look 
like a Medieval monk, Joel 
K. Murray, instructor in 
theatre and PIT director, 
makes his acting debut at 
PIT in the lead role of 
Luther. 

Murray portrays Luther 
as a man who refused to 
relinquish his principles — a 
frightened man and insecure 
son who was at odds with his 



family as a result of 
disobeying his father, who 
wanted him to become a 
lawyer. 

This turmoil that pitted 
father against son extended 
to the priests who clung to 
Latin for mass, despite the 
preference of the vernacular 
language preferred by the 
commoners. 

Performances will be 
weekends, tomorrow night 
through March 1. Tickets are 
S5 for general admission, 54 
for senior citizens and S3 for 
IPFW students. The PIT box 
office is open from 1:30 to 
4:30 p.m., Tuesdays through 
Saturdays. Tickets are now 
on sale.

"1 love painting and color

explained Bradley. "I am

The end result of Bradley's

with ribbons of paint in-

Bradley listens to music 
while he paints in his studio. 
"I could say that this is a 
visual form of music." 

This series of paintings is

Noble Roman's 

Georgetown North 
10 minutes by car too long to get order 



Noble Roman's pizza parlors have enjoyed the 
reputation for being the first establishment to bring us 
irge screen entertainment, 

Part of growing up in "The Fort" is laughing al the 
antics of Laurel and Hardy, complete with the requisite 
player piano tinkling in the background while pigging 
out on pizza with our gang. Being overcome with 
nostalgia, I decided once again to make the trip to Noble 
Roman's to have pizza with a girlfriend and laugh at the 
ilap-slick movies. 

In the process, I learned that what they say is true: 
'you can never go back." 

The basic set-up of the parlor remains the same. No 
major surprises there. Groups of kids were there, no 
doubt enjoying their snow day. That's where my mental 
' lage of the pizza parlor ended and harsh reality took 

Instead of watching the movies projected onto the 
irge screen, the kids were singing along with a hard- 
rock song that was blaring over the p. a. system, 
prohibiting all normal conversation. The decor was the 
best part of this dining experience. 
The pizza maker, faced with at least nine people for 
30 p.m. "rush" had a hard time gue Estimating 
preparation times. A 17-minute Son of Monster pizza 
as transormed into a 30-minute monster. 

To fend off complete starvation, I look a look at the 
salad bar — quickly deciding that I wasn't that hungry. 
What confronted me was an array of pre-mixed salads 
on the cart, such as three bean, pasta and tomato 
relish, all complete with dressing. This is not a new 
menu item, but a result of patrons haphazardly 
preparing their own salads, complete with a selection of 
dressing drizzled over each container." Except the 
pineapple — which could explain why it was dried out. 

There must be one new menu item, however. It was a 
free topping on the pizza, disguised as cutlery wrapped 
napkin. Ours was squished into the part of the pizza 
that had the most cheese, 

So, pizza lovers, if you like hard-rock blaring over a 
scratchy p. a. system, unintentionally pre-mixed (and 
dressed) salads and surprise toppings, by all means, 
make tracks to Noble Romans at Georgetown North. 
They're waiting.

IPFW defeats Michigan 



By CLAV HOUSHOLDER 
The IPFW men's 
volleyball learn defeated the 
University of Michigan. 15-6, 
15-11 and 15-8, in a match at 
the Multipurpose Building 
last Wednesday. The 15- 
rated Volleydons used a 
balanced attack to sweep all 
three games of the match by 
utilizing strong offensive and 
defensive play. 

Two kills by Bob Kramer 
and one each from Ted Owen 
and Loren Gebert broke a 4-4 
stalemate in the first game, 
in which the Wolverines got 
no closer. Precision- 
hammered service aces, and 
a strong blocking defense 
didn't allow the Michigan 
team lo get on track 



throughout the match. 

In the second game, the 
Mastodons started their 
attack from an 0-3 deficit, 
but kilts by Gebert and Owen 
off of strong sets by Phil 
Bodine quickly turned the 
tide. After two service aces 
by Troy White, the "Dons 
assumed a 7-4 lead, which 
was equalized in the middle 
of the match at 9-9 and 10-10, 
as both teams struggled to 
take control of the serve 
Two more service aces from 
the Mastodon's Jay Gold- 
steyn gave IPFW the lead 
and momentum needed to 
carry the rest of the game. 

The third game was 
another back and forth 
struggle in the beginning. 
but aces on serves by Keith 



Neargardener and O.J. 
Berzins kept the Michigan 
attack at bay in the earlier 
part of the game. Kills from 
Kramer and Berzine, again 
from good sets by Phil 
Bodine, led the Mastodon's 
charge to victory ' n this 
third and final game of the 

Aggressive front line play 
on both offense and defense 
helped the Mastodons dic- 
tate the tempo of most of the 
match. The intense attack of 
the 'Don's front line on both 
the offensive and defensive 
sides of the net, combined 
with good passing and a 
powerful service game, gave 
the Mastodons all the 
necessary ingredients lor a 
potential victory recipe.

Last Thursday, the 

Mastodons were defeated by 

Bellarmine University, 90- 

76, in Louisville. 

Bellarmine was red-hot 
from the field, shooting 60 
percent, and with 28 at- 
tempts from thefoul line. 

Lawrence Jordan scored a 
season high 20 points, and 
Richard Ivy grabbed seven 
rebounds for IPFW. 

On Saturday. IPFW 
traveled to Indiana Central 
and came away losing 58-59. 

Ivy led the Mastodons with 
23 points and seven rebounds 
in a game that was close all 
the way through. The 
Mastodons led through most 



of the first half, but never got 
beyond a six point lead. 
Indiana Central managed to 
score with seven seconds left 
in the half to take a 30-29 lead 
at the buzzer. 

The second half was a see- 
saw battle the whole way, 
but Indiana Central clinched 
the victory with two free 
throws at the 16-second 

In women's basketball, 
Torn Lydy scored 22 points 
and pulled in 12 rebounds in 
a losing cause as 
powerhouse Bellarmine 
defeated the IPFW women's 
basketball team. 90-71, in

Stephanie Bean and Clara 
Trowbridge chipped in 
eleven points each for the 
Lady Mastodons, but all five 
of Bellarmine's starters 
scored in double figures. 

On Saturday. IPFW fell to 
Indiana Central. 80-68. Terri 
Lydy had a career high 18 
rebounds while scoring 24 
points to lead the Lady 
Mastodons. 

In an interview, Coach 
Julie Calahan said the game 
was much closer than the 
score indicated. IPFW 
trailed by only four points 
with three minutes 
remaining, but three con- 
secutive turnovers resulted 
in six quick points for the 
Greyhounds. 



The IPFW men's 
volleyball team traveled to 
Ohio State University 
Saturday and Sunday for a 

volleyball tournament, 
competing with six other 
teams. The teams par-

State. The scores from the 
East Strausburgh match 
were: 10-15. 15-4, 15-11, 8-15, 
and 11-15. The scores from

Jim Morlan, a 6'7" junior 
who has been a starter all 
three at IPFW under Coach 
Tim Russell, recently 
displayed his ability to make 
the big play under pressure: 
he pulled down an important 
rebound in heavy traffic and 
then put it right back up to 
score with only four seconds 
left in the regulation, sen- 
ding the Great Lakes Valley 
Conference game with 
Indiana Central into over- 
time. Later in the extra 
period, Morlan drilled a 10- 
foot jumper for what proved 
to be the winning basket. 



During this season, a 
rebuilding year for Coach 
Russell's Mastodons, Morlan 
has had to be a team leader 
and the main workhorse. He 
leads the team in minutes 
played with just over 32 
minutes per game, is third in 
scoring with 9 3 points per 
game and second in 
rebounding with 5.9. Morlan 
also has the distinct honor of 
being tlK' team captain in 
only his junior year.

Jim has had to work very 
hard to achieve the talent he 
has," said Coach Russell. 
"He is an over-achiever and 
always gives me everything 
he's got." Russell went on to 
say, "Jim is very important 
to our team and has the 
respect of his coaches. He is 
an effective power forward 
and is capable of making the 
switch to center where we 
can utilize his strength." 

Morlan, an electrical 
engineering technology 
major, takes his studies very 
seriously. He carries a 3.5 
GPA, as well as par- 
ticipating in basketball.
