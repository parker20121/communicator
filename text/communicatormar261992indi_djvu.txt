NEWS BRIEFS 

STUDENT SENATE FUNDS 
BOOK EXCHANGE SYSTEM 

IPFW's student senate started a new program, known as 
the Collegiate Book Exchange Network, to help students 
buy or sell used textbooks. 

According to James Kruse, who helped set up the book 
exchange, students can enter into a computer information 
on the book they want to sell. Then other students can 
readily access the information. 

"The system is easy to use. It was designed for students 
not familiar with computers," said Kruse. 

The service is free, and students can access the system 
with a computer in the IPSGA office located in Walb 
Memorial Union, Room 225. 

Student government hopes for a big response, according 
to Kruse. 'The new system will especially benefit stu- 
dents with books from core classes such as Math 153. 
Everyone uses those books," said Kruse. 



PARKING FINE INCREASE 
APPROVED BY UNIVERSITY 

Beginning this fall, LPFW will collect higher fines for 
parking and traffic violations. 

The new fines were approved by the Purdue University 
Board of Trustees who modified parking and traffic regu- 
lations on all Purdue campuses during their meeting at 
D?FW on Friday, March 20. 

"It is apparent from the number or parking tickets that 
arc being written that the current fine structure no longer 
serves as an adequate deterrent," said Paul Sirouts, inter- 
im chief of police and director of safety. In 1991, the 
number of tickets rose lo 15,095. The total has increased 
on average of 19 percent each year in the last five years, 
he said. 

Moving violation fines will increase from $10 to $40. 
and the fine for parking illegally in handicapped parking 
areas will rise from $10 lo $20. 

Failure to register a vehicle, improper parking, improper 
display or no display of permit, and failure to pay within 
required time period will result in a $10 fine, up from $5. 

Meter violations and all bicycle violations will be fined 
at $5 instead of $2. 

Displaying a lost, stolen, or altered permits will cost the 
offender $35. up from $25; and parking in a designated 
fire lane will cost the offender $30 instead of $20. 

"All revenues generated by the parking fines are put 
back into parking facilities and equipment," said Strouts. 
"The bottom line, however, is increased traffic control 
effectiveness." 



GEOGRAPHY LECTURE STARTS 
MONTH-LONG SERIES 

Howard Doughty, chairman of the world Vista founda- 
tion, will present "Gcographia," a lecture on geography's 
impact on history. 

The lecture will be held on March 31, in Ncff Recital 
Hall at 7:30 p.m. Admission is free and open to the pub- 
lic. 

Doughty will discuss the theory that much of history 
and current events can be explained in terms of their 
geography. 

According to Doughty, geography is not really a study 
of places and names but rather a study of forces which 
have shaped the world. 

"Geographia" is one of several upcoming lectures spon- 
sored by the lecture series subcommittee of the faculty 
senate. 

On April 7 a lecture titled "The Fall of the Soviet Union 
and Rise of the New Russia" will feature Tatiana 
Yankclevich. Yankelevich is the daughter of Elena 
Bonner and the late nobel peace laureate, Andrei 
Sakharov. 

Richard Underwood, retired NASA's director of photog- 
raphy, will present "Earth from Space" on April 21. 

And Dame Helen Suzman, former member of the South 
African Parliament will be featured in "South Africa in 
Transition" on April 28. 

All lectures will be held in Neff Recital Hall and will 
begin at 7:30 p.m. Admission to all lectures if free.

Soil contamination problem raises questions 



By Sarah Jakucky 
Features Editor 

A gasoline leak which contam- 
inated soil on the site o( the new 
Engineering and Technology 
Building could pose a health 
risk. 

Don Kattcr, Physical Plant 
director, said "At no time was 
anyone under risk during this 
project." However, experts at 
the Indiana Department of 
Environmental Management arc 
not so sure. 

"Danger! Extremely flammable. 
Contains lead. Vapor harmful. 
Harmful if swallowed or aspirat- 
ed into lungs. Use as motor fuel 
Only." 

This is the warning statement 
from Amoco's gasoline material 
safely data sheet Although the 
safety sheet considers gasoline a 
dangerous chemical, Kattcr said 
the gasoline spill on campus was 
not a risk. 

Kattcr said construction crews 
discovered something was not 
right with IPFW soil when exca- 
vation began on the Engineering 
and Technology Building. 

"The soil smclled of a strong 



petroleum product," Kattcr said. 
A month later he said the soil 
was analyzed by (he Indiana 
Department of Environmental 
Management. The soil was 
diagnosed as containing gaso- 
line. 

Don Filzpatrick, of the IDEM, 
said Tuesday that he knew noth- 
ing about IPFW's case and 
could not locate any information 
about the soil contamination. 



"At no time was anyone 
under a risk during this 
project" -Don Kalter 



Filzpatrick said IPFW is 
required by law to contact the 
IDEM in the event of suspected 
soil contamination. 

Kattcr said the soil was 
removed from campus in May 
of 1991. However, he said he 
docs not recall the details of the 
disposal because "a lot of water 
has gone under the bridge since 
then." 

When Katlcr first discussed the 
soil contamination problem with 
The Communicator last week, 



he explained that the hazardous 
din was "disposed of by taking 
it to an open ground away from 
IPFW to allow the fumes to 
evaporate into the air." 

The spill was contained to a 
small clay pocket underneath the 
surface, Kattcr said. He also 
said the contamination was con- 
fined to a specific area and put 
no one at risk. 

On Tuesday of this week, 
Katlcr said the soil was disposed 
of differently. He said the haz- 
ardous soil is still on campus, 
but "away from where people 

Kalier refused to reveal the 
enact location because "it's not 
imponant to anyone." 

The method of disposal IPFW 
used was very efficient, saving 
the school lime and money, 
Kattcr said. 

He said the removal of ihc 
gasolinc-laccd soil could have 
been expensive if it had to be 
taken to a landfill. 

The gasoline spill, according to 
Kattcr. is believed to have been 
caused from an old, leaky fuel 
lank. The fuel lank, he said, is

IPFW professor's new book 
may soon become a movie 



By Jim Walker 
Editor in Chief 

Louis Cantor is a busy man. 

Hollywood producers are 
calling. His literary agent 
leaves a message. Someone 
from New York wants to 
write a Broadway play about 
his life. 

Cantor, an IPFW associate 
professor of history, is hard ai 
work promoting his new book 
"Wheelin' on Bcalc," which 
may soon be made into a 
movie. 

In his spare lime. Cantor is 
working on a screenplay ver- 
sion of "Beale," along with 
researching his next book and 
gelling ready to leach this 
summer. 

"Everything is really crazy 
right now. Sure, it's exciting. 
And it is great, but it's also 
crazy because I don't know 
what the hell is happening." 
Cantor said. 

My life is usually pretty 
bland, pretty structured, but 
now I've got Hollywood pro- 
ducers inviiing me to come 
out to California to meet peo- 
ple." 

Cantor's book, which is pub- 
lished by Pharos Press, is 
available al bookstores in the 
mall and al Follctt's on cam- 
pus. The book chronicles the 
history of WD1A, the innova- 
tive Memphis radio station 
where Cantor worked in the 
1950s. 

WDIA was the first radio 
station in ihc United States to 
go to an all-black format. The 
station's deejays were all 
black and all of the music was 
recorded by black artists. 

Canior worked at the WDIA 
control board while he attend- 
ed Memphis State University 
as an undergraduate. 

"Il was an unusual time and 
a unique situation," Cantor 
said of the station. "WDIA set 



off a media revolution. When 

I was there 1 didn't realize all 
that was going on, but 1 knew 
il was important," 

Today, Cantor's book is 
proving important in its own 
right. 

The Center for Southern 
Folklore in Memphis opened 
an exhibit called "WDIA, 
Making Black Waves" to 
coincide with ihc February 
release of Cantor's book. 

The guest list at the party 
for Cantor's book release and 
the exhibits opening included 
blues notables B.B. King, 
Rufus Thomas, and Bobby 
Blue Bland. Memphis Mayor 

"WDIA set off a media 
revolution. When I was 
there I didn 't realize all 
that was going on, but I 
knew it was important." 
-Louis Cantor 

Willie Hercndon was also on 
hand. 

Canior said 500 people 
attended the opening event. 

"The parly was a lot of fun. 

II was a big happening," 
Canior said. 

The opening party was just 
the first step in Cantor's pro- 
moling process. He held a 
book signing before introduc- 
ing Thomas at IPFW on Feb. 
28. 

Blues man Thomas per- 
formed here as part of the 
African-American History 
Month celebration. 

Canior said he will be doing 
an interview soon on National 
Public Radio. 

But Canior is most excited 
aboul the prospect of having 
his book become a movie. 

"My agent said, given the 
number of people interested, 
he's almost certain somebody 
will pick it up," noted Canior. 



Canior said inquiries have 
come from HBO. Bill 
Cosby 's production company, 
and other producers. 

"One producer calls me 
almost every day from 
Hollywood," Canior said. 

He said one of the producers 
told him "New Jack City" 
star Wesley Snipes was inter- 
ested in the project. 

Cantor noted that he hopes 
to take part in ihc movie- 
making process. "I'm not all 
that concerned with how 
much money I make. 1 am 
more concerned with how ihc 
movie is made," he said. 

"I want to take part in that. 
I'd like to be a technical con- 
sultant," Cantor said. 

The producers who have 
called so far have expressed 
great interest in having 
Cantor get involved in the 
project, he said. One has even 
prompted Cantor to start 
working on a screenplay for 
the book. 

"I've been working on 
banging out a screenplay dur- 
ing my spare lime during the 
last couple of weeks," Cantor 
said. "I don't know anything 
about writing screenplays so 
I'm going to need some 
help." 

Definite news on a movie 
deal should be coming any 
day. Cantor said. Bui even 
after the details arc finalized 
it will be a while before ihe 
screen version of "Wheelin' 
on Bcalc" hits the theaters. 

"From what everybody tells 
me about movie making, it is 
a long process," noted 
Cantor. "Even if they pick 
litis thing up right now. the 
actual film could be five 
years down the road." 

Well, Cantor will have plen- 
ty to do while he waiis. 



most likely leftover from a farm 
built on the IPFW property 
before 1962, which is about 
when ihe university was opened. 

"The odorous material has 
been here since then, or before 
1962," Kattcr said. 

However. Kauer said the gas- 
oline tank was never recovered. 
and il is unknown whether or 
not other tanks arc buried 
around campus. 

Gasoline dangerous in 
soil, according to experts 

Dave Campcrman, field su- 
pervisor of the Allen County 
Board of Health, said gasoline 
contamination poses many dif- 
ferent problems. 

Campcrman, who deals in this 
area orien, said dangers involv- 
ing ihc campus depends on the 
volume of spillage and the prod- 
uct dial has been spilled. 

"Gas is made up ol many car- 
cinogenic chemicals. It can be 
potentially dangerous. Once 
one of those products gets into 
your system, or into water sup- 
plies, they can create a serious 
problem." Campcrman said. 



Campcrman said another prob- 
lem could arise because the city 
water intake is jusl downstream 
from where the spill was. 

A third area of concern, said 
Campcrman, is ihat gasoline 
contained lead before 1962. 

Lead content depends on prod- 
uct, Camperman said. Leaded

Student information safe 
on IPFW campus 



By Janet Ausbury 
Staff Writer 

Students who wonder about the 
confidentiality of their records 
at IPFW need not worry, 
according lo Richard Ritchie, 
vice chancellor for financial 
affairs. 

Some sources of student infor- 
mation on campus include 
Police and Safety complaint 
records and IPFW Requests for 
Public Record filed at Ritchie's 
office. 

Ritchie noted that all requests 
for public record go through his 
office, and lhat anyone wishing 
to find out information that is 
public record should send a 
form to his office. 

If an individual goes to IPFW 
departments seeking informa- 
tion that is public record, he or 
she will be referred to Ritchie. 

When a Request for Public 
Record is received, Ritchie for- 
wards it to the department that 
would contain the requested 
information. The department 
sends ihc information lo Ritchie 
and he makes ihe final decision 
to grant, deny, or partially grant 
the request. Denials are 
explained by Ritchie on ihc 
form when he sends it back lo 
the person who requested ihc 
information. 

When a request is denied, said 
Ritchie, it is usually because the 
request is too general. "Do your 
homework ahead of lime," he 
advised. The more specific a 
request is, the quicker Ritchie 
can grant the request. Ritchie 



attempts to provide as much 
requested information as soon 
as possible and notifies people 
on whom public record informa- 
tion is being released. 

If documents are part of the 
normal administrative procedure 
at IPFW and are kept on record. 
anyone has access to them. For 
example, salaries of IPFW 
employees would be available 
because salaries of public insti- 
tutions' employees arc public 
record. Medical records or 
criminal investigation records of 
employees, however, would not 
be considered public informa- 
tion. 

Paul Strouis, interim chief of 
police and director of safety, 
said lhat Police and Safety's 
incident reports are available via 
the Request for Public Record 
process, but the information is 
very general. 

In some cases, names of indi- 
viduals arc blocked out, but the 
description of the incident is 
fully available. Each request for 
information is looked at individ- 
ually. The office provides as 
much information as legally 
possible. As with all Requests 
for Public Record, Ritchie 
makes ihe final decision to grant 
or deny the request. 

Police and Safety, in collabora- 
tion with the state police and 
Purdue-West Lafayeltc, is work- 
ing on a new incident report 
form in which no names will be 
used.

Senate meeting cancelled 
due to low turn out 



By Chad Hesting 
Managing Editor 

The IPFW student senate 
failed to hold two weekly meet- 
ings due to low senator atten- 
dance. 

The March 5 and March 20 
meetings were dissolved when 
an insufficient number of sena- 
tors came to provide a voting 
quorum. Only six senators were 
present at die March 5 meeting 
and seven were present for the 
March 20 meeting. 

According to student senate 
by-laws, half the senate plus one 
must be present to cany official 
business. Informal discussion 
may take place, but no legisla- 
tion may be amended or voted 
on. 

According to John 

Wcisenbcrger. vice president of 
legislation, ihc problem is an 
on-going one. Work and class 
schedules often interfere with 
senate meeting times. 

"There is no reason you can't 
put aside one hour a week for a 
meeting," said Weisenbcrger. 
"They're held on alternating 
Thursdays and Fridays to avoid 
conflict problems." 



However, Wcisenbergcr noted 
that several senators were 
stricken with strep throat for the 
last meeting. Disciplining habit- 
ually absent senators is difficult, 
said Wcisenbcrger. After five 
absences a senator can be 
impeached, but the process is 
too difficult to be worth the 
effort, he said. 

If ihe problem continues, he 
said, "There's nothing I can do 
about if 

Internal affairs committee co- 
chair, Katie Groatrian, is 
responsible for maintaining 
attendance records and notifying 
senators when they arc ncaring 
die five-absence limit. 

According to Groatrian, all 
senators arc given a written 
notice keeping them abreast of 
their attendance record. "A few 
senators have five absences 
now," she said. 

"I feel that as long as there's 
people representing your com- 
mittee there, and if your busi- 
ness is getting done it's OK,' 
she said. 

"But as far as quorum goes," 
Groatrian said, "when we can't 
vote, it's very disappointing.'

IPSGA's difficulties 
need quick attention 



Over the last two years the Indiana Purdue 
Student Government Association has had 
more than its share of problems. 

Cut apart by internal bickering, factional- 
ism, and embarrassing sideshows, IPSGA 
effectiveness fell to a new low. Student inter- 
est in its governing body is, at best, minimal. 
Approximately 3 percent of the IPFW student 
body voted in last year's IPSGA elections. 

However, Elbert Webster, a senator, 
remarked at a recent meeting that he felt that 
the student senate was in a "rebuilding peri- 
od." He is probably right, though the future is 
unwritten. Student senate's "rebuilding peri- 
od" can build the whole IPSGA up, if the 
government is willing to address several key 
problems. 

The Communicator went to the printers 
before the conclusion of the IPSGA elections, 
but these should serve as a wish list for any 
elected officers. 

1 . Attendance rates arc bad. If student sena- 
tors and SAB members aren't gelling to their 
respective meetings, they don't know what's 
going on. If they don't know what's going on, 
they shouldn't be allowed to include that 
experience on their resumes. Get them out. 

The last two student senate meetings 
weren't held, due to the lack of voting quo- 
rum. D?FW students have a right to be repre- 
sented by people who give a damn about 
where their money is being spent. 

2. Similarly, senate committee involvement 
leaves something to be desired. It isn't 
uncommon for committees to go without 
meeting during the course of a week. 
Committee chairs neglect reporting to the full 
senate meeting, if the chairs arc even there at 
all. 

Student business shouldn't be left slack like 
that, not even for a single week's time. 

3. SAB events need overhauled. Students 
aren't getting a real return on their dollar 
here. Attendance at SAB events, such as 
movies, midday diversions and dances are 
very low, and has been for some time. Is the 



message not getting through to SAB? 

It would be far better to spend money on 
fewer, quality events, than lo sprinkle student 
service money around on hypnotists, psy- 
chics, and guys with guitars. 

4. Student leadership should be stronger. 
Student senators had to scramble to form 
some sort of opposition to tuition and fee 
increases this semester, while the executive 
committee treated it as business as usual. 
Applause to the senators for their responsive- 
ness and independence, but those at die top 
could have lent a hand. 

Executive committee members should be 
ready lo speak and listen for IPFW students, 
and not be satisfied with pointing student 
government around. 

5. The student service budgeting process 
needs to be opened up for student involve- 
ment This is the most important point of all. 

The IPSGA handles some $260,000 of stu- 
dent service funds in a year. The budgeting 
process is handled by a five-member budget- 
ing committee, headed by the elected vice 
president of finance. The committee recom- 
mendations are then voted on by the student 
senate for approval, then sent to Frank Borelli 
for adjustments (Borelli is the vice chancellor 
for student affairs). 

A committee of five people is too small a 
group to be doting out that kind of money. 
The group is too prone to stacking, and isn't 
big enough to allow a cross-section of student 
input. Also, Borelli takes far too free a hand 
with the recommendations. Where's the self- 
rcprcseniation in that? 

Also, why aren't budgetary planning meet- 
ings publicized? (They're open to students.) 
Agreed, additional time and effort would 
have to be allowed for increased input and 
response, but that can only help the process. 
not hurt IL 

Addressing these problems will help con- 
vince students that the government cares 
about its affairs. No matter who is elected this 
week, it is the least they can do. 



WHO head speaks out 



To the Editor: 

As the executive director of Fort Wayne 
Women's Health Organization, I fee! compelled 
to respond to the letter of Feb. 20 written by 
Amy Rutin. To be blunt, Ms, Ruian's letter 
contains all of the inaccuracies, distortions, and 
"libelous omissions" found in die anti-abortion 
literature passed out in front of women's clinics 
across the country. 

By simply omitting pertinent facts, anti-abor- 
tionists strive to frighten and misinform women 
who ovail themselves of abortion services. The 
strategy appears to be; if you can't tell the truth, 
to throw enough distortion at them to scare 
them. Women are smarter ihan this, and are cer- 
tainly able to obtain the truth by asking simple 
questions. 

1) Docs the doctor have a license to practice 
medicine in the stale? 

Dr. Klopfer is a licensed Doctor of 
Osteopathy in the Slate of Indiana and has been 
since 1978. Ms. Ruian's inference is thai since 
he is not an M-D . he is nol a physician. This is 
a lie by omission, D.O.'s have been practicing 
medicine in Indiana since the lum of the centu- 
ry- 

The Chicago School of Osteopathy was estab- 
lished in 1897, and D.O.'s from thai school 
have practiced medicine successfully in the 
Midwest since ihcn. There arc many D.O.'s 
practicing in the Fort Wayne area, including, by 
information in a receni advertisement in the 
Ncws-Seniincl, five D.O.'s on siaff at Saint 
Joseph's Hospital. 

I am sure that Ms. Ruian's inference lhat 
D.O.'s are somehow nol real doctors would be 
as offensive to those D.O.'s as it is to Dr. 
Klopfer. 

2) Are there lawsuits againsi Dr. Klopfer? 

Dr. Klopfer has no malpractice lawsuits pend- 
ing against him. Ms. Rutan refers lo the fact that 
physicians performing abortions arc being sued 
for malpractice. I might note lhal malpractice 
suits are being filed against physicians in all 
specialties. Abortions arc ihc most commonly 
performed surgery in the U.S. at the present 
time. The complication rale is lower than for ob 
and delivery care. 

3) Do clinics obtain an informed consent from 
women before ihc abortion procedure? 

Once again, Ms. Rutan is espousing half-true 
information. Just because stales don't always 



require informed consent does nol mean lhal 

physicians don't obioin them. Physicians don't 
practice good medicine because the law requires 
them lo; they practice good medicine because 
they are trained lo. FWWHO requires an 
informed conseni from each palieni before the 
abortion procedure. It is extremely detailed, and 
lists all of the possible complications of the 
abortion procedure. Once again, the truih is 
quite differeni for Ms. Ruian's rhetoric. 
4) Are there psychological effects from abor- 

Thc on ti -abortionists attempted to gel a nation- 
al study in 1987-88 sanctioned by Dr. C. Everett 
Koop, then Surgeon General of .ihc United 
Stales (and a leading anti-abortionisi), thai 
would prove iheir thesis dial abortion is psycho- 
logically harmful to women. Much lo iheir con- 
sternation, Dr. Koop announced lhal aficr much 
study by his committee, there was no conclusive 
evidence lhal there was any psychological harm 
to women aficr abortion. 

Women who make a decision to have an abor- 
tion have the right lo have as much information 
as possible before they make their decision. In 
fact, patients undergoing any medical treatment 
have a right to as much information as possible. 
Responsible health care providers have on oblig- 
ation to provide this information. We at 
FWWHO arc nol afraid of the truih, and wel- 
come any questions from patients and their fam- 
ilies. We have provided quality health care ser- 
vices in Fort Wayne since 1978, and we are all 
proud of our services. The FWWHO staff and 
physician have continued to be professional and 
lo provide excellent services, even when ihc 
clinic has been blockaded, burned, attacked and 
vandalized. 

People opposed to abortion have every right to 
oppose it. They have the opportunity to provide 
alternatives, not on die streets, invading Fort 
Wayne citizens' rights of privacy, but in provid- 
ing supporlive services lo women choosing 
oihcr alternatives. We only hope lhat ihcy arc as 
careful in choosing licensed excellent physicians 
and medical staff as we arc. Women deserve Ihc 
bcsl professionals lhat cither group has lo offer.

IN DiANA- P0Rt&gt;UE STAJDENST S OVERWENT ASSOC, 



Faculty rep asks: return harassment clause 



To the Editor: 

On March 20. 1992. the 
Purdue Board of Trustees met at 
IPFW. I was asked to address 
the board regarding faculty con- 
cerns. I consider it obligatory, 
on my behalf, to make wider 
notice of my remarks. My posi- 
tion as presiding officer of the 
faculty senate is not intended to 
be a spokesperson for all facul- 
ty. However, once given the 
opportunity, I am not noted for 
being reticent to engage in pub- 
lic speaking. I can only hope 
that I have been faithful to the 
concerns of my colleagues in 
this matter. 

The following is ihe complete 
text of my remarks before the 
board: 

I am Bill Frederick, associate 
professor of computer science 
and presiding officer of the 
Indiana-Purdue Fort Wayne fac- 
ulty senate, which consists of 
both Indiana and Purdue faculty 
members. I have been asked on 
this occasion to represent 
Indiana and Purdue constituen- 
cies. There are two speakers, 



Mike Downs for the Indiana fac- 
ulty and Art Finco for the 
Purdue faculty. Afier consulta- 
tion with both speakers they 
agreed thai I address the board 
today. 

I do feel compelled to add that 
Chancellor Lantz, who suggest- 
ed I address you, may not real- 
ize the extent of her wisdom. I 
have a Bachelor of Arts from 
Indiana (Bloomington), a Master 
of Science from IPFW (Fort 
Wayne) and a Ph.D. from 
Purdue (West Lafayette). Not 
only do I represent faculty con- 
stituents, I consider myself an 
alumnus of, a loyalist to and 
someone conversant in the 
philosophies of all three institu- 
tions. It is within this context 
that 1 address the following con- 
Any university is a delicate 
intellectual ecosystem. Concern 
for environmental consequences 
(in this metaphorical setting or 
otherwise) now pervades global, 
national, state and local politics. 
As an observer of local ecology, 
I find pan of lhat natural univer- 



sity balance in peril, due to an 
amendment of our Student Code 
of Conducl. Prima facie, 
removal of protection from 
harassment based on sexual ori- 
entation seems a minor matter in 
the larger scheme of university 
well-being. Allow me to elabo- 
rate, metaphorically. 

We, as IPFW faculty, staff and 
administration have evolved and 
adapted a local balance in 
response to evolutionary pres- 
sures and a population growth 
currently to about 12,000 stu- 
denis. While slate law may not 
identify sexual orientation as a 
protected status, you must 
appreciate our commitment to 
serving our northeast Indiana 
community. 

If we leam nothing else from 
our biological lessons, small, 
seemingly insignificant pertur- 
bations in local ecosystems have 
been known to upset very large 
powerful forces. Consider snail 
darters and hydroelectric dam 
builders, logging interests and 
spotted owls. As local ccolo- 
gists, we feel compelled to warn 



you aboui the consequences of 
the Sludenl Code changes. The 
IPFW faculty senate removed 
its endorsement of the code. 
Students' government removed 
endorsement of the offending 
sections. 

IPFW faculty asks lhat you 
reconsider your decision to 
remove the phrase. It is a vital 
local issue. The IPFW faculty 
senate will not be party to any 
adverse interpretations that our 
students, staff and local commu- 
nity will make of the deletion. 
We see it as a threat to the eco- 
logical intellectual local balance 
we have worked so carefully 
over the past 25 years to main- 
tain. Please reconsider your 
actions. 

Thank you for time and 
patience. The opportunity to 
meet and address the Board of 
Trustees of my Alma Mater has 
been a privilege and pleasure I 
will not soon forget. 

Bill Frederick 
IPFW Professor 



This university's income not being spent well 



To the Editor: 
To my former associates in 

students' government, I applaud 
your concern for, and attention 
to, escalating costs associated 
with attending this university. 
However, it is not the increased 
dollars that we should be con- 
cerned with, it is where those 
dollars are being spent 



I have no objection to paying 
increased costs if the result is 
improved academic resources or 
to reward existing faculty and to 
attract additional faculty. I do 
strongly object to my dollars 
(increased or otherwise) being 
spent on an unconscionably 
bloated and burgeoning admin- 
istration (compare administra- 
tive to faculty ratios from 1969 



to present) or on such non-acad- 
emic programs such as "well- 
ness" arid other such "I'm OK, 
You're OK" pop-psych pro- 
grams which should have been 
buried with tie-dyes and love- 
beads. 

How many professors could be 
hired; how many books could be 
purchased; or how many new 



courses could be offered with 
the dollars spent on a physical 
education facility that offers no 
education as but one example of 
this university's loss of focus on 
its primary purpose? These are 
the questions for which we 
should demand answers.

THE COMMUNICATOR 



Soil contamination 



continued from page 1 

gasoline contained several thousand 
limes more lead than the normal levct. 

Another problem. Campcrman said, 
is that any heat source near the conta- 
minated soil could cause an explosion. 

Tom Eshcoff, special waste consul- 
tant at Waste Management, said the 
gasoline would have contained such a 
small amount il wouldn't matter. 

Eshcoff said when hazardous spills 
are discovered, the area is examined. 
He said it is tested for petroleum con- 
tent, hydrocarbons, and flash-point, 
the lowest temperature at which 
vapors ignite in air when exposed to 
flame. 

Although he was not familiar with 
the specific case, Eshcoff said the 
IPF\V soil probably wasn't very haz- 
ardous because "most aren't" 

"Gasoline is not toxic. It is not that 
bad. We're around it constantly and it 
is not life-threatening," Eshcoff added. 



Even though gasoline is not a highly 
toxic chemical, Campcrman said there 
arc many disposal steps that arc 
required by law. 

The entire area needs to be dug up 
and mapped off, Campcrman said. 
The contaminated dirt then is hauled 
away to a state-monitored landfill. 

Campcrman said that methods of dis- 
posal arc generally very expensive. 
"It all depends on space availability at 
the landfills, disposal, treatment, and 
transportation." 

After the soil is removed, 
Campcrman said the testing continues 
until the Indiana Department of 
Environmental Management deems 
testing no longer necessary. 

Campcrman explained that most 
spills in this area can be dealt with 
fairly easily. "We have heavier soil 
than most areas, so leakage doesn't 
migrate as much, even if it gels loose. 
But it depends on the geology of the 
area."

recent campus event Photo by Jim Walker. 



Although Kattcr said he decided that 

the gasoline leak was not dangerous at 
IPFW. the Indiana Department of 
Environmental Management agreed 
with Campcrman by saying it was a 
hazardous situation. 

At press time, IDEM had not found 
the files involving IPFW and had no 
knowledge of the case. 

Information 



continued from page 1 

Names of people involved in the 
complaint will be attached to the form, 
so if a copy of an incident report is 
requested a copy will be provided 
without the names attached. 

Additionally, people requesting inci- 
dent reports will need to provide as 
much information about the incident 
as possible. They will no longer be 
able to request these reports by the 
name of the person the complaint was 
filed against. 

Strouts feels this form will be an 
improvement because it will make the 
information available without jeopar- 
dizing anyone's privacy or reputation. 
"A complaint is not a conviction, " he 
stressed. 

Although the possibility exists that 
student data could be improperly 
obtained and used, Ritchie and Strouts 
noted that they have received no com- 
plaints of this nature. Of the two com- 
plaints the registrar's office received, 
the most recent incident occurred 
approximately a year ago. - 

Grcenbcrg emphasized that the uni- 
versity is sensitive "to the need for 
maintaining students' privacy and 
added that any questions or complaints 
should be brought to his attention. "If 
something goes awry, rest assured we 
will pursue it"

What does a guy have to do to get a drink? 



By Chad Hestiog 
Managing Editor 

You'd be surprised ai how much 
trouble u is io get a drink in this town, 
dear reader. My girlfriend and I had a 
hell of a time not long ago. 

Yes, that's right. Trouble, right here 
in Three Rivers City. I know that 
seems strange, because the Fort is a 
veritable Liq-O-Rama. There's bars 
everywhere. 

Why, five minutes from campus. 
Shorty's serves the most honest shots 
in town, and he didn't even pay me to 
say that. The bars on the Landing 
downtown house the mousse-and- 
Grcy Flannel set on weekends. 

Just north of IPFW lies Our Pierre 
Brubakcr O'Toolc's Snicker 
Connection Place, the multinational 
pub conglomerate controlled by Kevin 
Ferguson. Ever sec Ferguson do his I- 
wish-I-was-Lcltcrman shtkk on the 
"Night Shift" show? You're right, 1 
didn't like it, either. 

Forget that, though. Me and my 
honey had to go dry one Thursday 
evening. 

The aforementioned honey's name is 
Donna. She lives in Indy, and we'd 
done some long-distance dating. I'd 
invited her to Fort Wayne to show her 
what a.cosmopolitan Utile town we've 
got here. ("Our mall is huge, Donna. 
Honest! ") 

I look tier first to , a down- 
town fern bar. (Pardon me for not 
using their name, but our advertising 



manager still thinks she can get an 
account with them. She guards her turf 
like a wolverine.) The maitrc d" 
squinted at us when wc got through 
the door. "Hclloooo..." he hissed, "I'm 
Cameron, and I'll be seating you 
tonight. Walk this way." 

He gave us our menus and said, 
"Julia will be your wailron tonight, 
and Jason will be your bartender 
tonight." 

"I'm Chad," I said, "and I'll be pay- 
ing you tonight." 

That was the last we saw of 
Cameron, who seated us that night. 
Julia, who would have been serving us 
that night, never showed. Donna, who 
was my date that night, had to go to 
the bar to get a glass of wine. 

"The service here sucks. Let's pay 
and go somewhere else," Donna said. 

"Okay, but wc ought to leave a tip." I 
replied. 

Donna wrote "When G.E. gels to 75 
1/2 points, buy" on an envelope, and 
wc split. 

Wc went down the street to . 

(another ad account) my favorite 
drinkcry. "Everyone knows me here." 
I assured her as we slid into a booth. 
As I was kissing her hand, my favorite 
waitress got to the table. 

"Hey, how ya doin'?" 

She fixed me with a hard stare and 
smacked two glasses of ice water on 
the table. 

Damn, what was going on tonight? 

"Um... glass of scotch and a spinach 



salad, please." I wasn't under age, but 
she was making me feel like it. 

She gave Donna an equally icy glare. 
"Wine, please." was all she could 
whisper. 

The waitress left us, and wc put our 
heads together. 

"What's her problem?" Donna 
asked. 

"Hell, I don't know. She knows who 
I am. I come here all the time." I 

grabbed

PG-13 because Jessica Tandy does a 
shower scene. Two stars - •*. 

"Gladiator" - This is the movie 
about Gemini. Nitro, Ice and the other 
American Gladiators. I don't want to 
give away the ending, but Lace dies in 
a terrible jousting accident. Ten stars - 



'The Lawnmowcr Man" - This is a 
low-budget sequel to "Edward 
Scissorhands." Howie Mandell plays a

QUOTE OF THE WEEK - "Do 
one thing, and do it better than any- 
one," Orville Rcdcnbachcr. 



After wc got our food, wc never saw 
her again. We tipped her three pen- 
nies, then left. 

We decided to get a room for the 
night, so as not to wake my room- 
mates with the evening's gruntin' and 

groanin'. We stopped at , an 

area bed-and-breakfasi. Donna ran in 
to check on rooms while I waited in 
the car. 

Two minutes hadn't passed before 
she was at the door, waving at me to 
come in. Inside, Donna was standing 
with her arms crossed. The proprietor, 
pale as he was, got paler when I 
stepped in. Beads of sweat clung to his 
pencil mustache. 

"You tell Chad what you just told 
me," Donna snapped. 

"Well, ah, I was telling your, ah, 
friend here that wc don't have any 
rooms available tonight. We're all 
booked up." he stammered, "Business 
is good, hch, hch." 

'There's no cars in the lot," I replied. 

"They're not here yet. We've, ah, 
booked that team that's playing the 
Komets." 

"Hockey players, eh?" I said. 
"Bummer, having all those drunken 
Canucks wandering around your love- 
ly place, making a mess of things. 
Wouldn't you rather give a room to a 
nice quiet couple?" 



"Well, reservations arc reservations, 
you know," he croaked. 

"That's enough!" yelled Donna. 
"I'm getting out of here." 

Wc stalked out into the parking lot. 
"The hell with that guy. Let's go down 
to..." 

"No, you didn't hear mc." said 
Donna, "I'm getting out of here. Out 
of town. I'm going down to Indy. 
They serve us colored folk drinks 
down there." 

Oh, sorry. Did I mention that 
Donna's black? 

I'm not, in case you didn't notice. 
It's the only reason I can figure for the 
poor treatment. Wc didn't smell bad, 
or grope each other in these places, or 
wear swastikas or anything like that. 
Our skins weren't really worthy of 
mention, but maybe I should have 
anyway. 

Regardless, she left mc in a cloud of 
exhaust, and headed down 1-69. 

I decided to drown my sorrows in an 
establishment down the street. A place 
where nobody gave a damn who you 
were holding hands with when you 
went in. 

With "Over 80 Billion Served." they 
had to have served everyone there, 
right? 




Letter to Leisure 

Writer says save 70 f s 



Letter to Leisure: 

-Last year I sal on my bed and just encd. I buried my head in my hands 
and just wailed. I let it all come out. Years of emotional anguish and tur- 
moil balled up inside of mc just came flooding ouL My wife approached 
me and attempted to comfort mc, but even she could provide no solace. 

When she questioned me about my misery, I dried my eyes and 
screamed. "THE 70s ARE GONE AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU OR 
ANYBODY CAN DO ABOUT IT!" Then I flung myself onto the bed 
again, covered my head with the pillows, and continued sobbing. 

It all started last year when my spouse and I ventured to the mall. Wc 
sauntered into the women's section of a department store looking for o pair 
of black pumps. 

It was then when I saw them. The most primitive, gaudy, unattractive 
pair of clogs, yes, the wooden and leather heels from when America was in 
its fashion greatness. "Look!" I yelled to my wife across an elderly woman 
looking at nursing shoes. "Clogs! Yes! Praise the heavens it's a clog!" 

As 1 lay rolling on the ground in ecsiasy, people started to gather around. 
"Look, look!" I told them as I held the shoe before me as if it were to be 
worshipped. 

"It's a clog. It's a clog. Remember the 70s? You know John Travolta, the 
Bee Gees, Kool and the Gang?" I asked them. But nobody's expression 
changed. All I got was a crowd of blank stares. 

My wife stepped over and put her arm around me. My eyes were glossy 
and my skin was cold and clammy. She took the clog out of my hand and 
placed it back on the display cabinet. Then the crowd parted and we began 
walking down the aisle. One lady stepped forward and asked if she should 
call an ambulance. 

My wife nodded and said no. "This happens quite often. All I need io do 
is get him home and put the "Grease" soundtrack on," she said. "He'll be 
okay. He's just had another 70s seizure." 

So that brings us back to the beginning of this story. Wc returned home 
from the mall and as my wife unpacked her "midnight black" pumps and 
threw them into the closet, I began to sob. You know the rest of the story. 

A year has passed now and I find myself able to cope sufficiently with 
my love for die 70s. Oh sure, I sometimes listen to Barry Manilow and 
K.C. and the Sunshine Band, but I'm sure everybody else docs too. 

It just makes mc sad. I wish everybody loved the 70s as much as me. My 
wife says that I'm the only person in the world who does. I hope that's not 
true. I believe somewhere out there there's others like myself who still 
leave their shirts unbuttoned half-way and wear fake gold necklaces. 

I know that others still enjoy wearing bell-bottom jump suits that fit real 
tight in the butt. I know that many of you still love disco as much as I do 
and that you also feel a real loss because no one can sing those high notes 
in "Jive Talkin'" like the Bee Gees. 

Yes. I know others out there, like me, are feeling alone and helpless in 
this world where polyester pants no longer provide the wearer the social 
status they once did. 

I just wanted those people to know that I may be here in the 90s but I'll 
always be living in the 70s.

'Backtrack' offers killer cast; 
not just low-budget sleeper 



By Jim Walker 
Editor in Chief 
It seems that Dennis Hopper's 
drugs have had a lasting effect. 

And that's not all bad in this 
case. 

Hopper, who nearly ruined his 
career because of a drug 



Review 



problem, directs and stars in 
"Backtrack" which is just out 
on video. 

The Vestron Pictures fdm was 
finished in 1989. But 
"Backtrack," which Dick Clark 
produced, was never released in 
theaters. 

It probably never hit the 
cinema-plexes because some 
Hollywood movie execs 
thought nobody would go see it. 
They probably thought it was 
too weird. 

But movie execs funded 
"Ishtar." They backed "Hudson 
Hawk" and "Heaven's Gate." 

What the hell do they know? 

"Backtrack" is a great movie. 
Sure it's really odd at times, but 
who says movies have to be 
formed from cookie cutters? 

"Backtrack" isn't just some 
low-budget sleeper. It features a 
killer cast. Jodie Foster stars as 
an LED sign artist who 
witnesses a mob murder. She 
identifies the killer but refuses 
to enter a witness protection 
program offered by a cop, 
played by Fred Ward. 

Instead Foster's character hits 
the road and ends up in some 
odd places. 

While Ward hunts for his 
witness, the mob hires hit man 
Dennis Hopper to find Foster 
and kill her. 

The interesting crew of 
mobsters includes Joe Pesci as 
the boss and John Turturo and 
Anthony Sirico as his thugs. 
Dean Stockwell plays the 
mobster's lawyer. 

Eventually, the Hopper hit 
man character uses all of his 
powers of deduction to find 
Foster in a tiny desert town. 

Then the movie takes off.

I Jf_ ooe bdiroom apartment Vciy a 
EujV«J&gt; nod clean. First floor. 

... Jjj\ , Private entrance 

V»J?S 3 S275.O0 UtUitia included 




Instead of killing her, the hit 
man becomes infatuated with 
Foster. 

He doesn't kill her. Instead, 
the obsessed hit man lets her 
live only if she promises to 
belong to him. At gunpoint she 
agrees. Then he takes her with 
him to hide, because he too is 
now being hunted by the mob 
and the police. 

The evolution of this love 
story between the hit man and 
who he was supposed to hit is 
wildly original. 

It's easy to understand how the 
hit man could fall for Foster in 
this movie. She is beyond 
beautiful on film in 
"Backtrack." 

We literally see another side of 
Foster in this movie, as she does 
her first nude scene. She takes a 
shower. 

Besides Foster, there's a lot of 
beauty in "Backtrack." Much of 
the film is shot in New Mexico 
desert country, complete with 
high, blue skies and smooth, tan 
sand. 

But "Backtrack's" real beauty 
is found in the entire package. 
Hopper offers up interesting and 
eccentric characters, sharp 
dialogue, neat scenes, 
interesting romance and well- 
placed action. 

It's also fun to see who pops 
up in "Backtrack." Charlie 
Sheen plays Foster's short lived 
boyfriend, Bob. And Bob Dylan 
does a bit part as a chain saw 
artist. 

Hopper's film vision in 
"Backtrack" is along the lines 
of Johnathan Demme's in 
"Married to the Mob," and 
"Something Wild." 

"Backtrack" also brings to 
mind the work of David Lynch, 
especially "Blue Velvet," in 
which Hopper played a 
deranged nitrous oxide addict. 

"Backtrack" is manna from 
heaven for movie fans starving 
for something sharp, offbeat, 
and original.

Volleydons beat Rutgers 
for Coach Ball's 200th win 



By Joe Heersche 
Sports Editor 

Arnic Ball, coach of IPFWs 
volleyball leant, hit a career milestone 
on Saturday as he led the Volleydons 
to victory. 

With this win over Rutgers -Newark, 
Ball became only the eighth NCAA 
volleyball coach to win 200 matches. 
Ball accomplished this Teat in just 12 
seasons, averaging 17 wins per season. 

"Obviously this is a thrill for mc. 
The credit really goes to the kids. 
They're a lot of fun and they are 
quality kids," said Ball. The victory 
was even more satisfying for IPFW 
because it came from sixth-ranked 
Rutgcrs-Ncwark who has beaten 
IPFW in three previous matches this 
season. 

Ruigcr's coach, Bob Bcrtucci, is also 
one of the seven other coaches who 
have reached the 200 win milestone. 

The almost-at-home match was 
played at Carroll High School due to 
scheduling conflicts with a local 
science fair taking place in the IPFW 
Athletic Center. When it started the 
match looked as if Ball would have to 
wail until the NCAA loumamcni lo 
beat Rutgers-Newark. Rutgers took 
the first game 15-11. 

Freshman Felipe Ralat and junior 
Qucntin Spiegel came off the bench 
for the Volleydons in game two to add 
height to the line up. Ralat at f&gt;feet-6- 
inches and Spiegel at 6-fect-7-inchcs 
forced Rutgers to hit around the front 
line defense of the Volleydons, and 
the two were able to hit over ihc 
shorter blockers of Rutgers. For the 
match IPFW was able to hit nearly 40 
percent, while allowing Rutgers to hit 
only 25 percent. Ratal and Spiegel 



each contributed II kills with only 
three hilling errors. 

IPFW won game two 15-9 wilh the 
added height, and then games three 
and four with 15-7 and 15-2 victories. 

Raul Papaleo led IPFW with 14 kills, 
followed by Norman Almodovar wilh 
13. and Craig Collins added 12. Lloy 
Ball added 67 of IPFWs 71 assists in 
the win. Jeff Wcniworth and Ihor 
Akinshyn led all hitlers in the match 
with 1 7 in ihc losing effort 

The win increased the Volleydons 
overall record to 19-6. In national 
rankings released Tuesday. IPFW 
moved up one spot to No. 6. replacing 
Rutgers-Newark. Rutgcrs-Ncwark 
dropped inlo a tic wilh U.C.-Santa 
Barbara for seventh. 

Coach Ball's 199th win came against 
Midwest Intercollegiate Volleyball 
Association rival Ball State at Muncie 
on Friday. 

The Volleydons needed five games 

10 beat the 16lh ranked Cardinals 15-6, 
15-11, 7-15, 9-15, and 15-8. IPFW has 
now won seven straight matches 
againsi Ball State, five of which have 
been in Muncie. 

The Cardinals made a run for ihc win 
defeating the Volleydons in games 
three and four behind Paul Nikiforov's 
strong performance coming off the

Experience key for tennis team 



By Joe Heersche 
Sports Editor 

Many coaches who looked at their 
roslcrs and saw only one junior and 
ihc rest freshman and sophomore 
players would consider trie year a 
rebuilding year. But not Dan Brogan, 
coach of the men's tennis team. 

Brogan believes this year's icam has 
more experience than any of the 
previous six he has coached. 

One of the reasons for his optimism 
is (he return of Bob Strombcck who 
was the No. 1 player in the 1990 
season. Also, Randy Stewart, the 
current No. 4 player, returns after a 
two year hialus from ihc icam. 

"This year's team is improved at 
every position," said Brogan. 

Another two players return (torn lasi 
season's squad, John Brock, the No. 5 
singles player, and Rod Valentine, the 
No. 6 singles player. 

Scott Winling and Dave Krahn 
round out the roster as the No. 2 and 
No. 3 players. 

Adding to Brogan's optimism over 
his squad's experience is Ihc depth of 
die team. The No. 7 and No. 8 singles 
players, Chris Shidler and Jerry Smith, 
were all-conference players in high 
school last season, 

Brogan's optimism is backed by 
strong play already this season. The 
squad has jumped lo a 3-0 record wilh 
two wins in conference play. 

In IPFW's first match against Siena 
Heighis lhe Mastodons dominated by 
a score of 7-2. The second maich was 
more of the same as they blanked 
Kentucky Stale 9-0 in their first 
conference win. 

IPFW then faced Bcllarminc, a team

they have never bcaien. After singles 
play was completed the match stood al 
3-3, and three doubles matches 
remained. In the third and final 
doubles play, IPFW's learn, consisting 
of Stewart and Brock, was down five 
games to two. staging a furious 
comeback Sicwart and Brock were 
able lo win 7-6 and 7-5 lo win the 
maich for IPFW by a score of 5-4. 

"Bcllarmine was a great win. It 
gives us confidence and momentum,' 
said Brogan. 

Brogan would like lo sec ihc icam 
finish at least in the lop three of ihc 
conference. IPFW will be tested this 
weekend when ihcy face Northern 
Kentucky University and Indianapolis 
University, both arc expected lo vie 
for the conference championship.
