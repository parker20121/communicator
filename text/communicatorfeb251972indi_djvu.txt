Abortion article sparks 
readers' opinions 

Mark Souder: 

Your coliimn is aptly 
titled. People, moral 
Btandords, the world It- 
self Is Judged as you see 
It. The trouble la that 
you don't aeem to see very 
much. Your most recent 
article discussed abortion: 
■The principle involved is 
the killing of an Innocent 
human being becauae his 
existence Is Inconvenient 
or uncomfortable to others." 
Ts It? The principle be- 
comes a little more com- 
plex when one considers the 
Impact of birth defects and 
mental retardation, lllegltl- 
"•acy, rape and overpopula- 
tion. Have you seriously 
considered these Issues, 
much less personally ex- 
perienced them? Have you 
ever found yourself preg- 
nant? 

I respect your concern 
for human life. I despise 



the presumptuous applica- 
tions of your smug, self- 
righteous generalizations 
and judgements to people 
to whom the problems of 
birth control and abortion 
and draft resistance and 
"Christianity", among others, 
are quite real--not just 
controversial newspaper 
copy. 

You are a man, and a 
very young one in many 
ways. Until you become 
capable of bearing a child, 
and capable of experiencing 
the responslbiUtios of 
child-bearing, I view with 
contempt your suitability 
to judge the ethics of 
abortion. 

I realize that we will 
all be subject to your 
weekly Ideology. Please, 
in response to the com- 
ments you are sure to re- 
ceive on this topic, spare 
us the Inane assumptions 
and "humorous" references 
about liberated females. 
That's something else you 
probably don't know anything 
about. 

--Harcla Schmidt 
Mr. Souder, 

When you can assure each 
child that he Is born Into a 
world free from war, that he 
is guaranteed adequate food, 
health care, and housing, and 
that he la wanted and loved, 
then you may call your mor- 
ality Christian. Until then, 
however, what you are sup- 
porting is murder--prolonged, 
perhaps, until the child le

— Lyn Stangland 
Dear Editor: 

I would like to sug- 
gest some other, perhaps 
less colorful, ways of 
looking at the problem of 
terminating pregnancies 
than were presented In the 
last Issue of the COMMUNI- 
CATOR. If the views pre- 
sented were only those of 
a single Individual, it 
would not be useful to re- 
spond. However Indiana 
does not permit the termi- 
nation of a pregnancy, nor 
counseling with regard to 
ending a pregnnncy In 
another state. Are these 
laws rational? 

First, what about the 
child? It Is estimated that 
35-45% of the population of 
the United States consists 
of unwanted births (Prince- 
ton Office of Population 
Research). Uhlle not all 
unwanted babies are un- 
loved babiea, there Is a 
definite correlation be- 
tween an unwanted preg- 
nancy and a child that la 
subsequently abused or bat- 
tered (Helper, 1968). 

On a less extreme level, 
It Is those parents who 
were not desirous of having 
children who do not show 
the normal development of 
attachment to the infant 
(Robson and Moss, 1969). 

Motherhood, unlike en- 
gagement, marriage, or a 
career decision, la not re- 
versible. Ue place the 
burden to socialize the 
child largely, and often 
completely, on the mother, 



but we in Indiana do not 
grant her the possibility 
of making s choice about 
motherhood. 

It 1b irresponsible to 
bear an unwanted child, but 
women are forced into that 
irresponsibility. I would 
much prefer that every child 
be a wanted child. For the 
sake of the child, I am not 
in favor of compulsory 
pregnancies. . . 

Why do I speak o£ com- 
pulsory pregngncies rather 
than of abortion? Largely 
to call attention to the 
fact that few individuals 
are considering what the 
real alternatives are for 
the woman. Whether or not 
the nother choses to give 
the child up for adoption 
at birth, the basic alter- 
natives available to a 
pregnant woman who does not 
want a child are abortion or 
compulsory pregnancy. 

No matter what the wishes 
of the parents are, the law 
does not allow the preg- 
nancy to be terminated, Is

The People Speak... on abortion 

Overcrowded vs. Overpopulated 



by Hike Pfundsteln 
Aak any person who advo- 
cfltea feticide why he be- 
lieves abortion Is desir- 
able, and he will generally 
give one of three arguments 
to uphold his stance. 

First Is the extremely 
relevant argument that abor- 
tion la necessary in order 
to insure the sexual "free- 
dom" of today's men and 
women. 

On the other hand, he may 
have a twinge of righteous- 
ness (or Hltlerlsm) and pro- 
claim that abortion is 
necessary in order to con- 
trol the (luality of human 
life. If we listen to 
him we find that abortion 
is a perfect method for 
eliminating those guilty 
of such crimes as being 
physically handicapped, 
mentally retarded, too poor, 
OF too disadvantaged (all 
of which would lead to 
weakening the master race). 
Along somewhat the same 
line arises the third rea- 
son for abortion: birth 
control. If one listens 
to some alarmist environ- 
mentalists, by the year 
2126, 2500, 2972, or 3500, 
(pick one) we will be up 
to our elbows in Chinamen 
and other assorted people. 
Naturally the only way to 
avoid the Impending doom 
Is to decrease the popula- 
tion growth, and what 
better way is there to stop 
this growth than killing 
people before they are bom? 
By stretching one's Imagin- 
Btlon, guUIblllCy, and 
morals, it Is conceiveable 
that such a conclusion 
could remedy Che problem. 
However, for every en- 
vironmentalist or statis- 
tician who proclaims that 
we are overpopulated there is 
another, as equally qualified, 
who will gladly quote facts 
and figures showing that 
overpopulation la a myth. 
These men would be the first 
to agree that in many places 
in the world today there 
are too many people living 
in too small of an ares, 
causing many problems, the 
more serious of which Is 
pollution. But to declare 
that the pollution prob- 
lem Is based solely upon the 
principle of too many people 
is absurd. 

The pollution problem, 
particularly In the United 
States, arises from the 
fact that people are over - 
crowded , not overpopulated 
in some areas, and they 
refuse to use the techno- 
logy which brought them 
together in order to solve 
the problem of pollution. 

February 25, 1972 



In the United States, as 
of the 1970 census, more than 
fifty* per cent of the peo- 
ple are crowded Into one and 
one half per cent of the 
land. FroK 1950 to 1960 
over one half of the counttea 
in the United States lost 
population. Everyone Is 
crowding Into our urban 
centers csusing^erious con- 
sequences; however, we are 
not overpopulated. 

In fact, according to Dr, 
Karl Brandt of Stanford 
University, the United States 
could easily support a popu- 
lation of 350 million. Our 
land area is so great that 
the entire population of 
the world could be put in 



the U.S. with six people 
for every four acres. 

All of the state of 
Ethode Island could hold 
the world population giving 
everyone three square feet. 
Clearly, our problem la 
one of concentration, not 
.population. 

While the above facts 
would tend to show that our 
population probleTT la not 
as serious as some would 
like us CO believe, no one 
will deny that pollution 
is posing real challenges 
to society. Couldn't these 
challenges be better met by 
concentrating our techno- 
logy and energlea toward 
solving the problem Itself 
rather than finding a Judas 
goat in our unborn? 



A Modest Proposal 



by Stan Jones 

With all the by roar of 
the crowds drowning out 
rational debate on the issue 
of abortion, I would like to 
offer a possible alternative 
to abortion. You have al- 
ready heard and read about 
many of the proa and cons 
on the issue, and maybe you 
have already formed your 
own conclusions; however, 
I may be able to alleviate 
some tension on both sides 
of the debate, 

I suggest to you that a 
possible alternative to 
abortions may be through 
the community adoption 
agencies. We can solve the 
problem of the unwanted child 
by the mother placing it in 
the adoption agency. 

We solve the problem of 
the moralist who feels that 
abortions are Immoral by 
this same procedure. Also, 
it would benefit a third 
party, those who adopt the 
child. 

It seems, however, that 
this solution is not 
readily adhered to. In an 
article by Dell Ford in 
the Feb, 23, 1972 copy of 
the Journal Gazette titled, 
"Prospects Dim for Those 
Seeking Infants," Miss 
Ford relates to us facts 
concerning the adoption 
agencies in our county.. 
The overriding concern of 
all caseworkers in the 
agencies was Che lack of 
babies available for adop- 
tion. 

Some waitln'lg lists are 
reaching from one and one- 
half to two years. The 
question is why the lack of 
available Infants? 

One caseworker summed up 
the situation by this "... 
legalized abortion; more 



wldeapread use and accep- 
tance of contraceptives — 
especially the pill; more 
widespread acceptance of 
the unwed mother." If the 
abortions that are performed 
were to cease and the 
children placed in these 
agenclea, we could, as stated 
before, alleviate much of 
the controversy, 

A friend of mine once 
said to me that if the wo- 
men who had placed their 
babies in the adoption 
agencies had not, he and his 
wife would not have any 
children. Today they have 
two fine boys, one six, the 
other four, both adopted. 
He snd his wife are incap- 
able of having their own 
children. 

It seems to me that It 
would require a certain 
callousness toward life not 
to see this alternative as 
better than continually 
running to the hospital 
and pickling a kid. Also, 
this alternative could be 
embraced by the moralists 
without losing the principles 
chey espouse. 

Abortion article... 

CONTIHUED FROM PAGE TWO 
this not a form of involun- 
tary servitude? I believe 
chat Che termination of 
pregnancy should be a 
choice available for Che 
pregnant woman, according 
to her personal and relig- 
ious dictates. 

Women should have the 
right to control their own 
bodies, to decide whether 
or not to use contraception, 
to decide whether or not 
they want an abortion, Co de- 
cide whether or not they 
wish Co have babies. Since 



COHt'D PROM PRECEDING COLUMN 
women do not participate in 
our courts of law or our 
seaCs of democracy, they 
have not been involved in 
the decisions which affect 
their private lives. Women 
should have been involved 
In these decisions... 

Is It too bold to sug- 
gest that few men can under- 
stand pre'gnancy or delivery 
or the reaction of a woman 
to Che denial of an abortion? 
Perhaps an analogy offered 
by Dr. Natalie Shalncss, 
noted for het work In the 
psychology of women and the 
mothering aspecc of women's 
experience would make the 
reaction to the denial of 
an abortion raore under- 
standable: 

"...It's as if, let's 
say, people arc walking 
along the street .. .some get 
across the street, some are 
stopped by a red light and 
let's aseume that for no 
other reason than that they 
are stopped by a red light, 
these people are told this: 
'From now on, for about 
nine months, you are going 
to have to carry a twenty- 
five pound pack on your 
back. Now you will have to 
endure it , whether you de- 
velope ulcers under Che load, 
wheCher your spine becomes 
deformed, you and this are 
inseparable, 

"Then after nine months 
you rasy drop this load, but 
from now on you are going to 
have It tied to your waist. 
So that wherever you go this 
Is going Co be with you the 
rest of your life and if, by 
some accident, the rope Is 
cut or the chain is cut, 
that piece of rope is al- 
ways going to be tied to 
you to remind you of it." 
(Schulder and Kennedy: Abor- 
tion Rap, pg. 125) 

It may well be the case 
chat In the not too distant 
future women will be pro- 
hiblced from what chey are 
now forced Co do, and will 
be forced to do what la now 
prohibited. Abortion may well 
be compulsory and pregnancy 
prohibited because of popu- 
lation problems. There have 
been recent instances (e.g. 
New York) where welfare 
mothers were told chey could 
get an abortion only If 
they agreed to be sterilized. 
When will women get to make 
a choice for chemselves? 

To summarize, I feel that 
compulsory pregnancy vio- 
lates the right of a woman 
to control her own body, and 
is not in the best interest 
of the child. Rather than 
either abortion or com- 
pulsory pregnancy, I would 
much prefer a more enlist- 
ened education for both 
women and men, and improved 
contraception. At present 
we have neither.

'*Lord of the Flies" 
movie of week 

"Lord of the Files", Che 
Movie of the Week of the lU 
Film Series, will be shown 
Friday, Feb. 25 at the 
Indiana-Purdue campus. The 
film's story Is that of a 
group of stranded English 
school boys, victims of a 
plane crash during their 
evacuation from a war- 
threatened London. On an 
uninhabited Island, and 
without adult control, the 
boys (played with astonishing 
skill by a group of non- 
professionals) regress to a 
savage and anarchic state, 
turning on its head in the 
process the Victorian myth 
of childhood purity and 
innocence. 

Directed by Peter Brook, 
the film Is based on che 
novel by William Golding. 
"Lord of the Flies" will 
be shown at A:30, 7:00 and 
9:30 p.m. in room 146-

Dr. Bartelt said he came 
Co lU-Purdue bwhy can't we 
help each other?" 

Students never learn to 
accept the lie of lies, that 
schools are for learning. 
Instead, they acquiesce, 
but not quickly nor In all 
cases fully. That resistance 
lingers In many students Is 
manifest through classroom 
pranks, dull expressions, de- 
linquency, and feigned dumb- 



Eventually, most stu- 
dents acquiesce entirely. 
The lesson is learned. Life 
is absurd. This lesson is 
extremely important in 
accomplishing one of the 
desired ends of the molding 
process; an individual com- 
fortable in an absurd en- 
vironment. This is the con- 
serving function of schools, 
to transmit the status quo 
intact. 

The second lesson of 
school is the lesson of hate: 
how to hate thy neighbor. 
Schools dispense a limited 
a number of rewards for per- 
formance, but an unlimited 
number of C's, D's, and P'a. 
This lesson is easily learned: 
no one succeeds unless some- 
one faila. In Culture Against 
Han , Jules Henry remarks that 
schools must teach children 
to hate without appearing to 



Again, schools are per- 
forming a valuable function 
for society. Individuals are 
well trained at competing 
for scarce rewards. Those 
who are gifted or successful 
at limiting the successes 
of their fellow students 
are appropriately directed 
into the ninteenth cen- 
tury economic system of 
American culture, an econo- 
mic system not surprisingly 
based upon scarcity. Those 
who are less successful are 
patted on the shoulder, com- 
plemented for being "well- 
rounded," and subtly pre- 
pared for future inequality.

Record review: 
"Harvest" 

by Dave Hill 

After keeping his devout 
band of fans waiting for 
nearly two years, Neil Young 
has finally broken the sus- 
pense with a new album, 
Harvest , on the Warner Bro- 
thers-Reprise label . 

Young's followers have 
increased in number con- 
siderably since Che release 
of his last album, After 
the Gold Rush . 

Gold Rush received 
glittering reviews from 
nearly every music publi- 
cation, and the record- 
buying public showed they 
agreed with the critics by 
making it a best-seller. 

Gold Rush is a tough 
act to follow, but I think 
Young may have equaled It 
with Harvest . The music 
has a country flavor, and 
most of the cuts were done 
in a Nashville studio with 
s superb band, the Stray 
Gators. 

Two Bongs were also done 
with the London Symphony 
Orchestra. It's hard to 
imagine Neil's voice backed 
up by a symphony orchestra, 
but the songs come off sur- 
prisingly well. 

My favorite song on the 
album Is "Out on the Week- 
end, " a Bad country tune 
with some smooth steel 
guitar and simple but clean 
harmonica. Also good is 
"Alabama," a fast, electric 
song with backup vocals by 
Stills and Nash. 

"Heart of Gold" is a 
hit. (Sure la nice to hear 
Nell's strange vocal chorda 
on the radio) and the title 
song, "Harvest," has also 
received some airplay. 

If you like whsC Neil 
Young's done before, you 
csn't go wrong with thla 
album. If you don't like 
his voice, don't buy it, 
because its definitely all 
Neil. (Crosby, Stills, and 
Nash only do a few background 
vocals. ) 

Harvest sounds better every 
time I play it and I only 
hope Its not another two yesra 
before he releases another 



ALIENATION, ANOHIE 

CONTINUED FROM COLUMN AT LEFT 

Then there are those 
few who cannot be molded. 
They are politely labeled 
"disadvantaged," "emotional 
cases," "incorrigible," and 
"delinquents." After labling, 
these groupings are not-so- 
politely disposed of. 

In achools, the medium is 
truly the message, I wonder 
If McLuhan gained this in- 
sight through conversations 
with a third grader. 

Next week, lesson three: 
identity through loneliness.

to work one evening a week 
teaching basic educational 
skills to camp residents. 

According to Earl Cummlngs, 
instructor at the camp, col- 
lege students who can assist 
the residents In learning 
at all levels in the edu- 
cational system, are ur- 
gently requested to donate 
their time and talonts to 
the camp educational pro- 
gram. Educational back- 
grounds of the residents va- 
ry from grade school to col- 
lege, although deficiencies 
in English, mathmatlca, and 
reading prevail at all levels. 
Residents preparing for high 
school equivalency tests are 
In particular need of assist- 
ance In areas of algebra, 
basic English, literature, and 
social studies, and science. 

Volunteer tutors do not re- 
quire special quallflcatlona, 
Cummlngs stressed.

P U Wives Club 
to sponsor grant 

At a recent meeting of 
the Purdue Wives Club It 
waa voted to give a grant 
to a needy Purdue woman 
student. Because no grant 
was made last year, two wo- 
men are currently eligible. 
It was further agreed that 
gifts from members ear- 
narked for student aid 
would go to the revolving 
loan fund for students so 
that the money would get 
maximum use. 

The group also decided 
to build with the help 
of Camp Red Cedar a perma- 
nent collection box for 
depositing glass to be re- 
cycled. The box will be 
located adjacent to the 
parking lot In the area of 
the Co-op Extension Center. 

Mrs. Robert Hawley la 
president of the group. Mrs. 
Richard Hess is chairman of 
Che scholarship committee 
and Mrs. Norbert Schedler is 
in charge of the glass col- 
lection construction. 



A statewide series of 

public hearings on the fu- 
ture of higher education 
in Indiana has been 
scheduled for February and 
early March. 

Conducting the hearlnga 
will be the State Commission 
for Higher Education. O.C. 
Carmichael Jr., of South 
Bend, Commission chairman, 
said the hearings will give 
Individual citizens, as well 
as spokesmen, for organiza- 
tions and Institutions an 
opportunity to express 
their opinions. 

The actions of the Com- 
mission can affect the de- 
gree of tax support for 
higher education, the amount 
of tuition paid by stu- 
dents, the quality of medi- 
cal education, the avail- 
ability of vocational ed- 
ucational opportunities and 
other Issues. 

"Ihe Commission has been 
charged with Che responsi- 
bility of developing a mas- 
ter plan for post-high 
school education In Indiana," 
Carmichael said. "To prop- 
erly carry out this re- 
sponsibility, Che Commission 
needs to hear from the citi- 
zens of our state. Their 
knowledge, interest, con- 
cerns and advice can be Im- 
portant components of the 
final plan." 



Commissioner for Higher 
Education, James B. Kessler, 
said Che hearings will seek 
Co Identify major public 
policy questions on higher 
education as well as alter- 
nate answers Co those 
questions. The gathering 
of this Information, he 
said, "is one of the most 
important steps in Che 
planning process." 

The Commission, created 
by Che Indiana General As- 
aembly, has scheduled a 
meeting here for Wednesday,

Dreams Baby 



By Mark Souder 

"I'll rot nay that death 
Is a terrible thing; but I 
will say that It la so real 
a thing that when It comes 
close, all the Imaginary 
things — all the stories, as 
you call them— fade Into 
mere dreams beside that In- 
exorable reality." --George 
Bernard Shaw. 

A tired Bruce Menshy 
stood at the free throw line, 
his team trailing by a couple 
of points with only a few 
seconds left. Bruce was 
known for his steady nerves 
ever since the third grade 
when his teacher disci- 
plined him by making him 
crawl under her desk while 
she taught. He fell 
aaleep. 

But this was different. 
The Leo Mafia needed this 
victory ovet the undefeated 
Barnstormers if they were to 
have hopes of gaining the 
regular season divisional 
crown. Their dreams having 
been swelled by a 30 point 
average winning margin, the 
looming defeat wore heavy 
on Bruce 's strong shoulders. 
The words apoken by Shaw's 
character, spunky and pretty 
Lavinla, may not have 
crossed Bruce's mind, but 
he at least saw the visions 
of trophies that had been 
dancing In his head as 
being in serious jeopardy, 

Bruce missed (as did 
several others of the Mafia 
gang) and the dreams vanished. 
The Barnstormers rolled on, 
with a big 63-59 win. Com- 
bining the best overall de- 
fense this reporter has wit- 
nessed thus far, with a hot- 
shooting offense, the close 
game (never more than a 
four point spread either 
way), ended in their favor. 
Mike Teagarden led their 
scoring attack with 20 
points, including many pretty 
outside shots. The rugged 
inside play of Fred Bruns and 
Pat O'Reilly, the tenacious 
defensive play of Jim McCarron 
and the smooth leaderahlp of 
Bill Beard proved too much. 
The Mafia, upon pulling 
out their violin cases to 
bring out their guns, 
came up short a second 
String. Led again by Steve 
Bolller with 21, and in 
spite of 17 from an im- 
proving Tom Sebert, the 
Mafia just didn't quite have 
enough . 

The only undefeated team 
In Division 1 Is the cocky 
Jocks. After a rather 
dubious start (they got the 
tip and headed the wrong 
direction), they went on 
to justify their cockiness 
by pounding Grissom 83-36, 
The Blackburn-Cane -Frank B- 
Vlnebrenner-Hansen com- 
bination displayed amazing 



Mastodons to play in campus tourney 



balance and awesome scoring 
power (Grlasom showed balance 
too but no scoring). 

Add the Jocks top scorer 
Rich Yost (who missed the 
rout), and it's a super team. 
Tom Blackburn, who led the 
way with 24 the other night, 
has got lightning quick in- 
side moves. Tall center, 
Ruaty Cane haa probably the 
best looking shot in the 
league. He can ripple the 
net from inside or out. 

The Jocks support isn't 
bad either. The other night 
even rough Steve Evans 
somehow hit three baskets 
without a miss. And of 
cour«e there's the famous 
press. Whether they only 
lead U-3 or 43-3, Coach 
Brock Able Is yelling, 
"Press 'em, press 'eml" 
Only the press of the un- 
defeated Meg's Hen compares. 
Hane's Underwear, another 
team still nursing hopes for 
a Division II tournament 
berth, won a key game over 
Essex, 59-53. Though team 
captain and one of the 
league's more productive 
scorers, Jeff Hoehn, played 
a relatively mediocre game, 
and though Louie Roy had 
thia mental hang-up about 
layups (and physical; they 
kept scrunching him), the 
team's balance paid off, 
Louie, my favorite half of 
a former great high school 
guard combination, did play 
another great ballgame. 
Pxobably the best after-the- 
'whistle field goal shooter 
in the league, he also scored 
19 points in play, which 
didn't hurt his Division 
II leading average much. 

As the tournament nears, 
the excitement increases. 
The tourney bertha go to 
the top four teams in each 
division, for which there 
is considerable jockeying. 
The serious teams which 
scout, keep scoring charts, 
and practice are starting to 
dominate, Stylea are 
emerging, like the presaes 
of Meg's Men and the Jocks, 
and the ruggedness of the 
Posse. 

Individual players also 
stand out, be they shooters 
like Bolller or Roy, or 
just key, steady, dependable 
leaders like Steve Otten- 
weller of the Meg's Hen, 
The dreams are fading 
Into "inexorable reality." 
I've been dreaming of a 
big game. The other night, 
I figured out that if I'd 
have played the entire game 
and would have acored at 
the sane rate, I'd have 
poured In 33.5 points. But 
the "inexorable reality," 
as Lavlnia would say, was 
that I scored 5 points. 
That's dreams, baby
