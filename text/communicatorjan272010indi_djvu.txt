can get a job that will make you $16 an hour. On some boards, it is only $13 an hour; but, the message is the same: you 
can get a good paying job easily. But that would be too good to be true, right?

of your own research, you can find out more about 
what Vector Marketing is and once you do. It starts

information in the first place." Jeremy Moore said. 

Moore explained that Vector Marketing works to grow up lo be the

kitchen utensils. The 
marketing company is 
then in charge of getting 
students to work selling

By presenting a possible salary much higher than 
minimum wage, Vector Marketing has been able 
to appeal to students who wouldn't have given it a 
second look oiher\vi5e. 

"The only people vvho would have jumped at the 
opportunity to sell knives would be people who want 
Billy Mays or Sham-Wow 
Guy." Moore said. 

Others, however, 
credit Vector with helping 
them become better 
business people.

Some also think it is the individual at fault and not 
Vector. 

"This is a job that you actually have to work to 
be successful. The only reason why people quit 
is because they give up on themselves." A Vector 



representative from Nashua, New Hampshire, wrote 
on the Indeed message board. 

An IPFW student who wanted to remain 
anonymous because he worked for the organization 
last year said, "The problem is ifyou don't know super 
rich people, you won't sell anything." 

The student outlined the hiring process. "On Day 
I , you go in for an interview and you are told to talk 
about your goals and who you are. Then you are taken 
into a room where they show you all of the products 
they are selling." he said. After that, the trainer asks 
whether the merchandise is liked or not. 

"If you're not impressed, they don't call you back." 
the student said. 

On Day 2, the managers go over the process of 
selling, how it works and how to sell. The next day, 
the applicants get to see who made it and who didn't. 

"We were lold to bring our cell phones and when 
we got there, they said to look at your contacts." the 
student said. "You were supposed to call everyone in 
your contacts to try to sell. It was like a contest." 

In the end, he had to quit because he couldn't set 
up any sales meetings because most of the people he 
knew were poor college students who couldn't afford 
to buy $800 worth of knives. 




Stellar Awards: Not just gospel 

First woman to own a gospel radio station at IPFW 



By Nana Kawash 

hina hiviiihSy^ha o. com 

As the owner of a gospel radio 
station in Fort Wayne, Deborah 
Godwin-Starks is an inspiration to 
gospel music lovers from all over 
the nation. As a communications 
professor at IPFW, she is an 
inspiration to her students. 

Godwin-Starks has a lot on 
her plate already, but even more 
was added the weekend of lanuary 
16 when she attended the Stellar 
Awards at the Grand Ole Opry 
in Nashville, Tennessee. At the 
awards ceremony she received a 
certificate of honor for being the 
first woman lo own a gospel radio 
station. 

"TheSlellarAwardsisthelargest 
award program for people who are 
involved with radio, television. 



and internet, particularly in gospel 
music," said Godwin-Starks, 

In its 25"' year, die Stellar 
Awards is an event where gospel 
artists and contributors from all 
over the nation come together 
to honor each other for their 
contributions to the gospel music 
industry. Godwin-Slarks was not 
in competition with anyone, but 
was recognized for her efforts in 
the gospel music community. 

As for gospel music itself, there 
is more to it than the prayerftil 
church tunes you hear on Sunday. 
Unlike some genres of music, it is 
mulci faceted. 

"Gospel music is a whole field 
to itself," said Godwin-Starks, who 
does not sing gospel other than 
in the shower. "Straight from my 
moudi to the angel's ears," she 
said, laughing at herself. 



Gospel music does entertain 
those soulful, passionate Sunday 
church songs as well. But it also 
lends itself lo the styles of jazz, 
hip-hop/R&amp;B and even rap. 

Some of the artisis who 
performed at the Stellar Awards 
were well-known artists such as 
Mary Mary, Hezekiah Walker, and 
Waller Hawkins. If you would 
like to see these wonderful artists 
in action or hear the variations 
of gospel music, check out the 
recording of the awards program 
yourself. Godwin-starks says that 
it is "equal to the Grammy's for 
gospel music," 

Ifyou have the WON America, 
it will be available for viewing on 
Sunday, February 21 at 5 p,m. If 
you would rather see it from the 
Gospel Music Channel, it will air 
on Sunday, February 28 at 8 p.m.

Smoke Hut Diaries 



By Robin Crowell 

job inyoutgravtBgiTMi l.com 



Music forms the basis 
by which we make and judge a 
lot of tlie people we choose to 
surround ourselves with. I've 
noticed this not only in the 
smoke hut, but also simply in 
passing through each day. Any 
music enthusiast will never 
admit to choosing their friends 
based on music or anything 
viewed by die moral majority 
as trivial an interest, but it's 
true. Let us analyze in terms of 
extremes and stereotypes, shall 
we? 

A young man traversing 
campus in dirt encrusted denim, 
work boots, a cowboy hal, and 
sun-ripened skin probably isn't 
going to meet a study group 
prefaced with discussion about 
the latest Lil'Waynerelease. The 
group will gather in discussion 
about working tiring days and 
dieir country music that reflects 
their hardships. This is reversed 
as well. The people raving about 
the new Lif Wayne album more 



than likely have no interest in 
gathering around a table to talk 
aboutToby Keith. 

Picture a girl, probably a 
freshman. She's walking to 
class, a backpack full of an 
entire semester's worth of 
books, apparently ignorant to 
the general ebb and flow of how 
a semester works. Her iPod is 
hlled with a combination of pop 
princesses. Kelly Ciarkson. Katy 
Perry, maybe some Taylor Swift 
for good measure. Do you really 
think she's going to take a chance 
and mingle with a group of kids 
clad in tattered black shirts, 
flannels, worn jeans, and black 
Chuck Taylors? My estimation: 
probably not. 

There are countless amounts 
of labels associated with music. 
There are punks, hipsters, indie 
kids, emo kids, rappers, hardcore 
kids, country folk, and so many 
more of the like. As a society of 
labels we decide who to or who 
not to be friends with based 
on their music tastes. In a way 
though, this isn't a bad thing. 

The music that we listen to is 
a direct reflection of the lives we 



live or fantasize about living. If 
music is the icebreaker, the first 
conversation inclusiveof any sort 
of relatable content, a lot of the 
individual tends to be revealed. 
I, myself, take pride in relating to 
songs about smoking my lungs 
into arrest. Hike knowing that so 
many tilings that I've wanted to 
say but have never been able to 
word adequately have been put 
to song by some of my heroes. 

Alkaline TYio, The Lavvrence 
Arms, Chuck Ragan, Frank 
"nirner, Lucero, Against Me!, 
and so many more bands 
and musicians that 1 could 
pretentiously name drop have 
reflected my actions, pasis, 
present, and more than hkely 
my future. Tlie people that 1 
surround myself with have a 
similar musical perspective to 
my own, maybe not the exact 
bands, maybe not the exact 
pinpointed genre even, but they 
see music in the same fashion 
that 1 do. So, in all honestiy, don't 
feel bad about choosing your 
friends over music. There are 
worse faults that we can fall to.

Should conflict be 
welcomed or avoided? 

By Hana and Devin 



Hana: Depends on what you mean, what are 
you talking about? 

Devim Arguments. I love 'em. 

Hana: Yeah, I know. 

DeWn: You don't like arguments? 

Hana: Sometimes. , 

Devin: What do you mean sometimes? 

Hana: Depends on what il is about. 

Devin; They are always good, I love 'em. 

Hana: Ha, yes I know that. I think that 
certain times you have to argue, like when you 
have to call someone out, but sometimes you 
need to just let things go. 

Devin: That is never a solution, what do you 
mean let things go? 

Hana: lust littie stuff. For example, one of 
my friends kept doing tilings that were making 
me mad and I was letting it go but it got to the 
point where I couldn't take anymore, and I had 
to call her out on it. When stuff builds up I feel 
like you have to but if it's just one thing I don't 
really care. 

Devin: Or you could just nip it in the bud 
right from the start to avoid the bigger conflict 
altogether. You could have a litde disagreement 
or a big argument. 

Hana: But dien if you call someone out on 
something small they might think you're petty. 
I don't try to make it a big deal. I jtist say what's 
on my mind and let the person know that I 
needed to talk about iL 

Devin: Well it depends, some things can 
stay a little disagreement but some things have 
quite the targe potential to build up so I think 
it depends. If you feel it has potential to build 
up into a big argument you shoidd kill it right 
there, end its life. 

Hana: So basically, you welcome conflict at 
anytime and aoy way 

Devtiu I love it. 

Hana: Alright then.

Does Being Green mean no Sunday Driving? 



QQQQ 



By Hana Hawash 

lu lUhawiulieyaliDO. corn 



The President passed a new law called "Carless 
Sunday." From here on out, it will be illegal to drive 
anywhere on Sundays. 

lusl kidding, bui some people think thai it would 
be great if we have this law set in place. With the way 
society pollutes tlie earth these days, green activists 
are looking for more and more ways on how we can 
try and pollute a httle less. White some diink that 
outlawing automobiles on Sundays is overly extreme, 
others feel that this is extraordinarily simply. 

On a forum found on treehugger.com, Alex Davies 
of NYC suggests thai Americans should lake Sundays 
off from our cars and try walking, biking or simply 
staying home in an effort to put a hold on some of the 
toxins in our air. What Davies was looking for were 



suggestions on how to start a movement like this. 

People commenting on the forum ask how they 
aresupposed to gel to church. One commenter stales 
the obvious: "Walk to church, why not? In the old 
days, people did so. It is good for the soul, the soles 
too," this clever activist writes. 

Others argue that their church might be too far to 
walk if it is more than half a mile away. Apparently, 
Americans just do not walk, not even if their car is not 
working... phonealriend, eh? 

Others on the forum question this idea and 
whether il is actually feasible. Since the creator of 
the forum suggests staying home and watching 
television, someone replied: "Kind of conflicts with 
the US's 24/7/365 culture. .You suggest maybe 
waichingTV, who runs the stadon, the power plant?" 

While this person brings up a good point, the 
movement would obviously have to make exceptions. 
For example, if there was a fire. The fire department 



would not likely hall buckets of water on bikes lo the 
scene of the fire and police probably would not be 
able to hall a murderous criminal on foot to the local 
jail. But as for groceries and television stations, what 
exactly is wrong with buying groceries ahead of time 
or not watching television? God forbid that we do not 
have a picture box to stare into all day. 

Americans need to stop being lazy and start 
doing something for ourselves and each other. Let 
us stop the pollution for one day oui of seven. Let 
us be together with friends and family for a day just 
relaxing and talking. Let us leach our children how 
to play baseball with a real bat rather than the Wii 
controller. Even here at IPFW. we run a shuttle service 
that is geared towards saving the air by reducing the 
number of cars running around campus. We have 
slaned something, let us do even more and show our 
city, our state and maybe even our nation how little 
efforts can be so usehil.

Matt Robinson 



By Holly Gallaway 

9all&gt;uOieiludenu.rpfw.edi&gt; 



After a year at Indiana University not studying 
music, junior Malt Robsinon transferred to IPFW. 
One of the main reasons he transferred was that he 
spent a lot of lime in his dorm room lisiening to Stevie 
Wonder instead of attending his classes. Robinson had 
been involved in music through grade school and high 
school, but he says it didn't become his passion until 
his first year of college. After he realized how much he 
lovedmusicRobinsondecided to transfer to IPFW and 
work toward a major in vocal performance. 

Robinson was in the school band until his 
sophomore year at Concordia Lutheran, just down 
the street. At that point he felt like trying something 
different, so he swiiched to choir and tennis and began 
taking an active role in drama. By his senior year, he 
was a part of the elite Chamber Singers at Concordia, 
as well as playing tennis and acting in the school plays. 
Though he says music still wasn't his passion at that 
point, be frequently walked through the halls singing. 

As fotwhathewantstodoivithhisvocal performance 
degree, he says he wants to do something in the 
entertainment industry. When asked if he wanted to 
stay in the^Fon Wayne area, he said he'd go wherever he 



had to. Obwously, with Sweetwater, there are recording 
studio-related jobs in Jort Wayne, but if he wanted 
to pursue acting with vocal performance, he would 
likely have to go elsewhere. As for acting, Robinson is 
currently involved with the Civic Theater's production 
of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat — 
he's playing Levi, one of the twelve brothers. This is 
the first acting he's done since high school. He is also 
involved in the Opera Chorus, playing Maximillian in 
their selection ofsongs from QiHdidi?. -Robinson is also 
in the Don ]uans, a men's a cappella group here at IPFW. 
Robinson also mentioned Voices of Unity as something 
he'd like to get involved in again. He's worked ivith 
the group before and it is his favorite activity. He says 
Don luans fun and it gives him a great chance to be 
a mentor to young children. He enjoys it because the 
music they focus on is music that would not normally 
be performed around town. Robinson lauds Voice of 
Unity as a great organization that gives a more well- 
rounded vocal experience. However, music and vocal 
performance aren't the only loves in Robinson's life. 

"I have a billion other things I'm interested in," 
he says \vith a laugh. Various sports such as tennis, 
raquetball, basketball, and ultimate Frishee occupy his 
time. The first pastime he mentioned was the possibly 
the most intriguing — competitive Super Smash 
Brothers Melee. "It's the best multi-player game out 
there right now," Robinson says. 



A Mozart 

Moment 



By Louisa Danielson 



This is the month of Mozart. At least, 
it is for the Fort Wayne Philharmonic. 
On lanuary 16, their first Mastenvorks 
concert of the New Year featured an all- 
Mozart program, loaded with plenty of 
the famous composer's best works. 

The concert opened with the 
Symphony no. 31 in D Major, K. 297. 
Called the 'Paris' symphony, this work 
had a pleasant tune that was quiet 
yet animated, full of varied tones. 
Shimmering scales and arpeggios 
exploded from the string section at the 
close of the final movement. 

The second work to be performed 
was the Concerto in A Major for Clarinet 
and Orchestra, K. 622. Guest clarinetist 
Anthony McGill was outstanding. 
Throughout the three movements of 
the concerto, he had beautiful dynamic 
control, drawing the orchestra from 
grand crescendos into such quiet 
pianissimos that it sounded like only 
one or tivo strings were playing from 
the whole orchestra. The soloist was a 



pleasure to listen to, and the orchi 
responded well to his musical signal 

Following the intermission, 
orchestra presented an Adngio 
Fugue in C Minor for Strings, K. 
Thesetwo movements were very mui 
the shvj and grand style of a Bach o 
exercise, full of deliberate pauses 
di\ndwl strings. For the opening o 
fugue, the melody began in the do 
bass and cello sections then b 
sevLTal measures later with a reileri 
of the same tune in the upper strin 
sounded like an orchestrated versioi 
keyboard work.

These two movements were very much in 
the slow and grand st&gt;'le of a Bach organ 
exercise full of deliberate pauses and 
divided strings. For the opening of the 
fugue, the melody began in the double 
bass and cello sections then began 
several measures later ivith a reiteration 
of the lianie tune in the upper strings. It 
sounded like an orchestrated version of a 
keyboaid work. 

The final piece of the concert was the 
Syinphony No. 35 in D Major, K. 385. Also 
called the Haffner" sj-mphony, this piece 
opened with grand octaves in the style

the tune to an exciting, edge-of-the chair 
tempo during the fourth movement.

orchestra received a standing ovation. A

Artist: Spoon 

Album: Transference 

Label; Merge 

Release Date: January 19. 20l8 

Sounds Like: Modest Mouf 
early years smoothed over i 
" nbient experimentation, 
^ting: 4/5 



The hesi way to describe the 
introduction of this album is warm 
and icy at the same time. It begins 
with "Before Destruction," with 
slow, raspy vocals and music that is 
relaxing without being boring. 

The tracks that follow integrate 
simplistic percussion, at times 
with an almost alternative-country 
approach to the composition. 
However, once this label comes to 
mind, it changes entirely with the 



usage of electronica. As to not be 
misunderstood in this statement, 
this album is not "dancey" in any 
way. 

Some tracks like "I Saw The Light" 
and "Trouble Comes Running" sound 
sexy, almost musically seductive. 
Then, to throiv an entirely new 
curveball into the mix, "Goodnight 
Laura" is what can best be described 
as a lullaby. 

Transference guides the listener 
through many different types of 
putting together music, including 
simplisticpercussion, piano, techno/ 
electronic , and changes in vocal 
styling. The album does well to hold 
interest and generally isn't bating or 
repetitive. It is not a perfect release, 
however , it is one of those albums 
ivith a fitting release date.

Artist; Modon City Soundtrack 
Album: My Dinosaur Life 
Label; Columbia 
Release Date: lanuary 19, 2010 
Sounds Like: A mental disorder 
put to music in a good way. 
Rating: 3.5/5 



As far as music goes, 2010 has 
yet to mark a complete and utter 
disappointment and this album is 
no exception. 

Although slightly generic and 
standard at times. My Dinosaur 
Life still holds true to the standards 
and musical implements set forth 
by earlier Motion City Soundtrack 
works. A bit of experimentation is 
evident, however nothing to mark 
drasdc changes in their repertoire. 



Die introduciori' track, "WbrkLT 
Bee", is catchy, jolly, and mt'lanchuly 
all at the same time which Motion 
City is notorious for beingable to pull 
off swimmingly. And, as is typical, 
prevalent is a great and impressive 
amount of vocaJ control not only on 
this track but throughout the entirety 
of the album. 

Humor is not lost on Motion 
City in a track like "Delirium" which 
udlizes hilarious metaphors that 
make no sense what-so-ever. The 
song also is probably the stand-out 
track of the album. It is catchy as all 
get out and intensely entertaining. 

For a fun listen with gentle 
nuances, catchy riffs, and of course.. . 
the moog. give this album a spin or 
two. It's enough to make die dull 
subside during any winter day.
