lU-PU COMMUNICATOR 



System 



by Scon GiHie Committees 



In the complex of overlapping Interests and jurisdic- 
tions thfougiiout the university, the "ioint commiKee" con- 
sisting of faculty members, students, and administrators is 
often the vehicle through which administrative decisions 
are determried. Ollen the members of (he committees spend 
considerable time in the deliberation of different issues. 
The recommendations sent to the Dean and to the Chan- 
cellor are generally followed. 

However, certain recommend itions are not. The com* 
mitlees sometimes find themselves spending considerable 
time arriving at solutions to various problems only to see 
thefr recommendations vetoed—sometimes without explana* 
tion. 

Furthermore, some committees consult the adminis- 
trative officer to whom the recommendation is to be given 
before taking a vole on the matter—in order to be saved the 
disgrace of having a decision vetoed. The committees con- 
tribute substantially in insuring that decisions are rendered 
which represent all viewpoints in consideration. Why then 
should these committees continue to operate if the ultimate 
decision is made in spite of the committee work or even 
before (he committee formally takes up a particular matter. 

Not that the committees need be given absolute author- 
ity and responsibility In these decisions, that would not be 
a desirable or feasible alternative. What is necessary—ab- 
solutely imperative-is that the recommendations of the va- 
rious joint committees be fallowed within reason. If a veto 
is deemed appropriate by the administrative officer to whom 
the recommendation is given, an explanation should accom- 
pany the veto. This explanation should not be a written 
note to the committee but an appearance before the univer- 
sity senates and the Student Assembly. This is not to de- 
stroy the authority of the higher ranking administrative, of- 
ficers but to restore shaky confidence in the potentiiilly' 
effective committee sys^m.

The I. -P. COMMUNI- 
CATOR would like lo ex- 

loDcborah Mitchell, who did 
not write the letlcr-to-the-

sue 17, lust week. The let- 
ter had a type written sig- 

chcck the authority of the

pidity of the student who 
pulled such a rotten trick 
will he corrected and also, 
that the student will have 
the guta to apologize to all

This situation has for- 
ced the I. -P. C&amp;MMUNI-

to their editorial policy: all 
letters or editorials written 
by a person who wishes to

Yith 



sun shiny smiles and splash- 
ing harcfool in puddles af- 
ter genlle rains are moments 
of life with meaning to Shar- 
on. 

What do 1 think, she 
thinks, about people sow- 
ing wild oats six days a 
week and then going to 
Church on Sunday, ya asks. 
O'Leary, me guesses she 
thinks that on Sunday they 
will pray for a crop failure. 

Soy O'Leary, what does 
ya think of a lovely lass, who 
on a miserable, foggy, rainy 
•lay. would be happy having 



a nice warm puppy dog lo 
hold? Who might she be ya 
iaquires? She be Kathy Kcrn- 
thal's who. . , . 

Bunches of dazzi'ing or- 
ange, .dasics, with flocks 
of red and yellow pansies 
arc exciting moments in her 

life-. : : ■ 

What does she think of 
tbe popular myth that this is 
a man's world. She has on

be treated as person and wo- 

Be there any more ya 
ask. Tis with pleasure 1 say 
there are. Meet Jiine Fleck, 
Lcary; me apologizes tor 
not havin the pleasure yet 
to do the same. June me 
thinks is a child of the -sun, 
with all the brightness and 
warmth that the sommer 
month of June suggests. 

What do 1 think she 
thinks of science's progress 
in recent years. Me thinks 
June would say that sci- 
ence's great strides leave 
them only about 20 years be- 
hind the comic books.
