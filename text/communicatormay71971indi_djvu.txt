Guest Editorial 

What the hell gives?? 



by John Sirr 



E a bit 



stnnge to me that after months of hassling, the Black 
Student Union has suddenly been given control over $2,800 for a Black His- 
tory Week, to be held next year. I wouFd not qjestion the validity of the need 
of a DIack History Week, but I am somewhat suspicious of the tactics used 
to get the money for it. The way I have been made to understand the situation 
follows: 

I). Scott Gillie, '70-71 Student Body President, is graduating this June. 

2). Mr. Gillie has beert seeking a position on the Mayor's Metropolitan 
Human Relations Council as employment after he graduates 

3). Mr. Eugene Fullmore, head of the Black Student Union, wrote a let- 
ter, which was printed in the ^Ne^s Sentinel insinuating that Mr, Gillie was 
a Racist for not giving them the funds they requested, despite the fact that 
it was Unconstitutional to give funds to student organizations which are ra- 
cially exclusive, as is Black Student Union. 

4). Mr, Gillie, understandably fearful of being branded a racist (which 
I find hard to believe), took quick action to make sure that the Black Stu- 
dents got the money requested. 

5), When the motion was brought up in the Student Assembly, Mr. Ful- 
tmorewas present and requested and/or demanded that the S2,600 allocation 
be made. Also fearing to be branded racists, most members of the A^em- 
bly abstained to avoid the necessity of voting nay, a Ithough not recorded in 
the Assembly minutes, the passing vote was reportedly three ayes. 

Admittedly, I cannot claim all of these points to be facts, since no one 
seems to want to talk about them. And the few who have, do not wish to 
have their names used. However! I do feel that the situation is serious e- 
nough to warrant the reply to these questions: 

I). Has Mr, Gillie attempted to use Student funds to buy himself a seat 
on the Mayor's Metropolitan Human RelationsCouncil if 

2). Has the Black Student Union tried to hold the sword of'RacJst'- 
over anyone who does not give it what (tlwants? 

3), Was the majority of the present Student Assembly acting it 
less manner by not taking a position on the issue? 

4). Was the entire action of giving the Black Student Unioi 



spine- 



I control 



over $2,800 in students' money illegal by reason that the passing vote vi 



officially given?

We appreciated the support of 
all those students who backed SLF 
in the student government elerlions. 
While such a narrow defeat uias dis- 
couraging we nevertheless feel our 
effort was worthwhile. The dedica- 
tion of our friends and the hours of 
hard work by our supporters was 
gratifying. He really enjoyed the 
opportunity to meet and talk with so 
many students. Such experiences

I think I would like to define ihe philosophical position I 
prefer at the moment as Irustfal agnosticism. I accept my life 
in wonder as a gift to be enjoyed responsibly, but I remain 
ignorant about the totality which is my ultimate context. I 
aspire to trust myself to the happenings which interweave wiUi 
my energies to form an incarnate and situated person. I am 
not uncomfortable in saying that my trust in the ultimate 
context of my life is invested in God, provided the word "God"

Two students for justice 



To the Bditorr 

I have a complaint! Upstairs 
on second floor in a showcase is 
a sign stating "You are a Piggy 
student if you created this litter" 
and there is a lot of litter lying 
in the case. However, that litter 
is nothing, compared to the shit 
that is located in the stair well 
from the top to the bottom floor. 
Malii-colorcd trash sheets identi- 
fying queen candidates are scat- 
tered over almost every inch of the 
wall. Herefore I say Queen can- 
didate sponsors-YOU ARE THE 
PIG PEN STUDENTS.

Something has lo be done about our overcrowded Cafeteria. Things arc 
geiitni; so bad in there that at times a person can't even find a teat. It 
wouMn'I bother mc so much if these (oiks had a justifiable reason for being 
[here but most of them are there just to eat' Don't the/ have kitchens of 
their own to go to' Here we are with a revolution to carry on, an education 
lo complete, and time to kill, and they just sit there and rncim li, munch, 
munch. I tcli you, it is enough to cause one lo lose faith. 

He should appeal lo someone with a little authority and ask him to do 
something about these conditions I mentioned it to one Prof, who said that 
he had as litde authority as anyone around and would be glad to help us 
Lul even as he spoke he was concealing a hamburger under his elbow. What 
we need rs people who are sincere We need to convince others that with 
space at a premium on this campus, we can only expect increased diffi 
cullies by allowing such a waste to continue I ask you what does a diner 
accomplish hut a full stomach? I mean, there is just so much a person can 
do with a peanut butter and mustard sandwich on Rye On the other hand 
if the eaters were cleared out the space could be uilliicd much more effcc 
lively Consider the truism that marc learning occurs in the Cafeteria than 
in the classrooms Think of what is already being accomplished by those 
few who arc able to squeeze into the Cafeteria, prefcrrers of soul satisfac- 
tion rather than stomach stuffing It has been said that. Eyes which bow to 
beans shill ne'er behold true beauty ' Education is beautiful

ne of the mast educational things to have recently been discovered 
in the Cafeteria is Spring s gift to the lecher Hotpants. Not too many have 
showed up on campus yet. but as one starry eyed individual commented 
there can never be TOO many. It is sort of funny when you think about it. 
thoufih because these outfits have been around the roller rinks for years 
Except for the pantyhose liolpants are just short-shorts without wheels.lt 
is good to note that all the money the girls saved by not allowing themselves 
to be swayed by the Madison Avenue Fashion Dictators and their Midi 
skirt fad. Is now being wisely invested in Hotpants. It shows that our girls 
arc independent and have well-developed minds. ...as well. 

Some girls, though would be better advised to refrain from wearing 
Hotpants -they are not for everybody, por example, one girl I saw wearing 
them was so homely that her Hotpants were hard put just trying to reach room 
icniperature Another girl was so skinny th»t her thighs were black and 
blue from her Hotpants legs flapping in the breeze One pair 1 saw very 
nearly cost me my life. I was in the toy section of a local department store 
when I saw a fat lady in hotpants. She was bent over tying her shoe, and I 
mistook her tor a pair of giant Klackers You know lor a fat lady, she sure

Firemen used a torch to free him. 



At bottom, police lower him to a 
stretcher as he grimaces in pain. 
He was later adiAitled to Lutheran 
Hospital in serious condition with 
multiple cuts and bruises." 

In truth, then, the police of- 
ficers pictured HAVE NOT beaten, 
subdued, or arrested the young man; 
they have rescued him from a 
wrecked automobile, thereby likely 
saving his life. 

As it appears in the Commu- 
nicator, the photograph constitutes 
a gross misrepresentation of fact 
to a degree which is remiscenl of 
the days of "yellow faunaHstL," 
The use of the picture is not merely 
distortion of the truth; rather, it is a 
deliberate and total disregard for 
the truth. Such practices constitute 
the lowest from of journalism. 

Ironically, this fabrication 
comes from a publication allegedly 
dedicated to the nparHitg of the 
clear and objective truth. The pre- 
sentation and interpretation of facta 
objectively, without bias or dis- 
tortion, is of paramount importance 
in all areas of journalism; indeed, 
such practices are necessary if this 
nation is to maintain a truly free 
press. Apparently, however, such 
practices are not of great impor- 
tance to the editor and staff of the 

If the misleading manner in 
which the photo of Stephen Snyder 
was presented is an indication of 
normal practices and procedures, 
then it must be assumed that the 
Communicator is riot actually a free 
press; perhaps "All the news that's 
fit to print" has become "All the 
news that pts, we prinL" 

The Communicator has ma- 
ligned the Fort Wayne police dc' 



parlnent, and the implications that 
Mr. Snyder is guilty of disorderly 
conduct and is being arretted bor- 
der an the libelous. Moreover, the 
Communicator has committed a 
grave injustice to those who wish 
to know the truth before taking 
sides. 

For the sake of truth and the 
reputation of the I.U. -Purdue Com- 
municator, one hopes that ikt fV' 
lies responsible for printing the 
photo in the manner in which it was 
presented will step forward and 



make themselves known. Such pub- 
lication of the photograph is (oo 
deliberate an effort to be ignored 
or quietly glossed over as merely a 

It is in the interest of fair and 
responsible journalism that I 4o*« 
composed this letter. I only hope 
that the staff of the Communicator 
will moke efforts to rectify and 
amend the situation in keeping 
withlhese ideas. 

Yours truly,

be true, he UHid, "fur a student

Open house committee in session 



Dean Manges, of Purdue Uni- 
versity and Chancellor Ralph 
Broyles of Indiana announces a 
committee for the open house to 
be scheduled this spring. How- 
ever due to lach of lime and a 
very full schedule, no date for an 
open house was set. Committee 
members Andy Harper. Mr. Harper, 
of Ihe Speech Dept,, Oewayne 
Stonebarger. John Gorgone, Shel- 
don Gottlieb, David Cnwood. Wil- 
lard Hart, Helen Lee. Slyvia 
Bowman. Charles Sharp, and Don 
McAleece decided that the open 
house would be postponed until 
the fall, this giving students and 
faculty enough time to get in- 

The type of open house has 
not been decided yet. There are 
three possibilities, and they are: 
(I) when the high school students 
come in and Inspect the buildings, 
grounds, etc. with a program 
telling of the necessary informa- 
tion one might want to know about 
the school; (2) when the guidance 
councelors and principals come 
in and learn about the types of 
programs offered by I.U.-P.U.: and 



(3) when the townspeople and 
parents come in and inspect the 
grounds and learn a bit about the 
campus, as was the type that was 
presented last year. As there is 
no defrnate plan, the committee 
will welcome suggestions.
