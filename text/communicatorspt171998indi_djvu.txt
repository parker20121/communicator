Rushing provides many benefits 



SiaffWniir 

The Pi Beta Phi and Delia Gainma 
sororiiics began ihe main ponion of ihcir 
new member program wilh a rush orienta- 
(ion pany on Sunday. Scpi. 13. and another 
on Tuesday. Sept. 15. 

These panics were a chance for inicrcsi- 
cd girls to gel to know the pledges and 
become familiar wilh sorority life. 

Don't worry if you missed these evenLs 
because visitors are welcome in Walb 210. 

TTicre arc two fraternities on campus, 
Sigma Phi Epsilon and Phi Kappa Thela. 

Main rush ha.^ passed, but but on 
Wednesdays at 9 p.m., the Phi Kappa Theias 
bowl at Brunswick Lanes. Thursday nights 
they watch movies in their office. 

All are welcome. 

Both fniiemilics encourage (hose inier- 



eslcd to stop by ilieir offices a.s well. 

The Sigma Phi Epsilons arc looking for 
"well-rounded people with prospects for 
success," said Scott LazolT. vice president. 

The group's motto is "Building a 
Balanced Man." 

The rratcmiiy was founded in 1901 and 
is now the largest and longest-standing in 
the country with another 220.000 members 
nationally, 25 of tha';e currently belonging 
to the IPFW chapter. 

This chapter has always been involved 
in community service, and has recently 
helped the Community Harvest Food Bank 
and the Rescue Mission. They also recently 
promoted a project to build playgrounds for 
kids, designed by kids. 

The Phi Kappa Thetas help with [he 
canned food drives at Komet games. 
Lutheran Hospice House, and fundraisers 
for various charities. Their motto is "Give, 
Expecting Nothing Thereof." 



■'There are over 100 Phi Kappa Theia 
chapters nationally, and 20 guys in this one. 
If you meet us, all stereotypes of fraternity 
members will be defeated." said Kurt 
Fremion, president. 

The Delta Gammas and the Pi Beta Phis 
are "panhellenic." meaning they can't exist 
on a campus without another sorority. 

Both are looking for girls with good 
scholarship, who are involved, and who 
have positive altitudes. 

Their purpose is to help girls do well in 
college 

"We're just a big family," said Bedi 
McConncll, Delta Gamma president. 

The Delta Gammas have meetings 
every Sunday in their office in Walb 210, a 
public party every semester, and a formal 
dance for members. 

They also help with many charities that 
aid the blind. 

This year they plan to raise charity 




money with their anno.il 
Eastetegg hunt and by cell- 
ing "Yankee Doodle No&lt;hJ1i.- 
Necklaces" at The Johnny 
Applesced Festival. 

Tliey have estabhshed 
141 chapters since their 
foundation in 1873. and 
have 25 in the IPFW 
chapter. 

Their motto is "Sisters 
by Chance. Friends by 
Choice." 

The Pi Beta Phis are 
proud to be the first sorority 
established in the United Slates. ' *"^y ^'^^ help fund a school of aris and 

There are only 13 members in iheir '^^f'^ thai benefits underprivileged citi);cns

Help teach a 
child to read 



Chief Reporter 

Over .12,000 people in Allen county alone 
struggle wilh basic reading skills, mainly because 
they never acquired them as a child. 

The Indiana Reading Corps (IRC) division ai 
IPFW, now beginning its second year, works to 
help area children improve reading skills and 
abilily. 

"Children lliat don't know how 10 read can't 
succeed in school." Program Coordinator Julie 
Newcomer said, "If we want to sec children make 
it 10 a college level, they have 10 be able 10 read." 
Tlic program facilitates to second grade stu- 
dents, twice a week, in one-hour sessions of per- 
sonal tutoring by an IPFW student. 

The children arc selected from area schools by 
their teachers, primarily when die children an; 
reading about one grade level below die average 
reading level for their age. 

Tn first grade, children are still learning and it 
is hard to access their reading ability," Newcomer 
said. "Second grade is an ideal age because they 
still love school and are still wanting to read." 

IPFW students who volunieer with IRC are 
asked to make a one-semester conunitmeni and the 
child being lulored must stay for the semester, ton 
Slaying for one year, however, makes the most dif- 
ference in supporting the child's growih and devel- 
opment in Ie;iming. 

"My main concern is, of course, 10 increase 
dielr reading abilities, but also to expose the child 
10 quality litera- 
ture and by doing 
so change their 
attitude towards 
reading." 
Newcomer said. 
"This way, when 
they get to school 
they are ready to 
gel down to busi- 
ness and learn," 

Last year, the 
program was able 
to tutor about 43 
students, mostly 
from Fori Wayne Community Schools. 

Though there arc many morc students who 
could benefit from die program, volunteer num- 
bers must first increase. 

"I would love ii if by spring we could get two 
groups of tutoring going," Newcomer said. "I'd 
like lo increase to 50 volunteers and have not only 
Tuesday and Thursday night sessions, but one on 
Monday and Wednesday nights, as well." 

Coming up on Thursday, Sept. 24, at 7:30 
p.m., Borders bookstore and the IPFW University 
baseball team will be hosting die "Last Days of 
Summer" fundraiser, of which all proceeds will go 
to IPFW's division of Ihe IRC. 

Combo meals including hot dogs, chips, and a 
drink for S3 will be available and ihere will also be 
a reading from Steven Kluger's book, "The La.st 
Days of Summer," and a chance to win books and 
other pri/es.

Science Central and IPFW team up 



by Carrie Anne Leulhers 



With the help of IPF"W professors, 
Science Central is once again offering 
"Lunch With a Scientist," a monthly pro- 
gram geared towards teaching children 
about different topics in science. 

"Tliis program gets general visitors to 
see some of the things ihat professors and 
their professions provide." said Louis 
Papai, programs assistant for Science 
Central. 

"Kids sometimes say, 'I cim't do 
that!' so they tunc it out. One of the main 
purposes of diese sessions is to bring die 
subject down to the kids' level and pur- 
pose, so that they can see how ii works in 
die real world." said Papai. 

The sessions began last Saturday with 
a demonstration and discussion on "The 
Wonder of Water," by Art Friedel. profes- 
sor of chemistry. Children, accompanied 
by their parenLs, learned about surface 
tension and odier undioughi of aspects of 
water. 

"I wanted to teach dwm that water is 
a very special substance: it's the only sub- 
stance that I know of in which the solid 
will Hoat in its own liquid." Friedel said. 
"I've t&gt;een working widi kids for 40 years 
and in this kind of setting it's wonderful." 



Upcoming sessions will feature a 
range of subjects, including cloning. 
eardiquakes. and endangered reptiles. 

According to Papai. the topics were 
chosen based on what special area in sci- 
ence each professor could share, 

"Staff members sat down and looked 
at the professors at IPFW and what fun 
diings they could do related to their 
knowledge in science." Papai said. "Last 
year our sessions sold out so we are very 
excited about this year." 

Associate Professor of Biology Bruce 
Kingsbury will be giving his presentation 
on "The Endangered Reptiles" on Dec. 
12, 

He has past experience working with 
bolh Science Central and groups of school 
children. 

"Ii is a community service dial I enjoy 
doing, and I also hope diat it inOuenccs 
die ki±s' views on die environment and 
cducadon," Kingsbury said. "1 think that 
it is also good for the university, because 
it shows the community who we are and 
diat we can be a resource." 

He plans to have a slide show and also 
an inieracdve discussion. Becau.se the siM 
limii wilt keep the group fairly small. 
Kingsbury believes that a lot of discus- 
sion will be possible. 

"The kids really like the extracurricu- 
lar aspect of these sons of activities," 
Kingsbury said, "These are also some- 



what preselected kids as well, in that they 
already have an interest in science." 

Besides just the session which the 
kids attend, they will also be able to spend 
as much time before or after the session, 
walking around Science Central. 

"If a person wants to do just one ses- 
sion, they pay for the series ahead of time 
and included in that session diey are wel- 
come to play on the exhibit," Papai said. 
"ll'd be great if they decide to slay for the 
day." 

Science Cenu'al has been open since 
1995. 

Before Uiis, it was mainly an orga- 
nized group of teachers thai wanted to 
share .science widi area students. 

"In 1990, diey hired somebody to 
generate money and open a building." 
Papai said, "Teachers fell thai hands-on 
learning was a good way to teach students 
about science." 

After each session is over, those in 
attendance will be provided with lunch 
and an informal chance to sit and talk widn 
the professors. 

The cost for the sessions goes direcdy 
back into the program. 

Each session costs SIO, or S5 for 
Science Central members. 

Those interested in registering should 
call Science Central at 424-2400.

In these instances Ihe Literary 
Alliance provides one-on-one tutors and

work with diem loward shon-ierm and 
long-term goals for free. 

Books and any other materials are

Reading books to their children is a big 
one," said Julie Baka, program assistant.

Edilorial" Ihis semesier. 



FINANCIAL AID 

Problems with the finan- 
ci al aid syste m were 
brought up in the first issue 
of the fall semester. 

To refresh your memory, 
we gave you examples of 
two students of the many 
thai we have talked to ahoul 
problems with financial aid. 

Remember, there is only 
so much room on the page, 
therefore we could only 
give two examples. 

In the case of Student 
ffl. he is yet to have 
received any type of fund- 
ing from the Financial Aid 
Office. 

He has called the num- 
bers the office gave him, 
and it seems as though 
IPFW is no longer listed to 
receive the information 
from his FAFSA. 

On the other hand, we 



"Better mad with the rest of 
the world than wise alone." 

-Baltasar Gracian 



are proud to report 
that Student #2 has 
received her finan- 
cial aid and is very 
content w'th how 
things have finally 
turned out for her. 

It just goes to 
show that things 
always turn out dif- 
ferently for some 
people, but the story 
isn't finished until 
Student #1 gels his 
aid. 

PRINCESS Dl AND 
OTHER DEAD 
PEOPLE 

We're proud to 
report that all of the 
people mentioned in 
our editorial have 
not risen from the 
dead, and still (as far 
as we know) are 
buried in their 
respective graves. 

We are also sad to see 
that George Wallace passed 
away last week and that he 
was given only four min- 
utes of air time on some 
cable stations. 

The last new Princess Di 
product that we have found 
is a tub of margarine that 
depicts a likeness of Di. 

Unfortunately, we arc 
sorry to report that we did 




not receive any orders for 
our Princess Di beach balls, 
a real bargain at S12.99. 

PARKING 

In the last issue we 
brought up the parking 
problems here on campus. 
Unfortunately, very little 
has changed with the park- 
ing situation. 

There are still rows of 
metered parking in the 



garages that just sit empty 
and make those of us look- 
ing for prime parking space 
a little upset. 

The same pretty much 
goes for A permit parking. 

It hasn't changed and at 
no time during the week 
have we seen it full in too 
many areas. 

Why should we even 
bother in bringing these 



by Denny She, Edrtorlal Cartoonist 

things up again? 

We feel that you should 
be informed and updated on 
the events that have taken 
place since the editorial has 
been published. 

One of the most difficult 
things is to begin a story 
and cut it off midstream 
because all of the elements 
haven't played out. 



What's Weak this Week 



by Dennis Donahue 
Columnist 



I have the influenza virus 
right now, better known as 
"the Flu," Not just a stuffy 
nose, sionvach ihingub.ui a 
full-blown, butt-klckinf; in 
your face, stay home from 
work, dry heaves kinda' flu, 
1 skipped all of my classes 
last Thursday. 1 never miss 
classes either; it's just a per- 
sonal thing-l feel too guilty 
when I skip. I mean. I've 
already paid for if, I might as 
well show up. I probably 
could have made it to class, 
but there was no reason to 
get any of you guys sick. I 
hope you are as considerate 
when you get sick. Don't 
come to school. Stay home 
and watch the talk shows. 
Today I watched the Cubs 
lose, bummer. 

I probably get sick twice 
a year, if that. The first time 
is right around my birthday 
(last week), and sometimes 
over Christmas break. I 
blame it on lack of nutrition. 
and the fact that Labor Day 
weekend is the official end 
of summer. Maybe it is 



because school is beginning 
and I start to stress out a lit- 
tle bit more than normal. 
Christmas time, well, I just 
blame it on the fact Ihat 
everyone else is sick, I'm 
just in line. Getting sick is 
no fun. I get more cranky 
than normal, and I'm hard to 
be around. 

That is one of the reasons 
that I didn't go to work or 
school last week. I was feel- 
ing nasty, and I wanted 
everyone to know. By the 
way, I really was sick. My 
body ached, I had a head full 
of mucous, I was coughing, I 
had a mean headache, and 
for three or four days, 1 had a 
Coricidin/NyQuil buzz. I 
couldn't even concentrate as 
I drove to Walgreen's for the 
millionth time, as I kept for- 
getting things I needed. I 
rented Good Will Hunting, 
but had to watch it three 
times because I kept falling 
asleep. It's a pretty good 
movie. 1 think. 

I think I first noticed I 
was feeling bad on Tuesday 



night during my soft ball 
games, 1 had a scratchy 
throat, but I figured it would 
go away. I woke up on 
Wednesday and knew ihat I 
was going to be sick. I just 
had that feeling, I tried to 
'nip it in the bud' by eating a 
bunch of vitamins, but it was 
too late. I went to work Ihat 
day. and after lunch. ! had 
some minor symptoms. After 
work I felt pretty good, tike 
it was just a 24-hour thing. 
Cool, I ' m going lo be 
alright. 

That night, a bunch of us 
went to the Wizards playoff 
game. It was 50 cent 
Budweiser night. Let's just 
say that we got our money's 
worth. It was a beautiful 
night for a ballgame. But I 
don't think I dressed appro- 
priately. I woke Thursday 
and felt crappy, real crappy. I 
had muscle aches, a 
headache, and 1 couldn't 
even keep toast down. It 
wasn't a hangover either; I 
know what a hangover Is. A 
little advice to all of you

drinkers; don't party if you 
feel even the sitghlesi bit of 
sickness coming on. 1 think 
it just amplifies the virus. 

It is now Sunday and I'm 
feeling a million times bet- 
ter. The Cubs have won two 
games in a row in their last 
at bat. and 1 spent the after- 
noon watching the game and 
reading homework, 1 didn't 
get much done except for 
during commercials and 
pitching changes. I think I'll 
get a flu shot this year for 
the first time ever. I owe it to 
myself, my employers and to 
my almost perfect attendance 
here at school. I guess they 
only cost Tive bucks so it is 
probably worth it. 

But enough about me. 
How are all of YOU feeling? 
We are getting into the 
fourth week of school and 
the first tests are going to be 
given during the next few 
weeks. I think I have two 
next week, what a drag. I'm 
really glad that so far this 
has been a peaceful year. 
Parking is still a problem. 



but it always will be. The 
problem is, we are so lazy 
that we hate parking away 
from where our classes are. 
You might as well enjoy the 
walk because it will be cold 
in about a month. I park 
near... wait; I'm not giving 
away my secret spot. 

Our little "threat" prob- 
lem hasn't reared its ugly 
head this year. Thanks for 
behaving, all of you. keep it 
up. And once again, my 
thanks to all of the law 
enforcement agencies, espe- 
cially the IPFW Police, that 
arrested the two kids last 
year. They got off easy, but 
now they have a police 
record, I've noticed that 
campus crime is down also. 
If you don't want people to 
break into your car. lock it. 
Also, put your stuff in the 
trunk, or somewhere it won't 
be seen. Above all, use com- 
mon sense. 

So I hope everyone is set- 
tling in okay. Remember that 
there is a lot of help out 
there if you need it. I think 



we have a men's soccer and 
baseball game this Saturday, 
Support your athletic pro- 
grams. I can't say it enough. 
I'll be in many events this 
year. Use it as a social out- 
ing, a place to meet people. 

Loser of the Week- This 
week has been a difficult one 
for the Office of the 
President of the United 
States. I blame Monica, Ken 
and Bill for embarrassing 
our nation. We need to get 
over it. Let the guy finish his 
term. He isn't doing a bad 
job. Republicans are so 
quick to criticize. Party affil- 
iation and pride is one thing, 
hut taking down the 
President is serious. For 
every bad politician, there 
are bad people behind him or 
her. If you think Gore can do 
Ihe job better, then go ahead 
and impeach Clinton. If not, 
then SHUT UP! This is the 
last time I'll even mention it. 
Have a great weekend, be 
nice. Go Cubbies!

Everyday Epiphanies 



by Gail Ruble-Crawford 
Editor 



Fear has the largest eyes of all 



"Fear has many things and 
can see underground," 

Miguel de Cervantes 

"If something makes me 
uncomfortable, or scares 
me, I have to surround 
myself with It and get to 
understand its shape. 
Then it can 't affect me, " 

David Wojnarowicz 

"Decisiveness Is often the 
art of timely cruelty," 

Henry Becque 



We've all tell tear at one lime 
Of another. I'm not talking about 
Ihie fear Ifiai some freaky 
stranger is going to attack you as 
you walk to your car lale al niglit. 
I'm talking about Itie other kind 
ol tear that we're all victims of al 
one time or another: Fear of the 
future 

I've been on a kick thal's 
caused me lo question things lor 



a few years now. 

As a result of my soul- 
searching, I've made many dea- 
sions that have changed my lite 

Now, however, I've reached 
that part of "personal growth" 
where I'm making some pretty 
heavy choices. 

My latest big-ticket decisions 
dealt with graduate school and 
having a baby 

I decided to go to graduate 
school and I decided that I'm 
ready to have a baby. 

'If you're gonna go, go all- 
out." right? 

I'm happy with my decisions, 
and I'm excited about where 
Ihose choices will take me. 

However, as greal as those 
prospects are, the excitement 
that accompanies them also 
brings out my innate fear ol 
failure. 

It's one thing to make huge 
choices in life. 

Thai's not such a lough thing 
lo do, unless you're an extreme- 
ly indecisive person; then it's 
tantamount to a jaunt through 



Hell. 

The pari that's not so easy is 
dealing with all of the insecurities 
that we all have hidden way, 
deep-down, inside 

Those little "I'm-nol-so-sure- 
I,,.." thoughts begin to leak out 
when' you confront yourself with 
your fears head-on. 

In my case, I've begun to 
panic. I wonder if I'll be a good 
parent. 

I sometimes wonder if 1 can 
take ihe rigors ot grad school 
while being a mother. 

In other words, I'm (enified 
thai I'll make some wrong choice 
at some poinl that will make me 
screw up my lite, or my child's 
lite, for that matter. 

I'm just afraid. Thai's all there 
IS lo 11 

And much as you'd like lo 
hide it, you've probably felt the 
same way al some point in lime 
Who hasn'1? I'd be lying lo say 
thai I haven't been in Ihis posi- 
tion before. 

Every big decision or change 
in life presents new opportunities 



for those Utile 'inner 
fears' to escape and be 
given life. My womes are 
made much wor^e by Ihe 
simple fad that I'm a 
bom worrier anyway. 

I've lain awake night 
after night pondering 
these imagined cnses of 
Ihe future- 
Fear is an awfully good way 
lo begin second-guessing your- 
self. 

It makes me not trust myself 
and my own decisions lime and 
time again. 

I'm not loo sure about you, 
but I hate to not trust myself. It's 
disconcerting, and I'm not a per- 
son who likes to be unsure of 
myself all that often. 

I don't know, maybe fear isn't 
such a bad thing. But it sure is a 
tough thing to overtook. 

I have leamed one thing, 
however Tigunng out how to deal 
with the things that I'm afraid of 
makes me stronger. 

Once I gel to the heart of 
what I'm afraid of, I take away 




that fear's ability to run my life 

Then it can't hurt me any- 
more. Such realizations don't 
exactly make me wiser or any- 
thing, but they make me under- 
stand what's inside me and why 
I fear what I fear. 

I don't know it I'll be the 
world's best or worsl mother. I 
don't know if my child will resent 
the importance thai getting a 
master's degree means to me. 

All I know is this: I'm just 
going lo keep on doing things the 
best way I know how, and I'll love 
my child with all of my heart and 
soul. 

That is something that I know 
I'll get right, even if I don't do 
anything else right In my life.

-''"'■'People' who are interested m

Borders bookstore fundraiser," 
Newcomer said. "The proceeds go 
back to IRC lo buy books and then 
the children being tutored get lo 
keep the books ihcy read (during the 
tuioring sessions)." 



Studies have shown that rtiiding 
abilities play a crucial rule in a 
child's development, as well as that 
of die community. 

In a report by Mayor Paul 
Helmke's Reading Commission, il is 
stressed thai communities in Fort

volunteering with IRC had many 
additional benefits for ihe

The children Uiai come out of 
such a personiil training as IRC

"i think that anytime you work 
with a child there are so many 
rewards," Newcomer said. "The

Elusive Destiny: 'Realizations' 



Features Editor 

Feeling claiciJ. Tim walked inio 
his apartmcni wjih a smile and put 
ajioiher ease of beer in ihc refriger- 
aior 

As he grabbed a colder can and 
shul the rcfrigernior door, he heard 
ihe water running in the bathroom. 
Quietly he hid nexl to the door, 
awaiting Ihc occupant of the 
rcsiroom as the water shut off. 

As his friend Mark opened the 
door and walked oul of the bath- 
room, Tim jumped him from behind 
and wrestled him to the ground. 

"What's gotten into you, man?" 
Mark asked as he picked himself up 
frum the ground. "Musi'vc been a 
good day," 

"Mark, man. I think I'm in love," 
Tim said as he flopped down on the 
couch. 

"Aww," Mark replied. "When are 
wc gcitin' married, sweetie'.'" 

"Shut up, moron. I'm laJkin' 
about dial girl 1 work with." 

"Didn't push all die work oft on 
ya, huh?" Mark chuckled. "Did you 
ask her out yet?" 

"Belter dian Uiat, we went out 
already. Went down to the pub for a 
beer after work." 

"Oh yeah? Mow far did you get 
with her?" 

"Man. I ain't even ihinkin" about 
d)at. All I could think about was get- 
tin' to know more about her. She's 
from California originally but 
mo\'cd here from Iowa. The more I 
talked to her. die more I found out 
what wc had in common. Kinda 
sciuy. actually... never met a girl like 
thai before." 

"Beach babe turned brain, ya 
gotta love that," Mark said with a 
grin. "And you work with her, huh? 
Do you work alone wiih her?" '&lt; 
"What's it matter?" Tun replied 
defensively. 

"I don't know, I'm just trying to 
act interested. Ask her out to dinner 
Uiis weekend if you're that hung up 
on her." 

'Think I will," Tim said widi a 
far off look on his face. "I diink I'm 
gonna do it." 

"Then slop talking about it and 
do it, you idiot." Mark threw a pil- 
low at Tim in mid-drink, causing 
Tim to spill beer all over his shin. 

As the two fought their liiUe 
skirmish, Tim couldn't help hul feel 
like a kid again. 

In a little house just outside of 
town, the sunset found Michelle sit- 
ting on her front porch swing with a 
glass of water and a portable phone 
at her side. 



Today was considenibly better. 
she diought to herself, as die night 
bugs picked up their orchestra. 

She'd gotten a lot done ai work, 
mostly because of Tim's help, and 
she was finally able to relax again 
knowing that tomorrow should go 
just as easy. 

Despite her comfort, though, 
she felt an unsettling feeling deep 
inside that she couldn't quite place a 
finger on. 

She'd felt that way since die 
drive home after her little recre- 
ational meeting 
with Tim at the 
bar and she did- 
n't know why. 

Tun seemed 
like a nice guy 
initially, han- 
dling himself 
widi dignity and 
prestige. 

There was 
something about 
him. though, 
that reminded 
her of her ex- 
boyfriend 
Aaron. 

Aaron, she 
rcficcted, had at 
one time been 
the same way. 

He was very 
profound, well- 
mannered, and 
was always 
quick with a 
compliment. 

Me changed 
in time, diough. 
Me began drink- 
ing regularly 
and spent less 
and less time widi her as the rela- 
tionship drew on. 

As the relationship evolved. 
Aaron's charm and personality 
diminished and she soon forgot how 
great he was. 

Aaron, however, is out of her life 
now. He's just some jerk who lives 
in the city dial she no longer has to 
put up with. 

He doesn't live in her house, 
and he doesn't work at her office. 
He's out for good. 

Tun, though, does work at her 
office, and despite how great she 
feels when she's around him. what 
happens if Tim turns out like 
Aaron? 

She'd have to put up widi him 
every day then. 

She'd be around him a third of 
her day, every day, for as long as 
diey boUi still worked logcdier. 

That was something she didn't 
diink she could handle. 



Being around him every day did- 
n't really sound that bad right now. 
She could probably handle it as 
long as she didn't get too close to 
him. 

After all, the more you get to 
know someone tlie more you find 
wrong with them. 

They could be friendi., but that's 
it. - nothing more, nothing less. 

Feeling sadsfied with her deci- 
sion about the relationship, 
Michelle grabbed her water and die 
telephone and went in to watch die 

news. 

With 
that oul of 
the way, she 
felt confi- 
dent she 
could handle 
facing him 
again in die 
morning 
with a smile. 
She was cer- 
ta i n she 
knew what 
she wanted 
from him 



"He went over and 

over things in his 
head, searching for 
the right ice breat&lt;er 

that v^ould set up 

Vi/hot he had in mind, 

only to come up with 

nothing," 



absolutely 
nothing. 

The new 
day found 
Tim awake 
just a little 
earlier Ulan 
the previous 
day had. 

He was 
feeling great 
today and 
really didn't 
know why. 
T h e 
birds never sang so nice, the sun 
never smiled so bright, and the sky 
couldn't have been bluer as .he set. 
out in g.t)jinw.oik,thal ranmirtg-.A 

Traffic was heavy, but he didn't 
even notice. 

During the entire trip to work 
all he concerned himself with was 
findmg die right opportunity to a.sk 
Michelle to dinner diat weekend. 

Me went over and over things in 
his head, searching for the right ice 
breaker dial would set up what he 
had in mind, only to come up with 
nodiing. 

Me finally resolved that he 
would let die moment set itself up 
and that just being with her that day 
would be good enough, in ca.se the 
opportunity didn't present itself. 

He would live another day to 

ask her. he figured, and there was no 

reason to get all worked up about it. 

Me arrived at work in the same 

good mood he'd set out widi from 



his apartment. 

Michelle was already inside, 
fixing a pot of coffee to gel things 
going widi an early start. 

They casually greeted each 
other and sat down to get to work, 
bodi careful to hide the emotions 
diey had put each odicr through 
since last diey saw each odier. 

After a busy day, Michelle 
packed up her papers, said goodbye 
to Tim, and headed for the door. 

Widiout even diinking, Tim 
stopped her as she was opening the 
door. 

"Hey, wait a second. What are 
your plans for diis weekend?" Tim 
bluned out, catching Michelle off 
guard. 

"Nodiing yet, whyT' Michelle 
responded, knowing full well what 
Tun was going to say next. 

"I was diinking maybe we could 
get togedier Saturday and get some- 
thing to cat," Tim confidently 
relumed. 

"I'm sorry. Tim, but I'm not 
looking for that with you. Don' t for- 
get to turn out the lights before you 
leave, okay? I'll see you tomorrow." 
Not quite sure what had just hap- 
pened, Tim stared at die door and 
tried to Stan thinking again. 

Recovering somewhat from the 
shock of being rejected, he packed 
up his diings and headed home. 

Walking in the door of his apart- 
ment, he brushed past Mark on his 
way out die door. "When do we 
order the invitations to the wed- 
ding?" Mark said widi a .smile. 

"Leave me alone. Mark, Go get 
drunk or something." Tim said as he 
slammed the door to his room. 

Tonight was going to be a long 
night.

Page calls for work towards racial harmony 



by KIndra Childress 



Staff Wriler 

The Hrsi lecture in ihc Omnibus Lecture 
Scries was given by Clarence Page Sept. 9. 
at 7:30 p.m., in the Walb Union Ballroom. 

The Icciure was preceded by a news 
conference at 3:30 p.m. 

Media sponsors included WBNI 89.1 
FM. WJFX 107.9 FM, and News Channel 
15- 

Pagc has been called "one of ihc flinii- 
csL most pa&amp;sion.iie writers on race in 
America." Me is a 1965 graduate of 
MidJIciown High School in Middleiown, 
Ohio. 

In Middleiown. Page began his journal- 
ism career ai age 17 as a freelance writer 
and photographer for the Middlctown 
Journal and The Cincinnati Enquirer. 

Page received a bachelor of arts in jour- 
nalism from Ohio University in 1969 and 
has received honorary doctorates from 
Columbia College Chicago and Lake Forest 
College (in Illinois). 

He is Ihc author of the recently published 
book "Showing My Color Impolite Essays 
on Race and Identity." 

In 1989. Page won a Pulitzer Prize for 
commentary and has been a widely syndi- 
cated columnist and member of the Chicago 
Tribune's editorial board sine 1984. 

His published articles have appeared in 
numerous magazines and newspapers. 
including Chicago Magazine, New 



Republic, and the Wall Street Journal, 
He is a regular commentator on This Week 
With Sam Donaldson and Cokie Robens. 
The McLaughlin Group, The Newshour 
with Jim Leber, Black Entenainmeni 
TclevLSion's Lead Story, and NPR's Sunday 
Morning Eklilion. 

He is also a frequent guest on Nighdine. 
Good Morning America, Today, and CNN. 

Page has received numerous awards for 
investigative Journalism and writings on 
civil libenies and constitutional rights. 

In 1992 Page was inducted into die 
Chicago Journalism Hall of Fame. 

In his leciurc, enlillcd "Race Relations 
for the New Millennium." Page says 
America will have lo go "through" race to 
get "beyond" race. 

The main topic of the lecture is affirma- 
tive action There is a study in the book 
'"The Shape of the River" regarding race 
and admissions to colleges and universities. 

"The Shape of the River" is written by 
Derek Bok, retired president of Harvard 
University and William G. Bowen. former 
president of Princeton University. 

The sludy puts a positive spin on affir- 
mative action and the admissions process. 

Page's view on the Affirmalive Action 
program is that it is a tool for a means to an 
end. the end being an eg^iiariati society. 

Affirmative action may be a very 
imperfect tool, but it is die best tool we 
have, said Page. 

It has benefitted both black and while 
studenLs and has improved the quality of life 
for boUi. 



It is also responsible for creating the 
new black middle class. Page has an opti- 
mistic \icw on race relations in die 21st 
Cenlury. 

He says the civil rights movement is a 
small section of a much larger human righLs 



Page says many while Americans diink 
blacks "have it easy" and can make it as 
well as whites as long as ihcy have a good 
education, 

Ttic fact is. he added, blacks are still 
more likely to be stopped by police and to 
he suspects in crimes. 

Page told a story of how a real astatc 
agent who was showmg their house told 
him and his wife to remove all anifacts of 
black hLsiory from view if they wanted to 
sell it. 

This included all family photos, the 
Kwanza calendar, and all books about black 
history. 

The explanation was that many whites 
will not buy a house they know has or has 
had blacks living in it. 

Page says most segregation is in the 
workplace. After work, everyone goes their 
separate ways lo their separate lives. Racial 
segregation is more common in bigger 
cities than small towns. 

In small towns, everyone talks to each 
other because everyone knows each other. 
In larger towns and cities people don't talk 
as much. 

We diink we know each odier until a 
racial eruption occurs, such as the Waits 
RioLs and the afiemnadi of the O. J, Simpson 



verdict. 

Page also stated die U. S, census is think- 
ing of adding anew check off boji for race. 
Page compared die U. S. census to those of 
Brazil and Mexico 

In Brazil a black man asked what he 
calls himself will reply one of 45 dilTercnt 
answers depending on the shade of his skin. 

However, in Mexico, the racial boxes 
on the census were eliminated in the 1920s 
because race officially ceased to matter in 
their society. 

Page was asked his opinion on many top- 
ics. One was "What was the journalist's role 
in race relations?" Page answered diat jour- 
nalists need to be part of the "solution" and 
not pan of die "problem." 

Journalists need to have more sensitivi- 
ty in covering racial issues. Most of the 
crimes covered by journalists are those of 
blacks and Latinos. 

Page says it is important not to give 
mLsconceptioas about social problems, 

Anodier question was "What is the role 
of humor in race relations? " Page answered 
humor is very important; we all need to be 
careful we do not become overly sensitive, 
he added. 

Page was asked about the Clinton and 
Lewinsky issue while Kenneth Starr's 
report was being sent to Capitol Hill in hun- 
dreds of pages. 

Page believes die report will eventually 
be made public, but first there will be many 
leaks and partial repons. 

He commented on the big credibility 
gap of the presidency. 



Page says he believes President Clinton 
will get a slap on the wrist rather than a full 
impeachment hearing. 

Page also believes the matter will not be 
dealt with before the congrcs.siona] elec- 
tions in November, 

Republican leaders want to avoid action 
because the majority of Americans are 
happy with Democratic control of the White 
House and how the economy is doing so 
well, along with the low crime talc. 

Democratic leaders want to put all of 
the scandal behind Uicm before die elec- 
tions, so diey'U likely seek a quick end to 
die situation. 

On a lighter note, Page was asked if he 
diought Sammy Sosa could overtake Mark 
McGwire in the "homerun chase." 

Page replied it is quite possible, and 
since he works for the Chicago Tribune 
(which is owned by the same company that 
owns the Cubs) all he could say was "Go 
Sosa!" 

One of die final thoughts Clarence Page 
left us widi is we all need to work together 
to make the country a "more perfect union," 
as stated in the Constitution. 

We all need to a.sk ourselves "How 
much arc we willing to give? How much 
pain arc we willing to endure?" 

The next Omnibus Lecture will be 
Monday. Oct. 19, at 7:30 p.m. in the Walb 
Student Union Dalhoom. 

The lecturer will be artist, writer, and 
feminist Judy Chicago. 



Chase Leo, Sink Titanic: 

Web entertainment for the bored student 



Staff Writer 

Trying to find a good way to 
pass the time in between cla.sses can 
be very frustrating. 

I have experienced those time 
spaces between classes when it 
seems too long to stay on campus. 
I Yet. it's absolutely pointless to 
go home, only to return an hour 
later. 

Here are a few web sites I have 
found to be the best at just wasting 
time. 

In fact, widi some of these sites. 
it's too addictive to let go. 

First off, I have a web site for 
thasc who wear contact lenses. 

That site is http;//www. 
Iensquesl.com, fhis site includes 
some incredibly exotic lenses. 

When you enter the web site, 
click "Custom tinted &amp; special 
effect lenses." 

Some of the lenses include cat 
eyes, stars and moons, white eyes, 
and even an 8-ball, 

However, 1 was disappointed 
that widi all of die choices, they 
didn't have a smiley face contact 
lens. 

It would be a good idea to have 



some form of use for these lenses, 
because Uiey cost between SlOO to 
S200. 

An application I can ah'eady 
diink of is for an athlete to psyche 
out his opponent. Imagine what 
your opponent would be diinking if 
you showed up ready to go widi 
your "cat eyes" on. 

My next site owns die bragging 
rights as the large.si online database | 
in the world; hltp://www.Ur- 
raserver.com. This web site is 
owned by Microsoft. 

Real surprising, isn't it? The 
Tcrraserver has about 1.01 
terrabytes of info. 

Don't worry if you don't know 
what a terrabyte is This Itkely will 
not be coming to personal comput- 
ers for a long while 

Basically one terrabyte equals 
1,000 gigabytes which then equ;Us 
1.000,000 megabytes. 

So just what is the site? It Ls a 
series of satellite photos of the 
world, most taken back in the 80s, 

Each click of die mou.se lakes 
you progressively closer lo what 
you are looking for. Its detail is fan- 
tastic. 

I was literally able lo find my 
bousing addition, then find my 
bouse. Hint: select a spot on earth 
from Uie side bar. It saves you from 



ihe trouble of getting lost from all 
the zooming in. 

Also, find a computer that runs 
at least 200 MHz. i had trouble with 
most in the library; only the fast 
ones on the right side worked well 
widi diissite. 

One of die most amusing sites I 
was led lo was http://www.eon- 
linccom/Fun/G antes. 

This web site consisted of sev- 
eral games poking fun at celebrities 
and movies alike. 

Some of die games involved 
were Chasing Leonardo DiCaprio. 
Sink the Titanic, and Boxing Widi 
OJ. Simp.son (don't be fooled - the 
"Juice" can throw some wicked 
punches with those Isotoner 
gloves). 

I also enjoyed die Sink the 
Titanic game, with Steven 
Spielberg on die Amisiad, shooting 
cannonballs at the Titanic charac- 
ters running aaoss the Titanic deck. 

These games run using 
Shockwave, so these programs will 
require the use of that program to 
play Uiem, 

Also, computers with sound 
make the experience even more 
enjoyable. 

I was told about diis next sue. 
and when I surfed diere I was in 
awe. It IS hllp://w&gt;vw.geocities. 



com/Su rwetSlrip/Pal ins/484S/u2p 
age.html. 

I have never seen a site built 
this well for any music group It had 
in-depth stuff about U2. music 
clips, and pictures. 

Prior to entering the site, I had 
thought to myself "I'll bet it does 
have a lot of U2 stuff, but what 
about that "Simpson's" episode?" 

As it turns otJt, there are two 



scenes from the "Simpson's" 

episode in U2's pictures page. 

If you are a U2 fan, you must 
visit this page. 

If you aren't, I still recommend 
visiting diis iniercsiing page when 
you gel the chance.

Child Care Center celebration 



hy Gall Ru hit -Crawford 

Edilor 

The IPFW Child Care Cenier is cele- 
braiing ils rcceni expansion and refurbish- 
ing of iis playground by hosting an open 
house on Monday, Sepl, 28, from noon until 
I p.m. 

The open house will feature tours of the 
facility's expansion. 

According lo Lynda L. Place, director, 
IPFW hai offered childcfue in various loca- 
tions over the years. 

Childcare faciliiies were previously 
o^ered in a consonium with the Stale 
Developmental Center, and for a short lime, 
learned up with Ivy Tech and Parkview lo 
form the Educaie OiildCare Cenier 

The present site, located at 4133 
iiobson Rd., opened in 1995. 

"The current Center allows IPFW lo 
tailor Ihe schedule and fees to better meet 
the child care needs of the siudcnis here," 



said Place. 

There are currently a total of 20 staff 
members employed in the Center. 

Two of the positions, director and assis- 
tant dircaor, arc full-time. 

The other positions arc part-time, and 
many are IPFW students. 

There arc two full-time lead teachers 
who design and implement the Center's 
curriculum. 

The Cenier has approximately 135 stu- 
dents, wiih a capacity of 55 at any one lime. 

Each child enrolled in the Cenier is eli- 
gible for 20 hours of care per week, and all 
care is part-time. 

Most of the families enrolled are those 
of students, but there are also faculty and 
staff families enrolled pan-time. 

Each family re-enrolls each semester. 
Families of two- and three-year-olds arc 
encouraged to register early, as that age 
group fills up quickly, according to Place 

lliis semester Place said that children 
had to be lumed away for ihc morning 
classes because all of the available slots 



were rilled. 

"1 believe thai we provide an important 
service for student-parents. The Cenier has 
been designed so thai schedules are flexible 
to meet the needs of class limes, study 
times, and related activities, and fees arc 
k-'pt as low as possible," Place said. 

The new expansion was the result of a 
proposal submitted by Place lo Frank 
Borelli, vice chancellor of Siudent Affairs, 
and Chancellor Michael Wanell. 

The new expansion broke down the age 
grouping of four- lo 12-year olds, who had 
been previously placed in one group, 

liie result were two classes, ages four 
losix and seven lo 12. 

Place added that this allows activities 
more fining for each age group to be 
planned 

The new extension allows older chil- 
dren the chance to take pan in programs 
more appropriate to 
iheir ages, rather than 
being cared for in a 
preschool setting. 




according to 
Place, 

" We ■ v e 
had a lol of 
positive feed- 
back from 
parents, and 
they're grate- 
ful that we 
accept and 
work with the 
local agencies 
10 provide 
child care 
assistance," 
said Evonnc 
Ed monds , 
assisiani director "-'^^ -luppiinivt of our riml.'. ,md requesLs, 

"Child care is a pressing need for par- J^'.'j.'^'Jl-J," J^^^^^}'' ",V"h'"''-K'; tT^'^ '^''

HOME RUN STRETCH 

You [hought you had heard ihe 
end of [he home run race. 
You hoped you had, righi? 
In perhaps ihe mosi aniiclimae- 
tic momeni in sporu history, ihc 
Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa hii 
four home runs lasi weekend, 
breaking Maris' record (again) and 
pulling even with McGwire al 62, 

There was no 1962 Corvclte. 
Maris family in aiiendanee. or call 
from die PresidenI (busy reading 
Ihc Starr report). 

There was. however, a capaciiy 
crowd on hand Sunday — Beanie 
Baby Day ai Wriglcy — who 
watched Sosa hit iwo homers in an 
exciting 11-10 extra inning victory 
over die Brewers. 

I had thought diat after eclips- 
ing Maris' mark, McGwire would 
lighten up, widi the pressure off and 
march toward 70 

1 also thought So.sa was press- 
ing too much, trying to hit the ball 
out of the park. 

Instead. Mac has t;one cold, 
and Sammy ha.s thrived under die 
pressure. 

For the next two weeks, watch- 
ing these two battle for the home 
nin title will supercede any wild 
card race. 

Luckily for Sosa, his team still 
leads the race for the final National 
League playoff spot. 

That brings us to the MVP 
debate. 

Many feel that Sosa's presence 
on die contending Cubs makes him 
more valuable than McGwire to the 
sub .500 Cardinals. 

This is a legitimate point, but 
the MVP award is an individual 
award and should not reilect a 
team's success or failures. 

Based strictly on numbers, die 
award Ls a toss up. 



McGwire leads die league in 
wa]k.s, slugging pet., on base pet., 
and is tied home runs with Sosa. 
who also leads die league in RBl's 
and total ba.ses. 

Many sporLswriters. who vole 
for the award, penciled in McGwire 
Sept, 8 when be hit #62. 

Widi so many watching and 
feeling dial diey were witnessing 
history, they don't want that 
achievement to go unrcwiu^ded. 

I think diat Sammy deserves it, 
but unless he finishes with more 
home runs. Mac will gel it by beat- 
ing Maris' record first, 

NCAA FOOTBALL 
SHOCK 

Going into last weekend's 
matchup between NoWe Dame and 
Michigan State, die question facing 
bodi squads was, "Are the Irish this 
good?" and "Are the Spartans this 
bad?" 

The answer to both questions 
was an overwhelming "NO." 

After the Sparians blocked a 
punt and returned it for a touch- 
down on ND's first possession, 
diey never looked back enrouie to a 
42-3 halflime lead. 

The final score, 45-23 is an 
indication of how many Spartan 
reserves saw second half action, 

Aldiough they were out-played 
in every aspect of die game, it was 
the option and coaching thai did the 
Irish in. 

With Notre Dame's option 
offense, they need to establish the 
run early in Ihc game, and the pass- 
ing game is only effective as a com- 
plement to the running game. 

The option was neutralized and 
this type of offense is not con- 
ducive to quick scoring or coming 
from behind. 

It is ideal for wearing die oppo- 
sition down, catching ihcm off 
guard with a play action pas.s. and 
dominating time of possession, i,e. 
keeping ihe other team off the field. 



Emotion is an integral pan of 
the college game. 

After an emotional victory 
against an over-rated Michigan 
team, it appears that the Irish read 
too many of their own press 
clippings. 

That is head coach Bob Davie's 
job to keep die team on an even- 
keel, and prepared for all 
opponents. 

After die blocked punt/TD, die 
Irish fell apan and never regained 
dieir composure. 

The Spartans next face an 
angry Michigan team, in what is 
always an exciting intrastate 
rivalry. 

The Irish have a week off 
before ho.sting fhirdue on Sept. 26, 

I never diought the Irish would 
need an extra week to prepare for 
Purdue, but trust me diey do. 

The Indiana Hoosicrs opened 
victorious over Western Michigan 
45-30 in what may be one of their 
only victories all season. 

Red-shin freshman QB 
Antwaan Randle El accounted for 
five touchdowns and over 450 total 
yards for the Hoosiere, who face 
Heisman Trophy candidate Tim 
Couch and die Kentucky Wildcats. 
Saturday. 

AROUND THE NFL 

Widi the most important regu- 
lar season in ad major sports, get- 
ting off to an early Stan in die NFL 
is crucial. 

A slow start can and often does 
cost head coaches their jobs. 

The NFL season is also a 
marathon, not a sprint, and it is dif- 
ficult to accurately gauge any team 
diis early in the season. 

The parity diis season is as evi- 
dent as any in rcc«ni history. After 
two games, Atlanta. New Orleans, 
San Diego and Seattle arc all widi- 
out a loss. 

Meanwhile Detroit, Tampa 
Day, the New York Jets, and 



Washington are all 
win less. 

The Bears and the 
Colts are not only win- 
less, but hopeless. 

To no one's sur- 
prise, perennial powers 
Green Bay, San 
Francisco, Pittsburgh | 
and Denver are all off 
to fast staru. 

The variable that 
inevitably affects all 
teams is injuries 

Last weekend Troy 
Aikman broke his clav- 
icle (collarbone) and is 
out for four to eight 
weeks. 

Also lost with bro- 
ken leg bones were 
Minnesota QB Brad 
Johnson, and Green 
Bay running back 
Dorsey Lcvcns. 

With die lack of 
quality back-ups. we 
see that many quality 
NFL teams are only a 
play away from medi- 
ocrity.

!PF\V mens soccer was in action against Saginaw 
Valley State this past week. It was one of [he Dons bet- 
ter showings of the season. 

"1 think we played really well, especially in the sec- 
ond half," Braden Butler said. "(Malt) Hein and 
(Danny) Perez played great, and (JefO Richey was a 
con.slant in goal." 

Butler couldn't have been any more precise. Hein 
and Felz each had two goals apiece and Riehey held the 
Cardinals offense to only one goal. 

"The win was one of the best offensive effons by an 
IPFW team in the past few years," IPFW soccer coach 
Terry Sief;mkiewicz said. 

Tbe game was dominated by IPFW since the gel go. 
The Dons put two goals up in the first half both by 
.senior forward Danny Perez.
