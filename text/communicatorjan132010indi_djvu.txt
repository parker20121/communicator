On lanuary 8. 2009. Lupe 
Fiasco. Kenna, Jessica Biel and others 
started their climb of Mi. Kilimanjaro 
in Africa. Commercials of the 3 notable 
entertainers have been around for 
awhile now and they are finally getting 
lo it. The project is meant to bring 
awareness to a global issue. Over I 
billion people do not have access to 



clean, safe, drinking water. "The climb 
is being used as a way lo highlight an 
exlreme problem by doing snmelhing 
just as extreme," artist Kenna says. All of 
the participants have gone under lough 
training in preparalion for the climb. 
Rapper Lupe Fiasco has always had a 
goal of climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro and 
his fellow climbers have been joking 
around saying he has been, 'acting like 
a veteran." MTV will be covering the 
climb and you can also keep up with 
their progress al Summltonlhcsummlt 



Letter to the Editor 



Rally for Rail 



We used to have a very popular 
passenger rail service that traveled 
from Fort Wayne to Chicago and oiher 
major cities. This service left Fort 
Wayne almost 20 years ago when freight 
companies decided thai passenger rail 
service was not economically feasible 
anymore.' Well, times have changed. 
Combined with rising energy prices, 
the Obama Administration has opened 
up billions of dollars in federal stimulus 
money for expanded rail service all 
across the country. This puts the 
possibility of getting train service back 
in Fort Wayne a reality. 

However, this won't happen 
automatically. The community has 
to voice its opinion and show strong 
support for passenger rail It can be 
done by writing &gt; our state and federal 
officials, and writing letters to the 



editors of local newspapers This is 
truly a community effort. So, if you 
want fast reliable train service in Fort 
Wayne, you need 10 gel involved! 

A good place to start would be al a 
Rally for Bail held in the Baker Street 
Tram Station on Saturday, (anurary 
16 at 2pm. Indiana Department of 
Transportation officials will be there 
to talk about the progress Indiana has 
made in securing federal stimulus 
funds for a Chicago to Fori Wayne 
route. 

Sincerely. 
Justin Stalter

Coffee Break 



by Kim Coffey 




Turning the 14th Century into the 21st Century 

English and Linguistics Professor has his students perform a medieval play with a modern twist 



ify Peter Schnellenberger 



Damian Fleming is an DSStstunl professor of 
English and Linguistics at IPFW. During the fall 
lOmaatQI of 2009, ho tailghl English IJ06, a survey 
t iiiitM- mi Middle English I IteraHire. The purpose of 
this course was to get students to comprehend the 
language used and allegorical messages of the texts 
thai were written between the years 1200 and 1500 
AD. This can he a lofty goal given that, according 
to Fleming, the texts are "really dense, they are like 
500 years old. and they arc hard to get a handle on. 
But what I noticed is if you take time and read them 
carefully, 1 find them fascinating and really quite 
funny.'' 

In on attempt to get his students to appreciate 
tile humor of the dramatic literature he employed 
an experimental form of leaching that combined 
linguistic translation with theatrical flair. Instead of 
just having his students complete a textual analysis, 
listen to a lecture and write an essay or take a test. 



Fleming divided his class into four groups. Each 

group was assigned a medieval play and asked to 

adapt that play from 

Middle English into 

Modern English and 

then perform them in 

from of the class. 

Students In 

literature classes arc 
not normally asked 
to perform the works 
that they are studying, 
but Fleming felt that 
if his students knew 
they were going to 
have to perform their 
translation in front 
of class then they 
would take the project 
seriously. 

Fleming was extremely pleased by the results of 
his experiment, almost all of his students received As

Hi

Fleming said 

that he does not 
know of any other 
teachers who use this 
approach to teaching 
medieval literature. 
This experiment was 
so successful that he 
is considering doing 
further research with 

this teaching technique presenting bis Findings at a 

conference. 



Student Government Pays to Travel 

Two IPFW students travel to Athens, Greece to learn new things 



Dear Editor-in-Chief, 

I believe very few students are 
aware of the opportunity available 
to them to go to educational 
conferences and trips through our 
Student government's travel fund. 
I recent]) went on a trip to Athens. 
Greece with fellow student. 
Amanda McCann. because of 
this opportunity. We were able 
to explore the ancient ruins of 
Athens, such as the Acropolis, 
the Roman Agora, the temple of 
'ens ami Hadrian's Vrch. While 
WO were in Athens we also learned 
quite a bit about the culture. 
We attended a Modem Greek 
play, saw musicians performing 
traditional Greek music, and 
tasted Greek cuisine. My favorite 
pan of the trip was our visit to the 
fiaka district of \ihens. This was a 



place overflowing with life. There 
were open air markets, people 
bartering, and hide cafe's. People 
were very friendly our entire stay 
in Athens. On the way to a Museum 
we got lost, so we went into a 
bakery and tried to get dircctions. 
The young man working there 
didn't speak English, but he did 
give us each a free pastry. We 
enjoyed quite a few museums such 
as the Archeo logical Museum. The 
National Gallery, and so many 
others. We saw and did so much 
while we were in Athens, got to 
know some lovely people, and 
experience things, that we would 
not have been able to. had it not 
been for this opportunity given to 
us by our Student Government-

For the Love of Traveling 



By H ana Al H awash 

No matter which one I am in, 
airports are like a second home to 
me: 1 feel comfortable and excited. 
Having been there a minimum 
of six times, ihe Schipol Airport, 
Amsterdam, is my favorite of all. 
It is a small lown In Itself and yet I 
could lell you where to go for any 
need Itnni a qulei prayer lo buying 
a cheap bottle otlaekllamels. Mere. 
people null up inr a drink before 
QlghtSb] one ol the numerous bars 
or visit the Mi Donalds to net some 
I rciuh tins, which yon have to 
buy ketchup for at about 70 cents 
a packet. 

i inr thing I love about airports 
and airplanes is meeting new 
people You can leam so much 
from the person silting next to 
you, and become so close to 
someone in an airport or on a 
long Might. You feel a connection 
with the person you are sharing so 
much time arm-lo-ann with and 
they become your support. For 
example, on one of my many eight 
to ten hour [lights coming home 
from Palestine. I met a young 
American man, not too much 
older than myself. He had been 
helping out in the Palestinian 
refugee camp and got deponed by 
Israel. He was helping my people; 
there was an automatic feeling of 
contfon between us. We ended up 
sharing food and even using each 
other as pillows. 

Airports are full of people 
from even- walk of life and from 
all around the world. Of course 
sou should be on your guard: 
do not trust just anyone, but 
do not hesitate to share general

New Year's: Wacky new year's resolutions that IPFW students said they would do.

small amounts of money begin (o ac-

This is the start of a brand new year, 
when people accidentally scribble the 
wrong numbers onto the corners of let- 



ters, checks and |ob applications. 

Sometime between the last holiday 
get-togethers and watching Dick Clark 
announce the ball dropping in New 
York, something clicks. People start to 
ask themselves what they did wrong In 
the previous year. With a list of prob- 
lems floating in their head, of course, 
solutions arc sure to follow. Resolu- 
tions, to be exact - they begin to write 
out a fresh list of resolutions. 

Among many of these lists are 
promises to diet, save money, be belter 
p eople. do better at their workplace, 



find time Foi the gym and spend more

Health Advantage 101: 

Stress Management 



By Ana Aguirre 

*guu*OI*iludnraipt*r*i 

Most stress derives from the typical 
troubles thBl lend to disrupt an Indi- 
viduals locus mi the essential aspects 
of life. As the New Year sets in students 
and faculty across the campus prepare 
themselves (or the challenges they are 
about to face whether it is of educa- 
tional or social background 

The various tasks that seem to be 
the main stressors for college students 
are the constant rescheduling of class- 
es, minimal parking spaces and the 
amount of homework to be balanced 
throughout the semester. 

Elizabeth Scott. M.S.. writer of an 
article called, "tlow to Reduce Student 
Stress and Excel in School*, gives ex- 
amples on how to counter act the dis- 
ease and focus on the most important 
points of a day-day student schedule. 

In her review she states that time 
management, organization, study 
emimmneiii. sleeping schedule and 
study habits could all be results of ma- 
tor stress. Scoit also informs the stu- 
dent readers of the steps in which to 



take to reduce the amounl of stress an 

individual may have. 

When talking to IPFW students, 
most agreed that time management 
was an overall issue, till Edmonds, a 
former athlete for the women's Cross- 
country team replied. "It's a hard thing 
to do when you're an athlete since 
there are so many things to do outside 
the classroom. I would definitely say a 
daily planner is useful." 

Common symptoms of stress ac- 
conllng to www.webmd.com are gen- 
erally associated with a "fight or flight' 
feeling, giving the body bursts of ener- 
gy* unable to handle Other symptoms 
include headaches, back pain, weak- 
ened immune system and prolonged 
mood swings. Of course checking with 
your doctor is recommended for a cor- 
rect diagnosis. 

Becoming aware of your weakness- 
es is a posiih-e first step in starring the 
reduction process. Try talking to friends 
or even an IPFW campus counselor lo- 
cated in Walb Student Union room 210. 
The first six sessions are included in die 
tuition and there is always someone 
available to help in a time of crisis.
