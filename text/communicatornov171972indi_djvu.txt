Service to look for potential 
minority graduate students 



A new program designed 
to help the nation's grad- 
uate schools seek out po- 
tential students from mi- 
nority groups la underway 
this fall. 

Called the Minority Grad- 
uate Student Locater Ser- 
vice, the program Is of- 
fered by Educational Test- 
ing Service. ETS esti- 
mates that about 10.000 to 
15,000 students could ini- 
tially use the new service 
which la offered free to 
both ^udents and Institu- 
tions this year. 

According to J. Bradley 
Williams, ETS director of 
the project, "One of the 
problems facing graduate 
schools seeking to Increase 
enrollment of students 
from racial and ethnic ml- 
.norltles la that of Identl- 
fylng potential students." 
Now, students will have 
a chance to voluntarily 
complete a special 17-ltem 
questionnaire as one step 
towards entering graduate 
school. 

Information about the aca- 
demic interests and goals 
of Black, American-Indian, 
Asian - American, and 
Spanish or Mexican - A- 
merican students who wish 
to pursue graduate level 
education, will be available 
to those institutions seek- 
ing to bolster minority en- 
rollment. 

Admissions officers may 
then contact students di- 
rectly and Invite the ap- 
plications of those whose 
parUcular Interests could 
be served by their schools' 
graduate offerings. 

The locater service will 
be used first by graduate 
schools In December, Ac- 
cording to Williams, some 
300 schools are expected 
to join this year with more 
offering the program later. 
The. locater service Is 
open to second-term col- 
lege juniors, seniors, and 
;coUege graduates. 



Nearly 2,200 counselors 
at undergraduate schools 
across the country have re- 
ceived Information about 
the program and can sup- 
ply questionnaires tc in- 
terested students, what- 
ever their racial back- 
ground. 

The student response form 
Is also available with in- 
formation bulletins de- 
scribing the Graduate Re- 
cord Examinations (GRE). 
But ETS said GRE scores 
are not Included in the lo- 
cater service and that a 
student need not take the 
exama In order to parti- 
cipate In the locater ser- 
vice.

Donahue memorial fund 
to be established 



I-PU Chapter of the Amer- 
ican Association of Univer- 
sity Professors has an- 
nounced formation of a 
memorial fund In the name 
of the late Dr, William E, 
Donahue who was a mem- 
ber of the I-PU faculty here 
since 1963. 

Donahue died suddenly 
overseas, at Coblenz, Ger- 
many, where he was va- 
cationing after doing a year 
of postdoctoral work at the 
University of Marseilles. 

Dr. David McCants, who 
announced the development 
of the Donahue Memorial 
Fund, noted that not only 
was the late professor af- 
flUated with I-PU, but he 
lad also been head of the 
chemistry program at Ind- 
iana Institute of Technology 
from 1955 to 1959. 

An outstanding chemist, 
Donahue had been named 
C h e m i 6 t-of-t h e- Year In 
1968. In addition to teaching 
chemistry at Indiana Tech. 
he served as chairman of 
the chemistry department; 



was the first Dean for Aca- 
demic Affairs for Purdue, 
and was one of the founders 
and first president of the 
AAUP Chapter. 

Dr. McCants pointed out 
that since no memorial 
services w e r e h e 1 d here 
following Donahue's death, 
there might be persons In 
the community who would 
want to contribute to this 
memorial fund which will 
be used for any one of three 
possible projectsi To per- 
petuate the National AAUP 
Academic Foundation Fund; 
for scholarship assistance 
ofdeaerving chemistry stu- 
dents; or for the acquisi- 
tion of books to be placed 
In the new Indiana-Purdue

Opportunity to study in Spain 
is present for students 



I-PU COMMUNICATOR 



Page 3 



Each year, for six weeks 
of the summer, Augustana 
College in Rock Island, Il- 
linois, offers to studentsin 
the United States and Can- 
ada an opportunity to study 
in Spain. 

Plans are already In 
progress for the Ninth 
Summer School in Spain, 
1973. All persons inter- 
ested should contact Dr. 
A. Doreste, Augustana Col- 
lege, Rock Island, Illinois, 
61201, for complete infor- 
mation. 

Last summer the pro- 
gram hegan on June 30. 
The 103 students from 25 
states, Cuba, Canada, Hai- 
ti, Mexico, the Virgin Is- 
lands and Puerto Rico, rep- 
resenting 49 colleges and 
universities flew to Ma- 
drid where the director of 
the program. Dr. Doreste, 
met them. 

The students lived and 
attended class at the U- 
nlverslty of Madrid, The 
living quarters consisted 
of one room per student. 
The dormitory had its own 
private swimming pool and 
tennis . and .basketball 
courts. The academic 
program was conducted by 
natvle Spanish professors 
from the University of Ma- 
drid and American Institu- 
tions. 

unce or twice a week 
a group trip was sched- 
uled to visit such histori- 
cal places as Valle de los 

;:; caydge:^-'-segov}a„ , ei.Es- 

corlal, Avila, Toledo, Mu- 
seo del Prado, Palacio 
Real, etc. Students found 
however, that they had 
more than enough time to 
do, see, ana learn what- 
ever they chose. 

As a part of the pro- 
gram, a trip was taken to 
southern Spain. As a group 
they attended a flamenco 
dance, Moroccan night 
clubs, and visited famous 
cities like Cordoba. Gran- 



ada, Malaga and SevUla. 
They also spent two full 
days at the famous Tor- 
remollnos Beach. In each 
city the group was accom- 
odated In deluxe hotels with 
excellent food. At night, 
students often went to the 
old parts of the cities In 
horaedrawn carriages. To 
complete the excitement of 
this tour, some students 
crossed the straight of Gi- 
braltar and spent one day 
In Tangier, Africa, (To ac- 
company the entire tour, 
lectures were given In each 
place of historical Inter- 
est.) When the tour was 
over in the South, the group 
returned to Madrid for two 
days where partlesof fare- 
well were given.

Dual Universitv 

Plan ignoresjinification 

Unfortunately for I-PU, the Corrmiaslon for Higher Ed- 
ucation all but ignored the most pressing problem we have. 
This, of course, is unification. 

The CommiBslor. recommended that the two institutions 
study the possibility of unification. But both Institutions 
have shown that they do not want to unify administrations. 
If they did care about our problems, the study would have 
happened long ago. 

It is unfortunate that the only way the problems of the Dual 
University can be studied is by direct order of a super- 
board of trustees. 

And now that the order has been given. It Is more than 
likely thai both lUand PU will drag their feet in effort to 
maintain the status quo, at whatever cost. 

This leaves the responsibility for the needed change with 
the students ^nd faculty. It is up to these two constituencies 
to act if anything Is to be done. 

To further stimulate Immediate action, we wish to put for- 
ward our plan for the method of study. 

First of all, we urge the two presidents to commission a 
blue-ribbon comnilttee to propose a unification procedure 
and structure. Because of the work load Involved, the 
committee will have to be large. 

Membership of the committee should consist of one Indiana 
and one Purdue administrator, one Indiana-Purdue admin- 
istrator, three Indiana and three Purdue faculty, five Ind- 
iana-Purdue students, and the respective trustees of this 
area. 

This is our proposal; can we expect any action on it? 

Penny Carnival needs 
better SUB planning 

The campus service project with perhaps the great- 
est potential for good community public relations Is the 
Penny Carnival. Sponsered each year by the Student 
Union Board of the Students' Government, Penny Carnival 
requires the participation of everyone at I-PU to be 
successful. This year something was missing. 

The usual activists again showed their enthusiasm. 
Circle K had a fantastic booth that was quite popular with 
the kids. Delta Gamma and Kappa Delta Theta sororities 
produces well constructed and planned displays. The 
Dental Hyglensts were judged to have the best over-all- 
booth. And Geology Club, APO, and other student organi- 
zations gave their time for the project. 
. What was missing was Involvement by the student body. 
Only about 50 volunteered to "adopt" one of the kids from 
the local orphanages and hospitals. Other than hard-core 
of socially-conscious organizations, very few others re- 
sponded to the call for time and energy. 

All this can be passed off as "apathy". But that" apathetic 

campus" routine Is getting old. The same campus produced 

a tremendously successful Penny Carnival last year. 

We think that the responsibility for this year's failure 

rests with the Student Union Board. Their planning was 

poor, and the enthusiasm for the project was reflected by 

the over-all student body enthusiasm. 
It was obvious the Penny Carnival was not high on the 

SUB list prlortles. Hopeful ly, next year It will be. 




One of the most ridiculous 
examples of wasted money 
through petty bureaucracy 
can be found by stepping 
Into the new library arid 
accepting their invitation to 
go down and play a record. 
The first problem Is that 
once you get off the elevator 
you are on your own un- 
less you find a person will- 
ing to direct you. Finding 
the record players Is easy, 
however, compared to the 
ordeal which follows. 

ft seems simple enough to 
find a nice record to listen 
to doesn't it? Except that 
their file catalogue Is 
somewhere being over- 
hauled and so you can't 
browse through and select, 
and If you could the guy 
couldn't find it without a 
number anyway. There lea 
minor semi-solution If you 
don't object to Dr. On- 
wood's choice in music. He 
has 22 records on reserve. 
Or, you can listen to the one 
personal record brought In 
by Mr. Flick. 

Having made your selec- 
tion from their half-vast 
collection, you are ready to 
listen — or are you? Now, 
you must go get the dust 
cover from the turntable 
you Intend to use, and turn 
It in. It seems ludicrous 
since the two main pur- 
poses of a dust cover are 
to cut down on the mechani- 
cal noise of needle on re- 
cord, and to keep the dust 
from accumulating on the 
record. The hint of tech- 
nical Ignorance begins to 
grow Into a conviction with 
what followed my attempt 
to explain this seemingly 
obvious point, however, as 
the attendant handed me the 
cartridge to Install on the 
arm by myself. 

I am not the most pro- 
ficient guy when It comes 
to mechanical operations: 
In fact, I carry a scar from 
trying to open a can of 
Pork and Beans, But, I do 
have a background' in 
electronics, and I am well 
aware that the biggest 
cause of equipment mal- 
function is unqualified 
operators. Now, they make 
you turn in the dustcover 
to maximize the dust get- 
ting onto the record and 
Into the gears, then they 
tell you to put the cart- 
ridge on by yourself. You 
cannot help but laugh when 
the attendant very serious- 
ly tells you not to get finger- 
prints on the record. 

Finally, as you put your 
record on a very nice turn- 
table, you notice that you 
are plugging your medium 
price headset Into a cheap, 
cheap amplifier. It hardly 
comes as a surprise when 
you hear the Schockley ef- 
fect (transltor noise) 
coming In louder than the 
Bartok Concerto. As you 
fiddle with the gain and 
balance controls ( both 
channels on one shaft) you 
realize that you have two 
choices: turn the volume 
down so low that you can't 
hear the music, or turn the 
noise up so loud that you 



can't hear the music. And 
by the way, you only turn 
the noise up, the music 
level hardly Increases at 
alU 

All In all, the only thing 
that frustrated me more 
than seeing petty pro- 
cedure being valuated more 
hl^y than the equipment.

Contrary to common 

opinion, we In Student's 
Government have been 
working for you to the best 
of our abilities. We have 
suffered a setback in a 
number of areas, however, 
due to the time and effort 
set forth by this office in 
studying the Indiana Com- 
mission's Report on Post- 
Secondary Education. We 
have also spent time in 
making Information on the 
Report available to the stu- 
dent body and In gathering 
support for Indiana-Purdue 
University efforts. In our 
estimation, this report has 
priority due to the fact 
that when presented to the 
State Legislators it must 
contain proposals that are 
pertinent to the develop- 
ment of- I-PU at Fort- 
Wayne. 

Those of you who have 
read the synopsis of the 
Commission's Report may 
have noticed that there are 
certain proposals that 
refer to this campus but 
which do not seem to be the 
most advantageous recom- 
mendations available. 

Petitions attempting to 
gain student and public 
opinion on the Report have 
been made available. The 
petitions and such mes- 
sages as this column are 
the only means we have to 
communication with you on 
this issue. These petitions 
will be utilized In our stand 
on the Report, The more 
signatures we have, the 
easier It will be for us to 
help 'you. Additional 



petitions are available in 
the Students' Government 
office. Room 109 of the Edu- 
cation Building. 

With more students desir- 
ing additional sports on 
campus, we in Students' 
Government are offering 
table tennis and chess 
tournaments in the near 
future. To determine the 
types of sports desired by 
students on campus. 
Students' Government is 
also putting out a question- 
naire. We can't promise 
that we will be able to pro- 
vide all desired sports on 
campus, but we will try; and 
the petitions will be dis- 
tributed soon. 

Students* Government also 
is completing work on the 
Student Tutoring Cprpg, . 
The names of scudents'whtf-' 
will be available to help 
other students with their 
coursework are now being 
compiled and printed. 
These'lists should be ready 
for distribution by Wed- 
nesday, November 22. 

Any students Interested In 
working on any of the 
scheduled projects are en- 
couraged to comtact the 
Students* Government of- 
fice. If there Is anything 
you would like to do, there 
Is a place for you In The 
Students' Government. 

There are student direc- 
tories still available In the

Freedom in society - 
a reply 



In the September 29 Issue 
of the Communicator, Mike 
EUlB (In his article "Sex 
and the Morality Myth") 
made some statements 
upon which I would like to 
briefly comment. My com- 
ments win be generally 
supportive of Mr. ElUs's 
position. Atthe sametlme, 
even though I agree with 
the main points of "Sex 
and the Morality Myth," 
my reasons for doing so, 
that Is, my approach to 
the problem Is different 
from Mike's and this will 
become apparent as this 
article proceeds. 

Mr. Ellis directs his 
article to a discussion of 
sexuality and the affect 
society has on $n Ip- 
dlvidual's competency to 
choose his own sexual val- 
ues. The ability of society 
to Influence and even de- 
termine our values and de- 
cisions In our life in society 
la the subject of this ar- 
ticle and others to follow. 
My aim Is to deal with the 
broader question of human 
fre^fll^iji-g^nerai;. _.,-;;„ ^.V 

One of the more perti- 
nent questions posed by 
Mr. Ellis focuses around 
whether or not "social val- 
ues and dictates actually 
exist over and above (my 
emphasis) the individual's 
own world." This Is to 
ask the question of the 
existence of "some tran- 
scendant, all-affecting so- 
cial codebook of morality." 
The real question here Is 
whether or not societal 
norms are in some sense 
objectively "true," eter- 
nal, and hence, morally 
binding for all peoples of 
all societies on this eanh. 
Mr. Ellis responds with a 
resounding "no." His 
reason Is that by "allowing 
ourselves to be dominated 
by social values Is a lack 
of integrityl" Indeed it Is 
this but it is far more. 
By permitting ourselves to 
be completely (or even par- 
tially) subservient to social 
norms we negate the very 
fact of our personal free- 
dom. 

However, It Is Irrele- 
vant for us to be overly 
concerned with the degree 
to which society Influences* 
or affects our personal 
value system. What we as 
Individuals must do Is to 
give to society a measure 
of power over us which 
win not restrict serious- 
ly our freedom over the 
more important matters 
of our lives. For example, 
as a student I am told to 
take certain courses which 
the university deems es- 
sential to a modicum of 
cotnpetency in the field or 



discipline which claims my 
Interest. As long as this 
does not interfere with my 
personal quest for know- 
ledge and understanding, 
I am perfectly willing to 
submit to the ridiculous 
tests, required papers, and 
other university parapha- 
nella connected with course 
work. All of this, to me. 
Is simply peripheral to my 
basic concern and reason 
for being In college which 
is, quite basically, to un- 
derstand. However, when 
university requirements 
and the petty whims and 
compulsions of professors 
Interfere with my basic 
need to understand, that 
university and those pro- 
fessors are (consciously 
or unconsciously) defining 
me as being unable to gov- 
ern my life and cultivate 
my talents and tastes. Ul- 
timately, the university Is 
telling me that I am un- 
free. 

As we shall see, the 
question of personal free- 
dom Is npf a small one. 
Neither Is it a simple one. 
One of the reasons for the 
complexity of the problem 
Is the simple fact that there 
are millions of individuals 
in this world; each one with 
varying degrees of aware- 
ness of the meaning of his 
life and the nature of his 
freedom. Such meanings 
can only come from each 
one of us. Nobody else 
(such as a university) can 
force us to attribute a spe- 
cific meaning to our ac- 
tivities. Such meaning must 
be intrinsic if we are to be 
free. 

In the next few weeks, 
the Communicator will 
publish a series of articles 
written by me with the in- 
tention of shedding some 
light on the question of 
determinism versus free- 
dom. I shall explore the 
nature of freedom and Its 
meaning for us as indi- 
viduals. As I have Implied 
above, the conclusions to 
which Mr. Ellis and I have 
arrived are almost Iden- 
tical. Our only differences 
have been the way In which 
we have arrived at these 
conclusions.

Does anyone suppose It 
lucky to be born? I hasten 
to tell him or her it is 
just as lucky to die, and 
I know It. —Walt Whitman 



Rise up, oh ye children 
of the Obscure, but die; 
rise up, but die. My words 
are empty. They ring hol- 
low. But if you can ever 
discover them, you shall 
rejoice with me in death. 
I n many ways, we are 
dying everyday. Our souls, 
our visions, our histories, 
our passions - all continu- 
ally rot away under the 
guise of progress and pro- 
priety. The Issue is not 
dying, but rather under- 
standing our dying. By 
our ignorance of death, we 
die unceasingly. By our 
cowardice before death, we 
never live. By our denial 
of death, we are enslaved 
to it. By our Justifica- 
tions of our In-anltles, we 
teach our children war and 
indifference. Forgive us. 
Lord, for we know not what 
we do. 

These words, ineffective 
and hollow, resound within 
my soul, sending tremors 
of solemnity throughout my 
existence. Even so, I die 
with my language. And, 
lo, see how you persecute 
me now with my language. 
If these hollow words are 
to be filled, they must be 
filled with your lives. We 
can make public agree- 
ments about how and In 
what contexts our words 
will have meaning, but 
rules and contexts are not 
Impervious, As easily as 
we renounce our destiny, 
we can remove contexts. 
The problem, and perhaps 
our salvation. Is that when 
we remove contexts, weal- 
low pans of our lives to 
whither and die. Imagine 
the one who removes one 
context, only to substitute 
another in its place; hasn't 
she/he denied Ufe already? 
Live in spite of contexts, 
not for them! Live in spite 
of rules, not because of 
them I 

Men and women seem to 
fear death. A perversity. 
Death is the gentlest Of 
gifts the universe has pro- 
vided for us. How many 
times have we scoffed at 
death and the universe, 
building up ourselves? How 



large we are, compared to 
the unlversel We are the 
inhabitants of a grain of 
sand, with miles of empti- 
ness between thlsgralnand 
the next. How significant 
we are as we pop into and 
out of existence within a 
-thousandth of a second, 
while trees and flowers live 
for years. How we have 
played games with words 
and life itself, while vi- 
sions and hopes remain 
etemaL You ask me why 
we should learn to die. 
But even within the tone 
of your questioning , you 
yearn for one more game 
to play. 

Experiences we call our 
own. We personalize and 
temporalize the chaotic, 
disorganized events that 
happen to us from now- 
here and die into the no- 
thingness from which they 
came. Owning events Is 
a constant task of mean- 
ing giving. How does own- 
ing events create mean- 
ings? According to what 
do "meanings" become 
meaningful? By our fu- 
ture-orientation. Only by 
our dreams and visions do 
we find meaning for our 
lives. But what Is It that 
grounds the very possibil- 
ity of our ability to dream? 
What is it that remains to- 
tally future? What Is It 
that Is the purest of pure, 
the totally -potential of all 
our potentialities? Only 
our deaths. Death Is our 
only possibility that re- 
mains pure. 

We say we "have ex- 
periences" but wecan nev- 
er "have" our own death. 
We can never experience 
our deaths, for as soon as 
death is, we are not. Does 
this not suggest that our 
lives are simply EVENTS 
within the chaotic flow of 
events? If this Is so. If 
life cannot have meaning, 
why live at all? If life 
can have meaning, from 
where does It come? Death, 
If death cannot be experi- 
enced, how can we project 
In, through, and from It so 
as to let It serve as the 

ground of meaningful 
meaning-giving life? 

Only If we live the purest 
of possibilities can our 
lives be pure. Only if we 
exist from the ground of ' 
meaning can our lives he

meaningful. Only if we 
live our deaths dally can 
we live at all. We should 
not fear death, but antici- 
pate Its arrival. Our lives 
should be a celebration of 
death; our deaths should be 
a celebration of life. Only 
be living as closely as pos- 
sible to non-being can our 
being now see itself. 

We attempt to love un- 
conditionally, but flee from 
ultimate loving In the face 
of death. How, I ask you, 
can we seek love when our 
constant reservation is the 
preservation of our lives? 
You flee death. I say, 
live unto deathl LivedeathI 
Love through deathl Only 
those who know how to die 
can understand why war 
and hatred are the most 
repulsive of blasphemes a- 
gainst the purity and 
gentleness of Death. Only 
those who live unto death 
can understand the sim- 
plicity of love. 

At the beginning of this 
article, a condemnation 
was raised against our al- 
lowing our dreams and vi- 
sions to die. But now I 
say that we must constant- 
ly live death. How Is such 
a condemnation possible? 
By our fleeing from death, 
those things to which we de- 
sire to give life (dreams, 
love, creativity, peace), we 
let wither unto fruitless- 
ness. If, however, we live 
in anticipation of death, 
those dreams and passions 
are living already, Jesus 
of Nazareth once said the 
person who attempts to 
save his/her life shall 
surely lose it, but she/he 
who is willing to lose It, 
shall find It. This, I say, 
is true. 

Anticipating death de- 
mands an entirely new life 
style. It demands an ulti- 
mate resolution of me to 
be myself. It demands that 
1 do not destroy myself by 
attempting to destroy o- 
thers. It demands that I 
do not enslave myself by 
trying to robothersofthelr 
freedom. I ask you, what 
does your death mean to 
you? What does It mean?

Committee releases study off I-PU commuter students 



Editor's Note: 

The following text is the 
report of the Commuter 
Study Committee. More 
information on the study 
may be obtained by con- 
tacting any of ttie comm- 
ittee members through the 
Office of Student Services.

introduction 

At the suggestion of 
Reverend Dan Motto, an ad 
hoc Campus Ministry Com- 
mittee was formed early In 
the Summer of 1971 for the 
purpose of discussing a 
method whereby students 
could evaluate and assess 
those university policies, 
services, and educational 
climates which affect their 
campus life. 
Given evaluative data, the 
Campus Ministry Com- 
mittee could then assume a 
facilitating role in focus- 
ing attention on those areas 
of student concern where 
changes in present policy 
and/or services were 
needed. 
Consideration was given 
by the committee to seek 
"outside" grant money for 
the underwriting of a com- 
muter campus study. Pre- 
liminary Investigation of 
this idea, however, was 
tabled in favor of moving 
ahead immediately with the 
project using local ex&gt; 
pertlse on a voluntary 
basis. 
David Smith of the Uni- 
versity Division conducted 
a cursory review of re- 
search literature relating 
to commuter student 
studies. In summary, these 
and other related com- 
muter campus studies sug- 
gest that: 

Commuter campuses are 
an increasing phenomenon 
In higher education. Once" 
considered to be a service 
to working adults or part- 
time students, commuter 
campuses are now serving 
-^a student body the major- 
&lt;-.lty of which Is full-time. 
Commuter campuses also 
offer an Increaslngnumber 
of complete degree pro- 
grams so that students once 
channeled to residential 
campuses do all their work 
on the commuter campus. 
As a result, a number of 
values in the process of a 
college education are lost. 
Most serious of the losses 
to the student is a cohesive 
environment. The com- 
muter student Is a student 
who lives in a highly frag- 
m e n E e d environment. 
Whereas the residential 
' campus student is Inan en- 
vironment in which his 
fesldentce, his church, his 
peers, _ local_ merchants^ 



often his employer, ecc. 
are supportive of his ex- 
perience as a student, 
a commuter student often 
times finds the opposite Is 
true. A commuter student 
is often forced to Isolate 
his campus experience. He 
must relate to parents, to 
friends, to clergymen, etc., 
who can deal with his ex- 
perience as a student only 
superficially and who. In 
different. If not an- 
tithical, demand on his 
time and thoughts 

The commuter student 
must always deal with 
special problems of geo- 
graphy and time. His ability 
to be involved In academic 
and campus life Is limited 
by the time and distance he 
must give to getting to and 
from campus. Consequent- 
ly, his studying time In the 
university, the time he can 
spend in conversation out- 
side, of class with pro- 
fessors or counselors, the 
time he can give to making 
friends, the time he can 
give to extra-curricular 
programs, the time he can 
give In informal discussion 
of what he has heard in 
class are all severely 
limited. 

The result is a significant 
change In attitude toward 
education by the commuter 
student and hence a change 
In the nature of the edu- 
cational experience. The 
commuter student often 
treats the university like 
a filling station - showing 
up only for class. The ed- 
ucation received Is less 
digested for lack of In- 
formal discussion of the 
ideas and problems, there- 
fore, less Involving, there- 
fore, less meaningful Inlts 
total overall Impact upon 
the student. The education 
received is less Integrated 
into the whole of the stu- 
dent's life for lack of re- 
lationships with supportive 
people and institutions. The 
education is less broad in 
scope because of the limit- 
ing of extra-curricular in- 
put or informal discussion 
beyond the limits of class- 
room material. 

In short, the commuter 
student becomes more 
utilitarian and job orient- 
ed, holding the educational 
institution and Its Ideas at 
arm's lenght. Consequent- 
ly, the rate of his personal 
growth Is Impaired, his 
chance for an integrated, 
whole, healthy, life under- 
standing Is jeopardized. 

Discussion of these 
studies further resulted In

Procedures used 
in constructing 
tite questionnaire 
and coilecting 
the data 



Step gns 

Mr. Smith complied ques- 
tions for a preliminary 
questionnaire using. In ad- 
dition to his own. Informa- 
tion from student surveys 
taken at: 

1. Indiana University 
Northwest Campus - 
Anonymous Student Survey, 
1969 

2. Indiana University - 
Fort Wayne Dormitory 
Survey, 1970 

3. Indiana University - 
Bloomington Survey, 1970 

4. Indiana University - 
Division of General and 
Technical Studies, 1969- 
70-71 

5. Indiana University - 
South Bend, 1971 

6. Flordia Junior College, 
1971 

7- Auburn University, 1970 

8. Educational Testing 
Services, 1965 

9. Indiana University - 
Bloomington - Student 0- 
plnion Survey, 1970 

10. I.U. - P.U. Fort Wayne 
Activities Questionnaire, 
1971 

11. I.U. Southeast, 1971 New 
Student 

This preliminary In- 
strument underwent 
further refinement by com- 
mittee members Including 
the rewriting of all ques- 
tions by Dean Lantz and 
Mr. Motto for Mark Sense 
responses. Following this, 
the questionnaire was 
"pre-tested" by one of Dr. 
Bruening's philosophy 
classes and additional 
changes were made as a 
result of this feedback. 
f j^ep X wo: 

Using a table of random 
numbers, the names of 502 
students were drawn for the 
study which constituted 10% 
of the 5,020 undergraduate 
students enrolled at the 
Indiana - Purdue Campus 
during the 1972 Spring 
Semester. 
Step Three: 

Questionnaires, cover 
letters and reply envelope 
were mailed to the 502 
sample population o n 
March 16, 1972. 
Step Four: 

After a two week waiting 
period, foUowuplocaltele- 
phone calls were made by 
five students to those In- 
dividuals who had not re- 
turned the questionnaire. 
A total of 233(46% of the 
random sample) com- 
pleted questionnaires were 
obtained from the mailing 
and follow up calls. 
Step Five: 

Using the resources of 
the Computer Center, Dr. 
Skelton and Dean Lantz 
summarized and tabulated 
Che data. 



Given the frequency data, 
Mr. Motto then drafted 
interpretive generalization 
statements for the com- 
mittee's reaction and 
further refinement. 

Interpretation of 
data 

Student Profile: 

If one were asked to 
stereotype the "average" 
student at Indiana-Purdue 
Fort Wayne, something like 
the following might be close 
to correct. He is white, 
unmarried, and between 
age 19-21. His family Is 
middle-class, but not nec- 
essarily white - collar. 
Probably neither parent 
has attended college. Ob- 
viously such a stereotype 
Is not totally accurate, but 
for first impressions It 
seems fair. 

The representation of 
minorities Is very low, but 
the average Income of the 
student's family Is quite 
high. It would be Inter- 
esting to correlate the non- 
white student's answer to 
questions relating to fam- 
ily Income and job type. 
One suggestion that might 
be valid Is that the average 
student Is a member of 
middle - America, more 
Iberal, politically, than 
parents, but not too left 
of center; moderately to 
seriously Interested In 
grades; and almost equally 
divided between college as 
a necessity for a good Job 
and college as a source of 
Intellectual development. 

Campus Involvement 

The survey suggested that 
the student population Is 
fairly mobile with about 
38% of the students plan- 
ning to complete their de- 
gree elsewhere. Another 
aspect of this mobility can 
be measured by the fact 
that approximately 37% of 
the student body are trans- 
fer students In which a ma- 
jority of them transferred 
more than a year's aca- 
demic credit. Of the stu- 
dents surveyed, the mean 
grade Index falls within the 
B range. 

In regard to professor- 
student relationships, the 
vast majority of students 
surveyed have had contact 
with their professors about 
both class and casual mat- 
ters. Although students talk 
with professors about o- 
ther matters besides aca- 
demic, 30% have never seen 
a professor for reasons o- 
ther than academic. Of 
Interest, If not surprising, 
is chat of preferences for 
personal counseling. Of 
the various categories of 
possible university related 
counselors (excluding stu- 
dents), professors were the 
most preferred. The stu- 
dents who participated In 
the survey responded fa- 
vorably to questions rating 
vorably to questions re- 
lating to rating or fairness 
of professors. 



The response Indicated 
a low, but evenly distrib- 
uted participation in ex- 
tra - curricular activi- 
ties. The largest deterrent 
Co participation was work- 
ing hours. Rating second, 
but with nearly a third of 
the total response is "lack 
of interest." Expense did 
not seem to be of much 
concern. 

Of the facilities sur- 
veyed, few are being used 
to their fullest extent. 0- 
ver half of the respondents 
(54.2%) did not know the 
Psychological Testing and 
Counseling Service ex- 
isted. Of those students 
who were aware of Its ex- 
istence, only 13 had made 
use of the facilities. Al- 
though few students have 
used the placement facil- 
ities, most did know of its 
existence. More Informa- 
tion relating to the use of 
the counseling center fol- 
lows later in this report. 
The library facilities were 
not used by the students for 
study purposes. Instead, 
71% of the respondents 
study mainly at home. A- 
bout half of the students 
find the library policies 
convenient, although 1/4 of 
the students did not know 
what the policies were. 

The student lounge is 
used by less than half (45%) 
of the students and then 
mostly for casual activi- 
ties,, Th^.cafeferla ee^pis 
to be the most significant 
place for casual contact. 
Although only a small per- 
centage, 26%, used It for 
meals, the largest single 
response to the question 
about which groups gave 
students a sense ofbelong- 
Ing was "a group which 
meets in the cafeteria." 
If consideration Is given to 
the fact that the cafeteria 
is much more a place of 
association by choice, the 
significance of the cafe- 
teria for a sense of in- 
volvement Is crucial. 

The bookstore Is used 
frequently although a maj- 
ority of students have 
claimed to have difficulty 
getting textbooks. The re- 
sponse to the APO Book 
Exchange was favorable al- 
though only about 37% of 
the students have used It. 
One-third of the respon- 
dents look to campus as a 
primary source of friend- 
ship, and 51% feel no group 
unity or have no opinion a- 
bout It. As noted before, 
where groups occur which 
give some feeling of be- 
longing, these generally 
happen outside structured 
programming. In areas like 
the cafeteria. In fact, more 
than half claimed commu- 
nity groups which met in 
a casual area. Slightly 
fewer claimed groups 
which met In a particular 
class or department. Much 
below these, students 
claimed community related 
to particular student ac- 
tivities or organizations.

ECK lecture 
Tuesday 

On Tuesday, November 
21, at 8 p.m., there will 
be a lecture and discussion 
on ECKANKAR: "The An- 
cient Science of Soul Tra- 
vel." ECKANKAR, or ECK, 
Is not a yoga, religion, 
philosophy, metaphysical 
system, or an occult sci- 
ence. It does not use drugs, 
hyponosls, or other arti- 
ficial means of conscious- 
ness expansion. 

ECKANKAR teaches that 
the heavenly worlds are 
comprised of several plans 
of existence, each denot- 
ing a certain amount of 
spiritual growth and level 
of c onscious ness. 
Throughout history, man- 
kind has been told that the 
normal evolutionary pro- 
cedure Is ascension into 
these planes following 
death. 

ECK, however, bases 
Itself on the premise that 
death need not be man's 
only ticket to the heavenly 
regions. 

The lecture is open to 
all students and faculty,

Dr. Gottlieb leads battle 
against ^eco-pornography'; 

students urged to help 



Dr. Sheldon F. Gottlieb of 
the biology department of 
Purdue University at Fort 
Wayne Is leading an all-out 
campaign against the ad- 
venlsements currently be- 
ing run In local media by 
Indiana and Michigan Elec- 
tric Company. Thel&amp;Mads 
state that due to Increased 
demands for power, we may 
be facing an electric power 
shortage. These ads are 
misleading and extremely 
one-sided, Gottlieb says. 
Furthermore, they give a 
false Impression ofthena- 
ture of the energy crisis. 

At the present time, the 
major source of power In 
this country Is obtained 
from burning fossil fuel, 
the most Important of which 
Is coal. Indiana and Michi- 
gan Electric Company Is 
said to realize this and is 
most reluctant to tell the 
public the wholw story. 

When coal burns It not on- 
ly produces much particu- 
late matter such as soot and 
ash, but also sulfur oxides. 
Sulfur oxides are extreme- 
ly degrading to our envi- 
ronment and are potentially 
toxic to life. However, Ind- 
iana and Michigan present- 
ed this information In a 
manner astolmplythatdlf- 
fuslon of the gas In the up- 
per atmosphere along with 
chemical changes render 
the sulfur oxides harmless. 
This Is not true. 

In the Journal-Gazette's 
"Letter to the Editor" sec- 
tion of October 16, 1972, 
Dr. Gottlieb called this kind 
of advertising "eco-porno- 
graphy"and "industrial 
blackmail." One question 
that one might ask himself 
is "How long will we go on 

Ping-pong 

tourney 

planned 

The Students' Govern- 
ment Is sponsoring an in- 
tramural ping-pong tour- 
nament beginning Tuesday, 
November 28, and lasting 
through Friday, December 
1. Time of matches Is 5 
p.m. to 8 p.m. 

From November 14, a 
sign-up sheet for interes- 
ted students has been posted 
near the ping-pong tables. 
The schedule of matches 
win be posted on Novem- 
ber 21. Last day to sign 
up for the tourney is Nov- 
ember 20. 

Failure to show for a 
scheduled match results in 
an automatic forfeit. If 
both players are absent at 
the scheduled time of the 
mitch, both will be eli- 
minated. 



breathing toxic air before 
we demand that regulations 
and controls are en- 
forced?" 

The federal government 
has instituted new air pol- 
lution control standards to 
be met by 1975. Indiana and 
Michigan's reaction? "Ex- 
treme and Impractical." 

There are reasons to be- 
lieve that I&amp;M's statement 
Is false. Nashville, Tenne- 
ssee has developed a sys- 
tem whereby they can sup- 
ply their whole city of 447, 
877 population plusalltheir 
industry with all the elec- 
tric power theyneed with 
almost no sulfur oxide 
emission. It hopefully will 
be completed by 1974. It Is 
based on the burning of mu- 
nicipal wastes rather than 
fossil fuels. It makes one 
wonder why Fort Wayne 
cannot do the same? 

To combat these mislead- 
ing advertisements. Dr. 
Gottlieb, who also repre- 
sents the Coalition for En- 
vironment, a local ecolo- 
gical group of which he is 
past president, has been 
working to obtain equal 
time in the local radio and 
TV stations. He has been 
assisted by IPU student' Ann 
Steele of the Circle K Club 
in making phone calls and 
writing letters to various 
places. 

Radio station WLYV was 
the first to respond In a 
positive way to the efforts. 
The station aired free 60- 
second spots all this week. 

So far, no other radio sta- 
tions have responded, but It 
was learnedthat WOWOhas 
refused to accept the 1 &amp; M 



"Irankly Speaking" 



WANE-TV turned Its Sun- 
day evenlngprogram, "Fo- 
cus 15" over to Dr. Gott- 
lieb and Thomas Dustin of 
the Izaak Walton League. 
The two responded to the 
I&amp;M ads and discussed the 
emergency energy crisis. 

Negotiations are being 
made with WKJG - TV a- 
bout the possibility of giving 
free time. Dr. Gottlieb has 
yet to hear from WPTA- 

TV and radio stations. ' 

The questionis, "Whatcan 
Interested persons do?" 

Each student Is urged to 
write Individual letters to 
I&amp;M. In these letters, they 
should object to the quality 
of the I&amp;M ads and the u- 
sage of the money for ads 
when it Is needed for re- 
search. They should also 
send "Thank-you" letters 
to WLYV, WANE, and the 
FCC for the free time that 
was given. 

In addition to needing 
people to write letters. Dr. 
Gottlieb needs people to 
help htm in research. Any- 
one willing to give a little 
time for a worthy cause' 
should contact Dr. Gottlieb 
immediately.

racks on campus. Two of 
these are located on the

Internal Problems to In- 
volvement: 

Several factors contri- 
bute to the personality pro- 
file of the Indiana- Purdue 
Fort Wayne Campus as 
preceived by its students, 
Indiana-Purdue ispredom- 
inamly the first choice 
(64.6%) or second- choice 
(18,9%) of the students as 
they select an institution 
of higher education. Con- 
venience (39.6%) and in- 
expenslveness (25,9%) are 
the primary reasons for 
attending this campus ra- 
ther than available pro- 
grams (17.8%) or school 
reputation (8.4%), The ma- 
jor reasons for being in 
college are stated to be 
the necessity of a college 
degree to get a good job 
(44.7%) and intellectual de- 
velopment (42,7%). On a 
one (very good) to five (ve- 
ry poor) scale, the overall 
experience with Indiana- 
Purdue is rated 2.42, 

The "atmosphere" of 
the Indiana- Purdue Fort 
Wayne Campus Is gener- 
ally described as a re- 
gional campus of a uni- 
versity (39.3%) or a high 
school (25.3%), although no 
opinion {23.()%) is also ap- 
parent. The campus Is 
primarily viewed as con- 
tributing to the students' 
goals to the extent of some- 
what (43.9%) and a lot 
(36.1%). If a dormitory 
were available on this cam- 
' pus and included married 
housing, 73.9% of the re- 
sponses Indicated no de- 
sire to pursue residence. 
Successful academic pro- 
gramming experiences are 
dependent upon several 
factors. During the regis- 
tration process, problems 
are encountered due to one 
or more closed classes 
(35.7%) and class schedule 
addendum changes (40.8%) 
one or more times. The 
total class load of more 
than one fifth of the stu- 
dents (21.4%) is restricted 
to classes which meet at 
4:30 p.m. or after. How- 
ever, 56.8% of all re- 
sponses indicate that one or 
more classes have been un- 
available at 4:30 p.m. or 
after. A balanced variety 
of reasons for dropping 
courses includes changed 
work schedule (23.5%) 
poor university counseling 
(21.6%), and wrong course 
(19,6%). 

Calendar perference rel- 
ative to the new end- 
before - Christmas sche- 
dule Indicates 72,8% for, 
3% against, and 24.1% who 
had not experienced the 
old back-after-Chrlstmas 
schedule. Summer classes 
are preferred after 4:30 
p.m. by 42,8%, before 4:30 
p.m. by 25,6%. and during 
a two or theee week con- 
centrated period by 31.6%. 
Scheduling of a three hour 
course Is preferred on the 
basis of two meetings a 
week (43.7%), three meet- 
ings a week (35.0%), and 
once a week (21.3%). The 
personal importance at- 
tached to good grades Is 
primarily quite a bit 



(35,2%) and a moderate a- 
mount (33.0%), 

Interest in politics Is 
evidenced by the facts that 
85.4% of the students are 
registered to vote and 
55.7% voted in the last e- 
lection. The studentsclas- 
Blly themselves as basic- 
ally moderate (43.4%) and 
fairly liberal (31.2%) poli- 
tically, 

External Prnhlfmfi 

rn Invnlvement: 

The parking lots do not 
lie - 72% of the respon- 
dents drive their own cars 
and another 16% drive their 
parent's car. This means 
that 88% of the students 
are commuting as drivers. 
Only 9% of the respondents 
claim to ride with someone. 
Thirty-nine percent of the 
respondents come more 
than ten miles to campus 
and all but 5% come two 
or more times a week -the 
largest percentage, 59%, 
make the trip five or more 
times a week - It would 
appear that distance may 
have some effect on extra 
campus activities. 70% In- 
dicated that they come to 
campus less than once a 
week on the average other 
than for classes. 

Over two-thirds of the 
respondents work. Forty- 
three percent claim to work 
from 31 to over 40 hours 
a week. This last figure 
substantiates the large 
number who classify their 
jobs as professional, man- 
,agerlal, skilled or super- 
visory. The questions 
which come to mind In deal- 
ing with these figures Is 
how they might correlate 
to marital status, academic 
load, campus Involvement, 
etc. Work Is given as the 
most frequent reason 
for non - Involvement In 
campus life. 

Continuation of Indivi- 
dual development Includes 
the provision of campus 
services. The primary 
needs for counselors are 
expressed to be the areas 
of educational - vocational 
goals (21.8%) and personal 
Identity (13,1%). A coun- 
seling and testing center 
(34.4%) is the most likely 
souce from which students 
would seek assistance In 
promoting their personal 
growth and development. 
The selection of a coun- 
selor for personal prob- 
lems Includes 63.7% from 
non - university personnel 
and is evenly distributed 
between a non - student 
friend (17.1%), parent or 
relative (14,5%), and fel- 
low student (14.5%); of the 
university professional 
personnel (36,3%), prefer- 
ence is expressed for fac- 
ulty (11.7%) and the coun- 
sellne office (9.4'£). 

Employment intentions af- 
ter college relative to geo- 
graphic location predom- 
1 nantly indicate ' 'any- 
where" (58,5%), and north- 
east Indiana (33,9%). It 
Is Interesting that more 
than half see their job as 
related to their educational 
goals. How many of these 
are older students, mar- 
ried and established, who 
are seeking to upgrade 
their credentials where 



they are, as opposed to 
those who are beginning or 
are yet to start establish- 
ing themselves? The for- 
mer category may be more 
heavily populated than pop- 
ularly Imagined. Thereare 
12% of the respondents who 
claim their employers are 
directly paying part of their 
educational expenses 
These facts certainly add 
to the image of a signifi- 
cant number who are In the 
"upgrading" category. 

Over half of the respon- 
dents live with their pa- 
rents, roughly a fourth are 
established In their own 
residences and another 
fourth rent. Living at home 
seems to cause little prob- 
lem In terms of family re- 
sponBlbllltles when asked 
about directly In terms of 
living with parents. The 
much larger number 
claimed family obligations 
as a deterrent to extra- 
curricular involvement or 
program attendance, prob- 
ably are the more estab- 
lished, married students 
with children. There is 
significant conflict between 
students and parents. 
These conflicts seem to re- 
flect the typical problems 
of the youth culture. These 
conflicts In rank order are 
religious and moral values, 
mode of dress and general 
appearance, hours they 
keep, finances, friends, and 
career. 

More than half of the re- 
spondents discuss what 
they are learning with pa- 
rents with little or no prob- 
lems, but the others either 
do not talk with their par- 
ents about their learning or 
do so in spite of rather 
strong conflict. Married 
students present a differ- 
ent type of conflict arena 
and their major area of 
conflict is absence from the 
family, finances, and lack 
of encouragement from the 
spouse. Perhaps this Is not 
as surprising as one might 
assume since approxi- 
mately half of all spouses 
have had no educational ex- 
periences beyond high 
school. 

When asked In what areas 
the university needs coun- 
selors, the largest number 
marked "educational/ vo- 
cational goals." This re- 
sponse seems to fit both 
the statements as to why 
students were in college 
" to get a good job" and 
the concern at being un- 
decided as to vocation 
goals. The response of 
"personal identity" had the 
second largest response. 
All other responses were 
chosen equally, the other 
choices were: drugs; draft; 
religious/ moral concerns; 
human relations training; 
unwanted pregnancy; per- 
sonal identity; study skills 
Improvement; parental 

conflict; and marital prob- 
lems. 

The largest percentage 
of respondent (70) said that 
they would use the Psycho- 
logical Counseling and 
Testing Service as a help 
for personal growth and de- 
velopment. The number 
who would use the Coun- 
seling Center with person- 
al problemsdropsmarked- 



ly. 

When questioned regard- 
ing with whom they would 
discuss personal prob- 
lems, the students selec- 
ted the following listed in 
rank order: 

1. Friend who is not a 
student. 

2. Parent or other rela- 
tive. 

3. Fellow student. 

4. Member of the faculty. 

5. Minister of their own 
church, 

6. A counselor from the 
university counseling of- 
fice. 

7. A professional non- 
unlverslty counselor. 

8. A faculty or school 
advisor, 

9. Campus minister, 

10. A dean. 

All this could mean: 

1) students do not prefer 
to be identified with their 
problems at the university, 

2) the students may be re- 
luctant to identify the prob- 
lem as "major" enough to 
seek professional help, 3) 
problem is not of a magni- 
tude that requires profes- 
sional counseling, 4) the 
university counseling has 
been Identified as educa- 
tional / vocational - per- 
sonal growth oriented as 
opposed to problem solving 
of a very personal nature. 

A s might be surmised 
from the surrounding com- 
munity with its large num- 
bers of Roman Catholics 
and more conservative 
Protestant bodies, the stu- 
dents are more Involved 
in religion than one might 
guess of an "average stu-'" 
dent body." The figures 
may be higher because of 
the larger percentage of 
"established" students. 
This Involvement surely 
accounts for the large pre- 
ference of their own minis- 
ters a s a source of coun- 
seling on personal prob- 
lems. 

Over 90% of the respon- 
dents feel that they are, 
at least to some degree, 
religious. Perhaps this 
fact has great Implications 
to the age, marital status, 
goals, parental relation- 
ship and motivation of our 
student population. 

Conclusions 

1. The undergraduate pop- 
ulation is predominately 
white, 3/5 male, unmar- 
ried, between 19-21, It Is 
largely mlssle class but not 
necessarily white collar. 
The majorlcy are forst 
generation college stu- 
dents, 

2. The reasons given for 
choosing this campus, to-, 
gether with the few students 
who plan to transfer to the 
main campuses, suggest 
that students are 
minimumly concerned a- 
bout the relationship to the 
main campuses and that 
institutional autonomy 
would not necessarily af- 
fect student enrollment. 
There is some evidence 
that thecampusalreadyhas 
some distinctiveness In Its 
own right In the minds of 
the students. 

3. Student selectlonof this; 
campus Is clearly not a 
'last resort' decision, al- 



though convenience and In- 
expenslveness are In- 
fluential factors. 

4. With primary emphasis 
on job orientation and in- 
teUectual development, 
students relate a very pos- 
itive attitude toward ex- 
periences with the campus 
and its contribution to the 
fulfillment of their goals. 

5. The present academic 
calendar Is quite satisfact- 
ory, 

6. Students are willing to 
be very mobile withrespect 
to employment after col- 
lege, 

7. Students are political- 
ly moderate to fairly 
liberal with a general in- 
terest in politics, but few 
see themselves as now or 
ever being politically 
catlve. 

8. In comparsion to others 
on the political spectrum, 
students generally had no 
Idea about the faculty views, 
idea about the faculty views, 
felt that fellow students 
were slightly more liberal, - 
but perceived parents as 
more conservative. 

9. The relatively strong 
religious background and 
concern of the students Is 
consistent with community 
and personal ■ charr^y/ 
acterlstics. ... 

10. The commuter aspect ■ 
of the camiijs contributes 
to a f'- gmented student 
life bLL also provides the 
rather unique opport- 
unities for community In- 
volvement through the stu- 
dents' parents, employers, 

_ personal afiaocj||itjcgjjj^«-» 
' such as: parent Orientation, 
unique programs of con- 
tinuing education, increase 
employer relationship with 
students in financial help 
and educational goals, 
spouse and family geared 
programs, etc, 

11. Our servicing com- 
munity Is and win be Qfj^^ 
major significance to the 
life of this campus. 

Implications 

I, There are some dis- 
undergraduate population 
that deserve special con- 
cern from the university, 
particularly because they 
give the campus popula- 
tion a "personality" con- 
sistent with a commuter 
campus. 

A. Specifically, there 
needs to be particular con- 
cern for the large number 
of married "established' 
students. Day care is need- 
ed. Programs and 
activities geared to a more 
,ature student are desir- 
able. 

C. Channels for address- 
ing the parents of first 
generation students, es- 
pecially where the student 
lives with the family need 
to be explored to inter- 
pret a "supportive" role for 
the parents. 

D, Special attention should 
continue to be given In the 
area of financial aids to 
the large number of stu- 
dents who come from large 
families where more than 
one student is in college.

''Bone"- a not so funny Byrd flies high 
satire on Amercan life 



by Anita Lamos 



by Sue Perrine 



"Bone," the "hilarious 
picture," now playing ac 
the Embassy Theatre, Is a 
not BO funny satire on A- 
merlcan way of life today,. 

Bill Leonard, pt .yed by 
Andrew Duggan, is a 
well-off car salesman wtio 
lies CO his customers, his 
wife, and his friends for 
reasons he deems neces- 
sary. 

His ugliest lie, is the lie 
about his son. His son is 
in Italy serving a six-year 
sentence for trying to 
smuggle drugs. According 
to Bill, though, he is sup- 
posed to be in Viet Nam 
serving as a lieutenant hel- 
icopter driver. Although 
Bin is able to help his 
son, he does not provide 
that help. It might hurt 
his Image if his custom- 
ers and friends found out 
the truth. 

Bone, portrayed as 7 
thief and rapist by Yaphet 
Katto, enters the home of 
the Leonards to discover 
that although rhey live in 
the most expensive house 
In the neigtiorhood, they 
are broke. Bone then goes 
on to discover a "secret" 
bank account chat Bill has 
for his own personal use. 
Bill has obtained a large 
amount of money by steal- 
ing from his wife. The 
money from this account 
Is demanded by Bone or 
else he promises to rape 
and klU Bill's wife. 

When Bill doesn't return 



from bis trip to the bank, 
the rape Is Interrupted only 
by Bernadetce, the wife 
played by Joyce VanPatten, 
seducing the rapist. This 
backward arrangement Is 
Just a sample of how "hi- 
larious" this movie Is. 
Bill's failure to return 
to the rescue of his wife 
is due to the fact that he 
is trying to decide whe- 
ther to loose his money 
or his wife. In the 
meantime. Bill gets tied 
up with a young woman who 
Is a victim of the society 
she was raised In. This 
young woman is played by 
JeaniUe Berlin. Being mo- 
lested as a child, she is 
convinced that she Is not fit 
for any one man, so she 
consequently goes to bed 
with any and all men. 

The show Is ended with 
Bernadette and Bone chas- 
ing Bill to kill him and 
collect the Insurance. The 
final scene shows Berna- 
dette lying to the police 
after she killed her hus- 
band and was desened by 
Bone. In Bone's desertion 
he realizes he can be of no 
help CO Bernadette, nor Is 
he going to gain anything 
by hanging around. 

If the mov^e "Bone" Is 
viewed as the satire that 
it Is supposed to be. It 
could be a sell-out. After 
all, the movie Is a mock- 
ery of what might be hap- 
pening In somefamiliesto- 
day, and that is really 
"hilarious." 



Guitar artistry is Charlie 
Byrd. In a variety of 
rhythms from latin toblu«B 
ana moods from classic to 
country, he proved this fact 
Wednesday afternoon. 

With all the sensitivity 
showing In his face, the 
master of the guitarplayed 
his innermost feelings. 

The Concerto In D by 
Vivaldi was extremely well 
liked by the audience who 
gave Byrd a standing o- 
vatlon at the end of the 
first movement. 

In Vifew^ 



After the Intermission 
some hit cunes were played 
to perfection followed by 
more latin sounds. 

Backed by drums and 
bass guitar, Charlie Byrd 
provided some of the moat 
listenable music anyone 
could want. 

Such a concert should be 
well attended, listen ed to, 
and appreciated. Of the 
crowd of a couple hundred 
only fifty or so stayed to 
the end. Convocation 
Series Is for you - where 
were you? 



World of Carl 
Sandburg ' outstanding 



by Sue Perrine 



The play, "The World of 
Carl Sandburg", put on by 
PIT on Friday the 10th, was 
an outstanding production. 
The time and effort of the 
cast made this well written 
play quite exceptional. 

Each person In the play 
was not given a role of a 
character, but rather, each 
was an enthusiast of Carl 
Sandburg. Each line was 
read with the sincerity, hu- 
mor, mockery or sarcasm 
that Carl Sandburg would 
have used, and not that of 
each individual. Every 
emotion Ima^nable was 
written Into this play, and 
everyone of these emotions 
were characterized, by the 
cast, in a way to reflect 



Carl Sandburg. 

This play was written Ina 
way to show every facet 
of Carl Sandburg's writ- 
ings. This play depicted 
birth, death, hate,love, 
friends, enemies, family, 
laughter and all other parts 
of life, and all of which are 
part of Carl Sandburg's 
writings. 

This play was great, but' 
its success cannot be given 
to only one person. Norman* 
Corwin wrote this fantas- 
tic play but Che case made 
It into what It was. PIT Is 
bound to become even more 
popular if it continues with 
plays like this, for this play 
was the bestadvenlsement 
they could have. 



Study.., 

(Con't from p. 8) 

2. A variety of course 
offerings in summer school 
Is desirable. Two or three 
week concentrated courses 
are desirable. 

3. A better coordinated 
and more stable schedule 
of classes should be de- 
veloped. (Closed classes, 
addendum, meetings per 
week, etc.) 

4. The scheduleof classes 
should be more responsive 
to evening needs of stu- 
dents (after 4:30). 

5. The mobility factor of 
students does not tend Co 
dlscract from a satisfact- 
ory reansltlon Into the ac- 
ademic life of the Institu- 
tion but participation In 
non-academic activities is 
deterred by such factors as 
working hours, lacK oi in- 
terest, established com- 
munity ties, etc. Thus the 
planning for non-academic 
Involvement must consider 
relatively unlqueaspectsto 
provide opportunities for a 
total development of stu- 
dents (i.e., casual contact 
with professors and ad&gt; 
mlnlstrators, open periods 
within day schedules, etc.) 

Particular concern should 
be given to space utiliza- 



tion across the campus. 
Priority should be given to 
deverse areas for casual 
student - faculty contract - 
diverse In terms of usage 
(quite lounges, music and 
T.V. lounges, coffee 
lounges, recreation, etc.) 
and in terms of relation- 
ship (departmental lounges, 
faculty lounges, areas re- 
lated to student services, 
student government, ad- 
ministrative offices, etc.) 

6. Definice needs exist to 
familiarize scudenc with 
campus services already 
available and encourage 
their use. 

7. A variety of counsel- 
ing services are needed. 
Career counseling ser- 
vices are highly desirable. 
Significant need exists as 
well for a» variety of per- 
sonal kinds of counseling: 
personal development, 
study help, etc. 

8. Attention needs to be 
given to establishing clear 
referral patterns between 
all counseling done In Che 
university and perhaps 
clearer Ualson with coun- 
seling services outside the 
university. 

9. Information relative to 
tucoriai services for stu- 
dents needs to be provided 
and some additional pro- 
grams explored. 

10. The high school pre- 



paration of students on this 
campus is weak In develop- 
ing study habits and vo- 
cational plans but satis- 
factory In personal -social 
relations. While this has 
particular implications for 
area high schools. It means 
as well that the University 
must develop concerned 
programs for undecided 
students. 

This means not only 
functional exploratorycur- 
ricula with guidance and 
counseling but also, ' we 
feel, curricula which have 
practical as well as 
theoretical contact with 
yocacional goals. Addition-

ally, faculty teaching fresh- 
man level courses should 
give special accention to Che 
teaching of study skills re- 
quired for their courses, 
11. We feel, somewhat un- 
clearly but enough to men- 
tion, chat there are Im- 
plications In this data that 
require raising questions 
about education of 
"values", especially with 
regard to student percep- 
tions of faculty. While ob- 



jectivity and balance are 
necessary virtues In teach- 
ing, we would hope that 
Increased casual contact 
between students and 
faculty would provide more 
personal "value models' Co 
aid the growth and whole- 
ness of students.

Balance is word in tite NFL 

The age of the great football dynasties seems to be over. 
Pro football today 1b so balanced by the complicated player 
draft chat It appears highly unlikely chat fans will ever see 
the likes of VinceLombardl'sGreenBaydynasty of the '60e 
again. 

Through the first eight gamesonlyone of the 26 NFL clubs 
iB unbeaten, and only one has lost ]ust a single tilt. Those 
two elites, Miami (8-0), and Washington (7-1), three years 
ago were the doormats of their respective divisions. Each 
NFL team has dented the win column, and all but three have 
won at least two games. No Sunday bets are safe; upsets 
have been a dime a dozen. 

Last Sunday six teams had to prove themselves. Among 
those six were three powerhouses who had to prove they 
were still alive. Each had been playing highly erratic foot- 
ball and was In desperate need of a win. And each one 
of the three came through. The L.A, Rams and Roman 
Gabriel stopped rival Atlanta 20-7. The Minnesota Vikings 
regained their lost scoring punch and blasted New Orleans 
37-6, And Kansas City erased Oakland 27-14 to regain 
first place from the Raiders, 

Three other teams had to prove that they were really 
for real. One did. Green Bay did the job by handling 
San Francisco 34-24. That could be their highest point 
total since the days of LombardI, But the Chicago Bears 
and the Bengali from Clncy fared less well. The Bears 
figured they could whup anybody after taking the Vikings 
13-10 and St. Louis 27-10 In their two previous outings. 
But they had their hands full with that unpredictable 
den of Lions In Detroit. Detroit only managed what they 
started the game with,... nothing. 

The Bengals started their game with Pittsburgh with a 
5-2 slate. After blanking hapless Houston the week before, 
the Bengals thought they were headed straight fro the 
Super Bowl. They had beaten Pittsburgh {also 5-2) 
earlier In the season, and were extremely confident 
of a repeat. But on the first offensive play Bengal 
QU Ken Anderson fumbled and the tone was set. Final 
k%ll)F.*«g|eeler640, Bengals 17, 

Ti&gt;e Itest-paying American sport? Try golf I 

"Play basketball, young man. That's wherethemoneyls," 
You may disagree with that advice. But which sport, then, 
would you choose? Football? Pro baseball? 

Have you ever checked the money stats In professional 
golf? Do you realize how many progolfersare getting rich 
hitting that little ball around In such places as Las Vegas, 
Palm Springs, and Pebble Beach? 

No less than 16 pros have already eclipsed the paltry 
sum of $100,000 this yearl 50 men are over the ?50,000 
mark. Over a hundred golfers have garnered over $20,000 
already. Lanny Wadklns, 23and justoutofWake Forest, re- 
cently won his first professional tournament In Las Vegas, 
He picked up a $25,000 check (which should at lease cover 
his next grocery bill) and in theprocess just got by Arnold 
Palmer by one stroke. And what did Wadklns study in col- 
lege? Golf. He attended Wake Forest for three years on an 
Arnold Palmer golf scholarship. Sign me up Arnlel 

Arnold himself has had a rough year. His winnings now 
stand at a microscopic $70,000. So when you see him on TV 
next time, have a heart and puU for him all the way. He 
needs the bread to run his empire. 

Think about it 

Harland Svare, San Diego Chargers' coach, when In- 
terrupted by a ringing telephone during his speech before 
a weekly media luncheon: "If no one answer," quipped 
Svare, "It's Duane (Thomas)." 

Walt Garrison, Dallas running back, resting after a 
grueling practice session: "I'm so low I could wear a top 
hat and crawl under the belly of a snake." 

Tidbits from Derek Sanderson, who skipped from the 
NHL to the WHA and a $1.3 million contract: "Guys I've 
never heard of are running around like angry tigers 
trying to check me. They don't respect a guy anymore." 
And, "Nobody has as many name players as we do In our 
lineup. But It creates a problem. Everybody Is up for 
us. They think they are as good as we are," Through 
last Wednesday his team, the Philadelphia Blazers, had 
won two games.... while losing eleven, and were deep In 
the cellar of the World Hockey Association, 

Jack Nicklaus, pro golf king; "I knew it wasn't a good 
day to play golf. I knew If I had a good round I could win. 
I nearly did it," 

Well, double darn Jack. You'll do 'er next time, Nicholas' 
winnings thus far this year: $284,429.

K's pin season's hopes 
on hustling rookies 



by Leo Herendeen 



Ice Hockey Is Fort 
Wayne's only professional 
sport and has been played 
here for twenty-one years 
In the International Hockey 
League. The team Is named 
the Komets and often ref- 
erred to as the K's. The 
last championship Komet 
teams played the 1962-63 
and 1963-64 seasons. Only " 
In the recent seasons, the 
K's have been a contender 
In their league, Manager- 
Coach Mark Bolleau must 
once again form a potential 
winning team If the Komets 
are ever to be a ch£ij|Fif|U)n- 
team again. 



The Komets ha ve many 
new rookies this season 
which have boosted the ex- 
pectations of Coach Boll- 
eau. Dean Sheremeta, an 
early crowd favorite. Is a 
big left winger that has 
moved the. opposition's de- 
fense aside to assist In the 
team's scoring. Another 
rookie, Alan MacKenzle 
has played both defense and 
winger wlthagrtacflairfor 
checking and a p rsistance 
in getting control of the 
puck. Chick Balon Is new

Kotnets... 



(Con't from p. 11) 

to the team this season but 
had played for theK'seight 
years ago. Balon Is cur- 
rently the K's number two 
scorer and has been a great 
play maker. 

The regulars from last 
season's K's are Wayne 
Ego, Robbie Irons, "Terry 
Pembroke, and Bob Fltch- 
ner. These are not all of 
last year's players who 
have returned to the K's 
but are the players that 
Coach Bolleau has relied u- 
pon mostly to keep the K's In 
contention so far In the sea- 
son. Wayne Ego is K's 
scoring leader with six 
goals and ten assists. Bob 
Fltchner, a fighter on the 
Ice, Is a strong center and 
the K's number three scor- 
er. Robbie Irons is the 
goaltender and has done 
well in the nets thus far 
this season. Terry Pem- 
broke is the last line of de- 
fense for the K's and has 
blocked, checked, scram- 
bled, and confused the op- 
position. 

The Komets have recently 
shown more offensive and ' 
defensive play in the last 
week thenin earlier games. 
The spotlight was on a 
Komet rookie goaltender 
last week as 20-year-old 
Don Atchison was perfect 
in goal and allowed no 
goals for a 4-0 . win a- "" 
galnlet Toledo. During a 
game, the goaltender is 
often the inspiring factor to 
becoming winner and 
Atchison has perform ex- 
cellently in goal, as for of- 
fense, new additions of Ray 
Brownlee, Brian Walker, 
and Glen Toner have helped 
to spark the K's In a full 
wave of attack. The Komet 
offense has taken more 
control of the puck in their 
passing and clearing their 
own zone (taking the puck 
out of the end of their 
goal). The offense has 
placed more shots on goal 
for the K's than the op- 
position has on the K's 
goal. This Is a good In- 
dication of how well the 
Komets are playing defense 
and offense. 

The Komets are current- 
ly In third place behind 
Dayton with 24 points and 
Des Moines with 16 points. 
The K's host Dayton here 
Saturday and play In Dayton 
Sunday which with a couple 
of wins would close gap In 
points. The Komets have 
14 points and the points 
are awarded by two for a 
win, one for a tie, and none 
for a lost. 

All in all, the K's are a 
hustling team this season 
and should be a pleasure to 
watch at the Coliseum. The 
next home games are: 

Flint Saturday Nov. 11 

Change after next home 

games are: 

Nov. 18 - Saturday- Dayton 

Nov, 23 - Thursday - Des

First-year tennis team 
finishes 5-4 



CLASSIFIEDS 



by Steve Butcher 



In Its first year at I-FU, 
the tennis team had a fine 
season. Under the direction 
of Dr. Chuck Bolyard and 
assistant coach Dr. Ben 
Becker, the team compiled 
a winning record of 5 wins 
and 4 losses. 

Dr. Chuck Bolyard of Bol- 
yard fame began hlscoach- 
Ing career at Ball State 
where In '6-1 and *62 he 
was an assistant coach as 
a graduate student. After 
earning his masters de- 
gree, he moved on to coach 
Southport High School in 
Indianapolis, Ind. Then he 
moved to Ft. Wayne where 
he assumed his present po- 
sition as head coach. 

The team wasrepresented 
by former area hlghschool 
standouts. Galen Yordy, 
John Saurer, Steve Spolt- 
man, Tom White, Dave Bu- 
slan, Tony Valentine, and 
Ken Bednar all won var- 
sity award letters. The rest 
of the team Included Mike 
Shone, Pat Scher, and Steve 
Beltz. 

The top-seeded player on 
the team was Galen Yordy. 
This capable junior played 
against the top player of 
each of the opposing 
schools. Although his Sand 
6 record is not the creden- 
tials of a winning athlete, 
he more than made up for 
this with his record of in- 
dividual effort and team 
spirit. The number two man 
on the team was Steve 
Spoltman. Playing the num- 
ber two man on each team 
this CIrcle-K member tal- 
lied a season record of 5 



and 4. He along with Dave 
Buslan had the best win- &gt; 
loss record on the team. 

Dr. Bolyard states that the 
toughest opponent this year 
was Notre Dame. Although 
their team blanked us 6-0, 
It must be taken Into con- 
sideration that Notre Dame 
gives two athletic scholar- 
ships and has 24 campus 
courts for play action. I-PU 
on the other hand has no 
athletic scholarships and no 
campus playing facilities. 
Although this cannot be 
used as an excuse for los- 
ing, lack of practice courts 
has been a factor effecting 
team play. Presently, the 
team practices at Lions 
Park which only has two 
courts. This seems to be 
the only practice area 
available. Also, the lU 
Bloomington campus offers 
35 tennis scholarships a 
year while here in Fort 
Wayne zero are offered. 
These two reasons, as Dr. 
Bolyard states, are the two 
biggest hangups for the ten- 
nis team right now. Hope- 
fully, with the construction 
of a new fieldhouse slated 
for 1976, and possibly ath- 
letic scholarships, the cal- 
iber of play will improve. 

At the present time short 
range plans include re- 
cruiting at local high- 
schools by the two coaches 
and a film series on tennis 
for all students to encour- 
age the growth of the sport 
here on campus. Many ten- 
nis buffs may also be happy 
to note that a tennis cUrUc 
Is planned for next Spring. 



B-ballers lose two in 
pre-season tourney 



In a pre-season tour- 
nament at Huntington, the 
I-PU Mastodon basketball 
team showed some real po- 
tential for the season to 
come, even though they 
came homt with two 
losses. 

In the opener on Monday, 
they lost to St. Francis 

by one point, 76-75. Then 
on Tuesday they nearly up- 
set highly-talented Marion, 
losing by just eight points. 

Tom Bernlng displayed 
that he should be playing 
Big Ten basketball by 
pumping in 23 points 
the first night, then add- 
ing 2,6 points against Mari- 
on. Gary Trump is guid- 
ing the team really well 
from his guard position, 
while Steve Yahn and Don 
Chaney, along with Ber- 
nlng, are controlling the 
b-Dards superbly. Mike Rich 
Is a sound fundamentalist 
guard, and Bruce Haines, 



Rex Putt, and Kent Rosen- 
■ berry have shown some 
bench strength. 

The Mastonds showprom- 
ise of being the best team 
ever this year. Let's show
