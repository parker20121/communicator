Thief nabs radar detector from car 



By J. Willjam Richardson 

Copy Editor 

A Sunday night theft from a 

vehicle parked outside of the 

new engineering building high- 
lights the need for students lo 
Lake precautions against parking 
lot crime, according to Sgi. Ron 
Mou of the university police 
and safety dcpanmeni, 

A tadar detector was stolen 
from the parked car Sunday 
nighl. Radar detectors, as well as 
other valuables such as purses, 
textbooks and compact discs, 
should be left at home, if possi- 
ble, or stowed in the glove com- 
panmeni or trunk of the vehicle, 
and not left in sight, said Molz. 

"A Student left two zippcrcd 
cases of CD's in the passenger 
seal , so he could get to them," 
Motz said, referring to a theft 
last semester, "Unfonunatciy, 
the thief could get to ihcm , too. 



He just broke the window and 
look Ihcm." 

Motz said that valuables left in 
plain view in an unattended 
vehicle attract theft. Motz noted 
thai textbooks arc especially vul- 
nerable, as they arc easily 
redeemable for cash. 
Traffic and Parking 

In related news, Motz was 
pleased with the traffic situation 
and noted thai parking, accidents 
and traffic flow problems have 
generally subsided for now. 

"The accidents have subsided, 
in general, for now, but students 
should exercise care when 
inclement weather arrives," said 
Motz, 

Motz added that students could 
help alleviate campus u-aTTic and 
parking problems by arriving 
earlier for class during high 
usage times of the week. 

High iralTic and parking facili- 



ty usage times are proportional 
to the number of students on 
campus at a given lime, said 




According to statistics com- 
piled by the rcgisuar's office, the 
number of students on campus is 
highest on Tuesday and 
Thursday mornings. Enrollment 



approaches 4000 students at 
these peak times, 

"While these numbers reflect 
the number of students enrolled 
for a given lime period, other 
students may be on campus for 
whatever reason," said Norman 
Grecnburg, associate registrar. 

Afternoons and evenings are 
marked by high enrollment 
Monday through Thursday, 
peaking from 7:00 until 8:00 
p.m., as students lake part in 
evening classes. 

Sgt. Tom Hancr said that 
while the campus may be crowd- 
ed, there is still open parking 
available. 

"Students .should try the lots in 
the north part of campus," said 
Haner, "These lots arc anything 
but full " 

"We haven't had any shonages 
of parking since the first week of 
school," Haner added. He also 



commended the students for 
their considerate behavior 
regarding the parking situation. 

Hancr also noted that the tem- 
porary closure of St. Joe Road 
was adding to the traffic woes on 
campus. 

"The road closure adds from 
3000 to 5000 car's per day to the 
traffic flow," He said, but he 
added that he was optimistic 
about the situation. 

Regarding the temporary clo- 
sure of St. Joe Road, Hancr was 
optimistic. 

"We've been assured that the 
intersection of St. Joe and 
Crescent will be open by the 
weekend," Haner said. 

"Overall, though, we've had 
very few problems. We've had a 
very pleasant first three weeks," 
said Mot/, adding, "1 hope to sec 
this peaceful trend continue 
diroughout the year."

Arts students say building 'stinks' 



By Jennifer O'Blenis 

StalT Wrtier 

and Mary Shrock 

Features Editor 

IPFW's new Fine Arts build- 
ing has received mediocre 
reviews from students. 

Students who remember the 
West Berry art studio claim 
the current building is less 
codusive to their artistic 
expression. 

"It's too sterile here at IPFW. 
1 like the old houses down- 
town, it was easier to let your 
mind go free and be artistic. 
Now I feel like I'm in a hospi- 
tal," said lim Burge, a sopho- 
more fine arts major. 

Freshman art major, Jcri Jo 



Taylor added that the smell of 
paint was disturbing, "I really 
don'i like the building. You 
can smell paint from one end 
of the building to another. 
Downtown, they had classes 
outside. I like that better," she 
said. 

Don Katier. director of the 
physical plant, said the fine 
arts classes had lo be moved 
onto campus because the 
West Berry location failed to 
meet safely and accessibility 
standards. 

"It was easier to build a new 
facility than to try to fix the 
West Berry houses," said 
Katier. 

One student said she pre- 
ferred the IPFW building to 



the former downtown location. 

"I love it here, because the 
facility and location is better. I 
like the atmosphere," said 
Angela Fritz, sophomore art 
education major. 

Students addressed the issue 
of landscaping outside the Fine 
Arts building. While most .stu- 
dents agreed the landscaping 
looks good, some said diat stu- 
dent landscapers, not outside 
contractors, should have done 
die work. 

"Why didn't they just hire 
horticultural students to plant 
the grass?" asked Blaising. 

An history teacher, Samaniha 
Birk, said the location is an 
advantage for students. She 
said it's easier for students 



who arc taking a variety of 
courses to attend classes in the 
Fine Arts building, radicr than 
downtown. 

"It has die advantage of feel- 
ing more like a part of a col- 
lege campus at IPFW." said 
Birk. 

Students also noted dial the 
lack of smoking lOunges 
makes it hard to socialize wiih 
fellow students. 

"They should have places for 
us to get together and smoke if 
we want to," said freshman an 
therapy major, Trish Rhodes. 

The most unusual comment 
was made by Rhodes who 
said, "Was die Fine Arts build- 
ing really built on a grave 
site?" 



Food Fight 

Price increase 
authorization 
in question 

By Sarah Jakacky 
Chief Reporter 

The Fort's increased expenses have 
led to a costlier and less meaty meal. 
However, Paul Strouts, director of 
purchasing, said the university did 
not approve ihc recent rate increases. 

According lo Stfouts IPFW is sup- 
posed to approve increases proposed 
by The Fort before the cafeteria can 
piocccd with changes. Strouts said 
die higher prices were not approved 
by the university. 

The cafeteria said they needed to 
raise prices because their operational 
expenses have gone up. 

Because IPFW receives a 50 per- 
cent commission on all profits 
derived from The Fort and all vend- 
ing machines, SU'ouis said the cam- 
pus has an interest in what The Fort 
docs. In fact, he said, the campus 
has control over The Fort even 
though they are not a university 
entity. 

Strouts said IPFW only makes 
about S2,500 each year from The 
Fort but grosses over SI14,000 
annually on vending machines. 

IPFW and the management of The 
Fort met on Tuesday to discuss 
price increases and other food ser- 
vice details. 

At press time Strouts was unsure 
of the specifics of die meeting. He 
did reveal that The Fort may be 
required to reduce its rates. 

Even though the campus nets a 
profit on The Fort's income, Strouts 
said they want lo keep prices low 
because it is in the best interests of 
die students. 

Money The Fort earns goes into a 
general fund pool that is calculated 
into the campus' annual income. 
When things like tuition rates need 
to be established, Strouts said they 
USE The Fort's income to keep 
tuition low. 

A follow-up Story will appear next 
week updating the events of 
Tuesdays meeting. 



Senate moving ahead 

Reps still needed 



By J. William Richardson 
Copy Editor 

With several exciting projects 
underway, the Students' 
Government has plunged head- 
long into the new academic year. 

Assembling a student discount 
listing from area businesses has 
been the first priority for the 
organization, according to 
Elbert Webster, vice presideni 
of legislation. 

The package will consist of 
special considerations 

redeemable by IPFW students 
for discounts at area businessses 
such as resiaraunts and movie 
theaters. 

"Discount plans may include 
'buy one, get one free' offers or 
offers redeemable for somcdiing 
like a large drink wiili the pur- 
chase of a sandwich," said Rajai 
Sun, student body president. 



Tentauve plans for a vicc-prcs- 
idcndal debate have fallen by die 




Elbert Webster 

wayside due to the unavailability 
of democratic candidate At 
Gore. 



Students' Government is still 
pursuing vice-president Dan 
Quaylc for a possible pre-elec- 
tion appearance on the IPfHV 
campus, according to Webster 

Many positions remain open 
on the senate, according to 
Webster, and interested students 
may pick up petitions at the 
Students' Govenment's office in 
Walb Memorial Union, Room 
225. 

"We're looking for people who 
can follow through," said 
Webster. 

Webster added that while the 
student senate still is not com- 
plete, projects arc being under- 
taken and completed. 

"Proper planning and follow 
through has been the key." said 
Webster,

Student apathy breeds 
missed opportunities 



Good morning. What we have in mind 
is breakfast in bed for 12,000. 

So wake up! 

The IPFW student senate has three 
members. There should be over 20- 

Most campus organizations are beg- 
ging for people to get involved. Why 
not join? 

Campus events are sparsely attended. 
Why not go? 

Wake up! You are in college, not in 
hell. 

STUDENTS' GOVERNMENT 

The IPFW Students' Government, or 
IPSGA, has our money. A large por- 
tion of the $35 student service fee we 
all pay each semester goes directly to 
IPSGA. 

IPSGA was allocated around 
$300,000 for this year. And a lot of that 
money can b6 thrown around in what- 
ever way desired by the government we 
have in office right now. 

As of last week, three senators "were 
responsible to make decisions that 
affect all of us. These three senators 
can write resolutions to spend our 
money, they can speak for our campus 
and they can decide on our future. 

We need more than three! 

It is easy to gel involved with student 
senate. Just stop by the IPSGA office 
in Walb emorial Union Room 225 to 
pick up a petition. 

As a member of student senate you 
can do something instead of just com- 
plaining about it. 

STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS 

Over 50 student organizations prowl 
the campus in search of both leaders 
and followers. 

Depanmenial clubs, honorary soci- 
eties, religious organizations, greek 
organizations and special-interest clubs 
provide an ample outlet for the energy 
of almost any IPFW smdent. 

From the fencing club to die psychol- 
ogy club interested students have the 
opportunity to become active in the 
campus environment. It is your respon- 
sibility to lake this opponunily. 



Intramural sports are an outlet for the 
compeiitive juices that build up through 
the academic year. From billiards to 
basketball, students are given the 
opporiunity to compete and experience 
new spons. 

Contribute to the Communicator. 
Writers, photographers and canoonists 
may submit their work to the 
Communicator office, Walb Memorial 
Union, Room 215. 

CAMPUS ACTIVITIES 

1. Attend movies on campus. 

For less money than it costs to rent, 
students can enjoy recent video releases 
with friends and fellow students. 
Every Wednesday and Thursday night 
at 7:30 p.m. a new movie is shown in 
CM 159. 

2. Palronize the PIT. 

Don't let the PlT's name fool you. 
There's nothing hellish about this inno- 
vative and culimg-edge theater. 
Throughout the school year the PIT 
produces plays ranging from Lu Ann 
Hampton Laverty Oberlander in 
October to Six Characters in Search of 
An Author in April. 

3. Share ideas and poetry wilh others. 
The Literary Revival Society meets 

every few weeks and offers a great 
opponunily to students of all majors to 
share with one another. Bring an origi- 
nal poem or read from the works of 
your favorite author. Talk about your 
favorite films. Just look for fliers to tell 
you when and where the next meeting 
is held, 

4. Show team spirit. 

IPFW's volleyball teams have distin- 
guished themselves as some of the best 
teams in the area. Students can attend 
many athletic events including tennis, 
soccer, baseball, cross country and bas- 
ketball free of charge when they pre- 
sent a student i.d, 

JUST DO IT 

The college experience is much more 
ihan going to class. There's things to do 
and people to meet. And IPFW offers it 
all, if students will just do it,

Nostalgic Snyder reflects on IPFW's last three years 



1 had decided that after three 
years of writing weekly tirades 
[o the editor and readers of The 
Communicator, and suffering 
ihc notoriciy - or I might say 
infamy - Ihat rcsulied, I would 
lay down my pen and fade inlo 
obscurity (if not lore) at IPRV. 
Ii was time to let others pro- 
mote pro[csI and change. 

Upon reading Ihc first Ihrcc 
issues of The Communicaior 
and noting not a single letter to 
The editor or any substantive 
issue on this campus. I find that 
I must resurrect my viiriolic 
pen and forego plans of early 
rctircmcni. 

Rather than engage in my 
characteristic attack on people, 
places, and things I think t( 
might be more valuable - espe- 
cially lo new students at IPFW 
- if I simply reflect, and in 
some instances reminisce, on 
changes and events that 1 have 
witnessed during my three 
years on this campus. 

THE FIRST VEAR 

In 1988-89. my first year at 
IPFW, there existed a cama- 
raderie among students that has 
since disappeared. In the days 
before nearly 20 pcrconl of the 
campus community was exiled 
lo the clemenLs, we social pari- 
ahs who enjoy the use of tobac- 
co products were allowed to 
engage in this social habit in 
Ihc lounges on each floor of 
Kciiler, Ihe lounges in Ihe 
Helmkc Library, as well as in 
the student union. Pardon me, 
the Walb Memorial Union. I 
tend to forget ihat we have no 

The Helmkc Library lounge 

being the "campus coffee 
house," a gathering place for 
students and faculty alike. 
Serious study, discussion, and 
yes play was the hallmark of 
"the lounge" as it was known 
throughout campus. It was ihc 
rallying poini for campus 
activists and radicals to gather 
and plan ways lo address issues 
on campus. As a result, it was 
also a point of &lt; 
campus administrators. 



place parkmg so parking was 
not the problem that it has 
become. 

There was no poster policy in 
enforcement to restrict and vio- 
late student's Fu^l Amendment 
rights. Students were able to 
park their vehicles at meters, 
parking fines were only S2, a 
meal at the Fort was under S2, 
candy bars and soft drinks 
were only 50 ccnls, Ihc library 
was open until midnight, and 
you could enroll fulliimc for a 
liitle more than S700. The 
school year ended with a 
demonstration ■ yes, a real, live 
protest regarding the, then, 
campus police chief. He 
remained the chief, for a time, 



Lighting was improved, emer- 
gency telephones have since 
been installed, but the police 
chief remained - for the 



Student government was 
active and, as a result, under 
constant attack. Picnic tables 
were purchased for students' 
use, Ihe Fort's hours of opera- 
tion were cxicnded from 4:00 
to 6;00 p.i

THE SECOND YEAR 
My Second year at IPFW, 
1989-90, was an interesting (?) 
year. The school year had not 
yet begun when the newly 
elected Student Body President 
(this writer) was embroiled in a 
public confrontation wilh Ihc 
administration over distributing '. 
eondoms to students. The 
administration said no! We said 
yes! They said they would stop 
us. Television cameras arrived, 
administrators departed and 
condoms were distribuied. 
Next, siudeni government took 
issue with a newly revised 
campus poster policy in which 
only university approved and 
sanctioned iiems could be dis- 
played on campus bulletin 
boards. The policy was protcsi- 
cd, lawsuits threatened, news 
siories wriiicn, meetings 
attended and today we have ■ 



insiatled in the student lounges, 
the Jack Ulmer student loan 
was established, the Student 
Body President appeared 
before the I.U, trustees wearing 
long hair and jeans lo deliver 
an attack on the systematic 
abolition of student rights by 
American universities, and was 
impeached but not convicted. 
He refused to resign. Liberals 
claimed a victory. Conserva- 
tives planned their next assault.

more. Oh. the facility still 
cuisis, but with its shiny floors, 
fresh paint, and polled plant, it 
is more akin to a sterile "skin- 
ner-box" than a irue student 
lounge. 

In this same first year, there 
was yet no parking garage or 
engineering building lo dis- 



much protest, many meetings, 
resolutions passed by siudeni 
government nnd the ouicome: 
students 1. adminisiraiion 2. 
Smokers and other civil liber- 
tarians lost Kctiler and Ihc 
library lounge. We saved areas 
in the union building — so far. 

Campus safety became an 
issue in this second year. 
Siudenis were outraged when 
ihe university seemed to take 
the position that safety was the 
student's responsibility and not 
the university's. Siudents 
demanded better lighting, 
emergency telephones, and a 
more "enlightened" police 
chief, among other things. 



appointed 
radical as us Editor in Chief 
(later forced to resign) and- 
bccamc an, almosi, real news- 
paper. A Women's Study 
degree was created, a professor 
resigned due to alleged sexual 
misconduct with students and 
there was nudity in a play at 
PIT. The year ended with a col- 
Icciivc sign of relief by campus 
administrators. 

THE THIRD YEAR 

1990-91 began as another 
year of controversy and sludent 
activism but ended almosi as 
quickly as it began. Once 
again, sludent government was 
in Ihe news. The newly elected 
Student Body Presidenl was 
forced to resign rather than 
face impeachment over alleged 
sexual misconducl. The former 
Siudeni Body President 
renamed to student govcmmeni 
as a senator and Chair of the 
Student Affairs Committee but 
he. and nearly all of his fellow 

were threatened with impcaeh- 
ment for such corruptions as: 
smoking in non-designated 
smoking areas, telling a fellow 
student government member to 
"gel a life," and use of the stu- 
dent purchased computer in 
the Sludent government offices 
for schoolwork. Counter 
charges were liles against siu- 
deni government for student 
rights violations. Compus 
Appeals Board agreed to hear 
charges, but ihc controversy 
ended when siudents said, "To 



hell with it," and resigned their 
offices. Student govcrnmcnl 
was not heard from again. 

The parking garage was 
opened and there was a parking 
problem. The campus Chief of 
Police, facing pressure from 
studcnis over his hiring of a 
former New Haven police offi- 
cer dismissed for sexual mis- 
conducl, resigned - finally! 
Helmkc Library lounge ("the 
lounge") died a quiet death. 
Vending machine prices and 
tuition costs increased, as- 
bestos was discovered in the 
buildings on campus (it's still 
there!), students and faculty 
were dropping like flics from 
the poor air quality in the 
Classroom Medical Building. 
The Communicaior became the 
campus good -news -paper, and 
George Bush's "kinder, gentler 
nation" became a reality at 
IPFW. 

THE NEW YEAR 

Now a new year has begun. 
Tuition costs have increased by 
unprecedented amounts. The 
Fort has increased food prices. 
You can no longer park at 
meters, in fact, there is no 
where to park. The cost of 
parking violations arc more 
than doubled. Classes are even 
more over-crowded and closed 
for enrollment cariicr ihan ever 
before. The Helmkc library has 
reduced its hours of opcraiioa 

smoking from the campus 
entirely. There are emergency 
phones that don'i work. And 
no one knows or cares who in 
liic hell the members of the stu- 
dent's govcmmeni arc. 

IN CONCLUSION . . . 

There is a lesson in all of this 
if you bothered to wade 
through ihcsc meandcrings. 
The campus is what you allow 
it 10 be. Demand nothing and 
you will be allowed nothing. In 
this election year we are hear- 
ing a greal amount of rhetoric 
about returning America to the 



I this 



:ampus I 
would suggest we should be 
concerned with returning the 
university to its studcnis and 
thereby stopping an adminis- 
iraiion which has become a 
machine Ihat bulldozes iis path 
to profit at Ihe expense of stu- 
dents and faculty.

ahve always wondered, if they were 
not hungry, then why did they buy so 
much food? It cannot be saved. It all 
goes down the garbage disposal, a 
total wasle of not only good food but 
everybody's precious money also. 
They are hurling only themselves in 
their tossing of food and their money

Speaking of trash, let me point out 
that, of the two dining rooms avail-

Don't hate me because I'm beautiful 



By Tim Schreiher 
Leisure writer 

Lci's lalk about somcihing ihat 
you probably ihink about daily, bul 
ra/ciy ponder - hair. Specifically. Ihe 
hair ihai covers the lop of your 
head. 

I think the concept of hair is faci- 
naiing. 

First of all, there arc these strands 
of dead nerveless cells growing out 
of the lop of our heads. These arc 
the very same heads Ihat we use lo 
attract members of the opposiitc 
sex, so we can male, cat dinner ai 
the labtc and play miniature golf. 

One would ihmk thai dead nerve- 
less cells growing out of the being's 
central aiiraciive appendage would 
be discouraged. "Oh, gross! You've 
got stringy dead siuH coming out of 
your head! Ick!" ll seems thai crea- 
tures as sophisticated as humans 
would want lo gel rid of such a 
thing. 

Bul do we dispose of hair as if it 
were waste? No. Somewhere along 
the line of man's evolution it 
occurred to us to accentuate ihc 
threads. "Hey, let's sylc them! Let's 
make them into lots of neat shapes! 
Yeah!" 

Now we are at the point in hair- 
siyling evolution where we are 
smothering our growths of dead 
cells with all kinds of slippery, 
sticky, and tingly chemicals. Chemi- 
cals cleverly named things like 
"sprilK." "mousse," and "gel." By 
making our clumps of dead cells 
everything from fluffy .soft lo slrar- 



chy stiff, these chemicals maJtc us 
mor physically appealing. 
HAIRY INFOMERCIALS 
Wc know this is true because of 
the numerous helpful and informa- 
tive commercials floating about. 
The nice Hair Product People like to 
keep us informed of the newest Hfur 
Product Technology, because they

Just A Theory 


You 

know 


byTimScheiber 


Ihc 



mercials I'm talking about. Some 
obno;(iously beautiful woman 
daunts her hair in front of the whole 
country and says, "Don't hate me 
because I'm beautiful." Incidentall- 
ly. if that isn't a cry for help, I don't 
know what is. 

She then points out that anyone 
can have strands of dead cells jusi 
as beautiful as her's. AH you need lo 
do is buy Chealoraugh Beauty 
Spritz (and its 14 accompanying 
products - each sold sepcrately) and 
a man you've never met before will 
suddenly buy you a car. Yes. it's thai 



incredibly easy! 

These fine dead growths sticking 
out of our heads have become so 
important in our society that bald 
men have been lured into watching 
infomercials. It's a sad state that 
enulfs our culture when once ratio- 
nal men spend whole chunks of 
their Sunday afternoon watching a 
man named Biff demonstrate the 
sapace-agcd technology of a chemi- 
cal thai, when rubbed into the user's 
scalp, actually causes the user to 
hallucinate that he is an irresistible 
stud. The user then goes out and 
offers a new car lo ihc first women 
he sees. 

So I have a theory that the Hair 
Product People and the Car People 
are in cahoots, but it's just a theory. 

PHIL TALKS HAIR 

The other day. someone told me 
abou I a talk show where the 
topic of the day was: My Bad 
Haircut Ruined My Life 

Apparently, a network ran a show, 
complete wiOi sponsors and an audi 
ence and a congenial-but-serious- 
when-need-be host, {Phil? Oprah'.' 
Sally? I didn't ask), and filled up an 
entire hour of programming talking 
about their hair tragedies. 

This gist of each hair tragedy was 
[his: An innocent person, with hair, 
hired a person posing as a profes- 
sional to cut their dead cells. What 
happened was, instead of the haircut 
making the victim look more 
appealing, il made him or her look 
less appealing. 

The victims felt understandably 



outraged, and were suing the mali- 
cious, evil and less-lhan-slime char- 
latans who had mangled iheir 
threads of dead cells. Bul you know, 
you really can't put a price on that 
kind of Pain and Suffering. 

You have to consider that Ihe vic- 
tim's wardrobe was probably 
ruined, as well as their marriage 
(who could be married coAomeome 
with a bad haircut?), their career 
and iheir credit rating. 

So the victims, after consulting 
their lawyers, decided on a nice 
even round number, like say SlOO 
million. 

Maybe the publicity of this hor- 
rendous event will send a stern 
warning to our professional dead 
cell cutlers. Our strands of nerveless 
dead cells arc not to be handled fiip- 
pantly! And we will noi take Hair 
Abuse! 

I think it's a step in the right direc- 
tion, although I'm a Hide concerned 
about what this will do to the cost of 
future hair care. What if malpractice 
insurance for the hair cutlers sky- 
rockets like that of physicians? I 
shudder lo think of a simple haircut 
costing as much as a CAT scan. 

These arc jusi a few of my 
thoughts on hair. I have to go now 
and look m a mirror. I ihink 1 fell 
one of my strands of dead cells 
move out of place. 1 just hope no 
females nouced iL

Revivalists determined to liberate literature 



Pages 



By Miiry Shrock 
Fealures Editor 

A liio of liicrary devotees have 
begun a society dedicated to resur- 
recting lilcraiurc, pociry and film on 
the IPFW campus. 

Literary Revival Society co- 
founder Amy Faurote said that 
another goal may be, "Defacing 
Tennyson as much as possible." 

Sisters Amy and Sarah Fauroic. 
boih seniors at 
IPFW. and Laura 
Swartz. a recent 
IPFW graduate, 
decided to create 
an outlet for peo- 
ple interested in 
sharing ideas 
about pociry. 
movies and 

books. 

"We needed a 
forum for people 
who enjoy liter- 
ary and artistic expression. It's not a 
writers group," said Swariz. 

These women, with the help of the 
Center for Women and Returning 
Adulls, began the Literary Revival 
Society. 

"Our main goal is to get people 
involved who you wouldn't think to 
include in a literary group. It's not 
just for composition majors. It's the 
whole community. Wc want factory 
workers, waitresses, and accoun- 
lanis." Slud Amy Fauiotc. 

The three women decided the 
group was a necessary and missing 
element in the community. 

"We all kind of came to die conclu- 
sion to do this logeiher because lit-

erature is dead," said Faurote. 

Linda Johnson, director for the 
Center for Women and Returning 
Adulls. the sponsors of the program, 
said. "We wanted a program that 
would be meaningful to the lives of 
our students. It's part of our on- 
going mission to bring our students 
together." 

Both Faurote sisters major in 
English. Sarah specializes in 
American litera- 
ture and Amy is 
unresolved as to 
which genre she 
will specialize in. 
Swaru graduat- 
ed widi her bach- 
elor's degree in 
Irish studies and 
plans to go on to 
University 
College Dublin in 
a graduate pro- 
gram. 

"We're just learning what we can 
do with this group. We want to 
include evcrydiing. Just because it's 
a literary revival doesn't mean it 
cancels out an," said Fauroic. 

All three agree that they will strive 
to continue the organization beyond 
die boundaries of IPFW and the Fori 
Wayne community. 

"We're gonna take it widi us and 
open up chapters wherever wc go." 
said Faurote. 

On Thursday. Sept. 24. the 
Literary Revival Society will hold 
its next meeting by the student gov- 
ernment lounge on the second Hoor 
of Walb Memorial Union.

What's in a name? For IPF\V aih-

The IPFW Aihictic Center, also 
known as ihc Multi-Purposc 
Building, will be renamed ihc 
HJDiard Gates Sports Center as pan 
of a campaign to raise SI. 5 million 
foraUiIctic scholarships. 

The Oct. 11 renaming ceremony 
will honor Hilliard Gates, z broad- 
caster who ha.s been involved with 
local sports for many years on both 
Ihc professional and amateur level.

Spotlight 

Gales has also been immonali/.cd 
for many basketball fans through his 
pan in ihc movie "Hoosiers". In the 
nim, Gales poniays himself in the 
familiar role of a radio sports 
announcer. 

Gates is also a big supporter of 
Komei hockey. He has helped nur- 
ture the franchise through many los- 
ing seasons and neur empty rinks. 

"Hilliard has been a supporter of 
our program throughout Ihc years, 
and worked with young people 
though sports tor a long time." 
Amie Ball, IPFW athletic director, 
said. 

Nearly SI, 2 million of the Sl.S 
goal has been pledged all ready 
though the efforts of the Athletic 
Scholarship Fund Campaign. 
according to Ball. 

"Wc are very pleased with the 
results thus far," Ball said. 

Corporations, foundations, trusts, 
community groups and Alumni have 
been the source of the funds that are 
scheduled to be honored over the 
next five years. 

The Foellinger Foundation has

these pledges, according to Dave 
Skelton. who works in development 
at IPFW and served as athletic 
director here from 1977-1087. 

During his tenure as adileiic direc- 
tor. Skelton oversaw the construc- 
tion of the Athletic Center in 1981. 

Skelton noted that the Foellinger 
Foundation played a big part in the 
fund raising campaign right from the 
slarL 

"A couple of years ago the founda- 
tion made a sizeable grant to keep 
IPFW athletics going. And this 
allowed the campaign to get 
planned, organized and started," 
Skelton said, "The program would 
have been curtailed without them," 

The scholarship fund looks to be a 
solution to the problem of under- 
funding that has plagued IPFW ath- 
letics in die past 

An endowment fund, made up of 
the monies brought in through this 
campaign, will be set up and admin- 
istered through Purdue Uni%
