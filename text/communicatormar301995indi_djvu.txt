The Southwesi Allen County School 
Sysicm suspended IPFW baseball coach 
Thomas Muth from leaching ai Homestead 
High School, where he taught for 16 years. 
In ihosc sixteen years. Muth said he only 
missed "approximaiely 15 loial days." 

SACS Assisiant Superintendent Toni 
Kring issued no ofHcial word, and colled the 
suspension a personnel mailer in wtiicb Mulh 
deserves con fide nijality. 

Mulh said be Teels his Ireatmcni from the 
SACS adminLstraiion has been unjusL Muth 
said be was suspended for traveling with the 
IPFW baseball leam during Spring Break 
while SACS had class and for traveling with 
Uie leam during school hours on Wednesday, 
March 22 for a game with Goshen College. 



'"I orficially requested this time off, bul the 
supcrinienilcni slopped my request before it 
ever came lo Ihc school board." Muth said. 

Muth said usually all requests for leaves 
are reviewed by the school board. The SACS 
office confirmed that unpaid leaves are "usu- 
ally requested through the school board." 
According lo Muth, the board has let other 
teachers lake unpaid leaves of absence for 
vacations and Muih said he felt that coaching 
should be considered equal lo vacations. 

"[ hope the board will reinstate me but 
they do have legal grounds to fire me," Mulh 
said. Mulh does nol deny he was insubordi- 
nate and vowed not to fight the board when 
they meet to discuss Muth's suspension and 
insubordination on April 28. 

"We hoped the relationship between 
Homestead and us would be a good one, bul 
it hasn't turned out that way." said Butch 



Perchan, IPFW athletic director. Perchan also 
said he knew of other colleges where coach- 
es have been teachers at the high school level 
and the relationships have been good. 

Muth's suspension incited a protest at 
Homestead High School which lasted for two 
days. Students staged a sil-in which slancd 
during the last class period on Thursday. 
March 23 and carried over lo Friday. 
Thursday's protest was cut short when a stu- 
dent pulled a fire alarm, Kring said, 

Muth said a few studenls had a legitimate 
reason to protest on Thursday bul he added 
Friday's "mob scene was uncalled for." 

"The students did noi use good judgment; 
they could have expressed their feelings in a 
better way," Muth said. He said he offered lo 
come 10 Homestead on Friday morning and 
attempt to alleviate the situation with an 
announcement over the PA. 



Most of those students hiive been sus- 
pended for "disruptive behavior" and "will- 
ful disobedience," according lo Kring. She 
said, "We're disappointed by the way the stu- 
denls expressed Iheir feelings but tJicy were 
warned that actions like the one taken would 
result in consequences." 

Homestead Junior Meg McKibben said. 
"The adminisuation never asks for student 
opinions." She also implied that the adminis- 
tration does nol care aboul what is best for 
the sludenLs. 

Other Homestead students' feelings were 
mixed. "I think be deserves what he got; they 
told him nol lo do iC said one male student.

taken a sabbatical and is out of the country.

Department head appointed 



By MelKsa Young-FIores 
Chief Reporter 

This month. J. Elaine Blakemorc was selected by 
peers and appointed by Dean of 
the School of Arts and Sciences 
David Cox to succeed Dennis 
Cannon as chair of the psycholo- 
gy dcpartmcni. 

Cox said he based 
Blakcmore's appointment on her 
pecr&amp;' recommendation and her 
skills as a teacher and adminis- 
trator. "She is a very good 
teacher. She has served on vari- 
ous important administrative 
committees. She is a fine scholar," said Cox. 

According to Cox. Blakemore's new position will 
not need much modification. If Cannon was nol retir- 
ing, the department would not need a new chair, 
Blakemore said. 

Blakemorc agreed with Cox that the depanmenl 
was in good working order. "1 think that this depan- 
menl is an absolutely outstanding work environment. I 
have no intcniion of changing very much," she said. 

According lo Blakemore, the department is a 




Blakemore 



model. "People here are very decent lo each other and 
while there are disagreements sometimes, it is very 
rare thai there is any hostility or personal attacks, and 
one of my most imporiani goals is for it to remain thai 
way," she said. "I think we have excellent teachers. 
and 1 cannot imagine that any of that is going to 
change." 

The benefits the department offers students arc pan 
of what makes the department great, according to 
Blakemore. "I think in this department we do a lot of 
good things for students. We are very involved in 
advising our majors" Blakemore said. "We provide 
an annual program to provide information on how to 
get into graduate school." 

Blakemore's goals for ihe department do not veer 
much from the cunent administrative siyle. "I have no 
intention of changing very much. I want the depan- 
menl lo run as a well-functioning democracy." 
Blakemore said. "1 expect Ihe faculty to continue to 
have autonomy, bul to be responsible contributors to 
the department and Ihe university." 

"From my perspective. Ihe role of a chair is 
twofold. The most imporiani Igoal] is lo create an 
environment that is good for people to work in, and 
the second is to do the adminislraiive tasks efficient- 
ly," said Blakemore.

lU alumnus runs for trustee 



By Melissa Young-Flores 
Chief Reporter 

Each year, lU alumni are given die opponuni- 
ty lo cleci one member lo lU's board of trustees. 
Presently there arc nine 
board seats, three of which 
are filled on a rotating 
basis by members elected 
by lU alumni. 

This year. Fort 
Wayne resident and lU 
alumnus Larry Lee has 
decided to run for the seat. 
The official list of his 
opponents has not yei been 
released. 

"If elected, he will be the first person from 
Northeast Indiana to be elected in several years, 
although others from the area have been appoint- 
ed," Rebecca Teagarden, lU alumnus and a par- 
ticipant in IPFW events said. "Larry has shown 
generous fmancial support of IPFW, and he has a 
goal to make the campus an even more vital 




Lee 



force In our community and in the staie-wide 
system." 

"Id June, all lU alurrmi will vote for a candi- 
date for Ihe annual open alumnus seat on lU's 
board of trustees," said Teagarden, "Alumni 
elect three of the university's nine unjsiees, and 
each alumni trustee serves a three year term." 

Lee has served on the IPFW Scholarship 
Campaign, the IPFW foundations, and as presi- 
deni of the IPFW Athletic Club, Lee has also 
been awarded the Broyles Award for his service 
10 IPFW. 

"My entire adull hfe has been a labor of love 
of doing everything I can to contribute to and 
suppon Indiana Universiiy," Lee said. "The four 
years I spent at Bloomington were the best four 
years of my life." 

Lee says if elected, making die regional cam- 
puses more accessible, especially lo non-iradi- 
lional and underre presented students, will be one 
of his major goals. 

"I think the issue of affordabilily and accessi- 
bility of an Indiana education, and higher educa- 
tion in general, is a very pressing Issue." Lee 



Diversity council defines itself; moves toward future 



said. "The regional campuses provide die logis- 
tics and access, especially to the non-tradilional 
and undcrrepresented potential students." 

Lee said he will also see former Indiana 
Universiiy president Thomas Erlich's dream of 
"one university with eight front doors' continued, 
as well as encourage current lU President Mites 
Brand's 'America's new public imiversJiy' drive. 

"I would like lo. along with Bloomington, 
culiivale and nurture the potential growth of 
IPFW and die regional campus." I-ec said. 

"Lany is a strong advocate and supponer of 
the regional campuses, in particular IPFW. He 
sees each of die lU system's regional campuses 
as 'an urban college reflecting the needs and the 
strengths of its respective home community,'" 
Teagarden said, 'Typically, only eight percent of 
the eligible lU graduates actually vote. So. a 
strong show of support for Larry just in our local 
area communities could aciually determine the 
election." 

The actual campaign has nol yet begun.but 
ballots will be mailed lo all lU degree holders 
beginning in May.

In a November 14 memorandum lo all fac- 
ulty and staff. Chancellor Michael Wanell 
issued a campus siaiemeni on diversity and 
CTcaied a campus Diversity Council. 

In his written address. Wanell said the uni- 
vcreiiy had a moral obligaiion lo provide ade- 
quale leadership dirough di\-ersiry to the cam- 
pus community. 

"In our elTorts lo prepare IPFW's studenls 
for produairt, fulfilling lives, we must eiuble 
tbem to understand and work effectively both 
with the diverse groups who compose our own 
nation and widi the even more diverse groups 
of ibe global community." Wanell said. 



Wanell said it is the moral responsibility of 
the university lo recogni2e the imponance of 
diversity. 

According to Vice Chancellor of Student 
Aff^rs and co-chair of die Diversity Council 
Frank Borelli, die council was created after 
four faculty and administraiive members took 
a week-long trip lo the AAC&amp;U Diversity 
Insiiiuie in the nation's capital. 

The diversity leam developed ten initiatives 
for IPFW. Their firsi objecii\'e was to deter- 
mine administrative responsibility for develop- 
ing and implementing campus diversity goals. 

As a result of diis objeciive die Diversity 
Council was created. Tlie new council dien 
decided to adopt die team's goals. 

The council has mei twice since its forma- 



tion 10 work on defining divenity. the second 
initiative. 

A preliminary definiuon was established by 
die group ai dieir March 2 meeting. According 
10 the Diversity Council minuies, the council 
determined thai "diversity encompasses a 
range of differences including ethnicity, race, 
color, gender, sexual orientation, age, and dis- 
abilities, as well as political, religious, and 
class differences.'" 

"We c^ne up widi die definition of diversi- 
ty dial we warn lo use on this campus," said 
Jeaneite Oausen, Dirersity Council member. 

file members look diis definition back lo 
their sub-councUs for discussion. Oausen said 
her group questioned die political a^tect of the 
definiijoa. ""We wanted to look at ail kinds of 



differences that cause division among people," 
Clausen said. 

Vice Chancellor of Academic Affairs Fred 
Kirchhoff said the group has noi yet addressed 
the third Iniiiaiive of a consensual campus 
work plan. 

According lo Kirchhoff. the working plan 
could include several elements. Some of the 
possibilities he mentioned were diversity 
enrichment in courses and recruiting more 
minority students and faculty. However, 
Kirchhoff stated the working plan cannot tack- 
le everydiing. "^e have to decide which ones 
are most impon2nt,''he said.

u, and out tie ok 



In a few weeks the slate budget 
will be decided and it is up to peo- 
ple like you and me to help sway 
legislators to vote for more money 
for Indiana schools. And yes. that 
means IPFW, loo. 

"The past few years, university 
funding has been severely neglect- 
ed," commented Berry. This is quite 
obvious here at IPFW when one 
glances at die parking problem, the 



absence of Internet and die lack of 
buildings and facilities. And to top 
thai off. tuition is still increasing. 

The purpose of Hoosiers for 
Higher Education is lo gel public 
support, especially from you, the 
student. Without actual support, the 
possibility of gelling extra money 
to build new buildings, keep luilion 
costs down and maybe add a park- 
ing lot or iwo at IPFW will be diffi- 



cult. 

All thai is really needed to 
obtain estra money is a simple let- 
ter and/or phone call to your siaie 
legislaior. 

"It takes a surprisingly small 
amount of effort to have rippling 
effects in Indiana Congress," 
explained Berry. Basically, if area 
legislators received 15 letters or so, 
they would take a closer look lo the 



obvious need for money to go to 
staieschools. i.e. IPFW. 

If you are interested in being a 
pan of Hoosiers for Higher 
Education and would like to 
call/write your representative or 
would tike more information, 
please contact Kara Whiting at The 
Communicator at 481-6584 or stop

The Silver Screen Review: 
'Dolcres Claiborne' 



By Kar^ Whitini; 
Features Editor 

Alrighty then, Kalhy Bates is 
at it again in Steven King's latest 
thriller, "Dolores Claiborne." 
After the hit "Misery," 1 was 
expecting more fright and gore 
from the master himself, but to 
my surprise, this was not the case 
in "Dolores Claiborne." 



Instead, the story of Dolores 
Claiborne is about a woman, her 
daughter and the dark secrets of 
their family. Even though some 
of the scenes are frightening, the 
movie does not revolve around 
fright and the usual Steven King 
idiosycrincics. 

The movie takes a deep psy- 
chological look into the life of a 
New England family and twists 



die truth and keeps the viewer in 
suspense. But the whole truth is 
revealed piece by piece and Ihe 
story never totally climaxes, 
which disappointed diis viewer. 

The accents which are used 
are quite interesting. Kathy Bates 
obviously worked very hard to 
sound like a New Englandcr, but 
if it is really an authentic accent. 
I can not decide because I have 



never lived on the East Coast. 

Overall the movie was slow. 
The plot moved very lethargical- 
ly and the movie was not worth 
the $5.50 my date paid for, I can 
only give this Steven King 
"thriller" (even Michael 
Jackson's video 'Thriller" was 
more scary than this flick) two 
junior mints out of a possible 
four.

French Is spoken here. 

Or at least it was at the 
French Poetry contest 
Tuesday night sponsored by 
the Cercle Francais. Over 
thirty students recited poems 
ipFr^nCli. ip&gt; \yaH) Union,; 
R6om''224''td''^6[tiptte for four 
prizes in each of three cate- ' 
gories. 

Gabrielle Hapner won first 
prize in the first-year catego- 
ry with her recitation of "Le 
Pont Mirabeau." by 

Apollinaire. 

Adam McCray took first 
prize in the second-year cate- 
gory for a humorous rendition 
of "Le Corbeau et Le Renard," 
by Jean de La Fontaine. 

First prize in the Third and 
Fourth-year category went to 
Seana lane for "La pluie et les 
tyrans," by Supervielle. 

All prizes were donated by 



Le Cercle Francais and the 
department of modern foreign 
languages. 

Nancy Virtue, professor of 
foreign language and faculty 
adviser to Cercle Francais, 
said she thought the contest 
was great. 

"I am really proud of all my 
students," Virtue said,

to campii^ diversity," aUdet^ l"

Shawn Stanley, president of 
the Cercle Francais, said one 
the Cercle Francais's main 
concerns is culture. "We try 
and make up for the culture 
lacking in the first and sec- 
ond-year classes," she said. 

Last year, the club spon- 
sored a French film series 
and this year, members have 
held several fund raisers to 
finance a summer trip to

The Fort Wayne Ballet: 
'Cinderella' 



By Kara Whltrng 
Features Editor 

This lasi weekend was (he Fori 
Wayne Ballet's performance of 
"Cinderella." Remarkably enough, 
Ihc performance was awesome 
under ihe current circumstances. 
Those circumstances being the 
recent change in the position of 
artistic director; this change has 
caused some turmoil for the Fori 
Wayne Ballet. 

But, hey. I did not go to see the 
ballet on Saturday to be reminded of 
the situation; no, I went because 
"Cinderella" is a great fairy tale and, 
under the artistic direction of 
Michael Tevlin and Robert Kelley. 
this story really came alive. 

The story of Cinderella was told 
through motion and music, a combi- 
nation of beautiful work that all of 



the performers should be proud of, 
especially Judy Jacob Tevlin, who 
played the role of Cinderella. 

But. despite the wonderful dis- 
play of talented dancers of all ages, 
die characters which really siole the 
show were Cinderella's sisters. 
Skinny and Dumpy, who were 
played by Gary Lanier and Brian 
Wagner, yes, men playing women. 
Needless to say, it was quite humor- L_ 
ous. The humor in this ballet was 
immense and for the first time. I 
laughed during a performance. And 
I do not mean a mere chuckle, no, f 
mean I laughed out loud. 

This particular ballet was one of 
the best I have ever seen performed 
by the Fort Wayne Ballet, and I 
commend the performers on a job 
well done! And for a rating, I give 
"Cinderella" four ballet slippers out 
of four.

IPFW students explore a 
different kind of spring break 



While some of you wae basking 
in the sun, or diowning in Ihe rain, 
some IPFW siudcnla decided lo try 
somclhing a little different. 

Seven IPFW siudenls. of all dif- 
fercnl ages and backgrounds, set off 
on March 4 lo Cherokee, N.C. for a 
week of unforgellable experiences 
with Native Antcricans. 

The group trip was presented by 
the IPFW Campus Ministry and 
Campus Ministry leaders Sr, 
Marybclh Martin and Cheryl Peterson 
went along for Ihc ride. 

Peterson really enjoyed the trip 
Iwcause it was an amazing learning 



exper 






n learn s 
sbye 



this trip lo anyone. 

"1 think V 
more about oursch 
ourselves in another culture." 
mented Peterson. 

But Peterson was not Ihe only one 
who realized Ihat this trip was really a 
great experience, 



IPFW student Mark Fisher said 
that it was interesting to chat with the 
Native Americans and would also 
encourage friends and family to go on 
a trip like this. 'This was a very good 
experience for one to do," Fisher 
commented. 

Another IPFW student. Jcanelte 
Brooks, commented that she liked the 
Uip and found it lo be a real learning 
experience. 

Jeremy Kaylor, another IPFW siu- 
deni who went on this irip, said he 
enjoyed die trip very much and plans 
to go agaia 

Much of the trip was work; work- 
ing construction, working in the 
abused children's shelter, etc. But 
despile the hard work, the gratiTica- 
lion of helping and givuig something 
back to a community is far greater 
than many other activities which most 
people partake during spring break.

SACS undemocratic 



Rcccnily, Thomas Mulh. a 
teacher ai Homcsicad High School, 
was suspended wllh pay due lo 
fnsubordlnadon. In addition lo 
being a (cacher al Homestead High 
School, he is the baseball coach ai 
IPFW. 

Mulh submiiicd a request to the 

school admlnislratton for 10 lo 12 

n on -consecutive days off to attend 

IPFW baseball events. These days 

off would have been unpaid. 

';i-^ According lo icachers ai 

&lt;i. , Homestead high school requests 

,,, such as Mulh's arc normally 

, , reviewed by die school board. In 

.,, mis case the school board was noi 

cODSuUcd. The principal of 

Homestead High School and ihe 

supcrlnlcndcni of Southwest Allen 

Counly Schools joinUy decided not 

[0 honor Muth's request. 

■ " Alihough ihe administrators 

Involved did not explain why ihcy 

'!&lt;1 decided as they did, we would 

'" assume that they did so because 

I' II Ihey had the besi interests of the 

I --' students In mind. 

If Mulh was gone several days, 

he would need to be replaced by a 

substitute. 

„, Since Mulh was suspended, his 

I ,, classes have been taught by a sub- 

.... sUlute. 

This seems coniradiciory. If the 
administrators really had the best 
interests of the students in mind, 
why didn't Ihcy tel Mulh continue 
leaching until his hearing? 

Currently the superintendent of 
' Souihwcsl Allen Counly Schools Is 
' on sabbatical in Souih Korea for 
' five weeks. 

If the supcriniendenl was so con- 
cerned about Muth missing a few 
days of class, why did he leave ihe 
country on sabbatical for five 
weeks? 

Ii seems there is a double stan- 
dard here. If there is a policy con- 
cerning leave, the policy should 
apply 10 all employees equally. 

Mulh was forced to decide 

between his position as baseball 

coach and his position as a teacher. 

Any adminisualor wfjo w,onId put a 

'"" teacher In thai kind o'^ situation 



Commentary 



probably has other motives. 

Muth has been teaching at 
Homestead High School for more 
than 15 years, During his tenure, he 
has missed less than 15 days of 
school for any reason. 

Teachers often work second jobs 
in order to supplement their 
salaries. In fact, other universities 
have similar arrangements with 
high school teachers working as 
athletic coaches. 

Although Ihe adminisiradon may 
not have been right to deny Mulh 
the leave he requested. Muih was 
not right to disobey their orders. He 
is sdll an employee, and should do 
as his employers request. 

Not only did Uic administration 
treat Mulh unfairly, diey treated the 
smdents who protested Muth's sus- 
pension unfairly as well. 

Normally the First Amendment 
protects a citizen's right to protest. 
In the pasl this right has been cur- 
tailed in situations regarding educa- 
tional sellings so that order can be 
kept. On Thursday the protest was 
calm, and not unruly. The students 
who walked out of class were 
expressing their First Amendment 
right to free speech. They knew 
they would be punished and were 
willing to accept the consequences. 

The administration decided lo 
suspend students for three days 
instead of the normal one because 
of their decision to protest. 

First, the administration ignored 
due process by not taking Muth's 
request to the school board. Then 
Uicy ignored the students' rights by 
punishing them for protesting in 
addition to breaking school rules. 

How can we, as citizens of this 
country, expect our students to 
grow up t&gt;elieving in the democratic 
process when what they see hap- 
pening in school completely ignores 
the ideals of a democratic govern- 
ment? 

Perhaps the administrators and 
the students involved in the situa- 
tion at Homestead High School will 
consider what their actions say 
,aboni,ihi;mselves aud, their beliefs 
before diey act again

Letters to the Editor 



Judicial hearing attacks person not issue 



Letter to the Editor: 

I recently came before the Judicial Branch of IPSGA to argue my 
case concerning the Technology Fee Referendum that some of the 
students knew about. During arguments. President Mark King and 
Communications Director Jerry Richardson presented the coun with 
a book of their argumenLs, Contained within this book were personal 
attacks on me in which they said that 1 was only arguing this case for 
my own personal interests and that I was trying to derail the democ- 
ratic system for my own self interests. Boys, for I know you not as 
Men of Iniegrity, gel some sense will you. Ever since 1 filed my case 
I have been personally attacked, called a trouble maker who does not 
go with the program and was maliciously called a "fool" during 
President King's address in a Senate meeting. 

Since both of you are Political Science majors, 1 see that you have 
not learned what the demoCTalic system is all about. It is voices like 



mine that make the check and balance system work. If voices like 
mine are stifled and attacked then dictatorships form with no oppor- 
tunity for free voices to be heard (such as the one that has been Irying 
lo form under the guidance of you two.) 

I can see the two of you had lo resort to baseless lies and innuendo 
about my character. Within mc you have found opposition to your 
dictatorial ways, I am very grateful that your terms are quickly com- 
ing to an end. The moment thai you leave this student government is 
the exact moment dial this government will again carry on the job 
Ihat it is meant to do, Adios and farewell and may the politics of the 
real world treat you as unfairly as you have treated your constituenU 
here. 

Contemptuously.

AIDS real risk at IPFW 



' AIDS - it's that disease no one 
wants to talk about, yet it's killing 
us, and if we don't change our ways 
we won't be alive to talk about it 
tomorrow. 

AIDS is no longer a gay disease, 
nor Is It a disease apparent only 
among drug 
users and pros- 




Meean ^^cco^-ng lo "le 

McArdle ures from the 

Center for 
Disease Control AIDS Is the num- 
ber one cause of death for all 
Americans ages 25-44. That means 
you. You are more likely to die of 
AIDS than you are of a heart attack, 
a car accident or anything else for 
that matter. 

U you have ever had sex you 
could have AIDS. If you tell me you 
don't want to hear that because it 
scares you I will say, "Good. It 
should." 

The only way to be sure you 
won't get AIDS is to not have sex. 
If you arc going to have sex the 
only way to protect yourself is lo 
use a condom with a spennicide that 
kills the AIDS virus, but even this is 
notpC[\:entcfrecti\-e. 



Even if you do use a condom you 
should talk to your partner before 
you have sex and discuss your 
respective sexual histories. If nei- 
ther of you have had sex before then 
there is little risk. If either person 
has had sex. especially if they have 
had unprotected sex, then thai per- 
son should get tested for HIV. 

Even though a person has been 
exposed to the AIDS virus they will 
not test HIV positive immediately 
and may not test positive for three 
lo six months. Therefore, it is 
imperative that tell your pariner if 
you've ever had sex without a con- 
dom, and that they are open with 
you. If you aren't, you could be 
signing away the rest of your life. 

No matter how well you know 
someone, if you are unsure you 
should use a condom. 

Yet a recent survey of Americans 
shows ihat people in monogamous 
relationships are three times less 
likely to use condoms than those 
who have had many recent sex part- 
ners. 

If these people are not using a 
condom and they are not sure about 
their pariners' sexual histories then 
they could be exposing themselves 
lo the AIDS virus. 

When it comes right down to it, 
is a few minutes of ecstasy worth 
your entire life?

and once again I am hard pressed to find a reason for his writing it, 
Granied, there are a lot of pig- beaded homophobes in the world, but no 
matter what Paul Tupper hopes to accomplish by is writings, this will 
never change. I fear that if Paul Tupper continues with these poorly written 
and juvenile topics he will only serve lo make the rift between homo- and 
heterosexuals wider. 

Mr. Tupper is not only insulting with his use of the derogatory term 
"breeders", he is also, in his own way, pig-headed and close-minded, HLs 
articles suggest thai all heterosexuals are homophobes, and that all people 
who don't congratulate him for his homosexuality are sexually repressed 
or insecure. This view only brings about animosity, or misunderstanding. 

As a heterosexual, 1 cannot say that 1 completely understand homosexu- 
ality, but as a mulauo, I do understand prejudice. Mr. Tupper is setting 
himself up to be discriminated against by both heterosexuals and homosex- 
uals — and not for the greater good of all homosexuals. Homosexuals seek 
emotional, spiritual, and sexual relationshipsjust like heterosexuals do, but 
with their same sex. They are concerned about controversial topics such as 
AIDS, gays in the military, and yes, even abortion and politics. They are 
not Ihe sexual deviants that homophobes would like to believe, they are not 
out to molest your children, or rape you. They live their lives just like any- 
one else and do not deserve to be singled out in ierm.s of "Us" and "Them", 
Unfonunatcly, Mr. Tupper misses this point altogether. His articles are no 



longer slightly tedious, they're down right annoying, and he scLs himself 
up not for praise, bul for ridicule. His topics come right out of Seventeen 
magazine. No one, including most other homosexuals, is interested in 
"How lo Put Romance into a Relationship", or Paul Tupper's roommate 
troubles, 1 can assure you also, Mr, Tupper, no one is the slightest bit inter- 
ested in who you've had sex with, how you had sex with them, and espe- 
cially whether you view yourself as a man or a woman. People, homo- and 
heterosexuals, want to hear a frank discussion of the issues, and a little less 
editoriali7,ing. The aim of die article should be towards die gay community, 
and it should be a tool to bring people togedier, not a way of slandering the 
people who don't agree with you. You should be bigger than that. 

Since Mr. Tupper only wants to talk about his sexual escapades, he per- 
petuates the image of gays as sexual deviants. I have heard more that one 
homosexual suggest that Mr, Tupper is only gay for the trotoriety that It 
brings him, I suggest that Mr. Tupper stand back and take a good long lo(* 
at the image thai he is presenting, and he will sec diat he is doing the gay 
community a great disservice, 

I understand Uiat my writing this leuer will not provoke Mr. Tupper to 
discontinue his edhorial. In fact, I suspect that il will only serve to encour- 
age him to continue writing more of this juvenile drivel. I hope, as do 
much of the student body, that he will not continue writing this article.

Diversity Council inactive at best

Diversity has been an issue in 
this nation ever since the fu^t pil- 
grims settled on the Native 
Americans' land. Over the cen- 
turies, people from every ethnic and 
racial background have chosen or 
been forced to make America their 
home. 

Due to this simple reality, we are

faced with the fact that if we are to 
ever live in any amount of harmo- 
ny, we need to at least understand 
the different 
cultures, reli- 
gions, and tra- 
ditions of our 
fellow inhabi- 
tants. 

This fact 
is not as easy to 
swallow for 
many as it is 
for them to say. 
Often this 

important and 

crucial cold 
truth is used to win an election or 
pacify a student body widi hole or 
no results after the election has 
been won or the crowd has been 
muffled. 

Such a pacification, however 
subde, has seemed to slither its way 
onto our campus as well. 

On November 14 of last year. 
Chancellor Wartell established the 
campus Diversity Council. This 
council should, in theory, be edu- 
cating the students and f^^nilty thor- 
oughly, recniiiing minority faculty 



and administralion, and seeing that 
our curriculum represents America 
as it is and die true spirit of how our 
nation was created, not the glossy 
version many of our forefathers 
would like us to be told. 

Great, now I'll see some results. 
Perhaps I'll see more faces that are 
a different color than my own when 
I enter my classes. Right? Now that 
we have a diversity watchdog and 
educator, there will be some effect 
on the 1 1 ,(X)0 or so of us walking 
around here. Right? 

I'm still waiting for my culture 
shock. How about you? 

Since the council was created, 
four months and sixteen days have 
passed us. So far the council has a 
working definition of diversity and 
has held two workshops. 

This covers two of the initiatives 
the council has adopted. What 
about the other eight? The school 
year is ticking away, but what mark 
wiU the council have actually made 
when the class of '95 is wearing 
their caps and gowns? 

Where are our protnised results? 

According to the minutes of their 
seoHid meeting, the council met for 



one hour. Perhaps that would have 
been sufficient if the group had met 
more than twice in four months and 
sixteen days, but they haven't. 

I can apreciate that the memben 
give of their time to even have a 
council. However, the majority of 
the people on the council are facul* 
ty and admtnstrative members. 
Therefore, they are already are 
being paid for their time by our 
tuition and student fees. 

As employees of this imivcrsiiy 
they should aheady be ensuring thai 
we have adequate representation of 
minority faculty, multicultural 
activities, and a curriculum that 
teaches many points of view. 

It is not as if they are trying to 
decide whether or not to purchase a 
copy machine or a coffee maker. 

Diversity is an essential pan of 
our education and personal growth. 
As long as this campus lacks diver- 
sity, we are being cheated and 
deserve a significant amount of oar 
money back.

Letters to the Editor 



Friendship ends because of dishonesty 



To Ihe Edilor 

Please allow me (o introduce 
myself, my name is 'Sian'. My 
siory, or rather my dilemma was 
made public last week in Paul 
Tuppet's column "Homosexually 
Speaking". Normally. I have nothing 
against Paul or his aiticlc until I read 
it last week. I can assure you thai ii 
was clearly myself thai Tuppcr was 
wriiing alxiut in his column. Smce il 
was quite against my will (without 
my knowledge or consultation) that 
Tuppcr presented the Tacis". there 
existed blatant erroneous statements 
which I would like to clarify. Please 
allow me to do so. 

Tupper asserted thai I am a bigot 
and also homophonic. 

Not true — The reason why I dis- 



continued my friendship with Jeff 
was not because of his sexual prefer- 
ence, but merely because he had lied 
to me. Because I choose my friends 
based on loyalty and trust wonhiness, 
I was able to see ihrough Jeffs char- 
acter and discontinue the relation- 
ship. In this instance homosexuality 
was not even an issue. 

Tupper points out that I spread 
rumors about Jeff hitting on me to 
further isolate myself from Jeffs 
■ lifestyle* - 

Not true — Before Jeff "came out 
of the closet I had serious questions 
about Jeffs sexual preference. It 
became evident that Jeff was not 
being 'friendly' in the small remarks 
that he made etc. Nevertheless, I 
gave Jeff the benefit of the doubt 



and kepi these things to myself. 

Tupper remarks that I did not 
consider Jeffs feelings when I dis- 
continued the friendship. 

Not true — obviously. 'Jeff did 
not consider my feelings by being up 
front with me at the beginning. How 
do you suppose I felt to find out thai 
a "friend' had been misleading all 
this time? How do you suppose any 
of the girls fell that "Jeff was seeing 
at the time when he told them that he 
was gay? E&gt;o you think it was fair to 
them? Imagine this: Suppose "Jeff 
had been up front with mc at the 
beginning. If 'Jeff could have found 
it inside himself to tell me when we 
met (3 months ago) thai he was gay, 
I probably would have been fine 
with that. ]f 'Jeff had been honest, 



things would most likely ha« been 
different. We all could have learned 
to live with and respect 'Jeff for 
who he rightfully is. Unfortunately. 
this did not happen and 'JefT is suf- 
fering the consequences of his own 
actions. As for you. Paul Tupper, I 
live In a state of mutual respect with 
your weekly articles, and it is not 
my wish to try and Silence them. 
However, I am asking you to check 
your facts more clearly when you are 
concocting these articles of yours. 
Perhaps gays and heterosexuals alike 
can all learn from this lesson and be 
more honest with each other in the 
future. 

Sincerely, 

Stephen M. Plan (Stan) 



Homosexual opinions necessary at IPFW 



Letter to the Editor 

When I opened Ibe 
Communicator today the first thing 
I read was Ibe -Letter to the 
Editor" column. Il was from Larry 
Gwallncy who was knocking Ihc 
"Homosexually Speaking" column 
by Paul Tupper. 1 have to say that I 
did agrt% with a few of bis points, 
although I had planned not to. but 
the entire homophonic Ihcmc was 
very sad indeed. 

I.arry pulled statistics out of thin 
air wiih no indication at all that he 
had a source, reliable or not. If he 
could have made his points without 
the underlying fear of what he does 
not even care to undersLind, it may 
have carried more weight. Then I 
read Paul Tupper's column. He was 
just as uninformed as Larry. 



I am a member of the lesbian 
community and helped to organize 
the events al Tah-Cum-Wah 
Communily Center (spell il cor- 
rectly if you want credibility). The 
Center is hardly a hot spot for gay 
and lesbian events. Anyone can 
rem the facilities for dances, sporis 
and gatherings. 

The reason's for "Saving" Tah- 
Cum-Wah are numerous. They 
have a great Day Care Center Ihat 
is vital to the area. They make soc- 
cer available lo hundreds of kids 
who would otherwise have no 
where to play. They have softball 
leagues and basketball leagues and 
volleyball. Naturally, since at least 
10% (Mr. Gwaltney) of the popula- 
tion were put on this earth by 
whomever you worship as loving 



Ihe same sex, there are lesbians and 
gay men and their children partici- 
pating in the events at Tah-Cum- 
Wah. 

The lesbian community does 
utilize space at Tah-Cum-Wah, and 
other places, for special events, that 
are always (it's been my experi- 
ence) fund raisers. We have raised 
money for many things but primar- 
ily the Women in Need Fund and 
of late the Tah-Cum-Wah 
Community Center. It is a critical 
facility for so many people. Yet 
bbeling it as a gay/lesbian haven is 
not only not true, it makes ihc 
Center vulnerable to homophobics 
in the community. 

If Mr. Tupper did not get a per- 
sonal invitation to the day-long 
fund raising events that we orga- 



nized, maybe he is not on my A 
hst. The fact that il was publicized 
all over town, including a press 
release to the Communicator, and 
that it was a huge success tells me 
that someone heard about it. 

If you feel the need to write 
about lesbians and Tah-Cum-Wah 
again, spend a few minutes con- 
tacting them to gel your facts 
"straight". It would go a long way 
in repairing that rift between the 
sexes you arc so concerned about. 

One last detail. No one should 
think for a moment that Mr. Ttippcr 
speaks for anyone except for him- 
self. Any more than Mr. Gwalmey 
speaks for any other heterosexual 
than himself 

Cat Voors 



Tupper needed but not always right 



To the editor. 

It i^ [ime for another v pice to be, 
heard. It ^s lime for someone lo 
speak out in support of Mr. Tupper's 
Homosexually Speaking column. I 
am surprised to be the one doing it. I 
am not militant, radical, or political- 
ly active. 1 am simply a lesbian. I 
believe it is time to consider the 
opinion of a Communicator reader 
who happens to be homosexual. 

When I first joined the IPFW 
communily I was very impressed to 
see a regular column in the sludent 
paper dealing openly and favorably 
with the issue of homosexuality. I 
applaud Mr. Tupper's courage to be 
so extremely open. 1 also applaud 
the staff of the Communicator for 
allowing Mr. Tupper the opportunity 
to speak. 

It is important for the heterosexu- 
al majority to understand the pur- 
pose of the Homosexually Speaking 
column. Granted, this is only my 
opinion of the column's purpose. 
However, if you will consider for a 
moment what the column does for 
mc and presumably for other mem- 
bers of the homosexual communily. 
maybe you will see some value in it 
and agree thai it should remain a 
regular pan of die Communicaior. 



1 am a lesbian. I have been a les- 
bian all my life although 1 didp'i 
realize it until I was about 18 or 19. 1 
am semi-closeted. That means thai 
my family and friends know Ihat i 
am a lesbian but the people I work 
with do not. I remain closeted ai 
IPFW for fear of damaging my 
career. I am blessed lo have the love 
and support of my family and 
friends. Un fortunately , ihey cannot 
protect me from societal prejudice 
and so a large pan of who I am 
remains hidden from the outside 
world. Hiding behind the facade of 
hctcra&gt;^exualiiy lakes a good deal of 
energy and is painfully depressing. 
Society constanily reminds mc that I 
am not acceptable as 1 am. After a 
while it becomes hard to contradict 
Ihat message in my own head. Soon 
I begin to believe thai it's mc against 
the world. That's a very isolated and 
discouraging feeling. 

That's where Mr. Tupper comes 
in. The existence of a column such 
as Homosexually Speaking is an 
affirmation of who I am and what I 
feel. It tells me that 1 am not atone in 
this world and that there really are 
other people who feel the way I do 
and who have the same concerns. 
Tliat is one of the most important 



things that a closeted (or even semi- 
closeted) homosexual needs to 
understand. The very fact that I can- 
not allow my name to be printed 
widi this letter is why the column is 
so important and why the 
Communicaior should continue to 
run it as a regular feature. It encour- 
ages me to read Mr, Tupper's words 
and know that even though I am too 
afraid to speak, there are some 
homosexuals who are willing to 
siand up and say the things that I 

That brings me to another impor- 
tant point. Although I value the role 
Mr. Tupper plays in the homosexual 
community and the fPFW conununi- 
ty in genera], I do not always agree 
with his opinions. Just because I am 
a lesbian does not means 1 have to 
agree with the ideas of all other 
homosexuaJs. I feel he perpetuates a 
harmful stereotype of homosexuals 
by placing too much emphasis on 
sexual activities. I would prefer that 
he spend more lime discussing ideas, 
altitudes and issues of concern to the 
homosexual community. I have 3 
tendency to overlook my disagree- 
ments with him because I value the 
service he provides the community. 
This may shock people (especially 



Mr. Tupper) but I happen to agree 
with Ms. Edgar. In her letter to the 
editor of March 23 she asserts ihai 
stereotyping of the heterosexual 
communily by homosexuals is 
equally wrong as the reverse. I have 
to agree. These types of altitudes 
encourage an "us against them" 
mentality that fosters ihc hostilities 
that we should be trying to soothe. I 
do not approve of the term 'breed- 
er". It categorizes a group of people 
by one possible aspect of their lives. 
Besides, while die proper time and 
circumstances have not been right in 
my life so far, I too intend to be a 
'breeder". 

The purpose of this letter is to ask 
all of us (including Mr. Tupper) to 
consider the value and role of 
Homosexually Speaking in our com- 
munity. The affirmation it provides 
to isolated homosexuals may be die 
only source of suppori they receive. 
It allows for open dialogue of a 
taboo topic. The opportunity lo con- 
sider dissenting opinions is essential 
to a vital academic community. I 
would hate to see our community 
(homosexual and heterosexual) lose 
these things. 

Amy 



Homosexually Speaking 

Tapper responds to readers 



There have been some miscon- 
ceptions about the gay lifestyle and 
this column that I think need clear- 
ing up. therefore. I've decided to 
devote this weeks column to the 
clarification of these misconeep- 
lions. 

First of all, we like ihe sex we 
are born to. We men are men and 
like to be called men. Women like 
being women and want to be called 
women. Why would anyone think 
differently? Just because we like 
being with members of the same sex 
does not mean we want to be ihe 
other sex. 




roles "passive" and "aggressive" 
and Ihey are interchangeable. 

Third, homosexuality is not a 
disease like alcoholism. It cannot be 
cured nor should it be. It Is a state of 
being and those that chose that stale 
deserve the respect as anyone else. 

Fourth, I have never worn a tutu, 
but would suppori anyone's deci- 
sion to do so. 

Fifth, if you turned the television 
on at any given moment, you would 
see that heterosexuality is on every 
show. I cannot lum anywhere with- 
out seeing straights in front of me. I 
don't mind straight people as long 
a.s they act gay in public. I wish we 
could put all of Ihe straight people 
on an island forever, (Does this 
sound dumb to you? Me too, so 
don't say Ihe same things lo me.) 

Sixth. I write about things that 
are normal to me. If you don't think 
these things are normal, it is 
because they are not normal to 
YOU. My life is very normal. I 
study a lot. work hard, am generally 
nice 10 people and respect everyone 
who respects me. Come to me when 
you need something and I will do 
my best to get it for you. I date and 
socialize with my friends on the 
weekend. I like movies, music, art, 
and Deavis and Bullhead. If this 
sounds like you or one of your 
friends, then either they are not nor- 



mal or I am. 

Seventh. I fmd it intriguing that 
all the guys are writing in saying 
thai sex IS not the center of the rela- 
tionship. This Is true with gay rela- 
tionships, but we are able to talk 
about sex more fluently than 
straights. I am a man, remember, 
and I know how guys lalk when not 
around women, Don't harp on me 
for having the courage to lalk about 
it louder than you. 

Eighth, Ihe only reason I am able 
to write this column is because there 
is room to. All I did was show up ai 
The Communicaior office and say, 
"I want to do this." Any group or 
organization can have someone 
write. I would be thrilled to see such 
an abundance of columns submitted 
that I would have to siep aside on 
occasion. Since 1 have a lot to say. 
and none of you are begging for my 
job, I am going lo keep writing. 

Ninth, Ihe whole mission of this 
column is to spread the feeling of 
solidarity lo my gay brothers and 
sisters who don't feel as open as 1 
do. And If some heterosexuals read 
me and have more sympathy and 
understanding for gays, even better 
I don'i believe all siraighis are out 
to kill the gays of the world, but I 
do think it wilt take more of a col- 
lective effort by both communiiics 
lo understand and live with each 
odia. 

Tenth, 1 don'l use the term 
"breeder" on a day to day basis, and 
If you looked at the history of this 
column you would see that I have 
only used it once. In general, I don't 
like labels but used this one to make 
a point. For those of you who were 
offended by this term, think twice 
before you use the words fag, dyke. 
chink, or kykc. They hurt us as 
much as breeder has offended you. 

I want to go on record as saying 
that I hated writing this. I did not 
want to justify any of the things 
being said by responding, hut when 
many of you asked me to do so, I 
did. 

College is supposed to be atwut 
personal growth and evolution, I 
can honestly say Ihat writing this 
column week after week since the 
beginning of ihe summer has taught 
me more about myself than any 
other experience. Everyone should 
try it. I know it's a ride I will never 
forget.

Parking not a problem at IPFW as long as spaces empty by Gates 



I have been taking classes at 
IPFW for more than 10 months 
now, and during that lime, one sub- 
ject has 
repeatedly 
come up - 
parking. 




eoced these problems myself. 

If you 3ie wondering how I man- 
age this I will tell you. it is no big 
secret. Every day I park next to 
Gates Center. There are always 
plenty of spaces, there is liiUe traf- 
fic, and I don't have to worry about 



getting tickets. 

At first I wondered why students 
were always talking about parking, 
Uien I tried lo drive ihrough die lot 
behind the Engineering Technology 
Building. 

Let me tell you what I experi- 
enced in case you have never had 
the pleasure yourself. Cars were 
bumper lo bumper from the 
entrance on Crescent all ihc way to 
the parking lot. then once you got 
into the lot there was a constant 
stream of cars circulating, and no 
one parking. Il was horrendous, it 
took me almost 5 minutes just to get 
out of Ihe mess. I didn't even 
attempt to park. 

Once I had comfortably pulled 
into my regular parking spot I took 
a minute to assess the situation. 

From what I could figure out, 
these people were braving the mess 
I bad just escaped m order to park a 
few hundred feet closer lo their 



classroom buildings. What con- 
fused me was why. 

Normally it takes me 3 minutes 
10 walk from my parking space to 
Ihe Classroom Medical Building, 5 
minutes lo walk to Neff Hall and a 
maximum of 7 minutes lo walk to 
Keider. I had jusi spent 15 minuies 
driving around, and I hadn't even 
tried to park. 

No wonder these people com- 
plained about parking. 

What I don'l understand is why 
anyone would want to go dirou^ 
ihaL I decided to ask one of my fel- 
low siudenis. They told me they 
didn't warn to have lo walk so far. 

Hmpf. The las! time I checked 
walking was good for you. Il 
increases circulation, which increas- 
es the amount of oxygen the brain 
receives. It is also good for the 
heart and the body in general. 

I was a Utile baffled by ihe stu- 
dent's reply. I could understand 



wanting to park closer if you were 
on crutches or had some other phys- 
ical problem that made walking 
long distances difficult, but to brave 
all dial jusi to keep from having to 
walk at all. Il didn't make any 
sense. 

I decided to ask someone else. 
This person told me they parked 
closer to save time. Now that was a 
real puzzler. According to my calcu- 
lations il took 10-15 minutes lo 
park, and another 5 minuies to walk 
to class. That was definiiely more 
ihan the 5-10 minuies it took me 
lotal. 

All in all, I guess I just don't see 
where die problem is. I defmiiely do 
not think the university should 
spend any money to increase stu- 
dent parking when there is at least 
one lot next to Gates thai is almost 
always entirely empty. 

Why would students want to ask 
the administration lo spend more 



money on parking when the 
resources at the library are less than 
sufficient and the number of com- 
puter labs is minuscule? 

If students want to lobby the 
administration, aren't there more 



imponani diings than parking? You 
tell me.

their level. And then all of the sud- 
den, they sianed (o play al their 
level," said BSU coach Don 
Shonikll. 

"And when we beat them earlier 
Ibis year, Conlreras had a bad 
shoulder, and they set him about 
fourteen times. Well today, ihcy set 
him 51 limes, and he ends up hit- 
ting .314. 

The last time we didn't have to 
worry about Contreras, so we leally 
focused on Josefoski. We did a 
good job on him, but now with 
ConirerBS playing his game ... he's 
3 great player, he's probably the 
best player in the country, in my 
opinion, and Jcsefoski's very good. 
loo Those two guy.s preliy much 
beai us." ShondcU added, 

PSU thrashed BSU in the third 
game, 15-4, while holding the 
Volleycards to three-percent hitting. 

BSU dropped the hard-foughl 
final game, 15-10, and the match, 
as PSU dominated at the net with 
four more team blocks and 1 1 more 
total blocks The Nillany Lions sur- 
vived 24 serving errors while hit- 
ling 13 percent belter than Ball 
State. 

The first game, we only bad 
two blocks to their eight, and then 
tbey went two, three and otK ... and 
we went five, six and five. 1 ibink 
wc Martod to make some very good 
decisions with our block and Ivan 
[Conlreras) came up big," PSU 
coach Mark Pavlik said. 

Tl think Jason Kcpner was the 
unlung hero during thai game. He 
just passed brillianily and that's 
when our blocking sianed really 
taking root, too ... it did seem our 
Mock turned it up a lilUe bit at that 
point," Pavlik added. 

Outside hitter Ed Josefoski led 
PSU with 27 kills on a 47 percent 
kill efficiency. Ivan Conlreras 
added 24 kills white setter Jose 
Ortiz assisted 82 kills. 



The Universily of California at 
Santa Barbara rebounded from ils 
loss lo BSU the previous evenmg to 
defeat the VoUeydons three games 
to one in the tournament's last 
match for their third loss in four 
nights. 

IPFW played evenly with the 
Gauchos and led 14-13 in the Hrsi 
game, but the VoUeydons were then 
ouiscored four to one and lost 17- 
15. UCSB hit 45 percent during the 
game to IPFW's 38 percent and the 
Gauchos bad 19 digs. Outside bitter 
Ricardo Soler bad 12 kills during 
ihe game. 

'I think we were a little steadier 
after poini 10, most of the time, 
except for ihe third game." Preston 
said. "We were steadiec after 10 
points in the first, second and fourth 
games." 

The Gauchos won game two, 15- 

12. out-hitting the VoUeydons 37,5 
percent lo 27,8 percent. 

IPf^ won Ihe third game. 15- 

13. puHing out of a 12-10 hole near 
the end of the game. 

UCSB won the final, 15-11, out- 
pacing the VoUeydons down the 
stretch. The Gauchos hit for 39 per- 
cent for the game while IPFW hil 
only 17 percent 

Outside hitler Etonny Harris had 
37 kills for the Gauchos and 
Valasco Amaury and Robert Treaby 
added 19 apiece. UCSB hil 37 per- 
cent and dug 51 balls to survive 22 
service cirors for the match. Setter 
Todd Rogers had 95 assists. 

There's a couple of guys who 
have to start thinking about what 
they're doing. They just kind of go 
back and they bit it [while serving] 
. . these are the two jumpers ihat arc 
missing," Preston said. 

All-lournament selection 
Ricardo Soler bad 26 kills lo lead 
IPFW while Scott Lauer assisted 77 
kills and had a team-high nine digs. 
The VoUeydons hit 29 percent and 
had 30 fewer kills than the 
Gauchos. 

"1 thought be [Soler] was really 
good early, not very good in the 
middle, and really good at the end. 1 
had to have a talk with him because 
he got real flat, he got emotionally 
flat when they blocked him ... two 
or ibree times on the left side, and 
he was flat," Ball said. 

Ball also said he moved FeUpe 
Ralat back to the middle for (he 
fir^t time in a month, and he per- 
formed well. 

"^fy star of the (match] is Justin 
Luna, who I thought passed ibe ball 
really well, blocked some balls, dug 
balls," Ball said. 

"[The digs are] the difference in 
the game. 51 to 39 .,. that's twelve 
opportunities we didn't have to 
score thai tbey did," Ball said. 

Tlie loss dropped IPFW to 9-14 
while the Gauchos improved to 12- 
7. Penn Slate finished with a 13-3 
record and Ball State is now 15-8 
on the season.

Editor-in-Chief 

Basketball may have refined 
trash talk, bul volleyball gave a 
demonstration last Friday lo start 
off Ihe Farm Bureau/Baker and 
Daniels Invitational Volleyball 
toumamenu 

In Friday night's first maicb. 
Ball Slate came back from a two 
games lo one deficit lo beat the 
University of California-Santa 
Barbara, three games to two, and 
win a game marked by verbal jar- 
ring on boib sides. 

"Santa Barbara is really known 
for that ,,. so we were just trying lo 
give them a little something ihai 
they like to deal oui. We really 
don't do much of that, ordinarily. 
But Santa Barbara, in this tourna- 
ment, always geis us with that stuff. 

'This time, this team decided 
they weren't going to take il. They 
were going to get back at diem a lit- 
tle." BSU coach Don Shondell said. 

In the firsl game. BSU hit suc- 
cessfully 49 percent of ils kill 
aiiempls and had 17 digs to gel off 
to a good Stan. Greg Romano had 
eight kills in the game. 

UCSB came back in game two 
to win 16-14. Tie Gauchos hii 32 
percent and held the Volleycards to 
only 16kiJls. 

The Gauchos dominated game 
three, 15-6, holding BSU to a 10 
percent kill percentage and forcing 
11 aliack errors in ihe process. 

BSU came back from an 11-7 
deficit in game four and scored the 
nexi eight points to win the game. 
15-11, and even the match at two 
game apiece. The Volleycards had 
only 16 kills, bul dominated defen- 
sively at the net with six solo 
blocks and seven team blocks for 
the game. 

"[ think our guys just totally let 
up. they didn't push at all. And tbey 
scored eight straight points and beat 
us 15-11. We were up 11-7 ... we 
played horribly after that point ... 
we didn't really do anything to help 
ourselves from that point on. We 
got sluck one-on-one twice," UCSB 
coach Ken Preston said. 

"You can point to the whole 
match as being basically die end of 
the fourth game and the fifth 



Ball State pulls out vocal 
match with Santa Barbera 



game." Presion said. 

BSU won a hard-foughl game 
five, 15-13. The Volleycards sur- 
vived a 10 percent offensive perfor- 
mance by committing only one ser- 
vice error and gelling past the 
Gauchos' defense, allowing only 
four total blocks. 

Todd Reimer led BSU with 27 
kills while Greg Romano added 21 
kills and 12 digs. 

Robert Treahy paced the 
Gauchos with 34 kills and 38 per- 
cent efficiency while Amaury 
Velasco added 13 digs. UCSB had 
27 serving errors for the match, but 
Prcslon didn't think they were a 
problem. 

"We won the games we missed 
the mosi serves in, the third, for 
example ... 1 don't think thai was a 
problem, " Preston added. 

Sbondell disagreed. "That saved 
our neck t&gt;ccause tbey were serving 
lough as heck, and they were get- 
ting those nms of points off those 
jump serves, and that was wtiat was 
our problem. Toward the middle of 
the match, we jusl couldn't pass 
that serve, and Ihen all of the sud- 
den they just started missing it, and 
Ihen ... we get a chance to score, 
and the complexion of the game 
changes," he said. 

The Volleycards improved to 
15-7 while UCSB drtipped lo 11-7. 

The VoUeydons lost to Penn 
Stale University, three games lo 
zero, in Friday's second match, 
which was closer than the final 
results indicate. 

"It's kind of a package deal 
where our serving, we jusl made 
belter decisions serving and let our 
blocking defense take over from 
there," PSU coach Mark Pavlik 
said. 

"Are we making ibeir bitters 
work hard, arc we making iheir set- 
ter work bard, or are we just kind of 
handing tbem the ball and saying, 
'Please, jusl run Ibis down our 
throats'?" Pavlik added. 

The Nittany Lions dominated the 
first game. 15-6. by taking advan- 
tage of several IPFW serving errors 
and hitting 54 percent 

IPFW took leads of four to one 
and six to two before PSU came 
back lo within a point. Both teams 
took several leads before the 
VoUeydons threatened to end the 
game with possession and a 14-13 
lead. But PSU ouiscored IPFW four 
to one to end a hard match. 

IPFW started off well again the 
third game and stayed with the

Nittany Lions until ibe ninib point. 
From ihere, PSU jumped to a 12-9 
lead before ihe VoUeydons scored 
ihc next two points. PSU then 
ouiscored IPFW ihree to one to end 
the game. 15-12. and die match. 

"That seems to be the m.o. of 
our matches between us and Fort 
Wayne this year First games, we 
seem to have had our way with 
tbem and second games they've 
come out and jusl really, really 
pushed us. and kind of stayed al 
that level from there," Pavlik said. 

IPFW coach Arnie Ball was 
mon: critical of his own team. 

"Game two, It's 14-13, and we 
serve a lollipop and they side out. 
Then we give tbem a free ball and 
(hey score, It all comes back lo 
serving and passing 

"Tlic same iblng in game three. 
We jump ahead and tbey serve a 
couple of jump serves ... a couple 
we let bit the floor." Ball said. 

They have eight service aces; 
that's out of 45 points. 1 don't know 
what (hat percentage is off my 
head, but that's pretty slgnificani 
when we give up ihai many points 
in three games. 

"Their middles are bigger and 
stronger . if we don't serve the ball 
lough, and tbey run the middle, 
we're not going to stop them," Ball 
added. 

Craig Colhns had 18 kills to lead 
ihe VoUeydons as they recorded 14 
more assisted blocks than PSU. 
Ricardo Soler added 16 kills and 
eight digs. 

PSU's Ivan Contreras bad a 
match-high 19 kills. Ed Josefoski 
added IS kills and nine digs as the 
Nittany Lions hil for 43 percent for 
the match. 

"A lot of that has lo do with 
Carlos [Ortiz] making some real 
good decisions; I thought (ha( al 
lime we bogged down, wc got a lit- 
tle bil predictable, and then Carlos 
started running some more athletic 
routes .,. we used some of our 
movement ability, thai opened up 
our offense for us." Pavlik said.

we thought we would come back

Nalzke also said he thought 
Ihe VoUeydons were a L-ilenicd

as deep as they were last year 
The injuries to junior Brad

IPFW drops 
'ugly' match 
to Ball State 



By S. Bmnt Keltcy 
Editor-in-Chkr 

Volleyball icams don'l receive 
style points during play, and that's 
a good thing Tor both Ball Slate 
University's and IPFW's voUeybaJl 
teams. BSU won itie first meeting 
between the two teams Ihis year in 
a match which IPFW coach Amie 
Ball called "ugly. " 

"It was an ugly match Trom the 
standpoint ihat teams were making 
a lot of offensive errors and not hit- 
ting intelligent shots, but the excit- 
ing thing about it was the teams 
were playing probably a little bit 
harder than they were capable of 
playing," said BSU coach Don 
Shundell. 

"Both teams were working so 
very hard to win that game that the 
I energy expended on the conn was 
tremendous," Shondell added. 

Ball said, "It ... wasn't a very 
well executed game ... I thought 
both teams played hard, but it was 
one of Uiose nighLs where when we 
play hard, but nobody was quite In 
sine." 

"There was no pressure on us 
With the way we've been playing 
and the fact that we were down 
there, we always played well down 
there, I was real surprised we didn l 
play belter," Ball added. 

Ball State slipped by the 
Volleydons, 15-10. 6-15. 15-13 
12-15. 15-13, to win their first 
match over IPFW ever at 
University Arena and climb to sec 

Inttrcolleg!l&amp;ie ■^OHeyball . 
Association widi a 7-2 conference 
record. IPFW dropped lo third 
place with a 5-2 record in ihe 
MIVA. 

"It was a real disappointing 
match for us lo lose because if we 
would have won, that really would 
have put us in the driver's seal 
along with Ohio Stale and given 
Ball Stale three losses in our con- 
ference. Here's a team that has 
beaten UCLA, the number one 
team in the country, and it has three 
losses in our conference; it would 
have been great." Ball said 

BSU started the match hot, hit- 
ting 34 percent successfully in 
game one en route tea 15-10 vicio- 

fy- 

The Volleydons stormed back in 
game two and pounded BSU 15-6. 
IPFW hit 33 percent for the game 
while the Volleycards committed 
10 hitting errors to go with only 1 1 
kUls.

After the second game, neither 
team hit well. BSU hit 17 percent 
in the third game to squeak past the 
Volleydons. 15-13. 

IPFW woh game'four, 15-12. 
before dropping the final game, IS- 
IS. The Volleydons had only four 
kills and eight hitting errors in the 
final game. 

"We ... came back and won 
game four, and just were not strong 
enough side out-wise compared to 
them. So, in game five, we got 
behind them right away." Ball said. 

Outside hitter Craig Collins led 
IPFW with 18 kiUs and 17 digs as 
the Volleydons played a better 
defensive game than BSU. IPFW 
had 45 total blocks and 51 digs 
while the Volle^'cards recorded 
only 33 Iota! blocks, but 61 digs. 

Freshman Chris Fanner hit for 
40 percent for the match and setter 
Scott Lauer contributed five kills to 
go with his 49 assists. 

"We put the ball on Greg 
Romano, just lo slow him down ... 
we probably served him 95 percent 
of the balls, and I thought it was 
very effective;" Ball said. 

Todd Reimer had 18 kills lo lead 
BSU and four other Volleycird 
registered double figures in kill 
Scott Oelh was successful 57 pu

Fort Wayne was doing the

too hard and we were blocking 
them and they were makuig errorih 
Shondell added 

BSU erred m service 28 times 
"We were trying lo serve too 
strong," Shondell said. 

The Volleycards improved lo 
14-7 while the loss dropped IPFW 
to 9-12.

The IPFW men'i tennis team suf- 
fered a setback in their quest for ihe 
tennis leam'i first-ever Great Lakes 
Valley Conference tiHe. The team 
traveled lo Frankfort. Ky. and played 
two sets of matches against Kentucky 
Slate University and Bellarmine 
College. 

The team fell lo BC. five matches 
to four, in their first match last 
Saturday, (hen defeated the 
Thorobreds all nine matches later in 

IPFW coach Dan Brogan said the 
team may still conicnd for Ihe confer- 
ence championship. 

"I ihink we have a chance [for the 
GLVC title] ... We were a lilile dis- 
appointed we didn't win. bui it was a 
close match," said Brogan. 

Brogan said the players needed to 
improve individually on various parts 
o[ iltcir games. "Each player has to 
lake it upon himself lo improve on 
what he feels he needs to improve 
on," he said. 

IPFW now has a 3-2 record and

In Defense of a Little Virginity 

a message ftvm Focus on the Family 



Thefederal 

government has 

spent almost 

$3 billion of our 

taxes since 1970 

to promote 

contraceptives and 

' 'safe sex ' ' among 

our teenagers. Isn 't 

it time we asked. 

What have we 

gottenfor 

our money? 

Tliese are the facts: 

• The fafcniJ Ccnicrs for Disease 
Control cslimale thai ihcrc arc now I 
million caves uf HIV infection 
nation wide, ' 

• I in KX) sludenu coming to the 
Univeriily ofTcxas health center now 
carries the Ji^dly \'mxs} 

• The rate of helctDSCXual HIV 
Uunsini.uion has increased 44% since 
September 1989,^ 

■ Sc;(U!illy iransmillcd diseases 
(STDs) infect 3 million icenagera 
annually.' 

• 63% of all STD cases occur among 
persons less than 25 years of agc,^ 

• I million new cases of pelvic 
inflammatory disease occur annuaUy.' 

• 1,3 million nesv eases of gonorrhea 
occur annually'; strains of gononhea 
have dpYf^'^P^ ^3' trc rcsislani to 
penicillin. 

• Syphilis is at a 40-ycar high, with 
1 34,000 new infections per year." 

• 500.000 new cases of herpes occur 
annually^; it is estimated that 16.4% of 
the U.S. population ages 15-74 is 
infected, totaling mon: than 25 million 
Americans — among ccimin groups, the 
infection rate is as high as 60%.'" 

• 4 million cases of chlamydia occur 
annually"; 10-30% of 15-1019-year- 
olds arc infected." 

• TTiere are now 24 million cases of 
human papilloma vims (HPV). with a 
higher prcvnicncc among teens." 

To date, over 20 different and 
dangerous sexually transmitted diseases 
are rampant among the young. Add to 
that the problems associated with 
promiscuous behavior infertility, 
abortions and infected newborns. The 
cost of this epidemic is staggering, both 
in human suffering and in expense to 
society, yet epidcmiologisLs tell us 
we've only seen the beginning. 

Incndibly, ihe "safe-sejc" gurus and 
condom pronwlers h7io got us into this 
rtess art stiU determining our policy 
rrganling adotffcenl stLxualily. Their 
ideas liavefaiJed. and is is time to rahink 
their bankrupt policies. 

How long has it been since you've 
heard anyone tell teenagers why it is to 
flieir advantage to remain virgins until 
married? The facts me being withheld 
from them, with tragic conMxjuences. 
Unless we come to icims with the 
sickness that stalks a generation of 
Americans, teen pron\iscuity will 
continue, and millions of kids . . . 
thinking they are proteaed . . . svill 
suffer for the KSl of their lives. Many 
will die of AIDS. 

There is only one safe w~ay to remain 
healthy in the midst of a sexual 
resolution, li is to abstain from 
intercourse uniil maniagc, and then wed 
and be faithful to an uninfected panner. 
It is a concept that was widely endoised 
in society until the 1960s. Since then, a 
"better idea" has come along . , . one 
that now threateas the entire human 
family. 

Inesitable questions are raised 

whenever abstinence is pn^posed Its 

e ga\e some clear answers: 



\Vh&gt;, apart fmiii moral 
cons idem dons, dt&gt; you think 
tcc^a^er^ &lt;&gt;Iiould be I^tighl to 
abstain from scv until marriage? 

,N'ii (iiher approach lo the epidemic of 
sexually iransmiiied diseases will work. 
TTie so-called "safe-sex" solution is a 
disaster in the making. Condoms can fail 
at least 1 5.7 pereent of the time annually 
in preventing pn;gnancy " They fail 
36.3 pereent of the time annually in 
presenting pregnancy among young, 
unmarried minority women, In a study 
of homosexual men. the British Medical 
Jiiiimal reported the failure rate doe to 
slippage and breakage to be 26 percent."' 
Given these findings, it is obvious why 
we have a word for people who rely 
on condoms as a means of birth 
control. We call them, 
"parents." 

Remembering that 
a woman can 
conceive only one or 
two days per month, 
we can only guess 
hosv high the failure 
rate for condoms 
must be in preventing 
disease, which can be 
Iransmillcd 365 days 
per year' If the 
devices are not used 
properly, or if they slip 
just once, vimscs and 
bacteria arc exchanged 
and the disease proccs.s begins. One 
mistake after 500 "proteclcd" episodes is 
all it takes to contract a sexually 
transmitted disease. The damage is done 
in a single moment when rational 
thought is overridden by passion. 

Those who would depend on so 
insecure a method must use it properly 
on every occasion, and even then a high 
failure raic is brought about by factors 
beyond dicir control. The young victim 
who is told by his elders diat this little 
latex device is "safe" mfiy not know he 
is risking lifelong pain and es'en death 
for so brief a window of pleasure. What 
a burelcii to place on an immature mind 
and body! 

Then we must rccogni/c diat there 
are other differences between pregnancy 
prevention and disease prevention. HIV 
is l/25lh the width ofsperm," and can 
pass easily through even the smallest 
gaps in condoms. Rescorehei^ snjdying 
surgical gloves made out of latex, the 
same material in condoms, found 
"channels of 5 microns that pcnctraied 
the entire thickness of the elove."" 
HIV measures , 1 microas. Given these 
findings, what rational, informed person 
would imst his or her veiy life to such 
flimsy armor? 

This surely cxplaias why not one of 
800 sexologists at a conference a few 
yeai^ ago raised a hand when asked if 
they would ti\ist a d\in mbber sheath to 
protect them during intercourse with a 
known HIV-infected person." Who 
could blame them? They're not crazy, 
after all And yet they're perfecdy 
wiUing lo tell our kids that "safe sex" is 
within reach and that Ihcy can sleep 
.uound with impunity. 

There is only one way to protect 
our^lves from the deadly diseases that 
lie in wait. It is abstinence before 
marriage, then marriage and mutual 
fidelity for life lo an uninfected parmer. 
Anything less is potentially suicidal. 
That position ts simply NOT 
nalistic today. It's an unworkable 
solution: Kids will NOT 
implement it 

Some will. Some won'L It's still the 
only answer. But let's talk about an 
'■unworkable solution" of the fust onder. 
Since 1970, the federal govcrrunent has 
spent nearly S3 bilQon to promote 
contraception and "safe sex." This year 
alone. 450millionof your tat dollars 
will go down that drain!*' (Compared 
with less than S8 million for absiinence 
pnapams. svhich Sen. Teddy Kennedy 
and company have sought repeatedly to 
eliminate altogether.) Isn't it lime we ask 
what wc'se gotten for our money? After 
22 years and nearly S3 billion, some 58 
petcent of teenage giris under 18 siill did 
not use contraception during dieir fir^i 
intercourse," Furthermore, leenagets 
tend 10 keep having unprotected 




iniereoutse for a full year, on average. 
before stalling any kind of 
contraception,'' Thai is the success ratio 
of the experts who call abstinence 
"unrealistic" and "unworkable," 

Even if we spent another S50 billion 
to promote condom usage, most 
teenagers would still not use them 
consistently and properly. The nature of 
human beings and the passion of the act 
simply do not lend themselves lo a 
disciplined response in young romantics. 
But if you knew a teenager was 
going to have intercourse, 
wouldn't you leach him or her 
about proper condom usage? 

No, becaase that approach has iin 
unintended coaseC|ucnce, The process of 
recommending condom usage lo 
teenagets inevitably conveys five 
dangerous ideas: ( I ) that "safe 
&gt;ex" is achievable: (2) that 
everybody is doing it; (3) that 
revponsible adults e.xpect them 
h&lt; do It: (4) that it's a good 
ihing; and (5) diat their peers 
know they know dicsc 
things, breeding 
proiniscuity. Those arc 
very dcstmctivc 
messages to gist 
our kids. 
Funhemiore, 
Planned 
Parenthood 's 
own daLi show 
thai die number ■ 
teenagers engage in 
intercourse is peer pressure!'' Therefore. 
anything we do lo imply that "every- 
body is doing it" rcsulLs in more ... not 
fewer , . , people who give die game a 
try. Condom disuibution programs do 
not reduce the number of kids exposed 
10 disease . . , they radically increase it! 

Want proof of that fact? Since the 
federal govemmeni began its major 
contraception program in 1970. unwed 
pregnancies have increased 87 peieeni 
among 15- to 19-y car-olds," Likewise, 
abortions among tecas rose 67 percent;^ 
unwedbirlhs went up61 percent. "And 
venereal disease has infected a 
genemdon of young people. Nice job, 
sex counselors. Good dtinking, senators 
and congressmen, Nice nap, America 

Having made a blunder that 
now threatens the human 
family, one would think die 
designers would be 
backtracking and apologizing 
for their miscalculaUons. 
Instead, diey continue i 
lobby Congress and 
corporate America for 
money. Given the 
misinformation extant 
this subject, they'll 
probably gel it. 

But if you were 
a parent and knew thai 
your son or daughter 
was having sex, wouldn't 
you rather he or she used a 
condom? 

How much risk is acceptable when 
you're tidking about your teenager's life? 
One study of married couples in which 
one partner svas infected with HIV found 
that 17"^ of the partners using condoms 
for protection siill cnughi die virus within 
a year and a half.^Telllng our teeas to 
"reduce their risk" to one m six (17%) is 
not much better than advocating Ru.ssian 
roulelte. Bodi are fatal, eventually. The 
difference ls that widi a gun, death is 
quicker. Suppose your son or daughter 
were joining an 1 8-monlh skydiving club 
of six members. If you knew that one of 
dieir parachutes would definitely fail, 
would you recommend thai diey simply 
buckle die chutes tighter'? Certainly not. 
You would say, "Please don't jump. 
Your life is ai stake!" How could a 
loving parent do less"" 

Kids won't listen to the 
abstinence message. You're just 
wasting your breath W try to 
sell them a notion like that

A few years ago in Le&lt;.ingiiin. K\.. a 
&gt;iiulh escni was held that featured no 
spurts conicsi. no rock groups— just an 
e\&lt;on\ ii.t niiincd Har»ild Morris talking 
about absHncnic. .uimng niher subjects. 
The coliseum scaled I S.ftKI people, but 
26.&lt;XX) teenagers showed up! 
Eventually, more ihan 2.1KXI sHxkI 
out.side the packed auditorium and 
listened over a hastily prewired 
public address ^y-icm, Who 
says kids w on*i lisicn lo this 
lime- honored me.ssiigc'' 

tven tc-cns who have 
been sexually aciise can 
choose lo Slop, This is often 
called "secondary virginity." 
ii good concept that conveys 
the idea dial kids can start 
oser. One young girl a'c-cnil; 
wrote Ann LandctN to say 
she wished she had kept ^ j 
her virginity, .signing, ihe ^0 
Icitcr, "Sony I didn't and ^ 

wish I could take il back. " As 
responsible adulLs wc need lo tell 
her diat even though she can'i go 
back, she can go ^or^vard, She can 
regain her self-respect and proicci her 
health, because it's never loo late to start 
saying "no" lo prem.irilal sex. 

Even though the safe-se\ 
advtK'iites predominate in 
educational circles, are there no 
p4)siUvc examples of abstinence- 
based programs for kids? 

Thankfully, some excellent programs 
have been developed. Spokane-based 
7W/i-/t/V/ and Chicago's Smi/Mici/ 
Pimmis Coiruiiiiiec arc g(Kid ex;implcs. 
So ;irc Neil Generation in Maryland, 
Cliuicfs in California and Rexpeci Inc. in 
Illinois. Odicr curricula such as Facing 
Rculiiy: Sex Kespeci; Mc. My World. My 
Fiiliirc: RcasonahU- Reasons lo Wiiil: 
Sex. Love &lt;S Ow/tw. F.A.CT.S. etc., 
are all abstinence- die nied prognuns to 
help kids make good sexual decisions. 

A good curriculum for inner-city 
youth is Elaync Benneli'sfle.tr f rif/u/j 
Program. This successful "mentoring" 
project helps adolescents in Washington, 
DC. graduate from high school and 
remain abstinent. In five years, not one 
female has become pregnant while in the 
Friends Program'. 
hsiablishing and nurturing 
ideas with kids, 
awcvcr, can be like spitting 
ito die wind. Not because 
they won't listen, because 
most will. But pro- 
ibslinencc 
messages arc 
drowned out in 
a.sea of toxic 

incviiable-use-a- 
:ondom 
propaganda from 

pmfe.ssionals. 
You place major 
responsibility on those who 
have lold adolescents that sextial 
expression is their riglit as long as 
they do il "properly." Who else has 
contributed to the epidemic? 

The enlcnainrncni industry musi 
certainly sharc the blame, including 
television producers. It is inlciesling in 
this context that all four networks and 
the cable television endlies are wringing 
their hands about diis icniblc epidemic 
of AIDS. They profess lo be very 
concerned about those who arc infected 
widi sexually uansmillcd diseases, and 
perhaps they arc sincere. However. TV 
executives and movie mpguls have 
conuibuted mightily lo the cxisicoec of 
diis plague. For decades, diey have 
depicted teens and young adulLs 
climbing in and nut of each other's ticds 
like so many sexual robots. Only die 
nerds were shown to be chaste, and dtcy 
were too stupid or ugly to find partners.
