Into the Mind of 

A.J. JACOBS, 



The-Know-lt-AU 



By Said El-Dajani 

onlan@iplwc 



k?r"'1 



As a writer, AJ. Jacobs has spent his career im- 
mersing himself into lifestyles and projecis Ihen 
chronicling his experiences. Essentially a guinea pig, 
lacobs sees his life as a series of experiments. 

in a past experiment, Jacobs read all 32 volumes 
of the Encyclopaedia Brilannica, then wrote about it 
in his humorous book, The Know-lt-All: One Man's 
Humble Quest to Become the Smartest Person in die 
World (2004). 

Raised in a secular family, his lack of religion grow- 
ing up was incentive for him to embark on a thorough 
journey of living morally for one year, abiding by the 
700 rules of the bible, literally. 

"I am Jewish in the same way that the Olive Gar- 
den is Italian," says Jacobs, who started his journey 

IPFWs Upcoming 

Annual Health Fair 



with a stack of bibles, one of which was a hip-hop 
version that claims, 'the lord is all that." 

The result of his experiment was a neivfound ap- 
proach to life, tivins, and a book entitled My Year of 
Living Biblically: One Man's Humble Quest to Follow 
the Bible as Literally as Possible (2007). 

The account is hailed as comical and profound, 
reverent and irrational, personal and universal, and 
it will make you see history's most influential book 
ivith new eyes. According to an IPFW press release, 
Jacobs embeds himself in a cross-section of commu- 
nities that take the Bible literally: He wresdes with 
seemingly archaic rules that baffle the 21st-century 
brain, and he discovers ancient ivisdom of startling 
relevance. zine, among others. Jacobs has appeared on Oprah, 

A.I. lacobs is a New York Times bestselling author The Today Show, Good Morning America, and is a 
and Esquire editor. He has written for The New York periodic commentator on NPR's Weekend Edition 
Times, Entertainment Weekly, and New York Maga- Saturday

How satisfied are you 
with the current food 
services and options at 
IPFW? Is food here too 
expensive? Not healthy 
enough? Whether stu- 
dents believe IPFWneeds 
a new cafeteria, more 
restaurants, or better 
vending machines, at- 
tending the Food Service 
Roundtable Discussion 
may be a good way to ex- 
press one's concerns. 

The Student Affairs 
Committee of IPSGA is 
hosting a roundtable dis- 
cussion Men., March 23 
between 12:30 p.m. and 
1:15 p.m. in Walb room 
222-224. There will be 
free food provided by 
Blue Spoon Catering. 
Food options at IPFW 



will be discussed, com- 
mittee hopes that that 
this will start to close 
the gap between smdent 
government and the stu- 
dent body. 

The Food Service 
Roundtable is an oppor- 
tunity for students to ex- 
press their opinions on 
the future of IPFW food 
services. Dr. McClel- 
lan. Vice-chancellor of 
Student Affairs, will also 
be in attendance to par- 
ticipate and listen to the 
discussion, 

"Student Affairs is in 
charge of representing 
and championing the 
interests of the student 
body to student govern- 
ment and the admin- 
istration," committee 
member Amanda Marks 
said, "In order to do that 
we need to have a clear 
idea of what those inter- 
ests are, and that requires 
direct feedback from the 
students themselves." 




Everything you ever wanted 
to know about a 401 (k) 



By Jessie Ruckman 

Jessie. RudimanO 
ip fwcommunicato r.org 



Say you have a good job with ben- 
efits and a 401 (k) package. You work 
faithfully and contribute five percent 
of your pre-tax income to your relire- 
ment fund, and if you're realty lucky, 
the company for which you work is 
land enough in this economic climate 
to match pan of your contribution. In 
30 years, you should be all set for re- 
tirement, ready to buy that boat and 
sail your wrinkled self into the simset, 
right? 

Hate to burst your bubble, but you 
would be wrong. Some people who are 
ready to retire now, or within the next 
couple of years are having to push their 
retirement date back or worse because 
their retirement funds have tanked. 1 
look at my parents, who have both 
faithfully contributed to their 401 (k) 
retirement funds, only to have the bulk 
of it disappear into the nebulous. 

Say you've heard of a 401 (k) fund, 
but don't really know how it works. I 
didn't either, but 1 had a hunch that 
your pre-tax income was invested into 
the stock market via eidier straight 
stocks, mutual funds or whatever else 
investment companies decide is right 
for your money. 

According lo Joshua Kennon, an 
investment bloggcr for http://about. 
com, "A 401k retirement plan is a spe- 



cial type of account funded through 
pre-tax payroll deductions. The funds 
in the account can be invested in a 
number of different stocks, bonds, mu- 
tual funds or other assets, and are not 
taxed on any capital gains, dhndends, 
or interest until ttiey are withdrawn." 

Basically, your money is put into 
the stock market, where for the last few 
years, was a relatively safe place. Today, 
these markets are volatile, gaining and 
losing dividends with the fluctuation of 
a bulimic movie star. 

So, my point is this: diversify where 
your money goes. ] do invest four per- 
cent of my pre-tax income automatical- 
ly into my 401 (k) retirement fund, but 
1 also have a Roth IRA to supplement 
for retirement. If your company offers 
a retirement account such as a 401 (k) 
or equivalent, you would be a fool not 
lo use it. Frankly, I don't even miss that 
four percent, and never noticed that 
it had gone elsewhere, where it would 
work for my future, it's very easy to 
sign up, and takes only a few minutes 
to invest in your future. But you would 
also be wise to supplement your 401 (k) 
with something else, like either a tradi- 
tional or a Roth IRA. 

Interested? Next week, we'll discuss 
the pros and cons of IRAs, but I'll tell 
you ahead of time, I'm a big fan. Un- 
til then, read up on 401 (k) retirement 
funds at the following web sites:

Lack of zoo space jeopardizes baby hippo's life op-ed

tiny Hippopotamus 

named Farasi snuggles 

ip to his mother at the 

Basel Zoo in Svvilzerland. He's 

a tiny thing; his specWed body 

is stumpy and his legs barely 

seem to move him around. 

But he's hauntingly cute,

A concrete decision will hap- 
pen in about ten months, when 
Farasi will be old enough to leave 
the care of his mother, a hippo 
named Helvetia. Maybe he will be 
fed to the lions, maybe Basel Zoo

he'll end up doing tricks for the 
circus. 

The best option would be to 
have him sent to an African pre- 
serve, where he can live out his 
days vvithout fear of being mali- 
ciously killed for ill-planning space 
issues he had no control over.

wondering how Farasi will live with 
lack of space. "If we don't find a 
good place, he might be killed and 
eaten by other animals in the zoo," 
zoo spokeswoman Tania Dietrich 
said to the news service Swnssinfo 
shordy after Farasi was bom. 

The preferred option is not to 
transfer Farasi to another zoo— it's 
to kill him and throw his 220-poimd 
body into a lion cage, where it will 
be shamelessly devoured within a 
matter of seconds. This is not an 
African safari, where this might . 
happen naturally^ on the contrary, 
it is happening in a zoo, which is 
supposed to be a place for the dis- 
play and preservation ofanimals. 

Many other European zoos, 
like Basel, have created an over- 
abundance of animals thai have 
no place to live. The extra animals 
end up living in horrible condi- 
tions while waiting on a crowded 
list to find a placement with an- 
other zoo. Farasi is on a Surplus 
List for European zoos. It is a list 
ttiat more than 18,500 animals are 
placed on each year, according to

Fort Wayne's Gem Collection

Cheap Books Glistens in Bad Economy 



Did your ex-bojlriend leave a stack of CDs be- 
hind ihat you don't know what to do v%ith? Got piles 
of books cluttering up your apartment? Missing that 
one book in your most cherished series, but don't 
ever seem to have the money to finish the collection? 
On March 12th. Half Price Books opened to help solve 
your problems. 

One of the most beloved bookstores in the coun- 
try, Half Price Books is finally making the move to 
Fort WajTie. The store is open at 533 E. Coliseum 
Blvd., next to Carlos O'Kelly's in the strip mall across 
the street from Panera and Bob Evans. They've been 
open for about a month already, getting the store in 
shape and alloiving customers to come in and browse 
and sell. 

In addition to offering an entire store of books at 
half off cover price (and sometimes well below), the 
store buys hooks, monies, music, and games. I recent- 
ly brought in a couple dozen books and tvvo DVDs and 
walked out with a little over S60 cash within minutes 
Selling is as much fun as bu\'ing at Half Price: you 
bring your stuff to the Sell Books Here counter and 
their team of buyers paws througli your stuff, evalu- 
ates it, and then calls you over the intercom when 
they have an offer ready. Of course, they hope you've 
had time to wander around and find a few books to 
pick up with the cash they hand you. 

Half Price Books isn't what you normally think of 
when you picture a used bookstore. It's bright, clean, 
and well organized. The books are in great condition, 
and they even have a ton of new books at half cover 
price. They do this through partnerships with pub- 
lishers (including game companies) in which Half 
Price buys overstocks (Tony Warmus, district man- 
ager for the Indianapolis region, estimated the stores 
are about 30% new products). You quickly realize that 
regularly \isiting the store can hear fruit, as they are 
constantly slocking their shelves with newly acquired 
books, changing their discount displays around, and 



"People tend to form personal 

connections with their local 

Half Price Books." 



featuring sales and other fun promotions. 

People tend to form personal connections ivith 
their local Half Price Books. There is just something 
about the smell of the books on wooden shelves, the 
old LP covers plastered on the bathroom walls, and 
the quirky staff that encourages you to come back 
over and over again. The stores reciprocate this affec- 
tion by becoming involved in their local communi- 
ties. 

They offer a no-strings-attached 10% discount 
card to all teachers and librarians. Store managers 
also work with local charities to hold book drives and 
find places to donate media on a regular basis. Lo- 
cally, the new store is partnering \vith the IPFW art 
department to feature the works of student artists on 
the walls, and is looking to partner with local com- 
munity' centers and children's hospitals to donate 
books. 

In addition, what they can't sell, they recycle using 
a local recycling option. At halfpricebooks.com you 
can find several resources devoted to the company's 
philosophy of recycling and protecting the environ- 
ment. It's an integral part of their corporate culture 
and their mission. 

The store is doing good things for the local econo- 
my as well, and not just by providing a treasure trove 
of half price goodies. They hired seventeen employ- 
ees to work at the store, and while they're no longer 
hiring at the moment, Warmus told me that they are 



always accepting applications. 

Excitement is already building surrounding their 
opening, Warmus related to me a story of one Sunday 
afternoon when they weren't open but were inside 
stocking the shelves. Two older ladies drove by ver^' 
slowly in their car, peering at the signs on the win- 
dows, trying to see what was inside. Once they real- 
ized what the store was and without seeing anyone 
looking back from inside, they both gave a thumbs 
up symbol to the storefront, grinned, and then drove 
off.

Authentic Vietnamese, 

The Saigon Offers Best Crab Rangoon in Town 



Nana Thoughts 

By Hana Hawash

My Name Is Hana, Pronounced Henna 



By Kelly McLendon 

kelly.fnclendDn.ipfwcominur^kator.org 



Its soup graced the cover of Fort 
Wayne Magazine in February, Patrons 
say the restaurant has the best crab 
rangoon in town. The Saigon, located 
at 2006 South Calhoun Street, is a gem 
of a restaurant that nobody seems to 
know about. In fact, it's one of the best 
well-kept secrets in the city. 

Diners to the Vietnamese venue 
will find a crowded dining area and a 
busy waitstaff, but a diverse selection 
of food choices, including Vietnamese, 
Chinese and of course, American. But 
you don't really go to such an authentic 
restaurant to just order chicken fingers 
and fries. You go there to order menu 
items like Kung Pao chicken and Beef 
Noodle bowls. 

Ranked on Yahoo! Travel restau- 
rant reviews as 4.5 stars out of 5, The 
Saigon isn't a restaurant to be missed, 
"Saigon is an unpretentious, under- 
slated, wholly authentic Vietnamese 
restaurant. The Vietnamese and Chi- 
nese food is plentiful, well prepared 
and tasty and tl ,• prices simply can't 
be beaten. A great value." one reviewer 
commented. 

The Yahoo! site contained six re- 



views for the restaurant, all of which 
had great things to say about the food, 
but less than adequate comments 
about the service. 

"I think that Saigon has good food, 
but the sen-ice lacks somewhat. It takes 
a bit for the food even when they are 
not busy, though it's worth the wait." 
another reviewer said. 

It's true that when you sit dovm at 
The Saigon during a busy lunch rush, 
it will take your ser\'er more than just a 
few minutes to get to your table. When 
she does, however, be prepared to or- 
der and your food will be out of the 
kitchen faster than it takes for you to 
talk about the weather with your din- 
ing companions. 

Since the crab rangoon comes high- 
ly recommended, it's only natural that 
you should order it. One order con- 
tains three delicious deep fried shells 
filled with a mixture of crab and cream 
cheese, expertly blended into a melt- 
in-your-mouth concoction. 

The rest of the menu is just as deli- 
cious and for some patrons, even worth 
driving for, 

"I've been going to Saigon for over 7 
years now and the place never changes! 
I drive sometimes up to 2 hours just to 
get Saigon. That must say something!" 
a third reviewer said. 



Have a question that you are figu- 
ratively or quite literally dying for an 
answer to? Not getring an answer that 
satisfies your thirst for knowledge in 
the way of die human and or animal 
species? This may actually be the 
luckiest day of your life. This is the 
beginning of a column that will not 
only answer your questions directly, 
but from a different perspective you 
might not have even thought of be- 
fore. Basically, I'm here to open your 
mind and fill it with all sorts of knowl- 
edge and useful tips. 

Let me introduce myself. My 
name is Hana, pronounced Henna; 
this is crucial in the most unimport- 
ant way, 1 am an "on the fence" sort 
of person, giving me the ability to see 
things from many different perspec- 
tives. The goal of this column is to an- 
swer IPFW students' questions as well 
as discuss and clarify other topics that 
may be of importance to the campus 
or student body. 

Here's how this will work; You, the 
reader, will ponder your plethora of 
questions. 

Once you have decided what you 
really want to understand or receive 
an answer to, you may send your 
question in via e-mail. I, the unli- 
censed writer, researcher and advi- 
sor will then attempt to answer your 




question. Not all questions submitted 
will receive a printed answer, but bear 
in mind that I will advise and help you 
understand anything on a one-on-one 
level if you wish. 

Questions submitted can be about 
anything from make-up advice to how 
to deal with a perturbed co-worker - 
let us not be shy.

mation column will inspire, clarify and 
counsel in a considerately humorous 
manner. I will not only be giving you 
my own thoughts and experiences, 
but 1 will be giving you the thoughts

ever witnessed, playing new and old 
songs alike. Songs from their new al- 
bum. Common Existence, included 
a version of "Recussitation of a Dead 
Man " featuring Rise Against lead vocal- 
ist Tim Mcilrath. Thursday also played 
fan favorites such as "Understanding

There's something beautiful about a 
compact disc. First, there's its circular shape, 
which sj^nbolizes the unending cycle of death, 
rebirth and a life of gaming. Then there's its art, a 
teaser ofthe wondrous beauties 10 be witnessed 
upon a game's installation; the physical solidity 
of the thing — the fact that you can hold a disc 
in your hand and just stare at it for a minute, 
letting the feeling sink in: "This game is gonna 
be awesome." 

But games on discs are slowly becoming 
obsolete. The first things to go are expansion 
packs, which, especially on consoles, are 
starting tobe available exclusively as downloads. 
Something just doesn't feel right about this. 
The vicious behemoth some blindly call "the 
Internet" is already devouring physical, paper- 
bound books as we know them. Why does it 
have to prey on games, too? 

Now, the matter is obviously different for 
games than it is for books. Wlien a book is 
put online, the format in which people read it 
changes. Yet no matter how you go about buying 
the game, you still play it on the same screen, 
Wliat the disappearance of die disc means for 
gamers is an end lo the wondrous process of 
buying a video g 



and anticipating playing it. | 

Some of my favorite childhood momen 
were spent in Best Buy 1 would rush into thestoi 
and make a mad dash for the game I wantei 
Once 1 got my grubby litde fingers on it, I woul 
turn it over In my hands, reading every sing 
letter printed on the shiny and colorful new bo 
right down to the distribution info and seizui 
warnings. Once I had scanned it thoroughly, 
would walk up and down the aisles looking ; 
the vast array of other games and watching tl 
bigger kids play ^^^^^^^^=^=^^^^ 
demos, all the 
while clutching 
the box tighdy 
to make sure 
nobody tried to 
steal it. 

As soon as we 
got back to the 
car — if I could 
wait that long 

— I would rip off the plastic and open the bo 
finally beholding the disc itself. As 1 did with tl- 
box's text, I would diligently scour every paj 
of the instruction booklet, stopping only whe 
we got home and I could finally experience lY 
game first-hand. These were fun iimes.

But today's youth are simultaneously 
spoiled and deprived by their own impatience. 
Sure, when you doivnload a game right to your 
system you can play it right away, but where's 
the fun in that? Nobody plays any one game 
forever, so it's not like you're losing any play 
time by going on an adventure to the store to 
pick the game up yourself. 

Also, the last thing gamers need is a way 

to become even more sedentary. In (he world 

of yesterj'ear, you could always buy a game

without leaving 

your house. But

possibly even getting 
air in the process. 

But there's also an economic aspect to those 
sneak&gt;' game publishers' decision to move 
online: They're killing the used game market. 
Sure, you'll still be able to sell your old Xbox and 
Gamecube games, but for how long? As newer 



systems come out, tlie market for retro gaming 
becomes narrower and narrower And the older 
the system, the harder it is to find a functioning 
console. 

Games that are downloaded can't be bought 
and sold after the initial purchase. They're 
on your hard drive, and that's where they're 
staying. It's a sinisterly clever move by the 
game companies, who are basically assuring 
themselves financially by making everyone who 
wants to play a game on their own console buy 
their own copy. You can't even borrow from a 
friend anymore. 

The advent of the downloadable game is 
going to have unforeseeable consequences on 
stores like GameSpot, so I won't attempt to 
foresee their futures with any particular degree 
of specificity. But suffice it to say this: A store 
that sells video games will have a hard time 
making it when video games are no longer sold 
in stores. Duh, 

Whether you're a retro kid like me who 
thinks that discs and game bo.ves are just plain 
pretty or a hardcore gamer who's worried that 
he won't be able to mooch his friend's copy of 
the next "Grand Tlieft Auto," there's something 
just plain wrong about selling games solely via 
download. Besides, the Internet is probably just 
a fad. 




Audacious 

Graffiti Artist 



By Nana Hawash 

a.hawatheipfwcommuniutoF 



Graffiti is not always 
appreciated when sprayed 

on public and private 
property alike, but recent 
graffiti found all over the 
world may soon change 
that. Political street artist 
Banksy, whose true iden- 
tity is unknoivn, has start- 
ed something that will 
change how the public 
will come to view graffiti. 

Banksy is from Bristol 
in the UK, where most of 
his workcan be found, but 
he has recendy accom- 
plished something bigger. 
He traveled to Palestine 
to paint on the segrega- 
tion wall that Israel began 
constructing in 2003. Ac- 
cording to Banksy, who 
refuses to have pictures 
taken so that his identity 
may remain a secret, the 
wall is "the ultimate activ- 
ity holiday destination for 
graffiti writers." (news. 
bbc.co.uk) 

Banksy has painted 
things that are represen- 
tative of the feelings of the 
Palestinian people such as 
a ladder leading over the 
wall and children digging 
through the wall to free- 
dom. The most represen- 
tative is the peace dove 
carrying an olive branch 
wearing a bullet proof 
jacket. This represents 
how the people want and 
believe in peace, yet it is 
overtaken by violence. 

Though his work in 
Palestine is probably 
noticed, he 



has done plenty in the 
UK as well. The point of 
Banksy 's work is to mock 
society's daily rat race, 
which he constantly rep- 
resents with paintings 
of everyday scenes such 
as children playing, the 
queen or policemen in a 
t^visted, and sometimes 
dark, new light. On the 
side of a building in Pal- 
estine there is a painting 
ofa little girl searching an 
Israeli soldier who is car- 
rying a gun, rather than 
the soldier searching her. 
On the side wall of a gas 
station, he painted a Pal- 
estinian man throwing a 
bouquet of flowers rather 
than stones, something 
Palestinians have been 
mocked for for years. 

Banksy, whose name 
is alleged to be Roben 
Banks, has been arrested 
in the past for the "bad 
art" on private and public 
property. One of his great- 
est accomplishments was 
putting a mock version of 
a famous painting in the 
British Museum, which 
went unnoticed for three 
days. He also painted on 
a private home property, 
which was later sold as 
artwork with a house at- 
tached. 

Banksy's work will go 
down in history as a sign 
of independent thought 
and in an artistic form, 
free speech. For more in- 
formation pertaining to 
Banksy and his work in 
Palestine and other coun- 
tries, you can visit his

Of those tliree, only Mohammed 
Esseghir, who left in Fife's first season 
and ended up at South Florida, was 
outspoken at all when he left the 
program. D] Posley left at the end of 
that year, but as a pre-Fife recruit, he 
wasn't expected by many outside the 
program to stick around. Posley spent 
this year as a senior at the University of 
California Santa Barbara afet averaging 
17 points per game in one year at |ohn 
Woods Community College after he 
left IPFW. Posley was an Ail-American 
on the luCo level. The team also lost 
then-senior Zeljko Egeric last year for 
undisclosed reasons. And, there has 
seemed to be no general discontent 
within the program, no suspensions or 
long-term issues. 

Scheduling • C- 

This year's schedule was loaded 
with four teams who are headed to 
the NCAA Tournament and with the 
exception of a great outing against 
Michigan State, none of those were 
remotely close in score. The same can 
be said for previous seasons including 
his first. In his first year at the helm. 
Fife scheduled aggressively and was 
met ivith a 4-12 record against non- 
independent teams (IPFW was stiil 
conference free). 

The main goal of scheduling is not 
to get easy wins, unless you are North 
Carolina or Kansas, but instead to 



prepare your team for conference play. 
That was harder to do in his first two 
seasons with IPFW as an Independent, 
so it's almost compelling to give him 
an incomplete here. However, his 
scheduling this year and last (throw in 
big losses at Wisconsin and Nebraska) 
shows thai while taking big risks may 
pay off,\vith a big reward, it has not 
prepared them for Summit League play 
as much as a team would ideally like. 
In 2007-2008, they won their first two 
conference games ever but dropped 
the next tluee in a row by an average of 
17 points. This year, they started 1-4 in 
the league. 

Preperation • B 

Along with a tough schedule comes 
tough days or weeks leading up to 
those games. And while Fife's schedule 
has often put IPFW in rough spots, he 
has done a solid job preparing them to 
have a big game mentality. 

Fife, a former National Tide game 
participant, knows a thing or two about 
big game scenerios and the team's start 
against Michigan State this season 
alone shows that he knows how to 
get a group of guys ready. There have 
been few games at all, including those 
not against national powers, where the 
team did not seem prepared. 

The most notable hold back here is 
the nasty thorn in IPFW'sside; Oakland. 
The team seemed flat in parts of all 
three meetings. In none of the three 
meetings did they seem prepared for 
all of Oakland's weapons. 

In-Game Coaching • C 

It is hard to gage a coach's 



performance in games for several 
different reasons. The help of his 
assistants, the receptive nature of his 
players, his ammouni of expereince 
coaching in games; they all play a 
role. Especially in the case of Fife, who 
started his career at IPFW with no prior 
head coaching experience. 

It's been nodcable that Fife has 
become increasingly a litde less active 
each year on the sidelines, except when 
angry at his team or the officials. Lucidly 
in that, he is also no Bob Knight and he 
does seem to have solid awareness of 
how to patrol the sidelines properly. 
Fife knows when and when not to 
push the officials. Also, Fife seems all 
too aware of the crowd during games. 
Several times, he has turned around to 
slightly acknowledge a comment, be it 
good or bad. 

Wlien it comes to coaching on garne 
day, you don't have to be thebesi as long 
as you have done your job throughout 
■ the week to prepare for die team yoii 
are facing. The better you are in the 
other four catagories mentioned here, 
the more slack you can have in the in- • 
game coaching area. 

Overall • B 

The press conference where Dane 
Fife was announced as the next head 
coach at IPFW is a crystal clear memory 
from IPFW's Division I past. Former 
athletic director Mark Pope was right 
thenwhen he said-Dane Fife islhe right 
person at the right time for IPFW." 

The statement is just as true now. 
No, in his first four years, Fife has not

Illinois, Buter. St. Bonaventure, 
Iowa State - just a sarnpling of games 
that IPFW coach Chris Paul would like 
to get a do-over on. 

Those opponents, teamed with 13 
others helped railroad IPFW into a 2-17 
record at the beginning of the season. 
But then Paul's Masotodons hit the 
right stride at the right time, winning 
six of their last seven before a close 
loss to lUPUI in the opening round of 
the Summit

back. After

lUPUI in Indianapolis a week prior to 

the tournament, the post-season loss 

was a hard one to swallow. 

"You have to give them credit for 
battling back," Paul said after the game. 
"We played and defeated them about 
(two weeks) ago. That might not have 
been a good thing. I- think tonight they 
were able to make die adjustments 
against us," 

IPFW led by as many as sbt late

Another step forward 



By Dan Vance 

dan.vanceeipfwcomniunlcatDr.org 

Throughout the years. Dane 
Fife has been very dear that 
his team is making progress 
towards the ultimate goal of 
being a consistent conference 
contender. 

This year was another step 
fonvard in that evolution as 
the Mastodons picked up big 
conference wins late and even 
knocked off usual Summit 
power Oral Roberts, 

"I think we've established 
IPFW as a team, as a respectful 
program; it'snotadoormai. Now 
we have to continue to build a 
championship contender," Fife 
said. "We know the odds are 
against us, but with that said, 
we have a job to do and we are 
going to do it to the best of our 
ability." 

The team will only be 
replacing David Carson and 
lakari Johnson. The duo played 
a total of six seasons with the 
Mastodons, each leaving an 
important mark. 

"Dave and Jakari brought a 
solid leadership that is going to 
be tough to replace and that's 
where you have to have guys 
like (Deilvez) Yearby and (Zach) 
Plackemeier and (Nick) Daniels 
who understand and will put in 
the work," Fife said. 

Yearby and Daniels wil] 
headline another small senior 
class next year with Aaron 
Richie, who played limited 
minutes later in the season. 

Plackemeier and Ben Botts 
already came into this past 
season as the most tenured 
Mastodons, despite their 
sophomore status. Bods has 
averaged around 30 minutes 
per contest both seasons 
while Plackemeier's time and 
productivity nearly doubled 
from 16 to 32 minutes and 4.1 
to 7.7 points from 2007-2008 to 
2008-2009. 

Freshmen John Peckinpaugh 
and Trey McCorlde join those 
core five players as the only 
other strongly experienced 
players on the roster. 

Fife plans to make some 
changes to next year's non-

conference schedule. This 
season, IPFW played and lost to 
four current NCAA participanis 
and Nebraska, who will play in 
thepostseasonNlTToumament, 
also starting this week. 

"I think we have to have 
a few of those games, I think 
we have way too many," Fife

noted. "You'd like to come 
into conference play with no 
worse than an 8-3 record and 
the games that we have to play 
makes it very difficuh to do so." 
IPFW was 5-6 in non-Summit 
League play in 2008, including 
wins over Valparaiso, Eastern 
Illinois and lU-East. 



Summit League result 
dissapoints but may 
offer best opportunity 



In All Directions 

By Dan Vance 

vance-iad.blogspoT.com 



For more In All Directions' t^ke 
on the men's NCAA Tournament 
and why they thould switch to 
a 128-team (ormat, check out 
vance-iad.blog spot.com 



Let me first say that 1 am not happy with the 
outcome of the Summit League tournament title 
game. I have never been a fan of North Dakota State 
and never even pretended to like conference Player 
of the Year Ben Woodside, 

On the other end of the spectrum, you could call 
me somewhat of an Oakland fan (I know Dane, you 
don't have to say anything.) 

I think Oakland was the perfect team when 
il comes to the conference. They have a terrific, 
experienced coach in Greg Kampe, a stellar quick 
point man in Jonathan lones. a lights out shooter in 
Eric Kangas, a high energy pest in Keith Benson and 
the intangible guy in Will Hudson. Around ALLof that, 
they also have stellar freshman Drew Maynard and 
a defensive juggernaut in frosh Blake Cushingberry. 
Not to mention senior Dan Waterstradt, who was out 
of this world in the opening round against IPFW, 

That to me is the perfect prolot^Tie for a Mid-Major 
and 1, as a fan of basketball, 
would have been proud to 
have that team represent 
the Summit League in this 
year's field of 65. But I also 
know the conference's 
best chance at &lt;.vinning a 
tournament game comes 
intheformofNDSU. 

This Bison team is everything that Cinderella could 
hope to be. They are from a smaller conference, in 
their first full year of NCAA Division I eligibility. But 
at thesame, with a record of 26-5, they are not exactly 
too far off the radar. After winning the conference 
tournament, NDSU had a chance to win a game in 
this year's NCAA Tournament. 

That is something that neither Oakland or even 
defending league champion Oral Roberts would do. 

So I feel bad for Oakland, but know that sans- 
Kangas and Waterstradt, they will all be back to power 
through the conference next year. Not to mention, 
their best player Derrick Nelson didn't even play this 
year. 

And for NDSU, they may not be the team ] wanted 
toseeadvance, but they are theSummit'sbest chance. 
Even before the field of 65 was announced this past 
Simday. people all around coUege basketball were 
calling on the Bison to be the potential upset special 
this post-season. That seemed to die down some 
when they drew defending National Champions 
Kansas. 

But 1 don't see why. 

Kansas as an opponent does not change all of the 
good things that NDSU brings to the table and to me, 
they will still be the 'Cinderella' team when all is said 
and done. More importantly, even a single win by 
them will given instant credibility to the league. 

Hope the Bison don't let down. 



Fife hopes that Mines, other potential recruits will fill voids 



As the postseason recruiting process gets into full 
swing, IPFW coach Dane Fife is ready to fill any holes 
in his lineup. 

"I think we need some bulk, especially to replace 
Dave (Carson), someone who can guard the three or 
four or even five," Fife said. 

Some of that interior assistance virill come from 
6'8" Mario Hines, who committed on September 30 
of last year. 

Hines, a forward out of Garfield Heights High 
School in Cleveland, Ohio is considered a two-star 
recruit by scout.com and could be a strong inside 
svring player in the form of junior Deilvez Yearby with 
dme and weight added lo his 215 pound frame, 

"He is athletic and has some skill," Fife said. "He's 
not going to come in and be an all-league player to 



start with. Mario's going to take some time to develop 
but he'll get it done in the meantime." 

Fife is also hoping to add another solid player 
at the shooting guard or small for^vard position fo 
furthur depth. 

"We need a bigger wing, Frank Gaines is only 6'2". 
We need a wing about 6'5" that can guard some of 
the bigger wings in our league," Fife said. 

Gaines, a redshirt this season, will have four full 
years of eligibility left and is expected to add a good 
deal of energy and athleticism. He averaged 16.7 
points and seven rebounds as a high school senior.

West Coast brings mixed results 

■ IPFW hosts and defeats Pacific on back-to-back nights, falls twice in California 



By Monica Gerdeman 

nic3.gerdcinJndipfwcommunlcatar.org 



Both Friday and Saturday 
before everyone took off for spring 
break, the men's volleyball team 
kicked off the University of the 
Pacific's break with two notches 
on the loss side, both matches 
ending 3-1 in IPFW's favor. As 
most of the people were heading 
somewhere warm, the Tigers of 
Stockton, California traded their 
climate for an overall chilled 
smackdoivn by the Mastodons, 
On Friday night, the 'Dons got 
off to a slow start losing the first 
game, but completed tlie win in 
four. Sophomore Darryl Shank led 
the team in kills with 19, closely 
followed by Ben Duckworth with 
14 and Oliver Kook with 10. 

Mo\'ing into Saturday, the 
ending of the first game came and 
went as game point was undecided 
for three volleys until IPFW finally 
put it away with a kill by Shank. 
Starting libero Mike Morici saw 
a substantial amount of playing 
time during both matches with 
Pacific with eight digs Friday and 
leading the team with 13 
on Saturday. The second 
match started with 
much more spark, as the 
Mastodons held a solid 
lead after hitting double 
_ digits. As the third game 
started, IPFW realized that 
maybe a break between 
games wasn't the best, 
because the Tigers came 
out with their game faces 
on, giving the Mastodons 
a run for their money. 
The game went back and 
forth until IPFW had an 
eight point freeze on 15. 
By the time they were 
able to score again, the 
Tigers already had a five 
point lead, and the 'Dons 



fizzled from there, leaving the final 
score 22-30. 

Finally in the fourth, on an 
IPFW match point witli service 
by Pacific's leff Hendershot, a 
Dan Mader assist (career high 50 
assists) and a put down by Danyl 
Shank (22 kills) ended the game. 

Setter Corey Stewart was still 
unable to play against Pacific on 
account of his index finger injury, 
but saw a set and a half worth 
of playing time in Active Ankle 
Classic tlie following weekend. 

Assistant Coach Ryan Perrotte 
noted that Stewart's injury is 
slowly progressing, and they are 
not trying to rush him back into 
the game. 

I PFWresumed on the hardwood 
this past Friday and Saturday in the 
Active Ankle Classic hosted byLong 
Beach Slate University'. The 'Dons 
first matched up with Long Beach 
State and were unable to make 
things work as their lead attacker. 
Shank, was only able to contribute 
three kills. Long Beach was able to 
control their opponents with their 
net-game. They used a two and 
sometimes three-man blocking 
technique which made it hard for 



a good spike to hit the fioor. Match 
two was also a tough loss. IPFW 
took on Brigham Young University 
and once again the attacks where 
what hurt the 'Dons. Comparing 
kills. BYU had succeeded with 48 
and IPFW had only 28. 

The tournamenE has always 
been one filled with ranked teams, 
and this year was a rough one for 
the Mastodons. When asked why 
the west coast, Perrotlc said, "The 
only way you can gel belter is by 
playing better competition." 

He also 
commented 
on having a 
young team, 
and wanting 
to improve 
and build on 
that. 

IPFW is back in action tins 
weekend on die road at Penn Silkc 
Friday and St. Francis Saturday. 

"The first match up ivith Penn 
State was very competitive, and 
if we learn to focus on our side 
of the net, on our skill and effort, 
the only thing we can ask for is a 
performance like the last time," 
Perrotte said.

Softball splits league opener in Louisiana 

■ Delayed start at Centenary comes after 4-6 start for team at annual Rebel Games 



The IPFW Mastodons split their 
Summit League-opening series 
with Centenary, with the Ladies 
taking the first game8-0, and IPFW 
winning the nightcap 5-1. 

In the first game, the "Dons 
struggled lo put a bat on the ball, 
as Centenary' (17-9, 1-1 Summit 
League] scored a run in both the 
second and third innings. Three 
more Lady runs pushed the hosts' 
lead to 5-0 after the fourth inning. 

The only Mastodon to reach 
base in the game happened in 
the top of the fifth inning when 
freshman Cassie Wolfe hit a hard 
grounder to Centenary shorlslop 
Emerald Doria's side, and her olT- 
balanced throw was unable Co be 
corralled by first baseman Allison 
McClain. The play was initially 
ruled a hit, snapping the no-hit 
bid; however, was later changed 
10 an error on the first baseman by 
the official scorer, keeping pitcher 
Jessica Dock's no-hitter intact, 



in which she would keep for the 
game, as Centenary' added diree 
more runs in the bottom of the 
fifth, lo give the hosts ihe eight- 
run, five-inning victor^'. 

The second game looked to be 
a continuation of the first, as the 
Ladies put a run across the plate 
in the bottom of the first inning on 
a leadoff home run, however, that 
would be the final run the Ladies 
would score in the contest. 

IPFW's (5-7. 1-1 Summit 
League) offense awoke in the 
tliird inning, when Kylee Faurole 
grounded out to Ihe shortstop 
with the bases loaded, knotting 
the game at one apiece, before 
pitcher Rachel Slaschuk doubled 
lo left field, scoring Heather 
Genovese. Wolfe followed with a 
sacrifice fly to center field, scoring 
Kaitlyn Frost, setting ihe table 
for Kristina Karpun. who put the 
finishing touches on the frame 
with a double down the left field 



line, scoring Slaschuk. 

The game's final run came in 
the top of ihe sixth inning when 
Beatrice Pedraza doubled to open 
the frame, and then advanced 
to third on a passed ball. Darby 
Pearson then hit into a fielder's 
choice, scoring the Dons only 
senior. 

Rachel Staschuk pitched the 
entire seven innings, scailering 
eight hits and allowing the lone 
run in ihe first inning. She struck 
out tivo, while also walking a pair. 

Each of IPFW's six hits came 
from different baiters, as Faurole. 
Slaschuk, Wolfe, and Karpun each 
had a hit and RBI, while Genovese 
had a hit and a run. 

Previous to the games, ihe 
team played in Kissimmee. Florida 
at the Rebel Games. They opened 
the irip with a win over Fairfield 
during the 4-6 Florida trip. Other 
wins were over Eastern Kentucky 
and two over Voungs town Stale.
