Coufoudakis directs center 



Evangelos I Van) Coufoudakis, 
associate professor of political science 
at IPnV, has been appointed director 
of the I.U. Center tor Global Studies. 

"All ot us need to become more in- 
formed about global affairs. While we 
are training to be experts In particular 
areas ue need lo imdersland how the 
decisions made abroad affect us in our 
daily lives," Coufoudakis said, ex- 
plaining the Center's general mission of 
promoting inlerdisciplinary study at 
global affairs. 

The Center has three main objectives 
that are primarily concerned with 
curriculum development and in 
con:miunily and campus discussions ot 
majorissuesinBlobalaffalrs. 

"On any campus, including our^, 
there is a tendency to teach in our 
specialized areas and ignore those ot 
others. We forget that iie have others 
throughout the university, both In other 
disciplines and on other campuses, who 
specialize in areas we need to in- 
corporate into our leaching." he said. 
He added, for eiamplc. that a class in 
U S History woidd find it profitable to 
be given an understanding of what was 
happening in Europe at the same time, 
or an art class might need an un- 
derstanding of economics or business at 
a given pcnod 



S Ire ng then ing the graduate and 
undergraduate curriculum by en- 
couraging the inclusion ot glotul 
perspectives into core courses and 
developing new courses is at the heart 
of the program. Conducting faculty 

disciplinary cooperation among faculty 
and acquiring library resources are 
among Ihe primary alms of these ot&gt;- 
]eclives. 

Strengthening the education 
programs for mulli ■national firms and 
programs for training executives tor 
international organizations and 
overseas offices of American agencies 
are several of the further reaching 
aspects of the program. Creating case 
materials tor existing core coursts in 
management education will help add 
this global dimension. 

"We need to go out into the com- 
munity and we need to bring business 
and community leaders to campus. AL 
of us — facully, students and business 
and community leaders — need to 
share our information, ideas and 
views," he said, emphasizing the idea 
that global studies are broader than 
simply lapping academic resources. 

Thlsslatemenlalsolndicates, inpart, 
the larger scope of the third main ob- 



Jccllve — gelling the knowledge Into the 
handsoflhosewhocanuBelt, ' i ,- 

Providingconsultanlservic«slo state 
deparlments ot public inslruction, 
business, labor, churches, medio and 
civic organizations is Just part of the 
objective. 

The provision of services on behalf of 
global studies lo schools including other 
colleges and universities in the state 
and region is a vital pari of Ihe 
program. Establishing a speaker's 
bureau and preparing and distributing 
publicallons are pari of ihe plan for 
implementing this. 

Coufoudakis enplalned that the 
center urges members ofthc university 
community lo use lis assistance In 
incorporating global perspectives Into 
more specialiied teaching area. Those 
inlcresled in any aspecl of Iheprogram 
are encouraged to contact Evangelos 
Coufoudakis through the IPFW 
DepartmenlofPollticalScience, 

"Professor Coufoudakis Is well 
known as an innovator and expert In the 
area of inlemational studies, lamqulle 
pleased that his fine reputation helped 
bring this prestigious center to our 
campus for administration." said

Enrollment 
gains made 
on campus 

ByWAV.SESTEFFEN 

Ma lug log Editor 

The growing prestige of Ihe Fort 
Wayne campus is viewed by Phillip 
Kennel, director ot admissions, as a 
major reason lor IPFW's continued 
enrollment growth, 

"The office ot University Relations, 
Chancellor Giusli, and the vice- 
chancellor have all put a priority on 
letting people know who we are," 
Kennel sold. 

Word of moulh is also Important, 
Kennel said. "One sludenl will tell hU 
friends that he was satisfied here." 

According to Kennel, the economy 
has not been such a factor this year as 
In the past "People believe that things 
are picking up, so the student who 
wants to go lo a residential college can 
get the money logelher to go," Kennel 

Kennel views being a commuler 
campis as being an advantage. "Here 
you can work at the same lime and ooly 



y ford 






s as you lake them," he

Commuter colleges also attract older 
students, he said. "I feel that the 
younger students benefit from having 
an older person in class ~ someone wbo 
has ban dowa the pike." Kennel said. 

The older, "non-tradiUonal sttxlenl" 
is a target groiqi for Kennel. "We go U&gt; 
indictry as w ell as to high schools to tell 
oorslory." Kernel said 

With new degree programs, such as 
theengineering courses, and currimlar 
changes being implemented. Kernel 
said IPFW can do more than hold its 
own agahut projected high school

from its single- building infancy in 
10G9 when Ihe Fcrt Wayne extensions of 
Indiana and Purdue universities 
mtTged. IPFW is enjoying an ali-lime 
high fall enrollment of more than 10.000 
Tut! and p&lt;)rl-tirnc students. 

Two new buildings will open on 
campus during Che courae of IhLs 
nemeslcr, and many new courses and 
even new degree programs are being 
offered lo IPFW students. 

What has prompted IPFW's 
phenomenal growth? 

Some experts claim a slow economy 
always brings about a return of students 
lo the classrooms. Others claim that 
today's youth have higher career goals 
that demand a college education. 

Still others beliewc that society has 
pressured students into gelling a college 
education so that they "don't have (ojId 
h.ird physical work like their parents 



have had to do " 
Any one or all of these reasons may be 

But Ihe question remains— why have 
students chosen 1PFW7 

Could it be thai IPFW is gaining 
respect as a complete university? Could 
H be that IPFW is no longer thought of as 
"Bypass U, the place you go when you 
can't afford lo go 'on campus'?" 

Could it be that ihe image of IPFW is 
no longer that of an '■extension facility" 
of ils mother universities, Indiana and 
Purdue? 

Yes. IPFW's adolescent years are 
coming to a close, and the university is 
coming closer to malurily. 

A continued emphasis by the ad- 
ministration on quality faculty members 
presenting a quality education in a 
quality environment will surely bring 
aboul IPI^Vs adulthood, 

Ves, IPFW Is coming of age.

When their alarms ring

American workers routinely 

drag themselves from bed. 
and prepare for eight houn

activity thai sceou so 
natural that few workers 
bother loanalyie it. 

Working seems simply to 
be a necessary part of life,

do might appear port of the 
natural order of things 
Historically, middle-class 
sons went lo college and 
pursued professional or 
managerial careers, while 
ihelr sistets stayed home 
and reared children, or 
worked DS secretaries or

sons and daughters followed 
their parents Into factories

that could occur only In a 
pluralistic, democratic, 
affluent, capitalist society. It 
Is a rei'olution whose only

demand for greater choice. 
American workers may

arc clear about what they do

Christopher Rccvo'a 
(ormance. He has (un 
Ihe Supers 
without mnking tun o( : 



of ihc characters and 
provides no character 
development The (ilm 
movo from one hair-raising 
escape lo another, u'ith 
nolhing else tu hold the film 
together. 

"Clash Of The Titans" is 
an enjoyable retelling of the 
myth A distinguished cast 
and sufwrb special effects by 
Ray HarryhOkEen bring 
more deplh to this nim than 

'Dragonslaycr" is one of 
the few lanlasy films Ihis 
summer that has bolh 
churacler development and 
style Filmmakers Hal 
Barnood and Mathew 
Bobbins have created 
breathtaking special e (feels, 
and good pcriormances from 
Peter Macnicbol. Cat I In 
Clarke and Ralph Richard- 
son provide Inlercsling 
characierdevclopmenl. 

"The Fox and Ihe Hound" 
is un cf[ecllvc, well done 
"afllTriBted — fflfn ~ wllh 
sequences as brilliant as any 
in Disney's onimaled films 
oflhcM's. 

"Heavy Metal" is 
animallon ola different sort 
II successlully captures a 
satiric, violent tone with 
good animation and o hard 
rock soundtrack, and will 
undoubtedly be a hit on the 
midnight show circuit. 

"For Your Eyes Only" is 
one o( the belter Bond films, 
containing the most exciting 
Bond chase sequences ever 
filmed. II is not as saline or 



Moore Bond Tilms. 



Ihc 30's Unfortunately, the 
film bogs down when it tries 
to beserious, and although It 
has many wllty lines, it tacks 
the fast paced zanlness o( 
other films of Ihis type. 

■'History Of TTie World 
Part I" is Mel Brooks' u-orst 
film to dale. II combines 
tasteless sight gags with 
toilet humor to make it an 
offense to almost anyone. 

'■Slripes" is an en- 
tertaining Bill Murray 
vehicle that gets lost in its 
second half. Like "Pnvaic 
Elenjamln" in many ways, 11 
couches Its message In many 
hilarious sequences 

"Blow Out" Is a romantic 
thriller. Director Brian 
OcPalma Is not out for blood 
and guts this lime, but 
crafted a remarkably 
restrained character study 
of a man unwittingly witness 
to a murder John Travolta 
gives his best performance 

"Endless Love" is belter 
than we have been led lo 
believe. Even with Ihe 
mclodramalle lapses that 
occur In the second half, the 
film avoids cliches and 
develops its character in a 
subdued manner. Brooke 
Shields IS more effective 
than she has teen in the past, 
but the lllm works because of 
the performances of Shirley 
Knlghl and Martin Heweil. 
who manage to bring depth 
to roles that could be trite. 

"Wolfen" is an offbeal 
thriller that never gol (he 
wide release It deserved. It 
keeps you on the edge of your 

slcadicam photography and
