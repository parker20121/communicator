IPFW'S proposed science building 
makes Indiana's top ten list 



By S. Brant Kelley 
News Writer 

Despite a tight budget for 
IPFW's 1994-95 school year, the 
proposed science building is not 
a likely casualty, according to 
Vice Chancellor of Financial 
Affairs Walt Branson. 

Branson talked about IPFW's 



budget for Ihe 1994-95 school 
year during the IPSGA meeting 
on Oct. 24. 

Enrollment for this year was 
0.8 percent below projections. 
Branson said. The budget was 
projected for about 101,500 
credit hours to attend IPFW this 
year, but only 100,735 were 
enrolled. "Something needs cut- 



ting back to balance this year's 
budget," Branson said. 

Next year's budget increase 
will be split evenly between stu- 
dents and the slate, according to 
Branson. Tuition and fees will 
increase by four percent and 
state funding will also increase 
by four percent. He also said 
IPFW made a request for 



$545,000 for quality improve- 
menL 

A student asked Branson what 
the status of the science building 
was. and he said he was "very 
optimistic" about it. Indiana 
makes a priority list for new 
expenses each year, and the sci- 
ence building was number nine 
on the list, according lo Branson. 



He said the state has about $150 
million allocated for the lop ten 
budget items on the lisL 

Branson said the science 
building should be close lo other 
academic facilities, specifically 
Keitler Hall and Classroom 
Medical. He said the science 
building would be close lo other 
academic buildings because it 



would contain animal care facili- 
ties. 

Branson said talking lo local 
legislators, such as stale sena- 
tors, is the best way to influence 
IPFW's funding. Slate politicians 
want input from their con- 
stituents and will listen lo them, 
he said. 



lU trustees 
conduct business 
at IPFW campus 



byNolT. Becklcy 
StflfT Writer 

The JU Board of Trusiees dis- 
cussed revamping Ihe cuncnl reword 
system for icachcrs and professors 
during Ihcir business meeting at 
IPFWonOci.27. 

'The current reward syslcm favors 
research. 'said Myles Brand. lU 
President. 

Trustee Fred Eichorn said. "At 
promotion and tenure lime we would 
like lo evaluate faculty members as 
leacbera." 

Eicbbom cilcd Russell Egarlon of 
the American Association of Higher 
Education wtio researched "The 
National Perspective on Peer Review 
of Teachers." 

Also mentioned was lUPUl's Peer 
Review Project which discussed ways 
to communicate effective teaching 
techniques. 

On Oct. 14, lU faculty member 
Barbara Cambridc held a university 
wide conference at Bloominglon 
which also discussed new ways of 
evaluating teachers at tenure time. 

Another major item discussed 
were Ihe changes made lo handle 
problems between the university and 
stale and federal government. 

One change mentioned was crcal- 
ing a special assistant who reports 
directly to ihc president on state and 



federal matters. 

According to the "Review of 
Government Relations Activities of 
Indiana University" researched by 
Richard L. Kennedy, vice president 
for Govemmeni Relations and secre- 
tary (rclired) at Ihc University of 
Micliigan, "At Ihe slate level there is 
some confusion over what are the 
funding priorities of lU." 

Kennedy recommended that 
"University representatives at bolh 
Ihe siaic and federal level be included 
as full panicipants in the process. ..the 
University employs lo determine iis 
priorities.. .for state and federal gov- 



Kennedy also noted "Ihe feeling 
on part of some of the regional cam- 
puses tliai their needs are., .ignored in 

Ihe university's budget prioritizing 

To combat this feeling, Kennedy 

suggested coordinating activities of 
the state relations officer and regional 
campus community relations officers 
so there can be a unified approach lo 
local and state legislators. 

The Board of Trustees approved a 
S6 million indoor foolball practice 
facility. The facility would have 
space for soccer, baseball, soflball. 
and golf. 

The facility will be named after its 
biggest conlribulor, John 
Mellencamp.

Walb Union 

expansion 

committee 

formed 



By S. Brant Keliey 
News Editor 

IPSGA invited Vice 
Chancellors Frank Borelli, 
Walter Branson and Fred 
Kirchhoff 10 the IPSGA business 
meeting on Oct. 24 to discuss 
issues of student concern. 

The formation of the Walb 
Expansion Committee was 
announced ai the business meet- 
ing, and several sludenis asked 
about the direction of Walb 
Memorial Union expansion. Vice 
President of Student Activities 
Elaine Lindcr is the chair of the 
commillcc. 

Borelli said he was inlercslcd 
in hearing ideas for the expan- 
sion of Walb Union. He also said 
he feels die addition is needed. 

Borelli said child care facili- 
ties are on the list of possibilities 
for including in expansion plans. 
Kirchoff said, "Space is al a pre- 
mium," and added there was no 
room lo put child care facilities 
in Walb Union al die presenL 

Borelli said he hopes a plan- 
ning committee could be put 
together by ihe end of this year, 
but at least it will be formed by 
the beginning of the fall semes- 
ter 

He said it is too early lo deter- 
mine what exactly will happen 
with student suggestions, when 
expansion will start or how 
much money would be spent, 
"This is just in the idea stage." 
he said. 

One student asked if IPFW 
would be willing to take a small- 
er percentage of food profits 
from The Fort if it meant 
improvements could be made to 
ihe cafeteria food service. 
Branson replied that IPFW is 
interested in inaeasing die food 
volume sold. The students pre- 
sent said diey were interested in 
higher quality radier than lower 
prices. 

Another student said he want- 
ed an ice rink in the expanded 
Walb. Borelli responded, howev- 
er, ihat any ice rink would be 
installed across ihe river. The 
same student also said be wants 
a radio station on campus.

Thureday. November 3. 1994 




Staff Editorial 



; On Saturday. Oct. 22, Fori Wayne 
celebrated its 200ih bicentennial. For 
this celebration, we rejoiced and 
. showed great cheer in a land that was 
stolen from Native Americans, 

We praised General "Mad" 
Anthony Wayne for establishing a 
fort here, and even included his 
name in our city's name. 

Have we forgotten that Native 
Americans use a lo occupy this very 
land? Have we also selectively cho- 
sen 10 forget thai the Native 
Americans did not leave willingly? 
What are we really celebrating? 

Anthony Wayne not only look a 
people's land away but also brought 
death lo a people and destruction lo a 
culture, and, for that, we threw a 
party. 

Why is thai when Americans 
remember history il always appears 
as though it was drawn out of a 
Disney movie? There is a big differ- 
ence between reality and fantasy. In 
reality, it is not only a disgrace but a 
slap in the face 10 the oiiginal inhabi- 



tants of this land that we have spent 
the last year celebrating their demise. 

Some people might suggest that 
this is the past and not imponant, bul 
the fact thai these people were 
robbed of their land is not something 
that can be conveniently ignored. 

It appears as if those attending the 

"As a nation, a city and a 
society. Americans celebrate 
the most ridiculous things. We 

celebrate the birthdays of 

George Washington and other 

founding fathers who just 

happened to own other 

humans." 

bicentennial celebration 3i the 
Embassy put away their consciences 
and pretended as if genocide and 
depraved destruction were things in 
which this city could lake pride. 

As a nation, a city and a society, 
Americans celebrate the most ridicu- 
lous things. We celebrate the birth- 



days of George Washington and 
other founding fathers who just hap- 
pened to own other humans. Thomas 
Jefferson, a man who wrote a criti- 
cism of slavery, at the same time was 
a man who fathered African children 
and owned other Africans. 

This owning of others is seen as 
"popular during this time." Are we 
suggesting that just because some- 
thing occurs during a certain period 
in history that it is then justified and 
rationalized as being normal and 
right and good? 

These facts always appear to be 
deleted from our history books, and 
when we celebrate these persons 
their behavior is always politely for- 
gotten. 

Appaiendy. the revenue the cele- 
bration generated wa.s too imponant 
10 allow a little white guilt to stop 
the revelling. But just as this city 
was established at a horrific cost, so 
the money our city made on the 
bicentennial was eitacied at a price: 
the price of our own integrity.

Writer cautions students 
body presidents actions 



To the editor, 

It is not very often that I 
become embroiled in a political 
debate to the point that I feel 
obligated lo comment, but the 
issue of the abortion advertising 
in The Communicator and the 
stance Mark King, student body 
president, has taken on behalf on 
one lone student has prompted 
me to reply. 

In the first place, I was only 
made aware of this debate 
because I was asked to make a 
public statement expressing the 
views of the Center for Women 
and Returning Adults regarding 
the ad. This particular ad. which I 
cannot say that I fiad even noticed 
to this point (although I read The 
Communicator on a fairly regular 
basis), offers "pregnancy termina- 
lion to 12 weeks'' by "licensed 
gynecologists." King, apparently, 
has embarked oil a campaign to 
have the ad removed from the 
paper indefinitely. The 
Communicator has, of course, 
taken issue with this campaign. 

After reviewing the ad and 
being appraised of the details of 
the clash between The 
Communicator and King, I decid- 
ed to air my views. In no way do 
my opinions reflect those of the 
Center. Instead. I speak only as a 
student when I express my dis- 
may at the manner in which King 
has addressed Uiis issue. 

I have a hard time with many 
advertisements, publications and 
propaganda. I cringe at the ram- 
pant displays of pornographic 
material (in every medium avail- 
able, including Internet) and the 
hawkings of lawyers who 
promise lo "get you off the hook" 
when one is slapped with multi- 
ple DUI's. In an age when Neo- 



Nazism and Ku Klu'^ Klan are 
alive and well, lack of control is 
definitely a scary prospect. 
However. I feel that the alterna- 
tive is perhaps more dangerous. 
As a country, we need to decide 
just how far the "long arm" of 
paternalism should reach. 

Abortion is still legal in 



"I believe that the more 

wise and introspective 

approach to dealing with 

censorship of an 

advertisement in the 

student paper would 

involve polling the 

student body and inviting 

comment and response 

from more than one 

student." 



America. Abortion clinics, 
should, therefore, as paying cus- 
tomers and as institutions operat- 
ing under full legal auspices, 
allowed to advertise their services 
in whatever publication they 
choose. 

Personally, 1 don't agree widi 
every viewpoint that is expressed 
in The Communicator, either — 
whether it is in the form of adver- 
tisements, letters to the Editor, 
columns or the "slant" of news 
articles. I had always just 
assumed that my thoughts, alone, 
did not represent those of an 
entire student body. I also 
assumed that if I took issue with a 
certain piece of writing, I could 
simply choose to disregard it. 
Further still, 1 could respond to 



the article in writing, or I could 
even decide to fling the paper 
into the nearest dumpsier and for- 
get the whole thing. 

I am NOT taking sides on the 
abortion issue. I refuse to be 
pulled into that argument. Like 
many of us. I feel that my 
thoughts on the issue are com- 
plex, lingering more in the "gray" 
than in the "black and white." 
However, 1 do feel that is impor- 
tant that those in positions of 
power (relatively speaking, of 
course) be careful when embark- 
ing upon courses of action that 
are assumed to be representative 
of a group. And Mark King is 
representative of a group — the 
students of IPFW from which in 
fact, he has gleaned his represen- 
tative power. It is with the title 
"Student Body President" that he 
argues his point. In this case, I 
believe that the more wise and 
introspective approach to dealing 
with censorship of an advertise- 
ment in the student paper would 
involve polling the student body 
and inviting comment and 
response from more than one stu- 
dent. Then, anil only then, when a 
spokesperson is sure that he or 
she is backed by a majority. 
should he or she investigate pos- 
sible courses of action. This, loo, 
is assuming that student govem- 
ment has an inherent right to dic- 
tate the policy to the campus 
newspaper. Because 1 am not 
privy to Uie logistics of that argu- 
ment, 1 will not even attempt to 
involve myself in that debate. 

Sincerely, 
Deaiuia K. Gorman 
IPFW 



Reader not interested 
in writers' opinions 



To the editor. 

One of the preoccupying con- 
cerns of those involved in the 
American print media is that of sur- 
vival; Will the newspaper as we 
know it survive an age of television 
and computer on-line services? This 
has many in the industry worried. 
and if The Communicator is repre- 
sentative of what we may expect in 
the future, they should be. The 
paper claims to be the "Second- 
place winner of the 1994 ICPA 
Division II Best Overall Newspaper 
Award." I surmise the first place 
went to the Peddler's Post. I know I 
don't want to see who came in 
third. 

Interestingly, in an editorial 
published Oct. 27, the writer pur- 
ports to be concerned with "journal- 
ism ethics." My eyes then wander 
across the gutter to the next page. lo 
an ad that has been appearing 
almost weekly, the one directed lo 
Mark King, student president: 
"They say it takes a MAN to admit 
that he is wrong. ..yet we still have 



hope for Mark." They say that 
youth is wasted on the young, but 
it's evident that brains aren't. The 
budding Oscar Wilde that penned 
this sparkling bit of repanee hasn't 
let mere "ethics" stand in the way 
of a personal vendetta, no sir. 

While we're on the subject of 
homosexuals, this naturally brings 
us to the occasional contribution of 
one staff writer. Evidently he is 
absolutely convinced that the stu- 
dent body takes an inordinate inter- 
est in his personal life, who is 
spreading rumors about him. and 
who his friends are "daiing," if 
indeed these homosexual liaisons 
can be characterised by such a 
quaint term. The boy is rapidly ges- 
tating into the Louella Parsons of 
the gay community. Let me assure 
him that we are not in the least 
interested. Further, often our objec- 
tions to homosexuality are tooted in 
a complex Ctiristian epistemology, 
and not "fear, stupidity and insecu- 
rity," as your hamfisied editorial 
canoonist has asserted. In a recent 
article, the writer noted with 



approval the statement of one 
homosexual as he was being tested 
for HIV: "If my parmer were diag- 
nosed as infected, it would not 
make any difference." And you 
wonder why we can'i control 
AIDS. 

Often, student contributions are 
as abysmal as the paper. One bap- 
less individual recently whined 
about never knowing that Egypt 
was on the continent of Africa. 
Rather than reach the obvious con- 
clusion, he naturally decided 
instead that this information bad 
been con.spiraiorially withheld from 
him for his entire life. Damnably 
clever, these white people. Feeding 
this mindset have been articles 
claiming that history in general has 
been tailored to deliberately lower 
the "self-esteem" of blacks. If the 
sclf-rigbteous preachiness and ludi- 
crous posturing of some of The 
Communicator staff are any indica- 
tion, a poor self-image is the least 
of their woiries. Once, a native

How Much Do You 
Know About H.E.R.? 



Bringing true self out 



By Paul Tuppcr 
StafT writer 

Coming out as a homosexual is a 
difficult process. 1 hkc lo think that 
there arc three areas of concentration 
when doing so: 1) coming out to 
yourself, 2) coming oui to your 
friends and 3) coming out lo your 
parents. Eacti are difficult in tlielr 
owTi ways, and require different lac- 

Coming out one's self 

After you realize that you arc 

homosexual and cannot do a thing 10 
change it. you have begun the coming 
out process. Society leaches us that 
gays are perverted creatures who God 
hales. If you arc like most others who 
arc just coming to terms with them- 
selves, you probably fee] like you are 
ihc only homosexual in town since 
they only live in San Francisco. 

What you don't know, or may not 
realize, is thai homosexuals arc 
everywhere. Finding them is nol that 
difficult of a task. This campus has a 
gay organization, alicrnativc lifestyle 
student organization (ALSO), that is 



a positive environment for meeting 
other gay people like yourself 

The last place you might want to 
consider going (o for your first gay 
outing is a gay bar. Like ihc straight 
bars, meetings in gay bars rnight be 
driven by ulterior motives other than 
dancing and socializing. 
Coming out to friends 

After coming out to their own per- 
sons, some fear thai ihc friends previ- 
ously made may not accept the gay in 
them. Some people fmd it easier lo 
hide their sexuality than to defend it. 
Soon, your hfc is lived to please your 
friends. You may even dale the oppo- 
site sex just to fool ihcm. You are 
now leading two lives, neither of 
which is a happy one. 

For those who are more comfort- 
able with their sexuality, coming out 
can be done quickly and entirely. But 
for most others, a gradual approach is 
suggested. Start with someone who 
knows you best and just say it, "I'm 
gay!" You may find that those closest 
to you may have already suspected it. 

Entertain any questions ihey may 
have. Talking aboul it gets easier with 



Coming out to family 

Revealing your homosexuality &lt;o 
your family is probably the most deli 
caie stage of coming oui. From con 
ception, parents envision their chil- 
dren maturing to be doctors, lawyers, 
teachers, or even alhletcs or enle 
crs, but never homosexuals. 

One thing not to do is to blurt out 
your sexuality during a defensive 
rage. Coming out to your parents dur- 
ing a heated argument will only cause 
more tension and will not help either 
party. 

Make information available to 
your parents. Give your parents 
research material that will help them 
come 10 terms with your sexuality. 
Any library in town is full of such 
material. 

Remember your intentions- 
Coming out should be done for your 
sake only, do not do ii to please any- 
one odier than yourself. Ask any out 
horrtosexual. and you will find that 
life is so much easier to live outside 
die closet.

In search of the perfect pickle 



Kara Whiling 
Features Editor 
Well my friends, I have decided 
to lake ii upon myself lo find fouall 
of you pickle lovers ihe "perfeci 
pitkle." I personally do not like the 
big juicy things, but I thought it 
ouid be interesting to find oui 
which siorc-boughi pickle was the 
best. This week's ratings will be 
defined by puckers: one pucker is 
terrible; two puckers is not very 
exciting; three puckers is okay, but 
not worth screaming over; four 
puckers will keep you asking for 
more; and, five puckers is purely 



after careful debate on which pickles 
10 lest (there are a lot from which to 
choose). I finally found fout brands 
that looked worthy of testing. They 
are as follows; Aunt Jane's Kosher 
Icebergs; Vlasic Dill Spears; 
Sechler's Swcei Pickle; and, Van 
Mollen Dill Pickles, 

•Aunt Jane's Kosher Icebergs 

First of all, the size of a pickle is 
very important to me, as it should be 
10 everyone. So we measured the 
Auni Jane pickle and found it lo be a 
mere four-and-a-half inches. This 
four-calorie pickle al a cost of S2,69 
was a nice yellowish-green color 
and according to Michelle Tisland, 
The Communicator staff production 
rnanager, "It just slides down my 
throat." 

As for the actual taste, it was tart 
and very crispy and crunchy on the 
outside, but the soft, delicate, lender 
inside made the difference. So the 
Aunt Jane Kosher Iceburg received 
four puckers for an overall rating. 

'Vlasic Dill Spears 

After careful measuring, we 
found the Vlasic to be a whopping 
five whole inches in length, (quite a 
breakthrough as far as pickles go, if 
you ask me). The four-calories

- Photo by Rachel S. Dettmer, Photo Editor 



that cost S2.79 was not worth (he 
S2.79 at all. 

Despite the rubbery, tough skin, 
the pickle itself had no taste at all. 
Unfortunately, for the advertisers at 
the Vlasic Company. I could not 
personally hear the supposed 
"crunch" that we hear on the com- 
mercial. So. the final rating was one 
pucker, because none of us ever 
wanted to eai this pickle again. 
*Secbler's Sweet Pickles 
Oh boy, talk about a small pick- 
le! We could hardly see il! After 
some searching, we found the pickle 
and measured it to be approximately 
two-and-a-haJf inches long. Quite a 
midget compared to the previous 
ones. Tisland even had to comment, 



"These are small." 

And small was not all that they 
were, either. No calorie count was 
given, but the price was S2.09 a jar. 
The "midget" pickle tasted fairly 
sweet and the deep green coloring 
added to the pickle. The pickle was 
CTunchy; you could just chew right 
through it. We gave this pickle three 
puckers for an overall rating. 

•Van Hollen Dill Pickle 

This refrigerated pickle measured 
about four-and-a-half inches long. 
The interesting note about this pick- 
le was not only that the length was 
decent, but the width was nice and 
big, as well, a favorable trail for the 
pickle. 

However, being in the refrigerated 



section at the supermarket, the 
package only contained one fifteen- 
calorie pickle retailing for S.69. 

The actual taste of Ihe pickle was 
a little sour, but the skin was 
remarkably crispy. The flesh was 
nice and juicy, and it went down 
quite smoothly, another favorable 
trait. 

Bui because you only get one in a 
package for S.69, it is not worth the 
price. So, for a final rating, this 
pickle received three puckers. 

In conclusion, the group decided 
that the Aunt Jane Kosher Iceburg 
pickle is worth going oui today anj 
trying, if you haven't already, 
because it kept us asking for more! 



Volunteer Opportunities Offered at IPFW 



Kara Whiting 
Features Editor 

For those of you who find thai 
volunteering is not as fun as il 
sounds, here are some suggestions 
Ihai may catch your eye. 

I received a letter in the mail 
from Global Volunteers, located in 
Si. Paul, Minnesota, ihat gave many 
different lypes of volunteering ideas 
ihnt require both brain and brawn. 

Some of Ihe opportunilies 
offered were: working on a water- 
way system on the Pacific coasi of 
Costa Rica; teaching English at 
Tver University in Tver, Russia; 
tutoring children in the Blue 
Mountains of Jamaica; helping lo 
build homes in Ihe Rio Grande 
Valley; or repairing community 
buildings in Ihe Mississippi Delia. 

"Pasl student volunteers have 
discovered that they can make a 
significanl difference in the liveer, it summarized 
that seat belts could have reduced 
injuries and prevented fatalities in 
78 percent of the 176 MVAs in 
which seal belts were not used. 

Be good to yourself and your 
children. Take a second lo click in, 
and take a moment to teach your 
children. It's ihe quickest, easiest, 
cheapest and most effective money- 
saving strategy there is. 

Buckle up for safely! Buckle up 
for well-being!
