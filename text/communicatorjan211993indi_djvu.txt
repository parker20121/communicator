Campus pro-choice, pro-life groups to gather 



Dy Felicia Deeching 
Editor In Chief 

Twenty years ago, on Jan. 22, 1973, 
Norma McCorvcy, using the pseudo- 
nym of Jane Doc, sued Texas authori- 
ties and won the landmark decision 
legalizing abortion, Roc vs. Wade. It 
SCI off a backlash of conoovcrsy Uiat 
siill polarizes the nation. 

To add more fuel to the fire, in 1987 
McCorvcy admitic that she lied about 
being pregnant as a result of rape. 

On Ihc IPFW campus, activities arc 
planned by both the pro-life group, 
Students for Life, and the pro-choice 
group, F.l.R.E. (Fighting Idcatogies 
Rcsisianl 10 Equality). 

On Friday, F.l.R.E. members arc 
meeting 01 the plaza between Helmke 



Library and Walb Union Building ai 
noon for a public commcmmorativc 
gathering. They have released a 
group slalcmcni: 

"This gathering is in memory of all 
the women who died from illegal 
abortions before Roe vs. Wade, and 
all women who have died from ille- 
gal abortions despite Roe vs. Wade 
because it is not accessible enough, 
and in support of the women who 
now face threats and harassment from 
the anli-choicc forces while exer- 
cising their legal right 10 safe 
abortions." 

"Wc are going 10 be an active voice 
in the pro-choice community as long 
as there is any threat 10 a woman's 
right to control her own body with 
safe, legal, and accessible reproduc- 



tive heal di care." 

On Saturday, Students for Life, the 
campus pro-life organization, is one 
of the co-sponsors of the noon-lime 
March for Life and a I p.m. event 
featuring speaker, Jianna Jcsson, at 
the Scottish Riic Auditorium. 

Jesson, 15 years old, survived being 
clinically aborted by her mother dur- 
ing a third trimester saline abortion. 
A nurse in die clinic took her to the 
hospital where she survived. 

Cunently, Jcsson, who walks with a 
limp and has cerebral palsy as a result 
of the abonion, shares her story fre- 
quently widi groups. 

Emotions run hoi when discussing 
abortion. Both groups on campus call 
themselves "pro-life" and "pro- 
choice," but call the opposing side 



"pro-abortion" and "ami -choice." 

"1 think that ihcrc is an uneasy 
truce between ihc two camps and thai 
most faculty and students feel like 
they arc stirring up a hornet's nest to 
talk about abortion," said Marilyn M. 
Shannon, IPFW instructor in biology. 
"I graduated from an urban campus,, 
the University of Pittsburgh, and it 
seems 10 mc diat die majority of stu- 
dents I see on this campus are conser- 
vative. They have families and many 
arc pro-life," observed Shannon. 

Jeannciic R. Clausen, associate pro- 
fessor of Germanic languages and 
faculiy sponsor of F.l.R.E., holds a 
different viewpoint. 

"I remember very well what it was 
like 10 be pregnant in the 1960's prior 
to Roc vs. Wade," said Clausscn. "I 



don't want my daughter or any odier 
woman to go through what I had to 
go through." 

Chrisiianc 1. Seller, associate pro- 
fessor of Germanic languages, be- 
lieves the pro-life stance is hypocriti- 
cal. She quoted Fayc Waitlcton from 
the "I Dream a World" exhibit at the 
Fort Wayne An Museum: 

"1 know of no women who think it's 
a great idea to have an abortion. ..If 
those who oppose abortion care about 
the living as much as they care about 
those who arc not with us and only 
have die potential for being with us, 
why arc so many nonwhite children 
unadopted? No one is breaking down 
die door to lake them in." 

Amy Ruian, IPFW junior, and pres- 
ident of Students for Life, said, "Over 



28 million babies liavc been killed by 
abortion since 1973. Only iWo per- 
cent of those babies died because of 
the modier's health problems, incest, 
or rape." 

"The other 98 percent were aboricd 
for social reasons," continued Ruian, 
"such as die baby was die svrong sex. 
the mother didn't think she could af- 
ford anodier child, being unmarried, 
or interference with a career or job." 

Rutan, a founder of Students for 
Life, also helped found Teens for Life 
at Elmhurst High School. 

Whatever one's viewpoint, the abor- 
tion issue continues to deeply divide 
Americans in all places, including 
IPFW. 



Volleydons 
win opener 

By Michael Bass 
Sports Editor 

The Volleydons opened the season 
lasi Saturday. Jan. 16, at home 
againsi Ball Stale University. They 
won the match in four games. 

The team won game one 15-10. 
lost game two 15-13, won game 
three 15-12, and won game four 
15-10, 

Game one ihc Volleydons dominat- 
ed, never allowing Bull State to take 
the lead. In game two die Ball Stale 
Cardinals lumcd die momentum and 
played agrcssivcly to win 15-13, 

Game two was occupied by sloppy 
play thai was showcased by 17 ser- 
vice errors totaled by bod) teams. 

Game tlircc started out like game 
iwo and it was 9-4 before die Vol- 
leydons knew what hit them. With 
strong defense the 'Dons were able 
10 nip at Ball State's lead and tied it 
at 9-9. 

After a back and forth battle they 
emerged widi die lead at 13-12, and 
went on to take the game and the 
momentum away from Ball Siaie. 

The Volleydons' momentum car- 
ried them through the fourth game 
and on 10 victory. 

"They didn't serve well and we 
didn't serve well. They didn't pass 
well and we didn't pass well," said 
Coach Arnie Ball on the overall 
game play, "h was a typical opening 
weekend on the year for both 
teams." 




IPFW junior Norman Almodovar goes for the kill. 
Edgington. 



Ball believed the key to the victory 
was that his team played a little 
more consistent dian Ball Stale. 

In game dircc he believes die turn- 
ing point was the defense of his 
team led by junior Nonnan Almod- 

"You win games by blocking balls, 
and by making great defensive plays 
and turning ihem into points." said 
Ball, who believes his team played 
that type of game. 

Senior Quentin Spiegel attributes 
ihe momentum change to the endiu- 
siasm of Senior Chad Blatchley. 
Spiegel summed Blatchleys play by 
saying, "Chad's just 100 percent 
pure adrenalin," 

The victory sends the Volleydons 



10 the ASICS Grand Prix Tourna- 
ment being held in San Diego on 
Feb. 5- 6. 

"Going out dierc (San Diego), we 
gel to play against some great com- 
petition." said senior Lloy Ball, "and 
ihat will make us Iwitcr, by playing 
(dial) better competition." 

Last year the team won three of six 
matches in the ASICS tournament 
and hopes 10 do better ihis year. 

There were 2,334 people on hand 
for Saturday night's game, the sec- 
ond highest attendance rate ever in 
IPFW history. 

The Volleydons will play at the 
Hilliard Gates Sports Center again 
Friday Jan. 22, at 7;30 



Purdue regulates budget 



by Felicia Beeching 
Editor-in-chief 

What is fiscal autonomy? 

The 28 member Community Advi- 
sory Council, which is die appointed 
board that oversees the general wel- 
fare at IPFW, asked the same ques- 
don at a special noon mccdng on 
Jan. 5. 

IPFW faculty and adminisiraUon at 
the meeting included: Chancellor 
Joanne B. Lantz, William G. Freder- 
ick, associate professor of computer 
science and presiding officer of die 
Faculty Senate. Ardiur A. Finco, pro- 
fessor of madicmatics, and speaker of 
die Purdue faculty, Steven Hollander, 
assistant professor of English and 
representative of ihc Fort Wayne fU 
faculty council, and Michael C. 
Downs, associate professor of poUti- 
cal science, and chair of the Senate 
Management Agreement commiiice. 

The IPFW community is seeking 
fiscal autonomy for the campus. 
Prescndy, this university's complete 
budget from the s.aic is a single line 
item of Purdue Wt&amp;i Lafayette's bud- 
get. 

It is also s&gt;'mbolic of the status of 
PFW in Purdue 'seyes, 

"West Lafayette misperceives our 
capabilities and diinks of us as an ex- 
tension," said Hollander. "They treat 
the extension schools with contempt. 



but have forgotten that IPFW is not 
an extension campus. Wc have been 
academically autonomous for 20 
years." 

"Purdue treats IPFW's budgei as an 
arm and then amputates it every 




year," said Downs. 

IPFW is not seeking independence 
from the unique lU-PU partnership 
diat exists here. Ii is seeking to stop 
the micro management approach of 
Purdue. Some have equated fiscal au- 
tonomy widi 'decentralization.' 



Fiscal autonomy is a different issue 
than academic autonomy, which 
IPFW obmincd in 1969 when Ihe uni- 
versity gained accreditation by the 
North Ccnual Association of Col- 
leges and Schools. 

"In fiscal matters, we don't make 
sense," said Finco. "In academic mat- 
ters, the faculty and siudcnis have 
made it work, especially at the under- 
graduate level." 

Finco hopes Purdue will rclcnquish 
fiscal control of IPFW 

Fiscal autonomy would allow IPRV 
10 compose its own unique budget 
and present it dircaly to the Indiana 
Commission for Higher Education 
and the Indiana General Assembly, 
insicad of Wcsi Lafayette. 

One frustrated administrator com- 
pared IPFW's present role in the bud- 
geting process as "a kid hoping for 
Santa to bring him a present." 

This feeling underlies die sentiment 
of almost all die faculty and adminis- 
tration, aldiough some believe a more 
accurate description of Purdue as the 
Grinch radier than Soma Claus seems 
appropriate. 

Marian K. Zimmciman, dean of stu- 
dents, has found diat West Lafayette 
often doesn't understand the unique 
needs of students on this campus, and 
is reluctant 10 approve funding for

Harassment topic of program 



By Laura Lineback 
Chief Reporter 

Sexual harassment and iis relation- 
ship to IPFW and the Fort Wayne 
Community will be die topic for ihe 
Jan. 26 "Kaleidoscope" program at 7 
p.m. in the Classroom Medical Build- 
ing, Room 159. The audience is re- 
quested to be seated by 6:30 p.m. 
."Kaleidoscope." sponsored by the 
Center for Women and Returning 
Adults, die Fon Wayne YWCA, and 
Channel 6. is a television program 
dealing widi issues of die Fon Wayne 
community. 

Linda G. Johnson, director of die 
IPFW Center for Women and Relum- 
ing Adults, staled that the co-spon- 
sors "want to present a forum for as 
many people as possible to Icam and 
share insights about die definition of 
sexual harassment and surrounding 
diematic issues." 

"One of the icasous for die topic for 
this television show is because so 
many people arc confused, angry, bit- 
ter, hostile," Johnson said, "They lack 
awareness and don't know where to 
go. We fell students were telling us 
that dicy needed some kind of an op- 
portunity to come together to talk 
about dus (sexual harassment)." 

Johnson referred to the Center for 
Women and Returning Adults as a 
"safe haven" for people to go and re- 
late any incidents concerning sexual 
har^£Smcnt. Johnson stressed the im- 
ponance of strict confidendaliiy; cas- 
es arc not discussed outside of die 
office. 

"It (die univeraiiy) is a radier closed 
culture. For a long time this issue has 
not been dealt with in an open and 
honest way. Hopefully, die show will 
create awareness." said Johnson. 

"A major part of the "Kaleido- 



scope" program is the definition of 
sexual harassment." said Johnson. 
"As people understand it and are able 
to put words to their own situa- 
tions, they will be able to express 
themselves." 

The show will give advice for deal- 
ing with sexual harassment situations 
that may occur in die workplace now 
or in die future. 

The host for the Jan. 26 program is 
Marie Whitehead, community affairs 
director for the Fort Wayne YWCA. 

Whitehead said diat sexual harass- 
ment is a problem that affects both 
men and women. Her office provides 
information and services lo help peo- 
ple who have been involved in that 
situation. 

One of the YWCA services is a 
Sexual Harassment Survivors Support 
Group, which meets the third Tues- 
day of each mondi at 7 p.m. 

Last fall, the YWCA presented a 
sexual harassment workshop in which 
the problem was defined and steps 
were given when employees are con- 
fronted with the situation. 

Dan Holocher, director of die Met- 
ropolitan Human Relations Commis- 
sion, Fon Wayne, is a participant in 
the January "Kaleidoscope" program. 

The Metropolitan Human Relations 
Commission lakes responsibility for 
the enforcement and education of an- 
ti-discrimination legislation in die 
Fort Wayne area. 

The agency invcsugates complaints 
based on sex. national origin, race, 
color, religion, and disability. Dis- 
crimination may occur in pubUc ac- 
commodadon, education, housing, or 
employment, 

Holocher hopes that the "Kaleido- 
5co;x' program is we 11 -at tended. 

"It is Jwaytoeducaieihepublicre- 
gaiding rights and responsibilities un- 



der die law, and provide an opportu- 
nity to gel Ihc word out (concerning 
legal action and sexual harassment) to 
all, employees and employers," said 
Holocher. 

Since the Clarence Thomas and 
Anita Hill hearings, Holocher has 
seen an increase in the number of 
sexual harassment complaints in his 



professor of organi7.ational leadership 
and supervision, provides a legal 
voice to die upcoming program. 

Richard L. Johnson, associate pro- 
fessor of Germanic languages, and di- 
rector of die peace and conflict siud-' 
ics program, works as a counselor at 
the Center for Nonviolence. 

The Center deals with a wide spec- 
trum of cases involving sexual abuse; 
notably, young males who have been 
molested. 

Sexual harassment directed from a 
woman loward a man has occurred in 
situations when die man has a subor- 
dinate position, whether in an em- 
ployment or school setting. 

"Overwhelmingly, the victims (of 
sexual harassment) arc women," said 
Johnson. "Generally, when a man is 
crossing the line (between friendly ui- 
tcntions and hara.ssmcni), women un- 
derstand it belter." 

Linda Johnson has been approached 
by men who have experienced sexual 
harassment. She believes die problem 
for men is deeper than commonly 
dioughi. 

Linda Johnson notes diai IPFW of- 
fers several recourses for victims of 
sexual harassment including the Cen- 
ter for Women and Returning Adults, 
the Affirmative Action office, the 
dean of students, and specially 
trained staff available to students, fac- 
ulty, and staff.

The IPFW Wriiing Center opens 
this semester for any student who 
wants to talk about his or her wridng 
widi an informed reader and listener. 
Located in the basement of Keitler 
Hall, Room G35, ihc Center is open 
Monday- Thursday from noon- 3 
p.m.; Friday from 10 a.m.- 2 p.m.; 
Wednesday and Thursday evenings 
from 7- 9 p.m.; and Sunday from 1- 4 
p.m. 

The Writing Center provides stu- 
dents with strategics, principles, and 
approaches that can be used in any 
writing situation, whedicr acadetruc. 
professional, or personal. 

"The Cenier is primarily for devel- 
oping and improving writers, not Just 
individual papers or assignments," 
said Carol A. Roberts. Director of die 
Writing Center, and IPFW insiracior 
in English and Linguisiics 



"Wc want to influence the writing 
process in order to help the student 
become a better writer and an inde- 
pendent Icamcr." Roberts added. 

The Writing Center staff, all IPFW 
students, were chosen by Roberts 
through an interview process. Each 
potential tutor submitted recommcn- 
dauons by two professors; earned A's 
or B'.s in writing courses at the 2tX) 
level or above; and possessed exten- 
sive writing experience. 

Prior to working in the Center, tu- 
tors learn about the concept of a w/rit- 
ing center and attend training work- 
shops. They acquire skills 10 talk to 
students regarding their writing, 
strategies to help students write clear- 
er, and ways to work with students 
for whom English is a second lan- 
guage. 

The instruction diat students receive 
will be intensive, according lo 
Roberts. She hopes to sec mentoring 
relationships build between tutors and 



students, so diat the students return to 
die Writing Center, 

To receive help at the Writing Cen- 
ter, students must bring the written 
assignment from the teacher, any 
handouts or notes n;lcvant to die as- 
signment, written work that has been 
done dius far on the writing project, 
and a copy of die syllabus. This aids 
the tutor in understanding the stu- 
dent's wriiing task. 

"Students come to us for help dur- 
ing some point in the wriiing 
process," Roberts explained. "We be- 
gin by finding that [poinij. and re- 
spond accordingly — remembering 
thai our best tutoring session will en- 
courage the writer to engage in or re- 
flect on composing." 

Roberts encourages students to 
make 1/2 hour appointments with tu- 
tors during die early phases of an as- 
signment, aldiough help is available 
at any stage. An appointment sheet is 
posted outside the Writing Center.

STAFF EDITORIAL 

IPFW campus lacks 
multicultural climate 




The cultural make-up of a 
university should reflect ihe 
community il serves; ihc uni- 
versity of the 1990s serves the 
world. 

Mult! cultural ism or cultural 
diversity encompasses racial. 
ethnic, religious, and gender 
ma)(C-up in a specified com- 
munity (like ihc IPFW cam- 
pus). As an institution of high- 
er learning our administration 
is responsible for providing 
learning in two settings. First, 
an obligation falls on the ad- 
ministration to main- 
tain academic 
levels prepara- 
tory lo each 
student' 
market- 
ability. 
Creation! 
of a mul- 
ticultural 
environ- 
ment which 
helps 

students' social 
learning needs is 
the second administra- 
tive responsibility. 

In spile of the efforts of the 
Office of Multicultural Ser- 
vices, this university adminis- 
tration has failed to create a 
culturally diverse campus. As 
a result, we as students have 
tieen denied adequate prepara- 
tion for assimilation into the 
competitive global communi- 
ty. This not only impacts us 
and the corporations we 
choose to work for from a 
trade and finimcial aspect, but 
also from a communications 
aspect. In order to establish 
and maintain appropriate cor- 
porate relationships in a global' 
economy, corporate communi- 
cators representing their com- 
panies need lo know the social 
mores and customs of other 
nations in onjer lo maintain a 
working rapport, (For in- 
stance, il is not customary for 
American businessmen in 
Japan to puke on the premier's 
lap at dinner.) Knowledge and 
acceptance of other cultures 
are imperative to the leaders of 
tomorrow. 

The concept of mere toler- 
ance toward other cultures is 
outdated. No longer can we 
expect olher people of the 
world to adapt and conform to 
the values and judgments of 
the United States. We can no 
longer afford to be viewed as 



"The Ugly American." Mere 
tolerance smacks of arrogance, 
indifference, and stifling cul- 
tural stagnation. 

Knowledge and acceptance 
of olher cultures cannot be ac- 
complished through ignorance, 
and this all-imponant enlight- 
enment should be available on 
university campuses through- 
out the world. The inadequate 
cultural representation and ex- 
periences on this campus lim- 
its social contact and suffo- 
cates cultural acceptance 
among students. In 
1990s negoti- 
lions and de- 
liberations 
c t w e e n 
cultures- 
in-conflict 
require a 
working 
k no w 1 ■ 
edge of 
muliicultur- 
alism. 

How might at- 
titudes change to- 
ward United States mil- 
itary action in Iraq, if students 
on this campus clearly under- 
stood Iraqi mores and cus- 
toms? What prompts one 
group of people lo engage in 
ethnic cleansing? Why do you 
suppose the United States 
Marines were given a crash 
course on Somali customs pri- 
or to iheir beach landing? We 
would clearly understand the 
answers lo these questions if 
our universities provided a 
multicultural learning environ- 
ment 

In order to place world 
events into an appropriate con- 
■|exi. students must understand 
the culture of communities 
foreign 10 their own. The con- 
text determines the perspec- 
tives that need to be applied 
for the best understanding. 
Daily campus contact with 
students of foreign cultures 
would allow IPFW students to 
develop the appropriate con- 
text and perspectives neces- 
sary to mainstream into a 
global community and market- 
place. 

Mulliculturalism on this 
campus could only be an asset 
to the student boiiy. The need 
has been loosely defined. The 
administration must take ac- 
tion now to bencr the campus 
learning environment and the 
ultimate product - students.

was fashionable, months ago. 

The only thing I learned about fash- 
ion while growing up was that you 
should never wear stripes and/or 
plaids of a different paiiem.at the 
same time. This was the cardinal sin 
of cloUies coordination. 
Occasionally I will see some poor 
Fashion starved person 
(invariably an old man) 
wearing plaid pants 
with a polka-dotted 
shin and think, "How 
did this happen? How is 
it that, in 1993, a per- 
son could be soigno— 
rant of the first rule of 
color coordination?" 

Luckily, the first nile 
of fashion was drilled 
into me by my older 
sisters. Nothing teaches 
an impressionable 
young boy belter than 
older sisters who will, 
with great concern and 
sensliiviiy, point out all of his fashion 
faux pas through loving torment and 
ridicule. 

So now I am an adult who knows 
not to mix his prints. Unfortunately, 
that's about all I know. Basically, my 
relationship with Fashion is in the 



Just A Theory 
byTlmSchrelber 



Therefore men. without iliis certain 
gene, have no biological desire to 
shop, as well as have no biological 
inclination to admit when they're 
lost. It'sjusi a theory. 

I always have bad experiences 
shopping for clothes. There is a 
corollary to Murphy's Law Uiat states 
that one-third to one-half of all new 
clothes will never be worn more than 
once, because A) somediing is spilled 



on Uiem B) they don'i miraculously 
"shrink to fit" after washing C) you 
realize how stupid dicy look once you 
get them out of the fitting room. 

But even as the King of Hand-Mc 
Downs. I'm still not loially Fashion 
Impaired. Just the other day, my 
brother gave mc one of his chickens. 
Now if I can just remember where I 
put that smpler,,.

To the Editor: 

IPFW has been enforcing parking 
rules which prohibit students from 
parking at meters at all times. 

While I do understand the uruversi- 
ty's need to have parking available 
for guests to the university, I believe 
die current method of enforcement vi- 
olates students' rights. 

I twlieve die current policy of ticket- 
ing students who park at meters 
should be stopped immediately for 
three reasons: 

Most imporianily, this policy of 
tickeiing students violates dieir due 
process rights guaranteed by the 14di 
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. 
If students with permits are not per- 
mitted to park at meters, that fact 
needs to be conspicuously posted at 
the area where ihe parking meters arc. 
Currently there arc not even signs 
with a "V" for visitors ai some meter 
locadons. The one line in die student 
handbook does not constitute "due 
notice." 

Secondly, if the university adheres 
to die cunent policy of ticketing stu- 
dents widi permits who park at me- 
ters, a uniform procedure for register- 
ing ALL siudcnt vehicles needs to be 
established. Policies have changed 
making this policy affect some stu- 
dents and others not at all. 

In die past students were only given 
a parking permit after filling out a 



form lo register their vehicle and die 
license plate number being registered 

for that vehicle, iticrcforc. creating a 
file of registered vehicles. The univer- 
sity's new procedure of passing out 
permits at the Bursar's Office upon 
registration docs not require die same 
vehicle information be submitted, 
therefore, their plates arc not regis- 
tered in die same manner. 

The result of these different proce- 
dures are die IPFW parking police be- 
ing unable lo diffcreniiate between a 
student and a visitor. Procedures, 
which are not uniform for all stu- 
dents, violate equal protection which 
is guaranteed under die ]4ih amend- 
Finally, the unavailability of park- 
ing, except at meters, violates the | 
contract agreed upon when students I 
purchased their parking pemiits in die ! 
first place, I 

I urge all students to use their proce- 
dural righis and write an appeal if 1 
Lckcied ai a meter. The forms arc in I 
the campus police office. The best 
way to change the policy is to use the 
existing rights you have!

Hill will be the Flora Robens lec- 
turer and keynote speaker for Affir- 
mative Action Awareness Week ai 
the Edward C, Elliot Hall of Music 
on the Wcsi Lafayette campus. 

During ihc televised Supreme 
Court Justice Senaie Confirmation 
hearings for Clarence Thomas in 
Oct, 1991. Hill's testimony brought 
■lie issue of sexual harassment to na- 
tional attention. 

"Purdue University has a commii- 
menl to human relations and to ex- 
plore and inquire about issues that 
affect the quality of life within the 
university community." said Judith 
Gappa. Purdue vice-president for 
human relations. 

"One of these issues is scjtual ha- 



, the theme of this year's 
celebration of Affinnativc Action 
Awareness Week," Gappa cotitinues. 
"Anita Hill fits with this ihcmc per- 
fectly." 

In 1977. Hill received her bache 
lor's degree from Oklahoma State 
University. She received her law de- 
gree from Yale University in 1979, 
and admitted to the District of Co- 
lumbia Bar in 1980. 

In 1980, Hill was an associate with 
ihc Washington, D.C.. firm of Wald, 
Harkiadet and Ross. A year later she 
worked as the assistant secretary of 
the Department of Education's Of- 
fice of Civil Rights. She served as 
adviser to the chairman of the Equal 
Employment Opportunities Com- 
mission in 1982. 

From 1983-86, Hill laught at Oral 
Roberts University as an assistant 
professor. Since then, she teaches 
courses on civil rights, commercial 
law and contracts at the Universiiy 
of Oklahoma School of Law.

non-traditional and minority pro- 
grams. 

Zimmerman believes that special 
funding would take less time if IPFW- 
was its own fiscal agent. 

"Every grant we apply for has to be 
routed and approved through West 
Lafayette," Zimmerman said. "Gram 
deadlines arc often close because of 
all the red tape." 

Larry W. Griffin, director of 
Helmke Library, explained that the li- 
brary receives its money from two 
main sources: ihe I.U. Library Sys- 
tem, which I.U. centrally pays for the 
on line catalog hardware, software. 
and programming; and the budget 
proposal, which he submits to Ihc 
Chancellor. 

"Fortunately, ihe library budget has 
never been cut and sometimes we 
have received increases." said Griffin. 
"What hurts us is that journals in- 
crease by at least 15% per year, and 
the budget doesn't." 

Griffin feels thai ihe library, as a 
different kind of agency than the aca- 
demic schools, doesn't know if fiscal 
autonomy will affect the library very 
much. 

The process of legislative budgeting 
for IPFW was presented at the Com- 
munity Advisory Council meeting as 
follows: 

the first quarier of the calendar 



year, Purdue establishes guidelines 
for budgets and IPFW submits budga 
priority requests according lo the 
guidelines of the Lafayette Office of 
Fiscal Plarming, 

Phirdue deletes or refines specific 
IPFW requests and submits a sysiem- 
wide budget to ihc Indiana Commis- 
sion for Higher Education. Any re- 
quested c lari fie ai ions concerning 
IPFW are submitted to West 
Lafayette only. 

West Lafayette may choose to ask 
for IPFW input, but is not required to 
do so. Gener^ly. the IPBV chancel-

cers are allowed lo meet only with

Gates: a man who has seen it all 



by Michael Bass 

Sports Editor 

On Saturday, Jan. 16 his voice rang 

over the din of basketballs and made 
ils way to televisions aaoss the area, 
to those that tuned in for the North- 
eastern High school basketball Con- 
ference finals. 

This voice has been sounding out 
for decade aflCT decade, and ihc man 
behind the voice lias seen ii all. 

Milliard Gates has become synony- 
mous with spons in much of Indiana. 
He announced play by play for high 
school baskciball, Purdue University 
Lafayette football, and the NBA all- 
star games during ihc early 50's lo 
name a few. 

However, Gales started his career 
elsewhere. He was born in 
Muskegon, Michigan and there he be- 
gan his long lasting career. His first 
announcing Job came as the 
Muskegon high school public address 
an noun ca. 

Gates aitribuics his successful ca- 
reer 10 the support and help of oihcrs. 
His first break came when a colum- 
nist for the Muskegon Chronicle 
wrote and suggested the radio station 
in town was missing a "bet" by not 
hiring Gates to do their sports. 



"In those days, you didn't just do 
spons; you worked si% hours a day 
doing disc jockeying. We ran music. 
read news, and described the pa- 
rades," said Gates, "but then I also 
began to do the play 
by play broadcast of 
the high school 
games." 

Gates said he did 
thai for three years, 
but then he started 
looking for a bigger 
market. 

-I kept reading 
Broadcasimg Maga- 
zine and looking at 
ads in the magazine. 
There was one that 
looked kind of nice 
because ii was mid- 
west, it didn't say 
what state it was in, 
but seemed to stand 
out to me and for some reason I an- 
swered it." said Gates. 

He got the job and found himself in 
Fort Wayne announcing high school 
games for WOWO in die 40's. From 
then on, Gales would announce al- 
1 solely for Fort Wayne and its 

uilying areas. 




[n 1941. the Pistons came together 
in Fort Wayne, and Gates found Lme 
to do the play by play for their 
games, too. He was wiih the team 
when they won ihe world champi- 
onship in Chicago in 



1967 he was asked to do the Rose 
Bowl. A great honor to him, and an 
even greater honor was to armouncc it 
two years in a row, which he did an- 
nouncing the Rose Bowl game in 6S 
also. 

Today Gates spends his semi-retired 
career in an office at WKJG, but still 
he continues broadcasting. He has 
had many highlights in his career. 

He even had a part in the movie 
Hoosiers ^d says the dumbest thing 
he ever did was. when asked to do the

During the 1950- 

51 NBA season, die 

NBA esiabtished the 

firsi NBA all-siar 

game, and Hilliard 

Gales shared the 

spotlight with a New part for the movie he told the director 

York announcer, an- he had other engagements for that 
week. Of course, he broke them and 
ended up playing the pan of die an- 
nouncer, 

"Having a building named after you 
isn't too shabby," said Gates in re- 
gards to the Hilliard Gates Sports 
Cenier at IPFW. He says he feels 
proud of it, not to mention a little 
funny about it. 

How long he will continue doing 
play by play, he docs not know. His 
career and his life have become syn- 
onymous widi Fort Wayne and spons.

Listen to his voice 



By Michael Ba.ss 
Sports Editor 

When I moved to this city I had 
never heard of Hilliard Gates. He 
was a figure thai held no meaning 
tome. 

In Fort Wayne, he was already a 
legendary figure. Many people 
spent their nighis listening lo his 
voice and having ihc game (what- 
ever game that may be) brought to 
life. 

Then [ heard talk of naming a 
building after him, but still I paid 
Utde attention. 

However, one day 
two weeks ago I 
found myself in his 
office. I was doing an 
interview for the Commi 
(that wonderous newspaper that 
circulates at IPFW 111). 

There I was sitting in his office. 
What was I to expect from this 
man? Surely not what 1 received. 

We talked about Gates' life that 
day, and the interview was filled 
with highlights of his long sports 
career. 

He told me about the Detroit Pis- 
tons once making their home here, 
I learned about high school basket- 
ball, college basketball, college 
football (his time with Purdue and 
Indiana University spons,) 



The ball's 
in my court 



This man was a fountain of infor- 
mation, and 1 was trying to absorb 
it all. 

When the interview ended, 1 de- 
cided dial this man was the greatest 
person I had ever met. 

1PF&gt;V is lucky to have a pan of 
him m the naming of the Hilliard 
Gates Sports Cenier. And I be- 
lieve every person who enters that 
building should slop and thank 
Hilliard Gates for enriching the 
spons communiiy. 

Every IPFW student who has any 
kind of love for sports 
should know and love 
Hilliard Gates, And it 
you have never met 
the man, never heard 
the man, or never had him touch' 
your life, then I feel a little sad for 
you. 

This great man has evolved into a 
cornerstone of ihc Fort Wayne 
Community And with people like 
him, here in Fon Wayne. I believe 
this town will coniinuc lo grow into 
3 strong, sports-loving city. 

One day Hilliard Gales will pass 
on and so will we. but his career, 
his life, and his building will stand 
forever, IPFW has been blessed lo 
have such a great spons building 
stand for such a legendary sports

Lady 'Dons fall short, lose two 



by Michael Bass 
SporU Editor 

Tuesday. Jan, 12, Si. Francis was 
in iDwn 10 visit ihc Lady 'Dons ai 
iJie Hilliard Oaics Aihlciic Center. 
Si. Francis left with victory winning 
63-61. 

The Lady 'Dons captured a 14 
point lead before watching it dwin- 
dle during the last 12 minutes of the 
game. With 2:27 left in ihc game Si, 
Francis wrenched the lead away 
from the Lady 'Dons at 58-57. 

With seven seconds left in the 
game and ihc Lady 'Dons down by 
two, freshman Lindy Jones pulled up 
for a three pointer ihal bounced off 
Ihc back of ihc rim to end the game. 

Coach Eiiccn KIcinfcltcr feels that 
even though her team had taken a 14 
point lead that their heads were nev- 
er really in the game. 

She also attributes Si. Francis' 
comeback win to the play of forward 
Heidi Wright who shot 10 of 19 
from the field and led all scorers 
widi 24 points. 

■'She just had an inaedible second 
half. Everything she put up went in." 
said KJcinfclicr on Wright's play. 

On Saturday. Jan. 16, the Lady 
'Dons travelled to Ashland. Ohio to 
face Ashland University. The Lady 
'Dons who were down by 18 at one 
time pulled the game within 5 to 
lose 69-64. 

"Our team is one diat docs not give 
up, and docs make comebacks," said 
Klcinfclter, 

KIcinfcltcr feels that comeback dri- 
ve will be vital later in ihc season, 
and is optimistic on the rest of the 
season. 

With Dawn Dressier not playing 

ue to a deaih in her family the team 
was missing one of its key players.

"The team really put forth the ef- 
fort to pick up ihe loose ends," said 
Klcinfclicr. "We just came up with 
the short end of the slick," 

Against Ashland junior Kim 
Recker led the team with 14 points, 
and at home against St. Francis she 
led the team with 17 points convert- 
ing 7 of 1 3 from the field. 

Junior Amy Perkins has seen a lot 
of playing lime this year. She has av- 
eraged 39 minutes in her last five ap- 
pearances, and is averaging 33.5 
minutes of play for ihe year. 

The Lady 'Dons will face Bel- 
larmine at the HiJIiard Gates Atlilct- 
ic Center tonighi at 6:05 p.m. 

Bcllarmine is 5-1 in the confer- 
ence. KIcinfcltcr feels that they are a 
very tough bail team. She feels ihey 
have a very strong offense led by 
three good ouiside shooters.

dents at IPFW.

Defense does the talking 



Dy Michael Bass 
Sports Editor 

At Ashland, the 10- 2 Mastodons lei 
their defense do the talking, high- 
lighted by a defensive stint that held 
Ashland to only three points in the 
first ten minutes of the second half. 

The team went on to beat Ashland 
73-53. The victory brings their con- 
ference play above .500 with a 3-2 
record. 

Junior Scott Slnunons and Senior 
Scan Gibson led the team on offense, 
both with 14 points. Seniors Shane 
Gibson and Pat Murphy followed 
right behind with 13 points each. 

The offense, which got off to a slow 
Stan shooting only 38 percent, picked 
up the pace in the second half, shoot- 
ing 62 pcrt;cni from the field. 

"Wc did a nice job offensively of 
getting the ball to iJic open area," said 
coach Andy Piazza, on the team's 
second half play. 

The team will p!ay at home tonight 
Jan. 21 against Bellarmine at the 
Hilliard Gates Sports Center, Game 
time is after the women's game at ap- 
proximately 8:05 p.m. 

Pia/yji feels it is vital to sweep Bel- 
larminc this year in order to have a 
chance at conference. However, he 



feels that Bellarminc will be a lough 
game. 

Bel tannine has been given a btwsi 
with ^eir newest player from Divi- 
sion One. Andy Penick. 

Penick transferred from Michigan 
Slate University. Penick, a 6'2" 
guard, has shot over 20 points at each 
of Bellarminc's last two games. 

Saturday the team will face Ken- 
tucky State University ai the Hilliard 
Gates Spons Center at 8:05 p.m.

Some of Locssi's imporiani coniri- 
butions 10 the IPFW music communi- 
ty dial would never make an official 
obituary are included below. 

Former siudem Grclchen King, B S. 
Music Therapy "92, remembers when 
Locssi showed compassion to one of 
the students. This young woman was 
trying to make it on her own with 
very little money. She wore the same 
wom-Dui tennis shoes every day to 
school, even when ii snowed, 

Loessi asked King to find out, in a 
discreet way, ihe young woman's 
shoe size. King did, while the woman 
was wiuiing for a bus ride home. 

Shortly thereafter, a pair of leather 
winter snow boots anonymously ap- 
peared ncKi 10 that young woman's 
locker. King knew thai Locssi had 
bought the boots for die student. 

"Thai was die epitome of his life." 
said King. "He did such wonderful 
things from the heart.. .everything 
with passion, and compassionate. 
And he was so intclligeni, a gifted 
musician, and a leachei who encour- 
aged students lo do cverydiing lo Uie 
besiof dieirabililics." 

Former IPFW siudeni, Bill 
Rcinking. B,A. Music/Theater '90, 
now living in New York City, de- 
scribed Locssi: 

"Mr. Loessi was my professor, men- 
lor, faiher-figure. and close friend. 1 
will always remember him for the 
War Requiem that die IPFW Chorus 
performed with die Fort Wayne Phil- 
harmonic. It was an incredibly hard 
piece to sing," said Reinking.

Loessi leaves legacy of kindness 



John Loes.si conducts at IPFW even though his hand i! 
department of music. 



"Ii was so beautiful, and combined 
music with poems about the horrors 
of war. It was a piece very dear to Mr, 
Loessi 's hean." 

Reiking saw ihe War Requiem per- 
formed last year in New York City 
and sent a program to Locssi along 
wiih a noic. He visited wiih Loessi 
just two weeks ago while home in 
Fon Wayne. 

"He touched and enriched people's 
lives. ..he will always be a part of my 
life," Reinking remarked. 

Another former IPFW student, 
Phyliss Sclig, B.S. Elementary Edu- 
cation '87. and member of the Fort 
Wayne Philharmonic Chorus, also 
mentioned Locssi's compassion to- 
wards others. 

Selig went into labor during his 
singing class and remembers that he 
was very concerned aboui her well- 
being. He was one of die few people 
who came to visit Selig and her new 
son in die hospital. 

Sclig recalls, "He said, 'When you 
sing, you have to e;ipcricnce the emo- 
tions in the music. You have lo really 
grieve, really worship, and really love 
10 be able to sing from the heart.' 

"He was an unbelievable musician, 
and laught mc how to hear music in a 



way that five theory classes couldn't," 
concluded Sclig. 

Todd Samra, an IPFW senior major- 
ing in music, discussed Locssi's inHu- 
ence on his life. 

"He was a very personable director, 
and of all die professors, he was the 
one students could talk to... his fair- 
ness and approach to everything 
seemed equal," said Samra. 

'■Whether he liked or disliked 
pieces," Samra continued, "He al- 
ways taught them with the same 
amount of endiusiasm. We all learned 
a greai deal about music from him, 
but even more so about life." 

A close friend, who wishes to re- 
main anonymous, said Loessi com- 
posed and performed a piece of music 
for one of his former students. He re- 
cently wrote it down in his own cal- 
ligraphy and intended to give it as a 
gift. Hopefully, it will be found soon 
and given to its intended owner. 

Denise Schwaberow, a junior music 
major, summarized the influence of 
John Loessi as a friend to bodi faculty 
and students. 

"He was the most fair man and 
teacher I have ever met. He taught 
about music and about life."

John Loessi 

musician and inspiring educator. In 
addition to setting a rigorously intel- 
lectual standard for his students, he 
also communicated a inic passion for 
his art. He would as often yell about 
the "guts and lire" as he would about 
intonation. This personally modest, 
even shy man could become a demon 
on the podium, with a gleam in his 
eye that would mesmerize his per- 
formers into nmking beaudful music. 
John's true legacy, however, will be 
a result of his basic humanity- the 
neck rubs he gave to weary staff, the 



hugs 10 those he sensed were down. 
the books and clothes, anonymously 
given to students who were in 5nan- 
cia! dilTiculiy. die frequent counsel- 
ing, compassionate yet honest, of- 
fered to students in trouble. A small 
example of both die personal support 
he gave to others and of his commit- 
ment 10 professional standards is his 
almost perfect attendance record at 
conceris given by faculty and stu- 
dents of the Music Department, de- 
spite the inconvenience of arranging 
iransporiaiion to die campus since he 
did not drive. 

John loved life, utilizing each mo- 
ment to the utmost, much as he plant- 
ed his 5" by 10' front yard with all the 
landscaping possible. He would bring 
one of his wonderful culinary cre- 
ations- "comfort food"- to whai we 
all knew would be a difficuli faculty 
meciing. Even such a little tiling as a 
new technique for humanely trapping 
tiis cats to wash them would excite 
him. 

He never lei ill hcaldi imerfcrc widi 
his work. Several limes he conducted 
both rehearsals as well as concerts 
widi healdi problems such as a high 
fever or having his hand in a cast. It 
is. therefore, no surprise dial he con- 
ducted 3 Christmas Eve rehearsal 
while in great pain, postponing a trip 
to the hospital emergency room until 
after the rehearsal. He later apolo- 
gized for the inconvenience he caused 
to those left behind to perform widi- 
outhim. 

The spirit with which he lived his 
personal and musical life will warmly 
endure for the many people who had 
the privilege of knowing him or enpe- 
riencing his magic on die podium." 



Focus on... Studying, test taking 



By Kay Hinga 
Footprints Editor 

1) Use Ihe same lechniques as your 
friend who gets "A's." TTi ere' should 
be no difference in dig way each per- 
son studies. 

2) Asking questions in class is forbid- 
den. All professors think questions 
are stupid, and will lower your grade 
accordingly. 

3) Never read the book before a 
lest — it isn't imponant. 

4) Skip class as often as you can. The 
professor doesn't have anything to 
say that you need to hear. 



5) Don't study until the night before 
the final. It's always easiest to Icam 
cverylhing in one night, 

6) AU-nightcrs are ihc best way lo 
!eam ihe material, and you will be re- 
freshed and rested at test dme. 

7) Speling isnn't improtani, cspaeiel- 
ly in Engliesh Comp clascsses, so 
donn'i wonie if yuo cann't spcl.'The 
proffessor will corraci yur errers. 

8) Don't look for answers to your 
questions in your books, as diis leads 
to learning, and college is for having 
fun. Besides, the professor gets paid 
to find the answers for you. 



9) Study groups should be avoided at 
all costs. You are the only one who 
heard the professor right so odier stu- 
dents cannot help. 

10) Grammar ain't important nohow, 
SO don't worry about how ya written 
your paper. 

11) aLWAYS. mAKE Sure to (ignore) 
your punctuation?, and, grammar 
rules:— when — writing a paper; 
yOUR professor's will love yOU 7 
for IT!!?! 

12) When all else fails, cheat. The 
tests are just for the professor's bene- 
fit, and don't matter to you.
