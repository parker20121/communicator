lit business completed at the 
Sepiemlier 20 meeting ol tbe 
Student Senate. 

John Ainlej', Crec Grochen- 
our, and BernlceDammeyer were 
I'locied from a slate of seven 
candidates Irom Indian^. 

The resolution, introduced by 
President Mark Souder, proposed 
that 'the student Senate of In- 
dMiiij-Purdue University, while 
nnt necessarily endorsing the 
Vietnam War, repudiates the en- 
dorsement bytberepresentatives 
attending thelndlanaStudentsAs- 



soiiaiion mooiiiiK of September 
28 ol the October 15 classroom 
bovcoti In support of the one- 
day moratorium on Vietnam". 
Souder staled that the classroom 
boyrolt was "an Individual de- 
cision rather than a concern of 
student government". The res- 
olution was passed unanimously. 

Discussion concerning a 
Campus Government Convention 
In Detroit octot&gt;er 23-26 ended 
in a majority vote to appropriate 
funds for three students to at- 
tend with Dean D. Richard Smith 
and Dean Roger Manges of tlie 
Ofllce of Student Services. 

Earlier Id the evening Dean 
Smith spoke ol secondary (non- 
academic) functions of the C^am- 



pus, Kenneth Kelli 
Dean for Administration, dis- 
cussed the constraints placed an 
the growth of the campus as a 
result of lack of approprialed 
funds from the stale legislature. 
Dean Manges presented a new 
procedure concerning custodial 
services for recognized student 
organizations. Dr. Ernest P. 
Weckesser, represented the Pur- 
due Faculty Senate in expressing 
the hope ttiat the student Govern- 
ment would report to the Fort 
Wayne Senate to open lines of 
communication l&gt;etween the two 
tiodles. He also Indicated that 
a representative from the stu- 
dent newspaper and from the 
student t)ody would be invited to 
Sit In on the faculty meetings. 



Input bi many people" the basic 
needs have t&gt;een supplied to all 
departments concerned. 

Part of a Joint sialemenl 
Issued by Purdue and Indiana 
Deans, Dr. D. Hlcbard Smith and 
Dr. ilalph E. nroyles said; 
"Great credit Is due the mem- 
bers of the Joint Building pro- 
gram Development Committee 
wlio have spent many hours de- 
termining space needs of various 
Indiana and Purdue departments, 
and allocating footage which will 
be available In Building A, . ,'■

Purdue and Indiana operations at

a posslbUlty not ruled out by 
planners. 



Student Government plans new constitufion 



Plaits are now underway to 
Investigate the possibilities for 
writing a new student govern- 

asslgned to the task Is headed 
by Mike Nusbaumer, a student 

A similar attempt made last 
year ended with a 40-page docu- 
ment containing duties and re- 
sponsibilities of all brandies ot 
student government. This consti- 
tution filled, however, to meet 
the Deans' approval. 

One reason for itsfailurewas 
given by Cordell Mathleu, student 
body president. Referringto sec- 
lion IX of article three, Duties 
and Powers regardlne the Student 



Senate, he noted thatltempower- 
ed a senator to request of the 
Assistant Dean for Student Ser- 
vices to require a student's 
presence before the Senate for 
tnvestieatlons if necessary. 
"This would require authority 
the Deans have not been given," 
he said. 

"Vague" and "ambiguous in 
places", was the description 
given by Mark Souder, student 
government vice-president. 

Committee head ^'usbailme^ 
believed certain sections would 
have to be rewrittenand clarified 
with much of the original con- 
stitution left remalnlDg as he tell 



It was "basically good" 

Former student 
Robert York Is given credit for 
the initial effort last year to 
devise a more uniform consli- 
tuiion incorporating i 
branches of student government 
that were under separate con- 
stitutions. 

Student government Is now 
operating under an older con- 
stitution dating from 1965. Itwas 
this constitution that originally 
fell under criticism leading to 
tbe attempts ai revision. 

President Mathleu stated he 
hoped the new constiiuUon would 
be ready In "May before student 
elections".

Time to ask Jor peace— change

Negative minds speed apathy 

by Jennifer Bosk 



''A5k nol whal yciur coiiniri'

yoo can do lor your ciuniry." 
This, a now stale and trite re- 
Italn, passed from a man to a 
nation to become pari of a leg- 
end lliat was both born am] killed 
In a Dallas F&gt;arade. That sunny 
r^ovembcr day. Imprinted In a 
nation's tnemory by a tilgh pow- 
ered nne and Ihepholosrapher's 
frozen Image, slowly &lt;:loudi?dand 
softened Into what became a 
legend. 

The legeiKlary and perhaps 
mythical promise wrapped in the 
Iriwiery of ''vltalliy' , "human- 
ity" and "reascm" Is today as 
dead as the man who spot^e U. 
Broken aiid tattered by atisassl- 
nadons qikI publicity, Its rinal end 
'came at the edge i&gt;f a lirldKe, 
Id an overturned spurts car. The 
promise ol belter times with a 
man dial understood cbant.-e and 
who could brine ii as well as 
move Willi It, Is Jott unrealized. 

Now crysiallzeU back lo the 
original picture of horror In 
1903, the legend Is replaced in 
1900 wlih the vlolenci- of llie 



hl;h powered rifle. It Is the 
violence of a rioting mob in a 
Ctiicaj:o sireei, a dying whimper 
In a dark ghetto alley, or the 
long, long scream of a Viet- 
nam torture session. 

Sloraiorium: a time to look 
back at a Iet;end named John 
and look at a war called Viet- 
nam and ask for a change — 

A relative handful gather a- 
round a cold impersonal machine 
ol war lo speak lor -10,000 who 
nevi-r will, and stand fur thou- 
sands wounded and paralyzed who 
cannot. They sing "Where have

I would painfully like to point 
out that there exists on the In- 
diana-Purdue Regional Campus 
of Fort Waj-ne two lypesof people; 
those that have an open mind and 
those that haie a constant nega- 
tive mind. 

The negative minded people 
can be drawn in resemblance to 
the common middle- class person 
In io'la&gt;''s society. He Is one that

criiicizing a person Instead ol 
the Institution that he represents. 
As an example, this reasoning

Constructive and destructive cri-

solution and a betier way of do-

energy to do anything about It, -

campus, though. Many other or-

partly everyone's fault. Most of 
us presently In student govern- 
ment fell left out before we be- 

In student governmeiii who one 
year ago dldn'l know who was 
Student Body President. 

The iiuestlon should nol be 
the lople of who is responsible 
for the problem, but how lo solve 
It. Last spring studentswere con- 
cerned and "demands" were pre- 
sented. Now, when the "de- 
mands" are being worked on, 
nearly every "concerned stu- 
dent has disappeared, wllh such 
notable exceptions as aeve Pet- 
tyjohn, Mike Nusbaiimer, Mike 
I^mbonie, and Harry Luchnen- 

Reallzlng that the excitement 
is over. It's disappointing to see 
so many students' convictions 
disappear wiien the prospect of 
boring work appears, if you are 
one of ihp students who feels

closed, and doesn'i know what

mand no effort or work from their 
members and sometimes not even 
from their officers, thus onabl- 
Ing someone to be In everything 
without being a "polentlal 
leader". 

Or what alioui those who are 
developing Uito leaders laier than 
ihose who supposedly proved 
themselves In high sclioolv Al 
most everyone has heard of an 
"academic late-bloomer" - - - 
one who doesn't show much aca- 
demic achlovemeni until he is 
finishing high school or slarilng 
college. Is It not possible then, 
lo have "late-bloomers" Inother 
areas of life? 

Some students voluntarily give 
up extracurricular activities In 
order lo eai-n money for college 
so that Ihey won't have lo work 
during their college years and 
can be free lo participate In such 
college activities. Are those also 
to be denied an initial chance at 
leadership? 

In a inonlh or so, the spon- 
sors say, thev will be able to 
tell whether the weekend was a 
success, depending upon whether 
the tweniv-four Creshmen Involv- 
ed stay In student government. 
It seems that In a month, more 
than JuEi walling lo see If the 
freshmen remain active, ought to 
be accomplished. 

What about expanding fresh- 
men orlenlailon to give all In-' 
coming freshmen Ihe opportunity 
to (Ind out what Is really going 
on? Then give all those who wish 
the chance to become actively In- 
volved sothatmoreleadersmlght 
be developed. Afterwards, can- 
duci something similar loaiead- 
ership weekend, perhaps Instead 
of Jusi 3 weekend. It would be 
more profitable to havea loader- 
ship workshop of some son, con- 
sisting of meeilnga lo work with 
the freshmen and include follow- 
up meetings to help them oui.

application of the empires, eco-

Empire has ceased lobe dynamic. 
Bebre conilnuing wllh our 
study of the American Empire, 
It would be wise to take a brief 
glance at other Emplresand their 
saturation points. The ancient 
Persian Empire reached Its sat- 
uration point when It collided with 
the Greek city-states. The Per- 
sian Empire, prior to Its con- 
flict, had exiended lis hegemony 
trom Its power and culture base 
of Asia Minor over all related 



cultures and power systems In 
the Easiern Medlieranean world, 
lis Inability to conquer and assi- 
milate the Creek city-states and 
their alien culture signified the 
fact thai Its saturation point had 
been reached, Theencounterwith 
the Greek city-states was a fail- 
ure for the Persians and the 
sharpness and complete failure 
of their effort was to bring about 
3 deierlorathDO In Persia that 
would be (iital. 

The Roman Empire reached 
Its saturation point around the 
time of Christ. This was signi- 
fied when Ihe Romans were de- 
feated In the heartland ol Asia 
Minor by the Parthlans andalong 
the EltK River, the heartland of 
Europe, by the Germanic tribes.
