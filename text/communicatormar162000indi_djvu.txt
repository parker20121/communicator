In November of last year, The 

| Journal Gazelle ran a story called 

"Street Kids Shoot Amazing Photos 

of Their Reality ." This story was 

' about a group of kids in Jakarta.

lived in every day Many touching 

; pictures were taken, but the most 

touching is the world that these 

children have (□ live in. 

They took pictures of their 
friends doing drugs. They look pic- 
tures of ibeir 10- and 11-year-old 
brothers and sisters gelling high &lt;ii 
paint fumes. One 11-year-old girl 
took a picture of some children 
scavenging for food on a mountain 
of garbage. A bulldozer came by (o

area, hut not all the children man 
aged to escape. They were buried in 
garbage while trying to find enough 

Another boy, who was 9 when 
he was abandoned by his mother, 
started selling drugs to buy rice

to raise money. Yet another picture 
showed a crippled man crawling 
along the sidewalk, begging foi 
money to buy a spoonful of rice. 

touched greatly and it makes me, as 
it should make us alt. think about 
the freedom and opponumucs we 
have in the United Slates. 

I was watching a French 
movie a few weeks ago called. "La 
Vie SurLaTcrTe."Tbc basic prem- 
ise behind the movie, whose title 
means "Life on Earth," is to follow 
a day in the life of an African town 
named Socolo. The movie was fan- 
tastic 1 was amused by scenes of 
the town telephone. It would ■ -n K 
connect half of the lime. There was 
one radio stauon that broadcast in 
Socolo and it was mostly talk radio 
There were no cars and getting a 
new bike was like moving up in the 
world. The townspeople would 
' dress up to get their pictures taken 
from an old-ume camera. The pan 
of the movie that 1 loved the most 
. was a group of guys who sat in 
: front of a building. They listened to 
; (he radio and watched people go by 
all day long When the sun started 
to land on them, they moved their 
chairs back into the shade Finally, 
at the end of 



; chairs and wen 



it home— surely to 

■ cc oau ure next day. 

I was amused by this film, but 
I I was touched as well. My comput- 

■ er has been broken this past week 

i It bad same vims dial 1 couldn't get 
', rid of. It was very frustrating 
' because I couldn't write my papers 
• thai were due, I couldn'l check my 
e-mail and most importantly. 1 
. couldn't sit in front ol my comput- 
er for endless bouts, talking to my 
friends on Instant Messenger. Yes, 
there is a bint of sarcasm in (hat last 
sentence. Over the past week. I 
realized how caught up in "things" 
1 am. We. meaninp uur society, are 
so caught up in the accumulation of 

on life. We arc so focused on keep- 
ing up with our neighbors and hav- 
ing that new car. (hat we forget lo 
take care of (he more important 
things like family and friends. 

The children of Jakarta may 
know what a computer is, but 
chances are very good that not too 
many of them have one The people 
of Socolo do not have computer* 
and to even talk to someone on the 
phone is a rare occasion In the 
United States, we have two, maybe 
three computers in every room, a 
. TV and phone for sure in every 
room and most of us have food and 
shelter As mis is the turning of the 
; century, and only because that 
makes a good starting point, we 
should all examine ourselves and 
what is important. Do we take our 
. freedoms for granted? Do we take 
; our freedoms to extremes and try to 
exploit them? Are we more con- 
• cemed with buying stuff than we 
!are in nurturing friendships and 
; relationships? I can't answer for 
anyone but myself, but I know that 
1 have many things lo work on.

When no one shows up 





peiitors did no; even show up for the garni: 
This act is completely lame ,ind dishonorable 
It may be a simple game of fun. however, sev- 



eral individuals made 
ri i- ri i To simply not show up is 
unacceptable. Shouldn't we com- 
plete every day as if it were our 
last? Aren't first impressions one 
of the most lasting impressions? 

Perhaps not. Ii seems thai it 
is okay to disappoint whomever 
we want, whenever we want We 
have experienced this with some of 
our past staff as well. First or all, 
we'd like to mention that we really 
appreciate the work of those who 
actually do the work. However, we 
have learned that people love la talk, but 
often times, they can't always complete Ihe 
walk. On some occasions we never hear from 
them agaio-hmmm. Feeling a little gudly? 
Who knows? We believe that failing to come 



througb on a commitment is 
things a person can do. Unfortunately, every- 
one has done it al one time or another. 

la case some of you didn't know, (and 
you do) when you stand someone up. you 
leave a huge headache for others lo relieve. 
Do we even need to mention that one's trust 
and reputation are completely tarnished after 
failing lo come through? 

We are calling out to all the people out 
there who never finish a lask. Slop? Take 
pride in yourself and everything you do. If a 
person docs not have pride in him or herself, 
who will? It makes it very difficult for others 
lo have pride in a person as well. 

No matter bow small or insignificant a 
commitment or task may seem, it needs to be 
fulfilled. Someday the person or persons you 
left hanging could come back to haunt you.

Christ prevails 

To the Editor 

In the Feb. 17 edition of The Communicator, 
Lisa Galloway. Staff Writer, describes "Chris liaiu'iy 
(as) the house that guilt built" 

1 can relate to Lisa's frustration with organized 
religion Religion Ls women and men reaching out lo 
God. Because women and men are flawed, religion 
will sooner or later let us down. 

However, there is good news. Christ is God 
reaching out lo women and men. And He will never 
let us down. 



Questioning the gas monster 



I'm sure many ol sou fuse already beard aboul Ibe cur-

ter is to "infect" those ol you who are reading this, who have 
not already been "exposed." tNote: If you don't know what a 
"media virus" is and are interested in finding out. you should 
read Douglas Rushkoff s book tided "Media Virus." published 
by Rivcrhcad Books.) 

The "Gas Qui" phenomenon is a widespread communi- 
cation clfon to Organize a gasoline boycott on the weekend of 
April 7, 8 and 9 The boycott is intended to "force" OPEC lo 
lower the pre sendy "riigh" cost of our fuel back ta a level we

Uni" Waited a-, .in e-mail nie&gt;s,iee urging people to stand up 
for their consumer rights and temporarily boycott and has been 
forwarded throughout Ihe Internet com/nunitv/culturc bv 
means such as "chain - 1 c iter" style mailing lists, bulletin boards 
and just plain word ol trmudi on Hie streets As 1 already knew, 
this idea is actually a repetition of an almost tJsntic.il etloii 
pi. limed lor Apnl 111. I'l'W However. ihr.s year the "virus" 
seems to have enjoyed a litUe more "fluidity" in its ability to 
spread and has been tipped lo a period bf ihree days instead of 

The idea has enjoyed [and hopefully will continue lo) a 
fairly ;&gt;».J success rate for "reiteration" and has been met with 
iiiikIi eniiei in In iho-e nli.. iiinli-r-Lind the issuc(s) al hand 
One of the most common arguments against the "Gas Out," 
which I tend to agree is idi is mat by purchasing our fuel either 
in the days before or after Ihe boycott, we achieve near I v none 
of our boycotts' original intention to hurt OPEC fm.meialt. 
Aside from minor and temporary alterations to the major oil 
companies' usually -minuti conuol Over the flow (i.e liquida- 
tion and refilling of gas station surpluses), which will cost 
them at least a bu in rescheduling trucking, operating retail 
icres during barely profitable hours, etc.— aside from the gnat 
rm//iiii&gt; in die ear (if Ihe "dogs of oil," we'll have done serv 
little; we'll still buy their gas-just on a different day. 

In order for us to actually call the elTort a boycott, we'll 
need to not use our cars or al least use more efficient forms of 
iron i-.n.iin'ii such :ls moioiciclc.s. mass transit, car-pooling 
etc I &gt;r maybe we could even temporarily pui aside our civi- 
lized, very American laziness and walk, bicycle, rollcrblade or 
whatever lo gel as many of the places we have to go as possi- 



ble Now Ihat would cost ihe oil monopoly at least, i noineahle 
chunk of their usual profit margin After aJL the seventh, 
eighth and ninth fall on a weekend and that's usually when 
they raise gas prices a few cenls anyway in order to capitalize 
on our higher consumption. 

This is an excellent idea in my opinion. Along with many 
others, I will truly boycott on the aforementioned days, but 
prove me wrong here, the majority of you will do nothing lo 

take pari rn this small, but excellent opportunity I pes ii.su- 

cally predict that al least half of Ihe people who hear about this 
issue will not even go as far as lo re-schedule their gas pur- 
chase. U days other than Apnl seven, eight and nine Like 1 
said, prove me wrong. 

Having said all ol this, let me move on to what I feel is t 
lie ie.il issue ol this situation While this effort is being por- 
trayed wilb ihe intention of lowering our present gas prices, I 
k'liese Uua arc moit iijipurLmi ukuloeie-, using iu come lo 
light lure i This is where an understanding of the icnn "media 
virus" will come in very helpful.) 

Isec toe "Gas Out" sensation as being just that: A sensa- 
tional srory eom/tiriinj' iragmtni&gt; of a much bigger picture or 
nie-.-. ( ,'e hiding iust beneath its seemingly simple premise. The 
1'iise n-.Juction premise serves as an excellent skin Or "viral 
shell" for some other very important considerations or cultur- 
al ideologies, which have been coined "memes" by Richard 
Dawkins. an amazingly intelligent and communicative evolu- 
uonary scicnbfic writer/researcher. 

First of all. I have to point out thai while 1 was in Europe 
many years ago. the cost of gasoline (which most Europeans 
call "petrol") was already almost three limes more than here. 
From what I've read and been (old. most of the rest of the 
world is the same way. 1 won't try to get into why we. as 
Americans, gel so mucb better prices to begin with because 
that's another discussion entirely and doesn'l make a whole lot 
ol sinsc to me anyway. The main result of high prices ol gas 
in Europe (Germany specifically, because that was where 1 
was able lo sec firsthand) was considerably lower consump- 
tion in general of oil-based products such as gas and plastics. 
I lii ■■ vi.nei.il aim was apparently achieved (although mandated 
by high costs) by very effective and popular mass transit sys- 
tems, common use motorcycles and mopeds. heavy restric- 
tions on which refuse can be thrown away and large-scale 
state- sponsored recycling programs Also, ihe general layouts 
of the rural and urban countryside promoted use of these facil- 
ities, as well as the prevalence of bicycling and walking. 



Aside from those things, 1 have also noticed, even on Ihe 
Autobahn, the minimal presence of massive and inefficient 
personal vehicles. They didni drive fadill.ics. l.incolns. gas- 
guzzling "boats" or especially SUVs, It was almost nothing 
but VW Golf. Ford Escort and Toyota Corolla sized cars 
geared for efficiency and reliability, rather than power and 
prestige. 

So possibly, one of ihe underlying memes of the "Gas 
Out" issue is focusing our often short-spanned and distracted 
attention on our own flagrant over-cons limp do n. Perhaps it's 
tune we stopped worrying so much about how much we're 
paying for our gas, instead of how mucb of die Stuff we're 
needlessly expending. (Not to mention pollution-at least 
presently.) 

Lastly, on another level, we should really take into con- 
sideration thai its not just important whether die "Gas Out" 
works (as it apparently did tint last year! hul maybe more so. 
how it works. As one person whose comments I read on an 
electronic bulletin board (BD) staled, this should be looked at 
as an "exercise in community voice-building! " We're starting 
to leam how lo exploit the dynamics of a very complex or 
"chaotic informalron network," called the "datasphcre" by 
some. In [his age of communication, we'd all do well I o 
remember the words, of one of our greatest modem day media 
analysis. Marshal McLuhan: "The medium is the message." In 
this case, the medium amounts to every available channel for 
the dissemination of informauon Staled at its simplest: "Unite 
and spread the word. We need lo talk aboul II." 

As a final note. I would like lo mention an oversight 
which was pointed out to me after 1 had written this article. 
Not only do high crude od prices affect the price of gas, but 
they also greatly affect the cost required lo heat our homes, 
businesses and schools 1 suppose thai wc usually take these 
things for granted since we pay n bill for these services, but 
never actually go to Ihe store lo puichase our heating fuel. I 
have Eoliced ■ steady increase in my electric and heal bills as 
of late, which I attributed more to winter than oil prices. 
Thanks go lo my mother for pointing oul an aspect I previous- 
ly had missed in my examination or the issues. If you have fur- 
ther insights to lend please communicate them.

Venezuela and Fort Wayne: Two homes for one fellow student 



by Kerrin Langford, 
Staff Writer 



Carlos Lugo is a sophomore 
at IPFW majoring in robolic 
engineering lie is from Vcntaucl.i. 
a country slightly larger man Texas 
Venezuela is a land of lie hijthiru 
mountains and tallest waterfalls. In 
striking tonirasi in toe tropical land 
in northern South America is the 
climate of Fori Wayne, Lugo's 
home In \enc7.ucla, one can see die 
rainy season last from May to 
November, and (eel the waimih 
range between 70-85 degrees year 

In order Tor Lugo to come 
here, he had to be one of the top five 
students in bis high school. In 
Venezuela, public education is only 
rajuued between 7-H years of age. 
'I have been here for tv.o years." 
said Lugo 

The first thing Lugo noticed 
was a difference between the atti- 



if Venezuelans and 
i. He said an example of 
this would be in terms of bow 
strangers are treated. "Strangers are 
not treated (be same here as Ihey 
are in my country," said Lugo. 
"Here ii seems people are nervous 
and don'l want to be too friendly or 

"I also noticed (here was not as 
much to do in Fort Wayne," said 
Lugo, According to "Culture 
Grams." an ongoing cultural 
research eollcciion, Venezuela is a 
culture known to parly a great deal. 
The publicilion also says there is no 
age limit on alcohol. Venezuelans 
have a reputation of having an airof 
spontaneity, commonly bringing a 
party-like atmosphere with them. 

"Culture Grams" also slates 
that Venezuela is also known 10 care 
a greal deal about appearance. Lugo 
purchased a SI 200 suii righi before 
visiting bis parents in December &amp;"' 
However, Lugo losi the suit in [he Toe 

flood of December 15. No mailer different 
what Ihc class difference is in demands 
Venezuela, one musl always look his pretests 




Lugo. In addition, schedules arc 
system is also kepidiffereiilly."Ifaclassstansal8

"Here (hey give a lot of around lo gelling started unUI 10 
r second chances." said a.m.," said Logo. 



differ in his country compared to 
Fon Wayne, Lugo said, "1 notice 
when I leave a class (al IPFW) early, 
evayone looks ai me funny." In 
Venezuela, Ihe joy of an event or 
demand of an individual is more 
Importani than a schedule. 

Like education, marriage in 
Lugo's culture is a one-time thing 
and there are no pretests. "You are 
either bad or good ai it, but il is not 
ended as a result of being bad," said 
Lugo. 

Discrimination is also different 
in Lugo's country. "In my country, 
discrimination is based on money or 
class differences," said Lugo. "Here 
il is based on language and skin 
color." Although ai first il was hard 
for Lugo, he has made many good 
friends. Aside from Lugo experienc- 
ing negative looks when be speaks 
Spanish, be eiudes a positive out- 
look on life. 

"Family is very important in 
our culture,' said Lugo. In Lugo's 
culture, they depend on seeing each 
other every weekend, whether 50 



miles a more apart In terms of fam- 
ily. Lugo said, "Elderly are always 
welcome tq live in the primary fam- 
ily, regardless of bow much money 
die primary family makes." 

Religious preference In 
Venezuela is. predominantly 
Calholic. However. Lugo allends 
Calvary Temple in Fort Wayne. 
Tbey have been so helpful lo peo- 
ple in my country due lo the disaster 
flood," said Lugo, 

"At least 2000 pounds of 
clothes and bed sheets have been 
donated." said Lugo. 

Usually holidays are o very 
importani time to pony. Lugo was 
planning lo parly on the beach on 
Dee. 15. 1999, however, a flood 
look the life of Lugo's best friend. 
Instead of having a Christmas, Lugo 
helped bis church put together an 
effort lo help his country Although 
Lugo still finds it bard to sleep at 
night, he hopes to have the strength 
to conquer ihe inevitable fear that 
will surround him the next lime be 
visits his parents in Venezuela. 



'Scream 3' does not liue up to its predecessors

Obviously, the film is a 
teenage slasher flick. Not only do 
respected actors and attractive 
Playmates get butchered, a head 
rolls, a fire engulfs and some other 
victims have their last supper 
Benihana style. The production, 
which actually prides itself in being 
and spoofing a cliche-filled horror 
flick, also uses flickering candle 
lighl, bullet-proof vests, nightmares 
and who could forget, a finale in ihe 
dark. 

Those of you not already 
acquainted wiih "Scream" and 
"Scream 2" will likely find Utile

ence. We can all use a laugh every 



while I 






. So. I introduce 
to you the adventures of Jessica 
and Malissa 

For this year's spring break 
trip, a friend and I decided to go 
to Indianapobs for a couple of 
days. True, Indianapolis is not 
Uiai big of a vacaiion trip and il 
does not eiaclly beat our trip to 
ibe Bahamas list year, bul we 
wanted to al least say lhat we got 
to leave Ok city of Fan Wayne 
for our spring break. 

My friend. Jessica, and 1 left 
Sunday afternoon, traveling 
down 1-469 with the 









I had our tmsly 
atlas 10 guide us along the way 
and Vanilla Ice blaring in ibe car. 
One may ask why we bad an atlas 
Indianapolis. Well, for 



Ccnire Mall and walk to our 
hotel. The Crowne Plaza Haiti 

The Crowne Plaza Hotel is 
in ibe old Union Station nen to 
the RCA Dome. The Crowne 
Plaza Hotel is very classy and we 
felt special staying there. The 
hotel is two sinries, wilh the train 
cars from Union Station still in 
their original span. Actually, they 
have turned the trains into rooms 
where visitors can also stay. 

They have also broughi 
along ihe white statues thai are 
said to be the ghosts of the people 
who used lo ride the trains. When 
Jessica and I got off the elevators 
one lime, someone had moved the 
statue right in front, so when the 
doors opened he was standing 
right mere. The from desk cleric 
lotd us thai people move (he stat- 
ues all (be time. Of course Jessica 
and I decided to move some of 
ihe statues ourselves and have 
some fun witb (hem. Hey, if oth- 
ers were doing i(. why couldn't 

We eventually did move our 
cat. The nice front desk clerk 
informed us lhal the parking

about il now and thai is why wc

Jusl to lei everyone know, 
we did nol get lost on (be way 
down lo Indianapolis. We made it 
(here with no problems. Yeah fot

wc had lo park our car in (be

We : 






unloaded all of our belongings 
thai wc were taking with us into 
(he hotel. Wc did not pack lightly, 
cither. We had (o go around all of

hotel The construction really was 
(he only bad thing about the hotel. 
One of (be best pans of the hotel 
was lhat il was located within 
walking distance from (he Circle 
Centre Mall and restaurants. 

On Sunday night, we decid-

Planet Hollywood and cat. Jessica 
called (o make reservations, but 
(he number was disconnec(ed, 
which wc ihougbi was odd. 
Jessica and I walked down there 
before I remembered lhat Planet 
Hollywood had closed. We ihcn 
decided 10 go to the Hard Rock 



Cafe for dinner The food and (he

great time watching music videos 
and singing "Happy Binhday" to 
customers lhat ihe employees bad

We went back lo our hotel

The Beach' sinks in the sand 



by Malissa Fritz, 
Features Editor 



"The Beach" represents a 
reunion of director Danny Boyle, 
producer Andrew Macdonald and 
screenwriter John Hodge. Missing is 
star Ewan McGregor, but be has 
been replaced by none other than 
Leonardo DiCaprio, in his fini posi- 
"Ti (attic" role. Sadly, while 
DiCaprio does a credible job as the 
proiagonisl and "The Beach" repre- 

i great piece of eye candy, this 



cracked up to be 



or 



film, a 



whf.L-.i 



"The Beach" is divided into 
iwo sections. The first, which corn- 
prises (wo- (birds of ihc running 
lime, is a fairly straigh (forward 
adventure/romance. It's all very 
"Blue Lagoon"-ish, wilh ihc flora 
and fauna consiMeml)* overshadow- 
ing ihe paper-thin characters Even a 
sdly rubber shark has more person- 
ality than half the men and women 
populating this movie. However, 
after (he protracied, rather pjencm: 
beginning, "Ihe Beach" pulls an 
"Apocalypse Now" and plunges into 
iriL-hcrenee The last JO minuies 
weren't merely d is salis lying, they're 
virtually unbearable And, in the 
end, il all seems io signify nothing. 

The movie opens in Bangkok, 
where Richard (DiCaprio) has 
arrived from America. In hi* -tcdy 
hotel, be meets his neighbors To his 
nghi arc a young French couple, 
L-ticnne (Guilhumc Caneti and 
Francois (Virginie Ledoyen) To his 
left is a manic Scotsman, Daffy 
(Robert Cailylc), who docs his best 
lo live up lohls name Btfvu. -Ii.nu 
open his wrisls. Daffy gives Richard 
a map lo paradise-a pcrtccl beach 
surrounding a lagoon on an island 
(hat no one visits. Along witb 
Eliennc and Francois, Riclcinl l-'-cs 
In search of this place and. afier 
braving several perils, finds the 
small, multi-racial communily 
established (here. Led by Sal (Tilda 
Swinlon). they are a hack-io-iLiiure 
group who have given up civiliza- 
tion io live in peace and seclusion 
Richard and his two friends arc 
almost immediately accepted inio 

lilt tuni'K'J'.ili"!! I'UI ill'.-, p? r ... In .ill \ 

learn lhal no paradise is all dial ii ls 



Beach's" tunning time is devoted to 
Ihc lifeless romance between 
Richard and Francois. First, the 
hunky young American has to win 
the g iri from her French boyfriend 
(nol much of a challenge there con- 
sidering how wimpy Euctme turns 
out to be), ihcn he has io develop 
somelhing meaningful wilh her. 
However, while DiCaprio and 
Ledoyen look great together, there's 
no chemistry or heal. Passion docs 
nol simmer, il sputters For the most 
pan. with all of the glorious tropical 
backdrops for ihcm (o frolic in from 
or, ihese (wo look like (hey arc pos- 
ing for travel magazine layouts. 

To say lhat the ending is con- 
fusing is a bit of an understalcmenl 
Wilh lilitc provocation and less 
motivation. Richard's character goes 
off the deep end. He turns inlo some 
kind of wild man and runs off into 
Ihe woods (o track a quartet of 
tourisis who have come to (he island 
as a result of a mistake Richard 
made (he copied Dalty's map and 
gave it to someone else). He has 
nightmarish visions of Daffy and 

game, bul ii's never clear whal all 
this is about. Even less cn*dible is 
how a sudden shock manages lo 
fully restore Richard io his senses 
This isn't character building, it's 
character demolition. And. initn- 



IHTLllly in 



. the final scene is 
"Titanic." lhal we end up looking for 



supporting characters. Sal 
comes (be closest to developing a 
real personality; it's not ihe actress' 
fault dial she falls short. Finally. 
Robert Cariyle does what he does 
bat-troths al the mouth given half a 
chance. Fortunalcly. he's not inmost 
of (he film 

For anyone wiih enough 
patience (o look, (here are Ihcmes (o 
be found here. There's some heavy- 
duty Biblical stuff going on-even (o 
the point where Richard drinks a 
snake's blood. "The Beach" is about 
the elusiveness or Paradise and how 
the basic budding blocks of human 
nature will poLson what is seemingly 
pcrfeci. There's also ihe rather vapid 
message lhal grcal beamy often 
holds great danger. Considering 
Toe Beach's" strong, pre-ccotogi- 
cal underpinning, it is ironic lhal 
charges of ruining some of (he pris- 
tine locales where filming look 
place were leveled against ihe pro- 
duction. 

In (he director's chair, Boyle 
never seemed lo hii his siride His 
prtv urns films have been offbeaf and

misses ihe mark and ends up mired 
in chaos. Aside from Ihe video game 
sequences. Boyle rarely tries any- 
thing innovaiive. Apparently, 
he quarreled wilh Fox about (he 
Rim's direction and although he won
