Tutoring on campus 
free to students with 
academic problems 



By TOMMY FRANKE 

"We want to help students who 
are in real academic stress." With 
these words, Jean Tyler, one of the 
two associate directors of the 
Tutorial-Study Skills Center, summed 
up the goals for this office. 

The center is funded by the Office 
of Veteran Affairs and offers free 
tutoring to all Indiana-Purdue stu- 
dents. In addition, it provides free 
tutoring referrals for the community. 

Ward Ruple, head of Veterans 
Affairs office, is in charge of the 
program. Obie Booker, assistant to 
the director. Famious Williams, the 
other associate director of the 
tutoring program, and Miss Tyler, 
assist Ruple. 

The tutoring program has been in 
existence since the middle of last 
November- Over 90 students have 
been tutored through this program 
this semester. 

Miss Tyler said that most of the 
students who used the tutoring 
service commented favorably about 
the center. 

"We are not just a supervised 
study hall where we do homework for 
students. Our goals are to provide 



particular academic problem.' 

She added, "We are never going 
to replace regular hours ot studying. 

"We exist tor aiding the student 
who really wants to make it. She 
noted that students who expect real 
help from the tutoring must have 
motivation to work harder than their 
classmates." 

Miss Tyler and Williams head a 
staff of 16 part-time tutors, all of 
whom are students. 

While training for the tutors is 
done mostly on an informal discussion 
basis, "We are blessed with a bunch 
of really talented tutors. 

"Most of our tutors are recom- 
mended by the heads of the depart- 
ment that they are majoring in as not 
only being proficient in the subject 
matter, but also being able to 
communicate their subject matter to 

Dave Fleckenstein, one of the 
tutors in the program, said that this 
job has encouraged him to consider 
teaching physics, his major. 

"I think that I'd like to go into a 
university situation after I finish my 
graduate work. I enjoy research and I 
enjoy teaching. 

"Many times in my tutoring I just 
acquaint the Tutees with material 
already available to them. For 



example, when a student not familiar 
with mathematics takes a calculus 
course, he may not even know that 
there are reference tables, charts and 
indexes in his text to help him study." 

He added that many times he just 
helps a student improve his basic 
study skills. 

In explaining more about the 
tutoring program, Miss Tyler, who is 
also a part-time English composition 



"When we set up this program, we 
tried to cover all the academic areas. 
The only areas that we have not been 
able to assist students in so far this 
semester have been accounting and 
music theory." 

She said that in a situation where 
they have no tutors to help a student 
in a particular area, they contact the 
instructor or the department head 
and they usually help the studen' out

IWffl. 



The tutoring office hours are 9:00 
a.m. until 5:00 p.m. However, tutors 
are available in the evening hours. 

Most tutoring is done by appoint- 
ment, with Williams and Miss Tyler 
coordinating the schedules of the 
tutors and the tutees. 

The tutoring program works 
closely with Ruple and the Counseling 
and Academic Development Division. 



About unification 



Steering committee 
to question presidents 



The Ad Hoc Joint Faculty 
Steering Committee (ADJFSC) drew 
up a list of questions to ask the two 
university presidents and, as might 
be expected, the role of the new 
business manager figured prominent- 
ly in these question. 

The questions will be the basis of 
the agenda for an open hearing to be 



President Arthur Hansen will attend 
the hearing to answer the commit- 
tee's questions. 

The committee expressed con- 
cern over the ambiguity of the role of 
the IU-PU business manager upon 
unification. According to the super- 
chancellor agreement, the business 
manager will report to the chancellor 
and to the Purdue Vice President and 
Treasurer. 

The committee will ask the 
presidents to distinguish between the 
types of matters that the business 
manager will be responsible to the 
: affairs for

Forum sponsored 

The University Religious Forum 
and the Students for a Free Society 
will sponsor a special Folk School 
program in the Student Union at 1:00 
p.m. February 26. 

A jazz band. Smoke, and a 
discussion on "Why Students Don't 
Think," will be featured. Folk School 
director Terry Doran will tell 



SPEA to come 
to IU-PU 
after all 

The past conflicts which excluded 
the School of Public and Environmen- 
tal Affairs from the Fort Wayne 
campus have been resolved according 
to I.U. officials in Fort Wayne and 
Bloomington. 

Charles F. Bonser, dean of the 
School of Public and Environmental 
Affairs (SPEA) in Bloomington, said 
Tuesday. "The most recent conflict 
had been over the funding of the 
school on the Fort Wayne Campus." 
Bonser stated that he sent a letter to 
Ralph E. Broyles, chancellor, stating 
that SPEA in Bloomington will be 
able to cover part of the costs on the 
Fort Wayne campus. The dean 
further stated that in the past, due to 
budget problems on the Bloomington 
Campus, SPEA was not able to come 
through with the funds. 



the hands of the business office as it is 
now on the Purdue side?" asked 
Richard Desmond, I.U. dean of 
faculties and AHJFSC co-chairman. 

Desmond said that I.U. has more 
freedom in determining budget guide- 
lines than Purdue, where the guide- 
lines are set by the business office. 

Committee members wondered 
what role the business manager 
would play in formulating fiscal 
policies for the merged campus. 

The committee will also ask the 
presidents about a merged faculty 
and a single IU-PU curriculum. 

"Are the presidents pre-disposed 
to either a single or dual faculty?" 
asked Jay Abromowitz. "Are they 
willing to accept i 



"Can we meld our programs and 



courses together or do they want us to 
keep missions?" asked Desmond. 

Missions refer to the agreement 
between the two institutions that 
divide academic programs between 
them. The university with a particu- 
lar mission hires all the faculty and 
grants all the degrees in that area. 

Other topics to be discussed at the 
hearing include payments to the 
central systems for services. At 
present, a portion of the campus 
budget is retained by the main 
campuses to pay for the use of these 



reduced. Others indicated that 
would be better for IU-PU if the 
campus could negotiate for those 
services that it actually needs. 



Local group proposes 
Ft. Wayne public t.v. 



Wallace Fosnight, president of 
Fort Wayne Public Television, Inc. 
announced a plan to bring public 
television service to Fort Wayne. 

Fort Wayne Public Television, a 
not-for-profit corporation, proposes to 
translate station WBGU-TV, a public 
television station from Bowling 
Green, Ohio, into the Fort Wayne area 



and Federal Communication!; Com- 
mission approval the proposed ser- 
vice would provide a non-commercial 
TV channel for approximately 90,000 
households. Citizens could watch a 
wide range of children's television, 
cultural, educational and public 
affairs programs and many other 
entertainment and educational offer- 
ings that Fort Wayne viewers are not 
now able to receive. 

The proposed translator antenna 
will be located on a tower to be 
constructed by Fort Wayne Public 
Television on land optioned off the 
Goshen Road near Franke Park. 
Pending FCC approval of a proposed 
FM station, Weber Broadcasting has 



agreed to a 
partial tower c 

The plan to translate WBGU-TV 
is viewed as a first step toward 
planning for the future of public 
television in Fort Wayne. The cost of 
the translator project and research- 
ing future alternatives is approxi- 
mately $63,900. It is possible that 
$20,500 could be recovered through 
the tower joint use arrangement with 
Weber Broadcasting. 

Other officers and members of 
the Board of Fort Wayne Public 
Television, Inc. include Suzanne Hall, 
Julia Oldenkamp and James Prickett. 
Alan Kent and Walter Dean have 
assisted with the proposed translator 
project. Graham Richard, education- 
al consultant, has been retained to 
coordinate the translator project and 
initiate research for future planning 
and development of public television 
for Fort Wayne. 

Citizens interested in assisting 
with the fund raising campaign 
should contact Wallace Fosnight at 
742-8121 or 493-1446 or Graham 
Richard at 422-9736. 



' 




Bonser also stated that other 
problems that were resolved last July 
concerned the governing of SPEA on 
the Fort Wayne Campus. One 
example, according to the Keenan 
Report, a study concerning the dual 
administration of IU-PU, stated that 
the regional campus faculty feared 
dominance by the deans from 
Bloomington. Bonser said that all he 
had been trying to do at the time was 
develop a program in Fort Wayne, a 
city that he felt should have top 
priority. 

He elaborated by stating he gave 
the faculty senate his proposals and 
they gave him theirs from which both 
parties were able to work out an 
agreement. According to Bonser, the 
agreement states that the Fort Wayne 
campus will set up a committee that 
will do the screening, hiring and firing 
of faculty members subject to final 
approval by him and Chancellor 
Broyles of the I.U. division of IU-PU. 

According to faculty members of 
the divisions of arts and business, the 
reasons why SPEA was not accepted 
at that time was that funds were not 
forthcoming from Bloomington. Con- 
sequently, faculty members of the

Search and screen 

A short time ago the Chancellor Search and Screen Committee was 
•'reminded" by the IU-PU chapter of the American Federation of 
Teachers of its position on certain super-chancellor related issues. One 
such issue is a faculty referendum on the acceptability of the candidates 
nominated by the committee. 

The AFT would like the list of names under final consideration to be 
submitted to the faculty for approval. This apparently means that the 
AFT resolves to give the faculty veto power over the super-chancellor 
committee. , 

What the AFT wants appears to be this: When you have a semi-final 
list of namer, give it to the faculty, who will tell you which names are 
acceptable for further consideration. 

What the AFT is asking is that the committee strip itself of what little 
power it has been given. 

The Chancellor Search and Screen Committee was created by the two 
university presidents to advise them on appointing a super-chancellor for 
IU-PU. To make this advice as valuable as possible, the presidents 
composed the committee of faculty, student, and community leaders. 

Yes, we all know that the committee turned out to have no clerical 
and staff members, no blacks, and even no AFT members. But each 
constituency had significant input into the selection of its 
representatives. The Purdue faculty members were elected by popular 
vote. 

It is important to remember what the committee is supposed to do. It 
is to search for and screen applicants for the job, as a service to the 
presidents. Presumably the super-chancellor will be chosen from the list 
of five or so that the committee forwards to the two presidents. 

There are faculty members on this committee to represent faculty 
interests in the selection process. A faculty vote undermines the 
responsibility of these professors who have been (s)elected to do what a 
popular vote will not allow them to do. 

Many think that the committee is a front to legitimize a choice that 
already has been made by the two presidents. A faculty referendum 
would make the committee a front for a popularity contest. 

Does it matter whether the committee is emasculated from the top or 
from the bottom? 

It is time that we all get off the committee's back so that it can get its 
job done as quickly as possible. 



Thanks 



We would like to extend our thanks to the l.U. Allen County Alumni 
Club, Souder's Home Center, and Variety Theatres. All three contributed 
money to Indiana-Purdue Student Newspapers, Inc., to help us pay off 
our $10,000 debt. 

We still have a substantial portion of that debt left, but future 
prospects look good. If things go as well as they have gone the past couple 
of weeks, the Communicator may be around for a long time.

Cyanide bullets 
and kidnapping 



Editor's Note: A team 0/ report- 
ers has spent several weeks Investi- 
gating California and nationwide 
revolutionary organizations. One of 
these organizations is the Symblonese 
Liberation Army, a group that claims 
responsibility for the kidnaping of 
Patricia Heart. Following is the first 
of three articles discussing the 
operations of such organizations. 

By COPLEY NEWS SERVICE 

SAN FRANCISCO - Black 
commandos kidnaped the grand- 
daughter of the late newspaper 
publisher William Randolph Hearst 
Feb. 4. 

Bullets laced with cyanide slam- 
med into the body of Dr. Marcus 
Foster last November, ending the life 
of one of the nation's most respected 
black educators. 

The kidnaping of Patricia Hearst 
in Berkeley and the death of Foster in 
an Oakland. Calif., parking lot were 
said to be the work of the Symbionese 
Liberation Army (SLA), a revolution- 
ary group. 

The SLA, evidence shows, is 
linked to Venceremos, a Maoist group 
which aims at the overthrow of the 
U.S. government. 

H. Bruce Franklin, one of the 
organizers of the California-based 
Revolutionary Union and a leader of 
Venceremos when it split off from the 
Union in January, 1971, described it 
as a "diversified multinational revo- 
lutionary organization." 

Venceremos split from the Union 
over the question of armed struggle, 
with many Venceremos members 
urging an immediate armed revolu- 



e investigation into the 
murky world of the revolutionary, a 
world of plats, counterplots, murder 
and kidnaping, has led state and 
federal investigators to the conclusion 
that the majority of the revolutionary 
groups now doing business in the 
United States are joining together - 
many of them under the protective 
wing of Venceremos. 

Their purpose? To spark a 
revolution - NOW - in the United 
States. They believe that 1974 is the 
year when the United States, plagued 
by the energy crisis and other 
ills and drained by a long 

, can be brought tumbling down.

Sexism - Israeli style 



By AUDREY GELLIS 

The biggest upset of the recent 
Israeli election was the emergence of 
a militant feminist, Shulamit Aloni, 
as a political leader to be reckoned 
with. Ms. Aloni not only won a seat for 
herself in Parliament, but carried in 
two other members of her embryonic 
Civil Rights Party. 

Yet to anyone familiar with the 
Israeli political scene, Ms. Aloni's 
victory was anything but a surprise. 
The Yom Kippur War had interrupted 
a budding feminist movement - a 
movement which was temporarily 
shelved as the tiny nation closed 
ranks to deal with the threat to its 
survival. 

Just two weeks before the onset of 
war, I had interviewed Dr. Dorit 
Padan-Eisenstark, an Israeli sociolo- 
gist, college professor and feminist, 
who had come to this country to 
shatter the myth of Israeli sexual 
equality and to enlist the aid of 
American Jewry in breaking the 
stranglehold of the Orthodox rabbi- 
nate on Israeli marriage laws - laws 
which discriminate against women. 

Dr. Eisenstark emphasized that 
despite the image of equality project- 
ed by a woman prime minister. 
statistically, there is no difference in 
the employment pattern between 
Israel and other industrialized na- 
tions. Israeli women are predomi- 
nantly occupied in teaching, nursing, 
clerical and sales occupations, and 
with the exception of medicine, are 
underrepresented in all managerial 
and high-status professions. 

Even the much-touted picture of 
Israeli women fighting side by side 
with their men is dismissed as 



window dressing by Dr. Eisenstark. 
While Israeli women are, like men, 
subject to compulsory military ser- 
vice and while the army does give 
them some feeling of contributing to 
their country's defense, their contri- 
bution is limited mainly to that of the 
secretary or switchboard operator. 

According to Dr. Eisenstark, sex 
discrimination in Israel does not take 
the blatant and overt form it does in 
the United States but is what she calls 
"underground discrimination." Is- 
raeli girls are discouraged from 
achieving by the same socialization 
that conditions women throughout the 
world into believing their only proper 






3 wife and mother. 



"This is a Jewish community," 
she adds, "and Jews are very 
concerned with marriage. Pressure 
on young girls to get married is very 
great." (Dr. Eisenstark is not anti- 
marriage; in addition to her profess- 
ional life, she is the chic, attractive 
mother of three. ) 

However, the issue that has most 
galvanized Israeli women is the 
control the Orthodox rabbinate exer- 
cises, over marriage, divorce and 
related matters of personal status. 
This despite the fact most Israelis are 
secular in life-style. ' 'The moment we 
are not limited by the religious, we 
have the most advanced laws," Dr. 
Eisenstark complained. 

Marriage laws, however, go back 
some 3,000 years and are enforced by 
rabbinical courts. Conservative and 
reform rabbis are not recognized. 
There is no civil marriage. .1 Jew 
wishing to marry a non-Jew (or trying 
to avoid other archaic marriage laws) 
leaves the country (generally for 
Cyprus) for the marriage ceremony. 



While marriage laws can be 
circumvented, divorce laws cannot. ■ 
Divorce where the two parties 
mutually consent is not a problem. 
But, according to rabbinic law, no 
wife can get a divorce without her 
husband's written permission (even 



without his wife's consent. The 
government tries to get around this by 
jailing a husband until he agrees to 
the divorce granted by a rabbinical 



unmarried brother or be "released"; 
by him (in a ceremony which is 
humiliating to both). Most men 
routinely "release" their sisters-in- 
law, but there are cases of men who 
make the widow pay for her freedom. 
The Orthodox rabbis are able to 
1 their power partly through 
that if the Israelis 
abandoned old ways, they would lose 
the support of American Jewry. 
Ironically, the very opposite is true; 
most American Jews have never been 
near a rabbinical court, are secretly 
embarrassed by Israel's state-syna- 
gogue connection, yet are reluctant to 
raise an issue that would give this 
beleagured country yet another 

However, Israelis like Dr. Eisen- 
stark feel the issue should be faced 
openly. If American Jews - upon 
whom Israel is so dependent - let it be 
known they oppose theocratic laws, 
the power of the Orthodox minority 
could be broken. Such a move would 
be truly consistent with Israeli 
tradition - the dream of social justice 
envisioned by her founders.

Education - Russian style 



"Something emphatically wrong' 



By RICHARD SOKOLOWSKI 

A young Komsomol came to see 
comrade Solovov. distinguished, edu- 
cated, prominent writer on youth 
topics, twice decorated with the order 
of Lenin and presently political 
counselor to the famous Moscow High 
School.

To the Editor: 

After reading the article in the 
newspaper about how APO fell short 
of its goal for donors, I threw down the 
newspaper in disgust. I can't believe 
the rotten attitude of our student body 
to stay out of all activities that call for 
involvement on their part. After all 
the advertising and work put into the 
blood drive, I can't believe there 
wasn't more participation. And on top 
of it, of the 110 people who had 
committed themselves, it's ironic 
only 54 of them showed. I must 
commend those 54. though, and the 
other 44 who donated on impulse. All 



While I'm on the subject of 
involvement, I must also remark on 
the outcome of the M.S. Marathon. 
Circle K should be patted on the back 
for trying to do something so 
unselfish and worthwhile for someone 
else. After ail their efforts, it's just too 
bad they didn't get enough enthusi- 
asm from the student body. But then,

GHAVKS' PRESIDENT THE DUMBEST 

OF ASSES 

Honorable William Bartholomay : 

Sometimes you just get that gut-level 

feeling that you've got to go out and do 

something brilliant, don't you Bill? And the 

feeling is so good when it's finally all over, 

and you can sit back and relax in your 

i and realize that you've at last 

i genuine self-actualized human 

being. Isn't that right, Bill? 

You jerk. 

Just when sports fans across the nation 
begin anticipating the upcoming baseball 
[i and the great record-smashing feat 
that Henry is sure to accomplish, you, the 
esteemed president of Henry's ball club, go 
/the whole thing up but good. 
Now, at Cincinnati's Riverfront Stad- 
ium on April 4th, one of the sport's greatest 
superstars of all time is going to hear a lot 
mixed in with the inevitable cheers. 

He's going to have "Go home, nigger!" 
(and other things compoundedly worse) 
ringing in his ears after his first visit to 
Shea Stadium this year. 

And the great Henry Aaron just does 
not deserve any such fate! Mr. Bartholo- 
may, sir, how could you ever do such a 
fiendish thing? 

Did you forget to take your pill on that 
day last week when you babbled: "Henry 
starter for the Braves in 
the opening series in Cincinnati, April 4-7. 
He will first start on April 8 when the 
Atlanta Braves will host the Los Angeles 
Dodgers"? 

Did you not once pause to consider the 
consequences of your move? The Boston 
Globe: "contriving of the most blatant sort, 
an unabashed pitch for a 'controlled' TV, a 
prepared package." 

The Indianapolis Star: "No wonder 



become the national joke.' 



nel 



getting 



shortchanged." 

And even the Atlanta Journal: "He's 
not a freak. He's still the best player the 
Braves have. He should be playing in 
Cincinnati. Without him in the lineup they 
have a good chance of coming home 0-3. 
The Braves should just let the record 
happen. They shouldn't sacrifice the whole 
season for Henry Aaron." 

So Henry has been forced into a 
situation which should never have arisen. 
Reporters have been hounding him the past 
several days, asking him if he is 
considering a starting role in Cincinnati 



But Henry is in a tight, tight spot. What 
should he say, what could he say? 

"I'd rather get criticism in New York 
than in my home town. I can take.it there. 
We don't go there but a couple of times a 
year." And even more lamely: "What the 
heck. You have to look at it from the 
financial standpoint of the Braves. And, 
besides, I haven't been doing too well early 
in the season for the past five years or so." 

But oh Henry! A bad Henry is still 
better than almost anybody else in the 
game! Everyone would like to see you 
smash those magic roundtrippers. You are 
not only loved in Atlanta but in Los 
Angeles, Chicago, Cincinnati, and Pitts- 
burgh as well! At least you were until Bill's 
magnificent blunder. 

Hank Aaron will never be loved like the 
Babe. For one thing, he's as black as the 
ace of spades. And he is moving into 
territory strictly reserved for the "superior 



But, Bill, isn't it ironic that a spoiled 
white boy should inadvertently blow the 
whole deal for a black boy who put him 
where he is today?
