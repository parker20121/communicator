INDIANA - PURDUE COMMUNICATOR 






INDIANA-PURDUE UNIVERSITY, FORT WAYNE, INDIANA 




Late Wednesday afternoon this accident took place on the curve next to Trom 3. 
Involved in the accident was the driver of a '72 Vega, William Wehremberg, of 2404 
4th Park Blvd., Fort Wayne, and the driver of a '70 Impala, Lou Waldron, 1530 South 
Park Drive, New Haven. Miss Waldron and her passenger. Rose Mary Gaskill, were 
taken to the hospital for minor injuries. Wehremberg was not injured in the accident. 
Another traffic accident occurred on campus early Monday morning involving two 
cars near the Student Union. Icy driving conditions were considered the cause of the 
collision, according to Earl Warnock, chief of safety and security. 



24-hour M. S. Marathon 
begins Friday at noon 



Many people in this community 
are donating 24 hours out of their 
schedules for what they feel is a 
worthy cause: the research of 
multiple sclerosis. At noon tomorrow, 
February 1, 1974, the Multiple 
Sclerosis Marathon will begin here at 
Indiana-Purdue. 

Ivan Lebamoff, mayor of Fort 
Wayne, will be presiding over the 
opening ceremonies. 

The 24-hour marathon is being 
sponsored by Circle K, a service 
organization on campus, to help raise 
money for the Indiana Multiple 
Sclerosis Foundation. 

Money raised in this endeavor 
will go for research. At this time, 
there is no known cure for M.S. and 
the cause has not yet been discovered. 
It usually attacks people between the 
ages of 18 and 45. 

Circle K has asked for the 
cooperation and involvement of the 
entire student body at Indiana- 
Purdue, according to Jim Adams, 
Circle K president. "It is up to the 
students and the community to 
respond to this to make it really 
successful." 

So far, many groups are getting 
involved in order to raise money. 

WKJG, WPTA and WANE-TV 
local television stations will be 
broadcasting during the marathon to 



keep the public informed of the events 
of the Marathon. 

Several fire department posts will

Scouts will be assisting Circle K with 
the Marathon. Also helping will be the 
Key Clubs from Bishop Luers and 
Bishop Dwenger High Schools. Sever- 
al high schools have been collecting 
donations at basketball games.

Meeks announces Chairman Andrew Harper sees music 
Sheriff candidacy department grow, expand programs 



Charles "Bud" Meeks announ ced 
Tuesday that he will seek election on 
the Republican ticket for the office of 
Sneriff of Allen County. 

In announcing his candidacy, 
Meeks stated some of the issues he 
feels are facing the people of Allen 
County with regard to the office of 
Sheriff: 

-A maximum effort should be 
made to help expedite the acquisition 
of a Regional Rehabilitation Center 
and its pre-trial commitment facility. 

-Since 1960 the suburban popula- 
tion has increased 46 per cent and 
crime is rising at an alarming rate. 
This is due in part to the increased 
security and protection of the 
business establishments in the City of 
Fort Wayne, thereby forcing the 
criminal to the suburbs. 

-The problems of Narcotic and 
Drug addiction. The complexity of the 
problem of narcotic and drug 
addiction and its many faces demand 
that the Sheriff have expertise not 
only in Narcotic enforcement, but 
also his input into the rehabilitation of 
the user is very important. 

Meeks said that he feels he has 
the necessary qualifications and 
expertise to face and resolve these 
and many other complex problems 
with constructive ideas and programs 

Meeks, who resides with his wife 
and son Brian at 15026 North Tonkel 
Road is a native of Allen County, a 
graduate of Central High School, Fort 
Wayne, and a member of Prince of 
Peace Lutheran Church. 

He is presently serving as Senior 
Detective Sgt., Vice &amp; Narcotics, with 
the Allen County Sheriff's Depart- 



experience. He is a graduate of the 
Federal Bureau of Narcotics Training 
School, New York City, the Fderal 
Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous 
Drugs, Washington, D.C., and the 



He is also currently serving as 
President of the Allen County 
Republican Club and Campaign 
Chairman of the 1974 March of Dimes. 
He serves on the Board of Directors of. 
the Inter Agency Drug Abuse Council, 
and is Captain in the Air National 
Guard, Baer Field. 

Meeks is holder of the Silver Star 
Award, second highest honor on the 
Sheriff's Dept., also 1972 J.C. Out- 
standing Police Officer for the Allen 
County Sheriff's Dept., and 1973 



the Indiana

First undersea hotel 

Plans for the world's first 
undersea hotel have been announced 
by Hans Hass, Austrian sea expert, to 
be built off the coast of southern Spain 
near Almeria. 

There will be accommodations 
for up to 12 people in four adjoining 
circular compartments and guests 
will be admitted as part of a diving

COMMUNICATOR to use 
legal action to collect debt 



The Board of Directors of 
Indiana-Purdue Student Newspapers, 
Inc., publishing agent for the Corn- 



Purdue owes the Con 
$2,250 for free subscriptions over the 
past three months for campus activity 
card holders. The university also 
owes approximately ?500 for debts 
occuring prior to November 8, 1973. 

"I think it is assinine that the 
university has stalled so long on 
paying to the paper money that has 
been allocated by the Students' 
Government," said Kurt Ullman, 
vice-chairman of the board. "It is just 
another example of the administra- 



activity money." 

The Student Senate last Novem- 
ber allocated $225 per issue so that the 
Communicator would be free of 
charge. The payments were to start 
with the November 15 issue. 

Purdue's failure to pay its 
account has caused a number of 
payrolls to be missed, according to 
Business Manager Robert Hudson. 
Hudson said that January's two 
payrolls have been missed entirely. 

The board's resolution said that 
unless Purdue had made substantial 
progress in settling its account by 
February 1, the corporation^ lawyer 
would be asked to take whatever 
action he deems necessary to collect 
the account. 

The morion was made by Ullman 
and seconded by Professor Fred 
Kirchhoff. It passed the board 
unanimously.

When Dr. Andrew H. Harper, Jr., 
chairman of the music department, 
came to the Indiana-Purdue campus 
seven years ago, the music depart- 
ment at the university was nearly 
non-existent. 

It presently employs a half dozen 
full time professors, and nearly 25 
other part time music instructors. 

The music program is growing 
steadily, and Dr. Harper noted that he 



to the division of music at IU-PU i 
the near future. 

According to the departmental 
chairman, this program will be the 
only one of its kind in the state of 

It might set up a situation, as Dr. 
Harper described, "Where the stu- 
dents from Bloomington and other 
regional campuses in the state will 
take their first two years of classes in 
Bloomington tor their regional cam- 
pus city) and will have to come to 



Fort Wayne in order to fulfill the 
necessary requirements for a degree 
in music therapy." 

The primary characteristics of 
the new program involve volunteer 
work, and work by the students with 
mentally deficient children who are 
capable of enjoying music and the 
arts, but have never been given the 
opportunity. 

It is hoped by Dr. Harper that the 
mew proposed program will arouse a 
new interest in Fort Wayne's music 
iprogram, and that it will initiate a 
1 financial response that will allow the 
division of music to expand and 
improve to a greater extent. 

Presently, the department offers 
three different degrees in the music 
field. Dr. Harper explained, "What 
we're trying to do is to give the 
students an option. We do this 
basically by giving them the choice of 
three areas, and hopefully soon in the 
near future a fourth area." 

The Bachelor of Music degree is 
the most complex of the three degrees 
offered. It consists of individual areas 
of composition, orchestral instru- 
ment, organ, piano, piano accom- 
panying, theory, and voice. A degree 
in each of these areas takes four years 



Students take poll on use 
of Student Union Building 



By TOMMY FRANKE 

Dick Eckert and John Rohrer, 
two Indiana-Purdue students, have 
been conducting a survey on the 
attitudes of students, faculty, and 
staff toward the Student Union. 

Eckert is the assistant building 
deputy of the Union.and in his job has 



decided that he and Rohrer could u 
this survey as their class project for 
their Supervision course and, at the 
same time, organize some construc-

tried to keep the questions on the 
survey short and to the point." 

Sample question: "Do you think 



Approximately 1500 students

faculty and staff members have been 
randomly selected to complete the 



According to Eckert, the reac- 
tions to the Student Union voiced in 
the surveys that have been turned in 
at this time are generally favorable. 

"The general comments that 
have been added to the questions we 
asked are really turning out to be as 
valuable to us as the specific answers. 
For example, many people have 
commented on the cafeteria food and 
prices, on the size of the ping-pong 
room, the fact that no antennae was 
put on the building for the television. 
We plan to forward these comments 
to such people as Don Haver of the 
cafeteria." 

The deadline for filling out the 
surveys is February 4. After that, the 
data will be cross correlated by a 
computer. The students hope to have 
a full report compiled within two 
weeks.

the four years can be taken at the Fort 
Wayne Campus. 

A student can also major in Music 
Education. This degree involves the 
teaching profession. The degree is 
divided into areas of choral-general 
teaching, instrumental teaching, or 
general music teaching. 

In the final area a student can 
earn his credits in music and another 
subject as well. This program is given 
the degree name of Bachelor of 

Science in Music and an outside field.

Dr. Harper also acknowledged

students at Indiana-Purdue. The

Liberalism attempts mind control 



By JEFFREY ST. JOHN 



Athletic misrepresentation 

There appears to be no end to the unbelievable blunders of the Joint 
Athletic Committee. 

First it was their idea to charge admission to the missionless varsity 
basketball games. Now we find out that they passed a budget of 3,308 
dollars for a ten day "training" session at Jekyl Island, Georgia. 

This little jaunt down South will take place during spring break, 
which is timely since all the university vehicles will be at their disposal. 

Yes, sports fans, the 40 athletes and staff are driving university 
vehicles, which only confirms our convictions that Nixon's gas shortage 

The amount of money being used is not the real issue here. In fact, we 
doubt whether thai will suffice. Our concern is the committee that deals 
with the third of the student tax. 

For some unknown reason the Joint Athletic Committee is comprised 
of six faculty members and four students. The mere faculty to student 
ratio of the committee shows the blatent faculty control over student 
monies. Therein lies the unjust representation that the student body is 
receiving. 

One would tend to speculate as to where the check and balance come 
into play. When you have coaches and athletes controlling the money in 
the athletic fund you end up with no checks and a smaller balance. 

One of the planks in the ABC party headed by Brock Able was equal 
representation of the Joint Athletic Committee. Needless to say, that has 
gone by the wayside, which also proves where the real power on this 
campus does not lie. 

'Public' private parking 

If you wish to visit the new and quite beautiful Freimann Square this 
summer, you had better apply for a job at the City-County Building. 

You see, as citizens we get second dubbs on "public" land, and it 
seems thai city employees got tired of hoofing it from the city parking lot. 

So the city came in like a "thief in the night" and quietly confiscated 
half of the city public parking space in Freimann Square. 

One would wonder what Mr Freimann would have to say about the 
city's new "annex," or if it is even legal. But then it has been said that it is 
easier for a politician to make things legal than it is to make things 
legitimate. 

Perhaps we must consider ourselves lucky for the city leaving us any 
parking spaces at ?\\. We would have been highly discouraged if the city 
would have abused all of the public land. 

There are some possible solutions at hand that could solve this public 

First, the city employees could form car pools to cut down on the 
number of vehicles having to lake up parking space, 

Secondly, citizens desiring to visit Freimann Park could 
"confiscate" any vacant parking space reserved for a city employee. 

Another solution would be for the city to proclaim Freimann Park 
city property, and take over all of the parking spaces. 

But perhaps the best solution would be to dynamite the City-County 
Building and make a gigantic public parking lot for all of us good old

concede is that liberalism, stripped of 
its humanitarian mantle, is funda- 
mentally an attempt to control by 
government force both the body and 
the mind of men and women. 

In a series of columns in the next 
few weeks, I plan to prove this 
contention with the words of Amer- 
ica's two leading liberals: historian 
and presidential adviser Arthur M. 
Schlesinger Jr., and former senator 
and presidential candidate Eugene 
McCarthy. 

This columnist appeared with 
both in an hour-long debate on the 
premier TV discussion program, 
"The Open Mind," produced and 
moderated here by Prof. Richard D. 
Heffner of Rutgers University. The 
discussion centered on the powerful 
presidency and what can be done I 



Congress will be forced to deal with 
the issue of impeachment of Presi- 
dent Nixon. 

At the onset, both Schlesinger and 
McCarthy argued that the rise of the 
powerful presidency 



mergency of the Imperial 

Presidency." asserted Schlesinger, 
adding "as the party begins to 
disintegrate, the President stands out 

While this is true, both liberals 
closed their minds to the principal 
cause of this decay: the 40-year thrusl 
of American liberalism and its 
concerted effort to make the major 
political parties as alike, ideological- 
ly, as possible. The consequence of 
this look-alike political complexion is 
the growth of candidates and cam- 
paigns running independently of 
platform and party. 

Remarkably, Schlesinger made 
one admission of his own culpability 
in the growth of the powerful' 
presidency. "I would include myself 
among the sinners here," he stated 
when discussing the role of liberal 
"historians and political scientists "in 
building up an uncritical doctrine of 
the strong presidency. ..which finajly 
tempted the presidency to escape the 
regular system of accountability. "&lt; 

However, when it was suggested 
by ihis columnist that recent congres- 
sional efforts. to make, the President 
accountable have proved futile be- 
cause we have gone far beyond the 
Founders' concept of limited govern- 
ment, both of my fellow panelists 
revealed the true nature of their 



power lusting philosophy that created 
this problem. 

SI. John : "What you have here is 
the collapse of the philosophy behind 
the Imperial Presidency: the idea 
that power solves problems, that all 
you have to do is engineer or 
rearrange the social landscape and 
that, somehow, will solve our prob- 
lems. Well, as we know, it has created 
problems. When you look at the 
presidency, you can't look at it as a 
structured, formalized entity. Be- 
cause the presidency has gained this 
power by the sanction or neglect of 
Congress. 

"Take the energy problem; 
everyone is jumping on President 
Nixon about the power excesses of 
Watergate, while the Congress is 
handing over enormous powers to the 
presidency over the economic life of 
the country...." 

The suggested solution was Jeff- 
erson's idea of limiting the power of 
government and separating politics 
from economics, since it is through 
government intervention in a nation's 
economy that presidential abuse of 
power is possible. In other words, 
what is needed is a movement toward 
decentralization of government based 
on Jeffersonlan principles. 

Schlesinger: "1 don't see how you

of this "elite" in action when New

symposium on the "Crisis of the

The session I attended, "The

FOOTNOTES; A CONGRESSIONAL REPORT 



Health reform anticipated 




Congress continues its Christmas 
recess this week as Congressmen 
continue to visit with constituents or, 
in my case, travel on Congressional 
business. As a member of the 
Appropriations subcommittee res- 
ponsible for our $5 billion foreign aid 
program, I feel a special respons- 
ibility to see how our aid dollars are 
used. Although I have consistently 
voted against the foreign aid bill, I do 
think it important that Congressman 
responsible for passing on foreign aid, 
whether they are for it or against it, 
carefully study the way the money for 



s used. As a

visiting U.S. 
financed projects in South America. I 
will report to both my constituents 
and my Congressional colleagues on 
the trip when I return. 

I want to use this space today to 
review another subject with you - 

Few subjects have been on the 
minds of the American people more in 
recent years than the rising health 
care costs and problems in health 



doctors' bills, health 
hospital costs. 

In 1973 Congress confronted a 
wide variety of health care issues, 
ing the universal emergency tele- 
Medical Services Acts which allows 
federal grant assistance to com- 
munities for developing emergency 
medical care systems. 



s system utiliz- 
ing the universal emergency tel- 
phone number "911," transportation 
lacilities, treatment facilities acces- 
sible to all persons in the community, 
educational programs and con- 
tingency programs to handle natural 
disasters and mass casualties. 

The bill achieved a great amount 
of attention when President Nixon 
vetoed it during the summer. When 
the Congress could not override the 



the comprehensive Health Planning 
Program, Community Mental Health 
Centers, Hill-Burton Hospital Con- 
struction and Regional Medical 
Programs -were due to expire on 
June 30, 1973. The extension of the 
programs will give Congress time to 
carefully study the form of these 
programs in the future in light of 
President Nixon's request that five of 
the programs be terminated and two 
others be consolidated. 

Congress passed legislation auth- 
orizing government pilot projects in 
health maintenance organizations, 
commonly called "HMOs." HMO's 
are health care group practice 
organizations which agree to provide 
comprehensive medical services for a 
defined population in return for a 
fixed annual payment by each 
member. HMO advocates argue that 
the group practice facilities will lower 
medical costs because of the shared 
facilites. 

Thus Congress has taken some 
steps to help cope with the health care 
cost crisis. I anticipate that even 
more steps, including some type 
of health insurance reform, will be 
taken in the up-coming year. 



my without the intervention of the 
state. I think without the state we 
would have a system much of the kind 
that we were getting before Theodore 
Roosevelt; that is, a system of 
marked monopoly..." 

Sf. John: "Well, it's government 
that creates monopoly." 

Schlesinger: "No, it isn't govern- 



St. John: "Well, AT&amp;T is a 
government-created monopoly. Look 
at any liberal attack on monopoly and 
you will find the hand of government. 
In the power industry, we are talking 
about energy today, the government 
has been guaranteeing t 
special privilege. 




Progression of 
man questioned 



ByGREGRIPPS 

Those who believe in the eternal 
progression of Man should nowadays 
have ever more frequent reason to 
pause and wonder at his condition. 
Are we, indeed, "every day, in every 
way, getting better and better"? The 
looming spectre of the fuel crisis 
presently urges us to face up to the 
idea that an entire way of life may 
soon be gone from us forever. 

Not so unlike a graph of the stock 
market, the history of Man's "prog- 
ress" has its peaks and valleys. The 
high and low points of civilization are, 
of course, discernible only from 
considerable retrospect; there is no 
way of knowing whether we are 
currently heading upwards or down- 
wards. 

Many people are reassured by 
their conviction that, regardless of 
humanity's ups and downs, the 
"worst" is not quite as bad as it once 
was, and the "good" is always a little 
better. Maybe so. At any rate, we as a 
whole are not very concerned with the 
emense sweep of history - but 
perhaps that is our biggest problem. 



simultaneously increases Man's cap- 
ability to do good, but it likewise 
increases his ability to do evil. 

Pride brings about our downfall. 
Believing we could create an earthly 
paradise, we have discovered that we 
could destroy the earth. Many 

realization of that fact in one way 
during the Cuban missle c 



i 1970. 

The energy crisis presents us with 
a problem vastly different from 
all-out war or ecological suicide. We 
are not here faced with a choice 
between survival or total destruction, 
but confronted only by a less 
comfortable life. 

Humanity will unquestionably 
survive this crisis. Our discomfort, 
we have every reason to hope, will 
only be temporary. The crisis is not, 
after all, due to an unavailability of 
energy sources, but due to an 
overdependence upon only certain 



INDIANA - PURDUE 



energy sources, particularly oil and 
natural gas and their derivatives. 

It is not outlandish to think that 
we shall, for instance, eventually find 
a suitable replacement for gasoline. 
Nevertheless, the gasoline driven 
automobile, as such, will become a 
scarce extravagance. But no one 
driving down the highway could tell, 
with the other cars speeding past, that 
this notion is taken very seriously. 
Pride even now stands in the way of 
admitting to ourselves the circum- 
stance we are in. It is so unreal: the 
bad news came so suddenly, how can 
we believe an energy crisis is upon 
us? Were there not men around who 
could see it coming, who could have 
already begun solving the problem? 
Yet pride was in the way of such men 
as these as well. They could not 
concede that with all their technology 
they had failed. 

So now we must do without 
pleasure driving. And we must also 
give up considerable television watch- 
ing and radio listening, do without 
much of the cheerfulness light brings 
to evening, and return to older ways 
of accomodating ourselves to changes 
in temperature. 

We are, in short, forced to slow 
down, and perhaps a slowing down of 
humanity's pace would be a healthy 
thing for some of us. Maybe we shall 
learn to cultivate and to appreciate 
the invaluable things close to us - our 
home, our family, and our church. 
During the last few decades the spirit 
of the Age of Speed has induced us to 
abuse these things. In our overzealous 
quest for all things to be "meaning- 
ful" and "relevant," we have lost a 
good deal of the mystery out of our 
religion; we have lost sentiment for 
the ground where we sink our roots; 
we have cheapened "love" like an 
inflated dollar. 

Attachment to home, family, and 
church is still strong in smaller towns 
and in older neighborhoods where 
life's pace has remained somewhat 
restrained. If one would dare to look, 
he would find there are places where 
a "good" neighbor is more than one 
who simply "minds his own busi- 
ness," where three generations of a 
family frequently gather together on 
a Sunday afternoon, where "lay 
participation" in church is more than 
a strong stomach for barbeque or a 
talent for hiding the alcohol. 

Humanity will survive the energy 
crisis as it has survived so many other 
crises. Whether civilization is at an 
upswing or a downturn is something 
else upon which to reflect. But we 
need not judge humanity's success by 
the material comforts it can provide 

human inheritance, we will find 
within it the foundations for honor and 
trust - alone from which civilization 
can flourish and grow.

GO GO GEESE 

There were those who doubted the walking catfish. For 
the true believers who accept lemmings and walking 
catfish, comes now the footsore geese. You are not going to 
run into any of the geese, however, unless you happen to be 
driving on a detour through western Siberia. 

Even Walt Disney would have had difficulty trying to 
believe in these relatives of Donald. Due to some 
malfunctioning of their biological clocks, the alarm to 
migrate sounds ten days before their moulting period is 
over and their feathers have reached full growth. Unable to 
resist the internal shove, they take off, over 100,000 strong, 
plodding toward their winter home in the south. Afoot, the 
geese aren't speedy. They average about ten miles a day. 
They hike for about ten days victimized by growing 
weakness and strengthening predators. The ragged 
remnants finally reach a lake region where they can rest 
and recuperate. On fully fledged wings they then fly the two 
thousand miles to their winter home on the Ganges River. 

And you think it is a long walk from the parking lot! 
THE GARDNER PRUNED 

Dr. Joseph Gardner has a dry wit, but he was dealing 
with a wet subject the day he lectured on "January thaw." 
Somewhere in mid passage he was discussing a learned 
climatologist's view on wet grasslands, and the name of the 
authority eluded him. Dr. Joe paused and gave thought. 
Much thought. A helpful howl from somewhere in the class 
offered, "Euell Gibbons." 

"Beautiful, beautiful!" acknowledged the Doctor. It 
was inevitable that somewhat later in the session 'wild 
cranberries' made an appearance. 
AT THE POST 

Some scholars have recently remarked that the 
w.ishiiii'.ton Post was beaten by several thousands of years 
on their big slorv break. See Esdras-Nehemiah Chapter 8, 
—•"That was before the Water Gate." 

The Post probably doesn't smart under that beat, but ' 
there was a recent happening there that proves even the 
great can goof. Senator Barry Goldwater was quoted by the 
Post as saying that eventually Richard Nixon may rank as 
one of the great presidents of this century. The man . 
Senator Goldwater actually accolladed was Harry 
Truman. There was a retraction

A DREAM'S END 

The final score read: UCLA M, Notre Dame 75. The dream was over and UCLA would 
once again command the number one ranking in the polls. And it was Bill Walton and Keith 
Wilkes leading the way. 

John Wooden had his men playing life professionals when the Irish and coach Digger 
Phelps invaded Bruin country. UCLA led right from the outset and never gave Notre Dame a 
chance. 

Ves, itwas Big Bill and Wilkes leading the way for the favored Bruins. Walton tallied 32 
points before fouling out in the second half while Wilkes totaled 20. The whole UCLA team 
shot at over a 55 per cent clip over the entire game and proved to the nation that they were 
the real Number One. 

John Shumate had his usual consistent game with 25 points, but that just wasn't enough. 
The Irish seemed lost from the very beginning and played well below par for the game. 

The Irish had played four games in a week's time and probably were a little tired, but 
UCLA wasn't about to lose two games in one season. 



O.K., here is how I feel it all happened. Frazier's and Ali's agents (or managers) got 
together in 1970 and set up the arrangements to have what many considered the "Fight of the 
Century." With 2.5 million dollars going to each contestant, who could go wrong? So the date 
was set at March 8, 1971. 

They had figured that there would be two fights - the original and the rematch, so they 
had to find the best combination for making money. If Ali won the first time around, the 
rematch wouldn't be very exciting since most people didn't take Frazier too seriously. If 
Frazier won, people would really pay to see Ali try to get revenge. This vi 



showman" and the fans loved it. The fight would have to be close so that Muhammed 
could deny that he lost. 

Since Ali was the better fighter at the time, he would have to win the rematch to "save 
face" and regain his championship. But a fellow named George Foreman got in the way. 

Foreman, not considered a great fighter at the time of the first fight, managed to beat 
Smokin' Joe and that probably cost him and Ali an extra one and one-half million on their 
rematch. 

All the clowning in the first fight was Ali's excuse for losing. Quite an alibi. But with 
Frazier doing a lot of the talking before the recent fight, it became evident that he knew it 
was his turn to lose. 

Maybe it wasn't fixed, but to me I'll always feel that it was. There probably won't be 
another rematch and I don't think that Ali will meet Foreman unless he gets down in the 
financial department.
