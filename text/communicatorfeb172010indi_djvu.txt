Coffee Break 



by Kim Coffey 




Dean Omite Discusses "Earn Your Sleep" 



By Robin Crowel! 

robinyaurgr.wcivgmjil.iom 



Dean Omite re-enters the room with two glasses in hand. "I drink Ten High 
and like it," says Omite. 

He sets down the glasses and lights up a cigarette as smoke guides the eyes 
around the room to piles of un-shelved books, VHS tapes, and DVDs stacked up 
against the wall next to two full crates of records ranging from Bruce Springsteen 
to Michael Jackson, The white walls in his one bedroom apartment are clad with 
nothing more than a few posters, framed, 
of his favorite bands and movies and a 
framed Pabst Blue Ribbon mirTor added in 
for good measure. 

Though his lifestyle is simplistic and 
to the outside eye maybe even barren in 
nature, Omite's writing reveals quite the 
opposite about his persona. 

In 2009 Omite published and 
distributed "Earn Your Sleep" issue 1, the 
first installment of his self-published, self- 
written, and self- designed zine. 

"Somewhere along the way I. sort of, 
decided to collect stories that I felt needed 
written," says Omite, "and the medium 
1 needed to get my stories out there was 
never available so I created my own." 

By definition, zines are not meant to 
bring in large profit. They are simple, 
generally small, independent publications 
that can be by one author or a collection of 




contributors. Though some view underground writing and publishing as a dying 
art form, Omite's array of inspirations justify bis involvement in zine writing. 

"The first biggest influence that I can remember was J.D. Salinger with 'The 
Catcher in the Rye'," says Omite. "The first-person stream of consciousness 
narrative struck a chord with me and it was a relatable enough story where I fell a 
companionship with the narrator." 

Other than Salinger, Omite's influences include Charles Bukowski, John Fante, 
and Aaron Cometbus, an influential zine writer based out of Berkeley, California. 

"When I read Bukowski for the first time was when I decided I wanted to do 
writing for a living in a sense," says Omit e. 

Bukowski set in stone the impetus for wanting to be a writer and Fante and 
Cometbus lent inspiration when he needed it the most. 

""Ask the Dust' by Fante showed up at a time when I really needed that spark 
for inspiration. For several reasons, that book in every sense of the word changed 
my life,'' states Omite. "It challenged how I felt about people, about myself, and 
the power of the written word." 

Cometbus came around after Omite had been deep in the process of the 
creation of his zine. However, the simple, descriptive prose that Cometbus' zines 
packed with added appeal to simplistic writing that could deliver a million 
messages. 

Like most zine writers, financial gain was never of importance to Omite. "Earn 
Your Sleep" was something that he was even willing to lose money on, simply 
using it as an avenue to get his writing out there and into the hands of people that 
would appreciate it. 

"I wanted to do for others what my favorite authors had done for me," says 
Omite. 

His glass, over halfway empty, rests on his coffee table laden with old journals, 
magazine clippings, and two nearly full ashtrays. He extinguishes his cigarette 
and comments one last time on his inspirations. 

"Read Cometbus," he says, "because he does it better than I could ever hope 



IPCfiiA Mootinfl 1 McCann gives a state of the 

■ n »J \J fX IVICCIillllJi student government address 



By Peter Schnellenberger 

i ch n pjO I ©iiudtntilp fw. edu 



When people think of Indiana Purdue 
Student Govemmcnt-IPSGA- they normally 
think of the Executive branch (Student 
Body President and Vice Presidents) and the 
Legislative branch (Student Senate). What 
does not come to mind right away arc the 
other two branches- Programming (Student 
Activities Board) and the Judicial Court. 



Every year the student body president 
gathers up the four branches and holds one 
giant meeting aptly named "The All IPSGA 
Meeting." It is an assemblage seemingly 
familiar to a slate of the IPSGA address. 
This year the "All IPSGA Meeting occurred 
on Monday, February I. 

At the meeting. Student Body President, 
Amanda McCann, announced a plan "to 
integrate student feedback into student 
government." Her plan consists of 
activating IPSGA members to accomplish 



two goals during each semester Advocating 
an issue and seeking student feedback about 
the campus as a whole and campus events. 
"In the past, everyone always wants to 
sec something get done. But nobody really 
wants to do it themselves and the person in 
charge of it does not have any direction," 
said McCann. 

In order to achieve these goals she 
is suggesting five tools. They include: 
feedback raids, promoting the issue, ad hoc 
committees, resolution writing and rent a 



representative. Each one is designed to 
help members of IPSGA to advocate the set 
agenda. 

But for all this actually happen, student 
senate has to first draw up a bill and vote 
on it. 

McCann said that she is not shoving this 
idea down IPSGA's throats; she is merely 
just giving them a suggestion on how to 
put the students back into the foundation of 
student government.

The Taste and Feel of Korea 

Club Seoul throws their Second Annual Korean Film Festival 



By Hana Al Hawash 



When IPFW's Club Seoul won a grant over 
numerous other prestigious University Korean Clubs, 
you can probably imagine the excitement that swept 
over the club's members. This is the second year in a 
row that the club has competed and won. 

"It is actually quite a distinction because IPFW 
competes with major universities like Harvard and 
Yale. The students were particularly happy... it is 
really an honor," said Jenny Weathcrford, Director of 
the Office of International Programs. 

This grand funded hy the Korea Foundation and 
KITA, is what the club will be using to put on the 
second annual Korean Film Festival at IPFW. The 
festival kicked off Tuesday, February 16 with a brief 
talk about Korean culture followed by a Korean film 
(subtitled in English, of course) and free pizza. Every 



Tuesday and Thursday from now until March 4, there 
will be a new Korean film and pizza. On Wednesdays, 
there will be a series of lectures talking more seriously 
about Korean cultural issues. The main event will 
happen on Thursday, February 25, starting a 6:30pm 
in Walb Ballroom. A movie called "My Sassy Girl" will 
be showing, along with Korean 
food catered by Seoul Garden. 

The goal of this three week 
long event is to inform the 
community about cultural 
issues surrounding Korea as 
well as open people's eyes to 
what is going on in other parts 
of the world. Everyone is welcome to attend, even 
people that do not attend or work at IPFW. 

"We want people in Fort Wayne to have an 
opportunity to share and experience a little taste 
of Korea w 
President. 



Not only can you leam something about a new 
culture that makes up a good part of Fort Wayne's 
minority groups, but you can also hear about study 
abroad programs in Korea and other countries. 

So join Club Seoul at one or a few of the many 

events happening these next three weeks. If you must 

pick one or two to attend, try 

and make it to the Korean Food 

and Movie Sampler on February 

25, and do not miss a lesson in 

reading and writing given by Dr. 

Suin Roberts. This lesson will be 

happening March 3 at noon in 

Kcttler room 225. All Wednesday 

lectures will take place at noon in either room 225 or 

226 or Kcttler. Films will be taking place in room 168 

of the Science building on Tuesdays and Thursdays. 

For further information, check out flyers that will 

said Rashell Prater. Club Seoul be posted around campus or contact the Club Seoul 

office located oil the second door of Walb.

Andean and Amazonian Archaeology 
and Ethnohistory Conference at IPFW 



By Melissa R. Hirsch 



World-renowned scholars from si 
Spain, Chile, Mexico, and Canada will be participating 
in the 38th Annual Midwest Conference on Andean 
and Amazonian Archaeology and Ethnohistory here 
at IPFW Dr. Richard Sutler, Chair and Professor in 
the Department of Anthropology here at IPFW, told 
The Communicator that one of the presenters has 
even been on the Discovery channel to share his 
experience of cliff scaling! 

The conference will include various discussions 
and presentations from the more than 20 
participants on multiple topics: Andean and 
Amazonian archaeology, eihnohistory, ethnography, 
and bioarchaeology. One participant is said to be 
speaking about a recent excavation while another has 
an analysis of colonial documents. 

Although this is not the first opportunity IPFW has 
had to host this conference, Dr. Sutter is excited that 
IPFW has this opportunity. Dr. Sutter shared with The 



Communicator thai he travels, usually every summer, 
to the Andes to conduct his own research; so this 
conference contains content with which he is quite 
familiar. Back in 2000, IPFW and Dr. Sutter organized 
the same Midwest Andean conference. Interestingly, 
IPFW is not known for a large Anthropology program. 
In Fact, the opposite is true: IPFW has a small program 
with only five faculty members, a Continuing Studies 
professor, and a number of full-time staff members. 
Involved in the program are 125 majors who are 
encouraged to engage in research experiences. Dr. 
Sutter says "nine students who worked on research 
projects for research certificates last year". The 
program "generated nearly SI. 000, 000 of grants and 
contracts last year". For such a small program, IPFW's 
Anthropology Department certainly is productive! 

The conference is free, open to the public, and 
will be held here at IPFW on February 20 and 21 in 
Neff Hall, Room 101. Students from all disciplines 
are encouraged to attend and can obtain more 
informationbyvisitingwww.ipfw.edu/anthropology/

Writer Center: Encouraging Continued Success 



By Melissa R. Hirsch 

buhnnOiastudcnls.iplw.tdu 

As the Writing Center consultants celebrate 
the close of International Writing Center Week on 
Wednesday, February 17, they are proud to be invited 
to serve students from all over the world who are 
working hard to achieve and maintain academic 
success. Whether students have drafts almost ready 
to turn in or have only vague ideas about the project 
they have yet to begin, the Writing Center welcomes 
and encourages students to think critically with them 
about how to approach their topic and intended 
audience. Several students and consultants say that 
the Writing Center has been an integral part of their 
studies at IPFW. 

Because students attend IPFW from all over 
the world, the International Writing Center Week 
highlighted services that the Writing Center provides 
to students of every nationality. Last week, students 
were asked to mark where they were from on a large 
map. By doing this, students could visualize just how 
far other students traveled to attend IPFW. Students 
from every nationality and learning style i 



Writing Center and be pleasandy surprised to see that 
they maintain a thriving learning environment with 
an appreciated support system that allows students 
to be the focus. 

The Writing Center continuously looks for 
additional help due to consultants graduating each 
year. If you are an inquisitive and experienced writer, 
consider joining the team of consultants. You can 
find information about the position by going o nline 
to www.ipfw.edu/casa/writing and looking at the 
page entided Positions Available. You can also pick 
up an application on the bulletin board outside of the 
Writing Center, Kettler Hall G19. 

Due to the recent inclement weather, 
several students have had difficulties attending 
appointments. The Writing Center wants to 
encourage students to lake advantage of hours 
available each Sunday from 1 pm to 5 pm. and to log 
in to TutorTrac, via the website listed above, to make 
new appointments. For those students who have 
trouble getting to campus, the Writing Center also 
offers online consulting. Information on how online 
consultations work can also be found on the Writing 
Center's website.

Smoke Hut Diaries 



By Robin Crowell 



The hustle and bustle of the 
school day lead way to conversations 
about little sleep and, in some cases, 
even fewer showers. I'm not going 
to pretend to fight for a cause or be 
any kind of smelly martyr of any sort, 
but as of Monday, February B"\ a 
coworker and I decided that we were 
beginning ourselves into a stinky, 
smelly journey. 

As of the eighth, he and 
I decided that we were having a 
contest to see who could go the 
longest without showering. We 
have no real reason, to be honest. 
One day he and I were discussing 
the re-use of old clothes that hadn't 
been washed in however long, then 
somehow the topic came up about 
going without showers. I, being my 
boastful self, decided it was a good 
idea to challenge him to see how 
long either of us could go. 

There is no reward, and 
the only exceptions are that we are 
allowed to wash our feet and nether 
regions. This contest in itself kind 
of brings me to an interesting point 
about gender. 

A few people have it in their 



heads that this challenge is in the 
bag for my male co-worker. As it 
stands, males are considered the 
'smellier' of the genders and females 
are forced into a life of cleanliness 
and grooming. Don't get me wrong, 
I love doing my makeup and hair 
and making myself at least mildly 
presentable half the time. But I 
have gone before an embarrassing 
amount of time without bathing 
myself and, to be honest, I kind of 
pride myself in this no matter how 
smelly and repulsive that I am. 

The contest is not socially 
acceptable, it's not clean, and odds 
are that after the first week it's not 
going to be fun. But I've done the 
math. If each person spends twenty 
minutes max in the shower, each 
week showering alone takes up 140 
minutes of time, which is over two 
hours. Though it's only two hours 
a week, that's two freaking hours! 
Imagine the writing you could get 
done in that time, the reading, the 
conversations, the music you could 
listen to. 

Though I will be smelling 
outright repulsive here in about 
four days, I will be maximizing my 
time until my co-worker folds. 1 
mean, this is a competition. I won't 
surrender to body odor alone. 




Letter to Editor 

Response to Vector Marketing 

Article posted in Issue 16 of The Communicator 



Thank you for your recent article 
on Vector Marketing. Here are a few 
additional points regarding Vector and 
other direct sales companies: 

-Because students are required 
to provide money out-of-pocket up 
front, 1PFW Career Services does not 
allow Vector or similar companies 
to recruit on campus, whether it's 
through a job fair, flyers, chalkboard 
announcements, etc. They also are not 
allowed to post positions for students 
or alumni on IPFW lobZone. 

-Vector does not pay for training. 

•The claim that you can make 513- 
SI6 per hour is misleading: this is per 
sales appointment, not per hour. 

Things to keep in mind: 
-Despite knowing that our policy 
forbids Vector to recruit on campus, 
Vector representatives still come to 

. i. ill, 111 ^niltlt-Mfij l!'JUl.vr! 



IPFW without our permission and 
knowledge to recruit students, as 
recently as Monday, Feb. 1st. What 
does this say about the company? 

-They use different company names 
or don't even identify themselves as 
Vector Marketing when recruiting. Is 
this a fair practice? 

-Employers should always be 
forthcoming about the job duties 
when recruiting, but Vector does not 
inform students about the duties of the 
position up front. Why isn't this done? 
Remember, if it sounds too good 
to be true, it probably is. Be cautious 
and use your best judgment when 
evaluating potential job opportunities.

"How do I plan for my college and 

future? I want to have a good plan so 

that I don't fall behind." 

By Hana and Oevin 




Hana: First of all, I think that you should know what it is that you want. 
If I could do it over, I would take a year off after graduating high school to 
just work, save up some money and figure out what it is that I truly want to 
do with me life {if it is some sort of career that I need college for). 1 would 
not listen to what my family wanted me to do, or even friends, but 1 would 
talk to people with real experience in my areas of interest. Especially newly 
graduated people; they still understand. 

Devin: 1 think you go to college whenever you feel it is right. If you do 
not know what you want to do in life, and you want to get some general 
classes done and hop right into the college life, then go ahead. You got time 
to decide whatever you want to do. 

Hana: That's also a good start, but sometimes it doesn't work. You're 
right though, whatever feels right for you. You don't have to go with the 
whole college right away tiling, there's nothing wrong with waiting. 

Devin: True, the time is right for everyone at different times. 

Hana: But my second step would be to talk to advisors. You can talk to 
your assigned advisor, but if he orshe isn't giving good advice, find someone 
new. It's always good to have someone that understands you and what you 
want, as well as your options and choices. Really let the person know you, 
talk about your personal issues (that concern your career and college life), 
it will really help the person aid you in making a plan. 

Devin: Past teachers are good too. My old English teacher told me what 
subject I am really good at and that became my actual major. 

Hana: Yeah, that's true. But only teachers that you got to know on a more 
personal level or have seen your real work. 

Devin: True, or heard you speak and give a presentation. 

Hana: Right on. But really, I think that's all you need to do. After that, 
just keep yourself motivated and don't be swayed from what you truly want. 

Devin; Focus is key. 

Hana: Word.

OPINION 



For the love of traveling Horoscopes 

^^^^H^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H cooler. After that we walked around the r~ r +u^ i&gt;i/— — /, 




By u an,i Al Hawash 

When you think of the Middle 
East, most people think of desert land, 
camels and Bedouins. The amazing 
thing about the Middle East, however, 
is that those things do exist in certain 
areas, but it is more upscale and high- 
tech than our own country. 

After Palestine, my family and 1 vis- 
ited lordan for a few days. We stayed at 
the Days !nn hotel, which - in America 
-- is not exactly five-star. In Amman, 
lordan, though, it was comparable to 
the Ritz-Carlton. The service was in- 
credible and a serious continental 
breakfast of anything you could pos- 
sibly want was included in the price of 
the room. 

On our first night, we stayed at the 
hotel and had a Days Inn dinner, which 
was even better than the breakfast. The 
next night, however, my big sister, my 
mom and I went to see the movie New 
Moon, which had premiered about the 
same time in lordan as it did here in 
Fort Wayne. 

The next night, we decided to hit 
the biggest mall in the area. On the top 
floor of (hat mall was something com- 
parable to a Chuck E. Cheese, but way 



cooler. After that we walked around the 
several floors of the mall, looking at 
Victoria's Secret products, MAC make- 
up, and the Columbia Sportswear shop. 

After a little shopping, wc sat down 
in the food court to eat some din- 
ner from Sbarro and Burger King. As 
I chewed a lone French Fry, I realized 
that I was not at Glenbrook Mall in Fort 
Wayne, but 1 really could not tell a dif- 
ference. Stylishly dressed teenagers 
walking in groups shopping for mates 
rather than clothes, mothers haul- 
ing their sluggish children from store 
to store, and loving couples window- 
shopping... I felt as if I had never left 
America. There was even a Starbucks in 
the mall, which was truly astonishing. 

So, you see, though the rest of the 
world may speak different languages. 
have different customs and dress 
differently, we are still all human. We 
generally enjoy the same types of foods, 
love to shop, and live a comfortable life. 
For those in the Middle East that still 
live in tents in the desert, it is because 
they choose to live that way, and they 
find is satisfying. It is better not to 
assume things about cultures and 
religions outside of our own, but learn 
when you can. Strive for knowledge 
rather than remain ignorant because 
the more you know about other people 
and the more you step outside your 
comfort zone, the more fulfilling your 
life may be. 

I have traveled to many places over 
the course of my twenty years, and 
I do not plan on ever quitting. I hope 
to learn how to greet people in every 
language possible and even just meet 
someone from every country and talk 
to them about their homeland and 
ancestry. The stories you will hear and 
the people you will be connected with 
will amaze you. Everyone has his or 
her own stories; take time to listen and 
more often than not, you will have a 
great time.

ARl F.S i Mar. 2 1 -April 2(1) Remain calm and you'll 
shine. Passion should be your goal. You will be best 
suited to doing things around the house or inviting 
friends over for a visit. Take some timeout. Don't allow 
personal problems to conflict with professional duties. 

TAURUS (Apr 2 1 may 2 1 J Don't count on others 
to cover up for your shortcomings. Changes in your 
home will be positive. Don't lend or borrow money or 
belongings. Join a club to work off that excess energy; 
but consider ways of doing that without spending the 
money. 

GEMINI (May 22-June 21) Do something that will be 
stimulating and creative. Your home may be in an uproar 
and you are best to stay out ofthe line of fire if at all 
possible. Take a break; you can finally mend any disputes 
on the home front. This day was meant for love. Make 
creative changes to your residence. 

CANCER l June 22-luly 2Z) Get involved in groups 
and organizations that are of a distinguished nature. 
Personal alterations will be in your best interest. Being 
unappreciated by your boss could make it hard to do 
your work effectively. You can deal with large institutions 
or government agencies successfully this week. 

LEO ( July 23-Aug 22) Empty promises and a lack 
of cash may put a damper on your plans. Don't 
allow your personal problems to interfere with your 
professionalism. A residential move may be necessary to 
get a better job. Partnerships could prove to be lucrative. 

VIRGO (Aug. 23 -Sept. 23) Before you proceed be sure 
to talk your plans over with those they will affect. Try not 
to say the wrong thing at the wrong time. Exercise your 
talents and present your ideas to groups you think you 
can contribute to. Don't hold back. 

LIBRA (Sept. 24 -Oct. 23) Avoid any erratic behavior 
or it could cause isolation at home. Make sure that you 
have all the pertinent information before any reprisals 
or making any moves. Keep important information 
to yourself. Don't be too eager to cut those who have 
disappointed you from your life. 

SCORPIO [Oct, 24 - Nov. 22) You may not have the 
same ideas when it comes to what you both enjoy. You 
need to spend less time daydreaming and more time 
accomplishing. Organize your day well if you wish to 
accomplish all you set out to do. You should not get 
involved in joint ventures. 

SAGITTARIUS [Nov. 23 -Dec. 21} Put your efforts 
into moneymaking ventures. Stabilize your own position 
by locking up your savings. Any attractions toward 
clients will be one sided and must be put right out of 
your head. Real estate investments will payoff. 

CAPRICORN (Dec 22.- Ian. 20) Do not ruffle feathers 
if possible. You will upset your partner if you have spent 
money on things that aren't necessary. Talk to peers who 
you trust in order to get sound advice. You can sell your 
ideas to those who have the money to back them. 

AQUARIUS Han. 21 -Feb. 19) Your mate is going to 
want and need some attention. Be discreet about your 
feelings, and hold back until you find out a little more 
about the person who's coming on to you. You may want 
to make changes in your home environment. Work on 
legitimate financial deals that may enable you to bring in 
some extra cash. 

PISCES (Feb. 20-Mar. 20) Communication must 
be open, precise, and honest. Put your energy into 
moneymaking ventures. Do not force your opinions 
on others the connections will be short lived. If you're 
single, get out there and you'll meet someone new.

Artist: linx and the Back Alley Cats 
Album: Fish as Friends 
Label: Unsigned 
Release Date: 

Sounds Like: Sonic Youth went 
surfing with a horn section. 
Rating: 3.5/5 



It is truly great to hear a local band 
draw from exemplary influences and 
do wonderful things with them. This 
album notes upon mat in some of the 
greatest of fashions. 

Forone, although many of the songs 
could fall into the genre of surf rock.' 
they don't find themselves getting 
caught up in that genre specifically. 
The vocals are reminiscent of Lou 
Reed but it is evident that the vocalist 



actuaJly knows how to sing and exhibits 
some sort of vocal control. 

The vocals range, too. At times 
the vocals are in that 'speaking' style; 
however, unlike a lot of artists that try 
to get away with singing like this, linx 
and the Back Alley Cats do it well by 
varying tones and pairing the vocals 
well with the rest of the music. 

Genre-wise this album is all over 
the spectrum. At times it's psychobilly 
or country, and sometimes it borders 
ska or it straddles the line of innovative 
and classic. All in all, though, the only 
real flaws present with this album 
revolve presumably around recording 
difficulties. The vocals are hard to 
make out and it is difficult to tell if this 
is done intentionally: however, this is a 
great local band to watch out for.

Artist: Glossary 
Album: Feral Fire 
Label: Liberty and Lament 
Release Date: February 2. 2010 
Sounds Like: A bunch of rock 
and roll greats traded notes. 
Rating: 4/5 



The album goes back and forth 
between rock and roll music that you 
can dance to and country music that 
is actually tolerable. It is fronted with 
vocals that at times sound extremely 
close to those of Tom Petty. 

In tracks like "Save Your Money for 
the Weekend," it's pretty evident that 
this band is everything that Kings of 



Leon wishes they could be. Throughout 
the album the vocals falter in all of 
the right places, the guitar twangs up 
when it's supposed to, it is country in 
all of the best ways and rock and roll in 
all of the best ways as well. 

It becomes obvious that Glossary 
really isn't tryingtofitintoorperpetuate 
any genre in particular. They are just 
playing music for simply that... the 
sake of playing music. Clearly this 
band takes pride in their work. 

Feral Fire is truly an album easy on 
the ears. Appropriate for rainy days, 
sunny days, winter days, or just any 
day really. This is another great gem to 
come out of 2010 and definitely a band 
to keep on the lookout for.

Norah Jones: The 



By Kelly McLendon 

mrelendon .kellyOgma il.com 

Good music never has an expiration 
time. Take Norah Jones' newest album, The 
Fall, for example. Released in November of 
2009. it is completely full of snappy emotion. 
Her songwriting is really taking a different 
direction with the album, which features a 
more popular song called, "Chasing Pirates." 
It seems like the kind of song people would 
waltz to — it is very back and forth and very 
jazzy. Lyrically, the song is emotionally 
charged as well. One paragraph of the lyrics 
goes, "in your message you said, you were 
going to bed, but I'm not done with the night. 
So I stayed up and read, but your words in 
my head, got me mixed up so 1 turned out the 
light." Those lines seem authentic and real — 
like if you have ever been in the situation of 
not being done with a conversation, yet the 
person you want to talk to is unavailable, or 
in this case, asleep, you may understand. 



Another of the songs from The Fall is "You've 
Ruined Me," which has too much of a country 
feel for Jones' usual style. The same goes for 
"Back to Manhattan", minus the country 
style. The song is more like what Jones usually 
sings — something you would hear if you are 
hanging out at Borders or Starbucks — but it's 
slower and full of a little more sadness. 

"Young Blood" is quicker than the 
others — it seems Jones races through the 
words, but if you are fast to listen to them, 
they are somewhat touching. The song does 
not sound necessarily happy or sad, but at 
the end, the listener is left wondering which 
it really was. The mixture of elements of both 
makes it a good one to hear. 

Norah probably has not outdone previous 
albums, where she shined with songs like, 
"Don't Know Why," and "What Am I to You?" 
In fact, her record sales this time around are 
much lower than they were when her last 
album, Nor Too Late was released in 2007.

Jeff Cassaza 



By Holly Gallaway 

gall liaOl »il ud entt Ipfw. edu 

A four-month-old daughter, a teaching 
position at IPFW, directing Eurydice, and 
desiging the sound for Eurydice are the main 
things occupying Jeff Cassaza'a mind these 
days. With the production opening on Friday, 
February 19th, the cast and crew are all excited, 
but under some pressure to get everything 
done and perfect. Cassaza describes the play as 
a modern version of the original Greek myth, 
but it is done from the viewpoint of Eurydice 
herself. "It almost reminds me of Alice during 
her time in Wonderland. Certain characters in 
the play are completely mad, stated Cassaza, 
"Hades, Lord of the Underworld, reminds 
me of the Mad Hatter." At the same time, he 
explains that the play also reminds him of 
A Christmas Carol, specifically the Ghosts 
of Christmas Past and of Christmas Yet to 
Come. "There's just something odd about 
them", Cassaze remarked. In addition to the 
production, Cassaza is also teaching classes. 
He generally teaches "all the performance 
classes, currently Acting II and III, Voice I and 
II, and Movement for the Actor. He says he also 
has some classes in his mind that he wants to 
create, such as an advanced Movement for the 
Actor class, because he would be able to go so 
much more in-depth with some aspects of it. 
He has also thought about a composition class 
to help students learn how to create plays. 

Cassaza has a degree in theater, with minors 




in psychology and art administration. He did 
his graduate work on directing, acted a lot and 
was very enthusiastic about it, but switched 
over to directing in college and has done 
summer theater programs in North Carolina. 
He also completed a four-month teaching 
internship in London, working on Johnathan 
Miller's production of A Midsummer Night's 
Dream. As much as he loves the work of 
Shakespeare, he says A Midsummer Night's 
Dream has almost followed him throughout 
his career. Not only has he worked on Miller's 
production, but has acted in other productions 
of it twice, directed other productions of it once, 
and is currently reading it to his daughter. 

As for other productions he wants to be 
involved in, Cassaza mentions Shakespeare, of 
course, and perhaps some Tennessee Williams, 
wanting to do more contemporary plays. 
Ideally, he wants to work with an ensemble 
and create a play out of the rehearsals they go 
through togetherm and at the same time would 
like to create a version of Frankenstein that 
is shown with a focus on the creation aspect 
of the story. Cassaza loves Cirque de Soleil, 
simply because of the images they create while 
they are doing the performance. He also loves 
the work of the CITI Company, the House 
Theater in Chicago, and the Looking-Glass 
Theater in Chicago, specifically the work of 
Mary Zimmerman. He's not working on the 
next IPFW production, but he does have some 
exciting directing opportunities coming up 
later this year.

Best Worst First Dates 

Students share first date horror stories 



By HanaAl Hawash 

haruhaw^hdyahoO-corn 



When the holidays and the New 
Year rolls around, everyone starts to 
feel romantic, whether or not they are 
in a relationship. January brings cozy 
cuddling by the fire, and February in- 
stills fear in a young man's heart at the 
thought of Valentine's Day approach- 
ing. But nothing makes some people 
squirm more than just two little words: 
firs! date. 

Sometimes first dates can be easy 
and comfortable, but this is rarely the 
case. Even people that have known 
each other for a while can feel a bit 
awkward when hanging out becomes 
dating. With a simple question, you can 
hear "worst first date" stories that are 
so grueling they will make you cringe. 
This article might have been better 
saved forourHalloween issue. 

Adrianne lellison, a sophomore 
here at IPFW, had a pretty lame date 
just last week that could amuse you. 

"I don't know if this counts as a first 
date disaster but just a week ago I went 
on a double date with my friend (blind 
date, I didn't know who I would be on 
a date with) and I met him and he had 
■he same name as my ex. It was a disas- 
ter right when I found diat out." 

This could have ended up being a 



great date, but something as little as a olic." She preached her beliefs at the 



name can make things seem really du 
bious from the beginning. First impres 
sions are more important than some 
people want to let on, but the latter 
story, and this next one told by Manuel 
Bernal (12) proves it to be true. 

"My worst date was a set of events 
that escalated into ridiculous segments 
that would only be seen on a comedy 
sitcom. It started off on the way to a res- 
taurant where she complained about 
the music selection in my car. I played 
my music at the appropriate level, loud 
enough to

dinner table but 1 preached the silent 
prayer. Her never-ending speeches ir- 
ritated me to the point that I drove on 
the wrong side of the road resulting at a 
look at my luck, just realizing how un- 
lucky I was to be on a date with her." 

This next classic story of first im- 
pressions takes a spicy turn when this 
IPFW graduate, Angela Al Hawash -Abu 
Aita, made dinner for her boyfriend for 
the first lime. 

"As a whole, I enjoyed my first dates

in with my response being. "I don't fol- 
low any religion, but my family is Cath- 



for something exotic; Moroccan it is. I 
decided to show off that even though 
I was from the heartland of America, I 
had an extensive repertoire of cuisines. 
I peeled and chopped and tasted and 
sauteed my way around the kitchen, 
determined that this guy would be im- 
pressed. As I proudly set and welcomed 
Mr. Right to the table, I watched as he 
took a sip of the first course, spicy len- 



til soup, and... He choked. He choked 
and croaked "Water, please." ever the 
gentleman. 1 now know that he too was 
determined to impress because he fin- 
ished the soup, something he simply 
doesn't do anymore." 

Now, we all have our awkward high 
school moments, but this anonymous 
young lady takes die cake when her 
date turned into a game of hide-and- 
seek. 

"When I was a sophomore in high 
school, 1 was asked to semi-formal 
dance by the quarterback of the football 
team. 1 didn't know him that well, but I 
decided to accept and he was a football 
player so it was cool. However, the en- 
tire week before, fellow classmates kept 
warning me to be careful with this guy. 
I was naive and slightly sheltered so 1 
was freaked. So at the dance that Sat- 
urday I spent most of the time hiding 
in the bathroom. No chance for him to 
make a move, ya know? I might have 
danced a maximum of two dances with 
him. Overall, it was an awkward night. 
And then basically it was just awkward 
with him then on out." 

No matter who you are, you will 
probably have a bad first date at some 
point in your life. Some people get 
lucky, but just remember to keep the 
conversation flowing and keep the 
opinions easy. If that doesn't work, you 
can always hide in the bathroom.

By Logan Pea 



The men's volleyball season 
so far has been a tough one root 
to keep it moving on the right 
track. The men's squad may have 
gotten the boost that they need- 
ed this past weekend, as they de- 
feated Grand Canyon University 
in three straight sets, within two 
nights. IPFW ruled the court all 
weekend. Friday night started it 
all as the 'Dons pickup their first 
conference win of the season. 
(30-21. 30-28, 30-26) 

Moving on to Saturday eve- 
ning, junior, outside hiner Dar- 
ryl Shank had a huge night. 
Shank led the 'Dons with 17 
kills, giving him a weekend total 
of 34 kills. He is currently lead- 
ing in kills with a season total 
195 so far. Eion Fyfield. IPFW's 
young standout also had himself 
a productive weekend, notching 
20 kills. 

The Volleydons looked very 
impressive from start to finish, 
never trailing by a number large 
enough to keep them down and 



One set though. IPFW did 
find themselves in a hole down 
nine. Thanks to Shank's and Fy- 
field's grit and determination, 
the two power hitter led IPFW 
back in the match, and onto vic- 
tories. 

Shaun Dryden and Ivan Ma- 
tos found themselves laid flat 
out on the floor often as they 
combined for a two game total 
of 39 digs. 

The senior Oli Kook ended 
his weekend with 18 kills and 
sophomore Dan Mader ended 
the two game span with 76 as- 
sists. 

The two big wins boosted 
IPFW's record to 5-5 overall and 
2-3 in the conference. The wins 
were hopefully exactly what the 
volleydons need to get their sea- 
son rolling. IPFW has three big 
games on the road (St. Francis 
PA, Penn State, and Ball State) 
before they return home for two 
more tough matches against 
Cardinal Stitch and "national 
powerhouse' Ohio State. The 
two matches will be played 
March 5, and March 6 in the 
Gates Center and both will be 7 
p.m. starting times.

60 Second Sports Report 



By Lucas Fisher 



In Ihe NBA il was All-Star weekend 
in Dallas, Texas. It started on Friday 
with the Celebrity game that the West 
won 41-37. Then after that game was 
over it was time for the Rookies vs. 
Sophomore challenge the Rookies won 
the game for the first time in eight years 
140-128. Deluan Blair and Tyreke Ev- 
ans were co-MVP's. Then on Saturday 
Steve Nash won the Skills competition, 
Paul Pierce won the 3-point contest, 
and Nate Robinson won his third slam 
dunk contest. All the events leading up 
to the All-Star game were over hyped 
and boring. On Sunday the All-Star 
game was played in front of a record 
crowd in the new Cowboy stadium with 
108,713 fans..The game was filled with 
highlight plays but came down to free 
throws. The East won the game 141-139 
as Dewayne Wade won the MVP honors 
with 28 points and 1 1 assists. Over the 
weekend the Dallas Maverick pulled 
off the first major trade before the 
deadline sending losh Howard, Drew 
Gooden, and Uvo others to the Wizards 
for Caron Butler, Brendan Haywood, 
and DeShawn Stevenson. The top five 
in the power rankings are: the Lakers, 
the Cavaliers, the Magic, the lazz, and 
the Nuggets. 

In NASCAR it was time for the Day- 
tona 500 but before they got to that on 
Sunday they had to run the Nationwide 
Series on Saturday. The Nationwide 
race was highly anticipated because it 
was the debut of Indy car driver Danica 
Patrick in a NASCAR race. She started 
IS" 1 , not feeling comfortable in the draft 
she fell to the back and eventually was 
caught up into a wreck and finished 
?&gt;&amp;. Late in the race Dale Jr. flipped 
his car and Tony Stewart won the race. 
On Sunday it was time for the big one. 
The race was great when they were ac- 



tually racing, but the race got delayed 
twice due to a pothole in turn one. The 
race was delayed a total of 2 hours and 
24 minutes. Jaime McMurray won the 
race, it was his fourth career victory, as 
he beat out Dale Jr. on the final lap in 
overdrive. 

In ihe Winter Olympics sad news 
hit before the opening ceremonies, we 
learned of the death of Nodar Kumari- 
tashvili a Georgian Luger. His accident 
happened during a practice run. The 
first gold went to Anastasia Kuzmina 
in the women's biathlon; Sven Kramer 
won the gold in men's 5.000M speed 
skating breaking an Olympic record, 
Hannah Kearney won gold in women's 
freestyle skiing, Lee Jung-Su beat out 
Apolo Anton Ohno for the 1.500M short 
track speed skating, Seth Wescott won 
gold in snowboard cross, and Mo Tae- 
Bum won gold in men's 500m speed 
skating. Through Monday the medal 
tracker has the USA in first with 8, Ger- 
many in second with 5, and France in 
third with 4 medals. 

In men's college basketball the top 
five in the AP poll are: Kansas, Kentucky, 
Villanova, Purdue, and Syracuse. Con- 
necticut head coach Jim Calhoun made 
his return to the sideline after a three 
and a half week medical leave on Sat- 
urday. In his first game back they were 
defeated by Cincinnati 60-48 and Cal- 
houn said that he was "embarrassed". 
On Monday the team responded with 
a huge upset over number three Villa- 
nova 84-75. In the games of the week 
Syracuse beat UConn 72-67, Duke beat 
North Carolina 64-54. Pittsburgh upset 
West Virginia 98-95 In three overtimes, 
Kentucky held off Tennessee 73-62, 
and Louisville upset Syracuse 66-60. In 
women's college basketball the top in 
the AP poll are: Connecticut, Stanford, 
Nebraska, Notre Dame, and Tennes- 
see. UConn has remained undefeated 
extending their winning streak to 65
