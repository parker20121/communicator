In a straight line. 



Master discs are cut in a straigtit line from edge to center. With 
no tracking error. 

Ttiat's exactly how the Rabco ST-7 plays your record. In a 
straight line from edge to center. With no tracking error. 
But that's only the beginning. The arm, carried by the remarka- 
ble "rolamite" bearing, moves across the disc in a straight line. 
The result is a cascade of zeroes. Tracking error? Zero. Skating 
force? Zero, Stylus overhang? Zero. Vertical force? Zero. 
Horizontal force? Zero. 

Simply stated, the nevi( ST-7 provides a way of playing music in 
the home that makes conventional pivoted arm turntables 
obsolete. 
We invite you to a demonstration.

The new Harman Kardon 430 displays square wave 
H response that is indistinguishable from the finest power 
amplifiers A listening test will reveal that the 430, in all but 
absolute power levels, is the sonic equivalent of fine individual 
component systems. 

And the 430 AM/FM tuner and preamplifier are consistent with 
the outstanding performance quality of its amplifier. 
We invite you to listen to this remarkable receiver. It will demon- 
strate that quality need not be sacrificed to achieve the 
economy of size, convenience and price.

The A401 is a direct descendent of the research and develop-
