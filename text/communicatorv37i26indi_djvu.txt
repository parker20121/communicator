Women fall victim in hip-hop portrayals 



By Zach Hunsinger 

Regardless ol where one grew up 
or currently lives, regardless of wlml 
music one listens to or the TV shows 
one watches, regardless of skin color 
or social class, everyone is immersed 
in a society that is flooded with hip- 
hop. Hip-hop is everywhere It lives 
on the radio, mi television, in maga- 

lisements. in the Internet, and even 
on chat engines. Ignoring the influ- 
ence of hip-hop is impossible. Un- 
loiiiui.uely, the influence is far from 
positive. 

Linda Wade, an IPFW student and 
CEO of Nature Nurture Urban Con- 
sultants, presented the .seminar titled 
The Negative Images of Women 
Portrayed in Hip-Hop Music." Wade

which was also broadcast over the 
IPFW TV channel. The seminar 
discussed the negative dominance 
of rap, the socialization of tea of rap 
and how the average person can tight 

Wade initiated the presentation by 
playing a platinum song tilled "Hyp- 
notize." The song features several 
explicit sexual references along with 
several explicit advertisements; all 
references were sung to a captivat- 
ing beat. She further explained thai 
we live in an "environment saturated 
with sexual content." Her explana- 
tion included descriptions of how 
sexual content within rap can syslem-

"Women are portrayed as weak, is only a reflection of our society. 



Yet. one can not ileny the impact hip- 
hop has. Music videos will display 
saintly dressed women next to fully 
clothed men. The videos Ore set in 
expensive mansions. Most videos 
feature scenes alluding to women 
servicing men Commenting about 
llie Uiaractors in ihe videos. Hylield 
stated that they are "living a life thai 
is not real" and Ihe audience misses 
that point. 

Bylield then explained how hip- 
hop helps to instill self-hatred within 
young girls. The girls are socialized 
into believing what they hear. After 
years of being devalued through mu- 
sic and videos, the girls are forced 
to accept the poor illustrations. In 
summer camps in which Hylield vol- 
unteers. 10 and 1 1-year-old girls are 
asking alarming questions. She de- 
scribed one 1 1 -year-old girl asking 
if she performed oral sex would she 
still be a virgin. Another asked if us- 
ing adult toys lor pleasure would end 
her virginity, 

Other girls cannot accurately de- 
scribe their personality or body. Kind 
words disappear from girls' vocabu- 
lary when talking about themselves. 

"We are living in a crisis," Bylield 
claimed. "While not all hip-hop is 
doing this, it does help us gel to the 
crisis." To combat this problem she 
again explained the importance of 
educating ourselves. Also, she advo- 
cated seeking Jesus Christ and find- 
ing strength within ourselves,

Brings Awareness 



By Hidi Moore 
Copy Editor 



Hard sheets of cold rain fell on 
March 28. but the beckoning warmth 
of IPFWs Walb Student Union 
prompted many people lo come in- 
side and learn about their health. 

The 1 8th Annual IPFW Health Fair 
included over 100 exhibits [bat of- 
fered sludents and ihe community 
free fitness demonstrations, food, 
gills, health education and health 

Located in the ballroom and on ihe 
second door, hourly fitness demon- 
strations included yoga, de-stressing, 
core stability, belly dancing and Pi- 

Thc 12:30 p.m. belly dancing dem- 
onstration, led by A/usena bint Zwce- 
na, a principal dancer with Troupe 
Talecha, showed sludents how lo re- 
lieve stress through movement. Her 
belly dancing class is offered through 
Ihe IPFW Division of Continuing 
Studies from July 30 - Aug 29 on 
Monday and Tuesday evenings from 
5:30 - 6:45 p.m. for a cost of $65. 

"Join!" said Zweena. "Belly danc- 
ing offers flexibility, slrength and con- 
fidence, which can be lacking in stu- 
dents on campus." She also advised 
to join, because dance solves a big 
problem for many students — finding 
time for oneself. For more informa- 
tion on belly dancing, contact Zweena 
at j/usen.ibinl/ ween.ifn.-yahoO.com. 

Food was also aplenty throughout 

many of the 108 booths. The IPFW

sion was conducted after By- 
field's tulk. During this session 
Ihc three speakers addressed 
Ihc gimmicks of ihe music 
induslry. Markcling ploys of 
mentioning alcohol and co- 
logne in songs. lead to a rise 
in sales. However, the goods 
marketed in rap songs arc de- 
preciable. These items lower 
in value as they age. The cor- 
porations who own the music 
artists have large profits and 
then use ihe profits to invest 
in appreciable items, With 
more profit the corporations 
can advertise more depre- 
ciable goods, continuing the 
cycle. Wade said, "music is a 
gimmick, an entry level, that 
reaches Ihe mainstream." 

The three speakers agreed 
education and confrontation 
arc ihc best tools for combat- 
ing this threat. This can be 
done through one-on-one re- 
lationships. Wade described 
most people as unaware of the 
situation. Parents may not un- 



derstand the lyrics or the innu- 
endos. Radio stations may not 
completely censor a swear or a 
sexual reference. 

Smiley said the dynamics 
of rap music are too complex 
to be fought in any one way. 
One main problem is societal 
greed. People want to make 
money, and the bottom line 
is sex sells. Unfortunately. 
women arc depicted inac- 
curately, inappropriately and 
consequently devalued. When 
devaluation reaches a certain 
level, violence against wom- 
en is tolerated. Eventually 
women arc essentially turned 
into sex toys. Society needs 

itself; otherwise it is going to 

Nature Nurture, the urban 
consultant program directed 
by Wade, seeks to correct this 
societal problem. The pro- 
gram studies the impacts rap 
has on people. Pom is already 
a big industry; rap simply uses 
Ihc same methods. As a result, 



Communicator flooded with awards 



sexual predators arc often glo- 

Young girls are socialized 
into believing what they see 
and hear. What they arc see- 
ing and hearing is describing 
women as worthless, weak and 
only important when almosl 
naked. There is a direct re- 
sult on girls' body images and 
what is depicted in music vid- 
eos. Wade mentions lhal the 
FCC is doing its best at keep- 
ing negative songs and videos 
off the mainstream air, but il 
is not completely successful. 
Editing songs is difficult and 
as Smiley mentioned, children 
can find ways around parental 
filters. Also, some parents jusl 
are unaware. Nature Nurture 
is making "a plea out to con- 
scious people" to speak against 
these problems. 

The problem is the cumu- 
lative effect of radio being ir- 
responsible, unaware parents 
and citizens and corporate 
marketing ploys. ^

BCC announces winners 



Richard Wanjcma and Sherri 
Emerson shared the glory of 
producing a winning design for 
Ihe campus organization, and 
by shifting the BCC's identi- 
fier from a logo to a symbol, 
the Caucus believes that ihere

impression left i

unveiling in April, and will in- 
clude Ihc BCC initials and the 
Baobab tree, which is native 
lo Africa. Some of these trees 
have been carbon-dated to 
about 2,000 years of age, and 
grow to be large enough

"We wanlcd something 

stronger, something that would 
represcnl the strength and cul- 
ture of African- Americans and 
have longevity," said Sherri 
Emerson, President of the 



homes for a dozen people. The 
trees provide sustenance, shel- 
ter and renewable resources. 

The design for the BCC may 
be succinctly designed and 
appear bare to the average 
passerby, but il is packed with 
symbolism. In addition to the 
Ircc, the design will contain 
Ihc gold letters "BCC," sym- 
bolizing the richness of the 



African continent; red for the 
blood shed in the zeniih of the 
slave trade; and green for Ihe 
lush hind that remains. 

"The Baobab tree and our 
symbol stands for what society 
is supposed lo be about, which 

together as a community." said 
attendee Scott Smiley. 

Coinciding with the official 
unveiling of the new BCC 
symbol, there will also be a 
conference April 28 that will 
delve into contemporary issues 
facing the African-American 
community today. The confer- 
ence is open lo Ihe entire Fort

How to successfully break up a band 



By Mike Webb 

Arts and Entertainment 

Editor 



Anyone who has played in a band 
for an extended period of time knows 
that there are conflicts that can and 
more than likely will arise. 

When putting together music 
with other people, as much as the 
musical purists would like (o have 
us believe that it should always How 
naturally from our souls, the reality 
of the situation is that you are putting 
together a product for others, and the 
end result reflects upon you as much 
as anyone else involved in the cre- 
ative process. 

When reputations are on the line, 
sometimes visions don't match and 
conflicts arise. I believe that this is 
why we hear so many hands compare 
their dynamics to that of a romantic 
relationship. What is a romantic re- 
lationship without compromise'' !t is 

I am learning more and more that 
compromise in relationships must be 
done out of love. Grudges cannot be 
held .igainst one another when one 
doesn't get his or her way, they arc 
simply unhealthy and leads to resent- 
As someone who has played in 
a band that featured somewhat of a 
dictator as a front man, I can tell you 
that the same principles apply to that 
relationship, 100. 

The truth of the matter is that I

After waiting for politeness, nothing \!&gt; I'nend obvi- 




deserved it. I have worked in a few 
restaurants along (he way and I never 
would have done that. 

Maybe it's because of common 
sense ihat some people are good in 
retail and service industries and oth- 
ers should be forced to work with 
animals. Then they have to'be nice 
or they'll get mauled by say ... a po- 
lar bear. That's just me thinking; I 
wouldn't wish those people harm at 
the claw of any animal. 

1 think there should be some sort 
of hiring standards, especially when 
it comes lo teenagers. Give them a 
test involving stress management 
and customer satisfaelion. If they 
don't pass, they don'l gel the job and 
they have to look for another one. I 
also feel that if they DO pass said 
test, they must periodically lake tesls

all of ihe employees did. Where do I 
sign up for thai job'.' That would be

and who should be unemployed" 
1 think that may just be one of my 
dream jobs. 

Nol only do these companies grade 
on how good sen ice and selection is, 
but (hey also test how well the em- 



ployees keep an eye on product as 
some are tesling shoplifting capabili- 
ties. I think this is amazing. Not only 
does it show who can catch a thief, 
but it goes lo show how many people 
a shoplifter has to gel by without 
anyone noticing. 1 do have one prob- 
lem with that. Considering the rate of 
turnover at most retail and service in- 
dustry jobs, how can managers prop- 
erly train all their employees on what

but, believe it or not, there-are ever- 
cliangiug trends in shoplifting and

Therefore. I think that teenag- 
ers should have to wail longer before 
having a job. say 18, and be at least 
somewhat compelenl at life before 
they take on a job involving the pub-

upon them and all other employees

Rockstar energy drink

There are a couple \

just grab an energy drink 
ly labeled Rockstar. 

If you thought drinking an energy 
drink was already a bad idea then 
lucky for you Rockstar has found a 
way to make breakfast seem a little 
more exciting. Rockstar Juiced is ihe 
energy drink of Ihe week, and like 
Sieve Seagal's Lightning Boll, this 
drink conies in two flavors: Guava 
and Orange. 

Bolh flavors are remarkably deli- 
cious and not misleading. Guava ac- 
tually tasles like guava, and orange

Another cool fact about ihis drink 
is thai it conlains 70% juice and 100%

Kids Play 
and Learn 
at Library 

By Louisa Danielson 



Maybe you remember being a 
little kid, walking out of the library 
with ,1 stack of books propped under 
your chin. You lumed in a mountain 
of books every week - and cheeked 
out another pile every time. 

Well, the scene hasn't changed 
much. The Allen County Public Li- 
brary children's department is still 
full of books - some 400,000 of them. 
in fact, located at the main branch. 
Now that the library has finished its 
nuilii-million dollar renovation, all 
these books and more .ire available to 
the public. 

Librarian Mary Voors, who has 
worked at the ACPL for 25 years, is 
a pillar of the children's department. 
"(It's) the best place to work," she 
said. Librarians must have a master's 
degree in library science, although 
some librarians also have back- 
grounds in other fields, like cduca- 

"Our library system is very, very, 
very committed to pre -literacy," said 
Voors. The ACPL was one of the first 
libraries in the country with a chil- 
dren's section 1 he department origi- 
nally opened in 1907. 

The 2007 children's department 
was designed through the collabora- 
tion of children's librarians from the 
ACPL system and the community 
who were "(c)ommitled to having a 
very dynamic and active children's 
department." said Voors. hxamplesot 
their innovation include a gian 
tank system that has two salt 
tanks and one reef tank; a computer 
room; a playhouse; short shelves lor 
young patrons and an early learning 
center where children and grow 
interact in a learning-saturated 
ronmenl. "There is no technology of 
any kind in there,"' mentioned Voors. 
"(only) face-to-face interaction be- 
tween mom and dad and child." 

The early learning center is for 
preschool -aged children and adults. 
Special areas in the center include a 
writing center, a drama comer and 
many reading nooks where chil- 
dren can read with adults. Children 
are encouraged to explore narrative 
skills, letter knowledge, print aware- 
ness, print motivation, phonological 
awareness and vocabulary. In the 
past, children have done this by cre- 
ating alphabets, telling stories and 
showing interest in books. "Kids 
have to have (a) phonological refer- 
ence," said Voors, highlighting pan 
of the center's curriculum. In Febru- 
ary alone, 6,218 people visited the 
Center. There is no sign up sheet; 
however, an adult must constantly be 
present with his or her child.

Philharmonic Presents Musical Stories 



By Louisa Danielson 



"Viol 



,iD-f 






Every place 
story to tell. The Fort Wayne Philhar- 
monic demonstrated this on Saturday. 
March 10 at the Embassy Theatre. 

The first work of the performance 
was Michael Daugherty's Philadel- 
phia Stones a synopsis of life in the 
big city. "Sundown on South Street " 
had pounding, tandem percussion 
hammering away from both sides of 

The punchy, alive rhythm of the 
music brought to mind the back- 
ground music of a nightly news 

'Tell-Tale Harp" was played by 
two harps from the front of the or- 
chestra. For such gentle instruments, 

the swooping arpeggios they played 
soared to the very balcony of the au- 
ditorium in a haunting yet modern 



"Bells for Stokowski" was loud. 
If the musicians had had orange vests 
and hardhais. the music would have 
been a perfect facsimile of a highway 
repair scene with clanging metal and 
loud discords. 

It opened with chimes reminis- 
cent of the Liberty Bell. Then it grew 
to a tangled cacophony that melted 
into a harp duel of Bach's "C- Major 
Prelude." also known as the "Ave 
Maria." 

The prelude picked up speed. 
raced from the harps to the rest of I he 
orchesira and ended in a not ol noise 
with the enure orchestra blasting the 
auditorium. Shouts and applause lin- 
ished this half of the concert as Con- 
ductor Tehiv/hcl left the stage. 

The second story of the evening 
was more subtle. Augusim Hadelich. 
gold medalist at the 2006 Interna- 
tional Violin Competition of India- 
napolis, performed the Tchaikovsky 



Italian-born in l l &gt;S4 of German 
parents. Hadelich has been perform- 
ing on the violin since he was 7- 
years-olil. He was nearly killed in a 
lire at bis family's farm when he was 
15. However, following numerous 
operations and months of recovery. 
he once again took the stage. 

This evening, as Hadelich per- 
formed on the ex-Gingold Slradivan 
violin. Hadelich played with die ease- 
that only a real master of the instru- 
ment could manage. To put it suc- 
cinctly, he was good. The concerto 
was originally declared "unplayable" 
by 19th century violinist Leopold 
Auerdue to the tremendous difficulty 
of the piece. 

Hadelich played the gigantic 
chords, double octaves and high notes 
from the lop of the violin not only 
with case but with impeccable into- 
nation, even when his violin slipped 
in its tuning mid-performance.

The culture of Appalachian students 



Anyone with a desire to look outside of 
their own cultural bubble will notice the amaz- 
ing diversity lhal life has to offer. 

Even those who rccot!iu/e this diversity as 
it pertains to individuals in different countries 
often fail in see the differences ihat are closer to 

On April 9, the Department of Iinidish and 
Linguistics will give students the opportunity 
to gain a little more cultural insight when the 
department presents a lecture by Associate Pro- 
fessor Sara Webb-Sunderhaus on college stu- 
dents in the Appalachian Mountains. 

Webb-Sunderhaus is also the director otitic 
writing center. Her Ph.D. from Ohio Slate Uni- 
versity, and one of her specialties is in Appala- 
chian studies and folklore. 

A fascinating look nilo the lives of students 



in the Appalachians is not only for the purpose 
ol education; it is also lo promote the Depart- 
ment of English and Linguistics in a new way. 

According to John Merh.ir. president o! the 
English and Linguistics Organization, "English 
is more than just reading and writing, it's his- 
tory, culture and so much more. Our goal is lo 
help make people aware of that." 

With an equal approach of storytelling, 
folklore and anthropology. Webb-Sunderhaus' 
lecture will do just that. 

The lecture will take place April 9 at noon 
in CM 144. 

There will be 45 minutes of presentation, 
and 15 minutes of social time. Don't miss the 
opponunih lo expand your cultural horizons.

Women's Softball slams Notre Dame 
College in late home opener 



After several cancella- 
tions due lo adverse weather, 
the IPFW softball team finally 
played a game at home last 
week in a double header against 
the Falcon's of Notre Dame 
College (OH). 

Fortunately, the game was 
one worth waiting for, as IPFW 
dominated both games of the 
double header last Thursday af- 
ternoon, winning 3-1 in game 1 
and 6-4 in game 2. The softball 
team now stands 5-13 for the 
season after a string of tough 
loses away during the Rebel 
Games held in Orlando, FL, in 
the first week of March. 

IPFW's Junior shortstop 
Ty Lambert (23) was the first 
to score Thursday after a third 
baseline hum set her to advance 
to third base by a grounded out by 
sophomore inlicklcr Michelle Mci- 
ghan (11) and an error by the NDC 
second base which took her to home 
plate. NDC would come back in the 
fourth inning to tie after a similar er- 
ror by second base player Abby Li- 
den (8). 




After the changeover, IPFW 

wnukl answer hack ti&gt; regain ilie lead 
with a run from pitcher Kayla Pow- 
ell after stealing third and a hit from 
Meighan. 

The final run of game 1 would be- 
long in Liden .jfler third ha.se player 
Kacic Sionc ( 14) delivered a double, 
matching Lidcn's. IPFW would keep 



the Falcon's caged the rest of the 
game closing with a score of 3 to 1. 
Another set of doubles by Liden and 
Stone would again [nil Liden across 
the plate. 

With Stone on 2nd, NDC walked 
Powell and a bunt by Lambert would 
load the bases, A home run baited in 
by pinch hitter Ashley Tharp (13) 



would empty litem giving IPFW a 5- 
1) lead by the lop ol llie I st inning. 

The Falcons would score 4 in the 
innings to come, hut one more run 
batted in by Powell which brought 
Stone home would seal the deal giv-

came back from a 5-poiul deficit to tie 
28-28. A Quincy kill gave the Hawks 
the lead and a attack error hy junior

the IPFW team that this team would

But He Dies in the Middle. 



At his crucifixion, not even Jesus' closest followers would have called him a hero. The 
man they thought was the Messiah was being executed. End of hopes. End of dream. 

But then something happened. Three days later, his body was not in its burial tomb. 
That night, he physically appeared to his disciples. He showed them all of the Scriptures that 
foretold that he would die for the forgiveness of sins and then rise from the dead.
