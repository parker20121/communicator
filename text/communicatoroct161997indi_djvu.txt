Disabled students 
meet challenges 

By Abigail Horrom 
Staff Reporter 

Susan Borror is brand new io the 
IPFW campus this year and is in full 
swing with her position as bead of 
disabled services. 

Borror look over the position 
from Randy Borst, who served as 
director for seven years. 

"Randy and I have very similar 
philosophies aboul persons with dis- 
abilities and competition in the 
workforce," said Borror. "In the 
seven years as director, he provided a 
really strong infrastructure that is 
well-respected." 

One of the main obstacles Borror 
faces is accommodating students 
with disabilities in the classroom so 
that they may obtain sufficient 
course material. This, of course, 
deals with note taking. 

At the beginning of each semes- 
ter, if a professor has a disabled stu- 
dent in class, he/she must ask for a 
volunteer who would be willing to 
take notes for this student However, 
sometimes that is easier said lhan 
done. 

"Some professors feel that other 
students in there are reluctant to 
commit to attending every single 
class," said Borror. 

The kinds of students who need 
studenl volunteer note takers have a 
wide variety of disability issues. 
There are persons with arthritis in 
their bands who take a tape recorder 
io class but. nonetheless, prefer writ- 
ten notes. Some may have a partial 
hearing loss. As long as they are sit- 
ting in front tbey may be able to bear 
or read lips, but it is Mill beneficial 
for them io compare notes with ihose 
of a reliable individual in case they 
missed an important point. 

Others have psychological 
impairments which result in poor 
concentration during lectures. With 
these disabilities it is important to 
obtain volunteer note takers, Borror 
said. 

As of right now, there are no 
funds available to pay note takers. 
However, there are funds for other 
services and students are recruited at 
the beginning of the year for those. 

"We have a number of people 
who require their books on tape, so 
we do recruit for readers," Borror 
said. 

Not all the necessary books are 
available through disabled services 
though. There is a reader service 
from the Library of Congress that 
has audio books available. With 
these features, literature can be 
ordered ahead of time. The main 
problem. Borror said, is textbooks at 
IPFW change frequently. 

"There is not a lot of resistance 
from professors to attempt finding a 
volunteer note taker. But I think it is 
just one more thing at the beginning 
of the semester when the professor 
tries to get a note taker and it doesn't 
happen It ends up being an addition- 
al burden," Borror said. 

Borror said she feels before dis- 
abled students are accommodated in 
a job, their needs must be first met in 
the classroom. 



Campus conducts 
diversity study 



By Dodie Miller 
Chief Reporter 



Diversity. The word is so 
shamelessly overused thai 
the lack of it loses signifi- 
cance, luming a very important 
issue inlo a watered down cliche. 

The need for IPFW to take a 
critical look at itself has been evalu- 
ated by the diversity council 
through a survey which was drafted 
during the 1996-97 academic year. 

Jeanette Clausen, chair of the 
diversity council, said she was not 
surprised by the findings which, 
among other things, determined that 
50 percent of tbe respondents felt it 
would be a positive factor for IPFW 
to have diversity training. 

The survey also found that 
women were more likely than men 
to say that diversity training was 
important and whiles were more 
likely than people of color to say 
that diversity was not necessary. 

That response is related to one 



of the latter findings, that people 
who benefited the most by leaving 
things as they are were least likely 
to advocate change. 

The survey took over a year to 
plan, conduct, and analyze. 

After the results were compiled. 
Kenneth Bordens, professor of psy- 
chology, refined the original draft 
and performed the statistical analy- 
sis. 

The results were then presented 
to Frank Borrelli, vice chancellor of 
student affairs, who decided that all 
of the information should be shared 
with faculty members. 

Chancellor Michael Wartell 
then assigned the diversity council 
the task ot drafting a campus strate- 
gic plan for diversity. 

Jeaneite Clausen is cautiously 
optimistic. 

"1 am daunted, but not that 
much," she said. "I know that there 
are good faculty and chairs that 
believe in nurturing a diverse cam- 
pus population." Clausen said. 

The factors that are a probable 
cause of Clausen's wavering opti- 



mism are those that may make tbe 
implementation of another survey 
difficult. 

These include financial binds, 
competition for resources (from 
other projects) and studenl turnover. 

Why would the last factor be a 
hindrance? 

"Each new class of students 
makes a new challenge each year," 
said Clausen. 

The diversity council welcomes 
input from students. 

The council also warns students 
to present proposals to them for 
Diversity Week (March 22-28.) 

Individuals wishing to share 
their input should address their 
questions and concerns to Clausen 
or contact studenl members Kevin 
Orthman and Lynette Johnson- 
Lewis or e-mail Clausen at 
ctausen® ipfw.indiana.edu.

Busses driving to serve students Olmos: We're all 

in the same gang 



By Dodie Miller 
Chief Reporter 



While most students endure the 
torture of driving to IPFW there are 
many who rely on Fort Wayne's 
public transportation system (PTC) 
to get tbem to campus on lime. 

Over a week ago, the PTC 
General Manager and a representa- 
tive from IPFW met to discuss how 
the needs of students who ride the 
bus could belter be fulfilled. 

The main concern of lhat meet- 
ing was lhat many sludents felt that 
the time the busses ran should be 
lengthened in the evenings to pro- 
vide more students with the opportu- 
nity to take evening classes. 

"1 have bad students come io me 
all the tune saying thai they would 
like to lake evening classes but they 
live on the South Side and could 
never make il on time. ..after taking a 
seventy-minute bus trip," said 
Christine Patterson, director of the 
Office of Multicultural Services . 

Patterson said she would like io 
see more of a partnership between 
PTC and IPFW. 

She said she has seen it work ai 
other campuses, including 
Bloomington, South Bend, and Penn 
Stale. 



"The PTC is suffering from lack 
of ridership...and that's due to poor 
service," said Patterson. 

Patterson points oul that every 
student is charged a parking fee, 
whether or not they drive to IPFW. 

She feels that if PTC offered a 
semester pass for bus nders, IPFW 
could, in turn, like other campuses, 
put money into the PTC. 

That would provide better bus 
service to students as well as gener- 
ate much needed funds for PTC. 

Tom Pfefferkom. Director of 
Operations for Public 
Transportation Corporation, does 
not predict thai changes in service 
will cosl more for sludents. 

"We'll be doing a combination 
of things," Pfefferkom said. "We're 
looking at revamping lots of routes, 
including IPFW." 

Pfefferkom acknoweledged 
complaints about the service and 
referred to a study PTC had done by 
an outside entity. 

"A study by an independent 
agency, as part of ihe Transportation 
Planning Committee, which is a 
subdivision of the City Planning 
Committee, analyzed bus routes and 
numbers of riders. The biggest com- 
plaint, was lhat busses run loo infre- 
quently," said Pfefferkom. 

"The only problem is that more 



busses cost money " 

This would be where a partner- 
ship with the university would help 
out. 

Pfefferkom said without more 
busses, the current system has every 
bus going downtown to transfer rid- 

PTC has long been addressing 
the problem of frequency. 

There is no definite dale of 
implementation set but Pfefferkom 
predicts lhat the change should 
occur around June 1. 

He said be was uncertain about 
how much the routes will change, 
but said many routes will become 
shorter, which may" change where 
people catch the bus. 

It would cut down on travel time 
because it's an ongoing process he 
said 

A process thai cannot be quick- 
ened soon enough for some PTC 



Frank Borelli. vice chancellor of 
student affairs, said that two key 
issues will be addressed by PTC 
before the changes could begin. 

"They would like to find oui 
how many studcnLs would be using 
the service, and io what pan of the 
city does ihe service need to extend 
itself," said Borelli.

Edward James Olmos, actor and 
Hispanic activist, spoke to a packed 
Walb Ballroom Friday, Oct. 3, about 
giving minority children a history to 
make them proud of their heritage. 

Olmos, best known for his roles 
in "Miami Vice" and "Stand and 
Deliver," said many minority chil- 
dren have difficulty achieving suc- 
cess because so few people of color 
are looked upon as heroes by soci- 
ety. 

"The key to relating lo 
(Hispanic) youth is unconditional 
love." said Olmos. "And always 
speak from the heart." 

Tbe crowd in the Ballroom was 
nearly half Hispanic and responded 
well lo his message of racial pride, 
but without alienating different 
races. 

Olmos traced his roots back lo 
Africa before ihe crowd io show 
everyone thai we spring from the 
same well of life. 




Olmos 
removes bis 

Hollywood per- 
sona in order to 
do his humani- 
tarian work with 
the same devo- 
tion as be imple- 
ments with bis 
acting. 



His message states that self-dis- 
cipline, motivation and determina- 
tion will help overcome obstacles. 



Olmos survived the barrio and 
Ihe attraction of gang life. He is the 
son of an immigrant father and a 
Mexican- American mother 

Olmos has a strong belief in bis 
responsibility to give back to the 
Hispanic community, children at- 
risk and io his numerous fans. 

Olmos has received many 
awards for his humanitarian work 
including: Nostros Golden Eagle 
Special Tribute Award. John Anson 
Award and Role Model of the Year 
designation from the Colgate- 
Palmolive Co. and Hispanic 
Children's Foundation of America

tained high health standards. 

But, of course most of the physi- 
cians in this country objected to that. 
Most doctors arc 
male. From the ^^^^^^^h 
beginning, the First 
Lady was limited to 
only behaving and 
acting as a passive 



if e of the 



President 

She wrote a 
book. *'lt Takes A 
Village,'' that con- 
cerns a safe topic, 
child rearing and 
education but even 
thai received criti- 
cism during the 
1996 presidential 
campaign. But 
other than that, it 
had about as much 
impact as the Betty 
Crocker Cookbook 

It is true that ™^^^^^~ 
most doctors in the 
United states are male, so are most 
governmental legislators. Currendy, 
women here are not represented and 
are slammed whenever they do 
express their ideas. 

Too many limes when a woman 
is appointed to a high political posi- 
tion, such as Aliomey General Janet 
Reno, they arc ridiculed. Several 
months ago Reno was portrayed by a 
male actor on Saturday Night Live. 

Recently. Newt Gingrich. 
Speaker of the House, called Reno a 
■'fool'' because she had a press con- 
ference where she said she bad 
become distrustful of White House 
policies and its cooperation with the 
progress of the investigation con- 
cerning Democratic fun-raising cof- 
fee brunches. 

"She looks like a fool. I mean 
let's be honest. This is a nice lady. 
I've given her the benefit of 700 
doubts," said Gingrich. 

Gingrich exaggerates when he 
describes her attempt to express her 
progress and fuzzy areas of the 
national case by suggesting Reno 
was soft on the Presidential investi- 
gation 

Gingrich then suggests that 
Reno should resign over the matter 
because the investigation is not 
being solved immediately 

After Reno bad stated her 
"anger'' about the fund-raising activ- 
ities and the slow progress to gain 
the video tapes from the Clinlon 
administration, it seems yet again a

woman's concern for the events arc

We are sure Gingrich would want 
Reno and every other woman to 
resign and stop working. After all, 
two years ago, Gingrich was at (he

Action. Consider the source, a back-

tous yet, not any of 
us can recall this 
great scientist's 
name. 
It has already been 
rubbed out by pow- 
erful men silencing 
the voices of 
notable women. 
We believe that 
SS5S ihcse women have 
already accom- 
plished much so far as political sta- 
tions but men of equal caliber often 
restrict their progress when they 
become the center of attention. 

We have all witnessed the 
tragedy of Princess Diana. We can 
vividly remember two weeks after 
the death of Diana die popular radio 
personality "Mancow" continued to 
claim that people who were still 
mourning the loss of Princess Diana 
should gel over it because she was 
only an "elite, rich bitch " 

Yes. it was true, she had money, 
but again, the genuine sincerity of ail 
of these successful women is what 
will always overshadow men 
because men rely more so on confu- 
sion than the truth in order lo per- 
suade the masses. 

"Male pride rose to take up the 
challenge of female power; and 
launching the sex war thai was to 
divide sex and societies for millen- 
nia to come, man sought to assert his 
manhood through the death and 
destruction of all that had made 
woman the Great Mother, Goddess, 
warrior, lover and queen," wrote 
Rosalind Miles, author of "The 
Woman's History Of The World."

Religion should not dictate gay lifestyle 






To the Editor: 



I prefer cars with stick shifts 
over cars with automatic transmis- 
sions. It's a guy thing. Automatics 
are to me what sirawberry daiquiris, 
field hockey and the movie 
"Beaches" are to some men. 

"I'm glad I don't have to share a 
car with a double hemishpercciomy 
patient like you," mighl be a proba- 
ble response to die above paragraph 
But I share a van with my mom. 
Since she wanted one with automat- 
ic transmission, that is what the fam- 
ily drives 

For me, it's either drive the sis- 
symoble or walk. For the sake of 



being pragmatic, I drive that '88 
Dodge Caravan whenever Point A 
and Point B are on opposite sides of 
town. In the name of apathy. I drive 
it whenever I don't feel like walk- 
ing, which is whenever I go any- 
where I'd drive il in the house if it 
fit through the doorway. Then my 
family would say. "Mom 1 Robert 
backed over the toilet!" 

Many people have a dislike 
almost as irrational Homosexual 
behavior is what these people object 
to. It has been my observation that 



Anybody has a right to any emo- 
tion, but like my contempt for my 
mother's van, such feelings should 
not be acted on For example, it is 
okay to form opinions about some- 
one's private life but it is noi okay to 
tear down a United Sexuality's 
poster. 

Some people do not agree with 
that statement. There are a number 
of excuses used lo justify actions 
that violate the rights of gays, les- 
bians, bisexuals and straight people 
mistaken as such (A lot of people 



whenever someone accuses one of think I'm gay I'm not gay, I'm just

Ibe darker race brought in confusion 
in the different names in which 
"Blacks," themselves, referred to 
each other. "Blacks" naming of 
themselves, she believes, came from 
"Blacks" not knowing what to call 
themselves. The young woman

I remember sit-

object to the woman's use of the

my objection would not be enough 
to douse the racial education of this 
young woman's lifetime commit- 
ment to name-calling I heard. 
instead, in the background of my 
mind, my grandmother's words,

I struggled to hear her justifica-

word, "Blacks" But what does 
"Blacks" really mean to those who 
use the term. 

To some it carries a negative 
connotation, such as "Blacks don't 
know what to call themselves, so 
how are "we" (being nonblacks), to 
know what to call them?" Or 
"Blacks commit the most murders" 
as if Blacks have been allowed to

America to look beyond his visible

around, unfortunately 




Too many students are 
hoarding too many computers 



Whai's the deal with every- 
body wearing (he same clothes this 
year? Come on. you know who 
you are, don't be shy. I mean real- 
ly, Nike on everything these days. 
The hats and jackets, the shoes the 
notebooks, literally everything has 
a Swoosh on it. I checked out 
some of the prices for this mer- 
chandise and couldn't believe how 
much you people pay for this stuff. 
In fact. I'd like to know where this 
stuff is the cheapesL 

Is K-Mart the place to go? 
They actually do have inexpensive 
stuff there. I know, I know, I'm 
just not hip with what the kids are 
wearing ibis year. I'm an old man 
who grew up on corduroy pants 
and Member's Only jackets We 
wore Chuck Taylor's on our feet 
and a caps used (o bear out favorite

Times have changed. Man 
how times have changed. Michael

lo sell the Nike line. Can you 
believe that'.' I can. Look around 
you Righi now Count the mer- 
chandise. It is everywhere I'm not 
saying thai there is anything wrong 
with this. I'm just trying to under- 
stand the fad. 

I remember when concert T- 
shins were all the rave A couple of 
years ago we went through the 
"Coed Naked" thing. ThaU I have 
to admit was pretiy lame. So why 
the "Big Johnson" stuff on the 
campus 1 Whai is the deal? Please 
explain to me how this stuff is 
funny? "No Fear" from what, bad 
grades? 

A couple of years ago, Tommy 
Hilfiger sprouted up as the "cool" 
stuff to wear Now, everybody is 
wearing it. Not me, I'm jusl not 



cool I have to admit. Tommy stuff 
is nice Some of it, however, 
screams, "Look, I paid loo much 
for (his at the outlet mall!" Don't 
be offended, some of you took 
pretty good in this stuff Some of 
you. 

And what's up with the baggy 
panis? This was cool on the West 
coast in like. 1992. 1 had heard that 
the Midwest was behind a couple 
of years, especially in fashion 
Point taken Oh sure, this fashion 
will go away sooner than later. 

And whai's up with the 
designer warm up suits? Yeah. I'm 
guilty of (bis one as well as most 
of (he other things I've mentioned. 
Bui like, every day must be laun- 
dry day for some of the folks out 
there. We'll all have a closet full of 
"atliiude" T-shirts and Nike wear. 

I can see (he new trend is 70's 
wear This stuff is jusl plain awful. 
Look at picture from (his era and 
try and figure out why it is being 
wom today. Are we going in a big 
fashion cycle? Are we always 
going to be a few years behind (he 
coasts? Will we go back (o (he 80's 
again? Whai's next, parachute 
pants and the Flashdance look 
again? (The older students will ge(

Is lelevision responsible for all 
the crappy styles and fashion 
trends loday? Probably, 
Consumerism is at ils best riglu

Something else will come alone.

We arc all affected by it.

To the Editor: 

Midlerms are approaching and 1 
thought it was lime lo remind the 
siudeni body of the eiiqueiie of the 
Keitler Open Computer Labs. The 
"Ethical Guidelines for Computer 
Users." which is in the student hand- 
book and is posied in the labs, reads: 
"University computer resources 
should be used in conncaion wiih 
legitimate, universily-relaied pur- 
poses; other uses may constitute 
theft from (he university subject to 
disciplinary action as specified in 
the code." 

The use of the computer labs 
generally breaks down tmo (bree 
categories: 1) writing papers. 2) run- 
ning programs associaicd with class 



work, and 3) Internet Access. 
Internet Access include E-mail, the 
World Wide Web and Chat Rooms. 
It is the third caicgory thai is abused 
the most. 

When the Open Computer Labs 
arc busy and by my definition, thai 
is when (hey arc more than half full, 
please be polite to other students 
who need to use the computer to do 
school work. When using E-mail. 
please keep il short. Please do not 
spend hours reading, responding lo, 
or writing messages. When using 
Netscape, limit it to school research 
Netscape is noi for looking up yes- 
terday's sporis scores or seeing 
where your favorite band is playing 
next. And finally, there are very few 
legitimale reasons lo be in a Chat 



Room. Sludents with nothing else to 
do can spend hours in the computer 
Chat Rooms 

Now, I am no( saying these 
things should be banned, far from it. 
When the Computer Labs are not 
busy, there is no a-ason not to enjoy 
the IniemcL But please pay attention 
(o your surroundings. When the labs 
begin to fill up, it is time lo leave. 
And those who argue: My fees 
payed for the labs so I can do what I 
warn, try a similar argument next 
time you get a speeding ticket My 
Uxes build the roads, therefore, I 
have the right lo speed. You will not 
gel very far.

Marat-Sade to play at Williams Theatre on weekend 



By Gail Ruble Crawford 
Feature Editor 

On a typical night with nothing 
to do, you probably head to the near- 
est movie theater and pay S6 to sec 
one of the so-called "It" movies of 
the moment. Here's an original alter- 
native: why not check out what 
IPFW's School of Fine and 
Performing Arts has to offer instead? 

The School of Fine and 
Performing Arts sponsors many dif- 
ferent types of events, one of which 
is sure to please even the most dis- 
criminating r.i ■ r: 

According to Jennifer Murphy, 
Marketing and Public Relations 
Specialist for the School of Fine and 
Performing Arts, "Theatre produc- 
tions range from comedy to drama, 
satire to romance and cutung-edge 
plays to classic musicals While not 
every production will please every 
tbeater-goer. there is likely to be 
something for everyone throughout 
the course of the season." 

On Oct-17 and 18, the depart- 



ment of theatre/ Purdue -Indiana 
Theatre will present the first produc- 
tion in the 1W7-98 Mainstage 
series, a play entitled Marat-Sade 
(The Persecution and Assassi nation 
of Jean-Paul Marat as Performed by 
the Inmates of the Asylum of 
Charenton Under the Direction of 
the Marquis dc Sadc). The play 
begias at 8 pm in Williams Theatre 
and is directed by Larry L. Life. 

If you arc unfamiliar with the 
historical background of characters, 
Jean-Paul Marat was a French 
Revolutionary War hero who ruled 
the National Assembly. 

The production's program says 
that "Marat was instrumental in 
indicting and ousting his opposition, 
the Girondists, from the Assembly in 
1793, Soon after this, Charlotte 
Corday, a beaubful young woman 
from Northern France and Girondist 
sympathizer, came to Paris and 
fatally plunged a dagger into 
Marat's breast while he soaked in 
his bathtub." 

While confined in the Charenton 



Asylum from 1803 until his death in 
1814, the infamous Marquis de Sadc 
wrote and produced theatrical per- 
formances to entertain and provide 
therapy for those confined in the 
Asylum like himself The elite of 
Parisian society came to the Asylum 
to waich the "lunatics" perform. 

There is no historical evidence 
that Mann and Sadc ever met, but 
writer Peter Weiss has written an 
imaginative play-within-a-play 
about Marat's death while be is 
simultaneously involved in a philo- 
sophical debate with Sadc on the 
nature of revolution 

Marat-Sade has received both 
the Tony Award and the New York 
Critics Award for Best Play. The 
play stars John C. Hermes as the 
Marquis de Sade, Joel T. Moorman 
as Monsieur Coulmier, Gavino 
Olvcra as Jean-Paul Marat, Sarah 
Forbing as Simonne EvTard, Anna L. 
Mossburg as Charlotte Corday and 
Anthony D Anderson as DuperreL 
The play contains scenes of nudity, 
and may not appropriate for all audi-

HIV/AIDS 

Q&amp;A 



Q. Which lubricants 
are safe to use with 
condoms? 

A. Water-based 
ubricants - such as KY 
Jelly and Astroglide • 
are the only ones that 
are safe. Do NOT use 
oil-based lubricants - 
such as Vaseline, 
cooking oil, or hand 
lotion - as these 
weaken latex, making 
it likely to break.

Quaint little town breeds foul-mouthed 3rd graders 



r Nol Beckley 
Editor 



August 21, Wednesday nigbl, 10 
p in ii siaitcd. 

What was originally just a five- 
minutc video Christmas card turned 
into a phenomenon rarely seen on 
cahle television — a hit show from 
day one. There was a tremendous 
Hollywood buzz about the show for 
nearly two years until the first 
episode of "South Park" aired on 
Comedy Central. South Park is the 



first cartoon to receive television's 
TV-MA (for maiure audiences only) 
rating usually reserved for culling 
edge dramas like "NYPD Blue." 

The pilot episode created sever- 
al celebrity fans such as Tool and 
George Clooney. 

Clooney also appeared as 
"Sparky" ("Big Gay AI's Big Gay 
Boai Ride." Episode 104) He didn"t 
do anything but bark in the episode 

The six episodes being aired on 
Comedy Central have created a slir 
on ihe Internet and in college dorms 



throughout Ihe nation. IPFW is nol 
immune to this event 

At least 30 web pages have been 
devoted lo "South Park." 

The show follows ihe lives of 
four Colorado 3rd graders Kyle and 
Stan appear lo be the smartest, while 
Canman and Kenny provide most of 
the gross humor 

Rarely do Ihe children speak 
without utiehng some sort of 
obscenity, especially Kenny, the kid 
wbo no one, except those on TV, can 
understand. 



James Buchanan, senior, has 
been waichmg South Park for sever- 
al weeks 

"It's a phenomena] satire, with a 
political nature that exposes current 
issues in a unique and comical way," 
Buchanan said. 

Not everyone digs the strange, 
bizarre happenings in Ihe mountain 
town of South Park. 

"I saw pan of it, and 1 thought it 
was stupid," said Karen Goines, 
freshman. 

Created by University of 



Colorado students, Trey Parker and 
Matt Sione, Ihe show has snow- 
balled into 29 more episodes. The 
first new episode will air on Oct. 29. 
Parker and Slone promise Kenny's 
death will (op all his previous 
killings. 

Although the show takes special 
pride in being perverted and disgust- 
ing, it also covers very heavy 
themes like homosexuality and 
euthanasia. 

But it also gels into the sopho- 
moric humor of cartoon violence 



and "explosive di.urhea" 

The Oct. 29 Halloween episode 
will feature a Jesus v. Salan Pay-pce- 
view, references lo "Night of the 
Living Dead" and "Thriller" and one 
very offensive costume. 

Immediately afier, Comedy 
Central will air the "Canman Geis 
an Anal Probe" episode. New 
episodes will air every Wednesday 
afier. 

Comedy Cenlral runs South 
Park every Wednesday a! 9 p.m. and 
midnight. Sundays at 11 p.m.

Volleydons eye conference title 



By Tony Laux 
Sports Editor 

Al the halfway point in the sea- 
son womens volleyball coach Tim 
Heffron has to be happy with his 
learn, 

His team is 21-2 and 11-0 in tbe 
Great Lakes Valley Conference 
(GLVC&gt; and is eyeing another con- 
ference championship to go along 
with the three other conference 
crowns Out bis teams have won in 
ibe last four years. 

With this last weekend's two 
wins the (cam bas won ils last 33 
straight borne matches and is ranked 
#23 nationally and #3 in the region. 

Even with everything going 
well, there arc still some potential 
stumbling blocks in (he near future 
ibat could hurt the team's chances in 
securing an at-large bid to Ihe 
NCAA tournament 

At a weekend tournament being 
held at tbe University of Wisconsin, 
Parkside, the Ladydons will face "1 



Michigan Tech and #7 Lake 
Superior Stale in the same weekend 

When the GLVC tournament 
comes around n will be held al the 
Universiiy of Northern Kentucky 
which is also currently undefeated 
in the conference and won the con- 
ference title in 1995 

The Ladydons do have a strong 
nucleus wiih nine returnees from 
last year and Iwo outstanding fresh- 
men in Tami Isch, starting setter, 
and Laura Douglas, outside hitter. 

Team captains Amy Luben, 
Andi Reichhart and Tiffany Martin 
have helped lead (he team lo a 14- 
game winning streak with last loss 
coming early in Ihe season against 
Wayne Slate. 

Also the outstanding play of 
Dome Porch and Andi Reichhart 



have won each of these ladies 
Conference Player of (he Week hon- 
ors. 

Karen Brown, who must wear a 
back brace, because of an auto acci- 
dent also shows a sense of leader- 
ship by playing through an injury 
that would have seni most people (o 
Ihe bench never to return. 

Even though another 
Conference championship would be 
nice (o gel ihe focus is to do well in 
the NCAA Tournament. The team 
wenl to the NCAA Tournament last 
year but lost in the first round 

Since all of the bids mio ihe 
tournament are "al-large" Coach 
Heffron feels lhai "regional records 
and regional polls are ihe most 
important thing because it helps 
secure a spot in the tournament."
