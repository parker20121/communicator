NEWS BRIEFS 

YOU CAN HELP PUT ROSS PEROT 
ON THE PRESIDENTIAL BALLOT 

The local Ross Perot Petition Committee will be on 
the 1PF\V campus on Tuesday, April 28, to solicit peti- 
tion signatures. Signature seekers will be located in 
front of Helmke Library from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. 

Approximately 30,000 signatures from duly qualified, 
registered voters in Indiana are required to get 
Independent Pany candidate Ross Perot's name on the 
presidential state ballot in November. 

Signing the petition declares that die signer approves 
of having Perot on the ballot. It is in no way an 
endorsement of Perot or a promise of suppon, The peti- 
tion is needed to give Indiana voters the opportunity to 
vote for Perot. 

"I don't think there will be any problem getting the 
required number of signatures. Many people are dissat- 
isfied with the other choices and are interested in what 
Perot has to say. It wouldn't surprise me if we had the 
signatures within a week," said Malcolm Bender, a vol- 
unteer for the Ross Perot Petition Committee. 

The deadline for having the signatures to the appropri- 
ate county election board is July 15, 1992. The election 
board will then verify that die signatures are those of 
voters registered in that county. 

Anyone interested in helping with the committee can 
call 744-0061 after Monday, April 27. or stop by the 
local office located at 1601 Paulding Road. 



PEACE PRIZE NOMINEE TO SPEAK 
ON CHANGES IN SOUTH AFRICA 

Dame Helen Suzman, a member of the South African 
Parliament from 1953 to 1990, will discuss "South 
Africa in Transition" on Tuesday. April 28, at 7:30 p.m. 
in Neff Hall, Room lOl. Admission is free. 

"She is a significant person in the history of the oppo- 
sition to apartheid. It's an honor to bring someone of 
her stature here to IPFW, to Fort Wayne, to the commu- 
nity. It's amazing," said Van Coufoudakis, associate 
vice chancellor of academic affairs. 

Suzman led support for liberty of politically and 
socially oppressed South African peoples, and vigor- 
ously opposed legislation thai discriminated against the 
black majority. Her work drew worldwide attention to 
deplorable living conditions and prison atrocities and 
brought her two nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize. 

Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. Suzman was 
the sole representative of the Progressive Federal Party 
in parhament, presenting its anti-apartheid position on 
every issue of domestic and foreign policy, in a climate 
of intense hostility. 

"Over the past 40 years, Dame Suzman has fiercely 
fought apartheid, sometimes singlehandedly." said Gary 
Blumenshine, chair and associate professor of history. 

"Her presence here benefits us because she is a sym- 
bol of our values-freedom, Itbeny, and opposition of 
discrimination," said Blumentine. 

Suzman's appearance is supported by the Indiana 
University Institute for Advanced Studies, and the 
IPFW Faculty Senate Lecture Series Subcommittee.

Senate complains about paper; club's constitution passed 



By Child nesting 
Managing Editor 

The Communicator was 
sharply criticized by an IPFW 
student scnaior last week, for 
using what she called "sexist 
terminology." 

Holly Prangcr, a student sena- 
tor, referred lo an April 16 
Communicator article on the 
student senate when she said she 
regarded "The Communicator's 
sexist language as a personal 
insult," and that she "doesn't 
want the student body getting 
the wrong impression about sen- 
ate." 

Pnuiger made these statements 
at the weekly student senate 
meeting on April 17. 



Pninger was speaking of a line 
in the article that read, "A sena- 
tor may then address the senate 
to argue why he should remain 
on the senate." She went on to 
tell the meeting that she planned 
to write a resolution condemn- 
ing the Communicator for sexist 
language. 

According to the Associated 
Press Slylebook, the copy edit- 
ing guide used by most newspa- 
pers, including The Commun- 
icator, the use of the pronoun 
"fiis" is preferred to using "him 
or her." 

The Slylebook reads, "Do not 
presume maleness in construct- 
ing a sentence, but use the pro- 
noun his when an indefinite 



antecedent may be male or 
female. EitampJe: A reporter 
attempts to protect his source, 
not his or her sources." 

Other senate business 

The senate approved the con- 
siiluiion of a new student group, 
while another constitution was 
tabled for revisions. 

The new Honors Club had its 
constitution passed. The Honors 
Club was established for stu- 
dents in the Honors program at 
IPFW. A grade point average of 
over 3.0 is required for voting 
membership, according to its 
constitution, 

Campus organizations commit- 
tee chair Kent Jakway recom- 
mended that the constitution of 



the new group Fighting 
Ideologies Resistant to 
Equality, or FIRE, be tabled to 
correct "structural and grammat- 
ical errors." 

FIRE was created as a forum 
for discussion of feminist issues. 
Jakway pledged lo meet with a 
representative from the group to 
iron out problems before the 
next senate meeting. 

After a voie on the funding of 
a Computer Book Exchange 
Network advenisemeni, Elbert 
Webster questioned the senate's 
assistance to the new program. 

During ihe senate's "Good of 
the Order" comments, Webster 
staled, "I feel that we've spent 
loo much time and energy 



already. Wc don't need lo hand- 
hold this projccL" 

"(CBEN) is Jim (Krusc's) pro- 
ject. Senate business belongs lo 
the senate," added Webster. 

Krusc created the CBEN com- 
puter program. 

Victoria Vinson disagreed 
with Webslcr. "It's important we 
help out a student ... that's what 
we're here for," she said. 

John Wciscnburger asked the 
assembled senators to come with 
him to the IFSGA offices after 
the meeting had concluded. 
Wciscnburger said ihere was a 
need to complete committee 
work and work on the student 
discount package.

Tips for graduates 

Good resume key to 
getting job interviews 



By Janet Ausbury 
Staff Writer 

Well-written resumes and 
cover letters may not guarantee 
jobs for IPFW graduates, but 
they are an important first step. 
according to Linda Scott, associ- 
ate director of Career Services. 

Scott said that a good resume 
should meet three criteria: it 
must be organized, professional, 
and dynamic. 

Organization is important 
because the resume is simply a 
thumbnail sketch of what die job 
seeker has done. "It shouldn't be 
your Lfc story." said Scott. "The 
average resume gets 30 seconds 
of scan time from the person 
who is reading it." 

If the resume is clutiercd or 
difficult to road. Ihe resume will 
not be read. 

The resume should look pro- 
fessional because "it is an image 
on paper of the person sending 
it." said Scott. The paper should 
be clean and the text free of 
typographical errors. 

Scott described a dynamic 
resume as being results-oriented. 
Job-seekers should not only 
include their job experience, but 
also indicate what has been 
^iccomplished in those Jobs. 
"Employers want to know how 
you benefited the company," 
advised Scon. 

Resumes should list job experi- 
ence which is relevant to the 
graduate's major and chosen 
field of work. 

"If you liavc worked in a field 
relevant 10 your major, this tells 
employers thai you are interest- 
ed in that particular industry and 
you understand its strengths and 
weaknesses." said Scott. 

Cover letters arc the other half 



&gt;. Scott stressed that 
resumes should never be sent 
without cover Ictlcrs. 

According to Scott, a good 
cover letter should be cus- 
tomized to the company receiv- 
ing it. The letter should be 
addressed lo a specific person, 
not just "Dear Sir or Madam." 

Names should be spelled cor- 
rectly and correct tides used. If 
the letter writer is not sure how 
to spell a name or whether the 
recipient is a Mr., Ms. or Mrs., 
the writer should call the compa- 
ny to verify ihe name and ddc. 

Scou outlined the structure a 
cover letter should take. The 
first paragraph should tell why 
the recipient has been sent the 
resume. If the job seeker is 
responding lo an ad in the paper, 
or was referred by a friend, or 
heard of the job el.scwhcrc, the 

"The average resume 
gels 30 seconds of scan 
time from the person who 
is reading it," 
-Linda Scott 

first paragraph should indicate 
this. 

The second paragraph should 
tell how the writer fits the needs 
of the company and/or ihe par- 
ucular job. This is an opportuni- 
ty for writers to describe iheir 
skills and benefits lo the 
prospective employer. 

Writers should also tell why 
they arc interested in working 
for this particular company. 
prove knowledge about the com- 
pany, and how the applicant 
researched the information. 

The third paragraph should 
request an interview. Instead of 
writing, "I look forward to hear- 



ing from you," the writer should 
close the letter by saying the 
company will be contacted in a 
few days and a request for an 
interview will be made at that 
time. 

Scott poinlcd out that compa- 
nies receive too many resumes 
to be able to respond lo all the 
requests for interviews. In addi- 
tion, requesting an interview 
gives the job seeker an edge, 
'This makes you look organized 
and assertive." said Scott 

Scott cauUoned job seekers to 
be realistic about their goals, 
"You're not going lo land a job 
that pays S50.000 a year right 
out of school, and you won't be 
president of the company," 

Job hunters should also prepare 
to put lime and effort into the 
search. Scott recalled studenis 
she worked with who sent out 
20 to 30 resumes and cover let- 
ters before snaring a single 
interview. 

"Years ago, 98 percent of grad- 
uates had jobs in their field 6 
months after graduating," said 
ScoiL "Now, 98 percent of grad- 
uates have Jobs in their field 
maybe 9 to 12 months after 
graduating." 

Scott urged students to take 
advantage of the resume assis- 
tance, career counseling, and 
placement assistance offered by 
Career Services. Any staff mem- 
ber can help studenis with cover 
letters and resumes. 

Scott docs not want students to 
be overly pessimistic about 
today's tough job market. 
"Everyone is facing a longer 
search," she said, "bui-therc arc

ill sponsor a festival in 

honor of Earth Day on Sunday, 

Apnl 26. 

Eanh Day began in 1970. 

David van Guilder, Chairman 
of the Fort Wayne Earth Day 
Committee, said there are many 
theories on die actual creation of 
Earth Day. 

Guilder said while every Earth 
Day celebration has an underly- 
ing focus on awareness or edu- 
cation, each celebration has its 
own purpose. 

'The focus this year has really 
been on solid and hazardous 
waste disposal, since they are 
such major local issues," said 
Guilder. 

This Sunday's festival will fea- 
ture many guest speakers, along 
with musicians, and information 
booths, and the opportunity to 
participate in games, according 
to Guilder. 

David Motrin, an environmen- 
tal specialist for Channel 33, 
will open the days events at 
noon. 

"My basic goal with the news 
packages is getting people to 
understand they don't have to 
wail for the government to cre- 
ate change," he said. 

"The most powerful 
environmental tool is the 
dollar bill." 
-David Morrin 

"The most powerful environ- 
mental tool is the dollar bill. By 
not spending in companies that 
aren't environmentally safe, peo- 
ple can make a difference," said 
Morrin. 

Kent Dctter, a guitarist in the 
band Acoustic Blues, volun- 
teered lo play at the festival. 

Dctter said Earth Day is impor- 
tant because it's a way of edu- 
cating ourselves. 

"I think it's something they 
should have in ihe schools. 
Educating our children is the 
most important thing wc can 
do," said Dcuer, 

Besides the events to be held 
on the main stage, there arc sev- 
eral programs to be held in vari- 
ous rooms in Walb Memorial 
Union. 

Gene Gran, the Director of the 
Whitley County Material 
Recovery Plant, will discuss his 
plant's recycling program. 

Gran said the lypc of program 



used at his facility is very 
unique. There are only about 
100 plants like his across the 
country. Most of the plants arc 
automated, but Gran's facihiy is 
noL 

All of die sorting and separat- 
ing of the materials is done by 
the people at the plant, and not 
by the consumer. 

The material recovery facility 
separates the waste into 22 
categories, 

"I hope to explain how this 
type of recycling program 
works, and why it is the best 
method of recycling," said Gran. 

Gran said. "Our greatest chal- 
lenge was 10 put together some- 
thing 27,000 people could 
afford." 

"Our greatest challenge 
was to put together some- 
thing 27,000 people could 
afford."

Edwin Rousseau, chairman of 
the Allen County Solid Waste 
district, will speak at die festival 
on environmental policies. 

Rousseau said important issues 
being dealt widi each Earth Day 
are ever changing. He said. 
"Trying to stay abreast of that is 
a constant struggle. The main 
\hnisi now is a solid waste plan." 

An advocate for public irans- 
portaiion, Charly Wilier has an 
interesting proposal for Fort 
Wayne iransportauon. 

Wilier said. "PTC is going 
down and Fort Wayne will try to 
widen roads to accommodate all 
die cars. 

"Wc need a way to move people 
not ears.' said Wilier, 

Wilier said having a trolley 
system would be more environ- 
mentally sound. 

"Fort Wayne has a lot of 
reverse commuters, people are 
moving in all directions during 
rush hour. This makes it harder 
to control and direct traffic." 

An environmental affairs advi- 
sor for the Hoosier Environ- 
mental Council, Tom Dustin, 
said. "I think Earth Day is 
important as a reminder of our 
continuing responsibility." 

"Earth Day will be a success if 
only 10 percent of the people 
remember what they learn and 
join the long-iemi commitment," 
said Dustin. 

Reducing, reusing and recy- 
cling arc some of the ways peo- 
ple can help the environment 
because Earih Day is not Just 
Wednesday. April 22; it is every 
day.

Independents deserve 
a place on fall ballots 



American voiers are wiuiessing a unique 
siory unfolding in presidential politics. 

This year iliree candidates are keeping 
pace wiUi Uie Democratic and Republican 
front-runners. All can be labelled "political 
outsiders," as all three began tlicir cam- 
paigns outside of llic traditional D.C.-sialc- 
liouse power bell. 

Wlial is unique about them is that ihey arc 
the survivors. The uadiiional politicians 
have dropped oul. Publicly, Tsongas, 
Wilder, Harkin. etc. will admit llicir funds 
dried up. Wliai they won't admit is that 
iheir funds did nol dry up because ihey had 
something urgent or dangerous lo say lo tlie 
public. Bill Clinton emerged as ihe froni- 
runncr on ihc basis of "e lee lability" alone, 
and not real issues. 

So we arc left willi Clinton and President 
Bush, wliilc Pat Buchanan, Jeny Brown, 
and Ross Perot follow doggedly behind. 
The fact thai each is still running has 
exposed the gaping holes in traditional 
Democrat-Republican poliiical lliinldng. 

Pal Buchanan was the first lo make a dent. 
Buchanan galvanized ihe right-wing 
Republican vote in iJie early primaries, Tlic 
conservative Republicans that fueled the 
Reagan revoluiion in ihc 80s made tlicir 
distrust of Bush plain. 

To ihem, Bush is a laxer and a slave to tlie 
multinationals. They think he is soft on 
Japanese trade barriers. Buchanan's per- 
centages arc a tally of Republicans that feel 
"America First" and "no new taxes" is good 
govcmmcnl. 

Jeny Brown's victories have been victo- 
ries of form and potential, his candidacy ran 
for months on a concept: no campaign 
pledges over $100. 

When Brown outlasted Tsongas lo lake 
second place in the Democratic race, 
Americans considered Ihc possibilities. No 
PAC money, no corporate manipulation of 
candidates' funds. Genuine ideas could 
appear in campaigns iunded by the 
populace. 

Ross Perot, tlie most popular of the three. 



is Brown turned inside-out. Perot Kas 
pledged SiOO niijlion towards his own can- 
didacy, provided volunteers can get his 
name on tlie ballot in all the states. 

The danger of Perot's privately financed 
run is obvious. Presidential politics would 
become the province of a Democrat candi- 
date, a Republican candidate, and any num- 
ber of multi-mi Ihonaires who want the big 
prize for ilieir mantels. 

Nonetheless, Perot's ideas are as much his 
as his money. If Perot and his plans can 
stand up to scmiiny, he deserves to be in the 
race. 

To avoid making these three men too 
heroic, remember that they arc all very 
flawed candidates. Buchanan seems to rec- 
ognize no interest but ihai of the white 
American male. While people, Buchanan 
told the London Sunday Telegraph, is "who 
we are. Thai's where America comes 
from." 

Brown's foreign policy Js almost non- 
existent. His flat-tax proposition and capi- 
tal-gains tax elimination make a double 
handout to Ihe upper class. 

Perot claims he can raise SIOO billion lo 
dump in the deficit hole through sUicler tax 
collection practices. His plan for public 
"electronic town halls" is elitist, not to 
mention manipulative. Perot needs to kill 
tliai one now. 

These three men have all proven their 
appeal to disenfrancliised American voters, 
and ihcy deserve places on die ballot in the 
fall. If we have no third party, wc must sup- 
port five contenders. 

They need help, though. Be ready to sign 
or circulate a Perot or Buchanan petition, 
should one come to you. Call up 1-800- 
426-1112 10 contribute ten bucks to 
Brown's war chest. 

Such contributions are not votes. They 
prove that the nation is emiched by sup- 
porting more voices in the national arena. 




'92 election 

Bush and Clinton make 
Perot look appealing 



By Jim Walker 
Editor in Chief 

When the race for president began to heal 
up this past winter, I started following 
things like a sports fan. 

1 rooted for ihe underdogs, Buchanan and 
Brown. I knew tliey wouldn't win, I knew 
there wouldn't be any last-second shoi to 
pull tliem tluough. But I was tooling. 

Now, I've realized this is no game. And 
there is np team I'm really interested in 
rooting for. 

Presideni Bush certainly is not the man I 
want runmng the show again. He spent this 
first term manipulating the popularity polls, 
"1 wonder how many points I'd go up if we 
won a war," Bush may have diought. 

Well, his ratings are falling now. His pop- 
ularity conscious soft shoe has helped put 
ihis nation in a hole. Does Bush know what 
to do lo get us oul? No. 

Okay, vote Democrat. We've got wonder- 
boy Bill Clinton on the jackass ticket. I 
diink diis is a good spot for a list. 

Five Reasons Clinton Can't Be Trusted: 1 . 
Jennifer Flowers 2. Draft Dodging 3. Nol 
inhaling 4. He's always been a politician 5. 
He'd lie to his mother to save face. 

Clinton looks like a politician. He smells 
like a politician. He reeks with ihe scent of 
campaign contributions from people and 



organizations who arc nol interested in the 
ideals of the Democratic party. 

So wc arc left to decide between Bush and 
Clinton, boili dogs. But there's H. Ross 
Perot, the darling of "Lany King Live." 

I saw Perot last week on King's television 
talk show and Perot sounded different. He 
didn't talk like a politician. He said some- 
thing about the president and congress 
pulling up their sleeves and working logetJi- 
cr one problem at a lime until this country 
was fixed up. Presidents can'i do that stuff. 
They've got photo ops and fly fishing in the 
afternoon. Ford Theatre at night. Work wiiJi 
congress? Hah. 

But if anybody can do il, Perot is the man. 
He earned his billions, making ilic right 
investments after working hard as a sales- 
man at IBM. Nobody handed Perot his 
money, his future. Bill Clinlon said he 
always wanted to be president. He has 
always been a politician. Clinton has 
always been inside the system. And Bush is 
l!ie system. 

My underdogs arc oul of die pennant race. 
Buchanan is just playing oul the fourth 
quarter junk lime. Brown is hoping for five 
three-pointers in the final minute. Won't 
liappen. 

But Perot can still happen.

esponding to Ihe Ici 
"Choice is Ours Alone" by J.

whether or not an unborn baby 
should be considered a person. 
She asked "... can it be said

responded to that very question in 
"Abortion Questions and Answers." 
■Thai [can il be said acorns ate

call an infant an aduli?' Raihcf, you 
must ask, 'are ihey both complcie

needs to develop into an adult tree is 
time and nourishment. The same 
with an unborn baby. All of the 
genetic infarmalion necessary to 
build a child's body/brain is present 
at the momcni of conception. 
Nothing will be added to ihai 
unique individual from the momcni 
of conception cxccpl nourishment."

ties icstincd. This is laken from the 
official Senate repori, 97ih

ogists, and other scieniisis agree ihal 
conception marks the ticgicming of 
Ihe life of a human being — a being 
that is alive and is a member of Ihe 
human species. There is over- 
whelming agreement on litis point 
in countless medical, biological, and 
scienlific writings," 

If the baby inside his mother's 
womb is not a person, then why can 
he feel pain, dream (5 months), suck

and hiccup (ducc monlhs). normally 
"breathe" and swallow the fluid in

When saline abortions are done 
(usually in Ihe 4-7lh month when 
the baby is completely developed) 
the inner organs and the baby's 
outer skin are severely bumed, Il 
can take up lo two hours for the 
baby 10 die: some women have testi- 
fied lhat during that two-hour period 
they could feci their baby thrashing, 
kicking, and writhing inside of them 
after the saline injection. 

When a suction abortion is per- 
formed, portions of the baby's body 
are lorn off and suctioned away and 
then to end the procedure, forceps 
arc used to crush the baby's skull so 
it will fit through the nanow suction 
lube. (Taken from "Aboriion As 
Your Option" by D. Monahan &amp; K. 
SuUivon-Ables) 

Dr. H.M. Liley, Ihe leading 
authority on ihe study of babies 
before birth, stated "When doctors 
first began invading the soncluaiy of 
the womb, they did nol know that 
the un))om baby would react to pain 
in Ihe same fashion as a child 
would. Bui Ihcy soon teamed Ihal 
he would." Jusl as someone were to 
tear off one of your limbs al this 
very moment, so does a child in the 
womb feel Ihal same pain.

In the book by Dr. and Mrs,

why pregnant women do not "feel"

THE COMMUNICATOR 



Year in review 



IPFW students are 'benign,' 'disinterested' 



TotheEdilor: 

As ihis academic year draws to a 
close I find myself reficcling upon 
Ihc pjsi nine months at IPFW. 

Never in all of my years in and 
around college campuses (yes. 
Ihcy are loo many) have I ever 
witnessed such a benign and disin- 
tcrcsicd community of siudenls, 

Wc have a student newspaper 
which, in the pasi. was — affcction- 
alcly or not so affcclionaicly — 
referred lo as "The Fornicator." 
This year, however, this good- 
newspaper has not engaged in 
enough journalistic activism to 
allow for even that epithet. 

The students' government spent 
nearly the entire year bogged 
down, yei again, in die quagmire 
of impeachment. Rather than 
addressing die concerns and issues 
on this'campus, our "student lead- 
ers" spent Ihcir lime engaging in 
inlcUcctual genocide and mental 
masturbation. It is they who 
deserve the label of "fornicators" 
as ilie entire year was wasted by a 
students' government f****** 
around, f"***** each other (liter- 
ally and figuratively), and ulti- 
mately f****** each of us. 

This year, as last, wc still have an 
understaffed, underpaid, and 
dcmorahzcd pohce force. We still 
are without a chief of police to 
replace ihe former chief who 
resigned last year. 

Faculty and staff continue lo be 
paid niggardly wages, forcing 
many of them to prostitute them- 
selves to outside interests in order 
10 make a living wage. 

Course offerings have been 
decreased, class sizes have been 
increased, and student services 
curtailed or eliminated. 

Now we find thai even our typ- 
ing faciiiiies in Helmke Library 
are to be eliminated. 

In return we have been given 
unprecedented increases in tuition 
and student service fees. We are 
being made to pay more for less 
and no one is questioning why. 

This campus's administration has 
turned its back on not only its fac- 
ulty and staff, but on its students. 
Our administrators refuse to 
address the life- threatening epi- 
demic of AIDS other dian through 
rhetoric. 

When high schools throughout 
this nation are distributing or mak- 
ing available condoms, our admin- 
istrators refuse the students on this 
campus this same consideration. 

Study rooms and facihties have 
been eliminated and yet our 
administrators refuse to extend the 
hours of accessibility at our 
student union, thereby forcing 
students into studying at area 
restaurants. 

Campus safety has been virtually 
ignored. While wc have been pro- 
vided "emergency phones," the

Full-time faculty are being 
denied the opportunity to teaeh

Sexism, racism, and homcsexism 
is allowed to not only exist, but 
flourish as witnessed by our 



administrators' unwillingness to 
defend victims of discrimination at 
the hands of students' govemment 
and to allow for (and I would sug- 
gest sanction through silence) dis- 
crimination of individuals based 
on sexual orientation as witnessed 
in tliis campus's student code. 
The fact that these issues and 
concerns have been allowed to 
continue unchecked, and for the 
most part, go unnoticed by your 
student newspaper and students' 
govemment is an outrage. The fact

Nuptial season opens 

Don't invite me to your damn wedding 



By Chnd Hesling 
Managing Editor 

1 was pecking ahead on my "Far 
Side" desk calendar loday. I Didn't 
flip any more llian a few pages 
before I realized ihat May 1 was 
coming up. 

Hcllfirc! May 1. The opening of 
wedding season. 

To every iliing there is a season, 
lum, lum, lum. Hockey has a season. 
Clu-istmas has a season, Deer have a 
season when bubbas don camouflage 
duds, hop in camouflage-painted 
pickups, and shoot at their heads. 
Yes, weddings have a season, loo. 

Wedding season in Indiana begins 
May 1 and ends November I. The 
rest of the year is loo cold to have 
weddings. Or so ihink ihc bride and 
groom. 

The siarry-eyed couple envision a 
bright, breezy afternoon in June 
when they choose iheir dale. They 
imagine themselves dancing out into 
the bright sunshine into a hail of 
rice. Birds sing. Apple blossoms fall 
from ilie trees. Everyone seniles. 

What actually happens is a heal 
wave. All of Sol's rays hone in on 
that little Missouri Synod 
Methopiscoiarian church on the 
wedding day. Organ keys slick. 
Sweat worms its way from your 
armpit lo your belt line. Grandma's 
dress sticks unashamedly to her 
thighs. Two girls faint. The rice 
clumps in the box. 

Not a pretty picture, eh? The prob- 
lem with weddings is expectations. 
Everyttiing has to be so picturc-per- 
feci-pretty. When something is not, it 
seems amplified to the lendi degree. 
The mammodi preparations enlarge 
those expectations. To help the 
bride-io-be on her way, there is 
"Bride's" magazine. "Bride's" dou- 
bles as a help and a curse. 
"Bride's" is thicker than ihe Fort 



Wayne phone book. This month. 
Every month. Inside "Bride's" arc 
300 bridal gowns, every one of litem 
the same shade of white. "Bride's" 
has also thrown in 200 off-whilc 
gowns, and 100 beige ones, for 
variety. 
Bridesmaids' outfits aren't a lot 
better. 




Shoes have to be dyed to match, too. 

Aside from the color, bridesmaid 
dresses are simple. They have to be 
homemade, shapeless, and butt ugly. 
Then the bride slicks the brides- 
maids with the bill that they'll resent 
for the rest of her life. 

The groom's got it much easier. He 
.gels a couple of his lunkhead bud- 
dies together and they all gel pen- 
guin suits at the reni-a-iux shop. 
They don't even step into a pair of 
pants there — a guy with a tape mea- 
sure docs all that. They go get drunk, 
and the tux arrives in a plastic bun- 
dle on wedding day. No problem.. 

Relatives come around with fools' 
questions before the big day. 
Presents: "Where are you regis- 
tered?" Wal-Man. "Have you picked 
out a silverware pattern? ' Who 
cares? The other end is ilie business 
end. 

Everyone winds up giving them a 
Mr. Coffee anyway.

Colors, bands, preachers, flower 
girls, ring bearers ... it gets lo be loo 
much for the happy loving couple. 
By the lime wedding day rolls 
around, bodi arc so ten,se dial if diey 
touched each other, they'd snap in 
two. 

Finally, the blessed day arrives. 
You can get out of it, maybe, if you 
try this liide trick I dcvised. 

Come through die door, all duded 
up, fake present in hand. I approach 
the bride and ask. "Is this the one 
dial's gonna take?" 

"What?" she says. 

"Is this marriage gonna lake? I 
don't want to waste my time loday!" 

"Ulili ... I, ulili ... " she stammers. 

"No, no. You hesitated too long," I 
reply. 'The hell with it. I'll just come 
lo your next wedding." Then you 
head out the door, and your after- 
noon's free. I've ducked several of 
diem thai way. 

That sounds cold, but weddings are 
all the same. Always there's some 
cousin of die bride singing tlie same 
damn wedding songs: "The Rose," 
"Three Times a Lady," "Endless 
Love." "Widi You I'm Bom Again," 
or thai "Whenever Two of Us are 
Joined Togedier in His Name There 
is Love" song. This cousin sang in 
high school choir, now she's Maria 
Calias. Siidown already. 

The preacher always gives the 
same sermon, too. The good rev- 
erend turns theological somersaults 
trying to convince the crowd that 
Ephesians 5:22 ("Wives, submit 
yourselves unto your own husbands, 
as unto ihe Lord.") doesn't actually 
mean what it says it does. 

Then there's ihe reception. The 
bride and groom have a mental pic- 
ture of the wedding reception in 
"The Deer Hunter" as their model. 
Lots of dancing, riotous laughter, 
heavy drinking, edinic costumes ... 



die works. 

Instead, what they gel is die usual 
ham-and-iurkey deli trays, old aunts 
yelling that the music's too loud, 
beer that runs out too fast, or worse, 
none at all. 

The oh-so-cute bride and groom, 
loopy from taking two hours wordi 
of wedding pictures, inevitably 
smear each other's faces widi wed- 
ding cake frosting. Those wacky 
kids. In their hearts, tliey'd rather 
smear it on their in-laws" faces. 

It was at a borcpile reception like 
that one where I met this red-haired 
woman. I was spitting in the punch- 
bowl when she came up to me. 
"What are you doing?" she cried. 

"Sorry," I slammcred. "1 can't help 
it. I hale weddings. I'd rather go lo a 
funeral. At least diere you know die 
loved one's suffering has ended." 

She laughed in spite of herself. 
"Y'know. you're right," she said. "It 
was so damn hot in there! Those 
songs diat woman sang! The dresses 
were ugly, and diose polyester tuxes 
were nasty. I could have touched a 
match to die groomsman and melted 
itrighioff his body." 

I nodded. "We 're out of beer, loo." 

At lhat, the red-haired woman 
looked around a few limes, dien spat 
in die punchbowl. 

So die moral of this story is: Don't 
invite me to your damn wedding. 
Don't have one at all. 

Run down to the courthouse and 
gel one of Uieir IS-dollar jobs. Save 
everyone a lot of pain and suffering. 
And Mr. Coffee's.

consecutive matches against the 
Buckeyes. Ohio Slate was able to hold

kills in the match. 

Norman Almodovar had 12 kills. 
Lloy Ball added nine, along with his 
JO assists. Ball once again led the learn 
in digs with seven.

Tournament MVP. Joining Ball on the 
ali-lourncy team was Neil Day,

Wisconsin-Milwaukee on Friday by 
scoresof 15-12, 15-9. and 15-7, 

Against 14-11 Wisconsin-

rosier. Papaleo led the Volleydons with 
16 kills, and Qucntin Spiegel and

Winning the MIVA tournament, 
combined widi a 6-0 record in MIVA 
conference play, all but guaranteed tlie 
27-7 Volleydons a chance to belter last 
season's third place finish in the 
NCAA Final Four. 

IPFW will face No. 1 seed and 
second-ranked Stanford (23-3) in the 
semifinal round on Friday at 7:30 p.m,

in ihe other semifinal matchup. The

have been brisk, and siudcnis wishing 
to cheer the Volleydons to victory 
should not delay. 

The Volleydons enter the Final Four 
Tournament on a winning streak. 
IPFW has won 17 of its last 19 
matches. In doing so, the Volleydons 
have held their opponents under 30 
percent hitting efficiency. 

History, however, is against the 
Volleydons. In 20 of die last 22 NCAA 



Tournament championship matches, 
California teams have vied for the 
crown. 

The Volleydons have proved to be 
much more of a nemesis to the 
California teams this season, 
compiling an 8-4 record versus ihc 
Wesl Coast, Also, the Volleydons 
appearance last season gives ihem 
more experience than any of the teams 
competing. 



Foundation of dynasty laid 



By Joe Heersche 
Sports Editor 

Many universities throughout 
Indiana have fielded great collegiate 
sports teams, in some cases creating a 
dynasty in a certain sport. 

The Fighting Irish of Notre Dame 
have won football national 
championships, and nurlured Heisman 
Award winning athletes all under the 
tutelage of great coaches such as 
Knute Rockne, Ara Parseghian, and 
Lou Holiz. 

Behind legend Bob Knight, the 
Indiana Hoosiers have won national 
championships in three of four Final 
Four appearances. Also they have 
consistently finished at the top of the 
Big Ten conference. 

IPFW Sports 
Spotlight 

The Volleydons from IPFW. 
following in these great tradifions. 
have begun to dominate volleyball in 
the Midwest and East, and now arc 
competing at the highest levels across 
the nation. 

For the second consecutive year. 
IPFW has reached the volleyball Final 
Four. The Volleydons enter the 
tournament with the most wins of any 
team competing, netting 27 on the 
season. 

And this may only be the beginning 
of a volleyball dynasty for IPFW. 
Many of the siariers are freshmen and 
sophomores. These include Lloy Ball. 
Felipe Ralai, and Norman Almodovar. 
Craig Collins, also an underclassman, 
has great potential and will take 
extensive playing experience into next 
season.

^ Scary ^ 
"igl Tweezers^ 



The Volleydons will lose seniors 
Neil Day, Mike Stciner, and Juan 
Ortiz, but with the winning program 
coach Arnic Ball has established. 
recruiting will noi be a problem. With 
the winning team comes a powerful 
nicruiung tool, able to interest players 
from Puerto Rico, and even into 
enemy territory such as California. 
Chad Blatchlcy is one example of 
Ball's ability to recruit from 
California. 

1994 should also ^.rove to be an 
added inccnuve to the Volleydons, as 
the NCAA Final Four brings their 
tournament to JPFW's back yard (the 
Memorial Coliseum). Lloy Ball will 
be a senior in what should be his most 
prolific year. 

Many teams, coaches, and volleyball 
magazines now have concluded that 
IPFW is a legitimate volleyball power. 
Coach Arnie Ball has created yet 
another great collegiate sports learn 
for the state of Indiana. As siudcnis 
and sports fans, we should be aware 
that this is happening at our campus.
