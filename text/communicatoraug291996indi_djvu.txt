Ryan deciding future on campus 



Considers legal action 



by Paul Tupper 

Editor and 

Nol Berkley 

Managing Editor 

Former associate faculty member. 
Jack Ryan, has chosen not to return 
to IPFW this semester. 
Ryan submitted a grievance with IPFW 
when his contract was not renewed after the 



1995 spring semester During that semester, 
one of his students, Joyce Gaines, filed an 
informal complaint with the university 
claiming Ryan made racist comments, 

Ryan, who suffers from emphysema, 
cites health reasons for not reluming to cam- 
pus. 

"I'm just physically nol able to (teach)." 
said Ryan. 

According to Ryan, a job was not 



MlCOMt TO 




offered to him, but he believes an offer was 
about to be made. Mary Scudder, coordina- 
tor of human services, would not comment 
if a job was about to be offered to Ryan. She 
would say that she and Ryan discussed the 
issue. 

Chancellor Michael Wanell is pleased 
Purdue President Steven Beering decided to 
lei IPFW determine Ryan's future. 

"This really is a campus-level decision," 
said Wartell. "The 
grievance procedure 
slates a decision 
must be made by the 
president of 

Purdue," he added.

Students stroll the campus, unofficially ending summer. 



Ryan is not satisfied with the outcome, 
which some would say ended in his favor. 

"I'm not pleased he (Beering) still thinks 
the process by which 1 was created isn't 
wrong," said Ryan, who is contemplating 
suing for damages and legal expenses. 

"I'm also hoping to prevent this same 
situation from happening to other teachers." 
he added. 

The committee which heard Ryan's 
grievance recommended granting his griev- 
ance and reinstating him to his previous 
position. The panel said IPFW failed to fol- 
low proper guidelines when they didn't 
reappoint Ryan for the subsequent semester. 
Beering denied Ryan's grievance but 



said the university could hire Ryan back if 
they wanted to. Beering also said the uni- 
versity did nothing wrong when they decid- 
ed not to rehire Ryan. Ryan had no rights to 
employment because he was a non-tenured 
instructor. 

Ryan has repeatedly said he was inform- 
ing members of the class to identify them- 
selves by name in a speech or else be 

remembered only by their looks. 

Ryan admitted to referring to Gaines as 

a "big, black woman" once. Gaines said he 

called her a "big, black woman" three limes. 
Ryan had taught at IPFW for 11 years 

before the spring semester of 1995.

ETS website aids students 



by Jeremy Ecenbarger 
News Editor 

Students will no longer have to 
pick up a pen and fill out the hun- 
dreds of papers that are required to 
receive information from surround- 
ing colleges or to sign up for place- 
ment exams and the SATs. A new 
program has been offered over the 
Internet (hat does this all with the 
tap of a key. 

In July, the Educational Testing 
Service (ETS) announced thai a new 
World Wide Website is available to 
students, parents and educators as a 
"one-stop" educational resource net- 
work. 

ETS is the world's largest pri- 
vate educational measurement insti- 
tution and a leader in educational 
research 

The new websile, which started 
in May, contains a wealth of infor- 
mation on major testing programs 
like the Graduate Record 

Examination Board's General and 
Subject Tests, the Policy Council's 
Test of English as a Foreign 
Language exam, the Graduate 
Management Admission Council's 
program and the Praxis Series. 
These tests are required for accep- 
tance within several colleges. 

There are also convenient links 
throughout the site thai connect 
users to the College Board and its 
website, College Board Online, for a 
large amount of information regard- 
ing the SAT I and II and Advanced 
Placement exams. 

"We design the tests, adminis- 
ter them, grade them and distribute 
tbem for you," said Tom Ewing, a 
member of the ETS team. 

Information is also available in 



association with Financial aid for 
education, careers and jobs, learning 
and technology and free Windows- 
based software which can be down- 
loaded. An online magazine is 
included and a store is at hand to 
order ETS publications, software 
and lest preparation print and soft- 
ware products. 

"The publications from the col- 
leges are often free, otherwise they 
can be ordered with a VISA or 
Mastercard," said Ewing. 

Online test registration is avail- 
able for several tests and will be 
expanded in the future. 

"ETS Net embodies the ETS 
'Learning for Tomorrow' theme. We 
have applied technology in a new 
and different way to communicate 
directly wilb test lakers, studenis 
and adults making education and 
career choices and institutions thai 
use lest scores in their decision- 
making process," said Pamela 
AJden, vice president of Marketing 
and ETS. 

The network also allows users 



to search through an ETS Tests and 
Services Directory by topic, pro- 
gram, or alphabetically. Some gen- 
eral topics range from Career 
Planning, Financial Aid and 
Scholarship Programs to 

Professional Developments for 
Teachers and Instructional 
Software. Users can find schools 
throughout ihe country that offer 
their specified major and receive 
detailed information about the cam- 
pus. 

"Whether someone's looking to 
get information to register for an 
admissions test for college or gradu- 
ate school, or needs help planning 
and preparing for education or a 
career, or is looking for teaching 
resources or the latest research, they 
should check oul the ETS Net site 
for information or a link to a related 
site," said Alden, 

The new websile can be 
accessed over Ihe Internet al

On June 28, Albino M. Perez. 
campus clinical assistant professor 
of dental laboratory technology, was 
named 1996 Educator of the Year by 
the National Association of Dental 
Laboratories (NADL). 

NADL is an association of den- 
tal laboratories from across ihe 
nation. They honored Perez for his 
"outstanding contributions to the 
fuiure of denial technology through 
education. " 

"My primary concern are my 
studenis," said Perez. "I always 
hope to stay abreast with the latest 
and greatest information available " 

In 1977, Perez came to IPFW 
and has maintained a dental labora- 
tory practice ever since. Currently, 
he is owner/manager of Perez 
Dental Laboratory Clinic and 
Consulting Services. 

He frequently lectures to non- 
sludent groups, practicing denial 
technicians, dental study groups, 
dental laboratories, dental compa- 
nies and at dental conferences 
nationally and internal ion ally. 

Perez is an active member of 
numerous organizations. He is 
chairman of Ihe Fort Wayne 



Mayor's Affirmative Action 
Advisory Council, past president of 
Ihe Fort Wayne Hispanic Chamber 

of Commerce and board member for 
Indianapolis J. Everiti Light Career 
Cenier (a high school dental career 
center). Community Action of 




Northeast Indiana, and American 
Red Cross of Nonheasi Indiana. 

He is also a member of the 
Greater Indianapolis Study Group. 
The group meeis three limes within 
the fall semester and three times 
during the spring semester. It is 



similar to an educational workshop. 
The members often invite guest 
speakers within the dental field, 
while most of the lime is spent in 
group conversation. 

In addition, he is a member of 
the Commercial Denial Laboratories 
of Indiana, to whose board of direc- 
tors he was recently elected for a 
second term. 

"As long as I can remember, Al 
has contribuied to education all 
across the country, " said Lawrence 
L Sowinski, president of 
Commercial Denial Laboratories of 
Indiana and president of Somcr 
Dental Laboratories in Zionsville. 
"He trains technicians for certifica- 
tion and continuing education, he's 
heavily involved in consulting with 
laboratories and he's a very active 
member in our association." 

Perez's areas of expertise and 
class topics include anatomy, tooth 
morphology and physiology, occlu- 
sion, fixed prosthodonlics and den- 
tal laboratory management He is a 
Certified Denial Technician in the 
specialties of crown and bridge and 
ceramics. 

Perez earned his M.S.Ed, in 
1984. B.SJBd. in 1981. and a A.S. in 
1977, all from Indiana University. 



Lounge renovation procedures change

The issue of space is visible once 
again in Walb Memorial Union. 

In the past, the lounge areas were 
available for organizations to use on 
an overflow basis. Many times the 
rooms in Walb were nol big enough 
for large groups of people to meet. 
Therefore, meetings such as those 
concerning Journalism day, SOAR 
and Paramedics' seminars, would 
use the lounges to prevent over- 
crowding. 

This policy is now changed in 
response to problems thai occurred 
last spring regarding student com- 
plaints. An organization had been 
using the space and asked numerous 
studying students to leave ihe area 
The organization also refused to 
allow the students into their selected 
lounge area. The students began to 
complain. 

"We've had a number of com- 
plaints about students wanting to 
study there." said Frank Borelli, 
vice chancellor of student affairs. 



"Studenis are inclined to sludy 
and relax in the lounges," said Blix 
Fredrick, head of ihe student union 
operation. In the past, Frederick 
bandied the renovation of the 
lounges. 

A meeting was held on Friday. 
July 12, 1996, to discuss die lounge 
scheduling guidelines. Those pre- 
sent were: Borelli: Marian 
Zimmerman, dean of students; Kim 
Jacobs, director of student activities; 
George Gounaris, student body 
president; Mike Heii, student body 
comptroller; Chris Douse, student 
body vice president; and Blix 
Fredrick. Walb Memorial Union 
operations supervisor. 

The group agreed Ihe lounges 
within Walb are occasionally 
"essential" for the success of certain 
university programs, due to the pur- 
pose of the event and lack of other 
space. While most of the guidelines 
were kept the same, there were a 
few changes. 

These alterations include that a 
notice of scheduled use will be post- 
ed 24 hours in advance to notify stu- 



dents who may want to study quiei- 
ly during that lime. 

Secondly, lounges will nol be 
scheduled during the last three 
weeks of spring and fall semesters, 
when students are preparing for 
finals. 

"We met with the organizations 
and came (o a decision," said 
Borelli. "We needed to protect 
lounges from being overpacked."

GTfje Communicator 



Ihursrait, August 29. 1996 



Staff Editorial 



Students deserve 
majority of fees 



Every year students donate a 
portion of their money lo 
some clandestine little pan 
of the IPFW bill called •The 
Student Service Fee," We assume 
thai Ihe amount we are charged is 
for something which benefits all 
students or at least has Ihe possibil- 
ity of benefiting all students 

Unfortunately, ihe majority of 
this fee finds its way to ihe athletic 
department, The same athletic 
department which sponsors volley- 
ball games at The War Memorial 
Coliseum arid soccer spectaculars 
in the fall. These games improve 
public relations and give IPFW a 
chance lo become known on a 
national scale. (Don't laugh!) 
They also bring in a significant 
amount of money 

The athletic department 
receives 60 percent of the student 
service fee which works out to 
about S339.712.50. Every other 
student activity outside the athletic 
department receives the remaining 
40 percent— $226,475.00 This 
money is used lo fund the child 
care cenler, IPSGA. The 
Communicator. Purdue-Indiana 
Theater and many other student 
organizations around campus. 

These organisations are open 
lo everyone without regard to their 
physical stature There are certain 
requirements lo join these groups 



but no one is refused ihe opportu- 
nity to join. 

Athletics, on the other hand, is 
an exclusive cadre where only the 
best physical specimens are 
allowed lo participate This is Ihe 
way athletics should be. If the out 
of shape couch potatoes competed, 
people may watch, bul only for the 
humor or curiosity. Sort of like 
slowing down to see an accident 
They are the finest athletes around 
and deserve our support and 
respect. 

We believe in the importance 
of athletics in college but not to the 
detriment of all other students. 
This year, nearly all non-athletic 
student activities had their budgets 
cut. This is partly due lo the declin- 
ing enrollment rate but also due to 
(he massive disparity within ihe 
amounts alloiied lo each section. 

Couldn't the university, which 
is supposed to be dedicated to 
learning, change the 60/40 split 
between athletics and sludeni 
activities so an equal number of

Take advantage of opportunities college offers

To those of you who are new 
students here at IPFW, I bid 
you welcome to what is, ide- 
ally, a life-changing experience. To 
those of you who have been here 
awhile, whether on the five- or the 
fifteen-year plan, let me welcome 
you back. In honor of a new acade- 
mic year, and because I, like most of 
those who work here, want you lo 
succeed, I'd like to offer some 
advice from the perspective of a 
teacher and learner about succeed- 
ing at university life 

A wonderful writer named 
Nikki Giovanni offered good advice 
to minority students attending pre- 
dominantly white universities. I 
think hers is good advice for alt stu- 
dents, and I'm going to begin by 
sharing her first and probably most 
important piece of advice: "Go to 
class No matter who you feel No 
matter how you think ihe professor 
feels about you." I spent part of last 
year on a university committee that 
sought to identify the best predic- 
tors or warning signs for students 
likely to fail their first semester of 
college; poor attendance was at (he 
top of the list. 

If you're not ai class you can't 
develop a clear understanding of 
what your teacher thinks is impor- 
tant and wants from you. If you're 
not at class, you will not gain what- 
ever that teacher hopes for you to 
gain. If you're not at class, you'll 
feel alienated and detached when 




Research has 
identified siu- 
denl-to-stu- 
dent interac- 
tion as a key factor in student acad- 
emic success. 

Come to class. Most of us work 
hard to provide experiences and 
information we believe is important 
and will serve you well. Sometimes 
you may encounter a professor who 
will tell you that attendance is "not 
required"; please don't ever confuse 
that message with the meaning that 
attendance is not necessary. To suc- 
ceed in academic courses, in most 
cases, attendance is necessary 
whether or not your teacher is keep- 
ing track of or awarding points for 
your being there. 

My second piece of advice is 
harder; Come to class with an open 
mind Learning involves willing- 
ness to consider new perspectives 
and new possibilities; learning 
requires an open mind. Having an 
open mind docs not mean, necessar- 
ily, that you have to give up cher- 
ished truth- and values, but it does 
mean you have to be willing to 
accept that there arc other ways of 
looking at the world, and that these 
other ways might have value. Not 
all of your teachers will share your 
beliefs about how a classroom 
should operate, how teachers or stu- 
dents should behave, about politics, 
or about how you view ihe world. 

Some of us consider ourselves 
facilitators of classroom learning, 
some of us lecture, some use discus- 
sion as our means of sharing infor- 



mation. Some of us may seem 
democratic, some autocratic and 
some even chaotic in how we con- 
duct ourselves in the classroom. Try 
to be willing to look beyond your 
areas of disagreement with us. and 
even our obvious failings, to find 
what can be teamed from ihe point 
of view we offer you. Be willing to 
do this with other students, loo. 

You are an important part of the 
classroom environment and experi- 
ence. Come lo class ready to be an 
active pan of the learning process. 
The chemistry of each classroom is 
affected by every individual who is 
present (or absent from) the envi- 
ronment and ihe altitudes they dis- 
play. You can enhance the experi- 
ence of every other student in the 
classroom by willingly engaging in 
Ihe process and by approaching 
what happens in the classroom with 
hopeful expectations. 

Be willing lo offer your profes- 
sors constructive feedback about the 
course process, assignments, tests, 
texts, elc. Participate fully in what- 
ever mid-semester or end-of-semes- 
ter course evaluations are conduct- 
ed — they are your opportunity to 
have a direct impact on the reputa- 
tion and educational quality of this 
institution. It is possible to be both 
respectful and constructively criti- 
cal. Your teachers, being human, arc 
more likely to respond well to criti- 
cisms offered with respect. Some of 
the best ideas I've received about 
how to improve the quality of the 
courses 1 teach came from my stu- 
dents. Be willing to help teachers 
and future students to have better 
leaching and learning experiences 
than you have had. 

Another idea for you to consid- 
er as this new semester begins: 
Learning has a value much bigger 
and richer than just what will aid 
you in your career. 1 know thai your 
career choice is important and that 
you're concerned about the occupa- 
tional and economic security of 



your future, but please understand 
that there is more going on in ihe 
classroom than just career prepara- 
tion, and there is more to be gained 
from the classroom experience than 
a boost lo your GPA. The courses in 
my own university experience thai 
most fostered in me a love of leach- 
ing and learning included courses in 
the history of European witchcraft, 
existentialism and the history plays 
of Shakespeare. None of these have 
any direct bearing on what 1 teach. 

Years ago, a sludeni of mine 
who returned to school after many 
years out came to me at the end of 
the semester, before the final exam. 
He did not test well and had failed 
the midterm. He told me. "1 just 
want you to know that, even if I fail 
this course. I don't want you lo feel 
lhat you've failed me. What I've 
learned about communication here 
this semester has saved my mar- 
riage." Tony did fail the course, but 
he did not fail the learning experi- 
ence. 

Finally, while you're here, take 
at least one or two courses just 
because you want to, just because 
they sound interesting, just because 
they're about something that 
intrigues you. I had an engineering 
student a few years back who took a 
course in sign language, just 
because... Every time I see him. be 
reminds me how much he enjoyed 
that class and bow gtad he is thai he 
took il. Every time 1 see him, I think 
it's lime I took sign language, too. 

Welcome to Ibis university. 
This is my ninth year here, and I'm 
proud to be a pan of it. This is a 
good place: good people work and 
teach here. Good people come here 
lo learn. Welcome Invite your par- 
ents, grandparents and siblings to 
come here, too. We're never too old 
to love learning. I hope you will.

Letter to the Editor SUBTERRANEAN 



Souder's tobacco 
position endorses 
abortion 



To the cdilor 

Mark Souder claims thai he's 
pro-life. He waxes indignant about 
abortion, even those that occur to 
prevent serious injuries to women 
with pregnancy complications, as 
witnessed by his inflammatory 
denouncement of the Presidents 
veto of legislation to criminalize 
extremely rare late term abortions 

About 500 such abortions 
occur per year, and the circum- 
stances surrounding them are usual- 
ly tragic; women who wanted to 
bear children but found themselves 
faced with a choice between dying 
while giving birth or terminating 
their pregnancy in order to live; 
women who faced the prospect of 
life-long crippling injuries if they 
continued their pregnancies and 
women who discovered that their 
fetuses were so deformed that they 
could not survive outside the 
womb. 

While Souder would criminal- 
ize those women for their actions 
under circumstances that he will 
never have to face, Souder himself 
promotes unnecessary abortions. A 
study in the April 1995 Journal of 
Family Practice points out that cig- 
arette smoking causes between 
19.000 and 141,000 "spontaneous" 
abortions per year. The study's best 
estimate centers around 115,000 
smoking -induced abortions per 
year. 

Souder. who lakes large 
amounts of PAC money from "Big 
Tobacco" and opposes Food and 
Drug Administration efforts to reg- 
ulate tobacco and protect children 
from nicotine addiction, essentially 
supports thousands of tobacco- 
induced abortions. 

A small number of women who 
undergo an extremely rare abortion 
procedure in order to save their 
lives and health should be made 
criminals, in Souder's view A small 
number of tobacco executives who 
make millions by addicting mil- 
lions of young people to a known 
abortifaoeni. on the other hand, are 
great guys because their companies 
contribute to Souder's campaign. 
Under the latter set of circum- 
stances, thousands of unnecessary 
abortions per year clearly do not 
bother Souder because part of the 
money from that drug finances his 



campaign 

In addition lo the thousands of 
unborn that arc lerminaied by 
tobacco each year, Souder also 
endorses the injury of thousands of 
other fetuses and newborn children; 
the same study reports that smoking 
greatly increases risks of low birth 
weight and sudden infant death 
syndrome. And need I mention the 
post-bom who have perished from 
Souder's favorite drug?

Something old. something bor- 
rowed, something new... 

Beginning this Tall, (he Indiana 
University School of Continuing 
Studies and the 1UPUI School of 
Education will use distance learning 
technologies to make available 
courses leading to a Master of 
Science in Adult Education. 

'The masters degree teaches the 
most effective and up-to-daie prac- 
tices in adult education The pro- 
gram is based on sound theories and 
the latest research and learning con- 
cepts. It values the uniqueness of 
individual learners and views learn- 
ing as a lifelong process that can 
take place both with and without the 
formal classroom 



Within the program, students 
Icam technical, instructional and 
intellectual skills needed to be a suf- 
ficient leader They learn how to 
integrate experience and formal 
educational or training activities 
inio overall lifelong learning pro- 
grams to achieve personal and orga- 
nizational skills. 

This degree is recommended for 
students involved in business, gov- 
ernment, nursing, airline piloting 
and individuals in many other occu- 
pations Many students join the pro- 
gram to begin a new career. Others 
try to enhance their current one. 

Students on the IPFW campus 
may wonder what all this excite- 
ment has to do with them. Well, it is 
coming to the campus. 

Courses leading to the degree 
are now available via distance learn- 



ing on the following campuses: IU 
East (Richmond). IPFW. IU 
Bloomington and IUPUI This is the 
first such program to be offered via 
distance learning by a major univer- 
sity. 

The course will be unique in 
that it is partially instructed by a sys- 
tem called Virtual Indiana 
Classroom (VIC). The system, set 
up in room B35 of the Helmke 
Library, will link together the four 
campuses so that they can learn with 
and from each other. Through the 
new television technology, students 
on the Fort Wayne campus will be 
fortunate enough to receive a unique 
broader range of knowledge. Half of 
the class will take place within B35. 
while the remainder will consist of 
site visits.

New science building makes 
progress with some hurdles 



by Jeremy Ecenbarger 
News Editor 

Along with everything and 
everyone changing at IPFW, a sci- 
ence building is currently under 
construction on the south side of 
campus. 

With a plan to be completed by 
April of 199K, the new building will 
introduce a fresh area to all science 
majors, including: biology, chem- 
istry and the geo sciences. 

The floor plan includes wet labs. 
cold rooms, a large computer lab. 
several general classrooms and a 
targe lecture hall with the capacity 
of 1 20 people. 

Money for the building was 
given through bonds authorized by 
[he Indiana Legislaiure. However, 
campus administrators will soon be 



asking for another 6.6 million in 
order for completion. 

"The assembly has always been 
very supportive," said Vice 
Chancellor of Financial Affairs 
Walter Branson. "I am sure we will 
gel il." 

As a result of Ihc current con- 
struction, available parking has 
drastically decreased. Many times a 
student must park on the opposite 
side or the campus in order to reach 
a building by the south parking lot 
where construction is now taking 
place. 

"Students may need to come a 
little earlier, or may just need to 
park in the north area," said 
Lieutenant Thomas Haner of the 
campus police. 

Next fall, contractors will begin 
their work on a new parking garage 



that will be located on the south side 
of campus. Contractors may be 
moving the tennis courts lo enable 
the garage lo be located in a central 
position according to Branson. The 
garage should also be finished by 
April of 1998. 

"Parking is going to be a prob- 
lem until the garage is completed, 
but there eventually will be room," 
said Branson, 

Afier the science building and 
parking garage are completed, the 
older classrooms within Keltler will 
be remodeled and used for other 
departmenis that lack needed space. 

Furthermore. Branson says that 
the north side will be the sight of 
future changes. But no new projects 
have been announced. 



going to be small," said Dr. Carol 
Aikman. from the School of 
Education. "But Richmond has six- 
teen people, plus a waiting list." 

There will be one class offered 
now. However, there will be two 
available in the spring. 

This fall. Professor Travis Shipp 
will teach Education D.S12: Forms 
and Forces of Adult Education. The 
course focuses on the history and 
current status of adult education 
The elements included are nature, 
scope, purpose and historical devel- 
opment of adult education institu- 
tions and programs. 

The class is presently scheduled 
for Tuesdays from 5:45 p.m. to 8:10 
p.m. 

The spring of 1997 course will 
be Education D521: Participation

could quit "cold turkey." or use "the 
patch." Quitting "cold turkey" 
would be far too difficult for all of 
those involved. I knew I would 
become simply evil without nico- 
tine in my system. I knew 
'the patch" was my way 
ut. I would gradually 
be weaned off of the 
drug and maintain my 
civility. Ah. if it were 
only that simple. 

Of course I had 

some fears of quilting: 

weight gain, weight 

n and weigh! gain I 

aJso began to visualize 

myself as a non-smoker, in which 

case my curiosity got the best of me. 

For instance, what did non-smokers 

do when they drank coffee? or when 



they were driving? or reading? or 
just talking on the phone? How was 
I to make it through my all-niters 
without a cigarcuc? I had to put 
these thoughts out of my mind 
quickly because I was psyching 
myself out. 

So I smoked my last cigarette as 
if it were not the last (for fear of 
placing too much emphasis on the 
whole damn thing). In any event, I 
was expecting quilting lo be much 
like I had heard it was like. For 
example. "The firsi two weeks are 
the worst." WRONG! Coming from 
someone who never missed one day 
of smoking in seven years — trust 
me — the first day is the worst. 

It was quite traumatic. I was an 
addict and that's all there was to it. 
At least 1 was getting my nicotine

expect. To 
my surprise, 
it really was 
not loo bad. 

$ Ecenbarger The special 

effects were 

outstanding, 
but much of 
the support- 
ing cast 
acted poor- 
ly. Yet, the 
appearance 
of horror - 
maven Dee Wallace Stone ("The 
Hills Have Eyes," "Cujo") added 
some special light to the film. 
Suspense, laughter, a touch of 
romance and the advanced 
effects kepi this film only slight- 
ly above the waier. 



This summer brought 
movies of every genre to the 
public eye. There were films that 
were hysterica), emotional, often 
extremely original and definitely 
entertaining. Many films con- 
sisted of breakthrough special 4. A remake of "The Nutty 
effects that proved to be a strong Professor" brought back the 



money-making factor. Several 
movies caught cinemas on fire, 
various ones made them only 
sizzle, while the rest never quite 
made it out of the freezer. 

This was the summer thai 
brought out the stars. Big movies 
like "A Tune to Kill" gave little 
names like Matthew 

McConaughey a terrific intro- 
duction, while movies like 
"Mission: Impossible," "Eraser" 
and "The Rock" proved siars 
like Tom Cruise, Arnold 
Schwarzenegger and Sean 
Connery still walked on solid 
ground. Other films worth men- 
tioning are: Jim Carrey's "The 
Cable Guy." Meg Ryan's 
"Courage Under Fire." Demi 
Moore's "Striptease." Michael 
Keaton's "Multiplicity" and 
Keanu Reeve's "Chain 
Reaction," The characters por- 
trayed were, beyond-a-doubl, ; 



smiling face of Eddie Murphy. 
He portrayed an array of charac- 
ters that filled Ihe cinema with 
laughter. The story revolves 
around Murphy's central charac- 
ter, a science professor who 
deals with the trials of obesity. 
When he drinks an amazing sci- 
entific potion, he goes from a 
large man to a svelte man who's 
the subject of every woman's 
desires. The scenes that stole the 
show were the ones in which 
Murphy played most of his fam- 
ily silling ai a dinner table. The 
grandmother's talk of "rela- 
tions" had me rolling in my seat. 
The only problem that I found 
with ihe film was that it got pret- 
ty boring towards the end. Much 
like the films of Jim Carrey, the 
last joke is often a repeat of the 
first

wide variety, yei each one staled &lt;"Mad about you") teamed up 



their purpose 

However, as summer catch- 
es up with us, the average person 
does not have lime to waich 
everything that comes lo the 
screen. Yet. I managed to catch a 
glimpse of quite a few 

Dunng the summer hiatus, 
five movies stand out in my 
mind. I will rale ihcm according 
to my persona] enjoyment. 

5. Michael J Fox relumed to the 

screen in "The Frightners," por- 
traying a con-man psychic who 
sees ghosts after his wife dies. 
With reading bad reviews else- 
where, 1 was not sure what to 



with Bill Paxlon ("Apollo 13") 
(o star in the roller coaster ride 
"Twister." This movie held its 
ground ai the box office, earning 
millions upon millions of dol- 
lars. The slory revolved around a 
group of tornado chasers who 
longed to find out whal "ihe 
storms of disaster" were made 
of. With each lomado, they 
plunged head first. The acting 
was top notch and most of Ihe 
side effects looked believable. 
Adventure, mixed with humor, 
make this movie a crowd pleas- 
cr. However, what was not 
believable was that not one 
member of lheir learn was killed, 



or even scratched for that matter. 
2. Now I never really liked the 
man, but lohn Travolta gave a 
really moving performance in 
"Phenomenon." It was a greal 
feel good film. It is a story about 
a man. played by Travolta, who 
is hit by a mysterious, shiny light 
one night that drastically 
changes his capability to learn. 
With Ihe sudden gift, he longs lo 
solve the basic problems of the 
world without even ihinking 
about giving himself credit. All 
he wants is lo make people 
happy, especially his Diana Ross 
obsessed best friend, played by 
Forrest Whitaker, and his beauti- 
ful love interest, played terrifi- 
cally by Kyra Sedgwick. It is a 
move that makes you laugh and 
basically makes you fall down in 
tears ~ make sure you bring a 
tissue. Yet, it is one thai will fill 
the viewer with much inspira- 
tion. 

1. Finally, a movie that rose 
high above the rest 
was "Independence Day" or 
"ID4." This was jusi a wonder- 
ful movie; one could not ask for 
much more, It had humor, 
action, drama and "out of this 
world" effects. The story is 
about an aitack on the world 
from beings of another planet. 
With an ensemble cast, they 
brought forth a movie that start- 
ed with a bang that put a never 
ending impression on the audi- 
ence. Will Smiih's portrayal as 
an American Air Force pilot 
brought a distinct comedtc style 
io the film, yet his seriousness 
was ofien evident Bill Paxion's 
role as the United Slates presi- 
dent was a memorable every- 
thing: his speeches brought the 
audience to a deafening silence. 
It was jusi a film thai had every- 
thing, and it just blew my mind. 
However, its theme was Ihe most 
important thing, It revealed 
how much people need to set 
aside their "petty" differences 
and join logclher. It made you 
wonder why we fight over such 
small, unimporianl things when 
we could be much stronger join- 
ing together. 

None of the movies I saw 
were horrible - 1 mean, mere 
weren't any "Ishiars" or 
"Howard the Ducks" - yet it is 
the little things that make one 
beiier than the other. 



with the patch. 1 knew it would be 
okay. However, the actual physical 
addiction of smoking is just as bad 
as the chemical addiction. I was 
rather surprised that I got over the 
jitteriness of not knowing what lo do 
with my hands. This may be 
because I found something else lo 
do with them. My hands were busy 
unwrapping all the candy 1 suddenly 
became fond of Yes. it's true, my 
fear became a reality and 1 gained 
ten pounds quickly 

Even though I had the paich, il is 
very difficult to qui! smoking. I 
stayed away from all of my friends 
ihai smoked for a couple of weeks. 
bought some spiritual books, and 
relied on my support group during 
times of weakness. I gradually 
exposed myself lo inslances where I 



knew there would be a temptation to 
smoke. And yes it was difficult! But 
I did not smoke. 1 actually enjoyed sniff- 
ing the smoke of others, however, 1 
did not realize how awful smokers 
smell. I beg your forgiveness for the 
horrible scent I've carried with me 
all of these years. 1 was unaware of 
the foul stench I have been imposing 
on others. 

In any event, my new non-smok- 
ing status does not dimmish my 
belief in smokers' rights. Just don' I 
blow your smoke my way. It is true 
trial your senses get stronger. For 
instance, I can pick up on someone 
smoking a cigarette in the third red 
car on the left in front of me when 
I'm driving on the highway. 

To be honest, weight gain and all 
— it's worth il. The only hard pan 



is that you can't smoke — EVER!!! 
I will always miss it. It's nice to be 
able to actually smell like my per- 
fume though. It's nice nol having to 
ration my cigarettes. My concentra- 
tion has also improved because now 
I'm not consianily thinking it's lime 
for a cigarette, so the good out- 
weighs the bad in this case. Besides 
the best incentive — getting healthy 
— I'm saving over SI. 000 a year, 

Smoke-free for over two months. 
I have finally become comfortable 
enough with my non-smoking staius 
lo start laking the few extra pounds 
off And as for my curiosity in 
regard to what non-smokers do 
when they drink coffee, drive, read, 
or talk on Ihe phone — they simply 
drink coffee, drive, read and talk on 
the phone.

20 TIPS FOR NEW STUDENTS 



by PaulTupper 
Editor 

College really is different from 
bigb school, although n may not 
seem like it ai first Whether you are 
a young freshman or a returning 
adult braving a new territory, we 
offer these tips to help you inhabit 
: this new world called academia. 

1. When buying your books, 
always have the course number and 
professor/ins trucior. if known. The 
same class taught by different teach- 
ers could require different books 

2. When registering for classes, 
investigate your options in the 
"IPFW Bulletin" (and elsewhere) 
and make your choices before you 
meet with you adviser. The 
"Bulletin" can tell you exactly what 
your options are and you can take 
your lime in deciding whai you'd 
like lo take. 

3. When you go to leave campus, 
leave out the nearesi exit. This will 
avoid long lines at any given exit. 

■4- Don'l arrive unexpectedly at 
your adviser's office and expect lo 
receive a smiling face. Unless you 
go during posted ofTicc hours, make 
an appointment and try to limit your 
discussion to 15 minutes Take 
longer if necessary, bul be aware of 
what is important to discuss. 

5- Keep your syllabi and refer to 
them often If an instructor bas pre- 
pared a good syllabus, it will be a 
good guide for the entire semester 

6. Always arrive to class at least 
five minutes early and sil in the 
front Even on days when your 
■ attention span is limited, you will 
'certainly remember more by sitting 
closer to the front. 

7- Each credit hour should be 
accompanied by three bours of 
study Taking 12 hours? Be prepared 
to study 36 hours per week to suc- 
ceed. College can be completed by 
studying less, bul why risk ii? 

6. Don't pay a company to find a 
scholarship for you Go to the 

library. The same information is 
there for free and many scholarships 



go unawarded due to lack of appli- 
cations. In many cases, the scholar- 
ships aren't awarded based on 
grades, so don'l Ihink you can't gel 



J. When you go to the library, don't 
get frastraied - gel help. The staff is 
ready and willing to assist you. And 
take your assignment. If you aren't 
sure aboul the exact details of the 
assignment, the library staff can 
help steer you in the right direction 

10. Start important assignments 
immediately Don't wait until (he 
lasl minute. Some materials can be 
retrieved from other libraries for the 
asking (thai means free). The sooner 
you finish, the more time you have 
lo concentrate on other things 

11. Use a calendar and suck to il. 
Know what your day holds before 
you try lo live it. 

12. Three words: organize, orga- 
nize, organize. This ranges from 
time management lo note taking to 
backpack packing. Taking the extra 
lime will save you time. 

1J. Don'l be afraid to make friend- 
ships with your professors. They are 
people too. and some of them are 
even hip enough lo like. 
Understanding them personally can 
help you understand them academi- 
cally, and vice versa. But be cau-

ferently, it's a good idea (o use mul- 
tiple note-partners lo ensure getting

if you are going to survive college. 
A proper diet and light exercising 
will give you thai vital energy.

ly if you are a working student or 
parent. College will provide you 
with rewards beyond your wildest 
dreams, but you must sacrifice a lot 
today for a belter tomorrow. 

20. Take lime away. Learn (0 say

will do more damage than taking a 
short break Go do siuff wiih 
friends. See a movie Escape acade- 
mia for short periods of time before 
it kicks you out.

Vid&amp;o (Review: 
Annie Lennox Live 



by Paul Tupp*r 

Annie Lennox is a goddess 
"Diva." We all know this. But she 
had been absenl from the concert 
stage in America for sin years when 
she performed one show 
in Central Park lasi 
September, The show is 
now available on video 
cassette, quenching the 
thirst of many who 
would like to sec her 



live. 

"Annie Lennox Live 
in Central Park" is proof 
she was the talented 
member of Eurythmics. 
Not only does she sing 
with authority, she com- 
mands the stage like 
"Medusa." Performing songs from 



pays mast attention to songs from 
"Diva," and rightfully so. "Diva" 
was her first solo album and the 
only one in which she wrote, or co- 
wrote, most of the material. 

She does perform some 
Eurythmics numbers, but not with- 
out putting her own 
spin on things 
"Who's that girl?" has 
a new acoustic begin- 
ning and "You have 
placed a chill on my 
heart" is extended (o 
give Lennox room to 
play. The only mis- 
s t c p in her 
Eurythmics selections 
is "Sweet dreams (are 
made of this)," which 
is performed by 
Lennox and her band 
with too much ease, staying too 




every aspect of her career, Lennox close to its original form 1 got the 



sense I had heard this before 

Also gelling the acoustic treat- 
ment is "Waiting in vain," her cover 
of Bob Marley's tune from 
"Medusa." All you hear is a single 
guitar and Lennox's voice. It is def- 
initely a standout performance. 

The video also contains the four 
videos from "Medusa" and 
view with Lennox on where she 
comes up with the elements to make 
each video. Since "Waiting in vain" 
and "Something so right" were not 
played on American video channels, 
their inclusion is a rare treat. 

"Annie Lennox Live in Central 
Park" will certainly hold true 
Lennox fans for a while until her 
next release. But, as Rolling Stone 
magazine is quoted on the back of 
the video box, "Maybe now she will 
(perform live) more often." 

If only Annie Lennox would 
agree.

Hotline answers questions; 
offers advice on rape 



by Cassie Kitter 
Features Editor 

Rape is something we never 
expect to happen to us. And why 

would we? One reason we should is 
because the FBI estimates that one 
in every three women and one in 
every ten men will be raped in their 
lifetime. If it happened to you - 
what would you do? 

The Fort Wayne Women's Bureau 
offers free information in regard to 
rape and other sexual assaults. The 
Women's Bureau also has a rape 
hotline number for those in need of 
advice. The 24-hour hodine number 
is 426-7273 (in Fort Wayne), cr 1- 
800-656-HOPE. 



So what can we do to see that it 
doesn't happen to us? Prevent what 
you can. Be aware of your sur- 
roundings at all times. Make a con- 
scious decision beforehand of what 
you will do if ever approached in 
such a way. Be an informed citizen 
and protect yourself the best you 
can. However, sometimes not even 
this is enough. 

Some of the information 
includes: what to do if you arc 
raped, how you may feel if you are 
raped, recovering from rape and 
safety tips. 

Safety tips include what to do on 
a date, what to be aware of. and 
facts about acquaintance rape. 
More infoimaiion in regard to facts 



and myths about rape, what to do if 
a friend is raped, and profiles of 
rapists is included. 

According to the Women's 
Bureau, rapists rape to feel powerful 
and to humiliate. They do not rape 
for sex. Rapists can be anyone and 
anyone can be raped. And remem- 
ber, if you are ever the victim of

NBA trades laughs; gaffs draw fire 




Brant 
jjKelley 






by S. Brant Kellcy 
Sports Editor 

With players flowing 
.ih. .hi like they're going 
out of prime and dollars 
flying about like they're going out of 
style, it would behoove a few NBA 
general managers to step back from 
the flying circus and investigate 
which players are stealing from the 
fans and which players are simply a 
steal. 

These teams were robbed relative- 
ly blind during the off-season scur- 
rying last summer 

Dallas - Why buy back 3n expen- 
sive point guard when you already 
have one? The sad thing here is 
Derek Harper, an otherwise talented 
and proven point guard who will 
likely play behind Jason Kidd. is 
also a big loser. 

Detroit - Why buy back an expen- 
sive power forward (Rick Mahorn) 
when you already have one (Otis 
Thorpe)? (Is there a pattern here?) 
To bolster their backcourt, Michael 
Curry was not the Pisions' answer, 
and they have yet to truly replace 



Bill Laimbecr; 
by ihe way. 
who is Don 
Ricd? 

Denver - 
Now that the 
Nuggets have 
added a tem- 
peramental 
(and aged) 
shooter as well 
as a very aver- 
age off guard 
and center, they 
have assured 
their place among, oh. about fourth 
place in the Midwestern division. 

Miami - Paying Alonzo SIOO mil- 
lion lit the fire, so losing Juwon 
Howard (a Tine player in his own 
right) doused it with rocket fuel. 
Admittedly, part of the Heat's prob- 
lems were beyond its control and 
Tim Hardaway can be a long-term 
backcourt leader, but only two good 
players makes only one average ball 
club, and in a hurry. 

Philadelphia • I thought I was in 
the news business here, but I am also 
sworn to report the facts. I can't say 
anything here which hasn't already 
been said, except, HEY, Charles. 
wanna come back!? 

Truly there is no respect among 
thieves, just a realization that some 
are better at it than others. These 
clubs played the shyster this pasi off 
season: 

Atlanta - which got a terrific boon 
late last year with the addition of 
Christian Leattner and then the firsl- 
round upset of the Indiana Pacers. 
Dikembe Mutombo is a big man 
which can be a team foundation 



Steve Smith is an athletic and gified 
scorer as well as a versatile position 
player, Leaper Jon Barry will add 
significant depth at both wing spots. 
Indiana - but only if everyone 
stays healthy; if so, the Pacers may 
put together a 55-win season this 
year. Returning the Davises brings a 
whole complimeni which is greater 
than the sum of its pans. The loss of 
Mark Jackson will hurt, but the loss 
of his salary will help and Indiana 
may have immediate help in Fred 
Hoiberg, a young guard who last 
year in the playoffs displayed a mea- 
sure of poise usually reserved for 



courtmatcs several years his senior. 

Orlando - Losing Shaquille 
O'Neal made their learn betier with a 
snap of the fingers. Shaq is a force 
inside, bui the Magic need a big guy 
who can hit free throws, is not 
dependent upon the size- favorable 
officiating prevalent in the Eastern 
Conference and doesn't disappear 
(pun intended) in the waning 
moments of a crucial game. 
Anfcrnee Hardaway is the rock upon 
which Brian Hill should build his 
following. Now if they can only get 
rid of Nick Anderson ... 

Golden State - Gelling Mark Price 



and keeping Latrcll Sprewell make have made this category i 
for a solid backcourt. The Warriors the previous six years. 
still have a lot of holes to Till. though, 
mainly because they would never

After contending for the Great

The Volleydons, lop-three con- ditional three With only three 

ferencc finishers in each of the pre- berths available, the only teams

invited were members of the domi- 
nant Great Lakes Intercollegiate 
Athletic Conference This year, with 
four berths, somebody else should 
get a shot. 

The Volleydons' traditional chal- 
lenger in the GLVC, Northern 
Kentucky University, is not antici- 
pated to be a threat this year. The 
Norse lost the entire front line from 
their GLVC championship team a 
year ago to graduation According 
to Heffron, the big question mark is 



the University of Missouri -St. 
Louis. 

"I have never seen them play." he 
said. 

Despite its 30-2 record. NKU did 
not receive a bid last year. Heffron 
said that IPFW would not have 
received a tournament berth either 
because of a number of early-season 
losses lo teams in the GL1AC 
Knowledge of that may have con- 
tributed to the learns down mood 
going into the conference tourna- 



ment, he said. 

"(Not going to the regional tour- 
nament) was decided before the 
conference tournament," he said 

The Volleydons begin their sea- 
son tomorrow night at the North 
Dakota State Classics in Fargo 
against NDSU Other tournament 
participants include the university 
of Minnesota-Duluth, Winona St
