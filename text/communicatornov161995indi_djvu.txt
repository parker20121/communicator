IPSGA calls for change 
in Walb Student Union 



Students' government 
pushes to make Walb 
more student-oriented 



by MclbsB Young-F1or«9 
News Editor 



A week ago Monday. 
George Gounaris. 
IPSGA senator, 

declared the need for 
change in the controlling depart- 
ment of Walb Union. The 
announcement was sparked by a 
recent incident in which studying 
students were asked to leave the 
upstairs lounge during the National 
Dcp^ssion Screening 

Blix Fredrick, operations super- 
visor, said the area wa.s reserved by 
an IPFW depanmenl for ihe stu- 
dents and is only used when all 
other facilities on campus are 
taken. 

"It has never been a big deal," 
said Fredrick. "I think someone has 
chosen to make it a big deal." 



Fredrick said, however, she 
understands ihe students' posiuon 
and said the reservation of the 
space is often denied because other 
places arc available. 

"The lounge shouldn't be a 
space where students should be 
kicked out of." Gounaris said. 
"This is a students' union." 

Gounaris said he docs not 
believe the problem is fundamental 
"The problem is the administration 
has lusE touch with [he fact thai this 
is a students' union and therefore 
bas reserved il for various other 
activities." said Gounaris. 

IPSGA president Kevin Eads 
said currently the senate is jusl dis- 
cussing possible solutions for the 
problem but is expected to make a 
move soon Gounaris and IPSGA 
Vice President Terri Grimm, how- 
ever, have suggestions and are 
working to implement them. 



"The Students' Activities 
Director should control Walb 
because the position is directly 
related to more students than con- 
tinuing education is'," said 
Gounaris. 

Grimm is working not only to 
increase 
some 
students' 
ngbts on 
campus, 
but also 
to help 
spruce 



up the 
union. 



are a lot 

of things 



done, 
but we 
don't 
expect it 
to hap- 
p e n 
within 



year. 



"There are a 
lot of things 

we want done, 
but we don't 
expect them 
to happen in 

the next year," 
— Grimm 



Grinun 

Gnmm said the studenu' gov- 
ernment is working to move ccmtin- 
uing education from the union and 



to move FoUetl's from Keltler into 
the union. In addition, IPSGA is 
considering bringing some fast- 
food restaurants inio the union 
when the university's contract with 
Canteen Corporation has expired, 
relocating disabled services com- 
pletely to down- 
stairs Walb 
Union, and cre- 
ating a student's 
rotating art 
exhibit. 

Grimm 
said she would 
like to see the 
student identifi- 
cation cards be 
upgraded to also 
serve as a debit 
card that could 
be used to make 
purchases 
around campus. 

Grimm 
plans to contact 
John Walda. an 
lU trustee and 
liaison between 
Ihe lU Board of 
Trustees and 
IPFW. to see what changes may be 
made over the next semester 

"It is looking to be a busy spring 
semester," said t3nmm.

Federal government shuts down 



Congress, President 
run out of time 
to agree on budget 



by Melissa Young-Florcs 
News Editor 

Monday the president vetoed the tem- 
porary borrowing bill. The gridlock 
between the Republican Congress and 
Democratic president continued inio 
Tuesday foremg the federal govemmeni 
to shut down. 

Only ibose agencies considered to be 
protecting life, security of propeny. or 



other major essential positions were 
allowed to open their doors, leaving 
approximately 800,000 civilian federal 
workers at home. 

For ihe first time in five years, no 
garbage was picked up in Washington 
DC, The IRS did not collect any money 
and no passports were processed. In 
kecpmg with tradition, those wbo were 
furloughcd during the shutdown will be 
compensated for the time off 

"We are an agency that deals with 
safety of life," said David Slosson, act- 
ing air traffic manager at Fort Wayne 
International Airport. "All of those 
agencies that deal with safety of life and 
security of property are exempted from 
furlough." 

Slosson said, even though the field 
office is open, the clerical and adminis- 
trative offices are closed, and the 



employees may not receive their pay- 
checks on lime 

Sixty percent of federal positions 
were considered vital. The Social 
Security and Welfare offices will be 
open and checks will be distributed to 
recipients, but no new claims will be 
filed. The post office is open with all 
services only because it is self-suffi- 
cient, and passpon applications will be 
accepted but none will be processed 
until the government is up and running 

On campus, business is running as 
usual, according to Vice Chancellor of 
Financial Affairs Walt Branson. He said 
very little of university funding comes 
torn the federal govemmeni. 

"There is nothing funding-wise that 
would affect the university." said 
Branson. 

Although the university itself will 



have no problems functioning, those 
wbo may still be waiung for federal 
loans or grants will not receive checks 
during the furlough, said Branson. 

Noi all federd offices in Fort Wayne 
had been told whether to open or stay 
closed "We are pan of the Department 
of Agriculture. It is our understanding 
our pan of the budget was passed a cou- 
ple of weeks ago," said David Lamm, 
district conservationist for Natural 
Resources Conservation Services in Fort 
Wayne, 

Slosson. who bas 18 years of experi- 
ence working with the federal govern- 
ment, said he Iwiieves the layoff will 
end soon. "I do not expeci thb to last 
long, based on past experience," said 
Slosson. "Nobody wants to be in this 
status, including legislators."

C.P.--C.I.C.--in 2000 A.D.? 



When Colin Powell announced 
be would not be running Tor 
Presidcnl. Ihe Republican offices 
probably rc^cmbtcd Uic Simpson 
family after ibc O J. acqumal If 
Powell had decided to run. Ihe 
Republican's chances of gaining 
control of the White House would 
have decreased wcmcndously 

The reiired general said his 
decision was based on two factors; 
Ibe media scntuny that was sure to 
follow a decision to run, and a lack 
of calling to be the president 

TTie former is a very wise con- 
sidcraiion. When you decide to run 
for office, especially the presiden- 
cy, the media delves into a past that 
may or may not be yours Just 
imagine the look on Mrs. Powell's 
face if a media source had 
announced an affair Colin had had 
with Gcnnifcr Flowers, TTie dissec- 
tion from the media is not fair, nor 
is it controllable. 

The laiier is a weak excuse If 
Colin Powell could not hear a call- 
ing,, he simply was not listening 
American voters want a change and 
often said via opinion polls thai he 



bad the momentum to make that 
change. The pubhc spoke loud and 
clear. Docs he need an invitation in 
writing to run? 

If the public plea was not 
enough, the increase in racial ten- 
sions should have been A black 
figure in a high office could only 
help matters Powell himself said 
he would be a savior in the race- 
relations fight. Do saviors have the 
right to decide when to help in a 
cause? 

You may remember that the 
po.uibiliiy of Colin Powell's presi- 
dency was a creation of the media. 
Immediately following out win m 
the Gulf, puhlicauons and TV news 
.shows began the talk of a possible 
presidential win. 

If Powell would run. and 
remember that it Ls still not out of 
the question (see Ross Peroi), there 
would be a serious fight between 
him and Bob Dole, ensuring a 
Democratic win. Plus, Powell has 
hinted a possible run in 2000. 

Maybe we should all vote for 
Lyndon Larouche.

Commentary 



A man, a woman, a 
crush, a gay, a big mess 



Is there life out there? 

// so, show me 




else, but that the person is the same 
sex as you. 

Just as when someone is said to 
be dating a person of the opposite 
sex, the hunter tries to sway the 
prey to bis or her side. The differ- 
eitce being this: straights stalking a 
gay not only have to convince them 
to leave the person because be or 
she is better than 
the current love, 
but that this gay 
episode is tempo- 
rary. Too often, 
whwi a gay person 
is being persued 
by a straight per- 
son, be they male 
or female, the 
straight person 
tries hard to ignore 
the gay factor 

The problem escalates in a work 
setting. Romantic relationships at 
work IS a tricky but unavoidable 
issue. When you spend forty-plus 
hours with someone, it is hard not 
to let yourself get drawn into a dat- 
iDg situation. For many, work life 
and the people as.sociated with it is 
the only world they know. 

When a crush develops on a gay 
person by a soraight, the gay person 
has just a few options: avoid, lie or 
reveal. 

On many occasions the gay per- 
son must learn to avoid those who 




want to spend extracurricular time 
with him or her This is ofteii inter- 
preted to be a discarding of sorts to 
the per.son seeking love. The sub- 
ject of affection never really means 
10 harm, but often does. 

On other occasions the gay per- 
son must lie to protect bis or her 
sexuality or even his or her job. A 
lesbian might suddenly talk about a 
new man in her life or a gay man 
might talk about his fiancee Jan 
iostead of Jobn. This creates a sense 
of entrapment. The gay person can 
never talk about what really hap- 
pened over the weekend or seek 
advice about a normal spousal dis- 
pute because the staff will make 
undue judgments on them, maybe 
even to the point of shunning their 
co-worker 

Sometimes ihe gay person must 
reveal his or her lifestyle in order to 
communicate at work This may not 
always be good. If 
the gay person is an 
authority figure at 
work and the 
admirer is one of 
his or her staff. 
revLtiling a lifestyle

Creative interests concerning this 
campus have influenced me to write 
about the status of IPFW To the 
naked eye, this university is just auoth- 
er hybrid of the uneventful, happy-go- 
lucky colleges seen on T.V. or in 
movies. Look a little closer. Hang 
around campus for a while and sud- 
denly you realize that IPFW doesn't 
have a pulse. You can either ask your- 
selves why, or you can take the easier, 
more lethargic route and totally ignore 
the fact that IPFW is a lifeless void, 
unable to meet the criteria of college 
life which most colleges over-achieve, 

I roam from class to class each day. 
and the only things I hear from other 
students include sarcastic remarks 
about IPFW and mini-soliloquies 
about ways to get out of this town. 
Well, let's face the clown kids, Fon 
Wayne is a city compri.sed of factories 
and com fields The only amusement 
is bar-hopping every other night, lis- 
tening to mediocre bands, and even 
this gets monotonous from time to 
time Actually no, its 
boring most of the 
lime! The people I 
know are planning to 
either move out of state 
or to Indianapolis, 
where they travel every 
weekend anyway to get 
their kicks. 

My proposal, more 
so, my antidote for this 
sad excuse for a cam- 
pus is to establish an 
activities committee, or 
better yet, gel the

According to USA Today, ihe 
industry whicb will hurl the most is 
tourism — "hardly a boom industry 
in mid-November " (Damn iherc 
goes my Thanksgiving trip to 
AlcatTHz) 

One service shutdown which 
should cheer up fascist Buchanan 
supporters— NO NEW FOOD 
STAMPS WILL BE ISSUED. 
Money will nol be issued to 
women, infants and children. (Docs 
ihLs mean men will still be able to

fascists will applaud is the shut- 
down of all environmental regula- 
tion and enforcement programs 1 
may be mcorreci. but the environ- 
mem seems extremely essential lo 
our lives and well being But scn- 



ously. Congress and Ihe President 
must value inconsequential politics 
more than clean air. clean soil and 
clean nvers. After all it's only oxy- 
gen, din and water. (I've beard 
breathing is overrated anyway) 

I think II is amusing that the Post 
Office will still be running on tune 
I know thai sounded like an oxy- 
moron, hui what the hell 

On the other side of the political 
fence, maybe the shutdown is a 
While House ploy to delay benefit 
checks to veterans Think about it. 
Clinton is an accused commie- 
pinko traitor wiih 30 year-old ties lo 
ihe former Soviet Union And 
another thing to think about — only 
iwo countries in the weslem hemi- 
sphere have Communist Parlies; 
Cuba and the US 

In reality the only effect the 
shutdown will have upon the major- 
ity of us will be an escalation of the 
dissatisfaction with Washmgton and 
politicians. Our country sent a defi- 
nite message in 1994 — No more 
business as usual and that is what 
we were promised by our 
Republican rcpreseniaiivcs. Bui 
they are playing the same games the 
E&gt;emoct^is did for 40 years. 

We were promised a new style 
of government from Lord Newt, 
instead we were handed the same 
gift in a new package. They are 
holding Clinlon hostage the same 
way the Democrats forced George 
Bush to sign the biggest lax

ihosc rights IS to secede But instead 
of seceding from the union let's 
banish Washington from the union 
and make our nation's capital in 
Oiiumwa, Iowa All Washington 
congress "people" and their staffs 
are grounded to the District of 
Columbia They cannot leave under 
any circumstance until they get a 
real job and flush their law degrees 
down the enormous toilet we will 
erect ouiside DC. (The irony is 
killing me) Citizens of DC, are 
allowed to leave and see how life is 
on the other side of (he septic tank. 

Laws would be made in this 
way: lawyers may decide how to 
regulate the medical insurance 
industry only if doctors [tfeside over 
tort reform Presidents will no 
longer serve two four-year terms 
They will now serve one six-year 
term with no chance of reelection. 
No posturing for a second term will 
be needed All congressmen will 
serve a total of eight years Same 
system-new rules. All staffs will be 
limited (o 10 people. Lawyers 
would be discouraged (o run for 
office by penalizing the loser with

Maybe this soluLon is a bit dras- 
tic but until somebody comes up 
with a belter answer, we should 
seriously consider this course of 
action.

Excessive drinking 
can cause poisoning 



by Suz«nnr Weldon 
Gucsl WriUr 

When was Ibc lasi time you went 
(o a parly and could actually 
remember how many drinks you 
consumed by ibe time ttie night was 
over? How many times this past 
year did you sit down and chug 
drink after dnnk after dnnk without 
any time between? Did you ever 
dnng alcohol and wake up not 
remembering the night before? If 
these things have happened (o you, 
I would like lo give you somethmg 
III think about 

AJcohol overdose, which occurs 
when a person consumes a large 
amount of alcohol over a short peri- 
od of time, could lead lo death. You 
should be aware of the signs of 
alcohol overdose and what can be 
done if you suspect someone has 
reached this poinL 

A Harvard University study indi- 
cates thai college students are par- 
tying harder than ever before 
Forty-four percent of Ibe 17.592 
students surveyed staled they had 
indulged in a dnnking binge within 
the two weeks pnor lo answenng 
the survey. In almost every survey 
on this type of behavior, men were 
found to drink more than women. 
But a study done by Roerchinger 
and Ward found that heavy dnnk- 
ing in the female population has 
more than doubled in the last 
decade, making the amount of 
female drinkers closer to that of 
men. 

Studies also show thai college 
students drink more as they go 
through college. A study done by 
Engs and Hanson found thai 55 per- 
cent of college freshmen drink 
occasionally By the time these stu- 
dents were seniors, that number 
grew to 75 penxnL 

Numerous studies 
have found 



thai would send them over the edge. 
You probably know someone who 
has been in this situation You 
might have laughed and thought the 
person had too good of a tune 
li may be much more sen- 
ous than that. 

If you think a friend 
has overdosed on 
alcohol, you should 
keep these recommenda- 
tions from the Red Cross in; 
mind: 

I If the person has passed out 
and fallen, be may have suffered a 
head or neck injury. He should be 
moved as Utile as possible 

2. To reduce chances of choking, 
turn him on bis side so that if be 
vomits, he wiU be able to clear his 
airway. 



Many people have been 

close to an overdose of 

alcohol, but pass out 

before Ifiey take the last 

few drinks that would send 

therr} over the edge 




3 Do not give the person any- 
thing to eat or drink This could 
cause choking and possible death 

4 If he has stopped breathing, 
begin tescue breathing, as 

laugbt at the Ked 
Cross 

5. In cases in 
which the person is 
unresponsive, call 
911 for emergency 
help. Try not to 
leave the person 
alone. 

Althougb drinking among col- 
lege students occurs more often 
than ever, knowledge and aware- 
ness about alcohol overdose could 
save lives. When you arc at a party. 
keep track of how many drinks you 
are consuming If you do drink, do 
so in moderation 

Being aware of the dangers of 
binge dnnking may convince you 
10 slow down, and also may help 
you prevent a tragedy from occur- 
ring to someone you know

The Writing Center: 
A valuable resource

by AbbaLaRochc

ment, rough draft, or finished draft.

"The Writing

ed OK, " said Jamie Steele, pre-mcd

Modern rock played 
on The Edge 



by Andrew Voder 
Surr Writer 

If you arc jusi recovering from 
major ear surgery or you are like 
mc and always lislen to your 
favorite CD in the car, you may not 
have noticed a new feature of Fon 
Wayne radio I am referriog lo the 
radio siauon 96 3 FM, ■'The Edge." 
Finally, Fon Wayne has a radio sta- 
tion that is dedicated to providing 
modem rock music to area listeners 

"People arc iircd of listening lo 
Bo!iton and 




Bob Segcr, 

They want new music," said 
Debbie Mills, daytime disc 
jockey for 96. 3 

Mills was hired as a full-time Di 
about three weeks ago along with 
three other DJs from the 
Champagne/Urbana area in lUinois. 
Mills was formerly employed at a 
radio station in Carbondale, Ind., 



which is south of Bloomington. She 
has been in the radio business for 
eight years and was able to share 
some insight on how music is 
selected for play on The Edge" 

"People are all at different levels 

musically, and it is our job to kind 

of stay in the middle of those levels 

to provide great music that most 

people will enjoy. " said Mills 

Sean Smyth, program director at 
"The Edge" said he uses this ratio- 
nale along with the opinions of 
some independent consultants to 
determine what music fits into the 
category of "new rock" in Fort 

Wayne 

'ITie negligence of virtually any 
local st:ition to play this modem 
rock was the main driving force 
behind Smyth's decision lo launch 
96.3 FM. The absence of any stu- 
dent-run radio station on the cam- 
pus of IPFW provided additional 
need for college or alternative 
music on the airwaves. 

"The Edge," which is located on 
the comer of Lower Huntington and 
Bluffton Roads, is committed to 
presenting pure modem rock 'n' 
roll, Co-owned by the owners of 
WGL. Fort Wayne's talk radio sta- 




tion. 96.3 FM is also the only radio 
station in the area to have a com- 
pletely talk-free morning show, DJ 
Mills IS very proud of that fact, as 
she feels most morning shows con- 
sist of little more than 'women 
laughing at men's dumb jokes." 

People are taking notice of the 
attention received by the radio 
rookie. Other area stations have fol- 
lowed the lead of 96.3 FM in play- 
ing harder-edged music from 
groups like Offspring which would 
never have been heard in Fort 
Wayne before the advent of "The 
Edge," The increased competition 
has resulted in increased quality in 
several local stations.

Selecting a book list is never

told lo read in high school and only 
a little of ihe required text for col- 
lege courses. With this in mind, I 
am attempting to create a reading 
lisi with at Icasl one book every stu- 
dent can identify. Our topics include 
reference, fiction, biography and 
self-help books. 

My usual crew of experts and 1 
could not agree on a short list of 
books so I had them killed. 

The irony in their death is that 
their opposition to William 
Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" 
doomed dicir existence. In Kunzian 
fashion I had them beheaded and 
have displayed their heads on bam- 
boo pikes by the loading dock 
behind Walb. The rest of the staff 
and 1 dined well thai evening. While 



all their ideas are fresh in my head 
and their blood fresh on my hands, I 
have decided to finish this edition of

GuesI Writer 

It was the first day of school — 
time to meet teachers and students. 
Juggle all those books, and look out 
at a sea of new faces in the balls 
No. I'm noi reminiscing about 
my high school days. This time, 1 
am the teacher 

After seven long years of 
working and sweating, the time 
had finally come: the last 10 
weeks of my college career The 
degree was in sight. All I needed 
to do was finish my student 
teaching. 

Now I'm the one with tests to 
write, papers to grade, and lec- 
tures to plan This is what I 
worked so hard for, but is it really 
what J am meant to do? This, my 
final test, would let me know. 

J was so nervous, I'm sure 
everyone heard my knees knocking. 

Some of my students were 
seniors. The end was in sight for 
them: they wanted to be done In 
some ways we were die same They 
also were ready to put me to the 
test. Was I going lobe lough^ How 
far could 1 be pushed? Could they 
make me cry? (Believe me. they 
tried) 

I also had three sections of 



"sci-fi" series I have read besides 
J.R.R. Tolkien's "Lord of the 
Rings" trilogy. Thomas Covenant is 
a true anii-hero. The character is 
nothing like any ever written. Leper, 
rapist and unbeliever are a few of 
the words which can describe 
Covenant.

News Analysis 



South Side faces scrutiny 



Increased crime, 
lower property value 
causes city to reflect 
on condition of Soutti 
Side 



by Rebeccti Koenig 
Chief Kepurlet 

"Lock your doors if you go 
down 10 thai pari of lowii," 1 
hear my mom's never-ending 
advice once again. Turning 
away. I swallow my initial 
response. "Can"! I be killed here 
on the North Side of lown? Do 
you Ihink the South Side is the 
only place where crime lakes 
place?" 

With modern technology 
today rumors are spread faster 



now than ever. People often 
develop preconceived ideas 
about various things based upon 
little, if any. information, most 
of which is rumor. Likely, this 
is how the South Side of Fort 
Wayne got its violent reputation. 
Names such as Pontiac Street 
and Harma Avenue have become 
infamous. Different streets are 
discussed and stigmatiz£d until, 
even though someone has never 
been there, fear of random vio- 
lence becomes ingrained into a 
person's 





because of its reputation. Rr^t. 
the business distnci has suffered 
from decreased sates, Evidence 
of this can be seen in the prob- 
lems with Souihlown MalL 
Another negative result of the 
Souths 
bad 
TCputa- 



proper- 
ty value. 

The average propcny 
value for Wayne and 
Adams townships is 544,000 
while the average for St. Joe and 
Washington townships is 
S70.000 according to the 1990 
census. The average rent for ihe 
South Side of Fort Wayne is 
$298 while the North Side is 
S378. 

One possible reason for the 
difference was noted in a News- 
Sentinel article in 1978 entided. 
"Neighborhoods Become 
Slums." According to the 
reporter, Mark Helmke. at that 
time "Redlining" was evident in 
Fort Wayne. Redlining is a 
form of racial discrimination 
where more money is budgeted 
for suburbs and very little 
money is allowed for the inner- 
city. The 1990 census supports 
this theory While Wayne and 
Adams townships on average 
were 18.6 percent African 
American and 3.9 percent 



Hispanic, St. Joe and 
Washington townships were 29 
percent African American and 
1.2 percent Hispanic. 

According to the News- 
Sentinel, problems would 
include worse 
ne ighbor- 
hoods. more 
cnme, deseg- 
regation in 
schools and a 
smaller lax 
base. 
Hel mke 's 
version 
agreed with 
the News- 
Sentinel 
To combat this, advertise- 
ments supporting the south side 
of lown have been introduced. 
Souihlown Mall has gained the 
initiative in trying to de-stigma- 
tize Fort Wayne's South Side, 
Ceitainly crime occurs in all 
parts of Fort Wayne, but by 
expecting more crime on the 
South Side, it is almost sure to 
come about. People supporting 
the South Side may be on the 
right track for a solution. 

Thinking back on my moth- 
er's words, I will lock my door 
on the South Side of Fort 
Wayne. I will also lock my 
doors on the north side of Fort 
Wayne In reality, crime is 
everywhere.

Season looking 



up 



for '49ers 



Walcbing ESPN- Prime lime lail 
Sunday evening, a wide grin ctepi 
aciOM my face After all of ihc hoopla 
and lalic surrounding the Dallai and 
San FraneiKo maichup, I could nol 
help bui lo chuckle Bveryone was 
talking aboui bow ihe Cowboys were 
a sboo-in lo all but crush the 'Nincrs. 
The Deionlesa defending Super Bowl 
Champions bad no cbince againsi tbc 
mighty 'Boys. After all. San Fran had 
losi an eye-opening. ahnoM taugbable 
game lo the upsiarf Panlhcn Just one 
week prior lo Ihe Dallas game. 
Without Pro Bowl. Mr. Everything 
Sieve Young, the Forty-Nincrs were 
doomed. So everyone ibougbt, but 
Ifaai Is eitaclly why games arc played 
on Ihe Ticld and not in Ihe imagina- 
tion. 

After all, Elvis was in the house, 
Elvis Grbac. the "Nincr's backup 
quarterback who bad taken his bruises 
both on and off the field in Young's 
absence, picked apart tbc Dallas 
defense like a vulture scavenges a car- 
cass. He threw (or 300 tolal yards and 
avoided tbc misiakca that had plagued 
him in earlier games. Jerry Rice, the 
best receiver ihc game has ever sccn- 
not even Cowboy's fans can deny that 
one- caught five of Orbae's offerings 
for 161 yards. The way San Francisco 
executed George Seifcri's game plan 
made him out to be nothing short of a 

So where was the Dallas defense? 
After all of tbc loud&lt;mouthcd brag- 
gadocian filtb that emanated from 
"Neon" Deion's mouth all week. Ihe 
S35 million dollar man turned in a less 
than stellar performance. The rest of 
the Cowboy's defense did very tilllc 
to compliment their all-star. 
Apparently when it came time to put 
up or shut up. an extra wide piece of 
duct tape should have been placed 
over the collective moulhs of Dallas 
and Ibeit fans. A whole roll could 
have been used lo quiet Mr. Sanders. 

Then there was the Cowboy's 
offense, or tbe lack thereof. After 
Troy Aikman was knoi-kcd from tbe 




ground gained for tbe 'Boys. The 
team's iDlal rushing yardage figured at 
just lOS yards, some 150 yards below 
their season average. Hummmm .. 
maybe spending S35 million on one 
player does not exactly guarantee 
invincibility? Yes, tbe Forty-Niners 
shut up Sanders, sbul down Smiih and 
cmbanassed Cowboy's owner Jerry 
Jones. The smile on my face widened 

II was not aJI the 'Niner's offense 
ihat garnered the win. however. The 
San Francisco defense, a part of the 
team thought to be desperately in need 
after "Neon" Deion's defection, 
forced lour Dallas turnovers. After 
intercepting Aikman and knocking 
him from Ihe game, a relentless 
'Niner's defense forced backup quar- 
Ictback Wade Wilson to throw two 
interceptions of his own. In all. the 
Dallas passing game accounted for a 
mere 188 yards. All-Pro bigmoutb 
Michael Irvin caught only four passes 
for 37 yards. 

So as my grin grew even wider and 
tbe mild chuckle lumed into an all- 
oul. rip-roaring, lear-jerking cry of 
appreciation, the final score flashed 
across tbe screen; San Francisco 38. 
Dallas 20. All at once ii occurred to 
me, sometimes the view from under 
Ihe bleachers ain't so bad after all. 




From the 

Liocker 

Tloom... 

^vith 
Rvan Bond 



In a stale that lives and breathes 
basketball, it is the dream of every high 
school player lo compete at tbe colle- 
giate level. Few realize that goal, even 
fewer advance to the next level The 
difference between a highly touted 
prep player and a successful college 
player is often the abandonment of 
individuality. 

For junior forward Ryan Bond, per- 
sonal accomplishments have taken a 
backseat to team success. Although he 
was chosen to tbc All-GLVC second 
team last season, Bond says bis indi- 
vidual accomplishments are not what 
make him happy. 

"Obviously I am not going lo be 
going lo the NBA or anything, " said 
Bond. " There comes a Imie when you 
just have to be happy with what you 
are doing. Bight now winning makes 
mc happy." 

For Bond and his teammates, it will 
take a coUecUve effort to keep the hap- 
piness flowing The Mastodons com- 
pete against the nation's top talent in 
the Great Lakes Valley Conference. 
Various preseason polls rank four of 
tbc conference's teams in the top 25 

'The better teams in the conference 
are really good, hui 1 think Ihat on any 
given night the best team in the league 
could be beaten by the worst leam. We 
just need lo be more consistent and 1 
think Ihat we will be able to beat tbe 
teams we ore supposed to beat and pull 
a lew upsets," said Bond 

As for Ibis year's Mastodon's bas- 
ketball team. Bond says the guard play 



ha; improved, as well as the overall 
team shootmg 

"Tbc improvement in Ihe guards' 
play will help me oul a lot. Other teams 
won't be able to double team me as 
much," he said. 

Although his personal achievements 
arc noi of utmost importance to him. 
Bond says that finishing among the 
conference's top ten in scoring and 
rebounding are goals he is set on 
achieving. As a sophomore last season. 
Bond led the team in scoring with 1 3 9 
pomts and 6 3 rebounds per gome. He 
tallied a career-high 25 points against 
Quincy University. 

"I would like to be in tbe lop five in 
rebounding and the top 10 in scoring 
this year." said Bond- He reiterated, 
however, Ihai the accomplishment of 
personal goals is not central lo his 
thinking "Penonal goals are not a big 
thing to me I used lo tie very individu- 
ally oncnted m high school but college 
15 aloi different." 

College athletics demands success 
on the couri and in Ihc classroom 

"Sometimes it is really tough I 
think about what it would be like if 1 
was jusi a student. Between school and 
practice it seems like I am constantly 
doing one or the other," said Bond. "It 
lakes a balance between the two." 

The delicate balance between col- 
lege athletics and college sports is one 
of which Bond seems lo have a keen 
grasp. A successful student in tbe 
classroom, he is also a student of the 
game on the baskeiball couii. He views 
bis role on the leam as thai of a leader; 
a member of the team Ihe younger 
players c;m look lo as on example. 



"I think people look to me as one of 
the players with the most experience." 
said Bond. 

A leader on the court, a successful 
student in Ihe classroom and a leam 
player are all demands Bond sees as 
just another aspect of being a student 
and an athlete at IPFW His most 
important role may be that of a public 
relations person of a sorL 

"IPFW 15 growing but I think it is 
essential that we get some of the local 
lalcnl to play here. Tbe [athleticl 



department js doing a good job of 
emphasizing Ihat more but 1 think for 

Ihe program to become successful it 
needs more local players," said Bond. 

After checking his individuality at 
the locker room door and making an 
all-out effort to be an important ingre- 
dient in the team's succ 
6'-7" starling forward si 
the right direction.

HIV/AIDS 

Q&amp;A 



Q, What's the point of 
HIV testing? If you've 
got HIV, you're going to 
die "before your time" 
and why would anyone 
want to know that? 

A. Medicines are now 
available that can prolong 
the period of good health 
and prevent illness in 
people with HIV, Better 
treatments and possibly a 
cure may be found before 
those now infected get sick 
or die. Also, if you are 
infected, you must take 
precautions not to infect 
others.
