Vol. Ill, IsBue I 



September 10, 1971 




PORTRAYS JESUS CHRIST — Billy Barnes plays the lead role of Supei^ 
star in the American Rock Opera production Tuesday night at the 
Scottish Rite Auditorium. "Superstar" is the first in a series of 
convocations sponsored by the Indiana-Purdue Campus. 

Superstar first convocation 
in Indiana-Purdue series 



A performance of "Super- 
star" by the American Rock 
Opera Company is scheduled 
for Tuesday, September 1^, 
at 6 p.m. at the Scottish 
Bite Auditorium. It is the 
opening production in the 
1971-1972 Convocation Ser- 
ies presented by the Indi- 
ana-Jnjrdue Fort Wayne Cam- 
pus. 

The production to be 
seen here will feature a 
black "Superstar," Billy 
Barnes ^ who has received 
rave reviews for his por-- 
trayal of Jesus Christ. 

Free tickets were dis- 
tributed to interested stu- 
dents holding activity 
cards until Tuesday, when 
tickets were made avail- 
able to the general public 
both at the Scottish Rite 
Box Office and at the Of- 
fice of Student Services 
on campus. 

The opera, already a 
best-selling record album, 
chronicles the last seven 
days of Christ's life with 
a pastiche of musical sty- 
les, from rock and jazz to 
traditional Broadway show 
music. In the production, 
Christ is seen as a human 
being rather than as a 
spiritual figure, and an 
analogy between Jesus and 
contemporary rock styles 
has been drawn—thus the 
title. 



The score for the per- 
formance here will contain 
songs from the well-known 
album as well as several 
other musical numbers. A- 
mong these include an "A- 
mazing Grace" prelude and 
"The Lord's Prayer," which, 
according to Don Lewis of 
the Milwaukee Journal, "is 
moving"ly sung by Barnes, 
who has not only a smooth 
and tasteful voice but al- 
so a commanding stage per- 
formance. " 

When "Superstar" was 
performed in the old Ara- 
gon Ballroom in Chicago in 
July, the Sun-Times critic 
said "(It) was so good, so 
cleansing. A music hall 
turn for Pontius Pilate and 
a big hand. A bow for 
Judas after his big number. 
And I thought the first 
time that all the silent 
reverence of the faith was 
after the fact, that when 
Jesus said 'The meek shall 
inherit the earth,' He pro- 
bably paused with a small 
smile on His face for the 
applause to die down while 
an old man with one eye 
shrieked 'The Caesar!'" 

Other major roles in the 
show are played by Denny 
Belline who performs Judas 
Iscariot; Gini Eastwcod, 
as ^ary I'lagdalene ; and joe 
Morton doubling as either 
Gaiaphas or Pontius Pilate. 



Souder returns 

from national 
YAF convention 

Congratulations to Mark 
Souder, who has just re- 
turned from the national 
convention of the Young Am- 
ericans for Freedom (YAF) 
held recently in Houston, 
Texas. Although unsucces- 
sful in his bid for nation- 
al office, Souder conduct- 
ed am .aggressive campaign 
managed by hi? campaign 
chairman, Mark Franke, lU- 
PU Regional Student Body 
President. Kike Ellis, 
hike Pfundstein, and Stan 
Jones were also delegates 
to the convention. 

One of the major decis- 
ions ma(Je by the young con- 
servative activists was to 
withdraw their support of 
President Nixon and to 
transfer it to Vice-Pres- 
ident Spiro T. Agnew and 
James Buckley whom they en- 
dorsed for President and 
Vice-President, respect- 
ively, in the coming nat- 
ional elections. 




MAHK SOUDER 

Others nominated for the 
endorsement vote which se- 
lected Agnew and Buckley 
included YAF founding fa- 
ther, William F. Buckley, 
California Governor Ronald 
Reagan, and Senator Barry 
Goldwater. Nixon was nom- 
inated by a token gesture- 
a motion which was noisily 
greeted by the boos and 
catcalls of the delegates 
on the nomination floor. 
Subsequent voting resulted 
in Nixon receiving less 
than a 1% vote of confid- 
ence.

Greetings, lovers of 
fine literature I Here, 
buri:d in this year's 
first Communicator, is the 
first in a weekly (maybe) 
series of columns devoted 
to commentary on student 
affairs, civic happenings. 
Student Government capers, 
Administration follies, 
and other nondescript dri- 
vel. 

If you're a typical 
student, you'll undoubted- 
ly skip this during the 
rest of the year, even if 
you do bother to read a- 
nother Communicator. But 
for the EHke of those not 
totally coi.'nitted to apathy, 
you may find this column 
mildly interesting. By 
the way, any expressions 
of opinions, slanders, and 
such found in this column 
are probably not represen- 
tative of the policy of 
this rag. 

I would like to welcome 
all truthseekers, freaks, 
fascists, and freshmen to 
River Campus. Here's hop- 
ing that you are rewarded 
in your endeavors this 
year. 

For all those poor fish 
who didn't tsike advantage 
of Alpa Phi Omega's Book 
Exchange to save money; 
Bemember: Apathy, like 
chastity, is its own pun- 
ishment. Anyway, a salute 
is in order to the men of 
A.P.O. 

This is an amazing campus 
that we are privelegedto 
attend. Where else can 
one go to a school which 




(. Thanks 



by Barb Shaft 

has TWO powerhouses to sup- 
ply light and heat to OIJE 
building? Why? Because 
someone screwed up, why 
else? When planning this 
campus originally, it was 
thought that back by the 
lagoon would be a perfect 
place 'for a powerplant. 
And thus it came to be 
built in that place. When 
planning for the new build- 
ings, however, our fine 
fairly new (about 8 years 
old) powerplant was declar- 
ed to be obsolete and in 
the way. So now we've got 
a new powerplant arising 
behind the pines across 
the lagoon (or what's left 
of the lagoon). What a 
pity. Had "Those in Pow- 
er" used even sufficient 
foresight, the money that 
has been spent on this 
homegrown boondoggle 
might have been used on 
our so-far nebulous park- 
ing garage. Oh well. Who 
cares? It's only students' 
money. 

Since we've spent money 
on ice rinks, bowling 
rights, basketball courts, 
and frisbees, why don't we 
go all the way and get a 
couple of canoes for use 
by students? After all, 
we are on a river and can- 
oing is good healthy ex- 
ercise. With suitable pre- 
cautions taken, it could 
be as safe as any of the 
other sports and wouldn't 
break any windows. 

Peace and Love, 
B.S. 



To the editors 

Dear Editors: 

I am not really writing 
this letter to you, but I 
would like to take this 
opportunity to express a 
viewpoint that I feel very 
strongly about to the stu- 
dent community here at the 
regional campus. 

Recently young people 
have gained the right to 
vote in this great Nation 
of ours. Because of this, 
some young people have act- 
ually registered to vote 
and are actively involved 
in politics. But I fear 
that a great number of 
these new possible voters 
will not bother to either 
register or to vote or to 
even think about the many 
problems and challenges 
that we face today as a peo- 
ple. Surveys prove all 
that I have said — the 
younger the person the 
least likely he or she will 
vote. 

It seems that many today 
have all the answers to 
the important questions of 
the day, but when it comes 
to trying to solve the pro- 
blem or to offer assistance 
little is done. If this 
trend is continued, our 
Country will surely self- 
destruct in a few short 
years. I hope that we i the 
new voters of America, will 
become more involved in 
politics and with our fel- 
low mEin, otherwise the fu- 
ture will hold dark days. 
I personally am work- 





N^ 



Well, vacation time is 
over and most of us are 
back prowline the halls of 
good old lU-EU Regional. 
It seems like things should 
soon be returning back to 
where they were last Spring, 
even though we know they 
won't be. For one thing, 
mar.y old faces are gone 
and many new faces have 
taken their place. All 
those bewildered faces are 
reminiscent of those days 
when the rest of us were 
trying to locate exotic 
places like G46 or T12B, 
or maybe just the bath- 
room. 

At any rate, we all are 
at the beginning of a new 
experience, and new exper- 
iences seem to be God's 
way of savine hi. Fear of 
the unknoim is natural, but 
once this fear is overcome, 
a fresh start becomes the 
sweetest gift that a per- 
son can receive. New be- 
ginnings help us to rea- 
lize that yesterday's mis- 
takes don't have to be re- 
peated or lived with. To~ 
morrow can be a better day 
and tomorrow's world can 
be a better place because 
of new beginnings. Once a 
person realizes this, he 
begins to really live. He 
may even get to the point 
where he enjoys the begin- 
nings of a new semester... 
maybe. 

New classes are always 
sort of scai7, but when 
you think that you will 
have a chance to share the 
life experiences of twenty 
to thirty students and the 
instructor , things seem 
somehow different — they 
get downright terrifying ; 
If you are lucky enough to 
get to class early, yours 
can be part of the millions 
of eyes who assault the 
poor unfortunate latecom- 
ers. If you are the late, 
look nonchalant, hold your 
chin up, and pray brother 
and sister, pray. For 
some reason I always happ- 
en to be one of the latter, 
and I always enter the 
classroom feeling like a 
nudist tiding to sneaJc in- 
to church unnoticed. 

Eyes front and the in- 
structor begins to read 
from the holy book of 
"Youhaves." 52? things 
"you have" to complete be- 
fore the end of the semes^ 
ter in order to avoid ter-^ 
rible things like F's or 
I's or even, it seems by 



then, bad breath. It is 
hard to believe that less 
than an hour ago you were 
actually excited about be- 
ing back in school as you 
sit there writing and tremb- 
ling and wondering how 
xn homework you are going 
to get all. this done by 
Christmas. Finally, it is 
over and you rush desper- 
ately to the students' 
■sanctuary, the Cafeteria. 
At this point even heart- 
burn seems preferable to 
homework. 

The Cafeteria is pure 
pandemonium as new friend- 
ships are formed and old 
ones are renewed. Lucky 
travellers are telling 
tales of European adven- 
tures to enraptured pea- 
sants (like myself) who 
had to stay behind in the 
clutches of the capitalis- 
tic establishment in or- 
der to earn the fall's 
tuition. The Greeks are 
seen loafing around with 
their paddles while the 
Freaks are on the scene 
padding around in their 
loafers.... All in all it 
is good to be back. 
PEACE.

ing for the Republican 
Party and I am heading up 
Mayor Zeis' youth campaign. 
But even though I feel that 
registering young people 
will favor the Democrats 
slightly, I still am very 
much involved with Suffrage 
'71 and with registering 
students here on the cam- 
pus. This is how strongly 
I feel about it. No mat- 
ter who you are or what 
political party you favor, 
by all means register and 
viTte, and better yet work 
for the political party of 
your choice. Only by in- 
volvement in our political 
system, and by relating to 
each other will we "get it 
together. " 

In ending I would like 
to refer to a quote 
that answers very well the 
statements and questions 
condemning politics and in- 
volvement made by Edmxind 
Burke: "The only thing 
necessary for the triumph 
of evil is for good men to 
do nothing . " In a demo- 
cracy, the place to improve 
the quality of government 
and of the environment is 
in the voting booth and in 
involvement.

S G provides 
counseling 

This Fall, student gov- 
ernment is starting a 
counseling program design- 
ed to aid the incoming 
freshmen. 

The purpose of the pro- 
gram is to complement the 
present counseling system 
by providing services 
which aren't now available 
to freshmen. According to 
student government presi- 
dent Mark Franke, "The 
faculty counseling system 
provides virtually no 
counseling in many areas 
of student needs." He al- 
so called the system "too 
formal," and hopes to ach- 
ieve a more personal rela- 
tionship between freshmen 
and upperclassmen. 

Each upperclassman vol- 
unteering for the program 
will be assigned up to ten 
freshmen. They will be 
expected to establish 
friendships and give ad- 
vice to the freshmen. 

Any interested upper- 
classmen should contact 
Georjean Hazelton, student 
government communications 
director, in room G4. 

Reel life at 
River Campus 

Indiana- Purdue Univer- 
sity's Film Series for 
1971-1972, in its second 
week, will present "Report 
From China" today (Friday). 
The 90-minute, color Jap- 
anese film, released in 
1966-67, will be shown in 
Room 146 at 4:^0 p.m., 
7 p.m., and 9=50 p.m. 

The film will feature 
China during the height of 
i'^ao ' s Great Cultural Re- 
volution as seen over a 
six-month period through 
the eyes and lenses of a 
professional Japanese cam- 
era team. 

The film goes beyond 
scenes of the red guards 
and wall newspapers to de- 
vote the greatest portion 
of its report to the daily 
life and productive act- 
ivities of the Chinese 
people. 

The result is an im- 
pressive film repgrt, in- 
valuable for sociological, 
geographical, historical, 
and political studies for 
years to come. The fort- 
eignproduction is narrat- 
ed in English. 

The weekly movie for 
next Friday is titled "The 
400 Blows." It will be 
shown at the same place at 
the same times. 



Suffrage 
reaches 

With the adoption of 
the 26Ui amendment to the 
U.S. Constitution by the 
required number of states, 
many people, from the Pres- 
ident of the United States 
to the many student body 
Presidents on College 
campuses across this coun- 
try, have urged the newly 
enfranchised young people 
to register and eventually 
vote. Port Wayne is no 
different. 

During the month of Aug- 
ust, a WKJG radio jockey 
by the name of Steve Shine, 
who is a student at Indiana 
University in Bloomington 
had the idea to organize 
a group that would encour- 
age young people to regis- 
ter and Tiote called 
Suffrage 71. He then 
proceeded to contact people 
in the community who he 
thought would assist him 
in his objective. And 
after this, just before he 
returned to his school, 
Steve produced public ■ ser- 
vice ads for Suffrage 7I 
that are now appearing both 
-on local radio and tele- 
vision. 

At present, people like 
Charles Weinraub, a local 
attorney, and Mark Franke, 
the I.U.-P.U. student body 
president here; and organ- 
izations like Young World 
Developement (Dan Bemnlng 
and Glenn Teschendorf are 
doing most of the work on 
their part) and both the 
Republican and Democratic 
Parties are carrying on the 
work of Suffrage 71. 

It is a very loose 
organization, but they 
hope to register a great 
many of the new voters 
before they are done. For 
example, they are having 
registration drives on all 
of the local college 
campuses and will shortly 
be doing the same in the 
high schools. On Monde^, 
September IJlb for example, 
they will register people 
at South Side High School 
and will have a special 
program consisting of

YAF's return from Houston 



by Mike Pfundstein 

Over a thousand members 
of Young Americans for 
Freedom met in Houston, 
Texas over the Labor Day 
weekend. From the first 
moment of the convention 
to the last, Indiana was 
the forefront of continu- 
ous conflict. Among the 
delegates from Fort v/ayne 
were Mark Franke, Hark 
Sender, Mike Pfundstein, 
Stan Jones and Mike Ellis. 

The roots of the con- 
flict grew from the cam- 
paign of Louisa Porter 
for National Board. She 
was vehemently opposed 
by an overwhelming major- 
ity of Indiana, her home 
state, but was one of those 
anointed by the national 
organization to be one of 
nine candidates to be el- 
ected. Knowing full well 
that no candidate in the 
history of YAF has ever 
won against the active op- 
position of the organi- 
zation, the majority of 
Indiama delegates united 
around Mark Souder. 

R. Emmett Tyrrell, ed- 
itor of the Alternative ,, 
served as Souder' s camp- 
aign manager, ^iark Franke, 
Student Body President at 
this campus, was in charge 
of delegate coordination, 
Morton Blackwell , a pro- 
fessional campaign organ- 
izer, was flown in to coor- 
dinate the campaign. N. 
Stanton LVans, author and 
conservative leader, held 
a reception for Souder. 
Jameson Campaignl, Jr., 
son of the editor of the 
Indianapolis Star , nomi- 
nated Souder. Jay Parker, 
the first black National 
Board member of YAF, sec- 
onded Souder' s nomination. 

In spite of all these 
efforts, Souder's campaign 
simply could not overcome 
the organization. Souder 
finished tenth, leading 
the non-organization candi- 
dates. He 'got over 40% of 
the vote in spite of ex- 
treme pressures. The maj- 
or bases of this support 
were California, Indiana 
and Illinois, with sub- " 
stantial dissident support 
in New York and Pennsyl- 
vania, 

The national organiza- 
tion's railroad continued 
on into the mock president- 
ial nomination convention. 
Over twenty-five candidates 
were nominated. Among the 
nominees were Adolph Goers, 
conservative brewer of 
Coors beer; Ha^r Richard 
Daley, "he goes through 
reformers like crap through 



®

a goose;" and Senator Joe 
McCarthy, "I nominate a 
main who has truly lived up 
to the slogan better dead 
than Ked . " Mark Franke 
nominated Senator Henry 
Jackson, a Democrat from 
Washington. Mark Souder 
nominated M. Stanton Evans, 
Indiana's favorite son. 

In spite of a facade of 
democracy, once again the 
the organization rammed 
through their choices, 
Spiro Agnew for President 
and James Buckley for Vice- 
President. In spite of a 
majority of verbal opposi-r 
tion, the nomination was 
declared unanimous. Fur- 
thermore, a release was 
issued saying that Agnew 
and Buckley had been nomi- 
nated and made unanimous, 
prior to the beginning of 
the mock convention! Jon 
Meyer, son of author Frank 
Meyer and National YAF 
Board member, said that 
the organization spent so 
much time "screwing" Souder 
they wound up messing up 
everything else. Randal 
Teague, the Executive Dir- 
ector of YAF, apologized 
for the handling of the 
mock convention, but the 
damage had been done. 

YAF members from Fort 
Wayne came home discourag- 
ed with the tactics of the 
organization leaders but 
.determined to consolidate 
■their control of YAF in 
'Indiana £ind the Midwest 
with other dissident YAFers 
from elsewhere for a fu- 
ture takeover attempt, 
since for young conserva- 
tives, alternatives are 
few. 



The Indiana-Purdue 
chapter of Circle K 
International spent this 
summer's hiatus busily 
engaged in various projects 
and social activities. 
For service, the club 
spent the last Sunday in 
May erecting soccer goals 
in front of the Fort Wayne 
Children's Home. This 
project climaxed a month 
of securing sports equip- 
ment and financial donations 
to the Home. 

During June, a lake 
party was held at the cot- 
tage of Randy Stuckey. 
In July, a day was spent 
at Cedar Point. August 
held the most work because 
of the "Save America Run," 
This 2900-mile run was 
accomplished by two Circle K 
men from Trinity College 
in Deerfield, Illnois, 
Tony and Joel Alstrum ran 
from Long Beach, California, 
to Long Beach, New York. 
At every stop they would 
talk to people about the 
pollution problem. Various 
pamphlets and literature 
were distributed to all 
interested individuals. 

While in Eastern Indiana, 
the men stayed at Kevin 
Houser's home in Butler. 
The Circle K Club arranged 
for advance publicity. 
When they arrived on Aug- 
ust 24, they received an 
interview on WKJG and a 
tour of the city's pollution 
control methods. 

The month was ended when 
six delegates were sent to 
the international convention 
ready for an early October 
opening.

Able expresses needs of disabled 



by 

Marty M. 



One of the newest or- 
ganizations at lU-PU R^- 
ional is being organized 
by Brock Able for the bene- 
fit of all students inter- 
ested in the special pro- 
blems faced by the physi- 
cally disabled students on 
campus. The purpose of 
the organization is to pro- 
vide reptresentation for the 
physically disabled, and to 
provide social activities 
which involve the entire 
student body, yet allow 
the physically disabled 
student to participate ful- 
ly. ■ . 

"Inconveniences which 
are minor to an ambulatoiy 
student," said Brock, "may 
be major obstacles to a 
person in a wheelchair. 
Sometimes it will take as 
long as fifteen minutes 
for a physically disabled 
student to get from one 
class to another if the 
next class is on a differ- 
ent floor." 

A student in a wheel- 
chair can only change 
floors by elevator, and 
oftentimes the elevators 
are full of people saving 
an extra few seconds by 
riding instead of walking 
up the stairs. The result 
is that a disabled student 
has to miss elevator after 
elevator until one going 
in the right direction fin- 
ally arrives with enough 
room left for him to sque- 
eze into. By this time, 
class has usually started, 
and the disabled student 
arrives late. 

In considering the spec- 
ial problems faced by the 
handicapped student, sev- 
eral interesting facts e- 
merge. For example, the 
one bathroom which a stu- 
dent in a wheelchair can 
use is located in the 
basement, and it can take 
as long as twenty minutes 
for him to get there. 
There are only two door- 
ways where a student in a 
wheelchair can enter or e- 
xit the building:: at the 
loading docks and at the 
east entrance. If he gees 
out by way of the loading 
docks, he still has an 
eight inch curb to negot- 
iate. 

If he is unfortunate e- 
nough to need a drink of 
water, he must wait until 
he can maneuver down to 
the Cafeteria where there 
are cups for him to use. 
Then, if they are cut of 
cups, he is out of luck. 
In case of stn emergency, 
these difficulties may be- 
come a death sentence! 

A person in a wheelchair 
has only one route he *can 
follow in exiting the 



building; up the hall to 
the elevator, wait until 
it arrives with enough 
room for him to enter, 
ride down to the groiind 
floor, out of the elevator 
and up the hall to the 
east entrance, and finally 
out of the building. 




Brock Able 

The situation is not 
hopeless, however, as 
Brock's efforts are begin- 
ning to bear fruit. On 
July 50, 1971* Student ben- 
ate Resolution 7172-FF 
was approved and" submitted 
to the campus administra- 
tion. Dr. Kenneth L. 
Keller, Assistant Dean for 
Administration commented 
that all but one of the 



ing studied by the build- 
ing committee. 

Eestrooms are another 
item which will receive re- 
evaluation, as current 
building plans call for 'one 
per building rather than 
one per floor as called for 
in Student Resolution 7172- 
FF Handicapped Students . 

"Much more needs to be 
accomplished in terms of 
responsibly voicing the 
special needs of the phy- 
sically disable student," 
Brock said, "and we have 
so far only considered the 
needs of the non-ambula- 
tory students. Otherwise 
disabled students have 
different, though no less 
severe , difficulties. " 

The more subtle problems 
faced by disabled students 
become obvious only from 
first hand experience. 
One of the major purposes 
of the organization 'iis to 
provide this experience 
through contact between 
the disabled and the non- 
disabled through personal 
interaction on various le- 
vels such as social, and 
educational. 



eight items of the resolu- 
tion were being worked in- 
to the new buildings. The 
one item which had not 
been considered concerns 
the water fountains. The 
resolution calls for at 
least one fountain per 
floor to be no more than 
36 inches off the floor. 
This item is currently be-

Izaak Walton plans projects AbOUttOWn 



The Student Alpha Chap- 
ter of the Izaak Walton 
League is continuing its 
efforts to maintain a heal- 
thy environment. Plans 
for the coming year in- 
clude a reseeding project, 
the planting of Crovm 
Vetch along the river banks 
of the St, Joe^ helping 
with plans for a campus 
arhoretum, and sponsoring 
a Third Annual Teach-in in 
the spring. 

Hopefully^ the reseed- 
ing project of the river 
banks will stop the pre- 
sent erosion problem. The 
area of most concern is 
the west bank of the river 
near the free lot. The 
area will have to be grad- 
ed, raked, and carefully 
covered after it has be re- 
seeded. ■ The presence of 
the grass reduces the ajoount 
of ground run-off entering 
the river after a heavy a- 
inount of rain. This will 
be completed before the 
fall rains begin. 

The planting of Crown 
Vetch, a spreading vine, 
is to be on the eastern 
hank of the St. Joe near 
the power plant and the 
surrounding area. A great - 
deal of erosion has occur- - 
red there and the planting . 
of this vine provides a 
natural way to help pre- 
vent further wasting away 
of the ground. In the 
wild, flowers and vines ^ 
naturally grow on mount-~ 
ain sides and rocky slopes. 
Here the implantation would 
curtail the amount of silt 
now entering the river a- 
•round the area. Along with 
an increased ecological 
value, there is also an in- 
crease of scenic beauty. 

Other projects being 
considered by the Izaak 
Walton League are a Free 
University class, clean up 
projects on the campus, and 
helping at Camp Red Cedar. 
Camp Red Cedar ia a unique 
camp designed as a living 
experience of man's effect 
on his environment.

France was a trip 



What would you say if 
your French aunt offered 
to finance your three- 
month stay in France? 
Naturally, when I was ask- 
ed, I jumped at the chance. 
It thrilled me to think 
that I'd be spending my 
whole summer visiting rela- 
tives, friends, and the 
country of my ancestoral 
heritage. 

Before I had time to 
realize it, I was winging 
my way to Europe on an Air 
France Boeing 747. The 
minute that I stepped down 
at Orly Airport in Paris, 
my adventure began. 

While I. stayed in that. 
city, I had an opportunity 
of visiting many of its 
interesting monuments; the 
gracefully structured 
Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame 
with its over-hanging 
vines that touch the Seine, 
the magnificent Arc de 
Triomphe, and the gleaming 
white Sacre Coeur church, 
situated high on a hill. 

As mid-June rolled around, 
I started a series of short 
visits to various parts of 
France. The first of 
these was a pilgrimage to 
the Catholic shrine of 
Lourdes, a small village 
nestled in the Pyrenees 
mountains. 

During the month of 
July, I traveled to Camac 
in Brittany, and to the 
French Alps. It was on an 
Alpine farm that I first 
learned how to milk a cow 
and bundle hay. It doesn't 
sound like much, but to a 
city girl who's never 
before had the occasion, 
it was a refreshing exper- 
ience, I spent the first 



half of August in Vieux- 
Eoncau, a small sea resort 
on the south-western coa^ 
of France, ahd by the end 
of the month found myself 
back in Paris getting ready 
to go home. 

So many splendid mem - 
ories flooded back as I 
was packing. The beaut- 
iful country-side that I 
had enjoyed CEune back in 
vivid mental pictures: the 
mighty blue alps, the soft 
rolling Pyrenees, the mag- 
nificent , ever-changing 
sea, and all those lovely 
flowers in every garden. 

The cities that I vis- 
ited are lively, throbbing 
communities that reek with 
ancient history. The peo- 
ple are so warm and bubbling, 
and constantly showing me 
such kindness and fine hos- 
pitality. 

The food was an exciting 
experience in itself. 
Tastefully prepared dishes 
were served for every meal. 
Every meal was followed by 
mellow red wine, an assort- 
ment of delicious cheeses, 
and mouth-watering pastries. 

Yes, it was, indeed, a 
splendid time spent, and 
will be a never-ending 
soured of enjoyment to me. 
Perhaps one day, you will 
also have the chance of 
visiting Europe for the 
summer. When you return 
to school following your 
memorable experience, 
Marty might just walk up 
to you and ask, "Care to 
write your story for the 
Communicator? "

Job placement offered 



This summer while most 
students were working in 
order to get together the 
necessary capital for their 
education, Indiana and 
Purdue Universities were 
consolidating the student 
services operations of 
both institutions into the 
streamlined operation now 
found just off the Stu- 
dent Lounge in rooms 102, 
105, 104, and 105. 

Job placement activity, 
which was scattered 
throughout numerous cam- 
pus offices, will new be 
centered in Room 105. 
This central Placement Of- 
fice will work with both 
Indiana and Purdue stu- 
dents for part-time and 
permanent placement oppor- 
tunities. All on-campus 
job interviewing activi- 
ties of graduation stu- 
dents will be scheduled by 
this office on an advance 
sign-up basis. In order 
to be eligible to conduct 
interviews, students must 
be registered with the 
Placement Office. 

Placement Office Activ- 
ity will be coordinated by 
Hr. Larry Scott and Mr. 
William Heller, who will 
be assisted by their sec- 
retary Mrs. Nancy Grand- 
staff. 



Students wishing placement 
counselling or assistance 
should contact Krs. Grand- 
staff at Ext. 520 for ap- 
pointments with either Mr. 
Scott or Mr. Heller. 

Placement Office regis- 
tration meetings for Ind- 
ifiina and Purdue students 
will be held in the near 
future. Watch the Commun- 
icator for announcements 
'concerning these registra- 
tion meetings, as well as 
other placement news 
throughout the year.

settled into the routine of stu- 
dying as they near the second 
week of the Fall, 1971 semester.

The Outstanding Educat- 
ors of America is an annual 
program honoring disting- 
uished men and women for 
their except: onal service, 
achievements, and leader- 
ship in the field of educa- 
tion. Guidelines for sel- 
ection include an educat-

New parkJng lot 
located here 

Aa classes begin this 
fall, students of lU-FU 
will have 200 additional 
parking spaces to fight 
for, A temporary gravel 
lot is nearing completion 
on the west side of the Ed- 
ucation Building. 

Dailey Asphalt construc- 
ted the 200-space riverbank 
let for a cost of 812,141, 
The lot will contain A and 
B parkers. 

Objection was raised 
last summer by several en- 
vironmental groups toward 
building the lot next to 
the riverbank. Their op- 
inion was that the lot 
would be better placed else- 
where on campus. One space 
mentioned was the area on 
the south edge of the cam- 
pus. 

Administration repre- 
sentatives stated that the 
proposed area on the south 
side would create a tre- 
mendous traffic problem. 
They also emphasized that 
the new lot would be tem- 
porary. It will be seed- 
ed again with grasseed, 
and take from three to 
five years to be totally 
restored.

Freedom lies on the far side of discip 
line; the present may only be inhabited 
by the man who lives in full resonance 
with his past and future; awareness is 
complete only when it vibrates with memory 
and expectation; spontaneity belongs 
only to the person who has taken respotn- 
sibility for his projections; innocence 
is recovered only after complusion has 
been recognized. Freedom, seasoned in- 
nocence, spontaneity, novelty, living in 
the present are marks of maturity which 
are gained only by the long process of 
finding one's way back from the exile 
which culture, ignorance, and cowardice 
impose upon us all.

City acquires 
radio station 



Wayne will stor 
educational iJW 



Fort 
have 
station. 

WGRO-denoting growth, 
will feature full length 
plays, poetry readings, 
City Council and School 
Board Meetings, club forums 
and activities from the 
community, and WGRO's own 
news from various sources, 

WGRO's purposes will .be 
the educational orienta- 
tion of the community to 
what the broadcast media 
has to offer them, and al- 
so for the community to 
participate in the content 
of the programs. 

WGRO will be owned and 
operated by Deadringer — a 
nonprofit oi^anization. 
Deadringer is a collective 
of several people whose 
main concern is the media, 
but maintain an active in- 
terest in all other aspects 
of the new culture, 

WGRO is federally fund- 
ed, but must put up 25% of 
the cost through community 
support. With the help of 
the community, the educa- 
tional station will become 
a reality. One way that 
WGRO will be supported will 
be through subscription to 
.it's programming magazine- 
which will cost 12 dollars 
a year. By Subscribing, a 
person will have a voice 
in the programming and will 
be urged to produce his 
own tapes for programming. 

One of the advantages 
of the station will be that 
it is solely educational. 
In this respect, students 
from the area universities 
will be able to work on the 
staff and will earn credits 
at the same time through 
cooperation with the local 
universities. 

If you're interested in 
educational radio and wEtnt 
to know what you can do to 
help, contact Deadringer 
at 1253 Laie Avenue, Fort 
Wayne, 46805..
