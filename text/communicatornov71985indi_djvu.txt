Search begins for chancellor 



and 

MICHELE SHAFFER 

Managing Editor 

The search for a new chancellor 
began Oct. 31 when Purdue University 
President Sleven Beering met for the 
first time wilh ihe 17 member search 
and screen committee. 

In a letter to Donald Brown, vice 
chancellor of Purdue Academic Ser- 
vices, who will serve as chairman of the 
commitlee, Beering said "In order to 
facilitate the administrative aspects of 
the search," John Huie, executive 
assistant lo Beering, would serve as 
secretary lo the commitlee. 

Michael Downs, chairman of the 
IPFW political science department, 
resigned his position on the committee 
because he felt the commitlee should be 
chaired by a local member of the 
faculty, community or administration. 
Downssaid he expressed his feelings on 
this matter in his resignation letter to 



INDIANA UNIVERSITY 



PURDUE UNIVERSITY 

AT FORT WA Y N E 




Beering, "I thought this campus was 
mature enough that the community, 
students, faculty, ... could conduct their 
own search," said Downs Tuesday. 

Downs mentioned the past two search 
and screen committees for chancellors 
at IPFW were chaired by local people. 
The first search and screen committee 
was co-chaired by Henry Rood and 
Waller Helmke, Sr. The lasl search and 



screen committee was chaired by 
Raymond Pippert, professor of 
mathematics. Downssaid, "1 think this 
established an important precedent on 
this campus " 

However, an undisclosed source said 
she was informed by Beering it is 
Purdue policy to have the chairman of 
the commitlee hold a higher position 



than the position being filled. This was 
affirmed by John Coggins, dean of 
students of Purdue University, West' 
ville, who said, "We've just concluded 
one (a search committee) for vice 
chancellor of academic services &lt;at 
Weslville) ." Coggins stated Ihis 
committee was chaired by Dale 
Alspaugh, chancellor of Purdue 
University, Weslville. 

Downs, who was replaced on the 
committee by Clifford Scott, associate 
professor of history, said "I was op- 
posed lo anyone who is not on this 
faculty or who doesn't live in this 
community to chair it ilhe search and 
screen committee)." 

Beering was unavailable for com- 
ment. Edward Nicholson, acting 
chancellor, refused lo comment on the 
search and screen committee, advising 
The Communicator to speak with 
Brown When asked if he has declared 
his candidacy for the chancellor's 
position. Nicholson again refused 
comment.

FDA schedules consumer exchange meeting 



By EARL SMITH 

Chief Reporter 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has scheduled a consumer exchange 
meeting on Nov. 14 in the Ballroom of Walb beginning al 7:30 p.m. 

"We will be looking at three rather large issues," said LynGoossens, Consumer 
Information Officer with the FDA. She and Allen L, Hoeling, disUnct officer, will 
be gathering information which will be used in Congressional testimony during 
early 1936. 

One issue the FDA wants opinions on is whether Kelloggs is mis-labeling their 
high-fibre cereals. The boxes say research has shown low fibre diets contribute to 
the onset of cancer and imply that eating Kelloggs hi0i fibre cereal will lessen the 
chances of contracting cancer. This has caused some companies to complain. 

The FDA wants to know whether health claims on food packages shotJd be 
regulated. "We are paid to be doubling Thomases, " said Goossens. The ultimate 
question is whether the FDA should be more involved in food labeling than it is 
now, said Goossens. 

The information obtained on the Kelloggs issue will be used during committee 
hearings in January or February, said Goossens. 



A second issue involves in-vilro diagnostic, or self-testing, products. The most 
popular product in this category is the pregnancy lest, Another well-known self- 
lesting product is for cancer of the colon. 

Whether these products are serving their intended purpose has been questioned, 
said Goossens. "The labeling must be simple enough so people will understand that 
these I products 1 arejusta screening process," said Goossens. 

People commonly misinterpret the results of home tests or get false reading for 
one reason or another, said Goossens. Home tests are not foolproof and should be 
considered preliminary. "It's one thing lo monitor a condition and another lo 
diagnose a disease," said Goossens. 

The FDA will be writing new regulations on self-test products during the next 
few months. 

The third area of labeling concerns how fats, oils and cholesterol should be listed 
on food labels The FDA also wants to know whether additional public information 
and education regarding cholesterol is needed, said Goossens Even a person who 
eals choleslerol-free food will have a cholesterol level because the body produces 
it. 



Students' Government approves nominees 



ByEARLSIVIITH 

Chief Reporto' 
"I have drafted a letter to all 

presidents of student organizations 
asking them to nominate individuals for 
SUBOG (Studenl Union Board of 
Governors),'" said Joe Motherwell, 
Students Government president, at the 
Oct. 30 Student Senate meeting. 
Motherwell thanked those who have 
recruited students for Student Senate 
positions and encouraged, them to 
recruit students for SUBOG as well. 

SUBOG is the activity branch of 
Students Government. It organizes 
trips, lectures, parties, and the film 
series. 



Senator Sandra Flum presented the 
names of three students to fill the 
remaining vacancies Each was ap-

student governments of their high 
schools. 

The Student Senate has yet to appoint 



a clerk to record the minutes and a 
parliamentarian. Interested students 
should contact Brad Miller. Students 
Government vice-president. 

Gina Kosloff was elected president 
pro-lempore at the Oct 30 meeting. It 
will be her responsibility lo conduel 
Student Senate meetings when the 
Students Government vice-president is 
absent. 

Kosloff reported the legislative af- 
fairs committee has decided to revise 
bill &amp;see-7 regarding Students Govern- 
ment office and equipment use. "We 
feel the Senate should develop a pohcy 
rather Ihan leave the responsibility to 



the istudenl governmenl) officers," 
Kosloff told The Communicator 

Senator Polly Dean reported the 
results of a recent meeting with north- 
east Indiana slate legislators. 

Vice-President Miller reported he 
had investigated the need for more stop 
signs on campus. "It seems there is a 
larger problem with enforcing 
crosswalk regulations," said Miller. 

Alumm are not allowed lo use the 
electric typewriters in the library 
because of studenl governmenl 
regulations, said Senator Pat Patrick. 
Patnck will draft a bill allowing alumni 
association members lo use the 
typewriters.

Characteristics of a new 
chancellor for IPFW 



Finally, a search and screen 
committee at IPFW to review 
candidates for a "(ull-time chancellor" 
has been named. 

We've been without a chancellor for 
over a year. Last year, the upheaval 
over Chancellor Joseph Giusli leaving 
for Washington. D.C. left the 
administration and much of the campus 
wondering who their supervisor was. It's 
obvious the morale and eagerness of the 
faculty and organizations has been 
harmed by 6uch lack of leadership. 

Now that the search and screen 
committee has been named, they should 
keep in mind several factors. 

According to Purdue President Steven 
Beering, the new chancellor should be a 
proven administrator and manager, and 
an experienced teacher and scholar. 
That is exactly what IPFW needs right 
now: a solid, proven manager to redirect 
this campus toward higher excellence 
and standards, l 

Secondly, the search for a chancellor 
should be a national search. The 
candidates should have the respect of 
university administrators across the 
state, as well as across the country. 

Hopefully, the committee will be as 
objective as possible in naming 



candidates. We assume that in all 
professionalsim, Beering wilt be 
impartial in choosing the new chancellor 
from the selected candidates. 

His reputation is at stake. He 
promised the students, faculty and 
administrators that lU programs at 
IPFW would not suffer under Purdue's 
almost exclusive control When choosing 
a chancellor he should keep in mind that 
the person should recognize the need for 
liberal arts at IPFW as well as the 
technological programs. 

It might be interesting to note the 
make-up of the committee. It is chaired 
by the Purdue Vice-President of 
Academic Services, Donald Brown. John 
Huie, Beering's executive assistant, is 
secretary to the committee. There are 
no representatives from Indiana 
University, Bloomington, on the 
committee. There are, out of 15 
representatives from IPFW, only two 
women on the committee. Where has 
equal representation gone in these 
aspects? 

Let us hope these factors do not hinder 
the committee in finding a qualified 
candidate for the chanceUor's position. 

IPFW can't afford another misplaced 
chancellor. 



Parents should control 
children's music listening 



Last week. 22 record companies, who 
are responsible for over SO percent of the 
nation;s music agreed to feature P.G. 
warning labels on music albums which 
include lyrics referring to explicit sex, 
violence, or substance abuse. 

Carrying the label, which reads 
"Explicit Lyrics - Parental Advisor&gt;'," 
is interchangeable with printing lyrics to 
the songs on the album covers. 

Many of the adversaries of "rock 
porn" called the agreement "a victory." 
But is it? 

Yes, it's a victory for record 
companies. The public is no longer 
pestering them, and the coup — they get 
to define "explicit." 

But is it a victory for concerned 
' parents? The songs will still be played on 
the radio, the Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) controls what can 
and cannot be played on the radio, not 
the record industry And the album 
covers, another cause tor parental

alarm, are still on display in record 
stores. 

A solution, while not being a simple 
one, is to apply the rules regarding 
censorship of pornographic literature 
and film to pornographic music. 
Because the music industry cannot: 

— rate records like movies without 
astronomical costs. 

— print lyrics on albums because 
music pubhshers own the rights to the 
lyrics. 

— provide printed lyrics to radio 
stations for censorship 

— control the actions of musicians. 

— place records in brown wrappers or 
behind the counter 

— regulate videos. 

If "rock porn" is to be defeated, or at 
least controlled, then parents need to 
begin at home. Show your children you 
care. And give them, not the material, 
some P.G. - parental guidance.

Good job! 



To the Editor: 

I wanted to thank you tor 
Uie sensitivity and 
professionalism you 
displayed in writing tlie 
story "Police Arrest 
Woman" in the October 31, 
19B5 issue. Your slory was 
thorough and informative lo 
its readers, but protected the 
identity of an obviously sick 
employee. We are thankful 
that "cool heads" prevailed 
in handling this potentially 
dangerous situation. You, 
loo. are to Ire congratulated 
on your handling of the story 
which could have resulted in 
much emtiarrassment to the 
employee and her family. 

Thank you.

Upsetting article 



To (he Editor: 

After reading the article in 
the Oct- 31 issue of The 



Communicator, "Police 
Arrest Woman," [ am so 
angry I could tell the whole 
community just how IPFW 
takes care of their em- 
ployees By no means 
whatsoever should this 
article have been printed. 
How is this employee going 
(o feel when she's back in 
touch with us? 

I know the woman per- 
sonally , and 1 have a feel for 

people with problems of any 
kind If IPnV had more 
compassion instead of 
vengeance, she could have 
been helped. The fact is, 
offering Mental Health 
Servicesandstress seminars 
lo IPFW employees is 
nothing but bologna! 

This woman has been here 
for le years or more and has 
a good work record. The fact 
that she gets this kind of 
treatment is for the birds. It 
seems thai if she's not able to 
keep Ihe bathrooms or floors 
clean any longer then she's 
no longer of value lo IPFW. 

Too much stress of any 
kind brings this on. Who 
knows how she'll feel once 
the treatment has started. 
You could have at least given 
this woman the benefit of the 



doubt, not the hand of the 
police officer Instead, you 
could' ve contacted Mike 
IWiller or Peggy Jones lo try 
and bnng this under control. 
After all, you're paying Ihese 
people big bucks for nothing 
as far as I can telJ.

Greek awareness 



To the Editor: 

Having never seen 
"Animal House" or 
"Fraternity Row," my 
knowledge of sororities and 
fraternities has been based 
almost exclusively on 
conversations with memtiers 
of those organizations or 
conversations overheard 
among members I also 
recall an article in an an- 
thropology journal which 
mentioned that sororities 
and fralernibes were 
designed to segregate cer- 
tain classes of people in 
order lo define more com- 
palable marriage partners. 



were quite a revelation, 
then. Such observations 

were long overdue. They 
seri'ed lo expel notions thai 
hint at sororities and 
fraternities being socially- 
assertive only lo make 
themselves appear good in 
the eyes of the public — or on 
the pages of a newspaper. 

However, there remain 
some curiosities concerning 
the "Greeks"' that were not 
touched on. 

Why "Greeks, " for 
example? Sure they identify 
themselves with Greek 
letters, bul are Ihe qualities 



of such organizations also 
meant to reflect similar 
qualities of Greek life — past 
or present? And what do 
Greek letters signify about 
sororities and fraternities 
that cannot be conveyed in 
letters like ABC 

1 raise these questions 
because I'm sure that a 
number of people just as 
socially -conscious view the 
use of the Greek alphabet by 
university students as 
pretentious. Only with 
revealing articles like 
Jenny's will the truer image 
of the "Greeks"" be made

Frequent flyers on ^Express' can go to the *Y' 



By Mark Russell 



People Express airlines 
announces its own Irequent- 
flyer bonus plan. For every 
million miles flown on the 
cheapy airline, you get a 
round trip from New York to 
Jersey City with a free 
weekend al the "Y." 
To avoid any trouble in the 
. future, Egyptian airlines will 
'■ inaugurate a regularly 



scheduled flight from Cairo 
lo Tunisia with an in- 
termediate stop in Sicily. 

Tired of checking into a 
hotel only lo be lold that your 
room isn't ready? Try un- 
packing in the lobby. Then, 
slip into your pajamas and 
ask (he desk clerk to read 
you a story. 

Airlines continue lo lose 
and misplace luggage at an 
alarming rale. A fact of life 
is that your suitcases will 
eventually leave you. The 



more you became attached 
to Ihem, the more they will 
break your heart. 



Amazing budget 



The recently passed 
Senate budget plan is 
amazing. It requires a 
balanced budget by 1991 
without touching Social 



Security or raising taxes — 
unless there is a war or 
recession. It was someone's 
doctorate at the University 
of Oz, 

Congress is supposed lo 
cut S3G billion a year for five 
years. Whatever Congress 
can't cut, the Presidenl will. 
This will give congressmen 
more lime to pose wilh scout 
troops on the steps of the 
Capitol building. 

In grade school we learned 
that the legislative branch 



makes the laws and the 
executive enforces Ihem. 
Under this plan the 

legislative branch 
hysterically wrings its hands 



and the executive branch 
comes along and makes it all 
better.

Tri-State Folk Music Society 
embraces music from cultures 



By GARY LACY 

Staff Writer 

The Tri-SUIe Folk Music 

Sociely is defimlely on the 

TSFMS holds meetings on 
Uie first Sunday of each 
month These meetings are 
held lo encourage new 
memtiership and welcome 
various folk musicians to the 
Fort Wayne area. 

The main purpose of 
TSFMS is to get others in- 
volved in the events by 
welcoming new members 
into the world of folk music. 
The sociely is sponsoring a 
dance on November 23 at St. 
Mary's Catholic Church. 
This event will feature "old- 



lime" social dancing, tickets 
are S3 at the door. 

David Shaul. assistant 
professor of linguistics and 
anthropology here al IPFW, 
gave a folk music concert 
last Sunday at Neff Recital 
Hall The concert began with 
music from the harp that 
accompanied the Japanese 
koto on st^ge. Music from 
the British Isles was per- 
formed on the harp and the 
koto. 

Shakespearian songs were 
also part of the performance, 
Shaul sang the lyrics white 
playing the instruments. The 
Japanese koto is a stringed 
instrument that rests on the 
floor and is strummed with 
the fingers in the same style 



as a classical guitar. 

Shaul staled that he 
developed an interest for the 
Japanese koto in junior high 
school. "1 saw the koto being 
played on the Danny Kaye 
show, and developed an 
interest in it," be remarked. 
Shortly after that initial 
exposure, he purchased his 
own koto, the same one used 
for the concert, 

TSFMS puts most of its 
emphasis on getting new 
people interested in folk 
music. The society works its 
best to bring the most 
talented folk performers to 
Fort Wayne, and expand the 
folk traditions throughout 
the area
