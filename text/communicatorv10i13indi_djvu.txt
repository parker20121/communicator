WHY IS THIS RACE 
DRIVER GRINNING? 








Some say it's because he 
Save up a promising film 
career to head up the 
Budweiser Racing Team! 

But the real reason is that 
he just likes to win. And he 
did plenty of that this past 
season in a pair of 
Budweiser-sponsored, Bob 
Sharp-prepared Datsun 
race cars. 

Fifteen races: Twelve wins! 
On the pole eight times! 
Three track records! 

And in the SCCA National 
Championships at Road 
Atlanta, he took a second 
place in his C-Production 
Datsun 280-Z...and a third 
in the B-Sedan category with 
his Datsun 200-SX. 

Naturally, we congratulate 
him for his super season 
and wish him even greater 
success in 79.

We want you 



We of the Communicator are well aware that 
there is a lot of criticism of our efforts. Many of 
our readers feel that our coverage could be more 
comprehensive, that our stories could be better 
written, that our makeup — the appearance of the 
newspaper could be much better, just to enumer- 
ate some of the more frequent complaints. 

Well, we feel the same. We try to do the best 
we can, but we are short handed. In brief, we too, 
would like to see a better newspaper for IPFW, 
but we can't really do much better without your 
help. 

So the next time you find yourself criticizing the 
Communicator, think also about taking constructive 
action. If you feel you could do it better, or even 
as well, join us, and give it a try. 

We have plenty of positions open, positions for 
writers of news, feature, entertainment and opin- 
ion stories. We need photographers, copy editors, 
make-up editors. If you feel you have talent use- 
ful in any of these pursuits, let us hear from you. 

In addition, if you have the proper prerequisites, 
you may enroll in the seminar in professional 
writing and receive credit for your work on the 
newspaper and attendance in class sessions. 

Come and talk to us about it. We're in room 
215 of the Walb Memorial Union Building.
