Eighly-eighi students and volun-

Cross Blood Drive held on the IPFW 
campus Thursday Sept. 2 1 . 

"I think this year is a bigger turn 
out then last year," said Jodi Langs- 
ton. CS2 Collection Specialist. 

According to Lungslon half of the 
population is able to donate blood but 

"I think there is a great need for 
blood. People automatically assume 
that someone else will do it but if 
everyone thinks this way who will 
donate? If people would only realize 
one donation saves three lives and one 
day it could be someone they know or 
even them that need if, I believe they 
might think differently," said Langs-

F Y Ehave co-spon sored the Majors 
Fair both years, and we are incredibly 
grateful for the assistance of Kim- 
berly Wagner of FYE in planning and 
marketing this year's event," said Jill 
Parker, an academic advisor and ca- 
reer counselor. 

"Also, this year's majors fair was 
different in that we included CASA 
study skills information tables." 

Although the majors fair is only 
in its second year, it is gaining more 
attention from the university's depart- 

"Nearly all of IPFW's departments 
were represented at the majors fair. 
We had 26 departments and colleges 
present this year, and 22 last year." 
said Parker. 

The event has also experienced an 
increase student attendance. 

"We had a slight increase over 
last year's attendance of about 200 
students, and hopefully this trend can 
continue in the coming years." said 
Parker. 

The response from the students 
has been positive, as many students 
struggle with choosing a career path 
to follow. 

"Students have given feedback 
both years as to how valuable the in- 



formation is. and especially how nice 
it is to meet facully and staff in the 
dep.iriiii&lt;.iits in which lliey are either 
already majoring in or are consider- 
ing a major," said Parker. 

The majors fair also provided

Students need to remember their 
options in getting assistance when 
struggling with a possible major 
change. Many limes students tan be 
misinformed, or nut know what steps 
they need to take to move forward. 

"Sometimes, students think lliey 
have to have a particular major to go 
into a certain career, and most of the 
lime, that's not true," Parker said. 

"Speaking with a career counsel- 
or can help students determine what 
options are available to them. When 
appropriate, a career assessment can 
be given to help the student clarify 
which career areas are ol interest to 
them. Finally I'd definitely recom- 
mend the student meet with an aca- 
demic advisor," said Parker. 



Panelists Discuss 
Internet Privacy 



Recent events indicate that the 
United Slates government may be 
watching what you do while surlim.' 
the World Wide Web. In early 2006, 
the U.S. Department of Justice asked 
Google. AOL. Yahoo and Microsoft 
for records regarding Inlernel seartli 
requests. After Google refused, a 
Icdcral judge ordered compliance in 
March. Another request for 'Internet 
service providers to turn over activity 
records from the last two years came 
ai the end of June. 

Last week. IPFW's Mike Downs 
Center played host to a panel discus- 
sion focusing on internet privacy. The 
event, which was given in conjunction 
with IPFW's Ouistiiuiion.il Education 
Programming, included panelists Jim 
Cocn of OPN Systems. Todd Eigcn- 
schnick of TEK Interactive, attorney 
Jim Fenton and Glenn Morgan of 
IPFW's Information Technology Ser- 
vices. Vincc Robinson of INK News- 
papers served as monitor. 

One of the principal arguments 
surrounding ihis issue is whether 
monitoring Internet activity violates 
the rights given by the U.S. Constitu- 
tion's 4t!i amendment, which protect*

According to Szelo, if our

ihe lopic to ihe Nazis and how 
they killed off the Jews because 
they believed the Jews were not

"In my opinion, there is no

doing in America now and what 
the Nazis were doing in Ger-

trying to form a perfect race and 
we arc trying to make perfect

Szelo said he believes thai

Stereotypes a Major Flaw in America 



There is little thai hurts our soci- 
ety more than stereotypes. They start 
wars and fuel hatred. And, sadly, it is a 
phenomenon that begins so young. Let 
me tell you a little story that has helped 
lead me to this startling conclusion. 

When I was in Uie fourth grade, I 
wasn't Ihe coolest cat around (it's hard 
to believe, I know). On the barometer 
of "awesomeness", I was below freez- 
ing. 1 read Gone With the Wind — twice. 
Because of my interesting choice of 
reading material as a 9-year-old, 1 was 
subject to many a nasty ridicule. I've 
heard every one in the book (no pun in- 
tended). But it wasn't until I was beat 
up, did I make the conscious decision 
to stop reading 1024-page books on the 
playground. 

When I say "beat up", I don't mean 
having a two girls push me around and 
toss my book over my head. I mean 
a knock-down, drag-out fight. Four 
or five girls surrounded and overpow- 
ered me— not that that took too much 
(I was a tiny girl). They threw me to 
the ground and began kicking me in the 
stomach. They spit and cursed at me. 
10- and 11-year-olds! All because I 
was an avid reader. Imagine what they 
would" ve done had they known then 
that I was gay! 

Why is it so bad to be different? 
Why do people have to instantly as- 



sume that anyone unlike us is wrong or 
bad? Why do we have to label them? 
Why can't we just sit back and marvel 
in our diversity? There is so much to 
learn in this world; and so many differ- 
ent people available to teach us. Why 
are we so deaf and blind to each other? 

Usually, I can try to explain away 
why we, as humans, do the things we 
do. This time isn't like that, though. I 
can 't, for the life of me, figure 
it became accepted and ever 
aged to hate others. 

I come from an incredibly diverse 
family. My father is the oldest of 25 
children. (Yes, you read me correctly.) 
My grandparents had four biological 
kids and then adopted 21 others. They 
took in sibling sets, older kids, kids with 
disabilities, kids that were subjected to 
some of the most gut-wrenching abuse. 
i literally had no concept of racial dif- 
ferences, physical limitations, or any- 
thing else until I was 10 and someone 
brought it to my attention that my 
was different from me. 

All that said, though, I'm not going 
to sit on some journalistic high-horse 
and pretend I don't do the very thing 
I'm so vehemently denouncing now. 
As much as it shames me to admit, I've 
done it. I think it's safe to assume ev- 
eryone has. Now, though, that we can 
recognize this ire me minus ll.iw we ■..:&gt;.;&lt; 
work on making it disappear. Think of 
the world we could create for ourselves, 
our children, and our children's chil- 
dren if we eradicated hate. It would be 
beautiful.

WAR IN IRAQ HAS America Obsessed About Weight 



GONE ON TOO LONG 



By Stephanie Sample: 



I used to be 100% for the war in 
Iraq, but my emotions on the subject 
have slowly changed. Although I was 
initially supportive of our war efforts, 
I am now becoming more cynical and 
feel that the situation needs to be care- 
fully reconsidered. I find the time that 
all the troops have been and are cur- 
rently putting into ihe war to be amaz- 
ing, but I think it is time for them to 

out the soldiers and their 
icn was the last time a 
ither serving our country 
to hold his/her daughter 
r family' 1 1 think the war 
long enough. Even though 
i pride may be at risk, our 
country should send all of our troops 
home. Would it be best for our troops 
and this country? I cannot say I know 



Think a 
families. V 
father or n 






the whole story behind the war, but I 
think that America has enough prob- 
lems here on which to focus. 

Is it really worth all the money we 
are putting towards the war or would 
the funds be better spent dealing with 
other issues such as welfare and social 
security? People can be for or against 
this war, but I think most have that 
"when is ilus going to end?" feeling, I 
believe Americans need to look at the 
situation from the perspective of the 
people whose lives jre being affected 
For example, a high school friend of 
mine has a husband currently serving 
overseas. This friend, with the help of 
family and friends, is raising a 15 year 
old daughter and the highlight of her 
day is getting a call from her husband. 
Try to imagine the war in Iraq from 
her point of view and from others in 
similar situations. Then ask yourself: 
Is there really a need for this war? I 
think the answer would be no. 



Every channel on television has 
someone telling us the best new way 
to lose weight. Everyone from celebri- 
ties to average joes are being put on 
television while having their weighi 
loss documented. I hate to admit it, — 
bui I have been a sucker for some 
of these shows. These programs, 
from "Celebrity Fit Club" to "The 
Biggest Loser", have taken away 
nrcious lime nf my life. Even talk 
shows obsess over the topic, and _ 
each show claims to have the fail- 
proof way to lose weight. 

While watching one of these shows. 
I started thinking "no wonder we are 
obsessed." 

Everyone always talks about how 
thin models and actors affect the pub- 
lic, but it is beyond that. Every person 
on these shows goes in talk ins.' abmii 
how miserable they are. They all 



don't date, and thai people are mean to 

Then, the after picture completely 
changes them. All of the sudden, the 
one-time hermits have full social 
schedules and have never been hap- 

it feeling belter about 



'Everyone always talks about 

how thin models and actors 

affect the public, but it is 

beyond that." 

your body can change other aspects of 
your life, but it does not change every- 
thing. So back to my point - no won- 
der we are obsessed. Every show tells 
us "if you lose those 20 pounds, every- 
thing will change." but thai message is 



suits are permanent. 1 think people in 
college, especially females, are a main 
target for these fads. Between classes, 
exams, and extracurricular activities, 
college siudenis don't have time to 
plan out a healthy meal and work oui 
for three hours a day. 

If we can drink u meal in a can and 
lose 10 pounds in ten days, we will go 
_ for it. I wouldn't describe myself or 
any of my friends as patient. 

I will admit that I have been a 
victim of some trends, but 1 encour- 
age everyone not to be victims. Lei 
us remember that the fads aren't re- 
ally needed. Our grandparents didn't 
have the fad diets of today, and not 
all of them were fat. 

Why is a concept of eating less and 
exercising more so hard to grasp? I 
urge everyone who may be trying 10 get 
rid of their Ic-fl over freshmen 15 to be 
careful. Remember that being healthy 
is important, but being ihe skinniest 
person in the room will not always 
make you the happiest.

Campus Lost and Found a Treasure Chest 



By Louisa Danielson

The other day, I wenl

cover - and instead. I Inurid a treasure

Quality and 
Intelligence 
are Not 
Illusions 

By Mike Webb 



Movies claiming lo capti- 
vate and mesmerize audiences 
seem to be commonplace these 
days, but how many of them 
actually follow through on such 
promises? 

Having a proven aclor such 
as Edward Norton in the lead 
role can lend credence to such 
claims. So it was with high 
expectations that I went lo see 
"The Illusionist", fully expect- 
ing to be entertained. Even with 
such high expectations, I was 
not let down. 

Taking place in 1 9th cen- 
tury Vienna. "The Illusionist" 
(directed by Neil Burger) is the 
story of a young magician. As 
a youth, he befriends Sophie, 
the Duchess of Vienna. Their 
friendship is forbidden due to 
differing social classes; how- 
ever, they persevere and form a 
strong bond. When their secret 
friendship is discovered and 
severed, Eisenheim sets out on a 
pilgrimage to hone his ability as 
an illusionist. 

Returning 15 years later, he 
finds Vienna under the rule of 
Crown Prince Leopold, a young 
ruler with less than noble inten- 
tions towards both his country 
and Sophie, and Chief Inspec- 
tor Uhl, the Prince's right hand 
man with an affinity for amateur 

Eisenheim attains wealth 
and celebrity for himself in 
town as a result of his illusions, 
which defy logic itself. His tal- 
ents gamer the attention of the 
most prominent citizens in town, 
eventually reuniting him with 
Sophie and giving Chief Inspec- 
tor Uhl, the Prince's watchman, 
cause for investigation. And so 
the plot thickens. 

Edward Norton shines as 
Eisenheim, a very quiet and 
mysterious character. He is rigid 
and serious. The coldness he 
emanates in this role adds to the 
viewer's intrigue as it pertains 
to the illusions themselves. Is 
Eisenheim really creating illu- 
sions, or is he somehow using 
real magic? I felt as if I were a 
guest at one of his shows try- 
ing to figure out how these 
feats could possibly be accom- 
plished. 

As Chief Inspector Uhl, 
Paul Giamatti shows the same 
maturity which garnered him 
so much praise in Sideways. 
Much like that role, he plays 
a man who is good at what he 
does, but seemingly unsatisfied 
with the hand life has dealt him. 
The mental conflict he faces as 
he attempts to decide where he 
stands between a shady illusion- 
ist and a corrupt leader becomes 
one of the movie's most inter- 
esting plot lines. 

Rounding out the cast is Jes- 
sica Biel as the overprotected 
Sophie and Rufus Sewell as 
the corrupt prince. Both deliver 
more than adequate (even if a 
little stiff) performances, with 
Sewell in particular seeming to 
truly relish in his character's 
corrupt desires. 

Aesthetically, the cinema- 
tog raphe rs succeeded in making 
the movie look seemingly aged, 
with a washed out color tone and 
often blurry 



,t of an old n 






worth mentioning is the sound 
track (composed by Philip Glass 
of "The Hours" fame), which el- 
egantly adds to the suspense of 
this relatively dark movie. 

Fans of M. Night Shyamalan 
will feel at home with the twists 
and turns in "The Illusionist". 
Though not confusing, this film 
will keep you guessing while 
trying to figure out what is real 
as the story unfolds. If you enjoy 
well thought out movies without 
gratuitous explosions and other 
Hollywood flair, then do your- 
self a favor and see this film. 



Breaking Benjamin Breaks into Mainstream 



Since the 2002 release of 
their debut album "Saturate", 
Breaking Benjamin has been 
slowly picking up steam in an 
attempt to break through lo big- 
ger and better things. 

In 2004, the band released 
"We Are Not Alone", which 
contained the hit "So Cold" and 
reached platinum status. Now, 
in 2006, we see the band releas- 



ing their latest effort "Phobia" 
to an already established fan 
base, Luckily for us (the listen- 
ers), "Phobia" is their most am- 
bitious, musically-diverse, and 
fastest selling album to date. 

The first Buck on this record 
is a subtle and dark introduction 
which builds anticipation and 
leads into the hit song "The Di- 
ary of Jane". 

This type of polish and care 
is put into all eleven of the 
full-length songs on "Phobia," 



which displays a certain maturi- 
ty that simply hasn't been pres- 
ent to this degree before. 

The rest of the songs on 
"Phobia" are similar in nature 
to "The Diary of Jane," mean- 
ing that this album is loaded 
with emotional lyrics layered on 
lop of heavy, mid-tempo rock 

The only exception is "Here 
We Are," which is much softer 
than the rest of album and serves 
to break up some of the heavi- 



ness. Most of the songs on "Pho- 
bia" carry a similar tone; how- 
ever, that similarity only serves 
to make the album flow better 
from song to song, and furthers 
ihe evolution of the Breaking 
Benjamin sound. 

It is almost as though the 
Breaking Benjamin's two pre- 
vious efforts were an attempt 
to figure out who ihey were as 
a band. Now, they arc comfort- 
able enough lo express the re- 
sults of their experimentation. 



With new drummer Chad S2eli- 
ga on board, this band has never 
sounded better from a technical 
standpoint. 

Wilh "Phobia", Breaking 
Benjamin has kept the heavi- 
ness which defines their genre 
and crafted true songs around 
it, These songs may not be deep 
or overly-complex in nature, but 
they are fresh, valid, and musi- 
cally-impressive in comparison 
to many of their contempo-

Same Old 
Story, 
Just a 
New Year 

From The Bleachers 

By Anthony Maurer 



Yes, the women's volley- 
ball team has lost more mutches 
halfway through the season this 
year than it did in all of 2005. 

Yes, they started off 0-4 af- 
ter the Ball State Nike/Active 
Ankle Weekend. 

Also, their most touted play- 
er in 2000s Brazilian sensation 
Fabiana Souza, is now off the 
court and doing graduate work. 

They are still as good of a 









here's why. 

The first thing that should 
be discussed is their dismal 
zero-for-four tournament start 
at the beginning of the season. 
It should probably be mentioned 
that they played against Michi- 
gan, Ball State, Xavier and 
Western Michigan. 

Last year they kicked off the 
season against the University 
of Miami, Temple, Hofstra and 
Chicago State. Nothing against 
the teams who participated in 
last years Hofstra/Asics Invi- 
tational, but the lineup at Ball 
Stale this year was a lot more 
competitive all the way around. 

Michigan, as of this week- 
end, was 1 3-2 overall and ranked 
#19 prior to their five game loss 
against tt 11 Purdue. 

Ball Slate (3-10), the most 
likely team for IPFW to have 
defeated, played a good match 
against the Mastodons and capi- 
talized on a run in the fourth

Women's Volleyball WeeksMI Perfect 

■ The IPFW women's volleyball team goes 4-0 to sweep their own invitational over the weekend 



eft 



By Anthony Maurer 



The IPFW women's vol- 
leyball team was perfect in four 
games during the weekend invi- 
tational. 

The weekend turned into 
a series of routs for the Mast- 
odons, as they defeated every 
team in three straight games. 

Performing admirably 

for the Mastodons, Rebekah 
Roehm and Peachy Jankowski 
were named to the All-Touma- 

IPFW started their run 
with a stomping of the Texas 
Pan American Broncs in three 
straight games. 

Scoring was widespread for 
IPFW, with sophomore Jessica 
Miller being the only Mastodon 
in the double-digit kill column 
with ten. 

Senior Fort Wayne South 
Side alum Claire Jackson also 
pitched in five block solos and 
six block assists with her eight 
kills in the match. Nicole How- 
ell was sharp at the serve, rack- 
ing up four aces. She also con- 
tributed (o the defensive effort 
with 10 digs. 

Junior Peachy Jankowski 
led the Mastodons defense in 
typical fashion, posting 1 1 digs. 

Jankowski totaled 63 digs 
on the weekend. The match 
against the stumbling Broncs 
would prove to be a very one 
-sided affair, with Texas Pan 
American only coming within 
three points of IPFW in the first 
of their three games 27-30. The 
remaining two games were 30- 
15 and 30-22 in favor of the" 
Mastodons. 

Cynara" Ma'ams* led the 
Mastodons to their second win 
over South Dakota State with 
twelve kills, eleven digs and I 
block assist. 

Freshman Jamie Schwartz 
was second in digs with ten. 
Howell and Jankowski each 
pitched in eight digs, with How- 
ell also making a contribution 
on offense with seven kills. 

Roehm put up one of the 
performances that earned her 
a spot on the All-Tournament 
team, posting nine kills and 
three blocks against the Jack- 



rabbits. 

South Dakota State didn't 
fair well against the Mastodons, 
losing the first game 18-30. 
The next two games would see 
a harder fought battle from the 
Jackrabbils, but each would end 
up short. 26-30 and 23-30. 

Day two of the Invita- 
tional was u rematch between 
IPFW and the Robert Morris 
Colonials, who the Mastodons 
defeated at the Omni William 
Penn/Duquesne RMU Invita- 
tional in three straight games. 
The rematch would play out 
much like the original match 
up, with IPFW walking away a 
perfect 3-0. 

Senior outside hitter led the 
Mastodons with twelve kills and 
seven digs, Martins and Roehm 
each pitched in eight kills and 






digs 



Roehm added four block i 
in the match. 

Perhaps the best match sta- 
tistically for the Mastodons was 
their three-game finale against 
the North Florida Ospreys. 

The Mastodons won a re- 
sounding victory, with scores 
of 30-17. 30-26 and 30-18 -the 
largest margin of victory in their 

Pfister and Martins each 
put up a double-double perfor- 
mance. Martins chalked up fif- 
teen kills and eleven digs, and 
Pfister posted 12 kills and 10 
diys respectively. 

Roehm would add seven 
kills and three aces in the three 
game stampede over North 
Florida. Jankowski would add 
another 27 digs in the contest. 
- The wins pull IPFW well 
over the .500 mark, giving them 
a 13-8 record with twelve more 
matches ahead before the Inde- 
pendent Tournament. Their next 
match is at Eastern Michigan on 
Tuesday, October 3. The Mast- 
odons are currently riding a four 
match winning streak going into 
their off week. They took to 
keep the momentum up against 
Eastern Michigan next week. 

The Eagles are currently 5- 
7 overall, and have yet to win a 
match at the friendly confines of 
their Convocation Center this 
season (0-2).

The Broncos of Western 
Michigan are 11-5 after this 

losses coming against ranked 
opponents. 

Comparing that to last 
year's opponents, Miami (4-11) 
or Temple (5-6). it's easy to sec 
that this year has a harder sched- 
ule in line for the Mastodons. 

Not to downplay last year's 
schedule, where IPFW went up 
against #7 ranked Florida at the 
swamp, but a look at this year's 
opponents will show stron- 
ger overall competition for the 
Mastodons. 

Also, IPFW returns a lot of 
experience left over from last 
year's 24-6 squad. 

Seniors Amanda Pfister, 
Nicole Howell and Claire Jack- 
son arc all making big plays for 
IPFW in their final campaign 
donning blue and white. 

Jackson recently made 
IPFW history by setting a new 
career block assist record, and 
looks to possibly top 350 blocks 
by the end of this season. 

Pfister spiked down 400 
kills in her first three seasons at 
IPFW. with 200 of which com- 
iiiu jusi IjsI year. 

She has added 185 so far in 
Lhe 2006 season and counting. 

Howell has 94 kills and 124 
digs to add to her already im- 

egories. with each totaling more 
than 650 going into this season. 

The three seniors arc sup- 
ported by Cynara Martins, a key 
acquisition from the Belo-Hori- 
Zante pipeline three years ago. 

Martins has posted solid 
number this season, with 513 
kills and 668 digs after 21 
matches. You also have Peachy 
Jankowski in her third season at 



Behind the upper classmen. 



Sophomore Jessica Domin- 
lak has made many contribu- 
tions this year, including her 
749 set assists so far in 2006. 

Jessica Miller has added 
162 kills. 4 block solos and 50 
block assists to the statistics this 
year. Kylee Hervey and Chris- 
tine Simon have contributed 
tor lhe Mastodons, playing in a 
combined 26 games so far this 

You can't forget about the 
coaching. 

Head coach Kelly Hartley- 
Hution has had an impressive 
146-73 (.666) record while at 
IPFW and a career record of 
293-140 1677) over a 12 year 

In short, she has won two of 
every three matches in her ten- 
ure as a coach. That's the kind 
of leadership a winning pro- 
gram has to appreciate, and I'm 
sure IPFW does. 

There's one thing I can 
almost guarantee: as long as 
Couch Hartley is at the helm of 
the program, you will
