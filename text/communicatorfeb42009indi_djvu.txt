Same Brown River, Cleaner Water 




By Kelly McLendon 

kelly.nirlcndDTieipfwcDnununicalar.otg 



As MayorTom Henry walked to the podium at 
the Community Forum on Infrastructure Invest- 
ments to Improve Fort Wayne Water Quality on 
Wednesday January 28, the crowd fell silent. 

Henry began his speech stating tlie cliche 
phrase, "out of sight, out of mind." He explained 
that water lines and sewer lines, two typically 
overlooked parts of the infrastructure, are again 
in need of repair. As Henry announced, "these 
aging pipes dump raw sewage into our rivers," 
the audience listened intendy. 

There were all types of concerned citizens at 
the meeting— from a middle-aged woman knit- 
ting what appeared to be a blanket while pseudo- 
listening, to several men with their clipboards, 
WTiting notes and nodding their heads. 

"Our current system really has treated us well 
over the past 100 years." Henry said. "More than 
100 years ago, Fort Wayne built its first sewer 
system to carr^' stormwater away from streets, 
homes and businesses. When indoor plumbing 
came later, sewage lines from homes and busi- 
nesses were hooked to these same sewers, com- 
bining stormwater and sewage in one pipe and 
sending it directly to our rivers and streams." 

Combining the sewers was the best technol- 
og&gt;' available at the time, but that was before 
sanitation treatment. 

In current times, when sanitation is para- 
mount. Investing in the sewer system to reduce 
overflow is prime. "Fort Wayne's combined sew- 
er system overflows about 71 times in an average 
year, releasing more than 1 billion gallons of raw 
- sewage mixed with stormwater into our water- 
ways," according to The Fort Wayne City Utili- 
ties Executive Summarj' book. 

It's important, especially when you know 
that "local waterways exceed state water qual- 
ity standards for E. Coli bacteria about 85 days 



per year on average — generally during or after 
wet weather events." according to the summary 
book. 

Henry, wearing a jovial checkered sweater, 
ended his welcome introduction by urging the 
community to "stay focused on the future." 

The audience was then shown a 20 minute 
clip from the film. Liquid Assets, which informs 
about the disastrous issues of sewage in the 
water system. The movie in its entirety will be 
showm on February 12 at 8 PM and also on Feb- 
ruary 22 at 1 PM on PBS-39. 

The film was informative and moderately 
frightening from several perspectives. Liquid As- 
sets affirmed that modern civilization would be 
impossible without water and that it is "a com- 
modity" that each person uses a whopping 100 
gallons of every single day. The film was not a 
superfluous outdated picture they would show 
in high school. It was instead an up to date re- 
flection of today's water crisis. 

In the movie, the Mayor of Adanta made the 
horrilying statement that, "if we don't protect 
water, we will be without water." Such a state- 
ment is the primary reasoning why it may be 
important to work on renovating the sewer in- 
ft-astructure now. 



"If we don't protect water, we 
will be without water." 



The Environmental, Protection Agency has 
required the City to update the infrastructures, 
or face harsh penalties. 

Renovation won't be cheap, however. For Fort 
Wayne to comply v/ith EPA water quality man- 
dates, it will cost about S240 million dollars. 

The EPA asserts that diis cost, "remain (s) af- 
fordable for the communit&gt;'." Also, there will be 



sewer rate increases, because the city's "annual 
costs for its wastewater system are expected to 
grow nearly 10.5 percent per year between 2008 
and 2014." according to the City Utilities sum- 
mary book. 

After the movie, audience members were able 
to ask questions to a 10 member panel, ranging 
from members of the Fort Wayne Clean Riv- 
ers Task Force, to workers from Fort Wayne City 
Utilities. 

Kumar Menon, Director of Fort Wayne City 
Utilities stressed the point that improving the 
sewer system will bring unforeseen positives. 
"We have an opportunity to create a stronger 
economy." Menon said. Updating the current 
system will bring many construction jobs to the 
area. 

He also stated that carrying out the changes, 
although costly, will provide a "cleaner future for 
us. our children and our grandchildren." 

The recreational use of the rivers in Fort 
Wayne was also discussed by the panel mem- 
bers. Dan Wire, panelist and member of The 
Clean Rivers Task Force said, "you can boat on 
them, you can canoe," but cautioned, "don't eat 
fish out of them, don'l swim in them." 

Dr. Larry Wiedman, Chair of Environmental 
Science at University' of St. Francis agreed vrith 
Wire's statement and also said with the new pro- 
posed sewer system changes, the odor of the 
river will be diminished. 

Wire was quick to add that, "the color of the 
water won't change, but the quality will." There- 
fore, the water will be cleaner, but the commu- 
nity won't be able to tell, because it vriU be still 
be brown. 

The City will continue to report on the prog- 
ress of this project to the public. It has a project 
completion date of 2025, which is the time pe- 
riod that the EPA has given for when they want it 
completed by.

IPSGA elections for 2009-2010 school year kickirig off 




The excitement 
from the 2008 
elections is 
simmering down, but 
at IPFW another tj-pe of 
election enthusiasm is 
just getting started. Be- 
ginning this Friday peti- 
tions will be available to 
get names on the ballot 



Student Body 
Presidential Address 



for the IPSGA elections. 
The positions of President, 
Vice President of Legisla- 
tion, Vice President of Fi- 
nance, and Vice President 
of Programming will be 
up for grabs when voting 
takes place in April. 

The officers serve one 
year terms starting in May. 
More detailed descrip- 
tions of each position can 
be found in our Consti- 
tution or by simply talk- 
ing to the current officers 
about what they do. 



If you are interested 
in running for one of 
these positions stop by 
the IPSGA office in Walb 
Union 225 and pick up a 
petition. Potential can- 
didates must get the sig- 
natures of at least one 
percent of current IPFW 
students and must also 
meet certain other re- 
quirements outlined in 
the IPSGA Constitution 
in order to become an of- 
ficial candidate. 

Previous involvement 



in student government is 
not required but certain- 
ly does help out. 

More details on the 
election procedures can 
be directed to Hagi Brad- 
ley, the Student Govern- 
ment Coordinator and 
the Election Board. 

Participating in stu- 
dent government is a 
great chance to give 
something back to the 
campus and work to- 
wards changes you feel 
should be made. This 



year I am hoping IPFW 
will set new records for 
both the number of can- 
didates running and the 
number of students who 
come out to vote. Active 
participation is vital to 
any government, even at 
the campus level. 

Also, 1 am requesmg 
that all who submit- 
ted logo designs for our 
contest please re-submit 
them via email. Feel free 
to contact me for more 
details on why. 



Allen County economy unable to 
sustain college graduates op-ed

malls, a different store going out of business every 
week, and homes being foreclosed upon. 

This begs the question: does Allen Countj; or In- 
diana in general, offer a suitable economic environ- 
ment for college graduates to seide and thrive? 

■ It is no secret that Indiana's economy has been 
struggling over the past few years. Indiana, nick- 
named 'The Crossroads of^America," is a slate that 
has an economy heavily based in manufacturing, 
especially in the automobile and railroad industry. 

Today, these industrial jobs, especially in the au- 
tomotive industry, are quickly vanishing. 

According to Indiana Department of Workforce 
Development, unemployment in Fort Wayne has 
increased significanily, rising From 4.7 percent in 
2007 to 8.1 percent in Dec. 2008. 

Northeast Indiana has the second worst unem- 
ployment of the six regions in Indiana, as it saw its 
unemployment rate jump from 4.9 percent in 2007 
to 9.5 percent in Dec. 2008. 

The U.S. presendy has an unemployment rate of 
7.2 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor 
Statisdcs. This illustrates that Indiana is struggling 
more than the average U.S. state. 

When people with experience in a particular field 
lose their jobs, there is less hope that a diiferent em- 
ployer will be more willing to hire an applicant fresh 
out of college with litde to no experience. Instead, 
this employer is more likely to hire an applicant 
who recently lost his job, is more willing lo be paid a 
smaller salary, and has had experience in the field. 



Andy Hoover is a current student at IPFW who re- 
lumed to school to earn a degree in accounting after 
graduating ivith a bachelors in general studies. He 
has witnessed the hardships college graduates face 
when trying to find a job in Allen County. 

"College graduates cannot find good jobs in Allen 
County." Hoover said, "If you're not willing to leave 
FortWayne. you're in for some bad luck." 

Hoover recalls hearing of one thousand people who 
applied for a desk jockey job at the new Holiday Inn 
in Fort Wayne. Many of these were young people, 
one of which was an acquaintance of Hoover. This 
person was a Purdue graduate that had earned good 
grades and had experience in her field of study, but 
was still unable to find work after she had gradu- 
ated. 

With an employment rate nearly doubling in a city 
that was built of railroads and car manufacturing, 
industries which scarcely exist these days, does the 
Allen County economy have enough employment 
positions to sustain new college graduates? 

With massive amounts of talent, college debt, and 
an increasingly competitive job market, the best op- 
tion is to perhaps seek job opportunities elsewhere. 
There are many lists available that compile the 
best cities for recent college graduates. 

According to Forbes.com, the three best cities are 
Austin, Houston, and Dallas, all of which are located 
in Texas. Other cities include Denver, Washington, 
D.C, Atianta, Raleigh, and Sealde.

On Jan. 29, President 
Barack Obama made the 
first legislative act of his 
presidency by signing 
the Lilly Ledbetler Fair 
Pay Act. This legislation 
is intended to "fight pay 
discrimination and en- 
sure fundamental fair- 
ness to American work- 
ers," according to www. 
whilehouse.gov. 

This legislation 

stems from Ledbetter v, 
Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber 
Company In this case, 
Lilly l.edbeiler sued her 
employer for pay dis- 
crimination, as her male 
counterparts had earned 
significandy higher sala- 
ries than she did over 



Day 9: Obama makes first 
legislative act of presidency 



the two decades she had 
been working. 

According to the 
Washington Post, the 
Supreme Court held that 
"discriminatory intent 
must occur during the 
180-day charging pe- 
riod. Ledbetter claimed 
that Goodyear acted with 
discriminatory intent in 
the charging period -by 
issuing the checks, nor 
by denying her a raise in 
1998." 

Nearly two years after 
this case, Obama signed 
the Lilly Ledbetter Fair 
PayAct to cancel the 180- 
day charging period and 
to make it easier for em- 
ployees to sue employers 
for discrimination. 

"Lilly Ledbetter did 
not set out to be a trail- 
blazer or a household 
name," Obama said be- 
fore he signed the act. 



"She was just a good 
hard worker who did her 
job - and she did it well 
- for nearly t\vo decades 
before discovering,. , she 
was paid less than her 
mate colleagues for do- 
ing die very same work." 
It is estimated that Led- 
betler was cut out of over 
$200,000 during the pe- 
riod she was employed 
by Goodyear 

This law has not been 
met without criticism, 
as some are upset by the 
retroactive nature of tliis 
legislation. A projected 
scenerio that businesses 
become more reluctant 
to hire women and mi- 
nority groups. 

However, many agree 
that this legislation will 
gready benefit labor 
groups, women, and mi- 
norities across the coun- 
try.

Top 10 reasons that 
Fort Wayne is the best city to live in: 

10. It's a fort so you know we'll always be well protected. 

9. Sufe in Tempe, Arizona it is probably 74 degrees as you read this, but here you can make snow 
angels while you wail for someone lo pick you up because your cat won't start when it's below 



8. Name one other city with THREE rivers, I date you. 

7. It's a short drii/e from Canada for when you need lo flee the country! 

6. The library has the second largest genealogy collection in America for when you want to 
research your long family history of being born, getting married, having kids and then dying. 

5. Everywhere you go in downtown it smells like ftesh baked bread. Seriously, Fort Wayne smells 
great I 

1. You're here, and you make this little town very special, because you're awesome. Pat yourself 

on the back, wonderiul you. No really, pat yourself on the back, just do it when nobody is 

looking so you won't look dumb. 

3. It's more exciiing than Decatur, Churubusco, and Crabill COMBINEtl, 

2. There's nothing like bragging to your out-of-town friends that you live in the same city that 
Shelly Long lived in. 

1 , There are no bettei places to enjoy some fine cultural experiences that at venues such as the 
ait museum and the Civic Theatre.

The Daily Gamecock - U. of South Carolina 

U.S. Olympic champion Michael 
Phelps apologized for his behavior 
after a photo of him inhaling from a 
marijuana pipe during a house party 
in Columbia surfaced Sunday. 

The photo, which was published 
by the British tabloid News of the 
World, was reportedly taken when 
Phelps\nsited Columbia in November, 
during which time he received a 
standing ovation from the crowd 
during a University of SouUi Carolina 
football game. 

One of Phelps's agents released a 
statement in which Phelps apologized 
for his actions, 

"I engaged in beha\'ior which was 
regrettable and demonstrated bod 
judgment," Phelps said. "I'm 23 years 
old and despite the successes I've had 
in the pool, I acted in a youthful and 
inappropriate way, not in a manner 
people have come to expect from 
me. For this, I am sorry. I promise my 
fans and the public it will not happen 
again." 

The publication did not actually 



allege thui Phelps smoki'd pni ,ind 
Phclpsdid no t dispute the aiitheiuicity 
of the picture. 

Student Body President Andrew 
Gaeckle said he knows Phelps has 
been in trouble before, such as his 
DUl in 2004. and he said "as a public 
figure, I wish he'd act as though he 
has some responsibilities to uphold. " 

However, Gaeckle said he knows 
individuals are in charge of their own 
actions. 

"At die same time, individuals are 
who they are. He does activities at 
his own risk and if that's something 
he's OK with that is his choice," 
said the fourth-year international 
studies student. "However, smoking 
marijuana is illegal and in that sense 
it's right he got caught. 

Meg Chieffe, a third-year 
accounting student, said she thinks 
the attention directed at the incident 
is deserved. 

"He's supposed lo be a role model 
for kids," she said. "Stuff like this 
always gets blown up." 

David Howman, the World And- 
D oping Agency executive diiector, 
said an athlete can only be punished 
if a positive test occurs during 
competition.

Club Seoul, the Korean culture group on 
campus, was complelely surprised to re- 
ceive a prestigious award from the Korea 
Foundation recently. The group was awarded a 
grant of $2,000, as well as a collection of Korean 
films in order to pursue plans for a Korean Film 
Festival. The event is going on now, until Febru- 
ary 19. 

"At firsi, we were not sure if we would be select- 
ed to receive this grant, as the list of schools who 
received it in die past were I\7 League schools. So 
it was a surprise that we were selected to do Ihis." 
AlexanderMann, president of Club Seoul, said. 

The film fesdval will feature a plethora of films, 
ranging from traditional to modern. "They're not 
Hong Kong action films, though one may see 
such an influence in Oldboy. And movies like ISA 
may strike some students as German in style." 



said Mann. Films this week include a documentary, 
"Hanbok" showing from 2-5 p.m. on February 4 in 

Walb G21 and "King and the Cloivn" on February 5 
from 7:30-10 p.m. in SB 168. There will be pizza at 
botli screenings. 

Movie-goers to the festival can expect to expe- 
rience a cultural awakening, as well as fun discus- 
sion and camaraderie. "These films are an art form. 
These films really are fun to watch and present deep 
thought-provoking topics, but a few are also funny, 
and at the same time they push us to mentally slep 
outside ourselves for a few hours." Vice president of 
Club Seoul, Sybil McCartol said. 

"We are sure that anyone who comes to see our 
film festival w\\] see why they IKorean filmsl have 
gained popularity over the years." Mann said. 
Don't feel like you can't attend the film festival be- 
cause you don't know anything about Korean cul- 
ture, either. 

"Before each film. Club Seoul will present short 
lectures to help viewers better understand topics 
presented in each film. As McCanol noted, "We 
want to encourage people to come in out of the 
cold and come see some of these great films!" 





ART 



AND THE 



CITY 

You Don't Always Have to Pay for Art 



By Kelly McLendon

- "Art and The City" will, be a continuing series 
about art events in Fort Wayne. E-mail your event 
to kelly.niclendon@ipfwcommunicator.org. 




Art is free. Just look 
around the city. You don't 
need to pay exorbitant 
fees to go to the Louvre 
and see paintings. Sure, 
that would be exciting 
and exhilarating; but, if 
your budget is a little less 
affluent, there are many 
ways 10 see some good 
art and not spend a single 
dollar. 

The Fort Wayne Mu- 
seum of Art offers fVee ad- 



mission on the first Sun- 
day of the month, every 
Wednesday, and Thurs- 
days 5 to 9p.m. The gallery 
currently offers a few no- 
table exhibitions. I am A 
Man: Photographs by Er- 
nest C. Withers is featured 
until April 26, along with 
lohn Buck: Iconography. 
All of the different exhib- 
its and showcases at the 
FWMA offer something 
for every person, discern- 



ing or indiscriminate. 

Another place to 
check out free work is at 
ArtLink. You know the 
coolest part about going 
to the galleries around 
town is attending die 
opening night receptions. 
You'll get to mingle with 
people, maybe even fa- 
mous and prominent, in 
the art community and 
also enjoy the first-night 
festivities. 



The ArtLink gallery is 
located by the Cinema 
Center doivntown and 
while it features a rather 
small gallery space, it 
showcases some of the 
city's best talent. Right 
now, the Main Gallery 
features the work of E4, 
which is impressive and 
sometimes odd, in a good 
way. 

The downtown library 
also has an an gallery, 
believe it or not. The en- 



trance to die Jeffrey R. 
Krull Gallery is right by 
the main West entrance 
of the library and is cur- 
rently showcasing The 
Spirit of Budo, which is 
about Japanese mardal 
artistry. 

While the well-known 
galleries are great, check- 
ing out small, secluded 
shops might also be 
worth your time. Check 
out www.artists.acpl.info 
to find featured artists in 



the area. 

The next event you 
should plan to attend is 
the opening reception for 
Art Off Main, which takes 
place this Friday, Febru- 
ary 6 from 6 to 9p.m. at 
The Masonic Temple, 216 
East Washington Blvd. 
Downtown. There ivill be 
a fashion show at 7:30 p.m. 
as well as a cash bar and a 
live 97.3 WMEE broadcast. 
This event has an admis- 
sion fee of $5; however.

'Notorious' explores multiple 
genres in film about a rapper 



By DevJn Middleton 

dpvin.middlelonS' 

Notorious is tlie biography about 
ttie late CJi ris to pher Wallace, a.k.a. No- 
torious B.I.G., Biggie Smalls, Big Poppa 
elc) Although it is a biopic about a rap- 
per, this isn't another Get Rich Or Die 
Ttying type of movie. 

Years from now, it'll be remembered 
as the other movie where the rapper got 
shot, and in this one he died. All jokes 
aside, il really was a good movie. They 
do a great job at making you really like 
him. then really hate him, and then re- 
ally liking him 

They present his beginning, his 
journey, and of course his death. In 
actuality, it somehow becomes an ac- 
don, drama, and comedy with an ur- 
ban tivisl on it. In real life, authorities 



still haven't found the killer. A sequel 
maybe? Although the actor and rapper 
lamal Woolard (a.k.a. Gravy) did a great 
job playing the deceased superstar. It's 
my opinion that Derek Luke who played 
Sean Combs (a.k.a. Puff Daddy, R Did- 
dy, Diddy elc.) had the best roll. I've 
seen him in Biker Boyz and Antwone 
Fisher, but there was nothing more 
epic than watching a groivn man do a 
flashier version of the chicken dance to 
late 90s rap music. As a Bad Boy music 
fan myself, i think the actors did the 
parts justice. The story was informative 
and left you hanging. I laughed, I cried, 
I wrote about it.

of how Tara's husband deals widi the 
circumstances as well as the commu-

tion and her sister's refusal to acknowl- 
edge her condition. 

Part of Cody's ability to normalize 
such taboo subjects stems from her 
protagonists. Both Ellen Page and Toni

a self-deprecating and honest sense of 
humor, which makes their abnormali-

main characters, 
thesecond episode 
did little to build on their complexity. 

To keep its viewers entertained, 
UST must dig deep and Oesh out ail 
of its characters — and refrain from a 
singular focus on Tara's alter egos. For 
example, Aunt Charmaine is obviously 
in denial over her sister's diagnosis, but 
little has been revealed as towhy'she" 
finds it so disturbing. 

With such acclaimed talent on 
board (Steven Spielberg is the execu- 
tive producer), UST has all the makings 
of an award-winning and highly rated 
series. Wliether it will reach its poten- 
tial remains to be seen.

'Frozephibian' 

How Frogs Freeze Solic 




By Rachel R. Smith 



Al this time of the year, the term "T 
am freezing" is throivn around a lot. 
It is pretty cold out and if one stayed 
out long enough \vithoui appropriate 
clothing, they woLdd indeed freeze. 
With that said, think about the forest 
animals how cold they must be in the 
depths of winter witli these negative 
temperatures. Mammals have fur coats 
and birds have feathers to keep them 
warm, but what about frogs? What 
happens to those little naked amphib- 
ians when the temperatures plunge? 
Many frogs can burrow below the front 
line to live to see anollier spring, but 
some unfortunately cannot and their 
alternative is fascinating. 

Bob Dispenza is a Park and Educa- 
tion Manager at Metea County Park in 
theAllen County Parks Department. In 
his article "Frogcicles", Dispenza tells of 
how some frogs in our area can freeze 
solid and yet somehow reanimate when 
the bitter winds head back north. The 
Eastern gray tree frog, Copes gray tree 
frog. Spring peeper, Chorus frog, and 
Wood frog can all perform this amaz- 
ing feat. According to Dispenza with- 



out the ability lo survive freezing, they 
would not make it through the cold 
weather. 

The frogs have developed a way to 
push the water out of their cells to pre- 
vent it from freezing inside and ruptur- 
ing tlie cell wall, killing the cell and po- 
tentially the organism. The frogs also 
manufacture glycerol, the frog equiva- 
lent of antifreeze that the frog can use 
asasourceofenergywhile thebloodis 
frozen. 

During this (ime, heanbeat and res- 
pfration ceases. Although technically 
dead, within 12 hours of thawing the 
frogs have come back to life. Dispenza 
jokes that they go about "croaking, eat- 
ing, mating, singing songs about being 
green and searching for princesses." 

These fascinating frogs give the 
word "hibernate" a whole new mean- 
ing. They can freeze up to some rela- 
tively low negative temperatures with- 
out actually dying. These creatures are 
great for teaching children about our 
northern habitat and for educating 
others on how even harsh extremes can 
bring out the most interesdng charac- 
teristics in our areas frequently looked 
over animal life.

frogs, e-mail Bob Dispenza at bdispenz

Glorious days when athletes were gods 



In My Day - opEd 

ByWIIUpchurch 

wi 1 1 . u pdiu rch @1 pfwco m mu n I ca to r.o rg 



In My Day... 

Brett Favre's quarterback rating was higher than 
his age. 

No really! lliis guy used to be good. (1 can tell I 
lost half my audience when the column went football 
related, but hey this is getting published after the 
Super Bowl, and I'm already in withdrawal mode!) 
You might be thinking I'm being a little unfair to 
HI, since he did take his 'oilier" team to tlie NFC 
Championship game last year, but thai has to be 
seen as an aberration when compared to most of the 
decade. 

The world of professional and amateur sports 



has really changed since I first went to college. Did 
you know as I was attending my freshman retreat (a 
week in cabins in an East Texas forest) the first ever 
professional basketball players lo compete in the 
Summer Olympics were playing as The Dream Team? 
Magic lohnson was, controversially at the lime, 
playing on the team despite recently revealing he was 
HI\' positive. 

Seriously, imagine this team: Michael Jordan, 
Magic lohnson, Larry Bird, Karl Malone. John 
Stockton, Charios Barkley, Scottie Pippen, David 
Robinson, Patrick l-wing, Chris Mullin, Clyde 
Drexler, and Christian Laettner. It was sick, and ihey 
destroyed their opponents by an average of 44 points. 
One opponent was more interested in signaling his 
teammate to take a picture of him guarding Magic 
Johnson than in actually defending him. 

A lot has changed in sports since my day. 

-The NPL dldn'l have two-point conversions 



or Instant replay, and it was Illegal to cali plays In 
through a helmet microphone. 

-The NBA allowed hand- checking, there were 
a lot less time outs, and Michael Jordan was still 
human. 

-Professional hockey wasn't played In the 
desert. 

-Baseball players still chewed tobacco, and 
nobody cared what idnd of drugs they were on. 

Seriously, 1 don't understand the big stink about 
baseball players and "performance-enhancing 
drugs." It's like penalizing beer for helping you gel 
through a boring party, it's like saying ihat adding 
ninjas doesn't make any movie better. It's nol like 
baseball is a very physical spori. I mean, if you want to 
ban Troy Polamalu irom increasing his killing power, 
that's one thing. But why stop guys from increasing 
the likelihood that somediing exciting will happen 
during a baseball game?

PinkOut takes on added importance this year 



By Dan Vance 

dan.uanceSipfwco mmuni c3lo r o rg 



This Saturday. IPFW will host 
the second annual PinkOut event to 
promote breast cancer awareness. 

In 2008, IPFW was the first school 
in the history of the Summit League to 
host such an event. 

The PinkOut event was started 
by the Wom'en's Basketball Coaches 
Association to raise breast cancer 
awareness in the world of women's 
basketball and on campuses and in 
communities. 

This year, the PinkOut theme means 
a little bit more all around the country' 
this year. Kay Yow, the longtime coach 
of the North Carolina State women's 
team, died recently after a more than 
20-year battle \vith breast cancer. 

The loss of Yow perhaps draws more 
attention from the world outside of the 
situation to awareness of the illness. 

"Whenever you have someone 



as important to women's college 
basketball as Kay Yow- when she 
passes, it really gets attention," IPFW 
women's coach Chris Paul noted. 

Yow was laid to rest last Saturday 
and teams across 
America honored 
her with the use 
of the color pink 
in their uniforms, 
shoes, warm-up 
shirts and even 
referee whistles. 

The Women's 
BasketballCoaches 
Association issued 
a waiver last week 
to allow teams 
to wear pink 
game jerseys, 

headbands, and 
shooting shirts to honor Yow until 
February 22, outside of planned 
PinkOut events across the country. 

"It is very hard for any of us to go

through even one day ivithout meeting 
or talking to someone who hasn't 
been touched by breast cancer," IPFW 
athletic director Tommy Bell in a press 
release on Iheevent. " We willonce again 
take the lead-off 
step in the Summit 
League's support of 
this initiative and 
show our support 
for those who have 
.survived breast 
cancer." 

"It's a female 
disease but it 
affects all of us. It 
affects husbands 
and sons," Paul 
added, 

The event will 
begin ivith a private 
pre-game reception for survivors who 
have registered for the event. The 
women's game will begin at i;30 p.m. 
and the survivors will be honored at 




halfUme of the game. 

Last year, the women wore pink 
warm-ups and shoes during the game. 
But Paul believes that the game itself is 
secondary. 

"We as coaches and players can use 
sports to draw attention to awareness 
and use sport as a platform for causes," 
Paul said. 

Again this season, IPFW v/ill be at 
the forefront of the Summit League as 
the first school in conference to hold 
a PinkOut event during the 2008-2009 
season. 

"Anything that we can do to show 
tlial supporting the community and 
causes is very important," Paul said. 
"Sometimes that kind of get overiooked 
because we as coaches want to win 
every game, but there are things that 
are more important." 

More information on the event 
can be obtained from Ron Clark in 
athletics. He can be contacted via e- 
mail at clark@ipfiv.edu. 



More Track 
records fall 
at B. Green 

IPFW track athletes 
Crysiina Martinez and Katy 
Moore put their names in 
the record books for the 
third time this season over 
the weekend at the Tom 
Wright Classic hosted by 
Bowling Green University. 

Crystina Martinez has 
put a stranglehold on 
the distance records as a 
Mastodon, setting school 
records in the 5,000-meter, 
3,000-meter, and mile runs 
in successive weekends, 
with the most recent, the 
mile run. coming this 
afternoon. Martinez' time 
of 4:59.53 was over ten 
seconds faster than the 
previous time of 5:09.64 
held by Ashley Ritchey. 

Katy Moore has set 
the school record in the 
high jump three limes this 
season, including twice in 
the last two weeks, with her 
most recent leap of 5-feet, 3- 
inches lopping her previous 
best by an inch, placing 
third in the competition. 

Martinez' mile was the 
top time in the meet, with 
twin sister Crystal out- 
leaning Autumn Dettmann 
of Bowling Green for second 
place overall in a time of 
5:09.27, which also would 
have broke the school 
record. Felicia Mondry 
{6th/5:24.24). Kim Matusik 
(801/5:28.311, and Annina 
Gruber (13tii/5:40.95) 

rounded out the Mastodon 
contingent in the mile. 

Ali Paul had a first-place

"1 didnt say anything,

"So all we did was try to get 
them to revert back to the way 
they were playing in practice

And just like that. IPFW 
found the biggest key to success

They carried it through

Fife's team hits Dakota roadblock 



By Dan Vance 

dan.vanceOJpfwcommunii3tcir.org 



The IPFW men's basketball 
team took a Irip this past weekend 
to the frigid -temperature Dakoias 
and hit a massive Summit League 
roadblock. 

The game standing in IPFW's 
way was expected to be Satur- 
day's showdown witli North Da- 
kota State. The Bison were 8-1 in 
conference play headed into the 
weekend and atop the Summit 
League standings. 

But before IPFW couid even 
gel to Fargo, they fell an unlikely 
victim 10 Soutli Dakota Stale, 76- 
60 on Thursday evening. IPFW 
had previously defeated the lack- 
rabbits in Fort Wayne, 100-66. 

"We didn't play. South Dako- 
ta forced us into not playing our 
best game. Give' credit to them," 
a dejected Dane Fife said after the 
game. 

The Mastodons were put in a 
lough spot in a close second half 
when a technical foul was issued 
against the team. The call took a 
one point IPFW lead and turned it 
into a Eliree-point SDSU lead. 

Another technical was cred- 
ited to the IPFW bench with just 
l:-!? left and IPFW down mo for 
a delay of game on a made bas- 
ket. The call, still vague for tliose 
not in attendance, cost IPFW mo- 
mentum. 

"He's a very good referee, he's 
going to ref the Final Four here 
pretty soon," Fife said of referee 
Bo Boroski, who made the call. 
"1 asked him if he would call that 
the same way, with the score and 
time, in the National Champion- 
ship game and he said yes and 
said ok. then that's the right call. ' 

"Our guys just battled through 



it the whole night, they just bat- 
tled, batded, batded," Jackrabbit 
coach Scott Nagy said with relief 
on his face. 

"Everybody knows we have 
four home games left and we flat 
out need to win them. All I can 
control is what we are trying to do 
against these guys," Nagy added 
of the current close nature of the 
Summit League race. 

Nick Daniels was strong in the 
second half and ended with 16 to- 
tal points to lead IPFW. Anthony 
Cordova led SDSU with 1 1 . 

On Saturday, NDSU picked up 
their eighth straight wan and their 
tenth in the Summit League with 
a 74-46 drumming of tlie Mast- 
odons. Ben Woodside scored 21 
for NDSU, while David Carson 
countered with a game-high 22 
for IPFW. NDSU however had 
three more double-figure scorers 
while IPFW's next most prolific 
scorer for the night was freshman 
Trey McCorkle with six. 

NDSU came out in the second 
half, putting the game virtually 
away with a 1 7-2 run. 

"Our offense stagnated at the 
end of the first half, but once 
we came out in the second half 
and got tlie movement from the 
screens, we were able to get some 
different looks," Bison coach Saul 
Phillips said. "The key to that is 
passing and catching, andwhen 
we play like we did in the second 
half, we resemble an unselfish 
team that any coach would be 
proud of" 

IPFW was out rebounded 39- 
25. 

With the weekend losses, 
IPFW stays in ninth place in the 
Summit League, one spot out of 
the eight-team conference tour- 
nament and trailing Western Il- 
linois by one game. NDSU is still

coming in the first half, 
while adding 10 rebounds 
for the double-double. 

Tina Moen and 
Courtney Reed each 
added eight point for the

The loss drops IPFW 
to 2-8 in conference. They 
are now in last place, two 
games behind in ihe race 
for a spot in the next 
month's Summit League 
Tournament. 



Lewis match will be 
real measuring stick 

With conference season now underway, the 
Mastodons will host the Lewis Flyers on Friday. It is 
the only match for the team this weekend. IPFW is 
coming off last weekend's split, beating #14 Loyola- 
Chicago and falling 3-0 to #13 Ohio State. 

"On Saturday, we saw what happens ivith very 
young teams. We didn't have the energy to compete 
with an Ohio State team that is a little bit better than 
the Loyola team," coach Arnie Ball said. "We just 
physically and emotionally didn't have the energy to 
compete at tlie level we wanted to compete at " 

The Flyers, the conference preseason favorite, are 
coming off a loss to Ball Stale last week. Prior to the 
loss to Ball State, Lewis swept Carthage and won a 
surprisingly close 3-2 ivin over Lindenwood, a NAIA 
program. Flyer junior Nathan Klass was named MIVA 
Player of the 
Week for those | 
two matches. 

IPFW will I 
be coming in 
with a full week 
to prepare 

just for Lewis. 
Ball says that I 
preperation 
vAW be much 
like it was last 
week, where 
they prepared 
exclusively 
for the Loyola 
match. 

" T h e y I 
are a very 
experienced 
team and ARGUE: Darryl Shank disputes 

having lost a call in Saturday's 3-0 loss to 
to Ball State Qhio State, 
last weekend, 

they're going to become in here with a little fire in 
, their eyes, not wanting to get upset twice," Ball said. 

With iPFVJ playing on opposite ends of the 
spectrum last week, the match with Lewis should be 
a good measurement of where the team is at. 

Ball says that competition in practice is helping 
the growth of the young squad. Freshman Dan Mader 
and junior Corey Stewart are currenUy balding at 
setter and Ball started two other freshmen on Friday.
