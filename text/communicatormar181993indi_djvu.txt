Find work 
at Job Fair 

By Felicia {.leeching 

Editor-ln-Chlef 

and Laura Llneback 

Acting Managing Editor 



On Thursday, March 25, from 10 
a.m. 10 2 p.m. Die 1 3th Annual Job 
Fair commences ai Walb Memorial 
Union Ballroom. Approximately 45 
area businesses, industries, govern- 
menial agencies, and camps will be 
represented lo offer summer employ- 
ment opportunities for interested 
students. 

"We have a theme: 'Target Your Job 
Needs,"' said Sherry Cunningham of 
student employment. 

"The Job Fair may be critical for 
some students to obtain summer jobs 
to pay for schooling. Not being able 
lo find a job may prevent ihem from 
reluming lo school in the fall," said 
Mary Ball Brant, coordinator for stu- 
dent employment. 

The Job Fair takes place at many 
colleges and universities. Student and 
employer evaluations have indicated 
that IPFW's Job Fair is one of the 
best in northern Indiana. 

In many cases, jobs extend beyond 
summer. 

"OHen, employers looking for 
pan-time workers offer them ex- 
tended positions due to the ccono-

my," said Brant. 

Cunningham advises students to be 
prepared with their past work history 
in order to complete the applications, 

"There is a good mix of employ- 
ers from various businesses: lawn 
service, health care, those involv- 
ing graphic an, and fast food," 



said Cunningham, 

Brant encourages students to attend 
and find out what is available in the 
summer job market. 

"A mix of traditional and non-nadi- 
uonal jobs for students will be repre- 
sented, even entrepreneurial opportu- 
nities," added Brant. 



Students, committees decide 
Campus may become smokefree 



by Laura Llneback 
Acting Managing Editor 

A smoke- free environment for Walb 
Memorial Union is being studied by 
the IPFW Steering Committee for the 
Implementation of the Smoking Poli- 
cies. The Union is the only building 
on campus where smoking is allowed 
in designated areas. Currently, smok- 
ing is allowed in the cast lounge on 
the first floor and the south side of the 
cafeteria. 

The Steering Committee, composed 
of university staff and students, was 
formed in 1986. It helped effect the 
ban on smoking from other campus 
buildings. It is composed of universi- 
ty staff and students. 

Due to recent findings from the 
studies on the effects of second-hand 
smoke. Steering Committee members 
fell thai ihe seriousness of the smok- 
ing issue for Walb Union warranted 
investigation. 

In February, a survey was sent to 
employees of the Walb Union to as- 
sess their views as to wheiher or not 
smoking should be continued. Of the 
ninety-two sent, eighty-two surveys 
were returned. Fifty-four full-time 
employees, seven pan -time employ- 



ees, and twenty-one part-time student 
employees responded. 

Fifty-six persons noted that smok- 
ing should be eliminated on the first 
floor east lounge, forty said that the 
south side of the cafeteria should be 
smoke-free, and twenty-six decided 
that smoking should be allowed in 
both areas. Forty persons indicated 
that smoking should be banned from 
both the cafeteria and the first floor 
lounge. 

"We're just a recommending body," 
said Barbara Blauvclt, secretary for 
history and political science and chair 
of die Steering Committee. 

Blauvclt said that student govern- 
ment has been asked for its recom- 
mendations. Rajat Sun, student body 
president is coordinating a survey re- 
questing students' opinions. 

After student government gives its 
suggestions for appropriate action, 
the university chancellor makes the 
final decision. 

"I would expect (policy changes) to 
be effective by July 1st or the begin- 
ning of the fall semester (of 1993)," 
said Blauvelt. 

Sun" believes that students should 
have the final say as to whether or not 
the smoking policy should be

IPFW Biology class finds snow, not fun 



By Felicia Beeching 
Editor in chief 

Spring break last week turned out to 
be a cruel joke for some IPFW facul- 
ty and students. James Haddock, as- 
sociate professor of biology, and a 
dozen students went on a class field 
trip during spring break to the Florida 
Keys. 

"I've held this marine biology field 
trip every other year during spring 
break for 20 years," said Haddock. 

Things were going well until Satur- 
day morning at 3 a.m. High winds 
and pouring rains blew the campers 
out of their tents. Everyone was plan- 
ning to leave Saturday morning any- 
way. So ihe wet biology students 
packed up and headed back for Indi- 
ana in their individual vehicles . 

Haddock decided to drive to Atlanta 
and take interstate highway 1-75 
home, but the blizzard of the century 
dumped 12 inches of snow on Atlanta 
before he arrived. 
"When we drove into Atlanta, it 
looked like a ghost town. All the mo- 
tels were taken, so I decided to keep 
heading toward home, but I could on- 
ly drive 15-20 miles per hour on I- 
75," said Haddock. 
What he didn't know was that four 



semi-trucks had jackknifed 30 
miles north of Atlanta causing 
traffic to be backed up for 10 
miles. Cars and trucks were in the 
dilches everywhere. 

"I was in a pickup truck stuck in 
five lanes of traffic. So we slept in the 
middle of 1-75 from 1 to 5 ajn. Satur- 




changed for Walb Union. 

"The prime focus of this building 
is for students' use. I. personally, 
am a non-smoker, but I don't 
want to force my opinions on some- 
one else." said Suri. 

Last Monday, siudcnt senate formed 
a committee to study the situation and 
distribute surveys. Surveys should be 
available by the beginning of next 
week and the results may be known 
by April 15. 

Other area campuses have also dealt 
with the problem of smokers vs. non- 
smokers. Purdue University Calumet 
eliminated smoking from all the cam- 
pus buildings in August, 1992, ac- 
cording to Judy Brciz of Calumet uni- 
versity relations. 

Indiana University Nonhwest 
(Gary) has eliminated smoking from 
all buildings as a new policy effective 
last Monday. 

Suri believes that one possibility, 
considered by committees in other IU 
and Purdue campuses, is the con- 
struction of shelters for smokers in 
the event that smoking in Walb is 
prohibited. "But that is quite cosily in 
itself," said Suri. 



IPFW Music presents performances 
of Gian-Carto Mcnotti's comic op- 
eras. The Old Maid and ihe Thief and 
The Telephone. Two public perfor- 
mances take place on Thursday, 
March 27 at 8:00 p.m. and Sunday, 
March 28 at 2:00 pm. in Ncff Recital

day night," said Haddock. . 

In the morning he drove 10 miles 
back to Atlanta in the northbound 
lane going south until he could find 
an exit. Back in Atlanta, people en- 
couraged him to drive 125 miles to 
Birmingham. Alabama, if he wanted 
to eventually go north. 

Ten hours laicr. Haddock arrived in 
Birmingham after having seen hun- 
dreds of abandoned cars and trucks, 
including two police cars, two EMS 
vehicles, and two snowplows. 
"Anytime I saw a Georgia, Flori- 



da, or Alabama license plate dri- 
ving on the road, I went nuts. They 
would spin out because they don't 
know how lo drive on ice and 
snow," explained Haddock. "It was 
pandemonium," 

On Sunday night. Haddock and his 
wife slept in a motel, but the room 
was dirty. The personnel apologized, 
but said that no one could get to 
work. The Haddocks felt fonunaie 
because they didn'i have to sleep on 
the dining room floor with the fifty 
people who couldn't get a room. 

Haddock arrived back in Fort 
Wayne late Monday night, but as of 
press deadline Tuesday, some of his 
class was still stranded dtroughout Ihe 
Deep South. 

[Editor's note: Other faculty in- 
cluding Wen Hui-Tsai, of sociology, 
Robert Sedlmcyer of computer sci- 
ence, and Richard Johnson of peace 
studies didn't make it back in time for 
classes Monday. Two Communicator 
staffers, Sports Editor Michael Bass, 
and humor writer, Tim Schreiber, 
were also stranded. Bass made it back 
just in time for press deadline Tues- 
day afternoon. We still haven't heard 
from Schreiber.... although his par- 
ents said he is snow shoveling his 
way back home.]

President introduces aid strategies 



On Monday, March 1, the 32nd an- 
niversary of John F. Kennedy's 
founding of the Peace Corps, Presi- 
dent Ginton challenged young peo- 
ple across the nation to "answer the 
call to service" and outlined his pro- 
gram to make a college education 
available to every American. 

In an impassioned address to over 
ten thousand students at the Rutgers 
University Athletic Center in Piscat- 
away, New Jcrsery, the President in- 
vited his audience to join him in "a 
great national advcniure that will 
change America forever, and for the 
Betier." 

The President also announced his 
"Summer of Service" summer lead- 
ership training program in which 
over 1.000 young people will work 
on service projects with children at 
risk. The summer program will 
serve as forerunner to a much larger 
program which will eventually allow 
over 100,000 young people to pay 
their way to college through com- 
munity service. 



Under the President's plan, young 
people could borrow the money for 
college from the government, then 
pay back the loan in one of two 
ways: either as a small percentage of 
their income over time, or through 
one or two years of community ser- 
vice work before, during, or after 
college. 

In his remarks, the President en- 
couraged listeners io "drop me a 
line" if they were inieresied in the 
summer program, or to tell him what 
kind of service projects exist in their 
communities and what kinds they 
would like to see. Following the 
speech, the President discussed the 
program in detail during an inter- 
view with MTV's Tabitha Soren. 

Oiher members of the administra- 
tion echoed the President's chal- 
lenge at various service sites across 
the country. In Madison. Wisconsin 
Vice President Al Gore toured Ihe 
University of Wisconsin Arboretum 
built by young people in the Wis- 
consin Conservation Corps. Later he 



discussed the national service initia- 
tive with students at a town hall 
meeting in the University of Wis- 
consin Union, 

Mrs. Tipper Gore visited the Child 
Day Care Center and the Flagler 
Home at St. Joseph's Villa, a transi- 
tional housing program offered by 
the University of Richmond. 

In North Carolina, Secretary of the 
Interior Bruce Babbitt helped mem- 
bers of the Durham Service Corps 
build a trail at the Clemmons Educa- 
tional Slate Forest, in Clayion. In 
Bosion, Secretary of Labor Robert 
Reich visited members of Youth- 
build, a corps of youths who rehabil- 
itate low-income housing. And in 
the Nation's Capital, Secretary of 
Health and Human Services Donna 
Shalala visited with members of DC 
Service Corps who work with se- 
verely ill children at the Hospital for 
Sick Children-

dent managers are involved in all as- 
pects of the evenu from preparing the 
meal, to designing and planning the 
menu and decorations, as well as 



working with profit and loss state- 
ments." explained Dr. Knight. 

This exercise also includes hiring of 
the staff and working in cooperation 
with chefs of local restaurants. 
"Management skills are stressed in 
this program, not just the culinary 
arts," said Knighi. The entire event 
has an impact on the student's grade. 

Tickets are now available for the 
fourth dinner of this series to be held 
on Wednesday, March 31 at the Fori 
Wayne Marriott Hotel. This dinner 
will feature an Italian theme. Buffet 
style "stations" will be set up where 
guests may choose from breads and 
amipasio, pas la's and saute, as well as 
wine, dessert and coffee. 

The Elegant Farmer will play host 
to the April 7th dinner with the theme 
"Great American Flair." The price 



for this dinner is an outstanding value 
beginning with a wine and cheese re- 
ception and following up with prime

The final dinner of the series, the 
Chaine des Rousscurs will be held at 
the Park Place Grill on April 28. It 
will feature such French specialties as 
Duck Breast Salad and Salmon Baked 
in Fillo. Dr. Knight gave a brief his- 
tory of this culinary society. It began 
as a food and wine society in 1 248 in 
France wiih geese being cooked on a

Senior class called 
to support school 



IPFW is noi Ihe only university 
till by hard economic limes. Na- 
tionwide, public iwo-ycar and four- 
year colleges and universities arc 
beset by budget difficulties. In- 
creased tuitions, class size growth. 
limited course selections, holds on 
faculty hirings, administrative 
salary freezes, limited library re- 
sources, and reduced spending on 
buildings and equipment all axe 
consequences of funding worries. 

According to "Campus Trends, 
1992," possible long-term effects 
of budget difficulties include 
greater reliance on tuition rev- 
enues, delays in maintenance atten- 
tion, redistribution of departmen- 
tal resources, and inability to 
update labs and 
equipment. 

A supreme ex- 
ample, of which 
most IPFW stu- 
dents arc quiic 
aware, is the 
Hclmkc Library. 
Helpful and 

friendly siaff can- 
not case the frus- 
trations of the in- 
ability to locate 
needed resources 
for the last minute 
paper. And the ex- 
cellent document 
delivery system, 
which brings ma- 
terials io students from any of the 
other IU libraries, docs not always 
deliver in time. 

What do the institutions of high- 
er learning do in times of crisis? 
Some cut, consolidate, reduce, or 
eliminate; others strive for greater 
efficiency. 

But Thomas D. Accio, president 
of North Adams State College in 
Massachusetts refuses to yield to fi- 
nancial duress. "We had to quit 
seeing ourselves as victims of the 
decisions of others and develop a 
belief that we can and will direct 
our own destiny despite what oth- 
ers may do." said Accto. All — fac- 
ulty, staff, and students — have be- 
come involved in working to bring 
about excellence in this public lib- 




eral a: 
So, 

lain and improve existing stan- 
dards? While faculty and staff are 
surely "siratcgizing," and student 
government strives io gain greater 
student involvement, much is yet to 
be desired. 

Seniors, "now is ihe lime for 
every good aJumna/us to come to 
the aid of her/his university." As 
the time of the graduating class gift 
pledge campaign draws near, class 
re pre sen la lives will call upon all 
'93 graduates to solicit contribu- 
tions for the class gift. Funds will 
go toward badly needed campus 
improvement, or the upgrading of 
learning resources and equipment, 
or Ihe establish- 
ment of a need- 
based scholarship 
fund. 

Though school 
debts, family ex- 
penses, and em- 
ployment uncer- 
tainty may tempt 
you lo respond 
negatively to the 
pledge solicitor, 
remember that 
your economic 
limes will not al- 
ways be dismal. 
A job will come, 
jj and in eighteen 
months, when you 
pay apart of the S60, 
$75, or $93 pledge, the amount will 
seem quiie paltry. 

Now that you will soon be fin- 
ished, why should you care? You 
should care because IPFW has 
been your educational "home" for a 
few or many years. You are able to 
empathize with those who will 
struggle with the double burden of 
studying and working while sacri- 
ficing lime for friends and family. 
You will understand that little ex- 
tras, such as state-of-thc-an com- 
puter equipment, monetary grants 
or loans, and a comfortable study 
environment mean so much lo stu- 
dents and educational success. 
And. someday, possibly, your chil- 
dren will graduate from fPFW.

A rose to ihe anonymous person 
who wrote a reply to us from Con- 
tinuing Education after the com- 
ment in last week's column. "We 
could balance ll [a checkbook for 
Ihe department] belter lhan Pur- 
due!" We agree, even though that 
anonymous person said thai our 
comments about Purdue weren't 
necessary. On the contrary, Pur- 
due's 'no-brains-ai-lPFW' ap- 
proach needs to be challenged. 
That's what Fiscal Autonomy is 
all about. 

A rose to the outspoken faculty, 
both I.U. and Purdue, who are still 
fighting for IPFW to gain fiscal au- 




tonomy, BUI Frederick, Mike 
Downs, Steve Hollander, and Art 
Flnco. They may have lost a battle 
this year in the General Assembly, 
but ii ain't over ycL 

Some cow chips to Police and 
Safety for their bad public rela- 
tions altitude. A policeman re- 
cently gave a "student" a ticket at 
the meters in front of KctUer Hall, 
even though there was time on the 
meter! The car did not have an 
IPFW lag in the window. lust be- 
cause the car was rusty, did you 
think that person had to be a stu- 
dent? We encouraged this person io 
challenge the ticket. What kind of 
PR. is that for potential students? 

While we're on Police and Safe- 
ty, to their credit, they do deserve a 
rose for the prompt and courte- 
ous way they provide escorts for 
women to their vehicles. We have 
heard this compliment from several 
women, including the editor in

President submits new financial aid plan 



To theediior: 

I write to challenge you to join me 
in a great American adventure - na- 
tional service. 

I make this challenge because our 
country and our communities need 
help that government alone cannot 
provide. Government can make vac- 
cines available to children, but alone 
it cannot administer shots to them alt. 
Ii can put more police on ihe streets. 
but alone it cannot stop crime. It cart 
improve the quality of our public 
schools, but cannot alone inspire chil- 
dren to live up to their potential. 

It is time for Americans of every 



background to work together to lift 
our country up. neighborhood by 
neighborhood and block by block. It 
is lime to rediscover ihe excite- 
ment and idealism that makes us 
Americans. 

That is what national service is all 
about. 

Through national service, thousands 
will have the opportunity to pay for 
college by rebuilding their communi- 
ties - serving as teachers, police offi- 
cers, health care workers, and in other 
capacities. Bui it will take time for 
these ideas to pass Congress, and 
time to implement them. We must 



That is why I have called for a 
Summer of Service - this summer. 
More lhan 1,000 young people will 
serve in selected areas around the 
country, learning to lead and getting 
children who are at risk ready for 
school. 

There are many who believe that 
young Americans will not answer a 
call to action. They say you are apa- 
thetic, and insist that you measure 
your success in the accumulation of 
material things. I'know iheyare 
wrong, and I know you will answer 
this challenge. 



You can become an agent of renew- 
al - either through the summer pro- 
gram or on your own. Write and tell 
me what you arj doing, or what you 
want to do: 

The White House -

Your efforts and your energies can

Ethnicity inspires student 



To the editor: 

Spring break look me on an excur- 
sion to Louisville, Kentucky with the 
Black Collegian Caucus for the Black 
National Family Conference. This trip 
may not mean a big deal to those of 
other ethnic backgrounds, but for the 
African- Americans that attended, it 
was a very profitable enlightenment 
for all of us. 

Maulana Karenza, the professor 
who started Kwanzaa, spoke on Black 
male and Black female relationships 
as pertaining to family, marriage, 
brotherhood, sisterhood, friendship 
and community. At the dinner ban- 
quet on March 12(h, he basically said 
it is detrimental for African- American 
men and women to respond to the call 
for unity between ourselves and our 
communities. We need reinforcement 
in our African history, education, and 
validity of what is real and what isn't. 
We go to the movies and plays to es- 
cape reatily or the so-called reality we 
think we live in. The truth is, many of 
us are unaware of the reality of how 
people are perceived. Television, 
newspapers, history books, media im- 
ages and stereotypes consciously hold 
many Blacks and Whites in a society 
thai is thought upon as free and de- 
mocratic. If only thai were true. We 
have to take it on ourselves as Blacks 
to move out of social and economical 
conditions ihat hindeT us. 



At the Black National Family Con- 
ference, this was ihe agenda thai con- 
cerned all the people involved. The 
conference embodied Black people 
from all over the country to network 
and motivate one another to prosper 
as a collective community. It enriched 
us all with new ideas that we must 
implement to incorporate a more re- 
sponsible and moral altitude towards 
the Black race. Our children depend 
on it. 

It's a shame that I have to go miles 
away to feel the contentment and em- 
brace the beauty of my heritage and 
culture when there are just as many 
African Americans here in Fort 
Wayne with parallel affluences. 

The only way we can become better 
activators and individuals is to be- 
come spiritually, mentally and truth- 
fully aware of our identity. We are 
heirs to a rich and strong dynasty. 
Lets not let our ancestors down. Us- 
ing ihe seven principles of Kwanzaa. 
an Afrocentric way of life, can be a 
start. They are as follows: 1 . UMO- 
JA- unity, 2. KUJICHAGULIO- self 
determination, 3. UJIMA- collective 
work and responsibility, 4. UJA- 
MAA- cooperative economics, 5. 
N1A- purpose, 6. KUUMBA- creativ- 
ity and 7. IMANI- faith.

Writer criticizes, apologizes 



To the editor: 

It has been brought to my attention 
that 1. in my acerbic and heavy- 
handed fashion, caused at least one 
of the individuals named in my re- 
cent letter to this paper regarding the 
up-coming Theatre Gala (Commu- 
nicator 3/4/93), to take personal 
offense. 

To those individuals named in the 
aforementioned letter I apologize. It 
was not my intent to personally in- 
sult either Joanne Lantz, Abe Bas- 
sett, or Steven Sarratore. I believed 
it would be understood by any read- 
er that in criticizing a university 
chancellor, dean, or department 
chair, I was, in fact, criticizing the 
office, or the office-holder in their 
official capacity, and not neces- 
sarily the personal integrity of the 
individual. 

Understand, however, that I am not 



department's assurances notwith- 
standing that theater majors would 
be allowed to attend the event if 
they choose to work as ushers and 
thai the profits, if any, (not proceeds) 
of the Gala would go to the theater's 
scholarship fund. 1 still believe this 
event to be elitist and exclusionary 
in that it excludes virtually nineiy- 
nine percent of die IPFW communi- 
ty by way of the S100.00 per ticket 
price. 

In the future, one would hope, in- 
put from the respective representa- 
tive bodies of students and faculty 
might be solicited and given due 
consideration before such decisions 
are reached.

A Hoosier writes about Hoosiers 



By Nathan Somers 
Staff writer 

It's been a while since I've written 
for the Communicator. So I thought 
I should wade in slowly, select a non 
offensive lopic and do a sort of fire- 
side chat kind of column. You know, 
one of those innocuous columns that 
starts out, "Have you ever wondered 
where your missing socks go?" or 
ihe fresh and daring lopic, 
"Why don't my teenage 
kids ever listen?" 

Then once I've thoroughly 
endeared myself to you 
Hoosier hayseeds, I will be- 
gin my systematic corruption 
of the youth and condemna- 
tion of ail those who oppose 
my narrow, draconian beliefs. 

Actually, I'm a native of In- 
diana loo, but that doesn't 
mean I'm above opening the 
gates for the savage kitten- 
eating Buckeye Barbarians of (^ 
the East. Nor am I incapable 
of abetting infiltrators from 
the Land of Lincoln. Heck, 
I'd do about anything for a 
generous serving of potato 
salad and mcatloaf, our native 
cuisine. For the benefit of 
those who do not understand 
(i.e., those of you who arc unclean 
immigrants from one of the lesser 
states), I am referring to Indiana's 
rich and zesty culture and its pro- 
tracted feuds with its neighbors. 

To understand the pride and tenaci- 
ty of Hoosiers, you must understand 
our proud history. In 1630, when Eu- 
ropeans first encountered Hoosiers 
in the area of what is now Hunting- 
ton, they were so awed by the an- 
cient civilization that they immedi- 
ately began dismantling it. Hoosiers 
had already developed a remarkably 



; calendar, which marked the 
eclipses, fail and spring equinoxes, 
winter and summer solstices, winter 
and summer Olympics, and regional 
high school basketball play-offs. 
Hoosiers dwelt in prefabricated mo- 
bile homes, which were limbered by 
teams of cocker spaniels. The 
Hoosiers followed thunderstorms all 
spring and summer, in hopes that a 
tornado would touch down and bless 




their camp. To this day, many tradi- 
tional Hoosiers still dwell in mobile 
homes out of respect for the tornado 
spirit. 

Hoosiers were, and continue to be, 
a very spiritual people. As children, 
Hoosiers are taught to respect na- 
ture. A Hoosier never kills an animal 
unless he intends to hang it on his 
wall. And a Hoosier never leaves 
garbage by the roadside thai is too 
heavy to blow away with the wind. 
Sundays arc still a very spiritual day 
for Hoosiers. For centuries. Hoosiers 



have outlawed alcohol, commerce, 
and even some sexual positions on 
this hallowed day. Instead. Hoosiers 
stay home and watch TV out of re- 
spect to the Great Spirit. 

As the Hoosiers resisted the Euro- 
pean invaders, the natives of Ohio 
and Illinois (pronounced IL-uh- 
NOVZ by Hoosiers) quickly assimi- 
lated. While some anthropologists 
may contend that Hoosiers have on- 
ly a "slight regional accent". 
it was this language barrier 
which was panly responsible 
for the bloodshed in the 
Crossroads state. Hoosicr's 
pronunciation of wash as 
"warsh", get as "git", and 
pretty as "priddy" infuriated 
Europeans, Buckeyes, and 
Lincolniics. The lighting con- 
tinued until the 1870's, when 
ii climaxed with the Hoosier 
Border Wars. Several of our 
most obscure presidents, in- 
cluding Rutherford B. Hayes, 
Grover Cleveland, and 
Chester E. Arthur fought 
bravely tn these wars, proving 
(hey had the metdc to whip 
the young nation back into 
stagnation. 
In a rootless, melting-pot 
nation, Indiana is a cultural anchor 
in a sea of confused people seeking 
roots and smaller pots. We Hoosiers 
have a long, proud history, but we're 
also a playful, affectionate people. 
Offer any Hoosier tickets to a mon- 
ster truck festival, and you'll have a 
friend for life. Hopefully, visitors to 
our state, and even natives who 
aren't aware of their surroundings, 
have learned a lot from this column. 
I hope that all you out-of-siate mon- 
grels enjoy your stay here. 



Army student writes commentary 



Could you use S 2 1,000 for college? 
This is the minimum you would make 
on a standard Army Reserve enlist- 
ment. Would you like to receive valu- 
able training? The Army can provide 
you with training in the field of your 
degree Would you like to have cama- 
raderie? The army will insure it. 

Have you ever walked into a room 
and felt like you were out of place-, 
like you didn't fit in? I have, and I 
don't like that feeling. That's a feeling 
I have never had in the Army Reserve. 

As an Army Reservist and war veter- 
an. I can tell you that the Army Re- 
serve can provide you with the proud 
tradition of the American citizen-sol- 
dier. The atmosphere and rapport arc 
like no other. You stand tall, feci 
proud, have an inner stability and 
strength. A soldier takes pride in his 
uniform and himself. When you arc in 
a uniform you arc pan of a strong, sup- 
portive family; you never know a 
stranger. When the individual soldier 
stepped off the airplane in Saudi Ara- 
bia, he became a pan of the existing 
military family. 

Not only docs the Army bestow a 
feeling of belonging, but it also pro- 
vides valuable lifetime training. It can 
guarantee you training of your choice 
in fields such as finance, personnel, au- 
tomated supply, avionics and electron- 
ics, microwave communication, and 
computer technology. Futhermorc, yjjji 
can cam college credits for the training 
you receive by having your college 
evaluate your military training docu-

Army training give* you an edge 
when seeking a career in the civilian 
job market. For example, rwearchcrs 
at Ohio State University have found 
thai transferability between military 
service and civilian employment is 
high. A September 1990 national sur- 
vey of more than 650 employers found 
that responsibility, motivation and abil- 
ity to work with others arc the qualities 
they want most in their employees. All 
soldiers Icam these skills, whatever 
their job specialty. Other employers of 
Army Reservists wrote: "Leadership is 
at the core of everything the Army 
leaches, and as the global struggles 
facing American business intensify, 
men and women trained to lead in the 
Army become an increasingly attrac- 
tive pool of employees," wrote John F. 
Welch, Jr.. chairman and chief execu- 
tive officer. General Electric Company. 
Edward A. Brcnnan, Chairman. Presi- 
dent and Executive Officer, Scars, 
Roebuck and Co. wrote: "Today's 
complex business environment re- 
quires personnel with discipline, in- 
tegrity and a commitment to quality - 
attributes that are evident in Army 
alumni." These statements support the 
fact that knowledge is important but 
experience, leadership, and adaptabili- 
ty arc accentual.

Global Warming: 'Nothing is going away' 



By Joyce Slocks 
Advertising Manager 

Human beings do noi have the pow- 
er to create or destroy mauer. Ac- 
cording 10 "Living in the Environ- 
ment" by G. Tyler Miller. Jr., "Every- 
thing you Ihink you have thrown 
away is siill here with us in one form 
or another; there is no away." Be- 
cause of this principle of matter, 
every environmental action you take, 
whether destructive or remedial, has 
a reaction which either stresses, or 
not, the biosphere within which you 
live. 

One of the environmental reactions 
which is stressing our earth is global 
warming, which changes current 
global attitudes and actions. Current 
carbon dioxide (C02) gas emissions 
haven't gone away - they are trapped 



in the atmosphere where they will re- 
main for about 500 years. 

Chlorofluocarbons (CFCs) haven't 
gone away, cither. They, are trapped 
in the atmosphere for anywhere from 
60 to 400 years. 

Miller states that CFCs "generally 
have 10,000 to 20.000 times the im- 
pact per molecule on global warming 
that each molecule of C02 has; 
methane is about 25 times more ef- 
fective in wanning the troposphere 
than a molecule of carbon; and the 
global warming from each molecule 
of nitrous oxide is about 230 times 
that of a C02 molecule- 
Methane (CH4) is another green- 
house gas, but it is not trapped in the 
atmosphere, nor has it gone away. In- 
stead it resides in the troposphere 
where it will remain for 7 to 10 years. 
Nitrous oxide (N20), a gas released

hasn't gone away 

This gas, like methane, resides in 
the troposphere for about 150 years. 

Once you understand that nothing is 
going away, you understand that what 
you arc doing is merely shuffling out- 
puts. Shuffling outputs stresses the 
earth - globally. 

There arc several grounds for 
change. F' 
controlling the 
outputs of the 
Most Developed 
Countries (MD- 
Cs) and the out- 
puts of the Less 
Developed Coun- 
tries (LDCs) 
doesn't work. 

MDCs are pri- 
marily responsi- 
ble for the pro- 
duction of green- 
house gases. LD- 
Cs, with the slash 
and bum agricul- 
ture of indige- 
nous peoples, 
along with de- 
struction of the rain forests, are more 
and more responsible for the prob- 
lems with C02; however, carbon, a 
basic component of all fossil fuels, 
is released whenever they are 
burned (MDCs). 

Second, Miller says that at present 
consumption rates, "world crude oil 
reserves will be economically deplet- 
ed by 2018 at the current consump- 
tion rate and by 2010 if oil use from 
these reserves increases by 2 percent 
a year." This is going to affect us - 
you and me! 

"Climatologists project that atmos- 
pheric concentrations of the earth's 
heat-trapping gases will double 
within the next five decades, primari- 
ly due to carbon emissions from fos- 
sil fuel burning and deforestation," 
said Peter Weber in "State of the 
World - 1993." 

A final reason for change, but not 
the last, is the Unknown Factor, the 
lack of an environmental paradigm. 
This means we are all in this to- 
gether. (You throw a punch and 
my nose hurts.) 




Not knowing the full consequences 
of your actions is an excellent reason 
to support prevention rather than 
cure. You don't have to understand 
the climate in order to understand and 
accept the atmospheric pollution due 
to greenhouse gases, nor do you have 
to understand the climate in order to 
know that MDCs must adopt earth- 
sustainable policies. There is no away 
- only shuffling. 
The question then becomes: What 
policy changes 
should you fa- 
1 There are 
no easy answers, 
but Miller has 
suggested begin- 
g with "input 
thods that 
\ prevent pollution 
and reduce 
wastes. ..not to 
produce so 
much. If you 
don't put some- 
thing into the cn- 
ronment, it 
I't there." 

Begin 
ith reducing 
resource con- 
sumption and waste production, fol- 
lowed by reusing items, then recy- 
cling key mineral resources. 

"Humans are the only species that 
deliberately waste resources," Miller 
writes. "Think globally, act locally. 
Individuals matter." 

We must stress the use of locally 
available perpetual and renewable re- 
sources, and use renewable resources 
no faster than they are replenished by 
natural processes. 

In order to do this, the market price 
of all goods and services should in- 
clude all present and future costs of 
any pollution or Other environmental 
degradation. The disadvantage is that 
we will pay more, but the advantage 
is that we will avoid the shuffling of 
outputs into the atmosphere and 
beyond. 

Subsidies and tax breaks which al- 
low to people to produce harmful 
goods and unnecessarily waste re- 
sources must be stopped. We must 
begin to reward producers who re- 
duce resource waste, pollution, and 
:al degradation. More 



shuffling stopped. 

People in MDCs must begin to put 
the poor and their environment first. 
They should consider not only the 
LDCs but also their own communi- 
ties. Potentially, there arc a lot of 
costs here, but there is an offsetting 
advantage; a sense of pride as a 
species orjec no one lives in poverty. 

Reducing greenhouse gas emmis- 
sions which lead to global warming 
begins with the individual. Not 
Brazil, home to the Amazon rainfor- 
est. Not Sri Lanka, with its huge pop- 
ulation of very, very poor people. Not 
Mongolia, location of the huge Gobi 
desert. Not even the United States 
government, which has the poten- 
tial to do just about anything. You 
arc at the bottom; and I am at the bot- 
tom. We are the ones who can make a 
difference. 



Earth-degrading and earth -de pie ting 
manufacturing processes, products, 
and businesses must be changed into 
earth -sustaining ones. 

"We cannot have a healthy econo- 
my in a sick, environment. Short-term 
greed leads to long-term economic 
and environmental grief." explains 
Miller. 

Make it your own personal policy 
not to buy goods and services from 
eanh-degrading businesses. Make it 
your business to find out. 

Keep in mind that cvcryOiing we 
have or will comes from the canh and 
the sun. Know that die earth can gel 
along without us, but wc cannot get 
along without the earth. Remember, 
an exhausted earth is an exhausted 
economy. Respect your roots. De- 
mand environmental policy changes 
now. Demand this of the world, but 
start today in your own community.

Sexual Harassment 

Student recalls trauma 



ByFelidaBetchlng 
Editor In chief 

Sciual harassment. Could it happen 
ai IPFW? Ask Karen Garrnan, whose 
upcoming graduation in May will be 
bilterswect. She was a victim of sexu- 
al harassment on this campus in 1990. 
She wants other women to know thai 
there is help available if harassed. 

"I was thinking about my daughter 
and what I would e*pcci her to do if 



"/ was afraid of being grilled and was fired 



student were filed. These informal 
complaints spanned a period of a 

dozen years. 

Only the formal complaints could 
be heard at the hearing. 

"The university sia/f were support- 
ive [ai the hearing),™ said Garman. "I 
perceived that they felt it lowered the 
stature of [being) a professor, and 
they were encouraging to me that 
they weren't like (hat; men and 
women included." 

The biology professor was given 
opportunity to resign, but he refused 



and victimized, but the people 
there weren't like that at all." 
-Karen Garman 

she was in this situaiion [sexually ha- 
rassed). I would wont her to stand up 
for her rights and so I knew that's 
what I would have to do." 

Garman 's trauma began innocently 
enough. She had taken a biology class 
and wanted to know how well she had 
done on the final. She knocked on the 
professor's door and he invited her in- 
to his office, They lalkcd for awhile, 
and as she was standing to leave, he 
blocked the door. 

Garman only wants to describe 
what happened ncm as, "...Inappro- 
priate behavior. Afterwards, 1 felt 
dirty." 

Garman went to her friend Linda 
Johnson, the coordinator of the Cen- 
ter for Women and Returning Adults, 
and told her the details of the harass- 
ment. Johnson encouraged her to go 
to the affirmative action/EEO office 
on campus and file a complaint with 
Donna Middlcton. 

What Garman didn't know, was thai 
the week before she filed a complaint, 
another female IPFW student filed a 
sexual harassment complaint against 
this same professor. 

Because both complaints were filed 
in Ihe same time frame against the 
same individual, the university decid- 
ed to hear both cases at the same 
lime, according to Dorothy Basscil, 
assistant to Chancellor Joanne Lantz. 

Garman was apprehensive about the 
hearing and having to relive the inci- 
dent and tell il to others. 

"I was afraid of being grilled and 
victimized, but the people there 
.weren't like that al all," said Garman. 
"They wanted to hear what I had to 
say and get at the truth." 

Attending the hearing were IPFW 
faculty and staff members, an attor- 
ney from Purdue University, the 
IPFW biology professor and his 
attorney. 

Several other women, informally 
and privaicly, came forward lo the ad- 
ministration and shared their stories 
of sexual harassment from this pro- 
fessor after ihe formal complaints by 
Garman and the other unidentified 



Professor receives research grant 



Lucille J. Hess, IPFW associate 
professor of audiology and speech 
sciences, has been selected to re- 
ceive a Fellowship grant by the Lilly 
Foundation to in order to study risk 
factors for language disorders devel- 
oping in infants and toddlers. She 
was among 10 professors selected 
from 47 applicants statewide. Hess 
is only the second IPFW faculty 
member to receive this grant since it 
was started in 1974. 

Hess will be conducting her re- 
search when she takes her sabbatical 
during the 1993-94 school year. Ac- 
cording to Hess, the study of speech 
and language disorders in infants 
and toddlers is a new field. 

"We now know the importance of 
that firsi year of life., most of our 
communications intents — our rea- 
sons for communicaling with others, 
are in place by age iwo." 

Hcss's sabbatical project has three 
goals. The first is to take university 




Lucille Hess 



coursework on family centered in- 
tervention at ihe University of Nonh 
Carolina-Chapel Hill and at the Uni- 
versity of Wi scons in -Oshkosh. The 
second is to observe and participate 
in such intervention programs at 



clinics in North Carolina, Wiscon- 
sin. Ohio, and California that cany 
out the early intervention models. 
She will observe how they arc set up 
and operated and the role each pro- 
fessional plays in a child's care. 

"The grant will allow me to iravcl 
to many of the clinics that use the 
models I'm studying." she said. 

Her third goal is to explore ihe 
databases of the National Center for 
Clinical infant programs in Wash- 
ington, D.C.; the Frank Poricr Gra- 
ham Child Development Center in 
North Carolina; and ihe MacAnhur 
Communications Devolopment In- 
ventory Centers in Washington. In 
these databases Hess hopes to find 
information that can be of use to a 
local group which she is an active 
part of, ihe First Steps Council, an 
early intervention interagency group 
that advocates coordinating services. 

"In Fort Wayne, we have a won- 
derful interest in ihe commitment lo 
children," she said The problem is 
we don'i always have the financial 
support." 



According to Middlcton, affirmative 
aciion officer, this professor was ihe 
first tenured faculty member associat- 
ed wilh Purdue University to be fired 
for sexual harassment. 

"H was an embarrassment to other 
faculty," said Middleton. 

Life has changed for Garman since 
ihe incident. She is more cautious and 
less trusting now. She hopes society is 
changing its attitudes toward women

Trip creates thinking atmosphere 



By Michael Ba ■■■■ 
Sports Editor 

Seventeen hours. 17 hours one-way. 
Thai's how long it lakes lo get from 
Virginia to Ft. Wayne. It is also the 
trip I made coming home from Spring 
Break. 

Seventeen hours of thinking. I fig- 
ure I had at least 2 to 3 thoughts an 
hour concerning the topic of sports in 
America. Don't get me wrong, I 
thought of other things, but somehow 
a guy's mind always returns to 
thoughts of spons. 

So what kind of thoughts did I 
come up with you must be wondering 
(and if you're not, you'd better start 
because you're going to hear them). 

• George Steinbrenner 's back from 
a "lifetime" suspension, players keep 
getting more and more money, and 
baseball seems to be clouded with 
new frightening questions that could 
radically change the course of the 
sport, 

Normally that wouldn't bother me, 
but this year is different because I 
happen to have a team to watch. The 
White Sox are going to be contenders 
and 1 want to sec the action. 

But with sky-rocketing ticket 
prices, will I be able to? If you 
guessed no, you're right, I say the on- 
ly way for prices to become reason- 
able is if baseball imitates football 
and basketball and used a salary cap. 

Will it happen? Probably not. Base- 
ball will keep looking for other ways 
to make money and pass the salary 
cap right up. Baseball owners should 
listen to their mothers more often - 
"A penny saved is a penny earned." 

• Michael Jordan of the Chicago 



Bulls is considered one of the greatest 
players to ever play the game. I will 
not argue that, but if you have 
watched him play in the past you may 
have noticed he is not as aggressive 
as he used to be. 

He seems to lack the enthusiasm 
which helped him become the star he 
is. Watch him play and count how 
many times he pulls the defense out 
because of a drive to the hoop. It was 
that kind of play that helped create 
shots for other team members. Today 
Jordan is content with hitting the out- 
side jumpers and letting the oppo- 



The ball's 
in my court 



nents continue pressuring other play- 
ers. 

If the Bulls want to win a third 
championship, then Jordan is going to 
have to get back in the driver's scat, 
so to speak. 

• Is Fishing a sport? I mean, you sit 
and do nothing for three or four hours 
in hopes of catching something. It's a 
lot like going to watch a baseball 
game. 

• How come the NCAA Division II 
gets no respect? On my vacation, I 
watched a dozen different sports 
shows, including ESPN and The 
Sports Channel, and all their pro- 
grams on college basketball. I have 
read another dozen newspapers, and a 
half dozen sports magazines in hopes 
of seeing how IPFW fared in the Di- 
vision II toumcy. I wasn't able to 
even find when the tourney was going 
on, let alone scores from it. 

Of course, Division 1 gets the lime- 



light - that is expected. However, 
there could be at least some coverage 

on the other divisions. 

• Much of the time on my trip, my 
thoughts turned to when we would 
reach the next bathroom. And 
while I was thinking of the toilet, 
my thoughts turned to the Dallas 
Mavericks. 

Arc they that bad, or is the NBA 
that good? Maybe they should play 
some CBA teams. Dallas versus Ft. 
Wayne? The odds are on the Fury. 

• Wizards? I don't like the name ei- 
ther, but I'll be there opening day. 
Won't you? 

• History has taught us that a good 
slogan can motivate and move peo- 
ple. For example: 'Taxation without 
representation" helped create the rev- 
olutionary war. "Reannex Texas" 
caused the U.S. to go to war against 
Mexico; "Make love, not war" 
strengthened the anti-war sentiment 
in the 1960's. 

Maybe Reebok should take a histo- 
ry lesson. "Planet Reebok. ..No slo- 
gans" !!P--leasc!! 

• As the trip slowly moved forward, 
my thoughts turned elsewhere; my fi- 
ancee waiting at home, tests I have to 
study for, and when arc we going to 
cat. 

One last thought stood before me. 
Thank God for creating the competi- 
tive edge in human beings and allow- 
ing us to have the imagination to cre- 
ate sports - except fishing.

End of season 



Mastodons have eight men out 



By Michael Bass 
Sports Editor 

Like the end of a very dramatic 
movie, the end of the Mastodon's 
basketball season leaves tough ques- 
tions to be answered. 

Coach Andy Piazza, after taking 
the Mastodons to rcgionals and win- 
ning the Great Lakes Valley Confer- 
ence championship for the first time 
in history, will have to answer one 
tough question. 

How will he replace his leaving se- 
niors? Piazza is losing a total of eight 



seniors, most of whom were key fac- 
tors 10 IPFW's success. 
The team Piazza has left arc all 

strong players off" the bench and arc 
proven outside shooters (juniors Jeff 
Smithey and Scott Simmons), but arc 
lacking height and muscle for the in- 
side game. 

The team's only inside man is 
freshman K.C. Runyan who stands at 
six feet and seven inches. Runyan 
saw very little playing time during 
the regular season. 

Sophomore Russ Marcinek will 
have to step up to replace Andre 



Walton. Walton possessed strong 
dribbling and passing ability, strong 
leadership skills, and was a big threat 
defensively leading the team with 
steals. 

Marcinek has seen a lot of playing 
time and has started a few games 
during the season, but lacks the ex- 
perience thai Walton brought to the 

Graduating seniors arc: Andre Wal- 
ton, Sean Gibson, Shane Gibson, 
Doug Renickc, John Hohnsirciicr, 
Pal Murphy. Tony Martin, and Andy 
Licbcn

Purdue University 



Steven c Beering February 8. 1993 

President 



To All Members of the Purdue Community: 

I am writing today about a topic that has been the subject of considerable discussion at Purdue 
in recent months. Student and faculty senates at the Fort Wayne and West Lafayette campuses 
have passed resolutions recommending that the University's non- discrimination policy be amended 
to include specific mention of sexual orientation. Our University Code, following the language of 
federal and state laws, prohibits discrimination on the basis of "race, religion, color, sex, age, 
national origin, handicap, or status as a disabled or Vietnam era veteran." 

More importantly, our current policy prohibits discrimination against any individual or group, 
whether specifically mentioned by law or not. It explicitly states that "Purdue University is 
committed to maintaining a community that recognizes the inherent worth and dignity of every 
person; fosters tolerance, sensitivity, understanding, and mutual respect among its members; and 
encourages each individual to strive to reach his or her own potential." By its nature, a university 
should be an inclusive community free from discrimination. 

While acts of discrimination are wrong because they foster intolerance, incivility, and 
intimidation, they still occur in many segments of our society. It is essential that Purdue University 
demonstrate its intellectual and ethical leadership by reaffirming its strong position against 
discrimination. I am. therefore, reminding all faculty, staff, and students that this University does 
not condone and will not tolerate discrimination, harassment, or intimidation of any individual in 
the University community for any reason. In the course of our recent discussions, proponents of 
amending University policy have emphasized that they seek no special privileges, but rather the 
assurance of equal protection. To the extent the University's authority can offer it, such protection 
now exists and includes prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 

The members of the Board of Trustees and I urge all of you to join us in making our University 
a place where all persons pursue their educational programs or employment free from the 
pernicious effects of discrimination. Let us be guided not only by what is legally required, but by 
what is decent and fair. If all of us work together, we can achieve our mutual goal of a University 
that clearly and unequivocally demonstrates commitment to excellence in teaching and learning, 
values the contributions of every individual, and treasures its diversity. 



Sincerely, 



S»
