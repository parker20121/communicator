average of I.OOO farms have 
gone out o( buslntss every

As commodity programs 
Inagrlculture phase down, It 
seems appropriate lo aiseu 
the govemmail adlvitlea 
begun during the 

STATED PURPOSES 

Ihe ma&gt;ar objectives ol 
the GOmmoifily programs 
were lo Ino-ease the price* 
of farm products; lo 
staUllie luppUea; to Im- 
prove farm Incomes: and to 
eave the family farm. These 
ol&gt;]ectlves were lo be ac- 
complished mainly by 
paying farmen to curtaU 
production, tlius driving up 

The frograms applied 
chieQy lo wheal, com, 
cotton, rice, peanuts, 
tobacco, dairy products. 
wool, and sugar. Meal, 
paid try, fndts. and moat 
vegetables were oever 
deeply Involved. Indusion 
was based mainly on the 
workability of controls and 
OD polltla. At the program's 
peak, commodltle* ac- 
counting tor Ihree-fourths of 
farm income were not 
conlroUed. EteeauK the 
program 'a scope wai 
limited, so too was Ita ability 
to achieve Its objectives. 

The measuring md for 
liices was parity, that is. a 
given amount of the com- 
modity should purdtese the 
some goods and services as 
it did in the period 1910-1911. 
vben tanners enjoyed a 
rdadvdy good slandaid of 
living. 

During the three 
Depreulon year* 
mediately before 
CDactmeotof thoi 
programs (luoa), laini 
' prices averaged 72 perceat 
al parity. During the lost 
three ye4n that tbe 



programs were In aub- 
glantlal full force, 1970-71, 
(arm prices again were 72 
percent of parity, the same 
as tHforc the programs 
began Forty years of ellorl 
had failed lo achieve the 
pari t y prl c e obj ec I Ives . 

Together wilh other 
govcmmenl initiatives, the 
programs did bring about 
some stablilty. The 
disoitroLB price declines of 
1920-21 and 1930-32. when few 
steblliiatlDn programs were 
in elfecl, were not repeated 
alter World War II. when 
there were many such 
programs. 

Supplies 05 well as prices 
-jve» itaUliicd ta,a. degree 
by storing, in government 
hands, the commodllies that 
could not be sold at the 

price. These stocks assured 
consumers ol steady sup- 
plies, but they also 
depressed market prices and 
required deep cuts in (arm 
production. 

Incomes ol the (arm 
population rose absoluldy 
and relatively during Ihe 10- 
year life of the (cograms. 
Before 1333, the average 
Income for (arm people was 
70 percent of that for non- 
farm people. Forty years 
later, their Incomes were 
about equal. This gain In per 
capita farm Income, 
however, was probably due 
□ot so much lo the com- 
modity programs as lo the 
Increase In form siic and 
effldency. the dcdlne in the 
numtMir of farmers, and the 
I oil-farm cor- 



SIDE EFFECTS 

The most profound etfccls. 
however, were unintended, 

adverse in term' o( program 
objectives. 

The greatest ui:.iclits ol 
the program went la the 
operators of the largest 
farms, whose incomes were 
already above tbe farm and 
nonform average. T^e lop 
one perceni of iBrmers 
received 21 percent of the 
paymenla. As-erage farm 
Incomes Increased, but only 
by widening (he gap between 
ridi and poor. 

The big farmers used their 
paymenls lo buy oul Ihdr 
smaller neighbora, speeding 
up the demise ol the small 

Benefits drove up the price 
of farm land. A tobacco or 
peanut allotment was worth 
more than the land on which 
(he crop was grown. Thus 

fall to those who owned Ihe 
land when the program 
began, but an added cost to 
the next generation. 

The commodity programs 
also resulled In the United 
Slates losing markets for its 
exports. For example, from 
1330 until 1961, the United 
Slates held Its cotton 
production to H.I million 
bales. During the same 
period, foreign production ol 
cotton doubled. By curtailing 
production and driving up 









utorihe market- 



that 



came lo exceed Iheir In- f'"^ 



farm. In 1930 there \. ^ 

mitlioo forms: by 1970 there 
were 2.9 million, less than 
half as many. 

ThiB drastic decline in the 
number of farms was camed 
chiefly by technological 
change and resulting (arm 
con sol I da II on. The com- 
modity programs actually 
speeded up this process by 
providing price incentives 
for greater yields per acre. 
sQmulaling the adoption ol 
new large-scale I Hinoiogy . 

A major purpose of the 
commodity proflrvms— per- 
haps the mala one, (hough 
(Dt openly acknowledged — 
was to avert an ap^cultural 
uprising. The Great 
Depression was an uo- 
bel lovable disaster lo 
modera Americans. The 
farm mood In 1933-33 was 

The New I&gt;eal put Inlo 
operation the programs the 
fancfn themselves wanted 
and put lonners to work 
admlaislering tbem. Checks 
began lo flow Into farmers' 
hands, and the mood 
changed (or the better. 
Elsewhere In the 
DeprcEslatMivsed world, as 
la Gervuay and Italy, the 
open economic system gave 
way to Fascism. In tbe 
United States, the open 
system im-vived. though

Farmers who produced 
certain products — chiefly 
tobacco, peanuts, sugar, and 
dairy products — became so 
dependent on government 
programs thai Ihey resisted 
the trend toward market 
oriuiijtion that has liecome 
evident In the last 15 )ears 

A fair assessment of the 
commodity programs is that 
In (he early years they 
helped to prevent political 
and economic disaster. Bui 
ihey were continued beyond 
their time, and witli this 
extended life came an 
aggravation ol their many 
problems. In the end. con-

during the last two weeks of 
school. I'm putting it on my 
list anyway. Not only was It 
the best film of the summer. 
It is the best film of the year

chanting film apart is the

"Blue Thunder" is another

"War Games" it Is a good 
thriller. Though the 
characters aren't as well

are still believable. The film

By WALTER EH VINS 

Lee DeTurk. a veteran 
baseball coach of 12 year? In 
the high school radu, will 
takeover Ihisfallaacoachol 
Ihe Mastodons as Ihe team 
approaches its second year 
In NCAA Division II. 

DeTurk, 41, comes to 
IPFW from Wayne High 
School, where he founded Ihe 
baseball program in 1972. He 
compiled a winning record of 
175-132-3 during his reign at 
Woyno with a season high of 
23 wins In 1978. DeTurk's 
teams also captured four 
sectional lilies. 

One of DeTurk's out- 
standing high school ball 
layers was Steve Reed, a 
number one draft pick of the 



DeTurk's reasons for 
taking the IPFW Job is based 
on optimism. 'With IPFW 
going into NCAA Division II, 
1 feel that starting somelhlng 
new Is a challenge With 
IPFW'a new facilities, and 
the desire to provide a good 
baseball program. 1 fell It 
was a good opportunity to get 
In and help a new program 
grow." DeTurk said. 

DeTurk, who will remain a 
teacher at Wayne, says be 
doesn'l foresee any condicla 
being a high school teacher 



must if DeTuik is to develop 
a compelilive team. "The 
Tint year ol recruiting for 
Ihe team will bo somewhat 
difriculL I have only had the 
opportunity since Ihe 
beginning of August to go oul 
and present myseV olflclslly 
as head baseball coach al 

years, recruiting should be a 
little easier, because I know 
a lol of the high school 

players "
