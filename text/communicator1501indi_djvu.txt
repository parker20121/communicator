Aid available 
if eligible 



By JIM CHAPMAN 
Editor-in-Chief 

If eligible, students can still 
receive financial aid — Pell 
Grants or Guaranteed Student 
Loans — for the 198344 school 
year, said Mark Franke, director 
of financial aid at IPFW. 

Pell Grants, which are 
awarded to students on the basis 
of need by the federal govern- 
ment, are the most restrictive 
forms of aid, Franke said. The 
government decides if students 
are eligible, and IPFW verifies 
their records. If eligible, students 
receive money from IPFW, 
which is reimbursed by the 
government, Franke said 

When asking for a Guaranteed 
Student Loan, students should 
make sure their banks approve it 
before IPFW certifies eligibility 
based on need. Some banks 
"have their own criteria" and 
may not loan the money even 
though IPFW approves 
eligibility, Franke said 

After IPFW and the student's 
bank approves the loan, the state 
must approve it, Franke said 

"We expect to have over $5 
million in total aid committed 
this year," Franke said. "Last 
year, we had about $4.8 million. 
We're up in the number of 
students applying and the 
number of students who are 



eligible. It's hard, however, to 
determine the exact number 
because of registration." 

To receive financial aid for the 
1984-85 school year, students 
should turn their applications 
into the financial aid office by 
March 1, 1984, Franke said. 

This deadline gives the 
financial aid office time to 
determine which students are 
eligible for aid It is also the 
state's deadline, Franke said. 

"It still comes down to that 
someone has to be told no, but we 
feel we've done the best Job in 
targeting the money to the most 
needy students," he said. 

Besides Guaranteed Student 
Loans, students can receive 
National Direct Student Loans, 
which are given by the university 
and more restrictive. The higher 
education award, which is also 
based on need, is a grant 
awarded by the state, he said. 

About seven percent of 
financial aid given at IPFW 
comes from scholarships based 
on grade point averages, Franke 
said. 

"There are a number of 
scholarships from outside 
organizations," be said. 

Students whose fathers are 
dead or disabled for a war- 
related reason are eligible for a 
reduced tuition, Franke said. 



Harris sees big 
things for students' 
government 



By MIKE ROEGER 
Managing Editor 

Tom Harris, student body 
president, used the words "fired 
up," to describe the student 
government. 

"We have a new slate of 
people," Harris said, "and 
they're all fired up about 
working " 

Harris said there are several 
areas the two arms of student 
government, the senate and 
Student Union Board of Gover- 
nors (SUBOG) will get involved. 

Among the areas the Senate 
will be involved in are: a con- 
tinued look at parking; looking 
into pluses and minuses on 
grades (B+. CO; the honors 
program; teacher evaluations; 
and the student life survey 
conducted last spring. 

"We're trying to find out if 
there is some way to evaluate a 
teacher," Harris said, "then put 
it in some type of pamphlet so 
students can see what other 
students think about a par- 
ticular teacher. We have to make 
sure it's credible and pretty 
reliable for the student." 

A problem students complain 
about at the beginning of every 
semester is parking. He said the 
senate will look into the 
possibility of adding B spaces. 




A student sits against a rock In the Geogarden, while another reads a plaque with a description of 



Geogarden at IPFW 



"One of the senators believe 
there isn't a problem," Harris 
said. "Wehave added parking." 

Harris said SUBOG's plans 
include: continuing the film 
series it began last spring; a ski 
trip to Steamboat Springs, Colo.; 
during Christmas break; a 
welcome back party; and an 
Oktoberfest during the first part 
of October. 

"We're shooting for more 
recent movies," he said 

One of the things Harris 
campaigned for was better 
communication between the 
government and the student 
body. 

"I can feel it changing, "Harris 
said. "More people are interested 
in the organizations. We're going 
to do things for the older student 
who doesn't attend our ac- 
tivities." 

Harris said he will make 
himself available to anyone in- 
terested in how the $20 student 
activity fee is spent. The student 
government office is located in 
suite 225 of the Walb Memorial 
Union. 

Harris also said there are 
openings in both the senate and 
SUBOG. Any student interested 
must be enrolled in six credit 
hours and have a C average.

A new feature at IPFW this 
year is the geogarden, located 
between Neff and Kettler halls. 
The brainchild of Dr. Dipak K 
Chowdhury, the geogarden is 
composed of several large 
boulders representing various 
rock types. 

Chowdhury, associate 
professor of geology and chair of 
the IPFW department of earth 
and space sciences, said he first 
had the idea for the geogarden a 
little over a year ago. At that 
time, special trailers known as 
trams (temporary removable 
office modules) held the space 
now occupied by the garden. 
According to physical plant 
director Don Katter, the troms 
were eliminated when their 
functions were moved to other 
buildings on campus. Original 
plans had called for a garden to 
replace the troms. Chowdhury 
wondered if it could be made into 
a special kind of garden to benefit 
his department and the campus. 



"We had been taking students 
various places to show them 
different rock types," said 
Chowdhury. "But there really 
isn't much variety in the rocks in 
this area." 

So, Chowdhury wrote a letter to 
IPFW Chancellor Joseph Giusti, 
and his cabinet. To his surprise, 
the proposal for the garden was 
accepted. 

"Because of money, I did not 
think the idea would be caught 
up," he said. "But the cabinet 
endorsed it and the earth and 
space sciences department was 
receptive." 

As it turned out, the cost of the 
geogarden was considerably 
lessened by free help from both 
quarries and geology students. 
Quarry managers helped collect 
the rocks and ship them to IPFW 
free of charge. Students then 
washed the rocks to get rid of any 
excess dirt. 



these rocks were originally in 
northern Canada. Then the 
glaciers came and bulldozed 
them here for us to gather." 

Katter said the physical plant 
worked with Karen Byrri, a 
landscape architect from Purdue 
University, West Lafayette, to 
make the garden "pleasing and 
attractive, instead of looking like 
a cemetery." The only condition 
Chowdhury made was that the 
rocks be spaced together ac- 
cording to their group. Each rock 
has a metal plate on it identifying 
its type. Besides the stones, the 
geogarden also has trees and 
shrubbery, benches for weary 
students to rest upon and a 
sundial made of Indiana Oolitic 
limestone. 

Chowdhury said, "I'm very 
thankful to all the people who 
helped It shows a tremendous 
spirit of cooperation between 
everyone." He hopes the 
geogarden will be an asset to 
Students not only at IPFW, but 
from area schools as well.

r— Chancellor Giusti welcomes IPFW's new students 




Chancellor Joseph Giusti discusses the up- 
coming academic year with two IPFW 
students. 



Welcome to Indiana University— Purdue University at 
Fort Wayne for academic year 1983-84. Some of you may be 
here for the first time. Others may he returning after an 
absence of a summer, or a year, or more. For still others, 
this may be the special year in which you will receive your 
diplomas. To all of you I extend warm greetings and my 
best wishes during your time at IPFW. 

The fall registration and orientation period is always a 
busy and exciting timeat the University. The relative lull of 
the summer months has given way to a rush of preparation 
for your arrival. It is a good time for it focuses our energies 
on the primary objective of the University: to provide men 
and women the opportunity to obtain an education of the 
highest quality. 

No doubt, you have come here because you are com- 
mitted to taking advantage of that opportunity in order to 
fulfill your own personal educational goals. Let me assure 
you that the faculty and staff at IPFW are equally com- 
mitted to helping you achieve those goals. 

I would urge you to seek out the services provided by your 
counselors, advisors, and librarians. Above all, get to know 
your faculty. They are very dedicated, highly 
distinguished, and eager to serve as your most important 
resource. 

It is my desire that you enjoy full participation in therich 
environment of university life. More importantly, it is my 
hope that you will come to know at IPFW the deep personal 
satisfaction that lies at the heart of academic endeavor and 
scholastic achievement. 



Classes And Grades 



ATTENDING CLASSES 

1 Is regular class attendance required? 

Ves. Although the method of recording attendance may 
vary from class to class, students are expected to attend 
every class meeting for which they are enrolled. 

2 What should I do if I am unable to attend a class? 
Contact the professor as soon as possible to make 

arrangements for make-up work, if such work is permitted 
The only acceptable excuses for absence are generally 
related to illness and family emergency situations Missing 
classes may seriously reduce the quality of your work and 
result in a poor grade. 

SCHEDULE ADJUSTMENT 

3. Can I drop classes any time 1 want to? 

No. A class cannot be dropped during the last four weeks 
of the semester or thelast two weeks of a summer session. 

4. How do I drop a class? 

First you must get a drop-add form from your advisor. 
During the first 10 weeks of classes, that is all you must 
submit to the registrar's office to officially drop the class. 
During the lllh and 12th weeks, the instructor and your 
academic dean must also approve each class to be dropped, 
and they will do so only in unusual circumstances 

5. Can I add a class to my schedule after I have 
registered? 

Yes. Classes may be added with approval from your ad- 
visor during the first week of classes. The instructor of each 
class must approve additions after that time. 

6 If I want to quit school before classes are over, what do 
I have to do? 

Follow the procedure described for dropping a class. Not 
attending class is not the same as withdrawal. Students who 
do not withdraw properly from a course will receive a 
Failing grade. 

CHANGING MAJORS 

7 Can 1 change my major if I change my mind about what 
I want to study? 

Yes. However you should contact the department that 
offers your new major. A change form will be sent to your 
department and to the registrar's office. 
GRADES 
8. What kind of grades are given credit courses? 
A full list of grades appears in the IPFW Bulletin 
CLASSES AND GRADES: 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
9 What is the "Pass-Fail Option" fora grade in class? 
This is an opportunity for you to take some courses 
without affecting your GPA. However, unsatisfactory work 
may count as an F in your GPA. You must have an ad- 
visor's permission to take a course under this option. 

10. What does it mean if I get a grade of "I", incomplete? 
The grade of "I" means that you could not complete all 

requirements for the course by the end of the semester and 
that you and the instructor have agreed on a method to 
finish those requirements. You must remember that il the 
requirements are not met by the appropriate deadline, that 
incomplete "I" grade will become an "F" (ailing grade 

11. II my grades are bad, will I be able to continue in 

First, all grades that you have earned at this campus will 
be averaged together. Generally, the first semester that 



this average is below the university's or school's 
requirement you will only be placed on probation, which 
means that you will be given an opportunity to raise your 
GPA through additional classes (he next time you enroll. If 
you then continue with poor grades, you will be subject to 
dismissal from the university. 

12, If I am dismissed from the university, will 1 ever be 
permitted to return? 

Generally a student may request to be readmitted to the 
university after being out of school for one semester. Once 
[he readmission is approved, the student will be able to 
enroll but will again be placed on probation until the 
minimum GPA has been achieved. The request for read- 
mission must generally be submitted one mon(h before the 
start of that semester. 

OTHER ACADEMIC 
MATTERS 

13. Under what conditions am I considered to be a student 
in good standing? 

You are considered to be in good standing if not 
dismissed, suspended, dropped from the university without 
being readmitted, or on probation. 

(4. What conditions will deny me the opportunity to 
register for classes? 

The most common reason is that you owe money to the 
university. If you are a student in good standing, other 
reasons would include misconduct and violation of any 
rules adopted and made public by the trustees. 

15 HI feel that I have not been treated fairly with regard 
to a grade I received or an assignment I completed, what 
can I do about it? 

You have the right to request that (he situalion be 
reviewed in a process called a grade appeal. For in- 
formation regarding such procedures, contact the chair of 
the department responsible for teaching the course. 

16. Can I transfer from the Fort Wayne campus to another 

Yes. However, any student who intends to transfer should 
consult with her or his advisor to make proper 
arrangements well in advance of the intended time of 
transfer. 

CLASSES AND GRADES 

17. What is plagiarism? 

Plagiarism is claiming the work of someone else as if it 
were your own original work. Plagiarism usually occurs 
when a student writes a paper, submits a project, or 
prepares a collection and includes quotes or ideas from 
another source without acknowledgement. It is serious 
violation and can lead to disciplinary action. 

NONDISCRIMINATION 
IPFW is an equal access-equal opportunity university. No 
qualified person will be denied admission or employment, 
nor will any student or employee be subjected to 
discriminatory treatment or be excluded from par- 
ticipation in any educational program or activity, on the 
basis of race, religion, color, sex, age, national origin, 
handicap, or status as a disabled or Vietnam Era veteran. 
Further information is available from the affirmative 
action officer(482-5434). 



NON-HARASSMENT 
IPFW strives to maintain the campus as a place where 
students may study and work free of sexual harassment 
and harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, 
national origin or other protected status. Students should be 
aware that harassment in the educational environment is 
unacceptable conduct and will not be condoned. If you have 
a question or a complaint, or want advice, you may talk 
with an official designee or the affirmative action officer 
Their names and phone numbers are available at the in- 
formation desk in Kettler Hall and at the Sweet Shoppe in 
Walb Memorial Union. 



Information in the Student Handbook does not 
supersede olflcial university policies as published in the 
Bulletin and other university publications.

Grade appeals procedure 



The Faculty Senate has passed a uniform grade appeal 
policy for the IPFW campus. Until this document has been 
approved by the Boards of Trustees, the following 
procedure should be followed by a student who has evidence 
or believes that evidence exists to show that an inap- 
propriate grade has been assigned as a result of prejudice, 
caprice, or other improper conditions such as mechanical 
error or assignment of a grade inconsistent with those 
assigned other students. Additionally, a student may 
challenge the reduction of a grade for alleged scholastic 
dishonesty. Further details on grade appeals appear in this 
"Handbook's" discussion of the Indiana University and 
Purdue University Student Conduct Codes. Those 
statements take precedence over statements below. 

In appealing a grade the burden of proof is on (he 
student, except in the case of the alleged academic 
dishonesty, where the instructor must support the 
allegation. 

Informal attempts must be made to resolve grade 
grievances and appeals at the lowest level. If the grievance 
in question cannot be resolved during a conference with 
your instructor, you should speak to the department chair. 
Further appeals will be heard by departmental com- 
mittees or by department chairs. 

Cases not resolved at this level should be referred to the 
school-divisional dean or coordinator. Informal school- 
divisional boards or committees may be established to 
assist deans and coordinators in mediating student 
grievances Unresolved appeals from this level should be 
directed to the vice chancellor and dean of the faculty, who 
may make a final written decision on academic grade 
appeals after ascertaining that all previous means of ap- 
peal have been duly pursued by all parties involved. 



Housing information 

No housing facilities are on the IPFW campus. However, 
the student activities office (482-5616) dispenses housing 
information upon request. There are dormitory facilities 
available for men and women at nearby Concordia 
Theological Seminary, and dormitory-type faculties 
available for women only at the YWCA. The student ac- 
tivities office does not approve or disapprove housing; it 
merely serves as a clearinghouse for housing information. 



Veterans' services 

Your GI Bill education benefits can be used at IPFW. The 
veterans' services office in Ketller 107 will help you apply 
for aid. Usually, the only form you should bring is your 
discharge paper (DD214) . 

Normal processing time for a new application is 45-60 
days. 

The Vet-Rep-On-Campus has information dealing with all 
phases of veterans' benefits, or can refer you to the proper 
community agencies. 



Student 
identification cards 



Each student is issued a picture identification card 
containing his-her name and Social Security Number. The 
student must provide accurate data for inclusion on the 
card, and must show the card to an employee of the 
university upon request. Prior to showing the card, the 
student, if he or she asks, is entitled to be told the reason for 
the request and the employee's name and position, and be 
shown the employee's university identification card. 

The student identification card or card validation is given 
to each student at registration. The replacement fee for lost 
fD cards must be paid at the bursar's office Replacement 
cards are issued from the dean of student services' office, 
SU 1 18, upon showing a paid receipt. 



Assistance 



Trasitional studies 

On the way to a degree, you may need some help. 
Transitional studies can make the critical difference. 

The Developmental Skills Center IKettler 118) offers you 
free help in developing reading, writing, math, and study 
skills (note-taking, textbook-reading, test-taking) on a 
drop-in basis, day and evening, during the school year. 

You can find in the Developmental Skills Center free 
tutorial help in some introductory courses. We also attempt 
to match people needing tutorial help in advanced courses 
with available tutors; financial arrangements for this 
tutoring must be made by students and tutors involved 

Credit course work is offered in individualized sections of 
English W130 (Principles of Composition); Education X150 
(Reading-Learning Techniques I, a reading-study skills 
course; Education XlSl (Reading - Learning Techniques 
II), a study-skills course which emphasizes the application 
of study skills to real college courses; and selected sections 
of Math 111, which maintain a smaller than average 
student -teacher ratio. 

The RAP (Returning Adult Place) program is for 
students coming to the university after being out of school 
for one or more years. RAP features a free monthly 
newsletter on university services and procedures, and 
meetings dedicated to improving students' study or per- 
sonal skills. To gel the newsletter and meeting information, 
stop in Keltler 11B, or call us at 482-5655 



Financial aid 



Financial aid helps students finance their college 
education. The financial aid office (482-5641) uses grants 
and scholarships, loans, and part-time employment, either 
singly or in combination, as the means to provide this 
assistance 



Even though most aid is restricted to full-time un- 
dergraduate students, some programs are available for 
part-time and graduate students. You must file an IPFW 
financial aid application and a Financial Aid Form (FAFi 
to be considered. The applications are reviewed con- 
fidentially by a financial aid counselor, and your aid award 
is based on the calculated need and the availability of funds. 

You are urged to apply by March 1 for the following 
academic year. Applications are accepted after that date, 
but late filers run the risk of encountering fund shortages. 
Also, early application assures that your forms will be 
processed in time for fall registration. 

The financial aid office, located in Kettler 109, has a staff 
of trained counselors to assist with the application process. 
The regular office hours are 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday 
through Thursday, and 8 am. to 5 p.m Friday If 
necessary , appointments may be made for other times.

Welcome from Student Body President 




TOM HARRIS 

On behalf of Students' Government, a sincere welcome to 
all the freshmen on campus and a welcome back to all 
upperclassmen. This year looks like it will be better than 
everallPFW. 

Education can happen as much outside of the classroom 
as inside. Learning leadership roles and communicating 
with groups is very important in developing character. It is 
very important for those of you who have some extra lime 
while at IPFW, regardless of your age or other obligations, 
to be a part of some organization that can benefit you and 
possibly your future career. 1 sincerely hope you will play 
an active role on campus. If you do, you will value your 
IPFW experience even more! 

One of the places that an IPFW student can spend time is 
the Walb Memorial Union. The union has activities, clubs, 
and organizations. On the second floor of the union are the 
offices of the Greek organizations. If you are interested in 
journalism you can be part of the Communicator's staff. If 
you are creative, the arts and crafts room has facilities for 
ceramics, photography, and lapidary. The Campus 
Ministry offices are also on the second floor, offering 
counseling and worship experiences for all. The sweet shop 
and music room are located on the first floor. Relaxing can 
be done at either the pool room, game room, ping pong 
room, or the TV lounge, which are located on the ground 

If you would like to play a part in changing the policies 
that affect you on campus or help to organize concerts and 
other activities, you should join the Students' Government. 
Students' Government is comprised of two branches: 
Student Senate and Student Union Board of Governors. The 
Student Senate is the legislative branch of Students' 
Government. It handles students' complaints, lobbying for 
students and changing university rules and regulations 
concerning students. It meets weekly throughout the year, 
and positions are available for new members. 

The Student Union Board of Governors (SUBOG) is the 
cultural and activity branch of Students' Government. It 
plans the weekly movies held on campus (free for activity 
card holders), parties, dances, trips (including Florida 
Spring break trip and ski trips), lectures, and the Harbor 



Arbor Days held in the spring. Positions are available for 
SUBOG members or executive assistants. SUBOG also 
meets once a week throughout the year. 

Appointments are made by Students' Government to 
various campus committees ranging from bookstore and 
newspaper to traffic and athletic advisory. If you are in- 
terested, please contact Students' Government. Your 
Students' Government communicates to you throughout the 
year through the school newspaper and posters on campus. 

Many of you taking nine credit hours or more might 
question the extra $20.00 Student Services fee which is in 
addition to your other fees. This $20.00 allows you to receive 
an activity card at IPFW. The activity card is used as 
identification to attend athletics and SUBOG-sponsored 
events free or at a reduced rate. PIT (Purdue-Indiana 
Theatre) performances and many other events on campus 
are free! 

Following is a breakdown to explain the allocation of 
funds from the Student Services Fee:

Greeks 



College is a whirlwind or activity. In its 
boundaries lie opportunities leading lo (he 
new and unknown, opportunities to help you 
grow and discover yourself and your 
potential. 

A college education is not just a four-year 
classroom experience, but also a time of 
personal growth and development You'll 
meet all types of people and become exposed 
to all types of lifestyles. You may find much 
you once believed in to be challenged, and 
those things you once took for granted may no 
longer be so easily ignored 

In the middle of this new-found activity, you 
may find yourself lost, with no place lo turn 
for help. 

As a result, you may find it desirable lo 
seek within Ihe university a smaller com- 
munity with which to share. A sorority or 
fraternity provides just this — a base from 
which you can become involved and grow. 

Within Ihe Greek system, a special kind of 
growth lakes place, one that is rarely found in 
any other campus activity. You learn about 
yourself through interactions and close 
friendships in your sorority or fraternity and 
among other Greeks, and can use these ex- 
periences as a foundation for participation in 
the many other facets of university life. 

In no other campus group does a com- 
munity exist for the sole purpose of enhancing 
individuality. 

Through the Greek system, you are given a 
better chance to become involved, to grow, 
and lo develop lasting friendships. 

SCHOLARSHIP is what college is all about. 



Greek organizations encourage members to 
grow intellectually and to achieve academic 
excellence, with the aid of scholarship 
committees and study buddies. 

LEADERSHIP experiences offered by the 
Greek system at IPFW range from chapter 
and Panhellenic Council offices to com- 
mittees and student government. En- 
couragement to gel involved with activities is 
supplied by many of the Greek organizations 
to their members. 

ACTIVITIES for Greeks at IPFW include a 
variety of social events which give many fun- 
filled memories as well as the experience of 
being part of your school's activities. The 
events range from formal to informal dances, I 
fraternity socials, Greek week, and the an- I 
nual Harbor Arbor Day Festival and Three 
Rivers Festival. 

The list of social events and the op- 
portunities to meet new friends and develop 
social awareness and skills are substantial 

PH1LANTHROPICS are an important part 
of Greek life. Each organization has a 
national philanthropy which it supports. 
Members are asked to donate their time for 
service and to help raise money for their 
charily. A successful philanthropic endeavor 
takes dedication, patience and time, but 
rewards every member of the chapter. 

There are two sororities — Pi Beta Phi and 
Delta Gamma — and three fraternities — 
Sigma Phi EpsLlon, Phi Kappa Theta, and 
Delta Sigma Pi. 

Rush information will be available at the 
student services office in Walb Memorial 
Union after August 23

A Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities 
(Indiana University) 



SECTION I. STUDENT RIGHTS 
AND RESPONSIBILITIES 

1 l Students should have accurate and plainly stated 
information relating to the maintenance of acceptable 
academic standing, graduation requirements, and in- 
dividual course objectives and requirements iseethelPFW 
Bulletin) 

1.2 Student records will be maintained in keeping with the 
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, further 
amendments and the HEW guidelines for implementation. 

1 3 In all academic evaluations, and in instances of 
academic discipline, the student has the right to fair and 
impartial treatment. 

1.4 

(a) Students may establish, issue, and distribute — 
consistent with appropriate regulations concerning the 
time, place, and manner of distribution — student-directed 
publications which are in no way published under the 
auspices of the university and are published without any 
financial support from the university. Such regulations 
shall not be designed to restrict student access to these 
publications on university property. 

lb) Student-directed pubhcations which are published 
under university auspices shall be free of censorship. The 
university shall honor this freedom by publicly recognizing 
and protecting the student editors' and managers' right to 
establish editorial policies — within the bounds of 
prevailing legal standards and standards of journalism. 
Specifically, student editors or managers may not be 
suspended or removed in response to pressure by external 
groups disagreeing with their editorial policies. 

1.5 Students have the right to freedom from unlawful 
discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or 
national origin. 

1.6 Students shall have the opportunity to participate in 
the formulation of policy directly affecting students 
through membership on appropriate committees as 
determined by the chancellor and the president of the 
university. 

1.7 Students should be free from illegal searches and 
seizures. 



1.8 



(a) The university will not interfere with the rights of 
students to join associations which promote their common 
interests as students. 

(b) Student organizations holding a fiscal-legal 
relationship with the university are subject to university 
policies, procedures, and regulations pertaining to such 
organizations. 

1.9 

la) Indiana University considers freedom of inquiry and 
discussion essential to a student's educational develop- 
ment. Thus, the university recognizes the right of all 
students to engage in discussion, to exchange thought and 
opinion, and to speak, write, or print freely on any subject, 
in accordance with the guarantees of federal and state 
constitutions. This broad principle is a cornerstone of 
education In a democracy. 

(b) For their programs student groups on the campus 
may freely select persons they wish to invite as guest 
speakers or performers. There are no restrictions on the 
point of view expressed by speakers other than those im- 
posed by national or state law. The jnvitabon to an outside 
speaker does not imply approval or sponsorship of the 
speaker's views by the university nor by the group inviting 
the speaker. 

(c) University facilities are designed to accommodate the 
scheduled activities of the university, to accommodate the 
extracurricular activities of student groups, and to ac- 
commodate visitors and guests of the university. From 
lime to time, as extraordinary requests may justify, 
facilities may be made available for programs of various 
kinds sponsored by non-university groups, especially for 
charitable or civic purposes. 

Id) The university does not make its facilities available 
for fund-raising purposes if the funds are designated to 
enrich an individual or commercial sponsor. 

(e) The university's facilities ordinarily will be 
unavailable for the purpose of providing entertainment of a 
kind that is available in the outside community and is 
competitive with it. 

(f) The university reserves the right to control its 
facilities to assure that events held are compatible with its 
prime purpose of serving the university community by 
making available to it programs that appear to enhance its 
cultural and educational opportunities. 

tg) The university will at all times seek to assure student 
and faculty groups the opportunity to meet and to hear and 
exchange ideas and views, however controversial, but it 
does not license and will not tolerate what is illegal. 

1.10 Students are free to engage in peaceful and orderly 
protest, demonstration, and picketing which does not 
disrupt functions of the university. 

1.11 Students have the right to freely exercise their full 



rights as citizens In this light, the university affirms the 
right to students to exercise their freedoms without 
university interference or fear of university sanction for 
such activity. 

1,12 As members of the academic community, students 
have an obligation to that community and to the preser- 
vation of the academic process. As citizens, students have 
the responsibility to know and obey the laws of the United

integrity of the educational process (e.g., rape, arson, fraud 

(c) The scope of disciplinary sanctions which may be 
imposed on students is as follows: reprimand; disciplinary 
probation; expulsion from university housing; suspension 
or expulsion from the university In addition, academic 
misconduct may be punished by an academic sanction in 
the course in which the misconduct occurred. 

(d) * The process for imposing academic and-or 
disciplinary sanctions shall be designed to accord students 
the guarantees of due process and procedural fairness. 

(c) The university undertakes to ensure equal treatment 
of students subject to disciplinary or academic sanctions, 
and to impose similar sanctions for similar misconduct; 
provided, that the student's prior conduct record, if any, 
will be taken into consideration, 

SECTION II. DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURES 

2.1 Applicability of Procedures 

A student charged with violating university rules of 
student conduct shall be punished only in accordance with 
the following procedures. However, house and hall rules, 



motor vehicle regulations, and procedures under which 
those regulations are enforced, as well as procedure under 
which the university applies its checklist to collect monies, 
continue in force, and adjudication of questions rising under 
ihcm need not comply with the following procedures and do 
not apply to controversies that are amenable to those 
procedures.

penalties described under Section 1, paragraph 1.13 (c) 

17) That many disciplinary penalties imposed under the 
circumstances noted in paragraph 16) above shall be 
subject to further hearing or appeal, but the fact of the

student indicates in writing to the dean, at least five days in 
advance tf the hearing, a desire to open the hearing to the 
futHic. The dean and the presiding officer of the hearing 
commission shall make arrangements satisfactory lo the 
hearing commission to accommodate observers if a 
hearing is to be public, and the hearing commission's 
choice of place and determination of the number of ob- 
servers that can be conveniently accommodated is final; 

1 9 ) that the failure to appear at the hearing will be action

hearing commission, upon diligent inquiry, finds such 
failure lo be inexcusable. 

&lt;b&gt; A hearing shall be conducted before a hearing 
commission, appointed by the chancellor, which shall

other appropriate representative body. 

12) ten or more (acuity members (to be representative of 
the various academic disciplines) to be appointed by the 
chancellor. 

(c) If any vacancy on the hearing list occurs because of 
the failure or refusal of the appropriate authorities to make 
recommendations to fill vacancies, the chancellor may 
make appointments, fill vacancies, or take such other 
action as is necessary to constitute the hearing list or any 
hearing commission. The members of the hearing com-

all rulings necessary for the fair, orderly, and expeditious 
conduct of the hearing. The hearing commission may 
examine all witnesses. When it appears necessary to avoid 
undue hardship or to avoid injustice, the hearing com- 
mission may, in its discretion, grant a reasonable con- 
tinuance of the hearing. The hearing commission shall 
provide a taped transcript of all proceedings, which 
transcript shall be maintained for a period of one year. 

( f ) Copies of all communications pertaining to the alleged 
offense from the dean of student services to a student whose 
case is pending shall be sent to the presiding officer. The

examine witnesses, present other evidence, and may cross- 
examine witnesses. The student charged with an offense

sidered an admission of guilt. The burden of proving that 
the student has committed the offense or offenses as 
charged shall be upon the university.

memorandum stating the reason(s) for believing (he 
decision improper, not later than seven days after the date 
of the written decision of the hearing commission, and the 
dean shall immediately forward the notice to the presiding 
officer of the review board and the student involved (if 
necessary), 

(biThestudent shall be notified by the dean:

based on the record to the review board, or that the 
respective advisor or other counsel may do so; 

&lt;4) that the appeal hearing will be closed to the public. 
unless otherwise requested by the student at least five days 
before the hearing; 

15) that the review board will not accept additional 
evidence, but will consider only the record of the previous 
hearing. 

to The review board shall be composed of a student

a faculty member appointed by the Fort Wayne (Faculty) 
Senate, and an administrative officer appointed by the chief 
administrative officer of a campus. The administrative 
member shall serve as chair. 

(d) The members of the review board shall hold office 
from the first day of the fail semester for a term of one 
year, but they shall complete the review of any case which 
they have begun to consider. No member may serve more 
than two consecutive terms. If any vacancy on the review 
board occurs because of the failure or refusal of ap- 
propriate authorities to make recommendations to fill 
vacancies, the chancellor may make appointments to fill 
vacancies, or take such other action necessary to constitute 
the review board. 

(e) No hearing shall be held unless all members of the 
review board are present. If any member of the review 
board is unable to serve or should excuse himself- herself 
from serving, another review board member shall be ap- 
pointed in accordance with the provisions of sections (c&gt; 
and id) above. 

(f&gt; The presiding officer of Ihe review board, in con- 
sultation with other members, shall maintain necessary 
order and shall make all rulings necessary for the fair, 
orderly, and expeditious conduct of the appeal hearing. 
Decisions by the review board shall be by majority vote 
only. 

&lt;g) The review board will listen to the recorded tape or 
the hearing commission, and then on the basis of (hat and 
oral arguments, written statements, and a review of the 
evidence presented at the appeal hearing, the review board 
must render a decision within twenty days of the hearing 
and may: 

( 1 ) Affirm the original decision which shall be effective 
as of the date specified by the hearing commission. 

(2) Affirm the original decision (and reduce penalty) 
which shall be effective as of Ihe date specified by the 
hearing commission. 

(3) Reverse the decision. 

(4&gt; Disallow the decision and order a new hearing. 

(h) The decision of the review board shall be sent to the 
dean, who shall notify the student and proceed ap- 
propriately. 

2.6 Failure to Appear 

If a student notified to appear before the dean or before a 
hearing commission fails to comply and if the dean or the 
hearing commission reasonably believes that the violation 
occurred as alleged, the dean or the hearing commission 
shall so notify the student and shall propose an appropriate 
sanction by means of written notice. When an extension of 
time appears necessary to avoid undue hardship or in- 
justice, the dean may extend the time to enable a student to 
respond lo an accusation or prepare a defense. 

2.7 Summary Action 

Summary suspension of a student and exclusion from 
university property may be imposed without the hearing 
procedure provided for in this Section, but only by the 
presidenl of the university upon the recommendation of the 
chancellor. The president shall first be satisfied that the 
continued status as a student upon the campus seriously 
threatens harm lo the student or to any olher person or the 
property of the university or of others. A student so 
suspended may be required lo leave the property of the 
university and may be notified that he-she will thereafter be 
treated as a trespasser if he-she returns. A student notified 
of such a suspension may, within ten days after receipt of 
such notice, request a hearing before a hearing com- 
mission, as provided in this Section, to determine whether 
the summary suspension is justified or whether the person 
should be reinstated. 

2.B Whenever disciplinary action is initiated by the dean 
against a student under the age of eighteen, the dean shall 
make reasonable efforts to assure that the parentis) or. 
where applicable, other legal guardian of the student is 
notified that the action is pending. 

SECTION III. ACADEM1CDUE PROCESS 

Preamble 

Faculty and students alike have rights and respon- 
sibilities for learning, teaching, and scholarship within Ihe 
entire university community. Academic functions are 
characterized by reasoned discourse, intellectual honesty, 
mutual respect, and openness lo constructive change. In- 
dividuals must remain active in avoiding violations of 
academic ethics. 

3.1 Definitions of Academic Misconduct. Student 
Misconduct 

(a) Cheating — Dishonesty of any kind with respect to 
examinations, course assignments, alteration of records, or 
illegal possession of examinations shall be considered 
cheating. 

It is the responsibility of the student not only to abstain 



from cheating but, in addition, to guard against making it 
possible for others to cheat. Any student who helps another 
student to cheat is as guilty of cheating as the student he or 
she assists The student should also do everything possible 
to induce respect for the examining process and for honesty 
in the performanceof assigned tasks in or out of class. 

(b) Plagiarism — Honesty requires that any ideas or 
materials taken from another source for either written or 
oral use must be fully acknowledged. Offering the work of 
someone else as one's own is plagiarism. The language or 
ideas thus taken from another may range from isolated 
formulas, sentences, or paragraphs to entire articles copied 
from books, periodicals, speeches, or the writings of other 
students. The offering of materials assembled or collected 
by others in the form of projects or collections without 
acknowledgment also is considered plagiarism. Any 
student who fails to give credit for ideas or materials that 
he-she takes from another source is guilty of plagiarism. 

3.2 Faculty Responsibilities 

The faculty and the trustees of Indiana University have 
affirmed specific responsibilities of academic appointees. 
These responsibilities are contained in (he Code of 
Academic Ethics which is included in the Indiana 
University Academic Handbook. The Code of Academic 
Ethics also provides procedures for enforcement of these 
responsibilities. These responsibilities include, among 
others: 

(1) A teacher will maintain a clear connection between 
the advance description and the conduct and content of 
each course presented to ensure efficient subject selection 
by students. 

(2) A teacher will clearly stale the course goals and will 
inform students of testing and grading systems; moreover, 
these systems should be intellectually justifiable and 
consistent with the rules and regulations of the academic 
division 

(3) A teacher will plan and regulate class time with an 
awareness of its value for every student and will meet 
classes regularly. 

(4) A teacher will remain available to students and will 
announce and keep liberal office hours at hours convenient 
to students. 

151 A teacher will strive to develop among students 
respect for others and their opinions by demonstrating his 
or her own respect for each student as an individual 

(6) A teacher will strive to generate a proper respect for 
an understanding of academic freedom by students. At the 
same time a teacher will emphasize high standards and 
strive to protect students from irrelevant and trivial in- 
terruptions or diversions. 

(7) Since letters of evaluation written by a teacher may 
be uniquely important documents in both the academic and 
post-university life of a student, each teacher will strive to 
make such letters both candid and fair. 

3.3 Due Process for Academic Misconduct 
ta) Student Misconduct 

IDA faculty member who has evidence that a student is 
guilty of cheating or plagiarism shall initiate the process of 
determining the students guilt or innocence. 

(2) No penalty shall be imposed until the student has been 
informed of the charge and of the evidence upon which it is 
based and has been given an opportunity to present his 
defense. 

(3) If the faculty member finds Ihe student guilty, he-she 
will assess a penalty within the class and shall promptly 
report the case in writing to the department chair and the 
academic head of Ihe school or division. The penalty shall 
be in accordance with 3.4. Ihe Actions section of Academic 
Due Process 

1 4 1 If the faculty member and the student cannot agree on 
Ihe facts pertaining lo the charge, or if a student wishes to 
appeal a penalty, the issue may be taken to the department 
chair. Each party will present his-her case lo the chair who 
shall then call a meeting of all involved parlies. If the issue 
is not resolved in the meeting with Ihe chair, Ihen either 
parly may appeal the decision lo the academic head of the 
school or division and the decision of the academic head lo 
ihe dean of the faculty who shall convene an ad-hoc all- 
campus joint faculty and student academic review board 
from the appropriate academic disciplines, consisting of 
three faculty members appointed by the faculty Senate and 
two students appointed by the student body president. 

lb) If a student believes that a faculty member has 
violated the Code of Academic Ethics, the student may 
initiate a complaint in accordance with the "Enforcement 
Procedures" specified in the Code of Academic Ethics. 
Such complaints should be brought to the attention of an 
appropriate chair or dean, or to the dean of the faculty or a 
deputy; Ihe dean of the faculty shall provide for con- 
fidential representations regarding such violations. 

3.4 Actions 

(a) A penalty affecting a student's grade in a course may 
be imposed by the faculty member in whos^ course ihe 
offense occurred. The faculty member is responsible for 
making proper notification to the department chair con- 
cerned and to Ihe academic head of the school or division, 
who shall report the action laken to the dean of student 
services for inclusion in a confidential file designed to

AUGUST 11,1983— THESTUDENTS' HANDBOOK — PAGE17 



(Continued from page 16) 
provide a record lhat will develop information concerning 
students who have repeated offenses. For cases of repeated 
violation, the dean, after appropriate review with the dean 
of the faculty, may initiate disciplinary action. 

(b) In cases of student academic misconduct, the 
following actions are recommended:

(Purdue Univ.) 

"Disciplinary probation" means a probationary student 
status imposed for a limited time as a result of an official 
determination of misconduct. In the event the student is 
found guilty (under the procedures set forth in these 
regulations) of subsequent charges of misconduct com- 
mitted during the period of disciplinary probation, records 
of such disciplinary probations shall be taken into con- 
sideration in determining the disciplinary penalty, if any, to 
be imposed or the administrative action, if any, to be taken 
because of such subsequent misconduct. 

"Probated suspension" means conditional continuation 
of student status for a limited and defined period of time. 
The student is permitted to retain student status upon the 
condition that the student does not further violate any 
subsection or Section B-2 that would normally result in a 
disciplinary penalty during the time probated suspension is 
in effect. If, during the period of probated suspension, the 
student is found guilty of an additional violation of Section 
B-2 after a hearing, suspension may become immediately 
effective and may be extended for a longer period of time 
than the period of probated suspension originally assigned. 

"Suspension" means termination of student status for a 
limited lime, generally without grades; however, in cases 
such as academic dishonesty, a directed grade for a par- 
ticular course may be appropriate. 

"Expulsion" means permanent termination of student 
status, generally without grades, however, in cases such as 
academic dishonesty, a directed grade for a particular 
course may be appropriate. 

B. Student Conduct 

1. General. Students are expected and required to abide 
by the laws of the State of Indiana and of the United Slates 
and the rules and regulations of Purdue University, to 
conduct themselves in accordance with accepted standards 
of social behavior, to respect the rights of others, and to 
refrain from any conduct which tends to obstruct the work 
of the university or to be injurious to the welfare of the 
university. A student who violates these general standards 
of conduct may be subject to administrative actions (as 
defined in Section AS). If the violation falls within one of 
the categories of misconduct listed in Section B-2, the 
student may also be subject to disciplinary penaliies las 
defined in Section A-S&gt;. No disciplinary penalty may be 
imposed except for misconduct covered by one of the 
categories listed in Section B-2. 

2. Misconduct Subject to Disciplinary Penalties. The 
following actions constitute misconduct for which students 
may be subject to administrative action or disciplinary 
penalties, a. Dishonesty in connection with any University 
activity. Cheating, plagiarism, or knowingly furnishing 
false information to the university are examples of 
dishonesty. 

The commitment of the acts of cheating, lying, stealing, 
and deceit in any of their diverse forms ( such as the use of 
ghost-written papers, the use of substitutes for taking 
examinations, the use or illegal cribs, plagiarism, and 
copying during examinations) is dishonest and must not be 
tolerated. Moreover, knowingly to aid and abet, directly or 
indirectly, other parties in committing dishonest acls is in 
itself dishonesL 

b. Forgery, alteration, or the unauthorized use of 
university documents, records or identification. 

c. Obstruction ot disruption of any university activity (as 
denned in Seclion A-S) or inciting, aiding, or encouraging 
other persons to engage in such conduct. II substantial 
obstruction or disruption is threatened or occurs, the 
president, or a designee, may issue a disciplinary 
suspension warning. The minimum disciplinary penalty tor 
violation of this subsection during the period of such war- 
ning shall be suspension for the remainder of Ihe semester 
(or summer session) during which the offense occurred and 
for the next full academic semester and any intervening 
summer session thereafter. However, a more severe 
disciplinary penally may be imposed. 

d. Physical abuse of any person or conduct which 
threatens or endangers the health or safety of any olher 
person, whether or not such conduct occurs on university 
property. 

e. Theft, attempted theft, or damage of or lo property of 
the university or of a member of the university community 
or campus visitor. 



f. Unaulhroized entry, or use. or occupancy of university 
facilities. 

g. Violation of any university rule governing student 
organizations, or the use of university property (including 
the time, place, and manner of meetings or demonstrations 
on university property), or of any other university rule 
which is reasonably related to the orderly operation of the 
university; provided, however, that no disciplinary penalty 
shall be imposed in any such case unless it is shown that the 
accused student knew, or, in the exercise of reasonable 
care, should have known, of the rule in question. 

h. Use, possession, or distribution of narcotics or 
dangerous drugs, except as expressly permitted by law. 
i. Lewd, indecent, or obscene conduct or expression on 
university property. 

j. Failure to comply with directions of university officials 
acting in the performance of their duties. 

k. Any conduct which substantially threatens or in- 
terferes with lhe maintenance of appropriate order and 
discipline in the operation of the university, or any conduct 
on university property or in connection with a university 
activity which invades the rights of others. 

3. Demonstrations. Any individual or group activity or 
conduct, apparently intended to call attention to the par- 
ticipants' point of view on some issues, is not of itself 
misconduct. Demonstrations which do not involve conduct 
beyond the scope of constitutionally -protected rights of free 
speech and assembly are. of course, permissible. However, 
conduct which is otherwise improper can not be justified 
merely because it occurs in the context of a demonstration. 
Demonslra lions which involve violations of any subsection 
of Section B-2, will not be permitted. A student will be 
charged with misconduct for any individual misconduct 
committed by the student in the course of a demonstration. 

5. Status During Disciplinary Proceedings. Except where 
summary action is taken as provided in Section C-7, the 
status of a student charged with misconduct shall not be 
affected pending the final disposition of charges, provided, 
however, lhat no diploma shall be given and no grades, 
academic credit, or degree shall be awarded to a student 
against whom charges are pending for which a disciplinary 
penalty may be imposed. The effective date of any 
disciplinary penalty shall be a date established by the final 
adjudicating body (the dean's office of the campus appeals 
board! In case of suspension or expulsion, the student shall 
not be withdrawn any earlier than the date the notice of 
charges originated or later than the effective date 
established by lhe final adjudicating body. 

6. Misconduct Subject to Other Penalties. As provided in 
Chapter 273 of the 1969 Acts of the Indiana General 
Assembly, misconduct which constitutes a violation of 
these rules and regulations may be punished after deter- 
mination of guilt by the procedures herein provided without 
regard to whether such misconduct also constitutes an 
offense under the criminal laws of any state or of the United 
Stales of whether such conduct might result in civil liability 
of the violator to other persons. 

C Procedures in Student Misconduct Cases 

I. Disciplinary and Administrative Action Proceedings. 
General. 

a. The procedures hereby established shall be followed in 
all cases in which the university institutes disciplinary 
proceedings or administrative action proceedings against 
students for violations of the rules of student conduct set 
forth in Section B. These procedures shall not apply to or 
affect the jurisdiction or procedures eslabbshed by student 
organizations or similar organizations. 

b. Disciplinary proceedings are those proceedings 
initiated by the issuance of a notice of charges and are 
governed by the provisions of Seclion C-l lo 7 inclusive. The 
term "disciplinary proceedings" does not include ad- 
ministrative action proceedings. 

c Administrative action proceedings are informal in- 
vestigations conducted by the dean's office with a view to 
possible administrative action. Administrative action may 
be taken by the dean's office without instituting disciplinary 
proceedings and such action shall be final and not subject 
lo further hearing or appeal. A disciplinary penalty may not 
be imposed without first instituting disciplinary 
proceedings pursuant to Section C-2. If the dean's office 
confers with the student in the course of administrative 



PAGE 18 - THE STUDENTS' HANDBOOK — AUGUST 11. 1983 

(Continued from page 17) 
action proceedings, no statement made by the student 
during such conference shall be used against the student in 
any disciplinary proceedings which may thereafter be 
instituted. 

2. Institution of Disciplinary Proceedings. 

a. Disciplinary proceedings shall be instituted by the 
dean's office by the issuance of notice of charges. 

b. The notice of charges (and all other written notices 
given to students against whom disciplinary proceedings 
are initiated) shall be delivered by the most effective 
method lo the student's address as it then appears on the 
official records of the university. The notice shall inform 
the student of the rule or regulation allegedly violated, also 
fairly inform the student of the reported circumstances of 
the alleged violation, and request the student to appear in 
the dean's office for a hearing on the incident. A copy of 
these regulations shall accompany each notice of charges. 
A copy of the notice of charges may be sent to the parent or 
guardian of the student if the student is dependent as 
defined in Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 

3. Failure lo Respond to Charges. If the notice of charges 
requests the student to appear in the dean's office and the 
student fails or refuses to appear, the dean's office may, 
after such investigation as it may deem necessary, 
dismiss the charges, take administrative action, or im- 
pose a disciplinary penalty. If the dean's office lakes ad- 
ministrative action, it shall notify the student in writing of 
such action, and such action shall not be subject to further 
hearing or appeal. If the dean's office imposes a 
disciplinary penalty, it shall notify the student in writing of 
such action, and the student may appeal such action to the 
campus appeals board as provided in Section C-6 When it 
appears necessary to avoid undue hardship or lo avoid 
injustice, the dean's office may extend the time to enable a 
student to respond lo Ihe charges. 

A. Response lo Charges. 

a. If the student appears in response to the notice of 
charges for the purpose of a hearing of the alleged violation 
as provided in Section C-5, the dean's office shall advise the 
student as fully as possible of the facts concerning the 
alleged charges and Ihe names and addresses of witnesses 
then known to the dean's office. The student shall also be 
advised that no response is required, thai any statement 
made by the student may be used against the student, that if 
the student remains silent, thai silence will nol be taken as 
an admission against the student, and that the student may 
advise the dean's office of any witnesses or evidence sup- 



porting the student's position. The dean's office shall also 
advise the student thai if any new information is discovered 
during an investigation subsequent to the hearing, the 
student will have an opportunity lo respond to such in- 
formation. 

b. Afler the hearing with Ihe student and such further 
investigation as the dean's office deems necessary, the 
dean's office shall proceed as follows: 

1. If the dean's office determines that the violation 
alleged is not supported by the evidence, the charges shall 
be dismissed and the student notified. 

2. If the dean's office is satisfied that the violation oc- 
curred as alleged, but lhat no disciplinary penally shall be 
imposed, the dean's office may take administrative action 
and nolify the student. Such action by the dean's office shall 
be final and not subject to further hearing or appeal. 

3. If the dean's office is satisfied that the violation oc- 
curred as alleged and that a disciplinary penally should be 
imposed, the dean's office shall so notify the student. 

5. Conduct of Hearing. Each hearing shall be conducted 
before one or more members of the dean of students office 
staff and, although the hearing is informal in nature, it shall 
provide the student certain procedural safeguards. 

The student shall be given the opportunity to hear the 
evidence against him-her, rebut statements made by 
witnesses, present witnesses, evidence, or any relevant 
information in the student's own behalf. The student shall 
also be given the opportunity to respond to any new in- 
formation gathered during an investigation subsequent to 
Ihe hearing. The dean of student's office has the burden of 
proving Ihe student guilty of Ihe alleged violation, and the 
decision of the dean's office shall be based solely on in- 
formation introduced at the hearing and obtained during 
subsequent investigations. 

No person other than the sludent shall be present during 
the discussion between the dean's office and Ihe student 
except by mutual agreement of Ihe dean's office and the 
student. 

Within five days following the conclusion of the hearing 
and subsequent investigation, the dean's office shall notify 
the student, in writing, of what action it will take. The 
decision letter shall contain a finding as to the guilt or in- 
nocence of the student and a brief statement of the reasons 
for ihe decision. Any disciplinary penalty imposed or ad- 
ministrative action taken is subject to the provisions of 
Section B-i of this regulation and any other university rule, 
regulation, or directive then existing. 

6. Appeal of the Dean's Office Decision. The sludent may 
appeal the decision of the dean's office lo the campus ap- 



peals board. An appeal may be initiated by filing a notice of 
appeal with the campus appeals board through the dean's 
office or with the chair of the campus appeals board. Such 
an appeal must be filed within seven days of the date on 
the letter from the dean's office containing the decision, and 
the appeal must be personally signed by the student. The 
dean's office will provide the campus appeals board with a 
copy of Ihe notice of charges and the decision letter sent to 
the student. The university will be represented at the ap- 
peal hearing by the dean's office or other appointed 
representative. 

7. Summary Action. Summary disciplinary action by way 
of temporary suspension and exclusion from university 
property may be taken against a student charged with 
misconduct without the issuance of a notice of charges and 
without the procedures prescribed in Section C on the 
following conditions; Summary action shall be taken only 
by the president of Ihe university or by an authorized vice 
president of (he university, and only after the student shall 
have been given an opportunity to be heard if such 
procedure is practical and feasible under the cir- 
cumstances. Summary action shall be laken only if the 
president or vice president is satisfied that the continued 
presence of the student on university property threatens 
harm to the student or to any others. Whenever summary 
action is taken under this Section C-7, Ihe procedures 
provided for in Section C for hearing and appeal shall be 
expedited so far as possible in order to shorten the period of 
summary action. 

D. The Campus Appeals Board 

1. Organization and Jurisdiction. 

A campus Appeals board shall be established for each 
campus of Ihe university. 

2. Conduct of Appeal 

a. The campus appeals board may prescribe regulations 
governing the conduct of the appeals not inconsistent with 
these regulations. The appeal hearing shall be open to (he 
public or closed as the campus appeals board shall deter- 
mine. If a hearing is to be open to the public, the campus 
appeals board may change the place of hearing, and its

Arts and crafts room 

The arts and crafts room is a unique feature of the IPFW 
campus. Located in Walb Memorial Union 214 and 21B it 
offers a variety of resources: a darkroom for black-and- 
white photography, weaving looms, lapidary and 
silkscreening equipment, a large ceramics area that in- 
cludes potter's wheels and an electric kiln, a drawing and 
painting area, and a woodworking shop which houses 
motorized saws, a drill press, and other basic equipment for 
carpentry. All students, faculty, staff, and alumni of IPFW 
are invited to use the room and its facilities, free of charge. 

The room is designed as a comfortable setting for those 
wishing to take a break from the everyday stress of classes, 
studies, and-or work. It also provides an accessible place 
for students to work on their school-related projects such as 
graphs, posters, illustrations, etc. A creative atmosphere is 
offered for those wanting to learn about art, yet who never 
before had such a wide range of facilities at their disposal. 

Although the arts and crafts room provides much of the 
necessary equipment, those wishing to use the facilities 
must furnish the consumable materials For example, 
those interested in ceramics must purchase clay and 
glazes. Those who want to print photographs must buy 
photographic paper and chemicals Lockers, in the hallway 
adjacent to the craft room, are recommended for personal 
art-supply storage. A list of local art-supply stores is on 
display in the crafts room. 

During an average week, approximately 50-75 people use 
the roam. The time between Thanksgiving and Christmas is 
the busiest, since many students and staff make use of the 
facilities for gifts. Here's just a sampling of what has come 
out of the crafts room: stereo speakers, silk-screened 
Christmas cards, a silver ring and bracelet set, matching 
end tables, a ceramic dinnerware set, silk-screened T- 
shirls, loom-woven wool scarves, and life-sized Indian-chief 
sculpture. 

The crafts room is physically accessible to the disabled, 
and the staff believes art to be an important and vital outlet 
for them. Since each student receives individual attention, 
each is encouraged to work at her or his own level of 
achievement. Blind students have made beautiful ceramic 
and sculpture pieces; paraplegics have been involved in 
woodworking and photography.

Comic books: No longer province^pf children 



ByKIMMETZGER 
Copy Editor 
Before some people read very 
far into this column, they're 
going to mutter, "What is this 
doing in The Communicator? It's 
about comic books! They're kids' 
stuff!" 

A lot of people feel that way 
about comic books. Popular 
opinion has decreed comics are 
reading matter with crudely 
drawn pictures, fit for, roughly, 
ages eight to 12. The general 
public is aware some adults also 
read them, but feel it's no doubt a 
small percentage of the audience- 
While this may have been the 
case at one time, however, that 
time is long past. A recent survey 
conducted by The Comics 
Buyer's Guide, a weekly 
newspaper for comic collectors 
with a circulation of over 9,000 
subscribers, found the average 
age of comic book readers to be 
not in the early teens, as most 
people think, but between 25 and 
30. 

Why is the age for comic book 
fans now so heavily in the adult 
years? Simply, comic books 
themselves have become much 
more sophisticated and appeal to 
mature tastes, in spite of their

tendency to almost solely 
chronicle the adventures of 
crime fighting super-heroes. 

This trend began in the mid- 
1960's when Stan Lee, then the 
editor and main writer for 
Marvel Comics (he's now the 
publisher), decided to try putting 
out a line of comics both kids and 
adults could enjoy. So he began 
writing stories of heroes who, 



despite their powers, had 
decidedly human problems. 

Lee created The Fantastic 
Four, a group of heroes who 
fought among themselves almost 
as frequently as they battled the 
villains; The Incredible Hulk, the 
saga of a man living in constant 
fear of his violent, inhumanly 
powerful alter-ego; and, above 
all, Spider-Man, a character who 
could just barely handle a normal 
life, let alone one complicated by 
the addition of super-powers. 

Though some may quarrel over 
how mature Lee's stories ac- 
tually were, they worked 
nonetheless. Marvel began to 
get letters of praise from 
businessmen, college professors 
and even much notables as Tgm. 
("The Right Stuff") Wolfe and 
Ken ("One Flew Over the 
Cuckoo's Nest") Kesey. Marvel's 
success was also helped by the 
popularity of the "Batman" TV 
show, which helped to make 
comic book reading an "in 
thing," for both teenagers and 
adults. 

Many young readers continue 
to follow these and other comics, 
(particularly those of Marvel's 



Committee formed 



rPFW Chancellor Joseph Giusti 
has appointed John Hobson to 
form a committee to coordinate 
activities celebrating DPFW'S 
20 th anniversary. 

Activities will be planned 
during the entire calendar year of 
1984, but Hobson. director of 
Alumni Activities, said the 
celebration won't be as big as the 
25 th anniversary celebration. 
"We don't want this one to pass 
by. however, "he said. 

The committee plans to have a 
logo developed to be printed on 
university brochures and 
publications, and is considering 
entering a parade in next year's 
Three Rivers Festival. 

"1 think the anniversary helps 
us learn more about our history," 



said Hobson, who, as a freshman, 
walked into Kettler Hall on the 
first day of classes in 1964. 

Committee members are 
Pauline Hunsberger, assistant 
and reference librarian; Tom

main competitor, DC) well into 
(heir adult years. It is this 
generation, in fact, which is now 
comic books most powerful (and 
demanding) audience today. 
Some of those readers are now 
even drawing and writing the 
current comic books. 

This is another factor in the 
maturation of the comic book. 
These readers-turned- writers 
know what their audience wants 
in terms of subject matter and 
can give it to them. Hence, topics 
in comics today have become 
more adult in nature. The super- 
heroes have lives that seem more 
realistic than they ever have 
before. The struggle of these

characters to be accepted in spite 
of the powers that make them 
different has struck a chord in a 
society where acceptance has 
become so important. If the 
comics can move away from the 
super-heroes someday, they may 
finally find themselves taken 
more seriously. 

However, as the comics have 
geared themselves towards a 
more adult readership, a 
problem has arisen. The young 
audience of today is abandoning 
comics, to the alarm of the 
companies. Both DC and Marvel 
consider this young audience 
essential to the survival of the 
industry in the future. The feeling 
is a reader not attracted to 
comics as a child never will read 
them. 

With this in mind, efforts are 
being made to publish new lines 
of comics targeted for kids. 
Marvel has two new titles 
planned and is also trying to 
acquire rights to the characters 
of the recently demised Harvey 
Comics (publisher of "Richie 
Rich" and "Casper the Friendly 
Ghost"). DC is also making 
overtures in the same area. 
Whether these efforts will be 
successful remains to be seen. 
But it doens't bode well that 
recent attempts at children's 
comics have been failures. 

No, comic books are no longer 
kids' stuff, no matter how much 
the companies may wish they 
still were. They are now the 
fantasies of adults, including a 
good many college students. For 
this reason, "4-Color Comments"

New coaches hope to continue success 



By REGGIE HAYES 
Sports Editor 

The IPFW athletic department 
is riding the momentum of its 
best year ever, and the athletic 
staff is facing the welcome 
problem of continuing its success 
while competing against more 
NCAA schools than ever before. 

To help in this drive for suc- 
cess, two new coaches, a trainer 
and a sports information director 
will each begin their first full 
year in 1983. 

Mike Kast has been hired to 
coach cross-country and Lee De 
Turk to coach baseball. The 
trainer will be Brad Mishler and 
the new sports information 
director is Kurt Palberg. 



Kast, a lawyer, will be taking 
his first coaching job. He is an 
avid runner who has said most of 
his coaching experience has been 
in individual instruction. Kast 
participates in many long 
distance runs, including the 
Boston Marathon. 

Kast is a member of the College 
of Sports Medicine Association. 
He already has his team getting 
in shape for the upcoming season. 
IPFW cross-country runners 
begin their season on Sept. 3 with 
a home meet against Grace and 
Manchester. Nine meets are 
scheduled through the end of 
October, capped by the NCAA 
RegionalsonOct.29. 

In contrast to Kast's relative 



inexperience in coaching, De 
Turk has an impressive record 
during 12 years at Wayne High 
School. De Turk started the 
baseball program at Wayne in 
1972 and has compiled a 175-132-3 
record, which includes four 
sectional championships. 

The team De Turk inherits at 
IPFW had a school record 12-10 
season last year. The new 
baseball diamond on the north- 
east side of campus has helped 
the program to grow. The athletic 
department hopes the arrival oi 
De Turk will solidify the 
program. A fall schedule is still 
being worked on to complement 
the regular season, which begins 
in March. 



Mishler will have a dual role 
in the athletic department. Along 
with his position as trainer, he 
will be the head equipment 
manager for all sports. Mishler 
recently received his masters 
degree as a certified trainer from 
the University of North Carolina. 

A native of Huntington, 
Indiana, Mishler graduated in 
1981 from Indiana University. He 
will begin his job here at IPFW on 
Aug. 16. 

Although this is the first full 
year at IPFW for Patberg, he 
arrived at IPFW this past spring 
and actually began his duties on 
April 15. As coordinator of sports 
information and promotion, 
Patberg is responsible for media 



contacts, interschool relations 
and special events in athletics 
during the course of the year. 

Patberg graduated from the 
University of Evansville, and 
was previously the director of 
sports promotion at Stetson 
University in DeLand Florida. 

The returning coaches at IPFW 
this year are Arnie Ball in men's 
and women's volleyball; Tim 
Sullivan in men's and women's 
tennis; Terry Stefankiewicz in 
soccer; Karl Zimmerman in golf; 
Tim Russell in men's basketball; 
and Kirk Kavanaugh in women's 
basketball. 

Patberg probably spoke for the 
entire athletic staff when he said, 
"I'm real excited. I think we'll 
haveagrealyear." 



Winning seasons highlight transition year 



By REGGIE HAYES 

Sports Editor 

1982-83 looked to be a year of 
transition for IPFW athletics. It 
marked the school's first year in 
NCAA Division n, so the 
Mastodons could have been 
expected to lake a few lumps 
against the improved com- 
petition. As it turned out, IPFW 
opponents were the ones who 
ended up with bruised egos. 

In the eight sports which can be 
measured in wins and losses, 
seven Mastodon squads emerged 
with winning records. One, the 
women's tennis team, went 
undefeated. 

In cross country and golf, 
which often involve several 
competing teams at one time, 
fPFW's representatives more 
than held their own, taking first 
or second in 10 out of 13 matches. 

Soccer coach Terry 
Stefankiewicz' men finished the 
season last year with an li-fl-i 
record IPFW's fifth straight 
winning season. The Mastodons 
will be playing their first full 
season in Division II, and their 
schedule reflects the tougher " 
competition. Among the teams 
they will be facing this year are 
Notre Dame, DePaul and 
Oakland College, a member of 
the NCAA Division II final four 
last year. 

Stefankiewicz has several top 
performers returning from last 
year's team, including tri- 
captains Tony Davis, Chris 
Bender and Mark Blessing. Ten 
newcomers have been recruited 
to add depth as the Mastodons 
shoot for their sixth straight 
winning season. 

Based on last year's results, 
the men's and women's tennis 
teams also nave much to look 
forward to in the coming season. 
Playing both a fall and spring 
season, the men were 18-7 and the 
women 11-0. The MVPs for the 
two teams were Dan Brogan and 
Babs Spidel. With a stronger 
schedule expected this year, the 
challenge for both teams will be 
to keep up their dominating 
reputations. 

In volleyball, the Mastodons 
should capitalize on experience 
this year, since no players from 
either the men's or women's 
teams were lost to graduation. 
The women finished last season 
at 30-17-1 and were led by co- 
MVPs Conette Saylor and Clara 
Schortgen. 

The prospects for this season 
look promising as coach Arnie 



Ball has recruited seven new 
players. Ball said several of these 
recruits should challenge for 
starting spots. 

The men put together a 9-13 
season with a team composed 
mainly of freshmen and 
sophomores Loren Gebert was 
the MVP and also played in a 
Russian intersquad exhibition 
when the Soviet national team 
appeared at IPFW. Seven 
recruits have also been signed up 
for IPFW men's squad this year. 

Youth was also the key to the 
IPFW golf ieam as freshman 
Kevin Schif fli emerged as the top 
golfer. Schiffli was the medalist 
in almost all of the Mastodons' 
matches and led the team to four 
first place finishes and three 
seconds in nine total contests. 

Cross-country runners enjoyed 
similar success as the team took 
one first and two seconds in an 
abbreviated four-meet schedule. 
With the addition of new head 
coach Mike Kast, another win- 
ning season is expected. 

A new field apparently put new 
life into the IPFW baseball team, 
which doubled its previous 
season's wins with a 12-10 record. 
The team was led by the hard- 
hitting Mike Dull, wholed the 
nation in RBI average for NCAA 
Division II. Dull also had a 
slugging percentage over 1.000. 
This year's hardballers will be 
guided by new coach Lee 
DeTurk, former head coach at 
Wayne High School 

Despite the tine seasons en- 
joyed by all IPFW teams, 
perhaps the biggest surprises 
came in men's and women's 
basketball. 

The men rebounded from a 2-24 
season to a 16-12 record under 
first year coach Tim Russell. The 
16 wins were the most ever by the 
men's teams. The highlight of the 
season was a 54-53 upset of 
Wright State University, which 
later won the Division II National 
championship. 

The Mastodons were led by co- 
MVPs Jeff Hansen and Irv 
Lukens, both of whom return this 
year. In fact, the team has no 
seniors, and, with the addition of 
eight new players, should be even 
stronger than last year. 

The women's team completely 
dominated their opponen's in 
compiling a 17-4 record, its best 
ever At the end of the season, the 
women voted not to have an MVP 
and rightfully so. If one word 
could describe the women's 
team, it was teamwork. The best 



proof of this is that the Mastodons 
were number one in team scoring 
defense in NCAA Division II 
with a 54.0 average. 



Clara Trowbridge was voted 
the most improved player of the 
season and Joan Wenning led the 
team in scoring with a 15.4 



average. In following what 
seemed to be the standard for 
IPFW teams, there were no 
graduating seniors on the 
women's squad
