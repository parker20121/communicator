During the morning, noon and

many classes are ending, lunch hours 
beginning, or weary students heading 
home, students and faculty find 
themselves In traffic jams, sometimes 
walling up to 15 minutes to exit onto 
Coliseum Boulevard. 

Police assistance has been available 
to help facilitate easier exits by 
alternating the flow of cars with the 
changing of the traffic light.

Departments at IPFW can change 
Ihe wording and make up of the

change the course lilies or numbers 
or include new courses without the 
approval of the main campus. 

The bulletin sometimes contains 
errors in information. Hollander 
said most of the mistakes are minor 
and are the fault of Ihe publisher or 
Ihe typesetter. A previous bulletin 
mistakenly listed a maximum

Hollander warns, however, thai 
most terms have a general meaning

students and administration and 
should not be defined because the

Fees high, salary low 



The facullies of Indiana's stale- 
supported universities are among the 
lowest paid in Ihc Midwest. The student 
fees are among Ihe highest in the Mid- 
There seems In be something wrong 
here. 

II the presidents of the slate-supporled 
universities have their way, not only will 
facully salaries increase but student 
Tees will also rise, 

II is lime for the students of IPFW and 
the other campuses of Indiana and 
Purdue universities to stand up and tell 
-them "No." 

Many sludenls are already struggling 
financially to attend college. Why fur- 
Iher burden them? 

W President John Ryan defended Ihe 
lee hike by Idling Ihe III Board of 
Trustees financial aid programs are set 
with tuition increases in mind. The aid 
will help students even if tuition were 



increased between 6 and 8 percent each 
of the next two years, he said. 

We don't buy that reason. 

While many sludenls receive some 
form ol financial aid, not everyone does. 
With an increase in fees, more and mare 
students may be forced to use financial 
aid to pay for college, thus pulling a 
turiher burden on Ihe system. 

It is time for students lo stand up and 
lell them "No." 

Tom Harris. Ihe former student body 
president, has proposed a letter- writing 
campaign lo increase awareness for the 
need of a fine arts facility for IPFW. 
While we have the pens and paper oul for 
letters concerning the fine arts facility, 
why not write anolher letter, telling the 
members of the General Assembly, the 
university presidents, the boards of 
trustees and Gov. Robert Orr lhal tuition 
Is already too high and we can't afford 
another 6 percent increase next fall. 



Hats off to spikers 



In the wake of the IPFW women's 
volleyball season, a tinge of bittersweet 
sentiment hangs in the air. So many 
good things happened and so many large 
strides were made. Yet Ihc squad was 
denied the chance lo continue lo climb to 
new heighls, as il was looked over when 
the NCAA handed out Division II tour- 
nament bids. 

And although Ihis snubbing can lead to 
disappointment and frustration, we 
can't lose scope on whal the team has 
accomplished Ihis season. 

Firsl, ihc team won 35 maiches, 
equalling lasl year's most-ever wins for 
one season. The learn actually improved 
its winning percenlage to .714, up from 
.666 a year ago. 

The Mastodons made visible the 
improvemenl in the caliber of volleyball 
'they played, being competitive with 
•NCAA Division I learns the likes ol Ohio 
jjlale and Memphis State, and actually 
^defeating Florida, Texas (yes, the same 
.Texas synonomous with Longhorns and 
-the Cotlon Bowl I and taking two of three 
■from perennially lough Lewis Univer- 
sity. 

'■' Also, Ihc Mastodons became Ihe first 
;tPFW athletic team ever lo win a 
Championship in Ihe Great Lakes Valley 
; Conference. The tournament bid is 
'somelhing lhat didn't happen — Ihe 
conference championship is something 
■lhat can never be inken away. 

And I hen there is Ihe story of the three 
seniors - Conetle Saylor, Clara 
Schorlgen and Lisa Sheehan — three 
unlikely heroines who ultimately were 
the cornerstones of the team's good 
: fortunes 

The loss of ihcse three athletes will 



leave gaping holes for coach Arnie Ball, 
both on the floor and in the heart. The 
only reason their departure is not 
causing Coach Ball to push the crisis 
button is because of the slew of young 
players who got valuable playing time 
and also were instrumental in Ihe 
team's success. But most importantly, 
Ihey were able to play under ihe three 
seniors, and if the future success 
depends on a Saylor-Schortgen-Sheehan 
bred learn, the outlook is line. 

This year's freshmen will play like 
more than sophomores next year Julie 
Hefty, Carla Gerardot, Dawn Bohnke, 
Kristie Kelly and Sherrie Waters all saw 
considerable action during the course of 
Ihe season and will all be forces lo be 
reckoned with next season. 

And to lop il off, also returning will be 
sophomore Linda Shank, whose 
Howiuer-like spiking ability left op- 
ponent's heads spinning all season long. 
She has two seasons left, and il makes 
one shudder to think of what she will 
accomplish in lhat time. 

So it will be a crossroads for IPFW 
women's volleyball. The program looks 
darn solid and is lough as nails. The 
question is when will people realize and 
appreciate the team's ac- 
complishment? The leam may very 
well be Ihe best-kept secret in all of 
Indiana collegiate athletics. And no 
matler what personnel return to the 
floor next year, as long as Arnie Ball 
paces the sidelines, ihe leam is in good 

We can't allow the frustration of the 
tournament snub to hinder the potential 
progress of whal lies ahead. This year 
the GLVC, next year ... who knows?

Biology department changes graduation requirements 



E SHAFFER 
Chief Reporter 

■ The faculty of the School of Science and Humanities has 
; approved a revision of the requirements (or a biology major 
; proposed to takeef/eetin Ihe 19»5 tall semester. 

; Douglas Wartiog, chairman of the Biology department, 
; uld Ihe revisions will be enforced on all new students In the 
; (all 0(1985 

* "The old students will have (he option of continuing on Ihe 
; old program or switching oxer to the new one." Wartiog 

I According to a bulletin published by the biology deport- 

* ment, students In Ihe present program should be able to 

■ finish under this program However, part-time students and 



others who haven't followed a normal course sequence may 
be involved Ins mature of the old and new curricula to finish 
their degree In biol ogy . 

The revised curriculum will include Biology iimzz, a one 
semester course emphasizing ecology, behavior, and 
diversity of organisms. Biology 133-134, a one semester 
course emphasizing structure and function of plants and 
animals; Biology 233-134, a one semester course em- 
phasizing development, structure and function at the 
cellular level; and Biology Mi-142, a one semester course 
empha siil ng gene tics and molecular biol ogy. 

Other changes in the curriculum are as follows: Biology 
221 replaced by Biology 43&amp;H39; Biology 235 replaced by 
biology S&amp;5; Biology 156 replaced by Biology sS5-iSS; Biology 



430 replaced by Biology 241-242, Biology 435 replaced by 
Biology 533, Biology 524 replaced by Biology 529. 
Entomology 100 replaced by Entomology 306-307; and 
Horticulture 102 replaced by Horticulture 101. 

Wartiog said the changes are designed to do four things. 
First, the new curriculum will increase the amount of credits 
in, and thus emphasize, biochemistry, cellular and 
molecular biology. Secondly, the changes will give students 
more time for taking advanced courses by reducing the 
number of CORE classes. Last, Wartiog said Ihe CORE 
classes will now be team taught to give the students belter 
exposure lo all the faculty members in the biology deparl-

new curriculum will allow students to know marc about

courses for specialization, and give the students a wider

Wartiog said a survey of graduates of IPFW's biology 
department was conducted, and the results showed a desire 
for more cellular biology classes This partially accounts for 
the enhancement of cellular and molecular biology In the

Men use balance 
to top Marauders 

By TAMI RICE 
SUH Writer 

Rebounding from an KWO loss against Kentucky Slate, the 
men'i basketball leomdefcalKlCenlralState Monday night, 
M-J7. 

Against Central State, the Mastodons played a patient 1-2-2 
lonedtfetueand got balanced scoring to Wiethe victory. 

Coach Tim Hiusell said. "We had a balanced situation at 
the beginning of each half Th I a la psychologically Important 
In the early pari of the halves It gave us stability When you 
know you're In the game, you play harder." 

Wllhfive minutes logo In the first half, and the Mastodons 
trailing by two. IPFW attacked Central's defense for 13 
points, holding the Marauders to two. 

"That was basically the ball game." said Russell. 
"Everything else was even" Russell said tut different 
players scored during that stretch. "I point that out because 
we were finding the open man. spreading It around. We were 
playing with much mare intensity and together." 

Guard Mark Cook led the scoring with 1G points Jeff 
Morlan added IS, followed by Willie Brooks wllh 12 and Jelf 
Nanncn with 11. 

"Overall It was s pretty good effort with four 
double figures," said Russell, "We had good balanced 
scoring and that's a nice way to come back from such a 
terrible off or I" 

And thai terrible ellort was IPFW's loss lo Kentucky Stale 
on Nov. 24. 

"We didn't do many things well," said Coach 
didn't play hard, together, or defense. Basically we dl 
anything towln." 

Unlike ihe Central game It was the first five mln 
each half lhat deleatcd the Mastodons. 

"We got beal 29-9 The other 30 minutes wc played 
Russell said. "Once you gel behind you 
very well." 

Jell Fullove and Morlan led the Mastodons with 
points, Cook followed with 6 

"I've got to give Kentucky credit, they're a good team,
