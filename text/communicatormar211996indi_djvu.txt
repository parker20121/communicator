IPSGA violates constitution 



by Cassle Hitler 
Chief Reporter 

The 1996 Indiana Purdue Studcnls 
Govemmeni Association (IPSGA) 
cleciions will not lake place as 
scheduled ai the end of March due lo a 
cons(i(uiional violation on (he part of 
Studcnls Government 

IPSGA's judicial court met Monday. 
March 18, to determine if the Students 
Government was in violation of its consti- 
tution, and after thirty minulcs of delibera- 
tion, decided that it was. The student judi- 
cial court then voted unanimously to 



extend the deadline for petitions as well as 
the actual election in order to bring IPSGA 
inio conformity with its constitutional 
guidelines. 

The actions began last week when a stu- 
dent lodged an informal complaint with 
IPSGA. accusing the association of violat- 
ing its own constitution. According to the 
complaint, IPSGA had failed to provide 
infonnaiion to the student body in regard 
to the proper procedure as well as dead- 
lines for petitioning for candidacy. 

According to the IPSGA conslilution. 
"the eleaion board must actively advertise 
campus-wide, all positions available. 



where petitions may be obtained, and the 
deadline for turning in completed peti- 
tions." The IPSGA constitution also states 
that the election board must "publicise 
three weeks preceding the initiation of the 
candidate election campaign starting date " 

The IPSGA election board posted flyers 
providing information about die election 
itself, however, it failed to inform the siu- 
dent body as to how to petition for candi- 
dacy. The election board is comprised of 
students appointed by Student Body 
President Kevin Eads and approved by the 
Student Senate 

The deadline for petitions was Friday, 



March 15, at 5 p.m. Because the election 
board failed to post any information about 
the petitions — where they could be 
obtained, bow many signatures were 
required and the official deadline submis- 
sion of petitions — nonincumbent students 
interested in running for IPSGA found it 
difficult to receive necessary information. 

At the time the petitions were due. the 
only ones received were those from incum- 
bent IPSGA members At press time on 
Wednesday, those incumbent IPSGA 
members who had petitioned for candidacy 
arc without competition

Instructor fights dismissal from IPFW 



by Not Beckky 
Editor 

A student claiming racist behavior on the 
part of an instructor has been awarded 
S9.500 in a settlement with IPFW and its fis- 
cal agent Purdue. 

The instructor. Jack Ryan has been 
removed from die university. In response 
Ryan has filed a grievance against the uni- 
venity to be reinstated to his former posi- 
tion. 

The student's complaint concerned a 
statement of Ryan's. According to Ryan's 
attorney, John Theisen, Ryan's conlrdct was 
not renewed and his client was never given a 



chance to address the accusations made by 
ttic student. 

The student also claimed Ryan told her to 
"talk white " Other sources have said that 
Ryan told her to speak professionally when 
she gives a speech. 

"Purdue University says he (Ryan) has no 
rights as a non-tenured instructor." Tbeisen 
said. 

According to IPFW guidelines, the uni- 
versity does not need to state any reason 
when they do not renew a non-tenuied (or 
not-scheduled- for tenure) instructor's con- 
tract. 

Theiscn said the purpose of Ryan's action 
is to be rehired by the university at his for- 



mer position. 

"We want to vindicate my client's good 
name and make him whole for any losses he 
incurred," Theiscn said. 

Tbeisen said the committee which 
presided over the hearing will make a rec- 
ommendation to Purdue President Sieven 
Becring If Uiere are no favorable results for 
his client. Theisen said he would be willing 
to take "further action." 

"It was quite clear the university labeled 
Ryan a racist without ever talking to the stu- 
dent." John Briggs, writing instructor, said. 
Briggs has taken his opiiuon to The Journal 
Gazette, In a guest editorial written by 
Briggs he said, "IPFW administrators have 



overreached. By publically labeling Ryan a 
racist, they have made it virtually impossible 
for him to find another teaching position " 

According to Briggs, Ryan had the stu- 
dent in two classes before tliis incident. 

"If there was racism, it would've been 
apparent after two semesters," Bnggs said. 

The student's complaint stemmed from a 
comment made by Ryan in the 199S spring 
semester. According to Ryan, he said he was 
lecturing about the importance of identifying 
yourself to an audience during a speech or 
else [he speaker may be remembered as "that 
big. black woman" who spoke about drugs 
and gangs. 

See Instructor, pages 



for the office of president. The three vice 
president positions were petitioned for by 
Chris Douse, J Tilden Brown and Tony 
Laux. The student body programming 
director's only petitioner is Erin Fridh. and 
the sole petitioner for treasurer is Mike 
Heii. No petitions were received for 
Student Senate. 

At the judicial court hearing, the judges 
listened to a statement prepared by Eads in 
which he acknowledged the constitutional 
violation and asked the court to decide 
whether die election should be postponed.

University

science 

building 

by Cassfe [titter 
Chief Reporter 

IPFW, in conjunction with 
Hagerman Construction, will 
undergo construction of a new sci- 
ence building. The project is to 
begin this April and should be 
done for fall classes in 1998 

According to Don Kalter, direc- 
tor of the physical plant, the sci- 
ence building will be located on 
the west end of parking lot #11 
and will extend westward toward 
the river. Parking lot #1 1 is situat- 
ed between Neff and the 
Classroom Medical building. The 
remainder of parking lot ffll will 
revert to lawn. 

Due to die construction traffic, 
the north end of parking lot #10 - 
the lot alongside the river - will be 
temporarily closed However. 
there will continue to be access to 
the Physical Plant Building. 
Printing Services Warehouse, and 
the dock area on the west side of 
the Classroom Medical building. 

In addition to the above 
changes, several other parking 
changes can be expected Parking

mer break and will be accessible

IPSGA needs to buy 
calendar, learn functions 



As if ibey didn'l have (ime to 
post election procedures, COME 
ON. What have ibey been doing ' 
By not advemsing the election rules 
10 poieniial candidates, IPSGA has 
once again proven to be a collection 
of figurcbeads wiih little ambition 
and no real functions 

Tbc members of Students 
Government have forgotten ibat 
itiey have jobs to do. not just lilies 
to beef up ibeir resumes It takes 
more than an mvitation to ibe chan- 
cellor's house for a soiree lo be 
president. By not advertising ilie 
election rules and dates, those 
involved are trying to keep control 
and to allow their friends lo be re- 
elected without much challenge 

Truth be told. ibLs years IPSGA 
is notbing more ilian a fraiemity- 



sororiiy with ttic power lo do what- 
ever. They control the student funds 
and do basically what they want to 
do, never mind what the students 
want For instance, this year's 
Vegas Night featured middle school 
dancers, one of whom is related to 
an IPSGA member. The kids were 
cute and some were even talented. 
bul it was inappropriate entertatn- 
meni for rowdy gamblers. 

This Utile slip-up is a clear indi- 
cation that we need effective stu- 
dent politicians dedicated lo gov- 
erning the student body and listen- 
ing to the voices of those with con- 
cerns Without a doubt, by violating 
their own constitution, the current 
members of student goverruneni are 
notfitforre-eleciion. 



Letter to the editor 



Kudos to Kelley 



To the editor 

1 would like to thank S. Brant 
Kelley for the excellent commen- 
tary which he gives 'From the 
Right Field " Today's media is so 
biased toward liberal thinking, that 
it is refrcstiing to sec someone who 
IS willing to present the truth rather 
than trymg to at&gt;olish all moral val- 
ues. Journalism need* more people 
like Mr, Kelley, who have a grasp 
on the way things should be. All 



too often we are asked to believe 
that every person should be able lo 
behave however he or she desires. 
However, without restrictions our 
society is chaotic and destructive. 
Through the Bible. God has given 
guidelines for how we should lead 
our lives Thank you, Mr. Kelley. 
for encouraging people to stand by 
these prmciples.

the failure of the facial bones to 
develop properly during fetal devel- 
opment 1 was bom witb a particu- 
larly severe form of Treacher 
ColUns syndrome. I was bom with 
no ears — the outer ears and ear 
canals simply did not form. I had 
tiny knobs of skin where outer ears 
should have been and my inner ear 
nerves were shut off from the out- 
side by a solid wall of bone. The 
middle of my ears were badly 
deformed. As a result, I have a 
severe hearing loss, for which I 
wear a special bone-conduction 
implantable bearing aid I was bom 
with out a chin, cheekbones or eye 



sockets. I had 
wide-open cleft 
palate, a tiny moutb 
and a tongue so 
large that it hung 
out of my mouth or 
fell back into my 
liny Ihroat. endan- 
gering my breath- 
mg. 

I have had over 
100 operations to 
correct these prob- 
lems, to enable me to survive, and 
to give me a normal hfe. 

My parents have fought battles 
for medical care, decent education 
and social acceptance for all of 
their ten adopted children, many of 
whom were also bom with different 
abilities. There never seems to be a 
problem which they can't face with 
stiengih and a sense of humor. But 
the support does noi end there... 

My church, the Bible Baptist 
Church in Auburn, has been the 
back bone for my survival The pas- 
tor, my Sunday school teachers and 
my fellow church members have 
been a real blessing, especially their 
prayer support around the times of 
my frequent surgeries. 

My high school. Canterbury 
School, surrounded me with class- 
mates who were cheerful, ioving 
and caring Ihey encouraged me 
and helped me with my homework 



math and saence. 1 was the man- 
ager of the basketball team and did 
a lot of camera work for the team I 
felt that my classmate^s accepted me 
for who I was and that I was in an 
environment where my intelligence 
was respected. But that was not 
always the case. 

The school before Canterbury 
was a living hell In the public 
schools I went to, the kids were 
heavily into Satanic worship, rock 
music and word-search games. I 
wasn't, and as a result I didn't Tit in 
anywhere. At first, my peers just 
picked on me, chipping away at my 
self-esteem with verbal harassing I 
fell deeply hun inside and tried to 
find an inner strength to get me 
through the days. 

But then life got worse Spit 
wads, peashooters and other 
makeshift weapons become the 
rage, the ultimate tools of harass- 
ment. Verbal abuse sull accompa- 
nied the physical abuse The kids 
would sneak up on me and launch a 
spit wad, taking pleasure at my 
reactions. They called me names. 
They would snap me on the shoul- 
der with their fingers. My locker 
was often raided and things were 
taken from il. Or it was filled with 
shaving cream. 

1 felt fear every time 1 walked 
into a classroom, the library, the 
band room, the cafeteria, and the 



corridors. Most of the time I tell 
like a walking dead person. 
Sometimes I cried. I couldn't bear 
to tell my parents, because they 
would worry about me and I fell 1 
could handle it myself But no mat- 
ter how mean and violent the kids 
were to me, God kept me sane I 
have smce learned to be more out- 
going and have come out of my 
shell 

I still 'it^ some who fear me, 
avoid mc. and refuse to look at me. 
At limes, I feel like I am parting the 
Red Sea when I walk to class 
because the aowds I approach col- 
lectively avoid me. But I know 
something that I hope all will leam: 
I am just a guy. 1 have feelings and 
friends just like anyone. I love to 
inleracl and will prove it at any 
invitation. Ask me about Star Trek 
and we will talk for hours. 1 will 
one day be a surgeon and hope to 
help others they way I have been 
helped. 

And thai is what I want most, to 
get to know all of you.

PBE^EIfTIKe^ THE PEACE POLE 



by Janet Tobey 
SlafTWrller 

Prcscniinf! ihc peace pole on campus Monday. 
Richard Johnwin, iwociate professor of German 
and also direclor of peace and conflict studies, 
led the group nf panicipanLs in a display of respcci fnr 
the diversity of cullures at IFPW and in die world 

The ceremony included nineteen students, (mm 
many different countries, proclaiming, "May peace pre- 
vail on earth." each in his or her native tongue 
Vietnam, Nigeria, Ghana, Germany. China, Soviet 
Union, Sri Lanka. Finland, Panama, Mexico, Uic United 
Stales and odier countries were represented among die 
siudenu who declared a desire for peace in the world 

The peace pole, located on the ground west of Walh 
Union, has been erected as a symbol of IPFW's com- 
miimenl lo peace, and its incepiion is pan of diversity 
week. The pole will soon be surrounded by four boul- 
ders, one each for norUi, east, south and west, 
creating a native American medicine 
wheel. 

Johnson said he believes the loca- 
tion of ilie symbol on the college 
campus is appropriate and hopes it 
sends a message that the university 
is a place to Icam about peace. 

"The university is a place where 
we come and learn and lalk together 
about a lot of different cultures and 
about nature We bring all of those 
things together when we are studying the 
natural sciences, ihe social sciences and the 
biimaniiies We are all trying to find out who we

Laura Nagy. faculty member, and students Deb Smith, 
JulJe Rboades and Felicia Beechjng bless the ground. 



Onlookers watch al the dedication cerenxiny of the Peace Pole 



nd how we fit in this whole plan." Johnson said. 

One of ibe things that be is most 

pleased about, he said, is thai there are a 

growing number of international students 

on campus. 

Another imponant element to diversi- 
ty is the instruction in foreign languages 
at the university, said Johnson, IPFW 
currently offers courses in German, 
French. Spanish. Chinese and Russian. 
With more faculty and resources, more for- 
eign languages will evcniuaJly be available, 
Johnson said. 
"Let us know what languages 
you are interested in lalung. 
and we will do what 
we can." he said. 

Johnson's 
speech was fol- 
lowed by Ihe 
proclamations of 
peace by students 
from all over the world 
and by a Native ■American 
ceremony. 

Laura Nagy. a representative of the Miami 
Nation, led the crowd in a Native American bless- 
ing of the location of the peace pole. All of die 
onlookers took a pinch of lobacco from baskets 
passed around the crowd. Participants used the 
tobacco as a symbohc offcnng in asking for die 





something, we 
are connected lo 
the rcc 
explained Nagy 
The crowd, led 
by Nagy, made 
an offering to the 
east, south, west 
and north, a.sking 
for blessings 
from the spirits of 
each direction. 

Nagy also 
commented on 
the appropriate- 
ness of a medi- 
cine wheel hav- 
ing a peace sym- 
bol at its center. 

"Medicine to 
the Native 

Amencans means 
much more than 
healing the body^ii me: 
said. 

The peace pole is made of wood and painL It is a 
physical symbol, fwed in the ground. But, as Johnson 
said, we who come into contact with the symbol can 
take it with us into the outside community.

Internet provides drug for soap addicts 



by Paul Tupper 
Managing Editor 

With school occupying your day and 
work fdling your nights, you run die risk 
of overworking your VCR by tapmg the 
countless soap operas needed to escape 
life even bnefly. Wouldn't it be great if 
"One Life lo Live" or "Melrose Place" 
were available when it is convenient for 
YOU. when YOU have the time to tune 
In? Perhaps Billy and Allison should 
lease each odiet on-line, so we all could 
link up and waich whenever we wanted? 
That day has arrived with a new 
"cyber soap" from Mainex Multimedia 
Corp. The East Village" teUs the evolv- 
ing tale of New York twentysomcihings 
who live near each other atid whose lives 
intertwine. Some have sex with each 
oiher, some refuse lo have sex with 
each other, some are friends and 
some just sit back and talk aboul the 
others. It's a combination thai has 
worked for many a soap 



As a new Internet user, I was not sure 
what 10 expect. Wilh technology rapidly 
moving for- 
ward, 1 did ^^^=1 

not doubt Ihc 

possibility of 

seeing an 

actual soap 

opera unfold 

before my 

eyes I was 

disappointed 

lb find 

words and 

still pictures — ^ 

instead of a 

moving picture. Because I am a fan of 

the old-fashioned novel, I proceeded to 

read. 



Eve Ramsay, your every -mid -twenties 
female and narrator, takes the reader 



"Some have sex with each other, 

some refuse to have sex with each 

other, some are friends and some 

just sit baci&lt; and tail&lt; about 

the others. " 



through the lives of other characters. She 
painbi a biased but interesting picture of 

the cast. But die reader need not depend 



on Eve for complete descriptions of the 
others. At any given moment, one can 
click on a character for addition- 
al informaiion, such as fave 
books, films. CD's and aspira- 
tions. This makes soap opera 
watching more interacuve 

The Iniemei proves to 
be a comfortable home for soap 
operas and avid readers alike. 
Having only witnessed the first 
insiallmcni of "The East 
Village," it is hard to rate the 
soap, especially in this new 
arena. But Ihe writers show 
promise, and the characters have 
room to grow With that said. I recom- 
mend signing on lo "The Easi Village "

International student copes 
with culture problems 



by Nolrlda G. HB. Mandica 
Staff Writer 

People in indusinal countries 
tend to use lime as effectively as 
tbey can People in the United 
Slates value time tbe same as 
money They musi sci appointments 
to meet each other. In Japan, people 
use time even tighter than people in 
the US. According lo my Japanese 
friend, m Japan every minute is 
valu^lc When making an appoint- 
ment, in Japan one says, "I will 
meet you at 10:01 ajn " In contrast, 
here people make appointments 
using every five minutes, saying. "I 
will meet you at 10:05 or 10:15 
a.m." 

The people m my home country 
of Indonesia, a developing nation in 
Asia, do not view ume as people in 
the U.S or people of Japan do. Our 
culture does not encourage us to 
make money or wcrk all the lime. 

As a matter of fact, people 
apparently always have lime for 
others It would be considered 



impolite to avoid meeting someone 
by saying that we are busy or have 
something imponant lo do Family 
and friends are more important than 
anything. 

After one and a half years in this 
country, the feeling of homesick- 
ness has not left me yet. 1 assume 
that it is a result of having only a 
few friends and no organizational 
activity. 1 used to be a pretty busy 
person. When I was an undergradu- 
ate, besides going to school with 21 
or sometimes 24 acdit hours. 1 was 
a member of over six social organi- 
zauons I was on a schedule ail the 
time. 

Even though I could not count 
bow many assignments I had lo fm- 
isb and how many programs for my 
organisations 1 had to complete, 1 
still bad time for my family and 
fnends. No matter bow busy 1 was. 
as far as 1 was concerned, I never 
said "no" to others if ihey came to 
me with or without appointments. 
Most of the time, people just 



stopped by and talked to us 

Now I am here No friend comes 
to visit me regularly. No family 
member comes to ask for help. I 
feel very sad honestly. 

Sometimes 1 want to run from 
this country It drives me crazy 
every time 1 find myself alone. 1 am 
alone because nobody is around to 
talk to because everybody is busy 
working and gomg to school. 

Thus. 1 concenuaie on school 
only. 1 Just have two places to go: 
school and home. 1 stay in school 
sometimes as long as 1 stay at 
home 1 go to school at 9 ajn. or 10 
am. every day and go back home 
sometimes at 10 p.m. or 11 pjn. 

I think that rem&lt;uning here stim- 
ulates me to study more than I used 
lo do Sometimes my foster family 
says that I work hkc bell in school, 
wbicb I have to do to terminale my 
desire to go back home to my warm 
family and friends. 

Staying in a different country, of 
course, bas changed my attitude 



towards time. Gradually, 1 realize 
that this country makes me more 
individualistic. 1 sometimes say no 
to my foster family or my fnends 
when they ask me for a favor just 
because I think of myself first 1 
have become selfish by positioning 
myself first, which 1 am not sup- 
posed lo do in my culture. My 
social life has declined. I have noth- 
ing to think about but myself. 

1 always encounter my changing 
behavior, but environment dictates 
that 1 should behave like this. 

Environment takes a significant 
role in changing my adjustment to 
time use I am unsure if I can place 
myself back in my old habits which 
means taking time to talk to fnends 
or family for many hours

Shakespeare spawns weird troupe 



hy Amanda Manion 
Features Fxlitor 

William Shakespeare is 
rolling over m his grave. 
March 21-23 at 8 p.m.. 
Purdue Indiana Tbeater presents 
"An Evening of Fractured 
Shakespeare in the Studio Theatre, 
KeiUer Hall. Room G32 

Each of the vigneitei is a spoof, 
travesty, adaptaLon or condensation 
of a Shakespearean work One 
group of actors will perform "The 
Fifteen Minute HamleL" Yes, they 
do "Hamlei" in 1 5 minutes. 

"(The creators of Ihese works) 
tried to spoof everything that is bad 
about a Shakespeare play, like the 
one actor that plays five different 
roles." said Heidi Warfel. senior 
theatre major and director of "Much 
Ado About as You Like it." 
Accordmg to Warfel. "Goofy things 
happen, like ughts falling down." 

"It's Monty Python does 
Shakespeare." said Joel Moorman, 
director of "JuUus and Cleopatra." 

All of the students in the seven 
shon shows were brought together 
through the combination of classes 
Directing 11 and Acting 11 Marcia 
D. Hepps, assistant professor of the- 
atre is supervisor and consulting 
director for tbe performance and 
instructor for the class 

"Tbe course provides whole new 
realms of the different aspects of 
the theatre It's also a chance for 
actors to learn that each director is 
different." Hepps said 

Students will perform the play 
for the public and then tour through 
nine different schools. Hepps said

Morissette's psyche 
mystery to many 



%&amp;4 



One can hardly describe the dis- 
may I felt as I watched MTV yes- 
terday. The new Alanis Morisseite 
video "Ironic" began to play and 1 
watched intently. I'm not a huge 
Alanis fan. but she's beginning to 
grow on me, espe- 
cially because of 
this tune. 

For those unfa- 
miliar with the 
video, allow me to 
explain. We open 
with Ms. Morisseite 
cruising down the 
road singing to her- 
self or so it seems 
As the refrain 
comes up, a wacky 
green-sweaier-clad 
Alanis breaks into 
song in the back 
seat. There are two, 
count them, two 
Alanis Morissettes 
in the same car. 
Suddenly, I'm find- 
ing myself begin- 
ning to enter tbe 
same mood brought 
about by those 
damn Prodaimers 
— those black rimmed glasses 
dynamic duo and their "1 Would 
Walk 500 Miler." video gave me 
nightmares for months. Of course, 
there's only one Alanis in reality, 
but she has company here- 
Amused, I continue to watch. As 
the refrain ends and the spastic back 
seat Alanis stops singing, the cam- 
era pans aaoss the seat to a cynical 
Alanis (the third now) who takes 
her turn to harmonize She adds her 
part to the lyrics. The camera jumps 
to the passenger seat where a bor- 
derUne suicidal Alanis picks up the 
song The dnving Alanis giggles as 



"...the idea 

of four Alanis 

Morissettes 

driving down 

the road is 

frightening. 

They are 

happy now, 

but what if 

they start 

singing 'You 

Oughta 

Know'?" 



she pulls her loony 
passenger back into 
the car. weaving 
around traffic and 
speeding down an icy 
road as tbey sing 

I'm being 

dragged along in a 
whirlwind of music. 
The four Alanis 
Morissettes bum, 
sing and inicraci in a 
way that is new. yet 
somehow scary. Each Alanis repre- 
sents a different attitude and aspect 
of her personality. It is neat, but tbe 
idea of four Alanis Monssetles dri- 
ving down the road is frightening. 
Tbey are happy new, but what if 
they Stan singing 
"You Oughta 
Know"? A demo- 
lition derby and 
five-state car 
cba.sc is bound to 
follow. 

Now 
don't get me 
wrong I'm start- 
ing 10 enjoy Ms. 
Morissette's 
music I just don't 
think that 1 was 
personally ready 
for four of her in 
one setting. I like 
tbe song. I like 
the video. 

What it 
comes down to is 
that the woman 
scares me. One 
minute she's 
happy and all 
pretty smiles. The 
next minute she's screaming and 
scowling like a woman deprived of 
her Thorazine ! mean pick a mood 
and go with it. Maybe MTV should 
just run a warning or some kind of 
disclaimer. That way, those of us 
who are easily confused or fright- 
ened won't suffer a brain aneurysm 
as computers multiply a popular 
Canadian siren If nothing else with 
the new multiple Alanis 
Morisselies. she'll have someone to 
share her Grammys with As for 
me, I'll be under my bed. talking to 
myself and thinking happy

That's not a good thing, though. 
The last thing I want to do is control 
someone else's play," Moorman 
said 

Student directors leam bow lo 
think not only of about a player's 
portrayal of a character, but also 
aspects of lighting, sound and 
blocking The class provides them 
with an all-encompassing view of 
the theatn:. 

Many students found themselves 
on ihc stage acung, in the director's 
chair and in the sound booth. 

"It's easy to forget what the 
other people are going through. 
[The class] gives a nice perspective 
on other people's jobs," Warfel 
said. 

Besides learning about the more 
physical and technical aspects of 
the theatre, directors learned valu- 
able lessons about comedy. 

"Humor is a very big challenge 
in itself Vou just have to have a 
sense of timing as a director and 
then convey that to your actors. We 
had 10 make humor out of some- 
thing silly. Being clever and mtelh-

humor is " Moorman said.

i-ivc icams Irom ihi' Big Ten. 
and not one of them advanced pasi 
the second round of ihe NCAA 
iDumameni When will ihe NCAA 
rinally wise up and learn ihal the 
conference isn't as powerful as ii 
once used lo be? 

Call it paiily, attribute il lo the 
fact thai there arc 11 instead of 10 
teams in the conference, but (he fact 
remains thai the caliber of play in 
the Big Ten is sub-par compared 
with the lesi of the country. 

Sure Ihifdue ouilasied the rest of 
the conference lo win an unprece- 
dented third consecutive league 
title. Honestly, even Boilermaker 
fan&lt;, must admit, being the best 
team in the Big Ten ibis season 
wasn't much of an ac^romphshment. 
The first of the Big Ten teams to 
fall in the toumameni was confer- 
ence runner-up Penn Slale The 
Niliany Lions, seeded fifth in the 
Easi regional, couldn't hil the broad 
side of a bam and lost handily lo 
)2ih seed Arkansas. Nem in line 
was Michigan. The lame-brained 
Wolverines suffered a case of lost 
concentration once again and ala 
Juwon Howard in the 1992 title 
game versus North Carolina, called 
a timeout ihey didn't possess The 
resulung technical fou! proved lo be 
the sbove out ihe door for another 
Big Ten team. 

Then, the almost unthinkable 
happened For the second straight 
year the traditionally successful 
Bobby Knight and his Hoosiers 
were escorted from ihe "Big 
Dance" in Ihe first round The 
Hoosiers were eliminated by 
Boston College, not exactly a pow- 
erhouse from the Big East 

The iwo teams thai were suc- 
cessful in the opening round, 
Purdue and Iowa, didn't exactly 
demolish their competition 

Iowa, the sixth seed in the West, 
outlasted a talented George 
Washington team thai handed 
UMass its only loss of the season 
The Hawkeyes turned in a com- 
mendable performance but face it, 
the game may have been the high- 
light of the tournament (or (he Big 
Ten 

Purdue was handed (he top 
billing in the West and was given 
all it could handle and more by 16th 
seeded Western Carolina. The 
Catamounts clawed at the Boilers 
thruughoui the game and nearly 
sent Purdue back to West Lafayette 
as Ihe only number one ever to fall 
to a number 16 seed 

By the end of Ihe second round 
not one Big Ten team remained in 
ihe tournament. Both the Hawkeyes 
and Ihe Boilers were ehminaied by 
second round opponents. Iowa was 
thrashed by Arizona and Purdue 



Freedom is 
fragile and must 
be protected. To 
sacrifice it, even 
as a temporary 
meature is to 
betray it. 

Germaine Greer 
c. 1980 



was virtually embar- 
rassed by Georgia. 
At least both of Ihem 
made ii that far in the 
loumament 

It's painfully 
obvious thai the Big 
Ten did not deserve 
the live invitations 
that the NCAA 
issued to conference 
teams. As recently as 
last year, six Big Ten 
teams made it into 
the tournameni and 
five went home after the fir^t round. 
By inviting undeserving teams 
from bigger conferences like the 
Big Ten and Allaniic Coasi 
Conference, ihe NCAA selection 
committee is effectively overlook- 
ing smaller, more deserving learns 
from smaller conferences. Maybe 
some of Ihe smaller, unknown 
schools wouldn't fair very well in 
ibe tournameni? Bui then again. 
whal's Ihe difference if it's another 
Big Ten school or a school from the 
middle of nowhere losing in ihe 
first round? 

After all, you never know what 
might happen when David meets 
GoUaih. Just ask last year's champi- 
on UCLA. The ixadiuon rich Bruins 
were methodically eluninalcd by an 
Ivy League school that doesn't give 
scholarships and plays a slow down 
game that lulls its opponents lo 
sleep Princeton, coached by a 
throwback in every sense of the 
word, provided the toumameni with 
a high drama game and p(^sslbly the 
feel good siory of Ihe year 

Maybe next season the NCAA 
will open ils eyes and realize the 
injustice being served, then again 
it's doubtful After all. we are 
speaking about the politics and 
money of big lime college basket- 
ball here 



Ijndy Jones tabbed as best player in conference 



by JlmPorler 
Sports Editor 

Senior Lindy Jones' basketball 
career is over, at least as a player. 
Jones finished her career at IPFW 
as the school's second all-time lead- 
ing scorer She became only the 
second player in school history lo 
score more than 2,000 points in her 
career at the last home game of Ibe 
season. To say that her four years as 
a sianer on the women's basketball 
team have been filled with acco- 
lades and accomplishments would 
be an undersialemenl. 

To cap off her playing days, 
Jones was named the Great Lakes 
Valley Conference Player of The 
Year II is only the second lime thai 
a player from IPFW has garnered 
such an honor In 1991-92 Lisa 
Miller was named as the first 
GLVC Player of The Year for the 
Mastodons. 

"Lindy was on a mission this 
year," Coach Pam Bowden said. "It 
was one of her goals and she really 
deserved it " 

Al Ihe beginning of the season 
Bowden asked each of her players 
to write down their individual and 
team goals for Ihe year. High on 
Jones' list was to become ihe best 
player she could and be named the 
beiJl player in Ihe conference. 

"1 worked really hard and was 
really glad 1 go! ii," Jones said. "1 
was happy but it would have been 
much nicer if we would have gone 
farther in the toumameni." 

The Mastodons lost in the open- 
ing round of the Great Lakes 



Regional toumameni despite Jones 
scorii^g 40 points. 

According to Bowden the award 
was a result of Jones's hard work 
and dedication lo the team 

"She works really hard and has 
come a long way even compared to 
last season," Bowden said "What 
we'll miss mosi is her 26 points per 
game" 

Jones led the 'Dons and the 
GLVC in sconng this season as she 
averaged 26 points per game She 
wisn'l just a scorer though. 

"1 think that ihey were looking 
for a well-rounded player," Jones 
said. "I don't think dial it all had to 
do with my shifting abihty 1 think 
that my rebounding helped out too ' 

After graduation and getting 
married diis summer, Jones hopes 
10 get into the coaching side of bas- 
ketball 

"I plan on going back lo Decatur 
and try coaching," Jones said. 

Despite warnings from others 
conceming the pressures of coach- 
ing. Jones feels that it would be a 
great learning experience lo be on 
the other side of the game for once.

Basketball coach calls it Rnspholl mOVI^S 



quits after nine years 



by Jim Port«r 

SpnrL^ Editor 

The "Andy Piaiza Era" is over 
ai IPFW The bead men's basket- 
ball coacb announced Monday (hat 
he is stepping down from his cur- 
reni position lo punue other career 
interests in sports His resignation 
rakes effect June 30. 1996. 
Piayza compiled a 142-108 record 
in nine years at ibe helm for the 
Mastodons, He led Ihe team to its 
only Great Lakes Valley 
Conference championship in Ibe 
1992-93 season and posted a school 
record 23 wins. The 'Dons also 
made their first trip to the NCAA 
Tournament in the same year 

According lo Athletic Director 
Dutch Perchan, Pia/za's stmt at 
IPFW will not go unnoticed. 

"Nine years ago Andy Pia?za 



came lo iPFW He inbented a pro- 
gram that was in disarray," Perchan 
said. "He leaves us with a program 
that we can be proud of both on the 
court and in the classroom." 

Prior to Piazza's reign, the 
school had only won 36 percent of 
its basketball game.s, including only 
28 percent of ils GLVC games 
Piazza made an immediate impact 
on the program After posting a 
respectable 15-13 record in his first 
season, Ihe leain went on lo post 
four 20-plus win seasons and four 
top-20 national ranking.s He leaves 
the school with a winning percent- 
age over ,500 in conference play 

The coacb also leaves a fine aca- 
demic record behind Of the 24 stu- 
denL/aihlcies thai were recrtiiled by 
IPFW during Piazza's reign. 20 
have received degrees from Ihe 
school. In the last three years alone.

My Final Four picks are a good

Heavyweight titles, just as he did at 
the age of 21. Tyson put to rest any 
rumors of diminishing skills with a 
convincing third-round knockout of 
WDC Champion Frank Druno. 
Bruno was hailed as the most 
skilled fighter in the division, yel 
he was clearly intimidated by 
Tyson from the opening bell. Bruno 
looked more prepared to dance with 
Tyson at Die high school prom than 
to fight him in Las Vegas. 

From the opening bell, Tyson

put Bruno on the canvas for good in 
the third round. Bruno was able to 
land only a couple of insignificant 
off-balance jabs ai Tyson through- 
out the fight. Upon seeing the 
exhuberance with which Tyson 
exploded after the fight, it is obvi- 
ous bis desire to destroy is still pre- 
sent 

Tyson's bid to regain the IBF 
and WBA lilies could not have 
come ai a more opponune lime, 
"Iron Mike" is still young and 
could fight for at least another five 
years In addition, the Heavyweight 
division is weak from top to bot- 
tom. The only people who appear 
capable enough to challenge Tyson 
are Riddick Bowe, who has to keep 
his bead out of the clouds lo win, 
and manager Don King. Evander 
Holyficld is too old lo provide an

interesting fight for Tyson. Ditlo 
for George Foreman. 

Tyson says he will fighi next 
against Bruce Seldon in July and 
then Michael Moorer at Ihe begin- 
ning of 1997. 1 suggest ihat promot- 
ers try 10 make the fight a little 
more fair. Let Seldon and Moorer 
fight Tyson on the same night. Why 
prolong the inevitable? Let the two 
fighters aliemate rounds, and then 
Ihe fight may last for more than 
three rounds. 

The only obstacle Tyson will 
encounter on his road back to the 
top is the determination he contin- 
ues to put into each fight. If he gets 
lazy like he did against Busier 
Douglas when be lost his titles in 
Tokyo, then he is very beatable. 
Even Razor Ruddock was able to 
give him two tough fights because 
Tyson's lack of preparation. 

That scenario looks unlikely to 
happen, though, Tyson looks more 
ferocious in the ring iban he ever 
did before his conviction. This time 
he is noi about lo lei money or 
King get in his way And I would 
advise him not to get in Tyson's 
way eilber, unless he wants to team 
up with Seldon and Moorer.

There was a time in my life 
when I lived for the baseball 
season. Every year I would 
hope the Red Sox would win one 
before 1 hit middle age So far they 
have disappointed me. After last 
"season" all baseball has disap- 
pointed me This comes from 
someone who saw Nolan Ryan 
pilch when he was wiib ihe Angels 
Incidentally ihe game was hatted in 
the sixth inning when Ryan's catch- 
er misjudged a fastball and caught 
one in the . , . groin(for lack of a 
better term). 

1 have seen "Hammerin' " Hank 
Aaron take balling pracuce during 
his last season with the Milwaukee 
Brewers. 

When I was in Kansas City fif- 
teen years ago, I watched Ihe New 
York Yankees and Ihe Royals play 
to exua innings, Reggie Jackson 
won Ihe game with a dramatic 
eleventh-inning home nm, 1 caught 
a double header at Wrigley Field in 
the 70s. The Cubs got spanked in 
both games by Ihe Big Red 
Machine of Cincinnati. 

And finally I saw Sieve Carllon 
pitch for both Philadelphia and the 
Chisox 

But after last year I began to 
search for a way to love baseball 
once again Something musl be out 
there for this lost generation of 
baseball fans.- 1 need a baseball 
legacy to pass on to my soti, or else 
I'm afraid he will love monster 
truck bailies like 1 loved baseball in 
my youth. 

I have a list of movies every ex- 
baseball fan should walch^ibese 
have restored some of my love for 
the game, and I hope they can do 
the same for you 

10, The Pride of th« Yankees I 
even hate ihe friggin Yanks (as 
every loyal Bosox fan should) and 1 
loved Ibis movie. Babe Ruth plays 
himself in this classic about the life 
of one of ihe greatest players of all

9. The Bad News Bears. Yes, this 
is another campy 70s movie But 
what makes ii so good is that the

3. A League of Their Own. Gecna 
Davis and Tom Hanks slar in one 
of the flood of great baseball 
movies produced in the last ten 
years. After this film was made 
everyone knew, "There's no crying 
in baseball " 

2. Bull Durham, The other minor 
league film to make the list. Sasan 
Sarandon portrays ihe ullimaie 
baseball fan as she worships in her 
diamond shaped church After ibis 
movie came out I started bavmg 
fantasies about Sarandon and 
Fenway Park — don't ask me why. 
1. Field of Dreams. I cncd dunng 
this movie when "Moonlighi" 
Davis musi make a choice between 
biiseball and his career as a doctor. 

Other movies which just didn't 
make the starting lineup but still 
deserve nole are Major League I 
and II (who can lell the differ- 
ence). Mr. Baseball. Eight 
Men Out, The Babe and The 
Seoul. 

One film which was not 
technically a baseball 
film bul siiU 
deserves a men- 
lion IS Naked 
Gun. Who can for- 
get Leslie Neilson's

Also deserving a 
mention is Keii
