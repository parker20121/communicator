Dear Miss Bosk, 

I am looking forward to 
your first issue of the 
COMMUNICA TOR for the 
new year. I sincerely wish 
that you would consider 
printing throughout the 
• break. I realize 






If the Church had claimed for God's service the new 
learning of the sixteenth century, if it had sought to 
baptize into Christ the new biology of the nineteenth 
century, or the new physics of the twentieth, how much 
alienation and estrangement (rum the Christian faith 
would have been spared today! What ruin and tragedy 
might have been avoidedl Both the Church and the univ/ 
ersities are paying dear for that fatal blindness. It 
will need great Insight and humility on both sides to 
overtake the consequences. We must have a collabor/ 
atton on a new basis to rescue man from his spiritual 
bankruptcy.

that this would be an in-

but your publication would 
be the perfect way to alert 
the students of class changes

to the students. It might 
also be possible to give an 
evaluation of some [acuity

would help the students to 
become more familiar* with 
the new faculty so that they 
would be able to better se-

As printing during vaca-

be yours. I think, however, 
that the service to the stu-

Laet Wednesday the 
kickoff meeting for organ- 
izing the secong annual Cri- 
a is-of-the -Environment 
Teach-in was held. The stu- 
dent Alpha Chapter of the 
Izaak Walton League is 
sponsoring the Teach-in. 

Those who remember 
last year's Teach-In will re- 
cell that it broadly touched 
all aspects of the environ- 
mental problem. This year 
the Teach In wilt concen- 
trate on the over-population 
problem, since many other 
environmental crises stem 
from this.

DR. ERDTHAN EXHIBITS MORE NEW LAB EQUIPMENT. 



by Oianne Lomont 

The new look for rgeks 
this year is space I The Geo- 
logy Department at l.U.-P.U. 
is currently in the process 
of building a geology ser- 
vice laboratory. It will be 
used in preparation for a 
functional lob in connection 
with the palcoatology and 
mineralogy-petrology labs. 

Students and faculty 
members may use the lab for 
research. Materials collec- 
ted on field trips will be 
brought into the lab. These 
materials will then be stored 
temporarily in the lab for 



later analysis. 

The current lab ia an 
all-purpose lab with tempor- 
work tables and limited stor- 
age room- The new lab will 
have much more storage 
room for materials being stu- 
died and for research collec- 
tions. In addition to the 
equipment already used by 
the Department, the lab will 
be equiped with heavy work- 
study tables and a new rock 
grinder and polisher for pro- 
ducing thin sections of 
rocks for rock analysis. At
