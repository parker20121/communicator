Two years ago, like yesterday 



By Scott M. Lawson 
and Sara Swihart 

The Communicator 

Thursday marks 
anniversary of 
2001 tragedy 

"There were 17 minutes 
between the crashing of the first 
jetliner and the second. 

During those 17 minutes, 
most people watching thought it 
was just a horrible, bizarre acci- 

But as the second hijacked 
commercial jet struck the World 
Trade Center, most watching real- 
ized it was a horrific attack. 

For this generation, it'll 
remain a collective memory 
decades from now. 

Most can easily recall where 
and when they first learned about 
the attacks of September 11, 2001. 
With little effort, those first emo- 
tions — be they of confusion or rage 
or fear — can also be relived. 

Thursday will mark two years 
since that disastrous morning. To 
many, it still seems like the hijack- 
ings of four U.S. jetliners and their 
use as weapons of mass destruc- 
tion took place just yesterday. 

"It brought everything into a 
new reality. I never thought terror- 
ism could happen in America. 
After that, you watch over your 



r Doug Ebert 



back a little bit 

That day added dozens of 
now-household words. Osama. 
Al-Qaida. "Let's roll." The Taliban. 
The Axis of Evil. 

It led to an ongoing "war on 
terrorism" and the creation of a 
new cabinet position in the White 
House - the Office of Homeland 
Security. 

For many, it also made terror- 
ism a daily concern instead of an 
afterthought of troubles that only 
take place in the Middle East. 

"I remember that day pretty 
well," senior Justin Markley said. 
Time is now fractured between life 
before-Sept. 11 and after Sept. 11, 
2001. 

Markley was visiting New 
York earlier this summer when a 
massive power outage left much of 
northeastern United States and 
Canada without electricity. 

"Pre-9-11, if there's a blackout, 
I don't think the first thing that 
would have come to mind was: 'Oh 
God, is this a terrorist attack?' Post- 
9-11, it was the first thing we all 
thought," he said. "When an event 
does happen, it's the first thing you 
think of." 

Michelle Loraine, whose 
daughter Micky Jimenez is an 
incoming second semester IPFW 
freshman, was in her office when a 
mass e-mail informed them of the 
first plane crashing. 

"We all thought: 'Wow. That is 
crazy. What are the odds?'" 

About a quarter-hour later, a 



second mass e-mail arrived. 

"At that point, we knew some- 
thing bad, something very wrong 
w.is going on," 1 oraine said. 

Her daughter Micky was in 
history class at Bishop Luers - and 
ended up watching history unfold 
in front of their eyes. One image is 
bumed into her memory. 

"The people jumping out of 
the buildings," she said. "It was 
really sad." 

Ben Gates, with the IPFW 
Department of History, notes it 
wasn't the first terrorist attack in 
the United States. A century ago. 
President William McKinley was 
killed by a terrorist. 

But. it was the first attack 
aimed directly at civilians, he 
believes. That makes it unprece- 
dented. The War on Terrorism was 
another unprecedented concept. 
Gates said. 

"You don't have to be a 
Pulitzer-Prize winning historian to 
know that the world has changed 
since then," he said. "Historians 
don't usually deal with something 
this recent, but its clearly dunged 
everything." 

Issakha Omar, a native of 
Sudan and now an IPFW freshman, 
was living in Fort Wayne with the 
strikes took place. 

"It was too bad, all those inno- 
cent people being killed," Omar 

He, like many, thought it 
looked like a movie when he 
turned on his television that morn- 



He has lived in America lor 
about five years. Omar, like 
Markley, visited New York this 

"I saw Ground Zero. 1 saw it 
(New York City) before when I 
came to the United States, but it's 
totally different," he said. 

Like many, he was engrossed 
with the news coverage. 

Markley and Ebert were as 

"I didn't focus on school, I 
was pretty much glued to the TV," 
Ebert said. 

Markley was essentially surf- 
ing media through the day. 

"They had TVs here. We'd 
watch those. We'd go home and 
watch that. We'd listen to the radio 
in-between. You constantly felt like 
something else was going to hap- 
pen," he said. 

Since Sept. 11, 2001, there is a 
difference in our sense of security, 
the nature of warfare and of terror- 
ism itself, Gates said. 

The nature of warfare has 
evolved to a fight with a mindset, 
not a country per se. 

"It's pretty clear to me that, the 
intent of the people who are mak- 
ing terrorist attacks would be the 
same kind of intent an imposing 
army would have: to produce 
causalities, to produce some sort of 
capitulation on the part of the gov- 
ernment thev are attacking," Gates 
explained. 

That is not uncommon in war. 
But the difference is how this war

O'Rourke: terrorism is a 'weapon 
of losers,' believes in Iraqi war 



The Omnibus Lecture began 
with a hard-hitting start on 
Monday, September 8, 2003. 
Acclaimed author and journalist 
P.J. O'Rourke pulled no punches in 
his presentation to a full house in 
the Walb Ballroom. 

Funded by the English, 
Bonter, and Mitchell foundation, 
the lecture series provides the 
chance, as Chancellor Michael 
Wartell said in his introduction, "to 
bring the community and the cam- 
pus closer together." 

He further commented "It's 
wonderful to see folks who ordi- 
narily don't get out to the campus, 
here on campus to see these lec- 
tures." Wartell praised the speaker, 
noting that "tonight's lecture I 
think will be especially wonderful, 
amusing, pithy ... and our speaker 
is really a delight." 

The New York Times best sell 
ing author books arrived without 
pretense from the side of the ball- 
room and chatted with the chancel- 
lor before the introduction, crack- 
ing jokes even before his speech. 

Professor James G. Toole per- 
haps provided the introduction for 
the speech, commenting "P.J. 
O'Rourke is one of the few truly 
funny people in the political world 

He recognizes that politics can 
be absurd, and he invites us to 
laugh with him." 



O'Rourke' s twenty years of 
experience in war coverage were 
evident in his speaking, and almost 
immediately after his words of 
greeting his dry jokes garnered 

The speaker rarely looked to 
his notes, and commanded the 
audience's attention for the dura- 
tion of his hour-long speech in a 
direct and unaffected matter. 
Hailing from Toledo, Ohio, he com- 
mented "it's great to return to the 
part of the country the rest of 
America makes fun of. ... When 
people on the East Coast ask me 
why it is so flat out here 1 always 
say so we can see you coming." 

The introduction to his topic 
was brief. "What I thought I would 
talk about tonight (its been on my 
mind, I think it's been on every- 
one's mind,) is Iraq." 

Terrorism was a major theme 
in his speech, a practice he called 
the "weapon of losers." O'Rourke 
built his case by posing questions 
and answering them to form a log- 
ical argument for "economic free- 
dom," which he called the "heart of 
all freedom." 

The speaker's Libertarian 
viewpoint brought a fresh look at 
old analysis. "The Bush administra- 
tion doesn't seem to have the 
answers in Iraq, but what are the 
questions?" 

Throughout the speech his 
most effective weapon was humor, 
which turned the speech from a 
potentially boring political lecture 




i engaging discourse i 



"Is the answer UN-led social 
reconciliation and infrastructure 
repair? No, I would say the answer 
would be blow the place to bits. 
Some say the US doesn't have a 
plan to solve the problem of Iraq, I 
say we blew the place the bits," he 
quipped. 

While he concedes Iraq is a 
"mess," he argues, "it is a mess that 
cannot systematically kill torture 
and oppress millions of its own cit- 

O'Rourke believes "It can be 
argued that this was a good war," 
with bad timing. In response to the 
people who claim America went to 
Iraq for oil he

buy oil than to steal it?" 
O'Rourke called Saddam Hussein 
"stupid," and a man who in his 
palaces was "guilty of felony interi- 
or decorating." 

In his speech he railed against 
the perils of fascism, a political sys- 
tem whose purpose is "to turn peo- 
ple into a mob." In regard to the 
war in Iraq, he asks "how did smart 
people in the Pentagon get sur- 
prised by stupid fascists?" 

O'Rourke spared no player in 
the game- not even the "hyenas in 
high office" at the UN. The French 
were labeled the "butt end" of the 
"moral compass" of the world, and 
the Germans were described as

Editorial 

Giving the greatest gift 

This week, we mark two years since the 9-11 attacks. 

It is a time to remember those lost -- and honor their lives. 

Families of the victims will attend ceremonies. Television will pay tribute in-between "reality" 
programming. 

But there is something more we can do. 

Over 400 New York firefighters, police and port authority workers gave their lives that day. 
Those 44 onboard Flight 93 - realizing they were an enemy's weapon ■■ did the same. 

They didn 't die because they wanted to. They gave their lives so that others may live- That day, 
the)/ were saviors to people they didn 't know. 

"Greater love has no man than this - that a man lay down his life for his friends, " }esus gave as 
philosophy in the Book of John. 

It is a situation where, if any one of us was put in the same situation, our own human nature to 
survive may take precedence to saving others, Most will never face that question. 

But we can all give shares of our lives ■- be it about a pint of blood every three months or about 
one hour a week. Those are two simple ways you can give. 

By giving blood -■ a living portion of yourself — to the American Red Cross. If you're 17 and 
weigh over 110 pounds, you qualify. Your pain is momentary, but your pint may help someone live 
for years. 

By giving your time - and your experience - to Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Northeast Indiana. 

Working ivith a kid who needs some guidance, you can help in a way you may never be able to 
know or appreciate. 

Red Cross appointments can be scheduled by calling 480-8254. Blood drives also take place 
occasionally on the IPFW campus, a time when student blood donors can gather and give together. 
Wouldn't it be a fun irony for college students to give a kegger of blood? 

Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Northeast Indiana can be reached by calling 456-1600 or going 
online to wwxv.bbbsnei.org. It works for kids in Adams, Allen. Dekalb, Huntington, Kosciusko, 
Noble, Wells and Whitley counties. 

There's also the Fort Wayne Urban League (424-6326), St. Mary's Soup Kitchen (426-1217), 
The Salvation Army (744-2311) and the United Way of Allen County (422-4776). Those are organi- 
zations just found in the "Volunteer Services" of the phone book. There are more. 

Every house of worship, be they Christian, Jewish, Muslim or other, needs a helping hand 
beyond weekly services. Any nott -for-profit organization could probably find a way of using what 
help you can give. There are non-profits for dozens of causes, and a few may even be causes in 
which you believe. 

This week is a time for families of the victims to recall. They will continue to feel the pain for 
the rest of their lives, and we need to pray for their well-being. 

But we can do more then watch the ceremonies, pray for them and recall our own anxieties of 
that day two years ago. 

We can act. We can give. 

Most of us will never be asked to give the ultimate gift - the greatest love. Bui we can give our 
r time, our experiences and our talents - and that's a great love in itself.

Welcome to Our 'Land 7 

By Matt Schilling, Student Body President 

First I would like to welcome each and even/ one oj 
you to campus. For many campus is a familiar sight, and 
for some a foreign land. As you can see IPFW is grow- 
ing by leaps and bounds. We now can see the student 
housing project in full swing. The bridge to "nowhere" 
now leads somewhere. It is an exciting time for everyone 
here at IPFW. 

I would encourage you all to get involved in some way. 
The campus now has upwards of 90 student organiza- 
tions and more being started every day. The great ladies 
in the Student Life office arc always willing to help in any 
way they can. If you would like to stop by their office, 
Walb Student Union 115, I'm sure that they would be 
more than happy to give you information on any of the 
organizations. 

I hope by now all of you have been introduced to all 
of the great services offered to you here on campus, 
encourage you to use the services to your advantage. It 
will make your life a bit easier and that is why tliey are 
there, for you to use. 

The fact is that IPFW is what you make of it as a stu 
dent. Co to class and go home, you are bound to hate this 
school. Get involved, meet new people, and I guarantee 
you will have the lime of your life. 

There are so many ways to get involved on cam- 
pus. 1 urge you to find out what they are. Upon finding 

le like you with the same interests your college expe- 
rience here at IPFW will be a great one. 

If you would like to get involved but don't know with 
xvliat exactly, I would be happy to tell you personally just 
what there is to do here. I can be reached at 481-6588, or 
my e-mail stupres@hohnes.ipfw.edu. 1 wish each and 
every one of you luck, and have a great semester. 



To change or not to change, that's the question 



By Deborah Dambn 

M.in.i^in^ Irditor, acting 
The Communicator 



On August 22, 2003, 1 got married. Simple enough. 

The wedding was beautiful. The honeymoon in Sicily was 
fabulous. 

Now 1 have a "new " last name. More importantly, I need to 
change a lot of records. I didn't move, I just changed my last name. 
I need to contact Social Security, go to the Bureau of Motor 
Vehicles for a new driver's license and a car title change. 

I must contact all banks, credit card companies, secretaries of 
all clubs I belong to and also let the post office know my "new" last 
name. But what I really dread is changing my records here at 
IPFW. 

Several years ago, while attending IPFW, I moved and I still 
tremble thinking all I had to do to get that item alone changed on 
my school records here. In retrospect, not only was there a "blood 
letting" but I haven't seen my first born child since that change. 

I realize I'm taking a little "dramatic license" with that last 
remark, but not too much. 

I recently called the Registrar's Office to refresh me on what 
is needed to change my records. They said I have to have a new 
driver's license with my new name. I also need my new Social 
Security card with my new name and signature on it. This takes 



several weeks of waiting for my new card after 
applying for the change at Social Security. 

The Registrar's Office cannot change anything until you have 
both of those items in your possession. The interesting part , how- 
ever, is you need copies of picture ID's and 

documents with your old name on them to prove "you've 
changed." Excuse me, but I think I have to turn those in when I 
apply for the "new name" 
cards/documents. 

I'll just have to remember to copy the "old" ID's before I go to 
the appropriate offices and/or departments and get the "new." 

Then I need to change my records at IPFW with the Bursar's 
Office, get a new Student ID card, change my family membership 
at the Hilliard Gates Center, contact my various student loan 
servers, contact the agencies that I 

received scholarships or grants from . . . then . . . then . . . I've start- 
ed shaking again. My professors will continue to call me by my 
former name until Spring semester when the computer print out 
sheets finally match my "not so new" name. 

Life is about changes, but changes shouldn't be so difficult. 
Maybe I should just keep my "old name."

"poultry in BMWs." 

While usual targets such as 
John Ashcroft and the California 
election were targeted, O'Rourke 
crossed the political spectrum to 
throw a few hits at the "regime 
stink," Bill Clinton, whom America 
"only impeached ... a little." Not 
even Mother Teresa was protected 
from a sly barb. 

Sobering reflections on the 
reality of Iraq were interspersed 
among the gibe, painting a full pic- 
ture of the situation in Iraq and 
Kuwait in a sobering light. 

O'Rourke relates the peril of 
his overseas reporting, where he 
witnessed the much-reported loot- 
ing first hand. He shared the anec- 
dote of Iraqis looting a humanitari- 
an aid cart, and commented that 
"the Iraqis were enjoying them- 
selves." He called not for "nation 
building," but to let the Iraqis gov- 
ern themselves. He believes in a 



future for Iraq, noting "Iraq is 
going to be fine," and he comments 
that there is "no clash of civiliza- 
tion" between the Middle East and 
the United States; rather, that 
"gloKili/ation" has connected even 
the most remote parts of the world 
to the rest of humanity. 

After concluding his hour- 
long speech to appreciative 
applause, the speaker answered 
questions for fifteen minutes. 

When asked what advice he 
would have for college students at

people "advice is wasted." 

Instead, he promotes giving 
"encouragement;" students should

As a first generation college 
student, he acknowledged that 
many of his generation missed the 
real point that, in truth "college is 
about gaining a civilization."

Shim's exhibit brings 
art 'back to nature' 



Since the age of 12, Mee 

Kvung Shim has been expressing 
herself through her painting Hum 
in Korea, 

Shim had no formal introduc- 
tion to painting through school, she 
was taught by one of the for 
female professionals in the CO 

Bachelors in lint- Arts paint: 

Duksung University "i Seoul, 

Michigan with her husband and 
they both completed their master's 
degrees in 1999, 

In 2001 they moved to Fort 
Wayne and Shim immediately 
hosted a gallery with the Fort 
Wayne Museum of Arl. 

"1 was so fortunate to come to 
Fort Wayne, everyone has been 
very welcoming ti&gt; me," she said. 

Shim's early work was 
focused on early Korean Folk Art. 
This style involved only black ink 
on a white background. This was 
done to cause the viewer to fill in 
allowing the painting to speak less 
to you and present more. 

In the late 19th century, how- 
ever, Western influence began to 
overtake the Korean art world. 

This Influence transcended into her 

work. This change took typical flat 
Asian paintings and gave them 
dimension with shadows. 

Although she rarely uses 
shadows, her work is still influ- 
enced by the dominant trends in 
Western painting. 

In the 1960s abstract impres- 
sionism took over and became 
popular for political reasons. This 
style allowed the Government to 
control art. In her recent work. 
Shim Utilizes abstract ideals with 
her collage backgrounds.

painting, 1 want them to develop 
their own story from their own 

idi'imu H s . -tinpi'sed of ambigu- 

their «w n personal ideas to create a 
story. Another feature of her art 
focuses on eyes, 


The eyes in the painting communi- 
cate to the viewers. She also says, 
"The process of making art is so 
mystical." Sometimes she subcon- 
sciously doesn't know what she's 
painting until sometimes up to a 
year later. 

Shim has been a full time 



artist since she was 12, but some 
don't consider art a full time job 
until after they graduate college. 
She always goes to a blank canvas 
and wonders what's next for the 
painting. 

"When I'm done for the day, 
I'm never satisfied and I always 
think it'll be better tomorrow." 
Shim enjoys seeing other works but 
admits she enjoys works when she 
can tell the artist struggles. 

This challenge makes the art 
more enjoyable. Painting is not an 
easy process either From the blank 
canvas, it can take sometimes 2 or 3 
months for her to create a painting. 
Some people believe painting to be 
an easy process. 

'Sometimes I spend up to 10 
or more hours a day in my studio," 
Shim said. 

The titles of her work are also 
questioned many times. She enjoys 
keeping the titles plain and simple. 
This forces the viewers to decide 
what the painting is about rather 
than using a skewed view from the 

Fort Wayne has been able to 
provide her an influx of inspira- 
tion. The neighborhood where her 
gallery is located on Berry Street 
provides her much of this. This 
allows her to show more with the 
connection of humans and nature. 

Shim's work has been fea- 
tured in numerous galleries with 
12 solo shows. Her show at IPFW 
runs until October 3 and her next 
show will be at Taylor University 
in November. 

Her work is very captivating 
and the realism of human and 
nature is unbelievable. 

Recently Shim has been paint- 
ing nature in her work as well. She 
has a huge respect for nature. 

"I like combining humans and 
nature," she said.

Garland tribute artist embodies character 



By Andrew Welfle 
The" 



Since the beginning of time, or 
at least since the Golden Age of 
Movies, we have aspired to emu- 
late the actors of the silver screen. 
From the 1930s to present, there 
have been talented individuals 
who have marked their fame by 
impersonating stars such as Shirley 
Temple, Charlie Chaplin, the Marx 
Brothers, Lucille Ball, and even 
modem "superstars," like Barbra 
Streisand and Cher. 

This is not to say that these 
impersonators are lacking in origi- 
nality or creativity in any way. 
Quite the contrary; it takes an inor- 
dinate amount of talent to mimic 
the subtleties of the star's personal- 



These 
people have 
become a 
whole new 
class of per- 
former we 
now caf 
" t r i b u t t 



"She was 
almost gone by 
the time I was 
realizing she 
wasn't just a 
Ichild star}. 




This weekend, IPFW will host 
one of the aforementioned tribute 
artists, who discovered her likeness 
to a couple of actresses, who hap- 
pen to be mother and daughter — 
Judy Garland and Liza Minelli. 

Performing a show on campus 
called Judy &amp; Me: the Ultimate 
Judy Garland Tribute Show", 
Rhonda Woods and I talked briefly 
on the phone Tuesday morning 
about her work, and the influence 
Judy Garland had on her work— 
and her life. 

"1 feel like I've known her 
IGarlandl all of my life," Woods 
said, "and for so many years as a

child, 1 loved Dorothy [from 
Wizard of Oz) and as I grew older, 
I realized, here is this adult woman 
who has done all of these other 
things. 

"So I've started to learn and 
collect all kinds of memorabilia of 
Judy in every stage of her life. She 
was almost gone by the time I was 
realizing she wasn't just a (child 
star]." 

Woods became a tribute artist 
only after making a name for her- 
self in professional theatre, with 
credits such as Sister Robert Anne 
in "Nunsense," Lola in "Damn 
Yankees,'' Miss Adelaide in "Guys 
&amp; Dolls," and Fruma Sara in 
"Fiddler on the Roof,'" amongst 
many others. She's performed in 
numerous productions at the Molly 
Brown Dinner Theatre in Missouri. 



it of Visual, mil Performing Arts 

for a performance as Judy 



and the Ritz Theatre in Georgia, 
her state of birth. 

Woods realized early on that 
she had a resemblance to Garland, 
and even Minelli. "When I was a 
kid, in my room I was always 
singing to ludv Garland records in 
front of the mirror. So I was kind of 
doing the antics then, without real- 
ly thinking ot impersonating her. 

"As I got earlier, and was 
doing shows such as "Cabaret" (she 
played Sally Bowles), 1 really got 
more comments that I looked like 
Liza, rather than Judy." 

Quipping that she "always 
had the big brown eves" character- 
istic of Liza and Judy, and the 
pi\ie-style haircut characteristic of 
Liza, she found that her resem- 
blance to Liza went hand-in-hand 
with her resemblance to Judy. 



Because many social stigmas 
are associated with Judy Garland 
and the homosexual community, 
many people, when thinking of a 
|udy Garland impersonator, auto- 
matically assume it will be a man 
in drag. This just isn't so. Woods, 
however, has never really con- 
sciously experienced any difficul- 
ties breaking that perception. 

"No, because I think that peo- 
ple from every walk of life or com- 
munity have a respect for Judy 
Garland. I have never really experi- 
enced that," Woods said firmly. 

"Judy &amp; Me" will include 
monologues, songs, and improv. "I 
like to do things off the hip, but I 
also have certain monologues so 
that I can tell Judy's story, and tell 
things that maybe people don't 
know," she explained. 

Woods tried to embody the 
character of Judy so that the audi- 
ence members "feel like they are 
sitting around and spending a little 
time with Judy," as the audience of 
|ud\ herself felt. 

Woods's favorite, most per- 
sonally compelling Judy Garland 
performance was her Carnegie 
Hall run in the early 1960s. Harvey 

Broadway and now the managing 
director of the Fort Wayne 
Youthteatre, actually saw Judy in 
concert in the late 1950s. He 
endorsed Woods's choice by calling 
the performance a "love affair 
between performance and audi-

Food for thought: 
Breakfasts around town 



By K. Daniel Richmond 
The Communicator 

A new fall semester, a daily routine. 
One activity that should be included in this 
routine is often overlooked. Breakfast. 

Recently I visited four restaurants in the 
four corners of Fort Wayne, including 
Willie's Family Restaurant, Bob Evan's 
Restaurant, Cosmo's Restaurant &amp; Bakery 
and International House of Pancakes. 

I graded on a five-point scale. The 
restaurants were all graded on atmosphere, 
menu and variety, service, tune, presentation 
and food, proportioning and price of the 
meal, and over-

inside you realize why: this 
was their answer to the smok-

restaurants within city limits. 
They don't have a closed off 
section for the smoking sec-

with cigarette smoke, I really 
don't recommend this place 
for you. The rest of the facility 
is plain. The atmosphere here 
is friendly; you have your

I gave them 2 points for

On to the good stuff— food, I 
ordered a full order of biscuits and 
gravy with a side of potatoes. The 
proportions were good, the gravy 
tasted a little bland, and the pota-

a very satisfying meal. The price 
for this visit was a whi&gt;ppm,;sS ly

Overall Willie's isa good plate

affordable lor a student budget. 

I give them a 2.5 overall 
grade. 

The next stop I made was at 
Bob Evan's at 1715 Apple Glen

the southern country theme. The

wait a little while for my food. It 
sat in the warmer window for a 
least 3 to 4 minutes before it was 
brought to me. I gave them 2

The presentation was some- 
what classy. It was dressed with a 
parsley garnish. 

The arrangement of food was 
very neat and orderly. 1 gave them

"Morning Light" which is one egg 
that I had them cook over hard, 
home fries, two pieces of bacon and 
wheat toast The egg was cooked 
to order, the home fries were 
cooked with a seasoning salt to 
almost perfection and the bacon 
was nice and crisp. 

The toasl was nicely hollered

had grape jelly, strawberry jam, a 
mixed berry jam and apple boiler

For my overall grade I was a

you do, keep these four places in 
mind. I'm sure they'll appreciate

First Person 

The day was January 24th 



By Michael Burman 

Special to The Communicator 

The last words my father 
spoke to me were "Mike, I hope I 
can die tonight." 

There is a saying: "The cure is 
worse than the disease." In my 
eight years as a Dialysis Repair 
Technician, I saw that scenario play 
out many rimes. I witnessed the 
suffering some renal patients go 
through because of their treatment. 
A case could be made that the treat- 
ment, dialysis, is worse than the 
disease itself. It's a four-hour, 
thrice weekly ordeal that can leave 
the patient weak and nauseous, 
and totally disrupt the body's 
chemical levels. Extreme diet con- 
trol, vomiting, severe itching, ago- 
nizing cramping, endless medica- 
tions and continual blood work are 
some of the more pleasant side- 
effects. Kidney disease is often 
associated with diabetes, so 
patients who are blind or missing 
several body parts are not uncom- 
mon. Unless a patient is lucky 
enough to get a transplant, he will 
never improve. Many decline until 
the prospect of death becomes an 
attractive alternative. Some choose 
to discontinue treatment, knowing 
that in a few days, they will be 

I say all of this to help the 
reader understand that to a suffer- 
ing patient, death can be preferable

t In- 



patient needs to be told that it's OK 
to let go. Such was the case with 
my father. 

Dad was not a renal patient 
He was a smoker. At 67 years of 
age, he had survived several bouts 
of cancer that had attacked various 
parts of his body. But 

peared in his throat, 
and spread to his 
lungs, kidneys and 

lymphatic system. In 



,-nih - 



he 



had gone from being 
able to drive his white 
Trans-Am and receive 
visitors, to being too 
weak to make it to the 
bathroom by himself. He required 
a visiting nurse. But in order to 
qualify for that service, he had to 
have a twenty-four hour caregiver, 
me. Dad lived in Knoxville, so I 
needed a couple of days to- get 
some affairs in order at home and 
drive down there to live until the 
situation resolved itself. I had 
asked one of Dad's friends to 
phone when things started to get 
bad. The call finally came around 
January 12th. 

When I had visited just before 
Christmas, Dad was still function- 
ing pretty well. At first, conversa- 
tion was uncomfortable for both of 
us. We both knew he was dying, 
but neither of us wanted to be the 
first to say it out loud. Gradually 
though, we worked into it, and it 
became OK to talk about. He told 
me that he was "anxious to visit 
people he hadn't seen in a while," 
referring to his dead relatives. I 
was the executor of Dad's will, so 
he told me what he wanted done 
with his finances. He signed over 
his prized Trans-Am to me. We 
made arrangements at the crema- 



tion facility. He seemed satisfied 
that his wishes would be honored. 
Except for the specter of his 
impending death, it was a pleasant 

When I returned in January, 
things were much worse. Dad was 
too weak to get off the pull-out 
couch he slept on because of it's 
proximity to the downstairs bath- 
room. 1 had to help him through 
the process. Because the cancer 
was in his throat, it was agony tor 
him to swallow his pain medica- 
tions. Neither could he eat. In the 
time I was there, he ingested only a 
half a glass of white grape juice, 
three teaspoons of ice-cream, and 
some protein shakes provided by 
the hospice. His weight loss made 
him appear skeletal. The hospice 
was ready for him whenever he 
decided it was time, but he was 
determined to stay in his apart- 
ment as long as possible. Every 
day, I would ask him, "Dad, what 
do you think?" He just replied, 
"No, not just yet." 



jng worsened. 
Because of his 

inability to 

swallow, he was 
fitted with a 

pump. 



We both knew h 
was dying, but 
neither of 
wanted to be the 
first to say it out 
loud. 



He '

set too low, so it didn't help. I did- 
n't know how to adjust it, so he just 
laid there in quiet agony, with his 
hands drawn up under his chin. I 
did what I could, but lacking train- 
ing, I was of only marginal help I 
answered his e-mails, paid bills, 
did laundry, updated his friends, 
watched ESPN Speed-Vision with 
him, and anything else I could 
think of. None of it eased his suf- 
fering. After several days, I needed 
a break, but my discomfort was 
nothing compared to what he was 
going through. 

Finally, late Wednesday, 
January 23rd, after a particularly 
difficult day, he decided that it was 
time to go. We had completed our 
business and made our peace with 
each other, so I made the phone 
call. That evening, in the rain, the 
ambulance came and got him. I 
followed along in the Trans-Am, 
nearly wrecking it twice on the wet 
roads. The hospice staff got him 
settled in, and medicated. I was 
exhausted, and had planned to 
sleep on the couch in Dad's room. 
But because the nurses had things 



well in hand, and the fact that I 
didn't want my snoring to disturb 
Dad, I decided to return to the 
apartment, get some sleep and 
come back in the morning. 

I stood beside Dad's bed and 
told him that 1 was leaving and 
would see him in the morning. 
That's when he confessed his 
desire to die during the night. I 
couldn't understand his suffering, 
but I did understand his desire for 
it to be over. I paused to collect 
myself, and then told him that 1 
disagreed with his sentiment, but if 
he felt that it was time for him to 
go, I understood and wouldn't 
hold it against him. With that, I 
left. I returned to the apartment, 
nearly wrecking the car, yet anoth- 
er time. When I arrived, I got 
ready for bed, set the alarm for 
seven o'clock a.m. and went to 

The phone woke me at 6:55 
a.m. It was January 24th. The 
voice at the other end informed me 
that they were sorry, but Dad bad 
just died. He had awakened feel- 
ing somewhat better and asked the 
nurse for a glass of water. She 
went into the hall to get it. When 
she returned 15 seconds later. Dad 
was dead, his suffering over. Dad 
once told one of his friends that he 
didn't want to die with me around, 
thinking it would upset me" I 
guess he was just wanted a little 
privacy. Still, I wish I had been 

Dad chose to be cremated. He 
wanted no funeral. So in early 
April, his friends and I organized a 
memorial service. It was a chance 
for them to say "good-bye." Dad's 
favorite place was a certain body of 
water, which shall remain 
unnamed, due to possible illegali- 
ties that occurred there. Every 
summer, he and his friends would 
rent two large houseboats and 
spend a week there. We gathered 
at the dock, took a chilly pontoon 
boat ride to a secluded spot, told 
some stories, cried a little, and then 
poured Dad's ashes into the lake. 
Someone brought a few of Dad's 
homemade firecrackers along and 
shot them off, terrorizing the wild 
life. It was good. 

I required two things from 
each of those in attendance: 

1. Whenever they passed that 
spot, they must share a drink with 
Dad by pouring some beer into the 
lake. 

2. Out of respect for Dad's 
now submerged ashes, they must 
never again pee in the lake. They 
all promised. .

Support the IPFW Mastodons 

Special to The Communicator 

IPFW wants you to become a member of our athletic program. 

Whether you are an athlete or not, you should come out and sup- 
port the Mastodons in all their home events, just follow your way 
to the Tar Pit. IPFW is recruiting members to ensure the Tar Pit is 
jammed packed with rowdy supporters. 

"There is nothing like having a ton of fan support at a game," 
senior basketball guard Keion Henderson said. 

"The student section brings an important feature to the game, 
being the Sixth Man. Having good fan support helps bring the team 
into another state of mind on the court. The fans really help us out 
in some tough situations," Henderson added. 

Senior forward Jim Kessenich agrees. "The level of play always 
goes up when there are a bunch of rowdy fans cheering us on. The 
louder and noisier the fans are, the better advantage we hold over 
visiting teams," Kessenich said. 

IPFW has lined up several events for the students in the Tar Pit. 
Several giveaways and activities are already planned for the upcom- 
ing seasons, including giving away a big screen television. 

"This is a great opportunity for students to have fun and let loose 
outside the classroom. This season we have instituted a student 
reward system, and will be delivering a product the fans can really 
get behind," Brian Miller, director of promotion, said.

IU football: 38,000 students, 80 
scholarships, no players, no point 



By Justin Kenny 

The Communicator 

Things just can't get much 
worse for Indiana football. 

After their 38-13 walloping at 
the hands of Washington last 
Saturday, the hapless Hoosiers are 
now 0-2, heading into a showdown 
this week against powerhouse 
Indiana State. Yeah, THAT Indiana 
State. And the sad thing is, I'm still 
not sure who I'm going to pick. 

Hoosier football stinks. And I 
don't mean good stink, as in a 
woman's perfume or the smell of 

They lost their opener to the 
University of Connecticut, a team 
that has been in Division I for a 
legacy-building one year. 

The 34-10 loss at the hands of 
Uconn showed once again that 
Indiana football isan embarrass- 

Indiana University is huge. 
Over 38,000 students call IU their 
home from August to May, and 
you are telling me they can't find 
80 people who can play football? 

How can this sport lag behind 
all others al a. university that prides 
itself on athletics? 

Watching the game on 



Saturday [that was for some reason 
on ESPN2) Indiana looked a lot like 
a team I used to be a part of about 
ten years ago. False starts, players 
not knowing where to be, not 
enough players on the field, or too 
many; yup, looked a lot like my 
PAL team, the Cowboys. Mind 
you, we were eleven years old. 

This isn't anything new to 
Indiana football fans. For years this 
program has been dormant 
Hoosier faithful celebrate when a 
two-star athlete commits to the 
Hoosiers, then watch him leave for 
Ohio State after a single year to join 
l he Hutkeves as a walk-on. 

Linebacker John Kerr, who led 
the Hoosiers in tackles last season, 
is gladly paying for his college per- 
sonally instead of a full-ride at 
Indiana, purely to be on a team that 
actually knows how to play foot- 
ball. 

Head coach Gerry Dinardio is 
trying is best. But when you can't 
even give out all your scholarships 
to high school seniors because no 
one wants to come there,you can- 
not really build the program. 

On the other hand, apparently 
when you speak to fans of Hoosier 
football, if only former coach Bill 



Mallory would return to the 
Indiana sidelines. They talk about 
this guy like he was Knute Rockne. 
His career record was 68-75-3. 

That would get you fired at 
any of the top 20 programs in the 
country, but yet it would be astro- 
nomical and cause for rioting on 
the Indiana campus if he would 
return to lead the Hoosiers to 
another .500 season, Mallory's 

With quarterback Antwann 
Randel El at the helm, at least 
Indiana was worth watching. 

Of course they would still lose 
by a couple touchdowns, but at 
least you could see a guy that 
would eventually make it as a wide 
receiver for the Pittsburgh Steelers. 

Now all you can watch is 
washout former Notre 

Damequarterback Matt LoVecchio 
lead a stagnant offense while the 
defense gets its three minutes of 
rest before going out and giving up 
another 80-yard scoring drive. 

It's a sad state of affairs in 
Bloomington. Indiana scheduled 
Indiana State to help out a fledging 
program, but who is REALLY get- 
ting the help? The Hoosiers or the 
Sycamores?
