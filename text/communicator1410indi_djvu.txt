Knowledge suffers

Much has been said aboul high 
technology recently, especiallv here In 
Fori Wnync. To hear some Icl) it, Ihe 
Uie riddle of Ihe ages iea in a 
microchip. 

The Fantus Company of Chicago 
suggested Fort Wayne should develop a 
high-Lech Indualrlal park. 

The Greater Fort Wayne Chamber of 
Commerce followed Uiii 

iligaling the poasiblllly of 
, bringing a high-tech center to Fort 
J Wayne to provide high-lech education 
and Job training with the ; ' 
IPFW and other inatitutions of higher 
learning, 

Stnte representatives James Hunt, 
Richard Worden and Phyllis Pond said 
training In computer technology and 
other lechnicalskills is where Uie future 
of a college education lies. 

What they said may be true, but whal 
about those high school and college 
sludcntswhoare still in doubt as to what 
choose. Not everyone wanis to 
study computer technology. 

Institutions ol higher learning should 

provide an education in high tech, but 

'. Ihcy cannot place too much emphasis on 

I l(. OUicr arca.&gt;i of study should be 

; promoted as well. 

; There is nu doubt high tech is prac-

At (he beginning of Ihe 1962 faU

composition along with math, speech 
and others are classes students should 
and must lake, even to graduate with a 
degree in computer technology, English 
and linguistics, communications, 
philosophy, and anthropology are 
programs, among others, that should be 
promoted by the

Needs in particular fields 
education will come and go. For a

must also be well-rounded. IPFW is not 
just training studenla to be engineers,

training students to be human beings,

The I2o,0CO carillon, cus-

said. It Is among Ihe many 
new and welcome additions 
to Ihe Music Departmmt,

"We have really seen the 
Music Department grow." 
Robertson said. "We used to 
teach in the basement of

We felt very temporary lor 
about three years. Finally, 
we made the move lo Netf.
