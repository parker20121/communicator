VOL. XXIV, ISSUE IS 



Indiana University-Purdue University at Fort Wayne 



)anuary14, 1993 



IPFW community seeks changes in Management Agreement 



The IPFW Faculiy Scnaic unani- 
mously approved 10 amend die Man- 
agemcm Agrccmcni with lU and Pur- 
due, and 10 seek fiscal autonomy aflcr 
monihs of ncgoliaiion. 

The Management Agreemcni is a 
legal documeni defining Ihe roles of 
ihc two universities sharing die JPRV 
campus. Every five years the docu- 
meni is renewed. TTie current agree- 
ment expires in July. 

The Management Agreement autho- 
rizes the formation of Ihe Community 
Advisory Council with members cho- 
sen by cither one of die presidents 
from lU or Purdue. The university 
president not involved in die member 
selection along with the IPFW chan- 
cellor can suggest appointees. 



Presently, 28 area conununily leaders 
serve on the council. 

The Council discusses community 
and campus concerns with IPFW 
Chancellor Laniz. but the actual fu- 
ture planning for IPFW is discussed 
only by the presidents of lU and Piu'- 
due. excluding Chancellor L^intz. Ad- 
ditionally, the day-to-day operation of 
the campus is lightly controlled by 
Purdue West Lafayette policy and 
budget restraints. 

What kinds of control are imponani 
to West Lafayette? Mandating the 
colors of the walls, forbidding deco- 
rative clocks in student lounges, and 
insisting that only deceased col- 
leagues (not living ones) can have 
rooms named in Uieir honor, are Uirec 
examples of the many ways fiscal 
control is maintained at IPFW. 

Purdue President Bccring called Ihe 



IPFW faculty and administration "ar- 
ticulate malcontents" according to 
William G. Frederick, IPFW associ- 
ate professor of computer science, 
and presiding officer of the Faculty 
Senate. He believes fleering has litde 
understanding of the unique reeds of 



intend to stay in the area aficr gradua- 
tion," Frederick explained. "If Bccr- 
ing owned a shoe store, he would car- 
ry only one style and one size." he 
said. 

Frederick is noi alone in his opin- 
ion. Michael C, Do*tis, chair of po- 



"IfBeering owned a shoe store, he would carry only one style 

and one size."

IPFW students. Trying to duplicate 
West Lafayette's traditional student 
needs with IPFW's non-traditional 
students is laniamount 10 forcing die 
wrong shoe on the wrong foot at 
IPFW, 

"Our students are siatisucally older. 
most have families, and die majority 



litical science, agrees that it is an in- 
appropriate arrangement for IPFW. 
the fifdi largest public university in 
Indiana. 

"Wc have to work through a Purdue 
bureaucracy for whom wc are an af- 
tcrdiought," Downs revealed. 

The new six member IPFW Council 



proposed by the Faculty Senate even- 
tually would change all thai. Two 
members would be appointed by the 
presidents of lU and Purdue, two 
chosen by the IPFW chancellor, and 
two members elected by IPFW grad- 
uates. Furdicrmorc, the 1PF\V chan- 
cellor would meet widi die other two 
presidents and lake the major role in 
assessing and implementing relevant 
needs for this canipus. Any agree- 
ments between the two universities 
and IPFW would require die signa- 
tures of the IPFW chancellor and the 
chief financial officer — signatures 
presendy not allowed. 

Fiscal autonomy and the new man- 
agement agreement are related, but 
different issues. The proposed IPFW 
Council would allow IPFW much 
greater planning autonomy. Fiscal au- 
tonomy asks both lU and Purdue 10 



trust IPFW 10 manage its own money. 

Steve Hollander, associate professor 
of English, summed it up by compar- 
ing academic autonomy (which 
IPFW has had for 20 years) with fis- 
cal autonomy. "The trustees have 
granted us academic autonomy. We 
hire our own faculty, design and de- 
liver our own courses, construct our 
own curricula, and authori/.e die issu- 
ing of lU and Purdue diplomas that 
bear the words. Granted in Fori 
Wayne." 

"Now that we have proved our abil- 
ity to manage the futures of 12,000 
siudems. wc must be trusted to decide 
which chairs to buy for offices, what 
colors to paint our hallways, whether 
gay-bashing is 10 be prohibited, and 
other matters that our external fiscal 
agent has seen (it to decide for us." 

Next Week: Fiscal Autonomy 



King honored 

Campus celebrates birthday 



By Laura Line back 
Chief Reporter 

During the month of January. IPFW 
Multicultural Services is sponsoring 
events to commemorate die life and 
philosophy of the late civil rights 
leader Mariin Luther King. Jr.. who 
was assassinated 25 years ago in 
Memphis, Tennessee. 

Acliviiies include the Mariin Ludicr 
King, Jr. memorial service on Jan. 15 
at noon, a panel discussion ("The 
Civil Rights Movement Revisited") 
on Jan. 28. and a Gospel Fest on Jan. 
30. These special events will be held 
in the Walb Memorial Union. 

"TTie purpose of die Memorial Ser- 
vice is to celebrate the life of Manln 
Luther King. Jr. and to remember his 
accomplishments," 
said Bcttyc Poignard, 
director of Multicul- 
tural Services. 

"Most students are 
not old enough to be 
truly aware of die civ- 
il rights struggle. 
"Hiey are familiar widi 
King's accomplish- 
ments through bits 
and pieces dicy have 
read or heard about," 
Poignard explained. 

The Memorial Ser- 
vice is free and open 
to Ihe public. 

Kaiic Hall, former 
Indiana Isi District 
Congress woman from 
Gary, is Ihc speaker 
for die Memorial Ser- 
vice. She and Michi- 
gan Representative 
John Conycrs were in- 
strumental in legaliz- 
ing the birthday of 
Martin Luther King, 
Jr. as a public holiday. 

Hall has received 
more dian 300 awards 
for outstanding ser- 
vice in religion, edu- 
cation, politics, com- 
munity service, and 
legislative accom- 
pli shmenls. 

The program in- 
cludes music from 
IPFW senior music 
majors Geoffrey Kel- 
saw and Gordon Mar- 
tin; die African-Amer- 
ican Choral Ensemble 
of Snider High 
School: and Mi 
Stcrklcy and Carol 
Butler of the Baha' 
Temple. 

Poignard has seen the annual 
Memorial Service attendance grow 
significandy since its inception five 
years ago. The service, originally 
held in one of dtc second floor meet- 
ing rooms in Walb Union, was moved 
to the Ballroom 10 accommodate 
more dian five hundred persons. 

"In the civil rights movement, all 
kinds of people are involved, not Just 
African-Americans, This wc will ay 
to rcileci in the service - dial it is tru- 
ly multicultural," said Poignard. 

"The Civil Rights Movement Revis- 
ited: A Panel Discussion," will be 
centered around two put)lications: 
"Martin and Malcolm and America: 
A Dream or a Nightmare" by James 
H. Cone and "Free at Last: A History 
of the Civil Rights Movement and 
Those Who Died in die Struggle." 

Cone's t)ook compares die nonvio- 
lence philosophy of Dr. King and the 



philosophical viewpoint of Malcolm 
X, according to Charles C, Washing- 
ton, advisor for African-American 
students and coordinator for Master- 
ing die Possibilities at Multicultural 
Services. 

"Free at Last" is a documentary 
compilation of some of the lesser- 
known people involved in the civil 
rights movement. 

"Everyone has heard about Dr. King 
and Malcolm X, die more visible civil 
rights activists. But diis is about, for 
example, the four young ladies who 
died in die church bombing (in Birm- 
ingham following the March on 
Washington) and others you don't 
commonly hear about." Washington 
said. 

Panelists include James Rits, acade- 




mic affairs vice chancellor for Man- 
chester College, Wayne Township 
trustee Thomas Essex, Iman Tamir 
Rasheed. consultant Charles Redd. 
IPFW assistant professor of account- 
ing William H, Walker. Fort Wayne 
Dcvclopmenia! Center social worker peoples of all backgrounds about n 



"Other voices, not only by those 
who advocated nonviolence, were 
heard in ihc civil rights movement. 
The pane! discussion will education- 
ally benefit the student body and 
broaden their base of knowledge," 
said Poignard. 

Proceeds from The Gospel Fest. 
sponsored by the Black Collegian 
Caucus, will benefit die William Wat- 
son and Lcvan Scott scholarship 
funds. Past IPFW scholanhip rccipi- 
enis include Loreita Gadson, Harold 
Wims, Tracy Bunting, Geoffrey Kel- 
saw, and Angela Oitlcy. 

The Muldcultural Services Staff be- 
lieve that not only will the January 
events celebrate the life of Martin 
Ludier King, Jr. and present a history 
of the civil rights movement, but will 
also serve to educate 
people of all culiurc\ 
and races about thi 
concerns of minority 
groups. 

"Racism is very 
much alive and will 
affect all of us. Thoi^e 
who hate are affected 
also," said Poignard. 
"TV depictions of 
African- Americans 
many times are differ- 
ent from reality. Few 
programs point out 
the positive aspects 
of growing up 
African- American," 
she stated. 

Poignard feels thai 
racial tensions at 
IPFW are not as great 
as at other university 
campuses; however, a 
recent campus climate 
survey shows that 
lension exists. There 
.seems to l)e a greater 
misunderstanding (x- 
iwccn some faculty 
and minority studenLs 
dian between majority 
and minority students. 
Meetings with repre- 
sentatives of the ad- 
ministrative staff and 
faculty hopes to bring 
a greater sensitivity to 
this problem. Accord- 
ing to Poignard. coop- 
eration has been 
good. 

Webster believes 
that any actual ten- 
sions felt among peo- 
ples of differeni races 
can be eased by get- 
ting people acquaint- 
ed with one another. 
"A lot of misunderstanding is from 
ignorance and not knowing another 
(person) on an individual basis," said 
Webster, 

One of die objectives of die Multi- 
cultural Services office is to inform

Siaie Senator "Potch" Wheeler and 
State Representative Dan Stephan 
were guest panelists at the Legislative 
Breakfast in Huntington on Satur- 
day, Jan. 9. 

Stephan and Wheeler addressed 
IPFW issues. Both men agreed diat a 
SIO million budget cul for lU and Pur- 
due by the General Assembly this 
year is possible. 

When die moderator asked about fis- 
cal autonomy for IPFW. Stephan and 
Wheeler misunderstood the question 
and diought diat IPFW wanted to to- 
tally break away from receiving lU 
and Purdue degrees Oike die Universi- 
ty of Evansvillc), They agreed iJiat ii 
would t&gt;c a big mistake and cost the 
General Assembly more money to 
fund a new independent university, 

Widi die question clarified. Wheeler 
supported the idea that the IPFW 
chancellor and administration be al- 
lowed more input into the university's 
budget decisions, 

Steplian concurred, "If Purdue is in- 
sisting on mickey mousing every litde 
detail at IPFW, then that's outra- 
geous," 

Stephan concluded by encouraging 
Ihe IPFW community to give him 
more input and a show of support for 
fiscal autonomy this spring. 

Wheeler promised to see whai he 
can do to support fiscal autonomy ai 
IPFW.

Purdue controls 
IPFW funding 



byFellcbM. Beeching, 
Edllor-in-chief 

How would gaining fiscal auton- 
omy affcci smdcnis? This question 
is imponani lo eve^yon[^ on cam- 
pus because every day you arc liv- 
ing wiih Purdue decisions. 

IPFW seeks fiscal autonomy be- 
cause our best inieiests are not 
served by Purdue administrators. 
Their track record for IPFW is not 

Purdue dictates what we can and 
cannot ask for in a budget. If they 
feel it is irrelevant to their snident 
body, then it must be the same at 
IPFW, Our university is very dif- 
ferent from West Lafayette. They 
serve a traditional Student base, but 
the avCTage IPFW person is a non- 
u-aditional student. 

When our budget, as pan of Pur- 
due's budget, goes before the 
Higtier Education Commission and 
:r, the Genera! Assembly, our 
chancellor is nol allowed lo aucnd 
Ihe sessions wiih the West 
Lafayette administrators. Our 
IPFW Chancellor has no right to 
defend and explain IPFW budget 
requests. Only Wcsi Layfaycttc can 
do that. 

For example, the raiio of state ap- 
propriations for a full time equiva- 
lent (called FTE) snident ai IPFW 
averages S952 lower per siudcni 
than the average al 13 other simi- 
larly supported public insiiluiions, 
including IVY Tech. Thai toials a 
siaggciing S6.6 million in unappro- 
priated funds. Let me stress, thai's 
just asking for the average of what 
others receive. 

There's more. Purdue's student 
body directly pays through fees 
33% of their education; at IPFW, 
we pay a whopping 449i&gt;. Why is 
Purdue's fiscal management caus- 
ing us 10 pay so much more? 

For some students, dorms arc a 



real need; yei, Purdue considers the 
possibility of IPFW dorms a threat 
to Iheir enrollment. Our school is 
nol an extension campus; degrees 
are granted here. The majority of 
our undergraduate students are not 
going to finish their undergrad de- 
grees at West Lafayette or Bloom- 
inglon. 

Consider this. lUPUI, under the 
fiscal management of lU. has an 
enrollment of over 28,000 students, 
IPFW has less than half of that, or 
approximately, 12,000 students. 
lUPUI has over 1,781 regular fac- 
ulty. IPFW, under the fiscal man- 
agement of Purdue, has 332 regular 
faculty. Stunning fact! 

Did you know that Purdue has 
childcare faciliiies for their n-adi- 
lional smdeni base? Why can't wc 
have affordable childcare on this 
campus? Every other Indiana high- 
er education institution comparable 
to IPFW has childcare. We desper- 
ately need this budgeted into a 
fund by our fiscal parent to meet 
the needs of IPFW's mothers and 
fathers. Aren't our students as wor- 
thy of this service as Purdue's stu- 
dents? 

These are just a few of the areas 
where our "students will see in:\- 
provemenis if IPFW gams fiscal 
autonomy. 

When I spoke to State Represen- 
tative SlephAn and State Senator 
Wheeler at the legislative break- 
fast, they both urged me to tell the 
12,000+ IPFW faculty and students 
to write them letters. They want to 
know what we think about fiscal 
autonomy. 

After the three-part series is pub- 
lished in The Communicator, I 
hope you will write to them while 
the General Assembly is in session. 
Your letter might help contribute 
up to S6.6 million more someday 
for our campus.

Letters to the editor 



Unjust policy 

Student puzzled by 'meter 



aws 



To the Editor: 

Fellow students, it is once again 
lime to Stan another semester which 
means another five months of fighdng 
for a parking space in order to make 
it to class on time, Last semester I 
thought I had ticked the problem. I 
was running a little late for a class 
&lt;what else is new?) when I noticed a 
visitors' spot right next 10 Keitler 
Hall inviting me to park within its 
boun^arios. 1 took the bait. 

1 an^Hffit a ruthless, scruple-less 
person, so I performed my civic duty 
as a citizen of this great country and 
deposited my coins in the one-armed 
bandit meter. There was more than 
enough money in the meter to cover 
the amount of time that 1 would be 
gone and there were no signs stating 
"Visitors Chily" or "No B Permits." 
Many of you probably already know 
what was peeking out at me from un- 
der my windshield wiper when I exil- 



ed the building after my class. 

At first, I could not believe that I 
had gotten a lickei. I couldn't figure 
out what it was I had done. After all, 
1 had paid my money for the Space, 
and Ihe meter even showed that 1 had 
an additional five minutes left. When 
I finally did find out why I was penal- 
ized I still could not beheve it. 

I thought we students were visitors 
lo the school; oficrall. we don't live 
here. (Well, that too is a matter of 
opinion I suppose.} Regardless, if wc 
choose to pay for the space shouldn't 
we be able to park there? It seems to 
me that a visitor spot should be es- 
sentially open to any visitor to the 
school. 

I have paid my dues to the college 
for my B permit and am therefore 
able to park in a B lot. If I give the 
meter my dues for parking, I likewise 
should be able to park within its 
space. It is like a form of implied 



contract between the user and the me- 
ter. The user gives his or her consid- 
eration and receives the use of the 
space, a service. 

in all fairness, though, I do sec 
where an ordinance such as this may 
be needed. Afierall. some may take 
advantage of the visitor spots and use 
them on a regular basis, depriving the 
person who is without an A, B, C, or 
"Disabled" permit. However, if that 
■person pays for the use of that spot, 
then I feel as Uiough they should be 
allowed to park there, even if it is on 
a regular basis. The money is still be- 
ing collected and used for whatever 
purpose. In fact, more is being col- 
lected than if the space were empty 
for any length of time. Even if stu- 
dents were only allowed to park in 
these spots after the lime which most 
visitors were at the school, 8 a.m. to 5 
p.m. ! assume, then more utility 
would be gained from the space. 



Perhaps the solution lies with 
someone challenging this rule in an 
appeal or in court. However. I can't 
believe anyone would pay the attor- 
ney fees to challenge it in court, un- 
less the rule grates at their beliefs of 
what is an acceptable restriction and 
what is an infringement of a person's 
rights. In the meantime, I'll just be 
thankful for my rear-view mirror rc- 
mpyablctag, . , ;. ,, 

A couple of things I would like I6 
know include: 

1, Who develops these parking 
rules of ours anyway? The cam- 
pus police or some elected stu- 
dent body or the dean or what? 

2. Where does the money 
from the meters go? Road im- 
provements?

Family values defended 



To the Editor: 

In the last few months I've diought 
much about the idea of family values. 
Maybe it shouldn't be a political ide- 
al, but one of morals. It seems to be 
the norm of society lo come from a 
family of two parents, brothers and 
sisters; however, in recent years the 
number of divorces has risen. Along 
with this is the rising number of preg- 
nancies of unwed mothers without 
any help to raise their children. 

Throughout all of this I can find 
role models, individuals and families 
who realize how important the family 
really is. The other day while 1 was 
flipping through the cable channels, I 
ran across a man delivering a sermon 
in front of his church, I was inspired 
by his sttessing the need for people to 
stay together. Even the Clintons seem 
to recognize the importance of a 
strong family. Last summer when 1 



watched the nomination of Bill Clin- 
ton at Ihe Democratic National Con- 
vention I noticed one imporrani thing; 
the whole journey lo the convention - 
through hallways, the aowds of peo- 
ple, and up to the platform - rarely did 
I see Bill. Hillary, and Chelsea Clin- 
ton stop holding hands, 

I feel the Ointons realize how im- 
portant the family is just as much as 
the Quayles, The American public 
feels the moral foundation of the fam- 
ily is very important. Just look at 
what happened to Gary Hart in the 
primary for the 1988 election. Who 
can deny the family? It is the base of 
society and the bind that keeps it to- 
gether. And a family can exist 
whether one parent or two. although a 
man who leaves a woman alone to 
raise her children is no man at all,

AIDS facts available 



To the Editor: 

Recent studies suggest that college 
students are aware of HIV/AIDS, 
believe it is easily passed from one 
person to another, and can't believe 
it's a serious threat for them. The 
truth, of course, is quite different. 
HIV/AIDS is not easily passed on, 
but once a person is infected, there 
is no cure - and s/he will die. Drugs 
slow, but cannot stop the disease 
process. 

In the state of Indiana, over 2056 
persons have been diagnosed with 
die HIV infection. Of these. ?9 per- 
cent are in the age range 20 to 39. 
Nationwide, over 242,146 persons 
have been diagnosed with AIDS. Of 
these, 214,146 are male between the 
age of 20 to 39. (65 percent of total 
cases) and 27,831 are female be- 
tween the age of 20 to 39. (67 per- 
cent of total cases). 

Locally the AIDS Task Force 



Serving Northeast Indiana has 
worked with 440 men. women, and 
children and their loved ones who 
have been HIV/AIDS. Of these peo- 
ple 290 are living. 

What are the most recent 
about HIV/AIDS transmission? 
What are the chances of being in- 
fected? Docs one condom work bet- 
ter than another? The IPFW AIDS 
Education Committee will be offer' 
ing answers to these, and ' 
questions you may have. Each week 
of the spring semester. The Commu- 
nicator will feature "HIV/AIDS 
Questions and Answers." a question 
and answer forum. Send your ques- 
tion to Keitler G56A; no name

For sale: Year 'round New Year's resolutions 



1 



New Year's is one of my favorite 
holidays. And ii's not simply because 
i['s anoiher excuse to '"pany!" {You 
loiow how imponant a noun is in our 
society when it wrestles lis way into 
our vocabulary as a verb.) The mith 
is ihai we don't need an event as sig- 
nificani as The New 
Year to throw a party. 
American ingenuity can 
always come up with an 
excuse lo celebrate 
when we're feeling fes- 
tive. "Hey. it's Arbor 
Day! Let's have a 
keggcr!" 

Perhaps the most 
ama/Jng thing about 
New Year's Eve is the 
fact that you can get a 
bar full of druniu to not 
only chant in unison for 
10 seconds, but to coop- 
erate on something as 
elaborate as counting to 10 back- 
wards. 

Bui this touching display of human 
camaraderie is only one small pan of 
Ihc holiday's enchantment. 

There is a much more personal as- 
pect of the New Year that appeals to 
me. The ushering in of the New Year 
is a great time to reflect upon your 
life and lo ask yourself the really hiutl 
questions: What did I accomplish last 
year? What did I fail to accomplish? 
How much did I change? Was ii for 
the woree or belter? Why do we use 
the phrase "to usher in ihe New 
Year?" (I have this image in my mind 
of a man in an ugly faded gold suit 
potilely csconing the New Year down 
an aisle and seating it next to 1967. 
This is not a good illustration of how 
wc welcome the New Year. We arc 
never that gentle. Perhaps a more ap- 
propriate metaphor would be "to 
throw champagne on the New Year" 

n "lo drop a ball on the New Year'" 



Just A Theory 
by Tim Schreiber 



person can change in 365 days. When 
1992 was ushered in by a bad 
metaphor, I was a naive 20-year-old, 
a boy really, who thought that Dan 
Quayle was an idioi and Dave Barry 
was God. Now, however, I am a ma- 
ture 21-year-old. who, through a 
year's worth of cjtpcri- 
ences dealing with love, 
hate, politics, and get- 
ting caught going 77 in 
a 55 zone, knows that 
Dan Quayle is an idiot 
and Dave Barry is God. 
I learned many things in 
1992: 

I leamed thai turn- 
ing 21 doesn't automati- 
cally grow hair on your 
chest. 

I learned thai cast- 
ing a vote in a presiden- 
tial election doesn't nec- 



essarily make you feci 
like any less of an insignificant bit of 
spittle in an ocean of humanity. 

1 learned that happiness comes from 
the little things, like all the charges 
being dropped. 

1 learned Ihai Communists don't 
scare me. but people who go lo na- 
tional conventions and cheer for their 
favorite political pany as if ii's a 
football team do scare me. 

1 learned that Dan Quayle debates 
with all the eloquence of a 3rd grader, 
"Oh yeah?! Well, my presidential 
candidate can beat up your presiden- 
tial candidate!" 

I also accomplished many things in 
1992, things that I never imagined 1 
would do. At the beginning of the 
year. I had no idea what 1 wanted to 
do with my life. Now I have at least 6 
or 7 ideas of what I want to do with 
my life. (Granied, ihcy are all contin- 
gent upon my winning the lottery, but 
ai least it's a sun.) 

I never imagined I would have my 
own column in a college newspaper. 



used car and call il Guniher. 

1 never imagined I would learn to 
like cottage cheese. (I eat it all the 
time, now. The trick is to not think 
about what it actually is. which is re- 
ally old milk.} 

1 never imagined I would watch an 
cniirc presidential debate without be- 
ing lied down to a chair and writhing 
in pain from pangs of boredom and 
utter indifference, and I would have 
actual opinions about it. 

I never imagined I would get an op- 
portunity to wail Dylan on a Karaoke 
machine. 

And I never imagined thai I would 
win a Pulitzer Prize and appear on 
The Tonight Show and tlicn return 
home to a crowd of screaming female 
fans, not unlike the greeting that the 
Beatles got when they first came to 
America. (Ttchnically. this didn't ac- 
tually totally truthfully happen, but 
it's also true that I never imagined it.) 

Bui the New Year is not only a time 
10 dwell on the past. It's a time to 



look ahead to die New Year, to won- 
der aloud in front of hundreds of peo- 
ple what 1993 has in store for me. 
How many limes will I smile, laugh, 
cry, sigh, shower, cat pizza, and 
change my major in the next year? 
Will 1 climb a mountain? Will 1 cure 
a disease? Will 1 finally buy a har- 
monica like I've been talking about? 
Will I write the Great American Nov- 
el? Or the Great American Short Sto- 
ry? How aboui the Great American 
Paragraph? 

One thing I don't anticipate doing 
this year is making any New Year's 
resolutions. It's noi that I think I'm 
perfect {I'm much loo short to be per- 
fect), it's jusi ihat I don't think New 
Year's resoluiions work. 

Tlie way I sec it. New Year's reso- 
lutiorts are token gestures invented by 
people like Stuart Smalley ("I'm 
good enough, I'm smart enough, and, 
gosh damit, people like me!") to in- 
spire feelings of smug self-righieous- 
ness. Maybe, for a handful of people. 



New Year's resolutions do help them 
better themselves. Bui for the general 
population, part of the tradition of 
New Year's resolutions is to forget 
that you even made one by February. 

Maybe wc are too hard on our- 
selves. Maybe instead of saying "I re- 
solve to lose 10 pounds," we should 
say. "I resolve to accept my glutto- 
nous human nature." 

Anoiher problem with New Year's 
resolutions is dial we only make them 
once a year. The truth is that you 
have thousands of faults. I could rat- 
tle off a dozen right now. and I don't 
even know you. So making one wee- 
nie little resolution a year will never 
cure you of all your shortcomings. 

Then how can you better yourself? 
Well. I'm glad you asked. Because, 
now, for a limited time, I am ofTcnng 
Tim's Year-Round Resolution Ser- 



vice. For a low. almost non-cxisient 
S25 fee. I will send you. at random 
limes throughout Ihc year, a quick 
and easy new resolution. If you want 
to lake advantage of this incredible 
offer, simply send me a naked picture 
of yourself and a few pages of your 
diary and/or journal (so I can find 
some of your faults), along with S35 
(ihe fee plus shipping and handling). 
Then wait excitedly next to your 
mailbox for your first resolution to 
airivc, via telepathic messages. 

Despite my resolutionless New 
Year. I am optimistic about 1993. 
There's a good possibiliiy that I've 
already written ihc Great American 
Paragraph, and in the process I might 
have stumbled onio the Great Ameri- 
can Get Rich Quick Scheme, The 
year's looking up already.

Getting ready for spring semester 



Just weeks after final construction work was completed 
on the engineering parking lot, seven inches of snow 
silently filled the streets of Fort Wayne early Sunday 
morning. 

In spite of the blizzard, students braved below freezing

Community members commemorate 
death of Martin Luther King jr. 



By Kay Hintia 
Features Editor 

It has been almost 25 years since 
Uie death of Martin Luiher King, Jr., 
yet he impacts the worldwide com- 
munity even today. He led (he 
African-Americans lo fight for 
change in a non-violent manner. 

King spoke out on war and poverty 
as well as civil rights. He once staled. 
"Being a Negro in America is not a 
comforiable c»is- 
icncc. Ii means be- 
ing a pan of the 
company of the

tered, the scarred,

hold on to physical 
life amid psycho- 
logical dcaih. It 
means the pain of 
watching your children grow up with 
clouds of inferiority in iheir mental 
skies. It mcaiu having your legs cut 
off, and then being condemned for 
■ being a cripple. It means seeing your 
mother and father spiritualty mur- 
dered by the slings and arrows of dai- 
ly exploitation, and then being hated 
for being an orphan. Being a Negro 
in America means listening to subur- 
ban politicians talk eloquenily against 
open housing while arguing in ihe 
same brcaih that they are noi racisis, 
It means being harried by day and 
haunted by nighi by a nagging sense 
of nobodincss and consianUy fighting 
10 be saved from the poison of biiier- 
ness. It means the ache and anguish 
of living in so many situations where 
hopes unborn have died." 

King helped to take away some of 
Ihe hopelessness fell by African- 
Americans as he led the fighi for 
rights. Beginning wiih ihe Mont- 
gomery Bus Boycott, and ending in 
Memphis, Tennessee. King preached 
non-violence. He said. "Violence as a 
way of achieving racial justice is both 
impraciical and immoral. Ii is im- 
practical because it is a descending 
spiral ending In destruction for all.

The old law of an eye for 
leaves everybody blind. Ii is immoral 
because it seeks to humiliate the op- 
ponent rather than win his under- 
standing; it seeks to annihilate raiher 
than 10 convert. Violence is immoral 
because it thrives on hatred rather 
than love, Ti destroys commimiiy and 
makes brotherhood impossible. It 
leaves sociciy in monologue rather 
than dialogue. Violence ends by de- 
feating itself. It creaies biiicmess in 
the survivors and 
bruialiiy in the de- 
stroyers," 

Local politicians 
and teachers still 
remember King, 

■'King's legacy 
made us all more 
aware of how we 
need to treat all hu- 
mans equally," said 
Senaior Dan Coais, 
"His message seni 
Ihe word for us to 
search our own 
hearts for how we 
treat others. We need lo focus on 
what he called us to do," 

Congresswoman Jill Long, when 
asked alwut King says, "It's impor- 
tant 10 remember someone who gave 
his life for equal opportunities and 
rights for all people." 

"Martin Luiher King, Jr. is one of 
my heroes," says Fort Wayne Mayor 
Paul Helmke. "I had the opporiuniiy 
to meet him when he spoke here in 
1963. I think a lot of progress has 
been made bui I siill ihink ihcre is 
racial prejudice and discrimination in 
society. It's more subtle than ii used 
10 be, but it still happens, I think we 
need to be, each of us needs lo be, on 
guard for ii in ourselves, in our 
friends, and work to understand that 
it's there, why it's there and what we 
can do to truly iieai people on an in- 
dividual basis radier than on a sterco- 
lypical racial basis or on some other 
basis thai doesn'i make sense," 



Fort Wayne Ciiy Councilman Cleius 
Edmonds says, "I think Reverend 
King was so effeciive because he 
chose to work within the system and 
changed the system through as nonvi- 
olent means as possible," 

Richard Johnson, IPFW Coordina- 
tor for Peace and Conflict Studies, 
said King grew a loi in his life, and 
thai he was "creative for the mo- 
ment" as a leader, writer and activist, 
widening to focus noi only on civil 
rights but on poverty and the Viet- 
namese War. 

A book edited by Corcita Scoit 
King, his wife, ends wiih these 
words; "When we allow freedom to 
ring, when we iei il ring from every 
village and every hamlei, from every 
stale and every city, we will be able 
10 speed up thai day when all of 
God's children, black men and while 
men. Jews and Gentiles, Proiestanis 
and Catholics will be able to join 
hands and sing in ihe words of the 
old Negro spiritual, "Free at lasi! 
Free ai last! Thank God almighty, we 
are free ai last!'"

Lady 'Dons play even bal 



By Michael Ba.ss 
SporlsEdllor 

Away the Lady 'Dons have been 
playing even ball, which was evi- 
dent on iheir Jaiesi road trip. They 
splii a pair, winning against Ken- 
lucky Wcslcyan by a score of 61-57. 
Then last Saturday ihey fell to 
Southern Indiana by 6 wiih a score 
of 78-72. 

Ai Owensboro Kentucky ihcy 
bcal Wcslcyan with 47 percent from 
ihe field. Tliey bcai down Wesleyan 
holding them to a lowly 38 percent 
from the field. 



The shooting was led by sentor 
Dawn Dressier who shot 9 of 15 and 
had 20 points lo end the game. 
Dressier was assisted by freshman 
Lindy Jones who had 12 points and 
8 rebounds. 

Saturday night in Evansville the 
learn lost to Southern Indiana in an 
afternoon game. Junior Amy 
Perkins shot 4 for 10 from ^c field 
and 8 for 11 from the line and led 
the team with 16 total points. 

Dressier again had a good 
night shooting 5 for II, but had 10 
rebounds. 

"It look some time to develop, but 




Dawn Dressier really 'rose lo the 
occasion," said Kleinfelter, con- 
cerning Dressler's recent play 
against Indianapolis and Northern 
Kentucky. 

Coach Klienfelicr feels that 
Dressier is emerging as the leader of 
her young inexperienced team. 
Dressier has earned the nickname 
Heady Steady Dawn for consistency 
and effort. 

"Gradually we are picking up the 
pace," said KIcinfcIicr, and as the 
season continues she feels good 
about the development of her Lady 
'Dons, and is optimistic on the long 
season ahead. 

"Each game we just get better," 
Kleinfelter says, "if we just do all 
the little things right we can win 

The Lady 'Dons are currently 5-7 
on the season and 2-2 in the GLVC 
conference. The IPFW women are 
6th in the conference. 

They will play 5-5 Ashland on 
Saturday, Jan. 16 at Ashland. The 
game begins ai 5: 15 pjn.

Mastodons lose heartbreaker 



By Michael Ba-SS 
Sports Editor 

The fourth ranked men's basketball 
team was dealt its first defeat last 
week. Then on Saturday they were 
handed another loss. 

The first loss of the season for the 9- 
2 Mastodons came at the hands of 
Kentucky Wesicyan, an away game 
that went down to the wire. Unfortu- 
nately for IPFW, Wcslcyan hit a three 
pointer and ended a nine game win- 
ning streak for IPFW. The final score 
was 69-66. 

Coach Andy Piazza had this to say 
on the loss, "That took a lot out of us 
cmouonally. The kids got their heans 
broken. They expected to win and 
they played to win." 

Piazza feels both teams came to the 
game to play hard. He was not too 
worried on how the loss will affect 
his team, and feels they will rebound 
pretty well frotn the losses.

Cheerleaders 



Squad excites crowd 



By Michael Bas^ 
Sports Editor 

As ihe game rages aaoss the coun, 
spc&lt;;uiors arc being drawn inio ihe 
game. TTicy begin yelling and jump- 
ing for Uic IPFW teams. 

The cause of Uiis building frenzy is 
Ihc dcicrminaiion and devoiion of 
another team,., ihat team is Ihc IPFW 
cheerleaders. 

Making all this happen arc 10 sru- 
denls who practice hard lo perfect 
the routines they do at icam home 
games. They cheer to motivate the 
fans into a mania of support, to en- 
thuse and excite the players on (he 
coun. 



"/ don't like Ihe way Ihe 
gym floor feels on my 
head." 

-Tom Volz 



The squad is made up of five ladies: 
Sandy VanMarkuyk, Amy Talarico, 
Jodi Johnson, Michcic Wcrling. and 
Dawn Vanallon. 

The men include: Jim Rowland, 
Greg Cole, Tom Vol?, Kevin Ousley. 
and Matthew Lorscn. 

e team practices two times a 
week for an hour and a half. In prac- 

cc they U7 new moves and routines 

J make their cheers more exciting. 

Squads arc picked once a year dur- 
ing early spring. Cynihia Sigman, 
first semester coach, expressed a 
need for certain qualifications in or- 
o become a cheerleader. 



Coach Sigman said a person needs 
some gymnastic ability, not to men- 
tion lots of enthusiasm and a loud 
voice. 

Like any other spun, checrlcading 
can be dangerous. Sigman believes 
that there arc more injuries in her 
team's spon tJian in other spons. 

Both the guys and girls of the team 
know the dangers ihey face. One mo- 
ment of lost concentration could 
mean trouble for a cheerleader being 
held up by her partner. Spotters have 
to be ready to catch a falling member 
on a second's notice. 

Tom Volz summed ii up for the 
team by saying, "I don't like the way 
the gym floorfeels on my head." 

The learn of men and women arc 
there on the sidelines of almost every 
men's basketball home game. 

They believe their job is appreciat- 
ed by few. All they want is for the 
students, the faculty, and the staff to 
come out and cheer with them for the 
leam on the coun. They don't want 
the attention for themselves but for 
the other teams. 

On crowd panicipation Amy T^ari- 
co said, "It's nol for our benefit but 
for the team, because the team really 
docs deserve it." 

"We arc not here for show; we real- 
ly do work hard," said Dawn Vanal- 
lon. "The end result is 10 gel the 
crowd into Ihe game." 

The cheerleaders will continue go- 
ing to men's basketball games. They 
express a desire for more students at 
IPFW to come to the games and root 
for the home team.

What name has he donned? 



By Michael Bass 
Sports Editor 

IPFW has this real neat mascot, it's 
elephani-likc, but is covered with 
stufT that's like wool. He's been seen 
running around campus, but he is 
seen mostly at spons games in the 
Hilliard Gates Athletic Center. He is 
a... um..,that is. ..oh yea. He's a 
masiodon. 

A giant creature from pre-hisioric 
times. His bones are showcased in 
Kettler Hall. He stands for IPFW. but 
most people don't even know his 
name. 



In a poll of iOO students and staff, 
only 20 percent knew his name. Sev- 
enty-one percent of the people polled 
had no clue. This creamre of ancient 
times represents everything IPFW 
stands for and 71 percent did not 
know his name! 

Others guessed. Three percent 
thought his name was Snuffle -upagus. 
two percent thought Woolly, and oth- 
ers guessed Molly, Many, and Mike. 

What name has this aeature donned

know? Debbie Beck, a student at

I^miA^A Purdue Studeict GovEiu^Eiirr Associahoii^^ 




from the 
president's desk: 



Dear Students, 



Welcome to all of those students attending IPFW for the first time 
this semester, and thank you for selecting IPFW as your University. 
Welcome back to all of you who are returning this spring. 

As we pause midway through the year, 1 would like to re-cap 
what your student government is doing for you. Indiana Purdue 
Student Government Association (IPSGA) deals with all matters 
which directly affect the quality of education and the quality of 
student life at IPFW. Some of the things accomplished or provided 
for you thus far are; 

- A student discount package consisting of a listing of various 
area vendors who provide discount products and services to 
you. 

- A voluntary service board for philanthropic services. 

- Regular campus activities such as weekly movie series, 
alternative movie series, lectures, dances, fun flicks, caricature 
artists, bands, food give-aways. Breakfast With Santa, mid-day 
diversions, and many others. 

- Funding for The Communicator. The PIT, the Forensic League, 
The Lecture Series, and the Fine Arts Department. (A report on 
organizational funding and funding for the five aforementioned 
groups will soon be released.) 

- Regular Campus Calendar in The Communicator informing you 
of the activities taking place on campus. 

- Typewriter rental service for students. 

- Student representation on various university, administrative, and 
faculty committees. 

Student Government is also dealing with other important issues 
such as child care, student fees, accessibility of the university 
administration to students, dorms on campus, and campus 
atmosphere for minorities. 

On the issue of child care, IPSGA has frozen all the money 
refunded due to the withdrawal of IPFW from the Child Care 
Consortium until recommendations are received from the Child 
Care Task Force. Student concerns regarding child care are also 
being voiced in the Task Force through IPSGA's Vice President for 
Legislation. 



IPSGA has also reviewed the Athletic Department's request for 
an increase of the student service fee and has decided to recom- 
mend against any increases on the currently assessed fee on under- 
graduate students. 

In addition, IPSGA has joined efforts by the student governments 
of all universities in the State of Indiana that receive state funding, 
to lobby for increased state funding and lesser fee increases on 

students. 

We are ready to begin a new survey for the need assessment of 
dorms on campus. 

IPSGA is attempting to bring the university administration closer 
to the students. In this regard, initiative has been taken to hold 
open town hall meetings where students will have an opportunity 
to meet university administrators and voice their concerns on vari- 
ous issues. The first meeting in this series will be held in February. 

IPSGA has formed a task force to study the campus climate for 
minority students and give its recommendations for improvements. 

The organization, "Presidential Roundtable," has been reestab- 
lished. This organization consists of presidents of all recognized 
student organizations, and is entrusted to discuss the campus 
atmosphere, the needs of the students, and the upcoming campus 
agenda. 

IPSGA is working to provide IPFW students with a say in the 
selection of the "Student Trustees" for the lU Board of Trustees 
and the Purdue University Board of Trustees for the term 1993-95. 

In the coming semester, expect IPSGA to address the following 
issues: 

- Spring Kickoff 

- TV for the new E&amp;T building lounge 

- Earth Day festivities and events 

- Legal aid services for students 

- Health Clinic 

IPSGA, through its four branches - the executive branch, the leg- 
islative branch (Senate, which is charged with addressing the needs 
of the student body through legislation), the programming branch 
(SAB, which deals with the social and programming activities of 
and for students), and the judicial branch are pledged to uphold 
students' rights and ideals. IPSGA meetings are advertised regularly 
in the Campus Calendar and through flyers. I strongly encourage 
you to join Student Government or any of the university-wide com- 
mittees which require student members. Take an interest in having 
a voice in your educational experience at this university. 

Student Government exists for you. Your participation, sugges- 
tions, comments and criticisms are needed for IPSGA to be an 
effective voice of the student body. 

FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO 
STOP BY MY OFFICE, WALB 225-B, OR CALL ME AT 
481-6588. 

Sincerely, 



Rajat Suri 

President of the Student Body
