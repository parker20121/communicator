Lagoon proposal 

The efforts of students and faculty to clean up the lagoon, while commendable, 
high-light an intolerable situation that exists at (he Indiana-Purdue Univenty. 

The lagoon was intended to be the focal point of the entire campus. We not only 
agree with that intent, but feel the planners of the physical lay-out of this campus 
showed real perception and a feel for the environment by taking advantage of the 
natural lagoon as a central feature of the entire campus. 

Somewhere between the point of planning and f 
ecology of the lagoon was disturbed, cr&lt; 
immediately in front of the Student Union. 

Plans have been formulated to have that urea dredged, ; 
some $200,000. Due to (he large expense involved, 
74, this effort has been postponed, leaving an unsightly i 

The Indiana-Purdue Communicator has developed 
alternative to the present plan. Our plan not only would ins 
the lagoon, but also would save nearly all of the money pre 1 
cost of completing the lagoon. 

Our plan centers on a natural slope-grading of the eastern end of the present 
cavity, encompassing an area roughly 270' x 200'. The plan would call for filling in 
that much area with a sloping bank to the present edge of the natural lagoon. 
Several trees in this plot would have to be raised and re-planted, which would be 
the most expensive item of the plan, but this is still minimal, compared to the 
dredging plan. 

The present cavity, even with the gates of the dam on the St, Joseph's River 
closed, most likely would not fill completely with water even after the dredging 
operation. Our plan would eliminate the need for any dredging expense, what- 
soever. The marshy area would be filled in, and the natural environment preserved. 

The plan has been discussed with technical experts as to it's feasibility, and all 
agreed it was the most simple method of completing the project. The cost es- 
timates. including the relocation of some twenty beautiful trees in the problem 
area, range up to a ceiling of $20,000. 

The plan has tentative approval of the Students' Government, and has been dis- 
cussed with Dr. Jerry Boswell, chairman of the Board of Public Works for the city 
of Fort Wayne, who also agreed the plan has merit. He was involved in the original 
planning of the physical lay-out of the campus, including the lagoon, and his ap- 
proval of our suggestion is significant. 

Dr. Boswell showed his concern for the lagoon completion by appearing at the 
Lagoon Day clean-up effort. 

1973 has found a new dynamism on campus. Formerly dormant organizations 
are showing signs of a new spirit of accomplishment. 

We expect the administration to show this same dynamism in its consideration 
of our proposal. It is the rcsponsiblity of the administration to give prompt con- 
sideration to the proposal and to announce publicly its decision. 



Parking 



The Department of Safely and Security has dom a eommendahlc job in making 
the roadways of this campus safer. They have posted many signs to insure s-afer 
traffic conditions and to make parking somewhat easier. 

One thing the department has overlooked is the person who must come to the 
campus only to drop a paper or to renew a library book To this person assigned 
parking becomes u distinict pain. 

If a person is going to spend only a few minutes in a building, he must park in the 
proper lot. unless he wishes to chance a parking ticket One could only imagine the 
ordeal a person with a free lot slicker must undergo it he finds him -elf without any 
change for a parking meter. Even those with A and B permits, many times, must 
search to find a space near the building in which he wishes to spend only a few 



The worst example of this is the t hild Care Center. M 
children often times find themselves walking great i 
extremely heavy loads With had weather in the offing, t

Special parking spaces sin mid he provided lor persons intending to spend a few 
minutes at any given building. Two or three spaces would not cut out too many 
regular parking spaces. 

In fact, as this campus grows larger par king ol this type is almost needed for the 
persons with many errands to run. 

Parking spaces as these would allow anyone to complete his errand injuslafew 
minutes. These spaces will be very convenient for an errand-only parker.

It's that ime of year again when all good sports writers must reveal their predic- 
tions for the professional football season. So with no further hesitation, I offer my 
picks for 1973, starting with the National Football Conference East Division. 

NFC EAST 
1. Philadelphia Eagles — Last year the Eagles scored 352 points and held the op- 
position to a mere 145 — or was it the other way around? Anyway, with such super 
stars as running back Po James and receiver Ben Hawkins, how can the Eagles go 
wrong 9 Roman Gabriel, sore arm and all. may well be past his prim 



the i 



: East. 



2 Philadelphia's chief rival will be the St. Louis Cardinals. With a solid 
backbone of speedy Lou Brock, muscular Joe Torre, and quarterback Bob Gib- 
son, the Cards should make a strong run at the Eagles. 

3. Dallas Cowboys — Every department except kicking is above average: but it 
remains to be seen whether above average play will send the Cowboys into the 
playoff:, this year. 

4. New York Giants — Defense in the key. If it improves, I 
arrived. Head Coach Alex Webster asscrls, "The Giants ha'

NFC CENTRAL 

1. Chicago Bears — Bobby Douglas says, "I'm as good as any thrower around." 
Last year he completed W", of Ins losses. Newly-acquired CarKiarrett is bound to 
help. But, as for the many holes remaining in the Bears' attack, what of it? 

2. Detroit Lions — Adequate offense and highly questionable defense will spell a 
7-7 log for the Lions. And 7-7 will not send them into the playoffs this year. 

3. Minnesota Vikings — Tarkcnton will make Ihis aging (cam tough again, but 
their season will not likely exceed .500. 

4. Green Bay Packer— Fine running, defense, and kicking highlight this year's 
Pack. But who can beat a team with the mvicible Bobby Douglas on it?
