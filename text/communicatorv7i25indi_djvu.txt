Opinion 



Radio WIPFW? 

There are discussions under way to consider the \k&gt;--.' ibilih ol &lt; rciting a radio 
station at IPFW. 

While there are definite plans to gel a station on the air, nothing definite has 
been decided b&lt; his point Plans seem to be centering around Ihe feasibility of a 3000 
watt station that will serve the immediate environs of the campus, as well as the 
greater Fort Wayne area Definite recommendations concerning type of 
programming, hours of operation, and general type of audience to be sought at a 
later dale. Plans are centering on submission of an application for a broadcast 
frequency and invtsi motion of ihe lol.il ensi of pulling a station on the air. 

The discussion now under way have the approval of Chancellor Donald 
Schwartz If there is any way the university can generate the necessary funds for a 
radio station, the Chancellor seems committed to that possibility. 

There are many reason- for n public radio diantn'l in the Fort Wayne area. A 
poll undertaken in r.i?:! showed lhal many civic and business leaders in the area 
enthusiastically approved the concept, and the community can be looked to for 
major support in this effort. 

The Chancellor and the university community are to be commended for lis 
efforts so far. We would hope that the present invi'stigaiiun culminates in a 
decision to proceed with the development of a "WIPFW'for the Fort Wayne area.
