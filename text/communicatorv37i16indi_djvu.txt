IPFW's Family Health 
Clinic taking new clients 



The Lafayette Street Fam- 
ily Health Clinic, a nurse practitioner 
managed facility, is now taking new 
clients. The clinic offers a wide vari- 
ety of care to males and female* who 
have reached maturity, even those who 
are uninsured. 

Jennifer Bowers, director of 
IPFW Lafayette Street Family Health 
Clinic, explains rhal the clinic is simi- 
lar to a Planned Parenthood facility, 
"We receive the government funds thai 
Planned Parenthood used to receive. 
So that we may offer the free and dis- 
counted services. Planned Parenthood 
Is still there, but they don't really offer 
(he free services anymore." 

The services provided by 
the clinic range from family planning 
to reproductive health examinaiions. 
Also given at the location are birth 
control, pregnancy tests and emer- 
gency contraceptives. The fees for 
the services are based on family size 
and income. Bowers said that those 
who need to use the facility may do 
so as much as needed. "If someone is 
worried about a Sexually Transmitter 
Disease, we offer testing. Also, we 
encourage people to get tested for HIV 
every three to six months." 

Those who are interested in 
visiting The Lafayette Street Family 
Health Clinic are encouraged to make 
appointments, however, walk-ins 
.are acceptable. The clinic, which 
located at 2700 South Lafayette Street 
Suite 200, is open Monday, Wednes- 
day and Thursday from 8 a.m. to 5 
p.m.; Tuesday from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m.; 
and Friday from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. For 
more information, contact Lafayette 
Street Family Health Clinic at 260-

Men's Volleyball: "Unity Will Win Us The Championship This Year" 

The IPFW Mastodons Prepare For A Second 
Record-Breaking Season With Team Spirit, Togethernes 



As the 2007 season opened 
for "Amie's Army" this past weekend 
against Saint Francis and Penn State 
,the resounding message coming from 
the team was unity-which is a quality 
that both coaches and players agree 
will help lead them to a champion- 
ship title, as well as overall harmony 
throughout the season. 

The Mastodons 3-0 win 
against Penn State on Saturday proved 
that they are well-placed, ranking sev- 
enth in the country and within reach of 
their goal of dominating the Final Four 
asjiiin ihis season. 

"There is definitely a lot of 
pressure and we have a big target on 
our chests within the conference. Last 
year we were underdogs, and now our 
job is to defend our title. It will not 
be handed to us on a silver platter and 
we know that we will have to work for 
it," said junior outside hitter CJ Macias 
after Saturday night's game. 

Though there are many out- 
standing players this season, every 
player believes that he is not a single 
unit but instead an integral part of the 
whole. "We are not comprised of just 
a few key players; we are balanced." 
Macias said. "Colin [Lundeen] spreads 
the ball out so that everyone hits. Ev- 
eryone counts on everyone." 

The team's unity is apparent, 
their relationship as a whole tightly 
woven through their lives not only as 
teammates, but as friends too. Junior 
middle hitter Josh Stewart and his 
brother, freshman Corey Stewart, are 



r Colin Lundeen and junior 



Brock Ullrich. 

"We have a lot of good chem- 
istry; we all function well together as a 
unit, as well as being friends." Macias 

Senior Vitor Oliveira agrees 
that the team functions efficiently as a 
unit. "We are not about just one star 
player, but the whole group functions 

but the outsider hitters are playing well 
this year. The unity of the team is our 
greatest strength. We do everything 
together. We don't have troublemak- 
ers on the team. We are all cool with 
each other and I think that that sets us 
apart from other teams as well as past 

Though the Mastodons work 
as a team, there are several players 
whose performance is something to 
watch. According to assistant coach 
Ryan Perrolte, some of the players to 
keep tabs on are Colin Lundeen. setter: 
Ail-American CJ Macias as a power 
hitter; Josh Collins and Brock Ullrich 
as consistent passers. All are returning 
Mastodons, and according to Perrolte, 
"The core of our team has returned and 
that will help us a lot with our consis- 
tency and teamwork." The fact that so 
many arc returning also helps to deal 
with the road to the Final Four. 

With the graduation of only 
three of the team's players from last 
season, including Mike Daiga, Ser- 
dar Sikca and Michael Quinones. the 
'Dons seem to only be adding to their 
core of talented players. And with the 
returning muscle of seasoned players, 
the team seems to be set for a run for 
the Final Four. 

"We are such a close-knit 



Motivational Speaker, 
Entertainer Visits IPFW 



Comedian and motivational speak- 
er Judson Laipply visited IPFW's 
Walb Union Thursday, entertaining 
and educating students and faculty 
alike. A full-time speaker since 2002, 
Laipply tours the country in order to 
inspire people from all age groups and 
backgrounds through what he calls 
"comedy with content," offering a 
chance for people to take a break from 
their regular routines and enjoy being 
inspired. 

"I offer a temporary escape with 
the tools to help people permanently 
change their lives," said Laipply after 
Thursday's show. Not just a motiva- 
tional speaker, Laipply has a bache- 
lor's degree from Bluffton University 
and a master's degree from Bowling 
Green State University, along with 
an array of experiences ranging from 
certified aerobics instructor, poet, auc- 
tioneer to columnist. 

The speaker/comedian enlivened 
the audience at IPFW and also encour- 
aged them to step outside of their 
everyday routine and think about their 
lives, as well as their role within soci- 
ety as a whole. 

Laipply strives to keep his routines 
fresh and audience oriented, tailoring 
his messages for many diverse groups 
ranging from kindergarteners to cor- 
porate employees and every stop in 
between. 

Laipply believes that his messages 




provide a short-term escape from the 
every day routine, and in doing so, 
provides a given audience with the 
tools necessary to change their lives, if 
even in a simple way. 

According to Laipply, his show 
includes everyday inspirational mes- 
sages tucked neatly within memorable 
jokes and skits so that the audience 
may not only be entertained, but that 
they may also take more away from 
his show than just a few laughs and 
some dance moves. He believes that 
anyone could stand and give a speech 
or a lecture, but when it comes down 
to the heart of the issue, most people 
in the audience do not leave wilh much 
of the message. It is usually more 
memorable for the audience if they are 
left with a message within laughter and 
performance, which is where his dance 

Laipply performs a roughly su 
minute physical retelling of what he 
calls the "evolution of dance", which 
begins from 1095's style dance, through 
disco, grunge and popular music today. 
But if students missed the Thursday 
performance, they need not be upset; 
the video is available on www.you- 
tube.com. Laippley has also made 
appearances on morning news shows 
including The Today Show and Good 
Morning America, and is spreading his 
message throughout the country. 

"I have always been a big propo- 
nent of enjoying life, but also thinking 
about life and what you can do to make 
it better because the reality is we have

Though there is ;i high degree 
of talent with the reluming and new 
players, the remainder of the 2007 
season will not he an easy road to the 
Final Four or the National Chanipion- 



It is a true team effort," cites Coach 
Perrulle as the re son lor the success of 
the Mastodons' core team. 

Do not count the freshmen

Global warming: The world's

Al Gore, the truth and its inconvenience, is it too late?

hidden amongst these words.

something decent from a vending 
machine. 

Since the music building construc- 
ion i&gt; snll underway and many other 
lew plans are in the works for 1PFW, 
I beg of you one thine, please give us 
nore space for a lounge, and some 
&gt;ort of food avenue. Not only would 
it make an and theatre students hap- 
pier, but if you look at the proliiing 
aspect, you would make a ton of 
money off of us!

from a vendor if wc had one close

doesn't do a good job of providing 
vendors for students; we have count- 
less decent vending machines, Taco 
Bell in Walb, along with Subway, 
and Pizza Hut pizza by the slice in 
the basement of Kettler. 

The problem, once again, is that it

I know that the art building is prob-

a food vendor were somewhere near 
the art building, I'm sure most stu-

ments. We'd be too busy stuffing our 
faces with food to complain! 

The other recent thing that a lot of 
my fellow an majors have been dis- 
cussing j-, the size of our lounge. It is 
a very small room with two couches 
(actually, they're love seats), and two 
round tables. We have a chip and

wrong, when the 
most students are 
outside, like most of the campus. But 
let's be honest, from late August to 
the end of April, we only have about 
two months of nice weather. 

However, in times like right now, 
which is the middle of winter, we are 
forced inside to congregate between 
classes, and sometimes it is hard to 
find a place to sit and chat while eat- 
ing lunch (that's if I remembered it) 
without disturbing anyone else. 

With a larger lounge (and if wc 
had a food vendor) students would 
feel more comfonable to sit and relax 
and spend money on food. We would 
also feel more relaxed going back to 
our long studio classes, which would 
benelit the student and professors in 
tremendous ways, hence is the whole 
point of going to college anyway, 
right? 

So IPFW, I ask you, may we pret- 
ty please have a larger lounge and 
some son of food vendor? Pretty 
please with a cherry on top... We'll 
be on our best behavior too. 



Beckham-ing 
to America 

By Said El-Dajani 

Managing Editor 



If America were a television pro- 
gram, it would be a really great soap 
opera, a pomo with a plot, and 24 all 
in one. And if you're not ready, rat- 
ings are about to go up. Soccer, or as 
the rest of the world calls it, football, 
not to be confused with Canadian Ice 
hockey, is about to get recognized as 
a spon Americans can actually get 
into. Why? 

David Beckham, international soc- 
cer superstar, father of three, husband 
to Posh Spice, and an extremely sexy 
hair model, is coming to America. 
The last time this happened was when 
Eddie Murphy came to America, and 
of course he found a wife. So what 
the heck is David Beckham going to 
do in America? 

It could be the 250-million-dol- 
lar contract he's getting. Maybe it's 
his attraction to the overly abundant 
paparazzi that doesn't quite do it for 
him in Europe. Or maybe it's his jeal- 
ousy towards Daniel Radcliff, Harry 
Potter star, who happens to have a 
deeper voice than Beckham. 

Nonetheless, he's playing soccer 
for L.A. Galaxy, which should defi- 
nitely boost recordings on T1VO by 
women, potentially the economy, and 
solve world starvation... And by God, 
it's going to be bloody exciting.

Bad weather: no excuse for bad driving 



i: Terrible Drivi 



Tiff's Tiffs 

By Tiffany Dirig 

This week's victim: 

Last week, ifyoi 
had that morning of "bad" weather. 
I'll admit thai, when I stepped out 
of my apartment, I w,is almost sent 
sprawling. And, I did have to wait— 
wiih my defroster on high and wipers 
blazing — tor ins windshield to clear. 
tl refuse to scrape unless it's an ab- 
solute necessity. Ice-X was invented 
for people like me.) I will also tell 
you that, as I pulled out of my com- 
plex. I fishtailed onto the main road. 
That's about w tie re tii\ observation 
of this so-culled "inclement weather" 
ended. But, apparently, I was the 
only person thai shared in this. After 
my exciting entry to the roadways, I 
made the mental note that there will, 
undoubtedly, be black ice. 1 took this 
to mean "be cognizant." 

Oh, believe you me, I was very 
aware ot the dolts ... er, people ... with 
whom I was sharing the thorough- 
fares. You want to know how I knew 
this critical piece of information? It 
took me an hour to make what is usu- 
ally only a 20-minutc jaunt. One full 
hour of swearing, honking, yelling, 
and bending for the nicotine I so au- 
daciously gave up three weeks ago. 
Arc you asking yourself why it took 
me so long? Two words: bad driv- 

Here's 



Now. going that slowly is a haz- 
ard in and of itself, however the haz- 
ard is quadrupled when people are 
going that slowly and still uilgal- 
ing' Driving like that isn't gome to 
help when you have to slam (because 
none of the drivers I encountered 
remembered lo pump their brakes! 
on your brakes. In fuel, it's actually 
more dangerous. 

We live in Indiana. This is what I 
don't understand. Indiana is neither 
known tor Hs predictable weather nor

millisecond thai a snowtlake bits ihe

Now, if I drove (going 4l)mph.

by the way) past you thai irnialing 
Monday morning and you have never 
experienced ,m Indiana winter, then 
all is unquestionably torgiven - es- 
pecially if you hail from Florida or 
California or anywhere Southwest. 
That being said, the rest of us have 
lived here long enough to know what 
to expect. 

In fact, this has been the calm- 
est winter I've seen in years. For 
crying out loud, remember back in 
20! M when we got about 20 inches of 
snow in January alone? And, that's 
not even calculating in ice. hail, sleet,

Introducing expectation to preparation 



By Stephanie Samples 
chief Reporter 



Recently two friends of mine got 

engaged to each other. The engage- 
ment in itself was not a shock to me 
■is il was obvious it was coming. On 
the other hand, the engagement got 
me thinking. 

Am I really old enough to have 
married friends? 

When I have thought of marriage 
in the past, I never thought it would 
happen this early. I was asked to be a 
bridesmaid, which 1 am very thankful 
for, but I never thought that I would 
be getting sized for a bridesmaid 
dress and studying for finals at Ihe 
same time, which in a few months 
will be happening. 

While I am so happy for my friend, 
ihe&gt;c changes can be hard lo swallow. 
I don't know when I thought all of 
these changes would siart lo happen, 



but 1 don't think I thouglu it would 

It seems thai all changes come be- 
fore you are ready for them. A person 
spends 12 years in school and feels 



'. 



■. hut 



when it does you wonder where the 
lime went. Personally, when I gradu- 
ated from high school I was ready. 
bui couldn't believe how fast it had 

In college you think that the next 
fouryears are going to drag, and when 
they don't you wonder how prepared 
you are for what will happen next. I 
am in the second semester of my ju- 
nior year and cannot believe how last 
ihe past lew years have gone by. 
So the question I asked myself 



really e 



;ady? 



I don't think we are. I think that if 
a |KTson waited li nil I they were really 
ready with no fear for a new journey 



and myslery of it all thai make all ol 
the worries worth it'/ 

Unfortunately life is not a movie 
where the music chimes in and you 
know at that moment il is the righl 
tune lo make some sort of life-chang- 
ing decision. 

In real life we must find the music 
all on our own, and sadly sometimes 
we arc listening to Ihe wrong song, 
bui when we find the righl one we 
have to listen because if wc don't we 
may find ourselves forever wailing 
for someone to find it for us. 

Although there arc many ihings I 
know at this time ( am not ready for, 
I need to let go of when I think I will 
be ready and pay more attention to 
when I feel I am ready. 

Even though ihe thought of go- 
ing lo dinner with Inends and seeing 
them with diaper hags frightens me, 
it will happen sooner than I think, and 
most likely, like many oilier changes. 
when it happens it will be nothing 
like 1 expected. 



Saving Darfur needs to be top priority 



By Curtis J. Nash 



Not much has been reported in the 
national media these days about the 
incomprehensibly horrible situation 
in Darfur, with ihe headlines heing 
dominated by Iraq and David Beck- 
ham's 250-million-dollar contract to 
play for the LA Galaxy. 

It makes one wonder it anything 
is being done to prove that the world 
can learn from history and avoid p,i&gt;i 
lessons from inaction in Rwanda, 
Bosnia and the many other situations 
which did not prove it. 

The news of the day to day happen- 
ings in Darfur is not pleasant, light 
fare to accompany one's evening 
coffee to be sure, and it makes one 
wonder how can ihe media complain 
that we Americans care more about 
protecting oil-rich people when they 
don't send their reporters to cover 



Anyway, much political maneu- 
vering is going mi to address the situ- 
ation in Darfur, by the United Na- 
tions and our own government, and 
the question leads one to wonder if 
it will do any good. Will diplumaiic 
responses to the Darfurian ques- = 
tion slick? 

After all, a peace agreement 
was signed last May. However, at 
Ihe lime there were two or three 
rebel factions involved in the 
agreement, and after ihe much- 
heralded signing they split into = 
numerous factions which claim 
thai ihe\ did not agree to a truce. 

The President of Sudan did what 
he had to, according to him, and 
initialed a nation-wide cratkdown 
on them, and the result was that the 
murderous free-for-all went on with 
scarcely a break. 

At the onset of this year, the Presi- 
dent of Sudan agreed to accept a new 



peacekeeping torce, made Up of UN 
peacekeepers to aid the impotent 
African Union peacekeeping force 
whose numbers were woefully help- 
less, to watch over an area roughly 
the size of France. 

However, the whereabouts of 



'Like Bruce Spr ingseen sang, 

'One step up and two steps 

back.'" 



three UN peacekeepers that disap- 
peared last year are still unknown. 
Also, the original agreement for the 
larger UN force would have added 
about 30,000 peacekeepers to the Af- 
rican Union contingent, and the Su- 
danese government has since balked 
at allowing this many. 

Like Bruce Springsteen sang, 



"One step up and two steps 
Bill Richardson, the Gover 
New Mexico, has led 

attcmpi at addressing the situation. 

He was in Sudan last week, where he 

got the two sides to agree to a 60-day 

cease-fire. 

= However, when he left, the signers 
swore that they agreed to nothing. 
Still, Janjawecd patrols continue 
outside the IDP (Internally Dis- 
placed Persons) camps waiting 

or murder the men who leave the 
— camp to gather firewood. 

Still, Janjawecd horsemen ride 
into the villages to finish off what 
remains alter Sudanese Air Force 
strafing runs in what appears to be 
we 1 1 -coordinated attacks, although 
officially the government denies thai 



Ban Ki-moon, the new UN Sec- 
retary-General, has vowed to make 
Darfur the lop priority when he trav- 



els to Addis Abaha. lilhiopia, on Jan 
29 to address African issues. 

His special envoy on Darfur, Jan 
Eliasson. is in Khartoum (ihe capital 
of Sudan) as I write this. Will these 
diplomatic attempts to slop the geno- 
cide, which the world is compelled to 
do according to the Genocide Act of 
1948, accomplish this goal? 
According to Eliasson. a military 
' solution would be impossible. The 
President of The Sudan, when actu- 
ally agreeing to past agreements, has 
simply crossed his arms and waited 
for the fireworks to continue, know- 
ing that nothing would change since 
no one was forcing him to do any- 

Despile the fact that the situation 
in Darfur is covered only sporadi- 
cally in earnest, there are attempts to 
bring this to a peaceful conclusion. 

Whether or not any attempt to ac- 
complish this will stick or be ignored

Army of Anyone: The newest super-group isn't really very super at all

With a hyped up en-

Velvet Revolver took a clas

relevant in a non-relevant time due 
to their passionate and honest ap-

It is only natural then for me to 
have been excited about the newest 
super-group to rise from the ashes of 
former glory: Army of Anyone. Con- 
sisting of brothers Dean DcLco and 
Robert DeLeo from Stone Temple Pi-

a band playing the same music they

supernal uv.i I horrors within. 

With that, you are plopped 
into the game, and if you've 
played any Casllevania game* 

then you already know what 
you arc doing. You are run- 
ning around a castle viewing 
the action from the side in 
an old-school gaming *.ort of 
way. gaining power ups which 
allow access to new areas until 
your final confrontation. 

This approach has worked 
amazingly well forthe last four 
portable games, but finally it is 
starting to wear a bit thin, 

Don't get me wrong, the 
game is amazing. The graph- 
ics look wonderful (with a 
much more colorful and animc 
inspired look than before), the 
soundtrack is classic Caslleva- 
nia rock-golh-classical in a 
blender. The environments are 
rich and diverse, and the ac- 



tion is fast-paced and very fun. 
but we've played this before 
already. 

To its credit, the game 
does make use of a couple of 
new features. One is the dual 
character approach. You can 
switch between Jonathan and 
Charlotte on the fiy. Each char- 
acter has different abilities and 
weapons, so it is a different 
experience to control either 
and is necessary to treau all 
of the needed ground. You can 
also have both characters on 
screen at once (one computer 
controlled). This works sur- 
prisingly well, and is a fresh 
change. 

Older Catlevania games 
were very straight forward. 
You play a stage, finish it, and 
go on to the next very different 
stage. Later games have had 
various areas all inside of one 
interconnected castle. "Por- 
trait of Ruin" keeps the di- 
verse castle, but also has eight 
portals which lead to different 



plcted to finish the game. In 
a way, this game brings the 
different stages back to the 
franchise. 

Since it can be complet- 
ed in around seven hours 
(not including the bonus 
unlockabte modes), this one 
is perfect for quick 10-15 

to time. When you include 
those bonus modes (being 
able to replay the game us- 
ing different characters). 
there is replay value here. 

If you are a fan of the 
series, this game should be 
at the lop of your list. If you 



&gt; the ; 



. thiv 



game should be your in- 
troduction to it. But if you 
have grown bored with the 
last lew games in the scries, 
this one will not change 
your opinion. Remember 
Konami, diversity is your 
besl friend.

Out in Left Field 

By Sam Sprunger 



IPFW is not the only oil lege I h.it 
I've called home in my days as a 
coed. Before I became a Maslodon, 
I roamed a college lo our south in 
Muncie. During my time there I weni 
lo many basketball games with inure 
ihan NMHI people there at times. I was 
al a game thai had the mosl dr.un.ilie 
ends that I have ever witnessed. Our 
team had come from 12 behind, and 
the crowd was electric and loud. 
We hit a shot at Ihe buzzer to lake ihe 
game in lo overtime. Down by 



c end of OT, c 



■i hit a half 



game against our hated rival! 

The arena erupted, we were giv- 
iii!; high-lives to everyone, scream- 
ing and celebrating. The noise was 
deafening This brings me to Tuesday 
night when 1 covered IPFW playing 
Western Illinois- the learn that IPFW 
played a lew weeks back and won in 
five OT's and future Mid-Continent 
Conference rival The first encoun- 
ter was a great game, but ihis sec- 
ond lime was a pretty dam good one 



l! sll.hllmg 




Wcsicrnlllinoiscameo 
. seemed like ihcy couli 
Everything they put up seemed 
&gt;re points. They led by nine half 
ay through the first half. Thai's 
hen IPFW wenl on a run to get back 
even, then it was back-and-forth for 
the resi of the half that ended how 
else'' Tied This is how evenly these 
two teams arc lo each other: Seven 
of the nine periods that these teams 
have played this year (two halves and 



five overtime periods) have started 
with neither team ahead, and six of 
nine ended the same way. The second 
half started oui well with the 'Dons 
coming out and jumping ahead by 
eighl. Then Western Illinois pulled 
itself out of a slow shooting start lo 
the half, and got even. Close to the 
end of the game, I noticed something 
that I had only seen hack in .Muncie: 
A team alrnosl being willed to victory 
by the crowd. Willi jusi over a minute 
left Jaraun Burrows go! a lay-up to tie 
the game, and that's when it hit me. 

The arena blew up. There were 
aboul 1 100 people there and ii sound- 
ed like there were double that in Ihe 
stands. Then it snowballed, when 
Burrows (who had four fouls) blocked 
Xavier Price's shot with 32 seconds 
left, again it sounded like there were 
twice as many people. Then the cur- 
lain call of the night, when Burrows 
got the lay-up to go down with less 
than 2 seconds remaining, the place 
exploded. Il wasn't quite as loud it 
was lhai day back in Muncie, when 
we beat our rivals, but it was in the 
same area code. The Coliseum was 
loud and there's no two ways (o pul it. 
I caul imagine how loud it could've 
been if there had been 2000 people 
there, or 3000? There's some greal 
ba_skelball being played by the IPFW 
basketball teams. Last Saturday the 
women lost a nail-biter, at the end, 
but played great basketball. 

It was a very exciting game, but 
there were only 270 people there. We 
can get IPFW lo become a place that 
visiting learns hate to play. We need to 
come out to support them with num- 
bers. Even if we could fill the Gates 
Center halfway or more, for our Lady 
'Dons, teams coming in would feel 



pressure to keep the crowd out of the 
game, and force them to play tight. 
If we could get 3000 people at rest 
of our home games dive remaining I 
we could make a name for the Coli- 
seum, as a difficult place for visiting 
teams to win. Il may sound silly, but 
think of when we get into the Mid- 
Con we'll probably host the confer- 
ence tournament some years. If we 
can get a reputation of being tough to 
Ih-.i1 at home [hen a unite rente tour- 



nament championship wouldn't be to 
far off in the future. Imagine in the 
next few years, you could be sitting 
on a Thursday or Friday afternoon in 
March watching IPFW playing in the 
NCAA Tournament. It's all possible, 
but it doesn't just hinge on the teams, 
but the fans too. Well that's enough 
from me, let's get the attendance 
numbers up and cheer on our 'Dons! 
I'll talk to you later from out in left 
field.
