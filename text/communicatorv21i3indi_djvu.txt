Student Activities

participated in the event, half of 
the recognized organizations on

success for all organizations in 
volved and for the university. 

The student organizations on this 
campus fight a catch-22 situation. 
They need more members in order 
to have more events, but without 
events to draw attention to the 
clubs, people tend to forget that 
these organizations exist. Those 



ally gra

dividu.illy It was also an op- 
portunity for students to get to 
know what many campus clubs are 



they are still relevant, they need to 
be addressed and corrected. Too 
many students are content to ac- 

maior reason why' IPFW remains 
underdeveloped. 

Those students who took part in 
the organizational exposition des- 
erve a pat on the back for a job 
well done. Not only have they ex- 
panded their own organizations, but 
they have also shown the student 

only going to survive, but it is also 
going to thrive in the future. 

Those clubs which did not take 
part should organize and partici- 
pate next year. Students L

COMPUTING CONDUCT AND ETHICAL PRACTICES STATEMENT 

Computer users should understand and respect the ethical practices and requisite 
guidelines involving use of computing facilities at IPFW. Ethical practice suggests a user 
not only expects to have certain rights, but also is willing to take responsibility to ascertain 
that those rights are safeguarded by all. User rights include the right of privacy of data files 
and software applications and the right to an equitable share of computing resources. 
Along with user rights is the concomitant responsibility to respect the rights of others who 
are using the same resources. The ethical expectations accorded to the rights of authors 
and publishers extend to those utilizing computing and information resources. 

GUIDELINES 

Faculty and staff will be provided computing accounts to meet their employment needs. 
Student users will be assigned a specific account for class assignments. A corresponding 
user identification code will be assigned each user account. This code, including a 
password, is for the exclusive use of the owner. 

Legitimate use of IPFW computing systems include class assignments, instruction, 
research projects, and other related university work. The corresponding data should be 
used and revealed only within the bounds of access authorization. Accounts are not to be 
used for personal or unauthorized commercial or external purposes. Passwords are 
considered confidential and, as such, should not be used by others. It is expected that 
each user will employ appropriate system protection features and take precautions to 
ascertain that others do not obtain access to their computer resources, except in those 
e prior coordination and authorization has been initiated. 



ETHICAL PRACTICES

Obscene language materials or graphics are m

Users will not introduce or submit "virus" or other malicious software that destroys 
data, corrupts files and programs, or otherwise degrades computer operations. 

Knowledge of system administration and access codes without authority or permission 
does not justify modifying the computer systems, adjusting user profiles to gain extra 
resources, or degrading other users capabilities. Systems and network security failures are 
to be reported and not exploited to acquire additional resources or deprive others. 

SCOPE OF THIS DOCUMENT 

The purpose of this statement is to serve as a general reference document for users of 
IPFW computing facilities. It is not intended as a definitive statement of computing ethics 
nor will it serve as a complete compilation of guidelines for all computing situations. 
Willful disregard of the conduct and ethical principles applicable to the computing 
standards of the campus community will be dealt with through established university
