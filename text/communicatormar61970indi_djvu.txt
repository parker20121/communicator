^^u in a heap 
a' trouble, 

boy!" 

Joe xCiggins, who 
skyrocketed to fameCand 
possible fort\me)as the 
officious southern she- 
riff on the -Uodge auto- 
mobile commercials, will 
return to Fort Wgyne 
for two speaking en- 
gagements on the lU-PU 
Ft. Wayne Campus, Tues- 
day, March 10, at 11am, 
and 8 pm. 

In both of his lec- 
ture appearances he 
will discuss "Life in 
Television Land" and 
will answer questions 
submitted to him on 
cards by the student 
audience . 

The popular televi- 
sion personality, a na- 
tive of Logansport, is 
well-known to local 
audiences since he 
lived in Ft, Wayne for 
five years (1952-1956) 
during which he made 
numerous appe^ances 
on the stage of the Ft. 
Wayne Civic Playhouse 
and the Festival Music 
Theatre in Franke ■'•ark. 
Theatre-goers will 
provavly remember him 
best for his our stan- 
ding performances at 
the Civic as Uncle 
Louis in "The Happy 
Time," Detective Brody 
Xn "The Detective 



■'iO 



IJRDIJE 



' StoTj^f and as Falstaif 
in "Henry IV" or with 
the Festival as Mr. 
Lundie in "Brigadoon" 
and the title role of 
Finian McLonergan in 
"Finian's Raiii"bow," 

After a fling jt ho- 
tel management; at 
several outstanding 
Western hostelries, he 
landed in the mana- 
gerial spot at a ski 
lodge in Mammoth Lakes, 
Calif., where a chance 
meeting with a Holly- 
wood producer led him 
to the movie capital 
and his first success 
as Nils the blacksmith 
in the long -running 
relevision series "The 
Rifleman." 

However in 



PDeurcM \m^ \&lt;Mq 



of last year. 



October 
as the 



new car models were 
being revealed by the 
various automakers, Joe 
suddenly hit pay dirt 
with his depiction of 
the red-necked Southern 
sheriff who has a pen- 
chant for stopping 
people driving those 
Jazzy Dodge Challengers 
which look to him like 
race cars. 

His well-known salu- 
tation "You in a heap 
a' trouble, boy!" is a 
current byword. That 
first commercial led to 
such commotion among 
Dodge officials and 
their ad agency rep- 
resentatives that three 
additional commercials 
featuring the sheriff 
have been turned out 
and more are to come.

Confronting Pollution Problem 

le- The Problem 



There is np point in 
trying to describe the 
current pollution prob- 
lem in this brief space 
— even the April 
teach-in will only rake 
the metaphoric scum off 
the subject, so I'll 
Just offer a few hope- 
fully relevant observa- 
tions here* 

Interestingly, few 
try viewing pollution 
as what it really is— 
the most awesome accom- 
plishment mankind has 
yet collectively madeo. 
If you think abouJi it, 
there's a hell of a lot 
of air, water, and dirt 
on this planet, volxime- 
wise ,, aariCOBqp6Lredo to 
the total volume of 
people, vBdiiah is'nt 
even a lousy cubic 
mile». And yet with 
this relatively small 



iiiass,, we've managed to 
make the fresh water 
supplies in almost ev- 
BXi^ populous area unfit 
to drink without treat- 
ments And what used to 
be the freshest water 
supply— a colld motint- 
ain stream fed by melt- 
ing snow — is even pol- 
luteffi by Strontium-90 
fallout ,. with whichi we 
have polluted the far- 
thest reaches of the 
atmosphere, where ordi- 
nary pollutants caaa.'t 
reacho Even the seem*; 
ingly iintouchable o- 
ceans are dying: from 
DlEn and theiiiiBuL poliHu- 
tion» 

Man is now literally 
the master of his envi»- 
ronmento That fact may 
be of small comfort to 
some as they change the 
clogged filters of 
their gas masks before 
stepping through the 
air look that usedlto 
be their front door*

"2e The Movement 

Conservation has now 
acshievedi the status of 
a "mass movement" which: 
— trsaaslated from Or- 
well' s Newspee^— means 
that politiciansB now 
include it in their 
speeches and peopHe do 
cute but ineffectual 
things like b\iry auto- 
mobiles «. And of course 
President: Nixon has 
gotten om the so^box 
with everyone else, at- 
tempting; to use the is-^ 
SUB,, defusing attention 
from Vietnaar^ 

The "N^w Conserva- 
tionists"' are not yet 
organized; perhaps A^ 
priH 22 will see an imi- 
provement here* Bsit as 
of now the moat effect- 
ive conservation group 
is prcdDabl^ the SieErroa 
Club, which combines a 
strong arm-b ending:. Con- 
gressional lQ4)by with 
good local communicttfr: 
tions and influence » 
Shft Siierra Club is the 
major force in stopping 
such Army Corps of En- 
gineers projects as the 
EvengladeaK Airport*, in 
Florida e Hut the Sier»- 
raa Club is not highly 
highly involved 4n air 
pollutione 

Another point is 
that the issue of pol- 
lution is 'not a politi- 
cal one„ such as Viet- 
nam j and many political 
activists now becoming 
invoUsred with the issue 
are overlooking this* 
5, The Solttfcion 

I, was rather amused 
by a recent proposal of 
Governor Whitcomb for 
fighting pollution: 



establish a"modeB:"citi€ 
ies" type program, set- 
ting aside some city as 
an experimental area to 
use in developing anti- 
pollution msthodsc- This 
suggests that we don 'ft 
yet have the technology 
required to flight poli 
lutiom, and this just 
isn't the case, even 
though there is no harm 
in ftiiture research^ We 
do have effective meth- 
ods for cutting pollu- 
tion; the prohlem is 
lack of resources, and 
indirectly, incentives 
(read profits) o SeMB- 
one must pay the cost 
of cleaning up oyr en- 
vironment, and, ulti- 
mately, it will he the 
taxpayers 

people, either as con- 
sumers or as taxpayers o 
And if they elect not 
to pay the cost of 
cleaning ±-p the envi» 
ronment, then they will 
inevitably pay the 
greater cost? of Hiv- 
ing" on a dying world »
