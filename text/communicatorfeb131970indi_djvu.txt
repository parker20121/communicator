Bonnie Bunch Becomes 
Dream Girl Of 1970 



Bonnie Bunch, the Winter Car- 
nival Dream girl, floated into 
reality when she wos chosen the 
lU.PU Regional Campus Winier 
Carnival Queen. Sponsored by 
Alpha Epailon Kappa, Bonnie won 
by o large majority. "I was really 
Burprised, I didn't think I'd make 
it. I wag so scared," said Bonnie 
reflecting on the before-voting 

19-year-old Bonnie, a graduate 
of New Haven High School and 

at lU-PU Regional Campus is 
majoring in Special Education- 
She plans on working with re- 
tarded children after graduation. 
She is presently doing volunteer 
work at the Johnny Appleseed 
School- Her "fun" classes for this 
semester include; Geology, Human 
Geography, Human Development 
and -Learning, and Music Funda- 



mentals. In her rare spare lime 
Bonnie likea to read or listen lo 

Looking back on how she 
became involved with running for 
Queen she laughs. "I was silling 
in the cafeteria one day when 
someone came up and said 'Hey, 
1 heard you volunteered lo . . .' 
but somebody cut in saying 'Shhh, 
we haven't asked her yet.' This 
got me wondering, and a couple 
of days later some guys from the 
fraternity asked me if I'd like to 
run. I asked what I had to do and 
they soid there was nothing really 
except for having a feiv pictures 
taken. Bui later I found out 1 had 
to talk and do □ lot of other tilings 
and I got scared- But the contest 
was BO far along and I stuck with 
it. I'm glad I did run, anyway. 
Liko 1 said — it woe a lot of fun I" 



Theater Company 
To Present 
"Twelfth Night" 

■Twelfth Night," one of Wil- 
liam Shakespeare's most quoted 
comedies, willbe presented Feb- 
ruary 13 and 14 at 8:30 p.m. in 
Purdue Indiana Tlieatre, by the 
Indiana Theatre Company, Indi- 
ana University's widely acclaimed 
touring group. 

The company of graduate stu- 
dents is on a year-long tour which 
will take them to Connecticut and 
Delaware, as well as more local 
theatrical cities in the Midwest. 

The production will feature the 
entire company of traveling ac- 
tors. Profs. William E. Kinzer and 
Paul A. Norrenbrook of ihe I.U. 
speech and theatre faculty are 
director and designer, respective- 
ly. Costumes and lighting are by 
I'rofs. Leon I. Brauner and Ralph 
Rliodes, also of the speech and 
ihealre faculty. 

The incomparable Shakespeare 
is ivell represented in "Twelfth 
Night." His comedy, like his 
works of tragedy and history, is 
ever fresh and appealing and has 
the distinction of 400 years of 
virtually constant performance. 

Lighter than mony of The 
Bard's dramatizations, this work 
is noled as highly entertaining 
even to those who do not, as a 
rule, prefer the live theatre. The 
e.tacl delineations of character, 
the universal truths, and the pre- 
cision theatre is all tliere, but in 
nppealingly ivilly surroundings. 

"Twelfth Night," ivrole Henry 
Hazlilt, the great 19th century 
cvaluator, "may justly be consid- 
ered one of the most delightful of 
Shakespeare's comedies. It is full 
of sweetness and pleasantry." 

Most authorities place this ef- 
fective mingling of love, lyrical 
beauty, and rowdy laughter as the 
22nd in chronological order a- 
mong the 37 plays of Shakespeare. 
It was written, it is belived, in 
1600, between "Julius Cnesar" 
and "All's Well that End's Well."

made by calling 483.0922 begin- 
ning February 9. Tickets may be 
obtaUed at the PIT box office.

Hassinger and Schrock 
Join Magic 14 



Why in tlie world would any. 
body want to join Student Gov- 
ernmcat? WeU, here is the ans- 
wer given by Doug Schrock, a 
newly inducted member of Stu- 
dent Senate — "1 no longer de- 
cided to be an apathetic student 
on this campus." He feels that the 
whole organization of Student 
Government needs to be run more 
smoothly and efficiently; in ad- 
dition, students should have more 
say and the administration less. 
Mr. Shrock who is in llie School 
of Education viilh majors in Po- 



litical Science and Economics, 
continues his views on Student 
Government in his editorial on 
p. 2. 

Steve Hassinger, the second 
new senator joined the Student 
Senate "lo sec how things are 
run and to help in any possible 
way." Mr. Hassinger is especially 
concerned with the conslroined 
flow of communication between 
administration and Student Gov- 
ernment and hopes to somehow 
aid in solving t)ds problem as a 
Student Senator.

THE COMMUNICATOR 



Communicator Takes 
A Look At The Past 

EDITOR'S NOTE: Before second Bcmester began aitd while 
the staff was in a creative mood, loe decided to do a different 
kind of article. Since the new year had just slipped in — a 
look at the past seemed in order. Our super-snooper, Maru. 
has compiled the follmuing information from the Campus 
newspapers to give you a look at the past life of our Campus. 
Hope you enjoy it! 

by Mary EUzaheth Aksamit 

Claa9rooms, conference rooms, offices and recreational 
areas are arranged intelligently and with insight . . . The 
most attractive single facet of our new university is the 
completely modern library ... In brief, our new school is 
nearly perfect. It offers dreamed-of advantages to both 
students and professors. Now there is absolutely no excuse 
for below standard teaching or half-concerned learning. We 
have the opportunity and the facilities for learning; we need 
only take advantage of them. Student Exponent

Plans are now underway which will eventually enable 
students to earn a degree in Journalism. Initially the school

Such problems as trash-cluttered cafeteria tables . . .

Apathy — "Unfortunately, many of the people who play 
'Damn The Staff can be found trumping the tricks in the 
lounge and cafeteria." Student Exponent

The Student Assembly has done more than seems ap- 
parent. Now there is more red tape and things to be done 
than in the years to come. This may give the impression of 
inactivity, but the Assembly is anything but inactive . . . 
foresight means much to this group since the campus will 
probably be a four year college in the near future. The con- 
stitution needs to be flexible enough to meet the conditions 
of tomorrow as well as today. Student Exponent 

12-15-64 

In an intervieiv in the last issue of this newspaper 
(Student Exponent) the Assembly President stated that the 
Assembly doesn't have complete governing powers and he 
feels the Assembly should act in more than a mere social 
sense. If the last few meetings are any example of student 
government, we should all be happy the Assembly doesn't 
have complete governing powers. Perhaps even acting in a 
social sense is too much for them. Student Exponent

Lastly, let me say, that it is very evident that too many 
student activities are being run by the faculty. Part of the 
delay on voting is due to the faculty- This makes the stu- 
dents feel helpless to do anything. But the time has come 
for the Student Assembly to show that it can be effective 
without so much faculty supervision. Will the Assembly do it? 

For the sake of the future Student Government at 

the Regional Campus, I hope so. Merle R. Holden

Spoonful 



by Paul 
After several days of &gt;vatching, 
listening, and asking questions, 
I've begun to wonder if the stu- 
dents who sign the petition for 
the reinstatement of Professor Ho- 
rowitz realize exacdy what they 
have given their name lo. 

Let's put tlie issue of reinstate- 

amine the propaganda sheet dis- 
tribuied for the purpose of en- 
tightening of the goings-on of ihc 
administration. 

When a person, at least an edu- 
cated individual, forms an opin- 
ion about something he is ex- 
pected to have some basis of fact 
for his reasoning; something con- 
crete with which lo base up his 
statement. 

In die list of discrepancies put 
forth in the propaganda sheet, 
I've been unable lo find very 
much concrete fact. 

Point two discusses, or rather 
stales, ihat some person, whom 1 
guess must remain unidentified, 
knew about the dismissal of the 
professor concerned was informed. 
Then follows the "incriminating" 
advice that the person was the 
ivife of a local political figure, 
and also "violently" di so greed 
u'ith the professor's views. 

] have tried, but failed, to find 



Green- 
any proof showing this stotement 
to be essential in the adminbtra- 
tion's decision. But the attempted 
implication of the statement was 
obviously successful. 

The queslion here is, may we 
rightfully pass judgements from 
mere implications, or should wi 
demand more exacting informa 
tion in the form of facts? 

The third point brings up thi 
conversation held between Profes- 
sor Horowitz and Dean Johnson 
in the latler's office. 

It stales thai ihere were no uit- 
nesEcs to this particular conver- 
sation. Yet in the very next sen- 
tence, we arc given whai is sup- 
posedly the essence of thb con- 



It there were no witnesses, how 
can wc be sure what was said? 
Since there is no way to corra- 
borate .either individual's version 
of that conversation we have only 
hearsay, not hard fact. I suggest 
the committee, backing the peti' 
tion, come up with a few facts. 
This would be a great deal i 
helpful in aiding Professor Horo- 
witz. Abstractions can only bin'

Guest Editorial 

students, hark, pick up your long pink rabbit like ears, 
for your activity money is being handled by the wrong 
people. The student activity money is allocated by tlie Stu- 
dent Government, but is handled by the Administration. Of 
the $15.00 you pay in activities fee, $10.00 per student is 
allocated by the Student Government, the remaining $5.00 
is an athletic fee (especially for girls). As treasurer of the 
Student Government, I feel it is my duty and obligation to 
the students who paid this fee to tell them that everything 
that is paid must go through the administration and the 
money must come from Purdue's main administrative offices, 
where it is all sent on collection. This process takes time 
and money. If there were not so much red tape and delay 
involved approximately, §1,000 - §1,500 could be saved. 
Where this money comes from are the discounts one re- 
ceives for paying their bills right ai\"ay. Since the allocation 
for student activities amount to about 56,000 and normal 
discounts range from 2% to Z7o, this is where the 1,000 
to $1,500 dollars could be saved. Since the administration 
handles the money no one really KNOWS the financial 
situation. There is also the problem of organizations going 
into debt. Several organizations this year have gone into 
debt while others over-estimated expenditures and have 
money left. If the money was handled by the student gov- 
ernment, the Student Government would have a much better 
idea where your money goes, and you would have a better 
idea also. Another consideration must be made to the Athle- 
tic Budget. This $5.00 per student per semester is allocated 
by the student activities board which has no right to do so. 
The Students' Government should allocate the complete 
$15.00 and not just $10.00. If I were a girl I should complain 
about paying $10.00 a year for Athletic'a. 

Since the Student Government allocates your money, 
they should also handle the outflow of money. Students tend 
to watch money much closer than the administration. Sup- 
porting your Student Government is the beat way of sup- 
porting and taking an active interest in determining where 
and how much money is being spent. If the student gov- 
ernment does not get these powers, I propose to the students 
to not pay their activities fee next year. Doug Schrock

Letters 
to the editor 



Dear Editor, 

In a column which appeared in 
this newspaper several issues ago, 
I endorsed John Ainlay for Mid- 
Winler Carnival Queen. 1 did this 
with what I bad thought wos Mr, 
Ainlay's consent and to make a 
specific point. I feel that there 
arc certain virtues of feminity as 
opposed lo the conception of non- 
distinctive sexes. Karen Griggs, 
candidate of the Women's Liber- 
ation Front, was the antithesis of 
my point. While most of the other 
candidates would have been il- 
lustrative of my point of view, 
1 voted for Sharon Pine, ivho 1 
felt ivas most representative of the 
traditional concept of feminity. 

Mark Souder 

Student Body President 



Dear Editor: 

This letter is in regards to last 
weeks article in the Communicator 
by Vice-President John Ainlay. 
He told of the "recent atlempts 
by right wing, liberal, and pseudo- 
radical members of student gov- 
ernment lo conduct n campaign 
to elect me (John Ainlay) Mid- 
Winter Carnival Queen." 

I am in total agreement with 
him that "sandbox" tactics must 
be slopped or ihey will grow like 
a cancer. 

It is ihe responsibility of stu- 
denU, our constituents, to put an 
end lo this type of action. How- 
ever, I feel thai Mr. Ainlay made 
his remarks too encompassing 
when he staled, "... I call upon 
you lo esorcise your franchise ond 
unseat the entire lot in the up- 
coming cleclions." 

I, for one, did not participate 
in this "infantile activity" and I 
am sure that there were olhcrs 
like me. 

This letter is not just a political 
maneuver on my part, for I have 
no intention in running for re- 
election. I feel, however, that in 
this article Mr. Ainlay is alienat- 
ing the entire Sludent Government 
from ihc Sludent Body, and con- 
sequently, some innocent Senators 
and other Sludent Government 
members are being hurt.

Dear Editor, 

I would like to request a cor- 
rection in ihc editorial by Mr. 
Myers which appeared in the Feb- 
ruary 6 issue. 

The first sentence is incorrect. 
"lU-PU" does not hire or fire. 
Prof. Horowitz is on the staff of 
Indiana University and could only 
be dismissed by Indiana Univer- 
sity. Purdue University was not 
ulled nor involved.

Administration Defined 



_ Just what is "the administra- 
tion" and what is it's function at 
this school? Its amazing how few 
students actually know the answer 
to this very difficult ijucstion- This 
is what prompted me to reijucsi 
an interview with dean Donahue, 
the Assistant Dean of Academics. 

The first question that was 
asked was this: Whot is the basic 
role of the administration? He 
answered it in this way. 

"The major role of the admin- 
istration is to perform the frame- 
work for the function of the edu- 
cational process- To get the stu- 
dents into the school, to get them 
counseled, to get them enrolled, 
to get teachers hired, to get teach- 
uta paid, to collect fees; all of 



these lire o drain is tra live roles. 

When asked whether he thought 
two separate administrations were 
necessary at this campus, or could 
one central administration handle 
the schools affairs more efficient- 
ly, he gave this answer. 

"I would assume that the two 
administrations at this campus 
will grow into o closely associated 
central administrotion." When 
asked how near in the future this 
central administration may be, he 
said, "I suppose it might be a 
five to ten year period before we 
have a central administration at 
this campus." 

1 hope that this article will help 
the students to understand the 
administration and its roles-

leaching an introductory calculus 

The ingredients of the new vol- 
ume have been in preparation

The Purdue- Indian a Theatre „.. 
lounced the results of the Iryouts 
for its spring production, "Sh 
Stoops to Conquer," an eighleenlli 
century play written by" Johi. 
Sheridan. Michael Ferringo and 
Suzi Winans were named to the 
title roles of Mr. and Mrs. Hard- 
castle, Doug Opdycke as their im- 
pish stepson, and Mary Mawhorr 
as his uninterested fiancee. Filling 
out the central characters were 
Larry Wardlaw as Marlowe, Erin 
S. Halscma as Constance Meville, 
and Jeff Gibson as Hastings. 

Tlie play, a Restoration Period 
coiiiedy, was rather avontgarde 
then, but typical now-typical only 
in style. In the eighteenth century 
it was unconventional to produce 
a comedy primarily for laughs 
and not sentimentality, but Sher- 
idan threw away the book on this 
one. Hence, the "laughing come- 
dy" came into being and has 
remained ever since. 

The plot centers around the 
Hardcastle household and tlie 
humorous canivings of frustrated 
I. Tony Limpkin.l 



Frustrated because his foster par- 
ents deny him independence until 
he becomes of age (21), and idle 
simply because he has nothing in 
the world to do. To complicate 
his problems, he is betrothed to a 
girl he doesn't love and llkeivise, 
doesn't love him. It is only natural 
then, that such a troubled lad 
would want to release his tensions, 
especially with all thai lime on 
his hands. It doesn't take long for 
him to busy himself by manipulat- 
ing the lives and destinies of 
others to his fancy. The numerous 
ilications and commotions 
result from his "hobby" will 
keep any audience in stitches, 
whether it he eighteenth or twen- 
tieth century. 

The PIT cast, producers, and 

patronizers cordially invite all In- 

i-PurduB students and their 

guests to attend the showings on 

Friday and Saturday evenings, 

March 6, 7, 13, and 14, and also 

tlie Sunday matinees on March 8

rous evening tliat will laugh the 

idicnce into mild hysteria.

In Deep Planning 



On April 22 of this year ihere 
going to be a mass happening, 
is what has been termed "The 
April 22nd Environment Day." 
The purpose of ibis special is to 
put forth an educational effort to 
irouse public opinion. The region- 
il campus is planning a program 
which, hopefully, will serve as 
foeal point for the Pollution 
ich-In in the Northeast Indi-

Gottlieb, who is coordinating and 
ibilizing the activities at this 
campus, attempts arc being made 
to schedule persons such as Rep. 
E. Rdsb Adair, Edwaid Rou^, 



id Mayor Zeis. Dr. Gottlieb feels 
Ihat the Pollution Teach-in will 
show that the University ii serving 
northeastern Indiana. 

Many people are still not aware 
of the environmental problems 
being created by our advancing 
technology and expanding world 
population. Because of this the 
public is invited and encouraged.

of the University administrations 
and of interested citizens and 
groups in the community are im- 
portant goab to achieve in this
