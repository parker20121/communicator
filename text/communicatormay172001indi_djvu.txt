New classes to be offered fall 2001 



In February, ihe General Education 
Subcommiltee (GES| approved three new cours- 
es to be offered on campus in the near future. 

Those approved woe The Social History of 
Rock and Roll. Living Chemistry and Philosophy 
of Science. 

The Social Hislory of Bock and Roll. FOLK 
F254. was approved as a fulfillment for Area 111. 
TTic Individual. Culture and Socicly 

The three-credil-hour course will be offered 
for Ihe first ume in Ihe fall and is being taught by 
John Minton. associate professor of folklore in 
the depanmcnt of English and linguistics. 

The course will serve as a survey of rock 
and roll music and mil cover a broad overview of 
Its ongin and dcielopment. 

AcconJmg to Minion, students will sludy 
ihe dtffeienl stylet of rock and roll in various 
anistic. cultural and social con to is. This, he 
says, will cause sludenls "lo reflect more critical- 
ly and anal)-tically on ihe crucial role of an m 
culture and society generally." 

According lo Miolon, rock and roll music is 



Minton believes a course of thi^ nature will 
feed Sludenls' curiosity, as well as help them 
understand more about their own culture and 
somelhing that is part of iheir everyday lives 

FOLK (Folklorc/Eihnomusicology) F2S4 is 
pan of (he English and linguistics department. Il

Also approved by the GES was CUM 290. 
Living Chemisuy. Tlie official course number 
will eventually become CHM 104. It was 
approved as an Area II. Physical and Natural 
World, General Education course. 

Margarcl Kimble, insuuctor of chemistry, 
and Karen Encson. assistant professor of chem- 
isuy. were the co-crealors of ihe course. Each 
will be leaching seclions in the fall. The iwo 
worked together to create a course thai dicy 
ihoughi would saiisfy .sludenls' needs ai fPFW. 

According to Kimble, ihey approached both 
the biology and nursing departments to detennine 
their students' needs in chcmisny. 

Because they could not find a suitable ten- 
book for the course. Kimble and Encson may 
also be co-authon&lt;ig one m the future. Ericson

Opinions 



Letter to the editor 



I vii nitcd ind lived in Hungiry undo ihe commu- 
nlsl regime b«u.«n [949 ind 1986. On Sept. I. 1986. I 
came 10 Ihe United Slaicj wi[h my ramity ani wc became 
ciliicfu in 1996 Since 19E9. 1 hive been -..ortLini il IPFW 
u a fjculiy member. I never leiumed lo Ihat counliy. nol 
even (or 1 vuil. I refused lo go back *ilh my wife and our 
Iwo daughters lo sec our cluie relauvct. I have winred to 
put the pml behind me. Not everything from Ihe paiu but 
the politicaJ pressure and blackmail Ihat 1 and miny other 
Riillioru lur^ved Ihert I have lived m a dream ihal Ihit 
canrwl happen in this country. Thii changed when I read 
the tcllen of the sii republican tension who represent the 
nonhea.tt pan of Indiana. 

The way Ihey talk about academia and intellectuals 
brought back ihe bad memoncs. If 1 did not believe ihat 
Senalora Thomas Wyii. David Long. Charles and Robert 
Meeks. Harold Wheeler and David Ford do not speak any 
language other than English. I would think lhal the sixth 
paragraph or their letter was simply translated from a Icl- 
lef lhal mas published in the communist party-run media. 
The purpose there and here is similar Some politicians 
want lo portray a group of people as enemies of ordinary 
people. Thai has been a standard method in alt dictalor- 
shipi. If this happened in Cuba or China, these senators 
would be outraged and they would criliciu ihe rulers of 
these countries. Bui ncvcuhctcss, they try to use the same 
method hcie Tar their own purposes. 

To stand up for "academic frcedum." or any kind of 
freedom, it not cowardly or hypocritical. It takes a lot of 
courage! I remember, and 1 can imagine, how scary it was 
and can be to stand up far free speech against the pouer of 
&gt;ii members of the central commillee of Ihe stale pany 
(communist) or the sii powerful senators of one of the 
state parlies (Republican). 

The teller is a clear attack on the freedom of religion 
OS well. Si&gt; while men want to lell lo the letl of the world 
whal Christianily is, Jesus con mean different things for 
different people. Fot example, there is nothing blasphe- 
mous If a young African- American kid or adull piciuie 
JesiLs i\ a black man. [ am not guy, but I am not homo- 
phobic cilhcr. I did nol read ihc play and 1 did nol want to 



Accordingto tome who read the play, none of the sii sen- 
ators read ii. But even if the play docs what they ctaim. 
ihey are still wrcing to deny ihe right of gay people to feci 
Jesus close to them. Again, if a timilor ihmg happened in 
other countries, they would protest ii. Bui they nevenhe- 
leu do it here 

ChorKcllor Wanetl happens ro be Jewish and some of 
his family members are Christian. The personal attack 
against him. by slating ihil he would be more sensitive if 
"the vicums were members of such religious minorities as

maybe anti-Semitic, it is completely false. I know he tujy 
ports his family's beliefs. 

Since I learned English when I was an adult ai about 
Ihe age of 42. it is nol good enough lo lecture anybody on 
ihc meaning of wonts. But I know at least as much that 
equity funding is given when some iiuttiution is behind 
other similar institutions IPFW is behind most of the other 
inslituliOTU in Indiana because our representatives have nol 
represented the interest of the region well enough. This is 
not only IPFW. Tlie northeast pan of Indiana loses taxpay- 
ers' money to Ihe other parts. This is panly the fault of our 
eteclcd repicscntaUve. including the si&gt; senators. So Ui 
mention Ihis in the leller is not only unfair, bul it is politi- 

Whal mokes me angry is that 1 did not plan to go to 
sec Ihe play and spend my money on it. Bui after the let- 
ters of the six senators, I do nol have any other option left. 
There is nothing more important in life than lo support 
freedom: freedom of speech, academic freedom and free- 
dom of religion. This is whal ihe Constiluiion of the Uniled 
States guarantees I thought ihal iheic sit tenolon swotc lo 
uphold and not attack il. Shame on you. comrades.

Freedom for all or freedom for none— freedom for some will not work 



■i nshl « 



In the article. "'Corpus Christi': It's even 
worse than you know," {published in The News- 
Senlincl Sunday. May S) Kevin Lcininger. the 
author, stales that we can and must stand up for 
our failh and make it known when Scripture is 
iwltlcd 10 make a conltadicloiy political or social 
point. This column is an effort lo do just lhal. 

My love far freedom is second only lo my 
love for Jesus Chriil. As a devout Chrislian. I am 
not offended by people who misunderstand or 
misrepresent CKrisl; 1 see such expressions as my 
chance lo share my own understanding of and 
experiences wiih Him. Events such as ■'Corpus 
Christi" open up these opportunities. Il is nol the 
point of this article lo endorse homosexuality or 
its expression, bul lo argue for more speech as the 
answer lo "bad" speech, theology or on. 

In Ihe ntsi half of Lriningcr's article, il is 
implied lhal the play justifies sin by inclusion of 
Ihe verse from Genesis thai "...Gtid saw every- 
thing He made, and il was very good." The prob- 
lem, il IS slated. Is thai this "...passage comes 
before sin entered the world." 

My response is that we were created with 
free will. Fnlcdom is of God — If He didn't want 
us ID be free. He would have created us without 
the ability lo choose evil or good. God wanted a 
good and perfect love for Him. Without freedom, 
our choice to love would be virtually meaningless 
because we would have no alhcr option. 

The importance and significance of living as 
Chrisiians. then, is conlextiuliud within the tact 
that wc don't have lo love Christ or anyone else. 
Wc choose lo believe in Him — just as others 
choose 10 believe in Mohammed. Buddha or 



I oughl lo be stopped. Christians by 
arc obligated to silence. In the United 
arc granted freedom OE^ — nol freedom

call ihemselves Christians and use their religion 
10 stifle the voices of non -Christians promolc the 
same thinking lhal ihrealens religious freedoms 
more generally. 

It seems Ihat the biggest argument againsi 
"Corpus Christi" is that it is offensive lo 
Christians If we act on the belief that offensive 






challenge for which Chri 
specifically been called. As believers, we are lo be 
Christ-like, and Christ said Ihe greatest of all 
commandments is lo love one another. Doing this. 
He said, would fulfill all the others. Publicly con- 
demning certain members of our society is nol ihc 
least bit loving; il is judgmental. Being judgmen* 
lal is one of ihe most widespiead and valid criti- 
cisms that others hold of Christians. It is the job 
of the Holy Spini lo work in and through people. 



and we do not need lo be the Holy Spirit for 
someone else He is perfecily capable of doing 
His own work. When we slcp outside love and 
inlo the active humiliation of those who do not 
believe in Jesus Christ, we essentially are con- 
tributing lo the defamation of His name. 

As a Chrislian. I am concerned about 
"Corpus Christi" not just because of its content or 
producers bul more so because of Ihe way that 
people who call themselves Christians arc han- 

Didn't Jesus sit at Ihe table with sinners? He 
was cnlicized by the Pharisees for speaking and 
caling wilh drunks and proslilules. bul His answer 
was that He was a physician Who'd come for 
those who needed healing. 

If we are truly concerned about the effects 
this show will or will not have on the spiritual 
health of our community, we oughl lo act like 
Jesus and spend lime with those who ore closest 
lo its production. We ought lo gel lo know them 
and love Ihcm as human beings. People are not 
changed by high-browed IooJls, nagging fingers 
in their faces or Bibles thumped over their heads, 
tl IS God's goodness lhal calls us lo repentance. 

My own lepeniance and subsequent salva- 
tion came afler ihc ongoing, conlinuous interven- 
tion of another who loved and cared for me, 
despite my sins. In ihc end, wc all have sinned 
and come short of the gloiy of God. 

I will in fact pray for "these people," as 
Lcininger suggested, right after I finish praying 
for him. myself and other Christians. My prayer 
will be for mercy, that we might be able lo con- 
tinue producing our own plays, meeting and pray- 
ing ai IPFW and publishing opinions such as 
these — despite Leininger's and olhcrs' efforts lo 
further the bounds of censorship. 



Life at IPFW: Things that often go right 

h,. u„ui c^iiu_ along those agenda lines that this editorial is shares classes, and he is able lo analyse tcehnolo- one of ihe ««ira n™,,: ,&gt;,„ui.i, ,„ „„^.-,. 



Il IS wilh humor and humilily thai I look 
back on my experiences ihis semester at IPFW. As 
managing editor of The Communicator, il has 
been my privilege lo collect and compile the con- 
lenls of pages two and three of the newspaper. 

It is an honor to have worked with a talent- 
ed group of individuals who weekly contributed 
to these and other pages, and who constructively 
collaborated on certain issues. 

Recently, we wen: informed that funding for 
this publication may be significantly ineieased. 
News such as this, that various educational efTorls 
and creative endeavors are actively supported by 
Sludenl Govemmcnl and Ihe fldminislfation of 
IPFW, has become a palletn. 

While we undoubtedly have questions, 
problems, concerns and issues about the events 
ai)d i^ponu nines which exisl on this campus, 
there arc countless other successes worthy of 
news space. When something goes wrong. Oicre's 
no doubt 11 will be spoken about ai the least and 
likely will be reported in the newspaper, 

Il is far less likely, however, that we report 
good news just for the sake of reporting iL 
Something in human nature indicates that we fail 
to fully oppreciaie the goodness in everyday 
activities and events; only when somediing goes 
wrong or happens unexpectedly, do we lalize 
how good we had il So. il is m this spuit and 



Whal I appreciate most about IPFW is the 
support of its students by faculty and the adminis- 
tration. Chancellor Michael WanelJ has been 
under fire lately from stale senators and other 
lawmakers lo concede to their censorial demands 
on pioduciion of "Corpus Christi." True lo ihe 
spirit of academic freedom and personal cxpics- 
sian, Wanell stands beside Larry Life and his 
group's right 10 follow through on the production. 

Information and Technology Services' con- 
sistent, ongoing and careful attention to the over- 
all functioning of technology on ihis campus con- 
tributes daily to students' education and success. 
As with other departments, hum time to time 
problems have come up. bul die leadership of fTS 
is quick to acknowledge and address the issues 
openly and in a fonhnghl fashion. For ihis, if 
nolhing else, they are deserving of our thanks and 
applause. 

Certain siudcnt assistants are especially 
helpful and give a good impression of die depart- 
ment: Jim Pingle. who works at rrS' front desk in 
Ketder Hall. Not only is Pingle quick and helpful 
on computer inquiries, his professionalism carries 
through in the classroom as well. He expresses 
himself widi confidence, bul remains open lo and 
respectful of new ideas. Pingle is a son of unan- 
nounced leader among his peers: this reinforces 
his and rrS' character and credibility more gener- 



classes. and he is able lo analyie technolo- 
gy concerns for the efticienl and effeclive resolu- 
tion of problems. Although somewhat quiet. 
Osbom's actions say all dial is necessary for 
understanding what it means lo be a team player. 
Bret Fraizer, who works in the Walb computer 
lab. goes out of his way lo help students and 
shows true concern for whal happens on campus. 
Frailer is polite, responsive and able lo irou- 
bleshool mosl students' concerns. Chatacleristics 
common lo all three of diese genUemcn are a 
remarkable understanding of computers and soft- 
ware, respecl and concern for oihers and an evi- 
dent commitment lo being team players. 

Police officers on diis campus define what il 
means lo "serve and protect." As a student, I feel 
safe here, and having come from another univer- 
sity, you can't put a price on this feeling. The 
police are not only helpful and responsive to safe- 
ly concerns, bul are also proactive about safety. 
Rape Awareness and Defense classes, for exam- 
ple, leach women how to defend diemselves and 
are offered free to IPFW students. The police give 
students escorts to their cars when requesled and 
help those with keys locked in their cars or whose

On a personal note, die readers of The 
Communicator make my day. Those of you who 
have offered your suggestions, constructive criti- 
cisms, advice and counsel have helped this paper 
tremendously Some of our greatest improve- 
ments have come at the iuggestion of others. And. 
as I said in an editorial column at the beginning of 
this semester. I'd rather have ten letters of outrage 
about an article (or the omission of an article) 
dian no response at all. For those who've aantacl- 
ed us about errors, misprints, complaints or con- 
cerns, your input is valued. While there may or 
may not have been immediate or noticeable 
action, never doubt thai your thoughts were con- 
sidered and taken seriously. We ihank you for 
contacting us and ask that you would continue to 
do so in Ihe future. 

Yes. IPFW does indeed have ils problems, as 
does any university, corporation or family. But for 
all of our trials, there are so many more tri- 
umphs.. .this is our tribute id you Thanks lo 
everyone for being a pan of this great place of 
learning.

"They told mc my work was good, but 
ihcy'dneverheardof mebefoie. They lold me to

FeiFTcr said he noticed a specific newspaper, 
the Village Voice, In each magazine editor's

The worst thing that could

there's a right way to do 
something and you Hmit 
yourself to that way. Doing 
it wrong and getting used

Feiffer agreed and 
began drawing cartoons 
baud on his own experi- 
ences in ihc dating world. 

He lived in Greenwich 
Village at the time and could 
not find cartoons "that relat- 
ed to my hormones-to the 
beautiful 



revivoJ me." he ijid. "li was a lemfic ihing that 
in the beginning looked dUiOroiu.'* 

Feiffcr's revival began through graphic 
daign and animation. He created an animation. 
"Munro." about a four- year-old who joins the 

"Munro" won an Academy Award in 1961. 
Feiffer followed up the award by wnling plays. 

Feiffer wrote a play called "Utile Murders." 
but the play was not well-received on Broadway. 
"This rcponcr I knew called mc up and said. 
'Okay. Mr. Bigshoi Cartoonist, you've wniien a 
play and it lloppcd. Now whal are you going to 
do''" 

FeilTer responded. "I'm going 10 keep bnng- 
ing il back until you schmuck^ get il nght." 

Two yeara later, in 1969, the play wnn the 
Obic Award and the Outer Critics Circle Award 
off- Broadway. 

"The worst thing that could happen is to 
assume that there's a right way to do something 
and you limit yourwlf to thai way." Feiffer said.

The Village \toice was now paying Feiffer 
for his canooni. however, he left the Wjice when 
Ihc paper wanted to continue publishing his comic 
strip without paying him. 

Feiffer now had to reinvent himself. "Il 



aged with failure. "Doing it wrong and get- 
ting used 10 doing 11 wrong is just part of the 
pnxtis," he said. "Do with your gifts whai you 
can and apply ihcm." 

Feiitcr eventually branched out to write 
screenplays. The lilm "Carnal Knowledge" tea- 
luring Jack Nicholson, was one of Fciffcr's cre- 
ations as well as 1980's "Popeye" starring Robin 
Willmms. 

"Carnal Knowledge" was Feiffer's first 
screenplay. "I didn't know what 1 was doing." he 
said, FeifTcr acquired a copy of a different screen- 
play for reference, bui was confused by the stage 



biage on pieces ol 
paper and random- 



play. The plan 
worked. "Directors 
don't pay attention 
to [the stage direc- 
tion vernacular] 
anyway." he said. 



Feiffer cur- 
rently writes children's books His book "Bark, 
George" wa.s a number one-best seller on 
Amazon com. 

Feiffer warned. "A dilTaencccjiits between 
eipressing one's ego and telling a story " Feiffer 
said children can tell when an illustmtor draws 10 
show off his illustration ability versus to letl a 
story. "Children examine pictures much closer

Feiffer is currently writing another chil- 
dren's book about a boy who gets left at the side 
of Ihc itjad by his parents. The book is scheduled 
to be released next fall. 



Staind's 'Break the Cycle': 
a must-have for rock fans 



Thousands of fans were irealcd lo an almost 
magical performance in the summer of 1999 
when Aaron Lewis, lead singer of Staind. and 
Limp Bitkil's Fred Durst played the song 
'Outside' at a Family Values Tour show. 

The song featured a sweating and tormented 
Lewis singing his hean out. He was accompanied 
only by his acoustic guitar and Dursl's sparse 
backing vocals. 

"Outside* was buried at the very end of the 
1999 Family Values Tour album. Nearly forgotten 
tmUl this past spring, it began receiving heavy 
rotation on MTV and rock radio stations. Lately, 
ilFiof become a number one sensation. Just in time 
for the release of Siaind'sthiid album, 'Break The 



, popular hard rock bands, the group is 
able to stand out and keep an clement of freshness 
and originality to their sound. 

[t could be guitarist Mushok's clean guiur 
sound, \Vhen he isn't stomping on his distonion 
pedal to gel those really huge, but rather unorigi- 
nal guitar riffs and tones, he's able to put out this 
very tasty clean sound. His clean tone is sad and 
emphalic-almost perfectly accompanying Lewis's 
sad. sad vocals. 

Yet somehow Mushok's clean lones still 
sound OS huge as his disloned lanes. Nothing is 
lost in the transition between soft and angry-the 
guitar work is still massive and heavy, be it clean 
or distorted. 

Overall. "Break the Cycle" is a must-have 
far the hard rock enthusiast. Suind fans should 



Cycle.'

w album features a unique studio vcr- 

af 'Outside." The new version features the 
whole band, which is a pleasant change from the 
sparse live version. Losing none of its sincerity 
and passion, the studio 'Outside' is turned into a 
pounding rock tunc with a disloned chorus and 
lots of guitar embellishments and Fills. 

The other 12 songs of "Break (he Cycle" are 
classic Siaind songs. Track number four is occu- 
pied by Staind's tounh radio hit. 'It's Been 
Awhile.' The song blends, in grunge-like fashion, 
soft verses and loud choruses. 

Deviating from grunge, however, is Staind's 
UK ofhcBvily detuned guitarE. Staind by farisun- 
unique in this aspect. Many popular bands like 
Kom and Limp B'ukii have also made ample use 
of detuned guitars. (Not to gel too technii 
but detuning guitars is a very old tcchniqi 
nating even before the early days of "'

A year ago a( ihis time, there 
were two ciliu wiih ihc population of 
Fori Wayne which did not have an 
NCAA Division I program: Fort

When IPFW began to ihink about 
making itie switch from NCAA 
Division II to Division I. Ihcy knew 
ihcy needed a strong man al ihc helm

The choice of Walt Bowman as 
athletic direc(or was a superb choice. 
DcfulG coming (o IPFW. Bowman was 
at Gordon College, located on Ihe 
nonh shore, just outside Boslon. At (he 
lime, Bowman had eiperience in 
NAIA, DI, DII and Dill schools. 

Bowman ipoke of hi 
for Ihe switch to Dl. 'For

Gelling into a conference is the 
neit big (ask (or Bowman, as IPFW 
looks suongly to the Mid-Conlineni 
Conference for membership. With five 
of their eight schools about two hours 
away, it seems a great fit. 'For ui. we
