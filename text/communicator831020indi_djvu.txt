Perspectives 

Road work unique 



With an enrollment of 10,476 students, 
facilities including six major buildings 
and a curriculum offeringovcr 96 degree 
programs, IPFW is the sixth largest 
university in Indiana. 

Even though this campus has reached 
3 large sire, it has the potential to grow 
even more, which is what IPFW officials 
should be thinking about. And they are. 

Monday, the Fort Wayne (Faculty) 
'•enate made a wise move when it passed 
a resolution supporting the development 
of an academic master plan which would 
bo implemented by a physical master 
plan. This means decisions regarding 
what academic programs lo add will be 
made before deciding whal buildings to 
construct and where to construct them. 

The resolution proposed by Michael C. 
Downs, chair of the deparlmeni of 
political science, slates the instructional 



faculty must have substantial 
representation among groups who will 
carry out the academic and physical 
master plans. The resolution also states 
recommendations of the plans should be 
reviewed by the Fort Wayne Senate 

The Senate realized construction of 
buildings would be unwise if no 
academic programs are planned first. 
Why wasle money on buildings if no one 
knows whal will go inside? 

The faculty should make sure it gets 
representation when the academic and 
physical master plans are carried oul. 

Decisions regarding the direction of an 
education should be made by those who 
carry it out — the faculty. 

Chancellor Joseph P Giusti hit the 
nail on the head when he said, "The 
Faculty sets the educational direction of 
this campus "
