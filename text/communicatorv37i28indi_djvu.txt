At least 31 students win.- killed on 
the Virginia Tech campus in Black- 
ford, VA Monday when an unknown 
shooter opened fire in a massacre 
some are now dubbing "The College 
Columbine." 

At 7:15 a.m. two people were shot 
.mil killed in Aiiihk-r Johnson Dormi- 
tory, and two hours later, at least 29 
including the shooter were gunned 
down in Norris Hall, on the opposite 
side ol campus Thirteen .ire still re- 
portedly hospitalized. 

It has been speculated that in ad- 
dition to the gunshot injuries, other 
students or laculiy summed injuries 



as a result of jumping out ol Norris 
Hall's second-story windows. 

Police are still trying to positively 
identify the victims as well as the 
shooter in what is being called a 
"gruesome" and "terrible tragedy." 
Bodies are reportedly scattered 
throughout Norris Hall, the scene of 
the majority of the murders. 

There is much speculation regard 
ing why students were not notified in 
the two hours between the first and 
second shootings, 

"There has been B great outpour- 
ing ol support, bui we ask dial people 
continue to pray.' said Virginia attor- 
ney general Bob McDonnell. 

The massacre conies on the heels 
of at least two bomb threats to the 
School of Science and Hngmecnng. 
and whether liierc is a connection be- 
: threats and the shootings. 



Investigators are also questioning 
whether the two shooting incidents 
are connected, citing thai the first 
-hooiuii] appeared to be "domestic in 
nature" and thai the authorities had 
reason to believe thai "the shooter 
had left campus and possihly the 
state," said Wendell Flinchum, Vir- 
ginia Tech police chief. 

The first incident occurred at 7:15 
a.m. in Ambler Johnson Hull, a dumi 
that houses 895 students, and two 
hours later, more shots rant out. this 
time in Norris Hall. 

"The first thing I saw was the police 
taking their guns out. Then I knew 
this was serious," said Jamal Albarg- 
houti, a student who videotaped 27 
gunshots on his cell phone camera. 

The still unidentified shooter is 
believed to have taken his own life, 
but had been spoiled wearing a hul- 



lcl|irool |.i, kcd. tiling eilliei a semi 
automatic or automatic weapon, 

According to McDonnell, "At this 
point there are more questions than 
answers. Local and state police urc 
on the scene with all the resources 
we've got," 

There is much speculation regard- 
ing why students were not notified in 
the tWO hours between the first and 
second shootings. 

Authorities say that in Q tragedy 









relye 



nesses and good Samaritans. The 
second and "most deadly shooting 
in U.S. history" was unexpected be- 
cause, according to Chief Flinchum,

Local, national treasure 
Vonnegut dies at 84 

By Ben Garman „, , ., 

1 States, Vonnegut attempted to sup- 

port a family and cope with the hor- 
rific experience of fighting in World 
War II. After several unsuccessful at- 
tempts al a regular career, he decided 
to write full time. He later published 
books such as Player Piano, The Si- 
rens of Titan, Cat's Cradle and God 
Bless You, Mr. Roscwatcr. 

It was this masterpiece. Slaughter- 
house-:! that senl him to the forefront 
of American fiction. He went on to 
write many oilier acclaimed works 
such as Breakfast ol Champions. Jail- 
bird. Slapstick, and most recently A 
Man Without a Country. 

This past week, Kurt Vonnegut Jr 
died in his New York apartment. 
Oddly enough, it did not come from 
any complications of his habilual 
smoking or drinking, but i risk ad from 
brain injuries suffered from a fall. 

And thus, one of the great minds 
in our time was laid to rest. Our loss 
exceeds all words and the debt that is 
owed Mr. Vonnegut is substantial. 

How does one repay an artist for 
Ins invaluable contributions'.' Perhaps 
it is to give him tits final say So. Kun 
Vonnegut, ynu asked for it . . . 

If I should ever die. God forbid, 

let this be my epitaph: 

THE ONLY PROOF HE NEED- 



psm 



On February 13, 1945, an estimat- 
ed 135,000 people died in Dresden. 
Germany by the Allied Forces' fire- 
bomhings Dresden was not a mili- 
tary stronghold by any stretch of the 
imagination, hut was instead a city 
housing many refugees that were 
ileeing from the Russian army and 
many Allied POWs. 

Not only were there an incredible 
number of people* (mostly civilian) 

a Mecca for European Culture and 
Arts. Amidst this destruction of Art 
and human life, one artist happened 
to survive this slaughter. 

On November 1 1 . 1922, Kurt Von- 
negut Jr. was bom in Indianapolis In- 
After graduating from college, 
Vonnegut enlisted in the United 
Stales Army in 1943 and was trained 
as a mechanical engineer. 

During the Battle of the Bulge, 
Vonnegut was then taken to Dresden 

This is where Vonnegut's story 
could easily have ended, as just one 
of the many casualties of the attack 
on Dresden. Fortunately, he man- 
aged to survive the bombings in a 
meal packing plant with a few other 
POWs. Like the legendary Phoenix 
bird, art, culture and life were reborn 
from the ashes.

Office bends over backwards to fa- 
eilitalc and help graduates celebrate 
their achievements " The office does 
its best to ensure that late applicant- 
names appear in the program and tin 
degrees are available al Commence- 
ment. However, there is only so 
much the office can do, and w 
student may be able to walk during

Should we question stupidity today? 



By Nicki Daly 



How is it that people get dumber 
and dumber all the time? It seems 
as though lately my face has been 
plastered with that "Are you kidding 
me?" look. (And no, they're not.) 
Sometimes I skim through the advice 
columns in the local paper just to see 
what problems are currently plagu- 
ing today's society. 

Last week, some girl wrote in to 
say that she was newly and happily 
married, with only one problem - 
that they met in a rundown bathroom 



fills , 






whenever people ask where 
met, people laugh. Of course thi 
it's funny! Either get a sense i 
mororjust tell people that you i

during the day nine. Ahby responded 
that Ihey were probably tired. Good 
job, ladies. I'd say that you should 
pal yourselves on the back, hut really 
you need to ship yourself across the 
face tor hemg so incredibly dumb. 

And why are there so many talk 
shows out there'.' People jusl love 
talking to other people about their 
problems. I would gamble that Tyra 
Banks is not going to answer any 
questions for you thai you couldn't 
have figured out yourself. 

I'm probably not the best person 
to complain about this, since I gen- 
erally write my articles about people 
that annoy me But I'm pot asking tor 
help, I just want Io put it out there. I 
sleep a hole easier ai nighi knowing 
that maybe a couple people have read 
my column and will realize exactly 
how annoying they are and may lone 
it down a bit. 

The more 1 think about all ol this. 



I realize that I should have majored 
in psychology. Willi the rale at winch 
people arc increasing in extreme stu- 
pidity, I'm sure thai there arc plenty 
ol jobs open oul there. 

You don'l even really need a de- 
gree, jusl confidence. Look at Dr. 
Phil no degree just that confident

lhat an overweight man would hit il

'Rocky Balboa' is still the champ 

Stallone sends the beloved movie icon out with dignity 



By Mike Webb 

Arts &amp; Entertainment Editor 



As a child in the 80s, 1 had 2 
goals in life: To be Rambo. and to 
he Rocky Just how I was going to 
accomplish this I was never quite 
sure, but it just seemed like il need- 
ed to happen. 

To say that I was a fan of Syl- 
vester Stallone movies would be 

he made contained the elements 
that a little boy like me would look 
al as awesome. And everywhere he 
wem, things exploded! 

That is why 1 was worried 
when it was announced that Stal- 
lone would be revisiting the char- 
acter of Rocky in "Rocky Balboa." 
I was pretty sure it would destroy 
the eliildhoml magic ihat I've been 
carrying around for 20 years. 

After all, Stallone is 60 years 
old! Is it realistic to make a movie 
iibout a 60-year-old professional 
bo\cr? Luckily, that isn't really 
what the movie is about, and after 
watching n on DVD, my child- 
hood magic is more intact than it 
was before. 

The story picks up with Rocky 
living alone m Smith Ph illy. Adrian 
is dead and Rocky is dealing with 
being a widow and aging alone. 
His son has a successful business 
job and has little time or desire to 
be around his lather who has always 
east a larger than hie shadow. Rocky 
spends niosi of his time visiting the 
cemetery and humoring guests in his 




h.uilc between the 2 boxers is ar- 
ranged as an exhibition match, and 
the training begins. 

Seriously, (he fact that it culmi- 
nates in a boxing match is the least 
important part of the entire movie. 
In past Rocky movies, that is what 
you waited for. You watched to see 
him beat the unbeatable opponent. 
In "Rocky Balboa", he boxes Dix- 
on, but the opponent he's lighting 
is life. 

Stallone's acting is superb. He 
was always comfortable portray- 
ing the character of Rocky (under- 
standable since he created it), but 
he was never this easy to relate to 
as him. There is truly an exeep-

pretending he's 30 again, he's ac- 
cepting the fact that he's not and

to himself that life will not trample 

There are people in this world 
who don't grow complacent and 
let life roll over them. Rocky was 
always portrayed as that sort of 
person. Perhaps that's why I al- 
ways wanted to be him. After seeing

'God of War 2' is the ultimate swan song 



By Mike Webb 

Arts &amp; Entertainment Editor 



Inc 









In 1989, a game called "Prince of 
Persia" was released lor ihe Apple 2. 
Mosi people did not have an Apple 2. 
and yet they still played the game in 
some form. That is because over the 
next several years, the game would 
be ported to nearly e\ery formal con- 
ceivable. Even-one had the chance lo 
experience "Prince of Persia." 

After some not so successful se- 
quels, a company known as Ubisoft 
got the formula right and released 
"Prince of Persia: The Sands of 
Time." Third-person action games 

So why speak of the "Prince of 
Persia" series in a review lor "God of 
War 2?" It's because there would be 
no "God of War" without these influ- 
ential games. The truth of the matter 
is, "Prince of Persia" made the third- 
person formula work well, and then 
"God of War" made it nearly flaw-

The first "God of War" followed 
a man known as Kralos. Being the 
greatest mortal warrior in the world 
gained him the attention of the Greek 
gods. 

After traumatizing events that 
would send anyone over the edge, 
Kratos turns against Are-, and a buttle 
between mortal and god ensues. The 
end result is that Kralos becomes the

"God of War" stretched the PS2

Theatre has a way of mixing comedy and

'Jonny Lives!' but lacks direction 



By Mike Webb 

Arts &amp; Entertainment Editor 



How main hand- arc eonlklcni enough in 
ihcir muMcal \ahdtl&gt; thai they put an exclama- 
tion poini in their name ' 1 would guess that the 
number is quite low, hut there is one band thai I 
know of. and they are Jonny Lives! 

Consisting of Jonny Dubowsky (vocals, 
guitars), Jon Weber (drums, vocals). Christian 
Langdon (guitars, vocals) and Tommy USA 
ihass. vocals). Jontty Lives! have just released 
their debui record "Get Steady" and they axe 
read\ to obtain some recognition. 

"Gel Steady" is an,interesiing debut mainly 
because it doesn't seem to have ,i clear musical 
theme. The records sound is very diverse, and 
though [lie hand's inlhicnces can be heard quite 
clearly, its almost as il each individual song 
could have belonged to a different band. 

.Songs like "Outside" sound a lot like Oasis. 
while oilier songs sound eerily similar lo the 
Rolling Stones, Jet, The Killers, and the Bea- 

Luckily for us, the aforementioned bands 
all have a lot in common with one another, so 
while their influences are heard individually, 
it is not nearly as distracting as il would have 
been if one song sounded like The Beatles and 



the next sounded like Lamb of God. 

Also, though the songs arc very differ- 
ent, they are all well crafted. This makes 
tor an enjoyable listening experience even 
if it is somewhat disjointed. 

This band seems to be looking for an
