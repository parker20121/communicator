Environmentalist discusses issues 



Ky Fcticia Beeching. 
Edilor in chief 

On Monday, nationally known cnvi- 
ronmcnlol aciivisi, Calvin Mitchell, 
Jr. visited itic IPFW campus in an un- 
official capacity, but granted an inter- 
view 10 The Communicaior. 

Miictiell, director of ihc Cenicr for 
Environmental Juslitc in Indianapo- 
lis, serves as one of four national field 
offices for the Ciiincns' Clearing- 
house for Ha7ardous Waste (CCHW). 
Olhcr offices include west, south, 
and Appalachian field locations. 
The national headquarters arc in 
Woshingion, D.C. 

The CCHW began in the late 1970's 
with ihc Love Canal legal victory 
against Die hazardous waste polluters. 
All over the U.S.. calls began pouring 
in 10 ask how it was done, according 
to Mitchell. 

Tbday Mitchell travels nine slates to 
organize grassroois efforts to fight lo- 
cal hazardous waste dumping. He 
serves local groups in Minnesota. 
Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, 
Michigan, Missouri, and Nebraska. 

"I conduct workshops, help groups 
define iheir goals, and offer training 
sessions. Organizing is a learned skill 
and that's what we icach," said 
Mitchell, 

For example, Miichel! cited two lo- 
cal groups and a third group in 
Bloomingion that he has licipcd. 



H.E.A.L. (Healthy Environments 
for All Life) in Marion, Indiana has 
OTganiTCd to prcveni Waste Manage- 
ment from opening a 200 acre region- 
al hazardous waste landfill. 

"Waste Management has been fmcd 
time and lime again." said Mitchell. 

Mitchell mentioned a book almost 
two inches thick, called 'The San 
Diego Repon: The Final Indictment' 
thai lists Waste Management's sins. 

"In Fori Wayne, another company. 
ChcmWaslc is being challenged by 
Dump Stoppers. They have been try- 
ing to prevent ChcmWaste from ex- 
panding in the last four years," said 
Mitchell. 

"ChcmWaste wants to expand and 
put in an ash field that will accept in- 
cinerated hazardous waste from ail 
over the country. Because they have 
been incinerated, the toxins are more 
con centra ted," he said. 

When asked about Paul Conneii, as- 
sociate professor of chemistry at St. 
Lawrence University, who will visit 
IPFW on Saturday to debate the haz- 
ardous waste issue in Allen County 
with Doug Clark, community rela- 
tions manager for Chemical Waste 
Management of Indiana, Inc., 
Mitchell immediately quipped, "Oh, 
I know who's going to win this 
debate!" 

Paul is the most renowned authority 
on incineration and hazardous waste 
disposal in the USA," said Mitchell. 



Mitchell also said that Connett and 
Ralph Nader will speak at the nation- 
al convention of CCH\V May 15 in 
Washington, D.C. 

The third example Mitchell related, 
is the Student Environmental Action 
Coalition (SEAC) in Bloomington. 
The lU Foundation osvns 6,000 acres 
in Nuxubc County, Mississippi. 
Waste Technologies. Inc. (WIT) 
wanted to build the largest hazardous 
waste incinerator and landfill in the 
world there. 

Students in Bloomington, and some 
residents of Nuxubc, an almost all- 
black impoverished county, organized 
to fight and pressure the Foundation 
not to sell. 

"It was a bittersweet victory, but it's 
not over yet," said Mitchell. 

"The lU Foundation refused to sell 
to WIT. but instead sold it to an indi- 
vidual from Riverside, California. 
This man has leased the land widi a 
one' year option to buy to WIT." 
Mitchell said. 

"SEAC students claim that the lU 
Foundation sale was illegal and arc 
planning litigation," added Mitchell. 

Mitchell's observations in die ticld 
strongly indicates diat environmental 
racism is worse than many people 
believe. 

"Forty percent of the USA's haz- 
ardous waste disposal sites are located

Student groups request funds 



UyNgo/.iR. Rogers 
Chief reporter 

IPFW's Student Government As50- 
ciation met on Monday, April 19. The 
meeting was called to order at noon 
with enough student senators present 
10 legally vote on the issues of the 
meeting. 

The main issues were Resolution 
!992/93-k and the budget commit- 
tee's recommendations to Senate for 
student organizations and government 
expenditures. 

Resolution 1992/93-k is the Sen- 
ate's recommend a lion to Chancellor 
Lantz's Smoking Conunittee to elimi- 
nate smoking in the Fireside lounge 
also known as tlie MTV room. 

The resolution. ba.sed on a survey of 
22S students, deems that 'the dun- 
geon' opposite 'the green room' in 
The Fort cafeteria, be the only re- 
maining place where smoking is 
allowed. 

The vote was nearly unanimous ex- 
cept for the one abstinence vote by 
senator Mark King. 

The budget committee, chaired by 
vice president of finance Seemab 
Rashced gave its suggestions to Sen- 
ate for budget allocations of die ap- 
proximately 30 student organizations 
who requested funds. 

The student organizations had to ap- 
pear before the budget committee 
during the week of April 5 with bud- 
gets for their 1993-94 spring and fall 
semester activities. These budgets 
were not to include allocations for 
conference attendance. 

The senate meeting on Monday un- 
covered the committee's prescription 
as to how much each organization 
should receive. The senate then votes 
on the amount which could vary. 

Tlie procedure for budgeting student 
activites states, "after the budget ha? 
been approved by the Student Senate, 
it will be submitted for approval 
10 Frank Borclli, Vice Chancellor 
for Student Affairs, for review and 
approval." 

If Borclli disagrees widi the budget. 
he then meets wiUi the IPSGA Execu- 
tive Branch. If unreconciled, then the 
Chancellor will act as mediator and ■ 
make the Final decision. {' 

Though this is the procedure fon 
budget allocations, wltat happened on 
Moday was that Seemab Rashced' 
presented the figures to the senate. 
There were many questionsTmd much 
discussion surrounding the commit- 
tee's recommendations. 

Many organizations including the 
Arts Group Conference, the Black 
Collegian Caucus. Los Hispanos 
Unidos. Purdue-Indiana Theatre 
(PIT) and the United Campus Organi- 
zation had recommendations by tlie 
cwnmittee at a much lower amount 
than requested. 

A major concern was the proposed 
60/40 percentage split to the athletic 
depanment. an incre^e from the 
current 50/50.

Indian dancer conducts workshops 



By Anita Kumari Steinbacher 
Guest Writer 

Sponsored by IPSGA. IPRV is be- 
ing visited by Tara Priyadarshiiii, a 
renowned dancer of one of India's 
most famous and exquisite art 
forms, the Bharat Naiyam dance. 
She has performed extensively 
tliroughout India and the Asian 
continent. 

Originally from Bangalore, India, 
Priyadarshini has been dancing 
since she was eight years old. 

"I live for dancing. Without it I 
would not be happy. I breathe every 
moment for it," said Priyadarshini. 

For several years she has trained 



under the famous Krishnaveni 
Lakshman, a well-known performer. 

choreographer and teacher who has 
been trained under Rukmini Devi 
Arundale. 

Priyadarshini is currently working 
on a Ph.D, thesis in Dance, at An- 
nanmalai University in Tamil Nadu. 
India. Priyadarshini's Ph.D. guide. 
T.S, Parihasardiy, a famous Indian 
musicologist, has taught some of die 
outstanding musicians and dancers 
in India, as well as overseas, 

Dunng her first visit in die United 
States. Priyadarshini has been con- 
ducting workshops since April 14 
through Friday April 23, from 5:30 
to 6:30 p.m. at the Walb. 



Priyadarshini will perform at IPFW 
on Sunday. April 25. 7:30-«:10 in 
Room 224. in Walb Memorial 
Union, 

Beginning in May. Priyadarshini 
will conduct a series of pcrfor- 
man&gt;.cs and workshop.s throughout 
the country, before leaving for the 
United Kingdom, the first week of 
June. She will return to India, where 
a rigorous schedule awail.'i her. the 
second week of June on. 

Asked about her impressions of 
the UinicU States, Priyadarshini 
states that she is certainly enjoying 
her visit here. She is grateful for the 
warm reception she has received at 
IPFW and hopes to return soon,

new initiatives. We will have less 
(funds) next year because of the 
60/40 split. [We wouldl start with 
new initiatives and [have to] cancel 
next year. All organizauons can come 
back for more money." 

Members of the Black Collegian 
Caucus (BCC) were the only organi- 
zation present to hear their budget 
allocation. 

Partially responding to Seemab 
Rashecd's comment concerning the 
Forensic Team's allocation, "...they 
are not a special interest group.", 
BCC member Fred Douse responded, 
"I feel it's ironic that the vice presi- 
dent of finance [Rasheed) implied 
that the BCC is a special interest 
group when he, as an Indian, joined 
[the BCC) during his campaign last 
year. Or was that different?" 

Douse continued. "I feel that the 
■funding recommendations were inap- 
propriate for the type of functions 
we'd like to put on, howc^'cr I under- 
stand due to the current budget.." 

TTiosc not di reedy influenced by the 
allocations had something to say. 

The director of Multicultural Ser- 
vices and assistant to the Dean of Stu- 
dents, Bcityc J. Poignanj. whose of- 
fice employs the advisors for the 
Black Collegian Caucus, Los Hipanos 
Unidos and die International Students 
Organization, commented on the bud- 
get commitic's decision to not hear 
budgets penaining to conference 
attendance. 

"I am more disturbed by the deci- 
sion to categorically refuse to fund 



conferences, especially since tlicsc 
projects are funded through student 
fees," Poignard stated. "Many organi- 
zations prefer to focus on leadership 
development and broadening their 
perspectives through systematic con- 
tact widi students around the nation, 
rather than to focus on jugglers, 
movies, etc. Both focuses arc legiti- 
mate in my opinion." 

Rajat Suri, Student Body President 
explained, "if the 60/40 split (goes 
through), if fees do not increase then 
the reserve will be 531,000 for next 
year from S80.O0O this year. Elbert 
(president of student senate) said diai 
it is the students mqney we are re- 
sponsible for distributing and with 
diis I agree." 

Not everyone agreed. 

Not everyone agreed, not even on 
die amount to be given to new organi- 
zations like FIRE and UCO. 

"New organizations have no track 
record." budget committee chair 
liasheed said, "but diey must be giv- 
en an incentive to grow. Let them 
prove themselves in die fall and get 
more money in die spring." 

Considering that only three of all 
the allocation suggestions, will get 
die increase, in funding dial they re- 
quested, if the senate votes accord- 
ingly. 

So it appears that with the 60/40 
split, the question remains, 'Why pay 
more for less?' 

The Student Government Associa- 
tion is to vote on \h&amp;st allocations at 
its next meeting Monday. April 22.

IPSGA needs work 



Rctcntly. five IPSGA siiideni 
senators were noliTicd ihai ihcy had 
exceeded itie allowed number of 
four scnaic mcciing absences. To 
avoid drastic measures, such as im- 
peachment, three have already 
turned in Iciicrs of resignation. 

The reasons given for noi attend- 
ing the scnaic meetings arc not un- 
common. Many of us work, study, 
take tests, take care of families, and 
cannot always "(it" everything into 
our schedules. The paper we need 
10 write takes longer than what wc 
planned. 

But. as students, we fulfil] our 
study responsibilities regardless of 
any inconvenience. If wc miss so 
many classes, wc know that we 
must make the proper arrange- 
ments widi our instructors and pro- 
fessors less our work and grades 
suffer. 

When we make any promises, 
moke any commitments, we are 
compelled to keep dicm. We know 
that time and cfTon is spent: never- 
theless, wc have counted these 

COSLS. 

Before student senators accept 
their assignments, they need lo 
count the costs. Tliey need to real- 
ize that they have committed them- 
selves 10 representing the student 



body and that much of IPSGA de- 
cisions, such as budget appropria- 
tions, special resolutions, and in- 
vestigations — all which affect 
IPFW students— are in dieir hands. 

IPSGA has too much work to 
handle to be burdened with disci- 
plining senators who have neglect- 
ed to show up at the meetings. If 
nearly one-third of the reprcscnia- 
tivcs are forced to step down, a 
greater work load is given to those 
who are faithful. 

Why did this situation occur m 
the first place? Were they misin- 
formed of their obligations? Why 
did they bother to nm for student 
senate in die first place? Perhaps to 
build up their resumes? 

IPSGA wants to promote school 
spirit and encourage participation 
in siudcnt-led activities. We wholly 
support them for their considera- 
tion in rcprcscnling us. But student 
government could improve with 
greater care in die responsibility of 
its members and clearer mutual 
communication. 

Those of us who aren"t IPSGA 
members aren't fault free. WE 
could offer our services. Futher- 
morc, we cast the votes. Maybe 
that's the problem: very few cast 
the voles. 




You didn't 

hear it 

from me, 

but... 



by I'M,. Dou-se 
Copy t^dllor 

You didn't hear if from me but . . . 

I. on behalf of several students, 
would like to give a standing ova- 
tion to Candy Hagar and her gra- 
cious staff for their dedication to 
this school. For those of you who 
don't know, the cafeteria staff not 
only makes sure diat IPFW siudcnW 
arc supplied with hot. delicious 
meals, but also covers several of dK 
banquets that arc held here at 
school. When you read this and if 
you're in the cafeteria at the time, 
give them a (hank you because they 
deserve it! 

Well, there's one story I think you, 
the readers, will find interesting. 
This is the current dilemma in the 
nursing department. Now, it has 
been brought to my attention from 
several students in this department 
dial there is and has been a problem 
with the scheduling sy.'stcm. 

Before wc begin to discuss the is- 
sue. I must give you the background 
information. Number one to get in- 
to the nursing department one must 
have on acceptable grade point aver- 
age. It was disclosed to me that 
Ihcy accept the students with ihc 
highest GPAs and then trickle down 
to their cut-off point. Another re- 
quirement is enrollment in courses 
115, and 113 for die first semester, 
and 1 16 the second semester. 

The problem arises for this class of 
students with course 116. There arc 
not enough slots for them because 
of LPN students, returning students 
who have skipped a semester, or 
students who dropped out of the 
course and sign up to lake it again. 

After speaking on the phone with 
Elaine N. Cowen. chair and associ- 
ate professor of the nursing depart- 
ment, she informed me that they are 
aware of the eondici and will handle 
the situation appropriately after die 
final grades have been received. 

She also told me ihot currently 
there arts no plans to open up anoth- 
er clinical. 

Now, before you (nursing smdcnts 
in particular) get upset let's look at 
her problem. To you, opening up a 
clinical may sound easy. However, 
Cowen will have to find a hospital 



and instructor for the students. 
Along with the current budget situa- 
tion on this campus, I'm sure she is 
feeling Ihc light squeeze, herself. 

The solution to this problem: 
Well, it's a tough one to call. First, 
one must look at the deparimcni's 
decision to allow more nursing stu- 
dents in the program than what it 
can accommodate (Now. that comes 
strictly from my source). So, if the 
department is allowing students 
with lower grade point averages to 
nil up the missing gaps when stu- 
dents drop out. they should curb this 
activity. 

Number two: They should give 
preference to the hardworking stu- 
dents who are currendy in die pro- 
gram instead of the returning stu- 
dents and the students who droppwl 
out because of their various reasons, 

Number three: Students must re- 
member that the department of nurs- 
ing is one based on having excellent 
grades and is a competitive area. If 
you don't have the grades, you don't 
have the right to complain. 

And finally please give Cowen 
time lo access the situation at hand. 
She will make sure that all steps arc 
taken to accommodate every siudcni 
within the department. There ate 
waiting lists and they pick die next 
people who are in line. 

On Monday night, the Student 
Leadership Awards Banquet hon- 
ored outstanding IPFW students. 
Out of the 87 students, five of diem 
were from die Communicator. Now, 
what can you any other organization 
say about diat? 

These students are now Who's 
Who Among Students in American 
Colleges and Universities; Scoit 
KeUenbcrger. Publications Board 
student member; Ngozi R. Rogers, 
■ chief reporter; Krisiie Schiundi, 
staff writer; Joyce Slocks, advertis- 
ing manager, and Felicia Bccching, 
editor in chief. Our curreni editor- 
in-chief also won IPFW's Siudeni 
Leader of the Year Award. You go 
girl! 

■ Well, that's all I- have for now. 
hopefully, by next week I'll have 
tome good dish. By the way, next is 
our last paper of the year, so don't 
Forget 10 pick itnip. And remember, 
you didn't hear it from mcl

Festival correction 

Activists to debate 



To the editor: 

The EarUi Day festival information 
sheet sent out lo area media contained 
an error which reared its pesiy head in 
last week's Communicalor. David 
Coririghi, who will be discussing 
"Nuclear Proliferation in the Post 
Cold War Era" at die festival, will not 
be addressing "the massive nuclear 
build-up in countries such as Iraq and 
North Korea," as those countries do 
not have massive accumulations of 
nuclear weapons — cenainly nowhere 
near die scale of arms or related tech- 
nology diat is still stockpiled in the 
United States and the republics that 
the term "massive" is somewhat rela- 
tive, however, it only takes one nu- 
clear bomb to mess up your whole 
day. 

This year's Earth Day festivities 
have a lot lo offer our campus com- 
munity. In addition to the music, 
speakers, workshops, information 
booths, and activities for kids at the 



festival on Sunday, ihcre will be a de- 
bate on Saturday, April 24, concern- 
ing commercial hazardous waste dis- 
posal and Chemical Waste Manage- 
ment's Adams Ccnicr hazardous 
waste dump. Dr. Paul Conncit, a 
chemist and co-editor of the newslet- 
ter Waste Ncft will debate Doug 
Clark, the community relations man- 
ager for Chemical Waste Manage- 
ment's Indiana subsidiary. Michael 
Downs, IPFW associate professor of 
political science, will moderate this 
debate, which may prove to be quite 
lively. Audience members will have 
an equal opportunity to ask cither 
Connett or Clark questions, following 
their opening statements and rebut- 
tals, which each will have an equal 
opportunity to address. 

The debaie begins at 7:30 p.m. this 
Saturday, in die NefT Hall auditorium, 
room 101 , Admission is free.

Kettler is unhealthy 



To the editor: 

1 am an asdunatic. 

1 work in a sick building. Kettler 
Hall. KelUer is now as sick as Class- 
room Medical and Fine Arts, 

Kettler is infused with VOC's 
(volatile organic compounds). I am 
allergic to oil-based paints. California 
prohibits the use of such paints in 
building interiors. Obviously, the po- 
lemial, insidious effects of employee 
sensitivities lo these chemicals con- 
unuc to be ignored at IPFW. VOC's 
proliferate throughout the IPFW work 
environment and as a result of this 
prolonged exposure, my healdi con- 



tinues to deteriorate. 

I am noi seeking sympathy or con- 
solation by writing this. I am just a 
canary in a coal mine. Keep a diary of 
your symptoms for documentation 
when you file for workman's compen- 
sation and participate in the inevitable 
class action suit. 

It is the responsibility of IPFW to 
provide a healthy working environ- 
ment for all. Wake up and smell the 
odors, IPFW.

Illiterates need help 



To the editor: 

A week ago I received a letter from 
a good friend. I became emotional 
when reading the letter. You see I 
knew my friend and she spoke as an 
educated person. When t tried to 
read her letter it was obvious she 
was unable to write: she is an illiter- 
ate aduli. 

In his book. "lUiieraie America." 
Jonathan Kozal states, "one out of 
every three American adults cannot 
read this book". TheThree Rivers 
Literacy Alliance says that by the 
year 2000, unless diis problem is ad- 
dress 912 million American adults 
will be considered illiterate. Kozal 
also reports, "One million teenage 
children between twelve and seven- 
teen cannot read above ihc third 
grade level, and half the heads of 
households classified below the 
poverty line by federal standards 
cannot read an eighdi grade book." 

Eva Wells with the Three Rivers 
Literacy Alliance explains. "Being 
an illiterate does not necessarily 
mean not being able to read or write, 
because there are different levels of 
literacy A proficiently liieraie per- 
son can read at a nintti-grade level or 
above, a marginally illiieraie person 
is able to read on a fifth to ninth 
grade level, while a functionally illii- 
eraie person is able to read at a (ifdi 
grade level or below." 

According to the National Assess- 
ment of Education Progress, 
"Youngsters whose parents are ftmc- 
tionally illiterate are twice as likely 
as dteir peers to be functionally 
illiterate." 

Who is responsible for diis prob- 
lem? I think both die parents and the 
schools, the parents for not involving 
ihemsclvcs enough in the child's 
homework, the schools for not en- 
couraging the parent to get involved. 
To resolve ihis problem parents and 
schools need to work togciher to ed- 
ucate children. Stepping off the 
school bus docs not mean education 



has stopped. Education is an on go- 
ing procea. We need to stop the ris- 
ing number of illiterates and con- 
vince people who can't read to seek 
help. "What kind of help is provided 
for people in need?" 

The Three Rivers Literacy Alliance 
located ai 203 W. Wayne Su-ect, of- 
fers adult basic education, GED 
classes, an enriched prc-school edu- 
cation program, parcnf-child inierac- 
'tiftn atti'vllles; and a parent 'support' 
program. This is a non-profit organi-- 
zaiion which means many of the 
funds come from fund raisers and 
government grants. They also re- 
ceive various kinds of donations 
such as time on cable networks, vol- 
unteer lutoring, and books for chil- 
dren and adults. The books are used 
to provide additional material to tu- 
tor illiterate adulis and children who 
attend the center. 

The Alliance has two learning cen- 
ters located in communiiy buildings. 
The first one is in cooperation widi 
Fort Wayne Housing Authority and 
is located at Miami Village and the 
second is located at New Haven 
United Methodisi Church. 

Some possible solutions to help 
with the number of illiterate people 
in Fort Wayne, adults and high 
school students could become volun- 
teer tutors for the Alliance and at 
their local elementary schools. An- 
other possible solution high school 
students could be encouraged to read 
to a elementary class, by being of- 
fered class credits toward graduation. 

Letting this problem go unattended 
only creates more problems. It is 
time Fort Wayne faces diis problem 
and solves it. If you would like to 
volunteer, or if you know someone 
who needs a tutor, call the Alliance 
at 426-7323. Smcc most illiterate 
people cannot even read this article, 
it is up to you, the reader, to gel help 
to those in reed.

Bobby needs campus 



by CaroljTin Shldeler 
SlafT Writer 

Thursday morning al 
9:00 wasn'i loo early for 
"Bobby" who is only 
seven monihs old. Bobby 
had awakened at the 
much earlier hour of sU 
10 cry for a boiilc. He 
planned a nap later after 
lunch. 

Mommy, wiih "Bobby" 
on her right hip, was 
headed for Career Advis- 
ing Services on the sec- 
ond floor of Walb 
Memorial Union. She 
was in a hurry and 
looked more than a liitle 
stressed. 

"Bobby," on ihe other 
hand, had on his royaJ blue ball cap 
and held a pacifier securely in his 
tnoulh. He looked raflier conndcni. 
His bright blue eyes scanned the sur- 
roundings of the Union as they 
rushed by 

Mommy receives advice today 
about what classes to enroll in for 
ncxi Poll, It will be her first semester 
of college. Mommy will be back to 
IPFW's campus many limes. Chances 
arc. Bobby will not. 

"Bobby" won't be left at home with 
a note pinned lo his crib. He'll have a 
babysitter. But when he's sick, Mom- 
my will stay home with him and 
miss class. 

For the majority qf students, the 
IPFf/ child care issue that resulted in 




a task force assignment and report of 
need came and went without much 
notice or inconvenience. For the mi- 
nority, those mothers with non-inde- 
pcndcnl children, the issue is one still 
needing a solution. 

After reviewing ilie task force's re- 
port, Adminisu'ailon has determined 
that there will be no immediate provi- 
sions made for child care on campus. 

So this Fall, we won't be seeing 
"Bobby" on campus. Too bad. too. he 
was really cute!

I.P.F.W. (Independent Peoples 

Force for War) 

Update, M'lfi;93 

by Colonel Frederick 

While the Purdue insurgency ap- 
pears to be in retreat or stalemated, 
the hostile takeover of [PFW contin- 
ues. Regardless of the conciliatory 
tones of El Presidente Beering and 
Generalissimo Ringel, their desire to 
wrestle conuol of the Fon Wayne en- 
clave has not diminished. Do not let 
the current disinformation in their 
now. more-organized propaganda 
campaign mislead you. There arc still 
ftre fights raging in the administrative 
foothills and bureaucratic jungle. TTic 
barbarians are at the gate. Keep the 
faidi and continue the struggle. 

When Beering was asked at the 
open forum about the "underfund- 
ing" of IPFW (S6.6 million below 
state average, based on full-time stu- 
dent equivalency), he pointed, down- 
staic and blamed the Indiana Com- 
mission for Higher Education and 
legislators (lobby) for an additional 
Sl.l million a year for the nci^t six 
years to bring IPFW up to average 
funding. They were lumcd down by 
President Beering, told not to men- 
tion it agaia Was he being disingen- 



uous at our open fonim?

Update. (M/19/93 
by Colonel Frederick 

I sent a letter to President Beering. 
thanking him for aiiending Faculty 
Senate and appearing at the open fo- 
rum following Senate on April 16. In 
thai letter, I pressed him once again 
to provide us (the faculty, staff and 
students) with a copy of the proposed 
management agreement currently be- 
ing discussed with President Ehrlich, 
Bob Jesse (President of the Purdue 
Board of Trustees), and John Walda 
(President of the I.U, Board of 
Trustees). 

President Beering called me on Fri- 
day, April 16th to iitform me Uiat tlie 
proposed management agreement 
was a board of trustees document and 
was not the concern of faculty. Our 
faculty constitution did not empower 



us to consider such mailers. We 
would get a copy of the agreement 
when ii was signed. He has told us all 
the cardinal points of the agrcemcm. 
He is working for c«r bcncfiL There 
is nothing we need to w ooy abouL 

Go figure. (Editonal eommem) 

He will be meeting with ihe Chan- 
cellor's Community Advisory Coun- 
cil (CAC) on April 29ih to discuss 
ihc proposed managcmcni agree- 
ment. This council is sensitive to our 
needs as IPBV employees. Tliey do 
care about IPFW. If we do not write 
ihese community members and ex- 
press our concerns about these seaci 
negoiiations, we will be very vulner- 
able. I have written them before. 
They do listen. They need to hear a 
veritable chorus of IPFW voices. 

We need ihc support of the CAC in 
ihis effort. They do influence Beer- 
ing. The CAC is comprised of ihe 
most inllucniial members of the Fort 
Wayne community. He should not get 
away wiih easy qucstioas. if we pre- 
pare CAC members for the meeting. 

He should NOT have a nice day on 
April 29lh in Fori Wayne. 

For your clarification and edifica- 
tion: 

We. the ad hoc Management Agree- 
ment Commilii^c, are proposing a lo- 



cal board of control for management 
of tiscal issues, including budget and 
financial concerns. Establishment of 
such a board would ^cmo^■c the West 
Lafayette fiscal control over daily 
managemenL We. then could possi- 
bly lobby on our own behalf fof state 
funds and capital projccis. Thai 
would mean no more glass ceilings 
on building projects and "in-conccn 
salary bleeding" with all Purdue 
campuses when wc have our own 
contingency funds. Our Chancellor 
would be named a Vice-President of 
Purdue and the Vice Chancellor for 
Financial Affairs would be a Treasur- 
er of Purdue. Both would report di- 
recOy to the Purdue (and lU) Board 
of Trustees. Thai can. in no way. be 
misconstrued to be "independence" 
for this campus. If anything, ii 
sircngihcns our ties lo Purdue AND 
Indiana Universities. Wc believe 
strongly in the presence of both with 
equal status. Here is what makes our 
university ihe besi regional campus 
in the state. 

If Ihc management agreement is 
signed without our participaiion, wc 
will go back next year to the state 
legislature with ihc same bill. We 
will lobby our bill uniil Purdue gets it 
righi at IPFW.

The Communicator 



Guest professor brings 
new ideas to campus 



Mitchel 



By Nrozi R Ro(&gt;er&gt; 
Chier Reporter 

IPFW cnicnaincd a gucsi for ihrcc 
days lasi week; rather, ihc gucsi cn- 
icnained/ informed IPFW for ihrce 
days. 

The Africjn American Iniliaiivc 
program sponsored by Interim Vice 
Chancellor of Academic Affairs. 
David McCants, invited Kim Marie 
Va^ Assistant Professor of Women's 
Siudies/ Africans Studies from the 
University of South Florida (USF) to 
IPFW. 

Professor Va/. panicipaicd in ihc ini- 
liaiive program whose purpose is to 
bring African America professors to 
IPFW with Ihc intent of networking. 
The long term goal is lo help hire 
African- American professors and oth- 
er professors of color. The guest pro- 
fessor also had substantial contact 
will! siudcni5. 

The 1990 Indiana University Educa- 
tional Psychology Ph.D. graduate 
had cxicnsivc comaci with students 
during her siay at IPFW. Va/ spoke lo 
eight classes, including sociology. 
psychology, women's studies, politi- 
cal science and fine arts. Members of 
the Black Collegian Caucus saw 
Vaz's documentary video. 'Spirit 
Murder; Stopping ihe Violent Deaths 
of Black Women' and discussed it 
with Iter. 

The video covers the slayings of 
four black women, ages 25. 28. 40. 
and 62, from 'a working-class pre- 
dominantly black and Hispanic com- 
munity in Tampa. Florida.' 

It explores the responses of die po- 
lice, municipal, cocnmuiuiy and press 
to Ihc deaths, noting the low value 
these institutions placed on women's 
lives based on the while norms of ap- 
propriate behavior for women. 

"|Wc should] take the issues in our 
own community and document them 
from our own perspective as an alter- 
nate 10 what we're given in ihc main- 
stream mediu." suggested Vaz. 

'Spirit Murder' is a critique of al- 
leged 'good' and "bad" women, a 



comparison to cases of white women 
victimizaiion and a perspective lo the 
masculinisi idea ihat women should 
not walk the sticcis alone. 

Vaz. in reponse to her discussion 
with students and faculty commented, 
"I received a very positive reception, 
people wanted lo talk about living 
their lives the way they wanted and 
rethinking traditional gender roles. 
Students raised questions about per- 
sonal safely and what they can do 
about ensuring it." 

One 1992 article 'A Coune On Re- 
search Issues On Women of Color,' 
published by Van in Ihe Women's 
Studies Quarterly was ihe topic of 
discussion in a seminar for IPFW's 
women studies faculty. 

Other articles include 'Making 
Room for Emancipatory Research in 
Psychology; A Mulli -Cultural Femi- 
nist Perspective' and 'Creating or 
Transforming an Identity of One's 
Own: A Case Study of Foreign Wives 
in Nigeria.' 

Books by Professor Vaz include: 
Writing For Our Lives; An Interdisci- 
plinary Study of Black Women by 
New Scholars, and The Woman with 
the Artistic Brush: A Life History of 
Nike Davics, which is in progress. 

With her publications, development 
of a Women of Color Minor for 
USF's Women's Studies Deparmient, 
development of a course on alicmaie 
methods of conducting research 
grounded in Feminist Principles- Re- 
search Issues on Women of Color and 
development of a course that analyzes 
the structural systems of oppression 
that hinders the progress of women of 
color in the pursuit of equality and 
justice- Women of Color Studies: An 
Introduction- professor Vaz had much 
to say. 

"The history, culture and accom- 
plishments of African Americans 
should have a central place in the 
general curriculum," stated Va/., 
"which requires both faculty and stu- 
dents to noi jusl put African- Ameri- 
can content in a section of ihe course, 
but to rethink how to integrate Ihat 



material into iheir courses and into 
their lives," 

Jeancite Clausen. IPFW director of 
women's siudies, explained one of 
the things she gained from the USF 
professor, "In the faculty seminar [Dr. 
Vaz] said, 'if you are going to really 
leach about women of color then 
white professors must take them- 
selves oui of the center and put con- 
cerns for women of color in the cen- 
ter of what you're doing. African- 
American faculty need to lake the 
cenier.'," Clausen added, "This focus 
is not from the white social center." 

Professor Clausen agreed that she 
would like to see women studies 
courses as required courses. 

The University of South Florida has 
seven core faculty members in its 
women's studies department; 
African -American, Asian Indian and 
Latin American women that offer a 
B.S. in women's siudies and is work- 
ing on a women's studies masters' 
degree and Ph.D. minor. The 
Africana program, in which Vaz is al- 
so involved, offers a B.S. and is de- 
veloping a minor in black women's 
siudies. 

Professor Vaz also made sugges- 
tions as to how IPFW students, like 
those on USF's commuter college, 
could get similiar programs on its 
campus. 

"First, you have lo talk to the Dean 
about the importance of hiring 
African-American faculty. Secondly, 
you must emphasize the provisions of 
funding for 'retooling' faculty- so 
thai they begin to have lime to devel- 
op more expertise about African- 
American people in literature existing 
in their area; [to be) sensitive to the 
feelings of alienation that exists 
among African-American people" 
Vaz began. "[There'sl a need for es- 
tablishing a viable and strong black 
organization. Also, press professors 
to be inclusive. If [students] don't sec 
themselves in the cuniculum, they 
need to ask why and expect that 
changes are made." 



Continued from page 1 
in three huge minority communities: 
Emclle. Alabama (78 percent black), 
Kcltleman City, California (90 per- 
cent Hispanic), and the ihird is in a 
Louisiana county that is 93 percent 
black," said Mitchell. 

If students mz interested in environ- 
mental issues, the Indianapolis oflloc 
offers internships to college students. 

"We have had students from many 
different majors, including business. 



Butts give writer smoking fits 



By Jorge Rivera, 
Staff Writer 

Indiana Purdue Fort Wayne, may 1 
have your total attention, please. 
With ray sinceresi concern for my 
campus's environmental sake, I 
come and share my dilemma with 
oil. 

It is about all Ihcse cigarette "butts" 
on campus; they are everywhere. 
Nasty, wet-looking, some wilh red 
marks and others, well, depending 
on your choice. Others still on full 
ability lo create injuries or destruc- 
tion if applied indirectly unto forbid- 
den fields. I personally don't leave 
my bull exposed lo the community. 
This, to me. should be discreet. 

Imagine this, after sucking and 
puffing, then throwing it out. How 
disgusting. I don'i think it's quite a 
cute idea to stop on those slimy, wet, 
burning, left there withering ciga- 
rette butts. It only adds power ' 



destruction of our school's appear^ 
ance and harm to our most precious 
environment. 

To me, these "butts" are as if some- 
one threw their nasty "napkin" in a 
public elevator where a thousand 
people will unforlunalely enjoy its 
"beauty and delighi." Belter yet, lo 
me it's like someone throwing their 
"'raincoat" in a public testroom after 



"soaking situation." 

Fellow colleagues, with these 
thoughts I leave you, hoping thai 
when you see another "butt," you'll 
think of my dilemma and consider 
this the next time you are templed to 
toss it aside. But for those who feel 
as I do, don't be ashamed to speak 
out and help mc in "kicking these 
bulls."

Associate professor contributes to 'non-traditional' sociology text 



By Jerl DiinneWy. 
StafTWrlrcr, and 
Felicia Beechint!. 
Editor in chief 

IPFW is a workplace lo many facul- 
ly, bui 10 Patiick J. Ashion, axsociaic 
prorcssor of sociology, this campus 
was also his inspirailon for a icm- 
book siudy guide addressing ihc non- 
[radiiional siudcnt ba»:. This unique 
slant has cxcilcd noi only sociology 
professor* naiionwidc, bui also TTic 
Wall Sircci Journal. 

Ashion has collaborated with Henry 
L. Tischlcr, author of "Introduction lo 
Sociology,' on the new fourth edition 
of the bctok and with a new publish- 
ing imprint. 

Harcoun Brace Jovanovich is pub- 
lishing this new edition of 'Introduc- 
u'on to Sociology.' under the imprint, 
TTic Harcoun Press. 

The Wall Sircci Journal will soon 
feature a siory on iliis revolutionary 
new concept in book publishing thai 
may change the norm for publishing 
and pricing inlroductory lenibooks. 

The book, study guide and study 
skills sections arc aimed al the non- 



traditional student, now called 'the 
new majority student' on campuses 
nationwide, according lo Ashion. 

"It is unusual to have a paperback 
textbook that is comprehensive, has 
an extensive study guide, and is 
priced under S25." said Ashion. 

'The oiher editions of the textbook 
[by Tischler) were already widely 
popular and recognized as the least 
sexist of all major icmbooks." Ashion 
said. "Many lexibooks are gender bi- 
ased against women, Tischler's book 
is rated very high for dealing equi- 
tably widi gender issues." 

Ashion explained diat he has used 
ihe Tischlcr book for his classes for 
several years and spoke frequently 
with the publishers' rcprcscnialives 
widi suggestions for improvemenis. 

"When I would send them suggcs- 
lions. it would be very specific. They 
oficn made the changes I suggest- 
ed with each new edition." Ashion 
explained. 

This non-traditional textbook re- 
flecis the studies made on college 
campuses that show the age ranges of 
siudenis are changing. This is espe- 
cially inic at IPFW where the majori- 



"This book reflects my whole 
whole career for this. It's what 
-Pat Ashion 



life. I've been preparing my 
I do, it's how I teach." 



ly of students arc considered non-tia- 
ditional. TradiiJonal students, in con- 
trast, enroll in college directly from 
high school. 

"In the Midwest especially, ihcre 
are fewer high school students going 
directly to college because of the 
changing economy. Fewer industrial 
jobs, such as Harvester, means that 
older people are enrolling more often. 
Many have forgotten their high 
school level skills and need to take 
remedial courses in maih or English. 
They worry about how they will per- 
form in class and on the tests." said 
Ashion. 

"This book offers study guides, 
learning objectives, critical thinking 
questions, key concept lists, and sug- 
gested readings for the siudeni inter- 
ested in certain topics. These are 
bound right into die book for conve- 
nience." he added.

print lisiened lo Ashion's ideas and 
suggestions on how to create a better 
textt&gt;ook for this new type of studem. 
Ashion worked with Michael O'Hear. 
IPFW director of transitional Studies 
and assistant dean/associate profes- 
sor of Arts and Sciences, to develop a 
suaiegy on the construction of the 
study guide. 

"I've shown it [die book| to a lot of 
people at other schools. They are im- 
pressed with the study skills, study 
guide, and ine)tpensive price." said 
O'Hear. "It's outstanding and speaks 
well of IPFW," 

"This book will be a milestone in 
textbook publishing for introductory 
textbooks; the wave of ihe future," 



said O'Hear. 

O'Hear believes that this new book 
represents what should be happening 
for all introductory courses. After 
other publishers sec how well this 
book does, he hopes thai book bills 
for siudenis will go down. 

'This book is getting a lot of adop- 
tions in the major schools. It will help 
students and if it does well, it will be 
a moneymaker. Then everybody 
wins," added O'Hear. 

Ashton credits being in the right 
place at the righl time for ticing asked 
to do this project. 

O'Hear disagrees ihat chance had 



anything to do wiih it. He sees 
Ashton as very hard-working and 
committed to students. 

"I've known Pat since he came here 
(10 IPF\V in I979|, I think he is one 
of our stars. We can be proud of 
him." said O'Hear. 

When asked lo csplam how his plii- 
losophy and the book arc related. 
Ashion explained, "This book reflects 
my whole life. I've been preparing 
my whole career for this. It's what I 
do. it's howl teach." 

"To be asked to enhance the 
Tischler book was an exciting chal- 
lenge." concluded Ashion.

Men's tennis victories result 
in best conference finish ever 



JlyQuenlinSpciEel 
Staff VVriler 

The men's icnnis icam gathered iwo 
imponmiE viciorics ai Si. Joseph Col- 
lege SaiurJay. April 1 7 agamsi GLVC 
foes SI, Joiicpli .ind USI. IPFW won 
boiti8-l. 

"Wc needed a good performance, 
especially Trom John Brock, Tommy 
Bowman and Scoil Davis for seeding 
purposes," 

All ihrcc siudcnu won both of ihcir 
singles matches. According lo Coach 
Btogan, ihc victories give IPITV iis 
best conference season ever at five 
wins and [wo losses, and provide the 
team momentum going into this 
weekend's conference toumameni. 

'"The conference lourmmcnt is ihe 



culmination of our season, some- 
thing wc try to peak for," said Coach 
Brogan. 

"The regular season secures seeding 
positions for the loumameni, and in 
past years we have usually been seed- 
ed low and hoped to pull some up- 
sets, This year all of our.players arc 
capable of having ii g'rca't tourna- 
ment," said Brogan. 

"We did not have thai confidence 
from top lo boilom in past years," 

Sophomore Dave Krahn. junior 
Randy Sicwari, and freshman Scott 
Miller have been impressive all sea- 
son. Krahn ai numt&gt;fr two singles, is 
6-1 in the GLVC. 9-3 overall. Stewart 
at number four singles, is 5-2 in Ihe 
GLVC, 8-3 overall, and Miller at 
number five singles is 6-1 in ihc 



GLVC and 10-2 overall. 

The doubles teams of Stewari- 
Miller, and Krahn and freshman Tom- 
my Bowman have also had eKccllcni 
seasons. 

"Ai first Stewart and Miller doubtoii 
whether they could play die one &gt;pc! 
but right now diey feel they can hi^it 
anyone," siaied Coach Brogan, 

Krahn and Bowman have been 
steady all year, compiling an 8-3 
record, 6-1 in the GLVC, 

"Anything can happen ai the confer- 
ence loumamcnt. If everyone plays at 
the level they are capable, and stay 
mentally focused, wc could make an 
impact on the conference and set a 
precedence for next year."

HIV/AIDS 

Q&amp;A 



Q. How can I protect 
yourself from HIV 
infection? 

A. • Not having sex. 

• Having sex with only 
one mutually faithful, 
uninfected partner. 

• Not shooting drugs or 
sharing needles and 
syringes. If your sexual 
behavior places you at 
risk, latex condoms used 
correaly every time you 
have sex can reduce, but 
not eliminate, your risk.

Volleydons beat OSU; 
lose top tourney seed 



By Jo AnnSleinforth 
Staff Writer 

The Volleydons went five games in 
order to beat Ohio Stale at OSU Satur- 
day night. 

The 'Dons won as expected, but not 
in three games as ihey had hoped. Be- 
cause iliey didn't win in three, they re- 
ceived the second seed, with a score of 
15-7,15-8. 12-15, 9-15, and 15-12. 

Ohio State won ihc tie breaker 
against IPFW. earning them the HI 
seed in this weekend's MIVA Tourna- 
ment at Ball State. 

Felipe Ralat led the game against 
OSU with 28 kills, closely followed 
by Raul Papaleo hilling 26. Lloy Ball 
had 65 assists. 

Coach Amic Ball stated the outcome 
of the upcoming toumameni at Ball 
State is imporiant lo IPFW. "Their 
home coun is a concern, but our kids 
are up lo the task." 



"With a record of 22-6, this is a 
game of momentum. Every game we 
will have to start over." said Ball. 

Last week's tournament at Ohio 
State placed IPFW in die second seed 
on Friday night. "We played conserv- 
atively, that's why we didn't win in 
diree games," said Mark Frankc. As- 
sistant Coach. 

"Our goal was to win in diree games 
and when we didn't, wc were disap- 
pointed, especially when we had a big 
lead tike that. It's imponam to know 
die team can win die close ones." said 
Frankc, 

IPFW will play No, 14 Ball Slate 
Friday, after Ohio Slate plays 
unranked Wisconsin-Milwaukee at 
6 p.m. 

Saturday's game is ai 7:30 p.m. and 
Ihe winner of that game will decide 
die loumameni title and a spot in the 
NCAA ToiUTiimeiil.
