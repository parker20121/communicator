E-mail not priority 



students 
'booted' 
in Neff lab 



by Jeremy Eccnbarger 
News Edilur 

WiUiin every computer lab on 
campus, a sign of "ethical stan- 
dards" is posted in ihc room The 
framed sign slates the purposes for 
which students may use the facility. 
In its many lines, it says, 
"University computer resources 
should be used for legitimate, uni- 
versity related purposes " 

On ibe ottier hand, there is no 
sign in many of the rooms that lists 
the computer purposes in any order 
of importance 

Recently, several students 
retrieving messages from their e- 
mail accounts tiave been asked to 
leave various computer labs on 
campus The reason given is that 
there are other students who need 
the computers for term papers and 
other related class papers 

"If studenu are mostly working 
on e-mail or word perfect 1 will ask 
if it is a class-related activity If 
then. It's not. I ask them to leave and 
come at a later lime." said Kay. a 
student consultant in a lab located in 



Neff Hall, Room B71. She request- 
ed to have her last name withheld. 

Every student pays the same stu- 
dent technology fee. which is S3. 15 
per credit hour This fee is to pay for 
any upgrades or other compuLng 
needs. While each student is 
required lo pay the fee. each of them 
has an equal opponunity to use the 
faali ties available. 

"We're not telling them that they 
can't read their e-mail. We're sim- 
ply asking them to come back at a 
later time The student technology 
fee is not limitless. There are just so 
many students," said Cindy Elick. 
computer operations supervisor 
"Students have assignments; some 
poor student may flunk a class." 

But what if e-mail is a part of 
class? 

"I require students to activate 
their e-mail accounts, use those 
accounts and use them for class dis- 
cussion," said Steve Carr, assistant 
professor of communication, 'l also 
hand out assigiunenis and offer 
notes on dieir accounts. " 

According to Elick. student con- 
sullanLi. are aware ot the cbai-lines 
(e-mail) She said diat student con- 
sultanLs usually speak up if this is 
die case. She just feels that the labs 
are getting too busy 

Carr feels the umversity needs lo 
address the problem and begin to 
offer suggestions on how to Tix the 



problem. He suggests that surveys 
by the administrators be banded out 
to studcnLs to ask their opinion on 
the subject. By that, he feels deci- 
sions can then tie made 

Students have the q)portunity to 
use a number of labs located on the 
soudi side of campus. There are sin 
computer labs located m Kettler 
Hall, one in the Hclmke Library 
and one in the tiasement of Neff 
Hall. However, no labs are located 
on die north side. 

"We look frequenUy in Walb. 
but there's no space to be freed up," 
said Walter Branson, vice chancel- 
lor of academic affairs. 

Are eight labs enough to suffi- 
aently aid all students? 

"Surely not." said Fenwick 
English, vice chancellor of acade- 
rmc affairs, "tmi they're coming " 

According to English, a sign 
was posted outside each computer 
lab during the second week of 
school The signs list a set of priori- 
ties diat acknowledge the impor- 
tance of school -re la ted material 
rather than e-mail or odier activities 
that can be done at any time. 

Many of these signs have since 
been torn down. 

Both vice-chancellors said dial 
more computer labs are on die way. 
One cuneni project will bnng a lati 
to die Engmeenng and Technology 
Building.

Who says there's nothing inter- 
esting to watch on public access?

which will air on Channel 10 
througboui the month of November.

dents and the community are pan of

ment to help in providing thLs type 
of television programming," said 
Paulina Salvador, an adviser and 



student services cowdinator in the 
department. 

The film gives a historical per- 
spective to many of die events that

addresses the struggle for equality 
and cultural identity in America and

and accomplishmenLs.

yS^mg igmored: Living with a ciisabiiity 



by Paul TUpper 
Editor 

Let me introduce you lo Mary Sbe ba^ 
acquired a disabilily. Although living with dif- 
ferent disabilities results in different challenges, 
it is only important that you know sbe lives with 
one and the pain sbe feels emotionally tends to 
be universal, regardless of which disability one 
has. 

Persons with disabilities tend lo be lumped 
into one category when spoken about. But the 
truth is, being bom with a di.'-abiliiy and acquir- 
ing one at a later stage in life really is dirfereni. 
When you acquire a disability, you have a frame 
of reference of what it is like not lo have diat 
disability So indeed, you know what you'ic 
missing. Mary has fell such a change. 

"I don't know what a 'normal' life is." said 
Mary, "but I do know that I have found it dilTi- 
cult to return to the routints I used to maintain." 

Some parts of Mary's life - and perception 
of life - have changed Tor the better, as she 
explains: 

"I've learned to drop some of my Type A 
behaviors because I recognize how futile it is to 
liy to control some things. I've also become 
particularly sensitive to issues of equahty. to the 
ways m which some people are denied opponu- 



niiics because of who they are or what they rep- 
resent. I hke to think that I have a better appre- 
ciation of what's really important in my life." 

But dicrc are still moments Mary encounters 
thai are not so positive. And there are times 
when she feels discriminated against, which 
produces feelings of not bemg acknowledged or 
accepted Like when sbe shops at establish- 
menLs that don't accommodate persons with 
disabiliLcs. Sometimes when thLs happens sbe 
addresses the manager, which can take as much 
time as a full-time job. 

Yet those limes aren't anything compared to 
the wiihJrdwal of attention from a few of her 
family members, although most have supptined 
her and answered her inquiries since she 
acquired her disability. She describes one of her 
most troubling encounters with a family mem- 
ber: 

"Once, at a family picnic, my Uncle Charlie 
asked me why I was wearing a fool brace. I told 
him that I had stress-Iraclured my fool while 
playing soflball. He laughed and recounted the 
many fool injuries be had mcurred, and the 
crutches he had endured over his 60- year histo- 
ry. Then, he a.sked me to recount, in vivid detail, 
exactly what the doctor told me about stress 
fractures. When I finally satisfied his curiosity 
about stress fractures, Uncle Charlie a.sked. 



'You haven't been spending any more time in 
doctors' ofTices, have you?' Since I hadn't seen 
Uncle Charlie since acquiring my disability, I 
told him about iL Instead of asking me to 
recount, in vivid detail. exacUy what die doctor 
told me about my disability, my embarrassed 
Uncle Charlie said, 'Well. uh. dial's nice. 
honey. We'll talk more when I have time.' He 
practically ran out of the room," 

It is moments of discomfort like Ihis that 
Mary finds most troubling, especially when 
they occur within her own family Bui she con- 
tends dial life IS still very good to her. She has 
family and fnends who arc supportive, and sbe 
has found a career that gives her great satisfac- 
tion. 

But all is not perfect in Mary's world, for 
she still has one wish: for people to team lo 
accept others unconditionally. 

"1 have to admit that 1 agree with Erving 
Goffman, who claims that society does stigma- 
tize people with 'defects.'" said Mary "I'd like 
to see society slop stigmatizing people with dis- 
abihties. older people, people who do not 
always conform to cultural standards of beauty, 
people whose only 'defect' stems from very 
human needs that most people are unwilling to 
acknowledge," 



Harvest of Harmony presents 
(Symphonic Winds concert 



by Cassie RltUr 
Features Editor 

Do you enjoy the sounds that only 
wind instruments can make? 
Maybe it's the roar of the trumpets, 
or the seducing sound of the saxo- 
phone that entice you. If so. then you 
will want to anend The Symphonic 
Winds concert 

The music department is hosting 
a month-long musical celebration 
called the Harvest of Harmony, 
which is a series of concerts that 
spotlight IPFWs numerous musical 
groups. The Symphonic Winds con- 
cert is one of the eight concerts 
scheduled for the month of 
November. 

According to Christina M 
Kulow, direaoT of public relations 
and development in the fine and per- 
forming arts department, turnout lo 
the conceits in the past years has 
been wonderful, especially in die 
Symphonic Winds concen. 

"They have been one of the more 
pt^ular ensembles." Kulow said of 
the Symphonic Wmds. 

The Symphonic Winds will pre- 
sent their concen November 10, at 
2:30 p.m. in Neff Hall's recital room. 
101, 

George A. Cavanagh. associate 
professor of music, will conduct the 
concert Cavanagh is proud of the 
fact that the ensemble is made up of 
students, and not "outside" musi- 
cians. 

"That is one of the things of 
which I'm most proud. We don't pad 
it. We don't add people It is univer- 
sity students only, and always has 
been for the last eleven years." 
Cavanagh said. 

The concert — which should last 
about an hour — will include a vari- 
ety of musical pieces The musical 
repcnoire includes; Harold Bennett's 
"Military Escort." which (aaording 
lo Cavanagh) is good solid American 
inarching music; Percy Grainger's 
"Lincolnshire Posy," which is a 
group of compositions based on 
English folk songs: Uonard 
Bernstein's "Slaval" and Jack 
Stamp's "Cenotaph " 

There will also be a trumpet 
soloist who will perform at the con- 
cert. Doug Haskell, a senior in music 
education, is the second student 
soloist that Cavanagh ha.s had m the 
eleven years that he has been at 
IPFW 



"I've had faculty soloists. I've concert. 
had community guest soloists, but "The group is certainly prepared, 
he's only the 
second student 
soloist," 
Cavanagh 
said "He's 
really very 
good," HasseLI

Native American heritage celebrated in November 




Kevin Locke will perform Nov. 23. 



by Tanuha Washington 
Staff Writer 

Thanksgiving is not the only cause for cele- 
bration in the monlfa of November The ekvenlb 
month of the year is also Native American 
History month and many area residents celebrate 
iL 

United Native American Students (UNAS). 
an IPFW student organization, will host two 
events lo celebrate Native American heritage, 
both of which are free and open lo the public. 

The group will host a Native American 
Forum on a variety of subjects from 1 to 4 p.m 
on Saturday, Nov. 9, in the school's Fine Arts 
Building, Room 204. This event is co-sponsored 
by the Student Activities Board. 

Clarence Syrette, an Ojibwa from the First 
Nation in Ontario, Canada, will deliver the invo- 
cation and discuss burial issues Katrinn Mitten, 
a Miami Indian from Huntington, will discuss 
women's roles in society. Law students from the 
University of Iowa will examine legal issues 
involving Native Americans, Also, Amos 
Cloudman, a Lakota Indian from Redbud 
Reservation, South Dakota, will address reli- 
gious freedoms in Indiana prisons. 
'"A lot of Native American history is left in sto- 
ries and bead work and artwork and paintings on 
the backs of bides but it is also left 
in song and dance. One of our pur- 
poses this month is to shae our 



culture with die general public," said Eva Howe, 
president of UNAS. 

Following the theme of sharing, the group 
will also bring Kevin Locke, an intenutionally 
known Lakota story- 
teller and educator, 
back to Foti Wayne 
Locke was the 1990 
recipient of the 
National Endowment 
for Fme Arts. 

Locke, who is 
making his third 
appearance in the 
Summit City, is an 
indigenous 
(Redwood) flutist and 
hoop dancer and will 
perform from 7 to 
9:30 p.m on Saturday. 
Nov. 23, in Neff 
Recital Hall, Room 
101. The Locke per- 
formance is made

TI7MS Strangely are our soiaIs constri^cted. 

ar}d by 5i4Ch slight ligaments are we boi4Hd 

to prosperitij or ruin. " 



Mary Shelley. English wnier 
(1797-1851! 




by Jeremy Ecenbarger 
News Editor 

We see them in our educational 
facdiues, they cover the shelves in 
our supermarkets and they devour 
us in the work place. They're labels, 
and once something gets 
one. watch out 

Along with everything cLse that 
causes confrontation in our Lves. a 
label is one thing that many people 
seem to overlook. 

My fascination with labels 
began a couple of weeks ago when 1 
was calling the chancellor's office 
regarding a story 1 was writing. 
After dialing his four-digit exten- 
sion, his secretary answered. 
"Chancellor's ofTice" 

i simply asked, "Hi. may I speak 
with Mike WartelH" 

As if 1 made some huge, disas- 
trous mistake, she replied, "Oh, do 
you mean 'Chancellor' Wariell?" 

I realized I had made the mis- 
take, yet 1 was not prepared to have 
it thrown in my face. The chancellor 
probably deserved more respect. 
After all, I am only one of over 
10,000 students on campus. 

Nevertheless, as I began to think 
about the situation. 1 realized how 
often an instance like diis takes 
place in society. Labels r\de our 
government, economy and most 
obviously, our places of employ- 
ment. The question is... where do we 
draw the line? 



IN THE GOVERNMENT... 

Of course, the President of die 
United States deserves the presti- 
gious label On die odier hand, how 
should be use this label is his 
authoritaUve command? 

We have known the statement 
"liberty and justice for all" since we 
were young children. A president 
should know when to put a hold on 
his chain of command. After all. we, 
the U.S. population, are the ones 
who appomied him to the position. 
We put all our faith in one man to 
bnng forth changes m the country. 
The man or woman behind the label 
should not look at himself as a per- 
son with greater power; he needs to 
have an extremely high appreciamn 
for the voters who got hrni there 

Whether it is locally or national- 
ly, people must make sure the label 
does not give more power than it 
deserves. 

IN THE ECONOMY... 

With anything consumers buy, 
they ahnosi always look for brand 
names Try to imagine any clothmg 
store without the labeb of Adidas 
on shoes, Levi on jeans and Calvin 
Klein on underwear. Consumers 
continually put their trust in a man- 
ufaaurer to develop of product that 
wdl give the buyer a positive image. 



A public issue regarding this 
matter is the thought of requiring 
students to wear uniforms to school. 
While some say u may ease the 
lives of many students, there are 
those who feel it limits the child's 
individuality A student's attire 
labels them as to what kind of per- 
son they are, maybe a uniform 
would weaken this idea. 

Labels raise the price of almost 
everydiing. As consumers, we need 
10 be able to look beyond the name 



on the box, tag, etc. These labels 
only give profit; they rarely ever 
offer abetter product. 
IN THE WORKPLACE... 

This is the area where I Tind that 
labels have the biggest effect. While 
diere may be 30 employees working 
in a certain division of an agency, 
there is usually only one manager or 
supervisor watching over them. 
How should management control 
things'" 



Seldom do we see a person who 
was just hired be appointed to a 
major leadership position. Usually, 
an employee starts at the bottom 
and works bis or her way up. 

Often, once employees are 
appointed to management, they 
develop an attitude that the things 
they worked so hard at to get the 
position are no longer unponani 
Therefore, they lay their work on 
the shoulders of those around them. 

While some businesses have 



tned to ease this power by referring 
to employees as team members and 
management as team leaders, the 
same instances occur However, the 
thought was a good one. 

Labels have become controlling. 



Soon we will no longer use the first 
names of diose around us. Each of 
us will be named in reference to the 
role we play in society. .student, 
employee, friend. Why must we be 
sodifricull?

Four more years 



I 



s everyone used lo tbe chanl, 
"Four more years!"? Bill 
Clinlon won In a landslide 
ihai has given bim tbe mandate be 
lacked four yeais ago. 

Bui wbal do Ihc next four years 
bold for die country? 

Since Clinlon never made any 
promises during this campaign, 
ibere will be no vows to break 
while he is in oITice. 

He has basically run on bis 
record for tbe last four years Four 
yean; during which be denied fed- 
eral recognition of same-seK mar- 
riages, ended welfare "as we know 
it" (even though it was a 
Republican plan that be finally 
signed), failed on his pledge to 
give a middle class lax cut. kept 
abortion safe and legal. 

Clinton has been dogged daily 
about Wbitewaier. his sexuality, 
his questionable campaign 
finances and Ihc drug dealers who 
gel tbcir picture taken with tbe 
presideni. We see no end to the 
cnn-.ian( barrage of charges. 

Ross Peroi may be right. This 
country could be headed toward 
another Watergate -sized scandaJ 
which will laisc the level of dis- 
content with politicians to an 
unprecedented level. 

Hopefully, for the sake of die 
country, that will not happen 
Clinlon is tbe presideni and he 
does deserve the benefit of the 
doubt most of itae lime Reagan 



and Bush were given that bcnefii 
during Ihe Iran-Contra fiasco 

Ii even look two years for 
Richard Nixon lo resign after ibe 
Watergate break-in 

Unfortunately, moM of us were 
either very young or were not 
even bom during that restless peri- 
od in American history and Ihere- 
fore cannot compare Ihc unending 
scandals of Clinion to those of 
Nixon. 

If we could make an educated 
comparison, we may be able to put 
Cbnton's lenure into perspccuve. 

Clmton did not have his V,R 
resign in disgrace after pleading 
"nolo ccmiendre ' to charges of tax 
evasion and bribery, Nixon did, 

Nixon was in Ibe midst of an 
unpopular war which took iis loll 
on the couniry and tbe president. 
This only added to the anger 
directed toward the president 
Clinlon docs not have an unpopu- 
lar war waging 3000 miles away 

Neither president was perfect 
and maybe now is the time when 
America, her spin-doctors and the 
media will slop demanduig dial of 
them 

After all, the presideni isjusi a 
man (sexisi reality, we know), 
M«i make mistakes. We all do. 
Bui we should be able to forgive 
itaem for tbeir past mistakes. If we 
did ii for Nixon, lei's do it for 
Clinton. 



Idiots Of the Week 
L 



ast week, the Republican 
National Committee started 

I running ads urg- 
ing people to vote 
against the 

Democrau for 

Congress. 

We see no problem 
in dial- Wbai we do 
have a problem with is 
bow Ibey were pbi^- 
ing the ads. Tbe ads 
bas ically conceded 

the presidency to Bill 

Ginion and focused on trying lo 
keep Clinton away from a "rubber- 
stamp" Demooauc Congress. 

We saw this as backsiabbing 
Bob Dole Dole was nominated by 



Ibis party after engaging in a gruel- 
ing primary process which claimetl 
the candidacy of 
several well 
known members 
of the party 
Now, after 

defcaiing all those can- 
didates, die members of 
the GOP are turning iheir 
backs to tbe man who is 
supposed lo be tbeir leader 

Us shameful and says Hi- 
de ^xiut Ifaeir loyally lo tbeir 
nominee 

Even G Gordon Liddy wouldn't

Letters TO THE Editor 



Multicultural services fires back at column 



To ihe Editor; 

I would like to use ibis forum lo address some 
concMns Paul Tupper raised m bis commentary 
of Thursday, Oct. 31, 1996. "Multicultural ser- 
vices excludes homosexuals." Unfonunaiely. Mr. 
Tupper's asseruons regarding the Office of 
Multicultural Services are not based on the kind 
of sohd reporting which one would expect of an 
editor of a major campus newspaper. 

Mr, Tupper iKvcr interviewed me nor directly 
quesUoned me about: il) ibe extern of die con- 
cerns and responsibilities of the Office of 
Multicultural Services, nor t2) asked me about 
my attitudes towards die gay community. His 
conclusions are unfounded and unsupported by 
Ibe factual evidence be failed to gather His kind 
of reporting is an example of "attack journalism'" 
that has done great injury to all minorities, 
including members of the gay and lesbian cooi- 



The Mission of (he 
Ofnce of Mullkullural Services 

First, let me slate that "The mission of 
Multicultural Services is to serve as a support 
system for A/ncan Amencan, Hispanic. Native 
American, Asum Amencan and international siu- 
denis as well as ai-nsk students who are enrolled 
at Indiana -Purdue University Fori Wayne, and to 
assist m die development, execution and evalua- 
tion of recruiDnenl and retention efforts, includ- 
ing outreach serMces. geared for students. The 
adjunct mission is to articulate a}nc£ms of those 
students lo appropriate officials and to mamiain a 
positive connection and working relationship 
between the university and diverse groups," The 
point is that homosexualily Ls pan of ibis office's 
concern because there are minonty and inlema- 



oonal students who are gay. 

A.S for programming diat targets the gay com- 
munity as well as other diverse commumties. on 
several occasions last spring we worked with 
Native Amencan student organiTalions lo spon- 
sor Curtis Ravenwolf, a Native American homo- 
sexual with AIDS Both programs ended up 
being canceled. When United Nauve Amencan 
Students and United Sexualities sponsored Curtis 
Ravenwolf this past summer, of those piesenl. 
half were studenLs of color. In addition, the 
Office o( Mullicullural Services is sponsoring the 
artist Joyce Scoll as part of Spring of 1997's 
Diversity Week. Scoll's art work addresses issues 
such as race, ethnicity, gender, class and sexuai 
orientation. My point here is ibat we discus.scd 
the Joyce Scott visit in Mr. Tupper's presence at 
die Diversity Week Planning Commiliee meet- 
ing. As 10 the question about why diere is a com- 
mittee for Diversity Week: Diversity Week 
comes out of die larger body of the Diversity 
Council, which was appointed by die Chancellor 
ihree years ago to create a campus envwonment 
that welcomes diverse cbaraciensiics, back- 
grounds and experiences I became tbe director of 
Multicultural Services one year ago. 

Tbe second issue 1 would like to address is the 
content of tbe class for which Jane Banks mviied 
me 10 lecture. Although the cour&gt;e topic of Com 
422 was "Women, Men and Media." I was invit- 
ed to specifically address [be topic of "African 
Amencans on Television. " As for Mr. Tapper's 
question in class concerning tbe way homosexu- 
als were portrayed on die sitcom "Roc," my 
response was that 1 have only seen one or two 
segments of that program and that I did not care 
for il Regarding the particular segment which 
was referred to, I said, "I did not see il and really 
could not offer an opinion about it." I also said, 



"Il was a 30 minuie sitcom ^mJ 1 am not sure bow 
well tbe issue of homosexuabty could have been 
addressed in that amount of lime." A good 
reporter should report what is said as opposed to 
dieir interpreiauon of what is said. 

My third and final point is in response to the 
blanket stalemeni that Chns Patterson is not a 
friend to die gay community. I question on what 
that stalemeni is based, since Mr. Tupper has 
never asked me personally about my views or my 
involvement in the gay community. As a matter 
of fact, I was one of the members of die IPFW 
faculty and sialT who wrole a stalemeni of sup- 
pon to the East Allen County School Board for 
Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Studems. 1 also sup- 
poned Ihe AIDS Task Force rundraising event 
which highhghtcd a film produced by Marlcm 
Riggs, an Afncan Amencan who died from 
AIDS 

The bigger question that should be addressed 
is whether there should be an office within 
Multicultural Services that addresses issues of 
concern for ALL gay students and faculty. 
Furdiermore, should diis be an office thai 
addresses ALL amcems of social equity? Mr. 
Tupper has apparently made up his mind on these 
questions However, should he take time to re- 
examine bis assumpUons and predisposiuons by 
coming lo die Office o( Mulucultural Services, 
be may be compelled lo confront the facts that 
were diere for the asking the first lime around. 
It's time for Mr Tupper to pracUce the kind of 
cultural change he preaches in his columns by 
obtammg all the evidence Our doors are (^n to 
him and lo all IPFW students who have concerns 
aboul social equity ai IPFW.

To die Editor: 

There has been many a lime 
when 1 was quite perturbed upon 
reading an anicle in Ibe 
Communicator, bul diis is tbe first 
time 1 have been so moved as lo 
wnic a response. After reading the 
ediior's anicle, "U.S. should follow 
Bniam's example" in the Oct, 24 
issue, ! ibougbl to myself, "Tbe 
Ignorance of mankind never ceases 
lo amaze me." That ignorance was 
quite pervading throughout this arti- 
cle 

After being raised in a family m 
which bavmg firearms in the house 
was Ihe norm, and after coming to 
die realization thai my right lo own. 
bear, hunt and protect myself and 
my family was commg under fire. I 
became very iniercslcd in the gun 
conlrol debate. Over the course of 
recent years, I have learned tbe tnitb 
aboul fuearms. about people and 
aboul the powers that are trying lo 
disarm die Amencan people. It was- 
n't long until 1 became an avid patri- 
ot for the principles which our ont«- 
grcat nation was founded upon. 

As a weU-informed patriot of die 
United States. I am here to tell those 



who read thus letier that tbe only 
way 1 wdl ever give up my guns is 
when diey're pried from my cold, 
dead fingers. Why? Because 1 
choose NOT to give up my GOD- 
GIVEN RIGHTS The framcrs of 
the Uniied States Consiiluiion and 
die Bill of Rights, the same ones 
who had a band in the Declaration of 
Independence and who laid down 
their lives in tbe name of liberty and 
justice, enumerated in our nation's 
founding documents certain 
unalienable rights. They are not 
privileges to be handed out and 
laken away They are rights ! A priv- 
ilege is something given to you by 
another person. A nght is something 
that is inhereni fhe Declaration of 
Independence states. "We hold these 
tnidis to be self-evident, thai all men 
are created equal, thai they are 
endowed by dieir Creator with cer- 
tain unalienable Rights, ihat among 
diese are L^e, Liberty and die pur- 
suit of Happiness " 1 would like lo 
believe diat all of yoo who are read- 
ing this believe whole-heartedly in 
dial revolutionary statement If you 
don't, then go fmd some other coun- 
try to live in where diey don't hold 



to this belief. You'll find out soon 
enough what it means to be free, and 
wbal il means to have your right to 
freedom taken away from you. 

So many Amencans take Iheir 
freedom tor granted They take for 
granted the inhereni nghls dial were 
won back for diem through the 
blood of our Founding Fathers. 
What you don't know, you fmd easy 
to give up. And that is exactly 
what's happening in our nation 
today. The Amencan people have 
grown to look towards Big BroUicr 
(the government) for their secunty, 
and toward the corporate money 
holders for whom diey work for 
Iheir security. The American people 
have grown soft and weak and are 
all loo willing to give up dieir righu 
and dieir libcriy for the litile bit of 
security that Big Brother gives 
them. 

When you let the government 
provide your security for you, what 
will you have become* A slave A 
puppet, A parasite who cannot live 
widioui die sustenance provided by 
its host. You cease to be a man. Is 
thai what you want? It's not what I 
want. And it's sure not what 1 want 



for my children. And I'll be darned 
if I'm going to sit idly by and lei it 
happen. 

Few people seem to realize diat 
diis is exactly where our nauon is 
headed — more than thai, it's where 
our world is headed. It's exacdy 
where those who are in power want 
us lo be so diey can have even more 
power 

By giving up our Second 
Amendment right lo keep and bare 
[sic] arms, we are giving up our 
abihly lo provide ourselves widi our 
own security, and we are giving up 
our ability to protect our unalienable 
rights which we should hold as dear 
lo us, for what is life without diose 
nghis? 

I could write an entire book on 
ihissubjecuhuiasiiis, I've already 
gone over tiw two-page limit, so I 
am forced to leave this incomplete. 
However. 1 would be more than 
happy to wnte more another ume if 
anybody is interested in hearing 
aboul the truth. 

Sincerely and patriotically, 
Jason Deaihe

Volleydons count down to tournament 



hj S. Brant KeHey 
Sports Editor 

Last week. IPPiV's women's volleyball 
team began to show some of the dominance 
and promise which propelled ihem to a 16- 
maich wiiming streak during the first half of 

^Ji the season with three straighi-sei wms over the 
Great Lakes Valley Conference opponenis m 

d four days. 

TTiis, despite injuries to Iwo key players 
and missing outside hitler Tiffany Manin to 
the flu for pan of the week. IPFW coach Tan 
Hcffron and the Volleydons have cUnched the 
Give Blue Division championship with 
reduced depth as fceslimen outside hitlers 
Ldur.i l,.twM&gt;n and Karen Brown suffered 



injuries and are most likely out for the season 
Already two matches ahead in the Blue 
Division. IPFW lamed ihc Si, Joe College 
Cougars Wednesday at Rensselaer. 15-9, 15-6. 
15-11. In each game, the young Cougars 
would slay with the 'Dons until the midway 
poinu then falter before IPFW's skill and 
experience. 

"That's what young teams do." Heffron 
said "They stay with you for a while, then 
Uiey fall apari. 

"I ihoughi we played prelly well Tbey 
played better than the first lime ihey played 
us," Heffron said in reference to an earlier 
direc-game sweep by the Volleydons al the 
Gates Center

10 action. IPRV ripped Blue Division second- 
place runner Southern Illinois University- 
Edwardsville in a thrce-suaighi match, 15-1, 
15-7, 15-3. in die division clincher. Both teams 
started off jittery at the Gales Center, but the 
Volleydons settled down, the Lady Cougars 
did not 

"We were ready for a war." Heffron said. 
'This was the match we had been preparing 
for 

'They played probably the worst against us 
as anybody this year." HelTron said "TTicy ran 
a very high risk offense which requires good 
passing, and we had 12 service aa's. 

"We played well, but we weren't pushed." 
The freshman and sophomore -laden SIU-E 
team, only in its second year of varsity com- 
petition, dropped their fourth Blue 
Division match, handing the division title 
to IPFW. which has a lone conference 
loss. The division tide also puts the GLVC 
toumameni al IPFW. 

Despite their youih, liie Cougars atv 
the GLVC's best blockers; IPFW suffered 
dial slatistic a liitle. allowing only two 
blocks over the maicta. 

With the division title locked up. the 
Volleydons honed their skills on the 
University of Indianapolis on Saturday 
and grounded the Greyhounds. 15-8, 15-2, 
15-8. 

"They put up a much better fight 
today than Ibe first lime we played them," 
Heffron said "Tbey made us cam every 
poini. and we did " 

In the first game, the Greyhounds 
kept pace with the 'Dons until the eighth 
point, when the Dons rattled off the nexi 
seven lo win the game. 

In the second game, IPFW gave up 
the fust two points, then scored the nexl 
fifteen to win die game. The Uiird, and 
final, game of die match was much like 
die first, widi UI and IPFW tied at eight 
points apiece before the Volleydons fin- 
ished the maich with Uie final seven 
points. 

Heffron said he thinks his team is 
returning to ihe fonn shown in the first 
half of the season.

Victory in regular season finale 
gives Mastodons hope for playoffs 

All-American candidate Harper scoring champ 



by S. BranI Ktlley 
Sporti Editor 

IPFW socca coach Terry Stefankicwicz 
said he would raihcr meci lop-scedcd 
Lewis University ihan sccond-sccdcd 
Universily of Wisconsin-Partcside if the 
Mastodons made Ihe Great Lakes Valley 
Conference toumamenl After splilling lasi 
weelcend's matches, be got his wish. 

The Mastodons uavelcd lo Highland 
Heights. Ky. lo meet NorUiem Kentucky 
University on Saturday nighl and dropped a 
bean-rending match in Ihe final two min- 
ules. They also dropped lo seven confer- 
ence losses, milking a win on Sunday after- 
noon against Bellannine College necessary 
lo get the lasi lourrLamcni bid. 

Siefankiewic/ described Saturday's 
match againsl NKU as "ihe most bizarre 
soccer game I have ever seen." 

After giving up a lone firsi-half goal lo 
the Noise, the Mastodons submitted anoth- 
er questionable gr&gt;al lo sian second-half 
action before IPI-"W captain Mike Harper 
and Brandon Combe noiled goals of their 
own lo even the score laie in die match 

"We sianed knocking il around, win- 
mng 50-50 balLs lin the second halfl." 
Slefankiewicz said. With just four minutes 
left, Justin Labnmi broke with the ball 
alone toward the goal, and as he 
approached, he hesitated, halting the keep- 
er. but ibsn put ihe ball straight inio the

"I see our team coming back," 
be said. "I see the team's attitude in 
practice and before the matches as 
better" 

Saturday's win boosted IPFW to 
13-1 in the GLVC. 25-7 overall. 
This week, the Vollcydons host 
BeUaimine College and Northem 
Kentucky Universily before the 
tournament starts the following 
week 

"The next three weeks is what 
their (the Volleydons'] go^ are 
about all season," Hcffron said. 



keeper's waiting hand.s 

Al the two minute mark, the Norse went 
ahead on a penally kick and scored dieir 
last goal just 100 seconds after 
Siefankiewic/. replaced goalkeeper Mati 
Schmiiz with a field player lo add offense. 

The 4-2 victory left the defending con- 
ference champion Norse widi a 6-3-1 
GLVC record. The loss dropped the 
Maslodons lo 3-7 in the GLVC and placed 
die fate of the tournament's final seed on 
Sunday's match with Bellarmine, also 
vying for die eighdi spot. 

Bellannine started the match with a 35- 
yard shot over keeper Matt Schmiiz' head 
in die first minute But die glory for 
Bellannine was brief, because after Uiat, il 
was all IPFW. as the Mastodons look the 
match, 5-1. 

"We started the game off great," 
Bellannine assistant coach Graham 
Merriweaihcr said. "But after that, we did- 
n't play at all 

"That was probably the worst perfor- 
mance by our back four all sca.son " 

Jusl four minutes alter the inaugural 
goal, freshman Kevin Weigand shot home a 
similar ball passed to him from Harper. At 
the 24di minute. Weig;ind struck again, and 
Justin Labrum added a thinJ goal only 
seven minutes later for a 3-1 lead. Within 
85 seconds. Harper added lo the goal-fesi 
with his fust of the afternoon to finish firsi- 
half scoring. 



"We had some nice combinations in the 
first half." Siefankiewicz said of his leam's 
offensive play. 

TTie 'Dons, with match already in hand, 
added insult lo injury when Harper chipped 
home his second goal over the keeper to 
put the slake in the Knighls* hean for die 
final score. Labrum assisted the last three 
goals. 

"Their forwards turned our backs 
inside-out all aflemoon." Merriweather 
said. 

Including die Oct. 30 match against St. 
Francis College. Harper put home six goals 
for the week, giving him 17 for die year 
and vaulUng him to die GLVC individual 
scoring championship. 

On Wednesday. IPFW will iravel to 
Joliet, III., to face conference champion 
Lewis University ag.iin diis sca.son. The 
Flyers defeated the Maslodons earlier, on 
an early second-half goal, die only one of 
die game. 

Despiie fielding the nation's second- 
ranked defense, Siefankiewicz said he 
diinks the Maslodons 
can surprise die Flyers ^ ^ ^ ^ ■ 




"I warn lo meet 
Lewis." he said "[Bui! 
Wisconsin -Park side, 1 
don't want to meet 
diem."
