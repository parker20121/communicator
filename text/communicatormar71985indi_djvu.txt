Lottery profitable, 
not morally wrong 



Speaker ol Ihc Indiana House of 
Represcnia lives, J Robert Dalley, 
npposes Uie InsIlluUon of en Indiana 
■late lotlcry becsioe it is "contrary lo 
Ihe work ethic - U gives the Idea of 
something for noUiing." 

The lollery bill Involves calling for a 
consltlulional amendmenl repealing 
Indiana's ban on lolleries. II was passed 
by the Indiana Senate on Jan. 29, and 
will probably appear in - (he House 
around March IS 

Opponents of the bill say il preys on 
ihe poor, bccaiiac H gives Oicm the Idea 
they can get rich quick by spending their 
hard-earned dollar on a lottery llckeL 
How Ignorant do these people (hlnk 
lower Income families are? 

If an Indiana family is starving to 
death, il is unlikely the head provider is 
going lo spend all of their milk and bread 
money buying lottery tickets. If there's 
a gambling fiend out there that bad off, 
he's going to cross the state line to buy 
Ohio or Michigan lottery tickets anyway. 

Ohio and Michigan made between $235 
million and SZSO million dollars in profit 
in Ihe 1984 fL-ical year by selling lottery 
tickets. All of that profit went to benefit 
Ihe state's educational system. Who can 
give a good reason not to have fl lollery 
inlndiana, when it works so well in other 
slates? II generates revenue without 
raising laxcs. What more could we ask 
for? 



ticket The Indiana Citizens Against 
ILegalized Gambling have one of their 
own. as a matter of fact. They say the 
most likely buyer of a lottery ticket Is In 
the lower one-third of the income scale. 

But other studies, like one conducted 
In New Jersey (wluch. incidentally, 
made a proHl of tl59.7 million dollars on 
its lottery last year) indicate only IB 
percent of lottery players make less than 
113,000 B year. 

But so wha t? Who is Ihe Sta le to police 
how poor people spend their money 
anyway? There are people out there. 
Intelligent though poor, who don't mind 
the idea of 3 state lottery. If they cannot 
afford to play il, they won't. But let's not 
be so potroniiing as lo tell ihcm, "No, 
you must not fritter your money away 
like that. So we'll Just keep gambling 
illegally In Indiana so you won'l be 
templed." 

Currently, gambling goes on In 
Indiana unabated by its illegality, and 
the state is reaping no benefils from il. 
We highly doubl an Infliana State Lot- 
tery will demean Ihe moral character of 
the stale, but it's a safe bet it will 
generate enough Income lo make Itself 
worth gambling on.

Analysis 

There Is alio the story c&lt; 
ISU-E guard Sieve Jackson, 
B Fm-1 Wayne native who 
jch Doled a I South side. The 
e-fooM sophomore canned a 
team-high 23 poln Is and gave 
Ihe Maslodm guards all Ihey 
could handle for me 
evening. Jackson, whom 



bail. 

Also notable was the play 
of IPFW Junior Jeff Fullme 
The B-fooH forward canned 
]1 poinls, a single-game high 
for any Mastodon Ulis 
season, and grabbed nine 
' rebounds Fullove also 
played the entire overtime 
wllh four goals, which

laUve of the way he played 
during his career; diving to
