Super-chancellor candidate warns 



Snyder: future doesn't work 



John W. Snyder, 
chancellor, University of California at 
Santa Barbara, visited Indiana-Pur- 
due in order to be interviewed for the 
job of super chancellor last Thursday 
and Friday. 

Today and tomorrow William A. 
Jenkins, dean of the School of 
Education, Portland State University, 
Portland, Oregon, will be on campus. 

When Snyder was asked why he 
would leave California for Indiana, he 
referred to a quote, "I've seen the 
future and it doesn't work." 

He noted that there seemed to be 
no hard feelings regarding affirm- 
ative action on this campus. He said 
that he got this impression because he 
had not been asked any questions 
regarding his feelings 



Snyder also noted that there is a 
strong need at Indiana-Purdue for 
local autonomy. 

Snyder received his Ph.D. in 1954 
from the University of Minnesota in 
ancient history. 

He became at teaching assistant 
in 1951. In 1953 he was promoted to 
instructor. He taught Greek and 
history at Bethel College and then the 
University of California at Berkeley. 
In 1956 he transferred to Indiana 
University at Bloomington and was 
named an assistant professor of 
history. 

In 1961 I.U. promoted him to the 
rank of associate professor. Then in 
1967 he was awarded his full 
professorship in history. During 1961 
and 1963 he was also a visiting 
professor at the University of Kansas 
and Kagazian College in Beirut, 
Lebanon. 
He began receiving his administra-

X-rays/ skin tests 
available here 

A Mobile X-Ray Unit will be on 
campus to administer skin tests or 
chest x-rays April 23 and 24. 

The tests are sponsored by the 
Student Health Services. The skin

Cane happy with 
election results 



By TOMMY FRANKE 

Russell Cane, better known as 
Rusty, is the newly-elected student 
body president. In an interview, 
regarding the election, Cane remark- 
ed, "One thing I was really happy 
about was that so many people voted 
even though it was still a small 
portion of the total enrollment." 

Cane, who was elected along with 
the rest of the Un-Party ticket, 
received about 54 per cent of the votes 
against Charles Pratt and the 
Alliance for a Campus Together 
(ACT). 

"I think that there was a good 
slate elected." Cane said. I think the 
goals that the Un-Party campaigned 
for are realistic. Our goals concern 
student problems and I think they can 
be solv ed. If you've got a problem, 
why is it unrealistic to try to solve it? " 

He added, "1 don't mind com- 
promising with the administration but 
when they start hacking the students 



have an image of not backing down 
for anything and I Ihink it's time now 
lo change that." 

"I feel that the Un-Party n 



paid off and showed the students that 
it's not going to be the same old

counseling. 

"I have talked to a lot of people 
who have had problems with 
counseling. We plan to work on that so 
that by fall students can start getting 
some decent counseling. The main 
problem is that everybody waits until 
it's time to register to go in to see the 
counselor. 

Cane is planning to work on some 
scheduling with the administration in 
order to remedy the situation. 

Cane said that one of the more 
important goals is to continue the 
funding of the Communicator so that 
the students will be able to get the 
paper free next year also. 

"There are a lot of good people on 
this campus who would like to get 
involved but they haven't been 
approached. My student government 
is going to go out and maybe walk 
people to class and find out if they are 
interested in any facet of student 
government. We have to go out and 
get the students; we can't wait until 
they come to us. The students will be 
able to get more involved by our going 
out to the students." 

Cane plans to start working full 
time in June in his job of student body 
president. He is taking over the post 
formerly held by Brock R. Able. Able 
must certify the election results 
before Cane officially takes office. 

Pat Teagarden was elected as 
Cane's vice president, which means 
he will serve as president of the

Mastectomies bring problems 



Un-Party chuckles 

One of the lighter elements of the recent student election campaign 
was the Un-Party's platform of promises, all neatly printed on glowing 
chartreuse posters. A closer examination of the promises will show why 
they are worth a chuckle. 

First of all, the Un-Party candidates promised (a) a reduction in 
parking fees, and (b&gt; construction of basketball and tennis courts on 
campus. We humbly inform them that (a) parking fees will be reduced 
next year, and (b) basketball and tennis courts will be constructed next 
year on campus. This was established long before the Un-Party chose 
glowing chartreuse as its party color. 

Second, the Un-Party promised to cut tuition fee increases. Again, we 
humbly inform its candidates that a one-dollar per credit hour fee 
increase is coming next year, regardless of what Rusty Cane and 
Company do between now and then. 

Another humorous-painfully humorous-item was the promise to 
lower food prices in the cafeteria. Given today's rampant inflation, 
especially in wholesale food prices, lower cafeteria prices just ain't 
likely. If the Un-Party can do it, millions of American housewives would 
like to know how. 

The best promise of them all was the one to improve the music 
concerts. Obviously, Cane, Yann &amp; Co. think they can do a better job next 
year than Cane, Yann &amp; Co. did the last two. 

Even though the platform gave us reason to smile, the Un-Party 
candidates were serious about the promises. The newly elected 
representatives seem dedicated to follow through on those promises. 
Dedication is probably 95 percent of what makes a student government 
good. 

Rusty Cane and the Un-Party have a difficult year ahead of them. 
They wili need this dedication to get them through. The Communicator 
wishes them Ihe best of luck in their endeavors. 



Efficient election board 

This year's student body elections proved to be interesting and most 
unique in comparison with past elections. 

The campaigning was done on a grass rools level with both parties 
striving to reach Mr. Average Student, which they did. 

The issues were (usually Die same as other years with the exception 
of Ihe emphasis henifA pl.ireil on Die fact Dial il was lime to terminate the 
ripping off of students. 

Perhaps l he most surprising element of the elections was the manner 
in which the Student Election Board ran the voting procedures, 
campaigning policies and regulations, and the vote tabulation. 

There appeared to be no flicker or flaw in the efficient method that 
the Student Election Board utilized. Nor were there any complaints from 
either party stating that the board was stacked with persons affiliated 
with one party or the other This was definitely a precedent. 

So once again it is "hats off" time to the members of the Student 
Election Board for the outstanding job they did regulating the student 
body elections. One would only hope that the precedent they established 



By AUDREY GELLIS 

Sometime ago, I wrote a column 
criticizing the medical establishment 
for ignoring the postoperative mental 
health of women who have undergone 
mastectomies (surgical removal of 
the breast). 

Typical of this insensitivity was 



Cancer Society spokesman (yes, a 
man) who admitted that many 
women suffer severe postoperative 
depr"ssion but who insisted that all 
these women were emotionally 
unstable in the first place. 

I asked women who had under- 
gone this surgery to write to this 



column in order 
experiences with c 
response v 



share their 
■ readers. The 
i overwhelming and my 
thanks to the women who 
were kind enough to write, as well as 
my apologies for not answering each 



as other medical experiences. 

These letters are not to be con- 
strued as a scientific study, of course, 
but simply the stories of individual 
women. On an upbeat note, all the 
letter-writers reported their husbands 
were understanding and supportive; 
however the women I heard from all 
indicated marriage of long duration. 

I did not hear from widows,

Fascist trend feared in U.S. 



By JEFFREY ST. JOHN 

"The march of fascism," wrote 
the late John T Flynn, "would not 
have been possible had it not been for 
the leadership it got from men who 
were known as liberals or radicals. 
Fascism was a leftist job." 

Flynn wrote these lines in "As We 
Go Marching," published in 1944, a 
year when fascist Italy was already 
defeated and the Allies were driving 
to deliver the knock-out blow against 
fascist Germany Flynn wrote of the 
origins and evolution of these 
totalitarian systems as a stern 
warning that with the end of World 
War II fascism could emerge in 
America . 

Now "As Wc Go Marching" has 
been recently republished (Free Life 
Editions. 41 Union Square, New York, 
NY. 10003) with stunning relevance 
to what has happened to the American 
economic system since 1945 and 
particularly lo recent statements by 
allegedly liberal economics profes- 
sors from universities like Harvard. 

For example, Harvard professor 
of economics and winner of the 1973 

Wassily Leonlief. on March 14 
advocated a principle of fascism: 
economic planning by government. In 
fact, he advanced the idea of reviving 
an FDR New Deal brainchild, the 
National Resources Planning Board 
iNRPB) .The idea was originally sold 
to President Franklin D. Roosevelt by 
seven Harvard and Tufts economists 
with Dr Alvin H. Hansen of Harvard 
as NRPB's chief adviser. 

Flynn in his 1944 work pointed out 
that when Congress discovered its 
real purpose, il forced its abolition. 
NRPB's aim was to recast "The 
whole economic and social system." 
AS Flynn noted, "based primarily on 
the settled conviction that the 
capitalist system was dead." This 
was precisely the rationalization 
offered by the liberals and radicals 
prior to the rise of fascism in Italy and 
Germany. It was also the rationaliza- 
tion offered by the liberals and 
radicals prior to the rise of fascism in 



l.eontiei on March t-l for a revival of 
the NRPB as a modern super-econo- 
mic planning agency of government. 
"The great difference between 



which it owns and in the fascist state 
the government plans for industries 
which are owned by private persons. ' ' 
The recent revival talk of 
widespread government planning for 
private industries of America was 
triggered by the chairman of the 



f Economic Adv 



1973, 

_ of the 
American Economic f 

"Maybe we need an economic 
planning agency like the Japanese or 
French," Stein said, "if (govern- 
ment i is going to be as much involved 
in the details as it's becoming." 

This columnist a month later in 
Washington asked Stein, in a 
face-to-face interview, whether he 
favored such planning. He said flatly 
no and that his remarks "were 
distorted by those favoring such an 
approach." 

This is not the case, however, 
with Stein's predecessor, Paul W. 




McCracken. "We may be on the eve," 
he stated, "of a restructuring of our 
policy machinery into a 
of economics, such as the 
c planning agency in Japan." 
The above is significant for 
several reasons. First, Japan is in the 
grips of a roaring inflation far 
exceeding our own due primarily to 
its planning agency. Second, 
McCracken's reluctant endorsement 

illustrate another point underscored 
by John T. Flynn. Namely, that while 
liberals and radicals paved the way 
for fascism, it is the cooperation of the 
political left and right which 
ultimately makes fascism possible. 

"Most of its poisons," he wrote, 
"are generated not by evil men or evil 
people, but quite ordinary men in 
search of an answer to baffling 
problems that beset every society. 
Nothing could have been further from 
the minds of most of them than the 
final brutish and obscene results. The 
ganster comes upon the stage only 
when the scene has been made ready 
for him by his blundering precur- 



Herbert Stein, well-meaning and 
allegedly dedicated to free market 
principles, committed a major politi- 
cal blunder by even suggesting the 
possibility of government planning, 
thus providing an opening wedge for 
those who do want it. For example, 
Harvard Prof. John Kenneth Gal- 
braith seized on Stein's statement, 
asserting that Republicans like Stein 



planning and 



singly 

rily the right direction. 
It's the inevitable direction." 

The revival of greater and 
greater government planning is the 
very type of fascism which we fought 
a major world war to defeat. John T. 
Flynn's "As We Go Marching" offers 
us reference to judge ideas being 
i at places like Harvard by 



To listen to many proponents of 
redistributing the wealth one would 
get the impression that it benefits 
everyone, and that confiscating the 
fruits of one person's labor and giving 
it to another can produce only good. 
But by very definition redistribution 
means force, and when force is used 
someone must get hurt. It is ironic 
that while today's youth are clamour- 
ing the loudest for more government 
programs to redistribute the wealth, 
it is young people who are many times 
the most hurt by them. 

Perhaps the best example of 
youth as the victims of redistribution 
is Social Security. In no other scheme 
is the victim so clearly defined as 
being youth. 

While Social Security has been set 
forth as a system of old age 
"insurance," it is nothing but a 
disguised scheme for welfarism. It is 
a forced system of taking care of the 
old according to their "needs" as 
interpreted by Congress. Taxpayers 
are told that they are paying into a 
fund from which they will receive 
benefits when they become eligible. 
But the fact is that this fund contains 
less than one per cent of the total 
liability of the S.S. system-the rest is 
in the form of IOUs. The S.S. taxes are 
not put into a fund at all. In fact they 
aren't even spent as they come 

money in advance (inflation) or 
borrows the money as it is needed to 
pay the benefits. 



Social Security is a system in 
which youth have nothing to gain and 
much to lose. The only ones who make 
out in it are those who paid into the 
system for a few years and then 
retired. Those who started paying S.S. 
taxes late in life when the system was 
set up in 1937 really cleaned up on the 
benefits in relation to what they paid 
in, whereas those who started paying 
into S.S. in their youth have been, and 
are being, soaked hard. To break 
even, a person has to start paying into 
the system at about age 40! A man 
who starts paying S.S. taxes today 
age 22 on an average annual income 
of §10,000 can expect to pay $50,310 
into the program; the most he could 
expect to receive back if he and his 
wife live to their life expec tancies is 
$25,950. That amounts to an over- 
charge of 524,360. 

Moreover, the youth of today who 

professional career of some sort will 
probably never receive any of his 
money back from the program. 

Assuming he does not retires' 



until age 72 to receive Social Security 
benefits, which is six years past his 
life expectancy! 

Social Security hurts young 
people in yet another way: it has 
helped to accustom them to depend- 
ence upon government. In very real 
terms, Social Security marked the 
beginning of the redistributive men- 
tality in America. It has paved the 
way for many interventionist policies 
for which youth will pay dearly in the 



Our present tax structure is 
another form of redistribution which 
has youth as its prime victim. The 
progressive income tax does the most 
harm here. If all income in the U.S. 
over $25,000 per year were taxed 
away completely it would produce 



to support the government but rather 
to redistribute income more equally. 
It has its most devastating effect on 
youth in that it destroys capital and 



standards of living as the con- 
sequence. That could mean a lot with 
today's high unemployment among 

When a young man tries to go into 
business he is hit so hard with taxes 
that many times he is forced out of the 
market. After 48 per cent of his 
company's profits are taken by the 
corporate income tax, the progressive 
income tax takes another big chunk 
out of his personal earnings, which 
cripples his ability to compete with 
those businesses which are already 
established. 

Another redistributive tax which 
is hurting youth is the Estate tax. The 
Federal Government alone takes up 
to 77 per cent as an estate when it is 
passed on to the children. This is a 
vicious tax which has an especially 
destructive effect on capital. Many 
times the family has to liquidate 
much of a business just to pay the 
estate tax. Many young people today 
are unemploved because of such an
