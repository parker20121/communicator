Fcitare uncertain 



for technology fee 



Bv NoL Beckley 

EWTOH 



Three weeks ago.the Purdue 
BoiUd of Tnisiees raised ihe 
icdimilogy fee ai IPFW lo 
S4 15 per credit hour. And there is a 
po^ibiliiy ihal ihc funds raised by 
the lechnology fee wilj be reallocat- 
ed 10 cover in-clas^ computers. 

Tliis possibility would break the 
original agnvmenl made between 
the Indiana Purdue Student 
Governmeni (IPSGA) and Ibc 
administration tha-c years ago 

According to the the minutes of 
the ITI'C meeting, the agreement 
specifically excluded, "goods and 
services targeted al supporting uni- 
versity administration or insinic- 
(ional iniiiaiivcs— for example, 
equipment and materials designed 
for use by instructional pei^ionnel in 
or outside of classrooms, laborato- 
ries and similar instniclional set- 
tings," 

IPSGA Comptroller Casey 
Lengacber said no one on the com- 
mittee is completely against tbe stu- 
dents and \i)cu wishes. 

"They're cither totally on the 
students side or wavering in 
between," he said. 

Lengacber said he was con- 
cerned with the bck of students on 
the ITPC. He said he would like to 
see at least 25 percent of Ihe com- 
miiiee be students 

"I don't think 1 alone can prop- 
erly represent 11,000 students," 
Lengacber said. 

He also said he was concerned 
with the raising of the technology 
fee because ii was done by the 
Purdue Board of Tmslees with no 
mpui from IPFW smdenis 

"I would have like (o have seen 
tbe Board of Trustees come to the 
students," he said 

No one ai IPFW has given 



Lengacber a solid answer about why 
the (echnology fee was raised. 

Lengacber said he contacted a 
F*urdue University ofTicial about the 
problem and said he was told there 
were problems with funding at tbe 
state governmental level 

"If the students arc paying for 
everything, ihey need more repre- 
senlation," Lengacber said, 

"There was some sentiment in 
the nPC for expanding die allow- 
able expenditures." said Steve 
Hollander, assistant professor of 
English and linguistics and a mem- 
ber of the ITPC. 

Hollander said the committee 
decided nol to expand the use of 
funds after they were shown a copy 
of the first IPSO A/ university agree- 
ment. He did not rule out the possi- 
bility of the adimnistraiion trying to 
amend tbe origuial agreement at the 
next meeting on July 31 . 

Hollander and Lengacber wrote 
tbe current policy on the use of tech- 
nology fee funds 

Three priorities were outlined in 
the policy: 

• Preference will be given to the 
expenditures thai will benefit the 
largest number of students. 

• Preference will be given lo 
proven and useful technologies 

• New technology expenditures 
will be compauble and complemen- 
tary to die existing system 

Kerry Adkins, senior, said 
whether this happens will depend on 
the new IPSGA 

Every year tbe university tries 
to infiuence and sway the new stu- 
dent administration and sooner or 
later the administration will get its 
way, Adkins said. 

"What's going to happen is the 
university is going to lum their 
wheels until something breaks (in 
the IPSGA)," be said. 

The rcallocaiion is not going to 
happen according to Walter Branson 
vice chancellor of financial affairs 

He did say that there was a 



chance m the future after there are 
enough computer labs, the alloca- 
tion may change. 

"We've (FFPC) talked about 
broadening tbe use of the technolo- 
gy fee the majority of the money 
will be used to keep Uic open labs 
current and up to date." Branson 
said. 

Branson also mentioned there 
will be a new computer lab in the 
science building. 

He said he did not believe any 
reallocation would break die origi- 
nal agreement between the IPSGA 
and tbe university. 

There has also been some stale 
money donated to increasing tech- 
nology at IPFW None of that 
money can go to recurring costs 
with phone lines, upkeep of labs and 
technical a.ssisiancc from Computer 
and Data Prixessing. 

Three years ago. the IPSGA 
approved by a referendum vote a 
technology fee of S3 to create com- 
puter labs for student use outside of 
class. 

The original technology fee 
raised S600.(XX1. created four new 
computer labs and 100 new comput- 
ers. 

The referendum was disputed, 
by Adkins. because the voting was 
during "dead week." tbe week 
before finals. The referendum dou- 
bled the lumoui of tbe IPSGA elec- 
tions The IPSGA mailed an infor- 
mational packet to ail students, but 
the mailing took place the weekend 
before the voting took place. 

Adkins said he felt the deal 
between the university and the 
IPSGA could have been much better 
for die students 

This dispute set off an argument 
in tbe student government involving 
iwiJ senators, the IPSGA president, 
bis cabinet and mined the campaign 
of one student senator Adkins is one 
of a few siudenLs remaining who 
was actually a pan of tbe onginaJ 
technology dispute.

IPFW adding soccer field complex on McKay farm property

Staff Whiter 



IPFW is a campus that seems lo be con- 
stanUy growing. Whether ii is the growing 
popularity of its theater department, build- 
ing a new science building or die construc- 
uon of a new parking garage, the campus is 
constandy expanding. 

TTie next step the adininisiraiion has 
decided upon will be taking place on the 
other side of tbe river on the McKay farm, 
across from tbe Wizards stadium An esu- 
tnated S3 miLion will be used in order lo 
brmg a community park to the grounds 



"Foundations bought the land for us 
back m 1988; we were told lo do something 
for tbe community," said Butch Percban. 
adileiics director. "Our theme has been 
youth education through spon complex." 

At this lime, plans include building 14 
outdoor soccer fields and two indoor fields, 
a bridge, a road and a parking lot on die 155 
acres of land All the outdoor fields will be 
irrigated. 

The onginal bid IPFW received includ- 
ed Softball fields and baseball fields, but 
Walter Branson, vice chancellor of fmanaal 
affairs said tbe university only wanted soc- 
cer field,s. 

fill- loial cost, Branson said, will be 



around SI million for 14 soccer fields 

"We needed to develop the property," 
said Terry Stefarduewicz. soccer coach 
"TTie current soccer fields arc continually 
flooding, and we can't build on that " 

According lo Stefankiewic/,, the plan to 
build die park have been ongoing for ibe last 
four years. However, when several founda- 
tions donated SI, 3 million to the campus 
plans began to go into effect 

"There won't be a campus in the country 
Uiat ha.s these facilities," said Slcfankiewic/. 
"Everything is going to be state of the an." 

The two indoor fields are scheduled to 
be completed by January of 1998 
Stefankiewicz said that the outdoor fields 



will be completed later that yeiir The entire 
park will go into operation sometime in 
1999 

"We plan lo add buddings over there 
later,"" said Stefankiewicz 

The buildings will include facilities for 
tennis, volleyball and basketball A swim- 
ming pool is being considered al-io 

Percban thinks tbe new park will defi- 
nitely be a peik for the entire campus, noi 
just the adiletics department 

"Our main objective is to aid in educat- 
ing die public." said Perchan 'It really 
doesn"t affect die athletics department much 
at all." 

When asked, Perchan said that the ath- 



letics department ranks m the lower half in 
comparison to other college campuses, 

"We"re in tbe lower half in regards to 
funding and somewhere in the middle with 
our facdities."' said Percban, 

Perchan says that the volleyball depart- 
ment is defmitely the top athletics program 
on campus. Their goal is to try to elevate the 
other programs to its level. 

"We have good coaches and great stu- 
dents," said Perchan 

"Academically were as sound as ever. In 
fact, 40 percent of die students involved in 
athletics had high honors last semester. 
Thats bener than I've seen in a long time on 
any campus,"'

Undergraduate enrolbnent m bodi departments also increased, 

Other departments witnessing larger enrolhnents are communication, 
computer science, electrical engineering technology and psychology. 

Freshmen enrollment increased by 7 9 percent and eOinic student 
enrollment was steady with 9 4 percent of total enrollment, 

Accofding lo the IPFW news bureau, the mcrease was die result of 
increased class offerings in areas of high student demand 



Ibis year's fhree Rivers Festival kicked off on July 12 with a parade

versus 
abstinence 

Should schools teach sex edu- 
cation or should they concen- 
tiaie on teaching abstmence? 

The battle lines have been drawn 
between two coalitions which sup- 
port quite difTerent policies. 

Both have decent arguments; 
Planned Parenthood and other suni- 
tar agenaes say that teaching absii- 
Dence is naive. 

Focus on Family is concerned 
that the schools will teach a confus- 
ing message of abstinence, while 
telling sexually active youth to have 
safe sex. 

At stake are large government^ 
block grants eannarked for absti- 
nence training The states need to 
^}ply for a grant which will give the 
state the funds it would need to start 
an abstinence program. 




Sex education proponents 
beheve money will be diverted from 

their governmental grants to help 
pay for the ab.stinence program. 

We support the idea of absti- 
nence because it is the only sure way 
of preventing unwanted pregnancies 
and AIDS 

We support sex education 
because we would prefer noi to 
return to the dark ages of the 1950s 
when people would be ostracized for 
gettmg pregnant ouUide of marriage. 

There is no clear black and white 
on this issue, but at least both sides 
have valid strong points. 

Both sides have strong supper 
from the country. But there have 
been no smdies to prove that absti- 
nence traimng works 

Then again, how well has sex ed 
worked^

point. You probably have begun to 
get this mental image of me standing 
on a soapbox trying to recruit you 
into the "vegetarian regimen." Nope, 
not gonna do it I am not even going 
to try to convince you to become a 
veggie. Making such a radical 
lifestyle change is a pei^onal deci- 
sion that you must make on your 
own volition Doing such a thing for 
either nutritional or moral reasons 
involves a lot commitment and a 
major lifestyle overhaul. As I've 
found out, it's not something to do 
on a whim 

It was relatively easy to become 
a vegetarian, as I already wasn't eat- 
ing the foods that I vowed lo avoid. 
However, there have been some 
stumbling blacks in my road lo the 
most ethical Ufe possible. First, my 
husband (who wilhngly jomed my 
htdc veggie adventure) and 1 had to 
eliminate certain, um, shall we say, 
cheap lunches that we had formerly 
substituted on: bye-bye Hamburger 
Helper, bye-bye cheapo sausage piz- 
zas and, unfonunately for my hus- 
band, bye-bye lunch time bologna 
sandwiches It would surprise you 
how much food is made with some 
type of animal product. Many types 
of rice aiHJ frozen dinners have 
chicken slock as an ingredient 
We've gotten very good at reading 
labels. And, with some detective 
work, we've survived our meal plan- 



ning crises surprisingly easily. Heck. 
we don't even eat out of boxes any- 
more We co(A real food: veggie 
casseroles, stir-frys, lasagna and 
even veggie chili. 

The second obstacle is sdll pre- 
senting problems to us. Eating at a 
restaurant has become a very tricky 
adventure diat does not always come 
out in our favor, We have become 
experts at where we can and cannot 
cat in Fort Wayne We first gave up 
our beloved Hot-n-Sour soup. 
because it is made with chicken 
stock. We no longer order queso at 
certain Mexican restaurants because 
it has meat in it also. To further com- 
plicate things, certain restaurants are 
completely off-limits, as they serve 
nothing that we can eat— not even a 
salad without meat or seafood on it. 
There are, and I must be fair in say- 
ing this, a few restaurants that cater 
to us veggie-lypes in the Fon Wayne 
area, so it's not as if we're going to 
starve or anything. It's just that our 
choices are extremely hmited in cer- 
tain cuhnary arenas. 

My parents, meat and potatoes 
people, find this vegetarian lifestyle 
absolutely hysterical they're con- 
vinced that we're going to crack and 
reven back to our old lifestyle, I 
diink not. My two younger brothers, 
15 and 21. also love lo try to rattle 
our nerves with dead aniinal jokes. 
We are not amused, but lake it fairly 



well 

My husband's friends have yet 
to quit making fun of us— we're 
apparenUy "wimps," since we don't 
eat meat. One of them went so far as 
to send us a cute little comic strip 
aboui a vegetarian, but signed the 
envelope from "A Friend " 
Unfortunately for him, we don't 
know anyone else who lives in his 
postmarked city In good humor, I've 
vowed a solemn revenge against 
him. One day soon, he'll find a hide 
black and gold item tacked to his 
car's windshield. That's lU alumni 1. 
Purdue alumniA'eggie Freak I. That 
ought to even up the score a bit. 

Joke all they want, 1 like being a 
vegetanan What I'm doing ties in 
with my moral stance in diis world. 
I warn to leave dus worid in a better 
stale than 1 entered it in, and killing, 
whether it be animals or people, 
doesn't accomplish that, in my hum- 
ble opinion. I also am eating a heck 
of a lot less fat Uian 1 was previous- 
ly. 1 swear that my blood must be 
flowing more freely ui my veins 
now But even 1. righteous though I 
try to be. must admit that the smell 
of hotdogs at a Chicago White Sox 
game a few weeks ago made my 
mind wander a bit. So does the smell 
of hamburgers on die grill at the

Letter to the Editor 



Student irked by comments, decision 
of campus administrator 



To the Editor; 

I have just put down the July 3rd 
edition of the Communicator and 
fmd myself, once again, perplexed 
by a decision that was handed down 
by die administration. I refer to ttie 
back page ariicle entitled. 
"Administration bans classroom 
advertising by student groups." I am 
perplexed at the way Uk administra- 
tion gels away with dictating shi- 
denis nghts. 

This banning of classroom bul- 
letin boards for campus group adver- 
tisement is jusi one of the many uni- 
versity infrmgements dial is dictated 
to students without concern for the 
students' point of view, or, even 
worse, concern for student represen- 
tation during these judgments. 

AU students have the right to be 
represented on all campus commit- 
tees whether it is an appeal board or 
a campus communication commit- 
tee. Many .students have appeals that 
arc heard without student representa- 
tion. Many decisions are made con- 
cerning the actions of students with- 
out student representatives at crucial 



meetings This, I think, is a tragedy. 

Unfortunately, diis tragedy is 
played out by many different charac- 
ters. The leading cbaracier is the stu- 
dents themselves. Their tragedies are 
their lack of desire to spare Uiree 
hours a week, lo sit on many of die 
committees and appeal boards, their 
lack of desire to stand up and speak 
out when decisions concerning their 
actions are further limited by diis 
univenity and their lack of desire to 
insure thai Uieir rights for student 
representation are met by their stu- 
dent govemmenL 

Even though the students lead 
this play, it is Ihe villam that is most 
disturbing. This university pndcs 
itself with die idea diat tbey are there 
to meet our needs, yei policy is con- 
siantly being made without the inpul 
of student represeniaiivcs on dicse 
policy-making committees. The uni- 
versity knows that this happens, and 
what is most disturbing of all is that 
they lei it happen while givmg the 
appearance of condoning it. How? 
By always staling that they have no 
control over whether students are 
appointed to committees, and if no 



appointments are made, dien they 
have no conunl over whedier dial 
appointee shows up or noL "Oh. it's 
not oiu^ fault," administration says. 
We'll just let ihe student government, 
which turns over every year, take 
care of iL Hell, by die time the new 
president is esiablished, half the year 
is over and many of the policies have 
been dictated by the university com- 
mittees. 

Tuition increases, fee assess- 
ments and expenditures, campus 
group advertising alt seem to be 
decided in Uk summertime or at the 
beginning of the installation of a new 
student govemmeni. The university 
has taken every opportunity to insure 
dial students have not been present 
when major decisions concerning 
their welfare tiave been decided. This 
fact IS confirmed by Dr Borelli's 
quote: "We voted at a time when 
there were no students present at ihe 
meeting, not that it would have made 
any difference " This ideology is die 
greatest tragedy of all.

Turning 21 ; not all that 



uuiiu.w^.mi^mm 



Just as the 
summer 
fluctuates 
in its weather 
conditions so do 
the trials in a 
person's life 
Last week, it 
came, I saw and 
it kicked my 



ass. Il is the 




lime in life that everyone looks for- 
ward to in high anticipation The 
point where we turn the ever memo- 
rable 21-years-old. 

We anticipate il. Ai ibe ages of 
19 and 20, we listen as your friends 
share stories about their eventful 
limes at the bar or beer tent. 
Whether it was the latest bar Tight, 
love triangle or hot new band. I 
heard them all. Yet. as the time 
slowly crept up on me, my anticipa- 
tion eventually turned into fear. It 
was lime where 1 wa.s expected to 
drink, have a larger social hfe and, 
most fnghieningly. to become an 
adult 

Hell, that's a hard thing lo lay 
on a person's shoulders at one time. 
Adulthood, ihal word just scares me 
to death. And as the days began lo 
dwindle down to that big day, flash- 
es came dirough my mind. Words 
like responsibility, finances, 
employment, relationships.... 
ehh. .hit me in the head. 

So, days before my birthday. I 
panicked I was wnling resumes and 
going through interviews in my 
sleep I bad to hurry- time was limit- 
ed. Yet, everywhere i turned a door 
slammed in my face. No one wanted 
or needed me. It was not a good 
thing for my self-esteem 

It's strange. At schtwl, your 
Just as normal as can be It did not 
matter whether you worked ai 
McDonalds, drove a I'inio. and 
wore sandab bought from K-Man 
Now. 1 was expected to have a 
career, not just a job. a Mustang, 
not a ten speed, and Calvin Klein 
Jeans, rather Uian the cheaper 
Bugle Boys, While ihe latter two 
didn't really affect me, my employ- 
ment status was a defmne concern 

E&gt;on't get me wrong. 1 gues.s 
everyone has to sian somewhere, 
but what do you tell a girl, that 
gorgeous one sitting across from 
the bar, when she asks you what 
you do for a living? How do you 
stand up to the guys wearing solid 
gold chains around their necks and 
money spilling out of their pockets 



a.s they step on the dance 
floor' 1 mean I am the fir^t to 
say It. "I'm Jeremy and 1 am a 
po&lt;ir. lost and confused col- 
lege siudenL" Admilttng it is | 
only half the battle, or so I 
heard 

Nevertheless, ihe time 
c:ime and there I was stand- 
ing, dancing and laughing 
with my friends. I was no 
longer the young, responsible 
one. I had become the young, 
inexperienced "new kid on 
the block." So I drank and kept my 
mouth shuL 

Thursday, July 10, the big day, 
wasn't bad- People were loo busy 
giving me dnnks to ask me any 
questions. I was a bit. I drank, joked, 
and danced my way into people's 
hearts. Yes, 1 was "the stud" in a bar 
full of regulars- 

So, 1 went home with a smile 
on my face, whether il was from the 
alcohol 1 did not know I found the 
answer to that the next morning. 

Then came Friday, I had 
planned my vacation at a perfect 
lime to enjoy an exciting four-day 
weekenti. when I went oui with an 
entire new batch of fnends. So 1 
drank and tned to forget the night 
and conversation once again. 

Finally. Saturday. 1 hit the big 
city of Indianapolis It was time to 
face reality By then, my stomach 
could no longer lake the alcohol and 
my legs felt like jelly. 1 was forced 
lo talk. 

Therefore, 1 mingled and tned 
to keep conversations mininial. I lis- 
tened a lot, and for anyone who 
knows me, I'm usually die talker I'm

one. I had become the young,

a giver, nol a receiver. 

To my surprise, these people 
were no-better than I was. In fact, 
their lives were 10 times more com- 
plicated. You would nol have 
believed their problems And 1 
thought, "These were ihe people I 
was trying to impress?" 

So, I breathed, blew a sigh of 
relief, and. of course, started brag- 
ging about myself Ha. it was a riot. 
I was fine, cool and still siudly. 

Yet, it was dien I realized that 
the bar is probably really not my 
scene. Don'l gel me wrong, it can be 
great fun. Yet, I don'l intend lo be 
visiting as often as many do My 
evening of enjoyment is more Uke a 
night dealing out a game of euchre. 
going fishing or playing volleyball. 
On the other hand, a nighl of danc- 
ing or karoke is always enjoyable. 

1 had panicked, as always. 1 
looked at it as another turning point 
in my life Yet. it was just a number 
Now I get to play with the big kids, 
on a whole new playground. 

So, once again. I say, "I'm 
Jeremy, and 1 am a content, pretty 
much broke, and sometimes drunk 



college student," Hey, I can deal 
with that, for now. 

By Ihe way. I'm still looking 
for a job.

/building a world 



for the deaf 



A look at hopes 
for the future 



BV jEFFfiEY BaAT7 

Guest WnirtR 



Id the eyes of the beholder, the 
scenery is a beautiful environ- 
ment. Colors sparkle the land- 
scape , green grass, colorful 
nowers ard plentiful trees flour- 
ish. Coniemporary buildings blend 
into the naiural environment with 
beautiful landscaping It is a small 
village with 10,000 people situat- 
ed a few minutes from downtown 
Fori Wayne A unique suburb of its 
own. 

It is the classical uiopia of, for 
and by the deaf A beautiful model 
of its own. the only kind on the 
face of the earth. It is a deaf com- 
munity taking a leading role as a 
model for the world to be rvoud 
of. There is tranquillily and a 
sense of peaceful harmony among 
fellow brothers and sisters sharing 
a common bond. Each of us recog- 
nizing and accepting one another 
for the inability lo hear is our com- 
mon bond Olack and white, 
Muslims and Cbnstians. east and 
west, rich and f&gt;oor— negative 
viewpoints are not spoken in the 
local dialect. 

Working logelher in unity, 
each to hts and her own role in the 
"Master Plan," there is a steady 
focus with no distiaciions. It is a 
meaningful purpose, a destiny 
controlled by the "children of a 
lesser god." In charge of our own 
lives without the altitudes of 
oppression, discrimination, preju- 
dice, ignorance and paiemalism- 
we strive to advance the quality of 
our own lives In die spint of 
cooperation and teamwork to 
make a dream become reabty. 

The Utopia, although bumot- 
ously suggested by local deaf fel- 
lows as "DeafviUe." has yet to be 
named It consists of a community 
invested on tens of acres It offers 
a combination of all aspects m 
daily life, including the basic 
physical, mental, social, spiritual 
and financial needs. The needs arc 
provided by the deaf, for the deaf 
and of the deaf. 

The layout of our Utopia is 
beautifully designed to intercon- 
nect the function and acce^ibility 
of varying areas It returns to the 
simpliaty of a village life in a 
modem and advanced world full 
of complexity The area includes 
the residential, social and com- 
mercial areas 



•RESIDENTIAL 

Tlie residential subdivision is

and the eldaly A majonly of resi- 
dents are deaf although hearing 
people are welcomed to become 
friendly neighbors. The residential 
subdivision blends condomini- 
ums, townhouses. houses, retire- 
ment and nursing homes and inde- 
pendent living homes into a bcau- 
bful byout in private areas for

3 Rivers Festival 

Beer tents show best &amp; worst 



By Lisa Zinn 
Copy Editor 



As always there is a something 
for everyone ai Three Rivers this 
year especially for ibose 21 and 
older. Granted there are some things 
to beware or ai these 21 and over 
events You have your big crowds, 
unbelievably loud music, pusby. 
sweaty people and of course the 
occasional conccn goer that decides 
to teich all over your sandals... gotta 
love the hccr icnis! 

The regular festival tent (now 
known as the GTE Plaza) is located 
al the brand new Headwaiers Park 
near many of the other festival 
activities This year's tent is show- 
casing several bands. Already, the 
Fort Wayne conimunity has wel- 
comed Ibe local band that is hitung 
it big, the Why Store Luckily the 
lent was large enough to bouse the 
many who wanted to show support 
10 iheii hometown boy. lead singer, 
Chris Shaffer. The Why Store can 
really make a place "hoi" and it's 
crowd was certainly "feehn' fine" 
after their concert last Saturday 
nigbi. 

The GTE Plaza also showcased 
the group Jars of Clay last Sunday 
evening. This was an all ages show 
that many enjoyed 

Tliroughout the festival week, a 
variety of bands arc playing the 
lenis. Cheap Trick. Ricochet and 
Loverboy are some of the groups 
visiting ibc festival lent this week. 

Even though many people enjoy 
the big name groups, it is often the 
local bands that many enjoy the 
most These bands will be found 
r^lhcr easily at what some people 
call "the odier tent " The Wngley

Veggin' out 



Bv Shelley Poater 

CUUNARY RePORTEH 



Vegetarians on the lookout for 
appealing foods to wder when din- 
ing out in Fon Wayne wiU not be 
disappointed this summer. All ref- 
erence to vegetarian cuisine in this 
article assumes an "ovolacto vege- 
tarian." An ovolacto vegetarian will 
eat animal products such as milk, 
cheese and eggs, as long as the 
food is not obtained by slaughter- 
ing an animal Chefs have light- 
ened up their menus for the sum- 
mer months and vegetarian cuisine 
plays nicely into these special 
menus Additionally, some Fort 
Wayne restaurants have given veg- 
etarian creations a standing place 
on their regular menus 

Mallory's, located in the Guest 
House on West Washington Center 
Road, tries to ofTer a vegetarian 
special at all times on its menu and 
can also whip up a fresh vegetable 
and pasta dish upon 
request Eggplant is a 
favorite vegetable of the 
Guest House's chef who is 
very versatile m his 
vegetarian repertoire 
For an extra special 
treat, the chef ree- 
otnmends vegetari- 
ans request a 
special dish 
when ihey 
make their din- 
ner reservation 
to insure he 
has the 
ingredients 
on hand. 

It is easy 
to go vegetarian if you 
go "south of the bwder" 
to Don Pablo's on West 
Coliseum Boulevard. 
Many of the menu 
items are meatless, sucii 
as the bean and ch&amp;ese 
nachos, the spicy cheese dip 
and the vegetable quesadilla. 
New on the menu, and completely 
vegetarian, is the Prairie Fire Bean 
Dip. a combination of spiced 
refried beans, cheese, onions and 
jalapenos, served with fresh flour 
tortillas Don Pablo's also grills up 
a fresh vegetable fajita dinner and 
traditional enchUadas and burritos 
can be made with cheese or beans, 
as can the stuffed chile pepper rel- 
lenos. Anything on Don Pablo's 
menu with beans, either refried or 
charra (a simmered, pinio-style 
bean) is safe eating for vegetarians. 
No lard or meat broths are used in 
the preparation of either style of 
beans Ditto for anything served 
with Don Pablo's Red Sauce, which 
is made from mild red chile pep- 
pers The Red Sauce is meadess. fal 
and cholesterol-free and contains 
only 20 calories per ounce. 
Additionally, the salsas, guacamole 
and flour tortillas are made without 
animal fats or broths. 

Vegetarians can also enjoy a 





wide variety of dishes this summer 
at Bagatelle on West Jefferson 
Boulevard The regular menu fea- 
tures a vegetarian appetizer of a 
roasted sweet potato stuffed with 
goal cheese, topped with roasted 
bell peppen and served with grilled 
French bread Another standard 
menu item is an open-faced Ciarden 
Sandwich, which layers marinated 
ariichokes and bell peppers, toma- 
toes, mushrooms, onions anc 
olives The sandwich is topped 
with Provolone 
cheese i 
popped in the 
oven lo melt the 
cheese 
Bagatelle has a 
.pecial "Summer 
Menu 1997- (hat 
offers an abundance 
of vegetarian appetizers 
and pastas. The chef 
mdicaled that any pasta 
on the regular menu can 
be ordered without meat 
broths used in the prepa- 
ration of the sauces. 
Likewise, salads can 
be ordered meatless. 
The Chinese Noodle 
Salad, the Bistro 
Goat Cheese Salad 
and the Fresh Fruit 
Platter are other 
choices for the veg- 
etarian diner 
Finally vegetarians can 
really sink their teeth into 
Bagatelle's Grilled Portabella 
Mushroom Sandwich which is 
served with roasted bell peppers on 
a French bun 

The Munchie Emporium, on 
Taylor Street, is a great place to 
quell the munchies for vegetarians 
and meal lovers alike. Aldiough 
there are plenty of meat-laden 
ofTerings on the menu, Munchies 
also offers many meadess snacks 
and completely eliminates tbe 
ground beefburger from its menu. 
Vegetarians can look instead at tbe 
"MunchieBurger" menu section 
and choose from 11 varieties 
(Greek. Italian, BBQ, Fiesta, etc.) 
of this vegetarian burger made 
from mushrooms, oats, cheese, 
vegetables and grains. ^ 
Emporium also bakes up a nice 
selection of gourmet pizzas with 
vegetarian toppings and artichoke 
hearts Vegetarians can also design 
their own pasta by choosing a com- 
bination of pasta, sauce and vegeta- 
bles.
