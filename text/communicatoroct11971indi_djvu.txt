dio practicum will be moder- 
ator. Dr. Louis Cantor,

iana University, Fort Wayne

mission; and Rick Frazier, 
Executive Director of Human 
Development and Education 
with the Chamber of Commerce. 

On Oct. 10 "History in 
Fort Wayne, Part I, Abraham 
Lincoln" will emphasize the 
lesser known aspects of 
Abraham Lincoln having human 
interest value. • Roy Hanauer 
and Mary Brant, students in 
the radio practicum will in- 
terview Radio Workshop's 
guest, Dr. Gerald McMurtry, 
director of the Licoln Nat- 
ional life Foundation. 

The Oct. 1711 program will 
be "History in Fort Wayne- 
Pert II-Anthony Wayne" Cele- 
brating Fort Wayne's 17716 
birthday (October 22). Radio 
Workshop will be discussing 
the life of Allen County's 
first citizen, Anthony Wayne. 
Mr. David L. Drury, director 
of the Allen County Fort Wayne

Project Headstart 
to visit campus 

Head Start, a local action 
program designed to prepare 
underprivileged children for 
school, will come to Indiane- 
Purdue next week with the goal 
of involving and informing 
students from this campus of 
their projects. 

Students in Lndiana-Iur- 
due ' s Mental Health Technc- 
logy and Sociology Departments, 
and members of the Student 
Government are already invol- 
ved in Head Start as teacher's 
assistants. These people will 
occupy tables outside of the 
cafeteria on Mondayc and 
Tuesdays to distribute book- 
lets and other information to 
interested p2rsons. 

A rally will be held in the 
Student Lounpe on Wednesday 
at 11:30 a.m. Kepresentatives 
of the Community Action Agen- 
cy will speak. 

The purpose of the three- 
day's activities, according 
to Volunteer Service Coordin- 
ator Cynthia Seoman, is to F^ake 
the university more aware of 
ACEOC and Project Head Start. 
They also hope to recruit 
volunteers, along with persons 
interested in becoming con- 
tacts for the rest of the com- 
munity. 

Head Start is a comprehen- 
sive program developed to 
give preschool children from 
"disadvantaged" homes and 
their families a program of 
education, medical care, soc- 
ial services, and nutrition- 
al .help. 

Project Head Start is a 
branch of the Allen County 
Economic Council, whose pri- 
mary concern is to provide the 
poor in Allen County with an 
opportunity to experience 
the dignity every human be- 
ing deserves.

lems of the physically dis- 
abled will be held on Friday,

Madness has been de- 
scribed in various ways at 
various times , but never 
fully defined. 

They say it can be 
simulated by use of LSD, 
but Dr. Timothy Leary 
left on a trip before 
this could be verified. 

The next best thing is 
to spend Wednesday eve- 
ning in the Communicator 
office . 

Only here can one truly 
learn what madness must be 
invested in order to glean 
a little bit of wisdom from 
the founts of the ball 
points. 

Each week the schedule 
begins with thoroughly 
fatigued people trying to 
get through Thursday clas- 
ses without collapsing. 
They enter this office 
in dread that news will 
occur. 

Friday is the day when 
the newspaper comes out 
and we all gather to read 
it, then spread out to 
determine the reaction. 

Saturday and Sunday 
are spent on homework and 
planning. 

Once Monday rolls a- 
round, the schedule be- 
gins to tighten; pictures 
taken are developed, wri- 
ters are contacted for 
their articles, late 
breaking news is written 
up, and everyone is be- 
ginning to get confused. 
This lasts through Tues- 
day. 

Senate approves 
presidential appointments 



By Wednesday, pandemo- 
nium reigns. Everyone is 
completely confused and 
the office is crowded with 
people trying to get a 
last minute article inclu- 
ded. 

No one in their right 
mind goes within a mile of 
the place by six or seven 
o'clock. The editors' eyes 
bulge and a couple usually 
begin to foam at the mouth 
about this time. 

By about 9 o'clock how- 
ever, things settle down 
to a dull roar. Copy is on 
some pages, other copy is 
located, pictures are de- 
veloped and the mess be- 
gins to take shape. 

"We'll be done by mid- 
night," states a hopeful 
staffer. About 3:00 the 
next morning, we begin to 
realize that we are on 
schedule as usual. 

Soon however, all the 
pages are laid out, the 
pictures are on straight, 
we hope the copy is error 
proof except for the few 
we leave in for those who 
enjoy finding mistakes, 
and we are ready to "put 
it to bed. " 

Dragging home we mumble 
and mutter swearing that it 
is the last time ever, and 
crash for a very short nap 
before classes. Thursday 
passes in a daze of bewil- 
derment as we wonder "why 
bother?'! 

On Friday we find out! 
There is nothing more sat- 
isfying at the moment than 
to see everyone reading 
what we have poured a week's 
worth of our life into. 

But, it is not really 
our life. It iB your life 
we are trying to reflect 
to you, accurately and in- 
terestingly. 

Have a good day. We'll 
tell you about it next week. 



The IU-PU Senate met 
for the 14to time Wednes- 
day at 7=30 in r0 om 178. 

Resolutions regarding 
the free lot parking prob- 
lem and the student coun- 
seling project were re- 
ferred to the Internal 
Affairs Committee. 

Several presidential 
appointments were approved 
by the senate. Marty Mar- 
tinez and Nan O'Connell 
are the Joint Day-Care 
Center appointments. John 
Altevoght was approved as 
a member of the Joint Cal- 
endar Committee. 

Other appointment ap- 



provals are on the Aca- 
demic Affairs Advisory 
Committee for Purdue. They 
are Tom Penzone, Bob Burke, 
Mike Ellis, John Juday, 
George Neireiter, Dan Ri- 
chert, Mike Rothgeb, Ter- 
esa Rothgeb, and Diane 
Schertz. 

It was also announced 
that Roger Nordeen has 
been appointed to the Stu- 
dent Activity Advisory 
Board. 

Sharon Gabet gave a re- 
port on the Convocations 
Committee. The executive 
report concluded the meet- 
ing. 



Being real is 
what disturbs me 

My biggest problem is 
an acute sensitiveness to 
games and the fact that 
all life is a game. I know 
that I can be quite skilled 
in playing it and yet at 
the same time I almost hate 
the games and the people 
and realize that sometimes 
the illusion is perceived 
to be real. 

The being real is what 
disturbs me. Because are 
the games real or simply 
games. And if I look at 
life in only that aspect, 
only I am real because of 
how I react to life and to 
games. I understand Shake- 
speare's "all the world is

The question becomes: 
can I be happier if I'm in- 
volved in the games or to- 
tally disinvolve myself 
from them? I guess it mat-

to express the value of my 
true self, because who will 
really listen.

On-campus parking 



From the President's desk 



by Kark F r anke, Pres- 
-ident of IU-FU Student 
Government 

In light of the recent un- 
fortunate situation that de- 
veloped in the free lot, it 
is of pressing necessity that 
the Student Body be made aware 
of the problems that exist in 
regards to parking on-campus 
and of the proposed solutions 
to these problems. 

On September 7 the City of 
Fort Wayne installed lio Park- 
ing signs alont the road lead- 
ing to the free lot. These 
signs were not placed by the 
campus administration, nor 
were they placed at the re- 
quest of the campus adminis- 
tration. It was feared by 
the Traffic Department that 
continued parking of cars a- 
long the river bank would re- 
sult in permanent erosive 
damage to it. 

After conferring with Dean 
Ulmer and Dean Lantz of Stu- 
dent Services and with Chief 
Warnock of Safety and Secur- 
ity the concensus of opinion 
was that it was ethically un- 
fair for a regulation that 
had not been enforced or over 
one year tc be enforced now 
with no advanced warning. 

After listening to a 
personal plea from Deans Ulmer 
and Lantz and Chief V/arnock, 
Chief Figel of the Fort Uayne 
Folice Department granted the 
campus a four day morator- 
ium to inform the students of 
the new development. As of 
September 20, however, tic- 
kets are beirg issued to 
those who park in the restric- 
ted areas. 

Due to the number of cars 
that could no longer park on 
the river bank, it was soon 
realized that the existing 
gree lot would not suffice. 
A temporary overflow lot was 
established behind the hed- 
ges on the west side of the 
road. 

This lot will not, how- 
ever, withstand the incle- 
ment weather that we must 
suffer in northeastern Ind- 
iana. It was proposed by 
Dean Ulmer to the Joint 
Farking Advisory Committee 
(JFAC) that a permanent lot 
be built to satisfy this need. 
The Committee is witholding 
action until it can be ascer- 
tained exactly how many ad- 
ditional spaces are needed. 
This count will be available 
next week. 

The JFAC has resolved to 



immediately begin formalized 
planning of the parking gar- 
age-like structures to be 
built of the east side of the 
campus. To begin actual con- 
struction, enough cash must 
be on hand to cover the first 
year payments on the bond 
needed to finance the build- 
ing. 

It is estimated that suf- 
ficient funds should be on 
deposit in the Farking Fac- 
ilities Account — the monies 
collected from parking fees 
and fines — by next September 
1. Authorization to build 
must be granted by the Gen- 
eral Assembly. It is hoped 
that this will come yet this 
academic year. 

At a half dozen peak times 
during the day, the intersec- 
tion north of the By-Pass en- 
trance is an insufferable mass 
of cars. To remedy this sit- 
uation, it is proposed that 
a Gtop sign be erected for the 
south-bound traffic. 

This sign should be emplac- 
ed in the very near future. 
This will be for a temporary 
period of time, in order to 
facilitate further study of 
the congestion in that inter- 
section.

WORTHWHILE RALLY 

For students and faculty 

In the student lounge 

Wednesday, October 6th 

At 11:30 a.m. 



October 1, 1971 



Two priests added to 
IU-PU campus ministry 

Canrous Chad a in Dan Mnttn t-.n aaa-i^-t- =+- q+- i n A«. u i n ■*._ 



Campus Chaplain Dan Motto 
announced this week the form- 
ation of a campus ministry 
team comprised of himself and 
two Catholic priests. The 
two are Fathers Don Gillig 
and Larry Kramer. 

They will wor* - with Dan on 
a part-time basis. Their 
principal assignments are to 
St. Andrew's Parish here. 

Father Don, one of three 
brothers serving Fort Wayne 
parishes as priests, will do 
most of his campus work here 
at Regional, while Father 
Larry will try to hit most 
of the commuter-type campus- 
is throughout the diocese of 
Fort Wayne-^outh Bend, cover- 
ing most of northeastern Ind- 
iana. Since our campus is 
the largest of these he will 
spend more of his time here 
than elsewhere. 

Both men have worked with 
young people more or less 
steadily during their pastor- 
al assignments in both the 
Fort Wayne and South Bend 
areas, mainly on the high 
school level but occasional- 
ly with college people as 
well. 

Larry has been visiting 
this campus from time to time 
over the past five years. 
"It's certainly no secret," 
he says, "that the majority 
of college-aged people are 
drifting very loose from any 
direct church influence." 

IIo finds that the usual 
church structures have lit- 
tle appeal to people who 
find themselves floating free 
cf family ties and traditions. 
"The only thing the Churches 
can do for this group," he 
feels, "is make trained rel- 
igious personnel really a- 
vailable to them in their 
own surroundings. What hap- 
pens after thct, if anything, 
is up to them." 

He has watched and admir- 
ed what he calls "the Motto 
Experiment" since Dan first 
began his work here. "Dan's 
availability approach has to 
be the best," he says. "No 
building, no office, no or- 
ganizational encumbrances — 
just people getting to know 
people and going from there." 
How can one man cover more 
than one campus that way? 
Larry sees this as only a 
"temporary problem." Spotted 
here and there throughout the 
territory covered by the lo- 
cal Catholic diocese he sees 
a number of clergymen with 
an appitude for this kind of 
work if they could be intro- 
duced to it on a part-time 
volunteer basis. 

"Don Gillig wasn't origin- 
ally going to be part of the 
plan." he explains. "He was 



to assist at St. Andrew's to 
free me for more of this type 
of work. But it turns out 
that he is very much inter- 
ested in campus work and wel- 
comes the chance to share it." 

Don has spent some time 
in recent years working with 
the students at the IU cam- 
pus in "outh Bend. He adds, 
"I have maintained contacts 
with the students at Notre 
Dame but I enjoyed working 
with the continuing education 
programs at the Extension 
with Doug Smith." 

What does he hope to ac- 
complish at the Extension 
here? "I think just the very 
simple fact that we are pre- 
sent with the students may 
well be our greatest accomp- 
lishment." Don realizes that 
the commuter campus and the 
ministry of the chaplain can- 
not be measured in terms of 
programs or lists of members. 
"We are simply here to bring 
the presence of Christ."

Ivan Bodensteiner, flanked by two members of the 
discussion group which hosted his visit. 

Bodensteiner speaks at IU-PU 



Ivan Bodensteiner, Dir- 
ector of Lep-i'l Services of 
Fort Wayne, Indiana, was at 
the Regional campus last 
'ruesday as featured speak- 
er for a Sociology class 
session dealing with the 
judicial system as it exists 
in the linj.ted States today. 

A discussion group int- 
roduced the program by dis- 
cussing various categories 
of problems such as the 
goals of our laws, the bail 
system, the backlog of 
cases on the dockets, pro- 
cedures involved in bring- 
ing cases to a hearing, 
and the value of a jury. 

After the group pres- 
entation, Bodensteiner 
addressed himself to the 
questions that had been 
raised within each cate- 
gory. The goals of the 
law, he explained, are 
threefold. 

The laws are intended 
for the protection of so- 
ciety, the rehabilitation 
of the criminal if he is 
found guilty, and/or the 
punishment of the crimi- 
nal. 

"Institutions are in 
the majority performing 
the latter/' Bodensteiner 



stated, "to the point that 
penitentiaries have become 
simply holding stations 
for criminals." 

Bodensteiner mentioned 
that Fort Wayne has just 
received funding for a new 
bail program which will 
enable the accused to be 
released until his trial 
date. 

This will entail less 
expenses for the county, 
since the accused can con- 
tinue to support his family, 
and the county does not 
have the expense of his 
maintenance. 

This reduces the drain 
on welfare money which 
would otherwise he needed 
if the accused were incar- 
cerated. 

Various other issues 
were discussed during the 
formal presentation. Dur- 
ing the question and an- 
swer period Bodensteiner 
branched into general so- 
cial problems. 

He emphasized that our 
country has the resources 
to solve the major prob- 
lems facing our society if 
we only readjust some of 
our national priorities. 



Credit Union 
founded here 

After almost a year of hard 
work, poor people in Fort 
Wayne have succeeded in organ- 
izing a poor people's credit 
union. Its official name is 
Allen County Peoples Federal 
Credit Union. The basic idea 
behind the credit union is to 
give low-income residents in 
Allen County the chance to be- 
come more economically inde- 
pendent. 

Through saving together 
and lending to those in need, 
the credit union offers low 
income people the opportun- 
ity to help themselves. The 
credit union also offers the 
more affluent sects of our 
community to make a contri- 
bution. Saving money in the 
credit union provides a 
source of loan capital to 
those who need it. 

Simply, a credit union is 
a group of people with some- 
thing in common who agree 
to save money together and 
lend money to each other 
when needed. It is a coop- 
erative venture run by the 
members as a service to each 
other. 

The charter enables any 
resident of Allen County to 
save money in the credit un- 
ion. Membership fee is 3,25. 
A member may save any amount 
he wishes. The interest rate 
on loans is 1 per cent a 
month on the unpaid balance. 

In the event of death or 
total disability, the loan 
is insured for the balance. 
Each member account is also 
insured up to 320,000 by the 
National Credit Union Admin- 
istration. 

Allen County Peoples Fed- 
eral Credit Union gives poor 
people an excellent opportun- 
ity to help themselves. It 
also provides an excellent 
chance for business, industry, 
and social organizations to 
make a meaningful investment 
in humanity. Anyone willing 
to help may call 742-8431 or 
go to 436 E. Douglas Street. 



Nads demand equal coverage 



by Marty Martinez 

After last week's 
spread on the Beaver's 
flag football team, the 
Nads informed the Communi - 
cator that they, too, 
exist and that all girls' 
football teams should be 
represented. 

Immediately, the Psy- 
chology Club decided to 
test their mettle by chal- 
lenging them to a scrim- 
mage game. 

Since we had no flags, 
we decided to play two 
hands below the belt touch 
football. All the boys 



loved the game but we felt 
sorry for Laune Mason who 
got penalized for illegal 
use of hands. 

Vic Kaminski managed to 
get a personal foul charged 
against the girls team by 
getting his face slapped. 

Holly Shook played a 
great game despite her ob- 
vious handicap. 

Yes, sore male muscles 
proved that the girls do 
play some good football, 
and the Nads confidently 
invite everyone to come 
out and watch them "smear 
the boys."

to help you solve your pro- 
blem. 

The major responsibility 
of t^e Counseling and Test- 
ing Office is to provide con- 
fidential assistance with ed- 
ucational, vocational, per- 
sonal, developmental, and 
social problems. This assis- 
tance comes primarily through 
counseling interviews, the 
use of psychological tests — 
interest inventories, per- 
sonality inventories, ach- 
ievement tests, aptitude 
tests — when appropriate to 
promote student self-under- 
standing, and occupational and 
educational information as 
needed. This office also 
provides remedial assistance 
in helping students to solve 
specific educational pro- 
blems and to remedy academic 
skill deficiencies. 

The Counseling and Testing 
Office, located in Room 106, 
is directed by Dr. Charles 




Dr. Charles Bolyard is 
the newly appointed director 
of the Counseling and Test- 
ing Service. 

Bolyard. To make an appoint- 
ment for a confidential inter- 
view, it is recommended that 
you either call campus ex- 
tension 362 or contact Kiss 
Lynda Geschwell in Room 105. 
For those students who are 
not available during the day- 
time, special evening appoint- 
ments may be made. 



IU-PU Circle K 
accepting girls 

Another male bastion has 
fallen to Women's Lib. The 
IU-FU Circle K chapter is 
now enthusiastically accept- 
ing membership petitions 
from female students. Already 
7 brave women have given their 
names and phone numbers. 

Various projects undertak- 
en are peanut sales (held last 
Friday), WOV/O Penny litch 
Bathtub Pull, acting as sup- 
ervisors at St. Vincents 
Villa and The Fort Wayne 
Cbildrens Home, and of course 
the campus coat check. 

Of course, such a drastic 
change will produce many pro- 
blems for the local club: 
The pin-ups will have to be 
taken down from the coatroom, 
the language will have to be 
improved, and the beer part- 
ies will no longer feature 
cartoons, But says club pres- 
ident James Roehm, "We re- 
fuse to put lace doilies on 
the coat hangers." 

Seriously, the club has 
planned such worthwhile pro- 
jects as a deaf-dumb alpha- 
bet card, a party for a local 
childrens home, a statewide 
leadership training confer- 
ence rnd of course the coat- 
room. 

Anyone interested in join- 
ing should see the call-out 
table outside the cafeteria. 



iu-pu Chess Club | Lebamoff campaigns on campus 




Indiana-Purdue Chess Club 
maets in Room G38, 3:30 every 
Friday. The organization will 
sponsor at least one inter- 
club tournament in addition to 
an all school tournament in 
the spring semester. 

Although chess sets may 
be provided at a later date, 
interested persons are urged 
to bring their own sets to 
the meetings, flost meetings 
will involve maximum play- 
ing time with minimum time 
devoted to business proceed- 
ings. Dues will be fifty 
cents a semester. 

The members are: Ken Long, 
president, Bob Draper, seo.- 
treas.-v. pres. , Reed Romanow- 
ski, Gary Trowbridge, and John 
Simerman. 
October 1, 1971- 



Democratic hopeful for 
Mayor of Ft. Wayne, Ivan 
Lebamoff, visited this cam- 
pus Wednesday to campaign 
for office. 

Lebamoff spent two hours 
shaking hands and talking 
with students here. Host 
of the newly eligible vo- 
ters appeared surprised 
when he approached them. 

Lebamoff said that he 
felt that the reaction to 
him by the 18 year old vo- 
ter is much the same as 
that of the over 21 citizen. 

He noted that most peo- 
ple are surprised to be 
greeted by a candidate. 

Lebamoff stressed the 
importance of the 18-21 
yep~ old vote. 

Toting puts the 18 year 
old in position to make 
some demands, he feels. When 
asked about the Hayes bill 
(featured p. 5, Sept. 25 
Communicator ) , Lebamoff 
said he favored the bill, 
since it emancipates the 
18 year old and makes him 
part of a majority. 

When questioned about the 
problem of drugs in Fort 
Wayne, Lebamoff replied 
that his approach would in- 



clude a strengthening of 
the police department, an 
attempt to find the source, 
more education, and an at- 
tempt to get the youth in- 
volved in finding solutions. 

When confronted with the 
question of money for the 
city, he said that there is 
plenty of money to do what 
the city needs. 

He said such programs 
as Housing Urban Development, 
urban renewal, conserva- 
tion and rehabilitation are 
programs that could be ob- 
tained, if aggresively 
sought. 

Lebamoff also suggested 
a complete restructure of 
tax law so that schools 
will be financed by state 
power of direct tax rather 
than property tax. 

Lebamoff stated* that the 
mayor's office is the most 
persuasive in Fort Wayne 
since he has the -power to 
appoint city officials. 

He said that his pri- 
mary functions as mayor 
would be to unite the com- 
munity, rekindle hope, and 
bring about alternatives 
for improvement. 



Looking at the sports scene - The classifieds 



by Phil Hartman 

The world champion Milwau- 
kee Bucks of the NBA will have 
to defend their title this 
year without fabulous Lew 
Alcindor. Their new center 
is an unknown, Kareem Abdul 
Jabbar. Can you eet to that? 
Don't. Kareem Abdul Jabbar 
is Lew Alcindor. The new 
name was given to Lew three 
years ago upon his conversion 
to the Islamic faith. Accord- 
ing to the Bucks' front office, 
his new 'name will ap, ear on 
the official scorecards and 
all other official tear: publi- 
cations. 

The Islamic religion is 
distinctly different from the 
Black I-.uslir faith -that in- 
spired Cascius Clay to change 
his name to Mohammad Ali. 



Is a hook ball really bet- 
ter than a straight ball in 
• owling? Yes, according to 
ITA star Don Carter. "The 
reason is that a ball that 
is hooking is rolling more 
and therefore has a more de- 
structive effect on the pins." 



The new head coach of the 
Green Bay Packers, Dan Devine, 
made quite s debut in his 
team's opener September 12t. 
He suffered a broken leg in 
a rileup at the Green Bay 
bench after a sideline jlay. 
And to top it off, the Pack 
suffered a weird 42-40 loss 
to the New York Giants who 
were 0-6 in pre-season tilts. 

Don't kiss Washington goad- 
by as a baseball town yet! 
True, controversial owner Bob 
Short is moving his Senators 
to Texas, but the owners of 
the Son Diego Padres are rum- 
ored to be ready to accept 
any reasonable offer to move 



their presently faltering 
franchise to the D.C. city. 
That would likely be a wise 
and profitable shift, because 
Californai is presently over- 
saturated with no less than 
five major league entries. 

San Francisco Giant rook- 
ie Dave Kingman underwent an 
emergency appendectomy Sept. 
1st and was a doubtful per- 
former for the rest of the 
season. But ten days later 
he was back in the lineup! 
If you think that is incred- 
ible, consider the case of 
Kingman's teammate, catcher 
Dick Dietz. Dietz was cut 
down by a pitch Tuesday Sept. 
21st and took ten stiches 
in his head. Three days lat- 
er he was ready to play — 
but couldn't because he was 
unable to fit a batting hel- 
met over the swelling Last 
Saturday the helmet at last 
would painfully fit so he 
could play, and Sunday be 
blasted a grand slam home run 
and drove in five runs in a 
crucial contest with Cincin- 
nati! 

Discouraged Boilermaker 
fans should brighten their 
spirits... at least a little. 
Purdue did succeed in knock- 
ing Notre Dame from the sec- 
ond spot in the nation even 
though they lost the game by 
one point. Also, the 8-7 
shading was far from the 
48-0 blasting the Irish level- 
ed on the Boilermakers last

sports gripe or comment? Let 
it all hang out and send it

TAKE CARE SIORTS FREAKS! 



Flag football season begins 



by Tom Penzone 

Flag football is off and 
vunning this Sunday at Util- 
ities Park and the Beavers 
?nd the Nads (alphabetical 
or-'ier) are convinced that 
they will be leading their 
respective divisions by mid- 
reason. 

Sunday's game schedule o- 
pens the season with the fol- 
lowing teams preparing to do 
battle. 
Division 1 

A vs E at 12:30 North Field 
B vs F at 1:45 North Field 
C vs G at 3:00 North Field 
D vs Beavers at 4:15 North 
Field 

Division 2 

H vs L at 12:30 South Field 
I vs K at 1:45 South Field 
J vs N at 3:00 Sout 1 : Field 
K vs Nads at 4:15 South Field 

The team managers met last 
Friday and few changes were 
cade in the rules. The play- 



ers are permitted to wear soc- 
cer shoes this year and the 
clock will not be stopped for 
infractions, etc. until the 
last two minutes of play. 

Teams are allowed to stop 
the clock at anytime during 
the game by using their two 
allotted time-outs. 

Season champs will be de- 
termined by a play-off among 
the top 4 teams (two teams 
in eech division). 

The university does not 
provide insurance coverage 
so each player must plant 
his right foot and travel at 
his own risk. 

The university does re- 
serve the right however, to 
suspend players who are in- 
volved in fights and other 
displays of outward agression. 

Sorry gals, squirt-guns 
may be labeled overly ag- 
gressive as you might wash 
Daryl Woolem's contact lens 
froff his eye.
