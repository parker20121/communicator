Last Sunday evening, as a pan 
of Dlverjlty Week, United 
Scxualitlci hosted Its first 
Valentine's Dance in Walb 
Ballroom. The llrst hour consisted 
of a drag show where female 
Impersonaion lip synced and 
danced to v-arious t&gt;pei of music.

There ate not a iot of gaj' 
activities for people under 21. 1 
remember when I was younger and 
1 felt isaiatcd, I met people at 
United Sexualities and realized 
that I was not the only one,' said 
AUe Knopf, who attended the 

"For a lot of people who come 
here. It Is their (irsi lime at a drag 
show. Many people don't want to 
go to a gay bar because the)' might 
reel uncomfortable. We view the 
event as both social and educa- 
tional," said Jeff Sterling, chief 
executive officer of United 
Scxuallties. Sterling said many 
people think that all drag queens 

Many people perform as drag 
queens for theatrical reasons. 
Their only pay is gratuit&gt;'. 

Miss Tula, the Seventh 
Wonder of Fort Wa&gt;Tie was the 
opening act and performed 'Over 
the Rainbow' by Patty LaBeilc. 
Tula is on the board oF directors of 
Justice Incorporated, which deals 
with hate crimes and HIV. Tula' is 
also on the board of dlrcciors of 
the Up The Stairs community cen- 
ter, a local ouiit:ach and education 
program, and is the director of 
CAT; Communit&gt;' AIDS Action, 
which provides outreach educa- 
tion and prevention of HIV. Tula 
has been performing for 44 years 
and coordinates the two drag 
shows at After Dark 

"I think this is a great way to 
start Diversit&gt;- Week for the uni- 
versit&gt;'. Drag culture is an impor- 
tant pan of the gay rommunii) 
even though it Is frowned upon b&gt;- 
many, it is vcrj' important for the 
younger generation to know what 
drag is and what is so important 
about it and where it came from," 
said Tula. 

Tula believes that drag is very 
sign meant because drag queens 
were among the first people to 
stand up for gay rights at 
Stonewall, a gaj bar in New York. 
As part of standard operation, the 
police force raided gay bars and 
harassed the performers. Atmoii 
31 years ago, one of the queens 
confronted an officer about the 
harassment and three days of riots 
followed. This was one of the most 
lamous and largest incidents that 
helped create rights for the gay 
communis. Today, this incident 
In gay histori' is simply known as 
Stonewall, 

Speaking of performing, some 
of the other performers who cele- 
brated Diversity Week and enter- 
tained the audience were Mr. Gay 
Indiana, Brad King; Slmune Falls 
from [U Bloomington; Latina 
Garrett, Miss Gay IPFW; Aisha 
Devorc and Trent Black, a drag 
king. Some of the artists thc&gt;- per- 
formed to were Cher, Martina 
McBnde. Jessica Simpson, Brittany 
Spears and Garth Brooks. 

"It look two and a half hour^ 
lo prepare with hair, duct tape and 
make-up. Make-up took the 
longesL I am a natural, so [ don't 
have to practice," said Falls. 

Falls has been performing for 
five years and said that when she 
fint came out. a lot of her friends 
wore Into drag. Falls said that at 
first she thought It was totally 
against the norm, but tried It any 

"1 took a leap of faith, put on 
a dress and had a good time,' said 
Falls. 

This was the first event that 
Garrett had to perform at as pan 
of her duties as Miss Gay IPFW. "1 
think it is great to do this for the 
gay youth of Fori Wayne. Maybe 
we enlightened them a little bit 
and made It easier for them." said 
GarretL

Falling arts 
need a lift 



I am a great supponer or the 
aru, I greaily enjoy going lo the 
theater to kc pl^yt ^nd hear 
mutlirali. 1 love lo go to the art 
mujcum downtown and see the 
cxhiblu. I frequent the Qnema 
Center to sec foreign films and 
independent ninu, 

I tTy to see every poet and 
writer that visits IPFW. Including 
at many Omnibus Lecture Series 
speakers that I can. Among other 
things, I like to spend time at cof- 
fee shops discussing the meaning 
of life, why bad things happen to 
good people, and why professors 
like to assign so much homework. 
I try to soak up as much of life as 
I can. rather than sit in front of a 
TV or computer screen. 

I was excited when I heard 
that the drama department was 
putting on a show of "Arcadia." 
This is a play that 1 was reading 
for a literature interpretation 
class. It Is of the modern genre. 
Modem meaning "of the current 
time,' btit as 1 am learning in my 
Post Modernism class from the 
great Post Modern "Grand 
Wizard," this play may cross the 
lines Into the Post Modem era. 

It's very hard to say because 
we arc living in a Post Modem 
Time. ICs hard to dcTine a time 
while you are liiing in it. But any- 
way, 1 was excited I was going lo 
sec this play acted out before me 
by a group of actors. "Arcadia" Is 
about the chaos theor&gt;'. the differ- 
ences and similarities l)etwecn [he 
19ih and 20th centun', normal 
people, and it's Just a plain tough 
play to understand. Tlieatre is a 
way [o understand a play. 

A play Is obviously meant to 
be staged, but more often than 
not, students Just read plays and 
never get to see them live. This 
was a neat chance to see the play, 
and at the same time to see some 
people that 1 know, on stage, 

I could not sec the play on 
opening night because I had to 
work. I wasn't able to sec the play 
the opening weekend because 1 
had to work. The only chance that 
1 had to see the plaj' was this past 
Saturday nighL I got home from 
work and called my brother who is 
a high school freshman. [ thought 
he might like to go. By this time It 
was 7;45 and the play started at 8. 

There was a traffic Jam at the 
Coliseum because of a hockey 
game or something like that, and 1 
got caught in iL 1 got to my broth- 
er's house at S exactly. We got to 
IPfW at about 8;10-8:1S. 

there was another girl entering 
Williams Tlieatre. We were told 
that If we didn't have a ticket, then 
we couldn't enter. We both needed 
to see this play for class. 1 don't 
know what she had to do, but 1 
had 10 write a review. Well, the 
box ofdcc had Just closed and they 
wouldn't open It up for us. They 
were making their counts for the 
evening. 

1 was a bit upset because 1 
wanted to see the play, and I also 
needed to see the play. 1 could 
understand if the bo\ ofiict- had 
been closed for 10 minutes or so, 
but it had Just closed. I Just want- 
ed to lay my monc&gt;' down and 
walk In. Also, I understand the 
courtesy of theatre. It Is rude to 
enter too late into the play, but we 
would have been extremely quiet. 

I am not complaining about 
not being able to enter without a 
ticket, because I was late. But. if I 
had 3 ticket t would have been 
able to go In. The arts on this cam- 
pus, and the arts in society, arc on 
the downward spiral. 

For some reason our country 
does not put as much emphasis as 
It should on theatre and things of 
the like, and to deny somebody 
the right to participate In an arts 
presentation is quite annoying. 
My question Is this: Is there any 
way that I could see the perform- 

Can 1 have a prl^-aie showing 
or something? Arc the actors put- 
ting on a showing at a later date? I 
know this desire Is probably 
Impossible, but It never hurts to 
try does It7 Besides, I have a few 
bucks that could be Just the thing 
the dnima department may need. 



The truth hurts: Walb just another place in need of more students 




Any college building that has the words this campus is the lack of activity. It Is a

Will they enjoy the outcome of 'The End'? 



by Malissa Fritz, Features Editor 

When I was asked to wTile this 
column for the commentary section of 
the newspaper, I thought to myself. 
how hard can it be to write a column 
on basically anything that I wanted to? 
So, of course, I said yes that 1 would be 
happy to wTite this column. I mean, it 
would be something different to write 

Then I began to start working on 
the column and by the time the end 
came, 1 decided that 1 did not like what 
I had written on the paper. So, 1 tore 
up the paper, threw it away and start- 
ed over with another topic, I worked 
on that topic for about an hour to an 
hour and a half. 1 ended up with the 
same result. 1 read what 1 had written 
on the paper and decided that 1 did 
not like what I wrote this time clther^l 
sat at the table for about 15 minutes. 



completelj at a loss over Ideas to write 

1 realized that this Is not a new 
problem in my academic life. No mat- 
ter what 1 have written in the past or 
will write in time to come, I hardly 
ever completely like what the final 
product Is, No matter how many times 
someone may tell me they like what I 
have written, I'm still not vcr&gt;' happy 
with It myself 

Think about it for a minute. How 
many dmcs have j'ou not been happy 
with the Hnal product, whether It is 
dealing with ivritlng, a project or some 
other kind of work? A majority of us, 
as students, have probably slaved for 
hours and hours over papers at least 
once in our lives and did not like the 
final outcome. -Some times we -are In 
such a hiirry to get it done that we 



have 






c like it 



We always seem to be so worried 
about pleasing others and hoping that 
they like our work that we sometimes 
forget that the hardest person to 
please Is ourselves. Why is that? 
Maybe we are our own harshest critics. 
Or we have been taught for so many 
years to Tmd the problems within our 
work so that we can fix and Improve 
them, that maybe we really have not 
been taught to find the good that is In 
there too. Majbc we are too scared to 
realize that if we did succeed, then 
that Is what is expected from that 
point on and. In turn, we are scared of 
the possibility ol failure. Then agam, it 
could all Just be self-consciousness. 

Hey, these affi jU;( a few possibil- 
ities that I have thought about and I'm 



throwing them out Into the open air. 
Catch them and think about them if 
J'OU want. The)- are free to ever&gt;-one. 
For all I know, I could possibly bi^ way 
off this train track and headed In the 
wrong direction, but maybe I'm noL If 
someone can answer this thoughtful 
dilemma of mine, congratulations! 
Can you let the rest of us know the 
answer please? There may not be an 

those many questions In life that can- 
not be answered. Then again, I might 
be making too much out of this small 
subject matter in life. Who e.tactiy 
knows? 

Well, 1 think that I will end my 
thinking process on this subject right 
there.' It comes back to my question. 
^m^SlP '■Mi final product? No. but 
then again, 1 hardly ever do. 



Sign takes 
away beauty 

The expense ot the new 
electronic sign is directly pro- 
portional to Its offense. It 
destroys my Illusion that culti- 
vated minds seek beauty. One 
thing I've appreciated about the 
Fort W3&gt;Tie campus is the phys- 
ical and architectural land- 

The campus has a symme- 
try, enhanced by the river and 
long lawns, that creates a peace- 
ful, unhurried environment 

Prcviouslj', I've enjoyed m&gt;' 
walk from the parking lot o( 
Gates to Ketiler Hall. Now, my 
sercnlt&gt;' Is assaulted with obtru- 
sive red lights, flashing tjme 
and temperature and a big, 
bold, impenonal "WELCOME." 

I am not opposed to tech- 
nology, but there already exists 
an electronic marquee- 1 PEW'S 
homepage on the Internet. A 
link to campus events could be 
created on the e-mail quick sta- 
tion screens. Televisions, like 
the one In the lobby of CM. 
could broadcast campus events 
Instead of soap operas. 

I may get used to the sign, 
and at 550,000 this folly will 
undoubtedly remain. But 1 v,-ritc 
now to mourn the loss of one 
more pleasant view. To whoever 
suggested and/or approved the 
electronic sign: your iniendons 
are understandable, but the 
placement of the sign Is dis- 
tasteful,

Too much for the children 



by Chadd Pierce, Staff Writer 

les ugly how kids are killing kids, 
That Columbine thing tricked Just about 
ever&gt;' parent in America into thinking 
that ever&gt;' school In America Is a war- 
zone-a land mine Just waiting for a slight 
breeze to sot It off. The crime rate among 
youth is perceived to be at a high num- 
ber by lots of people in this country and 
there are reasons. There are also reasons 
that the younger population Is getting 
more violent to the misunderstanding 
eye. It isn't Just as If all these kids Just 
woke up one morning and decided to go 
lay out the teacher. It's much more in- 
depth than that 

For too many In this nation, the 
recent school violence situations meant 
ground zero for minors. There is no 
going back-we might as well expect them 
to be like the nvelve-year-old guerrilla 
army from Thailand and tr&gt;' to take over 
the country. That's not so, In my opin- 
ion. The tendency of the news to focus 
on the vhorst of 
things isn't 
without reason. 
They do it to get mmm^^^^^^^^^^m 

so if there is only 

one crazy thing right now-and especially 
if that one thing is oh, so perfect for con- 
slant reporting-of course CNN will Jump 
on it like there is nothing else that could 
ever achieve that level of Importance. It 
is Just buslncss-what ihey do. 
Unfortunately, the American public 
tends to be Intelligent, rational thinkers 
by themselves, but in a large group, 
we're Just a bunch of dumb animals In a 
herd, who could be sent Into a raving 
stampede if we found out or saw an)'- 
thing that in our minds could pose a 
threat. We watch TV like if s real-and 
that entertainment thing Is the side 

Well, tap the glass, 'cause there ain't 
nobody In there. 

It's all about Brittany Spears, too. I'll 
give her the fact that she's got 



taleni-and lots of It-but look past the 

dancLig, flipping, and posing and I'm 
not sure how well she can sing. That's 
because it's not her Job. She was hired 
for the main purpose of selling CDs lo 
kids-an untapped market! Mandy 
Moore, Christina Aguilar or Agliear, well, 
you know who I'm talking about-all of 
them: They are a perfect example of a 
good idea taken by others when it works 
for the first. Ever^' song sounds like Ifs 
got twenty back-up singers. It's the Idea 
that they are young, barely legal girls 
who know how to strut their stuff and 
draws millions of fans-male or female. 
The nation Is getting younger, so the 
markets have to start thinking about 
that, too. If the money Is In people IS 
and up, why on earth would a company 
who wants to make money focus on some 
tw e n t&gt;'-e I jjht -year-old who Just bought a 
house and is letding down? There arc a 
huge number 



erlng firewood like they once may 
have-these are responsibilities at which 
those earlier generations would have 
cowered. The funny thing Is that we 
don't focus on the Important stuff. The 
education quality has dropped, while 
superficial requirements have surged. 
It's awful that we train the kids to laugh 
as if they don't know what a mouse docs 
(on a PC), but when It comes to knowing 
how to do their taxes, many couldn't 
care less. It's stereotypes and neglect. I 
can't excuse the prctO' recent shootings, 
beatings and other violence, but I am 
saying that there is a major abandon- 
ment problem here. 

When it comes to the children buy- 
ing our products -that's line, but when 
llttie Bobby wants a hug from Daddy, 
there is not enough time in the day. 
We're messing up somehow. We consider

them in unknown territory. Of

many choir iiudenu are most 
excited about New York Cl[&gt;' 
ahd Washington D.C. 

According to Wiiiiam 
Skoog, director and conductor 
of choir and assistant profes-

things that happen when you 
go on tour like ihis. FInt, the 
music reaches a nciv level, ai if 
a Ore had been placed beneath 
a beaker and cooked for seven 
days,' said Skoog. "Second, 
you get the word out. You put 
IPFW on Ihe map. If you are 
attending a school locally, 
such as Soulli Side High 
School, are you likely to attend 
IPFW because we came to your

Two busloads of IPFVVs

The California punk outfit 
Goldfinger is back with a 
vengeance. Goldfinger, whose 
number one alternative single 
"Here In Your Bedroom- 
gained them popularil&gt;' among 
mainstream and alternative 
audiences. Is back with their 
third release "Stomping 
Ground." 

"Stomping Ground- 
brings Goldfinger lo a leiel 
that their second album 
"Hang-Ups" did not achieve. 
The album features songs that 
may help the band appeal to 
mass audiences and generate 
new fans of the band, but also 
contains songs thai will not 
disappoint long-ume fans of 
Goldfinger. 

-Counting the Days," the 
first single off of the album. Is 
a poppy-punk song that will 
generate the band some 
commercial radio airplay and 
earn Ihe band more credibility 
in the mainstream marlict. 
'Counting the Days" Is a great 
song that will bring people 
who would not normally listen 
to Goldfinger to the band. 

Long-time Goldfinger fans 



will be impressed with the 
album also. Songs like "I'm 
Down," "Cany On" and -You 
Think It's a Joke" will maintain 
the band's credibility with 
their loyal fan base. The album 
also contains a cover of Nina's 
"99 Red Balloons- which does 
the original justice. It is a ver- 
sion that stays true to the orig- 
'-"' while punking It up to a 

Goldfingi 

Ground," proves to be a great 
album that has not left my CD 
player since 1 received my 
copy. This album will be 
released March 28 and is 
worth purchasing. 

Goldfinger is currentiy on 
tour in Europe with the 
Bloodhound Gang, but will be 
returning to the U.S. In March.

Women's basketball team sets sights on conference tournament 



by Brian Miller, 
Guest Writer 



The IPFWwomen-i baskei- 
ball (cam haj been cnjojing 
lome of lu ben basketball 
ilnce 1995-96 and has the con- 
ference tournament on its 

TTie Dons rattled off an 
Impressive four-game confer- 
ence win streak, something an 
IFFW women's basketball team 
has failed to due since the days 
Of Undy Jones, 

The team, which Is cur- 
rently 12-12 (8-10 In the 
GLVC). has a chance lo Hnish 
the season with a winning 
record with a pair of victories 
against UM-Si. Louis and 
QMlncy lonlght and Saturday. 

One thing that this team 
has been able lo say Is that 
there has been a point in each 
of [heir 12 losses where they 
had a chance to at least make a 
comeback, losing S games by 
five points or less. 

The four-game winning 
streak came after a shilackJng 
at SIU-ndwards\lllc where the 



team lost by 25 points, their 
worst loss of the season. 

Riding that four-game 
winning streak Into this week- 
end, the team went to face 
Indianapolis. 

The Greyhounds, who out- 
slied the Dons in their previ- 
ous meeting, did just that In 
this meedng as well. Howe\'cr, 
the Dons did force overtime 
and were outscored 93-90 
after the extra session. 

Jamie Holderman scored a 
game high 27 points, after 
scoring 12 the previous game. 

Guards Kara Moore and 
Shante Smith had 22 points 
and 19 points respectively, a 
career high for Smith. 

Trish Fleming recorded 13 
points and 11 boards as the 
Dons lost yet another close 
game In the final minute. 

Saturday wasn't any easi- 
er for the team as they squared 
ofT against the toughest team 
in the conference, the 
Northern Kentucky Norse. 

The Norse entered the 
game 16-1 In conference play

IPFW matched NKU 
baskei-bybasket and only 
trailed 40-37 after the half. 

That left the coaching 
staff and the players feeling 
pretty good, seeing that IPFW 
has baiUed back and put them* 
selves in a situation to win all 
throughout this j-ear. 

However, this game would 
be an exception to the norm. 
IPFW came out flat and 
rctnained that way. shooting a 
miserable 15.4 percent from 
the field and scoring only 12 
second half points-thelr low- 
est single-hair productivltj' the 
whole season. 

One thing that also 
plagued the Dons were 
turnovers, something Coach 
Smesko has always prided his 
team on. The team committed

That victory really posi- 
tioned the Dons nicel)- as 
Indianapolis, Beilarmine. SlU- 
Edwardsville and UM-Si, Louis 
all lost that same night. 

However. Coach Noll knew 
that his team would need to 
win one of its next two road 
games if they were going to be 
able 10 breathe comfortably. 

Thursday, the team trav- 
eled again-thls time 10 
Nlcoson Hall to face the 
Indianapolis Crreyhounds, a 
team that beat them 91-79 at 
the Gates Sports Center less 
than one month ago. 

Indianapolis, much like 
IPFW, enjoys the fast-paced, 
run and gun style. It would be 
a battle of execution between 
the it\o schools. IPFW came out 
anil scored 47 points in the 
Hrst half, but team defense 
wasn't there and the 
Greyhounds scorched the 
Dons for 61 points in the first 
hair alone. 

IPFW entered the second 
half down by 14. a deficit 
which is tough to come back 
from in this conference. 

Again. IPFW shot the ball 
well, but trading baskets with 
the Grey hounds didn't help as 
the team lost 98-85. 

Indianapolis had quite 
possibly one of its best games, 
shooting an astounding 57 
percent from the field and S3 
percent from behind the arc. 

ScniorSteve GriCTm scored 
30 points in the contest, con- 
necting on si.x 3-polnt baskets. 

That night, Beilarmine 
beat SlU-Edwardsiillc in over- 
time to pull oven (vilh the Dons 
[at 7-10 in the conference) to 



in the conference lourna- 

Saturday would mark the 
last road game of the regular 
season and the Dons wanted 
to upset Northern Kentucky. 

NKU. ranked tenth in the 
nation (according to the 
NABC/'Division II poll), had 
only suffered a few losses all 
year in conference play. 

The Dons played well in 
front of 1,822 screaming NKU 
fans, leading 34-30 at the 
half. The first half was low 
scoring, which the Dons 

IPFW had NKU on (he 
ropes, leading 47-40 In the 
secpnd half, but the Norse 
were too much as the) rallied 
back (o stay undefeated ai 
home this year, winning 68- 
63. 

Akanni led the Dons in 
scoring with 20 points and 
CiifTin added 15. 

Thanks to a Beilarmine 
loss, the Dons are currently 
tied for seventh place and 
need to win both games, to 
assure a spot In the GLVC con- 
ference tournament. 

The Dons host the 
University of Missouri-St. 
Louis tonight at 7:30 p.m. and 
Quincy University Saturday, 
Feb. 26, at 3 p.m. That will be 
Senior Day for the team's six
