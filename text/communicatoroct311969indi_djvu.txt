T'.t Jj ::v-:j.-;,v:jr 1969-7* 



Mi, Etalpli TowDley, a memlMr 
of the United Nations for 19 years 
from England, was the speaker 
presented by the Flret Estate 
on Monday, October 27. Start- 
In g out as a ^leclal Assistant 
to the AaslEtant Secretary Gen- 
eral at Economic Attalrs, Mr. 
TowDley baa moved up to the 
Uolted Nations Development Pro- 
gram. 

Opening the discussion with 
the topic ol Human Rights, Mr. 
Toivn3ey spoke of Che UN's Dec- 
laration on Human Bights. These 
rights are put Into two cate- 
goTles: 1) social and economic 
rights, and 2) legal and politi- 
cal rights. 



In 194B, the General Assembly 
decided to make a declaration 
ot human rights which was to 
be used as a yardstick to mea- 
sure the progress ol interna- 
tional society. Later, when the 
General Assembly met, mea- 
sures were taken to convert this 
yardstick Into International law. 

The Declarations ware made Into 
treaties. One treaty concerns 
legal rights and the other social 
rights. 

Another topic undertaken by 
Mr. Townley was urban pres- 
sures. Mr. Townley slated, 
"Centers decay and die", when 
asked what Fort Wayne was do- 



i&gt; ^ r. ^-fi ■? '. 



THE 



COMM 







ing with its downtown area he 
was Informed that a parking lot 
was being built. Mr. Townley 
talked ot England and their ex- 
perience with building new cities. 
One of the main Ideas for build- 
ing a new city Is to bring the 
work to the worker Instead of 
taking the worker to work. 

In regards to foreign policy, 
Mr, Townley felt that the Ameri- 
cans definitely believe In the 
doctrine of finality; meaning that 
Uie U.S. would do anything Just 
so the problem could be solved. 
He stated the Americans felt a 
need to have a foreign policy 
to end all foreign policies.

Freshman enrolment patterns shown 



BLOOMINGTON, Ind. - - 
Sevenly-elght per cent of the 
treshmen in Indiana Institutions 
of higher learning last year were 
residents ot Indiana; 21 per cent 
came from other stales, and one 
per cent came tromtoreign coun- 
tries, a stale-wide survey shows. 

Freshman enrollment pat- 
terns Id Che state are shown In 
a repDrt just released by the 
Regional Campus Coordinating 
Committee (R.CC.Oof the pub- 
lic Universities, The study was 
made in cooperation with the 
Indiana Conference (or Hl^er 
Education, 

Thomas M. Elliott, an Indi- 
ana University graduate student 
and a research associate tor 
R.C.C.C., explains the survey; 

"The Bgures are based on a 
91. S per cent response from 
50, 0B3 freshmen on48 campuses 
of the 36 public and private 
Inslltutlons studied. A compari- 
son with a similar study made 
In 1960 shows some significant 
changes in enrollment patterns. 

"The proportion of in-state 
freshmen enrolled at private In- 
diana Institutions was down 10 
per cent from Che 1960 figure. 
The proportion of Indiana resi- 
dent freshmen enrolled at re- 
gional campuses □( the public 
universities was up B per cent, 

Student Union 



while main campuses ot the pub- 
lic InsCItutlons Increased their 
share of the total freshman en- 
rollment by 2 per cant." 

The Information comes from 
questionnaires given to freshmen 
who enrolled at Indiana prlvale 
and public Institutions of higher 
education at the beginning of Che 
1969-69 school year. It was pro- 
cessed at the Indiana University 
Research Computing Center 

The 3.J private Institutions ot 
higher education In Indiana last 
year enrolled EGper cent (13,163) 
of the (oCal freshman crop In the 
state, with 44 per cent being 
residents of Indiana and 56 per 
cent non-residents. 

The public InstlCulIonenrolIed 
36,920 freshmen. OlChlsnumber, 
22,991 attended the five main 
campuses and 13,929 attended 
regional campuses, Elghty-slx 



per I 



t of C 



I fresh 






attended main campuses were 
Indiana residents while 96 per 
cenC of Che freshmen at regional 



Private 

diana, the study shows, enrolled 
about two-thirds of the 11,135 
non-resident freshmen last year. 
The remainder otthe out-of-state 
freshmen were enrolled atpubllc 
Institutions, 



Shore building planning 



A questionnaire isbelng mail- 
ed to all credit students at Ibe 
Fort Wayne campus from the 
committee planning the Student 
Union Building, It was announced 
by AsEl. Dean R.J, Manges. 

The purpose of the questlon- 
nafre Is to evaluate the Import- 
ance each Individual assigns Co 
various types of Jacllltles. The 
results will be used to assist the 
committee In determining prior- 
ities of facilities. 

Return bones will be located 
Id the library, cafeteria, Office 



of audent Services, and informa- 
tion area. 

Manges further added that it 
is important to get "as much 
informallon as we can from the 
students", as It will be "costing 
tbem 4 mlUlon dollars". 

Future plans for the com- 
mittee Include a look at what 
was described as one ot the 
"finest student union bulldlngsln 
the country", located on the 
Rochester campus In Oakland, 
tn Institution similar In size 
to this campus with an enroll- 
ment ot 6,000 students. 



There were twlca as many 
Indiana freshmen dl.SlS) goinc 
out ot state to school than fresh- 
men from outside the state 
(3,B03) who enrolled In slate 
Institutions In Indian?. The num- 
ber of out-of-state resldentswho 
enrolled as freshmen In private 
Instltullons In Indiana totaled 
7,332. 

In 1960, the percentage of 
Indiana high school graduates 
who enrolled In college was S4 
per cent. By 1968, the percent- 
age had Increased to 66 per 

More high school graduates 
are coming back Co school after 
working a few years. In 1968, 
the study shows 14 per cent of 
Che Indiana freshmen enrolling in 
colleges In Indiana had graduated 
from high school more than five 
years earlier, In]9S0, thisflgure 
was about 9 per cent. 

The 1968 Increase coincides 
with a growth In freshman en- 
rollment at regional campuses 
where students often delay their 
education while working to earn 
money for tuition andother costs. 

The largest single block of 
In-staCe freshmen enrolling In 
public Inst ituc Ions last year was 
at Indiana University's regional 
campuses^ This group comprised 
25 per cent of total enrollment 
In this category. Neict was l.U.'s 
Bloomlngtoo campus with 16 per 
cent of the total. 

Other state schools and (hefr 
percentage of Indiana freshmen 
last year are: Ball staCe, 15,2; 
Purdue, 12.5; Purdue regional 
campuses, 11,5; Indiana State, 
11.4; Vtncennes, 4.7; Indiana 
State University , Evansvllle 
campus, 1.9, and Eastern Indiana 
Center, Richmond, 1.7. 

The average regional campus 
in the slate enrolled 67 per 
cant ot Its freshmen from the 
Bounty In which it was sitilated. 
AjMther 18 per cent was enrolled 
from contlglous counties. Indi- 
ana's private Institutions drew 
21 per cent of thefr freshmen

wouldn't let her. She was unhappy for about a day, but sbe

Editorial 



If criticism can be found with Fort 
Wayne, it's that its people rarely seek 
it. They keep quiet, don't ask questions, 
remaining in the same modes of thought 
laid in wagon ruts of years past, 
* This is the city of the solid respect- 
able citizen. He's for the most part 
conservative, both in action and imagina- 
tion. What was good for &amp;ther is good 
for son. The Institutions must be pre-* 
served as change is questionable. 

Preserved they are, like fbssils; the 
old values, the old ideas, fitting the 
times like square pegs in round holes. 

One of the aspects of this quiet serene 
city that likes to picture itself enclosed 
around a log stockade Is the reflected 
attitude in students on this campus. They, 
the products of a city stagnated by thought 
built around illusions of "safety", "se- 
curity" and "Law and Order" have been 
molded well to the forms of complacency 
and apathy. 

Involvement Is an empty word, void 
of meaning at the regional campus, which 
Eierhaps is well suited to be renamed 
the "house of cards",

Letters 
to the editor 



Mr. Editor: 

Id response to the letter t&gt;y 
Mary Elizabeth Aksamiianlput&gt;&gt; 
ilshed October 20, 1969, coa- 
cerolng the leadership retreat 
let me give the following answer. 

Mary has taken several very 
strong points, points which we 
In Student Government spent a 
long time thinking about, such 
as; 

1) Picking students at fresh- 
man orleiiatlon by a (luasilon- 
naire based od High School ac- 
tivities Is unfair, 

2) Every student should be 
given a chance to tie selected. 

3) There are "leadership 
late-bloomers.'' 

4) Some students do give up 
extra - currlcular activities in 
high school. 

5) Every student should lie 
able to participate. 

My responses to these points 

1) There are 1,700 members 
of the freshman class. There 
ore about 34 members of Student 
Government. Simple math will 
tell us that each member of gov- 
ernment would have to Interview 
50 treshmenl 

We In Student Government de- 
cided ttiat if a person couldn't 
have found time to attend the 
orientation they also wouldn't be 
able (0 (a) attend the leader- 
ship retreat, and (b) find the time 
to work in Student Government. 

Therefore, we felt that select- 



ing the freshmen from the five 
orientation sections would help 
limit the group. 

Orientation was the first time 
we would meet the freshmen and 
would also be the last tliue be- 
fore the retreat, scheduled the 
weekend before school started. 
Why have the retreat so early? 
Apathy has a strong following at 
this campus and In order to 
praveni everyone from catching 
it we must first inflict people 
with empathy. 

Even after we had limited the 
freshmen to the orientation group 
we found that we hadl,lSDfresb- 
men. The t&gt;est way to conduct 
the interviews was to bring In- 
to the office two freshmen at 
a time to talk to the selection 
committee, (At first we talked 
about having one person from 
the selection committee talk to 
one freshman but we realized 
that the committeeman could not 
relate to his fellow committee- 
men another person's feelings. 
Also one Interviewer might say 
a person should go while an- 
other would say they shouldn't.) 

Even if we gave each of the 
I.ISO people a 10 minute inter- 
view one can see how time con- 
sumliDg this would be. 

2) Every student was given a 
chance to l&gt;e selected, (a) They 
Orst had to show enough interest 
to coma to orientation, (b) They 
had to have some qualifications 
from high school, and (c) They 
had to go through the Interview. 

3) There Is such a thing as 
a "leadership late -bloomer," I 
myself am one (I didn't go on 
the leadership retreat myself 
In my freshman year.) However, 
the leadership retreat is not to 
train leaders but to take people

has already happened yesterday. We will appreciate your help. 

k conservofive esfimofe 



The moratorium for October 
Is over, Everyone that took part 
Is reasonably happy. The lead- 
ers of the opposing groups, 
S.A.M. and I.S.U, get Logether 
in the student government of- 
fice and discuss thalr various 
strategies and delate over who 
achieved the greatest amount of 

The moratorium sounds very 
Innocent. K seems that a bunch 
of people got together, organized, 
and had a good time. But, is 
the moratorium so innocent? Do 
you realize tliat by the month 
of April the national leaders of 
the moratorium committee wUl 
be calling for a seven day nation- 
wide strike? If eoougb people co- 
operate this could mean a Shut- 
down of the uoiversltlae and a 



virtual standstill In the business 

So whati We couid all use a 
week's vacation. Now could this 
hurt the country? What do you 
ttiink these people will be do- 
ing during this seven day strike? 
TheyU t&gt;e sittting around wait- 
ing for someone to light the tire. 
It would be a tailor-made sit- 
uation for Eomeooe to step In 
and call tor a popular people's 
movement to bring about Instant 
change in the present (so called) 
unre^MQSlve democratic pro- 
cess. REVOLUTION! 

NOT in the great U.S., 
It COULDK'T happen here, 
It's ALMOST impossible, 
I HOPE we have notbing to 



One of the major reasons 
behlxxl the general "blahoess" 
of the student body Is the lack 
of pride in our university. Stu- 
dents frequently refer to our 
campus asBy-PassHlghor Jotm- 
ny Apple seed Tech. Getter ally 
this attitude results from the 
apathy of the student. He freely 
crltlclzas hut does nothing to 
get Involved, nor does he lift 
one finger to help build the pres- 
tige of our university. 

We in student governmentrun 
headlong Into this attitude nearly 
every day. Most students don't 
have the guts to say "I care" 
and do something alxiut it. The 
elected student government, the 
voice of the students, has a weak 
bargaining position when student 
interest Is negligible, it the stu- 
dents don't care, no one will listen 
to them. 

Here at Indiana- Purdue we do 
have a campus of which to \» 
proud. About f28,o00 a year goes 
to athletics. Student government 
allocates alxiut ^7, QOOof student 
activity fees a year. Our student 



government thus has more con- 
trol than most. 

Our university has about 4900 
ftill-tlnm students. Some 11,000 
people take classes at our camp- 
us. Only Indiana, Purdue, Indiana 
State, aiid Ball State have mors 
registered students. 

Indiana- Purdue at Fort Wayne 



s the recognized c 



rof si 



dent political activity In north- 
eastern Indiana. Our social pro- 
grams are exceptional for a re- 
gional campus. The other 
organizations here are incom- 
parable to other regional camp- 

Our athletic programs, both 
varsity and Intramiural, are ei:- 
tenslve. Our student government 
Is an active one with consider- 
able Influence. 

Our campus, Indiana- Purdue 
at Fort Wayne, is what you make 
It. It's not a stopover between 
high school and tlie main campus. 
It Is a university, with the ac- 
tivities and attractions of a uni- 
versity. Be proud of It, defend 
It, and above all, get active 
and help make it even better.

who have the skills and get ttiem 
into the stream of leadership at 
this campus. 

4) Some students who didn't 
do anything In high school do 
t&gt;ecome leaders; however, that 
per centage is small, once a- 
galD the goal of the leadership 
retreat Is to get leaders Into 
the system not train them, 

5) If every student were to 
participate the cost would be 
so great that It couldn't take 
place. There would be the cost 
of more places to stay, more 
transportation, and more food. 

If every student were to par- 
ticipate It would lose a lot of 
support of the freshmen because 
it would lose the prestige which 
It has. 

Finally, U every freshman 
were to participate the groups 
would be so large that the strong 
friendship ties which helps the 
freshman become a leader could 
not be formed. 

In summary I would say that 
if anyone has a better way of 
doing this or anything else bring 
your Idea to Student Government 
In Room 104.

I feel that it is necessary 
to reply to Inane statements of 
the so called "responslblerlght" 
on our campus - Young Ameri- 
cans for Freedom (YAF). Al- 
though they deny It, Victory in 
Vietnam CVIV) Students against 
the Moratorium (SAM) are no- 
thing but front organisations for 
YAF. Don Sluckey, head of VIV, 
and Mark Souder, head of SAM, 
and dear old Re)i Teeple are all 
big boys In the YAF organia- 
tlon. Furthermore, YAF money 
was used to fly In Dr. Lob at 
great expense trom New York; 
and YAF money was used to 
publish the pretty (but highly 
inaccurate) SAM pamphlets. So 
let us bury the myth that there 
is no connection ttetween YAF 
and these other groups. 

It is now time to examine this 
business of SAM's late start. 
At the most, there was not more 
than a 3C hour difference from 
the time BU formed and YAP'S 
reaction. And it was an Interest- 
ing reaction. 

I've heard so much atwut the 
"responsible right' - what a 
joke. On October 13th, Stuckey 
called us "atheists, agnosUcs, 
and unamericao." On Tuesday, 
according to Souder, we were 
"radicals" and "communist 
dupes". The hogwash was un- 
believable. And just who was 
making these statements? 

Ffrst, there was Qon Stuckey. 
Don admits to t)eing a member 
Of the "Mlnutemen" an organi- 
zation thatvergesonoutrightfas- 
clsm. This par a- military organi- 
zation has been branded a sub- 
versive organization by J, Edgar 
Hoover of the FBI. Mark soudar 
is a conclentous objector. Yet he 
can justify sending others to 
tight and die In a war which he 
will not serve In for religious 
beliefs. I've discussed this mat- 
ter with him and have yet to 
receive an adequate answer. The 
paradoxes pile up on another, but 
I believe I have supplied enough 
examples of the "responsible 
right" on this campus for one

Rare book collection for campus

Well, Uianks to BUI Hart and Iris LsUiar 
Sylvia Bowman, our Fort Wayne Sampta on I 
campus Is developing a rare 

books colledlon. A publlcrecep- BUI Han, the I.i;. Public Re- 
tlon on November 2 was held latlons man, has donated steel 
to display materials now avail- engravings of "Stars of iha 
able lor research. The faculty stage" Irom 1875 Including Ed- 
wlves and a string quartet pro- win Booth and Sarah Bernliarl. 
vlded tiackgroiind (or (he display Also donated are IQtb century 
of materials donated. Good re- histories, encyclopedias, tracts 
sponse has come (orth from our on "the evils ol liquor", and the 
community. The appeal for bis- iSiS London Times (concernli^g 
torlcal t&gt;ooks, letters, diaries, Napoleon), 
and pamphlets has generated In- Dr. Bowman has donaledtlrst 
teres! throughout the area. Dr. editions of Carl Sandburg and 
Bowman has appeared on the Edward Bellamy, rare editions 



of George Sands' work, and let- 
ters from Sandburg, John Dos 
Passos, and Upton Sinclair. 

It Is hoped that a proper 
room win be allocated for these 
valuable Items In our new li- 
brary. We now possess, for ex- 
ample, a first edition of thebm- 
ous dlctlonaryof SamueUohnson. 
In the future, a memory bank of 
taped recollections might be a- 
vallable tor study and research. 
Wa owe Mr, Hart and Dr. Bow- 
man our encouragemBnl for their 
genesis of this project. 



When tuition fees were hiked 
from approximately $400 tonear- 
ly fflOO per year last spring 
by the state legislature, students 
began to find that financial aid 
was hard to come by. 

The fee Increase Is at least 
partially re^mnslble for the 
dropoff In enrollment trorn the 
projected figures of last spring. 
Of those who did enroll, more 
students qualified for financial 
aid which Is based almost en- 
tirely on need. 

Any application for financial 
aid would be handled as a part 
of the total "family" of main 
and regional campuses of liotb 
Indiana and Purdue Universities. 

Since last spring applications 
for all kirals' of financial aid have 
markedly Increased Ihroughout 
the state. Student loan applica- 
tions have nearly doubled. Work- 
study program applications have 
mounted almost proportionately. 

The last of the financial a- 
wards from Indiana University 



were made as early as July 
and August of last summer, ac- 
cordl[« to Mr, William Chavis, 
Coordinator of Financial Aid and 
Placement, Purdue was In the 
same boat. 

As a result, the banks In the 
area have felt the effect and have 
consetiuently lieen forced to 
tighten their requirements for 
acquiring loans, A minimum of 
$500 to a maximum of $1500 
cover the range of amounts that 
would be loaned to students by 
many of the banks In the area. 
Four to six weeks are required 
to process loans through the 
Federal Insured Loan Program, 
It appears to be far easier for 
a business or a homeowner to 
obtain loans tor building expan- 
shin or for mortgages than for 
a college student to get a much 
smaller loan to pay for his lul- 

Isn'l It strange that, here In' 
the land of equal opportunity, 
the cflllege student Is the last 
to reap any of the benefits?

An estimated 16 per cent of 
Indiana freshmen enrolled at 
schools outside Indiana In 19CB, 
There Is no ehanne from the 1960 
figure. Both estimates are based 
on studies made In lOSB and 1963 
of Indiana freshmen enrollment

Counties having at least one 
city with a population of 10,000 
or more are classified as urban 
In the study. Alt others are 
designated rural counties. Urban 
counties were found to have a 
considerably higher rate of 
freshman enrollment than rural

A recorded message 



Historian's point of view 



by Steve 

About 9:30 a,m, on October 
IE, I got Into a lather heated 
argument with a fellow student 
concerning the moratorium, 1 
didn't know his name, but he 
was wearing jeans, a letter jack- 
et from high school and a sock 
hat. But the most salient feature 
of his make-up as 1 remember 
him standing in the lounge was 
the large decal of the American 
flag that he had pasted on one 
of hlB liooKs, 1 attempted to dis- 
cuss the Vietnam situation, but 
he closed bis miod, began call- 
ing me a "commie" and other 
assorted (but not necessarily re- 
lated names. The result was that 
I liegan to raise my voice, then 
decided that It wasn't worth the 
effort and walked away. 

What was shocking about this 
fellow was that he simply did- 
n't know what he was talking 
about. His study of the Vietnam 
situation had not progressed be- 
yond the Journal-Gazette's front 
page. As the day wore on, I 
found a shocking lack of basic 
knowledge of the Vietnam crisis 
displayed by a number of people, 
in view of where we are (a 
college) and the Issue (the most 
Important crisis of our ganara- 
tlon), I find it indefensible for 
any college student not to have 
done some background readingon 
the situation. 

One can find mora than 30 
volumes in our library directly 
relating to the Vietnam crisis. 
Among them are Bernad Fall's 
works: Hell In a Very Small 
place; The Battle of DIemblen- 
phu; Street Without Joy; Vietnam 
Witness; and Last ReQectlons on 
a War. 

Fall Is considered the best 
scholar on vietnamand his works 



Pettyiohn 

have been atrophying on our li- 
brary shelves. The Battle of 
DIemblenphu waswrlttenby Jules 
Roy in 1961, Roy, a former 
French army officer, visited 
North Vietnam in 19G1 and has 
some interesting observations on 
America's Involvement, We have 
two books by North Vletnameese 
leaders: Ho Chi Minh's On Rev- 
olution; Vo Nguyen Clap's, pres- 
ent Defense Minister and victor 
at DIenblenphu, People's War 
People's Army, For the impact 
of French colonialism In Indo- 
china, read Virginia Thompson's 
French Indo-Cblna, General (re- 
tired) S,L,A. Marshall's Battles 
In the Monsoon Is an account of 
U. S. - North VIetnameese bat- 
tles in 1066, These books are 
just a few ol the two shelves 
in our library full of books on 
Vietnam. 

One book that Is mustreadlng 
for any one who Is attempting 
to understand the phenomenon 
of modern querllla warfare is 
Guerilla by Charles W, Thayer. 
Mr, Thayer Is a graduate ot 
West Point, an ex-cavalaryman, 
B veteran of service with Tito's 
partlslns In Yugoslavia during 
World war n, and a career di- 
plomat, Mr, Thayer has been 
studying Guerrilla warfare for 
the last 25 years,* His Guer- 
rilla Is 200 pages or solid in- 
fer nation on the various aspects 
of guerrilla warfare and count- 
er 'insurgency action. 

As college students, we owe 
11 to ourselves and our com- 
munity to do some serious think- 
ing and research on the Viet- 
nam situation. It is not enough 
to engage in name calling and 
senseless diatribes: one must do 
some thinking. 



Early this summer talk 
spread of the possibility of an 
informal group consisting of 
David Crosby, Steve Stills, and 
Graham Nash, three of the most 
talented of older, well-known 
bands. Crosby - one of the orig- 
inal Byrds, Stills - from the 
defunct Buffalo Springfield, and 
Nash - the Hollies' soprano and 
lead singer, had long admired 
each other's work and Dnally did 
get together for a session In 
Jonl Mitchell's California living 
room. later, their first album, 
Crosby, StUls, &amp; »ash, was re- 
in Crosby, Stills, £ Nash 
(Atlantic), the dominant forces 
ot once-prominent groups Join 
to put together a unique and 
welcome sound. The album Isn't 
heavy In the sense ot wah-wahs 
and fuzz- it wasn't intended to 
he. The acoustic guitar Is prev- 
alent although there are some 
tingling sounds mingled through- 
out. The music has the electric- 
ity of the Byrds, the country 
charm of the Buffalo Springfield, 
and the soaring harmony of the 
Hollies. Together, these ingred- 
ients produce one of the better 
and more original sounds ot the 
year. 

The songs, written by each 
of the three, range from the 
Marrakesh Eqiress line to more 
serious melodies and sometimes 
slower tempos. The dominant 
aspect Is Nash's near falselto 
and it Is hard to Imagine the 
album wlthoutlt, although It might 
be a bit overused. 

The lyrics vary from simple 
love songs (Suite Judy Blue Elyes,' 
Lady of the Island) to political 
messages on atomlcwar (Wooden 
Ships) and society's problems 
(Long Time Gone) to the theme 
of happiness in "Marrakesh Ex- 

The musical ability of Cros- 
by, Nash, drummer Dallas Tay- 
lor, and especially that of Stills, 



who plays most or all ot the in- 
strumental backing on several 
tracts, make this record some- 
thing special. It's great harmony 
and comparatively easy listening 
from one of the original super- 
groups, 

Wliat is 
first estate? 

The First Estate Is a non- 
partisan political science group 
that attempts to make a greater 
political awareness In the stu- 
dent body. It hopes to achieve 
its goals by sponsoring speakers, 
discussion groups, and debates 
on topical matters. 

The active group has already 
sponsored two programs this 
year, one campus involvement 
and the student protest move- 
ment and the other on the 
United Nations, First Estate also 
plans to sponsor a delegation to 
the Mld-Amerlcan Model United 
Nations (WAMUN) at BloonUng- 
ton. Last year, First Estate dele- 
gates succeeded Ingettinganum- 
ber ot their resolutions passed 
at MAMUN. 

During the past three years 
FlTsl Estate has been one ot the' 
most active organizations on 
campus. They have sponsored an 
average of ten programs a year. 
First Estate Is also Interested 
In the human aspects ot politi- 
cal problems. At a giant Jam 
session last year. First Estate 
raised over $1200 for the Blaf- 
ran liallof Fund, 

First Estate Is Just one e&gt;:- 
ample of a way In which individ- 
uals can contribute to the better- 
ment of their University, Steve 
Kershoar, president, hopes that 
students Interested in political 
problems will Join First Estate. 
They can contact Sieve through 
the First Estate mailbox In the 
student lounge.

New morality a cause for concern 



BloonUogton, Ind.-- A rock 
amubes a shop wlndon. A youue 
man touches oU a blaze In a 
warehouse. Two girls burglarize 
a house. A car anteana Is snap- 
ped off by a passerby. 

The product ol the osw mor- 
allly? 

A Qoted Indiana University 
scholar In the Insurance field 
fears thai It may be, aDd la 
deeply concerned both asaCbrifi- 
tlan and as an educator. 

Dr. John D. Lone, chairman 
and professor of losurance at 
I.U,, Is expressing ttds deep and 
growlne concern In a liook be Is 
writing, "Ethics Morality and 
Insurance," and recently heread 
some o( the manuscript before 
the sllvBr anniversary seminar 
of the Society of properly and 
Casualty Uoderwr Iters at Atlan- 
tic City. The book will be pub- 
lished during the University's 
Sesqulconleanlal celebration in 
1910 as one of a related series 
on Insurance. 

One of the most fundamental 
characteristics of the new mor- 
ality, says Dr. Long, Is Its chal- 
lenge of authority. 

"The new morality lashesout 
at authoritarianism In any form. 
The authority of clvU law, of 
parents, of teachers, of minis- 
ters, rabbis, and priests, ofmll- 
Itary commanders, of penal war- 
dens, of athletic coaches, of the 
political state, and even of God, 
Himself, Is called into question." 

Abhorrence to Authority 

One of the distinguishing 
characteristics of a large seg- 
ment of current youth, says the 
I.U. educator, Is this abhorrence 
of authority. 

"With this abhorrence ioevlt- 
ably come dellverate and con- 
scious violations of the law a- 
long with dellverate and con- 
sclous-effroterles of duly consti- 
tuted authority. These violations 
and effronteries occur, as we 
know all too well, In the borne, 
on the campus. In the armed 
forces, in the church, and on 
the streets. 



"Disrespect for authority 
suggests violation of civil and 
scriptural law and Doutlng of 
many sensitive social customs 
that do not have the force of 
law. These aberrations. In turn, 
mean that behavior may not be 
as predictable as It has been." 

Dr. Long warns that "many 
Insurancea depend on predicta- 
bility of human betiavlor. 

"If behavioral patterns do 
change. Insurance rate makers 
may be hard pressed, at least 
during the transition, to antici- 
pate correctly the behavioral 
changes that may occur. Other 
things tbesame, Insurance prem- 
iums will bavs to be Larger to 
accommodate the extra risk cre- 
ated by the rate makers not really 
kDowlng how the behavior may 
change during the period towhicb 
the rates apply." 

Arson 

Arson is a good case Inpolnt, 
says i]r. Long. The percentage 
ol the total dollar lire losses 
accounted for by Ores of sus- 
picious origin rose from about 
2.2 in 1950 to about 8.1 In 196T. 
Fire Insurance rates over the 
long run will have to reflect 
not only the losses produced by 
the increased arson, but also an 
additional margin for the uncer- 
tainty about arson behavior In 
the future. 

"Over the decades ahead, the 
new morality may foster the 
proposition that Individuals rath- 
er than society ae a wholeshould 
decide which laws should beobey- 
ed and which should be violated. 
This result would be eittreme- 
ly unfortunate In that law would 
(end to lose its power to coasce 
the elements of the society it 
serves. Insurance and the whole 
social order would be In Jeop- 
ardy. Moreover, since Insurance 
Is on especially sensitive mech- 
anism, it could feel the crunch 
long before other segments of 
society, such as manu&amp;cturlng, 
professional athletics, organized 
religion, or even banking, were 
seriously damaged." 



Ethical Thought 

Dr. Long warns that If by 
1994 a generation or two of 
young peoplu have been weaned 
on the ethical thought that the 
end Justifies the means, we can 
eicpect quite a different pattern 
of moral tiehavlor than was seen 
In the 19E0's. 

"On occasion, and perhaps 
Increasingly, lying, cheating, re- 
neging, coercing, slandering, de- 
faulting, betraying, disappoint- 
ing, undermining, maligning, ma- 
lingering, defiling, robbing, 
burglarizing, wrecking, burning, 
maiming, and even icllilng may 
be regarded as legitimate means, 
fully Justified by the greater good 
growing out of serving the cause 
of agape- love." 

One needslittle Imagination to 
visualize the insurance Implica- 
tions, says the I.U, author. 

"1 suspect that unless recent 
trends are soon halted, several 
types of iheK Insurance cov- 
erages wlU disappear irom the 
market during the 1970'3," says 
Dr. Long. "The upper limit of 
Insurability will have been pene- 

Dr. Long says that In the 
viewpoint of looking a quarter 
of a century or more Into (he 
future, we should recognize that 
if changes In moral tiehavlor ren- 
der some type ol Insurance, such 
as tire Insurance on public 
schools, unworkable In the pri- 
vate insurance sector, the same 
changes protiably also render It 
unworkable In the public insur- 
ance sector. Public Insurance has 
no Inherent, long-range advant- 
age over private insurance. 

New Morality 

Finally, Dr. Long suggests 
that the new morality may afford 
many people over the decades 
ahead a good reason to do pre- 
cisely what they wanted (o do In 
the first place, whatever thatac- 
tlon may be. 



"The new morality may en- 
courage people to rationalize. It 
may provide a convenient Juslt- 
flcadoo for selt-gratlflcatton. In 
terms of future moral behavior 
and the implications for insur- 
ance, this likelihood of ration- 
alization may be by fir the most 
important characteristic of sit- 
uational ethical thought,' 

Dr. Long says that "subscrib- 
ing only to the moral command- 
ment to love, the sltuatlonlst of 
1994, unlike the sKuationlst of 
today, may have no semblence of 
a moral code other thanthe com- 
mand to love. Hindered by Ignor- 
ance and abetted by self-delu- 
sion, he may decide In all good 
faith to do as he pleases." 

In a tree society, he cautions, 
we cannot OKpect that society 
as a whole, through the govern- 
ment or otherwise, will urge 
upon Itself over the long run 
any moral behavior It does not 
want or urge upon Itself any 
moral restraint It does not like. 

"The urging must come from 
a segement less than the whole 



of that society/* Dr. Long con- 
tinues, and "I submit that the 
Insurance industry Is the most 
logical segment of society to 
undertake the task and perhaps 
the only one equipped and moti- 
vated to do so, 

"Whether or not anyone likes 
the development. Insurers are 
caught in the stream of events 
and stand to be critically affect- 
ed by them," 

Dr. Long says a large part 
of the task Is lo attempt to 
persuade society in general to 
behave Itself and, especially, to 
beware of the long-range conse- 
quences of popular acceptance of 
the new morality which has been 
tried often before and hasalways 
been found wanting. The Job is 
to preach the ethical thought on 
which insurance depends. Among 
other elements this ethlclncludes 
a keen distaste for loss an] an 
accute sense of personal respon- 
sibility. Insurance has not work- 
ed and does not work In any 
part of the world where this 
ethic Is lacking. 



Streetcar closes run 



tiy Anne 

Purdue- Indiana Theatre pre- 
sented the highly dramatic and 
moving play. Streetcar Warned 
Desire , to a sold-out house last 
Saturday night. As George Pierce 
Baker once staled, "A play ex- 
ists to create emotional response 
In the audience." That this play 
surely accomplished that cantwt 
be denied. 

The characterizations cre- 
ated by the cast were excellent. 
Julie Buchheit, who played 
Blanche, managed to poriray the 
mUed emotions of one who Ilux- 
uates between the real and the 
unreal. Blanche Is one of the 
toughest roles to play on stage 
and Julie pulled It off complete- 
ly. Audience members undoubt- 
ably remembered her from The

experienced deep emotional love. 
The character liallon of Stella 
was in sharp contrast to that 
of Blanche. Suzl was able to 
capture that special &lt;]uallty of 
compassion andlendernesswhtch 
Is so Important to Stella's role. 
The set and special lighting 
effects did much to add to the 
mood and tone of (he play. The 
"home" of Stanley and Stella 
was properlygruesome.wlthonly 
a curtain dividing the two bed- 
rooms. Several scenes in the 
play were most effective when 
the stage was flooded In blue 
lights, it created an atmosphere 
of unreality. Coupled with this 
was the penetrating music of 
New Orleans Blues and sultry 
Jazi played at appropriate times. 



Food, ivofer shortages cifed 



Bloomlngton, Ind. - "It's dif- 
ficult to see how we can pro- 
vide adequate food and water 
for the present world's popula- 
tion, let alone provide for a 
population that is doubling every 
35 years," said Dr. Dean Fraser, 
Indiana University professor of 
mlcrobloloby. 

"B Is an accepted ^c(," 
Fraser said, ''that already 50 
per cent of the world's population 
Is undernourished. In only a few 
countries, such as Canada, Ar- 
gentina, Uruguay, Australia, and 
New Zealand, is the average diet 
equal to that in the United Stales 
In terms of calories. Elsewhere, 
not only Is the caloric intake 
lower, but food Is even worse 
in terms of quality. Inadequate 
protein, for example. Is corn- 
Trad itlonaUy, Fraser pointed 
out, the world has expanded its 
food resources by cultivating 
more land. "Many agricultural 
eicpertG say that now we are 
using at least 00 per cent of 
the good quality agricultural land 
of the world,' he said. "The 
problem la compounded by the 
encroachment on agricultural 
land with expanding Industry, ur- 
banization, and suburbanlratlon. 
Id some countries, suchas Japan, 
the amount of land devoted to 



agriculture has been sleadllygo- 
Ingdown." 

faking on the Indiana Free 
University's "Crisis: Biology" 
lecture series, Fraser noted that 
there have t)een proposals of 
"exotic solutions, such as dried 
fish meal, raising algae In ar- 
tificial ponds, and making syn* 
thetlc foods from petroleumpro- 
ducts. 1 don't see (hat any of 
these is going to t&gt;e a real so- 
lution to the food problem. They 
all would Involve downgrading our 
present nutrltloDal standards - - 
people would not be getting what 
we consider acceptable foods tew 

The water problem is In many 
ways worse than Uie food pro- 
blem, Fl-aser said. "The only 
place where there are adequate 
figures In this area Is the United 
States,' he said. "Here, the main 
problem is industrialization. 'Hie 
consumption of waier has risen 
at an uolMlievable rate from the 
turn of the century. 

"The principle use of water 
is in food production - - this Is 
something the average person 
doesn't realize. If you calculate 
the amount of water that's con- 
sumed in raising a pound ofbeef, 
for example. It's an enormous 
figure, as is the amount used 
In raising vegetables. So, the 



amount of water directly usedper 
person - - for drinking, bathing, 
etc, - - Is absolutely trivial. 
The amount used In food produc- 
tion comes to 40 to 50 thousands 
of gallons per month per person. 

"A recent presidential com- 
mittee predicted (hat by Uie year 
ZODO the United Stages would be 
using about IB per cent of all 
the rainfall in the courtry. This 
Is prolrably about all the rain- 
fall that can be used, when you 
figure the amount of water that 
goes Into evaporation. Into the 
transphratlon of plants as they 
grow, and the unavoidable runoff, 

"Even when the runoff Isused 
over and over again, as most 
of our major rivers are - - the 
Ohio Is said to be used 3.7 
times before 11 reaches the Miss- 
issippi - - It still Is a fiict 
that we're not going to be able 
to (urn the waieroverbsl enough 
to keep up with the present rate 
of population Increase,' 

Fraser pointed out the near- 
ly prohibitive costs of trying to 
solve water problems by build- 
ing huge systems for re-dlstri- 
butlng available water or tran»&gt; 
porting desalted sea water to the 
interior. By the time such sys- 
tems were buUt, he warned, the 
problem would still remain Uthe
