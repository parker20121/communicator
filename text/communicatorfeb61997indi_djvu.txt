Professor 
to speak 
on stress 



by Shannon Fintort 
Chief Reporter 

John T Cacioppo. professor of psy- 
chology at Ohio State University, win 
speak at IPFW on Monday. Feb. 10. 
Cacioppo is a national lecturer this year 
for Sigma Xi. the National Scientific 
research society. 

Cacioppo will speak on 
"Psychological Stress, the Heart, and 
Immunological Responses" at 7:30 p.m 
in the Classroom-Medical Building. 
Room 159. The event is free and open to 
the public. 

Earlier that day, Cacioppo will 
address the Psychology faculty on 
"Attitudes, Affect and Event-Related 
Brain Potentials" at 3 p.m. in Neil Hall, 
Room B73. 

Cacioppo was the most frequently 
died researcher in psychology in 1996. 
His research has focused on the interac- 
tion between social factors, stress, and 
disease, a topic which is of increasing 
significance in society. He is the editor of 
the journal Psychophysiology and deliv- 
ered the keynote address at the 26th 
International Congress of Psychology in 
Montreal in March 1996. 

Cacioppo is a member of the 
Neuroscience Program, Center for 
Cognitive Science, Institute for 
Behavioral Medicine Research, and is 
director of the Social Psychology 
Training Grant at Ohio State University 
He has also published over 200 articles 
and books. 

"The lecture on Attitudes, Affect and 
Event-Related Brain Potentials is primar- 
ily for the bencfii of psychology students. 
but we would like to stress that everyone 
is welcome." said Elaine Blakemore, 
chair and associate professor of psycho- 
logical sciences. 

Cacioppo has been at Ohio State for 
eight years and has studied this subject 
matter for seven years. 

'Traditionally focus has only been on 
the behavioral approach; I integrate into 
that social and biological aspects The 
role of psychological factors is important 
in how you view the world," Cacioppo 
said. 

Students may visit Cacioppo's web 
site for more information on a variety of 
topics. The address is

Government Association (IPSGA). for 
student activities, and (be other half 
went to the athletic department. 

But under previous chancellor 
loanne Lantz, the allocation percentage 
changed. These changes have carried 
over to the present day. Now 60 percent 
is given to athletics. Activities 
receive 40 percent 

The student service fee is cur- 
rently S3.20 per credit hour. This 
results in a 5237.000 allocation 
toward activities and S35O.O00 
toward athletics. 

"Now we're not carrying over 
that surplus," said Mike Heit, 
IPSGA comptroller "IPSGA is 
simply maintaining and carrying 
over the 10 percent reserve they 
are required by law to keep. Last 
year lots of big requests were not 
met, but everyone tries to live 
within their means and stick 
within a budget." 

"One of the big requests of 
SAB has been to get a big concert 
which costs about S6.000." said 
Kim Jacobs, director of student 
activities. 

"As always, discussions are 



occurring whether raising the (student 
service) fee could enhance campus 
life." said Frank Borelli. vice chancel- 
lor of student affairs. "This could 
involve major concerts, co-sponsored 
events, arts events, increased services 
legal and 




phy that the services provided should 
be for the students since it is their 
money 

"We all need additional funding." 
said Dan Gcbhart, associate athletic 
director. 

According to Gebhart. this amount 
allocated toward athletics reportedly 
covers a mere 60 percent of athletics' 



[oia] operating expenses, 

"This involves 11 sports, 
rals, cheerleading, marketing and pro- 
motions." said Gebhart," we also have 
operating expenses like uniforms, trav- 
el, officials, recruiting and coaches 
salaries and benefits." 

"Our scholarships come 100 per- 
cent from donations." said Gebhart. 

Athletics also raises their own 
money via promotions, ticket sales and 
ad sales. 

Gebhart said that discussion has 
occurred between IPSGA and the ath- 
letics department on the issue of raising 
the fee to meet everyone's needs. And 
if there is a surplus of money perhaps 
even changing to a 50/50 split of funds 
again. He said a number of options arc 
possible as long as there is no net loss 
in funds. However, all decisions can 
only be finalized by the chancellor's 
office. 

"It (money) doesn't necessarily 
need to come from the student service 
fee, but money needs to come from 
somewhere in order to keep up the 
level I and others expect of our pro- 
grams," said Gebhart. 




New demand Air waves may break campus silence 



for 1998 freshmen ttrxxr- 



by Dawn Snarr 
News Editor 

Many appreciate the 
newly found freedom when 
entering the post-secondary 
level of education. 

"When 1 was in high 
school, I hated having to pick 
classes that would supposed- 
ly help me out later, but then 
realized that tbey were of no 
benefit in college, said Matt 
Kent, freshman, "I feel sorry 
for those who are going to 
have stricter scheduling 
placed on them." 

Beginning in the fall of 
1998, Indiana's colleges and 
universities will expect grad- 
uates seeking admission to 
complete the Core 40 cur- 
riculum. 

Core 40 was adopted by 
the Indiana State board of 
education in 1994 as the cur- 
riculum that offers students 
the best preparation for post- 
secondary education and the 
world of work. 

Under the Core 40 guide- 
lines, each ninth grader 
should work with a guidance 
counselor to create a career 
and course plan. In the career 
plans students have to design 
programs of study for grades 
10, 11, 12 under the single 
collegc/tecb preparation cur- 
riculum. 

All students will enroll in 
this single preparation cur- 



of career they might want in 
10 years. 

"1 don't know exactly 
what I want to do in 10 years 
from now. says Andrea Guse. 
freshman at Homestead High 
School. "So what if I take 
these classes and change my 
mind later?" 

As far as the changes in 
scheduling, students will 
move from taking four 
required credits to six in 
math. Pre-algebra will no 
longer count as a credit in the 
Core 40 curriculum. 

Science and social stud- 
ies will change the same way 
as math, meaning six credits 
will be required'in each to be 
qualified for the course plan 

For those who want an 
Academic Honors Diploma, 
six to eight credits need to be 
taken in a foreign language, 
and two in fine arts, along 
with having a "B" average 
G.P.A. and no grades lower 
than a C. 

Vocational education 
which many take at the 
Anlhis Career Center will 
continue to count as gradua- 
tion credits. 

"I can definitely say 
IPFW endorses Core 40." 
said Carol Isaacs, associate 
director of admissions.

world 

the very first 

time. 

If George 

Gounaris, 

Indiana Purdue Student Government 

Association (IPSGA) president, gets 

his way that voice will be speaking to 

you. 

Gounaris has proposed the devel- 
opment of a radio station at IPFW that 
could impact die way university and 
student -related information is made 
available to the community. Although 
Gounaris admits the station wouldn't 
play music or feature a variety of disc 
jockeys, it would relay important 
news and emergency information to 
listeners within a 2.5 to .5 mile radius 
of the campus. 

The station would be a Travelers 
Information System (TIS), an AM 
band, 10 watt station providing non- 
commercial digital broadcasts around 
the clock. 

TTS stations began popping up 
around the country in the 1970s and 
today there are over 500 of (hem at 
places such as Disneyland, national 



parks and airports. A TIS recently 
began broadcasting on the Indiana 
University campus. Indiana 
University's "Beacon" currently 
reports each day's activities and emer- 
gency news items without 
commercial interruption 

"IPSGA has been continually 
looking into the radio station as a 
means for increasing student commu- 
nication on this campus," Gounaris 
said. "The station would let students 
know about the activities at IPFW that 
are geared specifically for them 

"I'd love lo see IPFW have it's 
own radio station (commercial or stu- 
dent-run), but there are a lot of costs 
involved in operating that type of sta- 
tion," Gounaris said, citing operation 
costs, maintenance, upkeep and incor- 
poration into the IPFW curriculum. 

"Setting up that kind of station 
would lake about five years." 
Gounaris added, "and that's a lot 
longer than I have here on campus. 

"The TIS can be set up in one lo 
three years, requires little or no main- 
tenance, a one-lime cost and a simple 
FCC license that is renewed every five 
years," Gounaris said Other features 
include emergency dial-in for the 
campus police to report breaking 
news items — bomb threats, fender- 
benders or weather- related school 
closings — and because it will be dig- 
ital, the 250 messages can be shuffled 
around so you won't hear the same 
news repeatedly 

The cost of the station would be 
about $10,000 to S20.000 — and the 
best news of all is that students won't 
be dipping inio their pockets lo foot 
the bill 

"IPSGA is sending proposals to 
departments who would bencfii from 



such a student service, like athletics, 
fine arts. University Relations, 
Student Activities Board (SAB) and 
others We hope they will recognize 
the benefits of this and we' II be able to 
solicit funding that way," Gounaris 
said. 

"We want this lo be student-con- 
irolled and housed in Walb Memorial 
Union," Gounaris said. "We want to 
avoid having ii somewhere where stu- 
dents won't think it's for them. 

"TIS will give us some flexibility 
as far as what we can offer on the sta- 
tion," Gounaris said "If SAB is hav- 
ing a concert we could play some 
music from the group on the TIS." he 
said, "and we'll be able to be pretty 
creative wilh it 

"We really can't cross over to a 
radio siaiion like we'd really like on 
campus, yei we can look at this as a 
foothold for IPSGA to pursue a radio 
station in the future This is gonna get 
us somewhere," Gounaris said, "but 
we aren't anywhere now." 

Steve Carr. assistant professor of 
communication, sees many benefits lo 
having a radio station at IPFW apart 
from ihe obvious experience it could 
provide communication students. 

"I think in the abstract a radio sta- 
tion is a very good idea for several 
reasons," Carr said "There's so little 
involvement for students beyond 
classes and this would be a nice way 
to encourage activities at IPFW. It 
would also strengthen IPFW's pres- 
ence in the community." 

No formal decision regarding the 
TIS has been made, but IPFW admin- 
islralion has shown inter- 
est in ihe project. 



Matter of fact:

Clothing drive 

Psi Chi. the national honor society in psychology, is conducting a 
national service project titled Adopt a Shelter for 1997. 

In response to this, the IPFW chapter of Psi Chi has adopted the 
Indiana Youth Advocate Program as its benefactor for this project. 
Throughout the spring semester Psi Chi will be conducting several 
fundraisers, one of which is a clothing drive. 

Beginning Feb. 11, Psi Chi will be collecting good used clothing or 
shoes, and new items such as socks and underwear for children ages new- 
born to eighteen years. 

Everyone, including students and faculty is asked lo participate 
Clearly marked barrels will be placed near the telephones in front of the

'Star Wars' strikes Simpson liable 



May the force be with you. 

Han Solo, Luke Skywalker. Darth Vader and labba the Hull all revisit- 
ed local (heater screens this weekend after some 20 years. 

According to Tony Kaescr of Coventry Theaters, all the Siar Wars 
showings, except two, were sold out the opening weekend. 

Most who waited over an hour in line lo gel tickets for the evening 
shows were in their mid twenties. These die hard fans came lo reminisce on 
their youth gone by. 

Many young newcomers lo the "Star Wars" era packed seals in hopes of 
understanding what the hype was all about 

"Star Wars" will be on screens for about three weeks. "Empire Strikes 
Back" will be out on Feb. 2), and, on Mar. 7, "Return of the Jedi" will be 
released.

Crowds gathered outside the Santa Monica courtroom to hear the 
verdict. One question seemed lo cross everyone's minds. 

Almost 16 months after a criminal jury acquitted OJ Simpson of 
ihe slayings of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, 
Ronald Lyle Goldman, a civil jury found the former football player 
financially liable for both deaths. 

On Tuesday night, the six-man, six-woman jury deliberated for three 
days before reluming its verdict, which gave S8 5 million in copensary 
damages to Goldman's family. 

All 12 jurors voted in favor of Ihe plaintiffs on their first ballot. 

The same jury will begin to determine whether lo award punitive 
damages to the plaintiffs 

The civil case was at least ihe second act in one of the most sensa- 
tional legal dramas in recent memory. 



A loud voice cannot complete with

MM RaD-WINNING FILM 

IMcf CMMPUef eONNEoCGTIO] 



The winning experiment "In The 
Company Of Men," was created in Fori 
Wayne. A ciiy in irans form ai ion for 
Hollywood? "Hey. watch this!" the cine- 
malOgraphet exclaimed. "This is our 
lown." 

Neil LaBuie. former iheaier instruc- 
lor from IPFW. and his crew of former 
IPFW students, won the Filmmakers 
Trophy awarded by the other entrants in 
the Sundance Film Festival. Past winners 
include "Clerks" by Kevin Smith. 

LaBute was an IPFW theater instruc- 
tor for two years. It was during this peri- 
od he attempted to stretch the limits of 
performance. 

"You can resonate only so loudly 
beyond live performances Film is a 
great medium. It will always be there In 
twenty years, the public will be influ- 
enced by your work." said LaBuie. 

"In The Company Of Men" is cen- 
tered upon two business men's attempt to 



get even with a female coworker, (played 
by Stacey Edwards) who is deaf. They 
(Man Malloy and Aaron Eckhant exe- 
cute a master plan to deceive the woman 
by pretending 10 admire her and dale her. 
At the end of six weeks, the men intend 
to dump her in order to prove their dys- 
functional agenda. 

"By the film's end, we have an 
unforgiving portrait of sexist and racist 
corporate culture...," said Roger Eben 

Controversy emerges in this drama 
because it exposes raw, desperate human 
nature. Jealousy and revenge surround 
commonplace events everyday, however 
cruel they may be to witness. The film's 
content and depiction explores the roles 
of men and women in a business atmos- 
phere. 

"It's about being honest. These are 
things that happen in ways people don't 
think about. Writers are here to raise 
questions." slated LaBuie. "It is not male 
bashing or feminist. It should make peo- 
ple aware of how people treat each other. 
It's a movie about power and control;

a d d e &lt; 
LaBuie 
Expectatior 
were opti- 
mistic among 
filmmakers 

"I felt we 
had a good 
product." said 
LaBute. "I was 
really cocky." 
added Mark 
Archer, producer. 
Previously. 
Archer and Lisa 
Bartels. line pro- 
ducer, traveled to 
Park City. Utah, to 
weigh their odds at 
the Sundance Film 
Festival. 

"After the pre 
miere we were pretty confident thai we 
would come away with something." said 
Archer. 

The Sundance Festival was founded 
by Robert Redford. One film assistant 
recalls her encounter with the stars. 

"My coal brushed up against his 
coat." said Bartels 

LaBuie said he met with Redford 
twice and talked at lenglfj. LaOute also 
identified other siars such as Peier Fonda 
and Jodie Foster. 

Success has come to the production 
team of "In The Company Of Men " Two 
members of the filmmaking learn are for- 
mer IPFW students. Banels was a former 
television broadcasting major and presi- 
dent of the IPFW Film Club. Mark

"Other than

Heilinger, director

Filming 'in 
The Company Of Men" with lim- 
ited materials was like living as "gyp- 
sies," Hettinger joked. Hettinger 
acknowledges the local individuals who 
donated materials needed to keep pro- 
duction moving. 

Of all the local sites, the Lincoln 
Tower accommodated the independent 
filmmakers the best "Most of the film is 
shot there We were blessed to be there," 
Hettinger said. 

"To achieve this kind of success is 
like living in a dream," according to 
Archer 

"Relationships formed while making 
films are intense and long-lasting; there 
will always be a special bond," said 
Heilinger. 

This team will not slop here, they are 
determined lo do more work in film; 
more projects in Fort Wayne. This team 
is currently "working on several ideas 
already." Archer said.

A §izzlift$ start 

'Burn This ' takes the stage 



by Natalie H«ss 
Surf Writer 

The cast is small but dedicated. 
According lo student dircclor, Joel 
Moorman, some of the crew of 
"Burn This" worked 23 hours 
straight over die weekend correcting 
some technical problems. 

"We've been in the spotlight. 
Being the final run (or many of us 
has elevated our awareness of how 
many people are watching us," 
Moorman said. 

"Burn This" is directed, 
designed and performed entirely by 
campus students or alumni. 

"Bum This" is to take place Feb. 
6 and 7 at 8 p.m. in Studio Theatre. 
Rm. 32 of Ketller Hall Moorman is 
one of four seniors responsible for 
the Purdue-Indiana Theatre (PIT), 
production 

Two of the four cast members. 
Val Landrum and Tommy 
D'Anmmzio, are acting in "Bum 



This" to complete their senior the- 
atre project requirements Costume 
designer Sarah Snyder is also 
involved in the play as her senior 
project.. 

"The senior performance pro- 
ject is required of all theatre 
majors." reports Moorman. "It's 
comparable to writing a thesis but 
rather than a paper, it is a creation." 

Cast member John S. Strachan 
is a freshman theatre education 
major at IPFW Actor Jim Nelson is 
an alumnus of IPFW theatre 

"No one is really in charge. I've 
always believed in that experience. 
Any project should be done as a col- 
laboration of ideas." says the direc- 
tor 

Christina Kulow, director of 
public relations and development, 
summarizes that "Burn This" 
depicts the lives of four characters 
after experiencing the death of a 
close one She also reports it is more 
probing than action driven 



Moorman suggests that the play 
emphasises the importance of indi- 
vidual's introspection and accep- 
tance of what one finds. 

"It is very hard to be honest with 
ourselves about who we are. We 
have to stop and deal with that." 
says Moorman. 

Tickets are being sold at the 
Williams Theatre box office 
Monday through Saturday from 
1:30 p.m. until 5;30 p.m. They can 
also be purchased at the Studio 
Theatre box office in Ketder Hall, 
one hour before curtain time on pro- 
duction nights. 

General admission is S6. Senior 
citizen and&gt; student tickets are $5 
IPFW students with an ID card pay 
S4. 

Following suit with Moorman's 
high expectations, Kulow says. "It 
is a big culmination of a lot of years 
of work, so it should be their best 
performance ever."

spot for a fast bite between classes, 
The Bagel Station is a good place to 
check ouL Located at 3009 East 
State Street, it's a quick five to 10 
minute trip from 
campus, depend- 
ing on traffic 

In business 
for fifteen years. 
The Bagel 
Station is well- 
known for its 
eighteen vari- 
eties of bagels, 
owner Lisa Jackson con 
firms, which are 
made fresh daily 
on the premis- 
es. Any bagels 
unsold at the 
end of the day 
are "recycled" 

into garlic bagel chips Flavored 
cream cheese spreads are whipped 
up daily and scooped generously as 
a condiment for the bagels. If you 
usually grab breakfast on your way 
to school. Jackson also bakes pas- 
tries, muffins and coffee cakes each 
morning, and offers two coffee fla- 
vors each day, as, well as 
cappuccino. 

The Bagel Station's other not so 
well-known claim to fame is that 
practically everything is made from 



spinach round out the salad menu. 
Deli-style sandwiches, made -to- 
order while you watch, are piled 
high between generous slabs of 
homemade bread The corned beef 
pastrami are shipped 
in from the Vienna 
Beef Company of 
Chicago, and the 
baked ham. turkey 
breast and roast beef 
are fat free, according 
to Jackson 

If you 
have a sweet 
tooth, there are 
always six to 
eight cheese- 
cakes available 
each day 



bagels, which contain only 0.02 
grams of fat (except the very popu- 
lar cheese bagel) Though not as 
interesting as the flavored cream 
cheese spreads, fat free cream 
cheese, jams and jellies arc also 
available for your bagel. 

The Bagel Station is open from 
7 am until 6 p.m. on weekdays and 
7 a_m until .1 p.m on Saturdays 



( Jackson ' 
recipe book ) 
includes a total of 28 flavors), in 
addition to 12 kinds of brownies and 
bar style cookies. The Bagel Station 
also serves fruit and cream pies, tra- 
dition cookies and many different 
cakes. Chocolate and carrot cakes 
are available daily and any cake can 
be specially ordered in advance. 

The Bagel Station is definitely 
not a safe haven for persons who are 
watching their fat or cholesterol 
intake, but Jackson said it is possible 
to put a low fat meal together and 
scratch, right on the premises. Two many customers do just that. Fat 
soups and an entree special are pre- free salad dressings are available 
pared each day. as arc the pasta and and homemade dressings are made 
side salads, which change daily, with either olive or canola oil. Fresh 
Chef and garden salads arc stacked fruit Ls available daily and the meat

Staff Editorial 



The military: 

Training gentlemen or barbarians 



Military schools are where 
most of us think boy; are 
turned into gentlemen 
who know the difference beiween 
warfare and peace However, recent 
accounts of male behavior at mili- 
tary schools show that young men at 
military schools are far from being 
gentlemen, and even further from 
knowing the difference between 
wartime and peacetime. 

Lately the military and several 
of its schools have been in the news 
for everything from misconduct to 
healings and hayings It appears that 
what is really being taught in the 
military, and its schools, is 
violence — violence against men 
and women alike. 

It started at the Citadel in 
Charleston, S.C, when Shannon 
Faulkner fought — and won — for 
women to be accepted to the previ- 
ously .ill in, ile, state-funded school. 
Faulkner, who left the school soon 
after being accepted, claimed that 
she was being harassed by members 
of the Citadel. 

From there it escalated to recent 
claims from two new female cadets 
who accused certain students of 
hazing Since then a male Citadel 
cadet accused of hazing the two 
female freshmen has resigned. The 
two women left the academy 
because they said they felt unsafe in 
the company of their male counter- 
pans who — like the women — 
have chosen to protect our country. 

The stale of South Carolina 
ought to be appalled al the values — 
or lack there of — that the Citadel is 
instilling in its students with iheir 
tax dollars. However, citizens of 
South Carolina should not be the 
only ones appalled at the behavior 
that occurs at several of these 
military schools. 

For instance, a female cadet at 
West Point accused a male cadet of 
raping her. The male cadet was sub- 
sequently acquitted of all charges. 
The accusation is the first of its kind 
since the school began accepting 
women in I976. 

A strong message needs to be 
sent across the board that violence 
against women is not acceptable 
and will no longer be tolerated in 
the military 

After all, how can we expect 
these boys to grow into gentlemen 
when it is obvious that violence and 
mistreatment of women, as 
well as men, is becoming a 



regular occurrence? 

Incidents like these beg the 
questions, "Does the military turn 
our men into barbarians?" or 
"Should the military he turning our 
men into barbarians?" 

The mistreatment of women in 
the military is a serious concern, as 
is the mistreatment of men. 
However, women often fall prey to 
sexual abuse whereas men generally 
do not. 

Instead of chastising these 
women, and making excuses for the 
men (which is often the case), these 
women ought to be commended on 
their show of bravery to come for- 
ward in an attempt to root out those 
who arc obviously unworthy and 
incapable of representing our 
American military the way it 
should be. 

Although most attention has 
been aimed toward how men in the 
military mistreat the women in the 
schools, it has also been document- 
ed that mistreatment is not aimed 
exclusively at women. 

For instance, recently aired 
excerpts of videotapes showing sev- 
eral disturbing ba2ing incidents 
going on in the military have been 
released The tapes show marines 
who earned their jump wings by 
stabbing pins into their fellow col- 
leagues' chests. Never mind the 
blood and cries coming from those 
being "pinned." these men appeared 
to be numbed to the cncs of those 
being tortured in such a way. 

The military claims to instill 
responsibility in their soldiers; how- 
ever. Marine generals shunned from 
any responsibility in this matter. 
They even had the audacity to act 
surprised when informed of the pin- 
ning ceremony. 

Thus, with these documented 
acts of brutality a serious look into 
the hardening of these fuiure sol- 
diers ought to be examined. 

Some dismiss these horrific acts 
as necessary to train men for war. to 
make them "tough." After seeing 
how men in the military treat other 
men it really is no wonder that they 
harass women the way they have 
been accused of. is it? 

Do we want these men to grow 
into gendemen who can separate 
wartime from peacetime, or will we 
excuse their barbarous acts as sim- 
ply being "fit for a soldier"?

Letting go: Jeremy Ecenbarqer 



benefits to EACS cutbacks 




Schools 
across 
America are 
constantly 



facility has on staff or the number 
of academic programs available, 
there are always constant cutbacks. 
While this may be a national issue, 
it continues to affect us locally. 

Throughout the past few years, 
East Allen County Schools (EACS) 
have gone through numerous 
changes in order to decrease their 
budget problems First, there was 
the issue of consolidating the 
schools in order to possibly close 
one school and to become more 
racially balanced. Now. however, 
the administration plans to get rid 
of a number of teachers and even 



more schools While the adminis- 
tration may feel that these changes 
may have the least effect on the 
education of students, I 
feel differently. 

Currently, the main issues con- 
cern the possible closing of New 
Haven Elementary and eliminating 
13. 5 teaching positions for art. 
music and PE at the elementary 
school levels. 

Growing up in New Haven. I 
attended EACS for 13 years. Other 
than the regular adolescent prob- 
lems, they were good schools to 
attend. Teachers seemed experi- 
enced and dedicated to their fields. 
Plus, the organizations and activi- 
ties available helped lo point me in 
the nght direction for future plans 

As a child, I was taught to 
appreciate things, rather than just 
the basics of life In faci. if it were 
noi for my drama and music teach- 
ers in grade school, I may never 
have learned 10 be creative with my 
writing. They seemed 10 offer me 



personal attemion and gave me the 
will 10 progress my talents. 

Many elementary school teach- 
ers act as mentors; they introduce 
new ideas that may have once been 
unheard Whether these teachers 
stimulate the interest of the next 
Claude MoneL Amadeus Mozart or 
Michael Jordan, their efforts are 
remembered for a lifetime. 

EACS Superintendent Jeff

Women need to be more than 'good-looking' in the '90s 




These things are admirable, but 
the true path to fulfillment is self- 
expression. Women tend not to give 
themselves enough time to regener- 
ate their attitudes. They often don'i 
get the lime and space away from 
their families or jobs. 

For instance. Carolyn Bessette- 
Kennedy was named "a wonderful 
role model for today's young 
women " Indeed JFK Jr was a good

been heard from Bessette- Kennedy 
since the wedding 

This is only one example of 
what tends to happen 10 famous 
women. The media portrays low 
expectations and only writes about 
the superficial side of women. 
Bessette's long career as a New 
York business woman before her 
marriage 10 JFK Jr. disappeared 
from her biography when she got 
married. 

It docs not matter if we, as 
women, are famous or not. The less 
we speak of ourselves, the easier it 
will be for anyone to discard our 
opinions 



I have often brought up this 
topic with my peers However, sev- 
eral of my female friends had no 
opinion about it They are not inter- 
ested in issues which affect them. 
They do not seem to care about fun- 
damental female issues. 

What most women care about is 
finding a significant other. I know 
that, generally, women go through a 
phase when they change outfits 
more often than a man before a date. 

A lot of women feel the need to 
look perfect or do not want to go out 
at all I. for one, am sick of it. The 
efforts for keeping one's appearance 
become mechanical, routine, mean- 



affect the number of teachers in a 
school, that's when I start to draw 
the line Every year. I seem to read 
or hear about some student who 
managed to make it through school 
without being able 10 read This is a 
disturbing reality. 

However, I do think the Internet 
is informative; 1 use it often Yet. I 
do not believe it needs to be taught 
so early in the educational process. 
For if a student docs not have the 
basics in hand, it is all just 
wasted lime. 

Many college students may 
wonder why 1 have chosen to fur- 
ther bring this problem to their 
attention. Well, many of us have 
children and may already be direct- 
ly affected by this dilemma. For 
others, this is an opportunity to 
speak up and allow others to have 
the same opportunities we had as 
children. 

Getting a good education is a 
must in today's society Everyone 
deserves a fighting chance. 



inglcss. Our identity changes with 
our wardrobe 

This type of cxtcnor beauuTica- 
lion is not representative of the indi- 
vidual. So what, we might look good 
when we go out but nothing has 
changed internally 

Men like someone who is real 
and interesting, not a thoughtless 
shell. Sometimes we must update 
our minds exclusively for our own 
benefit A good place to begin is to 
decide what qualities you like about 
yourself, then make time to do 
something for yourself and you will 
be glad you did.

Let it be said- 



The Communicator extends a sincere 
welcome to any and all members of Lhe stu- 
dent body who are interested in working 
for LPFWs student newspaper. We are 
looking for students wilh diverse back- 
grounds and from all majors to participate 
in all sections of the paper. Experience is 
not necessary. Whether you are a writer, 
artist, photographer, or have an opinioo 
about something, be assured thai your par- 
ticipation will be appreciated and will 
make a difference. 




You might 
not agree with 
me if I were to 
tell you that 
you can be one 
of the happiest 
people in the 
world. In any 
case, you're 
probably curi- 
ous as to bow 
you can do what most Americans 
have been trying to do for their 
entire lives — be happy. The answer 
is simple. First, let's discuss why we 
are nol happy. 

Many say they arc noi happy 
because they do not have enough 
money. Others might not be happy 
because they have low self-esteem. 
or maybe had an altercation wilh a 
spouse, girlfriend or boyfriend. 

First off, happiness does not 
come with possessions or wealth. 
Happiness is a concept A concept in 
a person's mind and each of us 
desires our own type of happiness. 
For instance, some nut might 
actually be happy that he was in an 



altercation with his significant 
other. From his standpoint this 
makes him happy, while it may 
make you unhappy This is, after all. 
bis individual perspective. 

What if that person does not get 
into the altercation thai they want? 
Then they would be unhappy Do 
you see the concept I'm driving al? 
One more lime happiness is in 
your mind. 

If indeed happiness is in the 
mind, it leads to another step and 
solution to the problem(s): A per- 
son's control over their emotions 
Here's a quick example. 

Lars geLs a new bike for his 
birthday. 

Lars' brother scratches the new 
bike 

Lars yells at his brother 
Lars' yelling lets his brother know 
he's mad 

You're probably thinking. "No 
shit!" Lars didn't have to yell, hut 
did to show his feelings, but also 
because he expecied the bike to be 
in a slate of brand- newness. This is 
where we answer the question that 



has plagued societies for cen- 
turies ..drum mil please... 

..Happiness comes from within 
yourself and one's ability not to 
expect anything from any person or 
object. 

Think for a moment about this: 
If Lars didn'i expect his brother to 
keep Lbc bike in a slate of brand- 
newness, he would not have gotten 
upset. 

Conditioning yourself noi to 
expect anything takes lime This is 
noi an easy task to leam and you 
should not ask this of anyone if you 
yourself cannot subscribe to it. Just 
think how much better our civiliza- 
tion would be if we were all taught 
this? 

Remember thai it does not lake 
an eniue society to make you happy. 
Furthermore, it is very difficult to 
offend someone who is not expect- 
ing you to treat them wilh kindness. 

If you are noi content with whai 
you already have, how then do you 
expect to be happy with what you 
want. You see, "want" is a vice few 
know how to get out of, 



The difference between a successful person 

and others is not the lack of strength, not a lack of 

knowledge, but rather a lack of will..

MORE THAN THE SCORE 



TEN'S VOLLEYB/ 



Soto 'Sky-s' over competition 



Las 1 weekend, the Volley dons 
opened up their home schedule 
with iwo conference victories as 
they improved their overall record 
to 4-2 and their MIVA 
record to 4-0. 

Friday night, IPFW beat up 
on Mercyburst College with 
scores of 15-10. 15-? and 15-8. 
Freshman sensation Hector Soto 



paced IPFW with 25 kills, while 
fellow freshman Chris Gisslen 
dished out 48 assists. 

On Saturday, I4th-ranked 
Ohio State fell to IPFW 15-11. 17- 
16. 11-15 and 16-14. After finding 
themselves down 14-9 in the sec- 
ond game, the 'Dons pushed back 
to take control of the 
game and the match. 



ciaifcHaMi 



The men's basketball team 
suffered two losses last week to 
even its conference record to 6-6. 
The team is attempting to remain 
strong even (bougb three of the 
team members were ineligible at 
the beginning of the semester for 
academic reasons. 

On Thursday, Jan. 30, the 
'Dons were burned by Bellarmine 
College by a score of 78-49 
IPFW's defense allowed four 



Knights to score in double digits, 
while their struggling offense was 
led by sophomore forward Kevin 
Beatty's 14 points. 

Saturday night, the 'Dons look 
on Kentucky Wesleyan University 
and lost by a score of 69-84. 
Senior co-captain Jeff Jackson led 
the team with 15 points, while 
senior guard Derek Miller added 
12 points.

Sports Editor 

As he and his teammates 
stretched out and jogged laps before 
Saturday night's contest with con- 
ference rival and 14th-ranked Ohio 
Stale, most of the team seemed 
loose, trying nol to wear themselves 
out menially before the match had 
begun. Many of them were joking 
around carelessly or jogging their 
laps backwards, but all were fully 
aware of the task which was nearly 
at hand, even if they decided not to 
focus on it. 

Just by looking at his eyes, it 
was obvious Hector Soto, a 6-fooi- 
6-inch freshman outside hitter, was 
thinking only about the Buckeyes 
While others routinely jogged and 
stretched, he was nearly sprinting 
around the court before the match 
and looked as if he could have been 
in a yoga-like- trance during the 
stretches. He knew what be bad to 
do and what it would take to get it 
done. 

His teammates have dubbed him 
"Sky," based on his 51 -inch vertical 
jump, but there is much more to 
Soto than bis leaping ability. 

He started playing serious vol- 
leyball during his junior year in high 
school in Arroyo. Puerto Rico, and a 
short two years later he became the 
most sought-after recruit inside or 
outside of the United States. 

"1 didn' t start out as a very good 
player," Solo said. "I've worked 
really hard and have accomplished 
so many things in volleyball." 

For instance, at age 17, Solo 
was the second youngest person to 
have played on the Puerto Rican 
National Team in its hislory. Last 
season in Puerto Rico, he broke all 
team offensive records. He won a 
gold medal on their Jr. National 
Team He has already qualified for 
this summer's World 
Championships, and won 4ih place 
in the event last year. 

It doesn't take a genius to figure 
out why Soto was recruited by near- 
ly every major volleyball program 
in ihe country, bui it might lake one 
to figure out why he came to IPFW. 

UCLA, UC -Santa Barbara and 
" Hawaii are jusl a few of the dozens 



The Lady 'Dons slipped to 7-12 
(4-8 GLVC) after back-to-back 
losses last week. 

Last Thursday night, Ihe women 
fell 15 points short againsl 
Bellarmine College after a 78-63 
loss. IPFW was led by Jessica 
Henry's 17 points and Nicole 
Ruggles tossed in 10. 



IX-spue Jessica Henry, a sopho- 
more guard, scoring 30 points 
Saturday night, the 'Dons lost a 
heart-breaker lo Kentucky 
Wesleyan by a score of 72-70. 
Krista Hennings, a sophomore for- 
ward, added 14 points and 13 
rebounds, and junior forward Leah 
Sheets contributed 15 points.

of schools thai went after Soto. But. 
he came lo northeastern Indiana to 
play for the 'Dons because of ihe 
challenges that it would entail. 

"The schools in California are 
always winning championships," 
said Soto. "I'd like to be a pan of 
hislory and change some of that, so 
I decided dial IPFW would be a 
good place The program and its 
tradition is really why I came here " 

Along with his outstanding 
skills, Soto has brought with him a 
few intangibles 

"I think that his experience at 
such a young age and having played 
in some big maiches for his country 
is immeasurable for this team." said 
Amie Ball, head coach. "The other 
thing [hat he brings to us is an 
opportunity lo have someone who is 
truly a terminator. Someone who 
has ihe physical ability to jusl go up 
and over people." 

Though he's played in only si* 
matches as a collegian, his ability 
alone justifies him stepping up and 
taking on a role as a learn leader. 

"When we start playing badly. 
it's noi that I lose (my temper), but I 
know thai I'm giving 100 percent 
and 1 expect everyone else lo give 
everything that they' ve got as well. I 
think that the first two games in the 
tournament at Ohio Slate we were 
all playing a little lazy. I had to ask 
myself and everyone else to step ii 
up a level," said Soto. 

"He's very competitive," Ball 
said. "He's more competitive than 
you would first realize from just 
talking lo him or watching him 
warm up. bui if you watch him play 
the game, when bad things happen, 
whether he was involved or not, he 
gels very intense, He really enjoys 
playing the game. He just absolutely 
loves volleyball." 

"He was certainly bom with a 
natural jumping ability." said Ball 
"He does work hard, but he siill 
doesn't work hard enough — yet. 
He doesn't understand that he has to 
work hard all the time. But, I cer- 
tainly think that with the attitude he 
has, things are unlimited as fax as his 
potential goes." 

In other words, the "Sky" is the 
limit.

Young democrats recruit 



by Susan .Spintllrr 
SlafT Writer 



w* 



' nil rcccnl attention focus- 
ing on political issues and the politi- 
cians themselves, it's no wonder 
that the Young Democrats have 
found ibeir way back 10 
Northeastern Indiana. 

Tbe Young Democrats regener- 
ated in May 1996. largely because 
Ihc Democratic Party wanted to gel 
young people involved in politics. 

Tbe idea is to get interest rolling 
from people wilh varying back- 
grounds Today, the Young 
Democrats arc not strictly made up 
of political science majors. There 
arc numerous social science majors 
interacting as well. Brian 
Kcnworthy. who is presently the 
vice president of YD majored in 
political science, and is awaiting 
acceptance to law school. 

"This helps me to stay involved 
wilh my major, even though I'm not 
in school presently," said 
Kenwonhy 



During an election year the 
Young Democrats are active with 
the local Democratic party. 

"We meet with ihc candidates, 
attend the electoral events, and get 
(our) feet wet in politics." said 
Kenwonhy. "It's a behind the scenes 
look at politics." 

The goals of the Young 
Democrats don't solely revolve 
around politics. 

"Were maintaining moti- 
vation to keep interest, since 
it's not an election year," 
said Jessica Henry. 
president. 

Henry, a com- 
munication major 
with a theater ai 
degree, says it's important to 
"gain membership, and plan 
activities that maintain interest' 
Henry also feels that the group 
needs 10 build a better relationship 
with ihe Democrats of Allen County 
by becoming more active wilh them. 

This spring they would like to 
become involved in the Habitat for 



Humanity project and possible- 
fundraisers in February They would 
also like to hold some college-age 
events 

"Our goal is to be productive in 
community and have fun at me same 
lime," said Kenwonhy. 

Young Democrats meet the first 
Sunday of each month.The meetings 
are open lo anyone and are held at 
various locations. 
Students interested in more infor- 
mation may call (219)

The Sol purpose is sun 



by Shannon Finton 
StafT Writer 

Future: What will happen; what 
is going lo be. Future can also be 
defined as something that is impend- 
ing or approaching, An even more 
exciting way to define ii could be 
"solar power." 

There is a new club on campus 
called Ihe Indiana/Purdue (IP) Solar 
Raycing Club, attempting to inform 
people on alternative uses of the 
sun, such as using it to power a car. 
The group is approximately two 
months old. Their constitution was 
approved by Indiana-Purdue 
Student Government (IPSGA) this 
semester 

They have two primary goals at 
this time. The first one is the impor- 
tance of educating people of solar 
power. It is necessary for students to 
understand that gas is becoming 
expensive and does not have lo be 
ihe main source of fuel The second 
goal of the club is a mixture of cre- 
ating unity and campus life. 

"It is important lo get students 
active on campus and give ihem 
s to stay on campus." said

Casey Lengacher, dire 
of the club. 

IP Raycing is building a solar 
powered car which will be entered 
into the Sunraycc. a race that is held 
every lWD years. The race starts in 
Indianapolis and ends approximate- 
ly 1,200 miles later The destination 
is near Denver. Colo. Included in the 
70 teams that signed up for the ten 
day race are groups from Yale. 
George Washington University and 
MIT (Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology). 

"It is a high level race and com- 
petition is fierce," said Lengacher 

Location, course taken and geo- 
graphic elevations are important in 
the race. There can be no mountain 
ranges; only flat soil. 

"If someone was to run out of 
juice on a hill, that would noi be 
good," said Ixngacher. 

Participants are students from 
every faction IP Raycing is current- 
ly working on trying to unify all 
engineering students and designated 
student organisations. 



Funding for this event is possi- 
ble through the United States 
Department of Energy. General 
Molors and Electronic Data 
Systems. 

"Sponsors like to see a lot of 
effort and people working together 
to move an event along," said 
Lenagacher. "The club is new and 
ai the very beginning of the design 
process, so join now." 

Sunrayce is looking for mem- 
bers and sponsors. If anyone is inter- 
ested, call Lengacher at 485-2372. 
They may also be contact- 
ed through [heir web site 
cvax.ipfw.indiana.edu/-lengcl01 
/car.htm 

"Student organizations should 
all have web access," said 
Lengacher. 

IP Raycing club meetings arc 
usually held every Monday from 1- 
1:50 p.m. in Walb Memorial Union, 
Room 225. Meetings are always 
subject to change. Students can

HIV/AIDS 

Q&amp;A 



Q. What's the risk of 
getting AIDS from a 
blood transfusion? 

A. In the U.S. the chance 
of HIV infection through 
transfusion is low. Red 
Cross figures for Allen 
and Wells counties show 
that individuals 
receiving transfusion 
have a 1 out of 225,000 
for each pint of blood 
received. There is no 
risk in giving blood.
