Joe student faces 
closed class lists 



Krtshiiiati yi^r J«- Sludenl Ihumba 
Ihrough the IPF'W Bulielln and plans his 
COUTK of ocllon (or hl» firat scmesler of 
college — a tevi general requiremcnls 
here, o major core requirement there, 
and hey. maybe even an eleclive In 
racquelball or somelhing. 

So far, w good. Fall schedules come 
oul. and .loe, being the brighl and eager 
potential Yuppie Ihal he is, makes a 
special trip out to the IPFW campus to 
pick one up. Finding several of the 
classes he had Intended to take unlisted. 
Joe Is undaunted. No problem. Just lill In 
a few other general require men Is, forget 
rocquctball — It's only offered late In the 
flflemoon and In the momlng when Joe 
has to take annther closs — and wonder 
of wonders, Joe's schedule pans out 
pretty nicely for his firs I semester of 

Then comes early registration, and 
Joe [Inds he has to schedule on the last 
doy. OK, all the other freshmen hove to 
schcdiJc after everybody else, too. No 
Bfcal foreaecable problems arc In store 
for Joe, 

But alas, that core requirement Joe 
WEinled to gel out of the way is closed. He 
ponies momentarily, but after a bit of 
Juggling, rinds he con fit in on obscure 
jclass he hadn't Intended to take. Oh well, 
Jmc more free elective down, 
; Sophomore year: Joe student thumbs 
through IPFW's Bulletin and plots his 
course of uctiun for the fall semester oF 
p\s sophomore yoar. a little older, o Utile 
Wiser, a little more fluent In Schedules 
tand Russian - remember that free 
eiccllve last [alii? 

Ills first IhDughi is getting in Ihot core 
rcquircmenl tic had wanted to take last 
fall. To his dismay, Joe finds the class is 
nut ll.stcd, and goes to his advisor to 
Inquire about It. "Oh, that class Is only 
offered every alher year, Joe." says his 
helpful advisor. "Why don'l you take a 
different core requirement, or gel one of 
your social science olecllves over with? " 

Joe compiles. Scheduling time comes. 
All the Inlcrcsting sounding social 
science classes are closed. Joe takes 
tccond year Ru^fj^n,; Onf more, (ice 
fclcctive down. 

Junior year Juc Sludenl is sick and 
tired of thumbing through Bullcllns. He 



has a maslCT plan of every class he 
needs from now until graduation. His 
schedule for the ncJil two years will only 
work one way, and he is willing to kill 
anyone who tries to get in front of him in 
line at early registration. Joe knows this 
is his last chance for that 
requirement. He knows it will 
having to drive 29 miles, three nights a 
week to a class that isn't over unlit 10: 15 
p.m., but he has no choice. The closed 
class list shows the other two meeting 
times of the class are already closed, 

Joe gels the last bubble on the class 
list; he's inl He suffers through his 
junior year with hard core classes he 
had tried to distribute throughout his 
first two years (but we know how that 
wenti and pulls out a GPA of 2.5 out of 4. 

Senior year: Fall schedules come out 
Joedoesn'tlookatlhem, hedoesn't need 
(0 — he's been around to every depart- 
mental secretary making sure classes 
aregolngiobeoffered whenhecan lake 
them. He enters the registration line two 
hours early. Paranoia overwhelms him 
Clutching his regislration card to his 
chest, he Is certain anyone who sees the 
classes he has listed will get to the 
bubble-ladies before he can and get the 
last seat. 

Joe approaches the harried- looking 
bubble woman and stretches oul his 
quivering arm to hand her the card. He 
holds his breath — one bubble down... 
two ... three ... four bubbles down - just 
one more. "God. "he pleads silently, "I 
swear I'll never ask you for another 
thing as long as I live if you get me in this 
class." Joe follows the woman as she 
ominously approaches the list with his 
class on it, and discovers to his 
astonished delight — a whole row of 
empty bubblcsl Oh Joy of joys! Oh 
rapturcl Oh,,, what did he just hear the 
woman say? 

"Looks like there's not a lot of Interest 
in this class, Joe. Chances are they 
probably won't offer it again until next 
fall," 

Joe Is in a place called Bcllcvue now, 
locked in a peaceful padded cell, making 
paper airplanes out of old IPFW 
Bulletins, rocking back and forth and 
cursing lightly under his breath .., in 
Russian.
