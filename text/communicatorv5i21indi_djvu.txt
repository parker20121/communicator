Center helps women

Melting snow and occasional downpours caused the St. Mary's River to escape its banks and 
crowd the trees surrounding it late last week. This scene was captured near Decatur, where 
waters crested to over 20 feet. 



Gentner opposes flood plan 



By PETER BOYKIN 

A recently-inaugurated federal 
flood insurance program could econo- 
mically prohibit further development 
and require remodeling of many 
buildings in the northern portion of 
Fort Wayne, according to one city 
official. 

The Federal Insurance Adminis- 
tration (FIA) of the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development 
(HUD) has taken the first steps 
toward forcing touch new restrictions 
on construction in flood-prone areas 
including Fort Wayne, explained 
William Gentner, Urban Affairs 
Coordinator. 

Gentner said the new law will force 
property owners in most of northern 
Fort Wayne to buy federal flood 
insurance and remodel their existing 
structures. Remodeling to flood-proof 
standards would protect all business 
establishments and personal res- 
idences against the type of flood that 
the city experienced in 1913, he said. 
Existing sewer, water and electric 
lines will also have to be flood- 
proofed. 

Gentner said unless the com- 
munity adopts such flood control 
ordinances, all banks and lending 
institutions here will be prohibited 
from financing the construction or 
acquisition of structures in flood- 



out of billions of dollars to help 
victims of the costly series of storms 
and hurricanes from August, 1969, to 
June of 1972. 

Hurricane Agnes, the last of the 
storm series, cost the federal govern- 
ment more than $2 billion. Total 
outlays for loans and grants to flood 
victims over the past five years have 
exceeded $4.5 bilJion, Gentner said. 

After a community is notified it is 
flood-prone the next step is the 
adoption by the FIA of a flood-hazard 
boundary map for the community. 
Then the community is required to 
begin passing housing and building 
construction ordinances governing 
the areas designated as flood-prone. 

To help with the job of turning out 
the needed maps, Gentner said the 

Students invited to 
history symposium 

The Department of History in- 
vites all history and social studies 
majors to attend a "History Graduate 
Schools and Careers Symposium" in 
the Richardsonville and Canal Rooms 
(226-228) of the Student Union 
Wednesday January 30 from 3:00 to 
4:00. Speakers and questions will be 
directed to career alternatives in law, 
government employm ent, corporate 
business, public school teaching, and 
professional historian occupations. 
Refreshments will be provided. 



FIA has contracted the services of the 
Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. 
Geological Survey and others. Fort 
Wayne has such maps, he said. 

Flood-prone areas in the city 
include all of the area engulfed by the 
1913 flood and most of the northern 
part of the city, Gentner said. 

Gentner explained the time basis 
of the Corps of Engineering studies. 
It indicates that a flood-prone area 
consists of an area that could be 
statistically flooded once every 100 
years such as the flood of 1913. 

He further stated this would 
include areas that could flood from 
the most severe combination of 
metereological and hydrological con- 
ditions that the Army Corps of 
Engineers consider reasonably char- 
f the geographical region 



what the 1913 flood engulfed. 

Indiana-Purdue campus and Can- 
terbury Green Apartments would fall 
into this area. 

Gentner said federally-financed 
flood insurance would cost the 
homeowner $50 per year to cover the 
first $3,500. For any value above this, 
the homeowner would have to buy 
additional flood insurance from a 
private insurance company. 

"In the long run, "Gentner 
concluded, "the effect of this new law 
would eventually create vast green 
belts in Fort Wayne which would 
practically wipe out the city." 



Lebamoff new Demo county 
chairman; blasts Beers 



By MARK FRANKE 

"There is not as much ethically 
wrong about my being mayor and 
county chairman as there is about the 
Republican county chairman getting 
State legislation passed so his law 
firm can get a bond issue." 

Mayor Ivan A. Lebamoff leveled 
that charge at Republican County 
Chairman Orvas E. Beers immediate- 
ly after Lebamoff was elected without 
opposition as Democratic County 
Chairman last Saturday. 

Lebamoff said that Beers' law 
firm stands to get a $500,000 bond 
issue if the Genera! Assembly adopts 
legislation establishing a regional 
airport authority. 

"The newspaper which will 
attack me most for this is working 
with the legislature to take our airport 
away from us," said the mayor, 
referring to a Fort Wayne News-Sent- 
inel editorial stance in favor of a 
regional airport authority. 

Lebamoff said he expects criti- 
cism from his opponents regarding 
his holding of both the mayor and 
county chairman posts. He repeated 
that he sees nothing unethical about 
holding both positions. 

The mayor promised during his 



1971 campaign that he would resign as 
county chairman should he be elected 
mayor. He was elected and did resign, 
but since that time the Democrats 
have been through two chairmen, 
Charles Belch and Nat Sheray. 

Lebamoff said he had no qualms 
about replacing Sheray, who resigned 
because of business pressures. Sher- 
any endorsed the mayor for the 
county chairman's post, saying that 
Lebamoff pulled the part "out of the 
depths of degradation and made it 
into a real political power structure." 

Sheray said that he would not 
fade away from politics but that he 
would continue to work for the party. 

City Clerk Charles Westerman 
nominated Lebamoff for the post, 
calling him a builder in the Democrat- 
ic Party. City Councilman John 
Nichols seconded the nomination, 
saying Lebamoff had pulled the party 
out of chaos during his previous term 
as county chairman. No other 
nominations were made. 

Lebamoff charged that the state 
legislature was giving Allen County 
the support it deserves. He cited the 
fact that $500,000 needed for a 
community corrections center was 
not included in the supplemental 
budget that passed the House last

January of last year. 

The primary purpose of the 
Center for Women is to assist women 
who are returning to school after a 
long lay off, and generally to attempt 
to reach all adult women in the

Mrs. Thorns also acknowledged 
that the center gets things going for 
co-eds by helping to prepare them for 
decision making and life planning. 
She noted that, "Planning should be 
an important part of any young 
woman's life. After all, most women 
have to work for at least thirty years 
of their life." 

She also added that the center has 
been working with business and 
industry to build up a relationship 



He called for the Allen County 
legislative delegation to spend more 
time on such critical problems as lack 
of summer jobs for youth, poor 
housing, tax reform, and unequal 
treatment of minorities and women. 

The mayor reminisced about the 
accomplishments of his city adminis- 
tration. He said that the Democrats 
have done more for all the people than 
did past Republican administrations. 

He called the City Hall-City 
Council good and commented "how 
well the relationship between the 
mayor and Council had really 
worked." 

Lebamoff was last elected county 
chairman in 1968. He has been praised 
for taking a party that was in 
shambles and building it into a strong 
organization. Lebamoff's accomplish- 
ments include J. Edward Roush's 
victory over ten-term Cong) 
E. Ross Adair in 1970 i 
Democratic sweep of all but

Actually the Center for Women is

For continuing education 



Kellogg awards nursing grant 



The W.K. Kellogg Foundation of 
Battle Creek. Michigan, has awarded 
a three-year grant of $373,781 for the 
Indiana Statewide Plan for Continu- 
ing Education in Nursing. 

The Indiana Plan and the Kellogg 
grant will establish quality nursing 
education programs which will pro- 
vide Hoosier nurses with easy access 
to continuing education in new 
developments and advances in their 
profession. 

The Kellogg grant will be 
administered through the Indiana 
University Foundation and the Indi- 
ana University School of Nursing. The 
board of directors for the Indiana 
Plan has the responsibility for its 
implementation. 

At the close of the grant period, 
the project activities will be coordi- 
nated by the Indiana State Nurses' 
Association. 

The statewide plan provides for 
the establishment of ten regional 
centers for continuing education in 
nursing, sponsored by colleges and 
universities in regions of Indiana. 

REgional coordinators already 

&gt; been appointed and supported 



by Indiana Stale University School ol 
Nursing, Terre Haute; Ball State 
University Department of Nursing,

Indianapolis 



since 1904 at Indiana-Purdue, has 
been appointed regional coordinator 
for the program 



Regional coordinators supported 
by the grant at various phases of the

Department of Nursing, Goshen; 
IU-PU Fort Wayne; IU-PU Indiana- 
polis; Columbus Center of IUPUI; 
and Indiana University, Kokomo; and 
Purdue University Department of 
Nursing, Lafayette, as potential sites. 

At the end of the three-year grant, 
the participating colleges and univer- 
sities will assume responsibility for 
maintaining continuing nursing edu- 
part of their 



program offerings.

Urge to urge Atlas to shrug 



Collective bargaining 

The issue of collective bargaining for university professors seems to 
have many unanswered questions. At least the state legislature thinks so, 
because the proposed bill of collective bargaining for public employees 
presently excludes professors. 

This action, or more appropriately, inaction, has left many local 
professors dissatisfied with the present state of affairs. They are still 
confident that AFT and AAUP forces can lobby for positive action in the 
State House, even though it is felt that an atmosphere of 
anti-intellectualism prevails there. 

The argument in favor of collective bargaining revolves around the 
fact that pay increases for professors have been half that of the increase 
in the cost of living. The professors believe that if collective bargaining 
included them, the pay increases would be forthcoming. 

From a student's point of view, one would be concerned that if 
professors are included in collective bargaining, the pay increases they 
demand will be paid out of an increase in tuition fees. The cost of higher 
education is exorbitant now. Students can not afford to pay more for high 
pay increases for professors. 

The issue of collective bargaining must be analyzed critically so that 
it may benefit professors without hurting students.

BOSTON - In his great book, 

"Socialism." written more than thirty 
years before his death last month at 
age 92, Ludwig von Mises said: 



himself if society is sweeping toward 
destruction. Therefore everyone, in 

his own interests, must thrust himself 
vigorously into the intellectual battle. 
None can stand aside with unconcern; 
the interests of everyone hang on the 
result. Whether he chooses or not,

D'Anconia asks Rearden: 

"If you saw Atlas, the giant who 
holds the world on his shoulders, if 

you saw that he stood, blood running 
down his chest, his knees buckling, his 
arms trembling but still trying to hold 
the world aloft with the last of his 
strength, and the greater his effort 
the heavier the world bore down upon 
his shoulders - what would you tell 



Good SUB year 



So far this year, the ten members of the Student Union Board are 
attempting to outdo themselves. Never before has IU-PU been blessed 
with such promotive types in organization. 

The quality and quantity of the concerts has been fantastic. But more 
important has" been the range of music that they have sponsored. The 
presently popular sound of rock has been promoted quite often, but the 
upcoming wooden music and David Bromburg concerts show that easy 
listeners and folk lovers are not forgotten. 

The beauty of it all is the well-known names they have drawn. For a 
campus of this size, and the relatively small budget with which they 
operate, we must consider ourselves lucky to see and hear such talent. 

The Union Board members are at work for ski freaks as well. It is 
time to wax those skis, because the trip to Cannonsburg is coming up

My third major lifetime disap- 
pointment hit hard as 1973 expired 
and the only thing Dial sustains me is 
the possibility that 1974 may produce 
realization of dreams and hopes. 

The first big disappointment, in 
the late '20s and early ".SOs, was three 
years of futility in the wish to make an 
all-star football team I those were the 
days when you didn't have to be nine 
feet tall and weigh 265 pounds to

My best girl didn't desert me over 
this failure and the walls of pride 
didn't come tumbling down. But the 

The next disappointment, not 
quite so bitter, but nonetheless 
failure to earn a Medal 
the Pacific Fighting of 
[. There would seem to 
Dugh opportunities in the 
Marshalls, Saipan, Philippines and 
Okinawa, but perhaps my instinct 
was more cowardly than heroic when 
the moment of truth came. Regard- 
less, it was a bitter pill to swallow, 
particularly after all the letters sent 
home concerning heroic (imaginary) 
achievement. 

Those two failures were block- 
busters but in retrospect they were 
nothing compared to the most recent 
devastating disappointment. 

What could have gone wrong this 
time? It would seem that I would have 
been a lead pipe cinch. 

I have known Gerald Warren, 
White House deputy press secretary, 
for over 15 years and he never cared 
for me particularly. I have known 
other people in and around the White 
House and the association never has 
been what you might call chummy. 
With that background, how in the 
world could I have been left off the 
White House official "Enemies List." 
I feel cheated, ignored, discriminated 
against. The men close to President 
Nixon picked 575 enemies for Intenial 
Revenue Service "dirty tricks" and I 
couldn't even qualify as No. 575. A 
crushing blow. 



You can't exactly say that 
anybody has pinned anything bad on 
President Nixon despite all the off- 
looking things that have hit very close 
to him, but a badge of honor these 
days is being an "enemy" of the long 
parade of rascals who have labored 
for him in the White House. It's a pity, 
because he deserves something better 
- or he should have been more 
watchful of his most trusted aides. 

The "Enemies List" has not 
received the publicity that Watergate 
and some of the other White House 
shenanigans have - perhaps it's like 
throwing apples in the apple orchard- 
but it is a most despicable situation 
when a top White House man tells the 
IRS to go after 575 people. Republi- 



cans included, who have spoken out in 
opposition to the Nixon politics. 

Warren has said the President 
had no knowledge of the plot until a

Well said.

it was the year of the big disappoint-

perhaps?

I guess I am inspired in this

the unqualified castigation of our

Army reflects low 
morale of country 



By the Free Campus News Service 

For the sixth consecutive month 
since the draft ended, the Army has 
fallen substantially short of its 
recruitment goals. Of those who did 
volunteer in July, 34 per cent were 
black-a figure which, not entirely by 
coincidence, approximates the rate of 
unemployment among black teen- 
agers. The proportion of recruits with 
low intelligence scores rose to 31 per 
cent in July, compared with a 
projected limit of 18 per cent. 

One needn't accept the view that 
the all-volunteer army has been a 
"disaster"-the hasty conclusion of 
many, including all who prefer 
compulsion on principle-to realize 
that there is a problem. Presumably 
there is some level of pay that will 
attract enough numbers. Relatively 
high pay is one of the inducements 
that get us rangers to parachute into 
forest fires and police to work on 
bomb squads. If the Air Force is 
attracting more volunteers than it 
needs (which it is), while the Army 
combat divisions a^e running short, 
then Army infantry pay might be 
increased to compensate for the belief 
that the work there is more difficult or 
dangerous (or boring) than in the Air 
Force. The higher level of pay or 
benefits would tend by itself to attract 
a higher caliber of young men, but 
there should also be a differential for 
skill, education, or ability: If high 
school dropouts and skilled mechan- 
ics start at the same bottom rung, we 
should not be surprised that we get 
many dropouts and not eno 1

While we might do more to increase 
the alternatives open to young

isn't obvious that we should simply 
deny them access to what many of 



be solved by busing them to the 
Navy), it might be alleviated in some 
degree by doing more recruiting in 
Northern suburbs. 

The all-volunteer army is having 
some growing pains, as its responsi- 
ble advocates expected. An imagina- 
tive jiggling of incentives should be 
able to overcome many of these. And 
before jumping to a premature 
negative verdict on the all-volunteer 
experiment, it is relevant to recall 
that the draft, in these recent years, 
was giving results something less 
than ideal. An army cannot live a life 
of its own apart from the nation. If the

Dating rules set for feminists 



By AUDREY GELLIS 

From time to time I get a 
complaint from a young man which 
goes something like this: "I ask a girl 
out, she accepts. We go to dinner, I 
call for the check - and she pulls out 
her wallet. I tell her no, I invited her 
i loudly on splitting the 






scene. I feel humiliated." 

Now these women may think 
they're asserting their liberated 

selves, but in reality they're playing 
the preliberation game of leading a 
man on - to a calculated disappoint- 

A really liberated woman will tell 
a date in advance if she v 
her own way (or whatever 
ground rules she may have). The 
basis of a liberated relationship 
should be honesty and consideration, 
not monetary oneupmanship. 

Surprisingly, this question of who 
pays for what and how much is more 
emotional and touchy than many of 
the major issues involving economic 
and legal rights. To a man, his ability 
to "provide" is a reflection of his 
manhood (though there is often a 
subconscious resentment at having to 



Most women (even those who 
claim to like the idea of the man 
footing the entertainment bills) feel 
some subconscious resentment be- 
cause of the dependency this arrange- 
ment entails. Obviously, whoever 
pays is going to make the decisions as 
to the "whens, wheres and whats" of 

The purpose of an invitation to 
dinner is not to prevent malnutrition - 
this is a highly complex social rite 
which involves intimacy (just look at 
the way any restaurant is set up), the 
sensuality of good food and drink, the 
luxury of being waited on. This formal 
"breaking of bread together" is so 
fraught with symbolism that we 
automatically assign it to the two 
activities our society values most -

business and love. Small wonder that 
feelings of ego, pride and sexual 
adequacy are involved. 

Most men, even if they are not 
male chauvinists, expect to pick up 
the check when they invite a woman 
to dinner (as anybody who does the 
inviting usually does). I asked some

i tried vainly to get a 
t the last two years. 
ur neighbors are not 
e damned well ready. 

Last summer the Russian Nationals were supposed to 
play "Booby Orr," as they call him, and some other NHL 
All-Stars in Canada. But the Soviets created a few minor 
hassles and declined to make the trip. 

However it appears very likely that sometime next fall 
the greatest sports spectacle of all time (in my opinion) will 
finally take place. 

And do the Soviets think they are going to triumph? 

As you might guess, the Soviets know they are going to 
conquer. The way they have it figured is this: the NHL may 
have "Booby Orr" (whom they have seen on American 
television and of whom they are scared to death) and a few 
other top-rate skaters, but overall the CCCRs have the edge 
in depth, precision, and teamwork. 

The Russian Nationals have one sizable weakness- 
defense. Their defensemen are not overly quick and agile, 
and are (as of now) rather slow in picking up the play. But 
they've got many months to improve, and undoubtedly 
improve they will. 

In past years players on the Soviet squad sported short 
haircuts (with no hint of sideburns) and drab clothing. They 
rarely smiled and off the rink were anything but 
personable. 

However when they appeared for their prep sessions 
with Western Hockey League teams, they were stunningly 
the opposite. The athletes' hair tumbled over their ears and 
most sideburns were an inconceivable three inches below 
the lobe. 

Their off work garb was only the latest in Western 
fashion, and their frequent smiles even seemed to contain a 
bit of warmth. No, we must be dreaming. 

Nevertheless, when this Super Hockey Series gets off 
the ground, it will in all likelihood be a brilliant titanic 
affair. The Soviets know they are going to win. 

But the Soviets knew they were going to win the 
Summer Games Basketball Fest in Moscow. And they lost. 

EVEN MORE MONEY ON THE LINE 

It is said that as a result of the "Fight of the Century" in 
1971, both Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali received nearly 
S2.5 million apiece. Ali lost the fight and since has been 
unimpressive. Joe Frazier quickly lost his title as 
heavyweight champion of the world by being decisively 
kayoed in the second round against the heavy underdog 
George Foreman. 

Tonight the two has-beens will grapple again at 
Madison Square Garden in front of an SRO throng. Over a 
million more will observe from closed circuit TV. 

The loser tonight stands a good chance of being 
finished, especially if it's Cassius Clay, as Joltin' Joe refers 
to him. The winner will in all probability get another shot at 
the world title and another giant take. 

But talk about a big purse ! Each performer in tonight's 
rematch will be collecting S3 million. So Ali and Frazier are 
winners even before they step into the ring. 

This writer sees a kayo deciding tonight's match. It will 
come in the first six rounds of the scheduled 12-round bout 
and will be administered by Joe Frazier. 

The post draft Mr. Ali has simply not been impressive. 



INTRAMURAL BASKETBALL HAS GREAT BEGINNING 

No less than 30 teams have been formed for this year's 
Indiana-Purdue intramural basketball league. Divisions 
have been set up, and contests will take place every Monday 
through Friday. 

No doubt there will be less than 30 squads around at the 
end of the campaign for the playoffs, but still the way has 
been paved for an extremely successful season. University 



BILL ORWIG VISITS IU-PU 

Indiana University athletic director Bill Orwig paid a 
visit of Indiana-Purdue Thursday afternoon and met for two 
hours with campus administrators and faculty. His main 
concern was the gathering of information on the IU-PU 
athletics program. 

The campus sports set-up was explained to him, and he 
received pertinent athletic budget and policy material to 
examine. He appeared favorably impressed with the 
development of the Indiana-Purdue athletic program, but 
obviously at that time could make no promises of future aid 
from Bloomington. 

Dr. Edwin Leonard, chairman of the IU-PU Joint 
Athletic Committee, told Orwig: "We fee) we are the most 
advanced regional campus school in athletics." Leonard 
added that one of the major problems has been to establish 
a respected identity for Indiana-Purdue. 

And therein lies perhaps the greatest problem facing 
Indiana-Purdue in continuing the rapid development of I 
campus athletics: the other Indiana regional campuses are 
behind this campus' pace. Some of them are woefully 
behind in some areas. 

If we are to receive support from the parent campus, 
the other Indiana campuses will likely have to be included 
as well. And if they don't show the right qualifications, then 
simply no school will receive any support. 

Another possible drawback was offered by Orwig, "You 
have two schools, Indiana and Purdue, involved in the 
situation, " he said. 

But at least an interest has been shown by the Indiana 



NAIA-affiliated squads." 

The question of women's athletics was brought up 
during the meeting. "Presently there is no support for 
women's facilities and programs at Indiana or Purdue 
(parent campuses). And there's a lot of pressure being 
applied," Orwig commented. He then strongly offered his 
stand on the matter. "The more initiative you can take to 
get women involved, the better off you are. If the 
intercollegiate athletics for men are good, then they should 
be good for women," he said. 

Orwig plans to visit the other Indiana regional 
campuses in the near future and continue his fact-gathering 
mission. Hopefully he will be pleased with what he finds and 
will pursue the matter of regional sports further.
