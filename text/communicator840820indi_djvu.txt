The Communicator 

Indiana University-Purdue University at Fort Wayne 



Aug. 20, 1984 



IPFW begins to walk 




The land that IPFW is located was once a farm, property of the State Hospital. The hospital is now located 
across St. Joe Road from the campus. 



By MIKE ROEGER 

Editor-in-Chief 

Twenty years, for some, may be 
a lifetime, for others, a meer drop 
in the bucket to a lifetime. For 
IPFW, 20 years is a lifetime. 
IPFW will be celebrating its 20th 
birthday in November. 

When compared to many of the 
great learning institutions of our 
country, 20 years is mere infancy 
for a college. But unlike the other 
institutions, IPFW is the result of 
an unusual marriage between to 
rival state-supported schools. 

The brainchild of former 
Purdue University trustee, Alfred 
W. Kettler, Sr., IPFW was the 
first school in the U.S. to be part of 



two separate schools on the same 
location. 

Kettler, who has been honored 
by having the school's initial 
building in his name, felt the 
Purdue extension, located at 
Jefferson and Barr streets in 
downtown Fort Wayne, and the 
Indiana University extension, 
located across the alley at 1120 S. 
Barr St., were duplicating func- 
tions. 

During the 1950s, Kettler began 
contacting other trustees from 
both universities and the 
presidents of both universities 
with the idea of building a joint 
campus in Fort Wayne. In 1357, 
acquisition of the land, which 
IPFW currently occupies begaa 



Some of the land was owned by the 
State Hospital, some by the city of 
Fort Wayne' and some by Allen 
County. 

In 1958, the Indiana-Purdue 
Foundation was incorporated to 
provide an independent agency 
for acquisition of land and to 
develop plans for educational 
buildings. The Foundation, which 
still exists today, is made up of 
five members appointed by the IU 
Board of Trustees, five members 
appointed by the Purdue Board of 
Trustees and five members 
representing Fort Wayne. 

In 1961, the Foundation ap- 
proved the location of a building 
and agreed to proceed with 



construction. The original plans 
called for the construction of an 
administration building, two 
classroom buildings and a student 
activities building. The plans were 
later modified to provide for one 
building to share a central lobby 
area. Construction for the 200,000 
square-foot building began Oct. 
18, 1961. It was dedicated Nov. 8, 
1964. 

Since that fateful day in 
November 1964, IPFW has grown 
from infancy and began to walk. 
Three new buildings were added 
in the 1970s. Two new buildings 
were opened in the 1980s. Plans for 
an animal care facility are 
already in the works, as are plans 



for a fine arts center. 

IPFW has been jokingly called 
Harvard on the St. Joe and Bypass 
High. The school's administrators 
and student leaders have tried to 
fight off these nicknames. 
Someday, people won't be calling 
IPFW those names, but rather 
will proudly tell their children, 
"That is where I went to college," 
while driving down Coliseum 
Boulevard. 

IPFW will grow out of its in- 
. fancy and someday take its place 
along side the great institutions in 
the state and then along side the 
great institutions in the country. It 
will take time, after all, IPFW Is 
just learning to walk.

Editor-in-Chief 

Chancellor Joseph P. Giusti, 
saying he "took an offer he 
couldn't refuse," will begin a 
leave of absence Sept. 4. 

Giusti, the chancellor the past 
five years, will coordinate the 
efforts of Indiana President John 
W. Ryan and Purdue President 
Steven C. Beering to convene a 
council of presidents in Indiana 
for direction in lobbying the U.S. 
Congress for reauthorization of 
the Higher Education Ac t of 1965, 



"Indiana is going in with a 
strong, united voice," Giusti said. 
"We will be in a much better 
position to influence Congress" 

Ryan and Beering hope to 
convene a council of the 39 college 
and university presidents in the 
state 

Giusti called the reauthorization 
of the act a "dynamic issue before 
the country. It is the foundation of 
higher education." 

The 1965 act is scheduled to 
expireSept30, 1985. 

In addition to convening the 



council, Giusti will operate an 
office at 1UPUI for the purpose of 
gathering information. 

"We want to have the statistics 
to back up any revisions that may 
be put forth," hesaid. 

During Giusti's absence, 
Edward A. Nicholson, vice 
chancellor for academic affairs, 
will serve as acting chancellor. 

Giusti said he will leave his 
office undisturbed and that he 
plans to return to his job at IPFW 
once his job in Indianapolis is 
completed.

further assist students at IPFW, 

This year's students' govern- 
ment administration under the 
direction of Gorney include Don 
Lee, student body vice-president, 
and Todd Sturgill, student union 
board of governors chairman. 

Chairmen for the committees 
under student senate include 
Maria Pilarski, student affairs 
chairman. The Student Affairs 
Committee is in charge of all 
service functions of the student 
senate. 

Internal affairs chairman is 
Paula Kramer. The Internal 
Affairs Committee is in charge of 
screening all potential student 
government members and in- 
vestigating grievances. ' 

Henry Utermark is the

Gorney has been working on 
student discounts at ap- 
proximately 55 local jewelry, 
food, clothes, shoe and hardware 
stores. The discounts range from

building on campus. 

The first student senate meeting 
is tentatively scheduled for Aug. 
29 at7 p.m. in room 227 of the Walb 
Memorial Union. All students are 
invited to attend.

New parking lot 
to open at IPFW 



ByMIKEROEGER 
Editor-lii -Chief 

A 280-stall parking lot is ex- 
pected to open on IPFW's north- 
east side during the first week of 
classes. 

The lot, located near the 
Multipurpose Building, is ex- 
pected to prevent the parking 
problems which occurred last fall 
at IPFW. 

Last fall, from the beginning of 
the semester until mid-October, 
200 to 300 cars were parked 
illegally every day. In October, a 
temporary lot was built near the 
St. Joseph River. That lot will 
remain open throughout the year. 

With the addition of the new lot, 
John Carnaghi, vice chancellor 
for financial affairs, said there 



will be 120-125 excess stalls if the 
university has no growth in 
student population. 

"It's a natural spot for a lot," 
Carnaghi said. With anticipated 
campus expansion in that 
direction and anticipated larger 
crowds at athletic events, the lot 
will alleviate potential future 
problems. 

The temporary lot, located on 
the campus' southwest corner, 
will remain open to the public 
until a study is completed 
regarding the future of IPFW. 

The study was initiated by the 
Fort Wayne Faculty Senate last 
fall as to where academic growth 
will take place. When the study is 
completed, a decision on the 
temporary lot will be made.

NCATE endorses 
education division 



The National Council for 
Accreditation of Teacher 
Education has granted initial 
accreditation to IPFW's education 
programs. 

The accreditation marks the 
first time NCATE has endorsed 
IPFW's division of education 
separately, not as part of a multi- 
campus system. 

Approved at the council's June 
meeting in Chicago, the ac- 
creditation extends through Sept. 
1, 1990, and covers all of the 
division of education's programs. 
The decision climaxes a two-year 
effort by the campus to regain 
accreditation which it, along with 
IU Southeast, had lost in a 1982 
review of the IU's systemwide 
School of Education. 

"We're delighted because of 
what this means not only to IPFW 
but, even more importantly, to 



students' perception of our 
programs," said Kenneth Keller, 
acting chair of the division of 
education. 

The campus asked for the 
NCATE review, having completed 
on schedule its plan to meet

Athletic program grows stronger 



People have often overlooked 
the rapid growth of IPFW 
athletics. 

A little over two years ago, the 
IPFW athletic department con- 
sisted of one full-time and one 
part-time staff member in an 
office in Walb Memorial Union. 
IPFW's various teams usually 
posted mediocre records and had 
to play away from campus. 

A major commitment to a 
strong athletic program by IPFW 
has changed all of this 
dramatically. The construction of 
the multipurpose building and the 
soccer and baseball fields gave 
the Mastodon teams a home for 
the first time. 

The move into NCAA Division n 
and acceptance In the Great 
Lakes Valley Conference has 
given the Mastodons a stronger 
schedule and more credibility. 
The athletics staff has expanded 
to six full-time administrators and 
coaches, three full-time 



secretaries and several talented 
part-time coaches and staffers. 

Perhaps the most obvious 
change has been with the success 
of IPFW's teams. Even with the 
move into tougher Division II 
competition, best-ever records 
have been established by several 
Mastodon teams. 

From a 2-24 record two years 
ago, head coach Tim Russell has 
guided the men's basketball team 
to last season's best-ever 13-10 
record. The team narrowly 
missed a berth in the NCAA 
Division II tournament last 
spring. 

This season looks bright for the 
men's team. Graduating only Rob 
Henderson from the team, the 
signing of Richard Ivy from 
Muncie Northside and David 
Lutes from Hammond Bishop Noll 
should strengthen an already 
tough squad that features the likes 
of leading scorers Jeff Fullove 
and Mark Cook. 



Sports announcements 



Any IPFW student interested in 
playing on the IPFW men's or 
women's tennis teams should 
contact coach Tim Sullivan at the 
Fort Wayne Racquet Club. 



Any IPFW student interested in 
playing on the women's softball 
team should contact coach 
DianeThomas in the Multipurpose 

Building. 



Any IPFW student interested in 
trying out for the cheerleading 
squad should contact David 
Skelton, athletic director, in the 
Multipurpose Building or Vicki 
Vorndran, cheerleader sponsor, in 
room 235 of the Walb Memorial 
Union. The squad is open to both 
male and female students. A 
meeting will take place Aug. 30 at 
4 p.m. in the gymnasium in the 
Multipurpose Building.

THANK YOU 



TO THE STAFF AND STUDENTS OF 
INDIANA-PURDUE UNIVERSITY 
FORT WAYNE. ARA SERVICES 
WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR 
YOUR PAST PATRONAGE THE LAST 
FOUR YEARS. 

WE HOPE TO AGAIN HAVE THE 
PRIVILEGE OF SERVING YOU IN 
FUTURE YEARS. 



The women's basketball squad 
has gained maturity and ex- 
perience after a 12-14 season 
competing against Division 1! 
competition last season for the 
first time. Head coach Kirk 
Kavanaugh made significant 
advances by recruiting Snider's 
Becky Patterson, Elmhurst's Lori 
Miller, Northrop's Lisa Zehr and 
Bishop Dwenge Chris Bonahoom. 

Volleyball coach Arnie Ball 
continues his strong women's 
volleyball program with the 
signing of three of the area's finest 
athletes: Carla Gerard ot and 
Julie Hefty of North Side, and 
Concordia's Dawn Bohnke. Last 
season, the women rolled to a 
best-ever 35-16 record and also 



defeated several Division I op- 
ponents. 

The men's volleyball team 
posted the most wins in a season 
with a 21-13 record last spring. 
Continued achievement is ex- 
pected since the team lost only 
two starters from last season. 

Terry Stefankiewicz's soccer 
team is nothing less than a win- 
ner. Last season's best-ever 
record of 12-4-1 makes six straight 
winning seasons for the squad. 
Victories over Notre Dame and 
DePaul highlighted last year's 
action. With the exception of 
graduate Tony Davis, the soccer 
team will return a strong roster of 
veterans to the 1984 season. 

The baseball team which 
struggled to an 8-15 record last 



spring, is looking ahead to better 
days under second year coach Lee 
DeTurk. DeTurk is working 
diligently to establish some 
continuity in the baseball 
program, which will be beneficial 
in maintaining winning ball clubs. 

Two new coaches have joined 
D?FW this season. Coaching cross 
country this season will be 
veteran Northrop coach Barrie 
Peterson and coaching golf will be 
former Snider mentor, Don 
Bruick. 

Both IPFW men's and women's 
tennis teams should continue their 
winning ways through their 1984 
and 1985 seasons. Coach Tim 
Sullivan, a tennis pro at the Fort 
Wayne Racquet Club, will con- 
tinue to lead the teams.

Is your calculator in the same 
class you are? 

Move up to theTI-66.The easy 512 step programmable. 



You're into higher math and your old calculator 
helped get you there. 

But now it's time for something more. The 
Tl-66 from Texas Instruments. The Tl-66 offers 
full programming power and flexibility so you can 
solve complex and repetitive math problems 
quickly, easily and with fewer keystrokes than 
you thought possible. Its 512 merged program 
steps and over 170 built-in scientific, engineer- 
ing and statistical functions make for powerful 
programmfng. And the sleek, streamlined design 
makes for easy use. 

Its Algebraic Operating System makes it easy 
on your brain by allowing you to key in problems 
as they are written, left to right. And a 10-digit 
angled Liquid Crystal Display not only makes it 



easy on your eyes but provides alphanumeric 
notation of your program steps so you can make 
easy modifications as you go along. 

There are large, readable keys for your fingers, 
and an easy-to-follow guidebook so you shouldn't 
get confused. And last, but certainly not least, at 
a suggested retail of $69.95, there's a price that's 
easy on your pocketbook. 

All in all, if we made the TI-66 programmable 
calculator any easier to use, it would deserve its 
own degree. 1 * _

PAGE 2 - THE STUDENTS' HANDBOOK — AUGUST 20,1964 



Chancellor Giusti welcomes IPF W's new students 




Some of you are nervous newcomers who are enrolling in 
cHlege-credit courses for the first time. Others are more 
confident as you return to continue your education at [PFW . 
Still others are matter-of-fact old-timers who perhaps will be 
receiving degrees this year. But despite the differences in 
your approach to registration (ranging from timidity to 
bravado), anticipation is there: anticipation of what is to 
come in the months ahead. 

As chancellor for the past five years, I have seen many 
positive changes take place on our campus. You old-timers 
can probably recount the improvements better than I, since 
the new buildings that have been added, the removal of the 
temporary structures and their replacement with the 
geogarden, the cultural additions that have enhanced the 
collegiate atmosphere, the library endowment, new degree 
programs, and other opportunities for learning have directly 
affected your education. 

What is in store for the 1984-85 academic year? Better 
computer facilities, additional parking, continuing progress 
toward the construction of an animal-care facility, 
renovations to the ground level of Kettler Hall, a change in 
the food service supplier, anticipated forward movement 
toward a new fine arts complex on the Coliseum Boulevard 



campus, and the addition of a new teaching tool in the way of 
an artifacts display in the main lobby of Kettler are among 
anticipated improvements. But most importantly, what is in 
store for you is the opportunity to progress toward your 
personal and professional goals under the guidance of highly 
qualified counselors and advisors, a distinguished staff of 
instructors and support personnel, and an administrative 
staff that is continually working toward an improved IPFW. 
To each newcomer, I extend a welcome on behalf of the 
campus community. Please take advantage of every op- 
portunity offered to you, add your own serious efforts, and be 
assured you have our support. 

To those who are returning to campus, welcome back. 1 
hope that you will share the experiences you have gained 
here with those who are new to the campus or are con- 
sidering enrollment You are looked to tor leadership in 
campus activities. Assume responsibility, become involved, 
and I am sure you will find that it is your own education that 
will benefit the most from that involvement. 

Together, you can ensure that 1984 will be another great 
year for IPFW. 

JosephP. Giusti 
Chancellor 



Classes And Grades 



ATTENDING CLASSES 

1. Is regular class attendance required? 

Yes. Although the method of recording attendance may 
vary from class to class, students are expected to attend 
every class meeting for which they are enrolled. 

2. What should I do if I am unable to attend a class? 
Contact the professor as soon as possible to make 

arrangements for make-up work, if such work is permitted. 
The only acceptable excuses for absence are generally 
related to illness and family emergency situations. Missing 
classes may seriously reduce the quality of your work and 
result in a poor grade. 

SCHEDULE ADJUSTMENT 

3. Can I drop classes any time I want to? 

No. A class cannot be dropped during the last four weeks 
of the semester or the last two weeks of a summer session. 

4. How do 1 drop a class? 

First you must get a drop-add form from your advisor. 
During the first 10 weeks of classes, that is all you must 
submit to the registrar's office to officially drop the class. 
During the 11th and 12th weeks, the instructor and your 
academic dean must also approve each class to be dropped, 
and they will do so only in unusual circumstances. 

5. Can I add a class to my schedule after I have 
registered? 

Yes. Classes may be added with approval from your ad- 
visor during the first week of classes. The instructor of each 
class must approve additions after that time. 

6. If 1 want to quit school before classes are over, what do 
I have to do? 

Follow the procedure described for dropping a class. Not 
attending class is not the same as withdrawal. Students who 
do not withdraw properly from a course will receive a 
falling grade. 

CHANGING MAJORS 

7. Can 1 change my major if I change my mind about what 
I want to study? 

Yes. However you should contact the department that 
offers your new major. A change form will be sent to your 
department and to the registrar's office. 
GRADES 

8. What kind of grades are given credit courses? 
A full list of grades appears in the IPFW Bulletin. 

CLASSES AND GRADES: 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 

9. What is the "Pass-Fail Option" for a grade in class? 
This is an opportunity for you to take some courses 

without affecting your GPA. However, unsatisfactory work 
may count as an F in your GPA. You must have an ad- 
visor's permission to take a course under this option. 

10. What does it mean if I get a grade of "I", incomplete'' 
The grade of "I" means that you could not complete all 

requirements for the course by the end of the semester and 
that you and the instructor have agreed on a method to 
finish those requirements. You must remember that if the 
First, all grades that you have earned at this campus will 
be averaged together. Generally, the first semester that 
requirements are not met by the appropriate deadline, that 
incomplete "I" grade will become an "F" failing grade. 

11. If my grades are bad, will I be able to continue in 
school? 



this average is below the university's or school's minimum 
requirement you will only be placed on probation, which 
means that you will be given an opportunity to raise your 
GPA through additional classes the next time you enroll. If 
you then continue with poor grades, you will be subject to 
dismissal from the university. 

12. If I am dismissed from the university, will I ever be 
permitted to return? 

Generally a student may request to be readmitted to the 
university after being out of school for one semester. Once 
the readmission is approved, the student will be able to 
enroll but will again be placed on probation until the 
minimum GPA has been achieved. The request for read- 
mission must generally be submitted one month before the 
start of that semester. 

OTHER ACADEMIC 
MATTERS 

13. Under what conditions am I considered to be a student 
in good standing? 

You are considered to be in good standing if not 
dismissed, suspended, dropped from the university without 
being readmitted, or on probation. 

14. What conditions will deny me the opportunity to 
register for classes? 

The most common reason is that you owe money to the 
university. If you are a student in good standing, other 
reasons would include misconduct and violation of any 
rules adopted and made public by the trustees. 

15. If I feel that I have not been treated fairly with regard 
to a grade I received or an assignment I completed, what 
can I do about it? 

You have the right to request that the situation be 
reviewed in a process called a grade appeal. For in- 
formation regarding such procedures, contact the chair of 
the department responsible for teaching the course. 

16. Can I transfer from the Fort Wayne campus to another 
school? 

Yes. However, any student who intends to transfer should 
consult with her or his advisor to make proper 
arrangements well in advance of the intended time of 
transfer. 



CLASSES AND GRADES 

17. What is plagiarism? 

Plagiarism is claiming the work of someone else as if it 
were your own original work. Plagiarism usually occurs, 
when a student writes a paper, submits a project, or 
prepares a collection and includes quotes or Ideas from 
another source without acknowledgement It is serious 
violation and can lead to disciplinary action. 



NONDISCRIMINATION 

IPFW is an equal access-equal opportunity university. No 
qualified person will be denied admission or employment, 
nor will any student or employee be subjected to 
discriminatory treatment or be excluded from par- 
ticipation in any educational program or activity, on the 
basis of race, religion, color, sex, age, national origin, 
handicap, or status as a disabled or Vietnam Era veteran. 
Further information is available from the affirmative 
action officer (482-5434) . 



NON-HARASSMENT 

IPFW strives to maintain the campus as a place where 
students may study and work free of sexual harassment and 
harassment on the basis ot race, color, religion, national 
origin, or other protected status. Students should he aware

table conduct and will not be condoned. If you have a ques- 
tion or a complaint, or want advice, you may talk with no of

National Student exchange 

An exciting opportunity awaits students through the 
National Student Exchange program. Have you ever 
dreamed of going to school in Montana, New Mexico, South 
Carolina, Wisconsin, or perhaps even Hawaii, and not be 
charged out-of-state fees? Your dream could come true by 
participating in the National Student Exchange. 

The NSE provides the opportunity for IPFW students to 
spend a year of study in residence at a member institution 
during their sophomore or junior years. Participating 
students remain enrolled at IPFW while on exchange, and 
credit earned on exchange is recorded as regular degree 
credit. It is an ideal way for students to broaden cultural 
and educational horizons while progressing toward then- 
local degree objectives. 

If the National Student Exchange sounds exciting and 
interesting to you, stop by Kettler HOE and ask for more 
details.

Grade appeals procedure 

The Faculty Senate has passed a uniform grade appeal 
policy for the B?FW campus. Until this document has been 
approved by the Boards of Trustees, the following 
procedure should be followed by a student who has evidence 
or believes that evidence exists to show that an inap- 
propriate grade has been assigned as a result of prejudice, 
caprice, or other improper conditions such as mechanical 
error or assignment of a grade inconsistent with those 
assigned other students. Additionally, a student may 
challenge the reduction of a grade for alleged scholastic 
dishonesty. Further details on grade appeals appear in this 
"Handbook's" discussion of the Indiana University and 
Purdue University Student Conduct Codes. Those 
statements take precedence over statements below. 

In appealing a grade the burden of proof is on the 
student, except in the case of the alleged academic 
dishonesty, where the instructor must support the 
allegation. 

Informal attempts must be made to resolve grade 
grievances and appeals at the lowest level. If the grievance 
in question cannot be resolved during a conference with 
your instructor, you should speak to the department chair. 

Further appeals will be heard by departmental com- 
mittees or by department chairs. 

Cases not resolved at this level should be referred to the 
school-divisional dean or coordinator. Informal school- 
divisional boards or committees may be established to 
assist deans and coordinators in mediating student 
grievances. Unresolved appeals from this level should be 
directed to the vice chancellor and dean of the faculty, who 
may make a final written decision on academic grade 
appeals after ascertaining that all previous means of ap- 
peal have been duly pursued by all parties involved. 



Transitional studies 

On the way to a degree, you may need some help. 
Transitional studies can make the critical difference. 

The Developmental Skills Center i Kettler 118) offers you 
free help in developing reading, writing, math, and study 
skills (note-taking, textbook-reading, test-taking) on a 
drop-in basis, day and evening, during the school year. 

You. can find in the Developmental Skills Center free 
tutorial help in some introductory courses. Wealso attempt 
to match people needing tutorial help in advanced courses 
with available tutors; financial arrangements for this 
tutoring must be made by students and tutors involved. 

Credit course work is offered in individualized sections of 
English W130 (Principles of Composition) ; Education X150 
(Reading-Learning Techniques I, a reading-study skills 
course; Education X151 (Reading - Learning Techniques 
II) , a study-skills course which emphasizes the application 
of study skills to real college courses ; and selected sections 
of Math 111, which maintain a smaller than average 
student-teacher ratio. 

The RAP (Returning Adult Place) program is for 
students coming to the university after being out of school 
for one or more years. RAP features a free monthly 
newsletter on university services and procedures, and 
meetings dedicated to improving students' study or per- 
sonal skills. To get the newsletter and meeting information, 
stop in Kettler 118, or call us at 482-5655. 



Housing information 

No housing facilities are on the IPFW campus. However, 
the student activities office (482-5616) dispenses housing 
information upon request. There are dormitory facilities 
available for men and women at nearby Concordia 
Theological Seminary, and dormitory-type facilities 
available for women only at the YVVCA. The student ac- 
tivities office does not approve or disapprove housing; it 
merely serves as a clearinghouse for housing information. 

Financial aid 

Financial aid helps students finance their college 
education. The financial aid office (482-5641) uses grants 
and scholarships, loans, and part-time employment, either 
singly or in combination, as the means to provide this 
assistance. 

Even though most aid is restricted to full-time un- 
dergraduate students, some programs are available for 
part-time and graduate students. You must file an IPFW 
financial aid application and a Financial Aid Form (FAF) 
to be considered. The applications are reviewed con- 
fidentially by a financial aid counselor, and your aid award 
is based on the calculated need and the availability of funds. 

You are urged to apply by March 1 for the following 
academic year. Applications are accepted after that date, 
but late filers run the risk of encountering fund shortages. 
Also, early application assures that your forms will be 
processed in time for fall registration. 

The financial aid office, located in Kettler 109, has a staff 
of trained counselors to assist with the application process. 
The regular office hours are 8 am. to 6 p.m. Monday 
through Thursday, and 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday. If 
necessary, appointments may be made for other times. 



Veterans' services 



Your GI Bill education benefits can be used at IPFW. The 
veterans' services office in Kettler 107 will help you apply 
for aid. Usually, the only form you should bring is your 
discharge paper ( DD214) . 

Normal processing time for a new application is 45-60 
days. 

The Vet-Rep-On-Campus has information dealing with all 
phases of veterans' benefits, or can refer you to the proper 
community agencies.

A warm welcome to all new students, and to returning

some extra time to get involved with campus activities.

many other activities at IPFW.

Students' Government is the official voice of the student

the Student Senate and the Student Union Board of Gover- 
nors. The Student Senate is the legislative branch of 
Students' Government which handles: student concerns, 
improving university policy, lobbying for students, and 
allocation of student service fee monies. The Student Union 
Board of Governors is the cultural and activity branch of 
Students' Government which plans: the weekly movie 
series, parties, dances, trips (including the Florida Spring 
Break trip), lectures, and concerts. Both branches of 
Students' Government are always interested in new 
members. We are located in room 225 of the Union Building.

PAGE B - THE STUDENTS' HANDBOOK — AUGUST 20. 1964 



A Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities 
(Indiana University) 



SECTION I. STUDENT RIGHTS 
AND RESPONSIBILITIES 

1.1 Students should have accurate and plainly stated 
information relating to the maintenance of acceptable 
academic standing, graduation requirements, and in- 
dividualcourseobjectivesand requirements (see thelPFW 
Bulletin). 

1.2 Student records will be maintained in keeping with the 
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, further 
amendments and the HEW guidelines for implementation. 

1.3 In all academic evaluations, and in instances of 
academic discipline, the student has the right to fair and 
impartial treatment. 

1.4 

(a&gt; Students may establish, issue, and distribute — 
consistent with appropriate regulations concerning the 
time, place, and manner of distribution — student-directed 
publications which are in no way published under the 
auspices of the university and are published without any 
financial support from the university. Such regulations 
shall not be designed to restrict student access to these 
publications on university property 

(b) Student-directed publications which are published 
under university auspices shall be free of censorship. The 
university shall honor this freedom by publicly recognizing 
and protecting the student editors' and managers' right to 
establish editorial policies — within the bounds of 
prevailing legal standards and standards of journalism. 
Specifically, student editors or managers may not be 
suspended or removed In response to pressure by external 
groups disagreeing with their editorial policies. 

1.5 Students have the right to freedom from unlawful 
discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or 
national origin. 

1.6 Students shall have the opportunity to participate in 
the formulation of policy directly affecting students 
through membership on appropriate committees as 
determined by the chancellor and the president of the 
university. 

1.7 Students should be free from illegal searches and 
seizures. 

1.8 

(a) The university will not interfere with the rights of 
students to join associations which promote their common 
interests as students. 

(b) Student organizations holding a fiscal-legal 
relationship with the university are subject to university 
policies, procedures, and regulations pertaining to such 
organizations. 

1.9 

la) Indiana University considers freedom of inquiry and 
discussion essential to a student's educational develop- 
ment. Thus, the university recognizes the right of all 
students to engage in discussion, to exchange thought and 
opinion, and to speak, write, or print freely on any subject, 
in accordance with the guarantees of federal and state 
constitutions. This broad principle is a cornerstone of 
education in a democracy. 

(b) For their programs student groups on the campus 
may freely select persons they wish to invite as guest 

'speakers or performers. There are no restrictions on the 
point of view expressed by speakers other than those im- 
posed by national or state law. The invitation to an outside 
speaker does not imply approval or sponsorship of the 
speaker's views by the university nor by the group inviting 
the speaker. 

(c) University facilities are designed to accommodate toe 
scheduled activities of the university, to accommodate the 
extracurricular activities of student groups, and to ac- 
commodate visitors and guests of the university. From 
time to time, as extraordinary requests may justify, 
facilities may be made available for programs of various 
kinds sponsored by non-university groups, especially for 
charitable or civic purposes. 

(d) The university does not make its facilities available 
for fund-raising purposes if the funds are designated to 
enrich an individual or commercial sponsor. 

(e) The university's facilities ordinarily will be 
unavailable for the purpose of providing entertainment of a 
kind that is available in the outside community and is 
competitive with it. 

(f) The university reserves the right to control its 
facilities to assure that events held are compatible with its 
prime purpose of serving the university community by 
making available to it programs that appear to enhance its 
cultural and educational opportunities. 

(g) The university will at all times seek to assure student 
and faculty groups the opportunity to meet and to hear and 
exchange ideas and views, however controversial, but it 
does not license and will not tolerate what is illegal. 

1.10 Students are free to engage in peaceful and orderly 
protest, demonstration, and picketing which does not 
disrupt functions of the university. 

1.11 Students have the right to freely exercise their full 



rights as citizens. In this light, the university affirms the 
right to students to exercise their freedoms without 
university interference or fear of university sanction for 
such activity. 

1.12 As members of the academic community, students 
have an obligation to that community and to the preser- 
vation of the academic process. As citizens, students have 
the responsibility to know and obey the laws of the United 
States, the State of Indiana, and of local governments. 
Student status in no way exempts them from the 
requirements of obeying such laws. 

1.13 

I a ) The fallowing actions constitute misconduct for which 
students may be penalized, by such sanctions as described 
in 1.13 (c), when committed on university property:

(5) Use of, or threatened use of physical force or 
violence to restrict the freedom of any person, or acting

conduct occurs on university property or in the course of a 
university activity. 

(6) Initiation or circulation of a report or warning of an 
impending bombing, false alarm of fire, or other crime, 
emergency, or catastrophe, knowing that the report is

fire, or that a bomb or other explosive has been placed in 
any university building or elsewhere on university 
property. 

(7) Failure to comply with the directions of university 
officials and their authorized agents acting in the per-

. (12) Possession or use of illegal drugs. 

(13) Intentional damage to or destruction of university

(b) Actions not committed on university property may 
also be subject to penalties, provided that the offense 
relates to the security of the university community or the 
integrity of the educational process ( e.g., rape, arson, fraud 
...). 

(c) The scope of disciplinary sanctions which may be 
imposed on students is as follows: reprimand; disciplinary 
probation; expulsion from university housing; suspension 
or expulsion from the university. In addition, academic 
misconduct may be punished by an academic sanction in 
the course in which the misconduct occurred. 

(d) The process for imposing academic and-or 
disciplinary sanctions shall be designed to accord students 
the guarantees of due process and procedural fairness. 

(c) The university undertakes to ensure equal treatment 
of students subject to disciplinary or academic sanctions, 
and to impose similar sanctions for similar misconduct; 
provided, that the student's prior conduct record, if any. 
will be taken into consideration.

failure to be inexcusable, impose any of the discipLnary 
penalties described under Section I, paragraph 1.13 (c). 

(7) That many disciplinary penalties imposed under the 
circumstances noted in paragraph (6) above shall be 
subject to further hearing or appeal, but the fact of the 
student's failure to appear at the conference, if unjustified, 
may be weighed as a factor in future hearings. 

2.3 Student's Response to Charge: Disposition Without 
Hearing 

(a) When the student appears as required, the dean shall 
inform the student as fully as possible of the facts alleged. 
The student may, but need not, make responses and ex- 
planations. 

(b) If, after discussion and such further investigation as 
may be necessary, the dean determines that the violation 
alleged is not supported by the evidence, the dean shall 
dismiss the accusation and notify the student. 

&lt;c) If, after discussion, or if the student fails to appear, 
and if the dean is satisfied that the violation occurred as 
alleged, the dean shall so notify the student and shall 
propose a penalty by means of a written notice. The 
student, by such notice, shall be offered the choice either of 
consenting to the determination and proposed penalty or of 
requesting a hearing before a hearing commission. Should 
a student desire a hearing before a hearing commission, the 
request shall be made in writing and delivered to the dean 
on or before a date specified in the notice that proposes the 
penalty, which shall be a date no earlier than seven days 
after its mailing. 

(d) If no written choice is received by the dean within the 
time specified, no hearing shall be held, the punishment 
proposed by the dean shall be imposed, and the action shall 
be considered final. 

2.4 Hearing 

(a) If a student requests a bearing, the dean shall make 
arrangements for the hearing; but thereafter, with notice to 
the student, the dean may request the hearing commission 
(see 2.4 lb)) to dismiss the case. If a hearing is to take 
place, notice from the dean shall be sent by certified mail to 
the student's address as it then appears in the official 
records of the university or shall be delivered personally 
to the student The notice shall Inform the student of the 
following: 

(1) the offense alleged to have been committed, by citing 
the relevant section of this code; 

(2) the date, time, and place of alleged commission, and 
other relevant circumstances, including a summary of the 
evidence upon which the charges are based, the names of 
those who may be presented as witnesses and-or whose 
statements would be offered as evidence at the hearing; 

(3) the date, time, and place of the hearing, which shall 
not be earlier than ten days after the date of the notice; 

(4) that the student is entitled to be present with counsel 
or an advisor of his-her choice and to present witnesses and 
to cross-examine witnesses who appear; 

&lt;5) that the university may also be represented by legal 
counsel if it so elects; 
(6) that the student need not answer questions, and that a 
(Continued on page 9) 



(Continued from page Hi 
choice to remain silent will not be taken as an admission of 
guilt; 

(7) the penalties that may be imposed by the hearing 
commission; 

(8) that the hearing will be closed to the public, unless the 
student indicates in writing to the dean, at least five days in 
advance of the hearing, a desire to open the hearing to the 
public. The dean and the presiding officer of the hearing 
commission shall make arrangements satisfactory to the 
hearing commission to accommodate observers if a 
hearing is to be public, and the hearing commission's 
choice of place and determination of the number of ob- 
servers that can be conveniently accommodated is final; 

&lt;9) that the failure to appear at the hearing will be action 
for which the hearing commission could impose any 
disciplinary sanction without right of further appeal if the 
hearing commission, upon diligent inquiry, finds such 
failure to be inexcusable. 

&lt;b) A hearing shall be conducted before a hearing 
commission, appointed by the chancellor, which shall 
consist of three members: one student and two faculty 
members, one of the faculty to serve also as the presiding 
officer of the commission. Each hearing commission shall 
be constituted from a list of: 

lit ten or more students appointed by the student body 
president upon recommendation of the student assembly or 
other appropriate representative body. 

(21 ten or more faculty members (to be representative of 
the various academic disciplines) to be appointed by the 
chancellor. 

(c) If any vacancy on the hearing list occurs because of 
the failure or refusal of the appropriate authorities to make 
recommendations to fill vacancies, the chancellor may 
make appointments, fill vacancies, or take such other 
action as is necessary to constitute the hearing list or any 
hearing commission. The members of the hearing com- 
mission shall hold office from the first day of the fall 
semester for a term of one year, but they shall complete the 
hearing of any case they have begun to consider. Members 
may be reappointed. 

(dt No hearing shall be held unless all members of the 
hearing commission are present. If any member of a 
hearing commission is unable to serve or should be excused 
from serving, another commission member shall be 
selected from the hearing list 

(c) The presiding officer, in consultation with other 
members, shall maintain necessary order and shall make 
all rulings necessary for the fair, orderly, and expeditious 
conduct of the hearing. The hearing commission may 
examine all witnesses. When it appears necessary to avoid 
undue hardship or to avoid injustice, the hearing com- 
mission may, in its discretion, grant a reasonable con- 
tinuance of the hearing. The hearing commission shall 
provide a taped transcript of all proceedings, which 
transcript shall be maintained for a period of one year. 

(f) Copies of all communications pertaining to the alleged 
offense from the dean of student services to a student whose 
case is pending shall be sent to the presiding officer. The 
dean of student services bringing charges and the student, 
or the student's advisor or other counsel, may present and 
examine witnesses, present other evidence, and may cross- 
examine witnesses. The student charged with an offense 
may testify, but shall not be ordered to testify by the 
hearing commission, nor shall failure to testify be con- 
sidered an admission of guilt. The burden of proving that 
the student has committed the offense or offenses as 
charged shall be upon the university. 

(g) The decision of the hearing commission shall be solely 
based upon matters introduced at the hearing and must be 
based upon substantial and convincing evidence. A decision 
shall be made by majority vote only, with all members of 
the commission voting. 



(h) The hearing commission shall make a finding 
whether the student has committed the offense (s), it shall, 
after a review of any disciplinary record the student may 
have, impose one of the disciplinary penalties enumerated 
under Section I, 1.13 (c), of this code. 

(i) Within ten days after the conclusion of the hearing, the 
hearing commission shall render a written decision and 
include a brief explanation of the decision and set forth the 
findings of fact upon which the decision is made. The 
hearing commission shall promptly furnish copies of its 
decision to the student and the dean. 

2.5 Appeal 

(a) The student or the dean may appeal the decision of the 
hearing commission to the review board established by 
paragraph 2.5 (c) below. An appeal may be initiated by 
filing a notice of appeal with the dean, including a 
memorandum stating the reason(s) for believing the 
decision improper, not later than seven days after the date 
of the written decision of the hearing commission, and the 
dean shall immediately forward the notice to the presiding 
officer of the review board and the student involved (if 
necessary). 

(b) The student shall be notified by the dean: 

(1) of the date, time, and place of the appeal hearing; 

(2) that either may submit written statements to the 
review board and to one another, before the appeal 
hearing; 

(3) that, at the hearing, either may make oral arguments 
based on the record to the review board, or that the 
respective advisor or other counsel may do so; 

(4) that the appeal hearing will be closed to the public, 
unless otherwise requested by the student at least five days 
before the hearing; 

(5) that the review board will not accept additional 
evidence, but will consider only the record of the previous 
hearing. 

(c) The review board shall be composed of a student 
appointed by the appropriate president of the student body, 
a faculty member appointed by the Fort Wayne (Faculty) 
Senate, and an administrative officer appointed by the chief 
administrative officer of a campus. The administrative 
member shall serve as chair. 

(d) The members of the review board shall hold office 
from the first day of the fall semester for a term of one 
year, but they shall complete the review of any case which 
they have begun to consider. No member may serve more 
than two consecutive terms. If any vacancy on the review 
board occurs because of the failure or refusal of ap- 
propriate authorities to make recommendations to fill 
vacancies, the chancellor may make appointments to fill 
vacancies, or take such other action necessary to constitute 
the review board. 

(e) No hearing shall be held unless all members of the 
review board are present. If any member of the review 
board is unable to serve or should excuse himself herself 
from serving, another review board member shall be ap- 
pointed in accordance with the provisions of sections (c) 
and (d) above. 

(f) The presiding officer of the review board, in con- 
sultation with other members, shall maintain necessary 
order and shall make all rulings necessary for the fair, 
orderly, and expeditious conduct of the appeal hearing. 
Decisions by the review board shall be by majority vote 
only. 

(g) The review board will listen to the recorded tape of 
the hearing commission, and then on the basis of that and 
oral arguments, written statements, and a review of the 
evidence presented at the appeal bearing, the review board 
must render a decision within twenty days of the hearing 
and may: 

(1) Affirm the original decision which shall be effective 
as of the date specified by the hearing commission. 

(2) Affirm the original decision (and reduce penalty) 



AUGUST20, 1984 -THE STUDENTS' HANDBOOK -PAGE 9 
which shall be effective as of the date specified by the 
hearing commission. 

(3) Reverse the decision. 

(4) Disallow the decision and order a new hearing. 

(h) The decision of the review board shall be sent to the 
dean, who shall notify the student and proceed ap- 
propriately. 

2.6 Failure to Appear 

If a student notified to appear before the dean or before a 
hearing commission fails to comply and if the dean or the 
hearing commission reasonably believes that the violation 
occurred as alleged, the dean or the hearing commission 
shall so notify the student and shall propose an appropriate 
sanction by means of written notice. When an extension of 
time appears necessary to avoid undue hardship or in- 
justice, the dean may extend the time to enable a student to 
respond to an accusation or prepare a defense. 

2.7 Summary Action 

Summary suspension of a student and exclusion from 
university property may be imposed without the hearing 
procedure provided for in this Section, but only by the 
president of the university upon the recommendation of the 
chancellor. The president shall first be satisfied that the 
continued status as a student upon the campus seriously 
threatens harm to the student or to any other person or the 
property of the university or of others. A student so 
suspended may be required to leave the property of the 
university and may be notified that he-she will thereafter be 
treated as a trespasser if he-she returns. A student notified 
of such a suspension may, within ten days after receipt of 
such notice, request a hearing before a hearing com- 
mission, as provided in this Section, to determine whether 
the summary suspension is justified or whether the person 
should be reinstated. 

2.8 Whenever disciplinary action is initiated by the dean 
against a student under the age of eighteen, the dean shall 
make reasonable efforts to assure that the parent(s) or, 
where applicable, other legal guardian of the student is 
notified that the action is pending. 

SECTION III. ACADEMIC DUE PROCESS 

Preamble 

Faculty and students alike have rights and respon- 
sibilities for learning, teaching, and scholarship within the 
entire university community. Academic functions are 
characterized by reasoned discourse, intellectual honesty, 
mutual respect, and openness to constructive change. In- 
dividuals must remain active in avoiding violations of 
academic ethics. 

3.1 Definitions of Academic Misconduct; Student 
Misconduct 

(a) Cheating — Dishonesty of any kind with respect to 
examinations, course assignments, alteration of records, or 
illegal possession of examinations shall be considered 
cheating. 

It is the responsibility of the student not only to abstain 
from cheating but, in addition, to guard against making it 
possible for others to cheat. Any student who helps another 
student to cheat is as guilty of cheating as the student he or 
she assists. The student should also do everything possible 
to induce respect for the examining process and for honesty 
in the performance of assigned tasks in or out of class. 

(b) Plagiarism — Honesty requires that any ideas or 
materials taken from another source for either written or 
oral use must be fully acknowledged. Offering the work of 
someone else as one's own is plagiarism. The language or 
ideas thus taken from another may range from isolated 
formulas, sentences, or paragraphs to entire articles copied 
from books, periodicals, speeches, or the writings of other 
students. The offering of materials assembled or collected 
by others in the form of projects or collections without 
acknowledgment also is considered plagiarism. Any

3.2 Faculty Responsibilities 

The faculty and the trustees of Indiana University have 
affirmed specific responsibilities of academic appointees. 
These responsibilities are contained in the Code of 
Academic Ethics which is included in the Indiana 
University Academic Handbook. The Code of Academic 
Ethics also provides procedures for enforcement of these 
responsibilities. These responsibilities include, among 
others: 

(1) A teacher will maintain a clear connection between 
the advance description and Ihe conduct and content of 
each course presented to ensure efficient subject selection 
by students. 

(21 A teacher will clearly state the course goals and will 
inform students of testing and grading systems; moreover, 
these systems should be intellectually justifiable and 
consistent with the rules and regulations of the academic 
division. 

(3) A teacher will plan and regulate class time with an 
awareness of its value for every student and will meet 
classes regularly. 

(4) A teacher will remain available to students and will 
announce and keep liberal office hours at hours convenient 
to students. 

(5) A teacher will strive to develop among students 
respect for others and their opinions by demonstrating his 
or her own respect for each student as an individual. 

(6) A teacher will strive to generate a proper respect for 
an understanding of academic freedom by students. At the 
same time a teacher will emphasize high standards and 
strive to protect students from irrelevant and trivial in- 
terruptions or diversions. 

(7) Since letters of evaluation written by a teacher may 
be uniquely important documents in both the academic and 



post-university life of a student, each teacher will strive to 
make such letters both candid and fair. 
3.3 Due Process for Academic Misconduct 

(a) Student Misconduct 
(DA faculty member who has evidence that a student is 

guilty of cheating or plagiarism shall initiate the process of 
determining the student's guilt or innocence. 

(2) No penalty shall be imposed until the student has been 
informed of the charge and of the evidence upon which it is 
based and has been given an opportunity to present his 
defense. 

(3) If the faculty member finds the student guilty, he-she 
will assess a penalty within the class and shall promptly 
report the case in writing to the department chair and the 
academic head of the school or division. The penalty shall 
be in accordance with 3.4, the Actions section of Academic 
Due Process. 

(4) If the faculty member and the student cannot agree on 
the facts pertaining to the charge, or U a student wishes to 
appeal a penalty, the issue may be taken to the department 
chair. Each party will present his-her case to the chair who 
shall then call a meeting of all involved parties. If the issue 
is not resolved in the meeting with the chair, then either 
party may appeal the decision to the academic head of the 
school or division and the decision of the academic head to 
the dean of the faculty who shall convene an ad-hoc all- 
campus joint faculty and student academic review board 
from the appropriate academic disciplines, consisting of 
three faculty members appointed by the faculty Senate and 
two students appointed by the student body president. 

(b) If a student believes that a faculty member has 
violated the Code of Academic Ethics, the student may 
initiate a complaint in accordance with the "Enforcement 
Procedures" specified in the Code of Academic Ethics. 
Such complaints should be brought to the attention of an 
appropriate chair or dean, or to the dean of the faculty or a 
deputy; the dean of the faculty shall provide for con- 
fidential representations regarding such violations. 



3.4 Actions 

( a) A penalty affecting a student's grade in a course may 
be imposed by the faculty member in whose course the 
offense occurred. The faculty member is responsible for 
making proper notification to the department chair con- 
cerned and to the academic bead of the school or division, 
who shall report the action taken to the dean of student 
services for inclusion in a confidential file designed to 
provide a record that will develop information concerning 
students who have repeated offenses. For cases of repeated 
violation, the dean, after appropriate review with the dean 
of the faculty, may initiate disciplinary action. 

(b&gt; In cases of student academic misconduct, the 
following actions are recommended: 

(DA student's grade in a course will be lowered when the 
student is found guilty of dishonesty on any assignment, 
examination, or paper. 

(2) An incomplete may be given in the course in the event 
any case cannot be resolved before final grades are due In 
the registrar's office. 

(3) Upon approval by the academic head of the school or 
division, the student may be transferred from the section in 
which the student is enrolled to another section of the same 
course. 

(4) Cases involving violations of academic ethics outside 
of a class, such as the selling of term papers, must be 
referred to the dean of student services. 

(5) In cases where disciplinary violations under Section I. 
paragraph 13 (a), have occurred simultaneously with 
violations of academic conduct, the Section I of fense will be 
heard according to the procedures in Section II, 
Disciplinary Procedures. 

(6) By a two-thirds vote, the all-campus review board 
(see 3.3 (a) (4)) may recommend to the chancellor that the 
student be dlsenrolled from the academic or professional 
school in which the student is enrolled

PURDUE UNIVERSITY 

REGULATIONS GOVERNING STUDENT 

CONDUCT, DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS, 

AND APPEALS 

A. Authority, Application, Amendment 

1. Authority. These regulations are enacted pursuant to 
the authority conferred by the laws of the State of Indiana 
upon the Board of Trustees of Purdue University to do all 
acts necessary and expedient to put and keep Purdue 
University in operation and to make all rules and 
regulations required or proper to conduct and manage 
Purdue University, and pursuant to the mandate and 
authority of Chapter 273, and Chapter 4444 of the Acts of the 
Indiana General Assembly for the year 1969. 

2. Application. These regulations, as from time to time 
amended, shall apply to all undergraduate and graduate 
students of Purdue University and shall be deemed a part of 
the terms and conditions of the admission and enrollment of 
all students. In case of any conflict or inconsistencies with 
any. other rules, regulations, directives, or policies now 
existing, these regulations shall govern. They shall be 
enforced by the president of the university. 

3. Amendments. These regulations, and any amendments 
hereto, shall take effect on a date prescribed by the Board 
of Trustees and shall remain in effect until rescinded or 
modified by the Board of Trustees. Amendments may be 
proposed at any time by the Purdue Student Association, 
University Senate, administrative staff, or by the Board of 
Trustees. 

4. Adaptation for Regional Campuses. The administrative 
dean for regional campuses is hereby authorized and 
directed to make and promulgate revisions of these 
regulations, as applied to the regional campuses, which are 
necessary because of the different student or faculty 
organizations or governments existing at the regional 
campuses. Such revisions shall be effective when approved 
by the president of the university. 

5. Definitions: 

"University activity" means any teaching research, 
administrative, disciplinary function, proceedings, 
ceremony or activity conducted by or under the authority of 
the university. 

"University property" means property owned, con- 
trolled, used, or occupied by the university. 

"Dean's office" means the dean of student services and 
any associate, assistant, or other person authorized to act 
for them. 

"Administrative action" means the issuance of an oral or 
written warning, admonition, reprimand, and-or use of 
counseling procedures. 

"Disciplinary penalty" means expulsion, suspension, 
disciplinary probation, and other educationally sound 
sanctions. 



"Educationally sound sanctions" means sanctions other 
than disciplinary probation, suspension, probated 
suspension, or expulsion and are limited to the following: 

Restitution — monetary payment for damages and-or 
theft committed in violation of Section B-2-(e). 

Work assignment — assignment of duties to correct 
destructive acts or behavior. 

"Obstruction or disruption of a university activity" 
means any unlawful or objectionable acts or conduct (D 
which seriously threaten the ability of the university to 
maintain its facilities available for performance of its 
educational activities, or (2) which are in violation of the 
reasonable rules and standards of the university designed 
to protect the academic community from unlawful conduct, 
or (3) which present a serious threat to person or property 
of the academic community. Such phrase shall include, 
without limitation of the foregoing general definition, the 
unlawful use of force or violence on or within any buildings 
or grounds owned, used, occupied or controlled by the 
university; using or occupying any such buildings or 
grounds in violation of lawful rules or regulations of the 
university, or for the purpose or with the effect of denying 
or interfering with the lawful use thereof by others; and

the property of the university or the property of others, 
within such buildings and grounds. 

Educationally sound sanctions may be proposed in 
combination with other disciplinary actions. 

"Disciplinary probation" means a probationary student 
status imposed for a limited time as a result of an official 
determination of misconduct. In the event the student is 
found guilty (under the procedures set forth in these 
regulations) of subsequent charges of misconduct com-

sideration in determining the disciplinary penalty, if any, to 
be imposed or the administrative action, if any, to be taken 
because of such subsequent misconduct. 

"Probated suspension" means conditional continuation 
of student status for a limited and defined period of time. 
The student is permitted to retain student status upon the 
condition that the student does not further violate any 
subsection of Section B-2 that would normally result in a 
disciplinary penalty during the time probated suspension is 
in effect. If, during the period of probated suspension, the 
student is found guilty of an additional violation of Section 
B-2 after a hearing, suspension may become immediately 
effective and may be extended for a longer period of time 
than the period of probated suspension originally assigned. 

"Suspension" means termination of student status for a 
limited time, generally without grades; however, in cases 
such as academic dishonesty, a directed grade for a par- 
ticular course may be appropriate. 



"Expulsion" means permanent termination of student 
status, generally without grades; however, in cases such as 
academic dishonesty, a directed grade for a particular 
course may be appropriate. 

B. Student Conduct 

1. General. Students are expected and required to abide 
by the laws of the State of Indiana and of the United States 
and the rules and regulations of Purdue University, to 
conduct themselves in accordance with accepted standards 
of social behavior, to respect the rights of others, and to 
refrain from any conduct which tends to obstruct the work 
of the university or to be injurious to the welfare of the 
university. A student who violates these general standards 
of conduct may be subject to administrative actions (as 
defined in Section A-5). If the violation falls within one of 
the categories of misconduct listed in Section B-2, the 
student may also be subject to disciplinary penalties (as 
defined in Section A-5). No disciplinary penalty may be 
imposed except for misconduct covered by one of the 
categories listed in Section B-2. 

2. Misconduct Subject to Disciplinary Penalties. The 
following actions constitute misconduct for which students 
may be subject to administrative action or disciplinary 
penalties, a. Dishonesty in connection with any University 
activity. Cheating, plagiarism, or knowingly furnishing 
false information to the university are examples of 
dishonesty. 

The commitment of the acta of cheating, lying, stealing, 
and deceit in any of their diverse forms (such as the use of 
ghost-written papers, the use of substitutes for taking 
examinations, the use of illegal cribs, plagiarism, and 
copying during examinations) is dishonest and must not be 
tolerated. Moreover, knowingly to aid and abet, directly or 
indirectly, other parties in committing dishonest acts is in 
itself dishonest. 

b. Forgery, alteration, or the unauthorized use of 
university documents, records or identification. 

c. Obstruction of disruption of any university activity (as 
defined in Section A-5) or inciting, aiding, or encouraging 
other persons to engage in such conduct. If substantial 
obstruction or disruption is threatened or occurs, the 
president, or a designee, may issue a disciplinary 
suspension warning. The minimum disciplinary penalty for 
violation of this subsection during the period of such war- 
ning shall be suspension for the remainder of the semester 
(or summer session) during which the offense occurred and 
for the next full academic semester and any intervening 
summer session thereafter. However, a more severe 
disciplinary penalty may be imposed. 

d. Physical abuse of any person or conduct which 
threatens or endangers the health or safety of any other 

(Continued on page 1 1 &gt; 



(Continued from page 10) 

person, whether or not such conduct occurs on university 
property. 

e. Theft, attempted theft, or damage of or to property of 
the university or of a member of the university community 
or campus visitor. 

f. Unauthroized entry, or use, or occupancy of university 
facilities. 

g. Violation of any university rule governing student 
organizations, or the use of university property (including 
the time, place, and manner of meetings or demonstrations 
on university property), or of any other university rule 
which Is reasonably related to the orderly operation of the 
university ; provided, however, that no disciplinary penalty 
shall be imposed in any such case unless it is shown that the 
accused student knew, or, in the exercise of reasonable 
care, should have known, of the rule in question. 

h. Use, possession, or distribution of narcotics or 
dangerous drugs, except as expressly permitted by law. 

i. Lewd, indecent, or obscene conduct or expression on 
university property. 

J. Failure to comply with directions of university officials 
acting in the performance of their duties. 

k. Any conduct which substantially threatens or in- 
terferes with the maintenance of appropriate order and 
discipline in the operation of the university, or any conduct 
on university property or in connection with a university 
activity which invades the rights of others. 

3. Demonstrations. Any individual or group activity or 
conduct, apparently intended to call attention to the par- 
ticipants' point of view on some issues, is not of itself 
misconduct, Demonstrations which do not involve conduct 
beyond the scope of constitutionally-protected rights of free 
speechand assembly are, of course, permissible. However, 
conduct which is otherwise improper can not be justified 
merely because it occurs in the context of a demonstration. 
Demonstrations which involve violations of any subsection 
of Section B-2. will not be permitted. A student will be 
charged with misconduct for any individual misconduct 
committed by the student in the course of a demonstration. 

5. Status During Disciplinary Proceedings. Except where 
summary action is taken as provided in Section C-7, the 
status of a student charged with misconduct shall not be 
affected pending the final disposition of charges, provided, 
however, that no diploma shall be given and no grades, 
academic credit, or degree shall be awarded to a student 
against whom charges are pending for which a disciplinary 
penalty may be imposed. The effective date of any 
disciplinary penalty shall be a date established by the final 
adjudicating body ( the dean's office of the campus appeals 
board). In case of suspension or expulsion, the student shall 
not be withdrawn any earlier than the date the notice of 
charges originated or later than the effective date 
established by the final adjudicating body. 

6. Misconduct Subject to Other Penalties. As provided in 
Chapter 273 of the 1969 Acts of the Indiana General 
Assembly, misconduct which constitutes a violation of 
these rules and regulations may be punished after deter- 
mination of guilt by the procedures herein provided without 
regard to whether such misconduct also constitutes an 
offense under the criminal laws of any state or of the United 
States of whether such conduct might result in civil liability 
or the violator to other persons. 

C. Procedures in Student Misconduct Cases 
1. Disciplinary and Administrative Action Proceedings, 
General. 

a. The procedures hereby established shall be followed in 
all cases in which the university institutes disciplinary 
proceedings or administrative action proceedings against 
students for violations of the rules of student conduct set 
forth in Section B. These procedures shall not apply to or 
affect the jurisdiction or procedures established by student 
organizations or similar organizations. 



b. Disciplinary proceedings are those proceedings 
initiated by the issuance of a notice of charges and are 
governed by the provisions of Section C-I to 7 inclusive. The 
term "disciplinary proceedings" does not include ad- 
ministrative action proceedings. 

c. Administrative action proceedings are informal in- 
vestigations conducted by the dean's office with a view to 
possible administrative action. Administrative action may 
be taken by the dean's office without instituting disciplinary 
proceedings, and such action shall be final and not subject 
to further hearing or appeal. A disciplinary penalty may not 
be imposed without first instituting disciplinary 
proceedings pursuant to Section C-2. If the dean's office 
confers with the student in the course of administrative 
action proceedings,~ncr statement made by the student 
during such conference shall be used against the student in 
any disciplinary proceedings which may thereafter be 
instituted. 

2. Institution of Disciplinary Proceeding!. 

a. Disciplinary proceedings shall be instituted by the 
dean's office by the issuance of notice of charges. 

b. The notice of charges (and all other written notices 
given to students against whom disciplinary proceedings 
are initiated) shall be delivered by the most effective 
method to the student's address as it then appears on the 
official records of the university. The notice shall inform 
the student of the rule or regulation allegedly violated, also 
fairly inform the student of the reported circumstances of 
the alleged violation, and request the student to appear in 
the dean's office for a hearing on the incident. A copy of 
these regulations shall accompany each notice of charges. 
A copy of the notice of charges may be sent to the parent or 
guardian of the student if the student is dependent as 
defined in Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1934. 

3. Failure to Respond to Charges. If the notice of charges 
requests the student to appear in the dean's office and the 
student fails or refuses to appear, the dean's office may, 
after such investigation as it may deem necessary, 
dismiss the charges, take administrative action, or im- 
pose a disciplinary penalty. If the dean's office takes ad- 
ministrative action, it shall notify the student in writing of 
such action, and such action shall not be subject to further 
hearing or appeal. If the dean's office imposes a 
disciplinary penalty, it shall notify the student in writing of 
such action, and the student may appeal such action to the 
campus appeals board as provided in Section C-6. When it 
appears necessary to avoid undue hardship or to avoid 
injustice, the dean's office may extend the time to enable a 
student to respond to the charges. 

4. Response to Charges. 

a. If the student appears in response to the notice of 
charges for the purpose of a hearing of the alleged violation 
as provided in Section C-5, the dean's office shall advise the 
student as fully as possible of the facts concerning the 
alleged charges and the names and addresses of witnesses 
then known to the dean's office. The student shall also be 
advised that no response is required, that any statement 
made by the student may be used against the student, that if 
the student remains silent, that silence will not be taken as 
an admission against the student, and that the student may 
advise the dean's office of any witnesses or evidence sup- 
porting the student's position. The dean's office shall also 
advise the student that if any new information is discovered 
during an investigation subsequent to the hearing, the 
student will have an opportunity to respond to such in- 
formation. 

b. After the hearing with the student and such further 
investigation as the dean's office deems necessary, the 
dean's office shall proceed as follows: 

1. If the dean's office determines that the violation 
alleged is not supported by the evidence, the charges shall 
be dismissed and the student notified. 

2. If the dean's office is satisfied that the violation oc-

curred as alleged, but that no disciplinary penalty shall be 
imposed, the dean's office may take administrative action 
and notify the student Such action by the dean's office shall 
be final and not subject to further hearing or appeal 

3. If the dean's office is satisfied that the violation oc- 
curred as alleged and that a disciplinary penalty should be 
imposed, the dean's office shall so notify the student. 

5. Conduct of Hearing. Each hearing shall be conducted 
before one or more members of the dean of students office 
staff and, although the bearing is informal in nature, it shall 
provide the student certain procedural safeguards. 

The student shall be given the opportunity to hear the 
evidence against him-her, rebut statements made by 
witnesses, present witnesses, evidence, or any relevant 
information in the student's own behalf. The student shall 
also be given the opportunity to respond to any new In- 
formation gathered during an investigation subsequent to 
the hearing. The dean of student's office has the burden of 
proving the student guilty of the alleged violation, and the 
decision of the dean's office shall be based solely on in- 
formation introduced at the hearing and obtained during 
subsequent investigations. 

No person other than the student shall be present during 
the discussion between the dean's office and the student 
except by mutual agreement of the dean's office and the 
student. 

Within five days following the conclusion of the hearing 
and subsequent investigation, the dean's office shall notify 
the student, in writing, of what action it will take. The 
decision letter shall contain a finding as to the guilt or in- 
nocence of the student and a brief statement of the reasons 
for the decision. Any discipunary penalty imposed or ad- 
ministrative action taken is subject to the provisions of 
Section B-4 of this regulation and any other university rule, 
regulation, or directive then existing. 

B. Appeal of the Dean's Office Decision. The student may 
appeal the decision of the dean's office to the campus ap- 
peals board. An appeal may be initialed by filing a notice of 
appeal with the campus appeals board through the dean's 
office or with the chair of the campus appeals noard. Such 
an appeal must be filed within seven days of the date on 
the letter from the dean's office containing the decision, ana 
the appeal must be personally signed by the student, The 
dean's office will provide the campus appeals board with a 
copy of the notice of charges and the decision letter sent to 
the student. The university will be represented at the ap- 
peal hearing by the dean's office or other appointed 
representative. 

7. Summary Action. Summary discipunary action by way 
of temporary suspension and exclusion from university 
property may be taken against a student charged with 
misconduct without the issuance of a notice of charges and 
without the procedures prescribed in Section C on the 
following conditions: Summary action shall be taken only 
by the president of the university or by an authorized vice 
president of the university, and only after the student shall 
have been given an opportunity to be heard if such 
procedure is practical and feasible under the cir- 
cumstances. Summary action shall be taken only if the 
president or vice president is satisfied that the continued 
presence of the student on university property threatens 
harm to the student or to any others. Whenever summary 
action is token under this Section C-7. the procedures 
provided for in Section C for hearing and appeal shall be 
expedited so far as possible in order to shorten the period of 
summary action. 

D. The Campus Appeals Board 

1. Organization and Jurisdiction. 
A campus Appeals board shall be established for each 

campus of the university. 

2. Conduct of Appeal 
a. The campus appeals board may prescribe regulations

Counseling, testing and 
placement services 

Counseling, testing and placement services provide 
counseling, career assessment, testing, part-time and full- 
time job placement, and career education. These services 
are available to all students, prospective students, alumni, 
faculty and staff. We are located in Walb Memorial Union 
113. 

Counseling. Professional counselors can assist you with 
crisis situations, anxiety issues, career decision-making, 
interpersonal relationship problems, or any other issues 
that may be stressful or challenging. When appropriate, 
referrals are made to other campus services or to com- 
munity agencies. Call 482-5656. 

Testing. Career-assessment groups meet regularly to 
administer and interpret career interest inventories 
designed to assist you with your career and educational 
development. Also, we can provide information on all 
national testing programs, such as SAT, CLEP, and GMAT, 
and institutional testing programs, such as the IPFW 
English and math placement tests. Call_482-5656. 

Placement. The placement office provides services to 
IPFW students as well as to all Indiana University and 
Purdue University alumni, regardless of the campus they 
attended. These services include free registration with the 
placement office, help in writing resumes, information 
about the job outlook, salary information, career coun- 
seling, and career and interest testing at a modest fee. In 
addition, the career library contains numerous books and 
occupation briefs describing hundreds of occupations as

undecided and pre-business students attending Indiana- 
Purdue. So if you are still uncertain about your major or 
have questions regarding the university, the student 
academic counseling staff can help. 



Alumni 

NO MORE PENCILS. NO MORE BOOKS, 
NO MORE TEACHERS' DIRTY LOOKS. 

It is a nightmare, this childhood dream of an endless 
summer vacation. And the more schooling we get, the more 
we are likely to recognize education's impor- 
tance to our economic, social, and psychological well-being. 

IPFW's alumni organizations are the formal means by 
which the holders of nearly 18,000 degrees conferred at 
IPFW translate this recognition into action. Through the 
alumni office, graduates sponsor career nights for alumni- 
to-be, athletic and scholarship programs, Red and Gold 
Carpet Days for prospective students and their families, the 
Graduating Class Council, and many other activities which 
bring enjoyment and recognize graduates' debt to higher 
education: IPFW alumni often send their children and neigh- 
bors — and sometimes their parents — to IPFW, and an 
unusually high number of IPFW alumni themselves return 
for additional credit or noncredit study; more pencils, more 
books ... 

Earning your degree at IPFW brings automatic mem- 
bership in the IPFW alumni organization and in either the 
Indiana University Alumni Association or the Purdue 
Alumni Association. The staff of the IPFW alumni office 
(Kettler 112, phone 482-5343) hope you will be an active 
member, a contributor to the academic and co-curricular 
life of the campus at which you completed the foundation for 
your personal success. 



Disabled student services 

Any student who has a physical disability or other im- 
pairments which may make academic achievement difficult 
should call 482-5530 or come to Athletic Center 204. 

The disabled student services office provides readers for 
the visually impaired, textbooks on cassette tape, notetakers 
and interpreters for the hearing impaired, outdoor escort 
service in inclement weather for persons in wheelchairs, 
orientation to the campus, exam proctoring, academic 
counseling, and use of special materials and equipment 
located in Athletic Center 207. 

All buildings on campus are accessible, and the 
wheelchair logo marks accessible interior facilities. 



Job location services 



The job location service is an employment service for 
students seeking part-time employment off campus. We are 
located in Walb Memorial Union 113 (482-5647). 

Coir listing of employment opportunities includes jobs of 
almost every type, skilled and unskilled. Jobs that have 
been listed in the past range from housecleaning and 
waiter-waitress jobs to market researcher and lab 
technician. Participation in a handyperson pool, babysit- 
ting pool, and typing pool is also open. Pay rates vary ac- 
cording to the job and the employer. Referrals are based 
upon individual employment skills and preferences.

Arts and crafts room 



Grade appeals procedure 



The arts and crafts room is a unique feature of the FPFW 
campus. Located in Walb Memorial Union 214 and 218 it 
offers a variety of resources: a darkroom for black-and- 
white photography, weaving looms, lapidary and 
ailkscreening equipment, a large ceramics area that in- 
cludes potter's wheels and an electric kiln, a drawing and 
painting area, and a woodworking shop which houses 
motorized saws, a drill press, and other basic equipment for 
carpentry. All students, faculty, staff, and alumni of IPFW 
are invited to use the room and its facilities, free of charge. 

The room is designed as a comfortable setting for those 
wishing to take a break from the everyday stress of classes, 
studies, and-or work. It also provides an accessible place 
for students to work on their school-related projects such as 
graphs, posters, illustrations, etc. A creative atmosphere is 
offered for those wanting to learn about art, yet who never 
before had such a wide range of facilities at their disposal. 

Although the arts and crafts room provides much of the 
necessary equipment, those wishing to use the facilities 
must furnish the consumable materials. For example, 
those interested in ceramics must purchase clay and 
glazes. Those who want to print photographs must buy 
photographic paper and chemicals. Lockers, in the hallway 
adjacent to the craft room, are recommended for personal 
art-supply storage. A list of local art-supply stores is on 
display in the crafts room. 

During an average week, approximately 50-75 people use 
the room. The time between Thanksgiving and Christmas is 
the busiest, since many students and staff make use of the 
facilities for gifts. Here's just a sampling of what has come 
out of the crafts room: stereo speakers, silk-screened 
Christmas cards, a silver ring and bracelet set, matching 
end tables, a ceramic dinnerware set, silk-screened T- 
shirts, loom-woven wool scarves, and life-sized Indian-chief 
sculpture, 

The crafts room is physically accessible to the disabled, 
and the staff believes art to be an important and vital outlet 
for them. Since each student receives individual attention, 
each is encouraged to work at her or his own level of 
achievement. Blind students have made beautiful ceramic 
and sculpture pieces; paraplegics have been involved in 
woodworking and photography. 



Veterans' services 

Your GI Bill education benefits can be used at IPFW. The 
veterans' services office in Kettler 107 will help you apply 
for aid. Usually, the only form you should bring is your 
discharge paper (DD214) . 

Normal processing time for a new application is 45-60 
days. 

The Vet-Rep-On-Campus has information dealing withall 
phases of veterans' benefits, or can refer you to the proper 
community agencies. 



The academic appeals process applies to all students 
enrolled at D?FW. It can be used by any student who has 
evidence or believes that evidence exists to show that a 
course grade was assigned or a similar evaluation was made 
as a result of prejudice, caprice, or other improper condition 
such as mechanical error. 

In appealing, the student must support in writing the 
allegation that an improper decision has been made and 
must specify the remedy sought The student should seek the 
assistance of the Dean of Student Services in pursuing the 
appeal. During an appeal, the burden of proof is on the 
student, except in the case of alleged academic dishonesty, 
where the instructor mustsupport the allegation. 

Grades may be changed only by a university authority 
upon the decision of the Academic Appeals Subcommittee, 
or by the instructor any time prior to the decision of the 
Academic Appeals Subcommittee. 
Timing of Appeals 

An appeal must be initiated no later than the fourth week 
of the fall or spring semester immediately following the 
session in which the decision was made. Each successive 
step in the appeals procedure must be initiated within three 
calendar weeks of the completion of the prior step. 
Steps in the Process of an Academic Appeal 

1. Course instructor: The student makes an appointment 
with the instructor to discuss the matter. ( If the instructor is 
unavailable, the department-division-program chair shall 
authorize an extension of time or allow the student to 
proceed to Step 2.) 

2. Department-division-program: If the matter has not 
been resolved at Step 1, the student makes an appointment 
with the chair of the department-division-program offering 
the course, who will direct the student procedurally in 
making an appeal to the appropriate committee. 

3. Academic Appeals Subcommittee: If the matter has not 
been resolved at Step 2, the student makes an appointment 
with the Dean of the Faculty, who will direct the student 
procedurally in submitting the case to the Academic Appeals 
Subcommittee. 



Depart men t-Divis Ion-Program Appeals Procedure 

Each department-division- program will establish appeals 
procedures which provide for a committee of three or more 
Faculty members responsible for hearing academic appeals 
related to courses listed or administered by that depart- 
ment-division-program if those appeals have not been 
satisfactorily resolved between the student and the In- 
structor. The procedures established by each department- 
division-program shall provide for each case to be heard by 
only one such committee, and a copy of each unit's 
procedures will be given to the Deans of Student Services 
and of the Faculty, and to students upon request 
Academic Appeals Subcommittee 

This subcommittee shall consist of seven members and 
three alternate members elected from among the Instruc- 
tional Faculty according to procedures specified in the 
Senate Bylaws. 

No member of the subcommittee may take part in an 
appeal involving a course or instructor from the member's 
department-division-program. Alternates will be assigned 
by the chair to serve as regular members in such cases. 

Before hearing the details of a case, the subcommittee will 
decide whether to consider the appeal, and will report its 
decision in writing to the student and the instructor. 
Decisions to consider an appeal will be based upon a finding 
that (1) improper procedures have been followed by 
university employees at earlier steps of the appeal; (2) new 
information is present; or (3) the instructor has declined to 
accept the department-division- program committee's 
recommendation. 

If the case is heard, every member of the subcommittee 
will vote on whether the appeal is valid and, if so, on what 
remedy should be provided If the subcommittee, by 
majority vote, finds in favor of changing a grade, the chair 
shall report this finding to the registrar. The decision of the 
subcommittee is binding on all parties and may not be ap- 
pealed. 

The subcommittee shall report its findings and actions to 
the student, the Dean of the Faculty, the department- 
division-program from which the appeal came, and the 
instructor. 



Greeks 



B67-/9W-1 




College is a whirlwind of activity. In its boundaries lie 
opportunities leading to the new and unknown, op- 
portunities to help you grow and discover yourself and your 
potential. 

A college education is not just a four-year classroom 
experience, but also a time of personal growth and 
development. You'll meet all types of people and become 
exposed to all types of lifestyles. You may find much you 
once believed in to be challenged, and those things you once 
took for granted may no longer be so easily ignored. 

In the middle of this new-found activity, you may find 
yourself lost, with no place to turn for help. 

As a result, you may find it desirable to seek within the 
university a smaller community with which to share. A 
sorority or fraternity provides just this — a base from 
which you can become involved and grow. 

Within the Greek system, a special kind of growth takes 
place, one that is rarely found in any other campus activity. 
You learn about yourself through interactions and close 
friendships in your sorority or fraternity and among other 
Greeks, and can use these experiences as a foundation for 
participation in the many other facets of university life, 
no other campus group does a community exist for the 
: purpose of enhancing individuality. 

Through the Greek system, you are given a better chance 
become involved, to grow, and to develop lasting 
friendships. 

SCHOLARSHIP is what college is all about. Greek 
organizations encourage members to grow intellectually 



and to achieve academic excellence, with the aid of 
scholarship committees and study buddies. 

LEADERSHIP experiences offered by the Greek system 
at IPFW range from chapter and Panhellenic Council of- 
fices to committees and student government. 
Encouragement to get involved with activities is supplied 
by many of the Greek organizations to their members. 

ACTP/ITIES for Greeks at IPFW include a variety of 
social events which give many fun-filled memories as well 
as the experience of being part of your school's activities. 
The events range from formal to informal dances, 
fraternity socials, Greek week, and the annual Harbor 
Arbor Day Festival and Three Rivers Festival. 

The list of social events and the opportunities to meet new 
friends and develop social awareness and skills are sub- 
stantial. 

PHILANTHROPICS are an important part of Greek life. 
Each organization has a national philanthropy which it 
supports. Members are asked to donate their time for 
service and to help raise money for their charity. A suc- 
cessful philanthropic endeavor takes dedication, patience 
and time, but rewards every member of the chapter. 

There are two sororities — Pi Beta Phi and Delta Gamma 
— and three fraternities — Sigma Phi Epsilon, Phi Kappa 
Theta, and Delta Sigma Pi. 

Rush information will be available at the student services 
office in Walb Memorial Union after August 23.
