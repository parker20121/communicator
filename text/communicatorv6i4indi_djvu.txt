Cafeteria costs rise 

Although the Student Union was planned to stand in the center of the future 

IU-PU campus, it now stands at the far north end because construction has 
slopped This puis the Union out of the way of many students and consequently they 
do not use the building. 

This less than optimal use ol the building means that many of its services are 
nol fully utilized For one of these services, this lack of use is spelling severe 
financial difficulty This service is the cafeteria. 

Last year University Fnod Services, a division ol Alt A, which was awarded the 
cafeteria contract, suffered a substanlial operating loss This year appears to be 
bringing much of the same. 

One major problem is the rise in food costs Any housewife is aware of the 
increasing cost ot food and its effeel on the household budget. These costs have 
been rising more sharply on the wholesale level, placing an even greater squeeze 
on the cafeteria's operating budget. 

Another area of rising costs is cafeteria clean -up University food Services has 
been forced tohire an additional stall member lu bus tables during the noon hours 
Although people have been urged to bus themselves, many do not. Hence, 
increased easts and decreased prof i I margins. And, of course, there are the 
perennial problems of dish and silverware breakage and pilferage, 

'Decreased profit margins must be compensated (or by increased revenues 
lluough greater customer volume Utilnrlunalely. this has nol been the case. On a 
normal day belween H liu and I, oulv /mi Hon people go lluough the cafeteria lines. 
This represents a meager It) per cent of the people who allend classes or work on 
campus. 

ARAisnol alone in its problems The Chronicle ol Higher Kduealion reported 
that many universities arc losing money on their cafeterias. Most have 
..uinpensated by increasing prices or by making board payments mandatory. 

It is obvious Dial AHA will nol care to operate the cafeteria al a loss every 
year. Returning the cafeteria to the university for operation will be potentially 
more disastrous If a competent prolcssjonal lood service orgaiuz.alion like ARA 

canto' operate the cafeteria at a profit, the university b ureaucracy will do no Establ 

better and probabh much worse The loss b\ the university would have to be made 
up out of academic funds or through increased student fees No one wants that. 

Increased volume would do much toward easing the financial bind. Self-busing Mark 

will help also Another answer, increasing prices, is something everyone wants to Put 

This paper realizes how difficult it is to rally support for the cafeteria. 

Contemporary prejudice insists that school cafeterias serve bad food, give rotten Michael Snyde 

service, and charge too much If enough people can sef aside this prejudice, the Managing Edit 

present levels of service and prices can be maintained in the cafeteria.
