Study shows alcohol might shrink the brain and cause dementia 



By Hannah Feig 



Alcnhotconsumption, 
even in small amoundt, 
mighl shrink brain size 
In ihe long run, accord- 
ing 10 a recent study. 

The study, con- 
ducted at Boston 
University, tested 
1,839 people age 
33-88, It shows that 
there is about a l.fi 
percent difference 
between the to- 
tal brain volume 
ot hcav7 alcohol 
drinkers and ab- 
stainers. Wliai 
it does not .kI

laled with brain size. 

"The amount of 
shrinkage reponed is 
equal lo less ihan a year 
of life,' said James Mor- 
timer, Ph.D., a profe! 



and 




searcher in the 
College of f^blJc 
Health. 'It is not 
clear whether or 
not people were 
worse off cogni- 
tively." 

The study is 
still on impor- 
tant find, how- 
ever, because it 
sheds new light 
on the effects of 
drinking alco- 
small 



Research shows that 
the brain shrinks with 
age — slowly at first, but 
more rapidly at older 
ages. When the brain 
shrinks in certain areas, 
it can cause diseases that 
impair brain function.

more vulnerable." Andel 
said.

of braJn atrophy in old 
age." Mortimer said. 

Dementia, caused by 
a rapid loss of brain cells, 
starts in the hippocam- 
pus region of the br^in, 
said Ross Andel, a profes- 
sorin the School of Aging 
Studies. From there, he 
said, it spreads to other 
parts of the brain and af- 
fects memory and other 
brain functions. 

Alcohol can have pos- 
itive and negative effects 
on brain function. Both 
Mortimer and Andel said 
it depends on how much 
a person drinks. College 
students who binge drink 
take the least healthy 
track by drinking large 
quantities of alcohol in a 




amounts, 
Andel 
said. With 
large 

doses of 

alcohol, 
however, the cells be- 
come too vulnerable and 
die easily. Alcohol also 
dehydrates the brain and 
body 



'People who are al- 
coholics have a consid- 
erable amount of brain 
shrinkage,' Mortimer 
said. 

Though the study 
shows that people with 
histories of light or mod- 
erate drinking — I to 2 
drinks per day — have 
smaller brains, many 
other studies show that 
they arc actually more 
healthy than those who 
abstain or drink heavily, 
Andel said. 

"(Moderate drinking) 
may shrink the brain, but 
it makes it work well," he 
said. 



.Mcohol, III Miull 
amounts, is known to 
prevent Alzheimer's dis- 
ease and dementia, Mor- 
timer said. 

It also helps prevent 
heart disease, Andel 
said, and increases good 
cholesterol levels while 
breaking down bad cho- 
lesterol. 

College students may 
be vvorse off if they start 
drinking large amounts 
of alcohol at a young age, 
Mortimer said, because 
they can develop hab- 
its that could last their 
whole lives.

Wiih college luilion 
higher than ever, iludcnls 
in some extreme ca^s 
have fled Ihc country amid 
mourning debt Trom ^ludcnl 

"Wc underhand ihat 
siudcnts are now Inking on 
more debt ihan Ihey ever 
have before," Bridget Curl, 
a\soci]]le director of pro- 
gram adminislralion and 
compliance in the Finan- 
cial Aid office at Illinois 
Stale University, said. "We 
always encourage students 
10 budget their money in 
school, and to borrow only 
what they need." 

"What we're seeing as a 
credit counseling agency is 
ihai more people are com- 
ing lo us because ihey can't 
utTord to pay ihose loans 
when they come due," Heidi 
Bernrdi. an ISU graduate 
and vice president of Fam- 
ily Credit Management, a 
non-pntfil agency devoted 
to helping consumers deal 
with debt, said. 



Berardi says her of- 
fice in Normal has been so 
busy with clients who arc 
simggling to pay home and 
uudcni loan.s that they have 
had to extend their hours to 
midnight. 

"It's a combination of 
higher interest rates for 
student loans, and studenLs

qualif&gt;' for a forbearance or 
deferment which would slop 
payment until they're tinan- 
cially able to pay." 

Curl agreed, saying, 
"The lenders don't want 
students to llec the country. 
They want the loan to be 
paid, and more often than 
not, they arc willing lo work 

with the siu- 

dent."

option Be-

gested

going 
impro 



the ■ 



economy. 

Before studcnU start 
running from debt, Berardi 
recommends researching 
the ways to manage it. 

"The first thing [stu- 
denLs] want to do is com- 
municate with their lender 
and explain they can't af- 
ford the loan," she said. 
"They might be able lo 



"[Com- 

ne] sevcr- 

loans into 

one loan so 

^^^ it's easier 

to make one 

payment," she explained. 

"One place to go would be 

Sallie Mae or the U.S. Dept. 

of Education." 

"They would be able to 
give pretty low fixed inter- 
est rates." 

Berardi explained dial 
knowing about the options 



"If [siudcnkj... rescaivh 
their options before they call 
the lender, ihcrrs a greater 
chance they'll be able to re- 
solve their situation." 

To avoid incurring mas- 
sive amounts of debt, Kevin 
Kuebler, a CPA and finan- 
cial planner widi AXA advi- 
sors, suggesLs having a plan 
to pay off your loan. 

"Anytime you go into 
any investment or vehicle 
loan you need to have a 
plan 10 come out of it." he 
said. "If we first understand 
tile extent of our loans and 
die fact that we're going to 
have to pay them off some- 
lime then we wouldn't be in 
the position where we have 
to (lec." 

"The biggest advice dial 
I have is lo live within your 
means," he added. "When 
you get into the habit of 
buying things you can't af- 
ford, that's what creates the 
problem."

tures of jTJur item. N'o 



scription and title. Be 
as detailed as possible 
when describing your 
item. Point out any dents 
or scratches iheitem may 
have and where they're 
located. Make raur title 



one likes a blurry- or search engine ^endly by 



using popular words and 
phrases. 

- Accept Paypal as a pay- 
ment method in your 
listing, like I already 
mentioned. Paypal is 
the preferred way to pay 
among eBay users. 

- Act professional. Provide 
the kind of customer ser- 
vice that will build up your 
reputation. Doing so will 
increase your feedback 
fating, in turn, giving you 
a greater chance at sell- 
ing &gt;-our item at a higher 
price. 



Five Tips Eor Buyers: 



- Lcam how to snipe. This 
is a sure-fire way of win- 
ning auctions on eBay 
and it's really fun to do. 
If you know an item will 
be hot, then learn how 
to snipe at the last min- 
ute- Here's how: Open 
one window with the 
auction listing. Open a 
second mndow with the 
same listing and place 
the highest amount you 
are willing to pay for the 
item and hit "Place Bid." 
Now enter your user- 
name and password if 
you haven't done so al- 
ready and then it should 
ask to confirm your bid. 
Do not do this yeL Wait 
until 10 or 15 seconds 
before the auction ends. 
(Be fresh your first win- 
dow to keep track of the 
lime left). Ai the right 
moment, hit "Confirm 
Bid". With luck, your bid 
will arrhe at the perfect 
time to leave your com- 
petition in the dust, easy 
win. 



- Use Paypal. Sellers want 
to be paid quickly and 
everyone is concerned 
about h3ud. There is 
no faster or safer way to 
complete an eBay trans- 
action than by using 
PayPal (owned by eBay). 
PayPal is used by almost 
alt eBay users and is also 
fiilly integrated into eBay. 
Take the time to become 
a verified seller and use 
a verified shipping ad- 
dress. This gets you the 
fraud protection. Go to 
Error! Hyperlink refer- 
ence not valid, to create 
an account if you haven't 
already. 

- Check the seller's feed- 
back rating. You are 
spending your hard- 
earned money, so it pays 
to check the feedback 
about the person you're 
thinking of buying from. 
It's obvious that if you 
see a bunch of negative 
comments, stay away 
from this seller. If you 
see positive, then pro-

Mars Candy force feeding rats, 

creates consequences 



By Kelly McLendon 

SlaflWilto 



The details or animal 
testing are not new. Over 
the past Tew years, there 
have been many inci- 
dences recorded by the 
media relating to compa- 
ny complaints Tor testing 
commercial products on 
innocent animals. The 
latest company under 
scrutiny is Mars Candy, 
which makes M&amp;M's, 
Dove, T\m, Starburst and 
Snickers, 

Organizing the cam- 
paign against Mars is 
PETA, an organization 
that is typically stigma- 
tized for its questionable 
approaches to chang- 
ing the world, one freed 
animal at a time. PETA 
stipulates that, "Mars re- 
cently funded a deadly 
experiment on rats to 
determine the effects of 
chocolate ingredients on 
their blood vessels," 

Tlie ejqjeriments Mars 
conducts include force 
feeding rats. They force- 
fed the rats by shoving 



plastic tubes down their 
throats and then cut 
open the rats' legs to ex- 
pose an artery which was 
clamped shut to block 
blood flow. " according to 
the PETA website. 

The tests conducted 
on these animals have 
produced many conse- 
quences, botti for the 
companies that orches- 
trate them and for the 
animals who are forced 
to sit through them. Mars 
animal testing has led "to 
internal bleeding and 
other deadly complica- 
tions," for the subjected 
rats. 

The biggest ques- 
tion is why Mars has to 
test the effects of choco- 
late on the blood ves- 
sels of rats. First, in the 
scientific community, 
why are rats and people 
comparable? Last time 
it was checked, people 
and rats don't have simi- 
lar body weights or ana- 
tomical construction. In 
comparison, the average 
adult male weighs about 
160 pounds, whereas 
the a\-erage adult rat 
weighs about 1 pound. 



Where's the similarity in 
those statistics? Second, 
why does it maner how 
chocolate affects blood 
vessels? 

In moderation, all 
foods, including choco- 
late, are fine. The ef- 
fects the compounds in 
chocolate have on blood 
vessels are relatively un- 
important, unless one 
would binge and eat a 
pound or more of choco- 
late. The fact that Mars 
is trying to conduct re- 
search on these animals 
suggests they believe 
their chocolate is bad for 
arteries. Perhaps a boy- 
cott of only Mars choco- 
late is in order, since 
the way they must use 
animals to test a virtually 
unfound theory. 

Overall, Mars is trying 
to make a statement that 
their candy is not worthy 
of consuming, due to the 
fact that they must test on 
sad, sickly animals that 
only weigh one pound 
to test a theory that has 
xiriually no basis. Check 
out more information on 
this b&gt;' going to marscan-

"The Haunting" 

Falls Short 




By Marisha Zimmerman 

Aiti jnd EnlpilJinmtnl UIW 

This weekend saw ihe 
opening of several scary 
movies just in time for 
Halloween, indudinf&gt; 
"The llaunling of Molly 
Hartley" 

Molly Hartley has just 
moved to a new to\vn to 
start over with her dad. 
She attends a high-class 
prep school and is trying 
to make new friends while 
also dealing with a terri- 
fying event that brought 
her to the new town and 
the strange feelings grow- 
ing Inside her. Molly Is 
starting to hear voices 
and is becoming more 
aggressive and agitated. 
She knows something is 
very wrong, bui she can't 



seem to figure out what 
it Is or how 10 stop It. She 
knows that she has to fig- 
ure it out before she turns 
eighteen, When the truth 
is revealed, she will have 
to make a difhcult choice 
about the rest of her life. 

As promising as the 
movie sounds and is por- 
trayed in the previews, it 
actually falls very short of 
expectations. Haley Den- 
nett, who portrays Molly 
Hartley, is convincing In 
her portrayl of a girl con- 
fused and scared about 
what is happening to her 
and still trying to hold it 
together for fear of going 
crazy. 

Most of Ihe other actors 
portray their characters 
well and are convincing, 
so Ihe problem seems to 



lie more Willi the story it- 
self. 

Even though the ques- 
tlon of what Is happen- 
ing to her is answered, It 
is never really clear wltiit 
will truly become nf her. 
Ii is not clear exacdy how 
this will affect her or how 
it will change her life oth- 
er than giving her power 
and success. 

The story just lacks 
those line details that 
would make It very cap- 
tivating. Unlike the cliar- 
acters, the story Is just 
not that convincing and 
lacks the characteristics 
of a truly scary Hdtowoen 
movie. Really, if a person 
wants to be scared nn I lal- 
lowcen night, Ihe original 
"The Exorcist" is a much 
better choice. 



Jolie Scores Big 
in Cliangeling 



By Zach Moore 

U-Wire 



In folklore, a change- 
ling is the offspring of a 
fairy, elf. or iroll that is 
substituted for a human 
child unbeknownst to his 
or herparents. The human 
child would then be taken 
by the mythical creature 
for its own purposes, nev- 
er to return home, 

"Changeling" recounts 
the true story of Walter 
Collins (Gatdin Griffidi), 
a 9-year-old boy who dis- 
appears from his home in 
1928, While die circum- 
stances of Waiter's case 
are far from supematu- 
rai, the changeling anal- 
ogy comes into play once 
die Los Angeles Police 
Department, after a five- 
month search, claims to 
have found Waller and 
presents the child to his 
modier Christine (Ange- 
hnalolie). 



Despite the depart- 
ment's insistence that the 
boy is hers, Ms, Collins 
knows better. In addition 
to physical differences, 
his personality is not like 
die Waller that Christine 
knew, and the child has 
iitde memory of specific 
details about his life. 

Aided by the Rev. Gus- 
lav Briegleb (John Mal- 
kovich), an activist who 
wants to shine light on the 
wrongdoings of the cor- 
rupt police department, 
Ms, Collins begins an ex- 
haustive effort to uncover 
the truth behind her sons 
disappearance and "re- 
covery." Blocked at almost 
every turn, Collins soon 
realizes her situation is 
only a small sample of the 
unjust system and faces 
levels of prejudice that 
were a true Ijyprodua of 
a ume when women's and 
children's rights still had a 
long way to go. 

Ms. Cxillins' experienc- 
es would go on to help ex- 



pose Ihe deep-seated cor- 
ruption of the LAPD and 
lead to ma.ssivc reforms 
that would clean up Ijoi 
Angeles and free its citi- 
zens ftom the tyrannical 
hierarchy of Ihe police 
force. 

The acting is excellent 
and the film has several 
Oscar nomination pros- 
pects, folie's portrayal of 
Ms. Collins is at the heart 
and soul of the film, lollc 
effectively displays a wide 
range of emotional states 
from a distraught mother 
coping with a missing 
child, lo a delianl activist 
standing up to abusive au- 
ihoriry figures. Malkovich 
does well in the relatively 
small but important role 
of the Rev. Briegleb. While 
he always excels at play- 
ing the villain, it's refresh- 
ing to see him as a good 
guy every now and then. 
All in all, 'Changeling" is 
a movie worth seeing.

The venue's pur- 
pose was to promote 
healthcare awareness by 



providing health infor-

consumer's health. In- 
doors this meant screen- 
ings and referrals. 

Despite a long line 
and rain, people waited 
to be interviewed and 
screened for high blood 
pressure, cholesterol, 
cancer and more and 
then referred to a com- 
munity group, such as

was the 12th Annual Vet-

mittee, chaired by Greg 
Bedford. At Healthy Cit- 
ies, part of the outdoor 
tent was for the veter- 
ans. Bedford said, "The 
clothes and supplies 
come from our fundrais- 
ers and collections at the 
plant during the year." 
Local 2209 had veteran's 
committee volunteers 
distributing clothes and 
supplies to needy veter- 
ans and a chaplain offer- 
ing spiritual counseling. 
More than a few hundred 
were served that day. 

Mann explained the 



role of Wayne Township. 
"Wayne Township Is 
the host. One day, each 
year, they turn the entire 
building into a medical 
facility." Wayne Town- 
ship is one of 20 town- 
ships in Allen County, 
covering 42 square miles 
that include central and 
southwest Fort Wayne, 
with a year 2000 popula- 
tion of over 111.000. To 
attend the Healthy Cities 
Health Fair, one need not 
live in Wayne Tovmship, 
Fori Wayne or even Allen 
County, but one must be 
18 or older and be health- 
care uninsured, underin- 
sured or underserved. 

All in all, what Linda

from freshman guard Anne Boese and Zuppe. push- 
ing the IPFW lead back lo double digits.

Arnie's Army announces 2009 season schedule 



IPI-'W men's volleyball coach 
Arnic Ball released the 2009 
season schedule Friday afternoon 
which has the Mastodons playing 
16 home matches and features 
two matches against defending 
national champion Penn Siaie 
University. 

"I like the fact that we have 16 
home dates." coach Ball said. 
"This is a very young team that will 
need all the help it can get from 
our crowds. Not having to travel all 
over to play is a plus." 

The Mastodons open the season 
on January 9, with back-to-back 
matches against the University 
of Puerto Rico Mayaguez. The 
'Dons then have a week off from 
competition before traveling 
east to play Rutgers- Newark and 
Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball 
Association tournament ninner- 
up George Mason. 

IPFW then hosts seven 
consecutive liomcmatchcssiarting 
with three Midwest Intercollegiate 
Volleyball Association matches 
against Loyola Chicago, Ohio State 
and Lewis. The 'Dons then host a 
first-year program, Grand Canyon 
University, twice and Saint Francis 
(PAl before welcoming Penn State 



to conclude the home stand. 

"I just hope the fact that we 
don't have to travel all over to 
play will keep us fresh dovvn the 
home stretch both physically and 
mentally," Ball said. 

IPFW hosts the Pacific Tigers 
before going on iis first and only 
iwo-wcck road jaunt. The Long 
Beach State Tournament is the 
first stop as the Dons play Long 
Beach State March 13, and BYU 
the following night in Long Beach, 
CA. The following weekend IPFW 
travels to the Quaker State to 
battle Penn State on March 20, 
then Saint Francis (PA) on the 
21st. 

"Both of these weekends will 
be difficult as BYU, Long Beach 
and Penn State will all be ranked 
in the top 10 in the country," Ball 
said. "My hopes are that this will 
help us get ready for the MIVA. and 
tile last part of our schedule. The 
most important thing about these 
weekends is that we battle and 
avoid injuries."
