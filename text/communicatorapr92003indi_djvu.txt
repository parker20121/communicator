'Finding Commonality in 
our Differences' was Ihe Iheme 
for Ihe leaderstiip retreat spon- 
sored by the Office of 
Multicullural Services and 
IPSGA, 

The facililalors for Ihe 
weekend's events included 
Robert Bedford, chief learning 
officer for Leadership, 
Empowerment. Action and 
Development, L,E.A.D. and Ed 
Squires, a research assoriale In 
Ihe Office of Mullicullural 
Professional Development at 
lUPUl. The advisers for Ihe 
weekends both from IPFW's 
Multicullural Services, were 
Chris Douse, assistant director, 
and Palermo Galindo, coordina- 
tor of support sen'ices. 

What started oul as a Iheme 
became Ihc goal for Ihe students, 
advisers and facililalors al Ihc 
weekend's retreat. Afler dinner, 
all the participants read an 
arlicle from "The Chronicle of 



; Student I 
so Imporlant," by former 
Harvard University president 
Neil Rudensline. 

The most compelling argu- 
ment for a diverse student body 
was that diversity adds lo Ihe 
educational value of a university. 
According to Rudensline, 
"Students benefit in countless 
ways from Ihe opportunity lo 
live and learn among peers 
whose perspectives and experi- 
ences differ from their own. 

Afler 



f Ihe 
arlicle, Ihe students watched a 
video entitled "Skin Deep." The 
video described Ihe pliehl of a 
group of college sludenls of 
many different cullures and 
races from all over the counlrv.

Three IPFW political sdence 

Erofessors and one hislorj' pro- 
!SSor took lime oul Tuesday. 
April I, lo discuss America's war 
wilh Iraq. The 75-minulc session 
was the second in a scries lolook 
al the country's current involve- 
ment in Ihe ongoing action. 

During both gatherings, 
sludenls asked questions of 
political science professors Elliot 
M. Bartky, James M. Lulz and 
James Toole, along wilh hislorv 
professor Bemd Fischer. One 
topic brought up several limes 
by IPFW sludenls concerned the 
concepi of protesting during a 



"In 



democracy, it 
ipriate lo queslii 
I'tally, I don'l have any 



of war. I find the nature of some 
of Ihe protests disturbing," Toole 
said. "The principle of protest. 
Ihe principle of questiorung, Ihe 
principle of descent, I think for a 
democracy, is always valid," he 

Bartk)' added Ihe belief thai 
il is possible lo support 
America s troops while al ■ Ihe 
same lime questioning Ihe 
pohbciai\s who deploy Ihe 

"TTiose who don'l support 



policy slill have 
indeed an obligation, lo maCe it 
clear they don't." he said. 

He added that he thought it 
was partially protests in Ihe '60s 
and '70s Ihal ended the Vietnam 
War by showing the government 
that Ihey didn't have popular 
support for their policies.Toole 
believes bolh sides of the argu- 
ment champion the United 
Stales military. 

"I'd like lo think we're a 
sophislicaled enough society 
that \ve can make the distinction 
and we can say we all support 
the soldiers doing Ihe hard work 
we're not doing, and, on the 
other hand, the criticism of the 
political leaders. 1 think pretty 
much everybody supports the 
soldiers," Toole said, adding Ihal 
he thinks that was one of Ihe les- 
sons learned from Wetnam. 

Fischer wondered how 
many people debating Ihe war 
(Vere supporting Ihe troops, not- 
ing statistics (vere not available 
on Ihe numbers yet. Even if peo- 
ple consider the action "imperi- 
atislic," Ihere should be an effort 
lo support Ihe troops, Toole said. 
Fischer said there is an imperial- 
ism that helps America, and 
Toole agreed, saying that elimi- 
nating weapons of mass destruc- 
tion is a "laudable" goal. 

The ad minis Ira lion had 
slnjng words of warning lo Syria 



and Iraq last week, words of 
warning some of Ihe professors 
didn't Uilnk were helpful. "I was 
not impressed," Lutz said. The 
idea Ihat the words were coming 
from Secretary of Defense 
Donald Rumsfeld in public, and 
not Secrelary of Slate Colin 
Powell in private, 

surprised him. 

According to Fischer, il is 
important lo consider whal Ihe 
government knows. Using the 
military as a political strong-arm 
in situations like those in Syria 
and Iraq may be somettiing 
America docs more of in the next 
few years, the professors said. 

When asked how long Ihe 
war might run and how long it 
would be tolerated, the professois 

The effects on American 
relations wilh countries of Ihe 
Middle East may last much 
longer, he added. Causality " 



ures and media 



coverage v 



play a part, Bartky believes. 

Both Lulz and Bartky 
twlieve support "is beginning to 
wane" for the conflict. 
Depictions of Iraqi citizens have 
been contradictory, a sludenl 
noted. One version is they want 
lo be liberated for Saddam 
Hussein; the other is they are 
taking arms against America. 

"They are bolh correct. Il 
depends on the situation." Lutz 



said. 

He said a lol of the paramil- 
ilary laking up arms against 
America feci Ihcy might as well 
fighl. They have been a part of 
Hussein's force for over 20 years, 
and they will face severe retribu- 
tion from ordinary Iraqis if they 
lose this batlle. he added. Toole 
has studied dictatorships and 
believes there is a certain men- 
tality among some of the people, 

"If 1 had been living under a 
dictatorship like Saddam 
Hussein's — a particularly cruel 
one — I would not cast my lot 
wilh the invading force until I 
was absolutely cerlain my dicta- 
tor was oul of Ihe pichire." He 
said it is "rational" for some of 
the people. Being shown on 
inlemational I ele vision fighting 
wilh the invaders can backfire 
against a citizen's family and 
themselves if Ihe liberation 
fails. 

Fischer agreed, but said 
America seemed taken aback by 
the lack of an uprising against 
Hussein's regime. 

"It is scary Ihat our policy 
plarmers didn'l think atmut that, 
which is disturbing, obviously. It 
means Ihey have not thought 
through wfial lo expect locJIy, 
on the Arab street, and may not 
have thought through what to 
expect from America as well," 
Fischer said.

IPFW to host Alcohol Awareness Day 



On Thursday, April 10, 
IPFW will host the fifth annual 
IPFW Alcohol Awareness and 
Screening Day in VValb Student 
Union. Room 114. The event is 
intended lo raise awareness of 
problematic drinking habits 
common to many students' way 
of life. 

Free educational information 
on how lo break free from alcohol 
abuse will be available, as well 
as confidential screenings wilh a 
menial health professional. 
Screenings will give sludenls 
assessments based upon levels 
of use. The results of the 
screenings may vary from those 
who are cunenlly dealing wilh 
drinking appropriately to high 
risk behaviors Ihal may require 
more attention and furlficr work 
wilh counselors. 

"Often students don't 
realize Ihe subtle impact drink- 
ing has on Iheir lives," said 
Chris Kuznar, IPFW Substance 
Abuse Council chair. "They 
don't realize Ihe accumulative 
effects from missing classis and

From the Left: Affirmative action Racial diversity: From the Right 

practiced bv the Universily of Michigan, 
lowers slaniiardstoachievc racial diversity, thus 
discrimiculing against the mure qualified. 

The point here is that African-Americans are 
ei'eiv bit as inrcUigenl and able to succieed in the 
acadenvic community as arc Caucasians and 
Asians. Anyone who would dispule this claim is 
an ignorant racist and should be shot Bui if 
African- Americans are equally intelligent and 
able tosuccecd in the world, why are they 
getting preferential Irealment? 

There are \avis lo prevent discrimination 

based on sex, racf, .ims ti'lii^mn .inJ (much to my

Early this month, the Supreme CoutI heard 
tcflimnny regarding (he Central Michigan 
University Affirmairve Action ease. Though a 
ruling won't be in for al least a couple months, 
Ihis c.iM- has reigniled the debate over Ihe legality 
and (.lirness of affirmalive action. Affirmative 
action does, by its very nature, create a system 
Ihal may sevm al first glance to be unfair. It sets 
hiring or admittance standanJs and quotas thai 
cause Ihe pendulum of equality to swing. 

I cannot say how I would frel If I knew some- 
■ ine with les^ education, lower test srores or a 
lower lei'elofexperience gained entrance to collcBe 
or gi'l ii job or promotion that 1 wanted. I would 
hope that if that happened to me. I would be able 
to respond in an enlightened way, but because 1

pulled out an old (eil from a sociology class Ihal I 
took a couple years ago to find stalistics. 
According to United Slats cei\sus findings from 
1997. povertv rates for all minority groups were 
higher thaii those of white Americans. The 
percentage of blacks. Hispanics and Native 
Americans in poverty was aboul three limes Ihal 
of whites. 

Racial inequality reaches way back into 
American history. While groups of European 
backgroimd have always been on top. while peo- 
ple of color are on bottom. The goal of affirmalive 
action Is to help create a new balance. Sometimes 
creating balance means that thependulum haslo

If ive lake a long, hunL-sl hiok at iiui history, 
we will find huge injustices placed on minorities. 
Determining who is a minonly is Lirgety a matter 
of history, politics and judgments. Age, gender, 
race and religious preference are generally what is 
used to designate minority status. II is important 
to ri;member Ihal majority- minority relations are 
relationships based on power the majority has 
powur. Ihe minority doesn't That power relation- 
ship creates a number of social inequalities thai

net inti&gt; an all women's college, Ihey were of/erL-d

were very feiv iicccptacilc careers for women. 

Women couldn't even press charges against 
their husbands for abuses such as assault or rape 
and eipect lo be defended or even heard. If wc 
really look at our system today, il has improved; 
but il still has a long way lo go to really be fair.

rape, and our criminal justice svstcm is still biased

Americans, Native Americans and Hispanics by 
giving these minority groups 2Q points oul of a 
maximum of 150 points. At the law school, some 
minority 
students are admilled lo meet percentage targets, 
Al first glance this may seem really unfair or like 
reverse discriminalioa But is il really? 

When we consider Ihe fad that minorities are 
much more likely lo live in poverty Ihan whites. 
we must recognize thai poverty affects all aspects 
of life. Persons who live in poverty are living in 
less affluent areas. The schools in many cases are 
substandard, creating an educational disadvan- 
tage from youth. Poverty often means substan- 
dard health ate and poor nubition. Mosl people 
bom in America never jump social class. They 
generally die al or below the economic class in 
which Ihey were bom, ITie days when il was easy

programs should be commended. Programs, like 
Ihe one al Central Michigan University, seek to 
achvely and aggressively overcome Ihe effects of 



There is a benchmark case before Ihe 
Supreme Court this week. The Universily of 
Michigan is defending its policy of awarding a 
20-poinl "bonus" to applicants who belong lo 
under-represented minority groups. 13n the 
surface, this can be called an effort lo achieve 
racial diversity within Iheir shident body, but Ihe 
facts indicate it is something far more sinisler 
than that. 

So what's the big deal aboul a few points 
being given to minority candidates? For starters, 
the 20 points carries a huge weight on Ihe 150- 
poinl scale. To put this in perspective, a perfect 
SAT score is only worth 12 points. The 20 points 
is theexaci difference between a 4.0 CPAand a 3,0 
GPA. This means Ihal, according lo admissions 
policy, a minority candidate with a 3.0 GPA is as 
qualified as a white or Asian candidate with a 4.0 
GPA. Docs this make any sense? 

In fact, this allempi at diversity may be 
having an opposite effect on Ihc students it is 
supposed to be helping. The Dclreil News found 
thai, of Ihe black students who entered seven 
Michigan colleges and universities in 19»4. only 
40 percent gol Iheir diplomas after sin years. This 
is compared lo 61 percent of whites and 74 
percent of Asians, This same article concluded 
Ihal minority students were admilled lo schools 
based solely on their race, but with Ihe knowledge 
that a majority of Ihem were destined lo fail, 

I was amazed al Ihe number of minority 
opinioris that were 
against not only the 
race preferred 

admissions policy, 
but against all affir- 
mative action. In 
fact, such promi-

schools. Granting extra puints based on race goes 
beyond preventing prejudice, il discriminates 
against Ihe mosl qualified students in 
favor of Ihc most diverse student body. 

This admissions policy has lobe stopped. If 
Ihc races were reversed and while applicants 
were being given bonus points based on race, the 
iwhotc country would be up in arms, crying 
racism. Bui is something racist only tvhen il dis- 
criminales against a minority group? Or is il just 
as racist when a non-minorily group is wmnged 
because uFil7 

This policy places intelligent minority 
students into a rigorous academic situation for

Powell, Clarence 
Thomas and Larry

record as being 
against both pro-

these well-known 
minority represen- 
tatives be against affirmalive action? 

Secretary of Slate Colin Powell stated in his 
autobiography about equal rights, "They do nol 
mean preferential treatment. Preferences, no 
matter how well intended, ultimately breed 
resentment among the no n- preferred. And 
preferential treatment demeans the adiiev'e- 
ments that minority Americans win by their own 
efforts. The present debate over affirmative 
action has a lot lo do with definitions. If 
affirmative action means programs Ihal provide 
equalopportunity. IhcnlamaUrotil, Ifitlcadsto 

Ereferentiaf treatment or helps those who no 
ingernecd help, I am opposed." 

Supreme Court Juslice Clarence Thomas, a 
minoril}' ivho gol into law school years ago due 
to an affirmahve action program, has recently 
gone on record slating that affirmalive action is 
an idea that was great in its day, but is not 
necessary so in today's world, 

Larry Elder, an African-American radio 
lity staled in his weekly newslcller. 



references, the kind of affirn 



degree from a 
less challenging 
school? 

The 
world is full of successful people of all races who 
didn'l gel admitted lo Ihe best colleges in the 
country, but slill turned out just fine. In today's 
economic climate, a degree from any universily is 
golden, but few employers care lo hear what 
school you were admitted to and 5ubsc(|uenUy 
dropped out of. 

So please, let's eliminate Ihe subject of race 
from consideration all together. No one race is 
better than any other We all have the potential lo 
be great students and great professionals. Quotas 
and affirmalive action have no place in a world 
that is.supposed to be equal for all nii;es, 

I guess I can sum il all up with another quote 
from a famous African -Amen can. "I have a 
dream that my four children will one day live 
in a nation where Ihey will not be judged by Ihe 
color of Iheir skin but by the content of their 
character." Everybody knows thai Martin Luther 
King Jr. said these words in his famous speech 
nearly 50 years ago. I wonder what he would say 
about any race gelling preferred treatment 50 
years later, even it il was his own race? 



Ihe people, 
could begin to look 
beyond ourselves, we 
would be belter able to 
see thai when we help 
those who are at a disad- 
vantage, wc help Ihe 
whole of society, includ- 
ing ourselves. In a coun- 
try filled with diversity 
and cloaked in a hislory 
oF oppression, it is so 
important thai

Aeschylus, in 45S B.C. This is 
the story of the Greek king and 
warrior, Agamemnon and his 

Senior Dan Ambnjsc adapted,

of Ihis rather bloody story, 
entitled "The ■ Orcstcia:

do so today in 2003. 

Ambrose resurrected a blast

Nothing impressive about 'Art of Losing' 



Deep into the depths ol 
overgroiving punk music 
re-emerges Amencan Hi-Fi. The 
group made their presence felt 
with their self-titled 2001 debut, 
but since then have been mostly 
non-existent. 

And as sad as it is, I think 
that they needed to stay wherev- 
er it is that they have been. The 
band released their follow-up 
"The Art of Losing" early in this 
year. The highlight of their first 
album "Flavor of the Weak,'" 
made audiences pay attention to 
the band, and thankfully the title 
track of this disc keeps them 

So, mission accomplished. 
You have a song, and a video for 
that matter, that enhces listeners 
to buy the CD. From there, I'd 
expect a split reaction. 

The disc starts wilh the 
upbeat pop "The Art of Losing." 
The song is antagonizing 
enough to keep the listeners 
coming and defiantly has the' 
feel of their first disc. "The 
Breakup Song" folloivs up ivilh 
an Interesting blast ol rock, but it 
does sound frighteningly similar 
lo Sum 41 throughout the chorus. 



I must admit ho*vever. this is my 
second favorite cut from a CD 
that brings mostly that same 
bland punk sound. 

But then, track three blows 
all bad songs out of the water 
There is nothing beautiful about 
"Beautiful Dis.ister." The song 
seems like a blatant rip-off of 
any song by The Vines. It's 
amazing how similar singer 
Stacy Jones sounds comoaied to 
Vines vocalist Ctaig NicnoUs on 
this track 

Watch out, burning 
buildings! My fault, maybe it's 
the line "We go up in flames," 
coupled with the distinct '80s 
hair band vibe of "Save Mc" that 
jusi screamed Gn.-al White. But 
don't fear Ihis disc yet; it's not 
exactly Warrant, thank Cod. 

And by all means, if this 
disc didn't knock out numerous 
songs already, "Nothing Left to 
Lose" starts off xvith a "yeah" 
and a fciv "ums," matched ivilh 
a catchy guitar riff. Foi 



n that match ri 






distinctly, if not exactly, of Good 
Charlotte's "Little Things." 
Unfortunately for AHF, ihc resl 
of the track doesn't resemble 
much else that is good. 



ramble on through very uninter- 
esting lyrics, AHF redeem them- 
selves wilh "This is the Sound." 
It seems to be a steady Irund that 
after screaming and rocking out, 
every band has to have that sad 
emo'track. But this track is with- 
out a doubt one of the belter 
ones that I have heard. 

This Wack puinLs Jones liuI 
as one of the premier emotional 
lyric writers ol our lime, aliing 
with the likes of Chri.- Can,iba 
and Matthetv Pry or. 

"The Cold Hush' and 
"Built forSpced" siejiify that the 
band, white overall bcller Ihan 
their first allempt, slill has a lot 
of work to do, Finishine up the 
disc, the song "Happy ' makes 
me anything but. ft showcases 
the room thot AHF has to grow. 

A bonus for all CD owners. 
Island Records chipped in a few 
extra bucks to enhance this di.sc. 
On your disc, you can catch both 
the making of and the actual 
video "The Art of Losing," 
filmed at the house of two fans 
in Hays. Kan. 

AHF puis out an effort and 
makes waves wilh this disc. 
Wilh any hope, wc don't have lo 
wait another ttvo year^ for them 
to just keep getting better.

IPFW dominates No. 12 Ball State in final home match 




iPFWs Matl Zbyszewski (11) and Serdar Sikca (13) go up for , 
□ck during Salurday's match against No. 11 Ball State at the Gates down 
inter. The Dons lopped the Cardinals in their final home ma 
s season 30-24, 31-29, 30-25. 



Fresh off of Friday nigtit's thrce- 
sct domination of Rutgers, the 
Mastodons look to the court (or Seruor 
Nigtii, wtxich marked the last home 
match in the careers of Jeff Plak. 
Arcanecl Ruiz and Rhyen Staley. 

Ttk trio was pumped for the cru- 
cial match as were the Elons fans who 
came out in full force. IPFW did not 
disappoint as they gave the fans a 30- 
24, 31-29, 30-25 vietoty. 

An extra-zealous bunch of fans 
came prepared with aislom painted T- 
shirts that spelled "Mastodons kick sus 
culos" when they stood in a line. These 
fans presented a thorougtiiy enlcrtain- 
mg cheer routine that included sit-ups 
and push-ups after big kills, swing 
dancing, a simulated machine gun 
massacre and performances of the 
"worm" dance popularized by World 
Wrestling Enlettamment star Scolty 
'Too Holt&gt;'" Taylor. 

"It means a lot to play in front of a 
beautiful croivd like this.' Staley said. 
"Especially against Ball Stale." 

What some of the fans' shirU said 
(translation illegal) is precisely tvhat 
theDonsdid, They won point one off a 
middle set from Dennis Santiago to 
Sikca and never looked back. 

Ptak dominated Came I wittt nine 
kills and a block. Zbyszewski laid in 
wail, only collecting one kill, bul he 
would shine later in the malch. 

The hielUight of the first game 
came as the Dons led 26-22. Ruiz lofted 
his traditional perilously tugh serve 
toss, elevated and smashed the ball 
which landed on top of the net. 
stopped cold and dropped straight 
'" " "" the Cardinals' side for an ace. 
malch was full of pleasant 
iurprises like electricity lor the build- 
ng, which was not prescnl the prior 



right. Play on the court revealed 
another surprise. IPFW defended and 
attacked Itie middk' belter than thev 
had all vear, lallv.ng 30 blocks and led 
bv SikcJ witli I'lRhl. 

'I think Lhe things we've b^en 
talking about in practice and studying 
on video tape have translated success- 
fully |to the court|." said IPFW coach 
Arrue Ball. 

The Dons' passing has improved 
greatly smcc the low of the Lcv^s 
match and was on display. IPFW only 
tallied four service return errors in the 
match, and most of the passes floated 
like rainboivs straight to Santiago. 

"Passing is the key. If we pass 
well, everything else just floivs," Staley 
said. "We were able to gel into a 
rhythm and that was a big advantage." 

The Dons capitalized off of po&lt;&gt;r 
serving from Ball Slate which tot.ik-,!

After shutting out Chicago 
State 9-0 and 5-0 on Saturday at 
the IPFW baseball field, the 
Dons braved Sunday's frigid 
temperatures lo battle the

header in as many days. And the 
results were the same: a pair of 
shutouts, 2-0 and 1-0.

Gernon was particularly 
pleased wilh Ihe Dons' pitching 
Staff, tvhich allowed just 10 hits 
for thetveekcnd. 

"The pitching has been

shut somebody out is difficult, 
and to do il four times. I don't

he said. "I might have to make

lo see a lot of mns scored. 

"Because the pitcher is 
moving on eiery pilch, he's the 
loosest, hottest guy on the field, 
so il was a pitcher's weekend," 
he said. ~With hitters, if vou can 
get inside, you can jam them up 
and their hands are stinging and 
rattling a little bit even with 
aluminum bats. The stage was 
set for some pitching perform- 
ances, and when the fights came 
on, we had rehearsed our lines 
well enough and put on a pretty

something about playing at

it's like having a tenth man. 
There's security. Your guys are

In the opener, the Dons' 
Jason Horvath pitched a com- 
plete game two-hitler. He struck 
oul seven batters and tvalked one. 

Chicago State's Nicholas

I'm not a hick 



Amazingly, il's not even [usi bias Iowa 
the athletes that crcales this huge i^ue. 

Yes. yes. Ever&gt;'one seems lo hold some 
prejudice against some gioup of fans. The 



fit any ql Ihenv Sorr^- to disappoinl 

vout set thinking of a NASCAR fan. 

but I'm not a eountij- boy or a hillbilly. 

For example, in last week's edition 

of The Communicalor. a slory about the 

Kenny Chesney concert at the 

Memorial Coliseum was featured. 

And in that stoiy. a co-worker of mine 

wnDle, "In many (vays. the event ivos 

like a NASCAR race. Thousands ol 

eager fans assembled themselves 

aroimd the center arena, a beer in one 

hand and a lO-gallonhal in the other" 

Sure, il has been a while since I was 

last in attendance al an auto race, as far 

back as the June Michigan race in 1993, but 

1 don'l recall that scenario being played 

oul, I watched lasl weekend's race in 

Talladega, and even there, the only cowboy 

hat I saw on my screen was that of liichard 

Petty 

The whole beer thing, that's another 



it-mocked fans? Those who frequent the slory. Sure. NASCAR fens 



high-speed Iracks of the NASCAR i 

Now me, I'm a fan ol auto racing, 1 
have been for 13 year^, since I was only six. 
But I have never been sauare dancing. 1 
never have oivned a cowboy hat. I don'l 
{nor have 1 ever) li\'ed in a trailer court. I 
don'l have a pick-up truck. I don'l have 
relations with anyone in my own bloodline, 
and dammit. I'm not a hick. 

But, that's whal most people seem lo 
think about fans of NASCAR. By all means. 
I'm not saying that any of those traits arc 
bad (well some obviously arc}, but 1 don'l 



■vel ir 



ing alcoholic beverages. Hence why Miller, 
Budweiser and other beer sponsors have 
been in this for the long haul. But how is 
this different from any other form of 
entertainment? 

Let's have a reality check for once: 
people like to imbibe alcohol at athletic 
events. Why do you think that the 
Coliseum charges an outrageous amount 
for one plastic cup? It's sure not because 
nobcKly is buying it. Alcohol goes hand in 
hand with athletics. I didn't make the rules, 
and 1 may not follow them, but it's hotv the 
world works. 



Sun:. NASCAR's history comes from 
the south, making it an obv'iou:^ brunt of 
hillbilly lokes, but hoiv docs thai make it 
righl? The Winston Cup circ\iit has its fait 
share of drivei^ from Kentucky or the 
Carolirus who talk ivilh a southern drawl 
(sometimes even Forrest Gump-like — ™u 
know what I mean. Wanl Burton). But docs 
that make them, let alone the rest of the cii^ 
cuil or its fans, trailer trash'? 

In that same misguided article. Ihc 
writer went on to explain the concert in 
radxiR temvi, evvr\ using terminology of a 
Dale tamhardl/Ieff Cordon battle (some- 
thing that happened the weekend before). 
These lead me to think that the writer may 
even know something about auto racing. 
So why the bashing? 

I sit here now the same way I do whei\ 
i watch a race at home or I would on a day 
at the track: l-shiM, jeaiw, tattooed, pierced 



Sure, some of you who can't formulate 
your own opinion may say that I'm one in 
a milliorL But my dad's been a fan since the 
'60s, and he fits none of the stereotypes 
(except that he's from the country). 

So as you make your misguided nnd 
blind judgments about any kind of fan or 
athlete, no matter the sport, remember that 
you mav be (vrong. No, the stereotypes of 
racing fans don't hurt my feelings. At the 
end of the day, I'm proud losay I am a rac- 
ing fan and oven more proud to say 
dammit. I am not a hick.

situation, and he just jammed 
some fastballs in there and struck 
out the next two guys. That real-
