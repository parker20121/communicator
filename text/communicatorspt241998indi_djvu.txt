departments of 
chemistry, biology 
and geoscicnces. 

1 1 also has 
ofiices for 55 faculty 
memben. five class laboratories. 27 
nonclass lab^ and 16 general educa- 
tion classrooms as well. 

This achievement was a project 
that began in die early 90s, thanks to 
the combined cffons of local legisla- 
tors, including Van Coufoudakis, 
dean of the School of Arts and 
Sciences; Frank Paladino. chair of 
die department of biology and Scott 
Argasi, chair of the dcpaitnient of 
geo sciences, 

"It is easier to conduct labs and 
do research," Argast said. 

The 21si-cenlury building 



includes statc-of-die-an tcchnolog&gt; 
for each department. 

The building has new equipmeni , 
for example electron microscopes 
for microanalysis, and various speci- 
mens for each depanmenl. 

The rooms have a good ventila- 
tion system for projects. 

There is also equipment for com- 
puter data handling.

the new addition on campus. 

"If you want a hfetime of pros- 
perity, grow educated men and 
women. This reflects Uie reality of 
IPFW's growth strength, depdi and 
breadth. This is a dream that many 
worked hard for." said Brand.

by Carrie Anne Leathers 



In die upcoming mondis. orchids, live owls. 
and aromatherapy will all be featured in dilTerent 
programs at ihc Foellingcr-Freimann Boianical 
Conservatory, 

Other displays for cacti and also for orchids 
will be on exhibit, not to mention the usual show- 
case enhibit^. 

"We are trying lo appeal to a wider audience 
than we have in the past," Community 
Involvement Specialist for the Conservatory 
Pcnm Sims said "We are trying to diversify our 
programs. Rebecca Canales (Education/Public 
Information Coordinator for the Conservatory) 
has lots of connections, expertise, and back- 
ground to pull ideas from." 

Beginning Saturday, the newest showcase 
will open, ihemed Arabian Nights. 

The display will be an interpretation of the 
famous courtyard gardens of the Persian Empire. 
"The Persians literally emersed themselves in 
their courtyards," Sims said. "It is our best inter- 
pretation of what one of those gardens would 
look like, accentuated with our annual mums 
display." 

Besides the normal routine of the showcase 
display, the Conservatory will also be inviting the 
Raptor Chapter back for a special Halloween 
activity and demonstration Friday, Oct. 30. 

The Raptor Chapier will be bringing live 
owls to share with the audience, 

"We were trying to come up with something 
Halloweenish and owls arc pan of the good side 
of Halloween." Sims said. "I diink that by leam- 
bg about the two together {Halloween and owls). 
and the owl's pan in die ecological chain. I think 
it can honestly help people to understand how 
important living organisms are to the universe." 

Other upcoming demonstrations and lectures 
include the topics of water gardens, contempo- 
rary landscape m gardenmg, and aromatherapy 
Helen Na.sh, author of various water garden- 



ing books and magazine editor of Helen Nash's 
Pond &amp; Garden, will be giving die lecture about 
water gardens on Saturday, Oct. 3. 

■"Water gardens are on the rise and kind of 
trendy right now," Sims said. "We feel very for- 
tunate to have someone with her expertise speak- 
ing at the Conservatory." 

Professor of landscape architecture at Purdue 
University. Greg Pierccall. will be giving the lec- 
ture on "The Art of Gardens." Saturday, OcL 10. 

Pierceall will be using slides to address the 
use of hne, form, color, and texture as design ele- 
ments for landscaping. 

"We are working in cooperation with the Fort 
Wayne Museum of An and so are excited about 
bringing in a more diverse audience," Sims said. 
"We are trying to bring in people to speak that we 
feel the community would have an interest in." 

As a certified aromatherapist and message 
therapist. R,N. Janet Carroll, Education Director 
of Vibrant Life Resources School of Wholistic 
Hcaldi. will teach about die three types of aro- 
ma dierpay. 

Those in attendance will be able to expeii- 
ment with the beneficial effects of holistic 
aromadierapy, 

"Janet. iJie presenter, comes highly recom- 
mended." Sims said. "She does presentations and 
is very knowledgeable about 
botanicals," 

Other smaller displays of cacti (Oct. 11) :md 
orchids {Oct 3-4) will also be at Ihc 
Conservatory in the upcoming months. 

One of the Co nser\'a lory's biggest fundraisers 
is also approaching. 

"The Wonderland of Wreaths is a fundraiser 
done by our Conservateers, an incredible group 
of volunteers that help raise funds for the 
Conservatory." Sims said. 

"Over one hundred wreaths are donated and 
displayed (at the Conservatory) and then bid on 
by silent auction. It begins on Nov. 25 and runs 
through Dec. 6." added Sims. 

Admission for this event is S3 for adulLs and 
S2 for sludenLs (high school or college).

Student Activities 
brings comedian 
to campus 



by Carrie Anne Leathers 

Chef Reponer 

Comedian Rondell Sheridan 
will be performing at IPFW on 
Tuesday. Sept, 20, at 7 p.m. as pan 
of the university's effon to entenain 
the student body and community. 

Sheridan was selected from var- 
ious performers at the National 
Association of Campus Activities, 
where the Student Activities Board 
selects many of IPRV's programs. 

"We saw him at NACA and he 
was just a riot." Head of Student 
Activities Ryan Smith said. "It's 
been ahnost a year since I've seen 
him and I still think it was 
hilarious," 

This is only one of many slops 
of Sheridan's tour of campuses. 
Besides his past appearances on 
■'The Tonight Show," "Conan 
O'Brian," "Arsenio Hall," "Evening 
at the Improv," and "MTV Half 
Hour Comedy Hour," Sheridan is 
touring campuses for additional 
publicity. 

"Tliisisjust a part of his promo- 
tional efforts," Smidi said. "We 
expect 10 see a lot of students attend, 
but also faculty, because Sheridan is 
a well-knowTi name. We try to cater 
10 all of die students, but this is also 
something we are doing for the 
community." 

Besides bringing Sheridan to 
the campus to perform, die Student 
.Activities Board has been providing 
tree emcrtainmeni to the student 
body since die beginning of the fall 
semester. 

In total, diere will have been 12 
to 13 events for die fall. 

"We had Reactor: Virtual 
Reality, Tonic Sol Fa (an acappela 
singing group), and free food during 
die first week of classes," Smidi 



•wild, "It's all free for students (widi 
IPFW ID) because everything we do 
is paid for by student fees." 

Coming up over Fall Break, 
Student Activities will be taking two 
chartered buses full of students to 
Chicago for shopping ; 
the Jenny Jones Show. 

There will also be a Halloween 
in Vegas activity in the ballroom on 
Oct. 27, and an appearance in 
November from Primal Urge 
employees to discuss body piercing 
and tattooing. 

"I diink Primal Urge is going to 
do a discount for us (on the IPFW 
ID card)," Smidi said. "We try to 
use all kinds of groups in our 
programming. 

Primal Urge is just one business 
among almost 30 others thai has 
been added to die already 20 to 30 
businesses offering discounts lo stu- 
dents carrying dicir IPFW ID, 

"We've got a lot of sponsor.ship 
from the community." Smith said. 
"At Domino's on Goshen road, a 25 
percent discount will be taken off of 
all carry out orders." 

Sometime near die middle of 
next week, the list of businesses 
offering discounts will be finalized. 

Students may pick die list up at 
either the Walb Union Information 
desk, die Ketiler Infomiation desk, 
or die Student Government office 
located in room 225 of Walb Union. 

Sheridan's appearance "will be 
one more event that we have put on 
for Ihe student body as well as the 
community," Smith .said. "In the 
future we'd even like lo take a 
group of students to Oprah, but it's 
just an idea we are throwing around 
right now," 



out such fundraisers or help from the 
Conservateers. 

"The Conservateers keep die Conservatory 
going. There aren't more than .seven paid employ- 
ees working at die Conservatory," Rice said. "But 
diere are a couple hundred volunteers." 

Besides the Wonderland of Wreadis fundrais- 
er, the used plant sale is also an important 
fundraiser and even, for the Conservatory. 

"We have one after each showcase is done." 
Rice said. "Anybody who is interested in having 
flowers and pretty gardens should definilcly con- 
sider checking out die used plant sale." 

Aldiough it will be too cold for the mums to 
bloom this year, they can still be planted now and 
expected to bloom next year in the garden. 

They are still in good condition. 

"I have some hyacinths that I brought home 
from the used plant sale 10-12 years ago and they 
are still blooming every year," Rice said. 'The 
prices at the used plant sale are unreal. If people 
don't take advantage of what's there, they are 
missing a great opportunity." 

Some plants will be as low as S.50 and S2 and 
all die proceeds from sales are put back into the 
Con.scrvatory's funds. 

For information on purchasing tickets for any 

of the special programs, call 427-6444. 

Otherwi.sc. daily admission price for adulLs is 
$2.75, for students S2. and for children age four 
through grade 5 the cost is S1.50. 

"In terms of economics, we really try to pro- 
mote our evenUi and our showcases to outlying 
areas to hopefully bring people here for a week- 
end, and as a result the city benefiLs from them 
being in town and renting a motel, eating here, 
and shopping here. It's a tangible way that we can 
help the city," Sims said. 

"Also, we are really trying to educate the 
youth about plants and just to have this cultural 
center that .schools and church groups can use is 
quite beneficial."

In Clinton's four-hour depo-

any kind of sexual relations v.iih 
Monica Lewinsky including 
phone sex, touching various 
pans of her body, or using a cigar 
as a sexual aid. 

Most of Clinton's deposition 
seemed as if he was dodging the 
issues and giving long-winded 
responses to simple questions.

thing to come out in 
the public airing of all 
of Clinton's "dirly 
laundry." A few 
weeks ago ii was the 
SiaiT report, which 
was posted on the 
Internet, and now you 
can find a copy of the 
video deposition on 
the Iniemei. 

To top it off, there 
are rumors thai you 
can pick up a copy of 
the video at 
Blockbuster video locations. 

Just a final illusuaiion of how car- 
ried away the media has gotten with 
Clinton's sex life, there is now an 
Adult-rated video called "Sex, Lies, 
and The President" with a lead charac- 
ter who bears a slight resemblance to 
President 



So I'm moseying out to my car today after 
class .-md I got thinking. Now there is a word, got. 
that LS worth talking about. Avon, a former gram- 
mar professor of mine who was a grammar guru 
and a tnic stickler for dctaiK and Brandi, a fellow 
student in that class who mercilessly hounded me 
for 16 weeks to improve my gratrunar skills, could 
have a field day with me on the usage of the word 
here, (if they catch me). 

Anyway, back lo what I was saying. I was 
diinking lots of different thoughLs, but my biggest 
thought was "Just what the heck am 1 doing out 
here anyway?" After aimlessly walking around the 
parking garage for a good 15 minutes, up and 
down several floors, and without any success in 
finding my trusty dusty gray van, it suddenly 
occurred to me that I was in the wrong place. My 
precious Matilda (my endearment for the van thai 
must last until I finish my mission) is in the other 

^_^_ parking garage (which I think is about two more 

by Denny She, Edrtorlal Cartoonist ""'^^ ^^^X f™"" ^'^ campus). I had to park there 
because 1 was almost late getting to campus due to 
the fog, and the drive is over a half hour, which is 
another story all in itself. 

To be sure though, 1 was now on my way 
home when 1 saw a billboard .sign that beckoned 
me with the question. "Can you read this?" Huh, 
can 1 read this? Can I read this? What the heck do 
you mean, can 1 read this? Of course I can read 
this. I'm reading it, aren't P You bet your sweet 
bippy I can read this. I can read just about any- 
thing. That's all 1 do is n:ad. Read! ReadI Read! 
That's all I ever have time to do. Well, that and 
write (about things that I have read). 

Okay, 1 have been watching the home run 
chase, which is now a race, but instead of reading 
between innings, like most people probably do, I 
only have time lo watch die ai-bals of Slammin' 
Sammy and Big Mac between chapters. You talk 
about screwed up priorities. 

The real reason for this problem can be traced 
lo the heavy cla.ss load 1 am taking. More specifi- 
cally a particular literature class. All we do in this 
class is read a novel; talk about the novel: analyze 
die novel; write about the novel; and then get test- 
ed on the novel. When wo arc finished with one 
iiovcl, we start another novel. li's a never ending 
battle. 

Al the end of each novel, I am pretly sure I can 
reciie Ihe novel better than the authors, most of 
whom, by the way, are dead. In some cases, for 
almost three hundred years. 

And don't get me started on ibe professors out

Clinton. 

We dori'i ihink thai Clinton is 
going to be impeached. Everyone 
knows that he isn't the greatest person, 
so just let him finish out his term. 

The impeachment process will 
probably lake a year or more, so do we 
just let Al Gore riin ihe-country for a 
few mondis? We don't think Gore 
could do as well with the office of the 
president as Clinlon, sorry to say. 
So what do we do from here? Just 
stop talking about it. It's plain and 
simple. We have heard enough about 
what Clinlon may have done with 
one of cigars and what was on 
Monica's dress. 

The best way to stop hearing 

about this is to stop talking about 

It. It's simitar to what some of us 

were taught in high school about 

sex. Abstinence is best. Sure, all of 

this gives us something to write 

'■out, but even we have had enough. 

Hopefully, we are reaching the end 

of all of this mess. We know that it isn't 

too likely, but hope is all that we have. 



here cither. Oh. my! Oh. my! They range from 
being young enough to be my daughter to older 
than my Great-Grandad. I'm serious! There is this 
one profes.sor. in one of my writing courses, who 
has a Masters Degree. She has been teaching out 
here for two years already, and she only graduated 
from high school in this decade. 

Another professor has been teaching here so 
long he can remember when the only building out 
here was Kettier Hall. Now that is ancient! I don't 
sLind a chance. It makes me wonder just what in 
the heck have I been doing with my life? Oh yeah. 
raising kids, serving my country (anybody remem- 
ber the Gulf War?), stuff like that. But that was a 
long lime ago. It doesn't count. Because, after all, 
I am still in college. 

I'm still a college student. Do you know what 
that sounds like at my age? My academic adviser 
says not to worry. He says that he can see ihc light 
allhecndof the tunnel forme and he doesn't think 
it's a train, I am not so easily convinced. 

When I transferred in to this college, they only 
took in about halfof the college credit hours I had 
already earned, and Ihose were from another major 
university. I am pretty sure that now the reason for 
this is twofold. One. is to keep me hostage here 
forever, and two. is to keep the acronym true to 
form You know, "1 Paid For What?" (IPFW), keep 
up with me now. But I guess I am getting an edu- 
cation. 

At least my Educational Psychology courses 
are paying off Now that my kids are over half 
grown, 1 know why I had/have to scream al them. 
and why I screamed at them to get anything done 
in my house. I bet that I am going to be a dam 
good grandparent someday (but that belter be a 
long time coming), I'm telling you. 

Okay, so I am rambling on here. I got lo quit 
thai, which brings me back to dial word "got" 
again, which brings me back to Avon, and Brandi. 
and all die odier Secondary Education Majors thai 
I hang around wiih. Then I remember what it is 
that brings me back to this campus week after 
week, 1 am going lo be a teacher., It won't be long 
now. I will be ordering a cap and gown, maybe 
even a ring... Okay, 1 siill have a lilile over a year 
to go, but a guy can dream can't he? I can't wait 
for them to call my name and hand me a scroll. I 
know dial 1 have earned it. When this happens, the 
first thought that will come to my head will be. "I 
got what it takes!" This gets me back lo diinking 
about Avon and Brandi....

is usually that on most of 
the talk shows the host ot

Most of Ihc people are 
screwed up anyways, bui 
to add someone there lo

really makes me sick lo 
the stomach (if you have 
ever talked with me you 
know that IS hard lo do). 
It seems like all 
that the show does is find

thai 

ploit are real people 
who have some kind of 
physical problem wtilch 
makes Ihem different 
from everyone else. The 
talk show hosts aUempi 
to show some kind of 
sympathy toward that 
person. None of the sym- 
pathy seems real. The 
host might as well say, 
"Look at Ibis freak," 
That's whoi mosi people 
take away from the show, 
and that isn'IrighL 



It 



tike 



very other day there are 



new shows coming up. Rosannc BniT or whatever her 
name is now has a show, Al the end of one of her shows 
she had all of these kids that lived in a special shelter 
because Ihey couldn"! handle living with their parents or 
in other shelters. Rosanne went person by person and 
aiked Ihcm why Ihey lived Ihcre. Most of Ihem had sad 
stories about how their parents were mean and evil or 
bow ihey were messed up or something. TTicn she went 
back to each person and asked Ihem where they were 
going lo be in ii» months. They aU said thai they hope to 
have all of Iheir problems resolved, Roseannc used the 
standard emotion-gelling lools by just asking two simple 
quesQons. I almost fell sorry for the kids. Then it 
appeared to me that Roseanne didn'l really care for the 
kids, and Ijusi thought "What a crock of !©«% '" 

These talk shows have been around for quite a while 
now. It doesn't seem like anything is gelling better with 
them cither. 

The one show that I have been alile lo sil through 
somclimcs is the Oprah Winfrey show. I can sit there until 
she docs something silly like have a kid on ihe show 
whose first name is 100 letters long. Stupid things like 
thai dnve me nuis. Why can't people have enough sense 
to name ihcif kids a reasonable name. Can you imagine 
bow that kid is going to feci when she has to apply for a 
job or fmanciaj aid or jusi write her name al the top of her 

Maybe Us noi totally the bosl's faull Ihal Ihc shows 
are so screwed up. but rather the people thai actually do 
the stupid Ihingi that give ihe hosis something to talk 

You can't really talk about something if it doesn't 
happen. So slop sleeping wiih your e»-boytriend, having 
set with more than one person so you know who the 
falherof your child is. joining any lype of hate group, and 
jusi simply try to gel along wiUi people, that would get rid 
of about half of Ihe topics that ihe lalk show hosis have to 
talk aboul. Irom now on I am jusi going keep my cheap 
lelevision tuned lo channel 03 &lt;1 don't have cable), and 
just waicb all of the videos thai I have and rem video 
games and spoil my mind in more constructive arxl less

What's Weak this Week 



by Dennis Donahu&lt; 



Just to get a few things straight 



A few people have approached mc and cynicism: i juM have an abra- 
in the hallways and asked mc lo sive sense of humor. 



wriie aboui some things Ihai both- 
ered them. 1 usually say, " Mcy 
thanks for reading, bui the paper 
would love 10 bear from you " 

I'm shocked thai people even 
know who I am, 1 also receive e- 
mail from some of you, mosi of ii 
preily good. However, there are 
some people out there who don'i 
understand what T am trying lo write 
aboul. 

First and most obvious, I'm not 
an English or journalism major 
Seconilly, I don'i find the world 
around mc to be full of morons, 
jerks and irresponsible dotes. 



I sleep pretty good at night know- 
ing that (here are more good people 
than bad people walking the su'ects 
of the planet we live on. If I notice 
thai a majority of people are doing 
something (hat I feel is lame. I write 
about ii. This doesn't always seem 
popular, but il is the chance I take. 

Most of the subject matter is 
based on current events cither here 
al school locally, or even on a 
national news slory. 1 don'i like gel- 
ling into touchy things such as sex- 
uality or religion. These things seem 
too personal. 

Some of you like expressing 



I seem to have the knack for your sexuality and religion and 
noticing the bad things; and I call that's fine. 1 don'i really care aboui 
'em a.^ I see 'cm. Finally. I'm not what you do in the bedroom or in 
your house of worship. In fact, 1 
don't want to know what you do. 

I try to write about the "other" 

things. You know, fashion, manners, 

nds, fads, and the things that 

make up our American society. 

I llie boring, mundane and trivial 

seem to scream at mc everyday. 

This is what I notice the most. The 

absurd and odd nuances that many 

people partake in just amazes me so 

much that I have to Like the lime to 

svritc il down. 

I probably offend some people 
with the things 1 write aboul. Maybe 
it's because 1' ve called ihem out and 
made them look foolish, of course. 




not iiiientionally. 1 don't sit ai my 
computer trying to upset people. I 
don'i iry lo hurl people's feelings. 
I'm just trying 13 make people think, 
and of course, laugh. 

Thai is the main reason for this 
column.' lo make people laugh, 
especially ai themselves. I do some 
of the stupid things thai I write 
aboul. And inisi me, it hurls, but I 
can still laugh ai myself. 

I know I'm not perfect, but I 
have a sense of humor about it. I'm 
very comfortiible with all of my 
imperfections. So, if for some rea- 
son you feel insulted by what I have 
written, quit reading the column, or 
jusi laugh il off and go on living. 
Forgive me, I'm just trying to pad 
my resume. 

So for all of the nice e-mail, 
"TTiank you." I'll do my besi to 
answer all of il. And for all of ibe 
negative criticism, well, thanks. I 
guess. 

Remember, this isn't the New 
York Times, don't lake il so serious. 
If you spend more time smiling, life 
will be easier for everyone. 

Whais weak this week? Lei's talk 
aboul "cool" people. Not real people 
thai are cool like die Beastie Boys. 
Sam Jackson, Janene Garafalo and 
Sammy Sosa Bui those people that 
think they are cool. 

You know, driving low in dieit 
car with really crappy music blaring 
out the window. Those "cool" 



chicks thai stand outside of Ketller 
using really bad language, and 
wearing the birjmc clodies (sony, 
but I'm old fa.shioned). 

The baggy pants, underwear 
exposed, chain- wal lei- wearing, 
Mouniain Dew drinking lough-guys. 
The Jerry Springer mindset that the 
more obnoxious you arc the more 
"cool" you are. Thasc really "cool" 
DJ's at some of our local drinking 
cstablishmenis, who jusi love lo 
hear themselves talk while spinning 
horrible tunes. 

"Cool" radio stations like 96.3 
FM. They play like eight songs in 
heavy rotation, for well over a 
month. How can people even listen 
to them? I think CD's have ten or 
twelve songs on them, why play 
only two or three? 

"Cool" isn't what your wear. 
drive, or talk, " Cool" doesn't have 
anything lo do with what you drink, 
where you hang out, or who you 
know. It isn't a "way of life" or an 
"atlilude" ihai you emit lo everyone. 
"Cool" isn'l how you treat people or 
how you're treated. Cool is more 
associated widi doing good, than 
doing bad. 

Mother Theresa was cool. 
Sunny days are cool. Baseball is 
cool again. Recycling is very cool. 
Try to remember that there is a dif- 
ference between "cool" and fun. 
You might like lo do things becau.sc 
it makes you seem cool. But you are 



probably doing il because it is fun, 
or ai least you think it is. 

Being trendy, doesn't make you 
cool, it makes you trendy. I&gt;riving 
fast around campus on your motor- 
cycle doesn't make you "cool". It 
makes you an idiot on a motorcycle. 
I'm not very "cool". Sometimes 1 
think I'm "cool". I'm too uptight lo 
be cool. A rule of thumb on cool- 
ness; If you think you're a cool per- 
son, you more than likely aren't. 
Thai is one of the cool things aboul 
being cool; you don't even know it. 
And that is really cool. 

Loser of the Week- The local 
music scene. Not the actual bands. 
but some of the acts that are booked 
here. Could we gel jusi a little less 
country here and some more curreni 
bands? Il's either Reba or KarLsas. 
Pop or Christian rock. 1 bei the 
Coliseum could do better than 
Journey. I heard they will be wiihoui 
former lead singer Sieve Perry; why 
even go? If you can, check out The 
Jesus and Mary Chain tonight at 
Piere's. 

Trusi me. They rock, and they 
are an original band. If you've never 
heard of them, diey are sort of a 
cross between Melallica and the 
Pumpkins. I know it sounds weird. 
bui ihey are greai. They've been 
around for over ten years. Fifteen 
buck,s, don't mis.s il. Have a great 
weekend, be nice. Go Irish !

Elusive Destiny, Part Five: Happiltj tver After 



by Adam Tnylor 



The morning came like a bas- 
lion of misery for Tun as tie rolled 
himself QUI of bed. 

YesicrJay saw rejeclion for him 
ai the hands of what he'd believed 
was one of the mosl impressive 
women he had ever mei. 

The night bad been a long one 
for him as he speni ihc evening 
compleiely sober analyzing his life. 

Aflcr hours of trying to figure 
oui his problem, he found sleep with 
grcal case as he resolved ii was jusi 
bad timing, and there wasn't any- 
thing wrong with him. 

Too bad he didn't feel the same 
way now as he did before he fell 
asleep. 

With a sigh, he shut die door to 
his bedroom and went into the 
kitchen where be saw his roommate 
silting at the tabic having breakfast 

"Good momin' man," Tim ^aid 
to his roommate as Tmi went to fix 
a bowl of cereal. "Early night last 
nighi?" he asked Mark with sur- 
pri.scd eyes. 

"Yeah, figured I'd hang out a lit- 
de before I went to work," Mark 
relumed with a still-groggy slow- 
ness. "What was all that about last 
night before I left?" Mark asked. 

"Oh yeah, 1 wanted to apologize 
forthat. Kindofhadaroughday. ya 
know?" Tun casually said. "I really 
didn't want (o lake it oui on you." 



"Don't worry about it, man. 
What happened?" 

"Well, you remember die dream 
girl I was gonna ask out?" Tim said 
as he sat down. "1 did it, dude. 1 
a'Jcedher out." 

"AndT' 

"And she said no. No reasott, no 
hint as to why, just no. Can you 
believe that?" 

"Thai's too bad, man. I don'i 
know what lo say," Mark said, vy- 
ing lo shuffle around the conversa- 
tion in his head. "Win .some, lose 
some I guess. Oh yeah, 1 saw Dave 
yesterday and he was wantin' you to 
call him. He's wanlin' to get togeth- 
er tonight and hang out. Feel like 
goin' to the bars? It may do you 
some good," 

"No, not really. Think I'm just 
gonna hang out here tonight," Tun 
said widi indifference. 

"Are you sure? Come on, man, 
you know what they say. Fall ofi" the 
horse, gel right back on it. It'll be 
fun, trust me," 

"No, that's all right, You all go 
out and have a good time. I think 1 
might clean up around here a bit 
lonighL" 

"Well, if you're sure," Mark 
trailed off. He saw his friend was 
pretty set in his decision, so he 
decided he'd leave it at that. "I 
probably won't be home until late, 
so if anyone calls tell them I'll call 
Uiem back tomorrow." 

"I can do that," Tim replied as he 
put hLs empty dishes in die sink "I 
gotta go get ready for work, man. If 
you leave, make sure you have your 



keys 'cause I probably won't be 
here when you gei back." 

"Sounds cool," Mark said, sitting 
down to waich some early morning 
television. Drifting off to sleep, he 
didn't hear Tim leave as he wan- 
dered his way out the door. At least 
it isn't yesterday anymore, Tim 
thought to himself. From now on. 
things can only get belter. 

Michelle found the way to work 
to be exceptionally nerve racking. 

The Iraffic was decent, but dur- 
ing the eniire drive, all she could 
think about was what Tim had asked 
her on her way out the door the day 
before. 

She had doubts as lo whether or 
not she had made the right decision 
in turning him down, but still she 
just couldn't say yes. 

She barely knew this person, 
after all. and was still unsure about 
whether or not he would end up 
being like her en-boyfriend Aaron. 
All she really knew was thai 
ihey had some things in cottunon, 
and that he was a drinker, just as 
Aaron had been. 

As she pulled up to the office, 
she saw Tim's car and her heart 
sank to her stomach. She feared the 
day that lie ahead of her 

As il lumed out, however, there 
wa.s really nothing to fear. 

Michelle and Tim got along per- 
fectly, as if her rejecting him for a 
dale diat weekend was all just an 
illusion. She caught him staring at 
bee a few times, but beyond that 
nodiing seemed to get in the way of 
their work. 



Renowned writers 
for Visiting Writers 



Tim found the work atmosphere 
quite nice himself. 

Although it killed him thai diis 
woman considered herself "off lim- 
iLs" to him, he did enjoy being 
around her quite a blL 

He found that they made pretty 
good friends. As the weeks crept by, 
he found himself talking to her 
more and more about the deeper 
things in life until preuy soon he 
couldn't wail lo gel lo work every 
morning. 

He cut back his drinking sub- 
sianiially, and he had gone from 
drinking nearly every night lo no 
more than once or twice a week. 

The new friend he found in 
Michelle had taken the place of his 
old love of drinking, giving him a 
feeling of comfon inside he'd never 
experienced before. 

Michelle fell the same way. 
Never before had work been as 
enjoyable as it was now with Tim. 

Her doubts about him dwindled 
more and more every day uniil one 
day she found herself staring at him 
with a smile on her face for no real 
reason. 

The feeling was so new lo her 
that .she had a hard lime understand- 
ing it. 

When she would lalk to her 
friends on die phone at night all she 
would talk about was Tim. They 
asked her if she and Tim were dat- 
ing, and she didn'i know how to 
answer 

She wanted desperately to go 
out with him, but she didn't tjuile 
know how to ask him. especially

before. 

Nearly a month to die day dial 
he'd initially a.sked her out, though, 
the problem would meet its end. 

As the rain poured down, Tim 
and Michelle shared an umbrella 
out to the parking lot. and Tun wait- 
ed, holding the umbrella, as 
Michelle got into her car. 

As Tim handed Michelle die 
umbrella, they stood staring ai each 
odier face lo face until Tim leaned 
in and gave her a kiss, 

Michelle, taken by surprise at 
first, quickly recovered and kissed 
Tim back. 

Feeling somewhat woozy. Tim 
stumbled back a little bit and 
regained his composure. "I don't 
suppose you'd be interested in din- 
ner this weekend, would you?" Tim 
said widi sparkling eyes and a wide 
smile. 

"Tim," Michelle replied. "1 



couldn't diink of a better way to 
spend an evening." 

As Ihc two drove off their sepa- 
rate ways, diey bolh smiled all the 
way home. The world had just 
become a little less lonely for the 
bodi of them, and diings were just 
getting underway. Tim and Michelle 
had both finally found love.

Most importantly, the Crawfish Club is a 
place where people can come and enjoy excel-

there is no live music, the jukebox plays 
"zydeco" music that one must hear to appreci-

Siaff Writer 

First, let me say I got some e- 
mail that provided me with two sur- 
prising facts. 

First, then: are a-aily fast com- 
puters in the basements of Neff 
Hall and the Science Building, 

These should be more than ade- 
quate to run the web sites I find. 
Second (and even more surprising), 
i found that people actually read 
my article, 

I cannot approve of this, and 1 
must urge you to skim my article, 
thereby missing the bad grammar, 
misspellings, etc. 

For those of you who have 
decided to keep reading, I have a 
question: Where could one find 
images of our culture in everyday 
things? 

Most would prohiibly say an 
and literature. 1 even heard some- 
one say once that our trash can tell 
us about our culture. 

Bui what about the web? Many 
viewpoints and opinions are 
accounted for somewhere on ihc 
web. 

Still, 1 have a theory that gives 
yes and no type of answers lo that 
question. Yes. we can see different 
.ispects of our culture on the web. 

Bui apparently some of our cul- 
ture's normal people were left out. 



t)ecause many popular sites were 
written by people who are seeming- 
ly either 1.) incredibly smart and 
creative, 2.) humorous and creative. 
or 3.) creative and possibly dis- 
turbed. 

My web sites this week were 
difficult to fmd, so 1 hope you enjoy 
ihcm or ihey at least help you 
become more "cullured." 

htip://www.5sigma,com/joseph/ina 



The title of this page is 
"Inanimate Objects." The page has 
videos of inanimate objects diat are 
shot with various guns. 

Most of the objects are gro- 
ceries. Some of the author's 
weaponry include a ,357 Cor-Bon. 
,357 Glaser, 9 mm hollowpoint, 9 
mm ilomady Vector Tracer, .22 
Stinger, and .45 SXT 

Also, for those into chemistry, 
he has a video of the "reaction" of 
an orange, acetone peroxide, and a 
fuse. Now if we could just gel 
Richard Simmons to bold still for a 
couple of seconds... 

htlp://www.facsiaffbucknel!.edu/c 
astecl/cbem2I2/songs/ 

The title of this page is "Chem 
212 Songs." it contains lyrics to 
songs such as "The Hokey-Pokey," 
using chemistry terminology. 



Chemistry students, lei me ask 
you something: Will you ever truly 

leam Chemistry? Is it even possi- 
ble? No, of course not. The Human 
Genome project will likely find a 
gene that allows one to be a 
chemist. 

Without it, it is futile to try and 
leam ii I happen to have been 
blessed to have a professor such as 
Mr. Friedel, professor of chemistry 
here at TPF\V (extra credit for that 
one), but for the rest of you the 
only alternative to teaming chem- 
istry is to pretend you've Icamed 
it. 

Singing these songs in cla.ss 
may fool your teacher into think- 
ing yon'vc learned chemistry, or it 
mightjusl get you kicked out of 
class. Chances are. you're belter 
off e idler way. 

htlp://www.kissthisguy.com 



This site contains lyrics people 
have mistaken for actual song 
lyrics. Some of these mistaken 
lyrics are reasonable. 

For instance, who can tell what 
Kurl is SCTCiuning in "Teen Spirit"? 
I think it would require Microsoft's 
Terraserver lo list all of the wrong 
lyrics. 

However, some people are 
apparently taking experimental 
drugs or something and somehow 
they came up with some strange 



lyrics. Someone, for example, actu- 
ally thought that the refr^n for 

"Tubthumping" was "I hate No 
Doubt, but I'll get over ii" instead 
of "I get knocked down, but 1 get 
up again."

Sports week wrap up: Cal Ripken Jr. ends streak 



Flo-Jo dies at 38 

The news of Florence Grifiiih- 
Joyner's untimely passing saittJenecl 
the worid of sports 

Joyner died of an appar\:nt hean 
seizure Monday morning in her 
Mission Vicjo, California home. 

Ai press lime ihe results of ihe 
autopsy had not been released, his 
hanl (o believe thai Ihc body of a 
world-cLi.ss aihlcic could fail like 



this, but strangely, it is not all that 
uncommon. 

Reggie Lewis, Hank Gathers, 
and Pete Maravich immediately 
come 10 mind, but many aihleies 
have shared this demise. 

Joyner would have been thirty- 
nine in December. "^ 

You hear about this son of thing 
from lime lo time at the high school 
level as well 

Joyner had experienced an inci- 
dent involving a hean seizure on a 
plane in 1996. 

Ten years ago diis month, she 
won four medals, three gold and one 
silver for the United Stales in the 



1988 Summer Olympic Games in 
Seoul, Korea. 

She leaves behind husband Al 
Joyner and a daughter Mary Ruth. 
seven years oM, as well as thou- 
sands of friends and fans. 

Streak ends at 2,632 

In typical Ripkenesque fashion, 
Cal Ripken took himself out of the 
Orioles lineup Sunday night, ending 
his consecutive games playing 
streak ai 2.632. 

Prior to Sunday, the last time 
Baltimore played a game without 
Cal in the sianing lineup was May 




30. 1982. I was seven. 

The decision was solely 
Ripkens'. who wanted the attention, 
scrutiny and distraction Uiai the 
streak has generated to end. 

Always a fan favorite, Ripken 
waited until the last home game to 
share the moment with the 
Baltimore fans in Camden Yards. 

Simply put Cal Ripken epito- 
mizes class, slating. "I just felt thai 
il was time." 

It is Ripken and not McGwire or 
Sosa who brought many disgruntled 
fans back, while breaking Lou 
Gehrig's previous record of 2.1 30 in 
September of 1995. the season after 
the World Series was canceled. 

Even then, Ripken remained 
unosieniatious. 

Ripken has played 502 straight 
games since breaking the record. To 
pui that in perspective. Ihe current 
longest slreak is only 327 held by 
Chicago White So;i outfielder 
Alben Belle- 
Going, Going, Gone! Maybe 

Umpire Bob David.son is not 
exactly a household name, unless 
Sammy Sosa ends up passing or 
tying Mark McGwire for the home 
run title. If that is the case, then 
Davidson, whose vision is better 
than an eagle's will taavc pbyed an 
integral role. 

On the play, Davidson, a second 
base umpire, hustled out into the 
outfield 10 rule that Lhe potential 
home run was interfered with by a 
fan and was called a ground rule 
double. The alleged home run 
would have been Mac's second of 
the game. The St. Louis Cardinal 
appealed ihc call to the National 
League, but vi^ overruled, with 
oiricials Slating it was a judgement

son, McGwire upstaged Sosa again, 
this lime on "Sammy Sosa Day" at 
Wrigley Field last Sunday. 

ESPN was televising the festiv- 
ities prior to the Cubs game, then 
they cut to the fan friendly split- 
screen so that we could watch Mac's 
at bat in Milwaukee. 

Mac promptly homered #65 and 
the entice picture cut lo McGwire, 
fully into his home run trot. 



Sosa then proceeded to go 0-5 

with two strikeouts as the Cubs 

were swept at home by Cincinnati, 

Unfortunately, the Cubs are 

struggling at the wrung lime. 

They close out the season this 
weekend in Houston. 

They will need help from the 
Braves who play the Mcis in a 
three-game series this weekend.
