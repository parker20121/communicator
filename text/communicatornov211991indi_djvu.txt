not lormally released until earlier this 
month, he says thai athlelic scholar- 
ship funding began last June. 

The second area, regional inlorma- 
llon access, centers around Helmke

lo make information more accessible, 
and to make the library easier to use. 
He leels that ihis aspect ol the cam- 
paign will be directed al everyone wilh- 
In Ihe Northeastern Indiana communi- 
ty, not just students. "This will have a 
very broad appeal." 

Instructional improvement innova- 
tions is the third category, laquinta 
explains that they are currently seeking 
ideas Irom the faculty senate on ways 
to improve the campus. They are ask- 
ing lor proposals (or improvements that 
could be made. 

The last pan, community and univer- 
sity initlalives, is the most complex por- 
lion of the plan, laquinta describes this 
area as improving teaching, public 
service and applied research. Here 
Ihey intend lo have a more narrow goal 
that will "enable us lo improve service 
lo the community and improve educa- 
tion to the sludents." He adds that 
education could become more special- 
ized. 

Although alt ol the details of the lour 
main categories are noi completely 
worked out. laquinta says that solicita- 
tion is Ihe most important aspect of 
making VISION 21 a success, 

'We will be going to Northeastern 
Indiana alumni, and will be approach- 
ing businesses lor donations. We are 
asking everyone to contribute." 
laquinta said. 

laquinta also said that the success ol 
VISIONS 21 relies on years of plan- 
ning, inlense fundraising and motivat- 
ing potential donors lo take an interest 
in the students and faculty. 

"The trick to tundraising is to go with 
what we leel Ihe campus needs and 
what the donors can give. When 
there's a match it's good for everyone," 
laquinta said. 

So far, laquinta has no specific linan- 
cial figures to release on the success 
ol the program He concluded howev- 
er, that *ihe program is going quite well 
and we are nearly half way done. We 
are very pleased," He said that 
although the program is scheduled lo 
continue through the 1993-94 school 
year, fundraising will continue beyond 
that time because 'it is an ongoing pro- 
jsct.'

Campus celebrates past, future of education 



By Mary Shrock 
Staff Writer 

American Education Week is cele- 
brated Nov. 17 Ihrough 23 and is 
aimed at education awareness in ele- 
mentary, middle and high schools 
around the nation. 

The emphasis of Ihe celebration is In 
the Importance education plays not |ust 
in Ihe past or present but also in the 
future of our nation as the annual event 
marks it 70th anniversary 

Creating American Education week 
as a result ol Ihe realized illiteracy of 
the draftees for World War 1. The U.S. 
Office ol Education, the American 
Legion and the National Education 
Association combined their lorces and 



started a new American tradition, 

IPFW sponsors grants, clinics and 
specialized training programs for bolh 
students and teachers, to honor Edu- 
cation Week. 

According to Ken Keller, coordinator 
of counseling for Ihe School of Educa- 
tion, the quality ol teaching administra- 
tion and counselors at IPFW has great- 
ly improved over the last 26 years ol 
his involvement wiih the program, 

Keller is conlident Ihal IPFW's educa- 
tion program is fiist rale. "I'll put our 
education program against any pro- 
gram in the state.' he said. 

"We do a lot ol work for the campus 
not only for education sludents but also 
for the community,' said Janet Jordan, 



director of the curriculum lab for the 
School of Education. 

Graduate students al Ihe Education 
Clinic in Neff Halt provide counseling 
services to elementary, middle and 
high school sludents for both personal 
and social adjustment problems. IPFW 
has one of fourteen programs in Coun- 
selor Education in Indiana. 

George Leddick, co-otdinator for the 
education program in the Graduate 
School at IPFW has Ihis feeling about 
National Education week, "The faculty 
of Ihe School ol Education thinks it's 
important to work wrth the local school 
systems, but we think every week is 
Education Week." 



Four calls 
threaten 
bombing 
in Kettler 



By Jim Walker 
Managing Editor 

IPFW police Sgl. Don Matthews 
says Ihal ihe recent rash of bomb 
threals on campus are not being 
treated like a joke by the campus 
police, 

"When we get a call, the phone 
company is contacted right away 
and they try to trace the call," 
Matthews said. 

If the bomb threat caller is 
caught, Matthews said the Univer- 
sity will prosecute. He said that 
making a bomb Ihreal is a Class D 
felony which can result in two 
years in prison and/or a $10,000 
fine. 

"The callers are probably aware 
thai they can gel into trouble but 
they're not worried about Ihe con- 
sequences at the time. People 
don't usually worry about conse- 
quences when they do something 
stupid like that." 

Nilatthews said that there have 
been four bomb threats on campus 
this semester. The first occurred 
on Oct. 8, which was followed by 
another Oct. 28 and two in Novem- 
ber, on Ihe sixth and seventh. All 
four bomb-threat callers claimed 
Ihal Ihe bomb was in Kettler Hall. 

Matthews said that tour bomb 
threats in a semester is about an 
average total. 

When a bomb threat is called in, 
Matthews said that the campus 
police follow a set procedure. "Our 
stall goes through the building and 
looks for any unusual packages 
and anything that's out of place." 

Matthews said Ihal the procedure 
takes about an hour. During ihis 
time the building must be evacuat- 
ed. 

Most of the bomb threats are 
called in during mid-terms and 
tinals week, Matthews said. "It's a 
nuisance." he said. 



Precedent setting copyright infringement suit decided 



By Tina Holston 
Editor In Chief 

A precedent-setting copyright 
infringement suit involving one ol Ihe 
largest statutory damage awards ever 
granted in a copyright case ended 
recently with the signing of an agree- 
ment between the eight plainlifl pub- 
lishers, Ihe American Association of 
Publishers and the defendant, Kinko's 
Graphics Conaoralion. 

TTie suit was brought against Kinko's 
for producing and selling course pack- 
ets to college students which contained 
copyhghted materials used without per- 
mission, according to a statement 
released by the AAP. 

The case was decided in the publish- 
ers' lavor earlier Ihis year. In addition 
to stipulating specilic monetary dam- 
age and attorneys' fees in Ihis liligalion, 
Ihe agreement spells out the terms that 
will govern relations between Kinko's 
copyshops in the United Stales and 
U.S. publishers both wKhin and outside 



Ihe AAP membership. 

Kinko's was sued lor its practice ol 
unauthorized copying of chapters and 
other multiple page portions ol copy- 
righted books to make anthologies and 
to sell those anthologies lo college slu- 
dents for a profit, according lo Ihe 
statement released Oct. 17. 

In addition to agreeing not to appeal 
the decision, Kinko's will pay a total ol 
$1.S75 million in statutory damages 
assessed by Ihe court and allorney 
lees, said the plaintiffs' statement. 

The AAP staled Ihe court was pre- 
sented with five different anthologies, 
or course packs, made by two Kinko's 
stores in hJew York City. Included In 
Ihe anthologies were excerpts from 12 
different works whose copyrights were 
owned by the eight plaintifis (Harper &amp; 
Row, Basic Books. Prentice Hall, 
McGraw-Hill, John Wiley, Penguin, 
William Marrow, and Richard 0, Irwin). 
The books copied included both In 



and out of print works, trade, profes- 
sional and texl books. The copied 
malerials ranged in length from 14 to 
110 pages, or from five to 24 percent ol 
Ihe works, according lo AAP state- 
ments. 

The New York court found Kinko's 
guilty of copyright infringement. 
Kinko's past practice of creating 
anthologies of substantial portions ol 
copyrighted works without permission 
and selling those anthologies to stu- 
dents violates the copyright law, said 
Ihe court. 

The court also found Ihis was a willful 
inlringemeni and awarded the plaintiffs 
an additional $510,000 in damages; an 
Injunction prohibiting Kinko's Irom con- 
tinuing lo copy and make anthologies 
ol multi-page excerpls whhout permis- 
sion; and ordered Kinko's lo pay the 
plaintiffs' legal fees and court costs. 

The court clearly slated in its deci- 
sion that creating anthologies with per- 



misskin is a regular practice cooperat- 
ed in by publishers. Many custom pub- 
lishers, law-abiding copyshops, college 
stores and other organizations make 
similar course packs by securing per- 
mlssbn and paying royalties. In this 
case, said the court's decision. Kinko's 
violated Ihe taw by not asking for or 
obtaining permission before making the 
anthologies in queslion. 

The coun also expressly noied that 
there is a clear difference between pro- 
viding legitimate anihotogies and pro- 
viding anthologies made without per- 
mlsston. 

The court recognized ihat when 
Kinko's sought permission to copy 
materials, they were granted permis- 
sion oh the same terms offered to oth- 
ers. 

The AAP said this decision will not 
have harmful effects on education. 
"Professors can continue lo assign a 
wide range of materials, and use cus- 



tomized course anthologies made with 
permission as in the pasi.* said Ihe 
AAP statement on the decision. "How- 
ever, the decisbn assures that authors 
and publishers will continue to receive 
modest tees for permission lo copy 
their works which before the suit some 
copyshops simply copied illegally and 
sold lor a profii,' 

Nicholas A. Veliotes, president of the 
Association ol American Publishers, 
characterized the agreement as 'good 
news — lor copyright, for publishing and 
for Ihe educational cdmmunity." 

Veliotes said, "Copyright encourages 
creativity by ensuring that authors and 
publishers are compensated lor their 
original works, h is lilting and appropri- 
ate Ihat copyright be respected within 
Ihe context of higher education, which 
Itself makes such a dynamic contribu- 
Ibn to this intellectual creativity. This 
agreement is a positive instrument in 
fostering Ihat respect." 



Lady 'Dons basketball team looks forward to winning season 



By Mark Donaldson 
Sports Editor 

Trust, conditioning and a measure of 
patience are the ingredients that will 
boost the IPFW women's basketball 
program to the next level ol success. 
First-year head coadi Eileen Klelnlelter 
hopes to mix these with a veteran team 
led by an Atl-American, an All-Slate 
newcomer and a pressure defense to 
concoct a bullet ol viclories. 

Klelnlelter Inherits 11 players Irom 
last season as well as one, Tina 



Menler, who played two seasons lor 
the Lady 'Dons from 19B8-90, In addi- 
tion, Ireshman Jamie LaRue brings All- 
State credentials and versatility to Ihe 
backcourt. 

Leading Ihe list of relurning letter win- 
ners Is senior forward Lisa Miller. Last 
season the Kodak All-AmerM::an led Ihe 
greal Lakes Valley Conlerenc© in scor- 
ing with 21 .4 points per game. She 
also ranked among the league leaders 
in rebounding, lleld-goal percentage, 
free-throw percentage and steals. 



Miller ended the 1990-91 campaign as 
Ihe IPFW career scoring leader with 
1,606 points. 

Klelnlelter feels Miller will continue to 
grow and Improve. 

*l believe people never reach their 
potenliat," she said In an interview on 
Friday 'so I'm k&gt;oklng for an increase in 
Ihe level of Lisa's play, 

"I'm not saying more points necessar- 
ily. I'm saying an increased aware- 
ness ol Ihe nuances ol the game, I'm 



saying more vocal leadership, Tm say- Two other starters reluming form last 

ing even better execution. These are season's team are senior forward 

things Ihal will add lo Lisa's personality Shelly Sands and junior center Pam 

In all areas ol her life," Edwards. 



Klelnteller hopes that by spreading 
around the scoring responsibility, 
opposing delenses will be unable to 
key on Miller. 

'Our Intent is for all live positions to 
be offensive threats. * she said. 'We 
won't need to solely rely on Lisa to 
score all of the time.' 



Sands, who averaged almost 10 
points a game last year, Is a three-time 
letter winner. The elementary educa- 
tion major from Hunllnglon will be 
looked to for leadership, defensive 
Intensity and increased scoring, 
according to Klelnfleter.

One of three senators 
deserves impeachment 

Dirty politics can be lun, They certainly are nol lun for the politician 
involved, but lor those who enjoy seeing people in power squirm-dirty 
politics are kind ot neat- 
Well, IPFW is getting a little lasle ol dirty politics from our friends in stu- 
dent govefnmeni, II seems that someone doesn't like Ihree senators: 
Sally Green, Mark Snyder and Nancy Barger, All ihree student senators 
have been charged with various rule violations, and all three face 
impeachmeni However, only one of Ihem deserves to be impeached. 
So where do dirty politics (all into this? The sludenl government internal 
affairs committee has found these senators in violation of njles, that's il, 
right? Wrong. There is much more to the story- 
First, the charges for senalors Green and Snyder seem to be tnjmped 
up. 

Look at the charge against Sally Green. She is being brought up on a 
direct violation of Ihe IPSGAconstitulion, Her violation? Green "failed to 
represent her constituency with responsibility and sympathetic action, lo 
wri; Senator Sally Green deslroyed a written request lor information from 
one sludent and stated 'he should gel a life' or words to that effect." 
There is a giant hole in the charge against Green. The person whom 
she toid to 'get a life" was a SAB member, a colleague of Green's nol a 
conslhuent. He wanted to know something about the actions of a com- 
mittee on which Green served, — —— - ■■i^^ .. — - 
Even if Green was rude to her col- Barger iS lying. If She 
league its not enough to be thought that the StU- 
impeachedfor The impeachment dent WaS jUSt kind Of 
proceedings against Green should ' . 

be disconiinued Creepy and scary, why 

All four charges against senator did She vehemently 
^ Mark Snyder should also be attack him? 

I', dropped immediately. Snyder has _^__^_^^_^^_^_^_^^,^ 
been charged with nominating an 

ex-officio member to the student affairs committee that he chairs. 
According to Snyder, this action was prompted by a suggestion from 
higher up in IPSGA. Snyder has also been charged with threatening a 
student, "li'ou belter watch your back," he allegedly said. In addition, 
Snyder has been charged with smoking in a non-srrxDking area, using the 
IPSGA computer lo write papers and notes, and using IPSGA stationery 
lor personal reasons. 

The charges against Snyder are ridiculous and should be dropped. The 
senate is obviously just using these petty violations to gel rid of Snyder. 
The sad Ihing is they had the pertect opportunity and reason to impeach 
him last year and Ihe senate wasnl able to puli it off. The new charges 
are a pathetic attempt to remedy a situation which has gotten way out of 
control. 

Here the slory changes a little. The third senator, Nancy Barger, should 
be impeached. Her charge of "making a false accusation ot misconduct 
against a sludent" is a very serious one, 
Barger made these charges against a sludent lo keep him out of slu- 
denl senate. She relied on second-hand information in claiming that Ihe 
student, and senate hopeful, had frightened and even attacked women at 
IPFW, 
Barger even look this a step further by attempling lo broadcast these 
charges In a letter to the editor in The Communicator, Barger also told 
memberg ol The Communicator staff that she was sure that the sludent in 
question had Irighlened and attacked women. 

When Ihe paper asked her lor verification ot these claims she said thai 
she knew of women on campus who would talk aboul Ihe situation. No 
sludenl ever came fonAiard to back up Barger's claims. 

By shouting around campus that this IPFW sludenl was a danger to 
women. Barger was hurting an apparently innocent sludenl through her 
position as a senator. She used this second-hand inlormalion against ihe 
sludenl to keep him from student senate. She delamed and slandered 
the sludent. All ol this was done as Nancy Barger. student senator. 

Barger could be hil wilh a law suit by the student. She could be 
charged with slander. And il is quite possible that the sludenl is able lo 
bring this suit against Barger and student government- There is money in 
student government lo be had. And by making false accusalions of crimi- 
nal aciivily against this sludenl, Barger Is putting Ihe IPFW students' 
money in danger. Slander is serious stull, 

Now Barger is changing her tune. She told The Communicator lasl 
Tuesday thai she never claimed that the sludent "attacked women" just 
that he "scared" them. Barger is lying. II she thought that the sludent 
was jusl kind of creepy and scary, why did she vehemently attack him, 
making sure he didn't gel into student senale? 

Before her change of heart, Barger told The Communicator she had 
"counseled several female students" who told her Ihat they were fright- 
ened and attacked by the studeni in question. 

Even though Barger says now that she believes the studeni did not 
attack women, the fad remains thai she accused him of the crime at one 
point. The fact remains that she, as a sludent senator, maliciously slan- 
dered a tellow sludenl and constituent. For this. Barger should be 
impeached, 

IPFW sludenls dom deserve this kind of Ireatment from a senator who 
Is in a position to serve our needs. And we certainly don't deserve to 
have our studeni activity money pay for a slander settlement. The ettort 
to Irr^each Barger must be focused, intensive and successful. 




Lehers to The Editor 



Education must stick with proven methods 



To the Editor: 

1 find your editorial on Ihe educational 
syslem in this counlry to be unaccepl- 
ably narrow. 

To be quite frank, who the hell cares 
what Ian Holland and his 1.4 million 
dollar a year salary has to say about 
education. The fact thai he runs his 
insurance-mafia in Fort Wayne in no 
way gives him qualification lo direct the 
learning process ol our children. It you 
had researched your ideas more care- 
luliy, you would have discovered that 
the flunkies that are being turned out ol 
our Fort Wayne Community Schools 
are Ihe direct result ol his meddling 
over the past several years. 

If you believe that GPAs are Ihe sole 
guidelines ol educational ranking. I am 



Ihe Easter Qunny. Are you aware ttiat 
a student can now receive straight F's 
on their report cards and still be 
passed onto Ihe next grade. Of course 
not. A teacher, or for that mattef, an 
entire school system cannot refuse 
passing such a sludenl it the parent(s) 
object. And the iniroduction ol ISTEP 
testing only Inflates the size of this 
problem. One of my closest friends 
has experienced this very thing in his 
years ot leaching. 

Let us not get into Ihe njt of arguing 
about teaching methods, that only 
makes matters worse. Remember the 
"new math" ol the late 60s and early 
70s. I do very welt. I would lake my 
assignments home and ask for help 
Irom my father, who is educated well 
beyond a singular doctorate level, and 



the concepts of free thinking were lost 
lo Ihe wind. Now we see this back- 
ward idea of teaching math without 
numbers in the lower grades. Folks, it 
t^as always been my understanding 
Ihat before you could understand what 
was in a book, you had to learn how lo 
read. 

Didn'1 any of you go to Sunday 
school? The lirst thing you did was to 
memorize Bibia verses, then you could 
begin to learn what the content actually 
meant. It is no ditterent with history, 
math, English, or even athletics- You 
are taught the basic ideas and guide- 
lines, then you hone your skills by lut- 
ther study. 

And one last point lo ponder. 11 edu- 
cation is filled with such awful short- 



comings in America, why is it that we 
have the largest percentage ol high 
school graduates in the entire world, go 
on lo seek further education? And why 
is it that Ihe majority ol Noble Laure- 
ates in the lieUs ol science are made 
in America. If we stop complaining 
about how tough school is, and no 
longer lower academic standards to 
reflect success al all levels of pre-unt- 
versily education, and refuse to hop on 
every "new leaching method' band- 
wagon that comes along, and lastly, 
keep to the lired and proven methods 
that have been used in the parochial 
schools for over fifty years, then just 
might be able lo pul Ihe horse back in 
fronl of the cart. 

Steven C. Trier 
IPFW Sludent 



Student disagrees with last week's editorial 



To the EdHor: 

I was tx)th surprised and Insulted by 
the lack of insight In last week's editori- 
al tilled 'Admissions requirements 
need to be updated.' The editorial 
speculated that IPFW has a bad repu- 
tatkin because anyone can gel in and 
that the admissions requirements need 
to be slillened. . As someone who has 
attended both IPFW and Indiana Uni- 
versity. Btoomington, I disagree strong- 
ly with the editorial. 

II IPFW does have a bad reputation, it 
generally stems from people who have 
never attended here and know not of 
what they speak. I also believe that 
the bad reputalion is a function of 
IPFW's lack of social standing. In 
short, it is not as 'cool' to go to school 
here as it is to attend in Bloomington or 
West Lafayette. 

As lo Ihe allegation that IPFW will let 
anyone in, I again believe ihal the edi- 
torial was very inaccurate. While IPFW 



may not be comparable to Notre Dame 
or Northwestern, the standards here 
are very much like those at other Indi- 
ana state universities. Indeed, mosi 
schools oiler admission to students on 
a probationary basis. 

One important thing that Ihe editorial 
tell out is Ihat ri students do poorly dur- 
ing their probationary period or in Ihe 
Guided Studies program, they are not 
allowed to continue taking classes. 1 
do not see these programs as a mark 
on university but as a sign that the uni- 
versity recognizes that sometimes stu- 
dents achieve at different levels during 
their academic careers. For example, I 
have known many sludenls who, have 
done poorly in high school and have 
done well In college (and vice versa). 
Shouldn't these individuals be given 
the chance lo prove Ihemselves? I 
think that Ihey can adequately prove or 
disprove themselves in their first 
semester in college without requiring 
that they go through an excessive pro- 



cess ol writing an essay and appearing 
before a board to prove their dedica- 
tion. Usually the turmoil of the admis- 
sions process and signing up for class- 
es nseH is enough to prove that a stu- 
dent really wants to altend college. 
Once students are admitted, we have 
many different levels of classes lo help 
separate students al different knowl- 
edge levels. In addition, students can- 
not take a level ol math or English 
above what they test into through the 
placement tests. Even il all students In 
a class are not equally gifted, is the 
author ol the editorial above taking 
classes with the mainstream lor a few 
semesters? 

Surprisingly enough. I did agree with 
one thing in the editorial. Students do 
"consider IPFW as a safeguard." I, 
however, dont feel Ihat this is in case 
"they can't get into any olher colleges.' 
but rather, in case they are not fortu- 
nate enough to alford going to college 
elsewhere. The author ol Ihe editorial 



harbors one major misconception 
about students on main campuses 
which should be dispelled. Just 
because students or their parents have 
enough money so that they can attend 
a large main campus doesnT mean that 
they are looking for an 'intellectually 
stimulating and challenging education.' 
In my experience, I met many parenl- 
llnanced casual students at Blooming- 
Ion who were a sharp contrast lo many 
of the self-supponed serious students I 
know here at IPFW. 

t believe that IPFW is a lirst-rale state 
university. There are problems hero, 
as there are on any campus. It Is hard 
lo believe thai Ihe author ol the editori- 
al is so totally unaware ol one of 
IPFWs greatest successes. That suc- 
cess in nol indiscriminantly providing 
education to any student, but rather, 
providing affordable education lo local 
students. 

Jennifer Nlater 
IPFW Studeni 



Embattled senators write in self-defense 



To the Editor: 

The Indiana-Purdue Studeni Govern- 
ment Association has, yet again, 
shown itself to be incapable or unwill- 
ing to act as a credible or viable repre- 
sentative voice of tfiB student popula- 
tion at IPFW. 

Today, as we write this teller, we 
three seantors are facing impeachment 
with other senators being threatened. 
We represent three ol the live original 
senate members and two senators out 
ol the live remaining whom the student 
body elected lo ollice. Ot the twenty 
members of Ihe senate — your suppos- 
edly elected representatives— only 
three elected senalors remain, thus far! 

Likewise, Ihe officers ol student gov- 
ernment are not those who you elected 
to office. Of the lour executive officers, 
only Iwo hold Ihe offices to which you 
elected them. Your elected sludenl 
body president resigned in July rather 
than lace impeachemenl and Ihe indi- 



vidual now occupying the office of vice 
president was elected lo that position 
by the senate. 

Who or what is the insidious element 
so inlecttng your sludent government 
as to destroy it? There Is not a single 
factor. The individual responsible tor 
Ihe failed impeachment attempt last 
year against your sludent body presi- 
dent, Mark S. Snyder, is, of course, the 
same individual who succeeded to the 
office ol student body president this 
year after succeeding to bring about 
the impeachment ol this year's student 
body president. Now, it is this same 
Individual who Is a factor In Ihe current 
impeachemenl ol Mark S. Snyder 
(againi), Nancy Barger and Sally 
Gieen But is it simply the Intrigue ol 
this power-hungry and insecure neo- 
Machiavelian who Is to blame? Cer- 
tainly this individual Is a lactor bul jusl 
as certainly nol Ihe only one. 

Racism, sexism and ageism have 



been suggested as possible factors. Is 
il discrimination and prejudice which is 
the pernicious virus plaguing your gov- 
ernment? Yes, we have each experi- 
enced discrimination and prejudice at 
Ihe hands of sludenl government and 
have seen other past members tall vic- 
tim to overt and covert racism but, 
again, this is not Ihe only factor 
involved. 

I would suggest that If there may be a 
single destructive element which has 
invaded your government 11 is one 
called seH-aggrandizement. You see, 
it is not enough that these three sena- 
tors had initiated a clothing drive lor 
needy children or wore working on a 
'victim's assistance program* lor stu- 
dents at this campus. It is ol no matter 
that we had brought you picnic tables, 
clocks in the cafeteria, or a student 
information center, tt Is ot no impor- 
tance that we were working on 
exlenoded building hours lor Walb 



Union, a legal-aid service lor students, 
and condom availability on campus. 
Our many, many hours spent in expos- 
ing the asbestos hazard on campus in 
order that we might safeguard Ihe 
health ol ihe students we serve. 
accounts for nothing. 

All ol this nol wilhsianding. we tailed. 
We tailed to place our personal reputa- 
tions and personal reward above our 
responsibiliiy to Ihe students we were 
elected to serve. Wo, loollshly il would 
seem, look our positions in student 
government to be something more Ihan 
a means to improve our resumes. We 
believed that our duty to our lellow stu- 
dents superseded future recommenda- 
tions from university administrators Of 
nominalons to boards of trustees- 

As a result we somelimes 'stepped 
on loes' by speaking out on or addres-

Watch your backs, capitalist weasels 



By Jim Walker 
Managing Editor 

In case you dfdm nolice ihe new logo, 
Ih9 liltle column here has changed to 
an entirely new o^emise. No longer will 
Ihls Ihing be a weightless waste ol 
newsprint. No longer will this column 
childishly refer to women as "babes." 
Ohhh no, this isalloverl 

Inslead, we've turned to more serious 
mailers, namely pulling a stop lo Ihe 
bloody QKploilalion of you. the con- 
sumers, by capitalist weasels. This col- 
umn, now called Consumer Watchdog, 
is here (or YOU, Have you been 
burned by an evasive mail-order com- 
pany? Have you been rooked by a 
shilly used-car salesman? Have you 
been forced lo pose nude lor an 
amoral camera buff relative who later 
sold Ihe piciufes for a handsome pfof- 
il? Well. Consumer Watchdog is al 
your service. We are your Legion ol 
Justice. 

II you are in trouble, call or write Ihe 
equalizers al the t^nsumer Watchdog 
office complex located here on cam- 
pus. The address will be brought lo you 
laler in the show, so stay tuned. 

Let's gel righl to ihe business at hand. 
Consumer Watchdog received a letter 
from an IPFW student recently that 
brought to light some shady practices 
by a local hobby shop. 

Thanks lor your letter Greg, We found 
your case very interesting, so interesl- 
ing thai we turned the Consumer 
Watchdogs loose and investigated. I 
called Phil's to see what Ihe deal was, 



after all that is my job as Jim Walker, 
Consumer Watchdog, 

When I first reached Phil's, I spoke 
with a sales boy. Here is a transcriptbn 
ol our conversation. The sales boy is 
designated with S.B. I am designated 
as W.D, 

S.B. :Uh. Helto. 

W.D. : Is this Phil's Hobby Shop? 

SB. : Yes, can I help you? 

Well, that's enough of that. Anyway, I 
went on to ask Ihe sales boy about Ihe 
discouni package for IPFW students. 
He told me a couple of different ver- 
sions: 1. It is 20 percent off all items 
purchased lor school. 2, No, I mean it's 
10 percent off all items not mar1&lt;ed with 
a red sale tag. 

So I thanked the boy and then double 
checked with the Student Discount 
Package brochure. Sure enough. Greg 
Willson was right, there was supposed 
lo be 20 percent oil all regularly priced 
items. 

Being Ihe Consumer Watchdog I am, 
I deftly dialed Phil's again. This time 1 
wasn't screwing around, I asked to 
speak to Phil personally. The sales boy 
directed me inslead to the manager, ft 
wasn't Phil, but il was a manager. She 
informed me that the discouni was 10 
percent off the retail price ol regularly 
tagged items and that's how it always 
had been. She said that the student's 
government had messed up when pro- 
ducing the brochure. Shocking, huh? 
She told Consumer Watchdog that she 
called the student government olfice 
and informed them ol the error. Nalu- 



Student questions discount 



An open letter to Phil's Hobby Shop 
and the publisher ol the 1991 Student 
Discount package: 

I would li&gt;&lt;e to ash a simple question. 
What kind of scam are you running? 
The discount package slates that Phil's 
Hobby Shop oflers a 20 percent dis- 
count to IPFW ID holders. I have an ID, 
Where's my discouni? I went in to pur- 
chase a radio for my remote control 
airplane. They were selling it for 
approximately $180 (they didnt have it 
in stock at the time). When I inquire as 
lo my "discouni," I was told that the dis- 
count, if 1 choose to use it, woukJ be 
applied to the suggested retail price 
which was approximately S35DI The 
discount would make it S280. I read the 
brochure and il slates, and I quote, "20 
percent off regular priced items." not 
retail priced items. 

What's Ihe deal? II I buy it as an 
IPFW student, il cosls S280. Where 
does the difference go? II Ihe publish- 
ers ol the discount package can do no 
better than this lo gel students a deal, 
then please save your energy and slop 
wasting our money, I think it is time 
thai the publisher did a serious re-eval- 
uation 01 the 'discounts' offered in this 
brochure. I would like lo know how

rally, Ihe shrews in student government 
have done nothing to fix this gool. 

Bui what about Ihe beef Greg Willson 
has with the remote control device 
deal? The Phil's manager lold me that 
they can't oHer a discount on the big 
dollar items like the remote control 
because these items are sold loo 
closely lo cost. According to the man- 
ager, the big dollar items are always 
merited with a red sale lag. She went 
on to add thai a lot of cool stulf like 
hobby magazines, model cement and 
balsa wood were still purchasable with 
the discouni. 

So il seems that all of this trouble was 
caused by a printing error and a Utile 
miscommunication, 1 doesm seem that 
Phil's actually intended lo deceive the 
consumer, but the stipulations behind 
the use of discouni are kind of tricky. 
All of this is kind of disappointing to Ihe 
Consumer Watchdog because I really 
wanted lo kick some ass here. 

At this point in the column the Con- 
sumer Watchdog is supposed to come 
to a verdict on Ihe capitalist weasel in 

auestion. Consumer Watchdog Ver- 
ict: Guilty of Stupidity, Phil's is guilty 
for trusting the student government to 
1, Print the discount correctly and 2, 
Fix the error. The student government 
shrews are equally il not more guilty 
just because they are a bunch of lunk 
heads. 

So, as Greg Willson suggested in his 
letter, it may be the best idea Id shop 
elsewhere lor your hobby needs. I 
know that the next time I need balsa 
wood, I'm going to Hobbyland, 

Next week in Consumer Watchdog 
we will look at the rest of Ihe business- 
es offering discounis in the Student 
Discount Package and see il these 
places do better deals. Oh, here is the

5ing issues which this University would 
have rather kept hidden. We often 
limes relused lo "make nice" with those 
in student government who would 
remain silent and apathetic to students' 
needs and student rights violations 
ralher than expose themselves to the 
dislavor o( Ihe University. We often 
took actions or made statements which 
could potentially embroil students gov- 
ernment in controversy and Ihus upset 
Ihe social atmosphere which many stu- 
dent government members desired. 
When we saw racism rear its ugly head 
we yelled "racist," When we saw stu- 
dents being oppressed by gander we 
yelled "sexist," When we saw students' 
rights being violated because ol their 
5e)(ual orientation or any other manner 
of discrimination we cried *foul," To do 
less seemed to us to call into question 
our elected position of advocacy and 
leadership 

Were we always right? No, No one is 
right all of the time. However, when we 
were in error it was not out of selfish 
attempts at self-aggrandizement but 
out of our attempts to right what we 
saw to be wrongs. Yes, we made mis- 
takes. We are guilty ol allempling lo 
involve a greater number ol students in 
their elected government. We may 
have even been guilty of misusing a 
sheet of stationery or smoking a 
cigarette in a non-smoking area. We 
may have been less than responsive to 
letters ol sexual harassment from fel- 
low student government members and 
to certain members of the student txidy 
who have a reputation ol intimidating 
women on campus. Wo may be guilty 
of those "mistakes," but the mistakes 
were not self-serving and were, it 
indeed mistakes, not made lo Ihe detri- 
ment ol the sludenl body at IPFW. 

Now, you may be thinking that this 



very letter is no more than an act ol 
self-aggrandizemenl on our part H so, 
I suggest that you trade places with us 
and experience Ihe "pleasures" of 
being ridiculed by faculty, staff and 
administrators. Thai you enjoy the thrill 
of having your life explored on the 
pages of The Communk:ator on a near 
weekly basis. That you have your fam- 
ily intimidated by "student investiga- 
tors," You have your emptoyers con- 
tacted by these student police invesli- 
galifig your honesty and credibility. 
You have your credibility, honesty and 
trustworthiness called into question on 
and off campus by employers, friends 
and faculty members. No, you would 
probably not fmd our shoos a very 
comlortable lit. You would probably 
remain content to sit kJfy by complain- 
ing about things you do not like and 
then chastising those who try lo 
address your complaints. 

Unless you are one ol those we have 
just described and simply content to sit 
in your classrooms and study the theo- 
ries of democracy, sociology, psycholo- 
gy or philosophy, then I would suggest 
that you join us in screaming "We're 
tired as hell of this, and we're not going 
to lake anymorel" We are ol a belief 
that the Indiana-Purdue Student Gov- 
ernment Association has proven itself 
corrupt, uncredible, and aniilhetical to 
the democratic principles il espouses. 
As a result it is no longer able to exer- 
cise the trust of the students it repre- 
sents and is incapable of tteing entrust- 
ed with the 5250,000 ol students' 
monies which it controls 



immediately so that you may "throw the 
bums out" or, it the student government 
refuses lo agree, thai this University 
removes hs recognition and sponsor- 
ship ol this government as the oHicial

Four Fort Wayne arts groups to take a new downtown home 



By Kelll E. Boerv 
Copy Editor 

How much can a building benetJI its 
new tenants? Ouhe a bil If you ask the 
lour new occupants ol 437 East Berry 
Sireel. ARCH, Fort Wayne Dance Col- 
lective, Fori Wayne Cinema Center and 
Aniink moved Irom their indcvidual sites 
to Iheif new location at 437 E. Berry 
St.. called 437 East Berry Street. 

The main advantage lo these groups 
occupying one building Is tliat they can 
join forces in their respective perfor- 
mances and presentations. Geoff 
Cepfiarl, the executive director of Fori 
Wayne Cinema Center said, "Working 
together was always dilllcult because 
all of us are very busy. We had lo 
make special ellods to get together 
and talk about the potential tor cooper- 
ative programming." 

Some shuffling of schedules has 
already occurred (or Arllink. a non-prof- 
it visual arts gallery. According to 
Shirley Champion, managing director 
ol Aniink along with Betty Fishman, the 
artistic director, the gailery is now open 
Thursday through Sunday when Cine- 
ma Center is showing movies so peo- 
ple can view the art before the film 
begins. 



ARCH is an organiialkjn (or the his- 
toric preservation of buiWings In Allen 
County. According lo Janet Nahrwold, 
the executive director ol ARCH, one of 
the main principles ol the organization 
is to 'educate the publk: of the value ol 
historic preservation." 

ARCH irtcorporates mar^y education- 
al programs. Nahrwold stated that 
many students use the files on historic 
buildings for research papers. The 
organization has designed a badge for 
Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts that the 
scouts can receive alter meeting cer- 
tain qualifications. Nahrwold said that 
ARCH wants to "make students more 
aware of different aspects ol architec- 
ture. ..They go out and see If they can 
lind them (examples) in their own 
neighborhoods." 

Fort Wayne Dance Collective is a 
teaching and Independent movement 
arls organization. According to Lisa 
Tsetse, Dance Collective was founded 
in 1979 and the current 10 staK mem- 
bers teach classes tor people age two 
to age 82. 

Classes include creative movement 
tor toddlers, modern dance for children, 
adult Illness, adult ballet. Intermediate 
jazz and classes lor aduh senior citi- 



zens. Dance Collective also has class- 
es outside ol Its studios, including 
classes taught at hospitals. 

The organization's concert season 
runs from January lo June and it will 
offer 30 classes a week in addrtkin to 
performances during the season. 

Tsetse stated, "The new space pro- 
vides us with a beautiful facility which 
people appreciate up front. Physical 
space Is really Imporlant for dance. 
The floors are very wonderlully 
designed for a variety of dance class- 
es. There is a floor finished with a 
wonderful oil finish which is very solt 
and gentle to the feet and allows the 
barefoot dancer to move across the 
floor with ease. The other floor is more 
of a durable finish. It will be used for 
everything from tap to fitness to ball- 
room dancing classes and jazz." 

Tsetse enjoys the building lor another 
reason: its atmosphere. "It has a feel- 
ing ol an older renovated building 
which brings a lot ol tradition," said 
Tsetse. "The exposed brick walls that 
are left In the studios make lor wonder- 
ful aesthetics. It's a good space. It 
makes you feel like you're in a second- 
story studio, a downtown city studio, 
whh lots of light, the windows providing

Women's basketball team poised for new season 



Continued from page 1 

'Shelly is one o( Ihe captains of the 
team," stie said. "We want her to 
tal&lt;e advantage of the larger, more 
Immobile defensive layers. We'll be 
looking for her to use more sho! 
fakes and fier speed to gel her 
points.' 

At 5-feet-n-inches Edwards will 
often face taller post players, but by 
averaging seven rebounds and over 
nine points a game last season, she 
has proved herself capable. She 
also ranked among GLVC leadere in 
field-goal percenlage. 

"Pam can handle herself in the 
paint," said Kleinfeller. "She is 
strong and experienced- When she 
gels Ihe ball inside, we want her !o 
take a single power dribble and go to 
the hole.' 

A pair of sophomores, who com- 
bined to average eight points and six 
rebounds a game, return to round 
out the posl position, Kleinfelter not- 
ed that 6-fool Michelle Conley has 
shown improved shooting range and 
touch and that 5-toot-n-inch Kim 
Hecker should be a stalwart 
rebounder and defensive player. 

Two other fronlcourt players from 
last year's six-member freshman 
class are back. 

Dawn Dressier, who started over 
half of iPFW's games last season 
and led all freshman with a 4.9- 
points-per-game average, will team 
with Ann Lueken to provide depth 
and versatility up from for the Lady 
'Dons, 

In Friday's interview Kleinleller 
spokehighly of thepair. 

'Dawn is a heady player who 
makes good decisions," she said, "I 
don't lind myself correcting her in 
practice. As an added bonus, this 
past week she has really gotten on it 
on defense. 

"Annie Lueken. as of right now, has 
contributed more as a small for- 
ward than in any other position," 
Kleinfelter continued "She con- 
verts Ihe backside rebounds, and if 
our post players are tied up, she 
sneaks in to get open on the of! 
side." 

The backcourt will play an impor- 
tant role in IPFW's up-tempo 
offense, according to Kleinfeller. 

"We want to keep the fast pace 
from previous seasons," she said. 
*but we need to cut down on our 
tumovers and make better decisions 
on our primary and secondary 
breaks.' 

Memer, a junior from DeKalb High 
School, was not on the Lady 'Dons 
roster last season after having 
played for two seasons. She will tw 
one of several players who will 
attempt to fill the void left when the 
school's career-assist leader. Dawn 
Harbaugh. completed her eligibility 
last season. 

Senior Melissa Shipp returns as the 
Lady 'Don's most prolific three-point 
shooter from a year ago, having hit 
12 of 49 attempts. Shipp, who trans- 
ferred from Delta Community Col- 
lege, laces an increased role in her 
second season at IPFW. 

"Not only are we looking lor Missy 
to help us make the perimeter 
threat a part of our normal offense, 
but we want to add to her game," 
said Kleinfelter. 'She can mix it up 
inside. She can take the ball to the 
hole. People may not realize it, but 
she is our strongest player in the 
weight room." 

According to Kleinfelter, Amy 
Perkins, a 5-[oot-7-inch sophomore 
from Frankfort, will vie lor playing

time al the point-guard spot. 

"Amy has good skills," she said. 
"She sees the court very well and is 
a good penetrator. I like the way she 
has been scrappy on defense and 
has the speed to get in the passing 
lanes." 

The list of returnees is completed 
by 5-foot-lO-inch junior Amy 
Hogan and 5-(oot-7-inch sopho- 
more Kelli Underwood. Kleinfelter 
feels the two players, both of whom 
played sparingly last season, will 
add depth to the squad. 

The sole freshman on this year's 
team is LaRue, a 5-foot-7-inch guard 
from Fremont. She was named to 
the Indiana High School All-Slate 
team as an honorable mention m her 
junior year and advanced to the All- 
Slate third team after her senior 
year. LaRue also averaged 2i .5 
points, 8.8 rebounds, 6.2 assists and 
live steals a game last year for 15-7 
Fremont High School. 

Kleinfelter likes what she sees in 
the freshman. 

"Jamie not only brings impressive 
credentials from high school," she 
said, "but she has proven herself in 
both of our inlrasquad games. She 
is one of the most coachable kids 
I've ever had, and she always has a 
good attitude.* 

Kleinlelter steps in to head a pro- 
gram powered by the momentum of 
winning 17, 22 and 19 games the 
last three seasons, including qualify- 
ing for the NCAA tournament in 
1990. In spite of the success, the 
Lady 'Dons have never placed high- 
er than third in Ihe perennially tough 
GLVC. 

Friday, Kleinfelter discussed the 
team and the plan to help guide it lo 
the next level of success. 

"We, both players and coaches, 
need to be patient as we team an 
enbrely new system," she said. 'We 
have some habits lo break, so many 
things to learn. 

"This team is more team-oriented 
than any I've worked with," contin- 
ued Kleinfelter. "The kids have a 
great deal of pride and are receptive 
lo what I want them to do. I've been 
impressed with the fact that all our 
kids are very good students of the 
game. They are extremely coach- 
able and show a real desire lo 
learn," 

Kleinfelter has adopted several 
methods to help the Lady 'Dons build 
on their solid foundation. 

One of the most innovative was a 
weekend retreat the team spent 
recently at Project Cope near Pleas- 
ant Lake. ind. Cope is a acronym tor 
ChaJlenging Outdoor Personal Expe- 
rience. The program, conducted in a 
natural setting, is designed to 
increase trust, self-esteem, team- 



work, communication and problem- 
solving within a group. 

"We reler back lo many things we 
experienced that weekend," said 
Kleinfelter. "things like trusting your 
teammates and yourself. 

"We discovered ways of attacking 
our fears and approaching chal- 
lenges with determination and 
aggressiveness, to confront deci- 
sions actively, with a feistiness." 

An extended conditioning program 
IS another facet that Kleinfelter 
hopes will enhance the Lady 'Don's 
performance this season. 

"We really feel our weight program 
will pay dividends," she said. "We 
came in early in September and it's 



something we've stuck with. Some 
of our big girls have increased 30 or 
40 pounds on the bench. 

"We switched to an endurance pro- 
gram after we began practice. I 
think the girls have seen the benefits 
of the program." 

So, how does this year's version of 
the Lady 'Dons compare to last's? 
The firsl-year coach has lew refer- 
ence points. 

"Althougti I've watched many 
tapes of last season's team, I'm not 
really in a position to compare," 
said Kleinfelter, *We haven't played 
anybody so it's difficult to assess 
where we stand right now. We've 
concentrated on many areas ol

Mastodons hope experience pays 



By Jim Helm 
Slalf Writer 

LasI year was a learning experience 
lor the IPFW men's basketball team 
thai finished the season wHh a disap- 
pointing 16-12 record. But II the last 
month ol the season was any Indica- 
tion, the team learned Its lessons well. 

'We were 10-10 at one point," said 
IPFW coach Andy Piazza, "but we fin- 
ished 6-2 down the slretch. In Febru- 
ary we were good as any learn In the 
GLVC- 

WHb only one senior, rt was a young 
and inexperienced team that Piazza 
put on the floor. Inexperience wont be 
a problem lor the 'Dons this season as 
Piazza tias lour of live starters back. 

'We have as much experience as 
we've eve' had here," said Piazza. 
"We're two deep at every posiibn right 
now and some people play a comblna- 
lion of positions, wlilch allows us to go 
three deep.' 

Sophomore Jelf Smithey will return 
as point guard to run the offense for 
Piazza, Guards Duane Shears and 
Clarence Hich will play the wings and 
provide the outside scoring with 6-too1- 
7-inch Sean Gibson and 6-loot-B-lnch 
Doug fleinke at the posts doing the 
dirty work instde the paint. 

Piazza has three newcomers to this 
year's team. Shane Gibson (Sean's 
brother), a 6-fool-5-inch forward, 
played al Baptist University in 
Charle'^tnn, S C , iwo years ago and 



was at Purdue University last year as a 
student. Mark Allen transferred lo 
IPFW from Cincinnati Tech. Al 6-fe8l- 
S-lnches, he will see work al both 
guard and forward. 

"Mark has good Inside moves, yet 
possesses a good outstde shot.' said 
Piazza. 

Andre Walton is a 5-foot-8-inch guard 
who transferred to IPFW from Delta Jr 
College. Walton Is quick and should 
sirenghten IPFW's backcourt. The 
amount of playing lime these three gel 
will depend on how soon they make 
the adjustment to Piazza's system. 

Wrth four seniors and eight juniors on 
this year's squad, leadership is one 
area Piazza doesn't have lo worry 
about. 

'They basically lake care of them- 
selves,' said Piazza. But should the 
occasion arise. Clarence Rich and 
Sean Gibson will be Ihere lo encour- 
age the younger people or rf someone 
is hanging their head, see that they 
doni hang it too low." 

Offensively, took for the 'Dons lo be 
an up-tempo team. 

"We're going to run every chance we 
have,* said Piazza. "The better job we 
do of defensive rebounding. Ihe better 
we'll be able to run. We trap and press 
a lol and creSte a (ot of turnovers, so 
we run oil transition and defensive 
turnover." 

Last season IPFW led the league in
