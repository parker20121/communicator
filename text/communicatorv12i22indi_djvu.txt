Traffic incident spurs protest 



Student files harrassment charges

By 

Editor-in-chief 
As the result of an incident Wed- 
nesday, Feb. 25, IPFW student Jane 

Bartholomy has lodged a complaint of 
harrassment against campus police 
sergeant Larry Gaff. 

The elementary education student 
claims that Gaff harrassed her 
mentally and verbally because she 
gestured obscenely to the officer, 

Bartholomy was charged with 
disregarding a stop sign and resisting 
arrest in the incident by Fort Wayne 
city police officers Rick Bodeker and 
William Wismer, who Gaff had called 
; in to assist him. She was taken 
downtown by the officers, booked on 
the charges and released on her own 
recognizance. A March 19 court date 
has been set for a hearing on the 
charges. 

Maurice Shady, chief of the campus 
police, said last week that "at this 
point in time, we're fully supporting 
our officer. According to his report, he 
was properly executing his duties. " 

Shady said he would not comment on 
the details of the incident because of 
possible legal action in the case. 

Bartholomy told The Communicator 



thai (he incident began around 5:50 
p.m. as she was leaving the campus 
after her 4: 30 math class. 

She said that she was headed west on 
the campus drive in front of Kettler 
Hall and was in a line of traffic stopped 
for the stop sign when an officer in a 
patrol car came toward her in the 
eastbound lane — the some officer who 
had issued a parking ticket to her 
earlier that day, although she said she 
was unaware it was Ihe same officer. 

Bartholomy said that she had 
received a parking ticket while in 
class, and when she saw the officer, 
she thought, "all they have to do is 
drive around giving people like me 
tickets. " 

As the officer approached she 
"flipped him Ihe bird" (gave him an 
obscene gesture), she said. Theofficer 
then turned around in the circle drive 
in front of Kettler, pulled up beside her 
blocking oncoming traffic, and 
motioned her to pull over. 

Bartholomy said she motioned to the 
officer that she would pull over after 
she had cleared the intersection. 

She stopped her car on the median 
after crossing the Coliseum Boulevard 
intersection, and Galf pulled up behind 



her. Gaff approached her car and 
asked to see her driver's license and 
registration. Bartholomy said the 
officer returned to his car to "run a 
check on" her vehicle. 

After what Bartholomy said was 10 to 
15 minutes, she approached the police 
car to see what was taking so long. Gaff 
told her he was citing her for running a 
stop sign. 

At that point, Bartholomy said she 
said, "You' ve got to be kidding. I never 
ran any stop sign." Gaff continued to 
write and Bartholomy returned to her 
car. 

Gaff then approached her car and 
lold her lo sign the citation Bar- 
tholomy refused saying, "You know I 
never ran that stop sign. You were 
directly behind me— I'd be a fool if I 
had, "she said. 

Gaff had not explained to Bar- 
tholomy that signing the ticket was not 
an admission of guilt, she said, and she 
did not know differently. 

The officer then told her she was 
under arrest but didn't tell her what 
the charge was, Bartholomy said. He 
called in the city police to have her 
taken downtown to be booked, and he 
said that her car would be towed away. 



Student senate deals 
with financial issues 

Senators pass activity fee hike 



By JIM CHAPMAN 
Chief Reporter 

A resolution to raise the activity 
(ee to $20 and an amended amend- 
ment to schedule the Student 
Senate meetings every week unless 
no conditions exist to hold them were 
passed at a very short and unusual 
Student Senate meeting Feb. 23. 

At the start of the meeting, only 
seven members, one short of a 
needed quorum, showed up for the 
meeting. Absenteeism had already 
cancelled three Senate meetings this 

Senate President Steve Westrick, 
after talking to Dean of Students 
John Ulmer and Athletic Director 
Dave Skelton, decided to carry on 
the meeting unless someone 
protested the non-quorum. No one 
did. 

The non-quorum was forgotten 
near the end of the meeting when 
Senator Will Wise showed up. His 
vote was counted in the various acts 
of business. 

At the last Student Senate 
meeting, a fee committee came up 
with a resolution to raise the activity 
fee to $20. 

After a closed session in which the 
resolution was passed, Ann Momper 
protested the closing of the session 



to various non-voting members and 
guests, and the proposed hike was 
then repealed. The Senators voted to 
table the resolution until the Feb. 26 
meeting. 

After a week of decision making, 
Ihe Senators passed the fee hike. The 
resolution was slightly revised from 
the original proposal (see related 
story). 

An amendment was also voted on. 

Three weeks ago Ellen Engleman 
proposed an amendment to hold the 
Student Senate meetings on a bi- 
weekly basis. A lack of weekly 
business and time to complete 
committee work was cited as 
justification for the proposal. The 
amendment had not been voted on 
because of certain technicalities. 

At the Feb. 28 meeting, 
Engleman's amendment had finally 
passed all of the technical 
requirements and was ready for 
vote. 

After the amendment was read. 
Westrick requested that a vote on 
the amendment be extended again 
due to a lack of Senators present. 
Engleman displayed her outrage by 
claiming that the amendment had 
been laid over too long. 

Legislative Affairs Committee 
Chair Person Tom Harris, who 



disagreed with Engleman's 
amendment, then proposed a 
friendly amendment to Engleman's 
amendment. Harris wanted Senate 
meetings to be held every Wed- 
nesday unless there was no business 
at hand to attend to. If such a case 
existed, Westrick would inform the 
members on the previous Monday 
that the meetings would be can- 
celled. 

Engleman rejected Harris's 
revision lo her amendment A vote 
had to be taken on the amended 
amendment. The Senate voted to 
accept Harris's revision of 
Engleman's amendment. 

Engleman felt shafted because 
she felt that Harris's amendment 
did not have to go through the same, 
technical requirements that hers 
had to go through. Engleman also 
felt that Harris's amendment did not 
deserve to be called a friendly 
revision because it was completely 
different from hers. 

The final business at the meeting 
was the acceptance of the Music 
Therapy Club into the constitution. 
The purpose of the club is to provide 
new educational experiences to its 
members and to increase the 
awareness of the general public 
about music therapy.

The committee investigating the 

possibility of raising the activity fee 

has decided that it should be raised 



Fee hike aids activities, sports 



but Dave Leeka, director of Student 
Finance, said the split would not 
work because of accounting and 
book keeping purposes, said 
Engleman. 

The resolution calls for the per- 
centage to be reviewed annually by 
Ihe Student Senate Appropriations 
Committee. 

According to Ulmer and 
Engleman. the athlebc department 
has barely survived on one third of 
the funds of the current activity fee 
coming into them for the last couple 
of years. Engleman reported that 
Ihe athletic department is using old, 
worn out equipment that needs to be 
replaced. 

When the complelion of the HPER 
building is at hand, more money will 
be needed to pay people to manage 
Hie building according to Engleman. 
Engleman also said that these jobs 
will be offered to students. 

The Senate and Ulmer had in- 
vestigated the possibility o( IPFW 
having a graduated activity fee for 
part-time students as well as full- 
time students for the last two years. 

Under such a proposal, a higher 
number of classroom hours would 
mean a higher activity fee as well as 
a lower number of classroom hours 
resulting in a lower activity fee. 

However, Ulmer said that Purdue, 
West Lafayette opposes the part-

The Student Senate will be asking 



to $20. 

Now that the resolution has been 
voted on by the Senate, it will pass 
from John Ulmer, dean of Students' 
Services, onto Chancellor Giusti for 
approval. Final approval will be 
given at Purdue, West Lafayette. 

With the 520 activity fee in effect, 
the athletic department would be 
receiving approximately $40,000 per 
semester as compared to $22,000 
which is what they receive with the 
current activity fee. Student ac- 
tivities will get approximately 
$49,500 per semester with the $20 
activity fee as compared to $45,000, 
which is being collected from the 
current aebvity fee of $15. 

Engleman said that the main 
reason for the decision to increase 
the fee to $20 was to benefit the 
athletic department and the Health, 
Physical Education and Recreation 
(HPER) building when it is com- 
pleted. 

The activity fee funds will be split 
on a 55 percent activity, 45 percent 
athletic department allocation 
basis. The committee originally 
wanted a 53 percent activity, 47 
percent athletic department split, 



time assessment by taking a stand 
that part-timers do not benefit from 
the activity fee because of the small 
number of hours that they spend on 
campus. 

The investigating committee 
consisted of Engleman, KenSchenk, 
Roger Meriwether, Student Body 
President Ann Momper, and Senate 
President Steve Westrick, who in- 
vestigated just how much the fee 
should be raised. Even though the 
five decided lo raise the fee paid by 
full-time students, the decision of 
four was influenced more by 
necessity rather than by choice 
according toSenator Engleman. 

Engleman elaborated that she 
along with Schenk, Meriwether, and 
Momper are against the resolution 
and that Westrick is for It. 

"We don't like it at all. We agree 
that more money is needed, but it 
shouldn't come from other students, 
but from other sources," Engleman 
safd. 

Although Engleman regretted 
having lo serve on a committee to 
raise the activity fee, she felt that 
Ihe increase would have been 
inevitable anyway. 

"If Ihe Student Senate wouldn't 
have raised the activity fee, the 
administration would have, and for 
more money," Englemansaid. 



input 



students lo write letters during the 
week of March 9-14. Students will be 
requested lo write state represen- 
tatives asking for limitations on a 
proposed 12-18 percent increase in 
tuition at IPFW. A booth will be sel 
up in Ihe basement of Kettler Hall to 
manage theoperatlon. 

The Jan. 29 issue of The Com- 
municator reported that the State 
Budget Committee recommended a 



12 percent increase in student fees 
each year of the 1981-83 Indiana 
University budget. The article also 
reported lhat similar recom- 
mendations were made for Purdue. 

Senators Tom Harris and Bob 
Griebal will help set up the booth 
and ask students lo write Ihe letters 
with Ihe goal of limiting the tuition 
increase. The Senute will provide 
stamps and stationery and send out 
all letters, 

"We would like everyone from 



students to parents to dogs and cats 
to gel involved," said Harris. 

Harris and Griebal said the Senate 
is only trying (o limit the proposed 
increase in tuition, nol stop il 
completely. Their version of an 
increase is to raise student fees al 
least under 10 percent but definitely 
nol 12 percent or above. 

"A 12-18 percent Increase would 
make it financially Impossible for 
many students to oltend this com- 
pus,"sald Griebal. 



Althat point, Bartholomy said, she 
began pleading with Gaff to let her 
"just sign the ticket and forget the 
whole thing." She said, "I figured the 
cost of paying for my car being towed 
and everything jiist wasn't worth it." 

She said Gaff refused lo let her sign 
Ihe ticket saying it was too late 
because he had already called for city 
police assistance. 

Bartholomy said she couldn't figure 
out why Gaff was "harrassing" her. 
She asked Gaff what his badge number 
was, and he said "106." Bartholomy 
then realized that Sgt. Gaff was the 
same officer who had cited her for the 
Illegal parking. 

Bartholomy accused Gr-ff of 
harrassing her for "flipping him the 
bird" and for erroneously charging her 
with disregarding the stop sign. 

She said that she then became more 
"verbal" with Gaff who she said then 
said he "didn't take any lip off 
anyone— I do my job right." 

II was at this point, Bartholomy said, 
that Ihe city officers arrived lo assist 
Gaff in the arrest. Bartholomy claims 
officers told her to "shut up" when she 
tried to tell them her side of the story. 
She said they began to call her obscene 
names. 
Gaff, Bartholomy said, did not join 



in the name-calling, and then allowed 
thecity officers to take over. 

Bartholomy said she was told by the 
city officers "You have five seconds to 
sign this ticket or go downtown," 

She said she then asked the officers 
why Gaff hadn't stated why she was 
originally stopped and whether that 
information would be added to the 
ticket downtown. 

When she was told "no" to both 
questions. Bartholomy said she told 
the officers, "This is against every 
principle I hold dear," and said she 
would go to jail. 

Bartholomy said she then started 
toward Ihe officers' car, but one of the 
officers grabbed her arm. 

She said she pulled away from the 
officer saying she knew the way. Then, 
Bartholomy was thrown to the ground 
by the two city officers, her arms 
twisted behind her and handcuffs put 
on her wrists. 

She claims lo have sustained bruises 
and a cut lip in the scuffle. She also 
said that her hair was pulled and her 
face repeatedly pushed into the mud. 

Bartholomy said that one of the 
officers then said, "Good, now we have 
you for resisting arrest, too," 

Bartholomy said that she was not 
sure if Gaff was in on Ihe physical part 




President's budget 
could decrease aid 



By WAYNE STEFFEN 
Staff Writer 

Upon learning of President Ronald 
Reagan's proposed budget cuts in aid to 
higher education, many college 
students have been scurrying to bat- 
tered piggy banks, hammer in hand. 

Mark Franke, administrator of the 
IPFW financial aid office counsels with 
confidence. "We can still protect our 
students," he told The Communicator 

"All of these proposals have been 
around before Reagan took office. The 
president is the first to put them 
together in a single package," Franke 

There are four programs under the 
gun. 

General Student Loans iGSL) is a 
very important program lo this 
campus. The student goes to a local 
bank and, after meeting some 
requirements, takes out a loan at a 
reduced rale of interest. The Federal 
government pays all interest until the 
student leaves school, and then pays 
the difference between what the 
student is charged in interest and the 
market rate. 

"The President feels that many 
families who have the money lo send 
their children through college are 
borrowing anyway lo take advantage 
of the lower rate. Changes in the GSL 
program are to consist of tighlening 
Ihe requirements for eligibility," 
Franke said. 

The Basic Educational Opportunity 
Grant (BEOG) is another important 
program at IPFW. "The cuts here 
should be small. Comparatively 
peanuts. About 150 million dollars out 
of a 2.7 billion dollar program," 
Franke said. 

National Direct Student Loans 
(NDSL) and Social Security Students 
Benefits are less important programs 
locally. Reagan seeks lo quit funding 
them entirely. 

This does not mean the end of NDSL • 
however. Banks and government put 
up capital for loans and use collections 
from past loans to grant new ones. 
NDSL was begun in 1957 and has grown 
lo a four billion dollar fund wilh 2HU 
million coming in new monies an- 
nually. President Reagan wishes to 
stop the new funding over the next four 
years and make Ihe program self 
supporting. 



Social Security for students does not 
involve the financial aid office. 

Those who receive Ihese benefits 
would find them cut 25 percent per 
year for four years. And no new 
students would be put on the program. 
Reagan hopes lo realize a savings of 
1.7 billion dollars within five years and 
use the money to help the elderly and 
disabled. 

For good news Franke points to past 
growth and the possibility for more. 
"The money we have received in Basic 
Grants and State Grants has doubled 
in the past two years," he said. This 
means that Tor 1980-81 IPFW students 
got four million dollars in financial aid. 
And for the future Franke is not yet 
willing to "throw in the towel." 

Only a finite amount of money is 
available and it is distributed on a first 
come first served basis. The more 
applications received and the (aster 
(hey are turned in, the more the 
campus can expect back. "We handed 
out 4,000 applications this year and 
may hand out 5,000 nextyear," Franke 

"The more people who apply the 
better we will do in relation to other 
campuses," he said. "Many people 
who areeligible are still not applying," 

Franke counlcrs through student 
counseling. Last semester the 
financial aid office sent 2,300 an- 
nouncements to appeal lo students to 
apply, Franke also speaks at area high 
schools, 

"This office only determines who 
gets howmuchinaboulone third of the 
cases. Our main job is to match 
students with existing funds," he said. 
"So we ask every student to apply 
every year, and try to bring more 
money into Ihe local fund." 

Franke's advice to students is to 
apply early. Late applications have 
always been a problem, though in the 
past many late filers were able to get 
aid. That will no longer be true 
because the competition (or funds is 
getting much tougher because of lay- 
offs, inflation, and increased 
enrollments, he said. 

"There will be some shifting. Some 
students who got aid this year may nol 
next year That's a real hardship," 
Franke said "But this office will not 
closedown." 



Since the incident, Bartholomy has 
taken her complaint to Maurice Shady, 
chief of University Police and Safety, 
as well as to Vice Chancellor John R. 
Carnaghi and Chancellor Joseph P. 
Giusti. 

Shady told The Communicator that it 
would be inappropriate for him to 
comment on the incident because of 
any legal action that may result. He 
did say, however, that some of what 
Bartholomy told The Communicalor 
differs from Gaff's official version. 

Shady also maintains Bartholomy 
has changed her original story, 
altering various facts. 

Bartholomy has placed classified 
ads in both city newspapers seeking 
witnesses to the incident. 

Classmates of Bartholomy have 
admitted to seeing the incident but, 
"They don't want to get involved," she 
said. Several told her they fear 
reprisals by the campus police, she 
said. 

BULLETIN 
At the suggestion of Vice-Chancellor, 
John R. Carnaghi, Sgt. Larry Gaff of 
the campus police force and student 
Jane Bartholomy met in private 
Tuesday afternoon to discuss the in- 
cident of February 25 in which Gaff 
cited Bartholomy for disregarding a 
stop sign and which resulted in Bar- 
tholomy lodging a complaint of 
harrassment against Gaff- 
Maurice Shady, chief of University 
Police and Safety, told The Com- 
municator in a telephone interview 
Wednesday morning that according lo 
Gaff, for whom Shady said he was 
speaking, Bartholomy had changed 
parts of her original story. 

Shady said that Bartholomy's 
original complaint to him about Gaff 
included the charge that Gaff had 
participated in the physical part of her 
arrest (the pushing to the ground and 
handcuffing of Bartholomy) and that 
she was now saying Gaff wasn't in- 
volved in the physical part of the arrest. 
He also said Bartholomy now admits 
she may have run thestop sign. 

Bartholomy, however, in a telephone 
interview Wednesday morning denies 
admitting lo running the stop sign. 

Bartholomy told The Communicator, 
"I never changed my story. I had no 
reason to." 

She also said, "I'm definitely not 
dropping my complaint," about Gaff 
alleged harrassment of her. 

Bartholomy said that Gaff lold her at 
their meeting that he had assisted Ihe 
cily officers in handcuffing her. 

Shady said in a second telephone 
interview Wednesday that Gaff said he 
did help handcuff Bartholomy, but he 
did not aid in placing her on the ground 
and that he instead, was also on the 
ground as a result of Bartholomy 
failing into him when the city officers 
tried lo handcuff her. 

The Communicator has learned that 
Sgt. Gaffs official report of the incident 
says that he informed Bartholomy that 
signing the traffic citation written 
against her was not an admission of 
guilt that it was only a promise to ap- 
pear in court. 

Bartholomy, however, maintains that 
Gaff did not give her this information, 
and that it was the city officers who told 
her signing the citation was nol an 
admission of guilt. 

Bartholomy said (hat she and Gaff 
agreed that "It's just going to have to 
be decided in court." 



Profs seek raises 



ByJ.G.GRISWOLD 
Staff Writer 

Several IPFW professors, pleading 
for a pay increase, met with urea 
legislators in Indianapolis today. 

The meeting was organized by the 
local American Association of 
University Professors tAAUP), headed 
up by Richard Hess and Richard Hill, 
both members of IPFW's faculty. 

Hundreds of other professors from 
around the state also met at the same 
time with their legislators. 

AAUP expects Ihe House Ways and 
Means Committee lo recommend thai 
salaries for those in higher education 
nol be increased (or the next biennium 
(two years) and that student fees be 
increased 12 percent for the same 
period. The committee is also expected 
lo recommend that an 8 percent in- 
crease in salaries for other stale em- 
ployees be made. 

The House and the Senate are ex- 
pected to vote on and pass the 
recommended measure by late next 

Hess. Presidentelect of IPFW's 
AAUP. is worried about this measure. 
"IPFW is the best bargain in education 
in the state; a student can have a part- 
lime job, live at home and enjoy a good 
faculty But this quality is being 
jeopardized if the pay scale is kept at a 
1980 level for the next two years," he 
said, 

Hess believes there is a real concern 
thai the stand. irdol living will decrease 
for IPFW (acuity, making it difficult for 
some lo stay on leaching. 

"Younger faculty members who have 
to pay-o(( educational loans and still try 
lo live will be especially hurt the most," 
he said. 

"We (professors) are being treated 
unreal Is tically," Ness stated. "They 
don't tell NIPSCO dial they will have lo 
keep their rates at Ihe 1980 level for the 
next two years " 









OPINION

MARCH a, 1981 



Harrassment 
ugly charge 



disturbing accusation has been 
-made this week against the campus 
police force: A charge of harrassment 
has been leveled at one of its members. 

Such a charge is equally hard to prove 
or disprove. 

Hard because of the extremes in 
thinking among the people served by the 
• police. 

On one hand are 'those people who 
mink that any act of law en- 
forcement—from writing parking 
citations to issuing speeding tickets— is 
"harrassment." 

On the other hand, there are people 
who think police officers are super- 
beings— above human failings or 
emotions— who do no wrong, make no 
mistakes. 

■ Somewhere between the extremes lies 
the truth. 

Police officers are human beings who 
must often contain their human 
emotions while performing their duties 
and enforcing the laws society dictates 
to them. 

1PFW police, like most officers on 
college campuses, face special 
problems. Unlike city, county and state 
-police, they have little diversity in their 
daily work. Their jobs consist mainly of 
controlling traffic and enforcing parking 
regulations. 

Week after week they serve the same 
10.000 students, often ticket the same 
violators they did the week or month 
before. 



We believe it is rare that a ticket is 
written here that is not fully deserved. 

We'd bet that 99.9 percent of all tickets 
written are based solely on the merits of 
the one incident being cited, not past 
confrontations between officer and 
student. 

However, when the ugly charge of 
harrassment is made, IPFW police 
cannot and do not plead their innocence 
based on past performances alone. 

With this week 's incident serving as an 
example, we can see that the ad- 
minis tration— from the police chief to 
the Chancellor— wants to get to the core 
of the problem. It wants to know if the 
charge of harrassment is warranted. 

The administration is taking an active 
part in settling this matter between 
student and police officer by scheduling 
interviews with them and any witnesses 
to the incident. 

We, the voice of students on this 
campus, ask three things: 1. If the of- 
ficer involved is innocent of the 
harrassment charge, we want to see him 
publically exonerated of the charge, 
perhaps by a statement from the ad- 
ministration, which the Communicator 
will gladly print; 2. If the officer in- 
volved is guilty, we want to see 
disciplinary action taken by the ad- 
ministration; 3. If any student (or non- 
student) saw the incident in question, we 
want him or her to step forward and tell 
the administration what he or she saw. 
It's not too late to "get involved."

For years the cries for 
more No Smoking areas in 
public buildings by non- 
smokers were ignored. 

However, officials have 
finally recognized that 
cigarette smoke is not only 
unpleasant to nonsmokers, 
but it is dangerous for them 
as well. 

Starley Pifer, head nurse 
al IPFW, said that cigarette 
smoking is a health risk to 
everyone, not just the 
smoker. Nonsmokers ex- 
posed to smoke-filled rooms -. 
for a period of time develop 
headaches, throat 

irritations, and asthmatic 
problems. 



Senator defends Senate, constitution 



: Dear Editor, 

'Perhaps, he hears a 

*' different drummer. Let him 

step to the music which he 

;■ hears." — Henry David 

Thoreau 

As a member of the 
Student Senate, I believe it is 
important to set the record 
'straight about the.; article 
dealing with resignations of 
Senate members in the 2-19- 
■ 81 Communicator. 

The three former Student 

Senate members quoted in 

- the article were Phil Pat- 

lerson, Scott Kuehn, and Jeff 

Sandy. The three were, in 

my opinion, OVERLY 

NEGATIVE about the 

Senate! As a 16-month 

Senate member, I was 

elected to the Senate before 

Kj and have served after the 

Jl* three quit. 

1 observed in them a need 



for affiliation they sought by 
forming an elite group that 
met behind closed doors. 
They sought people and 
issues to verbally attack. 
When the novelty wore off, 
they resigned. 

A member of the Senate is 
free to sponsor legislation, 
organize events, and 
promote or serve students' 
interests to his heart's 
desire. To- achieve much he 
or she must work with other 
people. The Senate is what 
you want it to be. Projects to 
be tackled need only 
imagination, and a 
willingness to do them. 
Patterson, Kuehn and Sandy 
did not seem to have the 
willingness to serve. 

The revision of the Senate 
constitution was 

scapegoated as, "Our hands 
were tied with rewritine the 



constitution." But less than 
10 hours were used to amend 
and vote on the constitution. 
A house needs a foundation 
and this constitution revision 
enacted a legislabve affairs 
group that lobbies with other 
Indiana colleges and elected 
public officials lo promote 
issues of imporOTOe to 
college students. 

The former Student" 
Senators agree that time was 
a major reason for 
resigning What 1 feet is the 
bottomline cause for 
Senators who resign and 
remain at this campus is 
money. 

Money in one form or 
another. Most Senators have 
lo work at jobs for money to 
pay for school related ex- 
penses. 

All Students' Government 
work is voluntary. If each 



Senator were paid (which is 
against Purdue fiscal policy) 
many good people would 
suddenly make time to serve 
Ihis campus. An alternative 
is lo find ways lo reward 
work other than money. For 
the quiling Senators to 
criticize volunteer work only 
weakens the organization. 

My challenge to you is, get 

m\"6jvffft*miifteil better. lb 

summary, 'Jquitters never 

win and winners never quit."

In fact, according to the 
World Health Organization, 
a nonsmoker in a smoke- 
filled room inhales so much 
carbon monoxide in an hour 
that it is the same as if he 
had smoked one cigarette. 

The problem lies with the 
sidestream smoke given off 
the end of a burning 
cigarette. The smoke 
pollutes the air with irritants 
which are inhaled. These 
irritants affect the lungs of 
nonsmokers and smokers 
alike. Carbon monoxide 
from the smoke cuts the 
small airways of the lungs 
and prevents them from 
delivering life-giving oxygen 
to the lungs.

Hege gives all for recital 



ByKAROLHERBER 
Chief Reporter 

"This was my night to 
show what I could do," said 
music student Kevin Hege, 
and that's just what he did 
during his recent senior 
voice recital at IPFW. 

In front of a sizable crowd, 
approaching 200 in number, 
he put together nine long 
months of preparation and a 
lot of talent to deliver a 
collection of classical pieces. 
His efforts were well paid off 
when he received an A for his 
excellent performance. 

As only one of the 
requirements needed to be 
fulfilled by Hege and others 
in the music education 
program, the recitals give 
the students an opportunity 
to show what they can do' 
whether it be vocal or in- 
strumental works. 

The recital counts as the 
entire voice grade for those 
in Hege's position and "is the 
single most important thing 
you can do as a music 
student," he said. 
Individuals must perform up 
to a certain level of ability 
and are graded for that ef- 
fort by school personnel. 

Hege has lived in the Fort 
Wayne area all of his lifeand 
he became interested in 
music while in high school. 
As a freshman at Bishop 
Luers, he had previously 
concentrated on mathe- 
matics because he 
was comfortable with the 
subject. It wasn't until he 
joined the school choir and 
"got turned on to music" by 
the choir director that he 



realized his interest and 
dedication to singing. 

He chose to pursue his 
music career at IPFW partly 
because of its close 
proximity to his home and 
the cheaper tuition rates 
here compared to the larger 
campuses — approximately 
$2,000 less per year than at 
IU Bloomington, according 
to Hege. But most notably he 
chose IPFW for the personal 
a I ten ti on he feels the campus 
gives its students. 

At Bloomington, Hege 
•said, unless you are one of 
the top music students, all 
you may get is a teacher's 
assistant to help you. He 
feels the overall atmosphere 
at IPFW, and particularly 
the music department, is far 
more personal and friendly 
than at the main campus 
because of the larger 
number of students enrolled 
there. 

The day of the recital 
found Hege anxiously 
arriving at the auditorium 
six hours in advance of his 
performance to "sweat it 
out" until the critical hour 
arrived. "I was frantic," he 
said, "totally climbing the 
walls." But the audience 
didn't seem to notice as they 
listened to his tenor voice for 
the45-minule performance. 

Hege picked his own 
material for the recital, 
some of which was suggested 
by his teachers. While his 
own tastes lie in the areas of 
folk music and ballads, the 
music department requires 
its students to choose and 
perform pieces from within 



the classical realm. 

With this in mind, he 
chose, arranged the music 
for, and sang a Dan 
Fogelberg number, 
"Netherlands," which was 
permitted because Hege 
said, "it lends itself to the 
classical realm." 

Accompanied by a string 
quintet and piano, other 
numbers he performed in- 
cluded selections from such 
classical artists as Handel, 
Beethoven and Tchaikovsky. 

The pressures building up 
prior to Hege's stage ap- 
pearance "weren't un- 
bearable," he said, "but they 
were there." This pressure 
helped him to perform well 
in front of the audience, he 
said He felt It was his duty to 
live up to the standards 
expected by the university as 
well as the standards he 
expected of himself. 

"You just learn to cope 
with it," he said, because 
"you want to do a good job. 
You just go on and try not to 
make that first mistake." 

Hege felt the audience 
helped him through the 
performance by providing 
the "spark" that kept him 
going. It gave him the desire 
to deliver a much better 
performance because he 
knew the people came to see 
him and he wanted to please 
them Because he could sing 
to so many of his family and 
friends in the audience he 
became more and more 
confident of himself and "fed 
on" that spark they 
provided, he said.

The first production of "I. 
Pagliacci" by the IPFW 
Opera Workshop was full of 
spectacle, action packed and 
anything butboring, hut still, 
it seemed as if we could have 
expected more from the 
university. 

The performance was 
mostly strong and confident, 
demonstrating a great 
potential for opera in Fort 
Wayne, but several details 
combined to give it an 
amateurish quality, making 
it seem almost like a high 
school production. 

One of the chief difficulties 
of the show was that it was 
often Impossible to 



Philharmonic features fiddler 



Byrd pleases mixed crowd 



By JAMIE WISE 
Staff Writer 

Arvel Byrd, Fori Wayne's 
celebrity fiddle player, 
joined the Fort Wayne 
Philharmonic Orchestra 
Saturday night for the an- 
nual "Pops" concert. 

The mixed crowd of 
business suits and cowhoy 
hats anticipated Byrd's 
appearance through Dahl's 
"Quodlibet on American 
Folk Tunes" and Richard 
Hayman's "PopsHoedown." 
Both pieces were highly 
reminiscent of "western" 
soundtracks and typical of 
how Hollywood and the high- 
brow set idealize the "wild 

In between the two pieces 
conducted by Ronald 
Ondrejka, Fort Wayne 
businessman Paul Smith led 
the orchestra through John 
Philip Sousa's "King Cotton 
March." Smith's wife, 
Ondrejka told the audience, 
had purchased the rights for 
him -to conduct through the 



Radiolhon held in this city 
last month, 

Byrd and his band joined 
the Philharmonic before 
intermission to lead them 
through six well-known jigs, 
reels and a waltz, "Over the 
Waves," recognized by 
many from cartoons and old 
movies. It was hard to say 
who led who on these 
numbers which sometimes 
lasted too long and were 
troubled with missed notes 
and off-tempo percussion. 

The second half of the 
show was entirely Byrd. 
Each piece was chosen to 
expose the audience to 
different kinds of fiddling. 
"Diggy diggy lou&gt;" a cajun 
number, featured Byrd and 
Brenda Lee Meyer, the only 
female of the group, har- 
monizing, "Listen to the 
Mockingbird" followed, 
which Byrd told the audience 
won him the "fiddluV con- 
test" at the Indiana State 
Fair in 1978. 

"I'll Go Steppin' Too," a 
bluegrass number recorded 



recently by Emmy Lou 
Harris, was sung by Meyer 
whose voice is rich and full. 
An old standby of all 
bluegrass groups, "Fox on 
the Run," came after an 
original song of Byrd's "Sold 
to the Devil," a weak rock- 
bluegrass number with 
uninspired lyrics. 

The highlight of the 
evening and definitely the 
longest piece played by the 
band was Byrd's own 
composition "The Breakfast 
Suite." The title, Byrd ex- 
plained after the show, was 
the logical name for the 
piece because he practices 
and composes before 
"breaking fast" each 
morning. "Suite" was in- 
teresting for its percussion 
and its breaks, as well as 
being a showpiece for his 
fiddling. 

Byrd, a classically-trained 
violinist who performed with 
the Fort Wayne Philhar- 
monic during its 1975-1976 
season, combined his 
education with' the influence 



of jigs, haunting gypsy 
themes, rock and jazz. 

Not wanting his own fans 
to go away disappointed, 
Byrd wound up with a 
Charlie Daniels hit "The 
Devil Went Down to 
Georgia" and the "Orange 
Blossom Special." On the 
"Special" he managed the 
accomplished speed 
required of all those who 
attempt it. 

Although the amplification 
system was static and better 
suited to smaller halls, the 
backup was solidly tight 
through the set. Chris 
Bechler, a Fort Wayne 
drummer, played a trap set 
with finesse. Other Fort 
Wayne musicians were Chip 
McDaniels on bass guitar 
and Brenda Lee Meyer, 
vocals, conga drums, 
tambourine and shaker 
beads. Mark Buckles on 
pedal steel guitar and David 
Hill on lead guitar also in the 
backup band, were both 
from Nashville. 



distinguish the words. The 
opera may as well have been 
sung in Italian. Of the 
principal roles, this problem 
was greatest with Dorothy 
Kiltaka's Nedda. Kittaka's 
voice was powerful and 
emotional, but without the 
gloss in the program, it 
would have been hard to tell 
what she was singing about. 

Lincoln Chapman, as 
Canio, also sang with 
authority. He had strong 
breath support and projected 
his voice very well, but he, 
too, could not be easily un- 
derstood. Larry Reed, as 
Tonio, came off the best. The 
difference was that he 
enunciated his words clearly 
and distinctly. He was ex- 
cellent In the Prologue, as 
well as the scene in which he 
professed his love for Nedda. 

Another problem with the 
production was the quality of 
the acting. Granting that the 
opera should be somewhat 
melodramatic, evincing 
pathos rather than true 
tragedy, it nevertheless got 
out of control in this case. 
Perhaps this could have been 
helped by some 

collaboration with the IPFW 
theatre department in the 
form of coaching in 
movement. 

The best acting per- 
formance came from 
Chapman as the jealous and 
vindictive Canio. Reed was 



also effective as the hunch- 
backed Tonio. 

One positive aspect of the 
production was the com- 
petent orchestra, directed 
with authority by Anthony 
Adessa. However, the or- 
chestra was sometimes so 
loud that it overpowered the 
singers. 

The opera was produced at 
Concordia High School 
because IPFW, as yet, lacks 
adequate facilities. 
However, a still larger stage 
than the one at Concordia 
would have been useful. The 
chorus scene in Act I 
crowded the stage so com- 
pletely that the blocking 
seemed rather artificial. The 
large chorus added to the 
spectacle, but there just 
wasn't enough room for 
the principals to , move 
around. 

The set was rented from 
the Whitewater Opera 
Company. It was adequate 
but here again, some in- 
terdepartmental collab- 
oration might have allowed 
for a greater effect. 

The Opera Workshop, 
headed by Dr. Joseph 
Meyers, will give two more 
performances of "I. 
Pagliacci." Hopefully, most 
of the flaws will be worked 
out by then, but even in its 
present state, the show is 
enjoyable and gives Fort 
Wayne residents a chance to 
expand their cultural 
horizons. 



Deniro performance powerful 



TJulP packs wallop 



By MIKE GEFFEN 
Chief Reporter 

"Raging Bull" has the 
emotional kick of one. 

Director Martin Scorsese 
goes right for the guts and 
never lets go. He has made a 
tough, grim film about an 
unsavory, somewhat 
dispicable person— Jake 
LaMotta. As depicted in 
"Bull," La Motta is a 
creature moulded of urban 
violence. He is a man filled 
with seething anger and 
prone to jealous rages and 
vicious outbursts. The brutal 
violence he wreaks in the 
ring is not only his 
profession, it's his life. 

Scorsese is not as much 
interested in the details of 
LaMotta's life as he is in 
showing the environment 
that spawned a person like 
LaMotta. Scorsese seems to 
be saying that since LaMotta 
lives in a violent world, 
violence is ail he knows and 
all he can react with. The 
film is a sobering character 
study and makes one wonder 
how many more LaMottas 
there are out there. 

Every dramatic Scorsese 
film has a strong, angry 
character at its center, who 
is Irving '? dial with the 
realities of life in a harsh 



urban world. In many ways, 
LaMotta is a synthesis of 
these characters, per- 
sonifying the brutality at 
their core. 

In most of his films, 
Robert DeNiro has played 
that character. It is amazing 
that in all their 
collaborations, "Mean 
Streets", "Taxi Driver" and 
"New York, New York," 
Deniro and Scorsese have 
shown a different aspect of 
this character. It is no dif- 
ferent in "Raging Bull." 
DeNiro shows LaMotta's 
anger perfectly, and pin- 
points it so that a simple look 
denotes it- 
There is one scene in 
particular that shows the 
craft of this magnificent 
actor, and shows why he got 
his Oscar nomination. It is a 
simple scene where 
LaMotta's wife is talking to 
some friends of hers, and 
LaMotta's face is full of 
jealous tension. It is a 
striking image that sums the 
film up perfectly. 

The supporting cast is 
equally good. Joe Pesci as 
LaMotta's brother, and 
Cathy Moriarty as Vicki his 
wife, give compelling debut 
performances. Scorsese's 
excellent judge of talent is 



evident in these two actors, 
as they had never acted 
before this film. Pesci ef- 
fectively shows love and 
respect that turns to disgust 
because of LaMotta's tan- 
trums. Moriarity deftly 
shows the fear and love Vicki 
has for her husband. Both 
deserve their nominations. 

The film's gritty per- 
formances combine with its 
somewhat shadowy 
cinematography to give the 
film the hard-edged feel of a 
black and white film of the 
forties. Michael Chapman's 
cinematography juxtaposes 
shadows in some scenes with 
harsh key lighting in others 
and gives the film its semi- 
documentary film noir, if it 
can be called that, look. 
Chapman's cinematography 
and Scorsese's stylized use 
of sound are part of the 
reasons for "Bull's" strong 
impact. 

Besides being nominated 
for best picture, best 
director, best actor, sup- 
porting actor and actress; 
"Raging Bull" has also 
received nominations for 
Best screenplay, best 
cinematography, sound 
editing and editing. This list 
of nominations is im- 
pressive, and Scorsese's film 



should be the front-runner in 
the Oscars. 

"Raging Bull" is 
unequivocally Scorsese's 
best film to date. It is a 
shattering character study 
that shows the dehumanizing 
effects of violence. Scor- 
sese's LaMotta is a 
deliberately ambiguous 
character who makes us 
ponder where violence 
comes from. All in all, 
"Raging Bull" is »an 
emotionally overpowering 
film that knocks us out and 
leaves us down for the count.

Students display art 



By NANCY SLICK 
Stalf Writer 

The artwork of many 
IPFW art students is 
currently being displayed in 
the gallery of the First 
Presbyterian Church on 
West Wayne St. The works, 
which include paintings, 
sketchings, weavings, 
sculptures and prints, are 
demonstrative of the 
creative spirit that dwells In 
the hearts and minds of 
many. 

Some of the pieces show 
tenderness, charm and even 
humor. Some brim with 



vitality and others sport a 
leisurely grace. They are 
bright, colorful and fluid. 
Many pieces are simplistic, 
others are delicately in- 
tricate, and all evoke feeling 
and emotion. 

The art students are 
pleased with the exhibit and 
their opportunities to display 
their works for public view. 
They've worked hard to 
transfer their sentiments to 
the canvas or stone, and they 
enjoy sharing with their 
viewers. 

"They like to work on a 
piece and hang it up and 



have people look at it and 
think about it — good, bad, 
indifferent. Like anyone, 
they like praise," said IP- 
FW's Professor Garcia, 
teacher of sculpture and 
drawing. "There's some fine 
work. It's to be com- 
mended." 

Visiting public inspected 
the exhibit enthusiastically 
and reacted with curiosity, 
chuckles and warmness. A 
frequent reaction to the 
exhibit, which continues 
through March 27, was, 
"Hmmm. Interesting."

Men finish 
'80-81 play 
with loss 



By TIMOTHY J. ROSS 
Sports Editor 

IPFW's men's basketball 
team ended its 1980-81 season 
last week, finishing with a 9- 
17 record 

On Thursday Feb. 26. the 
Tuskers lost their final game 
to St. Joseph's ol Renns- 
selaer, A Division II team. 
At the buzzer the score read 
108-92. 

The Tuskers were defeated 
by the division II team, but 
"We played well enough to 
win several games. We saw 
the difference between 
Division II and Division III. 
IPFW was "overpowered by 
St. Joseph's size and con- 
sistency in outside 
shooting," said Head Coach 
Ken Workman. 

St. Joseph's guards 
dumped in 32 points and 6'9" 
Neville Brown added 29 
points and dominated the 
floor with 16 rebounds. The 
Tuskers were ou (rebounded 
57-38. St. Joseph poured in 61 
percent from the field. 

Brown however was 
ou [scored by a Tusker 



Rickie Smith had his 
season and career high as he 
contributed 36 points to the 
Tusker cause. 

According to Workman, 
Brian Grady, Gary Rinard, 
and Kendall Murphy all 
played good games; and 
Mike Schaeler came off the 
bench (o play his best game 
of the season 

Two other players were 
injured in the game. Phil 
Shideler received an elbow 
lo the head, and Scott Morris 
rcinjured his knee. 

"Everyone . played well. 
We have shown in our last 
three or four games the 
ability to overcome our lack 
of patience. We played a 
more steady game," said 
Workman. 

Smith led the scoring with 
his record scoring 36 points. 
He was followed by Grady 
with 20 and Rinard with 17 

Although their number of 
losses is greater than their 
number of wins, the 
Tuskers have achieved 
victories on other fronts.

There is more to a game than 
winning or losing. 

This is the first season that 
any of the team has played 
on the same team. That 
means they began as in- 
dividuals and worked at 
becoming a team. Each had 
to learn and this season 
proved to be a valuable 
learning experience since 
most of the team will be 



reluming next season. 

"I am really pleased with 
the team's progress. They 
are starting to mature. They 
show a willingness to work 
and with this winning will 
come," Workman said. 

"You have to measure not 
only wins, but also progress 
and willingness of players to 
sacrifice for and take care of 
the team's needs," he added.

There's something to be 
said for scheduling cream- 
of-the-crop competition. So, 
what did volleyball coach 
Arnie Ball have to say about 
last week's match at Ohio 
State? 

"I hope we never have to 
play them again," Ball said, 
after the Buckeyes ad- 
ministered the Tuskers a 
lesson in volleyball, 15-0, 15- 
7, 15-3. "They were by far 
better than us," he admitted. 
"We were very in- 
timidated." 

IPFW played host to 
Cincinnati Saturday, their 
first conference match of the 
season. "I really felt we 
could beat them " Ball said, 
his voice trailing off, ' 'but we 
didn't." The Bearcats top- 
pled IPFW, 15-7, 15-7, 15-11. 
"Our defense played much 
better and our pass-serving 
was better than in the past, 
though it still wasn't good. 
We controlled the middle, 
but the outside ( play) is what 
killed us." 

Cincinnati is hosting an 
invitational this weekend 
and the Tuskers will take 
part. "I talked to the Cin-

next year. 

The Tusker squad bowed 
out of the 1980-81 campaign 
with a 53-4-1 loss to Saint 
Mary's of South Bend, in the 
Northern District Division 
III tournament. The tour- 
nament, hosted by IPFW 
was played at the Concordia

Mary's was the eventual 



champion of the tournament. 
Three games on Friday

Although the men's and 
women's basketball seasons 
have ended, the avid 
basketball fan may still 
enjoy the sometimes serious, 
sometimes comical per- 
formances of the Intramural 
basketball squads. 

This year's competition 
seems to be relatively rough 
as three teams have yet to be 
defeated The undefeated 
teams as of Feb. 25 are the 
All Stars, The Wad Bombers, 
and Stoneface IT, 4-0, 3-0, and 
4-0 respectively. 

In last week's 7:30 p.m. 
competition, the Sig Eps 
forfeited to The Sting; The 
Wind defeated the Dwarfs &amp; 
Marvin, 61-50; the Main 
Frames downed the "81"8's, 
63-37, and the New Comers 
walked all over Delta Sigma 
Phi, 71-32 

In the 8:30 games the New 
Comers outscored Schoenles 
Little Kings, 71-51; the 



People's Choice won over the 
Sky Kings, 45-52, Stoneface 
n beat the Sky Kings, 65-61, 
and the All Stars dropped 
Thisisus, 64-48. 

The chronic basketball fan 
can attend the intramural 
sessions on Monday and 
Wednesday nights at the 
Concordia Theological 
Seminary. There is a 
schedule of the games posted 
on the bulletin board outside 
of the Athletic Office in Walb 



jusl barely held on to post a 
71-68 victory. 

The Tusker scoring was 
headed by Ann Klop- 
fenstein's 17 points. Kathleen 
Smith came off the bench to 
pour in 15 points and Karen 
Dircksen added 10 Teresa 
Woodard of Tri State was the 
game's leading scorer, as 
she hit for 27 points. 

That victory placed Coach 
Voisin's squad into Satur- 
day's showdown with top 
seeded Saint Mary's. The 
game was actually two 
seperate contests. The first 
half was won by IPFW, as 
they left the court leading 30- 
28 at the half. 

The second half brought 
about a total collapse of the 
Tusker offense as they could 
hit for only 14 points. On 
many occasions the Tuskers 
were getting only one shot, 



as the taller Saint Mary's 
team controlled the boards. 

Ann Klopfenstein led the 
Tuskers with II points, and 
Karen Dircksen added 9. 

The second half downfall 
could be attributed to 
several factors Coach 
Voisin said, "We tired out in 
the second half, We had to 
play in the final game on 
Friday night, and Saint 
Mary's had a bye." Also, the 
Tuskers had only a seven 
player roster, whereas, Saint 
Mary's had ten players to 
call on for game action. 

Commenting on the team's 
7-16 record Voisin said, "We 
accomplished the goals that 
we had set out for early in 
the season, and no matter 
how bad things got we never 
gave up." Again, it was the 
glaring problem of having 
the team together for only 



one year at a time that hurt 
this year's squad. "It's hard 
finding consistency when 
every year a new group of 
players try out for the 
Team," Voisin said. 

Hopefully several mem- 
bers of this year's team will 
be back next season. Ann 
Klopfenstein, Sue Hendricks, 
Amy Brunew, and Kathleen 
Smith have indicated that 
they will probably return for 
another year. Hendricks was 
named to the all- tournament 
team over the weekend, and 
Klopfentstein received 
honorable mention. 

All four are un- 
derclassmen which could be 
the foundation for a solid 
program in the years to 
come. The addition of a few 
quality high school recruits 
could turn this team into an 
instant winner next season.

Earlham (o date, including
