FoUett's comes clean about book return 



by Cawii; HjlUr 
Chief Reporler 



Ed Leonard, professor of business and man- 
agemeni sciences, holds Pollen's booksiore 
responsible for selling sludents a defective prod- 
uei. 

Leonard said business sludenis purcbascd 
copies of Ihe annual cdiiion of "Business 
Elbics" for use in a business cihics class only to 
find out thai Ibe books were defeciive. A num- 
ber of the new and used books contained major 
printing errors. There were several pages miss- 
ing, as well as blank pages in ihe books. 

According to Leonard, sludents returned the 
books lo die booksiore and, if ibey bad pur- 
chased a new book, ihey were given a replace- 
ment If students had purchased a defective used 
copy of the text, they were forced to turn in iheir 
defective copy and pay [he difference for a new 
copy According to Leonard, Gary Brantley. 
store manager of Folletl's, said snidcnis would 
have to pay the difference since the bookstore 
did noi purchase the used books from Ihal pub- 
lisher 

"Regardless of where Follctt's had secured 
ihe books and wbeiher ihey were new or used, ii 
IS a fact that Pollen's sold a defective product." 
Leonard said. 

He said he called die publisher to solve ihe 
issue "I didn't think it was my responsibility as 
a professor to call the publisher. I dioughi it was 
the bookstore's." he said 

Leonard said ihe pubUshers became aware of 
the defect early in the fall semester The pub- 
lishers assured Leonard they had sent letters to 
all bookstores serving faculty who had ordered 
the lexi for use in their classes. 

"I can only assume that someone in the 
Folletl's chain received a copy of die letter." 
Leonard said, "Siudenis were sold defective 
copies prior to the sian of the spnng semester 
Some of ihese were new and some were not 



new li would appear thai since 
Folletl's knew of the defect problem 
thai they should have addressed it and 
ensured thai no student received a 
defective new or used lent. But they 
did not." 

"Nevertheless. Pollen's sold Ihe 
defeciive product and the customer, our 
siudenLs. were responsible for righting 
ihc wrong, " Leonard said 

The publisher later called Leonard,^ 
and informed him the defective books 
would be replaced by new ones, as 
long as the total number of returns was 
not greater Uian die original new (e;tt 
order Leonard said the publisher 
would also pay for postage bodi ways, 

Leonard then wrote a letter to die 
bookstore as well as Walt Branson, 
vice-chancellor of financial affairs, 
staung the publisher's policy. 

About six weeks went by and 
l^onard said neidier the bookstore nor 
Branson had contacted him regarding 
his leitcr, 

Brantley said he contacted the pub- 
hsber and was informed dial the books 
could not be returned since they had been put- 
chased elsewhere. 

Upon receiving Leonard's letter, in which the 
publishers told him that they would refund die 
new and used Ixwks alike. Brantley called the 
publishers again 

"1 then called ihe publishers and told Uiem 
thai 1 was gelling two different stories. " 
Brandey said. 'They told I^onard ihai the books 
could be relumed, and initially they told me that 
the used books could not be relumed. It was 
then that die publishers lold me thai they would 
have no problem retummg ihe used books " 

Brandey said he tned to make contact with 
Leonard after he spoke with die publishers "1 
left a message because 1 wanted to discuss ii 
with him (Leonard) and be didn't get it." 




niley said "1 just dioughi everything was 
okay at ibat point," 

"As far as I know it's resolved," he said. 
"The sludents widi used books can refund them 
for new books, and diosc who initially paid die 
difference for a new book can also be refunded " 

"I figure that two mondis is sufficient ume 
lor reconciliation of a conflict," Leonard said. 
"Now I'm supposed lo get the names of my stu- 
dents who have the defective used copies and 
give it lo the book.viore. 

"Who has the responsibility to make sure the 
sludents don't get screwed* Obviously it was up 
10 me in diis case." Leonard said, "Pollcirs 
appears lo steadfasdy adhere lo their own self- 
serving policies and procedures, no mailer what 
the circumstances " 



VP race 
draws close 



by S. Brant Kelky 
News Editor 
and Nol Beckley 
Editor 

Like die IPSGA presidential 
race, the bidding for the 
vice presidency is heating 
up in preparation for next week's 
student vote 

Tan 'Tony" Bui. Chris Douse, 
J Tilden Brown and Tony Laux 
are vying for the student govenn- 
meni's second -highest post, 

Bui. a senator, president of the 
Iniernaiional Students' 

Organization and member of the 
Association of Computing 
Machinery, said he is running 
because student government needs 
to emphasize leadership and 
involvement with student life 
Furthermore, he says students' 
interests are being shoved aside in 
favor of special mteresis 

A management information sys- 
tems major, Bui said he wants to 
know why tuition and fees have 
continued lo rise and where the 
additional funds are going. He said 
be also wants to work lo transfer 
Walb Union operations from the 
continuing education department 
10 students, so they are free for stu- 
dent use, 

Bui said he thinks students 
should voice their opinions more 
than they do: loo many people are 
complaining about their problems 
rather than working together to 
solve them, according to Bui 

He said he has spoken to many 
students who have transferred 
because of the stagnant student life 
at this campus, as well as infight- 
ing and a lack of campus progress 
But that is not die way lo deal wiih 
problems, he said 

"For the last couple of years, 
only 600 or 700 people voted (on 
the technology tee) out of 12.000," 
Bui said, "People have die voice .,. 
Sludents are the bncks. the wire ,,. 
but they don't form a building. It 
can't be 'us' and 'them,' " 

Douse, the current president's 
chief of staff, said he wants to look 
into Walb Union expansion and 
levelling off of tuition levels. 

Douse said he wants lo allocate 
more space in Walb lor student use 



and expand die student union. He 
said he also wants to continue his 
work with diversity. 

Douse said his agenda is most 
in Ime with presidential candidate 
Cieorge Gounaris' and would work 
to make die senate more proactive 
on issues than has previously been 
the case 

Brown was the first person lo 
declare his vice-presidential candi- 
dacy He said he is campaigning 
on the lack of parking space, low- 
ering student fees and improving 
the student union, among others. 

"My goal as VP IS to facili- 
tate student involvement in issues 
students have," Brown said "1 saw 
the siudent government doing 
nothing .,. the best way to gel 
somediing done was lo be presi- 
dent " 

Brown said be wants to rally 
students around issues He wants 
lo "encourage students to actively 
use their rights," 

To accomplish their goals, how- 
ever. Brown said students must 
still support the government, 
IPSGA can be there for the stu 
dents, but they must stdl walk in 
he said 

"Without student support, we 
have no backing," Brown said, 

Laux, 24, a criminal Justice 
major from Columbia City, is a 
first-semester senator and chair of 
the IPSGA legislative committee. 
He said be thinks student govern- 
ment has done well this year, 

"1 think this year's administra- 
tion (IPSGA) has done die best 
thai they can," Laux said. 

The real power lies in the uni- 
versity adminisirauon. Laux said. 
Tbe student govenuneni has taken 
an unfair amount of heat when Uie 
university administration has more 
control over the campus' affairs, 
according to Laux. 

Laux said he wants to see the 
students and IPSGA get along bet- 
ter than they have in the past 

Laux said he isn't running a 
very aggressive campaign because 
be wants to avoid mudslinging. 
"I'm really kind of disappointed ... 
in the negadve campaign," he said 
He also said he will remain on the 
senate if he loses

Editor 

Smoke fills ibe pub The gcnlJe roar of 
the palions begin lo sofien as ihe firet noles 
of a hanDonica glide uvcr ihe crowd. The 
people selOe and begin lu hum along lo 
familiar songs and noi so familiar songs. A 
young woman, who knows all Ihe words, 
sways her bead back and fonh in rythmic 
ecslasy. The musician chides her fur leav- 
ing as soon as the song ends, but he knows 
she will he hack The young woman is pan 
of the dedicated following David Todoran 
has developed in his IS years of making 
melodic love to his guitar and harmonica. 

Todoran played solo but he was sup- 
ported by "Super Dave," who brought him 
anoihcr "Rolling Rock " Usually. Todoran 
plays wilb his band. Zig Zag Railroad, 
which is a conglomeration of former bar 
bands like The Hammer Heads and The 
Jury, 

Todoran said he usually caters the kind 
of music he plays lo the kmj of aowd he 
expects, 

'Tbc music Ls different for a solo show 
than with the band 1 use a different set of 
images and use different ways to approach 
venues." Todoran says "It's just Rock and 
Roll. We don"! really try lo get too deep " 
Todoran's lalesl dip in the shallow end is 
Zig Zag Railroad's second CD. "DisLiiice" 
which has met favorable reviews. 



D^21SsQZIS3 



Zig Zag Railroad's latest CD. 
"Disiance," features the single "Wheels" 
which could can be considered deep. 
Todoran said he wrote the song in the 
memory of Sieve "Wheels" Staker. 
"Wheels" was the brother of Todoran's 
drummer, Mark SlaJcer. Todoran smgs, "I 
hope your dreams come true. I hope your 
colors be as bright as rainbows." The word 
"colors" has another meaning which is 
clear to bikers. Colors are whai bikers wear 
on the ir jackets. 

Todoran said he knew the song 
"Wheels" was something special before 
Zig Zag Railroad ever stepped into the 
recording studio. "We had immediate feed- 
back from our live sets. People were com- 
ing up to us in between sets and asking us 
what Ihe song was even before ihey knew 
the words. When we went into the studio 
wc spent more time on 'Wheels' than any 
other song," Todoran said. 

"Wheels," which was played in heavy 
totaUon by WXKE Rock 104, is only the 
firsl of several tracks on this CD to be 
played on WXKE 

"I predict this CD hitting its stride this 
summer. We're not done with this CD 
yet." said WXKE DJ 'Doc" Rick West. 

West has worked with Todoran ai a 
number of "gigs." The two met several 
years ago when Todoran was a jazz and 
rock musician. 

"He was preity pure in his musical Ic.m- 



ings. much more of an artist. Now he is 
much more fundamental as to where the 
market is," West said 

"This town has a lot of talented musi- 
cians, but David makes the right sleps, 
David gets booked at Pierre's, Billy's and 
Columbia Street West and he is willing to 
play familiar songs If a band plays all 
unfamiliar songs how can an audience 
gauge how good they are or if they make 
misiakes," Wesl said, 

Todoran has been called one ot the best 
musicians in Northern Indiana by Jeb 
Waldschmidl. saxophonist for rival Fort 
Wayne band. Cool Blue and Ihe Altitude, 

"Next to me. of course," Waldschmidl 
laughed, 

Todoran. an English literature major. 
said classes have helped him realize where 
he made mistakes in the past in his song 
writing. He has also figured out why some 
songs were successful and popular and 
why others were noi. 

"When I am hacking away at a song, I 
begin to look at it from a 'cntio-' point of 
view and see what I liked and why," 
Todoran said 

Todoran's style of music has changed 
throughout bis career. In the early 80s. 
Todoran was pari of a "new wave" band 
while living in Florida, but Todoran's

band wiih Kenny Taylor. "TTie Red 
Belly Boys," The 'Boys were 
almost signed by a major lecoTding 
label, but the deals fell through. 
Todoran even mel REM before 
their supcrsiardom He and the band 
stayed in contact for a few years 

Todoran says he does not want 
to be thought of as a "his been" of a 
group that saw the brass ring but 
just could not grab it. Todoran 
fondly remembers his days with 
"The Red Belly Boys" and still 
plays with Taylor occasionally. 
"Tlie Red Belly Boys" reunited for 
one show last Saturday during a 
television taping at 1lie Lx)fl. 

"What we do now is just as vital. 
The whole thing is like an albatross 
hanging around my neck." Todoran 
said Although he does not regret 
what be and the Red Belly Boys did 
musically then, be wants to be 
judged by what be Ls douig musical- 
ly now. 

Tbe biggest change in Todoran's 



music is his source of inspiration 
Todoran's wife, Kathy. gave birib 
to a daughter. Hadlcy. two and a 
half years ago. 

About his daughter's birth. 
Todoran says, "It definitely changes 
your life and it gives you a much 
different perspective You really 
Stan 10 understand your parents. " 

Todoran. 36. said he was 
exposed to many different styles of 
music by his older brothers and sis- 
ters. When he got older he began to 
listen to the blues rock of the 70s, 
like '/.?. Top and Led Zeppelin 
Later he betamc interested in Stevie 
Ray Vaughn in an attempt to 
uncover the roots of the music he 
enjoyed. 

"I want to gel close to the source 
of what became rock and roll," 
Todoran said. 

"The kind of music we do 
reflects our age. We are not as 
angry as a younger band would be," 
Todoran says 

Todoran thinks he still has a 
good chance to make ii after several 
years in the business He says some 
agents have been inlercstcd in his 
songs. He may not he ready lo pan

Staff Editorial 



Slim pickins' between this year's candidates 



Ahoul Ibis time during an 
election, a newspaper will 
single oui one candiJate to 
endorse. We ai The Communicalor 
gave (his some ihought and did 
much research in the bope of find- 
ing a candidate lo our liking who 
would t&gt;esi represent the students 
We were disappointed wiiti the 
findings and we have decided not lo 
back any of the candidates. 



Geo Gounans bas ibe guts lo 
lake on the adminisuaiion hut has 
only said what he wants to do. To 
win us over, he needs lo show us he 
has clear strategies to achieve his 
goals Otherwise, it is the same 
song, just a different singer, 

Kerry Adkins would have made 
a good president because be has 
great enthusiasm for the job. But 
with much debaie surrounding his 



participation ui the inception of stu- 
dent e-mail and the technology fee 
(some mistakenly say he tried to 
ball the availability of the service), 
many have perceived his efforts as 
self-serving. 

Both of these candidates have 
worthy qualities which would make 
either of them a suitable president. 
It is 100 bad Gounans and Adkins 
can't meld together and be Siamese 



presidents of [PSGA. Alone, 
Gounaris has a shade of Kevin Eads 
in him, and Adkins smells like 
Mark King in spirit. 

In an effort to be fair to both 
candidates we are taking the easy 
way out and not supporting either 
candidate We decided no endorse- 
ment was better than a half-hearted

Last week, my column feaiuied 
what IS decent about IPFW, This 
week's column will try lo oppose 
the seamy underbelly of this univer- 
sity In other words, "The Mickey 
Mouse Bullshit that pisses me off at 
IPFW.- 

Why do students use valuable 
time in the computer labs to play 
solitaire? Playing solitaire on a com- 
puter is like hunting Tor goldfish 
with a speurgun. Here's a quick 
news Hash for all you losers who do 
diis — buy a deck of cards! If you are 
going to he monopolizing valuable 
computer space, at least do some- 
thing you can only do on a comput- 
er. Go to a chat room or try to find 
naked pictures of Ruth Buzzi 
Maybe you are so caught up m your 
own existence you fail lo realize 
other people need to use the com- 
puter for actual scholarly work. This 
is a university right? 

Another thing which gels under 
my skin is la/y -ass people who can't 
make the effort to open a door and 
instead use the handicapped access 
doors They must be the same peo- 



not have the 
gift of proper 
leg motion. The 
disabled access 
doors are used so much that many 
are broken. I know the disabled 
conmiuniiy is not abusing the doors, 
so the problem 

must lie with 

us "noniial" (1

"...like The

Do 

math , there 
are around 
10.000 stu- 
dents (that fig- 
ure is dropping 
faster than 
your IQ dur- 
ing a Problem

and only a 

small percentage of those have 

physical disabilities. 

Professors who bitch about not 
having a parking space within spit- 



ting distance of their building also 
have put a stinkbug the si^.e of 
Manhattan up my bull. I just have 
one request for the small minonly of 
professors who bitch, "QUIT E- 
MAILING THE WHOLE 
DAMNED CAMPUS ABOUT 
HOW TOUGH rr IS TO CARRY 
YOUR SUPPLIES TO THE 
CLASSROOM! Just do it!" 

For my last biich I would like to 
ask someone why I was not inviied 
to the student leadership banquet. I 
have led this paper for nine inniiUis. 
and no matter what anyone thinks 1 
believe I have done a decent job. If 
you do not like what 1 have had to 
say this year, then go to therapy, ask 
the university to pay 

tor It and force me 

lo resign tlike 
The Communi- 
cator bas S9,500 to 
appease every dis- 
traught student). 
The campus slush

your complaints to

If you do have the 
mental capacity to 
deal with issues on 
an intelligent basis, 
wnte a letter lo the

expect us to respond 

to you in an intelli- 
gent manner, though. Just look at 
this column and do the math or 
English or whatever 



Society can know 
God through Christ 



•^.S. Brant 
Kelley 




This pasi weekend witnL'sscU the 
most iniportani holiday ^.^ef And 
each succeeding Easter will 
become more important than the 
preceding one because each passing 
year grants humanity less time than 
before to lurn to the God who is 
celebrated. 

The names, faces, races and 
technology of this world have 
changed, but it is substantively the 
same: people still desire a secure 
future, to have meaning in life and 
people siill have their natural phys- 
ical tendencies built-in 

Jesus Christ addressed ancient 
Israel with the same fundemental 
problems confronting today's mod- 
em world: man's meaning in the 
universe and his relauonship to his 
creator. People today want solu- 
tions to these problems, whether or 
not some deny they exist 

We attempt to find meaning in 
gratifying ourselves, Bui every 
drunken revelry comes with a 
hangover, every promotion comes 
with a headache and every dollar 
comes with more taxes attached 



The good news 
is there is some- 
thing more in 
store for man 
than self-indul- 
gence or reduc- 
ing himself to 
being a slave lo 
his own desires 
and instincts. 

In today's open 
and permissive 
culture, almost 
anything is fair 
game for discussion (.uid compro- 
mise) Almost. Death in a personal 
sense is not a popular subject. 
While some are wiHing to address 
the great equaliut as a third party, 
sooner or later each and every last 
one of us will deal with it on a first- 
person basis. 

Question: If you were to die 
today, and God ask you why He 
should allow you into heaven, what 
would your answer be? 

God is not an unknowable, con- 
sensus being He is mankind's cre- 
ator and will, like it or not, ulti- 
mately be mankind's judge. I have 
yet to meet anyone willing lo claim 
to be without fault With this in 
mind, why would God let anyone 
into His kingdom? 

The social issues of today are 
important enough; we talk about 
them and I write about them But 
abortion, euthanasia, crime and 
out-of-control government are only 
symptoms of a deeper problem: 
man's sinfulness 

Jesus was a great man, a wise 
teacher and a myriad of other com- 



pliments heaped upon Him by most 
of my colleagues. The grave where 
Joseph of Arimethea laid the Christ 
is empty because He overcame 
death For those who accept His 
blood and death as their free ticket 
10 heaven, they know why God 
should let them in. 

Now is the lime of year when 
we celebrate His most important 
event during His ministry on earth: 
His death and resurrection. This 
event has given the entire human 
race hope, meaning for life and a 
renewed relationship to its creator. 

Just days before His death. He 
stood on the outskirts of lenisalcm 
and lamented that the people didn't 
recognize Him as the savior and 
messiah 

Hiding behind a wall of doubt, 
unbelief and outright rejection, 
most of mankind has turned anoth- 
er way or refused to believe that 
something which isn't m any way 
cheap could possibly be free He is 
still wecpmg for those who don't, 
or won't, recognii^e He is the way 
to know God, For anybody who 
reads the Journal Gazette, take a 
look at the comic, 'B C ' by 
Johnny Hart; it is indicative of 
humanity's reaction to God's plan 
forreconciUaiion 

While man's darkness has alien- 
ated him from his God. Jesus' sig- 
nificant lour on our world allowed 
man once again to approach God; it 
even allows man to enter heaven, 
provided he has the right answer 
when Cod asks him the big ques-

BULLS ■ Magic rivalry set to become a classic 




Travis 
Stahl 



Afier waiching SunJayS NBA 
matcb-up belwcen (he Chicago 
Bulls and Ibe Orlando Magic, I 
have come (o die conclusion ibal 
(he NBA is Tioi dead afiei all, much 
10 my chagrin. Over the last two 
seasons Ihese Iwo teams have 
developed a rivalry ihai has pui die 
thnll back into the league. 

Only in the Eastern Conference 
could such a rivalry exist 
Remember the baiiles die Bulls and 
Pistons used lo wage' How aboul 
all the years the Pistons bad to fight 
the Celtics lo gel lo ihe top, or the 
mosi recent games between the 
Knicks and Pacers? The Bulls - 
Magic coDlesi is shaping up lo take 
its place alongside those epic wars. 



There 
are several 
factors caus- 
ing these two 
learns lo 
want 10 play 
against one 
anodier while 
at the same 
lime avoiding 
^94^ one another 

The first is 
home conn 
advantage. 
Uniil the 
Bulls victory on Sunday in Orlando, 
these two had difficulty beating one 
another on the road. Thai fact 
becomes mote evident when you 
look at both teams' home records. 
The Bulls have nol lost a game at 
die United Center diis season, and 
the Magic have only lost three 
games in the O-rena in the last two 
seasons combined. 

The second and most important 
factor is how the teams' .superstars 
perform against one another 
Michael Jordan cannot score against 
Nick Anderson, a lofty accompbsh- 
meni for Anderson under any cir- 
cumslanccs. I thought il was a fluke

It but, even when Jordan does score, 
Anderson is right there bounding 
him into making mistakes 

Scoltie Pippen suffers much the 
same fate as Jordan, only he cannot 
seem lo stop Anfernec Haidaway 
from scoring Pippen admitted that 
it IS harder for him to guard 
"Penny " than anyone else in the 
league Maybe that explains why 
Hardaway has averaged 27 points 
per game the last two years against 
Chicago. 

Shai]uille O'Neal hasn't really 
been Ihe deciding factor in games 
against the Bulls that he should 
have been The Bulls have no one to 
guard "Shag" and it seems he is 
able to score at will. For some rea- 
son he is unable to finish the game 
off. 

Ironically, the Bulls success has 
come by way of Orlando's game 
plan. The Magic defenders are often 
too slow to challenge, or fail to 
challenge the Chicago shooters at 
all. That fact alone has allowed

sharpshooters, like Kukoc. Pippen. 
Jordan and Sieve Kerr, it would 
definitely benefit the Magic to at

It appears evident that the Bulls 
and Magic will probably meet again 
in the Eastern Conference finals It 
is also evident that either team is 
capable of winning What makes 
diis senes unique is that it is diffi-

TIME FOR A CHANGE 

TIRED OF BEING IN THE 
DARK? 

One of this University's 
problems is the students have 
no idea of what is going on at 
this University. 

With use of the E-mail system, I will insure 
that not only will the students know what's 
happening, but students will be able to 
provide IPSGA with their input on matters 
that concern them. 

Let's make sure the University knows we 
mean business.

Sports by any other name still defines life 





~ -J^H 


^B Porter 

|B tUcu/i«U 






HBtoidM 



Ii cimc lo my .iifcniion rectnlly ihai 
iberc may be those who saunter across 
this plane! not enjoying sports. It has 
been ^aid Ihal there are even those who 
could core less ahoul ihc t&gt;ox scores and 
standings that appear in our daily news- 
papers. I have even beard it ullcred that 
there may be (hose who, heaven forbid, 
don'i lune into ESPN's Sports Center 
for a daily dose of the world's most 
important news. 

Ii is in those people (hai I address the 
following words. 

Sports is not merely an extension of 
life, il is life in many ways. The word 
sports, in and of iLself, offers a whole- 
some flavor of fairness, vigor and ea-se. 
Sure there are occasions when manipu- 



lation and cheatmg are 
uncovered, but for the 
most pari sports is the 
essence of the good life. 
Sport begins with a 
game, an orderly zone 
marked off- often by 
white chalk lines- from 
the prevailing disorder 
The rules, for sure, are 
arbitrary at best Too 
often they arc a by- 
product of the lords 
who run the big busi- 
ness of tbe games. 
However, tbey are by design essential. 

Under close examination it is true 
dial all sports are dumb. The object of 
m;iiiy games is simple yet quiic com- 
plex. In baseball one tries to smack a 
round leather orb with a wooden stick. 
Basketball pits two teams of five play- 
ers attempting lo throw an orange ball 
through a suspended metal hole. 
Bowling, a very old game, is an individ- 
ual effort of man against plastic pins. 
Then, there is golf. Grown men 
strolling the countryside swat- 
ting at a small white ball and 
trymg lo get it to fall into a hole 
some 300 to 500 yards away 
The games are dumb lo Ik 



sure. The beauty of it aJI Ls that by play- 
ing or watching we are able to forget 
about the stupidity of the games and 
concentrate on the ultimate goal, being 
the best. 

Being the best brings up the central 
criticism by those who oppose sports. 
Darwinisis would contend thai sports is 
simply a competition for the attraction 
of the opposite sex. Freudians might say 
that it IS man playing with his most 
priced possessions. FeminisLs no doubt 
point to the machoism of sports, and 
physicians might blame testosterone for 
the populiirity of sports. Tlirough it all 
there is no denying that sports serves 
the human needs of participants and 
spectators alike. 

Sports thrives on the lore of its 
games Many times it is all that a father 
is able to pass on to his son 
Generations and generations have bond- 
ed on the simple grounds of American 
sport lore. 

Games and contests have become a 
way of life in American society. It has 



become a mano-y-mano conversation 
between lathers and sons, mothers and 
daughters and all combinations thereof. 
Spons teaches lessons of mortality and 
immortality. It is said that sports is life, 
the rest is just the details 

Everything about life is sports. 
Whether it is a contest for the best job 
in town or the best team in the world of 
basket weaving, there is an essence of 
sports in all of society. So in reality 
there can be no one who is able to hon- 
estly say that be or she is not a sporis 
fan. Uttering such nonsense only points 
to the fact that there is an underlying 
need to compete and win in each one of 
us. Denying that fact only complicates 
life for those who wish things were not 
as they are in life. 

Take it as you will, just remember 
that behind every initiative ami L'vcry 
accomplishment is j 
game or sport that in 
essence defines who 
you are and where you 
rank in life
