Undergraduate honors 



Fischer selected for conference 



Janice Fischer has been selected to 
participate in the DePauw University 
National Undergraduate Honors Con- 
ference. The IPFW senior is only the 
third IPFW student to be selected. She 
was invited to attend the conference 
after submitting a research paper for 



Jo Switzer, assistant professor of 
communication and the professor who 
chose Fischer's paper, felt it would be 
a good candidate lor this year's con- 
ference. The paper, titled "Com- 
municative Characteristics and 
Functions of the Sibling Dyad," is 
atKiul the special relationship between 
two siblings. According to the report, 
siblings often remain together not just 



by chance but by choice. Siblings help 
each other develop a sense of self- 
concept; an older sibling may serve as 
a model for a younger one. 

Relationships between siblings arc 
complementary because "each 
person's behavior complements the 
other's," says the report. Parents 
often rely on other siblings to trans- 
late the meaning of another's silence

^Nuked chicken '? 

Dietitian discusses athlete^s meals 



National nutrition month came to 
IPFW in the person of Jackie Berning, 

Berning, a registered dietitian, is 
currently the nutritional consultant for 
the Denver Broncos and the U.S. 
Olympic Swim Team. Berning came 
to Fort Wayne at the invitation of 
Edwina Snyder, assistant professor of 
consumer ,Tnd f.imily sciences. 




Jackie Berning 

During her guest lecture, given to 
Snyder's classes last Thursday, Bern- 
ing shared her knowledge of sports' 
nutrition. 

Berning said one common myth is 



that a high-protein, low-carbohydrate 
diet is the way to add muscle mass. 
She told the story of a Broncos' pros- 
pect whose favorite meal was "nuked 
chicken." 

"I asked him what he meant by 
'nuked chicken'. He said he put ten 
chicken breasts in the microwave and 
had them for breakfast, lunch and 
dinner," Berning explained. 

Berning said the prospect could not 
last more than half an hour in the 
weight room. The athlete improved 
after being put on a diet higher in 
carbohydrates. "Carbohydrates are 
the preferred source of fuel for muscle 
growth," Berning said. 

Even so, Berning was skeptical of 
sports drinks that purport to 
add cartwhydrates to the body. "It it's 
liquid, that's telling me that it has got 
to be simple carbohydrates," Berning 
said. According to Berning, simple 
carbohydrates are inferior to complex 
carbohydrates, which she said were 
found in breads and cereals. 

"Breakfast is the easiest way to put 
carbohydrates into the body. With the 
Broncos we stress the importance of 
breakfast," 

One student asked why athletes eat 
so much junk food during competition, 

"Let me give you this dilemma," 
Berning said, "Suppose you calculate 



that your athlete needs 8,000 calories a 
day. How are you going to put 8,000 
calories into an athlete when they 
have to compete all day? You would 
want to choose from the four basic 
food groups, but your athlete is too 
busy to eat all that. That's when you 
feed your athlete candy bars." 



"The typical person believes 
if a little is good, then more 
is better. It doesn 't work that 
way with nutrition 



Jackts B«mlng 

regisieted dietman 



Berning questioned the effectiveness 
of large doses of vitamin C in pre- 
venting colds. "There is no scientific 
evidence supporting the idea thai 
megadosing vitamin C will prevent a 
cold. In fact, there is some evidence 
suggesting that megadosing vitamin C 
causes kidney stones I'm more 
worried about kidney stones than 
catching a cold," Berning said. 

"The typical person believes if a 
little is good, then more is better. It 
doesn't work that way with nutrition," 
Berning said. 



Police and Safety 

Severe weather shelter available 



By LILLIAN R. LYON 
Edllor-in-Chiof 

Severe thunderstorms and tornadoes 
are a hazard of spring in Indiana, and 
with warmer temperatures comes the 
threat of bad weather. 

IPFW Police and Safety conUnu- 
ously monitors NCAA weather radio, 
according to Sergeant Daniel 
Matthews, in addition to all local 
police traffic, when threatening 
weather is imminent. When the Na- 
tional Weather Service issues a 
tornado warning, Police and Safety 
will activate the tornado alarm, which 
sounds in a series of short blasts in all 
campus buildings. 

A tornado warning. Matthews says, 
means a tornado has been sighted and 
poses an immediate threat. Persons 



who spot a tornado or funnel cloud 
while on the IPFW campus should 
immediately notify Police and Safety 
at 481-6827. 

When a warning is issued, people 
have only minutes to react. Matthews 
advises them to cease all imiversity 
activities and go to the nearest 
designated shelter. 

Shelters are: the basements of the 
Classroom-Medical Building, the 
Helmke Library, the Athletic Center 
or Neff Hall; the basement or 
auditorium of the main building in the 
downtown fine arts complex; the 
basement or ground floor of the south 
wing or east wing of Kettler Hall; 
rooms lllA or tllB of the Life 
Sciences Building; and the ground 



floor hallways and recreational areas 
of the Walb Memorial Union. 

Matthews also advises people to 
remain in the shelter during an 
emergency situation until a police 
officer or a uniformed imiversity 
employee gives the all-clear. 

Matthews reminds students, faculty 
and staff not to use the elevators if an 
alarm sounds, since there is the 
danger of being trapped in the ele- 
vator if power is lost. Matthews asks 
that the stairways be used and that 
aid be given to those confined to 
wheelchairs or using crutches. 

For further advice or information, 
contact Matthews in the department of 
Police and Safety. 



or non-verbal gesliu'e, 

A significant aspect of Janice's 
paper is how it answers a question 
that is often asked: How can two slb- 
hngs, reared by the same parents and 
in the same environment, grow up to 
be totally different from each other? 

The answers lies in the "sibling 
dyad," In which eoch sibling creates a 
unique environment for the other. The 
way two siblings act toward each 
other causes them to develop differ- 
ently, A sort of "environment within 
an environment" forms and causes 
the difference, the report states, 

At the conference, Fischer will work 
with a nationally-recognized scholar. 
Theodore Clevenger, a professor from 
Florida State University. Tliey will 
discuss her paper and further methods 
of research. 

Upon completion of her studies at 
IPFW, Fischer would like to enter 
public relations. She is interested in 
working for a health organization such 
as the Red Cross. 

Both Students' Government and the 
department of communication under- 
wrote Fischer's participation in the 
conference. 



New degree 
offered by 
department 



The audiotogy and speech sciences 
department is now offering a bache- 
lor's degree in speech and hearing 
therapy. 

Previously, students interested in 
speech and audiology would start on 
their bachelor's degrees and then 
transfer to Purdue University to 
complete them. 

For a number of years, the audi- 
ology and speech sciences department 
has had the program in effect and had 
the authority to offer the degree, but it 
was unable to because of the lack of 
staff 

Pauline Flynn, professor and de- 
partment chair of the audiology and 
speech sciences department, stressed 
that curriculum offered at IPFW 
should no longer be considered a 
transfer program to West Lafayette. 
She hopes the image of a "transfer 
program" is erased so more students 
will be encouraged to enroll and take 
advantage of the full-degree program 
offered here at IPFW, 

One new full-time professor, two 
associate faculty and a speech-and- 
hearing clinic have allowed the de- 
partment to expand the program and 
offer the bachelor's degree. 

The department is supported by 
many businesses and organizations 
through contributions and scholar- 
ships, which in part have brought 
about this departmental expansion. 
The Psi Iota Psi sorority has con- 
tributed to the department's growth 
by providing money for positions, 
clinical materials and scholarships. 

The Sertoma organizations have 
also been twneficial to the department 
by offering money for various de- 
partmental needs. The downtown 
Sertoma club, in memory of William 
Doctor, its founder, is sponsoring a 
$500 scholarship for a qualifying 
student entering IPFW. Students have 
until April 8 to register for the 
scholarship, which is to t&gt;e used during 
the fall of 1988 and spring 1989 school 
year. 

Dr. Flynn beUeves the goat of audi- 
ology and speech is to help eliminate 
and reduce disorders which impair 
communication. He said, "To com- 
municate effectively is what a quality 
life is all about. 

To draw attention to the degree, the 
audiology and speech sciences de- 
partment is having an open house for 
those students interested in a career 
of helping people communicate. Those 
wishing to attend should register by 
calling 481-6410. The last session will 
be Monday at 8:30 a.m. 

For further information about the 
open house, enrolling in the depart- 
ment or applying for the scholarship,

sciences department.

The Communicator 



T&gt;iurKby, March 24. 19S8 



Constitution: 

Election code has flaws 



Kurt Gregory is no exception to 
the rule: every student boay pres- 
ident has difficulty appointing an 
election board. Ttiis is no excuse; 
Gregory, having campaigned so 
vigorously on the topic last spring, 
should have known what was 
coming. 

Still, the fact that the election- 
board drama plays itself out every 
year indicates that the problem lies 
deeper than within one individual. 
Once again, Students' Government 
finds itself stabbed in the back by 
its own constitution. 

The rules for elections, found in 
the bylaws, state that election- 
board members can neither run nor 
hold office in Students' Govern- 
ment. So who would want to serve 
on the election board? Senators in- 
terested in Students' Government 
would avoid the board because 
serving on it would mean an end to 
their government careers. And, of 
; course, those who do not care about 
[ Students' Government would not 
[ have anything to do with the board 
• In the first place, 

; Why is the board run this way? 
; Apparently the constitution's au- 
1 thors thought having an electoral 
'■ board composed of outsiders would 
; guarantee that the election would 
i not be rigged in favor of the 
; incumbents. 

But the document fails to do even 
■ that. The constitution says the 
president shall submit nominations, 
from which the senate would 
: choose five board members. The 
' document's designers apparently 
: envisioned the senate having a 
wide range of choices. What hap- 
' pens, in practice, is that the presi- 
dent scrounges to find five names, 
which the senate, exhausted by 
; missed deadlines, wearily accepts. 
Thus the election board is made up 
of presidential appointees virtually 
j unchallenged by the senate. 



The solution is to make running 
the election for senators and pres- 
ident a responsibility of the Student 
Activities Board. Senators could 
repay the favor by running the SAB 
elections. These boards would be no 
more biased than the present 
boards, and they would be far eas- 
ier to assemble. 

The election code has other 
flaws. Under the code, candidates 
must spend under $100 on their 
campaign and submit financial re- 
ports on their expenditures before 
the polls close. No doubt this law 
was based on spending limitations 
imposed in national campaigns. 

But even if campaign-spending 
limitations are a good idea nation- 
ally, they are a lousy idea at 
IPFW. Students' Government is 
invisible, and spending money on 
handbills and posters is the only 
way candidates can uncloak them- 
selves from obscurity. 

The code also leaves the question 
of enforcement unanswered. Should 
a candidate forfeit the presidency 
because that candidate spent too 
much on the election? This provi- 
sion should be discarded as unen- 
forceable and undesirable. 

The provision that limits cam- 
paigning to the week before the 
election should also be discarded. 
One week is insufficient time for 
candidates to engage in meaningful 
debate. One week is too short a 
time for candidates to become 
known to voters. One week means 
that the issues can be discussed in 
only one issue of The Commu- 
nicator. One week also means that 
candidates can hurl irresponsible 
charges at each other, knowing 
that one week is too short a time 
for rebuttals. 

With these changes, the drama of 
a Students' Government election 
would not be the rules but the elec- 
tion itself.

In response to the letter 
written in the March 3 issue 
of "The Communicator" 
about this student's parking 
problem: I'm afraid I do 
not entirely understand the 
author's point. You seem to 
be taking this the wrong 
way. 

The purpose of lines in a 
parking lot is to assure neat

seem to believe- in the

give us a place to leave our

The Communicator 



IPFW art school provides hope 



By SARA SEIBERT 
Staff Writer 



"Give me any student off 
the street who has enough 




interest, and I will teach 
that person to draw,"' That 
is the feeling of Leslie Motz, 
assistant chairman of the 
fine arts department. 

The Fort Wayne School 
and Museum is located at 
1026 West Berry St, The 
building was willed to In- 
diana University; it was 
formally organized by 
Theodore Theime in 1922. It 
was the wish of Theime that 
revenue of any kind coming 
from the fine arts school be 
put back into the school for 
future use. This assured 
Theime that the school 
would be taken care of. The 
school is now sponsored by 
the university, scholarships 
and private gifts. 



Problem Corner 



Problem No. 10. Two 
men are walking toward 
each other alongside a 
railway, A freight train 
overtakes one of them, 
and it takes sixty-four 
seconds to pass him Ex- 
actly twelve minutes after 
that, the train meets the 
other man, and it passes 
him in fifty-seven seconds. 
How long after the train 
has passed the sev:ond 
man will the two men 
meet? (Assume constant 
speeds throughout.) 

Send or take solutions 
by Thursday, March 31, to 
Problem Corner, room 285 
or 283, Kettler Hall, Copies 



of the problem are also 
available there. 

The mathematical de- 
partment will publish a 
problem each week. The 
names of those who 
submit correct solutions 
will be published. Prizes 
will be awarded to the 
undergraduate solvers 
with the t)est record for 
the semester. Both quahly 
and quantity count, 

A solution to Problem 8 
is posted in a display case 
outside the math depart- 
ment. It was solved by 
Jeff Kacines and Mark 
Harbor, 



"/ think of my 
students not as stu- 
dents but as family. 
The student body 
becomes almost like 
a family. " 

Leslie Motz 

assistant chairmen 
tine erts department 



The School of Fine Arts 
requires the basic academic 
program and the foundation 
program, which consists of 
drawing fundamentals, 
painting fundamentals, fig- 
ure drawing, design fun- 
damentals, lettering and 
principles of graphic de- 
sign. Each student is re- 
quired to complete one year 
of studio work at IPFW, 
and some may be required 
to submit a portfolio during 



the second year of classes 

Motz describes his dedi- 
cation as a sense of love for 
art and a closeness to those 
who work at and attend the 
school, "You should love art 
and want lo do it Find out 
what the possibilities are,'" 
explained Motz. He says 
there is a sense of family 
between the students and 
the teachers Motz greets 
each student he sees by 
name. He said, "I think of 
my students not as students 
but as family. The student 
body becomes almost like 
family." Motz feels tliat this 
sense of student-teacher in- 
' teraction draws the stu- 
dents to the school, 

Motz feels that if a stu- 
dent is determined and in- 
terested, he will go far. He 
said, "If you like art, then 
by all means, give it every- 
thing you have, and if you 
don't, then get the hell 
out!"

Mastodons have banner season 



By MIKE LINVILLE 
Sports Editor 

What a difference a year 
makes! After two consecu- 
tive losing seasons and two 
last-place finishes in the 
Great Lakes Valley Con- 
ference, the IPFW men's 
basketball leam turned in a 
15-13 record and a fourth- 
place finish in the GLVC in 
1987-88. 

The winning record and 
first-division finish for the 
Mastodons is even more 
amazing due to the fact that 
a number of the 'Dons were 
out with injuries during the 
course of the season. 

Much of the credit tor the 
revjtalization of the men's 
program can be attributed 
to first-year coach Andy 
Piazza. Piazza brought a 
winning record with him 
from Delta Community 
College and a group of 
players who would join the 
returning Dons in turning 
the program around. 

"Two years before, IPFW 
was 8-20 and 3-13 in the 
conference, and last year it 
was 9-19 and again 3-13 in 
the conference. And last fall 



at the conference preseason 
meetings, the coaches' poll 
put us in last place in the 
conference standings," said 
Piazza. 

"We Tmished 8-8 in the 
conference. Eight wins is 
the most ever by IPFW in 
the GLVC, and fourth place 
is the highest we have ever 
finished. Our 15-13 record 
was the first winning season 
in three years here," he 
added. 

The Great Ukes Valley 
Conference was one of the 
premier Division U basket- 
ball leagues this past 
season. 

"The NCAA Division II 
Tournament only has 32 
teams, and the top three 
from our conference all got 
NCAA bids." said the 
coach. 

Kentucky Wesley an Col- 
lege. Lewis University and 
Ashland College were all 
invited to the tournament. 

"Ashland had 18 wins and 
got in; we were only three 
wins away from an NCAA 
Tourney bid," said Piazza. 

This year's squad was 
dominated by under- 



classmen, by season's end 
it only sported one senior, 
center-forward Richard Ivy. 
Ivy averaged 12.1 points per 
game while shooting 56 
percent from the field and 
81 percent from the charity 
stripe. Ivy was among the 
conference leaders in Ijoth 
field goals and free-throw 
percentage. The 6-foot-3- 
inch forward was also 
Great Lakes Player of the 
Week once and scored over 
1,000 points in his Mastodon 
career. Ivy averaged 5.6 
rebounds a game. 

The core of this year's 
team was juniors Bruce 
Roland and Steve Bard and 
sophomore Lawrence 
"Biggs" Jordan. The trio 
came to be known as "the 
Killer B's." 

Roland led the team and 
the GLVC in scoring with 
an average of 24 points per 
game. Those $72 points are 
the most by a Mastodon in 
one seasoji. The 6-foot-3- 
inch forward captured the 
Great Lakes Player of the 
week award four times 
during the season. He a|so 
captured past season honors 



Lady 'Dons look to future 



By MIKE LINVILLE 

Sports Editor 

II was a long basketball 
season for the IPFW Lady 
'Dons; the team only won 
five of 26 contests and 
finished last in the Great 
Lakes Valley Conlerence ■ 
with a record of 2-14. 

But first-year coach Teri 
Rosinski still saw some - 
good things come out of the 
1987-88 season. 

"Overall I'm fairly 
pleased," said the coach. 
"It was definitely a growing 
and learning experience, 
and as long as we keep 
working at l&gt;eing successful 
and focus on the future, 
we'll be fine." 

Experience, or lack of it, 
hurt the Lady 'Dons from 
the start as they began the 
season without a single 
upperclassman and a 10- 
person rostei' that cArisIste'ti' 
of four sophomores and six 



freshmen. The 'Dons faced 
a very competitive sched- 
ule, which included many 
senior-dominated teams and 
four GLVC clubs that won 
20 or more games this 
season. 

The Lady 'Dons did have 
some outstanding individual 
performances. Freshman 
Sarah Turner captured the 
Great Lakes Valley Con- 
ference Player of the week 
honor early in the season. 
The 6-root-lall center was 
second on the IPFW team 
in scoring, with an average 
of 15.6 a game. That^total 
also placed her ninth on the 
GLVC scoring list. Turner 
shot 56 percent from the 
field and led the 'Dons in 
rebounds with an average 
of 7.2, good enough to make 
them tenth in the 
conference. 

Robin Scott led the 'Dons 



m sconng, averaging 15.8 
points a game and earning 
eighth place in the GLVC. 
Nancy Townsend was 
among the conference 
leaders in assists, with 108, 
for an average of 4.3 and 
eighth place in the 
conference. 

Teen a Merrell averaged 
14.6 points a game this sea- 
son for the 'Dons and now 
has 737 career points; she is 
in the third position on the 
Lady 'Dons' all-time scor- 
ing list. The 5-foot-lo-inch 
sophomore forward has 312 
rebounds for her career and 
is in the number five spot 
on the all-time list. 

"I was pleased toward the 
end of the season by the in- 
tensity and hard work we 
displayed, I'm very positive 
about the future, and I feel 
we can.tprn.lhio^^j^roun^ 
and win." summed" u^ 
Rosinski. 



by being named to the first 
teams of both the Great 
Lakes Valley All-Con- 
ference team and the Great 
Lakes NABC All-Region 
leam Roland was in 
seventh place in the con- 
ference in rebounding with 
an average of 7.2. 

Bard, who came down 
from Delta Community 
College with Piazza, placed 
third in the GLVC, scoring 
an average of 20,2 a game. 
Bard's 506 points is the 
third highest total by a 
member of the IPFW team 
in one season. The 5-foot-lO- 
inch guard was second in 
the conference in free-throw 
percentage and tenth in 
three-point field goal 
percentage. 

Jordan sel new IPFW 
season and career records 
for assists in regular play 
and in a GLVC game. The 
5-foot-8-inch guard finished 
with 260 assists on the sea- 
son for an average of 9.2. 
The single-game record for 
assists, held by Jordan, is 
17, 

The stats bear out the 
improvement of this year's 
team over last year's 
squad. In 1986-87 the 
Mastodons averaged 74 
points a game, while shoot- 
ing only 46 percent from the 
floor. This year's edition hit 
on 51 percent of their shots 
and averaged 84 points per 
game. 

"I'm really optimistic 
about the future, I feel that 
everything is in place, and 
we have outstanding 
players returning.," said 
Piazza.
