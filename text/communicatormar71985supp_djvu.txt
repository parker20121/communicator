Spring Summer Winla-

change your whole ward- 
robe. They are also Ihe 
basis of color consulting, one 
of Ihe mint sought after 
services in Ihe fashion in- 

TIk seasonal approach to 
color consulting began In 
California In the early iMOs. 
According to Dodl 
Aeschllman. owner of Colors 
for Life, the concept was 
developed by Suianne 
C^gyhlll. a San Francisco 
consultant, so each season 
represents a collection of 
colon suited to a person's 



ttian just vintage fashions. 
And wiih both men's and 
women's clnlhlng equally 
represented, variety Is in- 
creased. According to 



impteteloch. 

"Many young women," 
Smith said, "shop In tlic 
men's department for tldngi 
like big shirts or overcoili." 

The setse of regret from 



Fanny Brice might have 
lamented hand-me-dowis, 
but today's fashton- 
coRsclDus public seems to t&gt;c 
enjoying them Immensely.

Many consultants use a 
"pre-packaged " approach to 

eomca to Aeschllman. she 
goes through a collection ol 
over I20O color samples to 
deterndne what colors will 
look best. This individual 
color system Is different 
from the method ksed by the 
"pre-packaged" color 
consultants, Aeschllman 
said her melhod gives a 
much more complete Idea ti 
what colore look best than 
the 120 or so colors med b}/ 
the "pre-packaged" groups, 
because two people could be 

the same paUette of colors. 

As a genemt rule, tbe 
sea sens are ca leg niied: 

— Sprlnp lend to have

colors. 

Using these colon as a 
guide, Aeschllman creates a

hundreds of fabric swatches 
she has In her studio She 
uses tticse to advise clients 
on tenturt, style and pattern 
choices In addition to the 
color selection. 

Once these cbolces have
