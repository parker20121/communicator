IPFW often boasts of its wide 
variety of degrees available. As 
seen on ads around campus and in 
town, there are more 175 programs 
that can be studied. But through 
how many of these can a student 
earn a four-year degree? 

Surprisingly, of the estimated 
175 undergraduate programs, only 
50 of them offer the possibility of a 
Bachelor's degree. 

When asked about this gap. 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Edna Neal says that even though 
there are 175 available, that does 
not mean all of them offer a degree. 

"Programs may be different 
from a major. Some other options 
include minors, associates degrees, 
certificates and transfer programs," 
Neal said. 

She's right. Of the 165 under- 
graduate programs, 50 of them are 
Bachelor degrees, 34 are Associates 
degrees, 41 are Minor degrees, 27 
are certificate programs, and 17 are 
transfer programs. 

According to Neal, certificate 
programs are a way to specialize 
education in a specific field. 
Certificates also look good on 
resumes for students applying for

Children's 
Pow Wow

Both past and future were cen-

Children's Pow-Wow in the Walb 
Union Ballroom. 

The gathering, presented by the 
United Native American Student 
Organization (UNAS) brought 
together different tribal groups to 
form an intertribal Pow-Wow, 
focused on children. The two-day 
event was attended by about 41)0

told the dancers are "showing

Homecoming 



different \ 



s this week. 

The rest of this week features 
days like Western Day 
(Wednesday), Mardi Gras Day 
(Thursday) and Blue and White 
Spirit Day on Friday. Student 
Activities Board's Erin McConaha 
is thrilled with the reaction to 
Homecoming 2003 thus far, and is 
hoping for large crowds for 
upcoming events. 

"I'm hoping that the Pep Rally 
and Tailgating are pretty big. 
We've never done it before," she 
said. 

The campus' third 

Homecoming Bonfire is set for 
Thursday night in the parking lot 
of Williams Theatre. 

Of course, the major event is 
the Friday arrival of college sports 
legend Dick Vitale. Vitale will be 
on hand to sign his new book, and 
give students some pre-game 
warm up chatter at the Pep Rally 

A biography on Dicky V is 
located on page 11. 

The sense of school awareness 
is evident to student officials. 

"More people are getting

involved in it. It makes me feel 
pretty good, pretty excited," 
NkConaha said. 

Blue and White Day on Friday 
will probably feature a lot of peo- 
ple wearing school colors, she pre- 

"Everybody has an IPFW T- 
shirt they can throw on," for Blue 
and White Day, McConaha said. 

"The participation is amazing 
- it's starting to become a real cam- 
pus experience," Audrey Moore of 
Student Life said. The daily activi- 
ties are keeping people involved. 

"Every day there's something 
going on," Berry agreed. 

With Dick Vitale showing up 
for IPFW, it is another sign the 
campus continues to grow. Berry 
remembers seeing the school on an 
ESPN scroti for sports scores about 
a year ago. It was a feeling similar 
to a songwriter hearing their runes 
on the radio for a first time. 

"It doesn't seem like we're a 
Division I school, but we really

Walb Union Fireside Lounge rarely heated up 



It puts out so much heat 

that people get uncom- 
fortably warm in there. 
Blix Fredrick 
Walb Student Union 



By Aiden Bordner 

The Communicator 

On an average day, one can see a vari- 
ety of goings-on in Ihe main floor lounges of 
Walb Union: eating, watching television, 
and of course, sleeping. What you will no! 
likely see in the "Fireside Lounge," howev- 
er, is a fire. Although the lounge was named 
for a large fireplaci 
occupying a comer o 
the room, the hearth i 
almost never lit. 

Erin Curney, I 
former student win 
has been frequenting 
the union lounge fo 
almost three year, saic 
that she has only seen the fireplace lit once 
before, lh.it being when she lil i! herself two 
years ago. 

"It was the last storm of the season, and 
I got caught in it," Gurney said. Drenched, 
she says she managed lo light the natural 
gas-fueled log and used it to heat her 
clothes. "I jusl wrapped mysell in a blanket 
and sat there," she said. 

Trevor Allen, a junior a! IPFW and 
another regular of Ihe union lounge said 
that he has only one complaint about the 

"There's no fire," he said, complaining 
that -- in addition to Ihe lack of warmth - 
when the weather gets bad, the empty fire- 



place actually detracts from the com! 
level of Ihe room. 

"The doors rattle, it whistles rei 
loud ... it's hard to do anything in here v. 
that thing making Ihe noise it does," he s; 

There are, however, reasons for the li 
of a frequent fire in the lounge. 

"There's a problem," Student Un 
director Blix Fredrick said. "It's so big - 
it so much heal -- 1 



during Ihe construction of 
the building by the class of 
1974, required a lot of effort 
to light. 

"We had to go outside and turn the gas 
on at the meter," Fredrick said. A remote 
ignition unit has since been installed to 
make the process easier. 

Although infrequent, student union 
operations dues make use of the fireplace. 
"We do turn it on for some special recep- 
tions," Fredrick said, 

What many students who frequent Ihe 
lounge may not realize is that, should they 
want the fireplace lit, all they have to do is 

"They can come ask us to do it," 
Fredrick said. Requests to have the fireplace 

lit can be made at the Walb Union informa- 
tion desk during normal business hours.

Major situations 

from Page One 



um that is set for opening in 2005. 
With these expensive andtime-con- 
suming additions to the campus, 
some wonder why more emphasis 
isn't put on the education itself. 

Vice Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs Steve Sarratore promises if 
there are majors out there that 
should be present, then the neces- 
sary steps that need to be taken 
will be carried out. 

"Programs are always under 
review. There is always a way in 
which they can be better. They are 
constantly looking for ways in 
which the program can be 
improved, and who should be con- 
tacted for recommendations on 
what strategic direction should be 
taken," Sarratore said. 

In order for a new major to 
appear, a few steps must be cov- 
ered, Sarratore said. First is the 
talking stage. Next, a series of pro- 
posals would be made. It could 
take years, Sarratore said, before 
the major is officially introduced 
and available to the student body. 

Presently, there are existing 
bachelor programs that are being 
reviewed. 

Sarratore said that in recent 
meetings there have been discus- 
sions to offer a Masters in Special 
Education and Speech Cathology. 

Sarratore also said that at a 
recent meeting he attended it was 
announced that there would be a 



new major in Computer 
Engineering Technology. 

All possibilities of major are 
directed towards the Committee of 
Higher Education. This committee 
is a regional institution whose job 
is to "fill the 

need of a program in the Market 
place as well as fulfill the needs of 
the students" Sarratore said. 

If students feel a major should 
be introduced, Sarratore says, then 
they should have their voice heard. 

"A new program will be 
looked into if there is a need for it 
in the market and if it satisfactorily 
meets students needs," he said. 

There has been word of a 
dance major making an appear- 
ance but Sarratore said there hasn't 
been any paperwork about it. 

"Nothing has been written, 
but I have heard about it. Dance 
has been offered as a minor in the 
past, but there are things to 
remember. If a Dance major was 
offered, more than just the major 
would be needed for it to succeed. 
There would be need of space for 
it, like a new dance studio," he 



promise. 

for it, though."

* wf Classic Movie Review Series: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^s 

'Maltese Falcon' set standards for noir films, 
Bogart's non-acting paves path for Bond flicks 



It's every detective noir movie 
you've ever scene: The hard-bitten 
cynical detective meets a beautiful 
yet treacherous woman with a secret 
meet, and fall for each other. Along 
the way there is a foreign villain 
with a nickname like 'The Fat Man," 
a diminutive villainous sidekick, 
and the detective's friend in the 
police force. 

Yes, it is a cliche. But like any 
cliche, it had to start with 
thing. The 1941 Humphrey Bogart 
classic, "The Maltese Falcon," was, 
essentially, the first detective noir 
movie. It set the standard. 

Bogart brought Dashiell 
Hammett's character Sam Spade to 
life in the usual Bogart style. Let's 
face it, Bogart wasn't much of an 
actor. He played Humphrey Bogart 

Is this a bad thing? Definitely not. 
Bogart is a strong character who can 
get away with murder and still be a 
saint in the eyes of adoring fans. 
Sam Spade, that cynical detective 
we've heard so much about, is much 
like Bogey himself: wisecracking, 
misogynistic, with a strong sense of 
identity. 

At the beginning of the movie, Sam Spade's 
partner. Miles Archer (Jerome Cowan) is 
found murdered. He was close to discover- 
ing the whereabouts of a mysterious object: a 
gold jeweled falcon figurine covered in lac- 
Mary Astor plays opposite Bogart. Enter 
Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Astor's character), 
and quickly takes Spade through a fren2y of 
situations, until he meets Sydney 
Greenstreet as Kaspar Gutman, a.k.a. "The 
Fat Man", and Peter Lorre as Joel Cairo, 
another unsavory character looking for the

fact that Spade and his 
cohorts were 'shady charac- 
ters.'" This is where the 
classic Bogart woman- 
hating comes in. He is 
i develop a liking. We the only actor who could possibly get away 
in. Gutman is on the with treating woman badly, and still make 



herself by showing him 
that her "heart is in the 
right place," and the 



female fans swoon over him (with the 
possible exception of Sean Connery). 
He talks to Astor's character like she is 
a child, and slaps her around a bit when 
she is lying to him. At the risk of spoil- 
ing the end of the movie, he turns her in 
to the police and she still proclaims her 
love for the man. This man is amaz- 
ing — how does he get away with it? 
To make matters worse, the audience 
discovers that Sam Spade has been hav- 
ing an affair with Archer's wife before 
Archer died, and she loves him. Yet in 
the eyes of his audience, Bogart's char- 
acter is still a hero. 

This movie is great in that almost every 
element of its cloak-and-dagger plot has 
set the standard for noir movies lo 
iuch like Hammett's book, on 
which the movie was based, sel the tone 
for so many other detective novels. 
Much of it could have to do with the 
facf that the legendary director John 
Huston changed virtually nothing 
about the story — the movie is almost 
word-for-word with the novel at times, 
and scene sequence was not changed. 
The black-and-white shooting of 'The 
Maltese Falcon" played experimentally 
with light — they used darkness and 
shadows to enforce the fact that Spade 
and his cohorts were "shady charac- 
ters." Huston, who directed other 
jvies such as "The African 
d "Key Largo," mastered the 
noir flow, and created an element of doubt in 
the minds of an audience, over a character's 
real intentions. No one, while watching 
"Maltese Falcon" for the first time knows if 
O'Shaughnessy is really a good girl or a bad 
girl. By the end, there is still a trace of ambi- 
guity. This is the beauty of the film. 

The Maltese Falcon is the movie that set 
the pace for all further "Whodunit?" movies. 
Humphrey Bogart is the man who led it to 
greatness. He, with a long and brooding face, 
was the first to carry the tortured hero from 
one deception- la den setting to the next, and 
still defeat the bad guy and win the girl in 
the end.

Editorial 

A Homecoming of sorts 

For generations, communities celebrated "Homecomings" during the summer 
time. It was a time when county fairs would take place to entice family members from 
surrounding areas into the county seat or larger town to get to know one-another 
again. 

Through the generations, the tradition has slowly faded in meaning and popular- 
ity. With the faster ability to travel and easier ability to communicate, being with 
friends and family isn't a challenge nor a yearly event longed for - let's face it, some- 
times it 's just the opposite. 

Sometimes, it's a nice thought to consider that awkward relative living on the far 
side of a river, 100 miles a way, with just a mule to travel by and carrier pigeons to 
send out advice about love, career choices and sports teams. 

lint it 's not where we are in our generation. We have instant communication and 
pretty quick transportation if we want it. Some of us decide to go the way of Ted 
Kaczynski - just minus the fetish for bomb making, hopefully. And some of us go the 
way of Cling-Wrap. 

During the next two weeks, the campus will be celebrating Homecoming - a col- 
lege tradition began decades ago by other schools, but started here in 2001; and the 
country will celebrate Thanksgiving, a time wlien friends and family gather for at 
least one day when we try to appreciate what our blessings in life really are. 

Athletics always play a prominent role in university homecomings, but it is also 
important to note that it is not strictly for the team on the floor ~ it is for a time of 
celebration for the students in the stands as well. A time of unity and a chance to 
learn about each other once again, no matter what our background is or where our 
futures wilt take us, this time is ours' to do with what is best. 

Letters to the editor 

'Statements of idiocy' 

Talk about statements of idiocy, The Communicator stepped right into it with their 
editorial last week. To quote the editorial "The next time a conservative complains about the 
liber.il media, it will be a statement of idiocy", referring to CBS moving the movie about 
Ronald Reagan to their sister company 'Showtime' because of threatened boycotts of the 
advertisers. As 1 recall liberals, 'hissyfitting like fourth graders' and 'flexing their muscle', 
forced the hand of one of the major TV networks to pull the Dr, Laura TV talk show off the 
airwaves not too long ago, 

Heellooo liberals . . . muscle flexing and hissyfitting works both ways. Networks ARE 
commercially driven (a fact not up for debate). If they find that they cannot sell advertising, 
or in the case of Dr. Laura found the advertisers were boycotted, they tend to drop that pro- 
gramming in deference to the advertising revenue, duh!. 

It is unfortunate that the Ronald Reagan program will not air on the regular network 
for conservatives to actually boycott the advertisers, but CBS figured out before airing the left 
leaning program that it was going to be a bust with the advertisers. In other words, CBS 
'LEARNED' from the Dr. Laura fiasco to cut and run, Business is business, 

You can thank your liberal friends for opening up CBS's 'eye'. Conservatives were just 
doing what they saw the liberals do, threaten boycott (hissyfitting if you insist). I guess if lib- 
erals complain (hissyfit and muscle flex) about network content and get programming pulled 
that's reason for celebration, but if conservatives complain (hissyfit and muscle flex) about 
network content that's idiocy Go figure. Remember this is a free society with freedom of 
speech. We may not like everyone's expression of that speech but we are free to express it and 
commercial business bends to what sells. The semi-fictionalized Reagan program is still 
going to air, just not on a COMMERCIAL network.

Recognize the Vets 

On a week where everyone is transfixed on Brittany Spears 
and if she is "innocent" or not and where the question seems to be 
is Rosie O'Donnell a publishing dictator or not, we have lost sight 
ofivhat is really important. This week's lead story should be the 
recognition of veterans of war. 

For four days AMC has been running war movies 
stop. 1 have never particularly been a war movie watcher. While 

true, that some of the movies take dramatic license in what 
being portrayed; other movies are based on fact. I must have 
watched several Pearl Harbor based films and they all seemed 
sistent with the facts. Despite the threat of attack, ive wen 
nunicating the way we should have been in order to pre 
the devastation of the Pearl Harbor attack by the Japanese on that 
fateful day. Many lives were lost there and in other conflicts, too. 
One movie not in the AMC group is The Best Years ofOw 
lives. This movie deals with the aftermath of war, how soldiers art 
welcomed or rejected as they return from the war front. Issues art 
presented within their families, their friends and their home towns 
by the fact that they had not changed due to the war. Only those 
tluit served in the war were changed by their experiences and, ; 
often than not, are bad mementos for their heroic service to their 
country. 

I am sure we all have a relative or tivo who have served 
country. My father served in the Korean conflict. My step-father 
s even a prisoner of war (POW) in Korea. My husband st 
Vietnam. We should all be proud of their service to our country 
and recognize them proudly in defending their united cause of lib- 
erty for all World War ), World War.il,, the Korean War, the 
mm War, Desert Storm and the present war with Iraq. Many 
liave served and many are presently seroing. 

Let's give "the boys" who previously served (and are cur- 
ily serving) credit where credit is long overdue. Thank youfoi 
your strength. Thank you for your service. Tliank you for protect- 
is and our freedom. God bless you all!

Mandie-tory attendance: Are we still high school?

As I sit in my class, staring

the same thing that we've all 
thought at one time or another. 

"Why do I have to be 

As many of us have experi- 
e time or another, some- 
times completing our majors 
means starting at the very begin- 
ning. Introductory courses are the 
norm for at least our first year and 
for someone that has taken AP 
courses in high school, sitting in a 
classroom listening to a lecture on 
sentence structure seems highly 
redundant. This is far from an 
uncommon problem. Sit in on 
your average 100 level class and

won't succeed, will goof off, will 
fall asleep in class and will, in the 
long run, leave school. Isn't it bet- 
ter to have the dedicated students 
in a disruption-free and positive 
learning environment than to have 
90 percent of your classroom dis- 
rupted by the 10 percent that really 
could care less? 

The typical student here at 
IPFW lives a very hectic and busy 
life. To force them to attend a lec- 
ture in an intro class where they 
can print off the exact lecture notes 
from WebCt, takes away not only 
their time to rest, but their time to 
study and to be productive. For 
those students not living in town, 
or even more so, a mile away, it's 
hard to convince themselves to 
attend their one fifty minute class 
for the day and be forced to watch 
a movie for a week straight. To 
drive 40 miles round trip for noth- 
ing is absurd. 

They should give me back 
some of my tuition money to fill up 
my gas tank, so I can afford to 
attend this "required educational 
experience". I know a number of 
fellow students whose day is 
packed from wake-up to tuck-in. 

They go from class imme- 
diately to work, from work imme- 
diately to study, and from study 
immediately to sleep, where the 



cycle is repeated the next day. This 
extra hour and forty-five minutes 
could give them a head start on 
that night's homework so they 
could get to bed sometime before 
4am. The extra time could be spent 
with loved ones or even healthier 
yet, sleeping. 

Shouldn't it be up to these 
grown men and women to find the 
responsibility within themselves to 
remember quiz days and to actual- 
ly dedicate themselves to studying 
the notes they missed in class? 
They don't require that their lives 
be spoon-fed to them, and if there 
are students that do, is it best to 
spoon-feed them for the four years 
they are here at school, and then 
drop them head-first into the real 
world? 

It's a matter of sink or 
swim and why put off this lesson of 
life until someone is in their mid- 
20s and holding their spoon-fed 
degree in their hand? 

Unfortunately for those 
responsible among us that can han- 
dle living their life, without it being 
handed to us, we'll be left staring at 
the ceiling, catching up on our 
reading, talking with our friends, 
and sneaking in a few Z's while 
we're being re-taught our four 
years of high school. 



Rentfrow's arguments far from thought-provoking 



By David Hunter 

Special to The Communicator 

I am responding to Justin 
Rentfrow's article "All apologies..." 
When I was a first-year student 
here, I took a philosophy course on 
a whim. In that beginning of that 
course, my professor said some- 
thing along the lines of "an unedu- 
cated and unsupported opinion 
doesn't amount to a hill of beans." 
Both of Mr. Rentfrow's articles con- 
cerning gays and pagans are uned- 
ucated and unsupported. Merely 
offering an "average Joe" opinion 
isn't worth anything in a forum 
where we assume the writer actual- 
ly has an idea of what he's talking 

Now, briefly I'll explain 
why my opinion might be worth a 
hill of beans, or something, any- 
way. I am a gay man, and I have 
been involved in the gay communi- 
ty for four years. At one point I ran 
United Sexualities (now EREN), 
I've run a gay youth organization, 
and I have the ability to form 
coherent arguments — well, you'll 
just have to judge that last one for 
yourself. Here are some observa- 
tions and criticisms I have about 
Mr. Rentfrow's articles. 

Addressing some of his 
argument concerning gays, accord- 
ing to Mr. Rentfrow, gays should 
not be open about their sexuality in 
public. We should only be gay in 
the privacy of our own homes. I'm 
not sure exactly what that means — 
should we not talk about it? 
Should we not express public affec- 
tion while our straight counter- 
parts openly kiss in front of us? 
Should I try to "pray out the gay" 
every time I leave my apartment? 

Mr. Rentfrow says that he 
is offended because gays are 
"parading" their sexuality and 
yelling about it with a bullhorn. He 
and I should meet, albeit under 
nicer circumstances. I don't appear 
to be gay. The only way someone 
will ever know that I am gay is if I 
tell them— and I will. I'm not 
ashamed of myself, and while I 
may not be apparently gay, if 
someone inquires about something 
that would lead to information 
about my sexual orientation, such 
as "do you have a girlfriend," or 
"don't you think she's hot, dude?" 
then I will provide such informa- 
tion. I won't lie just because they 
might be uncomfortable with it; I 
won't hide something about myself

Mr. Rentfrow does have a 
point (No, really, I'm serious here. 
Really!) when he says that being 
gay is only a part of a person. 
When 1 get up in the morning and 
wonder what I'm going to have for 
breakfast, I don't ask, "what's the 
gayest breakfast I could have (a 
cigarette and a cosmopolitan)?" or, 
"I'll take the gay route to work this 
morning." Some people do take a 
minority feature in themselves and 
make it what they are for the rest of 
their life. Most people only fixate 
on it for a while, since it's new and 
exciting, and they're proud to have 
accepted being different. 
Eventually they delegate being gay 
to a part of themselves, unless it 
continually conflicts with their life, 
like if they were married or closet- 
ed. However, being gay will 
always be a big part of a person's 
life. It affects their choice in decid- 
ing where to live, where to work, 
and many other things. When mak- 
ing a decision, you always have to 
ask the question "how will others 
perceive me if they discover I am 
gay?" I've had friends, for instance, 
who were denied housing because 
they were discovered to be more 
than just roommates. So, being gay 
is not just a difference in eye color, 
ifs a unique trait that can affect all 
parts of life because you never 
know how another person will per- 

Mr. Rentfrow talks about 
gay culture needing to be a little 
less "freaky," and "out-there." Do 
you mean "out-there" as in... gay? 
Alas, he doesn't clarify what he 
means by this, and unless he means 
yelling through a bullhorn I'm at a 
loss as to what he is talking about. 
The gay culture I know is filled 
with all kinds of people from all 
walks of life. There are those that 
could be considered "freaky" and 
those that are blander than corn- 
flakes. However, it seems with his 
criticism of EREN in his last col- 
umn and his general distaste with 
which he speaks of gays, I'm think- 
ing he wants gay culture to be a lit- 
tle less "gay." I'm not really sure 
how to do that yet — I tried only lik- 
ing men on Tuesdays and 
Thursdays {and alternating week- 
ends), but it just didn't work. If 



America is as ready to accept us ,v 
he says, it was because we spoke 
out, because we were noticed. It 
was not because we kept quiet so 
as to not upset people like Mr. 
Rentfrow from enjoying a quiet 
and "normal" society while we hid, 
scared and oppressed, in the closet. 
Finally, Mr. Rentfrow is 
right — the PC crowd has no sense 
of humor. However, Mr. Rentfrow 
was not justified in blaming the 
response he got on those PC peo- 
ple. In his articles, because I am gay 
I was called a heathen, charged 
with having sex with anything that 
moves, and hinted as someone 
who shoves their tongue down 
another male's throat when I first 
meet him. I'm going to go out on a 
limb and say that being offended 
by that is valid without needing 
political correctness on my side. 
Mr. Rentfrow's first article was not 

n't funny; it wasn't even controver- 
sial-funny like South Park or 
Family Guy. It was just plain mean. 
The article had no coherent argu- 
ment, was not poignant, educated, 
or even worthy of being called a 

better arguments come from Jerry 
Falwell, and that's saying some- 
thing. That original article had no 
value, and as I'm hoping to point 
out here, neither did Mr. 
Rentfrow's latest one. 

The Communicator either 
has very slim pickings for colum- 
nists or a dire misunderstanding of 
what makes a good social commen- 
tator. Mr. Rentfrow's writing and 
opinions rarely ever amount to 
anything worthwhile, much less a 
hill of beans. 

I'm hoping that someone 
with something more than "gays 
are (insert offensive and inappro- 
priate, sometimes lewd phrase 
here)'' decides to write on this sub- 
ject from a conservative view — but 
that's only if this topic need be 
drug on longer. I've heard some 
very thought-provoking anti-gay 
arguments, but I've never seen 
them published in this paper. Ifs 
time for Mr. Rentfrow to step down 
from his shoddy soap box, and let 
someone else take the stand for 
what's conservative and "right" so I 
have something challenging to 
debate — because man, you're just 
making it too easy.

Dealing with 
those final zits 



ALEXANDRIA, Va. --(COL- 
LEGIATE PRESSWIRE)- 

According to a recent 
study, the stress of exam time 
can bring on an added dis- 
traction for college students 
facing finals - a face full of 
pimples. With this in mind, 
the American Counseling 
Association (ACA) is urging 
students to focus on hitting 
the books and not let an acne 
breakout impact their aca- 



"Stress and acne have 
been anecdotally linked, and 
unfortunately the majority of 
college students experience 
both," reports Alexa B. 
Kimball, M.D„ director of 
clinical trials, Department of 
Dermatology at Stanford 
University School of 
Medicine. 

in the study recently 
published in the Archives of 
Dermatology, Dr. Kimball 
and colleagues tracked the 
stress and acne levels of 22 
university students during 
non-examination and exami- 
nation periods of a college 
semester. After adjusting for 
changing eating and sleeping 
habits, researchers uncov- 



ered a strong correlation 
between an increase in exam- 
related stress and progressive 
increase in acne severity. 

Further complicating the 
problem, research has shown 
that acne can negatively 
impact a student's self- 
esteem and affect academic 
achievement. But the ACA 
advises students not to let 
self-consciousness over a 
temporary condition distract 
from their studies. 

"College students have a 
lot of things on their minds, 
especially during exam time, 
and anxiety over acne 
shouldn't be one of them," 
said Jane Goodman, past- 
president of the ACA and 
professor, Department of 
Counseling, School of 
Education and Human 
Services at Oakland 
University. 

"Effective treatment 

options are available to help 
clear up acne, but clearing up 
the long-term effect of bad 
grades on your transcript 
won't be as easy. If acne is 
really troubling you, seek a 
doctor's care, so you can 
focus on your future."

Getting ready for the roadtrip 



Heading into their season 
opener on a trip south, the IPFW 
women's basketball squad will 

look l.i improve -from a win. 

The Mastodon's defeated 
Bethel College in a come-from- 
behind victory Nov. 12, 75-61. But 
the exhibition win wasn't a victo- 
ry without struggles. 

"It was one of our poorer per- 
formances. We're going to have to 
play a lot better when we go to 
Kentucky," IPFW women's coach 
Bruce Patterson said We missed 
way too many shots - a bunch of 
uncontested -.hots," he added. 

But the team did have bright 
spots. The coach was pleased with 
the defensive effort, especially in 
the second half. The team had 
made a goal of keeping Bethel 
under 60 points, and they only 
allowed two more points than 
they wanted. 

"When they had to, they did 
it. They did step up defensively," 
Patterson said-

games, the team defeated their

The Mastodons actu-

half, but struggled in the 
second, hitting just 6 of 
13. 

"We are pretty good

focus and concentra- 
tion," said Noll. 

Despite their strug- 
gles, IPFW was able to

Tournament team 

By Nick West 
The Communicator 

The 1PFW women volley- 
ball tf.ini finished fecund place in 
the Division 1 Independent 
Tournament this past weekend, 
but more importantly closed the 
season with 22 victories and a 
winning record tor the first time 
since the school's switch to 
Division 1 level. 

The Lady 'Dons, who 
won the tournament last year 
defeating Texas A&amp;M Corpus 
Christi, failed to repeat as champi- 
ons; nonetheless, head coach 
Kelley Hartley was pleased with 
the team's effort. 

"We were up and down at 
times, but I am certainly not dis- 
appointed with second place." she 
said. "We played great all year 
long, and I'm proud of that," 

1PFW finished 3-1 in the 
tournament and had their 12- 
game win streak snapped by 
eventual champion Northern 
Colorado on Saturday afternoon. 
The Bears finished their season 32- 
2, on a 25-game win streak.

that. But more importantly, they 
were the best defensive team we 
faced all season. They just wore 
us down," said Hartley. 

After winning the first 
game 30-27, the Lady 'Dons were 
unable to stop Northern 
Colorado, as the Bears ripped of 
victories of 30-22, 30-27, and 30- 
18. 

Sophomore Fabiana 

Souza paced the 'Dons with a 
match high 17 kills to go along 
with her eleven digs. Senior 
Kirsta Solberg and junior Lindi 
Rankmvski also added double- 
doubles. Solberg with 11 kills and 

14 dij;s; Minkowski with 4-4 assists 
and 10 digs. 

For the Bears, it was the 
hard-hitting quartet of Maggie 
and Terin Ledall, Amanda 
Wiggins, and Kara Miller. Terin 
Ledall was tops for the Bears with 

15 kills, followed by Wiggins with 
15 (also 15 digs), Maggie Ledall 
with 13, and Miller with 10.

Homecoming shap- 
ing up to be 
'Awesome, baby!' 

By Nick West 

The Communicator 

This Friday, ESPN per- 
sonality and animated college 
broadcaster Dick Vitale will be on 
IPFW campus signing books, 
mingling with students, and 
entertaining the university on 
Homecoming Day 2003. 

Dickie V, as he is better 
known as, will be signing copies 
of his new book "Living a Dream: 
Reflections on 25 Years Sitting in 
the Best Seat in the House," at the 
Gates Sports Center starting at 2 
p.m. 

The best chance to meet 
the "Awesome with a capital 'A'" 
man will be at the 4 p.m. Pep 
Rally at the Gates Center. The 
energy-filled ESPN broadcaster of 
25 years and former NBA head 
coach will mingle with students 
and do whatever it takes to pump 
up the Mastodon student body 
for the IPFW-Toledo basketball 

"This is really a once in a 

lifetime opportunity to have Dick 
Vitale on our campus for the stu- 
dents. I would encourage all 
IPFW students to do what they 
can to attend the Pep Rally at 4 
p.m. on Friday, because we want 
to make a statement to Dick Vitale 
that we are Division-1 and that 
we are ready to compete with the 
best of the best. Hopefully he 
will take that response with him 
when he televises games for the 
next four months," said IPFW 
Athletic Director Mark Pope. 

The Homecoming sched- 
ule of events is on page 13.
