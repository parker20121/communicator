Winter eased by health check-ups 

IPFW's Health and Wellness Clinic offers a way for students and faculty to shed those unwanted pounds 



By Kira Schowe 
Sports Editor 



Blood pressure, weight, body 
fat. body mass and blond sugar 
were recently the subjects of an 
event held in Gates on Monday 
January 8. The IPFW depart- 
ment of Athletics Recreation 
and Intramural Sports and 
IPFW/Parkview Health and 
Wellness Clinic sponsored the 
event. 

This event is a good base 
line for people to start keeping 
track, and staying involved with 
their bodies and fitness, said 
Kate Black, a certified personal 
trainer whom was helping out 
with the event. 

This event which is a free 
service offered to the com- 
munity is held on every sec- 
ond Monday of every month 
through June. The intention of 
the 'health screenings' is to as- 
sist IPFW students and mem- 
bers of the community to keep 
track of their health.

SAB plans for an 
activity filled semester 



With a new semester here. 
Students Activities Board 
(SAB) has a full itinerary of 
events planned for the students 
at IPFW. 

Pat Shirley, Student, Body 
Programming Director for 
SAB, said "I am excited about 
all our activities but I am really 
looking forward Jusdon Laip- 
ply's 'Evolution of Dance*. His 
YouTube video was the most 
watched video of the year." 

Liapply 's "Evolution of 
Dance" will take place in the 
Walb Ballroom on Thurs., Jan. 
1 1 , from noon until 1 p.m. Free 
Subway sandwiches will be 
given away at the function. 

However, SAB has a num- 



ber of other festivities planned 
throughout the semester. These 
range from sporting events to 
the return of Clearly You Crys- 
tals, for Valentines Day. 

With IPFW's athletic de- 
partments recent induction to 
the Mid-Con Conference, SAB 
is aiding in the attempt to boost 
student attendance at the sport- 
ing events 

Shifley says, "Ihope students 
will come to the athletic events 
we sponsor - we are handing 
out free t-shirts and hoping to 
build more student support for 
our athletic teams." 

Robert Burns, a member of 
SAB and a Student Govern- 
ment Senator, feels that home- 
coming week is the most suc- 
cessful activity put on by the 
activities board "because it al- 



lows most of the student body 
to participate in the events and 
allows us to gain exposure." 

Even though Homecoming 
has come and gone. SAB has 
a similar event planned for 
the spring semester, "Spring 
Fling", held the week of April 
16-20. 

Bums says that students 
should "get involved. The 
number of events that people 
miss out on because they don't 
take the time to read a tlyer or 
as questions is just a shame. 
If people took the time to get 
involved they would enjoy 
the campus experience much

Podium 

Style at IPFW represents diversity 



By Jessica Ruckn 



As the t\ 
gins, one of the aspects of 
campus life that I look for- 
ward to the most, believe it or 
not, is fashion. 

Trudging through six inch- 
es of snow with eighty pounds 
of books on my back is not 
my idea of fun, but as I schlep 
from Classroom Medical to 
Kettler Hall, I keep my head 
up and watch all of the differ- 
ent people pass, although I'm 
not typically looking at their 
faces. I am mesmerized by 
their style. 

We as IPFW students don't 
have a lot to look forward to 
in the middle of January, what 
with the heaps of snow and 
frozen nasal cavities that we 
battle as we debate the merits 
of walking all the way across 
campus for yet another class 
or running home to our still- 



warm beds. 

But I take that opportunity 
of walking across campus to 
really look at all of the fash- 
ion parading past me. 
Our student body is so incred- 
ibly diverse, and being from 
any and every point on the 
globe, we really are a melt- 
ing pot of cultures and back- 
grounds. Those cultures are 
personified by what we wear 
and how we wear it. My fa- 
vorite place to walk on cam- 
pus is the main walkway from 
Helmke Library to Kettler 
Hall. 

Everyone walks that way 
at some point in his or her 
school week, and it is the per- 
fect vantage point for people 
watchers such as myself to 
really sit back and enjoy our 
campus culture. 

I know as well as anybody 
else that style is a reflection 
of personality. 



personal opinions. Really 
looking at someone (without 
resembling a stalker, obvi- 

dication of the person under- 
neath, but for a true analysis 
of a person, of course we are 
to look inside. 

I understand that most who 
read this article will brush it 
off With the thought that this 
is a "fluff' piece. However, 
my challenge to you is to stop 
looking at your shoes or your 
cell phones when you walk 
across campus or sit in the li- 
brary, and take a closer look 
at the diversity here at IPFW. 

We are not nearly as bor- 
ing as we are projected to be 
and I have so much respect 
for the people who represent 
their style their own way be- 
cause they want to just for 
themselves, and not because 
they want so desperately to (it

Said Said Something 



If you haven't seen it yet, 
then I only advise that you 
don't which means you prob- 
ably will anyways. Confused?

that leaked

No, I'm not talking about 
Justin Timberlake's SNL music 
video for 'Blank in a Box,' bin 
Saddam Hussein's execution 
video, which has reached and 
scarred the eyes of millions 
across the world. 

What makes this video so 
controversial is not the fact that 
some guy leaked the clip, be- 
cause let's be honest, we might 
have well all saw it coming. 
Plus, with today's technology. 



I'm surprised the cell phone 
camera didn't have better qual- 
ity- not that I'm complaining. 
It also wasn't the cinematogra- 
phy, which happened to capture 
the event in an oh-so-creepy

people and their correlation to 
the succeeding democracy in 

■Since the majority of you 
don't know Arabic, I will con- 
veniently explore the dialogue 
and the scene so that you don't 
have to watch the clip your- 
selves. The scene is set in some 
random dark room with appar- 
ently two levels. Saddam looks 
and remains calm as the noose 
is set around his neck. The man 
who, for all these years has 
been portrayed as a passionate- 
ly-violent and strict ruler, ap- 
peared at peace and found. His 
last words were 'a Shahadah,' 
a pillar of Islam that defines 
one's acceptance and submis- 
sion to Allah and his messen- 
ger. 

While Saddam may be calm, 
the room explodes into chant- 
ing and excitement where one 
could clearly hear the name 
Muqtada Al-Sadr, leader of the 
Shi'as, and their disapproval of 
Saddam. 

The hanging is not as rel- 
evant as to the conduct of the 
hanging. In reality, the US is re- 
sponsible for Saddam's execu- 
tion, and they screwed up. The 
video doesn't provide a visual 



of justice. It reinforces the out 
of control civil war in Iraq, 
dominated by a once con- 
trolled people. At least when 
Saddam was president, there 
was order. Yes, he is respon- 
sible for thousands of deaths, 
but at the end of the day, Sad- 
dam is merely another victim 
to our corrupt way of "gctti ng 
the job done." 

Did I forget to mention that 
the trial wasn't even over? 
Did I forget to mention that 
the hanging looked like re- 
venge? Did I forget to men- 
tion that 20,000 more troops 
are to be sent to Iraq? And so 
I wonder if our administration 
forgot to mention something. 

Some days I wake up feel- 
ing like I should start a revo- 
lution. I don't know how. I 
don't know when. But I'm 
getting tired of hearing truth 
NOT from our government. 
I'm tired of seeing the truth 
from cell phones NOT from. 



So what if the truth hurts! 
That is how people become 
better and stronger. Better 
and stronger people are able 
to contribute positively to a 

You can be tired for so long 
before you take a nap or sleep 
a whole eight hour cycle. But 
when you wake up, its there 
and it is sometimes clearer 
than ever. Screw hindsight

A little Quahog in Iraq 



By Curtis J. Nash 



I am ever the optimist, 
personally. It helps me keep 
some perspective when I keep 
abreast of the news of the 
world and keeps me from de- 
scending into a maelstrom of 
despair. In other words, day 
to day events can cause one 
to become bogged down with 
a close-up view of the trees if 
one does not keep an eye on 
the forest. It is this perspec- 
tive, this unfailing "glass liall- 
full" philosophy, which leads 
me to believe that perhaps our 
military's commander-in-chief 
is attempting to bring our time 
in Iraq to a close. 

Commander Bush can- 
not simply say "forget it, you 
are on your own Iraq," and 
bring our troops back home, 
just because the American peo- 
ple are overwhelmingly against 
our youngsters being in harm's 
way. This would be political 
suicide. It would mean that his 
objective in Iraq had been unat- 
tainable, that his plan had been 
flawed in its short-sightedness, 
and that he had "cut and run." 
To admit defeat and humbly 
lick his wounds and beg for- 
giveness from the American 
people would be disastrous for 
his party and for him. So, in- 
stead consider the recent chain 
of events. It reads like a script 
written for a straight-to-video 

As the congressional 
elections approach in Novem- 
ber, it becomes apparent, due to 



polls and such, thai republican 
incumbents are on their way 
out nationwide. Secretary of 
Defense Donald "Scapegoat" 
Rumsfeld accepts the heat and 
tenders his resignation. George 
W. Bush accepts his resigna- 
tion, with no mention of the 
fact that in the past, when Sec- 
retary Rumsfeld had offered 
his resignation, the President 
circled his political wagons 
and refused to accept. A blue- 
ribbon, bi-partisan panel of ex- 
perts, ranging from Lee Ham- 
ilton lo Howard Baker to Leon 
Panetta, are asked to assess the 
situation in Iraq and give their 
recommendations. What could 
be the reason for this, when 
President Bush has experts 
and strategists at his beck and 
call already? All the commit- 
tee members are seen as clear- 
headed and above partisanship 
and the result ("Duhh") is that 
Iraq is a quagmire. 

Enter new Secretary of 
Defense Robert Gates, who is 
appointed with no opposition in 
the Senate, not even a whimper 
of protest, and the first chance 
he gets to speak, he tells the 
world that we are losing the 
war and the plan for Iraq is... 
you know. Has this all been a 
carefully-drawn out scheme 
for Bush to bring American 
troops home without the politi- 
cal backlash of having been a 
failure at the cost of thousands 
and thousands of American and 
Iraqi lives? Eternally the opti- 
mist, I would love to believe

Intelligence shouldn't be overlooked 
because of age or gender 



By Stephanie Samples 

Every year in January it 
seems everyone is trying to 
change their lives in some 
way. Some try to Jose weight; 
others try to quit smoking, 
some make goals for changes 
in their financial situations ;md 
many want to make changes in 
their personal lives. 

Most years I participate 
in these resolutions, and rarely 
have any of ihem worked out. 
I understand the reasoning be- 
hind these changes in the be- 
ginning of a New Year, but the 
most important changes that 
we want to make seem so su- 
perficial. 

Of course, everyone slips 
into the hopes of losing that 
extra ten pounds, and although 
I support being healthier but 
most of the time the weight 
loss has nothing to do with 
health, bill is purely cosmetic. 
Another popular resolu- 
tion is finding your soul mate. 
I cannot turn on the television 
without seeing a commercial 
for some kind of online dat- 
ing. I hale to offend anyone 
hut I think the idea of having 
a computer lind your perfect 
match is ridiculous. 



I know that for some find 
ing someone compatible to 
you may be difficult, but isn't 
meeting someone, and feeling 
something so much better than 
filling out surveys. 

Goals to get better jobs and a 
more stable financial situation 
seem to also be very popular, 
but shouldn't that be a continu- 
ous goal, noi just when January 
first rolls around? 

Quitting smoking is one of 
the most popular resolutions 
which I think is a good idea, but 
chances are a long lime smoker 
is not going to quit just because 
they made a resolution. 

The word is out, smok- 
ing is bad for you. but then 
again so are hamburgers and 
fries and people are still in- 
haling those along with the 
smoke. 

While change can be a very 
good thing, especially when 
it benefits a persons" life, the 
change should be made when 
it fits in your life not on your 
calendar. 

1 find it to be a good thing 
that some of the most popular 
resolutions that we have made 
are quitting habits are bud for 
us, and bad thai many are things 
that only change the surface. 



More people should make 
resolutions that change their 
Haws that are more than skin 
deep. With so much that should 
change in our world, losing 
live pounds shouldn't be the 
biggest concern. 

I don't mean to sound like 
I think I am superior to it all 
because I know 1 am not, but 
when I was thinking of my 
resolutions I was disappointed 
with the changes that first came 
to my mind. I thought again 
about what should change. 

If the thing I think is most 
important to change about my- 
self is on the surface than I need 
to look deeper. Each year we 
should all try to improve in all 
areas of our life, but we should 
think about improvements that 

Most people would like to 
change things about their ap- 
pearance, and that is perfectly 
normal, but is would be silly to 
think that everything about our 
personalities are perfect and 
that nothing needs to change. 

If you made a resolution 
and haven't told anyone what 
it is, keep it that way. If you are 
changing for someone other 
than yourself, it's not worth 
changing at all.

Short 'Winter Break' welcomes the new semester 



By Michelle Yahne 



Ah. January. Inevitable. 
The beginning of resolutions, 
winter, and unfortunately, the 
start of the ever so cumber- 
some spring semester. As I sit 
here writing this, I know that get up from school 
in just a few hours, my pre- glimpse of life without 

cious Christmas, ahem, 

"Winter Break", 



After a certain point I got 
bored with just going to work 
and then coming home. With no 

homework or projects awaiting 

me, the routine of going with 

friends, being able to sleep in 

day. and not having to 






..well, the drop out rate 
come from somewhere. 



"Is it just me, or does the 

spring semester seem like it 

last twice as long as fall?" 



Mil be 
over. It never seems long 
enough, especially if you 
go somewhere for the 
holidays. Alter factoring 
in lost time from travel — 
and working more, it 

doesn't seem like such a break I think that for most students 
after all. on campus, even though we sit 

Even the thought of proj- and complain about classes, 
eels, homework, and worst, 9 professors, and parking, we are 
a,m. classes, has made me all all in the same boat (pardon my 
but excited to return to school, lame analogy). Knowing that 
I can't help but express my we are ready for school to start 
lackluster attitude. is unavoidable, and heck, if we 



right? 

Is it just me, or does the 
spring semester seem like it 
lasts twice as long as fall? Docs 
it last so long because we want 
summer to arrive promptly 
with warmer weather and the 
thought of vacations? Perhaps 
it's because when we wake up 
it's still dark out, and when we 
finally get done with our day, 
it's dark again! 

So get ready to trudge 
through snow, ice, and park- 
ing lots full of cars once 
again- to sit in full classes and 
peer outside wishing you were 
back in your warm bed watch- 
ing "Saved by the Bell" reruns 
with a bowl of cereal. Let's just 
hope that our mild winter con- 
tinues, and that finals week and 
summer make a hasty return. 



Two thousand and seven 
is finally here and I've made 
my resolution. I've decided 
to give up working with idiots. 
I'm not going to do it anymore. 
It stresses me out and I don't 
like it. 

Wait. What? It's impos- 
sible? Why? Because morons 
exist at every corner? Crap. It 
seemed like such a good idea. 
Here's the crux of the is- 
sue; I hate being young. It is 
even more loathsome when 
one works in an industry full 
of macho men and subservient 
women; like, I dunno, a fac- 
tory. 

That, folks, is where I work. 
How, you may be asking your- 
self . did such an iiber-femi- 
nist come to work in such a 
rage-provoking business? One 
word: nepotism. My dad had 
a job. I needed one. Presto. 
I'm in Simpleton Heaven. You 
can bet your life savings that if 
Pop hadn't gotten me the job, I 
wouldn't have picked it! 
As a mere 23-year-old wom- 



an ... excuse me, girl ... it's im- 
possible for me to actually do 
my job, you see. After all. the 
only things that skip through 
my skull are the vapid, moron- 
ic, inconsequential thoughts of 
peace, equality, and hope. Why 
do you look so shocked? Were 
you expecting me to say "hair, 
clothes, and girls"? If so, then 
you obviously know me about 
as well as my employer does. 

Regardless of my undeniably 
young age and noticeable gen- 
der, though, I do have a work- 
ing brain that can occasionally 
muster an intelligible thought. 
It's amazing, I know. But, lam 
a person that can actually take 
instruction and bring what is 
expected to fruition. 

Contrary to the popular be- 
lief on site, I don't need the 
symbolic, yet remarkably pa- 
tronizing, pat on the head when 
I've done a good job. Or even 
when I've mentioned a new 
idea. The one that I share may, 
oddly enough, help our drown- 
ing IT Department. I know it's 
hard to comprehend, but I have 
something else to offer our di- 
vision other than acting as the 
"token chick".

Through the rest of the half 
IPFW made small runs to pull 
in front, but just could not shake 
the Cardinals. Every time that 
it looked as if the 'Dons were 
going to put away Saginaw 
Valley, the Cardinals would re- 
spond to get back in game with 



by Natalie Roberts' 10 first half 
points and Johnna Lewis-Carl- 
isle's nine, the 'Dons led 36-34 
at the break. 

IPFW opened up the second 
half and made it look like they 
were going to put away the 
Cardinals for good. 

Jr. Johnna Lewis-Carlisle 
came out shooting with two 3- 
pointers. two other field goals, 
and the 'Dons were up by eight 
with 15 minutes to go in the 
game. Saginaw Valley called 
a time-out and just like a pen- 
dulum, the momentum swung 
back towards the Cardinals. 

Latille Ross scored six straight 
points and following an IPFW 
turnover Tricia Everett hit her 
only shot of the game and tied 
it up at 49 with just less than 1 2

lead. 

IPFW then went on a 7-3 
run to open their lead up to 64- 
55 with six minutes remaining. 
That was when the pendulum 
swung lor the last time towards 
the Cardinals. 

Valerie Smith scored five 
points, Latille Ross scored 



four, and Jenna Schroeder hit 
the Cardinals only 3-poinler 
of the second hall to give them 
the lead with less than 10 sec- 
onds remaining.

took over the game for the 
'Dons. She scored seven of 
her ten points in the next three' 
s, giving them a 57-52 




Johnna Leuis-CarlMi* d 



key, and made a move that got 
the defender going backwards. 
That gave her enough room to 
get a good look and take an 
open shot, but the ball was just 
short with about two seconds 
left. ■ 

The ball bounded off to to- 
wards the sideline where Sagi- 
naw Valley rebounded and ran 
out the clock. To lead the way 
for the ' Dons was Johnna Lew- 
is-Carlisle with 23 points, 5 re-
