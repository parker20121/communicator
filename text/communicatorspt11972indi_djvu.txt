Ed division 

accredited 

The Division of Edu- 
cation has been accredited 
by the National Council 
for Accreditation of Teach- 
er Education (NCATE) for 
all undergraduate educa- 
tion degrees and the mas- 
ter of science In educa- 
tion, it was announced by 
Dr. Charles L. Sharp, 
chairman. The accredi- 
tation extends to 1982. 

This Is the first time 
the Fort Wayne Campuahas 
been specifically approved. 
Previous approval has been 
extended to the Indiana U- 
nlverslty System as a 
whole. 

Accreditation by NCATE 
Is the-hlghest possible na- 
tional approval of education 
programs, vlrtuallyassur- 
ing education graduates 
certification to teach In 
most states of the nation. 
Dr. Sharp emphasized that 
teacher education colleges 
and universities In this 
area are first approved by 
the state, then by the North 
Central Association of Sec- 
ondary Schools and Col- 
leges (a regional organi- 
zation), and finally by 
NCATE. This Council, cre- 
ated bythe American Asso- 
ciation ofCollegesfor Tea- 
cher Education, sets aca- 
demic standards and con- 
ducts visits and on-site 
inspections of education 
programs to determine If 
they qualify for approval. 

The university here meets 
all standards of NCATE 
and even exceeds some 
standards set forth by state 
law. For Instance, the 
state requires 18 hours 
In education coursei 
a total of 124 hours for a 
degree In secondary ed- 
ucation. The Fort Wayne 
program requires 21 hours 
In education courses. Of 
these, eight must be In 
student teaching though 
the law requires only six.

More violence in the inner city 



The flair of violence 
that Bwept through ihe ease 
central portion of Fort 
Wayne, hae fortunately 
subsided. The mayor, 
through his apparent wlU- 
lngnc8B to talk It over, 
has promised to help 
remedy some of the issues 
which sparked the disturb- 
ance. Amongihemost noted 
problems were "poltceand 
white harassement, prosti- 
tution and Jobopponunitles 
for blacks In the city", 
T' s^ems that the most re- 
sented policemen In the 



dispute Is a County Police- 
man, not a City Policeman. 
If In fact, the relations be- 
tween the police, the 
mayor, and the people are 
not good, calling a police- 
man a SOB Is not going to 
win many friends. It pro- 
bably would have been 
better to have him trans- 
ferred to another patrol 
than to create more ani- 
mosity between the 
County Police and the 
mayor. Any way, the mayor 
has made his decision, he'll 
have to live with it one way 
or another.

City Council adopts budget to reduce tax 



The Fort Wayne City 
Council formally adopted a 
new budget which calls 
for a three cent reduction 
In the city property tax 
rate per 100 dollars as- 
sessed valuation. Also 
In the Council meeting was 
debate and defeat of a bill 
which would have cut the 
council member's travel-

College exam 
program on 
campus 

A College-Level Exam- 
ination Program [CLEP) 
Open Test Center has been 
opened on the Indiana-Pur- 
due Fon Wayne Campus 
under the supervision of 
Dr. Charles Bolyard, di- 
rector of counseling and 
testing. 

CLEP Is designed to 
serve the non- traditional 
student who has acquired 
knowledge through corre- 
spondence and extension 
courses, educational tele- 
vision, adult education pro- 
grams, on-the-job training 
and Independent study. It 
Is based on the concept 
that what a person knows 
is more Important than 
how he learned it. 

Dr. Bolyard suggested 
that persons desiring addi- 
tional Information about 
the CLEP should contact 
the Counseling and Testing 
office by calling 483-8121, 
Extension 362, or by stop- 
ping by Room 105 of the 
Main Educational Building. 
The hours for the office 
are 8 a.m. to noon, or 1 
to 5 p.m., Monday-Friday, 
Dr. Bolyard stressed that 
there are two types of ex- 
aminations. The General 
Examinations are designed 
to provide a comprehensive 
measure of undergraduate 
achievement In five basic 
areas of liberal arts (Eng- 
lish composition, mathe- 
matics, natural science, 
humanities, social scien- 
ces, history), and the Sub- 
ject Examinations are de- 
signed to measure achieve- 
ment in specified under- 
standings. 

The director - stated that 
examinations are made 
available on specified test- 
ing dates to anyone who 
desires to take them. In 
addition, Dr, Bolyard cau- 
tioned that neither the Col- 
lege-Level Examination 
nor the College Entrance 
Examination Board, its 
sponsor, can award college 
credit. This kind of rec- 
ognition can be made only 
by a college or university. 
Persons interested in re- 
ceiving college credit 
should contact the college 
of their choice, find out 
which examination scores 
will be accepted and how 
well they will have to per- 
form on the examinations 
to be granted credit at that 
college.

The Dual University 

Who schedules 
space this week? 



The malnienance aiaff 
has been asked co relo- 
cate a large board con- 
taining Che University cal- 
endar of events. It Is be- 
ing moved to another of- 
fice tor "permanent" lo- 
cation. 

This seems to be the 
third or fourth "perma- 
nent" relocation of the 
board, which accompanies 
the administrator schedu- 
ling space and calendar for 
the UnlversUy, The per- 
son handling the schedul- 
ing process changes as of- 
ten as the board. 

The responsibility for 
calendar and space Is han- 
dled by each Institution 
In alternate years. Cur- 
rently Indiana Is Incharge; 
next March 1, Purdue takes 
over. The problems this 
presents are numerous. 

Flret of all, the re- 
sponslblltty Is given to am 
already busy administra- 
tion as a second Job. An 
Important full-time func- 
tion becomes "one more 
damn thing to do," 

Secondly, human nature 
causes one to take pride 
In his work. A tempor- 
ary Job Just win not In- 
voke this pride 



Last year's schedule de- 
signed a computer program 
for the classroom assign- 
ment. When he left the 
Job, the computer program 
was discarded and the work 
Is now done by hand. 

All these situations would 
be alleviated If we had one 
full-time scheduler. 

This has been suggested 
many times, but never ef- 
fected. The Institutions 
cannot agree on who the 
scheduler should be. 

From a student's point 
of view, the job can be 
lied with the registrar's 
office or even the admin- 
istrative dean's office. It 
Just needs to be located 
permanently. 

The time spent relocat- 
ing the board Is minimal. 
The time spent admini- 
stratively each spring ad- 
justing to the newjoblaun- 
necessary and exiremely 
wasteful. 



Editor's note: 

This Is the first In a series 
of editorials discussing the 
problems and wastes 
caused by a dual admini- 
stration.

Campus Book-Walk 
to move I-P library 



September 20 will offer 
students the opportunity to 
play a significant role In 
the development of the 
campus. That Is the date 
of the "Book Walk," the 
project designed co move 
the entire l-VV library 
from the Main Educational 
Building to Building B. 

The purpnse of rhe "Book 
Walk" istokeepthellbrary 
open. Standard moving 
methods mean a closed 
library for up to three o 
four weeks. 

Each participant will 
be handed an armful of 
books by a librarian at the 
old site. He will then 
carry these books along 
a pre-deiermlned path to 
a librarlanlnthenewbulld- 
Ing. This constitutes one 
trip. 

It has been estimated 
that ti win takeover 20,000 
man-trips between build- 
ings to effect the move. 
That is only three per stu- 



An hour or so of every- 
one's lime Insures an open 
library after one day. A 
closed library is absurd, 
let alone inconvenient. 
Each trip you make opens 
the library one-half hour 
sooner. 

Calculate the time you 
will need to spend in the 
library next month. Can 
you afford to drive to an- 
other library for study? 

Will you make your three 
trips in the "Book Walk?" 
Or would you rather not 
gel Involved? 

The architect has de- 
signed a spacious as well 
as a beautiful building. Now 
you must provide the books. 
The newspaper staff 
challenges any student 
organization or group of 
Students to out-walk us. 
Our goal is 100 trips. What 
is yours? 

Get involved. Walk some 
.books. ,, 




CroH pledges 
support of ABC 

To the Editor, 

Last April, an election 
was held on this campus 
for Student Government 
positions. The ABC team 
for President and Vice- 
President, Able and Hen- 
son, won by two votes. 
After a recount and a Su- 
preme Coun decision con- 
concerning certain proce- 
dures, the AAA Cress- 
Booker candidates were 
ahead by seven. At the 
end of the sf Timer, another 
count found that Able- 
Henson won by four votes. 
This final tally has been 
recognized by all concern- 
ed. 

In the months ahead, I 
will welcome the oppor- 
tunity CO stand by the elect- 
ed officials and to give aid 
In a constructive manner. 
Upon occasion I will com- 
ment on the progress and 
actions of the new Students' 
Government, At no time 
will I use this newspaper 
as a "battleground" a- 
galnst a student or against 
the Students' Government, 
I am looking forward to 
a prosperous year ahead.

Student romplains of ridiculoui traffic eitnation 



Dear Editor: 

After being made late 
CO class several times last 
year because of the rld- 
culouB traffic situation In 
front of the campus, I de- 
cided CO finally speak for 
my own benefit and for 
the benefit of fellow stu- 
dents. 

As most I-PU drivers 
know, there are two lanes 
of traffic heading east on 
the bypass. Aftercrossing 
the bridge, a left turning 
lane for campus usage 
branches off the malnbigb- 
way. A left turn alf^nal 
is provided so that cajnpus 
traffic can easily enter 
I-PU territory. 

However, the problem 
Is getting Into "the left 
turn lane. During times 
of heavy traffic (which is 
during most of the day) 
bypass traffic g oing 
straight past the campus 
entrance tends Co fill the 
left regular lane along wlch 
the r iRbt straiaht lane 
making It Impossible for 
scudencs to squeeze Into the 
cum lane. 

The left turn light 
turns green before the 
going straight light, so 



often theturn light becomes 
green and no cars going 
to I-PU can turn left. They 
are stuck behind Ignorant 
drivers &lt;wich their left 
blinkers on, no less) until 
the regular U^ht turns 
green. 

This problem often 
results In scudencs like my- 
self arriving late to class, 
which we all hate co do. 

Now you're probably 
thinking chls Is a good com- 
plaint, but you're probably 
also wondering what can be 
done. 

I suggest that all traffic 
heading straight be con- 
fined to the right lane of 
the highway in order for 
us to be able to turn left.

the FORUM 

This week's topic: Abortion 



Compulsory pregnancy 
and logical alternative 



Scream bloody 
murder: a 
^conservative' view 



"The world turns and 
the world changes, but one 
thing doeanotchange. How- 
ever you dlBgiilae It, ihje 
thing does not change: The 
perpetual struggle of Good; 
and Evil," 

One of the more bitter 
current manifestations of 
this struggle Is the abor- 
tion controversy. The 
principle Involved is the 
killing ofaninnocenthuman 
being because his exist- 
ence Is Inconvenient or un- 
comfortable to others. 

The fifth grade sex edu- 
cation text in the New York 
City school system says, 
"Human life begins when 
the sperm cells of the 
father and the egg cells of 
the mother unite," 

Dr. Charles Rice of the 
Notre Dome Law School 
adds: "When the child in 
the womb weighs only one- 
thirtieth of an ounce, he has 
every internal organhe will 
ever has as an adult. On 
the eighteenth day after his 
conception his heart starts 
beating. At eighteen weeks, 
he can suck his thumb, 
scratch himself and even 
cry, although he makes no 
sound because there Is no 
air In the womb. He can 
feel pain," 

The methods of accom- 
plishing this murder are 
horrendous. Until the 12th 
week after conception, 
a common procedure is 
dilation of the entrance to 
the uterus and curettage. 
The whole uterine cavity Is 
curretted with shon 
strokes, by visualizing a 
clock and making a stroke 
at each hour. A small 
forcepts Is used to ouU out 
the tissue. Fetal parts 
such as arms, legs, and a 
head are recognizable in 
pregnancies beyond the 
seventh week. 

Beyond the fourteenth 
week of pregnancy, the 
child can be killed in two 
ways. One Is to Inject a 
salt or glucose solution In- 
to the womb. By this means 
the baby Is simply pickled 
alive. 

The other technique is 
hysterotomy, where an In- 
cision Is made in the mo- 
ther's abdomen and the 
child is lifted out. Mrs. 
JlU Knight, a Member of 
Parliament In England, de- 
scribed an abortion of this 
type she witnessed In Swe- 
den: 

"In Sweden. If the child 
has not been killed by the 
operation, they drown It 
In a bucket like a kitten. 
The child wiU kick mis- 
, erably until It dies. They 
•-atso ■doexpertmenrSDn 



aborted babies. Put them 
in simulated wombs and 
feed them through the cord, 
poking them now and again 
to see If they are still a- 
llve," 

Christians cannot possi- 
bly condone such an ab- 
horrent perversion of 
God's plan. Nor do 1 see 
how anything but a hypo- 
critical Christian could 
vote for a candidate for 
public office who would 
support such a brutal vio- 
lation of the most basic hu- 
man right. To claim it's 
murder, and then to vote for 
an advocate of it Is blatant 
hypocrisy. 

A good conservative friend 
of mine, who Is a columnist 
for the Indiana Daily Stu- 
dent at Sloomlngton, re- 
ceived an irate letter from 
a girl who sounded as If 
Baron had gotten her preg- 
nant, after he wrote a crit- 
ique of the abortion claque. 
She whined on about how 
he was hard-hearted and 
calloused concerning the 
mother's right to play 
cardg or go bowling when 
she desired. If a mis- 
take, innocent or not, is 
made, butchering the baby 
hardly rectifies it. 

If a person loses his 
struggle against Evil, he 
most certainly Is not pro- 
mised a bed of roses. 

Mark So-jder 



I would like to suggest 
some other, perhaps less 
colorful, ways of looking 
at the problem of termi- 
nating pregnancies than 
were presented in the last 
issue of the Communicator. 
If the views presented were 
only those of a single Indi- 
vidual, It would not be use- 
ful to respond. However, 
Indiana does not permltthe 
termination of a pregnancy, 
nor counseling with regard 
to ending a pregnancy In 
another state. Are these 
laws rational? 

First, what about the 
child? It is estimated that 
35-45% of the population of 
the United States consists 
of unwanted births (Prince- 
ton Office of Population Re- 
search). While not all un- 
wanted babies are unloved 
babies, there Is a definite 
correlation between an un- 
wanted pregnancy and a 
child that Is subsequently 
abused or battered (Helper, 
1968). 

On a less extreme level, 
it is those parents who were 
not desirous ofhavlngchll- 
dren who do not show the 
normal development of 
attachment to the Infant 
(Robson and Moss, 1969). 
Motherhood, unlike en- 
gagement, marriage, or a 
career decision, is not re- 
versible. Weplacethebur- 
den to socialize the child 
largely, and often com- 
pletely, on the mother, but 
we In Indiana do not grant 
her the possibility of mak- 
ing a choice about mother- 
hood. 

It is Irresponsible to bear 
an unwanted child, but 
women are forced into that 
irresponsibility. 1 would 
much prefer that every 



child be a wanted child. 
For the sake of the child, 
I am not In favor of com- 
pulsory pregnancies. . . 

Why do I speak of com- 
pulsory pregnancies rather 
than of abortion? Largely 
to call atentlon to the fact 
that few Individuals are 
considering what the real 
alternatives arefor the wo- 
man. Whether or not the 
mother chooses to give the 
child up for adoption at 
binh, the basic alterna- 
tives available to a preg- 
nant woman who does not 
want a chlldareabortionor 
compulsory pregnancy. 

No matter what the wishes 
of the parents are, the law 
does not allow the preg- 
nancy to be terminated. Is 
this not a form of Involun- 
tary servitude? I believe 
that the termination of 
pregnancy should be choice 
available for the pregnant 
woman, according to her 
personal and rellgiouadlc- 
tates. 

Women should have the 
right to control their own 
bodies, to decide whether 
or not to use contracep- 
tion, to decide whether or 
not they want an abortion, 
to decide whether or not 
they wish to have babies. 
Since women do not parti- 
cipate in our courts of law 
or our seats of democracy, 
they have not been Involved 
In the decisions which af- 
fect their private lives. 
Women should have been 
involved in these decisions. 

Is It too bold to suggest 
that few men can under- 
stand pregnancy or deliv- 
ery or the reaction of a 
woman to the denial of an 
abortion? Perhaps anana- 
logy otf&gt;;red by Dr. Nata- 



Abortion-is the state responsible? 



For the past who knows 
how many Issues of this 
paper, in semester after 
semester, we have been 
reading about whether 
abortion is proper or not. 
Has anyone ever questioned 
whether the state has the 
right to decide such an 
issue? And If so, has any- 
one ever questioned whe- 
ther the state has any re- 
sponsibility for the con- 
sequences of such a deci- 
sion? 

Leaving the question 
of abortion's propriety to 
those engagedlnthe debate, 
1 propose that the omni- 
potent arrogance' of the 
state be questioned in the 
light of cause and effect. 
If the state presumes to 
take upon itself the right 
to declare that a woman 
must carry a pregnancy 
to full term. It seems only 
proper that it take upon 
Itself the responsibility for 
the welfare of the resultant 
child. There are too man^ 
■onwBtcome--trtnidren- al- 



ready who are suffering 
atrocities unmentionable 
for the sole crime of being 
born. 

My feeling Is that, if a 
woman desires an abor- 
tion and. If the state de- 
clares that such a deci- 
sion Is properly its alone 
to make, then the conse- 
quences of such a deci- 
sion should also be that 
of the state alone to bear. 

I propose that a woman 
sold into Involuntary serv- 
itude as an Incubator for 
the state be granted the 
following services as her 
right. I propose thact 

1) The pregnant woman 
be hired as a civil ser- 
vice employee for the term 
of her pregnancy and com- 
pensated accordingly; 

2) All pregnancy related 
expenses be paid by the 
state; 

3) All expenses of the 
resultant child be the re- 
sponsibility of the state 
until such time as the child 
becomes hW-'sWibiehi;' 



4) If the mother agreesto 
raise the child, she be 
continued as an employee 
of the state until the child 
leaves home; 

5) A bonus be paid the 
woman for the risks in- 
volved and the inconven- 
iences suffered whilecom- 
pelled to conduct her body 
as chattel and her self as 
slave of the state during 
the period of her servi- 
tude. 

Such a program would 
lessen theburdencurremly 
imposed on the welfare 
rolls. Even though the 
civil service payroll would 
be larger, taxpayers would, 
for the first time in his- 
tory, see that particular 
branch of our government 
engaged ;n productive la- 
bor. 

Isn't it funny how just 
asking a different question 
about a subject often leads 
to a completely new set of 
answers? 

Marty Mart'iiiPz 



lie Shalness, noted tor her 
work In the psychology of 
women and the mothering 
aspect of women's experi- 
ence would make the re- 
action to the denial of an 
abortion more under- 
standable: 

"...It's as If, let's say, 
people are walking along 
the street. ..some get a- 
cross the street, some are 
stopped by a red light and 
let's assume that for no o- 
ther reason than that they 
are stopped by a red light, 
these people are told this; 

'From now on, for about 
nine months, you are going 
to have to carry a 25- 
pound pack on your back. 
Now you will have to en- 
dure It, whether you deve- 
lop ulcers under the load, 
whether your spine be- 
comes deformed, you and 
this are Inseparable. 

"Then after nine months 
you may drop this load, 
but from now on you are 
going to have it tied to 
your waist. So that wher- 
ever you go this Is going 
to be with you the rest of 
your life, and If, by some 
accident, the rope Is cut 
or the chain is cut, that 
piece of rope Is always 
going to be tied to you to 
remind you of It." (Schul- 
der and Kennedy: Abor- 
tion Rap, p. 125). 

It may well be the case 
that in the not loo dis- 
tant future women will be 
prohibited from what they 
are now forced to do, and 
will be forced to do what 
Is now prohibited. Abor- 
tion may well be compul- 
sory and pregnancy pro- 
hibited because of popu- 
lation problems. There 
have been recent instances 
(e,g. New York) where wel- 
fare mothers were told they 
could get an abortion only 
If they agreed to be steri- 
lized. When win womengo 
lized. When will women 
get to make a choice for 
themselves? 

Rather than either abor- 
tion or compulsory preg- 
nancy, I would much prefer 
a more enlightened edu- 
cation for both women and 
men, and Improved contra- 
ception. At present we have 
neither.

The I-PU COMMUNICATOR 



September 1, 1972 



Student Services 



I-PU to have unified admissions, registration 



An interview with Dr. John P. 
Ulmer, Associate Dean for 
Student Services 



Q: What were the basic 
effects of last summer's 
merger of the Indiana Stu- 
dent Affairs Office and the 
Purdue Student Services 
Office? 

A; For the most part, 
the effect this past year 
waB one of organization 
and making plans for the 
future (or providing ser- 
vices of mutual benefit to 
both Indiana and Purdue 
students. 



Q: Did this unification pro- 
vide any tangible changes 
In services In this past 
year, or were these to 
come In the future? 
A: The functional bene- 
fits, that Is those which 
will have real Impact on 
students, will be seen this 
year and In future years. 



Q: Which services were 
studied during this past 
year? 

A: The Admissions Of- 
fice; Registrations pro- 
cess; and a University Di- 
vision Concept for both 
Universities. 



Q: What is the current 
status of the Unification 
Proposals? 

A: Effective this past July 
1, we entered the third 
phase of the Unifications 
Project, namely the Imple- 
mentation of the Study Pro- 
posals which took place this 
past year. Phase one, 
which occurred In July, 
1971, simply wasthe agree- 
ment in principle and or- 
ganizational structure to 
unify student services on 
this campus. Phase two, 
which took place through- 
out last year, was the ap- 
pointment of study com- 
missions to make recom- 
mendations for the unifi- 
cation of admissions, regi- 
stration, and counseling 
services. Phase three is 
the actual Implementation 
of the proposals which are ' 
following through at this 
rime. 



Q: Will phase three or the 
unification of each office 
occur all at once? 
A: No. Unified efforts in 
admissions will become 
fully operative beginning 
with this Pall Semester. 
For example, the Admis- 
sions staff will represent 
both universities in high 
school visitations and high 
school relations. We are 
developing a single unified 
admissions application and 
while students will still 
be admitted to either In- 
diatia or Purdue, their ad- 



missions application will 

be processed by a central 
office for next year's en- 
tering students. The im- 
plementation of the sec- 
ond study proposal, that 
of a unified "university 
division" concept serving 
both universities. Is being 
implemented immediately. 
The newly named Academic 
Development and Counsel- 
ing Division will service 
both Indiana and Purdue 
students who have unde- 
clared majors or who have 
been temporarily admitted 
to one or the other uni- 
versity. There will need 
to be further study made 
this year of the unification 
of the registration offices 
before total implemen- 
tation can take place In 
this area. 



Q: When do you antici- 
pate having a single reg- 
istration process? 

A: HopefuUy by the Fall 
of 1973. This area Is more 
difficult to unify simply 
because we must Interact 
with twosystem-wldecom- 
puter and record-keeping 
systems. Additionally, 

data processing require- 
ments and capabilities 
must be carefully con- 
sidered In effecting a com- 
mon registration system. 



Q; Will there be an ad- 
vanced registration for 
both universities? 
A: A student-faculty -ad- 
ministrative reglatrailon 
committee will be ap- 
pointed within the next 
month to deal with this kind 
of question. My hope Is 
that we can take the t&gt;est 
procedures from both sys- 
tems and modify these pro- 
cedures to meet the unique 
needs of our Fort Wayne 
campus. 



f^ do you feel confidant 
that the parent campuses 
will accept a new system? 
A: Yes, I am very con- 
fident of this. We have 
had a lot of interacting 
with both parent campuses 
this past year. I feel cer- 
tain that officials at both 
main campuses recognize 
that the Fort Wayne situ- 
ation is unique and thai we 
do have their support In 
devising a system to meet 
our local situation. 



Q: What is tbe possi- 
bility of a student being 
admitted as a student of 
Indiana- Purdue University 
at Fort Wayne"? 





Dean Ulmer discusses changes in Student Services, 



A: This has been dis- 
cussed In the past. This 
concept will have to await 
greater autonomy than we 
now presently have. If tor 
example, we were Indeed 
Indiana-Purdue University 
at Fort Wayne serving the 
greater northeast area 
greater northeast area of 
Indiana, thenstudentscould 
be admitted to the Indiana- 
Purdue University at Fon 
Wayne. What the Com- 
mission on Higher Educa- 
tion is going to decide rel- 
ative to a master plan for 
higher education In the 
State of Indiana obviously 
will serve as a mandate 
for the direction our cam- 
pus will follow In terms of 
fiscal, academic, and ad- 
ministrative autonomy. 



q; do you feel that a com- 
mon admissions applica- 
tion and unified admissions 
office operation will help 
eliminate the confusion 
caused now by each institu- 
tion having designated aca- 
demic mission assign- 
ments? 

A: Yes, I think it will 
definitely help. Students 
will still be free to choose 
the Instliulon of their 
choice Irrespective of aca- 
demic mission assign- 
ments, however, entering 
students will be advised 
that if it Is their Intent to 
complete a degree at the 
Fort Wayne Campus in a 
given field, then they should 
enter the Instltulon which 
has that academic mission 
assignment. If, however, 
' the student plans to com- 



plete his degree at ano- 
ther campus, then his only 
concern need by the resi- 
dency requirements on the 
campus where helntendsto 
complete his degree. In- 
diana students (and Purdue 
students respectively) en- 
rolled in an academic mis- 
sion assigned to Purdue 
(Indiana University res- 
pectively) shall be notified 
periodically In writing that 
If they have changed their 
minds and do plan to remain 
on the Fort Wayne campus 
to complete their degrees, 
then they should transfer 
to the instliuion author- 
ized to grant the degree in 
their chosen area. This 
reminder should help eli- 
minate situations wherein 
students accumulate 80 to 
90 hours and then sudden- 
ly realize that they are 



enrolled In the wrong in- 
stitution for the degree goal 
they are seeking If they 
Intend to remain In Fort 
Wayne for their degree. 
When this happens, stu- 
dents face the possibility 
of losing substantial cred- 
it In thelnsiliutlonal trans- 
fer process because of the 
large number of hours they 
-have accumulated. We plan 
have accumulated. We also 
plan In the future to make 
an Internal Institutional 
transfer as simple as pos- 
sible for students on this 
campus.

SlEilng here amid&amp;t all 
IhlB clutter and confusion, 
I find myself (by stirring 
through the rubble and 
looking closely) wondering 
about the wandering waifs 
In the halls. They look so 
forlorn and lost that I[ 
Beenns a shame someone 
doesn't take them by the 
hand and show them the way 
around. And that's Just the 
seniors; the Ireshmen are 
those pillars of salt who 
JUBt stand staring with 
those big, Innocent &lt;heh, 
heh), and trusting eyes 
waiting tor someone -any- 
one - to smile and say hi. 

The first big hurdle has 
been passed - registration 
Is history now. All that 
remains Is to walk Into 
the classroom with chose 
strange people: two eyes 
per person; and they are 
all trained on the poor un- 
fortunate who dares to be 
late. What a nice day to 
have stayed in bed. 

But, there are really 
some pleasant experiences 
In store for everyone. You 
will learn an awful lot while 
on campus. The only 
trouble IsthatcLassesmusi 
periodically be attended In 
order to pacify that other 
lost breed, the Faculty, You 
can always tell the Faculty; 
but you can't tell them 
much. 

If you are one of those 
who Is completely con- 
fused, absolutely lost, and 



perk up. You probably be- 
long In Student Govern- 
ment. If you are In that 
condition and unable to ar- 
ticulate your woes to the 
rest of the world, we could 
probably flndaplaceforyou 
on the Communicator staff. 
If you are one of the above, 
both of the above, or none 
of the above, you have 
wasted enough time reading 
this. 

However. If you insist on 
going on, I'll try to tell 
you a bit more about the 
good places to go. Have 
you tried the cafeteria? 
That is where theactlonls. 
All the gut reaction Issues 
are thoroughly digested 
and, carrying our analogy 
forward to Its logical con- 
clusion, wecQild suggest 
that the end products are 
fairly comparable onet o 
the other. 

But enough of politics 
(and who hasn't had enough) 
we should really concen- 
trate on what I have been 
leading up to — the con- 
clusion. Welcome toa- 
nother semester of what- 
ever you make of it.

very mature, have a great 
comaraderle, and also are 
working for a common 
good."

You've come a long way, 
Alphal From a local or- 
ganization chanered in 
1966 to a National Greek 
Sorority to be pledged Oc- 
tober 7. 1972. Through 
the years. Alpha Psl O- 
mega has been a very ac- 
tive local chapter, partl- 
clpltatlng In school acti- 
vities, f und raising and 
charity projects to name 
a few. We've also Joined 
with other Creeks on our 
campus and at other local 
colleges sponsoring and 
participating in many as- 
sorted activities. 

Some of the projects that 
we participate In and spon- 
sor include; Penny Car- 
nival: last year's booth, 
"Pumpkin Patch," won us 
the trophy for best overall 
booth. The booth Included 
different games revolving 
around a Halloween-type 
theme which the children 
from State School, from 
various children's hones 
and from the community 
found most enjoyable. 

Winter Carnival: con- 
sists of dances, snow scul- 
ptures and winter games 
which provide competition 
and relaxation for all or- 
ganizations and In which 
we always enter and at- 
tend. Last year's apple 
snow sculpture won the 
trophy for Most Original 
Sculpture (how can you lose 
with only two sculptures 
entered I). 

Harbararbar Days: this 
is a big weekend on campus 
and we enjoy participating 
in as many acilvllles as 
possible for both fun and 
prizes. The weekend In- 
cludes a concertand dance, 
a road rally ( some people 
can miss pan ofthecourse 
and still "win the Powder 
Puff Rally), gamesandcon- 
tests (It's fun getting 
knocked off a greased log 
into the mud or being 
drug through mud In the 
tug-o-war o r n ci rn&gt; ving 
quick enough as an egg 
comes sailing through the 
air), a float regatta 
(wher e your float wins 
the Most Creative Trophy, 
even though your liabyduck 
will only lay on Us side 
in the water Instead of 
floating behind Its mother) 
and an afternoon of rock 
music and free food. 

Other various activities 
last year found the Alphas 
washing cars, baklngcook- 
les, brownies, and other 
good munchies for many 
bake sales, giving tours 
for visiting groups on cam- 
pus, sponsoring a garage 
sale, working onchildren's 
day at the Fine Ans Fes- 
tival, participating In the 
Three Rivers Festival, 
and helping a Tech frat- 
ernity at Greek Week on 
their campus. Besides 
all our projects, weal- 



ber panies, get-togethers, 
parties, and ust a 1 ct of 
fun. 

This year has started 
us off and running with 
working at frediran or- 
ientation and sponsoring a 
bake sale on the first day 
of school. The month's 
activities win get into full 
swing as we plan rush, a- 
iong with the other two 
campus sororities, and 
help with the "Book Walk" 
to move the library on Sep- 
tember 20. Plans for rush 
are still being finalized for 
mid-September and we 
hope 10 see many of you at 
our rush functions. This 
semester you will find us 
working on many of the 
above projects and helping

Music notes 



Boz Scaggs 
My Time 



by Dave Hill 



Boz Scaggs? who's he? 
That's Che reaction mosr 
people give upon being 
asked t o Identify Mr. 
Scaggs. 

No, he's not your local 
garbage man. or a char- 
acter on the Beverly Hill- 
billies. Actually, he Is 
a very talented guitarist 
and songwriter, whom 
Sonne of you nay remem~ 
ber from the Steve Miller 
Band of a couple of years 
ago. Since leaving Steve 
Miller. Boz has been doing 
some very 1 nterestlng 
things. 

"My Time" is his fourth 
album, and third on the 
Columbia label. Obvious- 
ly, the albums have not 
sold too well, because Boz 
Scaggs Is not exactly a 
household word.3 

Tbe music Boz produces 
Is well worth listening to. 
He always surrounds him- 
self with an outstanding 
bunch of musicians, as Is 
evidenced by the presence 
of such people as Duane 
Allman, Rita CooUdge, and 
Ben Sldran on his earlier 
albums. 

During the course of 
the four albums he has 
releaeed, Boz has de- 
developed an excremelydi- 
silnctlve style. Consequenr 
ly, it isdlfflculciodescrlbe 
bis music to someone who 
hasn't heard It. He has 
taken the best dements 
from many different types 
of music, and connblned 
them t o form music that 
Is very enjoyable to lis- 
ten to, Heeffectlvelycom- 
blnes a big t&gt;and sound with 
the basic elements of rock 
music. 

There are ten songs on 
tbe album, six of which 
were recorded at Muscle 
Shoals Sound Studios in 
Alabama. Of late It has 



become fashionable in the 
music world for everybody 
and tils brother to record 
a Country- Western album, 
and Muscle Shoals has be- 
come the place to go to do 
it. But surprisingly, the 
six cuts done at Muscle 
Shoals show much less of 
a Country-Western influ- 
ence than most of the mu- 
sic Boz has previously 
done. (His first album was 
all done at Muscle Shoals, 
and vraa definitely C&amp;W). 
Side one opens with a 
song entitled "Dinah Flo," 
a light, bouncy tune that 
Includes most of the dis- 
tinguishing characteristics 
In all of Boz's music. The 
born section Is prominent- 
ly featured, along with 
some sparkling piano play- 
ing. The background vo- 
cals on this song, and the 
whole album, are great- 
sounding. Boz does the 
lead vocals on all of the 
songs. At times the way 
he phrases his words and 
the nasal quality of his 
voice sound like Van Mor- 
rison. 

The two songs that stand 
out from the others are 
"Old Time Lovln'" and 
"Full Lock Power Slide." 
"Old Time Lovln'" Is a 
slow song chat opens with 
some "churchy" organ. 
Boz then begins singing, 
and Ills words and the nasal 
and his words are echoed 
by what sounds like a gos- 
pel choir. The effect leaves 
you looking aroundfor the 
revival tent at the end of 
the song. 

"Full Lock Power Slide" 
Is the only real "rocker" 
on the album. Boz starts 
out with some guliarchords 
that sound like they're

In viewing 

'The Candidate'- satire 
of Anerican politics 



Page9 



by Liz Schevtchuk 



Focusing on the intri- 
cate machinery and manu- 
veurings that are at the 
care of modern political 
campaigns, Warner Bro- 
thers' glassy film, "The 
Candidate" attempts tode- 
tall the processes of a 
media-centered election In 
all Its glory and grime. As 
the story unfolds, young. 
Idealistic Legal Aid Law- 
yer BillMcKayisgroomed, 
tutored, reheased, and 
primed to f^uccesdully 
compete for the Senate 
from California againstthe 
Incumbenc Senator, who Is 
an older, conservative pa- 
tron of middle America, 
Crocker Jarmon. 

Promised that he can 
be his own nan, In con- 
trol of his campaign, say- 
ing and doing as he Is In- 
clined, McKay's shaky ear- 
ly endeavours to maintain 
some reins of command 
over hishardened, polished 
campaign manager, Mar- 
vin Lucas and the closely 
allied master of contrived 
campaign a dv ertlslng, 
Howard Klein soon evapor- 
ates. 

Through Incrductlon to 
the behind the sceneselec- 
tloneerlng dominated by the 
all-powerful dictates of 
Lucas and Klein, McKay is 
rudely re-acquainted with 
the political facts of life 
against which he revolted 
as the son of a powerful 
politician Wio Isalsoa 
former governor of the 
state. 

"Come back in a week 
and see how I sold you," 
Klein glibly assures Mc- 
Kay at the beginning of the 
campaign. Just how mic h 
of a business in which the 
party sells the candlate to 
the buying electorate Is 
suddenly all too apparent 
to McKay who reallzesthac 
his Initial statements of 
belief must besxrlflced 
to cater to the whlmsof the 
ever-changing electorate, 
McKay's struggle to vage 
a two-fold battle against 
his own advisors who sche- 
dule and structure his ev- 
ery action until he feels 
as if his entire being has 
been super Imposed upon 
the Image projected by the 
party as well as his con- 
stant fight against oppo- 
nent Jarmon -constitutes 
the main theme of the mo- 
vie. 

"The Candidate," while 
not an exceptionally block- 
busting film. Is one which 
makes several well-placed 
points on the absuridltles 
and excesses which have 
become part and parcel of 
a 20lhcencury election. The 
constant enphasls o n 
"seU, sell, seU!" the 
strain of the continuous 
drive to defeat the oppo- 
nent, the never-ening 
role playing, is the per- 
sonality who can out-talk. 



out-smile, out -handshake, 
and out-campaign the other 
candidate are aptly por- 
trayed. Backroom poli- 
tics and smoky-filled 
strategy aestons. dl of 
the gllnering hoop-la of 
the big name fund raising 
dinners, the exhilaration of 
the ticker tape parade, the 
mental dilemmas of the 
candidate forcedt orecon- 
clte his position with his 
father and confronted by a 
wife who a ppears to be 
more in love with the con- 
cept of her husband as the 
glamorous potential sena- 
tor than she is with her 
husband as the man he is, 
are all objects of scrutiny 
under the film's cameras. 
Exposing poltlcls as It 
should be exposed more 
often, "The Candidate" Is 
not a perfect film. Char- 
acterization may appear to 
be weak at times, aso ne 
wonders whether a lawyer 
as Idealistic and gifted as 
McKay allegedly is could 
make some of the mis- 
taks 

takes he makes in the 
course of his campaign. 
Yet McKay's naive errors 
only serve to underscore 
one of the main premises 
of the film - that of the 
Irony of choosing a can- 
didate on nnore of a basis 
of his charlsmaandpopu - 
lar appeal than demon- 
'Scrated qua Ufi cations. As 
in a real election, the film 
closes as the polls are 
counted, the pollsters are 
proven Incorrect, the re- 
turns are tabulated and the 
"good guy" has won -or 
so it seems. The audience 
la left with the doubt that - 
the "good mai " has In- 
deed won - or whether or 
not there can even be a 
"good man" In anelectlon. 
Hence, the candidate Is a 
worthwhile film. It re- 
frains from the error of 
over-piaylng its theme and 
states much in what Is left 
unsaid; it doesn't preach.

U^. ehows strength in Olympics 



ABC coverage of (he Sum- 
msr Olympics In Munich 
has been great, American 
viewers are geltlng a good 
look at all the events, and 
the explanations given {as 
to scoring, rules, etc) have 
been, vrith a few exceptions, 
all chat one could want. 
Much of the exposure has 
been given, of course, to the 
American athletes, but so 
far they've earned It, 
Through Tuesday, the 
U.S. had captured 15 medals 
In out-distancing second 
place East Germany and 
third place Soviet Union, 
who had garnered elghtand 
seven medals respectively, 
Mark Spitz la living up 
fully to hie press notices 
and also Is redeeming him- 
self for his failures In 
Mexico In 1968, It looks 
like nothing can stop him 
from attaining his unbe- 
lievable goal of no less than 
seven golds. 

Super heavyweight wrest- 
ler Chris Taylor was the 
victim of what must be one 
of the all-time hean- 
breaklng Incidents In the 
Olympics. Last Sunday 
he lost by one point to 
the world champion, Alex- 
ander Medved of Che Soviet 



Union. Soonatcerche match 
it was found that the 400- 
pound (I) macman had been 
penalized unfairly twice by 
a judge from Turkey. 

It is reported that twice 
the Russian backed away 
from hie opponent (Taylor) 
enough to Incur a penalty 
point. But each Clme Tay- 
lor also was given a pen- 
alcy point for backing a- 
way. Replay films showed 
clearly that Taylor was 
not guilty of the infrac- 
tions. The Turkish Judge 
was Immediately sent 
packing.,, but the defeat 
unjustly hung on Taylor 
stood, 

Vic Auer knows what it 
feels like for Taylor. The 
35-year-old markman was 
listed as the leader for 
two hours in the small 
fore rifle shoot from the 
prone position. But then 
the Judges changed their 
scoring and awarded the 
gold medal to a North Ko- 
rean. The way he took 
this Information ... "Sure, 
I'm disappointed," Auer 
said, "But I am still 
pleased, I think I rep- 
resented my country well." 
Right on, fella. 



Pro football in the Summit City? 



Professional football Is 
returning to Fort Waynel 
a three-man corporation 
known as Champion Sports 
Production, Inc., reported- 
ly bought a franchise In the 
Midwest Professional 

Football League two weeks 
ago and Is planning to es- 
tablish a team In this city 
next year. A major hur- 
dle, though, Immed lately 
appears In this venture: 
where will the fledgling 
club play? 

A do-or-dte test may 
come October 21, whs nan 
MPFL football game be- 
tween Detroit and Indiana- 
polls Is sdiediled lobe 
played in none other than 
Fort Wayne, Indiana, The 



only possible location for 
this contest! hat comesto 
mind now Is ZoUner Sta- 
dium, home of the Ill-fated 
Fort Wayne Warriors d 
1965. But Fritz Steger of 
Indianapolis, the head of 
the "corporation," vow 
to play the gameon Main 
Street If necessary. 

The 1972 MPFL loop 
consists of ^Ixteams: 
Indianapolis, Detroit, Co- 
lumbus, Youngstown, Flint 
and Lansing, Fort Wayne 
and Charleston, W Va., 
are to round out an eight- 
team 1973 league. 

And what will the new team 
be called? Steger: "The 
fort Wayne C hamplons. 
And I Intend to make them 
Just that."

The first full-time pub- 
lic relations director of 
the Fort Wayne Komets Is

be telecast Monday night

the National Hockey League 
will be attempting to prove 
once and for all that Can- 



ada 18 THE world pace- 
setter In hockey. Canadian 
born athletes, of course, 
owe much Co Che Unlced
