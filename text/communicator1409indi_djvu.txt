"In PIT'S 'Dark of the Moon,' director and 
choreographer Larry Life pulls out all Ihe 
stops . . . the show stands flawless. Every 
performance, from the lead to the anonymous 
mountain folk, provides an example of good 
acting in difficult roles. The 27-person 
cast provides character portrayals that rival 
Hollywood's best. But Life's biggest directorial 
stamp came with a stomp — the dancing. He 
decided to make the music and the dance an 
intricate — not a supplemental — part of 
the show. By this decision, the avant-garde 
director provides a masterful showcase to 
present the entire spectrum of theatre."
