On a college campus, inieiper-

issues gelling in the way." said 
Parrish-Sprowl. 

Parrish-Sprowl said he was 
aware Springfellow and Powers had 
been doing research related to racial 
issues arising in the classroom 
between students and teachers 

The research began as a 
response to siiuations Ihey have 
seen occur in the classroom. 

"A studeni may claim I 
received a low grade, because I 
am African-American,'" said 
Parrish-Sprowl. 

The lecture does not suggest 
how to avoid these situations but 
rather how lo re.&gt;;pond in such 



charges. 

The lopic is not enclusively tar- 
geted to teachers nor minorities. 

"Any student might 
work in a situation where 
this arises." said Parrish- 
Sprowl. 

Analysing diversiiy through ihe 
view of cultural differences is the 
focus of Ihe lecnire to be given in 
Walb Union Ballroom later in ihe 
week. 

On March 1. Andrew Moemeka. 
the chair of communication at 
Central Connecticut Stale 
University, will be comparing the 
way societies are organized in his 
lecture "Communalism: A 
Fundamental Dimension of 
Culture " 



Al noon, Moemeka will discuss 
differing impacts individualism and 
communalism have on human rela- 
tionships The U.S.. an individualist 
society which emphasizes pergonal 
gains and effons of the self, will be 
compared with s(x:ieiies of commu- 
nalism. Communalist societies 
value working collaboratively and 
adhere to support and loyally to the 
community. Japan is an example of 
this system. 

"By understanding commu- 
nalism, maybe we could adapt 
some of iheir ways to improve 
our interpersonal relationships." 
said Parrish-Sprowl.

Lasi week, more than 500 pages ol newly released documents 
showed Clinion had direct involvement with pnvaie "coffees" and 
overnight stays for potential donors. The documents also suggested 
drawing up a list of potential donors and invitees who had contributed 
S50.000 or more lo Ihe Democratic National Party (DNP) 

The list of 938 Lincoln bedroom guests showed they gave SIO mil- 
lion lo ihe DNP It included an assortment of Arkansas friends, execu-

This is also an ideal lime for 
students to discuss block booking

"It's hard getting people to be

During Diversity Week, SAB 
will co-sponsor a performance 
entitled "Miz Wizard's Science 
Secrets." The event is written and 
performed by Jane Cuny. 

"It's a one-person show," said 
Jacobs. "It teaches how women 
have had an impact on science," 

Curry is an author, storyteller, 
performer and "recovering acade-

with the Minnesota Chautauqua 
and performs nationally and inter- 
nationally with three other solo 
shows she has written.

Mujic tsllj African-American stery 



by Jeremy Ecenbarger 

"i don't wanna Tight for ihc 
prt:stigc, not for mc. Bui lo uplifi my 
iilllc brolheri who are sleeping on 
concrete floors today in America, 
black people wbo are livin' on wel- 
fare, black people who can't eat, 
black people who don'i know 
knowledge ot lhcmM:lvcs, black 
people wbo have no future," said 
Muhdnunad Ali. 

These words by ibc boxer stan 
the powerful and fascinating 
rhythms of the CD. "When We 
Were Kings," 

"When We Were Kings" is an 
interesting account of the epic 
"RumMe in the Jungle," the bosmg 
match, in Zaire, between Ali and the 
then seemingly invincible 
Heavyweight Champion of the 
World, George Foreman Ali 
knocked Big George out in the 15th 
round. 

rhc CD IS a soundtrack of the 
movie of ihe same utie, being 
released in selected theaters across 
the nation ihis month. The film is 
directed by Leon (jast, who, in 
1974, roamed the training camps of 
the two boxers with a 16 mm cam- 
era. The resulting fooiage (freed 
from Ltigation after 21 years) and 
(he interviews Gast gathered 
amount to more that a simple box- 
ing documentary 

The movie is a closeup of a bold 
All and a moment in the African- 
Amencan cultural resurgence 



Not only had Don King con- 
jured up enough money to promote 
the fighi, but he was also able lo 
stage a musical extravaganza often 
billed as the Alrican Woodstock 
Numeroas Afncan-Amencan anists 
were on hand to keep the pul.se rate 
of Za^e raang 

The soundtrack contains three 
new songs recorded specifically for 
the film, plus a number of stellar 
performances culled from the festi- 
val. With a mix of several styles of 
music, listeners are sure to find 
something they enjoy 

The first single is a hip-hop. rap 
tribute to Ah, the original rapper, 
called "Rumble in the Jungle" by 
ibe Fugees, featuring ATribe Called 
Quest and Busia Rhymes &amp; Forte 
The track should be showing up in 
the hip-hop community and beyond 

The two other songs are also 
outstanding The first is the title 
(rack "When Wc Were Kings." a 
smooth, powerful duet by Brian 
McKnighi and Diana King 

The second is Tm Calbng (Say 
It Loud)." a dance track by ex-C&amp;C 
Music Factory singer/performer 
Zelma Davis The song mixes 
African chants with strong, dance- 
type rfaythms 

Highlights of the other tracks 
include a live version of the R&amp;D 
classics "Ain't No Suashine" by Bill 
Withers. "Funky Good Tune" by 
James Brown and "Til Be Around" 
by the Spinners 

Several of All's notonous sound 
byte "raps" are interspersed between 




the track-s as well TTiere are also 
several tribal chants sprinkled 
throughout "When We Were Kings " 
The many quotes and cbanis 
between the music are what really 
bring the CD together.

Pentagon 
conspiracy: 

No justice for Gulf veterans 




The Peniagon — one of ihc most 
secure inslituLions in ihe world — 
ama/ingly enough claims Ihal all 
chemical -warfaie logs from ihe 
Gulf War have diiappearcd. The 
chemical -warfare logs provided 
informalion regarding any account 
of chemical or biological weapons 
detected on ihe batilcficld during 
[he 1991 Persian Gulf War- 
records that were instrumental 
in dciermining what caused 
"Gulf War syndrome " 

Give us a break. 
Are we to believe 
that ihis is a mis- 
take? Thai all 
copies — stored in I 
safeS' — in two dif- 
ferenl locations jusi 
disappeared- We 
Ihink not. Everyone 
should lake offense lo 
the irresponsible, obviou: 
cover-up by the defense 
department. 

Conveniently enough, ihe 
defense department has relieved 
itself of any knowledge of the 
effects on soldiers when our troops 
blew up an Iraqi munitions depot 
thai may have contained ions of 
nerve gas and other chemical 
weapons. 

Although there is no evidence 
thai Ihe soldiers were sickened by 
exposure to such chemicals, it is 
evident now we may never know 
Our soldiers risked their lives going 
to war to defend our country and 
now our defense department ha.s 

Cloning: 

It's just wrong 



refused to recognize their suffering 
by what we believe lo be a con- 
scious decision lo deslroy Lhe infor- 
mation that could have helped 
explain it all. 

The Pentagon has admitted that 
soldiers may have been exposed to 
nerve gas when they destroyed lhe 
munitions depot in 1991 To add 
salt 10 the wound, ihe soldiers were 
not even lold that the depot 
may have contained 
hemical weapons. 
The Pentagon has 
played Russian 
roulette with the 
lives of soldiers 
and ought lo be 
held responsi- 
ble for the 
abhorrent, and 
possibly criminal 
acts. 
As a country, wc 
should feel cheated and 
deceived by lhe defense depan- 
mcni. We should be outraged that 
ihey thought so little of the 
American people dial Ihey thought 
we would buy their story. Are we 
dumb enough lo think anything 
other ihan the obvious? If lhe 
Pentagon knowingly destroyed 
information regarding chemical 
and biological weapons exposed lo 
our soldiers, a deep and probing 
investigation must lake place of the 
Pentagon and they ought to be held 
responsible for their abhorrent, ille- 
gal and deceitful acts. They can no 
longer be trusted. 



!l is like some bad science-fic- 
lion movie. Taking a cell from an 
animal and creating an exact replica 
of the donor. The eventual outcome 
of Ihis experiment could be quiie 
scary. The recent cloning of a sheep 
has brought with it disturbing ques- 
tions for the human race. 

Is the nexi step cloning humans? 
We think it mosi certainly is 
Technology will surpass any doubts 
some have of this process — as it 
always has. Is it ethical to clone 
humans? No, Proponents of cloning 
say it will benefit human life, while 
opponents say il is unethical. We 
agree with the latter, it is simply 
unethical to clone humans. 

The Scottish scientists who 
cloned a sheep say geneiicaJly engi- 
neering animals will produce pro- 
teins for treating human diseases. 
Some believe the cloning of animals 
will benefit humans by fighting dis- 
eases, infenihty and animal extinc- 
tion. 

That is not the point.. The point 
is that if we believe it to be accept- 
able to clone animals (for any rea- 
son) we must n;luctantly accept the 



nexi step — thai of cloning humans. 

Why would anyone want to 
clone humans? To m^e Ihem organ 
farms? All things must come and go 
and if we allowed scientists lo clone 
humans we would be asking for 
trouble of an unimaginable magni- 
tude. We would be creating 
"humanoids." Cloning is the most 
incomprehensible, greedy and offen- 
sive act we could do to the human 
race. It is wrong to create quasi- 
humans for any purpose. 

The ^plication of this experi- 
ment to human life reflects the 
demise of social morality. Lefs con- 
sider the benefiLs: organ transplants 
on call, matching blood, healthy 
cells, etc. The cloning of humans for 
any purpose is without a doubl 
wrong. 

When scieniisLs decide to con- 
tinue their research on humans, they 
are invading sacred territory, 
individuality will no longer exist. 
Genetically creating identical beings 
is just unethical. 

Obviously proponents of 
cloning have been watching too 
much Star Trek.

TV rating system is beneficial 



The new television rating sys- 
tem should be familiar to everyone 
by now. The TV-Y, TV-PG, TV-14 
and TV-M, is supposed lo help par- 
ents decide if a show is appropriate 
for iheir children. 

In the old days monitoring what 
children watched was called parent- 
ing. Today, in the husUe and bustle 
of the high-icch '90s, children can't 
be raised without the help of 
Congressmen and advisers. (Does 
anyone really want Congressman's 
help in raising theu- kids? Have you 
ever seen Jesse Helms? The 
"Rugrals" would have Yerile the 
Turtle nightmares for weeks.) 

Well, the television rating sys- 
tem came under fire in Washington 
last week. Children's advocacy 
groups, along with legLslators, called 
for lhe current system to be 
replaced. In it's place, they wanted a 
content specific warnings in case a 



show contained violence, nudity or 
aduU language. In support of iheir 
point, they showed Phoebe on 
"Fnends," a TV-PG show using the 
word "bastard." 

Television industry representa- 
tives asked thai the curreni system, 
only a few months old, be given a 
second chance. They said the system 
should be kept in place at least until 
the V-chip becomes readily avail- 
able. The V-chip will be placed in all 
new televisions, allowing parents lo 
block oul channels. 

This is all great! Let's ban guns 
on TV. but not in real life! Clearly, 
TV sex and violence is the cause of 
great concern. Our legislators are 
experts when it comes to both sex 
and violence, so if they're worried, 
we all should be. 

TV violence is an easy target. 
History has shown that the Vikings 
would never have invaded Europe if 
il wasn't for the comipting influence 
of "Married Wiih Children." Idi 
Amin had a complete "Mighiy 



Morphin' Power Rangers" videotape 
collection. 

Are there really thai many 3rd- 
graders who are die-hard "NVPD 
Blue" fans? Because I get the feeling 
that none of the Nazi-soccer moms 
on these child advocacy groups have 
ever asked a kid what they watch or 
know, I learned from my parents, in 
trafTic. as God intended. 

1 do underMand that lechnology 
has made n harder lo be a parent. 
The problem is that most 8-year-olds 
usually have a better grasp of tech- 
nology than Mom and Dad, When 
little Johnny is lhe only one in the 
family who can program a VCR. is it 
going 10 be much of a problem for 
him to get around the V-chip. 

Would a content based system 
be better? Absolutely noi. All label- 
ing a show for V violence or N for 
nudily would do is aci as a guide for 
what shows are "didy " I am sur- 
prised that the TV industry is fight- 
ing it. The ratings for such a show 
would be through the roof. 



Parking policy makes sense

Chief of Police 

The curreni proposal to do away 
with "B" parking permits and 
charge students a fee per credit hour 
for parking has many benefiis. 
Students cunently pay a flat rate of 
S2S for a "B" parking permit. Next 
year the rate will be $34 for the 
same permit All students pay lhe 
same price regardless of whether 
they lake one class or five classes. 

Under the new proposal, siu-

credii hour fee to replace the flat 
rale fee. In general, the amount of 
time a student spends on campus is 
directly relaied to the number of 
classes Ihey are taking. So. it makes 
sense for a student who takes 16 
hours to pay more than the student 
who takes three hours. Some stu- 
dents will pay more, bui, many will 
pay less than the current flat rate. 

The parking fees are used to 
maintain the parking lots, roadways 
and to pay the debt ser\'ice on the 
current and upcoming parking 
garages. All students, even if they 
do not drive to school, benefit and 
use these faciUties in one way or 
another. 

There are many benefits in 
doing away with the current "B" 
permits. IPFW hosts many special 
events that are open to the pubhc. 



We have athletic events, lectures, 
PIT productions and more. Each 
semester the number of special 
events increase. During many of 
these special events, parking 
enforcement must be suspended to 
allow visitors lo campus to park 
without receiving a ticket. Under 
the new proposal, "B" lots would 
not require Ihat a permit be dis- 
played and visitors could park in 
these areas wiihout a permit 
(Permits would still be required in 
"A" lots) These visitors would be on 
campus anyway, Ihey would just be 
making the campus easier for them 
to come and visit Many of these 
visitors to campus are poieniial stu- 
dents. The perception they get of 
our campus is crucial to our contin- 
ued growth.

Thai is the beauty of TV. Il is 
very democratic. Popular shows stay 
on the air. Shows no one watches gel 
canceled. If people were not inter- 
ested in sex and violence, there 
would be no shows concerning 
them. 

So, why are TV ratings such a 
popular topic in Washington? 
Because it is very easy to take a 
stand on il. Members of both parties 
love to make speeches about defend- 
ing children from horrors of prime- 
time television. Who would be for 
TV violence? 

Well, 1 am I love il. I can't gel 
enough. I want to see the cast of 
"The Nanny" in a cage match with 
the cast of "Suddenly Susan." I want 
the "Road Rules" trailer strapped 
with explosives and driven through 
the "Real World" house. I want a 
plane carrying everyone on the WB 
neiwork to crash inio a plane carry- 
ing everyone on UPN. li would 
leave more room for quality televi- 
sion. 



lies witii multiple care have lo worry 
about switching permits from car lo 
car. This would eliminate tickets for 
"failure to display a permit." The 
number of appeals for this violation 
is very high, so this would lighten 
the load of the appeals board. You 
would no longer have to get a tem- 
porary permit for the day. because 
"B" permits would be eliminated. 
Police personnel could spend extra 
lime on crime prevention instead of 
parking enforcement The universi- 
ty would save dollars and time by 
not having lo purchase, issue and 
enter permit information for each 
student. 

The proposed policy makes 
sense in many ways. It saves time, 
money and promotes a friendlier 
atmosphere for studenis, staff, fac- 
ulty and visitors. 



Mulling it over: Scott Ward&amp;m 



Life's simple pleasures 




reached through simple, day-to-day 
pleasures. 

Not everybody can win lhe lot- 
tery, but we can all relish our little 
moments. We just have to recognize 
them when ihey appear, 

I've never really had a motto, 
but 1 don't ihink thai 1 could say it 
any better than when Ferns Bueller 
said. '"Life moves pretty fail. If you 
don't Slop and look around, you 
could miss il." 

Basically what I'm trymg to gel 
at is that it's the little things in life 
that we have to embrace. 

For example, how about ripping 
off CD clubs, one of my favorite 
things. Maybe lhe term "ripping 



off IS a little strong, so for the pur- 
pose of evading self-incriminaiion, 
we'lljuslcallil working the system. 

I mean really, what could be 
better than signing up with DMG or 
Columbia House and getting six or 
seven free CDs or whatever the 
number is, then signing up a fake 
brother and getting four CDs for 
signing him up. plus the ha!f-d02en 
or so that he gets for joining. 

Just don't get too carried away, 
because il can get a bit confusing 
after your imaginary friends and rel- 
atives Stan lo sign up people. 

Hopefully I'm not the only one 
who enjoys doing ihis, but if I am. 
disregard what you've just read. 

Anyway, I'm sure that there are 
a few more universal pleasures. We 
all enjoy finding money in a pair of 
jeans that we haven'i worn in a 
while or the smell of grandma's 
cooking. 

Some things jusI pui a smile on 
our face no matter what kind of 
mood we're in. 

For instance, we've all been 
speeding down the road minding 



our own business, when we see that 
a pohce officer has pulled over a fel- 
low moiorisi. Maybe you're at&gt;eiter 
person than I am and don't find this 
situation a bit amusing, bui I guess 
that il's just In my nature to laugh at 
the sight of someone, other than 
myself, in trouble with the law. 

I know that we were all taught at 
a young age noi to take pleasure 
from the misfonunes of others, hut 
really, why else would millions of 
Americas suffer through scores of 
Bob Saget jokes every week if Ihey 
didn't think that some poor schmuck 
was gonna get whacked in the groin 
by his golf-cluh-wielding son? 

Basically we Just need lo step 
away from the stress of classes once 
in a while and reali7£ thai we're all 
taking things way too seriously. 

At some point stop and smell 
the roses. BreaLbe the air and try to 
notice the little things in life ihal 
make you smile Just remember tiiai 
every situation can be funny, espe- 
cially if it's at someone else's 
expense.

March Madness highlights the year 




Spring is nearly upon u.s. and 
wiLh ii come birds singing, flowers 
blooming and rains falling Dul .sen- 
ously. no one really cares about thai 
stuff, do Uiey? 

More imporlanlly, the begin- 
ning or March brings the Madness 
(hat goes along wilh ii. which makes 
mc as happy as a 6-ycar-old boy in 
Wonkaland. The aniicipalion ot ihe 
second Sunday in the third month is 
• greater ihan waking up at 5 a.m on 
Christmas morning and waiting for 
ihe rest of the Tamily lo rise and 
shine. 

We all know what people say 
about March "It comes in like a 
lion and gws out like a lamb." Or at 



64 chosen ones — Ihe teams whose 
seasons will continue in the Big 
Dance, also known as the NCAA 
Basketball Tournament 

Christmas doesn't come close 
TTianksgiving. my binhday or even 
the Super Bowl can't even begin 
compare lo Selection Sunday 
Maybe I'm the only person who 
feels this way, but I'm pretty certain 
that it's the best day. and easily the 
best three weeks of the year You all 
might think thai I'm a pretty dis- 
turbed person to believe this, but I 
honestly do. 

After Sunday, we'll be enjoying 
24 days of pure bliss, and if you 



decide to cake my advice and camp 
out in front of the TV to watch the 
1 2 hours a day of coverage, you will 
reap the benefits and become a more 
culturally rounded person. 

Senously, the loumameni has 
all the excitement, drama and pa.S' 
sion as a James Bond movie — even 
one with Sean Connery 

Where else could a school such 
as South Central Dakota State come 
close 10 upsetting the Kenluckys 
iyid Kansases of the world? 

Maybe it's some sort of mental 
afriiction.but I assure you that I'm 
not alone in my love for — or 
should I say my obsession widi — 
March Madness 

Madness is such a perfect word 
to describe the melcc wc know sim- 
ply as, 'The Toumameni" After all, 
it is a synonym of insanity. 

It's nearly impossible not to get 
caught up in the intensity and pure 
passion that the Big Dance holds. 

Basically what I'm trying lo gel 
at is that nothing gives me as much 
joy as playing the rote of prognosii- 
cator. which is pretty sad when you 
think about il. but (nie nonetheless 

Those of you who know me, 
understand that I'm one of the most 
compeliUve people around, which 
drives me to hours upon hours of 



pouring over all 20 pages of statis- 
tics in USA Today All this simply to 
brag about picking the right upset.s 
and all four teams thai will make it 
to Indianapolis to participate m the 
seminnals, or more universally 
known as "The Final Four " 

Then again. Madness might not 
be all-encompassing enough to 
describe the momentous occasion 
We'll use hullabaloo, meaning 
chaotic. Because, really, what could 
be more so than 32 games in two 
action-packed days. 

The thing that makes the tourna- 
ment so great is that afler Indiana — 
my personal choice to win il every 
year — gels knocked oul, I'm not 
about lo commit suicide, because 
my affection for the toumameni 
actually transcends my love for lU 

What I love about March 
Madness is that everything 
stops, no matter how important 
Back at Woodlan High School, 
we would lake a break from the 
rigors of education and would 
all huddle around the TV to 
watch Ihe first-round games in 
our classrooms, And wc all 
wonder what's happening lo our 
education system 

I guess that some things are 
just a litile more imporiant.

Corrections: 

In the Feb 27 issue, Ihe results to the question "If a 
man or woman drinks and then has sex against their will, 
is Ihis rape?" in the graph titled "Results o( campus stu- 
dent survey on crime" were wrong. In actuality, 75 slu- 
denls responded "yes," while seven students said "no." In 
the Feb. 20 issue, George Kalamaras was incorrectly 
identified as an associate instructor of crealive writing He 
IS actually an associate professor. We apologize for any 
inconvenience these errors may have caused
