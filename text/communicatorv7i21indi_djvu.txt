COMMUNICATOR 



Announcing a new 
lU-Purdue program 
which trains you for 

management 
before you graduate 



Many jobs you'll find as a 
college graduate are designed to 
develop your basic management 
skills. And often require a year or 
more before you get any real 
supervisory responsibility. 

Army ROTC gives you your 
management training up front... 
while you're still in college. Then 
challenges you with instant respon- 
sibility in your first job as an Army 
officer. And starts you out at over 
$10,000 per year. 

And now, lU-Purdue offers you 
Army ROTC courses on campus. All 
current freshmen and sophomores 
are eligible. 

Sophomores: you must apply by 
April l for a special six-week 
summer program at Fort Knox, 
Ky., where you'll prepare, mentally 
and physically, for advanced ROTC. 



You'll earn over $500 while you're 
there. And incure no obligation until 
you register for ROTC in your junior 
year. It's then you start earning $100 
per month (up to 10 months per 
year) for your last two years at 
lU-Purdue. 

Freshmen: you can pre-register 
for ROTC this spring and double up 
on 1st and 2nd year courses next 
year. Again with no obligation until 
your junior year. 

Veterans: if you have two or 
more years of college remaining, 
you already qualify for advanced 
ROTC and may pre-register this 
spring. 

For details, see your academic 
advisor or contact Major Dick 
Reinholtz in Room 288F Neff Hall or 
call 482-5416.
