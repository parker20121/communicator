Kentucky Wesleyan offense by al- 



lowing 6 points in the first seven

IPSGA Student Senate says 
'yes' to fiscal autonomy 



IPSGA Student Senate passed a res- 
olution on Monday, Feb. 8, calling for 
"Fiscal Autonomy from Purdue 
Universiiy." 

Audiors are Rajai Suri, student body 
president; Elbert A, Webster, Stu- 
dent senate president; and Chris 
Douse, student senator. 

This legislation, important to 
every IPFW student, is reproduced 
in unedited form to inform the 
entire IPFW community. 

-Whereas IPFW is now a mature in- 
stitution with over 11.000 siudenis. 
offering more than 100 degree pro- 
grams, and supported by stale appro- 
priations totalling more than 
$25,000,000,00 (Twenty-five million 
dollars), and 

Whereas, Purdue University, as fis- 
cal agent for IPFW. has consistently 
penalized IPFW students by imposing 
unfair student participatory percent- 
ages (IPFW students, 44 percent; 
West Lafaycite students, 33 percent) 
for educational delivery costs, and 

Whereas, Purdue University has re- 
peatedly denied IPFW students equal 
protection from harassment or dis- 
crimination on the basis of sexual ori- 



entation, and 

Whereas, Purdue University has 
demonstrated irresponsibility and in- 
competence as fiscal Bgcni, by allow- 
ing die IPFW budget to remain below

Childcare Task Force 

Administrators debate issue 



ByFelldaBeechIng 
Editor In chief 

The Childcare Task Force listened 
to John Bickley, general director and 
CEO of the YMCA of greater Fort 
Wayne, propose possible solutions for 
IPFW's childcare woes. Bickley re- 
cendy came to Fort Wayne after suc- 
cessfully managing and operating 
latch-key. daycare, and drop-in 
babysitting programs for corpora- 
lions, local YMCA's, and elementary 
schools in Columbus. Ohio. 

Frank Borelli, vice-chancellor of 
student affairs, suggested dial a con- 
tractual agreement with a childcare 
provider might be die solution, but is 
hesitant about continuing funding for 
childcare with so many pressing 
needs on campus. 

"Childcare is not an eniiUemcni on 
IPFW's campus," stated Borelli, "On- 
ly a small percentage [of students) 
would use it. so we can't subsidize 



somediing diai few use." 

When The Communicator asked if 
this same logic carries over into fund- 
ing die athletic center where 50 per- 
cent of student services fees are con- 
sumed, but which 50 percent of sm- 
dents don't use, Borelli replied, "It's 
not die same.. .all students are able to 
use the athletic center, not all have 
children," 

Marian K, Zimmerman, dean of stu- 
dents, stated childcare is not an op- 
tion, but a need for IPFW students. 
She recalled that at one lime, she reg- 
ularly used university daycare provid- 
ed by IPFW. 

Zimmerman suggested that the solu- 
tion might be accomplished in stages; 
from limited toddler care the first 
year and grow into a more compre- 
hensive daycare program. 

"We are wresUing with a real dilem- 
ma." Zimmerman concluded. 

Task Force member Pearl Heath, 
visiung assistant professor of educa- 



tion said that she sees a need, 

"Parenis [without childcare) bring 
children to class in summer." Head) 
observed. 

The Task Force set a deadline of 
Friday, Febr^iary 19 for students to 
drop-off the Childcare Survey to 
Helmkc Library, Ketiler Hall Infor- 
mation Desk, or Career Services. The 
surveys are located on The Commu- 
nicator newsstands. 

Attending the meeting were Zim- 
merman; Borelli; Philip Eiavich. busi- 
ness administrator; Kimberly Mc- 
Donald, assistant professor of organi- 
zational leadership and supervision; 
Elbert Webster, student government 
representative; and guests Bickley 
and Don Keys, bodi from die YMCA.

Purdue President Steven C. Beering 
released a siaicmenl Monday, Febru- 
ary 8, prohibiting discrimination 
based on sexual orientation at West 
Lafayette. 

IPFW's student senate passed a res- 
olution over a year ago forbidding 
discrimination of the same kind; how- 
ever. Purdue University Trustees 
would not allow IPFW lo add dial to 
its student handbook. The reason 
given to IPFW student government 
and faculty was diis: West Lafayette 
had no such policy because it was not 
a protected status by federal law, so 
IPFW could have no such policy, 

Beering staled in his letter to all 
members of the Purdue communi- 
ty: "It is essential that Purdue 
Universiiy demonstrate its intellec- 
tual and ethical leadership by reaf- 
firming its strong position against 




Steven Beering 



discriminaiion..." 

"In the course of our recent discus- 
sions, proponents of amending Uni- 
versity policy have emphasized thai 
they seek no special pnvileges, but 
rather the assurance of equal protec- 



. To die extent the University's 
audiority can offer iu such protection 
now exists and includes prohibition 
of discrimination on the basis of sex- 
ual orientation," Beering said. 

Now dial it's 'unofTiaally" accepted 
at West Lafayette (because ihe Pur- 
due Board of Ttustecs refused to ap- 
prove sexual orientaiion as a prelect- 
ed status at West Lafayette), will 
IPFW be able lo adopt a similar 'un- 
ofTicial' stance? 

David McCants. IPFW acting vice- 
chancellor of acadonic affairs shared 
his dioughis. He said that die Purdue 
Board of Trustees wants die student 
guidelines to be m agreement with 
federal law. Currently sexual orienta- 
tion is not on die list. 

"Beering's statement is a reaffirma- 
tion of a policy commitment to pro- 
tect die sexual orieniaiion of individ- 
uals even though such protection has 
not been written into ihe student 
code," staled McCants.

comic under die Bobby Norfolk Re- 
vue in die mid-1970's, and as a play- 
wright and director with the St. Louis 
Repenory Thcarre, 

"He's not just a storyteller who sils 
and tells stories." said Janet Jordan, 
director of the Education Curriculum 
Lab. "He also does drama and mime. 
We give him a whole stage and he 
is Just wonderful — a captivating 
performer." 

Norfolk does more than emenain. 
according to Jordan. "When he lells 
folk tales, he talks about different 
versions (of die folktales) and dien he 
eticourages kids to go lo die library 
and get die books." 

Two morning performances on Fri- 
day. Feb, 12 at 9:00 and 10:30 are 
scheduled for approximately 1000 
fouidi and fifih graders tmm area ele- 
roemary schools. IPFW education 



students have volunteered lo help 
with the accommodations for the 
children. 

Norfolk is popular with people of 
all ages. 

"Last year Norfolk's morning per- 
formances were so popular with ihe 
students, thai they insisted their par- 
ents lake diem to die evening presen- 
tation," s^d Jordan. 

The Education Conference will also 
use die occasion to honor two IPFW 
alumni tor their contributions to the 
field of education. Wylie Sirk. ele-

STAFF EDITORIAL 



Anti-social atmosphere 
necessitates renovation 



The Green Room of our 
cafeteria requires a major ren- 
ovation. Few students would 
argue that ihe uncomfonablc 
seating, combined with the 
poor organization of the seat- 
ing itself, makes Ihc Green 
Room a very inconvenient 
place to socialize, much 
less eat. 

The poor se- 
lection of "en- 
tertainmcnl" 
provided by the 
Midday Diver- 
sion becomes 
quite tiresome. 
There is only so 
much folk mu- 
sic that the stu- 
dents on this 
campus can 
lake! Nomially 
the music is 
turned up so 
loud thai most 
normal conver- 
sation is impossible. It is little 
wonder that the smoking area 
becomes more popular on 
Monday afternoons. More va- 
riety in the entertainment 
would be a welcome addition. 

Those who complain about 
the problems in the smoking 
area should spend some time 
in the Green Room and stop 
complaining about Iheir area. 
The booths in the smoking 
area allow for easier conversa- 
tion than that in the green 




room. Privacy is also a major 
advantage of the smoking 
area, something that is com- 
pletely lacking in the Green 
Room. 
The tables in the Green 
Room look more like some- 
thing out of the 70s than a 
school of [he 90s. The utter 
lack of decora- 
lion makes the 
place look like 
a drab, uninvit- 
ing, boring 
place instead of 
the social galh- 
ering/study 
area it should 
be. 

Reserving ta- 
bles for the ad- 
ministration's 
conferences 
during the 
lunch break 
takes up space 
that the stu- 
dents need. Various groups 
reserving five or six tables for 
their use and then only using 
two or three is a major waste 
of student space. 
Non-smoking students seem 
to be getting the shaft when it 
comes to their eating area. 
The people in charge of this 
area should see that it is 
brought up to standards which 
appeal to students wants or 
else more students will go to 
TacoBeU for lunch. 



Smoking space ample 



It is almost universally ac- 
cepted that smoking is. at 
best, an unwise choice for an 
individual. We know that cig- 
arette smoke has been the 
cause of death for millions al- 
ready, and it continues to 
claim more lives everyday. 
Despite this knowledge and 
general agreement thereof, wc 
do not make laws prohibiting 
people from making the deci- 
sion to smoke. To do so 
would be a blatant 
regard for individual 
rights. 

Bui now. due to 
recent medical re- 
search, a new ele- 
ment has been intro- 
duced into the argu 
ment. It seems that ciga- 
rcne smoke is even harmful to 
ihc health of those who never 
light up. For this reason alone. 
it is reasonable to prohibit in- 
dividuals from smoking in 
public places in which non- 
smokers arc present. This was 
the apparent justification for 
the ban on smoking at Glen- 
brook Square. 

Now the question of whether 
to allow smoking in desig- 
nated areas of Walb Memo- 
rial Union Building becomes 




relevant. 
There arc currently two des- 
ignated smoking areas: the TV 
room in Walb and "The Dun- 
geon," also in Walb. It is un- 
derstandable that smoking 
should be prohibited in the 
TV room, as it is not enclosed 
and provides the only big 
screen TV on campus. How- 
ever "The Dungeon is a dif- 
ferent matter. 
"The Dungeon" is relatively 
iclosed and so con- 
tains the harmful 
smoke. It is also 
not the only room 
of its kind, as the 
non-smoking stu- 
dents can dine in 
The Green Room." 
Because "The Dungeon" 
offers nothing that a non- 
smoking student can't find 
elsewhere on campus, it 
should remain a designated 
smoking area. 
The question then becomes: 
should we allow students a 
place to smoke on campus if it 
doesn't harm non-smokers? 

Wc believe the answer must 
be yes, as it is a matter of per- 
sonal choice for ihe smoker, 
and not subject to governmen- 
tal restrictions. 







Letter to the editor 

Argument impaired by fallacies^ assumptions 



To the Editor: 

Logical faJlacics and faisc assump- 
tions mar the conciliatory pretense of 
Keiili Roman's Feb. 4 reply to my 
commentary tilled "Post Bom Mur- 
dered," Rornan noted that "anti-abor- 
tion" activists "are only a small seg- 
ment of the total Christian communi- 
ty"; he then cited a litany of Christian 
involvements and org^izaiions and 
faisely ascrit)ed 10 my commentary a 
claim that Christians fail lo perform 
the humanitarian work that is evi- 
denced by such Christian concerns. 

In assigning me this claim, Roman 
commitied a "strawperson fallacy." 
The text Writing Arguments: A 
Rhetoric with Readings notes that 
"In committing a strawperson fallacy, 
you basically make up the argument 
you wish your opfKinenis had made 
and attribute ii lo them because it's so 
much easier 10 refute than the argu- 
ment they act^ially made." 

Nowhere in the cornmentary which 
I wrote did I claim that "Christians 
worldwide" allow to "go wanting" 
that which the writer listed. I am 
aware of the good works which many 
Christians perform and I certainly 
recognize Christianity's diversity. Ro- 
man, on ihc other hand, ignores 
Christianity's diversity when he men- 
tions his perplexity at "the Christian 
community's seeming intertwining of 
Cod's will with the G.OP. Platform." 
That platform was crafted to appeal 
to the religious right, lie priorities of 
which are not reflective of the whole 
Christian community. Many Proics- 
tanis and Catholics consider them- 
selves 10 be pro-choice, while others 
consider themselves 10 be pro-life. 
Stances toward our country's military 
establishment and the guiding as- 
s^umpiions of U.S. foreign policy also 
vary widely among Christians. Pro- 
gressive Christians often tend to 
question and even resist our society's 
militaristic priorities and promotion 
of violence as a problem panacea. 
Conservative Christians often tend to 
align themselves with the violent, 
mihtaristic st^us quo. 

The majority of people Ihai I've 
spoken with locally who identify 
themselves as "pro-life" display ei- 
ther a tendency to adhere to the con- 



servative/militaristic camp, or a com- 
placency toward military abuses, both 
of which are incongniem with their 
claims of respect for the sanctity of 
life. My commentary's point is that 
this incongniency illuminates their 
insincerity, 

Enoneousiy attributing my views to 
The Communicator, Roman referred 
to the lerm "anti-choice," as a 'loaded 
wording' and suggested my use of the 
word was unreasonable. Prior to this 
citatioti, however, he set up a propa- 
gandisiic dichotomy with his claim 
that there has been "pro- and anti- 
atMriion rhetoric in The Commumca- 
tor,,,," and he itiiensiried that insult 
with questions phrased to imply 
that "pro-choice people" are for 
women choosing abortion over oth- 
er aliemaiives. 

The pro-choice movement seeks to 
make accessible, and to defend, the 
full range of reproductive rights for 
women, be they motherhood, preg- 
nancy prevention through conception 
or safe, legal abortion. A central goal 
of the pro-choice movement is 10 
minimize the number of abortions 
thai occur, through comprehensive 
voluntary family plaiming. 

The anti-choice movement's agenda 
to block access to legal abortion a 
family planning services, by contrast, 
is a proven failure as a means to it's 
purponed end. The results of dictator 
Nicolae Ceausescu's Id year ban on 
abortion and coniraccpiivcs in Roma- 
nia afford a glimpse ai what anii- 
choicers would visit upon us. 

Despite the fact that atwrtion was a 
criminal offense subject in some cas- 
es 10 capital punishment, Romania's 
rates ot abortion and abonion-relaied 
maternal death outranked all other 
European countries in the t980's. 
Abonion rates in Latin America have 
remained high for over 20 years, de- 
spite generally restrictive laws and 
tlie Catholic Church hierarchy's op- 
position to contraception. 

When prohibitionisi legal codes are 
employed, maternal death rates are 
most affected, not abortion rates. 
When access 10 family planning ser- 
vices is limited or denied, abortion 
rates dramatically increase. Aboruon 
rates decrease most where legal 



abonion and comprehensive volun- 
tary family planning services arc 
available. 

Denmark is an excellent example. 
Denmark's healthcare system, while 
making safe abortions easily accessi- 
ble to Danish women, also makes 
contraceptives, pregnancy healthcare, 
and counseling available for all 
Danes, regardless of income. Conse- 
quently, Detunark's teen pregnancy 
rate is less than half thai of ihc U.S. 
In 1981, Denmark's leenatxinion rate 
was also less than half that of the 
U.S.; by 1985, Denmark's rate had 
fallen to 16 abortions per 1000 fe- 
males aged 15 to 19. compared 10 44 
per 1000 females in ihe same age 
bracket in the U.S. 

Efforts to adopt programs like Den- 
mark's in the U.S. are vigorously op- 
posed by the ami -choice movement, 
the religious right in general and their 
corporate collaborators. 

In light of the facis, it's reasonable 
to conclude that if effected, the "pro- 
life" movement's social agenda 
would increase abortion rates, within 
an unsafe and illegal selling, and in- 
crease abortion-related maternal 
death rates, injuries and a host of oth- 
er related ills. 

Judged by the existing results of the 
social experiment ii promotes, the 
"pro-life" movement is in fact "pro- 
aboriion" and "pro-death," 1 have 
chosen to be diplomatic by using less 



inflammatory yet accurate description 
for the pro-abortion/pro-death move- 
ment: anti-choice. 

Roman resorted 10 name-calling. 
and a cheap tactic guaranteed 10 elicit 
rebuttal, when he called pro-choice 
propoiienis pro-abortion, and implied 
that they warn to limit alternatives to 
abonion. If Roman's claim ihat "the 
person who resorts lo name-calling 
has already lost the argument" is inie, 
he has lost his own argument. 

Wiih regard to Roman's foreign 
policy views, by his exclusionary bc- 
siowiil of "worthy victim" status on 
Iraq's Kurds, he raises many ques- 
tions in my mind. Iraq's Shi-itcs, in 
all likelihood suffered worse reper- 
cussions than Iraq's Kurds during the 
same period to which Rotnan's letter 
refers. Are the Kurds, with their 
Aryan physical characteristics and 
origins more worth mentioning than 
the arabic Shi-iies? Furthermore, 
Turkey's President Turgei Aial. who 
George Bush called "a protector of 
peace," bombed Turkey's Kurds dur- 
ing the Gulf crisis, causing hundreds 
of thousands of Turkish Kurd 
refugees lo dee to mountains, in the 
depths of winter, without provisions 
or aid. 

How come Iraq's Kurds arc 
worth mcQUoning, but Turkey's 
Kurds are not?

National Student Exchange offers 
opportunities for transfer credit 



By Ben Solero 
Managing Editor 

An informational meeting on the 
National Student Exchange program 
will be held Monday, March 1, at 
noon in Kettlcr Hall, Room 108. 

According to Lauri Hcrbrand. coor- 
dinator of NSE at IPFW. the March I 
meeting has been set up to ac&lt;juaint 
students with the opponunity the ex- 
change program offers, to answer any 
questions students have about NSE, 
and also, to give interested students 
one last chance to apply before the 
Fall 



The National Student Exchange of- 
fers IPFW students an opportunity to 
attend other colleges throughout the 
United Slates, as well as Pueno Rico. 
Guam, and the Virgin Islands. 

Students participating in the pro- 
gram pay IPFW tuition raies, remain 
eligible for financial aid, and receive 
transfer credit toward IPFW degrees 
according to Herbrands. 

"Since we are a commuter campus, 
many of our students live at home, 
and have never had the chance to at- 
tend a residential campus," said Her- 
brand. "The program offers a nice op- 
portunity for those students who warn 



10 get a taste of that lifestyle." Her- 
brand continued, 

"Students go to other colleges 
through the program for different rea- 
sons," she said. They either go for 
geography, major, or cultural 
change." 

Currently, IPFW students in the pro- 
gram attend colleges in Georgia, Col- 
orado, California, and North Carolina 
noted Herbrand. 

The program is currently in its 25th 
year of operation, while it has been 
available at IPFW 21 years.

According to Beityc Poignard. di- 
rector of IPFW Multicultural Ser- 
vices, recognizing men 
who have influenced 
young African- Americans

"The media gives plenty 
of negative coverage of 
the African- American - 
male. You see very little 
of the positive aspects re- 
ported," says Poignard. 

Guesi speaker for the 
breakfast was Charlie 
Nelms, chancellor of In- 
diana University in Rich- 
mond and liaison to the 
Americ:an Association of

The men honored were; communiiy 
activist Thomas Brown; Hector Gar- 
cia, EPFW associate professor of line 
ans; David McCants. IPFW interim 
vice chancellor for academic affairs; 
the Rev. Temac Jordan of Greater 
Progressive Baptist Church; and 
South Side High School senior Jabai 
Thiiit. 

"Hector Garcia is an 'artisie e:&lt;traor-, 
dinaire" who is committed to cultural 
diversity." said Poignard. 

Garcia's an includes a Martin 
Luther King. Jr. memorial bust and a 
commemorative medal for the late 
xtivisi. 

David McCants was honored for his 
efforts 10 recruit and encourage mi- 
nority students at IPFW. Along with 
Garcia, McCants enthusiastically en- 
dorses Multicultural Services pro- 
grams, indicates Poignard. His office 
provides significant support to the 
Martin Luther King, Jr. services.

A. No. HIV infeaion is not 
spread like colds or flu. To 
infect someone, the virtjs 
has to gel into the 
bloodstream, an unlikely 
event in a restaurant. The 
virus can't survive for long 
outside the body, and, even 
If it could, dishwashing 
would kill it.

Razorbacks favor ability 



By B«n Solero 
Managing editor 

After just two games, the Razor- 
backs have established a staunch 
presence on the intramural baskeibaJI 
s and after last year's runner-up 
performance, the team leaves little 
room for improvement. 

The Razorbacks hopes are pinned 
on ability and teamwork, rather than 
their presence according to Razor- 
back captain Brandon Crcighton. 

"We plan on wirming ii [his year," 
staled Creighion. "We've been play- 
ing together for years; we keep our 
Razorback team together."

Despite his team's edge — the Razor- 
backs have playeU intramural basket- 
ball together for three straight years, 
Crcighton noted the improved compe- 
tition since he began playing. 

"It's great. The first year I played, 
there were not a lot of teams. But, in- 
tramurals have been progressing each 
year with better teams and increased 
competition," said Creighion. 

Joining Creighion on the Razorback

Jason Landis. Kevin Thompsoo, Mike 
Powell, and Andy Brackemyer. 



By Michael Bass 
Sports Editor 

The games tied at 70. Number 39 
has the ball with 3 seconds Icfi.. 

:03,., He pulls up at about 15 feet 
away. Only one thought in his mind; 
make the shot. The defense lunges at 
the ball, as (he shot goes on its way... 

:02,.. A whistle blows as the ball 
spins loward the basket. The shot is 
wide, and time is suspended,,. A foul 
has been called. 

Half the crowd yells in delight ai 
what must have been an obvious foul, 
while the other half of the crowd 
rages that the call is totally absurd. 
The game will be won or lost at ihe 
free throw line. 

The referee looks around at a crowd 
of hostile faces. He stands self-con- 
scious about aJl the yelling and vio* 
lent words directed at him. 

He hears "Hey bum, is your son on 
die team?" or "Ref, here's my glass- 
es, you need diem." 

The referee looks over to the other 
side of the coun where fans are ap- 
plauding the call. He realizes that 
they arc no better and remembers, on- 
ly moments before, that they were 
yelling ihe same violent, belittling 
chants over a different call he had 
made. 



He knows that someone in Ihe 
crowd may take a jab at him at the 
end of die game, but he doesn't let it 
affect his judgement. 

He has already accepted diat he is 
not perfect, but wonders why the 
crowd, the players, and die coaches 
cannot accept his imperfection. The 
same imperfections that every human 
on this eanh shares. 



The ball's 
in my court 



Maybe ii was a bad call, or maybe it 
wasn't. Maybe he should have never 
made the call, but then someone 
would yclt that he had missed the 
call, or dial he was playing favorites. 

He's caught in the crossfire. He 
dodges shots from all around. He has 
the most thankless job, but he still 
continues to do it. 

A referee doesn't do it for ihc mon- 
ey, but rather for the passionate love 
of the the sport he has. His gratitude 
comes from knowing he did die best

job he could, no matier the outcome 
of the game. 

Yet. as the crowd hurls its insults, 
he must wonder why he gives to them 
(the crowd, die players, the coaches), 
when they give nothing in return. 

He persists, however, until the day that 
he can't go on. He never knows glory. 
he's nevCT given love and he's never 
allowed the respect he deserves. 

I realize, as a fan, 1 too have to put 
the blame on the referee. After all die 
blame has to go somewhere, but that 
kind of thinking is wrong and should 
be discouraged. 

Give the guy a break. His job is 
hard enough without glaring eyes 
waiting to point out his every 
mistake. 

The referee carries such a large 
load, that heaping insults will only 
take away from his conccntraiion on 
the game. 

To the referee I would like to be the 
first to say good job. Thanlc you for 
taking on such a diankless job. Con- 
tinued success, and may die crowd be 
a little less hostile tonight.

Lady 'Dons avenge loss 



By Michael Bass 
Sports Editor 

Revenge was whai Junior Dawn 
Dressier wanted Satmtlay Feb. 6 
sgainit Uic visiting KcnTucky Wcs- 
leyan Panthers, 

Dressier wanted revenge from a 
loss the Lady 'Dons were dealt 
a month before in Owensboro. 
Kentucky. 

Revenge was what Dressier re- 
ceived, beating Kentucky Wesleyan 
58-54. The win put the Lady 'Dons at 
7-13 for ihc season. 

On Thursday, Feb. 4, in a game that 
would be decided by two free throws 
with 10 seconds left, visiting South- 
ern Indiana snatched victory from 
rPFW 65 -^S. 

Freshman Lindy Jones shined for 
IPFW. scoring 20 points lo lead the 
team on both nights, Jones currently 
leads the team at scoring with 12.6 
points per game, and has led leam 
scoring in four of their last Tivc 
games. 

"I'm feeling a lot more comforlabte 
with college ball and ihc game," said 
Jones, "I feel like I want the ball in 
my hands and I can shoot if I want 
to shoot." 

Against Kentucky Wesleyan the La- 



dy 'Dons were down 30-26 at the end 
of the first half, but came alive defen- 
sively in the second half, allowing 
only five points in the first seven and 
a half minutes. 

The Lady 'Dons were able to lake 
the lead with IS minutes left in the 
game. Kentucky Wesleyan, however, 
paced right behind IPFW waiting 
10 strike. 

With eight minutes, 10 seconds left 
Kentucky Wesleyan made their move, 
surging forward for the lead. TTie La- 
dy 'Dons struck back quickly on a 
jumper by Jones to take the lead. 

With a four point lead in the last 
minute of play Kentucky Wesleyan 
tried 10 surge one more time. The La- 
dy 'Dons, however, were determined 
and held off the final Kentucky Wes- 
leyan attack. 

With 19 seconds left, junior Amy 
Perkins drove for the basket to clinch 
the game. Her shot re-established TTie 
Lady 'Dons four point lead and was 
the last basket of the game. 

"Patience and good defense were 
the key lo the win." said Freshman 
Jennie Ncwhard. 

The Lady "Dons were riding high at 
the end of the first hal/ against South- 
em Indiana and had a 1 2 point lead to 
show for it.

Poor shooting and a strong IPFW 
defense caused Southern Indiana to 
shoot only 18 J percent from the field 
for the first half. 

Second half play saw Southern Indi- 
ana pick up their game which pulled 
them right back into the comest. With 
II minutes. 51 seconds left they tied 
the game up. coming back from the 
Lady 'Dons 1 2 poini lead. 

The two teams struggled for the 
lead in a sec-saw battle. With 57 sec- 
onds left in the game the score was 
even at 63-63, Both teams' defenses 
played strong . not allowing an- 
other basket. 

With five seconds left Southern In- 
diana's Lisa Wells had the ball and 
was heading for the baskpt. She 
tripped up and lost the ball, but IPFW 
was cal1«l for a questionable foul. 

Wells made both free throws to take 
the le^ and the game from IPFW. 

Newhard had a strong first half 
against Southern Indiana, scoring 16 
points but went cold down the stretch, 
ortly adding two points in the last 
20 minutes. 

Perkins had four assists against 
Southern Indiana and eight against 
Kentucky Wesleyan, She is only two 
assists away from the 100 assist 
plateau. One hundred assists has only 
been accomplished fouj other times 
in the team's history. 

The Lady "Dons will host their third 
straight home game on Saturday, Feb. 
13. The leam will face Ashland be- 
ginning at 6:05 pJn, 



Mastodons 

Season highlighted by win, Gibson 



By Michael Bass 
Sports Editor 

As the 1992-93 men's basketball 
continues on its way, it becomes more 
evident that this team is different 
from teams of the past. 

For the first time in 1 1 years of play 
against each other the IPFW men's 
basketball team defeated Kentucky 
Wesleyan. After 18 tries the 
Mastodons were finally successful 
beating Kentucky Wesleyan 81-67. 

The team, at 16-3, is on its way to 
having one of the best records ever 
posted by an IPFW men's basketball 
team. The best record was posted in

both 88-89 and 91-92 seasons when 
the team went 21-7, 

The Mastodons own a perfect II-O 
record ai the Milliard Gates 
Spons Center. 

The Mastodons beat the old IPFW 
record for points scored in a game 
with 118 points against Goshen col- 
lege for the win. The Mastodons had 
scored ! 17 points on two difTercni oc- 
casions during the 91-92 season. 

Offensively the team is ranked fifth 
in the nation for field goal percentage 
with a 55.6 percent average. 

The Mastodons are the only IPFW 
team in history to grab the four spot 
in the Associated Press Poll. The 
team held the spot for a week at the 
beginning of January and is currently 
ranked 20 in the nation. 

Not only is the team breaking 
records, but many players are seeking 
and accomplishing new individual 
records. 

Senior Sean Gibson became the 
leading IPFW career scorer two 



weeks ago at an away game against 
Lewis. Gibson already holds the 
records for most free throws and most 
rebounds in a season. 

Gibson currently leads the GLVC 
with a scoring average at 22 points 
per game, and is ranked 18 in the na- 
tion for scoring. 

Both Gibson and Senior Doug 
Reinckc arc seeking Oie blocked shots 
record and are currently tied nt 99 
each. 

Senior Andre Walton is firet in the 
GLVC for assists averaging 6.8 per 
game, and is fourth in the OLVC for 
steals with 1 .9 per game. 

Senior Shane Gibson is founh in the 
GLVC having a 41 percent three 
point average. 

The team is tied at second in the 
GLVC and hopes to improve that 
record, when they host Ashland on 
Saturday Feb. 13 at the Hilliard Gates 
Sports Center.
