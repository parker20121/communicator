When students first began attending IPFW, which was 
established in 1964, Kettler Hall was the lone building on 
campus. Over time, construction began and other buildings 
rose to meet the ever-expanding demands from the growing 
student population and education departments. In doing so, IPFW has brought 
greater opportunities to college students. 

IPFW now zhas twelve main buildings that make up campus - along with 
a hotel, student housing and numerous places to hang around and enjoy the 
time spent at school. Still, with all of those changes, Kettler Hall continues 
to be the center of activities. Kettler Hall is where most collaborative groups 



meet, study areas are available, the largest computer lab on campus is located 
and a vast array of offices reside. Chancellor Michael Wartell humorously used 
the example of how busy Subway is at any given time to measure the amount 
of activity in the building. 

Though Kettler Hall will always be a very important and historical part of 
IPFW, Warteil decided that it was time to "shift the center of campus more 
toward the actual center of campus." To accomplish that goal, construction 
began in May of last year, according to Wartell, to bring that vision of campus 
to life. Ultimately, the Student Services and Library Complex project will cost 
$42.4 million.

CAMPUS CONSTRUCTION 

"An exceptional environment for teaching, learning, and student achievement" 



CONT. 



By Kristan Mensch 



According to a pamphlet on the site 
plan, "The addition of collaborative- 
learning space, new classrooms, a stu- 
dent commons, and an international 
student center wilt provide students 
and faculty with countless opportu- 
nities to connect on both a social and 
interactive level, while supporting aca- 
demic programming." 

Students seem to have mixed feel- 
ings about the whole project. Some 
are happy and contentedly waiting for 
completion, while others are upset or 
do not know any of the details concern- 
ing the complex. 

"I cannot wait until the extension 
of Walb and the 'skywalk' connecting 
it to the library is finished," said IPFW 
student Jackie Hesley, adding that 
the accomplishments made by the 
construction workers never cease to 
impress her. "It seems every Monday 
when I get back |on campus] ... another 
dramatic improvement has been made 
to the additions," Hesley said. 

In agreement, student Colin McCal- 
lister, who had unpleasant experiences 
at his old high school with construction 
is also impressed by the sudden rising. 

"One thing I am surprised about 
is how fasi these guys (construction 
workers) work," McCallister said, af- 
ter mentioning that the majority of his 
high school years were taken up with 
construction, while tPFW seems to be 
running quickly. 

"t think that once the last brick is 
laid and the last beam is erected, it will 
be worth it," McCallister concluded. 

Some students are not as impressed, 
mple, student Tony 




though. For 
Yaney said that he 
is not even sure 
of what is being 
built, but he feels 
like it is taking 
"forever." 

In rum, oth- 
ers apparently 
feel uneasy about 
the new addi- 
tions. "Bridges 
to nowhere and 
tunnels without 
purpose are a 
waste." said stu- 
dent Jack Ells- 
worth, though he 
said the new ad- 
ditions are okay 
if they make the 
campus more 
functional. 

W a r t e 1 I 
laughed while 
mentioning the 
"bridge to nowhere," which was com- 
pleted in Fail of 2008. stating that con- 
struction is being planned for that area 
of campus in the near future as well. 
- He mentioned that there will be a new 
Alumni center and a park on die other 
side of the river. Also, a new parking ga- 
rage is to be made near the Visual Arts 
building. 

To clarify, the work on the Student 
Services expansion, which is expected 
to be finished Fall 2011, will bring a

large indoor running track with multi- 
use courts in the middle and coaching 
offices to the side, said Wartell. 

In addition, a student commons 
area will bring more places for students 
to eat, as well as a few extra classrooms, 
collaborative learning space ami .m 
international student center. Follett's 
bookstore will move into the new area 
and expand, said 
Wartell. Then, 
there is going to 
be an over-head 
walkway connect- 
ing the complex 
to Helmke library. 
All of that will be 
wrapped up in a 
design that stays 
in-line with the 
buildings IPFW 
already has while 
also bringing a 
more modern- 
looking structure 
to campus. 

Over all. ac- 
cording to the 
pamphlet. the 
current construc- 
tion is going to 
be approximately 
173.000 square 
feet, consisting of 
"two stories above grade and a partial 
lower lever below grade." 

The additional space is undoubted- 
ly needed for IPFW students. According 
to the National Center for Education 
Statistics INCES). the total enrollment 
at IPFW for Fall 2008 was 12,338 stu- 
dents. 

Though, because of the economic 
hardship that many people have ex- 
perienced nadonally in recent years. 



many returning adults, unemployed 
workers and those opting to stay in 
school for higher education, IPFW saw 
a great increase after 2008. 

As stated on iprw.edu, enrollment 
has reached over 13 thousand, with 8.5 
thousand of those students attending 
classes full-time. In turn, IPFW holds 
over 2 hundred degrees and certificates 
for students to achieve. 

In addition, NCES shows that 27 
percent of first-time, full-time stu- 
dents from Fall 2000 did not graduate 
until their eighth year at IPFW. Follow- 
ing closely, 22 percent took six years, 
and only 4 percent completed their 
degree in the traditional four year slot. 
Because of this, ever-graduating high 
school seniors will undoubtedly con- 
tinue to enroll as freshmen in coming 
years, increasing the student popula- 
tion even more while others stay longer 
to earn their degrees. 

With a campus that is 642 acres, 



IPFW is beginning to utilize much 
more space, which in turn will help 
to accommodate the growing student 
body. The entire project will not raise 
student expenses at all, said Wartell, 
and it is being done with the students' 
needs in mind, trying to make IPFW a 
better place for all enrolled. 

According to the mission, values and 
vision statement, IPFW envisions "an 
exceptional environment for teaching, 
learning, and student achievement," 
and values "a campus environment 
that promotes integrity, respect for 
diversity, responsible citizenship, 
accountability, sustainability, 

and continuous improvement." 
Basically, in keeping with that 
statement, Wartell stressed that 
although not all students realize what 
is going on with all of the construction 
or disagree with it completely, that the 
whole project is "fundamentally for the 
people we serve."

"No matter what we're looking for we will be 
meeting new people as we go through life, and while 
1 can see how easy that can be for someone who Is 
quite an aggressive communicator like you two, 
I'm definitely more passive in my communication 
style. Do you guys have any tricks or games to help 
in gelling to know a person? Or, since your show is 
trying to focus on what we can control In ourselves, 
any (ricks for letting oneseUbe known?" 

Nate, thank you for the comment and question. 
Tirst, Wil and I agree, "no games!" We realize that you 
probably do noi mean it in the way we're taking 
it, hut "games" and "tricks" seem like things 
that get in the way of being honest with 
yourself and other people. We can 
definitely give suggestions for ways 
to modify your thought processes 
and behaviors, though! When wc 
read your question, we kept thinking 
that honesty does require some 
confidence, but the best way to j 
practice being confident is through I 
passion! Even the meekest person ' 
lights up when talking about one of 
their passions, no matter what it is, and 
generally that energy and enthusiasm is 
contagious. Never be afraid to share your 
passions with people. Of course, we always 
suggest doing a bit of self-reflection to determine 
which ones may be appropriate to share. 

We get the feeling people believe they have to 
start with the small talk and work their way up to the 




good stuff.. .it's how we're raised. "Work before play. 
Veggies before dessert. Socially acceptable small talk 
before honesty." Throw 'em out! Have fun, order 
dessert first, and get at the core of who you 
are. There's no need to save it. because 
there's more on the way! Don't be afraid 
to be the best you are righi now. 

Finally, sometimes we seem to I 
confuse being assertive for being 
aggressive. Aggressiveness puts | 
your needs before others, whereas 
assert iveness is just clearly and non- 
judgmentally stating what you want 
(without disparaging others} and ■ 
usually includes very descriptive f 
language. Being a "passive (or 1 
introverted) person" and being 
sertive are not mutually 
exclusive. lust because 
someone is shy, and does 
not like to make a "splash- 
when walking into a room 
does not mean that they 
cannot assertively talk to 
people. The first step is to accept 
ourselves as we are and become 
one with it. Then, realize that in 
every moment we have choices, 
and whatever choice we make, and 
whatever response we choose in any 
given situation, can be one in which we 
are fully aligned with our needs or wants, 
as well as being conscious of others and 
their needs and wants. The key is listening to 
your needs and wants upfront, and not waiting until 
the end of the night and hearing them as regrets. 
There are no tricks or games, no quick fixes. In 



order to help others get to know you, come into every 
interaction without labeling yourself ("I'm passive"), 
that the connection can genuinely evolve 
around the wants and needs of both you 
and the other person. If that happens, 
you'll leave every situation without 
regrets, knowing that you assertively 
and authentically were listening to 
your being and made good on the 
call. Robert Earl Keen has a great 
song called "No Kinda Dancer" 
that demonstrates the hope

As the new Editor-in-Chief, I 

am very pleased with the team 

of writers and editors that will 

be working in the newsroom 

next semester. I have no doubt 

that our office will continue to 

burst with creativity and award- 
winning journalism. This year, 

our staff took home eight awards 

from The Indiana Collegiate 

Press Association. With our 

excepiional team, 1 know we 

will steal the show next year and 

take home more awards. But we 

are also looking for talented new 

writers all the time. So if you 

are interested in being involved 

with something great, stop by 

Walb 215 and talk to us. 

I'm also delighted to 

announce Alisha Humbert 

as next semester's Managing 

Editor. I have no doubt that 

she and 1 will be unstoppable 

in our efforts to carry on The 

Communicator. 

If you are interested in writing, or if you want to make a complaint or just 

let me know you like the paper, do not hesitate to drop by the office or send me 

an e-mail. Drop by for a coffee chat if you're in the Walb vicinity: everyone cool 

knows our office makes the best- 
Bring your own cup though.. .unless you want to drink your beverage out of 

a moldy Batman mug. Hey.. .we are a newsroom. We don't exactly have lime to 

wash dishes and report on current events. 

Regardless, I am looking forward to bringing you a simply amazing newspaper 

this fall.

OPINION 



P. 5 



By Lucas Carter 

fuca sea rTrrphq rography.com 

The economy is bad at the 
moment. That is probably the most 
obvious statement that could be 
made in an issue of any newspaper, 
anywhere across the country or even 
in the world right now. Europe's 
financial structure is collapsing, the 
country is in debt 10 gazillion dollars, 
and the daily Wall Street Journal 
cover brings nothing but good news 
every day of the week. Sarcasm aside, 
things are bleakacross the board. Last 
year 1 made the decision to switch my 
major from Electrical Engineering to 
Photography. Am I crazy? Probably, 
but I'm a big believer that 'doing what 
you love is worth being poor.' 

Photo majors at IPFW are not 
crazy for pursuing their passion, but 
the harsh reality is, just like many 
other careers, it's just as cut-throat as 
any other profession at the moment. 
Doctors, teachers and engineers are 
all struggling for jobs against kids 
straight out of college that are willing 
to work for $20,000 less a year than 
they are. 

Anyone that has taken the 
popular Photojournalism class J210 
with Fort Wayne photographer Clint 
Keller has surely been told all about 
how photography is not the career to 
put your hopes, dreams, and money 
into at the moment. The fact is, the 
market is unbelievably flooded. 
Everybody and their cousin now 
has a point and shoot camera or 
entry level DSLR (digital single-lens 
reflex) camera capable of producing 
adequate photos. 

Most aspiring photographers 
look to the portraiture side of 
photography; senior portraits, family 
portraits, weddings, etc. There is no 
question that this field is suffering 



the flood of the 'friends with cameras' 
plague more than any other. 

"Anyone can buy a camera, a few 
lenses, take a workshop, buy a website 
template andthen market themselves 
as a pro photographer," Chicago 
based wedding photographer 
Christopher Zibutis said. "The fact 
that anyone with a semi decent DSLR 
thinks that they can be a professional 
photographer is the biggest harm to 
the trade of photography." 

Photojournalism is another 
popular outlet for aspiring 
photographers, but this could be the 
hardest of areas to succeed in. Large 
daily newspapers across America 
are eliminating staff photographer 
positions in favor of sending 
reporters out with basic point and 
shoot cameras. 

"We as a society are suffering from 
"good enough" syndrome. We don't 
want quality products anymore. It is 
all about how little we have to pay 
for the item. We would rather buy a 
new 99&lt;T screwdriver every year than 
spend $4.00 for a quality version that 
would outlive the buyer." Fort Wayne 
photojoumalist Brian Tombaugh 
said. "People shop for photographer* 
the same way. We either choose 
someone with very little experience 
based on price and not the quality of 
the work portfolio, or we find a friend 
or relative who has "a good camera" 
to take the photos for us so that we 
can save money." 

Many people involved in the 
journalism community in Fort 
Wayne are more than aware of the 
loss of jobs that several long-term 
photographers have suffered. One 
photographer spent twenty years 
at a Fort Wayne daily, then had his 
position eliminated in the spring of 
this year.

Debuting at #1, B.o.B's, "Adventures 
of Bobby Hay", stole the charts with 
two hit singles and 84.000 records 
sold in its first week. First appearing 
in 2007 withbis single. '"Hater?.", B.o.B. 
decided he was not being true enough 
to himself and made a style all of his 
own. Singing, rapping, and playing 
acoustic guitar along with producing 
some of his own beats on his album. 
B.o.B. displays a multitude of talents. 

The content of his songs range 
from sad realities of life to looking 



on the brightside, all done with very 
catchy light melodies. This albums is 
a little too pop for my taste, and some 
might question if he lost the sound 
he displayed on his mixtapes like 
"B.o.B verses Bobby Ray." Still, while 
the sound has changed, the content is 
just as honest. You can really hear his 
Atlanta roois and Can easily note his 
Outkast influence. 

The album features great acts such 
as Lupe Fiasco, Eminem, T.I., lanelle 
Monae, Weezer, Haylcy Williams of 
Paramore, and introducing, the very 
talented Bruno Mars. You can buy it at 
any music store, but the iTunes version 
comes with 3 bonus tracks.

Indiana- Purdue Student Govern- 
ment -IPSGA- serves as "the student's 
voice" on the IPFW campus. It con- 
sists of a Student Senate, Student Ac- 
tivities Board [SAB], Judicial Court 
and Executive Board. 

The Executive Board is made up 
of four members who head various 
aspects of IPSGA and are elected into 
office at the end of each year. The 
2010/2011 Executive Officers consist 
of Terel Lynn- Student Body Presi- 
dent, Anthony Decker- Vice president 
of Legislation, Eric Smith- Vice Presi- 
dent of Finance and Nikita Matthews- 
Vice President of Student Program- 
ming. 

As Student Body President, Lynn 
will serve as the figurehead of IPSGA. 
represent the students of IPFW, ratify 
or veto every bill that Student Senate 
votes on and appoint new justices to 
the judicial Court. This may seem 
like an easy job but the President has 
many ethical issues that must be de- 
cided upon. For example, should IPS- 
GA fund supposed "missions trips" or 
trips to missionary conferences? This 
is one decision diat the Student Presi- 
dent oflastycar had tomake. Student 
Senate has $195,500 to allocate this 
year. 

The Vice President of Legislation 
presides over the Student Senate, who 
is responsible for allocating funds 
(which come from the student activ- 
ity fees of the each student's tuition) 
to students, both individuals and stu- 
dent organizations, for various activi- 
ties, such as conference trips. 



Decker only votes in case of a tie. 
His main role will be reviewing re- 
quests that come into Student Senate, 
making sure that the Senate Commit- 
tees stay on task and running Senate 
meetings. 

Matthews is in charge of SAB. 
who host various on campus events 
such as "Welcome Back Week" in 
fall, "Spring Fling" at the end of the 
spring semester, Homecoming and 
other events. Her job mainly consists 
of organizing these events and mak- 
ing sure they run smoothly. SAB has 
$310,000 to spend on various events 
this year. 

As Vice President of Finance, Eric 
Smith oversees IPSGA's finances. He 
monitors how much money is in each 
fund makes updates accordingly and 
sends reports of these findings to the 
Student Senate. 

Finally there is the Judicial Court. 
It normally consists of five members 
who are appointed by the Student 
Body President as their seats open. 
They elect their own chief and make 
rulings on the constitutionality of de- 
cisions made within student govern- 
ment. 

At this time there is only one, 
newly appointed member on the ju- 
dicial court. Last year's membership 
abused their duties by making man- 
dates that were unconstitutional and 
failing to hold meetings. The respon- 
sibility of appointing four new mem- 
bers to the Judicial Court now rests on 
Lynn's shoulders, but before his future 
nominees can take office the Student 
Senate must first approve them. If 
these new judges avoid impeach- 
ment/recall, then they will serve on 
the court for a two year term.

Winter Olympics Men's Hockey 
Gold Medal Game (USA vs. Canada) 

The NHL took a two week break 
during their season to allow players to 
play in the Olympics for their nation. In 
the preliminary groupings team USA 
stunned team Canada 5-3. But after 
both teams fought their way to the 
gold medal game for a rematch Team 
Canada won the gold over the USA in 
3-2 in overtime. For team USA Parise 
scored the game tying goal with 24 
seconds remaining. Then in overtime 
Sidney Crosby scored the gold medal 
winning goal. That game was the most 
watched hockey game since the 1980 
gold medal game. It was an instant 
classic and even if you were not a fan of 
hockey you had to be watching. 

2010 Masters 

It started last Thursday and finished 
up on Sunday. The Masters marked 
the return of Tiger Woods. As Tiger 
made his way to the first tee the crowd 
roared and was very happy to see him 



back on the golf course. But 59 year 
old Tom Watson stole the show. On 
day two Ian Poulterand LeeWesrwood 
ended the day lied for the lead. On day 
three, Westwood played steadily to 
lead going into the final day. Mickelson 
ended the day one stroke back after 
hitting two eagles back to back nearly 
a third. Masters Sunday was the best 
in a while because of the people in 
contention like Mickelson, a returning 
Tiger, Westwood, Kim, Choi, and 
Couples. This day would belong to Phil 
Mickelson as he beat out Westwood 
by four strokes on Sunday to win the 
Masters by three and get another green 
jacket. Anthony Kim made a surge to 
finish in third four strokes back, Tiger 
and KT Choi tied for fourth five strokes 
behind Phil as Fred Couples finished 
up in sixth. 

Mickelson also returned to action 
to this tournament with his wife and 
mother both in the crowd as they battle 
breast cancer. It was a very emotional 
moment after he sank his final put on 
1 8 giving him the green jacket.

IPFW softball got a win last sunday 
because of the solid tosses over the 
plate and some sweet contact with the 
bat. The 'Dons were able to defeat the 
Oakland Grizzlies in a regular season 
matchup in the opener (8-1) and closer 
(4-1) improving their record 28-17. 

The MAstodons were able to slam 
four over the outfield fence, adding on 
to a season sum of 44 homers. 

Catcher Kristina Karpun hit a pair 
of homeruns totaling her season out 
at 14, which ties her for third most in a 
single season in league history. 

Oakland struck first in the opener, 
scoring a run after a walk and a hit-by- 
pitch put runners on first and second, 
before a wild pitch advanced the pair. 
IPFW answered back quickly as Stacey 
Swinford smacked a double. She was 
then able to advance to second on a 
Grizzly over throw to second. The in- 
ning ended scoreless. 

The third inning was a different 
story and Courtney Cronin and Cassie 
Wolfe took their bases at second and 
third. Cronin scored on a wild pitch 
and Wolfe scored on a dropped fly ball 
to right field. These two runs placed the 
Mastodons up 3-1. 

Karpun, who came into the game 
ranked 28th in NCAA Division 1 in slug- 
ging percentage, saw her average rise 
dramatically in the bottom of the fourth 
inning when she led off the frame with 
a solo home run to center field. 

As the 'Dons led 4-1 IPFW placed 
four more runs on the board in the 
fifth and finished with a whoping eight.
