zations and clubs during the orgamzatJonal fair 
portion of the program. During this time, stu- 
dents could pick up information from depan- 
meni£, talk about campus safety with police or 
ask questions of administrators. 

Wliile mingling and enjoying refreshmenis, 
ASTRO paiiicipanis were able to spend 
coupons at various booths for free products and

At 7 pm.. Zielinski and Michael WaHell.

ing their education Fry talked atxiul the many 



resources thai are on campus especially for 
adults lie raised the issue of keeping a balance 
of family, career and education

^ ^B) The night also included a 

number of workshops. 
Among those were

taking. Writing Anxiety and Writing 
Successfully in College, 

"These workshop topics are usually the 
biggest areas of concern for adults, " said 
ZieUnski "'Many may have never even touched 
computers, or used the computer talk used 
today. We choose to have College from A lo Z 
because many are unaware of terminology used 
by professors like syllabus, CPA and credit 
hour." 

Michael 0' Hear, director of transitional stud- 
ies, presented the nolc-taking workshop. Hi 



focused siudenLs on the main pomis of choosing

cess and made people aware (hat this campus 
cares about them. 

"Students over the age of 25 make up 44 per- 
cent of our campus," &lt;aid Zip|&gt;nski, "When they 
are aware we are here for ihem, they build con- 
fidence, enabling them to tackle harder issues,

'Bare Chesr creaied by Nathan Teves will be displayad m the Fine Aris Buildrvg 

Artists use organs 
for inspiration 



by Shannon Finlon 
Chief Reporter 

Recent art works by Nalhan 
Taves and Jalch Fazel, associate 
faculty members in the Fine Arts 
[&gt;epanment, will be on exhibit ai

Admission is free. The opening 
reception for the artists is Friday,

Ans Building Foyer, 

New work from Taves consists 
of a wall sculpture made from clay. 
inspired by the forms of our internal 



organs. His work roots from several 
years of therapy he experienced in 
the I980's. 

Taves uses a high-fire 
stoneware clay lo sculpture, with 
temperatures between 2151-2194°F. 

"Because my sculptures are 
fragile and difficult lo move when 
bone dry and ready for firing, I typ- 
ically build them directly on kiln 
shelves," said Taves

SID offers academic support 



As studenLs begin a new semes- 
ter, many may be haunted by ihe 
semesters gone past, especially after 
the bohdays when grade evaluations 
from the fall semester come out. 

Students' GPAs are especially 
important when Ihey receive finan- 
ciaJ aid. Most scholarships and 
grants come up for yearly renewal, 
and are academically ba.scd. 

IPFW has placed a high priority 
on student achievement The ofTice 
of Multicultural Services is now 
taking on an active role to assist in 
the educational success of studenLs 
of color. 

Those who receive ihe Perkins 
Grant and Summer Bridge prognun 
are eligible lo become part of the 
Students in Danger (SID) program 

SID was created by Christine 
Patterson, director of Multicultural 
Services. 

The main ideaof the program IS 
to provide a network of help and 
support for academic success to 
those who aK struggling, and in 
danger of losing financial support. 

Each faculty member will be 
asked lo identify those students who 
are showing signs of low achieve- 
meni Many symptoms include poor 



duendance. non-panicipalion. fear 
of failure and loss of interest in 
class. Those earning a C or below 
will be notified by their professor 
and will have opportunities to solve 
issues and gain advice about 
improving their standing. The pro- 
fessor then refers Ihem to the Office 
of Multicultural Services for advis- 
mg. At the same time, the center will 
be notified, so thai ihey can begin 
the process of matching an adviser 
to each student. 

The student adviser team will 
then meet to hammer out dimcult 
issues, and improve study habits. 

"The process of mccimg with 
your professors and advisers. " says 
Patterson, "allows students to real- 
ize their progress every week if need 
be." 

Advisers then discuss these 
goals with tfie professors to see if 
changes in class are being made. 

The Center will be able to 
acconunodate all interested students 
who are eligible. 

For some who usually earn good 
grades, bul run inio trouble in one 
class. It can really make a difference 
with Ihem too. 

Students inleresied in more 
mformaiion or who have questions 
may contact Christine 
Patterson ai 481-6608.

Recently over 100 ca,ses were reported of a new doll eaung not 
only iLs plastic treats The Cabbage Patch Kids Snacklimc Kids doll, a 
hit seller this past Christmas for Mattel Inc , wanted more than just a 
snack Tie idea is simple, ihe doll has a bnghi backpack, carrying the 
battery pack ihat powers the mechanical mouth, allowing it lo eat the 
food that comes with it 

Noi so simple is the idea thai when children get too close to their 
doll, it may eat hair and fingers Some victirrLS have been taken to 
emergency rooms so ihai the head could be cracked open, and the hair 
removed. 

Ironically, die doll has been shown not to be dangerous by the fed- 
eral Consumer Product Safety Commission Nevertheless, Mattel has 
decided lo pull the dolls from the shelf, to insure customer sausfaclion.

Evita: Something 
you will remember 



by Carmen Rohlnwin 
Surr Writer 

Eviia IS Ibe coniroversial lalc of 
a symbolic leader of Ihc 
Argentinean govcnunenl. ()w rea- 
son why the stage pnxJuction is su 
popular is because of liic great para- 
dox within the slory The historical 
figure. Eve Peron, was an actress 
and was often no! viewed as gen- 
uine in her attiiiKle '.owards work- 
ing-class people. She was misun- 
derstood and fear^ by ihe elite 
because of her socialist inicniions 
In life, Peron did help Ihe common 
people She gave them wardrobes of 
clothes and other nice luxuries but 
she failed (o find enough Jobs for 
her people. Il is important (o identi- 
fy with (his paradox to fully enjoy 
ihc meal of the movie. 

Madonna is powerful, her 
voice as well as her presence is cap- 
tivating Yes, this time, we can all 
sec that she can act while maintain- 
ing vocal stamina. There is an inwr- 
esting story about Madonna. Early 
in the production of this nim. the 
government of Argentina would not 
allow filming to be set on the 
famous balcony where Peron histor- 
ically stood to give her speeches 
The real life of Peion is still a mean- 
ingful symbol in contemporary 
Argentina Rumor has il that 



Madonna appeared as Eva Peron 
before those regulating the building 
Needless to say, she looked very 
similar to tlic real thing and this is 
how the movie was fdmed from the 
original balcony 

This is a wonderful movie, not 
only for the star power or for the 
musical score (which is excellent) 
Evjia held my complete interest It 
was more than an extended music 
video New musical compositions 
from Andrew Lloyd Webber arc 
standard quality. 

From Ihe beginning. Eviias 
moral char^ter is questioned. This 
is nothing new I will not give it 
away but a fantastic compassion 
comes over when she falls ill. Still, 
after that point. I was unaware of 
how psychological her situation is. 
She ultimately died before her inie 
potential was seen by the people 

By the time (he lights came on 
again, people on either side of me 
were sobbing. It was one of the best 
movie cries I have ever had, I admit 
it. I recommend others to see this 
movie because il draws on curreni 
social problems Most importanUy, 
Evila exposes the common weak- 
ness we all have when we rush to 
judge odiers wiUiout knowing their 
personal reality If people desire to 
see Evita this week, get tickets sev- 
eral hours in advance.

Unbelievable Thoughts 

Thinking of the nights when I dreamed that you would 

reach over and hold me tight 

I felt the burning sensation that floweci within me as I 

laid beside you listening to the silent whispering of yoiir 

breathing as the air of your breathing entered my heart 

and down into my soul. I lay. 
Thinking of how I could enter your dreams while you 
slept a single tear of love slipped from my eye onto the 
fingers ofthe hand that touoied my cheek. I wished. 
As your warm body turned away I felt the softness of 

your back side seeing the

The Theatre Department 
announces auditions for the 
Purdue-Indiana Theatre's world 
premiere musical. ■'Green Around 
The Gills." It is adapted from the 
classic farce by Moliere. "The 
Imaginary Invalid." The musical 
dwells in comedy or "a farcical 
feeling." said writer Craig T 
Humphrey. Larry Life will direct 
and choreograph the production. 

Auditions ate Monday, Jan. 20, 
at 7:30 p.m at Williams Theatre 
Call -backs will be Tuesday, January 
21, at 7:30 p.m. Fifteen character 
roles are available ranging from 
ages 16 to 50 Auditioncrs are 
encouraged to prepare 16 bars from 
an up-tempo song and a piece from 



a muvical. Students are also 
required to bring their own sheet 
music. Scripts are in the theatre 
office. Williams Thcaue, Room 
128. Students and individuals " are 
highly recommended to read the 
script," suggested Humphrey. 

The play centers upon a rich 
and afllueni family. The father of 
the family is a hypochondriac and 
the rest of the family perpetuates 
this fear of ill health because they 
desire to receive a large inheritance. 
All the while, the father is unaware 
of their imenlions and "blindly goes 
along with it," said Humphrey, 
During his daughter's visit. &gt;hc dis- 
covers her family's cruelness and 
cleverly exposes the guilty family 
members. 

Performance dates are April

An ensemble like no other has 
astonished audiences since January 
of 1993. Bimbeiia a group of five 
women who had grown Urcd of for- 
mal classical music concern, came 
logeiher to add a new iwisi lo 
Baroijue mu^ic and pcrfonn il for all 
audiences. 

Pan of Ihe Pkigsienh Fine and 
Performing Arts Series and co-spon- 
sored by WDNI, Bimheila will per- 
form 'The War of Love" in IPFW 
Williams Theaire on Fnday. Jan, 17. 
at 8 p.m They will also lead a class 
Ihal is tree and open lo the public on 
Thursday, Jan. 16. at 3 p.m. in 
Williams Theatre. 

All five members graduated 
from the Early Music Institute ai the 
Indiana University School of Music

up of three sopranos, one harpsi- 
cbordisi and one ceUist. They are 
Andrea FuUmgton. Allison Zelles. 
Shelley Taylor, and original mem- 
bers Kadicrine Shao and Sonja 
Rasmussen. 

Qimbetta is dedicated to per- 
forming Baroque music, minus the 
traditional formality With ongmal 
instruments and a 20th-century 
appeal. Bimbetta goes beyond audi- 
ence expectations. They awe audi- 
ences widi a laid back style Their 
performances are amazingly enter- 
taining due to their creation of relat- 
ing 17lb century music to modem 
day events. Often this ensemble has 
been described as "a blend of 
cabaret, commedia deH'arle and 
MTV Unplugged." 

'They are very accurate in their 
presentation," said Christina Kulow, 
director of Public Relations and the 
Department of Fine and Performing 
Arts. "They transcend a typical clas- 
sical music concert by breaking 



many iraditiunal boundaries. Even 
if you do not undersLind any of the 
words, you do not lose the meaning 
of die music They really help peo- 
ple understand it." 

Bimbetta has been featured at 
the Andient, Berkley, Boston and 
Regcnsberg (Germany) Early Music 
Festivals, has perfomted at many 
colleges and universities; and has 
performed on an altemMive rock 
series in the United Stales and 
Europe Their first CD is being 
released in 1997 and will be avail- 
able at the concert.

Performing Ans Senes, named to 
honor Margaret and the late Willard 
T. Plogstenh, continually make it 
possible for audiences to enjoy 
high-quahiy cultural experiences at 
an affordable price. 

"The community benefits great- 
ly from the Plogstenh Series 
because they are provided an oppor- 
tunity to see unique and enjoyable 
arts events for a lower cost than 
other events of equal caliber in the 
area," said Paul S Meers. visiting 
msLr\jctor of music and pan of the 
planning commiltec for die series. 

"A large number of university 
students benefit from die events in 
the Plogstenh Series because they 
reinforce and expand upon learning 
in the classroom and studio, and 
because students can learn from and 
model these professional anisis," 
said Marcia Hepps, assistant profes- 
sor of theatre as well as a member of 
the planning committee.

Staff Editorial 



Paper encourages 
participation 



Anew semesier, anoiher 
icmindcr. Recently The 
Communieaior has uniJct- 
gone some changes in siaff as well 
as formal Although The 
Communieaior has always wel- 
comed everyone at IPnv lo partic- 
ipate in the work of the paper we 
warn 10 reiterate our msistcnce and 
eagerness lo have diis paper rcdcci 
ibe true diversity and mlcrcsL&gt;i of 
everyone at this school 

Although many of you read our 
paper, and a lot of you already par- 
ticipate in the writing of it. we warn 
to malcc it clc:ar that you are encour- 
aged to do so We ai The 
Communicator arc only 
doing part of our job if regular 
staff members write articles for the 
paper — for then only a few 
viewpoints, opinions, thoughts 
and interesLs are represented 

After ail, this paper docs not 
belong to the editors at The 
Cimmunicator — such a thought 
would be an arrogant one On the 
contrary, this paper is yours as 
much as it is ours However, when 
you allow a few students to repre- 
sent your viewpoints, opinions, 
thoughts and interests without 
any input from you, not only are 
you letting us put out a paper that 
lacks the diversity we strive to 
maintain, but democracy in this 
instance has lost. 

Therefore, it is important to us 
that students from all majors, eth- 
nicity and socioeconomic back- 
grounds coniribuie to this paper We 
owe it to our colleagues lo represent 
the views and inicresis of everyone 
Everyone here has something to 
offer each oUict — somediing dif- 
ferent: somediing that maybe few 



have understanding of; something 
thai we should try lo gam an under- 
standing of, even though many may 
disagree. We recogniw: thai every- 
one has a voice and we want you lo 
come forward and be heard. 

You need not worry about being 
ajoumalism or an English major lo 
feel diat die quality of your writing 
meets the quality of The 
Communieaior. We have helpful 
people on staff who will help you 
with this. 

Your participation in the writ- 
ing of this paper oughi to be 
viewed as an avenue to remedy 
disappointments you may have 
widi die paper. Your participation 
can make a difference. Therefore, 
we invite you to write for any and 
all sections of The 
Communicator, and dien it will 
truly be a sludent newspaper. 

Letters lo the editor, news 
articles, opinions, commentaries, 
sports and features arc open for 
articles at all times. We will help 
those of you who fe«l somewhai 
insecure when it comes lo putting 
pen to paper, and assure you diere 
IS no need to feel insecure because 
we are a paper dial has always and 
continues to strive for inclusion, 
not exclusion. 

We have made it easier for you 
to participate. We have posted a 
suggesiion box outside The 
Communicator door in Walb, Room 
215. We have an E-mail address 
where you can wriie to ir: stupa- 
per@holmcs ipfw.indianaedu We 
also have an open door policy, and 
when ever anyone is in the room 
the door is open for you to come in 
and talk with us. We look forward 
to workmg with you. 



Nameless generation 



Guest 
Columnist 




generation I'm injly surprised that 
no one has named us yet So. 1 
diought I'd take it upon myself to 
name our generation 

Wc are the "Bandwagon 
Generation " By this 1 mean thai as 
soon as something new and inieresl- 
ing comes along, we immediately 
jump on die bandwagon so that we 
can be a pari of this new fad. And 
when our obsession has been com- 
pletely overplayed and exhausted, 
we drop it like a bad babil and 
search for somclhmg else to gnp on 
lo for awbilc 



Take the recent aliernative 
craze. How long do you think ii will 
take until it goes to the same place 
as grtinge and (God willing) Hootie 
and the Blowfish? Perhaps wc 
should be called the "Sponge 
Generation," because we soak up 
everything we touch and then 
squeeze it out all over. We're all so 
obsessed with being cool that there 
IS almost no room lo be an individ- 
ual these days. And people wonder 
why the suicide rate among teens 
increases every year. 

You may be reading this and 
diinking that I'm compleiely full of 
it. Thai's cool; everyone is cntided 
to their own opinion. All! ask is thai 
you think about iL How many peo- 
ple do you know who can truly call 
themselves an individual? My guess 
is you can't unless you're really 
lucky We're jumping on die band- 
wagon all the lime, trying to "fit in 
with the crowd. " and it's ruining us 

This is ail just my opinion 
though, and who die hell am 1, 
right? You decide for yourself what 
to make of this

Downside of 'big university' life 




awaiting the 
days when 

they would be transferring to a "big 
university" lo finish their degree I 
was humored during my two-hour 
wait in line, hearing about their 
exatement of leaving this campus 
and lifeless city. Humored not at 
dieu- decisions, bui at days gone by 
that I had endured at a "big name 
school." 

I remembered how exciied I was 
10 pack everything that I owned and 



lug ii an hour and 20 minutes away. 
The fear for most of us, was living 
widi someone we had only met once. 
Never mind Ihe fact that some were 
surprised to see their roommate had 
purple, or green hair and different 
sexual preferences. Some also want- 
ed black walls while oLhers wanted 
flower wallpaper pasted up. 

1 quickly learned that first move- 
in day that elevators do not neces- 
sanly go lo die top. The building I 
lived in had only transportation lo 
the sixth floor, not convenient for 
those of us who lived on the eighth 
floor Of course, on moving day the 
elevators decided to become 
mechanically challenged, and my 
20-inch television had lo be carried 
up eight flights. 

My firsi real life lesson was 
learning to live in 80-degree weath- 
er with no air-condiuoning. and let's 



noi forget that heal nses. For Uiose 
I have heard complain about walk- 
ing lo and from class, you should try 
walking miles everyday to and from 
your dorm. 

In the first couple of weeks 1 
learned what annoyed me most 
about sharing with a roommate who 
maybe eats all die time, or lalks 
about how freaked out she and her 
friends are. Knowmg how lo man- 
age your temper can be helpful when 
they break your VCR. or stay up 
until 3 a.m. watching Alternative 
Nation, while you try to sleep for an 
8 a.m, aerobics class. Bless dieir 
hearts, when diey may not have lo 
wake up until 2 p.m., but expect you 
to accommodate ihcir quiet hours. 

Yes, this situation was a little 
more than 1 or most students bar- 
gained for and a Hide more than 1 
wanted to spend. What I paid for one 



semcsier at a "big name university," 
I could have paid tor two years here 
at IHFW 

What does this mean? Well, if 
you plan on going away to finish 
your degree remember to compro- 
mise. Plan on sharing one bathroom 
with 70 Other siudenus, plan on every 
door on your floor being open wiih 
blasting music coming out. Plan to 
park a mde off of the campus only 
making it out to your car once a 
week to find it vandalized. Learn lo 
eat mashed potatoes everyday for 
lunch and dinner. Expect to have 
long distance phone bdls numbering 
at least SlOO every mondi Learn lo 
shop at discount stores because you 
wdl be broke. 

My final bit. appreciate where 
you are right now. Be thankful you 
have this chance to pursue higher 
educaiion 



Not Just a cartoonist: John Koenl 



Ebonics: no substitution for book learnin' 



Last December, ihe school 
board in Oakland. California, 
officially recognized die lan- 
guage of Ebonics, or black English, 
Ebonics is characienzcd by die use 
of phrases such as "1 be" and "she 
ain't" instead of "1 am" and ""she 
isn't " Even if the decision to 
acknowledge this deconstrucdon of 
the English language was made to 
decelerate the expanding high school 
dropout rate in Oakland, it still con- 
veys the message that succumbmg to 
subpar standards is acceptable 

With encroaching pop-culture 
coarseness and the "dumbing down" 



of innumerable aspects of our lives 
(has anyone read Tlie News-Seniinel 
funny pages lately?) upon us. dare 
we indulge ourselves further, even in 
the name of multicultural diversity? 

Think for a moment. Why is it 
that if a white person with a soudiem 
accent is heard to say "ah'm plumb 
tuckered out from pllchin' bay inta 
diis here four-by-four pickup." ihey 
might be labeled a "redneck?" The 
underlying answer is that he or she is 
being cnucized for a poor command 
of the English language. 

If modem society is to becixne 
more refined and cultivated, should- 



n't we at least be able lo understand 
each other? Besides, what benefits 
are actually reaped from recognizing 
Ebonies'* 

Sure. Oakland students might 
feel better about themselves right 
now to know diat there is nodiing 
wrong with the way they speak; but 
what about in the future when diey 
can't get hired because of poor com- 
munication skills^ 

Proper education needs to be 
stressed to help ensure a belter future 
for our country. Proper education has 
at its foundaticm accurate verbal and 
writing skills. This fundamental 



learning process must not be like the 
baby that gets dirown out widi the 
bath water. Learning to speak and 
wnie correcdy today truly lays the 
groundwork for a brighter tomorrow. 
Indeed, not only does the social 
acceptance of Ebonics in Oakland 
cause further stress fractures in the 
fault line of America's common 
ground, but it also constitutes a dan- 
gerous lack of foresighi Improper 
grammar must be rejected and 
then corrected by parents and 
teachers alike This procedure must 
noi be forgoiien.

Along with the advertising, recruit- 
ing of staff and handling stories, 
there ls the ever-growing question 
that builds in an editor's mind. 
"What can I do to improve The 
Contmunicaior?" And so my ideas 
began 

First off. 1 want to clanfy that 1 
do not cniicize the work of the past 
editors I admire many of die things 
they did. I dunk my staff and 1 just 
want to expand on ibeir ideas. 
However, there may have been 
things thai we disagree widi. but 
that IS our personal opmion. 

Throughout this semester, our 
main goal is to work on getting 
more people involved li is so im- 
taiing to hear people constantly 
etxnplain about The Communicator, 
yet nobody wants to participate in 
the process of putting together a 



good publication. Considering the 
size of our staff. 1 feel we do about 
as well as we're capable of. It is just 
impossible to do outstanding cover- 
age on events when many times we 
have three or four other stories lo 
wriie. nie lack of wniers al.so draws 
our attention away from aspects 
such as design, editing and getung 
more involved widi the community. 

Our student newspaper needs to 
be a paper diat everyone parilcipaies 
in. otherwise we would be just 
anoUier Fort Wayne Newspaper. So 
we arc reaching out for arlisLs and 
photographers to make our paper 
more appealing to the eye We're 
looking for more computer design- 
ers to create infographs to aid in 
consolidating information. We are 
searching for writers In an attempt 
10 make The Communieaior a news- 
paper widi a number of different 
viewpoinis And this is only the 
beginning. 

The process of wnung Is quite 
simple, when many may think il is a 
large, time-consuming act. When 
becoming a staff writer you are not 
required to submit a story each 
week We work with whai is conve- 
nient for you. even diough we do 
have deadlines. Whether it's report- 
ing on campus events, doing music 
or film reviews, or turning in poetry, 
we are willing to give il a try. 



We encourage your story ideas, 
your photos and simply anything 
that you feel may be beneficial to 
our publication. 

The Communicator staff is 
looking for ways to improve the 
newspaper, and with your input we 
feel thai we are headed in the right 
direction. And if panicipation is not 
your thing, we at least arc asking 
you. die student body, to take a 
glan«; at what we have lo offer you, 
WIdi die changes in design, content 
and aitiiude, wc hope that we may 
finally be accepted as a well- 
grounded publicauon. 

So, as the semester goes on, we 
hope to cover as many events and 
issues as possible m an attempi to 
appeal lo die enure campus Even 
though the decision of content is left 
to the staff, we will try to take your 
recommendations into considera- 
tion We are not here to impress 
everyone, thai would be impossible, 
but we do warn you. our readers, to 
lake pride in whai The 
Communicator offers. 

In conclusion. 1 hope 1997 is a 
year where we can begin to build 
more bridges with professors, stu- 
dent groups and the entire campus 
body Hopefully, The 
Communicator can become a 
promising outlet for publicizing 
your activities.

'Dons lose players due to academics 



By Shannon Flnton 
Chief Reporter 

There are people who would 
like to believe that rules were made 
10 he broken and guidelmes not to be 
followed However this is not die 
case where IPFW and the Athletics 
Department are concerned 

IPFW has specific guidelines in 
accordance with the athletic depart- 
mcnl and the NCAA In order to be 
ehgible to play basketball. sludenLs 
are required to achieve a minimum 
of a 2 GPA in the first semester- 
Three of the four students who fol- 
lowed John Williams, IPFW's cur- 
rent basketball coach, from St 
Francis college to IPFW did not 
meet die current standards or condi- 
tions last semester 

Craedel Key. point guard: 
Charles Porter, forward; and co-cap- 
lain Adam Moore, forward, are dis- 
(fualified from playing basketball 
during the spring semester for 
IPFW. 

"Charles Porter, who is a senior 
will not play at all; it is defmitely 
over for him." said Ja.son Werling, 
guard for the Dons. "They were 
really good kids and good b^l play- 



ers. They were a big pan of the 
team" 

Dave Fairchild, NCAA 
Compliance Coordinator, keeps 
track of all the grades and accumu- 
lative credit hours Grades and 
progress are monitored closely 
Profinency is monitored three times 
dunng the semester, requiring stu- 
dents to take grade sheets to their 
professors the 5di. 8Lh and 11th 
weeks. 

"Our primary focus is always on 
academics, and our secondary focus 
is on adileucs." said Fairchild ■Tn 
he able to identify a problem before 
it gels to be a big problem we send 
those sheets around There wasn't 
anydiing reported Ihal gave us cau.sc 
for concern It was a bit of a surprise 
at die end of die term " Saint 
Francis College is part of Ihe 
National Association of 
Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) 
Their expectations and requiremenLs 
are different which could have 
caused a problem in the transiUon 

Jeff Rekewet, basketball coach 
for Sl Francis, stressed that grades 
are monitored coniinually II is gen- 
erally up to die students to do the 
work, but it is also Ihe job of Ihe 




The mens' basketball learn before 



coach to motivate Ihem in any way 
possible. 

"There arc no checks odier dian 
what the school sends in and it's 
mosdy attendance," said Rekewei. 
"We see how they do on tests 
because we do have a vested inter- 
est, but unfortunately we can't make 
them do die work " 

There was concern for how the 
team would handle the loss Werling 
sldl maintains a positive attitude 

"We shouldn't go down much, 
but stamina is gomg to be a big part 



the spring semester. 
and we will have less players. 1 am 
sure Ihe team will be fine." said 
Werling "Charles was a senior and 
now he's done. Craedel and Adam 
will come back and hopefully start a 
fire. Some wdl play more and tiave 
better opponunilies with us having 
less players," 

It IS a new year and a new begin- 
ning Now the men will have plen- 
ty of lime to pracuce their game 
without the pressure and gei crack- 
ing on die books.

By panicipating in this competi- 
tion, students will leam more about 
this neurological disorder affecting 
young adults, and raise sponsorship

with multiple sclerosis. 

Muluple Sclerosis most often 
does not affect a person until about 
the age of 20. the average age range 
of MS being 20-40 years of age. It is 
a disease of the central nervous sys- 
tem where messages from the brain 
become disrupted, often resulting in 
lost body function 

Symptoms of the disease can 
include blindness, extreme fatigue. 
tremors and varying degrees of 
paralysis. 

MS is the most common neuro- 
logical disorder of young adults. It 



affects as many as 500,000 
Americans. At the present lime there 
is no known cause, cure or preven- 
tion for this disease. 

"This year we just expanded lo 
college students lo promote aware- 
ness there also." said Peter Damiri, 
public relations contaa for MSSA 

Damui's goal is to try and tar- 
get the younger audience and get 
them informed, since it is their age 
group that is mostly affected 

"PauenLs can go years without a 



diagnosis because the symptoms are 
different, People may be able to gel 
to a doctor sooner arid get to a treat- 
menl program quicker. " said

Program introduces new horizons 



by Carmen Roblason 
StflfT Writer 

Bcginrung this semester. IPFW 
Continuing Education will offer a 
four-month certificate program in 
Iravel agent training. 

Three courses are required for 
the ceruficate. These courts are 
duwted towards students who are 
interested in entry-level positions 
in cruise lines, car rental and 
commercial airlines 

An individual with this certifi- 
cate would be competent in the use 
of the American Airlines Sabre 



System, the national computer 
database. 

"IPFW was selected as a site 
by one of the largest trainers of the 
travel industry." said Wade 
Fredrick, executive director of 
Continuing Education. 

The courses offered include 
Travel Career Training (eight 
meetings), Reservaaon Computer 
Training, (12 meetings), and 
Geography, (seven meetings) 
Materials such as workbooks and 
the use of computers are included 
in the fee for each course 

Primum Travel Company will 



provide training as welt as job 
placement services at the comple- 
tion of the course work. The com- 
pany is ba.scd m Ft. Worth. Texas. 
and instructs similar travel agent 
courses in 40 stales." said Stephen 
Gatlin, president of Primum 

Gailin is optimistic about 
offering these kinds of courses and 
growth in the travel industry 

According to the Office of 
Consumer Affairs, "The US will be 
the largest travel industry by the 
year 2000." 

"Another advantage about hav- 
ing a certificate program at IPFW 



is that individuals are not required 
to pay one large amount." said 
Fredrick, "Instead, they may pay 
for each cla.ss individually " 

Fredrick feels ihe program is 
economical 

"Students can usually expect to 
pay, nation-wide, (approximately) 
S3000 for a Iravel agent program." 
said Frednck 

Students interest m more infor- 
mation about the program can call 
for Primum Company information
