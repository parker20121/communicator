Programs cut; others in danger 



by Mishanna Wood, 
Managing Ecfitor 



Results were released b) Ihc Indiana 
Commlsiion for Higher Education (ICflEI on 
May 14 about inrormaiion gathered Trom a 
periodic study of degree programs ihai have 
had fciv graduates In the past live years. 

ICME found 24 programs at IPBV that Had 
rewcr than 10 graduates In the past Tivc years 
and subsequently were put on a list that rec- 
ommended them for elimination in December. 
Some of the programs included music therapy, 
French, German, fine arts, metllnil dentistry, 
pre-dentistty ami pre-medicine. 

At the dme, it was uncertain whether ICIIE 
had the power to eliminate degree programs, 
but ICME went ahead and released their r(^su1ts 
to various state Insiiiutlons. A total of 435 
degree programs were facing possible recom- 
mendations of elimination statewide. 

According to Susan Hannah, Interim vice 
chancellor of Academic Affairs, IPRV is cur- 
rently working with lU Bloomington and 



Purdue West Ljfajettc on the situation. 

Miles Brand. lU president, and Steven 
Beering, Purdue president, w.ote to ICHE and 
informed them that they diti not have the legal 
authority to eliminate programs, said Hannah. 
The presidents told ICHE that their universities 
would conduct Internal reviews of the pro- 
grams ICHE recommended for elimination 
because only the Boards of Trustees for iU and 
Purdue have the power to make the decision to 
cut programs at the universities. 

The only rationale that ICHE has given to 
the Institutions about why they want to cut 
programs is due to the desire to demonstrate 
efficiency in university operations, said Jack 
[&gt;ah1, associate vice chancellor for Institutional 
Research and Analysis. 

So far, five Purdue progratris will be cut 
at IPFW. Purdue programs have been the only 
programs cut thus far, due to the manner in 
which the internal review process Is being 
handled. 

"I don't want this to be misunderstood.

by CarrieAnne LeaUiers, 
News EdJlcK 



Members of the business community and faculty will 
be brought together with students at the first ever 
Mastodon Roast on SepL 16 at the McKay Farm in order to 
visit and make career connections. 

"For students, this is an opportunity to make a more 
personal connection with their professors and to also con- 
nect with alumni tor potential employment and career 
mentoring," said Jennifer Bosk, Director of Alumni 
Relations. 

Free beer, wine, pop and hors d'oeuvres will be 
scrv'cd, but because alcohol will be served in accordance 
with the new policy, only students over 21 will be admit- 
ted. Those planning to attend need to RSVP to Alumni 
Relations at 4S1-&amp;B0T.

opportunity for students to connect with 
professors and future employers and for employers to con- 
nect with future employees." Bosk said. 

Currently, there are about 30.000 IPFW alumni, 200 of 
whom work on campus, many of whom are planning to 
attend, as well as the nearly 45 faculty members who have 
already committed to attending the event. 

"This Is a wonderful opportunity for everyone. The 
faculty arc such a big draw for the alumni and t really 
think they are for the students, too," Bosk said. 

The event is a result of the efforts of Chancellor 
Michael Warteli and Alumni Relations. Wartcll put a lot of 
effort Into getting the event because of the importance he 
sees in alumni relations with students. 

"It's because of the generosity of the Chancellor that 
we are able to do this and it's because he feels very strong- 
ly about our alumni relations within the community,' Bosk 
said.

by CarneAnne Lealhsrs, 
News Erfitor 



Upon the recommendations of Chancellor Michael Warteli 
and Interim Vice Chancellor for academic affairs Susan Hannah, 
the appointment of Roberta Wiener as Dean of the IPFW School 
of Education was approved by the Purdue University president 
and board of trustees. 

Wiener is filling the post vacated by Betty Steffy who 
accepted a position in the College of Education at Iowa State 
Universlt&gt;- last fall. Wiener was attracted to the unlvcrslij' by 
the faculty and by IPFW's relationship with Fort Wayne 
Community Schools IFWCS). 

'I thought the faculty here was superb. I was really 
Impressed with the faculty here and I still am. They have 
tremendous dedication and involvement," Wiener said. There's 
excellent Involvement between the community and the

literacy from Hofstra University in 1973, a master's degree In 
social work from Adelphl University In 1986. a master's degree

and education in 1957 from Brooklyn College. Prior to coming 
to IPFW, she was the chair of education studies at Adelphi 
UniversiO' in Garden City, N.Y. 

Ai IPFW, she is hoping to help the faculty reach their goals, 
increase graduate student enrollment and master's degree grad- 
uate programs and also to continue the relations between IPFW 
and FWCS. 

Wiener Is also very interested In teaching students to read 
through the use of children's literature. 

"You've got students hooked if you can get students to 
enjoy children's literature," Wiener said. "I'd Uke to incorporate 
this type of teaching more into some of the classes here." 

Wiener specializes in literacy and reading. She is also a 
therapist working with youth and families and has a sub-spe- 
cialty in substance abuse. She is ctjrrcntly working on a new 
book UUcd: "Kids Who Kill: Violence and Aggression In Children

her recent textbook, "Literacy Portfolios: Using Assessment to 
Guide Instruction." 

"I would love for students to drop in and say hello. I'd lov-c 
to know what's on their minds. I really do have an open door 
policy," Wiener said.

Grotc, complrolicr ai IPFW, Purdue 
West LaTayeuc began Uils type of ser- 
vice a fesv yean ago. This ser.-icc has 
now been expanded in IPFW. 

Under the policy, the areas In 
which the coniumpiion of alcoholic 
beverages arc allowed Include VValb 
Union, Williams Thcaire and the 
McKay Farm property. The presence 
of alcohol will only exist In these loca- 
tions during closed,

the niajority of ihose In 
attendance arc 21 years 
of age. The university 
Iio must approve the 
vent and alcohol can- 
ot be the main bever- 
ge available. 
Those consuming alco- 
ollc beverages must 
tay within the vicinity 
of the event. In addl- 
to approving alco- 
at an event, IPFW 
t also approve an 
alcohol vendor. Currently, 
Aramark Is ihc onlj' vendor 
apprtn'ed to serve alcohol 
icampus. 
Student organizations, 



will help attract more events to the 
campus. According to Branson, ser\'- 
ing alcohol on campus will let IPFW 
keep events on campus that are being 
held elsewhere. 

Branson said that bringing events 
to campus is Important as IPFW con- 
tinues to work to increase its level of 
awareness to the community. The

really need alcohol to do this, though? 

Grote said alcohol may be sen'cd 
at events such as wedding receptions, 
award dinners and formal events such 
as the legislative luncheon. 

We have found from our own 
experiences that alcohol is a typical 
beverage at a wedding, not, for exam-

socializing. A ceremony or conference 
is a formal meeting. We don't feel that 
when one thinks of an academic 
establishment that it should be associ- 
ated with alcohol. 

We aren't worried about wild par- 
ties on the campus every weekend. 
We are worried about conferences 
cing held here solely 
purpose of alcohol. There has

IPFW are 21 years of age. 

According (o Crote, alco- 
hol is an expected service at 
some events. We believe that 
If alcohol is an expected ser- 
vice and a part of the ceremo- 
ny or conference that everj- 
one should be involved. Not 
everyone can legally drink 
alcohol. 

For example at the 
Mastodon Roast, only those 
who are at least 21 years of 
age can attend due to the 
presence of free beer. During

students cannot attend this

Is this fair? 




Perhaps the problems that can be 
associated with the presence of aico' 
hoi will be very minimal We hope that 
the community does become more 
involved with IPFW, not for the alco- 
hol but for the purpose of the event. 



Problems on campus easily solved 



by Andrew Welch. Staff Writer 

After two years of attending 
IPFW, I have now realized that some 
of the problems we hear our friends 
(Hiking about arc just tiny things we 
could avoid.. .some of them. 

Fini and foremost. I find it difll- 
cult. almost on a daily basis, to find 
a parking spot where I want one 
(that li, until It seems as if half of 
the students have dropped out or 
Slopped showing up). The thing is, if 
I don't get a parking spot where I 



know there is a possibility of not 
finding a parking spot where I want 
one, I leave early for school or Just 
go straight to those lots. What could 
a little exercise hurtJ Someone once 
told me about the parking "situa- 
tion" we have here at IPFW and I 
acted as if 1 did nut have time for 
that nonsense. The thing ii, it's not 



ing spot, or one close to it, but it just 
Is not going to happen e\'er&gt;' time. 

Another problem many of us 
are having these Urst few weeks of 
school is getting used to the new 
computer system. At first, I did not 
"kc the whole idea at all, but 



I have

ay, have plentj of free spots), 1 ,

all in the long run. With newloglns 
and passwords to get into the com- 
puter system, it will keep non-stu- 
dents off the IPFW computers (that 
Is, if no one logs out incorrectly or 
gives out his or her login and pass- 
word freel&gt;). 

Apparently, last Tuesday, Aug. 
31, apparently there was a major 



computer networking problem: one 
which will benefit us all once it is 
worked out, but it will just take a lit- 
tle more patience. 

Patience... something that a lot 
of ui lack entering this new millenni- 
um. How much do we get accom- 
plished by griping about the issues? 
Well, two parking garages didn't 
help (he parking situatioii 1i5o rnucK 
because one of them is hardly used 
and the computer system will not

Legislating Respect 

by Nancy Simmonds, Staff Writer 

In addition to the three R's of Reading. Writing and 
Arithmetic, students In the si:ite of Louisiana must add a 
fourth R. that of Respect. In July, the Louisiana government 
passed the Student Respect Law. Students in grades K 
through n\'e must address their teachers and school admln- 
IstraiorTi by "Sir" or "Ma'am" or by their title of Mr., Mrs. or 
MIsj. In the year 2000, the sl.xth grade must comply and an 
addiUonal grade is added undl 2006. when all high school 
seniors will be Included. Each school is responsible tor 
enforcement, although suspension and expulsion ore not an 
option. 

Democradc Senator Donald Cravins authored the bill in 
responic to comments and concerns voiced by his wife, a 
retired school teacher. As with any further restrictions on 
ptirsonal freedom, reaction has been overwhelmingly nega- 
tive. Teachers have complained they are being cursed In 
their classrooms. Enforcing the sarcastic 'Yes, Ma'am" Is not 
high on their list of priorities. 

Students say respect is not given, but earned: an "I 
won'i-respect-you-until-you-respect-me* attitude. 
Admin is ira tori are saying that the problem Is not a lack of 
nispect In the classroom, but a lack of training. I think this 
leglilation could be a stepping stone to more widespread 
counesy and respect. We hold so lightly to our pride in 
who we are and in our self-importance that we often fail to 
acknowledge the measure of greatness In others. 

Students may be coneci in sajing that respect must be 
earned; however, when we respect other people, they 
respond In kind. A young man. a student from IVY Tech, 
came Inio the Information office regarding roommate 
advertising. Twice he used the word "Ma'am.' Why did I 
respond so warmly to him! To many, being on the receptive 
side of "Ma'am* Is a sign of growing old. Not a welcome 
prospect, bui I responded from the heart because he 
acknowledged my Importance in some way. 

That same day a faculti' member came to the office to 
use the campus phones. She reached over my desk and 
rifled through my reference materials looking for the num- 
ber she needed. There was no acknowledgment of my pres- 
ence other than "t need a pen" in the middle of her phone 
conversation. Was there a warm response on ray part? 
tlanJIy. For the sake of my job, I was glad she couldn't read 
my mind. 

This legislation attempts to address a growing problem 
In our society. Although a state law seems extreme, 
wouldn't learning courtesy and respect have a marked 
effect on the violent actions and reactions that prevail 
today? If we continually wait for someone else to act kindly 
first, or If we give only when we have recched, that always 
puts the responilblllty on someone else. 

These students in K through six will all too soon grow 
to be the adults we see in our classrooms, our bookstore 
and our parking lots. We are not children. Isn't it time we 
took counesy and respect upon ounelves? Louisiana may 
need a state law to mind their manners. Do we? 



The end of the Beanies: A welcomed change 



by Mishanna Wood, Matiaging Editor 

last Tuesday, Aug. 31, Ty Inc., locat- 
ed in Westmoni, III., made an announce- 
ment that had a tremendous effect on the 
collectors of Beanie Babies. As of Dec. 31, 
1959. Beanie Babies (small, plush toys 
filled with synthetic beads which first 
came on the market In 1993) will no 
longer be produced. Ty representatives 
have not commented on whether or not 
production of the 'bean creatures" will 
cease permanently. 

Discontinued Beanies have the high- 
est prices of ail. According to the Bean 
Ust-Bcanies In the news, sales and trade 
llst-Scamore the Seal sells for S175, Web 
die Spider is going for S700 and Peking 
the Panda Is going tor a whopping 
S2.300II Holy Cowl That amount of money 
would pay for my tuition and some of my 
books. I think I should go find a Panda 
Bear and sell it to a Beanie collector. Ylkes! 

Most people have some type of collec- 
tion whether It is Beanie Babies, stamps. 
coins or butterflies. It seems that cverj-one 
has a collection of something whether 
they arc aware of It and if It's valuable or 
not. So people like collecting things. Great. 
According to varied news reports, chat 
rooms and collector websites are going 
berserk over Beanie Babies. They are cre- 
ating a huge commotion about something 
which is literally a tiny bag of pellets. 

When I think of Beanie Babies, 1 think 
of my cousin who attends Moorehead 
State and works part-time at a Hallmark 
store in Fargo, N.D. 

We had a conversation about her 
sales clerk position at Hallmark before the 
"big announcement' was made. One of 
the tasks involved with her job is the sell- 



ing of Beanie Babies. It never occurred to 
me that selling toys could be such a pain. 1 
thought working at a Hallmark store 
would be Ideal due to the discounts on 
cards, books and seasonal decorations. I 
couldn't undentand why her job could be 
so distressing until I heard some of her 
Beanie Baby horror stories. The collectors 

According to my cousin, the manager 
at her store puts new Beanies on the 
shelves twice a day, once a week. The 
manager docs this to avoid a mob at the 
counter. This method could vary at other 
stores. I only know what happens in the 
store In which she is employed. People will 
call anywhere from live to ten limes In a 
day, asking when the new Beanies will hit 
the shelves. Collectors will often hang out 
in the store for hours walling for Beanies. 
They push, shove and name-call each 
other and fight for places in line. During 
one episode of bean bag mania, a woman 
went off on a tangent al my cousin for one 
hour concerning her place in line for the 
last new Beanie available In the store. 

These collectors arc usually in their 
30s or older. I would think people of that 
age would have jobs, children, a life and 
some manners. Go hang out with your 
kids, wash your dogs or enjoy your day 
off from work. Don't hang out at the 

are found and harass the sales clerks. 
Beanie Babies are hot items and they 
probably do bring In a decent amount of 
money to these establishments, but collec- 
tors should calm down. 

Obviously they see It as a sport, [who 
has the mosl Beanies and who can acquire 



them the fastest) or an Important hobby 
(Beanies arc a part oF history) and an 
investment (which ones can I sell for the 
most money). I think there are much more 
interesting and important things to collect 
other than Beanies. They don't do any- 
thing, they have not helped the world 
(well, they have made their creators rlcti) 
and they will probably be a thing of the 
past in five years. The Cabbage Patch Kids, 
trolls. Tickle Me Elmo and Teddy Ru.xpin 
had their days. So will the Beanies. 

I think people should start coilecdng 
something closer to the heart that they 
have created such as paintings or pictures. 
They are worth a lot more than money. 

No one knows for sure why Ty has 
decided to stop producing Beanies. Some 
people believe production has stopped so 
that the value of the Beanies will Increase. 
According to The Bean List, The End Bear, 
a black bear with a gold collar and a gold 
emblem on its chest will be the last Beanie 
to hit the markeL Since ever&gt;one seems to 
have at least one Beanie, how are they 
going to be valuable? For instance. Smart 
Collectors, a collecting website, reported 
that there arc 77 Beanies that are consid- 
ered to be overproduced. Fifty-three are 
retired and 24 arc current. These crea- 
tures can be purchased on the Internet at 
Metaexchangccom for Tive dollars or less. 

Beanie Babies are cute little animals 
for the office, car or a kid's bedroom. 
However. I believe three is enough and 
five is an abundance. I own one. For the 
mosl part, 1 wish Beanies good-bye and 
good riddance. I think It is quiie obvious 
that the world docs not need anymore 
Beanies or demanding collectors.

'The Muse' proves 
uninspired 



by Nancy Simmonds, 
Guest Writer 



According to mythology, 
the muses are women of 
power. Oaughters of Zeus and 
granddaughters of the Earth 
and the Sky, these nine 
women are inspiration for 
artists, musicians, poets, histo- 
rians, astronomers and play- 
wrights. Not one is named 
Sarah. 

In Albert Brooks' comedy 
-The Muse.- Brooks plays 
Stephen Phillips, a screen- 
writer who has lost his edge. 
Facing professional rejection 
on all sides, he turns to his 
successful friend. Jack Warrick 
Ijeff Bridges), who introduces 
him to Sarah [Sharon Stone). 
To Jack, as well as Martin 
Scorsese, Rob Reiner and 
James Cameron, she Is their 

All gods reqtjirc sacrificial 
offerings. Sarah prefers hers 
from Tiffany's. 

Considering Sarah a good 
"Investment," Stephen appeas- 
es her every request in the 



hope that she will inspire him 
to greatness or at least suc- 
cess. He get! her a hotel room 
at Four Seasons for S1700 per 
night and delivers midnight 
carryout from Spago. 

Eventually Sarah feels 
more comfortable living in 
Stephen's own home and her 
Inspiration Is transferred to 
Stephen's wife, Laura [Andie

Kelly's Video Vault picks Peter Jackson

SlaH Writer 



Welcome lo The Video 
Vault. Here you will gain 
Inilghc Into the tvorld or cine-

Is. In every edition, I will

This wcci;'5 spotlight Is 
on Director Peter Jackson. 
The New Zealand born direc- 
tor is far from being in the 
limelight, but his time Is 
quickly approaching. A few of 
his twisted i;ems that you 
should check out are 
"Braindcad." "Heavenly 
Creatures- and "The 
Frighicncrs." 

"Braindcad" (known In 
the U.S. oj "Dead Alive") has 
to be one of the goriest films 



than thai. The film plays on 
the stercotipe of the o\'crpro- 
teciivc and demanding moth- 
er, much like Hitchcock's 
"Psycho." The main charac- 



more demanding after she Is 
bitten by a Sumatran Rat 
Monkey. This bite turns the 
mother into a zombie, ivho in 
turn changes other people 
into zombies. The son tries to 
subdue the zombies, but tr.cn- 
tually it gels lo be too much 
for him. This is where chaos 
reigns. If you're In the mood 
for a good hour and a half of 
blood splattering, this is defl- 
nitelj' the movie for &gt;ou. Oh, 
and there are also a few good 
laughs, too. Rating:?
