Next ycur, when undone wunls 
to criticize or praise the COMMIi- 
NlCATOfl, he will have l«o people 
to deiil with. Tommy Mcncely and 
Jnnet Weaver will carry the res- 
ponsibility as cu-editors. This 

dny by the Publications Hoard. 

Both girls, I.U. freshmen, have 
hod extensive high school Jour- 
nulisni experience. They both ser- 
ved ns editor of their respective high 
school newspapers, and belong lo 
the Quill and Scroll Honor Scoeity 
for High School Journalists. 

In addition to high school ex- 
perience, both have worked .on 
arcu doily newspapers. Miss Me- 
neely served as a news corres- 
pondent for the Terre Hiiule Tri- 
bune Star and worked in the adver- 
tising department of the Auburn 
Star. 

Miss Weuvcr wus involved with 
the Wabash Plain Dealer as hi^h 
Hthool corrcspondend and worded 
school correspondent and worked 
for the Auburn F.vening Slur in the 
edituriul and advertising dcparl- 
mcnls. She was also NurlhfieM 
High School's student reporter 
for nOffO radio. 

Die idea of a co-editorship, 
says Frank -Xkey. ehuimiiin of the 
Publicalions Board, was initiated 
bccuuse of the similarity of both 
girl's pctilioni, their abilUy lo 
work together, and the fact that an 
editorship is exhausting for a 
single person. 

Currenlly Miss Meneoly is the 
Communicator's Advertising Man

Fcuiurc. Editor. The two girls were 
selected over two other applicants

NO HELP OR THANKS 
FROM YOU!!!!!! 



BY THE EDITOR-IN-CHIEF 



rite 



For two years now I've known I'd have to 
my so-cal led good-bye or farewel I editorial . 
I've thought about it and written it in my mind 
a million times and now here it is; the last is- 
sue, deadline long overdue, and I do n't have it 
done . I ' ve had th i ngs to do and I ' ve found th I ngs 
to do. I ' ve gotten so desperate that I even did 
some homework rather than write this thing. I've 
got to do It now . 

I've never agreed with the word godd-bye. 
It's a word that makes no sense. I've never 
found, never anywhere in my entire life, any- 

Thing "good" in a good-bye. I never have and 

I never will and I never want to, for good- 

,Tye to me is a rotten thing and it doesn't ex- 
ist, I don ' t want it to . 

Well, I've got to face facts, I've got to 
writp this thing. HowV Should ' write about 
the great things, the wondertui help, the con- 
structive criticism, the fantastic people and 
lie. Should 1 write about the down-grad i ng , 
the constant criticism, never' one good moment 
3nd lie. Or should I tell it like it is and 
use all the pages of the paper; which would be 
no good because nobody would read It anyway. 
Or shall I try and see what comes, like live- had 
to do in the past? 

In September of '69 I started at this cam- 
pus as a freshman, also as managing editor of 
the lU-PU COMMUNICATOR. I never thought I 
could have it so good . Within five weeks the 
Editor had quit and I appointed my self acting 
Editor,, for I didn't want It to fold. I did 
not know I had to go th rough things like the 
^'uD I i cat i ons Board to become official. So I 
put out an issue, and I worked, and put out 
an issue, Publications 'Board said "okay, stay 
acting Editor" and I put out some more issues 
and I got a group of people together and put 
out some more issues. We worked, put out another 
issue. Publications Board requested a defi- 
nite official editor-in-chief and I put out 
another issue, fought for a place as editor 
and put out another issue. In December, 
Dec. 22 to be exact, the' Publ icatlons Board 
made me the official Editor-in-Chief of the 
nj-PU COMMUNICATOR-. 

Changing from acting editor to Official ed- 
it "-r wasn't too much different except this time 
I i^-iew that a lot of the threats over my head 
31 this time could not be carried out now that 
I was official editor. But at the same 1 1 me 
I also rs-a lized whati was doing to my self. I 
jiss dehumanizing myself. I was making myself 
iito a machine, something that was trying to 
rl'Base everyone, to do the right thing con- 
stantly, to_ become stable and reliable, to try 
and be perfect, to try the impossible, but to 
Mr/. . . and to try for EVERYBODY and not just 
^ few.-

justified it manually on manual typewriters, we 
laid it, we stapled it together, we had it run 
off on 8i by II sheets of paper in the copy cen- 
ter. But we came out every week. And we came 
out. We sweated, we came out, we worked SO bard, 
and we came out. We put out a paper EVERY week. 

Summer came and I didn't stop work . A I ot of 

my staff had left and 1 still wanted to work, 

I still wanted to click myself, to whirrrrr, and 
to continue as a machine: to please, to please, 
to please. . . EVERYBODY. 

In the summer I found a printer, made up my 
budget, cot bids for the printership of the pa- 
per, opened up the of'ice, bought things for 
the office out of my own money, started up 
staff meetings, advertising plans, make-uo 
plans, worked my fool head off at orientation 
to get a staff and on Sept. 14, Volume 2 Issue 1 
of the 1970 COMMUNICATOR was born. With a 
staff of II we began and we put a paper, and 
we worked, and we put out a oaper, we sweated, 
and we put out a oaper, and we ar°w and we pro- 
gressed and we built ourselves "AND WE PUT 
OUT A PAPER."

Goodbye continued from page 2 



We hought a lot of s+uff ourselves, we were 
scared, I was scared that we'd rjn out of money 

again get a rotten deal like we'd gotten last 

year. This time It wasn't going to happen. 
We bought equipment to do the manual labor our- 
selves. We worked hard. It was rotten, crummy, 
but we did It and we put out a paper. And we 
worked and put out a paper. We were official 
and we put out a paper. And It came out 
every week. 

Vacation came, I worked through it. We 
put out a paper. There was always a handful 
of us out he re a week before school would 
start up in order to get ready to put out the 
paper. A lot of us grumbled but nobody ever 
walked out or quit. We had the GUTS, the guts, 
to stay and please and try and succumb to every- 
one's wishes, and do anything and become part 
of the machine, my machine, me. 

And we've gone through another semester. No 
one helped on the outside. They criticized, 
■leughed, and Jeered, and criticized, laughed 
and jeered, and criticized, laughed and jeered, 
and criticized and laughed. . . but nobody 
quit. And we grew and we strengthened outselves-. 
We we re n't run by certain professors or certain 
groups. We were I niJependant . We relied on no- 
body. Yet if an Issue came out Monday Instead 
of Friday there were constant calls and constant 
requests: where Is it. Where Is It, WHERE IS 
IT? 

Yet we were criticiezed, stepped on, kicked, 
jeered, and laughed at and cri 1 1 c I zed .and Jcri - 
ticlzed and criticized. Those who sat back and 
could open their famous mouths so well could not 
get their bods out to T-20 to help one tiney 
stitch. But their mouths could go and go and 
go.- And I still wish they'd go and take their 
mouths and . 

And now I'm leaving. After two years of a 

newspaper coming out every week after two 

years of trying and clicking, and whirring, 
and doing, and trying, and pleasing, and 
trying, and pleasing, and trying, and pleasing, 
and trying and I I sten i n . . . 1 'm going. A lot of 
the old staff members are going. We're not 
quitting we have to go. 

And the ironic thing of it Is that there is 
going to be TWO editors next year instead of 
one. The Publications Board has decided to be- 
come pro -newspaper instead of against It. 
Members of the Publications Board are taking the 
two editors around to introduce them to the 
"right people". The printer is giving them 
hints on lay-outs. There is help cropplgg up out 

of everywhere help 1 never had. There is 

money lying around everywhere with a $6,000 
budget for next year. And there's the title 
"COMMUNICATOR" on a silver platter being handed 
over. 

Yet there is no guarantee (although there 
was one In the past years) if the newspaper will 
come out every week. Will it? Can YOU tell me 
now? Will it? And. yet you people decided to 

change to not criticize but to help, to move, 

^o qrow and to proqre_ss. w i th the paper. Will 
it come out every week? EVERY WEEK? WIN you 
stick with it? Will no one quit? You tell me 
now for I want to know. 

1 want to know where the guts, the sweat, 
the work, the trying, the machines, and the 
clicking and the whirring is going to come 
from. I want to know NOW. I want you&gt; to 
promise me that you are going to do a good job 

'cause it has never been done in the past 

quote--quote--quote. 

I want to know now. I want you to blast 
it to me right this second. You almighty gods 

who know so much 1 want to know now! Can you 

guarantee It? Can you guarantee it like I had 
the guts to guarantee it? Can you promise It to 
me like I had the guts to promise it to you? 
Can you whirr and dike and succumb to every- 
body tike I had the guts to whirr and click 
and succumb to you? Tell me now. I want to know. 

I'll end here there's no reason to qo on.

MUGGLEFI!!!.flARTYM- 

And now the time has come. As with all of 
life's experiences, this one is ending never 
to return again in just this form. This semester 
can never be repeated nor relived. For me It 
has been a time of meeting new people, making 
new friends, and sharing new experiences. Some 
of you will be back next Fall; others will never 
return. Some will be at other schools, while. some 
will be through with schools. A couple of you 
will be In some foreign country fighting for 
democracy, while others of you will be In Jails 
for having tried the same thing at home. 

But, no matter where you are, you will re- 
member the experiences which are now coming to 
an end. You will remember how many new friends 
you made through chance meetings; you will re- 
member how many old friends you lost through 
minor disagreements. You will recall the good 
and the bad. I hope that for you, as for me, 
the good outweighs the bad. I hope that, where- 
ever you are when you recall these days, Muggle 
and I form a small portion of the pleasant part 
of your memori es . 

Many of you have asked me who Muggle Frumo 
Is. You may be surprised to learn that each of 
you has seen him every single day, though few of 
you have recognized him. If you look very closely 
next time, you will see Muggle Frump. ..in you. 
You see, he Is that part of you that wants to 
smile when you are hurting. He Is that little 
something that makes you want to get back up 
when you fell down. He- Is that little voice that 
says you are not alt that bad when you are on 
a bummer; he is also that little voice that 
says you are not all that good when you are 
ego -tripping. Muggle laughs at you when you are 
Mr. eig, and he tells you that there are mil- 
lions better than you at whatever you are doing. 
But, he also reminds you that the Man has his 
eye on you when you are Mr. Small, and that 
you are special to Him, and unique. 

Muggle was born in a warplane a few years 
back, while we were experiencing a serious In- 
f light emergency. A-h the time, no one on board 
felt we could get back to land, since we only 
had four hours of fuel left, and shore was some 

five hours away right through the middle of 

3 winter storm raging over the North Atlantic. 
As we flew along, hoping to get as close to 
shore as possible before crashing Into the sub- 
Continued 

coming out of the steel machine and getting 
back into a human warm body. I'm dorng natural 
things. I'm not caring quite as much. I'm not 
trying quite as hard. I'm start ing to get in to 
the mood to become a human again as of Friday 
when that newspaper hits the stands, When 1 
don ' t have to try anymore to p I ease everybody , 
and I -don't have- to be on my knees and be kicked 
and be put down farther after I'm al ready down . 
No, now I'm getting In the mood because I'm 
go ing to move, breathe, live, sleep, eat, walk, 
talk and study like a human. I'm gonng to be a 
student- a student -a real I I ve student. Not 3 
machine and not an editor. 

I don't regret it. 1 wanted It. I willed It 
on myself. I will never regret it for as long 
as I live. I can only look back on it with 

happy memories. I must clarify that 1 must 

make you understand. I got myself in to It and 
now I'm leaving. 1 don't want to leave. 1 don't 
want to leavel Yet things change and progress

Can you guarantee it to me that you will be 
as important, as strong, as pertinent and as 
dependable as my staff and I have made the

Can vou?

Muggle Frump continued from page 3- 

freezing water, I realized I was dead- '^s I 
looked down at those whitecapped ocean waveSf 
they seemed to be hands beckoning through, the 
cl ouds . "Come down," they said. " 'cause we own 
you now . We gonna eat you up." But, the winds 
shifted and we made It. Climbing out of that 
airplane, I looked over my shoulder and saw 
Mugg le Frump for the first time. He was laughing 
as I touched the runway with my feet, ...then 
my knees, ...then my lips. As I kisded the ice 
covered concrete, I began to I augh too , for I 

realized I was free yes, Freel j- had died 

out there over the ocean, and death no longer 
owned me. I had been a Jesus Freak for a long 
time, but up until then I had tried to defend 
Him Instead of letting Him do the heavy work. 
Since then, I have known that It Is all His :.i 
thing and keep a sharp eye out for sparks to 
let me know where it's at, Vou may be pleasantly 
surprised to consider that salvation. Cm, HozoJ I , 
WIrvana, Truth, Love, and a lot more, are synon- 
ymous te rms no matter what the denomlnatlon- 

allsts say. It seems that everybody pushed Jesus 
but Jesus. Jesus pushes Truth, and Love, and 
Compassion, and embarrassing things like that. 
This dark brown Jew has something worthwhile 
to say to a! I of us, and he says It In the 
Torah, the Koran, the Bible, the Heart, The 
Brain, and in Nature. Al I you have to do Is 
open up, and the Big Fallow will let you know 
what It Is all about. Dig It, Tf He made the 
world In seven days (give or take a few billion 
trillion). He can surely find a way to make 
iT with you, through any one of "seven times 
seventy times" ways. So, grab a bottle of 
Boone's Farm, find a soft tree to lean on, and 
join Muggle and me as we set about to contem- 
plate the really important things In life. See 
you i n the Fa I I .

voting was to begin. I was totally 
unaware of any preparations that 
the previous chairman had made. 
I arote up the ballot that night 
(Tuesday nighljwith Jim De Fron- 

I read the rules which hud been

and this all the information I had 
to work on. I typed the ballot leilh

By 
of the 



Scott 
Commur 



in the May 7th 1 
cator, Mr. John SImerman, defeated candidate 
for Student Body President, asked the question, 
"What the hel 1 gives?" 

Since he was a candidate for Student Body 
President, one would.be Inclined to assume 
that John would have a little knowledge of ' 
Student Government and "what gives." Alas, 
John's knowledge of Student Government Is, In 
fact, I Ittle. 

On the basis of five assumptions enumer- 
ated In his editorial, John suggested that 
J2800 of student act i vl tymoney has been il- 
legally allocated to the Black Student Union. 
John's suggestion Is Incorrect. In fact three 
of John's assumptions are Incorrect. Such In- 
accuracy can be justified, however, as John did 
state, "Admittedly, I cannot claim all of 
these points to be facts." Ah well, who 
cares about facts anyway? 

John's first point, that Student Body Pre- 
sident Scott Gllle Is graduating In June Is 
true. As is his statement that I am seeking 
a position with the Mayor's Metropolitan Hu- 
man Relations Commission. His third point, 
that Euoene Fullmore wrote a letter to the NEWS- 
SENTINEL insinuating that I am a racist is to- 
tally false. There was no such letter. John's 
fourth point, that I took quick action to In- 
surethat I not be branded a racist by giving the 
Black Student Union money, is false also. John's 
fifth point that the members of the Student 
Assembly approved an allocation toiBlack Student 
Union because the members were fearful of 
being branded racists. Is a clever but mis- 
taken po i nt. 



tulip tree and Jim DeFrunza votc.\. 
[sst. Dean Jounni; Lantz said that 
it should br left up la the people 
in charge ../ the election. Al this. 
Jim Bvlingcr and the three slu- 
d-'nts decided on the grounds that 
a tree wasn't a student: and that 
since Jim Dc Fron'.o was a faculty 
member and also ineligible to re- 
ceive prizes or awards: that they 
would throw out (/it tree's vote.i us 
well as Jim DcFronzo's and give 
the second place to the girl with 
the next highest votes. (The tree 
was second in the balloting— l)e 
Fronzo didn't place.) When I was 
handed the enirelopr.'i ttnd told 
what they hud done and why. I also 
concurred. Sow with some hind- 
sight. I see that this wasn't the 
procedure thai should have been 
token. The tree should have been 
recognized as having come in se- 
cond in the contest and then il 
should have been explained about 
our interpretation of the univer- 
sity policy concerning awards. This 
would have given the haak Walton 
League people and I.S,U. students 
a ehancc to prolesl in significant 
lime. Il was not until after the 

Izaak \i„llon League had demanded 
a recount that I understood the 
I.S.V. and haak Saltan's inter- 
pretation, i.e.. since they ore slu- 
deuls paying activities fees, they 
deserved representation, then they 
found out that ike tulip tree had 
actually been the second place 
winner, they demanded a recount to 
make sure that it didn't actually 
will the contest. By some misun- 
derstanding, the ballots were de- 
stroyed after being tallied. This 
leuec!, us no way of proving the 
election results definitely. In 



this elect 



, the 



I.S I', students 
and haak falton League menbcrs 
were discriminated against. -Il a 
meeting in Asst. Dean Joanne 
Lanlz-s office. sludent.-i from the 
Student Government, Student 
Union Board. J^aac \ialton , and 
I.S.U- cQllcclively came to the 



&gt; that the 



should 



be declared invalid publicly . The 
Student Union Board rannol 
prove its results of the contest, 
llarbarorbar Days is already over 
and in order to right things we had 
no alternative but to declaro the 
election invalid, 

■ At this point I would like to 
apologize formally on behalf of 
the S.U.B. to all those oeoole in- 
volved in this past Harbararbar 
Day Queen contest. A special a-, 
polagy to Izaac , Walton League, 
LS.U. and all three girls: June 
Raudenbush. Elaine Miller and 
Georgjean fjasclton who were de- 
clared the winners of the contest. 
I realize that all of the sponsoring 
organizations have spent a lot of 
valuable lime and money in their 
contest efforts; I only hope thai 
we may all learn from the contest's 
ridiculous outcome. I can give 
but ont; reason lor the huge fiasco 
which happened over the election 
for qaeen—lhe lack of communi- 
cation between the former queen 
contest chairman iiid in^i::?/ tu' 
between myself and the students 
of the sponsoring organizations 
I might suggest thai in the future 
election of any nature that all 
organizations should be requested 
to appoint someone to the elec- 
tions board and that all elections 
be run by Student Government. 

Again my sincere apologies 
to all those involved.

COMMUNICATOR REVEALED 



/ 



Recently discovered secret documents 
reveal that "The COMMUNICATOR" has been 
a satire paper for the entire year. How- 
ever, since it seems to have been a little 
too subtle for you people, we decided to 
make it obvious. 

SECRETARY NEEDED 

The Office of Student Services is taking 
applications for additional secretaries. Applicani 
should be single, pretty, slow typists, talkative 
and must, by ail means, like coffee. 

Prospective secretaries should feel free 
to drop in any time the office is open, though 
preferably when Mr. Bolinger is in (I0:50-M:00A M. 
or 2: 50-5:00 P.M. ). 

ATTENTION STUDENTS: LIBRARY TO BE CLnsZD 

The library will be closed during final 
week. It will reopen when vacation begins. 
IS THE COMMUNICATOR BEING CENSORED ? 

Maurice Emery, a functionally literate 
Purdue studtnt and a member of the P^jblication 
Board, has been accused of censorship of the 
COMMUNICATOR. When asked, Maurice rep I led, 

"The COMMUNICATOR can print whatever 

1 1 we II pi eases . "

should contact Dan Motto and he will cure you.

A Refrui tat ion of Darwin 

Due to ignorance perpetuated by todciy's 
so-called scientist, most people have 
swallowed the monkey-to-mar theory. This 
unfortunate circumstance has arisen because 
of the stupidity of a certain Charlie Darwin. 
All the wise old men of his day knew that man 
descended from the peach. However, Charlie 
didn't understand this so one day the wise 
old men took him out to a peach orchard. 
One wise old man pointed to a peachtree 
and told Charlie, "From whence hath man 
come." Charlie, not being very bright, 
thought the wise old man was referring to 
the monkey which happened to be swinging 
through the peachtree, rather than the 
peachtree itself. Darwin put his utterly 
absurd theory down in a book and this myth 
has I i ved to this day ! 

Actually, though the truth has been 
suonrocised. it Is really quite apparent 
to observant people that the peach theory 
is factual. Any serious stucent of television 
commercials has obiously realized that only 
two things in the entire universe shave with 
a razor — man and the peach.. 

Even our beginnings are amazingly similar, 
's it mere coincidence that we're born in 
a hospital? Even our forefathers, the 
fathers of our country, realized our peachy 
background. In the Constitution, if the 
President, the head of our land (or orchard 
if you prefer), does a poor job, what do 
we do? Why, we impeach himl Ben Franklin, 
the archetype of a true American, made an 
obvious reference to our heredity, when he 
spoke of the pitfalls of a divided country. 
He so cleverly, "Either we hang together 
or we shall all hang separately," 

Our language Is full of subtle references. 
There is everything from a peach of a girl 

pitiful situation. Life is really 
peaches and cream. Hopefully 
hasn't spoiled it for you, '

No funds have been allocated to the Slack 
Student Union. 

In accordance with policies adopted by the 
Purdue Board of TruBtees January 20, 1971, and 
made available to the Students' Government on 
March 16, 1971, J2,800 has bean allocated for a 
black history week. This allocation qualifies 
under Section 1, B,I, Campus Wide Activities, as 
"a cultural program which contributes to a well- 
rounded student 1 i fe. " 

Discussion of a possible ail oc at Ion of stu- 
dent activity funds to the Black Student Union 
began prior to the beginning of the second 
semester. The issue is one that has come up 
not as a result of the Human Relations Com- 
mission position (which was not announced until 
mid-April). The issue was b nought up as a re suit 
of the 8oa rd of Trustees' policies which do not 
permit the allocation of funds directly to the 
Black Student Union but do permit the funding of 
cultural activities. Consultation with Dean 
and DI rector Roger Manges regarding the fund- 
ing of a black history week revealed that such 
an activity is a legitimate expenditure of stu- 
dent activity money. 

In his editorial, John never stated that he 
opposed a black history week. 1 should conclude 
that John was merely Interested in the truth as 
this is the first time that money has been ap- 
propriated speci f Icai l.y for a cultural program. 
But since John never auestloneri mn ahnut +Ko 
matter, 1 must conclude that John wanted, rather, 
to publicly avenge his distasteful defeat at the 
polls. It Is rather shoddy vengeance. 

John's concern with "What the hell gives??" 
and his concern with facts only renews my faith 
in democracy. The voters knpw--don't they John? 

For Scott: I reiterate- What the hell gives? 

Above Is Mr. GMIje's purported reply to 
my editorial of "May 7. However, Mr. Gillie 
has lot obviously, answered question tt I of 
the editorial. What he has p resented is merely 
a r, it-picking and misleading review of my points 
of understanding and th rown In a personal attack 
of slander to cloud the fact that he has not 
answered the question. 

I am pleased to observe that Mr. Gillie has 
con f I rmed the first two articles of my "Assump- 
tions" (Which I never claimed to be assumptions, 
but merely said to be statements that 1 had heard! 
His comment on the third Is partially correct. 
He states that there was no letter mentioning 
him In the News -Sen ti ne I . Correct. 1 1 was , In 
actuality an' article reporting remarks of Mr. 
Fulmore in the April 24 Issue of the Journal- 
Gazette. In this I stand corrected. However, 
since the article said the same thing as what i 
thought was contained In a letter that 1 had 
or i gl na 11 yspoken of, the third statement of my 
editorial still seems to be valid. On his commeni 
about the fourth statement, Mr. GMlIe says 
It is f a I se : I have every reason to be 1 I eve It 
is true. Mr. Gillie would certainly not wish 
to be branded as a "Racist" if he we re seeking 
a seat on the Mayor's Human Relations Commi ss ion . 
And he certainly had the power to get quick 
action on the S2800 In order to vlewed'as a 
champion of the M I nor 1 1 1 es 'rl ghts . Mr. Gillie's 
response to the fifth statement says that it 
is " a clever but mistaken point." I fall to 
see how It could be mistaken. Mr, Gillie 
certa Inly does notenlightenus. 

Mr. Gillie states that no funds had been 
allocated to the Black Student Union. On this, 
I agree. in fact, I be 1 ieve 1 made that evident 
in my first paragraph by stating that the BSU was 
getting "control" over the S2800. 

Mr. Gillie th rows out a red-herring by stating 
that his seeking of the commission position was 
made public after the BSU first attempted ^° 96'*' 
money. This merely emphasizes the point that It's 
suspicious that BSU's victory camebO quickly, 

after months of inaction, following Mr. Gillie's 
announcement and Mr. Fulmore's attack. 



f-AGE 9 
Mr, billleimplies that the only reason that 
1 brought these issues forth, is that I am 
bitter about my defeat In the recent election. 
Come now, Scott, surely you can do better than 
that!- First, the issues concerning the $2800 
have nothing to do w i &lt; n my late campaign. Next, 
even If they did, I would still raise my question- 
Last, I cons i der it p resumptuous of you to assume 
that my defeat at the polls was d! &lt;?tastef u I . 
On the contrary, 1 was rather pleased at the 
result.- For one thing, 1 got the support of 
[roughly one-third of the students (in a much vast, 
turnout than your electiom got): there only 
berng a thirty-eight vote margin between me and 
Mr. Franke, who led in voting in the general 
election. 1 also fail to see how you can 
connect any fane i ed ■ revenge toward yourself 
from me with any facet of the recent elections. 

In conclusion, it seems to me that Mr. Gillie'' 
entire letter of rebuttal amounts to zero. He 
has not conclusively refuted any major ports of 
my editorial, since his letter contains only 
attacks at petty details and slander directed 
at me. Nor does he ever seem to get around to 
answering the question directed toward him in 
my editorial, that is: has he been taking the 
students for a ride in order to succeed at his 
own personal political and economic goals? So 
again I find myself asking that as ye f unanswered 
question: "What the Hell GIvesV^j^HN H, SIMERMAN

While It Is true that everyone is entitled to 
their own opinion, why some people bother to 
express their opinion (Mr. Simerman) without 
establishing the facts is beyond my comprehen- 



Eugene Fu I more 



.S.U, President 



"s/iort n' simple^ Answered 

I am much gratified that Mr. Fulmore has 
acknowledged my right to hold opinions, I 
might, moreover, inform Mr. Fulmore that I 
always try to get the facts before I form 
an opinion. He would undoubted 1 y ag ree that 
sometimes rumors and private confidences are 
difficult to corroborate and the best method 
of determining the actual situation in many 
instances is to publicly state how the 
situation appears and to invite the persons 
involved to make a direct and to-the-point 
statement of clarification. Regarding my 
editorial, it seems that Mr. Fulmore does not 
wish to make (or possibly cannot make?) any 
statement of fact to enlighten the student 
body. From this lack, 1 am forced to draw 
my own conclusions about Mr. Fulmore. I 
might add that, from reports made to me by 
various members of the Student Government 
regarding verbal attacks on them by Mr- Fulmore, 
my conclusions are strengthened.

Little 500 

Alpha Taa Omega crossed tht 
finish line in the record-breaking 
time of 2:12.19 to win the 21sl an- 
naal Liltle 500 Bike Race at Bloom- 
inglon lust Saturday. 

A crowd of over 21.000 looked 
on as Carlo Logan, Kevin Fiske, 
Frank Waller, and Mark Brandon ped- 
dled A'rO home in fronl of 32 other 
contenders. 

Acncia passed 1'heta Chi and 
Phi Cnmma Delta in the last quarter 
lap to claim second place as the. 
latter two teams collided for an in- 
slant then regained control to finish 
third and fourth' respectively. All of 
the tup four teams broke the previous 
initk record set by Phi Kappa Psi 
in 196B ivith a time of 2:12.51. 

Throughout the first half of the 
race, the leud conNtantly changed 
hands as the fronl ranning teams 
varied their peddlers and followed- 
Iheir planned strategy for the nee. 
Five learns all had identical times 
as they crossed the starting line tor 
Ihe 90th lime: Acacia, Oodd'e 
House. Phi Delta Thetu, ATO, nnd 
Sigma Nu. 

\t the 100 liip nmrk the top fi 
teams, within two seconds of each 
other, had on average time of 22.69 
m.p.h. Last year's half-way average 
was only 22-21 m.p.h. The beautiful 

and the skill of the drivers all' 
added to the explosive speed of ' 
the race. 

Afler UO laps had been eom- 
plcled. [he tup six trunis were all 
within one second a» Phi Delta 
Thclu leading the- way. The sitth 
and seventh teams were seiianiled'

Twenty laps later. Phi Comma 
Delta, Acacia, and Thetu Chi began 
to break away from the test of ihe 
field, but at 170 laps ATO had re- 
g[iiaed the lead. 

With only ten laps to go, six 
teams were slill very much in the 
running: Theta Chi, Alphn Tuu 
Omega. Acacia, Phi Gumma Delta, 
Kappa Sigma, and Sigma Nu. 

The people's favorite in ihe 
race had to be either Phi Delta 
Theta or Theta Chi as they bugan

lions but-finished sixth and third, 
respectively. Phi Delta TheU even 
led the race for awhile, which was 
first time officials had remembered 
a team moving up from 33t&gt;l' lof the 
top spot. 

In spite of the record-breaking 
speeds of the earnest, there were 
only three actual accidents. Phi

lided in the 'second stiarghtaway 
after approximately 70 bps- In one 
of the earlier accidents, Briscoe, B.

If you haven't heard yet, anc 
you probably haven't, the Harbar- 
arbar Days Queen Contest has been 
declared invalid. 

Ttie actual results showed 
liaak Walton's tulip tree placing 
second, but the decision was made 
by Jim Bolinger and Joanne Lantz 
to throw out the tree's votes as 
well as Jim Defranzo's. 

The decision to eliminate Oe- 
Fronio and the tree was made 
after re-reading an April 1 5th 
memo from the Board of Trustees 
stating that only activity-card- 
paying students can receive 
prizes. This excuse is extremely 
weak, for the prizes generally 
go to the sponsoring organizations. 
It is interesting to note that 
the date of the memo and the fact 
that the decision was made after 
the votes had been counted. Why 
were Defronzo and the tulip tree 
left on the ballot, when they were 
supposedly Ineligible? Also, why 
were the ballots destroyed after 
Izaak Walton asked for a recount? 
After rehashing these and 
other questions between Mr. Bol- 
linger, Dean Lantz, Mike Herron, 
Izaak Walton, and the Independent 
Student's Union, the fraud was un- 
covered and a lenethy discussion 



resulted in the entire contest being 
declared invalid. 

This Is only the surface of 
the question, however. ISU and 
Izaak Walton were using this con- 
test to protest. They wanted their 
representation to be heard, and 
they worked through legislatively 
correct channels to voice it. Then 
along came the administration... 
After leading ISU and Izaak Walton 
into believing that their protest 
would be heard, the administration 
reversed its position, and declared 
Defronzo and the tulip tree i„gl. 
gible. 

A second place finish in the 
queen contest shows that a largo 
proportion of students backed the 
protest. The casual ignoring of 
these votes clearly shows Ihe ad- 
ministration's stand: student re- 
presentation by only those stu- 
dents whom the administration 
(eels should be represented. 
To put It bluntly, a lot of students 
here are getting screwed! 

Admittance of fraud by the ad- 
ministration solves nothing. The 
protest is still not being heard. 
Maybe next time the protest won't 
bs quite so peaceful...

Of all high school graduates

out. This average 'moriality' rale 
tvas found in Q Princeton Univer- 
sity study completed in 1965- From 
school to school, the drop-out rale 
varies from 12% to 82^. Purl of 
this high drop-oul rale can be uis 
counted for by the fuel that many' 
slate. universities must, by \aa, ac- 
cept all applicants. However, the 
University of California accepts 
only the lop \5% of high school 
graduates and it's drop out rule is 
45^. With this in mind, Princeton 
questioned every drop-oat from 



Further statistics of interest 
lo college students are on I.Q. 
Studies have shown that the aver- 
age high school gmduate has an

I'hcy found that poor motivation and 
immulurily consistantly contributed 
lo sludcnls withdrawing from higher 
education. \ny university student 
considering, dropping out this year 
may be hastened by the fact that 
the Princeton study found that 97% 
It! iheir drop-ouls returned lo col- 
lege and S5% of them did obtain a 
degree. It was found that the main 
reason for reluming to school v&gt;as

tion—for ihe drop-out, the 
sludcnl, and the graduate—is a 
life-long process. Heartening to 
older students still working toward 
degrees is the fact thai only US 
of graduate atudent:^ are under the 
oge of 23 and 45% are over the age 
of 29.
