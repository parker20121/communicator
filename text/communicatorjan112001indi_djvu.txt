RAD was created in 1989 by retired 
police officer, Larry Lawrence Nadeau 
Lawrence took seir-defcnsc la 
officers and modified them lo 
of women Today the program is presented 
in approximately 400 colleges and universi- 
ties the United States and Canada. 

Amy Wilson and Jeff Davis, certified 
RAD instructors, introduced the program lo 
IPFW last July. It ,s a pari of Police and 
Safely IPFW's program is modeled after ihe 
one .n Purdue and it receives its funding 



_ ) Davis, Ihc free classes are 
offered lo women only. "We don't want to 
teach rapists our techniques." said Davis. 
People taking the classes musi be IPFW slu- 
dcnls. faculty or staff. Relatives and spouses 
of faculty, slaffand students v '

sludent is provided wilh a reference manual

four three-hour sessions. The main focus of 
Ihe class is self-defense awareness and 
recognition of surroundings. 

"Risk reduction is the mosi important 
faclor. The best crime is the crime that 
you're nol in. One in three women are sexu- 
ally attacked during the course of their life- 
times. Men are hardly ever attacked." said 
Davis. "We stress empowerment of women." 

Davis and Wilson said women become 
empowered when their intuition is enhanced 
They gain a self- realization of the power 



ulalion. The classes are very confiden 
For example, one class was being held in a 
racquclball court. The instructors fell that.the 
class was visible to loo many people and was 
moved lo another location. They usually 
cover the windows and any other area in 
which someone could view ihe techniques. 

Instructors are required to go thru ugh 
30 hours of training and pass both a written 
and a technique test, [f a male instructor is 
not o pan of law enforcement, he will have 
lo go through a background investigation. 
Instructors must also be women's advocates. 
For example, one man also works at a sexu- 



Davis and Wilson sa.d lhal IPFW's sta- 
lislics are good. There has been one reported 
rape since 1982. Seven sex-related crimes 
have been reported within the last 10 years. 

The nest RAD classes will be offered 
on Feb S, 7, 12 and 14 from I to 4 p.m.. 
March 5-9 from noon to 2:30 p.m. and April 
7. 14, 21 and 28 from 9 a.m. lo noon. The 
last class is a simulation, which is optional. 

"We wanl to work around the students' 
schedules. We would like to reach out lo os 
many people as possible. If a sorority, 
women's athletic team or a department, for 
example, would like lo lake classes, we arc 
willing to leach them."' said Davis,

LAROUCHE CALLS FOR 
EMERGENCY CREDITS AND 
RE-REGULATION TO DEAL 
WITH ONGOING FINANCIAL 
BREAKDOWN CRISIS 

WASHINGTON. DC, Jan. S (EIRNS)- 
Responding during his Jan. 3 webcasl lo ques- 
tions about Ihe significance ol Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan's reduction ol mleresl 
rales, newly announced Democratic Presidential 
candidate Lyndon LaRouche presented two 
emergency proposals. 

Dismissing Greenspan's approach as incom- 
petent and leading lo further hyperinflation. 



LaRouche said thai President Clinton should 
immediately lake two measures: First, he should 
use Presidential powers lo creale an emergency 
fund ol credit which would be directed into 
urgently needed, major employment projects, like 
construction ol power planls in California. 
Second, he should immediately re- regulate those 
sections of the economy, particularly Ihe energy 
utilities, In order lo prevent a power emergency. 

LaRouche put il this way: There's only 
one ihing you can do. The system is going lo 
blow. What do you do? You don't use monetarist 
m el hods. Monetarist methods caused the prob- 
lem. Yes. you may use credit. You did what 
Roosevelt did wiih Jesse Jones and the 
Reconstruction Finance Corporation: that's what

Originally, ihe area in which the tracks were found 
was thought to be underwater uurmp this time period. 
Kvale said. "Our findings indicate the area was exposed 
to (he air. Il was a tidal flat." 

The tracks also suggest thai 
Ihe dinosaurs who left them may 
have been swimmers. Kvale said 
thai along with Ihe tracks, parallel 
scratch marks on some of the rock 
surfaces hive also been found. 

These marks, he said, "look

IPFW professor of geo- 
sciences James Fallow, an expert 
on dinosaur tracks whom Kvale 
consulted us part of his research on 
ihe new site, said (hat some of Ihe 
dinosaurs may have been as long 
as 20 feet from nose to tail. 

The tracks themselves range 
from (wo to 23 inches in length 
and show that the animals had 
bird-like, three-ioed feel, 

Kvale and his colleagues 
recently presented their findings at 
the Geological Society of America 
convention in Reno on Nov. lb. 

In Ihe Bighorn Basin Kvale 
said that tens of thousands of sim-

RU-486 continues to be cheap, effective 



.11 lruli irmiugh- 
oul 1994 and 1995, the Food and Drug 
Administration recommended approval of 
RU-486 in the summer of 1996. The FDA 
found that RU-486. which is also called 
mifepristone, is both safe and effective. 

Mifepristone has been legal for use in 
the United Slates since 1953. Early on. it 
was used to treat numerous ailments includ- 



r,. il the. 



reported that RU-466 has been legally sold 
for abortion purposes in France for the past 

How It Works 

Suppose that you recenily found out 
that you were pregnant and decided to ter- 
minate ihe pregnancy using mifepristone 

First, you cannot be more than seven 
weeks pregnant. IT this is (rue. the nest thing 
(hat you need to do is contact your health- 
care prouder. During the nenl two weeks 
you will visil your doctor about three times. 

At the first visit, you will read a med- 
ication guide and sign an agreement that 
shows you have made Ihe decision lo termi- 
nate your pregnancy and that you under- 
stand Ihe risks involved. After a physical 



eiam, you will be given three tablets of 
mifepristone. You will lake one of these 
pills daily for (he next three days. Then you 
will see your doctor again. If you are still 
pregnant al this lime, you will take two 
more pills of a drug known as misoprostol. 

and cupel the embryo After about two

The perceived benefits of Ihe abortion 
pill are lhat 11 is safe, effective, relatively 
ineipcnsivc. non-invasive and avoids Ihe 
need for surgery and anesthesia in mosl 
cases. Some women feel lha( it is also a

Side Effects 

You're probably wondering about the 
possible drawbacks According to the mak- 
ers of RU-486, if ihe pregoancy was nol ler- 
minated after taking both pills, which hap- 
pens about eight percenl of the lime, (he 
baby could have birth defects if Ihe preg-

"Cast Away" Stars Tom Hanks 
and Helen Hunt. It was directed by 
Robert Zemeckis. The movie follows 
the survival of Hanks, a FedEx

his advantage One package, which 
has a drawing of wings on it he 
decides not to open. 

Hanks sort of befriends ihc 
volleyball Wilson. His pseudo-rela- 
tionship with the ball allows for 
Hanks to have something to say 
instead of just acting.

Tom Hanks— the Robin Crusoe He 
is tanned, thin, muscular, bearded 
and keeps an unruly mane of graying hair, and wears a 
tiny loin cloth He is almost emaciated and some- 
thing—someone other than Ihc man in the beginning of 
the movie. 

He is part wild now after spending Tour years in 
isolation and living off what he can catch or gather 
with his own hands Hanks still speaks to his 
volleyball Wilson They're now old friends. 

Then one day one half of a poriajohn washes 
ashore Hanks waits lu the sound of its dim thrashing 
against some rocks in Ihc shallows He stands it right 
side up and watches it fur a moment unable to think

made an attempt at escaping the island on his life raft 
Once he got out past the breakers surrounding Ihc 
island, the huge waves capsized his boat and spit him 
back to shore. Along the way he wi. dragged across

Hanks works to make rope and build a raft and 
eventually, well, you can guess what happens.

assists and two steals. Sophomore Brad Noll had 10 
points, four assists and four steals. Freshman starters Jim 
Kessenich and Lindsay Henderson added eight and six 
points, respectfully. 

Noll summed up his thoughts on the game by stating. 
*l think ne came out strong. We were aggressive, the team 
was ready to play, but we just couldn't finish at the end." 
Wise added. "I think we played hard for 40 minute*. 
We just couldn't get some stops down the stretch. They got 
to the free throw line and we just didn't make the plays 
down the stretch that we needed to make to win the game- 
However. Bella/mine did get to the line, shooting 17 
of 25 on the game. The Dons did not reach the line in the 
first half and shot eight of 13 in the second half. 

For the game, the Dons shot 42 percent, including 36

Looking toward future games, the GLVC should pro- 
vide a challenging task for the Dons. "It seems like each 
game, we do one thing belter than the game before, then 
we also have that letdown in some other area." said Noll 

It will be a challenge for the Dons to continue to do 
one thing belter each game and also put a stop to the let- 
downs that seem to be haunting them

The Dons started the game well and went into half-

Head Coach Karl Smesko said. "Offensively. I think 
we played fine and we scored plenty of points lo win. but 
we didn't get any slops. And give Bcllarmine credit, every 
open shot they got. they knocked down . . . they didn't 
miss, but they're good players, and if you give Ihem good 
looks at the basket, they're gonna make it, and we gave 
them way loo many looks for us to win." 

Defensively, however, the Dons did not play well. 



allowing Bethrminc to shoot 60 percent from the field in 
the second half and 10-12 from the three-point range for 
the game. 

Smesko said. "1 didn't think that our effort defen- 
sively was very good We really didn't do what we set oul 
to do defensively at all . .They played very, very well and 
they're a very good team." 

Looking ahead at the conference schedule. Smesko 
said. "It doesn't get any easier. Our conference is very 
lough and if you're not ready lo play defense and rebound. 
it's going in gel ugly in a hurry."

Involvement yields pride

cently I attended "College Night" 
Wayne Komct hockey game against the Missouri River 
Otters, As we drove through die tunnel into the parking 
lot. I was greatly anticipating the opportunity to see 
and hang out with manv of my friends from IPFW. I 
liguiL-d thai, lince I am a man of what I like toconsid- 
cr a "phoiographic memory." 1 would at least recognize 
some people from IPFW. 

As 1 purchased my ticket. I ran into an acquain- 
tance from Purdue West Lafavette I gave her a quick 
head nod and proceeded to purchase ,my ticket for the 
nominal fee of just S4. 

Walking into the arena. 1 was greeted with more 

at a KometS game this season Knowing that the aver- 
age college student is. shall we say. poorer than a 
mouse in a house. I was amazed dial more students do 
not take advantage of watching semi-pro hockey for 
half price. 

We walked around the arena to our scats and I 
looked around for any faces I would recognize from 
campus. I actually saw more people I knew liiim 
Purdue West Lafayette lhan I did from IPFW. 

After attending a pair of basketball games this 
past weekend on campus, where the eheerleading 



squad outnumbered ihc student section by 2-1. 1 began 
lo question why IPFW students don'l attend and sup- 
pon IPFW sporting events. 

When I visit Indiana University, I hear students 
talking about how they are going lo go lo all these 
games and they arccicited lo support their school in all 
spons. no matter the sport — and no mailer how good 
the team is in the sport
