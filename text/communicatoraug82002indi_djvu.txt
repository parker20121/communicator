A panel of experts d

year, and the statistic: likely will 
not increase by much since the 
mosquito season— and therefore 
the West Nile virus season- 
ends after the first hard frost, 
which is only six or eight weeks 
away in this part of the country. 
Of the seven reported 
cases in Indiana, none have 
resulted in death. This has not

saturated local and national

Even so, the West Nile virus 
is still a relatively insignificant 
threat to most people since only 
about one percent of those 
exposed to mosquitoes will con- 
tract the virus, and of that one 
percent, only about 10 percent of 
those infected will have serious 
complications. Small children 
and those over age 50 are most at 
risk for becoming seriously ill. 

Although it is recommend- 



ed that individuals do not han- 
dle any sick or dead birds found, 
no case has ever been reported ol 
anyone contracting West Nile 
from a bird, living or dead, or 
any other creature other than a 

The West Nile virus is a 
torm ol encephalitis, which caus- 
es swelling of the brain. 
Enchephalitis is the most preva- 
lent mosquito-borne disease in 
the Midwestern Uniled States. 

There are three other types 
of encephalitis which are com- 
mon in Indiana, one of which, St. 
Louis encephalitis, caused an 
epidemic in Indiana in the 1970s, 
after which Ihe incidence of the 
disease died down. 

There is no vaccine against 
or treatment for the virus Some 
symptoms of the virus can 
include, hut .ire nut limited lie 
high fever, contusion, malaise, 
vomiting, diarrhea and 
headache. 

Most who contract the dis- 
ease have no symptoms and 
develop some immunity to the 
virus. The only help for those 
infected who develop serious 
symptoms is lo try 1 to lower the 
resullhing fever and keep 
hyd rated. 



The primary reason for a 
person to be tested for the virus 
if he became ill is so that health 
monitoring agencies can track 
the virus and spray areas where 
the virus has infected people or 
animals. 

Targeted spraying and pre- 
ventative measures have been 
Ihe main weapons ol defense 
against West Nile, and there are 
step- that vnu can take to help 
protect yourself from Ihe virus.

Student housing initiative dormant again 

Dormless bridge construction to begin, despite financing difficulties 



IPFW's 

administration took a huge step 
in making ihe school a belter 
place for learning. 

Student housing was to be 
made available, pending the 
procurement ol linancial 
resources. Many students were 
enthusiastic about the fact that 
1PFW would soon be recognized 
as a complete university, rather 
than a commuter campus. 

The plan for student hous- 
ing 15 to have seven residential 
buildings and a pedestrian 
bridge to connect the school lo 
Ihe dorms. 

The buildings 






' corn 



other schools do — they are to 
contain apartments The cost ul 
each apartment will depend on 
the number of rooms The cost ol 
the whole initiative is projected 
to be S23-S24 million. 

Due to insufficient funds, 
the building project will not be 
executed as planned. Dorm con- 
struction was supposed to begin 
at Ihe beginning of this summer 
and be completed by fall 20O3. 
Currently, the project's comple- 
tion dale is set For fall 2004. 

Walt Branson, vice chancel- 
lor of financial aftairs. explained 



thai there are two main reasons 
for the financial problems thuj 
arc currently experiencing. 

First, IPFW has no track 
record because it has no dorms 
Most other schools have dorms, 
so if they needed financial 
resources, they would be for 
-i liool expansion. In Ihe case of 
IPFW, a brand new project is 
being started which is more 
expensive than simply expanding 

The other main reason for 
the difficulties in getting fund- 
ing is that there really is no way 
to firmly guarantee the project 
because of the high expense. 

According lo David 
Danielson of the Physical Plant, 
a non-profit organization was 
lormed in order to sell bonds for 
the financing of the project. 

IPFW's administration was 
sure that nothing would go 
wrung llus time, such as when 
Ihe IliS changed its lax laws. The 
non-profit organization thai was 
formed could no longer sell 
bonds due to the change ol laws 

Currently, the administra- 
tion is looking al oilier possible 
ivays lo finance Ihe project. 
These methods could include 
the use of a conventional mort- 

6 age, Ihe same way people 
nance homes. The money is 
borrowed from the bank, used to 
finance the project and then is 




because Ihe school secured fed- 
eral funds from the Transport 
Equity Act for pedestrian 

The federal aid is supposed 
lo cover 80 percent of the 
Finances for the bridge. In addi- 
tion to providing safe transport 
from the proposed dorms to the 
campus, one of the main purpos- 
es lor the bridge is to connect the 
RiverGreenway to the neighbor- 
hoods surrounding IPFW. 

1PFW authorities are deter- 
mined to produce student hous- 
ing for the students of IPFW and 
are quite certain that this could 
happen in the near future. 



Constuction of the pedesti

Another solution currently 
being considered by IPFW is 
starting the project on a slightly 
smaller basis.

Mike Downs Center works to preserve documents New music department chair sets goals for future 



Located in Helmke Library on 
the second floor, the Mike Downs 
Center for Indiana Politics func- 
tions lo collect and preserve politi- 
cal memorabilia For those who are 
doing historical research, others 
who want to reminisce and "politi- 
cal junkies who just love it, says 
Andrew Downs, director. "It has a 
broad appeal." Members of the 
community have called the center 
ollenng lo donate documents, but- 
tons and other memorabilia. 

Some of the memorabilia is on 
display in a case on the second Floor 
of the library. The disj

The display includes some of 
the more visual items such as fans, 
buttons and political cartoons. Each 
item has a story behind it, and those 
working in the center have attempt- 
ed lo put a brief description with 
those items. The oldest item in the 
display is a book on the history of 
Fort Wayne published in 1868. 

Some of the documents includ- 
ed in Ihe center contain consultant 
reports on the River Grecnway in 
Port Wayne as well as environmen- 
tal reports. The center is attempting 
to partner with Helmke Library lo 
make some of these documents 
more accessible to the public. The 
long-range goal is to incorporate 



the center's documents as part of 
the library's general collection. 

Another future goal for the 
center is to develop a permanent 
display site lor the memorabilia.

Those in the center are also 
working on a website that will 
house all of the articles on virtual 



and office holders' sites "This is an 
attempt to reduce the time cost of 
being an educated voter." Downs 
said. The goal is to have Ihe infor- 
mation available needed (or people 
to make an informed voting deci- 
sion. The yvebsite should be ready 
by mid -October. 



Robert D. Bean, recently appointed 
chair of the music department, had a brief 
interview with The Communicator just 
before the semester began. He moved here 
from Alabama where he ivas a professor 
and director of graduate studies in music at 
the University of Montevallo. While 
becoming familiar with the area, he's 
enjoyed Fort Wayne so far. 

When asked if there are any improve- 
ments or plans he would like to make with- 
in the music department. Bean said that he 
hoped lo "help the department refine its 
identity, and also to make Ihe bigger com- 



nityai

■e enrol 1m en I 



Currently, given the somewhat limited 
facilities tor classrooms and faculty, this 
mission is being watched carefully. The 
department is. however, making plans for a 
new Performing Arts Center, which Bean 
believes will help the department's growth 
tremendously. 

Establishing better relations with high 
schools in the Fort Wayne area lo get kids 
interested in the music department's pro- 
grams is also something that Bean is look- 
ing into The department already has a lev. 
Krograms in place including the Tri-Slate 
onors Band and The Choral Invitation. 
Kids are invited to participate in these 
events, which arc usually neekend affairs. 

Bean strongly believes that the IPFW 
music department has great potential and 
is excited and pleased to be here.

BOUND DOWN BY FOLLETT'S: 



Follett's not as overpriced for new 
books as students might think 



For days on end I've been trying to think of 
words adequate enough to describe my pure frus- 
trations with textbook buying. All students arc in 
the same boat in the respect that we need the 
books, but we don't want to nay the over-inflated 
publisher's price. Instead of bottling up my frus- 
trations and saving it for the First day of class, I 
decided lo do a little research on saving money 
when buying textbooks. 

I searched far and wide using one book. 
"Music Fundamentals lor Elementary Teachers 
3rd Edition,? as my example. After battling the 
throngs of students in Follett's, hunting down the 
MUS section in their newly redesigned bookstore 
which I am led lo believe just pumps the smell of 
money through their ventilation syslem, I found 
that 1 would oe spending $9150 on a brand new 
highlighter and coffee stain-tree book. For some 
odd reason (maybe it was the sight of dollar signs 
floating out of my purse), I went on a rampage 
back lo my office for a little planning. I decided 1 
would first ga to The Bookmark and check their 
prices. I walked in to find this little shop packed 
with college students just waiting to save money. 
1 waited about a half an hour, but it was worth it. 
1 found a used copy ol my textbook for S51. 

Feeling like an exceptionally good shopper, I 
relumed to my office, 540.50 richer. Upon return- 
ing, I sat down at my computer, cracked open a 
Mountain Dew (which I didn't buy on campus) 
and began searching the Internet. 

I remembered a letter lo the editor last 
semester that urged students lo check 
amazon.com for their books. Needless lo say, I 
almost spewed my precious Mountain Dew all 
over the screen when 1 saw I could have bought a 
used copy for S15. The condition of the book was 
not given, but it's not like 1 would have been out 
of that much money. I would have been willing to 
staple the pages together for SI5. 

The onebig drawback was, for the used copy, 
it would have taken 4-6 weeks lor delivery. As for 



a new book, at most, it would have been 
590, which is still Sl-50 less than Follett's. 
(Just enough lo drive to the store and buy a 
Mountain Dew.) 

I also decided lo look at Barnes and 
Noble's webpage and found that they loo 
are cheaper lhan Follett's and The 
Bookmark, but once again I would have to 
worry about having the books shipped on 
time. For next day delivery, the fee would 
be about S3, which in turn made the used 
book S7050. 

Confused? Yeah, me loo. So, here is 
the skinny. Amazon.com is the place to buy 
used textbooks. As for buying new books, 
it isn't going to make a difference where 
you buy them. Amazon.com or bamesand- 
noble.com aren't necessarily going to be 
cheaper lhan Follett's or The Bookmark 
because all bookstores charge list price 
(retail price). The only way the price of a 
new textbook is Iruly going to differ is in 
shipping fees. Allow me lo clarify: 

Amaion.com, new textbook: S82.24 
with NO shipping fees because the total is 
greater than S49. 

Follett's, new textbook S9150 

Bamesandnoble.com, new textbook: 
S90 * 52.99 shipping (ce= S92.99 

By now you're probably wondering 
when this is going lo become an editorial! 
well, here it is right now. I don't want to 
hear students bitchin' and moanin' about 
how much they spent on books the first 
day of class. 

I don't want to hear people complain- 
ing about what a rip-off Follett's is because 
there are other options, fust because the 
bookstore is located on campus doesn't 
mean that you are bound to buying your 
books there. Complaining isn't going to gel 
Follett's to lower their prices: it's a simple 
example of supply and demand. Look at gas 
lions. When one station's prices go up and 
other on the opposite comer stays down, it cai

Student body president welcomes students 



Fellow Students, 

I welcome you back lo 
yet another year here at IPFW. 
I understand that this past 
Monday marked the start of a 
very hectic schedule for us all. 
Many of you combine class 
time with work, family 
responsibilities and personal 
time. With this in mind, I still 
urge you lo do one thing — get 
involved. 

College is more than a 
learning endeavor: it is intend- 
ed to be an experience. There 
many ways you 



There are over 75 student 
organizations on campus that 
any student can join. If for some 
reason there isn'l a group that 
matches what you're looking 
for, then start one— it's that 
easy. Information on joining or 
starting a club can be found in 
the ever-helpful Office of 
Student Life located in Walb 115. 

Sludent Government is 
another great avenue for get- 
ting involved and making a 
difference. The Sludent Senate 
has many vacant scats, and the 
Sludent Activities Board is 



also looking lor enthusiastic 
students for Ihe unlimited 
board seats. Picking up a form 
at Walb 225 can start Ihe brief 
application process. 

If you don't have the time 
for these organization-, that 

other opportunities. 

As Student Government 
president, il is my |ob lo 
appoint students to both uni- 
versity and chancellor com- 
mittees. These committees can 
range from having monthly to 
bi-ycarly meetings, so Iney 
take up less time, betler 
accommodating the busier 
student. 

The benefits lo being 
appointed to such committees 
are threefold. First, you can 
gain a be Her understanding of 
Row Ihe universily works and 
voice your opinion represent- 
ing your fellow students in a 

Second, if s a great way to 
network and interact with 
influential faculty in a non- 
classroom environment. 

Lastly, being more than 
the average college student 
certainly looks good on your 
resume after you graduate. 



miltees available, please slop by 
my olfice or leave a message lo 
set up an appointment. 

I hope that you heed 
Mime of my advice and look at 
other ways lo broaden your 
nor i ions and get involved 
during the brief years you 
spend here at IPFW. 

1 encourage any student 
who has questions or concerns 
to stop by my office or call me 
with any problem. If 1 don'l 
know Ihe answer to your 
question, I will direct you lo 
someone who does. 

Once again, I urge you to 
remember that college is what 
you make of it. I wish you all 
Ihe best of luck this academic

Ihc red, white and blue soda

Instead oi the calming 
hum of the Pepsi machine, the 
campus is left with the disturb-

machine, attempting to intimi- 
date each passerby into pur- 
chasing its cans and bottles of 
Vanilla Coke. 

Gone is the Mountain 
Dew, the drink of choice for 
many college students. 
Consider this scenario: 



I rips through the washing 
machine. 

Five attempts later, the 
machine accepts the paper like- 
ness of oar nation's first presi- 
dent. You glance up lo select 
the bright green button and— 
nothing. Jaw dropping to the 
floor, your eyes snap open. 
Somewhere in the background, 
you hear "Taps" playing.

chute of the soda machine.

Okay, so maybe that's a

college students arc chronically 
in need ol caflcine. It's pretty

two, jobs, be signed up for any.

and be involved in a variety of

Complaining 



Anyone who says I m 
bored,'' and cant even think ol 
just one interesting thing to do is 

I've lived in Fort Wayne for 
about three years and when I 
went to Snider High School, one 
of the things 1 constantly heard 
was thai there is nothing lo do in 
Fori Wayne. 

Now 1 know that Fori 
Wayne is not as interesting as 
New York or as exotic as Los 
Angeles, and it seems like it's a 
bil geared toward the church 
folk, but that doesn't mean there 
isn't anything to do. As a matter 
ol fact, there 5 plenty to do— you 
just need to know where to look. 

Here is an obvious resource 
that people often overlook: the 
phonebook. Believe it or not, if s 
probably going to be Ihc hi^iie-jt 
asset you'll have in your life. 

Inside this white- and yel- 
low-paged book, you can find 
just about anything in Fort 
Wayne that's legit. All ol Ihe 
diversions listed in this article 
can be located in the yellow 
pages. 

If you're looking for a 

Sood time with your friends, 
ten head over to places like 
Putt-Putt Golf &amp; Games, 
Tokens 'N Tickets, Lazer X, 
Ultrazone or the Fort Wayne 
Speedway. 

Tokens 'N Tickets is fun 
even though it is targeted a bit 
more toward younger chil- 
dren. Lazer X, Ultrazone and 
the Fort Wayne Speed wav 
, may be a bit pricey, but its 
good to go to those places 
every once in a while. 

Not interested in that sort 
of thing? Then try going to a 
bowling alley or a billiard park 
Many of these facilities permit 
smoking il that factors into your 
decision making. 

Perhaps one of the trendy cof- 
fee shops that seem to pop up 
everywhere Is the place you want 
to be. Many ol these establishments 
frequently feature artists or groups 
who provide entertainment for 
patrons as they sip then Ivvt'r.igi-s 
How about a comic book 
store for the immature male. (I 
frequently visit and have nothing 
lo be ashamed of) However, it 
you want to impress a date with 
your pseudo-maturity, then I 
suggest you go visit a museum or 
the BolanicalCardens . 

If sports arc your thing, be 



sure to check out the in. my tol* 
courses in Fort Wayne Going to 
all ol them would lill up a lot of 

Don't neglect your creativi- 
ty and spontaneity. Every now 
and then, just think of something 
unique to do and go do it. For 
example. I once had an idea to 
make a gasoline fume-powered 
ballistic cannon and received 
help from a bunch ol friends lo 
mate it out of PVC piping. When 
it was linished, it was capable of 
launching tennis balls 

If none ol these things inter- 
est you then maybe you should 
iu-.t Li.sthyr a bunch of friends at 
\nur place and have a good rent- 
ed video and a pizza ready. 

If you really need sugar on 
top, you could also just make a 
trip to a tattoo parlor (in an 
altered state ol mind, of course) 
where you'll have some mean- 
ingful phrase or artwork etched 
in your skin Later on. you can sit 
around wishing you'd found 
something else to do.

am a student of the visual arts program 
here at IPFW. I received my A.S. in com- 
I mercial art over the summer and am pursu- 
ing my B.S. When I'm not working, attending class or doing home- 
work, I like to read, draw, listen to music, be outdoors, hang out 
with family and friends or watch an occasional Nascar race on TV. 



Nick Altman, Sports Writer 

I'm a junior majoring in media and public communication with a 
minor in journalism. I was heavily involved in sports broadcasting 
on Huntington North High School's radio station, WVSH. I became 
involved in sports writing my senior year and began providing sto- 
ries for the Website, The Insiders Report. I've been a sports corre- 
spondent for The Herald-Press, Huntington county's only daily 
paper for two years. 



Penny Tsiguloff, Columnist 

I began writing From the Left late last year. I have a variety of interests such 
as health, yoga, running, art and humanities. I guess that diversity is reflected 
in ray choice of majors and minors. 

I will graduate in the spring, finally. As a non-traditional student, I 
have been in school a long time. I am investigating graduate 
schookand am a general studies major, with minors in ere- ' • 
ative writing, psychology and fine art, with a concentration in, 
ceramics. So, I guess when I graduate I wilt be qualified to 
write about psychological imp'act art, particularly pottery or 
society. Or maybe the creative nature of psyche. Anyway, I'd 
tike to gain a master's in art. I guess I would be lost without 
school. Maybe when I finally get my master's I can teach. 




Jenny Huntley, Reporter 

I am a women's studies major with minors in 
sociology and professional writing and am 
getting the Peace and Conflict Studies 
Certificate. I am active in the Honors 
Program. I have two children and enjoy read- 
ing, crafts and theater. 




Dan Vance, Sports Writer 

I am a freshman at IPFW. I enjoy all 
sports, but basketball is my favorite. I 
am a graduate of North Side High 
School. I was the sports editor of the 
yearbook for two years, in which I 
won a few awards for sports writing. I 
am into all kinds of music, but I really 
like indie rock and emo. I have yet to declare a major 
because I am transferring after my freshman year, but I 
will be majoring in journalism. 




Chichi Aneke, Staff Writer 

My full name is a mouthful and I'm yet to meet anyone who can pro 
nounce it properly excluding my family, so I just tell 
people to stick with Chichi. I'm an EE major. This will 
be my second year in college, but my academic standing 
is freshman. I can't wait to get done with school . I love 
traveling, meeting new people, shopping (if only I'm 
not forever broke), Internet surfing and talking for ages 
on the phone with my friends and poetry. That's me :)

The summer has been full 
of changes for Ihe music com- 
munity. The rap-metal that once 
dominated Ihe airwaves has 
now been replaced by classic 
rock influenced sounds from the 
likes of Ihe Hives and the 
Strokes. However, in the case of 
the Original Sinners, it seems 
that lead vocalist Exene 
Cervenka may have undergone 
Ihe mosl changes that may ulti- 
mately affect the sounds that 
more popular bands will adapl. 

And, it is not unusual for 
bands with Cervenka lo be influ- 
ential. Cervenka began her 
career in Ihe Los Angeles-based 
punk band X. The male-female 
duo vocals in thai band proved 
lhat harmonization wrthin Ihe, 
punk genre could be attained. 

During her lime with X, she 
was included in Ihe Knitters, a 



spin-off band that incorporated 
inlluenies Irom country and 
American roots music. 

Now Cervenka, a little 
older and a little more somber, is 
singing lead vocals for the 
Original Sinners, a punk ' 



Original Sinners strike a pose. From left to right Sam Soto, Kim Chi, Matt Young, 
Exene Cervenka, and Jason Edge. 

Original Sinners debut a sucess

When Cervenka is not 
singing about Ihe end of a rela- 
tionship or recovering from a 
night ol loo much partying, the 
resl of the band lakes over with 
wonderful instrumental. The 
surly Alligator Teelh" inspires 
almost all who listen to it to hit 
the waves. The country-rock 
sounding "Tick Tock" concludes 
the album. 

With the popularity of 
female- Iron led bands like Ihe 
Distillers, it should, not be hard 
lor the general public lo apprcci-

ference, though, in bands like 
Ihe Distillers and Ihe Original

influenced more lemale vocalists 
than can possibly be counted.

Why are Major Leaguers so greedy? 

'Enough is enough' as yet another strike threatens 



mpnsed ol some of base- 



ball bigger 



Depending on your 
perspective, the impending 
strike ol Major League 
Baseball could be a good 
thing or a bad thing. 

Whether goodor bad, 
everyone seems to be o! Ihe 
same mindset as far as Oicir 
dislike of the rapidly 
increasing greed of these 
athletes. Though it is not 
my favorite sport, I do 
enjoy flipping on an occj- 

Chicago Cubs game just for 
the enjoyment that I get 
from wa Idling these people

However, in today's

become more than enter- 
tainers — they have become 
role models and even 
heroes to today's youth. 

To some, bringing joy 
lo fans, whether they are 
old or young is enough; 
however, some professional 
athletes feel that more com- 

Sensation is due to them. 
hough the National 
Basketball Association has 
been locked out and other 
sports have had labor dis- 
putes, no athletes exhibit as 
much greed as MLB players. 
The last time that MLB 
went on strike in 1991, it 
ruined the sport's reputa- 
tion. It was years before 
they could actually get fans 
in die stands again. 

The interest in base- 
ball was at a steep decline 
from 1995-1997, If it wasn't 
for the homerun chase of 
1998, the interest would 
still be very low, not thai 
many teams can fill the 
seats anyway. The average 
attendance in 1995 was 20 
percent less than it was 
before Ihe '94 strike. 

The B&lt;™.d_ "&lt; &lt;he 
Players Association that is 



iy players what could 
have been their only shot at 
the big lime. 

Any success that MLB 
has had between 1991's 
strike and the impending 
strike is due to Mark 
McGwire and Sammy Sosa. 

As previously staled, I 
am not a huge baseball fan, 
but in the summer of 1998, 
McGwire and Sosa got me 
inlo il. I waiched ihe St. 
Louis Cardinals play on 
(our straight days lo see 
McGwire hit homeruns 59, 
60. 61 and 62. 

A strike now would 
only tear done whal 
McGwire and Sosa worked 
so hard to build in 1998. 
McGwire and Sosa were 
Ihe solution to 
MLB's problem. 

So why is il 
that nobody cares 
when Barry Bonds 
hil 73 or in his 
cjuest for 756? It's 
simple. Bonds is 
pari ol the problem. 

Barry Bonds 
is aboul as well

been playing MLB 
for 16 years and 
making quite a bit 



Association lead- 
ers to go ahead 
with a strike. 

The blame 
does not lie square- 
ly on the shoulders 
of Bonds. Another 
huge problem is 



senlatives is pushing for 
more money not only for 
veterans, but for anyone 
who make the All-Star 
learn. Seems to me like 
greed is kicking in. The last 
thing we need lo see is 
someone like Alex Rodriguez 
make more money. Very 
lew people will ever see 
5252 million in [heir life. 

Rodrigue? is simply 
handed that money for hit- 
ting a ball with a piece of 
wood. Granted, he is one of 
the best in a difficult sport, 
but should he be compen- 
sated more per year than 
the country's president? 

It's lime for the own- 
ers and Ihe fans lo stand up 
and say, "Enough isenough." 
Many of Ihe players have 
let fame go to their heads. 



Ihey 



They all play a role in : 
one's life; however, 
should not be compensated 
so greatly for their actions 
and their ability to entertain. 

This baseball strike 
would mark MLB's ninlh 
work stoppage since 1972. 
The best solution in my 
eyes is this; If the greedy 
athletes of baseball wanl to 
strike, let them slrike. In 
1994, replacement players 
were brought in to fill the 
spots. While less skilled 
than the regulars, replace- 
ment players provided 
entertainment and excite- 
ment to a dead sporl. 

But most importantly,

the help of a Hachaj save. IPFW 
stayed within a goal of Oakland. 



The Maslodons opened 
the second period on the offen- 
sive, taking three shots in the 
first 10 minutes. 

"[At halftime] Coach 
Slefankiewicz basically said 
don't feel the pressure and have 
fun with it," Hachaj said. "If 
you're not stressed, you play 
loose. Catch your breath and 
don't pul everything forward 
right away. He told Ihe fresh- 
men to follow the older guys. 
We had to step up, and we did-" 

Vande Vusse then found the 
back of the net during the 59th 
minute to be the score at 1-1. 

"Craig Vande Vusse start-

Stefankiewicz said. "He has 
asthma and had a breathing

much betler in the second half " 
Vande Vusse's goal came 
shortly af ler a heavy rain began 
to fall as play continued. 

"I don't think the rain

Stefankiewicz said. "I think 
they were so pumped and 
livu-t-J. finally focused, on the 
task at hand that I don't think they

"I love rain." said Hachaj,

Kristin McDonald scored the 
Dons' only goal. She paced the 
IPFW ollense with three shots, 
while Shannon Rinearson added 
one shot. 



"Meghan Doehla gives us a lot ol

We're very predictable." 

With the ball in Indiana's 
possession through much of the

defense.

player of the game. ' Stei.inkicwio- 
said She was just tremendous. 
Nobody beat her all night "

the board with the score at 4-1. 

After McDonald's goal, the 
Mastodons managed lo work Ihe 
ball lo Iheir end of the field, but 
none of their shots found the net. 

"After we scored the first 
goal, we had three or lour chances 
ourselves and we had Ihe ball 
down at our end, so that was 
encouraging," Slefankiewicz said. 
"I'm looting at what was positive 
and not what was negative."

Slefankiewicz remains optimistic 
about the Dons' season. 

"We had moments that I 
thought were very good," said 
Stefankiewicz. "We had about 
three or four chances at a goal, 
and we should've had three 
goals. We had a lot of voung-peo- 
ple mistakes, and we II see how 
they malure. I still believe in

What a difference a few years can make 



It's amazing what can come 
from a simple idea. 

Three years ago, IPFW soc- 
cer coach Terry Slelankicwic 
was watching college basket- 
ball's pre-season NIT on televi- 
sion, and a thought popped into 

1 called Indiana coach lerry 
Veaglev and said, 'It's time that 
soccer" had one of these,'" 
Stefankiewicz recalls. "Yeagley 
agreed and told me lhal we had 
Indiana. Then we gol South 
Carolina, Rutgers, Saint Louis 
and Duke, and they all came up 

The result was Ihe annual 
IPFW Soccer Showcase, which has 
become one of the biggest college 

"It's grown. It's the biggest 
fund-raiser on the soccer side, 
and it's put IPFW on Ihe map," 
Stclanl.icwicz said. "We're nation- 
ally known now. and any schivil 
thai comes wants to come back." 

How big has Ihe showcase 
become? Stefankiewicz was 
expecting as many as 10.000 peo- 
ple to attend some games. 

This year's field boasted 
five of the lop 25 teams in college 



soccer. The men's field includ- 
ed second-ranked Indiana, 
No. 13 Virginia and No. 23 
Kentucky, along with Michigan 
State and Oakland. 
The women's field featured sec- 
ond ranked North Carolina and 
No. 17 Notre Dame, as well as 
Indiana, Purdue and Kentucky. 

This is probably Ihe best 
field of 12 we've ever had," 
Slelankiewiczsaid. 

Accompanying two of Ihe 
learns will be two of NCAA soc- 
cer's winningest coaches. 

"There arc only two coaches 
in Ihe United States that have 
won more than 500 games, and 
we've goi both of them here ivilh 
Indiana's Jerry Veaglev and North 
Carolina's Anson Dorrance." 

This year IPFW dedicated 
the new 5800,000 Hefner 

Pavilion, which Slctankiewicz 

calls state-of-the-art. The new 

facility houses locker rooms, a 
concession stand, reslrooms and 
press boies at Ihe Hefner Soccer 
Fields Complex. 

Also new lo the showcase 
this year was Ihe Citadel 
Jamboree and Norlhrop High 
School Invitational. The jam- 
boree, hosted by Ihe Fort Wayne 
Citadel Soccer Club, attracted 
approvimately 50 14-year-old 



Also at the high school 
level, two of the state's top soccer 
teams clashed when Homestead 
and Canterbury met. 

Several of the college coach- 
es used the high school games as 
an opportunity to scout young 
talent from Ihe Fori Wayne area. 

"The high school games will 
be a great recruiting opportuni- 
Iv," Sielaiikiewicz said. "All the 
college coaches told me they're 
looking forward lo watching the 
Homestead and Canterbury 
game, and the Norlhrop kids 
play as well, so it's a really good 
opporlunilv tor the coaches. ' 

Although the IPFW squads 
did not take on the lop teams in 
Ihe showcase, Slefankiewicz 
does expect his teams to do so in 
the future, 

"We played Indiana two 

years ago, and they've lold US 
they'd plav us again, but we 
wanl to gel lo the point where 
we can really compele wilh 
them," Stefankiewicz said. 
"Somebody who came out and 
watched us practice recently 
said thai wiLh one more good 
recruiting class, we'll be there, 
and I believe thai. There are 
some really talented freshmen In 
this group."
