Chancellor meets 
with students 

Suite changes 
made in Walb 

I(y MICHELE R. SHAFFER 
Edilor-in-Chlet 

Over 100 students met with Chancellor Thomas Wallace on Sunday to discuss 
reallocation of the office space in Walb Memorial Union that is currently being 
used by student organizations on campus. 

The students in attendance were representative of Delta Gamma and Pi Beta 
Phi, the two social sororities on campus, Sigma Phi Epsilon, the social fraternity 
on campus, and Students' Government 

Wallace announced the university plans to move student organization office 
spiice from the southwest side of Walb Memorial Union's second floor to the nor- 
theast corner of the building's second floor. "What we're proposing for the student 
organization office space is Student Union, Room 210, A, B. C and D," Wallace 

Continuing Education, which currently occupies space in three locations in 
■Walb,oneofwhichisSuite210, would consolidate into space presently occupied by 
student organizations. 

This particular change also means that the Arts and Crafts room will be 
eliminated, Wallace said. 

Wallace told students they would begetting about a 12 percent increase in space 
"11 will improve the quality of space, and quantity," Wallace said. 

Other changes being considered for Walb are lo add more classrooms and to 
convert the music room to a computer room, "What we are attempting, which 1 
think we are doing, is to improve the effectiveness of the use of this building," 
Wallace said 

Wallace also announced plans lo convert the second floor lounge into a video- 
mediated classroom, with television hook-up. Such a change would allow IPFW to 
have more teleconferences and satellite-transmitted, televised courses. The 
change would also mean the second floor lounge would be closed in. eliminating the 
entire lounge area. 

Wallace said the changes would mean an increased traffic flow of students in 
Walb. "Our interest is to get more going on at this end of campus." he said. 
Wallace said any plans to move the bookstore to Walb have been tabled for right 
now. An eadier idea considered was to move the bookstore into where the seating 
areas of the cafeteria presently are found. "We'd wait and see how this went with 
the food service," Wallace said, adding that increased traffic flow could result in 
more students eating at The Fort. 

'That's the Catch 22, You bring the bookstore over here and 2000 more students a 
week and you have no place to eat," John Ulmer, dean of student affairs, said. 

Wallace told students that he would be willing to meet with a group of about six to 
12 representatives to discuss and finalize plans lor reallocating student 
organization office space in Walb. 

Wallace .said that if everything went as planned, changes would be fully com- 
pleted by the beginning of the Fall 19B7 semester. 

PWP organizes here

Stall Writer 

An international organization has 
formed a support group at IPFW to help 
single parents cope with problems 
unique to their lifestyles. 

Parents Without Partners iPWP) has 
recently formed a local chapter at 
IPFW which meets twice a month and 
offers support lo divorced or widowed 
parents. 

Joyce Frane, education director of 
the local PWP chapter, said, "The PWP 
program is designed to help its 
members feel good about themselves 
again." 

"After losing a spouse it is difficult 
for the person to learn to be an in- 
dividual again," Frane said, and "after 
catering lo a husband and children. 
many times it's important for the in- 
dividual to achieve a good feeling of 



self." 

The PWP program consists of a 
series of education classes related to 
single parenting, activities for the 
adults and children, and open 
discussions Some activities include 
dances, potlucks, movies, and bowling 
to name a few. 

Frane said that although PWP is a 
support group, many people perceive it

Pep band strikes 
a chord at games 

By JULIE MAG5AMEN 
SI air Writer 

When you think of high school bands, what do you remember? 

Do you remember the smell of fresh popped corn, sweaty gym shoes, and the 
excitement ot cheering your school on to victory? Do you remember the 
camaradane of being with your friends at ihe games? Do you remember how good 
it made you (eel to realize you were a part of that schooP 

Whenyouhear the "Star Spangled Banner," do your fingers itch to pick up your 
old instrument and play along? If so. the IPFW pep band, sponsored by the Purdue 
Alumni Association, has a job for you! 

The IPFW pep band needs music majors, non-music majors, full-time students, 
part-time students, inslructors. alumni, and friends interested in investing two 
hours a week in having a good time while urging their team onto victory The pay is 
free soft drinks, T-shirts, and admission lo the games. The benefits are numerous 
Besides meeting new friends, re-establishing that old musical talent, and the plain 
enjoyment of being a member of the pep band, you also gain experience and poise 
playing before a crowd. 

Lisa Wilson and Dan Bradley, co-direclors of the IPFW pep band, have been 
members lor two years. They both agree that they have gained valuable ex- 
perience 

"I've really developed good organizational and management skills by per- 
forming in the band. 1 also have a good time. We have an excellent crowd response. 
If we aren't there, they have lo play a recording of the "Star Spangled Banner" 
and have piped-in music That type of music is just not the same as having a live 
band The cheerleaders and team really appreciate us being there," said Wilson. 

"We're not looking for musical perfection. We don't yell at anyone who hits a had 
note. We're looking for people who enjoy having a good lime and who like being 
part of a band. We don't play any difficult music It's very similar to what high 
school pep bands play. We get together for an hour once during the week, and then 
for an hour before the game. After Ihe game we go for pizza or just talk. It's always 
a good time." said Bradley. 

The last meeting for this year will be held on Wednesday. Feb. 25 at 5:30 p.m. in 
Class room -Medical, room 35A. 

"Next year we hope toget in a few more meetings before the season starts. We'll 
be pretty Oexible on rehearsal lime and we'll try to work out a schedule that will 
work for everyone," said Bradley. 

If you miss that old excitement of playing before a crowd, the enjoyment of being 
with friends during the game, or the appreciation of the cheerleaders and team 
members for your support, then by all means, dig oul that instrument and be ready 
lo play in the next game. Remember, you're not only wanted, you are needed! 



IPFW offers opportunity to get involved 



iKdilor's note: This is the second 
article of a six week scries profiling 
IPFW alumni. On April e, IPFW alumni 
will be on campus to discuss their 
careers with students.) 

"Fort Wayne is not a university town 
— it's a town that happens to have a 
university, and that means there's an 
opportunity to do things here." 

That was the philosophy of David 
Nichols, a V979 IPFW graduate, during 
his college days. Nichols did such 
things as write part-time for ITie 
Jo urn a I- Gazette. He helped develop 
Focus Fort Wayne with IPFW faculty 
member Louis Cantor as a Bicentennial 
project assisted by the Indiana Com- 
mission (or the Humanities grant 

Nichols has continued "doing things" 
since college days. He spent ihree and a 
hall years compiling and editing the 
war correspondence of Ernie Pyle, and 
the ■ .Jit of a book. "Ernie's War."

Subtitled "The Best of Ernie Pyle's 
World War II Dispatches," the book is 
on best-seller lists around Ihe country. 
Nichols has made appearances in New 
York, Washington, DC. Cleveland, 
Cincinnati. Chicago. Houston, Dallas, 
Los Angeles. Albuquerque, Phoenix 
and Indianapolis lo promote the 
volume. 

At IPFW, Nichols prepared himself 
for such a stint by doing free-lance 
writing, working on The Communicator 
as a columnist and a feature writer, and 
getting television experience. He 



credits a creative writing course with 
Clifford Nault, an associate professor of 
English, and work with Walter John- 
ston and Sherman Goldenberg as being 
of great assistance to him, 

Nichols, publications supervisor at

Changes for the better? 



It's been quite a while since an IPFW 
Chancellor has had a question and 
answer session with students of this 
campus Many administrators have 
even denied the usefulness of student 
organizations — content to relish in their 
own professional advancement. 

Chancellor Wallace apparently has not 
., or so il appears Wallace met with 
over 100 students Sunday night to discuss 
changes in Walb Memorial Union, 
changes that would affect office space 
currently devoted to student 
organizations Students were mainly 
representative of greek organizations on 
campus, as well as Students' 
Government. 

Wallace apparently realizes the 
importance of student input or he would 
not have even shown up to meet with 
students lasl Sunday in the first place 
The big question \n this case, however, 
was ... was il just for shoW* 

Many things were lacking at the 
meeting that mighl have made students 
feel more important, more respected 
than they did after hearing Wallace 
speak at Sunday's meeting. 

Without question, we realize this 
university cannot leave all decisions up 
to students. That thought is ludicrous. 
However, students active on this campus 
do feel they should be consulted before 
any decisions are made which would 
affect their daily lives at IPFW, The 
students went into the meeting thinking 
they would be helping to make decisions 
about any reallocation of office space in 
Walb, What soon became apparent was 
that the decisions had already been 
made long ago. What the students 
thought was going to be a discussion of 
proposals turned out to be a discussion 
on the implemenlalion nf changes in 
office space that will affect their 
organization. 

Second of all, questions from the 
students concerning effective use of 

university advertising in The 
Communicator, promotion of campus 
activities as part of the university's new 
Fort Wayne advertismg campaign and 



the transition of a second floor lounge in 
Walb into a video-mediated classroom 
were left unanswered. Wallace's 
defensive, "none-of-your-concern" 
attitude left a bad taste in the mouths of 
the majority of students in attendance. 

One of the only positive things that 
came out of the meeting was a promise 
from the chancellor to meet with a 
smaller, representative group of 
students in attendance to discuss final 
plans on the redistribution of allocated 
space. 

It is essential that the chancellor 
follow up on this, making students feel 
they truly have a say-so in decisions that 
affect their lives here at IPFW, If this 
does not take place in the very near 
future, students will be left thinking the 
university can just shuffle them around 
whenever and wherever they please, 
without seeking Uieir suggestions and 
feedback. 

It is essential that this take place very 
soon because the chancellor is 
jeopardizing his reputation as being 
open-minded and concerned about the 
quality of student life at IPFW, 
Students, faculty and staff are beginning 
to see a "new" Tom Wallace emerge. 

If changes affecting quality of student 
life are not discussed upfront and openly 
with students, the students will likely 
become rebellious, uncooperative and 
belligerent. 

As mentioned, it is encouraging to 
have a chancellor willing to meet with 
students face-to-face. However, timing 
is critical. Meetings should be held prior 
to decision-making. Input needs to in- 
clude student and faculty response to 
proposals affecting them. Listening is of 
utmost importance. Not enough of that 
has been done around here by the ad- 
ministration in the last few years. 

Taking suggestions through the 
smaller committee is an excellent idea 
and is one that must materialize We ask 
but one thing ... don't waste our time or 
yours "patronizing" us if these decisions 
you say are still open to discussion are 
actually carved in stone. We're not in the 
mood for games. 



Pep club needs support 



"We've got spirit, yes we do We have 
spirit, how about you?" 

Well, IPFW do you have spirit? 
Evidently not! IPFW is fortunate 
enough to have a volleyball team ranked 
14 in the NCAA, but not fortunate enough 
J lo have fans in the stands. We also are 
not fortunate enough to have anyone 
wanting to take on the responsibility of 
raising school spirit and promoting the 
volleyball team and their victories. 

IPFW has one of the best volleyball 
coaches in the nation. Arnie Ball has ted 
the women's volleyball team to a 30-4 
record lasl year The women also won 
the Great Lakes Valley Conference 
championship. 

Ball has led the men's team to a 9-6 
record so far this season. The men's 
team is playing some of the best 
volleyball we've seen in a long time. 
Where are you at game time'' 

We are well aware this is a commuter 
campus, Bui this is also a University. 
Everyone wanted to go away to college 
because they heard there is more to do at 
Bloominglon or Lafayette There are a 
lot of things lo gel involved in at IPFW. 
However, the student body of this 
campus does not take full advantage of 
the opportunities offered us. 

An important suggestion to be 
considered is the forming of a "pep 
club" for the volleyball teams. Although 
this isn't high school, if we can have 
cheerleaders at other sporting events, 
why not a pep section al volleyball 
matches? Everyone in the sports 
department thinks il is a great idea to 




have a pep club Did anyone offer to help 
set up the club? Coach Ball is very eager 
to help enhance student involvement on 
this campus, and he would surely help. 
but why should he be the only one'' 

Ball IS coaching both men's and 
women's volleyball and is the newly 
appointed athletic director. He is busy 
enough 

Shari Eger is the sponsor-coach of the 
cheerleaders. There are usually six girls 
on the squad, however, this year there 
are only four. If Eger assigned just two 
or three of the girls to make 
appearances at matches on a rotating 
basis, enthusiasm would undoubtedly 
increase. If each girl could take time to 
make posters to hang in Kettler Hall and 
Walb, maybe we could get something 
started. 

It is hard enough to get students of this 
campus motivated lo attend sporting 
events. Just saying that a pep-club is a 
good idea is not good enough The 
students that are interested in helping 
out their volleyball teams should have 
some support and guidance. Who belter 
lo help raise spirit than cheerleaders or 
their sponsor? 

II is a difficult job to do cheers at a 
volleyball match but it is not an 
impossible one. If four cheerleaders are 
not enough to go around, then maybe 
consideration should be given to the 
establishmentof two squads next year ,, 
one for the basketball team, and one to 
lend support deserved, and earned, by 
the Volleydons 

Come on athletic department! You 
finally have students that would like to 
get involved and are interested in a team 
on campus Lend a hand.

How about this one: "Hi, I 
see that you're carrying 
some school books. Do you 
go to school here''" 1 gel 



great responses with that 
line. They give me this look 
like they've just re-tasted 
every great meal they've 
ever eaten at The Fort. 

Being the perceptive

that I use frequently with 
fantastic results: "Hi, my

you're usually free around

Let me tell you, that one

They get as excited as a

* Homecoming' makes audience work and squirm 



By RICHARD E. 

JOHNSON 

Staff Writer 

Pinter's ■'Homecoming" 
opened al PIT lasl Friday 
On Saturday, 1 experienced a 
well-performed showing o( 
Ihis daring and provocative 
showcase of demenled life in 
an England town 



Review 



the 



As I outlined 
preview, Ihe play is about a 
family of four men whose 
son- brother hath returned 
from being a philosopher in 
America. The young man. 
leddy, hath also returned 



with a wife, and the rest of 
the family play mind games 
with one another in an effort 
to deal with life 

The production of Pinter's 
work was. I'm sure, nearly 
what Pinter had in mind. 
However, as off-lhe-wall as 
the man is, 1 don'l think he 
could have, as I barely did, 
sal still for Ihe corny, and 
often fading. English ac- 
cents Occasionally, I ex- 
pected the cast to ac- 
cidenluUy fall into a 
borrowed Monty Python 

But nevertheless, the play 



served the purpose of both 
Pinter and director. Joel K, 
Murray. Purpose: to make 

the audience work and to 
make them squirm. I 
worked. 1 worked al trymg to 
figure out exactly what each 
character really wanted lo 
say, as opposed to what they 
were saying. I worked at 
trying lo understand what all 
of Pinter's little symbols 

And I squirmed. I squir- 
med at the thought that 
people could treat each other 
inlhew'ay these people did I 
squirmed at the scheme that 



the father and two brothers 
had concocted to abuse the 
prodigal's wife for their own 
frivolities, I also squirmed 
out of lethargy Lethargy 
thai consumed me at times, 
because there really wasn't 
much going on to satisfy any 
sense other than hearing and 
perception, save the oc- 



lal cloud ot cigar 
smoke billowing from the 
stage. 
Murray had me. al times, 

wondering which actor 1 
should have been watching, I 
suppose that was his point, 
but sometimes I found 
myself, as a friend said of 
-Gandhi," -watching the 



of Ihe s&lt; 
All in all il was a mixed-up 
evening, tosay the least. The 
plol. if any. was mixed-up. 
Ihe Pylhonesque, dark, 
comcdic dialogue was 
mixed-up. And I was mixed- 
up as lo whether I should 
have been fascinated or

Review 



Listening to 'Athens In- 
side Out. The Soundtrack to 
Ihe Movie," 1 noticed right 



uway the amazing influence 
thai R.E.M , Athens' 
favorite children, have had 
on the various bands 
featured in this compilation. 
Not that this is bad; 
B.E.M : is in my opinion the 
grealest band on the 
music scene today, and Ihey 
are pioneering a new sound 
which is unlike anything I 
liave heard before. Two new 
covers by R E.M, grace this 
soundtrack, a wonderful 
version of the Everly Bros, 
hit, "lAII 1 Have lo Do Is) 



■'Swan Swan H" from their 
latest album "Life's Rich 
Pageant" on l.RS. records. 

The various Athenian 
bands [ealured all have a 
unique sound, combining 
blues, country and 
psychadclic sounds into a 
musical movement worthy 
of the reputation this city is 
getting. 

The album is produced by 
Bill Cody, and is available on 
I.R.S. records and tapes.

Spring is in the air 
Already the weather out of 
doors is warming up. Soon 
there will be buds on all of 
the plants, and the birds will 
be tiack from their winter 

Any morning now, 
thousands of people will 
stare al the racks of clothes 
hanging in their closets. 
I'hen, as they wipe the sleep 
out of their eyes, they will be 
hit with the thought of "I 
don't have a thing to wear!" 
Just as the last remnant of 
snow is melting from the 
ground, everyone starts 
thinking about revamping 
their wardrobe. 

Pastels, a perennial sign of

Phil Bodine: talented 
athlete makes impact 



Bj GINA JONES 
Managing RdJIar 

rPFWs Phil Bodine, a 
graduate of North Side, 
played baskelball, eind 
parlicipaled in track in high 
school He did not play 
volleyball So how did Coach 
Arnie Ball discover Bodine' 

■'He knew I played 
basketball and high-jumped 
in track. The other volleyball 
players Tefd" park board 
(Parks and Reerealionsi 
volleybull matches and 
they'd leli him about me. So 
one day I went to talk to 

"He said he'd heard good 
things about me, and that I 
was a lairly decent athlete 
and then he gave me papers 
to sign to go to school. Then 
he took me to the gym and 
told me lo set a few balls and 
then make four or five block- 
jumps against the net." said 
Bodine. 

Since joining the 
Bodine has played an in- 
tegral part in the Mastodons' 
success. His first s 
the Volleydons he played the 
position of middle-hitter. 
Last 

quarterback of the squad, 
playing the position of seller, 
Bodine began this season, his 
third on the team, as the 
setter 

Last Friday Coach 
changed Bodinc's position to 
"Phil is the best 
athlete on the team. He can 
play any position the coach 
puts him in He was passer 
tonight, and he '

at first, but he did a great 
job," Loren Gebert, an 
assistant coach, said after 
Friday's win against Ohio 
Stale. Playing against Ohio 
State. Bodine had (our kills. 
three blocks, 12 digs, and two 



level to play the game, he 
can be as good as any player 
that has been at this 
university," Ball said. 

Bodine won the award of 
most improved player his 
fr(shman year But lo dale. 



I Ins opinion, the highlight 
of his career was this year 
when he was voted on the all 
tournament team in the Fort 
Wayne National Bank 
Classic. The highlight of last 
season was "gelling lo know 
my coach better on a per- 
sonal basis, and being able to 
play against teams thai are 
only dreamed about — like 
our trip to California during 
spring break " 

Qodine's outlook for the 
team for the rest of the 
season IS "if we pull together 
and help each other out as a 
team, the sky's the limit, we 
can go anywhere we want. 
For myself, I'd like to play to 
the best of my ability and 
fulfill the role ul leadership." 

Bodine is a junior 
majoring in business and has 
one year of eligibility left. 
"I'd like to end my 
playing teams like we did my 
sophomore year: playing 
California teams. I'd like to 
earn a team position lor a bid 
in NCAA final four." 

■'I wouldn't be here if it 
weren't for Coach Ball. He 
has spent a lot of lime with 
me. Not only improving my 
volleyball, but improving me 
as a person, He's one of the 
besl coaches m the nation I 
feel (ortunale to have him
