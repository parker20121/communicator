Fall schedule change predicted 



By LILLIAN LYON 
Copy Editor 

Efforts by the Registrar's office io solve scheduling conflicts may cause 
significant changes in next fall's class schedule. 

Jack Dahl. IPFW registrar, has been trying to Solve a problem in the slating of 
evening classes, Classes meeting one ni^t a week will be fazed out; "We've been 
discouraging the scheduling of undergraduate classes (meeting one night a week) 
in departments where students in a number of programs would enroll because this 
can cause difficulties for a student who is taking other classes at night," Dahl 
explained. 

This would eliminate the conflict between classes such as those meeting Mon- 
days from 6 to 9 p.m. and classes meeting Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays 
(rom6to6:50p.m. 

However, solving one problem may createothers. 

"Classes meeting once weekly are more convenient tor working students. It s 
easier to inter-work both schedules. They I the registrar) better keep us in mind," 

Financial aid 
deadline approaching 



said Bart Akey, a sophomore Supervision major. 

Many students rely on taking classes that meet only one night a week; some 
students may be employed full-time and take a different class each night, others 
may work three or four nights a week and take classes on the other evenings, and 
still others may come from long distances and take one night a week classes to 
decrease driving to For t Wayne. 

"1 think the students do well with classes that meet one night a week," said 
Robert W. Hawley, associate professor of Mental Health Technology. 

Hawley feels a longer class time, which a one night a week class entails, gives 
professors a chance to include activities such as guest speakers and films, in 
addition to lecture and discussion. 

He continued, "We need to provide as many opportunities as we have students; a 
variety of class limes ( should be offered ) for a variety of students." 

The elimination of one night a week classes is not a set policy yet, said Dahl. Fine 
arts classes, intra-departmenlal classes, seminars, graduate classes, and 
laboratory classes would not b e aiiccted by the change,

Students need to file their Financial 
AidFormslFAF'sl now. 

"We want to have studenU file as 
soon as possible," said Richard 
Bellows, associate director of financial 
aid. 

While there is no deadline for filing, 
students who send their FAF's before 
March 1 will receive preferential 
treatment, said Bellows. "It's never 
too late, you (the student! shouldn't 
give up hope if you miss March i." he 
said. 

Eligibility and available funding 
have changed very little since last 



year, said Bellows. "The only change 
that might happen is the interest rate 
for GSL's (guaranteed student loan- 
si," he said. If there is a rate change. 
Bellows expects the rate to go up one 
or two points. 

In recent months, the news media 
have publicized proposals to reduce 
federal student aid programs, 
"Everything is proposed at this time," 
Bellows emphasized, "Ninety percent 
of what you hear is for 1937-88," he 
said. 

Documentation tor • student ap- 
plications should also be easier this 
year, said Bellows. 




Joan Eaton, associate director of financial old. says that although March 1 Is the 
deadline for slate financial aid, IPFW will continue to receive applkaUons until

IPFW offers five financial aid programs 



Bv JULIE MAGSAMEN 
Staff Writer 

Three thousand and four students of 
IPFW will receive $6,063,393 through 
campus based financial aid programs 
during the 19B6-87 academic year. 

Although the deadline for applying 
for state aid is March I, 1986, Joan 
Eaton, associate director of Financial 
Aid, encourages students to keep 
applying for the various programs. 
"We will continue to accept ap- 
plications luifil the money runs out," 
Eaton stated, 

IPFW offers five major student 
financial aid programs: the Pell 
Grant, the Supplemental Educational 
Opportunity Grant. College Work- 
Study, the National Direct StudenI 
Loan, and the Guaranteed Student 



The Pell Grant is an award to help an 
undergraduate pay for their education 
after high school The grant is usually 
used as a "foundation" which aid from 
other sources may be added This 
grant does not have to be paid back. 

The Supplemental Educational 
Opportunity Grant (SEOGl although 
very similar to the Pell Grant, is 
different in the aspect that only a very 
limited amount of money is set aside 
for this grant. When the money is gone, 
the SEOG is finished for that academic 
year. Students applying for this grant- 
must make sure that they meet all 
deadlines. 

The College Work-Study is a cam- 
pus-based program that provides jobs 
for undergraduate and graduate 
students who need financial aid, A 
C:WS job is arranged by the campus. 
Academic progress, health, and class 



schedule is taken into consideration for 
each student applymg for this 
program 

The National Direct Student Loan is 
a low interest loan available to full- 
and part-time students. Payment for 
these loans begin G months after 
graduation. The student is allowed up 
to 10 years to repay the loan. 

The Guaranteed Student Loan is a 
low-interest loan made by a lender 
such as a bank, credit union, or 
savings and loan association. These 
loans are insured by the guarantee 
agency in the state and reinsured by 
the Federal Government. 

Each year a budget is established by 
congress for financial aid. The money 
is then dispersed to the different 
schools throughout the nation. The 
Financial Aid Department must then 
budget their money to fit the different 



types of students applymg for aid- 
Each individual student has a different 
set of circumstances the Financial 
Department strives to meet. The 
student living with parents has a 
different set of circumstances than the 
student who is a resident. Single 
parents and retired individuals fall 
into another category. 

The Financial Aid Department 
reviews each application and offers 
each applicant a program or com- 
bination of programs that best fit their 
needs. 

As the applications for financial aid 
increase steadily each year, the need 
tor verification of income becomes 
mandatory. In order to speed up the 
process of the aid. students are urged 
to bring in a signed Ux return when 
applying lor aid. 



Allen honored as Big Sister of the Year 



By JAMES GARCIA 
Staff Writer 
Sandy Allen, an IPFW mental health 
technology student, was selected in 
November as Big Sister of the year for 
Steuben County tor 1985, at their an- 
nual awards banquet in Cold water. 
Michigan. 

Allen has been a Big Brothers-Big 
Sisters volunteer since 1983. She 
became a Big Sister, she said, because 
she understands the trauma that a 
child can go through, and how they 
need someone with whom they can 
share their thoughts and emotions. 

An Angola native, where she did the 
bulk of her work for Big Brothers-Big 
Sisters. Allen plans to live and work in 
the Fort Wayne area after graduation, 
hoping to find a career in social work. 
She is presently doing a pracUcum at

To anyone Interested in helping 
children cope with the pains of growing 
up Allen warns. "It's not something 
that should be seen as a passing fancy. 
It's a commitment." She added, a 
prospective Big Brother or Big Sister 
should be prepared to spend at least 
one day a week with the child they are 
matched with. 

"Most of the children are eager to 
get into it," said Alien. Often the 
children simply do not have anyone at 
home to communicate with, she said. 
Contrary to what many people might 
think, these children are basically 
well-balanced, average kids who just 
need someone to talk to. Occasionally 
a child may be having severe problems 
at home and they need special coun- 
seling; in such instances the 
caseworker will provide either direct 
counseling or referrals 



University reputation important for independency 



ByEARLSMlTH 
CTilet Reporter 

After six years of joint campus operation at Fort Wayne, Dr Boyd Keenan found 
"a host of problems' ' and faculty debating independency. 

The Indiana Commission on Higher Education commissioned Keenan, a 
professor of political science at the University of Illinois-Chicago Circle, to study 
the operation of Indiana's regional campus program and recommend changes in 
governance and the curriculum oflerinp- 

While some issues only affected Indiana or Purdue, Keenan found it a difficult 
process to separate intra-university problems from inter-university problems, 
"Overwhelming the whole setting, for the most part, is the friction resulting from 
ha ving two administrative structures." said Keenan. 

Establishing the position o( chancellor, an executive who would answer to both 
university presidents, eliminated many problems, said John Ulmer, dean of 
StudenI Services. But an often unspoken ambivalence remains. 

Robert Novak, associate professor of English and linguistics, feels one point of 
ambivalence is the value of being independent. Most faculty cite the reputation of 
being associated with Indiana or Purdue as a plus. 



Would students be concerned with the university name on their diploma or 
merely with the quality of that education? Would enroUment be affected? These 
questions would be difficult to answer. 

Separation from Indiana and Purdue Universities could cause a decline m 
enrollment if alumni insisted on sending their children to Bloomington or West 
Lafayette, instead of to Fort Wayne 

"If we were independent, we might gain in some areas of graduate education 
which could offset undergraduate enrollment drops." said Ulmer 

On the other hand it would be more difficult to attract quality people, said 
Ulmer "Therearehundredsof city universiUes,"hesaid. 

"1 think we could build a dorm of 500 students if we were independent," Ulmer 
said- Increased unity and sense of community could be developed by the con- 
strucUon of dorms. 

"Dorms would help to develop friendships," said freshman Sara Zarick. "When 
I came to IPFTV it was like changing high schools in your senior year, " she said 

Before becoming independent, IPFW needs to obtain greater vwio.. of its pur- 
pose and future as an institution and as an element of the Fort Wayne coinmuni'.y.

Deadline extension 
raises suspicions 



If you saw an advertisement for a job 
and the deadline published for all 
applications was too soon for you to 
prepare and send in your resume and 
application, would you still go ahead and 
apply? 

Apparently, the IPFW Chancellor 
Search and Screen Commillee thinks so. 
The Communicator reported last week 
that the Search and Screen Commillee 
had decided to extend Ihe deadline on all 
applications for Ihe chancellorship. 

The extension was announced because 
the advertisement was not published in 
the Chronicle of Higher Education a 
sufficient number of times to allow 
interested parties to apply. In the end, 
legally, the ad did appear the required 
number of limes, but the committee still 
decided to extend the deadline 
However, according to John Huie, 
secretary to Ihe search and screen 
committee, the extension was not 
official, meaning the published deadline 
was never changed. In all the 
publications, the advertisement still 
gave a Feb, 3, 1986 deadline, Huie 
explained Ihe committee "within Itself," 
had decided to extend the deadline to 
Feb. 12, 1986 at 3:30 p.m. i Ihe time of Ihe 
committee's meeting lime last week) so 
Ihey could consider late applications. 
According to Huie. only "a couple" 
applications were received after Feb. 3. 
This whole issue raised a few 
questions on campus. 

First of all, if Ihe published deadline 
was never changed, how would anv 
interesled parties know that it was okay 
to send in applications until Feb. 12? The 
action only raised suspicions that the 
deadline was extended to allow certain 



individuals time to be considered for the 
position. It seems inconceivable that 
anyone worth the education behind their 
degrees would even consider sending in 
a late resume. 

If the advertisement had appeared a 
number of times, as it did, any candidate 
thai would wail until the last minute to 
send in an application should be subject 
to suspicion. One of the qualities that 
the committee is seeking for in our 
future chancellor is "senior 
administrative ability." Does abihty to 
handle all deadlines fall under this 
category? It should. 

Finally, why ■■informally" extend the 
deadline at all? The advertisement 
appeared in "all the major publications" 
according to Joanne Lantz, a member of 
Ihe search and screen committee. Would 
one ad m The Chronicle make that much 
difference? Apparently not, in light of 
the fact that the commillee received so 
few applications after Feb. 3. 

They say knowledge is 80 percent 
hindsight, and that phrase appears to be 
true. This "informal" extension has 
raised too many questions. 

It does not seem fair to the candidates 
who did take the time to get their 
applications in on time to "bend the 
rules." 

Were the few that submitted their 
applications late worth all this 
suspicion? 11 would be terrible lo see 
these late applicants be the chief 
administrator of our campus, if they 
cannot handle a simple deadline. 

In any case, it will be interesting to 
find out in March the names of the final 
candidates, and the dates that their 
resumes and applications were 
submitted. 



Furthermore... 



Radio-TV-Film students are not the 
only ones to express dissatisfaction 
about the Communications-Theatre 
department, as expressed in last week's 
editorial. 

Many Interpersonal and Public 
Communication majors responded with 
less than glee when informally polled 
aEout their department. Among the 
commonly cited problems: three 
instructors leaving in quick succession 
of each other, the severely limited 
posted office hours of the faculty, 
■■passing the buck" behavior, and the 
availability and order in which courses 
are offered. 

Last semester, students were given 
the chance to take the one 500 level 
course open to Interpersonal majors, or 
not graduate. Would we have to put up 
with this on a larger campus? We think 
not. 

To make the situation worse, half of 
the class had not taken the prerequisite 
for the class and had no choice in the 
matter because the schedule was 
changed at the last minute to 
accommodate the hasty retreat of one of 
the Communications instructors 

Which alternative is more injurious to 
the student? An instructor thrust into a 



course at the last minute, or the student 
not having taken the prerequisite 
course? We think the student is 
shortchanged, in this case, by tieing 
forced to sift through material presented 
in class without the benefit of 
background information. Is this the type 
of education students deserve for their 
money? 

Students are being further 
manipulated by a lack of continuity. 
Many Interpersonal classes are built to 
follow a logical progression upon which 
interrelated theories are based. What 
possible good will it do students to have 
two very different instructors for this 
sequence? 

Popular opinion is that this 
department is "passing the buck" to 
keep us taking the classes they see fit, 
period. 

A scene from Cool Hand Luke comes 
into mind here: Paul Newman is a 
member of a chain gang who steps out of 
line, after being shown the route chosen 
by the guard. The guard strides over and 
explains, "What we have here is a lack 
of communication." Then Luke is 
promptly pistol-whipped into 
submission.

-Letters to the Editor 



To the Editor: 

With alt the speeches on 
the slate of this and the stale 
of that, from the likes of 
Reagan, Orr. and Moses. I 
find it implausable not to 
have a few words about my 
home away from home. Here 
then is the "Condition of the 
Campus, IPFW," 

Well il's still here. It's cold 
outside the buildings and in 
some as well. It's still a very 
long walk from [he 
Multipurpose Building to 
Keltler Hall (and vice 

As well as getting a little 
easier to find parking spaces 
(sometimes).. 

There is a feeling of 
crossmg the intemationa! 
date line, because a time 
warp still exists between 
Campus buildings. The 
clocks all showing different 
times is still normal. 

I observe that most 
students have found where 
their classes are being held, 
as well as most of the in- 
structors have finally found 
where their classes are 
beingtaught Plus, nearlyall 
students have deciphered 
the all-elusive syllabus, or 
have thrown it away in 
disgusted defeat. 

New students find the 
library fairly bewildering, 
whereas the older more 
experienced students know 
this and go to the downtown 



public library. And with this 
advantage or disadvantage, 
however one looks at i(, 
some students have a hard 
lime keeping up with class 
work ; a few are even Iwhind. 

As of the 20th of January, 
the balance checks were 
available from the Bursar's 
Office; that meant, a number 
of students will be able to 
buy the luxuries of life, like 
food. Speaking of such, the 
food at the Fort in the 
Students Union is still the 
best buy tor fair tasting 
nourishment. 

For those that need their, 
MTV, there is the T.V. in the 
union, as well, if one can get 
it away from those that 
watch the soaps. 

The book store (Folletfs) 
still seems to be making a 
killing on the cost of books, 
in regards to the buy-back 
rate and Ihe price of used 
books. Think about i(. 

Toy Mastodons that are 
stuffed can be liought 
wherever fine money-raising 
items are for sale 

As in all great times there 
are a tew odds and ends that 
need to be acknowledged ... 
here are some: 

Though we now offer 
medical training, we still 
don't have a campus nurse 
on staff, although we have a 
lawyer. Contemplate that for 



Child-c 



campus has 



improved. It's now off 
campus at that place across 
SI . Joe Road. 

LRC gang is yet as slow as 
il has l&gt;een before, due to the 
lack of lead time on the huge 
amount of tasks that they 
are asked to perform. 

A new, bigger, belter 
Animal Containment (for 
lack of a superior word! 
Center, is in the process of 
construction. And speaking 
of construction I rest 
assured that we will have a 
new Arts Building some- 
hoere, sometime in , \\\p,, 
future. Maybe here, maybe 
downtown, maybe out in the 
country someplace, f Winch 
in the long run would keep ail 
those luney artists and 
wacko performers out of 
sight and out of mind of all 
the mundane people i 

Now for matters of 
heavier conotation...The 
enrollment is down due lo 
Reagan's great economic 
policies. And the campus is 
yet temporarily leaderless, 
bul is nevertheless looking 
tor the right person to fill the 
pair of odd sized shoes. 

All in all. the campus is in 
good condition. It has been 
around well over 20 years 
and one assumes that it will 
be around another 20 years 
(in one form or another) ... 
hopefully growing with the 
times as it has in the past. I 
encourage students, staff. 



and administration to 
respond and comment on 
this letter, as well as the past 
year and the years to come. 

With a little apathy, deep 
respect and regards, I 
humbly submit the 
preceding evaluation,

*Luther' examines a life of supression 



Kv M.KATHLEEN 

GREVEN 

Features Editor 

The scene is set. Loosely 

woven panels of jule are 

draped from (he ceiling. 

Larger than life effigies of 

monks gtmrd the dark 

passageways of the 

monastery, bells toll and 

incense swings. 

Review 

Enter M.irlin Luther, 
a.k.a. Joel K Murray, clad 
in only a loincloth, ready to 
don the outward trappings 
he's already adopted 
spiritually. Once clothed in 
the coarse robes of a monk, 
Luther begins to fulfill a 
promise made as a child. 

Legend has 11 that Luther 
was struck by lightning and 
swore to a vision of Saint 
Ann that if he lived, he'd 
devote his adult lite to being 

Luther's decision was 
hearlily disapproved of by 
his father. Luther Sr. wanted 
his son to be a lav/yer. He's 
more concerned lor how he'll 
survive with a son who's 
haircut looks like "an egg 
vi'ithii beard." 



This superficiality per- 
meates the play Luther Sr 
stated that monks are only 
good for washing dishes or 
begging for money in the 
streets, because those are 
Uie only encountei^ he's 
cared to have with the 
religious community. 

In another scene, (he 
monks are confessing to 
their sins communally. 

During this scene. Luther 
blurts out, "I am a worm!" 
He's on his knees, baring hJs 
soul in a freeform manner. 
while the rest of the moidts 
are confessing to their trivial 
sins of looking at women or 
not having the candles ready 
for Mass in time These 
perceived sins are further 
trivialized by the sing-song 
manner in which they were 
delivered. 

Luther's tirade is ignored 
until he utters them in the 
prescribed manner — "I 
confess ..." He prayed into 
the open space for answers 
to tiis imagined sins. The 
prayers and absolutions 
were all repeated as if by so 
many parrots — with all 
attention paid to the form 
and not much to ihe content. 



H only a prayer existed to 
deliver Luther from his 
chronic constipation ! " ) 

Murray convincingly 
portrays the prosression of 
the wide eyed novitiate 
riddled with anxiety and 
doubt. subservianCly per- 
forming menial chores to the 
man who was ultimately 
responsible for fracturing 
the Roman Catholic 
following. 

Tlirough the course of this 
history lesson, we are 
capably entertained by Pope 
Leo, Kevin Poling; Tetzel, 
Jason Fulk and his jester, 
Terry Alberding They are 
able to tred that fine line 
between making light of the 
situation and mocking it 
totally, as the situation 
dictates. 

On the more solemn end of 
the scale are Carlo Garcia. 
who introduced each act 
with the thump and flourish 
of his* banner, and Salch 
Gatchell, the perfect devil's 
advocate as Luther's father. 
Both are given the chance to 
develop into characters with 
very specific opinions atwut 
the "goings-on."

The IPFW men's 

volleyball team defeated 
12lh-ranked Ohio State 
University Friday night at 
home. The game was a 
personal victory for the 
Mastodons, who had been 
beaten by the Buckeyes the 
previous three times they 
have been matched. 

Coach Ball comments, "It 
wasn't hard to get the guys 
motivated for this game. We 
didn't prepare any different 



than for any other game. 
After losing last week after 
being up 2-0, the team knew 
they could beat OSU, they 
knew what they had to do 
and they did it. This time we 
were ready and our strategy 
worked." 

The first game of the 
match didn't go as the 
volleydons woiJd have liked. 
After Joy Goldsteyn served, 
the Ohio Slate team scored 
immediately. IPFW took a 
quick 3-1 lead after thai only 
(o never see the margin on 



Mastodons could 
be spoilers 



their side again. Ohio State 
built a lead the Mastodons 
couldn't catch, and won the 
game 11-15. 

Game two went according 
to plan for IPRV The men 
look a quick Z-0 lead and 
never tell behind. The men 
fought their way out of a M 
lie (o eventually go on and 
win game two 15-8. 

The third game of Ihe 
match was similar, with 
IPFW never losing the lead. 
OSU lied il at 9-9, but Phil 
Bodine made a great play to 
bring the volleydons back to 
lead, 10-9. IPFW went onto a 
13-9 lead before the

The volleydons rallied Ijack 
to a 4-3 lead and never would 
fall behind again. Great 
plays by Loren Gebert and 
Phil Bodine brought us up 10-

the Buckeyes a chance to tie 
the score 10-10. The 
Buckeyes never got l)ack on 
the board. The outcome of 
the game was a 15-10 win by 
the Mastodons. The
