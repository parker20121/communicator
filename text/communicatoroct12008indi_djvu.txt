Omnibus Lecture Series presents 

John L Esposito 

A critical time for United States foreign policy 



By Kelly McLendon 



The first Omnibus lecture 
look place on Wednes- 
day, Seplember 24th 
in the Rhinehan Music 
Center. The spcaicer was 
John Esposito, a George- 
town University profes- 
sor and author. 

At the student 
session with Esposito 
earlier in the day, the 
professor talked brielly 
about the subject matter 
for the evening and then 
opened up the floor for 
questions. He discussed 
the difference between 
American and European 
Muslims and told many 
anecdotes about how he 
began his career. 

The evening lec- 



ture started with an iniro- 
duciion by Irene Walters, 
who is executive director 
of University Relations 
and Communications. 
Christina K. Smith, who 
was once a student of Es- 
posilo's, also gave a brief 
introduction, detailing 
the professor's work. 

Smith described 
Esposito's newest book. 
Who Speaks for Islam: 
What a Billion Muslims 
Really Think, which is 
co-authored with Dalia 
Mogahed, as Uie "larg- 
est, most comprehensive 
study of contemporary 
Musiimseverdone." Dur- 
ing Esposito's research 
for his newest book, he 
and his team conducted 
over 50,000 interviews 
virith Muslims over a span 
of six years. 



Esposito took the 
stage and began by rein- 
forcing his many years 
of research, stating thai 
when he began in the 
field, Muslims were "in- 
visible in the landscape.' 
He made a point of spec- 
ulating that many people 
would not have gone to 
such a lecture ivith 'Mus- 
lim' in the title several 
years ago, addressing 
that American citizens' 
have had a growing pho- 
bia of all things Islam af- 
ter Septcmberllth. 

"1/4 of Ameri- 
cans do not want a 
Muslim as a neighbor," 
he said, referencing his 
book. Regarding what 
Muslims resent about 
llie West and what they 
admire, they admire the 
technology, democracy. 



freedom and work ethic 
in the West and resent 
the foreign policy deci- 
sions. 

He also dis- 
cussed how only certain 
information about Mus- 
lims actually goes into 
the news. The media 
does not typically pub- 
lish facts about Muslims 
denouncing terrorism. 
Due to political aggres- 
siveness and ignorance. 
"Post 9/11. anti-AniiTJ- 
canism has grown gloh- 
ally." Esposito said. 

In regards to 
what he would say to 
the next president, ho 
paused dramatically 
"We've gone astray," hv 
said. "The military is not 
equipped to fight a war 
against global terror- 
ism."

"We will not see a de-

Woody Meyers, Senior 
Advisor to Sen. Barack 
Obama Campaign for

According to the 
Pew Research Center, al

students does not have 
health insurance, and 
most others have inad-

Polar Bears losing homes; how to help 



By Kelly McLendon 



Popular environmen- 
tal activist group Green- 
peace is currently show- 
casing an exhibit called 
the "Street Art" project 
in Washington, D.C. The 
purpose is lo showcase 
how polar bears are be- 
ing affected by the rising 
sea level. 

The venture is a col- 
laboration with promi- 
nent artist Mark Jenkins. 
Jenkins is internation- 
ally renowned for his 
street art productions. 
The project's format is 
simple. 

"Greenpeace and Jen- 
kins added polar bear 
heads and ragged cloth- 
ing to human figures to 
convey a sense of dis- 
placement and home- 
lessness," according to 
the official Greenpeace 



website. The figures 
were then distributed 
around Washington, 
D.C. 

Statistics from the 
organization say, "Arc- 
tic sea ice has reached 
ils second lowest an- 
nual extent in recorded 
history." The area lost 
by the sea level fluctua- 
tions can be compared 
to a "habitat three times 
the size of Texas" that 
is now gone for polar 
bears living in the Arctic 
sea region. 

The rising sea levels 
aren't only affecting po- 
lar bears, however. 

"The Intergovern- 
mental Panel on Cli- 
mate Change (IPCC) 
projects that millions of 
people ivilt be displaced 
by global warming in 
the next few decades." 

There are many ways 
you can get involved to 



help i-vith this cause. First. 
you can go lo ivww.green- 
peace.org and sign a pe- 
tition to vote against off- 
shore drilling. The Senate 
will be votingon this issue 
soon. If the Senate votes 
for this, the polar bear 
could face extinction, as 
its habitat would become 
virtually non-existent. 
Signing the petition is ver&gt;' 
easy and takes less than a 
few minutes. 

Second, you can visit 
vvivw.stopglobal warming, 
org and become part of 
the Slop Global Warming 
Virtual March. 

The-site says. "The Stop 
Global Warming Virtual 
March is a non-political 
effort lo declare thai glob- 
al warming is here now 
and it's time to act." 

From the site, you can 
pclition your mayor to 
reduce carbon emissions, 
read about how reus- 



able bottles cut down on 
waste and much more. 

The final sile|to visit 
in order to learii more 
about what you can do to 
help the global warming 
crisis is the U.S. Environ- 
mental Protection Agen- 
cy (www.epa.goV). There, 
you can lake quizzes to 
determine how much 
you knowabout reducing 
cost and energy, actually 
view a report that details 
how electricity in every 
town is generated and 
send in any questions or 
thoughts you may have. 



This November, col- 
lege students around 
the country ivill have a 
chance to make a huge 
impact. By simply exer- 
cising your responsibility 
to vote you can initiate 
change ihat betters the 
lives of not only yourself 
but the people around 
you. 

By voting you are 
saying thai you support 
the system of govern- 
ment that we celebrate 
in the United States. By 
voting you are endors- 
ing certain policies that 
you believe would make 
this world a belter place, 
and ultimately, you are 
showing respect and ap- 
preciation for everyone 
who has worked so hard 
to establish and protect 
liberty. 

We all know lhat the 
college-age demograph- 
ic does not participate in 
elections as much as oth- 
ers. This has a direct im- 
pact on the entire group. 
even those who actually 
vote. Older people are 
more likely to get what 
they want from govern- 
ment, simply because 
they vote. We need lo 
borrow this concept. 

If college students 
voted in large numbers 1 
predict the cost of higher 
education would de- 
crease. 1 also believe we 



would have easier access 
to goods, and afford- 
able health care while in 
school Quite possibly 
our govertiment could 
make social progress 
more quickly. We would 
be able lo do big things 
if our elected officials 
i\trv forced to respond 
111 more of our concerns. 

1 highly encourage 
my fellow students to get 
iiifdrnied on the issues 
and play an active role in 
the 2008 election. If you 
have the lime or resourc- 
es, you can even volun- 
teer for a campaign. 

For those planning to 
vote in Indiana, remem- 
ber lo properly register 
by October 6 or you will 
not be able to vote on No- 
vember 4. If you have re- 
cently changed address- 
es you will need lo make 
sure that the change is 
reflected on your voter 
registraiion. 

For those who may 
not have the time to fill 
out a voter registration 
in person or mail one 
in, you can hnd volun- 
teers on campus who are 
more than happy lo help 
you get registered. Jusl 
look for the individuals 
ivith clip boards. They 
are generally stationed 
around Kelmke Library 
and Walb Student Union. 

Thanks to all who 
have helped the process 
by gelling involved wiih 
campaigns, registering 
people, or simply dis- 
cussing important issues 
with others. And ihanks 
to all who will be voting 
this November.

U.S. engagement lacks diplomacy and respect opEd 



By Said EL-Dajani 

Editor- 1 n-Chlcr 

President of Iran, 
MahmoudAhmadinejad, 
visited the United States 
lasl week in what seems 
lo be his nnnuul address 
to ihc nation regarding 
his countries nudear and 
social impetus. 

Lastycar's unwelcome 
visit to New York City was 
a memorable one, where 
Ahmadinejad was insult- 
ed and discredited before 
his keynote lo Columbia 
University students. Not 
lo mention a rejected re- 
quest to lay a i,vreath at 
ground zero by city of- 
ficials, Ahmadinejad has 
made an effort over the 
years to tame and tackle 
the American lexicon. 

Whetlier it is through 
his squinty-eyed smile 
of deception or his for- 
eign lone of reason, the 
Iranian leader has been 
arguably far more civil 
and diplomatic than the 
voices that speak for our 



nation. Our current in- 
trusive preconditioned 
diplomacy' or our 'capi- 
talistic prodding' we call 
foreign policy, is an un- 
popular etiquette recog- 
nized by the global com- 
munity. 

While Iran and lis 
leaders may have used 
language sensitive to 
America's sound bite so- 
ciety, the mainstream 
media has played an in- 
tegral role in consistently 
destroying Iran's cred- 
ibilit&gt;' as a terrorizing 
Muslim country, out to 
facilitate if not assist in 
destroying Israel. 

In contrast. IPFW 
Omnibus Lecture Series 
speaker, John L. Esposi- 
to. speaks positively of 
the predominantly tribal 
and nomadic country. 
The Georgetown Univer- 
sity professor of religion, 
international affairs, and 
Islamic studies, high- 
lighted through his book, 
Who Speaks for Islam: 
What a Billion Muslims 
Really Think, the grow- 



ing dislike for American 
foreign policy, calling 
the broad phenomenon, 
"Anti-Americanism." 

Dalia Mogahed, ex- 
ecutive director of the 
Gallup Center for Mus- 
lim Studies and Bsposi- 
lo's co-writer, said polls 
showed that people in 
Muslim countries feel 
disrespected by the Unit- 
ed Slates. According to a 
New York Times article 
regarding a report seek- 
ing engagement with 
Muslims by diplomacy, 
disrespect is a sentiment 
that intensified with the 
invasion of Iraq and the 
photographs from Abu 
Ghraib prison showing 
detainees tortured and 
humiliated. 

In correlation to Ah- 
madinejad's disdain for 
America's social neg- 
ligence, Esposito wor- 
ries. "America has lost 
its moral authority. Now 
we're losing our financial 
authority," he said in re- 
sponse to the recent in- 
stability of our flnancial 



sector. 

Our next president 
needs to prioritize the 
countries objectives 

In the political arena, 
Obama and McCain rep- 
resent polarized stances 
that strongly define the 
future of the world and 
the role of the United 
States. 

While Obama maybe 
regarded as more intel- 
ligently tied to economic 
issues, we must under- 
stand that Obama is only 
as strong has his advisors, 
experts in which he con- 
sults. Regarding foreign 
policy, Obama is already 
recognized globally as a 
more suitable and bet- 
ter distinguishable can- 
didate. His position on 
Pakistan. I believe, is pre- 
mature and represents a 
compromise to adminis- 
ter war if need be. 

McCain on the other 
hand, proves to be short- 
sighted and war hungry 
- enough said. What little 
diplomacy he may ad- 
minister will probably be 



with allies. Esposito em- 
phasizes the importance 
of communicating with 
Muslim countries and es- 
tablishinghealthy oppor- 
tunities for employment 
and citizen transaction. 
"The way forward is edu- 
cation and exchange," 
says Esposito. 

We live in a market 
driven society and we 
may still be in the mind- 



'Battleground' Indiana depends on student voters 



By Adam Beckett 

Stud«nti foi Barak Obama 



Students across cam- 
pus are excited about 
this years presidential 
election and are anxious- 
ly a\\-aiting their chance 
to vote. But you won't be 
able to vote if you aren't 
registered by the dead- 
line of Monday, October 
6. 

On Election Day, all 
you need is a \'a!id ID is- 
sued by either the state 
or federal government 



to show poll workers, 
and for students at IPRV 
your student ID counts 
at the polls. If you don't 
have a state issued ID, 
such as an Indiana driv- 
er's license, you can use 
your passport or a mili- 
tary ID. If you request an 
absentee ballot, no ID is 
required. 

You can check your 
registration or register 
for the first time online 
at www.voteforchange. 
com, or look for IPFW 
voter registration efforts 
around campus. 

This election is an ex- 



citing one for Democrats 
in Indiana. 

According to the most 
recent polls - including 
last week's Indianapo- 
lis Star poll that showed 
Obama ahead of Mc- 
Cain in Indiana by three 
points - the Hoosierstate 
is shaping up to be one of 
the most hotly contested 
batdeground stares of 
the election. 

The race here is tight 
and every single vote is 
crucial. Barack Obama 
has invested unprec- 
edented resources in In- 
diana, having opened 32 



offices around the state 
with the help of thou- 
sands of supponers, in- 
cluding hundreds here 
on campus. The effort 
has put in place an ex- 
tensive grassroots orga- 
nization that's working 
in all 92 counties. 

But all of that doesn't 
matter if you don't vote. 
We have the chance to 
make history this year 
in Indiana. Make sure to 
register by the October 6 
deadline. 



set of not speaking the 
enemy's language, a le- 
thal combination that 
postpones peace and 
prosperity. According 
to Esposito, it will prob- 
ably take a miracle for a 
particular candidate lo 
come around to diplo- 
matic engagement and 
regrets saying, "It might 
have lo get worse before 
it gets better."

Top Ten 

job interview tips 

1) A solid resume is important. It shows that you have the 
ability to lie. 

2) Your resume should describe your accomplishments 
with action words like "created," "oversaw," or "deep 
fried." 

3) Short on references? You can make a "previous employ- 
er" with just a pair of buttons and an old sock! 

4) Dress better than the job you're applying for. Ifit's a ca- 
sual office, wear a suit and tie. If it's a formal office, wear 
a tuxedo. If it's a tuxedo rental shop, wear a ball gown. 

5) If there are other candidates waiting, be polite and 
friendly. Say something like, "Nice to meet you! I'm the 
CEO's nephew." 

6) Greet the interviewer with a warm smile, a firm hand- 
shake, and a pat on the rear. 

7) When asked why you want to work there, explain that 
your dream job was already taken by Vanna White. 

8] When you have to explain why you left your last job, 
just say that they replaced you with a machine. At least, 
he sure looked like a robot... 

9) If the interviewer asks where you see yourself in five 
years, don't say "Driving your car, taking your kids to see 
Weekend Dad." 

10) The interviewer will want to know if you have any 
questions about the job. Be sure to ask when nap time is. 



Chancellor addresses new alert system 



Indiana University- 
Purdue University Fori 
Wayne (IPFW) keeps your 
safety on this campus as 
a top priority. In order to 
continue to do thai, the 
university has installed 
an Emergency Notifica- 
tion System (ENS) that 
\vill allow university of- 
ficials to contact you via 
telephone, e-mail, or text 
message in the event a 
situation arises on cam- 
pus that could alfecl your 
safety and security. 

IPFW is collecting 
Alert Phone Numbers 
(APNs) from students, 
faculty, and stafT so an 
ENS message can reach 
you on your preferred 
phone. An APN is differ- 
ent fromyourlPFWoffice 
or student housing land 
line telephone number 



and can be a cell phone, 
home phone, or another 
number you designate. 
All IPFW land line tele- 
phones and IPFW E-mail 
addresses are already 
registered in the system. 
In deciding what num- 
ber to use as your APN 
you may wish to con- 
sider possible scenarios 
that could be relayed to 
that telephone: 

&gt;Weather conditions 
have closed campus 

&gt;Utihty problems are 
a^ecting campus 

&gt;A hazardous male- 
rial incident is affecting 
campus 

&gt;Hostile activity is affect- 
ing the safety of people 
on campus 

Once registered, your 
APN will not be used for 



any other purpose and 
it will remain absolutely 
confidential. Messages 
delivered to you will al- 
ways be brief, informa- 
tive, and provide you 
with directions to ensure 
your safety. 

A system-wide test of 
the Emergency Notifica- 
tion Systems will have 
occurred on September 
30. Email addresses on 
file and APNs provided 
will have been used dur- 
ing the [est. 

To enter your APN. go

Aspiring artists hit crossroad 



Be on the lookour tlirs 
winter reason for two 
emerging singers and 
songwriters. Joel Way- 
man and Tifani Richard. 
In ihcir ihird year of col- 
lege the two aspiring mu- 



sicians are at a crossroads 
of sorts, debating if they 
should change their ma- 
jor to music or continue 
towards a career in hu- 
man services. 

"The thing is, though, 
we don't read music," said 
Richard. "We just play by 
ear. I was in band in mid- 
dle school and just played 
by ear then, 



too. 




who you are. not giiing 
up, and being your self," 
said Wayman. "They ex- 
press who you are and. to 
mc, are a sort of emotion- 
al release." 

Richard has influ- 
ences of Bob Marley and 
Corinne Bailey Rae, as 
well as most types of soul 
music. Wayman, however, 
keeps his influences close 
to home. "M . "She sings 
and has always been there 
for me — she's always been 
on stage for church and 
I've looked up to her as 
an artist. She's done stuff 
Willi Shelter Shed, a local 
Christian band." 

Both artists grew up with 
music being a big part of 
their lives and have both 
been singing since be- 
fore they can remember. 
Richard's family is very 
involved with music. "My 
grandpa played guitar 
and grew up with B.B. 
King. He could have been 
famous but hislamily was 
more important to him 
than to purstie music," 
said RJchanf ■'- 
"My mom always told 



me the story of when I 
ivas bom," started Way- 
man, laughing. "She said 
that when I came out of 
the womb, I didn't cry— 
they slapped me on the 
butt and 1 started sing- 
ing." Wayman has been 
singing "ever since then". 

Richard also had simi- 
lar experiences grooving 
up. "My favorite song as 
a child was always 'Don't 
Worry, Be Happy' and I 
would sing it all the time. 
Instead of crying, I would 
be in my room singing the 
song in a sad voice." 

Both Richard and Way- 
man have tried out for 
American Idol on numer- 
ous occasions. In addi- 
tion, Wa)Tnan has tried 
out for America's Got Tal- 
ent and Making the Band 
4 with little luck. Way- 
man made it to the fourth 
round of Making the Band 
4, but ended up being cut. 
"The biggest obstacle in 
pursuing a musical career 
would be that they like to 
say NO," said Wayman. 
"You are going to get told 
NO so many times until 



you get that YES." 

"My brother keeps tell- 
ing me to stop going to 
American Idol and to just 
record," said Richard. "All 
of my family is behind me 
100%." Wayman's parents 
are also behind him com- 
pletely. "It's just kind of 
hard since we play piano," 
said Richard. "Guitars arc 
so transferable. Pianos 
are big and heavy." 

It is obvious that mu- 
sic means a lot to both 
of these artists, who usu- 
ally sing to get their point 
across. Both Richard and 
Wayman both stated they 
liked the works of John 
Mayer and Lenny Kravitz, 
who both make world- 
wide issues known in 
their songs. 

"You can't just decide 
to completely one day 
change who you are; it's 
a thing that really both- 
ers me about Hollywood," 
said Wayman. "Look at 
Avril Lavigne. She start- 
ed out doing punk rock 
songs and now she is 
moving towards the pop 
genre. You have to slay 



true to yourself" Richard 
also wants to be unique 
and not conform to music 
industr\' standards. She 
likes the unique sound 
of their music and abil- 
it&gt;' to play songs from a 
variety of genres without 
completely changing who 
she is as a person and the 
sound of her music. 

"1 think we both can do 
anything... rock, soul, pop, 
we can do whatever. I 
think it's realty cool and 
something that's going 
to be different about us," 
said Wayman. The duo 
wants to invest in an Ap- 
ple iMac laptop and cre- 
ate an in-home studio. 

"1 feel hke if we record it 
the songs will seem to be 
more of our own. If you 
give a producer your song 
and to edit and mix the 
lyrics, they will have a dif- 
ferent view than you had 
originally imagined. We 
don't want that to happen 
to our music," said Way- 



Sec o h d Annual Tr o I ly To u r 

brings slice of heaven to Fort Wayne 



By Abbi Kopen 

stall Writer 



Who knew that heaven 
on earth involved trol- 
leys? September 24, 2008 
was the tenth annual 
"lYoUey Tour hosted by 
the Fort Wayne Museum 
of An. Tickets were S25 
for adults and S20 for stu- 
dents which may seem 
steep but boy do you get 
your money's wortli. It 
involved food, fun, trol- 
leys and different e.xhibi- 
tions as multiple shuttles 
escorted groups 
of people 



from one art museum to 
the next throughout the 
Fort Wayne area. Eleven 
galleries were included 
in tlie mix and each had 
some sort of cash bar 
and ^Timmy food to chow 
down on. Many of Fort 
Wayne's finest restaurants 
catered the event, such as 
Oyster Bar, Chops. Cat- 
ablu. and Bourbon Street 
Hideaway to name a few. 
Starting out at the Fort 
Wayne Museum of Art, the 
exhibit was tided 
C n - 



temporary American Re- 
alism; Biennial 2009 and 
will be up until Novem- 
ber 2, 200fi. Pieces of diis 
exhibit included "Bus to 
Istanbul" by lulie Unruh. 
Catering was done by the 
Oyster bar and had the 
most delicious chicken 
chowmien served in Asian 
cuisine take out boxes. 
Next stop was the Karen 
Moriarty studio and gal- 
lery off of West Columbia 
Street. This gal- 
I ery 




open May through 
December and includes 
Karen's oil paindngs, 
draivings and giclee re- 
productions, all of which 
were featured in the tour 
and were very impres- 
sive. Meaty and succulent 
shrimp were served with 
a spicy cocktail sauce 
thanks to Trolley Steaks 
and Seafood. 

An unexpected stop was 
at Great Panes Glass Co., 
which is a quaint studio 
that has been around for 
over 30 years. Located 
off of North Wells 
Street, this fine 
showcase had 
beautiful glass 
art in the form 
of jewelry, vases. 
lampshades, 
panels, and even 
entryways. With 
a line stretching 
outthe frontdoor 
people crowded 
together to view 
the gorgeous 
stained, fused, 
mosaic, bev- 
eled, and mir- 
ror glass that 
was an abso- 
lutely spectacu- 
■ sight. Great Panes 
Glass Co. also offers 



classes in stained glass 
and fusing. To make the 
stop even more enjoyable, 
Bourbon Street Hideaway 
squeezed in to serve up 
hot and ready chicken 
and sausage jumbo with a 
delicious Cajun kick. 

The University of SL 
Francis was next on the 
list featuring James Vale- 
rio: Recent Paintings 
and Drawings. This is a 
definite must see with 
its enormous still life 
and figurative paintings. 
Inventive and incred- 
ible, these paintings are 
enough to make one Stare 
in amazement ai how 
someone could possibly 
capture such amazing 
light, shadow, and form. 
Unfortunately, the exhibit 
will only be up until Octo- 
ber 26. 2008. Catering was 
done by AVI Fresh serv- 
ing warm spinach and 
artichoke dip with torti- 
lla chips and two differ- 
ent kinds of roll up sand- 
wiches, all very fresh and 

Our last stop was the 
Casde Gallery off of West 
Wayne Street, which ev- 
eryone in Fort Wayne 
needs to see at some 
point Not only is the ar- 



chitecture of the home 
itself enough to attract 
those with an eye for 
greatness, the entire "cas- 
de." built in 1905, is filled 
with beautiful paintings, 
sculptures, and more. 
Many famous pieces were 
donated from some of 
the most talented artists 
in the world including 
Gelasi, Larkin, Pulley and 
Cheers. lim Davis, the cre- 
ator of Garfield, also had 
a few featured pieces on 
the second floor. Catering 
was done by Club Soda 
and they served chicken 
salad sandvflches. 

Unfortunately, it is im- 
possible to see all eleven 
galleries in 4 hours when 
one has a mind that tends 
to wander. Other Galler- 
ies included Artlink. The 
Orchard Gallery, and the 
Kelly Advertising Build- 
ing on West Wayne Sl, as 
well as First Preshyierian 
Gallery, Kachmann Gal- 
lery, The Pearl Gallery and 
Rat Art. If the trolley tour 
didn't make it onto your 
calendar this year, be sure 
to catch it next year as it 
is a fun filled night that 
almost anyone is sure to 
enjoy.

Hispanic Heritage Month 

IPFW's Hispanos Unidos 
brings community to the 
Jorge Gonzales Fundraiser 
downtown Headwaters 



By Dan Jehl 



Saturday, September 
27, was Ihe official proc- 
lamaljon day for Hispan- 
ic Hcrilagc Month. It was 
a 13-hour celebration 
with over 1,000 aitcnd- 
ees. Hispanos Unidos, 
an IPFW student orga- 
nization, took the high 
pro/lie road and made a 
difference. 

The celebration be- 
gan with an official proc- 
lamation by Fort Wayne 
Mayor Tom Henry de- 
claring Sept. 15 to Oct. 
15 Hispanic Heritage 
month for the city. Then 
Mayor Henry gave his 
mayor's lapel, worn since 
hisjanuary inauguration, 
lo Jorge' Gonzaiez, a 15- 
ycar-old Miami Middle 
School teen suffering 
from kidney failure, and 
said, "This day is for you. 
1 want you to grow up 
to have a chance to be a 
doctor or a lawyer and 
have a good life." 

All proceeds from 
the day's non-stop mu- 
sic, food, and fun mara- 
thon were for the Jorge' 



Gonzalez Trust to fund a 
transplant operation at 
Riley Hospital in India- 
napolis. 

This event was unique. 
II was the first time His- 
panic Heritage Month 
was featured at Headwa- 
ters and officially recog- 
nized by the city's Mayor. 
The Headwaters event 
was of interest not only 
to the Hispanic commu- 
nity. There were over 40 
national heritages show- 
ing community support 
for the cause. Countries 
of origin included Anglo 
nations through the al- 
phabet to Venezuela. 

Hispanos Unidos, the 
IPFW student organiza- 
tion, showed action and 
communityinvolvement. 
Wearing IPFW Hispanos 
Unidos t-shirts, the group 
raised funds for forge' 
Gonzalez by selling food, 
face paintings, holdEng 
raffles, and facilitating 
interactive game. 

As the day's sun re- 
treated in early dawn, 
some of the group's 
member decided it was 
time to dance. 

The entertainment 
was also perhaps a first. 



Bands and dancers per- 
formed from noon un- 
til 11:00 p.m. Dancers 
from Ecuador displayed 
an Ecuadorian flag and 
a banner depicting sup- 
port for Jorge' Gonzalez, 
who is of Mexican heri- 
tage. The Unity Founda- 
tion Voices of Unity Youth 
Choir, a multi- cultural 
choir and only one of- 
ficially-endorsed by the 
Indianapolis Colts, dedi- 
cated a song to Jorge' and 
communicated with the 
audience in both English 
and Spanish. 

This unique multi- 
cultural celebration also 
had a worthy cause as a 
benefit to help a family, 
Hispanos Unidos made 
a difference and made 
its mark with action and 
community involve- 
ment. 

If interested in par- 
ticipating or Icitming 
about Hispano Unidos, 
the group is open to stu- 
dents of all cultures and 
meets on Wednesday 
afternoons in Walb Me- 
morial Union. Check the 
Union schedule for exact 
times and dates.

Student Housing 
Next Top Model 

A community 
building program 



By Kelly McLendon 



Sludenl Housing will 
be hosiing its oivn ver- 
sion of Ihc popular TV 
show, America's Next Top 
Model. An open casting 
call for the eveni begins 
on Monday October 6, 
from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. in 
Cole Commons. After the 
casting call. 20 finalists 
will be selected. 

The final selection 
is different from the TV 
show, in the aspect that 
the competition is not 
just limited to women. 
Men can also participate. 
Every week, one man and 
one woman will be elimi- 
nated. 

Participants can expect 
weekly challenges, along 
with photo shoots. Each 
week, the photos ivill be 
ctitiqued and climina- 
lion will follow. Prizes in- 
clude gift cards, clothes 
and accessories, plus the 
opportunity lo vrin two 
modeling sessions with 
Fori Wayne's resident 
modeling school, Char- 
ma ine. 

DcAngelo LaVelte, a 
resident assistant who is 
coordinating the event 
said he sees many people 
around campus who look 
like they should model. 
lie wanted to work with 
the program because he 
likes lo walch America's 
Next Top Model and 
thinks the IPFW version 
is a good idea because 
males are included in Ihe 
competition, loo. 

"It's beneficial to all 
sorts of people," said La- 
Vette, "It will boost par- 
ticipation. It will help 
student housing emo- 
tionally, too." 



LaVetie said he no- 
ticed a few students don't 
have very high self-es- 
teem and he believes the 
event could help them. 
He also hopes the com- 
petition might bring 
more students out to get 
involved in campus hap- 
penings.

Some of the examples the alerts sent to your
