Senior fine arts major Alisha Dunkleberger recently replaced her "Gorilla" sculpture, 
which was stolen in November, with this leg iron. "The rusted leg iron is broken to 
commemorale Ihe theft of the original piece. The leg iron is located in the small gar- 
den area in the courtyard between Helmke Library and VValb Student Union. 



Information Technology 

Services changed the email plat- 
form students hove been using 
lor mare than a decade on cam- 
pus during Spring Break 

The new emnilsyslcm, called 
the Novell Internet Messaging 
Syslem, or NIMS, uses a weti- 
based interface through which 
users log on, said William W. 
Baden, coordinator of academic 
computing al IPFW. 

The NIMS platform 

the GroupWi! 



nIPFW 



feature-rich e-mail environ- 
ment" Ihat includes oolions like 
an easily editable adaress book, 
a calendar, a help page and con- 
trol over email settings like the 
language in which text in NIMS 
appears and how many mes- 
sages are displayed on screen at 
any one lime, Baden said. 

Student email addresses have 
not been altered as a result of the 
platform cfiangeover according 
to Baden, US will also continue 
to host and offer use of Ihe old 
DMaiT and PINE email sys17ms 
through the end o! Ihe semester. 

ITS has been sending out 
informational flyers as well as ,i 
mass sludenl emailing to 
announce the change. 

STEPS short courses on Ihe 
use of the new NIMS interface 
are available. 

ITS has also changed the old 
student web space manager. The 
new syslem is no longer based 
on Ihe web, but relies on Ihe 



campus network. 

Students who have web 
pages provided by the univctsl- 
ty will now have to log into Ihe 
IPFW network as they would at 
any of the campus labs to man- 
age Iheir web site files. Shidenls 
will find a new pr drive in addi- 
tion lo Ihe programs and drives 
available for network use. The p: 
drive acts as any other drive or 
folder on a computer. Users 
delete and add new files directly 
to the p: drive iiulcad of upload- 
ing Ihem to the old student wcb- 
-■■; manager. 

"When in a lab or classroom, 
updating web page^ will be as 
easy as editing, copying and 
dcletingfiles in a folder," Baden 
said. "T&gt;&gt;c old Web Manager 
method of updating files no 
longer works.' 

Students who want to access 
their web space from off cam- 
pus, will be able lo do so 
through a new web interface, 
called "iLogin," 



the I 



lall 



addresses, student web space 
addresses will remain the same. 
rrS is also no longer requiring 
shidenis to activate Their"n/eb 
space. All Sludenls now have an 
activated sile with 10 megabytes 

ITS workers spent 13 hours 
creating accounts for each stu- 
dent and copying all messages 
and web pages lo the new envi- 
ronment, Baden said.

NIMS and student webspace,

Irene Farrera to appear in concert March 29 



Singer brings 
Latin soul from 
Venezuela . 



Irene Farrera (Ee-reh- 
Fah-rre-rah) ivill perform March 
29 in Ihe Walb Student Union 
Ballroom at 7;30 p.m. 

Farrera's first language was 
music. Her earliest memories of 
Venezuela are full of song and 
dancing. 

"Music is part of every cele- 

says Ihe Oregon resident. 

By the time she was six, she 
could sing dozens of aguinoldos 
or holiday songs. She loved the 
rhythm of Venezuela's joropo 
and gaila music, too. Since then, 
her constant companion is Ihe 
cualio, Venezuela's national 
instrument that is simitar to Ihe 
guitar. 

Initially coming to the United 
Stales to study archileclure. 
Farrera was drawn back lo her 
musical roots and quickly estab- 
lished herself as a regional 
favorite in the Pacific Northwest, 

Her distinctive deep, low 
voice and unique percussive gui- 
tar style sel her apart. 

Critics lauded her first three 
albums, "Soy de Ti" (Tndigena 
Records, 1»9). "Alma Latina" 



(Redwood Records, 1995) and 
"U'alking in the Jungle" (Same Sea 
Music, 1993). 

Farrera's latest album, 
"Serena la," traverses the 
Venezuela's diverse regional 
styles, iveaving in four original 
Farrera songs along the way. The 
highly syncopated, flamenco- 
iniluenced joropos, driving fulia 
and gaita rtiythms of Ihe coastal 
regions, and unique native 
instrumentation create a spell- 
binding and sublirne musical 
e.iperience, 

Farrera's repertoire includes 
original songs and music from 
Lalin America. She sings in

^rom Diehl's comments about the Prraidenl being the moral role 
del lor our nation to look up to, and his emphasis lime and agam 
Ihe moral depravity of our nation, I olien wonder if I am reading 
olilical column or a charismatic evangelical sermon. 

I [owever. the article in the March 6 issue lakes the cake. Not only 
1. Mr. Diehl continue his quest to right the wron^ of the moral 
ir.ivity of Ihe United Slates and praise C.W. as a breath of fresh air 
-n Mr, Clinton, but he also beliltfes Mr. Gilbert and tics him in with" 
murderers and drug addicts that Hollywood puts fonvard as

This is a good school. At an entiemely fair price, a student can 
obtain a quality education in nearly any field. I believe that many of 
the instructors caie about their classes and students. MosI of the cam- 
is seems to exlubit an open-door p^oticy. t have been very happy 
th my decision Io allcnd IPFW as opposed to other options. 

There "is, however, a strange dichotomy of actions on tliis cam- 
is with one unifying component. It should come as no surprise to 
anyone that money is one ol the largest priorities tor the leadership 
this campus, as can be evidenced in the fact thai tliey turned down 
; temperature in all Ihe buildings lo save on energy eipendilurcs. 
Given that obvious precedent, il should not be a shock that Ihe school 
would be inlereslca in renting oul rooms for community organiza- 
lions to utilize during Ihe day, H a room is not scheduled for a class, 
II stands lo reason that offering the opporluruty for its use con gener- 
ulra income for Ihe university. 

But what in What if that room is the primary hiding place for 
many sludenls on campus? VVhal if chemistry and biology students 
in the Science Building like lo retreat lo this room lo study in relative 
quiet? What if this is Ihe only room tfiat was actually open lo students 
all day long? One that actually had a door lo shut out the noise from 
Ihelobby? Wouldn't it also stand to reason thai these students would 



feel displaced and cheated if "renlers" Ihal used the classroom for- 
upwaitis of eight lo 10 hours per day suddenly took their one haven, 
of peace and study? '. 

Consider Ihe flip side of Ihc coin. When was Ihe last lime you. 
ever slopped in the hallway lo talk lo someone about the Maslodon 
game the nighl before? The university recently made a jump \o\ 
Division I, regardlcssof Ihe fact that we couldn't even win in Division' 
II {volleyball excluded). In Ihe meantime, the varsity teams, withouiL 
a building of their own, regularly monopolize the Sports Center for| . 
their practices and workouts. In my cslimalion, IPFWisonly loo will- 
ing to pour money down the sports hole ui the hopes mat it will 
strengthen their image as a "real school. ' 



Once high schoolers want lo come to Ihis school because of its| • 
reputation as a quality institution the sports will follow (see St.j 
Francis). Stop marginalizing the students and irtslead focus yourl 
efforts in their direction. |

IPFW. In fact, I use Ihe facililies there quite often. Understanding that 

small school. I often encounter members of IPFWs oTfieia! 

.:ams as they train and practice in the Gates Center. Because 

the Gales Center is a shared facilily. 1 understand when, lor example, 
Ihe gym is closed for a boskelball shool-atound or the track is closed 
for track and field practice. 

What's aiutoying are the strange groups ol people in the Gates 
Center that seem lo have absolutely no formal association with IPFW. 
1 have two (juick examples. First, the other day 1 was surprised to find 
myself sharuig the tracK with a group of around 25 high school soccer 
players and track enthusiasts, ■fhey seemed to be everywhere on the

Forgotten heroes 

On the six-month anniversary of the Sept. 11 attack on our way of life, justice 
demands that we acknowledge an overlooked hero: the businessman. 



Fittingly, in the wake of Sept, 11. there has 
been n growing appreciation of Ihe vilal impor- 
tance of our police and our military in defend-, 
ing us against attack. 

But Ihc terrorist assaults should have also 
underscored Ihe crucial role of another group ol 
American heroes. The deeds of those individu- 
al, unfortunately, continue lo go unrecognized. 

Remember that as admirable as our men in 
uiuform are. (ve would be better off if their 
courage were not needed~i,e.. if there were no 
criminals lo jail or foreign aggressors lo defeat. 
Their actions derive meaning from the values 
they dedicate themselves lo ptolccling— the 
values commonly described as the "American 
way of lile," But what is Ihal exactly — and who 
is responsible for creating il? 

To those who have caught even a glimpse 
ol dail)! life in Afghanistan, the contrast to life in 
Ihe United Slates is shocking. In that primitive 
counlty there are few cars or paved roads, no 
shopping malls or bountiful grocery stores, vir- 
tually no high-rises, little in the way ol enler- 
lainmenl — be it television or movie theaters or 
conceri halls— few hospitals, no high-tech 
devices. What there is. m abundance, is the 
back-breaking labor of a subhuman existence. 
Unlike America. Afghanistan has scant material 
weolth and virtually no induslnalizalion. 

Why? What explains this lack? Only one 
factor the absence of freedom, 

Afghanistan has been a country without 
liberty. Its citiiens had no right lo Ihirik lor 



themselves: their "thoughts" were dictated by 
theTaliban.Theyhadnoright topKjperly: what 
meager goods they managed to produce was 
loot lor the nearest warlord. They had no right 
to pursue their own happiness; their lives were 
supposed lo belong to God and to the stale. 

The American way of life is. fundamental- 
ly, a life of individual liberty. Devoid of the free- 
dom that America's men in uniform safeguard. 
Afghanistan lacked the type of person who 
flourishes under freedom: the businessman. It is 
the free mind of Ihe businessman thai raises the 
capital and creates Ihe methods by which Ihe 
discoveries of science are transformed mto com- 
mercial products. 

It is the businessman ivho invents assem- 
bly-line production and turns the alitomobile 
from a curiosity lo a necessity, 11 is the business- 
man who figures oul how lo deploy the latest 
discovery in chemistry into a fertilizer that 
boosts agriculhiral yields. It is the businessman 
who coordinales and directs vast amounts of 
capital and labor in order lo build transconti- 
nental railways, colossal dams, occan-hopping 
passenger planes and electrical generating sta- 
tions. 1 1 is the businessman who is among the 
first to recognize the value of innovatioi\s, 
patiently waiting for others lo sec what he has 
seen— and so builds a Microsoft, which raises 
everyone's standard of living. 

The businessman is the one who devotes 
his mind to producing wealth. The businessman 
is the creator of the American way of life— a life 
of prosperity and progress made possible by 



freedom. Without his present and past actions, 
our daily lives would resemble the dismal exis- 
tence of the Afghoius, 

The terrorists, who m their words 'love 
death like Americans love life," understand the 
connection of business lo life. Thai is why they 
struck at the symbols of commercial success: the 
skyscrapers of Ihc World Trade Center, Il is lime 
ive grasp that same connection. 

Rather than denounce businessmen when- 
ever the pricc'of gasoline rises (and, when it 
falls, take that as proof that Ihe price was too 
high in the hrst place)— ralher than habitually 
casi busmessmen as the villains in our TV 
shows and movies — rather than smear all busi- 
nessmen for the dishonesty of a few who want 
to get rich not by production, but by fraud — we 
should praise the producers. 

The attacks of Sept. 11 have made people 
more acutely aware of the value of Ihe 
American way of hie — and of those who defend 
it. But Ihe many businessmen who perished on 
that dale, and their thousands of brothers-in- 
spirit who survived, are the men who make that 
way of life a daily reality. 



Republicans and their 
strong work ethic 

Some liberals woulc" like von lo believe that Ihe 



do have lo agree that most rich people do most 
likely belong lo the Republican Parlv; tul it is nol for 
Ihe same reasons that liberals would have repetlti'ously 
blasted inIo our heads. 

People who are rich and who have earned Ihe'ii 
wealth are not Republicans solely because Ihcy wani lo 
have half their hanJ-enmcd income taken from them 
and given to the poor who refuse lo work. 

Rich people understand fu-ical politics, and. if for 
no other reason than thai, t&gt;picalK- aren't liberals. Rich 
people underiland that \iiu t.iiiiioi get ahead in life by 
simply silting in In^nl of Ihe lelfveiion all day, watching 
Ihe soaps and e.iting pol.ilo chips .md ,i Diet Coke. 

Rich people liave .i work elhic, and don'l like lo 

S've to those who refuse to work. Frankly. I don't blame 
em one bit, either. I would verv sternly refuse to help 
anyone financially who is capabfe of working bul refus- 
es lo do so. 

If a man will not work, then neither shall he eat. 

Back in 19%, the Republican Party was able to 
push through drastic \vcl fare-reform, written up by fis- 
cal conscA'ativcs who understand how to gel ahead in life 

Back in 19%, liberals screamed that Republican 
efforts to move people out of the ranks of welfare 
ivould backfire, sending an additional one million chil- 
dren into poverty. 

Todav. there arc actually 23 million fewer children 
in the ranks of poverty than when the Republican's wel- 
fare-reform w.is enacted. 

In 1996, there were five million families in 
Temporary Assisl.uicc to Needy Families, and today 
there arc onlv two million, the lowest figure since llie 
early 1970s, ' 

In fact, many liberals were outraged al the oul- 
landish demands set on the impoverished to became 
responsible for themselves, pushing them totvard work 
and selling lime limits on their welfare assalonce. 

Wendell Primus, who resided Ireim Ihc Oinlon 
administration in protest of the inclusion of such stan- 
dards, has been so impressed with the success, thai he 
nD^v suggests Ihey should be continued.

families 

olf welfare and into working jobs, 

at'mg the best possible environment for the childri^i 

The next sicp in removing even more children from 
poverty, as President George W, push aims, is promot- 
ing hvo-parent homes among the poor. Tlie rate of out- 
of-wedlock births rose from eight percent in 1965 Id 33 j 
percent in 1994, The rale has llatlened since Ihe welfare 
reform wa5-enaclerf.—~-- — " 

Because two-parent homes have the capability lo 
bring home hvo checks at the end of the week, many 
more families can begin lo exit the ranks ol poverty. 

The benefits of Iwo-parenl families arenuge. 
Children growing up williout a married mother and 
father are Hvice as likely lo drop out of school, over 50 
percenl more likely lo have a child themselves as a 
teenager and over 50 percent more likely lo abuse alco- 
hol or drugs. 

Since 1997, the work-parlicipalion rale has risen 
from 25 pen:ent to around 50 percent today and Bush 
desires to see stales aim for 70 percent work- par lid pa- 
lion by 2007. 

Sure, many Democrats tvoutd just as soon have the 
government late money from the (veallhy and present 
It lo those unwilling to work, bul some, like our former 
Governor EvanBayh (D-lnd.), is ccvsponsoringa bill in 
the Scnata with Tom Carper (D-Del.), 

Their bill, dubbed the "New Democrat" bill, echoes 
Bush's desire lo increase Ihe wotk-participallon rale by 
2007 and agrees wilh Bush on Ihc need for more 
emphasis on involved fathers. 

Liberals would like you lo believe that the GOP is 



why would Ihe Republicans have put lc%elher such a 
successful plan to get people olf welfare? 

The answer is simple. Republicans do care about 
Ihe Impoverished, but refuse lo allow people lo collect a 
paycheck for silting on their sofa. 

You gel aheacf in life by working hard, whether 
you're in middle-management or a production line 
worker in the local factory. If you work hard, you will 
get ahead in life, and ihc Republicans want to share 
these tips wilh the poor, who in recent years Ihe liberals 
have brain washed to believe that the government owes 
them something for doing nothing. 

Bul hey, I mean, if the Republicans hadn't gotten 
their ivay back in 1996, jusl Ihmk how many more mil- 
lions of people Ihc Democrats would have on welfare, 
raving a deafening blow lo Ihe 'Bloodless War of 
Commerce' by creating a huge govenunen I and paying 
its cJlizei\s to do nothing. 

Frankly, 1 am Ihrilled to watch our impoverished 
ciliiers bcgm lo lake responsibility for themselves and 
their families. By lak ing thai res ponsibi lily, (hey gain 
pride — pride in themselves, their families and thcif jobs.

Purdue thefts result in more than $39,000 in losses 



WEST LAFAVETTE, Ind, |PU 
News) — Purdue University 
police are investigating thefts 
over the past 10 days ol more 
than $37,000 in computer equip- 
ment from two engineering 
buildings and more than S2,O00 
in concession equipment from 
Lambert Field ho use. 

"Someone knows about these 
thefts," said Ron Fosnaugh, cap- 
lain of Purdue Police Special 
Services. "Now that everyone is 
back from spring break, we are 
asking people lo be aware of 



recovery of property and the 
arrest of the pwoplc responsible." 

Fosnaugh said the thefts from 
Lambert included various con- 
cessions and a hot dog grillcr 
and nacho cheese machine, 
items that should capture atten- 
tion if seen on or around cam- 
pus. Police estimate the value of 
properly reported slolen at 52,275. 

Computer equipment was 
stolen from two adjacent facili- 
ties, the Mechanical Engineering 



and Electrical Engineering 
Buildings, during spring break. 

Seven IBM Pentium laptop 
computers and two Eip dnves. 
valued at more than S30.500, 
IV ere reported slolen Friday, 
March 8, from a locked metal 
cabinet in Room 263 of Ihe 
Mechanical Engineering 
Building. There were no signs ol 
forced cnlry, Fosnaugh said. 

On Sunday, March 10, police 
on patrol discovered tnat a 
heavy-gauge wire security win- 
dow screen had been cut at a 



Electrical Engineering Building, 

cessing units, a keyboard and 
mouse, valued at an estimaled 
S7,01&gt;0, had been stolen. 

The cut out portion of the 
screen was found lying in 
shrubbery outside the second 
window south of the entrance

Rusted Root makes modern music with timeless tradition 



Photo courtesy of Island Records 



By Joruh Cnsmore. Features Edilor 

Ader spending some time away from 
the studio, (he eclectic band Rusted Root 
has cotne back in full farce with the release 
of 'Welcome to Mj- Party." 

"During my year off, I spent a lot of 
time drinking, dnnking and writing," 
Michael Glabicki. vocalist, said. He added 
thai it was inevitable that Rusted Root 
would n^tutn to the studio. 

Most of the wTiliiig that Glabicki com- 
pleted in his time off was for himsel/. He 
composed songs for himself, not realizing 
at (he time that those songs would become 
the roots of Ihe band's new cd. 

Each member, an accomplished musi- 
cian in his own right, kept his respective 
musical abilities in check with various solo 
projects, Jcnn Wert7, guitars and percus- 
sion, was gone from the band (or five 
years, and after spending lime with 
Glabicki, decided it would be besi to 
regroup R us led Root 

"I had spent a tot of time with 
Michael," Wertz said, " I was interested in 
his new stuff and how it would sound with 



tfie whole group." 

Once pack in the studio, tfie band 
used a variety of ii«tru(nents. many which 
likely have not been heard previously by 
Rusted Root lis tenets. 

"John Buynak went crazy on the elec- 
tric guitars.' Glabicki said. "He just pul 
them throurfi all of these weird pedals. 
kind of like Stevie Wander," 

Another aspect of recording 
"Welcome to My Parly" that was different 
from other Rusted Root albums was the 
presence of a digitalized rhytJimic section, 
such as the one present on the "People of 
My Village" tract. 

"My favorite track to perform live is 
probably 'Blue Diamonds, It is a ballad 
that hits vou. There is a lot of depth to that 
song," Wertz said, 

"Blue Diamonds." pertains to an inci- 
dent from Glabicki's past. 

"When I was two and a half years old, 
I was hit by a car, and in my unconscious- 
ness, I met ttiis sort of being and she's been 
with me ever since. We'd sort of have that 
kind of deal where she's gomg lo stick 
around. It's kind of a love song about thai. 



A love song at&gt;out an angel,' Glabicki said. 

With such interesting stories lo inspire 
equally interesting songs, the members of 
Rusted Root said thai Ihey Rnd it hamd to 
describe the kind of music they make. 

Glabicki said. 'Us our music. It is 
hard ID categorize because it is our vibe 
that sets the lone for the vibe of the music." ■ 

Currently, Rusted Root said they see 
the music industry' as being very fragment- 
ed. However, thai does not mean thai thcv 
do not bebeve tfial the music industry iviil 
eventually change. 

"Every couple of. years, there is a tide 
in music," \Strtz said. 'l think ive are com- 
ing close lo a new musical tide because 
there IS |U5t so much out there. There are so 
many great acts as well as some stuff that is 
just fluff." 

Whatever the case, the members of 
Rusted Root said that they hope to be at the 
crest of Ihe new musical lidal wave thai 
they believe wilt wash over Ihe music 
industry in the near future. 

Rusled Root currently plans lo tour 
extensively in the spring and throughout 
the summer. 



Leprakanapolooza brings diverse music to Fort Wayne 



By Rence Thompson, Spec 
Sectioi - ■■■ 



lEditc 



Lcprakanapolooi^a: crazy 
rock bands from around the 
slate all playing in one location. 
Last Saturday, March 16, the Art 
Factory, located at 340 E, Berry 
Slreel, held the first annual St. 
Patrick's Day concert. 
Appronimately 12 local bands 
gathered in the unique down- 
tovjn building and rocked into 
the early morning hours. 

After being made several 
false promises by local club 
owners, Diane Ctocncrl decided 
to buy the Arl Factory and 
began renting il out as studio 
space. After a while. Groenerl 
realized that the laclory would 
be an opportune place for an all- 
ages duD and a place for local 
bands to perform, 

Ibdd Hamm (Conunurvicalar 
ivnvs editor] and I aiiived cm loca- 
tion at 7-30. a UlUe after tfie second 
band began hit the stage. 



Entrance admission was five 
dollars and since we were there 
rather early, we were able lo get 
closer to the bands Ihan those 
who arrived later. 

The firs I band we heard 
was Utile lonny Hugo. Tliey 
were really good, but sounded a 
little on the generic side. They 
played for an hour and by Ihe 
time the third band was ready to 



Jaded from Michigan who pei 
formed with the test of them. 
Their music was power pop and 
sounded similar to Blinfc-182. 

After Ihe third band's set, I 
had a chance lo look around and 
took note o( the different types 
of people who were in atten- 
dance. Needless to say, there 
was quite a mix present. 

Some audience members 
were wearing pleather, shiny 
pants with their hair leased out 
about two-feet from their scalps 
while others were wearing 



turlleneck sweaters with Gap 
baseball caps. 

The fourth band, South Bay 
Bessie, was more along my lines 
They played harder rock music 
that, of course, started the peo- 
ple moshing and slam dancing. 
At this time I moved a little clos- 
er lo Todd for feat of being 
pushed into Ihe clasfiing crowd! 

Once South Bay Bessie 
ended, a somewhat more eclec- 
tic band. The Sods, was there 10 
take their place. 

Even though half their 
band members were missing, 
the remaining three — Jonah 
Crismore, Jeremy Roberts and 
Bart Helms— still managed to 
get the crowd going wilh their 
Irish folk punk. 

We took off alter The Sods 
played. I'm told that the bands 
kept playing until 1;3Q a.m. 




Timeless poetry powerful in beauty, relevancy 



By Jennilei Huntley. Staff Writer 

Poet Yevgeny Ycvtushenko 
will be ptescniing "The Best of 
the Best in Walb Student Union 
on Friday, March 22, 

Much of the Russian poet's 
kvork has been translated into 
English. "From Desire to Desire," 
a book of love poems, provides a 
somewhat different 'feel from ihc 
traditional American view of love 
poems. This is not a collecb'on of 
mushy, sickeningly sweet verses 
o( admiration, nor is it a group of 
depressing lines of woe. 

Instead, Yevtushcnko takes a 
much differani approach lo writ- 
ing love poetry. He writes of Ihe 
disillusionment of youth as part 
of the discovery process in love 
and life. He ivrites of belonging 
lo one \voman ivhile trying to 
make himself belong to others. 
He compares love to a fire: il 
starts as a raging flame and ends 
in a pile of burnt out ash. 

In this collection of love 
poems, he gives many views of 
love from Ihegood times of youth- 



ful illusions lo the heartbreaking 
times as death looms near. 

The most surprising aspect 
about Yevtushenko's work is that 
it translated into English so elo- 
quently There was little or no 
cultural confusion within the 
poems, as is often the case when 
reading work from other places 
and times. There was an absence 
of the awkwardness commonly 
present in many translated 
works. Although many of Ihe 
poems were written many years 
ago, they still had relevancy. 

Yevlushenko's poelry has 
the timeless quality of being true 
without pomp or circumstance, II 
is not sugar-coated or falsified. II

.1. per- 



haps throughout time. There 
very few lilerary works that can 
remove themselves from time 
and space as beautifully as this 
collection of poems has done 

For a personal tasic of 
Yevhjshenko's works, join him as 
he presents at the the Omnibus 
lecture series on Friday, March 22.

Big dance delivers madness as usual 



By Andrew Howard, Sports Editor 

Well, how sweet il is. March Madness is 
up and rolling already with two rounds of 
etcitemeni, surprises and downright disap- 
pointments. 

Before the loumamenl began there 

were many questions to be answered. 

Would Conzaga overcome the injushce of 

such a low seed for the 

sixth ranked team in 

the season? Would 

Cincinnati prove 

^MARCH ^^ "hai they 

giver 

coached team actually make it out of the 
first round? 

Well, the results are in and il is a 
resounding no. much lo the frustration of 
many with Iheir own brackets in complete 
shambles (including yours truly). 

But wait! Would Indiana, without 
Knight, actually surpass the first round? 
Would the selection committee's new 
attempts lo keep teams closer lo their own 
regions provide an unfair advantage lo many 
iL-ams blessed with a quasi-home game? But 

And would you expect anything less 
(lom the month of March? ll's what makes the 
madness so mad . 

But the sweet sixteen is sel and with it 
comes an array of interesting malch ups. 

The game most likelv to draw the alten- 
tion of local Hoosiers is ODviously when Iheir

remains to be seen whelhcr Duke s lack of 
depth iviU hurt tlxan fudlier into the loumamcnt. 

1 e\r'ect Duke lo match up nexl with 
Pittsburgh, who should dispose of Ken! State 
fairly easily. 

The UCLA versus Missouri game ma^- 
win as the most intriguing game of the round. 
Here is a ^me that might Ijcller be referred to 
as the clash of the inconsistents. Both teams 
started Iheseasonoutstrongandm the lop 10. 
However, both teams seem to lose all momen- 
tum as soon as they gnin it. 

Full ot laleni and potential, either o( 
tliese teams could compete (vith and beal any 
learn in the tournament. I-ook (or Missouri, 
who is finally showmg some elfort and some 
help for Kareem Rush, to carry their fairy tale 
into the Elite Eight. 

Shall Missouri prevail. Ihey should 
expect to face up against Arizona, who will 
squeak out a dose win over two seeded 
Oklahoma. Many felt the Sooneis deserved 
the number Dtie seed Ihal was taken by 
Cincinnati and in hindsight, maybe they prol&gt; 
ably did. However, this game will be ivon by 
the excellent coaching of Lute Olsen, who has 
already taken his very young team where no
