Faculty, students express concerns 



By Paul Tupper, SUfT WriUr 
and Krlvlle Rlccl Schlundl, 
Edllnr in Chief 

Several IPPW studenis and fac- 
ulty mcinbcts arc questioning the 
job performance of Gerald RaUiff, 
dean of Ihe School of Fine and 
Performing Ans, 

Louise Rodcnbcck. a senior in 
fine arif, mainlains Ihal Ratliff is 
not able to fairly and responsibly 
run the School of Fine and 
Performing Art.s. She alleges ibai 
(he dean removed "inspiralional 
posters" from Ihe fine ans building, 
verbally ailackcO faculty in the 
presence of students and favored 
Ihe theater department over the 
music and fine ans deparunenls in 
liie budget allocation. 

"Railiff's job is to unify and 
make the faculty more productive," 
Rodcnbcck said. 

Les Moiz, fine arts dcparuncnl 
chair, credited Ratliff for "getting 
things done." 

Moi'/. added, "He did more in 



one year than the previous dean did 
in five years. He got things done, 
but he caused ill-feelings, destroyed 
Ihe morale of the faculty." 

"Faculty have shared some of 
Ihcir displeasure with sludenis. It's 
inappropriate to lake internal mis- 
understandings 10 studenis. ..it's 
using students basically as pawns," 
Motz said. 

Moiz stated thai communication 
difficulties and general misunder- 
standings arc a part of the problem. 

"He came from a unionized col- 
lege where ibey had a policy or a 
rule for everything. He refers to his 
manual (from Moniclair Slate 
University! and decides thai things 
should be done according lo the 
guidelines in ihai caialog...bui this 
is IPFW, and those policies won't 
always work here." Moiz slated. 

Moiz added thai he has taken his 
concerns lo ihe university adminis- 
tration, "but I have always gone to 
him first before I look anything 
over to KetUer Hall." 

Ratliff said that he indeed 



circulated a memo to all fine and 
performing arts faculty requesting 
Ihal they remove items thai had 
been "pasted lo ihc walls, some of 
ihem with packing-iype tape," 

Many of the faculty complied, 
Ralliff said, and when others did 
not, he made requests lo building 
maintenance to remove the items 
from Ihe walls. 

Railiff added that he personally 
removed nothing from the walls, 

"In trying to forward our pro- 
grams, I've made mistakes. I freely 
admit ihaC Radiff commented. 

He added. "We have to have fac- 
ulty and staJ'f maintain higher stan- 
dards. What I've offered have been 
guidelines more than policies. ..I've 
encouraged honest and open com- 
munication while abiding by ihc 
rules." 

Ralliff also said he believes ihat 
much of Ihe rancor in fine arts is 
due to Ihe move from Dcrry Street 
onto the campus. "On Berry SirccI, 
die dcpnrlmenl was unrestricted and 
unsupervised. There was no Ibbili- 



IPSGA to replace 
Campus Calendar 



Dy KrlsUeKlcclSchlundt 
Editor in Chief 

At Ihe recent meeting of the 
student senate. Student Body 
President Mark King told the 
senate why he had decided to 
cancel the Campus Calendar. 

King said that he plans to 
replace the paid advertisement in 
The Communicator with a voice 
mailbox system. Studenis would 
be able lo access campus events 
scheduling information by 
phone. 

He was acting on the recom- 
mendation of die IPFW mirkei- 
ing association, he said. 

Dean of Sludenis Marian 
Zimmerman, who serves as an 
adviser lo IPSGA said that she 
and Vice Chancellor of Student 



Affairs Frank Borelli had recom- 
mended that IPSGA continue to 
run Campus Calendar in The 
Communicator. 

"It is so difficult 10 get infor- 
mation out to Ihe students." 
Zimmerman said. 

"In addition to the new voice 
mailboxes, we can mail a month- 
ly campus calendar to the stu- 
dents," King suggested. 

"It will cost approximaiely 
SlOO 10 implemeni and S30-S50 
a month to maintain it," King 
said. 

He added that other depart- 
ments.and organizations would be 
able to "camp on" to the system 
al no additional cost lo IPSGA. 

King said that IPSGA should 
plan to promote ihe system with 
banners across campus. 



"At no time have I taken over 
as a monarch; ibis is not parlia- 
menl." King commented. 

For the Good of the Order, 
Senators Cecil Baker, Chris 
Douse and Jeff Valdez comment- 
ed on King's previous decision lo 
cancel Campus Calendar without 
consulting the Senate. 

Douse commented Ihal King 
should consult the senate before 
making any decision that directly 
affects the students. 

"Mark has to go through the 
senate. Everything has to go 
through the Senate. We're a leam, 
and we have to work together." 
Baker said, 

Valdez said. "Mark should 
have consulted us, but we have to 
respect bis position as president. I 
guess." 



Iy..,what I do here is say they just 
can't come and go as they please." 

Regarding the allegations thai 
Ralliff favors Ihe theater depanmeni 
over music and fine arts in the bud- 
get allocation, Larry Life, theater 
department chair, said, "All faculty 
received each department's operat- 
ing budget, and theater has the 
lowest budget allocation of the 



three — which is proper, because we 
have the lowest enrollment" 

Life added that co-sponsor- 
ship with Ihe Fort Wayne Youlb 
Theater brings the theater 
department a percentage of Ihc 
box office for Youth Theater's 
Christmas play. 

"This year 1 bought plants for 
our lobby with that money," 



Life said. 

Interim Vice Chancellor for 
Academic Affairs Fred Kirchboff 
commented that pan of the con- 
struction funds for the theater 
building are now being spent on 
new equipment, which could give 
students the false impression that 
extra funds have been extended to 
the theater department. 



Indiana Commission for Higher Education 

University budgets proposed 



By S. Brant Kelley 
News Editor 

The Indiana Commission for 
Higher Education (ICHE) held a 
meeting on Friday, Sept. 9. to hear 
1995-97 university budget requests. 

The Slate will hold a budget 
debate in October and will vote in 
November, Commissioner Clyde 
Ingle said. 

Capital and operating budget 
requests for die next two academic 
years were made by Indiana's seven 
state universities: Indiana 
University, Purdue University, 
Indiana Stale University, Ball State 
University, Southern Indiana 
University, Vincennes Junior 
College and Ivy Tech Stale College. 

'Ilie schools requested a seven 
percent increase, on average, in 
overall funding for the 1995-96 and 
1996-97 school years, said Ingle. 
That works out to aboul S244 md- 
lion over die next two years. Ingle 
said the budget for Ihe 1995-96 year 
would be about Sl.l billion for the 
1995-96 school year, and SI. 2 for 
1996-97. up from SI billion Qiis 
year. 

Each school made requests 
which were slightly larger than he 
expected, said Ingle. 

Ingle said a one percent increase 
for quality improvement was 
requested. That would amount lo 
S16.7 million for die first year and 
S34 million for die second year. 

In exchange for full funding, Ihc 
schools agreed to keep tuition and 
fee increases down to four percent, 
which is about the rale of inflation. 



said Ingle. 

IPFW Chancellor Michael 
Wariell said the quality improve- 
ment money allocated lo IPFW 
would probably be used to hire 
more full-time faculty al this 
campus. 

Additional money was requested 
by Indiana's state universities for 
servicing debt on buildings, mainte- 
nance and increased student finan- 
cial aid. 

IPFW has requested funds for 



a new science building. Wartell said 
he doesn't imow if the campus will 
reteive Ibe money, bul he believes 
that "good argumcnis" have been 
made for it. 

Wariell said he thought (he 
requests made by die univcrsilics 
were reasonable. In fact, he said, "I 
diink diere's a good chance, since 
it's such a reasonable proposal, ihat 
die legislature will act favorably 
upon it," 



Gerontology certificate 
now offered at IPFW 



By Kara Whiting 
Features Editor 

A new certificate program is 
available to both graduates and 
undergraduates at IPFW. The 
department of psychological sci- 
ences recently developed a geron- 
tology certificate program as pan of 
the department's curriculum. 

Gerontology is ihe study of the 
aging process and die ceriificate 
program could be a great asset lo 
anyone, according to program 
director Associate Professor of 
Psychology Elaine Blakemwe. 

Blakemore stated the gerontol- 
ogy ceriificate can be applied lo 
many areas of academic study, such 
as general studies, sociology, psy- 
chology, audiology, communica- 
dons and any of the health care 



professions. 

The program itself requires suj- 
dcnLs to complete 18 credit houi^, 

So far, it has only attracted about 
12 Sludenis. Blakemore said she 
hopes the program will draw more 
interest in the future. 

Blakemore said great emphasis 
is placed on individualization in 
diis program. "I talk individually 
wilh each person to sec which 
practicum is most suitable for ibein 
in the area," she said. 

Anyone who would like more 
informauon on bow to earn a cer- 
tificate in gerontology can contact 
the department of psychological 
sciences at 481-6403.

latest thwarted effon to address

In a re-writlcn Tinal version of 
the letter which the loumal-Ga/ettc

Satire 

Marlboro man laments smoker's 

rights to light up anywhere 

By Tim Wenthe 
Cueft Writer 



Smack! Smackl resounds the 
atmosphere as 1 emphatically pack 
my cigarettes against the palm of 
my hand, filling the outdoor portico 
with small, pronounced claps of 
artificial applause. With my flint 
flame (i.e., ligh.er with the 
Marlboro insignia stenciled in and 
throughout the celluloid) cupped in 
my right band. I rise my left and 
place a white cylinder (i e.. ciga- 
rette) into my yawning maw. 
Kissing the as-of-yet immaculate 
cotton butt, I kick open the door 
with much the same violence as 
though I were (p.s. I am) a vigilante 
fervent for a cause, whatever the 
case may be, be that as it may, 
whatever the cause is, that is, my 
cause being at this moment ar^in of 
the mellow, ?. arson of the mellow 
son?, you'll soon see. Stepping into 
the still air of the tepid and shel- 
tered vestibule with the pompous 
aplomb of ibe legendary Marlboro 
Man, of whom I believe myself to 
be, schizophrenzic though I am, I 
raise the inflamed faggot to the pro- 
tniding circular surplus of pulpy 
paper, an excess of paper resultant 
from the my emphatic packing, let 
there be no doubt concerning that. 
and a conflagration flares forth at 
this furthermost tip of the cigarette 
as the flini flame ignites my smoke; 
an area, as I mentioned earlier, 
made prcraineot by my prooounced 
packing. The burning p^ier engulfs 
and flecking tobacco, instanta- 
neously berthing forth into fiery 
spack of what is vernacularly 
known as chcny, cbeiry being jar- 
gon, perhaps a neologism for smol- 
dering flecks of u&gt;bacco, not doubt, 
or slang for tbe same image, slang 
being different from jargon. How? 



Don't know. Nuance in our lan- 
guage, no doubt. I can't say that 
I'm rightly confident as tbe origin 
of the concept of cherry, the con- 
cept of cherry, that is. being that of 
a cigarette butt burning. Onward. I 
inhale deep, letting tbe tar and nico- 
tine soot my lungs into a sable veil, 
much like that of mold on cheese, 
I'm coining an image here, so tear 
with me. ..like I said, mold on 
cheese just internal and organic, not 
external and atmospheric like 
cheese somatic mold, soma being 
Greek for body, attic being self evi- 
dent, being that place above our 
beads in our homes where the mold 
often grows, at least in urban bous- 
ing., houses in which tbe attics are 
tepid and moldy with wet wigs or 
other such items of decorum. 
Anyway. So tbe mold, nicotine 
mold, that is, coats the bairs of my 
lungs and a buzz ensues, metatasiz- 
ing throughout my essence, whim- 
sically, of course. So I laugh sar- 
donically, my laughter almost 
sadistic, needless to say. or so I said 
anyway. Sardonic. Isn't that (i.e. 
sardonicism) like sour or some- 
thing, almost an indigesdble bitter- 
ness, like when one eais dehydrated 
legumes and finds oneself bloated 
with miasma? Yes, indeed, my 
good reader, Bullseye! Onward, I 
feel a satiating satisfaction, which 
manifests itself, or has already man- 
ifested itself, as the aforemestioned 
sardonic laughter of which 1 spoke. 
1 feel satisfied. Satiated, as though I 
just ate a can of hydraied Icgimies 
seasoned with brown sauce of seme 
sort I fell a full, fat satisfactioo as 
spirals of dancing smoke dash to 
meet your hairy, tweezer-twcakcd 
DO&amp;trils; you wlKxn so adamandy 



detest of my passivity! 1 wage war 
on you with t&gt;elligerent belches of 
smoke and passive streamers of 
blue malignance. Plumes of wrath 
exhaled from my mein, my mouth, 
my flaming nostrils, un-tweaked 
nostrils-no tweezer in my trousers- 
rapidly evanesce Uke vapor into the 
air of the edifice, dissipating forth 
to pollute your pink cheese. If you 
haven't guessed it by now, which 
perhaps you have not, very likely, 
in fact, 1 am smoking in tbc foyer, 
or vestibule, for tbe purposes of my 
anecdote these lexical items are 
synonymous. You foyer, my friend, 
this very building's foyer. Tbe very 
same foyer in which you so exas- 
peratedly inhaled deep after having 
kept your breath in. Just like pearl 
diver off the coast of some tropical 
paradise, your lungs sDaining your 
lungs a finiie reservoir of precious 
oxygen as you walked, priggishly, 
through tbe pavilion, nose high. 
high and squeamish, onward 
through the paiio, tbe cement curbs, 
where smokos sit letting tbeir pas- 
sivity fart freely. Too late, my 
smokeless friend, for my flauileitce 
has already seeped into the air 
ducu. soon it shall saturate this col- 
legiate edifice, into each and every 
classroom, custodial closet, latrine, 
both mens and women's, every- 
wtere, every atom of atmosphere, 
or is it molecule? Together, me and 
my closest chum. Asbestos, shall 
spell your demise! Tbai is, of 
course, unless you lift die ban on 
smoking in the cafeteria of Walb 
Union, then my passivity shall be of 
no concern to you. unless you seek 
mc out there, in which case we can 
shake hands and share a spittoon!

Commentary 

By Ramona Mcgown 
Managing Edilor 

Recently, a proressor asked a 
clauroom full of siudcnLs why they 
thoughi African Americans com- 
plain aN)ut the current coverage of 
black ivsuei in newspapers uxlay. 

[ personally feel ibat il is very 
obvious why African Americans 
complain aboui ihe media in gencr- 
aJ. 

Unroriunately, when African 
Americans are mentioned in the 
newspaper, it is in a negative light. 
African -Am eric an neighborhoods 
are described as crime-ridden. 
Undoubtedly, the readers become 
fearful of those communities that 
are said to have an abundant 
amount of crime. Through this 
method, the terms "African 
American." "gheilo." and "urban 



crime" are used to infer that blacks 
are somehow n:sponsiblc for the ills 
of the entire world, however false 
or mulcading This is reality. 

Some might suggest that I am 
coming from an African -American 
perspective. With all due respect, 
aren't those who are in top manage- 
ment positions in the media coming 
from a predominately white, male 
perspective? 

Has anyone really taken a look 
at who is running die newspapers 
today? All one has to do is look 
who makes up the editorial boards 
of most major newspapers. 

Another professor even suggest- 
ed that newspapers were fair and 
consciously show both sides of a 
story. 



In reality, newspapers tend to be 
very politically connected and 
CKircmely money driven. The say- 
ing "money talks and bullshit 
walks" IS painfully clear. 

In journalism, we are supposed 
to have ethics and a sense of fair- 
ness. 

Where is the fairness in report- 
ing most crimes which occur in the 
south areas of Fort Wayne? Is one 
to assume that the same crimes are 
not occurring in the north and west 
parLs of town, as well as the sur- 
rounding townships? Crime reports 
show differently. 

Let's look at the McLaughlin 
Group which appears on PBS every 
Sunday. Here are a bunch of upper 
class, white persons who arc shar- 



ing their political views on world 
issues. Can Ihey relate to the aver- 
age white or black American? They 
live in their cushioned suburban 
homes with secure incomes. How 
can they possibly relate to what is 
occurring in the real world? 

Il Is absurd to see those who 
^pear on Nightjine, etc. give their 
so-called "expert" views on African 
Americans. Latinos, and other 
minorities. It is my gues.s that these 
same experts do not have any real 
contact politically or socially with 
the average American. What a joke! 

The reality? What is reported in 
the media today is extremely biased 
and unfair. 

This idea can be taken one step 



further with our Congress and 
Senate. 

Here we have a group of individ- 
uals — again, a majority of white, 
upper class men — who are debating 
the national health-care issue. 
Consider this fact: Every member 
of Congress is "entitled" to partici- 
pate in the federally-funded insur- 
ance program of their choice &lt;not to 
mention the Federal Employees 
Retirement program [FRS]). 
Realistically, then, how concerned 
can these individuals be with the 
problems of the lower cla.w? Better 
question: Where do I sign up? 

I choose to title this article 
"Justice, or Should I say Just Us?" 
This simply means that, as I get 
older, 1 am learning all of my 



Utopian ideas like jusilcc. ethics, 
and fnimess really have a double 
meaning. Very few people receive 
justice or fairness vin the courts, 
media and, yes, even acadcmia. I 
am quickly coming to die rcalizA- 
lion that everything boils down to 
politics, money, and uss-kLising. If 
you play the giune well and give a 
little bit of your self-respect and 
ideab. then., .well, you'll make it. 

Even here at The 
Communicator, people-take — a 
guess — try and destroy rmyonc who 
docs not say what they want to 
hear. The saying "same shit, differ- 
ent day" seems quite the motto of 
the day. 



Letter to the Editor 

Generation X 



To the editor, 

It has come to my attention that 
my generation, the twentysome- 
Ihings, has come lo be known as 
"Generation X." From what I 
understand we have come by this 
label because we seem to be lost 
with no clear distinctive value or 
belief. We are supposedly lazy and 
good for nothing but complaining 
and blaming others for our prob- 
lems. I wish to write about this 
branding of my generation. 

I wonder if anyone else out 
there noticed the constant ba.shing 
of "Generation X" during the 
recognition of the fifth anniversary 
of the D-Day invasion. Every time 
1 sat down to watch one of the 
dozens of commentaries and 
reports on the invasion, there 
always seemed to be a constant 
.-; implication madc]...: about 
i;''Generation'J(.'' l-don'^ know bow 
many limes I beard someone'sft^' 
that they didn't believe that the 
young people of America, if neces- 
sary, could pcri'onn another D-Day 
invasion. Basically, the implication 
being made was that young 
Americans did not have the 
courage or patriotism that the 
World War II generation had. 

I have a serious problem with 
[his implication. It seemed as if the 
older generations just simply forgot 
about that little conflict we had a 
few years ago with Iraq. If I recall 
conecily, around 500,000 mostly 
"Generation X" soldiers were sent 
to a foreign land to fight yet ruiotb- 
cr questionable war. During ibis 
time. I do not recall my generation 
conducting massive desertions or 
protests. 

Now, I know you're thinking. 
You can't compare the Persian 
Gulf Wiir with D-Day, This is true, 
but, although relatively few 
Americins died in the Persian Gulf, 
il certainly was not predicted to end 
with that n:sult. Before the actual 
fighting started, tbe threat of chem- 
ical warf.ire was lingering in the air 
and casualties were being estimated 
in the thousands. Yet "Generation 
X" did not run and hide as older 
generations would like you to think 



would happen. 

I think it is also important to 
point out that it l^es a great deal 
more to be a patriotic American 
today than it did during the World 
War II era. The D-Day soldier was 
mainly a white male, deprived of 
the true history of his country, and 
spoon fed the theory of "apple pie 
and the American way." There was 
no TV to bring you live coverage 
of combat, or a we II -documented 
Viemam War to show how bad pol- 
itics can get you killed. I certainly 
do not mean to take away from the 
bravery displayed or ihe accom- 
plishments made on D-Day. My 
point is . "Generation X" had all 
this to think about and during the 
Persian Gulf War. 500.000 of us,— 
of all races and sexes, showed dieir 
courage and pairiotisni, I . ' 
'' This Ulrelates toailoihcr obser' 
vati(&gt;n I hiit'ft'Vnfldeloromer giinferaJ 
lions. For some reason they believe 
that we would be better off revert- 
ing to the values of Americans dur- 
ing die 1950s, the "golden years." 
I've heard (his preached many 
times. 

Particularly, one day while 
watching CNN, a congressman was 
addressing a banquet of fellow 
politicians. He was speaking about 
how Ihe younger people of today 
have lo.st their morals and that we 
should go back to the values we 
had during the fifties. Now here is 
a politician, a leader of our country, 
on national TV publicly stating that 
we should revert to a period of time 
in our country when il was still 
legal to discriminate against anoth- 
er man on the basis of skin color

when many of our labor laws were 
not enacted, and to a lime when 
women basically had no other 
option but lo be a housewife. In my 
opinion, there is no period of time 
in America in which we can look 
back on for guidance. We need to 
learn from our past, not live it. 

1 do believe there is some truth 
lo the criticism of my generation 
We have a tenacity for blaming 
others for our problems and then 
holding our hands out saying 
"now give me." The past of this 
country plays a great role in the 
problems we have today, but point- 
ing fingers all day long will get us 
nowhere. We are developing into a 
generation who lacks the ability to

Master of industrial gloom 


Gerontology center to open 



By JamU Ctarer 
Pealurei WriUr 

If you were lucky enough (o 
caich la-sl week's review, then you 
should know thai I was in ailcn- 
dancc Uiis pa^l .Saturday nighi foe 
Ibe Nine Inch Nails conccn at Ball 
Slate. 

The concert had been sold out 
for 3 couple wcck.s. and small packs 
of unlucky fans without tickets hud- 
dled together on the outside front 
steps to at least catch the sounds of 
Ibe ongoing concert, if not the 
sights. 

The concen opened up with a 
short set by the hard-core-on-thc- 
fringcs-of-psychotic band Marilyn 
Manson who's latest album is a 
release off of Trent Rcznor's own 
record bbcl "Nodiing Records." 

Marilyn Manson was then fol- 
lowed by the strange and unusual 
Jim Rose Circus Sideshow which 
some may remember from 
Lollapaloo/a a couple years back. 
Everything from a bald tattooed 
inan lighting a cigarette while being 
torched in the face to a man who 
lifts heavy objects held by two 
ropes attached to his nipple rings 
was displayed by this original cast 
of wcirdocs. 

Then just as it was time for Nine 
Inch Nails lo take Itie stage and ihc 
overhead lights blinked out, all hell 
broke loose. The two center aisles 
in the reserve sections filled with 
ecstatic fans that pushed past and 
jumped through the understaffed 
and bewildered security to the 
already sweaty and mosh-fillcd 
main floor which had been sold as a 
gencnd admission area. 

As all this was going on. the first 
lone, screech-like growl of a guitar 
rang through the diick. smoke-filled 



air of the tightly-packed artnia 

Trent Reznor^wbo is Nine Inch 
Nails — then appeared wearing all 
black with his unruly looking band 
and cried out the lyrics to the fitting 
"Mr. Self Dcsiruct," which is the 
first track off the highly successful 
"Downward Spiral." 

Reznor and company then ripped 
through tunes both new and old 
widi electrifying synthesized distor- 
tions and growling guitar noi.se that 
was complemented by the great 
unnatural lighting effecLs. Reznor 
roared his dark messages of depres- 
sion and abandon on "Maah of the 
Pigs," Reptile," "Big Man with a 
Gun," and '"Happiness in Slavery." 

Then Nine Inch Nails gave an 
car blistering performance of 
"Pretty Hate Machine" in which 
Reznor blindly collided with the 
band members, tumbled off the 
stage, and ripped a synthesizer from 
its cords and smashed it angrily 
against a speaker at the front of the 
stage. 

During the somewhat more laid- 
back but disturbing songs "Eraser" 
and "Hun," a Uiin sctten was pulled 
in front of the stage. During 
"Eraser." scenes of barren and deso- 
late land were shown. As the song 
picked up and beaded towards its 
climatic end. black clouds appeared 
in [lie sky and picked up speed with 
the song, and then the sky slowly 
turned black. The screen gave a 
compelling affect to the show, and 
the band members could still be 
seen through tbe screen, which 
blended tbem into the scenery at 
just the right moments. 

Apocalyptic scenes were also 
flashed up on the saeen which dis- 
played hordes of bugs and flocks of 
either birds or bats so vast that the 
sky turned black. 



During the deeply depressing 
rendition of "Hun." explicit images 
of starvation, death, and decay were 
'flashed on the screen. As the song 
ended, there was a moment of eerie 
silence as a decayed fox overridden 
with maggots molded back together 
into a whole-yet-still-dead body. 
Also intriguing was a snake that Ibe 
film slowly reeled the concertgocrs 
into close contact with. Its cold, 
unblinking eyes were unforgettable. 

Reznor was every bit as viva- 
cious as the music — constandy run- 
ning all over the stage, knocking 
over everything in sight. 

The performance ended with the 
crowd favorite "Head Like a Hole" 
in which Reznor raised his hands to 
the frenzied crowd and proclaimed 
the popular verse "Bow down 
before the one you serve. You're 
going to get what you deserve," as 
adoring fans raised Qieir hands in 
obedience and loyalty to the master 
of industrial gloom. 

Success has not tamed or taken 
any of the raw power from Trent 
Reznor or his music. For this rea- 
son, perhaps, he did not play his 
most recent and popular song 
"Closer," 10 tbe dismay of many 
fans Reznor has always been out- 
spoken against his strong dislike of 
radio play and commercial fame 

Also slighUy disappoiniing lo 
many was the fact that Nine Inch 
Nails only performed for seventy- 
five minutes with no encore perfor- 
mance. 

But these were small disappoint- 
ments, as everyone who left seemed 
satisfied by what was a seventy-five 
minute performance of raw energy 
wired by the unique and unsettling 
Treni Reznor. If given die chance, 
this was a must-see performance. 
So, 'til next week....

It is inevitable that one day we 
will all experience the burden of 
aching joints, learn hair styling lips 
for gray and thinning hair, and 
maybe even tell our grandchildren 
that in our day such rebellion would 
not have been tolerated. But despite 
the obvious and permanent alter- 
ations, die rite of passage from mid 
life to the golden years has entered 
a metamorphosis. 

Over the last century, modern 
technology and medicine have 
made it possible for humans to live 
longer and healthier. Five years ago, 
according to the U.S. Bureau of the 
Census, the population of adults 
over 65 accounted for 10.3 percent 
of the population. Now citizens 
over 65 represent an estimated 17 
percent of Americans, 

As a result, more senior citizens 
are seizing the day. Increased 
enrollment in posl-sccondary educa- 
tion establishments has created the 
demand for colleges and universi- 
ties to consider and accommodate 
the older student population. 



The committee has created an IS 
credit certificate in gerontology, the 
study of aging and the aged. Crcm 
G23I: Introduction to Gerontology, 
the only required course for the cer- 
tificate, was listed in the Schedule 
of Classes this semester. Unique in 
its structure, the class is Liught by 
six professors and covers several 
a.spccLs of aging, including psycho- 
logical, biological, philosophical, 
sociological, as well as the benefits 
of musical therapy for the aged. 

According to William Bruening, 
professor of philosophy, 
the class is dicmalic and, as a result, 



students have taken a greater inter- 
est. 

"Some of the folks in there ivally 
want to get involved." said 
Bruening. 

The advancements in learning 
and aiding the community nuiy not 
stop here. A proposal to obtain part 
of IPFW propcny in order to build a 
Gerontology Center has been sub- 
mitted by the committee. Po.ssible 
uses for the center include a loca- 
tion for agencies and services for 
older adults and also a place for 
training gerontological students.

Q: If you accidentally bite 
the inside of your cheek, 
or if your gums bleed 
when brushing your 
teeth, and you engage In 
oral sex, are you at risk of 
contraaing HIV? 

A. Yes. If you have bleeding 
gufns, cuts, or an open sore 
in the mouth, taking semen 
mio the mouth from an HIV- 
infected man can put you at 
risk. Performmg oral sex on 
a woman has less, but still 
some, risk. Using a condom 
or dental dam would reduce 
that risk.

—Monday nighl football observer. 

Dear Observer Good QucstionI Five yean ago, the answer was clear. 
Madden by q good 40 lo 50 pounds, Yci over the lost five years, Summcrall has 
really beefed up. It's siill Madden, however, by only a few rolls. 

Dear Q and A: Who's going lowin the Superbowlin '95? 

—IPFW sludenl. 
Dear iludeni: That's a tough question. I'm going to slick with my pre-ses' 
(on prediction. Da Bcccan. Of course, my selection, you must undeisland, will 
only come to pass if my olbcr prediction comes true. This obviously being that the 
rest of the league will mysteriously contract a crippling and physically debdilating 
disease thai will wipe oul most of the 'good' 
players. 

Dear Q and A: Who 's going to win Bud Bowl V? 

-IPFW dropoul-

sacrifice a better lasting Dud Lite O' enjoy a great tasting beer and risk 
getting that bloated feeling. 



Dear QandA: How ai 



' Ihe Indianapolis Colls going to do thii year? 

—IPFW student 



Dear student: l\it Colts don't look half bad Ihis year. They blew oul Itie 
Oilen in their opener. andMarsball Faulk looks grcal Buiif history repeals \\s£M. 
which it often does, ibc Colts will soon be silling helplessly al the bottom of iheu 
division. One of the reasons why is firsl-round draft pick Marshall Faulk. He looks 
like a iavior now, but bow much good is he going to do when he's sipping apple- 
lauce through a straw at the Indianapolis Hospital? 11 sectns to be on epidemic with 
the Colts. The lost three fit^t-tound draft picks the Colts have obtained through Ihe 
years have all been injured and none have lasted a full year. Sorry Colts fans.
