SAB warns 
potential vandals 




Fridh 



Gounaris 



by S. Brant Kelley 
News Editor 

Student 
organization 
posters have 
long been disap- 
pearing from 
IPFW campus 
bulletin boards 
and some orga- 
nizations are 
getting lough on 
the perpetrators. 
"SAB 
and student government tend to put things oul there for 
advertisement of events," Director of Interior and 
Exlerior Affairs George Gounaris said "And they're 
having theft and vandalism of the materials they stick 
oul Ihere. 

"We've put lags on (the boards) saying that if ihe 
person is caught vandalizing or stealing (he items, they 
can be prosecuted; they will be," Gounaris added. 
"Charges will be fded against them for ihcfi if caught 
stealing ihe materials put out there by the Sludent 
Activities Board." 

The notice is on the top, right-hand comer of each 
board Bul iheft isn't SAB's only problem; many stu- 
dent organizations are posting their flyers over SAB 
advertisements. 

"It's the same thing with the vandalism," Gounaris 
said "People are putting their own little flyers over the 
boards. From now on, SAB is monitoring them; if they 
(SAB) pull ... one of their advertising boards out there 
and it has people's flyers stuck to it, those organiza- 
tions those flyers belong lo are going to be contacted 



by our lawyer, letting them know they have vandalized 
school property." 

SAB's revised policy concerning protection of its 
advertising properly stems from constant disappear- 
ance of their boards 

"It's just continuous ... To ihe poini ihat every year 
ihe Activities' money gels cut. so every year the 
Activities have less money lo spend on advertising 
material But when it keeps gelling stolen, we pur- 
chase more and more, and with funds being cut and 
cut, there's less and less to purchase more and more 
with. 

"It doesn't mailer whether il costs a dime or it costs 
ten dollars, they are stealing school property, vandaliz- 
ing or stealing school property," Gounaris said. 

President of Student Activities Erin Fridh deals 
direcdy with the Learning Resources Center whenever 
boards are needed. Each lime SAB needs new replace- 
ment boards, she must put in an order with the LRC. 

"Already this semester we had LRC print up six 
new boards, and we only have two left," Fridh said. 
"They're disappearing rather quick, so we'll have lo 
talk to LRC about printing up more and however long 
it takes to print them, we can't use the boards to adver- 
tise." 

Fridh said she hasn't registered an official com- 
plaint with any university authorities about the contin- 
ual disappearance of the boards. 

"I haven't contacted anyone personally," Fridh said. 
"I know thai we tried ... just getting more boards and 
trying to put tags on them saying 'Please leave them 
alone, they are school property ' We figured that might 
... draw people away from taking them, but it hasn't. 

"The campus police wander about the campus and 
can't just keep an eye on our boards "

Freedom of press ignored by culprit 



If you are a frequent visitor of the Gates 
Athletic Center, you may have noticed a lack of 
copies of last week's The Communicaior from 
the siand in the foyer. We have a paid staff 
member who distributes the papers to the stands 
located throughout the campus, and he insists be 
placed the usual number of copies in the Gates 
building. But if you iried to locate a copy of last 
week's issue, you were out of luck because 
someone decided to remove them from the 
stands. In fact, we know of two incidents in 
which ihe entire slack of papers was found in a 
trash can. 



We had to ask ourselves. "Who would do 
such a thing?" Knowing the issues placed in all 
of the other buildings were left for the siudents 
10 read, we guessed it had 10 be someone who is 
housed in ihe Gales building. Some have 
assumed the culprit may be associated with 
men's basketball. Although The Communicator 
did feature a column by Sports Editor Jim Poner 
which criticized the men's basketball coach, we 
believe most sports fans are above such reac- 
tions. A reader may just as well have been 
offended by the satire on the presidential candi- 
dates in the features section, we do not know. 



We do know we live in a socieiy in which we 
are guaranteed certain rights. When even one of 
those rights is violated or denied, society as a 
whole suffers. 

If Ihe press loses its freedom to speak freely, 
one must wonder which institution will lose that 
right nexu 

We do have some words of wisdom for those 
who have been criticized by the media— Once 
P.T. Bamum was attacked by the press and 
when he was told about it he said, "Did they 
spell my name right?" 



Commentary 



Dear movie-makers: 




gonna show it, show it all 



I recently saw a rented version 
of the controversial film "Priest," 
which is about a gay priest who 
hides his sexuality, while condon- 
ing the affair of a colleague and 
struggling with the conditions of 
his employment. 1 admit, 1 was 
intrigued by the controversy sur- 
rounding the film, but I walked 
away bewildered. 

The hubbub centered around so- 
called "explicit" sex scenes 
between the gay priest and a man 
be met in a bar. I'm sorry, but I just 



don't get it. I 
don't think 
nudity makes a 
sex scene sexy, 
but this scene 
contained no 
nudity. Since 
when does an 
explicit movie 
not contain 
nudity? Those 
who protested 
the movie did 
so because of 
the passion the 
characters showed toward each 
other, not the explicity. Because 
two men kissed with the same inti- 
macy as a heterosexual couple, the 
movie was branded "homoerotic " 

This is the same double standard 
that allows the vagina to be shown 
but not toe penis. Sex scenes are 
tolerated only if they involve a 
straight couple and do not show the 
male organ (but the entire female 
body expresses the film's artistic 
value). I want to know what harm 



can come from showing a penis in a 
movie? If a director thinks nudity is 
necessary to get a point across, why 
would tits make that point but not a 
dick? 

I think the real issue is comfort. 
Film makers are uncomfortable 
showing a man's penis, probably 
because of insecurities about the 
size of their own members. 
Regarding gay sex scenes, film 
makers are simply uncomfortable 
showing gay sex accurately. Maybe 
they think the viewing public is not 
ready to accept that gay male sex 
does not involve gerbils. In any 
case, the double standard is unnec- 
essary and unfair. 

Showing a gay man looking 
longingly into another man's eyes 
is not enough. If Elizabeth Berkley 
can show it all, why can't Scott 
Wolf? I can personally name a 
dozen gay men who went to see 
"White Squall," with the hopes of 
seeing some sailors in the buff, 
only to be disappointed. Before you 
criticize, find me the heterosexual 



men who went to see "Showgirls" 
for the beautiful scenery or the 
quality writing. 

The movie industry should see 
the potential profits from catering 
to the sexual desires of gay men... 
advertisers have. Knowing sex 
sells, Calvin Klein ads are designed 
with^the gay man in mmd. so are 
Levi commercials. Why else would 
both of these companies try to sell 
clothing featuring half-naked tor 
sometimes more) men, to make the 
buyer believe he would look like 
the tight models used in the ads? I 
don't think so. 

If the movie industry feels the 
need to show nudity, and I person- 
ally don't mind if they do, then 
let's be realistic about it. Only 
show nude scenes that are relevant 
and make sense. If two people are 
going at it, chances are they are 
both naked. 

Maybe there will be a director's 
cut video version of "White 
Squall."

Wu's argument is over simplistic, 
but this is what I have come up 
with. 

First of all, let me say that I am 
unequivocally against the violations

or worse yet, some poor tittle 
Chinese child not much older than 
she, might have been chained to an 
American or European intemation-

Clinton soft 
on Cuba 




S. Brant 

Kelley 



Our fine president has dis- 
played, once again, the glaring lack 
of spine which has characterized 
every area of his tenure except one; 
the federal budget. 

Bill Clinton's 

condemnation of 
Cuba's actions 
last weekend fell 
far short of neces- 
sary action; as I 
write. Fidel 
Castro is probably 
laughing all Ihe 
way to his bunker.

wants (he public to believe. I'm not 

sure whal to think about this, but I 

don't think il is outlandish. 

Whatever the reason, more 
unproven economic sanctions are 
not "the nght thing at this time," as 
he said. 

Why can'( he show some inter- 
national leadership and, now that 
the present circumstances are fairly 
entrenched, promise for the future 
mihiary retaliation for unwarranted 
action against U.S. citizens? 

Until this nation demonstrates 
that harm to our citizens will 
require a price, their lives will be 
rather cheap.

I again expected to numb my sensi- 
bilizes as so many of us who live in 
our cities have had to do to survive 
the horrors of the bomelessness that 
surrounds us? Cloaking with cal- 
lousness aching hearts that secretly 
long to reach out and help, we now 
step over those whom we once 
would have knelt to lift up. And our 
spirit of justice screams as it quietly 
dies. To me, these dilemmas feel 
the same 

Any economic system that not 
only depends, but insists on 
exploitation and neglect is a bad 
one (communist, capitalist, socialist 
or otherwise). A reporter from one 
of the local newspapers rose and 
spoke, telling the audience that he 
had talked to Sen. Richard Lugar 
earlier that day. According to that 
reporter, the Senator doesn't believe 
it's appropriate for Americans to 
link their concern over human 
rights with trade When I heard this. 



1 began thinking inside. "Well then. 
Sen. Lugar, with what might I ask 
do you suggest we link human 
rights, especially those that are so 
clearly being violated for profit?" I 
suspect Sen. Lugar, among others, 
would prefer we forget about 
human rights altogether, since 
divorcing them from economics is 
as good as forgetting mem I simply 
cannot forget. 

No, I don't think communism is 
the only problem here. Oh. to be 
sure, communism is undoubtedly an 
evil force in China, one that needs 
to be eradicated. But one among 
many, the least of which is certainly 
not the international greed of the 
world opulent. It is market forces, 
Mr Wu. that make prison labor in 
China profitable, jusl as it is market 
forces that make prison in the U.S. 
profitable. For instance, as revealed 
by Christian Parent! in the Jan. 29. 
1996, issue of "The New Republic": 
"Since 1990. thirty stales have 
legalized the contracting out of 
prison labor to private companies" 
here in our country Of course, 
many people don't know this, and a 
number who do know it think (hat 



it's a good idea to make prisoners 
pay their own keep. The problem is 
that many of these prisoners are 
juveniles. Paying their own keep, 
juvenile or otherwise, is not the 
issue. Prisoners working private 
sector jobs that unemployed 
Americans need to put food on their 
tables is the issue. Prisoners work- 
ing for a fraction of the minimum 
wage, intensifying the already 
unbearable competition within the 
tabor market, and further depressing 
working-class wages is the issue. 
Tbe use of prison labor to break 
union strikes and threaten union 
organization is the issue. The ram- 
pant racism in our justice system is 
the issue. The obvious injustice and 
misappropriation of the "thrce- 
strikes-and-you're-out" law is the 
issue. The fact that so many youths 
and adults wind up in prison for 
reasons directly linked to economic 
deprivation in the first place is the 
issue And these are only a very few 
of the issues; I could go on and on. 
You don't need to be an economist 
to see these connections. Use your 
imagination. 

Am I playing the race card? Yes.

S\JWTA$ SAFETY 



by Sharla Scbultz 
Staff Writtr 



Almost everyone likes ihe 
sun. A nice, bright, sunny 
day makes us feel good, 
and a tan is considered by many to 
be beallhy and desirable But the 
sun produces an invisible hazard in 
the form of ultraviolet light. 

Ultraviolet rays are harmful 
because Ihey penetrate the outer- 
most layer of the skin and enter the 
epidermis Here Ibc ultraviolet rays 
stimulate tanning, but also cause 
damage to the epidermal cells (the 
outer most layer of cells) which 
then release an inflammatory sub' 
stance. These travel into the under 
lying layer of the skin, the dermis 
which contains the blood vessels 
nerves and supporting skin tissues 
As a result, the blood vessels dilate, 
causing the skin to lum red and, if 
the damage is more severe, sunburn 
results. Long-term damage results 



in skin cancers and the effects of 
aging, sucb as wrinkles. 

Some of the great sun tanning 
myths arc: 

• A suntan is a sign of health 

(it is a sign of damaged skin). 

• A suntan protects the skin 
against burning or skin 
cancer 

• You will nol get sunburned rf 
ri is cloudy (ultra violet rays 
penetrate clouds). 

•The holler it is, Ihe higher 
the risk of sunburn 
(heat is irrelevant). 

• Children need to be exposed 
to the sun for their health and 
to loughen their skin 
(possibly in the northern 
hemisphere, but they should 
be protecled with sunblock). 

• You will nol get burned if you 
are playing a sport or in Ihe 
water (reflected radiation can 
be just as damaging as thai 
received by lying in the sun). 

There are three types of malignant 



skin cancer. Tbese are basal cell 
carcinoma, squamous cell carcino- 
ma and malignant melanoma. 
Squamous cell carcinoma is of 
great concern because u can spread. 
Melanoma carries a higb fatality 
rate and tends to affect young peo- 
ple. 

Those who are fair-skinned, blue- 
eyed and have blond or reddish hair 
are mosi prone to sunburn and skin 
cancer. The best advice is to avoid 
going out in the sun between 11:30 
a.m. and 3:30 p.m. during the sum- 
Skin cancer can take anywhere 
from ten and thirty years to devel- 
op. Melanoma develops at a faster 
rate. 

Symptoms of skin cancer often 
appear in the form of a sore thai 
will nol heal. See your physician if 
you note: 

• A small, open sore that 
oozes, bleeds or crusts 

• A reddish patch of skin that 
hurls or itches 



• A small, centrally indented 
mole, freckle or lesion with a 
smooth, rolled border 

• A shiny bump or pimple that 
is commonly pink, red or 
white, but may also be black, 
brown or tan 

• A scar-like, tight area of skin 
with a white, yellow or waxy 
appearance 

Sunblock provides the besi protec- 
tion from ultraviolet rays. For chil- 
dren. Ihe Food and Drug 
Administration recommends a sun- 
block wiih Sun Protection Factor 
(SPF) of at least 15 with low or no 
alcohol content. For adults, the Sun 
Protection Factor should be from 
fifteen to thirty, depending on how 
quickly an individual will bum. The 
SPF number is displayed on the 
front of the product. 

Sunshine can be enjoyed without 
Ihe risks by keeping a few simple 
rules: wear suitable clothing, use an 
effective sunblock, tan gently and 
lightly and protect children. 



SPRING BREAK NELL 



Editor 's Picks 



Kdit.. 



The four riders approach — 
Pestilence. Famine, War and 
Death. A college student knows 
these horsemen are more common- 
ly called sales representatives for 
Spring Break trips. 

My usual gang of idiots have 
vowed to give students another 
alternative to the Four Horsemen 
of the Spring Break Apocalypse. 
We have made a list of places in 
which no one should be caught 
dead, drunk or naked. Without fur- 
ther fanfare here are the five most 
pathetic places to spend Spring 
Break. 

• 701 South A-1A Daylona 
Beach, Fla. This holel is one of 
the most popular places in 
Daytona Beach, bul with its pop- 
ularity comes urine in Ihe eleva- 
tor. We thought it was bad in the 
parking garage elevator, but the 



stench in Daytona Beach is the 
worst. 

• Waynedale. We are writing 
this part as we are driving 
though town zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz 
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz huh? what? 
Sorry (ell asleep (aster in 
Waynedale than I did during the 
Lugar speech. 

• Any lown that ends in "villa." 
Hicksville, Monroeville. Danville. 
Kendallville, Amityville— Need 
we say more? 

• Havanna, Cuba by air — 
Those MIGs are going to ruin 
Spring Break for all the boat 
people 

• Love Canal, New York, 
Aren't there enough three-head- 
ed children in the world already? 

There were other places which 
almost made the Use but were just 
too much fun for our list. Some of 
those are: Grabll, Fort Wayne, 
Gary and Iowa. 



Student exchange provides home away from home 



by Amanda Manion 
Features Editor 

Imagine waking up some morn- 
ing in January next year and walk- 
ing to class in 70-degree tempera- 
lures. No, Fort Wayne is not 
expecting a heat wave during our 
typically frigid winter (unfortunate- 
ly). This dream can become a reali- 
ty, however, through the National 
Student Exchange (NSE). 

The department of student acad- 
emic counseling provides the NSE 
program. "The program has existed 
over 25 years and IPFW has partici- 
pated in 20 of those years," associ- 
ate director Laura Herbrand said. 

In order to participate in the 
NSE. students must be taking at 
least 12 credit hours and have a 2.5 



GPA or above. A S90 dollar appli- 
cation fee is required. 

According lo Herbrand, students 
who are accepted to the program 
pay the same tuition as they pay to 
study at home. Even students' 
financial aid may be used with the 
exception of work-study programs. 

NSE was created lo allow stu- 
dents to explore other pans of the 
country and study programs and 
cultures. The program enables them 
to study at an oul-of-staic university 
without having to struggle with the 
added fees. Students may stay at a 
university for one semester or Iwo 
semes lers. 

Charles Roth, a sophomore 
architectural engineenng technolo- 
gy major, attended Southwesi 
Missouri State lasi Fall through 



NSE. 

"(NSE] was exciting. It was a 
college-life experience and cheaper 
than going lo [Indiana University)," 
Roth said. 



Although ihe NSE is open to siudyin; 
sophomores, juniors and seniors, 
Herbrand suggesis that seniors fin- 
ish at their home school. 

Currently. IPFW has students 



; schools in Alaska, 
Arizona. Hawaii. Montana, 
Massachusetts and North Carolina, 
to name only a few. IPFW is host- 
ing four students from other univer- 



sities. 

Anyone interested in joining the 
exchange next fall must contact 
Laura Herbrand at 481-6814 by 
March 1,1996.

Up all night 




by Andrew Yodei 
Staff Writer 



Il's 2:05 a.m.. a chilly, 
fog -shrouded morning al IPFW 
Here in the lounge in 
Hclmkc Library, five 
exhausted students 
sit at wooden tables 
poring over exam 
notes, talking and 
drinking coffee 
from linle paper 
cups This is the 
world of the IPFW 
night owls, students who 
make a regular practice of spending 
large amounts of traditional sleep 
hours on campus This lounge is the 
only place on campus that is still 
open. It will be open all night, every 
night, with enough seating and

that brings these fatigued scholars 
to campus during the wee hours of 
the morning, when most of their 
colleagues are sound asleep? 
"You always find

comes to the Helmke lounge 
because "everything 1 need is here

Krisiina Alexander, a sophomore 
stressed out about chemistry agreed. 



"It [the lighting] is good, and I 
can gel help from people 
who are serious aboui

Alexander said 

Alexander explained that 
the lounge is much loo 
loud for serious study 
during the day. but tha 
after midnight the crowd 
becomes a more academic one

to find diversity among IPFW stu-

Living in the now 




Maybe tomorrow I'll have time 
io eat a proper breakfast. Next 
week I'll call my friends I haven't 
been able to talk to since I've been 
so busy. Nexi month I'll be caught 
up on my bills enough to relax. 
Once I graduate, then things will be 
okay I'll be happy then. I just need 
io check off more things on my to- 
do list. 

After a few years of this, in the 
name of pursuing goals, we may be 
over- stressed, and wonder whether 
this is the way it has io be Yes. we 
want to be successful We bear that 
being determined and persistent is 
the way io reach our goals We 
musi believe in this concept rather 
heartily, for we forego sleep, social 
life and things we enjoy doing in 
pursuit of the job at the end of the 
rainbow But bow do we know thai 
we are soli on the right path if we 
do not stop and look inward? 

The way of the Tao, an Easlem 
philosophy, talks of "going wilh 
the flow." That means harmonious- 
ly following the flow of the river of 
life, even if it takes you in some 
winding directions It means not 
using effort to fight against the flow 
of the river Along the way. you 
can enjoy the scenery, too. 

Author Shakli Gawain writes 
about this river of life, and the 
seeming paradox between doing 



and being We are so 
ingrained in the con- 
cept of doing, doing. 
doing, that it appears 
almost absurd to just 
BE and go wilh the 
flow. 

Is there a contra- 
diction between 
"going with the 
flow" and being suc- 
cessful in life? Or 
does going with the flow actually 
take us where we want to go? 

If life is like a river, then it 
makes sense to navigate a course, 



while still going along with the that we can feel as it is happening. 



basic flow of the river (watch out 
for the boulders) 

People who are consiantly, anx- 
iously trying to manipulate the out- 
side world in order to make them- 
selves happy, says Gawain, are 
fighting against the natural flow of 
life. If you are coming from this 
perspective, she writes, "...either 
you set up so many obstacles to 
yourself that you can't succeed, or 
you do succeed in reaching your 
goals only to find that they don't 
bring you inner happiness " 

The Buddhists talk about some- 
thing translated as "Being here 
now," which involves letting go of 
the strong attachments to things we 
cannot truly control, anyway 

Do you truly feel your life, or 
does it seem like a daze? Are you 
here now, or do you exist in only a 
pre-graduate larva state? 

Taking a break from doing so 
much and just being for a while can 
help us refocus. We see that we are 



not one we merely envision for 
tomorrow.

New PAC 
proposal 



by S. Brant Kelley 
News Editor 

Phillip Marx, an IPFW stu- 
dent and Republican congres- 
sional hopeful, has suggested a 
new way for politicians lo lake 
in PAC money. 

"When you watch the cam- 
paigns, it's almost like some 
days you can tell the way 
they're changing messages," 
Marx said. "They suddenly got 
S 10,000 from the NRA the day 
before, 

"But look at it from another 
point of view If you saw a 
politician ... and you thought 
he was giving you good ser- 
vice, you would want to sup- 
port him with a contribution. 

"You go to a restau- 
rant, and you don't tip them 
first, but if they give you good 
service, you're going to tip 
accordingly," 

While Marx admits that 
many of the details would still 
need to be worked out, the 
basic design of the system can 
keep representatives from 
being influenced by their polit- 
ical campaign's biggest donors 

"What I would advocate 
would be this: I would set up 
an independent trust, a legiti- 
mate company. I would cam- 
paign, I would spread my mes- 
sage, what I believe in, how I 
would behave, and solicit 
donations with my personality. 
Anyone that wanted to donate 
lo my campaign would contact 
that independent company. On 
a weekly or a monthly basis. 
that money would be released 
in blocks to me I would not 
know who was giving mc 
money." 

Marx also proposes a way 
for contributions to become 
public. 

"You have to have an 
accounting procedure, so ... 
after the end of my two-year 
period, I would have full dis- 
closure of that." be said. 

The most important part of 
Marx's system would be to get 
away from the way large politi- 
cal contributors can influence 
politicians under the present 
setup, 

"The way it's set up, it defi- 
nitely smacks of corruption 
today." Marx said. 

"The problem comes in ... 
when they give you the money 
first ... somebody gives you a 
tbousand dollars, you pay 
attention loihai."

Student runs for congress 



by S. Brant Ketley 
News Editor 

Congressman Mark Souder will 
enter the Republican congressional 
primaries against an opponent from 
the IPFW community. IPFW stu- 
dent Phillip Marx plans to contest 
Souder for the Republican nomina- 
tion for Indiana's fourth congres- 
sional district. 

The 28-ycar-old Marx said he 
didn't find a fourth district candi- 
date who expressed political views 
similar enough to his own to war- 
rant his support, so he said he 
decided to run instead. 

"I do believe (the Republicans) 
are getting a little out of control," 
Marx said. "I am a registered 
Republican, I have always been I 
think they're getting a Utile out of 
control in [he environment. 

"I don'l think they've given 
enough foresight exactly lo what 
that entails " 

Marx cited recent Republican 
proposals to remove the federal 
government from the welfare sys- 
tem He said that in an effort to 
reduce costs, various slates would 
drastically reduce their welfare pro- 
grams, leaving many working poor 
people out in the cold 

"They should address that on a 
national scale," be said. 

Marx said he also does not agree 
on many Republican proposals 
which affect environmental con- 
cerns, but he admitted that he didn'l 
have a clear view of Souder's envi- 
ronmental voting record. 

"I'm just gelling into this." he 
said "I'm trying to correlate how 
well Souder's record actually goes 
with Congress'. The Republican 
Congress, as a whole, seems to cor- 
relate pretty well with the points I 
am against 

"I need lo find enough specifics 
on it There's a bill that looks like, 
specifically, they voted lo allow 
businesses lo dump sludge in rivers 
with a promise that they would 



clean it up in the future ... To me, 
that's just ridiculous. 

"I don'l know if Congressman 
Souder is for these things or if he is 
being led by other Republicans, but 
I want to gel bis attention, I want lo 
get the Republican Parly's atten- 
tion." 

Marx said he had a duty to ran 
against Souder when he searched 
and found out (bat nobody else was 
challenging Souder's .Republican 
nomination He also said he 
believes that the ideas of both 
Souder and probable Democratic 
challenger, IPFW professor Jerry 
Houseman, are both weak. 

An economics major. Marx orig- 
inally entered IPFW as an engineer- 



ing student, bui decided he was 
more interested in international 
business and politics. 

"It took me about two years," 
Marx said. "But one summer, I was 
checking out some different classes 
I took in economics and political 
science ... I have decided (to pur- 
sue) a bachelor of ans in economics 
and a certificate in international 
affairs " 

Before entering college. Marx 
held a variety of jobs. He graduated 
from high school thinking he would 
never attend college, but did not 
find the opportunities for people 
with only a high school diploma to 
his taste.

NBA ON TARGET TO BECOME 'FEE'-FOR-ALL 




Tbe National Basketball 
Associaiion's trading deadline 
came and went last week with the 
usual "we'll trade our worthless

sort of deals. The only trade worth 
noting was the Miami Heat's acqui-

Sacramento, as Williams was the

Reggie Miller has already turned 
down a lucrative deal from the

his bags are already packed. The

Angeles, but tbe Lakers are already 
loaded at guard and who in their 
rigbt mind would jump ship (o play 
for the Cuppers. I look for Miller to 
head for warmer weather alright, 
but be will be soaking up rays in a 
Heat uniform next year, not in 
California. 

Shaquille O'Neal is another 
player the Lakers covet. Tbe only 
way O'Neal would leave Orlando, 
though, is if he feels the team 
develops a Buffalo Bills mentality 
If be feels the rest of the Magic quit 
on bim. Shaq will be headed for 
Hollywood Tbe Lakers will have 
plenty of money to encourage him 
to don the purple and gold. Tbe 
other good thing about Shaq doing 
"Tinsel Town" is that we will then 
get to seem him on television more 
often. There's a dream come true 

As far as Michael Jordan is con- 
cerned, both he and the Bulls know 
he is going nowhere, so forget 
about it. Still, I can't help bul won- 
der how good his "Armess" would 
be if he were to leave Chicago to 
play for a team like the 76'ers. But, 



I'm dreaming. Jordan isn't going 
anywhere, and the Bulls will keep 
steamrolling to my disapproval. 

The most intriguing free agent is 
Juwan Howard He's not only a 
young and talented player, but also 
already an All-Star. He's going to 
be asking for a lot of money and the 
Washington Wizards (that's right. 
Wizards) will probably not want to 
pay what he's asking. The question 
is can money pry Howard away 
from his best bud Chris Webber? 
In this case, you bet Howard is a 
strong, bard-working player who 
will appeal to Cleveland Cavaliers 
coach Mike Fraiello. Look for 
Howard to be wearing baby blue 
next year. 

It's sad to see the league chang- 
ing for the sake of money If the 
young players in the NBA today are 
going to keep the game alive, they 
need to drop trje greedy attitudes. 
Maybe now that Magic Johnson has 
returned we can coax Larry Bird 
out of the stands like in the beer 
commercial to restore the honor of 
the game.

Sports Editor 

Damn those Cardinals! In from 
of nearly 3.000 faithful volleyball 
fans, the Cards once again played 
the role of spoiler for the 'Dons. 

Early in the match, especially in 
games one and two, the 'Dons 
looked as though ihey had forgot- 
ten how to pass the ball and hit 
with authority. 

After beginning Ihc match by 
reeling off four consecutive points, 
the 'Dons fell apart. A 4-0 advan- 
tage quickly evaporated into a 4-4 
tie. Ball State outscorcd the 'Dons 
11-4 to close out game one of the 
match and won the game 15-8. 

Game two proved to be much 
the same. 

The Mastodons passed well and 
hit with a new-found thunder in 
game three. They forced error after 
error by the Cardinals and ultimate- 
ly won the game 15-9, 

In game four Ball State put the 
match away and won 15-9. 

The Mastodons are slowly 
beginning to come together as a 
team. A talented group of individu- 
als is inching closer to a team con- 
cept and may be able to surprise 
some opponents as the season pro- 
gresses. 

The team will get its first chance 
at redemption next Wednesday at 
the Gates Center. 

A match against MIVA foe 
Wisconsin-Milwaukee originally 
scheduled for March 8 has been 
rescheduled for Wednesday, March 
6. Coach Arnie Ball rescheduled 
the match to accommodate the pos- 
sibility of the women's basketball 
team hosting the first round of the 
NCAA Division II tournament at 
the Gates Center.
