Convocations Committee 

One frequently heard complainl in past years has been thai Hie Omvoe.-jlioris 
Committee has not sought, or made use of, student input in its efforts lo provide 
programs for the campus. 

The new committee has gotten off to a good start in remedying the situation. 
; Committee members have been solicilint; sliiflenl sue.|.;i'sh"iis during (lie pasl lew 
days and providing informational mal crinls lo aid people in inak inn specific 
recommendations of programs for which they'd like In have sludenl aclivily fee 
money spent. 

This could surely lead to a well-rounded series nf aelivilies for the upcoming 
ar-programs which will appeal to a broad ratine ol iuieresi groups and might 
ver have been considered relying on the judgement of a select few. 
Here, too, students who responded In committee queries are lo be thanked; 
: those who did not cannot complain ahoul final selections. 

This, of course, does not signal the end of apathy on this campus Nor does it 
1 next year's activities will be more responsive to sludenl interests than 
they've been in the past But the efforts of the committee are appreciated. 
Hopefully, other facets of student government will periodically assess sludenl 
opinion in a similiar fashion. 



LETTERS 

TO THE EDITOR 



NAACP schedules mass march on Boston May 17 




Sometimes, 

the best stereo is the one 

you don't know is there. 




There are those moments in life wher 
you don't want your stereo to be so 
noticeable. You don't really care to be 
reminded that it is the world's finest 
system. Or that it has superior 
engineering. Or that it is backed by 
qualified sales and service specialists. 

Sometimes, you want your stereo to 
provide a very special background for a 



• F

very special occasion. 

That's the kind of stereo you can buy 
at Fort Wayne Electronics. A stereo that 
stands out when you want it to, and 
mellows when the mood calls for that. 

Fine music from a fine stereo system 
Ask our Stereo Tips people to show you a 
system that will do that for you.
