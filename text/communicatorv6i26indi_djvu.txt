Lantz retires 



Pari-mutuels in Indiana : Why not? 



Assistant Dean Joanne Lantz has announced her "retirement" from the 
student services office. She is not actually going into retirement; she will return to 
teaching in the psychology department, where her IPFW career started. 

She has been well liked by the student government leaders who have worked 
wirh her during her four year tenure as a student dean. Her no-nonsense approach 
to student problems was a refreshing change from the usual bureaucratic way of 
d.tirmlhinti-. She nut things dune, which should be the acid test of university deans 

The admiration she enjoys was manifested in a plaque she received from the 
student leaders, who presented it to her via Pal Paulson in front of a crowd of 400 at 
a campus convocation, 

The Communicator will especially miss her She has served the pasl two years 
as chairman of this paper's hoard of directors The initial year was no picnic for 
The Communicator as il faced a fiercely compel ilive adverlising world for the first 
time, an almost Imslilc university adminislralion, and a * 12,000 operating loss. 
Dean Lantz worked and worried with the rest of us to keep the paper in business 

The Communicator did stay in business. It proved itself a good source for 
advertising, the university adminisli alimi became supportive, and last year's 
losses have lurried into Ibis year's profits. Dean Lant/'s contribution during this 
period was one that only the staff and other board members can comprehend. 

She leaves The (oiuiniinicaliirsiaiidiniiliiiir square on the ground. For this we 
are appreciative. Even so, she will be missed. 

Student services has lusl an oulslandmc administrator and leader. The faculty 
has gained an outstanding teacher and student advocate.

The Volvo Warranty: 
12 MONTHS OR 999,999 MILES. 
WHICHEVER COMES FIRST. 



Every new Volvo is warranted to be free of defects in materials and 
workmanship for 12 months (no matter how many miles you drive i 
long as the car has the recommended i ' 
tenance ) from the dale of delivery. 

Warranty repairs must be made at an 
authorized Volvo dealer in the U.S. &lt; 
Canada. There will be no charge 
for parts and labor. 

Of course, a Volvo also 
comes with other warranties: 
Volvo's emission control 
system is warranted for five 
years or 50,000 miles (with 
recommended mainlenance) 
whichever occurs first. Tires, 
rally, are warranted separately by their r 
facturer. Also, the addition and replace 
and fillers are at the owner's expense. 

Now that we've shown you some protection in writing, drop by and 
we'll show you some protection in driving: our Volvo.
