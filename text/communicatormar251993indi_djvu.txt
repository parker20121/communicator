IPFW hosts K-1 2 

Science fair draws students 



By Kent Jakway 
Features editor 
Last Saturday IPFW hosted the 
Northeast Indiana Regional Science 
and Engineering Fair. Students from 
grades K-12 competed for a chance to 
represent the region in April at the 
HoosicT Science and Engineering Fair 
in Indianapolis. 



"We believe ii is a great prospective 
to bring people to campus," said 
Roger D. Hack, campus organizer. "It 
is a community service for us to host 
this event." 

This event was one of twelve re- 
gional science fairs. 

Over 400 students gave 
presentations. 




designed by Widicr Scholer and As- 
sociates and James Architects and 
Engineers, with Weigand Construc- 
tion as the general contractor for the 
project. 

According to Steve Sarratore. chair 
of the Theatre at IPFW. the depan- 
ment was involved in the design for 
the theater throughout Uie course of 
construction. However, the largest 
benefit is the additional space offered 
over existing facilities. 

"The mosi exciiing aspect of the 
new building is it will allow for ex- 
pansion of the theater program here at 
IPFW, and open up opportunides for 
more student productions." said 
Sarratore. 

"Students will be allowed to work 
in the new theater and PIT," he said. 

The April 16 dedication gala will 
include a viewing of an original work 
of art, "Tribute," created by Nancy 
McCroskey. John Hrchov, and Ann-

Jill Long discusses budget, business 



By Laura Lineback 
Acting Managing Editor 

Jill Long, 4th district congress- 
woman, spoke 10 members of IPFW's 
Delta Sigma Pi professional business 
fratcrrtiiy on March 20 ai the Class- 
room Medical Building, Terri Walton, 
vice president of professional activi- 
ties, introduced Long, who is also a 
member of diis Greek organization. 

Long, who has a Ph.D. in business, 
spoke about her interest in politics as 
a business student sixteen years ago. 

"As a business student 1 would lis- 
ten to what members of Congress and 
elected officials would aboul ihc 
economy and the national budget," 
began Long. "All of these people in 
Washington were saying things about 
the economy that just didn'i match 



what I knew about economics from 
the courses 1 was taking as a business 
student." 

Long ran for several offices unsuc- 
cessfully until she won in a special 
election for an open congressional 



scat in 1989. 

"I can tell you very honestly thai the 
government runs ^^^^— ^^^— 

than you &lt;*ig( ^g Just say that it was '^e spending in 



of four trillion dollars and an annual 
deficit of 400 billion dollars is noi 
that people in congress don't have an 
understanding of what it is that peo- 
ple in this country want, its that we 
have an understanding very well of 
what people want. And they want 
government programs," Long said. 

"The majority of 



think it does," said , , ■ . j •_. 

^ men who got us into debt. 

Long bchcvcs -J'U Long 

that the news me- 



dia does not always present a tmc im- 
age of the government. 

Addressing the national debt Long 
maintained thai the cause for the Huge 
deficit is not due to misunderstanding 
on the part of congress members. 

"One of the reasons we have a debt 



the federal gov- 

enmient is not for 

pork barrel pro- 

^i^vM^^^^^ jecls." she added. 

Long explained that two thirds of 
the annual budget includes military 
spending, interest on the national 
debt, and Medicare ai^J ,^cdicaid. 
She also said that the United Stales is 
currently the world's largest debtor 
nauon. 



The congresswoman commented on 
the fact that the number of women in 
Congress has increased significantly 
in the past few years. Ttaditionally, 
women were given the responsibility 
lo deal with health care and social is- 
sues while men worked with econom- 
ic and military matters. 

"Let me just say that it was men 
who got us inio Ihc debt level of four 
trillion dollars. Why do people think 
women arc less capable to deal with 
economic is.sues?" said Long. 

Long urged business students to 
consider running for public office and 
offCTcd her help for anyone in need of 
advice. 



Controversy continues 



Bearing to visit IPFW next Monday 



By Ngozi R. Rogers 

Next Monday, Steven Beering, 
president of Purdue University, and 
Fred Ford, Purdue treasurer, will 
visit the IPFW campus. They plan 
to discuss the new fiscal manage- 
ment agreement to be approved in 
July, 

IPFW faculty are up in arms since 
Bccring's last secret visit two 
weeks ago when he told IPFW ad- 
ministrators and faculty that he 
plans to make ail IPFW faculty Pur- 
due employees. 

Ford told the Communicator ttiai 
there are two kinds of problems at 
IPFW: operating problems and 
philosophical questions. Operating 
problems consist of inequality of 
benefits for lU faculty as opposed 
to Purdue's better faculty benefits. 

"Purdue's benefits arc better and 
this problem needs to be ad- 
dressed." said Ford. 

The philosophical question con- 
cerns conforming to Purdue's sys- 
tem of managing IPFW and IPFW's 
bid for fiscal autonomy. 

wants more independence 



and that's fine, but it's not work- 
able," emphasized Ford. 

It's that kind of doubletalk from 
Ford and Beering 's lack of coopera- 
tion that causes the conllici, accord- 
ing to Bill Frederick, presiding offi- 
cer of the faculty 
senate and IPFW 
associate professor 
of computer sci- 
ence. 

"Beering has a 
control thing. He 
is trying to erode 
our academic au- 
tonomy ai the un- 
dergraduate level 
as well as deny us 
any leeway in the 
new management 
agreemeni," said 
Frederick. 

John Walda, lU 
Board of Trustees member and Fon 
Wayne attorney, feels that some 
changes need to be made in the 
management agreement and that 
fiscal autonomy must be addressed 
by the lU tnisiees. 

Walda believes that input from 




IPFW administration, faculty, and 
students is mandatory to adequately 
address campus needs. 

"The general feeling on the board 
about the amount of locaJ autonomy 
needs to be addres,sed. We want to 
make sure the new 
agreemeni ad- 
dresses the con- 
cerns addressed to 
us at the faculty 
and administration 
meetings." said 
Walda. 

Ford said. "The 
new management 
agreement needs 
to conform to the 
Purdue way of do- 
ing things." 

Although the 
management 
agreement implies 
cooperation of two parties. Ford 
said that Purdue makes the deci- 
sions. 

WaJda said that he does not agree 
with that type of thinking on the 
pan of Ford and Beering. 
"1 have been in several meetings 



with Beering. This [management 
agreemenil is a contract with the 
two parties involved, lU trustees 
and Purdue tnistees," said Walda. 

"The local people arc very impor- 
tant." Walda continued. "I won't 
consider the new agreement with- 
out input from IPIWs faculty, ad- 
ministrators, and students. 

Walda said that he considers it un- 
thinkable for the new agreement to 
force IPFW faculty to become Pur- 
due employees if the local people 
are opposed to it. 

We need lo be sensitive to the ex- 
tent of the new management agree- 
ment," Walda concluded, 

Michael Downs, chair of political 
science, ihinks that Beering can 
force his opinions and policies on 
the school without regard to local 
opinion. He cited the example of 
IPFW chancellors since the mid- 
1970s, 

"Beering has gotten rid of every 
chancellor thai sticks up too much 
for IPFW for probably fifteen years. 
He would probably fire Joanne 
Lantz, except that she's retiring 
next year," said Downs.

Last week. Student Senate invited 
Philip R, Groie. IPFW Comptroller, 
to discuss the figures of the proposed 
bi-annual fiscal budget by the Gener- 
al Assembly for IPFW. IT the por- 
posed budget is approved, this 
campus will be facing a 75 percent 
decrease in funding from the Gen- 
eral Assembly. 

Purdue University proposed $5.7 
million for 1993-94 for IPFW. The 
House wants to appr o priate only S1.4 
million. This loss is projected to in- 
crease IPFW student fees 8 lo 10 per- 
cent next fall. 

"The Purdue Board of Trustees is 
reluctant to increase student fees 8 
percent,- said Philip R. Groie, IPFW 



compiroller. 

The proposed budget for the second 
year (1994-95) is worse. Purdue re- 
quested S4.3 million for this campus. 
The House wants 10 allocate a dismal 
total operating budget of S356.886 
(three hundred fifty-six thousand, 
eight hundred eighty-six dollars). 

"Obviously, not all our needs will 
be met. The economy of the state 
cannot be expected to fund IPFW at 
that level," said Grote, 

"The senaie version is due out in the 
next few days. I think it will be a lit- 
tle better, but I haven't seen anything 
in writing." Grote added. 

Grote confirmed thai Purdue Uni- 
versity is holding Sl2 million in re- 
serve, called contingency funds for 
IPFW, but said thai they cannot be 
used for any operauonal needs. 

Although nicknamed 'rainy day' 
funds, this money is restricted to such 



things as debt reduction and building 
reserves. Other contingency funds 
can cover things such as utility in- 

Eleven areas of the proposed budget 
will take a complete cut in total fund- 
ing for 1993-94, No longer will there 
be money for the following four ar- 
eas; enhancing undergraduate educa- 
tion, workforce development, recruit- 
ment and die retention of minoiities, 
and campus support services. 

Other areas not receiving any mon- 
ey will be the library, supplies and 
expenses, and no faculty and/or staff 

Unavoidable costs, such as medical 
insurance, utilities, and Americans 
wilh Disabihties Act (ADA) building 
and campus upgrades also will re- 
ceive zero funding for the next two 
yean. 

" We will still be mandated by the 



federal government to make building 
and property adjustments for the 
ADA students even though there will 
be no money." said Grote. 

These unavoidable costs will be 
made up in student fee increases ac- 
cording to Grote, 

His plan includes student fee in- 
creases, reducing funding for 'needs,' 
and reallocation of other funds. 

"1/ the student eniolhncm increases 
next year or the following year, there 
will be no money to provide for addi- 
tional pan-lime faculty members, any 
supplies or necessary maeases. such 
as paperwork, educational materials 
or additional staff," Groic informed 
The Communiauor. 

The General Assembly Senaie ver- 
sion numbers, I heard, were better 
[than the House figuresl. but not thai 
much better," concluded Orotc.

'Just say no' to Beering 



Ne«i Monday, when Purdue prcii- 
deni Sieve ficcting arrives ai IPFW 
would be a good time for iiudenu lo 
Ici him know ihu the majority of ui 
warn to gel mote value for our money. 

Although feci ue compirible. do 
we have to pay a gieaier percentage 
OU1 of pocleel (or our ctassc) than 
West Lalsyeiir students? Currently 
we Bijb)ldi;:e over -10 cenis out of 
every dollar directly for out cduca- 
tioni here at [PFW. Purdue Wcsi 
Ldrayclic siudenis finance 25 cents 
out of every dollar directly. 

Why are IPFW siudenU gelling a 
smalln piece of the Gcncial Assem- 
bly's finandal pie thikn other schools 
of comparable size and stniciure? It's 
because Purdue University makes our 
university budget, and they ore trcoi- 
ing IPPW as an ugly step-child to the 
tune of Sb,6 million dollars less for 
out students per year. 

Maybe we ought to call it the Cin- 
derella complex. Our sicpmothcr, Pur- 
due, sure doesn't want us to go lo the 
ball. If that happened, IPFW would be 
able to get things thai arc rtow only on 
o(jr wish list: dorms, more services for 
students, poslponemcnl of fee increas- 
es for awhile, iuid mote quality facul- 
ty (due to more money). 



We're sure that our readers could 
come up with other wish lists that 
could work within a budget of S6,6 
million more pe&gt; year. 

It seems that our only hope of meet- 
ing the handsome prir)cc is through a 
new management agreement thai ad- 
dresses the many needs of this cam- 

Beedng's attempt to change all fac- 
ulty to Purdue employees is not meet- 
ing a rieed on this campus, but a vin- 
dictive attempt to gel back at IPFW 
for all the bad press Purdue has taken 
recently. That we don't want in the 
new agreement 

Our informal poll of lU faculty on 
this campus was 100 pcrc«ni opposed 
to becoming Purdue employees. Our 
informal poll of IPFW students 
showed they were also 100 percent 
opposed. 

Our message lo Beering nesi Mon- 
day needs lo be: Not all tPFW faculty 
needs to be Purdue employees. As the 
old saying goes, 'If it ain't broke. 

He also must be told that there arc 
other issues at IPFW that dcrmilciy 
need to be addressed head on. It's to 
his benefit to lisicn. If not. Beering 
may end up holding the pumpkin.

More Roses 

A rose to Mark Snyder for bringing 
an issue to public ancntion: the S100 
per petson charge to attend the Fine 
Ans Gala Opening is unalTonlable to 
rtloslIPFWsfudcnis, 

Snydei pointed out the fact that col- 
lege students have little spate change 



to spend on extravagant functions. 
Most of us do not have a section in 
our budgets entitled "elegant occa- 
sions," Tuition, books, special fees, 

penses leave gaps in our pockets and 
pockciljooks, too big [0 repair. Full- 
time employment only spares us from 
accumulating college loan debts the 
size of the naiionsd deficit. 

If in a year's time we save die mon- 
ey spent on ihe once-in-a-while 
movies, concerts, dining out, and oth- 
er sources of sometimes affordable 
cnicriainmcnt, we frugal students 
would be able to pay out SIOO plus 
buy or rent appropriate otlite, for a 
singular gala event. 

However, most students ate not dis- 
ciplined sufficiently to tutn down the 
temptation to take an occasional 
tesplie &amp;om our studies and visit the 
cinemas, bars, ot the teslautants. In- 
stead of saying, "I'll lake a break at 
the end of the 1992-93 academic 
year," we most likely spend whol we 
have left over whenever possible to 
"gel out and get away." 

Still, there are those of us who can- 
not enjoy even the affordable, plebian 
types of entertainment. Many have 
known what it b to truly do without 
Perhaps, the thought of attending 
such a function as a gala opening has 
not even crossed out mmds. 

There is no shame in being poot-it's 
jusi a might unhandy Yet it humbles 
us to be poor. We may be slightly ed- 
ucated (or hope to be), but we have 
no economic power. We all know that 
social equality among the haves and 
have-nots does iwi exist in the U.S. 

The Rne Arts Gala is principally a 
fundraiser. We, the students, should 
be thankful that there arc those who 
will pay SIOO lo suppon die fine and 
pctfoiming arts program.

and tours of the new theater, will be 
held on April 29 from 4 to 7 pjn. For

Policy hurts student 



To the editor: 

I am writing this Idler on behalf of 
any students who have ever been un- 
justly penalized by an unfair (and 
usually unnecessary) classroom alien- 
dance policy. I am quite confident that 
this situation is probably not unique 
10 me. 

I am the single parent of a child who 
is under the care of several doctors- 
boih locally and at Riley Hospital, 
Typically I will need to miss a class 
three of foiii' limes'per senicster in or- 
der 10 lake her lo her needed appoint- 
ments. Most doctors don't schedule 
during laic night hours in order lo ac- 
commodate those of us who are dis- 
criminated against because of an at- 
tendance policy. (Just a note of infor- 
mation for you professors who 
weren't aware of that!) 

I am reminded every semester of ihe 
obvious ignorance thai seems to 
plague many of the professors on this 
campus. This would include all of the 
professors who have found it neces- 
sary 10 penalize my grade or require 
extra assigrunents when I have had lo 
take my daughter to the doctor. Since 
you are made aware of the situation 



prior to a missed class, I believe (here 
is no jusiification for your uncaring 
and unsympathetic aliiiude. 

What in the world arc you people 
thinking? Ttust me, I would much 
rather be in a classroom than in the 
doctor's office. You can't possibly 
think I enjoy getting behind in a lec- 
ture and trying to make sense of 
someone else's class notes. 

I have had it with the unfair Ireai- 
-^nt imposed upon responsible stu- 
dents who are also trying to be re- 
sponsible parents as well. To all of 
you professors who are having diffi- 
culty understanding how I could pos- 
sibly miss one of your precious lec- 
tures I have two things to say: 1) you 
need to thank your lucky stars you 
don't have to deal with anything like 
a handicapped person roust, and 2) 
what more could you possibly want? 1 
am sure that anyone in my same situ- 
ation, and I'll bet there are more than 
a few, would also like lo say, 
"Enough is enough!" It's time to get a 
clue, folks. The world does not 
evolve around your hour of lecture!

IPFW mission defined 



To the editor: 

As has been rcponcd recently in 
not only this newspaper, but both of 
our ci^ newspapers, there is a debate 
raging between IPFW and Purdue 
University over financial autonomy. 
Noticeably absent from the argu- 
ments of Ihose favoring such autono- 
my is its impact, negatively or posi- 
tively, on students. This comes as no 
surprise lo those of us who have seen 
the purpose of the university undergo 
reactionary change in the last twenty 
years. 

Most parents, legislators, and per- 
haps even college trustees, still have 
a mental picture ot a university 
mainly as a place where people go to 
be educated. The very phrase "higher 
education" encourages such specula- 
tion. Professors arc still called col- 
lege "teachers," as if their primary 
mission were the nurturing of minds 
and the passing on of the accumulat- 
ed wisdom of the academy to their 
students. And even though spending 
for instruction is less than one-third 
of most university budgets, the aver- 
age American persists in thinking 
that the classroom is the center of ac- 
tivity of a university. 

Because it makes good relations 



with the pubUc (as well as with the 
legislature), university administrators 
encourage such fanciful notions. Bui 
among themselves, ihcy know how 
anachronistic and downright inaccu- 
rate they are. 

Asked to describe the mission of 
his school, a vice chancellor of a Big 
Ten university listed live separate ar- 
eas of responsibility; 

- Economic development 
■ • Service to the Sute 

- The creation of new knowledge 
■" -TrBining graduate students 

And, fmally, dead last; 

- Teaching 

Fortunately, leaching has not been 
totally abandoned at fPFW. In fact, 
there are several faculty members on 
this campus who still seem to believe 
that leaching is their primary reason 
for existing at the university. The 
handwriting, however, may be on the 
wall as the latest and certainly most 
public issue captivating IPFW's fac- 
ulty to date seems to be having the 
ability to choose the color of campus 
decor rather than firxling ways to im- 
prove the true mission of the univer- 
sity; leaching.

New lab hours inconvenience student 



To the Editor; 

I would like to bring a situation that 
exists in the Walb Union Building, to 
the attention of ihe other students on 
campus. 1 don't know if you arc 
aware of tliis or not, but there have 
been restrictions placed on the hours 
students can use the computer lab. As 
you may know, the computer lab in 
Walb was one of 3 that were always 
available to students that needed to 
write papers. This was wonderful. Es- 
pecially ai the end of the semester 
when everyone had something due at 
the same time. Let me tell you whai 



the "new" hours for the computer lab 
arc (keep in mind; I am only listing 
the times that the lab is available to 
siudems.) 
Monday and Tuesday; 

5 p.m. to lOpjn. 
Wednesday: closed 
Thursday and Friday: 

8 am. to lOpjn, 
Saturday: 

8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. 
Sunday: 

12:30 p.m. 10 10 p.m. 
As you can see, the only major 
change was to the hours on Monday, 



Tuesday, and Wednesday, 1 would like 
to know how ihey can just change the 
hours of what is supposed to be a con- 
venience for the students? I know they 
use the computer lab for placement 
testing, but why do they have to use it 
during Oie peak hours of the days un- 
derlined? I'm sure the powers -ihai-bc 
think this is a satisfactory arrange- 
ment. I would like to know why the 
placertwni tests can't be given on Sat- 
urdays, or in the evenings. There are 
many students that rely on public 
transportation to get around. This 
makes it impossible to utilize the com- 



puter lab on any wccknighi, or on 
Simday. If there is going to be a major 
change of this nature, I think the stu- 
dents should have a say in iL Have the 
Student's Govemmeni do an opinion 
poll to see what everyone can agree 
on. I know ot many students that were 
very upset to find thai the computer 
lab was"oiriiniiLs" to them. I'm sure 
that a mutually satisfactory agree- 
ment could be reached, if communi- 
caiion lines which currently eust 
are fully utilized.

Vacation inspires writer 



When 1 tell people about my vacation prayed to God, and figured out the 

jn hell — about how wc were stucic in a problem with ihe car by lalking with 

motel room in the mountains of North the truckers in the lobby of ihe motel 

Carolina in the hcan of the BVizzanl of and then opening the hcxid of the cat to 

Uic Ceniury for three days with nothing see thai, yes indeed, the fan belt was 

but convenience Store food to eat and broken. Wc then knew that God would 

no means lo get rcaJ food because our send the manager of a Ford dealership 



lenial car was brolccn 
and every auto repair 
shop around was closed 
and ihc nearest Henz of- 
fice, located in Ihc 
closed airport at 
Ashevillc. was closed. 
but that didn't matter 
anyway because all pos- 
sible routes home were 
closed and we were all 
severely sick of each 
other and there were 
other personal traumas 
that, 10 protect the inno- 
cent, I won't go into 
here — they all say the 
same thing; "Well, at 
least now you have something to write 
about in your column." 

This is true. 1 guess that's one advan- 
tage to being a writer. No matter how 
horrible and traumatic an experience is. 
you can always turn it into an award- 
winning essay, and. in some cases 
(where cannibalism is involved,) a 
movie deal as well 

So anyway I have lots of people 
Idling me I should write about my 
Spring Break, although I'm a little hes- 
itant, ] don't know why, perhaps it's 
because rehashing these memories is 
like drinking shards of broken glass 
followed by a Vodka chaser 

But 1 will admit thai ihe writer in mc, 
always looking for something to blath- 
er about, did explore the possibility of 
an article about my vacation. 

i thought of the Reader's Digest res- 
cucd-from-thc-jaws-of-death-[ype ap- 
proach to my story. "There was no way 
out. Our chances looked bleak and wc 
started lo lose faith. But with death at 
our heels, we became possessed by a

with joy. In the end. we 
knew it was our faith, 
our hope, and our coura- 
geous will to stay alive 
that kept us from freez- 
ing to death in our 80- 
degree heated mote! 

I also thought of the 
philosophical approach. 
"It was man against na- 
ture. Mother Nature 



pondered the idea that we don't own 
technology, it owns us. And I asked 
myself, wouldn't Elmer Fudd be an ex- 
cellent argument for gun control?" 

And, of course, I thought of the hu- 
morous approach to my story, "Take 
my vacation... please!" 

But seriously, people love to laugh at 
other people's misfortunes. This is why 
National Lampoon's "Vacation" 
movies are so popular. The Griswolds 
and their wacky misadventures are a 
source of laughter, happiness, and good 
cheer for all of us. All of us, that is, ev 
cepi for the Griswolds. As manyrs of 
Humor, they'll be spending years in 
therapy trying to overcome the memo- 
ries of those vacations. Meanwhile we,

Driver frightens pedestrians 



To Ihe editor: 

I am VfTiting to complain about peo- 
ple's driving practices here on 
IPFW's campus. 

Today, March 20, 1993. (around 
10:00) I walked out of Keitler Hall 
and toward the first pan of parking lot 
10. which is B parking. When I 
crossed the pedestrian walkway, there 
was a man in front of mc and several 
people behind me. About three- 
fourths of the way through the walk- 
way, a young woman pulled out of 
parking lot 10 and "floored it." The 
reason I say she "floored ii" is be- 
cause you coiJd hear her car speed up 
instantly. Of course, all of us in the 
walkway slopped instantly. It was 
quite obvious, especially for the man 
in front of me, had we taken another 
step we would have been hit Need- 
less to say, ihis woman flew right 
through the walkway as if we weren't 
even there. Even more unbelievable 
to me was the fact that her face 
showed no expression or that she 



even cared about coming extremely 
close to hitting someone. 

Apparently, this woman feels that 
since she is in a car. which is bigger 
ihan a pedestrian, she has the right-of- 
way, because obviously, the polcsoi- 
an IS going to try to avoid being hit. 
Well. I would like for her to know 
that she does not have the right-of- 
way over a pedestrian. I am not say- 
ing a pedestrian can walk out in front 
of a car two feet away and expect it to 
stop. However, in the instance that I 
have described, the road was clear 
and the walkway was safe to cross. 
She, on ihe other hand, made it un- 
safe. She didn't give a thought to 
what the consequences would be if 
she hit someone. 

Suppose she hit both the man and 
mc. Suppose she was going fast 
enough to kill us. She would not have 
been charged for two deaths, but 
probably three: the man's, mine and 
the baby I am carrying, since 1 am 
currently 20 weeks prcgnani and have 



been feeling life for some lime. She 
would be liable for medical expenses 
before our deaths (ambulance, emer- 
gency room), possibly funeral costs, 
possibly attorney fees, since I could 
almost bci there would be a wrongful 
death suit brought against her. and 
probably many more expenses. Be- 
sides moneiary expenses, she would 
probably be faced with the mental 
and emotional stress of having lo live 
with what she had done. Also. I 
would like for her lo have to explain 
to my three year old son thai he will 
never sec his mommy again bccjuse 
of her recklessness. 

Now, 1 realize this is all hypotheti- 
cal, but it could have happened. So, 
the next time you get in your car and 
feel like "flooring it" even when there 
are pedestrians around, think about 
the damage you can cause It could 
just be a broken leg. or it could be a 
life, Tliink about Itll

Stalking the bureaucratic beast 



I may nol be ihc first person to rec- 
ognize bureaucTBcy as a force of na- 
ture, bol I am one of the few lo grap- 
ple wiih the monsier and force ii lo 
lign iis true name ) wilt relate how 1 

Commentary 

tracked the wjly beast, cornered ii in 
its lair, ilcw it. and drank of its still- 
iteaming blood. First, I must admit 
having been on both sides of the 
desk. My first experience with bu- 
reaucracy was as a bona-fidc paper 
pusher for the library. I was paid 
quite generously to sit behind a desk 
and occasionally fill out an applica- 
tiori — but I was not allowed to read a 
book during my frequent periods of 
doing nothing, I guess I appeared 
more professional for&amp;ing paper clip 
jewelry, laying siege to the Chateau 
de Card Catalogue with my patented 
Siaplcr-a-pull. and penning thumb- 
flip canoons on the stacks of applica- 
tions. My second encounter involved 
mc unsuccessfully offering a five dol- 
lar bill as photo i) ai the Fori Wayne 
License Bureau. Despite the stem 
glare I received from a nearby state 
trooper. I walked away a free man. 

Day 1: My grandparents, who mi- 
grate lo Florida for the winter, need- 
ed a form signed by a law enforce- 
ment agency or vehicle registration 
agency, which would stale that there 
are no emissions laws here in Allen 
County. Without this signed form, 
my grandparents would be unable to 
legally drive the four-masted galleon 
they still insist is a car. My dad told 
me that the license branch had moved 
into Ihc Scars Tclc-caialog building, 
so 1 drove there and asked an em- 
ployee. She lold mc thai the license 
bureau was still downtown. So, I 
drove downtown and found a sign on 
the door which read, "Moving near 
Scars building. Use New Haven 
branch until Sept. 22." 1 wasn't sure 
whether the sign meant Sept. 22. 
1992 or 1993, hut 1 assumed 1 had 
nmdca mistake. 

Day 2; I went back to Sears and 
easily found the license branch. 
Pleased that there was a parking 
space open near the entrance, I 
bounded gaily to ihc door and read 
that the branch closed on Wednes- 
days ai noon. Of course, il was 2 



CORRECTION 

In last week's Communicator 
(3/18/93), the last line of the Karen 
Garmiin story of sexual harassment 
was inadvertently dropped. The com- 
pleted quote should have said: "My 
advice to women is that if you feel at 
all uiicomfonable with a professor, 
have someone go with you and make 
sure ^c door stays open." 



p.m., and today wai Wednesday, So I 
decided to find the New Haven 
branch and see if il too was closed. I 
drove lo the ouiskiru. and looked for 
phone booths so I could look up the 
address, but. in New Haven, all of ihc 
phone books have been removed for 
your convenience. Eventually, 1 
found an indoor booth that hadn't 
been looted and wrote down the ad- 
dress: 925 Main Sircei. Of course. 
ihis address was now occupied by the 
New Haven Library. The librarian 
lold me the new address, and when I 
finally went there, I discovered it was 
indeed closed. I realized that the real 
goal 




ihcs 



agen- 



to 



tay 



ihead 
of the pub- 
lic. Under 
the possible 
supervision of CIA advisors, the li- 
cense bureau moves its headquarters 
yearly like a guerrilla camp eluding 
Sandinistas. 

Day 3: First I drove lo the nearby 
State Police station and showed a 
desk ofliccr my fonn. I was not sur- 
prised when he suggested it should 
be signed by the license bureau; that 
seemed to make sense. Armed with 
the knowledge that I was going to the 
right place with the righi form, I ar- 
rived at the Fort Wayne branch, I 
walked into a bureaucratic carnival 
of horrors. Some of these people may 
have been waiting for two or three 
generalions, But I had an edge over 



these veterans: 1 wasn't inbred and I 
still remembered why I was here. I 
muscled my way to a desk and pre- 
sented my form. The bureaucrat was 
both confused and frightened by the 
document. Three different bureau- 
crats played hot potato with ihe docu- 
ment until Ihe leader finally refused 
lo sign it. She said the Stale Police 
should sign it. I considered mailing 
my grandparents an assault rifle in- 
stead, but that would have been loo 

Instead, I drove to New Haven, but 

encountered Ihe same resistance. In 
my experience, the only skills of li- 
cense branch employees arc preter- 
tuilural reflexes (to photograph appli- 
cants in mid blink) and the artistic 
sense of Ihc best lighting lo accentu- 
ate facial blemishes. Look at yoiu* li- 
cense picture and you will agree. 
However, ihis bureaucrat did ac- 
knowledge that there are no emis- 
sions laws here, but was still too 
frightened lo sign the form. So. I 
asked her to call the New Haven Po- 
lice Department, explain Ihc form, 
and ask one of those fearless men to 
sign their fearless names lo it. They 
complied, and I walked out of New 
Haven triumphant. 

I wish 1 could say that public ser- 
vants aren't the lowest from of life, 
but viruses aren't technically alive. I 
later learned that there is another 
agency which deals solely with vehi- 
cle registration. Its last reported loca- 
somewhere downiown, but 
it may have moved or assumed an- 
other alias by 



A fun vacation-not for these two 



By Oebbi SUli 

I have ui and liiieoed lo Spring Break 
horror stories fox over a week now. Ii 
man have been real bad lo have lo slay 
in a hold in Georgia partying with your 
friends and meeting other students for a 
couple cutni days. I think I would have 
loved the trip to Florida lathcr than my 
Spring Break trip, the crip lo hell and 
back. 

My friend. Rebecca, invited me lo go 
10 New Yak and Massachusetts with hei 
lo visii friends. I agreed lo go w»d we left 
Ihc Friday aflei classes gol out We had a 
bta.st meeting new people and seeing a 
diffeieni pan of America ihat our friends 

When Friday of spring break finally 
rolled uound and we realized Uui we 
only has two more days wc decided thai 
partying the lost two nights would be juii 
fine. 

When we returned from dinner we 
henrd the news of ihe great bliiintd. 
"TWo to three feel of snow, no way" we 
ihoughL Aflcr many thoughts of what to 
do we decided to leave in the morning 
before i[ storied lo snow. Boy. did we 
call ihal one wrongl 

We goi up Saturday and left Massachu- 
setts around 8 a,m,, figuring we would be 
home by 10 thai night. We got on Ihc 



highway and it luncd snowing, real bad- 
Becky couldn't see wylhing. Trying lo 
pui cars was a bad idea. 

Mold 6 WIS our home for the nexl two 
nights. Sunday, when we planned on 
leaving. Pennsylvania closed all their 
highways. 1 c&amp;lled my parents and ihey 
wenl 10 the Motel 6 here in town to pay 



foTOI 



utofm 



and needed gas money lo go home. 

We hung in there, living on peanut bul- 
let and jelly sandwiches and 85 cent cans 
of Mountain Dew. 

We started oul again al 8 in the mcm- 
ing, expeciing lo be home by S thai 
nighL That's what wc ihoughL 

With all of the snow, slush, and waier 
on the highways u was difTiculi lo drive 
over 45 mph. sliding on ice patches as 
we went along. Wc stopped off ihe high- 
way to buy some windshield wiper fluid. 
When we got back on Ihe road again, il 
all started. Ten minutes after our stop. 
Rebecca slid on the ice and hit the guard 
rail. It didn't bang up hei cor thai much 
bui it was noticeable. 

After gciting out ihoughis logether, we 
look off again only lo get on the wrong 
highway. Quickly looking al the map we 
found a way to gel on the right rood. 

We were happy to see ihc 1-80 sign, bui 
sod lo sec a stale troopa nmng in trotii 
of the exiL Wc stopped and I jumped out 



of ihc car to sec whal wii gouig on. The 
cop told me 1-80 wis MiU ciowd and we 
would have lo drive lo Me and bnng il 
back up. three hoois om of our K^y. 

Fuiall)'. a sign thai said Ohio - 5 hours 
from home. We drove almost halfway 
though Ohio with no pcoblemi. Three 
hours away from home, we decided lo 
stop for gas and food. As 1 slopped on 
the c^it lamp so did the car. No joke, the 
cai just stopped running. 

Rebecca and I goi some Mp and look 
It to a service itaiion. They looied ai 
everything and couldn't find anything 
wrong with the car. We lai around for 3 
hours doing nothing. 

When ihcy gave u* Ihe bill for S54 they 
told us Ihcy didn't take out of stale 
cheeks. Wc didn'i have enough money 



bciw 



o otu 



wouldn't take Rebecca's bank cord. By 
Ihis lime Rebecca was in tears and I 
didn'l know whal lo say. Finally, I called 
her grandmolhcr for her charge card 
number so we could pay the bill and 
head hom^ 

Wc got on 10, the wrong way. After wc 
turned around we finally arrived in Foil 
Wayne al 1:30 a.m. Tuesday I was hap- 
py lo be home. Rebecca and I sal back 
and laughed ai everything thai had hap- 
pened in ihc past eighteen hours. 

So if you think you had il bad partying 
a couple aaa days, think again.

Scientists study all aspects of weather 



By Felicia Beechinf; 
Editor In chief 

"Everyone talks about Ihe weath- 
er, but no one doei anything about 
It," Mark TVain once said. 

Tliai used to be uue, bui now 
scioiiisis siudy the causes of weather 
in hopes of conuolling the damag- 
ing aspects - such as iiun-icancs 
and tornadoes. 

Have you ever thought about the 
uniqueness of weather? Do you know 
the scientific differences of drizzle, 
snow, and sicct? Find a dry place to 
sit. read on, and we'll fuid out about 
our spring and winter weather . 

Preelpilatlon is a scientific defini- 
tion of all forms of water falling from 
the sky to earth. Specifically, that 
means driz/le, rain, snow, sleet, and 
hall, but excludes fog. dew. and frost. 
Worldwide, only two forms of pre- 
cipitation occur routinely enough to 
be measured; rain and snow. Approx- 
imately 30 inches (760 mm) of pre- 
cipitation falls over the U,S, per year. 
Surprisingly, only 4 inches (100 



mm) of this precipitation is snow- 
fall. But consider that many 
weather reporting stations only re- 
ceive rain, others rain and snow, 
others mostly just snow, and in 
descn areas of the U.S.. hardly any 
kind of precipitation. 

Drizzle is a fine mist with drops, 
but the precipitation (water) conlcni 
is low- &lt; Imm of water/ hour. Rain 
is made up of condensed liquid cling- 
ing to panicles of dust in the clouds. 
Clouds are visible moisture - cither 
as droplets or ice crystals. It takes 
one million of these cloud droplets to 
become one raindrop! (Technically, 
it doesn't become a 'raindrop' until 
the liquid falls from the sky.) Rain 
is heavier than drizzle and is classi- 
fied as light (&lt;2,5 mm/hr,), moderate 
(2,8-7.6 mm/hr,), or heavy {&gt;7.6 
mm/hr.). Sleet is when raindrops 
freeze as they fall through the air. In 
contrast, hail is frozen ice chunks 
that fall directly from the clouds. 

Ironically, to learn how snow forms, 
we're going to have to start at the 
equator. Hot moist air rises to high 



Help save our worlcd 



We arc in tfouble! Pollution is cor- 
rupting the air wc breathe and the land

dwindling faster than imaginable. 

No one can deny thol our wondrous 
world is in crisis. Everyday the prob- 
lems grow and if wo do not act soon, 
ihcy will become inc-

Through articles filled 
with horrendous facts 
that should not be, and

to solve this crisis we, 
at the Communicator,

the danger our world

altitudes and begins to flow toward 
the North Pole in our hemisphere or 
to the South Pole in the southern 
hemisphere. This happens only be- 
cause the earth is rotating on its axis 
and causes the winds to move in a 
NE direction (SW direction down un- 
der). The farther north this hot moist 
air moves, the cooler ii becomes. As 
it cools. It begins to sink {around 
30»N latiiude) to the earth, but con- 
tinues on its trip to the North Pole, 
Meanwhile, cold anic air begins to 
head southward toward the equator. 
When these two opposite kinds of air 
meet - watch out! That is what caus- 
es clouds and storms to form. 

Snow always forms in clouds in 
freezing weather as six-sided or 
hexagonal shapes. For snowflake ex- 
perts, there arc 10 basic kinds of 
shapes listed with the International 
Snow Classification, The variations 
of these 10 categories are infinite. 
Snow varies in type, generally due to 
the percentage of precipitation in ii. 
"Powdery" snow is low in precipita- 
tion. It would take 7.6 million

snowflakes to accumulate a pound of 
this type. Powdery snow is not the 

kind you want to build a snowman 
widi. because it's low water comeni 
makes its sticky -ability low. 

The average snow in Indiana is 
about 10% water. A two foot 
snowdrift produces about 2 1/2 iiKh- 
es of melted water, with a cubic 
foot of snow containing &gt;10 million 
snowflakes! While we're ihinkmg 
mathematically about snow, can 
you guess how many melted 
snowflakes it would take to cover 
one acre of land a foot deep? 
Assuming that the water content 
is 10%. it would lake 
20.386,080.000,000 snowflakes. 
(Thai's 20+ trillion if you're hav- 
ing trouble reading dtat enormous 
number). 

Why is snowfall imponanl? In win- 
ter, snowfall provides groundcover 
to protect plants and insects from the 
extremities of harsh winter weather 
and it provides camouflage for some 
animals. In spring, run-off is envi-

Creating gender equality 



By Michael Ji»\% 
Spurts Editor 

One o[ \i&gt;e leading hmcs of the lui 
20 yean has been Eqiidl Righu. Il has 
tunned America upiidc-down looking 
lor answers lo itsquestioni. 

Religioiu, racial, and gender concerns 
have been noicd in Ihe work place, ai 
home, and al the local sports center. 

We have seen Ihe slow progress o( 
racial equality In compeiilion o( all lev- 
els: from Lilllc League lo piofesiional 
athletics. (Racial equality has in- 
povcd, but il still has a long way 
logo,) 

One concern gaining momcniuin in 
Ihe 1990's is Ihe issue of athletics gen- 
der e&lt;|ualiiy. 

Unfortunately, the answer lies in a 
thick fog of qucsiions that first need to 
be addressed. 

•Is Ihe United Slates of America 
ready lo accept in its heart women ath- 
letics the way it has always accepted 
their male counlciporis? 

There is n tendency to degrade the 
alhlclic capabilities of women athletes. 
A female athlete with any conviction to 
her sport will attest that many of Ihc 
American people do not always wel- 
come her ability. 

Instead, she is greeted with questions 
of her own sexuality. Not that it is any 
concern of the American people, but 
somehow it is a question thai, unfortu- 
nately, manifests itself during a 
woman's career. 

This is svrong. Our culture, however, 
has not been able to come to grips with 



thai mistake. True gender equality will 
not be won until our culture leams lo 
accept people for what they arc. not 
what they expect them lo be. 

*CBn a sport integrate a woman's 
play with a mans? 

One reason racial equality in aihleiics 
has advanced before gender equality is 
because racial equality can come 
through integration of play. 

For example, an Afro-American man 
and a white man can play on a team to- 
gether, because their ability is equal. 



The ball's 
in my court 



The same with an Afro-American 
woman and a white woman, 

Bui. no matter what the race, there 
becomes an 'ability gap' bciween men 






. It's iri 



thai 



sirongei physically. 

There is an accepted and expected 
segregation between male sports and 
female sports. How can gender equality 
come about if thai is so? 

One way is to create new sports that 
mix the abilities of men and women. 
Today, figure skating is one sport that 
calls for cooperation on that level. 

■Will the American people accept the 
mixing of genders to create equality? 

No. Professional baseball and football 
have become popular because of what 
they are. To change ihcm would change 
much of America's tradition. 

Gender equality is handicapped by iis 



inability lo inle^ate male and female 
athletes into one sport. 

"How then do you create gender 
equality? 

It can't be creaied. it just is. When 
people accept womens athletics for 
what ihey aic. then equality can be 
established. 

When a woman's hockey or soccer 
game is appTccjaied as much as a man's 
hockey or soccer game, then genders 
will become equal. 

Money and law can help ihis process. 
It is going to lake money to help en- 
dorse female spons, and laws to pro. 
vide a basis for equality. 

■How far away is America from real- 
izing this goal? 

Far far away. Bui the issue is ai least 
being tackled. The NCAA has estab- 
lished a committee to look into Ihe 
question on a coliegiaic level. 

There arc already loose goals of es- 
tablishing a 60-40 split between men 
and women sports. For every s\^ male 
alhtclcs there should be four women 
athletes. 

However, many other questions haunt 
the final verdict on gender equality. It 
will bo years beforu ihcy are all sorted 
out; but notice of the concern is at least 
a beginning.

RAISE A COOL 



Tri-State falls in three 



Dy Michael Bb&amp;s 
SporLs Editor 

The Vollcydons aticr a grueling 
Spring Break full of matches received 
sometime off last week to practice for 
the upcoming IPFW Spring Fling. 

Their break was broken only once 
when TVi-Siatc University came into 
town on Tuesday Mar, 23, lo lace the 
Vollcydons al Ihc Hilliard Gates 
Sports Ccnler, 

The Vollcydons were quick to get 
back to their winning ways by thrash- 
ing Tti-Slalc in three games; 15-0, 15- 
8, and 15-1. 

Coach Amie Ball mixed things up a 
little bit by changing Ihc starling ros- 
ier and working two different teams 
out on the floor. 

In games one und three, the Volley- 
don roster consisted of Lloy Ball, Pe- 
ter Kujak. Chad Blaichlcy, Craig 
Collins .Brad Pricdilis, and Felipe 
Ralat. 

The team soundly beat Tti-Staie in 
both games with solid defense and a 
strong allack led by Collins, PriediUs, 
and Kujak. 

"We've been having lough practices 



and we wanted to come out, play 
hani, and execute," said Kujak. 

In gome Iwo, Coach Ball went with 
a second lineup of: Jason Slang. Nor- 
man Almodovar, Kevin Mullcrsman. 
Qucniin Spiegel. Raul Papalco. and 
Scot Laucr. 

Almodovar led ihe team popping his 
kills wiih lighting speed, bui both 
teams were plagued with service er- 
rors and attack errors ihai slowed ihc 
pace of the game, 

The Vollcydons will play their last 
home games for the '93 season starl- 
ing on Friday. Mar. 26 at Ihe IPFW 
Spring Fling. 

TTic Vollcydons will host three 
other Icams in the Tourney; Ball 
SiaiC. UC -Santa Barbara, and Loyola 
MaiymoimL 

On Friday, the team will face 
Loyola Marymount and on Saturday, 
the team will go up against UC- 
S ant a Barbara. Boih games begin al 
8:ISpm. 

On Sunday, the team will host the 
Mini Spring Inviiational. They will
