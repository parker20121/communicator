For the past s 
been reading with great a 
the column in the COMMUNICATOn 
entitled "As I Sec It." Having 
been subjected for the past four 
moalhs to the narrow-minded, opin- 
ionated vioivs of this "Orol aobcrls- 
in residence," wc couldn't help 
but Feel that, surely, in the year 
1972, ao real person could actually 
have allowed his rcligous beliefs 
to remain so far buck in the Stone 
Age. 

We began to believe thai Murk 
Souder must be a pseudonym for the 
leader of some fanatical, right-wing, 
religious cull. However, lust week, 
much to our dismay, we discovcd 
that Mark Souder, the person, is a 
reality. Aside from Souder'a obvi- 
ous failure to recognize religion as 
a highly personal subiecl, he iiImd 
fails lo realise Ihut not evcrvone 



:epls. 



e lat 



the myths and fairy tales perpetrated 
ia the Bible. 

In addition, Souder doesn't seem 
to understand ihal (as much as he 
hates to admit it) sexual morality 
is also a highly personal subject 
and his use of [he Bible as the basis 

dity ihun the use of Playboy. 

This brings ua to one fiaal qucs- 
lioa. Out of the thousands of stu- 
dents ut l-PU, what qualifies Mark 
Souder, above all others, to use ihc 
COMMUNICATOR as ^ sounding- 
board to pass moral judgements on 
the actions of others? He is cer- 
tainly entitled to his opinions und 
beliefs, but a college newspaper is 
.definitely not the place for them. 
Mark says that wc will bum for 
eleraily in Hell for defying ihe di- 
vine teachings of Souder. But 
we're not worried. You'll come see 
us once in a »i,ile, won't vou Mark?

Poit-campaign commenU 

Dear Editors, 

"You caa't have a clean election! 
It just can't be donel" These 
were some of the cries heard (or 
the past two weeks. The AAA 
Parly had three goals: I. To have 
o clean, open election 2. To 
inleccsl students inio voting, voting 
for their choice, but voting. 3. To 
provide a better student govern- 
ment for the coming year. 

The members of the party looked 
at the programs and the proble-ns 
on this campus. Research was 
done on who and how many had 
voted in past elections, und a 
goal of 25% was set for student 
voters. Several sluiiants were 
interviewed far the position of 
student body president iiad vice- 
president, including the opposition 
candidule. Strategy culled for a 
peak election iatcresi on Monday, 
Tuesday und Wednesday uf this 
week. 

■IVre were a few areas thai 
were not fully considered by the 
candidates: Corruption, Mud- 
Slinging and Slander. With the 
large amount of apnihy on this 
campus, it is indeed surprising 
to find that so many students and 
organizations were willing to "aid" 
in the election with undesired 
material. Parly members stood firm 
on their goal: no harm to any per- 
son, or to any party during cam- 
paigning. For some students, this 

involved. The party platform of 

fashion thot much could be read 
into each item. This had to be 
done in order not to offend, and 

An open, clean election is not 
an unreal goal. This was accom- 
plished. Student apathy was at- 
tacked this week. Percentages 
tell only part of the story, Twenty- 
five pereeni of 6,000 students was 
a little unrealistic at first, but 
it could be aecomplinhcd. Ilic 
biggest drawbock is the f,ia thiU 



we liove 91% many pari lime and 
evening students that do not "feel" 
us though they art "part" of ihe 
student body. Perhaps campaigns 
of the future should be more awnre 
of this fact when slating their 

The voles have been casi, the 
wianers announced, and now 
wc look forward to the future year. 
I'hc new President has a lol on 
his shoulders. Porbups the two 
parlies can now work together to 
provide the student body with ihe 
best representation. Let's keep a 
few plulformd around, sg ihni nenl 
year we all con sec whui has been 
accomplished hy our votes. Con- 
gnitulations tu ihc student body! 
Wc hope Ihev will be the winners 
in Ihe year lo co,„e.

sircxyud the need to return Ameri- 
ca's [ocus lo the home scene rat- 
her thnn the international Front. As 
Ilarvcy recalled, America once 
WUH "n shining example" that 
''mindiid its own business so well 
as to be the lighthouse of the

Harvey told the crowd, "Uncle 
Sum has been trying lo carry the 
worM an your shoulders" with the 
result that "the poor nationa, with 
one eticcplion, are poorer than be-

Originally somcwhot of a "hawk' 
in regard to the Vietnamese War, 
Ilarvcy ndmitled that he has 
i^hungcd his stance to advocate a 



clumping down upcn South \ icl- 
num under the present administra-

petuation of d dictator anywhere i&gt;&gt; 
not worth one American life." 
America will ''eventually have to

by design— before we ore drained!" 

The forces of Communism can't 
be ToreBtalled, llurvcy mainluined, 
by propping up a regime such as 
Ibatof Thicu. An "irrefutuble 
fact" genemlly not r^oli/cd by 
Americans is that "Communism is

and hence cannot be bought off
