By MICHELE R. SHAFFER 
Managing Editor 

Concerns were raised about the 
reappointment of management for the 
IPFW affirmative action officer at the 
Fort Wayne Faculty Senate meeting 
Monday. 

Michael Downs, chairman of the 
department of political science, 
presented a resolution to the senate for 
consideration which expressed the 
faculty senate's disapproval of the 
change in reporting lines for the af- 
firmative action officer Previously, 
the affirmative action officer reported 
to the Chancellor's Office. With the 
change, the affirmative action officer 
reports to John Ulmer. dean of 
students. 

Donna Middleton, the IPFW af- 
firmative action officer, was 
unavailable to comment. 

Down's resolution, which in part 
stated "the affirmative action officer 
should report to the chancellor," was 
passed by the senate. 

In the absence of Acting Chancellor 
Edward Nicholson, Joanne Lantz, 
chair of the department of 
psychological sciences, addressed the 
faculty's concerns. Lantz (old the 
faculty that Nicholson explained to 
her that the dean of students' office 
(student affairs) would have the added 
responsibility of minority affairs, an 
umbrella which covers affirmative 
action and minority recruitment. 

However, according to Nicholson, 
Ulmer's added responsibilities would 
include overseeing veteran affairs, 
handicapped services and hispanic 
affairs, in addition to minority affairs 
and affirmative action. 

According (o Downs, the duty of 
affirmative action is loo important to 
be overshadowed by other duties. 

"The affirmative action officer is so 

nportant a function that it ought not 



to be mixed with other functions which 
have their own demands lo make on 
the chancellor," said Downs, Monday. 
As dean of students, Ulmer is 
presently responsible for overseeing 
the 70-plus student organizations at 
IPFW. According lo Nicholson, 
Ulmer would now be responsible for 
two offices, the student affairs ad- 
ministration and the office which 
would include the affirmative action 
and minority affairs functions, among 
others. 

Downs also stated that at other 
campuses the affirmative action of- 
ficer is considered such an important 
function that the affirmative action 
officer is usually a staff member in the 
chancellor's office. Historically, at 
IPFW, that is not the case. 

John Camaghi, vice chancellor for 
financial affairs, affirmed Monday the 
affirmative action officer reported to 
the assistant to the chancellor when 
Joseph Giusti was chancellor. When 
Nicholson was appointed acting 
chancellor, he changed the reporting 
line so the officer would report straight 
lo the chancellor . 

This coincides with the affirmative 
action document of Indiana Univer- 
sity, according to Downs. He said the 
document specifically directs the 
officer to report directly to the 
chancellor. 

Nicholson, however, doesn't think 
the change should make that much of a 
difference "Well she's really repor- 
ting to a person who reports to the 
chancellor," he said. "So at the same 
time, (the affirmative action officer) 
is working in a bigger office, with 
bigger resources." 

Nicholson also said he didn't think 
the change in supervision for the 
officer should be emphasized. "The 
change I want lo emphasize is that the 
change is in furtherance of our C"~ 



mitment to minority groups and 
women and affirmative action," 
said Nicholson. 

The change for the affirmative 
action office came at the same time 
another move was made. The Office of 
counseling, Testing and Placement, 
which reported lo Ulmer in student 
services, now reporls to the office of 
Academic Service. 

Downs said Monday he did not think 
the move was handled properly, nor 



did it make sense 

"It (the office of affirmative action) 
ought not be a consolation prize Tor 
other department heads for having 
other departments removed from his 
department." said Downs, in 
reference lo the coinciding move of Ihe 
counseling*; testing and placement 
office. "To me, this does not make 
administrative sense. It may make 
political sense, but not administrative

Department moved to academic services 



By MICHELE R. SHAFFER 
Managing Editor 

"We have no leader," said Marian 
Adair, director of the Office of 
Counseling, Testing and Placement. 

Adair was referring to the change of 
supervision for her department, a 
move which coincides with a similar 
move for Ihe office of affirmative 
action. 

Adair's office, which previously 
reported to student services, headed 
by John Ulmer, dean of students, now 
reports directly lo the office of 
academic services. That office is 
presently under the guidance of O. 
Franklin Kenworthy. who is leaving 
IPFW this summer. No replacement 
has yet been named for Kenworthy's 
position. 



Adair said she thought the change 
was made in her department to 
coordinate all related services, such as 
the registrar's office, student 
academic counseling and admissions. 
It was done, said Adair, "I think in an 
effort, enrollment management wise, 
lo make sure all services were coor- 
dinated." Adair said the departments 
such as the registrar's office, student 
academic counseling and admissions 
were originally under the office of 
student services However, those 
departments were pulled out years 
ago, and the only faction left was that 
of counseling, testing and placement. 

Adair said she thought the move took 
effect immediately, although she has 
"seen no paperwork" on the change. 
She said she has been told, though. 

Adair, who has been with IPFW 



since 1978, thinks the change will 
benefit her department. She said, 
overall, it would likely bring "more 
credibility" to her office and help 
coordinate future planning. "In ad- 
dition," said Adair, "the chancellor 
philosophically realizes the im- 
portance of placement." 

Adair added that the change would 
bring improvements in her depart- 
ment. She said the office of counseling, 
testing and placement hopes to offer 
cooperatives and internships to 
students in the future. She said they 
are also working on a freshman 
orientation program "that lasts 
several months. " 

"Enrollment management is really 
both recruitment and retaining the 
students," said Adair. 



Edward Nicholson, acting chan- 
cellor, agreed thai the change would 
bring growth for the office of coun- 
seling, testing and placement 

Nicholson, like Adair, said the move 
was made to bring all the departments 
concerned with enrollment 
management together. 

"The reason is that it used to all be 
logether," said Nicholson In ex- 
plaining why the office of counseling, 
testing and placement now reports to 
the department of academic services. 

"(We want to) begin career and 
academic counseling as soon as a 
student gels into the system," said 
Nicholson. "So, when a student decides 
on a major, we can begin giving him 
information on that major or Job or 
graduate school." 



America stretches out its hands to help its own 



By RALPH HAINES 
Staff Writer 

Sunday, May 25, 1986, at 2 p.m. EST 
13 p.m. EDT), Hands Across America 
will link six to ten million people in a 
continuous line stretching from New 
York to Los Angeles, according lo the 
movers and backers of what is being 
publicized as the longest if not the 
largest, media event of the decade. 
They are depending, to a great extent, 
on college and university students lo 
make it happen. 

The immensity of this project comes 
into focus when one realizes that 
between 2'j and IWi percent of the 
population of the United States must 
participate if it is to succeed It is 
estimated the population of nor- 
theastern Indiana, including Fort 
Wayne, would be required just to cross 
Indiana. The 4137-mile line will zigzag 
across 16 slates and the District of 
Columbia in a pattern intended to 
bring H within 60-70 percent of the U.S. 
population. 

The declared purpose of the event, 
which is headed by Fred S. Droz, of 
Adler Droz. Inc.. national project 
director and Marty Rogol, executive 
director of USA for Africa, Is to 
"educate the public about hunger and 
homelessness in America and to raise 
approximately $100 million to combat 
Ihese problems " Ten percent of the 
funds raised is tagged for emergency 
relief; 40 percent for development of 
farmer's co-ops. rehabilitation centers

Professors rooted in our memory 



Faculty honored 

By LILLIAN LYON 
Copy Editor 

The Purdue University Board of 
Trustees have granted two IPFW 
professors the emeritus status, an 
honorary title given to retired 
professors. 

Belty L. Funck, retired associate 
professor of nursing, and Fred R. 
Gideon, associate professor of elec- 
trical engineering technology, were 
honored at a retirement party last 

Funck, who has been at fPFW for 
over 16 years, retired after the end of 
last semester. Before coming to IPFW, 
she worked at Parkview Hospital. 

One of Funck's contributions to 
IPFW during her years of service was 
in the development and im- 
plementation of the college medical 
laboratory. 



Fred R. Gideon retires at the end of 
this semester. He has been employed 
at IPFW since 1968, and has worked at 
Purdue University, Madison-Marion 
High School, and Elmhurst High 
School. 

A major project Gideon ac- 
complished during his teaching years 
was in 1964, when he assisted Inter- 
national Harvester in developing an 
apprentice training program in 
electronics. 

Dean to leave 

By STACY SCHAAB

sciences at St Louis University, where 
he completed his undergraduate work 
in chemistry arid mathematics

served IPFW in many ways. Heserved 
as president of the Northeast Indiana 
Section of the American Chemical 
Society and as a member of the 
steering committee for an Indiana task 
force on science education, lo name 
only two of many, 

Bundschuh also served as assistant 
dean of the system-wide graduate 
school for Purdue University from 1W1 
to 1984.

Departments shuffled 



i /i" current administration has 
recently been shuffling around the 
control of departments prior to the 
appointment of a new chancellor 

These moves are being made without 
much input from the affected 
departments The people who are being 
moved should know what changes would 
be best for their offices. However, these 
people were never consulted, something 
happening with increasing frequency at 
IPFW over the last few years. 

Other examples of these sudden moves 
are the change in reporting lines for the 
office of counseling, testing and 
placement. This office, directed by 
Marian Adair, which in the past has 
reported lo student services, will now 
report to the office of academic services. 

There are a couple of problems with 
the changes in Adair's department 
First, doesn't student services imply aid 
to students? Secondly, does not 
counseling, testing and placement also 
imply aid to students? These two 
functions should be placed together 
Thirdly, it would seem that with the 
change, Adair's office might need 
considerable guidance concerning any 
changes coming with the move. But they 
are getting lost in the shuffle 

A second example of a major change 
that went unannounced was the change 
in reporting for the athletics 
development office from the 
chancellor's office lo the office of 
financial affairs, a department headed 
by John Carnaghi, vice chancellor for 
financial affairs. This change is a move 
that was decided after the former 
director of athletic department 
development, Carl Bickley, died— in 
January. The faculty senate just 



discovered this change at the faculty 
senate meeting Monday — four months 
later. 

But it still seems the major upset 
around here is the change affecting the 
affirmative action office. The faculty 
senate opposed the move so strongly, 
they passed a resolution which almost 
condemned the change. The resolution, 
authored by Michael Downs, chair of the 
department of political science, said the 
affirmative action officer should have 
remained in its present position — 
reporting directly to the chancellor's 
office. 

At the core of all these moves are two 
factors very disturbing lo many people 
in the IPFW community — students as 
well as faculty. First, it was made before 
a new chancellor was appointed. Since 
the new chancellor will presumably take 
over next fall, if one is indeed appointed 
soon, he might have his own ideas on the 
best departmental organization 
Secondly, the faculty was never 
consulted. The administration 
seemingly thought so highly of its 
judgement and wisdom it evidently did 
not see a need to keep consultation lines 
open This problem was also voiced by 
faculty members at their senate meeting 
Monday. 

Maybe our new chancellor, who we 
assume will begin work next fall (if the 
process is running "as usual" as they 
keep reporting) can fix things. 
Hopefully, our new chief executive 
officer will be more aware of the 
importance of going to faculty senate 
meetings, addressing faculty concerns 
and consulting them on important 
decisions that affect IPFW operations.

Harbor Arbor disaster 



Imagine people in the amphitheatre 
outside the patio at Walb — not as it 
looks today, inhabited only by the lone 
leaves swirling around in the spring 
breeze -f? but alive with people enjoying 
themselves. 

imagine these people packed together, 
elbow-to-armpit, nodding in time to the 
beat of a free rock concert. 
; Imagine people coming from as far 
away as Ohio in response to Harbor 
Arbor Days events advertised on the 
radio 

This is the festive atmosphere 
reported by students who crowded onto 
camnus to see such bands as Kansas and 
KEO Speedwagon in the 1970's. All roads 
leading into the campus were choked 
with traffic — in an atmosphere 
reminiscent of the Three Rivers 
Festival 

Anyone who was on campus last week 
(during Harbor Arbor Days! can attest 
to the fact that the only time of the day 
the roads were choked with traffic was 
when classes were changing and that no 
big name bands were on hand to 
entertain revelers. 

The tradition of Harbor Arbor Days 
has deteriorated significantly in recent 
years The most commonly cited cause 
(or such occurrences is apathy. By now, 
this term should be very familiar to 



IPFW students — it's been used about us 
often in recent years. 

Unfortunately, we may deserve the 
label this time. 

Students now rush off to part- or full- 
time jobs immediately after class This, 
unfortunately, is an economic necessity. 
Many students go off campus to seek 
entertainment when they have some 
spare time. 

For the past few years, studehts"ahd 
administrators involved with Harbor 
Arbor Days have talked of phasing out 
this once popular tradition. Regardless 
of what is planned, attendance is never 
what is hoped for. Disappointment 
prevails. Money is lost. 

This cannot continue. It is time to 
create new traditions, Why keep 
spending hard earned money and weeks 
of planning on something that 
consistently fails? 

Instead of planning a week of 
mediocre events, one large well- 
publicized event would be sufficient. One 
suggestion is to engage a promoter who 
could bring in a non-cancelling, big- 
name concert to this campus. If properly 
planned, this event could save the 
tarnished reputation of Harbor Arbor 
Days. 

Imagine Hundreds of IPFW students 
together in one place. 



As another academic year 
comes to a close so does 
another volume or The 
Communicator. 

With the conclusion of 
Volume XVII comes some 
staff changes. 

Johnette Toplisek, editor- 
in-chief, will graduate in 
May. Replacing Toplisek 
will be Michele Shaffer, 



presently managing editor 

Filling the position 01 
managing editor will be the 
present copy editor, Lillian 
Lyon. 

Taking over the position of 
copy editor will be Gina 
Jones, a staff writer and 
junior majoring in ac- 
counting. 
Kathleen Greven, en- 



tertainment editor; Bart 
Akeyu, sports editor; Mark 
New, photo editor ; Mike 
Linville, Illustrator, will 
remain in their present 
positions. 

Also earning new titles this 
semester are Tony 
Dunaway, Julie Magsamen 
and Mary Harmon, who 
have been named chief 



reporters. 

To earn the chief reporter 
title, a staff writer must be 
on the staff for at least one 
semester, write for the 
newspaper on a constant 



and 



show

How can you tell it's 
nearly summer on campus? 
There are many ways, but 
the most obvious sign ot all 
are the sounds of the nail- 
biting, lip-gnawing, and 
teeth-mashing of those 
students, however many lor 
lew • worried about finals. 

Finals?! Yes, Don't panic, 
though. There are still 11 
days to study before finals 



week begins on May 5. 

The two best places to 
sludy at IPFW are the

Commencement questions 
answered for graduates 



By LINDA SOUERS 

Graduation is nearly here. It is an 
exciting time but also a confusing 
experience for first time grads. 
Following are some of the most 
commonly asked questions and answers 
about commencement: 

Q: When is commencement? 

A: Commencement will be on 
Wednesday, May 14, at 7:30 p.m., in the 
Memorial Coliseum. 

Q: What time should candidates be 
there? 

A": Candidates should be robed and 
ready to assemble at 6:45 p.m. 

Q: How many people may I invite? 

A: As many as you like. The seating is 
unlimited and unreserved 

Q: How long does the ceremony last? 

A: Approximately two hours. 

Q: May 1 have whatever color tassel I 
want? 

A: No. The tassel color is dictated by 
your division or school. 

Q: How do candidates line up? 

A: Signs will be posted and candidates 
should go to the sign that indicates their 
division and line up in alphabetical 
order. 



Q: Who decides which candidates 
receive an honor cord? 

A. Generally speaking, for Purdue, 
you must be in the top 10 percent of your 
class and have a grade point index of 5.3 
or higher For 1U, each department or 
school sets its own standards when 
determining who will receive honors. 

Q: When do I find out if I will receive 
an honor cord? If I am receiving one, 
how do I get it? 

A: If you are to receive an honor cord, 
you will be sent a letter that tells you so. 
The honor cords will be given out at the 
Chancellor's Reception for the 
Graduating Class on Saturday, May 10, 
at 8 p.m. in the Walb Union Ballroom. 
However, you must participate in the 
graduation ceremony to receive an 
honor cord. 

If you have any other questions, please 
consult the information sheet included 
with your cap and gown. If your 
questions still remain unanswered, call 
the office of academic ceremonies, 481- 
6460.

cerned," she said, "the only 
things that really succeed on 
this earth are people who 
aren't like the norm, people 
who rise above negativism, 
and people who know their 
uniqueness and market it to 
the hilt." 

Dispensing advice based 
on her experiences, she said 
she knows this advice will 
work for others, because it's 
worked for her. 

"I'm not a duplication of 
worn-out self-help theories," 
she said. "I don't read 
anybody else's poetry, ad- 
vice or (current) research 
on the topic. What I'm 
saying, I've lived — either 
through joy or pain and 
found out how it works." 

Some of these tried-and- 
true techniques Lybrand 
suggested for the successful 
job interview include 
stretching prior to the in- 
terview to ensure a more 
relaxed posture. She also 
suggested readying the voice 
by engaging in some kind of 
vocal exercises or humming 
to limber up the vocal cords. 

Upon entering the office, 
she suggested that you sit in 



confident manner: head 
held high and making eye 
contact with those in your 
field of vision "If you don't 
know your value, they don't 
need you." 

After the interview be- 
gins, she said to be sure 
and ask some questions of 
the interviewer to indicate 
an interest in the company. 
She added that most 
prospective employers will 
ask the applicants some 
questions about themselves 
— so have an answer ready 
Do not hem and haw around 
and risk appearing to be a 
wishy-washy person. 

One danger in this 
situation exists for many 
people, however It's not that 
they don't have anything to 
say, it's thai they don't know 
when to stop. The point is to 
appear to be self-confident, 
not egotistical, so learn how 
to curb your conversation. 

While you're sitting up 
straight, maintaining eye 
contact and engaging in a ' 
moderate amount of self- ( 
disclosure, be sure to J 
communicate honestly. 
■ "The worst thing a person 
can do in an interview is go , 
in and try to be something 1 
they aren't," she stressed, 
"They might get the job and 
be forced into living a lie for 
Iherest of their life."

Your Art Supply Headquarters! 



By M. KATHLEEN 
CREVEN 

Features Editor 
As any student on this 
campus knows, next week is 
what we all look forward to 
at the end of each semester. 
That chance lo put down onto 
paper or computer cards all 
that we've absorbed in the 



last 16 weeks Yes.i 



Next week, all courses are 
scheduled to meet for a two 
hour meeting. The instructor 
may use this period for a 
final exam or as a regular 
class meeting. If you're 
having a written final, be 



sure to double check on the 
site — it may not be held in 
the same classroom you've 
had class in this semester. 

Any student who is 
scheduled to take more than 
two exams in one day or who 
has a conflict of exams may 
contact the instructors of 
those classes to have one of 



the exams rescheduled. 

Be sure to consult the table 
below to double check for 
any such conflicts. It's (o 
your advantage to talk to 
your instructors about 
conflicts as soon as humanly 
possible so that you still 
stand a chance to do your 
best next week. Good luck!

Bodines switch to setter a big success 



By TONY DUNAWAY 
SI aff Writer 

In only his second season 
of volleyball. Phil Bodine 
has assumed the role of 
setter, the focal point of 
every volleyball team. The 
6'3" sophomore feels he has 
come a long way, bul he is 
the first lo point out he still 
has much to learn 

Bodine was an outside 
hitter his first year with the 
Volieydons and he said, 
■'The switch to setter is a 
very demanding move. The 
hardest thing lo learn is 
attitude, you must always 
remain positive and upbeat. 
If we're losing I can never 
hang my head and if I make 
a mistake I cannot show any 
frustration. The setter is the 
team leader and everyone 
looks to him for that 
leadership." 



Teammate Loren Gebert 

described Undine, "He is 
very intense on the court. He 
■ mi- a great setter 
and .is the quarterback of 
our learn lias become the 
type of leader we needed this 



"He can go as far in 
(his sport as he puts 
his mind to. " 

Coach Arnie Ball 



Bodine gives much of the 
credit for bis rapid im- 
provement to Coach Arnie 
Ball; "The man is a walking 
encyclopedia on volleyball. 
Coach gels involved with 
everyone and his door is 
always open lo all of us. I 




"Phil has an awful lot of 
athletic ability." says Coach 
Ball, "he can go as far in this 
sport as he puts his mind to." 

In a recent match against 
the University of California- 
San Diego, Bodine had a 
season-high 82 assists and 
may possibly be in line for 
another team award like the 
Most Improved Player 
award he received in the 1985 
campaign. 

The 15th ranked 

Volieydons ended their 
season with a loss and a win 
to finish the season at 15-13. 



Last Friday Gebert had 25 
kills and Bodine 15 assists as 
the Volieydons fell to Ohio 
State 15-11, 6-15, 2-15. 15-11, 
and 6-15 in the Midwestern 
Intercollegiate Volleyball 
Association Tournament. 

On Saturday, Jay Gold- 
steyn notched eight kills and 
Bodine had 16 assists as the 
Volieydons won the con- 
solation match 15-4, 15-7, and 
15-6 over Hardin- 

Simmons. 

Gebert, a senior, and 
Goldsteyn, a freshman were 
named to MIVA All- 
Conference team.
