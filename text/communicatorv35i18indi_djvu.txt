Previous to the suspension, students, faculty an. 
staff could cash a persona) check or paycheck up t&gt; 
$50. 



"They were suspended because our accounts were 
running in a negative balance." said Michalec. 

In other words, checks were bouncing. 

Michalec doesn't attribute the increase in bad 
checks to an increase in fraud; rather, the increase 
probably came from an October federal policy called 
"Check 21," making checks clear faster. 

Now, instead of it taking up to a week for a check 
to clear, funds were debited hetween U4 and 48 hours 
alter the check was received. 

Students, faculty or staff who "floated" a persona! 
check by depositing ilu- funds necessary for it to 
clear a few days alter writing it suddenly found their 
accounts reading "insufficient." 

Those whose checks didn't clear were still given a 
10-day notice before heing sent to collections, accord- 



ing to Mkhalec, so honest mistakes could be forgiven 

When Michalec. Vice Chancellor Walt ftranson and 
Comptroller Mark I r.mkc reviewed the policy and saw 
the negative balances, ihey decided the policy was 
being abused. 

"I don't think we should have an account available 
that students, stall, faculty think they can, more or 
less, lake out a lone, term loan," Michalec said. 

Michalec mentioned on campus alternatives to 
the service, such as the AIM. She uses the on-campus 
IU Credit Union now that the services have been sus- 
pended. 

There is hope, for the check cashing policy, liow-

i Indiana Reading Corps, helps 
refugee children learn to read while

It's Saturday morning. The hallways of a small apartment com- 
plex are mostly quiet, except for Room 120, where the Indiana 
Reading Corps has bunkered in. For some newly immigrated 
Burmese children, this room is an educational last stand. 

Inside, Chai has finished her homework and wants to read a 
book. She picks a small yellow one and brings it back to the table. 
She tries reading the tide. 

"A..." 

After a pause, Summer Brannon, her tutor, starts to sound out 
the next word. 

"Spa. ..ax..." Brannon says, her pen following the letters as she 
pronounces them. 

"Spar..." Chai follows along, 

"ka...ling..." Brannon finishes. 

"Sparkling." They say together. 

After a little more help from Brannon, Chai reads the title. 

"A Sparkling Chrisrr.!.!'. Ivy." she vi\s 

Chai is 9 years old and only in the first grade. 

Brannon is an education major at IPFW, and she was recruited 
by Kyaw Soe, the Program Coordinator with Indiana Reading 
Corps (IRC) at IPFW. Soe has been all over campus and the com- 
munity, looking for volunteers to read to "at-risk" children, such

human evolution. 

More than 30 dental and skeletal 
fossil remains of nine Ardipithecus 
ramidus individuals were unearthed 
at the Gona Study Area of Afar in 
northern Ethiopia. According to 
argon isotope dating these fossil are 
4.3 to 4.5 millions years old 

A. ramidus was first discovered 
in 1994, by a group of paleoanthro- 
pologists in Aramis and Middle 
Awash sites of Ethiopia. A. ramidus 
is presumed to be the first homi- 
nid genus, making it a link between 
early humans and chimpanzees. 
The main distinction of the hominid 
and its decedents was their ability to 
walk upright. 

However, up until this most recent 
discovery, there was not enough 



Uiat will likely indicate how A. ramidus walked. 

As Lawrence Kuznar Ph.D., professor of 
anthropology at IPFW, said the "discovery of 
fossils from below the waist is what makes this 
find significant, because they will probably show 
that hominids were bipedal early in evolutionary

Daniels would like IU and other public state 
hold steady and receive the same 
amount of state funding ihey received two years 
ago. 

A slight di lie rem e &lt;&gt;i opinion, sti to speak. 

The incoming battle over Indiana's two-year 
state budget, which will kind everything from the 
Department of Corrections to Medicaid, from 
cial services to transportation, will become a bat 
tie over funding for Indiana'-- public universities 
As ilu* state tries to slow spending in an attempt 
to balance the budget and lacerate the st

consider to be adequate funding for the

eral Assembly to allocate SI billion for the uni- 
versity, represent ini; an &gt;8&lt;i million increase from 
the current budget in state funds. But such an in- 



cluding all levels ril 'public education.

vilh Daniels sometime this week to dis- 
cuss funding concerns for the university. 

"President Herbert recognizes that the state 
is facing serious liscal problems." Maiintyresald, 
adding Herbert "appreciates that Gov. Daniels 
is trying to minimize the impact on both K-12 
schools and higher education." 

About one quarter of IU's $2.1 billion op- 
erating budget is provided by state government. 
Although be is noi seeking money for new or ex-

"lU'sresean Ii acini lies, especially in the life 
sciences, are helping to spark economic growth

The lobbying process has 
been called a check on the rep- 
resentative system, a way to 
make individual voices heard. 

"It (lobbying) is a means 
ni" |&gt;,,rt it ip.iiitig in the process 
of self-government. Privateciti- 
zens can get involved In lobby- 
ing for issues that are important 
to them and, indeed, have a say 
in the policies that impact on 
them. It's important for deci- 
sion-makers to know where 

sues. The only way they can 
know that is if they are told by 



access to the decision-makers. 
Individuals and/or groups that 
use these tactics are usually 
connected into the decision- 
making network. They spend 
time working and socializing 
with legislators and other in- 
fluential people in the public 
affairs arena." This type of lob- 
bying is often done by profes- 
sional lobbyists. 

There are many different 
organizations and companies 
working closely with legislators 
to further their respeclive agen- 
das. The Governmental Rela- 
tions Department of Indiana 
University is a group that advo- 
cates for Indiana University and 
higher education in general. 

"By working from a col- 
lective approach, our goal is to 
make all public policy officials 
(that aie responsible for appro- 
priations to the university and 
policy development affecting 
higher education) to under- 
stand how their decision mak- 
ing has an impact on the future 



of higher education in the state 
of Indiana," said Deborah Sib- 
bitt. director for Hoosiers for 
Higher Education, a division of 
the IU Governmental Relations 
Department.

'outsider' tactics are employed. 
These tactics usually involve 
creating awareness among the 
general public and relies quite 
heavily on the media to get a 
message out," said Miller. This 
strategy is more of a grass-roots 
effort of the people. 

This type of lobbying in- 
cludes writing to your legislator

Elections reveal spirit of Iraqis during occupation 



though it took extraordi 
bring the event to pass. 

The Associated Press reported on 
Sunday that Iraqi vixrrs could hear the sounds 
of explosions in the distance as they waited 
to vote. And once they voted, their finger was 
stained with purple ink, dearly separating those 
who had decided m pankipaie from those who 
abstained. 

The grand experiment— democracy — is 
now taking pl,t&lt; c in die Middle East. 

As countless annoying bumper stickers 
remind you, such freedoms aren't free. 

And whether you support the current cam- 
paign tendency to label Iraq .1 "quagmire" and 
pull out of the counlry as quickly as possible, it 
must be acknowledged thai America has invest- 
ed an incalculable ,1111011m as soldiers and civil- 
ians continue to be killed in bombings. 



lust on Sunday, 44 people [nine of that total 
were attackers) died as rebels attempted to 
disrupt the polling process, according to a 
Associated Press report. 

Thus far, 1,559 American soldiers have died 
in the Iraqi campaign (according to MilitaryCity. 
com, which keeps a running total of the 
American casualties). 

The number of Iraqis is much higher. 

In the face of such numbers, despite the 
violence and fear, an election took place on 
Sunday. 

Would you be willing to risk your life to go 
and vote? 

Americans can't even imagine what it would 
be like to live through the kind of danger that 
the voters faced in Iraq. Would we have stayed in 
the polling place if we heard explosions? 

In an era of such noise from the screeching 



for democracy was the simple act of going to 

With the reports of fear came reports of the 
sheer will of the Iraqi people to vote — some of 
the more elderly were carried to polling sta- 
tions, according to the Associated Press, and 
Reuters News Service reported stories of Iraqis 
smiling, cheering and dancing. 

It goes without saying that this election will 
not solve any problems in the handling of Iraq— 
in fact, it will most likely create even more 
difficulties as the Iraqis undertake a long and 



difficult t 

Now that an election has taken place, the calls 
to bring home American troops will become 
stronger (and rightly so). 

Just to vote, indeed. Regardless of the coming 
adversity, Sunday should be marked as a symbol 
of the unfailing ability ol a nation to rise up and 
try to make things better for themselves and 
their children. 



Howard Dean: Sign of the Times 



Casey at the Bat 

By Katie Casey 
kecasey@ipfwcommunicator.org 



Howard Dean is nwv tin* (rumrunner 10 win 
the Democratic National Chairmanship after 
receiving the support of slate Democratic Party 

leaders, according to an Assui iated Press report 
on Monday. 

The mere potentiality ih.it would allow How- 
ard Dean to have such an important post in ihe 
Democratic party is troubling, and is yet another 
sign ol their im rcasingh marginalized attitude. 

Rather than choose .1 leader who could more 
effectively woo the American public, the very 
icon of rabid liberalism, complete with the over- 
hyped scream, may have an official voice and im- 
portant part in the direction of the Democratic 

Few men have had their credibility as dam- 
aged as I lean, and whether or not the media un- 
fairly ruined his chances for president, the dam- 
age still stands and the question of his ability to 
negotiate Ins Lucn c.ihecl into question. I he wild 
frenzy of a rally cannot buoy a bill through Con- 
gress. 

While Dean's chairmanship would no 
doubt rally the Democratic base, in all reality ii 
would create more divisions than reconciliation 
in a country that is already (as the cliche goes) 
"deeply divided." 

However, talk of divisions has become so tired 
precisely because 11 is so immediate. The "red 
state/blue stale'' paradigm is so entrenched in 
the media's lexicon because 11 can be used to de- 
scribe anything, and really has no meaning. 

No matter what action the American public 
may lake, all (hat is necessary to provide "insight- 
ful" analysis is to hearken back to the particular 
color lhal conventional wisdom deems the slate. 

Why did Indiana voters choose t boice A over 
Choice B? 

It's because we are a red state, after all. 

Because we cannot seem to get past this di- 
chotomy, it is now up to Ihe Democratic party to 
work around this particular scheme, and elect a 
leader who can go past such irile descriptions as 



"red" or "blue" and bring about the kind ol cam- 
paign that the Republicans have been able to 
manage despite having somewhat limited mate- 
rial to market to the American public. 

Bui instead of witnessing a Democratic meta- 
morphosis that could bring about a new era of 
progressive thinking. In Democrats aresiill giv- 
ing in to the now-suppressed anger that has been 
building over the last two elections. 

Ii is more important merely 10 cause trouble, 
as in the hold-up over the confirmation of Con- 
dolcezza Rice, the Secretary of State, than to plan 
ahead to the legislative agenda in the coining 
months and the future situation in the Middle 

As long as President Bush is in the White 
House, it is quite difficult for the Democratic es- 
tablishment to see past last November. 

This apathy within the Democratic party is 
troubling, because iis dissenting voice is needed 

With the Iraqi elections bringing about the 
possibility of getting troops out of Iraq and al- 
lowing the Iraqi public to govern themselves, it 
is important that Hush and his Republican allies 
remember tb.it kill ol the population happens to 
disagree with a great deal of his agenda. 

But there have been no indications that the 
Democrats are willing to rise to this important 
task on any level. And for all of the talk of the 
back-aod-lorth ol the political parties over the 
years, unless the Democrats take action now, a 
status as .i permanent minority becomes a great- 
er possibility. 

The next chairman of the DNC wit! noi only 
of the Democratic party, it will be 



nuulicatorol the Democratic 



However, if the chances of Howard Dean are 
any indication, it appears that the Democrals are 
not yet ready to be done with their temper tan- 
trum yet. and the damage will be for far longer

Ian. 27, 1945. 

Mark this day well in your mind. 

We're all accustomed lo the fact that 
1945 brought about the end of World War 
II. The defeat of Nazi Germany and the 
surrender of the Japanese Empire are both 
events familiar to young and old alike. 
WWII was and still remains a prime exam- 
ple of what happens when naked, wanton 
aggression is coupled with military deter- 
mination, and then mixed with pseudo- 
religious, quasi-scientific overtones. The 
destruction in the Pacific and on the Eu- 
ropean mainland provides us with telling 
reminders of somber battle sites, where af- 
ternoon shadows only hint at the devasta- 
tion wrought decades before.

Haggling in Korea: Prices lost in translation 



Subtitles 

By Ryan Shepard 
www.koreanryan.com 



I had been in Korea for three months 
when I tried to barter with the man at 
Yongsan Electronics Market. I was proud 
of myself, because this time I was plan- 
ning to bargain in Korean: no more of that 
pseudo-English bartering that I did when I 
bought my mp3 player. No. this time 1 was 
prepared. 

I was convinced that I'd get a better 
deal this way; so convinced, in fact, that 
I told the man I was from France when 
he asked. I rifled through my head for a 
more believable nationality, Italian. ..Greek 
maybe, but French was the only semi-be- 
lievable one I knew how to say in Korean. 
French was good enough. He won't try to 
speak English to me now, I thought. 

When I expressed interest in a cam- 
era, the first thing he did was tell me that 
I didn't want that one. "Too old," he said. 

"But it's too expensive," I said. "I don't 
have enough money." Truth be told, I did 
have enough money; it's just that I didn't 



should look at it." 

I managed to navigate through the 
menus with my less-than-perfect French 
(the first time all those French classes paid 
off). It was nice, but still more than I want- 
ed to spend. 

"It's too much," I said. "Give me a 
discount, and I'll buy this one." 

"No," he said. "It's already very cheap. 



I can't give you a discount." 

But when I got up to leave, he sat me 
back down and said he'd go ask his man- 
ager what he could do. At the time, I was 
convinced that he just walked around the 
corner and did nothing. This suspicion 
was confirmed when he gave me his busi- 
ness card at the end of the transaction. He 
was listed as the manager; he didn't have 
to go ask anyone. 

"OK," he said when he came back. 
"I'll give it to you for 420,000 won," a little 
less than 5400. It was a big discount from 
his initial price of 450,000 won, but it was 
still too expensive. I told him so. 

He proceeded to show me the fea- 
tures again. He took a picture of the fan 
behind him and made a big deal about the 
fact that you could see every blade even 
though the fan was spinning fast. Any 
camera can do that if you set it right, I 
thought, big deal. 



"OK," I said and handed him the 
money. I was still 5,000 light, making it a 
round 400,000 won, but I told him it was 
all I had. Really, it was true. I only had 
400,000 on me, but there was a bank ma- 
chine a few feet away, and a quick swipe 
could have gotten me another million. 

I paid and began to leave, but he 
stopped me. "That's the friend price. We're 
friends now. Come back to this shop next 
something,

a understand. He gave me 5,000 



1 walked away with my camera, hap- 
py with the fact that I saved 50,000 won. I 
was doing well for myself. 

When I got home. I wanted to see ex- 
actly how much I had saved, so I got on the 
computer and compared prices online: 
S350 here, $300 there, and finally I found it 
for S270. I had just paid about $370 for it. 
My deal wasn't quite the deal I thought it 
was. I was a little disappointed. 

Then I thought back to the mp3 play- 
er I had bought a month before. I wonder 
how much I got ripped off then, I won- 
dered. That transaction was all in English 
using only a calculator to show prices. 
There were no discounts that time. 

I found it online at a few retailers: 
S160 here, 5175 there. I had paid less than 
5100 for it. I got my deal, just not on the 
item that I thought I'd get it on. 

So much for getting a bargain when 
I tried to speak in Korean— and it took me 
half an hour to figure out how to set my 
camera's menu to English from French.

While Robert DeNiro

Sean Penn's Sam is a loner who 
thinks he has friends, an an-

shaky and handheld through- 
out the film, is representative of 
Bicke's unhinged state of mind. 
It is screaming after him as he 
rushes towards destiny and in 
moments when shots are sta- 
tionary, it is almost visually dis- 
turbing. It is moments of clarity 

If one were to ask Sam 
Bicke if he were disillusioned, 
he would say that he is not, he 
only seeks out the truth in a dis- 



The lump in his throat is 
sizable and the adrenaline and 
fear force him to abandon a 
cool, collected plan. Bicke then 
rushes security guards and fires 
point blank, squeaking, spit- 
ting and screaming through re- 
hearsed lines. 

It is moments like these 
when "Assassination" is fero- 
cious. They cause us to simulta- 
neously recoil and amp up our 
desire to zoom in on the action. 

We observe Bicke's ac- 
tions, his thoughts, his words, 
and they pile up throughout the 
film, leaving us to sift through 
them and wonder how things 
will be played out This is genu- 
ine suspense, even as we are 
vaguely aware of the outcome, 
we wonder in vain what will be- 
come of the sad Sam Bicke since 
we know he won't succeed. 

The camera, so often

between them, but Sam doesn't 
know to accept it. In a tense 
moment she reprimands him, 
commanding him to stay away 
from her. pauses as if out of fear 
or regret, and then says, coldly 
and sadly: "I mean it." 

Bicke's entire agenda is 
quickly formed as he watches, 
as happiness, rights and dignity 
are sacrifed in order for people 

The President is referred to 
as the ultimate salesman, hav- 
ing promised to take America 
out of Vietnam twice, failing to 
do so, and still being re-elected. 
He still made the sale. This in- 
furiates 

Bicke's fiery will 10 be 



with disapproval. His wife and 
brother shun him. his honest 
business proposal Fails, and his 
partnership with the Black Pan- 



thers is rejected. 

What Bicke hopes to ac- 
complish, other than mass 
murder and assassination, is 
fuzzy. Sure, he'll knock off the 
White House, but how will that 
trickle down to the rest of the 
world? 

It will show that the elite 
in control are touchable, but 
whether or not this makes any 
difference is a frustrating ques- 
tion, but like his family, his job 
and aspirations, this method 
will always tall short. 

It seems in films like this, 
which are engaging and inter- 
esting, scary and unnerving, 
the main character can only 
succeed through destruction. 

He must prove that he is 
capable of striking back in a big 
way. Only through fiery means 
can fire be beaten. But we know 
flame only consumes flame, 
and that bright, twisted sparks 
can only get lost in the shadow

concertgoers from attending

This piece was written as the

into the main melodies of the 
piece. Themes from "Eine Kle-

Mozart wrote. This symphony 
is unique, not only because it 
is one of just two symphonies 
Mozart composed in a minor 
key, but also because it is a pre- 
cursor to the musical Romantic 
era. Tchivzhel said this piece is 
a romantic (beginning) to the 
romantic freedom (of) Men- 
delssohn, Lizst, Schubert and 
Beethoven; in essence, there is 
a very definite feeling of indi- 
vidualism in the work.

mass-like passages in the sec-

tured a brisk aura smoothed by 
a French horn duet in the trio, 
while the fourth movement was 
lively, like a desperate chase 
with grumbling lower strings 
and moments of tranquility. 

The last notes brought im- 
mediate applause as Tchivzhel 
took two bows and shook the 
hands of all the principal string 
players.

Upperclassmen 
lead the way 



By Dan Vance 

iplivrninmunitator.org 



When the 2004 baseball sea- 
son began at IPFW, head coach 
Billy Gcrnon had many goals. 
One of those goals was for his 
team to perform on a consistent 

As the 2005 season pre- 
pares to kick off on Feb, 20. it 
is back to basics again for the 
Mastodons. Mostly because the 
ideal consistency that Gernon 
alluded to a year ago has still 
not been maintained. 

Fortunately for Gernon, he 
has an experienced club to guide 
this year. As the season begins. 
18 of the 26 players on the ros- 
ter are upperclassmen. Three 
sophomores and five freshmen 
fill the remaining spots. 

One of the downfalls for the 
team is a slight inexperience in 
pitching. The Mastodons' lop 
three pitchers in ERA {earned 
run average) for 2004 have 
h graduation. 



Bui that is where the inex- 
perience comes to a close in 
most aspects. Last year, offense 
was looked to supplement the 
defense. 

But as some games proved, 
the offense usually led the 



hopes of the squad. Leading 
that offense arc two juniors. 
Ryan Keena and Tyler Fowler, 
who both bad explosive sopho- 
more lampaigns. 

"|Ryan| is a balanced switch 
hitter," noted Gernon. 

Two solid hitting outfield- 
ers and one infielder make up 



Steinbach a 
Fremion were the top two hit- 
ters by hatting average. 

Gernon attests that lead- 
ership on offense to the two's 
experience on die Division I 



"We ; 



■\perieiued 



and we should be a lot r 
competitive," said Gernon. 

Of the three sophomores on 
the team. Max Guyll. is the only 
who played for the Mastodons 
last year, hitting .125 in only 
eight al-bats. 

Another sophomore. Trevor 
Carpenter, is new lo IPFW. 

Meanwhile Adam Gibson. 
the third sophomore, will return 
to the team as a pitcher after 
missing last season. 

Gibson played catcher as a 
freshman in 2003. 



"Wen

High RPI rating 
important for IPFW 



By Nick West 



The Ratings Percentage index (RPI) of the 
IPFW men's basketball team plays a fairly large 
role in the school's potential affiliation with a 
conference. 

IPFW Athletic Director Mark Pope said the 
RPI ranking of a men's basketball program is 
important, but not the sole factor, of what con- 
ferences scour when considering the addition of 
a school. 

"I think it (RPI) is significant for conferences 
that we want to get into, but in a slightly different 
way than I used to," Pope said. 

The NCAA has used the RPI since 1981 to 
supplement the selection of at-large teams and 
the seeding of all teams for the NCAA basketball 
tournament. Because of a television contract 
with CBS in the hundreds of millions of dollars, 
the NCAA tournament held in March is the high- 
est source of monetary revenue for participating 
conferences and its members. 

Each of the 64 teams in the tournament gets 
a chunk of money to bring back to their confer- 
ence. Thirty-four teams earn at-large bids or 
invitations based on many factors RPI being one 
of the most prevalent. The other 30 are teams 
that win their respective conference tourna- 
ments and receive an automatic berth. 

The Horizon I eague and Mid-Continent two 
conferences IPFW has expressed high interest 
in always have one, sometimes two teams repre- 
senting each in the NCAA tournament including 
a conference tournament champion from both.

sum of money that is brought back to the confer-

League, with each getting 1/10 of the revenue, 
including Butler. That leaves an additional 1/10

If the Mastodons are able to raise their RPI 
high enough to bring the enlire conference RPI 
average up, then the Horizon or Mid-Con would 
factor that into consideration for adding the 
school as a member. 

This will increase the chances of the confer- 
ence sending two oi even dine additional teams 
to the NCAA tournament because IPFW's indi- 
vidual RPI and/or overall conference RPI are 
high enough for the NCAA tournament selection 
committee's consideration. 

Easier said than done. 

The RPI is derived of three factors: Division 
I winning percentage, schedule strength and 
opponent's schedule strength. Schedule strength 



is the most important. Different weights are 
given to the location of the game for both the 
winner and loser of the game. Games against 
non-Division I opponents are not used in calcu- 
lating the RPI. 

Though the NCAA does not release an official 
RPI list to the public until the season's end. there 
are many independent outlets that create their 
own RPI rating system that is usually on par 
when the NCAA does release its own. 

Accordingtd RPlratings.com, IPFW's RPI ranks 
306 out of 330 Division I teams. As a conference, 
the Horizon and Mid-Con's RPI averages 19 and 
25 out of 31 Division I conferences. Only three 
of the 18 total teams in the two conferences have 
a lower RPI than IPFWYoungstown State (329, 
Horizon), Savannah State (327, Horizon) and 
Centenary (324, Mid-Con). Seven of them (four 
Mid-Con, three Horizon) rank higher than IPFW 
but no higher than a 237. 

The chances are unlikely that IPFW can help 
raise a conference HP] at this point, but Pope is 
optimistic about the team raising its RPI by this 

"I think a mid-200 number is somelhing 

achievable." Pope said. "It is reachable (by the 
end of the season)." 

Hypothetically, if IPFW earns conference affil- 
iation in the near future, ii would lake a miracle 
for the Mastodons to make the March tourna- 

The only way would be if the Mastodons 
win the conference tournament against more 
established competition or receive one of the 34 
at-large bids. Those at-large bids are based on a 
few dynamics. 

Beside RPI. the NCAA selection committee 
that chooses the 34 at-large teams bases its deci- 
sion on overall regular season and conference 
record, how well the team finished the regular 
season, how many other teams are represent Ing 



At 306 and the harshest part of its schedule 
complete, it will be lough, bui not impossible, 
for IPFW to raise its RPI enough to garner more 
Mid-Con or Horizon League con- 



i their 3-16 

Division I record. However, those conference 
oliicidls may be looking at other ipialittes oi 
IPFW. 

Academic standards, location of the school 
and what else the school can bring to the confer- 
ence play major roles. 

Pope said IPFW's academics are very strong 
and up to par with Mid-Con and Horizon League 
schools. He added the school's geography isrighl 
in place with die two conferences, too. Many 
of the schools in the conferences are located in 
the Midwest. Through all of this, though, Pope 
admits that men's basketball and its RPI has a 
larger impact on conference affiliation than any 
other single sport in IPFW's current situation. 

"Because of the (NCAA tournament)," Pope 
said. "It has a bigger influence than others 
(sports), but it's purely because of the dollars. It's 
all dollar-driven."

other Mastodon to reach double-digit 
figures against the Flyers. 

IPFW will not have to face Lewis 
again until April 13 on the road at 7 
p.m. They will be looking to defeat the 
Flyers in the rematch to improve their 
conference standing for the season. 

Also, the Mastodons will be trav-

It will be another opportunity for 
IPFW to pick up a win against another

The next few weeks will be crucial 
for the Mastodons, who face two more
