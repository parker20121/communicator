Pitch collections 

by Lynn Bobay 

For the third con- 
secutive year Circle K 
will take j'art in the 
WOWC lenny Fitch is to 
assist a needy family 
in the Fort Wayne area. 
Last year's contributions 
through Circle K amount- 
ed to'over 1^700. This 
year the organization 
hopes for even better 
results. 

This year the club 
is a^ain usinp the 
bathtub to collect the 
money in. However, 
there may be one change: 
there may be two bath- 
tubs this year instead 
of the traditional one 
which has been used the 
past two years. 

Members of Circle K 
will be pushing the 
bathtubs through shop- 
ping centers Dec. 19* 
Dec. 21- the coeds will 
push the tubs from the 
I-FU campus to down- 
town Fort Wayne. 

The Circle K bath- 
tub is currently in 
front of the Circle K 
coatrooffi to collect 
money from I-IU stu- 
dents for the Penny 
Pitch.

-To the editors- 



'Silent majorily' speaks 

In your poper of Novornbei 19 Mark 
Soudcr bicively wrote o column titled 
"Joff Gibson's ancestors." I 
tboughl "How wonderful! Wo of tbc 
silent mojorlly linolly bave a spokes- 
mon." Then in your paper of Decem- 
ber 3,3ouder's ancestry was discus- 
sedin o letter to ihe editor. 



I feel obligoled to c 



defeni 



o Mark's 



the silent majority. 

We, too, love peace and hole war. 
We have especially come Id dislike 
the war in Vietnam. We, too, find 
il senseless and destructive. How- 
ever, we think It would bo even more 

our eounlry be led inio anarchy which 
is what we would hove if all of us 
put our individual freedoms obove 
those of Ihe community, 

The question is, "Do we love 

member of sociely?" If we lookot 
Ihe problem of Vietnam in a larger 
than individual perspective we see 
that for us Vietnam is o unique 
historical experience for which we 
as country were unprepared. 

Remember? Wc entered Vietnam 
just otter saving the world from Ihe 
machinotionsol Hitler. Once out 
country hod played the role of savior 
il was diificull to discoid this role 
to become o mere spectator. 

Just OS on individual can seldom 
change his personality overnight, 
neither con o country. In both coses, 
if one is to avoid disintegralion, il 
must be on orderly process; o time 

As I see it, both JefF Gibson and 
Mark Souder ore ottempting to im- 
prove our society. One practices a 
spectacular, disintegrative method 
while the other seems to prefer on 
orderly, dovelopmentol process. As 
for me, I still hove faith in the tri- 
umph of the ballot!

From Souder to Culver 

Dear Joe Culver, 

Thorik* for your suggestion ihol I 
join the army and be somebody. I'd 
volunteer except 1 faint at the sight 
of blood.

'Celebration'' diBCUBsed 

Dear Editors; 

After viewing "Celebrotion" Sat- 
urday evening I became aware of the 
inability of the PIT to distinguish 
between what is moral and what is 
"mmorol. Upon claiming to present 

continually ossuolted with lines 
that insult ond blaspheme God, and 
lewd scenes which portray only the 
lowest of humon existence. 

A ploy which professes to be moral 

ol. The actions of Mr. Rich and com' 
pony con not by ony stretch of the 
imoginotion be considered moral. 
PIT obviously staged the ploy 
well, adopting techniques from the 
Polish "Lovatory"Theotre to suit 
its own needs. The acting wos good, 
noting however, the childish monner 
in the use of flesh. Scenery ond 
I ighling were occeptoble, bu t al I in 
all PIT hos sunk to new depths in 



by Mark Souder 

Sooner or later it 
seems tbat people would 
tire of the constant 
sex and love displayed 
by the theatre. But 
man's evil nature doesn't 
become bored with the 
lewdity of the stage. 
The pleasures of the eye^ 
the dance hall stripper 
"who consistently bless- 
es our eyes with visual 
splendor, " are irresit- 
able to sinful man. 

PIT has been one of 
the leading catalysts 
of this diegusting trend. 
Take "You're a Good Man 
Charlie Brown" for ex- 
ample. While it prob- 
ably wasn't as bad as 
some, it didn't take a 
mad Puritan to spot the 

I evil eye Dale Mcintosh 
gave his youthful play- 
mates, particularly the 
one dog. The directors 
were at least decent 
enough to have the coy- 
otes done off-stage, but 
it was nonetheless an 
adult comedy. 

How the Convocations 
committee, heavily infil- 
trated with PIT people, 
has joined the "sex and 
love" bandwagon by 



its selection of 
lion" isdefinit. 
better ploys, 
--Ston Jones 



ripts 



"Celebro 



SEE IT- 



bringing "Twelfth Wight. 
The title of this blub- 
bering romance itself 
has illicit connotations 
(everybody knows what 
happens at night). But 
Shal:espeare one-ups PIT, 
at least on stage. He 
has persons of the same 
sex falling in love, 
Shakespeare himself had 
reputed tendencies; but 
he never taught dancing. 

The love story was 
not without humor. The 
Mark Franke of "Twelfth 
Night," Sir Toby Belch, 
and his Lambda buddies 
provided many laughs. 
Some of the humor was 
at the expense of the 
"mad" Puritan, Malvolio, 
This was particularly 
offensive to me. They 
even mocked Mr, America 
John Wayne. 

Actually, in spite of 
its indecencies, "Twelfth 
Night" was funny. It was 
probably just a product 
of Will's desire to be 
somebody. But only a 
small percentage of the 
students attended. Of 
course, after Celebra- 
tion, what is there 
left to see?

Ils chief attraction, howevei 
that it contains a short deserii 
of each section written by the

useful information as lexlboohs to 
be used, tests and papers to be as-

tor will take. 

The English Deportment Publica- 
tions Committee feels that the book- 
let will be especially useful to Uni- 
versity Division students plonning 
their spring progroms in the weeks 
ahead, but other students interested 
in introductory literature courses 
may have copies also.

I-PU Tuskers squeeze by George Williams Friday 



by Fhil Hartman 

After absorbing a 
105-61 thrashing from 
franklin on Nov, 30, 
the l-ru Tuskers re- 
:)ounded with a hard- 
fought 102-100 victory 
jver George Williams 
Last Friday at the Cen- 
bral High Gym. 

Franklin pulled away 
from the regional ca- 
;ers early in their 
jontest and, after am- 
issing a 51 point lead 
it halftime were never 
threatened. The Tuskers, 
without the services 
)f top scorer Kip Bailey, 
*ere led by Gary Trump, 
Sugene Devbrow, and Fhil 
jDve, who respectively 
sallied 1^, 12, and 11 
joints. 

The highlight in the 
:attle with George 
/illiams was the return 
jf Kip Bailey. Bailey 
jet a new school record 
ly tallying 44 points 
In leadir.g the Tuskers 
;o their second win of 
;he young season. He 
low has the highest 
jeering average in the 
lity college race (28.5 
joints per game). His 
learest competitor is 
iveraging ^ust over 20 



per outing. 

The Tuskers trailed 
most of the game and 
were down by three at 
halftime 55-50. But the 
full court press of the 
taller George Williams 
squad was not quite as 
effective in the second 
half, and the Tuskers 
were able to eek out a 
two-point win. 

Backing up Bailey's 
performance were- Dev- 
brow CI6), John Powell 
(I'l), and Tyrone Bish- 
op (15). Bishop also 
turned in a good de- 
fensive performance. 

The cagers trav- 
elled to Kokoino Wednes- 
day to play lU regional 
squad there. Tonight 
the Tuskers take on 
Ohio State Lima Region- 
al at the Central High 
Gym. lU Southeast is 
here tomorrow after- 
noon. 

Opening tip-off to- 
night will be at 8 p.m. 
and tomorrow after- 
noon's f^ame will begin 
at 2 p.m. There's 
plenty of parking at 
Central and there is 
no admission, ^jO get 
it together and support 
the Tuskers! 



Celebration - 'an experience^ 



by Scott Gillie 

Celebration is an 
jxperience. Acting, 
singing, dancing, mu- 
I3ic , make-up , costumes , 
laet, and technical 
jffects combine to in- 
rolve the audience be- 
yond objectivity. 

Just as the si- 
lences between words 
)ften communicate 
aore than the words 
themselves, the tran- 
sitions in a play re- 
real much of the es- 
sence of the produc- 
:ion. The cast and 
!rew were truly im- 
jressive in present- 
ing a collage of act- 
ivity before the aud- 
ience. The opening 
light audience wit- 
lessed a well-timed, 
fell-executed pro- 
Luc t ion. 

The importance of 
;he sharpness of the 
sast and crew cannot 
le over emphasized, 
?he production traces 
:he essence of theatre, 
:he very essence of 
;he human condition 
;o its tribal, ritu- 
J-istic roots. For 
his to work, the 
udience must be in- 
olved throughout, 
. proscenium cannot 



separate the players 
from the audience. 
The opening night 
audience was drawn 
along effectively. 
When the final nxunber 
finished, there was 
a feeling among the 
members of the audience 
that it was not yet 
time to leave. 

David Thompson's 
performance deserves 
first mention. He 
sunnounts the age ob- 
stacle through a fine 
performance. As the 
nasty, embittered tlr. 
Rich, there was no 
question that when 
Mr. Rich said he was 
bored, he was bored. 
Bored. 

The sensitive 
voices of Dale Kcln- 
tosh and Tlarty Tiemey 
added to the quality 
of the production, 

Sharon Gabet handled 
a difficult role nice- 
ly. Her portrayal of 
Blanche-like tough- 
ness with a touch of 
naivete worked well. 

The principles, 
aided by the enthu- 
siastic ensemble, 
successfully presented 
on Doug LeBrecht's 
ghoulish set a ritual 
experience. 




I,,.^TCuLi; mCTIUI - Indiana-iurdue's forward ^.a^k 
lutt aims for two points in o recent game whilf- 
hastodon f.ip Bailey, number ^2, looks on.
