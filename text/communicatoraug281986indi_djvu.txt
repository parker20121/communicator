Budget set for 1986-87 

IPFW operating 



with $29,25 million 




By RALPH HAINES 
Staff Writer 

It will lake $29.25 million dollars just lo keep IPFW in operation for the next 
year, according to John R. Carnaghi, vice chancellor for financial affairs. That 
amount, approved by the Boards of Trustees of both Indiana University and 
Purdue University as the general budget for IPFW for 1986-1987, is 27 percent 
greater than the IPFW general budget for 1984-1985. Carnaghi points out that the 
budget is over 70 percenlforpeopleand the increasenow is due, to some degree, to 
an attempt to make up for the large losses in comparative salaries sustained 
during Ihehigh inflation period of the lff70s. 

IPFW. as a state supported university, will get nearly $18, 5 million from the 
state of Indiana, Appropriations by the state legislature are made over two years 
in advance. For instance, planning must start this coming March for the monies lo 
be requested tor 1988 and 1989. 

Student fees will account for just under S9 million, with the remainder coming 
from such sources as Follet's bookstore. Canteen Corporation, other leases. 
federal research granl overhead, etc 

ITie determination of how the budget will be spent is a lengthy process and 
begins when the chancellor instructs the vice chancellor, by letter, lo identify what 
Carnaghi calls "high and low priorities." For next year's budget planning this will 
likely start this November Each department and operation will be expected to 
review the previous budget and answer two questions: 1) Whatwoutdyoudoif you 
had 10 percent more to spend? and2&gt; What would you do if you had 10 percent less 
to spend? Each department is given an opportunity to order its priorities and 
justify its needs. These priorities are reviewed by the dean and sent on lo the 
chancellor, who is asked to submit, by late February or early March, priorities for 
all IPFW based on the legislative appropriation previously made. 

Some funding is predetermined and cannot easily be changed. Eieclricity, for 
example, is budgeted for over SI. 2 million this year. While conservation may be 
able to reducethisamount to some extent, such programs! e.g., turning off every 
second light on the parking lots 1 often take a toll in other areas, such as safely. 

Auxiliary enterprises, which furnish services for the departments without going 
outside IPFW, are essentially self-supporting in Ihal each department pays the 
auxiliary unit for services out of the departmental budget. Student aid, which is 
budgeted at just over $1,2 million this year, receives most of its money from 
federal and slate sources such as the various student loan programs and some of 
the grant and scholarship programs. The total figure for aid, which benefits 60 
percent of the lull-time sludents and about 30 percent of the total enrolled, is much 
higherlhan that figure. - -_--._ 

While each department and operation is expected to remain pretty much within 
Ihe prepared budget, there are always changes and unforeseen circumstances 
which may increase or decrease a deparimenfs (or operation's) needs for the 
year. Adjustments can be made as they become necessary, at the discretion of the 
chancellor, except for major expenditures. 



Wallace announces year's goals 




Wallace 



By MICHEI.E R. SHAFFER 
Editor-in-Chief 

A total academic reorganization of 
tPFW is in order for this fall, Thomas 
P Wallace announced Monday at a 



faculty and staff convocation. 

Wallace, who joined IPFW as 
chancellor July 1 , told a crowd of about 
400 faculty and staff members Monday 
that he would like a recommendation 
on Ihe appropriate reorganization for 
IPFW presented lo him by Nov. 1. He 
will then make a final proposal to 
Purdue President Steven Beering by 
Dee. I. 

Presently IPFW is divided into 
departments, according to school 
affiliation. There are three units, Arts 
and Letters, Community Outreach and 
Professional Studies, that have I.U. 
programs. Two additional units, the 
School of Engineering, Technology and 
Nursing and the School of Science and 
Humanities that have Purdue 
University programs. 

Al Beering's request, a faculty 
committee will reorganize Ihese units 
and their departments into schools, for 



example a school of Hne arts could be 
formed, said Wallace. 

Professors leaching Purdue 
programs will continue to be paid by 
Purdue and professors teaching in any 
I.U . programs will be paid by I.U.. said 
Wallace Monday. 

Wallace said he also plans to enforce 
a university Task Force on the Nature 
and Quality of the Undergraduate 
Experience at IPFW which will 
examine such issues as class size, 
curriculum. internships, and 
academic and career counseling. 

We want to "embrace education as a 
preparation for a lifetime," said 
Wallace Monday, Wallace said he 
wants IPFW lo attract students who 
would otherwise turn to private 
universities lo satisfy their 
educational needs, for example the 
attention a student receives in a 
smaller class. 



A third major project Wallace 
mentioned Monday is an enrollment 
management program. This study will 
look at what IPFW students' needs are 
and find a way lo communicate what 
IPFW has to offer these students. 

"This plan of work I have outlined 
today." said Wallace in closing, "will 
require much of our time and 
dedication. 

"My hope is that you will join me in 
this effort to outline IPFW's academic 
priorities and growth inlo the I990's." 

Wallace said Monday that he plans 
to have a similar convocation to the 
one held Monday each fall to discuss 
the work to be done for the year. 
Following in the spring, he will meet 
with the faculty to re^ew and assess 
the accomplishments of the goals 
layedout inthefall. 



Opening ceremony 
planned for animal 
care facility 



By JOHN McGAULEY 
Staff Writer 

Work is nearly complete on a new 
million dollar animal care facility on 
the IPFW campus. Located just off 
West Campus Drive, north of Kettler 
Hall, the 9,000 square fool building will 
be used primarily to support 
psychological and biological sciences, 
medical education, and preventllive 
dentistry research programs. 

According lo Don Katter, a 
spokesman for the physical plant, the 
new facility will provide student and 
faculty researchers with 13 individual 
working rooms, cage washing, 
restroom and dressing facilities, and 
five independent laboratories. Also, 
areas for the storage and preparation 
of animal feeds are available. 

Prior lo now. research involving 
animals had been held in a temporary 
facility on campus which, according to 
Katter, "doesn't ev£n come close" to 
meeting state and federal guidelines 
governing such aclivily. This, as well 
as the desire lo create a more cen- 



tralized reseipch environment for the 
major disciplines needing such a 
capability, led to the facility's con- 
struction. 

Current plans call for the facility to 
handle only relatively small animals, 
such as rodents, on a regular basis. 
while the capability lo handledogs and 
cats does exist- One room in the 
building is being outfitted to handle 
monkeys. 

No regular classes or programs are 
slated to be held In the new facility, 
however, occasional lab sessions arc 
likely to be held there. One reason for 
this is Ihc restricted size of the in- 
dividual rooms, which isonly about 150 
square feel . 

Katter said access lo the building 
will be fairly restricted, with only 
those directly involved in research 
programs being allowed Inside on a 
regular basis. Physical plant em- 
ployees have been provided access to 
the mechanical systems in the facility 
which will not require them lo enter 
the research areas of the building.

These restrictions are designed mainly 
to protect the animals boused in the 
building, which are normally highly 
susceptible lo germs carried by 
humans. 

Douglas Wartzok, chairman of the 
biological sciences department at 
IPFW. feels the animal care facility 
will prove to be an "attractive 
resource" in attracting new faculty 
and students lo the school. Wartzok 



facility being 



also said he is looking forward to 
utilizing the facility because of the 
capability for researchers to conduct 
safesurgery on specimens in a campus 
facility which meets standards set tor 
such activity. 

While construction on the facility has 
lagged tjchind approximately three 
weeks, it is now planned for com- 
pletion in early September, with 
dedication ceremonies slated for Sept,

In the relatively short span of two 
months, Thomas Wallace has managed 
to gently change the direction and 
altitude of IPFW. That's quite a feat for 
a newcomer to lake on at a regional 
campus fraught with disputes over who 
is better — Indiana or Purdue. 

Since joining IPFW as chancellor July 
1, Wallace has l&gt;egun an ambitious 
pursuit of excellence here, Already 
Wallace has initiated what he calls a 
Task Force on the Nature and Quality of 
the Undergraduate Experience at 
IPFW The task force will reportedly 
investigate what elements constitute a 
high quality undergraduate experience. 

As a result of that task force. Wallace 
hopes that IPFW will have many of the 
facets that a private school might offer a 
student : small class size, good academic 
and career counseling, quality honors 
programs and more exposure of all 
students to the liberal arts. Wallace also 
plans to kick off a major fundraiser next 
fall and expects to see a fine arts 
building occupied on campus by 1990, If 
Wallace follows through with his plans 
as well as he is making them, IPFW will 
be rid of those dilapidated buildings on 
W. Berry St. within a few years. 

Yet another ambitious, if not 
courageous, task which Wallace plans to 
accomplish is to have an annual 
convocation with faculty to discuss the 
upcoming year's goals. Then in the 
spring he and the faculty will meet again 
to review progress on those goals. 

Such willingness to communicate 
shows Wallace is sincere about bettering 
IPFW He has emphasized his eagerness 
about the years ahead and has 



repeatedly encouraged us all to work 
together on these goals. 

It is our hope that Wallace will 
continue to nurture the relationship 
budding between him and the IPFW 

However, Chancellor Wallace, please 
don't overlook what some people in the 
past have apparently not considered 
important. Attend the faculty senate 
meeting; make yourself visible to the 
students. Be accessible to their 
questions. IPFW has suffered too much 
in the past from chancellors who neither 
listen nor communicate with faculty, 
staff and students. 

Secondly, listen. Digest the students' 
comments and see if they are valid or 
not. Find out if a problem is present 
where one is said to exist. Don't brush off 
what is said simply because we are 
students or just a staff member. 

Finally, and most importantly, 
continuetorequestthesupport of each of 
us to build IPFW into what you call a 
"quality urban institution." Encourage 
and remind the faculty to work together 
as a team. IPFW can only improve with 
unity. 

IPFW does not stand for the 
overshadowing of one major university 
by another. It stands for two 
internationally recognized universities 
— Purdue and Indiana — working 
together to prepare today's students — 
to give them that education that WILL 
last a lifetime. 

And lest we forget, say goodbye to the 
"revolving door chancellors" of past 
years. 

Welcome Chancellor Wallace.

Another school year has begun and 
already ill winds have started to blow 
across campus in the form of another — 
yes, another — controversy. 

Is it political unrest? Uncertainty 
about the future of South Africa and 
apartheid? Hunger in America? 
Disarmament? 




No, the controversy on campus is 
much more important to the fate of the 
world. Haven't you heard? The "P" in 
the new IPFW logo is larger than the 
"I," 

Many people feel this is just one more 
step in Purdue University's bid to 
conquer Indiana University using our 
major metropolitan area campus as an 
instrument. 

We at The Communicator have inside 



information from an expert source that 
their next move will be bringing in a 
battalion of contras from South America 
to take over regional campuses in 
Indianapolis and Columbus. 

The new logo, of course, falls on the 
heels of the "Purdue takeover." No. this 
doesn't mean that Indiana University is 
now a nonentity in Fort Wayne. lU is 
alive and well. But the takeover, we 
remind you, was a decision of both 
university boards of trustees, giving 
Purdue President Stephen Beering the 
edge on IPFW matters. The deal was not 
made under duress. 

The unrest caused by the new logo ' 
bearing the "bigger P" centers around 
Beering's predominant control of IPFW. 
The pro-Indiana people feel this is just 
another Purdue powerplay contrived to 
put the Bloomington team another point 
behind West Lafayette. 

So is the score 2-0 for Purdue? One 

point for the takeover and one for the 
bigger P? Maybe we need to get an 
unbiased third party to referee and keep 
score. Someone like Howard Cossell 
who's got a lot of free time on his hands 
right now. After all, it is just two rival 
teams meeting on the field of honor — 
which in this case is IPFW. 



'Where have 
teachers gone?" 

That's the most i 
reaction from returning 
communications majors. 

L^st year, Rob Adams, 
Jan Roneelli, Ed Griffith and 
Tony Ferri's offices were 
vacant cubicles when some 
of their former students 
went to greet them at the 
beginnii^ of the semester. 

Two new instructors, Vicki 
Karns and Sandy 

Manheimer, were liired, but 
the additions were soon 



jgated with the departure 
Kams and Michael 
Bishow this semester. 

Even those possessing the 
most rudimentary of math 
skills can calculate that 
there are now six, count 'em 
six, vacancies in the com- 
munications department. 

Students brave enough to 
return in hopes of com- 
pleting their degree are left 
to fight and claw (or the 
attentions of Dave Switzer, 
Sandy Manheimer, Dick 
Hess and the chairman of the 



David 
McCants. 

Many students are con- 
cerned about the stress 
placed on the already 
skelrton crew. Will the 
courses Ijecome only a 
cursory and superficial 
overview of the material to 
he covered tjecause the 
instructors simply do not 
have time to adequately 
prepare for their overloaded 
schedules? Are enough

order for the requirements

graduation 
fulfilled? Will courses be 
offered in such an order that 
students will be able to take 
classes in the most logical 
progression? 

What's a student to do? 
Complain? It hasn't done 
any good so far. Demand to 
know what the problem is? 
Nobody's talking — at least 
nobody in the department. 

Plenty of students are 
talking — and what they're 
saying is not flattering to the 
department. Horror stones 
abound. Some i

Big Brothers/Big Sisters needs your help 



By M.KATHLEEN 

GREVEN 

Fealures Editor 

Does this picture remind 
you of sunny Saturday al- 
temoons you spent with your 
dad when you were lo? 

The idea behind Big 
Brothers-Big Sisters is to 
give kids without that adult 
influence and intimacy a 
chance al looking back at 
those happy days — just like 
you are now. 

Before the tall semester 
slips away and you've spent 



every Saturday afternoon on 
Ihe couch in your sweats 
watching ancient cowboy 
movie reruns, why not lake 
your lillle brother or sister 
out to rake leaves together 
and jump into the piles Then 
sjl under a nearby tree and 
sip apple cider? Sounds 
hokey to you? Then you'd be 
amazed at how easily en- 
tertained most kids are. 

These kids are more in- 
terested in your company 
than they are spending all ot 
your money, so don't worry 



that this is an expensiv 

proposition! 

Volunteers come from all 
stations in life. Many are 
college students — jusi like 
you. Some are grandparents, 
others are married couples. 
There are special matches 
made for the amount of time 
you have available and your 
interests. 

Now that you know who 
the Big Brothers and Big 
Sisters are, let's take a look 
at Ihe kind oi child you'll 



have for a Little Brother or only one parent. 

Sjster They are in need of 

„ r ^ - friendship, affection and 

They range in age from 7 ^^^-^^ ^^^ guidance from a 



to 17. They're kids from all 
ethnic, racial and economic 
backgrounds. Most live with 



mature adult. 
Statistics have shown i 



improvement in scholastic 
performance as well as ; 
positive change in behavio 
and altitudes after in 
volvement with a Bi. 
Brother or a Big Sister - 
someone just like you.
