Organizations form on campus 



Republicans 



Bv SCOTT L.NEUMAN 
Staff Writer 

The IPFW College Republicans held 
their first meeting last Wednesday to 
discuss ambitions and future plans for 
the orgamzation and start work on a 
membership drive. 

Tom Harris, the group's organizer, 
IS also a member of the Fort Wayne 
Young Republicans; both groups are 
national organizations. The difference 
between the two groups, according lo 
Harris, is the individual units of the 
College Republicans are more in- 
tegrated between campuses. 

The Young Republicans, however, 
are community-based organizations, 
taking on responsibilities within their 
respective districts, and generally 
remaining autonomous from charters 
in other parts of the country Hams 
hopes the two organizations can work 
together in this area to further their 
mutual political aims. 
Harris t)elieves the time is ripe for 



organizing a major conservative group 
on campus, because "Students on 
college campmes have traditionally 
been very liberal, but there is a 
genuine movement in a conservative 
direction." He feels the IPFW College 
Republicans can be a success by 
taping into these new conservative 
resources in higher education. 

At the meeting, goals were set for 
theorganization. Those present agreed 
the -primary purpose should be to 
educate the student constituency on 
those political issues which concern 
them as voters. Secondary goals in- 
clude more characteristically political 
activities, such as conducting fund- 
raisers for local Republican can- 
Harris would like to see an eventual 
membership of some 200 students on 
campus, with at least 25-50 actively 
involved. Jeff Miller, acting public 
relations director for the group, has 
been placed in charge of a mem- 
bership drive which will be carried out 
in the basement of Kettler Hall during 
the week of Feb 10. Following the 
drive, a meeting is set for Feb, 19 al 9 
p.m. in room IIG of the Walb Memorial 



Union, Harris invites anyone in- 
terested to come lo the meeting, 
staling. "We'd like to hear from all 
Republicans on campus," 



UNICEF 



Bv SCOTT L.NEUMAN 
Staff Writer 

UNICEF is the United NaUons 
emergency relief organization for 
children formed in 194G, With the 
current famine situation in many parts 
of the world, especially Africa. 
UNICEF has rarely been more 
challenged in its efforts lo "save the 
children." 

In 1981. UNICEF decided there was 
a need to educate students in U.S. 
colleges about the hunger problems 
facing various nations In 1984, it 
appointed one "ambassador" from 
each major university to head up an 
effort lo create "Youth for UNICEF" 
organizations on college campuses 
throughout the United Stales. Tom 
Harris was appointed ambassador 
from IPFW, 

Although UNICEF often carries with 



it the stigma of Ihe long and tedious 
television campaigns for money, 
which are the hallmark of its fund- 
raising efforts, education is its major 
goal in creating Youth for UNICEF, In 
addition. Youth for UNICEF may 
eventually take part in orchestrating 
relief efforts from a logislical, rather 
than financial aspect. Harris suggests 
on tills point that students might, for 
example, sludy an area of Africa 
which has problems obtaining safe 
drinking water and attempt to find 
ways to provide il But Harris em- 
phasises that the primary concern of 
UNICEF through its Youth for 
UNICEF program is simply to educate 
the college population. Harris says 
"I'm concerned that there has been a 
drop in interest in world hunger 
problems in the last tew months 
(following USA for Africa. Live Aid, 
etc. I" 

IPFW Youth for UNICEF will be 
holding an organizaliona! meeting on 
February 19th at 7:30 p,m, in room 116 
of the Walb Memorial Union. Harris 
strongly urges anyone interested to 
come to the meeting. 



Group aids alcoholics 



By MICHELE SHAFFER 
Managing Editor 

■■lamwhatllhink." 

Such positive thinking can change a 
woman's life, say Women for Sobriety 
moderators Julie Filipiak and Kathy 
Yarman. 

Bolh are involved In Women For 
Sobriety, a self-help group for women 
alcoholics, formed at IPFW last May, 
The two, along with the help of John 
Ulmer, dean of Student Services, 
organized the local chapter. The 
organization, which meets Tuesday 
nights at 7:30 p.m. in Walb Memorial 
Union, Suite 125, is part of a national 
group formed by Dr. Jean Kirkpatrick 
in Quakerslown, Pennsylvania . 

Like Kirkpatrick, Filipiak and 
Yarman fee! Ihat women alcoholics 
need some additional support 
Alcoholics Anonymous iAA) doesn't 
offer. Yarman. who was formerly very 
actively involved m AA, said she felt 
there had to be more for women. "I felt 
like 1 just needed an additional 
program that would address my 
special needs as a woman. " 

Women for Sobriety addresses the 
special needs of an alcoholic woman 
who does have totally different needs 
than her male counterpart, according 
to twth women. 

Centered around the statement "I 
am what I think," Women For Sobriety 
( WFS ) helps women realize only 
through positive thinking can Ihey 
improve their self-concept, "A lot of 



times, just (byi thinking your day is 
good, it will be good," offered Filipiak. 
The program takes a metaphysical 
outlook, she continued. "It's taking 
negative and turning It into positive." 

in the WrS program, each woman is 
encouraged to awake atiout 15 minutes 
earlier than usual. She should then use 
that time to reflect on the whole 
purpose of the program, and to con- 
centrate on one statement she will use 
that day. During this time each woman 
should also affirm lo herself, "I am a 
capable, competent, caring and 
compassionate woman and have much 
lo give to others." 

At the close of each WFS meeting, 
Uie women — with joined hands — 
make that same affirmation again, to 
each other 

Although the meetings themselves 
arc very unstructured, Filipiak and 
Yarman both head the discussion each 
week "Welrytobothbetherebecause 
it IS so new." saidYarman. 

The topics for discussion are 
provided by a monthly newsletter, 
"Sobering Thoughts." tor which Kirk- 
patrick is responsible. One of the four 
discussion topics each month is always 
one of the 13 statements of acceptance 
by which WFS participants try lo live, 
said Kirkpatrick. An example of these 
stalemenls is: "Happiness is a habit I 
will develop." 

Like Kirkpatrick, who herself was 
an alcoholic for 28 years, Filipiak and 
Yarman are living proof that WFS can

the various aspects of the organisation and the problems of alcoholism for 

women. IPhotoby MarkNew). 



be successful. Filipiak, who Is a 
recovered drug addict and who has 
been sober for two years, is a senior al 
IPFW majoring in sociology. She will 
graduate in June, and hopes lo attend 
graduate school in California, 
"Eventually." said Filipiak. "I want to 
work in women treatment centers." 

Yarman, who in addition lo being 
Filipiak's partner Is also her sister, 
received her associate's degree in 
Mental Health Technology from IPFW 
in June, 1984, and is now working on 
her bachelors degree in social work al 
St, Francis College, Both women are 



certified moderators for WFS by Ihe 
group in Quakerstown, Pennsylvania. 
coordinated by Kirkpatrick. 



They both expressed a concern for 
child care for the women in their 
group, who range in age from IG lo 43. 
One of their goals Is to obtain child 
care at the meetings, thereby serving 
just another of the special needs of 
women alcoholics: child care and 
supervision They hope lo do this so 
more women will be able lo allend the 
meetings. 



Women face problems, form IPFW group 



By MICHELE SHAFFER 
Managing Editor 
Juhe Filipiak is jusl an ordinary 
citizen. 

She was raised in Fori Wayne and 
attended local Catholic grade schools 
and high schools 

But Julie discovered life was not the 
"happy family portrait" she thought it 
would be. Her dreams were shattered 
by divorce— something she was raised 
lo believe was horrible. So Julie, who 
made her own wine every year and 
kepi a plentiful supply on hand in her 
basement, said she turned to the 
bottles of wine to help her cope with 
just a normal day. "I needed a bottle of 
wine to help me get through the 
housework." Julie said. 

Her sister Kathy experienced the 
same trauma of drugs and alcohol 
addiction, "The ideal family didn't 
happen." said Kathy. The mid 60s and 
early '70s came along and with those 
years came the women's revolution, 
and everything was "peace. love and 
drugs. "saidKathy. 

Fortunately, both women faced their 
problems. They got involved in Women 
for Sobriety (WFS). a self-help group 
for women with problems with alcohol 
and dr\ig addiction. 

Julie Filipiak, one of the certified 
moderators of the program at IPFW, 
said society needs lo be shown that 
women alcohoUcs are not the same as 
men alcoholics. Hence, the advent of 
Women for Sobriety. 

"There is a difference between 
drunk men and drunk women. Good 
women don't get drunk," said Filipiak 
in a sarcastic tone, "If they do, they 
are looked on as a lush," she con- 



tinued. In society, it is more ac- 
ceptable for the male to gel drunk, she 
said. While writing a paper on sexism 
in treatment of alcoholism, for a class 
she took at IPFW. Filipiak realized 
women's need ought to be brought out 
in the open. She and her sister Kathy 
are doing this through a local chapter 
of WF^ at IPFW. 

Both women Identified several key 
areas thai are markedly different in 
alcoholic men and women. 

"Women drink tor differenl reasons 
than men." said Julie. Women drink 
out of loneliness, depression, or as a 
result of some recent, shocking life 
event. The women's movement has 
helped to further WFS. said Kathy, 
but il has also created more problems 
Born of the women's movement is a 
new fear of failure — of failing lo be a 
superwoman. In addilion, the 
American society has a mold of the 
"perfect" woman. If a woman doesn't 
fit Ihis pre-cast role, she could ex- 
perience tremendous guilt, said Julie, 
Generally, women alcoholics have 
very low self-esteems, 

"It's real important lo realize the 
potential alcoholic Is there," said 
Kathy. Even in a "good family— thai 
stability there— something happens to 
trigger it (alcoholism, )" 

Kathy also noted a very high risk 
group of women— those most likely to 
develop alcoholism— are recent 
college drop-outs between the ages of 
20 and 25 For these women, noted 
Julie, "it's very difficult lo go out and 
get a job," they have virtually not 
skills and low self-esteems, 

Julie explained the following could 
be signs of alcoholism : 



—drinking to cope or escape; 

—blackouts; 

—inability to control drinking; and. 

—drinking while alone. 

Women for Sobriety offers the 
following five questions to women who 
think they mi^l have a problem with 
drinking: 

1, Do you drink before going to a 
party? 

2, Do you drink to get through the 
day? 

3, Do you always drink lo 
drunkenness? 



1, Do you have trouble remembering 

all of what happened the night before? 

5 Do you ever drink in the morning 

to recover? 

An affirmative answer to any of 
these questions indicates a potential 
problem, according lo WFS standards, 

Julie and Kathy are living proof that 
such problems can be overcome. They 
are what they think they are, and ihey 
lived lo show us that Ihey are com- 
petent, caring women who have a lol lo 
offer to the world. 



Senate urges funding 

By EARL SMITH 
Chief Reporter 

The Student Senate Fine Arts Committee hopes to have Senate Bill 228 amended 
lo include the balance of funding for the fine arts building. Senator Polly Dean said 
last week, 

"I have written a letter to Patrick Kiely (chairman of the House Ways and 
Means Committee) urging him lo find all the added appropriation due to the 
condition of the building, " Dean said. 

On Monday, the bill had not been scheduled for a hearing but Dean expected it to 
be passed this week. 

Student Senate approved the petition of Jeff Doner lo fill a seat. Doner is an 
Indiana University student majoring in finance. He was assigned lo the Internal 
Affairs Commitlee, 



Tours will be scheduled by Student Services on Mondays at 2 p.m. and 3 p,n 
well as Tuesdays and Thursdays at 10 a.m, and U a m. Non-senators are en- 
couraged to assist with this program and may contact Student Services in Walb for 
more information. 

Jack Overmeyers petiUon for board membership was approved leaving only 
four vacancies. Sewell said. 

Rock World videos are again being played in the wcsl alcove of Walb, Melanie 
Lane is inchargeof this projecl, said Sewell. 

Student Senate meets every Wednesday at 9: 15 p,m. in Walb.

Specific reasons only: 
Where is the other half? 



What does it Lake to get a fine arts 
building on this campus? An obscure 
incantation'' A secret combination? A 
guaranteed parking place? 

ff anyone knows why (specific 
reasons only, pleasei, the proposed 
building has been put off yet another 
fiscal year— please make your 
knowledge public. 

For one more year, students will be 
cramped into an overcrowded painting 
class, inhaling the toxic fumes from oil- 
based paints, varnish and paint thinner, 
courtesy of inadequate ventilation. 

For one more year, figure-drawing 
students will huddle in a barely heated 
auditorium. It's not easy to draw with 
charcoal while wearing mittens, gang. 

For one more year, the sculpture 
students will have to work in a geodesic 
dome built to house less than half of the 
fledgling sculptors the class has 
attracted. 

Some people have argued that the fine 
arts departinent is in a historic area 
and has a lot of natural beauty, so it 
should stay downtown. It's easy to 
understand the beauty of the area when 
you aren't greeted every day by the less 
than lovely sights of falling plaster and 
peeling paint. 

However, the aesthetics of the site are 
not the only problem a fine arts building 

1 the main campus would solve. 



Students from both academic and fine 
arts disciplines have suffered as a result 
of the separation. 

The fine arts students have been 
denied the easy access of the larger 
library of the main campus and many 
are completely oblivious to most of the 
opportunities afforded them by the $20 
activity fee they've been shelling out as 
part of their tuition. 

The students on the main campus, 
who's days are routinely filled with 
lectures and books, have missed out on 
the stimulation of creating things out of 
their own imaginations 

Why is it taking so long to get the fine 
arts building built when it was originally 
proposed long ago"^ Are the students of 
each campus going to have to resort to 
lighting a fire under the proper 
personnel (the ones who can get the 
money needed) or go back to staging sit- 
ins reminiscent of the 1960s? 

It would even be nice to have an 
explanation as to why the money is not 
available to add the fine arts building at 
this time, 

Instead of being offered platitudes as 
towhy the money isn't here, why doesn't 
some brave soul step forward and 
explain, in his or her own words, why the 
building has been put back another fiscal 
year? Maybe we can arrange to have the 
names changed to protect the innocent.

Blacks are not just 
another minority 



r V 'I i{ ! 



,omfWOiccriD^ 



Through mass media productions 
such as the mini-series "Roots" and 
the motion picture film "The Color 
Purple," blacks have drawn attention 
nationwide to their varied and extensive 
history. But this isn't enough. 

Blacks are no longer just another 
minority. They are a moving force in 
America; in business, education and 
politics. Blacks in history aren't just 
former slaves, but leaders like Martin 
Luther King, Jr., and authors like Alex 
Haley. 

In honor of blacks throughout history, 
blacks across the country hold a month- 
long celebration, held in February, In 
past years events have included such 
things as performances by the Joseph 
Holmes Dance Troupe, plays by PIT, 
special black-oriented films and lectures 
by guest speakers 

In the past, speakers have included 
such names as Julian Bond, a Georgia 
Senator. This year, to stress blacks in 
education, the IPFW black alumni and 



the Black Collegian Caucus invited Dr. 
Raymond Burse, a Rhodes Scholar and 
president of Kentucky State University 
to lecture. 

This year's events include a southern 
baked goods sale in Kettler Hall on Feb. 
26, and on Feb. 17, the Black Collegian 
Caucus and the black alumni will meet 
for a luncheon. During the entire month, 
exhibits on the first and second floor of 
Kettler Hall will feature a display on the 
kings and queens of Africa, donated by 
Pamela an administrative assistant in 
.the lU School of Dentistry and ceramic 
'and wood pieces, donated by Geoffrey 
Kelsaw, a music major. Other items 
include a scroll of black history facts and 
artifacts donated by various blacks on 
campus. 

We encourage IPFW students, 
professors and administrators to stop by 
Kettler Hall, take a look at the displays, 
and purchase baked goods. You don't 
have to be black to experience black 
history month, EnjoyI

TotheEditor: 

For several minutes last night I tried to console a woman 
whom I had found lying face down on Washington Blvd. The 
accident had caused her to be thro\vn approximately 100 
feet, through the passenger window of her Ford Pinto. Her 
(ace, hand and legs were hurt. She was screaming out of her 
pain from the injuries and the cold dampness of the asphalt. 

Again and again I assured her that help would be here 
soon: "I can hear the ambulance coming; Please ...don't 
move! Everything's gonna be alright, .hang on!" 

Her blood began to pool beneath the soles of my shoes. As I 
stared numbly into the bright red outline of her blood against 
the white snow and dark street, I could not help but think that 
perhaps — maybe it was past time that we all began to use 
our seatbelts. 

Pray for her, 

Joseph R. Motherwell

Students can eat cheap on coupons 



By MICHELE SHAFFER 
Managing Editor 

Would you like to escort a 
guest to a local restaurant 
and gel that second meal 
free? 

You can through liie use of 
Dine-a-Mate coupons which 
Disabled Student Services 
will begm offering to 
students Feb. 10 torS12, said 
Barb Johnson, director of 
Disabled Student Services, 
They will be sold in the 
Sweete Shoppe in Walb 
Memorial Union, and the 
ground floor of Kettler Hall, 
The coupon books will also 
be available for sale through 
the student senators and the 
office of Disabled Student 
Services, said Johnson. 

The coupons offer discount 
meals al fast food 
restaurants, entertainment 
(sports and theatre), fine 
dining places and other local 
favorite restaurants — from 
Oley's Pizza to the Back 40 
Junction and The 

Moonraker. Johnson, putting 



it on the students' level, said 
that within the book, there 
are 16 Arby's coupons which 
offer two sandwiches tor the 
price of one. "Most coupons 
provide two for the price of 
one." added Johnson. 

The proceeds that 
Disabled Student Services 
earns from the sale of Dine- 
a-Male coupons will go 
toward the purchase of a 
Viewscan for the depart- 
ment, which costs about 
S2,000. It's a pretty ex- 
pensive piece of equip- 
ment," said Johnson about 
the Viewscan, which is part 
of a S5,000 VTS system the 
department hopes to 
eventually purchase

David Krouse's painting. 
Three Figures, the firsl 
place winner al the 51st 
Annual Tri Kappa Regional 
Artists Exhibition, Is a study 
of clear colors arranged in a 
cubist manner. 

"I focused on the three 
figures as a human still life. 
Everything is of equal im- 
portance—the colors, lines, 
subject matter ..." 

Krouse is a senior in the 
Bachelor of Fine Arts 
program, majoring in 
(surprise) painting. 

"I was very conscious of 
color and design elements 
while I was painting this," 
he explained, "the purpose 
of this painting is for people 
(0 look at and enjoy." 

Krouse has a very 
refreshing manner when he 
speaksabout his art. He isn't 
the type of artist to in- 



leliectualize alx)ut his art, 
but imposes size limitations 
upon himself to keep the 
challenge of painting alive. 



He 



striv. 



iate 



balanced paintings, utilizing 
the compositional devices 
he'slearned in class. 

"Noel iDusendschon) and 
George (McCullough) are 
great teachers They've 
been a great influence on me 
and my art. 1 have the best of 
two worlds— the ar- 
chitectural influence of Noel 
and the intimacy George 
brmgslohiswork." 

Not one to be a mercJnary, 
Krouse doesn't like to sell 
these paintings he creates in 
class, "f like to have them 
around the house." he said, 
"because it gives me a 
chronological view of my 
work over the years," 

He's been working on his 



degree for the last six or 
seven years, and hopes to 
finish up within this decade. 
The time he's spent under 
the tutelage of the fine arts 
department has paid off, 
Krouse is a very skilled 
painter Hedemonslrateshis 
knowledge of repetition in 
his painting. He utilizes 
curved lines, colored and 
light areas to involve the 
viewer in the entire painting. 
By using linear 

brush -strokes, he gives the 
three figures a stability of 
presence without having to 
physically build the paint up 
on the canvas, retaining the 
flat characteristic of 
cubism. 

This painting may be seen 
at the Museum of Art for the 
duration of the Tri Kappa 

Show. 





Moses leads trip 

By SEBASTIAN CHAPMAN 
Starr Writer 

May 19 through June 12, Mayor Winfield Moses will lead a 
delegation of "goodwill ambassadors" on a sister cities tour 
of Takaoka, Japan, and three other Japanese cities. 

IPFW students, staff and faculty snatched up the last four' 
reservations for (2,150 per person for the limited capacity '. 
affair, said sister cities committee member Mary Brant. 

The delegation will be confronted with a "completely 
different lifestyle," said Brant. She has taken two sistercily 
tours of Japan and said, "It's increased by understanding of 
the similarities as well as the differences in the nations. Any 
kind of international exchange will benefit In an educational 
and cultural way." 

Several area high schools share active sister school 
relations with Takaoka, In January 19B2, the wrestling team 
from Takaoka Technological visited Snider. Students from 
Korya visited Northside the following September, and in the 
spring of 1984 students from Takaoka Commercial visited 
Elmhurst. That summer, four students and a teacher from 
Northside were in residence at Koryo, Japan. 

The city has been described by its mayor of over thirty 
years, Kenji Mori, as a "city abundant with sunshine, 
greenery, clear water, and friendly people." Economic 
development has been a high priority in Takaoka, Copper, 
laquer ware and textile printing are traditional industrial 
and commercial products. Recently, the aluminum, paper, 
yulp, chemical, metal working and heavy machinery in- 
dustries have flourished. 

Located on the seaside of central Honshu, the city of three 
rivers covers an area of 58.32 square miles and has a 
population of 200,000. one of the similarities it si 
Fort Wayne.

Washington, Leathers lead Mastodons 



By TONV DUNAVVAV 
StBlf Writer 

The men's basketball 
team played three games 
last week losing two and 
winning one, their only 
conference match-up. 

On Jan. 27 the Mastodons 
fell lo Tri-Slale University. 
B6-B1. Qiarles Washington 
scored a career-high 2C 
points and grabbed eight 
rebounds lo lead the 
Mastodon attack. 1( was the 
second lime Tri-Slste 
defeated IPFW this season. 

On Jan, 30, Schann 
Leathers netted 25 poinls as 
Ihe Mastodons came from 
behind lo defeat conference 
foe Northern Kentucky. 
Leathers was 10-12 from the 



field and scored 15 of his 
points in the second half. 

The Mastodons trailed 22- 
la in the first half, before 
they began to get themselves 
back into the game, and had 
cut the lead to 29-26 at the 
half 

Early in the second half, 
the Norsemen began lo pull 
away again as Willie 
Schiarman, who scored a 
game-high 26 points, sunk 
his first three attempts of the 
half, Northern Kentucky led 
47-38 with 12 minutes 
remaining when the 
Mastodons began Iheir final 
run and with 8; 18 lelt in the 
game, Leathers put IPFW 
ahead for the first time, 48- 



Sleve Driver canned two 
free throws with eight 
seconds left in the game to 
score whal was to be the 
winning points, 

Scotl Reed also added 15 
poinls, of which seven were 
from the foul stripe in seven 
attempts, as the Mastodons 
and the Norsemen had to 
settle for a split in their two 
meetings this year. 

Last Saturday Central 
State defeated IPFW for tlie 
second time this season, by a 
score of 59-56. 

Schann Leathers led the 
Mastodons to a halftime lead 
of 33-22 with 12 of his game- 



high 16 points. And IPFW 
pulled away to a 41-28 lead 
with 14:30 left in the game. 

The Marauders displayed 
a lot of maturity and did not 
panic as they climbed back 
into the game and pulled into 
a 54-54 tie with 4 minutes 
remaining, lliey then took a 
51-56 lead with only 19 
seconds left in the game. 

Coach Russell's big 
concern is lo hold onto a lead 
once the learn has it. If the 
Mastodons could learn lo 
master this, they could very 



well have a 16-1 record in- 
stead of Iheir present 7-13 
record. The potential for a 
good team is there but the 
MasUxlons have some ob- 
stacles toe 



CONFERENCE NOTES: 
Lawrence Jordan is listed 
sixth in assists wilh 5,3 per 
game and Bruce Erwin is 
eighth in rebounds with 6.2 
per contest, followed by Jim 
Morlan who is lOth with 5.9. 
The Mastodons are second in 
team defense allowing only 
64,5 points a game, but are 
last in offense, scoring 61,5, 



Lady 'Dons led by Lydy 



ByTONYDUNAWAV 
Stofl Writer 

On Jan. 28, the Lady 
Mastodons traveled across 
town lo take on Indiana Tech 
and came away defeated, 67- 



In a close-scoring, 
physical game, IPFW let a 
14 point lead slip through iu 

Tmgers. 

The Lady Mastodons 
leading scorer and 
rebounder was Terri Lydy 
with 21 and 10 respectively, 
but Michelle Foltz, Lori 
Miller and Chris Bonahoom 
also scored in double figures. 

The Lady Maslodons 
finished the game with 22 
team fouls as compared to 
the Lady Warrior's 13 in a 
very physical game. 

The Lady Mastodons' 
second gome of the week 
saw them falling in defeat to 
Northern Kentucky 72-54. 
Pam King led all scorers 
wilh 29, as Northern Ken- 
tucky dominated the game 
throughout and left no doubt 



as to why they are ranked 
number seven in the nation 
according to a U.P.I, poll. 

Terri Lydy was the leading 
scorer, with 19 points, and 
rebounder, with 10, for 
IPFW. 

Coach Julie Calahan 
noted, "The officiating in the 
Tech game was very 
questionable, but the same 
officials who were there 
when we lost by two, were 
there when we led by 14. This 
is something we have to live 
wilh and go on." In ref- 
erence to Norlliern Ken- 
tucky, Coach Calahan also 
said, "They are good, right 
now the best in the con- 
ference, and they just out- 
played us." 

The Athletic Department 
and The Communicator 
would like to express 
sympathy to Bev Miller at 
the loss of her father this 
week. 

CONFERENCE NOTES: 
Terri Lydy a freshman 
from Heritage is second 
in the conference in 



rebounding with an 8.6 
average and ninth in scoring 
witli 14.5 points an outing.
