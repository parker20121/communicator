Campus parking: What's the lowdown? 



by MishannaWood, 
News Editor 



"A" parking versus "B" parking: 
What's the difference? 

"A" parking is designated for 
staff and faculty (not including stu- 
dent workers) and "B" parking is set 
- aside for students. 

"A" permits cost S84 for a full 
year of classes, including summer ses- 
sions, and S42 for a partial year of 
classes. 

For the 1998-99 semesters, stu- 
dents are charged S2.35 per credit 
hour for "B" permits. 

According to Lt. Tom Haner, day 
shift supervisor at Police and Safety,

students usually complain about park- 
ing in the beginning of the semesters. 

In the fall of 1998 there were 
10,653 students enrolled at IPFW. 

This includes all students, full- 
time, part-time and graduate. 

According to Lt. Haner, there were 
938 "A" permits for the current semes- 
ter. 

Police and Safety conducted an 
"A" and "B" parking survey during the 
third week of classes in the fall semes- 
ter. 

Mere is what they found: 

First there are a total of 4,775 
parking spaces for "A," "B," free spots, 
meter and handicapped, 

Between the hours of 7 a.m. and 5 
p.m., there are 610 "A" spots and 
3,484 "B" spots. 

After 5 p.m. there are 3,813 "B" 
spots and 281 "A" spots. 

However, according to Walter 
Branson, vice chancellor of financial 
affairs, these totals will vary with the 
construction of new buildings. 

"A" Lou 4,8, and 9 convert to "B" 
after 5 p.m 

The total amount of "B" spaces in 
Garage 1 is 750 and 950 in Garage 2 
between the hours of 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. 

There are 87 "A" spots for Garage 
1 and 49 spaces for Garage 2. These 
convert to "B" parking after 5 p.m. 

Haner found that Tuesdays and 
Thursdays were the busiest days of all. 

On the Tuesday during the third 
week of the semester, from 9 a.m. to 1 
p.m., there were no "B" parking spaces 
available in Lots 4 and 5, which are 
east of the Engineering Building. 

Parking Garage 1 {the old parking 
garage), had 15 spaces open at 10 a.m. 

The new parking garage, Garage 
2, had 350 spaces open at 1 p.m. 

On Wednesday of the third week 
of the fall semester, the survey found 
the following results from 8 a,m. to 7 
p.m. for Lot 10, which is between the 
river and the Life Sciences Resources 
Center: 

At 8 a.m., there were 14 "A" and 
zero "B"; 10 a.m., four "A" and zero 
"B"; 12 p.m., 11 "A" and 117 "B"; 3 
p.m.. three "A" and 79 "B"; 5 p.m., 
seven "A" and six "B" and at 7 p.m.,, 
four "A" and 31 "B." 

"Students have not jet com- 
plained this semester; in the fall, the; 
complain. They don't seem to know 



where the north Iols are," Haner said. 

Haner concluded that most of the 
classes are on the south side of cam- 
pus and everyone wants to park as 
closely as possible. 

His advice to students was this: 
"Going to a north parking" space will 
save a student time rather than wait- 
ing for a space that may not become 
available." 

r According to Branson, parking 
lots are added as enrollment increases. 

The lots are being built toward 
the northern part of campus to 
accommodate future buildings. 

"It was a premium before the new 
parking garage, but now there is plen- 
ty of parking for faculty and stu- 
dents," Branson said. 

The students' views on this topic 
were varied. 

"There's plenty of parking, but 
people don't want to walk. I always 
park on the third floor of the new 
parking garage," Jason Roebel, a sena- 
tor of IPSGA, said. 

"There's definitely too much "A" 
parking; it never gets filled up before 
5 p.m. If anything, they need more 
handicapped parking," Brandy Becker, 
a sophomore majoring in psychology, 
said. 

"There are more spots here than at 
Purdue. It seems like you have to park 
six miles away there ," Travis Btume, a 
sophomore majoring in engineering, 
said. 

"We need closer student parking. 
The faculty are here longer so they 
should be able to walk the distance 
that we walk. The fine Arts parking lot 
is ideal," Courtney Nardin, a sopho- 
more majoring in fine arts, said. 

"I don't have a problem with 
parking. I always get here early in the 
morning and there are plenty avail- 
able," Dawn Albertson, a junior major- 
ing in math, said. 

"I've gone here since 1993. They 
should not have taken out the parking 
lot by the Science Building. That took 
away from our parking and now we 
have to fight for it," Jennifer Jacobs, a 
sophomore majoring in engineering, 
said. 

For more details on parking, one 
can pick up a "1998-99 University 
Police and Safety Emerge ncj 
Information" pamphlet located 
throughout campus.

A love for the theatre is honored 



by Carrie Anne Leathers, 
Chief Reporter 

After more than ten 
years of assisting and work- 
ing with the Kennedy 
Center/American College 
Theatre Festival, Steve 
Sarratore, associate dean of 
Fine and Performing Arts, 
received the organization's 
annual Gold Award of 
Excellence. 

"Since 1988, I've been 
involved in a lot of differ- 
ent ways, both hosting two 
festivals here and respond- 
ing to other productions," 
Sarratore said. 

Responding to produc- 



tions involves traveling to 
other universities and col- 
leges and working with stu- 
dents on their own original 
plavs. Students

Sarratore said. associate dean, 

"It gives stu- 
dents and facul- 



ty chances to be recognized 

for their work." 

Although Sarratore is 

pleased to have received 
the award, 
according to 
him, he is 
most pleased 
to be a part 
of the festi- 
val. 

"One 
of the great 
things about 
the festival is 
the friends 
that I've 

made," 
Sarratore 
Fine and Performing Arts said. "I 

wouldn't do 



this if it wasn't a lot of 
fun — the award was just a 
bonus." 

Sarratore is also work- 
ing on his own play that 
deals with anti-Semitism in 
America. 

"The Protocols of the 
Learned Elders of Zion" 
deals with anti-semitic 
groups in America today," 
Sarratore said. "I had a 
reading of it done last fall 
at the Indiana Theatre 
Works Conference." 

Currently, Sarratore is 
Play writing Chair for 
Region III and as well a 
member of the National 
KC/ACTF Playwriting 
Awards Committee. 



New president takes advantage of opportunity 



by Mishanna Wood, 
News Editor 



IPSGA has had another change in 
leaders. 

On Jan. 7, former vice president 
Joseph Schrocder was officially sworn in 
as president. 

According to the IPSGA constitution, 
the vice president moves to the presiden- 
cy by order of succession. 

The former president, Chuck 
Newman, made the decision to resign so 
he could give more time to his cbsswork. 

"I was not planning on being presi- 
dent this past semester. Three months 
after I'm sworn as vice president I became 
president. 1 focused more on my responsi- 
bilities to student government than I did 
to my studies," Newman said. "I may get 



involved with an engineering/technology 
group. This is less stressful than being 
president. I'll set back and leave things go 
as they go." 

A few of the new president's plans 
are to work with the department budgets. 
fill judicial court spots and obtain student 
involvement by recruitment in classes, 
letters to The Communicator and person- 
al friends. 

"I think he'll make a great president 
and move the student government associ- 
ation forward this semester," Frank 
Borclli, vice chancellor of student affairs, 
said. 

Anyone interested in being a senator 
can stop by the student government 
office at Walb Rm. 225. 

To run for senate or Student 
Activities Board candidates must have a 
petition with 50 signatures, pass a grade 
check and declare what year they are in 



and what their major is. 

"I'm looking for- 
ward to being president 
and am excited about 
the opportunity ." 

Schroeder said. 

Schroeder wishes to 
fulfill his duties this 
semester and keep the 
position as long as pos- 
sible. 

The problem relat- 
ed to filling the vacant 
\ice presidency has 
been resolved. 



Senators who run for vice president 
will be chosen at the senate meeting on 
Monday, Jan. 25. 

On Feb. 21, the new vice president 
will be elected by the members of IPSGA. 




Music educator 
receives award 



by Carrie Anne Leathers, 
Chief Reporter 



Because of her excel- 
lence in teaching, assistant 
professor and Coordinator of 
Music Education Barbara 
Resell was awarded with the 
first-ever "Dean's Award for 
Excellence in Teaching." 

"In her role in the music 
education program she does 
so much great work— not 
only in her classroom, but 
with all of the student teach- 
ers on sight and with coordi- 
nating their placement with 
teachers," associate dean of 
the School of Fine and 
Performing Arts Steve 
Sarratore said. 

The School of Fine and 
Performing Arts initiated the 
award to encourage and rec- 
ognize outstanding teaching. 
According to Resch, the 
award was very reassuring. 

"I fell it was an affirma- 
tion of what 1 love to do the 



most here," Resch said. "I 
love to teach and m&gt; 
favorite time is always in the 
classroom." 

Besides teaching, Resch 
works with students to find 
job placements. Prior to this, 
she helps them get placed 
for student teaching. 

"I've never had a 
teacher out in the field say 
they wouldn't accept one of 
our student teachers," Resch 
said. "The community is a 
very strong supporter of 
what we're doing here." 

Although Resch 
received the award, she says 
that nothing will change. 

She plans to continue to 
provide her students with 
up-to-date information on 
the field of music education. 

"I want to continue to 
present the best current 
music education information 
to students," Resch said. "We 
are turning out excellent 
teachers here."

TOPIC: 

The recent weather 

WHAT WE THINK: 

City employees and other 
gooa Samaritans have done 
an excellent job dealing with 
the snow that suddenly was 
dumped on us 



Unless you've been out of town 
for the past few weeks, you proba- 
bly noticed that we've had quite a 
bit of poor weather recently. 

We at The Communicator have 
noticed, as most of us were out 
there with you shoveling our drive- 
ways, brushing the snow off of our 
cars, and scraping the ice off of our 
windshields. 

The weather, to say the least, 
has been intolerable, and although 
walking in this weather is bad 
enough, driving in it is even worse. 
The number of car accidents due to 
weather-related reasons is rocketing 
through the roof and instances of 
road rage are even higher, or so it 
would appear. 

As bad as the weather has 
made the roads, however, one 
would hardly notice now. 

With exception to a little slush 
on the main roads and small patch- 
es of ice found on the back roads, 



the roads are driveable once again. 

Instances of accidents have 
declined, road rages are back to 
their obscenely high (though aver- 
age) level, and car drivers can once 
again gas and brake without fear of 
sliding into other cars or, in some 
cases, buildings. 

No longer, to our knowledge, 
can be found the car with spinning 
tires trying to get to work, school or 
home. 

No longer can be found the 
once prevalent image of the tow 
truck pulling the latest victim of the 
weather out of the ditch. 

Looking around for someone to 
thank, we have only come up with 
one group of people- the tireless 
road workers of Allen Count)\ 

These good Samaritans, man- 
aged to keep the inconveniences of 
numerous inches of snow and ice 
dumped on the city to a minimum. 

Their ranks were comprised of 
the average guy with a truck or 
lawnmower equipped with a plow 
with a little bit of extra time on his 
hands to paid city workers, 
equipped with heavy snow-moving 
equipment. 

All of them, from low-tech to 
high-tech worker, had the common 
goal of resurrecting a city 
enshrouded under a blanket of 
snow. As far as we could see, they 
accomplished their goal. Fort 
Wayne only remained shut down 
for a matter of days, whereas other 
communities that were hit just as 



hard were shut down for much 
longer. 

The effects of this resurrection 
were even evident in our very own 
campus. 

Merely days after the initial 
snowstorm that paralyzed 
Northeast Indiana had struck, the 
parking lots and roads connecting 
IPFW's campus together had already 
been cleared, leaving behind moun- 
tains of snow where a driving night- 
mare had once been. 

Although none of us was 
around to witness this miraculous 
clearing and we have no idea who 
to individually thank, we do owe 
someone a thank you for doing this 

We also believe that the entin 
city of Fort Wayne owes these peo 
pie a thank you since the) belong 
to the same guild of workers that 
freed our city from the raptures of 
Jack Frost. 

The snow plowers, the bulldoz- 
ers, and the plow-equipped lawn 
mower drivers are all well worthy 
of our gratitude. 

The snow shovelers, the snow 
blowers, and the salt throwers are 
all welt worthy of our gratitude. 

The tow trucks and the 
pushers are all well worthy of our 
gratitude. 

Without the help of the 
Samaritans, our lives would still be 
confined by snow. 

Thanks to all of you. 



Commentary 




Everyday Epiphanies 



by Gail Ruble-Crawford, 
Editor 



"Any man's death 
diminishes me, 
because I am 
involved in 
mankind..." 

-John Donne 

"If animals are 
deprived of hope 
(as well as of 
fear), they are 
compensated by 
being given an 
almost endless 
patience for 
enduring, or sim- 
ply for waiting." 

-Joseph Wood 
Km ten 



I've never been good 
at dealing with death. The 
closer the loss, the more 
that 1 feel as though I've 
lost something inside 
myself. Be it human or 
animal, I grieve for what 
I've lost, like any normal 
human would. 

On Friday, my hus- 
band and 1 made the deci- 
sion to have our 4-year- 
old dog put to sleep. We 
didn't do this because he 
was sick (although I wish 
that he had been), but 
because he was aggressive, 
and we were terrified that 
he was going to bite some- 
one that we loved. We had 
considered this option 
about a year ago, but 
decided that it was in 
both his best interest and 
ours to try to find some 
kind of alternative solu- 
tion. 

We put him through 
some more training, 
which he aced. However, 
he was always an exem- 
plar)' dog in his training 
classes. He always man- 
aged to be the instructor's 
favorite because he was 



smart and obedient, and a 
bit of a show-off. When 
training didn't curb his 
snapping tendencies, we 
went so far as to buy a 
shock collar, which nei- 
ther my husband or I 
believe in. It worked for 
awhile, but it too failed in 
the end. 

Giving a dog a shock 
doesn't stop him from try- 
ing to bite strangers and 
children. That's some- 
thing that comes from 
inside him, and you can't 
make that instinct go 
away by training or pun- 
ishing. 

So, faced with no 
other choice, we decided 
to have him put down. I 
cried for at least an hour, 
and then put on a happy 
face, and went into the 
kitchen to play with him. I 
felt guilty, and I know that 
he could tell that some- 
thing was wrong. He was 
always good about read- 
ing my reelings. 

1 Kept telling myself 
that we were doing the 
right thing. That was the 
only way that I could live 
with myself. I felt callous, 
but I knew that I'd never 
be able to go through with 
it if 1 didn't find some way 
to make this acceptable to 
my heart. I knew that I'd 
just fall apart if he bit one 
of my nephews or nieces 
or my best friend, so I had 
to find a way to make 
peace with it. I figured 
that, if 1 told mvself these 
things enough, I'd be able 
to live with myself and 
not feel as if I was bet rav- 
ing him. 

My husband took him 
to the vet on Friday. 1 
stood at the kitchen win- 
dow, crying. I secretly 
hoped that my husband 
would return with him 
still in the car, or that my 
husband would chicken 
out and refuse to do it. 
But he came home alone, 
holding Andre's collar and 
lease. My husband's eyes 
were reel, and I could tell 



that he had been crying. 
He threw the leash and 
collar into the trash, and I 
snatched it out before it 
hit the bottom. I couldn't 
bear to throw his things 
away so soon. 

I gathered up his 
squeak) toys and his one- 
month-old doggy bed and 
put them into the corner 
of our laundry room. My 
husband wanted to put 
them up, probably so that 
he didn't have to .see 
them, but I wanted them 
in full view until 1 was 
oka)- with putting them 
up. 

1 swept up his fur 
from our kitchen floor 
one last lime. This was the 
first time that my kitchen 
floor in my new house 
had been clear of doggy 
fur in over three years, 
but 1 hated the cleanli- 
ness. 1 hated that he was- 
n't there. I hated the 
silence, the lack of doggy 
smell and the absence of 
doggy breath. 

Our house just feels 
lonely now. It's too quiet 
in the morning after my 
husband leaves for work. 
I'm used to the dog wak- 
ing me up and demanding 
to go outside. I actually 
got misty-eyed when it 
started raining over the 
weekend, because it melt- 
ed away his paths and 
tracks in the yard. I even 
ran out and snatched up 
one of his toys that the 
melting snow revealed. It 
was as if 1 was afraid that 
the snow would wash that 
away, too. I put the toy in 
the 'sink to thaw out and 
then added it to his little 
pile in the laundry room. 

It's strange- it looks 
as if he's coming back any 
time now. His toys are all 
gathered together. I can't 
even bring myself to wash 
his bed yet; I'm just not 
ready to eliminate ever)' 
trace of him. That feels 
too harsh. 

It doesn't feel right to 
just pretend that he was 



never a part of our lives. I 
can't do that. To me and 
my husband, he was a 
person, he was our child. 

I start getting tears in 
my eyes just thinking 
about htm in his last few- 
minutes and that makes 
me feel like a horrible 
person. The thought of 
him being cremated both- 
ers me. I Y m grieving over 
him just 1 as I would a 
human being. I may feel 
guilt)- about a lot of 
things, but I'll never feel 
guilty about that. 

Loss is loss— if you 
make an animal a part of 
your family, and treat him 
as you would your own 
child, then, yes, it is 
painful to lose that love. 1 
miss knowing that, 
regardless of what other 
chaos there was in my life, 
he was always waiting 
there for me at home. 1 
could always count on 
that to be a constant in 
my life, and it was com- 
forting. He kept me safe 
and he loved me as if I 
was the most important 
thing in his life. I miss 
being loved uncondition- 
ally. 

I've decided to keep 
his favorite squeak)' toy as 
a reminder of how much 
he was loved. Maybe that 
seems weird, but my hus- 
band understands even if 
no one else does. I still 
keep expecting his 80- 
pound head to pop up 
when I walk into the 
kitchen. I still think that I 
hear his breathing at 
night. 

Heck, even our cats 
seem to understand that 
he's gone. The male cat 
(who hated the dog) has 
started growling when 
strangers visit. It's as if he 
doesn't feel as safe as he 
did before. Neither do I. 
Hopeful!) 1 , there will come 
a time when I can write 
about this and not start 
crying ten times. But until 
that day comes, 1 will miss 
him terribly.

CD Review: My Friend Steve curbs the isolation of winter 



by Adam Taylor 
Feaiures Editor 



As winter has finally come, a 
chilling wind gusts at the win- 
dow and memories of last winter 
auickly come to mind. Even 
though it may seem like an eter- 
nity in the past, it doesn't take 
much to realize it reallv wasn't 
that long ago. Especially if you 
look at the short history of the 
new band "My Friend Steve," 
from Mammoth Records. 

My Friend Steve, a five man 
band from central Florida, didn't 
even know each other last win- 
ter. In fact, despite having heard 
of each other, the) didn t even 
meet until February. 

Lead singer Steve Burry, 
from whom (he band takes its 
name, had spent the past few 
years headlining with various 
bands backing him up through- 
out his hometown of Orlando 
and all over central Florida. As 
Burry watched his bands come 
and go, three men (Eric 
Steinberg, Dave McMahon, and 
Pat Koch) were making a huge 
success out of music in 
Gainesville under the name Big 
White Undies. It was around this 



time that Burry's single "The 
Schooling" was finally getting 
some air time on a local radio 
station. The four music 
finally got together, 
ing an incredible 
sound reflecti' 
their individual 
ents. 

Not long after 
meeting, Burr; 
S i e i n b e r _' 
McMahon, and 
Koch all found 
themselves 
playing in 
Orlando's 
House of Blues. 
They all han- 
dled the vocals, 
with Burry and 
Steinberg on gui 
tar, Koch on ke; 
boards, McMahi 
on the bass, an 
drummer Giti Khalsa 
from Seven Mar; 
Three filling in on the 
drums. The performance 
lasted a half an hour and they 
walked out of the House of Blues 
that night as the latest addition 
to Mammoth Records. By mid- 
June, they picked up Eric 
Gardner on drums and percus- 




recording 
their first album, 

"Hope &amp; Wait." 

The album, symbolically 
enough, starts out with the track 



that was playing on Orlando's 
WSHE when the band first came 
together. 

"The Schooling,'' written and 
first put out by Burn, is a sharp 
poetic mix ofword's that, cou- 
pled with a penetrating instru- 
mental background, signals 
frustration with pain, and 
comes across as very moving. 
Although this' motif is, 
for the most part, followed 
on the remainder of the 
album, My Friend Steve 
proves their ability to jam 
on the second track, aptly 
named "Charmed." Being 
basicallv about envy of an 
easy life, the song' starts 
out like a fast Counting 
Crows song and fails to 
waiver through the end. 
Drummer Eric Gardner defi- 
nitely makes his presence 
known on this song. 

On top of "Charmed," the 
songs "Lessening Mercies" and 
"Always the Way" are undeni- 
ably great songs. 

"Lessening Mercies," follow- 
ing the general theme of the 
frustration surrounding life 
found on the rest of the album 
(the album's title was taken from 
a children's book on virtue and 



patience), deals directly with the 
pain of life, asking "After the 
aging's done/wonder how much 
I'll miss." 

The hypnotizing sounds of 
"Always the Wav" are sure to win 
a place in the fislener's heart as 
well, proving to be just as sooth- 
ing as they are melodic. If music 
really do'es sooth the savage 
beast, this song could lame a 
rabid lion. 

My Friend Steve has no doubt 
been busy since the August 
release of "Hope &amp; Wait." 

In November alone, they 
toured through four stales on 
top of a stop in Toronto, Canada. 

Their only stop in Indiana 
during the on-the-road celebra- 
tion they've been having found 
them playing at 1'ierc's Friday, 
Nov. 20, with fellow Mammoth 
Record recording arlist Seven 
Mary Three — whose drummer 
played with them at their first 
live appearance back in Orlando. 

If their live performance is 
half as good as their debut 
album is, it would serve one well 
to keep track of when the band 
expects to make it back to the 
area. 

My Friend Steve is undeni- 
ably a band to check out.

Fiction 



A Second Chance: Prelude to Life After Death 



by Adam Taylor 
Features Editor 



As Mark looked oul his win- 
dow, the fog quietly descended 
upon ihe river his apartment 
overlooked 

Gazing towards the river, Mark 
thought to himself how symbolic it 
was that what was normally a beau- 
tiful view was enshrouded with fog 
this dark February night 

It was on nights such as this 
that Mark would turn to the river for 
support, hoping lo find an answer in 
its gentle waves for whatever dilem- 
ma was plaguing him at the time. 

Now the answer was as 
shrouded In nature as it was in 
Mark's head. 

With a sigh. Mark turned to his 
backup plan— a couple of bottles of 
whiskey. 

During normal times, he 
wouldn't resort to such a low, but as 
he saw it, his problems were too 
numerous for him to fall asleep like 
a normal person would. 

He had a phone bill, an elec- 
tric bill, and rent (o attempt to cover, 
but had no way in which he could 
pull it off. 

That is to say, none that he 
could think of 

Normally, his late-night think- 
ing sessions with the river would be 
enough to formulate a plan, but the 
river proved to be just as cloudy as 
his mind was at the moment 

That is why he consequently 
felt the urge to turn to the bottle — 
the only thing he knew of that was 
capable of cutting through the cloud 
that enveloped his mind. 

His rainy-day stash, his last- 
minute go-to-guy, whiskey would 
become his chief counsel lor the 
evening and, subsequently, the 
supposed solution to all of his 
problems. 

His evening counsel had never 
permitted failure in the past and 
would hardly permit it now, when 
Mark needed success the most. He 
was at his wit's end and would stop 
at nothing to see the solution to all 
of his problems 

It was thus with an overly- 
ambitious nature that Mark turned to 
the first of two whiskey bottles as a 
means to solve his problems. 

It may have seemed an irra- 
tional way of solving his problems at 
the time, but Mark was at the end of 
his rope 

He couldn't find a job to save 



the life of him, he couldn't sell any- 
thing more without going homeless, 
and he couldn't sell anymore blood 
without being dead 

His careless budgeting and 
crude manners at the workplace 
had once again gotten hrm in over 
his head, this time leaving him with- 
out a job and with bills larger than 
his present yearly income to look 
forward to 

Mark was. as one would say, 
'up a river without a paddle ' 

With all of this weighing down 
upon his mind. Mark uncapped the 
bottle of whiskey that he had 
marked with Ihe words "Only if you 
REALLY need it- 
He had his experience with 
drinking but never under such lurid 
circumstances. Before, he had 
always viewed drinking as a way to 
■fit in" among his peers, as a sort of 
a social stimulus 

Now it seemed as though he 
was forced to do it to keep his head 
afloat in the rrver of destitution that 
he was slowly succumbing lo. 

As he took his first drink from 
the bottle, his focus was quickly 
killed 

He no longer dwelled so much 
on what his problems were, choos- 
ing instead to dwell upon when the 
next drink would be taken. 

He quickly took another drink, 
followed soon thereafter by another 
drink; an hour later, he found him- 
self already done with a fifth of 
whiskey 

Just as easy as he reached 
the end of the first bottle, he tore 
into the second as though it were a 
check he had been waiting to cash 
for days 

He no longer had any idea as 
to why he was punishing himself by 
drinking more, but rather, focused 
more and more upon his goal of fin- 
ishing the second nfth of whiskey 
before the night was over 

It may have been poor judge- 
men!, but at the time, he no longer 
cared All he cared about was fin- 
ishing that second bottle, no matter 
what the cost 

It was thus towards the end of 
the bottle that he felt himself going 
down. 

Spiraling. he could no more 
get sick as he could keep himself in 
a vertical position 

He felt as though his entire 
world was one gigantic top — spin- 
ning constantly with no end until 
finally, everything quit moving. 



Mark, after drinking nearly half 
a gallon of whiskey in merely a few 
hours, was out cold and lifeless in 
the middle of his bedroom floor 

The next thing Mark knew, a 
feeling of severe cold enveloped his 
body and a voice was telling him to 
get up off the floor 

Rising to his feet, Mark first 
looked around the room lo try to 
place the voice and. finding no one, 
looked down to where he previously 
was Laying at his feet Mark saw his 
own body, pate and covered in per- 
spiration. Noticing Ihe lack of move- 
ment in the rib cage, he became 
lightheaded and fell backwards into 
the dead air 

'Oh God!' he cried as he tried 
to pull himself together. He was 
staring at his own dead corpse 

'Your god cannot hear you 
anymore. Mark.' a voice calmly 
replied to Mark's scream. 

The voice came from within 
the room, but from no identifiable 

Recognizing the voice Irom 
before as being the one to wake 
him, Mark scrambled upright in a 
panic lo address it 

'Who are you?" Mark called 
out frantically into the 
darkness. 

"Who I am is of no relevance 
to you," the voice returned "For 
your own petty knowledge, howev- 
er. I have many names and hold 
many mediums— the most common 
being Pestilence. Oecay. and Fear. 
I am also known as Destiny, he 
whom every man meets at the 
demise of the empire they labeled 




life.* 

'What name may I call you by, 
then?" Mark asked the voice. 

'You will not call me anything, 
as you will not be addressing me I 
will answer one question for you — 
the one question that has been on 
your mind since first you rose and 
saw the horror at your feel. This 
answer should be plainly obvious to 
you, given the facts coupled wrth my 
monologue You are in a very pre- 
carious position— not quite dead, 
though not quite alive I will now tell 
you what happened, though I'm 
sure if you are halfway intelligent 
you could figure that oul yourself" 

Mark leaned himself against 
the wall as a figure materialized 
from out of the shadows As Mark 
began to rise to his feet to greet the 
figure, the figure spoke to him in the 
same voice Mark had been speak-

ing to before 'Remain seated. 
Mark." the voice said with stern 
authority, causing Mark to fall in a 
slump against the wall. "I will now 
speak to you on why we have met. 
so pay close attention 

"Mark." the figure spoke, 
"instead of mastering your life, you 
have allowed life to master you The 
consequences, as you now know, 
have proved to be fatal In attempt- 
ing to find an answer in your liquor, 
you have set yourself up for our 
meeting via poisoning That type of 
behavior, although I have no per- 
sonal problem with the outcome, is 
completely irresponsible and com- 
pletely irrational. In attempting (o 
find an answer, you created a new 
problem — your death It is now my 
job to fix that problem ' 

'Fix that problem?' Mark 
asked with curiosity 'If I'm dead 
already, what can you do to fix that 
problem?' 

'You are not dead until I say 
you are allowed to be dead," the fig- 
ure spoke back to him 

'What If I want to remain 
dead?" Mark asked, seeing a possi- 
ble opportunity in his death. 

"I have seen your future, Mark, 
and your future is not in death Your 
life has yet to prove useful. You will 
not leave this conversation, nor this 
day. dead.' 

"Whoa, wait a minute." Mark 
said, wishing to get to the point. 
"You know my future^ What's going 
to be so great for me to go back to? 
What's going to happen to me that 
will have such an impact on my 
future? Why have you been sent 
here, and who has sent you?" 

"I need no reason lo be here, 
just as the locusts need no reason 



to spread destruction or the rats, 
plague All you need to know is that 
you are going to master your life, 
Mark, and you cannot do this in 
your present condition " 

"And how is that relevant to 
you? Why am I being given a sec- 
ond chance?' 

"Your early death provides me 
no benefit, Mark Should you master 
your life, however, and follow your 
dreams of an advanced degree, 
your existence could then resemble 
my own and benefit everyone great- 
ly." 

"In what way?" Mark asked, 
intrigued by the figure's answer 

"It is not for man to know what 
his destiny is," the figure said 'It is 
only for man to know that a destiny 
does exist for him and that it is in 
his better interest to follow thai des- 
tiny It is man's decision lo meet his 
destiny, just as it is my decision for 



man to meet me I will meet you 
again soon, Mark Goodbye" 

As the figure disappeared into 
the shadows from whence it came, 
Mark felt a tingling sensation and he 
fell fast asleep, only to wake up in 
the middle of the floor of his bed- 
room once again 

He looked around the room 
and at his feet, only lo find that he 
was once again all alone 

With a deep sigh, he stumbled 
over to where his nearly empty bot- 
tle of whiskey lay and picked it up 

Taking it lo the bathroom, the 
contents of the bottle found a new 
resting place in his sink. 

Purposefully, he threw the 
empty bottle away and went back lo 
bed Tomorrow would soon be 
today

The IPFW mens volleyball 
team has been one of the 
toughest teams in the last 
decade as any team known in 
sports. 

This year the Dons should 
have the same kind of success. 

It has five of its si\ 
starters returning and another 
strong class of freshmen. 

Jeff Ptak, Aris 
Eracleous and Josh Sanders all 



are expected to con- 
tribute quality minutes 
and vital roles in the 
team's success this sea- 

The Dons will be 
tested early when the\ 
host =6 Ohio State on 
Jan. 29 and travel to 
Penn State on Feb. 19. 

Both the 

Buckeyes and Nittany 
Lions will have their 
eyes on seniors Javier 
Escobar, Ryan Perrotte 
and juniors Chris 
Gisslen and Hector 
Soto. 

Escobar escalates 
with his 48-inch verti- 
cal which, coupled 
with his quickness,

Perroie is a leader on the

ter setters in the 
conference. 

He rallies his team behind 
htm and does a good job of 
delivering the ball. 

Soto is a fan favorite. He 
is the target of the opposing 
team's defenders. 

As an outside hitter, he 
brings 6.49 kills per game and 
will be the go-to-guy for the 
'Dons. 

Soto will no doubt again 
be an Ail-American and will be 
looking for a teammate to join 
him, along with bringing his 
own team some success. 

Don't be surprised if the 
team continues the success it 
had in '94- if the team can 
stay healthy and focused on 
the opponents it will face.

Man with the Mike 



Athletics another one of the many opportunities getting 
disregarded here at IPFW 

by Brian Miller, 

Sports Edilor 



It really bothers me when I 
walk into the G.ttes Sports Center at 
every sporting event and all I see are 
a handful of IPPW fans and empty 
bleachers alonj; with two teams try- 
ing to "get it up" for only 
themselves. 

Both the basketball and vol- 
leyball programs bring exciting 
action to one of Tort Wayne's greatest 
athletic facilities.

For those of you that have no 
idea what the Gates Sports Center has 
to offer, and by looking at the aver- 
age attendance that would be most of 
you, it is one of the largest and nicest 
gyms in the city, seating 2,700 
people. 

This gym is home to four ath- 
letic teams: the mens and womens 
basketball and volleyball teams. 

These games, as well as the 
facilities, are free to all students and 
offer hours of excitement and pro- 
vide countless memories. 

For those of you who neglect 
my sports pages and neglect any- 
thing associated with positive IPFW 
happenings, let me catch you up to 
speed on our IPFW voile) ball teams. 

The womens team is loaded 
with area talent and the mens team is 
one of the most competitive in the 
GLVC. 

As far as the volleyball teams 
go, both can usually be found in the 
national rankings and the men's team 
is one of the best in the nation. 
(Check page 5 for reference.) 

Seriously folks. lPFW's Sports 
Center offers so much to its students 
that it's assanine people are not tak- 
ing advantage. 

Also, it has an advanced fitness 
center. Fellas, that means weight 
room. Good looking girls hang out in 



the weight room, and, if you're like 
me, that is a good enough reason to 
go and check it out. 

Besides offering beautiful 
women, the room is filled with state- 
of-the-art equipment such as four 
Life Fitness bikes, two Life Fitness 
treadmills. Siairmasiers. Concept II 
rowing machines and Airodyne bikes. 

As if that is not enough to get 
you to go to a FREE facility, it also 
offers a Strength and Conditioning 
room, aerobics and dance classes, 
and child care as well. 

The Sports Center, unlike the 
bookstore, cafeteria, and credit 
union, also do a nice job in catering 
to everyone's schedule. 

They are opened from 6 a.m. 
to 10 p.m. Monday through 
Thursday, 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Friday, 
7 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Saturday, and 12 
noon to 6 p.m. on Sunday. 

Although some people would 
say I need to check out the fitness 
room a little more often, at least I can 
say that 1 have attended each and 
every' basketball and volleyball game 
this year at the Gates. 

I end this column in the 
words of the great sports marketing 
department: Get Excited, Get 
Involved. 



Running with Ruble 



Jordan's gone, but Sprewell is back! 



by Ben Ruble, 
Staff Writer 



The AP is reporting 
that Latrell "Choke My 
Coach" Sprewell is going to 
be traded to the New York 
Knicks. 

Most of us know Latrell 
Sprewell as the man who 
attacked and tried to choke 
Golden State Warriors 
coach P.J. Carlesimo during 
a practice last season. 

Spreweil was suspend- 



ed by the NBA for the final 
68 games of last season. 

Sprewell's suspension 
is now up and, supposedly, 
the Knicks are going to 
trade John Starks and Chris 
Mills for Mr. Sprewell once 
the lockout officially ends. 

According to reports, 
the lockout will officially 
end this week so that pre- 
season games can begin 
next week. Then the teams 
will ink the deal. 

The Knicks will soon 
have this trouhled player. 



Manj- NBA players includ- 
ing Patrick Evving and 
Charles Barkley are known 
to be "fiery." But fiery is 
totally different from 
volatile, and Sprewell is 
volatile. 

Sprewell, whether pro- 
voked or not, assaulted his 
coach. Who wants that atti- 
tude on their team? 

If the Knicks want to 
deal with a volatile player 
like Sprewell, let them. I 
am just glad that the Pacers 
lost the race to win 



Sprewell. 

The Pacers, along with 
the Miami Heat, were 
"finalists" for the Sprewell 
trade. That bad attitude 
can stay out of Indiana, 
except when the Knicks 



1 do have a word of 
advice for Spike Lee when 
he watches the Knicks at 
Madison Square Garden, 
"Watch out who you give 
the choke sign to!"
