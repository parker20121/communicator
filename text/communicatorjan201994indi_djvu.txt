January 20, I &lt;)')4

News Editor 

Residents of California woke up 
at 4:31a.m. Pacific Standard Tunc 
last Monday morning facing a 
major earthquake that registered 
6.6 on (he Richlcr Scale lasting 
between 30-45 seconds. 

President Clinton immediately 
declared the area eligible for disas- 
ter relief. Mayor Riordan Reardon 
declared Los Angeles a state of 
emergency. 

Governor Pete Wilson said he 
was thankful the quake happened at 
4:30 in the morning and on a holi- 
day or Los Angeles would have 
faced more destruction. 

Considering that eight million 
people live in Greater Los Angeles, 
only 33 deaths occurred and 274 
people were reported injured in the 
disaster at press time. All ninety 
hospitals in the area treated quake 
victims. 

Firefighters were busy battling 
fires as gasoline lines ruptured, set- 
ting on fire cars that were parked 
along city streets. 

During Monday's quake, 35 after- 
shocks were reported. Several resi- 
dents described the aftershocks 
similar to swaying and rumbling 

James Lee White, Director of the 
Federal Emergency Management 



Agency, activated four emergency 
medical teams to travel to the area. 

FEMA officials sent medical 
relief before local officials request- 
ed assistance. The agency will 
request funding from Congress. 

Property damage estimates have 
not been determined at the Lime of 
press. 

Seismologists say this was not the 
"big one" and do not expect anoth- 
er big quake for several years. They 
expect after-shocks for the new few 
months. Scientists reported 30 
aftershocks registering 3.3 or 
greater. 

Jack A. Sunderman, associate 
professor of Gcosciences explained 
there arc three main faults, a bip- 
stip, a strike slip and a thrust fault. 

Monday's quake was considered 
a thrust fault. 

"A thrust fault moves up and 
over, part of the earth's crust is 
moved up on lop of another," said 
Sunderman. 

"It's upper plate was moving 
northward," added Sunderman. 
The epicenter was just west of the 
Los Angeles basin. 

Dcnisc Sibinski or the American 
Red Cross informed The 
Communicator that local Red Cross 
officials have been placed on alert 
status to travel to the area to help 
the relief efforts. 




Weather 

Advisement 

Update 



In the event the campus 
)% is closed due to adverse 
weather, announcements 
will be made on College 
Cable Access Channel 6, on other local television and 
radio stations, and on a recorded message at 481-6050. 
When possible, decisions about closings will be made by 
3 p.m. for evening classes and 6.30 a.m. for daytime 
classes. Individuals on campus will be asked to leave and 
to remove their vehicles so parking lots may be cleared. 
(If no announcement is made, you may assume the cam- 
pus is open.) 



Because IPFW serves 
a large region, weather 
conditions in different 
areas may not be the 
same as those at the 
campus. Ultimately, it 
is the student's 
responsibility to deter- 
mine the potential 
risks involved if there 
are hazardous driving 
conditions. 



University Resources Policy Committee 
approves parking fee proposal 



by Rumona Mcgown 
Editor in chief 

The University Resources 
Policy Commitiee has approved a 
new Parking Fee Proposal. 

The proposal would eliminate B 
parking and retain A parking for 
faculty and staff. 

There would also be a mandatory 
charge per credit hour for every 
student on campus based upon the 
number of credit hours in which 
he or she is enrolled. 

One of the reasons stated for 
approving this new fee lies in the 
fact IPFW is reaching its capacity 
for the number of cars versus 
parking. 

As for the faculty, if they chose 
not to purchase an "A" permit, 
then they could park in the "B" 
area for free. 

"Through this proposal, there 
will be a considerably increased 
amount of time that security offi- 
,cers will have to patrol the parking 
areas, instead of the constant tick- 
et writing that often occurs," said 
Walter Branson, vice chancellor 
for financial affairs. 

According to the Dec. 3 minutes 
of the committee, Beverly 
Stewart, office supervisor for Arts 
and Sciences, asked Branson "if 
student government was in favor 
of this proposal." 

"Branson replied," the minutes 
continued, "that overall, they 
seemed 10 be in favor of it 
although they did register some 
concern over faculry/slaff parking 
free." 




Will Increased student parking fees alleviate parking problem on campus? Photo by De; 



Indiana Purdue Student 

Government Association wrote a 
resolution stating their opposition 
to the parking fee proposal. 

In the resolution student govern- 
ment stressed that the proposal 
would discourage students from 
carpooling and using other types 
of transportation to gel to the cam- 
pus. Those students will be 
charged per credit enrolled 
whether they drive to school or 
not. 

"I feel the proposal is very unfair 
to students and puts an undue bur- 



den on them. If faculty does not 
wish to purchase the "A" permit, 
then they can purchase a "B" per- 
mit or park in the free lot located 
behind the athletic center," said 
Mark King, senator for IPSGA. 

Linda Woolton, chair of the 
committee and instructor for 
English and linguistics, claims 
that the resolution was not con- 
structed by the IPSGA until after 
the committee had already passed 
the proposal.

Opposition to Administration Parking Fee Proposal 

Whereas, A forthcoming plan for restructured fees on campus will include significant changes in the cam- 
pus parking fee structure, and 

Whereas, these changes will eliminate the current ten(10) dollar per year parking fee for students with 
"B" permits, and 

Whereas, under the plan, "B" parking would be eliminated and all non "A" lots on campus would become 
free parking, and 

Whereas, students, under the proposed plan, would be forced to pay onc(t) dollar per credit hour to park 
on campus, whether they park on campus, or not. 

Whereas, this fee will increase the financial burden on the students of IPFW. raising parking fees, for the 
average studeni(80) percent, during the first year alone, and 

Whereas.while students will pay an average of eighleen(18) dollars per year for "free" parking in the non- 
reserved lols while factuality members who choose not to purchase an "A" parking permit will be able to 
use the "free" lots for free, and 

Whereas, later years of the proposal call for student fees to reach one dollar and fifty-five cents (SI .55) 
per credit hour by the 1998-99 school year, and 

Whereas, students will be discouraged from carpooling and other alternative means of transportation to 
campus, because they will be paying for parking whether they use it or not, and 

Whereas, this may even cause increased parking problems, and cosls, later on down the line. 

Be it resolved, that the Indiana Purdue Student Government Association opposes the current administra- 
tion proposal for restructuring parking fees on the IPFW campus, and 

Be it further resolved, that the 1PGSA will oppose this plan at alt levels in the process of its review or 
implementation unless the concerns of the student body are appropriately addressed and resolved. 



seniative for the committee citing 
a conflict of interest between her 
position on the committee and her 
work at the office of The 
Communicator, was present at the 
Dec. 3 committee meeting and 
served as a student representative 
for IPSGA. 

At (he committee meeting on 
Dec. 3 Stocks said she did not 
support students buying an A 
sticker or faculty being able to 
park in the B parking lot for free. 

"At the committee meeting I did 
gel a chance to voice my concerns 
and I also recorded those concerns 
in my personal noles. Although 
when I received a copy of the min- 
utes my comments were not 
included in the notes and I did not 
understand why," stated Stocks. 

IPSGA senator Chris Douse 
expressed his discontent with the 
handling of the resolution. 

"I was disturbed to read in the E- 
ni. ul messages that Slocks shared 
with IPSGA thai the proposal had 
been passed even though we 
passed the resolution against it." 
said Douse. 

Branson said the proposal still 
has to be approved by the Board 
of Trustees. 

"I believe ibe proposal has three 
main benefits: visible security 
force, the cumulation of the cum- 
bersome task of recording and fil- 
ing all the "B" permit tickets, and 
improved parking for those visit- 
ing the campus," said Branson. 



ASTRO's new 'broaden focus' rises above 
the bad weather and lower attendance 




by Linda Oliver 
Chief Reporter 

In spite of the blistering weather. 
60 participants helped make the All 
Students' Reentry and Orientation 
Program on January 6 a success. 

Originally the 'A' in ASTRO 
stood for "Adult'. Changing their 
focus to 'All' students may have 
been the contributing factor thai 
brought amazing results from 
ASTRO's Orientation Program. 

Linda Johnson, coordinator of the 
center for reluming adults, was 
pleased to hear (he positive reports 
from faculty members and students 
about the program. 

Gregory L. Anderson, develop- 
mental skills specialist of transi- 
tional studies, was also impressed 
by Ihe turn ouL 

Anderson also served as the mas- 
ter of ceremonies. 

"I was amazed thai the students 



stayed for the whole program!" said 
Anderson. 

Anderson felt the Sludent Panel 
was a nice change in the Program 
formal. 

The Sludent Panel transfer repre- 
sentative IPFW senior Gretchen S. 
Haupen felt ihe 
question and 
answer session 
was in ten; sting. 

In response to 
one of Ihe ques- 
tion, " What did 
you find good; 
and bad about 
IPFW?" Haupert 
said, "I feel 

transfer students don't know they 
have the option 10 transfer." 

Haupert feels transferees have ihe 
luxury of having choices of classes 
or instructors because they're new 
to the school and lack background 
information. 




Frank Borelli. vice-chancellor of 
student affairs, gave the opening 
remarks of ihe ceremony.

sisted of: College from A to Z, pre-

LaMasler felt the program went 
so well lhat the siudenls didn't 
seem lo want to leave, but lefl sur- 
prisingly aware that the university 
was concern and caring. 

During LaMaster's workshop be 
motivated and reassured the stu- 
dents. He mentioned thai loo often 
math anxiety occurs because fears 
of the subject are too magnified. 

"Students should have ihe rhino 
aitilude, charge towards the goal," 
said LaMasier. 

LaMaster stated sludents should 
not keep their anxiely in, but should 
share ii and overcome negative past 
experiences with math. 

The Center for Women and 
Reluming Adults has supplies to 
help students in the area of math, a 
quaneerly newsieiter Rapport, and

Opinion 



The Communicator 



Thursday, lanuary 20, 1994 



STAFF EDITORIAL 




Do students need yet 
another raise in fees? 

Just when it seems that 
the administration can't 
possibly come up with 
yet another way to raise 
fees for students, the 
nightmare becomes a 
reality. 

The new Parking Fee 
Proposal is designed 
with the intent of 
improving the parking 
situation on campus and 
to help eliminate those 
tickets that are currendy 
being distributed. 

How is the administra- 
tion helping those stu- 
dents who do not drive to school and do not have an 
automobile? Those students will be charged for 
something that either they do not possess or cannot 
utilize. 

. Furthermore, why is it that the staff is able to have 
the choice in buying a parking ticket? Faculty 
would also have the luxury of choosing not to pur- 
chase an A sticker and therefore, could park in the 
student parking lots for free. 

Again, HOW IS THIS BENEFICIAL TO THE 
STUDENTS? 

It appears that this proposal benefits the faculty a 
great deal more than the students it supposedly is 
intended for. 

Is it our imagination or is this a commuter campus 
and not Ball State or Indiana University? Most of 
our students do not live on campus and have to trav- 
el from the surrounding counties. If students choose 
to carpool, then again they are being penalized for it. 
It seems ironic that when the administration needs 
to readjust it's budget, they find a way somehow. 

Of course, most students are only struggling 
through school anyway. Surely students have the 
money to support yet another brilliant proposal that 
was solely produced to "benefit students." 

It is a fact that the university has more than one 
million dollars committed to the solving the air qual- 
ity problems in CM. 

We are sure that the highly intelligent budget com- 
mittee could up with a way to delegate some of this

Comment of the week: 

"The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exer-

Letters to the editor 

Student gives opinion on "political correctness" 



To the Editor: 

Whai is "political correctness"? 
Once upon a lime. I searched back 
issues of The Fori Wayne 
Newspapers for an answer. 

The News-Sentinel supplied some 
creative examples of what is, or is 
not, "PC." Syndicated columnist 
Joan Beck, lamenting the tarnished 
image of Christopher Columbus, 
described him as "a dead, while. 
European male, politically incorrect 
on a score of counts." in an issue of 
the paper last year. This past 
November, News-Sentinel editorial 
page editor Leo Morris claimed in 
one his commentaries that competi- 
tion is an "old-fashioned," terribly 
politically incorrect concept," and a 
staff editorial announced, "It's offi- 
cial: Your family can proceed wiih 
its traditional Thanksgiving Day 
observance free from politically 
correct guilt. "Family Values" are 
in again. The president says so." 

The Journal-Gazette's syndicated 
columnists provided a diverse array 
of "PC" indicators. Religion writer 
Terry Martingly referred to "politi- 



cally correct" programs on subjects 
ranging from the environment to 
sex" in one article. In another, he 
reviewed a novel by David Aikman, 
Time magazine's senior foreign 
correspondent in which a post Civil 
War-II "socialist," politically cor- 
rect "People's Movement," takes 
control of most U.S. cities, "ironi- 
cally with the support of a fascist 
Russian regime." 

Right wing pundit Cal Thomas 
recently blubbered, "When anyone 
makes a slur or perceived slander of 
any group or individual on the 
politically correct list of protected 
species, they are roundly 
denounced in editorials and by 
spokespersons for the offended 
class until they forced to repent in 
public." 

Thomas has also suggested, 
"America's best Christmas present 
to itself would be courageous lead- 
ers who are noL.. intimidated by the 
censors of political correctness." 

Some weeks ago. centrist pundit 
Richard Cohen deposited this 
nugget of insight* "The term "polit- 
ical correctness" is much abused, 



but in the (Ed) Rollins case we have 
an unmistakable example of it It's 
not clear if be is being attacked for 
what he admittedly did or for boast- 
ing about it." Cohen abused the 
term again in a later column, in 
which he decided that "Any char- 
acter who's "tired of living, but 
scared of dying" may not be 
politically correct but he's instantly 
recognizable." 

The most intriguing "PC" exam- 
ple I found in my scan of the local 
dailies came from a News-Sentinel 
news article with this quote from 
North Carolina radio evangelist 
Joseph Chambers: "Barney (the 
purple, singing dinosaur) is very 
much politically correct and liberal 
in its agenda." 

Taking into account its various 
applications in the local papers, I've 
unearthed the following (by not 
means comprehensive) media defi- 
nition of "political correctness": ' 
"PC" is an alive, non-Caucasian, 
non-European, non-male, anti-com- 
petitive, censorious, liberal, social- 
ist, not-tired-of-living-but-unafraid- 
of-dying, protected purple singing 



dinosaur species that controls 
denunciatory spokesminions con- 
versant in topics ranging form the 
environment lo sex. This conspiring 
correctosaur may be friendly 
toward foreign fascists if our coun- 
try ever has another civil war. 

The properties of this dinosaur 
arc, of course, subject to change by 
order of the President of the United 
States; for example, it used lo make 
Americans feel guilty about 
Thanksgiving Day observances, bui 
the President's recent embrace of 
family values altered the cosmic 
continuum or something, releasing 
the monster's purple grip from our 
national turkey, stuffing and cran- 
berry sauce. 

Additional properties may also be 
granted to this slippery saurian, as 
the need arises, by Time magazine 
senior foreign correspondents, 
North Carolina radio evangelists, 
nationally syndicated columnists, 
and Leo Morris.

Student addresses motorcycle parking 



Letter to the editor: 

On Thursday, Jan, 13. 1 received a 
parking ticket from IPFW's Men in 
blue for parking my Grand Am in 
thai nifty little spot by the Gates 
arena reserved for motorcycles. I 
believe the high temperature for 
that day was about 27 degrees, and 
nary a vehicle rwas to be found on 
the streets of Fort Wayne that day. 

Yes. campus police were well 
within their right lo ticket my vehi- 
cle, costing me the customary ten 
dollars (Heck, I probably could 
have spent that ten-spot on some- 



thing frivolous, like baby food for 
my son). But let us consider the dif- 
ference between the letter and the 
spirit of the law. 

The letter of the law says "Park a 
car in the cycle spot and receive a 
ticket-do not pass go, do not collect 
200 dollars!" 

The spirit of the law, however, 
says that "Yes, a cyclist needs a 
special spot to park their beloved 
hog where it will be safe from 
harm; but when the temperature is 
27 degrees and lower, such a spot 
would be lo no avail, for they 
would have to ride their cycle right 



into their first class, since they 
would be frozen solid to their 
leather seal and would have to ihaw 
a while in order to get off iheir 
bike!" 
If you're inclined to believe in the 
process of natural selection, then 
you'd know that people who ride 
their bogs with a forward speed 
wind-chill of 75 below were killed 
off long ago by hypothermia before 
they could produce any sub-zero 
motorcycle-riding offspring. Those 
that could survive this ordeal are 
probably so lough thai they could 
conveniently lift my car and move 



it from (he motorcycle spot with 
one band while pummeling my 
Ponliac into some Neo-modemisl 
metal sculpture with their num- 
chucks in the other hand-chewing 
off my steel belted radials with their 
bare teeth for a snack. In other 
words, maybe that "Motorcycles 
only" spot should be contingent 
upon weather conditions? Well, 
enjoy my ten dollars. You'll proba- 
bly use it to buy a life-size poster of 
your personal hero-Barney Fife.

A Voice from Generation X? 

Straighten that wrist, soldier 



by Edward Granzella Jr. 
StafT Columnist 

President Clinton was quickly 
smacked into the real world when 
be tried to make good on his cam- 
paign promise to end the ban on 
homosexuals in the military. Not 
only was he opposed by the 
Pentagon and republicans, lead by 
Indiana's own senator Dan Coats, 
but he had a hard time convincing 
members of his own party. 
Eventually he compromised to a 
"Don't ask, don't tell" policy, 
which as far as I know has yet to be 
adopted and probably won't be 
since it's still unacceptable to the 
military and, now, to gays as well. 

"Sixty Minutes." the TV news 
show, aired a story about a 



European military which enlists 
homosexuals. They reported that no 
problems have surfaced. In fact the 
gays have performed in an exem- 
plary fashion perhaps due to over- 
compensation for expectations of 
inadequacy. The only change (o 
procedure was to make the about 
face command optional within 
twenty meters of a shower area. 

Recall that blacks were once seg- 
regated in the military. They per- 
formed equally as well as the other 
units. Over time people were 
allowed to enter the military with- 
out regard to race. Perhaps the same 
can be done with regard to sexual 
orientaiioQ. 

The new unit could be dubbed 
with a colorful name in true mili- 
tary fashion, like the Fighting 



Queens or Pink Brigade. The mili- 
tary brass would probably use this 
group in special circumstances like 
hostile beach landings or to cut 
paths through mine fields. They 
would be sent in first in the hopes 
that a major portion of the enemy's 
munitions might be wasted prior to 
sending in the real troops. 

Why would gays even want to 
join an organization with such a 
deep-seeded hatred directed at 
them? I know, it's principle, duty to 
country, job opportunity, or some 
other trite reason. But being gay is 
an easy out for an opportunity to be 
senselessly killed in some exotic 
locale. Hell, send those straight 
boys over there to get killed to pre- 
serve the way of life of the people 
(including gays) back home. 



Actually, it's surprising that back 
during the sixties draft when every 
coward migrated (o Canada they 
just didn't give the army recruiter a 
big kiss and tell bow much they 
liked a man in uniform. Problem 
solved. 

In order for a homosexual person 
to join the military, they must lie - 
they must deny their homosexuali- 
ty. Once in, if discovered they will 
be publicly bumiliated and immedi- 
ately discharged - dishonorably, I 
assume. This appears to be a prime 
situation for a security breach. 
Someone in that situation might do 
just about anything to keep the truth 
hidden. That may be the strongest 
argument to end the ban on gays in 

the military

Commentary 

Where's the action? 



by Ramona Mcgown 
Edilor in chief 

Last Friday community leaders, 
professors, and students gathered 
together lo hear Claybome Carson 
give a lecture on the Civil Rights 
Movement. I left the lecture feeling 
a sense of hopelessness. 

Yet again, a bunch of bourgeoise 
persons gathered lo talk about a lot 
of rhetoric and not action. We all 
know what Martin and those 
involved in the Civil Rights 
Movement spoke of, now when are 
we going to do something with 
what he accomplished for us. Don't 
you think we have done enough 
begging? 

We as African -Americans know 
dial our laundry is dirty. When in 
the hell are we going to wash it? 
When are we going to discuss ratio- 
nal and practical solutions for our 
problems? African-Americans are 
in a stale of crisis and something 
needs to be done NOW!! 

As a young African-American 
woman, it really hurts me to see 
leaders of my community pretend 
nothing is wrong and continue with 



everyday life with their heads in the 
sand. 

I really believe that if young 
African -Americans saw those pro- 
fessionals in our community trying 
to do something with our dilapidat- 
ed neighborhoods, they would feel 
inspired to also tike action as well. 

African-Americans stood together 
during the Civil Rights Movement 
and together struggled to accom- 
plish a goal. Why can't 1994 be the 
year when again we as a communi- 
ty stand together and take action. 

During the Civil Rights 
Movement people lost their lives 
for the right to vote and attend uni- 
versities. In 1994 most African- 
American males are not Tilling up 
the dorms of American universities, 
yet they are filling up the cells and 
prisons that arc located within this 
nation. 

How bad do things have to 
become for our community to wake 
up and take action? Have we as a 
community become so shallow thai 
we are satisfied with just eating 
and drinking with white 
Americans? Is this how far we have 
come?

Aunt Louise advises 
students on how to fish 




time for a man and two jobs along 

wilh school? 

Sincerely, 
Confused 

Dear Confused, 

It sounds as you are a very busy 
person, sweetheart. 

Now, if the needs thai you arc 
talking about are sexual, we need 
to sit down and taJk. 

It's obvious that you would like 
to have some type of a quality 
commitment with some man. So, 
either you cut back on your jobs 
or find someone al work. I'm sure 
there are men there. But, you have 
lo realize that by dating someone 
on your job can cause problems. 
People at work would also gossip 
about you two. So, I would sug- 
gest that you don't date al work. 

What you need to do is find a 
man or keep the one that you may 
already have and make time for 
him. 

- Sugar. I know working may be 
something that you need to do, but 
your jobs can't always fill your 
life with happiness. So, 1 suggest 
you take some lime out and spend 
it with that special man in your 
life, if you have one. 

I do think you need to stop and 
really decide if you want to be 
lonely or with someone when 
Valentine's Day rolls around next 
month. 

Your loving Aunt Louise 



Dear Aunt Louise, 

I have a problem. There is this 
guy that I have seen around cam- 
pus for the longest time. It's like I 
have a crush on him. Now, he is 
in one of my classes. I don't know 
what to do. We have both looked 



at each other making that ever 
important eye contact for that one 
moment in time. I have this feel- 
ing that he may like me. 

The problem is that he may have 
a girlfriend. I wouldn't want to 
break them up if he does. 
However, I do think thai if he is 
attracted to me, maybe it is time 
for him to move onto someone 
else. 

1 would really like to spend 
Valentine's day with someone 
special. What should I do? 

Sincerely, 
Sleepless In Fort Wayne 

Dear Sleepless in Fort Wayne, 

Honey, you need to realize that 
he may or may not be in a rela- 
tionship. The only way to find oul 
the truth about that situation is to 
have someone ask him or you do 
it direcdy. If there is a way for 
you to find out if he is single 
without him knowing, I would go 
ahead and do it. The sooner you 
know, the sooner you know which 
way to act. 

Now, if be isn't single, you need 
to back off until he is single. 
However, if you do find out that 
be is single, I would meet bim as 
quick as possible. If you have 
friends that know him, meet him 
through them. You need to make 
yourself known. You know how 
to do it 

It's like fishing. The first thing 
you need to do is use good bait. 
Dress up, make yourself pretty for 
him, and give him the 'look.' 
Honey, thai will lure him into 
your area. 

The second step is to hook him. 
Flirt. Bat those eyes. Smile (By no 
means lead him own). 

Once you hook him, the only 
other thing to do is reel him in. If 
you did steps one through two 
correctly, you won't have a prob- 
lem with reeling in that pickerel. 

I wish you all the luck. If this 
one has been netted by someone 
other fisherwoman, keep on cast- 
ing. There are more fish in the 
sea. 

Your loving Aunt Louise

Academics 

Students need to take advantage of courses 



by Linda Oliver 
Cbler Reporter 

There is a common question many 
students ask as they toil through the 
courses they dread or are having a 
hard time understanding: 

"Are all these courses necessary 
for my degree?' 

According to David C. Brennan, 
director of Student Academic 
Counseling Services (SACS), they 




"It is if you want to broaden your 
knowledge for fulfilling your life," 
Brennan said, 

"SACS is geared towards students 
who are: non-degree, undecided, 
transferring from other colleges 
(SAC is a quick open for late trans- 
fers), and those who must take 
preparatory courses to enter a 
degree section when transferring 
degrees." 

Brennan feels many freshmen tack 
academic maturity because they 



don't know their 'comfort level' 
when choosing their total semester 
credit hours. 

"Many students don't take care of 
themselves." Brennan said with 
concern. "Many (freshmen) start 
with 12 or more credit hours in 
their beginning freshman year not 
realizing that their grade point aver- 
age will most likely be lower." 

He also stated that some freshmen 
do not register early enough lo get 
the best class opportunities. 



So. the next time students are 
tempted lo complain about the 
required courses for their degree, 
ibey need to think about the fact 
that their broadening their life skills 
and chances of gelling a better job 
in the future. 

Wouldn't a company be more 
inclined to hire someone who has a 
variety of classes in his or her back- 
ground? 

Think aboul it. docs il make 
sense?

The Communicator 



«B/ You didn,t 

*/^y hear it 
from me, but.. 




By F. Lane Dnust 
Feature Editor 

Well, you didn't bear it from 
mc, but the Communicator bas a 
new editor in chief. Her name is 
Ramona Mcgown. Let mc tell you 
folks, Miss Mcgown don't play. 

Yeah, I stepped down to relieve 
some of the stress. Anyway, I'm 
keeping my fingers cross because 
I hope to gel out or ibis gracious 
town by the summer. 

It's not that I hate Fort Wayne 
or IPFW. But, Fort Wayne has a 
way of destroying a person's spir- 
it. It traps you hear. And IPFW 
bas a way of dragging out a stu- 
dent's education. No one has ten 
years to spend trying to get a 
degree. 

Most people I know like 
mysclfiust want to get in and get 
out as soon as possible. But, I 
would also like lo leave tbc uni- 
versity atmosphere with some 
type ofknowledgc. If eel we are 



trained all throughout high school 
to just graduate from bigb school, 
go to college, and graduate with a 
degree that makes you 
bigbucks.but without really gain- 
in gany knowledge. 

Isn't that the point of going to 
school to get an education? 

Ob, welt, life goes on, but I 
would like to enjoy a litdc 
bit of life, yaknow? 

Anyway, I think il would be nice 
if the university would inform us 
of when school is closed because 
of adverse weather? 

Maybe, it's just me but I love 
attending school when it's IS 
below zero, don't you? 

And before I leave, let's take a 
moment of silence for the earth- 
quake in Los Angelos. Hopefully, 
ibings will be up and running 
pretty soon ! 

Well, I just wanted to share 
these little thoughts with you this 
week, until next week — you 
didn't hear il from mc.

School of fine and performing art heads for New York 



By F. Lane Douse 
Features Editor 

For the first time in the history of 
IPFW, tbe School of Fine and 
Performing Arts is taking a trip to 
New York City this March. 

According John Morris, assistant 
to the dean, tbc trip is for anyone 
interested in going to tbe Big 
Apple. 

"So, far the people who are going 
range from teenagers to senior citi- 
zens," Morris said. "It will be an 
interesting group that will bave a 
chance to get to know each other." 

Several professors on campus will 
be attending tbe trip. 

Larry L. Life, acting cbair and 
associate professor of the theatre 
department, expressed his excite- 
ment about the trip. 

"The most positive thing about 
this (rip is that ail fine and perform- 
ing arts students will get to see 
great models," said Life. 

Life feels it is important for stu- 
dents to see these types of people 
due to the limited exposure of pro- 
fessionals in the arts in Fort Wayne. 

Music Department chair John E. 
Taylor echoed ihc same enthusiasm 
as Life concerning the trip. 

"I think it is a wonderful opportu- 
nity for students, faculty, and mem- 



bers of the community," Taylor 
said. "Il will be an opportunity for 
culture exposure for a whole week 
and tbe price is right." 

The package for the trip includes 
all expenses (not including food, 
carfare within the city, shopping or 
sightseeing). Participants will be 
staying at the Edison Hotel wbicb is 
in the heart of New York's theatre 
district. 

Prices range from $780 (four in a 
room), $875 (triple). $950 (double), 
and $1085 (single). 

The activities planned for the 
New York trip are split into three 
subgroups: music, theatre, and an. 

Participants in tbe theatre sub- 
group will bave a chance to see an 
On and Off-Broadway play, semi- 
nar at a costume shop. Lincoln 
Center tour, and a workshop in the- 
atre careers. 

Life has chosen Kiss of the Spider 
Woman and Angels in America as 
tbe shows he would like (0 see 
while in New York. 

"I chose these shows because tbey 
arc the two of the biggest, had the 
most publicity, and are on tbe cutting 
edge of new theatre." added Life. 

Tbe music subgroup will observe 
a New York Philharmonic 
rehearsal, music career workshop, 
seminar at a recording studio, 



Lincoln Center and Radio City 
Music Hall tour. 

According to Morris, the Visual 
Arts subgroup will go to the 
Metropolitan, Mona, and wither the 
Guggenheim or Whitney Collection 
Museums. 

The trip is not limited to fine and 
performing arts students. 

"We'd like to fill up the trip," said 
Morris. "There is a scholarship 
available for fine arts, music, and 
theatre students to help offset tbc 
cost for students who want to 



attend." 

Students are interested in tbc 
scholarship should contact Morris 
at 481-6025 or Gerald Lee Railiff, 
dean of the school of fine and per- 
forming arts, at 48 1-6977. 

"Students interested need to make 
their deposit by Friday." Morris 
said. "The remainder is due 
February 4th." 

Students sfill interested have until 
tomorrow. For more information on 
the trip or to fill out a registration 
form, please contact Morris.

Men's Basketball 

Men's team splits games 



Tanisha- 



"In light of ihete simple obser- 
vations, how can the NCAA possi- 
bly consider the reduction of 
men's scholarships as a plausible 
means of cutting costs?" 

In 1991 Uic NCAA voied to lower 
men's basketball scholarships from 
15 to 13 to cm costs while they left 
women's scholarships ai 15. 

Last week ihc Black Coaches 
Association announced a possible 
boycott due to an NCAA refusal to 
reinstate a 14th scholarship for 
men's basketball. 

Inspilc of ihc underlying currents 
of racism and sexism, die heart of 
this issue is a question of fairness. 

When addressing the issue of 
race, many if not most African 
American males rely upon athletic 
scholarships as a way to higher 
education. As any basketball fan 
would notice, basketball is largely 
populated with athletically gifted 
African American males who make 
the game exciting; therefore, draw- 
ing attention to the sport 

The number of young black 
males and other young men of all 
ethnic backgrounds who dream of 
attending school and of playing a 
collegiate sports arc in lite millions. 
The scholarships available are only 
in (he hundreds at best. 

In light of these simple observa- 
tions, how can the NCAA possibly 
consider Ihc reduction of men's 
scholarships as a plausible means 
of cutting cosLs? 

This is not to say that women's 
athletics arc any less important. 
While women's athletics are 
noticeably less publicized, the fact 
remains (hat men's athletics pro- 
vide universities with millions of 
dollars annually. Understandably, 
tbey have a right to expect equal if 
not belter trcatmenL 

Until (he NCAA is willing (o put 
stronger emphasis upon women's 
athletics, thereby providing them 
with a way of earning money for 
universities to create funding for 
women's athletic scholarships, 
they cannot and should not expect 
men's athletics to be responsible 
making up the slack.
