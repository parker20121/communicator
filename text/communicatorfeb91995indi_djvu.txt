IPSGA court to review referendum 



By Nol T. Bcckley 
News VMtoT 

rPSGA Presidcni Mark King offi- 
cially requested ihai the judicial 
branch invesligalc the legality of the 
lechnology fee referenduin. 

King asked for the investigation 
in response to Keny Adkins" peiiiion 
challenging the constitutionality of 
the referendum. 

King called on newly appointed 
Chief Juslice Matt VanRyn to 
promptly examine Uie referendum in 
regard to Adkins' petition. 

Attending the meeting were 
members of SAD and the IPSGA 
Senate. Adkins was not present at 



the meeting. 

"We wanted the referendum on 
the IIPFW Board of] Trustees agen- 
da for their February meeting, 
which. ..is nol going to end up hap- 
pening anyway," declared Jerry 
Richardson, IPSGA director of com- 
munications, 

Richardson said he believes that 
since no one can find fault with the 
technology fee they have to question 
the methods. 

"[Opponents] say that we tried to 
force one decision over another upon 
the students," said Richardson. 

Richardson said the IPSGA 
mailed two documents to every stu- 
dent, voting was held over four days 



in the four buildings with the most 
student traffic and they had contact- 
ed the local and campus media with 
material concerning the lechnology 
fee referendum. 

IPSGA Senator Cecil Baker ques- 
tioned whether the information was 
misleading to students about when 
Internet would be implemented. 

The target date for the implemen- 
tation of Iniemet "could be" Spring 
semester of 1996, according to 
IPSGA flyers. 

Baker said, "Many students have 
told me they were under the impres- 
sion that Internet would be installed 
this semester." Baker said he heard 
that originally the administration 



Financial aid 
office conies 
under fire 



ByNalT.BEcklcy 
News Editor 

Wall Branson, vice chancellor of 
finiuicial of fairs, denied public access to 
a document wliich evaluated the perfor- 
mance of Ibe IPFW Office of 
Scbolonhips and Financial Aid. 

Reports from n confidential source 
said Ibnl the report addressed student 
diu a lis taction with the lack of interper- 
sonal communications skills of the staff 
in the Financial aid office. The report 
also addressed concerns with (he 
Ddminisiration and its job performance. 

"I guess. 1 don't want to comment 
on that." said Branson. He indicated 
that the person to speak with would be 
Frank Borelli. vice chancellor of stu- 
dent affairs. Borelli was unavailable for 
comment. 

The report was investigated and 
written by Joyce Hall, director of finan- 
cial aid at Purdue Univccsity-West 
Lafayette. 

Branson, in an official reply said, 
"State statute eitempis from public dis- 
clMUie documents 'that are expressions 
of opinion or arc of a speculative 
nature, and that ore communicated for 
the purpose of decision making.' " 

"We're not trying to bide anything 

V.C would do this no matter what the 



report Slid," added Branson. 

"If I was the director of IPFW's 
fmancial aid office. I would tell ... what 
was in the report," said Hall. 

"We wanted |Hall) here because of 
her background in financial affairs ... I 
was not involved with the decision to 
tiring her to campus; the person who did

Kathleen Edwards, manager of the 
Freedom of Infonnation Commission at 
University of Missouri, said the ciCalion 
falls under discretionary disclosure. 
They can give it out without breaking 
the law. but they can also withhold it 
without breaking the law. she said. 

Hall emphasiicd that bringing in an 
outside consultant should not tie consid- 
ered negative. 

Branson said Uiai the univer5.i\ J&gt;t.

was not going lo allow the referen- 
dum to take place. He expressed 

concern about the students knowing 
everything about Internet. 

"We wanted to get the students 
informed as soon as possible. ..their 
inability to read is not our problem." 
responded Richardson: 

"I wanted the students to know 
that the administration had called to 
stop the vote and then they called 
back and said 'start it'," said Baker. 
Richardson added he feels the stu- 
dents who voted are the ones who 
cared about the referendum and 
those who did not vote were neutral. 

Mike Heit, IPSGA vice-president 
of finance, was the official ballot 



counter." I declared the ballot 
approved and there were no ballots 
thrown out." said Heit. 

Although there is nothing in the 
current IPSGA constitution concern- 
ing referendums, the next constitu- 
tion will have a secuon on referen- 
dums, said Heit. "It was an oversight 
on our part and we will remedy that 
in the next constitution," Heit 
declared. 

Student Activities Director Greg 
Callen applauded all of IPSGA for 
their actions this term. Callen said he 
doubted whether or not the IPSGA 
ever receives positive reactions and 
said he felt it should, 

Callen said, "The administration 



is very pleased with you...Ihey have 
coinmented on the quality of student 
leaders this year." He said the 
administration was gratified with the 
ability of IPSGA members to con- 
cern themselves with the issues and 
have been efficient in their dealings. 

"IIPFW student government] has 
not been diis way in the past." said 
Callen." This is probably one of the 
best group of students that we've 
had to work with," 

Hcil said the parking fee will 
increa.sc to S22 next semester he also 
said this year's budget hearings will 
be more streamlined than last year 
and will only lake one day. 



not usually disclose any document that 
would fall wjihin the discretionary 
guidelines. According to Brandon, Ibe 
content of the report docs not affect his 
decisions on whether documenis can be 
released pubhcly. 

"When I make a decision on the 
rcleaiie of public information... I cannot 
look at the nature of the material ... only 
bow it fits with the nature of the crite- 
ria." stated Brandon. 

Bringing in another source to evalu- 
ate departments occur; frequently 
among affdiatcd universities, according 
to Branson. 

"It shouldn't be perceived as nega- 
tive. If you have an operation you want 
someone lo review ii from a different 
perspective and who knows other simi- 
lar operations or has a wide variety of 
experience. No matter wbai the reason, 
you can get it done fairly cheaply, espe- 
cially within the system," said Branson 

The statute in question is chapter 
three, section four, number six, state 
and local statute concerning access to 
public records. 

The fmancial aid office has frustrat- 
ed several students recently. Several 
students bave complained of general 
disorder inside the IPIW financial aid 
office.

student contact [while writing the 
report) as I would have liked." Hall said 
they bave student focus groups at 
Purdue to discuss certain issues con- 
cerning students. 

Sophomore Yvetle Absion said she 
received different instructions from dif- 
ferent people within the financial aid 
deparunent. 

"I've never experienced so much 
confusion and disarray at other 
schools." said Absion, She transferred 
from Kansas State University and also 
attended a local community college 
where she used to live. Absion further 
said that dealing wiih the financial aid 
office was exhausting and was an 



"The whole experience is almost 
enough to make you quit school." said 
Absion. 

Another sophomore who wished lo 
remain anonymous unknowingly 
received an additional check which 
should have covered her tuition. The 
financial office has admitted its mistake 
in this matter. 

The siudcnts fees were marked paid 
by Ihe Bursar's office on Oct. 31. 1994 
for the spring semester. The student was 
notified of the mistake on Feb. 3 and 
was asked to pay the amount of the bill 
immediaiely-51 109. 

'They should have bad me endorse 
Ihe check and give it back lo them for 
my tuition," said the sIudcnL 



"II was not by dcccidul means that I 
accepted the money." added the student. 

Junior Aaron Steele also has bad dif- 
ficulties in his exchanges with the 
financial aid office. Spring semester 
was the first lime Steele had applied for 
financial aid. He said thai he bad no 
counselor while applying for financial 
aid. Steele applied for financial aid by 
himself 

Steele said Ibat he never received 
any notification from the financial aid 
office concerning bis application. 

"I didn't know anything until one 
week after the fee payment deadline." 
said Steele. "I'm not going to go 
through the financial aid office again." 



Closing of Sweet Shoppe confirmed

closed at the end of the semester - Photo by Rachel S. Dettmer, Photo Editor 



By Nol T. Beckley 
News Editor 

IPFW Comptroller Phil Grole 
cli3sed the Sweet Shoppe in Walb 
Union as a cost-saving measure 
effective at Ihe end of the semes- 
ler. 

The decision was reached by a 
group which included Groie and 
Vice Chancellor of Financial 
Affairs. Wall Branson. IPFW 
Chancellor Michael Wanell was 
kept informed of the details con- 
cerning the termination of the 
Sweet Shoppe. according to 
Grote. 

A statement released last week 
by Judy Clinton, executive direc- 
tor of university relations, con- 
firmed Groie's comments. 

All services provided by Ihe 
Sweet Shoppe will still be 
offered, but Grote said nothing 
was definite about where the ser- 



vices will be located. 

"I will make a recommenda- 
tion lo Wall Branson about which 
services will slay at the location 
of Ihe Sweet Shoppe and which 
will be moved," declared Grote. 

Grole said he was unsure 
about the where cinema tickets 
would be sold, but stated SAB 
event tickets would probably be 
sold in the IPSGA offices. Other 
services may be performed by 
Walb Union operations staff. 

Some students have expressed 
chagrin at the closing of the 
Sweet Shoppe, 

"It's unfortunate that another 
student service is being taken 
away from us." said Kevin Eads, 
former IPSGA direaor of exteri- 
or relations. 

Grote emphasized Ibat the 
only service the Sweet Shoppe 
provides which will be eliminat- 
ed is the bulk sale of candy. He 



pointed out thai there are venduig 
machines all over campus. 

"Students are under the 
impression that many services 
will be elimhiaied ... this is not a 
complete ending of all the ser- 
vices provided by the Sweet 
Shoppe." said Grote. 

The person possibly most 
affected by the closing is Georgia 
Perry, account clerk for the Sweet 
Shoppe. Perry has three months 
to find a new position and she 
said (hat she hopes lo remain 
with the university. 

Qosing the Swccl Shoppe was 
not a reflection on Perry's perfor- 
mance, according to Grote. "We 
hope she can find another posi- 
tion at IPFW." 

Perry said she was told she 
would receive a lecommendalion 
by the university for any related 
position.

Republicans should not 
drop aid for teen moms 



When Lyndon D. Johnson insti- 
tulcd the welfare plan in the mid- 
1960s he (lid so wilh ihc hope of 
helping people gci back on their 
feet. Thirty years later wc still 
have poverty. Did he intend to 
support unwed mothers, possibly 
encouraging them to continue hav- 
ing children out of wedlock? 
Probably not, yet under the current 
welfare system, (he only way 
many single parents can support 
their children is through welfare. 
Isn't there a better way? 

The Republicans say yes. In 
their book Contract With America 
Ihcy vow to change the current sit- 
uation wilh the Personal 
Responsibility Act. One of the 
provisions of this act prohibits 
mothers under the age of IS with 
children bom out of wedlock from 
receiving funds. How will this 
help the mothers or the children? 
The Republicans claim that the 
current program gives teenage 
mothers incentives for having 
more kids. By taking away this 
money, the Republicans claim 
teenage ntoihcrs will be forced to 
stand on their own two feet and 
not lean on the government for 
support. 

Wc at The Communicator think 
the Republicans are wrong. 
Teenagers arc still not fully edu- 
cated on the reproductive system 
and how it works. Maybe Ihc 
Republicans should start by edu- 
cating these young women. 



Despite what the Republicans say, 
teenage girls who have kids are 
probably not doing so to receive a 
bigger welfare check. If they did 
not have children in the first place 
they would not need to be on wel- 
fare. 

Cutting these people off com- 
pletely is not the answer. We don't 
know what the answer is. 
Throwing money at these single 
unwed parents has not worked so 
far, therefore the government 
needs to come up with a better 
plan. 

In the Personal Responsibility 
Act the Republicans advocate 
work programs. Why not make 
these same work programs avail- 
able to these unwed teenage moth- 
ers, or belter yet, why not pay 
them to go to school? If they arc 
educated then they should be able 
to get a better job and support 
themselves. 

Giving unwed teenage mothers 
money only creates a vicious 
cycle. They get pregnant and drop 
out of school, then they go on wel- 
fare because they can not support 
themselves, when they run out of 
welfare, the only way Ihcy can get 
more is to have another child. 

The government needs to find a 
way to get them educated, and 
help them get jobs or better yet, to 
educate ihem so they have a belter 
chance of not getting pregnant in 
the first place.

To ihe Editor: 

I don't want anyone lo misun- 
derstand me. I have nothing against 
heterosexuals, bisexuals or homo- 
sexuals. I bave friends who fit all 
three of these "categories." 
Personally, I align myself with the 
heterosexuals. However, this 
doesn't prevent me from getting fed 
up with all the extreme attention 
that seems to surround these

group that is conveniently forgotten 



Letters to the Editor 



Students not represented by IPSGA 



To the studenLs: 

It is with great concern thai I 
am writing to you. Most of you do 
not know me and can only form 
opinions by what is given to you 
through this medium. Thus, in all 
fairness I ask that you read ihi^ 
with an open mind. 

Recently I have become embat- 
tled with some of the officers of 
the IPSGA, namely President 
Mark King and communication 
director Jerry Richardson. This 
battle is over a referendum calling 
for the implementation of a 
"Technology Fee." First, some 
background into the formaiion of 
this fee. 

Last spring President King 
decided to champion a cause that 
would bring the Internet and e- 
mail services to this university for 
student use. This is a good cause. 
The educational benefits of this 
system are unlimited. President 
King went to the senate with a pro- 
posal to negotiate with the univer- 
sity to bring this fruit to bear. His 
proposal Slated that ihe source of 
funding would come from; 1. the 
student government itself, 2. the 
university or 3. you the Students. 
The then senate agreed to let 
President King negotiate with the 
University. 

For the next six months no 
word was bead from President 
King about the negotiations except 
for the fact that something would 
be forthcoming. Then, during an 
IPSGA meeting late in November, 
President King placed before 
IPSGA a referendum calling for a 
"Technology Fee" to be imple- 
mented. Mr. Richardson informed 
members that pamphlets would be 
sent to all students informing them 



of the 'Technology Fee" and the 
times and places for informational 
sessions and voting: ' ' 

These pamphlets were sent out 
the Friday before dead week last 
semester. The informational ses- 
sions were held on the following 
Monday and Tuesday wilh voting 
limes held throughout dead week. 
Almost 8 percent of the student 
population voted in that election, 
with just over 62 percent of voting 
students saying "yes". Now 
President King and the university 
want to lake those results to the 
Purdue Board of Trustees and ask 
them to implement this fee. 

Did President King take the 
proposal back to the student senate 
for their approval? No, he did not. 
He stales that be did not have to 
because he was authorized to 
negotiate with the university. Yet I 
have always thought that if negoti- 
ations are held the final proposal is 
always approved by the parties 
involved. But let us look at the 
fmal proposal. 

This "fee" would allow the uni- 
versity 10 impose a S3 per credit 
hour charge on all students for the 
rest of this university's life. That is 
currendy more than S630,(KX) per 
year. This will be used to expand 
existing computer facilities and to 
bring Ihe Internet and e-mail to the 
students. Yet whai of the universi- 
ty's contribution to this system? 

During the informational ses- 
sions, top university officials stat- 
ed that they only put aside 
S175,000 per year for up-dating 
systems and that they cannot 
afford to implement the proposal 
that President King brought to 
them. According to the 1993 annu- 
al report the university made avail- 



able, there is a difference of S5.3 
million between funding and 
expenditures. That, to me, is a S6 
million profit for the university, 
almost TEN TIMES the amouni 
they say they can not afford. The 
university made more then SI mil- 
Uon in interest. 

These numbers just do not add 
up. To date you students have bor- 
rowed more than S4 million for 
education and living expenses ibis 
year alone. How can I, as your stu- 
dent representative, in good faith 
ask YOU to bear the financial bur- 
den for this proposal. 1 believe that 
this should be the responsibility of 
the university, not the students. 
This is a dangerous precedent that 
we are setting here. What will hap- 
pen the next time the university 
must expand? Will the students 
again bave to bear the financial 
burden? Since I have been at this 
university, tuition has risen 14 per- 
cent and parking 80 percent. I 
believe that a new plan must be 
formed in which the university 
must contribute. 

Thus, I must ask you to help me 
in this,figbt. I know you do care 
about this, yet unless you act then 
you, and all the generations that 
follow, will be forced to bear this 
financial burden. I can be reached 
at the student government office. 
The phone number is 481-6586. 
Please just take five minutes of 
your time to leave a message for 
me there and I promise that I will 
return your call. Together you and 
1 can work with Ihe university to 
hammer out a plan that will be 
beneficial to all. Thank you for 
your lime. 

Kerry M. Adkins 



and must suffer in silence. You see, 
I have a dear and close friend who 
has an incurable disorder (and that 
is a fact!) Personally I don't believe 
s/he (I am going to use this kind of 
notation throughout due to the gen- 
der identity dilenuna these people 
suffer) would wish to be cured. 
S/he is a transsexual, which as s/he 
likes to put it is "kind of like God 
stuck in the wrong soul in the 
wrong body." It's kind of a ying- 
yang problem, and these people can 
not maintain or achieve any balance 
in their present state, and that is 
what s/he wants - balance and 
wholeness. S/he isn't a gay or a les- 
bian. In fact, after surgery s/he 
would be a heterosexual who only 
wants to find that right person, be 
married, and adopt kids. You 
wouldn't even notice the difference 
between her/him and a "normal" 
person after surgery and treatment, 
and that is what s/he wants - to sim- 
ply fade into the woodwork of nor- 
mal society and live a whole jour- 
ney of life as a "regular Joe." 
Sounds like a simple request, 
doesn't it? If it is so simple, explain 
to me why these people suffer so? 
They are not freaks. They are not 
weird. It is a legitimate psychologi- 
cal and biological condition. These 
people often go through a great deal 
of pain and frustraiion as my friend 
does now. Sometimes they have a 
friend or two who is understanding, 
but usually not, and what really 
slinks is that there are no clinics or 
support groups for these individuals 
in this "enlightened" town of 
churthes of so-called "brotherly" 
love. These people get consciously 
forgotten and are purposefully 
swept under the rug. No one really 
understands them or wanLs to deal 
with them usually. They struggle on 
their life path alone trying to obtain 
their rebirth. They call, write and 
research in silence, trying to gain 
access to help. E)oes this sound fair 
or humane to you? Come on, peo- 
ple, help these people on their diffi- 
cult path to be full, whole human 
beings and not mere shadows living 
a false existence. Accept them for 
who they are and treat them like 
human beings!

Homosexually Speaking: 

Friendship and dating difficult to mix 



All too often, relationships can 
ruin friendships. I know this first 
hand. 1 once had a roomniaie who I 
considered my best friend. His 
boyfriend was not happy with his 
living situation and began lo pres- 
sure my friend lo let him move in 
... with us, I opposed this idea. The 
apartmeni we shared was barely 
big enough for the two of us. A 
third person 
would noi fit. 




dom without gelling a piece of ihe 
rent. I reluctantly agreed to iei the 
boyfriend move in, providing Lhat 
he paid a fair share of ihe rent. In 
four months he paid rent once. This 
ultimately ended my friendship 
with this person, who was soon 
after dumped by the mooching 
lover. 

Who comes first? Does ihu 
friend mean more because of the 
pre-existing relationship that the 
two of you had, or the new love 
who could possibly lum out to be 
your soul male and ihe one you 
will spend Ihe rest of your life 
wilh? It is a hard decision for any- 
body to make, and each side can 
make a strong agrumeni. 

A good friend will be with you 
always, through the thick and the 
thicker. They are die ones you go 
to when life is kicking you in the 
face and who come to you when 
their day is painful. Friendships 
like these are filled with uncondi- 
tional love. I am not talking about 
friends who love you to gel things 
from you, I mean the ones who hurt 
when you hurt and who celebrate in 
your happiness. These kinds of 
bonds are rare in the finding and 
long in the making. Lovers will 
come and go. but fnends stick by 
you forever. 

On occasion, true love is discov- 
ered and should be taken seriously. 
It is better to have loved and lost 
than to never have loved at all. I 
can nol name all of ihe people I 
know who have given up on find- 
ing their soul male. For many, love 



is only a word in a song and will 
never be achieved. It is when diis 
love of a lifetime is discovered that 
the argument begins. 

I think there is room for both. If 
someone is lucky enough to find 
boih a real, true friend and a love- 
of-a-lifctime mate, then the two 
will naturally melt together. The 
friend will be supportive of your 
relationship, and Ihe lover will 
embrace your ftiend as a major part 
of you life. When that fails to hap- 
pen, then a piece of your puzzle 
docs not belong. If your friend can- 
not accept your relationship, then 
he is not truly your friend. A friend 
should be able to express his or her 
concern about this new love, but if 
they are truly a friend, they will 
accept whatever decision you 
make. If a lover tries to come 
between you and your friend, bets 
arc that this is not your soul male. 
It is very important that the people 
who you hold dear to yoi), get 
along. 

Another strain a relationship can 
have on a friendship is when a rela- 
tionship ends and a new one 
begins, all involving the same three 
people. I have been both the victim 
and the beneficiary of this scenario. 
I have daied people who had better 
chemistry with my friends and I am 
now dating someone who previous- 
ly dated my best friend. It is not 
easy from eidier angle. I was hurt 
when I realized lhat 1 could not 
make this person as happy as my 
friend and it huris me to see my 
best fnend have problems dealing 
with my relationship wilh his ex. 

In the earlier incidents, I was 
hurt but supportive of my friend's 
relationship. I truly wanted it to 
work for them, but wondered what 
was wrong with me. With the lat- 
ter, I have so much that 1 want lo 
share with my closest friend about 
my new love, bui who understand- 
ably does not want to hear it. So 
what do I do? Well, the best advice 
1 can give myself is to acconuno- 
date my friend's wishes and not 
throw things in his face. He, as did 
I, will eventually come around and 
will be happy for us. 

The point is, both friendships 
and relationships are important. It 
is up to you to decide which one 
takes priority. Do not let a less- 
than-true friend come between you 
and a true love, and do not let a 
less-than-true love come between 
you and a true friend. 



Letter misleading because of mistake 



To the editor, 

In the original version of a letter 
I submitted to The Communicator 
concerning it's call for state-man- 
dated religion, I noted that in addi- 
tion to the four names The 
Communicator assigned to God, 
"one could add Krishna, Goddess, 
the Great Spirit, or innumerable 
other understandings of deities or 
spirituality found among animists, 
Buddhists. Partis ... (etc,)," 

In the version altered by The 
Communicator and printed in it's 
Jan. 12 issue, the word "under- 
standings" was changed to "misun- 
derstandings," conveying an insult- 
ing opinion about the beliefs cited 
which this writer did not write, and 
which I do not support. 
Consequently, I coniacied The 
Conununicator's current editor-in- 
chief, S, Brant Kelley, and request- 
ed a correction notice. Kelley 



declined to correct the record, 
therefore il is necessary that I clari- 
fy tiis paper's error for him 

I don't appreciate il when an 
insulting generalization which I 
never made is published with my 
name attached to it Had it been an 
honest mistake, honestly clarified 
by an hooest editor, there would not 
be a problem. 

This is not the first time thai The 
Coirmiunicaior has inserted claims 
in my writings which 1 did nol 
write, nor is it the first time The 
Communicator declined to clarify 
enors for which it is responsible, 
that misrepresent the views of a 
writer who disagreeis with some of 
The Communicator's positions. 

I'd like to hear Kelley's justifi- 
cations for declining to clarify edit- 
ing mistakes when they severely 
misrepresent the views of letter 
writers. Is Kelley indifferent to 



accuracy and clarity? Or, does he 
ilnd il easier for The Communicator 
to misrepresent the arguments of 
those who disagree with the papa's 
editorial positions, than it is for 
Communicator editorial writers to 
construa sound arguments? 

I encourage Kelley to consider 
the following quote from The 
Communicator's Jan. 19 staff edito- 
rial concerning the dissemination of 
false information by media: 
"Sometimes the mistakes are cor- 
rected. Sometimes they are not. 
Sometimes they weren't mistakes; 
diey were lies."

Homosexual column hypocritical 



Dear Ediior: 

I im wriiing in response to ibc col* 
umn lifted "Homiraciually Speaking." 
Before 1 begin, lei me lell you thai I 
am noi homophobic. 

What has forced mc to write ihis is 
ihe hypocrisy ihe aulhor bas dis- 
played. One week he writes aboul 
how ii IS noi right to label a group of 
people and the nexl week he refers lo 
ibe heterosexual community as 
"breedcra." The heterosexual commu- 
niiy bas moved away from referring 
lo homosexuals as '"queers" and 
"fags." Inaicad ihey arc called either 
homosexual or allernaiive lifcslylc. 
Why can't homosexuals refer to ibc 
bcieroscxual coirmiuniiy as heterosex- 



uals or traditional lifestyle? 

The aulhor also writes in a recent 
column about going out with "Mr. 
Wonderful." The auibor commenis 
about sleeping wiib "Mr. Wonderful" 
before he really wants to. It seems 
immoral to sleep with someone before 
marriage whether it is a traditional or 
alternative lifestyle marriage, 

I hope the auibor continues to 
write Ibe column and bring to Ihe stu- 
dent body a different perspective on 
life. 

My wish is thai Ihe author slari 
practicing what be preaches and Tinds 



Other student groups should be represented in newspaper 



Dear editor: 

I am writing in regard to my con- 
cern over fair and equal rcprescnia- 
tion within Ihe primed pages of 
"The Communicaior." Over the lasi 
several issues I keep seeing the ani- 
clc called "Homosexually 
Speaking." Now the anicic itself is 
not my cause for alarm, for this ani- 
cic gives adequate representation to 
the gay communiiy on this campus. 
However, my concern is fof all the 
oihcr groups on this campus such as 
the Black Collegiate Caucus, 
HIspanos Unidos, The Iniernaiional 



Student Oigamzauon and the Greek 
Organizaiions. to name just a few. 
ihai are not receiving this same kind 
of representation within these same 
pages of prim. 

li is my understanding thai every 
year ihc sludcni government gives 
funding to The Communicator for 
the purpose of helping defer the cosi 
of putting forth a paper for the stu- 
dents. The money for ihis funding is 
provided by the student services fee 
that we, as studems on ihis campus, 
all have lo pay. Therefore, is ii noi 
fair to ask "The Communicaior," 



Student government's behavior not appropriate 



To the Editor 

Being a member of student gov- 
emmeni can be a valuable experi- 
ence for ihose who participate, 
many of today's sludenl leaders 
may go on to become tomorrow's 
community, national, or world 
leaders. The experience means 
more than simply "being there. " 
Experience in leadership means 
dealing with issues in a logical and 
mature way. 1 wonder if this pcinl 
is reali«;d by cunent members of 
our Indiana Purdue Student 
Government Association (IPSGA), 
The IPSGA is currcnlly debat- 
ing the referendum on the lechnol- 
ogy fee. What is proposed is an 
upgrade of our campus computer 
system which will allow all IPFW 
! students lo have quicker, easier and 
I more complete access to a large 
I variety of information networks. It 
is my individual opinion that this is 
a good idea. However, I also 
believe that since all IPFW siu- 
dcnis are being askeiJ lo pay for 
this, the IPSGA was wise in asking 
the students opinion on Ihe matter. 
Unfortunately, the collective wis- 
dom of the IPSGA seems to have 
' faded at this point. 

When one member of the 
Student Senate voiced concern 
over the integrity of the referen- 
dum his concerns were rejected, 

Prices too high at 
Follett's bookstore 

Letter to the Editor: 

You may have felt as I did at the 
end of last semester. I was delighted 
that exams were over, yet I was total- 
ly outraged at Ihe monopoly Follei's 
Bookstore has on the textbook mar- 
ket. I sold six textbooks back to 
Follet's and had enough to buy one 
new textbook. 1 guess Follet's can do 
whaievcr Ihey want since Ihey have 
no competition and wc as students 
have NO CHOICE but to go to them 
for new or used books. 

Where is the student government 
that is supposed to be looking out for 
our best interests? My suggestion 
would be to have a student govcm- 
mcot book fair. The students could 
sell their books to other students. 
Since this is probably an issue that is 
taboo thanks to campus politics, wc 
will never have any choice other than 
lo clench our teeth at the end of the 
; spring semester as Follet's does it lo 
usagun. 

Steve Rodkey 



being given little or no considera- 
tion. At this point the issue stopped 
being aboul the technology fee. but 
moved 10 Uie higher issue of prop- 
er governance. Simply stated: It is 
my opinion that any IPSGA mem- 
ber that took part in subduing the 
dissenting opinion, before it had a 
chance to be stated in full and 
completely investigated, has 
attempted to abrogate the democra- 
tic process of government. Each 
member of IPSGA was elected by 
students of this campus. He or she 
is their eyes, ears and voice for 
issues that affect them. To refuse lo 
give due consideration to the opin- 
ion of any member is tantamount 
to refusing Ihe opinions of stu- 
dents. This is unacceptable and I 
call on all true student leaders to 
stand above the personal animosi- 
ties now present and face issues 
dirccUy. 

First, the technology fee should 
not be pursued any further if the 
students truly do noi support it. 
Listen to the dissenting voice, let 
him speak and let his points be 
investigated and debated. When 



this issue, which should never have 
become an issue, is properly pui to 
rest, then perhaps the student lead- 
ers can address some relevant 
issues Ihai I bave heard no talk of 
yet. 

I am concerned with the feasi- 
bility of the proposed project. It is 
claimed that the technology fee 
will cover the expenses, but I fore- 
sec problems which do not involve 
money. As most students who have 
ever taken a computer class or had 
long term papers to compose will 
agree, there are many times during 
the semester when ii is hard to Hnd 
an available computer terminal. 
Wilh this new technology. I 
assume students will be spending a 
lot more time on the computer. 1 
ask all current IPSGA members: 
How can you guarantee that I will 
not have lo forego using the com- 
puter for my lerm papers because 
some computer lechie is busy 
sending e-mail, playing space 
invaders or otherwise roaming the 
computer highway? More compui- 
ets will also not negate the fact 
that, at limes, increased usage

which IS supporied by funding from 
the students, for the students, and 
published by students to provide 
equal representation to all students 
and student groups on this campus, 
and not just to those of the homo- 
sexual orieniaiion? 

I have seen other school newspa- 
pers where a seciion is put aside for 
use by student organizations to tell 
aboul upcoming events such as the 
International Sludcni Organization's 
Seventh Annual Unity of Friendship 
banquet . or to promote guest speak- 
ers that a particular group might 
have invited to campus to give a 
seminar, or even to lell aboul Ihe 
types of activities in which the stu- 
dents on this campus can partici- 
pate, such as Ihe Delta Gamma 
Sorority's Spring Formal, or the 
Inter Greek Councils "Greek Week" 
activities and games. All of these 
arc c«nts that are sponsored by stu- 



dent groups, the same student 
groups whose members all pay a 
student services fee when they pay 
their tuition. The same sludcni ser- 
vices fee thai provides a budget to 
the student govemmeni, who in turn 
applies a portion to The 
Communicaior for funding. 

So again, 1 address my concern 
about equal reprcscniation. Ii is my 
hope that The Communicator can 
address this issue in such a matter 
that it will open up the lines of com- 
munication for all students and stu- 
dent groups on this campus so that 
all can receive fair and equal rcpre- 
scntaiion.

wishes to be represented in The

lo the editor or a guest column.

Downtown Bar: The Fort Wayne 
bar search continues... 



By Paul Tupper 
Fealures Wiittr 

Is ll Downlown, or is il 
Sensations? ( wish ihey would 
decide to call it Sensations. 
Whenever I tell someone that I am 
going Downlown. ihey always ask 
"where downiownT' For whatever 
reason, the bar on the landing 
close to Columbia Sireci West is 
once again named Downtown, ll 
is also this week's victim in my 
weekly search to find the most col- 
legiate bar. 

This is a lough call to make. 
The Downtown that you may 
know and love or hate, is going 
through some major changes. The 
result promises to give Columbia 
Street a run for iLs money for the 
tide of most collegiate bar. 

For starters, the bar is under 
new management. Gary 

Kirkpalrick, an alumnus of IPFW, 
will be overseting the changes that 
lie ahead. By day. Kirkpatrick is 
an account executive for 
WDJBI06,3 and has had a hand ai 
boosting the business of another 
bar, Wrigley Field. 

Kirkpalrick calls Downtown 
Fort Wayne's only true dance club, 
1 disagree, HOTS certainly had the 
music and the atmosphere of a 
dance club and should be added to 
Ibis category. But what HOTS 
docs not have and what Downtown 
will, is viU^ieiy. Downtown, which 
is open for business Wednesday 
through Saturday, will offer a dif- 
ferent atmosphere each night. 



Wednesdays will stay the same 
as it is currenUy and is known as 
alternative dance music night, fea- 
turing a mix of techno and club 
masic. Tlte music is not the only 
thing alternative about Wednesday 
nights. Much of Fort Wayne's 
younger gay conununity is present, 
much to the delight of Kirkpalrick, 
"When 1 come hcre_ on a 
Wednesday night, I feci like I am 
in a club in Chicago, not in Fort 



Wayne" says Kirkpatrick, It is 
very enthusiastic to see heterosex- 
ual and homosexual people go to 
the same bar and dance to the 
same music without cither group 
compromising their integrity or 
rights, 

Thursdays, Downtown will fea- 
ture local musicians playing 
"unplugged", acoustic music, 
Kirkpatrick hopes that this will 
give this city a quiet place to hang 



out as well as a stage for local 
musicians to showcase and perfect 
dieir talents. 

Fridays will continue to be a 
place to dance with music off the 
latest dance chan. This is ainent- 
ly the most popular night to go to 
Downtown. 

Saturdays will begin to feature 
bigger bands. The goal here is to 
get such hands as the Cranberries 
and die Stone Rcses, and any odier 



bands that Ht the college radio for- have a college bar. 



mat. This is a welcome addition t 
the Fort Wayne bar scene. 
Alternative music has always dom- 
in.ited the college scene and is cer- 
tainly needed if we are going to 



It is hard to tell if Downlown 
ranks in the college bar category. 
If Kirkpatrick can pull off what he 
has planned, dien a college bar )l 
shall be.

Domestic exchange offers diversity to IPFW students 



By MelL^sa Young 
Staff Writer 

Venturing out into the world 
beyond die ol' Fori Ls an oppomini- 
ly that many would like to seize. 
There are many programs often 
stashed into tix nooks and crannies 
of the IPFW campus that many may 
not know exist. 

Tbc department of Student 
Affairs a.vsists siudenis who wish to 
study abroad at ihcir own expense. 
According to Dr. Philip Kennel!, 
director of International Services, 
there are only a few sludcnLs who 
actually choose this route. "My 
office only deals wiUi smdenis who 
want to study overseas," Kennel 
said. "There are very few students 
who do this on dieir own." 

Kennell's office however, does 
have an occasional student go on an 
exchange program. "We have an 
exchange with Bngbton University 
in England." Kcnnell said. "We've 
only had a couple of students in the 
past four or five years go." 

However, the department of 
Student Academic Counseling pro- 
vides a national exchange program. 
Associate director Laura Herbrand 
said. "The program has existed over 
25 years and IPFW has participated 
in 20 of those years." 

In order to participate in the 
National Student Exchange (NSE), 
students must be full time students 
and have at least a 2.5 GPA. A 90 
dollar application fee is required. 

According to Herbrand students 
who are accepted to the program 
pay the same as if Oiey wen: study-

ing at borne. Even students' finan- 
cial aid may be used with the 
exception of work siudy programs. 

The program was designed to 
allow students to explore new geo- 
graphic regions and study programs 
and cultures for one or two semes- 
ters. "Many Spanish majors like to 



study in Puerto Rico because they 
arc imerscd into Spanish," 
Herbtand said. 

Although the NSE is open to 
sophomores. Juniors, and senior, 
Herbrand suggests that seniors Fm- 
ish at tbeir home school. 

Currently. IPFW has sent fifteen 



students to seven different states 
and Puerto Rico. It also hosts four 
studenus from other universities. 

Anyone wishing to join the 
exchange next fall must apply by 
February 27 in KeiUerllOE.

University Women: 

Real life trials and tribulations 




By Kara Whiting 
Features Editor 

Sister MarybcLh Manin is a famil- 
iar face lo some of IPFW's siudenis. 
She is a co-ordinator of Campus 
Ministry and is a vital pari of this 
campus' rebgious activities. 

Martin has been involved with 
Campus Ministry since she was a 
siudenl- When she was in college. 
Mariin said thai Campus Ministry 
belpcd her to focus on her Lfe. 

Martin started Campus Ministry 
from the co-ordina tor's point of view 
about six-and-a-balf years ago. 
Martin's first few years were in 
South Bend and then she worked for 
Indiana Tech. Now, Martin is in the 
middle of her third year at IPFW. 

Martin also works with the 
Indiana Institute of Technology 
Campus Ministry in conjunction 
with the IPFW Campus Ministry. 

Martin went into this tine of work 
because she said she wanted to "give 



Sitter Marybeth Marlirt of Camptu Miniitry ■ photo curtesy 
of Sister Martin. 

Israeli musicians to come to PIT February 14 



back what was given to me." 

Campus Ministry does mostly 
volunteer projecu that involve stu- 
dents. Some of the projects include 
everything from e:iam breaks to a 
work/study program trip scheduled 
for this spring. 

Martin focuses on her beliefs and 
faith in the Catholic church. Martin 
works closely with Cheryl Peterson, 
another intcgia] member of Campus 
Ministry. Peterson handles the 
Protestant affairs of the group. 

Campus Ministry reaches out to 
diese Christians and focuses on help- 
ing young adults find their way of 
life. 

"Everything 1 do is connected lo 
faith and growth as human beings, 
helping people find their gifts." This 
is important to Martin who was 
helped herself by Campus Ministry 
when she was in college. 

Martin's plans for the future are 
not clear, but she would like to edge 
her way out of the organization so 



that the students who are involved 
can take over and sec i( from another 
point of view, like she herself has 
done. 

"I sec my role as gelling out of a 
job. I want to see that they [group 
member^! don't need me," remarked 
Martin. 

Manin commented on how she is 
trying to back off more and more to 
let students feel they can take over, 
but that is not her only conccni. 

"I would like to see it (Campus 
Ministryl grow, not just in numbers, 
but also spiritually." Manin said. 

Martin, said she has two great 
accomplishments. First, her greatest 
accomplishment in Campus Ministry 
was die alliance between Catholics 
and Protestants. She said she was 
amazed diat this exisLs, Her greatest 
accomplishment in life is who she 
has become and how she has 
m^urcd. 

"Becoming the person that I am, 
my approach to my life, my faith has 



developed a lot and facing the things 
with in me that I don't like and try- 
ing to work with them," Manin said 
of herself.

Lady 'Dons 
dump UWP 
Rangers 

By S. Brant Kelley 
Edllor-ln-Chlef 

Dy the humble way she talked 
:er ihc game on Thursday 
nighi. no one would ever know 
Wendy Rccker had accomplished 
anything noteworthy, let alone 
broke a record. 

However, Recker. just in ber 
sophomore year, can be proud. 
She shattered the single season 
sisis record in helping the 
[PFW women's basketball team 
win. 79-62. against the 
University of Wisconsin- 
Parkside (UWP) and improve to 
U-7 for the year. 

The Lady 'Dons jumped on 
the Rangers early and cruised to 
their fifth straight win at the 
Gates Center in front of a sparse 
aowd of around 100. 

IPFW coach Pam Bowdcn 
said, "1 think part of the problem 
lai we played too easy of a 
non-conference schedule.. .when 
we got to conference, it's.. .a rude 
awakening for us." 

Rcckcr handed out 13 assists 
to bring her season total to 143, 
passing the previous record of 
137 set by Dawn Harbaugh dur- 
the 1990-91 season. She 
broke the one-game assist record 
of 13 in the Jan. 28 upset of 
Southern Indiana. 

"She is in the lop twelve in 
the nation with assists right 
now.. .the last few games she's 
gotten doubles, so 1 think she's 
just going to keep inching up 
there. Hopefully, she'll gel back 
the top ten," stated Bowden. 
IPFW scored the first ; 
points of the game and us 
lough defense and good passing 
to build a 26-12 lead with si; 
minutes left in the fust half, Thi 
team entered the locker rooms at 
half-lime with a seventeen point 
lead. 39-22. UWP shot 35 per- 
a'nt from the field in the half 

The injury-plagued Rangers, a 
new GLVC member next year, 
hampered by the long trip 
from tlie outskirts of Milwaukee. 
'The other thing that bun us is., -I 
had no idea it was going to be a 
five-hour drive down here," said 
UWP coach Wendy Miller. 

Guard Jenny Kassing con 
curred. "1 think that we're not 
really good jusl pbying as we get 
out of the van for five hours...! 
think that we were just a little 
in the first half We haven't 
had a lot of practice time.. .we 
only have five or six players that 
can practice all the time." 

The Rangers began the second 
half with an 8-4 spun to cut the 
lead to 13. and closed the gap 
again to 11 with nine minutes 
left, but would gel no closer. 

If we'd just played the first 
half like we played the second 
half, we might have given them a 
better ball game." added Miller. 

The Lady 'Dons extended the 
lead again to 19 points with jusl 
over ihree minutes left in the sec- 
ond half to win. 

The Rangers were lead by 
guard Jenny Kassing with 15 
points. Forwards Maci 
Pemsieiner and Amanda Hawn 
contributed 13 points each. Their 
field-goal perceniage improved 
in the second half and they fin- 
ished Ihe game at 47 percent. 

Bowden said, "We did well on 
the boards. There were spuns 1 
ihoughi (defensively) we played 
well and at other time we jusi 
sonof let up," 

Lindy Jones and Jennie 
Newbard led IPFW wilh 16 
points each. Newbard pulled 
down a game-high 9 rebounds as 
the Lady 'Dons oui-boarded 
UWP 47-28, Bowden played 11 
players, eight wiih double-figure 
minutes. 

Bowden said, "Bart Deny did 
a.. -good job tonight offensively. I 
:hould have played Bobbic 
(Thompson) a little bit more." 

Recker commented. "1 
thought it was a good game 
because every one on the team 
got some playing lime and e\«r&gt;- 
body got a chance to work 
together."

Men win in OT; women romp 



ByS. BrBntKellty 
Edilor-in-Chlcf 

The IPFW men's and women's 
basketball teams boiled Ashland 
University on lasi Saturday at the 
Gales Center lo avenge a pair of loss- 
es to the Eagles on Jan. 7 at Kales 
Gymnasium in Ashland. 

The Lady 'Dons started slow, then 
stepped up the intensity to fly away 
from the Lady Eagles. 98-76 for Ibcir 
fifth win in a row and a GLVC mark 
of 5-5, 

Ashland used balanced scoring to 
jump out to early leads of 11-6 and 
23-17 before IPFW took control mid- 
way through the first half. Forward 
Jennie Ncwhard scored 10 points dur- 
ing the first seven minutes lo keep the 
Lady 'Dons m rcacli, 

IPFW played evenly wilh Ihe Lady 
Eagles for the next four minulcs, then 
went on a 12-2 icar wilh seven min- 
utes to go to lead 39-32 wilh four 
minutes remaining in Ihc half Guard 
Lindy Jones scored six points in that 
span. 

The two teams played evenly for 
Ihe rc3i of the half and Ihe Lady 
'f)ons entered the lockers wilh a 47- 
40 halftimc lead, Newhard scored 24 
points in the firai half. Said IPFW 
coBch Pam Bowden, "She (Newhard) 
was dcfinilcly on," 

IPFW started the second half with 
a six-poinl run to lead by 13 at the 



1:44 mark. The Lady 'Etons cruised 
for the rest of the half maintaining 
the lead between seven and 13 points 
until the eleven minutes were left in 
the game, when they put the game out 

Bowden, however, said she did not 
breathe easy until only five minutes 
were left in the game. "They're ihc 
kind of team-lhal can come back." 
she said, 

IPFW then scored eight siraighl 
points and Ashland never got closer 
than 12 ihe rest of the way. Leading 
88-74 with a minuie-and-a-halC to 
play, ihe Lady "Dons finished off ihe 
Eagles by scoring 10 of the next 12 

Jones led Ihe way with 29 points 
on ll-for-20 field-goal shooting and

Volleydons struggle 
at Penn State; 
return 1 and 2 



By S. Brant Kelley 
Edilor-ln-Chkr 

The IPFW men's volleyball 
team participated in the Pcnn 
Slale Tournameni ai Stale 
College, Pa. on Feb. 3 and 4. and 
relumed with Iwo losses for their 
cffom. 

In the first match on Feb. 3. 
the Penn St. University (PSU) 
Nillany Lions hosted the 
Volleydons and won the match, 
12-15, 15-13. 15-8. 15-8, to drop 
IPFW's record to 3-3. 

IPFW started strong, taking the 
first game and lead in the M;cond 
until service errors and delcriorat- 
ing passing look their toll. IPFW 
coach Amic Ball said, "I was real 
plea.sed with the first Iwo games." 
Ball added he thought the 
Volleydons let up later during the 
match. "We're serving aggres- 
sively,.. trying to serve short, then 
crving deep after we serve 
.short," Ball said. 

The Volleydons committed 20 
service errors, the majority of 
them coming in the final two 
games. 

The NitLiny Lions recorded a 
41 percent kill percentage, with 
86 kills, and 81 assists for the 
team. Ed Josefoski led the team 
with 24 kills, while teammate 
Kevin Hourican made 13 kills out 
of 19 attempts for a match-high 
63 percent. 

For the match, Mike Ter 
Molcn replaced George lakavoy 
as a middle hiller for IPFW. Said 
Ball, "We're going lo use him as 
liddle hitter," instead of a 
backup setter as was originally 
planned. 

ill commented on PSU's 
effectiveness at the net. 
Defensively, we just couldn't 
slop their offense." 

IPf^V was led by outside hitter 
Craig Collins with 37 kills out of 
57 attempts. Middle hitter Felipe 
Ralal and swing hitter Rjcardo 
Soler added 21 and 16 kills, 
respectively. The Volleydons 
killed 30 percent of its allempis, 
as Collins pounded with a 50 per- 
cent efficiency. 

PSU also dominated defen- 
sively. The Niltany Lions' front 
line accounted for eight solo 
blocks and 35 block assists. The 
Volleydons recorded two solo 




Collins 



blocks and eight block assists. 
Penn State improved to 2-2. 
In their second match of the 
tournameni. the Volleydons 
defeated Juniatta College, 12-15, 
15-11, 15-10. 11-15, 15-8 to 
improve their record to 4-2 and 
salvage a win during the week- 
end. 

Ball said he was not impressed 
with IPFW's 
play against 
JC. "I 

thought we 
digressed." 
he said. 
According 
to Ball, the 
Volleydon; 
Ihoughl JC. 
a Division 
III school 
would be easy competition 
'They dug everything we hit at 
them," Ball said. He added that 
JC did noi serve well, and thai 
factor may have been the differ- 
ence in the match. 

George Mason University 
(GMU) spiked IPFW in the final 
match the Volleydons played, 15- 
11,8-15, 15-1, 15-lonFeb,4. 

IPFW's offense broke down in 
the last two games, registering 
game kill percentages of .086 and 
-.286 in the third and fourth 
games, respectively. 

The Volleydons were success- 
ful on 46 and 51 percent of their 
kills during the first Iwo games, 
respectively. For the match, iheir 
kill percentage was 22 percent. 

Ball slated."The match was 
almost identical lo the Penn State 
match, as in we played very well 
in the first game." He added Ihe 
Volleydons fell apart after the 
first game-^d-a-half. 

The Volleydons were led by 
Collins and Ralai with 19 kills 
each. Middle hitler Mike Ter 
Molen pounded 50 percent of his 
kill altenqils; he recorded 10 kills. 
Collins, coming off a respectable 
performance the night before, 
only hit 14 percent of his 
attempts. 

Ball said, "We were not con- 
sistent with our serving." IPFW 
erred in service 14 times. GMU, a 
member of the Eastern 
Intercollegiate Volleyball 
Association, improved lo 8-0.

IPFW has a 4-3 record, includ- 
ing an undefeated 3-0 MIVA 
mark. The Volleydons defeated 
Thomas More College twice and 
Ibe University of Wisconsin- 
Milwaukee on the last weekend of 
January. 

Volleydons David Wilhoit and 
George lakavoy are second and 
third in the conference in hilling 
percentage with averages of 54 
and 53 percent, respectively.

kills per game, good for third in 
the MIVA. Seller Scott Lauer is

Mountain Pacific Sports 
Association, recorded a 6-21 
record last year, 5-14 in the

the UCLAs and the Stanfords reg- 
ularly." The Lions could be a sig- 
nilicanily improved team Uiis sea- 
son. Said Ball, "They (Loyola) is 
better than Rutgers." 

Ball said two LMU players 
played on his Olympic festival 
learn last summer. 

Rutgers of Newark, N.J. is a 
member of the Easi Iniercotlegiaie 
Volleyball Association (EIVA), 
the same conference defending 
national champion Penn State uni- 
versity belongs to. 

The Raidci^ were undefeated in 
their division of the EIVA last 
year. They have graduaied a large 
part of that team. Ball slated, 
"Rutgers is a team like us; they're 
ical inexperienced."

By S. Brant Kelley 
Editor-in-Chief 

The IPFW men's and women's 
basketball teams travel to the 
University of Indianapolis (Ul) and 
Northern Kentucky University 
(NKU) this week in a foursome of 
GLVC games. 

Tonight, the 'Dons visit

Cenier. 

The Lady 'Dons seek to avenge 
a Jan. 14 loss in the closing min-

scoring defense, allowing only 72 
points per game. 

Lindy Jones of IPFW is ihe 
GLVC's second-leading scorer, al

assists per game with an 8.1 aver- 
age. Melissa Graham of 
Indianapolis is second at 6.1 per 
game. 

Graham and teammate Ann 
Hensley are in ihe top ten of every 
offensive category, except one:
