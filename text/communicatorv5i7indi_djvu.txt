27 resignations misleading 



turned out to be false information. In fact, 
there were nothing more than threats of 
resignations; and even the threats were 
clouded more by emotion than reasons. 
This information came to light Friday, 
Sept. 26, 1973, after the COM- 
MUNICATOR was on the stands. 
The confusion in the Students' 



Governemnt was caused by a resolution 
before the student senate, 7374-D, which 
calls for all presidential appointees and 
Senatorial candidates to submit a written 
resume and apperor personally before the 

firmation by that body. The adminstration 
of President Brock Able is strongly op- 
posed to passage of the resolution. The 
false information about 27 resignations 
came from a high-level official of the Able 
government, who has since admitted he 
acted in haste without the approval of the 
student body president. 

Resolution 7374-D was expected to be 
di.scusW und \oted upon this week. 



Athletic committee votes for 
equal student representation 



The Joint Athletic Committee voted 
unanimously to pass a motion that there 
be equal representation of students and 
faculty on the committee at the first 
meeting, October 2, 1973.

7374-D needs amending 



Resolution 7374-D, which is up for consideration and a vote this week before the 
Student Senate of Indiana-Purdue, has so far done more to create confusion and 
disunity in Students' Government than any other peice of legislation in recent his- 

We tend to favor the spirit of the bill, which would allow the Senate to examine, 
through a written resume and a personal interview, any appointee of the student 
body president, or any candidate seeking a position on the Student Senate. 

The submission of a written resume by candidates to fill vacancies on the 
Student Senate and the subsequent personal appearance of these candidates 
before that body will enable the Senate to make a better decision as to 
qualifications and dedication of each individual. 

However, the same docs not hold true for executive appointments. These people 
are appointed to serve on the various committees and boards of the university 
structure. During the course of the year, the student body president must fill ap- 
proximately 125 or these positions. 

Requiring all these appointees to make personal appearances before the Senate 
likely will produce two unwanted results. First, the Senate will spend much, much 
time interviewing these 125 people, at the expense of that body's other respon- 
libilities, Secondly, the subjection of the appointees to possible Senate grueling 
may cause some people to refuse to be appointed. 

Filling positions in Students' Government is difficult enough without adding 



e obstacles 



effort. 



Perhaps the resolution can be amended to make this distinction between 
appointments. The Senate will still give its 
will not handicap the student body president 

n of 7374-D. and it's passage or defeat by 



Senatorial cand 
consent to these appoir 
in his recruiting effort; 

We would only hope, uui uibumvumivuv* &lt;...t-~, •»»•» „ ,.-— — . B . ~. — * 

the Senate, teaches all persons involved in the Students* Government one of basic 
ingredients of politics ... the art of compromise. 



Road work inconvenience 



The people on this campus need to be commended for putting up with all the in- 
conveniences a growing campus must offer. Resurfacing of the roads has been one 
of these inconveniences which annoys people that come to the campus daily. 

Road conditions on campus were very bad and the resurfacing was a much 
needed improvement. Many persons were angered that the roads were not taken 

It has been pointed out ihai the resurfacing has been delayed for a valid reason. 
With the construction of a new building, construction vehicles must travel back 
and forth over the roads. Thus, the heavy load on the road surface would soon 
damage the road once again. 

The administration could have waited until classes were out for a fewdays, such 
as a weekend or vacation period, to improve the roads. Resurfacing when little 
traffic is expected would be the logical lime. The mass confusion experienced 
during the morning rush hour may have been prevented. 



United Way seeks help 



Camping for underpriM It ti-d children, giving hope to those crippled by birth or 
accident, and supplying services for those who cannot afford them are only a few 
things that the United Way docs for this community. 

All the functions of the United Way program would take an enormous space to 
tell about. One thing is very apparent though, and that is the United Way has done 
and still is doing a lot to better our community. 

The United Way campaign lets those who can afford to give do so. It has even set 
up a program so that a person can give a little each time he gets paid. 

A community of this size needs some thing like this to help out those who need it 
most. As the town grows larger, the problems of the citizens will multiply, n is just 
nice to know that there does exist an organization to fulfill the hopes and as- 
pirations of many. 

If everyone docs 3 small part, as the Jerry Lewis Telethon proved, soon there will 
stand a force so great that nearly all the problems of a city can be anaylized and 
corrected.

lightly. 

Dr. Robert William Baird is a New 
York internist and he has a flourishing 
upper class practice in Manhattan. 

However, he spends several nights a 
week from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. at the Harlem 
office of the Free Clinic of Heroin Ad- 
diction. It must be free, because otherwise 
the addicts would have to rob and steal to 
pay the sliding fees doctors have.

Thus, in his 19th year of this volunteer 
chore, Baird's career is a refreshing story 
of public service. But, everything he has 
found and what he fears for the future is 
most un-refreshing. 

Does he think things are getting better 

he said, calling on testimony he gave 
recently at a hearing of a Senate Judiciary 
subcommittee. 

point. In his testimony he said, "Frankly 
we are losing the battle. In New York City 
we have had close to 1.800 deaths in the 
last year from overdoses of drugs and 
perhaps the worst item of all is the 2,000

methadone. Last year we had 2,000

He says this seemingly harmless trick 
leads to glue sniffing, and on to heroin. 

He urges "the generals and the ad- 
mirals" in the military service to get with it 
and make sure their young medics are 
trained to spot addicts as they enter the 
service. He says that evidence gathered in 
his Harlem work proves to him that drug 



addiction is widespread in the armed 
services and cites specific places where he 
claims it is bad: Ft. Dix, N.J., Ft. Bragg.

Thursday, September 20, the world saw

THE BIG HEIST 

So Wilt Chamberlain has jumped from the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers to the 
San Diego Conquistadors of the rival ABA. Chamberlain, one of the greatest pro 
basketball players ever, but now 37 years old, will serve as player-coach, 

The money this giant will garner is, to this writer, a mind-boggling sum: well 
over one-half million per year for the next three seasons. Even if San Diego now 
becomes a contender and fills their house every night, (he franchise will still be in 
the red for at least ten years, paying off (he astronomical contract of (he aging 
Chamberlain. 

Last year the Stilt made more money lh.ni I Oil,. it In. buddies lie grew up with put 
together. And Chamberlain has never relished (he thought of sharing his wealth 
with a wife and children. 

Most definitely a man's life is his own business as long as it's within the law. 

But what is the law? 

There ar; no price ceilings in any pro sport. The commissioner of a pro league is 
supposed to make every effort to see thai the league and each franchise within it 
operates as profitably as possible. If one franchise collapses it can hurt and even 
cripple the whole league. 

And what about the other players on the San Diego team? How much money 
could possibly be left for them? 

A typical sakiry la Ik will prohahly go like i Ins- Ic.im official: "l Ik ay Ernie, we 
can give you S9800 this year." 

Playen "Did I hear you say $9800?" 1 can't live on that! I could be making 
S20.000 with New York! 1 made 512,000 last year and had a great year!" 

Team official: "Sorry guy, we have the rights to you, not New York." 

Player: "A pay cut? Are you serious?" 

Team official "Well, we can give you 2110 shares oi Will Chamberlain slock at a 
great price."

SLANT ON 
SPORTS 

By VINCE LOCHBIHLER 



Now that the regular baseball season is finally over, the big question in 
everyone's mind has been answered. Hammerin' Hank Aaron couldn't break Babe 
Ruth's all-time mark of 714 homers — at least this year. 

Okay, so you say that Hank will be back next year and will be sure to smash 
number 715. I know he will, but he'll have to pay for the fame and fortune he 
receives. This winter will be the longest one for Aaron, and the pressure will cause 
many sleepless nights. It just won't come easy. 

Another guy who's going to have a lot of pressure coming is the schedule maker. 
It is highly conceivable that Aaron will hit his record-breaking blast before the 
second week of action next year. 

Each individual franchise owner would give "half his kingdom" to have Aaron 
hit number 715 in their stadium. It will be interesting to open the paper one 
morning next April and see that the Braves open the season with a two-week home 

Another interesting point to note as Aaron creeps up on the Babe's record is the 
fact that Hank is using the same model of bat which the Bambino used. Hank is 
using a Hillerich and Bradsbury Company Louisville Slugger model R49. (The 
"R", of course, stands for Ruth.) 

Spalding is now coming out with the A99 bat in commemoration to Aaron's 
feats. It will be almost a replica of the Babe's swatting except for a smaller grip and 
a lighter frame. 

The fan who caught Aaron's 700th round tripper received 700 silver dollars for 
his prized possession. If number 700 was worth that price, can you imagine the 
value of the balls which sail out for 714 and 715? 

Even though I hope Hammerin' Hank hits number 71 5, the Bambino is still my 
choice for the greatest baseball player of all-time. His lifetime batting average,
