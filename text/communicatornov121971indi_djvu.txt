The Indiana Purdue Day Care Cen- 



The newly formed Physically Dis- 
abled Students Organization (PDSO) 
has begun an agretsive membership 
campaign on campus. In order to 
dramatize the obstacles faced by the 
physically disabled, Students' Govern- 
ment President Hark Franke will con- 
duct his entire day's business on Tues- 
day, Nov. 16. while confined to a 




Souder Resigns 

Mark Souder. Co-Chairman or the 
Convocations Committee, has submitted 
his resignation from that position and 
from the committee effective November 
4, 1971. 

In a letter submitted to Student Body 
President Mark Franke, Souder cited 
personal reasons and an "utter frust- 
ration with the Business Office" to 
explain his resignation. 

To fill the vacant seat on the com- 
mittee, Franke has appointed John 
Mann. Serving in the capacity of Stu- 
dents' Government Press Secretary, 
Mann has worked closely with the com- 
mittee by handling its publicity. 

Co-Chairman Sharon Gabet will as- 
sume complete chairmanship of the com- 
mittee until permanent arrangements can 
be made. 

The appointment of John Mann is 
subject to Student Senate confirmation. 



while Franke wheels his heels 
through the halls, members of POSO 
and Circle K fraternity will man a 
table in the cafeteria in order to ex- 
plain the purpose of PDSO and to sign 
up new members. 

At their last meeting, PDSO moved 
to accept the Constitution which was 
prepared by a study committee headed 
by Mike Pfundstein. The Student Sen- 
ate subsequently accepted the organi- 
zation as an approved campus activity. 

PDSO hopc-s to enlist as members 
anyone interested in the problems of 
thephysically disabled, and emphasizes 
that it is not just for those with dis- 
abilities. The organization will serve 
to develop understanding and aware- 
ness of special problems faced by the 
physically disabled, and will sponsor 
social activities of interest to the en- 
tire student body, yet within the cap- 
abilities or the disabled. 

The organization also will serve as 
a united voice to represent needs of 
the physically disabled through appro- 
priate channels. 

Environmentalists 
feature speaker 

The Alpha Chapter of the Izaak 
Walton League has announced that 
Joseph Wright, Environmental Educa- 
tion Consultant for Indiana's Depart- 
ment of Public Instruction, plans to 
visit the I.U.-Purdue Ft. Wayne campus 
next Tuesday. Wright will be avail- 
able for informal discussions with 
interested faculty and students through- 

At 1:30 p.m. in room 107, Mr. Wright 
w;ll discuss the progress and future 
of Environmental Education with mem- 
bers of the Izaak Walton League and 
anv other interested students. 

The |WL also releases plans for a 
week long anti-litter campaign to begin 
on Monday, Nov, IS- The campaign will 
end with a massive campus cleanup on 
Saturday, Nov. 20. 

All campus organizations and indivi- 
duals are asked to lend cooperation and 
support to this effort.

survey to determir 
of day care facilities needed at the 
Fort Wayne Campus. Ail persons from 
the campus who have a need Tor low- 
cost day care services and/or evening 
babysitting services should fill in the 
questionnaire on page 

From the data collected through 
this survey, the committee can proceed 
with the development of a day care 
program designed to serve the specific 
needs of students at the Fort Wayne 
Campus.

It is hoped that facilities may be lo- 
cated on campus or near the campus. 



Qualitative aspects of different pro- 
grams being examined are educational 
services, space needs, state require- 
ments, personnel qualifications, etc. 
Several possibilities for funding the 
program are being scrutinized by com- 
mittee members. 

The survey is a preliminary step 
toward the establishment of day care 
services for the members of the Indi- 
ana-Purdue Campus community.

the committee. They are Marty Martinez,

Wild Horses' 
is film of week 

"Wild Horses oF Fire" will be sho'vn 
hero today as film of the week. 

In 191 I 3 writer from (he Ukraine. 
Mikhail Kolsiubinsky based a novel 
called "Shadows of Forgotten Ances- 
tors" on the life of the Gutsuls, a 
small sect o( people living in the Car- 
pathian Mountains of the Ukraine. 

Shut off from the world by the nat- 
ural boundaries of rivers and mountains 
these fiercely proud and independent 
people clung to their ancient and often 
cruel customs, their devout beliefs 
and a culture interwoven with the 
beauth 
beauty of their surroundings. 

The novel, which became a classic 
of Ukrainian literature, is the basis 
for "Wild Horses or Fire." 

The film will be shown at 4;3fJ,

is free to all activity card holders,

PTC should reduce rales 

Dear Editors 

On Monday Nov. I, the Public 
Transportation Corporation of Fort 
Wayne announced a reduction in student 
fares. What they failed to announce 
was that college students are exempt 
from receiving this benefit. 

It seems they think the college stu- 
dent is not financially in need or this 
lowered rate. They Tail to realize that 
a tremendous amount of college stu- 
dents are living away from home and are 
living on a limited budget. Most of the 
students are financing the fares them 
selves, without parental contribution. 
Upon talking with other students, I 
have found that many are quite angry 
about the decision this company has 
made. Numerous students arc riding the 
bus more than twice a day with a month 
ly total averaging out to be an outrage- 
ous twenty-eight dollars. Upon figuring 
a total for the schoolyear. the sum 
comes to a total of one-hundrcu-fifty 
dollars. 

If Bloomington can manage to allow 
students a charge of twenty dollars a 
semester, surely something can be don', 
here in Fort Wayne to ease a little fin- 
ancial pressure. Therefore, 1 am iniat- 
ing a petition to send to the head of 
P.T.C in an sffort to force them to 
reverse their decision in this matter. 
The petition (on the ledgo outside 
the coatroom) can cither be signed or 
by getting in contact with ma. We 
would greatly appreciate any student 
signing this petition in order to make 
this effort worthwhile. 

Since we are taxpayers in this city, 
our money should be counting for some-

'Fie 1 on campus toddlers 

Dear Editors 

Most people take it for granted 
that human beings mature and grow 
more intelligent as they get older. 
It seems that, with some of our IU- 
PU students, the process is revers- 
ing itself. I'm referring to the sense 
less distributors of litter on our 
campus. Many of the "children" 



have seen fit to deface and clutter 
the grounds and cafeteria with paper 
cups, pop cans, gum and cigarette 
wrappers and an endless bits of gar- 

If this argument is not believed. 
I advise those in doubt to inspect. 
Tor example, some of the playpens" 
in the cafeteria They will see the 
refuse of countless students, who 
are ■ too busy" to pick up their pap- 
er, but not too busy to play cards. 

I say "Fie upon them!" It is 
the duty of every decent member of 
this campus to declare their own 
campaign against litter and then to 
follow that declaration with action 
I advise the toddlers" to grow up 
and gel going!

..Superstar' Last 
week's presentation of the Rock Op- 
era 'Jesus Christ Superstar, ','nads 
thousands of people seriously consid- 
er (his question for perhaps the first 
time in their lives. This is an accomp- 
lishment that Christianity has found 
itself unable or unwilling to do in re- 
cent times. 

Churchfolk have become concerned 
with defending Christ and are neglect- 
ing to obey Him . "Jesus Christ Super 
star" may be an example and a warning 
that the ' good news" does not depend 
on the Christian for communication. 
and that the Christian's mission is a 
privilege from God and not a 
favor to God. 

After all. the Bible says in reference 
to Christ's disciples "...if these 
should hold their peace, the stones 
would immediately cry out." Peniaps 
the ■ rocks" (bands] are crying out the 
message now because the disciples 
have locked themselves up in multi- 
million dollar air-conditioned temples 
full of platitudes and perfume. Perhaps 
it is proof that Christ will be proclaim- 
ed in spite of the Christian if neces- 

The First presentation of Superstar 
was termed sacrilegious by another 
-Titer. My question is, so what? 

The term "sacrilege" is a religious 
'.'mi hi. I religion is of man, not of God. 
In the dictionary, sacrilege" is de 
Fined as profanation of anything con- 
secrated to a deity." To me, it is 
significant that it does not say. "... 
consecrated by a deity." 

The dilference is the diflerence be- 
tween Heaven and Eatth. In fact, this 
Jew. called Jesus of Nazareth, was 
himself accused of sacrilege by the

talists') of his time for healing the 
sick on the Sabbath. 

What, if anything, is the message of 
Superstar' One point is that Jesus was 
a man.... Yes. he was.... 
He was a man capable of being sex- 
ually aroused. Yes. he was. He was a 
man who enjoyed the touch of a wjman. 
Yes. he was. But. He was a man who 
knew the difference between love and 
lust. Yes, he was. He was a man who 
* was in all points tempted like as we 
are. yet without sin." Yes. he was. 
Would that we were. 

We arc so hung op with the Puritan 
Ethic that we cannot consider a wo 
man embracing the Messiah without 
lowering the act to an act of depravity 
and concluding that Jesus could not 
have done so. And yet. we can pic- 
ture Jesus embracing John The Be- 
loved without thoughts of homosexual- 
ity. Why? 

Another point that Superstar makes is 
that Christ was not a part of the sin 
and depravity in which he lived his 
earthly life. 

The most emphatic example of this 
was during King Herod's song which 
was performed in rinky link, roaring 
20's style. During this scene I found 
myself thinking that everything fit but 
the guy playinj Jesus, he shouldn't be 
on stage. Then it struck me this 
was exactly the message oF the gospel 

In all the sensual excitement of the 
number. Christ was so disturbingly 
apparent-subdued yet dominating the 
stage. Out of place in the place but 
not of the place. 

Superstar may be sacrilegious, and it 
may present Jesus as a man. But. it 
does bring us to a consideration of 
Jesus, and it docs force us to answer 
the question. 'Was Jesus just a man'" 

If He was not just a man. and if the 
gospel is real, then Superstar is ac- 
complishing much more for Chris: than 
are the majority of Christians with their 
envy, and bickerings, and defensive

President Franke reflects on Student Directory 



by Mark Franke, 

Student Body President 

As of this past Monday, the 71-72 
Student Directory has been available to 
students. What I hope to do with this 
column this week is to acquaint stu- 
dents with the '-(fori that has been put 
into the Directory. 

Upon assuming office this past Hay, 
I was advised by out-going President 
Scott Gillie not to publish the direct- 
ory because of tremendous costs, both 
ia time and money. In fact, he did not 
include the Directory costs in the 71- 
72 Budget he prepared. 

However, the consensual feeling 
among the people in my administration 
was that the Directory was a service 
of the Students' Government that is 
appreciated and utilized by the Student 
Body. Hence, the decision to publish 
the directory was made. 

The actual publication and distri- 
bution process was assigned to the 



Department. Steve Evans, Sec- 
retary of the Interior, assumed the role 
of general overseer of the project, and 
made nearly all decisions concerning 
the Directory arte- consultation with 
his staff. 

Mike Lester and Brian Quandt were 
assigned ih; roles of co-ordinators of 
the project by Steve and together they 
insured the successful assimilation, 
publication, collation, and distribu- 
tion of the Directory. 

Working closely with the Interior 
people at all times was Dave James, 
Secretary of the Treasury. His first 
task was to compile realistic expendi- 
ture estimates. He obtained three pos- 
sible modes of printing the Directory 
and three corresponding'eost estimates. 

The first proposal was to have print- 
ed and bound by a private outside con- 
cern at a cost of S2.300- The second 
proposal w.is to have it printed by the 
University Copy Center and collated 



Sun. marks end of football 



by Tom Penzone 

This Sunday marks the end of the 
regular season play in intramural flag 
football. If the Posse and the Train 
can pick up wins this weekend, they 
will lioih lead their respective divis- 
ions with undefeated seasons. 

Championship play begins a week 
from Sunday featuring the top two teams 
in each division. The championship 
will be determined by a double elimina- 
tion play-off. 

The championship games will be 
highlighted by the girls teams' yearly 
battle. The gals will be dueling for 
the first and last time this season and 
their game is shaping up as a super 

The young ladies could present a 
display of football expertise which 
would surprise even an optimistic 
Beaver or Nad Tan. 

Predictions regarding the outcome or 
the "Powder Bowl" haven't cropped 
up among the cafeteria keepers as yet. 
However, recalling a few beautiful 



passes that we've seen develop, it is 
apparent that both teams are receiving 
attention from the local Joes, 

Last Sunday's action produced the 
following win and loss columns:

and bound by the Stu'lents' Government 
clerical staff at a cost of 51,100- 

The third proposal was to have it 
printed by the Copy Center and collated 
and bound by student volunteers at a 
cost of S800- This third proposal was 
unanimously favored. 

Upon reaching this decision efforts 
had to be made in three different areas. 
Dave James, with the advice and ap- 
proval of the Student Senate, made the 
necessary budgetary adjustments. 
Vice-President Mike Rothgeb enlisted 
the necessary man-power for the col- 
lation task. Mike Lester and Brian 
Quandt, in co-operation with A.E. ' 
Percifull of the Copy Center, designed 
the Directory and handled the printing. 

Upon completing these tasks, wc 
were left with the collation. The work- 
started at 3:00 in the afternoon this 
past Saturday and it was 9:00 before all 
2,000 copies were collated. Approxi- 
mately 35 people helped with this part 
of the project. 

Again, the afore mentioned people, 
with assistance of Student Senator Dick 
Echert, provided the leadership for 
this phase of the project. 

The on'y task needing completion at 
this time is the distribution. -The dir- 
ectories have been distributed to Act- 
ivity Card holders only. Should there be 
a surplus, the Directories will be avail- 
able to all students. There is no 
charge for them. 

The excellent coordination of Steve 
Evans, Mike Lester. Brian Quandt, 
Dave James, Mike Rothgeb and Dick 
Echert necessitated my personal atten- 
tion on only three occasions. Two of 
these, the decision to undertake the 
project and the choosing of a method 
of printing, were merely m/ assention 
to what in esse-ice was a pre-determin- 
ed decision. The third, or course, was 
helping with the collation. The trust 
I have in these people is well placed.

Our deepest appreciation and admir- 
ation must go to A.E. Percifull and his 
staff in the Copy Center. When mech- 
anical failures and other unforeseen 
problems arose, making it a practical 
impossibility to complete'the printing 
of the Directory by the original dead- 
line A.E. and his staff, worked late 
into the night on three occasions to 
honor a gentlemen's agreement he had 
made with us. 

Such efforts on his part personify 
Iran professionalism.
