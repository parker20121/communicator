Poet charms IPFW with style, humor Lecture to shed light 



By Todd Hamm, News Editor 

Russian poel Yevgeny 

Ycvlushcnko brought his 
uneonvenlionni wil and humor 
lo a near capacity IPFW audi- 

Yevlushcnko, renowned as 
the aurhor o( Ihc iiccl.nimed 
"Babi Y,ir," a dcnunciahnn ol 
Na/j and Russian anti-Semitism: 
read some ol his most recent 
works as well as old favorites. 

"Yeviushenko wrote hL*; first 

Kem a! age Four," said Richard 
msey. chair ol the department 
ol English. By the lime he was a 
young man, he became the 
le.idet ol a new generation of 
Russian writers, he added. 



"His V. 









press ibic," said Ramsey. 
may write aboul eoniroversial 
events, but he's moved to do so 
by love and universal leelings." 
Yeviushenko began the 
year's lifth Omnibus Lecture 
with a sample Irom a recent 

"Snoivllakes v/ere (ailing like 
crumbs ol white bread," he read 
in nearly impeccable English. 
Yeviushenko went on to 
describe a scene Irom his youth 
in which he and a lover came 
across another famous Russbn 
writer, Boris Pasternak, Ihc 
author ol "Dr, Zhivago," 

Yevtushenko's prose chroni- 



cled the meeting which found. 
towards the end, Yeviushenko s 
lover questioning whether he — 
as an old man tike Paslemak— 
would still be as passionate 
about a woman as Paslemak 
was aboul his lover. 

Yeviushenko said that the 
"Russian language gives us more 
possibilities for new rhymes." 

He explained that Ihe stnic- 
lure ol the Russian language 
allows for far more numerous 
variations on the endings of 
words than other languages, 

"When you try lo translate 
Russian rhyme into English, 
however, 11 causes many prob 
lems." Yeviushenko said. 

old-lashioned. Some are not Ioit 
accessible. Some of the best 
English Ira ru la t ions are ollen 
unrhymed. Translations are like 
women.If Ihey arc tasteful. Ihcy 
arc not beaulilul. Bui if they an.' 
beautiful, they are not tasteful. " 

Yeviushenko spent part ol his 
lecture reading his poems m 
Russian. Ramsey and former 
]PFW faculty member Irina 
Korolenko took turns reading 
English translations of the pocm.&gt;i 

Yeviushenko sang some ol 
the poems and strolled through 
the audience, kissing the hands 
of a few women, smiling and 
charming others.

Controversial mural will stay at lU 



lU Chancellor calls 
moving mural 
'morally wrong' 

BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (lU 
News) — Indiana University 
Bloominglon Chancellor Sharon 
Stephens Brehm announced 
Monday her decision lo main- 
lain the controversial Benton 
mural in Ihe lecture room in 
Woodbum Hall. 



because it would, in effect, do 
what Bfnton lefusi'd to do: thai 
is, it would hide Ihe shameful 
aspects ol Indiana's past. 1 might 
note that trying to move Ihe 
mural would probably damage il, 
pcrhaps^desiroy It.- Bur the" major 

of cost or even of preservation." 

She also emphasised the 
importance of diversily on the 
Bloomington campus. "The 
major issue running throughout 
all of Ihe discussions and con- 
these last several 



real issue, the real tesl of char.ie- 
ter, for Indiana University 
Bloominglon is the strength ol 



The 



oted I 



rs.ly" 




Thomas Hart Benton created the 
mural — parts ol which are now 
on display at three sites on the 
Bloominglon campus — for the 
Stale of Indiana exhibit at the 
1933 Chicago World's Fair. lU 
President Herman B Wells saw 
the mural there, remembered il 
and later arranged for il to be 
brought to Bloominglon to be 



the 

Auditorium. Sixteen

tailed

Critics object lo the Benton mural, in lU's Woodbum Hall, 
because of its images of Ku Klux Klan members. 

Brehm said she is "convinced weeks is not, in fact, the Benton 
that moving or covering the mural. 11 is inste.id the status of 



panels ivere pi a 
University Theater and in 
Woodbum Hall. 

The Woodbum mural has 
proven controversial over the 
years because it includes an 
image of robed members of the 
ku Klux Klan burning a cross. It 
also includes an image ol a 
white nurse taking care of a 
black child and a white child. 
Historiarusay the images repre- 
sent Benton's effort to display 
the lull arrav of Indiana history: 
positive ana negative. 

Over the years, some black 
students have objected to the 
KKK image on the mural, say- 
ing it is a racist symbol that 
makes them feel unwelcome 
and creates a hostile learn- 

g environment. 

Brehm praised members ol 
Ihe Black Student Union who 
raised the issue of the mural, 
expressing her "appreciation to 
Ihe leadership and members of 
Ihc Black Student Union who 
have so eloquently expressed 
their concerns in our meetings," 

"If you are an African 
American, you don't know Ihe 
history of the mural, you have 
no context in which to interpret 
it, and you have no choice about 
seeing it — it's quite likely that 
this will be unpleasant and dis- 
comforting,' Brehm said. She 



said that she agreed with the 
students that the existing edu- 
cation program for classes 
meeting in Woodbum 100 had 
not worked well. 

In order lo respond lo the 
students' concerns and lo the 
university's historic commit- 
ment lo diversity, Brehm 
announced a three-point plan. 

First, Ihe educational pro- 
gram informing students who 
use Ihe Woodburn classroom 
about the history and intent of 
the mural will be strengthened, 
so Ihat it is required for all 
groups meeting in Ihe room. 

Second, the chancellor 
atuiounced the creation o( the 
"One for Diversily Fund," lo 
raise private support lor creal- 

on the Bloomington campus — 
art that will celebrate, recognize 
and memorialize Ihe multicul- 
tural past and present of both 
Indiana and Indiana University. 
as well as the importance of 
diversity for education." 

Through this fund estab- 
lished by the lU Foundation, 
the chancellor intends to 

multteuttural artists by commis- 
sioning their work, hiring them 
on our laculty and inviting 
them lo campus for exhibits and 
conferences." 

The Ihird aspect of the pro- 
gram aiuiounced by Brehm is to 
enhance the Bloomington cam- 
pus' commitment to diversity by 
including a section on diversity 
in ail summer orientation plans, 
continuing to provide significant 
funding for strategic luring and 
student retention efforts, and 
calling upon the deans and the 
faculty to integrate diversily 
issues into the curriculum. 

She also indicated that she 
would deliver a "Stale of 
Divetsily" address every year 
early in Ihe fall semester.

Togethcr, they have written a 
book, "Jefferson's Children: The 
Storv of One American Family." 
Their lecture will include a 
slide show presentation thai

Thomas Jefferson/Sally Hemings 
legacy. The Honors Program,

Multicultural Services and the 
Diversity Council arc sponsor- 
Additionally, the Honors 
Program is sponsoring the event 
as part of their twentieth 
anniversary celebration. They 
will also have a showing of the 
movie. "Jefferson in Paris," 
which will be followed by a dis- 
cussion with Chris Patterson,

Student Union. Rooms 114 and 
116 on Tuesday, April 2 at 4 p.m. 
Matthew Kubik, director of 
the Honors Program, said "after 
20 years of honors education, 
we felt that we wanted a series 
ol significant events to com- 
memorate this landmark. This is 
our gift to Ihe IPl^V community." 
Patterson said, "We have 
spent most of our lives being 
mis educated. Throughout histo- 
ry, the debate, over Thomas 
Jefferson and Sally Hemings has 
been whether he raped her or 
theywcrcinlove." 



PaJtei 



Jon said the pairing 
. fall in a gray area. 
1 said th.it from a mod- 



em peirpectinv scholars can 
consider the pairing as slalutory 
rape, considering Hcmings was 
13 at the beginning of the affair. 

Patterson added that since 
jcflcrson owned her, some 
scholars compare the rckillon- 
shlp between the two as sexual 
harassment by a boss in the 
workplace. According to raltciscn, 
it's time to leom Ihc truth. 

The topic of Ihe Uinier and 
Feldman lecture is 'We arc the 
stories we tell," TTie slidcshow 
presentation expands upon Ihc 
book and gives ai ' 



Jefferson/ Hemin^ conlrovcrsy. 

Lanier, a student at Kent Slate 
University and author of Ihc 
book, is touring the country 
because he feels that this story is 
important to America. "We need 
to start a dialogue between fam- 
ilies, races and the world." 

Weiner said this event is his- 
torically significant because of 
the long standing controversy 
over whether or not Jefferson 
had an affair with Hemin^ and 
the exact nature of the alleged 
affair. Two hundred yeats after 
the fact, the truth Is finally 
being proven, 

"It is not just a question of 
correcting the historical record. 
It also will have an Impact on 
race relations and racial idenlity 
in America today," Weiner said. 

The Lanier and Feldman lec- 
ture will slart al 7 p.m. in the 
Classroom Medical Building 
Room 159 on Friday, April S. 
The lecture is free and open to

Opinions 



In a rticnl inler\'icw wilh the band Rusled Rool, il 
was mentioned by the band members that they see 3 uni- 
fication of musical artists in the neac future. 

They believe that the music indoslry has become loo 
segmented and loo fragmented to continue in the manner 
(hat ihey have been operating for the past couple of years. 
That manner being finding a way lo comply to the lasles 
of atj music lans 

This brings up one patlicular question: Can the con- 
federacy of music survive as Ihe industry pushes fotwatd 
in the Iwenty-fjtsI century? 

For years, advertisers have worked as a confederacy 
as Ihcy Iry lo make a person from every age. creed, sexu- 
al orientation and bedlimc habit want to buy their prod- 
uct. RegardlCM of whclher Ihey arc trying lo achieve a 
product look thai will make the viewer want to snow, 
board down Everest or date a supermodel, they are hop- 
ing for one thing .wd that is Ihat you will spend money on 
their product. 

Also, Ihcic appears lo be a confederacy in magazine 

sclecllon, Ijxik down the magazine rack al any booKslore 

and you will see a magazine for any and every kind nf 

person, whether the magazine deals with Ihe person or 

Ihcir interests.

( Sfpf 1 • psoplci musicians in particu- 
, u ic»i.x ^ i^^_ ,g believe that a confeder-

• llClltOria.1 Maybe because of Ihe collapse 



inlernel 
•••••••••• giant Napster, and now the 

horrible remodeling of Morpheus, anotlier file sharing 
program, Ihe music induslry has made it dear that Ihey 
want lo remain a raging bully that docs not want lo look 
aller the music faiu who cater lo the industry's every 
whim. The music industry wants lo con- 

trol Ihe fragmentation of the music. As soon as Ihe fans 
begin lo stand up for what they want and the music they 
want lo hear, nol necessary the music the industry wants 
them lo buy, the industry becomes afraid that they will 
lose control of their fans and more importantly their fans' 
pocket book. 

Confederacies never work, in its early stages of cre- 
ating a government, our counlry was a cor^federacy, and 
it was a failed attempt. Later in thehistory of this country, 
the soulhem slates seceded and formed a confederacy, 
and that failed as well. 

The only reason why everyllung that is available for 
people lo buy Is so fragmented and in a slate of confeder- 
acy is because Ihe industries, nol excluding the music 
induslry, want lo control their market share. 

To lose that control would mean that they would lose 
a lousy three perceni profit margin and Ihey might not be 
able to buy their kids thai yacht Ihey had their nearts set 
on. Meanwhile Ihe kids are dressed in their enecutive 
suils. wailing for Ihe moment Dad dies so Ihcy can take 
over Ihe company, but only after the three perceni profil 
margin is gained. 

1 don I know about you, bul I do not want to be con- 
trolled by people like Ihal. I don't want people like that to 
make the music, and all products Ihal I buy, available. 1 
believe il isfasl approaching hme for consumers to realize 
they musi unite as citizens and take back the things Ihal 



Easter: Historically and 
medically accurate 

The events of Easier were, even though modem-day society 
would like us lo think olherwise, a pivotal turning point of history. 
Two of the bigecst holidays in the United States, Christmas and Easier, 
edsl lor the sole reason iJial Jesus Christ was bom and died. The very 
numbering system we use to couni years have been standardized 
around this man we know as Jcsus. 

But even though fesus has had such an immense effect on society, 
does Ihc Bible accurately recount his final days on Earlh before his erw- 
dfixlon? Do historical Roman dooimcnis and tradilions and even 
modem-day medical knowledge confirm or disprove the death, burial 






ofles 



Prior lo Jesus' arrest, he was prayiric in the Garden of Gelhsemane. 
Luke 22:44 tells us, "And being inaneuisK he prayed more eameslly, 
and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to ihe ground.' 

Sxvcaling blood seems a bil far-fetched, except that today we 
know Ihis condition as hematidrosis. caused by severe aiLXiely,elidts 
the release of chemicals that break down the capillaries in the sweat 
glands, which allows blood-linged sweat lo be released. 

Roman floggings are known to have been horribly brutal, usually 
consisbng of 39 lashes of Ihe whip containing metal balls, leaving 
bruises or conlusior^s and pieces of sharp bone, learing and ripping 
away IJie flesh. 

The spine was often exposed, and the beating covered Ihe entire 
back from Ihc shoulders down lo the back of Ihe legs. In Ihe third cen- 
tury, Ihe historian Eusebius of Caesarea described Ihe floggings by say- 
ing the sufferer's "veins ivere laid bate, and the very muSfes, sinews 
and bowels of Ihe viclim were open lo exposure," 

After such a beating, it wa.s cotrunon for many prisoners lo die of 
hypovolemic shock due lo a loss of blood. The effects of hypovolemic 
shock, as medical evidence points lo loday, are noted in the biblical 
account of Ihe crucifixion. Tne heart races lo try to pump blood Ihal 
isn'l there, then blood pressure drops, causing fainhng or collapse. The 
kidneys slop producing urine, and Listly, Uie person becomes very 
Ihirsly and craves lluiJs lo replace Ihe losl blood. 

His .symnuims of this condilion are evident from MatUiew 2752 
as Icsus could no longer bear the weight ol the crossbeam, and again 
in John 13;28, where Jesus Said, "1 am Ihirsly" 

Traditionally, there has been litllc evidence to suoport the biblical 
account that Jesus was pierced with nails in bolh his nands and feel. 
Most liislorical documents showed Ihal a crucified person's funds and 
feel were lied lo Ihe cross by ropes, which ccmtr&lt;idicis Luke 24:33-39, 
when Jesus asks his disciples, "why are you troubled, and why do 
doubts rise in your minds? Look at my fiands and mv feel. It is I 
myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does nol have flesh and bones, as 
you see [ have." 

This would have been a valid argumcnl. cycept that in 1963, 
archaeologists in Jerusalem found ihc remains of nearly Ihree dozen 
Jews who nad died during Ihe uprising against Komc, circa 70 A,D. 
One victim named Yohanan, was found wilh a seven-inch nail slill 
driven inio his feel, with small pieces of olive wood from the cross 
uprighl slill otlached, 

The argument is often made thai Jesus wasn't really dead on the 
cross, that he had only faked his death to later "resurrect" himself, 

John 19:34 stales. "One of the soldiers pierced Jchis' side with a 
spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water." This is an impor- 
lanlslalemenl lo me, because this confirms thedealh of Jesus, but it 
must be consistent with currenl medical understandings, or else I'd 
have to be a bit doubtful. 

Crudfbdon is a slow and agonizing process of death by asphyxia- 
tion. In order for a person to exhale, he must push up on his feci so ihe 



tension on the diaphragm can be ea^il for a mi'menl and .illow air to 
exit- Upon relaxation, he would ac.iin rcvurr (c .in irjuling position, 
and would have lo ri'fvjt Ihu; I'ninvi u-&gt; btv:ilhi;. ^trjpinghis ali^idv 
raw and bloodied b.ii.-kiin Iho cutm- L:tovi uptij;ht. 

Medical doctors rcll ii^ t^.ii .i- ilx- fvT-on - i-ri-Jitunc would slow, 
he would go into rv?pirdti&gt;r\- ji.i Jom^-. vvbiTo Ihf carbon dioxide in the' 
blood would dL'solve as carbonic aod. causing the blood acidity to 
irKn-Jse, e\ entually leading to an irregular liearlbeat. 

Elefore he died. Ihe hypovolemic shock would have caused a s 
taincd rapid he.irt rate that would contribute lo heart failure, resulting 
inlhecolleclionof fluid in Ihe membrane around the hiNirl. called pen-' 
cardial effusion. 

Thus, when the soldiers thrust Ihe spear into Ihc side, the fluid 
collected in the pericardial sac came out followed by a large volume ot' 
blood, just as John had described. ' 

Some suggest thai the soldiers were wrong or were bribed. bu( il 
is important to remember Ihal the soldiers were professional killers. 
They crucified people for a living, and fully understood Ihat if they 
did not complete the kill, Ihey themselves would be subjected ruttdcss- 
ly lo the same extreme torhire. 

So il's fairly obvious Ihat Ihcbiblical account of the death of Jesus 
is very historically accurate, bul what made a profound inipacl i ' ' 
world was not his death and pLicemenl into the lomb, but (vis re 
linn from the dead. 

We am lold Ihat Jesus arose fwm Ihe dead, al 
human form, on Ihe 
Ihind day, the d.ty

important tonote 

that in scriphires. the 

jews, ivho did not 

believe Jes us tiad 

risen, agn-ed llial the 

tomb ivas indeed 

empty, wilh Ihe body 

nowhere lo be foimd. 

They claimed the disciples must have stolen his body Li!e in Ihe nighl. 

If the dL=dpIes had in fact stolen his body, il is higlUy unlikely 
that nearly every one of Ihcm would later be tortured and killed for 
belicvmg that Jesus was alive. 

If Ihe disciples did nol steal the body, and Ihe Jews likewise 
agreed Ihat Iheoody was indeed gone from the grave, then Ihe biblical 
explanation that God raised Jesus from the dead is the only plausible, 
understandable explanation for the events that transpired on Ihal first 
Easter Sunday morning. 

Besurreclcd. Jesus challenged his disciples lo moke a difference In 
Ihe world, lo hjm Ihe world upside dotvn lor him. His disciples appar- 
ently did a pretty good job, considering our entire yearly numbering 
system evolves around Ihis man. 

You sec, Jesus was God come down lo Earth. His death, as an 
Innoccnl man, ivns a sacrifice for all of us, paying the debl thai each of 
us owes lo God as a sinner, Jesus is voiir sin covering, rcnderingyou 
spotless in Cod's eyes. Ail you must do is ask. 

As hislorlcally and medically accurate as Ihc Easier slory is, you 
cannot get- lo Heaven simply because Jesus died for you. You must 
accepi Ihe personal relalionship Ihal Jesus desires lo have wilh you. 

"Jesus, 1 Ihank Vou fordjingon the cross for my sins 2000^ears 
ago. 1 knmv f am a sinner, and I ask You lo become pad of my life and 
lake away my sins. 1 place my trust in Y'ou, and understand tlial I con- 
nol get lo Heaven any w.iy olher llian through Yuu. and 1 ask Ihat 'You 
will change my life, and clorify Yourself through me. Amen." 

1 hope you'll make the special eiforl this &amp;ister Sunday lo go lo 
churdi, remembering that the Easter sloty is a whole lot more real than 
just a made-up fairy lale. 



Letter to the Editor: 

After reading Nalhan Dichl's last two articles, I fell obligated lo reply. In his March 6 article, he 

claims, "Although you may believe Ihal you area whore, gay or an alcoholic, all hope is nol lost. You can 

slill become a real, genuine person." Wow. 1 didn't Ihink ony young educated person thought this way 

The fad of the matter is, hardly any young people would agree with Nathan Diehl. It they do, Ihey are 

■lainly the minority. 

Diehl claims Ihal HoUyivood and currenl trends are responsible for moral decay. His solution is for 
everyone lo develop a relalionship wilh Jesus Christ. Keep in mind Mr, Diehl, this is your solution. No 
matter what anyone says, I find nothmg wrong wilh the lack of religion in my life. In addition. I have no 
problem with edgy Hollywood films depictmg drug addicts and prostitutes. Il's my choice lo watch 
these movies just like it is Diehl's choice lo profess Chrisliaruty. I'm not going lo force any of my beliefs 
on him, and 1 would expect the same from his end. 

Dichl's March 20 article stales. "If you workhard, you will get ahead in life." Unforhinalely, Ihis is nol 
the case. Many Americans work t^vo jobs and slill live in poverty. In this counlry. Ihe middle class has been 
shrinking for years. The lucrative lax cut by Diehl's beloved George W. Bush is not helping the situation. 

Diehl would have vou believe Ihat hberals in government are ruining this counlry. His claims arc 
absurd for one reason. Liberals are not fairly represented in Washington. Democrats are essentially no 
better than Republicans, It's like havinga choice between conservative and more conservative. Corporate 
and special inleresis, along with big money, are what matter in D,C. When il comes lo corporate media 
and government, tr\ic liberals refuse to buy their way into this corrupt system. It's the sad truth, bul the 
oidy way to gel vour voice heard at the federal level is to have a lot of green backing you. 

1 hope Dien! keeps writing his ullra-conservalive viewpoint in The Communicator for years to 

^ His outlandish remarks fuel the fire for liberalism and logic. In conclusion, I'd like lo end this lel- 

'ilh a uuole. As Nathan Diehl once wrote. "Be real, people. You arc who you are. Be that way every 
da)'." I couldn't agree wilh him more, 

Jacob Schnailman. Sophomore. Undecided

Not quite as yellow-bellied as the fans 
were led lo believe, Jericho relumed shortly

The malch resumed as Triple H landed a 
high knee only lo begin limping, favoring his 
left leg. After tearing his quadriceps muscle 
nearly one year ago, HHH had just relumed to 
ring action this past January. 

I'redalorv instincts laking over. Jericho 
went lo work'on HHH's weakened left leg. 




Taking the action out' 

side the ring, Jericho 
slammed Ihe Game inIo 

Ihe metal ring steps before 

rolling back into the ring. 

Ivlaking it in before Ihe ten count, HHH 

was greetedby an airborne Y2J and dropped lo 

the mat. Jericho saw his opening and applied 

the Figure Four Lcglock on the Game. 

Proving why he is "that damn good." 

HHH reversed Ihe Figure Four and il 

was Jericho's turn to writhe in 

agony. The ref broke the hold when 

Jericho grabbed the bollom rope. 

The action continued at a fast 
and furious pace as Jericho 
attempted a Lionsault. Just in lime, 
Triple H pulled his knees up and 
nailed Y2J in Ihe slomach. Bolh 
men went down for an eighl count, 
but HHH was the first lo recover, 
immediately blasting (ericho wilh 
a facebusler. 

Unable to gel Ihe pin, HHH 
attempted to Pedigree Y2J; howev- 
er, Jericho managed to block Ihe 
move and trapped Triple H in the 
Walls of Jericho. 

Screaming at the ref lo ask for 
submission. Jericho continued to 

slretch HHH's legs and midsecKon, The Game 

managed lo gel to Ihe ropes lo break Ihe hold,

time HHH was able to kick

traded the leF, pre\'enting Ihe

and approached Stephanie, 

intending to take care of unfin- 
ished business when Jericho 

hit Triple H in the back o( the 

head wilh one of his champi- 
onship belts. 

Barely managing to kick 

oul, HHH pulled Jericho into 

Ihe Walls of Jericho, only to 

find that Stephanie had the ref 

tied up again. The referee pre- 
vented a hirious Triple H from 

getting his hands on the Billion 

Dollar IMncesa when Y2J hit a 

low blow and finally got the 

ttuee count. 

Although the match was 

over, the ref still had lo answer tt 

HHH. The Came dragged him back lo the ring 

and Pedigreed him, earning a moral \TCtory, 



The audience didn't miss a beat as chants of "You sNck" 
rang out as soon as Kurt Angle's entrance music cued up. As 
Angle hammed it up in the ring, Rob Van Dam charged through 
the crowd and nailed him after a leapfrog off the ropes. 

Angle, recovered from his shock, gained control o( Ihe 
match early on by trapping RVD in a chin lock. 

Chants of "RVD! RVD!" fueled the competitor ond he pow- 
ered up out of the hold. Defying gravity, liVD pummcled the 
Olympic gold medolisl wilh several moves off the ropes and 
folloived up wilh a series of kicks. 

Perhaps somewhat prematurely, RVD attempted the Five- 
Star Frog Splash; however. Ancle was able to shove Ihe referee 
inIo the comer before RVD could launch himself, knocking him 
from his perch atop the thind lumbuckle and leaving him strad- 
dling the ropes. 

Angle look full advantage o( Ihe situahon and went lo 
apply his ankle lock. Always thinking in Ihe ring, Mr Pay-Per-

They come in a variety of colors, the most popular being caniiel which fol-

The second most popular shoe for 
women: flip-flops. Flip-flops with beads, 
setjuins or buckles are all popular. 
Conveniently enough, color doesn't even 
matter. Stores are showing these shoes in just 
about every color under the sun. Deck shoes, 
white canvas tennis shoes, are popular this 
season for both men and women. Generally 

Wi'dgc- heeled sandals are ^e^ shoes are to be worn without socks, but

This year designers have created quite an unusual spring fashion lire. The traditional pasteb 

normally seen at this time of the year are being replaced ivith the more fall-type colors of broivn and 

beige. The 1970 styles of flared pants and peasant tops are dominating the fashion scene. Designers 

such as Gucci and Armani are exchanging their traditional black 

and white fashions ivith the ne(v Bohemian look. 

Summer weight suede jackets, panis and dresses can be seen in 
just about every store ivindow. While this fabric may look a little 
out of place for the upcoming summer season, designers are taking 
the sveather change into consideration. The summer suedes 
heavy as the winter ones, nor do they have the lining that odj 

material. At the other extremcjjjnotfier popular fabric 
■ the year, it is 
items such as suede jackets or pants. As 
girly as all this sounds, the suedes and linens 
or men's clothing as welt. 

When it comes to pants this season, it's all about cropping. Crop 
pants no»v rule over the capri. What mokes a crop pant different from 
a capri? A crop pant 
comes about an inch 
above the ankle bone 
while the capri pants 
end just below the 




Crop pants domi- 
nate Ihls season 
and create a happy 
medium between 
shorts and pants.
