Peace through love, 
not through strength 



Nuclear war is threatening our very 
cxislcnce. Big brother in Washington 
Iwllcvcs In peace through strength. That 
Is no way to have lasting peace. The only 
way to achieve lasting peace is Ihrou^ 
love and understanding. 

Former President Dwighl D. 
Elsenhower, one-time general of the 
nrmy, said, "People in Ihc long run are 
Roifig (o do more to promote peace than 
our government. One of these days 
gDvcrnmenl had belter get out of their 
way and let them have it." 

This was a career military man 
speaking, not a former actor. Now Is the 
time for the people to send o signal to Uie 
(iovcrnmcnl that we want lasting peace, 
nol a disguised peace through strength. 

Peace through strength will only in- 
ercasc tensions to the point where, one 
day. the Soviet Union will become so 
paranoid loword the U.S. (or vice versa) 
it will commit the first strllie, and we 
will all have hell to pay. 

People favoring a build-up of nuclear 
iveapon^ want us to look at the Soviets 
and (heir activities in Afghanistan and 
Central America, The US. is just as 
Imperiniisllc as the Soviets, but our 



country does it in a more subtle way. We 
have large corporations lobbying In 
Congress for aid to these countries. It's 
these ver&gt;' same corporations that are 
moving plants and factories from places 
in the U.S. lo places in the third world. 
It's these same companies that want 
American service members to protect 
U.S. oil Interests in the m Id-east. 

No, we'll never have a lasting peace 
until the people, you and I lake back the 
power that is righl/ully ours, according 
to the Constitution. Remember the 
preamble: "We (he people of the United 
States, in order to form a more perfect 
union, establish justice, insure domestic 
tranquility, provide for the common 
defense, promote the general welfare, 
and secure the blessings of liberty to 
ourselves and our posterity, do ordain 
and establish this Constitution for the 
United Stales of America." 

The power Is rightfully and legally 
ours. We must seize It from the large 
corporations and elect politicians who 
will serve the interests of the people anit 
promote peace through understanding 
and love.
