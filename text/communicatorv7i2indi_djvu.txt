Psych class necessary evil 

The Students' Government made a good point in being critical of holding classes 
in the Student Union. But it failed to take the most important issue into account: 
[his university is primarily for academic activily and that must be taken care of 
first. 

It is selfish to demand that classes not be held in the Union when a real need 
exists. The (ail is, this campus is hurting for lecture room space. The campus is 
growing and things will get worse before they get better.

span classes are to be held there. He has already indicated that the programs 
scheduled will slay Dial way, and Psych 120 will have to find another meeting place 
for those days. 

Neither administration nor the faculty have anything to complain abmii with 
Lauer's decision Chancellor Schwartz said that he knew of no student activities 
being displaced by the scheduling of classes in the Ballroom. Therefore he must

Holding classes in the Union is not a step toward less recreation on campus, since 
recreation is a rare animal at IPFW anyway. Bui it is necessary that everyone 
here deal with matters in terms of their importance. And it is mosl important to 
have room for the people who need to take classes.
