Reagan makes promises 

Profs discuss effects 



February 12, 1981 



By ELME WOLLMAN 
Start Writer 
Every new presidential ad- 
ministration brings countless promises 
to the American people of a better way 
oflife. 

Being no exception, Ronald Reagan's 
administration promises everything 
from tax reductions and federal 
spending restraints, to government 
regulation changes and an immediate 
surge in U.S. military defense. 

Two IPFW professors discussed 
whether these proposals are possible 
and how the resurgence of Republican 
power will affect them. 

"It's an opportunity for the 
Republican party (o create and solidify 
a majority status in the country," said 
Frank Codispoti, assistant professor of 
political science at IPFW. "But it 's only 
an opportunity, you don't create 
majorities simply by gaining a victory 
in an election." 

Jim Haw, IPFW associate professor 
of history added, "As to it being a long- 
term trend, or a flash -in -the-pan for an 
enduring Republican majority, it's loo 
early to tell " 

Both professors suggested that 
Reagan would have to show the 
American public some major ac- 
complishments before any majority 
changeover could take placr 

As for tax reductions, "It's a very 
real possibility because the ad- 
ministration has put forth the argument 
that reducing taxes will stimulate the 
economy, thus leading to greater tax 
revenues," Codispoti said. 
He also said he feels that tax 



reduction is more than a promise to 
allow people to pay less, that it is a 
fundamental element of the ad- 
ministration's economic program. Haw 
expressed disagreement on that point. 
"There is still some dispute as to what 
the fundamental elements are," he 
said. 

Curbing federal spending presents a 
complex problem for Reagan. "For 
most of the money spent by govern- 
ment, there are those people who 
benefit and who will fight very hard to 
keep that money," Codispoti said. 

"Reagan's going to be taking on 
entrenched, vested interests," said 
Haw, "and that's not going to be easy." 

It's a possibility that the ad- 
ministration would not be able to 
reduce taxes when faced with the 
federal budget deficit. Codispoti.

Senate convenes, 
appoints fee group 



By JIM CHAPMAN 
Chief Reporter 
After two weeks of absenteeism 
among the Student Senators at their 
weekly meetings, a quorum was finally 
obtained for the Student Senate's first 
meeting of 1981 on Feb. 4. 

Since the first two meetings of the 
year were cancelled because of ab- 
senteeism, an amendment was 
proposed byGwhtor Ellen Engieman to 
hold the meeting every other week, 
preferably the first and third weeks of 
every month. Engieman, along with 
some other senators, feel that there is 
not enough business for the Student 
Senate to handle every week and that 
less time for meetings will leave more 
time for committee work. The 
amendment will have to lay over one 
week before a vote will be taken on it. 

Roger Meri weather, Ellen 
Engieman. and Ken Schenk were 
assigned to the temporary Ad Hoe 
Committee to raise the activitv fee (see 
related story' • during the Feb. 4 
meeting. 

Another decision made during the 
meeting was the acceptance of the 
Personal Programers Club into the 
constitution The function of the clubjs 



Fee hike studies, 
increase expected 

By JIM CHAPMAN ~. 



iel Reporter 

A committee has been formed to 
investigate the possibility of raising the 
activity fee for full-time IPFW 
students. 

For thepasi 13 years, IPFW students 
who have taken nine or more credit 
hours have paid a $15 m*Mvity fee per 
semester: the amount of the proposed 
mcreasehasnotyet been determined. 

Inflation and the addition to the 
campus of the new athletic facilities 
i the now-under-conslruction health, 
physical education and recreation 
building) are the main reasons for the 
proposed increase said John Ulmer, 
dean of student services. 

Named to the temporary Ad Hoc 
CommittW to raise the activity fee are 
Students' Government Senators Ellen 
Engieman, Ken Schenk and Roger 
Menweathor, along with Student Body 
President Ann Momper and Vice 
President Sieve Westrick. 

The five Students' Government 
students have already met with Dave 
Skellon, athletic director, and plan to 
search further into findjhg out how 
much, if any, the activity fee should be 
raised. 

When the committee has reached its 
decision on what the increase should be, 
it will pass the decision on to Ulmer, 
who in turn will pass it on to Chancellor 
Joseph P Giusti for his approval. 

After approval by Chancellor Giusti, 
i he proposed increase is sent to Purdue, 
West Lafayette, where final approval is 
given. 

According to Ulmer, the new gym- 
nasium and the economy have taken 
their loll on the present S15 activity fee. 

If one were to add an increase of 
inflation at six percent per year for the 
last 13 years, ihe current activity fee 
Hi.it full timesludenlsshouldpay would 
be S32.G0, which means that the buying 
power of Ihe current S15 has diminished 
by one-half.said Ulmer. 

With the buying power of the $15 at 
hand, money used to buy basic campus 



needs such as lumber for Purdue- 
Indiana Theatre props, supplies for Ihe 
Daycare Center or newsprint for The 
Communicator is hard to come by when 
the Student Senate allocates money 
from the activity fees, said Ulmer 

In 196B, when the present fee amount 
was set, about 6,000 students attended 
IPFW One might think that Ihe in- 
crease from that number to the present 
10,000 students would make up for ihe 
increases in inflation over ihe last 13 
years. 

But according to Ulmer, a great 
number of the increase in students has 
been part-time students who do not pay 
the activity fee. Only full-time students 
with nine or more more hours pay Ihe 
current activity fee. 

According to Ulmer, Ihe fee will not 
be as high as S32.60. "They are not 
going to go that high. Just how high 
the fee should be will be studied," he 
said. 

The second reason for raising Ihe 
activity fee, as mentioned, is Ihe ad- 
dition of the HPER Building to (he 
IPFW campus. Because of Ihe increase- 
in the number of athletic facilities the 
new building will bring, the cosls of 
more athletic equipment, especially for 
intramural sports, will increase. The 
costs of supervision of Ihe intramural 
program, including referees, will also 
increase, Ulmer said. 

Five dollars of the current $15 ac- 
tivity fee Is allotted to the athletic 
department. According to Ulmer, the 
athletic department has barely sur- 
vived on this amount because there are 
not many athletic facilities now on 
campus, especially for ihe intramural 
programs. 

Ulmer mentioned that Purdue 
Calumet raised its activity fee from SIS 
to J26 because it also added a gym- 
nasium to its campus. 

The proposed increase in IPFW 
student activity tees could be decided 
by Ihe Students' Government within the 
next month, the committee said. 



however, said, "If they do not get 
scared, then they will cut taxes because 
thai follows their own theory that they 
will bring In more revenue." 

Changes in government regulations 
and the shift of certain federal func- 
tions back to a state level may bring 
numerous changes. "There will 
definitely be reductions in the amount 
and types of regulations aimed at 
environmental, safely, and business 
communities," Codispoti said. 

This includes environmental 
proteclion, consumer protection, social 
welfare, and aid to cities and slates. 
"Which in turn means less money for 
the cities and states," Codispoti said. 

Haw did not necessarily expect less 
money, and said that Reagan had 
spoken of returning certain functions to 
a stale level together with funding. 

But Codispoti suggested it is not just 
ihe funding (hat counts. "It's the 
philosophy that many slates may just 
not wish to perform certain functions," 
he said, intimating thai the federal 
government would. 

Opposing viewpoints from Haw and 
Codispoti were further sparked by 
Reagan's goal for superior power in 
military defense. 

Haw said he strongly agreed with 
Reagan's foreign defense policy. "We 
are vulnerable or soon will be," said 
Haw. "If our defenses are not 
strengthened soon, then \*e do face a 
loss of strategic equality with the Soviet 
Union " 

Haw further explained how this loss 
could encourage potential adversaries 



lo challenge the U.S. and prevent a 
satisfactory response. 

"But Reagan's views on the value of 
military strength are exaggerated," 
Codispoti said. The political science 
professor feels that Reagan's desire for 
greater nuclear power "will not ac- 
complish the ends that h'e wants for 
more leverage and power in foreign 
policy." 

Both professors agree that a stronger 
military will not solve all U.S. foreign 
problems. 

When speaking on foreign policy, the 
Iranian situation cannot be overlooked. 
Both professors said they feel Reagan 
will probably uphold the U.S.-Iranian 
agreement, but that no one could be 
sure at this point. (Reagan has said 
since, in his first news conference Jan. 
29, that t he intends to uphold the 
agreement.) 

- "Reagan Is kind of caught in a 
paradoxical situation," Codispoti said 
"On the face of it, this offers him a 
golden opportunity lo demonstrate his 
new toughness in foreign policy, but he 
may have lo do things that seem lo 
violale lhat loughness." 

Haw said that Reagan should put his 
diplomats and lawyers to work and 
"find a way of retaliating economically 
without violating the bargain." 

Just as Professors Codispoti and Haw 
differ on Ihe Iranian situation and other 
aspects of the Reagan administration, 
the American people will continue to do 
so with every new administration.

customers. 

On a wooden stool on the slage, gently 
strumminp his guitar, sat tall, bearded, 
Gil Bierman, one of three members of 
Full Sail which formed last June. 

Bierman began his music career in 
1975 al the Blue Mountain Coffee House 
on the Landing. During that lime he 
enrolled part time at IPFW as an 
English major. Currently he is working 
on his master's in English and is an 
assistant instructor in English WlOO. 

He began his college career at 
DePauw University, where he played 
football and studied pre-med After two 
years there he found his capabilities in 
English exceeded those in pre-med, so 
he give up his childhood dream of being 
a doctor. 

For the past two years his music and 
leaching have financially supported 
him. But he considers his music only a 



He has had little formal musical 
training but can play a wide variety of 
musical instruments. Much of his 
musical talent comes from family sing- 
a-longs. He remembers from his 
childhood that the- family would -get 
together and harmonize on old shanty 
songs. 

He took drum lessons and played the 
trombone and other instruments at 
Central Catholic, where he graduated 
in 1972. Bierman said he doesn't play 
the piano, but he has spent many lunch 
hours tinkering on the piano in (he Walb 
Memorial Union. The piano is one in- 
strument he wants to learn to play and 
wishes his parents would have forced 
him to learn. 

With the busy life as a teacher and 
musician he still finds time lo direct a 
choir at Precious Blood Parish, play on

Bierman also loves to travel. He has 
been to Europe twice and is considering 
touring Europe this summer with Full

university in France. 

Sometimes he feels he is living in the 
"19th century along with (Henry) 
James and (Nathaniel) Hawthorne, " 
Bierman said. He rarely reads the 
paper or listens to the radio because 
iviih all. his teaching and studying he 
has little time for those things. 

Even with the success of the past few 
years he does not consider himself a 
famous personality. He enjoys 
audience support but travels unnoticed 
through the IPFW campus. 

After he graduates in July, 27-year- 
old Bierman is n&gt;( sure which direction 
he will go. In the past he has worked in 
journalism, music, leaching, and ad- 
vertising, so he has a wide field to 
choose from. He would like to get 
married and have a family he can sing 
songs (o. Bierman said someday he 
may even write a book, if he can 
produce something as meaningful as 
Hawthorne or James. 



Dancers' pasts lead to discrimination 



Money prompts nude dancing 



By ROBERT RINEARSON 
Slaff Writer 

Half the patrons play pool, shooting 
inside clouds of low hanging smoke. 
The other half sit along the adjoining 
slage and bar. Meanwhile, she dances 
la amplified rock, jazz or new wave, 
clad in only a G-string. She is a' nude 
dancer, commonly known as a stripper. 

As a Iriend and I watched her and 
other dancers at the R-Club, I noticed 
most of ihe women said little. If 
anything, one might smile at a staring 

It was a .couple of days later during 
an interview thai I discovered the 
feelings and thoughts behind that smile. 

As we sat in the kitchen of the R-Club, 
a tinge of nervousness was apparent as 
wc discussed why the women chose 
loplessdancing. 

Not so unexpectedly, all agreed il was 
ihe money. 

Terry Becker, one of the owners of 
the clulj, told me lhat no women danced 




for less than S190 a week. 

One girl, Kendall, age 19, explained 
she had just started dancing 6 months 
ago. Prior lo that she'd worked in 
retail. "This way I'm doing what I like 
lo do. I gel an hour and a half break 
between each 20-minute set. And more 
importantly, it's easy money." 

But while money was the common 
denominator, . their backgrounds 
seemed completely diversified One 
woman claimed she'd started dancing 
illegally when she was 17 at Ihe now 
defunct Fort Wayne night club. The 
Rathskeller. Another said she'd stalled 
when she was 15after she had run away 
to Florida. "It was either that or lay on 
my back," she said, referring to 
prostitution. 

Still another said il was the only job 
she could find. "Its hell oul there 
trying to find a job. A girlfriend en- 
couraged me to try il and I've been 
dancing ever since." 

Becker said the women who danced 
for him averaged between 19 and 27. In 
Fori Wayne a girl can dance topless at 
18, but cannot sit in the bar area for 
leisure. But by their own admissions, it 
was apparent lhat some owners were 
slill willing lo step beyond the legal 
limits (o hireenlertainmenl. 

As we talk, I could hear playing in the 
bar area Bob Dylan's song, "All Along 
the Watchtower." The line "thai life is 
but a Joke," rang In the back of my 
mind as I thought of how I'd heard 
friends malign these women 

"There's a .certain point when you get 
tired of dancing," explained one 
woman named Jessica. "If you don't 
gel out then, you become trapped. Then 
you'll dance 'till nobody wants to watch 
you .inymore." 

I asked Jessica aboul Ihe part drugs 
and booze played in Ihe business. 

"There are a lot of girls who depend 
on them lo get Ihem up for each show. It 
can gel boring," said Jessica. But 
Another woman angucd it was a 



"Are we any different than the 
housewife who keeps Ihe botlle of gin 
hidden in the cuplwiaid, or Ihe valium in 
the drawer? The hypocrites have a lot 
of problems of Iheir own , so why do they 
pick on us?" she asked. 

Recently there was an incident at 
another night club where a man ap- 
parently committed suicide distraught 
over his attraction for one of Ihe dan- 
cers. The women talked about 
problems with the cuslomers. 

"I don't have many problems," 
related Jessica. "Usually the worst 
problems erupt when a couple of drunks 
will starl fighting, or some idiot will 
starf shooting off his mouth with some 
dirty comments. If il gets out of hand I 
let the bouncer handle them ." 

"After hours, the possibilities don't 
bother me, if they did I'd probably live 
in constant paranoia," said a sandy- 
haired girl get ting ready to go on stage. 

If Ihe public sees nude dancing as 
vulgar, mosl of the dancers see Iheir 
occupation as an art. Hours are spent 
perfecting roulines. The older more 
experienced women give tips to 
beginning dancers. 

Becker told me he doesn't want the 
women who work for him lo emphasize 
vulgarity. "A lot of girls who go on the 
road depend on obscenity or total 
nudity. But when that crap takes Ihe 
place of a good routine, you're only 
gonna gel more hassles from' the 
audience " 

Becker also pointed out the dif- 
ferences he's seeing In the crowd which 
watches the dancers. He claims Ihe 
unemploymenl role has caused many 
people to come in full of depression, 
looking fur a place lo forget their 
problems. The clubs and dancers then 
become a mode of ihcrapy. 



There has been a lot of criticism 
about women who dance, with some 
attributing dancing lo a negative resull 
of a male dominated society! Said one 
dancer, "I don't feel threatened by the 
men who watch me. ft was my choice 
and I don't regret It, I Ihink all the 
reactionary groups who think we dance 
due to male pressure feel more 
threatened by men than we do." 

Throughout the conversation, the 
women always spoke emphatically of a 
future life and plans. 

One woman, a veteran of 6 years of 
dancing and a mother of 2, .currently is 
a nursing student al IPFW. Another 
plans lo sign up for the upcoming fall 
semester. With (he soaring costs of 
tuition, dancing seemed a practical 
i way of meeting expenses, 

Jessica spoke of marriage and 
children in her future. Kendall hoped 
for a modeling profession. 

Finding an alternative job often is a 
dilemma, the women said. "We feel 
discrimination when we apply for other 
jobs, Bosses will learn about our past 
and instantly become moral," said one 
dancer. 

After we finished ihe interview, I 
returned to Ihe bar for a beer. 1 wasn'I 
alone as men in :t-picce suits, hard hats, 
loiighairs. husbands sharing a pitcher 
with (heir wives all came together to 
watch the dancer. 

Jessica retired to a corner eating 
from a carton of ice cream and chatted 
idly with a customer. Another of the 
women stood at the pinball machine 
pounding the flippers. 

Meanwhile on stage a dancer named 
Angel swirled round and round like a 
ballerina atop a music box Her long 
blond hair and sheer red gown swirled 
like a kaleidoscope. 1 was amazed how 
her spinning circles seemed (o go on 
forever. 



OPINION 



The Communicator 



ACCORDING TO GU1NESS 



Don't waste 
winter days 

As thp snnw lilmi/% niilsirip the urinrinur * 



I 

( As the snow blows outside the window, 

it's easy to sil back and let the world go 

' by. While it's easier to do this, it may not 



be wiser. 

' Right now, things are being decided 
that will affect your future — things like 
your tuition rate, your activity fee and 
how the incomes from tuition and ac- 
tivity fees are spent. 

The Indiana General Assembly is in 
session, and it is deciding what items to 
include in the slate budget — including 
the amount of money allocated to higher 
education. 

The amount determined by the 
General Assembly will decide how much 
vour college tuition wffl'Be fiicfeased in 
The fail. 



Have you told your stale represen- 
tatives and senators how you want them 
to vote on the proposed state budgets? 

On this campus, the Students' 
Government is proposing an increase in 
the amount paid by each full-time 
student for activity fees beginning with 
the fall term. 

Have you told (he members of 
Students' Governmen! haw you feel 
about the proposed increase? 

Yes, it's easier to sit back and let (he 
world go by — but in the sunshine of a 
crisp fall day, when you're paying the 
higher tuilion rates and increased ac- 
tivity fees, will you regret these wasted 
winter days? 



We asked... 

The Communicator asked students 
, in the lounge in the Helmke Library if 

/ they are in favor of gun control. 

They said... 

"I would say leave the guns to the 
mililary. I hate hunting; I like to live 
with animals ... Guns and violence do 
not help me to live now, but if it comes 
down to survival I would want to know 
how to use one." FJoxanne Wearley, 
fine arts major. 

"G.uiv control should become 
stricter so that anyone with a 
criminal record, especially a felony, 
should not be allowed to own fire 
arms." Burton Hill, accounting 
major. 

"I'm against the idea of gun control 
because hunting is an inalienable 
right. Also, a person sliould be able to 

own a gun for his own self-defense." 

Bill Grimm, math major. 






"It is one of these controls that 
unfortunately is necessary because it 
cgjr, : is,the only means of law enforcement. 
People should be allowed to own 
them. It is important to keep records 
of who owns guns but it is too bad you 
have to invade privacy." Pat 
Schoenrade, psychology major. 





"I am for and against tighter laws. 
There's a need for tighter control but 
it should not affect owning rifles for 
hunting " Stan Tumbleson, com- 



n 



gun control where people are allowed 
to gave guns for security reasons. But 
you shouldn't be able to go in a store 
and buy a gun. Laws should be more 
stringent." Sherie Aikins, nursing 
major. 

ajjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjpiiijj|iijiii^ "A gun should be registered from 

! the time it is manufactured. There is 

^B- 3 no need or reason for weapons for 

personal defense only. Guns should be 

i^ft, M restricted to law enforcement of- 

^^^^- ^^B ficers." Bob Galbreaith, philosophy 

™ ~ major.

WIPU offers 
unique music 



JJj 




Kilty Degler, 

slruinonts at the station in 

Sandra Wiley) 
By GLORIA H1ZER 
Staff Writer 

For the radio listener who 
is unnerved by monotonous 
rock music or bored by bland 
easy listening stations, 
IPFW offers a delightful 
alternative. 

WIPU, 89.1 FM, presents a 
unique style of radio 
broadcasting that includes 
classical music, full length 
symphony concerts, jazz and 
informational programming 
on public affairs. Station 
Manager George Wendt 
stressed that it is the 
diversity and quality of the 
programs that make WIPU 
special. "Most listeners like 
what they hear," he said, 
backed up by the many 
letters of support the station 
receives. 

Some of the programs that 
Wendt is particularly 
pleased to present are 
"Options In Education" 
which covers many current 
topics in the educational 
field, "The Women's Per- 
spective" which focuses on 
areas that are of concern to 
today's women; and "Music 
Of The Black Church." He 
hopes to expand the focus on 
ethnic music and culture and 
spotlight the musical 
heritage of India, Germany, 
Latin America and Greece. 

Discussion programs are 
also broadcast. "Here And 
Now" featuring Louis 
Cantor, associate professor 
of history at IPFW, 
discusses the research 
taking place on the campus 
and how the research can 
affect our daily lives. Also, 



ger of WIPU-FM. adjusts Mi- 
llie Hclmke Library. (Photo by 

contemporary novels and 
popular works are read on 
the air in "Reading Aloud." 
These half hour segments 
are especially helpful to the 
visually handicapped. 

Wendt is concerned with 
presenting high quality 
programming but notes that 
"it is expensive and we need 
the support of the public." 
WIPU is a not-for-profit 
organization, so the listener 
is not barraged with com- 
mercial advertisements. 

"We attempt to solicit 
contributions from the 
business areas of Fort 
Wayne and when we do that, 
it is not called advertising, it 
is called underwriting," said 
Wendt. A credit at the 
beginning and end of the 
programs is usually given 
for these contributions. A 
few programs are sent free 
of charge and are made 
possible through national 
underwriters. 

Another factor that 
makes WIPU unique is that 
most of the persons involved 
are volunteers. "The whole 
station runs on volun- 
teers—they keep the station 
on the air for IB hours a day, 
seven days a week," said 
Wendt. He indicated that 
more volunteers are needed 
all the time. 

WIPU program guides are 
available free of charge by 
calling the station. 

The station welcomes 
announcements of student 
activities and wilt air them 
throughout the broadcast 



Lobbying 

committee 

forming 

Bob Griebel and Steve 
Westrtck were in 
Indianapolis on Feb. 7 to 
represent IPFW's Students' 
Government on a newly 
formed student lobbying 
committee. 

The Statewide Student 
Lobby Agenda Steering 
Committee, consisting of 
representatives from 
Indiana University, South 
Bend; IPFW; Indiana 
University, Southeast; 
Indiana University, 
Bloomington; Butler 
University; and Ball State 
University have agreed to 
form an organization to 
provide communication 
between the schools and the 
legislature for effective 
lobbying at the State House. 

Bills of common student 
interest, upon approval of 
the respective student 
governments, will be lobbied 
for by a unified body of this 
organization. 

Bills being considered at 
this time are HB 1508, 
concerning landlord-tenant 
laws, and HB 1541, dealing 
with financial aid and 
scholarship programs, 
which was passed by the 
House on Feb. 6 by a vote of 
89-0. 

Donations 
to aid blind 

By JACKIE WIOKA 

StaK Writer 

The Delta Gamma 

Sorority has donated $289.15 
to the visually impaired, 
according to Debbie Grimm, 
counselor for disabled 
students. The money will be 
used to help set up a 
microcomputer system with 
a voice synthesizer. 

Grimm explained that the 
voice synthesizer costs about 
51,000, and that the gift from 
the sorority will only cover a 
small part of the total price. 
"But every little bit helps," 
Grimm said, "and I'm 
hoping that more people and 
organizations will decide to 
contribute to this important 
project."

Assistant joins staff 



Merrill new liaison 



By JAMIE WISE 
Staff Writer 

Ann Merrill, new Assislanl 
to the Vice Chancellor and 
Dean of the Faculty Edward 
Nicholson, is looking for- 
ward to seeing more 
students in the Ad- 



ministrative offices. 

"I would think a student 
would be very interested in 
our offices," she said. 
"Academic offices have a 
bad reputation. They are 
looked upon as a no-man's

Although she professes 

that she Is not sure what her 
exact duties will be, she has 
been hired as Nicholson's 
faculty liaison and will 
report directly to him. 

"I will give any kind of 
administrative support Dr 
Nicholson needs and I will 
certainly see members of 
faculty if Dr. Nicholson is 
unavailable," she said. 

The 30-year-old Buckeye 
leaves her position as ad- 
ministrative assistant to the 
dean of the College of 
Business at Wright Slate 
University where she for- 
merly worked with 
Nicholson to get involved in 
all areas of responsibility. 
Salaries, budgeting, staffing, 
curriculum and also faculty 
recruitment arc a few 
Merrill mentioned 

Merrill also pointed out 
rii.n many students are not 
aware of the responsibility of 
the administrative offices. 

"If there is an image 
problem, students need to 
understand that our purpose 
is the operation of this 
university. We deal with 
students, student problems, 
academic issues as well as 
coordination with the main 
campus and other regional 
campuses," she said. "Also, 
in these administrative 
offices, all business of the 
National Student Exchange 
and the Weekend College are 



conducted. And these are 
very important to students." 

Merrill feels that she has 
much In common with 
students of this campus. She 
spent 10 years on her un- 
dergraduate degrees 
(sociology and business) 
while employed on a part- 
time and full-time basis. 
Even now she intends to 
enroll in a suitable master's 
program on campus. 

After expressing an in- 
terest in getting involved 
with the IPFW community 
as well as the Fort Wayne 
community, she mentioned 
that she worked on the 
United Cerebral Palsy 
Telethon where she was able 
to meet students and faculty 
and "work for a good cause, 
too." 

She has taken up dance 
again by attending classes at 
the Fort Wayne Ballet School 
and would like to join the 
local chapter of the national 
honorary society for 
sociology, Alpha Kappa 
Delta, of which she is a 

Merrill feels there will be 
more time to devote to such 
activities once she and her 
husband, an engineer with 
the city Water Pollution 
Control Department, are 
settled. "We moved here on

O'Reilly directs comedy 



PIT prepares 



By NANCY SLICK 
Staff Writer 

!The next production at 
Purdue-Indiana Theatre 
(PIT) will be "Tartuffe,'" a 
comedy by the 17th Century 
playwright Jean Baptiste 
Poquelin Moliere 

The play is being directed 
by Maureen O'Reilly, who 
has been in Port Wayne since 
August. She recently 
directed PIT'S production of 
"What the Butler Saw," and 
is currently teaching 
directing and acting styles 
classes 

She enjoys directing "very 
much" and is especially 
enthusiastic about "Tar- 
tuffe" because it is a stylized 
play. "Style-wise it's similar 
to! the movie Tom Jones,' 
although it is not as risque." 
The dialogue is in rhymed 
couplets. 

j-'Tartuffe was first 
presented in three acts at the 
tqw festival of Les Plaisirs 
de ITle Enchantee at Ver- 
sailles. The .production 
caused a violent controversy 
over the thought (hat Moliere 
was insulting the clergy. 

King Louis XIV forbade 
public performances of the 
play, despite his personal 
delight with i(. and it wasn't 
until three-years later that 
Moliere amended the play 
and presented it on Aug 5, 
1667. Unlort tin ately, the 
Iheatre was closed down, 
and it wasn't until another IB 



months had passed before 
the play could be publicly 
presented, this time lo result 
in its prolonged success. 

The plot, as it stands 
today. sees Tartuffe 
pretending religiousness in 
order to befriend the wealthy 
Orgon, who invites him (o 
stay at his house. Tartuffe 
promptly tries to steal his 
money and seduce his wife, 
Elm ire. 

In the sub -plot, Orgon 
promises his daughter, 
Mariano's hand in marriage 
to Tartuffe, but she is 
already in love with Valere. 

As a youth, Moliere saw 
the "commedia dell' arte" 
players who travelled 
throughout Europe. The 
commedia players played 
generalized, stock 

characters that, for each 
production, were thrown into 
new situations, and Moliere 
adopted the practice of using 
these stock characters in his 
writing. 

"Besides his ability to 
create characters, Moliere's 
abilities excelled in creation 
of situation and comic in- 
terest. These elements 
appear best in his great 
comedies of character, in 
which he ridicules a vice or 
type of ejtcess by 
caricaturing a person in- 
carnating it. "Tartuffe" is a 
great comedy of character 
that ridicules the religious 
hypocrite. 



O'Reilly is very excited 
about the play's elaborate 
costuming. In fact, she says, 
"the focus in the production 
is very much on the 
costuming." The costumes 
were designed by Patty 
Sweet and are handcrafted. 

"Tartuffe" opens on Mar. 
6 and plays on weekend.* 
through the 21st. Tickets will 
be available from the box 
office one week before the 
show.

Kinetic, visceral, vibrant. 
You can sum up any Ken 
Russell film with those 
words. 

Russell's strongpoint as a 
filmmaker is his unique 
visual slyle and composition. 
At his best, in films like 
"Women in Love," "The 
Devils," and "The 
Boyfriend." Russell com- 
bines his flair for visuals 
with unique or elaborate 
storylines to keep your eyes 
riveted to the screen. Even 
his bad films, and he has 
made such turkeys as 
"Tommy" , and "Liz- 
stomania," create a visual 
tension that won't let you 
take your eyes away, no 
matter how rotten the film 

Russell simply compels 

you to look at his films. In 
"Altered Slates," Russell 
sends this compulsion to new 
heights. And, not so coin- 
cidentally, compulsion is 
what the film is about. 

Based on Paddy 
Chayefsky's novel, the film 
deals with Dr. Edward 
Jessup's compulsive search 
for some sort of ultimate 
truth about the human 
psyche. His search leads him 
into experiments with mind- 
expanding drugs. 

Russell makes the most of 
this plot and "States" moves 
at a frantic pace, driving the 
audience ever deeper into 
Jessup's impulses. Each 
shot seems to convey a state 
of conciousness. The 
dialogue is spoken at a

The film contains Russell's 
most ornate opticals yet. and 
thty are mind-boggling 
special effects. Russell and 
special effects designer 
Bnian Ferrin explode the 
screen in a kaleidoscope of 
colors, images and patterns. 
The effects provide Russell a 
chance to cu(| loose and 
exaggerate his style to the 
utmost. In "Altered States" 
he really has fun. 

Even though the special 
effects almost dwarf (he 
actors, Russell never lets 
you forget that the 
characters are human 
beings. William Hurt is good 



as Jessup. He makes the 
audience care about his 
character. Blair Brown', as 
Emily, Jessup's wife, is 
excellent. She creates a 
three-dimensional portrait 
out of a sketchily written 
character. 

As good as the film is, it is 
far from flawless. Russell 
goes overboard a little with 
his use of sound and blasts 
your ear drums. He also 
spends too much time on the 
ape sequence, which seems 
melodramatic and adds 
nothing to the film. These 
things aside, "Altered 
States" is a fine film that is 
likely to be one of the best 
science fiction films this 
year. 



Party sets up 
'Radiothon 9 



Bv TIM SMITH 
Staff Writer 

"Our goal is to bring the 
philharmonic to the com- 
munity as a whole," said 
Diane Keoun, chairman of 
the Radiothon sponsored by 
the Women's Committee of 
the Fort Wayne Philhar- 
monic and WXKE radio. 

The kick-off dinner and 
party last Friday night at 
Zoli's Chalet showed an 
excellent turn out and if that 
is any indication of the 
success of the Radiothon 
itself, the ladies are in real 
good shape. 

The decorations for the 
party, done in a country- 
western theme, included a 
western town (built inside 
Zoli's) designed by local 
artist Roger Hultquist. , 
Guests to the town were'' 
treated to such activities as 
digging for gold, readings by 
Lola the palmist and visiting 
a photo shop and general 
store. Lola, who is an actual 
palmist and medium, 
donated her time. All the 
gold items and film were 
donated by local philhar- 
monic patrons. 

Arvel Bird and his band 
provided country-western 
and bluegrass music for the" 
shindig. Arvel, wMlsoJie'ot ' 
the area's hottest fiddle 
players, was well received 
by the crowd who showed 



their expertise at hoedown 
dancin'. Arvel Bird will be 
appearing with the 
Philharmonic on Feb. 28 for 
a pops concert. 

The Radiothon itself will 
be held Feb. 21 and 22 for 37 
hours solid and will be aired 
on WXKE. WXKE was 
chosen to bring the 
Philharmonic to a broader 
base of the community, to 
expand its audience and get 
the young more involved. 

Donations to the 

Philharmonic will not go 
unrewarded. For each 
donation a premium will be 
given to the contribute* - The 
list of premiums ranges 
from a Dolly Parlon T-shirt 
to a dinner for six prepared 
by gourmet cooks, A 
catalogue containing a full 
list of the premiums will be 
made available through both 
Fort Wayne newspapers an 
■Feb. 12-13 and through local 
merchants. 

Donations to this unique 
method of fund raising can 
be made by one of three 
methods: through pre-mail 
pledge, by call in pledge 
during the Radiothon, and by 
donating directly at 
Tomkipson's Chrysler- 
Plymouth. 

The Fort Wayne 
Philharmonic exists for the 
community as a whole, not

Goliath 4, David 



By JENS M. 
SORENSEN 
Staff Writer 

Remember the story 
about David and Goliath? 
Well, odds are that 
Goliath would win 99 of 
100 fights if the two met 
again. 

Upsets grab the 
headlines, but in reality 
the gianl wins most of the 
time. "Golialh stomps, 
mutilates and destroys 
David" just doesn't lend 
itself to exciting copy. 

The Tusker men's 
volleyball team invaded 
the land of the giants last 
weekend. No, they didn't 
win. And Afghanistan 
hasn't knocked off 
Russia. But that hasn't 
stopped them from 
fighting. 

The IPFW volleyball 
squad, all nine of them, 
traveled to Columbus for 
the Ohio State 

Invitational. They 
returned to Fort Wayne 
with assorted bumps, 
bruises and an 0-4 record. 
The score reads Goliath A, 
David 0. 

For the record, the 
losses were to Cincinnati. 
Pittsburgh, Ball State and 
the University of Win- 
nipeg (Canada), all in 



strs 



it sets. 



"That's all right. We'll 
get better," commented 
coach Arnie Ball, who 
obviously knew whal he 
was in for. 

Ball started three 
freshmen in the Tuskers' 
first matches of the 



season at OSU. 
team's inexperience 
manifested itself in three 
areas, Ball said: con- 
sistency, defense and 
pass serving. Pass ser- 
ving, he explained, is 
selling an opponent's 
serve to a designated spot 
on the court to begin the 
offense. 

"If you don't pass 
serve, you don't play 
offense. You play 
defense," Ball said, "and 
you can only play defense 
for so long.". 

After watching his 
team's initial per- 
formance of the season, 
Ball concluded, "There 
are a number of areas 
where we really have to 
work." 

However, the coach did 
note a few bright spots. 
"In each of the matches, 
we were able to play with 
Ihe learns up to a certain 
point, when we lost our 
intensity," he said. In Ihe 

Winnipeg, the Tuskers 
were up 6-5. Ball pointed 
out, only to lose 6-15. 

Momentum is very 
important in volleyball, 
he explained In sports 
such 'as basketball and 
football, when a team 
gives up points, it goes 
back on offense — not so 
in volleyball. The winner 
ol the poinl serves again. 
That, he said, makes it 
tough to regain the 
momentum from Ihe 
other team. 

Ball also cited the in- 



dividual play of junior 
Paul Wyss as a bright 

The Tuskers continue 
their schedule of rough 
pre-conference tour- 
naments this weekend. 
They will compele in (he 
16-team Pittsburgh 
Invitational. IPFW will 
battle Ohio State, which 
defeated Ball State in five 
sels in the title game last 
weekend, Cincinnati, a 15- 
5, 15-10 winner over the 
Tuskers last weekend, 
and Army for the right to 
compete in the finals.

Women's basketball coach 
Peggy Voisin sees better 
days ahead for her IPFW 
squad. "The girls are just so 
frustrated at this point," 
Voisin stated. That 
frustration was evident in 
last week's losses to Saint 
Joseph's and Hanover. 

On Thursday, the team 
traveled to play Saint 
Joseph's. The three hour ride 
to Rensselaer resulted in a 
83-52 loss. Saint Joseph's 
posed several problems for 
the Tuskers, as they were a 
taller, more experienced 
club. 

Commenting on the road 
loss Voisin said, "you can't 
lurn the ball over twenty 
times, shoot under 30 percent 
from the floor and expect to 
win the game." 

The Saint .Joseph's game 
was a disaster from the 
start. The only time IPFW 
came close was at the outset 
of the second half when the 
Tuskers ran off eight 
straight points. 

Kathleen Smith led the 
Tuskers with 19 points and 13 
rebounds. Karen Dirckson 
chipped in with 12 points. 
Saint Joseph's was the last 
Division II team on the 
Tusker regular season 
schedule. 

The long ride back to Fort 
Wayne took its toll on the

again it was a taller, more

The Tuskers trailed at the 
half by ten points 44-34, but 
the roof fell in after that 
poinl. A tough Hanover 
pressed caused many IPFW 
turnovers, and it didn't take 
long for the Tuskers to lose 
concentration. 

Once again Kathleen 
Smith paced the scoring 
parade with 22 points and 18

Tuskers end losing streak 



ByELLIEWOLLMAN

An impressive win against 
DePauw broke the Tuskers' 
losing streak, but victory 
was short-lived. 

On Feb. 3, the Tuskers 
true style reappeared as 
DePauw fell victim to IPFW, 
S6-74. 

"It was a thinking game as 
opposed to impulsive play," 
said head coach Ken Work- 
man. "We clearly displayed 
improved floor play, more 
deliberate moves and less 
forcing of the ball." 

An even exchange during 
the first-half was highlighted 
by fPFW's Phil Shideler's 
35-foot desperation shot at 
the buzzer, leaving a half- 
time Tusker edge of 38-32. 

Second-half play remained 
tight until the seven minute 
mark when the Tuskers 
closed in on DePauw. As 
Workman described it,' 



split their lull-court pressure 
and look the ball down for 
easy inside layups to build an 
11 point lead." 

' With three and a half 
minutes to play, the 
Tuskers breezed into a delay 
offense to run time off the 
clock and wrap up the vic- 
tory. 

"It was a 40-minute per- 
formance," Workman said. 
"We played 40 minutes of 
prelty credible basketball," 

Tusker scoring was topped 
by an excellent floor game. 
Rickie Smith made 23 points, 
Gary Bush hit 16, Brian 
Grady added 13, Gary 
Rinard (playing injured) hit 
11, and Ron Bojrab chipped, 
in 7. 

Last Sat., Wabash quickly 
ended the Tusker glory as 
IPFW was dumped, 97-70. 

Two minutes inlo the first- 
half Wabash pul the Tuskers 



shock by hitting four field 
goals. 

"Lots of speed, good 
shooting, and total 
aggressiveness," said Work- 
man about the Wabash team. 
"Wabash just took off and we 
couldn't adjust quickly 
enough to their pace." 

TheTuskers did manage to 
regain some composure and 
ended the first-half trailing 
40-34. "But the instanl the 
second-half began, we got hit 
by lightning all over again." 
said Workman. 

Wabash immediately 
scored eight straight points 
and kept out-of-reach of the 
Tuskers until a 22-point lead 
was built up 12 minutes into 
the second half. 

The Tuskers attempted a 
comeback and tried to even 
out the pace but recovery 
was impossible as Wabash 
left the Tuskers behind, 97- 
70.

The quiet revolution is here. People young and old all 
across Ihe country are following the Irend away from high 
speed, noisy, energy consuming high dollar sporls to easy 
paced back-to-nature activities. 

Are you ready lo stop dreaming about summer to find 
out why anyone would put a "Think Snow" bumper 
sticker on their-car? Do you enjoy snow skiing, but find 
the three or four hour drive to your favorite resort 
restrictive? Cross-country skiing just might be theanswer 
to your winter blues. All it lakes Is a few inches of snow, a 
minima] amount of gear, and some open ground. Cross- 
country skiing has been gaining In popularity for the past 
decade, offering not only exciting outdoor activity but a 
break away from high cost resorts and large crowds. 

Cross-country skiing is like taking u bike, only you do it 
with skis attached lo your reel There arc several types or 
classes of cross-country skiing, they range from racing to 
back packing. The type sklinn you do will determine the 
requirements of equipment you need T.\- biolu gear 
consists of skis, bindings (mechanical device attached to 
ski which holds boo! to skit, ski shoes or booLs. and ski 
poles. According lo Mike Loney of Water Meisler Sports. 



making sure you have the right equipment to match your 
personal build and skiing use can mean the difference 
between having a good or bad ski outing. The basics to get 
started will cost from $90 lo $185 depending on the quality 
of the merchandise you choose. 

To keep warm while you are skiing, remember many 
layers of clothing are better than one large coat. For your 
feet, never wear cotlon socks. They hold moisture close to 
your foot which is why even with Iwo or three pair your 
feet still gel cold. A pair of wool socks wilh a light pair of 
silk or nylon socks inside is the hot set-up for your feet. 

Unlike many sports which need special areas or courts, 
cross-country skiing can he practiced wherever ground is 
available. 

In Ihe Fort Wayne area, supervised cross-country 
skiing, ski rental, and ski instruction are available al the 
following locations: Lindenwood and Fox Island Wildlife 
Perserve, Chaln-O-Lakcs, Salamoni, and Pokagon slate 
parks. Unsupervised skiing is available al three city 
parks: Foster, Franke, and Shoaff. There is a small cost 
for use of supervised facilities. 

If cross-country skiing sounds like the sport to put some 
fun in your winter, contact Ihe Fort Wayne Park Board or 
your local ski shop for more information.
