BV KIM TETER 

Staff Reporter 

By fall, 1990, IPFW should be ex- 
pecting the completion of a new, 300- 
seat theatre. The new fine arts com- 
plex will include a new 2,000 square- 
foot performance space, department 
of theatre offices, classrooms, an 
orchestra pit, and adjunct areas. 

The performance space will be a 
modified proscenium which is specifi- 
cally designed to be "state of the art." 
The old Purdue-Indiana Theatre is a 
converted television studio in Kettler 
Hall which now seats about 120-130 
people. 

Separate dressing room facilities for 
men and women are also planned for 
the new theatre, with connecting rest- 
rooms. Presently the actors have to 
share a classroom which is located 120 
feet from the stage and a women's 
public restroom must be closed for 
their use. 

A greenroom will also be built 
where actors and the crew can pre- 
pare. At the entrance of the new 
theatre will be a covered drive-up, 
where theatre patrons can be dropped 
off. The lobby will have a gallery/ 
display area of the department of fine 
arts. 

The new theatre is being built partly 
by a $3 nullum gift from the 
Foellinger Foundation. The gift equals 
the largest gift ever received in the 
Purdue University system. 

The 60,000 square foot arts complex 
will cost $8.68 million. Of that total, 
$4.68 million in state support to re- 
place current fine arts facilities were 
approved by the Indiana General As- 
sembly. The university matched the 



Foellinger gift with $1 million. 

Helene Foellinger, former publisher 
of the Fort Wayne News -Sentinel, died 
in March, 1987, and left her estate to 
the Foellinger Foundation. While she 
was alive, Foellinger had expressed 
an interest for a new theatre at IPFW. 
Among her many activities on behalf 
of IPFW were the IPFW Community 
Advisory Council and the Helmke 
Library Endowment Drive 

In a recent news release, Carl D. 
Rolfson, president of the Foellinger 
Foundation, stated, "We are proud to 
make this significant gift to the uni- 
versity. The university is an important 
factor in the community; and through 
this gift, we are fulfilling Helene's 
desire that the community be the 
primary beneficiary of grants made 
by the foundation. 

Chancellor Tom Wallace observed 
that PIT has been and will continue to 
be one of the university's most visible 
bridges to the community. "We are 
extremely appreciative of this mag- 
nificent contribution from the 
Foellinger Foundation," stated 
Wallace. 

Among the planned technical 
features for the new theatre will be a 
computer-controlled memory lighting 
system, a stereo sound system, 
acoustics designed to enhance musical 
productions, comfortable theatre 
seats, and a climate control for 
audience and performer comfort. 

Some of the space will be allocated 
for a scene shop which will allow the 
construction, painting, and assembly 
of the scenery ; scenery storage ; 
property storage; a costume shop; 
costume storage; a ticket office; and 
an acting and dance studio which will 



Faculty evaluations lobbied 



BY DAVID N. BENSON 
Staff Writer 

Faculty evaluations. SUBOG, and 
discussions with Chancellor Tom 
Wallace were the major issues of the 
Wednesday, Oct. 21, Student Senate 
meeting. 

President Kurt Gregory announced 
he would like to see Students' 
Government maintain student evalu- 
ations on every IPFW professor. 
Gregory explained students would 
come to the Students' Government 
office at the end of each semester and 
fill out a form similar to the thirteen 
question evaluation form used at IU- 
B looming ion. Students could then use 
the evaluations to determine which 
professor to take. 

Gregory said the evaluations could 
be of great help especially by 
freshmen. "1 don'I know about you, 
but I really got screwed over when I 
was a freshman." Gregory said. He 
also said the evaluations could be 
useful in determining a Students' 
Government position in faculty tenure 
cases. 

Nonetheless, start-up costs could be 
as high as five thousand dollars. 
Gregory also anticipates that 
Students' Government would have to 



purchase a computer and hire 
someone to run the program. Vice- 
President Phil Downs has assigned the 
project to the Student Affairs 
committee. 

The Student Union Board of 
Governors is now the Student Affairs 
Board (SAB, pronounced sahb). The 
move came on a constitutional 
amendment by Constitution Com- 
mittee Chair Robert Bishop, who said 
he introduced the measure at the re- 
quest of SAB members. Downs 
praised the action and said, "People 
would see 'Student Union Board of 
Governors' and would think they do 
what Senate does. You know, a bunch 
of pre-law type nerds." 

A lunch with Wallace, held the day 
before the meeting, was also dis- 
cussed. Gregory, in his report, said 
Wallace is interested in redecorating 
the Green Room in the Walb Memorial 
Union basement and directed all ideas 
to the Chancellor's office. 

Downs added the chancellor is 
looking for a campus body to ratify 
the changing of the IPFW school 
colors from red and gold to blue and 
white. Downs called on all Senators to 
collect students' opinions on the color 
change. 



Computers added to Walb 

BY JOEL L. CARLIN 
Surf Writer 

Room 125 in the Walb Student Union is now a new computer room. Formerly 
known as the Music Room, the 1986- '87 Student Senate felt that the space was 
not being used, and therefore it was decided that a new VAX/PC computer 
cluster would be a more appropriate use of space. 

However, although the room's purpose has changed, most of the equipment is 
not new. Fifteen terminals were moved from Kettler's computer lab. 

Three new computers were purchased by the computer/data processing 
department at a cost of about $4,250. A phone line, which provides users with 
access to data processing in Kettler. was also installed for approximately $1,000. 
The project data was overseen mostly by Paul Strouts of the Continuing 
Education office. 

The lab hours are: weekdays, 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Saturday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.; 
and Sunday, noon to 10 p.m. 

Strouts would like to emphasize the availability of this and the other computer 
rooms around campus. He urges students to look at the new cluster because few 
students are using it. This sentiment was reaffirmed by Student Body President 
Kurt Gregory who has informally talked with the computer users. He said that 
they "like its availability and really like the telephone." 

At the present time, seven of the 15 monitors are operational. The others will 
be hooked up in the near future. Air message manuals and a documentation 
rack are present. Next door at the Sweet Shoppe students can check out DOS or 
the File Express word processor. This allows students to stop in and get a 
"byte." 



feature a "floating" dance floor with 
mirrors and a barre. 

The old PIT will be used for ex- 
pansion of student/classroom pro- 
ductions, theatre workshops and 
lectures, small and/or experimental 
productions, and for directing students 
for their use for class projects. 

PIT began during the 1964 season, 
Through the summer of 1987, PIT has 
presented 136 productions involving 
about 3,000 individuals on stage and 
backstage The department of theatre 
has three full-time faculty members 
and one associate faculty member. 

Steven Sarratore, chairman of the 
department and assistant professor of 
theatre, joined the university in 1986. 
Sarratore teaches all the technical 
fields of theatre and designs PIT pro- 
ductions. Sarratore stated in a news 
release, "The new theatre will allow 
the department to do some needed 
expansion and will make the depart- 
ment more attractive to prospective 



students." 

One of the other two full time 
faculty members Is Larry Life, as- 
sistant professor of theatre, who 
joined the IPFW faculty in 1971. Life 
teaches acting, directing, and dance/ 
movement and directs PIT 
productions. 

Joel Murray was also assistant pro- 
fessor of theatre when he joined the 
faculty in 1985. Murray teaches acting, 
directing, theatre history, and drama- 
tic literature and directs PIT 
productions. 

Ruth Laurion Bowman, associate 
faculty and PIT costumer, joined the 
IPFW staff in 1986. Besides designing 
costumes for all regular season PIT 
productions, she leaches courses on 
costuming. 

The firm of James &amp; Associates 
Architects and Engineers, Inc., will 
design the new fine arts complex and 
theatre. Construction should begin in 
I9B8 and be completed by 1990.

Smoking issue raises 
questions in Senate 

BY DAVID N.BENSON 
Staff Writer 

In their meeting on Monday, Oct. 19, the IPFW Faculty Senate voted 
unanimously to consider abolishing the smoking in private offices pending 
impact studies. 

The move comes on a resolution introduced by political science chair Mike 
Downs, which calls for banning smoking in private offices "pending completion 
of environmental/engineering studies" and "urges" Chancellor Wallace to make 
the results available before the entire smoking policy will be reviewed next 
spring. 

The resolution also says many view permitting smoking in private offices as 
"discriminatory." Under the current smoking policy, individuals may declare 
their offices smoking areas. 

In floor debate, Downs quoted the Surgeon General, the American Heart and 
the American Lung Association, as saying that permitting smoking in private 
offices "where the number of air exchanges per hour is fewer than six places a 
real strain on individuals and the system." 

Downs then quoted Physical Plant Director Don Katter as saying the number 
or air exchanges in the Classroom-Medical Building ranges between three and 
four, which Downs said was below the standard. "Thai doesn't mean it's 
dangerous; that's the one thing I couldn't get a handle on." 

Downs, who has argued permitting smoking in private offices discriminates 
against "low-status individuals," particularly women, released a survey of 
IPFW's secretarial staff. 

Downs had sent out 133 questionnaires at his own expense. Of the 103 
responses, 66 thought the policy was unfair. Downs also said 20 percent thanked 
him for asking but "at least one said I had no business bothering women." 

Philosophy Professor Kathy Squadrito, who last month challenged Downs to 
provide empirical evidence, told the political science chair. "I appreciate your 
work on that very much. I really do." 

Squadrito also said that il a study "deemed" sidestream smoke "to be 
dangerous," she would assume a campus-wide ban would follow. 

"I smoke, but I don't smoke in my own home. If that stuff (sidestream 
smoke) is bad why can't we just say if you want to smoke, go outside? It would 
get rid of all discrimination, bad feelings and dangerous health effects." 

Nonetheless, Downs' questionnaire proved controversial. In floor debate. 
Downs said he got a memo from Vice-Chancellor John Carnaghi, who labeled 
the whole thing as "nonsense." 

In an interview Thursday, Carnaghi said he did not want to start a battle with 
Downs but said the questionnaire was "poorly put together" with only one 
question, and he "challenged why it was not sent to computer operators and lab 
technicians" who also have to live with the policy. 

In an interview the same day, Downs defended the questionnaire by pointing 
out that it had a comment section arid challenged the vice-chancellor to do a 
more far-reaching survey. 



Opinion 



The Communicator 



Thurndav, October 29, 1987 



Take responsibility and 
exercise your right to vote 



nearly November 3. ..do you 
know where your voter's registra- 
tion card is? 

But what does IPFW have to do 
with the mayoral race? A lot of 
students may forget that IPFW, as 
a commuter campus, is more in- 
volved with area jpolitics than IU- 
Bloominglon or Purdue-West La- 
fayette. That may not be wise to 
overlook. 

Local politics, on the city or 
council level, may not appear to 
have much effect of a state uni- 
versity, but the students who attend 
IPFW are affected. 

While many IPFW students do 
not live within the city limits, a 
large percentage does. This means 
these students are faced with the 
decision of choosing a candidate. 

The 1987 mayoral race has been a 
hot topic with the area press lately. 
But whether voting for the Re- 
publican Candidate Paul Helmke, 
the Democratic incumbent Win 
Moses, or, possibly, the Boneheads 
Charlie Butcher and Tony 
Richards, students should consider 
how his or her vote can effect his/ 
her future. 

Will the candidate(s) support his 
promises? Can he/they function in 
the office? Will he/they be able to 
handle crises? Will Fort Wayne be 
a better city with him/them as 
mayor? 

The questions are numerous, but 
a student must take the responsi- 
bility of taking part in an election 
to choose his/her leaders. Many 
people don't vote, then for the next 
three or four years complain that 
the elected official is incompetent. 



Yet they do not acknowledge that 
their vote, or lack of, may have 
changed the entire outcome of the 
election. 

That may seem a little exagger- 
ated, but many elections have been 
that close, and if there are 25 of 
those non-voters, then those 25 are 
even more important. 

The Constitution of the United 
States grants the American people 
the right to elect by vote their 
choice for a government office. Not 
every country can claim that abil- 
ity, and if we as a nation intend to 
continue, then we must take part. 

Voting should, however, be taken 
seriously. It isn't just something 
one does to be considered a good 
citizen. A voter should look at the 
issues, evaluate the candidates, 
and apply reasoning to their choice. 
Don't vote for a candidate because 
he is a Republican or a Democrat, 
or because he seems sincere. Read 
between the lines, take care to 
choose whoever is best for the job. 

This election doesn't stop with 
the mayor, either. It is a city-level 
election, so offices for all six 
council districts are open, in addi- 
tion to the three council-at-large 
positions and the office of city 
clerk. 

Council members are the city- 
level equivalent to U.S. Congress- 
men. They vote on all city or- 
dinances and legislation and also 
vote for appropriations and 
spending. 

So take time to place your vote 
this year. It will make a difference. 
Exercise your right to vote.

New weights needed soon 



MiJ 0. lf» Iftdlinj l\ 



The Communicator 






cti LW-. Inl ■» tjipviiofij tie n» n 



To The Editor: 

After lifting weights in 
the weight room here at 
IPFW during this first 
semester, I have discovered 
a problem that could be 
eliminated. I would like to 
see new dumbbells installed 
in the weight room to pre- 
vent the hassles that exist 
with the present ones. Not 
only are they time consum- 
ing, but they are also 
inconvenient. 

These present dumbbells 
take too much time to add 
or 'subtract weight I have 



to find the proper wrench 
that fits the bolts that hold 
on the weights. Half of the 
time I cannot even find 
these wrenches. When I add 
weight as I do more sets, it 
takes more time than it is 
worth to change weight. I 
actually spend more time 
changing weight than 1 do 
lifting. 

With a new rack of steel 
dumbbells, ranging from 
ten pounds to seventy 
pounds, the problems- of 
wasted time and inconven- 
ience would be eliminated. 
The majority of the time I 



would be using a different 
weight than someone else, 
therefore, I would not have 
to wait. I realize that new 
dumbbells will cost quite a 
bit of money, but it will 
benefit everyone who uses 
the weight room. My fellow 
weight lifters and I would 
really appreciate it if new 
dumbbells would be in- 
stalled in the weight room 
sometime in the near 
future.

Slaff Writer 

IPFW will never win the 
Rose Bowl. Nor will they 
ever win an NCAA cham- 
pionship in basketball— un- 
less they move to the Divi- 
sion I circuit. 

But in volleyball, one can 
find a national contender 
year in and year out. Vol- 
leydon Coach Arnie Ball 
knows what it takes to be a 
winner. 

Ball, now entering his 
seventh season at IPFW, 
has sipped from the cup of 
success frequently. Last 
season, the men's team 
ranked as high as twelfth in 
the nation at one point, 
while the women's squad 
reached number 14. 

Ball also has proven to be 
successful' internationally. 
This past summer he led his 
team to the gold medal in 
the Olympic Festival. Ball 
was one in an elite group 
chosen to coach during the 
festival. "It's quite an 
honor to be chosen to have 
that opportunity," he said, 
and "a pleasure to work 
with the future of 
volleyball." 

During the festival, which 
was held at Oklahoma City, 
Ball coached one or the four 
regional teams. After 
dropping the opening match 



in the gold medal round, his 
North team defeated the 
West region in the next 
three matches for the vic- 
tory. IPFW standouts John 
Jaworski and Marcus Vuich 
and Ball's son Lloy were 
members of the losing 
silver medalist squad. 

In addition to the 1987 
Olympic Festival, Ball 
coached the 1983 Sports 
Festival and the 1985 World 
University Games as well. 

Despite his success in 
volleyball, Ball did not be- 
come interested in the 
game until his sophomore 
year of college. 

"I wasn't as good as 1 
thought I was in baseball," 
said Ball. 

He went to Ball State 
University to pursue a 
baseball career, while vol- 
leyball was of little interest 
to him. "I thought it was a 
sissy sport," he said. 

His opinion of the game 
changed as he developed an 
interest for the sport 
midway through college. 
Now in 1987, he is one of the 
most respected coaches in 
the business. 

In coaching, Ball uses one 
plain and simple tactic to 
be successful: "We expect 
the best effort academically 
and athletically that each 
player can give us. I expect 
that from the players, the 
coaches and myself."

'Earth, Sun, Moon' 

Sinister and angelic entwine 



BY DAVE H [SM--.lt 
'Earth, Sun, Moon" 
-Ave and Rockets 
Beggars Banquet 

Well, it's definitely a 
ileasure to do a column on 
his one. The new Love and 
Rockets album has been 
ong awaited by many in 
he alternative music scene, 
ind three weeks after its 
proposed release date, it's 
n the stores. 

Review 

The members, Daniel Ash 
hi guitar and vocals, David 
). on bass and vocals, and 
Kevin Haskins on per- 
2USSion, originally formed 
with lead singer Peter 
Murphy in the notorious 
group "Bauhaus" in 1979. 

Four years later the 
group split up, all the 
members pursuing solo ca- 
reers. Ash, J., and Haskins 
soon teamed up and formed 
a band named "Tones on 
Tail" which had a minor 
climb on the charts with the 
song "Go." 

A year later, they 
changed their name again 



to Love and Rockets, after 
the London-based comic 
book of the same name. 
Their first release, "Sev- 
enth Dream of Teenage 
Heaven" was hardly rec- 
ognized, except by hardcore 
Bauhaus fans. 

With their second release 
last year , "Express," they 
won wide acclaim, and even 
made it to the top three on 
the college album chart. 
Now, with "Earth, Sun, 
Moon," the whole world is 
ready for Love &amp; Rockets. 

The album opens with 
"Mirror People," a song 
that is blatantly Love &amp; 
Rockets, with ragged edgy 
guitars and surrealistic lyr- 
ics. "The Light" follows, a 
murky song that sounds 
exactly like Bauhaus mate- 
rial, but is then in turn fol- 
lowed by "Welcome To- 
morrow," a cheerful ditty 
you would sing walking 
through a park in the 
summer. 

There is more than one 
occasion that this music 
drops into a moody, omi- 
nous Bauhaus-like tone, es- 



pecially on songs like "The 
Telephone Is Empty" and 
"Earth, Sun, Moon." 

Even the album cover is 
done in black and white, the 
trademark of Bauhaus; 
however, for each song that 
is dark, there is a light one 
to counter it. 

There is no question of 
musical ability here. Daniel 
Ash is one of the best gui- 
tarists on the scene today, 
and 1 don't use lhat phrase 
lightly. David J. is also one 
of the best in his class. Both 
of them have incredible 
voices, sounding both sinis- 
ter and angelic, depending 
on the song. Haskins is a 
more than adequate 
drummer, using very crea- 



tive rhythms. 

The genius here is in the 
way they structure their 
music, taking simple parts 
and assembling them into a 
greater whole. 

There is a hope in the al- 
ternative music world that 
Bauhaus might someday 
get back together. Neither 
Love &amp; Rockets or Peter 
Murphy are talking about it 
at all, but the images and 
messages I pick up from 
this album give me hope. At 
least 3/4 of that band is still 
making music today, and 
with this release, Love &amp; 
Rockets have achieved their 
finest work to date. 

Produced by Love and 
Rockets. **■■ out of five 
stars. A must!

about the deadly killer 
AIDS. 

Director Larry Life, as- 
sistant professor of theatre, 
stated that the play's 
"primary purpose is to ed- 



ucate people on AIDS." 

The play was written by 
Gregory Manifold, the di- 
rector of Historic Fori 
Wayne. Lincoln Li/e Insur- 
ance Co. and the AIDS Task 
Force provided grants to 
make the production possi-

in .i about AIDS. 

Life stated that AIDS is 
PIT's responsibility to the 
community to educate peo- 
ple about AIDS 

"AIDS is one of the most 
Important issues of our 
time," he said. 

According to Life, AIDS is 
on the Increase In women 
and on the downswing for 
homosexual males. "Within 
the next three years," he 
stated, "Everyone will 
know someone who has 
AIDS." 

Those appearing in the 
production are Lisa 
Haram, Chris Colcord. 
Kriss Griffiths, Becky 



Niccum, Gail Westerfield, 
Gary Lanier. 

Life states that the big- 
gest problem with AIDS is 
ignorance. "Ignorance is 
what's spreading it," stated 
Life. 

"After I'm Done Singing" 
is presented as part of AIDS 
Awareness Week. The play 
deals with how to prevent 
AIDS, how to treat a person 
who has AIDS and symp- 
toms of AIDS 

Some ways to prevent

to the American Red Cross, 
is 1, Don't have sex with 
multiple partners; 2, Avoid 



sex with people with AIDS; 
3, Don't use intravenous 
drugs. 

One cannot contract AIDS 
from a telephone, shaking 
hands, silverware, or bath- 
rooms. It is estimated that 
between one and one half 
million people are infected

symptoms, according lo the 
American Red Cross. 

This production states 
Life will not be nearly as 
explicit as "The Normal 
Heart," last year's produc- 
tion dealing with AIDS. 

Life states that "After 
I'm Done Singing" does 
refer to condoms and semen 
but in no way promotes sex. 

Despite the seriousness of 
the topic the production is 
comedy. Life said, "A great 
deal of healing needs to be 
done." He also stated 
laughter was a release from 
the tension of the topic. 
Persons with AIDS are no 
longer referred to as" AIDS 
victims". They are now 
referred to as Persons With 
AIDS (PWS).
