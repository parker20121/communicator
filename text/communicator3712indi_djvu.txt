Chris Patterson, director 
of Ihe Office oi Multicultural

that. "TTicre are many more 
(Native AmcricanJ shjdents 
who do not choose lo desig- 
nate themselves as such because 
they may be ignorant aboul, or 
ashamed of, their culture." 

She recommends that people 
take time this month to research 
their own Native American ancestry. 
Many people may not even be 
aware of their heritage for several 
reasons. "One in four Native 
American children have been 
placed in foster care. It is a black eye 
on this nation," Patterson explained. 

Also, many ate not aware that 
not all Native Americans have black 
hair and dark eyes. Centuries of

song, "I'm a Believer" by The 
Monkees on his eleclnc guitar. It 
took Scott two ycais to learn Ihe sctis. 

Another of the many high 
points in Ihe concert came when 
Ihe concert choir sang "Sweet 
Home Alabama." 

Although the performance 
was not without the occasiorul 
error, it was obvious lo the audi- 
ence Itiat each performer gave it 
his all in front of the crowd. 

Although the choir was 
good, the star of the show had to 
be Jeffrey. Jeffrey is a young boy 
who has fc&gt;een working on learn- 
ing to identify' everyday items 



the student music therapist who 
works with Jeffrey, sang a song 
telling Jeffrey to stand up out of 
his chair and to pick up a mirror. 
Jeffrey would gel out of his 
chair located center stage and 
dance around the mirror. He 
. Ihe mirror 
'eal 

Ihe crowd and finally sil back 
down in his chair, waiting for 
the next line lo begin. 

The performance was so 
touching that one either laughed 
or cried, and in fact, many of 
those in the audience did both. 
This concert taught a great les-

SlaifCotmniiisI 

Since Thanksgiving holiday 
is next week (and we nlllook for- 
ward to Ihe traditional four-day 
weekend), 1 would like lo share 
some interesting facts about 
Thanksgiving and name some 
things tnat I am thankful for. 

Thanksgiving: (Websler's) 
"Ihe act of giving thanks; a 
prayer of gratitude lo Cod; (with 
cap) ThanJisgiving Day. Also, an 
annual U.S. holiday dedicated to 
giving thanks to Cod for the ben- 
efits received during Ihe year. 
Observed on Ihc fourth 
Thursday of November in the 
United Stales, and on Ihe second 
Monday of Oclober in Canada." 

Thanksgiving actually 
commemorates the feast of 
thanks^vingheld by Ihc Plymouth 
Cotany-in-lWl for the fiist hari'est 
after aivinter of near-slarvation.AI 
the leasl, the colonists invited 
the neighboring Indians to share 
Ihc four wild turkeys caught for 
Ihe meal. Since Ihen, Thanks^ving 
Day fias been a symbol of hospi- 
tality, wilh relatives and friends 
sharing roast turkey and other 
traditional New England dishes 
such as pumpkin pie. 

My family traditionally 



meets on Thanksgiving Day, and 
Mom fixes a spectacular feast. 

who doesn't have any family or 
special plans for the day — jus! 
to .share what we have. 

We usually gather at the 
table at noon and hold hands 
while Dad says a prayer of 
thanksgiving to ■ Cod for the 
many things that we are blessed 
with such as health, family and 
friends. Sometimes ive go around 
the table, and each in lum names 
one thing Ihat he or she is thank- 
ful for. The year my lovely, 
young wife Melissa died, I 
decided not to go to the family 
Thanksgiving dinner. I didn t 
feel very thankful, but Mom put 
such a guilt trip on me that I 
went anyway. 1 still didn't feel 
thankful, bul it made Mom feel 
beller. 

In October 1863 during the 
Civil War, President Lincoln 
made a Thanksgivmg proclama- 
lion Ihat set precedence for the 
national holiday celebrated today 
Earlier, President Washington 
proclaimed Nov. 6, 1?89, the first 
Thanksgiving Day Howe\'er, there 
was no fixed annual nationwide 
festival until the Lincoln 
proclamation. Tfie oldest krxivai 
thanksgiving proclamation dates 



back lo November 1723 and was 
issued by the honorable 
Lieutcnant-Covernor William 
Dummer of Massachusetts, 
"Commander in Chief of His 
Majesty's Province of the 
Massachusetts-Bay in New 
England." This was 53 years 
' iforeourcountryaswekno " 






The 



date was set for Nov. 28, and 
George, the king of Great Britain, 
France and Ireland, ivas in the 
lenth year of his reign. At the 
bollom of the document in bold 
it reads. " GOD Save the King." 

In closing, I want to shanr 
the first and Ihe last paragraph 
from Lincoln's Thanksgiving 
proclamation. Tlic last para- 
graph is particularly fitting for 

appreciate it as I did. 

"The year that Is drawing 
towards lis close, has been filled 
with the blessings of fruitful 
fields and healthful skies. To 

corislanlly enjoyed Ihat we are 
prone to forget the source from 
wfiich they come, others have 
been added, which arc of so 
eMraordinary a nature, that they 
carmot (ail to penetrate and soften 
even the heart which is habitually 
insensible to the ever watchful 



providence of Almighty God." 

"I do, Ihcrelorc, invite my 
fellow citizens in every part of 
the Uniled States, and also Ihose 
who arc at sea and those who arc 
sojourning in foreign lands, to 
set apart and observe the last 
Thursday of November next, as 
a day of Thanksgiving and 
Praise to our beneficent Father 
who dwcllelh in the Heavens. 
And 1 rcconunend to Ihem that 
while offering up the ascriptions 
justly due I o Him for such singular 
deliverances and blessings, they 
do also, with humble penitence 
for our national perverseness 
and disobedience, commend lo 
His tender care all those who 
have become widows, orphans, 
moumeis, or sufferers in the 
lamentable civil strife in which 
we arc unavoidably engaged, 
and (crvcntly implore the 
interposition of the Almighty 
Hand lo heal the wounds of the 
nation and to restore it as soon as 
may be consistent with the 
Divine purposes to the full 
enjoyment of peace, harmony, 
tranquility and Union," 

' In testimony whereof. I 
have hereunto set my hand and 
caused the Seal of the United 
Stales lobe affiled."

Turkeyless . Striking fear into the hearts of 
Thanksgiving: chickens everywhere 



Well, this week 1 am focus- 
ing on health issues. It is ironic 
that the focus on health comes 
the W'eek before the Thanksgiving 
holiday, a day set aside to give 
thanks. Unfortunately, lo most 
people Thanksgiving means 
turkey, gravy and stulfing. Not 
(list stuffing turkeys, bul stuffing 
themselves to Ihe point of 
glultony. 

Because of this, 1 would like 
to address issues of diel, specifi- 
cally vegelarianism. While a 
large part of America is focused 
on nexl week's feast — their 
Thanksgiving turkey ^ maybe it 
is a good time lo look at Ihe 
ethical and health issues 
Involved in the eating of meal. 

Being a vegetarian is a way 
of life It is based on bolh heallh 



year, pumped full of hormones 
to promote growth, fed geneti- 
cally altered grains to reduce 
e&gt;:pense and treated in ways Ihat 
are beyond inhumane — only to 
be party lo mass slaughter. All of 
this is done for corporate profit 
and to guarantee consumer 
satisfaction. We want our meat! 

Also, for the last five years, 
it has become commonplace to 
use human DNA lo genetically 
alter pigs. This makes the meal 
more tender. II any of you took 
the lime to visit a chicken farm. 1 
am sure you would Ihink twice 
before eating another chicken. 

The chickens are raised 
from birth to death in tiny cages. 
Their beaks are clipped or 
removed, and they are declawed. 
Some companies go as fat as 
tubing the chickens for feeding. 

Additionally, our cows are 
pumped so full of hormones that 
our young girls are entering 
puberty at younger and younger 



ages. Ah yes, milk: it does a body 
good. I have also seen photos of 
cows that have been skinned 
alive. 

I am not suggesting thai all 
Americans give up their meat. (1 
actuallv eat some meat, poultry 
and fish.) What 1 am suggesting 
is Ihat we, as consumers, become 
aware. If we want to focus on 
our health, we need lo know the 
facts. Jamison Meats on Norlh 
Anthony Boulevard carries 
Amish chicken (or free range 
chicken) for a great price. The 
Three ttivers Food Co-op carries 
a full line of organically raised 
chicken, eggs, fish and turkey 
options. Yes, it is more expensive 
to eat quaLty meal, but theelhical 
and health bcDcfits are wonderfiiL 

Choosing lo eat a vegetarian 
diet, even if it is only a part of 
your overall diet, makes a world 
of difference. Choosing lo cat 

impact, not only on our health. 



bul also on our envirorunent. It 
decreases the pollution of land, 
air and water. Imagine Ihe possi- 
bilities if we were using Ihe land 
lo grow food for people rather 
than growing grains for livestock 
or grazing. For much of the 
world.meal is ea ten asa condiment 
or as an occasional addition to 
their diets. 

We have become a very 
overindulgenl and unhealthy 
nation. Amenca is leading as Ihe 
land of the fal; obesity has 
become epidemic. Yet we still 
have more and more people suf- 
fering from chronic symptoms of 
mablutrifion. We consume large 
quantities of meat, over 
processed foods, fned foods and 
sugar. We drink coffee, colas and 
alcohol ralher Ihai^ water and 
juices.

Homecoming letter 
to I PFW students 



I've been tPFVV's alhletic director /or 
a little over one year. I've hiad the chance 
to talk with many of you about ivhat 
ybu want from IPFW athletics. The one 
thing tliat continues to come back to me 
over and over (other than winning an 
NCAA Oiamp ions hip!) is value for you. 
In other words, we need lo give you 
something special for you to come back 
lo campus after you've finished your 
classes and gone home. 

We're all working very hard to do 
that. I think you'll be very surprised at 
our men's and women's basketball 
teams this year. They're young, ener- 
getic, hungry and talented. I'm not sure 
how well they'll do against some pretty 
tough opponents, but tliey won't give up! 

As we start our basketball season, 
we tliink we've created an event that 
wUl answer tlie nagging statement, 
"There's nothing to do in Fort Wayne!" 
Our men's basketball team plays its 
firsf-ever game as a certified member of 
DivTsion I on Nov, 22 at the brand-neiv 
Memorial Coliseum. You'll have the 
chance lo witness a really exciting team 
in a beautiful new facility. Plus, it's 
Homecoming! We picked the "Animal 
House" theme for Homecoming because 
it help.s us to recognize that we want lo 



create more of a college atmosphere 
than we have in the past. In keeping 
with that theme, the original partj' band 
from "Animal House, " Otis Day and Ihe 
Knights, will start playing right after the 
game is over. You get all of this just by 
showing your student ID and picking 
up your ticket. We think that's a pretly 
good value. VVe hope you do, loo! 

Check out our Web site at 
w\\-w.iphv.edu /athletics to find dales, 
times and locations of the ticket distribution. 
You'll also be able to pick up your licket 
at tlie Memorial Coliseum Ticket Office 
on the day of the game! If you want lo 
bring a friend, all an additional ticket 
willcostisS?. If you just can't make it to 
any of these locations, call Ron Clark at 
exi. 6617. We'll get a ticket to you. And, 
the earlier you show up on Nov. 22, Uie 
better your seat will be — right down on 
the floor. 

We've got 2,000 seats reser\'ed for 
you. If we fill those, I can get 2,000 more. 
Lei's fill the Coliseum with IPFW stu- 
dents and have a great time on Nov. 22. 
And from now on, lei's show everyone 
that IPFW students are a BIG part of the 
new tradition of IPFW Athletics! 
— Mark Pope, director of athletics

O-Town album a surprise, moving toward rock All night cramming sessions do more harm than good 



This is no boy b.ind Ihal you 
haur cvirr seen bcforiv From Ihal 
grcjt bubble gum pop music lac- 
lory down soulh comes OTown. 
The wartd was witness lo 
Ihe biflh of O-Town on the fail- 
ure o( 3 lelevision show called 
"Making rhi- B^nd." Season one 
began filming in Oclober 1999 
with over 1,51)0 hopeful singers 
(and Ijck there oO auditioning 
lor Ihe new band. 

Soon Ihe crowd was nar- 
roweU down lo 25, then to eight, 
seven and finally five. After band 
member Ikaika Kahoana hit Ihe 
bricks and Ohio native Dan 
Miller was added, Ihe world col- 
lectively sighed as ycl another 
boy band was compleled. 

The group proved with 
their January 2001 release Ihat 
Ihcy were not your average 
everyday boy band, bul Ihcy slill 
resembled one- While some of 
Ihe music on Ihe first CD was 
edgy, thesuilsalTransConlinenlal 
Records and J Records refused lo 
allow Ihe album lo stray away 
from Ihal oh- so wonderful boy 
band crooner sound. 

Bul alas, under Ihe guid- 
ance of Mike Mohn and Mike 
Cronin of Actual Management. 
O-Town lold Iheir manager and 
cnlerlainmcnl company owner 
Lou Pcarlman lo stick his pop 
sound where Ihe sun don'l shine- 
Then O-Town became more than 
a happy go lucky name, Ihey 
became Ihemsclves. 

To say Ihc very Icasl, 1 was 
skeptical about their November 
release, -02." However, alter lis- 
lening to the album m ils entire- 
ly, 1 arn'somewhal impressed. O- 
Tnwn showed an increasing 
desire to have Iheir own songs 
on this album, which Ihey suc- 
ceeded in doing. Amazingly , Ihe 
band's writer, Jacob Underwood, 
was the only O-Town boy not lo 
have a song on Ihe album. 

Underwood, Ihe dread - 
locked rocker, has always shown 
the strongest desire lo write, 
while at the same lime disagree- 
ing with the sound Ihal O-Town 
portrayed. Undcnvood has had 
two songs recorded by O-Town 



in Ihe pasl. "Take Me Under," co- 
writlen by Underwood and pro- 
ducer Tony Harrison, graced Ihc 
first album, and another song by 
Ihe two, "Sec You Again," was 
released on Ihe soundtrack lo the 
movie "Longshol." 

Tlic album starts out good 
With Ihe rocky song "From the 
Damage," Co-writlen by Ihe 
group s blonde-haired, blue- 
eyed Ashley Parker Aneel, Ihe 
song is considered a favorilc 
from Ihe album by all members 
of Ihe ^roiip. From that, we arc 
immediately thrust into These 
are Ihe Days." The group's debul 
single fnam this album proves 
that while O-Town is going in 
their own direction, the record 
company keeps pullii^ Ihem 
back lo the pop scene. The song 
slarls off well with Underwood's 
scratchy rock voice, but as soon 
as it becomes interesling, Ihe 
corny melodic chorus kicks in. 

And then, I cringe inside as 
"I Only Dance with You" and 
"Favorite Girl" play. While they 
aren't bad songs, Ihe hip-hop 
combined with upbeat dance 
music is surprising lo say Ihe 
very least. 

"Favorite Girl" was one of 
Ihc most lalkcd-about songs 
before the album's release due to 
Ihc fad thai it was co-ivrillen by 
rapper Nolly. "I Showed Her" is 
up nent, and this song is amaz- 
ing. At first 1 was less than 
thrilled wilh the track that seems 
to be more of a duel between 
Miller and Erik Michael Estrada. 
But Ihe more I listen, Ihe quicker 
this song becomes one of my 
favoriles from Ihe album. 
Dealing with the heartbreak 
involved with a break-up, Ihe 
song is one Ihat deep down, 
most of the world can relate lo in 

Delving back into Ihe dance 
music. O-Town comes out next 
with "Been Around the World" 
and "Make Her Say." I almost 
cried because I was laughing so 
hard when "Make Her Say" 
began lo play. The song is co&gt; 
written by southern rap mogul 
Master P and it shows. The cho- 
rus, "Make her say uhhh, nn na 
na na" is for the most pari the 
same as in every song on any 



Master P's one 
il writing ability, com- 
bined wilh Estrada's Puerto 
Rican rapping make this song a 
tittle hard to swallow. 

We go back to Ihe softer 
rock wilh "Suddenly" and my 
favorite ,lrack, "Craving." I 
believe Ihat most of the songs arc 
worlhy of airtime, but "Craving" 
outweighs them all, Anolher fea- 
ture of this song IS Ihe drum 
work of The Vandal's drummer. 
|osh Frecse. Ftivse must have a 
lot of free time Ihis summer 
because he also played Ihe 
drums on the entire Good 
Charlotte album. "Over Easy" is 
anolhersoCler rock song thai fails 
lo have any significance and 
seenu like more of a filler track 
than any Ihing else. 

The upbeat "Girl Like Thai" 
follows close behind. This track 
was shohTi coming lo life on sea- 
son three of "Making the Band." 
Co-written by band members 
Angel, Miller and Trevor Pcnick. 
along wilh LFO's Rich Cronin 
and Grand Skeem's All Dee, Ihis 
song is great if you want lo get 
up and Jancc; loo bad I don't. 

However, the song is a 
bright spot for Pcnick who seems 
to be held back on every olher 
song, Penick finally has a small 
soio part on Ihis song, as 
opposed to the other lour who 
make Iheir vocals very fell 
throughout the album. The 
wrap-up track is "Vou Can'l Lose 
Me by Diane Warren. An other- 
wise decent album ends wilh Ihis 
boring track that has the poten- 
tial to put you to sleep. 

In the end. the album is a 
decent atlcmpt, but somewhat of 
a disappointment with all o( Ihe 
dance music Ihat 1 thought O- 
Town was moving away from. 
But when they do use a rock 
style, the album is 100 percent 
worth buying. 

Who knows what Ihe future 
will hold for O-Town? With 
Underwood's recent marriage 
and the group at a crossroads. 
anything is possible now for O- 
Town. But i/ this album is any 
indication, they will just gel bel- 
ter wilh age. 



It's the nighl before a major 
exam. Thave put of/ studying, 
making every excuse as to why I 
procrastinated. This exam hap- 
pens to tie worth 40 percent of 
my final grade. So, Iheru 1 sit 
thinking 1 will just stay up all 
night sludyinc, drinking pot 
after pol of coffee. By 7 a,m, my 
brain feels overwhelmed with 
informalion, my bladder has 
been emptied 22 limes and my 
bodv is weary. Yet off I go to lake 
my big exam. 

When I get my grade, I 
gasp in horror. A "C is dcruiiie- 
ly nol what I expected, especial- 
ly after eight long hours of 
studying Wlial could have hap- 
pentsi, fwonder? Never does it 
cross my mind that depriving 
myself of sleep in order lo study 
for Ihe lest could be the cau.w 
for my resulting grade. After 
doing some research. I learned 
that sleep deprivation is ver&gt;- 
likely Ihe reason lor my poor 
academic performance. 

A report released by 
" Environmental Nutrition" 
indicates that one in three 
Americans suffers from sleep 
deprivation. Tlie average amount 
of nightly sleep is seven hours, 
short of the eight hours of sleep 
per ni^l that experts rccommend. 

What happcr\s when 1 con- 
tinually deprive myself of a 
good night's sleep? Lack of 
sleep, according lo the "Journal 
of American College Health," 
results in decreased concentra- 
tion, increased lei\slon, depres- 
sion and confusion. No wonder 
1 have been so "snippy" lately! I 
never realized poor sleep could 
lead lo such negative conse- 

auences. Yet, being loaded 
own wilh college courses, 
what am I lodo? 

"Biological Rhythm" sug- 
gests that the more 1 vary my 
sleep palterr\s, the more out of 
whack my circadian rhythm 
becomes. If I stay up all night for 
an exam and sleep 10 hours a 
nighl for the next Ihret nights to 
catch up, my circadian syslem 
remains in a delayed phase. This 



;ht cranuning followed 10 different thoughts racing 




Ihe polenlial lo become 
increasingly irritable, tense, 
depressed and unable lo 

So, 1 ask, what docs one do 
to achieve better sleep and bet- 
ter grades? My research, uncov- 
ered the following advice: 

1) Manage your time wise- 
ly. 1 decided iful selling aside spe-

TTiis will give mc my full eight

Homecoming 



inspired by lar pits such as the 
La Brea Tnr Pits in I.OS Angeles, 
Calit. The tar pits are actuallv a 
series of asphalt deposits that 
have lrapp&lt;&gt;J various types of 
animals, plants, mammals, 
birds, insects and even 
dinosaurs since the Ice Age in 
North America. 

Yet another tiisl will be Ihe 



presence 0/ the IPFW "Slomp" 
pep band. 

Noll hopes the cxcitemenl 
surrounding the game will 
draw numbers similar lo those 
at a couple oF the Dons' games 
last season, 

"It's great Ihat people want 
to come out and see really good 
Division I basketball, and I 
think our games at Ihe Coliseum 
last year were good," he said. 
"The crowds arc nice. Against 
Oakland last year, when we had 
3,000 or J, 000 people cheering 



us on, and that really helped us' 
toward Ihe end oF the game," 

He also hopes Ihis is just 
the First, and not the last, lime 
IPFW will lace Butler, 

"The Horizon League 
would be a great league lor us to 
be in. They have nine learns 
now, and we could be a travel 
Icam with Buller," Noll said, "I 
think it's a built-in rivalry with 
us and Buller, and it'll be great 
to start it at the Coliseum."
