A task force which addresses Indi- 
ana's future in the "new world order* 
released a report that included sugges- 
tions thai would better enable Indiana 
to operate in the economy. 

The International Issues Task Force 
of the Indiana Humanities Council 
issued an interim report last week that 
offered a "vision ol the possible" (or 
Indiana's international future. The 
report presented an overview of the 
progress the Task Force has made 
since its formation last December. 

The task force was created to consid- 
er issues that may determine Indiana's 
ability lo thrive in an increasingly global 
economy. The force was developed in 
response to a study conducted by 
Catarina Cregor, an expert on inlerna- 
lional afiairs. Funded by Lilly Endow- 
ment. Inc., Cregor's study offered three 



observations; a lack of communication 
between the state and inlernational- 
service organizations results in a failure 
to make Indiana competitive in a global 
economy; a duplication of services 
among these organizations weakens 
their effectiveness; and a patchwork of 
service organizations has left gaps in 
the state's ability to operate in an inter- 
national marketplace. 

According to Ken Gladish, executive 
director of the Indiana Humanities 
Council. The striking changes In East- 
ern Europe, the Pacific Rim and other 
areas o( the world are opening up com- 
pelling and enduring opportunities. To 
lake advantage of these circum- 
stances, Indiana must be perceived as 
a place that is prepared for new devel- 
opment," he said. Hence, the forma- 
tion of the Task Force, 

In Iho report issued by the Task Force 
last week, three suggestions that would 



enable Indiana to better equip rtseH for 
the international arena were made. 
The first is international school. This 
school would offer grades kindergarten 
through tweHih and would prepare slu- 
denis for global citizenship. 
Based on a bilingual educational 

"...Indiana must be 
perceived as a place 
that is prepared for 
new development. " 

—Ken Gladish 



model, the school would broaden the 
civic role in the students countries and 
the world. The international school of 
Atlanta, Ga,, would be used as a 
model. 



Student senators 
face impeachment 



By Jim Walker 
Managing Editor 

Three student senators were sus- 
pended from tfieir duties Sunday, 
pending impeachment charges 
filed by the IPSGA internal affairs 
commiHee, 

Senate internal affairs Chair Scott 
Beineke said that senators Nancy 
Barger, Mark Snyder and Sally Green 
will be brought to trial (or impeachment 
on Nov, 26. Beineke said investiga- 
tions on the three have revealed sever- 
al rule violations. 

Barger has been charged with mak- 
ing false accusations of misconduct 
against an IPFW student. According to 
Beineke, Barger accused the student 
of sexual misconduct. 

Barger denied these claims In an 
interview Tuesday. 'I didn't say tie 
attacked women, just scared Ihem. 
I know one who was terrified of 
him," sfie said, Barger went on to 
say that the charges against her 
were "merilless". 

Mark Snyder has been charged on 
four different violations. The first 
charge claims 1hal Snyder violated the 
IPSGA constitution by appointing Kevin 
Belt as an ex officio member of the stu- 
dent affairs committee on which Sny- 
der serves as a co-chair. The second 
charge claims that Snyder acted dis- 
honestly in appointing Bell. 

The third charge claims thai Snyder 
was in violation of the University's code 
ol conduct when he allegedly threat- 
ened a student, saying "You better 
watch your back," on Sept, 20. The 
charge also claims that Snyder violated 
conduct njles by smoking cigarettes in 
areas not designated for smoking. 

The final charge alleges that Snyder 
was guilty of Ihefl, misappropriation or 
misuse ol lunds or IPSGA properly, 
Snyder is accused of using IPSGA let- 
terhead stationery for personal rea- 
sons, using the IPSGA computer lo 
write notes, and using the computer to 
write papers for class. 

Snyder said thai charges against him 
have been brought lorward either 
because of racism or age discrimina- 
tion. "Both of the charges ol impeach- 
ment came againsi me this year and 
last year alter I appointed Kevin Belt, 
an Afro-American student, lo the gov- 
ernment. And the bulk of the charges 
now are abou! Kevin Bell's appoint- 
ment. I can only imagine thai there are 
racial motivations here," he said, 

Snyder said the ages ol the three 



senators facing impeachment was a 
factor. All three are close to or over 40 
years of age, he said. 

There is a cerlain resenlmeni among 
some members ol senate and llie stu- 
dent body towards older people. They 
don't want old people curing their prob- 
lems or leading the charge. I think this 
ageism could be behind the charges," 
noted Snyder. 

The third student, Sally Green, has 
been charged wilh violating the IPSGA 
constitution by failing to respond to a 
SAB member who wrote her a note 
seeking iniormation about the activities 
of the student affairs committee on 
which she serves. According to the 
charges. Green threw away a note 
from the student and said that he 
"should gel a life,' 

Green said that these charges were 
weak. "I couldn't have answered his 
questions anyway. He is a member of 
students government. He could have 
found out himsell by checking into il 
more," she said. "I did say he 'should 
get a life.' Bui that's not real offensive." 

Green thinks that the motivation 
behind Ihe impeachment charges is a 
continuance of the fjolitical turmoil in 
the senale last year. "My first inclina- 
tion is to think that this is a slop over 
from last year's dirty politics. The peo- 
ple being charged now are the same 
ones who were threatened with 
impeachment last year." 

But internal affairs Chair Beineke 
claims Ihe charges are legitimate. The 
thing is that all three of them are in vio- 
lation of the rules of the constitution. 
They were not working inside the 
framework of the government," 

Beineke denied the age discrimina- 
tion argument. There is no way. This 
is obvious because we have a 31-year- 
old student, Mike Will, on our commii- 
lee," he said, 

Beineke said that investigations on 
the three suspended senators are 
continuirng. 

Snyder said that the embattled sena- 
tors will fight on. "The easy thing for us 
to do would be to resign. But what 
would stop this McCarthyism? The 
methods being used against us are 
motivated by wanting lo stop people 
whose views you disagree with. So for 
this reason, we've chosen not to quit,' 

The three senators are currently con- 
sidering liling charges wilh the Univer- 
sity concerning the age discrimination 
allegations. 



The subcommittee of transportation 
indk:ated the need for international air 
connedions through Indianapolis, 

According to David Johnson, attorney 
with Baker and Daniels, an internatkin- 
al airport would "have far reaching 
effeas on business ,.. when part ol an 
overall long-term strategy." 

Phyllis Land Usher, senior officer for 
the Center for School Improvement and 
Performance, outlined in her committee 
report the need to strengthen the inter- 
national perspective of the present cur- 
riculum in the Indiana school systems. 

"We need our sludenis to study geog- 
raphy, foreign languages and cultures 
in addition to the so-called basics, for 
Ihese subjects are becoming Ihe new 
basics of education as we reach toward 
the 21st century." 

John Mutz, president ol Lily Endow- 
ment, was pleased with the Task 
Force, "I believe that the progress 



made by ihe International Issues Task 
Force commitlees is substantial. Their 
work is not the final destination but 
olfers a road map to help concerned 
citizens, community leaders and mem- 
bers of both the private and publk: sec- 
tors lo complete the journey toward the 
internationalization of Indiana.' 

Michael Graham, senior business 
development specialist lor the depart- 
ment of economic development of Fort 
Wayne, has been involved with Ihe 
Task Force as Mayor Helmke's proxy, 
and had shared Mulz's enthusiasm. 
"I'm excited about it. I think il will have 
some real benefits to Fort Wayne." 

According to Gladish, the final reports 
will be released in January, followed by 
three months of implementation. 'We 
want to gel Ihe information into Ihe 
hands ol the people across the state. 
We hope lo implement our ideas or find 
or creaie ihe enlilies needed to do so." 




Randall Robinson, director of TransAlrIca, gave the keynote address at last Saturday's America World Leader- 
ship Promise and Performance conference. Robinson said (hat Apartheid Is continuous In South Africa, end Ihe 
United States needs lo promote democracy In earnest not Just when it is poltllcally and economically pleasing.

disruption to classes, Richard Ritchie, 
vice chancellor of financial affairs, 
responded to the question by stating 
that the University is working with GTE, 
but there are many obstacles in trying 
to track down Ihe culprits. One of the 
problems, said Ritchie, is the Universi- 
ty's use of its own telephone system. 

Michael Downs, chair and associate 
professor of political sciences, brought 
up another problem. He slated Ihal 1he 
library's acquisition budget has not 
increased in the last three out of five 
years, bul "inliation is eating away at 
Ihe library's ability to provide not just 
access and services but monographs 
as well." Monographs are writings on a 
small area of learning. He slated thai 
Ihe library would have little if no money 
to buy monographs this year, and mon- 
ey for scientific-research support ser- 
vices has been cut. 



'It is a bad thing,* stated Downs, 
"when the acquisition budget is allowed 
to languish lo Ihe point where a univer- 
sity library cannot allocate money for 
monographs- ,., To lose a year in which 
books are going to be purchased is to 
suffer a serious setback in the abiliiy ol 
Ihe library to provide whal we think Ihal 
il needs lo provide," 

The withdrawing of support for the 
student code lor IPFW was given 
atiention by Downs, also. He slated 
that two months have passed since its 
failure to be endorsed by the faculty 
senate. It was not endorsed because 
of the removal ol a sexual orientation 
protection clause. 

Downs Stated that I.U. President 
Thomas Ehrlich addressed this issue in 
his iasi meeting al IPf=W. Ehrlich said, 
slated Downs, that there is a cost that 
must be paid in order lo be members of 
two universily syslems, "There are 
many costs which I'm willing, as an 
individual at least, to bear in order to 
maintain Ihal membership," said 
Downs, "but this is one which I am not 
willing lo bear. The spectacle of a uni- 
versity that has a student code ol con- 
duct which is not endorsed by eiiher 
the sludenis or the faculty should be an 
embarrassment which stimulates those 
directly concerned wilh the matter." 

Earlier in Ihe meeting. Downs pre- 
sented the report of Ihe laculties of 



Indiana University. He first stated Ihal 
a review was being undertaken of 
Ehrlich's performance and faculty could 
send evaluations ol Ehrlich lo the pres- 
idential review committee addressed to 
the I.U. Board ol Trustees. 

Downs then stated that the heallh 
insurance premium lor the I.U. faculty 
is going up. He included the informa- 
tion in Ihe report to make the 1,U, facul- 
ty aware ol the change, but then slated 
that the difference would be paid for by 
Indiana University because the insur- 
ance decision was decided upon by 
Purdue UniversKy, Later in the meet- 
ing, Chancellor Joanne Laniz stated 
that IPFW would have lo pay Ihe 
increase in insurance premiums, not 
the I.U. system, 

in the report by the presiding olficer, 
William Frederick, associate professor 
ol computer science, stated that Pur- 
due President Steven Beering will 
address the formal convocatbn of the 
faculty of IPFW on Doc. 10, 

Of the two bills that were passed, one 
dealt with membership on the Academ- 
ic Appeals subcommittee and the other 
dealt with membership ol the chief 
space allocation and planning officer to 
the University Resources Policy Com- 
mittee, The lirst bill was passed with at 
Iwo-thirds vole and the latler was 
unanimously passed. 



Anatomy professor says cadavers' use important and problem-free 



By Sarah A. Jakacky 
Stan WrHer 

Despite popular belief, Ihe cadavers stored on the third floor of 
Classroom Medical Building dont cause much trouble, said Joel 
Vilensky. gross anatomy instructor. 

The pre-med program requires a gross anatomy class, which 
includes the dissection of the human cadaver, Vilensky said that 
they are useful tools and helpful in leaching the making-up ol the 
human anatomy. He said Ihat they are also used when administer- 
ing exams. "The cadavers are leaching lools," he said. According 
to Vilensky. the llrst lime someone walks in lo dissect, "there may 
be a lillle trepidation, but medical students have to deal with it," 
Although the thought may cause a little apprehension, he said, "If 
Ihey cant handle it, they wouldn't be here." 

In his eleven years at IPFW, Vilensky said that he had never 
encountered a student who had a problem dealing with the cadav- 
ers because most know that now one would want a doctor who had 



no experience with Ihe human analomy. 

"They are going to have people dying on Ihem, so Ihey have lo 
get used to it. It's no dilferenl than a veterinarian who had lo dis- 
sect animals." 

The corpses, Vilensky explained, are anatomical gifts from Ihe 
deceased themselves. Everybody has been donated and they all 
volunteered prior to death. 

"Many of them are grateful to medical technology for one reason 
or another and want to give something back, and a majority of them 
are elderly," said Vilensky. 

In order for someone's body lo be donated, they must fill out forms 
prior to death. Besides saving on the cost of a luneral, he said thai 
Ihe donation helps in Ihe shortage of cadavers lor medical students. 

Vilensky said that about four cadavers are housed on the third 
lloor each year. Belore IPFW receives the bodies, they are shipped 
from Indianapolis lo the main medical campus where they are 
embalmed and prepared for anatomy classes. Then, Ihe cadavers 



are transported by a funeral home to various college campuses. 
Alter the cadavers are dissected, Ihey are sent back lo Indianapolis, 
where their remains are cremated. 

During the cadavers' visit at \?FW. they remain In the lab room. 
Vilensky said Ihat everyone is very carelul to treat them with 
respect and the sirici rules are imposed upon all gross analomy stu- 
dents. For instance, no material is allowed oui ol the lab rooms 
without written permission from a faculty member, and no one 
besides the medical staff, facutty and students are allowed inlo the 
laboratory without permlsston, 

Vilensky said that failure to follow Ihe explicit guidelines resuKs in 
severe disciplinary actions. However, he said Ihat he has never 
encountered a problem concerning these rules. "The students are 
really carelul not lo mistreat Ihem," 

Vilenksy stressed thai Ihere is no reason for any fear or uneasi- 
ness over Iho cadavers. They doni walk around and they dont 
cause trouble.* he said.

Education 

Admissions requirements 
need to be updated 

For years now IPFW has had a less than desirable reputalion, Prolessors say 
the school is 'nol a real university." IPFW has even earned the nickname of "By- 
Pass High." Why has this stigma been attached to IPFW? Where did it all begin 
and is there any way lo eliminate it? II IPFW were to change its academic admis- 
sions policy lor incoming students, IPFW would no longer be viewed as an easy 
solution. 

Students consider IPFW as a saleguard. If they can't gel into any other col- 
leges, they can always go to IPFW, because H will let anybody in, right? The 
result of this attitude produces a campus where a large number of students are 
boking lor an easy ride, not an intelledually stimulating and challenging educa- 
tion. 

To understand why this is allowed to happen, (he admissions policy must be 
examined. The admissions requirements for students fresh out ol high school are 
based on several requirements. A minimum SAT score ol 800, a class rank with- 
in the lop 50 percent, and a high school curriculum that includes four years of 
English, Iwo years of math and one year of science are the basic requiremenls 
1hat IPFW looks lor in new students. These requirements are essentially the 
same lor all ot the stale universties in Indiana. 

Bui according to Lila Hammer. Oflice of Admissions, if a sludenl does not fuHiil 
Ihe basic requirements, they can still be admitted within two categories. 

"Wa tend to give more leeway to students from our area," she said. II a student 
just misses lullilling the requirements, Ihe student is admitted on a probationary 
basis. If a student lacks Iwo or three of tho requirements or is extremely low in 
one, then IPFW will allow the sludenl lo be admitted into Ihe Guided Studies pro- 
Guided Studies limits the number of credit hours a student can take per 
semester and su|:^lies the student with an academic counselor that the student ; 
can meet with on a regular basis. So basically IPFW does indeed allow jusl 
about anyone into iha school. 

Some may argue thai as a stale-funded university, IPFW must cater to the citi- 
zens in Ihe surrounding areas. If someone didn't leel il important enough to put 
forth enough effort to meet Ihe minimum requitemenls lo get into college, what 
makes anyone think thai the person will do more al the university level? There 
are smaller colleges, junior colleges and community colleges who address the 
specilic needs ol studenis who are nol yet ready lor a big university. 

Of course there is always a group that will fall between the cracks with strici 
guidelines and eveiyone deserves Itie right to an education, so alternatives must 
be provided. 

One allernalive lo Ihe present situation would be to ofter special sections in 
basic requiiemenis such as math, science and English for lirst-year students, who 
are admitted Ihrough Guided Studies. The present situation allows all studenis, 
regardless of the level ol admittance, to be intermingled into the same classes at 
the freshman level. This lowers ihe average of educational need in the class. 
The class is then taught at a lower level, which is unfair to those students who 
need a more advanced curriculum. 

A special section ol classes would allow Ihe students who were admitted into 
Guided Studies to learn Ihe basics tliat they might have missed or need tor what- 
ever reasons. The classes would not be remedial, they would simply be taught at 
a level more suitable for the Guided Studies studenis. 

People complain constantly about Ihe lack of students' educational ambitions. 
Maybe if we stopped letting anyone and everyone enter the University, we would 
have a student population that actually cared atiout the education it received. 

How can Ihe distinction be made between those students who simply don't care 
and are coming to IPFW because no one else will take Ihem and those students 
who failed to meei the requirements, lor whatever reasons, and sincerely want lo 
apply themselves at the university level? 

For students not meeting all ol the requirements, Ihe University should require 
Ihem lo submit an essay staling why Ihey want to attend IPFW and the goals Ihey 
wish to attain. The sludenl should than be questioned personally by a panel con- 
cerning their desire lo attend IPFW. This process would eliminate Ihe lackadaisi- 
cal-mindad student but would allow room lor studenis who doni meat all ot the 
requirements, yet are willing lo put fonh the necessary efforts. 

IPFW needs to take a closer look at Ihe studenis Ihat are being admitted. Stu- 
dents who see IPFW as a safely net to fall back on should not be allowed into the 

University. By arranging Ihe admissions process to eliminate those sludenls, the 

message would be sent out that IPFW is indeed a 'real university.*

Lehers To The Editor 



Student speaks out 

IPFW administration needs more concern 
for the customer on campus 



To the Editor: 

An open (alter to Chancellor Joanne 
Lantz: '/^ , 

Being a pan-time siutfent at IPI^, 1 
enjoy a privilege that riOl many share. 
Because of the support ol my family 
(my wila and two children) and my 
employer, I am able lo lurther my edu- 
cation by attending classes two nights 
a week. The competitive nature ol 
today's global business environment 
demands that each employee and insti- 
lulion seek lo improve every aspect of 
their respeclive operations. By laarn- 
ing new lools and concepts, I am able 
lo recognize my, and my company's, 
weaknesses and make Ihe changes 
necessary to nol only survive, bu! 
hopefully thrive and prosper. 

The emphasis on quality and Ihe 
locus on what Ihe customer truly wants 
has never been more critical to our 
success as a nation. The whole pro- 
cess of rapid change that has occurred 
in the last decade has bewildered and 
Irightanad many, but if America is to 
regain its position as Ihe number-one 
economic power in the world, we must 
all work together as a team lo change 
Ihe culture of our country lo meet Ihe 
demands ol a global society. This 
teamwork must include our instiluiions 
ol higher education for they are the 
training ground for America's next gen- 
eration ol leaders. 

A student's experience dealing with a 
large universily such as IPFW forms 
impressions about how an institution 
should treat its customers. Since stu- 
dents are the sole reason for the uni- 
versity's existence, they are ils cus- 
tomers. II Ihose experiences teach 
Ihat Ihe customers' wants and needs 
are not to be considered in any deci- 
sions aflecling Iha services provided, 
they will carry those lessons forward, 
using tham as a basis lot decisions 
they will make as leaders ol indusliy 
and government. Conversely, il those 
experiences teach Ihat Ihe locus ol an 



organization is lo provide the customer 
with what they want, when h is needed, 
again they will carry that lesson for- 
ward. 

In the two-plus semesters I have 
attended IPFW. I have been bewil- 
dered and dismayed by the lack o! 
locus on the customer. To cite a 
recent example, on Sept. 16 I was 
parked in the lirsi row ol spaces next to 
Ihe east side of Keltler Hall and was 
given a ticket by the campus police lor 
parking in Ihe A lol. Since the map 
handed out during registration clearly 
showed all the spaces on Ihat side ol 
the building lo be AB parking after 5 
p.m., and the ticket was written at 5:22 
p.m. I immediately wenl to the campus 
police deparlmenl to quasiion why I 
was given a tickei. As I explained this 
to Ihe officer behind the desk, ha said, 
'Like I tail everyone, dont pay attention 
to Ihe map, read the signsi With all the 
construction going on Ihe map isn't 
right." 

These statements were made in an 
insoleni and degrading lone of voice, 
and I musi admit I became incensed at 
the officer's insinuation that I should 
'somehow' know better. I then asked 
him why the maps were not changed 
before thay were handed out, and he 
said they didn't have time to change 
Ihem before the semester slaned, and 
besides it was expensive to have that 
done. As a professional working in 
industry as a quality manager, il I were 
to respond lo my cuslomers in this 
manner, they would find another 
source for Ihe products they need. 

Studying this situation and applying 
the tools availatile to me, I cama up 
with some questions, that answered 
properly, would have prevented the 
customer (me) from having a negative 
experience, Why couldnl notices have 
bean printed and attached lo the maps 
before handing Ihem out? Why were 
there no signs or notices posted al the 
table where the campus police handed 



oul Ihe permits? During registration 
why couldn't the officers working Ihe 
labies tall the students which areas of 
Ihe map are incorrect? Why couldn't a 
"warning lickel" be given on the first 
offense that explained why you cannot 
park in thai location? Why is it not 
posted in the campus buildings Ihat 
certain areas listed on Ihe map are 
incorrect? Why is there not a sign 
posted in the parking lot explaining the 
discrepancy betiveen the map and the 
lo! markers? 

By examining Ihis situation from a 
customer's perspective, I was per- 
plexed thinking that somehow I was 
responsible (or deciphering conllicting 
information given lo me by the Univer- 
sity and Ihen having to make the "right" 
decision. Naturally I appealed the tick- 
et expecting Ihe appeals commHtea to 
apply the same analysis I had. 

On Ihe appeal lorm submitted, I 
specitically stated, "Map passed out 
showing AB parking alter 5 p.m. shows 
area to be AB parking." I was told by 
the officer in charge that I would 
receive a noiice in Ihe mail telling me 
when the appeals board would meet 
and that I could show up in person to 
explain my case. Although I have 
thrown away Ihe notice sent to me by 
Ihe appeals board, I do remember thai 
the lime Ihe board was going to meet 
was at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. 

Again, looking at this Irom Iha cus- 
tomer's perspective I posed a question. 
Since the tickei was issued al 5:22 
p.m. it was most likely that I was 
atlending classes in the evening and 
working during Ihe day, so why was the 
review scheduled during normal work- 
ing hours? Knowing Ihal it was impos- 
sible lor me lo attend I maintained 
hope Ihat common sense and aware- 
ness ol the University's obligation to lis 
students would prevail. 

My hope was short lived as I was 
recently notified the tickei was upheld. 
Guile frankly I am frustrated and 



angered by the way Ihis situation has 
been handled, but more importantly I 
am saddened because I see it as an 
outward symptom ol a much more seri- 
ous problem: ihe University as an insti- 
lution has not recognized it is there lo 
serve the students, nol vice versa. 

As IPFW has sirived lo keep its cur- 
riculum on the cutting edge so as 10 
make the student more competitive, 
the attilude toward Ihe student and Ihe 
systems used to meet the needs of the 
student are lirmly rooted in the depy- 
ing soil of the pasi. If the University 
does not lake the initiative to charlge 
its own culture to one that is willing to 
serve its cuslomers and give them 
what they want, how can H expect the 
students to change America's culture to 
one that is more progressive and sen- 
sitive to Ihe needs ol the people they 
are serving? Unless IPFW undergoes 
a cultural change, it is destined to be a 
primary player in the demise ol the 
economic and cultural leadership ol the 
United Stales. 

Fortunalely there is hope for Ihe 
future of IPFw and the students it 
sen/es. Within Northeast Indiana there 
are many resources IPFW can tap that 
will show it how lo start on the path that 
leads to a deeper understanding of Its 
true mission. The local chapler ol the 
American Society of Qualily Control 
has many piofessionals who are at the 
(orefront ol lasting cultural change wUh- 
I'n their own organizations. There are 
professionals on the staff al IPFW who 
have Ihe commitment and desire to 
see Ihe University lake a leadership 
role in educating and servicing Ihe stu- 
dent. We are al a critical juncture in 
Ihe future of Ihe University, and by tak- 
ing the initiative, we can see the stan- 
dard by which all othar institutions are 
measured against. Lei's get started 
now. not only because it is necessary, 
but because it is the right thing to do.

By Mary Shrock 
Staff Writer 

Art (s a mystery that eludes many 
people. The mechanics, the inspiration 
and the talent that it requires baffle the 
inexperienced. There is a man who 
has spent his IHe creating art work and 
inspiring in others an appreciation and 
enjoyment ol the craft that seems so 
natural to him. This man teaches the 
beauty of art and inspires the love of it, 
This man is George McCullough. 

McCullough taught as an associate 
pfolessor ot art at IPI=W from 1976 to 
1989, and at the former Fori Wayne Art 
Institute from 1967 to 1976, He retired 
from IPFW as proiessor emeritus in 
1989. He maintains a studio in Fort 
Wayne. 

Some ol his paintings will be exhibit- 
ed in the Fine Atls Building from Nov, 
11 through Dec. 6. 

Born in Long Beach, Calif., in 1923. 
McCullough took, an early interest in art 
because his father was a painter, he 
said. 

After completing both his undergradu- 
ate and master's degrees at the Uni- 
versity of Iowa, McCullough participat- 
ed in a overseas exchange through a 
Fulbfight governmental grant to Haly's 
Belle Arti Academy in Florence. Next 
he went on to Academie de la Grande 
Chaumiere in France where he studied 
for nine months. 

McCullough traveled across the 
United Slates studying his craft, from 
New York to Montana to Altadina, 
Calil., and finally settled in Indiana. 

Along the way McCullough mel and 
married Henrietta, who is also a lover ol 
art who does weaving and quilts. 
McCullough said Henrietta's specialty 
is weaving portions ol literary works onto 
a quill; her lavorile is Shakespeare. 




McCullough said several artists have 
influenced him in his work; Paul 
Cezanne for his landscapes and Van 
Gogh for his brilliant colors. 

Landscapes are McCullough's signa- 
ture paintings and he portrays them 
with bold brush strokes. But painting 
Isn't his only medium, he also works 
with stained glass. 

His strengths, according to 
r^dcCu Hough, are his composition 
and his use ol primary colors, These 
are evident in such oil paintings ol 
McCullough's as "Bicycles.' 'Ofiental 
Garden," and his "Sell- Portrait.* 

McCullough has a number ol Portraits 
displayed in the Wrapp Gallery in 
Louisville, Ky., along side the work ol 
one of his former student's, David 
Krouse, 

'l learned how to approach the 
actual art of painting, which is direct. 
There's no messing around. He gets 
right dowrn to business," Krouso 



said of McCullough, 

Another student ol McCullough's, 
Tom Kelly, said, "It's not only knowl- 
edge that George teaches. It's enthu- 
siasm. There isn't a painter he doei 
know about— he's had a great influ- 
ence on me," 

Currently Kelly has a show in Elkharl. 
Ind., and he has painted his favorite 
teacher, George McCullough, playing 
cards. 

McCullough said he enjoyed teaching 
and is especially pleased when his stu- 
dents become successful. 'You never 
know when you're getting through, but 
to see a student who receives awards 
... that's why teaching is one ol the 
great rewards,* he said. 

Another friend and former student of 
McCullough's, John Gruse, said 
McCullough's main value is getting to 
know his students. "Everything he 
does is with an artistic spirit and his 
door is always open."

Chicago loves Byrne's 'Forest' 



By Susan J. Horlne 
Stalt Writer 

You know il's a thrilling night in 
Chicago whan David Byrne ol Talking 
Heads fame performs with the Chicago 
Symphony Orchestra on the same 
night thai Allen Ginsberg just happens 
to be lecturing only a few blocks away. 

So much cutting edge, so little time. 
Byrne was who I had come to see and 
Jl proved to be an unlorgettable 
evening. Saturday, Nov. 9, at Orches- 
tra Hall on Michigan Avenue. 

The Special Pops Concerl began 
with a delightful and intriguing set of 
pieces (or percussion ensemble, 
performed by James Ross and Patri- 
cia Dash of the Chicago Symphony 
and Douglas Waddell and Edward 
Harrison, frequent players with the 
symphony. 

The lirsl work was a savage. 
Hawaiian war dance. "Ku-Ka-llimoku" 
by Christopher Rouse. The (our musi- 
cians started the audience's heart 
pounding as they manipulated over 50 
diderent percussion instruments in 
flawless syncopatbn. 

The players then concentrated on 
the speed and coordination required (or 
"Implosion" by Mantle Hood, Played 
on two xylophones, a marimba and 
vibes, the piece is said to produce a 
sense of "inner pressure" within the 
musician. It certainly accelerated Iha 
mood and anticipation of the eclectic 
audience. 

Finally the percussionisls mastered 
"Bolero" by Richard Trythall. a piece 
that sensuously builds over a continu- 
ous, yet very giadual accelerando. It 
loft everyone hanging on the edge for 
David Byrne and the symphony's pre- 
sentation of "The Forest," Byrne's first 
complete symphonic composition. 
Some of this music was originally 
heard in "The Forost," a theater piece 
by Robert Wilson and David Byrne, 
directed by Wilson, It premiered at the 
Theater 6er Freien Volksbuhno, Berlin, 
in 1988. 

"The Forest" is abstractly based on 
the first part o( the Epic of Gilgamesh, 
a seventh-century Sumahan text. Gil- 
gamesh, part god. pari human, and his 
rival Enkidu, sent by the gods to kill 
him, discover they are unable to con- 
quer each other in a violent wrestling 
match. Now friends and allies, they set 
out lo conquer Humbaba, who guards 
3 forest o( sacred cedar. They suc- 
ceed, and alter further victories, kill a 
sacred bull that the god of heaven sen! 
to kill Gilgamesh. In revenge. Enkidu 



is taken ill and dies. Gilgamesh tries in 
vain for seven days and nights lo bring 
his friend back to life. Finally, he 
buries his friend, and dreading the 
power of death. Gilgamesh sets out to 
conquer the secret ot eternal lite. 

In (he program booi&lt;let. Byrne is 
noted as saying, "The music lor 'The 
Forest' is unlike anything I've ever done 
before. I wanted somehow to evoke 
the romantic feelings ol the period in 
which (he story has been re-set, the 
mid-eighieen hundreds I've tried to 
write music that draws a lot from the 
romantic composers of that period, I 
wanted to be able to sympathize with 
those who feel the romance of the (ac- 
tory-the beauty, the power and the 
possibilities ot the machines that would 
change the world." 

The individual movement litles-Ur. 
Kish. Dura Europus, Samara, Ninevah, 
Ava, Machu-Picchu, Tula Teotihuacan, 
Asuka-are all names of once great civ- 
ilizations now lost to us. Perhaps, 
relating again lo so much of civilization 
that has been lost and gained since the

Conductor David Allen Miller led the 
d6-member orchestra, eight-member 
chorus and Byrne through all 10 move- 
ments with Hair and precision Byrne's 
lirst haunting note o( yodehng in Ur. 
pierced through the crowd and sent 
waves ol excitement through every 
seat. 

The harmonious, staccato, vocal 
punctuations of the chorus throughout 
the program were glorious, although it 
needed more amplilication. The cho- 
rus was at the rear of the orchestra and 
was occasionally overshadowed, 
except lor Byrne. Only once, during 
Ava, did the high-pitched, bizarre 
music strain Byrne's voice. He sat 
down, coughed awhile and regrouped. 
He prepared lor Asuka, where Byrne's 
distant, distorted and slow-motion 
vocalizations took over. In this linal 
number, he linaMy brought a little 
"swing" into his movements. 

He had literally been sitting on his 
hands all evening restraining his natu- 
ral instinct to move and gyrate as he

sal His knees were bouncing a mile a 
minute, and he looked like a powder 
keg ready lo go oil. After all, he was 
appearing with the symphony and had 
to try to behave himself. 

Smiles washed over Byrne's lace 
throughout tlie performance as the 
orchestra brought his score to a very 
satisfying fruition. Especially notable 
was Machu-Picchu, a bizarre melody 
(hat swells and slides Irom note to 
note. 

Syne is currently taking the piece 
around as a visiting guest of orchestras 
and has just recently finislied recording

Heads disbanded. Yes. disbandedl

Opportunity to see him in concert, dont

Although no Talking Heads reunion 
IS planned at (his time, a retrospective 
bo)( set is duo out sometime in '92. It 
will feature quite a bit ot revamped and 
previously unreleased material.

Review 

Foster directs first 



By Tammy Rasnick 
News Editor 

Fred Tate (Adam Hann-Byrd) was 
never an ordinary child. He could 
read ai age one and write abstract 
poetry by age lour. AI age S9ven he 
can painl like Van Gogh, compose 
elaborate operas and jam on the 
piano wiih ihe best ol them. But his 
intelligence goes beyond ttiat ol an 
ordinary wh/z kid: he has a deep 
understanding that surpasses Ihat ol 
most aduHs. 

Fred has an ulcer Irom worrying 
about Ihe rain loresl, the ozone lay- 
er and even homelessness. The kid 
is definitely beyond his years. Just 
like the title of the movie indicates, 
he IS 'a little man.' Although Fred's 
capabilities would seem to afford 
him everything, he slill lacks the only 
thing he ever wanted; 'someone to 
eat lunch with.* 

Dode Tale (Jodie Foster). Fred's 
street-smart single mother, loves 
Fred dearly but seems to tack the 
ability to give Fred the intellectual 
stimulation he needs. She tries des- 
perately to treat him like a normal 
kid. but alter no one shows up lor 
his sevenlh birthday parly. Dede 
decides thai Fred needs moie than 
what she's been giving him. 

That's where Jane Grierson (Diane 
Wiesl) comes into the picture. As a 
renowned child psychiatrist and 
director ol a school (or gilled chil- 
dren, Jane provides Fred with Ihe 
stimulation he has been stan/ing lor. 
Fred enters into a world where his 
intellrgence is not somelhing lo hide, 
and lor the lirsl time in his lile, he 
feels accepted. 

Fred attends a college physics 
class in the summer white he lives 
with Jane, and it is here that he 
meets up v/ith Eddie, who is played 



by Harry Connick Jr. (Did you know 
he is an actor?) Eddie is Fred's first 
friend, and much to Jane's chagrin 
he teaches Fred the art ol pool and 
the meaning ol jazz. Although Fred 
has lound Iriends and is challenged 
by the school work, he still lacks the 
maternal comlorls (hat only Dede 
can create. In the end a balance is 
reached where Fred has Ihe love he 
needs along with the intellectual 
challenges. 

Fred's undeniable adorableness 
definitely created a story Ihat tugged 
at heart strings, but Ihe plot never 
delved deep enough into Fred's 
thoughts. I would have liked lo have 
seen more ol Fred's feelings. The 
storyline seemed to keep the audi- 
ence a1 a distance when we wanted 
to get closer. 

'Linle Man Tate" is Jodie Foster's 
debut into the world ol directing. She 
does a wonderful job in creating 
believable characters and capturing 
the variety ol emotions that the 
movie deals with. Imaginative 
scenes that simulated Fred's 
thoughts when he was considering a 
challenging question gave the movie 
a touch ol creative innovalion. 

In spite ol its lack ol emotional 
depth, Ihe movie painted a true-to- 
lile portrait ol a gilled child's lile, and 
although I have no clue about what 
it's like to be gilted, I found myself 
being very sympathetic toward Fred. 
"Little Man Tate" will not cause you 
to question the core of your being or 
provoke you to any impulsive action, 
but it will make you smile and 
maybe even make you think twice 
about Ihe eflects ol being extraordi- 
nary in an ordinary world, making it 
will be worth the TBS (Tired-Butt 
Syndrome). 



Unsportsmanlike comment 

lU Basketball commands huge cult of fans 



By Chad Hesting 
Fealures Editor 

Cheaney. Anderson, Bailey, Meeks, 
ahh ... they're going to be in the Final 
Four, lor certain. The sunsets will 
tiame crimson this winter, and by night- 
lall whole neighborhoods and subdivi- 
sions will glow television blue on I.U. 
nighls. 

You know Ihe ones sitting in front of 
all those tubes. Fort Wayne Hoosier 
fans are middle class, like you. with a 
lot ol rich professional I.U. grads 
included. They're your father, grandfa- 
ther, boyfriend, husband. They'll be in 
Iront ol the Hall of Fame game against 
UCLA on Friday, and won't notice you 
again until next April. 

'Vou doubt me? Consider this: if 
you're an I.U, fan, or in love with one. 
add up Ihe time Ihe two ol you spent 
discussing politics, religion, literature or 
each other last season. Now count up 
the time you and your beloved speni 
staring al Bobby Knight's shining lace. 

Thai's 32 games times three hours a 
game. Did you spend 96 hours dis- 
cussing the great questions of life? I 
don't think so. Hoosier basketball 
takes priority. 

Take the good doctor whose wife 
delivered their first child in March of 
1937. Days later. Ihe Hoosiers smote 
UNLV and Syracuse lor Ihe National 
Championship. 

Not jusl dumb luck, said the good 
doctor. So he begged his wife all 
through June to conceive another baby 
with him, to bring back-to-back champi- 
onship trophies to the Assembly Hall 
trophy case. 

The good doctor's wile doubted his 
knack lor snilfing out divine provi- 
dence, and refused him. When I.U got 
humiliated by the Richmond Spiders in 
the first round ol the 19BB tournament, 
he didn't speak to her again-unlil next 
June. 

I know of a Pine Valley advertising 
man that has an I.U. room in his house 



with four walls and a ceiling painted red 
(pardon me, crimson), Iramed news- 
pages proclaiming the '76. '81 and '87 
championships, and I.U, Irashcans. A 
Bobby Knight clock tells time through 
the shadows cast by an I.U. ceiling Ian. 
All to set Ihe tone lor watching basket- 
ball on the T.V. Two I.U, basketballs 
guard either side ol Ihe tube, while 
votive candles give proper lighting for 
game nighls. The ad man used to 
make visitors genuflect before a por- 
trait ol Scott May, but age has mel- 
lowed the man. 

My uncle Kenny and I haven! spo- 
ken lor years about anything at all. 
except I.U. basketball. 1 remember 
knocking over a collee cup onto his 
lap. and him yelling "Aarghl Thai col- 
lee's hoi. watch it. boyl" That was 
Bicentennial Day. '76. and it's been 
Bobby and the Ijoys ever since. 

All good Hoosier fans owe Ihem- 
selves a trip to Assembly Hall in 

Commentary 

Bloominglon at least once in their lile- 
time. They walk around ihe hall six or 
seven limes, stunned lo see Ihe TV 
artifice made real. 

Once inside, (no. Ihe hall ism under 
armed guard) they mass al Ihe huge 
glass Ifophy case. Some snap pic- 
tures, some gingerly touch Ihe glass in 
Iront of all the basketball gold. 

I met a man at the case two years 
ago. He was weeping disconsolately, 
banging his list on the glass before the 
'75 NCAA tournament Final Four 
plaque. When I turned him around, he 
shoved his lace inlo mine. 

"Why?" He grabbed my lapel and 
said. "Why'd Scott May have lo break 
his arm? We'd be gazing al a champi- 
onship bucket now, instead ol thai 
soulless ... " The same crew won the 
tille the next year, but the glass was 
hall empty lo him. I bought him a box 



ol popcorn and left him lo wallow. 

Players like Buckner play and 
depart, so Knight is the lixed star 
Hoosier devotees keep their eyes on. 
That's a pity, too, because the great 
unspoken truth about Knight is that he 
has Ihe heart ol ... well, a Ihug. If 
there's a heart In him at all. QuH your 
yelling, you know it's Irue. Anyone who 
read three pages ol 'Season on Ihe 
Brink" knows it's true. 

The man has a plaque in his oflice 
that reads 'Success is like a woman; 
show her the back ol your head and 
she'll follow you anywhere.' 

"Bobby runs a clean programl" So 
goes Hoosier fans' slock answer to 
Knight critics. The fact is that Knight 
isnl so interested in a halo as he is m 
beating people wKh it. 

The list of money fenders he's 
lashed in the temple ts long and illustri- 
ous: Lou Henson. Wayne Duke, Dale 
Brown, Doctor Tom Davis, John 
Thompson, Bill Frieder, Eddie Sutton. 
Jerry Tarkanian, and Denny Grum. 
Shorties who aren't writlen down in 
Bobby's book ol the righteous gel his 
wrath. It's 3 mighty short book, loo. 

Even Bloominglon students gel 
dissed. In his annual tree lecture lo the 
students. Knight was asked how he lelt 
about a mandatory drug testing policy 
lor NCAA athletes. 

II it was up to me, he drawled. "I'd 
drug-test everyone ol you sons-ol- 
bitches.' We sons-ol-bitchas stood 
up and applauded him for two minutes 
solid. 

I don't think Knight and the Hoosiers 
have many lans in the black communi- 
ty. Black athletes don't mind playing 
for a man with three NCAA champi- 
onships under his belt, bul black lans 
look at Ihe unanimously pale coaching 
slall on Knight's bench, and go looking 
for Jordan on Sports Channel. Know a 
man by the company he keeps, 

I walked to Resen/oir Park lo talk lo 
some kids aboul the Hoosiers last

Lady 'dons split road matches 



By Lisa Howard 
Staff Writer 

The IPFW women's volleyball team 
spirt a pair ol malches lo conclude reg- 
ular season aclion lor 1991. Both 
matches were on the road and lell the 
Lady 'Dons with a 22-1 1 overall record. 

IPRAf traveled to Huntington College 
on Tuesday, Nov, 5. Huntington 
pushed the Lady 'Dons through five 
tight matches. IPFW prevailed wilh 
scores o( 15-12, 15-12, 12-15. 13-15, 
15-6, in spite of committing a season- 
high 39 attack errors. 

StatisHcally, the Lady 'Dons were led 
by Julie Kuber, a junior outside hitler 
from Wayne High School. Huber tallied 
IB kills and 18 defensive digs. Junior 
Bonnie Cannoll conliibuted 17 kills 
while Wendy VanderWilt. a senior right
