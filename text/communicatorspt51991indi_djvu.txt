tained two inaccuracies. The 
changes in curriculum will be 
for biotogy majors only; and Ihe 
plans (or a new building to hold 
the biology and chemistry 
departmenis ware initiated by 
administration members at both 
the IPFW and Purdue. West 
Lalayelte campuses. 



Eve(7one else calls him Larry. 

Regardless ol how he's addressed, 
Laurence L. Lile, associate prolessor 
of theater, continues la do what he 
does best: bring Ihoughl-provoking. 
evocative productions to the slage of 
Purdue-Indiana Theater. He's been 
doing ihis (or 21 years and for 150 pro- 
duciions-and shows no sign of stop- 
ping. 

Life's most recent endeavor. Oscar 
Wilde's "The Importance ol Being 
Earnesl,* raised a lew brows because 
of the director's gender reversal of Ihe 
entire cast. During a recenl inlen/tew. 
Lile said Ihis was unintenlional and 
was the result ol non-Iradilionai, color- 
blind casting. The subsequent "gen- 
derblind' auditions were a firsl lor 
IPFW. 

However, the theatrical technique 
was used nol for shock valuS, but to 
open up the themes in Ihe play, to get 
In touch with playwright's message." 
Wilde's message included artificiatily, 
lies, truth and "bunburying-when we 
have to lie to be who we certainly are,' 
clarified Lile. He hoped to heighten this 
play about masks and hidden identi- 
ties. 

Bul Ihe produc1k)n was certainly not a 
drag show or burlesque. Lile pointed 
oul thai men have been playing female 
theatrical roles since Greek drama, not 
to menlion Ihe role reversals done by 
Sid Caesar and, more recently, Dustin 
Hoffman in "Tootsie." Al limes, ol 
course, Ihe technique was used for 
comic value and cleverness. 

Life referred to another production 
currently using such non-lraditional 
casting. Texas producer Donald Shea 
has engaged celebrity lawyer Raoul 
Felder in his battle lo obtain licensing 
rights to Cole Porler's 'Anything Goes," 
However, Tams Witmark (Ihe agency 
responsible for the license) refuses to 
grant Ihe rights due lo Shea's use of a 




man for the role of Reno Sweeny, a 
part made famous by Ethel Mermam. 
The character Is nol played drag, but 
as a man. 

Life also said Linda Hunt played a 
man in the '70s film "The Year ol Living 
Dangerously." Lile claimed that many 
people didn'l' realize the pari was 
played by a woman. 

The PIT director then grew more seri- 
ous as he explained thai he doesn't do 
anything for shock value, but rather 
because he thinks it is impodant or 
necessary to the production. And he 
never does nudily for nudity's sake. 
Said Lile, 'I didn'l do "Great White 
Hope* for bigotry's sake, and I don't 

warn 10 do plays about gay people just Tsrrence Doran (left) and James D. Smead discuss Ing. A reception was held oh campus prior to Ihe show- 
to exploit gay people. The play must their documonlary on the aflects of poverty and hunger Ing of the 20-mlnule videotaped program (photo by Tina 
say something, something Important on northeastern Indiana at Tuesday's premier screen- Holston). 
for society lo know." 

Lile thought it was important for soci- 
ely lo know about Ihe matriarchal Vic- 
torian era referred lo in Wilde's play. 
He referred lo the male characters as 
effete snobs, especially Algernon, and 
said Ihe women were a social-man- 
nered lacade. The woman towered 
over Ihe men, and genderblind casting 
heightened that. He explained thai 
Oscar Wilde was concerned with 
masks because the playwright was 
forced lo wear them due to his homo- 
sexuality. 



New sociology chair plans updated department 



Indeed. Life explained his philosophy 
ol Iheater very simply: The Ihealer is 
Ihe best way to teach people about the 
seeds Of hatred and what that can lead 
lo. II theater isn'i saying something to 
society about the nature of our exis- 
tence, then I don'l really think it has 
much value." 

While Life has just started lo use gen- 
derblind casting, he predicted he would 
use It more frequently in the future. 
"Thai will probably upset a lot ot peo- 
ple. Thai's OK." Then he grinned 
wickedly and added, "People don'l 
walk out of my show apathetically.' 



By Tina Holston 
Editor in Chief 

The department of sociology and 
anthropology has been appointed a 
new chairman, and with him comes 
ideas of change and expansion lor the 
future. Peter ladicola, an assistant pro- 
fessor, was named chairman as ot July 
1. 

ladicola, who has taught at IPFW 
since 1979 and acted as chairman 
from 1982 through 1964. has his sights 
set on adding a graduate degree in 
applied sociology to the depailmeni as 
well as an evaluation and revision ol 
the current undergraduate curriculum. 
"I was very much involved with devel- 
opment of Ihe current program, but we 
never got to do the line tuning," he 
said. 

Alter conducting a survey ot local 
employers, he was convinced there 
was a demand for a graduate program 
al IPFW, "We developed a prototype 
curriculum which was well received," 
he said. He has plans to include a 
"task force" of students, alumni, and 
potential employers in the project and 



hopes the changes will be in affect by 
fall semester 1994, 

In 1966 and 1987 ladicola was the 
assistant director o! the American 
Studies program at Warsaw University 
in Poland, ladicola worked with partici- 
pants from ton other countries on 
urban problems "as well as citiiens' 
movements to address ihose prob- 
lems." 

One ol his currant research projeds 
is lo study the affects ol plant closings 
on American workers: a projecl 
requested by International Harvester 
and the local UAW. He is also writing 
Iwo books, one on the sociology ol vio- 
lence in America and another on crime 
and community disorganization. 

ladicola was born and raised In Som- 
erset . MA, He earned his bachelor's 
degree al Si. John's University in New 
York City and his master's and doclor- 
ate from the University ol California al 
Riverside. 

ladicola is active in community edu- 
cation issues outside IPFW. He has 
published several articles on Issues ol 



equity in public education. He recently 
ran unsuccessfully lor a seat on the 
Fort Wayne Community School Board, 
raising issues ol inequity in the distribu- 
tion of educational resources in the 
district. He is a member ol Ihe Policy 
Council for Community Action of North- 
east Indiana, the Policy Council of the 
CANI Head Slart Program, and chair- 
man ol the Head Start Public Relations 
Committee, 

ladicola has been married lor nine 
years to Janet A, Nes, a social worker 
with Reeber and Associates, and a fac- 
ulty member here at IPFW also in the 
sociology deparlmeni. The ladlcolas 
have lour children, two boys and Iwo 
girls ages 3 through 7, 

Although ladicola is looking forward 
to contributing to the sociology depart- 
ment and IPFW as a whole, he isn't 
excited aboul the load ol paper work 
that he will have to do. After having 
done the job in Ihe past, he knows 
being a department chairman includes 
a heavy workload. "The administralivo 
work isn't exactly enjoyable, but il 
comas with the job." he said. 



Video documentary chronicles poverty and hunger in Indiana 



Miss Virginia. 65, has a portrait of 
Mother Teresa hanging on her wall. 
Just beside it, rosary beads dangle 
from a nail. Most ot her days are spent 
quietly gathering lood and distributing it 
to the hungry in hear neighborhood. 
But today she's sitting down, looking 
into a camera, and telling two docu- 
meniary makers about what she does, 
how she does it, and why. 

Later, in August, Terrence Doran, 
independent producer, and James D. 
Smead, IPFW assislant protessor ol 
communication, were holed up in the 
IPFW television studio control room. 
With 56. 20-minute videotapes, they 
were making a 60-minute program out 
ol more than 19 hours of lootage. 

Throughout most ol summer 1991, 
Doran and Smead conducted inter- 
views with area people whose lives are 
profoundly alfected by hunger and 
poverty. They traveled to northeastern 
Indiana's migrant worker camps near 
Bluffton and Geneva, lo Allen County's 
Riverhaven community, and 10 Fort 
Wayne's inner city. 

What they lound is distilled into a 60- 
minule documentary. "Voices of 
Hunger: l.OOO Points ol Night." The 
program was initially commissioned by 
Janet Satterlield. director of the Com- 
munity Harvest Food Bank. Since then, 
It gained a IHe of its own with support 
from Cable Access, Inc., College Cable 
Access Channel 6. IPFW, and the Indi- 
ana Arts Commission. 

The entire project irx;ludes three half- 
hour talk show on "Poverly," "Does the 
System Work?" and "Women's Views" 
in addition to the 60-minute documen- 
lary, "Voices o( Hunger* made its debut 
on Tuesday, Sept, 3. at 8 p.m. on Col- 
lege Cable Access Channel 6. A recep- 
tion was held belore hand in Walb 
Memorial Unbn. 



"The locus ol the documentary is on 
communities and how they come 
together to deal with these problems," 
Smead said. 

Doran added, "The issue of hunger 
branched out to embrace other issues, 
such as the American value system 
and how it perpetuates hunger and 
poverty " 

A political view may emerge in the 
work, but if il does, it will be in the voic- 
es ol Ihe poor themselves. Narration is 
next to nil. Doran and Smead con- 
sciously decided to keep the script 
sketchy and to leave out editorial voice- 
overs. There was no forced agenda 
going into production. 

"We wanted to try to give the people 
of various communities Ihe opportunity 
lo say what they wanted to say," said 
Smead. 

"The point is to give voice to the 
voiceless," Doran said. "These people 
are rarely asked their opinion on any- 
thing." 

Miss Virginia has lived in a n impover- 
ished neighborhood near Hanna and 
Lewis streets for 30 years. She is not 
afliltated with any social service agen- 
cy. She does not get grant money. She 
simply relies on food donations from 
people who want only to help, not to 
find a tax deduction. The extreme 
close-up on her humble, earnest face 
on the screen is compelling. 

She's asked what she thinks of the 
church's role in combating hunger. 
Without lashing out. she replies with 
clarity and brevity: 'Some churches are 
the greatest help to me. The members 
just pull up m their cars with grocery 
sacks lull of lood." 

And the others? Have they 
tosi sighl ot the church's role in helping 
the poor? 



"I don'l know." she says, "They're 
beginning to come back around to it. 
though. I know of priests who sold their 
mansions to be used as apartments lor 
those who needed them, and who went 
to live among the people they serve." 

Elsewhere in the video. Smead and 
Doran introduce us to Alberta Williams, 
an inner-city woman who goes by the 
name "Queen," who routinely visits the 
Saint Mary's Soup Kitchen; Austin 
Winchester, a 90-year-old opinionated 
Riverhaven resident, whose letters to 
the editors ol the Fort Wayne Newspa- 
pers fill a scrapbook; and the Gonzales 
family, migrant workers from the valley 
outside Brownsville, Tx. They talked to 
Alfreda Bledsoe, who runs the 'Revela- 
tion Mission" out of a house on Frances 
Street. Now she's in danger ol losing 
that house. 

"We want to generate an awareness 
of these problems and the value sys- 
tem ol this country,' Doran said. 

Smead concurred. "These people are 
often seen as pitiful, lazy, undesirable. 
But the problems in our country have 
helped create some ot this poverty; you 
can attnbule much of it lo racism, sex- 
ism, or ageism, for example." 

They spent about three days in River- 
haven, a community east of Fort 
Wayne composed mostly of migrants 
from Tennessee and Kentucky, who 
originally moved here to work in facto- 
ries. Many of the residents still cling to 
that heritage. 

'You know how some communities 
fight over which one is going to claim a 
neighborhood? Well. Fori Wayne and 
New Haven fought over who wasn't 
going to get Riverhaven, and New 
Haven lost." Smead said. 

TTie director ol Riverhaven's commu- 
nity canter said the people wouldnl talk 
to us, bul we lound Iwo who did." 



Doran said. "We certainly sensed some 
hostility. The second time we went 
back I was shooting oul the car window 
and the stares were so hostile that I 
had to put the camera away,' 

By far Ihe most friendly people were, 
interestingly, the migrant workers. 
Once Smead and Doran made rl past 
the suspicious supervisors, the people 
were willing to talk. 

"They were friendly-smiling an laugh- 
ing. They're fairly content with their 
lifestyle; these are whole families with 
children working together," Smead 
said. "One guy was wearing an IPFW 
T-shirt! We tried to explain that was 
where we were Irom. but he didn'l 
understand. He spoke no English, 

'In the field south of Bluffton. Smead 
and Doran had gained entry by talking 
with a Mexican supervisor. When the 
"big boss* of Ihe operation arrived, he 
was visibly steamed to see all of the 
video equipment 

"He had just turned down a crew Irom 
Channel 15 (the local CBS-affiliate) a 
week earlier and suddenly saw people 
with video equipment. He calmed down 
when we explained we weren't with the 
news media." Smead said. 

"And besides, we already had the 
tape.' Doran added. 

Overall, the two are pleased wUh Ihe 
interviews they gathered. Sometimes. 



they were at the mercy ot Ihe social 
dynamic or had to change lacks. At 
Saint Mary's Soup Kitchen, for exam- 
ple, they had more people willing to lallc 
on camera when it wasn't crowded. 
Another day. Rich Garrett, and IPFW 
senior majoring tn radio and TV, 
manned Ihe camera while Doran 
approached people on Ihe sidewalk as 
they emerged. 

"I think we got a good sense of what's 
going on," Smead said. 'Intellectually, 
we have a good idea o' how society is 
functioning relative to these problems. 
As far as these communities are con- 
cerned, though, we've only scratched 
the surface," 

The two hope to market Ihe docu- 
mentary to several PBS programs, 
including "P.O.V,," The Ninelies,' and 
"Deep Dish." 

What do they hope the program will 
accomplish? 

'It should create an awareness," said 
Smead, 'when you've been creating art 
for as many years as Terry and I have, 
you locus on the quality ol the prod- 
ucts. You hope it will gel a v/ider distri- 
bution, and at the same lime, don't 
knowif it v;ill.' 

Doran said. 'I never feel satisfied but 
if I've don something I'm proud of. I 
realizelhal the uHimale Impact is out of . 
my control."

Commuter campus 
offers perks 

After youVe made your fourth pass around the B lot in a 
lutile search for a parking spot, remember thai you came to 
IPFW for good, sound reasons. 

Commuter campuses can be uninspiring. Travel to lUSB, 
Wisconsin-Green Bay, Saginaw Valley State, Wayne State, 
and the hyphens blur with thie memories of limestone build- 
ings. IPFW distinguishes itself in many ways and places. 

The first attraction for most students is the affordability of 
IPFW. While the fees tor dormitories at a large campus 
school are high, risking the hidden costs of off-campus resi- 
dency is the only other option. Near to home, the living is 
cheaper. 

The IPFW financial aid staff is knowledgeable and effec- 
tive, far superior to the bursar's-and-back mazes at Ball State 
University and Indiana University, Bloomington. 

Class scheduling is geared toward the commuter, the bet- 
ter for the student to spend only one, two or three days on 
campus. 

The EduCare Center provides parents seeking an educa- 
tion with quality, well-supen/ised child care. 

IPFW has proven itself to be committed to the establish- 
ment of new. innovative curricula: witness the Labor Studies 
and Peace Studies programs. Students can speak to profes- 
sors and associates as opposed to being "assigned" to a 
teaching assistant. 

IPFW has ariiple research resources as well. The Helmke 
Library's intra-library loan program is a deep well for materi- 
■als, while its computerized on-line cataloging system is faster 
than rifling through a hundred subject cards. The computer 
labs, curriculum lab. and library units provide p.c. use for all 
students, usually without a wait. 

The campus' setting by the river, thankfully, provides 
enough green to keep the by-pass strip malls at a distance. 
Also, you can actually sit down by the river, perfect solace for 
a student wound up by exams. Smart landscaping brings 
green among sidewalks, limestone and bricks. Credit the 
grounds crew for hard work in keeping it all alive and free 
from damage. 

Student life can thrive here. IPf^ supports an active ath- 
letic board. The men's volleyball team made it to the NCAA 
tournament's final four (try to remember the last Purdue team 
to do that). Access to the Athletic Center's facilities is free. 

Purdue-Indiana Theater has been staging fine productions 
for over twenty years. College Access Channel 6 has 
achieved a remarkable level of quality down in Helmke 
Library's basement. 

As you can see, there is much to do and learn on the 
IPFW campus. Only you can decide whether or not you 
have the energy to pursue these opportunities. Think about 
ll.

Lehers To The Editor 



Returning adult students are not a minority 



Well, we made Jl through Ihe first 
week of schooll While walking from 
Ihe brand-new parking garage to !he 
Classroom Medical Building (why does 
my class meet here?), a voice in my 
head said. "What in the world am I 
doing? I'm never going to make it." 

How many years has it been since 
you visiled d a classroom? No, parent- 
teacher conferences dont count. For 
whatever reasons each ol us have, 
we're backM 

On the one hand, leluining to school 
is exciling. On Ihe otfier, it's lerrifying. 
For most adult students (age 25 and 
older}, reluming lo school is a big slep. 
We're here to enter a new career, 
advance in our curienl one or just add 
to our tepertoife of skills. We are tak- 
ing a positive step in Ihe difeclion ol 
our goal. We have the guts to gel back 
in the trenches. 

Also common lo all ol us are the terri- 
fying elements ol returning lo school. 



"I paid my tuition. What do yo mean I 
have to spend $60 on books? It's 
incredible how expensive a book can 
be." 

Or, "Whal am I going to do with my 
kids while I'm in class. I don't spend 
enough time with ihem now," 

I heard one person lament while wah- 
ing in line for our new studenl-identifi- 
cation card. 'My boss expects me to 
work overtime until the, first of the year, 
and my professor expects a 30-page 
research paper by Dec. 1, Maybe I'll 
see my wife and kids sometime in Jan- 
uary?" 

'My life is already stressful enough. 
How am I going lo manage classes 
and homework in my schedule 
besides?" Do any ol these commenis 
sound lamiliarto you? 

Did you know that 45 percent of Ihe 
student body at IPFW is returning 
aduHs? The average age ol a student 



at IPFW is 27 years old. Plus, women 
make up 55 percent ol the enlire slu- 
denl body, ll looks like we are not as 
much minority as we thoughl. Jusl 
look around, many ol us can identify 
with returning lo school and making it 
all work. 

Well. I am here lo help make your Ida 
easier, it I can. In Ihe following weeks, 
I will be describing many o( the special 
programs and functions IPFW has set 



up specilically for reluming adults 
through Ihe Center for Women and 
Returning Adults. I will be looking at 
issues like linanciai aid, child care, 
returning lo Ihe woik (otce. lime man- 
agement and stress management. I 
think you will lind Ihat the/e may be a 
way lo survive and succeed lo al least 
reduce the stress o( trying. Congralu- 
lations on taking Ihe big step toward .. 
whatever. ,.,,, 



Prisoner seeks pals 



My name is Timothy Johnson, j am 
presently incarcerated at Ihe Westvilie 
Correclional Center, located in Indiana. 

Although you do not know me, I hope 
Ihal you will assist my by publishing

my situation (prison), I am unable to

The reason in which I am writing Ihis 
letter, is to Iry and receive friendships 



Bush proclaims crime awareness week 



II our Nation's schools are to be 
marked by excellence, they must otter 
students and teachers an environment 
Ihat IS conducive to learning. Accord- 
ingly, AMERICA 2000, our strategy to 
reinvigorate the nation's educational 
system, calls for every school in the 
country to be sale, disciplined, and Itee 
ol drugs and violence. 

Surveys indicate that as much as 80 
percenl of all crimes committed at our 
nation's institutions ol higher leaining 
are perpetrated by students, against 
students. The vast majority of these 
crimes are related to alcohol or drugs. 
Regardless ot its source or nalure, 
however, campus crime not only indicts 
costly material losses but also causes 
unlold personal sufleiing. Moreover, 
campus crime disrupts Ihe vital lunc- 
lions of colleges and universities, here- 
by depriving students of an optimal 
educational experience. 

Stopping theft, vandalism, sexual 
assault and other crimes on campus 
will require the sustained cooperation 
ot students, administrators and slall, as 
well as campus security personnel and 



law entorcement olficials. Every aca- 
demic community in America must 
increase its awareness of campus 
crime and ways to prevent it. 

Last year. Ihe Congress passed Ihe 
"Student Right-to-Know and Campus 
Security Act," which request colleges 
and universities to inlorm students and 
employees about campus crime statis- 
tics and campus security policies. By 
working together lo achieve the goals 
set lorth in this legislation, we will not 
only promote the salety ot those who 
study and work at our Nation's institu- 
tions of higher learning but also provide 
our student with a valuable lesson in 
civic responsibility, 

NOW, THEREFORE, I GEORGE 
BUSH, President ol the United Stales 
ol America, by vinue of the authority 
vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws ol the United Stales, do heretiy 
proclaim the week beginning Sept. 1, 
1991, as National Campus Crime and 
Security Awareness Week. I encour- 
age al! Americans to observe Ihis week 
with appropriate programs and activi- 
ties. 



IN WITNESS WHEREOF, 1 have 
hereunto set my hand Ihis twenty-sec- 
ond day ol August, in the year ol our 
Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-one, 
and of the Independence of the United 
States ol America the two hundred and

assistance with my endeavors to corre- 
spond with persons who would have

Commercial Success 
for Mete I Ilea 



A Review 
By Chad Hesling 
FealufOS Edrtor 
Ai lasl, Metalltca is gelling what they 
deserve. In lis lifst week ol release, 
Iheir new record. Metallica, sold two 
million copies, ensuring a debut al 
number one on the Billboard album 
Chan. Meiallica's success is the Iruil ol 
ten years' worth ol llreless louring, 
superb records and continued honing 
ol the lour players' talents. 

The band's history has led slowly 
but surely to this point. Their lirsl 
record, Kill 'Em All. Is a rock landmark. 
AI a time when aging seventies heavy 
metal acts were drained ol ideas and 
adrenalin, Melallica entered the scene 
with enough energy to propel heavy 
metal ttirough the eighties and beyond. 
Kill 'Em All welded expansive rills to 
the quick tempos ol Calilornia hardcore 
acts, creating the music called speed 
metal. Their 1984 follow-up. Ride the 
Lightning, was even more sophisticat- 
ed. The songs were longer, giving 
Metallica room to show oil both James 
Hellield's poweilul solos and the 
shout-along choruses. 

Then came 19fl9's And Justice For 
All. The songs now clocked in at 10 
minutes long. The lengthier cuts had a 
broken quality to them, full ol shorter 
rills and lime changes. The jagged- 
edged music better rellecled the lyrics, 
but some ol the songs were poorly 
conceived and simply wandered all 
over the map. 

No such problems on Melallica, 
■hough. The songs are shorter and 
more tunelul. Producer Bob Hock has 
beeled up their sound, too, making it 
easier lo shake your hips or - yes. 
bang your head, to. 

"Enter Sandman" starts Metallica oft 
with a joK. Lyrically, the song is the 
dark side ol Queensryche's -Silent 
Lucidity.' In "Lucidity,* a child's night- 
mares are quelled with a "HushC and a 
dose ol motherly love, but Meldllica 
tells us thai there comes a lime when 
sympathy no longer works. "Tfl/e're oft 
lo Never-Never Land,' says "Sand- 
man's' parent to the child. "Never 
mind that noise you heard/ It's just the 
"beasts under your bed/ In your closet, 
in your head.' Writer Hetlleld equates 



the beginning ol adolescence nol with 
the sprouting ol chest hairs, but the 
lime when a child's nightmares come 
too Irequently to be Ignored. 

Two more hard rockers follow, then 
•The Unforgiven* slows Iho pace, 
■Unforgiven' is a Metallica ballad. The 
very notion ol such a Ihing may make 
old-time Metallikalz squirm, but this is 
a powerful piece ol music. The "Untor- 
given* ol the title Is the lamily of a sui- 
cidal man The suicide lakes stock ol 
his lile. decides that he's worked hard 
and produced without recognition or 
identity, Ihen ends it all so that others 
will have to count the cost too. Acous- 
tic-guitar tones bring across the lyric's 
resignation. Hetdeld drives the point 
home, though, by cleaving the song in 
Iwo with a shrieking solo. His guitar 
makes clear the revenge instinct that 
drives most suicides to iheir death. 
Potent stull. 

Three songs. 'Holier Than Thou,' 

"Through Ihe Never," and 'Slruggle 
Within.' provide the speed and lorce 
that was missing on Justice. These 
cuts are spurred on by Lars Uirlch's 
meaty drum beats, hammering the nail 
home. (Welcome back lo the 4/4 lime, 
Lars!) 

A review ol Metallica may be beside 
the point. Chances are you'll hear this 
tape soon, booming out ol some 
dude's Camaro on the by-pass. Go 
ahead and buy h, though, and lind oul 
lor yoursell: speed metal is the ultimate 
body music. You'll know il hallway 
through "Struggle Within" when the 
band slams the song into overdrive, 
Ihe gearshiit snaps oft in your hand, 
and you go careening around the 
room, whipping your hair in time. 

Ah, heavy metal — it's nol iusi lor kids 
anymore.

A night from hell 

Ten things I learned in Indy Strip clubs 



Thundiy.SeplembCT 5. li»l 



By Chad Hesling 
Feaiufes Ed nor 
I gol a phone call Irom my old Iriend, 
Bob From Carmel, Ihls summef. He 
was due to be madied in Iwo short 
weeks lo his liancee, Delia From 
Carmel. 

Bob Ffom Carmel planned lo throw a 
little bachelor party lor himsell the night 
before his vows were lo be made, and 
I, being a (liend ol his youth, was 
dially' invited. -Sure,' I said, "What 
would be on the evening's agenda?' 
Bob From Carmel shot back eagerly, 
"A nighl in a lew ol the local (on&lt; danc- 
ing eslabhshments.' 

A cold sweat broke on my upper lip. 
I was Ifapped. "Folk dancing establish 
menls" was Bob From Carmel's code 
words lor strip bars. You see, my man 
Bob and I were raised lo know belter 
Ihan Ihal, Our Churubusco upbringing 
taughl Ihat a leal man didn't slick dollar 
bills in a woman's panlies. 

Something happened to Bob From 
Carmel alter gradualion, Ihough, He 
attended an all-male college, gol a 
$40,000-a-veaf job wilh Eli Lilly, a sub- 
scrlplion lo Playboy, and joined Ihe 
Republican party. In other words. Bob 
From Carmel stopped dealing wilh feal 
human beings. 

Still, he had made the invilalion and 
I had accepted H. The deal was to go 
down the next Friday night, and I wont 
feeling, like Charlie Sheen in Platoon, 
that I had 'to leach others whal I 
know." Besides, I naivety thought The 
Communicalor would pay lor it. 

Bob Irom Carmel, his len-man Lilly 
crew, and I went to thfee lolk dancing 
establishments" lhat night. At these 
clubs I learned ten Ihings about men, 
money, women and sex. 

Al Brad's Gold Card Club I learned 
Things SI Ihrough fl3. 

Thing #1 ■ You're going to get ripped 
off. Brad's Gold Card Club is, as you 
have probably guessed, aimed al Ihe 
yuppie dollar. The Lilly crew gave oul 
plenty of Ihelr yuppie dollars belore 
they lalt. Five dollars lo get in Ihe 
door. 

We made our way to slage-side

eyes are lined, jaws slacked, drool 
rolling out one corner ol Iheir moulhs, 
and one hand clamped firmly on the 
crolch. Were Pee Wee Herman a Gold 
Card patron, he'd be a Iree man today. 

Thing fl3 - Strippers al Brad's Gold 
Card Club have an unusual Iringe-ben- 
elil package. Work one year at Ihe 
Gold Card Club, and breast enhance- 
ment surgery is on Brad. No kidding. 

From Brad's we look Bob From 
Carmel over lo the ingeniously named 
Babes. Ai Babes. I learned Things 114 
Ihrough B7. 

Thing #'^ - A dollar bill makes men 
and women do weird Ihings. The 
patron will hold a single dollar bill aloH 
lo get ■bulled. " He inserts the lin in Ihe 
stripper's G-slnng, ihen hold his lace 
up and closes his eyes. She lowers 
herself, shakes her chest in a deter- 
mined fashion, and her breasts slap his 
temples. The stripper pulls away, and 
he grins bealilically. He has been 
anolnled. 

Thing #5 - There's on© in every 
crowd. Aguy who feels as guilty about 
being (n a strip bar as you do. That 
nighl. we found each other. His name 
was Jared. and ha worked with Bob 
From Carmel. Jated had heard I was 
divorced, so I was the perfect guy to 
tell his marital woes to. "I'm nol sure 
my marriage could take it if I lold her I 
came to Babes lonighl," Jared staned 



and ratlled on lor a haH hour aboul his 
darling betrothed. Suddenly, he 
stopped and announced he was going 
tothe restroom. Upon his reiurn, Jared 
grinned al me wilh orange laeih and 
said, "I jusipuked." 

Jared was a small guy, so he was 
easy to lock in the tnjnk of Bob From 
Carmel's T-Bird. He slepi soundly 
there until Ihe ne*! morning. 

Thing fl6 - Whal lap dancing" is and 
why it makes Stephen Sims so mad. 
One ol Ihe Lilly crew produced S50, 
gaining us admission lo Ihe Babes VIP 
room. We were sealed in a circle ol 
chairs, and one ol Ihe strippers began 
lo grind over Bob From Carmel. A 60- 
year-old woman eyed us warily from 
her perch in Ihe corner, making sure 
we didn't paw Ihe employees ... exces- 
sively. That's what Ihe $50 buys ... I 
guess. 

Thing tt7 ■ They've seen your kind 
before. One time. Two limes. One 
million limes. And I was next. 
"Where did you get your laiioo?" 
The dancer looked shocked. She 
pointed to the butterlly inked on her 
lorearm, and told me her boyfriend 
bought it lor her lor their second 
anniversary, not wedding anniversary 
you understand, but jusl. ... She waved 
her hips distractedly in the air, com- 
pletely thrown oil, then our time was 
up. 

We rolled drunkenly down I-46S to 
Brad's Brass Flamingo on Indy's south- 
east side for our last stop and Iwo 
more Things. 

Thing «8 - Don'l luck wilh Ihe man- 
agemant. Unlike Brad's Gold Card 
Club. Brad's Brass Flamingo reaches 
lor the Bubba dollar. Country and 
western is the music o( choice. The 
smell ol hair mousse and fake Chanel

manager, (BradI At lasll) a cross

with a woman in a lace unilatd. My

InslanI Death. I drank a tot of $3 beers

was produced, and this lee got my man 
taken on slage, stripped to his Jockeys 
by three dancers, and humilialed in

his wedding. I remembered Bob from 
jusl the nighl before, rolling drunk on 
Ihe stage, a monsltous erection poking 
from his shorts, getting whipped with 
his own bell. Delia From Carmel knew 
it, yel was putting a ring on his linger
