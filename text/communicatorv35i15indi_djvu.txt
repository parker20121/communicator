From the Wire 

By The Indiana Daily Student (Indiana University) 



Don't change historic building 
name for political correctness 



(U-WIRE) BLOOMING- 
TON, Ind. - Vanderbilt Uni- 
versity in Nashville, Tenn., is 
embroiled in a tussle with the 
United Daughters of the Con- 
federacy over the name of a 
residence hall the group helped 
build. Vanderbilt wants to 
change the name because of the 
campus' increasingly diverse 
student body. The UDC wants 
to maintain the name because 
it believes a 1930s contract en- 
tities the group to demand the 



of documents are un- 
signed. In 2003, a lower court 
ruled that the University could 
remove the name, but the word 
is still etched in stone above 
the building. The issue now, it 
seems, is actually removing it. 

The point is not that pro- 
name-change groups are trying 
to rewrite history or devalue 



federate i 

The UDC wants to keep 
it as it is because the dorm was 
built as a memorial to Southern 



It's about a contract," Jennie Jo 
Hardison, a UDC member, told 
The Associated Press Ian. 6. 

We're not buying it. 

Apparendy, neitherarethe 

"You're arguing social 
values and making the courts 
be the tough guy," Judge Wil- 
liam Cain told the AP, although 
a definite ruling is still pend- 
ing. There is skepticism about 
the legitimacy of the contracts 



signify racism, the Civil ' 
legitimize slavery. But to many 
people, that is exacdy what it 
brings to mind. The word has 
become a symbol of a shame- 
ful part of our history and gives 
it unnecessary weight. We'd 
like it if we could just take the 
world at face value, but in many 
cases, it's impossible to sepa- 
a symbol with its meaning. 






marginalizing history v 
action of altering the na 
body is forgetting tl 



that the women of the UDC i 
fighting for a pan of their heri- 
tage. That's an emotional issue. 
Vanderbilt is fighting what it 



sees as a shameful part of our 
country's history and the pain- 
ful racial heritage attached to 
it. Thafs an emotional issue, 
too. It would be supremely use- 
ful if both sides could detach 
from the ethos of the situation 
and acknowledge that logically, 
it makes sense to change the 
name. This isn't a fight worth 
fighting. 

On a lighter note, we see 
a golden opportunity for Van- 
derbilt. The university wants to 
simply remove the word "con- 
federate" from the dorm's name, 
leaving it "Memorial Hall.'' 

Hogwash. 

The University ought to 
use the fight as a fund-raising 
opportunity. Raffle the name 
rights off to the highest corpo- 
rate bidder, use the money for 
a fitness room and make it the 
coolest dorm on campus. OK, 
maybe Vanderbilt's too classy 



for that. If that's the c 



;, let a 
I organiza- 



ing rights, but if they choose 
this option, let them use the 
UDC mess as a learning oppor- 
tunity and contractually give all 
names a 50-year shelf life. 

But either way, we just 
can't advocate letting the "Con- 
federacy" stand.

'Napoleon' DVD not extensive, but enjoyable and accurate 



lar film is labeled by d 
as a "surprise hit." This past 
year was no exception with a 
low-budget indie about a dorky 
Idahoan that earned $46 mil- 
lion. Backed by a massive ad 
campaign and MTV's support, 



"Napoleon Dynamite" found a 
teenage audience drawn to the 
film's eccentric lead and favor- 
able word-of-mouth. 

Set in director/ co -writer 
Jared Hess's hometown, the film 
focuses on the daily life of the 
geeky Napoleon (Jon Heder). 

With his giant afro, uni- 
corn shins and moon boots, 
Napoleon embodies the awk- 
wardness that is high school of 
course, he's oblivious. Instead, 
he sets his disdain upon his 
equally tacky older brother, Kip 



(who spends his time "talking 
to hot babes online"), and visit- 
ing Uncle Rico (who's stuck in 
his high school glory days). 

ttially plot- 



manages to be hilarious. Rely- 
ing upon one-liners, Hess and 
his wife and co-writer, Jerusha, 
craft such an absurd environ- 
ment and memorable charac- 
ters that audienct

"sweet" and "what the flip?" Na- 
poleon is the perfect anti-hero,

The DVD's features, al- 
though not extensive, are en- 
joyable. The short film "Peluca." 
which "Napoleon Dynamite" 
is based on, was made while 
Hess was in college. The film 
depicts Seth (still played by 
Heder. but not yet Napoleon) 
in a condensed version of 
the feature with a cast com- 



prised almost entirely of local 
students including two charac- 
ters later combined to create 
Pedro, Napoleon's best friend. 

The commentary provid- 
ed by Hess, Heder and producer 
Jeremy Coon provides insight
