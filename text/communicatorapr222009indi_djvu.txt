Hana's Thoughts 

By HanaAI'Hawash 

liana.hawash@ipfvucommunicatDr.org 



Seeing Stars: Symbolism of Dreams 




In my dreams, all 1 see are stars an ex- 
plosion and gummy bears. What do you 
think? 
Dreamer, 

Though I am certainly not qualified for 
analyzing dreams, here is some of the in- 
formaEion 1 came across. A website, called 
http;// www.dreammoods.com, gave the 
following explanation for the presence of 
stars in your dreams. 

"To see stars in your dream, symbolize 
success, your aspirations and your high 
ideals. The stars indicate that you are put- 



ting some decision in the hands of fate 
and luck. Alternatively the stars may sig- 
nify your desire for fame and fortune. " 

This is pretty self-explanatory; here is 
what the site said about the explosions. 
"To see explosions in your dream, sym- 
bolizes your repressed anger. The rage 
that you have been holding in has come 
to the surface in a forceful and violent 
manner. Your unconscious is trying to get 
your attention, " 

When it came to the gummy bears, 
there really was no specific explanation. 



but here is what they said about regular 
bears. "To see a bear in your dream, sym- 
bolizes independence, the cycle of life. 
death and renewal. It may signal of period 
of introspection and thinking. The dream 
may also be a pun on "bare". Perhaps you 
need to bare your soul and let everything 
out into (he open." 

Now again, 1 am not a licensed psy- 
chologist, nor am I a psychic; this site also 
gives details on dream theorists such as 
Sigmund Freud and Carl lung, true psy- 
t hniiigL^ts of our history. With that, sweet

Profile in Leadership: State Senator David Long 

Fort Wayne native discusses ieadersliip roles, chalienges, pliilosopliies on life 



ByDanJehl 

D3nJehl@iphivcommunicalor.org 



Senator David Long is the third 
most powerful person in Indiana as the 
President ofthe Senate. He is from Fort 
Wayne, and a proven leader mlh a view 
of life all could use. 

From Monday to Thursday Uiis win- 
ter. Senator Long of District 16 lives in 
Indianapolis and works by day as the 
President ofthe Indiana Senate. On Fri- 
days, he's in Fort Wayne and working as 
the General Counsel for Pizza Hut Fort 
Wayne, a position he has had for over 
ten years. 

Long's office is at the Pizza Hut Fort 
Wayne offices on far-West Jefferson 



Boulevard. Since 1972, when Dick and 
Deena Freeland opened Fort Wayne's 
first Pizza Hut, the Freeland motto has 
been "Doing die Right Thing." That 
motto fits Mr. Long as well. 

Long was bom in California and 
graduated firom high school in Palo 
Alto. He attended Wabash College in 
Indiana for tivo years. His roommate 
had a sister named Melissa from Fort 
WajTie Elmhursi High School. Eventu- 
ally the two met, married and are rais- 
ing two children. Melissa Long in her 
own right is the evening news anchor 
for Indiana NewsCenter. 

Long's plunge into politics started 
by getting involved with Bud Meeks in 
the 1983 mayor's race Against Win Mo- 
ses, nowa state legislator himself Long 
then ran for Fort Wayne City Council 



and won in his first attempt. 

"I was just interested and was en- 
couraged to run," Long said, "I appre- 
ciate people and i try to return that ap- 
preciation." 

Long earned a Bachelor of Arts from 
the University of California at Davis 
and a Doctor of lurisprudence from 
the University of Santa Clara. Long 
has also served on the Fort Wayne Plan ■ 
Commission and the Urban Enterprise 
Zone Board. 

In 1996, Long ran for State Senate. 
He won and has been there since. 

Long explained the biggest chal- 
lenge he faces today. "(It's) the fear of 
failure and the entire matter of taking 
the plunge and jumping into the water 
and then learning to swim," Yet, fac- 
ing that challenge time and again has 



meant a successful career. 

Long's philosophy of life is that 
"nothing in life is achieved without 
taking a chance or taking a risk and 
despite talent, you won't find success 
without that." 

For four years, Long represented the 
Fort Wayne Cit&gt;' Council's 4th District, 
a position today held by Councilman 
Mitch Harper. 

What's the future for Mr. David 
Long? "1 have no aspirations beyond 
today, and I enjoy my life today." 

Long added: "When the day comes 
that 1 may lose my zip, then it's time to 
walk away And my goal is to do that be- 
fore the voters tell me to do so." 

And that won't come any time soon. 
Until it does, David Long will continue 
to lead. 



IPFW students participate in 
Day of Silence protests 



By Peter 
Schnellenberger 

Peter. Schnellenbeiger@ipfwcomniunrcalor.otg 



It seems that everywhere campus 
one looked on Friday, Apr. 17, there was 
someone with red duct tape or a ban- 
danna across their mouth with words 
like "fag" "dyke" and "gay" emblazoned 
across it. This display was to com- 
memorate The Day of Silence (DOS). 

These individuals were participat- 
ing in a silent protest, rallying against 
the abuses suffered by the LGBT (Les- 
bian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) 
communitj'. Together with their al- 
lies, the LGBT venerated all of die 
people who can "no longer speak". 

The silence was broken outside 
Walb Student Union, when United

'Tea Parties' attract large 

crowds nationwide 

Conservative protests labeled by some as 

new grassroots movement while others 

call them baseless and defamatory

On April 18, several hundred people 
congregated at the Allen County court- 
house to protest taxes and wascehjl 
spending. This event is not the first of 
its kind, asTea Party protests have been 
taking place all across the country in 
correlation vAth Tax Day, which was on 
April 15. Conservative political activist 
and author Alan Keyes gave a speech at 
the Fort Wayne protest. 

The front lawn of the courthouse 
overflowed with Fort Wayne's citizens. 
Signs of all sizes and colors were held 
high over the heads' of fathers, moth- 
ers, the young and the old. While they 
had all come together to protest a very 
touchy subject among Americans to- 
day, the emotions running through the 
crowd were not hostile. 

Media coverage of this national 
event had mostly cast protesters in a 
not-so-posilive light. Participants, and 
in many instances their young children, 
have been photographed in the past 
week at these raUies holding signs that 
compare President Obama to Karl Marx 
and Adolf Hitler. Some even had mes- 
sages condefnning socialism or claim- 
ing that the United States is becoming 
a socialist state, in general questioning 
the patriotism of elected officials. While 
supporters claim these events to be a 
legitimate grassroots movement, those 
opposed see these protests as simply 
baseless and defamatory and wonder 




why these people expect so many na- 
tional and global problems to be solved 
in less than 100 days. 

Although some messages dictated 
could have been somewhat offensive at 
the Fort Wayne rally, it was a surprise to 
see that there were very few posters or 
verbal communication used to direct- 
ly attack the president or liberals on a 
personal, superficial, or an absurdly 
derogatory level as witnessed through- 
out much of the country. Some state- 
ments could perhaps resonate well 
with others, while some were obscure 
or inaccurate. 

Regardless of political correctness, 
those in attendance had gathered to 
make their ideals known, whether they 
completely understood the implica- 
tions of their actions and ideas or not. 
The success of the protest may not 
have been from the message they were 
trying to send, but rather the fact that 
America still lives and thrives from its 
people. Citizens exercised their rights 
and freedoms to congregate and voice 
their opinions without fear of being 
chastised or silenced, which is perhaps 
the most important of ail American 
ideals.

Darkroom 

w/ Deas Veil &amp; Hope Arthur 

Local favorites display talents at The Grind 



Story &amp; Photos by Lucas Carter 

www. lucascancfpliDlogniphy.coin 






Last Thursday, Apr. 16, The Grind coffee shop hosted a concert of 
local favorites Darkroom, along with friends Deas Vail and Fort Wayne 
local Hope Arthur. 

Hope (pictured right), a sophomore Music/German major, opened 
up the night with a melodic blend of cleverly structured songs and a 
sound that could be achieved if Ben Folds and Regina Spektor hooked 
up. "It's hard to find good venues in Fort Wayne," says Arthur "but I 
really just want to get people to hear my music." The Grind has become 
a key place for local and touring bands to do just that. Darkroom had 
their equipment set up behind Hope's piano and w/asted no time filling 
the air with uplifting melodies and the occasional breakdown that rivals 
any of Coldplay's best songs. Darkroom is currently in the process of 
writing and recording for a new full-length album to be released this 
fall, according to Darkroom guitarist Kyle Steury (pictured top right). 
Lastly, Arkansas band Deas Vail finished off the night with an upbeat, 
energetic set with an almost happy-go-lucky attitude. Deas Vail is what 
anyone would expect out of a college indie-rock band, but the only dif- 
ference is they have the indte-rock feel down to a science. 

"They have a new album coming out around the same time as ours," 
Steury said. "I expea them to get big with this album. I really think it's 
going to blow up," 




Roommate's Pick 

Sing It Loud 



By Mark Cox 

mark.coiQipfwconununiutor.of9 



To change it up this week, 
I warned to be a little predict- 
able and highlight a pop punk 
band that has freshly entered 
the scene. Sing it Loud. Although 
they have their stereotypical pop 



punk sound, I feel that they are 
different in their sounds than 
others. Last year they produced 
and released theirSing it Loud EP 
as weU as Come Around, which 
was produced by Motion City 
Soundtrack guitarist. Josh Cain. 
They were offered a contract with 
Epitaph after only playing seven 
public shows together, which is 



an amazing feat in 
the music industry 
of bands trying to 
get signed. 

"So many pop 
bands are on pop 
record labels, but 
we're a pop band 
on the most ba- 
dass, punk-rock 
label ever. Tt lets us 
keep a more individual and orig- 
inal vibe because we're not asso- 
ciated with a bunch of bands on 
the same label that sound exactly 
like us," Kieren Smith said, the 
band's guitarist /vocalist. With 
the little bit of squeeze room of 
not becoming a cookie-cutter 
pop punk band, Sing it Loud has 



had opportunities to do what 
other bands haven't — have their 
own unique sound and the free- 
dom to experiment with their 
sound. 

Their second album has guest 
appearances of [ustin Pierre 
from Motion City Soundtrack 
and Alex Gaskarth from All Time 
Low. Come Around hit the 44th 
spot on the Billboard Heatseek- 
ers chat in 2008. A few of my 
favorites from them are No One 
Can Touch Us, about spend- 
ing the time with someone you 
love, and the acoustic version of 
Come Around which is its pohir 
opposite, about picking yourself 
after losing someone you love 
and moving on. 





Harmony of New IPFW 
Radio Creates Community 



By Kelly McLendon 

krllrjndMdone 
ipfwcommurkaiDraig 

Some ideas lake more time ihan others to happen. 
That's certainly the case for a new interactive radio 
program on campus called "IPFW Next Generation Ra- 
dio." 

"A couple years ago, people tried lo create a radio 
scene at IPFW, but it flopped, " Junior lillian Speece, the 
student mastermind behind the project, said. 

For the past few months, Speece has been working 
lo create a new radio program, which will be listed on 
the iTunes U (university) website. 

The program "will link the real world to the digital 
world with the hopes of creating a diverse college com- 
munity based around IPFW college musicians," 
said Speece. "U will suppon the musicianship of 
the IPFW students and it will create an aware- 
ness of the talented musicians on cam- 
pus," 

Many other universities utilize the 
digital music sharing scene including 
prestigious schools such as Carnegie 
MeUon Universit&gt;', Stanford, Harvard and 
Yale. They all have programs under the ilVines 
U category. For some schools, students can down- 
load course schedules, interviews, lectures, free 
language lessons, as well as community- orga- 
nized music on i'Rmes U. The Apple website calls 
it "mobile learning" and said, "learning no longer 
happens only at a desk. Students now expect constant 
access to information, noiQatter where they a^e." Since 
many students on campus have an iPhone or an iPod, 
the accessibility of iTunes IPI^ will be easy. Speece 
believes having die site ivill also foster a sense of unity 
and create community, 

"The aura of listening to die music is remarkably 
the most elite end goal of creating community thi 
a website," she said. 

Speece also said it's important to note that students 
and other people interested in the IPFW radio program 
should occasionally "step out of the digital world and 
watch the musicians perform at live events. This final 
goal presents the ultimate communal activity that can 
be a means from the digital world." 

having the songs of locals featured on the site, 



those who listen to the programs will be able to learn 
about area bands and maybe become interested in go- 
ing to see a live show in-tovm on a Friday or Saturday 
night- 

As a whole, the radio program "wiU be available 
for all people and the music will be free to download, 
along with all of the other free educational download- 
able information that site offers." she said. 

More information about this project can be viewed 
at www.ipfwradio.blogspot.com. The official launch 
date for the website vvww.i tunes.iphv.edu will be on 
April 29. If you would like to have your original music 
featured on the site, send an email to ipfvtrradio^'gmail.

Bl: Gottschall - 37 



Last Saturday, the IPt^ Mastodons 
were finally able to break an Il-game 
losing streak in an encounter with the 
Oakland Giizzlies. The first inning set 
the lone, as lead off man loel Washko 
smacked a double, followed by [ordan 
Kohler taking a pitch for the team. 
Topping off the inning with a Chris 
Gottschall home run made moral high. 
Fnding the first with three runs really 
sci the bar for the Mastodons for the 
rest of the game. 

in the third inning, the magic came 
(o life again as Gottschall hit another 
liammer over the left field fence. 
Gottschall ended the third inning with 
five RBI and a whopping total of six for 
the game. 

IPFW really sealed the deal in the 
eighth inning when both Gottschall 
and Mark Garden doubled and Jason 
Doerffler singled, each with an RBI a 
piece, leaving the final score 11-7. 

"Chris hit the ball well. As far as what 
to expect, the power and the homeruns 
that happened this weekend, probably 
not everj' weekend but we do expect 
him to continue to play well," head 
coach Bobby Pierce commented. 

In the second game, the Grizzlies 
jumped off the staner blocks a little 
faster than the Dons, scoring one in 
the first and two in the second. And 
they kept scoring until they topped out 
at seven. 



Gottschall once again hit it lucky 
in the bottom of the sixth, slamming 
another ball over the fence. This made 
his third for the day and seventh 
homerun on the season. The final game 
Saturday ended in a heartbreaker as the 
score board read 7-1. 

"My big thing is to keep it close so 
we can get into (the Summit League) 
lournament," Pierce said. 

Resuming action on Sunday, IPFW 
once again redeemed their fail. The 
game was played in the chilled misty 
weather, but the Mastodons still found 
their spark. Moving into the bottom 
of the ninth, down by one (2-31, a 
progression starting with the top of the 
lineup ended willi the bases loaded 
and Shaun VanDriessche up to bat. 

VanDriessche singled scoring 
Kohler and Washko, and the umpires 
called it a game, 4-3. 

"We aren't really happy with our 
record so far, but going to Centenary 
this weekend, we still have a chance 
at the teams we really need to gel, 
if we find a way to play well," Pierce 
finalized. 

The Mastodons started the series on 
Friday with a not so fortunate outcome. 
It was a close match up, but Oakland 
came out with the win, 7-6. 

After a weekend high batting 
average of .421, pounding a total of 
eight hits including three doubles, a 
triple and smashing three homeruns, 
Gottschall was recognized as player of 
the week by the Summit League for his 
performance. 



Soccer reaches draw with Valpo 
in spring supplement of festival 



By Dan Vance 



Forthefirsttime ever, the National SoccerFestiva! 
(formerly knoivn as IPFW's Soccer Showcase) held a 
spring portion with four games at the Hefner Soccer 
Complex this past Saturday 

IPFW competed in one of the early games of 
the day, ending in a tie with fellow Indiana school 
Valparaiso, 2-2. 

Cole Helmrich scored IPFW's first goal and the 
initial point of the game on a pass from freshman 
standout MaxToulette in the first half of play. 

The Crusader tied the game back up late in the 
first half when IPFW goaltender Josh Howell jumped 
to the edge of his box to stop an offensive rush from 
Valparaiso, but did not pay attention to a second 
player on the opposite side of the box. 

Next fall, the Mastodons will add sk players. 
Already signed are Brent Helton, Donovan Dowling, 
Oscar Narvaez and Fort Wayne natives Mitch 
Falkenstem (Snider). Grant Welter (Homestead) 
and goaltender Ryan Van Camp (Snider). 

The National Soccer Festival is the brain child of 
Hall of Fame former IPFW coach Terry Stefankiewicz 
and has expanded over the last nine years, now 
including the spring date. 

Division 1 soccer programs are only allowed 
to play other universities on five different days 
currently, all of which contribute to their spring 
record. 

Also during Saturday's spring version, Saint 
Francis topped Taylor University 3-1, national 
powerhouse Indiana beat Akron 2-0 and Michigan 
Slate also beat Loyola 2-0.

Summit League Tennis Championships 

■ School to host conference event this weekend; IPFW women and Oral Roberts men expected to take Summit League titles 



By Dan Vance 

da n.vaneeeipfwcommuni utor.org 



Heading into this weeltend's Summit League 
Tennis Tournament, the IPFW program lias firmly 
established ilself as one of the better programs in 
the conference. The men will be a four-seed while 
the women are the top overall seed on their side of 
tilings. 

The tournament will be played on the outdoor 
courts at IPFW, pending weather. They ivill start with 
first serve at 9 a.m. on Friday and continue through 
the day with championship matches on Saturday. 

"It's nice to be at home, to get friends and family 
and the student body out ther," tennis coach Eric 
Burns said while noting they haven't had tons of 
experience themselves this year on the outdoor 
courts due to weather. 

The women have been rolling through an 
undefeated Summit League schedule. As a whole, 
the 22-3 team has not lost since a 4-3 loss to Akron 
on March 8. Few matches have even been close 
during the spring schedule, especially in the Summit 
League. Their closest match in conference however, 
was a "1-3 victor&gt;' over Southern Utah, their semi-final 
opponents in the noon match on Friday 

But for Burns, coach of both the men and the 
women, it has been a long time coming to get to the 
point where the women are. Burns took over the 
program in 2002 and has built it from the ground up 
with varying degrees of help in the coaching realm. 

"It's been a nice ride," Burns said of his tenure so 
far at IPFW. "We have a lot of great girls contribute. 
We've had a lot of great girls contribute over the 
years." 

The women, in addition to their outstanding 
record in conference, out of conference and overall, 
also nabbed a regular season conference title and is 
the favorite on the women's side this weekend, where 
the team could capture IPFW's second Summit 
League title as a school.

"We've done a lot of good things," Bums said 
of the year, noting a school record for wins aiid the 
regular season Summit League title. Though he also 
said that anything short of a tournament title would 
be a little bit of a letdown. 

Burns noted that while he is focused on capturing 
the crown over the weekend, in the grand scale, the

big time if they ca 



regular season tide means just as much, if not more 
because of the consistency it takes to accomplish that 
honor. 

"Anjlhing can happen in a tournament situation- 

a team can get hot," Burns said. 

On the men's side, the tennis team will face off 
against top overall seed Oral Roberts. 

"We have a good matchup in the first round if you 
ask me," Burns said. 

The Mastodons fell 4-2 to the Golden Eagles on 
April 10, but played strong in number two, number 
three and number five singles, pusing Oral Roberts 
to the limit. What hurt the Mastodons most in that 
effort was not getting the point in doubles play. 

"We just need a good team effort across the board 
that day. You've got to get that doubles point or you 
have to play four strong matches (at singles)," Burns 
added. 

In that final Summit League cluster where they 
fell to Oral Roberts, the Mastodons played strong in 
topping lUPUI and Centenary to earn this fourth- 
seed. Had they played poorly in the cluster, they may 
have missed out on the tournament, which has just 
four spots from the seven schools who compete in 
mens tennis from the conference. 

The men's game with Oral Roberts will kick off 
the tournament this Friday at 9 a.m. with the IPFW 
women playing at noon. 

UMKC and Western Illinois' men will have the 
2:30 p.m. start time on Friday, followed by Western 
Illinois and Oral Roberts women acdon at 5:30 p.m. 
in the other semi-finals. 

Saturday ".vill be championship day with the men 
at 10 a.m. and the women following them at 1 p.m. 

Burns, now a veteran in the coaching ranks knows 
that above all, the teams need to stay focused, yet 
still loose if they plan on capturing the school's first 
Division 1 tennis crowns. 

"We are just going to keep doing what we have been 
doing," Burns said. "They are just tennis matches and 
we need to keep that in perspective."

Freshman making an impact 



■ Softball player taking 
game seriously, leading 
IPFW in midst of 14-18 
start to season 
By Monica Gerdeman 

moniu.gvrdemanSrpfwcommunicalDrorg 



It's always a plus when an 
athlete doesn't look at their sport 
as just a game, but as a lifestyle. 

That is how freshman Kaylee 
Faurote feels about softball here at 
IPFW. 

Faurote started her love for the 
game at the age of hve, but playing 
in a coaches pitch league, she said 
it was about the time she hit junior 
high that her love for the ganif 
really sianed to develop. By thf 
time high school came around, 
she knew she wanted to conimui.' 
playing at the collegiete level. 

"Playing at the college level has 
always been dream of mine, ' said 
Faurote. 

Faurote left her mark at 
Bellmont High School before she 
graduated. She set five school 
records in her senior year alone, 
including a .494 batting average, 
46 runs, 11 doubles and five 
triples. Scoring 46 runs not only 
broke a high school record, but 
also allowed her to rank second in 
the state of Indiana. 

"College is more competitive 
than high school because you 
have all the best high school 
girls playing against each other. 
It's much harder because the 
pitching's tough and in general 
the teams are tougher. My favorite 
part of the game is my team. We all 
bond really well," said Faurote. 

With freshman status, Faurote 
is fifth on the team with 21 hits for 
the season and fourth with nine 
RBI. 

Faurotehad many college offers 
before making her final decision,

time management skills to play 
sports with all the traveling time 
and practice." Faurote said. "You 
have to be very committed and 
if you think you may not be, you 
shouldn't play We put in a lot 
of hours on the Held because we 
have to be there about two hours 
before every game to practice and 
warm up. So on days with double 
headers, we are there all day," 
stressed Faurote. 

At the end of the day, Faurote 
is stiL very thankful to have her gift 
and her love for the game as she 
states. 

"To be an athlete you have to 
be very independent, but at the 
same time working well with your 
teammates is really important 



but when it came doivn to it, IPFW 
was the only bigger school offer 
that was the close to home. 

Faurote explained, "it's nice to, 
in a way, be tliere for our school. 
It's really an honor actually to be 
playing Division I softball. If I had 
to pick one person to consider a 
role model 1 would have to choose 
my dad. I feel if wasn't for him, I 
wouldn't be as far as I am, or even 
here at IPFW today" 

As most athletes know one of 
the biggest transitions ftom high 
school sports to playing at the 
college level is the time. IPFW 
softball practice will last anywhere 
ftom two and a half to three hours 
a day. 

"You have to have very good 



Mastodons dealing 
with injury bug 

Brandon Knowling &amp;Chad Nielsen 

IPFW's best pitcher firom 2008 will not be seeing 
the field anymore this season after just 2/3rds of an 
inning of work. Brandon Knowing, who was named 
in the presason to the Brook Wallace National 
Player of the Year Watch List, pitched less than 
an inning and will be undergoing season ending 
surgery to repair a shoulder injury suffered over 
the summer. 

Another Mastodon pitcher. Chad Nielsen 
underwent Tommy |ohn surgery recently to repair 
a torn UCL in his elbow. 

Both have applied for medical redshirts. 

Aaron Richie 

The soon to be senior mens basketball player 
suffered a stress fracture in his ankle several weeks 
ago and has missed some shooting workouts. He 
will however be able to put weight on it more in the 
coming weeks when he can stop wearing the boot 
that currently is on the injured leg.

Rugby Struggles with quick Purdue fc G&amp;MMUKlCAldR 



By Dan Vance 

dan.vanuOipfwconimunicator.oig 

The IPFW rugby club got away from the cold 
weather last Saturday as they hasted the Purdue 
Hoilermakers at McMillan Park on the south side of 
Fort Wayne. A final score was unavailable. 

"They were a really clean team and really 
professional. Even though they were winning by alol, 
they didn't try to put us down," said IPFW co-capiain 
Brandon Ringeisen. 

In contrast to the rest of their games so far this 
year, the weather was warm and sunny for Saturday's 
contest. 

"Rugby is actually easier to play when its chillier, 
when it's nice you can get dehydrated easier," 
Ringeisen noted. "Everybody played hard. I think we 
improved, got some new guys out there that showed 
some potential." 

The team will now travel to Muncie to play Ball 

State this Saturday. Instead of just the straight IPFW 

team that played Purdue, the group will team up ivith

Years later, Freedom still a unique brand 



In All Directions 

By Dan Vance 
vance-tad.blogspot.com 



Before last Saturday, it had been 
five years since I allended an indoor 
foolbail game. I guess I didn't realii^e 
how much I missed it. 

While the atmosphere of the 
Memorial Coliseum was lacking from 
the early days of the Freedom, where 
they were consistently making and 
breaking attendance records, the 
vibe of indoor football is still always 
unique. ■ ■ ~ 

Yes, in some 
areas, this seems 



like a watered 
down version 

of the original, _^ 

where we don't — ^-^^^^^^^^— 
even have our ovra field {that or we 
changed our name to the Louisville 
Fire). 

On the field, the Freedom were 
all about throwing the ball, with 
quarterbackRandy Hutchison throwing 
up 47 pass attempts, a new Continental 
Indoor Football League record. While 
not always successful, at least the 
Freedom were not shy on going for 
broke more often than not. 

NickBody, in his first game back ivith 
the Freedom, was strong in making big 
gains and had no problem being vocal 
with his defensive counterparts. 



Where the Freedom lacked in 
personality, the visiting Chicago 
Slaughter made up for in many ways. 

No, I'm not just talking about 
their seemingly out of the loop head 
coach, former Chicago Bear Steve 
McMichael, who must have been off 
daydreaming about his days as a World 
Championship Wrestling grappler. 
That's my best guess, since I saw him 
coach all of once- all game. 

Instead, it was cornerback 
Sidney Lewis who primarily kept me 
entertained throughout the evening. 
While his blatent. and repelative pass 

interference 

followed by "who 
me?' glances 
were worth a 
laugh or iwQ~ it 
was his 'thug 
— life' approach to 
referee relations 
I loved. 

When disagreeing with one referee 
call, l£wis turned to the referee to say 
"That's bulls---. Don't let me catch you 
on the streets." 

Classy. But what more can you ever 
really expect from a team called the 
Slaughter. 

I had no expectations going into the 
game and no, this is not the Freedom 
that I remember from the Antoine 
Taylor quarterbacked era. However, it 
is still a unique brand that is well worth 
a visit at least once. Especially if Sidney 
Leivis is in town. 



"Don't let me catch 
you on the streets."
