Education standards changing 

New teaching sections created 



In order lo follow the 
newly adopted lubonal standards 
for educators which were put in 
place by the Indiana 
Professional Standards BoanI, 
cducalion ma]ors falling under 
the fall 2002 Bulletin can plan 
on taking an extra three classes 
and creating a leaching portfolio 
before gtadualion and receiving 
Iheir licciise. 

EDUA-F30Q Invilation to 
Teaching; EDUA-K201 Schools, 
Society and EKCeptionality and 
EDUA-K206 Tead\ine Methods 
for Students with Special Needs 
are the three new classes being 
used lo help students become 
more performance based. 

'■We adopted the 10 new 
natiorulslandaidslDdcmoiMliale 
that Ihe teaching candidates can 
not only pass the tEquired classes 
but leach as well.'' said James 
Beard, director of licensing and 
advising. 

In classes such as EDUA&gt; 
F300 sludenls can plan on 
receiving an introduction to Ihe 
10 national stand ants, an intro- 
duction to the requirements for 
the graduation portfolio and 
lectures from area administrators 
and educators. Students will 
also be paired with an educator 
in the East Allen Countv School 
system (or a total of 15 hour^ of 
field experience. 

It is important to note that 
only students who started at 
IPFW in the fall 2002 are 
required lo take the three exlra 
classes. Advisers recommend 



30. 2006, to apply for Iheir 
leactiing license. Any time after 
that date, students enrolled in 
the School at Education will be 
required lo meet the new 
guidelines regardless of what 
bulletin they started under. 

Also bemg changed are the 
majors themselves. What was 
knoivn as an elementary ed uca bon 
major has now branched into 
two majorsi early childhood 
education and middle childhood 
education. Early childhood 
education deals with ages three 
through eight while middle 
childhood education consists of 
ages seven through 12. 

A secondary education 
major has changed into early 
adolescence education and 
adolescence/young adulthood 
education. Early adolescence 
consists of ages 11 through 15 
and adolescence/young adulttiood 
education deals with 
through 18. 

"We have created a middle 

school section for students 

wishing to teach solely at the 

iddlc school level. So instead 






of n 



i}oring II 



students. 

Sludenls enrolled at IPRV 
prior to fall 2002 have until |une 



education students can major in 
early adolescence education," 
Beard said. 

For students wanting to 
keep their opiions open in the 
job field, it is still possible to 
obtain a degree in DOth early 
childhood and ntiddle childhood 
education without having a 
double major. By taking an 
extra three classes, students 
would be licensed to teach 
grades pre-kindergarlen 
through fifth. 

As a result of these changes 
studuils now have Ifie opportunity 
to be licensed lo teach any level 
from pre-kindergartcn lo high 
school.

Lies and Deceit to blame for U.S. woes 



Now i» the time lo de.il 
wilh Ihe North Korea nucleai 
arms silu^ition. 

The North Korea threat is 
smiUi to Ihc Iraqi Ihreal. only 
Iraq has oil weallh and North 
Korea has no wealth. Norlh 
Korea has created a mighly 
military ^nd obtiincd sophisUcalcd 
weaponry in exchange /or 
starving its civilians. 

I am very pleased to see our 
admmistraljon working with 
other global powers in striving 
lo nculralize this new threat. 
Once North Korea's Pyongyang 
oblains or produces nukes 
(which may already be a reality), 
it may t&gt;c loo late lor diplomacy. 

Clearly Ihe North has 
something lo hide; otherwise, 
why would they disguise scud 
missiles as a shipload oF sand 
bound lof nowhere (actually the 
North sold Ihc missiles (o 
Yemen, (heir secret destination). 
The offending ves.sel weni so Tar 
as to paint over Ihe ship's name 
and wasn't even flagged as 
required in inlcmalional walers. 

Now Norlh Korea wants us 
lo apologize for Ihe temporary 

fihipment. How ludicrous. We 
can only hope thai South Korea, 
Japan. Russia, China and 
VVashinglon can convince North 
Korea to end Ihc escalating crisis 
bclore il becomes an aclunl 
stand oil. 

The present Iraqi threat is 
much diflerent. however. 
Saddam Hussein has vast oil 
wc.illh with which lo purchase 
or produce uranium and a sea of 
biological weapons that remain 
unaccounted (or. In a report 
from inspectors before Ihey 
were booted out of Iraq four 
years ago, they listed 360 tons of 
chemical warfare agents, 3,000 
Ions of precursor chemicals, 
growth media sufficient to 
produce approximately 7,0OD 
gallons of anthrax, 300 galtoiu of 
food poisoning ,ind 30,000 
empty shells that could be used 
'&gt;rthedelivc 
nerve agents % 

cxterminale eve 




child, pet and livmg thing in 
every large cily in America, 

Il came as no surprise that 
none of these chemicals were 
listed in Hussein's 12,000-page 
tcporl lo Ihc UN. The prospect 
ol^ another war with Iraq is 
unsettling, but the thought of 
being poisoned by anthrax, 
nuked or gass^-d by Hussein or 
anyone else is far worse. We can 
choose to sit back and wait until 
he pushes the bullon and releases 

neutralize the problem now. 11 
is truly a shame that this has to 
happen. 

America hasn't starved 
Iraqi citizens, cut off their food 
supply: murdered, gassed and 
tortured thousands of innocent 
Iraqis or set up rape camps in 
Kuwait Hussein has, 

VVhen one hears about Ihe 
starving, pitiful, deslilule Iraqis 
and feeb anger at the Uruled 
Stales for its embargoes, consid- 
er Ihis: Hussein iilcrally has 
dozens of presidential palaces in 
Iraq. Many are richly adorned in 
cold and are decorated with the 
finest of cvcrylhing. In 
Hussein's riverside Al-Sajoud 
palace, inspectors found spectacle 
and opulence. Inside the 
palace's eight-sided entry hall. 
Inspectors noted each wall 
ictscribed in huge gold letters 
with a poem praising Hussein. 
America hasn't hurt Iraq, 
Hussein has hurl Iraa and 
continues lo do so every day he 
remains in power. 

At an anii-war prolesl last 
fall in Washington, Americans 
circled Ihe While House and 
denounced the Bush adminislra- 



was going on. Iraqi- 
staged a counler-demonslration

Iraqi-American council, Aziz al 
Tacc. boldly stated, "I think 
America is doing just fine... We 
[lraqi-Americar«l think every 
day Saddam stays in power, he 
kills more of our (amily and 
friends." 

I wonder how many of 
those Americans who were 
denouncing our president that 
day have ever been to Northern 

mustard gas on Kurdish men, 
women and children. I wonder 

would leel if their president had 
murdered their liltle children 
and womenfolk and drafted 
their men at gunpoint lo serve in 
Ihe army? 

Do you know why 
Americans arc hated? It is 
because \vc are rich, free, strong, 
open-minded, optimistic and 
Ihe envy of what every nation 
hopes to be. We aren't sluck in 
Ihe past We don'l belittle 
women. Minorities are equals.

In case you didn't know, 
Americans also work harder

Ihc Japanese folks ore close 
behind us in number of hours 
worked. We don't have time to

President Bush tramples War Powers Act 



To live in the land of the

the Uniled Stales take in living 
in this diverse and bustling

that price is having "no

and even Ihough Ihey have

Bush slill feels the need to furlher 
abuse executive power, as well

This week's topic Iraq and 
Korea and weapons of mass

allowed lo have Ihem? Who 
should be the governing body, 
Ihe ones lo choose which 
nations can be trusted and 
which nations caruiol? I would 
hkc to begin wilh a liltle quiz. 

Who was the first nation lo 
develop nuclear bombs? Who 
has the biggest arsenal of 
nuclear weapor\s? Which nation 
has done the mosi nuclear test- 
ing, bolh underground and 
above ground? Which 
nation has actually used

If you answered America lo 
all these questions, you win or

wdi. lel we don'l even consider 
the consequences, 

Whal would you do if you 
had been a relatively small land 
owner? Your land was rich in oil 
and resources Ihal other more 
powerful tandoivners depended 
on for comfort and survival. The 
more powerful landowners had 
jus I bombed anolhcr landowner 
back lo the stone ages, saying 
Ihal Ihey harbored terrorists. Il 
jusi so happened Ihal land was 
needed lo run a pipeline lo a 
huge oil field. Now Ihey say you 
are part of Ihis terrorist neftvork. 
They have deployed Iroops and 
weapons lo your region. 

Despite ihe faci that you 
have allowed their inspectors 
into your homes, churches and 
land, they say you are nol 
complying wilh their demands. 
IVell you know this 
enemy well, vou have fou^t 
wilh them in ihe pasl. In Ihe lasl 
fight, you both used chemical 
warfare, and Ihe enemy poi- 



oul and fought hard and Ihe 
invasion ended. They went 
home and you were left with (he 
deslniclion of your homeland 
Whal would you do if you were 
Iraq? Would vou give up your 



weapons? Would you IrusI the 
Uniled Stales? 

Now let's consider Korea, 
The lasl lime they were involved 
in debates (T-'a nudcor disarmamenl, 
Ihe Uniled States had jusl

We fight Ihe war against

b^ Israel, They are our allies, 
God's olher chosen people. 
President Bush says Ihal our 
God values all human life, but 
these people don'l value life like 
we do. So let's kill Ihem. I guess 
our Cod values all human life 
except theirs. 

1 had a good friend tell me, 
"All these people understand is 
force. If you don't fighi, they 
don't respect you." Il is easy lo 
kill Ihem, After all. ihey arc 
diffcrcni. They don'l have Ihe 
same genetic, philosophical or 
moral make-up Ihal we do, 1 can

They arc |usl following orders,

on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 
One hundred Ihousond civilian

we are able lo bomb from a clis-

Do I believe Ihal Iraq 
should have \vcapons of mass

Korea should furlher develop its 
nuclear arsenal? No! But I do nol 
l)elieve thai threats and war will 
bring peace. As long as there arc

will be terrorism and war.

can travel it."

been notified aboul such actions, 
correct? Surely, the admirable 
George W. Bush has complied 
wilh Section Three of the War 
Powers Acl Ihal stales "The 
president, in every possible 
instance, shall consult wilh 
Congress before inlroducing 
Uniled Slates Armed Forces into 
hostilities or into situations 
ivhere imminent involvement in 
hostilities is clearly indicated by 
Ihe circumstances, and alter 
every such introduction shall 
consult regularly wilh the 
Congress unlil Uniled Stales 
Armed Forces are no longer 
en^ged in hostilities or have bMn 
removed from such sihjations." 

I do nol know aboul the rest 
of the public, but 1 have yet lo be 
nolified by Mark Souder, Evan 
Bayh and Dick Lugar about any 
consultation Bush has made lo 
Congress about Ihe acts of war 
he is commilling. 

Bush has said Ihal his 



;apon 



the II 



of r 



iqi g( 



supplying lo known lerrorisls 
Older lo lake achon against the 
Uniled Slates. Before Bush 
points the linger at jusl who 
these lerrorisls arc, he probably 
should consult Websler^s 
Concise Dictionary which 
defines a lerrorisi as "one who 
practices lerrorism especially by 
violence committed for political 
purposes, as by a government 
seeking lo intimidate a populace." 

Now if his orders to locate 
lens of thousands of Iroops in 
the Persian Gulf was not lo 
intimidate the populace of Iraq, 
then I would like lo know what 
purpose Ihey hold since Ihetc. is 
no evidence as of yet Ihal Ihere 
have been any weapons of mass 
destruclion located. 

Also, Ihe only armv Ihat 
has any evidence of any 



weapons of mass deslruclion is 
Ihe army of Ihe Uniled Stales 
and even if Hussein did have 
these weapons, it would not be 
that big of a surprise since Ihe 
Uniled Stales has been poinling 
Iheir very own weapons of mass 
destruction al the Middle East 
■ the 19805. 



That 



way 



with lerrorism he may have, but 
I do not believe his actions 
should be an excuse on Bu.ih's 
pari lo throw the Constitution of 
the Uniled Slates oul the win- 
dow. The people of Iraq know 
Ihal Hussein is a heinous war 
criminal, but they should nol be 
punished by a strong police mil- 
itary power that is using its 
power lo maintain a free-trade

which is how history is going lo

'Gangs' not average historical film Grammy nominations questionable 






s that 



ace bolh htslorical and Fictional 
thai can give Ihe viewer a sense 
ot how things must have been in 
the past. Martin Scorsese's 
"Gangs of New York" oehievcs 
this feal. 

Like many accurate historical 

that somclhin^ has always been 
lefl out in history classes, or 
somelimn that the viewer has 
been flat out lied to In history 

"Gangs of New York" tells 
a story that until now, manv 
people did not know enisled. 
That is the story oF the early 
Irish rmmipanls. 

The Fimi begins with a New 
York City that is very diFFerent 
From what Is usually pictured in 
film. The city was torn between 
ethnic street wars between the 
'Native' American gangs, those 
vrhost^ families have already 
made a way for themselves it&gt; 
New York City, and the imn\igi3rt 
families who had just made ihe 
trip across the Atlantic. 

The film's story is a coming 
of age saga for Leonardo 
DiCaprio's character, who calls 
himself Amsterdam for most ot 
the movie, and his search Icr 
revenge aeainsl Daniel Day 
Uwis^ Bilf Ihe Butcher, who 



killed Amsterdam's father. 

While the story is bolh 
cliche and routine in today's 
filnK, and Ihe love interest story 
between DiCaprio and Cameron 
Diaj docs nothing to enhance it. 
above all, the movie is really a 
lesson in how sdciety has always 
worked and continues to work 
in a gang atmosphere. 

whether you are one of the 
privileged few or the very poor, 
or someone in between, society 
is always breaking mto gangs, 
and people associate with those 
who Incy feel comfortable 
around and those who will 
protect them. 

"Gangs of New York" 
makes the point that all Irish 
immigrants came of I Ihe ships to 
be immediately enlisted to fight 
for Ihe Union Army in the Civil 
War. a parallel conflict thai 



worked nicely in the movie lo 
show that things were not 
different anywhere else in the 
United Stales at the lime. Or Ihe 
Irish would have lo fend for 
thenuelves on Ihe streets and 
hope to be taken in by one oF 
immigrant gangs- 

Al though the gang violence 
in the movie is probably as accu- 
rate as could be made, with 
much bloodshed and the culling 
ofF oF ears, a trophy of war dur- 
ing Ihe lights, it was not 
grotesque and was not dwelled 

Instead Ihe film tried lo 
show how pointless the violence 
was, and how Ihe violence 
eventually began lo give way 
and show how the melting pot 
of nationalities oF New York City 
began to take shape and was

Just when it seems like we 
have come so far, we digress. 
The world of music is complete 
with hip'hop, rock, punk, pop, 
soul and every other genre. 
Music was at the top of its game, 
unlit the 2003 Grammy 
Nominees were announced. 

The most prestigious 
category failing lo recogruze the 
deserved set an ugly precedent 
for Ihe others. Eminem. Nelly 
and Bruce Springsteen 

deservedly got nods, but against 
Ihe Dixie Chicks and I*Jorah 
Jones? Where is Justin 
Timberlake amid all of the 
nominations? Where are those 
less heard, but often admired hit 
makers? 

Take For instance a group 
like Dashboard Confessional, 
t^d by fronlman/song writer 
Chris Carraba, Dashboard look 
Ihe country by slorm this year. 
Opening For Weezcr. an amazing 
Un-Pluggcd performance, 
followed ty a CD/DVD package 
of the performance and an 
MTV2 VMA for "Screaming 
Infidelities" were only pawns to 
the masterpiece. 

Wherc are punkers Good 
Charlotte? While short of multi- 
platinum status, the tjuartel, 
plus fill-in drummer Chris, have 
stormed MTV with their show 
■All Things Rock" and are 
begiiuiing lo become household 

point heanJ or seen the heavily 
aired, bolh on television and 
radio, "LiFeslyles of the Rich and 
the Famous? 

But it's not just my favorites 
that get shunned. Jay Z went 
triple platinum, but where is his 
Album or Record oF the Year 
nod? Puddle of Mudd. a group 1 
despise, may only be double 
platinum, but has been on the 
Billboard Top 200 charts for 71 
weeks. Meanwhile the likes ol 
gutter girl Avril Lavigne lakes 
home five nominations? Why 
give these once prestigiotis 



whost 

completely opposite ol her 
dcscnbcd "hardcore skater 
punk." but the same sounding as 
most female singers. 

Did someone forget Kelly 
Clarkson in the shulfle? Sure. 
she has vet lo release her debut 
album, but didn't she release 
one of the best selling singles 
ever? Her single went gold in 
one month after a 236,000 sale 
eFForl in her first week, t under- 
stand that Album oF the Year 
maybe out oF reach, but no Best 
Newcomer nomination for Itie 
"American Idol" winner? I tfunk 

More power to the likes of 
Eminem, who more than

It had been over a month

victory. Durmg that lime, they 
had dropped nine straight 
games, the last six on Ihe road. 

No. the Dons weren't 
hungry for a win over 
Centenary on Saturday, 

Thcv were starving. 

And it didn'l take long for 
Ihe IPFW lo salisfy its hunger as 
Ihe Dons controlled the game 
from the opening tip, on their 
way to a 91-69 wm al the Gales

A win may have been what 
the Dons needed, but they were 
also just glad lo be back at the

"It's been the longest road 
Irip ever We were glad to be

Gcarlds, "Everyone shools a little 
better at home. We weren't 



shooting very well as a team,

"When we get home, we have a

comfortable in our gymnasium. 
You couldn't feel any better 
when you walk back into your

Elmore led Ihe Mastodons 
with a career-high 24 points. She 
also pulled down live rebounds, 

"I think I was more calm on

IPFW answered (vilh a 6-0 over

"It's huge gelling home. I 
don't think anybody realizes

Dons deny lUPUI in overtime 

IPFW snaps eight-gam e losing streak in home win 



IPFW men's basketball coach Doug 
Noll had told his players all season long 
that if they played hard for 40 minutes, 
they could wui. 

Tuesday, the Maslodons had to play 
hard for 45 minutes before Ihey got the 
desired result: a victory. 

Il may have taken overtime, but an 86- 
80 win over lUPUl at the Gates Center was 
worth all five extra minutes. 

"Any win is groat right now." Noll 
said. "We don't play for moral victories, 
bul we play lo get belief. We play to 
compele haracr, and we play lo improve 
each and every day. If we just compete at 
the highest level, good things can happen." 

IPFW (3-13) was led bv Terry Collins 
with 29 points, 12 rebounds, Ihrec assists 
and two steals, while Jim Kessenich had 16 
points and seven boards. Brad Noll 
finished with 13 points, Ihiee assists and 
two steals, and David Simon added 10 

After IPFW (3-13) jumped lo a 4-0 lead 
in the opening minute, the Jaguars quickly 
came back to tie Ihe score at 6-6, Brandon

That was the last basket IPFW would

Earlier in the season, Ihe Dons may 
have folded, bul not this lime. 

"We basically just said lo ourselves as 
a team that if tve picked up our defense 
and played belter offense and took care of 
the ball, then we'd come oul wilh a ivin," 
Collins said. 

Still dowm hy 12 wilh iusl under 10

"It's big when Terry plays with 
confidence because he doesn't feel there's a 
guy that can actually guard him," Doug Noll 
said. "He won't say that, but he'll just go out 
and do that." 

IPFW merely stayed close to lUPUl 
until a basket by QuintinCarouthers tied the 
score and a layup by Noll gave Ihe Dons a 
31-29 lead with ]-,47 on the clock. A jumper 
^ and a freg throw by Bradley Qdjjll gave Uie^
