"My God, it's my father!" 

-Margaret Truman Daniel, Time Magazine 

"'Harry' is not only a fond remembrance of a fiery char- 
acter, it is a crash course in one segment of history 
for the younger generation whose lives were never 
directly affected by the man. And more importantly, it 
is a memorable evening of the theatre" 

-Edwa., Daily Variety 

"Truman was the sort of man who realized that being 
President was not the same as being king'.' 

-lamm, Rock Group Chicago 

"It's fun to see important men in high places drop their 
pants'.'

What does ROTC 

have to offer 
a veteran like me? 




A lot. Let's start with 
$100 per month, tax free. 
That's what we will pay 
while you are enrolled in 
the advanced course. And 
that is in addition to any 
Gl Bill benefits you are 
now receiving. 

Upon graduation, you 
will be commissioned a 
2nd Lieutenant at a start- 
ing salary of $11,565, if you 
have three years prior ex- 
perience. That is more 
than the average starting 
salary paid to the 1975 
graduates who were lucky 
enough to find jobs. 

You also will receive 



30 days paid vacation 
every year. Plus all your 
medical and dental ex- 
penses paid by the Army. 
And an automatic pay 
raise when the cost of 
living increases. Not a bad 
benefit package, is it? 

You have already in- 
vested part of your life 
in military service. Why 
throw that investment 
away? Put it to use and 
be paid for it. Contact 
U.S. Army ROTC, Ft. 
Wayne, at 422-7808, or 
stop by our booth on the 
ground floor of Kettler 
Hall.

Your time Is valuable. Not ti 
mention your money. So'why fight that 
noon hour traffic, the crowded parking 
lots and less -than- friendly waitresses? 
Just to pay a dollar and quarter or more 
for a smalHunch. 



Lunch in the Student Union beats all 
that. You don't have to leave campus. 
That saves you time, gas and 
aggravation. And, best of all, it saves 
you money. Service you can't beat at a 
price you can't beat.
