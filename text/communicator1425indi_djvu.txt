Besides raising student fees. Car- 
naghi said funds to some academic 
departments might also be cut to make 
up for a lack ol slate funds. Money 
could also be reallocated from one 
deparlmenl to another, he added. "TTie 
balancing of the budget Is a com- 
binalion of increasing income from 
student tees and reallocation and-or 
reduction of cupendituies," Camaghl 

Whether or nol the SFC recommends 
a higher mcrease in funds for IPFW 
depends on how much money Ihe tax 
increase brings in, Camaghl said. '"nie 
more money the tax collections show, 
the more likely we'll gel greater sp*

Afghanistan situation 
tragic, uncontrollable 



ByANDERSORHEMUS 
SlaKWriter 

"We must never lei ourselves forget 
about the tragic situation in 
Afghanistan," said Phyllis Oakley, 
head of Ihe U.S. Slate Depaiiment's 
Afghan desk. Shespokeat IPFW March 

Tlie Iheme of her prcsentallon was: 
"Afghanistan: Soviets' Vielnam?" She 
started by expanding on that question. 

"Hie Soviet invasion at Afghanistan 
Li. as well as the American Vielnam 
War. something you

I. Every conflict 
this is BO comi^eii. For InsUnce. Ihe 
Moscow government doesn't have 
pubUc opinion against them s&gt; the U.S. 
had during the Vletnatn era, because 
they lack our democratic system." 

To the hard-resisting guerrillas, 
Soviet rule since Ihe 1979 Invasion 
under Babrak Karmal hasn't been 
achieved. 

"During the last sIk months, the 
Soviets have acted more aggressively 
then before and now have oi many ai 
im.vn troops there. It's a military 
sUndoff," she sold. "The odds in favor 
of the 'mulahldin' (guerrillas) are 
thegrGtically very small, but the Soviet 
(allure to win over Ihe mountain -based. 
Independent guerrilla is amaiing." she 



said, 
Oskley. a 



T diplomat with e 



perience Irom the Middle East and 
Zaire, said. "The regime is facing very 
serious problems right now. Tlie whole 
society is war-lorn. Agriculture and 
Industry arc so bad ihe Sovlels have to 
supply big amounts of food and money 
to keep the country going. 

"One of the saddest parts of the whole 
war Is Ihe refugees," she said. A fllth of 
the population, 2.i million people, live 
in retugee camps, basically in 
Pakistan. The United Nalions, Red 
Cross and olher tnlematloDal or- 
ganlutions are working with the 
Pakistani people in order to help the 
fleeing Moslems, she sold, 

United Slates has laken a strong 
opposition towards the Soviel In- 
terventlan, and has almost global 
support "We have urged a negatialed

elements spelled out by the U.N. — 
complete withdrawal of Soviet forces, 
sell-delerminatlnn of Ihe people,

"One major problem Is we don't know 
what the Soviets' iolenlfons are. We 
know the occupation is an em- 
barrassing a((olr for them awj they 
want perhaps to get oul of iL But we
