*(Bank Machine On Campus) 



Meet the OWL. Just the kind of friend a 
college student needs. He hangs out at The 
Fort everyday. Carries a lot of cash. He's always 
there for you, anytime of the day or night, and 
he's a great listener. 

If 24-hour access to your bank accounts 
sounds like a good deal to you, make friends 
with the OWL, on the ground floor at Walb 
Memorial Union Hall. And get your free OWL 
card at any office of Fort Wayne National 
Bank. Where helping out our friends is just
