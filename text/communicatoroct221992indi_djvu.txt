NEWS BRIEFS 



LOCAL METEOROLOGIST 
PREDICTS SNOWY WINTER 

A[ leasi one local mctcorologisi saw Tuesday's 
snowfall coming and sees more on the horiMn for 
ihc Fort Wayne area. 

"1 predicled a snowfall before Halloween," said 
Mike Glaser, a meieorologisi from WANE-TV . 

Glascr said he gleaned ihc informaiion from 
weather dau predicting below normal tempera- 
tures and above normal precipitation, 

"Thai kind of a long term outlook usually indi- 
cates snow," said Glaser, "I'm the only on-air 
meteorologist in the WANE-TV viewing area to 
have predicted a snowfall this early for this year." 

"Normally the Fon Wayne area gets about 31 
inches of snow per year," said Glaser, "But I con 
see possibly 35 lo 4D inches of snow this winter. 
I'm being conservative." 

Glaser said a record setting snow year for the 
area was "nol outside possibilities." 

An early snow is nol necessarily indicative of a 
particularly harsh winter season, noted Glaser, 

"We got eight to ten inches on Oct, 19 and 20 in 
1989," said Glaser, "We got just over one inch 
T\iesday morning." 

According to Mike Hayes of the National 
Weather Service's Fort Wayne office, Tuesday's 
snow was the seventh time since 1913 that more 
than an inch of snow has fallen on one day in the 
month of October. 

Hayes said this year's lower tcmperalures are 
blamed by some scientists on the explosion of Ml 
Pinatubo and the resulting ash cloud currently 
encircling Earth. 

"The temperature has dropped aboul two 
degrees in most areas," said Hayes, a weather ser- 
vice specialist, "and we do take this into account 
in long range outlooks." 

The current national weather service long range 
oudook, according to Hayes, calls for above aver- 
age precipitation and below average temperatures.

m TRUSTEES TO HOLD FORUM 
FOR STUDENTS, FACULTY 

Eric Todd and Ray Richardson, Indiana 
University trustees, will hold an open forum for 
students and faculty in the Walb Memorial Union 
first fioor lounge on OcL 29. The meeting will 
run (mm 5:15 p.m. until 6:15 p.m. 

The lU trustees will be on campus OcL 29 for 
their annual IPPN board meetings. Richardson 
and Tbdd will be holding the special public 
meeting to up close with studenis and faculty 
members. 

"We want to hear the practical day to day prob- 
lems students and instructors have at this universi- 
ty," Richardson said. "This will give people the 
opportunity la apjffoach us on an individual, per- 
sonal basis." 

"The two of us decided that the board was not 
accessible enough. So we arc saying, here we arc, 
come and sec us," Richardson added. 

CAMPUS COPS OFFER ADVICE 
FOR BAD WEATHER TRAVEL 

Campus police and officials are advising stu- 
dents to take precautions when craveUing to IPFW 
during inclement weather conditions, according to 
Lauren DenHanog, chief of police and director of 
safety. "Usually accidents do increase," said 
DenHartog. "Students should try to leave for cam- 
pus early if possible. You should give yourself 
plenty of time." 

According to Richard Ritchie, vice chancellor of 
financial affairs, school officials will take 
inclement weather conditions on campus into con- 
sideration when deciding whether to close the 
campus during the winter storm season. 

"We consider the road conditions on campus and 
in the parking areas and the physical plant's abili- 
ty to keep the roads on campus open." said 
Ritchie. "During the night the physical plant 
begins cleaning the roadways, parking areas and 
sidewalks on campus." 

"We will do everything we can to keep the cam- 
pus open," said Ritchie. 

"If it becomes apparent that we can't keep up 
with the snow we give the order for closing." said 
Ritchie. 

Ritchie advises studenis to tunc into local radio 
and television stations if there is doubt as to the 
status of campus during a winter storm. 

"We also have a recorded message students may 
call for weather emergency information." said 
Ritchie. 

Ritchie said students from outlying areas may 
want w take local weadier facton into considera- 
tion before setting out for campus. 

Tuesday's unexpected snowfall may have been 
the cause of a minor collision in the athletic center 
parking lot 

"Parking lots are dangerous," said DenHartog, 
"People are coming at you from all directions." 

DenHanog advises drivers to maintain a safe 
following distance, drive defensively and wear 
their seat belts. 

"People should make sure their windows and 
lights are clear of snow and ice," said DenHartog, 
"They clear one little area in the windshield and 
think they're all seL" 

"If all you can sec is one litde area, il's like hav- 
ing tunnel vision. It's really hard to see the other 
guy and to drive defensively." said the chief. 

The campus weather emergency line is 481- 
6050.

Faculty seeks release from Purdue's grip 



By Sarah Jakacky 
Chief Reporter 

Conflicts with Purdue 
University at West Lafayette 
have resulted in an unanimous 
vote by an IPFW faculty senate 
committee requesting complete 
fiscal autonomy, 

The financial independence 
IPFW is asking for, according to 
committee member Steve 
Hollander, would offer the 
school an opportunity "to make 
our mistakes, instead of doing 
what Purdue dictates. We're 
treated like children, and wc arc 
capable of making our own 
decisions." 

Under the current agreement 
between Purdue and IPFW, 
Purdue is in charge of the man- 
agement and spending of 
IPFW's money. Aldiough the 
faculty senate wants to keep the 
academic relationship with 
Purdue. Hollander said IPFW 
needs freedom. 

"I believe West Lafayette 
believes diey do things for our 
own good, but they don't under- 
stand the unique character of 



our joint campus," Hollander 
explained. 

Changes proposed by the fa- 
ulty senate committee include 
eslDblishing an eight-member 
council to advise the chancellor 
on policy issues, and control 
over the student code of con- 
duct would be given to faculty 
members with IPFW student 



"We're treated like chil- 
dren, and we are capa- 
ble of making our own 
decisions." 
Sieve Hollander 



government and administrative 
inpuL 

Also. IPFW would maintain 
its own budget with more flexi- 
bility to interpret Purdue's 
rules, and the chancellor would 
gain more power in setting poli- 
cies for IPFW. 

According to Hollander, there 
are many motivations behind 
declaring independence. 
Reasons range from disagree- 



ments over faculty salary 
increases, to basic policy deci- 
sions, to what colors new build- 
ings will be painted. 

Trivial matters, explained 
Hollander, pop up almost daily. 
"We are treated like children 
who can't make up their own 
minds." 

He added most of the time 
IPFW avoids conflicts with 
Purdue by not telling them what 
is going on here, or by lying. 

"It is an enormous brain-drain 
having to deal with it," 
Hollander said. 

Hollander noted the code of 
conduct was an important is?ue. 
Last year IPFW created a code 
of conduct which included a ban 
on discrimination based on sex- 
ual orientation. 

Purdue deleted sexual orienta- 
tion from the code, angering 
both students and faculty. 

Additionally, Hollander 
argued if IPFW can gain fiscal 
autonomy, our financial returns 
will increase. He said profits 
would not be immediate, but the 
campus's profit margin would 



eventually be greater. 

Bill Frederick, associate pro- 
fessor of computer science and 
presiding officer of faculty sen- 
ate, noted, "We are a mature 
enough university that we need 
to sever the financial connec- 
tion. But we should retain our 
academic alliances 
with lU and Purdue." 

Frederick said the 
faculty senate's next 
move is to come up 
with strategies to 
achieve the desired 
autonomy. "We have 
been charged to con- 
tinue bringing up 
proposed means for 
fiscal independence." Joanne 
he said. 

Frederick also noted the 
administration at IPFW. for the 
most pan, supported the push 
for financial freedom. "But the 
administration won't buy into 
that in public. They enjoy keep- 
ing their jobs. Because of tenure 
I can say things about this." 

IPFW ChanceLor Joanne Lantz 
said a separation from Purdue, if 



B long 




it happened, would take a 
time to implcmenL 

"We're looking at minimally 
a year's worth of planning. It's 
very easy to talk about, but very 
hard to do. This is a complicat- 
ed process," explained Laniz. 
Lantz said the fiscal end of 
IPFW is very 
demanding and 
would cost us more 
money in the long 
run. She added 
IPFW has signifi- 
cant input in the 
decision-making 
process of our cam- 
pus. 

"We don'l 
operate in a vacu- 
um. We are operat- 
ing under a management agree- 
ment with Purdue, and they 
aren't asserting authority over 
us. We have given it to them," 
Lantz said. 

Hollander added if Purdue 
trustees deny IPFW's request, 
die faculty senate may petition 
the Indiana General Assembly 
for independence.

IPFW drops child care service 



By Mike Wade 
Managing Editor 

Studenis with young children 
will no longer be able to utilize 
EduCare. IPFW's child care 
service, as die school has pulled 
out of the program. 

Nearly one hundred IPFW 
fanulies may be affected by the 
decisioa 

EduCare, also known as the 
child care constHtium, will lose 
IPFW as a member on Dec. 31, 
according to Frank Borelli. vice 
chancellor for student affairs. 

The consortium originally had 
four members; IPFW. IVY 
Tech. Parkview Memorial 
Hospital, and the State 
Developmental Center. 

The developmental center 
previously withdrew from the 
consortium. 

"The difficult decision to 
withdraw from the consortium 
was based solely on financial 
considerations and the escalat- 
ing cost of continued member- 
ship." according to a statement 
issued by Borelli. 

Debbie Beck, an IPFW stu- 
dent who utilizes die facility, 
said she couldn't understand 
how this could be tnie. 

"IPFW had control of the 
facility. How can they claim 



they have financial difficulties? 
All costs incurred were foresee- 
able and controllable." said 
Beck. 

Marian Zimmerman, dean of 
students, also said the move 
was purely financial. 

"We share in the deficit of the 
center with the other members. 
It was getting so bad that we 
could no longer slay with it," 
said Zimmerman. 

Beck still questions the rea- 
sons for the withdrawal, saying, 
"They are giving everybody a 
snow job. If it is such a finan- 
cial burden, I would like to 
know how IVY Tech can still 
be in the consonium." 

Zimmerman also wonders 
about IVY Itch. 

"IVY Tech has a huge 
involvement with the consor- 
tium, I'm sure it was difficult 
for them, and I'm sure our 
pulling out will make it even 
more difficult for them to con- 
tinue." said Zimmerman, 

As many as 150 children may 
be affected by the decision, 
according to Zimmerman. 

"IPFW had 94 families using 
the facility. Many of them had 
more than one child in the cen- 
ter. It will be especially hard for 
those who need the service to 



be able to come to school. They 
will be hurt the most," said 
Zimmerman. 

Beck said she was one of 
those people. 

"There's no way 1 could have 
gone back to school without 
that service. If I can't still use 
the center, I won't be able to 
continue at IPFW. I've even 
considered transferrring to IVY 
Tfech," said Beck 

Parkview has agreed to con- 
tinue child care service for full 
time children of IPFW students 
if space permits, according to 
Zimmerman. 

The office of titc dean of stu- 
dents is trying to help students 
who only require part-time ser- 
vices locate other child care 
centers, said Zimmerman. 

According to Borelli, IPFW 
will start a task force to study 
the issue and determine how die 
needs of the people affected can 
best be met 

"My hope is that some viable 
alternatives can bo put in place 
forfall 1993." said Borelli. 

IPFW EduCare parents and 
the IPFW administration will 
hold a meeting on Oct. 22, in 
the ballroom of Walb Memorial 
Union at 8 p.m. to discuss die 
situation. 




EduCare worker VIckl McCrady may not be seeing Christina 
Caravelta or Ryan Keebler after the first of the year. The chil- 
dren she Is reeding to here have IPFW parents. Pfaolo by Troy

"righteousness of

Soon, he recognized the faults 
of the agency. 

In 1969 Agee resigned from 
the CIA after involvement in 
covert operations in Latin 
America, Since then he has 
written numerous books reveal- 
ing what he calb die reconstruc- 
tion of events and methodology 
of the agency. 

Numerous times throughout 
the lecture the former agent 
stressed he did not resign to 
write the books. 

"The CIA is a terrible fadure," 
the former agent declared. His 
reasoning included die creation 




of political repression in foreign 
countries, and billions of dollars 
spent unneceasarily duiaugh die 
defense budget that is not going 
toward the good of die people. 

Also. Agee said instead of 
projecting an objective analysis 
of events, the CIA tries to dis- 
tort facts in their favor. 

Agee questioned die need for 
the current cost of the defense 
budget in light of the recent 
Soviet collapse, blaming 
President George Bush. 

Other failures of the agency, 
according to Agee, include 
involvement in foreign intelli- 
gence, and election interference, 
"Electoral interven- 
tion is the bread and

by the CIA all the

be used for hostile purposes 
because "we need to keep the 
peace, not operate against

touched on involved the role of

CIA officials call Agee 'traitor' 



By Sarah Jakacky 
Chief Reporter 

CIA insidera c^ Philip Agee 
"a traitor" and say he is 
responsible for the deadis of 
several agents. 

1\vo CIA officials, contacted 
by this newspaper, agreed 
Agee's exposure of covert 
operations has directly and 
indirectly resulted in the deadis 
of agents woiking abroad. 

Agee has written books, 
since leaving the CIA, that 
revealed the identities of 
agents abroad, according to die 
CIA contacts. 

One agency personnel mem- 
ber discredited everything 
Agee has revealed as being "so 
grossly exaggerated" diat there 
is no tnidi to them, The agent 
said Agee has based his whole 
career on condemning the OA. 

"I have complete disrespect 
for him," he said. The agent 
also said the entire CIA organi- 
zation has an exU'emely low 
opinion of Agee. 

According to die agent, Agee 
has violated everything the 
CIA represents. He detailed 
the CIA's mission as being 
responsible for collecting use- 
ful intelligence abroad that 



may be helpful to die U.S.. and 
engaging in covert operations. 

All CIA agents must take an 
oath to not disclose any 
sources or methods used dur- 
ing missions. Agee clearly 
violated his oadi. 

According to official CIA 
documents. Agee was a less- 
than-satisfactory agent who 
was not fulfilling his obliga- 
tions to the Central 
Intelligence Agency. 

"Many in the agency see 
Agee as a traitor. He is 
not a fool, and he is quite 
articulate. 
■-CIA agent 

Near the lime of his last 
assipment in Mexico City, the 
agent said Agee was going 
through a divorce and was a 
heavy alcoholic. CIA docu- 
ments state Agee was involved 
in "sexual indiscretions." 
specifically in Mexico City. 
Agee also had romantic 
involvements in Cuba. 

CIA documents note Agee 
was working as a paid spy for 
the Cuban and Soviet govern- 
ments. The CIA said Agee 



still works for the Cubans, and 
"he makes a lot of money 
doing iL" 

A second source, a former 
agency personnel member, col- 
labonued CIA reports. 

"Many in the agency see 
Agee as a traitot He is not a 
fool, and he is qaite articulate," 
he admitted. 

Undoubtedly, the former 
member said Agee's allega- 
tions are not accurate. 

"Personally, I do not diink 
the organization is as Agee 
portrays it Of course, it is not 
lily-white and fauldess, but die 
CIA is necessary in any free 
society," he expUned. 

Because Agee is considered 
to be hostile towards the 
American government, his 
U.S. passport was revoked in 
1979. Agee b also banned in 
five NATO countries. After 
petitioning U.S. courts to rein- 
state his passpon, Agee widi- 
drew his plea when defectors 
revealed he was a Cuban spy. 

Since then, the agent said 
Agee travels on an Internation- 
al passport giving lectures 
attempting to provoke radical 
and leftist groups to react 
against the U.S. govemmenL

American legal system 
should protect gay rights 



The rights of many homosexuals 
are at stoke. Come November, vot- 
ers in Oregon and Colorado will 
have the opportunity to vote on 
whether or not homosexuals will 
be extended the same rights all 
other Americans take for granted. 

Those voters can decide that 
homosexuallity is "immoral, per- 
verse, and should be discouraged." 

If the voters of those stales 
agree, resident homosexuals could 
lose their lives as they know them. 

It would then be legal for 
employers to dcscriminate against 
homosexual employees. 

Such employees could lose their 
jobs in the name of a higher 
national morality. They could no 
longer seek salvadon in the courts. 
Considering the uninformed opin- 
ions of the majority, they would 
become unemployable. 

Not only would we rob these 
people of their rights, we would 
end up paying for their food, shel- 
ter, lives. Precisely because we 
chose to give them so Lttle. 

These people could be denied 
access to restnuranis, health clubs, 
even schools. 

Even IPFW. where the president 
of Purdue refused to approve a 
student conduct code which pro- 
tected members of the IPFW com- 
munity from such discrimination. 

Just as we have been fighting for 



years to end the separation which 
exists between the races, we are 
now fighting to set up that separa- 
tion with regard to sexual orienta- 
tion. 

The separation would end up 
costing us all much more thanwe 
can afford. We cannot withdraw 
constitutional rights from one 
group without jeopardizing the 
rights of our own. 

As a nation, we must come to 
terms with our environment. By 
robbing these people of their 
rights, we will undoubtedly end up 
paying for their existence. 

If we take away their right to 
education — because we don't 
want them next to our children — 
we will force them into seeking 
low-education jobs. 

Jobs they won't be able to get, 
because we don't want them 
working next to our brothers. 

And we will force them out of 
our neighborhoods, because they 
should live and die with their own. 

And they will either be bom in 
the closet and stay there, or they 
will be fwccd into low-income — 
tax payer supported — housing. 

We need to educate ourselves. 
not rob others of the priviledge. 
We have too many uneducated, 
poverty stricken people in this 
nation already. We need progress, 
not degredation. 



Willson calls AIDS solution 
to 'unnatural' homosexuality 



By Greg WUlsoD 
Guest Columnist 
IPFW Student 

Over the past several weeks, 
there seems to have been renewed 
interest in the subject of homosex- 
ual rights on the pages of this 
paper. 

In this paper's attempt to bring 
both sides of the story, they have 
asked me to write a column giving 
an opposing viewpoint to an edito- 
rial elsewhere in this issue. 

As any of you who have read last 
week's paper will realize. I am 
stricdy anti-homosexual. But I 
have what 1 believe to be justifi- 
able reasons behind this. 

I have three major reasons why 
homosexuality is wrong and peo- 
ple who practice ii should not be 
given special or equivalent rights 
to everyone else. The three rea- 
sons arc: Biological, 
Physiological, and Religious. 

The biological aspect should be 
obvious. The simple fact is that 
the human body was not designed 
that people of the same gender 
should be having sex with one 
another. 

As I said last week, if it were 
meant for everybody to have sex 
with everybody else, not only 
would everybody have male and 
female reproductive organs, but 
the terms gender, male and female 
would have no meaning. 
Obviously that is not the case, 
therefore in my view homosexual- 
ity is wrong. 

The physiological aspect also 
proves my poinu The physiologi- 
cal aspects (such as hormones and 
fluid imbalances) have been stud- 
ied by psychologists and others 
interested in why homosexuals 
behave the way they do. 

While it has been shown that dif- 
ferences in hormone levels do lead 
lo more gentle men and more 



aggressive women, they have yet 
to link any kind of hormone 
imbalance to homosexuality. 
Leading further to the conclusion 
that it is unnatural. 

In continuing the above idea. 
why would psychologists be 
studying homosexuality so 
intensely if it were not abnormal? 
1 have taken a psych class. 
Homosexuality was considered a 
mental disorder when we dis- 
cussed iL 

It is quite obviously out of the 
norm. TTiat is why they study iL 

The final and perhaps most con- 
troversial reason: Religion, 
Anyone who care.s what happens 
to homosexuals may be interested 
in reading Genesis chapter 19. 
Anyone remember Sodom and 
Gomorrah? Or how about 1 
Corinthians 6:9? It pretty well 
spells out where homosexuals end 
up. 

You eldier are burnt up by burn- 
ing sulfiir (Genesis) or wind up in 
Hell (1 Corinthians). Bui hey if 
you support homosexuals or are 
homosexual you probably don't 
believe that anyway right? All I 
have to say is that you're going to 
suffer, not me, 

The reason that 1 have said the 
above is to show that homosexual- 
ity is immoral, unethical and phys- 
ically or biologically wrong. It 
goes against the laws of nature. It 
goes against the laws, period. Do 
you give murderers special rights 
and privileges? Why then should 
people doing contemptuous acts 
such as homosexuality be allowed 
thai privilege? If homosexuals 
want rights let them go straighL 

If not, let them go to California 
where most of the homosexuals 
arc. rrfaybe we'll all get lucky and 
they'll get AIDS and keel over. 
That would certainly cure the 
problem, wouldn't it? 




LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 



We all deserve 
rights under 
constitution 

lb the editon 

Mr. WUIson, up until thb point I 
had read with fading interest the 
batde of written words chat you 
and Mr, Snyder are presently 
engaged in. I do not seek to 
choose one side or the other, but 
simply want lo point out some 
fallacies In your letter which ran 
in the OcL 15 issue of this paper. 

My contention is with your 
staiemeat that homosexuals do 
not "deserve" rights. It would 
then follow that you do not 
deserve any rights either. Our 
consdtution guarantees each one 
of tis rights, in case you've forgot- 
ten. It was assumed at birth that 
those rights were ours to keep and 
enjoy. Unfortunately, folks like 
you would radier not let some 
Americans-people who arc. as 
much as you hate to admit it, just 
like you and mc-have the rights 
dmt are as much Uicirs as yours. I 
think it truly sad that you would 
deny a person his or her rights 
simply because of their sexual 
preference. That is a very disturb- 
ing thought 

I will in no way try Lo feed you 
a Une. That is mere logistics. It 
doesn't really matter why a per- 
son says thoy are gay, now, docs 
it? The fact is, they are. You are 
not seeing the forest for the trees. 
We as a nation need to get past 
our silly prejudices and try to live 
together. Don't you think that it 
would be a whole lot better If we 
would just admit our differences, 
admil that wc don't agree, and 
love each oihe/? 

And by the way, you can't even 
hope lo convince me that morality 
doesn't include love for your fel- 
low human beings. I don't care 
whether you agree with what they 
believe or noL 

That, my friend, is simply not 
the point at all, and what's more, I 
think you knew that already.

Homosexuals 
deserve equal 
treatment 

By Titn Schrelbcr 
Stoff Writer 

In a recent letter to the editor, stu- 
dent Greg Willson made some state- 
menu about homosexuality thai greit- 
ly disturbed me. I would like to uko 
this opportunity to respond to those 
siBiemcnts. 

The statement that I found moit 
appalling was the one that said that 
homosexuals "don't deserve rights." 
Mr, Willson then went on to say ihit 
"homosexuality b immoral, unnatural, 
and goes against all die principles that 
this country was founded on." 

Rrsi of all, Mr. WiUson, you seem to 
be confusing "having no morab" with 
"not having your morab." There is a 
difTerence. you know. 

Personally, I ihlnk that verbal gay- 
bashing, prejudice, and the denial of 
rights based on a persm's sexual pref- 
erence are immoral. But then, that's 
just my personal belief. 

And that's what this country wu 

founded upon, the freedcni of personal 

beliefs. That is, unless you are a 

homosexual. Then you don'l deserve

THE COMMUNICATOR 



Sex, Sighs, and Elaborate Tripe 



To the Editor: 
Tamily Values," thai recent addi- 
tion lo the lexicon of today's social- 
ly and politically conscious pscu- 
do-inietlcciual, is no more than a 
cipher fw sexual repression and yet 
one more atlempl to reinforce 
monogamy as the touchstone of 
decency. 

Somewhat over twenty ycar^ ago. 
I , like many others of my genera- 
tion, cmbaiiced on a bold mission. 
We sought nothing less than to 
reconstnicl sex and desire. My par- 
ticular social eitpcriment was car- 
ried out with an assortment of other 
politically animated and sensually 
inclined students in the indulgent 
atmosphere of the 19603. We 
grandly declared an end to the sti- 
fling practice of monogamy and its 
hypocritical corollary, the clandes- 
tine affair. Instead, we would col- 
lectivize sex and intimacy, building 
an extended family of friends and 
lovers. 

Our brave new sexual world was 
elaborately worked ouL We knew 
there were historical precedents for 
what we were trying, and we drew 
inspiration from the lives and 
worlcs of Emma Goldman, Simone 
de Beauvoir and Jean Paul Sartre, 
Norma O. Brown and Hcrben Mar- 
cuse. 

If this sounds as if our lives 
became overly analyzed and bela- 
bored, it was. The regimentation 
was carried too far, but the erotic 
content of all of this was intense. 
Men and women felt no shame in 
roaming about our dwellings in 
various states of undress. Women 
slept with women, men with 
women, and occasionally men with 
men. The sexual borderlines were 
not clearly defined, and we often 
wandered over them. In short, any- 
body and everybody was a poten- 
tial lover. 

Al this point, it is customary to 
sign and dismiss all this youthful 
indulgence. But I refuse to cooper- 
ate. I still believe that our experi- 
ment in unrestrained pleasure was 
vastly superior to" the monogamy- 
adultery syndrome that leads so 
many into clandestine assignations 



in cheap &lt;or not so cheap) hotel 
rooms and took me through one of 
the most ignominious and destruc- 
tive periods of my life. So in recent 
years I've tried lo draw around me 
an intimate circle of lovers and 
erotic friends based on honesty and 
a desire for living life to its utmost. 

Nowdays, the pursuit of the 
unimaginable— if it is done with 
honesty and perhaps some princi- 
ple behind it--makcs one a candi- 
date for a guest appearance on a 
daytime talk show. Everything 
from feminist scholarship lo men's 
magazines has enshrined 
monogamy. To advocate sexual 
experimentation in today's cultural 
climate is to risk charges thai you 
are proselytizing for promiscuity- 
as if there were no sensible ground 
between marriage and bacchanalia. 
Even if you successfully counter 
that charge, there is still the linger- 
ing suspicion that you have not 
fully matured, that your arc a hope- 
less Peter Pan--as if being a 
responsible adult were incompati- 
ble with being an erotic one. Final- 
ly, there is the accusation that you 
are a walking incubator of dread 
diseascs-as if there were not ways 
to practice safe sex while sleeping 
with a variety of lovers. 

In '90s America, there is an awe- 
some momentum toward sexual 
conservatism, a massive shift that 
not only preceded the onslaught of 
AIDS, but in fact welcomed this 
scourge as a cultural purgative. 
Even the anti-sexual ideology of 
the New Right, while flouting rules 
of reason, defends unjust sexual 
laws notwithstanding that most 
Americans favor loJerance of sexu- 
al variations and lifestyles. The lib- 
eration of sexual imagination in the 
'60s and early '70s deeply trauma- 
tized some elements of society, 
resulting in the conservative back- 
lash against abortion, feminism, 
sex-education, pornography, gay 
rights, and other manifestations of 
"penTiissiveness." As a result, sex 
has become a potent issue because 
of a perplexing and seemingly end- 
less conflict of beliefs as to the 
appropriate ways of living our sex- 



ualitics. In recent years we have 
witnessed a faltering, and retreat, 
of sexual liberation, a resurgence 
of a political movement in defense 
of traditional norms, a wave of 
moral panic around sex, of which 
the recent crisis over AIDS is an 
example; and finally a deadlock 
over the appropriate forms of regu- 
lating sex. 

I would argue that sexual libera- 
tion is itself icdundanL Sex is lib- 
eration if we Just know how to 
approach it. It has been history's 
political and religious institutions 
that have conspired to deny us our 
full human potential. By co-opting 
the sex drive to the poUtical end of 
behavior modification, society has 
turned a natural biological drive 
into an unnatural obsession. 

Our moral fundament cannot 
entertain even a .suggestion of life- 
styles odier dian monogamy. But if' 
we must talk about morality, then 
all I can say is: only thai which 
contributes to our mutual isolation 
is morally reprehensible, and only 
that which strengthens human soli- 
darity is correct. It is ihis monoga- 
mous principle and so called mid- 
dle-class social life that has 
become the most effective means 
of exclusion, a trivial form of 
pornography--a mockery of our 
longing for liberation. Whatever 
one may think of sexual liberation 
as the last hope for mankind, it is at 
least a step in the right direction of 
spiritual and cultural freedom and 
of sexual cquality-and a step away 
from monogamous cannibalism 
and ovcrspecialization in love. 

Buckminister Fuller pointed out 
thai over speciali2ation has always 
meant ruin for cultures as well as 
for species. It s-pells anthropologi- 
cal as well as biological disaster. 1 
believe that at the moment, our 
goals with regard lo sexuality 
should be dilettantism, naivete, and 
superficiality, and that we should 
strive to achieve them in whatever 
way we c^. Only then can we be 
truly libcraied.

Helmke issue 



Students should learn to use library 



To the Editor 

The defense on pan of die Helmke 
library by W. Scott Homes was 
excellently done. Holmes was, how- 
ever, incredibly kind in admonishing 
the students for lack of rcsponstbih- 
ty. [ am a student who works at the 
library, and I am able to see that 
lacking. 

First, there exists a lack of know- 
ing how to use the resources provid- 
ed. Most freshmen comp. classes 
give tours, and the library itself 
gives tours. Most of the staff is will- 
ing to take the lime from correcting 
and preventing student errors, to 
help the students. A research librari- 
an IS readily available. We even have 
one librarian from the downtown 
library working here in order to help 
out. The resources are available. If a 
student cannot find something, all 
these reasons point "at fault" (most 
likely) to the student 

There are, granted, difficulties with 
some resources and document deliv- 
ery. Yet, I feel as if students are for- 
getting that the campus is yet young. 
It does, ladies and gents, take time to 
build fantastic resources. We are 
lucky to have the IQ. We are being 
selfish if we become perturbed that 



an ordered book is an 'unavailable' 
status. Other campuses, such as 
Bloomington, Kokomo. and South 
Bend have students too. Some of 
llhese campuses are younger and 
smaller than ours. We are still build- 
ing facilities for specific studies, that 
qualifies this as a young school. 

Another aspect of the student's 
irresponsibility lies within the use of 
the materials. This problem corre- 
lated directly to finances. Homes 
illustrated the small amount of 
funds available lo the library. The 
library budgets for materials and 
staff and that's it, right? Hardly. A 
protection system against theft has 
to be installed. Materials with 
pecled-off labels, ripped-out pages 
and liquid stains have to be repaired 
and replaced. Stolen materials have 
to be replaced. 

The above processes constitute 
only a small amount of the jobs 
which require working bodies and 
money to pay ihem. Volunteers arc 
hard to come by, though we do have 
a few. If students would bother to re- 
shelve correctly, for instance, less 
money would be spent and less 
materials damaged. For instance, the 
serials floor offers cans in which 



students should place materials 
they've used. They have illustrated 
incompetency in shelving them cor- 
recUy, so we do it Yet, rather than 
uses those conveniently placed cans, 
students leave the materials on desks 
and tables, or they just throw Uiem 
somewhere on the shelf. 

Today 1 found thirty-five items 
askew in one section consisting of 
two journal series. Some of the 
bounded and loose volumes were 
stacked flat on surrounding shelves, 
and some were open face-down on 
the floor! Five steps away were 
tables, and perhaps twenty steps 
away was a can. The table would at 
least be preferable to the floor. Such 
misuse wastes money because 1 
spend more time picking them up, 
and because after such continued 
abuse, the books must be repaired. 

So please, give the entity call 
Helmke library a chance. If you the 
student cannot respect the signs 
which slate something similar to 
"ihese materials are bought by you, 
don't damage your property," the 
don't complain about lack of 
resources

Tim licks his wrist and learns a little 



ByTiraSchreiber 
Leisure writer 

In all honcsiy, I did noi go out on 
thai Friday nighi, which happened 
to be my 21st birthday, intending lo 
gel drunk. Rcaliy. 

I intended to have fun. Maybe 
ihrow down a couple of Screaming 
Orgasms to celebrate life, bui ine- 
Iwiaiion was not my main objcciive. 

Why not, you ask? Isn't that the 
purpose of a 21 si birthday, to load 
up on Liquid Courage and make 
lewd comments to scantily clad 
women in dark banooms, you point 
out? 

Perhaps you would even go so far 
as to say that shallow liquor- 
quaffing hedonism on a person's 
2Ist birthday is tradition. 

Well, maybe. Bui I was on a dif- 
ferent quest that Friday night, which 
happened to be my 21st birthday, A 
more noble quesL A scicnbflc quest. 
A joumalisiic quest. A quest that 
would not involve a conversation 
with Ralph on the big while tele- 
phone, if you get my drift 

I was out to research the bar 
scene, to gather data on the social 
phenomenon known as night clubs. 
I wanted to find the secrets of the 
north amcrican homo sapicn mating 
ritual, as it applies to bars. I wanted 
lo score. Er, I mean, I wanted to 
score some vaJuable Anthropologi- 
cal information. Yeah, that's iL 

And I wanted to report my find- 
ings 10 all of you who are not yet 21 
(or who, like me, are not resourceful 



enough to get a fake ID) so you can 
decide for yourself whether having 
a 21st birthday is worth the bother. 

1 should have known that my 
chances of staying sober that night 
were the same as an ice cube's 
chance in hell. 1 guess the road to 
Bumbling Idiocy is paved with good 
intentions. 

The carnage started at home.

sated in my stomach for the nent IS

wanted to get me drunk, had me do

iigured the remnants of the salt on 
my wrist might come in handy later, 
when I'm trying to pick up babes. 
"Why yes, miss, 1 do happen to 
have some salt on me." 

We went downtown. Our beautiful 
waitress brought me a Long Island 
Iced Tea, and 1 started to nurse it I 
was pacing myself for the long blur- 
ry night ahead. 

After my Long Island Iced Tea 
was safely in my stomach, and 
would soon be (lowing through my 
veins, I had a beer. 1 was following 
an old drinking proverb 1 had 
learned in high school, under the 
tutelage of my good friend Lee: 
Beer before liquor, 

Never sicker. 

Liquor before beer, 

Never fear. 

Having little sense of time, some- 
where along the line I was persuad- 
ed into chugging some beers, 
danced, became intoxicated, tried to 
act sober, tried to hit on the wait- 
ress, went to the bathroom 28 times. 
sang Dylan on the Karoke machine. 
and played some pool- 

My future brother-in-law, Tom, 
and I wagered on a pool game. If he 
won, he got to marry my sister. If 1 
won, I got to sell her to tfie Arabs. 1 
won the first game, but Tom won 
both my sisters back in a double-or- 
nothing re-match. 

I realize that was a very sexist 
diing to do, wagering my sister like 
that. But I think alcohol makes 
primitive the male brain. We can 
discover fire, invent the wheel, and 
write a constitution, but fill us full 
of liquor and we regress back to 
"Hey baby, shake it, don't break iL" 
Thousands of years of evolution are 
lost, not to mention a few brain 
ceUs. 

It's a rather strange past time, 
when you think about it. You con- 
sume large quantities of a liquid that 
slows down your brain. This enables 
you to act stupid without feeling 
stupid. You then entertain everyone 



around you with your wacky antics, 
as if you were in a bad sitcom. Peo- 
ple take advantage of you, pouring 
more of the liquid into your drool- 
ing mouth, to make your brain even 
slower and your antics even wacki- 
er. 

Why do we purposely turn our- 
selves into the village idiot? Maybe 
because it is one funky feeling. 

Also, alcohol is a great source of 
courage. Courage that inspires you 
to say things that you would never 
say if you were sober. Things like. 
"Hey baby, what's yer sign?" or "I 
noticed you undressing me with 
your eyes . . ," And the best thing 
about this form of artificial courage 
is, when you gel slapped, you won't 
feel it. 

As far as the morality of feeling 
funky. I think that everyone should 
have that right. Thai is, until they 
ignore the 12 billion Drunk Driving 
Tragedies that bombard our media, 
and operate anything larger than a 
big wheel when they're full of that 
special liquid. 

Otherwise, my theory is that 
there's no harm in occasionally 
playing ihe village idiot, except for 
maybe the millions of brain cells 
that die slow, agonizing deaths 
while you pay homage to the Great 
Porcelain God. But hey. as long as 
it's your brain cells, and your toilet. 
that's between you and your 
plumber. 

Alas. I did not score much valu- 
able anthropological data on that 
Friday night, which happened to be 
my 21st birthday. I was too involved 
in my shallow liquor-quaffing hedo- 
nism. I didn't even get a date with 
our beautiful waitress. I should have 
offered her some salt 

But I did have fun. I think that 
Bumbling Idiocy is best summed up 
by the cliche, it's a nice place to 
visit, but I wouldn't want to live 
there. 

So, all in all, I would say my 21st 
binliday was a success, and 1 would

THE COMMUNICATOR 



I'll be damned I'm a conservative 



By J, William Richardson 
Copy Editor 

After weelcs of soul-searching, 
looking for new material to present 
to you, I have come across a dis- 
turbing medical finding. I make this 
submission not as a plea for help or 
sympathy but as an expression of 
my introspection. 

I am a conservalive. 

1 am a trickle down believing, 
strong defense supporting, family 
values championing, Rush 
Limbaugh listening, family leave 
and cable bill veto reinforcing, Bush 
voting, abortion rights affirming, 
racial quota despising, Marie Snyder 
loathing, liberal bashing, gun con- 
trol and gay rights opposing, media 
dislnisting, BUI CUnton hating con- 
servative. 

Now, after flnding my true inner 
conservalive self, this presidential 
campaign is making me sick. 

My symptoms began as a slight 
rash that I developed while watch- 
ing the democratic convention. My 
arms began to itch and turn red 
whenever I saw Oinlon or heard the 
media gush over his stance on taxa- 
tion of the rich or his policy on gay 
rights. 

It's not that I don't appreciate the 
contributions of the gay community. 
In fact, I occasionally put on an old 
Elton John record, just like anyone 
else. I just wish the gay community 
(and their rabid supporters. Mark) 
wouldn't be so loud and irritating 
about it. 

But back to my rash. 

You see, it didn't stop there. 

I started watching the evening 
news a little more often. I saw 
democratic chairman Ron Brown 
and got dizzy spells for 36 hours. Al 
Gore gave me severe diarrhea for a 
week. I saw Clinton on C-Span rant- 
ing about upper-class tax hikes and 
spewed my innards. I even got a lit- 
tle queasy watching' Bush stand up 
for his bully buddies on abortion. 

You say, "A conservalive thai sup- 
ports abortion rights?" Of course 1 
do. In fact I support government 
funded abortions. For anybody. For 



free. It's simple economics. Dry 
your sentimental eyes, liberal 
wiener, we're talking money here. 

How much is an abortion these 
days? We're talking dollars here, not 
morality. We'll say $300 (remember, 
we're being conservative). 
Remember who gets abortions. Just 
for the sake of argument, we'll say 
lower-income, less educated indi- 
viduals. 

What is cheaper, a S300 abortion 
or 72.5 years of welfare, food 
stamps, medicare, medicaid, social 
security and police and fire protec- 
tion? Based on economics, the 
choice is clear. 

From the 
Lip 

By J. William Richardson 

Why did I chuck my guts when 
Slick Willy espoused his views on 
taxing die rich to save the rest of us? 
What Robin Hood should probably 
consider is that getting rich is the 
only incentive to run your business 
productively and in an innovative. 
efTicient manner. 

Why should I try lo succeed when 
all my money is pilfered by 
Arkansas Bill and the raiders of the 
lost motivation? 

I'd rather stay home and rest my 
aching conscience, given the choice. 

I should just save my effort and sit 
at home watching "The Price is 
RighL" If the government is going 
to take care of me. regardless of my 
own efforts. I'm going to check out 
the cheap beer and Bob Barker 
scene. That should at least stop the 
advancement of my stress related 
"chronic fatigue syndrome," the 
yuppie disease. 

What did these wealthy individu- 
als do to deserve the derision diey 
receive? Most of die top two percent 
of family income households make 
their money from honest means, just 
like everyone else. 

Either they, or their ancestors, 
worked harder or smarter and suc- 



ceeded where the lazy and stupid 
fail. Should they be denied equal 
protection under the law and taxed 
at a higher rate than everyone else? 
This kind of injustice makes my 
nose run. 

What are our remedies for this 
unfair, discriminaiory practice? We 
need a flat tax, say S6000 per per- 
son, per year, flow's diat for equal! 
What could be fairer than complete 
equality? 

But back to my rash and diarrhea 
and nausea. 

These debates and commercials 
and this campaign diing have really 
thrown some kinks into my health 
care plan. 

I'm going to need socialized medi- 
cine if 1 hear Madonna tell me who 
to vole for again. MTV news is giv- 
ing me a malady quite similar to 
lymc disease. What exactly is verti- 
go, anyway? 

Choose or lose? Choose diis iiash 
and lose my mind. Tabitha Soren 
and the rest of these pseudo-rcport- 
ing dimwits (yes kids, I am ripping 
on Kurt Loder) gave me chills and 
aches and one cold night , extremely 
violent convulsions, 

I am repulsed by their poorly 
veiled liberal attacks on everything 
not fitting their subversive agenda. 

"Rolling Stone" can endorse 
Ointon 'till the cows come home. I 
won't vote for him. I live my life 
trying to avoid being the vapid, 
transparent idiots they lout as heroes 
for the masses. I doubt Axl Rose 
will be voting for Bush. 

The rest of these morons make my 
body hair faU out with dieir drivel. 
In big clumps. My butt is bald like a 
cue ball. And it isn't even 
Halloween, yet. 1 still have a week 
of this lo go. 

Can I get out of class? Can I get in 
to the New England Journal of 
Medicine? I can see it now. My 
name enshrined in the hallowed 
halls of medicine, Post-Traumatic 
Presidential Election Fatigue 
Syndrome. 



I like mine hot and now 



By Jim Walker 
Leisure Boy 

Sometimes we all need lo take it 
easy, to relax a liole and do nothing 
at all. 

I knew 1 needed to take a week off 
after I'd been haunted by hellish 
nightmares of Captain Crunch chas- 
ing me wiLh a hoi sieam iron. 

And he wasn't wearing pants. 

But when it came right down lo it 
1 couldn't take the week completely 
off from my appointed Leisure 
duties. Instead of allowing me to 
continue on with my plan to hang 
out in a lush Columbia City health 
spa and resort, my week ass staff 
called me back to town to write this. 

Yes diey needed me to fill up a lit- 
dc space with someUiing, anything, 
they cried like puny babies. 

So I turned around my white 1976 
New Yorker with electric everything 
and came back to Fort Wayne. 

And here I am typing this Mini- 
Angle Extra. And here I am typing 
about typing. 

How about a Hot and Not list 
kids? 

HOT: Me being in the Ncws- 
Sentinal, Me in general, Joe Carter, 
Bill Clinton, Peter Gabriel, 49rs, 
Nonhem Exposure, the local band 



Jinx, skate board dudes, Russ 
Reklaw, geology, faculty senate, 
Nike Force, gray sweatshirts, and 
word searches from hell. 
COLD: You being in the News- 
Sentinal for a DUl, You in general. 
Mark Lemke. Bush, Peter Wolf, 
Bengals, Jerry Springer Show, the 
local band Ear Lobes, cops in elec- 
tric carts, the naked corpse in 
Reklaw's hotel room, radiology, 
Purdue, Stadias, neon pink sweat- 
shirts, and people who see the 



devil's image in word searches. 

I would like to end this Mini- 
Angle Extra widi a fitting quote or 
anecdote from my twisted and tor- 
mented childhood on the greasy. 
dirty streets of East Chicago, But 
unfonunatcly I grew up in Warsaw 
where the streets are swept by 
machines on a daily basis.

IPFW families suffer from Educare closing 



By Mary Shrock 
Features Editor 

Pat Botes got a letter recently that 
gave him and his wife a shock. 

Educare. a childcare facility that 
is jointly opcraicd by IPFW, Ivy 
Tech and Parkview Hospital, sent a 
letter to Boles telling him that part 
time students would no longer be 
able to use the facility. 

"We got a letter. That was an 
assinine way to lei us know ihey 
were pulling out," Boles said- 
Boles said ihai his biggest con- 
cern is for his children, 

"My two and a half year old 
doesn't have any say. It's not fair 
to her," said Boles. 

Boles received his master's 
degree from IPFW in school 
administration. He works as an 
assistant principal at Kekionga 
Middle School. 

Christine, Boles' wife, is a per- 
sonnel managemcnl student al 



IPFW and works as an accounting 
clerk for National Business 
Systems. 

The Boles' have two children. 
Two and a half year old. Lauren 
and [wo month old, Timmy. 

"Educare is a great place, but the 
way IPFW handled it was all 
wrong," Boles said. 

Boles said that he and his wife 
were just getting everything all set 
for the spring semester but now 
they're going to be forced to find 
aliemalivc child care. 

"Right now I've goi a child who 
goes to one place and ihc other is al 
Educare. It's time IPFW lakes 
some rcsponsiblity for their stu- 
dents and provide child care," said 
Boles. 

According lo Boles, Educare has 
a great program but the way 
they've organized and carried it 
through is ineffecdve. 

"They've got a dynamite facilily. 



but instead of working on that. 
they're going back to square one," 
Boles said. "Educare needs lo 
strengthen their agreement with 
Parkview and get it righL" 

Boles said it's a no win situation 
with Parkview blaming IPFW and 
IPFW blaming Parkview but 
according to Boles they're not the 
ones who gel shafted. 

"It's the kids that suffer," Boles 
said. 

Getting an answer as to why all 
ihis happened, proved to be a tough 
job for Botes, 

"Hdarianne Zimmemian, the dean 
of students, was the only one who 
returned my calls. Everyone else, 
including ihe Chancellor didn't call 
back. Thai's why we're so frusttat- 
cd." Boles said. 

Boles said this has turned his 
whole schedule around. 

"We're just really upset about all 
of this," Boles said.

Foreign Exchange program 
brings students to IPFW 



By Belinda Boothe 

Starr Writer 

Since 1987. IPFW's International 

Foreign Exchange Student program 

has Ijeen helping foreign students 

receive their college education. 

Phillip Kcnnelt, director of 
IntCToational Student Services, said 
the program has added a tot to the 
American students' education as 
well. 

"1 think the program has been 
highly successful," KcnneU said. 

Thae are 124 students represent- 
ing 60 countries in the exchange 
program. 

Kennell said he is in constant con- 
tact with the American Embassies 
and International Instiiutions so that 
the exchange students are constantly 
updated with information about 
IPFW. 

According to Kennell international 
students need to fill three basic 
requirements before being accepted 
lo the exchange program, 

"First, a good academic back- 
ground including college prepamto- 
ry classes is essential," Kennell said, 
"then they must pass an English 
efficiency test and finally they have 
to finance their housing and tuition." 
According to Rajai Suri, student 
body president, "IPFW has become

Suri stud, "My friends recom- 
mended IPFW very highly," He is 
now in his third year at IPFW and 
is studying computer science. 

"Tlie exchange of being here is 
such a wonderful experience for us. 
as well as, the American students," 
said Suri. 

Suri said, "Dr. Kennell is so nice 
lo all of us, IPFW becomes a home 
for us. I'm atrueMasiadon!" 

"IPFW has become a home 
away from home." 
•Rajat Suri 

However, some students involved 
in the exchange program do not feel 
that the program is beneficial to all 
their needs. 

Anne-Therese Delplanque a siu- 
deni from France who hopes lo 
teach French one day said she is dis- 
appointed in the exchange program. 

"It's hard financially. The pro- 
gram didn't find me a famdy to live 
with, do they expect you lo come 
here and find some place to live?" 
Delplanque said. 

According to Delplanque she is 
also ineligible for financial help. 
"I have a student visa, so I 



couldn't get any financial aid. We 
have to pay out of stale fees, so 
we're paying double what the 
American students have to pay." 
Delplanque said. 

But Delplanque added that 
Kennel] has been very helpful to 
her. 

"Dr. Kennell helped me when I 
first came here, getting everything I 
needed." said Delplanque, 

According to Kennell three pro- 
grams stand out as favorites among 
exchange students, Purdue's com- 
puter science and engineering pro- 
grams and Indiana's business pro- 
gram. 

Both ihe business and engineering 
programs are accredited, ihe first by 
the American Assembly of 
Collegiate Schools of Business and 
the latter by the Accnwlitation Board 
of Engineering and Technology. 
Kenneih Johnson, associate dean 
of engineering and technology, said 
accreditation is important for stu- 
dents who might have an interest in 
transferring to another university or 
program. 

"Accreditation facilitates the 
uansfet of programs lo do work 
elsewhere," Johnson said. 



"Education on 
Russia is 
based on so 
many lies. 
American pro- 
Irina Korolenko paganda is 
spreading ter- 
rible information about Russia," 
Korolenko said. 

Korolenko said she is happy she 
can give her students a bener under- 
standing and knowledge of her own 
Russian history. 

"1 like my students. I feel attract- 
ed to ihem and many stay my 
friends forever," Korolcriko said. 

Korolenko studied medicine in 
Paris and wanted to be a doctor like 
her own mother had been. 

Soon she learned that the devasta- 
tion of World War tl would make ii 
difilcult to find work. 

"I was naive. I believed I could 
get a job as a doctor. I switched to 
Russian language just to have a pn&gt;-

Sports outdistance politics in game of life 



BrJoeHeersche 

SpoftsEdJtor 
Participation in sports, bolh as a 
recreaiionaJ outlet and healih t&gt;ene- 
flt, has been on an increase in iec«nt 
years. Meanwhile, voter participa- 
tion in elections has hit all-time 
lows. 

IPFW Sports 
Spotlight 

The Monday night lelevision pro- 
gramming underscored the reason 
this nation has developed an aver- 
sion to politics and increased its 
interest in qnns. 

First, the final presidential debate 
of the 1993 election aired, followed 
by the Pittsburgh Sleelers pitied 
against the Cincinnati Bengals in the 
Monday Night Football matchup. 

In the debate, over and over. 
President Bush would cite studies 
that showed Governor Clinton's 
home stale of Arlcansas was c(Hitin- 
ually at the bottom of lists of eco- 
nomic perfonnance. 

Clinion would reply with other 
studies showing Arkansas' econom- 
ic growth near the top of the lists. 
And Ross Perot would chime in that 
it really didn't matter. 

President Bush would then charge 
Clinion with avoiding the draft. 
Peroi would again chime in that it 
didn't matter, and Clinton responded 
with vague answers, 



Other exchanges saw Perot charge 
Bush with aiding Iraq very close to 
the outbreak of the Gulf War, and 
Bush would respond with, "Show 
me proof," 

Miscellaneous exchanges similar 
to these left the viewers, who ore 
also the voters, with numerous vari- 
ations of facts and figures, and in 
some cases none to decipher. 

Fast forward lo the Steclers and 
Bengals game and a different sce- 
nario is played out. The facts and 
figures no longer lie, and they 
become nearly impossible to distort 
into pre-conceived notions of per- 
formance. 

During the football game, each 
team has just four downs to move 
the ball ten yards, and the Held is 
100 yards long. Both teams score 
si;i points for a touchdown, one 
point for a point after touchdown 
kick and three points for a field 
goal. 

Each team must cross the othen' 
goal line to score points and at the 
end every point is totaled to choose 
the winner. 

In presidential elections, every 
vote is not tallied, but only the ones 
of the electoral college. 

Similarly, if a running back gains 
100 yards and scores two touch- 
downs, he has a good game. 
ContiBsl thai to a presidential debate 
where political pundits claim victo- 
ry for their candidates no matter 
what ihe perfonnance.

and politics also exist wjihin the 
lealm of personal participation. 

When a marathon runner runs ten 
miles per day, or a basketball player 
shoots 100 free throws per day a 
significant increase in performance 
can be noted. 

But when this same atiileie votes 
in elections, the bloated bureaucracy 
of career politicians financed by 
PAC funds, gains no performance. 

Every athlete likes a challenge, 
which is why many people still do 
vote, be it bcgrudgingly and sec- 
ondary to sports. 

Presidents gel elected, serve their 
country, and are duly noted in histo- 
ry books. Some of these men start 
wars, escalate them and win or lose 
them. A few die in oSicc, are assas- 
sinated and impeached. There are 
presidents that develop socialist 
economic programs, others that 
serve during recessions, stan them 
or bring the country back into fiscal 
glory. 

The topic that seems to be primary 
in this election is the economy. 
Whether we are in a recession or 
just a temporary slowdown. 

However, the country has been in 
many recessions, a couple of 
depressions and times of exponen- 
tial economic growth, no matter 
what sports have been around. 

In slowdowns and recessions, we 
watch professional football on tele- 
vision or shoot baskets at the local 
park with a slick, bald rubber bas- 
ketball on a goal wiUi no net. 

When times arc good we pack the 
skis and head lo Vail, Colorado for 
some downhill skiing or maybe lake 
a baseball game in at Wrigley Field. 

The Slaying power of sports is a 
credit to the consistency it provides 
its participants and the goals attain- 
able at the personal level. 

Politics, under the influence of 
people witii many different agendas, 
fluctuates with each election.

and eleven losses, with one win and 
seven of these losses in Great Lakes

Head coach Sandy Le« attributes 
this season's performance on a 
young leam. "We had quite a few 
freshman on the team." Lee said. 

However, Lee points out that the 
freshman on the team contributed 
substantially to ihc victories. 

Cathy Dunwiddie, the numtwr two 
singles playcx, netted a 44 record in 
GLVC play in her freshman season. 

Likewise, Heather Pcrzanowski, 
who played number one and number
