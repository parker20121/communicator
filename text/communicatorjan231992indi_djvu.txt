IPFW athletics affected by 
new NCAA regulations 



By Jim Walker 
Editor in Chief 

The NCAA is toughening up 
on academic requirements for 
studenl-athleies, and the changes 
will affect IPFW's sports 
programs, according to David 
Fairchild, compliance-co- 
ordinator for the NCAA at 
IPFW. 

A new baich of NCAA 
regulations was passed earlier 
this month with the biggest news 
from the convention being the 
changes in freshman eligibility 
requirements. For NCAA 
Division I schools, freshmen 
must have a minimum 2,5 grade- 
point average and a minimum 
700 on the SAT or a minimum 
2.0 grade-point average and a 
minimum 900 on the SAT. 

The new requirements will take 
the place of the current 2.0 and 
700 SAT guidelines in 1994. 

The updated freshman 
eligibility requirements will 
impact IPFW's NCAA Division 
II teams in a different way. 
according to Fairchild. He said 
freshman athletes at Division II 
schools will be required to have 



at least a 2,5 grade-point average 
upon admission. The old 
requirement was a minimum 2.0 
average. Fairchild noted that the 
tougher grade-point average will 
^so be figured over 13 academic 
units instead of the former II 
unit setup. 

Academic units are defined as 
certain required classes student 

"Anything that trys to 
upgrade education is a 
step in the right direction 
for our country. " 

-Amie Bait 

athletes are supposed to take 
during high school. 

Fairchild said d]e new 2.5 GPA 
requirement was the only new 
NCAA rule that would have 
much impact on IPFW's athletic 
programs. He said that most of 
the new rules, there are over a 
hundred, deal with football 
programs and tjiher Division I 
issues unrelated to our school. 
"We do have a number that 
apply to IPFW but won't have 
much of an impact." Fairchild 



said. 

"The changes don't have much 
impact on IPFW because our 
programs tend lo recruit students 
who are academically solid." 
Fairchild said. 

The biggest changes will come 
for athletes who arc currently in 
secondary schools, according lo 
Fairchild, "Athletes will have to 
make more of an effort while 
they are in high school." he said. 

IPFW's athletic director Amie 
Ball doesn't seem upset with the 
changes. "Anything that Irys lo 
upgrade education is a step in 
(he right direction for our 
country." he said. 

Ball also said he didn't see the 
1994 changes making big waves 
in IPFW athletics. "It won't hurt 
recTijiting a great deal," he said. 
"It will have an impact on the 
walk-ons, who we depend on a 
lot because they won't have the 
same guidance during high 
school that the recruited athlete 
has."

Volleyball's Final Four coming 
to IPFW in 1994 



By Joe Heersche 
Sports Editor 

IPFW has been selected lo host 
the 1994 NCAA Men's 
Volleyball Tournament by the 
NCAA Executive Committee. 
Concessions were made in the 
scheduling to allow IPFW a 
chance lo host Ibc loumamcnt 
during Fort Wayne's 
bicentennial celebration. 

It will be the second time in six 
years Fort Wayne has hosted the 
tournament, with the first in 
1988. The strong stippori of the 
local community during the 
1988 loumamcni nearly set an 



attendance record, with 11,444 
fans present during two nights of 
play. With this amount of 
interest the Executive 
Commiiicc prompted by the 
NCAA Men's Volleyball 
Committee, were not as hesitant 
lo nominate and accept Fort 
Wayne as the site in 1994. 

IPFW coach, Arnie Ball, 
believes his team will have a 
good chance of being in the 
Final Four in 1994 with the 
strength of Ihe underclassmen 
now on the team and two more 
years of collegiate playing 
experience. LLoy Ball and 



Norman Almodovar will both be 
seniors, along with transfer 
student Andy Handcock. who 
will have lo sit out ibc 1992 
sea.son. Felipe Ralat and Craig 
Colins will be juniors. 

With Ihe granting of the 

loumamcnt to IPFW, Ihc stature 
of Ihe men's volleyball program 
has been enhanced and will 
contribute to recruiting quality 
players in the future, according 
to Ball. 

The loumamcnt will be held at 
the Memorial Coliseum on May 
6 and 7. 1994. 



forwarded through proper 
channels. 

Legislative Vice President John 
Weisenbcrger and Frazier-Henry 
both spoke lo the senators on 
amending to their duties. 

Weisenbcrger stressed that the 
senate "must sel goals for itself." 
He went on to remind committee 
members that the committees 
were required to meet this week. 

Frazier-Henry took a sterner 
lone, decrying Ihe lack of 
activity she has seen on the part 
of the student government She 



stressed that each member of the 
IPSGA should be working 
several hours to serve the student 
body. 

"If they (student senators) don'l 
have the time. Uien they really 
ouught to re-examine their 
priorities," siad Frazier-Henry. 

After the meeting. Barger 
decried the measures taken 
against her, asking. "How can 
you hold impeachment 
proceedings with twenty appeals 
pending, concerning impeach- 
ment, since November 30." said 
Barger.

your mind. Walk band in band, 
for tbc truth is marching on," he 




said.

important person in history. I 
had the opportunity to meet Dr. 
King when I was in high school 
and he is one of the people I 
fashion my bfe after."

Snyder moves on to 
IPFW after life 



During his time in student government, 
Mark Snyder played several roles. He was a 
name among the nameless mass of IPFW 
students. He was an eye opener. He was an 
alienator. He was a living conversation 
piece. He was a great story. 

But Snyder was never a politician, a par- 
liamentarian, a diplomat or a representative. 
He wasn't made for those parts. Snyder's not 
about that stuIT. Mark Snyder and the politi- 
cal machine mix like water and oil. 

To be a positive part of student govern- 
ment, Snyder needed lo bend. He wouldn't. 
To keep student government going some- 
where, Snyder ni;eded lo give, he wouldn't. 

Sometimes elected officials need to kiss 
ass. Snyder said nix on that. 

Last month, Snyder realized he was out of 
place in IPFW's sitjdent government So he 
resigned. He may have been on his way out 
sooner or later as he was waiting in limbo 
for an impeachment trial. In November, Sny- 
der was charged with several rule violations 
by student government's internal affairs 
committee. Last spring, Snyder was also 
charged for impeachment. He was never 
'^tded. He avoided this year's.irial by resign- 
;lng. 

"I've always tended to be outside fighting 
the system. But some people suggested that I 
try fighting from within the system. It didn't 
work," Snyder told The Communicator last 
week. Why didn't it work? Snyder didn't 
belong inside the system. He didn't fit. 

Snyder was very unpopular with Uie cur- 
rent group of IPF\V students serving in gov- 
ernment. Part of this was his own fault. He 
made life diSicuIt by aeatlng issues out of 



trivial things. He slowed student government 
meetings with his drawn out speeches. The 
other people in student government hated 
that stuff. 

Last week John Wiesenburger, vice presi- 
dent of legislature, told The Communicator 
that student government meetings were 
moving along better now that Snyder is 
gone. 

Wiesenburger is one of the many people 
in student government happy to see Snyder 
gone. "Snyder has done so much harm to the 
credibility of senate that it's going lo take a 
while to work through it," Wiesenburger 
said. 

Snyder was also disliked by the others in 
government because he did too much, Sny- 
der wrote too much legislation. He brought 
up too many resolutions. He talked too 
much. These were (tequeni complaints from 
the student government office. It can't really 
be wrong to do too much. But it sure can 
piss people off 

That is what it all came down to; Snyder 
pissed everyone off. He was given his own 
little comtnittee, sludefit affairs, where he 
could work exclusively with his only allies - 
Nancy Barger and Sally Green. Snyder was 
not a real part of the student government 
puzzle. Everybody was pissed at him so 
whatever he did seemed to work against 
them. So they got together and tried to 
impeach him. 

But before that could happen. Snyder 
wised up. "I resigned because 1 felt like a 
hypocrite. I was always attacking student 
government while I was still part of it. It 



Frazier-Henry speaks 
on ISPGA 'chaos' 



By Kristina Frazler-Henry 
IPSGA President 

For the past 18 months. IPSGA has experi- 
enced a lot of inner turmoil. Tliis internal 
conflict bogged down the process of accom- 
plishing anything positive. Senate meetings 
became unbearable. 

I am sure that the average student did not 
understand why senators spent 20 minutes 
arguing about a motion or rule. Since July, 
almost every senate meeting has lasted over 
two hours. At the Jan. 19 meeting, senate 
was in session for less than an hour. 

During the seven years that I have attended 
IPFW, IPSGA has always suffered internal 
conflict. Sometimes it has been between 
branches and other times it has been 
between individual members. Usually, these 
conflicts were over ideas for events or legis- 
lation. IPSGA members, because of the 
cohesivencss of the group, were able to work 
out some sort of a compromise. 

Why. then, has there been so much chaos in 
IPSGA lately? What has taken place over 
the past 18 months is a deterioration of 
teamwork and group morale. Watching your 
back became a daily ritual in the IPSGA 
offices. If you did not resign, you fought 
tooth and nail lo accomplish something. 

Many IPSGA members have been criti- 
cized by Mark Snyder for playing the uni- 
versity's game. The trulh is that we have 
always tried to work within whatever guide- 
lines IPFW administration has set up. If 
working through the system failed (a rarity), 
then we tried other avenues. 

IPFW faculty, staff and administrators are 
not a bunch of evil beings out lo get stu- 



dents. I truly believe that most of them want 
to enrich our educational experience. 

Where does IPSGA go firom here? IPSGA 
feels strongly about erasing the negativity 
that has been created by previous members. 

Tills semester, we will be informing the 
IPFW community about IPSGA events and 
happenings. Most of these events and iiap- 
penings were going on last semester but 
were buried under impeachment hearings 
and letters to the editor. 

Second, senate meetings will now be held 
during a time when students can attend 
them. Vice President Weisenburger will be 
announcing the meeting dale and time this 
week. As always, the student senaie wel- 
comes anyone from the IPFW community to 
attend and offer their input. 

Fmally, IPSGA will return to the business 
of programming events and wriUng legisla- 
tion for the students of IPFW. 

In next week's issue of The Communicator, 
I will further explain IPSGA's goals for the 
spring semester. Also included will be the 
goals of the executive branch, judicial 
branch, legislative branch and programming 
branch (SAB). All branches play an impor- 
tant part in IPSGA. 

IPSGA will be meeting on Sunday. Jan. 26 
at 7:30 p.m. in the Walb Memorial Union 
ballroom, Ai this meeting. I will be 
announcing the goals IPSGA will be 
addressing for the spring semesler. All are 
welcome and urged to attend. 

The opinions expressed by Frazier-Henry 
are her own and do not necessarily represent 
those of The Commtmicator. 




Lehers To The Editor 



Barger demands student presence Sunday 



To the Editor: 

I would like to invite all 
members of the student body 
to my impeachment trial on 
Sunday Jan. 25 at 6:30 p,m, 
in the Walb Memorial Union 
Ballroom, See your sludent 
government in action. 'Virtu- 
ally the only action they 
have managed in the last 



tlu-ee months. 

While the intention of 
internal affairs was to run a 
secret meeting, state law 
mandates public access 
because of the salaries paid 
to IPSGA members by Pur- 
due-a state entity. 

Common sense mandates 



an open meeting because 
these are the paid rcprcsenta- 
lives of the student body tak- 
ing action that affects the 
student body. Further, I, as 
the sole remaining defen- 
dant, insist on an open 
forum. 

For your further entcriain- 
ment and enlightenment an 



IPSGA meeting follows the 
impeachment. 

Student government 
spends a $.25 million of your 
money annually. It might 
prove interesting to look at 
" where and how the funds are 
distributed.

Student disgruntled over missing IDS 



To the Editor: 

As a journalism transfer 
student from Indiana Uni- 
versity, I am an avid reader 
of the Indiana Daily Student, 
Indiana University is known 
nation wide for their superb 
journalism department. The 
I.D,S. excels in annual com- 
petitions. 



Due to budget cuts IPFW 
chose to cross the LD.S, off 
its subscription list. Purdue's 
Exponent remains on the 
library's second floor, along 
with numerous foreign 
newspapers. 

Why does a branch of one 
of the nation's top journal- 
ism colleges refuse to 



receive its own newspaper? 
Perhaps the director of 
Helmke Library could give 

us an answer. 

It seems like IPFW's stu- 
dents will have to petition 
for a right which should be 
considered a tradition of this 
campus. Take a moment to 
write a written complaint lo 



the director of Helmke 
Library;,-' Larry Griffin and 

drop it off at the circulation 
desk. Maybe then what has 
been a tradition in Bloom- 
ington will remain a tradi- 
tion in Fort Wayne.

Snyder blasts IPFW police protection 



To the Editor: 

This university's adminis- 
tration would have you 
believe that it is concerned 
for your health and well- 
being. This is a lie if the 
administration is to be 
judged by its actions rather 
than its words. 

While it is true that this 
university has committed 
hundreds upon thousands of 
dollars to a "wellness" pro- 
gram which might more 
appropriately belong to a 
YMCA or YWCA, and has, 
in the interest of our cotlec- 
tive "health," negated the 
civil liberties of thousands 
of members of this commu- 
nity through its policy on 
smoking. 

It is also true that this uni- 
versity has allowed the 
department of Police and 
Safety to deteriorate to a 
level of staffing which is 
criminally negligent. 

Last year I wrote a letter to 
the editor of ihis newspaper 
calling your aitcntion to the 
fact that this university's 
department of Police and 
Safety was approximately 
20 percent below its budget- 
ed level of staffing. 

Today the situation has 
deteriorated even further, 
and has, I might suggest, 
reached a crisis level. 

The department of Police 
and Safety is budgeted for 
12 commissioned police 
officers and six security 
officers. As I write this let- 
ter, the department has sev- 
en police officers and two 
security officers on its pay- 



roll. 

Of the seven police offi- 
cers, one is in training at the 
police academy (and will be 
until April), while yet 
another is relegated to 
administrative duties by 
virtue of his rank as a 
sergeant. 

As a result, this university 
has willingly allowed its 
Police and Safety to fall to 
only 38 percent of its 
strength. To put this in 
another perspective, the cily 
of Fort Wayne has approxi- 
mately one police officer for 
every 500 citizens, and the 
citizens of this community 
are screaming for more 
police. 

This campus has one 
police officer for every 
2,000 individuals. Addi- 
tionally, this university has 
yet to fill the position of 
police chief which was 
vacated last November. 

1 am outraged! Not only 
am I outraged that this Uni- 
versity holds the personal 
safety of its members in 
such total and criminal dis- 
regard, but that it falls upon 
a student to bring this matter 
to light. 

Where is the faculty at this 
University? Are these 
"scholars" so isolated in 
their search for pedantic 
truth that they ignore the 
reality of their environment 
or do they simply not give a 
damn? 

Come on professors, prac- 
tice what you preach in your 
classrooms, We need your 
help not simply your theory 



and rhetoric. 

We are not safe on this 
campus. Our sons and 
daughters are not safe on 
this campus. Our depart- 
ment of Police and Safety is 
in a shambles and its offi- 
cers demoralized. 

This university has shown 
itself to be unwilling to take 
those actions necessary to 
reasonably guarantee our 
safety. Are we going to 
simply do nothing until 
more students are raped or 
someone is killed? Or do 
we demand that this univer- 
sity honor its obligations to 
its members and take imme- 
diate steps to rectify this sit- 
uation? 

I would call on every stu- 
dent to make their outrage 
known to this university, I 
would suggest that every 
parent contact this universi- 
ty and make it well known 
that their sons and daughters 
will not attend Ihis campus 
until their safety can be 
assured. 

I would ask the city of Fort 
Wayne to demand that 
immediate steps are taken to 
safeguard its citizens. 

And, I am challenging 
every faculty member to 
insist, individually and 
through its senate, that this 
university's administration 
rectify this deplorable situa- 
tion at once. 

We can wriie letters to this 
newspaper, the trustees of 
this university, to this uni- 
versity's administration and 
we can raise this issue in 
our classes. 



The alternative is to 
remain silent and through 
our silence be victimized. 
Finally, I would encourage 
this newspaper to investi- 
gate this situation and report 
its findings on these pages. 
If we all work together we 
will be heard, 

1 am not unaware that 
there are some among the 
faculty, staff, and students at 
this campus who would 
question the credibility of 
this writer. To those indi- 
viduals I would say that if I 
am un-credible, your apathy 
is incredible. 

However, before you dis- 
miss this letter and its con- 
tents as simply "more of 
Snyder's ravings," please 
check these facts yourself. 
This issue is far too serious 
lo be disregarded because of 
personal politics. 

Finally, to my university I 
say the following; This stu- 
dent holds you personally 
responsible for the safety of 
each member of this aca- 
demic community. Your 
failure lo take those steps 
necessary to reasonably 
assure this protection is, in 
and of itself, a violation of 
your stated policies and 
obligations. 

As such you will be held 
civilly liable. This situation 
must be rectified at once by 
any means available. Let us 
hope that we can do so by 
working together peaceably 
as it gets quite noisy at bar- 
ricades,

THE COMMl]^aCATOR 



Landon walks in the night 



ByJimWolker 
Editor in Chief 

Somelimes I jusl sit up aJl night, 
glassy^cyed, walching paid program- 
ing on cable television. 

"Why?" you may ask, prying rudely 
inlo the dark side of my personal life. 
"Why?" I'll tell you why buddy, if you 
must know. I'm beni, cracked, broken. 
I'm damaged merchandise, alright? 
Now you got the story, Is thai good 
enough for you? Does il make you feel 
big to sec mc like this? Huh? 

Excuse mc. Can 1 borrow a tissue? 

Well anyway, I thought since I'm 
often awake al terrible times like 4;35 
a.m., I'd share with you, ihe attentive 
reader, what's on cable at tbai lime of 
the morning. Let me tell you people, 
you're in for quite a ireai! 

First, let's set the scene. Close your 
eyes and imagine if you will a dimly lit 
living room with a sagging plaid couch 
and a blinking television set. 

Okay, open your eyes again so you 
can continue reading this! On the sag- 
ging plaid couch I sit eating Miracle 
Whip from the jar with a spoon. As I 
snack on this tasty treat I'm clicking 
through the many, many cable chan- 
nels. 

CLICK - On the USA Network 
there's a program- length conmicrcial 
for the Hair Club for Men. In the 
show, new-hair boy, BiL, flaunts how 
worry free he is now with bis chem 
locks. Bill works as a fireman (fake 
hair is no more flammable than real 
, hair). Bill rides his motorcycle (his 
wig doesn't fly off onto somebody's 
windshield). Bill does some scuba div- 
ing (the glue that holds his hair dov^'n 
isn't water soluable). And Bill even 
pracdccs karate (bis hair stays on even 
after repeated blows to the head). 

Needless to say, I'm impressed 
enough to order some hair, so I reach 
over to the cordless phone and dial 1- 
800-GET-CHlCKS. After I answer a 
scries of questions over the phone the 
operator hangs up on me. She told me 
I was not insecure enough to join the 
Hair Club for Men and to quit wasting 
her lime- 
When I turn back to the show, there 
are a bunch of clients sitting together 
in a litUe padded group therapy room. 
Tbey are telling their hair success sto- 
ries. 

'I felt like 1 was leading a sheltered 
life for a long time," noted a client 
with a pelt of curly brown hair on top 
of his head. 

"It only look one or two looks from 
20-year-old girls to let me know this 
was it," said another cUeni wili a pelt 
of curly brown bail on the top of his 
head: 

"If I get rejected now at least 1 know 
it's an honest rejection - not just 
because of my hair," another guy with 
a pell of curly brown hair said. 

1 swear I didn't make that stuff up! 
It sure seemed odd that all of the guys 
in the Hair Ciub for Men group thera- 
py had the exact same hair, 

CLICK - On VHl there's one of 



those dam Soloflex marathon commer- 
cials. I personally blame lie jerks at 
Soloflex for killing cable television. 
Solodcx was the innovator of the long 
paid programing shows thai bore mil- 
lions to death each night. 

CLICK - Switching to the Discov- 
ery Channel it's Rick Dees hawking 
the Time-Life Rock and Roll Era 
music collection. I read somewhere 
that watching Rick Dees for an extend- 
ed period of time is much more stress- 
ful to the human body than the acnial 
Soloflex workouL 

CLICK- On A &amp;E, it's a "Gold by 
Ihe Inch" promotional commercial. 
"Now you can set up a booth at your 
local mall or shopping center. No spe- 
cial skills are needed, just the desire lo 

make money 

and lots '

Club for Men hair, I can tell! 

CLICK - Wow. it's the "Love Boat" 
on WON. Eric Estrada is playing a 
lounge singer who falls in love with 

Mackenzie Phillips. Jan Brady is there. 
Gary Collins and Patty Duke are pair- 
ing off in Ihe Captain's Cove. Yuck! 
Patty Duke is wearing a tube top. 

CLICK - Katby Smith's Fat Burning 
System is on the Nashville Network, 
"Lose weight and gain confidence, and 
you'll learn you can do anything you 
want." Kalhy Smidi lies. 

CLICK - On Lifetime, Cher host's 
"Focus on Beauty." Cher's litde show 
is hawking some hair products. "Here 
Cher smell this. Here Cher let me rub 
this into you." says Lori Davis the cre- 
ator of the products. She looks like 
SamKinison. 

CLICK, CLICK. CLICK - A cou- 
ple channels are selling juice 
machines. Another is pushing the Air- 
cutler. I switch back to the soft and 
familiar voice of Kathy Smiih and ber 
fai burning. I slump over soon on the 
plaid couch. I'm floating in an ether 



sea. Such peace I haven't known in a 
long while. 

But wait, who's that walking up to 
me? Hair Ciub president and client Sy 
Spcriing has an Airculter in his hand. 
He's after my hair! Oh my gosh! I grab 
the empty jar of Miracle Whip and 
throw it at Sy. He's gone. 

Well, I'm cenainly glad that's over, I 
drift back lo sleep. A few minutes later 
I'm awakened again by Mike, the guy 
who hosts "Amazing Discoveries." 
There's a crowd of people behind him, 

"Would you like to see how the 
Sharpie Special Knife Set works on 
human flesh?" The crowd cheers. 
Mike smiles as he leans over mc with a 
big serrated butcher knife. I see my 
own blood squirt onto Mike's very bad 
sweater. Then he's gone. I wasn't really 
cut 

I fall into slumber again. Soon I 
wake lo the music from "Litde House 
on Ihe Prairie," Tlie ghost of Michael 
Landon is in my crummy living room. 

"Where there's a will [here's an A," 
Landon screams in obvious reference 
to my latest grade report I'm shaking 
now, 

"Where there's a will there's an A," 
Landon shrieks again. 

I wake up sweating. A nightmare? I 
look at the television. Ron. the owner 
of Ronco is pushing his food dehydra- 
lor. I get up and switch off the cable 
box. 

"Mr. Landon." I whimper looking 
up a my light fixture filled with dead 
bugs. "1 promise to go to class and do 
my homework and pay more attention 
lo school than I do Kathy Smith and 
her burning fat." 

Suddenly the television pops back 
on. Filling the screen is Landon's 
"Highway to Heaven." As the opening 
credits roll Michael stops and looks 
through die TV tube at me. "Way to 
go!" he says.

Hyde thinks over Gulf War 



By Dan Hyde 

StaffWriter 

The war in ihe gulf was noihing 
more than a fart This is not a value 
judgement; simply a melancholy 
facL 

One year and one week have lapsed 
since Ihe January 15. 1991 deadline 
for the Iraqi wilhdniwal from Kuwait 
and the beginning of conflict. 
Enough lime has passed lo forgcl the 
particulars but nol enough to call it 
history. 

The sccni is still in the air, so lo 
speak. In any event Ihis near 
anniversary is all the reason I need lo 
cut some facls loose from their prop- 
er place in history, round them off 
and set them free. 



I'm really not concerned whether 
the^ facts have anything to do with 
the Persian Gulf or not, so don'l you 
be cither. 

Did you know... 

That a Union soldier in ihc civil 
war had ihc greatest chance of being 
mortally wounded, one is six. The 
Persian Gulf vets had ihe besi chance 
of survival. 

Only one in every 2500 lost his 
life. The next besl odds were in 
Vietnam; one in every 151. 

Approximately 25% of all combat 
casualties in the gulf were die result 
of friendly fire, 

Henry David Thoreau's last words: 
"Moose... Indian... - 

The last words hcird by Abraham 



Lincoln were from ihc Play "Our 
American Cousin." spoken by and 
aclor named Asa Trenchard. 

World War 1 was Ihe first U.S. war 
where ihe deaths due to combat 
exceeded death by disease. 

Paul Revere, famous American 
Pauioi, was once court mariialed for 
cowardice. He was cleared on all 
charges but never lived down Ihe 
scandal. 

John Wilkes Booth was the greatest 
matinee idol of his era. 

Both Thomas Jefferson and James 
Polk died from diarrhea 

Thai's all the space for me so I will 
leave you with Ihc words of Stalin "a 
single death is a tragedy, a million 
deaths is a statistic."

Center serves as diversified, alternative theater 



By Samh Jnkacky 
Fealurcs Editor 

Dolby sicrco surround sound, a clean 
ihcater, and a variety of altcmaiivc 
films of "cxiremely high qualily" arc 
all pari of ihe Cinema Center, says 
Geoff Gcphari. cxceuiivc dirccior of 
ibe ibcalcr. 

The nol- for- profit organiiation ran ii.s 
first film series 16 years ago. 1( w.is 
started by a group of people wanting lo 
bring independent movies to tin. 
public. 

The theater, until this past Octolxf. 
moved around a lot and did not havi.- j 
permanent home. Gephart feels ih.ii 
since the Cinema Center now ha.s a 
permanent location on East Berry 
Street, it will fmally begin lo grow and 
expand its audience. 

Gephart says, "The center exists lo 
show alternative films amj 
independently made films." He adds 
that Utc material consists of foreign 
films with subtitles, classic movies, 
documentaries, and contemporary 
fitois. 

"There are no big lime Hollywood 
stars," explains Gephart, "because 
those films are commercially 
profitable." 

However, Gephan says that the films 
featured at the Cinema Center are 
written better and have better acting 
than more commercialized films 
because the movies arc more well 
thought out. 

"The people that make these 
alternative films have a high artistic 
vision." 

Gephart says that the alternative 
fihns are basically low budget projects. 
"Other big studios waste money on a 
lot of bype. special effects, and big 
actors that don't necessarily come 



ibroughfor liiem." 

Because the Cinema Center doc5 not 
patronize big studio productions. 
Gephart feels that it is important to 
remember, "films arc art, not 
entertainment.* 

Part of what makes good artistic 




films, according to Gephan, is a good 
crew that works together toward a 
common goal. 

"Most of these alternative films have 
a unique, fresh approach with 
interesting lighting and camera angles. 
Most have good acting and present the 
subject matter in a way that will make 
you see it in a new way." 

According to Gephart, the Cinema 
Center runs four series per year. Each 
series consists of about 15 shows over 
thrce months, he says. Each film runs 
for four days, Thursday through 
Sunday. 

A committee, which is made up of 
Cinema Center board members, meets

periodically to discuss potential films, 
he says. They hear about most of the 
films from press releases, film 
festivals, and movie catalogs. The 
origins range from national to 
worldwide. 

Although the Cinema Center rarely 
fills the 141-scat theater, Gephart is 
hopeful that public support will grow. 

"Right now most of our patrons arc 
well-educated professionals, or young 
college students. Most are interested 
in culture and art. also," Gephart adds. 

Gephart says that advertising and 
funding arc a problem. "Right now a 
majority of our funds come from ticket 
and concession sales, grant support 
from government and private sources, 
corporate support, and private 
donations." 

Because of the need for funds, the 
Cinema Center is a small theater. The 
film screen is 19' by 9'. On the other 
hand, Gephart says that the Cinema 
Center is the cleanest theater. "We 
even have a janitorial service to clean 
up after shows." He also says tliai a 
special feature of Cinema Center is Ihe 
dolby stereo surround sound, which 
puts the audience in the same 
environment as the movie characters. 

Most imporumtly, Gephart says the 
the success of the theater relies on the 
benefits of the Cinema Center. 

Bessie Makris, a film researcher for 
Cinema Center, says, "1 wouldn't be 
involved if I didn't think it was great. 
There is no other art program in 
Indiana like it" 

Makris says that people are reluctant 
to see alternative films because they 



.ire "more demanding than something 
like Terminator 2 or The Addams 
Family." 

Agreeing with Gephart, Makris says 
that alternative films are important 
bcicusc of lie quality . She adds that 
the Cinema Center "has done fantastic 
things." 

Makris adds, "Film is important, 
especiially foreign films." She says 
that it is unfortunate that T.V. and 
home videos arc the easy way out for 
too many viewers. 

The films at Cinema Center are not 
as well known among college students, 
but we're trying to change that," 
Makris explains. 

She recalls a lime when Ihe 
alternative film audience consisted 
almost entirely of college students. 
Makris feels that we should go back to 
independent films because of the 
cultural benefits. 



Makris adds. "If wc can get more in we will have a bcuer understanding of 
touch with the diversity of our cultures each other."

lessly opened a I6-point lead, 62-46, 
with 12:40 left in the game. The 
Belles were led by Ail-American 
senior, Sharonda O'Bannon, who had 
10 points in the first seven minutes of 
the h;ilf, and freshman, Calhy Drawn- 
er, who had 1 1 in the span including 
three direc- pointers. 

The Lady 'Dons forced a turnover 
and on the ne:(l posscs.sion Miller was 
fouled on a drive on the baseline. She 
bit both free throws to cut die lead by 
two, 69-67, at the 7:22 mark. 

The team exchanged turnovers before 
O'Bannon hit a layup only to be 
answered by Miller's short jumper. 
When 1PF\V forced another turnover 
O'Bannon fouled Miller, In the result- 
ing tangle, 03annon injured her ankle 
and left the game. There were six min- 
utes left in the contest. 

The Lady 'Dons turned the ball over 
on the resulting possession but Menicr 
stole it back, feeding Miller who 
dished to Sands for a layup. Sand's 
shot, at the 5:32 mark, tied the game 
forthc first time at71. 

The Lady 'Don defense held and 
Miller dished to Edwards who hit a 
short jumpcrjusl inside the foul line to 
tie the game at 78 at the 1:37 mark, 

McGIone responded with a layup. 
After an IPFW lime oul,_the Lady 
"Dons worked the ball into Edwards 
who bit an eighl-foot baseline jumper 
10 make 80-80 with 47 seconds 



remaining. 

Bellarminc brought die ball up-court 
against the IPFW pressure slowly and 
lost the chance to win when Miller and 
Sands trapped, with Sands forcing Ihe 
jump-ball. IPFAV was awarded posses- 
sion and Menicr dumped the ball from 
die top of Ihe key to Miller on the right 
baseline for the winning layup. 

"1 see my role as the point on the 
press," said Sands after die game. "I 
don't care so much about scoring 
points. I just knew 1 had to get my 
hand on the ball." 

Bellarmine's coach, Charlie Just, was 
visibly drained following the emodon- 
ally-charged contest. 

"Well," he said, sagging against (he 
wall outside the gymnasium. "I 
expected it to be a lough game. 
They're a good team. We had them on 
the ropes a couple of limes but they 
just kepi coming back. We just hop 
we're up with them at Ihe end of the 
season." 

Drawncr, a freshman, led the Belles 

with 18 points. 

IPFW was led by Miller's 29 poinLs 
which included 1 1 of 19 from die fioor 
and seven of eight from the free-throw 
line. She also had a game-high 10 
rebounds, passed out five assists, and 
had iwo steals. 

The Lady 'Dons played short-handed 
because of injuries to sophomore 
Michelle Conley and freshman Jamie 



LaRuc. Edwards, Menier, and Miller 
all played the entire 40 minutes while 
Sands was in for 35. 

Two days after fighting tooth and nail 
for a victory IPFW found itself on the 
good end of a blow-out. 

Kentucky Slate University brought a 
team struggling through a season of 
adversity into the Adiletic Center. The 
Thorobrcites have only one victory and 
are wlnless in die GLVC Ihe season. 
They have never beaten the Lady 
'Dons. 

IPFW jumped to an 8-1 lead with less 
than two minutes gone in die game as 
Sands hit three straight jumpers when 
Ihe Lady 'Dons' pressure created a 
steal, a travel, and a blocked shot. 

Kentucky Slate hung in the game and 
was down by just four, 17-13, wiih 
13:19 remaining in die half. 

Miller took a pass from Sands at ihc 
12:52 mark and hit a short Jump-shol 
and then, 30 seconds later, Menier 
stole the ball and fed Miller for a 
layup. The Lady 'Dons never looked 
back out scoring Kennicky Stale 33-10 
from thai point lo lake a 54-23 half- 
time lead.

Vaughn returns 

By Joe Heersche 
Spom Editor 

The IPF\V Men's Baskeiball team 
has become a more mulli-facetcd 
team wiih the return of senior guard 
Eric Vaughn. 

Vaughn adds a new dimension lo 
the Maslodon's scoring prowess 
with his ihrce-poini shooting. 

Many speciacors, along with 
opposing coaches and players, arc 
skeptical to sec Vaughn set up and 
launch a shot five or eight feel 
behind tiie diree-point line, and then 
watch in amazement as the ball sails 
efforllcssly through ihe net, 

III the past three games Vaughn 
has sunk 15 three-point shots on 25 
attempts. In a recent interview 
Vaughn issued a warning to naysay- 
ers of his ihree-poim shooting effi- 
ciency. "Anywhere I set up and 
shoot from, 1 know ihat ibe distant 
is within mv range," said Vaughn. 



IPFW SPORTS 
SPOTLIGHT 



The IPFW offense is lurtncr assist- 
ed by Vaughn's "no-look" passes 
like those Magic Johnson patented 
in his playing days as a Laker. 
According lo Vaughn, passing is 
one part of his game he has spent 
much of his lime perfecting. 

Defensively, Vaughn's hustle 
reflects his desire lo give 150 per- 
cent in every game he plays. 
Vaughn says he also demands a lot 
from his leaiiunaics which elevates 
the play of the team. Widi this type 
of leadership lhat is not measured in 
points scored, or rebounds grabbed, 
Vaughn has become a team leader. 

Vaughn's leadership on the basket- 
ball court has developed through 
years of playing experience. As a 
high school player at Saginaw Val- 
ley Lutheran in Michigan, Vaughn 
was recognized by twice being 
named to the AU-Siate team. 

Much of his leadership skills 
Vaughn attributes to his mother who 
U a school teacher and leader in the 
community, he says. 

Wiih a year off school, Vaughn 
has had time to sharpen his basket- 
ball skills and prioriiize his college 
studies. Playing baskeiball after 
college may or may not he in 
Vaughn's future, but he is confident 
coaching and sports announcing will 
be.
