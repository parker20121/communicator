Park is located about 227 miles 
south of Fort Wayne on the Ohio 
River. The park asked a survey 
team from IPFW to complete

Robert McCullough, a profes 
here at IPFW of 5 years, conclude 
that the ruins were used as a 
kitchen for preparing 



food. The ; 
Indian tribes would gather 
nuts and use large grinding 
slabs weighing around 661bs, to 
smash the nuts and using a fire, 
boil them to extract oils used to 
maintain life during the colder 
months. The site contains many

McCullough explains that the 
preserved nutshells have been 
tested dating back to around 
2,000 B.C. and have been 
confirmed as hickory nuts. The 
site he mentioned would not 
contain any bones due to the 



the dirt of which the ruins were 
found. He comments, 'This is 
a big piece of history and it 
is well preserved." The ruins 
were well preserved because 
they were buried under about 
four feet of silt, produced by 

erosion of both the water and 
outside weathering conditions

Pastor Scott Watters were both there to 
talk about the Christian religion. Callen 
is a staff worker at IPFW's Intervarsity 
Christian Fellowship. Callen said that 
although God has been a part of her life 
since she was a child, she is still on her 
journey to finding truth. 

"The meeting held by the SPSA was 
a great opportunity to hear about many 
different religions and share ourpersonal 
faith experiences," said Callen. 

"Kudos to SPSA for a great event, and 
kudos to those of you students who are 
brave enough to continue the search for 
real truth." 

Watters talked about his childhood, 



saying that he never was involved in th 
churili until one day he was moved t 
read the Bible. 

The Christian religion focuses on th 
belief of lesus Christ .is the savior of th 
world. Their religious text is the Bible-, 
book written by men inspired by God.

Another man's 
TREASUE 



By Brianna Belford 

bbelford@ipfwcommunicator.org 

The story is simple: an American solider 
is sent overseas. Whfle he is there he 
writes and calls home as often as possible. 
Within a month his money is gone due to 
the large sums of money spent on phone 
cards and collect calls home. 

When thirteen -year- old Brittany and 
her twelve-year-old brother Robbie of 
Massachusetts heard of one such story 
they took their piggy bank and snack 
money, a total of $21.00, to their local 
bank to open an account. They wanted to 
find a way to help the soldiers who needed 
financial assistance to call home. With 
a $500 donation from the South Shore 
Savings Bank of Hanover the children were 
able to start up Cell Phones for Soldiers. 

As of right now the goal for Cell Phones 
for Soldiers is to supply the troops with 
refillable prepaid calling cards. Their 
ultimate goal is to provide a bank of 
satellite phones and video phones to be 
used across random drop-off sites. 

Cell Phones for Soldiers has local ties 
with Liberty Tax Service. Although the 
start up non-profit had media spots on 



Montel, MSNBC, The Tony Danza 
Show, and Teen People they still 
needed to get the word out 
the general public. Liberty 
Tax Service heard of the 
charity and decided 
to collect donated cell 
phones in their offices 
nationwide to help. For 
every cell phone collected 
100 minutes of calling 
is paid for. 

According to Ken Anthon, 
supervisor at Liberty Tax Services, 
over 47,000 cell phi 
collected by Liberty Tax Services 
nationwide. In northeast Indiana 
there are seven locations where cell 
phones can be dropped off. 

According to a 2002 study b 
environmental research group 
Inform, the United States will 
throw away around 130 million 
cell phones. 

"We offer a chance for 
people to make a difference

Currently the Indiana Department of Natural

the Site will be handled. IPFW's survey team is 
planning to present a bid as soon as the DNR 



will explain the details of what the team will be 
searching for and trying to uncover as well as the 
methods they may use in doing so. During this 
phase the team will produce further conclusive 
research about the site and provide data as well as 
written reports about their findings. McCullough 
mentions that if given the bid, the team plans to 
be back down in Clark County this spring. 

Along with this site the Archaeological Survey

working with. They hope to be adding this new 
site to their list. A full list can be viewed at

Deny the aliens American money 



Wells-Fargo has begun to 
give loans to illegal immigrants. 
Instead of needing a social 
security card to approve the 
loan, the bank isonly requesting 
the Mexican driver's license and 
their matricula card. 

The United States Treasury 
approved accepting the 
matricula card in 2001. 

Wells-Fargo is not the only 
company doing this. Verizon 



OIH'V that

U.S. 



Sprint Corp., and Blue Cross 
of California, an insurance 
company, also accept the 
matricula card. 

Wells-Fargo openly admits 
that they know a majority of 
the bank accounts opened by 
a matricula cards are opened 
by illegal immigrants. By doing 
this, Wells-Fargo and the other 
companies are authorizing

the proper credentials to open 

How can people, who aren't 
supposed to be in America in 
the first place, be allowed loans 
and approval for other things 
to help them get ahead in the 
United States? 

There needs to be more 

prevent things like this from 
happening. 

Sure, illegal immigrants 
come here and take jobs that 
other Americans do not want. 
But, even legal immigrants are 



willing to take those jobs. 

There would be no problem 
if immigrants would come over 
legally. 

Instead, nobody knows how 
to speak English and there is 
confusion at the workplace 
with true Americans who don't 
know Spanish. 

We wonder, how we can Find 
and deport illegal immigrants; 
well, here isour way. Wells-Fargo 
has lists of illegal immigrant's 
addresses who have provided 
the matricula card. 

Now, with these lists, the 
government can step in and try 
to take control of the problem. 
The government should use 
these addresses to track the 
illegal immigrants, which would 
help solve the problem our 
government had with enforcing 
the law. 



Irresponsible democracy fails 



Screaming from the Left

Now, in a stunning and terrible

They are calling it a revolution by

It is a tricky sou pliirtoreign powers

the siated goal of our nation. On the 
other hand, this is tin free voice of the

However, the people ot Palestine

But football, while the centerpiece, is not the thing 
on everyone's mind as Sunday rolls around. And by 
no means will football get your SuperBowl party 
jumpstarled right. 

What will? Well, the food of course. 

The weekend is about so much more, it is about 
the sport, the pagentry of the entertainment event 
and especially the social environment. But again, 
what makes most social occassions so good? That's 
right, again it is the food. 

Every Sunday throughout the season, people 

nationwide roll out of their

But hey, SuperBowl Sunday is

Instead, SuperBowl Sunday 
offers all Americans the 
chance to party right with 
great foods. So what is the 
perfect SuperBowl party 
dish? Well that is debatable depending on the person that 
you meet. But the right dish could do wonders. 

"Shrimp is the best SuperBowl food," said junior Mark 
Robinson. "It is a favorite food of mine and when I had my 
first SuperBowl party a year ago, it was a must have." 

In a small poll conducted on campus, finger foods were 
found as an overwhelming favorite for SuperBowl parties 
or even small get togethers. Ranging from pizza rolls to 
potatoe skills to the aformentioned shrimp, one out of 
every three student polled said that some type of finger 
food was a must have for the Super Bowl. 33 percent of 
those polled also enjoyed nice home cooked meals.

Album Review 



Featured on the independent Paper Garden 
Records, Nebraska's [^e.te'Seagull has recently 
been labeled by the Lincoln Journal Star as 
"Band of the Year," and "an eclectic, pop rock 
contradiction." One should expect that seven, 
local indie-rockers being given such a high 
praise would have to be quite brilliant in their 
musical odyssey However, to use a word such as 
"hrilliant" would he a grave understatement. 

Setting a vibe that follows throughout the self- 
titled album, the disc kicks off with the dreamy, 
chamber-pop-esque "Lock and Key," which 
escalates into an almost psychedelic-trance. 
"Photograph" creates that traditional steady and 




picks up with a misleading title, giving the listener 
a choppy, but cheery, piano-laden melody. The 
latter portion of the album changes little pace 
from the prior songs, yet has a remarkable closing 
tune, featuring a streaming sound of fireworks 
set underneath a familiar haunting piano verse, 
which we have become so comfortable with on 
E'S' debut. 

Eli Mardock's vocals and lyrics are often 
dark but promising. To compare, they are very 
reminiscent of Conor Oberst - the creative genius 
behind the Bright Eyes vehicle, or even the late 
let I Hu&lt;_kk'\ I he I isiener builds

Requiem, the 
2nd celebration 
of artist Mozart 



Music is a dipstick by which to identify a 
composer: it gives his name, his era, his style and 
his age. Last Saturday's Fort Wayne Philharmonic 
concert was a perfect example of this. 

The concert opened with Mozart's Symphony 
No. 20 in E-flat major, K.133. This piece is one 
of Mozart's earlier works, and the listener can 
tell this not only by the low Kerschel number 
(Mozart went all the way to K. 626) but also by 
the overall sound of the symphony. This classical 
work is carefree, a frolic of the instruments. 
Although the four movements are broken into 
orderly pans, the piece never assumes a somber, 
weighty tone, unlike several of Mozart's later 
works. Rather, this symphony is a blithe nod at 
music that expresses the youthful exuberance 
of the 16-year-old composer. In such a vein was 
it [irrioiiueil ,n the Hiibassv, and as such it was 
accepted by the audience. 

Intermission was prolonged due to lack 
of power for the organ. A cord had been left 
unplugged. Following the delay, the Philharmonic 
was joined by the Fort Wayne Philharmonic 
Chorus, the Goshen College Chamber Choir 
and four soloists (soprano Amy Cofield, mezzo- 
soprano Jessye Wright, tenor Robert Bracey and 
bass John Shuffle) for Mozart's Requiem, K.626. 

This piece is Mo/urt's last expression, it covers 
everything. In it, one can hear the desperation 
of a man who was able to complete only one 
lis death. It holds the joy of 
teaven. It has the absolute 
; running stricdy on nerves, 
desperate to survive. And it holds the peace of
