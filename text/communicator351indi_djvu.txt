students, we are faced widi 
many choices. We must choose

our majors. Should we pursue 
graduate studies or maybe try lo 
find the perfcci job now? 

These are important choic- 
es, as they will impact our lives 
in very major ways. However, 
in Ihe fall of 20{X). we arc facing 
another very imponant choice. I 
am speaking aboiil Ihe choice 
presented lo us in Ihe upcoming 
November election. First, wc 
have the choice of whedier or 
not to vote. Do I vole? Should I 

If so. whom do 1 vole for? 
Green Pany, Reform Parly. 
Socialist Parly, Independent 
Party, Democrat or Republican

In Ihe past mondi. wc have been

Democratic National 
Convcnti

nels. We are (old to "Choose or 
Lose" on MTV and faced with 
"Indecision 2000" on the least 
likely of poliiical venues, die 
Comedy Channel. Should we 
perhaps just blow this all off 
and conrinue widi our sludics? 



Pany. I will focus or 



We have all known a poinl in 
lime where one of our political 
leaders has made a wrong deci- 
sion, enabled or vetoed a con- 
lrovei3ial bill or ignored an 
issue all together. Somelimes 
we arc lefl scratching our head 
wondering. Will these candi- 
dates stand up and work for die 
causes for which we elect Ihem? 
Arc diey willing to sacrifice lhc 
good of Ihe one in order lo sat- 
isfy die good of ihe many? 

Our primary candidates 
are George W. Bush (R) from 
Texas and Albert Gore Jr. (D) 
from Tennessee. When it comes 
10 Ihe issues, these candidates 
are worlds apan. On the issue 
of taies. Gore is an advocate for 
child ta^ credits and the Earned 
Income Credit. Bush faces die 
same issue with a promise lo 

According to Governor Bush's 
olTicial platform. "Govemmenl 
cannot tailor its programs lo the 
needs of each family. The best 
way to help all families is to let 
each family keep more of lis 
income - and spend il as it 
deems appropriale.' 

Anodier issue facing us is 
gun canuol. Gore makes no 
bones aboul his stance in gun 
control. As a suong advocate, 
he has been on the from line of 
the Brady Bill, which causes 
polemial gun buyers to undergo 
a background check (and a one- 
week mandaloiy wailing peri- 
od) before purchasing a firearm. 
This seems like a good idea. 
considering the violence that 
has occurred in Ihe Uniled 
Slates during the ClintOn/Coie 
admintslmtion. We firsi experi- 
enced lerrorism and violence in 
New York City On Feb. 26,

quickly laking over ihe gam* 

have come a long way since [he 
CO days of two decades ago They have 
games Ihai could barely mimic the 
;nms malch to games that can almost 
perfecily recreiie Ihe rush of bungce jumping off a 
dam. Now games have Iheir own liiilc worlds, seem- 
ingly bif gcr than our own world, but in icalily, no big- 
ger than D liiilc microchip. These worlds come fully 
equipped with their own sorts of creatures, landscapes 
and populations in which characters cTusIomized by the 
vanaus players ctplore. hoping lo obtain rare and 
needed ilems. as well as complete different quests. 
Theu online games come equipped with chal engines 
thai allow players to talk back and farlh lo each other 
as though Ihey were having a conversation. This helps 
players ally wiih each other ot lum against each other. 

latcs real life. 



I where which can all be played either offline or on servers 
as they sitch as Ballle.neL There are also games such as 
fear of Ultima Online and EverQuesl that are piimaiily online 
I could games in which the player must pay a mondily fee in 
or U'ade order to play the game. These games seem more real- 
istic andean have thousands of people playing on each 

amount of people on these games at a lime can be 
jlaggenng. 

Despite the bonuses for gamers in having very 
detailed and intense games that simulate reality very 
elUcienlly, there are many negaiive aspects lo these 
games. The fiisland most obvious do'"nsidc is the fad 
that, tor games such as EvecQucsl and Ifllima Online, 
there is a continuous charge for game play. Though ihe 
rates may not seem that much by themselves {under 
SIO per month), over a shon period of time, the 
amount of money spent is a little more ihan what a 
new game by Itself would cost. There is also Ihe fact 
that a lot of the software used in these games call for 
the very best in hardware such as 3D video cards, 
lightning- fast processors and top-of-lhe-line sound 
cards. In order lo play, however, one must pay. 

Another downside to these games is their addic- 
tive qualities. With a large world for ciplomtion. Iols 
of side things to da such as fishing and hunting and 
wilh difTicult tasks for the players lo complelc. the 
game can become loo dillicult to quit. Throw in 
human interaction via in-game chat with other players 
and the time a player will spend online will compound 
as he or she gets more and more into the game anii 
more and more detached from everything else. The 
addictive nature of these games can be very bad for 
those who play ihcm. 

Many people are overlooking these points, 
however, as online iniecaclivc games are taking over 
the gaming industry. By providing users with eiciling. 
no consequence places to aid them in their escape 
liable, each from their own mundane realities, the software com- 
aie making millions of dollars while making 
u o( people happy around Ihe world.

The 2000 Lady

year Head Coach Kcllcy 
Hartley who had a 24-S over- 
all mark and a 17-1 GLVC 
record, allowing her team to 
finish in second place m the 
GLVC. 

With Just two seniors on 
this year's rosier, this young. 
but etperienced group of 
players is ready to mike iU 
mark on (he national scene. 

The Lady Volleydons 
learned a greai deal from list 
season's 24-8 campaign. First

tremendous work elhic will

Isch and Douglas are 
iwchlime, First Team All- 
GLVC selecuons. [sch made 
1,422 assists (12.37 per

all-time assists leader with

game) and digs with 421 



compeiiuve individuals." 
Hartley said.' Tim Heffton 

They will out work any- 
one. Tami is the best setter m 
the conference and Laura is a 
player that a lot rests on her 
shoulders." 

The stfength of this 
yeai's team will be its unpre- 
dictability. "We are a team 
thai likes to experiment,' 
Hartley said. 'We need to be a 
little more aggressive." 

'We are glid lo open up 
at home: Charleston is new to 
the region. Every time we 
play, a regional match is very, 
very important. It is much 
more advantageous for us to 
defeai a regional team in 
order to help receive a nation- 
al bid.- said Hartley. 

Her team lost in a three- 
game milch lo 1999 NCAA 
Division II Final-Four con- 
testant Northern Kentucky in 
ihe GLVC Champ lonsliip. 'I 
e:(pect Northern Kentucky lo 
be the team to beat again,* 
Slid Hartley. 

The Lady Volleydons 
suffered the loss of iwo key 
players from !asl season's 



squad. Jodi Schnelker and 
Rachel Brown. Schnelker

Dance/cheerleading team brings fresh start to Gates: seeking recruits 



Hiy 



MUJIilllilBJII 



imer of uncertainty about 

team' performing al IPFW's sporting events 
and the belief from some members of Ihe 
former dance Icam. the Silver Dolls, that 
dance and checrleading are better off being 
separate, the athletics deputmcni has decid- 
ed on a combination of both, IPFW is now 
searching for a maximum of 15 siudenls 
who are able to do both. 

"I am excited about a new opportuni- 
ly and start. This is very important at the 
collegiate level, 1 am happy lo have a com- 
bined program and bring cicilemeni back to 
Gates. This is a biand new start for Ihe ath- 
letic departmenl." said Waller Bowman, 
director of the alhlciics departmenl. 

In the 1999-2000 school year, the uni- 
versity has had some struggles in the area of 
dance and cheerlcadii)g. The new coach and 



also associate faculty of Ihe theater 
menu Briciney Coughlin. has hopes that tne 
new team |yet to be named) becomes a more 
permanent and established part of Ihe 
atmosphere at IPFW's athletic competitions. 
Sin weeks before ihe beginning of 
last school year, IPFW's cheerlcading coach 
resigned. Without a coach, sufficient funds, 
ume lo organize and missing uniforms, the 
■Ihlelici department opted lo go without i 
cheerlcading squad. 

However. Ihe Silver Dolls managed lo 
perform all year for a variety of sporting 
events, despite similar difficulties. Part of 
the reason for ihe lesignauon of the Silver 
Dolls' coach, Kaly Hopkins, was due lo Ihe 
feeling that there was a lack of gnswih. sup- 
port from the administration and funds 
(SSOO for the entire season). Most of Ihe 
Dolls' supplies come from fundraiser? and 
they did nol receive scholarships or college 
credits is many other universily dancers do, 
according lo Hopkins. 

It looks as if ihe new member? of ihe 
cheerlea ding/da nee team won'l have io 



depart- worry about 



forms will be covered. Dancers and cheer- 
leaders will pay for iheir own lights and 
shoes. Coughlin is uncertain if her leom will 
college credi 



cheerlcading or gymnastics. 

The perfoimers have to be ready 1&lt; 
and support the Dons a '

required to practice twice a week. "Hard-

Ihe busiest months of September and 
October. Many rehearsals arc lo be conduct- 
ed on game nights. 

leading combined. It requires someone who 
is a diverse person. Dancing is fluid and 
cheering is sharp," said Coughlin Some 
choreography has already been prepared. 

Coughlin's background qualifications 
are a bachelor's degree in dance perfoim- 
ance and choreography from Hope College 
in Holland. Mich., two years of leaching 
Jazi. ballet and lap al the Nortl^east SchooJ 
of Dance and one year of coaching ihc colnr 



Coughlin said she has many names of 
individuals, including several freshmen 
from area high schools, who have shown 

"1 am looking for people who love to 
be involved and support Ihc school." said 
Coughlin. The produclivily of the team, as 
far as dance camps and compclilions go, 
depends on the ability, opinions and aliiludc 
of Ihe group, according lo Coughlin. 

They may also perform in poradei and 
local events. The future of IPFW having a 
dance team and a cheerlcading team 
depends on commitment and haw the pny 
gram flourishes, said Coughlin.
