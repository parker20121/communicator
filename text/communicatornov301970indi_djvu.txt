However, while he feels the

And on his view, young Black 
people should not have to trade 
their identity or integrity for an 
education. At Malcolm X he 
snid thai the faculty is interest-

they won't be "brainwashed or

Whether you core to ailmit it, all of you arc dupes. You will 
go through 16 years of education and bcconte trapped in a society 
aonie of you claim lo deleBt. Bui obviously there are those of you, 
wbo will stamp your foot in righteous indignity and proclaim this 
is not so. You svill claim this is Americn, land oF the Free and 
home of ihe brave. You will say, this society gives you a chance 
to change its imperfections from within. But how can you change a 
society that for I6 years has bred you, has brainHaahed you. A 
society that has told you its version of right and tvrong, that gave 
you its morals, its ways and its solutions and has showed you vAial 
it wishes you to sec. Just as Hitler pabbed his youth at their 
youngest and taugjit them his way of thinking, our society from 
Kindergarten begins lo shape our minds. It tells us that oil good 
children follow orders implicitly and without a flinch. Tliis society 
has deliberately built in safeguards to continue itself. Hiat 
diplonn you receive alter college is society saying, "You're one 
of us now, boy. Do us proud," To change society after this be- 
comes a monumental task. A task which bluis and becomes unclear 
as wc figjil an inner turmoil within us. In order to change our 
society you must detach yourself from it. You must deprive il o[ 
its living resources, namly yourselves. We must slow and finally 
slop its reproduction of itself. Tliis does not necessarily mean 
violence in fact quite the contrary. TTiere must be a power outside

On The

America has always been a 
growth society. But today an 
organized challenge is being 
mounted against the heart of that 
concept. ZPG stands for Zero 
Population Growth, and its sup- 
portere propose thai the U.S. do 
exactly that: stop jjrowiog. For 
some years, a number of biolo- 
gists, sociologists and even 
some economists have proposed 
population control. Now, on 
dozens of campuses, students 
arc taking it up as a vital new 
cause. Along with some of iheir 
equally worried elders, they bc- 
believe that a constantly in- 
creasing population is responsi- 
ble for many of our problems; 
pollution, violence, loss of 
values and of individual prira- 
cy. Because of America's lofty 
standard of living, 210 million 
of us gobble u| 
than 2.5 bill

any since the Defression, bul 
even at this rate the U.S. would 
double its present population in 
70 years. Most of the younp 
campaigners pledge themseU-es 
to rustricl the size of families 
they soon will have to the ZPG

The Answer 

byE.E. 
For thousands of yeara 
moo has lived upon the earth 
and his human results has been 
virtually nil and there's a 
reason. Because it is a whole 
hell of a lot easier to send a 
man lo the moon than to interact 
between one another: Because 
man bos taken his real humanity 









heap of tcchnolo^, 

his pride to overwhelm all 
other emotions. And he has 
called this man. But beneath 
all this man remains human. 
Potentially he con still reach 
a high plain of human existence 
but only have a tremendous 
social upheaval of awareness. 
Instead of teaching children to 
survive in the world, he must 
be aware of the swarm of hum- 
anity buzzing around him. He 
must be taught existence 
depends on his reachiag out to 
other people. Ilie realm of 
human experience is as vast as 
the universe bul without a 
personal unity involved it is 
frightfully shallow. Because 
Ihe human aspect of ourselvea 
frightens us we turn our backs 
on il, Man is his own wont 
enemy and potentially his 
greatest friend. La\'e is the 
answer and you've heard it all 
a thousand times before. You've 
heard ihat love is total giving 
requiring nothing in relum. Yet 
you stand aghast at war, pov- 
erty, and crirne. Yduj can help 
solve it, merely by stepping oul 
of your own personal closet 
into the mansion of hurranity. 
Would you be willing to give up 
your education to help someone 
else get his? Would you give 
up an easy job and lake up 
VISTA? Your damn right you 
won't. So stop shooting off 
your mouth about the world 
until you 're ready lo do ivhat is 
needed, hit on yoiu- tat ass. 
Techaology or revolution caanol 
save this world. Oily love can 
So get at it or are yoo loo damn 
concerned with your -own shin?

Sheiln Webster, on I U

in the horseback riding world. 
She recently won by ten points 
the Slate Hunter Seat Eijuitotion 
Championship for the third con- 
secutive time. This champion- 
ship is a\vardod on n point basis 
with points given for placing in 
es'ents sanctioned throughout

bined 18 firsts and other places 
in the jumper and hunter phases 
of equitation to win.

Two upset victories high- 
lighted the first round of the 
Flag Football playoffs, ffcr-

bacher (5-2) by a score of 8-0 
on the South field, while

lar fate at the hands of Johanns 
(3-4) as they w^re beatea la-g

often slipped and fell on the 
sloppy field. 

FVesslcy's team scored 
first in their game, but could 
not hold on to the lead. A 
slippery football and very cold 
hands hampered Johanns os they 
had several drives stopped just 
short of a score. When they did 
score, they had to do it twice, 
OS the first was call back. With 
the score tied g-g the gome went 
into overtime. Tlie overtime 
was a short one however, as 
Johanns took the kickoff and 
scored on a breakaway after 
only 3 plays. 

Id the battle of the losers, 
fVesaley was eliminated from 
the playoffs by ffcrling by a 
score of Ig-fi. TTie game was 
tied 6-6 in the first half, but 
fferling finally broke it open 
for two scores in the closing 
minutes to stay in competition. 

Brogao won their garrtt over 
Holley by forfeit.

STUDENT 
DIRECTORY 

The Student Directory 
took time and effort to make. 
It was compiled by S.tudcnt Gov- 
ernment (esp. Norm Crcenburg). 
Also helping was the lU and 
I^rdue data processing, the two 
registrars, and Purdue ADP 
facilities. 

One thousand were printed 
through use of the Campus' copy 
center. The process entailed 
double facing 103 pages into a 
52 page book at a cost of about 
52i a book. 

Approximately 850 have 
been distributed to students, SO 
to faculty and administration 
members, and TP were sold to 
the bookstore at Sl.OO each. 
Distrubution was free lo acti* 
vity card holders, while others 
were charged from Jl-OO to 
S5.00. 

Tlie only problem run into 
with the listing was that FW- 
due listings were not updated 
from the time some students 
had originally ' entered the 
school, TlierefrH^, some were 
outdated. 

Funds for the Directory 
came from the Student Activ-
