University adopts 25-year 



plan for updating campus 



North side of IPFW 
| to be showcased; 
roads, safety 
priorities 



Sophomore Jeremy Perth" finishes a project for his drafting communications 
class. 



by Rebecca Koenig 
Chief Reporter 

Tuesday, IPFW admin- 
istrators met with 
local contractors to 
discuss the IPFW 
Campus Master Plan. The con- 
ference proposed to make a 
number of structural changes 
affecting students 

The draft is still flexible, 
according Eton Karter, director 
of the physical plant, but is 
neanng its final stages. Some 



have expressed doubt about the 
feasibility of the plan which 
would lake 25 years to com- 
plete, but according to Katler 
25 years ago many doubled that 
IPFW would accomplish what 
it has today. 

The plan calls for several 
new buildings and roads, and 
offers a solution for parking 
problems on campus 

The Engineering Tech- 
nology Building, the Life 
Sciences Resource Center and 
Helmke Library will all be 



expanded, allotting more space 
for additional students An 
addition to Walb Union and 
Gates Sports Center will join 
tbe two buildings, creating a 
social area where students can 
gather in warm weather. 

The university intends to 
expand Walb on the north side 
in an attempt to attract more 
interest in Walb Union 
According to contractor Deane 
Rundell of Rundell, Emstbetger 
&amp; Associates, the Master Plan 
will have a group of buildings 
serving as an arts center. 

Along with the addition of 
other buildings in that area, the 
north side of the campus will be 
more developed, making Walb 
Union more centralized, and 
should increase the conve- 
nience of Walb. 

Revamping IPFW roads will 
be a priority according to the 
Master Plan. The roadway pro- 
posal will minimize pedestrian 
traffic through automobile 
paths. This measure should 
improve campus pedestrian 
safely. 



Another safely n 
be introduced are circle drives 
instead of slop signs. This 
change is expected to relieve 
traffic backup. The circle 
drives will allow traffic to con- 
tinually move, although at a 
slower space. According to 
Rundell, though traffic will 
technically be moving more 
slowly, it should reduce traffic 
jams, thus decreasing time 
spent driving across campus. 

According lo (be Master 
Plan most of IPFW's roads 
would be routed around the out- 
skirts of the campus Having 
the roads surrounding the cam- 
pus was planned lo augment 
ihe new parking situauon. 

Instead of having several 
parking lots covering the cam- 
pus, four parking garages will 
be available. The garages will 
be located at the perimeters of 
the campus, surrounding the

Gerald Houseman, profes- 
sor of political science, has 
announced bis decision to 
enter the race for ihe 4th 
District Congressional seat, 
currently held by Republican 
Mark Souder. 

Houseman said be believes 
there is a great crisis in this 
country which is threatening 
Americans' traditional sense 
of caring He said this cata- 
strophe extends to our chil- 
dren, working people, the 
elderly and the standard of 
living. 

Houseman said Congress is 
trying to make education more 
expensive. He said it will be 

much harder to be a student 

and also to receive financial 
aid. 

"The excuse for all of this is a balanced bud- 
get, bui the real goal is a tax break for the priv- 



"The 

country 

needs a 

positive 

vision" 

-- Houseman 



ileged," said Houseman. 

According 10 Houseman, the effect of the 
Republican agenda would cause education to 
become out of reach for many more people than 
in the past. 

Although he said he had never planned to 
run for Congress, Houseman said his disagree- 
ment with the Republican agenda has caused 
him to change his mind. 

The country needs a positive vision anc 

needs to protect its jobs and standard of living, 

according to Houseman In order 

lo accomplish this, Houseman 

said, a strong emphasis must be 
put on research and develop- 
ment, education, and a strong 
stance must be taken on world 
trade 

According to Houseman, the 
country needs a balanced bud- 
get, but he said we cannot forget 
to preserve the heritage of 
America's strength and generos- 
ity while doing so. 

Bob Polston, Houseman's 
campaign manager, said Ihe pro- 
fessor will serve as an "excellent 
altem alive" 10 Souder 

Polslon said Houseman's 

character and capabilities are 
Ihe backbone to his candidacy. 
"Anything he puis his mind to, he can 
accomplish." said Polston.

Commentary 



Speaking up: the 
best Christmas ever 



by Joe Grim 
Guest Columnist 

Now thai we're in the midst of 
the holidays with Christmas fast 
approaching, it's lime to get ready. 
Let's see... I still need to buy some- 
thing for mom, dad. Bob, Julie, 
Grandm.i Heloise and Great Aunt 
Ethel. The tree isn't up yet, so 1 
need to go out and trudge through 
the snow for hours with the family 
until find "just the right one." Oh 
yes, I need to write cards to all of 
my friends and relatives — most of 
whom I have not seen in years. 
Then there is the shopping and dri- 
ving, as well as the eager task of 
buying blank video tapes to record 
the seemingly endless bowl games, 

I am sure most of you can relate 
to my situation, as the holidays are 
a very busy and hectic lime for 
everyone There's so much to do 
and so liltle lime in which lo do it. 
As if ihe holidays weren't crazy 
enough, television and radio bom- 
bards us with the usual ads: "If you 
jusi buy this radio for your loved 
one, it will be the best Christmas 
ever!" Everywhere you turn there 
are bright lights flashing and frantic 
people hurrying. 

Wailing in lines at the depart- 
ment stores enables you to see thai 
most of the other customers are not 
in the festive spirit With the excep- 



tion of the parents who are scream- 
ing al their overly excited children, 
most people have blank looks on 
their faces. Their eyes say "Let's 
just gel this over with!" 

Afier seeing all of this rush and 
commotion, one may begin (o won- 
der if THIS is really worth it. My 
answer is an absolute NO. In this 
increasingly materialistic age, the 
original meaning of Christmas has 
been lost. Christmas used to be a 
lime when families joined together 
to form lasting memories, and lo 
celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ. 
But the I990's Christmas means 
everyone sits in the living room. 
with ihe women trading recipes. Ihe 
men staring at the blaring television 
watching football games, and the 
children whining about not getting 
to watch "Rudolph, the Red-Nosed 
Reindeer" — who has replaced the 
donkey in every nativity scene — 
again. 

It has reached a point where we 
all need lo stop, shut off the televi- 
sion, pull the family together and 
talk, sing carols, and read ihe origi- 
nal Christmas story from the Bible 
We need to get together, away from 
the hustle and bustle, and remem- 
ber how much we appreciate those 
we love... and tell them so Maybe 
if we (you) did, we'd truly have the 
greatest Christmas ever. 



Even gay barrel 
contains some bad apples 



I used to think 
that gays were the 
most open-minded 
species God creat- 
ed. Why shouldn't 
they be? We are 
looked- down on by 
most churches, 
families and gov- 
ernments If any 
kind of person 
should be the most 
accepting when it 
comes lo ihe different makes of 
humans, it should be gays. 

I'm wrong. 

I have recently come across a 
new breed of gay: The Gay Racist 
To me, that sounds as absurd as 
The Gay Republican, bul sure 
enough, they exist. There is a les- 
son 1 have learned from this: 
People are who ihey arc and cannot 
be changed. 

This is an important lesson 
when dealing with a homophobic 
society. In the past three years, I 
have come across a white gay who 
used racial slurs as ofien as be

tainted with beliefs of other social 
biases? I started to feel like a lelc-

as I do!" (see Jimmy Swaggert) 

So what now? Do I just accept 
that homophobes and racists will 
always be and become an environ-

truly believe the work that has been

made more progress than if the

arc seen as the respectful, deserv-

culture aims to achieve. 

This also makes me think about 
those individuals who are gay and 
black, and often women. As a 
white gay male. I can tell you this

Me Review 

Scorsese, Stone show off 
talents in 'Casino' 



by Paul Tupptrr 

M..ii.n:i"r (Alitor 

What do you do when you wani 
10 spite up an already successful 
mix of a director and iwo Academy 
Award winning actors? If you are 
Martin Scorsese, you add Sharon 
Stone 

Wilb "Casino." Scorsese has 
done jusi that Robert De Niro 
(Oscar for "Raging Boll") and Joe 
Pcsci (Oscar for "Goodfellas") 
have a chemisiry wilh Scorsese. 
paralleling no oLher team. To keep 
ihe boys from getting lazy. 
Scorsese auditioned and gave Stone 
a chunky role as Ace's (De Niro) 
wife Ginger Sione proves lhal she 
can play in the boys club wiihoul 
getting hurt 

Good performances are nolhing 
new from De Niro and Pesci. 
Seeing "Mary Shelly's 
Frankenstein" should be enough to 
witness De Niro's mastery Pesci 
has the ability to turn a real 
stinker — sec "The Super" or 
"Jimmy Hollywood" — into a 
decent performance. But it is Stone 
who deserves a standing ovation. 

Her role as money-hungry, drug- 
thirsty Ginger steals the show. If I 
were to sec more performances 
from Stone of this caliber, 1 may 
soon forget she was in "Sliver " 
She makes her character strong yet 
vulnerable. And she makes steel- 
hearted Ace become softhearted in 
her presence . 

Ace and Nicky (Pesci) narrate 
the story. Ace is a professional race 
horse gambler with an impeccable 
talent for predicting — wilh precise 
calculation— the outcome of the 
races When the local underground 
bosses want to score in Las Vegas, 



they send Ace to ran a fixed casino 

Nicky, a childhood friend of 
Ace, follows Ace in an attempt to 
keep an eye on him for the bosses. 
Nicky is a miniature bully who uses 
extreme violence to protect his 
friends After years of being in the 
shadow of Ace. Nicky sees Las 
Vegas as a chance to come into his 
own spotlight and rale the city. 

Ace can do no wrong until the 
media focuses on his past wilh bad 
news Nicky At this same time, Ace 
begins to lose control of his wife 
Ginger, who has never goticn over 
her love for ihe user, Lester (well 
played by James Woods) This is 
only time Ihe film gets weak, coin- 
eidenially when we see less of ihe 
actual casino Then it is Stone 10 
ihe rescue again, using sex wilh 
Nicky to gain sympathy for her 
troubled life with Ace. 

The big crime fails and everyone 
must pay ihe price. The movie. 
already extremely violent, gets 
more so wilh Nicky witnessing the 
bat-beaten death of his brother. 

Scorsese's influence is demon- 
strated throughout the movie. Ii is a 
style 1 didn't caich onto until "The 
Age of Innocence." Almost 
Hitchcock-like, Scorsese uses light- 
ing to slowly focus in on what he 
wants ihe viewer lo see as impor- 
tant. He also uses mise-cn-sccne to 
create moods. When the screen 
shows ihe money-counting room of 
the casino, you know it is a cold 
place by the silver walls and stain- 
less steel tables. 

This movie accomplished two 
things with me: 1 am an even big- 
ger fan of Martin Scorsese and a 
believer in the untapped talents of 
Sharon Stone. 



Rockabilly a fresh, fun alternative 



by Janet Tobey Other tunes 

Features Editor they play 

include Stray 

Just because rockabilly started in Cats' "Rock 



the 1950"s. doesn't mean it is now 
only appreciated by old farts at ihe 
Moose Lodge. Young people who 
go to see The Blue Moon Boys gel 
lo experience an energy-filled per- 
formance that may surprise them, 
No moldy oldies here. 

"People who haven't seen us 
play assume that we are an 'Elvis' 
band," said lead singer Nic Presley 
"We do some Elvis songs, bui we 
get crazier on-siage lhan Elvis ever 
would have done." 

Presley, who looks like a young 
Elvis, constantly keeps the crowd's 
attention with bis antics, whether he 
is doing pelvic gyrations or climb- 
ing on any available horizon tal sur- 
face. 

"We have a really high-energy 
show. Young people really dig us." 
said drummer Dave Lemish, who is 
a sophomore at IPFW and is major- 
ing in music education. 

"People from our generation 
often don't know what rockabilly is 
because they haven't been exposed 
toil," said Lemish. 

The drummer himself was unfa- 
miliar with the genre until the day 
Ihe Blue Moon Boys needed a 
drummer for a gig lhat night 

"The first time I sat in with the 
band. 1 just knew thai rockabilly 
was based on jazz and blues. So I 
played a swing pattern and put a 
back beat on two and four." said 
Lemish. 

The Blue Moon Boys hired the 
drummer that nighl. Since then. 
Lemish has come to appreciate the 
rockabilly style, describing it as all 
about feeling good. 

"It's one of the happiesl kinds of 
music that I know." said Lemish. 

The band covers some early 
recordings of Elvis, such as "That's 
all Right Momma" and "Baby. 
Let's Play House."

Fesfi 



in Fort Wayne 




by Amanda M union 
SUIT Writer 

The "Season of Good Will" sometimes seems to bring out the worst in 
as. We run around the malls like rats in a maze, competing for the one and 
only open parking ipacc complaining al every turn as we bleed our bank 
accounts dry Here are some hints on bow to get back to holiday basics. 

Ho, ho, ho With the holidays cometh the jolly 
fat man Santa Claus officially arrives at LPFW 
on Dec. 9 al 9 a. m. in the Walb Ballroom 
Venture forth and tell Santa what is on your wish list this 
year. SAB is sponsoring a "Breakfast with Santa " If you '. 

feel too mature to visit Santa and are looking for an ~ " 

excuse, bring along a kid Tickets (children $4. adults S3. 50) are available 
until Friday. Dec. fi 

Orchestration Fort Wayne is abounding in holiday music this year. 
The Fori Wayne Philharmonic will present its Holiday Pops con- 
cert once again on Dec. 8 and 9 and also a performance of 
Handel's "Messiah" on Dec 16 and 17 Other musical productions arc 
occurring all around town during this month. Be on the listen. 

Lighting the way Now is the time of year when your neighborhood 
street begins to resemble an airport landing strip more and more 
with each passing day Yup, ii is definitely the holiday season Hop 
in the car with your own band of cronies and cruise the city streets, oohing 
and ahing at the decorated homes This is especially fun with the carols 
blaring on the car stereo. If you're looking to make the ride a little unique, 
award those awe-inspiring or nausea-inspiring homes with a few quick 
honks of the horn. 

■PFW"s William's Theater will be home to 
"The Best Christinas Pageant Ever" until Dec. 
10. The comedy tells the story of a married 
couple who ariempl to put on a Christmas pageant. 
despite the fact thai they must cast the Herdman kids, 
described as "the meanest, nastiest, most inventively awful 
kids in the history of the world." Purdue-Indiana Thealer 
and the Fort Wayne Youlheater present this holiday 
favorite. Tickets are available for $5. 

Dance of the Sugarplum Fairies. Until Dec 10, the Fort Wayne 
Ballet and the Fort Wayne Philharmonic will present the classic 
ballet "The Nutcracker " Attend this production and fall asleep 
later that night with dances of Sugarplum Fairies in your head. 

Angels. Snow must blanket the ground for this one. otherwise 
things could get quile messy Snow permitting though, fall back, 
wave those arms and create your own heavenly art 
work Snowball fights, skiing, sledding and hot chocolate 
in the lodge are other added bonuses to the deal when 
mother nature decides to cover the ground in a frosty 
blanket. 



&gt;tep 1 1 



You, your family and friends. Amid the 
craziness of the season, take a moment to step 
back and look at what really matters: the close- 
ness and love that can exist between people that we sometimes take for 

granted 



It's the thought that counts 



by Janet Tobey 
Features Editor 

I called a friend the other day to 
tell bim what I would get him for 
Christmas, if I could 

"It's a camcorder with a variable 
speed zoom lens, inpod and remote 
control," I said. 

That's what I would get him, as I 
said, if t could He recognized the 
intention, and since it is the thought 
that counts, he thanked me for my 
gift 

As it happens, 1 may be giving 
everyone refrigerator magnets 
this year. Then again. I always 
find a way to give presents on 
Christmas. The point is, it 
doesn't really matter what 
you get someone for 
Christmas, as long as it is 
not fruitcake. (Does any- 
one really eat that stuff?) 



Too many people focus on the 

wrong things around the holidays 

They worry about how their lives 

are going and whether or not they 

will appear successful enough when 

they go to visit the family 

Worrying about how to finance the 

extravagant gifts they feel 

they must buy only adds 

to the problem. 

The real Grinch 
that steals Christmas 
is that part of our- 
selves thai worries 
we are not getting 
enough from life 
and focuses on 
our own short- 
comings. If a 
search for the 
perfect gift 
turns into a 
fret-session. 
you may be 




grinching yourself 

A lot of people 
talk about the stress 
of the holidays If 
you spend more 
time at the mall 
than with your fam- 
ily, or if you find 
yourself actually 
trying to match the 
wrapping paper 
with the garland 
color scheme, take a 
break. Slop and rcfocus. Take lime 
to smell the cinnamon potpourri. 

It is worth it to slow down 
enough to focus on the lilile things, 
the good stuff. Pour yourself a cup 
of spiced-up eggnog and waich the 
cat bat around the ornaments. Take 
a whifr of fresh pine A Christmas 
tree in itself is a source of pleasure 
When you look al the trimmings of 
the holidays, the beauty will make 




you feel wonderful if you let iL 

Keeping things simple during 
the holidays will pay off. and not 
just financially. Making cookies 
with your roommate or your kids is 
a fun way to spend an evening that 
can evoke happy childhood memo- 
ries. And they make great gifts, too. 
Besides, the mall will still be 
there when the holidays arc over 



Santa needs a new image? 



by Andrew Yoder 
Staff Writer 

In our currently "enlightened" 
times, Americans' beliefs and tradi- 
tions arc under attack from the 
"politically correct " Complaints 
have been voiced in the past about 
the spelling of "Christmas " 
Apparently continuing to include 
the letters "C-H-R-I-S-T" in the 
spelling would violate the religious 
preferences of those who choose 
not to believe in the existence of 
Christ. Thus, the alternative 
spelling "X-MAS" was derived to 
free the offended parties' minds, 

Why should we stop there? Isn't 
the whole concept of Santa Claus a 
bit outdated as well? What would 
the '90s version of Santa be like? 

First, the whole image of Santa 
needs to go. Instead of being an 
overweight, obsessive-compulsive 
giver wbo bosses around mentally 
inferior, "height-challenged per- 
sons." Santa should be a North Pole 
inhabitant of African heritage, who 
merely does the legwork for the 
ethnically-diverse female board of 
directors responsible for making all 
the decisions regarding delivery 



during the holidays. 

Additionally, children would no 
longer receive toys, which are too

Christmas is well on its way 
While lights, ihc smell of fir trees, 
and presents wrapped and tied with 
red bows all reflect the Christmas 
holidays Yet for some, the season 
will nw be so promising The holi- 
days can be a time of stress for the 
unfortunate. Make this a season to 
give, and jusl maybe someone less 
fortunate can have a more joyous 
Christmas. 

The Volunteer Connection, 
localcd at 227 E Washington 
Blvd., is looking for people who 
want to dedicate a portion of their 
time to help raise funds for children 
and families who arc less fortunate. 

This doesn'l mean standing in 
the freezing cold ringing a bell for 
quarters The Volunteer Connection 
realizes time poses restrictions for 
most people and have come up with 



volunteer opportunities that do not 
lake a lot of time. 

"The Celebrity Parade of 
Bears," located on 1021 S. Calhoun 
St. is looking for volunteers to 
watch bears and take admissions 
The Menial Health Association 
sponsors the parade lo help raise 
funds for families who face mental 
health problems A volunteer can 
sign up for as little as one hour. 

The Soup Kitchen and Rescue 
Mission is currently looking for 
volunteers to help serve Christmas 
dinner. Dinner is served to children 
and families who wouldn't have 
had a holiday meal to look forward 
to. Volunteers can devote a mini- 
mum of thirty minutes, and Mill 
contribute lo making someone's 
Christmas a little brighter. 

The Volunteer Connection 
encourages people to donate cloth- 
ing and toys to ihose in need. The 
Christmas Bureau always wel- 



comes clolbing. coats and toys lo 
give to families during ihe holi- 
days. The Salvaiion Army also 
needs coats and toys for children 
The Salvaiion Army helps sponsor 
the Angel Tree, which consists of 
wishes tied to the branches of the 
tree Volunteers can choose one 
and make a wish come true Some 
of the wishes can be as simple as a 
new pair of mittens. 

Whatever you choose to do, 
remember ihere are people who 
would appreciate your kindness 
Christmas can be a lonely time for 
those who do not have family or 
cannot provide the necessities taken 
for granted by most of us. Give a 
little and make Christmas what it 
should be: a lime to give. Anyone 
inieresied in volunteering should 
contact ihe Volunteer Connection 
at 420-4263. You could help a 
wish come true.

classroom buildings. Not only will 
this provide much more parking for 
students, said Rundell, mosl of the 
garages would be closer than the 
current lots and also work to keep 
pedestrian traffic out of the way of 
automobiles. 

In coordination with improving 
the river front scenery, a boardwalk 
is planned to conneel the north and 
soulh ends of campus. The walk 
will run parallel to ihe river, on the 
west side of the campus. It passes 
directly by ihe inlet of waler by the 
river, near where the gazebo is cur- 
rently located. The walk will noi 
only provide a relatively quick way 
to cross the campus, it will also 
allow studenls to see the river while 
walking. 



According lo Rundell. if dorms 
are added, ihey will most likely be 
placed on the triangle of land across 
Crescent Avenue. The area is not 
currently developed and is wooded. 
The triangle is large enough to 
accommodate dormitories, recre- 
ational areas, and possibly an obser- 
vatory. This location for the dormi- 
tories also opens up the possibility 
of tunneling under the road. 
Although ihe possibility of dorms 
will be able lo fit inlo the Campus 
Master Plan, they are not yet on the 
current plan. 

According to Katter. the plan 
will more than double the existing 
square footage for the campus in 
general and parking. Possibly one 
of the early additions will be a park- 
ing garage constructed by Walb 
Union. While Ihe whole plan is 



expccied to lake 25 years to com- 
plete sludents may benefit from

Heisman voters 
pay heed 




The rti.il!" r outside will be unfor- 
giving])- cold, but the criticism 
inside will be untorgivingly hot; 
hot for the voters, hoi for college 
football and hoi for the National 
Football League. For some reason, 
the news writers, whose votes 
determine the Heisman winner, end 
up tarnishing the award by com- 
plaining aboui die lack of produc- 
tion former winners have shown in 
the NFL, This trend of Heisman 
busts is nothing new. As a mailer of 
fact, very few achieve success in 
the NFL. In the las! ten years only 
Barry Sanders and Tim Drown have 
become superstars, This problem 
arose through no fault of the play- 
ers, but because of the voiers who 
are easily impressed by big num- 
bers from big schools (see Florida, 
and Florida State) If voters would 
follow three simple guidelines this 
prestigious award could again 
regain its luster. 

First, the Heisman winner 
should be a player who. if removed 
from his team, would lead lo its 
demise. Tommic Frazicr of 
Nebraska is not such a player. He 
was replaced by Brook Bennger for 
almost half the leam's games, and 
they never skipped a beat. Eddie 



George of Ohio Stale is not that 
player either I could run behind 
that offensive line for 100 yards a 
game Thai leaves us with Troy 
Davis of Iowa State and 
Northwesicm's Darnell Autry 

Second. Ihc Heisman winner 
must be the ultimate icam player. 
All four players meet the criteria 
here, especially George. He could 
have easily padded his statistics by 
playing late in blowout victories. 
but he chose instead to sit out the 
fourth quarter If George would 
have played every game, he could 
have toppled the magic 2000-yard 
plateau like Davis. The only differ- 
ence between ihc two is Davis had 
lo play every down of every game 
for his learn tn order to have even a 
remote chance of winning. George 
was surrounded by great players lo 
lake the pressure off of him, 

Third, the Heisman winner 
should be considered one of the 
greatest players ever lo have played 
college football, not the player with 
(he brighiest future in the NFL. 
There wdl be oiher option quarter- 
backs ai Nebraska and powering 
tailbacks ai Ohio Stale, but how 
many players will rush for 2000 
yards. Davis became only the fifth 
player in history to do so. but the 
previous four have all won the 
Heisman. It is not this faci alone, 
though, thai makes Davis as 
deserving as the others, for be 
accomplished what the others did 
behind a mediocre offensive line 
against top defenses. 

Voters, you don't necessarily 
have to follow my advice, jusl 
remember iL This is not a popular- 
ity contest. Keep thai in mind and 
the NFL may thank you for it some 
day 



Women's basketball team off to historic start 



by Jim Porter 
Sports Editor 

The women's basketball learn is 
off to the best start in school history 
with a 7-0 record. After capturing 
the Edinboro Classic Championship 
at Edinboro College, the 'Dons hit 
ihe road to win at Northwood and 
Tri-Sialc In their first two home 
games of the season, the Dons won 
the inaugural Summit City Shooi- 
Out by defeating the College of St. 
Francis, III., and Marian College. 
Going into conference play. Ihc 
Mastodons have the best overall 
record in (he league and look as 
powerful as any team ihey will face. 

"1 am really proud of this leam. 1 
am happy where we are at thus far 
They arc starling lo gel a feel of 
what the system is all about," said 
Head Coach Pam Bowden. 

Although Bowden expressed a 
relative pleasure with her team so 



far. she sees a couple of areas where 
Ihe team needs work "Right now 
we are dead even in the rebounding 
category. We really need to oul- 
rebound our opponents by 7 to 10 
rebounds a game," said Bowden 

While some migbt question the 
strength of ihe 'Dons' schedule, 
Bowden said no mailer who they 
play it all boils down to winning 

"Winning builds confidence and 
pride. The more you win, Ihc more 
you do not want to lose, " said 
Bowden, 'They are jusl now gelling 
a taste of that." 

While the beginning of the sea- 
son is about building confidence 
and pride. Bowden reiterated the 
fact thai ihe end of ihe season is 
really whai matters. 

"If we do not gel ranked. I will 
not be disappointed. What matters 
is that we are in the top two or Ihrec 
in the conference at Ihc end of the 
season." said Bowden. 



The Dons still have a lol of 
work to do in order lo continue re- 
writing the school's basketball his- 
lory books. Wiih ihe beginning of 
the conference season looming on 
the horizon, Bowden is anxious to 
play conference learns 

"I am really looking forward to 
the first three conference games of 
the season. After that I will have a 
better idea of where we are as a 
team. We slill have to work hard," 
said Bowden. 

If ihe women's leam can win all 
of its home conference games and a 
couple of road games, finishing 
among Ihe lop two or three learns in 
the conference is a realistic goal. 

"This is our home and we have 
to have the attitude thai no one is 
going to come in here and beat us," 



said Bowden "If we win all of our 
home games and sneak a couple of 
road wins here and there 1 think we 
will be in good shape " 

Despite early success. local 
media has failed to give the 'Dons 
much attention Home games are 
also not well attended Whether ii is 
the stigma of women's collegiate 
athletics or not, it is a problem 
Bowden sees as just another hurdle 
her team will have to overcome on 
the road lo success. She urges Ihc 
public lo come oui and watch, to 
give the players a chance to prove 
themselves 

"It is lime for people to give 
these kids what they deserve," said 
Bowden.

Sports I ilihir 

For sophomore 
forward Leah 
Sheets, basketball 
is something that 
came naturally at 
an early age. Her 
brother and sister 
both played bas- 
ketball. It was fol- 
lowing in those 
footsteps that led 
her to the game. 

"Ever since I 
was little I have 
loved the game." 
said Sheets. 

In her first sea- 
son at IPFW. 
Sheets appeared 
in all 27 of the 
team's games. 
She finished the 
season as one of 
the top freshmen 
in the conference 
and averaged 113 
points per game. 
This season Sheets 

has taken her game a step further Uianks to a vote of 
confidence from Uie coaching staff. 

"They gave me more confidence. They are allowing 
me to handle the ball more and play ai the guanl posi- 
tion. Last year I played more forward, but this year I 
am getting more opportunities on the court," said 
Sheets. 

Sheets views her role on the team as not only being cation major. 
a team player but also as helping to keep everyone "II is just

Her speed and 
ballhandling skills paid 
off for team honors, as 
well as personal 
achievement last week-

points against the 
College of St Francis 
and 14 against Marian 
College, Sheets was 
named the Most
