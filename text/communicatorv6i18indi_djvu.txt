Parking problems 

As Indiana-Purdue at Fort Wayne moves closer to autonomy, (tic Spirit of 
cooperation between students, faculty and administration has Ik.-iti gratifying fur 
the most part. Task Forces on governance, administrative and academic 
structure, aiong with various other inlra-umversity efforts, have featured faculty 
and staff sitting down with students to discuss and decide important issues 
concerning the future of IPFW In most discussions, there has been give-and-take 
on both sides, with the final decision usually a satisfying one, or at least somewhere 
near a Kissinger-like "balanced unease." 

That cooperative spirit was lost at the latest meeting of the Joint Parking 
Advisory Committee, where parking fees for 1974-75 were set. New rates for next 
year were set at $A0 per year for an "A" sticker, reserved for faculty and slafl only, 
and a rate of S6 per year for a "B" sticker, open to students, and any faculty and 
staff who did not want an "A" sticker. The "A". sticker would guarantee a reserved 
spot for what some perceive to be "the elite" of the university, in this case faculty 
and staff. 

There are two student members nl .t[';\C. both i.l whom attempted In introduce 
a compromise on the matter They suggested that any person buying an "A" 
slicker be given a space in one of two parking lots on campus, the south lol near 
Kettler Hall, or the northwest lust between the Library and Neff Hall. All other lots 
would be designated "B," and open on a first-come, first-serve basis to all. 

Many students at IPFW hold down full or part-time jobs, along with attending 
classes, and in many cases it is more difficult for that student to find a place to 
; park. The reserved-space concept has been tried before at IPFW, and simply does 
not do the job. Reserved areas were often half filled, while m. my students (nidged 
through blocks of mud to attend i'l;r;ses Win lei lie mud has nearly disappeared. I he 
elitist philosophy of a few facility members apparently has not. 

The Communicator suggests thai .II'AC ret -(insider its position, and either 
discard (he reserved faculty stall parking space concept entirely , or else limit it to 
no more than one or two lots, with the "A" option open also to students. If any 
Student, faculty or staff member (eels he or she should have a re.servetl spot, they 
should have an equal opportunity to pay for it. 

Since one of the considerations of JPAC was to generate enough revenue to 
make the parking fund self-sustaining, it might be necessary to increase the 
amount paid for a reserved "A" space to perhaps $."&gt;o per semester. All other 
spaces could be designated "B," and t mild be either free, or carry only a nominal 
charge. We are only concerned thai the burden be shared equitably. 



New appointments 

The ftrsl administrative appointment &lt;'l Chancellor Imnaltl Schwartz have 
been announced, and they appear to he good ones If ay Wilkes was named assistant 
to the chancellor, Dave Brennnn is now director til continuing education, and .Mm 
Thatcher is to be the campus business manager.
