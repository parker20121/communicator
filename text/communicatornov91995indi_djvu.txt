"We're excited about the oppor-

ic,"said Ledbetler. 

Of Uie 400 known AIDS cases In

said in Allen County alone there are 
an estimated 2,400 people who are 
unaware ihey have the disease,

Shaquille CNeil's soda of 
choice will soon no longer be made 
available on campus. According to 
Vice Chancellor of Financial 
Affairs Walt Branson, the universi- 
ty signed a contraci with Coca Cola 
for the exclusive sale of the approx- 
imately 170,000 soft drinks and 
fruit drinks sold on campus each 
year. 

The contract with Coke will lake 
effeci as soon as the university's 
vending supplier Canteen 
Corporation receives the vending 
machines. According to David 
Leeka, director of university pur- 
chasing, the switch was made to 
offer students a decrease in cost. 

"We are decreasing the price and 
lowering the university's commis- 
sion." said Leeka. "ll will decrease 
the university profit," 

Don Hager, district manager for 
Canteen Corporalion, said il will 
cost him more money to supply 
Coke exclusively, but he is adjust- 
ing to the university's direction. 

Freshman Michelle Ramsey said 
she and many students will appreci- 
ate die saved money. 'The cost is 
ridiculous. A machine anywhere 
else cost less, why should it be 
more here?" said Ramsey. 

According to Hagcr his company 
and (he university will lose profit 
due to the change. He said Coca 
Cola producis are more expensive 
for him to buy. "I'm paying com- 
mission to the university for each 
sale. The change will mean less 
profit for the Canteen and the uni- 
versity, " said Hager. 

Branson said Coke products 
comparable lo Pepsi producis will 
be offered, but some students are 
not sure the nickel savings is worih 
the loss of favorites such as 
Mountain Dew, "There are too 
many days where I depend on 
Mountain Dew to gel to class," said 
freshman Emiley Rogers, "There 



isn't enough caffeine in Mello 
Yello." 

Freshman Mike Koher said he 
feels college studenis are more 
atOracled to Mountain Dew's image, 
taste, and caffeine conteni. "I'm not 
a Coke drinker. I prefer Mountain 
Dew, and I think most college stu- 
dents do as well," said Koher. 

Hager also believes the loss of 
Mountain Dew could hurl sales. 
"The big difference is we sell an 
awful lot of Mountain Dew on cam- 



pus," said Hager. 

According to Hager, approxi- 
mately 1,080 cans of Dew are sold 
on campus each week. 

"There is zero comparison of 
Mountain Dew to Mello Yello," 
said Rogers. "They won't get my 
S,60, I will be bringing my own 
pop." 

Leeka said the contract with 
Coca Cola will end on June 30, 
1996, and the university will 
reevaluate the situation at that lime.

With Rabin went peace 



The dcalh of Yitzhak Rabin 
nurlu the dcalh of peace in Israel 
Alihougb early in lus iiTe he led his 
soldiers inio haiile in 1976. Rabin 
had come lo siarul Tor peace in ihc 
Middle EasL 

Peace was noi always on ihc 
agend.1 Tor Rabin. As a (cenagcr he 
received his calling to fighi 
Palestinian miliiants II wasn't until 
1992 ihai ihe prime mmisier began 
10 implcmeni an if-you-can'i-beat- 
'em-makc-peate ailiiode wiih die 
Arabs In 1494. Rabin shared ihc 
Nobel Peace Prize wiih Yasser 
Arafai and Shimon Peres, Rabin's 
successor, for Iheir erforti lowards 
peace 

The loss of Rabm has been com- 
pared 10 the condiiiun in which Ihe 
US found iLself immediaiely fol- 
lowing Kennedy's assassination. 
This is a fair analogy. Bui perhaps 
President Clinlon was on lo some- 
thing when he rmiked the as.sassi- 
naiion of Rabin with the killing of 
Manin Luiher King Jr. Rabin grew 
lo become Israel's great hope in 
constructing peace. He was trusted, 
by bis conslituents and other politi- 



cians, loved and re^pecled He was 
also the fir^t prime minister to be 
bom in Israel, and the Hrsi to leave 
office by way of a killer The loss 
may be felt as heavily as 
Kennedy's, but his dedication lo 
peace resembled King's work to a 
greater exient 

Rabin was able lo sell the peace 
package lo the Israeli people on 
Iwo levels. First, he convinced 
ihem dial his peace proposal was 
attractive simply for the sake of 
peace On another level, he was 
able lo ensure thai his peace plan 
offered die most viable policy for 
national security. 

One question we have is. "How 
would the Israelis have acted if 
Rabin's muderer were a 
Palestinian''"' An enormous back- 
lash would have sparked continued 
violence, which the region and the 
people would not have recovered 
from for generations. 

We are saddened by Rabin's 
death. His hard work was unjustly 
rewarded with death Yitzhak 
Rabin, peacemaker, was a man all 
could look up to with admiration.

Sometimes a mascot 
is just a mascot 




The 
World Series 
just ended 
two weeks 
ago with the 

stomping the 
Indians into 
ihc- dirt, 
During that 
lime many 
Native- 
Amcriean 
groups 
protested as 
they do every 

year the 

Braves attend 
the World Senes. The Series gives 
them national coverage to demon- 
straic the problem of racism toward 
the people who originally lived in 
this land. 

In every major spon in America, 
there is at least one mascot with a 
name taken from pre-Plymouih 
Rock heritage. The worst is he 
Washington Redskins What if Oiey 
called themselves die Washington 
Darkies or the Heebs? Would

Americans stand by so complacent- 
ly? I doubt diey would. 

But here is a quesiion — why are 
there no protests about die names of 
INDIANa or INDIANapolis' 
Aren't these names 
jusi as derogatory as 
the Cleveland 
Indians or ihe 
Atlanta Braves? 
Maybe I have no 
business in writing 
this since I have 
only a little Native- 
American blood 
flowing dirough my 
veins. My long- lost 
ancestor, who mar- 
ried into the 
Cheyenne tribe. 
never carried 
any of 



wife's tradi- 
tions. Her cul- 

ture's impact in 
my family has not been fell in 
seven generations 1 know nothing 
about my Native-American her- 
itage, and I probably never will 
The only diing I know of my ances- 




tor and her people come from PBS 
and movies like "Little Big Man." 

Bui that IS irrelevant. What I 
want is a new name for Indiana 
Something which does noi offend 
any soul out there in 
America. I've thought 
of some examples but 
maybe you (our lovable 
audience) could help 
me. 

• The Stale of Status 
Quo 

• The Commonwealth 
of Hoosierland 

• The State of West 
Ohio 

• The Protectorate of 
North Kentucky 
Or since these seem 

;ry serious why not name 
our stale after something we 
are famous for: 

• Soy Bean Province 

• The Domain of Heavily-Tatoocd. 
Chain Smoking Rednecks 

• Porcinia (We would be 
Porckanians) 

Maybe Indiana isn't really too 
bad after all. 



Letter to the Editor 



Media ignores important stories 



To the edilor. 

It is pathelic dial die people of 
this great country can no longer rely 
on the mainstream press to explore 
the reii! news Many Americans arc 
concerned about our soldiers serv- 
ing under foreign commanders on 
United Nations missions. Michael 
Neu is an American serviceman 
who has refused to wear Ihe uni- 
form of die United Nations. Why 
has the mainstream media seen Tit 
10 ignore this important story? 

Mr Neu was recently given a 
blue helmet and ordered to attach a

How to survive gay 
holiday hell 




Paul Tupper 
#=cr&gt;»orfJ 



The holi- 
days are fast 
.ipproaching to 
the dismay of 
many in acade- 
inia. Christmas 
seems to mean 
very little 
when you arc a 
college siudeni. 
Everything you 
ask for is in 
regard lo what 
you need to gel 
most notably .. 



You can inadvertently be your gay 
self without talking lo your family 

about it. Plus you 



it 



t'W" 



ahead in school 

CASH — and everydiing you 

give must Ht in your already 



e more 
likely to be yourself when 
you are around your friends. The 
whole point of coming out is lo free 
yourself lo be you. A guest will 
make diis ea-sier Your family may 
find it more difficult to criiicize 
your lifestyle 




more. In the nineties Christmas din- 
ner with die family may very well 
become a week of dodging painful 
conversation and uncomfortable 
lies lo upgrade your paiheiic 
life 

Being gay often 
makes you the 
black sheep of ihe 
lamily. You're noi 
really allowed lo 
talk about who 



you i 



e dating c 




what neat dimgs you're doing 
in the gay community, so the day 
winds up being a lull. There are 
ways you can make your holiday 
family loriures belter 

First, lake someone to talk to... 
preferably someone you are dadng 



when you have 

an unfamihar face in the room. 

Second, try not to lie to diat one 
family member everyone is trying 
to protect by not cluing them to 
your gayness. This is usually 
a grandmother 'who 
wouldn't understand." 
Yeah, rigbi! 

This line of reasoning 
doesn't hold because we 
all know gay people arc 
not a nineties invenuon. If you are 
the first homosexual your family 
has seen, then they have more prob- 
lems than jusi your being gay. If 
grandma can't handle ii, then diat's 
her problem, not youri. By hiding, 
you are proiecdng no one. 



Third, don't let anyone try 10 
"straighten you out" while al dicse 
gatherings. You know 
diis is happening when 
t'tt/I ^ cousin iries to tell 
li|i^ yu '^^ ^ close friend, 
who happens lo be of the 
opposite sex, or if you keep 
hearing menlionings of the children 
you'll never bare. If you have a 
pesky aunt who says to you. "So 
Michael, you're gay. arc you seeing 
a psychiatrist?" you just snap back, 
"No, I'm seeing a corporal in the 
Army." Gets them every lime. 

Fourth, if someone mentions a 
past or present relauonship, be sure 
to speak of your own past or pre- 
senl relationships. It is 
important for 
families to 
see that we 
date, love and 
lose just like 
he straights, 
and ihai our 
relationships mailer. If they say 
diey don't wani to hear about your 
dance cdrd, dicn insist that die sub- 
ject IS off limits lo everyone In 
family/gay communication what's 
good for them should be good for 
you 

All of these work well when vis- 
lung Holiday Hell But what works 
best for me is planning a big gay 
pany immediately after your family 
gatherings By the time your family 
his chewed you up you and your 
friends will be ready for a grand 
ball So plan ahead

Child care workers: unappreciated, underpaid, overworked 



by Skip Ittrry 
Guest Cnlumnl^l 

I u.scd 10 work al a child care 
ccnicr — for sin years, in fact 
During my tenure there I did nearly 
evcrydiing dial needed doing: drove 
ihc van, delivered the lunches, 
laughl difrcrcni age groups' classes, 
and Tinally served as the education 
director ll was a great place lo 
k'.'im about human nature. 

I was fa.scinaled by children, and 
serious ahoui working well with 
ihcm. I talked with other teachers, 
with parents, with the kids them- 
selves, I read, look classes, experi- 
mented will) educational concepts, 
and formed opinions. I was quick to 
think I had answers for difficult 
questions — questions Tm now noi 
certain even have aaswcrs. I learned 
more than I ever taught. 

And I gained a rich store of 
memories. 

1 remember the afiemoon a four- 
year-old slood atop the monkey 
bars (excellenl balance), unzipped 
his paiils (above average dexterity), 
and watered the playground in a 
wide arc around him (good eye 
coordination). 

1 remember the three -year-old 
with Ihe vivid smite, eyes ihe shade 
of corndowers, and a temper that 
could perforate bricks. She was 
funny and quirky and endearing. 
And [he nipport she shared widi her 
mother was delighUul to see. Late 
one evening that child learned what 
u meant to be human. 

Her mother had just picked her 
up from the sitter's. Someone 
missed a stoplight, and her mother 
was killed. The little girl was 
thrown from ihc car, injured but not 
loo seriously Life was inexorably 
altered in an instant Though her 
smile relumed, as did her temper, 
that chdO's spiril wasn't ever quite 
as bright again. 

1 remember the five-year-old 
who's [sic] emotional problems 
towered over those of any oiher 
child. He carried so much anger and 
pain and frustration inside him (hat 
he was uncontrollable when 
enraged. And the smallest incidcnis 
could evoke his rage. 

Yet once 1 watched him paiienily 
explain to a three- year-old bou in 
put together a difficult pu/i^lL- lie 
sal with her for twenty or ihiriy 
minutes, taking the puzzle apan .uiJ 
methodically reassembling it. all the 
lime showtnp her \vh3i he u,i. 



doing Never once did he get exas- 
perated. 

He. belter than anyone, under- 
stood what it was not to understand 
a puzzle, his father had abandoned 
the family. His mother was con- 
fused, frozen by her circumstance, 
unable to help her son. His whole 
life was one huge, frusUBIing puzzle 
which periodically grew so intolera- 
ble he had to pilch the pieces inio 
[he air and scream at the absence of 
logic. 

1 remember these three kids and 
scores of others. Bui my purpose In 
writing is not to regale you widi the 
trials and glories of an ex-child care 
worker. This is not intended lo be a 
misly-lens view of my past. Simply 
put. I don't miss working in the 
child care profession. 

I don't miss it because it's loo 
Important lo be left to people 
who've crossed the line ihat sepa- 
rates purpose from habit. By the 
time I quit. I had 

Child care needs people who are 
working in it because ihey have a 
purpose greater that making the 
rent, people who've willingly cho- 
sen to do what they're doing, peo- 
ple who are reahsiic enough to deal 
with the problems they encounter 
and idealistic enough lo pursue 
solutions to those problems. Those 
people come to work caring about 
their jobs. 

Child care doesn't need people 
who come to work out of habit 
Unfortunately it's much easier to 
come out of habit than out of pur- 
pose Why? The lack profession.il 
standards. 

Long after workers in other 
fields would have been fired for 
lackluster performance, child care 
workers are permiiied to stay on 
It's difficult to find reliable people: 
any who shows up regularly is bet- 
ter ihan no one. 

There's an attitude prevalent out- 
side the field that permeates the 
self-concept of those inside That's 
the atliiude that child care is not 
truly a profession, but simply insu- 
lutionalized baby-sitting Hence,

child care workers .ire not u^iy pro- 
fessionals, but simply glorified 
baby-siiicrs. 

It's difficult to maintain a sense 
of purpose and to achieve a sense of 
pride in the face of no respect. It's 
also difficult to attract and retain 
high quality workers — child care 
centers generally have a high 
turnover rate, 

Il's easy lo lose any sense of 
purpose when the general percep- 
tion of your job is as low as your 
pay. It's easy for your job lo 
become simply a job, something 
you do out of habil. Child care 
workers often see Ihemselves as 
para-professionals at best, or baby- 
sitters at worst. Doing something 
else for a hving becomes inviting 

These people deserve beilcr. So 
do the kids who spend their days in 
child care centers What's it say 
about our society thai we look down 
on the very people we entrust thou- 
sands of children to daily? Those 
kids deserve lo stay in places 
staffed by people who are there by 
choice, who care about the quality 
of care they're providing, who have 
a professional pnde in themselves 
and those who surround them 

lis up to Ihe rest of us outside of 
child care to provide ihose workers 
with that pride, Parents need to take 
a few minutes to talk wiih, and lis- 
ten to. the people who've spent the 
day with their children. Journalists 
need lo focus attention on high 



quality child care programs, rather 
than solely on Ihose few centers 
involved in child abuse cases. 
Businesses need to help centers 
raise the money they need to pay 
for the facililics and staff to insure 
quality care 

Such actions would serve as 
indications lo child care administra- 
tors and workers that we recognize 
the important role they play in our 
society. 

The allemaiivc is a continuation 
of the present system. Admittedly 
there have been improvements over 
the past decade, but more are need- 
ed And it seems lo me that the 
most essential improvement needs 
to be in altitude — ours as a soci- 
ety, and workers' as professionals. 
There is, to some extent, a cause 
and effect relationship here. 

Which comes first, the respcci 
for the profession or the profession- 
al respcci? I think the latter. Child 
care workers have to stand up for 
themselves, not just in the matter of 
money (though they certainly have 
every right to demand better pay). 
but also in the matter of profession- 
al pride. They need to take care of 
Iheir own, policing the actions and 
the altitudes of one another. Pride 
results from efforts and accomplish- 
ments. 

Hand in hand with professional 
respect goes money, Having once 
been in the profession, I know how 
imponani both these matters are lo 



child c.ift workers, especially lo 
those who are committed to Iheir 
jobs. Il's a hard fad — and hardly a 
fair one — that our society lends to 
reward the least lo those who serve. 
ITie pay issue is likely to be around 
for a long limc to come, I'm afraid. 

Which is one of the reasons I 
won't again be involved in child 
care. But while money is a factor, 
more important is Ihe realization 
that I wouldn't be capable of work- 
ing as hard as I once did. 1 wanted 
to be Ihc best at what I was doing. 
Maybe I was as good as I thought I 
w.is - maybe I wasn't, Dul I had a 
sense of pride in what I was doing. 
And I had a purpose. 

But somewhere along the line I 
lost touch with that purpose. Maybe 
It was that I wanted someUiing more 
— better pay and more respect, for 
instance. When I caught myself bid- 
ing my lime, going to work out of 
habit. I knew it was time for a 
change. 

Now, five years down the line, I 
still admire the people who are in 
Ihe child care trenches, the fire of 
purpose in Iheir eyes. They're cer- 
Liinly worthy of Ihe lille of profes- 
sional They're doing what they're 
doing as well as they can in spile of 
the fact they're bucking great odds 
lo do so. There's a lot they won't 
gel from their jobs. 



Ihey won I get nch. 

They won't get much recogni- 
tion. 

They won't gei many pals on the 
back. 

But what they will gel are the 
rewards ihcy couldn't gel doing 
anything else. They get hugs and 
smiles and pasie-splolehcd collages 
from roomfuls of children. 

That's what 1 remember best 
about my years in child care, diosc 
rewards. And that's what 1 miss 
because I can't find any replace- 
ments. The money may be lousy 
and the demands may be weari- 
some, but Ihe rew.irds arc second to 
none.

Personality quirks enrich 
your love life 




b&gt; Janet T(.l&gt;ey 
Fealuru Kditnr 

When I was much younger (and 
noi nearly so wise). I had a 
boyfriend, who professed to 

love 



loved some nuliy. yet 
endearing habit, 

I realized that he 
had only seen a 
whitewashed version 
of myself, devoid of 
my true weird per- 
sonality traits and pet 
theories. It was not 
exactly his fault, 
since I had kepi them 
concealed until Ihcy 
had almost disap- 
pL.ired My quirk garden 
was fallow- 

I needed lo rediscover myself, 
and I was newly determined to cul- 
tivate what was truly mine — my 
idiosyncrasies I would not hide 
Why do you love me?" I asked ^f^"* any longer. If someone thinks 
it's strange that I still carry my 
blanket with me. fine. It's okay if 
they know that I talk to my car and 
I think it makes her run belter. 1 
have gotten m touch with my inner 
animal, who has her own quirks. 

The freedom of cultivating your 
own uniqueness is thrilling, and 
continually unravels a new yam of 
fun, I rccogni« that I am pan gypsy 
and have a compulsion to travel to 
unknown destinations. 1 denounce 
Ihe competitiveness of football fans 
as silly, but will sulk if you beat me 
at chess. I ihink if 1 painted a pic- 
ture, it would look tike one of Van 
Gogh's, I secretly like Susan 
Powier's hair. I develop acute 
Toureltc's syndrome when the tem- 



one d.iy. eager to know why 1 was 
so special to him. 

lie said I was "beautiful and 
sweet." This answer gave me satis- 
faction for about two seconds. Then 
I thought, dial's it? 

Given the fact that there always 
IS someone prettier, and it is impos- 
sible to be sweet (whatever that 
means) all the lime. I became a little 
insecun: about the relationship. 

I was. in a word, replaceable. So 
1 .saved both of us the trouble and 
moved on. 

His answer was a let-down, 
because I had hoped for something 
a little more spcctTic. I would have 
preferred his saying that he was 
crazy about die way I swig beer, or 



peraiure drops below forty degrees. 
1 think black tights look good 
with shorts 

In "Arthur." when Dudley 
Moore fell in love with Liza 
Minnclli, it wasn't because she was 
beautiful and sweet. He liked her 
method of obtaining neckwear 

Humphrey Dogart. in 
"Casablanca." asked Ingrid 
Bergman. "Who are you realty, and 
what were you before? What did 
you think about, and what did you 
doT" I think she would have been a 
more interesting character if she 
had answered. "Well, in my rebirdi 
therapy class. I found out I was an 
anteater in a previous life, which 
explains my love for chocolate cov- 
ered ants even today. Want one?" 

My advice, especially to a young 
woman, is to expand your eccenlnc- 
ilies. grow your garden of peculiari- 
ties Have Ihmgs you absolutely 
must wear, eat or drink to have 
peace of mind Develop theories 
about people, and then use them to 
explain whatever happens to you 
that day Then let your uniqueness 
show. 

Tell the guy on the firM date Uiat 
you think the garlic hanging around 
your neck really works to keep 
vampires away, or that you collect 
beer cans. 

If he doesn't run away, he will 
be stuck on you forever.

You can't judge a movie by its 
title. This can be painfully true 
when you rent a movie you have 
never heard anything about. 

Thus rcuting the movie "flabe" 
and cxpeciing to see scaniily-clad 
women on a beach somewhere was 
a drastic mistake. Maybe the rating 
(G) should have given a clue as to 
the moral content of this movie; but 
with a name like "Babe" the chance 



had to be taken. 

"Babe" is a coming-of-agc story 
about a pig who has an exuaordi- 
nary view of life on the farm. He 
lives on a farm with his two own- 
ers, who look as if diey are a nine- 
teenth century version of an extra- 
normal husband and wife. Mom 
feeds the chickens, prepares the 
meals and goes to her circle meet- 
ings, and Pop sees to the regular 



mechanical operation of the farm. It 
seems that Pop's chief occupation 
is training sheep dogs to watch over 
and protect the sheep, which are the 
main source of income for ihe cou- 
ple.

Fraternities at IPFW

"Fat, drunk and stupid is 
to go through life..." 

— Animal House 

Hidden away in a corner ol 
Walb Memorial Union's scconi 
floor lie the offices Greek socia 
organizations Arc these room 
really home to the kind of pcopli 
the media portray ihem to be — sex 
crazed collcgiaies, looking for their 
next parly and next beer? Many ol 
Ihe members of Greek social orga- 
nizations feel that they arc receiv- 
ing an undcsen'cd bad reputation. 

Due to public exposure through 
movies, such as Animal House and 
the Saturday Night Live skil "The 
Delia Delia Delia Girls." a siigma 
has been attached lo members of 
fraiemilies and sororities. Sorority 
members are portrayed as shallow, 
unintelligent, and powerless 
women, who arc consianily on Uie 




look-out for a man. Senior Shannon 
Loppshire, a member of Pi Beta Phi 
sorority, described the stereotype of 
a typical sororiiy member as "prob- 
ably someone who isn't very inicr- 
esicd in education; someone who is 
jusi looking for social advan- 
lagcs, ,who is shallow and only 
iniciesteU in appearances. " 

When fraiemilies make naiional 
headlines, ihe stories often concern 
a ftatemiiy pledge who was b&gt;c.itcn 
as pari of a hazing incident. 
National fraicrniiy and sorority 
membership numbers can reach to 
ihc hundreds of thousands and there 
arc bound to be a "few bad apples," 
according lo Kevin Orthman, mem- 
ber of Sigma Phi I:psilon Fraicmily. 

"According lo die media, we're 
just a bunch of alcoholics, and we 
like to beat people up." said Phi 
Kappa Thela member 
Chris Johnson. 

"Hazing incidents occur in the 
minority of fraicrniiics, not Ihe 
majority. " said Onhman. 

According lo members. Greek 
social organizations arc more than 
jusi a mere excuse lo party 
Orihman said that the organizations 
provide academic advice and pre- 
pare their members for ilic future. 

"Our goal IS to create a well-bal- 
anced man." said Orihman. 

To pariicipaie in any of Ihc 
social organizations, members musi 
maintain an established GPA and 
keep lo a certain code of eihics. 
All of the chapters participate in 
community service projects such .\s 
hagging groceries al Scon's Food 



Stores, Inc. for Ihc American 
Cancer Soeicly. 

Odier members s.iid that ihcy did 
not experience the Greek slcrco- 
lypc. Sarah Prcslon. Dcbbi Sills. 
Andrea Daily and Kim While, 
members of Delta Gamma, all 
agreed that because of IPl-W's 
small size, die siercoiypc of a typi- 
cal sororiiy did nol apply, 

Loppshire described her Greek 
experience as very nurturing. 

"We don'i place emphasis on 
personal appearances or siatus and 
we discourage underage drinking 
and .myihing Ihai could damage our 
futures," said Loppshire 

Fraternities at IPFW may escape 
being judged by ihc stereotype of 
typical fraternities on larger cam- 
puses, but perhaps partly due to 
lack of any opinion at all. 

"1 don'l even know of any soror- 
ities or fraternities here." said 
sophomore Dan Lennington, a 
political science major,

The checkered 
history of hackey-sac. 
a condensed version 



by Alsha LaRiKhe 
Staff Writer 

With seemingly never-ending 
exams and leciurcs, ii can be lou^h 
10 escape all the stress and simply 
relax However, some sludenis have 
found a way lo enjoy Ihcir lime 
between classes 

You may have seen a curious 
circle formed outside of Kcillci 
Hall These five or so people pass a 
small, soft ball with their feel. In 
case you are wondering. Ibis is 
"hackey-sac." 

The game of hackey-sac origi- 
naicd from soccer. Soccer was 
inuoduced to Harvard students in 
the I820's by Scottish, Irish and 
English immigranis Harvard stu- 
dents used soccer as a way lo ha/e 
fa'shman. The game was onginally 
very rough and violent Soccer 
didn't become a professional spon 
until 1966. During that lime. 
Harvard students played around 
with the soccer idea and came up 
with a similar game called 
hackey-sac. 

Unlike soccer, hackey-sac is 
played with a soft ball that is no 
bigger than an orange. Students 
gather around in a circle and pass 
the ball back and forth by using 
skillful footwork Coordination is 
the key to the game. 

Brian Spencer, freshman, began 
playing the game his junior year in 
high school, but said he had diffi- 
culty at fusi getung the hang of it 
"It just lakes some practice." he 
said 

Some remain in the spectator 
category, for now, 

"I just like talking to my friends 
and watching the guys play. I join 
them sometimes but I never have 
gotten the foot thing down yet." 



- Bab* continued from page 4 

daughter brings her family for a 
visit and inquires about the where- 
abouts of the fax machine they 
bought Mom and Dad tor 
Christmas In response. Mom 
explains that the machine was far 
too complicated for their simple 
lives; however, we see laler in the 
movie Pop has in%enied a machine 
to open die from gate whenever the 
■iheep dog wants to be let ouL 

The ironic inconsistency isn't 
limited to this one occurrence 
cither lliroughoul the movie simi- 
lar contradictions provoke stimulat- 
ing di.scussions about the variety of 
Jnigs abused by the screenwriters 
while the script was being written. 

In spile of these flaws. "Babe" 
mikes a great commentary about

popularly held conceptions when 
Babe The Pig surprises the other 
barnyard animaU with his amazing 
intelligence and diplomatic ability 
in dealing with other animals. 
Action in "Babe " occurs when the 
normal sheep dog. Shep. becomes 
too old and hearing impaired to 
work as a sheep dog at the annual 
coumy fair, which had been a great 
hohby of Pops. Pop surprises 
everyone at the fair, along with his 
status-conscious wife, when he 
decides to use Babe The Pig as a 
sheep dog. or sheep pig, lo be more 
accurate 

Babe has a singular way of deal- 
ing with the flighty sheep, in which 
he requests that they obey the mas- 
ter's commands, rather than the 
autocratic method of coercion 
employed by the old sheep dog 
The sheep arc, of course, exta-mely 



attracted to this kind of control and 
gladly do whatever the satirically 
polite little pig requcsLs. 

I will omit further details for 
those who still plan on renting 
"Babe" Let me just say that this 
wacky movie concludes with a too- 
cute ending that could be predicted 
by anyone who watched Disney 
videos as a child. Renting this 
movie causes one to long for the 
Kind of out-of- this- world euphoria 
that the authors must have been 
experiencing when they wrote 
"Babe "

said Amy Green, a theater major 

The students outside Keitler Hall 
sometimes receive inquisitive looks 
from other students who have never 
seen the game played before Brian 
Spencer doesn't seem to mind. 

"It doesn't really bother me 
because they probably just wonder 



what the heck we are doing." said 
Spencer, Anyone is welcome lo join

it ain't so Mo-dell 



by the AtJanU Braves in the World 
Series. The city of Cleveland has 
not had a champion in town since 
God knows when Now. just as 
everyone in Cleveland begins to 
recover from Ihe mourning for their 
beloved Indians, Art Modell has 
stabbed Cleveland in the heart. He 
even twisted the knife a couple of 
limes. 

In case you are not a football 
fan, heaven forbid, or your cable 
has been out for the past week, here 
is the story. Mtxlell, die Cleveland 
Browns aging owner, has sold 
Cleveland fans out. In the immortal 
steps, or should I say semi-trailer 
tracks, of Indianapolis Colt's owner 
Bobby Irsay, Modell is packing up 
his team, taking his pigskin and 
moving to. of all places, Baltimore. 
Maryland How ironic it is that a 
city which lost its own team 10 




Indianapolis in the middle of the 
nighi IS now embracing the mid- 
nighi high jinx of Modell? 

Modell says the move is a result 
of the lack of inieresi presented by 
ihc city of Cleveland. He dies the 
fact ihal the Indians received a new 
home, enabling them 10 move 
from the ancient, cavernous 
Cleveland Siadium. The 
Cavaliers, Cleveland's 
NBA team, now plays 
in a brand new. 
luxurious 
arena, and 
the city is 
home to the 
S95 million 
Rock and 
Roll Hall 
of Fame. 
Modell does 
have a legitimate gripe 
in the fact that his team has had to 
make due within ihc pre-hisioric 
confmes of Cleveland Siadium. 

So, he packs up his stuff and 
moves to Baliimore. As a result, 
Modell will receive an estimated 
S50 million in incentive monies 
from Ihe city. Eveniually, the 
Browns will also get 10 play in a 
luxurious, state-of-ihe-art facilily, 
Modell is happy, although fearing 
for his life. On Sunday, as the 
Browns losi lo the Houston Oilers, 
Modell was a no-show in his 
owner's box high above the stadi- 
um. Cleveland fans are livid. 

It is sad, almosi tragic, lo sec Ihe 



end of yei another icon in the world 
of sports The Browns and their 
frigid home on Lake Erie ar« foot- 
ball The green grass, the open air 
stadium, the now famous "Dog- 
Pound" is what football is supposed 
to be all about. Sadly, 
football has 



money is 
the number 
loyalty. 
Forgel about 
the fans. It is lime 
that we. as sports fanatics, 
wake up and realize there is no real 
allegiance to much of anything in 
the world of sports any more. An 
Modeil and his greedy, cry-baby 
attitude have proven thai fact true 
once again. I mourn for Cleveland, 
While 1 am not a Browns' fan by 
any stretch of the imagination, you 
have 10 feci a bit of remorse for the 
fans who have stuck it oui year 



after year The Bmwns usually sell 
out the 80.000 seat siadium they 
call home No more. A silent hush 
will now settle across the lush 
meadow that once hosted the likes 
of Jim Brown. Gxa'pl for the lonely 
whistle of the wind as it whips 
through the siadium, there will be 
no more hoois and hollers at old 
Cleveland Siadium. Get used 10 
calling the team, clad in brown and 
orange, the Baltimore Browns. 
Somehow it just does not have the 
same ring? 

Take it as you will, .just remem- 
ber the view from under the bleach- 
er isn't always a pretly sight.
