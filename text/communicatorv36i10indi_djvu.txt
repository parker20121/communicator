University of Notre Dame

presentation. 

The professor has written 
two books dealing with the 



topic of familial influence in 
child development. Cummings 
has also published over 150 
scientific articles on the 
subject, 

Cummings anticipates the 
talk will be beneficial to a wide 
audience. 

"Anyone who has ever been 

romantic or marital relationship 
would take away some valuable 
information about how they 
may affect their children," 
he said. "Those students or 
individuals reflecting on their 
parents' conflictual relationship 
may gain some insight into 



anticipated for the presentation. 
Cummings will first talk about 
prior research studying the 
effects of marital conflict on 
children. 

The focus will then shift to 
new innovations in the field, 
stressing the role of additional 
factors in marital unrest. These 
include the role of parental 
depression, the father's part 
in the conflict, alcohol use 
and its effects on a marriage, 
and marital struggle in cross- 



cultural e 

The final issue Cummings 
will discuss relates to the 
use of research conclusions 
in establishing programs 
for prevention and parental 
education about the elTccts of 
marital conflict on children. 
While the talk will center on 
marital issues, Cummings sees

Light to 
visit IPFW 
in January 



Harvard Professor Richard 
Light will be visiting the IPFW 
campus in January to discuss 
his book Making the Most 
of College: Students Speak 



Room 224 while the second 
discussion will be held Nov. 9 
from noon to 1:15 p.m. in the 
Classroom Medical Building, 



the discussions will introduce 
students to the subjects dealt 
with in the book. "We hope

the Most of College shows 
students learn more when 
studying in small groups 
outside of the classroom 
setting and, moreover, that 
good advising is crucial for 
scholarly success. 

Additional activities and 
jobs add to a student's overall 
satisfaction and also aid in 
their learning. IPFW assistant 
professor of theatre history 
and a director of the Nov. 3 
discussion session Shari Troy 
states that Light's book asks 
two vital questions: What 
choices can students make to 
get the most from college, and 
what are effective ways for 
faculty members and campus 
leaders to translate good 
intentions into practice? 

The book has been 
influential nationwide and 
even helped establish some 
programs at IPFW. According 
to Troy, "The First Year 
Experience and Learning 
Communities program at 
IPFW is partly a result of the 
conclusions from Richard 
Light's research and findings." 
Registration for the book 
discussions is accessible via 
the CASA website. 

The first 50 registrants will 
receive a free copy of Light's 
book. Making the Most

Professor 
speaks out 
against Bush 

By Fiza Najeeb 



(U-WIRE) POMONA, Calif. 
- Dr. Dennis Loo. a behavioral 
science professor at Cal Poly, 
discussed his essay "No paper 
trail left behind: The theft of 
the 2004 presidential election" 
at the Campus Forum on 



W. Bush "was never elected, 
and needs to be unelected." 
Loo delved into a compilation 



did not actually win the 2004 

presidential election. 

In Loo's essay, he wrote, 

registered voters... land] won 
re-election despite approval 
ratings below 50 percent." 

Loo also brought up the fact 
that'CNN reported at9p.m. EST 
on election evening that Kerry 
was leading by three points in 
the national exit polls based on 
well over 13.000 respondents, 
land only] several hours later 
at 1:36 a.m. CNN reported that 
the exit polls, now based on 
a few hundred more - 13531 
respondents - were showing 
Bush leading by two points.a 
swing of five percentage points 
from a tiny increase," which 
he believes is "mathematically 
impossible." He mentioned 
"irregularities" that occurred 
in the 2004 elections, such 
as "banning black voters in 



Latino felons, (and| providing 
extraordinarily few voting 
machines in predominately 
Democratic precincts in Ohio". 

In an election, exit polls 
are used to catch frauds, 
however, Loo wrote there has 
been "significant." inexplicable 
discrepancies between exit 
polls and official tallies only 
[starting to showl up in the U.S. 
in 2000.. .the discrepancy was 
not the exit poll's fault... but in 
the official tallies themselves." 

In November 2004, the 
Ukrainian government was 
exposed for "presidential 
election fraud" with exit polls as 
evidence, but "the U.S. media 
dismissed anyone who pointed 
out this same evidence of likely 
fraud in the U.S. elections as 
'conspiracy theory crazies," 
said Loo. 

After the election of Bush 
in 2004, surveys showed 
American's voted for him 
based on "mora! values." Dr. 
Loo questioned this due to 
President Bush's past history 
of being "caught in a lie about 






. rucked by prison abuse 
and torture scandals at Abu 
Garib, failing to catch Osama 
Bin Laden, badly embarrassed 
during the debates, and |being|

Institute for Parapsychology, 
an independent organization 
located just off the edge of West

Formerly known as the 
Parapsychology Laboratory 
at Duke University, the

precognition, psychokinesis

daughter and current director

several well-known discoveries. 

One of the most noted 
accomplishments occurred 
when former Duke professor of 
psychology Karl Zener designed 
a famous ESP experiment. 
Zener cards-featuring various 
symbols, such as stars and 
wavy lines-are still used in ESP 
testing today. 

In 1962, J.B. Rhine retired 
from Duke, but he chose to 
continue his research by moving 
his laboratory off campus, 
where individuals like Daniel 
and Rhine Feather continue to 
study the paranormal today. 

Although Daniel's encounter 
may seem unusual, psi 
experiences -- a general 
term used to describe 



"It's as much like

being in the dream

Rhine l.-iiihcrsaid. 

In a 2001 Gallup poll, 65

that they had personally 
experienced extra sensory

ESP is currently being 
studied at the Rhine Center.

Coming to grips with what is

Here is the plan: beginning 
the week of Homecoming, Nov.

be allowed to pick up vouchers 
for the game against the Irish. 
These vouchers will most

Homecoming Court. To receive 
your voucher, students will only 
have to present their IPFW ID

one has time to go get tickets, 
that one person can take all his

box office and get tickets. For 



older students who might want 
to bring their family, when you 
pick up your tickets you can 
request a section out of the 
student section. 

Once students receive their 
vouchers, they need to turn 
them in for tickets as soon as 
they can. because on Dec. 3

Rant #2— Midnight Madness 

I only attended Midnight Madness for about 
20 minutes this year, and I probably stayed 19 
minutes too long. I, unlike maybe must people 
at IPFW, could care less about MTV and "The

maybe I am pan of the majority.

For the Mastodons' three seniors, it 
is the last time they will step foot on the 
Gates Sports Center floor in front of the 
ever-growing and raucaos crowd that 
has increasingly frequented the home 
games thanks, in part, to the trio's play 
over their careers as Mastodons. 

For Fabiana Souza, Ashlee Roth and 
Erika Leitzke, this is it. After Saturday,

"I'm really sad," said Souza, the

but I know its going to come up some 
time. It just goes so fast. It seems like 
yesterday was my freshman year and I 
was just starting and it's just over." 

Roth feels the same way as her senior 
counterpart. 

"Well, it makes me sad, obviously 
because it is going to be one of my last 
games," Roth said. "I think it's a happy 
experience as well because to look back 
at four years of playing at IPFW it was an 
incredible experience for me."

In 2001, IPFW was in its first year as a 
D-l athletic program, and the volleyball 
team finished with just 13 wins. It 
was 18-5 as of Nov. 1 this season and 
attendance has reached around 900 at 
some home games. The reason, Souza 
said, is because fans enjoy cheering 
for winning teams. Roth agreed and 
was surprised when she discovered 
classmates and acquaintances who she 
really didn't know that have showed up 

"It was so cool to talk to people in 
my classes that I didn't know who saw 
me play," Roth said. "People from my

If the Mastodons can continue their

Military Movie Top Ten Salutes Our Soldiers 



By Anthony Maurer 



War movies are the stuff of magic 
when they are ilt me properly. I hey give 
people who have never experienced 
comhat the perspective into the lives 
of the soldiers who lived the battles. 
The good ones make the audience 
feel as if they were in the wars and 
battles themselves. The great ones put 
the viewers inside the heads of the 
soldiers, feeling their pain, and every 
breath as they step. I have compiled 



portrayal of the controversial World 
War II genera], who was respected, 
feared and appreciated all at the 
same time. The film was produced 
in 1970. and directed by Franklin |. 
Sib, diner. Fellow general anil comrade 
of Patton's, General Omar N. Bradley, 
aided in the writing by co-authoring 
the book the movie was based off of. A 
must see for WWII buffs.

in front of their own lines with no

World War I equivalent to the battle of 
Baston in WWII. Whittlesey's men are

America's single greatest loss of young

1.) Full Metal Jacket (1987) 

I can still heat the Mickey Mouse song. This 
movie follows ihe experience of one Marine 
through basic to the cities of Vietnam. Matthew 
Mudine was the perfect dehumanized jarhead 
in a war-torn era. The story not only gave the 
perspective ul being "in the slut," bin tiotn basic 
training, and through the eves of the enemy. With 
more memorable quotes than a cliche book, and 
a story about the least favorite American conflict

Possibly a high member of my top ten

be a big hit. and a great war movie.

such as: The Baseball Furies, The Boppers, 
Ihe Rogues, [he Ihgli-liats, Ihe lilies, The 
Tumbull A.C.'s, and The Gramercv Riffs, jus[ 
to name a few. But only one gang is perhaps 
the most toughest: i he Warriors based (mm

(Michael Hecki. they head up towards Pel ham 
Bay Park in the Bronx for a special meeting/ 
truce by Cyrus, the "Lord Byron of the City". 
It is then that a gang member shoots and kills 
( yrus and falsely accuse The Warriors for it. 
Now the boys from Coney are on the run. 
Between them and safety stands over 20,000 
NYPD cops and the enemies. With only one 
chance at escape and only one night to do 
it, The Warriors will do anything possible, il 
necessary, to get back home. I city is out for 
The Warriors. 

1 work at Blockbuster and nne night I pi iked 
up The Warriors purely on a whim. It didn't 
look TOO entirely appealing, hut the story 
seemed pretty hip. Guys travel up the city, 
boos gets killed now that have to get out alive 
Simple, but somewhat catchy. 

When I got home. I relaxed into my movie

and Cap'n'Crunch and began to watch. 
From beginning to end, I was floored by the 
undertones of this movie.

Brothels shines 



Film Review 



2005 Oscar for best I &gt;u&lt; omcntary ai the 77th 
Annual Academy Awards. 2005 Golden Kirmaree 
Award for Best Documentary at the Bangkok 
International Film festival. 2iil)l Best Film at 
the Cleveland International film Festival. 

All these, pins over 12 other nominations 
and wins for the inspirational 2001 documen- 
tary In /an. i briski and Hoss k.inilm.in. rm kcicd 
"Born Into Brothels" initi stardom-landing the 
children in the film, and their incredible pho- 
tography, in the spotlight. 

Zana Briski, a photographer trom London. 
had. over the course ol several years, assimilated 
herself with the families living in the Red Light 
District of Calcutta when she ^m ihe idea to film 
a documentary about the children of the prosti- 
tutes existing in these dire conditions. 

As the children were parti, ularly interested 
in her cameras, Briski decided n&gt; give each of 
Ihe eight their own camera and instruct them ■ 
in the ways of photography; thus becoming the 
basis for her documentary. Ihe audience meets 
the eight featured children and learns what life 
is like for them. They vary in age from 10 to 14. 
Some of them are allowed to go to school; others 
are forced to sta&gt; home, caring for their younger 
siblings white their mothers sell themselves and 
their fathers get high. We also get to see theirart 
progress. 

Some of their photos are better than 
those of professionals, they have more depth 
and emotion, more vulnerability and purity, 
more knowledge and wisdom. lach child has lL 
distinct personality .aid astonishing intelligence 
that shines through their work. 

Avijil, who was but 1 1 at the time of film- 
ing, is among one of the most talented. He was 



The pianist would whirl through stunning 
arpeggios only to have the orchestra create a 
completely different mood h\ the next section. 
Mis performance was greeied with immediate 
applause. As an encore, Sieuerman simply 
introduced the piece as "Bach." This piece 
was delicately done a capella as the orchestra 
watched. 

The concert also included Gazebo 
Dances by Corigliauo and S\mphony No. 1 in 
F minor by Shostakovich. The Gazebo Dances 
were lively, full of dissonances that melted 
into harmony and kept the percussion section 
jumping through the mood swings.

10-year-old. Kochi. dreamt of going to a board- 
ing school so as to receive a decent education; 
something Hnski nil's in accotnplish--which is 
no easy feai in that very few schools in Calcutta 
will accept the child of a 
prostitute, la. h of these children tugs at the 
bean strings. Briski expertly brings to light their 
everyday struggles while exquisitely depii ling 
their hopes and dreams. It also portrays their 
cleat cut view of the world. Several limes, each 
ol them mentions their inability to escape from 
that which surrounds them. 

Everyone of the girls speak of. one day, 
being included in "the line" (the prostitutes that 
line the streets outside their residence), or of 
being sold to help make money lor their fami- 
lies. At the time, 1 1-year-old Miami talked about 
it with little emotion.

younger brothei and sister. Her nonchalance

Meiers 
withdrawal 
favors GOP 

By Joshua Huck 



ignominious end of President 
Bush's nomination of Harriet 
Meiers to the Supreme Court, 
everyone is wondering, "Who 
will he pick next?" 

surfacing about Harriet Meiers 



Oct. 3, I withheld judgment. 
For all the Democrats who'd 
hud their fingers crossed, she 
didn't seem like the worst-case 
scenario many of them were 
expecting for Bush's nominative 
encore. The combination of 
her lack of a "paper trail" and 
a steady stream of reports of 

events In her personal history 
only served to reinforce her 
utabllity. 



this administration it's basically 
a foregone conclusion. 

All things said, she was 
relatively underquoted, 
inconsistent and maddeningly 
mediocre. To put it another way. 
Bush chose plain ol' vanilla, 



more harmful for the positio 
He could have picked : 

i(k'(il(]giL;il lightning rod r 



influential Federalist Paper 10, 
he warned of the influence of 
radical factions: 

"A zeal for different opinions 
concerning religion, concerning 
government, and many other 
points ... have, in turn, divided 
mankind into parties, Inflamed 
them with mutual animosity, 
and rendered them much more 
disposed to vex and oppress 
each other than to cp-operate 



&gt; shows or type furiously 
weblogs, cranking out partisan 



24 






Modern-day radical factions 
have more opportunities than 
ever to present themselves 
to an audience of millions, 
influencing policymakers by 
proxy and warping our leaders' 
perceptions of the country. 

In this particular case, 
Harriet Meiers got the boot 
because she didn't conform to 
the standards of the right's own 
vocal minorities, whether or 
not their agendas mirrored the 
country's as a whole. 

In the most recent CNN/ 
USA Today/Gallup poll only 
38 percent of Americans 
considered themselves "pro- 
life." Hard right congressmen 
such as Sam Brownback, R- 
Kansas, and many from the 
Christian right, however, 
seemed to be asking for nothing 
short of a promise direct from 
Meiers' lips that she would stop 
at nothing to overturn Roe v. 
Wade. 

Hard-line conservatives such 
as Chailes Krauthammer and 
William Kristol dragged Miens 
over the coals for not being a 

fact that - by raising enough 
hell in the media - these people 
achieved their first goal, Meiers' 
withdrawal, is disturbing. 

The possibility that these 
unrepresentative minorities 
could succeed in influencing 
Bush to choose a justice that 
fits (heir specific criteria is 
downright un-American. 

In a semi-perfect world. 
Bush would choose a candidate 
who had demonstrated true 
equanimity, righteous opacity, 
and preferably, had sterling 
credentials to brace themselves 
with. For a parched country 
denied but a few drops of 
precious moderation every 
so often, a middle-of-the- 
road pick would prevent more 
partisan wound-opening. 

More realistically, Bush has 
already exposed himself as 
caving into the will of the party. 
' harrowing 
_ _joll numbers 
and mounting scandals, Bush 
needs the support of his base 
in order to salvage his legacy. 1 
doubt there will be any public 
relations stunts or knowing 
winks necessary next time 
around. 

Nothing says "I'm sorry" like 
an agreeable Supreme Court
