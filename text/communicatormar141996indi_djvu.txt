Houseman has competition 



by Cassit Ritter 
Chief Reporter 

Dayid Roach announced bis can- 
didacy for Congress last month 
Roach will run against Gerald 
Houseman, professor of political 
science, for the Democratic nomi- 
nation in the 4th congressional dis- 
trict. 

In recent years, Roach has cam- 
paigned for several offices as a 
Republican but has yei to win a pri- 
mary. 

Steve Shine. Allen County GOP 
chairman, said he is pleased Roach 
has decided to run on the 
Democratic ticket. 

"Just the mention of his name 



connotes to mc what is wrong with 
the political system," Shine said 
"In my opinion, be stands for noth- 
ing but being the bad boy of poli- 
tics." According to Shine, local 
Republicans are relieved Roach has 
"thrust himself onto the 
Democrats," 

"He is known for sending 
obnoxious, irreverent, prejudicial 
and absolutely absurd faxes with 
cryptic unintelligible messages," 
Shine said. 

According to Roach, professors 
do not have real jobs and should be 
required to go out into the "real 
world" and create good jobs with 
good pay 

Roach said he believes the goals 



of President Clinton will stop 
America's "fall from grace " If 
elected, Roach pledges to help the 
president to eliminate "Big 
Government" and help raise the liv- 
ing standards of citizens and work- 
ing poor 

Referring to Souder. Roach 
wrote. "I'm glad we have 'blue- 
dog' Democrats in Washington to 
moderate the extremists, such as 
Congressman Souder. and his 
White, German, Separatist neigh- 
bors in West Hamilton." 

If elected, Roach pledges to 
"expose political corruption, and 
criminality wherever it may rear its 
ugly head "

The estimated final cost of the 
technology upgrade project is 
approximately $492,000 IPFW 
students pay three dollars per credit 
hour toward the technology fee. 
Currently, the technology fee is 
being used to start e-mail accounts. 
upgrade existing computer labs and 
also to add a computer lab to the 
library 

The e-mail project cost over 
S89.000 and is now available to all 
students. E-mail start-up kits were 
sent out over spring break, howev- 
er, students must activate their 
accounts in order to use e-mail. 

According to Ron Signa. direc- 
tor of the computing and data pro- 
cessing department, students may 
find it difficult to find a work sta- 
tion when accessing their e-mai) 
accounts. However. Signa said the 
problem should be only temporary 
as more work stations are being 
added. 

Students will not be able to dial- 
in to their c-mad accounts this year 
because of a lack of VAX lines. 

"Dial-in capability is a problem 
here on campus because we only 
have thirty lines that dial into the 
campus." Signa said. "The main 
problem is that if we gave students 
dial-in access to these same lines, 
we would probably keep those thir- 
ty lines busy all the Ume. therefore 
anyone trying to call campus, for 
any reason, would get a busy sig- 
nal." 

However, it is possible that next 
year more VAX lines will be added 
to IPFW. so as not to tie up the 
business lines. The new VAX lines 
would be used exclusively by stu- 
dents for dial-in capability The 
addition of more VAX lines is esti- 
mated to cost 530,000. 

Part of the e-mail project also 
includes training students on how 
to use e-mail. Three thirty-minute 
videos will be available for class- 
room viewing or for check-out at 
Hclmke Library. These videos will 
help students become familiar with 
the PINE e-mail software, which is 
the mail system dial will be used 

College Cable Access Channel 6 
will also broadcast the videos

who are still very computer-pho- 
bic," Signa said. "The videos will 
teach them how to get onto a com- 
puter, how to use the keyboaid and 
how to use PINE e-mail." 

The videos will also include 
bow to use the different capabilities 
of PINE e-mail, such as how to 
send, receive and save messages. 
According to Signa. PINE e-mail 
will also be more user-friendly than 
the VAX accounts. 

In addition to the e-mail project, 
the technology upgrade includes 
complete and partial renovation of 
the computer labs in Kettler and 
Neff. When finished, the lab reno- 
vation project will cost approxi- 
mately S262.991. 

Kettler labs 204A and 204B 
were completely renovated last 
summer. These labs now have 
Pentium P5 computers, laser print- 
ers and new furniture. Kettler 217 
andG13 will be upgraded with new 
laser printers this summer and 
should be completed by the begin- 
ning of classes next fall. Kettler 
217D will be upgraded with new 
laser printers as well as new furni- 
ture, There arc also future plans to 
upgrade Neff B71 with laser print- 
ers. 

Workstations for people with 
disabilities were added to all of the 
computer labs. 

In addition to these renovations, 
black and while scanners in the 
computer labs will be replaced by 
new, color-capable ones. 
According to C&amp;DP, there will be 
one scanner in each building. 

"We arc trying to be cost effec- 
tive, yet still provide the resources 
that students need," Signa said. 

According to Signa, construc- 
tion of a computer lab wdl start in 
May of this year, the estimated cost 
for which is $109,344. The lab will 
be installed on the main floor of the 
library and will replace the termi- 
nals along the east wall of the first 
floor. The installation of five P5- 
100's with CD ROM and eighteen 
P5-100's without CD ROM should 
be finished by next fall. 

"Anyone should be able to walk 
into any computer lab and do what 
they have to do with out walking 
all over campus to find what they 
need," Signa said.

THE SHAGGY 
CONSPIRACY 




Curt 
Bohrem 



Recently I have come inio con- 
taci with a subculture I find 
deplorable. These people have cul- 
tivated an idea in order to Tit their 
own maniacal means, and their way 
of thinking sickens me. They go by 
a variety of names and titles, but 
the most fitting is "People who 
believe Shaggy from Scooby Doo 
was stoned all the time." 

I find that claim not only out- 
landish, but disheartening. 
Everyone who is anyone has seen 
at least one episode of "Scooby 
Doo." Personally, it was on the 
same plate as "Godzilla." 
"'Spiderman" and "Superfricnds" in 
iny childhood diet. It was while dis- 
cussing the finer points of the 
"golden age" of TV cartoons that 
this heinous accusation was first 
brought to my attention. 

I want lo make sure that every- 
one understands what I'm saying. 
In the spirit of persuasive journal- 
ism, I will present both sides of the 
coin, firs! with the popular argu- 
ments for the Shaggy=stoner idea 
and then my counterargument 
known simply as Shaggy =slacker 

•Shaggy always had the 
muncbies. (Common among hemp 
users.) 

•Shaggy was skinny and scruffy 
j looking. 

•Shaggy fits the stereotype of 
the time. Fred was the military 
geek. Velma the brainy feminist 
and Daphne the giggly, dizzy, go- 
go girl- 
Presented above arc the three 
most common points At this time, 
I'll present my reasons as to why 
those arguments are not 100 per- 
cent solid 

•Shaggy was always hungry 
True, but 1 myself could fit 
Shaggy's description because I'm 
always ready to eat. For that matter, 
name any teenager who isn't 
always hungry 

•Shaggy was skinny and scruffy 
looking because he was lazy. It's 
just that simple 

•Casey Kasem, the "Reach for 
the stars but always keep your feet 
on the ground" top 40 DJ provided 
Shaggy's voice. Hipster as he is, I 
doubt even Casey would falter at 
being the "voice of the marijuana 
user on a children's cartoon."

On "The Incredible 
Hulk." they would 
not allow the name 
Bruce Banner for 
the main character 
They believed it 
sounded loo homo- 
sexual and went 
instead for the name David Banner. 
So why would they allow a chil- 
dren's cartoon character, with sig- 
nificant air time, to be a drug user? 
Maybe the Mystery Machine 
was loaded up with more than just 
super computers and sleeping bags. 
It's possible that the animators used 
Shaggy to show how clever they 
were at deceiving the networks. 

Nevertheless, it all comes down 
to the fact that Shaggy was a hero. 
Sure, be ran from the ghost pirate 
and the plerodaciyl man, but who 
wouldn't? Shaggy and Scooby 
always ended up getting the job 
done no matter what. I only wish 
people could focus on his inspira- 
tional bravery instead of his sup- 
posed addiction, 

And don't even start again 
because EVERYBODY could hear 
Scooby talk. 



The Ha Ha Comedy 
Club provides laughs 



by Amanda ManJon 
Features Editor 



Yw tmt 



many Dons were 
ized and confused in 
'arm southern 
Florida sunshine, Darius Rucker of 
Mootie and the Blowfish fame 
graced a small stage in Fort 
Wayne's night life. "Hold my 
hand..." Oh, the sheer magic of it 
all. 

OK Reality check. So Hoolie 
was not in Fort Fun over spring 
break. However, when Chicago 
comedian "Mr Spark Man" threw a 
baseball cap on. strummed his 
ukulele and lip-synched, it was hard 
to tell. (Really hard lo tell. "Oh God 
save me! If 1 bear this song one 
more lime, I'm going lo cut my 
right ear off." cried one audience 
member.) 

Spark Man came to Fort Wayne 
courtesy of the Ha Ha Comedy 
Club. The small club, housed in die 
Ramada Inn, showcases stand-up 
comedy. It provides a refreshing 
break from the dinner/movie rou- 
tine 

As I sat at my small table, placed 
snugly in the front comer of the ele- 
vated floor. Indianapolis comedian 
Jim Burrows started off the 
evening. 

Each weekend. Ha Ha usually 



features two live acls. an opener 
and headliner Although, the open- 
ers tend lo have less experience 
than headlining acts, 
don't assume that 
this means the 
comedy is not as 
good. 

in front of a 
"New Orleans" 
mural. Jim joked aboul 
becoming lost ii 
Miejers. Word of 
advice to 
Angolians: if 
Jim is performing, 
stay away from 
the front 
tables. 
The 

comedian 
playfully 
harassed some audi- 
ence members from Angola aboul 
their vehicle of choice — a tratlor, 

After Jim finished, emcee for the 
night Pat McCormick and Indiana 
Institute of Technology faculty 
member took the stage. 

"Did you hear the one about. ..." 




started Pat 1 thought, "Pal don't. 

Please don't do it. Oh you did." Pal 

reeled off one of those "little boy 

sees mommy 

and daddy in 

Ihe act" jokes. 

Pat 

threw a few 

more bombs at 

the audience 

before Spark 

Man came on. I 

watched as the sole 

waitress deftly served 

drinks in the dim, 

crowded room. 

During Spark 

Man's act, audience 

members laughed at 

everything from 

child care to 

divorce and lhal 

crazy impression of 

ker. The waitress fed Spark 



Man some unexpected material 
when she received an unfortunate 
bum from one customer's cigarette. 

In comparison with Snickers, the 
Ha Ha Comedy Club is smaller and 
more intimate. Admission, food and 
klrinks are '•lightly less expensive, 
although the menu selection is not 
as broad. 

The Ha Ha Comedy Club (1212 
Magnavox Way) offers shows on 
Friday at &amp; p.m. and Saturday at 8 
p.m. and 10:30 p.m. Admission is 
So and you must be al least 21 
yean, of age to enter 

If you feel like watching a cou- 
ple of comedians sweat for two 
hours under hoi stage lights or bum 
waitresses with your cigarette, the 
Ha Ha Comedy Club definitely is 
the place to go Just bring a bottle 
of Pepio Bismol You'll need it to 
survive Pat's filler.

Beyond the *F* word 

Feminist speaks ±o students 




Paula Kamen will be on cam- 
pus Monday, March 19. to 
present ber lecture titled 
"Beyond Ibe 'F' word: the next 
generation's vision for a massed- 
based and accessible women's 
movement" The lecture will take 
place in Ncff Hall. Room 101, at 
7:30 pm The event is sponsored 
by a variety of IPFW departments 
as pan of the March celebrations of 
Women's History Month 

Kamen, a journalist and author 
of "Feminist Fatale: Voices from 
the "Twenty something' Generation 
Explore the Future of the 'Women's 
Movement.'" has spent the last five 
years louring (be country and 
speaking to students and faculty at 
more than 30 universities. 

"The goal of my speech," 
Kamen told The Communicator in a 
telephone interview from ber home 
in Chicago, "is for people to see 
that feminism has been used to 
divide us, and I hope to show how it 
can unite us 

"I want to challenge people to 
ask new questions, not to brainwash 
or convert anyone to my views. I 
want to teach the value of feminism 
as a tool for thinking critically," 
Kamen said. 

Before writing the widely 
acclaimed 1991 book, Kamen trav- 
eled across the country. 



ing more than 200 men and women 
between the ages of 18 and 30, in 
order to "create a dialogue among 
young people about women's 
issues," she said According to 
Kamen. 10 percent of Ibe people 
with wbom she spoke were male 
and another 10 percent were older 
feminist activists 

Perhaps relying on her training 
as a journalist, Kamen detected a 
certain conflict among young 
women today. 

"Most young women believe in 
everything feminism stands for and 
benefit from the women's move- 
ment," she said, "but do not want to 
be called the F word 1 tried to 
uncover the roots of this stereo- 
type." 

In her book. Kamen identifies a 
number of potential causes for the 
negative way in which many in the 
younger generation view feminism, 
including inaccurate, sensationalist 
journalism, homophobia and the 
mistaken stereotype that all femi- 
nists are man-haters. 

"Feminism is very diverse." 
Kamen said, "and activists always 
stress that there are many issues 
within the women's movement." 
Kamen said she discovered during 
her interviews that young people 
identify a number of major issues 
facing women today 

"The major issue young women 
are concerned about is reproductive 
rights, not just abortion but real 
issues having to do with housing, 
health care and birth control," the 



feminist said. 

"Also, sexual violence is a cen- 
tral issue politicizing young people 
Tbis includes sexual harassment, 
sexual assault in the street and 
acquaintance rape. 

"And work and family issues arc 
important. Women of this genera- 
tion expect to be in the labor force 
their entire lives, unlike earlier gen- 
erations of women This makes the 
women's movement seem more rel- 
evant to their lives. It's really a sur- 
vival issue; if you have to worry 
about child care and sexual harass- 
ment, it makes it bard to bring 
home a paycheck," she said 

According to Kamen, every 50 
to 75 years women in history have 
had to rekindle the women's move- 
ment. In an effort to maintain the 
momentum gained in recent 
decades, however, she encourages 
women of this generation to accept 
the torch she says is being offered 
to them. 

"An important goal of this book 
is to point out issues to this genera- 
tion and to gel the talk started about 



how we can address these issues." 
tbe author said. 

Looking toward the future of 
feminism. Kamen sees a movement 
in which "issues of diversity and 
identity are important, not just sex- 
ism but racism and classism." She 
said the goal for this generation is 
to have a mass-based movement 
because creating change requires a 
lot of people. 

In addition, sbe advises tbe 
women's movement to address 
problems in society which affect 
women but are not necessarily 
viewed as feminist issues, such as 
single moms on welfare, the dispro- 
portionate number of older women 
in poverty and environmental dan- 
gers. 

"We have to emphasize a flexi- 
ble definition of a feminist 
Feminism means doing things of 
your own choice: you can have a 
family and a husband or not. It's 
about choices, not dictating one 
way of being," she said. 

Kamen earned her bachelor of 
science in journalism in 1989 from 



the University of Illinois, where she 
wrote for the "Daily Illini." the uni- 
versity's student newspaper 
Writing about women's issues on 
campus, such as acquaintance rape, 
a rally against sexism and a fratemi- 
ty's raiding of a sorority, she quick- 
ly earned herself the nickname 
"Feminist Fatale " She said she 
was hurt and surprised by tbe label, 
as sbe had always considered her- 
self "radically moderate " 
Nevertheless, she was intrigued by 
the stigma attached to feminism and 
credits this experience with inspir- 
ing ber to explore the causes of that 



stigma. 

Reflecting for a moment about 
the presidential primary campaign 
now in progress. Kamen said sbe 
believes feminists became passive 
after the election of Bill Clinton. 

"Tbe Republicans have so much 
power in Congress, and there is so 
much rhetoric directed against poor 
and single moms. It shows how 
women have to stand up for the 
issues they believe in." she said. 

Kamen is currently writing ber 
next book which will be published 
sometime next year. Its focus will 
be young women's sexual attitudes.

Taiwan could hurt U.S.-China relations 



With China breathing down the 
neck of Taiwan, Ihc U.S. has to 
make a difficult decision: If China 
invades Taiwan, should the U.S. 
offer military support 10 the island? 

Taiwan - still considered by the 
Chinese to be their territory - wants 
to hold free presidential elections, 
but China wants to keep the upper 



band in an effort to control Taiwan. 
Many fears have surfaced during 
this round of China's warnings to 
Taiwan, including nuclear weapons 
and expansive military capabilities 
Furthermore, the leaders of China 
have proven that they consider their 
citizens to be expendable (see 
Tiananmen Square or forced abor- 



tions), and a big population of over 
one billion citizens may provide the 
Chinese army with many legs And 
with U.S. soldiers lied up in Bosnia, 
we may not be able to compete. 

There is also a fear of impairing 
relations with China, with whom it 
has been quite difficult to make 
friends. Years of negotiations have 



brought somewhat comfortable 
communications between China 
and the United Slates American 
opposition now would not sit well 
with the Chinese government 

Whatever Clinton does, you can 
bet the November election will 
have a major effect on his decision.

Any child could explain the 
necessity of checks and balances in 
our political system. You know. 
the president has the power to veto 
a congressional bill, the Congress 
can override that veto, and the 
Supreme Court decides whether or 
not it is constitutional Because of 
this system, "'We the People" are 
protected from one branch of gov- 
ernment becoming tyrannical and 
imposing its will on ihe other two, 
or worse yet on us; it is not overly 
dramatic to say thai this is the foun- 
dation of our republic, the basis of 
our freedom However, it is a con- 
cept with which Sen. Bob Dole of 
Kansas has had considerable diffi- 
culty Lei me explain. 

In 1 964 the Supreme Coun 
beard a case called Reynolds v. 
Sims, in which was challenged the 



Bui Mr 

Dole— then a mere representa- 
tive— didn't like it It seems he 
was more interested in maintaining 
states' rights than human rights 
So. he and oihers tn Congress set 
out on a crusade to leach the jus- 
tices a lesson Just before 
Christmas break, at the very end of 
the 88lh Congress in 1964, they 
passed the Government Employees 
Salary Reform Act (sounds scary, 
doesn't it?). 

Basically, the Aci was a person- 
al message to Ihe nine guys work- 
ing just up the street. It said that 
each member of Congress would 
receive a pay raise of S7.50O that 
year, as would all federal judges 
throughout the country, but. as you 
can imagine, each justice would 
only receive an extra S4.500. In 
effect, Mr. Dole and his cohorts in 



practice of legubuve redisricting Co „ , m ^ jm . 

at .&lt; lit,' ,it, i,1 ,-rn,,r,n., iK-ii -,11 a!|i ° ' 



as a means of ensuring that all citi- 
zens of a stale would enjoy equal 
representation in their respective 
state legislatures. After reviewing 
the facts of ihe case, consulting ihe 
Constitution and otherwise doing 
whai ihey were hired to do. a 
majority of the justices determined 
that indeed redisricting was per- 
missible under ihe Constitution. 
Their ruling, known as ihe "one- 
man-one-voie" decision, was prop- 
er and. wiih ihe benefit of hind- 



lices saying that iheir decision in 
Reynolds v. Sims had jusi cost 
them S3.000 each. 

It was pure blackmail, and 
everyone knew it A big stink 
erupted in Washington Political 
junkies and commentators won- 
dered what would happen nexL In 
typical lawyer language the 
American Bar Association Journal 
called it "an affront to ihe principle 
of ihe independence of ihe judicia- 
ry." Everybody was steaming mad. 



Bui noi Mr Dole. He was loo busy 
plotting and planning. 

There had been an election in 
1964, so when the 89th Congress 
came to order, there were fresh 
faces determined 10 right the 
wrongs of their predecessors in the 
previous Congress. The new mem- 
bers quickly submitted a bill to 
increase ihe justices' salaries. Of 
course, an awful debate ensued, 
and once again Mr Dole showed 
bis lack concern for our beloved 
system. 

He stood in front of the 
Congress and said: "I take this lime 
because whenever thinking of the 
Supreme Court, I ihink of last June 
15, 1964, and reapportionment 
decisions handed down in the 
Reynolds against Sims and the 
related cases It has been suggested 
lhat perhaps section 2 of the bill 
might be amended whereby the 
effective dale of the pay increase if 
adopted by this House, would be 
the date the Supreme Court revers- 
es the decision in Reynolds againsi 
Sims." 

One of Mr Dole's friends, Rep. 
Paul Jones of Missouri, weni so far 
as to propose an actual reduction in 
salary for the justices. Of course, 
that would be a violation of the 
Constitution, bul Mr Jones was 
just sure he was on the right track. 
In the end. Mr Dole's side won 
and the justices were stuck with the 
lower pay raise. 

Now Mr Dole wants us to send 
him to the White House, Others 
say we should send him to elemen- 
tary school for a refresher course in 
social studies. My only question is 
ibis: After 3-1/2 decades in 
Washington DC. should he go lo 
school there or should we bus him 
back and forth to his own "district" 
in Kansas?

'Put up or shut up 






Those who know me well know 
that I like to talk politics, especial- 
ly at the national and international 
level. In fact, once engaged in a 
conversation on politics. I usually 
have to be lold to shut up. I simply 
don't want to quit once I've start- 
ed To those who have questioned 
my intense interest my justification 
is simple: I am interested in politics 
because it affects my life in some 
very significant ways. Let me 
explain ... 

Firsi, politics establishes laws 
which restrict my behavior. I am 
told how fast I may drive, how I 
may exercise my constitutional 
right to bear arms, and when I may 
practice my God-given right to free 
speech. Violations can lead to my 
being fined or imprisoned. Of 
course, I realize that for a stable 
society to exisi, individuals must 
relinquish certain rights, but it is 
only through participation in the 
political process lhat I can insure 
my rights are not ovcr-resiricied. 



Phillip 
Marx 



Second, my gov- 
ernment taxes me, 
and it uses these 
taxes to pay its 
expenditures. Of 
course 1 realize lhat 
if I am lo have 
government, 1 must 
help pay for it. And 
I realize that some 
of these expendi- 
tures provide 
greater benefit to 
me than their cost. But, it is only 
through the political process that I 
can ensure thai I am noi overtaxed 
and lhat my government does not 
overspend. 

The final reason that I am inter- 
ested in politics is of a more 
somber note My government, on 
my behalf, maintains a standing 
army whose job mcludes. if neces- 
sary, killing people 1 am not so 
naive as to suggest we can do with- 
out an army, or to believe that we 
can bave an army which will never 
have to administer lethal force. But 
it is only through the political 
process lhat 1 can ensure lhat my 
government does not use my army 
to kill innocent people. 

In a country as openly democra- 
tic as ours, there can be no denying 
Ihe facts: If our government 
restricts our freedom, taxes us. or 
kills people, by not participating in 
the political process, we are implic- 
itly guilty of these actions. I, for 
one would rather look at the facts. 



then make my endorsement, or 
protest, explicitly. This seems to 
me to be the more human thing to 
do. 

Many people claim thai partici- 
pation in our political system is 
ineffective. That is why they don't 
vote and why they don't run for 
political office I argue that it is 
effective, but it is a long and com- 
plicated process which requires 
significant time and effort be put 
into it. To not participate in a 
process that determines what laws 
we will live under, how we will be 
taxed and who we will kill, 
because it is too much trouble, 
leaving these decisions to others 
instead, is not an acceptable solu- 
tion to me. This is why I am inter- 
ested in politics. 

When you feel, as I do. that it is 
not only one's right, but also one's 
duty to help regulate our govern- 
ment, then you begin lo see politi- 
cal action as an obligation. I have 
always lold my friends thai if you 
do not support an incumbent candi- 
date or the opposition for a certain 
office, then you have a duty to pub- 
licly announce your ideas and be 
wilting lo accept Ihe responsibility 
if it is given lo you. Having decid- 
ed I had better "put up" or risk 
being lold lo "shut up." I hereby 
announce my candidacy for the 
Republican nomination lo 
Indiana's fourth congressional dis- 
trict seal in the United Stales 
House of Representatives.

ll but Bearcats win it all 




Well basketball fans, it's almost 
time to settle into ibe old la/yboy, 
crack open a cold one and st( for 
four straight days. That's right 
folks, it's only a maiter of days until 
ihe greatest show on earth begins, 
March Madness 

It is ihe only "holiday" on which 
you can gamble illegally in your 
office and then call in sick for two 
straight days watching those crucial 
first-round games on Thursday and 
Friday. 

Universities and businesses alike 
might as well shut down because 
everyone stays home anyway lo fin- 
ish filling in those valuable learn 
brackets before the first tip-off. 
And making those bold predictions 
can sometimes require another day 
away from work or school in order 
to really be able to concentrate 
while picking the major upsets and 
the eventual champion, 

It really is a challenge to find 
that team like Oklahoma State or 
Florida that could gel around tour- 
nament time and make a run to the 
Final Four to held in the 
Meadowlands Arena this year. So 
without further delay here are my 
slab in the dark predictions for this 
year's final Four and who will win 
il all. 

From the Midwest bracket il is 
hard to bet against Kentucky, but 
I'm going with Villanova. Kerry 
Kittles is a superstar capable of car- 
rying the Wildcats and ihey have 
enough inside strength to provide 
serious problems for Kentucky. 
Lasi year. I also picked Villanova to 
advance lo the final Four so this is 
my "Lazarus" pick of the tourna- 
ment They can rise from last 
year's disappointment 10 make 
amends for their first-round exit. 

The Southeasl region is the 
strongest of the four brackets so 
there will definitely be upsets 
galore One of those upsets will be 
Eastern Michigan beating 
Connecticut, therefore opening the 
door for Cincinnati lo advance lo 
the Final Four. The Bearcats' great 
defensive play as well as their 
coach Bob Huggins make for a 
poteni combination in the tourna- 
ment. Couple that with their explo- 
sive offense and the Bearcats will 
easily advance. 

The sympathetic choice in ihe 
West regional would be the home-

Boilermakers, 
but they just 
are not that 
good Even 
with Kansas 
in this region, 
I look for the 
Memphis 
Tigers to sur- 
JmWT prise their 

opposition 
The Tigers 
play much the 
same style of 
ball as Cincinnati only wiih more 
power from the center position wiih 
Lorenzen Wrighl This is an expe- 
rienced team that reached ihe 
"Sweet Sixteen" last year and lhal 
should provide some extra incentive 
for this year's team, which is virtu- 
ally unchanged. 

The East regional was the hard- 
esl to predict wiih such power- 



house teams as Massachusetts and 
Georgetown. So I boldly predicted 
neither and decided on Marquette 

Every Final Four needs a dark 
horse and this is iL Marquette fin- 
ished the season strong and is 
primed to surprise some people just 
as Oklahoma State did last season 
They have a strong inside game 
with Amal McCaskill and are a 
very disciplined ball club that does 
not commit many turnovers in cru- 
cial situations. 

After much deliberation on the 
Championship game I decided the 
decision isn't that difficult 
Cincinnati will face Villanova in 
what should be a great game, but 
Ihe Bearcats defense will be too 
strong for Kerry and the 'Cats So 
the final score will be Cincinnati 
83, Villanova 77. with the Bearcats

ment MVP honors

Dons upset at regional tourney 



by Jim Porter 
Sports Editor 

The word* of women's basket- 
ball coach Pam Bowden are still 
laced with disappointment After 
posting a school record with 23 
wins this seaon, the 'Dons were 
upset at the Great Lakes regional 
tournament in Louisville, Ken 

"In the second half we got up by 
nine points and I thought, we were 
OK," Bowden said "Then, they 
called a time out and I think we lost 
it psychologically." 

The Lakers decided to utilize a 
box-and-one defense that rattled 
the 'Dons. When not getting beat 
for important rebounds, the team 
was losing the ball out of bounds or 
making mental mistakes 

"For whatever reason we didn't 
do what we need to do in the sec- 
ond half." Bowden said. 

The 'Dons allowed the Lakers 
to take control of the game with an 
11-0 scoring run and bold on to 
win the game 79-71. 

The loss ended a very successful 
year for the Mastodons with a 23-5 
record It was the only time all sea- 
son that the 'Dons lost in their 
while uniforms, li was also the first 
time all year that the team lost a 
game after leading ai halftime 

"ft is irritating because in the 
last month I think we got a little 
coms'laceni with things," Bowden 
said 'They were trying hard but I 
am m ure that we really had what 
it take &gt; finish" 

Although the coach and her 
team are dissatisfied with the 



result, the trip to the regional tour- 
nament did provide the team with a 
lot of positives. 

"I think this serves as a wake-up 
call for next year," Bowden said 
"We have to learn to live up to our 
expectations and not just be satis- 
fied with everyone telling us we 
had a great season ." 

According to Bowden the expe- 
rience of going 10 the tournament 
will be an asset for next season. 

"It gives us an insight to what it 
is all about." Bowden said. "We 
got a taste of winning this year and 
we can come back to thai ," 

According to Bowden the team 
plateaued with the 14-0 start to the 



season and never got any further 

"We need to continue to 
progress in the right direction and 
have the confidence to go out on 
the floor and expect to win games." 
Bowden said "We cannot be satis- 
fied with a 14-0 record I want us 
to go to the Bile Eight and be com- 
petitive." 

Although this season came to an 
abrupt end. next year the 'Dons 
look to be just as competitive. The 
icam loses AIl-American Lindy 
Jones and post player Tara 
Muzzillo, but Bowden sees the 
future as very exciting for her pro- 
gram.
