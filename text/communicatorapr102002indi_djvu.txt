Lecture 
reveals 
Jefferson, 
Hemings 
legacy 

By Jcnni/er Hunlley, Staff VVrilcr 

Shannon Lanier and Jane 
Fcldman visited IPFW on 
Friday to give a talk and slide 
show presentation to an audi- 
ence oi over 100 abnul tlie his- 
tory of the Thomas Jefferson 
and Sally Hemi;igs legacy. 

The lecture was loliowed 
by a book signing of the pair's 
new book, "Jefferson's 
Cltildren: The Story of One 
Amen can Family." 

Lanier is a diiecl descen- 
dent of Jefferson and his slave 
Hemings. Lanier is a 22-ycar 
old majoring in communica- 
tion at Kent Slate University. 
He plans to graduate in 
December and go on to gradu- 

Feldman is a photojournal- 
ist who has authored several 
children's books. 



Jefferson/Hemings descen- 
dants. Pail of their research cen- 
tered on interviews wiOi many 
of Jefferson's descendants. 
Feldman mentioned Ihal 
nd Lanier had I 



the Oprah Winfrey show and 
CSPAN and had been tecog- 
nizcd by the Commonwealln 



"[ am very, very pleased 
that the many sponsors were 
able to come together to pro- 
vide ihe community with an 
opportunity ID learn about the 
American family known 
as the Jcffersons," Heidi 
Saliba said. 

Feldman said that Ihey did 
all of the research and writing 
together. Some of the informa- 
tion highlighted Included the 
differences in age, gender and 
race betivecn Jefferson and 
Hemings. They discussed 
some ofthe history and organ- 
ized il in order to show many 
aspects of Ihe current debate. 

i-anier said that he realizes 
Ittal hi5 family is "setting an 
enamplc" for the nation, How 
(he situation Is resolved will 
affect race relations. 

"We're still )ust a regular 
family. We have love, and we 
have fights sometimes," he 
said. He sees the media cover- 
age of his family as "an oppor- 
tunit)' Id make a difference and 
shosv the world how to get along 
regardless of skin compleslon." 

Lanier and Feldman point- 
ed out that the current debate 
is whether or not Ihe Hemings 
descendants can be buried m 
the Monti cello graveyard, 
although very few ol thcoi actu- 
ally want to be buried there. 

According to Feldman, "the 
graveyard is more about blood 
and acceptance than where 
anybody is actually buried." 

Both Lanier and Feldman 
agree that the main reason 
they wrote Ihe book and 
embarked on a lecture tour 
was to open a dialogue about 
ract^ and discrimination, 

"The truth is ready to come 
out, and there Is no holding il 



on a discussion," said Lanier. 
According to Feldman, 

"Racism is aUve and well in 
America because wedon't want 
to talk about it. It is essential for 
us losee ttte commoiuti ties, but 
we also need to acknowledge 
the individuality" Ignoruig our 
differences only adds fuel to Ihe 
Ere, she added.

she is interested in ancestral 
tiislory and was "really exdt- 
ed to nave someone of nation- 
al Importance come to IPFW." 
She said Ihe lecture was txith 
historically significant as well 
as important to race relaticns.

When you don't vole, you are hindering thi*

widespread than simply a republic of the voting elite 

If you don't eicrdse your right to vole, Ihati you

s staff editorial by Todd Har 
say ttiat coach Bob Knight is 

vith Krughl as coach, Indiaj 



Who 

I has accomplished' 

On thecourt.with Krughl as coach, Indiana won nearly 73 percent of its games, and with more llian 
i. Knight is one of the winningesl NCAA coaches of all-lime. During his 29 yeara 
I. he led the Hoosiers to three national titles. The only coaches with more NCAA championship 
'rings ate UCLA's John Wooden (10) and Kentuck/s Adolph Rupp (4). The Knight-led 1975-76 IndLma 
squad is still the last team to firtish a season undefeated (32-0) and wm Ihe national title. Knight also 
—ached the USA men's basketball team to a gold metal in the 1984 Olympics. 

Off the court, Kni^l donated more money lo Blooming Ion- area chanties than most of us will make 
a lifetime, including S5 million lo the Indiana University Library alone. Of Ihe players that stayed ail 
ur vears at Indiana, all but two earned degrees. Knight also raised hundreds of thousands of dollan 
help Ljndon Turner when the player was paralyzed from the waist down in a car accident. Ask 
lof the players that stayed at Indiana and graduated, and Ihey will tell their own stories about this 
' n heard of side of Knight. 

Sure, Knight did some things that weren't so great. He assaulted a Puerto Rican policerun al 
1979 Pan American Games. He tossed tus chait onto the court after receiving a technical foul in a 1985 
game against Purdue, He allegedlv head-butted Sherron Wijkerson (it looked accidental lo me). He 
■allegedly kicked his son Pat in the snin durmg a Hmeout (Pat has even said Ihat his father merely kicked 
^the leg of the chair on which Pat was sittmg). And he choked Neil Reed [watch Ihe video al normal 
^ speed, it lasted a whoppmg two seconds). 

1 do agree that Indiaru is doing well without Krughl, bul why did you refer to liim as "en-Coach?' 
/asanex-coach for about six months, bul the "ex" was dropped once he signed wilh Tenas Tech (Uie 
iRed Raiders finished 23-8 this season). 

i just think ifs a shame that people like Kamm focus so much on Knight's faults and call him 
vtl,"and they fail to recogruTe the General's greatness. Knighl certainly loses his lempei 
; Ls far from evil.

Health Matters 



By Brandon Schwarze 



The first column ol this senes talked about 
the penis of perfonnine unsafe ie\- In Ihat col- 
umn, points werp made Ihal using a condom, 
preferably latex, could protect aga inst many 
Sexually Transmitled Diseases (STDs). In Ihis 
in. we'll lalfc a little bit more about what 
of STDs you could be confronted with 
when having unprolecled sex. 

Si Us can be separated into two categories. 
viral and bacterial. 

Perhaps the mosi well known bacterial 
STDs include chlamydia, gonorrhfj and syphilis. 

Chlamydia may not show any signs at Hrsl, 
especially in women. The later signs for women 
may Include itching of the surrounding an^as of 
the vagina, a yellow discharge from the same 
and pain during intercourse. Women may also 
have bleeding behveen periods or a dull pain in 
the pelvic area, [n men. such signs may include 
pam or burning while urinating and watery dis- 
charge from the penis. 

Gonorrhea is also known as "the clap" and 
have a thick, yellow discharge 
from the penis and pain when urinating. The hp 
o( the penis may also be sore. In women, a 
white, green or yellow discharge from the vagi- 
na may exist. Such symptoms as pain while 
urinating or heavy bleeding may also be pres- 
ent. In the event "the dap" was contracted 
while performing oral or anal sen, either a sore 
throat or rectum may be Ihe end result. 

Syphilis, rraponsible for the demise and 
dementia of Al Capone, has an early sign of a 
chancre sore, Ttie sores may appear on areas 
touched during intercourse. The glands near the 
chancre may swell. A few months later, one may 
develop a fever, sore throat, headaches, loss of 
appetite or pint pain. The symplomr can then 
pass and you may not have a relapse for several 



7^e secrnd calcgorj- ol ?rt)s are viral m lutme 
and consist ol scene disease many mav ha\-c 
already heaidol, but hope ttwyrei-er^. Hepatitis 
B, fierpes. human immunodeiioaicN' virus are] 
human papiUoma^ijus are three vira! STDs. 

HepahtLs B mav include such symptoms as 
muscles aches, fever, tiredness and a loss of 
appetite as well as dizziness. As the disease 
worsens, you may have dark urine, loose or 
li^l colored stools, tenderness in the liver area 
and yellow eyes and skin. 

Hepatitis B can be fatal, leading to liver 
disease or liver cancer. 

Herpes starts with a tinglmg or itching 
around the genilab. Small blulers may form 
and then open. The sores turn to scabs. During 
the first outbreak, there may be swollen glands. 
fever and body aches. Outbreaks may occur for 
the rest of your life, but may become less frxv 
quenl and less painful. 

Perhaps the most ivell known and most 
feared is human immunodeficiency vuus, or 
HIV. HIV causes AIDS. The body's obllity to 
fight off disease with the immurw system is 
compromised. As time goes by, illnesses can no 
longer be fought off. The symptona may take 
years to develop and may include unusual 
infection, fatigue and iveight loss. 

The human papillomavirus, or HPV, can 
cause a growth of soft, flesh colored warls 
,iround Ihe genital area or the cervin. The warb 
are painless, but can be annoying because of the 
way they look. 

If you think you have any of these symp- 
loms. or other symptoms that you think may be 
related to a sexually liansmilted disease, you 
should see a health care provider for teslmg.

Lafayette artist to unveil portrait 



WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (PU new?) — An 
interna lion ally renoivncd artist who began his 
career with caricatures of his Lafayette high 
Khool teachers, moved on lo Catholic cardinals 
and esecutives and now has caphired Purdue 
University's ninth president on canvas. 

The portrait of Purdue President Emerilus 
SiL'ven C. Beering (vill be unveiled during the 
MevcnC. Beering Hallof Uberal Arts and Education 
dedicabon at 2 p.m. Fnday. April 12 in Foimders 
Park on the university's We&amp;\ Lafayette campus. 

The artist, Richard Halslead, tells how as a 
youngboy he had a hard lime paying attention in 
class. Instead, he preferred to draw caricatures of 
his teachers. One teacher caught him in the act, 
confiscated his drawing, then look it home and 
hung il on his o&gt;«i wall 

Marjorie Halstead. just happened lo have a 
portrait that her son had painlea hanging on her 
apartment wall, Henry Rosenthal, longtime 
broadcaster and former owner of WA5K Radio 



and WFAM-TV, was struck by the painlmc, mis- 
taking its lifelike qualities for a pholograph, 

impressed by Halslead's work. Rosenthal 
contacled Beering and his wife. Jane, to suggest 
they view Ihc artist's work and consider Halstead 
for rendering the portrait of Beering thai will be 
displayed in the newly renamed building on Ihe 
West Lafayette campus. 

Halstead graduated from Lafayette Jefferson 
High School and attended summer courses al 
Purdue. He descnbcs his greatest artistic influ- 
ences as the works of Rembrandt and Holbein, 
but credits his shjdy of art history at Purdue lor 
spurring his early ambitions as an artist. 

"The best arl history course 1 had as a student 
was during the summer al Purdue," Halslead said, 
"1 have fond memoriesol Ihe university, since both 
of my pan:nts wert! active alumni. It is an honor and 
a thrill lo have my work displayed al such a highly 
respected in'"

A successhil inaugural season and signs of 

promising growth have Head Coach Lynn Vardaman 

very exdtcd about the future of IPFW hockey team. 

The Maslodon leam is now bepnning preparation 

for its sophomore season as they lind themselves in a new 

conference and wilh a significantly larger schedule. 

"We'rc shooting for 50 games next year," says 
Vjnljiiun To undergo such a huge task of competing m so 
many games, Vardaman hopes to possibly 
have two learns nent year Vardaman's plans 
are to provide hjs teams with enough play- 
ers in order to pie\'ent a shortage during 
times that players are unable to maie ramcs. 
He IS also very optimistic aboul IPfW's 
chance lo be very competitive wilh a sched- 
ule that may place them up against other top 
Sjality teams such as Indiana, Purdue and 
hio Slate. TTie Maslodons will now be 
member of the TVi -Stale Hockey Conference 
which includes Toledo, BowlinECreen. Ohio 
Stale, Purdue and Kentucky. TTieir confer- 
ence will be a part of Ihe Southeast division 
of the American Collegiate Hockey 
Association (ACHA). 

However, the Dons will have their 
work cut out for them. Lasl year, all (our of 
the semi-hnal teams m Ihe national tourna- 
ment came out of their divisiorL 

Delenseman Skip Elmer feels the leam 
will be extremely competitive and believes 
they have a chance at reaching Ihe touma- 
menl. "We have some really talented players 




In order to qualify for the national 
Maslodons would need to finis 

Vardaman also believes that goal is attainable. "1 think

after we have our leam pul together, well sil dmvn and discuss our 
goals." says Vardaman, "I think ours will be to make nadonals." 

The team will firsi have a meeting on Sunday. April 14 
m Walb Student Union, Room 114 to galher the inlerest of 
new players. The team is also asking lor a turnout ol non- 
players who would be interested in joining the club at a cost

cets and volunteers and lo help with the team in a variety of
