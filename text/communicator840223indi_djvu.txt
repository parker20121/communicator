Increased revenues

George Bullion, chairman of the 
business and economics department, 
feels that the lottery Is not regressive 
taxing because it is a very voluntary 
action lo buy a lottery ticket. 

Judith lnaiu. assistant professor of 
psychological sciences, agrees thai Ihe 
lottery Is voluntary. She said lower-

The most visible advantage of Ihe

to Improve education in Indiana 

The bill was sponsored by Phyllis

Incentives lo schools for decreasing

dergarten through third. 

Pond said if the bill Is passed by the 
General Assembly it will provide a cash

lhat reduce sludent-leacher ratios to 18- 

The bill also makes provisions I 
school systems lhat do not have room to

CAGE 1 - THE COMMUNICATOR - FEBRUARY Z3. 19W 



Disaster avoided 



A potential disaster was avoided Feb. 
13 when the waters or the St. Joseph 
Ki'.it threatened to Flood the Walb 
Memorial Union. 

At 2:55 p.m., Gene Hadl, manager of 
the cafeteria, informed Dun Hotter, 
director of the physical plant, that 
flooding was taking place in the loading 
dock area of the Walb 

Water backed into the storm sewer 
system when an ice jam on the river 
prevented water from going further 

Katter and his crew reacted quickly 
and put the flood prevention system to 
work. The system did its job and a flood 
was avoided. 

The flood prevention system w 



stalled in January 1993 after 30 inches of 
water flooded the basement of the Walb 
in March 1982. 

Many of us may remember events 
after the 1982 flood. The cafeteria was 
closed for the remainder of the 
semester. When the kitchen opened in 
the fall of 1382, the food was served in the 
Mulu-Purpose Building. The smell in 
thai building would be enough to turn 
anyone's appetite. 

Because of the flood prevention 
system, no classes were cancelled and 
the semester wasn't disrupted. IPFW 
students pay too much money to attend 
classes to have any cancelled because of 
inlhoSI.JosephRiver 



Support needed 



The men's basketball team closes out 
lis home season with games tonight and 
Saturday. 

The team is currently riding on a four- 
game winning streak. A victory tonight 
over cross-town rival St. Francis would 
insure a lie of last season's record- 
setting 16 victories. 

While The Communicator may not 
agree with everything the athletic 
department does, we believe a strong 
and viable inter-collegiate athletic 
program will go a long way towards 
increasing the visibility of the school. A 
strong program however needs 
dedicated supporters. 

Each of the various teams have loyal 



supporters, but they need a larger I 
of support. One source of support the 
athletic department doesn't tap enough 
is the student body. Most students 
probably don't know they can get into 
games free with their IPFW iden 

Opposing coaches have brought teams 
to IPFW and have praised the facilities 
and the program, however those same 
coaches must have thought they were 
having a glorified practice. 

Developing a large following takes 
time. Maybe the athletic department 
should work with various student 
organizations (fraternities, sororities, 
students' government, etc. ) to gel 
students to the games.
