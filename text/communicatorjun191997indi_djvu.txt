Trees rapidly disappearing from IPFW 




By Nol Beckley 
Editor 



Several trees and shrubs have been 
removed to clear the way for a new 
road which will lead into the uni- 
versity from Crescent Avenue. 

Many of the trees being removed out- 
line a creek which flows through campus 
and under Crescent. 

The removal has nothing lo do with the 
dike system being constructed in Fort 
Wayne by the Army Corps of Engineers, 
said Walter Branson, vice chancellor of 
financial affairs. 

"There are no plans at all (to participate 
in the Fort Wayne levee project)," 
Branson said, referring to the massive 
project in Fort Wayne 

He added lhat less man half of the 
foliage would have to be removed for this 
projecL 

"In general, a typical large tree has 
thousands of miles of roots that stabilize 
the ground Rip-rapping a creek only sta- 
b i 1 i z e s 
where you 
can see the 
rocks . . . 



Another drawback is that this will 
worsen flooding downstream and increase 
sedimentation, Fleming said. 

Trees moderate soil temperature and 
provide shade for riverside organisms, 
removing the trees will harm the riverside 
biology, Fleming said. 

"I was disappointed to see some of that 
go and see the removal. I did see this as a 
loss," said Bruce Kingsbury, assistant 
professor of biology. 

Kingsbury also said the creek acts as a 
corridor for wildlife to move across the 
campus He said many animals will not 
move across open territory and when this 
corridor is removed they will not travel 
across campus 

"I think anything that removes a little 
bit of lhat (the trees) at a time hurts the 
ecosystem," Kingsbury said. 

Kingsbury also said he was concerned 
about the "thermal mosaic" that will be 
eliminated when the tree canopy is 
removed. This will hurt the area's ability 
to cool itself. 

Trees evaporate water and cool the area

creating a liny ecosystem thai supports a 
variety of wildlife. 

When a tree dies and falls over, often 
lhat process will weaken the dike. The 
root network pulls at the foundation of the 
levee system, Kingsbury said. 

"From an engineering standpoint, it 
(removing the trees) makes sense," 
Kingsbury said. 

He also expressed reservations that the 
wildlife will be harmed and dieir ecosys- 
tem disturbed. 

Tbe parking garage plans were 
approved 30 months ago and construction 
started after the end of the spring semes- 

When the proposal was being dis- 
cussed, several student senators said they 
were afraid the basis for selecting the 
location of the new parking garage would 
be to help with overflow parking from 
Gates Sports Center and to nol benefit the 
majority of students 

The IPSGA had amended their 
approval to say they wanted the parking 
garage to be built on the south side of the 
library 

The parking 
garage was orig- 
inally approved 
to help alleviate 
tbe parking 
problem during 
the construction 
of tbe science 
budding. Nearly 
200 spaces were 
lost when 
ground was bro- 
ken for the sci- 
ence building. 

The adminis- 
tration said then 
that they expect- 
ed the north side 
of the campus to 
expand dramati- 
cally in the next 
couple of years

or three campus 
buildings would

Library receives Foelllnger grant, plans to raise $1.5 million by next year 



By Nol Beckley 
Editor 

On Monday, Judith Violette, director of 
Lbc Helmke Library, said at a press confer- 
ence that students wdl have greater elec- 
tronic information access than ever. 

"Everyone wins with this shared access 
project." Violeite said "Students will 
become more effecuve information users." 

The conference officially kicked off the 
$ 1 .5 million campaign aimed to bolster the 
library's strengths and develop new elec- 
tronic services for students and the rest of 
northeast Indiana. 



"Tbe library is tbe center of the univer- 
sity's existence This campaign is important 
to us and the library and the community," 
Chancellor Michael Wanell said. 

"We need to support a wide array of 
electronic systems," Violette said. 

The SI 5 million shared access project's 
goals are to "estabbsh endowed funds and 
direct gifts to ensure a strong collection of 
books, journals and digitized information; 
create an electronic training center in 
Helmke Library for use by IPFW students 
and those who share m IPFW's efforts and 
belief in the development of shared access 
to electronic resources; and establish a cen- 



tralized computer- ope rat ions area to pro- 
vide shared access to databases among 
libraries m the region." 

Tbe Focltinger Foundation pledged to 
contribute $347,844 for the project, but 
only if contributions total SI million. 

"Our board fell this project was a good 
fit with our grant-making priorities. We 
emphasize grants that benefit children, 
youth and families in Allen County, and ibis 
project provides students and their families 
throughout our community with new ways 
to learn," said Barbara Burt, president of 
the Foellinger Foundation, in a written 
statement 



"We hope this grant will provide a 
strong incentive for individuals, businesses 
and foundations to support this important 
community effort," she added 

"They were very generous with this 
challenge granL" Wanell said. 

Wiib the grant, the campaign has 
acquired more than half of (be goal in a 
short time. The campaign will conclude by 
next summer 

"We have already reached over 
$900,000. We are going to raise at least, if 
not more than, the SI .5 million for the cam- 
paign," said Bill Black, volunteer chair, 
campaign for Helmke Library. 



If tbe library reaches its fund-raising 
goal, it will upgrade ihe information system 
to allow IPFW to access the Allen County 
Public Library through computers in 
Helmke Students should be able to do more 
extensive research said Suzanne 
Ecblenkamp, a member of tbe Helmke 
Library Committee member 

This is tbe third fund-raising campaign 
for the library Tbe first, in 1969, to acquire 
40,000 books and supply capital improve- 
ment funds for the library, raised SI. 5 mil- 
lion and the second, in 1982, raised SI mil- 
lion. Both previous campaigns successfully 
reached ihe goals.

From dark basements and back alleys to storefront neon signs, tatto 
ing has finally become legal in Fort Wayne and the rest of Indiana. 

Tbe Allen County Board of Zoning Appeals decided that many of 
underground body artists can take their craft public even in formerly resi- 
dential neighborhoods. 

Tattoo studios will now be able to advertise publicly raiher than rely 
on word of mouth to keep their trade alive. 

Tbe Indiana General Assembly distanced tattooing from practicing 
medicine with a law that lakes effect on July 1. 

Several tattoo parlors have began to spring up around town, including 
one on Wells Street and another on Lowct Huntington Road. 

According to one body artist, tattooing was never against the law. but 
Indiana never had any regulations or procedures concerning il 

Tbe new law requires customers to be 18 or have their parent present. 



The Senate Foreign Relations Commin.ee approved a plan to pay 
most of the debt owed to the United Nations, bul only if the world body 
agrees to cut its budget and adopts extensive organizational change. 

Indiana Senator Richard Lugar argued that we have no right to 
impose conditions of payment on a legitimate debt. The argument fell on 
deaf cars because tbe Jesse Helms, R-N.C. lead measure has enough 
votes to push tbe plan through. 

Lugar said most of the S819 milium owed is not owed to the U.N.. 
but to friendly nations like France and Britain who have deployed troops 
supporting US forces on peacekeeping missions 

U.N, Secretary General Kofi Annan said, "It will be a real test for 
U.S. diplomacy There is nothing that says the Congress simply will dic- 
tate to the United Nations. My sense is that ihe United Stales will have 
to come here and negotiate."

Staff Editorial 



Flag debate comes back 
around to challenge freedoms 



Tbe always controversial 
flag-burning amendment 
passed the House of 
Representatives last week and with 
il comes the American Civil 
Liberties Union and every other 
free speech advocate in the coun- 
try. 

The Communicator believes in 
what tbe ACLU is fighting for as 
we all should The free speech 
given to us by the ^^_^^^^_ 
Constitution not ~ 



only protects 
written word, but 
also free expres- 
sion. 

If someone 
satisfies their 
need for self- 
expression by 
burning the flag, 
should thai act 
merit being con- 
victed of a feder- 
al crime? In Nazj 
Germany, tbe 
Third Reich 
passed a similar 
law to restrict tbe 
freedoms of their 

people. They leg- 

is I aied patriot ism ■ 

We believe 
thai patriotism should come from 
the heart not some law or constitu 
tional amendment. Wouldn't an 
amendment be contrary to every 
thing the founding fathers stood 
for? They fought the British 
Empire for the exact freedoms we 
are now trying to restrict. 

The flag is only a symbol of 
what our country is founded upon. 



In Nazi 

Germany, the 

Third Reich 

passed a similar 

law to restrict 

the freedoms of 

their people. 



It is easily identified and holds a 
patriotic power over most of us. 
But when lawmakers who are mak- 
ing restrictive decisions in 
Washington attempt to deny us that 
freedom, we need to stand up and 
Tight for what the flag stands for If 
that means burning it, so be it. 

Let us explain that we do not 
condone flag burning It really 
serves no purpose, but to criminal- 
^^^^^^^^ izc it is ludicrous. 

' We must think 

about what 
Congress is 
doing We must 
realize that even 
though no one 
wants to see the 
flag burned, we 
cannot afford to 
limit the free- 
doms we are 
endowed with by 
our Creator and 
Constitution. 

If we 
forget these free- 
doms, then our 
only alternative is 
to become mind- 

less sheep, fol- 

^^^^^^^^ lowing our lead- 
ers who are lead- 
ing us to the slaughter Sadly, most 
of us would follow because of the 
state of our country today. 

Anything that has the scent of 
law and order smells good on the 
outside, without even considering 
whether this is rancid on the inside. 

Do we really want to pay the 
price of freedom and privacy for 
law and order?

Presidents motives 
challenged, debated 



With President Clinton's 
launch to improve race 
relations this weekend 
we are questioning whether his 
motives were genuine. 

During his daughter's gradua- 
tion. Clinton issued a challenge to 
build "the world's first truly mul- 
tiracial democracy ." On Saturday 
Clinton emphasized in a speech to 
San Diego graduates bis priorities 
of affirmative action and diversity 
His scheme was to ease racial ten- 
sions and expand opportunities for 
minorities 

During the last election Clinton 
did not widely promote bis new 
visions of race unity. While be did 
condemn racism dunng the elec- 
tion, be spoke no harsh comments 
about California and Proposition 
209 (which would have ended 
Affirmative Action). Why? 

Because California was such an 
Important electoral factor, giving 
the winner almost 20 percent of the 
electoral vote Clinton kept bis 
ideas about affirmative action 
quiet, not wanting to arouse any 
differences with California voters 
who would mostly likely vote for 
bim and tbe issue of doing away 
with affirmative action. 



Now seven months after 
Proposition 209 was approved and 
Clinton was re-elected, be has 
brought to the country's attention 
his ideflsV and criticized California 
for their racial policies 

While every president is 
remembered for one thing or anoth- 
er we believe that not all of 
President Clinton's efforts are just 
for the bettering of the country. He 
wants to be known as the President 
who eliminated tbe barriers that 
separate the races, instead of the 
second Nixon 

But if his bean were in the 
right place, he would have stood 
strongly for this issue back in 1992 
and through the '96 election, not 
towards the latter pan of his career, 
when presidents are searching for 
something to be remembered by. 

We are not questioning the 
validity of his claim that we must 
end racism. We are not questioning 
whether ending racism will benefit 
the country. 

We are questioning his 
motives. We are questioning his 
reasoning. Whatever his motives 
are though, an end to racism in our 
lifetime would be something spe- 



Dr. Jack "the Dripper" 

KEVORKIAN smoked it when a mistrial was 
declared in his most recent "right-to-die" trial 
Kevorkian never even had to approach the stand 
because of his lawyers "inflammatory" opening 
statement. Kevorkian's lawyer accused the prose- 
cutor of altering the death certificate of Loretta 
Peabody. a 54-year-old multiple sclerosis patient. 

Major league baseball choked 

it when they allowed "lnterleaguc" play this year. 
Although it may experience a litde boost in tick- 
et sales, this is just a sad gimmick to try and heal 
the festering wound left over from the strike. 
Don't expect the honeymoon to last forever. 

The McVeigh jury smoked it when 

they found for the death penalty Too bad the only 
federal way to die is through lethal injection If he 
was convicted in an Indiana court, McVeigh 
would have been smoking in "old Sparky," 
Indiana's venerable electric chair. 

The Allen County Board of 
Zoning Appeals smoked u when they 

declared tattoos legal It's about time Many of us 
have tanoos and would have bated to go to jail for 
such a worthless crime. We thank the board for 
coming into the 20th century just three years 
before the 21st century. 

Michael Jordan smoked a victory 

cigar once again when he led the Bulls to their 
fifth title in seven years. He eve i managed to help 



one of his teammates, Steve Ken, move into bas- 
ketball history Without lordan the Bulls would 
have fallen hard. He is their soul. He is the pan of 
the Bulls that drives them and pushes them past 
their human potential. 

All of Washington choked on a 

multi-billion dollar aid package to flood-ravaged 
North Dakota and Minnesota. Both parties 
.seemed to try and turn this into a political war 
wilhoufrcaliyiny the .suffering of the those people 
who lost their homes and possessions. Nice job. 
Whatever happened to "by the people, of the peo- 
ple and for the people"? 

President Clinton smoked u when he 

proposed an apology to African Americans for 
slavery. It may be just a gesture, but il still needs 
to be heard. Now all he needs to do is look into 
the 40 acres and a mule thing and maybe White 
America will alone for 400 years of institutional- 
ized slavery. 

Its about lime THE GOVERNMENT 
smoked about Gulf War Syndrome After years of 
cover-up, a study by tbe General Accounting 
Office of Congress said the defense department 

should not rule out the possibility of biological 
weapons used by the Iraqis. The Pentagon dis- 
missed the possibility that the illnesses resulted 
from a tropical disease spread by parasites 

Investigators in the 

JonBenet Ramsey case have choked 

by making mistakes that may have destroyed the 



case. The inexperienced investigators refused 
help from the Denver Police Department and the 
FBI They faded to secure the crime scene, they 
failed to consider JonBenet's parents as possible 
suspects They were not skeptical enough of the 
kidnapping. They faded to follow basic procedure 
in questioning the parents And finally, they used 
the body as leverage against the parents to get an 
interview. 

Senate Majority Leader 

TRENT LoTT smoked it when he called the 
president a "spoiled brat" on national television. 
It's about time that politics returned to name call- 
ing and bear bating. Usually we have to wait until 
the presidential campaign. We like seeing this 
needless bickering going on. At least we are get- 
ting our money's worth. Lou will probably put up 
a belter fight than Bob Dole 

ERNIE ELS smoked il ai the US. Open 
this weekend. His consistent play is respectable 
and his humility is contagious. Maybe next year 
Tor Tiger Woods, We don't see any kids saying 
"I'm Ernie Els" in a Nike commercial in the 
future Oh well. Els' accomplishment should be 
applauded and we do. 

Sixty-eight percent of the 

American people choked it when they said in a 
poll that Watergate isn' t worse than any other cur- 
rent Washington scandal. Coneci us if we're 
wrong, but didn't Nixon try to rig an election and 
subvert the will of the people— a right guaranteed 
by The Constitution

A message from the editor 



to the campus 



To the campus: 

I am issuing a challenge to the 
students of this university. I chal- 
lenge you to do something with your 
college years Although I know 
many of you work full-tune and 
have famUies, there are ways for you 
to gel involved. 

You can spend a couple of hours 
a week in student's government It's 
not that hard. And from what 1 have 
seen in the pasi three years, they 
have quite a loi of fun doing what 
they're doing. They 
organize most of the 
events on campus 
and do so with litde 
appreciation The 
turnout is usually 
low. but that is not the 
fault of Ihe pcopl 
involved with I 
Student Activities 
Board or tbe 
Indiana-Purdue 
Student's 
Government 
Association. 

I've seen them 
work hard Being 
on the board or in 
the senate looks 
respectable on your 
resume. 



There are social fraternities that 
can help you find a niche. They can 
give you a sense of belonging and 
companionship. I've been a member 
of a fraternity at Ball State and I 
know they can do wonderful things. 
They can bring you out of your shell 
or help you make contact with tbe 
university. 

Another place lo feel welcome is 
this newspaper. The newspaper can 
give you a feeling of accomplish- 
ment because you get to see your 
name in the paper every 
week. If you write a col- 
you can get your face 
the 
p e r 




I used to come lo the campus, go 
to class and go home I was bored. I 
knew I needed to do something to 
become a pan of this university I 
didn't think I would be able to do it 
because I was a single parent who 
worked nearly full-time, but I did it. 
I stuck with it and became editor 
about seven months after I started. 

I've relished the opponunilies 
I've had at this paper I've met some 
of the most imponant people in my 
life here I've developed lasting 
friendships and have gained valuable 
experience in my field. 

I wish everyone could have the 
pleasant experience ai the paper that 
I have had Unfortunately, some do 
not Do not be discouraged If you 
feel the paper is not your cup of tea, 
try some of the other activities I 
ioned earlier. 

By the way did I mention thai 
The Communicator is hiring 
people for paid positions? The 
work isn't that hard and all 
you need is desire, dedication 
and writing skills. Our office 
is in Walb Suite 215. 1 hope to 
see you soon.

Early choices create problems, complete personal maturity 



outside Looking in: Gait RuBlc Crawford 




talking wiih two of my co-workers. 
We were discussing violence and I 
mentioned a PBS documentary (bat 
I bad watched about serial killers 

As conversations between 
friends usually do, the discussion 
followed all manner of crazy topic 
tangents and turned into a discus- 
sion about a news story that one of 
my co-workers had read that 
involved some Minnesota 
teenagers In (his incident, a group 
of teens had stolen several street 
signs one evening for "fun " 

One of the signs stolen was a 
STOP sign from a busy intersec- 
tion. As a result of the missing 
STOP sign, a car carrying two or 
three teens bad driven through the 
intersection without yielding and bit 



semi-truck broadside, killing the 
teens in the car, Now the "sign- 
stealers" arc not going to be finish- 
ing high scbool-tbeyll be facing 
manslaughter charges instead 

As sad as that story is, the three 
of us pondered similar, yet less 
deadly, things we had done at that 
same age It struck each of us pow- 
erfully to realize (bat we could have 
done something equally as stupid 
that could have bad an effect as 
painfully permanent. 

Luckily, none of us bad, but the 
point is we could have. After all, I 
know for a fac( that kids in this area 
steal signs. Now, 1 refuse to say bow 
I know this, but I do You'll just have 
to trust me on this At 16 or 17, 1 did 
things jusi to do tbcm, because I 
could do them, and never, ever 
thought about what would or could 
happen Heck, I was invincible 

Nothing bad would ever, ever 
happen to me 1 was gonna bve for- 
ever. Now that I'm an adult, I know 
that bad things do happen and they 
also happen to good people--and 
good kids, loo. 

Now, I'm a few years older and 
a little bit wiser (although my par- 



ents my yet disagree with that state- make are different I'm looking at 

ment), and I cannot believe some of decisions with a different perspec- 

the choices I made in the past But I live now-not with the eyes of a 

survived my teenage years and lived child, but with the ideas of a mamed 

to tell about them for one good rea- woman. These choices are just as 



son: / made some 
pretty good 
choices 

Okay, okay- 
it's supposed to be 
as simple as 
"good cboice = 
good outcome. 
bad cboice = bad 
outcome." But as 

we all know, ********* "■" wnw ywuu i^« works--an 
nothing is ever __„, i „„,j *»., understand- 

■bat simple Tien: son. J made some pretty ,„ g ^ omy 

are (hose pesky 
"other" factors 



I survived my teenage 

years and lived to tell 

about for one good rea- 



good choices 



life altering, 
but I make 
them wi(h a 
confidence 
and a broad- 
er under- 
standing of 
this big ol' 
world and 
how it 



choice is much more powerful, as 
there is much more on (be line My 
choices have to be weighed against 
more complicated (hings-how will 
this choice affect my marriage? My 
job? My education? My future? 

I want to make good choices, 
because I want to wake up 40 years 
from now and be able to face 
myself. I want to be proud of the 
choices I made. It's just too bad that 



I didn't think about my choices in 
ibis light when I was a teen. 

I'm really lucky If one of my 
choices had been wrong, if Lady 
Luck hadn't been on my side, some- 
one in an office somewhere could 
have been telling a story about what 
"thai girl" in Indiana did . . . and I 
really don't want to be the subject of 
office gossip. 



(if you believe in 

that type of gaBSS 
thing). Bui every- 
thing in life starts with a choice, and 
we all have the power to make good 
choices at any age 

Now that I'm finally in the 
"home stretch" of my college educa- 
tion, the choices that I'm forced to 



Clinton's seductions need some help 



Do the math: Nol BecHley 




R 



ecemly. 

Paula 
Jones 
won her case in 
front of (be 
Supreme Court- 
She will be able 
to pursue her 
charges of sexu- 
al harassment 



wishes to 
restore her "good name" and wish- 
es to have the president admi( his 
wrong-doing (if any) to her. Then 
she will be happy and all will be 
right with the world 

Even though 1 believe the 
Supreme Court made a mistake on 
allowing this "frivolous" suil to 
continue is wrong. 1 cannot fault 
their reasoning in such a loaded 
case. 1 would like to argue against 
her claim that this was sexual 
harassment. 

What is "sexual harassment?' I 
looked it up in the dictionary and 
couldn't find it. Since I already had 
a good idea what "sexual" meant (I 
have one child). I looked up the 
definition of harassment. 

The Webster's Dictionary 
defines harassment as "to trouble 
by repeated attacks; to disturb per- 
sistently; bother continually." From 
my understanding of wha( Jones 
said happened in that Arkansas 
hotel room. Clinton made small 
talk, dropped his pants, exposed the 
"Commander-in-Chief' and asked 
her for a sexual favor She said no. 
Bill pulled up his pants and con- 
cealed his "litile Bubba" behind his 
BVDs 

Nothing more was asked of 
Jones and Clinton never called on 
her again I have several problems 
with this account, but 1 wdl begin 
with the harassment issue. If she 
said "NO" and Clinton respected 
her wishes (hen what is the big- 
fu"tng deal 7 He didn't try to use 
his "drop-urou" lactic on her again. 
He didn'l fire her from whatever 
position she held. He didn't kick 
her ou( of (he trailer park. He didn't 
use his "official" capacity to hurl 
her at all. 

The other problem I have with 
Jones' account is tact If the presi- 



dent, as the Republicans want us to experience that he jus( drops his 
believe, is such a womanizer how pants and expects every woman io 
could he conquer so many women drop lo (heir knees. I don'l think so 



with so utile 
skill? 

I don't 
know a hel- 
luva lol 
about 
women, but 
even I know 
(bat just 
dropping 
your pants m 
a bote! room 
is tacky. I 
think if he 
was (he 
womanizer 
th at ihe 
Republicans 
think he is. 
be would 
have ai leasi 
bough( her a 

dinner They 

were in a 

hotel, they 

could have ordered room service. 
They could have had someone get a 
botde of Mad Dog or something to 
gel in the mood. How aboyt flow- 
ers? 

I have never beard of any man 
who has used this "bull rush" lactic 
to seduce a woman Usually the tac- 
tics I have beard start with at the 
very leas I a kiss. 

We are to believe that the man 
who runs our country has so little 



We are to believe 

that the man who 

runs our country 

has so little 

experience that 

he just drops his 

pants and expects 

women to drop 

to their knees. 



Do you ihink a 
liberated 
woman like 
Hillary Clinton 
would have 
stayed with him 
if the president 
bad done that 
on their first 
dale? 

Jones 
said all she 
wants to do is 
restore her sul- 
lied name. 
Didn't she have 
a "good name" 
(whatever that 
means) before 
sbe came for- 
ward with ihese 
charges? 

^_^— — If she 

and her 

Republican 
supporters were so concerned with 
her rep. why was she thrust into the 
forefront of the debate? 

I may be wrong, the president 
may have no skill when it comes to 
women. But I like (o think he's like 
Kennedy in some respects. 
Kennedy had Marilyn Cunton has 
Paula Jones Think about it and do 
the math.

Balancing the cloning debate 

Balancing tpe cloning debate 



BT NOL BECKLEV 

EoiTon 



On Jut* 9, the National Btoeinic 
Advisory Commission (NBAC recom- 
rm-ndcd Ui President L tin ion tlui fr.'.umi, 
a child through cloning should be prohib- 
ited. 

The first, conclusion the NBAC 
readied u that "at tfiis tunc if. ls morally 
unacceptable lur anyone ijo iJh public or 
private sector? whether in a research or 
clinical setung, to attempt to create a child 
using somatic cell nuclear transfer Cloning 
We have r evened n cmne run ■. On this point 
_ t of ipeuiBckni infonnauon on the 
y"and efTeitivcness oT this method in 
humans. 

"It would violate important 
ethical obligations were clini- 
cians or researchers to attempt to 
create a child using these particu- 
lar technologies, which are likely 
to involve substantial risk to the 
fetus and/or the potential child in 
addition many other serious ethical 
concerns have been identified, 
which require much more wide- 
spread and careful public 
deliberation before this 
technology may be used. 
The NBAC request- 
ed the ban on cloning 
Clinton enacted three 
months ago remain 
in effect. The com- 
mission also 
requested that all 
pnvate businesses 
compl y i 
Clinton's ban 
However, 
islation banning 
cloning should be 
reviewed after 
three to five 
years to see if 
the prohibiliOD 
should be 
contin- 
ued Any 
stale leg- 
islation 
should also 
include Ibis 
clause, the NBAC 
said. 

NBAC decided efforts to clone a 
human now would not be safe because 
there is too great a risk for a malformed 
fetus 

One member of the commission, 
Retaugb G. Dumas, vice provost for health 
affairs at the University of Michigan said, 
*1 could make the moral argument thai if 
these techniques are available and we don't 
use them, we are letting society down. It is 
immoral not to have access to the best 
technology we could muster. It would be a 
shame to prohibit cloning forever. 

The commission admitted that cloning 
will require an advisory board similar to 
the NBAC to monitor and review the field, 
update existing guidance, and suggest new 
guidelines to cover events the NBAC can- 
not foresee. 

There were three fears to cloning thai 
people are concerned about, the committee 
reported 

One fear people have is cloning repre- 
sents an attempt to determine almost the 
complete genotype of the clone. This is a 
change from the genetic "lottery" that 
takes place in sexual reproduction. 

The second fear is that cloning would 
disrupt the orderly sequence of genera- 
tions and lineage. 

A third fear is that some people's ego 
and narcissism would reinforce the idea 
that individuals are independent and 
would not need to depend on other people 
for reproduction. No longer would people 
have to enter into a cooperative relation- 
ship for procreation. 

The commission was careful 
to point out that in ineir recom- 
mendation to ban human cloning 
that it would not interfere with 
other important areas of scientific 
research. 

Local musings 

Cecil Baker, senior, biology 
major, said be believes experi- 
menting with animals has many 
positive results, but he's worried 
about the questions (he latest will 
bring up. 

"New technology will make 
things better for the next genera- 
tion, but new technology creates 
decisions we didn't have to make 
20 years ago," he said. 

"It opens certain door and 
opens other doors that maybe we 
don't want to see what's behind 
Ihem." Baker added. 

Regulation is the key accord- 
ing to Don Korimick, associate 
professor of pharmacology and 
toxicology 



Kontnick said be thinks there should 
be definite limitations about what cloning 
could be used for. 

"It's wise to put some guidelines 
because technology runs somewhat ahead 
of what our mentality can envision," be 
said. He also asked, "If a clone is made, 
docs that clone owe something to the 
original''" 

Kontnick said if scientists can 
develop a way to clone specific 
organs or arteries, the benefits would 
be unimaginable

were no sufficient reasons 10 clone a 
human and Lhal cloning provides an oppor- 
tunity to establish a framework for 
extreme human experiments. 

"Replication of a human by cloning 
would radically alter the very definition of 
a human being by producing the world's 
first human with a single genetic parent," 
Annas told a senate committee in March. 
Annas emphasized that 
the cloning judgment should 
not be left up to the free 
market. 

"The market has no 

morality, and if we believe 

important values including 

issues of human rights and 

human dignity are at 

stake, we cannot leave 

cloning decisions to 

(be market," Annas 

said. 

"Only govern- 
ment has the author- 
ity to r 
ence and technol- 
ogy until its 
social and 
moral implica- 
tions are adc- 
q u a t c 1 y 
examined." 
be added. 
Caird 




Rexroad. Jr.. 
research leader for 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture, spoke 
to the House of Representatives subcom- 
mittee on technology about the wide bene- 
fits of animal cloning. 

"Cloning of animals from adult or fetal 
cells is seen by the agriculture department 
to be primarily a tool for research that 
could lead to important advances in 
biolechnol- 



clear that one of the main impetuses to 
nuclear transfer is coming from the agri- 
cultural industry, and that is where Ihe 
impact is going to be fell most." 

POUTICAL RAMIFICATIONS 

Clinton has banned the use of federal 
funds to support research on human 
cloning for five years in accordance with 
the recommendation of the NBAC. He has 
denied that any federal funds are currently 
being used for human cloning research. 

"I am urging the entire scientific and 
medical community, every foundation, 
every university, every industry lhai sup- 
ports work in this area to beed the federal 
government's example I'm asking for a 
voluntary moratorium on the cloning of 
human beings until our Bioethics Advisory 
Commission and our enure narinu have 
had a real cbance Go understand and debate 
the profound ethical impficancms of ibe 
latest advances." Clinton said. 

"By urging a moratorium on all private 
research in this area, we can ensure thai a.- 
we move forward on this issue,- we weigh 
ihe concerns of failh and family and phi- 
losophy and values, not merely of science 
alone," be added. 

Human consequences 

By opening the Pandora's box of 
cloning we entered a new era. We have 
enicrcd the "Brave New World" where 
past science fiction bas become reality 
The unthinkable has become physical 
Some questions to consider are whether 
Clinton's five year ban will put us five

There are no concreie answers lo 
every question, but this new technology 
has changed the world we live in. It may 
be hard to notice now. but the ripples in the 
genetic pool of life are still reaching the 
shore.

questions of just creating a duplicate copy

memories can be duplicated into the clone.

Life is like a roller coaster 



Pages 



Janet's Planet 



i 



summers ago, I 
went lo Cedar 



Point 



nh 



three friends I 
was open 10 
the idea or gel- 
ling on some 
roller coasters. 
but [ bad one 
reservation. 

"I'm not getting on ibe Demon 

Drop," I insisted. 

The Demon Drop is basically a 

cage that takes you and your crazy 

cohorts about a thousand feet 

up in the air and then drops 

you like a hot potato. 
My friends did 

drag me into the 

line for this ride 

and I watched, 

gulping, a 

other people 

screamed, ii 

seemed 10 

their 

speedy 

deaths 

Then ii 

was our 

turn Well. 

amazing- 
ly. I loved 

it and all 

the ndes we 

rode thai 

day That was 

ibe day 

became a 

Coaster Maniac 
Every year I 

10 the amusemei 

park and unleash my 12 

year-old self, from the 

parks opening until the 

end, when the brighdy lit rides 

finally close for the day. I only lake 



friends who feel the same passion I 
do for roller coaslcrs I even ask 
beforehand if tbey mind running 
down the ramp after each ride 
Someone who knows lb at you musi 
sii in the front seat on the Raptor is 
a good coaster buddy, indeed. 

Lasi summer, while 1 looked 
below onto [he ant people from (he 
crest of my beloved Magnum 
(which, immediately afier that 
moment, plunges downward ai 75 
miles per hour) I cam lo the 



Gumpian realization thai "Life is 
Like an Amusement Park." Some 
people come in, sil on ihe benches 
and watch other people. Some peo- 
ple are loo bogged down with stuff 
to really lei loose and have fun. 
Some are afraid; some think the fun 
is just for the kids. And some of us 
go for (he gusio. 

Elements of Ihe ride also have 
parallels in life. There is lhai 
.moment when the bar comes across 
your lap and you think, "Well, now 
I am committed to doing this. I can't 
get off now" There is the rush 
when you reach the top of ihe 
first hill and transform from a 
bundle of potential energy 
to a soaring creature. 
You go with the flow 
of the motion, and 
feel great when 
you yell and pul 
your hands in 
the air. 




ng 
faced (his ride. 
you become 
more courageous 
for (he next chal- 
lenge. As for me, I 
plan to keep going 
I bear 
there's a new one this 
year. 



Healing heard around the world 



by Janet Tobey 
Guest Whiter 

If you have seen ihe film 
Awakenings, you have already seen 
a bit of music iherapy in action Dr. 
Sacks discovers a creative solution 
to encourage the catatonic, elderly 
patients to feed themselves: he plays 
big band music during mealtime 
The music revives the patients and 
sparks them into action. 

Music therapy is a growing 
field, gaining momentum and recog- 
nition among mainstream health 
care professionals. In our communi- 
ty, there is a growing awareness of 
music therapy because of IPFW's 
degree program It is similar lo 
occupational therapy and physical 
therapy It consists of using music to 
address physical, cognitive and 
social functioning 

Music therapists work wilh peo- 
ple with special needs such as (hose 
wilh developmental disabilities, 
autism, attention deficit disorder, 
Alzheimer's and speech delays. 
Music therapy is applied in specific 
populations, such as nursing homes, 
pre schools and prisons. 

"Music is the tool we use to 
bring about rapport," said Katrina 
Boedeker, Assistant Professor of 
Music, who teaches music iherapy 
coursework Boedeker discusses 
with her students the five ways in 
which music is used therapeutically: 
•As (he carrier of information, per- 
haps through song lyrics. 
•As a reinforcer for participating in 
(he group or completing goals. 
•As sUDCQire Rhythm can be used 
to promote the releaming of moior 
skills. 

•As learning material and stimu- 
lus. Learning the ABCs from song 
is an example of (his use for 
music 

•As a reflection of processes to be 
learned The lyrics of a song may 
open our insight abou( a particular 
issue. It may gel us to think wbai it 
means lo us personally. 

Music Iherapy may be used in 
a psychiatric setting to bring about 
changes in behavior among tbose 
who are dealing with problems such 
as depression, low self-esteem, 
anger or substance abuse. A good 
music therapist in a psychiatric set- 
ting must not only be a good musi- 
cian but also must be an excellent 
therapist, in order lo help the 
patients process what they learn 
about themselves in the sessions. 

Charter Beacon music therapist 
Caiby Rumschlag uses song sharing, 
group activities and guided imagery 
in music to help her patients deal 
with problems and learn to discuss 
them. 



When her Self -nurturing group 
gathers, she begins with a song, such 
as Lay Down Your Burden Then. 
gently guided by her soft words and 
the interplay of music, each of (he 
group's members mentally takes his 
or her own journey Rumschlag 
guides the patients to imagine them- 
selves placing their burdens in a 
backpack and carrying them lo ihe 
edge of a chasm, where they loss Ihe 
package into the depth 

Afier several minutes, when the 
journey is completed, Rumschlag 
inviies (he members of the (herapy 
group (o share what (hey experi- 
enced and bow tbey fell along ihe 
way The music seems to have 
allowed the patients to reach buried 
emotions; many patients shed tears, 
yel discuss feelings of relief and 
optimism 

"For many of the people, il is ihe 
first time ihey have been able to 
relax naturally in a long timet" said 
Rumschlag. 

Because music therapy is a pow- 
erful and non-threatening medium, 
unique outcomes are possible 
Clinical experiences have shown 
thai ii can even help 
those who are resistive lo 
other treatment 
approaches, such as 
those with Alzheimer's 



disease. Exposure lo music has been 
shown lo produce definite bio-phys- 
iological effecis. including boosting 
the immune system. 

"One issue (hat music therapists 
often must wrestle wilh is thai a lot 
of people think we just play music to 
make people feel better, and it's real- 
ly not about that." said Boedeker. 
"Scientific reseaich shows thai 
music affecis thought and behavior 
We are using ii as a lool for change.'' 

In Fort Wayne, approximately 
12 agencies employ music thera- 
pists Reform in the health care sys- 
tem has led to the increase in music 
therapy positions in traditional 
health care facilities, such as gener- 
al hospitals, hospice and wellness 
programs. 

The IPFW Music Therapy pro- 
gram is one of (he nation's few 
music therapy training programs. It 
combines strong musical naming 
and broad studies in the liberal arts 
wilh an emphasis on practical clini- 
cal experiences. Graduates of the 4- 
year decree oroeram are skilled in 
many aspects, in order to bring 
music and healing (o (he world.

Nine yean ago. Robert Jeske, 
associate professor in sociology and 
anthropology, surveyed the north- 
east side of campus He had a tip 
from a local collector who bad 
shown him some projectile points 
the collector had found between 
Gates Sports Center and Canterbury 
Green Apartments. 

Jeske knew that the site had 
possibilities for interesting anthro- 
pological discoveries because of its 
proximity to the St. Joseph river and 
two creeks that travel through the 
campus. 

Beginning in 1989, Jeske and 
his field school began to conduct 
shovel tests to collect materials 
from the whole ridge. 
The sand dune bore 
signs from prehistoric 
inhabitants from 
16,000 years ago 

Jeske said the site 
was probably a small 
camp where early 
inhabitants special- 
ized their stone tools 
by flaking off pieces 
of the stone He said 
many flakes have 
been found during the 
dozen or so digs the 
field school has con- 
ducted. 

The field school 
program is designed 
to give a complete 
experience during an 
anthropological dig 
Students begin by sur- 
veying the land and 
conducting a back- 
ground investigation 
of the site Next they 
test the soil to find the 
best starling point and 
then start the dig 
From the beginning of 
the survey to the end 
of the dig, the students 



keep journals and make a final 
report about the whole dig. 

"This makes them a more 
rounded individual They've learned 
something, but they also get applied 
experience." Jeske said. 

The practical experience has 
helped many former students of the 
field school get jobs. Jeske said thai 
even though most professional 
arcbeologist do not know where 
Fort Wayne is, they know of IPFW 
and the quality of its students. 

"Out students are doing a nice 
job of selling IPFW and I'm proud 
of that. It's the measure of a quality 
program, not just that they get hired, 
but they do very well afterwards. I 
get rave reviews. Employers call me 
and ask for more students." Jeske 
said.
