Worlhley and Bonsib said the com-

across Ihe country, 

"Money will also be needed to in-

Joseph Guisti, chancellor of IPFW,

The investigation of a high-tech

Fanlus Company of Chicago, which

Worlhley said he agrees with this

"High technology is the wave of Ihe

Correction in design flaw 
to bring heat to buildings 



By MATTHEW IIEN'RY 
Staff Writer 
Shivering in Ihc corridors of Ihe 
Qassroom and Music Building will be 
a thing of the pa st said Jolin Camaghi . 
vice diancelior for Tinanciai affairs 
Thai is. ileverjihing goes according lo 
schedule The Classroom and Music 
Building (CMi and the AlhleUc 
Building, both plagued by healing 
prbblcms last winter t&gt;ecause of a 
minor design fiaw, are scheduled to 
have the healing systems upgraded 
and functioning properly before the 
snow files again this year 

The buildings were designed by 
Scbenkle and Shulli, Inc., In 
assodallon with the Waller Sholcr 
Construction Co , who designed all 
previoiEly built IPFW buildings. The 
buildings were designed with energy 
efficiency in mind, C^rnaghi said, and 
Sctienkie and Shulti calculated what 11 
would take to heal each building. In 
Iheir calculations, Shenkle and Shulti 
considered three main factors: 

— Radiant heal generated from 
small electric heating units iocaled in 
the [acuity and staff of Hces, 

— diffused heat generated from the 
ballasts of the 40 watt [lourescent 
lamps used for lighUng, 

— iMdy heal generated from 
students, faculty and stalf who occupy 
Uie buildings. 

The buildings were conslnicled by 
Hagerman Conslrucllon Corp. and 
completed in November, 1991. Faculty 
and staff moved In shortly thereafler 
and students began attending classes 
two months laler wilh the start of the 
new semester. 

The buildings were noticeably cool 
from Ihc starl, Carnaghi said, bul no 
one took II seriously Figuring it may 
take a while lor buildings oflhal size lo 
reach and maintain a comfortable 
lemperalure Also, the bodies of 



have to break these things in." 

U wasn't long into the new year. 
however, when Ihe university realised 
It had serious heating problems in lis 
twonewbuildings 

"We couldn't keep up wilh the cold." 
said Donald Kaltcr, director of the 
Physical Plant. "The real back.

used to keep his reeds (part of Ihe 
mouth piece for wDodwind in-

Dorolhy Whitney and Sally Duncan, 
both music department secretaries, 
share an office on the ground floor of 
the CM building Tliey said Ihal they 
loo e?&lt;pericnced similar incidents 
because of the bluer cold 

"We wore long Johns, slocking caps,

said "The plants didn't gel along well

Bolh women said they felt the 
university did what it could lo keep the 
offices warm. They said the physical

put plastic over the windows lo cul

"It didn't fix 11." Duncan said, "bul 

The lenanls began qjestioning Ihc

Whilney agreed. She said il was her 
understanding the body heat 
generated from Ihe classrooms and 
offices above would be redirected lo 
Ihc ground level. 

"II (body heall was supposed to gel

Duncan said even if the body heal 
did get channelled to Ihe lower level it 
would immediately be cooled by dra lis

After an indepth study, the com-

The question of whowas responsible 
(or the design flaw rested between Uw 
archllecls — Waller Sholer Con- 
slrucllon and Schenkle and Shull2. Inc 
11 was decided that Schenkle and 
Shulti, who did the healing 
calculations and specified the slie of 
the units, would be responsible (or 
correcting the problem, 

Wes Welsh, architect for Schenkle 
and Shullz, said his company Is at- 
tempting to resolve the healing 
prolilem wilh their llablllly Insurance 
company. Conilnenial Assurance 
CompanyiCNA). 

"We arc trying 10 resolve il," Welsh 
said. "We are not quilethercbut we're 
doing everything we can." 

Olher factors that "played a role" In 
the heating problems, Welsh said, was 
incomplete conilruclion which 
resulted in drafls, and the moving o( 
furnilure into the buildings allowing 
warm air lo escape. He said, however, 
everyone involved with the situation

Crooked Lake biology lab provides research facility, classroom 



Many residents of the Fort Wayne

Dr. Kenneth Brown is Ihe director 
ollhestation "Ttie station is part o( 
Ihe Indiana Univcrsily tradition of 
studying lakes and streams." he 



The current sUlion al Crooked 
Lake was built in 196) with Ihe help 
of Ihe National Science Foundation. 
It includes a I.OOO square foot 
analytical latnratory-ciassroom, a 
targe boalhouse wilh several 
aluminum boals. molorsanda large 
pontoon boat. Also mciuded in Ihe 
facility are five trailers wtiich

who work at the station during the 



directly adjacent lo a stale nature 
preserve that comprises ap- 
proximately IQO acres. Both the 
slation grounds and the nature 
preserve arc wooded and well 
isolatedfrom other, more developed 
areas of the lake. As Dr. brown pul 
it: "The whole lake is a nice en- 
lironmenl. among the deanest in 
Indiana." 



HTlnlly in 









Bart&gt;er also staled that Cnxiked 
Lake is among "the mosi 
Ollgotroptlie lakes in Indiana." 
What Uiis means is thai Ihe lake is 
deeper, colder and clearer than

polluUnts enter the water. This 
special cbaraderistic of Crooked 
L^ke makes 11 interesting to 
researchers slud&gt;ing the elfecls of 
agricultural drainage into lakes. 

Currenlly, the researchers 
working at the slalion are using 
J9l,0(» worth of grants [rofided by 
IheNationaiSdence Foundation. 

"I am involved wilh the sludy ol 
snail life cycles, to determine how 
organisms adapt lo uncertain en- 
vironments " He explained that his 
work looks into the natural selection 
[Toctss and the snad. Other 
research is being done by Dr. Allan 
Konopka of Purdue W. Lafayette, 
who ts stuilylng Ihe physldogical 



ecology of algae in the lake,

the growih of algae in the natural 
environment Scientists from other 
universUles use the facilities as 
well, with some coming from as far 
away as California and Tennessee 
One thing Brown said was very nice 
about the station was the fact that 
due ID the size of IPFW, the staUon 
provides an opportunity to involve 
undergraduate students in actual 
Field research. 

Theslallon is slocked with a Lirge 
amount of scientific equipment, 
including a speclropholometer. high 
speed centrifuge. pH meters, 
dissolved oiygoi and condudivity 
meters, drying oiens. furnaces, 
autoclaves, microscopes, balances 
and a sophislicalcd device for

When Inlemalional Harvester an- 
nounced il woulil pull out oT Fori Wayne 
lasl week, cconomtsts predicted (he 
cily's unemployment rale to rise from 
Ihe presenl 12 percent to ZOpercenl. 

Tough limes indeed may be in store for 
the cily, but many forget Fori Wayne is 
now rid of 3 struggling, failing company 
that la expected to lose tl.5 billion In the 
fiscal year ending Oct 31. 

Springfield can have Harvester. 

Now thai tH will be leaving, Fort 
Wayne can look for better sources of 
employment, and IPFW can help. 

Chancellor Guisli has already offered 
Mayor Moses the university's help to 
bring high technology industries to the 
cily, and a university leader is working

Ju9l as sandbaggcrs look Immediate 
action (o slop flood swollen rivers. The 
Greater Fort Wayne Chamber of 
Commerce has made a wise choice to 
follow the Fanlus Company's suggestion 
(o pursue a high- technology center 
which could lead to the expansion and 
attraction o( high-tech firms In nor- 



theastern Indiana. 

With 24 high-tech firms already In the 
city and four inslitullons (IPFW. IVY 
Tech, Indiana Institute of Technology. 
Trl Slate) providing educational 
resources, northeastern Indiana has the 
potential to be prosperous again. 

Working to build a high-tech center is 
a wise and practicaldecision, 

Warren Worlhley, chairperson of the 
manufacturing technology department, 
said, "High technology is the wave of Ihe 
future. If a company doesn't add high 
technology techniques, it won't be 
competitive." 

Gene Robinson, vice president of 
research and development at 
MagnavoK, said. "I think ills possible to 
reach the point where there are instead 
of perhaps 7,000 high-leeh employees in 
the area as we have now, there could be 
30.000 in 10 orisyears. 

High technology could help lo provide 
economic recovery for Fort Wayne and 
thocity should take advantage of it.
