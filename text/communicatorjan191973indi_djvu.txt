COMM 




Volume III, Issue 11 i^ 



Indiana- Purdue University at Fort Wayne 



January 19, 1973 



^Domes at Sea' is regional winner 



by Dan Kelley 

In mid-December 1972 
Mr. Audley Grossman, Re- 
gional Director of the Am- 
erican College Theatre 
Festival, notified Dr. O. 
Franklin Ken worthy, 

chairman ofthedepanmenc 
of theatre at Purdue Uni- 
versity at Ft. Wayne, that 
Purdue Indiana Theatre's 
Dames at Sea had been se- 
lected by the ACTF as 
one of six best collegiate 
theatre productions in the 
Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana 
area and invited him to 
bring Dames to the Ameri- 
can College Theatre Re- 
gional Festival to be held 
In Indianapolis on January 
4,5,6, 1973. This honor 
necessitated a major effort 
on the part of the theatre 
department tore-assemble 
and modify the set so that 
it would work In a different 
theatre and to relocate and 
organize the costumes and 
properties. Also, all the 
props, set and costumes to 
be prepared for touring and 
loaded Into a truck and 
tranported to Indianapolis. 

Larry Life, director 



and one of the six actors 
In the cast which lovingly 
spoofs the extravagant mo- 
vies of the 1930's, had to 
work his cast hard over va- 
cation to re-rehearse the 
singing, dancing and acting 
and quickly bring back a 
highly polished standard of 
excellence which was the 
trademark of Dames. Mr. 
Life has had experience In 
preparing for regional fes- 
tivals having won the Tex- 
as, Arkansas, Lousiana 
regional Festival with his 
production of Luther while 
teaching at Texas A&amp;I in 
1970. 

But all the effort that went 
Into preparing Dames for 
Indianapolis was weel re- 
warded whenabrlllant per- 
formance not only won ac- 
claim as the bestatthe fes- 
tival but also won unani- 
mous recommendation by 
the Regional ACTF Comm- 
ittee to go to Washing- 
ton D.C. and participate In 
the American College Na- 
tional Theatre Festival, 
presented by the American 
Theatre Association and 



Tuition liilce 
may be in store 



The Student'sGovernmenc 
of I-PU at Fort Wayne an- 
nounced Monday that an in- 
crease In tuition may be the 
result of budget decreases 
recommended by the State 
Budget Agency. 

Larry Strong, Chairman 
of the Education Study Com- 
mittee, said that regional 
campuses may be forced to 
increase tuition in orderto 
maintain themselves and 
the quality education they 
offer if our legislature does 
not do something about the 
frightening recommenda- 
tions of the State Budget 
Agency. 

"An increase in tuition 
by one-third took place In 
1969, and would probably 
increase by that much If 
not more within the next 
year. This would raise the 
fee per semester hour to 
approximately $27.00. Tak- 
ing the average load of 30 
credit hours a year and 
multiplying It by twenty 
seven, then adding parking 
and activity fees, you come 
up with a figure around 
$900.00 a year as com- 
pared to $690.00, forthat 
same load presently. That 



figure could go as high as 
$1,000 a year for the stu- 
dent who carries a heavy 
load with lab fees included. 
The out-of-state student 
could pay as much as 
$1,750," Strong said. 

"The reason regional 
campuses have been sucha 
success Is because of the 
low-cost, quality education 
they have provided for per- 
sons who were married, 
working, or simply couldn't 
afford to pay $2400.00 to go 
to school. I cannot com- 
prehend why the State Bud- 
get Agency wants to place 
additional Inirdens o n 
these people,"' he added. 

Brock Able, student body 
president, once again ask- 
ed citizens to write their 
legislators concerning the 
budget decreases. Able 
suggested thatcltlzensalso 
write to Rep, John Hart, 
chairman of the House Ways 
and Means Committee, 5141 
N, Meridian St., Indiana- 
polis, Ind. and Governor 
Otis Bowan, Capital Build- 
ing, Indianapolis, Ind. 

"We, in theStudent'sGov- 
ernment, are doing all we 
can ta .fight these budget 



the Smithsonian Institution 
at the John F. Kennedy Cen- 
ter for the Performing Arts 
and sponsored by American 
Airlines and Standard 
Oil Division of Amoco. 

Winning the festival 
brings national recognition 
to PIT and Indiana-Purdue 
University at Ft. Wayne as 
one of the 30 best college 
theatres in the United 
States. With the high re- 
commendation of the Re- 
gional Committee and the 
strong favorable reaction 
that audiences have had who 
have seen the production, 
there Is a strong possibil- 
ity that Dames will be in- 
vited to Washington D.C. 
to participate in the Na- 
tional Festival thereby 
gaining the recognition of 
being one of the ten best 
collegiate theatres In the 
United States. 

Another high honor that 
PIT has won Is the select- 
ion of PIT, in co-operation 
with the Fort Wayne Fine ]f 
Arts Center, as the spon- 
sor of the 1974 Regional 

Festival. 

decreases. We want this 
campus to grow for the 
citizens of this area, and if 
the Administration, faculty, 
and student body continue 
their present support, we 
have a good chance of 

winning. However, citizen 
support will make our ef- 
forts that much more ef- 
fective," he aid.

I-PU COMMUNICATOR 



January 19, 1973 



To The Editor 



Dear Editor: 

I warn to comment on the 
statement by Carl Schweppe 
on the editorial page of the 
December 8 Communica- 
tor. I disagree with Carl 
that the American popula- 
tion has got to be the lazi- 
est In the world. In fact, 
I believe that contrary to 
Carl's statement the A- 
merican people are the 
liardest workers in the 
world. This is especially 
true of the workingclass. 
They have less time for 
true leisure, lees time for 
contemplation and cultur- 
al activities, less time to 
really enjoy the beauties of 
Nature, less time for true 
arts and crafts and family 
life than any other people 
in the modern or develop- 
ing world. 

The problem is a com- 
bination of a few things. 
One, the Juda-Christian 
concept, that hard work is 
somehow vlrtlous and leads 
to a path of heavenly re- 
wards while not to work 
hard Is somehow sinful. 
This theory is pretty much 
supported by Ford, General 
Motors, General Electric 
amd for very obvious rea- 
sons, more profits, and by 
the church which works 
hand in hand with these cor- 
porations resulting in the 
total exploitation of man by 
programming him inco an 
even faster work race, al- 
ways thinking that if he 
could only achieve a little 
more speed he would be 
like the dog at the race 
track chasing the mechani- 
cal rabbit, catch it, and his 
wante would be satisfied, 
not realizing that the fast- 
er he runs the faster hts 
elusive rabbit speeds up. 

In this programmed race 
to buy every more labor 
saving gadgets, the worker 
and his wife, or at least 
he, has to hold down two 
jobs just to keep up pay- 
ments on these gadgets, 
including the car which he 
needs to race from work 
home for a quick lunch, 
race to the bowling alley 
or golf course and then 
race home for a few hours 
sleep to repeat the same 
performance the next day, 
creating more jobs and 
moonlighting opportunities 
for more people like him- 
self and most Important 
more profits for corpora- 
tions, enabling them to use 
this surplus capital to buy 
up, exploit, and to a great 
extent destory the natural 
resources of our country 
and with the surplus cap- 
ital to move into other 
countries where the natur- 
al resources and workers 
can be even more ef- 
fectively exploited. Ifthle 
cannot be achieved by 
peaceful capital Invest- 
ment, they can do it by 
war as in Viet Nam. 

So wtiat is the answer. 
Is there one? Yes there 
is, and It is becoming more 
obvious every day. The 
answer is to see and under- 
stand what has been 



achieved in the Soviet 
Union — that is spite of two 
devestatlng wars under 
socialism, it has brought 
the most backward, uned- 
ucated nation to very near 
the level of the USA and 
other western nations. 
Where although they don't 
have the affluent people 
we have, neither do they 
have abject poverty and 
hopelessness that exists in 
this country. All people 
share in the economic pro- 
gress of the country and 
the fruits of their labor. 
This same progress i s 
being achieved In China, 
where only a couple of de- 
cades ago millions of peo- 
ple starved every year 
under the futile capitalist 
system while a few very 
wealthy families siphoned 
the fruits of their laborand 
resources of their country 
In sales and Investments a- 
broad and diverted hun- 
dreds of millions to their 
personal bank accounts. 

Yes, even Cuba, In spite 
of the fact that America 
has done everything it could 
short of a military attack 
to destory it, has been able 
to substantially improve 
the standard of living ofall 
its people, build hundreds 
of schools not only for Its 
children but also to educate 
its adults who never had a 
chance to go to school 
under the old free enter- 
prise system, controlled by 
a dictator and outside cap- 
ital. 

Yes, there is an answer, 
Carl, and It behoves you and 
your fellow students at lU/ 
PU to state looking in this 
direction and learn what 
socialism is all about. That 
is the path of the future. 
Look into it. 

Name Withheld 
By Request 

Dear Editor: 

As the controversy over 
the Higher Education Com- 
mission's recommenda- 
tions slowly fades into non- 
existence, another, and 
more important threat to 
secondary education on the 
regional campus level has 
arisen. 

The State Budget A- 
gency along with the Com- 
mission on Higher Educa- 
tion, recommends a bud- 
get for all state support- 
ed schools in Indiana. Of 
course, regional campuses 
are included. From this 
State Budget Agency some 
startling figures were con- 
ceived. Indiana University 
Regional Campuses re- 
quested a 37.1 mllUondol- 
lar budget for 1973-1975. 
This figure is for alllnd- 
iana regional campuses In 
Indiana. The State Budget 
Agency recommended a 
19.7 million dollar budget 
for those same years, or 
a difference of about 18 
million dollars. 

For Purdue Regional 
Campuses, the outlook was . 



not much better. The re- 
quested budget for Purdue 
Regional Campuses was 
23.3 million dollars for 
1973-1975. The State Bud- 
get Agencies recommenda- 
tion was 17.8 million, or a 
difference of about 6 mil- 
lion dollars. Totaling these 
figures, we can clearly 
see that Indiana and Purdue 
regional campuses are the 
victims of a 24 million dol- 
lar rip-off. To top it all 
off, the Agency expects 
these regional campuses to 
operate on less money in 
1973-74 then they did in 
1971-1972. This Is a model 
example of negative growth. 

I understand the Agencle's 
efforts to save money, but 
I ask them to Justify the 
budget increases at Ind- 
iana State University when 
their enrollment decreased 
by almost 500 students in 
1972. 

I am also aware that the 
present tax structure of 
Indiana posesaproblemfor 
post-secondary education. 
The pie has probably gotten 
smaller, but what's more 
Important Is how big you 
cut the pieces. In other 
words, you can still have 
a empire In Bloomington 
and Lafayette without de- 
stroying the regional 
campuses that have pro- 
vided thousands the edu- 
cation they could not afford 
elsewhere. 

So, as a student, and as a 
citizen, I challenge the leg- 
islature to do all they can 
for the continuance of re- 
gional campuse education. 
I also encourage students 
to write to their legisla- 
tors concerning this great 

threat. If the Agencle's 
recommendations go 
through the State House un- 
touched, tuition will have to 
Increase at the regional 
campus level, and this is 
defeating the purpose of the 

regional campus system.

From the President's desk 



by Brock Able 



Now, that the first semes- 
ter is over I think the Stu- 
dents' Government should 
thank certain organizations 
for their help with our pro- 
jects. 

First, I want to thank the 
Geology Club, Circle K, and 
the APO Fraternity for 
their help In the moving of 
the library. For the first 
time since I have been go- 
ing to Indiana-Purdue Uni- 
versity, everyone seemed 
to come together for the 
common good of the c a m- 
pus. Besides the separate 
organizations many Indivi- 
duals got behind the pro- 
ject. We saw administra- 
tors actually running 
books, people who do not 
attend school carrying 
books, and a couple of char- 
acters who wanted to see 
whose arches would fall 
first carrying books. Yes, 
the library was moved. 

We put out a Student Di- 
rectory with the help of the 
Kappa Delta Thetas and Be- 
ta Phi Gammas. Believe 
me, they put forth a real 
effort for the good of all 
students. When we passed 
out the Directories the Del- 
ta, Gammas helped a great 



deal. 

I think that the Students' 
Union Board should be 
commended for the number 
of dances that we have had 
this past semester. For a 
group of people who are In- 
experienced the Union 
Board has been trying to do 
a good job. I can only hope 
that the Board does just as 
weU this semester. Also, I 
think the Penny Carnival 
was a success and [want to 
extend a thank you to all 
organizations who partici- 
pated. Next year we really 
hope to have a very large 
carnival. 

Our main project yet this 
semester is to go ahead and 
work on the Budget request 
for the regional campuses. 
We in the Students' Gov- 
ernment want our campus 
and not Just a two year 
stop-off for the main cam- 
pus. 
Now, a pledge from me. I 
have been trying to get out 
with students and find out 
what is wanted and needed. 
Our probelms can only be 
solved through better com- 
munication, so when you 
see me let me know what's 
on vour mind.

Sendalc issues alert 



Theodore L. Sendak today 
warned Hoosler consumers 
to be on the alert for fly- 
by-nights posing as furnace 
repairmen. He stated that 
with the coming of the most 
severe months of winter, 
consumers may be ap- 
proached by persons seek- 
ing to collect money for 
services not performed, or 
for services which are not 
necessary. 

Sendak stated that often a 
deceptive scheme begins 
when a so-called "furnace 
man", who is not called to 



the home, knocks on the 
door and offers to clean 
the furnace free, or for a 
nominal fee. Once he gets 
to the heating plant, he may 
claim that he discovers 
flues with holes, burned or 
cracked pots, or that dead- 
ly fumes are escaping and 
an entire furnace must be 
Installed Immediately. Un- 
less the consumer obtains 
another opinion from the 
local building Inspector or 
another regulat furnace re- 
pairman, he may be de- 
ceived.

The Fort Wayne Folk 
School, a non-profit, tax- 
exempt, non -accredited 
community school open to 
anyone, has been awarded 
a $2000 grant from the Ind- 
iana Committee for the Hu- 
manities for the operation 
of the Folk School's "The- 
atre for Ideas," Terry Do- 
ran, Director of the Folk 
School, will be the series 
moderator and In charge 
of organizing and program- 
ing. 

What is the Theatre forl- 
deas?: It is a community 
discussion program. In an 
age of insecurity, confu- 
sion, and Impotence, In an 
age threatened to be over- 
come by the tyranny of the 
specialist, in such an age 
there should be and there 
must be a forum where all 
social, classes can meet and 
talk. Such a forum Is the 
aim of the "Theatre for I- 
deas," which is not intend- 
ed then to be a platform for 
the padding of egos nor is It 
to be an arena filled with 
bombaslty and hot air. Ra- 
ther It Is to be a crisp, live- 
ly dialogue between 
speaker and audience. The 
speaker will come not as 
an "authority" but some- 
one with some particular 



experience on how to look 
at the world and understand 
It. Members of theaudlence 
will come with an open and 
searching mind and a feel- 
ing that his or her willing- 
ness CO listen as well as to 
contribute questions and 
comments makes him or 
her a unique member of a 
group of learners. 

Therfore speaker and au- 
dience work toward a com- 
mon objective -namely, the 
establishing of a language 
of experience that will ex- 
tend the visions of all con- 
cerned. Hopefully, such a 
vision will create a climate 
that joins ethics to reality 
and reconciles political at- 
titudes with human respon- 
ses. 

When and where?: The 
series will begin Friday, 
January 26, 8:00 p.m., at 
the First Wayne Street 
Methodist Church, 910 
Broadway, with a Commun- 
ity Festival featuring re- 
freshments, entertainment, 
and a discussion by all 
gruops In the area (and In- 
terested Individuals) on how 
we can work together and 
provide Input and Ideas for 
future "Theatre for Ideas, " 
which win meet at the same 
place and time every Fri- 



day thereafter through the 
end of April. 

Sample topics forthe ser- 
ies Include Rellglonandthe 
Occult, Education, Comm- 
unications, The Quality of 
Life, America, 1973, The 
Arts, and others. We wel- 
come ideas and panlcl- 
padon from all concerned 
people. Speakers will In- 
clude professors from all 
city colleges (as stipulated 
by the gant) in addition to 
all kinds of people from the 
community. The series Is 
free and open to the public. 
If you want to be challenged, 
stimulated, and enlight- 
ened, "Theatre for Ideas" 
is the place to be.

A COMMENTARY 



by Stan Jones 



Mid-season 



with our inyolvemenc In Vietnam greatly diminished 
and Its end close at hand, I would like to reflect on one 
aspect which has been with us from the beginning. The 
"Peace" movement, having its origins in the -Ban the 
Bomb- movement of the 1950's will undoubtedly be as 
much a point of discussion, criticism andanalyslsafter 
our involvement has ended as It has been during the 
Vietnam experience. It is not my desire to discuss the 
entire scope of the "Peace" movement, but merely to 
expose some unnicetles about Its more visual aspects. 

To say the least, the "Peace" movement hasbeen fla- 
grantly hypocritical. The charlatanism most eminant 
comes from those movement leaders who operate on a 
nationwide basis. Not only nationally, but locally we find 
peaceniks who can not escape the temptation to deal In 
distortion and fraud. Do those individuals .In the move- 
ment who set policy actually expect us to overlook their 
sanctimonius acts? 

Professing a seemingly endless love of humanity and a 
non-violent pacifistic approach to living, the "Peace" 
movement has warmly embraced the North Vietnamese 
with both arms. Claiming that rhe North Vietnamese are 
the unfortunate victims of aggressive American Imper- 
ialism, we daily hear them render barrage after barrage 
of Anti-American, Pro-North Vietnamese propaganda. 

Why so much concern for the North Vietnamese— as if 
they had done nothingtobrlngthe war to their own door- 
steps. From the accounts of Clark, Hayden et. al. It 
would seem that the North was merely minding its own 
business when all of a sudden it started raining bombs. 
Are the peaceniks walking around like horses with blind- 
ers? If their profession of love for their fellow man is 
sincere, should they not also be concerned with the Lao- 
tians, Cambodians, and South Vietnamese who have been 
wounded or made homeless overthepasttwodecades by 
communist agression? 

When the North Vietnamese launched their latest attack 
across the DMZ crushing all civilians they encountered, 
did we hear the peaceniks cry with alarm over this ob- 
vious escolatlon? This invasion the North Vietnamese 
executed was the largest such tank and heavy material 
Invasion since World war II, but yet not even a whim- 
per of protest. 

Where were the peaceniks when the mass graves in 
Hue were uncovered after the 1968 Tet Offensive. Over 
3,000 South Vietnamese were murdered and placed in 
shallow graves by the retreating North Vietnamese 
army. Over 3,0001 Sort of makes Lt. Galley look like a 
bumbling amateur. There was no public outcry from the 
movement over this incident; no mention of the fact 
that the communist North was actually killing people in 
Che South, This lack of humanitarian concern amazes 
me. 

The "Peace" movement, admittedly, hasconfusedme. 
Not only do I not understand their actions, I also fall to 
understand their motives. Dotheyconslderthe North our 
friends and think we should be fighting the South in- 
stead, or, do they Just consider people who live else- 
where In Southest Asia to be less than human and not 
wonhy of their consideration? How can they profess a 
love for mankind and not attempt to limit the actions of 
the North? Their doesn't seem to be much consistency In 
their morality. 

Tomorrow we have yet another chance to view them 
In action. If all goes according to plan we will again be 
assailed for our alleged atrocities in Vietnam with, as 
their advertisements read, no mention of communist 
aggression. In their Caravan Against Death tomorrow 
I liope they have the decency to mourn for those thou- 
sands and thousands of Innocent people who have been 
killed by the North. It's the least they can do. Maybe 
It's expecting too much of them though. I doubt whether 
their past charlatanism can be redeemed by one after- 
nopn's melodrama., but it might be a start.

The season Is more than 
half over for the Indiana- 
Purdue Basketball Masto- 
dons of 1972-1973. The 
team is doing a lot of things 
right, but according to the 
record of 6 wins and 11 
losses, they haven't done 
enough. They are a good 
team, with an overabun- 
dance of talent, but for 
some reason the spirit is 
lacking. Perhaps the sem- 
ester break caused the 
players to devote their 
minds to other areas be- 
sides sports. If so, let's 
hope that they get it back 
together now that classes 
have started again. 

At the beginning of the 
season I wrote that the team 
couldn't make it without fan 
support. At the home games 
in Central's gym, no more 
than 50 people ever show 
up for a game. Even the 
cheerleaders seem to be 
copping out. I don't think 
that I've seen a game yet 
in which all seven cheer- 
leaders have been present. 

While I can criticize spir- 
it, I can't criticize skill. 
We have some real talent 
on our team and every game , 
Is very enjoyable to watch. 

Don Chaney is possibly the 
best basketball player In 
the history of our campus. 
He has some fantastic 
moves on offense and at the 
same time is always block- 
ing many shots on defense. 
Gary Trump can jump like 
a kangaroo and Is a good 
outside shooter and a great 
ball handler. Tom Bernlng 
Is just another one of those 
ball players who scores all 
the time but you really don't 
notice It until the game's 
over and you read It In the 
box score the next day in the 
paper. 

Anyone who attends the 
games knows what is wrong 
with the Mastodons, but 
there is still time to Im- 
prove their rather anemic 
record. 

Tennis film

"Tournament, ■" featuring

ing tennis players, will be
