All-university senate 

The proposal for a single, unified, all-university senate has been drawn up by the 
Task Force on University Governance and presented to the Ad Hoc Join Faculty 
Steering Committee (AHJFSO The Communicator endorses this proposal and 
strongly recommends its adoption by the faculty and the chancellor. 

Notions of an all-university senate have been on campus a long time. The old 
Parliament idea just about became reality three or four years ago. It wbb finally 
defeated because it would not replace the existing senates, merely serve as a 
coordinating body for them. 

The idea came up again last year with the announcement of the merger. The 
presidents called for a single governance mechanism for the two faculties on 
campus. The Task Force on University Governance began considering the 
possibility of merging all campus constituencies into a single body rather than just 
combining the I.U. and Purdue faculty senates. 

The all-university senate received an added boost from Chancellor Donald 
Schwartz. The chancellor told the task force that he preferred a single senate to a 
proliferation of governance bodies with which he would have to deal 

The concept of one body has picked up m&lt; 
endorsements from the Student Senate and 
groups have gone on record supporting the on 
each constituency. 

The Communicator lakes pride in joining 
advocating such a body. 

This leaves only the faculty I oendfirsc the Cdnffpl. There is significant faculty 
opposition to an all-university, but by the same token, the faculty does not appear 
ready to scuttle the concept. 

Ultimately, il will be the chancellor who will adopt or veto the plan. The 
Communicator urges Dr Schwartz to keep in mind the s! inlenl'. nm\ staff personnel 
when he makes that decision,

The intramural department is considering reserving the swimming pool and 
possibly the basketball court at the new Old Fort Y.M.C.A. The facilities would be 
rented for the next semester with hopes of using the pool for most of the semester. 

The program would be open to all activity card holders or those students with 
S15 fee receipts. This activity would not be a competitive program where you have 
1 but a fun, free activity for the students enjoyment. 

Swimming would be for one or two days a week. 

New Old Port Y.M.C.A. can let Indiana-Purdue reserve the pool in the 
afternoon from 12:00 noon to 2:00 p.m. or evenings from 9:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. For 
those students who are interested, please fill out the coupon below and return to the 
Student Activity office, room 225 in the Student Union.
