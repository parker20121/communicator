by Jennifer Skinner

When Mall Delong accepted the 
position of Sports Information Director 
in July, be didn'i expect tbe sports 
intensity he received, because "sports 
information director" wos not the only 
position Delong tackled when he 
moved into his 
new office. ?^

to see the inlcrns attending sporting 

As a part of Delong's marketing 
responsibilities, he bos lo raise the nec-

Students serving as interns would be 
able lo cam anywhere from one lo three

Staff Editorial 
All talk and no show 



We a( (he Communicator were 
prompted &lt;o write this week's edilorial 
on IPFW minority rccruiimenl prac- 
tices, (oi two basic reasons. Pint we 
on: students al IPFW, and therefore lire 
concerned about the manner in which 
our university is administrated. 
Second, we are concerned thai ai a

to evade questions dealing with minori-

that in the University Resources Policy 
(CommittBC, twenty-five year master

I minority students is not even a pari of 
the agenda. 

Our question: Why not? 



Docs the administration feel that 
minority students arc a waste of time 
and simply not important enough to 
put on the master plan. It is preposter- 
ous that no time is set aside lo include 
students that they supposedly are trying 

The message we're hearing from 
the administration is this: "If you're 
not while, we really don't care about 
you. but hey. thanks for the tuition," . 

Why is it that the administration 
relics on the few persons in 
Multicultural Services to do all the 
work? In doing so, they often will 
highlight the programs that make the 
^univenity look noble and dedicated to 
minority programs. 

Is the administration saying that

Services is responsible for recruiting 
and retaining students? As students, wc 
feel that this is just a bit one-sided. 

This is the some administration that 
is wasting 13,000 dollar on a study to 
decide whether or not child care is a 
problem on campus. 

Common sense would tell anyone 
that child care is a PROBLEM and the 
study is a complete waste of funds that 
could properly be used to install a child 

Frankly, the administration will Tind 
funds for the issues thai it really fmds 
significant and relevant. 

However some effort on the part of 
the administration to demonstrate thai 
minorities mean more than just dollars, 
would be nice.

When wc live by the labels of

means to be human. When we elevate 
societies' labels to a level of impor-

all. None of us has the right to deval-

Shame comes into play when we 
continue lo place societies' labels on

Letters to the editor 



Cartoon in need of research 



To the editor 

This letter is in response lo a cartoon 
that was published in your paper on 
March 17,1994. I do not know quite 
what to make of iL It appears that the 
cartoonist was attempting to be sarras- 
tic but I feel it missed its mark if this 
was its purpose. The cartoonist show a 
lack of understanding, not only of. 
American History, but also of our 
Native Peoples. 

The picture is historically inaccurate 
in its porurayal of the person George 
Washington in a Plains Indian setting. 
He never dealt with these tribes. He 
dealt with the Woodlands, and that was 
many years prior to reservation times. If 
it was meant that the character of 
Washington was representing the 



United Stales, then it would be more 
accurate, but still confusing. 

I fail to understand the significance 
of the woman whose hands arc raised 
above her head. Is she praying? Is she a 
medicine person? What docs this have 
to do with the total picture? What is the 
cartoonist attempting lo say? 

In the talk bubble it says: "What 
more can you possibly ask for 7' How 
about some real respect for us as a peo- 
ple? How about freedom of religion? 
How about Historical accuracy and 
freedom from stereotypes? 

The term SAVAt3ES is offensive in 

I am sure Ms. Myers means no dis- 
respect in presenting her work. Only 
she can tell what she was trying U&gt; por- 



tray. We. the families of (his njdon's 

when our culture is displayed in any 
fashion that we consider derogatory or 
stereotypical. Many of us feel as though 
we are POWs within our own country. 

One wonders if Ms. Myers has 
researched this topic prior to this pre- 
sentation of this cartoon? Obviouily all 
she left in the mind of ibis reader are 
questions.

Students cry victim too often 



To the editor 

Throughout my college career of 
the past few years, I have become 
increasingly aware of the fact that 
IPFW has become a campus filled with 
victims, a concept that is reinforced by 
The Communicator on a weekly basis 
I am writing a letter to enunciate that I 



I a 



n of r; 



,. I a 



not a victim of reverse racism. I am not 
a victim of sexism. I am not a victim of 
being misportrayed on campus. I am 
not a victim of rehgious discrimination. 



Certainly some people have made life 
more challenging, but I am not a help- 
less victim. 

If people spent more time diligeoUy 
improving their own lives and the lives 
of those around them, and spent less 
time moaning and complaining about a 
world that will always be inequitable. 
the question of being a victim of social 
ills would be moot. People would be 
too busy being successful to be worried 
about being victims. They would be 
active acbievcn. not passive helpless 



When I graduate this May, I will pat 
myself on the back and leave IPFW 
with d smiie. because I no longer have 
to deal with a campus of victims and 
will join the real world whem individu- 
als have control of their own lives and 
do not depend on victim status in order 
to be successful. The smile will contin- 
ue to linger due lo the fact Ihai success 
is so much sweeter when 
responsibility for failures. 



Child care continues 

to be an overlooked topic 



To the cditor- 

How soon will the campus address 
the issue of the lack of child care on 
campus? On-Site child care centers 
should be available to students with the 
Deed. The issue of on-site child care 
service is not new to the campus. The 
need for affordable child care exists 
throughout the area of Allen County. 
The benefit of a child care center is 
diveise. The implementation of a child 
care center is iflunedialely attainable. 
There are many students on campus in 
need of child core. Child care on cam- 
pus could be utilized by some of the 
students on campus, and could encour- 
age new snjdenis in need of child care 
to enroll at this campus. The benefit of 
parents having their children close by 
con only help the students excel in their 
academics. The implementing of child 
care would be a collaborative effort by 
both administrators and students thus 
showing understanding in the pohcy of 
Indian a- Purdue campus. 

The issue of a child care center on 
campus is not new. The need for child 
care is ever&gt;-where. 'There is a shortage 
everywhere, especially for quality child 
care. " said Pam Page. Resource 
Coordinator for Child Care of Allen 
County's Resource and Referral 
Service. Allen County tus a population 
of 300.000. According to the 1990 cen- 
sus 83.000 of that population U chil- 
dren under the age of IS. Many stu- 
dents on campus discuss their concerns 
about the lack of child care at IPFW 
campus. Fehcia Beeching discussed the 
lack of child care ai a Women's Studies 
forum on Gender issues. On another 
occasion. The Center for Women and 
Returning Adulu distributed flyers 
regarding their cooccm for the safety of 



childreo left unsupervised on the cam- 

The benefits of child care on cam- 
pus ore diverse. With the enrollment of 
Indiana-Purdue declining, as stated in 
■■The News Sentinel" article "Slate 
studies autonomy for IPFW," March 
10. 1994. the best way to increase the 
accessibility of higher education is to 
increase undergraduate not graduate 
offering. The article continues, "enroll- 
ment in most of the basic programs, 
although they are the state's highest pri- 
orities, has declined by one-third during 
the past five years, wrote Kevin 
Corcoran, author of the article. Child 
core on campus could be one way to 
generate new students Many students 
on campus receive funding for their 
children to receive child care Many 
programs, such as Job Works. Step 
Ahead, and Indiana Faculty and 
Children Services offer funding lo non- 
tradition students returning to college- 
Implementation of child care on our 
campus could be immediately attain- 
able. The Women's Studies Student 
Panel Forum offered several excellent 
suggestions for implementing afford- 
able child care on campus. One sugges- 
tion wot 10 utilize the students for the 
early childhood program here on cam- 
pus. The snjdents in this program could 
intern in a child care center on campos. 
Indiona Vocational Tech uUliies its 
students in thii capacity in several local 
child care centers, and so did Indiana- 
Purdue once- 

Twenty-sometbing years ago. IPFW 
had an on-site child care center The 
center moved off campus and Indiana 
VocaLonoI Technical coUege and The 
Fon Wayne Slate Development Center 
shared the child care center. By I9SS. 



Parkview Hospital Joined the others. 
The hospital and a brand new building 
this was the beginning of the end of 
IPF"Ws involvement in the child care 
center. The administrators charged the 
students with not having supported the 
service The students were not the 
downfall of the center for IPFW. IPFW 
was shafted at the lune of 5100,000. 
IPFW could no longer afford lo be a 
part of EducCare, the new name of the 
child care center, and bailed out Also, 
another suggestion for utilizing students 
is through the work study program. 
This would be a wonderful way to cre- 
ate new jobs for students to work with 
children. 

The need for a child core center, the 
bcnents of a child care center and the 
implementation of a child care center 
ore on the table Indiana-Purdue must 
get with the limes and stop waiting for 
others in the community to take ihe 
lead in providing for the current needs 
of students. College students are the 
future leaders with a vision of tomor- 
row. The vision includes child care cen- 
ters everywhere needed When will 
administrators listen to the discussion 
of mothers' and fathers' discussion of 
latch-key children of the inadequate 
ways in which the campus deals with 
this problem? Wlun will admmittraion 
heed the warning on flyers passed out 
by The Women and Returning Adults 
Center about unsupervised children on 
campus? The nee4 for adequate child 
core on this campus is a reahiy. This is 
not the ftrit time the campus has bad to 
deal with this issue. Now is the time to 
do it for the bencnt of the students and 
noljiai for the money.

Where's the outcry? 



b)rR»mon»McRo»n 
Edilar In chief 

On EutcT Sunday morning, I picked 
up Ihe .Suntliiy Joumnl Gaulle, only to 
Tind myielf inuncd lately perplexed 

There was an article about i young 
IDVi, John Preiiler. who happened to be 
Cdiculan «nd involved in gang activi- 
ly, Yel, ibe reporter who wrote (he (lory 
begin listing that (hli young man. "had 
lived ind breathed being black as much 
■I any black penon." 

Throughout the entire article Ibe 
lepoflcr covertly slipj in siereolypci 
Ihnt locicty tends lo associalc with 
Afric an ■ Am c ric ons . 

To Ibis reporter, I would Jtnte that 
being black hoi nothing lo do with gang 
activity or laking part Ihcreot. In stating 
this, I am no! suggesting that gangs arc 
nol In African-American neighbor- 
boodi; I am saying that they ore a port 
ot every ethnic neighborhood. The fact 
nmains that gang members from other 
ethnic groups do not gain as much 
altenlion from the media as African- 
Amerlcani. 

The uticie also quoted Pressler's 
mothei. who slated he was stating,"thal 
bo was a white boy living in a black 
boy's body." Is Ibis meant lo suggest 
thai Prcssler experienced the some prcj' 
udice Ihai most young Africon- 
American men feel every day? Some 
white Americans reading the moming 
paper would say lo themselves be was 
just behaving like most niggas do. The 
article almost seemed lo suggest that if 
Presstcr had not been associated with 
blacks, well then be would nol be in the 
predicament in which he found bimsclf. 

This type o( chiracierizalion is nol 
only insulting, but it is unfoitunalcly 



how some while and African- 
Amencani buy into the stereotypes thai 
arc perpetrated by the media. 

These tame persons will often be 
those who will be ibe HiM to get up«ei 
and benl out of shape with the ctrntni- 
vcrsial articles thai appear ihroughout 
The Communicator. 

Being black is a stale of mind. Ihal 
quite truthfully most white Americans 
could nol and would not endure, li lakes 



"Being black is 
a state of mind 
that quite truth- 
fully most white 
Americans 
could not and 
would not 
endure." 



a strong people to withstand and sur- 
vive 400 years of slavery; it takes a 
strong people to withstand day-in and 
day-out covert racism. Most while 
Americans would not tolerate the sim- 
ple fact that if they entered a store, tbcy 
would aimoil always be watched like a 
hawk bccou.';i; of Ihe color of their skin. 
They wouldn't iolerate_ that they often 
ore not helped at all in stores because, 
well "colored people simply do not 
have the funds." 

It takes a strong people to withstand 
being an actor in a role that must be 
played as a matter of sclf-preservalion 
African-Americans must behave and 



talk in a ceruin way in order to be both 
accepted and understood. We ore a peo- 
ple who are. as African-Americans, 
forced to live and adapt to the white 
dominant culture and still try to keep 
what lUtle of our own culture we have. 

As a young African-American. I 
sometimes wish that 1 could leave my 
black consciousness at home as ii seems 
ibai the author of the Prcsiler article 
chose lo do. When I slate leaving my 
consciousness al home. I am referring 
to the mental eibausiion that is caused 
through dealing with the day-to-day 
problems and games Ibal while people 
play and particularly while women. In 
doing so, I guess I could preteml that 1 
do not see Ihe blatani political and 
social games Ihal occur everyday, and 
live lo please the white man. But fortu- 
nately I have people in my life that I 
can trust and talk with candidly about 
situations that I often find myself in. 
Pressler apparently did nol 

Pressler may have had African- 
American friends, girlfriends, and lis- 
tened to rap music(whatever thai is sup- 
[tosed to mean) but he had no clue as to 
what IS like being an Afric an -American. 
For Ihe record) il is not listening lo rap 
music, and wearing your pants half way 
down your behind. Pressler and olher 
young African- Americans who choose 
10 involve Ihemsclves with people, 
blnck or while. Ihot lake pan in dcsiruc- 
live gang activity have given up a cer- 
tain amount of self-respect for ihem- 
sclves and anyone around ibcm. even 
those who Ihcy call family within their 
own "gang "

The cur/eni banJ riding aiop ihe

indie ruck iccne it known u Pavement 
llili leemi a Fitting nunc considering 
Ihal Iheir new album 'Crooked Rain, 
Crooked Rain' ii strong and solid 
Ihroughoul, 

While liileniog lo the album I got 
Ihe seme that Ihis hand wai trying lo 
gel n messBge ocross in mnny of Ihe 
longi. This mcttage iccmcd to pro- 
claim ihat nM:k u we know it i; dying 
and like a vampire resimecicil ftom Ihe 
dead homclhing similar bul more 
unique IS taking it's place. A phrase 
from the song "Newark Wilder" states 
"It's a brand new era/And it fecU 
gfcttl" which refers to the growing pop- 
ulnrily o( oltcmaiivc music. 

Tlie five member band h lead by 
vocalist and guiiahii Stephen Malkmus 
along with guilariii Spiral Stairs, drum- 
met Steve West, percussionist Bob 
Noslanovicb, and bassist Mark Ibold. 

Tile first four tracks on the album 
Die tremendous and quickly demon- 
tirate a style both unique and catchy. 
Mallunus's vocals come across effec- 
tively as sounding non-cholant yet still 
being powerful. 

The fu^t release from the album. 
"Cut Your Hair", is an especially 
catchy song. The all musical track "5 n 
"1= Unity" is totally unlike anything 
else on the album which shows Ihe vcr- 



taUlily of the band. In both "Cut YouT 
Hair " and 'Fillmore live" there are 
bnef moments of cicellent noisy guitar 
that show i glimpse of similarity to the 
British underground group My Bloody 
Valentine. 

The only problem I had with what 
I consider a great album were the nega- 
tive references to both Smashing 
Pumpkins and Stone Temple Pilots in 
the laid back yet vicious 'Range Life" 
I have adored Smashing Pumpkins 
music since the far from mainstream 
olbum"Glsh." 

I disagree with bantls such as 
Pavement who feel thai they aie a sell- 
out band thni has lost all meaning just 
because of their unavoidable populari- 
ty. 

I also find it ironic that both 
Smashing Pumpkins and Pavement 
have two great songs right next to each 
other on the olbum 'No Alternative' 
which are not available on their current 
albums. 

Overall 'Crooked Rain, Crooked 
Rain' is a must for anyone who truly 
loves alternative music. 

On a totally different note, for any- 
one who is a die hord Cure fan like 
myself there is a new previously urue- 
leased song by them on the new sound- 
track from the movie 'The Crow'. 

Also there arc rumors flying 
around that Robert and company have 
been spotted in the studio off and on 
and perhaps a new album is in (he mak-

Monday. I went straight home from 
school to watch Ihe new sitcom, "704 
Hauser." This new series it produced 
by veteran television producer Nortnon 
Lear and takes place in the same house 
of the former controversial sitcom, "All 
in the Family." 

The debut sbow introduces the 
Cumberback family. The Cumberbacks 
ore an African -Am eric an comprising of 
s liberal (for all that's worth) black 
father Emic(Iohn Amos), the sictcoiyp- 
icol religious black mother named Rose 
(Lynnie Godfrey) and the catalyst of 
conflict in the family is tbc son 
Thutgood Marshall Cumberback (T.E. 
Russell), 

The show opened with Thurgood 
a.k.a. Goodie and his white, Jewish 
girlfriend Chcrlyn discussing the fact 
that he won't tell his parents about their 
love for each other. 

Of course, there hod lo be some dia- 
logue between Goodie and bis patents 
about his relationship with the white 
girl. It's obvious from the Black 
Muslim symbolism (Brnic's boWtic) 
that his father and mother do not agree 
with his choice of having a white 
female companion. 

I think it's quite ironic that the pro- 



ducers of this show decided lo 
Goodie fall in love wiih a Jewish 
woman considering the underlying ten- 
sion that lies between people of the 
Jewish faith and African -Americans. It 
will be Interesting in teeing what direc- 
tion the producers take those two char-

Tlie 



only problem 1 have with the 
ibow is the fact that the critics have 
labeled the views of Goodie and Enue 
to be ultra-conservative and liberal. I 
have a problem with this because once 
again folks ore once trying to define 
African -Am eric an individuals. 

For instance. Goodie says in a con- 
versation with his father. "A man can 
be block without feeling like a victim." 

How is that ultra-conservative? 1 
don't think so. I think that is a valid 



I think with the exchange of racially 
charged language such as spooky, oreo. 
eight-ball, and nigger some critics will 
use this method as a venue lo attack 
the sbow and label it as being contro- 
versial. 

By the way, for Ihose of you who 
don't agree with my viewpoints, there 
will be a student panel held on April IS 
in Classroom Medical Room 100 to dis- 
cuss the content of the paper. I suggest 
thai all of you come out and let your 
voic« be heard.

'Threesome' displays kinky love triangle 



b_v Jamie Carver 
SlafT writer 

■'Biiane Love Triangle ■' 

TTiis is the liiJe of die song by New 
Order used in the film "ThreeSome " 
and pretty much sums up the movie in 
those three words. Okay, perhaps four 
words are needed here: Very bizarre 
love triangle. 

I entered the movie theater with 
low expeclations for this film. I just 
bad a bad feeling thai this was going to 
be your average run of the mill tt\ 
flick about iwo guys vying for who will 
lay the sexy woman of Ihe film 

This movie turned out to be yuur 
classic boy wants giil but girl wants 
other boy-but thai boy wants the 
boy that wants Ihe girl. Confusing? 
Strange? 

No. Try bizarre 

The film starts out with Eddy (Josh 
Charles) a junior transferring lo UCLA. 
There is immediately a clash between 
Eddy and his roommate Stuart (Stephen 
Bladwin, the youngest of the Baldwin 
brothers,) 

Eddy is the smart, modem inlcl- 
lectuol while Stuart is a beer guzzling, 
girl chasing idiot. What really makes 
the story interesting is when Alex. 
(Lara Flynn Boyle) is also assigned to 
their living quarters because of an 



crT0f^4he computer system a&lt; the uni- 
venity "auumes" thai Alex is a man's 

Atet It almost immediately attract- 
ed to Ifddy and she Inei (quite humor- 
ously) to arouse him. In the meantime 
Stuon has made it his love mission to 
bag the ie»y Alex What abooi Eddy? 
Well, you receive a string him oboui 
who Eddy is interested In by the way he 
keeps Healing peeks at Stuart's ast and 
the disinterest he shows towards the 
very penuasive Alex. 

I was surprised to find myself 
laughing continuously tbrviughout Ihe 
movie There is one interestingly 
humorous moment when Alex refers to 
Eddy as a closet heleiosexual because 
of her belief that deep down he really 
docs want her. 

The three become very close 
friends and the chemistry between them 
is unique Tkc three friends make a 
pact that no one will become involved 
with the other to safeguard Ibeir friend- 
ship but the pact does not last long. 

Stuart sleeps with Alex. Then 
Eddy, who is not completely sure of his 
homosexuality, also sleeps with Alex. 
Eddy finds that sex with a woman isn't 
all that great, so he decides to hit on 
Stuart whom he is convinced is a clas- 
sic case of a closet homosexual, Stuart 



very discreeUy asaurci Eddy that he \% 
not 

"nMn Ihe chmax (excuse Ihe pun) 
of the film IS when in a sweet tender 
moment Eddy. Siuart, and Alex engage 
in an intettsling threesome. 

I believe the word was "bizarre." 
At die cod of the film Ihc iniunacy 
between Ihe three slowly starts to take 
its loll on Ibeir fricndsbip. Surprisingly 
Siuan is the one who experiences moral 
confusion and guilt while all three drift 
from the close tics of their group to 
contemplate what is happening between 

The semester ends, and ihey each 
decide that it would he best if they did 
not room together the next semester. 
They give their farewells and port from 
one another You can sense the deep 
feelings of sadness between each of 

Anyone who has graduated or 
moved and has had lu leave behind 
close friends and can relate lo the lad 
question ajked by Eddy: How can peo- 
ple who are so close at one lime 
become noncxislcnl in one another's 
lives? 

If you like a movie that is funny. 
shockingly sexy and a lilllc sad, then I 
recommend 'ThreeSome' as a good 
movie lo see.
