More Airport Restrictions 



Once again the United States 
was the target of a terrorists attack. 
Homeland Security Secretary Michael 
Cherloff said, "the terrorists planned 
to use liquid explosives disguised as 
beverages and other common products 
and detonators disguised as electronic 
devices." The attack involved flights 
from the United Kingdom to the Unit- 
ed States targeting major airports in 
New York, Washington and California. 
As many as 50 people were involved 
in the plot and the suspected terror- 
ists had been under survillance since 
last December. Twenly-four have been 



arrested so far with one being let go 
without charges, authorities believe 
these 23 are the "main players" in the 
plot. 

The odd thing about the at- 
tacks was that the terriorst did not 
purchase any tickets or passports 
for travel. Some believe this might 
suggest that the tcmorists were just 
prancing for the real thing and with 
the 5th anaversery of 9-11 coming up 
some speculate this attack might have 
something to do with thai Officials 
are investigating further upon this at- 
tack; this could take up to si\ weeks. 



What docs this mean to the 
Uniied States beyond the fact that we 
arc reminded of the anger and hate 
some people feel towards us? 

For starters lighter airport 
security, which may in the long run 
result in pricier ticket fees due to the 
hiring of more emploees. Another 
change involves tighter enforcement 
on carry on items. You are no longer 
allowed to carry on liquids ranging 
from hand cream and hair products 
to water bottles and wine. British 
.uiiliorilies have tunned clcctroiiii de- 



New Student Housing 



vices from being carried aboard. These 
items range from our beloved IPods to 
cell phones, "At this point and time is it 
unclear how long these restrictions will 
remain in place," said Tony Douglas, 
Heathrow's airport manager. The items 
thut arc banned from carry on ore al- 
lowed in the checked baggage though. 
If you are planning on travel- 
ing anytime soon make sure you show 
up two hours early. This will make 
your travel less stressful and help out 
the airport security. 



Problems for 
BP Once More 




By Kira Schowe 

Were you left out last year 
from the thrill of Student Housing? 
Well no need to cry this year because 
that won't happen again! IPFW is cur- 
rently adding two additional student 
housing buildings to the seven current 
ones. The buildings will consist of 188 
new beds and 68 new units. The build- 
ings are set to be livable by Fall 2007. 

The new housing units are 
furnished with the exact furniture and 
appliances as the older ones so, there 
is no additional cost and better yet no 



requirements to live in them. 

There are two minor differ- 
ences between the old buildings .ind 
the new ones. For starters, one of the 

kidding has lour stories while the oth- 
ers only have three. The other differ- 
ence is the new buildings will have no 
lounges. The lounges will be replaced 
with computer labs because there was 
such a high demand for them in the past 



people'' That question has a simple 
answer. There are plenty of campus ac- 
tivities and events thai will allow you 
to meet new people, also just because 
your dorm doesn't have a lounge there 
are seven others that do; mingle. 

So, come Fall 2007 get to en- 
joying Student Housing life, meet new 
people and gain that extra 30 minute 
sleeping time that would have 
consisted of travel lime in the past. 



Senator Bayh Speaks at Job Fair

Over 900 Northeast Indiana

numerous local companies at the Evan

Many job seekers were in

place in the Walb ballroom on iPFW's 
campus. 

"You could feel the excite-

Carrier, president and CEO of Briljani. 
LLC. "There were people standing 
outside just waiting to get in." 

United Stales Senator Evan

BP was forced to shut down 
12 oil wells about three weeks ago, 
ihey expeel lo replace them within the 
next few months, this is about half of 
the oil production in (he Alaska North 
Slopes. In money terms this adds up lo 
400,000 barrels per day and a barrel is 
running around SUS74.76. But on a 
good nole, "We're in prelly reasonable 
shape. ..there are adequate supplies to 
make up for ihe loss to West Coast re- 
fineries. Oil can be diverted from other 
producers, including Saudi Arabia and 
Mexico," said Energy Secretary Samu- 
el W. Bodman. 

So, what caused the closer? 
The company blamed "unexpectedly 
severe corrosion" but coincidcnlly BP 
has had problems with the sort of "un- 
expectedly" before. For example five 
months ago, BP's aging pipeline cre- 
ated the largest oil spill on Alaska's 
North Slope ever. "I think it was pre- 
ventable," said Phil Flynn, an energy 
analyst, "they're playing Russian rou- 
lette up there." In some places pipeline 
walls have lost as much us 80 percent 
of their thickness as a result of corro- 

No surprise Ihe allegations 
concerning BP's maintenance practices 
have led to a criminal investigation to 
find out if BPhas deliberately cut down 
on maintenance and forged records to 
cover it up; the real question being was 
it deliberate? "Absolutely," said Chuck 
Hamel, a longtime nemesis of the oil 
company, "they did it to save money." 
In a interview a federal official in 
charge of pipeline safety charged BP 
with inadequate maintenance for 15 

The BP pipeline system has 
major environmental challenges. This 

and streams, three mountain ranges, 
and three major active faults. On a 
positive side the construction of the 
pipeline is a zigzag pattern so. this 
allows for contraction during tem- 
perature changes as well as movement 
from possible earthquakes. These facts 
might explain why mosl oil pipelines 
in Alaska have exceeded their 25-year 
life design and ihey are. as corrosion 
expert Bill Hedges said. " in excellent 

The maintenance for these 
pipelines consists of sending "smart 
pigs" into the pipes. "Smart pigs" arc 
mechanical devices that check for cor- 
rosion that can cause leaks; BP also 
conducts ultrasounds lo check ihe 
pipes. Because of these test most leaks 
are minor and quickly delected. Ac-

pipeline under question was checked

Freshmen Fest a Hit 



■ '■:■ :&gt;: ; 



On Aug 18, 1.200 new 
faces showed up on IPFW's 
campus for the second annual 
Freshmen Fcsi. 

The day consisted of six dif-

staff, Real World College Ed.,

cializes in college orientations, 
started out (he day with a little 
game called, "Step Forward." 
Audrey Moore, the Assistant 
Director of Student Life, de- 
scribed this as ■"speed dating,' 
you get out there and meet as 
many people as you can in that 
hour and a half." 

Another activity of the day 
was the Real World College Ed. 
During this time the freshmen 
were introduced to the realities 
of college life. "In high school 
you are directed to speak. Col- 
lege is different, here you have 
10 go out of your way to find 
answers, you're not forced", 
said Moore.

Director of 

Student Life, 

described this 

(Play Fair) as 

"speed dating,'

and meet as 
many people as 
you can in that

"It was really helpful. 1 met t 
lot of new people and it made il 
easier to find my classes", said 
Blake Ridenour. 



Others felt differently, "I 
think they tried to make people 
interact to much. If people want 
to make friends they will do it". 
s.in.l \&lt;l,im McBride. 

When asking Moore if Stu- 
dent Life will be planning the 
fest in the future she said, "Yes, 
Freshmen Fest will continue. 
We have found that it has re- 
ally worked well for students." 
Moore explained that the fest 
used to be condensed into one 
day's time until facility mem-

events and realized splitting

the pipeline has not affected the 
price of gasoline drastically but 
how long will that last. With 
the fear of the world's oil sup- 
ply peaking and the war in the 
Middle East that question is on 
everyone's mind. Pessimists 
predict thai the world's oil sup- 
ply will decline within the next 
few years, while Optimists be- 
lieve there is plenty of oil to 
meet the worldwide demand un- 
lil around 2030, The exact time 
of a worldwide oil peak is un- 
predictable hut everyone knows 



for it. 

This doesn't mean you 
need to go out right now and 

run on a fuel replacement or 
solar power, we have a while. 
Just lake one problem at a time 
because with the history or 
gasoline and oil we should be 
experiencing another dramatic 
increases in prices within the 
ncvi few months. 



"This growing gap 
between the haves, and have 
nots, is very much based on 
education." said Bayh. 

The Senator went 
on to not only talk about the 
numerous job opportunities rep- 
resented at the fair, but also to 
encourage individuals interest- 
ed in starting a small business 
to speak with representatives 
at the fair about small business 
start up loans and other infor- 
mative advice. 

"Small businesses have cre- 
ated tens of millions of jobs," 
said Bayh.

Tuition Costs are Outpricing Students 



By Tiffany Dirig 



I'm sure that I'm not very differ- 
ent from too many of my colle- 
giate counterparts in that I'm one 
poor little girl. I mean, we're talk- 
ing so poor that all I have in my 
fridge is water, a single Corona, 
and some apple juice. My cabi- 
nets lay bare save some spaghetti 
sauce {I have no pasta) and a box 
of Marsh mac and cheese — please 
bear in mind that we are sans 
Marsh now. So, imagine how 
my lofty goals of taking 16 credit 
hours were dashed when 1 got my 
bill from the IPFW Bursar's Of- 
fice. After my oh-so-inadequate 
Stafford loan, I was still expected 
to pay over 1500 bucks! That's lu- 
dicrous; particularly when I hadn't 
even thought about books, yet. 

All I want to do is graduate, 
folks. Naturally, I thought if I 
piled on the classes I'd be able to 
get out faster. Well, that's all well 
and good ... in theory. 'Course it 
didn't occur to me until my little 
love note from the Bursar that I 
can't afford to do that. I pose this 



a scholarship for awhile, but have 
since sucked it dry. 

Anyway, I digress. Our beloved 
IPFW charges approximately $200 
per credit hour for students (I'm 
rounding, here). Is that really 
necessary? Seriously! Why do 
we — the poor schleps just trying 
to make ourselves better equipped 
to function in this big, bad 
world— have to pay so dearly for 
it!? Because of this inexplicable 
need to charge us out the wahzoo, 
I had to drop from 16 hours to six. 
At this rate, I'll NEVER graduate. 
And, if I do, I'm going to have to 
take over for Bill Gates to pay all 
the money back; especially since I 
have to go to grad school, too. 



Myc 



ithev 



I'm friends with a girl who gradu- 
ated with her Bachelor's — "Bach- 
elor's" being the key word here — 
owing over 60 grand!! That's 
ridiculous. I heard a rumor once 
that there are schools out there 
that charge $30 per credit hour 
for in-sta*te residents. Ohmygod. 
1 wouldn't even know where to 
start. I'd end up taking, like, eight 
classes a semester. Why can't

ate, folks. Naturally, I thought if I 
piled on the classes I'd be able to

question to you. Howin the H-E- 
Double- Hockey-Sticks can I make 
my puny $3500 allotment last an 
entire year while taking a full load 
each semester? Two words: I can't! 

Here's my proof. I've lived in 
Indiana all my life and I've been 
in Fort Wayne for most of it. I 
started college right out of high 
school (almost five years ago), 
but decided to take a few semes- 
ters off; thinking it'd do me good. 
Well, long story short, I've been 
back for six semesters and am 
already almost $10,000 in school- 
loan debt — that's not even includ- 
ing the loan from my very first 
semester. I made sure to pay that 
off before I came back; all $2500 
of it! The only reason my debt 
load's not higher is because I had 



IPFW be like that? Why can't every 
school, for that matter? 

Here's the worst part. Not 
only are colleges and universi- 
n&lt;A*-r iL'li.hni'^.i drht laden 
generation; they're facilitating the 
increasing drop-out rates. If I had 
kids and it 







not lompk'idy ohiuse. i rec- 
ognize the need for technology 
fees and whatnot. But IPFW has 
a boatload of students; don't we, 
collectively, cover the fees ade- 
quately!? If not, there's something 
incredibly wrong. 

Where else does the money 
go? It's not like IPFW is some tiny, 
private college on the East Coast. 
(Nothing against those tiny, pri- 
vate, East Coast schools.) There 
were over 1 1 ,000 in -state students 
in 2005 alone. Let's assume, for 
easy mathematical sakes, that all 
of those 1 1 ,000 students were new 
and they all took 12 credit hours. 



do we have to show for it? I know mean, I hate taking courses on- 
that our professors don't get paid line; but if that's what it takes to 
a whole heck of a lot. With what graduate. I'll do it in a heartbeat! 
does that leave us? Some new I guess it boils down to the fact

Freshman Get Involved! 



By Heather Etzler 



If you are a freshman and you 
were anything like me starting col- 
lege was an adventure. I was ex- 
cited to leave my hometown and 
house yet nervous about how my 
roommates and professors would 
be like. I had about five people I 
knew that were going to the same 
college as me. How was I going to 
make friends? 

Freshmen, I'm here to tell you 
there is hope; is it called students 
activities. At IPFW there are cur- 
rently 87 student organizations on 
campus. One of my biggest regrets 
was that I did not get involved my 
first year. Getting involved has 
many benefits such as: way to 
make friends, stress reliever, and 
something to do. 

If you miss being involved in 
a religious organization IPFW 
offers Campus Ministries, Global 
Christian Fellowship, InterVarsity 
Christian Fellowship, Spiritual 
and Pagan Student Alliance. If you 



like planning events and inter- 
acting with students on campus 
join Student Activities Board or 
Student Government. If you miss 
sports join an intramural. If you 
still do not know what to join a lot 
of majors on campus also have 

So now you might ask yourself 
where am I suppose to find out 
where and when these activities 
start? Well a good place to start 
is by looking at the bulletins 
throughout campus. There are 
always flyers about activities that 
are or will be going on. Flyers are 
normally on the walls by stairs 
throughout campus and also 
posted On doors; it's hard not to 

You can also ask your depart- 
ment about the different ac- 
tivities going on. If you live on 
campus ask any RA you see. You 
can also look at lPFWs homep- 
age: click on University Life, then 
click on Student life. 

Make your freshman year 
memorable, join some activi- 
ties you like and enjoy your first 



IPFW Offers Large Campus 
Opportunity Close to Home 



By Jenna Tompkins 



1 am one of those students 
who always said that 1 was go- 
ing to go away to school. Iliad 
dreams of sharing my dorm 
room with some girls that would 
eventually become my best 
friends, frat parties, sororities, 
and all-nighters. Granted I grew 
up in DeKalb County, but Fort 
Wayne is still pretty dang close 
to home. So during high school 
when people would ask why I 
didn't want to go to IPFW my 
response was "It's too close to 
home and it is not big enough!" 

Nowajuniorherea IPFW with 
my own apartment located in 
"The Only Place to Live", Can- 
terbury Green, I am really glad I 
didn't go away to school. IPFW 
oilers me so much of whata 



large t ampus &lt; mild give and 

First of alt there is the tuition. 
We all know that it is not the 
cheapest tuition in town but it is 
not outrageous. Really, you are 
getting a quality education at a 
discount. The class sizes can't be 
beat. You can nearly rely on one 
on one time with your professor 
if necessary. And on more than 
one occasion I have had a class 
with less than 10 students in it. 
Talk about a nice class size. 

We as students have a lot of 
things such as accessible to us as 
well. Perhaps not as much as a 
larger campus but what can you 
expect we aren't one. Aside from 
the current construction IPFW's 
campus is appealing to the eye. 
IPFW has recently constructed 
dorms adding some charm to the 
university for those out of town 
students or those who just don't 



want to live at home any more. 
The down side to the student 
housing here is that we do not 
offer a cafeteria for the students 
as opposed to dorms, which have 
a cafeteria. This only means that 
the students are in need of trans- 
portation to get to the grocery 

The last thing I want to hit on is 
school pride. I think IPFW is great 
but I'll admit that I have never 
been to a sporting event or even a 
theater production. Why? Be- 

the events that take place here 
unless there is free food. Thank- 
fully we are getting involved with 
a conference so that our sports 
teams will get the credit they 
deserve and so we can love IPFW 
the way others love Notre Dame or 
USC. I mean if you think about it 
IPFW is the way to go. 






Here's Some Helpful Tips 



By Kira Schowe 



Some of us dread them, oth 
ers accept them, while the 
majority of us make a living 
from them. They're called 
tips. 

In society, tipping is a way to 
thank someone for a 
service provided. The abbrevia 
tion "tips" stands for, 
to insure proper service. 

People have different view: 
on proper tipping and 
this becomes apparent when 
asking around Il'FW. For 
example some students be 
lieved in gratuity being added 
into each bill, "sometimes peo 
pie just don't know how 
much to give the server." An 
Dther was against gratuity 
s tat m g t hat, "gratuity makes it 



complicated for 
people because they don't al- 
ways feel the server 
should get what the gratuity is." 
But one thing 

everyone could agree with was 
the idea that with 

the 10-15% tip rule 
should be raised. 
Then there is the 



that, "tips 



said they tip. But if you fre- ma.

to be remembered as a are discounts and coupons,

you could imagine and I think if 
everyone had to serve 
for a week, they would be more 
generous when they

But don't just focus your new

about your hair dresser, 
that limo driver, or a bartender? 
Treat them well and 
they will do the same. Because 
in the end. however you 
choose to handle them, we all 
have to deal with tips 
one way or another. 



Indiana Sniper is Product of Media 



By Said El-Adjani 



An attempt to kill a randoi 
driver in the state of Indiana 
has been thwarted again by the 
laws of physics. The sniper is 
still out there, investigators are 
on the case, and an ottoman 
is the only available evidence. 
Should we. as Hoosiers, or 
should 1 Nay Americans, be 
scared? Is the war on terror hit- 
ting in front of our very door- 
step? And more importantly, 
what should we do now? 

So, who are the possible 
suspects here? 

First, it was a 17 year old 
teenager by the name of Zach- 
uriah Blanton at one point. 
Blanton. who after squabbling 
with family over a deer car- 
cass, took his anger out onto 



the road. Armed with a rifle, he 
killed one man, injured an- 
other, and grazed the head of a 
third. He is now possibly faced 
with charges of attempted 
murder. 

With more than likely 
no correlation to Blan- . . . 
ton, another vigilante 
has taken the stage and 
fired upon multiple 
moving vehicles. 1 do 



for bullets, when all they found information regarding the 

were pebbles. Needless to say, weapon? Of course not- es- 

neither the FBI nor the newly pecially not the news. Their 

created Task Force can prove concern is how much fear they 

whether this sniper was actu- should install into the Ameri- 
can people. Negative

another vigilante me media feeds u 






an experienced sniper. 
No one has been killed 
but many windows have 
been shattered. At least 
we got the law cleaning up 
the roadsides. If the so called 
so Task Force put their heads 
together, they might have think 
searching the vehicles as well. 
Too bad they gave up looking

»-■■ ti i , „ i „ for breakfast, lunch, 

fired upon multiple an ddir 



ally using a sniper.. .or a gun. 
One source stated that police 
have not identified the sniper's 
weapon, noting it could be a BI 
gun or even a slingshot. 
Does the media report this 



for people 
to understand, that 
the news is not about 
the snipet Clearly, 
this sniper is no 
threat. We see a kid who ac- 
cidentally murdered a guy, and 
now a person that might have 
a slingshot and be doing it on 
purpose.. .but sucks- and as- 
sume that the highways aren't 



safe. And what does the media 
tell us? The "sniper" might 
actually intensify his actions... 
Right now.. .this is just a.. .game. 
And it is. The game is called 
fear installation. And without 
the purchase of cable, you can 
get it for free. 

These are times, we as Amer- 
icans should decide whether or 
not to live in fear. The news is a 
negatively connotated, visually 
depressing, and overly repeti- 
tive source for information, 
which in turn raises ones blood 
pressure and builds a bad 
attitude. I personally choose 
to leave my fate in the hands 
of God, and not worry about 
whether or not 1 will be shot by 
These could be scary times if 
you choose to let them be. 



Do you feel prepared for college? 



Said El-Adjani poled students during Freshman Fest to see 
how they felt about the upcoming year. 




"For the most part, yeah. 

1 suppose I'm ready to go. 

Everybody's been pretty 

friendly." 

Cassidy Hodges

Daycare Brings Friendly Security to 
Parents and Children 



By Allison Graber 
Chief Reporter 



Quietly a young girl stands be- 
fore the yellow door at 4133 Hob- 
son Road. Grabbing her mother's 
leg, she hugs her stuffed animal. 
A smiling woman opens the door 
and greets the girl and her mother. 

The smiling greeter is Lynda 
Place, Director of the IPFW Child- 
Lynda has been the director at this 
center for nine years. 

The childcare serves over 150 
children, ages two through twelve, 
during the fall and spring semes- 
ters, as well as a smaller number 
during the summer. 

The bright colored doors of 
green, orange, yellow and red, 



along with the playground in the 
backyard, give people driving by a 
clue as to the function nlthe brick 
building. 

The classrooms are as color- 
ful as the doors on the building, 
filled with bulletin boards that 
say things like. 'We're learning 
about bugs.' Centers with toys and 
learning activities are strategi- 
cally spread throughout the rooms 
while Big Bird holds balloons on 
one classroom wall. 

Open to children of students, 
faculty and staff of IPFW, the 
childcare provides part time care 
at hours that make it unique to the 
community. The center is open 
from 7:45 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., Mon- 
days through Thursdays and 7:45 
a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Fridays. 

Although the part time care is 



beneficial lor many IIM-'W fathers 
and mothers, it can create a chal- 
lenge for the four full time staff 
and 20 part-time workers. "It's 
very difficult when we have chil- 
dren coming and going all day," 
Lynda said, but added later that 
their curriculum, called Creative 
Curriculum, is conducive to their 
set up. Four goals oi development 
found in the childcare- curriculum 
are social/emotional, physical, 
cognitive, and language. 

"It is based a lot on teacher- 
child interaction and teacher 
child-observation," Lynda said. 
animit'iiiingoii the approach the 
childcare takes toward teaching. 
The children spend their days 
learning, playing in centers and 
pi, lying outdoors, with time to 
spare for a short rest time in the 



afternoon. Edna Neal. vi&gt; 
cellor of Student Affairs, \ 
to point out; "We have so 
creative teachers over (Ik 
The center is licensee)

. State 



licensed daycares have ahij 
standard of rules to follow in order 
to keep in business. Even though 
it is not required of diem, the 
childcare strives to follow most of 
the licensing regulations. 

Affiliated with Student Affairs, 
the center finds it important to 
assess the needs of the IPFW com- 
munity in regards to childcare. 
A task force has been created to 
pinpoint the needs. One member 
of the task force is Edna Neal, She 
explained that a survey has been 
made available to all students and 
includes questions about the cost 



of sending a child to the center 
as well as questions regarding the 
need for services. The childcare 
needs assessment can be found 
onyourmy.ipfw.edu portal under 
IPFW surveys. 

Despite the availability of 
surveys online, as well as displays, 
brochures and signs, one of the 
main problems Lynda Place finds 
is the lack of knowledge about the 
center. "We still had a lady come 
in yesterday thai said she didn't 
even know we're here." Lynda ex- 
plained. She then added, "I want 
people to know we're here!"

Orientation 
Program Helps 
Freshman Soar 



By Allison Graber 
Chief Reporter 



Thoughts of uncertainty and 
excitement fill the minds of many 
new students making their way to 
IPFW for their first day of classes. 

A change from the high school 
schedule is daunting for some 
freshman, yet exhilarating for oth- 
ers. The questions and hesitancies 
that fill new student's minds can 
be addressed by SOAR. 

SOAR is a program z 
signed to alleviate somi 
of freshman entering in' 
hrst experience at college. 

Standing for Student Orientation, 
Advising and Registration, SOAR 
events begin during the summer, 
and last until school begins. 

Lori Beth Miller is the Director 
of Student Life and coordinates the 
SOAR program. She finds that the 
advising is the most important as- 
pect of SOAR. "The goal of SOAR," 
she says, "is that students have a 
hard copy of their schedule in their 
hands so they know-what to ex- 

The SOAR executive report 
numbers the amount of incom- 
ing freshman registered to attend 
SOAR events during summer of 
2006 at over 3,000. 

At the Freshman Fest, held on 
August 18, students were wel- 
comed into the IPFW community 
by professors, advisors and others 
connected with IPFW. The Fresh- 
man Fest is the bash before the 
school year begins to give fresh- 
man a chance to meet new people 
and to ask any further questions 
they might have. 

Shavonne Jackson, an incom- 
ing freshman from Concord High 
School, was at the Freshman Fest 
for over three hours. She spent the 
morning getting her student id, 
doing group activities, and meet- 
ing new people. There were over 
1200 others like her attending the 



Fest. 

The planning that goes 
into the SOAR program begins very 
early on. Dates are already picked 
for the 2007 schedule. The 2006 
SOAR program will be discussed 
and evaluated in order to make 
sure the needs of the students 
have been met and to assess what 
changes need to be made. 

Over 20 members of the SOAfl 
committee collaborate at least 
once a month to prepare for future 
events and discuss needs. 

Revamped in the 2004-2005 
school year, the SOAR program 
has relied on research to under- 
stand the needs and wants of the 
students. Some of these concerns, 
Lori Beth points out, are academic 
performance as well as finding the 
right class on the first days of col- 



Open CASA Kicks Off 
New School Year 



By Allison Graber 
Chief Reporter 



Help is the one word on the 
minds of students when that 
hard project or paper is as- 
signed. Instead of worrying and 
fretting about an assignment, 
an option for rescue is CASA. 

CASA stands for the Center 
for Academic Support and Ad- 
vancement and provides ser- 
vices to students which include 
the Writing Center, the Math 
Testing Center, tutoring, work- 
shops, English as a second lan- 
guage advising and other per- 
sonalized services. 

"We're sort of like this um- 
brella unit that covers all the 
academic support, 1 ' Rachelle 
Darabi. the Director of the Aca- 
demic Success Program, said. 
Found in the basetnent of Ket- 
tler Hall, the hallway that hous- 
es CASA seems to have a pleth- 
ora of doors to choose from to 
receive help from trained stu- 
dents and faculty. 

Mary Arnold Schwartz, As- 
sistant Director of the Writing 
Center, was enthusiastic about 
the opportunities available to 
students at the Writing Cen- 
ter. "Our motto is every writer 
needs a reader," she said. The 
Writing Center is host to stu- 
dents who need help with theii 
writing skills. 

Another branch of CASA is 
the Math Testing Center. Open 
to students with disabilities as 
well as those signed up for flex 
pace classes, the center pro- 
tests at your own speed as well 
as take tests over if you are not 
pleased with your grade. 

Over 24,000 students used the 
services of CASA over the past 
year. Rachelle Darabi pointed 
out, "It's a very positive environ- 
ment, some people practically 
live here." 

CASA was formed in the early 
1970s under a different name. 
In 2000 it transitioned into the 
Center for Academic Support 
and Advancement. Recognized

ing Center Association as re-

Step Up is a Step Down 



By Tiffany Dirig 
Overall Rating = 1.5 stars 



Well, comrades, I'm back for yel another 
fun-filled semesler of cinematic ranting and 
raving. I know the three of you that read my 
reviews have missed me. This time's going 
to be no different from the last ... at least 1 
don't think it will be. I'll hit up two or three 
movies a week and then pass my oh-so- 
opinionated knowledge on to you. Each 
film will be given an overall rating based 
upon acting, writing, cinematography, and 
plot. It will be a O-to-5-star scale; with "0" 
meaning the flick's utter crapolla and the il- 
lustrious, nearly unattainable "5" being the 
best movie I've seen all year. Here we go!! 

I decided to start this year with a bang 
OK, not exactly Hrully, ii began with a low. 
barely audible, sizzle, Why is this, you ask? 
I'll tell you why; I went to see "Step Up". De- 
fore you start guffawing and put the paper 
down, though, lel me defend myself, When 
I first saw the trailers for this movie, I knew 
it was going to suck big time. But I have a 
theory thai I pui into place for movies such 
as this. If you go in expecting it to be bad. 
you can'l be disappointed. It's impossible 
You know that it's going to be dreadful, so 
how can you upset when it is? You can't. 
However, you can be excited when you find 
that you've had a good time at the cinema. 
That's exactly what happened to me. 

Somehow. I managed to coerce my friend 
and my mother into seeing this flick with 
me— though neitherwas too pleased. I kept 
telling them to give it a chance. If nothing 
else it'd be fun. It was. 

"Step Up", like "Take the Lead ". "Save the 
Last Dance", "Center Stage", and every oth- 
er dance movie before it, is the story of two 
young people from opposite sides of the 
tracks thai are brought together by danc- 
ing. Noratfenna Dewan) is a ballet student 
at the prestigious Maryland School of the 
Arts and lyler (( harming latum) is a rebel 
without hope, lyler and his friends make 



:, Tyler gets 200 hours of 
community service at the scene of the crime. 
Nora's having a rough lime of life, too. Her 
future's on the line when her dance partner 
gets hurt and has to pull out of her piece 
for the famed kill Senior Showcase. As fate 
would have it, though, our favorite delin- 
quent is quite the break dancer Naturally, 
Nora and Tyler are drawn to each other, both 
artistically and physically. (I think I actually 
heard birdies chirping and saw little bun- 
nies dancing, it was that sweet.) Blah! Blah! 
Blah! I don't even have to tell you anymore; 
if you've seen any of the aforementioned 
films, you can figure out what happens in 
this one. 

My friend and I spent half the time mak- 
ing fun of it and the other half dancing in 
our seats like idiots ... well, I did at least. 
The writing, acting, plot, just about every- 
thing else was putrid. The only thing that 
wasn't too bad was the dancing and the 
soundtrack. But even that wasn't fabulous. 
I mean, I loved Dewan in "Take the Lead", 
but I was seriously let down when she had 
more than four lines. The girl can dance, 
don't get me wrong. She's amazing, but she 
really shouldn't talk. But. hey, I shouldn't 
be so judgmental. She is in "The Grudge 
2" and I'll probably go see that. And. if she 
does another dance flick — which I suspect 
she will — I'll go see that, too. 

Tatum was so-so at best. He didn't do 
anything really to excite me. His dancing 
was alright, but definitely not spectacular. 
There were better dancers on this season's 
"So You Think You Can Dance". His acting 
surely didn't blow me away; in fact, it was 
laughable. Basically, 1 think he was hired to 
be a pretty base for Dewan's lifts. 

When push comes to shove, I won't see it 
again, nor will I purchase it. There are far 
better dance flicks out there— and that's 
not saying much. If you really want to see 
Dewan in action, rent "Take the Lead.'' Her 
salsa at the end of that is much better than 
anything she does in "Step Up".

Snakes on a Plane Give 
B Movies a Good Name 



By Tiffany Dirig 



Overall Rating = 2 Stars 



When the cinema lights 
dimmed and a Hawaiian 
beach came into view, I 
was more than a little con- 
fused. At first. 1 thought 
that I'd somehow been 
sucked into Dante's 7th 
layer of" Hell and was go- 
ing to be forced to watch 
"Speed 2" for all eternity. 
Then, just.as abruptly as 1 
thought 1 might have made 
a drastic error somewhere 
during my path on this 
planet, I realized it was just 
the beginning of an equally 
painful film: "Snakes on a 
Plane" (a.k.a. "SoaP"). 

Yep, you read me cor- 
rectly. I went to see quite 
possibly the worst B-flick 
ever concocted. "SoaP" 
was so bad; in fact, it's an 
insult to call it a B-fiick 
at all. All that being said, 
however, I haven't had 
such a good time at the 
movies since "Final Des- 
tination 3"!!! "SoaP" was 
a better caricature of hor- 
ror flicks than the "Scary 
Movie" franchise in its en- 
tirety. 

The plot is so simple a 
baboon could've come up 
with it— actually, it prob- 
ably was a baboon. A 
dude named Sean (Nathan 
Phillips) sees a gruesome, 
cold-hearted murder and 
then becomes the object 
of the murderer's ... affec- 
tion. Enter the quintessen- 
tial butt-kicker himself, 
Samuel L. Jackson. Sam 
saves the guy's life and 
convinces him to testify 



against the blood-thirsty 
mobster. Yada ! Yada ! 
Yada! Venomous snakes 
are released on the big ole 
plane that's taking Sean to 
LA so he can testify. The 
rest of the movie is a lot of 
sex (the producers actu- 
ally added more to bump 
the PG-13 rating up to an 
R— classy, eh?), snakes, 
and gun shots. What more 
does one need for a gory 
pseudo-horror/action mov- 
ie? Not too much. 

"SoaP" was so bad that 
1 spent 98% of it doubled- 
over in fits of hysterical 
laughter. The first couple 
to bite it (oh, the pun is 
totally intended) is two 
young lovers. They're 
in the bathroom for some 
smoking' and ... ah, lov- 
ing' ... when the snakes 
decide they're hungry. It 
just rolls downhill from 
there. Collectively. I 
think every body part was 
bitten in the movie at least 
once — and 1 do mean ev- 
ery body part (ouch). 

I think the best part of 
this movie was how every 
nanosecond was filled to 
capacity with every trite 
cliche in the book. From 
the hypersexual couple to 
kick the bucket first to the 
wanton flight attendant 
named Tiffany (the irony 
wasn't lost on me) to Sam 
shacking up with Nurse 
Hathaway ... oops, 1 mean 
Julianna Marguiles ... to 
the cheesy pop/punk/rap/ 
rock music video at the 
end, every frame of this 
movie was as predicable 
as it was campy. 

Speaking of the mu- 
sic video, let's talk about 
that for a second. Cobra 



Starship— which is com- 
prised of members from 
Midtown (Gabe Saporta), 
Gym Classic Heroes 
(Travis McCoy), The 
Academy Is ...(William 
Beckett), and The Sounds 
(Majalvarsson)— came 
together to make this 
abomination in music's 
clothing. I suppose that's 
a little harsh. The beat 
isn't too bad, nor is the 
vocals; but the words are 
atrocious. "Oh, I'm ready 
for it" is the hook. Wow. 
I'm floored by the com- 
plexity. Gabe looks like 
an Adam Levine wanna- 
be. Poor Travis is trying 
so hard to channel Jack 
White, it's sad. William 
is a carbon copy of Will. 
I.Am from the Black 
Eyed Peas. While Maja is 
like a clone of Fergie and 
Nelly Furtado. It was a 
very entertaining way to 
cap off a very entertaining 
film. 

Here's the down and 
dirty of it, folks. If you 
go see "SoaP", do not 
pay full price, but do see 
it in the theatre. (Thank 
goodness for the buck 
theatre, right!?) Don't go 
in expecting your life to 
be forever altered by the 
flick; go in knowing that 
it's going to be two hours 
of raucous fun. I mean, 
when the most memorable 
line from the movie has 
Sam spewing expletives, 
you know it's a good 
time!! (Side note: if you 
don't know what line 
I'm talking about, go to 
YouTube.com and look up 
"snakes on a plane music 
video". Your questions 
will be answered.)

Seventh Annual Soccer Showcase 



By Jenna Tompkins 
and Kira Schowe 



Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! 1PFW hosted the seventh annual 
soccer showcase the Hefner Soccer Field Thursday August 1 7 
thru Sunday August 20. Twelve universities were represented 
at this event, including both the men and women's teams from 
IPFW. The two teams ended the Showcase in a tie. With the 
final score for the men's being till against Marquette and the 
ladies tied 1-1 battling Toledo. 

Terry Stefankiewicz, the head coach for both of IPFW's 
teams, felt that the soccer showcase "...went really well. We 
may change our format and bring the teams in for two games 
instead of one. It gives a better feel." As of now. the teams are 
playing only one game and then leaving. 

The men are very young and are using freshman to fill the 
shoes of the seniors that were lost. Stefankiewicz feels the 
guys need to "...focus on combinations that work and pays 
dividends. 

The main focus for the women's team is this year's con- 
ference. "The women's team veterans played conference last 
year and they are expecting to win," said Stefankiewicz. 

Even though that both teams tied Stefankiewicz says, "the 
potential of winning is there... Playing for the first time you 
never know what to expect." 

Stefankiwicz states that the strengths for the men's teams 
are "'Chas Parry [rum Lngland i- .i premiere goal scorer. Ben
