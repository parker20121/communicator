Day Care Center policy wrong 



■ „ _.~.i when the situation demands it. 

Glada Landis has demonstrated this courage. She has gone public and for a 
very good reason. She is not grinding an axe; ajtis genuinely concerned about the 
children she has been serving the past three years. 

Glada Landis has been asked to take an indefinite leave of absence without pay 
because of her efforts to correct what is wrong in the child care center. There is 
certainly something wrong in the center. Five teachers, both present staff 
members and former staffers, have expressed dissatisfaction with the center's 
management Two former head teachers have resigned out of frustration and a 
third teacher charges she was fired for criticising center policies. 

The Communicator has also received reports of parents who have pulled their 
children out of the child care center because of the way it was being run Something 
is very wrong, and no amount of off-hand denials by certain present staffers will 
hide thai (act . These same criticisms have been r

ROTC, alternatives needed 

The Purdue faculty senate is currently debating whether or not IPFW should 
offer the convenience of ROTC on campus. Some seem to oppose the addition of this 
program, saying that "it will only breed another war." 

Actually, Hf vn (..in lie ni preal economic help to students that would otherwise 
be unable lo. 'iff "I'd. i higher education. And of course, It does give people that would 
have joined I he armed services anyway a chance to better their education before 
enlisting. 

The proposal the university is currently considering does not give any financial 
support to the R&lt; &gt;TC program That is probably the way it should be, and before the 
university docs contemplate financial support of the program, it should also 
investigate alternative means of supplying IPFW students with financial incomes 
parallel to ROTC benefits and a guaranteed job upon graduation, 

If the university ever decides to support ROTC financially, it seems only fair 



Break change practical 

Both faculty senates have approved a date change for the upcoming spring 
break. With the change, IPFW's spring break will coincide with the Fort Wayne 
Communily .Schools' spring break, something that is very important to students 
and staff that have children in school. 

Approximately 50 percent of students at IPFW are married, many who have 
children. These students, not to mention the faculty and staff with children, should 
have the right to be will) their children during the spring vacation. 

Students' Government has argued that the change will bring havoc to those 
sfudents that have made commitments for the spring break. Although this 
argument is valid, those students do have time to make adjustments in their plans. 

The faculty senate did consider the student government argument, but the 
faculty's' decision is the mosl practical one, and hopefully, the chancellor will 
endorse it.

60% of BOSE Owners 
Changed Our Mind 



While we enjoy talking about the technology that 
distinguishes the BOSE 901, and about the 
unprecedented series of rave reviews by leading 
critics, the purpose of an advertisement is to 
increase sales by introducing more people to the 
product. 

A surprising result of a customer survey changed 
our mind as to the most effective use of 
advertising funds. It revealed that 60 percent of 
the people who select the BOSE 901 do so at the 
recommendation of a 901 owner ! This told us that 
the best advertisement is the product, and the 
best salesman is the. enthusiastic owner. 



We concluded that an excellent use of advertising 
funds would be to help set up an absolutely 
phenomenal music system in as many owners' 
homes as possible. Known as the SUPER BOSE 
SYSTEM, it consists of the 1801 power amplifier 
and two pairs of 901 speakers. One pair of 901s is 
placed to reflect sound off a front wall, and the 
second pair reflects off side walls, producing 
sound with spatial realism and presence that is 
simply astounding. 




-BOSk 



Our program in setting up these systems in 
owners' homes is to provide the SECOND PAIR 
OF 901s FREE to all those serious enough to 
purchase a component system consisting of the 
1801 amplifier and a pair of 901s. We have 
allocated sufficient advertising funds to cover all 
purchases made from October 15, 1975 to January 
15, 1976. 

We believe that the SUPER BOSE SYSTEM is 
the best music system available today.
