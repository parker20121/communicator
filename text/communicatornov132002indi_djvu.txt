Sarratore. assistant vice

mystic who was accepted as the 
messiah by most of the Jewish

ol followers. He attempted to 



land in Constantinople, was

the movement that he created, 
known as the Sabbatean move- 
ment, survived for many years, 
mamtaining secret followers up

Students will have option to recycle 

Coke, students team to recycle plastic bottles 



Have you ever felt a twinge 
of guilt while you were throw- 
ing away your soda bottles? 
TharJcs to a shident recycling 
organization, campus-goers 
now have the option to do some- 
thing else with Iheir empty 
drink battles. 

PRO Recycling is a student- 
run non-profit orgaruzalion ded- 
icated to making recycling easy 
and accessible, as well as educat- 
ing the public about community 
slewandship. 

Begirming Monday, Nov, 
17. there will be recycling bins 
located at various points on 
campus. Twenty bins were 
donated by Ihe Coca Cola 
Bottling Company here m Fori 
Wayne to facilitate Ihe opportu- 



as well as outside build- 
ings and parking lots. Each week 
the bins will be emptied and 
taken lo a recycling center. PRO 
Recycling hopes that by the end 



I of the year each clas 



for plaslic bottles. 

Volunteers are needed to 
assist in this effort. Each of the 
building bins will need to be 
emptied lo an outside bin. PRO 
Recycling is looking for teacher 
volunleets to send a student to 
empty the trash in each ctass- 
loom to a bin on each floor. Each 
floor will then need lo be emp- 
tied lo a bin outside each building. 

Sophomore engineering 
student Melanie McKinley, who 
founded the non-profit organi- 
zation says. "Well, if you are like 
most of us, you feel angry that a 
few rich and powerful compa- 
nies are deciding our environ- 
mental future. Contaminated 
water supplies threaten lo leave 
us all scrambling for water. 
Global warming threatens lo 
change our climate dramatically 
over the next decade, affecting

From the Left: 
Election 2002 

By Penny Tsiguloff 



Mars Asks, 



Well we h.ive il RcpubNcan 
conlrol ot I he presidency, of Ihc 
Hoiiw .ind of Ihc Senale, The 
last lime Ihat Ihe Republicans 
conltollcd the While House and 
the Congress was in Ihe 1950s, 
and Ihe president was Dwighl 
Eiscnliowcr. 

What does il mean to have 
the While House, Ihe Congress 
and Ihe Senale completely con- 
trolled by our Commander in 
Chief George W. Bush? Well, 
lei's look al Ihe last two years in 
perspeclive. 

We have an election system 
thill is greatly flawed, and we 
have 3 man in power as the pres- 
ident of the United States who 
gained power, in an election Ihat 
was too close to call, by Ihe elec- 
loial votes of Florid.i — Ihc stale 
in which his brother is acting

Jeb Bush pronounced winners in 
his slate, savin)- that all the

thai there were still over 100,000 
votes Ihat were not yet counted. 
We have a prcsidcnl who was

lurt, despite majority vote.

Corporate America, big bus

In I 



what 



all this mean t 
American people? Well, in the 
words of Bill Moycrs, "If you 
like God in government, get 
ready (or the rapture. These 
(oIIj don't even mind you refer- 
ring to the GOP as Ihe party of 
God. Why else would the new 
House majority leader say that 
Ihe almighty is using him lo pro- 
mote 'a biblical worldview' in 
American poll lies?" 

In the lasl two years, Ihc 
global gag rule, originally insti- 
tuted by Reagan, has been rcin- 
stitutcd, banning any lunding to 
any otginizalioiw that perform 
pro-choice services. 

Congressional laws Ihat 
protected the rights of over 40 
million disabled Americans 
have been overturned, as have 
safety regulations designed to 
protect American workers from 
work-related injuries. There haf 
been dramalie cuts in govern- 
ment aid lo \o\v income recipi- 
ents, including cuts to childeare 
programs. 

In polls arotind the country, 
Ihc number one concern of the 
majority of American people has 
been Ihe economy. Guess ivhat? 
It isn't going to gel any betler, at 
least not any tune soon. 

Presidcnl Bush has not 
made a single commilmeni to 
create more jobs ot restore con- 
sumer confidence. Bush has 
repeatedly put tlie interests of 
corporate America above the 
interests ol the people. 

Unemployment is high, 
interest rales are low and jobs 
ate scarce. I personally know 
several well-trained individuals 
who have been rigorously job 
hunting for the past nine 
months and cannot find a job. It 
is only going to gel 



poralions like MBNA, chemical 
companies and the big winners, 
(drum roll please), the oil and 
energy companies. 

Lei's (ace ilT we have a pres- 
ident who has a history of com- 
mitment to big business. His 
father is an oil man. Where did 
the Bush (amily money come 
from? And there is new evidence 
that connects President Bush 
wilh insider trading at Harkcn 
energy, information Ihat the 
media, the judicial branch and 
Ihe Amencan people are ignoring. 

Now let's look al the envi- 
ronmental issues. Il has only 
been Ihe stringent efforts ot the 
Democrflls that have stopped 
our president from drilling for 
oil in Alaska and from passinR 
new regulations (or deforesta- 
tion, allowing logging on public 
land, ivildemcss preserves and 
national forests. 

The Republican agenda h 



restrictions on the amount ot 
arsenic in drinking water and 
building roads in pristine areas. 
What about offshore 
drilling? Well, look out 
California, here it comes. All of 
the issues that ihe Democrats 
have blocked in the last two 
years are going lo come back lo 

And last but not least, lefs 
look at our political agenda.

We had been negotiating 
with the Tahban for some lime 
about running a pipeline 
through Afghanislan to gel to 
the Caspian oil fields. Well, we 
can do that noiv. And what did il 
cost? Only human life. 

If we want control of more 
oil, let's look to Iraq, 1 am sure 
that unilateral control will give 
our power-hungry president all 
the latitude that he needs lo take 
control of as much of the world

Since we're on Ihe subject, 
let's not forget about our new

Just an interesting fact. 

Our government has been 
putting looether a list ot all the 
people who are a potential 
threat. It includes anyone who 
challenges the new American 
order I am sure that I am well 
on my way lo making Ihc list,

Mars Asks; High school 
athletics has seen a change in the 
pasl several years There are no 
longer any exclusively male 
sports. In some places around 
the country, the policies of some 
schools have been challenged by 
girls who wish lo play a sport 
Ihat was only available 10 boys, 
and Ihesc girls have won. So. 
now there are female memticrs 
of high school athletic teams in 
sporls such as wrestling and 
football. Sounds fair doesn't il? 
Not really It seems lo me that 
this has opened a whole new can 
of worms Ihat could have conse- 
quences (or female athletes. 

The reason that this bothers 
me is that il females arc allowed 
to play on the football learn, are 
males going 10 be allowed on the 
high school volleyball team? 
Fair's fair, right? Are we even 
going lo have mole and female 
sporls teams, or should we just 
integralc them and let the besi 
players play, regardless of gender? 
1 remember when 1 was in 
the eighth eradc some of my 
buddies and I went to the meet- 
ing for Ihc "people" interested in 
playing volleyball (of course wc 
were |usl being brally teenagers) 



and i^-ere praclicalty thrown out 
ol the auditorium! 1 guess they 
meant the meeting was for the 
girls inlerested in playing voUeyball! 
My intention is not to criticize 
anyone for breaking down any 
walls or for challenging Ihe rules 



sequences when deciding lo do 
so. I Ihink that it's wonderful 
that girls are being allowed to 
play .sports thai were previously 
off limits as long as boys are 
granted the same opportunity. 

Venus Responds: As far as 
all of this goes, 1 agree Ihat 
things have been changing rap- 
idly in the pasl few years. Girls 
are now more integrated into the 
previously all male sporting 
events while guys arc still limit- 
ed as to the events m which they 
are allowed to participate. 

Fair? No, not really, but nel- 
Iher was the fad that women 
weren't allowed lo vole, work, or 
read for many years! Things 
change with lime and wilh force. 
Things can't change unless 
someone stands up and chal- 
lenges Ihe "norms" as Mars 
mcnlioned. 

Unfortunately, it seems that 
for Ihe most part, women are the 
ones standing up to society's (in 
this case, athletic) norms and 




forcing modifications 

I can't say that I fully 
agree with girls in foolball pads, 
but it they think they can hack it, 
then so be it. Al the same time, I 
think Ihat there are many sports, 
checrlcading for example, (yes, it 
is a sport!) in which guys would 
be at a loss for latent just k girls 
would be in football or 
wrestling. 



Ma\ 



e for g 



and guys to slop trying to differ- 
entiate sporting events and other 
"titled" activities. Either way, 
there are going to be things Ihat 
guys are just betler at than girls, 






...thcr 






make things exclusively (or girls 
ot guys onlv. Times are a 
changin' my friend! Good luck 
trying to cope! 



Election Results: 

Republicans take leadership in government 



Hello ag,iin from the con- 
servative righl. Well, as you 
know, the COP did well in the 
recent elections. The government 
is once again united under 
Republican leadership for only 
the second time in flO years- The 
Democrats have been swift to 
blame the popularity of 9/11 on 

This is not only foolish but bor- 
ders on Ihc absurd. 

The terrorists (here I go 
again) didn't attack the GOP or 
the Democrats, they attacked 
America. It is obviously an 
excuse made by the Democratic 
Party for their failure to maintain 
control of Ihe House or win con- 
lrol of the Senate. 

The Democrats' ineffective- 
ness in this election hinged upon 
several things. Mainly il was 
because of Ihc lack of universal, 
parly-ivide policy i 



The president did it so it must be 
okay for the rest of us?

'Animal House' homecoming movie review 



n hU 



With J candcKcnding look 
lycs, Dtan Wornlet pro- 



claims, Fal, dnink and stupid is 
no way lo go through Wie, son," 

Maybe it's not the message 
[PFW is trying lo gel across (or 
ihc 2002 HomKotning week, bul 
it (its m jusi fine. When SAB, 
IPFW Alhlelics and alumni 
began discussions for Ihe 
Homecoming theme, who would 
have ever imagined Ihat it would 
turn oul to be what it is. Alter 
much consid era lion. Ihc decision 
was mnde I ha M he theme would 
be "Animal House." A lakeoll of 
Ihc 1978 John Undis film. Ihis 
Ihcme was wide open for nearly 
any activity lo be Held. 

"Actually, it's a pcctly good 
slory Ihow Ihe theme was decid- 
ed]," said Alhlelic Director Mark 
Pope, "This year, we thought 11 
would make sense lo try lobuild 
Homecoming around one single 
theme — something that both 
students and alums could identi- 
fy with," 

As the athletic department. 
SAO and alumni were talking, 
they all threw out ideas pertain- 
ing to what they thought IPFW 
was rcjily about. The group 
wanted lo nelp dispel the stigma 
of being referred to as a "com* 
muler campus" and be consid- 
ered as traditional unlvcrsily. 
So in tum, they looked for a 
theme Ihat would do thai. 

Someone in the group came 
up with the idea lo do a movie 
theme, 

"Wc wanted to think about 
a real college Ihemc, and what is 



the gteatcsl college movie ever 
made? Why, "Animal House." of 
course," Pope said. 

At that point, the Iheme was 
decided, Bul after picking the 
Ihcme, Ihe committee had to 
come up wilh ideas about how to 
incorporate Ihe theme Ihroueh 
daily activities. Since the 
Homecoming Dance was popu- 
lar last year. Ihe committee want- 
ed lo do something like thai 
agam. So Ihey came up with the 
idea that Ihcy could have Ihe 
original band Irom Ihe movie 
play. 

"Lo and behold, Oils Day 
and the Knights were still 
around, and were available on 
Nov. 22," Pope said, "We knew 
that we had a winning theme." 

The idea for Ihe movie 
"Animal House " was the brain- 
child of writers Harold RamLs 
("Choslbuslen"), Douglas Kenney 
("Caddyshack") and Chris 
••■"-- ("Multiplicity"). Passed 



■rbysc 






/ersal Pictures was 
quick lo pick up the film. 

Highlighted with what by 
today's standanls would be a 
blockbuster cast, "Animal 
House" was sel as a comcdic film 
about a fraternity called Delta 
Tau Chi on the campus of Faber 
College. The movie was sel in 
1962. Wilh a loiv budget, the 
movie's writers, producers and 
director were forced lo find a 
cast of virtually unknowns. 



Howi 



e Ihe n 



release 24 years ago, many mem- 
bers of the cast have gone on lo 
become some of Ihc most 
cespecled actors in Hollyivood 
today. But, before Ihcy could 



even worry about Ihc unknowns, 
Lindis knew that they needed al 
least one big name to grab the 
viewers' altvniion. Enlt'r |ohn 
Belu.'ihi ( "DIucs BroLhcrs")- 

himscli, Belushi was beeinning 
lo establish a cult-like following 
due lo his stint on "Saturday 
Night Live." 

As Ihe casting process was 
in Ihe infant stages, Landis knew 
right away that Belushi was right 
for the pail of John "Blulo" 
Blularski. The character was a 
hungiy, common sense, drunk, 
nol-alf-there-in-lhe-head type ol 
guy, and Belushi was [ust the 
man for Ihc job. 

The casting directors then 
had their work cut oul (or them. 
A cast of near nobodies was soon 
brought in to complcle the main 
characters. Tom Hulce ("The 
Hunchback of Notre Dame") 
was given Ihc spot ol one of Ihe 
main characlers, Larry "I'inio" 
Kroger. Pinto was Ihe somewhat 
shy member ol Ihe clan, who, 
along wilh his best Iriend Kent 
Dorlman, were new pledges into 
the ' - " ' 



initiation inio Delta 
Dorlman is given Ihc Delta name 
of 'Flounder by Blulo " 

Lmdis Ihcn cast a newcom- 
er named Kevin Bacon ("Wild 
Things," "Hollow. Man") to play 
Chip Diller, a new pledge for Ihe 
rival Omega Iralemity. "Animal 
House" was Bacon's first movie 
rote, and since then he has gone 
on lo star in 53 other lilms. 

Continuing lo cast the so- 
c.illcd "bad guys" ol the lilm, 



Landis cast Mark Melcall 
("Drive Me Crazy") lo play Ihe 
drill sergeanl-esque Doug 
Neidcrmeycr. James Doughton 
("Sorority Boys") was cast as 
Greg Marmalard, the head of Ihc 
Omega House. Bul the easiest 
villain to cast was m Ihe part of 
Dean Vernon Wormcr For this 

fart. Landis called in his old 
■lend Jon Vernon ("Airplane II," 
"Swiss Family Robinson") lo 
play Ihe part of the uptight dean 
ol siudenUs who was not so oil 
from his own personality. 

Finally, the final key mem- 
bers of Ihc Delta Hou.'ic were 
cast, Tim Malhcson ("A Very 
Brady Sequel") was cast into the 
part of Eric "Otter" Siralton. the 
Delta ladies man. Peter Ricgerl 
("The Mask") was cast as Otter's 
right hand man. Donald "Boon" 
Scnocnslein. James Widdoes 
("Charles in Charge") got Ihe Job 
ol Robert floover. Ihe president 
ol Delia, and Bruce McGill (" 
Legend of Bagger Vance") was 
cast as Ihe hard-nosed Daniel 
Simpson "D-Day" Day. 

Wilh each actor playing a 
character ol their own. "Animal 
House" helped build the careers 
of dozens ol young and aspiring 
actors. Some ol Ihe actors, tike 
Widdoes have gone on to direct 

In addition lo launching Ihe 
careers of Ihe main characters, 
the movie also launched Ihe 
career ol DcWayne Jessie. As a 
relatively unknown actor, Jessie 
was thrust into a spollight in Ihe 
- - - ' -s ol all pl.ii- - ■ -

Ranting Redskin 



e I'n 
„ nE to bash jnv part: 
athlete 

my convenlional column where I 
weich in on Ihe sports world, I 
mighl nol gamer rave reviews 
from anyone who reads it, but 
il's whal I have lo say. 

This lopic has t&gt;ecn on my 
mind for almost a year noiv and 
finally 1 have a proper forum lo 



tradition of how Ihe Yankees 
seem Lo rule baseball, I'm talking 
alroul a more deeply seeded tra- 
dition. And granted. Ihls hap- 
pens ail across the country, bul 
I'm going to focus in on my high 
school as a specific example. 

What exactly is offensive? 
My alma mater has carried the 
nickname Redskins (or 75 years 
noiv, bul it seems thai people 
have only recently l&gt;egun io take 
offense I o this name. 

So what does Ihe adminis- 
tralion want to do? They want lo 
change Ihe name. I hear thai sev- 
eral ideas have been tossed 
around, including calling sports 
learns Ihe Nottli Side Pride. 



VVh.il 

1 understand Ihe hutory of 
the name, thai Ihe while man gave 
the name lo Native Americans as a 
derogatory lerm, 1 know Ihat in 
the past 400 years the term was as 
laboo lo some people as today's 
common racial slurs. 

But the people who now 
challenge the name Redskins 
seem lo be unable lo look deeper 
than Ihe name ilself. At North 
Side. Ihe name Redskiru was not 
looked at as a slur. To many 
including myself, the name was 
a symbol ol pride. I didn't play 
any sports, 1 was not involved in 
many aclivilies and I often 
mocked my school, bul I was 
proud lo be a Redskin. I still am. 

Is il nghl thai my ancestors 
pegged Native Americans wilh 
this name thai at one point was a 
sligma? Aljsolutely not. But in 
this case, Ihere is no longer a 
sligma attached. Mayt&gt;e in some 
cases Ihere is, bul nol here. There 
are over a dozen schools in the 
Fort Wayne area. We have 
Hawks, Cadets, Chargers, Archers, 
Knights, Saints and so on, but 
not one of those names conveys 
the same pride that Redskin 

Maybe to an alumnus ol 
Bishop Dwenger, l&gt;eing consid- 
ered a Saint is a reason lo be 
Eroud, but it's not lo me. So |ust 
Bcause some people don't see 
pride m the term Redskin, we 
should take il away? TTien let's 
lake jiv.iy all ot the other names, 
loo. 1 don't see any pride in 



Archer, so why nol lake thai aivay? 
The saddest part is that Ihe 
people who push for Ihe Redskin 
name lo be dropped are the 
...!_;._ -niddie-dass 



o probably attended 
me upper-class private school, 
ost of the people who want to 



Nalivi 

them didn't even attend Ihe 
school Ihcy arc pushing lo change. 
Does thai seem right? Do 1 
go down to Hunlinelon North 
and say that 1 lind the Vikings' 
name demeaning and demand 
that il l)e changed? No. Why 
should anyone gel lo decide 
what North Side should be 
called other than Ihose it affects 
the mosli the alumni, stall and 

Obviously, high schools, 
especially mine, are the smallesl 
o( the scales on which this is hap- 
perung. Major League Baseball 
has the Braves and Ihe Indians; 
the NHL has the Blackhawks; 
Ihe NBA has the Warriors and 
the NFL has Ihe Redskins. 

All of Ihose names hover 
under the Ihreat of some do- 

SDoder's complaint- Other than 
le NFL's WasTiinglon Redskins, 
none of those names even has 
the slighlesl bil of slander 
involved.

IPFW hangs on to beat Olivet 



^ Although it was an (■■inbi- 

tion game and the Mas(ihi.r. 
won. IPFW men's ba.'.k.-il , 
coach Doug Noll was still \\y~t.\ 
wilh his team. 

■The Dons held a 12-pinnt 
advantage over Olivet College .it 
halflimcbut IPFW managed iu,-t 
a four-poini victory over Ihc 
Comets, 9(V^. 

"I'm really disappointed 
now in the second ttali and Ihc 
way we're approaching Ihings,' 
Moll said, "This team out-scored 
us in Ihe second half. I'm vcr&gt;- 
disappointed with our intensity 
and with our leadership." 

What Noll was most disap- 
pointed with was his Icam's 
elforl. or lack thereof. 

-What we can't do right 
now is think that when we show 
up on the floor, no matter who 
we're playing, we can turn on 
and olf Ihe light switch whenev- 
er we want." Noll said. "I'd 
rather lo=e wilh our t&gt;cst effort 
than win with a lousy effort any 
day of the week, because it's 
about making that effort, and 



scoring attack to earn Ihe win 
wilh five players scoring in dou- 
ble-figures. 

"We know wc can play 
offense. Night in and night out, 1 
think we can score, but we're 
going lo have lo lake care of the 
basketball a little belter," Noll 
said. "[Our problems are] all on 
the defensive end. If we don't 
defend and rebound, we won't 
win a game this year." 

IPFW was led by Terry 
CoUiru with 16 poinis, while Ric 
Wyand finished wilh 15 poinis 
and seven rebounds, David 
Simon and Jim Kessenich had 13 
points apiece along wilh eight 
and seven boards, respectively. 
DeAngelo Woodall added 11 
points, six rebounds, four assists 
and Ihree steals, while Jeremy 
King chipped in nine points. 

"I Ihoughl Jim Kessenich 

;d belter than he did in our 
vhibition game," Noll said: 
has ticcn consistent, but 




IPFW's Jeremy King (0) drives to the basket as Olivet's 
Patrick Dermeyer (24) goes for the block. The Dons 
held off the Comets for a 90-86 victory Sunday. 

he's got to gel more physical on 
the defensive end. We're dealing 
wilh a lot of youth and inciperi- 



te 



■c Irying." 

The Dons never trailed 
throughout the contest and led 
by as many as 15 poinis, 

IPFWhold a 53-39 advan- 
tage carlv in Ihc second half af ler 
a layup by Kessenich with 17:42 
on the clock. 

Two baskets by Olivet's 
Steve Johnson and a free throw 
by Michael Dyson trimmed Ihc 
Mastodoi\s' lead lo smgle digits 
at 53-44. A layup by Simon 
stretched Ihe Dons lead back lo 
11 poinis, but a jumper and a 
layup by Dyson pulled the 
Comets wittun seven. 

The IPFW lead wavered 
between seven and 13 poinis 
until a pair of free throws by 



seconds to play. 

In the closing seconds, 
layups by Olivet's Will Lee were 
countered with free throws by 
Brad Noll and Collins to pre- 
serve the victory for the EJons, 

With Sunday's game being 
IPFW's (inal ediibition contest. 
Coach Noll docs nol enpecl the 
competition to lighten up once 
the regular season starts, 

'This season is going to be 
very difficult for us," he said. 
"We're going lo have to play at 
our highest level of intensity and 
toughness just lo survive, and 
that may not be good enough." 

IPFW will travel lo

compete In the Black Coaches

Falling into fashion 



Are you textile chal- 
lenged? Do you put hori- 
zontal and vertical striped 
items together? Is your 
idea of "accessorizing" 
wearing socks? If so, please 
read on. Actually, every- 
body read on. It is not only 
interesting, but helpful. 

During the next several 

Karagrapns or so, vjb will 
e discussing men's fash- 
ion for fall and winter of 
2002-2003. There are some 
exciting new changes and 
some not-5o-ex citing ones. 
Don't worry, guys. You 
won't be needmg to throw 
away all of your jeans, t- 
shirts and camp shirts. 
They are still in. !n fact, 
denim and cotton will 
probably be around until 
(he end of time. 

Your jeans can be 
upgraded, however, to 



"whiskered" jeans. Jeans 
with the horizontal white 
stress marks above the legs, 
previously reserved lor 
women, are now coming in 
men's styles. 

You will also see a 
much bigger selection of 
rugby shirts with the fat 
stripes and the white col- 
lars that Old Navy started 
with their Brady Bunch 
knockoff commercials, 
"The Rugby Bunch." 

Can you guess what 
other article of clothing 
came back? I'll give vou a 
hint: Ziiip... Ziiip... Ziiip... 
Give upr Corduroys! That 
is the sound they make as 
your legs brush together 
while walking. These are 
very exciting for me, I 
enjoy my cords very much. 

Sweater-wise, guys, I'm 
afraid I don't have much to 
report. Funnel neck 
sweaters are those with col- 
lars that look like mock 




ular look for males this season. 



?ho\Q b\i Eugene Mnrding, Photo Editor 
ivhiskered jeans will be a pop- 



turtlenecks with the ends 
rolled down. 

Luckily, though, fleece 
zip pullovers are widely 
available. These will keep 
you toasty warm through 
the evil midwest winter 
months. Wear them over 
turtleneck shirts for maxi- 
mum neck coverage. 

Now I will move on to 
slightly more formal 
clothes. High-fashion 
chances much faster than 
casual clothes, so it might 
get a little complicated 
here. Bear with me. 

Over all, the color 
schemes you will be seeing 
the most will be the eartn 
tones once popular in the 
'70s: browns, khakis, 
olives, drabs, maroons and 
creams. Orange hasn't hit it 



future if this retro trend 
continues. 

Sadly for me, blues are 
not at their peak as they 
were two or three years 
ago. On the bright side, the 
blue that is popular is the 
bright roval blue. Examples 
can be found at Structure 
or Bachrach. Mock necks, 
especially ribbed-patterned, 
are popular under sport 
coats or suits. 

For a more dress casual 
look, you can fmd interest- 
ingly patterned silk or 
rayon sports shirts to wear 
with dress pants. 

Another very attractive 
shirt to wear with nice 
pants are patterned with 
what I fondly call a "tech- 
ni colored barcode." 

These shirts have verti- 
cal stripes in varying thick- 
nesses and varying but 
coordinating color schemes. 

One very exciting thing 
for me that is shirt related: 
French-cuffs are back in! f 
can continue to show off 
■ my cufflinks with pride! 
You can also find many 
dress shirts in a blue or 
striped pattern with con- 
trasting white cuffs and 
collars Tor that banker look. 

Collars are running 
wider this year, all set for a 
necktie tied in a larger 
windsor-knot. This is a per- 
fect segue into my next 
topic ^ ties. 

Remember the Regis 
look with the metallic ties 
matching the color of the 



shirts? Although they are 
still fashionable, their" pop- 
ularity is waning. Look for 
ihemiobeout by next year. 
Poor Regis. (Although he 
did replace Kathi Lee with 
Kelly Ripa — that was a 
smart move). 

Ties are going back to 
the conservative side with 
patterns of geometric 
shapes or horizontal 
stripes. Iridescent ties are 
slowly rising in popularity 
as well. 

Suit-wise, you may see 
the retro look taken back 
further into the '40s with 
the classic black pinstriped 
suit. However, a suit in the 
earth tones I mentioned 
earlier are equally stylish. 

Good news for all you 
tall guys out there — suit 
jackets are still being cut 
higher with three and four 
buttons so you don't have 
that lone gap that your tie 
has to fill down the front. 

For when you are out- 
doors and still want to be 
fashionable, buy a pea coat. 
Whether you want single- 
breasted or double-breast- 
ed, the choice is up to you. 

From my observations, 
the best double-breasted 
pea coats are at Old Navy 
and The Gap, and the best 
single-breasted are at J. 
Crew. 

If you are planning to 
buy some new shoes, you 
should definitely consider 
square-toe shoes. 

They are comfortable, 
providing ample room for 
your toes. Something with 
a thick sole will also be 
good, providing good trac- 
tion on the ice and elevat- 
ing your feet from slush 
and snow. 

Some other possible 
trends peeking their heads 
around the corner: Is it just 
me, or do I see tweed quite 
a bit more?
