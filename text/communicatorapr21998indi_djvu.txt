Newly-elected leaders present agenda 



By Gail Ruble Crawford 
News Editor 



Studcnl righls and increased 
sludenl campus involvcmeul arc ibe 
l(^ ilems on Ihc agenda for the 
ncwly-elccied leaders of IPSGA, 

The winners of the elections 
will begin tbeir terms with the sian 
of the first summer session, 

"We want the studenu. to be able 
:to speak ouL We've seen that the 
faculty have been able to speak out 
wilb tbeir concerns. We want the 
students lo be able lo do that as 
wcU," said Shawn Hcit, prtsidenl- 
elccl. 

Heil said the new leaders want 
lo make the IPFW environment con- 
ducive to its students, not jusi 10 ihc 
faculty or to the administration 



"I'm wanting lo remind this 
campus Ihal students come first," 



Heil said 
the new officers 
are eager lo gel 
started in iheir 
new positions 
and have an 
agenda thai 
promotes stu- 
dent activities 
and organiza- 
tions. 

"1 would 
like lo help stu- 
dent organiza- 
lions so ihai 
ihey can reiiim 
more 10 the siu-

Heit 



dents." Heil said. 

She plans to push for increased 
campus offerings that appeal to a 
wider group of students. 

By doing this, she said she 



hopes lo gel more student participa- 
tion in these activities. 

The new officers are also taking 
a very pro-aclive approach to solv- 
ing problems such as these. 

Charles Newman, vice presi- 
dent-elect of legislation, has recent- 
ly talked with officers at lU- 
Kokomo and Purdue campuses to 
see how ihey tackle these same 
issues. 

He agrees wiih HeiL saying. 
"We're trying 10 get more student 
organizations involved in activities 
We're not lU; we're not Purdue and 
we need to deal with that issue," 

Heil added, "We shouldn't be 
considered a second-rate college. 
But we need 10 make some internal 
changes to accomplish this. 

"You often hear, 'Take pride in 
your school.' But how often do you 
hear, 'Take pride in your .siudenLs'? 
Our professors have our educational 
lives in their hands. They can help 



us accotnplisb our [IPSGA] goals 
loo," she continued. 

Heit encourages students to 
come and visit her with iheir con- 
cerns and ideas. 

"[ am anxious for the students to 
call or write. Give me more. We are 
not trying lo get the things done lhal 
we wanL We want lo get things 
done for the sludenls." 

She also encourages students 10 
bring ideas, no mailer what they are, 
loher. 

"Even if I don'i agree with the 
idea, I have a knack for arguing the 
opposition if it's what the students 
want. I'll do it if that's what ihey 
want. But 1 have to know what the 
students want firsL" she said. 

"1 have a loud mouth, but I need 
to know what 10 yell about " 

Both Heit and Newman hope to 
encourage suidcni involvement in 
maiters outside of IPFW that may 
benefit the university.

By Dodie Miller 
Chief Reporter 



From the streets of Harlem to ibe beltway of 
Washington, the university is bringing one of the 
most respected men in America to the Suminii 
City, General Cohn Powell. USA (Ret ). 

"Challenges of a Changing World"' will take 
place at the Allen County War Memorial 
Coliseum on Aprils. 

Powell is the embodiment of the American 
dream. Powell is an audicntic hero to some. 

Powell grew up in Harlem and found his way 
to West Point From there he guarded against the 
communist threat in West Berlin and Southeast 
Asia. 

He continued on to Washington, D.C., as 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 

Throughout bis military career, he has earned 
the reputation for wisdom, calm .ind leadership. 

This was most visible during the victorious 
Oncraiion Dcsen Storm in the Wl Persian Gulf 
War 

In April 1997. Powell chaired the President's 
Summit for America's Future. 



Since then, he has been serving as chairman 

of "America's Promisc-The Alliance for Youth." 

This national campaign, which works on 

behalf of the nation's young people, was launched 

at the summiL 

The prestige of this is exemplified by the fact 

that this multi-year cam- 

^■1^ paign is endorsed by every

■'I think this is a great thing for IPFW and 
Fori Wayne to have a person of diis caliber speak- 
ing in Fort Wayne on behalf of IPFW," said Butch 
Pcrchan, athletic director 

Athletics expects lo raise between 525,000 to 
S50,000. 

"We diink we can do thaL" Percban said. 

The department continues to think big for 
future speakers at IPFW. 

"We're Uiinking of having Margaret Thatcher 
in 1999," said Perchan. 

For reservation informadon, call 481-5439, 
Monday ibrough Friday. 8 a.m.-5 pM. 



"We (the student body) should 
take an interest in Ihc welfare of the 
state of Indiana," said Newman. 

Newman said he believes stu- 
dent involvement in local govern- 
ment, through voting and lobbying, 
will help let the state legislature 
know that IPFW students care aboui 
the welfare of their university. 

"It lakes the student to make the 
changes Students have got to be 
mad about things. E)o something 
about iL" Heil said. 

Tbey both encourage students lo 
lake an active part in bettering 
IPFW by writing to local and State 
senators and representatives with 
Iheir concerns. 

IPSGA wants to make increased 
student involvement as easy as pos- 
sible, 

"If a student wants to be spared 
the 32 cents u takes to mail a letter, 
drop it off [in IPSGA offices), and 
we'll mail ii," Heit added. 



Newman added that they also 
hope lo bring in local candidalcs 
during this November's campaign. 
TTie hope is that IPFW will be able 
to foster informed voters. 

Students will also bC able to ask 
candidates directly what they plan 
lo do for IPFW and the community. 

Other plans for the upcoming 
term include the possibility of the 
rctum of open forums. 

Open forums would allow stu- 
dents to talk direcdy with the offi- 
cers and voice Uieir concerns and 
ideas. 

Both Heil and Newman stress 
that tbey plan to have accessible 
leadership, and again point out that 
student involvement is the key to 
the success of their lerm 

They said they plan to do every- 
thing possible lo make IPFW a con- 
tinued success. 



The Loft: 

supporting local expression 



Bv Dodie Miller 
Chief Reporter 



The Loft. The very name is syn- 
onymous with artistic expression. 

Such a connotation is satisfying 
10 the Loft's director, Terry Doran 

Doran, who has been the Loft's 
director for two years, diinks that 
more could be done to support 
forums for expression in Fort 
Wayne. 

"As far as the Lott itself, the 
Loft stands for freedom for all peo- 
ple," says Doran. 'The Loft's motto 
is 'an open space for artistic expres- 
sion."' 

The Loft lives up to its name, 
much to the horror of its neighbors. 

The Loft's landlord. Three 
Rivers Co-Op, doesn't have a prob- 
lem with the Loft's activities. It has 
listened to the complaints. 

Doran noies that there have 
been no serious problems, such as 
guns or drugs 

He admits, however, 
that a couple of times 
someone has smuggled 
alcohol into the Loft. 

According lo Doran. 
the minor problems 
should not be a reason to 
close the Loft. 

Doran thinks he 
knows die hean of the 
complaints. 

"Mostly people 
don't want a bunch of 
strange-looking kids 
hanging around," he 
said. 

The Lott played a 
pivotal role in IPFW's 
Diversity Week celebration. 

On Sunday. March 29. die Loft 
hosted a presentation about the 
School of America (SOA), a mili- 
tary training institute located in 
Georgia. 

The objective of the SOA, also 
called the School of Assassins by 
opponents, is to educate Latin 
American Police and Military per- 
sonnel in the ways of torture and 
massacre at the expense of U S. tax- 
payers. 

Yvonne DilLng. is the Acting 
Direcior for the School of America 
Watch, also located in Georgia. 

She is filling in for the Direcior 
and Founder of the organization, 
Fadier Roy Bourgeois, who is cur- 
rendy serving a six-month sentence 
for criminal trespass. 



fdled wiih petitions calling for Uie 
closure of the SOAonio the school's 
property. 

This latest was his fourth arrest 
for non-violeni civil disobedience. 

Dilling is a Fori Wayne native 
and graduate of North Side High 
School and Manchester College. 

She developed an interest in 
Latin America while a student at 
Manchester College. 

In 1979, Dilling earned a B.A. 
in Peace Studies and Conflict 
Resolution. 

Dilling's knowledge of the suf- 
fering in Central America and sub- 
scquenl work with exiled people 
compelled her lo try to "do some- 
thing." 

Through Ihe various talks she 

has given on the subject. Dilling's 

goal is lo close the U.S . Army SOA. 

"I think it's reachable," she 

said. Dilling may be right. 

Last year, the House came with- 
in seven votes of stripping money 
for the school 

The video. "Father Roy: Inside 
the School of Assassins." graphical- 
ly depicted the activ- 
ities of the school.

DUIing's appear- 
ance at the Loft is 
due in pan to local 
concerned citizen 
Jeff Brunson, a 
peace activist who 
knew Doran from 
previous collabora- 
tions, and thus 
arranged Dilling's engagement at 
the LofL 

Dilling also spoke at IPFW's 
Walb Union and the Main Allen 
County Public Library 

For Doran. it is important for 
diverse opportunities to present 
themselves at the Loft. 

"1 think the public has really 
responded; it takes people like Jeff 
to come up with ideas." he says. 
Concern is growing over die 
• fact that after July 1, there will be no 
more shows at ihc Lofi which attract 
"kids." meaning those under 21. 
who usually come oul to hear bands. 
The Loft is important for "kids" 
who cannot go to 21 and older clubs 
to hear local and regional aos. 



"Mostly people 

don't want a 

bunch of 

strange-looking 

kids hanging 

around."

Morons with nothing to do 



To tdc Ediion 

Tonigbi was buisncss as usual 
tor IPFW. 1 passed yci another lii- 
tle Kd sign warning me of a bomb 
ihrcai on my way to class. 1 believe 
ti was the 23rd this season, 

[ am a working person with not 
much time to spare, but I Tell it was 
my duty to attempt an explanation 
for [he over-increasing number of 
phone calls waming of impending 
doom. Pretty soon, IPFW will need 
10 alter their web page to accept 
bomb threats on-line, 

The first thing that springs to 
minj is the typical siuileni faced 
with mid-terms for which they 
were loo lazy to study. It may seem 
to them that for a mere 35 cents ad 
a well-practiced "Darih Vadcr" 
impersonation, the dreaded mid- 



term may be pushed back a I least a 
week. Most professors wiL simply 
march the students Lke lemmings 
to another building and commence 
testing. 

Thai logically brings us lo thai 
age-otd reason for doing something 
abnormally stupid to impress 
friends. What hiend wouldn't be in 
awe if you told them you were (he 
one behind those calls? What if 
you could actually show them the 
sock you stuffed in your mouth 
when you made the call in order to 
fool the pobce into thinking you 
were really far away? I was able to 
discount this for many reasons, not 
die least of which was the S5.000 
bounty on the caller's head, I'm 
sure thai the caller's friends would 
be more impressed by the thought 



Also, the element of originality 
and creativity is long gone. There 
is nothing unique or impressive 
about calling in a bomb threat. In 
fact, it is getting rather boring. 
Bombs have been done to death 
and can not be considered impres- 
sive. 

I have, thus, come to the con- 
clusion that things such as these 
bomb threats are the inevitable out- 
come when a moron becomes 
bored. I can only imagine thai per- 
son sitting on the couch suddenly 
realizing thai there was just enough 
lime for a quick phone phone call 
before the next "Beavis and 
Bullhead" marathon. Brushing the 
nacho crumbs off and securing 35 



cenLs from between the cushions, 
the person is off to the nearest pay 
phone. There is no malice and even 
less thinking involved, bul the call 
goes dirough and has the desired 
effect, the little red sign on the door 
that they can see on iheir way lo 
class. 

I can only offer one piece of 
advice to the morons involved. The 
time spent preparing for. making 
and reminiscing about these foolish 
calls could be better served study- 
ing for that mid-term or final. 
Maybe you could get a degree, join 
the workforce and be able lo afford 
a really good lawyer,

To the Editor 

I was very pleased to see diat 
Shawn Hcit and Charles Newman 
will be leading our student body next 
year. Maybe now the students will 
get the representation that they 
deserve. The past five years has 
given us Greek leaders who do noth- 
ing but increase their own prestige 
while disregarding students needs, 

lust this past year Kevin 
Dorfman and Jerry Springer have 
not done a damn thing to improve 
the student life here at IPFW. I laugh 
at Dorfman for saying that they have 
done quite a bit for the students, I 
could see thai since they did nothing 
then they did not back any increases 
in Student Service Fees or recom- 
mend a tuition hike. Then again 
we'll have lo see ifthis is true. I have 
Ibis strange feeling that we will have 



to pay more next year. I can almost 
surely bet that there were closed 
door sessions with the administra- 
tion that dealt with bleeding the stu- 
dents dry again next year. 

Wake up everyone. This campus 
is going no where fast. It must cut 
the financial strings from Purdue and 
become a separate entity. IPFW must 
stand on its own laurels. This is what 
the student government should be 
involved with concerning this uni- 
vcrsily, 

Congrats to the winners and 
begin a tradition where the student 
government really has the interest of 
the students at heart. I know thai 
next year will see IPSGA become a 
factor in campus politics.

Kids, provoked by peers 



To the Editor: 

The two kids that opened fire 
on their students in Arkansas were 
probably viciously teased by their 
peers. Of course being leased does- 
n't give anybody die right to kill. 

For years, kids have been 
picked on and no adult even tries lo 
stop it. Being picked on hurts like 
hell. It reduces a person's self- 
esteem to nodiing. If dial person 
doesn't care about his own life, how 
is he going to care about anybody 
else's? 



Adults (this means YOU educa- 
tion majors!) must gel it duough 
children's heads thai it is WRONG 
to pick on others who are different 
from them. Not only is diis unedii- 
cal behavior, bul it can gel them 
killed. 

Fun time is over. This is seri- 
ous. A mean comment from one or 
two kids can result in the same kind 
of blood bath in Arkansas.

Where in the hell does Reggie 
White gel off by making an hour's 
worth of racial slurs and get a slap 
on the wrist? 

Didn'l Jimmy "The Greek" gel 
fired from CDS for saying nearly 
■the same thing. He made a general- 
ization based on his interpretation 
of the truth Whether ii was true or 
nol does not matter. He was fired. 
No appeal. No nothing. 

Remember At Capanis from the 
L,A. Dodgers? 

Will Reggie While get die same 
tieatmeni because he is a black 
ininister? Probably noi. Will the 
Packers treat Reggie with the same 
swift sword CBS used against the 
Greek? Yeah, right. And I love you, 
the check is in ihe mail and I won't 
... Do the math and figure it out. 

Why are we so timid lo call 
racism "racism" when it comes 
from someone who is a member of 
a race that has been oppressed. The 
door swings both ways, Reggie. 

I guarantee thai if a white man 
would have said the same Uiings as 
Reggie bad, we would have several 
letters from every ethnic group on 
this campus about bow racist 
America is. Bui since an African 
American said this, we can excuse 
it? What? Arc you freakin' serious? 

What have we heard about 
racism all our lives: racism is based 
on ignorance. Isn't that whal 
Reggie showed the world, Reggie 



showed he was just as ignorant as 
the banjo player in "Deliverance" 
but yet no one will say too much 
because he is an African American. 

On a related note, Mahkiar 
Ndiaye, a-sorry-ass, non-player 
-from North Carolinatried lo gel off 
the book of playing a pitiful game 
against Utah by saying this fresh- 
man "dropped the N-Bomb" (props 
lo Van Smack) on ihc court, 

Ndiaye, who fouled out with 15 
minutes left in the game, has used 
ihis lactic before againsi Maryland 
earlier in the season. 

This is slander (believe me, I 
know a lot about slander) pure and 
simple. Ndiaye couldn't hack gct- 
ung punked by some freshman so 
he plays Ihe race card This is cow- 
ardly bullshit. 

When you lose, you lose grace- 
fully. You don't accuse the other 
team of being racjsts because ihey 
stomped your Tarheel ass. You 
accept the loss and say they were 
die belter team. 

Ndiaye has written a letter of 
apology to the Utah player and 
everything is just friggin peachy. 
Once again we have a double stan- 
dard. If the lilde while kid from 
Utah would have said this, the 
whole team would be going 
through race sensitivity classes lo 
correct the "problem," 

What will happen to Ndiaye? 
Do the math.

Ratliff gets off easy for a couple years 



Sentenced as an adult for burn- 
ing down her home and kilhng her 
mother and sister. Donna Rathff 
has found a home. liaUiff started 
out serving her lime in Women's 
Pri-son until the conservative out- 
cry of Indiana's citizens placed her 
in a juvenile facility. Radiff chal- 
lenged her placement in Women's 
Prison by citing a violation of her 
righLs under the U.S. Constiiulion. 

Well, our concern is for Ihe 
righLs of her mother and .sister who 
are now six feet under due to the 
actions of IKUe Miss Radiff 

Our staff believes that moving 
Radiff to a juvenile facility was 
done in cnor. Although, we believe 
thai nol all juveniles deserve to go 
to an adult prison, it completely 
depends on each individual ca.se. 
But. as for Donna Ratliff. she isn't 
enutled lo that leniency. 

Radiff was 14 years old when 
she torched her home, modier and 
sLster. 

She had reached an age when 
she could comprehend that killing 
is wrong, comprehend the finality 



of her actions and comprehend that 
punishment would follow. 

She acted as an adult, there- 
fore, she should be punished as an 
adult, period What kind of mes- 
sage is that to send lo young peo- 
ple? Hey, we know you burned up 
your house and family, but you arc 
100 fragile lo serve your ume with 
all Ihe other murderers. We jusi 
don't sec the logic behind that. 

Not IO disagree with one of die 
real newspapers here in town, bui 
have they seen ihe goings-on inside 
a juvenile facility? Apparently, 
they have the idea thai in juvenile 
facilities ihe offenders aren't 
assaulted or brutalized and rehabil- 
itation is far greater Yea, right. 

Some of us have known people 
who were sent lo these juvenile 
facilities and believe us. a juvenile 
facility is not a "safe haven." 

Fights break out. offenders are 
injured and there is plenty of learn- 
ing going on. Maybe not English or 
mad), but Auio Theft 101 and 
Menacing 212 widi a 6(X) level 
graduate option are popular. 



Radiff won't be any "belter 
off in the juvenile facility. She'll 
just leant from and be abused byi' 
people her own age instead of older , 
offenders, so why move her? 

The ironic iwisi lo this is that ! 
when Ratliff turns 18 she'll head ; 
right back to Women's Prison. Do ; 
the citizens of Indiana feel thai the ; 
roughly two years she will spend in 
a juvenile facility arc going lo turn i 
her around? 

And if so. what happens to her 
rehabilitation status? The poor ' 
thing will be thrown in Ihe mix 
widi all those law abusers and mur- ; 
dcrcrs. oh, bul that's right, she is ' 
one of ihem. 

Once again, the problem does-: ■' 
n't have an easy answer. But, the 
answer doesn't include going easy 
on the offenders. 

At 14, 1 5. 16 years of age diese 
young people know that kdling is 
wrong and dial it is an unaccepi^' 
able action in our society. 
Therefore, they must be punished 
accordingly. Leniency is NOT i 
deterrent

Internet, AOL, e-mail... AAHH!! 



what's weak this week?: Dennis Donahue 



Well, we finally pur- 
chased a computer Afier saving 
for over a year, my wife and I 
decided thai il was aboul lime we 
jumped headstrong into the 90's. I 
don't know bow we lived without 
one. Granted this is ixniing from 
swneone wbo waiuxl until 1990 to 
buy a CD player fhe worst pan 
about owning your own computer 
is trying lo figure (he damn thing 
out, I've worked on Uiem at school 
and at work, but all I had to do was 
lum them on. ! actually had to set 
thus beasi up all by myself. So far, 
it is working pretty well. 

Then again, there's this Utile 
tbmg called the Iniemei service. 
About a month ago, I ran across a 
free 50-hour deal from America 
On-line (AOL), Greai, I thoughl, 
anything free is popular in my 
house, I bought a Gateway and 
ihey also offer ibeir own network. 
I figured I'd use up ihe free stuff 
firsL No wonder America On-line 
is free, I've heard it is the slowest 
of ihemall. Well, I registered, got a 
member name and decided to jump 
on-line before ihe Duke- 
Kenlucky game. Ai last, I am 
a geek. 

It took forever, what a surprise. 
I reached one site in 40 minutes 
Yeah, hke I have spare lime. So I 
figured I would rather spend my 
money at Gateway. For 516.95 per 
motith, I would receive unlimited 
access. Il seemed preiiy fair to me, 
so I decided lo contact them over 
the phone. After 40 minutes of pre^ 
recorded messages and some real- 
ly crappy WMEE-lype music, a 
live voice was finally heard. I 
explained whal my problem was 
and the voice said ihai be was 
going to give me lo someone else. 
Gee, thanks. 

I wailed another 20 minutes 



and finally beard another voice. 
"Tecb services. This is Jeremy. 
Can I help you?" 

"I hope so, " I said, "Let me tell 
you what I lo|d the guy an hour 
ago," 

After be walked mc through a 
couple of screens, wc did this and 
that and "control-shifted" some- 
thing hke 10 times, he finally said, 
"Okay, Mr. Donahue, 
that should be it Since , 
you are on the line and 
we need il for the sys- 
tem, we'll have to 
bang up. Are there any 
other questions that 
you might have for us 
today?" 

"Yeah," I 
said, "What if 
it doesn't 
work 
mean, 
can 



busy on the weekends bui come 
on. shouldn't you staff for these 
reasons alone? I don't want an 
explanation as to why AOL look so 
long. I've seen the press ireat ibem 
with the utmo.st respect on the 
issue of why it takes so long. 
Frankly, I don'i care. If I 
pay

Look ai die hackers out there, 
tbey can penetrate ihc systems at 
NASA. I guess it doesn't lake 
much, so maybe that is why the 
Internet is so expensive What the 
heck! The phone company is to 
blame also, but I already hate 
them. Is security really even the 
issue? Do these companies have 
Ihe ability to provide good service 
and still make money al a I'eason- 
able price? We will never know. 
One thing is for sure, though. I 
love having my own computer

By Kelly Berqman 
Features Edttoh 

Where were you 20 years 
ago? 

1 was a Itltic brat id 
diapers crying for my 
bottle. I was ju! 
learning to walk 
and talk. Oh, 
was about a 
year old. 

At that 
tioi 

also when 
my mother 
uwk me to 
my first 
mo V i e . I 
have no 
memory of il 
except what 
my mother 
told me of it. 

She said that I 
cried the wbolc 
lime. 

The movie 
was "Grease." 

Since then, I've 
probably seen the 
film about a dozen 
times. 

The last time that I 
saw it was last Friday, 

The nim was digitally remas- 
tered for superior sound and better 
picture quality. 

Since I ba\'e gone and seen the 
. other fdms that have been remas- 
tered lately. I figured that it would- 
n't kill me to see this one too. 

It was a mixture of that and the 
fact that my fiance loves the movie. 

The other films that were remas- 
tered in die last few years that 1 have 
seen really impressed me with the 
technological advances that have 
been made in film in the last several 
yean. 

The Special Edidon "Star Wars 
Trilogy" was the best remastering 
that I have ever seen. Not just the 
added computer graphics, but the 
enhanced colors and the THX quali- 
ty sound, 

1 went into the theater last 
Friday night hoping to see' the same 
kind of brilliance, 

I was not let down. 

The colors of the fihn were 
excellently brought out and it looked 
better than I had ever seen it before. 

The Pink Ladies jackets were 
brighter and Uie opening canoon 
was belter than ever, 

I could not believe the sound 



A^ United Way 

-% of Allen County 



and music in the theater. 

I know thai I could have been 
partially bia.scd to this because 
I have never seen the film on 
. the big screen, but I was so 
\y I amazed. 

/ I , I never really 

" ' / appreciated much of 

the songs and music 
. from diis fihn, but 1 was 
\J impressed by them after 
hearing this remastered ver- 
sion. 
1 was just one of several 
people who left humming "Go 
Grease Lightnin'." and I hardly 
ever hum. 

For those of you 
who know 
nothing 
to little 
of the 
[film 



by John Travolta, and 
Sandy, played by 
Olivia Newton-John. 

This film is full of 
SOs nostalgia, sock 
hops, hot rods, diners, 
the hand jive and a big 
dance contest. 

This film gave a big 
boost to most of i Is cast. 

As we all know. John 
Travolta is now an icon in 
the film industry for his great per- 
formances. 

He starred in "Saturday Nigbl 
Fever" and has had his ups and 
downs until he came back 
played a thug in "Pulp 
Fiction." 

From there on he' 
had very strong per- 
formances like play- 
ing two characters in 
"Face Off," an out of 
work and very 
blc .security guard in 
"Mad City ' and most 
recently, a presiden- 
tial candidate in 
"Primary 
Colors." 

His on- 
screen "sum- 



mer love." Olivia Newton-John, 
starred in .some no i-so- successful 
films in die 80s. such as "Xanadu." 

She bad a tough battle widi 
breast cancer and has now been free 
from the disease for the last five 
years. 

She has turned her performing 
to singing instead of acting. 

Her next album is due out in 
May, 

My favorite character in the film 
had to be Rizzo, played by Stockard 
Cbanning. 

I think it was mostly her name, 
but she was pretty cool, 

Channing's career has really 
taken off in die 90s, 

She starred along side Will 
Smith in the 1993 fdm "Six Degrees 
of Separation." For her outstanding 
performance she was nominated for 
an Oscar. 

Jeff Conaway. who played 
Kenickie, moved away from fihn 
and has done mostly television since 
the film's release in 1978. 

He was on the cast of 'Taxi" for 
three years and then battled with a 
dnig addiction. 

The last thing that I saw him on 

■ fi show "Babylon 5." 

I looked into it. 

and he's been 

on Uk cast of 

that show 

since 1991.

Creed's 'My Own Prison' 

Good for the Cloudy Days 



By Todd Hamm 
Staff Writer 



I love a dark song to Usien to on 
dreary days. 

I love a song that brings out the 
fe«Ung of the moment; redemption, 
guilt, rejection, loss. 

There are moments of religious 
lapse strewn about Creed's song 
"My Own Prison" and the record of 
the same name. 

Most ominously when the 
singer repents "I should have been 
dead on a Sunday morning. .". 

Later, he tells of a boy destined 
to sin in "One," and asks if life is 
worth living in "What's iliis life 
for." 

All among the bitterness of an 
immense guitar tone. 

By the end of this song, howev- 
er, he is le.iis cynical, admitting '"we 
all live under the reign of one king." 

"My Own Prison ' is by far the 
most unique and transcendental 
song released m recent months. 
It is an embodiment of soft- 



quiet, loud-raging grunge. 

The song has its influences. 
There is a hint of media over expo- 
sure of our legal 
system in Uie 
ingenious 
metaphor of 
the couruoom 
within the 




singer's 
mind, doling out thi 
verdict of his con 
cealcd sin. 

And in 
the clean 
riff that 
begins and 
becomes cen- 
tral to this song 
I hear Jimi 
Hendrix, a la 
"Little Wing," 

"Little Wing" is an extraordinar- 
ily majestic and flowing song 



lib 



many possibilities. 

In my mind this riff is perhaps a 
modern counterpart of "Little 
Wing." 

Bom of that same Florida club 
scene breeding ground as Sister 
Hazel and Seven Mary Three, Cn^ 
may be the answer to a world witb 
disintegrating bands like Alice in 
Chains and Stone Temple 
Pilots. 
The singer's voice is unre- 
markably edgy and rough, 
yet is a perfect complement 
of this style of music. 
The record is predominant- 
ly plea-sing to listen to. 
It maintains a unity 
through most songs. 
The character of each is a con- 
tinuation upon the next; most are 
sad-themed and flavored with dis- 
torted guitars. 

Unfortunately this docs 
seem to go stale after a while and 
does not allow for much experimen- 
tation. 

I do, however, consider it worth 
owning and listening to.
