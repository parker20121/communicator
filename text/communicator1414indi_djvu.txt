Those who have succumbed to 
unhealthy eating habits are not 
necessarily unwilling to change Iheir 
diets. Rather, they find it difficult lo 
choose wisely from our abundant food 
supply. Our supermarkets, for In- 
stance, contain many thousands of 
items. Liltle wonder consumers are 
confused! Furthermore, when they do 
decide lo change (heir diets, they often 
listen to the wrong advice.

After all Ihe data is collected, a rough

for approval lo the members of the

"At lhal time, Ihe document will be

is needed in training, hcallh care, 
counseling, and olher personal needs. 
When they identify the various Issues 
addressed by Ihe educational com-

Rupright said, 

Rupright and Giusti are involved in

MODERATION 

Moderation Insures against over- 
consumption or any particular food 
component. For mosl Americans, 
particularly those who smoke or have 
high blood pressure, cutting back on 
[at. saturated fat. and cholesterol In- 
takes Is sensible. This can be done in 
pari by choosing lean meats and by 
subs li luting lowfat or nonfat dairy 
producls for Ihose rich in fals. Since 
foods high in fat also lend lo be high in 
calories, cutting back on Ihese roods 
also helps to control weight. 

Moderation of our use of sodium is 
also important; salt has been linked 
with high blood pressure, and most of 
us consume Tar more lhanis necessary. 
We should learn to enjoy the unsolled 
flavors or food and to cat sparingly of 
highly Salted snack foods as well as 
pickled foods, cured meals and con- 
Over half of the sodium we eat Is 
"hidden" either as part of a naturally 
occurring fnod or more often ns a 
seasoning or preservative that has been 
added. Reading labels on packaged 
foods can help us lo avoid excessive

Surcharge considered 

Those who thought they had paid all Iheir fees for next semester'! 
may have been surprised to find a memo in their lee statements sugge 
possibility of a surcharge, may or may not take comfort in Ihe fact It 
college students in Indiana will be faced wilh the sameproblcm. 

"The same message is being pul into the registration packets at Bloo 
and West Lafayette," said John Carnaghi, IPFW vice chancellor Tor Financial 
Affairs. 

"We were told by (Furduel president Hicks al 9 a.m. Mondoy after he had 
talked tollU) president Ryan that morning, and this islhefoslesl way wcco " 
read," Carnaghi said 

Though Ihe memo admits that "stole revenue has fallen far below 
pectntions," Carnaghi expressed optimism about more funds coming through 
during the legislature's special session, but pointed out lhal even 
back could have large implications for Ihe campus. 

"Even if Ihe slate only pulls back five percent, thai means J700.O0C . 

"Much of the money we were lo receive from the slate Is already spoil. Wc 
are loo kingal all the op lions, "Carnaghi said. 

Carnaghi was hesilant lodiscuss what "olher options"might be

"The effort of the campus personnel and Ihe community is great," said Don

Individual help in the eflort came from Ron Burns' block laying and John

Flood valves installed 



The valves will be opened to slop the lines from backing up any further. 
Pumps will then be lowered into manholes lo pump water into open lines and 
past those which are backed up, Ka Iter said. 

"it should eliminate Ihe possibility of flooding happening again," Katter said. 

The installation of the valves is part of the agreement by which Ihe campus is 
able to receive federal funds for the repairs caused by the flood, said John 
Carnaghi, vice chancellor for Financial Affairs. The federal governmi 
wanted the university to buy flood insurance in addition to installing the val v 
However, it was satisfied wlthjusl valves being installed, Carnaghi said. 

In order to install the valves, physical plant workers will be digging three 
manholes in Ihe lawn ol the west side of the Walt- Memorial Union, and a "

The project began this week and should be completed within 90 days. Katler

stitutions as much as it used to, so 
students make up tor the lack of funds by 
paying higher student fees. 

IPFW students have been faced with a 
i- : 525 Increase per three-credit hour class 
' the last two years, and could p— :l - 



;aid during his 



fact 



i fee 



fall i 



Purdue, West Lafayette, our fiscal 
agent, has projected a six percent fee 
increase for Its students based on the 
expected rate of inflation, 

Both IU Bloomington and Purdue 
approve IPFVs budget, and since 
Purdue has projected a fee increase, 
whether or not IPFW students will face 
one depends on what III decides to do 

So far, IU students have one friend 
who is willing to slick up for them. 
During his state of university address 
last September. IU president John Ryan 
and the IU trustees submitted a (395.5 
million budget request from (he 
legislature that allows for six percent 
inflation and no rise In tuition for two 
years. "Students and their families 
already have been asked to pay more 
than their fair share of the rising cost of 



education," Ryan 

Since the overall state of the economy 
is not good, Ryan's and the trustees' 
request may seem illogical, but ! 
has to draw the line somewhere, and 
Ryan is willing to do so. The future of 
(his country lies in well-educated men 
and women, and a university helps give 
people experiences to think intelligently, 
whether they are full-time degree 
candidates or just come (o campus to 
attend the theatre. 

Ryan's request has been criticized by 
the Higher Education Commission who 
claims that he is limiting students' 
educations because the stale cannot 
make up for the lack of funds caused by 

suggested IU raise its student fees 9.3 
percent for 1983-84 and 5.S percent for 
'84-85. Through it all, Ryan has stuck to 
his guns. 

Whether or not (he overall state of the 
economy worsens, one thing must be 
made clear — higher education must be 
a high priority among budgetary con- 
cerns when the state legislature decides 
how much to fund (hem. Ryan is fighting 
for this goal. 

If the HEC wants IU to raise student 
fees 9.3 percent next year, it is limiting 
students' education, not John Ryan.

The play It entitled "Siller

elicited emoUonal reactions 
whenever it has been per

singularly courageous 
satirist, whose pen is dipped 
in venom and bile, and also 
in the blood of his own

hos been condemned by

writing a ploy he called a 
"vile diatribe against

Embassy concert proves lasting 
vitality of romantic 'Lettermen' 



By B. KELLY 



The i 



I half of the 



The Letlermen concert of 
November IBIh was a most 
enjoyable experience. 

The performance was as 
varied as the audience. It 
appealed to people of all 
ages and consisted of 
romantic pop music for 
which Ihe group Is famous. 

The Lettermen sang a 
collection of their hits in- 
cluding "More," 
"Memories," "Hurts So 
Bad." "Shangri La" and 
"Put Your Head On My 
.Shoulder" as well as tooguc- 
In-cheek rock and roll, which 
fcalured such selections as 
"My Sharona" and "knock 
on Wood." The group rcTers 
to these as their "Lost Hits 
Medley" since due to their 



audience participation, ol 
which the Lettermen are 
particularly fond. Tony 
Butala (lead singer) ex- 
plained, "We like to touch 
people..." 



You Look Tonight." which 
rocketed them to fame In 
1961. The precise harmony 
and blending of voices is still 
there after 21 years. 

The Leltermcn ended the 
show with a collection of folk 
music hits which consisted of 
"Truck Drivin' Man," and 
"On the Road Again." This 



were celebrating II years 
together. This included the 
audience singing along to the 
music. Butala proceeded to 



were so successful with folk 
medley hits. Billboard

said Life. "1 v. 
munion everyday to impress 
the authority figures, not out 
of any real devotion, but out 
of a desire to do well. This 
play really brings back 
memories, and mikes me 
question myself, as a human 
being, as a teacher. It has 
been a great experience 
working with Ihls." 

"There is an Important 
lesson to be teamed from 
Ihls play — well, actually, 
any number of lessons — but 
a big one is the assumption 
that once a person has the 
garb or the collar of some 
area or religious authority, 
they thereafter never need 
any help or support," said 
McCray-Worrall. 

We don't give them the 
opportunity to be human. We 
assume they can overcome 
all their problems, and ore 
not very understanding if 
they show any signs ol 
weakness or frailty. Sisler 
Mary Ignatius is a woman 
with severe problems thai no 
one has ever questioned or 
attempted to help simply 
because she is a nun," 
McCray-W on-all said. 

The aclress-sludent who 
portrays Sisler Mary 
Ignatius, Marly Macke, said 
she is Catholic, and doesn't 
see the play as anti-Catholic. 
"We are not making fun of 
religion, we are only ex- 
ploring the misuse of 
religion. And this is not what 
It is like in the schools 
anymore. My four children 
a parochial school, 

i fine, 

worm, loving instructors. 
But there are people like 
Sisler Mary in every school, 
be 11 Catholic or public, and 
il Is an Issue that must be 
dealt with." 

The closed performances 
are scheduled for Dec. 6. 8 , 
and 9, with at least six panel ; 
members ol every per-: 



"I'm getting my act 
together and taking il on the 
road" has been called a 

Liberation with rock music," 
according to Grctchen Cryer 
and Nancy Ford, who wrote 
the lyrics, nook and music. 
But It is many different 
things to many different 
people. "You can be moved 
by the music, inspired by the 

hope that you will be en- 
tertained." 

The Embassy Theatre

exhilarating musical on 
Wednesday, November 24.
