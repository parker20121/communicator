The fee pays the supervisor of the

Drunk driving friends can 
kill others and themselves 



By nuw, everybody has probably 
heard Ihc had news about driving 
anywhere on the average weekend 
nighi; one out of every 10 driven on the 
road is legally drunk. That doesn't count 
Ihe people who aren't actually legally 
drunk, but who have simply had loo 
much In drive safely 

Toward the end ol Inst month, Charlie 
Butcher on WMEK's morning show 
drank himself drunk on the air to prove 
how little It really takes to become 
legally drunk During the lime he was 
between drinks, he was having his blood 
alcohol content monitored. He wasn't 
even up lo the legal limit when he 
became loo blitzed to run the studio 
equipment properly and had to turn the

Most people who foil within the realm 
ol being legally drunk, however, may not 
even realize they are drunk. They may 
(eel slightly mellowed, but certainly not 

Unfortunately, mellowed Is Just 

enough lo cause death— their own or 
someone else's. 
Driving on icy roads requires mure 



coordinaUon than many people have 
when they're completely sober It's 
frightening to think there are so many 
drivers all around you when Ihe streets 
arc a sheet of ice who have lost the 
ability lo judge Ihc precise moment at 
which lo start applying their brakes 

Drinking alcohol lends lo make people 
bolder They Ihink they can drive. Bui if 
they were on the outside of themselves 
and could see how bad off they really 
are, they wouldn't think of driving a car 

So, those people who are sober have 
the responsibility of wrestling the keys 
away from their Friends who have been 
drinking too much. When a friend gets 
angry and denies he's had loo much lo 
drink, some people are hesitant to 
humiliate him by keeping him from 
driving himself home. They don't want 
lo risk losing that friendship. 

Bui some of us have lost friends just 
because we didn't keep them from 
driving, and that is a very difficult 
burden to carry around for a lifetime. 
It's easy lo make up wilh an angry friend 
in Ihc morning. It's pretty tough lo 
watch one being burled

Smoking: No buts about it 



Special interest groups may cause apathy to disappear on campus 

lly beginning to look 



"This establishment fully realizes and 
supports every person's right lo smoke. 
However, being that several of our 
patrons have chosen to forego the 
pleasures of smoking in order to live a 
llllle while longer, we, the management, 
must humbly request that anyone 
choosing lo smoke kindly not exhale 
while on the premises." 

Wouldn't it be great lo sec every run- 
of-the-mill, always Ignored "No 
Smoking! sign replaced with that? It's 
so much more, well, diplomatic. It's 
nicer li has a ring of "prelty-plcase- 
with sugar -on-lop" to It. How could a 
smoker possibly be offended by 11? 

II Is amazing how protective smokers 
ure of their "right" to smoke In public. 
Websler's defines "right" as a 
•'privilege belonging to one as a member 
of o slate, society or community." But it 
also defines "right" as being "In con- 
lormily with the rules which ought to 
regulate human action." ' 

Forcing an other human being lo 
Innate u known cancer-causing sub- 
stance Is somebody's right? Wow! How 
did that one get cons ti tut ionali led? 

People who are allergic to, or in any 
other way Intolerant of tobacco smoke, 
should nut be subjected to it by unkind 
smokers any more lhan the smoker 
should have to tolerate the nonsmokcr 
quacking loudly like a duck into his car. 

There are certain things polite, well- 
educated people do nol do In public. They 
do nut pass gas or belch loudly; they do 
nol lorego personal grooming habits 
which squelch body odor; they do not 
cough or sneeze in Ihe general direction 
ol other people: and thoy do nol smoke in 
ureas where other people are simply 
minding their own business, trying lo 
breulhe 

Port nf the problem, of course, is 
smokers really need their nicotine fix, 



and their sudden craving for il overrides 
any consideration of appropriate time or 
place. They do indeed need lo smoke. 
They arc victims of Iheir habit. Non- 
smokers should give them sympathy and 

uriil'-i .Umliiin. bul slinulri not hesitule to 

request that they also be considerate 
enough lo do their puffing outdoors or In 
private. 

But there Is another problem, and it's 
a big one. Seems the word "stupid" was 
invented lo describe those who insist 
upon smoking in public. 

"Stupid: deprived of consciousness, 
sense, or feeling, insensible: devoid of 
understanding: possessed ol dull, gross 
folly; extremely dull of perception or 
understanding." 

Certainly unyone smoking in public 
must be "deprived of consciousness, 
sense, or feeling" when he lights up and 
fails lo notice people all around him 
gagging and gasping for air. Surely they 
are "insensible and devoid of un-
