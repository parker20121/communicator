OPINIONS 



September 11, 2002 



Patriotism from tine left 



1 would like \o begin by expressing my 
decpesi sorrow for Ihe loss of lives on and 
since Sept. 11, 2001. I would like lo express 
my deepest sympathy to the families and 
friends, ol all victims of hale and violence, 
both here m America and globally. 

I would also like to honor all those who 
slopped forward, riskine Iheir own lives, lo 
help others who were hurt or suffering. I 
remember seeing the foolage o( the planes 
crashing, the smoke, the fire and Ihe death, 
I remember how my hear! shuddered, Ihe 

compassion 1 fell for the pain and suf- 

(enng of cucryone involved. And, I 
remember my (ear. Not fear for my 
own safety, bul fear of what the after- 
math would bring. 

America was bombarded by a 
deep sense of fear and pain. II was also 
bombarded with a commerciali^ced 
form of patriotism. A distorted form of 
patriotism Ihal demanded support of 
our govermnent and whatever form of 
action it chose to take in retaliation - or 
to keep us safe from this newfound 
foreign threat. 

Tdo not believe that patriotism is 
blind, I believe thai the very founda- 
tion of our country and any true 
democracy is Ihe willingness of the cit- 
izens lo boldly step fonvard to keep 
the government accountable. Willi 
power comes corriiption. America is no 

1 love my country. I love the land and 
the freedoms thai I enjoy I know that those 
freedoms were won by tne men and women 
who would nol be oppressed Our country 
has a long history ol violence and oppression. 
)usl ask one of our country's natives (now 
annihilated, assunilated or living in poverty 
and oppression "--' ■--■'----- 



[f women wouldn't have (ought long 
and hard, they wouldn't have the right to 
vole, to hold oilice or even to say 'no' lo sen 
or any man in power 1( Martin Luther King 
Jr., Rosa Parks and many other black or 
Afncan Americans had not been willing to 
give theu life and liberty lor a small bit ol 
equality, things would be much different. 

Were ail these people unpatriotic 
because they stood strong against an 
oppressive govenunent? Am 1 unpatriotic 
because 1 refuse lo blindly accept and 
encourage our newfound war on terror- 



lobes 



11 off to 



Had a group of exlremisls nol chosen 
Sept 11 to conduct acLs of hate and terror- 
ism, Ihe headlines would have been very 
different. We were a country in an uproar. 
We were a people becoming aware of the 
degree of corrupbon in our government. 
We had had enough. The headlines that 
were scrapped were about eleclion fraud. 
We were a people split, with a leader who 




"Diosc terrorists did lor Bush what he 
couldn't have done for himself; they rallied 
the American people, they suppressed the 
changes that the American people were 
demanding. We have given up so many free- 
doms; we have given the government so much 
power; we have undone what many fought 
and died for — all in the name oi safety. 

The government has enacted the pow- 
ers of wartime, such as the right to detain its 
own citizens without formal charges. Yet. 
vi'e arc not officially at »var. We have 
bombed Afghanistan, killing hundreds ol 
civilians, and still have no idea of where our 
enemy is. Now as the aruiiversary of Sept. 
11 approaches, despite the protests of Its cit- 
izens and many foreign leaders. President 
Bush wants lo begm a new war against Iraq- 
The reason; harboring terrorists. Or, is it 
really control ol oil? 

How long will we sit back and allow 
our government to fle\ its bulging muscles 



with our approval, all in the name o( patri- 
otism? How does this honor the dead? I 
believe that true healing comes with com- 
passion. 

Yes, I believe we need tighter security 
in our airports. 1 believe we need less divi- 
sion among our people. As long as we bleed 
violence and hate, we support terrorism. 
Our nation needs lo act as world leaders - 
not bitter, but compassionate. We need lo 
work toward peaceful solutions regardless 
of political affiliation, race, nationality or 
religion. We are one race, human. 

We can wave our Rags on streets filled 
with hunger, we can wave our flags while 
our children are dying h'om the disease of 
violence. We can wave our flags over Ihe 
bodies of those killed in war, or we can 
begin to heal the wounds of the world by 
healing our national wounds. 

Since 9/11. our government has cut 
both Medicaid and Medicare reimburse- 
ments. Nursing homes have closed and 
health care for our elderly is lacking. Many 
of the welfare programs developed lo give 
a hand up -like chiTdcare for working recip- 
ients - have been cut. Our president has 
consislently sided with the interests of cor- 
porations and industry over the people and 
the environment, yet we remain focused 
upon an unnamed foreign threat. 

I am saddened by Ihe cvpnis r-f 9/11. 
Dut 1 am Deteaved by the current stale ol our 
national and international affairs. In Ihe 
words of a felloiv American taken from a 
website designed to voice opinions about 
the tragedies of Sept. 11, "We may have 
become a nation of flag-wavers since 9/11, 
but I'm nol convinced we have investigated 
our own layers of compassion for those less 
fortunate and less educated." 

Historically (and today) the leading 
cause of violence and death, not only in 
America, but globally, is ignorance. We are a 
wealthy nation, rich in resources and rich in 
heart. We saw that heart displayed by Ihe 
acts oi selfless heroism and compassion last 
year on and after Sept. 11. 

It is my hope that with Ihe anniversary 
of the horrific events of violence and hale of 
last September, that we can begm to heal 
ourselves, our nation and our world. 
Personally, I vole tor peace. But that's just

Belore going any further, I loo want to 
express my deepest sympathy, regrets and 
concern to the many who have lost loved

rible acts of violence. 

I recently read that Sept. 11 could 
cost us, the American people, the taxpay- 
ers, approKJfnately S95 billion. Docs any- 
one know how much Ifiat is? For anyone 
curious (that would include me) that is a 
95 followed by nine zeroes, (I am quite 
obviously not a maUi major.) I can write it 
down, bul it IS such a staggering sum that 
I cannot even fathom it. 

So what are we supposed to do? Pa'

partially correct. We do have prob^

know the answers, and I doubt if any one of 
us does. If you and 1 did have a few valid 
answers, don't you think they would liave 
us in Washington, DC. where they could 
pay us for being such an expert? 

in closing, it should be clear that patri- 
otism is still the lifcbiood of any nation. We. 
or any other people, can not and ivill not 
survive without it. How can a nation con- 
tinue to be strong and prosper if the people 
who live, work and go to scriool there refuse 
to support and defend it? May the victims 
of Sept. 11 rest in peace, and may God Bless 
America, loday and forever.

Venus Asks... 

She envisions herself walk- 
ing down the aisle with her long, 
tvhite. overstuffed dress flowing 
beautifully around her. This has 
been her dream for as lon^ as she 
can remember. Her weddmg day 
ivas sure lo go off without a nilcn 
for she's had it planned out in 
her head for well over 20 years. 
Guys, lor most of your girl- 
friends, marriage is somethmg 
she planned before she even met 
you. Sure, it seems somewhat 
shallow for girLs to do such a 
thing, but why not? It's harm- 
Sitting at my computer 
tonight. [ looked up the average 
age for marriage of men and 
women In America and found 
that for men the age was 26 and 
for women. 25. If this statistic is 
true, then are we already with 
the person we'll marry two. 
three or four years down the 
road? And, if not, shouldn't we 
get busy finding out "Mr. 
Right?" 



chase a ring, although i 
be nice' t realize that a lot more 
goes into a relahonship and a 
marriage other than just dia- 
monds, while dresses, black 
tuxedos and acrylic nails — I 
honestly do! 

However, am 1 at the point 
in my life where I should be 
deciding if I'm willing to commit 
myself lo this person for five 
more years and then find out 
Ihat he's not, in fact, the one for 
me? Or should I take this time to 
explore my other options? Right 
now I assume that he's "Ihe one" 
for me. but am I just still giddy 
about him because it's not been 
50 years, or is this really "love?" 

After watching episode 
after episode of "Sex and the 
City" on HBO, I realized Ihat 
maybe marriage isn't for every- 
one, ii\cluding myself. I see the 
four single women living in New 
York, living the glamorous life 
and nol needing the title at 
"wife" to be happy. 

Has our society grown 



single and on the prowl for the 
rest of your life? Think about it; 
after years ol dahng die same 
person, things tend lo get too 
comfortable and loo (sorry 
boyfriend) boring and blahl 
Maybe we're not meant to get 
married anymore. Maybe mar- 
riage has been thrown to the 
euro along with the fluorescent

Mars Answers... 

First off, those statisHcs are 

Erobably a little misleading 
ecause I'm sure that those stats 
reflect the average ages of peo- 
ple's first marriages... not iheir 
second or third. 

It's my belief that it is diffi' 
cult for a relationship to last if 
neither partner has ever been in 
another relationship. 1 think that 
some people are so in love with 
the idea of marriage that they fall 
in love with the first person they 
date. 

I also think that often peo- 
ple l&gt;ecome so attached to a per- 
son Ihat Ihey fail to sec when the 

Additionally, some peop'e arc so 
afraid of being alone that they 
convince themsetves tfiat tfie 
person they're with is "Ihe one," 

(slight exaggeration); a couple 
breaks up. but the first weekend 
one of them goes dateless they're 
back together! 1 also know of 
several couples who have broken 
up and then a monlh later. 

getting married: No weddings 
for any couple who has broken 
up in the previous tfuee years!!! I 
mean, if you can't go tfirec years.,. 

My advice would be lor 
everyone to take their lime and 
find that special someone, not 
just any someone! After all. 
what's the rush? Two hundred 
years ago it was necessary (or 
people lo gel married by the time 
they were 15 because Ihe average

Trotter serves up five-star presentation 

Chef aims to provide cultural experience, not just cuisine

at noon on Sept. 11 m Kettler Hall, 
room G46. The lecture is sponsored 
by the Anthropology Club, For more 
uJormation, call 2D0-48I-6S42 



Charlie Tt-otler, a world-famous 
chef, was Ihe first guest ii\ Ihe Oirmibus 
Lechire Series on Wednesday, Sept, 5 in 
the Walb Ballroom. The room was near 
capacity as shidenls, faculty and mem- 
bers ol the commuruty gathered to hear 
him speak. 

Chef Trotter owns a five-slar 
restaurant in Chicago, hosts his o\vn 
cooking show, publishes books about 
cooking and currently is in Ihe process 
of opening another restaurant in 
England. Trotter graduated from the 
University of Wiscorisin with degrees 
in polihcal science and philosophy. 

"During my junior year. I decided 
that I did not want Ihe university to 
interfere wjlh my education," Trolter 
said He got a job as a waller, then as a 
bartender. He decided that he wanted 
to leam everything there is to know 
about running a n&gt;stauranl. 



Trotter continued accepting jobs 
in restaurants and kepi Ihem as long as 
helhoughl he was leaminR something. 
When he fell like he could be doing 
something belter, he would move on to 
the next restaurant. He believes Ihal 
his success is due lo Ihe (act that he 
strives for excellence. 

TVolter said that his biggest irtspi' 
ration is Miles Davis because "he never 
plays Ihe same song Ihe same way 
twice," Similarly, Davis is always rein- 
venting music, and Tnaller is always 
reinventing food dishes. He said that 
the constant creativity is what makes 
his restaurant so great. 

Trailer aims to make an aesthetic, 
cultural and social contributions to his 
communily. He is constantly working 
lo improve the appearance of both his 
restaurant and the neighborhood in 
which it is located. He feels that the 
ambiance of the restaurant gives 
patrons a cultural experience 

He makes social contributions by 



raising money for various charities and 
for scholarships for culinary colleges 
and also by reaching out to area high 
school students. 

Three days a week, approiimale- 
ly 20 students with teacher 
chaperones come to Charlie Troller's. 
"They are given a lour of the restaurant 
and then served an eight-lO course 
meal in the studio kitchen. 

EXiring dinner, the students are 
introduced to staff members who talk 
about their jobs, the dishes and explain 
lo the students what e&gt;:cellence means 
to them. This experience helps to show 
the shidenls what il is like to work in 
an environment of teamwork. 

Trotter's lecture was funded in 
part by the English, Bonier, Mitchell 
Foundation and Iv)- Tech Slate College.

9/11: A TRIBUTE 



September 11, 2002 



• It could have been you: One student's perspective 



The /irsl plane hit One 
World Trade Cenler jusl about 
an hour ago In 3 blink, blazing 
clouds tunied to bl^ck smoke. 
Debhs shot out (rom Ihe lower 
[ike fireworks in some morbid 
ralcbradon. Nobody really knew 
whal wa5 happening, cspedaliy 
alter the second aash. 

Ifs nine filly-nine a Jn. now. 
You stand on a crowded 
sidew^ilk, hearl beating like a 
drum. Police cars and (ire Injcks 
line the streets. People are cry- 
ing. Office papers irom 100 sto- 
ries up quietly coast down to the 



down on metal and smoke 
dimbs towards the heavens. The 
wrath of the gods is upon you. 

At first you watch, head up 
and speechless. From around the 
comer, like the incarnation of 
death, a gioy cloak glides loivaid 
you. It's trying to sweep you in. 
Everyone ui sight begins to run 
and you soon follow. The man 
holding the camera in front of 
you suddenly becomes a nature 
photographer. Through his tiny 
lens you all look like a herd oi prey 
running fiom a predator. 

You lake refuge in an alley 
next to a dumpster and hold 
your breath, Ifs like you're in &amp; 
tornado, a man-rnade disaster. In 



masterpiece beat into your flesh 
tike shrapnel. You thmk you can 
take no more. Then it passes. 

You look around. It's a 
modem-day Pompeii, Everyone 
is the sajne color now. Their nat- 
ural hue has been plastered over 
with soot. Your skin looks to be 
bomt to ash — as if you are in 
hell. You just may be. 

You stand up and dusi 
)^oursel( off. 

The sound of car alarms 
echo through the air. Faint voic- 
es are heard screaming, wailing. 
Red flashes from a fire engine 
seep into view like a lighthouse 
bringing you in through (he 
heavy fog. You are greeled with 
a mask and fresh air. People 
around you wail Iheir !um. 



TTiey hold their achy knees and 
heave out debris. You have some 
lacerations on your face and 
arms, A fireman gently cleans 
you up while you look around. 
You're one of the lucky ones. 

There is a man who beals his 
head. 'This isn't real," he says to 
himself. This isn't tiappening." 

Too many people are dial- 
ing up numbers on their cell 
phones. They gel no response. 

Otheis wander the streets 
hke ghosts in holel hallivays. 
They beg you to take an uncom- 
fortable look at a photo of some 
happv person, 

''Have you seen my broth- 
er?" they ask, emotionless. 

"What about my mom?" 

'My fjanci?" 



You want to say, "Yes, Yes, 
I've seen Ihem. They're okay." 

Bui you can't. 

The rest of the country 
waits in long lines lo buy gaso- 
line. Prices have mow than dou- 
bled at some stations. The 
patrons don't seem to mind, 
though. They keep their mirds 
focused on the rudio. Demand 
exceeds supply of American flags 
soquickly that Wal-Mart is forced 
to sell dusty displays at full pnce. 

Soon, night falls. 

Larry Kin^ is speaking to a 
panel of survivors as images 
earlier in the day play again and 
again on the right haS of the 
screen. Families come togelher. 
Neighbors stand on porch steps 
and chat. Strangers acknowl- 



edge one another with a friendly 
smile and a trusting nod. Hopehil 
dona tors, heart-broken, are 
turned away from the Red Cross. 
Children are held and listened to. 

This is your most defining 
moment. World terrorists have 
lold you that it's time to put up 
or shut up. A year from now 
people will lookback and re flccl 
upon your unforgettable day. 
With a bittersweet smile they 
will proudly remember how 
you responded. 

You arc America. 



Paying the price for patriotism 



One year ago, the Amcncan 
public came lo a standstill. They 
weri' full of emotions concerning 
the untfiiiJiable events that were 
occuning. Nobody knew how lo 
react lo the tragic events that were 
bfing broadcast everywhere we 
Icioked. Luckily for us, the mar- 
keters were the first lo lake action. 

Street venders look down 
Iheir tiger blankels and velvet 
Elvis pictures and put out every 
im.iginatle red. while and blue 
ilem Convenience stores pol 
paltiotic bumper slickers, ink 
pens, buttons and other small 
items on their front counters. 

Department stores set up dis- 
plays wiih American flags of every 
5i;o to suit every purpose. 
Clothing racks were full of clothes 
with stars and stripes all over 
them. There was even an 
onslaught of American jewelry. I 
can remember a car dealership 
ofti^nng a free Amencan flag il 



Some of these vendors had 

Sood intentioiYS, All or part of 
leir proceeds were to go lo the 
Amcncan Red Cross and other 
charitable organizations to help 
the victims. We later found out 
that Ihere were a lot of problems 
getting that help lo those who 
needed il. Many more were just 
commercializing on the nahon's 

What did we Americans do? 
Did we gel outraged at business- 
es thai were capitalizing on such 
a tragedy? No! We rushed oul to 
buy our proper share of patriot- 
ism. The best way lo show our 
support for our nation suddenly 
became buying the most stuff and 
decorating. our homes, cars and 
selves in red tvhite and blue. 

Whal did Ido^l pulled out 
an old flag pin that I already had. 
You see, tvilh Ihe outrageous gas 
prices at that lime. 1 could barely 
afford lo get to class. I jusl don t 
have the money lo be truly pain-

ing ill chemistry. 

TO Have you enj^ericnced any preju- 
dice since 9/11, based on (he way you 
dress or because of your nationjUty? 

RA: Well, some people look at mc funny 
because of Ibe way I dress, and some 
people jusl say a quick hello and have 
never really had a long conversation with 
me. But 1 don'l feel any hate vibes, and 
this has always happened, even before 



RA: It's so horrible, and I still find it 
hard to believe that il was Muslims 
who did that horrible thing. 



RA: The day it happened, 1 heanJ it on 
Ihe nioming news, but 1 was rushing lo 
school for my arl class, so L didn't pay 



dose attention lo what was being said, 
and 1 really didn'l understiind what was 
said. My sister was the same when I 
asked her. 

When we got to tfw gazebo where 
the class was to lake pbce. there ^vas no 
one Iherc. Our teacher came a few miiv 
ulis later and told us everyone was at Ihe 
Wait Union waldiing the ncira about Ihe 
attack. Then she asked us where we were 
from and our religion and mote questions 
about Islam, She explained to us bier 
what had happened when my sister asked 
her.Thativaswhen it really dawned on us 
how horrible il wai 

TO Were people's teacHons to you any 
different on 9/11 and after then? Were 
you threatened by anyone in any ivay, 
espedally since you're a Muslim? 

RA: Well, on that day, 1 gol more siares 
from people than usual, and more peo- 
ple flskedmeabout Islam, and if it was 
pari of our religion. People still do 
since then. 

Actually, on that day and the next 
day, my grandma and my father ^want- 
ed my sisler and i to slay home because 
we heard thai people were not nice to 
Muslims because of what happened. 
But we didn'l lislen, I mean we had to 
go to school! (laughter) Bui I've never 
felt thrcaluned by anyone. Even some 
people from IVCR"ai\d jotne oilier 



RA: 1 don't like that innocent women 
and diildrvn are the ones being killed 
ivhen the perpetrators are still on the 

TC Have you been in contact vrith any- 
one from Palestine and if so, how are 

RA: Yes, 1 have, but for about six 
months last spring we lost conlaci with 
them. It was a really scary period, 
because we didn'l know how they Were 
or what was happening to thum. 

So far the/re okay. I lost a cousin, 
an ll-year-old boy- He died of head 
injuries after being shot by Israeli sol- 
diers on fus way lo school 

TO Whal are their thoughts and feel- 
ings about 9/11 and. about Ihe war on 
terrorism? ■ 

RA: They all feel the same way I do. 
And the Palestinians really don't like 
tlie American government because they 
taki: sides wilR Israel, but they feel bad 
that it wa.s irmocent citizens who had to 
die. Mu&lt;Jim3 included.

9/11: A TRIBUTE 



The Communicator Page 7 



Health Matters 

By Andy Welfle 



The Red Cross: Two pints, 1 5 minutes 



You jusi slammed inlo .1 
Irce aX 65 mph, and you can't 
feel j-our legs. As you ate 
slipping in and oul of con- 
sciousness, you are vaguely 
aware of being taken lo the 
hospital, and you think lo 
yourself, "everything is going 
tobcallriehl,-' 

Unforhjnalely (or you 
your blood type is B positive, 
and since that blood is steadi- 
ly leaking out of your body, 
your life is going with it. 

The hospital has run out 
of options. They, as well as 
every other hospital in Ihe 
nabonivide Red Cross ni 



has a cribcallv diminished sup- 
-'ifyout blood type, 

Tnis sounds like the plot 



ply ofyi 



for a 



is a very real, very scary pos- 
sibility Recently. The 
Communicator's vciy own 
John Berry, Gene Harding 
and I went lo Ihe Fort Wayne 
branch of Ihe Red Cross, 
located on 1212 East 
California Road, John was 
doing his civic duty and giv- 
ing Blood (or his charity. 
Hope Worldwide 



As \ 



1 Ihe 



reception area for Ihe 
donors, we were greeted by a 
friendly and informative 
receptionist ns well as the 
sceni of cookies and popcorn. 
After presenting his donor 
card, John \vas given a pam- 
phlet outlining the blood-giv- 
ing processes and dos and 
don 'Is of giving blood. 

Afler a moment, he was 
brought back lo a cubicle lo 
go Ihrough a brief, confiden- 

tain (acts about his lifestyle, 
his health and related mat- 
ters. While this was going on, 
1 talked with two informative 
staff members of the Red 
Cross, Patricia Roberts and 
Kim Grarxnan. 

"We have a critical 
shortage of O positive, O neg- 



ative. A positive, A negative. 
B positive and D negative," 
said Roberts. Ihe Fort Wayne 
recruiter for the Red Cross. 
"Less than 50 percent are eli- 

gble to give blood lo the Red 
ross, and of that 50 percent, 

Lippiy' 
^d with 
some alarming facts slating 
that "of thai sLu percent, less 
than two percent donales 
platelets for cancer palienis," 

The process of donaling 
plaleiels is called phoresis. 

"A cell separator is used 
to collect only the platelets 
and return Ihe red cells and 
plasma to you." eiplained 
Tracy Alexander, the pheresis 
specialist, "II lakes about hvo 
hours, and the concentrated 
dose of plaleiels donated 
Ihrough pheresis is six to 
eight hmcs the amount of 
platelets collected in a whole 
olood donation. Keep in 
mind as well, Ihe shelf life of 
a concentration of platelets is 
only 42 days," 

After my lour of the 
pheresis lab, John was done 
with his interview. He was 
led to a high-backed comfort- 
able chair where a smiling 
staff member sat him down. 
She swabtjcd Ihe inside of tiis 



For those of you not sure 
about giving blood because of 
your ureasinessat&gt;out needles 
and Ihe pain Ihey may cause, I 
asked JoWi what he fell. 
"It hurt for only I 
" when I'" " ' ' 

was no pain-" 

Whal is the best part 
about having successlxilly 
completed a round of blood 
givmg. besides the self-satis- 
nction of helping your fellow 
nvikind? Cookies^ Popcorn! 
Soda' There is a little snack bar 
in the donation area with a 
movie theater-style popcorn 
machine, soda (ounlains and a 
large tray of delicious cookies. 

As we left tfial day, John 
was a tittle lighter than when 
he came, and he also felt Ihe 
pride of doing fiis good deed 
and possibly helping save 
some poor soul's life. 

The Red Cross would 
like your help. To Hnd out of 
you are eligible to give blood, 
please call 1-8D0-B6O-+147, 
There will also be a blood 
drive here on campus on Oct. 
8. from ID a,m, to 3 p,m. To 
speak lo someone at the Fori 
Wayne chapter (also servic- 
ing northern Indiana and 
northwestern Ohio), call

Proud to be an American 



1 can honestly say Ihat I 
will never lorgel Ihe sorrow 
and ache that I felt v.nth Ihe 
events of Sepl. U. 2001, So 
much has changed, yet so 
much stilt feels the same. The 
passage of time has healed over 
some of the wounds left by Ihat 
fateful day's events. 

With the passing of a hill 
year since the lerronsl attacks 
on our nation, the flags flying 



on cars have become fewer, the 
signs in windows have become 
faded and the number of patri- 
otic songs heard on the radio 
lus dwindled. 

This year, I urge each of 
you to remember thei "" ' 






'_ l"= 



vith 



. but also by displaying the 
same patriotic spirit that flowed 
through each American's veiru 
one year ago. 

Patriotic spirit entails so 
much more than just flyuig a 
flag or wearing a pin. It involves 



believing in your country, in its 
dbzens and in its leaders. 

Take a few moments and 
think about what the plu^sc 
"I'm proud to be an American" 
really means lo you. Then con- 
sider how Ihe events of 
9/11/2001 have hindered or 
enhanced that meaning. 

On 9/11/2002, 1 will get 
up in the morning, tell my fam- 
ily Ittal I love (hem and contin- 
ue lo live my life, proud lo be 
an American, 



9/11 provides excuse for government crack down 



First of all. let me say thai I 
am as pahriolic as anyone, and I 
t&gt;elieve in the Conshtution and 
all the rights Ihat it affnrels the 
citizens of Ihe United Slates, In 
fact, that is exactly why my first 
thoughts upon turning on the 
TV and seeing an airplane 
crashing inio Ihe first tower 
were, "Oh my God." 

Those wonJs were immedi- 
ately followed by. "Now our gov- 
ernment has Ihe perfect excuse to 
'aackdovm' on all of us," Ufe are 
all paying for thai altack in many 
ways: emotionally, financially 
and most insidiously, in terms of 
personal liberty. 

The Bush regime has been 
handed Ihe perfect excuse lo 
usurp Ihe freedoms granted lo us 
in the Constitution and has not 
wasled any time in taking advan- 
tage of a moment when Ihe 
nation's defenses were down, 
both literally and figuratively 

tl seems only natural to 
most people that more regula- 
lioiu would have lo be pul into 

?lace for citizens of Ihe United 
tales following such a horrific 
illack on our nation. We sacri- 
iee our liberty every day in 
irder to gain safety. It is a trade- 
off, and a precarious balancing 
- 'i terms of the sacrifices that 
re willing to make in order 
to feel secure. 

Almost everyone would 
agree lo the necessity for 



increased security at airports 
and at our borders, II is well 
worth the minor inconvience of 
having lo spend some extra 
hme proving to security agents 
that our intenbons are innocuous. 

In those situations ivc don't 
mind having lo prove our inno- 
cence, the assumption of guilt 
having been placed on anyone 
who would dare ttiink of travel- 
ing by air now. And so whal if 
people are expected lo tje more 
careful about whal Ihey say 
since the al lacks? If you have 
something bad to say about the 
United Slates, you are free to 
leave, right? Is free speech really 
that important compared loour 
safely and secunty? Should we 
really continue to question the 
govcmmeni in such trying 
times? Well, our founding fathers 
certainly seemed lo think so. 
"Those who would sacrifice 
their liberty for security deserve 
neither liberty nor security," 
Thomas Jefferson once said. 

Consider the USA Patriot 
Act Ihat Congress passed into 
law shortly after 9/11. which 
allows agents the authority to 
secretly search your home or 
business, taking whatever Ihey 
want, and leaving without ever 
notifying you. The Fourth 
Amendment guarantees our 
rights against unreasonable 

probable cause, but who has 
time for details like probable 
cause when you are dealing 
with potential ■ -■- '- 



friends or associates of poll 
terrorists, right? 

Aeenis can now also obtain 
lists of books Ihat 'suspects' have 

Euichased 01 checked out al the 
brary. Be careful whal you 
read too. especially if your skin 
is brown or you are of Middle 
Eastern descent, "Agents round- 
ed up hundreds of non-dlizerts 
in Ihe weeks afler 9-11. The gov- 
ernment has refused lo say who 
h.is been detained and on what 
charges," acconiing to Sunday's 
[oumal Gazette, 

What arc some warning 
signs tor potential lenurists iden- 
bhed by the FBI? Well, home; 
schoolers are on their lisl, people 
who quote Ihe Conslilulion (I'm 
now on their list hvice), pretty 
much anyone ivho has anything 
negative to say about the go«em- 
■:, (wait, I guess I qualify for 



that, tl 



Security must not 
be allowed to become a univer- 
sal juslifier for our government. 
Be informed, knoiv your riehls, 
ask questions, take responsAiili- 
ty for your own freedom and 
don't take Ihe liberties that you 
enjoy as a citizen of the United 
Slales for granted. 

Tlicse things are the biggest 
part of being a patriotic citizen, 
more so than waving flags. 
singing son^ or wearing t-shirts 
emblazoned with "USA Kicks 
Ass!" If you love your country 
like 1 do, then ad like it and make 
a difference for yourself and 
everyone else who lives here.

9/11: A TRIBUTE 



September 11, 2002 



Allow time to heal when remembering 9/11 



ByV 
Copy 



Theatlackon Pearl Haibor. 
The funeral of PresidenI John F. 
Kennedy, The space shuttle 
Challenger explosion. Mosl peo- 
ple from Ihc generations who 
lived ttuDugh these events can 
recall how they were pcisonally 
affected by Ihe news, even 
where Ihcy were and wlial they 
were doing at Oie time Ihey first 
discovered the tragedy. 

Bui the actions of Sept. 11, 
were so shocking, so vast in 
stope, Ihat the events were 
named after Ihe dale itself, 
Americans will forever remember 
the exact dale thai Ihcir national 
sense of security was broken and 
the lives o( thousands ot people 
were lost or forever altered by the 
Icrrorisl attacks on New York and 
Washington D.C. 

The relentltss mediii cover- 
age ol 9/11 was unprKcdenied, 
and millions of people were locked 
lo Iheir tele^isirai scis for houis. 
slanng in dtsbeliel al the disturb- 
ing images of plane crashes, explo- 
sions, fue. bodies falling from the 
sky and dust-covered survivors 
runnmg through the streels of 
New Vork trying lo escape Ihe 
catastrophe at Ground Zero. 

These indelible images of 
dusasterwouldprey on Ihe minds 
of Americans not only in the areas 
directly affected by Ihe attacks, 
but all over Ihe Ututed Stales. 

-In Ihe days after Sept. 11. 
people soughl solace in family, 
friends, churches, counselors 
and even strangers. The constant 
media coverage was difficult — 
if not impossible — to avoid. It 
seemed that each day aflenvard. 
new fjim footage or pictures 
were released, each more alarm- 
ing Ihan the previous one. 



The website for Ihe 
National Center for Post 
Traumatic Stress Syndrome 
(NCFTSD) cites a shidy from Ihe 
days after the attacks showmg 
that about 90 percent of adults 
eupcncnced at least one symplom 
of stress such as feeling upset by 
remii«Jets, nightmares or diffictilty 
sleeping, irriBbiLly and difficulty 
cortccntialins. 

In the months after Sept. 11, 
the news media reported that 
while church attendance, charity 
dorutions and blobd donations 
were rising, so were cases ot sub- 
stance abuse, depression and anx- 
iety among the general public. 

Now, one year later, Ihe 
country will be commemorating 
Sept. 11 in a variety of ways. 
Inevitably, the media will once 
again replay those startling 
images ot a year ago. and the 
nahon will again relive those hor- 
rific moments. It is also likely that 
those images will trigger a return 
of the distress symptoms that 
many suffered last &gt;-ear, a trauma 
response commonly known as 
"armiveisary reaction." 

While mosl people will feel 
bellei within a week after the 
anniversary dale, some may have 
more difficulty coping. 
Forhinalely, there are many 
resources lo approach for advice 
and information lo help manage 
Ihe stTL-ss of reviewing the trauma. 

One of the easiest places to 
seek infotmalion is the Internet, 
and a simple search will produce 
man^ wetsiles featuring articles 
specifically tailored lo Sept. 11. 
I^or instance, a list of ivays to help 
deal with grief, loss and change 
can be found on the Concern 
Employee Assistance Program 
website (wivw.concem-eap.com). 

The American Red Cross 
website Jwww.redcross org| 



offers an article about emotional 
care in the wake of Sept- 11. 
Additionally, the website for the 
National Assodalion of School 
Psychologists (viTvw.naspon- 
Iine.org) tias made materials 
available to the public to promote 
the ability of youth and children 
to cope wilh the anniversary. 

Those on campus seeking 
help of a more personal nature 
can contact the IPFW/Parkview 
Health &amp; Wellness Cknic at «1- 
6601 lo make an appointment lo 
speak lo one of the two coun- 
selors on staff. Their offices are 
located in Walb 111. so students 
can speak to someone immedi- 
ately in an urgent situation. In 
addition to help on campus, peo- 
ple can also contact their family 
physician for treatment. 

While seeking professional 
help is advantageous for some, 
most ivill be able lo experience 
the sights and soimds of Sepl. II 
with feiv distress symptoms. 
There arc simple ways ' 



If the televised images ot 
Sepl. II are upsetting, avoid 
watching television recounts and 
tune in lo something else. Attend 
a ceremony commemorahng Ihe 
evenl instead. The NCPTSD web- 
site suggests that instead of 
watching television, people should 
make a charitable donation, help 
others in need or dedicate a day lo 
be wilh loved ones. 

It Ls important to remember 
that it isn't mandatory lo relive 
Sepl. n in onjer lo remember 
that tragic day and the thou- 
sands of victims hurt and killed 
in the attacks. Much like Ihe 
national tragedies and events 
thai occurred in history before 
Sept. 11, Americans will never 



9/11: A day unlike any other 



The day had started )usl 
like any other. 1 woke up to my 
alarm at 8 a.m. because I had a 
1030 a.m, physics class and 
was driving from Huntington. 
1 had my alarm set lo radio, so 
I didn't have lo wake up to 
that annoying buzz. I haa the 
dial set lo 923 FM for "The 
Bob and Tom Show." 

I'm sure the radio people 
were reporting on what had 
happened that monung, but I 
was tired and groggy and had 
lo get my morning shower. 

I crawled oul ol bed, stag- 
gered across the room 10 Ihe 
clock, turned off the radio and 
went about my mominc busi- 
ness- I took a hot shower, 
shaved and got dressed. 
Everything seemed normal, 

1 wasn't running late, so I 
decided lo have a quick break- 
fast once I got dowrulairs. I 
K3ored myself a bowl of 
oney combs and milk and 
took it into the living room 
where I plopped down on the 
couch. Before digging into my 
cereal. I grabbed the remote 
and clicked on the television. 

My parents usually 
watched CNN lo see what's 

5 Ding on in Ihe world before 
ley left for work at about 7 



a.m. This morning was no dif- 
ferent because when the TV 
came on, it was on CNN. The 
news channel was showing a 
couple of burning buildings. 

"Huh? The World Trade 
Center is on fitc?" I though t non- 
chalantly. "That place has been 
bombed before. It'll be fine." 

1 switched over to 
ESPN. SporlsCenler was on 
just like every olher morning. 

1 had stayed up the night 
before watching Monday 
Night Football. The Denver 
Broncos had beaten the New 
York Giants 31-20, but that 
wasn't what I ivanted to see. 

During Ihe game, Ed 
McCaffrey was tackled, which 
broke his leg. They showed the 

times during the game, but 1 
wanted to see it just one more 
lime that monung. I never did 
get to see it, though, tjecause 
once I finished my breakfast, it 
was time lo go. 

I got in my car and started 
it up. 'ine Dave Matthews Band 
CD that I was listening to the 
daybeforestarted lo play. 1 usu- 
ally listen to CDs rather than the 
radio because 1 can listen to my 
choice of music that way. The 
day was just like every other 

When 1 got to school. I 
drove around campus lo the 
parking garage. I ended up 
parking on Ihe top floor of the 



garage, but I didn't mind. It 
was a beautiful day. The sky 
was bright blue wilh a few 
-threatening clouds, and 



iperaturc was mild. 
"Man, this is eieat golf 



Ihet 



weather." I thought. If it's this 
nicewhenlgeloutof dassina 
few hours, I might )ust have to 
go golfing," 

As 1 walked to Keiller 
Hall, I saw a friend of mine sit- 
tmg on one of the benches oul- 
side the Engineering Building. 
She was on her cell phone, and 
she looked nervous, almost 
panicking. 

"Is everything all right?" 



Tit 






"Well, what's wrong?" 

"My dad's in the Army 
and works at Ihe Pentagon." 

"And?" 

"Haven't you been 
watching TV?" 

"No, I haven't. 1 just woke 
up and came up here." 

She told me that planes 
had crashed into Ihe World 
Trade Center and another had 
hit the Pentagon. I was in a 
stale of disbelief. Things start- 
ed coming togelhet for me at 
thalpoinl. That's what I'd seen 
on CNN before I changed the 
channel. 

I guess the day wasn'l just 
like any other.

Standstill of sports world meets terrorists' goal 

Vlork stoppage of 9/11 robbed Americans of needed distraction 



Arguably the most mfa- 
s day in Ihe history ol not 
only America, but of the 
world. Sepl. 11, 200! will go 
-■own in history as the day of 
horrible tragedy. A/ler 9/11, 
the world was in mourning. 
And. for Ihe first time in 

a; the sports world 
y ceased all activities. 
It started off a quiet day 
for me. I was working on my 
research paper when I 
first heard of the attacks. 
Little did 1 know how much it 
would alfect me and the 
entire wo rid - 

Certainly, the World 
Trade Center and Pentagon 
attacks were shocking. Like 
rmllions of Americans, I sat at 
me that evening and 
ilched in horror It seemed 
far too surreal. But when the 
iports world shut down, 1 
ivas in shock. It wasn't a slow 
hall in aclivities; it was a sud. 
den work stoppage. High 
ichool sports, Major League 
Baseball. the National 
Football League and 
NASCARall slopped without 
ond thought. 
Now I know that many 
. ou are thinking, what is 
the big deal about sports hail- 
ing? It seems unfair lot any- 
lo complain about the 
e of competilion after so 
ly lives were lost, but to 
it was a huge thing. 
Now. I am a reasonable 
guy. 1 can see life without 



-, for 



laybe 



throe da&gt;-s because of 
the attacks. Bui once that 
period of time went by, it 
seemed to me like the sports 
world was contradicting 
what everyone was saying. 
On all of the major nctivorks. 
George W. Bush was talking 
about how we would not let 



this be a victory (or the terror- 
ists. But at the same time, all 

ceased. It didn't make s 



Baseball was the first to 
call a work stoppage. They 
decided lo not play all night 
games on the 9/11 and take 
9/12 off. Then on Wednesday, 
they decided to extend the 
stoppage until they felt it was 
right lo play again. The NFL 
ivas next lo call off games by 
postponing Iheir second 
week of play NASCAR post- 
poned their Loudon, NH race 
until November. Players and 
coaches seemed lo agree that 
there were more important 
things to do Ihan compete. 

As lime progressed, it 
became less of the eHccI 9/11 
had on the sports ivorld and 
more of Ihe effect of the 
sports world had on the fans. 
Never mind that for the first 
time the World Scries would 
take place m November. 
Never mind that the Super 
Bowl would now be played 
in February, The most impor- 
tant Ihuig was that at a time 
when Ihe country was griev- 
ing, we all needed a release. 

Do you think it's a fluke 
Ihat the numt&gt;er ot moviego- 
ers tripled dunne the week- 
end after 9/1(7 America 
needed to gel away from the 
sadness. But when millions of 
Americaris turned lo sporls 
for their release, there was 
nothing lo be found but 
empty stadiums, fields, 
courses and speedways. 

At a time when 
Americans needed these ath- 
letes the mosl, Ihey weren't 
there. I understand that alh- 
Icles are people just like all 
other citizens. But to many 
people, they are more. They 
arc heroes, legends and even 
super humans lo the people 
who watch them day m and 



day out. 

In a time when people 
needed those heroes, Ihey 
were letting Ihe bad guy win. 
They stopped Iheir lives and 
in turn stopped ours. That's 
what the Icnorisis of 9/U 
wanted and that is what Ihcy 
got. 

A iveek wont by and 
finally athletes relumed lo 
the broad spectrum of the 
sports world. They came 
back, yet they decided Ihat 
the world of sports would 
never be the same again. 
Noiv as a year has gone by, it 
has gone back lo ffie *vay it 
was. All MLB games will 
have a 90 second period of 
silence today and lonight. 
There will be tributes and 
memorials today m stadiums 
nationwide. But. what has 
really changed i 



So n 



1 the 



world hold 9/11 dose 
ificir hearts. They hold it as a 
day Ihat made America bigger, 
badder. stronger arul belter. 

Yet alhleles are not bet- 
ter. We still see greed and big 
heads threaten all sports: 
NFL players missing opening 
weekend as they hold out '" 
bigger contracts. MLB di 
to striking and NBA players 
refusing lo represent Team 
USA because the benefits are 
not enough. It all still hap- 
pens one year later. 

The mindless national- 
ism that athletes pounded 
into Ihe fans' heads after 9/11 
may have made some people 
bigger, badder. stronger and 
better, but it hasn't helped the 
alhleles themselves. It makes 
you wonder what the fuss 
was all about a year ago. It 
makes you wonder what are 
Ihey fitting for.
