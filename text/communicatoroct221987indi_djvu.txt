Frank Codispoti's academic career 
at IPFW now siU on lop Chancellor 
Tom Wallace's desk. 

The assistant professor of political 
science had appealed last December's 
decision to deny him tenure lo Ihe lU 
Faculty Board of Review Board chair 
Jeanelle Clausen said Thursday the 
committee finished its review and 
submitted its recommendations lo 
Chancellor Wallace, who has the final 
say 

Al the hearing, held Monday and 
Tuesday, Sept. H-IS, political science 
chair Mike Downs, who represented 
Codispoti al the hearing, said the 
campus-wide Committee on Pro- 
motions, Tenure and Sabbatical 
Leaves had "exceeded Ihe authority 
traditionally and legally exercised by 
such committees" in denying 



Codispoti tenure. Downs also said the 
political science department, as well 
as the Arts and Letters subeom- 
millees, had voted to grant Codispoti 
tenure 

But assistant Vice Chancellor 
Joanne Lantz, who presented the ad- 
ministration's case, said the purpose 
of the campus-wide committee was 
not lo "rubber stamp" previous 
committees' decisions. 

Describing her job as a "horrible 
task," Lantz said Codispoti had failed 
to demonstrate competence in re- 
search. Quoting from faculty reports 
from almost every year since 
Codispoti's appointment in 1979, Lantz 
mentioned repeated statements from 
Downs and Arts and Letters Dean 
Julius Smulkstys saying that Codispoti 
needed lo improve his research. In 
five years, Codispoti's research record 
consisted of one published paper and 
two unpublished papers. Lantz con- 



cluded Codispoti knew (he standards 
of competence but failed lo meet 
them. 

Van Coufoudakis, assistant dean of 
the facility and a full professor in the 
political science department, seemed 
lo agree. While calling Codispoti's 
article "a quality article in a quality 
publication," Coufoudakis told Downs 
that Codispoti's was (he "weakest 
case you have ever put forward in the 
history of the department." 

A different view was taken by 
Smulkstys, who thought Codispoti 
merited tenure. While calling 
Codispoti's publishing record "numeri- 
cally not strong al all," Smulkslys 
said he could remember at least one 
other case in his nine-year term as 
dean in which one article was suf- 
ficient lo prove competence In re- 
search. Smulkstys also noted that one 
reviewer said Codispoti's article had

Faculty to attend union meeting 



BY DAVE BENSON 
Staff Wriler 

The American Federation of 
Teachers will hold an organizalional 
meeting next Monday at noon in Walb 
112. According to Mark Crouch, 
associate professor of labor studies. 
Iwo items expected lo lop the agenda 
are faculty tenure and the campus 
decision-making process. 

In an interview last Tuesday, 
Crouch said eight faculty members 
were denied tenure— a development 
Crouch views with suspicion. "A basic 
principle of employee rights is lo be 
told you're doing a tousy job before 
being fired. These people were told 
Ihcy were doing fine up until the time 
Ihey were denied tenure. Also, if they 
were so incompetent, how come four 
of the eight have already found 
outside jobs?" 

Crouch also decried what he called 
"the revolving door al mahogany 
row." Mahogany row refers lo tho 
administrative suites in KetUcr Hall 



out of Bloomington. 1 don't report to 
anyone here at IPFW " 

Nonetheless, even if a union were 
established at IPFW, Crouch does not 
see a strike as a likely event. "Infor- 
mation workers don't think 
collectively," said Crouch 



"made a contribution lo political 
theory"— a compUmenI seldom re- 
ceived by IPFW polilical science pro- 
fessors. Smulkstys also praised 
Codispoti as a "lough, demanding and 
inspiring" professor. 

Downs concluded his defense by 
saying that Frank Codispoti was a 
valuable member of the department 
and would be difficult lo replace 
Downs also said Codispoti was further 
along in his career than Downs or 
Coufoudakis were at similar points in 
their careers 

Frank Codispoti joined the faculty in 
1979 as a Visiting Lecturer. He was 
promoted to assistant professor in 



Treasurer's post 
to be abolished 



The Student Senate voted to abolish 
the post of treasurer at the 
Wednesday, Oct. H, Student Senate 
meeting. 

The move to abolish the treasurer's 
post came on a constitutional 
amendment introduced by Constitution 
Committee Chair Robert Bishop. The 
amendment eliminates the treasurer's 
post from the constitution and gives 
Ihe treasurer's duties lo the 
appropriations chair. 

The move was praised by Vice- 
President Phil Downs. "In the past 
whenever we would want to spend 
money the appropriations chair would 
have to go to the treasurer, which 
slowed everything down. All the 
treasurer really does is present a re- 
port al the beginning of the semester. 
A monkey could do the treasurer's 
job." 

The treasurer's post had been 
vacant due to Ihe resignation to Jim 
McCarthy Iwo weeks ago in a personal 
disagreement with President Kurt 
Gregory. 

In another personnel change, 
Gregory announced thai Danielle 
Saavedra will be the new Clerk to the 
senate.

and Crouch charges administrators 
only plan to bt thtie a short while 
Crouch said administration officials 
make decisions based on a short-term 
view designed lo enhance their own 
careers, rather than improve IPFW. 

Crouch also said the "collegial 
model" of decision making is disap- 
pearing in favor of the "managerial 
model." In the past. Crouch said, the 
Faculty Senate and the administration 
cooperated to make decisions. Now 
decisions are being made by the ad- 
ministration alone, Crouch said. 
"When the administration acts like the 
managers then faculty should act like 
information workers." 

A union would protect those faculty 

members too frightened to speak out __ ._ ._ .__ 

against the administration for fear of especially for college seniors, 
losing their jobs. "Bui I can talk to the What may be even more troublesome is the best way lo get a job once you've

situation. I am connected lo "^^^ '"'''" network of preparing students for the job search has started in 
"Career Alert." Over 60 companies have listed their names with IPFW to find 
prospective employees from the graduating seniors. There is an average of 400 
studenis who find entry-level positions using the placement service available 
through the college, and the statistics are increasing yearly. A complete list of 
these companies and pertinent information (salaries, degrees needed, and loca- 
tion! can be located al Career Services. 

IPFW and Career Services are striving to acquaint the students with what is 
available on campus. Several workshops have been augmented; some dealing 
with resume writing, interviewing techniques, and management training ses- 
sions; olhers deal with salary and promotion information, and career assess- 
ments. 

"We want to share our experiences of dealing with recruiters; Ihere will be no 
glorified-glassy promises, jusl honesty and knowledge," stressed Linda Scott, 
assistant director of Placement Services "We want lo expand the consciousness 
of the sludenU to what's available on the job market, whal to look for. Over 8096 
of the jobs listed here are only through the school or in the biLsiness' own network 
of offices and people. The other 20% of jobs are listed on the common market!" 

Another emphasis of Scott's is that the job market is changing: "Big man- 
ufacturing companies sUch as Dana, G.E., and General Telephone are culling 
back, plus Ihey already have the personnel they need to run the business. We 
want lo show the advantages of the smaller company, where the chance of 
advancement is much greater." 

For the student who already has a job, IPFW is offering a new service. This 
program is to benefit those new degrees with topics on job security, moving 
upward in the company, office politics, and analyzing jobs for the most potenlial. 
Scott, along with Marion Adair, director of Career Services, and Bev Bollinger 
and Deb Conklin, has a wide array of programs and articles lo aid sludents and

Ball an IPFW asset 



Although IPFW isn't known as 
the sports capital of the world, 
there is a valid reason to pay at- 
tention to its volleyball program. 

Arnie Ball is currently serving 
his seventh season as IPFW's 
women's head volleyball coach and 
will soon begin season number 
eight as men's coach. 

Last season both teams finished 
their seasons ranked 14th in the 
nation and the women's team took 
the Great Lakes Valley Conference 
(GLVC) crown for the second time 
in three 'years. They also finished 
with their best record ever at 30-4. 

During his breaks from coaching 
at IPFW, Coach Ball has been ac- 
tive in coaching all-star teams 
from across the nation. 

This summer he led the men's 
North squad to a gold medal at the 
U.S. Olympic Festival in Raleigh. 
North Carolina, 

In 1983, Ball was selected as a 
coach at the National Sports Fes- 
tival in Colorado Springs, Colorado, 
and in 1985 he served as an assist- 
ant coach of the U.S. men's team 
that competed in the World Uni- 
versity Games in Kobe, Japan. 

Ball, who has also served as Act- 
ing Athletic Director at IPFW since 
February, has earned such an out- 
standing' coaching record that you 
may call him the Bobby Knight of 
volleyball- The only noticeable dif- 
ference between the two is the 
players seem to like Coach Ball. 

Not only is Ball an excellent 
coach but he has also played the 
sport competitively in the United 
States Association for 18 years, 
earning many awards. 

At Ball State University, Ball 

filayed three years of varsity vol- 
eyball, acquiring all-conference 
honors his senior year as well as 



being team captain and MVP. He 
graduated from that school with 
B.S. and M.A. degrees in physical 
education. 

After graduating. Ball taught at 
New Haven High School before 
moving to Harding High School 
where he coached baseball as well 
as men's and women's volleyball. 
His men's team won three Indiana 
Volleyball Coaches' Association 
state championships over the ei^ht 
year stint and his combined win- 
ning percentage of men's and 
women's coach was 75%. 

Ball and his team recently re- 
turned from a trip to Hawaii where 
they thoroughly impressed the 
Hawaiian volleyball-crazed fans. 
Not only did they impress the fans, 
but the Hawaiia'n media also paid 
special attention to the Lady Vol- 
ley dons, including radio and TV 
coverage. 

It's a shame that they can't re- 
ceive similar coverage in their 
hometown. 

IPFW may not compare to the 
Division I schools like lU- 
Bloomington, but we still have a 
quality sport, with our volleyball 
program. 

You can hear a multitude of re- 
ports about Indiana or Purdue 
University sports on local TV or 
radio. But in Fort Wayne, where 
local sports should take prece- 
dence, nothing is heard about the 
IPFW Mastodons — even though 
we have nationally-ranked teams. 

The Communicator editorial 
board would like to challenge the 
Fort Wayne area media to give 
IPFW sports - in particular Coach 
Arnie Ball and his VoUeydons - as 
much coverage now and in the fu- 
ture as we have in the past. 

They certainly have earned it. 



Financial aids are available 



Money for College 



College is part of Uie 
American Dream. But costs 
can turn it into a night- 
mare. The good news is 
private source scholarships, 
grants and loans. 

Vour eligibility for pri- 
vate source awards has 
nothing to do with govern- 
mental financial aid. 

You are eligible for 
awards based on factors in 
your (or your parents'! 
background. For example, 

—Are a college-bound 
high school student, you are 



eligible for a 5500-54000 
competitive award for pho- 
tography (b&amp;w). Must be a 
U.S. citizen or legal 
resident. 

—Have Ijeen a caddy for 
two years, you are eligible 
tor an award covering col- 
lege tuition &amp; housing. Must 
be U.S. citizen or legal 
resident. 

-Are the child of a TWA 
(transit) union member, 
you are eligible for Si ,200 
college award.

Notes 



■■Excuse me! Yeah, you 
with the coffee breath. 
What time is it?" 

"It's time for people like 
you lo come up with a new 
line for meeting people like 
me!" 

"Hey. pal. 1 wouldn't hit 
on you if you were a Pinata, 
What do you think I am 
anyway? A student abuser? 
I can get time from any- 
one." "Then be my guest." 

"OK! But what time?" 

"What time whaf" 

"What time do you want 
me to be yoiu- guest? I 
never turn down a home 
cooked meal." 

Can you believe it! You're 
halfway through the 



semester, you're scheduling 
for the next one, and you 
haven't even really studied 
yet! And you thought you 
were the only one in your' 
shoes. 

The fact is, that there are 
many people in your shoes, 
or have been. I'm sure that 
is a comforting feeling, 
knowing you'll never walk 

But I've got some seri- 
ously sad news. Every time 
you step into a pair of 
shoes, you're walking with 
every other person who has 
ever been in those shoes. 
Now that can t&gt;e a little 
discomforting, when you 
stop to consider what kind 
of foot maladies some of 
these other people may 
have had. They may have 



had the dreaded foot rot 
disease, or worse yet they 
may have had the dreaded 
fungus. Yes, there may 
very well be a fungus

This month is National 
Aids Awareness Month. As 
if you weren't aware of it 
last month! So BEWARE 
and be aware. 

Last week was also mid- 
term week. As if you didn't 
know! I would venture to 
say that both factors will 
contribute greatly to the 
changing sleeping habits of 
IPFW students. If they 
haven't, they should! 

The latter, by causing 
unwary students to stay up 
to all hours in an attempt to

exam preparation. The 
former will contribute 
by... well, I'll let you put 
that on your calculator and

Tri\'ial disputes 
disrupting senate 

To the Editor: 

As a student of IPFW, 
last week's front page ar- 
ticle "Gregory accepts two 
student resignations" left 
me with genuine concern. 
In reading the details of 
Winona Peter's resignation, 
and based on "common 
business sense," my gen- 
eral feeling is that she ap- 
parently knew who did the 
"hiring and firing" when 
she accepted employment. 
The petty dispute may have 
"hurt her feelings," how- 
just that- petty! 



It 



thai 



former Treasurer James 
McCarthy 111 would resign 
based on such triviality. 
However, as I recall, he 
also was a vehement critic 
of the senate membere only 
a few weeks ago in his 



letter to the editor as pub- 
lished in The Commu- 
nicator. It woidd follow that 
he has no apparent loyalties 
lo Student Government or 
the student body itself. 
Therefore, perhaps he 
should not be in a position 
of office anyway! 

When 1 see our president 
spending the day in a 
wheelchair in support of 
National Handicap Aware- 
ness Day; former Dean 
John Ulmer receiving re- 
cognition tor many thank- 
less years of blood, sweat 
and tears in support of stu- 
dents; the team effort in 
establishing a fair smoking 
policy on campus; and 
Students' Government tak- 
ing an active role in the 
fight against AIDS (and on 
it goes), I feel honored and 
proud lo be represented by 
these concerned and dedi- 
cated young men and 

Personally, the Senate, 



SUBOG, and our president 
have my full support. I sin- 
cerely hope that ihey will 
he allowed to forge ahead in 
a productive fashion leaving 
the personality conflicts lo

College campuses 
do little about AIDS 



To the Editor: 

AIDS. The disease name 
is recognized on almost any 
college campus in America, 
But what is done by these 
institutions to provide ed- 
ucation and information 
about the disease? The 
Sept. 23 issue of The Chron- 
icle of Higher Education 
published an article which 
states that 75% of college 
campuses have done little 



or nothing lo share infor- 
mation about the disease 
and its effects. The Chron- 
icle reports there are 12 
million students enrolled in 
American colleges, repre- 
senting 5% of the adult 
papulation. This is an ideal 
setting to share accurate 
information about AIDS, 

Monday. Oct, 26, lo 
Sunday, Nov. 1, has been 
proclaimed AIDS Aware- 
ness Week in Fort Wayne, 
IPFW, six of the other post- 
secondary schools in our 
city, and several commu- 
nity agencies will be pre- 
senting programs, panel 
discussions, and various 
other learmng opportunities 
during this week. Two plays 
will also be performed Ihat 
deal with the various as- 
pects of AIDS, 

People frequently ask 
why AIDS is so different 
than cancer or heart dis- 
ease affeclmg large num- 



bers of Americans every 
year. The majority of per- 
sons with AIDS (PWAi are 
Iwtween 20-40 years of age. 
The lost human potential is 
enormous. Like the in- 
dividuals with cancer or 
heart disease, the emotional 
and financial cost is very 
high, but in addition the 
PWA's and their loved ones 
also have to deal with the 
discrimination and isolation 
that loo frequently ac- 
company the disease. At 
present, PWA lives are be- 
ing extended, but there is 
no cure. 

Whether you are student, 
administration, support 
staff, or faculty, plan to 
participate in several of the 
AIDS Awareness Week ac- 
tivities. Become informed, 
and become involved.

ALIVE and the Jazz En- 
semble are having their 
first concert on Sunday, 
Nov. I, al 8 p.m. in Neff 
Recital Hall. This is not 
only the first concert of the 
session but is also the first 
time ALIVE and the Jazz 
Ensemble have gotten to- 
gether to host a joint 
concert. 

Naturally, the concert 
wilt be all jazz, with the 
Jazz Ensemble doing their 
numbers, the ALIVE doing 



theirs, and then both groups 
performing together to 
round off the evening. 

ALIVE, states Michael 
Hay den, director, is the 
only curricular vocal jazz 
ensemble in Indiana. The 
group features scat singing, 
improvisation which is 
comparable to a jazz band 
having thirly-lwo measures 
to improvise. 

ALIVE is not chor- 
eographed. They do how- 
ever, have costumes. Back 
when they were merely a 
swing choir the colors of the 
costumes were red and 



white. Now they are black 
and gold. The men will 
wear black tuxedos and the 
women will be in black 
dresses of their own design 
with gold metallic lace 

This Is Morten's first year 
at IPFW. Morten is also the 
Director of Music at the

The album cover reads

Side one starts off with a

"Tougher than the Rest"

which is one of my favor-

It's lime all the teeny-

I must admit the first

Fantasy is one of the few 
genres of melodrama and 
camp enhance— and en- 
hance this one they do In 
"The Princess Bride," the 
slight overacting only adds 
lo the humor. The pompous 
prince, the almost-as pomp- 
ous pirate, and the stereo- 
typical villains all do in- 
tellectual battle for the first 
half of the film and physical 
battle for Ihe latter half for 
the ultimate possession of 
the princess bride-to-be. 

The humor in the movie 
was not generally of the 
laugh-out loud-variety, 
however, the scene with 
Billy Crystal's already fa- 



mous Magical Max and his 
wife (Carol Kane) was a 
bellylaugher's delight. 

Robin Wright (Kelly on 
Sanla Barbara) who plays 
the shrewd -but -a la s- 
powerless Princess But- 
tercup and Gary Elwes (her 
suitor Westley) both con- 
vincingly portray (heir re- 
spective roles, 

I tip my hat to Rob 
Reiner for his direction in 
this film. It is sure to join 
the ranks as with "Stand by 
Me" as a hit.

Car classics gather 

Saint Francis College is the site of an automotive show 
sponsored by the North Eastern Indiana Sports Car Club, 
the tenth such event. 

The show, titled ''Classics 'Round the Castle. A Celebra- 
tion ot the Auto as an Art Form," will be Saturday, Oct. 24. 
beginning at 10 a.m. 

"To some, the auto is simply a means of getting from 
poinl 'A' to point "B'," slated LeWayne Fisher, event coor- 
dinator, "but there are those of us whose appreciation of 
fme autos has a much deeper meaning. For us, aulos are 
nothing less than rolling sculpture." 

There will be different classes of cars at the event: pre- 
war sports ears, 1947-67 sports cars, 1968-present sports 
cars, pre-war GT cars, GT cars 1W7-67, GT cars 196a-

Piazza challenges Greg 



As a way of introducing 
IPFW's new men's bas- 
ketball coach, Andy Piazza, 
to the Fort Wayne commu- 
nity, WPTA-Channel 21 
sportscasler, Greg Johans, 
dropped by the Athletic 
Center Wednesday, Oct, 14, 
fpr a game of Mastodon. 

The game was aired as 
part of the "I Challenge 
Greg" segment of the 21 
Alive News this past 
Tuesday and was a lake off 
on what is usually called 
HORSE. 

In the game, one of the 
two players involved picks 
a spot on the floor to shoot 
from. If he or she hits the 
shot, their opponent must 
duplicate the effort from 
Ihe same spot or be as- 
sessed the letter H as a 



penalty 

If the first shooter misses 
the shot, the second player 
has the option to choose 
where he or she will shoot 
from. 

As the game continues, 
the player missing a shot 
afler his opponent has made 
his is assessed the remain- 
ing letters in the word 
HORSE, one letter al a 
lime The player who 
completes the word due to 
missed shots loses the 
game. 

In this version, the word 
MASTODON was sub- 
stituted for HORSE, Piazza 
didn't waste any time heal- 
ing Johans, not giving up a 
single letter. The coach 
may have had a slight ad- 
vantage over the sports- 
caster as Piazza played a 
year of professional bas- 
ketball in Europe after his 



graduation from Central 
Michigan. 

Piazza led the Reykjavick 
Knattspyrnufelag Bas- 
ketball Club to the Eur- 
opean National Champion- 
ship, scoring an average 
28.6 points a game. The 
coaches winning shot is 
aplly named "Piazza's 
Point Producing Play," 

"I knew I had to go 
against a coach, but did not 
know I was going against 
an ex-pro player," said 
Johans. "If I had known 
that I would have brought 
Larry Bird along to be my 

"All the pressure was on 
me," said Piazza. "Now if 
only our team tares as well 
ihis winter." 

"I'm thankful to TV 21 for 
the positive public relations 
here at IPFW," Piazza 



A large and enthusiastic 
crowd turned out for the 
IPFW Volleydons' matchup 
Friday night, Oct, 16. their 
first since reluming from 
playing in Hawaii. 

Lewis University was 
their opponent, ranked nth 
in the nation and having 
beaten the IPFW team on 
Friday. Sept. 25. This con- 
test, as opposed to the first, 
was played on the Dons' 
home court. 

IPFW's starting team 
consisted of Caria Gerardot, 
Shari Hanna, Julie Hefty, 
Joni Smith. Judy 

Yagodinski and Lisa Zehr, 

Lewis won the first two 
games, their play consisting 
of several strong saves. The 
final scores were both 15-8. 
Lewis needed only one win 
to take the match. 

IPFW never fell behind in 
the third game and won it

(ell a big defensive play by 
[PFW after they had fallen 
twhind, 14-11, "turned the 
match around."

St, Joseph's went much 
easier for the girls None of 
the games were really close 
as IPFW won 15-0. 15-4 and

take a look at what next 
year's group will look like." 

Coach Ball was "very 
appreciative of student in- 
volvement" in regards to 
the numlJCr of fans that 
showed up for Friday 
night's game,
