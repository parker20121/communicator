Have news organizations 
crossed the line trom 
information to gossip? 



According to FAIR.org, profit-driven news organi- 
tions are under great pressure lo boost ratings by 
sensationalizing the news: focusing attention on lu- 
rid, highly emotional stories, oJten featuring a bizarre 
cast of characters and a gripping plot but devoid of sig- 
nificance to most people's lives. Many news agencies have 
become more and more dependent on tabloid soap operas 
to keep profits high. 

In the United Slates, the media is ovetrun by sensationalism. 
Paris Hilton takes precedence over soldiers in Iraq; 'Brangelina' 
is splattered all over print news as well as the Internet. Young 
people preferYoutube.com to CNN or standard newspapers. 
At the recent Omnibus lecture by Carl Bernstein at IPFW, he said 
that even news broadcasts are becoming filled with more fluff and 
less substance because consumers demand that it be so. 
But where does the media draw the line between First Amendment 
; rights and decency? 

The battle lines are not so clearly drawn. Look at any Cosmopolitan 
magazine and the front cover is littered with sex, sexual tips and how 
lo be sexier in bed. In some publications, the word sex is rarely per- 
milled. Why? Different publications cater to different readerships. 
While newspaper sales are declining in every state and Internet hits 
;ire grooving exponentially, regulation of content is becoming more and 
[Hore difficult. And iviih that challenge to stay profitable, do newspa- 
pers bend to the will of the readership or continue on the straight and 
narrow? 

Recently, The Communciator was riddled with scandal as the publica- 
tion attempted to find the balance between dealing with world issues and 
the will of die people. 

There is no easy answer to the question of decency vs. First Amendment, 
but publications must take stock of their consumers in order to provide ef- 
fective reporting. 

The basic notion of every type of media is to provide information in an un- 
biased manner, and as Joe Friday said, to provide "just the facts, ma'am". 
There are those rare times when fact is more controversial than fiction. Take 
ihe case of Colorado State University editor-in-chief David McSwane, who 
published a four-word editorial saying, "Taser this: F"k Bush". 
After a fairly lengthy hearing regarding the column. The Collegian board de- 
cided that McSwane was covered under the First Amendment, which states,

At least 50 percent of 
sexually active people 
in the United States will 
contract the human pap- 
illomavirus tHPV) during 
their lifetime. Currently 
in America, there -are 
roughly 40 million peo- 
ple who have one of the 
40 types of HPV, which is 
the most common STD 
among Americans. 

A new vaccine called 
Gardasil was released 
by the Food and Drug 
Administration last year 
and is now on the market 
to prevent againsi kiur 
main type;, ofHPV. 

Women ages nine- 
26 take this three-dose 
vaccine which prevents 
agamsl Uie types of HPV 
that cause 70 percent of 
cervical cancer in wom- 
en and the types that 
cause almnsi 90 percent 



of genital warts in botli 
men and women. This 
vaccine does not treat 
existing HPV, hut is a 
preventative. It is most 
effective if women fin- 
ish the series before they 
becomes sexually active. 
There are few side effects 
of ilie vaccine such as 
pain, redness, or swell- 
ing where the shot was 
injected. Serious side 
effects arc rare, but 
mare research on the 
vaccine will be done. 
Women who are 
pregnant should wait 
until after pregnancy 
to lake (he vaccine. 
As long as a woman 
is in [he age range of 
iiuiu-:;(., most insur- 
ance companies are 
willing lo pay for the 
vaccine. So if women 
are in the age range 
and are sexually ac- 
tive, why not take a 
vaccine that might 
save your health in the 



long run?

Letter to the Editor 



Dear Editor: 

We are WTiiing lo ex- 
press our ver&gt;' strong ob- 
jection to the front page 
headline and siorj' of the 
October 3 issue of tlie 
Communicator. Not only 
is this an example ofpoor 
journalism, it is inflam- 
matory and obscene. 

Not all people, espe- 
cially the younger stu- 
dents on our campus, 
recognize or understand 
satire. Moreover, to put 
it on the front page of a 
newspaper lends false 
credibility and gives the 
stor&gt;' the appearance 
Ehalil is factual. 

Further, the tremen- 
dous insensitivity of tlie 
piece reveals a profound 
lack of understanding of 
the nature and uses of 
satire; some topics are 
simply not appropriate 
for satire. Substitute the 



words "Blacks" or "Jews" 
or "Disabled" or even 
"Christians" for "Gays" 
in your headline and this 
provides a perspective 
on how inappropriate 
and damaging the nature 
of the satirical article is. 
That wouldn't happen, 
would it? 

Yet, se.xuai minorities are 
still acceptable as targets 
for degrading humor by 
some segments of soci- 
ety and your article plays 
right into these tenden- 
cies. The use of deroga- 
tory' slang words for gays 
and lesbians in the article 
serves no real purpose in 
making your point, ap- 
parently included for the 
sake of being sensational 
and provocative. 

We strongly encour- 
age you to recognize and 
confront the homopho- 
bic nature of the article. 



In fact, we would suggest 
that the author of the 
article and the entire 
Communicator staff go 
through training related 
to ethics and sensiti\nt\' 
regarding sexual minor- 
ity issues. As a matter of 
fact, we would be happy 
10 provide this training. 
We would also recom- 
mend that the Commu- 
nicator staiT reread their 
texts on ethics in jour- 
nalism. Beyond this, we 
strongly encourage all 
students, staff, and facul- 
ty al IPFW to go through 
Safe Zone training, as 
well, a program that",., is 
designed to raise aware- 
ness and broaden under- 
standing of colleagues 
and students who iden- 
tify as lesbian, gay, bi- 
sex'ual, or Iransgendcred 
(LGBT). Workshop par- 
ticipants are encouraged 



to identity their o\vn per- 
sonal characteristics and 
scripts' that help them 
authentically empathize 
with LGBT individuals." 

We certainly are not 
advocating censorship 
of newspapers. Yet. a 
substantial obligation of 
responsibility and sensi- 
tivity necessarily accom- 
panies freedom of the 
press. 

Finally, we request that 
an apology be placed on

An apology from the editor-in&lt;hief 



We at the Communica- 
tor have entered a stage 
of rapid development 
and change, giving the 
students and communi- 
ty members of the IPFW 
family a more appropri- 
ate forum for the expres- 
sion of ideas. Part of 
that change has been to 
push tlie limits of growth 
and boundaries, while 
maintaining responsible 
journalism and a strong 
sense of ethics. 
With the Oct. 3 issue, we 
failed to do those things. 
The culmination of the 
front page satire, Vote 
Condom, and the choice 



of vulgarities were used 
in poor taste and offend- 
ed many of our readers. 

While the content was 
never meant to offend or 
hurt readers, their fami- 
lies or their friends, that 
was regretfully the result. 
Due to certain negli- 
gence and an attempt 
to create more thought- 
provoking material. I did 
not pay close enough at- 
tention to all of the mate- 
rial that was included in 
the Oct. 3 issue. This was 
wrong, and as editor-in- 
chief, I was WTong to al- 
lowquestionable content 
to pass. 



In response to the nega- 
tive feedback. The Com- 
municator would like 
to apologize for any un- 
professionaJ or hurtful 
content contained in the 
previous issue. 

We would also like to 
thank all of the con- 
cerned students and fac- 
ulty members who wTOte 
lo The Communicator 
in order lo point out the 
problems, and 1 would 
like lo encourage more 
interaction between 
readers and the newspa- 
per in the future. After 
all. The Communicator 
is the IPFW newspaper. 



here for students and 
faculty. 

I would also like to 
add that within 8 hours 

of the first complaint. 
The Communicator staff 
implemented corrective 
measures, in order for 
us to learn from our mis- 
takes. As students, wc 
request that it be under- 
stood that we are all still 
learning. 

Sincerely. 
Jessie Ruckman 
Editor-in-Chief, 

The Communicator 



An apology and propsal from 
"the mariciging edi'tor 



To IPFW student body 
and faculty; 

1 find myself looking 
through the last issue, 
dubbed " the hate issue". 
and I am embarrassed 
and disappointed. 

1 lake responsibility as 
a designer and slorytell- 
er for the insensitivity of 
The Communicator and 
the negative connota- 
tions with which people 
have associated ii. 
I sincerely apologize for 
those offended, both- 
ered, and or hurt by any 
content considered un- 
necessar&gt;' or distasteful. 
Whether my intentions 
were good or well thought 
out. rational, or justifi- 
able, it is important to 
recognize the emotional 



severity and potential 
consequences of such a 
defining issue, proven 
to be both controversial 
and immature. 

With that said, it may 
be safe to say that al face 
value. The Communica- 
tor was inappropriate. 

Upon looking more 
deeply at the last issue, 
I have decided to delve 
more deeply into why 
certain images or words 
are so offensive. 

If you choose to join 
me in the following is- 
sue, 1 will be exploring 
ihe chemical and bio- 
logical reaction known 
as a synapse, and its 
neurological capability 
to effect perception and 



thought. I believe if we 
understand our body's 
chemistry and psychol- 
ogy, we can further ap- 
preciate human conflict, 
controversy, and current 
issues through reason 
and respect. Our last is- 
sue, I believe, proves how 
sensitive our minds are to 
visual elements and in- 
explicable information, 
with which are concepts 
proven to be volatile in 
combination. 

Here at the Commu- 
nicator, WG find it nec- 
essary to reach towards 
and understand our di- 
verse readership, which 
through the Oct. 3 issue 
had explored the idea of a 
campus amidst change. 
IPFW is stereotyped as 



community college, 
where the priority for 
education is hindered by 
"other" responsibilities. 

Our university and its 
staff strives to comple- 
ment the lifestyles and 
culture here in Fort 
Wayne while exploring 
the potential for a vibrant 
community through 
demanded education 
and extra-curriculars. 
With new buildings, de- 
partments, and student 
housing, IPFW is moving 
fonvard and ultimately, 
changing.

Women's rights 
movement a 
fickle pendulum 

The fight for equality in society is still 
raging-from the history books to today 



By ELAINE BAKLE 

BaVlEmDIi^ipKvfdu 



Just looking back on the 
last hundred years in the 
United States, there have 
been significant chang- 
es made in the fight for 
equal rights for women. 
But, as the pendulum 
swings and social evolu- 
tion grinds slowly away, 
today's women still find 
themselves oppressed. 
The kicker is that they 
oppress 
t h e m - 
selves. 
Eliza- 



patriarchal norms and 
mores. These women 
like Abigail Adams, 
Mercy Otis Warren and 
the Livingston sisters, 
all made their feminist 
marks politically during 
the American Revolu- 
tion. 

Feminist sisters just 
kept showinguplh rough- 
out United States history. 
In 1913, 8,000 women 
marched on Washington 
to demand the right to 



"The suffragettes knew that 

in order to make important 

social change, gaining the 

right to vote was 

imperative." 



Stanton, 
Susan B. ^=^ 
Anthony 

and Alice Paul would roll 
over in their graves at 
the sight of young wom- 
en sexually exploiting 
themselves not only to 
be noticed by men, but 
to demean thetnselves in 
female on female sexual 



These women endured 
jeering from the crowds, 
criticism from other 
women and the anti- 
suffragists that claimed 
women were too pure to 
take part in politics. 

They said that women 
were too emotional and 
contact in order to give they were incapable of 
some bozo a mega boost rational decisions. Oth- 



of sexual gratification. 

There are those who be- 
lieve that this is what the 
fight for women's rights 
is about; the ability for a 
woman to do whatever 
she wants, just like a 
man. Yet, the idea hangs 
out there like a sopping 
wet shirt on a stick. 

The respect that a wom- 
an has for herself reflects 
the self confidence she 
shares with the sister- 
hood. Betray that and 
the strong links of femi- 
nism are loosened from 
within. 

The first feminists 
didn't care about sexu- 
ality and beauty. They 
just wanted the right to 
vote and to be allowed to 
become the person that 
they knew they could he. 
Really, who is to say who 
the first feminist was; 
perhaps Joan of Arc or 
Queen Elizabeth I? 

Could these women 
care about some guy's 
libido? They had a call 
and a purpose and noth- 
ing was going to stand in 
their way. 

The dehnition of a femi- 
nist is a woman who flies 
in the face of established 



ers believed women 
lo have a lack of intel- 
lect and it was better if 
their husbands voted for 
them. 

The suffragettes knew 
that in order to make im- 
portant social change, 
gaining the right to vote 
was imperative. They 
also fought for the right 
for blacks to vote. 

So, they marched, they 
protesletj, they went on 
hunger strikes while im- 
prisoned and were force 
fed, they staged parades 
until finally they won the 
right to vole in 1920. 

And it still wasn't over. 
Not everyone in the 1960s 
burned their bras, but the 
significance of the femi- 
nist struggle surfaced 
as Americans watched 
"Leave It to Beaver " and 
"Ozzie and Harriet." 

Many women realized 
that they did not want to 
vacuum in heels while 
wearing an apron and a 
string of pearls. 

They wanted what men 
had. They wanted the 
right lo be what their 
souls whispered; strong, 
intelligent, loving, and 
nurturing. And they did.

Death for sexual orientation? 

Iran's president proves that some cultures 
still deny the rights of homosexuals 



By ZACHARY HORNBACK 

harnihDISiphv.edu 



NEW YORK, Sep. 24 
-President Ahmadinejad 
made a comment dur- 
ing a forum for debate in 
which he stated, "In Iran, 
we don't have homosex- 
uals like in your country. 
We don't have that in our 
country. In Iran, we do 
not have this phenom- 
enon. ! don't know who's 
told you that we have it." 

This comment brought 
the subject of homo- 
sexuality in Iran to light 
among Americans. 

Many questioned the 
integrity of the Presi- 
dent's claim, with further 
research pointing out 
that homosexuality is 
severely discouraged in 
Iran, but not altogether 
nonexistent. 

Homosexuality itself is 
not illegal in Iran. Homo- 
sexual acts, however, are 
illegal and aie punished 
severely by the judicial 
systems. 

Sexual intercourse be- 
tween two or more men 
is punishable by death.

Sexual acts between tivo

the number of lashes giv-

to be among the worst

and my collaborator to 
push boundaries, ensur-

In closing, I apologize

James Blunt displays the beauty of simplicity 



Album Review 

By MIKE WEBB 
Mwebb01@jpfw.edu 

Who exactly is James 
Blunt? Well, odds are 
you've had the song 
"You're Beautiful" an- 
noyingly stuck in your 
head for a couple of years 
noiv. 

James Blunt more 



than likely doesn't mind 
if that song annoys you, 
because ii helped earn 
him 5 Grammy nomina- 
tions in 2006. 

Now the British sing- 
er-songwriter is back 
with "All the Lost Souls", 
and ready to prove he 
has Slaying power,

people to "Back lo Bed-

lam" is present here, but 
much more refined. 

Blunts unique voice 
and thought provoking 
lyrics are once again the 
highlights, and the mu- 
sic is there to enhance an 
emotional artistic expe- 

This can be heard on 

the acoustic version of 

the hit "1973" which is 

available (along 

^"~| \vith other extras) 

litiv for download if 

you purchase 

the disc on his 

my space page. 

Like his 
previous effort, 
there are songs 
that have very 
little going on in 
terms of inslni- 
mentation. "I Re- 
ally Want You" is 
one of the true 
highlights, and is a 
lesson in the true 
beauty of simplic- 
ity. 

He takes 



complicated concepts 
such as love and death 
and poetically represents 
them alongside music 
which sounds as if it is 
the only choice for the 
subject matter. 

If you could not 
make out any of the 
words, you 
might still 
have an idea 
of what the 
song is sup- 
posed to be 
about. 

He knows 
how to cap- 
ture the es- 
sence, and 
he does it in 
a way that 
is unique to 
him - a mark 
of a true art- 
ist. 

At times, 
the music 
can become 
intense, but 
it builds to 
that point at 



the appropriate time. 
Much effort was ob- 
viously put into giv- 
ing each song exactly 
what it needed to ac- 
complish the goal - 
nothing more, nothing 
less. 

Fans of Coldplay 



and U2 may feel right 
at home here, and his 
over-played radio-sin- 
gle doesn't overshad- 
ow the fact that he's a 
true artist.

An interview with David Gilmour 

A musical legend speaks candidly about Pink Floyd and his newest live DVD release 



By MIKE WEBB 
Mwebb01@ipfw.edu 

Where does one begin 
with a musician like Da- 
vid Gilmour? ;\longside 
his former band mates in 
Pink Floyd, he is one of the 
pioneers of psychedelic 
rock, and helped to define 
a musical age, and inllu- 
ence nearly all who would 
follow. More than 
40 years later, he 
is stilt carving out 
his legacy, and 
what a brilliant 
one it is.

The DVD features 
Giimour's "On An Island" 
solo release performed in 
its entirety, with several 
Pink Floyd clas- 
sics to round out 
the package. 




"I just

songs that were

And irust me, when 
Bowie comes onto the 
stage, you will be glad for 
the relaxation of those 
rules. This is a psychedelic 
rock fan's dream come 
true. And it's easy to see 
that everyone involved is 
having a great time. 

"I definitely enjoyed

needed lo use those sorts

it really all about the mu- 

The music (lows well. 
Any doubts about Giim- 
our's ability to retain the 
same musical spirit while 
flowing between solo and 
Pink Floyd songs vvill be 
put to rest. It becomes 
obvious thai the spirit 
heard is representative of 
Gilmour himself and not 
Ihe name of the band he 
was in at the time it was 
made. 

"It's just the way it nat- 
urally comes oui. I don't 
think that you can artifi- 
cially seek for ihe spirit 
in something and try to 
emulate it. 1 don't think 
diat really is likely to work 
or lo go anywhere." 

So with this being his 
definitive solo release, 
does this mean we will 
be seeing a revisitating of 
the band Pink Floyd any- 
where down the road? 

"I don't think that I 
want to go back to work- 
ing and writing in that 
Pink Floyd framework, 
with or without Roger 
really. It just feels lo me 
like I've been there and 
I've done thai, and that's 
a wonderful pari of my 
Ufe." 

Said Gilmour, "At some 
point in life you have to 
move on and do some- 
thing different, and try 
and satisfy your own self 
in other ways." 

Let's hope that he con- 
tinues to do just that. Any 
David Gilmour fan will 
want to get their hands on 
this release right away. It is 
an intense experience and 
will be money well spent.

one can benefit from 
those changes," Paula 
said. 

Lynda, Jennifer, and 
Paula were unsure if 
there was anything that 
IPFW could do for finan- 
cial support, but agreed 
it is something that they 
think is worth consid- 
ering. Being a not- for- 
profit childcare center 
there is little relief that 
they can offer other 
than keeping low hourly 
costs, and affordable 
preschool for students 
and faculty members. 

There is a possibility 
for more jobs, but are 
not sure if they will be 
able to allow non-stu- 
dents and non-faculty 
members to enroU there 
children. 

It seems that ev- 
eryone working at die 
center agrees ivith the 
findings that bringing 
a new program into ef- 
fect, and providing a 
bigger building seems to 
be just what IPFW needs 
to increase the overall 
quality for students who 
are parents.

A Universitj' of Florida 
football player anc^ one 
otfier UF student were 
killed in an accident at 
Old Archer Road and SW 
23rd Terrace early Friday 
morning, Gainesville Po- 
lice Department spokes- 
man Keitfi Kameg said. 

Nineteen-year-old Mi- 
ctiael Guilford, better 
known as "Sunshine" to 
his teammates, and Ash- 
ley E. Slonina, 20, died 
instantly after Guilford's 
motorcycle hit a median 
al about 12:40 a.m. 

Early reports show 
that the motorcycle was 
traveling at high rates of 
speed, Kameg said. 

Guilford was a walk-on 
redshirt freshman defen- 
sive back who also spent 
time on the scout team 
as a quarterback. He was 
a social and behavorial 
science major. Slonina 
was a political science 
major. 

KsToeg said any au- 
topsy reports could take 



several more weeks to 
determine if alcohol was 
involved. 

"We are deeply sad- 
dened to learn of the 
tragic passing of Mi- 
chael Guilford," UF 
coach Urban Meyer said

"Hewas verj' competi-

sistant Sean Cronin, who 
runs the scout team of- 
fense and was close with 
Guilford. 

"He had a fire and was 



core of that group. He 
was the heart and soul of 
our scout team." 

Cronin got a call from 
safety Curtis Carr at 4:30 
in the morning while 
sleeping, but he didn't 
call back until 6:30 to 
find out what happened. 
"1 went through a whole

Cronin said. "First il was

Then 1 just broke down

"He thanked me for

Cronin said. "I said, ' No,

Ball State Coach told to get down' 

BSU Athletic Director spoils coach's plans 



GOURIESyOF 
U-WIRE 



I State Univereit&gt;' 
's basketball coach 
Ttacy Roller said she 
would sit on a billboard 
until 1,000 season tickets 
were sold for her team. 
Tivo days after she began 
her campaign, Roller left 
the billboard but her goal 
was not met. 

Director of Intercolle- 
giate Athletics Tom Collins 
said he made the decision 
Friday to remove Roller 
from the scissor lift she 
was on by the billboard. 

"I wanted her to con- 
centrate on practice," Col- 
lins said. "I worried about 
her long term health with 
the basketball season go- 
ing on and I didn't want il 
to be a distraction for the 
Homecoming parade or 
the Homecoming football 
game." 



Roller spent Thursday 

and Friday on the lift from 
7 a.m. to 7 p.m. each day. 
She could not be reached 
for comment Sunday. 

When she left the lift Fri- 
day, Ball State Jiad sold 
more than 750 season 
tickets compared to -lO? 
last year. 

"We had a lot of very 
positive people buying 
season tickets," Collins 
said. 

"We handed out a lot of 
brochures out there. We 
exceeded the number of 
season tickets we sold last 
year, and westill got orders 
comingin. So it's been very 
positive." 

Though Collins told 
Roller to stop going on die 
lift, he said he supported 
her campaign. However, 
he did not visit her during 
her two da^-s on the lift. 

"Just tlie schedule Uiat 
I had this week with the 
events that I had to be at 
[prevented me from visit- 



ing]," he said. "I drove by 
a couple times but did not 
stop up there." 

When it was time to tell 
Roller about the decision 
to end her campaign, Col- 
lins said he could not tell 
her in person because he 
bad an appointment he 
could not break, 

"Ken Brown and Matt 
Wolfert, a couple of the 
associate ADs, went out 
to visit with her on it and 
then she and I spoke on 
the phone late in the after- 
noon," Collins said. 

Collins said Roller 
seemed disappointed 
when she heard about his 
decision. 

If she had planned the 
campaign earlier, the adi- 
letics department could 
have chosen a date ivhen 
it would not have con- 
flicted with Homecoming, 
Collins said. 

In an interview last week, 
Roller said she came up 
\vidi the promotional idea 



six months ago, though 
not in its complete form. 

"I look at it as if Home- 
coming has been planned 
for a long dme, the parade 
has been planned for a 
long dme," Collins said. 
"Again I didn't want 'IVacy 
being out there being a 
distraction for things diat 
havebeen on the books for 
seven or eight months." 

Collins said he does not 
think die decision to re- 
move Roller from the lift 
shows fevoritism to the 
football team, 

"Basketball practice had 
just started on Friday and 
I want IVacy to be healthy 
to be able to coach her 
team up," Collins said. 
"She's got all these young 
ladiescomiiigback.tliey're 
probably going to be cho- 
sen to win the West divi- 
sion in the MAC and that's 
what I want her to concen- 
trate her efforts on."

Although McSwane 
got to keep his job as 
Editor, there have been 
other repercussions to 
his actions. 

According to Brett 
Okamoto (CNN), the 
campus group called 
The College Republi- 
cans circulated a peti- 
tion that called for Mc- 
Swane to resign, and 
advertisers to pull their

money out of the pub- 
lication. 

Because of the four- 
letter debacle, the 
newspaper lost up to 
$50,000 in lost revenue 
for the paper, and 16 
advertisers pulled their 
ads. 

Since there has been 
a major debate sur- 
rounding both Colo- 
rado State University's 
newspaper as well as 
the IPFW Communi- 
cator, the heightened 
publicity has thrown 
into sharp relief the 
need to revisit The 
First Amendment and 
all that it offers publi- 
cations. 

With the priveledge of 
publishing news also 
comes responsibility 
to deliver it ethically. 
There is a fine line be- 
tween making print 
media entertaining 
and eye-catching, and 
working on the wrong 
side of the ethical line. 
University newspa- 
pers struggle daily to 
walk that line, and do it 
ethically as well.
