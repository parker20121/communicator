IPFW Club Calling 
for Student Subconscious 

&amp; SOUL 



By Kelly McLendon 

kelly.mdendaneipfvKedu 




The Soft soothing colors and hand 
drawn (lowers that decorate the walls 
of Andrea Harvey's study rouse both 
peace and tranquility. Harvey has worked 
tirelessly for the past several months to 
fashion her own brand identity, every detail 
micro-managed to ensure tliat the atmo- 
sphere she wants to arouse is produced. 

&gt; ARTIST OF THE WEEK: Page 6 



/ / Namaste." It's a common salutation 
said at the end of a yoga class. Literal- 
ly, it means "1 bow to you," according 
to Yoga Journal. Saying the phrase to 
another means you are honoring the "light" 
or spirit the other person carries. Katie Bai- 
ley, Treasurer of The IPFW Yoga Club is one 
of those people who uses the friendly greet- 
ing in everyday conversation. 

Recendy, Bailey and her sister-in-law, 
Michele Berkes-Adams, had the idea to start 
a Yoga Club on campus. Botli were working 
at the same gym when business started to 
slow down because of the economy.

"So weboth decided, independently, to go back to school 
this semester. We both have this nagging addiction to Yoga, 
so it seemed natural that we should stan the first IPFWYoga 
Club so we can get our "fix, " Berkes-Adams said. 

For Bailey, teaching others yoga is a way of Ufe. 

"My favorite aspect of yoga is sharing it with others. I 
feel a calling lo help other people experience themselves 
and their mind/body connection." she said. 

Bailey is quick to acknowledge, however, that "I'm not 
any kind of guru or experi. I am learning too. Yoga is a jour- 
ney, not a destination. We are all in our own places in our 
own journeys, and we are all learning together." 

There is no competition in yoga. It is not a sport where 
lliere is rivalry. It is about establishing a solid connection 
between die mind and the body, which may help with 
physical and emotional ailments. 

Berkes-Adams likes to emphasize how much yoga can ben- 
efit the body. 

"Yoga is great for stress reLef, physical health and spiri- 
tual health. The focus on breathing, meditation, and learn- 
ing about and accepting our true selves adds a whole other 
dimension to the practice." she said. 
The club plans to offer weekly meetings where they will 
practice yoga, as well as discuss the yogic lifestyle. They also 
hope to have special events and workshops as the group ex- 
pands. 

During the mon tli of April, the club vdll be holding a free 
Yoga class every Saturday in CM B16. 
"We hope to draw m people who have never done yoga, 
don't think they can do it, or have misconceptions of hav- 
ing to be a certain gender, or young and flexible to do yoga," 
Bailey said. 



2nd Annual Sociology Awareness Week 

An E S C cip 6 from the 

Q-^Fort Wayne 

Bubble 





By Katy Anderson 

kalhryn.andcnaneiphN.edu 

Thesecond annual Sociology Awareness Week 
will be taking place next week and hopes to help 
students escape from the "Fort Wayne Bubble." 

This week intends to raise awareness of so- 
ciology as a study and it's applicability in every- 
one's life. lanelle Nannini is an IPFW smdeni and 
advisor the iPFW Sociology Student Association. 
She along with the executive officers of SSA initi- 
ated Sociology Awareness Week last year. 

"We get so engrossed in school and all our 
responsibilities that sometimes you have to stop 
and look outside of your normal view and take in 
the world around," said Nannini. 

On Monday there ivill be a lunch seminar on 
criminology', criminal justice, and the study of 
deviance. 

Antonia luhasz will be 
speaking on Tbesday. She 
is a policy- analyst, author, 
and activist living in San 
Francisco who is part of 
the Global Exchange in 
San Francisco, California. 
Her latest book is called 
"The Tyranny of Oil" and 
she will be giving a speech, 
taking questions, and par- 
ticipating in a meet and 




greet reception. 

Earth Day is on Wednesday and will be the 
highlight of the week, according lo Nannini. 
There will be activities taking place on the sci- 
ence mall or indoors in the Walb lobby if there is 
rain. There, students can make easy pledge com- 
mitments to help the environment. 
"It shows how if just the students at IPFW did 
these things how much of an environmental im- 
pact we could have," Nannini said. 

There will also be local vendors and resources 
that have an environmental theme or mission. 
If people visit three tables they get a free lunch. 
Students must have stamp cards before they can 
get food. 

On Thursday there will b a showing of Milk 
and then a discussion afterwards about local im- 
plications and ideas for activism for support. 

Friday is called "Celebration of Sociology" 
and will feature presentations by sociology un- 
dergraduates and graduate students and faculty. 
They will present work they are doing or have re- 
cently completed that has put IPFW on the "so- 
ciological radar," according to Nannini. 

"I've found over and over that students dis- 
cover fantastic things in their education but then 
there's the question, "what can I do with this?'" 
Nannini said, "Each of these events will show- 
case something that we, IPFW students, can do 
lo make a difference in the world and the lives 
around them."

Election Week Cast Aways 

Hundreds of students line up to vote, most still unaware of issues 



By Kim Coffey 

liim.toHey©ipfwcornfriu n i ca i or org 

While hundreds of students stand 
in line to receive free food and t-shirts, 
they are reminded to cast their vote. 
Student Elections started Monday and 
will continue !0 run through Saturday 
the 18th. Various flyers and yard signs 
have become more prevalent on cam- 
pus, displaying the names of candi- 
dates and their desired positions. 

Despite the effons of both nmning 
candidates and the IPSGA, many stu- 
dents feel very ill informed about those 
who wish to represent them for the up- 
coming school year. 

Michael Metzler, a freshman at 
IPFW, said thai he would be voting- but 
only in the hopes to support a friend. 
When asked if he felt informed about 
the election Metzler simply shook his 
head and laughed. 

Junior Kevin Eubanks will also be 
voting for people he is personally fa- 
miliar i\ith. The reason being, "I have 
no idea what anybody's platform is... 
I have no information about what 
they're doing to improve our campus," 
Linda Vaske, who feels that she is only 
somewhat informed on the candidates 
and their positions, insisted thai she 
would definitely be voting "because it's 
my duty." 

VVTiile there are members of the stu- 
dent body who are aware of the elec- 
tion and voting times. Ihcre are others 
who have been left in the dark. When 
asked if she would be voting, sopho- 
more Kacy Bonham responded with, 
"What am I voting for?" 

Communication's instructor Laura 



Smitiey was also confused. "I didn't 
know iheie were elections today." 

Voting for this past Monday was 
originally scheduled to take place at 
the Science Mall, but was moved to 
the Walb Ballroom due to weather. Of 
the small amount of students that did 
show up to participate in IPFW's kick 
off of "Spring Fling", many participated 



in voting for various reasons. 

A few students came to kill time be- 
tween classes and vote while they had 
the opponunity. Others thought that 
they were required to vole before they 
could receive free pizza. Many cast 
their votes for candidates they knew 
on a personal level. Some decided last 
minute based on which candidate they 



last talked to. One student even admit- 
ted to picking the candidates with the 
"coolest last names." 

While Spring Fling and voting con- 
tinues throughout the rest of the week. 
Sophomore Kacy Bonham probably 
sums up the mindset of most students, 
"If I do vote it'll be to get free pizza."

Student Investing 101 

By Jessie Ruckman 

jessie.ruckman@ipfwcommunicator.org 

Everything about American culture today is about 
speed. Gel rich quick, get through school even faster, 
and then buy everything you can get your hands on 
regardless of cosi. Unfortunately, the people you see 
wandering around covered with jewelry and driving 
expensive cars are probably in debt up to their eye- 
balls. 

Having grown up in a family of poor money man- 
agers, I can tell you that mismanaging your money 
can be detrimenial, and won't only affect your bot-

torn line, but it can affect relationships as well. 

So, how do college students get ahead? First, and 
this is important so pay attention: don't buy things 
you can't afford. Everyone ivanls to appear as though 
they have everything they want - it's just the culture 
we live in to want these things. People don't save up 
for things anymore; tbey simply put it on credit and 
swear that they will pay Items off before the interest 
gets out of hand. That doesn't happen, I'm sorry to 
report. 

Second, make a bud- 
get. You know roughly 
how much money you 
bring home in a given 
month; if you are in the 
serving industry and 
work off of tips, you can 
still figure a ballpark esti- 
mate. 

According to htip;// 
geirichslowly.org, "(A 
budget plan] doesn't have 
to be fancy. At the start of 
the month, estimate how 
much money you'll re- 
ceive and decide where 
needs to go. Remember: 
you don't need to spend 
it all." Imagine that - at 
the end of the month. 



b^'iggerttoyoflrj, 



you coiJd actually have money left over, if you watch 
whereyourmoney's going- better yet, not going. 

Third, don't get a credit card unless you absolutely 
have to. Use your debit card, and track your expenses 
either by writing down expenditures, or by printing 
off an online statement. Credit cards are not a college 
student's friend in the long run - banks or companies 
want to make money off of your sloppy spending 
habits govern crecht cards, and they make a killing on 
overdraft and late fees. 

Best idea: don't get a credit card unless you are 
disciplined enough to keep it paid off at the end of 
every month. 

Credit cards can help to boost your credit score, 
but only if you treat them like cash. Say you want to 
purchase a new iPod Touch (about 300 dollars). Sure, 
put the expense on your Visa, but only if you have 
cash to pay off thai debt immediately. Then (and 
here's the key, kids) actually pay that debt off imme- 
diately before your genius self decides that you have 
a better purpose for that cash. Be disciplined, and 
in the long run you'll thank yourself (and me) for not 
drowning in debt. 

Bottom line: use your money wisely, and don't 
worry about keeping up with the person who sits 
next to you in class - all of the jewelry and expensive 
clothing probably isn't paid for, and it will be really 
embarrassing for them when the bank literally takes 
the shirt off their back.

One year later, investigator stili blames students 
for slain IPFW student, witnesses but no arrests 



By Dan Jehl 

d3n.JFlheiplw.edu 

The date was April 6. 2008. IPFW 
student Fred Jones went to an off-cam- 
pus party with more than 50 others. A 
fight emipted and someone shot the 
wrong guy. Jones didn't survive. One 
year later, nobody has been arrested. 

"Fred Jones was a well-liked guy 
and was an innocent bystander," said 
Detective Lorna Russell, Fort Wayne 
Detective assigned to this case. 

Russell was "on call" when the call 
came about a shooting around the 
IPFW campus last spring. Russell took 
that call and has been the lead inves- 
tigator on the Fred Jones case to this 
day. 

Russell provided The Communica- 
tor a one-year anniversary update on 
the case. Cutting to the chase — some 
progress but not enough for an arrest 
yet. 

Russell's frustration about the case 
not being solved is directed at the stu- 
dents and anyone who attended the 
party and have not stepped forward. 

After four months of investigating 
the case, Russell said, "we need the stu- 
dents to be responsible. They are not 
cooperating and they know something. 
There were 50 to 60 people around that 

Hana's Thoughts 

By Hana Al-Hawash 

h3na.hawash@ipfwcotiimunJcator.org 

Falling for the BFF 

Q. I am starting to fall for my best 
friend, and I am not sure if this is a 
mistake or not. What should I do? 

A. The best fi-iend forever {BFF) 
is the person that is always diere, 
makes us laugh, makes us feel bet- 
ter, cares for us and so on. In one's 
mind, one's best ftiendis the perfect 
g^iyorgirl. 

As German scholar and philoso- 
pher Friedrich Nietzsche once said, 
"The best friend will probably ac- 
quire the best ivife, because a good 
marriage is founded on the talent 
for friendship" 

Though best fiends can always 
have romaniic relationships that go 
incredibly smooth, they can some- 
times go terribly wrong. 

While talking to a peer about her 
relationship with her best friend, 
she said, "at first, the idea seems 
perfect, you have so much in com- 
mon with your best friend, but if 
things go wrong your ex and best 
friend will not support your new 
partners. I have actually had a best 
friend who I had dated tell me ev- 
erything wrong about the guy 1 was 
interested in and point out all the 
flaws he knew I did not like. Once 
you date someone you can not look 
at them the same way- the relation- 
ship and connection changes and 
sometimes that change is not for 



party and it was a small apartment. 
They need to come forward and be re- 
sponsible." 

Now Russell tells more about these 
"50 to 60 people." She says, "1 have a 
couple of witnesses, but I need more." 

"We know there are more out (here, 
and we are still waiting," said Russell. 
Russell concedes it's getting harder to 
find ivitnesses and urges anyone who 
knows anything to call the anonymous 
Crime-Stoppers number at 436-STOP 

Russell says, "the problem is that 
several of the witnesses no longer go 
to IPFW since they dropped out and 
several were high school students from 
other counties who attended the par- 
ty." Russell said several are still on the 
campus. 

Last year, Russell eicpressed her view 
on the possible witnesses at the party: 
"Maybe they're afraid of snitching. But 
they can come fonvard anonymously. 
That's simply irresponsible. After all, 
Fred was an innocent classmate, a vic- 
tim, and they should want to help." 
Russell said, "We have concrete leads, 
but need the cooperation of the stu- 
dents or anyone who knows something 
to do anything." 

This case is not going away. Russell 
said, "this case will remain open until it 
is solved." 




the best." 

1 know of a couple who started 
out as best friends and ended up 
married. They are the perfect cou- 
ple - they are open with each other 
and are better able to accept each 
other's flaws because they were so 
close before the relationship turned 
romantic. 

Before you drop the 'like bomb,' 
explain why you think the relation- 
ship would work and why you like 
them. Talk it out. 

if this is not enough to convince 
the oilier person, then do not be of- 
fended if they turn you down. This 
is probably because they either like 
someone else and still see you as 
the best friend, or they just do not 
want to ruin the relationship as it 
is and are afraid they vvlll. The only 
thing you can really do Is put your- 
self out there and hope your friend 
wiL either like you back, or be nice 
about it.

Letter to the Editor 

Cafeteria, another food 
choice on campus, please? 



Subway, Pizza Hutt, and Taco Bell 
are the only food choices on cam- 
pus. They may sound appetizing, but 
if someone goes to school five days a 
week and only has those three options 
for lunch, it becomes a nuisance. IPFW 
may be getting big enough to have a 
cafeteria buffet. 

Most universities have a cafete- 
ria buffet for their students and even 
for the public. Students pay for these 
meals with points on a point card that 
the university supplies them with. Each 
student would gel as many points as 
needed for theyear.The point card is in- 
cluded with tuition and isalot cheaper 
than buying a meal from one of the cur- 
rent three fast food restaurants options 
on campus. Every student has a choice 
to buy points or not, so 
the students who do not 
eat on campus would not 
have to get a point card. 

Not only do the stu- 
dents benefit from a caf- 
eteria buffet but the pub- 
lic do as well. Purdue's 
cafeteria buffet costs 
seven dollars per meal if 
someone does not have 
a point card. It can act as 
a restaurant for the pub- 
lic. This would also help 



bringing in money for the university. 

There is a lot of significance to the 
cafeteria buffet. Students would have a 
bigger variety of food and get to choose 
what they really want to eat. If a student 
wants more than one thing or a little hit 
of everything they can have it with just 
one meal cost. 

The cafeteria buffet would also be 
more cost efficient for the students. 
This would really help relieve some of 
the stress because the average student 
at IPFW works and goes to school - 
anything that would save money would 
help them tremendously.

'Holy Grail' student exhibition 
embodies Remnant Trust at IPFW 

By Said EL-Dajani 

^ (anlacieipVcornmuiiicalor.arg 

lijddcii in the underbelly of IPFW's Visual Arts Building, al- 
' most shafted by the aiiention and demanding space of the se- 
nior B.F.A. fine arts exhibit, is the "Holy Grail." 

Headed by advanced metalsmithing's Robert Shroeder and 
professor of advanced drawing's Audrey Ushenko is an embody- 
ing extension of die Remnant trust at IPPA'. 

The class project, in collaboration with University Relations 
had lis opening reception concurrent with the fine arts exhibi- 
tion on I'riday, April 3, drawing in a couple hundred people. 

The students were assigned an expedition into translation. 
Their search of the Holy Grail was a metaphorical voyage to ex- 
plore ideas rather than something tangible. 

"I was .surprised that everybody didn't just make a cup. I was . 
expecting a bunch of goblets or chalices." said Shroeder. "That 
they would take it literally. But they didn't." 

In conjunction with the Remnant THist exhibition located in 
the Heimke Library, the students were responsible for submit- 
ting a design plan fora work of art that in some ways embodies 
the idea of a text from this important collection of documents. 

"The level of work that came out of diis was really great, " 
Shroeder said. " No one really skipped class and having the show 
was incentive. This is resume work - this is official."

JAndrea Harvey 

Artist of the Week 



By Peter Schnellenberger 



Harvey is a senior, graphic design major, graduating with a 
Bachelors in Fine Arts from IPFW this May Her final project en- 
titled "Green Bird" went on display Friday April 10, al thejeffery 
R. Krull Gallery In the Allen County Public Library. Harvey took 
home three awards for her work, I^irst Place in Graphic Design, 
Excellence in Graphic Design and Outstanding Senior. 

Harvey was the driving force behind the promotional art for 
this show. She worked alongside fellow graphic designers, Erika 
Coffing (whom W9^;3Js.O avyarriqd Jf^n^ ^g pff jf^ f i fffp hir: Dgygt;^ 



and Brooke Francesi (whom won Best in Show) and humbly gave 
recognition to the graduating Seniors and expressed her appre- 
ciation for the staff and faculty of the Department of Visual Com- 
munication and Design. 

The idea behind Harvey's design is "a return to hand crafted 
home decor," Harvey said that she feels people are trying to gel 
away from the giant superstores-such as Walmart- and return to 
a type decoration that is more personal and special, "To create 
an environment where someone would feel at home in. where 
they feel could surround themselves in something that no one 
else would have." 

The most important part her work is color. 'I really try to cre- 
ate something that has a lot of negative space with a vibrant fo- 
cus of color. I feel that's a common thread amongst my work." 
said Harvey. The colors and shades that she used in this proj- 
Luim of her brand identity. It's what.

allowed her to create ihe sense of peace and coziness that she 
sought to generate. 

Unlike many other artists at IPFW, Harvey is a weary about 
her future because of the current economic crisis. Her work is 
naturally going to have a higher price lag, than some of her com- 
petitor s work - such as Wal-Mart and Menards- because of the 
inability to mass produce her work. 

One of the difficulties Harvey had working on the project was 
coordinating ail the various, pieces into one cohesive whole, if 
all the pieces don't match right, or if something is missing then 
the all around feel will ruined, and the purpose of the project 
(and graphic design in general) will have failed. 

Harvey learned something vital about herself throughout die 
process of this final project. She learned that in her heart - of- 
hearts she is a "girly-girl", a totally foreign concept from how she 
used to see herself. 

Harvey has gained a deep appreciation for IPFW throughout 
the years; initially she decided to attend the University for "pure- 
ly financial reasons". Then she decided to become an art major, 
something that she might not have been able to do at a different 
university, because of the open door policy. At IPFW, someone 
doesn't need experience in the arts field to be accepted into the 
department. 

Harvey's artistic talents stretch beyond that of the realm 
graphic design. She is also a vocalist in two different bands: 
Wooden Satellites and Lee Miles and the Illegilimate Sons. She 
performs alongside her husband, C. Ray Harvey, English major 
at IPFW. 

After graduation Harvey wants to find a full time job, and 
hopes to take what she did with her senior project and turn it 
4nto-a«ide.pi:oject&gt; perhaps even a.side. business all its own.

Baseball belted by Butler, Southern Utah 



Bulldogs use eight run 7th inning to pull away; Summit 
League staying unfriendly as Southern Utah takes four games 



By Monica Gerdeman 

mo n I ca .ge rdc m an@ ipfw comm u n I ca I G r. [ 

Usually in baseball, It's three strikes 
and you're out. But the Mastodons 
went for five, playing a heavy schedule 
this past week. Wednesday, Butler 
traveled to to^vn for a one game 
wonder, lopping IPFW 18-7. Senior 
Chris Goitschall took a trot all the way 
around the bases in the bottom of the 
first, hitting his fourth homer of the 
season. The effort wasn't a total loss as 
the team finished with 11 hits and six 
RBI. but Butler ended with a whopping 
16 hits and a 17 in the RBI column. 

Southern Utah Thunderbirds didn't 
mind nibbling on the Mastodons 
during the weekend, as they gulped 
up the 'Dons in all four of the inner- 
conference series games. Friday's 
battle was postponed on account of 
weather, which may have been a good 
thing for IPFW. 

In the first of two on Saturday 
afternoon, Southern Utah took IPFW 
by storm and ended it a shutout 7-0. 

In the second game, IPFW was able 
to pull a few across the plate as junior 
right fielder Joel Washko went three of 
five with an RBI and finished with five 
hits in the double header However, 



Southern Utah stayed strong in the 1 1- 
6 win.

the results

right 

but we 

know we 

need to 

focus on 

getting 

better and playing the game one pitch 

at a time," commented Washko. 

The third game was another one of 
Thunderblrd's shutouts. IPFW ended 
with five hits but couldn't put any ruii^ 
across home, falling 4-0. 

"The pitchers we faced in gameii 
one and three threw quite well. That's 
where we always seem to face people at 
their best, that and the cold weather." 
said head coach Bobby Pierce. " We 
went into almost a panic mode instead 
of trying to let the games come to us. 
When you're down like that and finally 
realize it, it's a bad recipe for a win." 

Because of a knee injury to first 
baseman Shaun VanDriessche, 
Gottschall, the usual shortstop, moved

IPFW Rugby dub prepares 
for next game on April 18 



By Dan Vance 

elpFwcommunicalDr.org 



This Saturday, the 
IPFW Rugby club will be 
playing their next game. 
a home event against 
Purdue University. The 
game i,vill be played at 1 
p.m. at McMillan Park. 

Founded during the 
2007-2008 school year by 
former president Chris 
Porter, the club has been 
travelling quite a bit this 
yearandrecentlydefeated 
Eastern Kentucky at a 
tournament in Nashville, 
Tennessee. In the same 
tournament, they fell to 
North Dakota. 

Brandon Ringeisen, 
the vice president of the 
club and co-captain of 
the team, says that the 
game is quite popular 
throughout the Fort 
Wayne area. 

"More people are 
familiar with it so we can 
gel help with coaching 
and stuff," Ringeisen 
said. 

In addition to his 
participation with IPFW, 
Ringeisen also plays 
for the Fort Wayne city 
rugby team and helps 
out at Carroll High 
School. Several local high

Kalamazoo, will play Purdue this Saturday. 



schools, like Carroll, have 
rugby clubs according to 
Ringeisen. 

Ringeisen himself did 
not pick up rugby until 
he joined the team last 
school year. 

"I really didn't know 
much at all but it was 
really easy to pick up 
after playing a couple of 
games," Ringeisen said. 

Following the April 18 
event, the team ivill travel 
to Muncie for an April 25 
game with Ball Stale. 

The team travels more 
often than not, though 
they don't get funding 
from the university for 
most of their trips. The 
school did help pay for 
the trip to Nashville. 

The team also got the 
chance to playin the snow 



during a trip this winter 
to Kalamazoo, Michigan. 
Ringeisen says that was 
one of his favorite games 
because the snow made 
everything more relaxed. 

The club, run by 
president Brock Walter, 
Ringeisen and treasurer 
Chris Phillips, is always 
looking for more people 
who are interested. In 
addition, they would 
always like more fans to 
come out and share in 
the experience. 

"It's like football 
but more fast paced," 
Ringeisen said. "You 
don't have to sit there 
and wait for something 
to happen. If you aren't 
paying attention, you'U 
miss half the game 
basically."

improving the score to 3-5. By the end "It was really a make or break 

of the fifth, the 'Dons tied the game 5- weekend, but there still is an

ofthe seventh, allowing smooth sailing place going into (the Summit League) 

for the Thunderbirds from there in tournament," Pierce finished.

^TV^^m. ^^°^^ ^^^^ another coach gone amidst last place finish for Ants 




By Dan Vance 

dan.vanceSipfwcommunic^Tot.oig 

During the past month, DeWitt 
Scott has been telling the story of his 
basketball career in the pages of The 
Communicator. The former IPFW 
basketball player made strong note 
durin this time of the many coaching 
changes he has gone through during 
his career. 

"I actually thought, 'I must be a 
curse. Everywhere I go, my coaches 
get fired,'" Scott said in PartlXvoof the 
"Finding Witt ivith Wisdom" series. 

Scott went through coaching 
changes in high school and three times 
on the college level. 



That tale was added to on Saturday 
nighi, when Fort Wayne Mad Ants 
coach laren Jackson resigned just hours 
after the team's season Rnale, a 123-89 
loss to the Erie Bayhawks. 

"It seems like it has hit again," Scott 
half-joked on Tuesday. "But it's a little 
different this lime because he resigned. 
1 really like coach fackson, he's a great 

guy-" 

Jackson left after the Mad Anls' 
second straight last place finish in the 
NBDL's Central Division. This year, the 
team was 19-31. 

Despite having two NBDL All-Stars 
in Walker Russell Jr. and Chris Hunter, 
the team was unsuccessful late in game, 
often giving up big leads. 



Scott played in 49 games in his debut 
season with the Mad Ants, averaging 
7.9 points in just under 28 minutes per 
game. He scored 10 points in the season 
ending loss. 

"For the first time. I got to see what 
it was like to play basketball as a job." 
Scott said. 

While Scott will be keeping his 
options open for next season for the 
lime, he does say that this coaching 
change will not sway his desire to spend 
more time as a Mad Ant. 

"Coach Jackson and his staff were 
very helpful, but I Lke the whole 
organization," Scott said. "At the end of 
the day, it was one of the greatest years 
of my life." 



A second shot at success 

■ Four year IPFW volleyball player Jessica Miller is using her final semester to get another opportunity with Track and Field 



By Monica Gerdeman 

m n ica .g c td c man e ip fwto mmu n i ca to 1 01 g 

According to the National Center 
for Health Statistics, the average 
height for an adult female in the 
United States is 5 feet, 3.8 inches. 
Senior volleyball player Jessica Miller 
lowers above average at 6'!"; and far 
from standard when it comes down 
10 being a college atlilete. 

"We had been looking at Jessica 
eversincejunior high to come play for 
us. We sent her consistent messages 
about pla^dng, and in the end she 
knew IPFW was the best choice for 
her," commented head volleyball 
coach Kelly Hartley- Hution. 

That was the start of a four 
year commitment to the women's 
volleyball team for lessica Miller. 
Bui how did her name end up on the 
track roster? 

Head track and field coach Mike 
Fruchey talked to Hartley about 
Miller throwing for the track team 
during her freshman year, because 
he too was looking at Miller to come 
to IPFW. 

"When Jess gives her word, it's 
always a for sure commitment. Since 
she had already signed on board with 
the volleyball team, I didn't see her 
breaking that commitment." said 
Hartley- Button. 

Miller stuck to her word and 
finished all four years of IPFW 
volleyball. During Miller's senior 
season in the fall, she was named 
the league's Player of the Week and 
was placed on the Summit League 



Commissioner's List of Excellence. 
Twice in 2006, she was named to All- 
Tournament teams and the list of 
achievements go on. Miller finished 
her IPFW career fourth overall in kills 
ivith 1,000. ninth with 61 servies aces 
and with 245 blocks completed at 
seventh. 

"Jess is the dean's list type. She 
doesn't warn personal glory but is all 
about the team. She does the work 
day in and day out, and I actually did 
Jess a favor and bought her an extra 
jersey in each color. I didn't want 
her work to show up on her jersey so 
much. I can see why any coach would 
want her," said Hartley- Hulton. 

Coach Fruchey approached Miller 
again as her senior volleyball season 
came to an end and once again asked 
her to join the track and field team. 
Miller finally agreed to throw discus 
and javelin for Fruchey. 

"In high school I came really close 
to breaking our record, so I looked at 
the records here and saw that they 
were close to what i was throwing 
in high school. I never thought that 
1 would get the opportunity to throw 
again and I realized this was my 
second chance." claimed Miller. 

In the most recent results from 
the Oxford meet at Miami of Ohio 
on April II, Miller placed among 
the top 15 throwing 29.49 meters in 
javelin and 28.49 meters in disc. The 
competes this weekend in Lafayette. 

Miller explained the hardest thing 
about picking up two sports in college 
is time management. 

"Try not to over load yourself. 
Ultimately in college people think

Volleyball runs out of gas 

■ Mastodons hold lead twice over MIVA rival Ball state, can't finish off Cardinals late HOITIB DltlJ IGI 



By Dan Vance 

dan.vancteiptwcanununlcator.Dig 



Despite leading 1-0 and 2-1, the Mastodons ran 
out of steam late in Saturday's final home match and 
fell to visiting Ball State 3-2 (30-27. 26-30. 30-26, 16- 
30, 12-15). The event was also Senior Night for the 
team and a "Blue Out" to raise awareness for prostate 
cancer, with 915 people in attendance. 

Even in the defeat, the Mastodons out hit the 
Cardinals .296 to .273, dug out more balls (51-49) and 
also outblocked their opponent 1 7- 13. 

IPFW took their first game one lead and stretched 
it to 10-7. From there, they never trailed, powered 
by the hitting of Ben Duckworth and Darryl Shank. 
Duckworth ended game one with one of his career 
best 27 kills. IPFW led only once in game two but a 
service ace by Todd Chamberlain gave Ball State a 1 7- 
16 lead, one they never let go of. 

The third game was the key for the Mastodons, 
who ralhed strong mid-game off the I. J. Meyer serve 
after trailing 14-9. After an extensive back and forth 
campaign, IPFW pulled ahead for good in game three 
at 24-23. 

"J.J. has been a huge spark for us all season. It 
seems he changes the game for us everyiime he gets 
in," said senior Mike Morici. 

The team came out sluggish in game four and 
didn't show many signs of life until they already 
trailed 10-2. A back and forth final game went arye on 
a luckj' bounce for Ball State off the rafters, helping 
them put away the 15- 12 win. 

"I'm not sure if we ran out of energy or what," 
Morici said of games four and five. "We got off to a 
really slow start and just couldn't get back in the 
rhythm of things." 

In his final home appearance, after debuting 
in 2005, Morici was all over the court in the match. 
diving and flipping after stray hits. Morici dug up 
eight balls on the night. 

"I definitely felt like the old me," Morici noted. 
"The hype of it being Senior Night and the fact that we 
were placing Ball Slate made me want to win so bad. 
I was more than willing to throw my body around to 
dig anything [ could." 

Shank chipped in 1 7 kills while Oliver Kook added 
nine. On defense, Nathaniel Berg had eight block 
assists while Shank had six and one solo block. On the 
dig end, everyone chipped in- led by Duckworth's 
nine; Shank and Corey Stewart each added eight. 
Stewart put up a career high 55 assists.

Book on Lloy Ball gives unrivaled insight 



In All Directions 

By Dan Vance 

vance-iad.blogspot.com 

Sports biographies are not a 
rare thing these days, but to find 
one of relevance on a local level is. 

Published in late November 
by AuihorHouse, "The Biggest 
Mistake I Never Made" tells a 
unique and interesting tale of 
former IPFW volleyball sensation 
Lloy Ball, in his own words, as 
told to News Sentinel sports writer 
Blake Sebring. 

The lagline on the front cover 
of the book really does no justice 
in summing up liiis tale: "How an 
Indiana boy gave up basketball lo 
become a world-class volleyball 
player." 

I really enjoy that Ball and 
Sebringdid not rush alongthe story, 
taking plenty of time throughout 
the 188 pages to transition from 
event to event. Even the tale of 
Uoy choosing between playing 



Division 1 basketball at Indiana 
Unlversitj' and coming here to 
IPFW to play volleyball for his 
father is not rushed and starts 
mainly in chapter six. 

Chapter one discusses the 
Ball family and 
then the tale 
goes forward into 
some Team USA 
stories before 
delving back into 
Lloy's life and 
moving forward 
chronologically. 

One of my 
favorite parts 
of the entire 
book however 
comes in that 
afformentioned 
chapter six where Ball talks about 
the first time he told his father, 
legendary IPFW coach Arnie, thai 
he was coming to IPFW. 

In Lloy's words, after he told 
his father he was going to play 
at IPFW, just before the press 




conference where he would 
announce the same lo the rest of 
his communitj', Ball says this of 
his father's reaction: 

"It was awkward but he didn't 
say anything. He just nodded his 
head." 

This is one of my 
favorite lines, in part 
from knowing Arnie 
and that general Arnie 
Ball reaction. 

Reading Lloy's 

insights on his entire 
storied volleyball 

career is great. From 
the first practice of 
his IPFW career to the 
gold medal ceremony 
of the 2008 Olympic 
Games, the whole story 
is beautifully illustrated by a guy 
who has been through so much. 

The book is available in local 
bookstores for SI 7.50 and also 
online. If you are a fan of local 
sports, Lloy or Arnie Ball, it is a 
must have for your collection.
