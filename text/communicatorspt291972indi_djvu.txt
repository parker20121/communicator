September 29, 1972 



campaigns 
at Indiana - Purdue 



Republican candidate for 
govenor, Ocis Bowen, tour- 
ing the I-PU campus as part 
of a campaign trip to Fon 
Wayne, handshook his way 
through the lounge and caf- 
eteria In an effort to intro- 
duce himself to potential 
supporters, 

Bowen, who has served for 
six years as the Speaker of 
the Indiana General Assem- 
bly's House of Representa- 
tives, spent an hour in In- 
formal meetings with stu- 
dents before addressing 
himself to current cam- 
paign topics in an Interview 
, with the Communicator. 

Touching upon the question 
of 18-year-old majority 
rights, Bowen refuted any 
claims that he has not fa- 



vored granting full rights 
to 18 year olds. His posi- 
tion on the issue, he stated. 
Is one of support since he 
believes that any individual 
who Is of military age and 
who is permitted to vote 
should be considered an a- 
dult in other respects as 
well. "I don't see how one 
can be considered an adult 
for one thing and not an- 
other," he commented. The 
fact that he himself did not 
vote for the bill, Bowen not- 
ed, is explained by the fact 
chat as Speaker of the House 
he Is not required to vote 
unless his vote is required 
to break a deadlock.

Scene from 'Virginia Woolf' 



Bowen campaigns... 

{Cont. from page 1 

The overwhelming prob- 
lem facing the state in 1973, 
according to Bowen, ispro- 
perty tax relief. There isa 
need "to restructure the tax 
system so as to remove ut- 
ter dependency upon the 
property tax, expeclally as 
it concerns financing of 
public education. Owner- 
ship of property is no long- 
er a measure of a man's 
ability to flnancepublic ed- 
ucation." 

Asked why the state legis- 
lature had not accomplished 
anything In regard to pro- 
perty tax rellefpreviously, 
Bowen pointed out that un- 
der his tenure as Speaker 
of the House, attempts were 
made to Implement tax re- 
lief programs In 1969,1971, 
and 1972, but were stymied 
by actions of the state Se- 
nate and the govenor. 

"As Speaker," hedeclar- 
ed, "I have done everything 
possible to get it(tax relief) 
accomplished. (But there 
was) "an honest difference 
of opinion between me and 
the executive branch. I be- 
lieve that people recognize 
my position on this impor- 
tant problem Is right or I 
would not have been nom- 
inated rather handily at the 
Convention." 

In addition to the tax sit- 
uation. Bowen cited areas 
of education, road building 
and impr vem ent s and 
highway safety, health and 
welfare, social problems 
(such as crime, delinquen- 
cy, and drugs) and Consti- 
tutional reformasdemand- 
ing further state attention. 
To aid in the moderniza- 
tion of the state correct- 



ional system, he would 
stress the rehabilitation of 
criminals. "Not being 
soft," he hastened to add, 
but rather being "fair but 
firm." Rehabilitation could 
include medical treatment 
in the form of physical and 
mental health programs as 
well as educational pro- 
grams to prepare former 
convicts for a return to so- 
ciety. 

Some of the plusses of his 
term as Speaker, Bowen 

helped to formulate and 
guide through the House. Of 
particular Interest are 
pieces of legislation 
creating a state Com- 
mission of Higher Educa- 
tion, establishing a Drug 
Abuse Division of the State 
Board of Health and an En- 
vironmental Control De- 
partment under the same 
department, and the initia- 
tion of a state Medical Ed- 
ucation Program. However, 
he recalled, one of the most 
important roles he has per- 
formed Is in the position of 
the "Champion of tax re- 
form to get a balanced tax 

system with much less de- 
pendence upon the property 
tax." 

To conclude the Interview, 
Bowen brief ly described 
his opposition to the legai- 
Izatlon of marijuana. 
"There Is no way that I will 
support the legalization or 
decriminalization of mari- 
juana. It is a drug and If its 
use is increased by OK-Ing 
It's use, then we're going 
to compound problems that 
result from anotherdrug 
already in use — alcohal.

A COMMENTARY

Ed. plan to be released 



Why is zoning sacred? 



An issue of potential controversy surrounds the recent 
decision of the Fort Wayne Plan Commission to axe 
the home business of Mrs. Wilma Geschwell of 158 
East State Blvd. It seems that Mrs. Geschwell's beauty 
shop Is the only source of- revenue for herself and her 
son, as she is a divorcee. However, as the zoning laws 
stand, she Is forced to liquidate her business because 
that area is part of a so-called high residential area. 
It apparently does not matter that she will be forced 
to find some other means of livelihoodi, nor does it 
matter that she Is not the only zoning violator. 

This issue brings to bear many questions concerning 
not only the specific manner of zoning enforcement but 
the entire issue of the necessity of zoning. Why is zoning 
such a sacred thing that almost all towns and cities cry 
when even questions are raised against zoning? Zoning 
laws do not mean that a better city will be the result. 
Houston, Texas, which has no zoning laws when com- 
pared to Fort Wayne, Is just as clean and easy to get 
around in as Fort Wayne. When compared to Fort Wayne, 
(Houston has over two million population, Fort Wayne 
less than 200 thousand) one Is hard pressed to say zoning 
is better than non-zoning. 

Maybe we should revamp our laws and try to arrive 
at a solution which would allow residential businesses 
without creating added problems. Unless, of course, 
zoning is equated with the existence of God? But then, 
even that doesn't seem to be sacred. 

Enrollment drops in FWCS 

The Fort Wayne Community Schools announced that for 
the first time In 25 years, enrollment for grades 1-6 
dropped from the previous year. The total was down 
by more than 450 pupils. However, the high schools 
increased slightly and the kindergartens remained about 
the same. 

Franlcs murder case moved 

The murder case of Paul Eugene Franks has received 
■a' change of venue and been moved to Porter County. 
Franks, facing *two murder charges, one from 1970, the 
other from 1965. His attorneys charged that excessive 
publicity created an intolerable atmosphere which could 
not have given Franks a fair trial. They are hoping to 
do better in Porter County. 

Bloom: others benefiting from Ind. taxes 

Congressional challenger Republican Allan Bloom called 
the attention of Roush's stand on welfare economy in a 
news conference Tuesday. Bloom said that under pro- 
grams supported by Roush, for every dollar returned 
from the Federal Government in aid programs, $1.61 
was paid from Indiana citizens. Bloom showed that other 
states were benefiting excessively from Indiana money. 
Gubenatorlal hopeful Matt Welsh was touring the state 
as Dr. Bowen, his opponent, was at Concordia Senior 
College and Indiana-Purdue University Fort Wayne. From 
all indications the Governor's race will be one of the 
closest ever.

The genius of our highway engineers was Illustrated 
again last week with the repaving of South Clinton St. 
Not more than a few short days after the blacktop had

' A preliminary long lange 
plan which is to be leased 
September 29th bv the 
Indiana Commission for 
Higher Education today was 
described as a major ef- 
fort to stimulate public 
discussion of Indiana's 
total system of postsecond- 
ary education. 

Th^ description was 
offered by O.C. Car- 
michael of South Bend, 
Commission Chairman. He 
said the document will be 
designed to provide the 
framework for along range 
plan for higher education in 
Indiana. Whenthedocument 
is released, it will be in 
the form of a preliminary 
draft for public discussion. 
The Commission is sche- 
duled to release the draft 
to the public at a meeting 
In the administration build- 
ing of Indiana Vocational 
Technical College, 5221 
Ivy Tech Drive, Indiana- 
polis, at 11:00 A.M. Sep- 
tember 29th. The draft Is 
a result of hundreds of hours 
of work by Commission 
members, professional 
staff and experienced con- 
sultants. 

James B, Kessler, Com- 
missioner for Higher Edu- 
cation, said the document 
to be made public Septem- 
ber 29th will be in two 
volumes. 

Volume One, titled "The 
Current Status,' consti- 
tutes the first comprehen- 
sive compllaton of data on

ventory of available post 
high school programs, the 
present governance and 
structure of institutions, 
students access to institu- 
tions and programs, and 
research and public ser- 
vice programs. The volume 
deals with both public and 
nonpublic institutions. 
Kessler said Volume Two, 
entitled "A Pattern for the 
Future", Is based, in large 
part, on the material con- 
tained in Volume One. 

After the Commission has 
heard this public reaction, 
Kessler said, a final edition 
will be prepared for sub- 
mission to the public, the 
General Assembly and the 
Governor early in 1973. 

Kessler noted that thede-~ 
velopment of the prelimin- 
ary draft for public dis- 
cussion was accomplished 
In a relative brief period 
of time. "In approximately 
one year the Commission 
has developed a prelimin- 
ary draft of a document 
that provides a solid start- 
ing point for informal pub- 
lic discussion. Comparable 
Commissions in other 
States required several 
years to reach the same 
stage of long reange plan 
development. The achieve- 
ment of the Indiana Com- 
mission members and the 
mission results from the 
dedication and energy of 
Commission members and 
the outstanding contribu- 
tion of all of the Institu- 
tions of higher education," 
Kessler concluded. 



Erdtmann 

selected 

co-chairman 

Dr. Bernd D. Erdtmann, 
associate professor of geo- 
logy at Indiana University 
at Fort Wayne, was ap-

special symposium on 
"Usefulness and Utili- 
zation of Graptolites in Ge- 
ology" at the 24th Inter- 
national Geological Con- 
gress at Montreal, Canada. 

The Congress, which at- 
tracted 8.000 geologists 
from 135 countries, meets 
once every four years and 
Is considered a most pres- 
tigious and decisive organ- 
ization. 

During the Congress. 
Dr. Erdtmann was Invited 
to present a paper on"Or-

Fixed parking ticfcets- 
but not for students 

For those of ub who have been on campus for a number 
of years, the paid parking controversy Is still a cause 
of deep hurt. At no other time in the history of I-PU 
hab there been such a blatant contempt for student 
opinion. 

Previous to paid parking, there were special student 
lots and special faculty lots. With the advent of paid 
parking, or so we were told, all university parkers would 
be treated equally w'rhin each sticker designation. 

In other words there would be no special reserve] 
parking for faculty or deans. "A" faculty md "A" 
students would compete for the same "A" spaces. 

This did quiet the students somewhat; they did manage 
to remove the front row parking for the privileged few. 
But to this day the new "equality" promise remains 
unfulfilled. 

To be sure, there are no reserved spaces for faculty 
or staff. Yet this equality was to extend to the parking 
court and the paying of tickets. It was not. 

Students who have unpaid traffic tickets are not allowed 
to register for the next semester. In essence, they are 
expelled from the University. Staff members, clerical 
and service, are threatened with firing If they do not 
pay. But what of the privileged few in the faculty? 
Eight faculty members have parking debts running back 
to the 1971-72 year or before. No recrimination Is even 
being considered the eight. An untold number of faculty 
tickets have been paid by the deans when the violator 
refused to pay. 

To those students who have been denied registration 
we ask, when was the last time a dean offered to pay 
your ticket? 

This equality nonsense is just one more lie told to the 
students in the great paid parking fraud. The administration 
obviously does not consider credibility as important as 
preservation of aristocratic privileges. 

Exclusive lounges, "fixed" parking tickets — what comes 
next, Deans?

Tennis courts needed 

To the Editor 

As a small female-type 
student, the football fiel,(J 
ha s hardly been used by me. 
However, I would be happy 
to donate my $15 for a half 
of a tennis net or 3 square 
feet oftennlscourt. It would 
be nice for all the students, 
to have 8 tennis courts out 
on campus so all-Including 
the women-could have at 
least their use of the acti- 
vity fees. This isfar better 
than a large pool for mock 
■ naval battles or Imponlng 
hungry Uons.

Man lives by his ethics. He 
likes to feel he is a moral 
creature. But man creates 
his ethics, and then lives by 
them while It suits him to do 
so. When man's absolutes 
run into barriers, man sim- 
ply alters his absolutes and 
continues merrily on his 
way. For example, Lester 
R. Brown author of Seeds of 
Change Is concerned about 
the population "explosion. " 
Realizing the strong re- 
action against all forms of 
birth rate regression poli- 
cies on the basis of ethics. 
Brown has come up with a 
nice new phrase: He calls 
it "developing a survival 
ethic." 

If he Is successful in hav- 
ing this concept accepted, 
we will then have a whole 
new set of outlooks toward 
birth prevention. In this ap- 
proach I find the most mer- 
it of all the arguments I 
have thus far heard on this 
subject. Rather than conti- 
nue the arguments be i ng 
launched from different 
premises. Brown presents 
a brand new common pre- 
mise from which everyone 
can argue. 

Accepting such an ethlcls 
a solution well withlnthea- 
bllltles of our culture for we 
have done so continuously 
since the beginning of our 
culture. For example, in 
Jeff Gibson's words, "Re- 
volution is a dirty word un- 
til you put American' In 
front of it." Anotheradopt- 
ed ethic which allowed the 
conquest of half of Mexico 
was the concept of "Mani- 
fest Destiny." 

So, If we then perform our 
age-old semantical trick, 
we can (according to many 
Ecologlsts) save ourselves. 
If we adopt a "Survival 
Ethic," we wiUthenbeable 
to justify many actions 
which our "morality" cur- 
rently forbids. 

It is also comforting to see 
the White society beginning 
to look ar itself for the 
cause of the problem. The 
middle class American 
currently consumes fifty 



(50) times that of the Ind- 
ian. Thus, if we limit the 
birth rate of the middle 
class white we do more to 
problem than if we concen- 
trate of the poor or the non- 
white. Perhaps we could 
provide a bl-polar Incentive 



by Marty Martinez 



system for the population. 
We could reward a poor 
married woman for every 
year that she went without 
having a child. We could 
also fine every middle 
class mother for every 
child she bore.

Marriage and alienation 



One of the many questions 
to come out of the 'aexual 
revolution' concerns the 
deslreability of retaining 
some form of sexual exclu- 
sivity In the marriage con- 
tract. Those who favor its 
retention usually do so on 
the grounds that sexual ex- 
clusivity Is at least one of 
the defining characteristics 
of marriage as v/e know It 
In the West, The argument 
often continues that if you 
want to eliminate It, then 
call the subsequent rela- 
tionship something other 
than marriage, an argument 
often tinged with the fear 
that what we are talking 
about Is yet another step in 
the moral 'heat death' of our 
society. Those opposed to 
its retention claim that the 
above 'definition' ofmar- 
. rlage do so on the grounds 
tliat It is not a true 'human- 
itarian' definition, but ra- 
ther a bourgois definition of 
marriage. It is, the argu- 
ment runs, a result of age 
upon age of religious and 
social control which may 
have been necessary In feu- 
dal and industrial societies; 
but we arenow entering " 
upon the post-industrial age 
in which the cry l3 freedom, 
and polymorphous perver- 
sity, rather than being so- 
ciety's moral 'heat death' 
is Its only consistently hu- 
man end. 

Neutral position 

More often than either of 
the aforementioned po«- 
sltions one tends to hear the 
more neutral position that 
whatever the two marriage 
principles decide vis-a-vls 
this question I s right for 
them and as far as this re- 
sponse goes I agree with It, 
I have little Inclination to 
meddle in the personal 
affairs of others much less 
judge them, yet in our so- 
ciety at this point in time 
one must be careful lest in 
the name of humanity one 
becomes exploitative of 
others. I think that it is a 
valid analysis of t h I s so- 
ciety to say that the heavy 
emphasis on security and 
maincanance of the status 
quo to the detriment of no- 
vel solutions has the effect 
of sacrificing the future to 
the present. Still toabsolu- 
tize future possibilities. In 
the name of freedom, to the 
detriment of real people in 
the present, you and I, has 
the effect of sacrificing the 
present to the future which 
isnosolutlon, but rather the 
creation of a not her prob- 
lem, (t is the peculiar Irony 
of history that If one either 
sacrifices the future to the 
present or the present to the 
future one is left with nei- 
ther, but is rather con- 
demned to repeat the past. 



In m o r e concrete terms 
the problem is one of per- 
sonal well being. In order 
for anyone to rescind sexual 
exclusivity In marriage one 
must be very sure of one's 
personal self-concept and 
one's place In society, 
which, given our present 
society, is difficult to the 
point of impossibility. Our 
society has and does define 
'true love' In terms of sex- 
ual exclusivity and any cou- 
ple or group of couples who 
decide to forgo It must be 
s u re that they mean what 
t h ey say or the group can 
become self-destructive. If 
for example one member of 
t h e group merely g o e s a- 
long and finds out later that 
he or she tend B to Invest 
every sex act with the whole 
worth of his/her being then 
that person and that group Is 
In trouble. While it may be 
true to say that that person 
Is m a k i n g a mistake, still 
the mistake Is commonand 
the group by not recogni- 
zing same Is treating that 
person as object and not as 



Is that such a policy whose 
express purpose is to effect 
the return of true positive, 
though restricted, meaning 
to the s e X a c t a n d subse- 
quently to marriage has ra- 
ther the effect of making all 
such meaning purely neg- 
ative. It has been pointed 
out recently that sexual 
availability accrues to a 
man In our society for a 
much longer duration than 
to a women. A man can be 
a suitable sexpartner 
through middle age but the 
societal aesthetic that we 
have created punishes all 
women who don't fit the 
image of Mr, Hefner's re- 
touched teen-agers. Given 
our present social situation 
this new sexual freedom 
could easily mean the fur- 
ther sexual exploitation of 
women by august but very 
dirty old men. It would not 
be the first time In history 
that real people have, lit- 
erally andflguratlvely, 
been screwed In the name of 
high sounding principles. 

The point of allthlsisthat 
we are real people In a so- 
cially rea 1 world and as 
such we must concern our- 
selves with real future 
possibilities, not the future 
of idle speculation of our 
sexual fantasies ala Hem- 
ingway. Mailer, and 
Schlitz beer commercials, 
A real possibility is one for 
which there Isa present 
problem which needsltasa 
solution, and social condi- 
tions thatadmit of the poss- 
ibility being realized. Any 
of our current social prob- 
lems and some of the solu- 
tions qualify, but In the case 
of sexual exclusivity, in 



Sex and the morality myth 



by Mike Ellis, Forum Editor 



F o r m o s t people, sexual 
Interaction outside of mar- 
riage Is an Issue, For peo- 
ple who are married, this 
issue becomes much more 
intense, much more conse- 
quential. It i s conceivable 
that there exists a cultural 
setting In which sexual act- 
ivity outside marriage is 
wholly acceptable. Thus, It 
becomes apparent that that 
which gives sexual "dislo- 
yalty" In marriage Its in- 
tensity is not the act itself, 
but rather the social norms 
regarding the act which we 
accept and live by. 

Social norms 

Social norms, by their ex- 
istence, quietly transmit to 
each of us assumptions 
about our essential hu- 
manity. The question whe- 
ther the assumptions are 
correct Is, indeed. Import- 
ant, but only secondary in 
nature. The more radical 
question Is whether social 
values and dictates actually 
exist over and above the In- 
dividual's own world. Even 
if there Is some transcend- 
ent, all-affecting social 
code book of morality. In 
what sense must it affect 
me? The only way some- 
thing can affect m.elsbyits 
confronting me; by con- 
fronting me, It Is making it- 
self able to be known; by be- 
ing able to be known, the 
collection of social norms 
makes it self something 
able to he chosen. In short, 
whether &gt;ve actually do it, 
we can choose our own set 
of values, our own set of 
norms. (In fact, I would ar- 
gue that we can't escape 
choosing, forchoosingto 
allow the society at large 
determine our values Is 
choosing that value system. 
What this Implies, however, 
is that we also choose all 
the assumptions that are. 
packed Into the social dic- 
tates. This suggests that we 
believe or want to belelve 
that the society knows us 
Individually better than we 
know ourselves.) Choosing 
to allow The Society to de- 
termine our values is. In 
some sense, allowing it to 
determine our essential hu- 
man-ness, our existance. 

Allowing ourselves to be 
dominated by social values 
is a lack of Integrltyl It 

marriage, I doubt If it qual- 
ifies as a present problem. 
If sexual exclusivity In 
marriage Is a problem. It 
will be so determinable only 
after the more general 
types of alienation (l.e, man 
to women, persons to so- 
ciety) have been worked 
out. Polymorphous perver- 
sity could be the last step 
in the freedom of man or the 
last step in his objective a- 
llenation, and our inability 
at the present tlmetodecide 
which, seemstoindlcate 
that it is not a real future 
possibility. 



would seem that the only 
real purpose of social 
norms is to provide mater- 
ial around which we can 
form guilt complexes. 
Norms do function as a way 
we can find other men and 
women with whom we can 
cooperate; It Is time, how- 
ever, that we take chat re- 
sponslblUty upon our- 
selves. In being responsible 
to ourselves, we must be, 
and are, responsible to 
others. Where is there 
room foranabstract, myth- 
ical all-affecting collection 
of norms? 

How, then, do we decide 
about the "morality" of Is- 
sues such as sexual inter- 
action before marriage, or 
sexual Interaction with 
someone o t h e r t h a n mar- 
riage partner? What does It 
mean for us to be sexual be- 
ings? It Is not the case that 
there exists outside of us 
some Meaning for sexual- 
ity, and that we then come 
to It as sexual beings. We 
exist as sexual beings, 
first, and then we give 
meaning to our sexuality. 
The act of intercourse in 
Itself has no Inherent 
meaning, it is merely a fact 
of our existence. Having a 
bowel movement has no 
meaning in Itself; It Is 
merely another biological 
function, {Some people do 
give meaning to feces, how- 
ever, and they are imme- 
d 1 a c e 1 y psychoanalysed, 
Fromm will tell of necro- 
phlllal tendencies and sym- 
biotic fixations to mother; 
Freud will speak of obvious 
anal fixations,) Where, 
then, does the meaning 
come from? From us. We 
give our activities any 
meaning that they might 
have for us. 

Sexuality controls 

Our sexuality can control 
us or it can be an instru- 
ment that we use. Sexuality 
controls us when It becomes 
our Identity. For example, 
many women have been 
taught that their sole Ident- 
ity Is their sexual functions. 
Beyond their vagina, they 
are nothing. If a women Is 
so pressured to adopt this 
concept that she Is left with 
no strength to rebel against 
It (?),thenher sexuality be- 
comes her. She has no 
Identity, no concept of self- 
hood outside of her sexual 
functioning. Her thoughts 
cannot express her exist- 
ence, her dreams cannot 



express her existence, her 
works are of no worth. Her 
total existence is expressed 
when she functions sex- 
ually. 

We choose 

Sexuality can bean instru- 
ment In that we can use It for 
personal physiological sat- 
isfaction, we can use it to 
secure another's Interest in 
us, or we can use it indiff- 
erent modes of love. What- 
ever meaning sexual inter- 
action is going to have, we 
choose it directly or we 
choose It by allowing social 
dictatestotell us how to 
view It, We cannot escape 
choosing. 

Hence, Che answer to the 
question of morality of sex- 
ual Interaction outside of 
marriage lies within ys. It 
Is possible for us as hu- 
man beings toloveandhave 
sexual activities outside of 
the marriage contract. As 
children of our society. It 
may not be possible without 
being laden with guilt feel- 
ings and frustration. If we

Elton John's new 
"Honky Chateau" 
worth listening to 

by Michael Snyder 



Don't let the name "Hon- 
ky Chatedu" bother you. 
Actually, Elton John'snew- 
est album has no racial 
overtones ... he's not even 
American, But "Honkey 
Chateau" Is full of some 
of the best material he and 
Bernie Taupln have ever 
turned out. 

Recorded In France, 
"Honky Chateau" is char- 
acterized by such diverse 
tracks as John'shits "Hon- 
ky Cat" and "Rocket 
Man" which, while typical, 
are not the best cuts on 
the album. Of course, El- 
ton John was due for a- 
nother good album after his 
last few catastrophes, but 
this has to be his best al- 
bum. He has a habit of 
Interspersing good tracks 
with bad tracks, making it 
very difficult to listen to 
an entire side, but he has 
nearly solved that problem 
on "Honky Chateau." The 
whole album Is worth lis- 
tening to and cuts like 
"Amy" make the entire 



experience very worth- 
while. 

As usual, John Is backed 
by fantastic sidemenandon 
this album we also get to 
hear guest artist Jean-Luc 
Ponty on electric violin, 
a dubious treat since Ponty 
doesn't appear to be the 
Al Kooper of the violin. 
Fortunately, none of the 
tracks are seriously mar- 
red by Ponty's presence, 
but he doesn't appear to 
be of the same caliber as 
Davey (guitar). Dee (bass), 
and Nigel (drums), the o- 
ther three-fourths of El- 
ton John's regular tour- 
ing company. 

Standing out on this al- 
bum Is Nigel's consistent- 
ly tight drumming and some 
rdce banjo work by Davey 
on one track. The only 
criticism that could be 
made of this album Is that 
it Is tight, perhaps too 
tight and this structuring 
may Inhibit the wild, loose 
style EltonJohn displays on 
stage. But that's a minor 
fault. 



No one can taite 
James Bond seriously 



fay Liz Schevtchnk 






Anyone who has never 
been to a James Bond movie 
has missed a truely unique 
experience-almost. After 
all, what better example 
of the folk-hero of the mid 
sixties reflecting all of its 
emphasis on glamour and 
sophisticated life styles Is 
there than the impeccable, 
suave, British agent 007? 

In his time. Bond became 
an institution. Cold War 
tensions still waxed high, 
and during the days of In- 
creased paranoia over 
being 'done in" by those 
dastardly villains, our 
enemies, whoever they may 
have been, it was comfort- 
ing to know that such 
staunch defenders of the 
world as James Bond stood 
ready to thwart the plans 
of the master crinimala. 
Exemplifying all of the 
modern guardian angels 
ever-eager to face danger 
and defend whatever may 
have needed defending. 
Bond was probably a sym- 
bolic object of trust to some 
people. 

Of course, NO ONE could 
EVER take James Bond 
seriously. A Bond flick 
Is pure fantasy. Bond him- 
self Is In many respects 
too much. Too much o f 
everything. He glides from 
one risky escapade to 
another without the slight- 
est hesitation. The world 



Students invited 
to faculty 
music program 

The faculty of the Division 
of Music, Indiana- Purdue 
University at Fort Wayne, 
win present a potpourri of 
musical selections from 
11:30 a.m. to 12:20 p.m. 
October 4 In the recital hall 
of the new Building A on 
campus. 

The program Isopentothe 
public but Is especially for 
all University students, who 
are Invited to drop in and to 
leave at t h e I r convenience 
during the Informalcon- 
cert. 

Faculty members who will 
appear on the program will 
Include Dr. Andrew Harper, 
baritone; Susannah Onwood, 
cello; Warren Jaworskl, 
baritone; David Jones, vio- 
lin; Roberta Jaworskl, 
mezzo soprano; Masson 
Robertson, piano, and the 
Faculty Trio, comprised of 
mrs. Onwood, Jones and 
Robertson. 



is his and he knows it. 
Opponents fall like flies be- 
fore his onslaught. Beauti- 
ful girU find him ir- 
restlble, so overwhelmed 
are they by the magnitude 
of his charm. Some may 
refuse him initially, butall 
melt Into his arms In the 
end. Blessed with a superb 
intelligence, good looks, 
British practicality, his 
own strength, and an im- 
pressive array of gadgets 
courteously supplied by 
Her Majesty's Govern- 
ment, Bond is Invincible. 
He realizes that he has 
a job to perform and he 
does it with pleasure. Even 
after he is dead, he keeps 
re-surfacing In the world 
(in more ways than one) 
to continue in the line of 
duty. Could such a man do 
anything but help to In- 
spire confidence? 

Bond Is great. Great be- 
cause his movies are such 
fun. Aimed at providing 
nothing more than sheer 
entertainment, they serve 
their purpose with gusto, 
If the obviou s Im- 
plausibllities of some of 
Bond's hairbreadth es- 
capes are overlooked. 
(Help Is always justaround 
the corner, usually as of- 
fered by some lovely girl.) 
films like YOU ONLY 
LIVE TWICE and 

THUNDERBALL can only 
serve one purpose - that 
of relaxation. 

If viewed with this in mind, 
and with the attitude that a 
Bond film, serving as the 
great American fairy-tale, 
can perhaps be a part of 
contemporary culture, the 
time spent In the theatre can 
be worth It all.
