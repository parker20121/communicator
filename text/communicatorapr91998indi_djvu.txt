Corrections 



)n March 26, The 
Communicator's story on Career 
Services contained errors. 

According to Vickie Bandor 
Braun, assistant director for 
Placement Services, Career 
Services is an intermediary, they 
do not actually place students in 
jobs. 

Career Services did not match 
10,000 students with jobs in 
1997, as was quoted. Ten thou- 
sand resume referrals to employ- 
ers were made. 

The Enpen Plus disk costs S25 
to anyone who purchases it. 
Graduate students do not pay a 
different fee, as was reported. 

Alumni who use Placement 
Services may pay an additional 
fee. which is pro-rated There is 
no registration fee for currently 
enrolled students. 

Career Services also does not 
mail copies of Ihe Career 
Opportunity Bulletins to students' 
homes. The office does mail 



small portions of the listed jobs to 
students registered with 
Placement Services.The office 
does, however, carry the binders. 

There were also some errors in 
the March 19 story on Women's 
History Month. According lo 
Linda Fox, director of Women's 
Studies, IPFW was the first cam- 
pus of any Indiana or Purdue uni- 
versity campus to have a degree 
program in women's studies. 

IPFW has had a degree pro- 
gram in Women's Studies since 
1992. 

IIJ-Bloomington was the sec- 
ond campus. Its gender studies 
degree program began in 1997. 
lU-South Bend bas just received 
approval for a degree program. 

Purdue University has a 
women's studies program, but 
does not have a degree program.

campuses had such a program.

As graduation approaches, 
seniors often wonder what is out 
there in the real world 

Are ihere burgers and fries in 
your future or will your degree

Chris Douse, a 1997 graduate, 
has fused his love for children and 
his communications degree into a 
career at Lutheran Child Care 
Center. 

"I have always liked kids and I 
love working with them. I like 
being a positive role model which 
they can look to," Douse said. 

He has been with the center since 
graduation as assistant director. 

As assistant director, he mosdy 
does administrative work, paper 
work and manage the overall oper- 
adons. 

"But I also gei to

Douse said.

Jones case o 
decision will 



Well, il's over. Thank God 
almighty il's over. Paula Jones has 
been seni back home without her 
apology and without any cash. Her 
case was dismissed because the 
court decided there wasn't proof that 
Paula Jones actually suffered dam- 
ages in the workplace. She wasn't, 
fired, demoted or otherwise penal- 
ized for saying "No" lo the 
Governor. 

Although wc are ecstatic about 
this soap opera finally reaching its 
last episode, wc do have a problem 
with the reasoning behind the dis- 
missal of Ibe Jones case. 

Let's put (his in a scenario that 
fits into our world. Let's imagine, 
hypothetical I y of course, thai one of 
our dear professors dropped his 
drawers in the presence of one of his 
female students. He then asks her to 
"Tame Die Shrew" and she flat out 
declines his offer. After this occur- 
rence, the student doesn't experi- 
ence any repercussions for turning 
him down. She does well on exams, 
papers and passes the class. 

Now, the question is since there 
wasn't any retaliation on the profes- 
sor's part does this mean there was- 
n't any harassment? Wc have to say 



uer; 
inger 



"NO." The harassment occurred 
regardless of whether or not the pro- 
fessor retaliates and (he student suf- 
fers. But, according to the court in 
the case of Ms. Jones, the student 
wouldn't have a "leg" to stand on. 
since she passed the course. This 
process of thinking scares us, and it 
should scare many others as well. 

We believe that this decision of 
the court will further the difficulty of 
reporting harassment because the 
court has put into play the idea that 
the harassed hasn't suffered if retali- 
ation hasn't occurred. How prepos- 
terous! If there isn't any form of 
repercussion against the barasser 
(hen bow can the harassed seek jus- 
lice? 

We'd bet our meager monies 
that the female student would suffer 
even though she passed her class. 
Mosi likely, everyday she had to 
attend thai class. 

We hope that the decision the 
court handed down was due to the 
fact that they wanted to hurry and 
bush this whole Presidential episode 
under the rug, and not because Ihey 
want to set any kind of precedent for 
further cases of harassment.

Don't complain, take action 



To the Editor: 

Before I respond (o Mr. Kerry 
Adkins' letter in the April 2 edition, 
I'd like lo congratulate Shawn Heit, 
Charles Newman and my opposition. 
, Ryan Smith for winning this election. 
ITiopc thai Heit, Newman and Smith 
will raise awareness to this campus 
and bring more quality programming 
(o this campus. 

Also my lhanks to thcWAJI 95.1 
FM Morning Crew for giving me a 
chance lo tell students about students' 
government here ai IPFW and for 
updating them during my campaign. 
Plus, thanks to them for giving other 
candidates a chance lo have free air 
time on the show! 

Now, on 10 Mr. Adkins letter. He 
said, "He was very pleased to see thai 
Heit and Newman will be leading our 
student body." And he also staled, 
"The past five years has given us 
Greek leaders who do nothing but 
increase Iheir own prestige while dis- 
regarding student needs." Well. Mr. 
Adkins, there will be a sixth, (unless 
Heit and Newman do whai ihey say 
Lhey will do) 

You and 10,000 other students 
bad a chance not lo vole the Greek 
ticket into office. Mr. Adkins, Shawn 
Heit is a Greek! Chuck Newman ran 
on the Greek ticket If you did not 
want a sixth year of this, then you 



should have voted for the other can- 
didates, including myself. 

See. Mr, Adkins, if you wanted to 
change students' government as you 
know it ihen you should have joined. 
No ifs, ands, or huts about ill 

And men "he" goes off on Mr. 
Kevin Orlhman and Mr. Mark 
Sprunger, saying thai they "did not do 
a damn thing." It's not those iwo you 
should blame, Mr, Adkins. You 
should blame the members of IPSGA 
who did not show up at ajoinl meet- 
ing to discuss matters. And you 
should have joined the organization, 
too, if you were that concerned 

To all of ihe students who voted, 
"Thanks", even if you did not vote for 
me. To all of those who did not, you 
still have a voice. Make your concern 
fell to Heit and Newman! If you do 
not like whai is going on, JOIN! 

Your voice can and will be beard! 

To Mr. Adkins: You had your 
chance! Please do not attack this 
organizauon like you did in this letter. 
With your actions, Mr. Adkins, there 
may be no student government orga- 
nization on this campus and then 
what?! The students here are not 
ready for that!

To the Editor: 

I was truly appalled at (he 
written and cartoon editorials 
concerning Donna Railiff in this 
.week's paper! And I cannot, 
leave your hateful message 
unchallenged. 

I happen to know a great 
deal about Donna and her life 
experience and the only correct 
statement in your editorial is 
thai Donna was convicted as an 
adult for the arson fire that 
killed her mother and sister. 

First of all, I gather from 
your editorial thai the "Juvenile 
Facility" you are thinking of is 
Girls' School or Wood Youth 
Center... places thai are designed 
to deal with minors who have 
engaged in anti-social behavior. 
Wbile those are not summer 
camps to be sure, they are a lot 
safer than adull prisons. But 
more to the point. Donna is not 
in thai kind of facility. She is in 
a Residential Treatment Center 
for children and adolescents 
who have been severely abused 
and neglected and who are 
experiencing emotional prob- 
lems as a result. These arc 
indeed "safe havens" for the

Cursing doesn't get 
point across 



To the Editor, 

While reading the April 2, 
1998, iss'be' ~'6? ' The 
Communicator I was amazed to 
see ignorance running rampant 
in Nol Beckley's editorial 
"Reverse Racism is Still 
Racism." White making an 
interesting point about how 
using racist slurs doesn't have 
ihe same repercussions for 
minorities as it would for 
Caucasians, he brought his idea 
down low by resorting to cursing 
where ii wasn't even needed. 
The only point that was apparent 
to me was that he was an igno- 
rant person speaking on igno- 
rance; much like the blind lead- 
ing (he blind. When I saw words 
such as "sorry-ass," "bullshit," 
and "Tarheel ass" I wasn't 
offended, but 1 wondered how 
the point would come across to 
those who do take offense to this 
kind of language. It seems lo me 
that Mr. Beckley is putting him- 
self in the same son of spot that 
Reggie White did. 

In Nol Beckley's mind, 
Reggie White was able to speak 
slurs and hiding behind bis sta- 
tus as a minority, incur limited 
amounts of anger. Much the 



Congrats to newly 
elected IPSGA 



To the Editor 

Well, the semester is quickly 
coming to a close, as is my lemt 
in office as your Student Body 
Vice President. First and fore- 
mast, I'd like lo thank those who 
voted for and supported me 
while in office; it was your sup- 
port that made everything possi- 
ble. 

I would also idee to thank 
Kevin Orthman, Student Body 
President, for giving me the 
opportunity lo run for office 
with him last year. Mr. Orthman 
has a great administration and is 
one of the most influential peo- 
ple I've met while here at IPFW. 
I wish him much success in bis 
future endeavors. 

Our Student Senate also 
deserves recognition; they've 
done one hell of a job this 
semester, being one of the 
largest, most efficient and 
United Senates in many years! 

Many people have 
expressed disappointment in my 
decision not to seek re-election 



and for that I am Iruly sorry 
After much thoughi I decided 
that it would not be practical for 
me to serve another term. 

Finally, whenever one 
serves in an elected public posi- 
tion it is inevitable (hat there 
will be those good ol* pessimists 
and cynics criticizing everything 
thai the elected person does (or 
doesn't do) just for the sake of it. 
Thai's perfecdy fine because it's 
all pan of the politics and the 
job. 

In parting, I'd like lo wish 
our newly elected representa- 
tives good luck in office; they'll 
do a fine job. Remember life is 
10 percent what happens to us 
and 90 percent how we react to 
it. With a positive attitude there 
is no limit on what we can 
achieve in life. 

Mark Sprunger 

IPFW Student Body Vice 

President 



same with Nol Beckley and his 
comments — he's cursing out of 
anger, yet he's hiding behind his 
"righteous" anger to keep from 
being hounded by those who 
don't enjoy his flamboyant use { 
of harsh language. 

I would understand if you 
were talking lo some friends, 
cursing while expressing your 
anger about his topic, Mr. 
Beckley, bul this is a newspaper. 
In fact, you are the Editor of this 
newspaper. That would mean 
that you had lime to put down 
your thoughts instead of running 
off at the mouth to your friends 
In addition to that, you have nol 
upheld ihe integrity of The 
Communicator whatsoever. 
You've made il a place where 
thinking is not required and 
cursing is the norm. Is this what 
you want your paper to become? 

In parting. I would like to 
say that the next time you want 
to say something and say it right, 
think what your words will con- 
vey, as I see you just as ignorant 
as Reggie While.

Ratliff' s supporters grow 



To the Editor - 

Your issue of April 2 includ- 
ed a canoon and editorial on 
Donna Ratliff, the juvenile sen- 
tenced as an adult for murdering 
her mother and sister. I agree thai 
hers was a heinous crime; and I 
agree that the juvenile justice 
system in Indiana is ill-equipped 
(o manage juveniles who commit 
such serious crimes. I cannot 
agree with the stance you take 
against both. Donna and juvenile 
facilities. 

If I understand the core of 
your argument. "She fRadiff) 
acted as an adult, therefore she 
should be punished as an adult, 
period." This is a teenager who is 
too young to drive, to drink, to 
vote, to manage her own 
finances. The law protects her 
from herself by ensuring thai she 
is not allowed rights and privi- 
leges she is too immature to man- 
age I would ask: can a juvenile 
commit a crime so heinous that 
the law no longer affords her pro- 
tection? 

You comment on the danger- 
ous state of juvenile facilities in 
Indiana. I worked in residential 
treatment facilities for youth for 
ten years and continue to provide 
consultation and assessment for 
such facdities. In (urn, 1 complete 
assessments for several courts in 
the area, visit many of the county 
jails and work with numerous 
former (and soon-to-be) inmates 
from Indiana prisons. In my 
opinion, Donna is better served 
in a juvenile facility, despite its 
imperfections. 

For those in prisons, the 
nationwide recidivism rate is 
approximately 80 percent. Since 
the recidivism rate is so high, 
should we stop sending people to 



prisons? Residents in juvenile 
facilities have usually been taken 
from their homes due to abuse or 
neglect; failed to adjust to roster 
care; and often literally have 
nowhere else to go Because 
juvenile facdities are imperfect, 
comprised of angry and emotion- 
ally wounded children and ado- 
lescents, should we stop sending 
juveniles to them? 

But you make the case — 
quite con-ecdy, I believe — that 
Donna is an exception. Her situa- 
tion is different, her crime more 
compelling. And she will be pun- 
ished. She remains m a secure 
facility. She was tried as an adult- 
Her record is not expunged at 18 
years of age. She does not "go 
free" at age 18 Instead, she 
returns to a women's prison to 
complete her sentence. In my 
opinion — having worked in resi- 
dential treatment and having seen 
the psychological scarring creat- 
ed by adult incarceration — it 
would serve only to harden 
Donna even more, at an early 
age, to send her to an adult prison 
now. 

Your editorial also misses the 
larger issue. Regardless of 
Donna's crime, she has become a 
"test case" in Indiana. What 
should be done with Donna 
Radiff is in one sense superflu- 
ous. Her sentence has called 
attention to both the ambiguities 
of the taw as written and the atti- 
tudes of the people of the stale on 
juvende crime. 

I would genuinely like to see 
The Communicator pursue these 
topics, but from a more balanced 
and reasoning perspective.

Poor Donna Radiff. Everyone licking on their thumb to wipe the

Remember her, the

to get revenge on her

I have no prob-

want. 

I don't 
think anything 
this innocuous 
happened to 
Donna. I get the 
feeling she was 
abused by her 
mother, but that 
still does not 
excuse the cold- 
blooded murder 
of ber sister. So 
many people 
are talking 
about how 
lough this is for 
or D( 



things that often embarrass us, like because now she has to spend 



much of her life behind bars. 

Excuse me for being heartless. 
but where is the outpouring of love 
for the little charcoal briquette that 
used to be Donna's sister? 

Why is there no one lamenting 
the fact that even though Donna 
will spend much of her life behind 
bars, at least she has a life lo spend. 

Her sister will never gel thai 
chance. 

She will never have die chance 
to grow up and hate her mother like 
Donna did. Couldn't Donna rebel 
in other ways besides torching her 
mother and sister? 

When I rebelled, 1 smoked, 
drank gin, disobeyed house rules, 
listened to Iron Maiden and 
became and all-around S.O.B. 

Donna's sister will never be a 
teenager. Donna's sister will never 
be able to rebel against her mother. 
Donna's sister wdl never be able lo 



break her curfew, have sex in the 
back of a Chrysler LeBaron or dye 
her hair purple. 

Donna now lives in a place 
called Crossroads. Not necessarily 
the nicest place lo be, but compared 
to a pine box, it's a country club. 
The kids there have shown and- 
social behavior. 

And if broiling your mother 
and sister aren't the most extreme 
examples of ami-social behavior, 
(hen smack me around and call me 
Susan. 

What yanks my chain harder, 
arc people who are trying lo help 
Donna and her state of mind (like 
The Journal Gazelle and some of 
the contributors to our tellers sec- 
tion).

much emotional response if this 
was not a litdc white girl who

'Into the Woods' 

Promises Excellence 



A Trip to the Liquor Store 



By Aoam Taylor 
Staff Writer 

Grimm, The mere hini of Ihe 
word conjures pictures of depres- 
sion and darkness, leaving one feel- 
ing empty and alone. 

That's not the case when the 
Grimm brothers are put on stage 
though, as the IPFW Department of 
Theatre will prove with its final per- 
formance of its 1997-98 season. 

Sponsored by the News- 
Sentinel, "Into the Woods" is a 
Stephen Sond he im/ James Lapinc 
adaptation of such famous Grimm 
Brothers' fairy tales as Cinderella. 
Utile Red Riding Hood, Jack and 
the Beanstalk, Rapunzcl and other 
characters we all hear about at bed- 
time as children. 

The production features a musi- 
cal plot as characters travel into the 
woods on a quest for their individual 
" hap pi ly -ever- afters " 

Sondhcim and Lapine provide 
an efficient means for tying the sto- 
ries together, as well. 

The stories all revolve around a 
banker and his wife who are seeking 
to undo a witch's curse in order to 
have a child. 

By the end of Act One. each of 
the stories have ended true to their 
promise of happily ever after. 

Act Two, however, provides a 
different glimpse and leaves the 
audience questioning what it is 
about happily ever after that's really 
happy as each character is brought 
to bear with the consequences of 
their wishes. 

When the first production of the 
musical came out in 1987, it 
received ten Tony nominations and 
picked up Best Score, Best Book 
and Leading Actress in a Musical. 

'into the Woods" was also 
named Best Musical of 1988 by 
both the New York Drama Critics' 



Circle and the Drama Desk. 

Critics spoke highly of it as well 
in various prominent musical 
reviews across the nation. 

"Sondheim has written a spell- 
binding score, witty enough to make 
old stories fresh for the adults, love- 
ly enough to enchant youngsters..." 
said Howard Kissel in the Daily 
News. 

William A. Henry in Time mag- 
azine also loved it, saying ""Into the 
Woods" is the best show yet from 
the most creative mind in musical 
theatre today." 

The IPFW Department of 
Theatre intends to duplicate the pre- 
vious success of the show by assem- 
bling 20 of the area's most talented 
actors and actresses, a 15-member 
orchestra, and a full support staff of 
backstage technicians to bring "Into 
the Woods " to life on the Williams 
Theatre stage. 

In addition to extensive work as 
a costume designer, "Into the 
Woods" director, Craig A. 
Humphrey is a local celebrity for his 
recent productions of "Once Upon a 
Matlress," "The Fanlasticks," and 
"A Funny Thing Happened on the 
Way to the Forum." His return to 
the Fort Wayne area should be well 
anticipated. 

Tickets for Ihe production are 
on sale at the Williams Theatre box 
office or call 481-6555. 

Prices for "Into the Woods" are 
$12 for general admission. S10 for 
IPFW faculty and staff, S8 for senior 
citizens and students and S5 for 
IPFW students with a valid student 
I.D. 

Groups of 10 and over can con- 
tact the box office for special rates. 
Visa. Mastercard and Discover 
cards are all accepted. 

Inio the Woods will ran on April 
17, 18, 24, 25, May 1 and 2. Cunain 
time for all performances is 8 p.m.

Staff Writer 

Caught somewhere 
between winter and 
spring. Bob casually 
pul on his coal and vol- 
unteered to drive the alco- 
hol buyer to the liquor store. 

Il was a routine trip for him 
so he didn't feel any hesitancy 
over the two beers he just drank. 
Everything was feeling good. 

They walked out to Bob's broth- 
er's car and his passenger put his 
bag in the back as they got in and 
left. 

As he didn't know the 
guy, Bob was a little 
uncomfortable opening up 
a conversation with the man. 

They had a few common friends 
at the party they spoke fluently 
about though, as the ten mile trip to 
the liquor store began to pass by like 
it was nothing 

Pretty soon, Bob was paying 
more attention to his new-found 
friend than he was the road. 

That may have been why he did- 
n't notice the stop sign or the police 
car following him. 

As he saw the lights of the car 
go on. Bob knew he'd made a fatal 
error in judgment by drinking right 
before he left. 

He pulled slowly into the closest 
parking lot that he could find. 

After passing the officer's sobri- 
ety test, Bob was given a 
Breathalyser test, which he sadly 
failed. 

The state's new "no tolerance 
for minor" law saw to that. 

After being told by the officer 
that being the driver of the vehicle 
made him accountable for all that 
was found inside the car, Bob 
watched reluctantly as the officer's 
partner pulled out his "buddy's" 




bag, filled with drag paraphernalia , 
and his brother's hunting knife from 
under the driver's side seat. 

After word got 
back from the sta- 
tion that his broth- 
er's insurance had 
dropped him two 
months ago, the police 
d no problem bringing 
Bob and the other guy in. 
Despite die police having 
let the possession of a con- 
cealed weapon charge go that 
they threatened Bob with, he 
was still in some, serious 
trouble as they let 
the guy he was 
driving to the 
liquor store go 
and charged Bob with every- 
thing. 

They even charged him 
with driving an uninsured car, 
even though it wasn't his in J 
the first place, / 

He couldn't believe .$?" 
all of this was happening .' 
to him, no matter how | 
many times he pinched 
his arm. 

Even though he was 
completely sober by then, 
ihe police decided il 
would teach him a lesson 
by pulling him in the 
"drank tank," a room that 
slanted to a drain in the 
middle that smelled hor- 
rible. 

Nine hours later, he 
was more than willing to 
go with the guards to 
general holding. 



He was ready when they firsi 
put him in there. 

After a brief, yet frustrating con- 
versation with his lawyer, Bob 
found out his bail would be set in 
two days. 

It didn't matter though, as Bob 
knew loo well that he couldn't 
afford il, nor could anyone he knew 

His friends were all cautious in 
helping him due lo the serious 
nature of the charges against him 
and his parents had all but aban- 
doned him the second ihey found 
out he'd been arrested for posses- 
sion of narcotics 




Bob realized he was on bis own on 
Ihis one, and quickly though! up a 
plan. 

After contemplating his silua- 
lion the few weeks before his hear- 
ing. Bob found that his only possi- 
bility was for a plea bargain, despite 
how fake the charges seemed to him. 
His chances at school were hopeless 
now, as he'd already missed loo 
much class lo pass the semester any- 
way and, if convicted, his chances of 
getting inlo a decent college were 
shol. 

His only hope for a decent 
Jmiiiiv was to get his lawyer to bar- 
gain for a ihree-year stint in the 
army, just like he saw desper- 
ate people do' in the movies in 
his situation. When his hear- 
ing came around, ihe judge 
acquiesced under the stipula- 
tion that Bob paid the S500 he 
owed the courts and kept his 
record clean. 

If he did, the courts would go 
"easy" on him and give him a year 
- not loo bad considering the 
charges. 

Bob ran into trouble after bis 
release, though. 

It seemed thai word had gotten 
around about his arrest and no one 
wanted to hire him. 

His parents allowed him to live 
at home, though grudgingly, and still 
adamantly refused to pay what Bob 
owed. 

In the end. Bob goi a year in a 
minimum -sec uriiy prison for doing 
something that he really didn't do.

Grand Theft Auto: CURKSVILLE 



Gran Roberts and Pat Carter 



Madness and Mayhem at its Best 



By Kelly Bergman 
Features Editor 



Do you like games thai lei you 
drive vehicles like a roadman, and 
when things don'l go your way you 
pull out a gun and go nuts? 

I possibly have found ihe game 
for you. 

It's called "Grand Theft Auto." 
This action game allows you to be 
the bad boy or bad girl that you 
have always wanted to be. 

The most simplistic way to 
describe this game is to compare it 
to other games. 

The format looks very much 
like the game "Postal." It's level of 
mayhem is also comparable. Take 
that and add it to the driving style 
of "Destruction Derby" and you 
have one bell of a game. 

As the title might imply, the 
game is about stealing cars, but it 
is a Utile more complicated than 
Ui.it For mc the hardest thing was 
picking which vehicle to steal. 
Imagine trying to decide between a 
Dodge Viper, a Jaguar, a Corvette 
Stingray, a school bus or a fuel 
tanker. 

These are just some of the 
options available and if you dare 
you can even jack a police car. 
Some of the other vehicles include 
city buses, taxis and VW Beetles. 

All of the vehicles operate as 
differently as they do in real life. 

To make things a little 
more difficult there is pressure 
for you to be as reckless as you 
can. Besides having the cops on 
your tail, the mobster that 
employs you 
makes sure that 
you stay on task. 

The game 
allows you to 
choose beiween- 
four different" 1 L 
characters that you can name at 
your own discretion. The charac- 
ters have different aljRjlks^dyou 1 
can choose the one that best suits 
you. 

There are ^r*. 4&amp;L. 
things to ^^^^rf\- 
pick up 

arounc' 

the city 

that you 

: from 



head view. 

You can pick up handguns, 
machine guns, extra lives, body 
armor and get out of jail free 
cards. 

The main plot of the game 
revolves around your ability to 
avoid the police, steal vehicles 
and complete missions. 

Missions vary for all of the 
different cities, but I can tell you 
they include picking up and drop- 
ping off vehicles, reclaiming 
stolen properly and assassina- 
tions. 

If you get bored with the mis- 
sions that the game gives you. I 
have a few things to suggest. 

Try jacking several cars and 
blocking off an intersection, mak- 
ing all of the traffic stop. 

As several cars begin to build 
up, the fun is to just begin. Pull 
out your hand gun and start chas- 
ing and shooting at pedestrians. 

It won't lake too long and the 
police car sirens will start to be 
heard. 

Run back to where all of the 
traffic is piled up and get your 
machine gun out. 

As soon as you get a few offi- 
cers close to the cars, open fire. 

The cars will blow up and the 
police officers will catch on fire. 
This will score you major points in 
the game

kind of realistic violence, but this 
is an exception. 

It's just that this game is so 
entertaining. Just remember that 
it's just a game. 

It's not real. 

As you can imagine, this game 
has caused some controversy over-

pedestrians. 
_j. This is more 
difficult than it sounds because the 
pedestrians will scream and run 
away if you miss them. You score 
very little points this way unless 
you happen to come across this 
large group of joggers. 

If you hit them all in one try 
you get somewhere around ten- 
thousand points. 

I normally do not condone this 



seas where it was originally 
released. 

This game is only available on 
PC and Sony Playstation formats. 
According to the distributor, 
they have no plans to release it on 
Sega Saturn, N64, Mac or any 
other format. 

On the PC. the game comes in 
three different forms for your gam- 
ing pleasure. 
There's ai 

works very well, but does- 
have the levels 
of detail that 
the others

that has 

great detail. 

and is perfect 

; the average gamer. 

The big enchilada is the 

3DFx version. To put it lightly, 

this monster runs so fast that it's 

almost unimaginable. 

So if you are looking for a 
game that lets you tear up the town 



and do almost everything outside away with it "Grand Theft Auto" i 
of Ihe law, and pretty much get just the game for you.

Music Industry Suffers Losses 



By Kelly Bergman 
Features Editor 

In the past week, two members 
of the music world passed away 
One known for her ability, and her 
warm country songs. The other is 
more known for the controversy 
that be stirred up more than for any 
talent that be may have possessed 

I admit that I am not a country 
fan. but I know that some of you 
out there are. Tami Wynette, known 
for her song "Stand by Your Man," 
passed away last weekend: All I 
really have to say about her is that 
if you were a fan of hers, sorry for 
your loss. I'm sure you will miss 
her. She was 55. 

I know many of you remember 
the controversy that I am going to 
talk about. Back in 1988 there was 
a new hit duo that was given a 
Grammy as the Best New Artists. 
Not long after they stepped into 
their spotlight, it was taken away 
from them. The duo was caught up 
in a web of deceiL and lip-synch- 
ing. They were one of the first man- 
ufactured pop groups, long before 
the Spice Girls were even thought 
of. All of you remember Milli 
Vanilli. It seems that one of the 
members just never recovered. Rob 



Pilatus passed away last Friday 
after taking a lethal dose of pre- 
scription drugs and alcohol. Before 
be was half of the duo, Rob was a 
dancer and was said to have some 
potential in a singing career. After 
seeing some of the pictures of Rob 
in the last few years, it was obvious 
to me that he was not doing as well 
as he had in the spotlight. He was 
32.

Have you ever wondered who is 
behind the scenes on whai happens 
al Commencement? Who puis 
together the newsletter thai tells you 
everything you need to know about 
graduation? Well, wonder no longer. 

The Student Ambassador 
Council is a group of devoted stu- 
dents who are recommended by 
department chairs, deans, and vari- 
ous other administrators who regu- 
larly interact with students. 

Members of the council attend 
meetings to help prepare graduation 
and everything in between to make 
it the best ever. 

Members of the council join one 
of three committees- the communi- 
cations committee, which puts 
together the newsletter for the grad- 
uating class: the party committee, 
which plans the post-commence- 
ment celebration; and the gift com- 
mittee, which puts together 
fundraising efforts to present a gift 
from the graduating class. 

So everything from choosing the 
ink and paper colors to who is going 
to blow up all those balloons for the 
party is the council's responsibility. 



To slay active on the committee. 
students must attend numerous 
meetings and fulfill several commit- 
tee requirements. They are students 
with leadership, creativity and loyal- 
ly lo the university. 

When graduation day finally 
arrives, the student ambassadors get 
a chance lo stand back and take a 
look at their achievements in mak- 
ing the entire graduating class happy 
and proud of where they are today. 

They are a group of hard-work- 
ing students who have your best 
interests in mind.

Biggest mystery on TV since J.R. 



Last week. Comedy Central 
failed to deliver on its promise of 
the identity of South Park's Eric 
Carrman's faiher. 

South Park creators Trey Parker 
and Malt Sione decided to play an 
April Fools Day joke on their fans 
and instead made ihe bizarrely 
unfunny, "Not without my anus." 

The cartoon featured Terrence 
and Phillip, two characters loosely 
based on Dcavis and Buithead. 

Most of the time they fan and 
that is about the limit of their com- 



edy value. 

Comedy Central received sev- 
eral e-mails and phone calls from 
irate fans who were irked about the 
joke. 

Here are our guesses on 
Cartman's paternity: 
Nol Beckley: 

John Elway, quarterback for the 
Denver Broncos.

The mens volleyball learn won 
on Friday night by sweeping a 

three-game malch againsi Rulgers- 
Newark but fell on Saturday night 



against Penn State in four games. 
The loss dropped the Dons record to 
16-4 overall. With the completion 
of the regular season the Dons 
attention now turns lo the 
Midwestern Intercollegiate 
Volleyball Association (MIVA) 



toumey. 

The tourney's first round 
matchups have Lewis vs 
Mercyhurst, Ohio Stale vs Clarke 
College. IPFW vs Quincy and 
Loyola vs Ball Slate. The four win- 
ners advance to Ball Stale where the 



championship is being held. If the 
scedings hold true IPFW will face 
Lewis and Ohio State will take on 
Loyola on Friday, April 17. The 
championship will be held on 
Saturday, April 18. 

Even though the Dons crushed 
Quincy earlier in the season 3-0 
Coach Amie Ball feck that they 
are a better team then their record 
shows. 

"Quincy just beat Mercyhurst in 
three straight, and it took us five 
games to beat Mercyhurst." said 
Ball. "If we look past them we 
might not even make it to 
Muncie." 

The game againsi Quincy will 
be held here on Saturday, April 1 1 , 
al 7:30 p.m. Quincy is 8-14 over- 
all and 3-7 in the conference but 
has been winning towards the end 
of the season. 

Hector Solo has been playing 
well but the opposing teams have 
started to serve to him on a con- 
sistent basis which Ball feels 
wears on him. 

"It doesn't wear him down 

physically but the constant serving 

starts to take a mental loll," said 

Ball. 

For fans who want to attend (he 

maiches at Ball State the phone 

number to call is (765)-28S-1475. 

All MIVA maiches will be held at

bringing the teams record to 1-4 for 
ihe week, 17-9 overall and 2-6 in the 
conference. 

"The piichers are balding but 
they are just getting heat," said 
Coach Tony Vutorio. "Our offense 
has been great and our defense has 
been great but we aren't winning," 

Offense and defense are helping 
the Dons stay above .500. As a team 
the Dons arc hilling .315 and field- 
ing al a 967 rale. 

Another big plus is that the team 
continues to run well on the base 
paths. The have stolen 29 bases in 
just 21 games so far white only 
being thrown out only eight times. 

Jason Jaffe has led the charge at 
the plate after a slow start. He is 
batting .390 with 5 homeruns and 23 
runs balled in. 

"Jaffe is on fire right now and 



playing really good ball," said 
Viltorio. 

The Dons return to home action 
on Friday with a doubleheader 

against Southern Indiana at noon 
and on Saturday against Kentucky 
Weslyan in a double header thai also 
starts at noon. 



Who to pick 



By Tony Laux 
Sports Editor 

On April 18 and 19 the NFL 
Draft will take place in New York 
and the decisions on who to lake 
have to be considered. 

The Indianapolis Colls have 
the number one pick overall and 
with the dumping of Jim "Caplain 
Comeback" a.k.a. "Lieulcnanl 
Loser" Harbaugb to the Baltimore 
Ravens, they will pick either 
Peyton "Barely" Manning "to win" 
or Ryan "Burnin"' Leaf. But 
which one? 

Peyion Manning has the size 
and strength to lake the beating thai 
the sieve of an offensive line will 
give up. But did he use loo much 
of his talent at Tennessee? 

Ryan Leaf is young and ener- 
getic bui his skills aren't as pol- 
ished as Manning's. Since the Colls 
feci that they are only a player or 
two away from regaining their 
playoff form they will probably 
draft Manning because be won't 
lake as long to develop. 

This also becomes a factor with 
the aging of Marshall Faulk who 
must take some of (he offensive 
burdenoff of Manning. If the Colts 
take Leaf he will have to learn the 
skills that it lakes lo be an NFL 
quarterback and unfortunately mat 
takes time which Faulk doesn't 
have. 

The Arizona Cardinals are try- 
ing to shop their number 3 pick lo 
ihe Chicago Bears and the Saint 
Louis Rams lo try and draft a run- 
ning back. The Bears want lo draft 
Andre Wadsworth, a defensive end 
with speed and size, but unfortu- 
nately so do ihe Rams. 

Since the Cardinals are looking 
for a running back the Bears have 
reportedly offered Rashaan "I 
haven't met a fumble that 1 haven't 
loved" Salaam and Alonzo "Loose 
Screws" Spellman and the number 
5 pick to move up. 

The running backs thai Arizona 
has been looking at are Curtis "I'll 



take the blue suii" Enis and Fred "I 
couldn'i make ii at Nebraska" 
Taylor. Enis was the Big Ten 
Offensive Player of the Year but he 
reminds me way loo much of Ki- 
Jana Carter. Taylor played at 
Florida and it leaves his numbers a 
little suspect when he only has to 
run againsi three linemen and eight 
defensive backs. 

Whal aboul the "humble" 
Charles Woodson? He already has 
his "cell phone" posse to reinforce 
his belief that he is "god" The 
Raiders arc looking at drafting "his 
holiness." Doesn't it make a per- 
fect malch?
