White that's unlikely. IPFW 
students have noticed Ihe ongoing 
wintry conditions this year.

Hepner's feelings i

The IPFW Superintendent 
of Grounds noted her crew has 
been busy plowing this season. 
'This has probably Ijcen one of 
the snowier winters in Ihe last 
three or four years," Janet Kelly 
said, Kelly has been here for 10 
years, she explained. 

Hepner credils IPFW with 
doing a good job on campus 
when it comes to the snowfall. "I 
am really happy about how they 
have been Icceping Ihe ground 
cleaned off and salted," 



Chcislensen 

idicated she is sick 
of the winler. "I hale il. 1 don't 
like anything under 80 degrees," 
she said, smiling. "It's a little 
worse than most.'' 

The IPFW geosciences 
department maintains a Website 
at htlpi//geo,ipfw,edu/www/ 
geo weather /quickLook.hlml 
which gives a glance at on-cam- 
pus conditions, including wind, 
nigh and low lempcralurc and 
precipitation. 

Clarence Tennis is the 
geoseience department's 
technician and maintains the 
Web site. After living in San 
Diego for aboul 16 years. Tennis 
relumed lo Fort Wayne in 1996, 
He says this year has been colder 
and snowier than most recently, 
"It seems colder this year. 
reminds me of the winter of 
197B."Tennis added. 

And he IS right. It has been 
slightly colder than normal, but 
(at from record-breaking. 

The coldest winler on 
record is the one Tei\nis recalls: 



1978. During that winter. *then

In fact, the 20OZ-Z003 winter 
likely won't be in the Top 10. 
December's average temperature 
was 28,8, just 0.2 degrees lower 
than averaee. January was 
aboul five degrees less than 
average at 18.4 degrees, while 
February currently has a daily 
averaee of 24.4 degrees. 

"It sounds bad, but it's only 
2.1 degrees below normal," 
Sabones commented. "1 don't 
think we're going to make the 
Top to cold list for ivinle(s...but 
we're going to have a below-

and one million males in the United 
States arc battling eating disorders 
like anorexia, bulimia or binge eating 
disorder. 



•Anorcsia has the highest mortality 
rate ol any menial illness. 

Eating disorders ate affecting 
people at younger ages Ihan ever 
before. According to the National 
Eating Disorders Association Web 
Site, 42 percent of first through third 
grade girls want to be thirmcr, and 
over half ol all nine and ten-year-old 
~irls feel betlcr about themselves if

has developed a number of programs 
to teach elementary students about 
the dangers of eating disorders. They 
have also instituted a program for 
high school girls and sponsor a loll- 
free, nation-wide help line. 
Operators distribute information, 
lend support and give referrals to the 
1,200 callers who phone in each 
month. The help line number is l-SDO-

Deaf World event to invite participants to experience silent communication 



On Tljcsday, March 4. from 
) 9 p.m., students, faculty and 
nmunity members are invited 
lo turn off their voices and turn 
on Ihcir minds in Ihe Walb 
Ballroom for the fifth aiuiual 
"It's A Deaf, Deaf, Deaf, Deaf 
World" event. Sponsored by the 
ASL PAH! Club, the immersion 
game will provide people an 
opportunity to have fun and 
possibly earn prizes by

Edison, president ol ASL PAHI. 
"We have various stations set up 
that are supposed lo be like real- 
life situations that deaf people 
experience on a daily basis, 
whether a bank, a restaurant, a 
hospital |orl electronics store." 

Set up as a game. Edison 
noted that participants will be 
allowed to communicate by 
using American Sign Language 



(ASL), gestures, fadal expressions — 
anything but voices.

you are having problems, you 
can use pen ana paper if you 
don't know [ASL]. But. you try 
to use gestures, and we hope 
that maybe somewhere along 
the line, you can use sign." 

Although prior knowledge 
of ASL is helpful, Edison says 
that it is not necessary to play 
the game. "No experience is 

knowing sign language is not a 
requirement." she said. Also, for 
those who may struggle to 
communicate without signing, 
there will also be a simulated 
ASL school in the Deaf-World.

coison said, "Or, you don't even

just walk over and ask Ihem to

As parlicipanls enter the 
event, fhey will receive a sheet of 
paper explaining the event with 
a starting station and situ- 
alion that begins their 
journey through the simulated 
Deaf-World. "After that, it is

In addition to the stations.

will visit the information desk at

Addilionally. a parlid pant's 
success in the game is dependent 
on their silence not just at the

At the close of the game 
portion of the event, a deaf 
speaker will talk for the last half 
hour including what Ihey think 
.-iboul Ihe stations and how they 
felt when Ihey were commum- 
cating. Edison noted that it this 
portion is also about getting 
feedback and addressing ques- 
tions from Ihe participants. 

Edison feels that events 
such as Ihe Deaf-World event are 
important because Ihey are "trying 
to give you abitof undcrstanduigf 
about deaf culture. She adds that 
those inexperienced communi- 
cating with the deaf shouldn't 
feel nervous or uncomfortable 

"Deaf people are like any 
other people," she said. "They're 
there for a good lime (and) that's 
what you should be going for. 
It's |ust a fun experience. It's 
something that is maybe going 
to open your eyes to a different 



aspecl of the world. . to give you 
a little bit ol understanding to 
other people." 

T&gt;ie Deaf-World event is 
also a chance for beginning ASL 
students to oracllcc their signing

Parking not the problem 

°^"'"""""" It's the drive that matters 



Wilh IPFVV 
being 3 commulcrcampiu, the 
sludenls here have lo des) with 

students elsewhere don't 
have lo Ihink Jbout. From 
adverse weather lo ranJom car 
troubles and from traffic jams 
to parking, we've got lo Figure 
i&gt;uta way to deal wilh it. 

We've all heard aboul Ihe 
parking issues, especially in the 
earl)' stages of each semester. 
These problems usually die 
down after a few weeks of 
classes when some students gel 
in the swing of things and start 
skipping. 

One problem never seems 
to go away, though. And Ihal 
prciblein is drivers who just 
don'l know how todrive. 

My apartment is on the 
southwest side of Fort Wayne, 
and each morning 1 have to 
choose whether lo fight Ihe 
inlerslate idiots on 1-69 or the 
cily psychos ui downlo^vn, 1 
usually lake the highway in 
hopes that it wilfbe less 
congested, but I still manage lo 
find a few bad drivcis. 

There arc (hree basic kinds 
o! bad drivers: overactive, 
paranoid, procraslinalors and 
just plain slow. 

Overactive drivers are 
tvpically lecn-agc girls who 
Inmk Ihey can save lime by 
going through their moming 
routine on their way lo school 



while loking witi 
passenger in the vehicle. K 



Keep 



The females in this group 
are usually behind thewhcMilof 
the 2003 BMW Iheif parents 
boughl them, putting on their 
makeup, doing their hair, 
painting Iheir nails, changing 
their shoes and eating breakfast 
(or at leasl chomping on gum), 
all while having an in-depth 

ersation with their best 
friend on their cell phone about 
lasl night's episode of "The 
Bacheloieltc." 

I don't mean lo Single out 
Ihe gals here, though. I've seen 
males ivho fil this bill, too. 1 
was passed the other day by a 
guy talking on his cell phone. 



mind that 1 drive aboul 70 
mph on 1-69, and this guy was 
passmg me. 

Paranoid drivers are those 
who see a stale trooper coming 
so they sland on their brake 
pedal to lower thcirspeed from 
90 (o 65 mph in 0,2 seconds. 
This causes even people who 
follow more than (he 
recommended Ihree seconds 
behind the driver to slam on 
their brakes, leading to a domino 
effect. 

Somewhere along Ihe line 
there is an overactive driver 
who fails to realize thai the 50 
cars ahead of him arc pmctically 
slowing to a stop, and a traffic- 
stoppmg pile-up ciuues. 

And 1 have news for all 
suddenly stopping paranoid 
drivers. It you can see the slale 
trooper, he can see you and has 
probably already made note of 
your excessive speed. In olher 
words, you have already been 
caughl, so there is no need to 
even try to slow down, 

I run into. ..well. I see 
procrastinators nearly every 
morning on my way to campus. 
Procrastinators are Ihe drivers 
who know they have lo be in a 
certain lane well in advance, 
yet Ihey wail until the last 100 
feet to even Iry lo gel inlo Ihat 
lane. By Ihis point, they're 
forced to come lo a complete, 
slop in Ihe middle of the road 
until either someone lets them 
over Of there's a break in (he 
traffic flow. 

I deal with these drivers 
regularly at the interseclion of 
St. |oc and Si. Joe Center 
Roads. Knowing that I'll have 
to make a right turn al the 
inleisectlon, I usually Iry to gel 
inlo the right lane. Once I'm 
where I need to be, eight cars 
driven by college-age students 
;£oom past me. As they cross 
the bridge over the St. Joseph 
River near the Marketplace of 
Canterbury, they all slow lo a 



halt, hoping that 

the bum per- to-bum per trainc 

in the right lane will kindly lei 

Why should those of us in 
Ihe right lane lei them over? We 
knew to be in the right lane, 
and aflM driving to campus a 
few times, the procrastinators 
should have learned lo gel over 

Finally, jusi plam slow 
drivers aren't jusl those who 
never drive over Ihe speed 
limit. These drivers often do 
other things that make me 
believe they arc just plain slow 
in Ihe head- 

Of course, there are the 
slow drivers who leave their 
blinker on lor miles after himing 
or changing lanes without 
clicking and those who never 
waste their precious energy lo 
even click on Iheir blinker. 

Recently, though, I have 
found the drivers who have no 
due how to merge. 

[3n multiplt 
over the last cour 
have been behind 
an on-ramp to 1-69, Instead of 
gettine up lo speed and 
smoothly blending inlo Ira f fie, 
Ihe driver correctly slows 
down lo find a place to fit in, 
and when the opening doesn't 
come along. Ihey completely 

How safe is that? Now 
instead of al leasl having a 
rolling slart heading inlo the 
interstate traffic, they have to 
go from zero to 65 mph as fast 
as possible, which isn't very 
fast ui some cars. 

Once again, there will be 
an overactive driver coming, 
and when the slow driver pulls 
inlo Ihe flow of Iralfic, Ihe 
overachve driver will fail lo see 
the slow driver ahead, instantly 
becorne paranoid and slam on 
their brakes, causing a traffic 
jam that keeps a piocrastmator 
in Ihe ]eft lane from gelling lo 
their off-famp jusl past ihe' 

It will also make me late 
for class.

1 would like to begin b^

many college professors who 
would nol even take Ihe time to 
pick up their own school's 
newspaper, let alone wrile let- 
ters to the editor. That bemg 
said, I am going to take an enor-

progranu the government lakes 
over, the less control we as citi- 
zens have over our own lives. 

The liberals in Ihis country 
tiave lumed us inlo a nation of 
special interests, where the 
minority groups are often 
catered to, despite protests from 
the rest of Ihe country. In an 
effort to be tolerant of every 
group, we have lost the sense of 
morality that made us a 
great nation In the past. By

According lo Merrian 
Webster's Collegiate 
Dictionary (10th ed.). 
an empire is defined as. 
"A major polihcal ui\it 
having territory of 
great exlent or a num- 

pies under a single sov- 
ereign authority." Does 
Ihis sound like America 
lo you? 

The British Empire had 13 
colonies in Ihe United Stales 
before we ivon our independ- 
ence, but at the present time the 
United States has no coloiues or 
territories of which I am aware. 
There is no American governor 
of Australia, there is no United 
Stales head of state ruling over 
Germany and we don't have a 
regional magistrate controlling 
Ihe territory of Israel. Therefore, 
it dcM?sn't sound like there is an 
"American Empire" to me. 

The United Stales may 
have troops stationed in several 
countries, but we do not main- 
tain mililary control over any 
nalion at the present time, if 
we were a true empire, instead 
of reluming nolilical control 
of Japan and Germany to its 
citizens after World War II, we 
ivould" have Installed perma- 
nent American leadership in 
those countries. (Granted, 
President Bush probably wishes 
Germany was an American ter- 
ritory with all the trouble he is 
getting from Schroeder recenUy). 
Likewise, if the reason behind 
miUlary action in Iraq is an 
imperialistic desire to control 
oil, we would have taken it after 
Desert Storm,

and n?-giDup befoie going in lo

you see my point here? Calling 
the United Stales an empire is 
akin to calling the former Soviet

All talk of empires aside, 1 
will agree that America has not 
only been declining, but teeter- 
ing on the edge of a catastrophic 
fall for nearly a decade. This is 

"empire," but due to a continued 
effort to direct our coujiIt)' awaj" 
from the principles on which it 
was founded. The United States 
is a Democratic Republic. This 
country was founded on uidividual 
freedom and personal rights. Out 
gcnerrunoit was created to pmled 
us, not pmvide for us. 

Trie individual citizens 
have always been responsible for 
providing their own livelihood. 
Our free market economy allows 
individuals lo make as much 
money as Ihey can and provide 
whatever luxuries they can 
afford for llienisclves lyithoul 
government in terferen&lt;;e. If any 
of our citizens are willing lo 
work hani, gel an education or 
learn a skill, there will always be 
opportunities to succeed. , 

Even those with a minimal 
education can make a very good 
living in Ihis country if Ihey 
have a skill or can provide a 
service that is in demand. 
America has survived for 
200 years following this 
philosophy of individual 
choice, personal responsibility 
and consumer demand, 
becoming Ihe economic 
model Ihat olher countries in 
the world strive lo become. 

There has been a huge 
push from the liberal left to turn 
America into a socialist country 
in the last 10 years. Theemphasis 
has been moved from the 
individual bemg responsible 
for determining his own income 
level and standard of living to 
an agenda of government enti- 
tlements and social programs.

great country to return to a sys- 
tem of values and morality that 
served so well in Ihe past. 

We have grown weary of 
the world (and many on the left) 
exhibiting a "Blame America 
First" attitude. Professor 
ladicola, this country has done 
more to preserve peace and 
oppose tyranny in the worU than 
any other country in history. More 
American blood has been 
spilled defending the rest of the 
world from invasion and 
oppression than by any govern- 
ment in existence. When we 
defend Ihe weak and oppressed 
of other countries, the world 
acts as though we were obligated 
lo do so. Why then is there such 
an outcry when America tries to 
defend itself for a change?

Letter to the Editor: Protests 



I am a -lo-ycar-old Christian married lather 
of two who usually considers himself to be a 
liberal, but I feel 1 need to speak out against Ihe 
sO'callcd peace prolcslers. 1 grew up during the 
Viclnam War (police action), and it really hurt to 
see the daily body count (315 United Stales vs. 
2,100 Viet Cong or something like that). 

Our soldiers were drafted and (ew were 
voluntary, Johnson used the so-called Gulf of 
Tonkin incident ( Yeah, like Ihe North Vietnamese 
had an ability to fire on United Stales naval 
vessels during a bad storm) to escalate the war 
beyond reason. After so many years of installing 
a puppet govenuncnl and not firiiting lo win, wc 
needed protests to end Ihe war. Once Nixon tried 
lo ficht It and gel it over with, we were too sick ol 
the righting lo do anything bul with withdraw. 

However, diplomacy is like a big poker 
game. Today's prolcslers protesting a war wilh 
Iraq before il has even begun is counterproduc- 
tive. These protesters are leaning lowanJjtreason 
and Ihcse do-gooders are giving this modem day 

situation that will kill more United States troops. 
The last thing that Ihe govemmeni wants is 
war bul "So Damn Insane" wants his power at 
any cost.,Do Ihcse protesters forget what he has 
done lo his oivn people, let alone lo Kuwait? 
They show what happens when people ore 
around depleted uranium. Why not show 

poisoned Ihe Kurds? Why not show ^vh^t liis 
IcDops did to the zoo or the foreign nationals that 
they raped? 

I received an E-mail from a friend who does 
nol have attributions, but 1 believe they could be 
verified, 

II was 1987. At a lecture the other day. they 
^vea' playing an old news video of LI. Col. Oliver 
North lestifying at Ihe Iran-Contra hearings 
during Ihe Reagan Administration. There was 
Ollie in front of God and country getlmg Ihe third 
d^rcc, bul what he said was stunning! He was 
being drilled by a senator, "Did you nol recently 
spend close to S60XI00 for a home secunly system?" 

Ollie replied, "Yes, I did, sir." The senator 
continued, trying to gel a laugh out of the 
audience, "Isn't that jusia little excessive?" 

"No, sir," Ollie continued. 

"No? And why nol?" the senator asked. 




friends (if you have any). 



J? Ihe lives ol my family and 1 ii 



questioned. 

"By a terrorist, sir" Ollie answered 

"Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly 
scare you that much?" 

"His name is Osama bin Laden, sir," OIhe 
replied . 

At Ihis poml Ihe senator tried to repeat the 
name, but couldn't pronounce it, which most 
people back then probably couldn't. A couple of 
people laughed at the atlempl. 

Then the senator continued, "Why are you 
so afraid of lliis man? " 

"Because, sir, he is the mosi evil person alive 
that I know of," Ollie answered. 

"And what do you recommend we do about 
him?" asked the senator. 

"Wfell, sir, if il was up lo me, I would recommend 
tfiat an assassin team be formed lo eliminate him 
and his men from the face of Ihe earth." 

The senator disagreed with this approach, 
and Ihal was all Ihal was shown ol the clip By Ihe 
way. that senator was Al Core. 

Also: Terrorist pilot Mohammad Alia bletv 
up a bus in Israel in 19S6. The Israelis captured, 
Ined and imprisoned him. As part of the Oslo 
agreement with the Palestinians in 1993, Israel 
had lo agree lo release so-called "political prison- 
However, the Israelis would nol release any 
wilh blood on their hands. The American president 
al the lime. Bill Clinton and his secretary of state, 
VVarren Christopher, "insisted" that all prisoners 
be released. 

Thus Mohammad Alta was freed and 
eventually thanked Ihe United Slates by flying an 
airplane into Tower One of the World Trade 
Center. This was reported by many of the 
American TV networks al t)v hme that Ifie terrorists 
were firsi identified. It was censored in the 
United Stales from all bier reports.

Amidst the lighb, the glamour and 
of course, the music, rccording artisls 
from all over the globe came lo honor 
each other al the 45lh Annual 
Grammy Awards on Sunday night. 

This was Ihe triumphant return 
of the Crammys lo New York after a 
five year absence in the Big Apple. 

This Grammy Awards 
ceremony was different from previ- 
ous ones betause instead of having 
one host for the entire ceremony, there 
was 3 collection of hosts. 

One such host ivjs the slightly 
haggard-looking Dustm Holhnan. 
who pronounced legend Bruce 
Springsteens name 

"Springstreet," 

The night was highlighted by 

Grformances by artists such as Avril 
vigne, who almost came through 
charming the audience with her sin- 
gle "SkSt Boi." Eminem, backed by 
hip hop greats the Roots, also made 



Eminem also drifted from tradi- 
tion when hedid not thank his family, 
friends or those who worked on his 
album 'The Eminem Show," which 
won Best Rap Album. 

Instead, Eminem thanked a host 
of emcees who influenced him includ- 
ing Run DMC, Ja Rule and Dr. Die. 

However, the real success story 
of the nighl IV as 23-year-old jaM-pop 
artist, Norah (ones, whose album 
"Come Away wilh Me" took away 
five awards including Best New 
Artist. Best Pop Vocal Album and Best 
Album of the Ye 



Jon 
J few by surpris 



at there 



a^bu 



took 



welt- 



some wfiat more popular 
known records by the likes ot 
Michelle Branch, the DixieChicks and 
Bruce Springsteen. 

It is not fully understood by 
many Ifiat the Grammys are voted by 
miiers, engineers and producers who 
favor albums thai require more pro- 
duction and lechnical skill. 



With this in mind, it is not really 
a surprise that Jones, the classically 
trained vocalist and pianist, won as 
many awards as she did. 

Maiiy tributes were paid durine 
the night as well as the traditional 
nominee performances. 

Such a tribute was Ihe a capella 
■ by 'Nsync, who paid 



harmonious Maunce Gibb of Ihe Bee 

' Nsync' s medley of Bee Gees 
lunes served to span the 
influences (he Brolners Gibb have on 
today's popular culture and aL^i dis- 
played Ihe depth of variely the Bee 
Gees put into their music. It also 
helpcci identify where their current 
influence has come from. 

Perhaps the mosi touching per- 
formance of the night came from 
Dave Grohl, Bruce Springsteen and 
Elvis Costcllo as they remembered 
punk legend Joe Strummer ot the 
Clash 

Whtn the rock legends hit Ihc 
stage along with others such .is No 



and the E Street Band, they 
rocked Ihe house wilh the Clash's 
classic "London Calling.' 

It brought home Ihc fact that 
many of the people who are well- 
influenced by many subcultural and 
counter cultural icons, like Stnimmcr. 

Popular cullure tends to take its 
roots for granted, and where it is that 
they came from is through revolu- 
tions such as the one of which 
Slrummer was pari ui Ihe 1970s. 

So maybe now. in death, Joe 
Strummer can Ije heard.

They may say that they're 
"too dumb to be rich and

in on that status 

Upbeat punk at its non- 
poppy best. Let people listen lo 
them and you'll likely get one of 
livo replies: "They sound just 
like Good Charlotte" ot 
"They're Good Charlolte 
wannabes." Bui no. they're no 
wannabes. Drummer Aaron 
Escolopio actually was in Good 
Charlotte at one lime. 

Escolopio was the drummer 
for Good Cnarlolle during their 
first run in 2000 when Ihcy 
released their self-tilled debut. 
Shortly into 2001 Escolopio left

After independently releasing 
Iheir self-lilted EP, Wakefield 
signed a conlract wilh Ihc well-

To say their EP was stellar 
is Ihc understalement of the 
decade. Highlighted by three

operimented with several

IPFW blows out Raiders in final home game 

Season's largest crowd on hand to watch Dons' victory at coHseum 




IPFW's David Simon slams home two points during Saturday's game 
against Wright Slate at the Memorial Coliseum. The Mastodons topped 
the Raiders 84-61. 



In whal may have been ihe biggesl 
game in Ihe history of IPFW men's baskelbalL 
the Maslodoru came out and dominated 
Wright Slatp finishing up Iheir "loumamcnl 
week" in style 

The final home gome of Ihe year, 
which was pbyed at the Coliseum, allracted 
3,113 fans, the largcsl crowd of the year. 

A unique atmosphere pervaded 
throughout as many tans came lo see North 
Side graduate Vemard HoUins' return to 
Fort Wayne. 

Slill other; came lo take advantage of 
Fjn Appreciation Day as cheerleaders 
Ihrciv lilerally thousands of T-shirts, fnsbees 
and mini-basketballs to the screaming fans 
during almost every Kmcout. 

S%l others came to recognize the 
team's Iwo seniors' last game in Fori 
Wayne as guard Brad Noll attempted to 
reach 1,000 career points. 

The lirsl half was a hard-fought back- 
and-forlh battle that featured sharp plays 
from both teams. On the sixth possession of 
Ihe game, point guard D'Angelo Woodall 
caught the Raiders sleeping with a sensatiorul 
no look bullet pass down Ihe middle of the 
lane to 3 slashing Terry Collins who 
converted an easy layup. 

Hollins showed off the alhlclicism 
thai earned him a scholarship, canning four 
tade-away jump shots that IPBV simply 
could not defend. 

The play of Ihe game came as the first 
half was winding down. IPFW gained 
possession with 13 seconds to play and 
called a limeoul, Wrighl Slate, amidst their 
peril, forgot to block out center David 
Simon when Woodall lofted a jumper that 
bounced off high. Simon leapt up and 
crabbed the ball in midair, slamming home 
uie n-'bound on the way down as time eiipired. 

Woodall lalked about how the play 
energized Ihe team. 

"That was a momentum getter," 
Woodall said. "We always use steals, dunks 
or taking a charge |as motivators]," 

Everything fell apart (or the Raiders in 
the second half as the Dons went on a 22-8 
run to open the halt, channeling the energy 
from Simon's dunk into a team effort. 

Ric Wyand's sttllar defense on 
Raiders star forward Selh Dotiboa 
impressed IPFW coach Doug Noll. 

"This was Ric's finest defensive effort 
of his career here," Noll said-

Reserves see action in Mercyhurst win 



PRV coach Amie Ball wasn't 
happy wilh whal he saw on the 
court during Ihe second game of 
Fridayis match against 
Mercyhurst, 

Or maybe il was what he 
didn't sec that upsel him. 

After watching Ihe team's 
starters go cold and jusi edge 
Ihe Ukers in Game 2, Ball 
pulled four of t\is seven starlers 
to the sidelines and let some 
players who do not usually see 
much time on the courl finish 
the match. 

The back-ups made the 
most of the opportunity as they 
rallied to a victory in ihe third 
game lo lake the match 30-19, 
Si^32 and 35-33 

"It was a combination of 
both [being frustrated with the 
starlers and giving other players 
a chance lo playr This was an 
imp or I an I conference match, 
and normally 1 probably tvouldn'l 
have done that, but I thought 
our starting group went very 
flat in Came 2," Ball said. "IVe 
won Game 1. and [ talked lo 
them aboul having that killer 
instinct, but nobody talked. 
Nobody said a word. )eff |Plak| 
and Matty IZbyszcivsklJ were 
hilling bails oul of bounds. They 
needed to sit on Ihe bench and 

In the final game, the 
Mastodons were led by a starter 
in Dennis Santiago and a back- 
up in' Milch Dreisbach. 
Dreisbach. usually a vocal 
leader on the sidelines, let his 



actions do the talking in Came 3- 
"It was fun. You sit on the 
bench and you ivant to gel in, 
but there's nothing you can really 
do. 'I'ou just cheer on the team 
and that's your role." Dreisbach 
said. "When you get Ihe chance 
like this to get out on the court 
and -show yourself and do 
something, you don't want to 
make any mistakes, and 
fortunately tonight Ididn'land I 
plajteJ well." 

Santiago was the vocal 
leader on Ihe court, and he 
made il a point lo energise his 



"[Energizing Ihe other 
playersl is my job, and I've got 
to start domg that," Santiago 
said. "We had the back-iTp 
people playing. Coach ivas giving 
a chance to Ihe guys who wanted 
to play. We were a little scared 
when we slarted. We had lo get 
into it to make things happen." 

Ball was pleased with the 
altitude Santiago displayed. 

"Dennis finally did whal 
we've wanted him lo do in 
regards to Ihe leadership role," 
Ball said. "He was very good 
tonight, and now we've |usl gol 
lo build on that." 

In the final game. IPFW fell 
behind early 9-3. Kills by 
Dreisbach and Atcangel Ruiz 
Ihen pulled the Dons within Iwo 
points at 10-8. The Maslodons 
slayed within sinking distance 
until a pair of Laker errors and 
another kill by Dreisbach tied 
the score al 19-19. 

IPFW hnally got its first 
lead at 21-20 after a kill by Javier 
Garcia. Thai advantage was 



Schmidl gave the lead 
back to the Ukers at 32-21. 

The teams then traded 
points until IPFW regained the 
lead al 27-26, but again 
MercyhursI aruwered by taking 
a 29-28 lead. 

The lead changed hands 
three more limes before the 
Doi\s were able to hang on for 
Ihe victory. 

"[Assistant] coach Dennis 
Johnson came over lo us and 
said, 'I know what you guys are 
doing. You just want lo play 
longer' And I said, 'Yeah, we 
don't get this shot very often, so 
we're just playing with them 
and just want to stay in Ihe 
match,'" Dreisbach said wilh a 
smile of the match's close finish. 
"FoiLunalely, we came out with 

IPFW (b-2) was led by 
Santiago wilh 42 assists, 10 digs, 
nine aces and five kills. Ruiz 
finished wilh 15 kilts and four 
digs, while Plak had eight kills. 
Angel Ruiz-Rivera had seven 
kills and an ace, while Dreisbach 
finished wilh seven kilU. 

"I'm really happy wiHi 
those young kids, Rhyen 
[Staleyj. Milch and Mike Daiga, 
it's great for those kids to t&gt;e able 
to play," Ball said. "Obviously. 
Ihey gol off to a real slow slarl, 
but Ihey hung in there and there 
were some grcal volleys al the 
end. It's a confidence lioosler for 
those guys, il helps build our 
team's depth, and I hope this 
sends a message lo some of 
those other guys," 



Ceiling drips, Loyola slips, Dons fall 



Shortly afler ihe IPFW 
men's volleyball leam gol off lo 
a sluggish start against Loyola 
on Saturday, a leak from Ihe 
Gates Center ceiling slopped the 
malch completely for about an 

After the delay, the 
Mastodons slipped against the 
Ramblers dropping the match 
24-30, 25-30, 30-24 and 27-30. 

The Dons were able to keep

snow outside was being blown 
across an outside vent located 
directly aboVe Ihe main court in

Following several minutes

officials agreed close the bleachers 
on Ihe southwest side ol the 
arena and move Ihe malch to 

Play Ihen resumed after a 
IO-minu1e warm-up period for 
Ihe players. 

"No. [switching courts did 
not affect the match). I thought 
bolh teams handled thai very 
well," said IPFW coach Amie 
Ball. "We gol back and got 
warmed up, and obviously (Ihe 
practice court) is fine lo play on." 

Afler dropping the first two 
games, Ihe Dons got out of the 
gates quickly in the third game. 
Kills by Malt Zbyszewski and 
Jeff Plak gave IPFW a 2-0 lead 
from Ihe start. Although the 
Ramblers slayed close, the Dons 
mainlamed their two-poinl

IPFW coach Doug Noll

"ICarouthcrs] stepped up 
big in Ihe first half for us," said 
IPFW coach Noll. 

TTie Dons were beneficiaries

performance from Ric VVyand,

Noll was concerned aboul

Ihc large early rpad. 

"Somelimes it's nol good 
[to get off lo a fasi start against a 
mediocre team] because you get 
a lot of confidence and you quit 
doing the things you did to get 
Ihe lead," Noll said. 'Td much 
rather |UEl go stow and finish it off/' 

It looked like Ihe Dons 
might have an ovcrei/c load on 
their hands during warm ups 
when Ihey siied up iheir oppcBing 
centers. Chicago Stale's Clart 
Bone, a former Indiana All-Star 
from Gary Ulrth High School, 
weighed in at a solid 250 
pounds. Jason Thurman. who 
looked more like a WWE specimen 
than a basketball player, rallied 
the floorboards wilh all 350 
pounds of his 6'10" frame. 

However. Thurman ended 
up not playing due to an 



problem, and the Dons were able 
to double-team Bone most of the 
night (hanks lo the large lead. 
Senior D'Angelo Woodall 

engineering but left the door 
open lo coaching. 

"1 might stay here as a 
graduate assistant i/lhals 
possible." Woodall said. 

Noll spoke about th? 
culmination of his career as a 
Mastodon. 

"It's been fun. bul it's also 
been a struggle," Noll said. 
"We're finally coming together 
and playing well." 

Hehas no immediale plans 
to follow in his father's footsteps 
and go into coaching, though. 

"I Ihink I'm going to hang 
il (or now, and use my business 
degree lo explore a career in 
sales," Noll said. 

With the effort and 
leadership Noll and Woodall 
have shown during Ihe (raruitiun 
to Division I, fans may be sold 
on Ihem already. 



Dons fall 

From page 5 

the Dons never got the lead and 
the Ramblers won the match. 

"We were right in Ihe middle 
of game four, and we gave them 
cighl of Ihe last 10 points," Ball 
said. "It wasn't anything Ihey 
did. It was errors we made. Well, 
you can'l beat anybody like that, 
so we've gol lo work on Ihul part." 

IPFW {6-3) was led by 
Zbyszcwski wilh 21 kills, five 
digs and five blocks. Ptak also 
had 21 kills, while Ruiz-Rivera

enjoyed the game," Collins 

Sure guys, I did enjoy it, 
bul I could have enjoyed it 

II seemed like every lime 
thai Ihey went one-on-one, 
II'FW coach Doug Noll or 
Wnght Slale coach Ed Schilling 
would either change Ihe match 
or bench one of the hvo of 
them, it's like nobody else 
other than me wanted to see 
the game. 

"11 was a tot of fun {playing 
Collins 1, because we were close 
friends and we would go after 
each olher in every game [in 
high school]," KoUins said. 
'And to gel a chance lo play 
him al Ihe next level, it was 



Hollins pul forth 18 poinis 
in Ihe game wilh seven 
rebounds and was Ihe high 
scorer for Wnght State in his 
return home. You can'l fault 
Ihe guv for Irymg, though — 
he did his pari. 

But Collins, only 12 

Coints? [I's sad to see the game 
&gt;rt in the incapable hands ol 
Seth Doliboa and the lar too 
powerful hands of David 

The game itself was tolerable 
at best once il reached Ihe 
second half. The first half was 
enterlainmg. At least it was 
competitive, even if Collins 
and Hollins only matched up 
for one trip down the court. 

Once IPFW look complete 
control m the secondhalf, only 
the dream match of 
Collins/ Hollins could fulfill 
any needs of quality basketball. 
Bul, alas, wejrouldn'l even do 
that much could we? 

I read a small article m 
Saturday morning's Jouriwl 
Caulle aboul Hollins' relum to 
Fort Wayne, but Ihat was it. 
Thai was all the coverage of 
Ihis one-time area high school 
icon's big comeback. And not a 
word aboul Ihe match-up of 
Collins/Hollins Shows 



od Ihe 



illed 



s, for the 



Ihey were right, I gui 
most part, ! was wrong. 

It was much anticipated 
by rnc and I enjoyed il while it 
lasted, but il seems as if I was 
Ihe only one. "Collins/Hollins; 
The College Years" was nothing 
more than a flop. 

And honeslly, I hope I 
ne\'er have to ivatch them play 
each other again. 



IPFW final 

From page 5 

Doliboa was held to just five 
points m the second half. 

Noll came into Ihe game 
only seven points shy of 1.D0O for 
his career al IPFW. Members of 
Ihe women's volleyball leam kept 
a poster similar lo the Cal Ripken 

progress in his final game. Noll 
struggled to gel shots lo tall all 
game and Ihe accomplishment 
remained in doubt until the final 

The huge lead allowed the 
Dons to let Noll lake over Ihe 
game. He scored Ihe final six 
points, including a Ihree-poinlcr 
which bounced five feet up off Ihe 
nm and dropped in. 

The game was paused and 
Noll was presented with the game 
ball. 

The injury to .leading scorer 
Jim Kessenich may have been a 
blessing in disguise as it allowed 
Ihe younger players lo expand 
Iheir games and gain valuable 
game experience. David Simon 
displayed talent he had nol 
shown fully until Saturday's 
game m which he led all scorers 
and rebounders wilh 24 points 
and 15 boards. 

After the impressive victory. 
Noll spoke on the future of 

oil said , , 

going to come back when they see 
us play like Ihis. [Being in a con- 
ference if a deal is finalized this 
winler] will help us in the win col- 
umn because we will be playing a 
lot more teams on our level." 

IPFW will wrap up their sea- 
son at Maine on Tuesday.
