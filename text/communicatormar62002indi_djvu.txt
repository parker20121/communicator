The Music Therapy Clinic at

evening concert in Williams 
Theatre attracted a capacity 
crowd, said Linda Wright- 
Bower, director of the IPFW 
music therapy program. 

"It gives the student therapist 
an opporhinily to plan a large 
concert." Wright-Bower said of 
Ihe e\'ent. "It also gives us a 
chance to celebrate the abilities 
of the performers. At this event 
we focus on the art part of the 
therapy (the music making and 
creating), not the scienhfic end," 

One of the highlights of Ihe 
evening, she said, was a per- 
formance by a man suffering 
irom Parkinson's disease. For 
the most part, the disease has 
iL'ft him wheelchair-bound. 

At the concert, he rolled his 
wheelchair onto the stage and 
stood up at the microphone to 
^ing a love ballad he had com- 
posed for his wi/e, "There was 
not a dry eye in the theatre." 
Wright-Bower said.

related activities "to somehow 
bring about positive changes in 
behavior."

aim for his 
poetry and drarnatic works. 

Yevtushenko was bom in 
Zima in Irkutsk July 18. 1933, as 
a fourth-generation descendant 
of Ukrainians exiled to Siberia, 
He moved to Moscow in 1944. 
where he studied at the Gorky 
Inslitute of Literature from 1951 
to 1954. 



ers and poels helped breathe 
new hfe into the tradition of 
Russian lyric poetry. 

Yevtushenko published his 
first book of poetry in 1952. 
After publishing Ihe book, he 
became the most popular 
spokesman for a growing new 
generation of poets who 
rebelled against the old tradi- 
tions of social realism in 
Russian writing. 

He gained intematlonal fame 
in 1961 with his poem "Babi 
Yar," in which he denounced 
Nazi and Russian anti-Senutism. 

The poem's title refers to a 
Ukrainian ravine where Nazi 
soldiers slaughter«i 95,000 Jews 
during the German occupation. 

The poem was not published 
in Russia until 19S4. although it 
was frequently recited both in 
Russia and abroad. 

Yevtushenko's demands for 
greater artistic freedom and his 
attacks on Stalinism and 
bureaucracy in the late 1950s 
and 1960s made him a leader of 
Soviet youth. 



He was allowed to travel 
widely in the West until 1963, 
when he published "A 
Precocious Autobiography." 

His privileges and favors 
were withdrawn, but restored 
two years later. In 1972. 
Yevtushenko gained huge suc- 
cess with his play "Under the 
Skin of the Statue of Liberty," 

Since the 1970s he has been 
active in many fields of culture, 
writing novels, engaging in act- 
ing, film directing, photogra- 
phy and public awareness of 
those repressed by Stalin. He 
has also remained politically 
outspoken and in 1974 support- 
ed Solzhenitsyn when the 
Nobel Prize winner was arrest- 
ed and exiled. 

In 1989 Yevtushenko t&gt;ccame 
a member of the Congress of 
People's Deputies. iTe was 
appointed honorary member of 
the American Academy of Arts 
and Sciences in 1987.

"Jcderson's Children; The 
Slory al One American Family" 
by Shiinnon LanLer and Jane 
Fetdman is the slory of a fami- 
ly's qucsl for unify. 

Descendants of Thomas 
Jefferson, both &lt;ha$c from 
Maft-lha IVayk'S Jefferson and 
Sally Hemings, talk aboul the 
rcrcnl DNA Icsls which hnk 
Jefferson lo Hemings' children 
and the impact Ihal thi$ discov- 
ery has had upon Ihcir lives. 

ITacism is a key focus of the 
book. Many of those interviewed 
tall about how it has or has not 



played a key pan in their Live?. 

especially hard for those 
Descendants whose family 
passed inlo the while world 
generations ago. Tliey had never 
felt the stigma of l&gt;elne uruc- 
cepled because of Iheir heritage 
before Ihcy went lo the family 
reunion and faced boslilily from 
certain members of the legiti- 
mate Jefferson Descendants. 

Many of the family mem- 
bers have been independently 
researching their own heritage 
in order to better understand 
where Ihey come from. DNA 
findings have helped lo link 



other 

imilar research. This has helped 
some lo understand their histo- 
ry, while it has caused others 

Knowing one's herilaee is 
impoitani for many people Id 
understand who Ihey are. 

Instead of finding answers 
as he travels around the country 
meeting his newfound relatives. 
Lanier raises many new ques- 
tions. Did Hemings and 
Jefferson love each other? What 
are the implications of this on 
Jefferson as a historical figure? 
IVhat does Ihe family do now? 



While ihe lamily members 
are still trymg to worli through 
(heir confusion, a dialogue has

Families should keep communication open 



WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind, 
(PU News) - Talking lo your 
children is the most important 
way lo help them deal with 
changes going on during lough 
economic times, says a Purdue 
University eipcrl on child 
development. 

"(Children may not under- 
stand Ihe details, but they sec 
■ their parents' stress," says 
Extension Specialist Judy Myers- 
Vtiib. If parents don'l talk, chil- 
dren can imagine the worst. 
When parents don't bring up the 
subiecl, children think whatever 
is causing Ihe stress is taboo or 
inappropriate lo talk about, 

"Change causes siress. The 
amount of stress depends, in 
pari, on how much ol a change 



happens," Myers-Walls says. 
The larger the difference 
between what is expected and 
what actually happens increases 
Ihe amount of siress. 

Sudden layoffs can be par- 
ticularly upsetting, "If you had 
been on an upswing, it's more of 
a shock when Ihe rug gets 
pulled out," she says. 

Before parents talk lo their 
kids, Myers-Walls says they 
should assess the situation and 
develop objectives. 

Parents should think about 
the reasons for the changes at 
home and how much they want 
to tell their chil^n about the 
family's finances. 

'■tA 



by saying, This is a 
chance to try something new — 
it's time for a change anyway,'" 
she says. 

Myers-Walts says the inten- 
sity of parent-chile^ reiationships 
sometimes makes it difficult to 
talk about painful situations. 
One of Ihe most important 
thincs lo tell children, she says, 
is what is going to change and 
what isn't going to change.

thing that may change is that 
they will have to take their

Curtain Call

"Wc Wt't't' Soldiers" sure 
to h- remembered as one 
of the great war movies of 
all time. 

Randall Wallace has both 
wiillen and directed the best 
war movie since "A Bridge Too 
Far," directed by Richard 
Allenboiough. 

The film tells the story of 
the United Stales 7th Cavalr)' 
being one of the first handfuls of 
Unilcd States troops lo enter the 
Vietnam Conflict in 1965 after 
then-President Ljndon Johrison 
informed the nation that the 
United Slates was getting 

Mel Gibson plan's Lieutenant 
Colonel Hal Mooic, command- 
ing roughly JSO men of the 7th. 
Moore and his bunch ol helicop- 
ter horsenien are deployed lo 
Vietnam and eventually find 
themselves on a mission to 
locate and destroy an enemy 



That's 



unknown slrength, 
;re Gibson and his 
sly Sergeant Major, 
played by Sam Elliott, come into 
play. Some of the sergeant's 
more memorable quotes would 
not be suitable for print; howev- 
er, that may be why Moore isn't 
going lo suffer the same fate as 
the blond haired legend of Little 
Dig Horn. 

The mission takes Moore to 
the la Drang Valley where he 
finds Ihe enemy and more than 
he expected. 

The movie doesn't lei on lo 



Moore's command suffered 
200 dead out of the 450, 

Staying true with the all- 
imporlant graphic violence that 
provides the realism to show- 
people what combat is like. 
there are plenty of corpses, 
splattering blood. head 
wounds, chest wounds and 



Napalm burned skin falling oil 

Gibson onte again comes lo 
the screen playing the all-around 
'good-guy character he is so well 
knoivn tor, Tlie believability is 
great and it is the character who 
Li so full of kindness; love for his 
children, his men and his coun- 



Ellioll doesn't have a 
miiuslache in this film, but he 
does have the same brassy 
gung-ho attitude usually seen in 
the roles he plays. Just lo give 
you an idea, Ellioll doesn't lake 
an M-16 into combat with him, 
only his 45 sidearm. When asked, 
he replies something along the 
lines ol; "Don'l worry, when it 
comes lime to pick up a rifle, 
there'll be plenty layin' on ttie 
ground." He abo tells a group 
of olficers that if they ever call 
him grandpa, he'll kill them. 

In one of my favorite parts. 
Elliott points out lo journalist 
Joseph Galloway, (vho helped 
author the book Ihe movie is 
based on, who found his way lo 
Moore's la Prangballle 7onc that 
there is no such thing as a non- 
combatant in a combat zone. 

"We Were Soldiers" is 
going to be one of the best films 
seen in Ihealres and living 
rooms this year. The film's real- 
ism, character development, 
cinematography, excellent and 
mililarily-accuratc dialogue and 
movement will make lor a 
strong lead at the Oscars

Breast cancer screening important to prevention 



Breast cancer is the second 
leading cause of cancer-related 
deaths in women, falling just 
behind lung cancer. 

In the United States, 
192,200 women wUt be diag- 
nosed with breast cancer in 2001 
and aboul 40,600 of those diag- 
nosed will die from the disease. 

According lo the American 
Cancer Society, there has been a 
Jwline in breast cancer dealh 
r,ii&gt;- irom 1992 to 1996 due to 
o.irlur detection and improved 
InMliiienl. Breast canter has a 
high cun; rale if diagnosed early. 

The most reliable way lo 
detect breast cancer is by perform- 
ing a monlhly brcasi sell-cjam. 

Another method ol breast 
cancer deleclion is an x-ray of 
the breast called a mammogra- 
phy This examination lakes 
aboul 2D minute. Mammograms 
cannot prevent breast canter 
from happening, but Ihey can 
delect it in early stages. 
Theivlore. they are Tnown as 



screening measures. Mammograms 
cannol-piDve that an abnormal 
area found within the breast is 
cancerous, but a biopsy could be 
done to find that out. 

The procedure can be tem- 
porarily uncomfortable because 
Ihe breast has lo be compnssed 
lo flatten and spread the tissue 
in order to produce a good 
mammogram. It is recommend- 
ed that a woman should not have 
a mammogram done just before 
or during the menstrual period 
lo help lessen the discomfort, 

'The amount of radiation 
used to perform the mammogra- 
phy is not considered a health 
hazard unless the woman is 
pregnant. A woman should nol 
undergo mammography i{ she is 
pregnant due to low dose ol 
radiation that could be harmful 
10 Ihe fetus. However, if a mam- 
mogram must be performed 
dunng pregnancy, the woman's 
abdomen should be covered 
with a ptotcclive lead shield. 

The cost of mammograms 
or a percentage of thai cost is 
covered by Medicare. Medicaid 



and most private health plans. 
Low-cost mammograms are 
available in most communities. 

Research published in the 
'Annals of Internal Medicine" 
has shown that mammography 
use is lower for African- 
American ts'omen than for white 
women in Ihe same age group, 
at each income level and in each 
slate. Having a regular health 
care provider is an important 
factor, but this vas lound 



^uffiai 



the 



liae 

lotconomic and regional dif- 
ferences in mammography use. 
African- Americans also 
have decreased five-year sur- 
vival rate from breast cancer, 
possibly due to the less frequent 
use of mammograms. 

The American Cancer 
Society recommends an initial 
scieerung mammogram a I age 
40 and annually thereafter. 
Women with a family history of 
breast cancer are at a higher risk 
than those with no significant 
family history. 



Parents also should assure 
childrcn that the family will slav 
together. 

The decision of how money 
should be used is different 
depending on the age ol Ihe chil- 
dren, Myers-Walls says. Older 
kids may be given choices, such 
as a cut in allowance or no cable 
Iclevision. "This helps older 
children feel they have more 
control," she says. 

Students in lale elementary 
school may be more concerned 
about having certain items so 
they still fcellikc they Ht in with 
other children- Explainmg why 
these changes arc necessary can 
help chiFdrcn accept the 
changes, Myers-Walls says.

Concert pianist Alex Chien inspires audience at free recital 



By Becky Shiuirr, SUff Wriler 

This pul Sunday jfler- 
noon. 1 braved Ihc clemcnls in 
favor of 3 chance to lioak up a Itl- 
Ife cuMurc I allended a tecilal 
pcilotmed by world celebrated 
concert pianul. Alnr Chien. 

This performance was (ree 
to the public, although dona- 
lions were welcome and apprc- 
dated Ihruu^ a passing ol the 
oflrnng plate at the First 
Presbyterian Church on IVesI 
Wayne Street here in Fori Wayne, 
whure Ihc redul took place, 

Chlen's flawless pcr/orm- 
ance was a Joy lo Ihc senses. 
Soothing anJ landlul, his first 
piece allowed one's mind to 
wander, .ind wander mine did. 



As he performed "Fantasy 
in C Major- by Robert Schuman. 
I found my mind playing pic- 
tures of rippling water and play- 
ful creatures flitting about leas- 
ing each other. Isn't that what a 
truly talented pianist should do? 
Send each of his listeners into 
fanlasyland lo pursue the 
images presented by his work? 
The audience members were 
enthralled by the performance. 

When he performed his sec- 
ond piece, one by Alexander 
Zinlinksky, titled 'Country 
Dancers," I was taken away yet 
again. Sweet and energetic, I 
could picture country maids 
running and dancing in happi- 
ness and (oy al just being alive. 
Each piece that Chicn 



played was equally delighllul. 
After a short intermission, he 
came back lo deliver another 
stunning performance to a 
grateful audience. 

He romanced* us with slow 
lender notes, almost telling us a 
story with his beautiful choices. 
After a well-deserved standing 
ovation and a liltle coa.ung, 
Chien prwenled the audience 
with two more beautiful selec- 
tions before leaving the stage. 

Chien is one of the first 
Chinese- Americans invited lo 
the People's Republic ol China 
(or a concert tour including such 
cities as Beijing, Shanghi and 
Canlon. 

He holds a Bachelor's. 
Master's and Doctoral of Music 



decree from the world famous 
Juilliard School o( Music. Chien 
has performed in countries on 
five coWincnls. including Australia, 
Austria. China. Greece. Hong 
Kong, New Zealand, Poland. 
Spain, Taiwan and the Urulcd 
Slates of America. 

Currently a resident of 
Meadville. Penn. where he is 
FirsI Presbyterian's director of 
music, Stephen Shelti told me 
that he was lucky enough to 
have worked with Chien previ- 
ously and was proud (o call him 
a friend and mentor. 

This enjoyable musical 
recital is part of the First 
Presbyterian Church's "Music 
Series Spring 2002." This is Ihc 
■Mlh year the church has been 



able lo bruig this type ol musical 
talent to Fort \Vij'ne tesidents.

Rusted Root creates example of neo-folk 



By Jonah Crismore, Features Editor 

The nature of rock music is one that is evolu- 
tionary. Ollcn past musical traditions mend with 
modern technological .idvances, creating a grad- 
ual change that is passed from one generation of 
musicians to the next. Pittsburgh's Rusted Root is 
the epitome of this concept. ' 

Rusted Root is due lo release their fourth 
album, "Welcome to My Party" April 9. II com- 
bines the band's folk influence with a edgy sound 
that can only be composed with modem record- 
ing equipment. 

The band believes the song to be like an 
organism, having its own history and a different 
meaning for diffcienl people, said vocalist Michael 
GlabickLTTie hislory of Rusted Root is much like 
Glabicki's comparison. 

Rusted Root evolved fnjm Ihc single entity of 
Clabicki lo the progressive scKtet it is now, 'Fliey 
have attracted a strong following that understands 
thai along with Iheir evolution, the band is creat- 
ing a revolution. 

Songwriting is the essence of the band. 
Clabicki said that he realized at an early stage of 
the Rusted Roofs development, the band must be 
.1 band that is capable of making songs. 

"For me, it really comes doivn lo the songs. At 
Ihta stage in the game. I knew some faults we had 
in the past. II was conscious decision lo make sure 
the songs were kept in the forefront and that the 
band could still do whal they do in and around 
those songs at the right moment," Clabicki ; 



"Wclco 



imlL'i'l^'l', 



ceptio 



othis 



rule. II is an album that is a celebration aboul cele 
brations. While eacli song has excelleni lyrics, a 
tradenuirkof Rusted Root,-Ihe band was not afraid 
lo experiment, 

A track like "People ol My Village" showcas- 
es drummer Jim Donovan's computet skills. The 
techno beat is both enchanting and hypnotizing, 
engaging the listener into that one song, but also 
creating a sense of intrigue to hear the rest of the 



One trail about Rusted Root that 
Clabicki is very proud of is their different 
method of production. 

Producer Bill Botlrell, who is known 
for his production skills with such acts as 
Tom Petty and Shcryl Crow, had lo spend a 
four-month pre-production period where 
he could observe and learn how Rusted 
Root makes an album, and how Ihey make 
an album great. 

"Welcome to My Parly" is a dazzlmg 
display of how a band can use a year off lo 
rccuperale from traveling and touring and 
then go right back into the sludio lo cit.iif 
something wholly original. 

"We^ reached a point in ourcr.'jln ilv 
whore it was jusl time lo cxamim- olhrr 
musical avenues," Clabicki said ol KusiuJ 
Root's time away from recording, adding 
thalitwasdifferentand scary at first, but lie 
now recognizes it as intriguing. 

Renewal is the word that describes 
Rusted Root's new tone in "Welcome to My 
Party." Energy seeps through the album 
with an electronic beal and more traditional 
inslrumcnls, 

White Rusled Root maintains its inno- 
vative attitude, thev have also managed to 
maintain many ol tne folk aspects that have 
made them so we! I -received. 

Their evolution has made Ihcm into 
something completely new and completely 
different from other folk acts performing 
today They have kept all the values of their 
rock predecessors, but now have also found 
a new sound that will inspire musical acts 
for generations to come, 

Theirnoiv album is a primeexample of 
what can be accomplished when talented 
musicians respect where they have come 
from, and foresee where Ihev can go.

Fry now, pay later: a skin cancer overview 



By Joan Wickham, RN, Guest Writer 

Skin cancer is an abnormal cell growth 
in a skin blemish or mole. There are three 
types of skin cancer: basal cell, squamous 
cell and melanoma, which is malignant or 
deadly cancer. Melanoma, which is on the 

form of cancer, claimmg more young adults 
than any other cancer. 

However, all three are very curable if 
detected in time, according to Ian M. Smilh. 
MD, of Ihc University of Iowa. Smith coined 
the plirasp "Fry now, pay later" because Ihc 
greatest incidence of skin cancer is related to 
early sun exposure, particularly bums with 
blisters in childhood and teen years. 

Janice Harris, MSN, with mpalient der- 
matology at Washington Hospilal Center, 
reports people have received Ihe majority of 
their sun exposure before age 21. Harris fur- 
ther stales that development ol skin cancer 
comes a lew* years after exposure with 50 
percent occurring before age 55, 

Jonathon T. Wolfe, MD, wilh the 
Univetsily of Pennsylvania Hospital, stales 
changes in fashion, less ozone protection 
and longer life span aie all contributing 
causes to non-melanoma skin cancers. 



The besi defense againsi skin t 
to avoid sun exposure during high i 
lime from II a,m.-2 p.m. ■ 

Experts also advocate 
According to a study by Howard K, Koh, 
MD, ol Boston University, only 25 percent of 
sun tanners use sunscreen wilh a solar pro- 
tection ol 15 or higher. 

Wolfe warns of the danger in using tan- 
ning beds because ivith over-exposure, Ihe 
chance of developmg skin cancer increases, 
just as wilh sun exposure. 

Caution must be used when using tan- 
ning beds, so follow directions and read the 
warning labels. Authorities recommend 
skin scn^ning as the best way to slop the 
alarming increase in mortality fnjm skin cancer. 

Wolfe thinks primary care physicians 
offer the best link in reducing skin cancer 
The primary care provider needs lo do skin 



vital for any suspi- 
cious skin blemish. 

A study by Alan Geller, RN, of Boston 
University showed l&gt;ial early deteclion 
reduces mortality. 

Celler's study showed higher death 
rates from melanoma in lower income pop- 
ulations. This population was unable or did 
nut realize the importance of seeking earlier 
medical care. 

■ Harris uses the ADCD's of identifying 
suspicious blemishes:

• D — diameter The diai

Self-skin assessment also is a primary 
detection measure. Look for changes in skin 
blemishes or motes. Smith notes the com- 
mon sites of melanoma for men arc on Ihe 
trunk and on the legs for women. 



Remember, only you can prevent sun- 
bum and over-exposure in tanning beds. 

Skin cancer is very preventable and 
curable if discovered early. If any changes 
are found on your skin, seek prompt med- 
ical attention.

Right now Ihe Indiana Pacers are on a dcli- 
cale bubble for making the NBA playof/s. They are 
tied with Ihe Charlolle Hornets lor the eighth 
playoff spot in Ihe Eastern Conference. I call il a 
delicate bubble because they have been teetering 
around 500 all season, showing progress and hit- 
ting slumps along the way. 

Team owner Donnie Walsh and Ihe resl of Ihe 
Pacers management recenlly closed a block-buster 
Irade with Ihe Chicago Bolls, Due to a question- 
able working relationship with Walsh. Ihe Pacers' 
lcadingscorer,Jalen Rose, was traded to Chicago. 

Talented point guard Ttavis Best and a sec- 
ond round draft pick were also handed over lo the 
Bulls. Indiana acquired a quarlel of young talent 
consisting ol Ron Mercer, Ron Arlest. Brad Miller 
and Kevin Ollie. 

Mercer and Arlest bring in athlelicism and a 
serious perimeter threat lo Ihe Pacer offense. 
Miller is a hard-nosed center who can now free up 
Jermaine O'Neal to move lo power-fonvard posi- 
tion, OQie will back up starting rookie poinl guard 
Jamal Tirisley. Ollie also brines playolf experience. 

These new faces will onTj' add to Ihe already 
young team al Indiana. They are now the 
youngest team in the league. The .Pacers have 
three pbycrs drafted straight oul of'high school: 
Jonalhon Bender, Al Harrington and O'Neal. And 
these kids aren't bench-warmers, either. 



espor«ibilily of 



I l.irringion and Bender have seci 
ing lime, and now bear Ihe 
adding lo Ihe offense, 

O'Neal may eventually be Ihe grcalest center 
to come into the league since another O'Neal 
stepped on Ihe NBA hardwood. He is quickly 
establishing himself in the paint, and was named 
an Eastern CorJerence All-Star lor Ihe first lime 
this year. He can now move to the power fonvard 
position as Miller takes over Ihe center role. The 
power-forward position is O'Neal's natural place 
on Ihe court and it will free him up to help Ihe 
weak side and block shots on Ihe deferuive end. 

Since Ihe trade, ihe Pacers have been 3-3, hul 
perhaps Ihe best news comesout of an impressive 
road viclory over the league's best team. Ihe 
Sacramento Kings. O'Neal led Indiana in scoring, 
who had lo play wilhout their scrappy leader. 
Reggie Miller. Miller was suspcndec lor two 
games after a fight wilh the Lakers' Kobe Bryant. 

If the Pacers can adjusi lo this trade quickly, 
they can move ahead over other teams in the East 
who arc looking lo slay in the playoff mix. 
Charlolle and Toronto have had recent problems 
with finding the W, 

Look ^r Ihe Indiana Pacers to mature as a 
whole and learn quickly, wilh coach Isaiah 
Thomas giving the lessons.

Rare finding of lU's official flower at university nature preserve

lU biology professor Keith 
"Clay, dircclor of the new pre-

said. "Students also learn how

from harvesting in many stales." 
He said the trailing arbutus, also 
known as the mayflower. is the 
state flower for Massachusetts 
and the provincial flower of 
Nova Scotia. 

The flower has a prominent 
role in lU history In addition to 
its designation as the official

health facilities. 

Although the use of music as 
a form of healing has been 
around since people first started 
making music, the practice did- 
n't become a recogruzed profes- 
sion until 1950. 

The Music Therapy Program 
has been al IPFW since 1975 and 
the clinic opened when the 
Classroom Medical Building 
was built. Wright-Bower became 
director of Ihe program in 1987. 

In recent years, demand for 
the services provided by the 
Music Therapy Clinic has 
grown, Wright-Bower said. 

The growth has stirred inter- 
est within Ihe School of Visual 
and Performing Arls lo design 
an outpatient en tension office of 
Ihe clinic, she said. The exten- 
sion' facility will accommodate 
,thc patients who are not accept* 
ed into IPFW's free therapy program. 

'There will be some charges 



for the President's Medal and 
other lU imagery. Bloomington 
has an Arbutus Drive and an 
Arbutus Baptist Church. 

To help save Ihe trailing arbu- 
tus. Ihe preserve has established 
Ihe Arbutus Conservation Fund, 
Botanist Mike Homoya of the 
Indiana Department of Natural 
Resources said the plant is occa- 
sionally found in far northern 
Indiana and Illinois, plus eastern 
Kentucky and eastern Ohio. 

In the lower Midwest, trailing 
arbulus occurs onlv in Monroe 
County and parts of a few neigh- 
boring counties. Homoya said 
the species appears to be at the 

associated wilh the outpatient 
clinic, but we hope lo obtain 
foundation and private funding 
lo that fees can be offered 
sliding scale." 

Some families will need 
scholarships. Currently, tht 
Music Therapy Clinic is spon- 
soring a used CD drive to collect 
music for use in music Iherapy 

The Clinic is asking for dona- 
tions of gently used CDs~

Creek with no other populations

Clay said Ihe plant has 
become isolated from others fur- 
ther east because of the creation 
of Lake Monroe in Ihe 1960s, The 
plant rarely produces fruit, and 
Its seeds are dispersed by ants. 

Clay said the only location of 
the trailing arbutus on the entire 
lU campus is the Moore's Creek

another site near Criffy Woods
