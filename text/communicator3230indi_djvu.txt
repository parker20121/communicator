Oitr the psji few &gt;-cais we've

vice chancellor of financial aJIai^s, 

"Wc did a sLudeni survey lasl 
tall nnd ibe retulu of ihai survey 
came out positive. We believe the 
demand it there to suppon them, so 
ui: decided 10 put the projecl logeih- 



ei." be said. 

TIk apanmcnLs. will be built 
cast of campus, just KrosiCrcscenl 
Avenue. TTie plan was to have sev- 
eral buildings with a mixture of sin- 
gle, two- and foui-bcdroom apan- 
menis, -The consultants' repon that 
wis based on the student survey 
concluded we could suppon 1700 to 
1800 beds. Their iniiii^ rsronunen- 
daiiDn, though, u'as lo sLin with a 
project of 500 beds, juJI to be con- 
servative and ID make sure it 
worked." Branson said. 

"Our initial thinking at this 
point is that cacb apanmenl will 
have kitchen, bathroom and proba- 
bly a wasbcr and dryei. We would

-We V 



xm for telephone and

ITic apaiunents will also bave 
n^ideni assistants "id maintain dis- 
cipline and ID make sure students 
gel the rigbi kind of experience 
there," Branson said. 

"We certainly see three good 
opponunities ftx students we'll try 



"The campus is growing in tra- 
ditional age full-time students," 
Dranson said, "and I would guess 
that's where the majority of Ihc slu- 
denu will come from." 

IPFW will lease die property 
on which U»c apanmenLs will be 
built to a private developer. Students 
wht) live in Itic apartments will pay 
rent 10 this devclopci. 



"I've had lots of questions as 
10 what Ihis will do lo our student 
fees," Branson said, "but it doesn'l 
nffeci dicmaiall. It'll be a self-sup- 
porting operation."

Pholo by 
Linda Leslie, Sports Editor 

The roundabout was built five years ago 
when IPFW administrators, along with orebiiecU 
and road designers, were looking for a solution 
to ticavy irafFic. 

"We had a real uaJfic botdeneck here. Cars 
would back up clear out 10 Crescent and up into 
the turn lanes. The designers suggested we look 



al a roundabout because diey move iraffic very 
quickly." said Walt Branson, vice chancellor of 
Financial Alfaiis, "So we decided 10 go ahead 
and. as a pan of the second parking garage pioj- 
ccl. put in die roundabout." 

In addition to Ihe roundabout. Uie campus 
toads have a little history behind them as well. 
All die road names that aie colors are named for 
die Purdue and Indiana IJniveisily colors. The 
road names that indicate directions were origi&gt; 
nally named for the direction they went when the 
university was first buili, and only had four 
roads around Kcldcr,

the dancers work all year long at 
games, but they also work Tor their 
supplies. Hopkins said the dance 
team was only allotted S!00 in 

enough (o pay for shoes, said 
Hopkins All Ibe other supplies 
came from fundraisers put on by Ibe 
dancers. 

After (wo years of coaching at 
IPFW, one of Ihe reasons Hopkins 
IcCi is because she feels there is a 
lack of growth and lack of funds. 
According in Hopkins, schools such 
as Ohio State artd Indiana University 
don'( have id pay for most of their 

dnnccn receive some type of bencni 
such as a seholaiship or college 
credit. Hopkins made a request for a 
benefit for the dancers. Her request 
was denied and she believes 11 was 
an adminisirativc decision. Hopkins 
also thinks i( is possible ihat money

IPFW did not have a cheeileading

Bowman and Hopkins, the former 
coach left IPFW's squad sii weeks 
before die season was over. 
Uniforms were missing and there 
was no money 'o purchase ncn 
materials, said Bowman. As a result, 
(he position was not posted. 
Bowman s^d (hat dicre are at leui 
four women who have shown inter- 
est in combining dancing and cheer- 
ing and at least two current Silver 

panicipaling. 

However, Mayes and Hopkins 
disagree with this idea. They both 
agree that dancing and cheering are 
two very different concepts. 
Hopkins said cheering and dancing 
were combined before in IWS, 

"There are two different (ypcj 
of people, widi two different types 
of talents," said Hopkins 
Cheerleaders can cheer, but ihty

A wise man once said. "The 
only Ihing that is constant is 
change." IPFW Athleiic Director 
Walter Bowman would like to 
change his department's NCAA 
classification from Division It to 
Division 1. Perhaps this is just a 
fruitless endeavor on Bowman's 

Even though die IPFW faculty 
scnale approved a re.solulion for die 
school to develop a plan for n move 

Hondei if die city of Fon Wayne can 
support a Division 1 program. 
Accord liig lo "The Sponing News," 
Fort Wayne ranked 2fiS in the maga- 
7Jne's poll of the nation's best sports 

Many question if IPFW is fis- 
cally ready for such a move. It is 
c:( pensive lo participate at Ihe 
Division I level, according to die 
NCAA's Revenue and Eipenscs 
Report. Tbe average total revenue 
for a Division l-A school is 
515,483,000. The average total 
eipenseisSl4,336,000. Schools dial 
have football are classified as Div. I- 
A or 1-AA, I-A football schools are 
usually fairly elaborate programs, 
such as Nobc Dame. Division I'AA 
schools' average loial revenue is 
54,012,000 and the expense is 
S4,J8l.0O0. a 5469,000 loss. A

why . 



money is necessary for a Division 1 
program is the number of sports a 
school must have and the number of 
scholanhips avaibble for die slu&lt; 
deol -athletes. According to the 
NCAA, 'Division I member institu- 
tions have to sponsor a( lcas( seven 
sports (or men and seven for women 
|or sn for men and eight for women) 



seven female teams 
fsoftball. cross- 
country, track, bas- 
ketball, soccer, ten- 
nis and volleyball). 

Division 1 program 
is mandated lo have 
13 scholarships 
available for the 
men's baskclball 
program. IPFW has 
five scholarships 
available (or its 
men's basketball program 

This is because Division II 
docs not have the same requirements 
as Division I in number of scholar- 
ships avaitabte. 

However, one might also won- 
der if IPFW should become a 
Division I panicipanl since there 
might be harmful lamincations to 
IPFW's main a i traction, men's vol-

Steven C. Beering, 

"All major policy decisions 
must go diTOugh me. It is my deci-

Beering said. 

Because Purdue is IPFWs fis- 
cal agent, Wartell must forward his 
decision to die Purdue president. 
Then tbe Purdue president will 
decide whcdiaor nol a letter will be 
written lo the NCAA, informing the 
organization dial the school intends 
to upgrade. 

Because Beering 's (enure is 
complete and his predecessor has nol 
yet been chosen, it might be wise to 
wait befon; applying for Division I.
