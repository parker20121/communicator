Conference televised by satellite 



By JULIE MAGSAMEN 
Staff Writer 

Indiana University-Purdue 
Unii'ersity will t&gt;e the site for a 
nationwide live, interactive video 
conference for AIDS on April 3, 1986, in 
the CI ass room- Medical Building, 
Titled Separating Fact From Fiction, 
this community service program will 
provide detailed and up-to-date in- 
formation concerning Ihe subject of 
AIDS as a national concern. 

Sponsored by Lutheran, Parkview 
Memorial, and St. Joseph's Hospitals, 
in cooperation with Indiana Univer- 
sity-Purdue University, the program 
will be broadcast from the University 
of Massachusetts through NUTN 
I National Universities Television 
Network) and picked up by IPFW's 
satellite dish. 

The Center for Disease Control 
predicts between t4,ooo and 15,000 new 
eases of AIDS for 19B6, and the 
American Hospital Association reports 
that the disease has now spread to all 
50 states. Believing that campuses and 
universities have an obhgation to 
provide their students with the best, 
most current information about AIDS, 
this conference hopes to dispel some 
common myths and misconceptions 
many people have ' Nationally 
recognized experts from leading 
universities, institutes, and medical 
schools in Boston as well as other 
experts from across the country will 
discuss topics ranging from the very 
nature of the disease to precautions 
and the rights of the AIDS sufferer. 

The program is broken into tour 
segments. The first deals with AIDS as 
a public health phenomenon and 
discusses the symptoms, treatment, 
and myths concerning the disease. The 
second s^ment breaks down the 
different AIDS groups, and the in- 




cidence, distribution, and control of 
the disease. The third segment shows 
what progress has been made in 
research and prevention of AIDS. The 
final segment deals with the social, 
political, and legal implications 
caused by AIDS, 

Wade Frederick, director of Con- 
tinuing Education Services, believes 
that AIDS is a social phenomenon. 
"There are al! sorts of social, medical, 
and legal implications with this 
disease. People without any source of 
rehable information have nlany 
misconceptions and myths about the 
problem. This program is not just for 
students or faculty, but for all of the 
general public. This is a free public 
service and an opportunity tor con- 
cerned people to find out the latest 
information and facts concerning 
AIDS." 

Roger Ball, public relations director 
of Parkview Memorial Hospital, gave 
views as to why Parkview helped to 
underwTite some of the cost for the 
program. "We feel it is good for the 
public to get all of the information 
possible concerning AIDS. This 
nationally televised conference 



seemed the best way to do it. We have 
had patients with AIDS and this caused 
a great deal of internal concern with 
our staff and other patients. 'Will [ get 
"it" from breathing the same air, 
shaking hands, being in the same 
room, or drinking water from the same 
fountain as an AIDS victim' were very 
real fears that our people faced. After 
being presented with all the correct 
facts and procedures in dealing with 
Uie disease, everyone was able lo go 
about their business with more con- 
fidence. People who really care and 
are concerned about knowing about 
AIDS wilt be at the conference. " 

"We are very pleased to be a co- 
sponsor to this program," slated 
Ann Colone, director of public 
relations for St Joseph's Hospital. 
"We l)elieve that this conference will 
impart some valuable information that 
was not available to people before. 
Information that will be the latest and 
most updated on the subject. The open 
discussion will make many people 
aware of the problems that concern 
all, I hope those interested will be able 
to come and participate." 

Among the prestigious panel will be 



George Grady, MD, Chief 
Epidemiologist, Commonwealth of 

Massachusetts; and Roberl Schooley, 
M,D,, Infectious Disease Unit. 
Massachusetts General Hospilal. 
Those participating are encouraged to 
call in questions throughout the 
program. Whenever possible, they will 
be addressed during the first three 
segments of the program. To 
strengthen the interaction between the 
panelists and listeners, they have 
scheduled a twenty-minute question 
and answer session following the third 
segment of the conference. 

"The seating capacity is based on a 
'first come, first served" basis" stated 
Frederick. "This will be our first 
major program being broadcast from 
our satellite dish on campus. Ken 
Balthaser, of the Learning Resource 
Center, will be handling all of the 
technicalities of this Without the 
hospitals backing us, it would not have 
been feasible for us to bring this ser- 
vice to the public. I am confident that 
the success of this program will bring 
many more similar programs of 
public high interest to our university, I 
believe that everytwdy will benefit 
from this experience and gain 
knowledge that they might never have 
had the opportunity to elsewhere. " 

Although there will not be a panel on 
campus, those involved are working on 
preparing a list or will let people know 
who lo contact tor more information 
regarding any subject concerning 
AIDS, The national AIDS forum hopes 
to develop enough interest on cam- 
puses that the universities will initiate 
policies and procedures for dealing 
with AIDS and its implications, 

"We have seating for 390 people, but 
if.only 39 people show up and benefit 
from this conference, it will be a 
success." stated Frederick, 



Center encourages understanding of world 

IPFW Global Studies ^^^~~^ 



promotes interaction 

By RALPH HAINES 
Staff Writer 

"The United States is not an island in itself," according to Dr. Evangelos ( Vant 
Coufoudakis, professor of political science at IPFW and director of Indiana 
University's Center for Global Studies "We need lo understand what is happening 
in the world around us because what we do affects world out there, and what they 
do affects us." 

According to Coufoudakis, Americans, perhaps more than most other people, 
refusetolookbeyond their borders— refuse to recognize the necessity of polibcal, 
social and economic interaction between all nations as the planet moves into the 
twenty-first century. Indiana University's Center for Global Studies, headquar- 
tered in Fort Wayne, in cooperation with similar organizations on campuses 
throughout theUnitedStateslandwiththeencouragementof the U.S. Department 
of Education), to promote the understanding of the relationship of America with 
the outside world. The Center works in two ways to achieve that goal: one, through 
the university ; and two, outreach into the community. 

The Center is represented on all eight campuses of Indiana University. Its ac- 
tivities are primarily concerned with providing assistance in curriculum 
development or "internationalizing the curriculum." While the social sciences 
offer some courses with international flavor le.g., international relations courses 
in political science, cross-cultural courses in sociology and history, etc), the 
outside world is quite often forgotten in courses in the business, education and 
technical fields The Center assists the faculty in a variety of disciplines I including 
llie social sciences! in giving international dimensions to the curriculum by 
helping to update present courses or by assisting with the introduction of new 
courses. Dr. Coufoudakis points out, "People quiteoftenneedan extra push, in the 
form of development grants, etc., togiveanincenfive to update." 

The Center for Global Studies conducts conferences throughout the state on 
topics of international concern in order lo bring the community and university 
together. These conferences may last a whole day or be only one speaker as part of 
a series. These conferences are funded by the Center with some assistance from 
interested community gfoups. Charges for individual participation are minimal — 
usually only enough to cover the cost of luncheon during a day-long conference. 
Notices are posted for conferences to be held, and the faculty and students at 
IPFW are encouraged to attend. 

Certain community groups are targeted for conferences due to their particular 
mterests. An example is a recent conference at lU-East in Richmond where the 




iCeiil 



ofesscir of polilit jl siinict- al IPFW and the 
■r for Global Sluctics i pholo by :\lark New). 



Chamber of Commerce joined with Ihe Center, in conference, on the relationship of 
southeast Indiana economy to Ihe rest of the world. Other conference subjects 
have included arms control, military spending and Soviet-American relafions. 
Community groups targeted for participation have included the clergy. Lions, 
Rotary, League of Women Voters, and Ihe AAUW. The Center's goal, briefly 
stated, is to try to bring topics that people read about and hear about every day — 
things that affect our every day lives — to the community and bring about an 
interplay between the community and the university 

The Center for Global Studies was founded in 1978 by a committee headed by 
James Becker of the Social Studies Development Center and Howard Mehlinger, 
professor in the School of Education in Bloomington. Dr, Coufoudakis was a 
member of that committee. When professor Metilinger became dean of the School 
of Education, Dr, Coufoudakis was tapped for the directorship, and the Center was 
moved to Fort Wayne. Dr. Coufoudakis is quick to point out that, although the 
Center is now headquartered in Fort Wayne, all administration is still done 
through Bloomington. There is, however, a steering committee on each of the eight 
campuses 

Dr Coufoudakis is presentlyon sabbatical leave in Greece, where he is heading

Resolution requests input in chancellor selection 



By MICHELE R. SHAFFER 
Managing Editor 

The IPFW Student Senate 
unanimously passed a resolution 
Wednesday, March 19, requesting an 
audience with each chancellor finalist 
selected by the (Chancellor Search and 
Screen Committee. 

"We have a group which is 
requesting an interview with 
prospective chancellors," said Gina 
Kostoff, student body vice president. 
The group's aim, according to 
Resolution a586-J. is to represent "the 
student concerns and communicate 
student opinions " 

Kostoff justified the resolution, 



saying the Students Government 
represents the students and therefore 
should voice their concerns to 
prospective chancellors. "Because 
we're the recognized representative of 
the students, we should be allowed to 
speak with the prospective chancellors 
to voice student concerns," said 
Kostoff- 

Sandra Flum, the student senator 
who authored the resolution, agreed 
on the importance of having Ihe 
prospective chancellors meet with the 
students '"I feel Ihal it is very im- 
portant for a student organization to 
convey our concerns to the candidates 
and the Student Senate seems the most 



Related editorial and 
cartoon/Page 2 



obvious means of doing this," said 
Flum. 

John Ulmer. dean of student ser- 
vices, confirmed the fact that practice 
in the past has coincided with these 
views. Historically, prospective 
candidates for the chanc^lorship have 
met with a group of campus 
representatives and discussed student 
concerns. 



In other business: 

The student senate passed, ten to 
one, Resolution 85"^L, approving a 
proposed revision of Monday, Wed- 
nesday and Friday afternoon classes. 
The proposed time pattern of Monday 
and Wednesday classes would be from 
1:30 lo 2:45 p.m. ,3 to 4: 15 p.m. and -1:30 
to 5 45 p.m. The resolution, authored 
by Jill Adamson. student senator, 
states the proposed times "correspond 
better to the current bus schedule" for 
bus riders. It also states the revision 
will allow students to "more fully 
partake of both full and part-time job 
opportunities with this new 
scheduling "

Give senate a voice 
in chancellor selection 



The role of the Students Government is 
accurately representing the concerns of 
students. Part of that job is to discuss the 
concerns of students with the 
administration. 

Therefore, it would only be sensible 
the Students Government be allowed 
to meet with prospective chancellors. 

The Students Government is 
requesting that opportunity through 
Resolution 8586-J which was passed at 
the senate meeting on March 19, The 
resolution states that since the Students 
Government is the official recognized 
body for shjdent concerns, they should 
be allowed to meet for approximately 30 
minutes with each candidate "for the 
purpose of representing the student 
concerns and communicate student 
opinions." 

We agree with this resolution, not only 
because the proposal allows students to 
voice concerns, but it allows prospective 
chancellors to meet students and see 



how the Students Government functions, 
John Ulmer, dean of student services, 
confirmed the fact that historically, 
prospective chancellors have met with 
campus representatives to discuss 
student concerns, among these 
representatives being the Students 
Government Such an opportunity would 
afford students and the candidates the 
chance to interact and get to know one 
another. 

For the university to accept the 
students' proposal would be precedent 
setting also. It would be another 
opportunity for Purdue University 
President Steven Beering to prove that 
he respects student opinion. Since the 
new management agreement took affect 
last fall, Purdue University really has 
full control of many activities on 
campus. This would be an opportunity 
for them to show everyone that they 
believe in, respect and practice open 
communication. 



Indiana once condoned 
possession of slaves

Guest Writer 

Fellow IPFW students, 

staff, and administration — 

what (io you know about 

Indiana history^ Are you 

Commentary 

aware that Indiana was 
admitted to the Union in 
1816. and before her 
statehood, ihe Northwest 
Ordinance of 1787 provided a 
law that prohibited slavery 
in our present Hoosier State, 
after 17«7? However, it also 
Stated that those settlers 
who had slaves did find 
freedom here. For example, 
even though the above 
legislation did exist, some 
Indiana residents wanted 
slavery and others did not — 
like Judge Henry Van- 
derburgh, Judge George 



Turner, and Territorial 
Governor Arthur St, Clair. 
Each had acted on the 




The Indians who lived here 
tor some time raided towns 
on the Ohio River, and 
brought black slaves back to 




India 



to 



live. Fur-

where some blacks were 
freed and others were not . 



thermore, can you believe 
thai the American Gover- 
nment gave a slave to an 
Indian chief known as Little 

Turtle? The same govern- 
ment that wanted the North- 
west Ordinance also gave a 
human being, a slave, as 
pari of a peace treaty. Will 
wonders never cease?

To the Editor: 

The upcoming Students 
Government elections on 
Tuesday and Wednesday, 
April 8 and 9, offer a unique 
opportunity for IPFW 
students. 

The opportunity is one of 
involvement; involvement in 
changes; involvement in 
decision-making; in- 
volvement in budget control 
and expenditures; in- 
volvement m campus en- 
tertainment SX\i extra- 
curricular speakers; in- 
volvement in policy- 
restatement, student rights, 
contract negotiating, ad- 
ministration and faculty 
communications, social 
events, inier-campus 
relations, new-project 

funding ... my list could go 



The point is that students 



are by far the "majority" on 
campus. Students are also 
the primary consumer of the 
service products of IPFW, 
Reciprocally, students are a 
product of their education 
and experiences. 

Because each student is an 
integral part of the 
university system, each 
student is automatically 
■'involved" in IPFW, On 
April a and 9, students have 
the opportunity to exercise 
some degree of involvement. 

There are _at_least_ two_ 
general levels of par- 
ticipation Firstly, please 
take the time to vote! Ballots 
will be available in the 
basement of Kettler Hall. 
Requirements to vote are a 
minimum of six credit hours 
and a photo I, D. 

Secondly, consider run- 
ning for Students Govern- 
ment. There are three 
executive offices; student 



body president. vice 
president and SUBOG chair. 
There are !8 senate seats 
and n SUBOG seats open to 
students. Executive offices 
require a substantial amount 
of time investment, but 
individual seats require little 
more than three to four 
working hours per week. 
Senate is Ihe policy-making 
arm and SUBOG is the 
creative money-spending 
(programming) branch of 
Students Government, Your 
.parJicipalioD is. wplmmwi 



Your campus needs your 
ideas and talents. Don't be 
afraid to jumpin! 

More pragmatically, both 
propseclive employers and 
professional schools view a 
student's extra-curricular 
involvement as exceptional. 
Remember, any and all 
ability-building experience 
adds to your depth as an 
individual. As commuler- 



SUBOG has sponsored 
vacation trips to Colorado 
and Florida, guest speakers, 
a Tommy Dorsey concert 
and a weekend movie series, 
among others. Yet this 
Spring will be Harbor Arbor 
Days, with an on-campus 
rock concert. Plans are 
t)eing made to move Harbor 
Arbor Days to the fall and to 
co-sponsor a major rock 
concert with the Coliseum 
next fall 
How do you get involved? 
-i,Dt.er-camRus-v^,and -state — Eetilions.ar,e-avai)able in the 



campus students, we are atl 
familiar with the value- 
adding experience of a

that. 

This past year. Students

Plans for this year's Arbor 
Harbor Days are well un- 
derway, according to 
Elizabeth Schleuter, 
chairman of the committee 
to organize the Harbor Arbor 
Days. 

Schleuter, a member of 
the Student Union Board of 
Governors (SUBOG), staled 
there are events for almost 
every day of the week, April 
H to 18 On Monday and 
Tuesday, April H and 15, 
Jane Lybrand will be on 



campus to discuss body 
language. She was scheduled 
to speak last fall, but can- 
celled her appearance due to 
illness. 

On Wednesday, Henry Lee 
Summer will appear in 
concert at 3:30 p.m. outside 
the Walb Memorial Union. 

Thursday, a College Bowl 
contest will be held at 5 p.m. 
According lo Schleuter and 
Gina Kostoff, student body

kind of like a huge trivial 
pursuit game. "We'll have 
as many teams as we get."

teams of five people and a S5 
entry fee per team. The 
conlesi will be played in the 
Green Room of The Fori in 
Walb Memorial Union,

clude Friday with a party al 
the Hoagland Hayloft.

week." said Schleutcr,

Fort Wayne artists were busy all winter... and we reap benefits 

See glass on a large scale at the Museum of Art 



By M.KATHLEEN 

CREVEN 

Features Editor 

The diverse use o( glass is 
demonstrated by artists with 
many points of vjew in the 
show Transparent motives: 
Glass on a l^rge Scale at the 
Museum of Art until April ZT 

Mrwds of the works in this 
show range from the thought 
provoking to the whimsical 
and more formal con- 
structions, created by the 
manipulation of the medium 

Each ol the artists was 
schooled in the traditional 
techniques of working with 
glass and they share an 
interest in making their 
statements on a large scale 
— one that frequently ad- 
dresses the environment. 
The artists have used glass 



to transmit or reflect light, 
as an invisible support for 
paintings or as a material 
asserting its own physical 
presence. 

An mtroductory slide tape 
presentation, viewed in the 
orientation room, provides a 
valuable preview o( the 
show, showing how galss is 
blown and describing the 
properties of the medium. A 
brief history of gloss and 
some thoughts on the current 
installation add some in- 
sightful background in- 
formation about the artist's

received. II was a disaster — 
he donned a hat lo disguise 
Ihe damage. Scatters of 
barbed wire pieces form 
exclamation points, making 
visible the aggravation felt 
by the "wire head" 
character. 

The Damaged Bone 
Scries, ISGH, is in a much 
more serious vein. This 
collection of twisted glass 
forms represent the suf- 
fering felt by the artist and 
fellow occupants of a 
hospital during his tour of 
Vietnam, The artist spent 
lime in an orthopaedic 



hospital and translated this 
experience into bandaged 
and braced bone shapes that 
are a haunting metaphor for 
human suffering. 

The fine line between 
illusion and reality is pur- 
posely smudged in the in- 
stallation I2-I3-SS, as 
triangular planes transform 
shadow, open space and 
painted surfaces into 
visually interchangable 
realities. 

Even though the artists 
created pieces to highlight 
the versatility of glass — its 
strength and fragility, its 



reflective properties and 

transparency, its sensuality 
and its coldness — each 
construction has one theme 
in common. They tajmt the 
viewer to embrace the 
human element in each, 
remembering their own 
experiences dredged up by 
this installation. 

To further immerse 
oneself in this fascinating 
medium, a series of 
workshops, Working with 
Transparencies, is available 
geared for children from 
tour to 18 years old — just in 
time for their spring 
vacation. 



Textures explored at Artlink 





Lanrtform IV by Nancy 
McCroskcy &lt;photo by Troy 

EdBington). 



By M.KATHLEEN 

GREVEN 

Features Editor 

Spring is traditionally the 
time of year when people's 
thoughts turn to the earth as 
It emerges from its shroud of 
Growth and vitality 
are uppermost on our minds. 

The artists in the show 
Haw Works explore the 
nature of life-forces through 
the use of raw materials and 
rough images. Whether 
working with these raw 
materials (clay, sticks, 
sand, metal objects, un- 
slretched canvasi or rough 
images executed with a 
refined technique, these 
artists probe the mystery of 
life's energy. Their works 
are often as unpredictable 
and without precision as the 
subject matter they are 
depicting. 

The clay pieces by 
associate instructor Nancy 
McCroskey are very organic 
looking — as though they 
sprang from Ihe earth onto 
the wall or pedestal, where 
they slubl»rnly cling. 

"My concerns are 
essentially formalistic; 
composing with line, shape 
and surface," she explained, 
" 1 am inspired by land forms 
andgeologic process." 

This explains why her wall 
pieces appear to have been 
joined as the compacted 
layers of earth shifted, 
possibly encasing century- 
old fossils. 

McCroskey added that she 
utilizes the earth's events 



"lo both fracture and unite 
the forms, attempting to 
retain a sense of balance and 
wholeness through changes 

Another instructor, Gregg 
Coffee, works in a style that 
is reminiscent at limes of a 
portion from the movie 
Fantasia "Night on Skull 
Mountain." The movie 
depicts nocturnal warriors 
floating through the sti)l 
night air, wreaking havoc 
along theway. 

Sections of Coffee's work 
al Artlink is "bare bones," 
making use of skeletal forms 
that may have once been the 
framework of pre-historic 
creatures. 

Coffee believes that "raw 
is not synonymous with 
primitive, neo- 

expressionism, 'art brut' or 
any of the plethora of buzz 
words and catch phrases 
that litter the landscape of 
art history." he explained, 
"but rather with the state of 
mind lor heart) that the 
artist is in when the work is 
given birth." 

The idea for this show was 
conceived by Marilyn Bock- 
Tobolski, another IPFW 
instructor, by a show she 
saw in Chicago two years 
ago. As member of Artlink's 
panel, she put together a 
show that "exposed the 
undercurrents of primal 
energy that covers our 
genteel exteriors." 

The show may be seen at 
Artlink, 1126 Broadway, 
until April 26.

Buzz and the Doctor will get you on your way

BvfURISLaVIGNE 
SI Bit Writer 

"It's a FriiiDay, b-b- 
baby!" Dr West's voice 
Uiunders across the air- 
waves as he and Buzz-Baby 
awaken sleepy rockers 
around the Fori. 

Anything goes on WXKEs 
morning show hosted by 
"Doctor" Rick West and 
Buzz Maxwell. "Where do 
people lo, uh ... snuggle?" 
the Doctor asked one 
morning. "Well ... there's 
this little backroad by IPFW 
..." Buzz's voice (railed off 
as he tried to think of other 
(amous snuggle spots. 

The Doctor, married and 
the rather of two "rock tots," 
is something ot a rock and 
roll trivia master. From the 
Drifters to the Romantics, 
he has the scoop. "My job is 
my hobby," he explains 
matter of factly, then muses 
to himself, "I should get a 
hobby,.," 

Buzz says his job is "a job 
like any other job," If he 
wasn't a disc jockey, being a 
race car driver or living in 
the Yukon would suit him 
just fine. 

WXKE's target audience 
is the 18-34 age group and 
West says they try to discuss 
topics of interest to those 
listeners — and they're good 
at il. The Doctor says, ''We 
live like they do because we 
are them." The Doctor is 34, 
Buzz, 25. 

"I just bought a house, like 



a lot of people (in this age 
group) and I had two kids, or 
my wife did," the Doctor 
explains "1 have an apart- 
ment and two cats," Buzz 
interjects "\Vben I was little 
everytxidy did that. I 
thought, well, I'm 24. lime to 
get cats." 

"I'm allergic to caLs," 
says the Doctor with a slight 
frown. "You can get pills for 
that," Buzz suggests help- 
fully. 

Buzz says that he also tries 
lo appeal to the interests of 
the target audience. This is 
done primarily through his 
newscasts which seem to 
follow three loosely applied 
rules- I) Anything in rock 
and roll is news, 2) Anything 
on David Letterman is news, 
and 3) Things that are 
strange and trivial are also 
fascinating and can 
masquerade as news. 

He says, "Whatever in- 
terests me, 1 figure will 
interest other people, "cause 
I'm kinda average." His 
interests include the 
Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, 
who he wants to relocate in 
New Haven, and whatever 
odd-ball bits of information 
he can dig up in USA Today, 

But don't get the idea that 
these two are all jokes, 
banter and oddball trivia. At 
the time of this interview, 
Buzz admitted that he was 
exhausted after being up for 
thelasl iShoursand had just 
enough time to dash home 



for a shoWer before he t&gt;egan 

yet another hectic day. 

What's on his agenda? 
"Buzzing'' downtown with 
the Doctor lo sell daffodils to 
benefit the American Cancer 
Society. The station has t&gt;een 
involved in many fund- 
raising activities — along 
with the Good News Bears, 
they played basketball to 
raise funds for the Arthritis 
Foundation. Tbey also work 
for Jerry's Kids during the 
Muscular Dystrophy 
telethon and with the 
Daybreak Children's 
Shelter. 

When they don't forge! 
about them, the morning 
show includes a comedy 
block, featured somewhere 
between eight and nine 
o'clock, a Buzz word, and a 
morning stumper. The latter 
two are chances for listeners 
lo win valuable prizes such 
as free Subway Subs and Pat 
Benatar albums. 

Of central importance to 
the morning show is not 
witty DJ bantering or 
amusing gimmicks, but 
rather a healthy dose of rock 
and roll, not to be confused 
with pop music. WXKE is 
Fort Wayne's only album- 
oriented rock lAOR) station 
and the Doctor says they just 
have a feel for the difference 
between pop and rock music. 
"A lot of times the audience 
draws the line," he adds. 
"They'll call you up and say 
'What are you doing? "■ 



For example, responding 
to listener's wishes, 104 
avoided Michael Jackson for 
some lime, but finally caved 
in and began playing 
"Thriller " "Michael 
Jackson was the biggest 
thing in music, and we 
thought we had to do 
something." West explains. 

Both the Doctor and Buzz 
draw a sharp line between 
AOR and top 40 jocks. The 
top 40 market is more teen- 
oriented and West explains 



that the jocks are "you 

image of the typical DJ." 
"1,1, 1, "mimics Buzz, 
The Doctor agrees, 
"They're wrapped up in 
themselves. The biggest 
jerks in radio work top 40." 

Ttie pair calls the Fort's 
top 40 market "real slow" 
and say they have no trouble 
finding new artists and new 
hits before other local 
stations. "We'll get a new 
album before they know it 
exists," says West. 
He also offers some advice 



to those who are considering 
broadcasting careers. "If 
you're thinking about getting 
into radio, don't do it unless 
you're crazy. II can be like 
driving a bus. Unless you 
can make it fun ..." he 
shakes hishead 

The Doctor has a B.S. in 
communication from Ohio 
State and says, "A lot of 
people think college isn't 
important, but it is. You 
don't need it but you won't 
get anywhere without it."

BREAKFAST

6:00 a,m.-9;30 p.m. 
K-Mart Plaza. North 




Freshman Terri Lydy has 
received two conference 
awards for her record set- 
ling year on the IPFW 
women's basketball learn 
Ihisseason. 

Lydy is the only freshman 
named lo Ihe All -Conference 
team in the Greal Lakes 
Valley Conference and she 
has also been named 
Newcomer of the Year. 

Lydy set two GLVC 
retxiunding records this 
season. The 5-11 freshman 
grabbed 171 rebounds in 
sixteen games and pulled in 
22 rebounds against St. 
Joseph's alone. Lydy's 171 
rebounds gave her a con- 
ference leading 10, i 
rebounding average for the 
season and her 16.3 points 



per game was good enough 
for sixth place overall in the 
GLVC. 

Lydy began her basketball 
career at Heritage Jr,-Sr. 
High School when she was in 
the seventh grade. 

Phil Lydy, her father, 
spent many evenings and 
weekends helping Lydy with 
her game; "He was a big 
motivator." Lydy's own 
hard work and all the help 
she received along Ihe way 
paid oft in ISBZ as the 
Heritage Patriots won the 
girl's state basketball 
championship and made it to 
the final four the next 
season. 

The highly recruited Lydy 
said, "I picked IPF^ 
because 1 fell it's a better 
school than the otiiers I 
visited and I'm still dose to 
home." 



"The Newcomer of the 
Year award is a real honor," 
Coach Julie Calahan said, 
"Il's an award voted on by 
all of the opposing coaches in 
the conference and it isn't 
only limited lo freshmen Il's 
open to Junior College 
transfers and anyone else in 
their first season in the 
GLVC, Terri has worked 
hard and I feel these honors 
are well deserved." 

Lydy also added I wo IPFW 

records to her list of credits : 
she finished the season with 
252 rebounds in 25 game'- ii nd 
she had seven steals in -mo 
game against Wayne Slate 
In the final two games of the 
season against Lewis and St, 
Joseph's, Lydy poured in a 
combined total of 52 points 
and pulled down 36 
rebounds.

Gebert great player for IPFW 



ByTONYDUNAWAY 
Staff Writer 

Loren Gebert had only 
played one year of volleyball 
prior lo entering IPFW, but 
his four years under Coach 
Arnie Ball have brought him 
many awards and national 
recognition. 

As a freshman at IPFW, 
Gebert received (he Most 
Improved Player Award and 
went to the National Sports 
Festival in Colorado 
Springs, Colorado. 

As a sophomore. Gebert 
was invited lo the Junior 
Olympics in Chicago and 
was also voted the Most 



Valuable Player (or the 
Volleydons. In this, his 
senior year, as well as his 
junior year, Gebert received 
honorable mention All- 
American honors. 

Coach Ball describes his 
star outside hitter, "He has 
learned a lot and he always 
works hard. He has over- 
come some great personal 
tragedies and has developed 
inloagreat player." 

Despite all of his 
recognition. Gebert has 
remained a polite and 
almost humble young man. 
"I couldn't have gotten any 
of the recognition 1 have, if it 



wasn't for everyone on our 
team," said Gebert. 
"Everyone on our team is 
friends l&gt;oth on and off of the 
court." 

On the topic of Coach Ball, 
Gebert has nothing but 
words of praise. "QiacbBall 
has brought the Volleydons a 
long way in the past three 
seasons and thanks to Coach 
Ball, IPFW is now getting 
national recognition, " 

On down the road, Getjert 
hopes to make the world 
University Team and then 
use his education major to 
enter coaching.

Staff Writer 

During Spring break, the 
Volleydons and Coach Arnie 
Ball traveled to' California 
for a West Coast tour. While 
on the West Coast, the 
Volleydons played four 
teams: Long Beach, 
Chapman College, Santa 
Barbara, and University of 
California at San Diego. 

On March 11, the 
Volleydons dropped three 
straight lo Long Beach: il- 
ls, 9-15, and 17-19. 

On Mardcb N, the 
Volleydons dropped three 
straight lo Santa Barbara: 2- 
15.2-15, and 13-15. Coach Ball 
comments, "Long Beach 
had just beat UCLA, which 
shows how strong of a team 
they are. The game was very 
competitive, very good. The 
scores were close. It was the 
first game of our series, we 
felt good about it. Jay 
Goldsteyn was injured in the 
third game of the match at 
LongBeach. He had tb sit out 
the resl of the trip. Overall, 
the intensity level of the 
match was very high." On 
Santa Barbara, the only 
thing Coach Ball had lo say 



was, "We played good, Sanla 
Barbara had just got beat by 
UCLA, they were angry, and 
theyjust l&gt;eat uponus," 

The Volleydons won on 
March 13 when they played 
Chapman College. They 
defeated Chapman 15-7, 7-lS. 
15-4, 11-16, and 15-a, Again, 
Coach Ball feels both teams 
played exceptionally, "They 
really had two good quality 
players. It was a good match 
for both learns." 

On March IS. the 
Volleydons played their last 
game of the series. They lost 
to the University of 
California at San Diego. The 
score for the games were 13- 
15. 16-18, 15-12, 15-3, and 10- 
15, The San Diego match 
took three hours to play. 
Again both teams played 
well. "We had never been lo 
the West Coast before. We 
fell so good about our per- 
formance. We could have 
went out feeling really in- 
timidated, but we had the 
right attitude. Going to 
California . will make the 
other teams more aware of 
us when the National 
rankings are out. We got to 
visit with coaches and. 



players. It was a plus for us 
lo go to California, It was as 
good for the University as il 
was (or the volleyball 
program. There is a strong 
possibility that one team will 
come here; we would really 
like to go back,*" 



Boilermakers blasted
