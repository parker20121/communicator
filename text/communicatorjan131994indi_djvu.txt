Advisor has diverse background 

Lake to serve 
Multicultural 
Services 

by Rantona Mcgown 
Editor in chief 

The oTficc of mulilcultural ser- 
vices has obtained a new adviser for 
the 1994 spring semesler. Tun Lake, 
3 Fori Wayne native and an R. Nel- 
son Snider high school graduate, 
will soon be joining Ihe muUicultur- 
al services administrative staff at 
IPFW. 

Lake will be filling the position 
that was previously held by Charles 
Washington, who is now serving as 
associate director of career services. 

After Washington vacated the po- 
sition in multicultural services in 
early October of "93, a search com- 
mittee made up of both students and 
administrative persons decided that 
Tim Lake, a former IPFW student, 
was the best candidate. 

"IPFW feels like home to me and I 
feel like my whole career was mov- 
ing me to this [xisition," said Lake. 

As a graduate of Ball State Uni- 
versity where he acquired his B.S. 
in Speech Communications. Lake 
then moved on to Howard Universi- 
ty where he Juiished his M.A. in arts 
and religious studies. After receiv- 
ing 3 scholarship at the University 
of Notre Dame. Lake decided to 
complete another M.A. in the Arts 
of Systematic Theology. 

As the adviser to the African- 
American students, some of Lake's 
principal duties will include over- 
seeing the Mastering the Possibili- 
ties program, aiding in the retention 
of African- Amen can students, and 
helping those students in danger of 
probation. Lake will also serve as 
adviser to the BCC. 




Lake said that he feels very strong- 
ly about the need to improve com- 
munication between the students 
and university administration. 

"I hope to bridge the gap between relate not only to a number of peo- 
the administiation and the students," pie, but also to the diverse affairs of 
said Lake. the multicultural services.

of colleges, each of which has a 
unique atmosphere. Lake said that 
he believes that he will be able to

Students urged 
to consider 
college education 

by Ramona Mcgown 
Editor in chief 

The lime has rolled around once 
again for students and the participat- 
ing faculty of the multicultural ser- 
vices office to start recruiting iPFW 
students to take part in both the 
Mastering the Possibilities Program 
and the Making it Happen program 
also known as the Hactendo Reali- 
dad program. 

Mastering the possibilities pro- 
gram was sponsored and founded 
from Ihe multicultural services pro- 
gram in 1987, from this Making it 
Happen was then produced, target- 
ing the Hispanic students. 

Both programs were formed to 
reach out to both African-American 
students and Hispanic students in 



the school system who normally 
would not think of college as reality 
for them to take part in. 

The programs were founded not 
only to make higher education a 
greater reality for Ihe students, but it 
also makes an opportunity for the 
one-on-one contact with the IPFW 
students and to build friendships 
with middle and high school stu- 
dents 

"This is a great opportunity for 
IPFW students to not only get in- 
volved with their younger peers in 
the community but also to build 
stronger leadership and communica- 
tion skills in the same process," said 
Paulina Salvador, advisor for His- 
panic students. 

The Primary ideals or points that 
each program tries to gel across to 
the students is the faa thai a college 
education is essential and that it 
may take work but it can be a realily 
if those students really want a high- 
er education. 



The programs also wish to make 
those students begin to think of fu- 
ture financial and social prepara- 
tions that arc needed as well for col- 
lege. The program also stresses the 
need for Ihe development of good 
study habits and the importance of 
selling certain priorities. 

"We try to gel to reach middle and 
high school students in the pro- 
grams and even those who attend 
the Anthis Career Center," said Sal- 
vador. 

The program will concenlrale pri- 
marily with middle and high school 
students. Paulina Salvador and Tim 
Lake will be the two advisors pri- 
marily responsible for the program 
and its recruitment of IPFW stu- 
dents to participate. 

Any student wishing to participate 
in either Making it Happen or the 
Mastering the Possibilities programs 
should contact cither Paulina Sal- 
vador or Tim Lake at Ihe Multicul- 
tural Services Center at 6608.

Film Series 

SAB reschedules time of movie 



by RamoDQ Mcgown 
Editor in chief 

This year SAB has decided to 
change the lime of the movies 
shown in CM 159. The movies will 
no longer be scheduled at their usu- 
al lime of 7:30 Wednesday, but 
rather at 2:35 in the afternoon. 

'Towards the end of the semesler 
we really had two strong movies 
that we felt should have received 
more attendance, so the board then 
decided lo re-evaluate the schedule 



of classes and choose a more appro- 
priate time lo provide the show- 
ings," said Gregory Callen, director 
of student affairs. 

Callen said Ihe attendance of Ihe 
students used lo average 40 to 60 
people a couple of years ago, but 
has since decreased to an average of 
12 to 20. 

"In Ihe past Ihe movies were 
shown at noon. We then had the 
problem with students having to 
leave for class and we again decided 
to re-evaluate the situation and 



make a change," said Callen. 

With Ihe help of IPFW student 
Andy Gottfired, who took time to 
study the class schedules, the board 
then came up with a lime they felt 
would improve the student atten- 
dance. 

SAB has decided to hand out free 
coupons for the first showing of the 
movie for this semester. "Indecent 
Proposal" will be the first film 
shown on Wednesday, Jan, 13, at 
2;35p.m. inCM 159. •

STAFF EDITORIAL 

Have African-Americans 
progressed or digressed 



Believe il or noi. but ihc 
African-American community of 
Fori Wayne and the resi of Ihis 
country have forgotten the rea- 
sons for Ihe civil righls move- 
menl. 

Some African-Americans have 
accepicd Ihe while man's pleas- 
cr's lesi. They no longer look lo 
each oiher for support. Instead, 
African -Americans find their sup- 
port in landing high paying jobs, 
losing self in European culture, 
and isolating themselves from the 
condition of African-Americans, 
physically and mentally. 

Some professional African- 
Americans as well as ministers 
have moved out of Ihe "ghetlo" or 
black neighborhoods and into Ihc 
"safe" while suburbs. Unfortu- 
nately, these people no longer 
have anything lo do with the 
black community unless it is go- 
ing to church lo worship Cod, and 
that place just happens to be in 
the '■inner" city. 

There is no support for black en- 
leiprise. Other ethnic groups have 
created successful and thriving 
businesses in Ihe African -Ameri- 
can community because of Ihe 
lack of support for black-owned 
businesses. 

Black churches no longer have 
the respect and values that used to 
be the foundation of the commu- 
nity. Instead of being viewed as 
community leaders, some minis- 
ters arc caught up in (he politics 
of drugs, sex, and, of course, 
making the buck off Iheir congre- 
gations. 

African-American families no 
longer have unity because of the 
current self-genocide that is tak- 
ing place in the form of drugs, 
gangs, alcohol (look ai number of 
liquor stores in Ihe African- 
American community), teen preg- 
nancies, AIDS, black-on-black 
crime, and the lack of a solid edu- 
cation. Statistics show that at leasl 
70 perceni of young African- 
American men are either in jail, 
going lo jail, deceased, drug ad- 
dicts, or simply confused. 

Where are the neighborhood 
schools that used lo provide guid- 
ance and an effective education 
throughout the black communi- 
ties? 
They have been replaced with 
integrated schools thai allow 
African -American students lo be 
labeled "slow," a "discipljoe'^ 
problem, and of course, students 
thai arc "at-risk." 

The school system fails to real- 
ize that because of Ihe disinlegra- 
tion of morals and values in the 
United Stales, all of our children 
are "at-risk." 

African-Americans can eat in 
restaurants (unless Ihey go lo 
Denny's) and knock elbows with 
Ihe elite in today's society. How- 
ever, what African -Americans fail 
to realize is that the moveraenl 
wasn't about eating a meal with 
while folks, it was about Ihe right 



to have human righls given lo 
everyone on this planet by God. 

The civil righls movement was a 
direct protest to the unfair, cruel. 
and iess-than-human treatment 
white people have perpetrated 
againsi people of color. African- 
Americans in particular. 

It appears that a portion of 
African-Americans have taken 
ownership to the shame of having 
ancestors as slaves; therefore, de- 
stroying (he self-esteem, family 
unity and values that should have 
continued after the civil rights 
movement. By taking ownership 
of this undeserved "shame," 
African -Americans have begun to 
play a part in their own self-geno- 
cide by playing into the stereo- 
types of being drug dealers or 
"savages" who kill each other. 
Look at the number of pregnant 
teenage mothers. S(a(is(ics show 
that over 50 perccnl of AIDS cas- 
es in Indiana are within communi- 
ties of color. 

Why? 

Because African -Americans arc 
still slaves. 

How can anyone say thai? 
African-Americans no longer 
have shackles on their ankles. 

No. Ihe shackles are now 
wrapped around their minds. 
Slavery exists today because 
African-Americans slopped 
emancipating their minds after the 
civil rights movement. 

It is one thing lo have civil 
rights. And it is another thing to 
use civil righls. When Ihe rights 
are not used, Ihey no longer exist. 
It's sad to say, but il has happened 
nol only in Fon Wayne but aaoss 
Ihis "great" nation of ours. 

The National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People 
or NAACP in Fort Wayne no 
longer has Ihe power it once pos- 
sessed. The NAACP now seems 
to be an organization keeping 
African-Americans in "their" 
place by equipping the group with 
ineffeclive and non-motivational 
leadership. 

The only organization Ihai ap- 
pears lo be somewhat active in re- 
juvenating the African -American 
community in Fori Wayne is the 
Urban League, led by Joyce Mal- 
lory. 

How do African -Americans stop 
Ihe self-deslruclion of their own 
ethnic group? 

First. African-Americans musi 
begin to correct the past years of 
bad faith and cruelly wiihin their 
own communities since the civil 
righls movement. The only way 
lo do Ihis is by restoring self-es- 
teem and self-respect within self 
first. 

The next step is to break the old 
cycles, develop new leaders that 
will lead the NAACP and other 
black organizations in positive di- 
rection. 

Then the issue of "how far have 
African -Am en cans come" can be 
fully addressed. 



Comment of the week: 

"Violence as a way of achieving racial justice is both 
impractical and immoral. It is impractical because il 
is a descending spiral ending in destruction for all., .It 
is immoral because it seeks to humiliate the opponent 
rather than win his understanding; it seeks to annihi- 
late rather than to conven...il thrives on hatred rather 
than love."

Letters to the editor 

Clocks need correction 



Dear Edilor, 

While I realize Ihe importance of 
accommodating our many interna- 
tional and oul-of-sialc students, is il 
really necessary to set each clock on 
campus to their individual slates or 
countries? For example, in Keltler 
hall, east wing, one clock face reads 
eastern lime (currently, Indiana's), 
while the other side of Ihe same 
clock gives central lime (currently, 
Illinois and other midwestem slates' 



time.) Meanwhile, on Keitler's sec- 
ond Hoor, the clock on the east side 
of the stairwell displays eastern lime 
on one side, while Ihe other side has 
languished at 5;20 for the last sever- 
al years. Fortunately, there's a sun- 
dial in Ihe midst of the IPFW geo- 
garden which is usually within a 
half of an hour — during sunlight 
— of Ihe correct lime. 

Sincerely, 
Graig Stettncr 



Students defend cartoon 



To the Editor, 

The letter lo the editor that ap- 
peared in the November 18 Commu- 
nicator was ridiculous, 

HELLO!!?? Have you ever seen 
the cartoon known as 'Garfield?' It 
contains numerous references lo 
Gatlield's apparent lack of physical 
fitness. Did you write to Ihe Associ- 
ated Press and whine about that? 

Listen. If you think about it, all hu- 
mor makes fun of somebody. Come- 
dy is based on ridicule in one form 
or another. As people grow up, they 
normally come to accept this fact. 
Besides, Ihis newspaper has been 
lacking quality cartoons until Ihis 
one. When 1 read that cartoon I ac- 
tually laughed — what a concept! 

We thought that Ihe cartoon was 



funny, nol offensive. So we did a lit- 
tle survey in the basement of Ket- 
tler. 

In answer lo the question, "Read 
Ihis comic and tell me if it offends 
you or nol," 30 people, 15 males 
and 15 females were polled. 29 re- 
sponded thai Ihey were not offended 
by Ihe comic. Only one out of 30 
people surveyed was offended (and 
she even laughed at it!). The student 
body seemed to agree with us in the 
fact that this cartoon was nol offen- 
sive. Hopefully this will help Ihe 
staff of the Communicator realize 
that they finally have a good, fiinny 
cartoon lo keep us amused. 

Cartoon fan.s.

Openers are for the disabled 



To the editor, 

I have a student in my class who 
has cercbal palsy. She must walk 
with the aid of a walker and relies on 
the elevators to get from floor lo 
floor in the buildings. One day she 
was unable to make il lo class be- 
cause Ihe elevator was out of order. 

That incideni reminded me of how 
concemed I was when Ihe automatic 
door opener ai ihe library was oul of 
order just al the beginning of this 
Fall semester. My concern turned in- 
to anger when il'was out of order for 
days on end. That is Ihe only access 
lo Ihe library for those who must rely 
on Ihe automatic door opener. I re- 
gret thai I do nol know why it was 
oul of order, I asked my student how 
she managed. She struggled to the 
door open on her own, and she somc- 
s someone would come along 
and help. 

Every building on campus has ai 



leasl one access with automatic door 
openers. They arc there for the spe- 
cific use of those who, because of a 
physical disability, musi rely on them 
in order to gain entry into a building. 
Yei, lime after time I see ihem used 
by people walking quite capably on 
two legs, carrying little more than a 
book or a purse. Wilh nary a thought 
that its overused and abused could 
render them out of order as well, 
these people stride up to the door, tap 
Ihe opening, and like a personal valel 
Iheir door is opened before them. 

If this is your praciice. please be 
conscious of why those door openers 
have been placed at entrances. It is 
not for your use. but your overuse 
could prevent access for those who 
do need Ihem, And as you open Ihe 
door on your own accord and 
strength, be thankful thai you can. 

Sincerely, 

Betly Tbnsing

Sharing thoughts 
with Edward 



Editor's Noie: "Sharing thoughts 
with Edward" will be a weekly col- 
umn that will appear in Ihe Commu- 
nicator. Anyone who would like lo 
contribute their ideas and comments 
lo better Ihe publication should feel 
free to contact anyone in Ihe office of 
Ihc Communicator. 

Often the theme that "life is pre- 
cious" is used by pro-life forces lo 
further their cause. In general, every- 
one would likely agree ihai life is in- 
deed precious. At leasl Iheir own life 
is. Everybody else's life is probably 
closer lo semiprecious. 

But jusi how precious is life? I 
mean is your life as precious as, say, 
a new Chevrolet Camero? And docs 
everyone rale the same level of prc- 
ciousness? Or is ihere a range? Per- 
haps a high school dropout hooked 
on crack tales a '74 Vega. A person 
with a high school diploma and a tie- 
cent job may be a lale model GM 
pickup. And a recent lU grad would, 
most likely, fall somewhere In be- 

For the sake of argument, let's soy 
everyone is the same -- a valuable 
Rolls Royce, Well, we wouldn't want 
to allow abortions -- who would wani 
lo destroy a new Rolls. Of course, we 
wouldn't need birth control either -■ 
why would we want to prevent the 
production of something precious 
new? Hell, we should, in fact, al- 
pi to maximize Ihe prcciousncss 



in Ihe world by mandating that each 
woman have as many children at 
possible. Some might think that's b 
pretty good idea actually. 

I have talked to my economics pro- 
fessor about this very topic. He said 
that the prcciousncss of n life is in- 
versely proportional to Ihe popula- 
tion in its life space. In olher words, 
the more people you have living 
around you, Ihe less precious your 
life is. That sort of makes sense 
course, each of us would desire t 
crease our value I would recommend 
a combat rifle wilh the largest clip 
possible (remember lo buy Ameri- 
can). Go oul into the streets and start 
mowing down anyone you see. Wilh 
each decrease in papulation you gain 
in wealth. 

Some have argued that Ihe prc- 
ciousncss of life is determined by a 
combination of self-worth, the devo- 
tion of family and friends, and the re- 
spect of and for strangers. Bui, over 
the years a callousness has grown in 
oiir nation along with the debt. It is 
revealed when you look at inner city 
youths, Haitian boat people, AIDS 
patients, and victims of Ihe Bosnian 
war. We arc Ihe strangers. If i choose 
or you choose to lum away and not at 
least give these people a chance for a 
quality life, we are all diminished. 
Life is precious, but nol as precious 
as il could or should be. 
Next Week : Gays in the Mililary 



Dear Edilor, 

Excuse me, but only one student 
wrote about the changes in Ihe The- 
atre Depanmenl? What about me? 1 
could swear I saw the letter thai I 
wrote on Ihe page opposite of Mark 
Hart's. I realize that il was about five ' 
pages shorter, but doesn't il count? 

Anyway, as for Mark Snyder. I'm 
sick of hearing about him. I would 
love to see "Snyder Gets a Clue and 
Realizes No One Cares Whal He 
Thinks!" as a headline in a future is- 
sue of the newspaper, Snyder has an 
annoying way of dwelling on triviali- 
ties and trivializing important issues. 
As I said though, I'm sick of him. 



On lo important issues: 

Sniff... sniff: what is that stench? Oh, 
it's the Communicator's editorial car- 
toons! They stink. Thai last one 
should have been titled ~ An Art Stu- 
dent's Nightmare What happened to 
John Gruse? His Snyderloons always 
pul a smile on my face. And he could 
draw. If you must put a Sarah Meyers 
cartoon in, print it really small and put 
it on the sports page. 

That's Ihis student's imput. Keep up 
the good work, your editorials are 
much belter Ihat Jim Walker's were. 

Sincerely, 
Shane E. Semler 



Students want swimming pool 



Dear Editor, 

Rumor has it thai IPFW is consider- 
ing Ihe construction of an Olympic 
size swimming pool for the Hillard 
Gales Spons center. We believe this 
would be a great addition to the cam- 
pus. Presenily IPFW is Ihc fifth largest 
university in the stale wilh an enroll- 
ment of over 12,000 students. Yel it 
lacks the notoriety of some of Ihc 
smaller schools in this region. A new 
pool facility could draw more atten- 
tion; and enhance Ihe image of Ihe 
university, and make it a showcase 
school in northeast Indiana. 

Wilh physical fitness becoming so 
prevalent in American culture, a new 
pool facility would allow IPFW to 
create a more diverse physical fitness 
academic program for its students. 
The faciliiy would allow IPFW to cre- 
ate a men's and women's swim team. 
The creation of men's and women's 
swim teams would generate money by 
hosting regular sea.son intercollegiute 
swimming events. An obvious benefit 
to hosting such events is the revenue il 
would generate. In addition, IPFW 
could hold post season regional, stale 
or national swimming events. Another 
source of revenue could come from 
leasing Ihe facility to local high 
schools for Iheir swimming events. 
The local community would also 



benefil. The University could offer 
memberships lo those outside Ihe 
campus community. Local organiza- 
tions such as Ihc American Red Cross 
would also have access to Ihc facility 
for lifeguard certification training. 
Boy's and Girl's Scouts organizations 
would be able to use the facility for 
training and cenificalion also. The fa- 
cility would also benefit Ihe senior 
Olympic and special Olympic groups 
as a place for competing and practic- 
ing. 

Critics of the swimming faciliiy 
asked if Ihe construction would cause 
an increase in annual tuition. The an- 
swer is "yes." An initial fee of fifty 
dollars would be charged to all current 
and future incoming students, which 
would allow Ihem full access to the 
facility for Ihe academic year. Stu- 
dents would Ihen have an option of re- 
newing Iheir memberships for the next 
school year, at a cost of fifteen dollars. 

IPFW is a rapidly growing campus, 
and in order to keep up wilh Ihe 
growth we need lo expand our facili- 
ties. An Olympic size pool would 
greatly benefil IPFW students and the 
surrounding community. 

Concemed students,

A dose of Douse 

Is the reproduction technique a miracle or nightmare? 



by F. Lane Douse, 
Features Editor 

II seems that science is slatting to 
look more and mote like science fic- 
lion. Can you imagine in three years 
the possibility of infertile women 
walking into the doctor's office and 
picking the type of ova ihey want lo 
have implanted into Ihem? 

According lo an article enlilled 
•'Who controls reproductive technolo- 
gy?" in the Jan. 5th issue of U.S.A. 
British scicntisl.s have successfully 
accomplished this technology by the 
feriilizaiion of ova or eggs from 
aborted fetuses in animals. 

Now, our own individual opinion of 
this controversial issue is going lo be 
based on how we view abortion. Per- 
sonally, I really don't care how peo- 
ple feel about this new scientific tech- 
nique of fertilization. I just want you 
folks to begin to think about this is- 
sue and become informed on this is- 
sue— since it will be a hot topic in the 
years lo come. 

And if there arc any feminists read- 
ing this column, then they will really 
wani to read and react! I would really 
like lo hear how you think this new 
technology will affect your lives as 
women as well as ourselves collec- 
tively. 

First, let's examine Ihe positive as- 
pect of this "new" technology. The 
only benelil from Ihis is the fact that 
infertile women will be allowed lo go 
through the childbearing experience 
which is remarkable. (Well, at least 
that is what some women have told 
me.) Since I am not a woman, I can- 
not really comment on how women 
would feel about Ihis issue, but 1 do 
have a feeling that women who don't 
have the ability to bear children 
would appreciate an opportunity like 



this as an allernalive lo surrogate 

motherhood or adoption. 

As a man, if 1 were married to a 
woman who was infertile, I would 
view this as a wonderful chance for 
mc. Yes, this is selfish, but who isn't? 
And don'i tell me that you aren't. I 
think childbearing is selfish. Think 
about it. A child does not ask to be 
brought into this world. 

People will think, boy this guy is an 
ass for writing that. However, if you 
have kids, you're selfish. It's not a 
negative thing. It's reality. Humans 
have kids because they want them. 
People want someone to love, lo car- 
ry on their name, and other wonderful 
things. There is nothing wrong with 
it. 

Personally 1 find this new technolo- 
gy awesome but the possible ramifi- 
cations of having such an ability is 
terrifying. 

The first obvious question is who 
would regulate this procedure? 

Since abortion is legal according to 
Roe vs. Wade (but we all know il is 
regulated by ihe government also), 
would the government regulate this 
new technology? Or would it be a do- 
nation similar to blood or organ dona- 
tion? 

According lo the article already 
mentioned. Dr. Duane Alexander, di- 
rector of the National Institute of 
Child Health and Human Develop- 
ment, staled that in the fall of 1994 a 
public advisory board will examine 
the issue of what to do with a human 
embryo. So, the issue is going lo be 
addressed eventually. 

Who decides? Doctors and politi- 
cians with any input from fathers and 
mothers? I doubt that. 

Another consequence of Ihis tech- 
nique could be "fetal farms," people 
making money off aborted fetuses by 



harvesting their eggs. The eggs would 
then be sold lo individuals or private 
agencies for a buck. Abortion could 
become profitable, either lo the molh- 
er or Ihe harvester or both. How 
about that as food for ihoughi? 

Finally, what about the children pro- 
duced from these eggs? The birth or 
sunogale mother would have no ge- 
netic link. Only the man who provid- 
ed the sperm that fertilized the egg 
would have the genetic link. The chil- 
dren would probably grow up having 
a similar experience similar lo adopt- 
ed children. Look at il from this 
viewpoint, the biological mother was 
only just a mass of protoplasm. So. if 
there is no mother to speak of, how 
will this absence impact the child 
bom from the egg of an aborted fe- 
tus? 

According to Webster's Encyclope- 
dia Unabridged Dictionary of the 
English Language Ihe first definition 
of rape is the act of seizing and carry- 
ing off by force. It is possible that 
some pro-life advocates feel that Ihe 
felus is a person; therefore, could this 
harvesting of eggs could be consid- 
ered the raping of a viable human be- 
ing. 

Or what about his scenario. A 
woman is infertile and has no hus- 
band but wanLs a child. So, she goes 
to her doctor and picks out an ova 
and sperm of her choice. She be- 
comes pregnant with one visit to the 
doctor's office. Now look at the num- 
ber of arguments that can be added to 
this issue. 

This new technology provides a 



whole new world of discussion in 
dealing with issue of reproductive 
rights for women. It not only applies 
addiiional pressure lo Ihe abortion is- 
sue, but also touches base on the sur- 
rogate issue and other reproductive 
techniques. 

In my opinion what Ihe issue boils 
down to is the fact thai this society 
does not value human life whatsoev- 
er. When you look at the fact that this 
country was founded on the genocide 
of Native Americans and enslave- 
ment of Africans, this new thing real- 
ly shouldn't even shock you. 

While I feel abortion should be left 
up to Ihe woman, I think we as indi- 
viduals should slop and look at how 
far advanced we are technologically, 
Scientisis have become God-like, if 
not considering themselves God. 
Now 1 wholeheartedly believe that 
God has given these men the intelli- 
gence to help create a better planet 
for us, bul Ihis is going a bit loo far. 

Sure as the saying goes, "inquiring 
minds want to know everything," but 
I think there must be limitations. 

I feel the play Medea exemplifies 
the condition of the mankind at this 
point. After murdering her ex-hus- 
band's new queen, father, and her 
own kids, Medea says something like 
"people go crazy when ihey think too 

Are we as a society capable of hav- 
ing and using Ihis vast scientific 
knowledge to the benefit of the world 
without going insane?

Dear AddI Louise. 

I jusi cannol seem lo gel maiivated for 
the seoicsler. I don't know why. It's jusl 
that right no* I am feeling really dried 
out lite nothing really mallets lo me. ya 
know. Or whenever I have lo do some- 
thing. I take Uic allitude of I'll do il when 
I gel aiound to it. 

Sincerely, 
Restless in Fort Wayne 
Dear Restless, 

Honey, what il stiiuids like lo me is thai 
you aie Irying lo recover (torn some type 
of depics.sioo. Now, darling, we all go 
through diis occa.^iunally. 1 hear Ihe holi- 



days arc really bad and depression runs 
lampanl because you don't have some- 
one lo snuggle wilh under a nice cozy 
blankcl looking in front of a warm flick- 
ering Hrc. 

Or maybe someone in your family has 
died, Il is quite hard to adjust to Ihc ab- 
sence of that person. Death around Ihe 
holidays is so traumatic. 

What you need to do is jusl slop and 
re-evaluate what you wani lo do wilh 
your life. This is a new year thai can be 
filled with a lol of wonderful things de- 
pending on what you want to do with ii. I 
am a strong tielievcr in New Year's reso- 
lutions. The time is righl now. So, do 
some self-evaluation, write oul a list of 
short and long lime goals, and ihen go 
for il. 

I wish you all of the luck. 
Your loviag AunI Louise 

Dear Aunt Louise, 

Well, il's Ihe new year and I have be- 
gun my own personal war against 
weight, I am going to make that change 
and lose those pounds. 1 am sick and 
lired of being undesirable and unaitrac- 



I only have one problem, my mind is 
siucli on losing weight but my laslc buds 
are stuck on eating McDonald's. 
Wendy's, Taco Bell or my favorite Just 
Ribs. I'm telling you, Auntie, you ain'l 
had no ribs unlil you have had Jusl Ribs. 

So, 1 want 10 know how I can lose my 
weight but slili eat my ribs. 

Sincerely, 
Finger lickin' good 
Dear Finger lickin' good, 

Now look, sugar! You can'l have your 
cake and eat il loo. You are going lo have 
to decide one away or another. Didn't 
you see Ihe Oprah Winfrey show where 
she lalked about losing weight? You 
know I jusl think the world about hei. 
She's so darling and I love her lo pieces. 
But, remember when missy went on Ihat 
first diel. My, she got so skinny she 
looked like a pop sickle stick. 

Anyway, you see she finally gained Ihc 
weight back. Well, one thing Miss Win- 
frey lalked about her wage against fal 
was the way she was Ihinkin'. And hon- 
ey, 1 don't think you're Ihinkin; like you 
wan! to lose the weight. So, you need lo 
decide ciiher men or Ihc ribs. 

Your loving Aunt Louise

The Communicator 



A tribute to Martin Luther King, jr. 



"There are those who ask 
the devotees of civil rights, 
'When will you be satis- 
fied?'..." 



"Human progress is neither 
automatic nor inevitable.... 
Every step toward the goal 
of justice requires sacrifice, 
suffering, and struggle; the 
tireless exertion and pas- 
sionate concern of dedicated 
individuals." 



"Violence ends by defeating 
itself. It creates bitterness in 
the survivors and brutality in 
the destroyers." 




"I believe thai even amid 
today's mortar bursts and 
whining bullets, there is still 
hope for a brighter tomorrow." 



"It would be fatal for the 
nation to overlook the urgency 
of the moment. This swelter- 
ing summer of the Negro's le- 
gitimate discontent will not 
pass until there Js an invigorat- 
ing autumn of freedom and 
equality." 



"When we allow freedom to 
ring, when we let it ring from 
every village and every ham- 
let, from every stale and every 
city, we will be able to speed 
up that day when all of God's 
children, black men and white 
men, Jews and Gentiles. 
Protestants and Catholics will 
be able to join hands and sing 
in the words of the old Negro 
spiritual, "Free at last! Free at 
last! Thank God almighty, we 
are free at last!"

Image of IPFW Mastodon mascot 
decorates roof of Woodburn barn 



Drive out lo Ihe farm of Lloyd and 
Vivian Ball, 3927 Morgan Rd.. 
Woodbum, Ind., and you'll sec whai 
nfiay be ihc largesi mastodon in 
Indiana. 
There, on the Balls' new bam roof, 
is (he image of a mastodon, about 
15 by 30 feci, created using colored 
shingles. The mastodon appears on 
both sides of Ihe root. 

Why shingle Ihe roof with an ex- 
tinct mammal? Well, that mammal 
happens (o be Ihc mascot of Indiana 
University-Purdue University Fort 
Wayne (IPFW). And the Balls' son, 
Arnie Ball, is Ihc coach of the na- 
tionally ranked men's volleyball 
team, the Mastodons (Volleydons). 
as well as IPFW director of intercol- 
legiate, intramural, and recreational 
programs. 

When Ihe Balls prepared lo pur- 
chase a new bam roof, their roofing 
contractor, Ron Bailey, of Shcrriff- 
Goslin Co. in Fori Wayne, asked if 
they'd like a custom design. 

Bailey, who knows about Arnie 
and his champion volleyball team, 
suggested that mastodon. Vivian 
Ball supplied the model for the de- 
sign, a stuH'ed toy mastodon that's 
currently being sold by the Royal 
Dons Club, a group of IPFW athlet- 
ics boosters. 

"Anything we can do to help pro- 
mote the university and the athletics 
programs, we'llTJo,' Vivian Ball 
said. 

The rooting job was completed in 
early November after about three 
weeks. Already Bailey has taken 
photographs to help advertise his 
custom roofing designs. 




Meanwhile, the Balls have been 
amused at the neighbors' curiosity. 

"So far, our neighbors have 
guessed that it's an elephant or a 
buffalo," Vivian Ball said. 

The mastodon was selected in 
1969 as official university mascot 
after a student vote failed to indicate 
a favored choice. Student govern- 
ment leaders look matters into their 
own hands by forming a committee, 
voting almost unanimously to select 
the mastodon, and taking new re- 
leases to local media outlets. 

The resulting story went out over 
the national wire services, resulting 
in a long stream of clippings. 

The idea began in 1968 after bones 



were found on a fami near Angola. 
Ind. Ofcie Routsong, Sr., and a 
neighbor boy came upon some large 
leg and rib bones while excavating a 
swampy area to make a fish pond. 
Some of those bones arc on perma- 
nent loan to IPFW and are on view 
in a display case in Kcttler Hall. 

Periodically, when college mascots 
are ranked for their uniqueness, the 
IPFW mastodon always lands in the 
top ten.

Lady Dons win tournament 



Most schools plan on winning Iheir 
own toumaraenis, but IPRV knew il 
would have to play hard to claim thai 
lille Ihat year. The problem probably 
would not be St. Francis (IL). whom 
Ihe Lady Dons defeated 74-41 in Ihe 
first round on Friday, but Ihe possible 
match-up with undefeated Mankato 
Slate (MN). 

That game did lake place in the 



championship as Mankato dropped 
lUPUI, 99-65, to advance- IPFW 
would be in control for ihe enlire 
contest, losing the lead lo Mankato 
for a brief moment early in ihe sec- 
ond half, before pulling away lo 
claim Ihe 75-64 championship viclo- 

ry- 

Michelle Conley. who had averaged 
less than 10 minules playing time pri- 



or lo that game, led IPFW with 22 
points and 13 rebounds, while Jennie 
Newhard continued her solid season
