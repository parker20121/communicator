interviewing candidates for the 
position this upcoming month. 
Once selected, this officer 
would report affirmative action

The IPSGA also discussed a

IU Trustees President Fred

President of Harvard wrong in gender-based statements 



Lawrence Summers, the president of Harvard 
University, incited fervor when he raised the idea 
that women are reluctant to spend the time and work 
necessary to succeed in the science and engineering 
fields. Furthermore, he contended that women are 
prevented from success by an innate aversion toward 
these fields; at least, this was Summers's claim at a Ian. 
c conference on diversity. 

Summers has since apologized three 
;s for these remarks, but lie defended the 
t by maintaining that it was intended to pro- 
voke active dialogue on this issue. By that measure- 
ment, he may consider his speech a success. 

Women at universities across the nation are respond- 
ing to Summers's observations. Kristina M. Johnson, 
the first female head of Duke University's Pratt School 
of Engineering, rinds Summers's ideas counterpro- 
ductive to the future of the science and engineering 
disciplines. "We should be concentrating on what we 



can do to encourage them (women) to become engi- 
neers and scientists." she said. "Unless we bring more 
women and minorities into science and engineering 
fields, we will not have the intellectual capital to com- 
pete in the global marketplace to address the major 
economic, environmental, health and security issues 
facing our nation in the decades ahead." 

According to data from the National Science board 
(in 2000), male engineers earn an average of $2,000 
more than women after the first five years of earning 
their degree. The trend persists as seniority increases, 
until female engineers plateau at $60,000 (after 15 to 
19 years from when they earned their degrees); how- 
ever, their male counterparts' salaries continue to 
grow unabated. 

At Purdue University, only three of the 13 listed 
members of the Department of Engineering Education 
faculty are women, and in Indiana University's 
Department of Chemistry, women comprise five of 



the 38 faculty positions. 

Is it necessary for us to explain to Summers why 
women aren't equally represented in these upper level 
science and engineering positions? The environment 
for learning these subjects is male-dominated and 
therefore alienating to women; discomfort is not con- 
ducive to learning. Assuming that a wor 
the necessary science, math and engineering c 
arid earns a degree, she has more of this male-centric 
atmosphere to look forward to in the workplace, 

Women like Johnson provide the role models whom 
young women need in order to persevere in the science 
fields. Dartmouth physics professor Mary Hudson 
provides another example of this sort of leadership. 
Fortunately for these disciplines, Hudson doesn't fore- 
see Summers's remarks as ultimately deterring women 
who want to pursue science and/or engineering at the 
collegiate level; these women just may be disinclined 
to pursue them at Harvard.

Good riddance Fidel, sayonara Kim Jong-ll 



Staff Column 

By Nick Young 



A thought crossed my mind while 
listening to Swedish death metal. Unlike 
most thoughts that just randomly lose their 
way inside my skull and then find their way 
out just as quickly, this one stayed for an 
indeterminate period. I'm nebulous on 
the length only because I didn't activate my 
Power Rangers wristwatch upon immedi- 
ate knowledge of said idea. 

I can sense that you're all waiting with 
baited breath for my brilliant brainstorm, 
so here it is: let's preemptively invade a few 

eignty all to pieces. What a great idea. 

Now, I know what you're all think- 
ing. "Why would we want to go and have a 
war on multiple fronts?" A good question, 
and I'm so glad you asked, because that is 
precisely NOT what I'm suggesting. We've 
already got Iraq and Afghanistan on our 
hands simultaneously we so do not need 
another batllefront. 

What I'm suggesting would take place 
a few more years down the road. Let's 
assume, for the sake of argument, that by 
the start of 2007 we've been able to pull 
the majority of our troops out of Iraq. Let's 
also factor into this assumption the idea 
that the situation in Afghanistan has been 
stabilized enough for us to play only a mere 
advisory role. (Yes, yes, I know these are 
assumptions, but they're fully within the 
realm of probability.) 

At this point in the game our military 
wouldn't be as bogged down as they are 
currently. As such, I think Feb. 14, 2007 
would be a good date to depose Fidel 
Castro and make Cuba an actual democra- 
cy. Nothing says "I love you" like an 1CBM 
to a presidential palace. And boy-oh-boy 
would he deserve it. 

Why? Because 1 hate his beard, that's 
why. But seriously... 

Let's actually be honest with ourselves 
for once: the whole world knows thai Castro 



is a waste of a human being. Those who order to get his hands on nuclear weapons 

thinkotherwiselost their sctisu of fraternity to build a bigger, better, badder army,

Johnny Carson changed comedy and life 

Vance's Views 

By Dan Vance 



Former nighttime talk show host 
Johnny Carson died this past weekend at 

Long before there was Jay. Leno, Da- 
vid Letterman and Conan O'Brien, parson 
ruled the late night scene. Actually, he did 






In a time where television was nothing 
more than a revolving carousel of the same 
boring shows, he was the first man to step 
out of the box and try something different. 
And admittedly, most of Carson's material 
would not have worked for anyone else. 
But it worked for him. 

Carson took over "The Tonight Show" 
in 1962 and quickly shied away from the 
dull approach that almost every talk show 
host had used. Instead, the budding come- 
dian let his true side, not his news side, be

still unknown to probably half of his vie 
To be the man who changes televisl 



is a huge accomplishment. But to be the 
man who changes life is even bigger. 

Most of us college age students were 
still in the single digit age bracket when 
Carspn retired in 1992. So for many of us, 
he is nothing more than a name in the an- 
nuls of time and a VHS tape on our grand- 
mother's shelf. 

But to see his impact, you don't have 
to look much further than the comedians 
of today. If it were not for Johnny Carson, 
who knows where they would be at this 
point in their lives. He had a broad range 
of comedic styltngs from slaphappy to 
mature adult humor; Carson was the man 
whom everyone else must use to gauge his 
or her talents. He was and still is the scale 
that they all use. 

"On Late Night with Conan O'Brein," 
O'Brien uses many of the same antics to- 
day that Carson used over the course of 
four decades. To watch a tape of Carson, 
then flip to NBC and watch O'Brien, it is 



almost like a dedication to one of the true 
television legends. 

And if it wasn't how he conducted 
himself that inspired the artists of today, it 
was the opportunities that he gave them. 
Letterman, Joan Rivers and George Carlin 
(to name a few) ail got their big break on 
"The Tonight Show." It was his benevolence 
to those people that showed yet another

• He lived a "do unto others as you 
would have others do unto you" lifestyle. 
That much is obvious to me just hearing 
stories about the man over the past couple 
of days on virtually every news channel 
and morning show. He was loved for what 
he did and how he did it. 

He opened a lot of doors when he 
was on the air. And when he left in 1992, he 
never shut them. Instead, he left the oppor- 
tiiint\ t here for all generations.

I'm not one of those women

don't wear those sweatshirts 
with ironed-on or airbrushed 
photos of my cat. In fact. I don't 
even really have a cat. 

For the past four or five 
months (since Aug. 19), I've 
been caring for my friend's 
cat while he transitions from 
one living situation to another. 
Before this cat came to live with 
us, my family had gone almost 
two years (one year, nine 
months and 14 days) without 

I had gradually become 
unaware of the feline deficit In 
our lives, but it continued to 
grow despite my Ignorance of 
it. I knew I was lonely, but I hud 
been lonely for so long diat I 
had begun not to notice it. 

By the time "Tom Ridge"— 
I'll call him by my nickname 
for him to protect his Identity- 
arrived, I knew we were desper- 
ate, but I wasn't prepared to 
confront the deficit that living 
without a cat had created in 
our lives. I expected that we 
would like having a cat around 
again, that we might fuss over 
him a little too much and that 
my friend might have a difficult 
time de-spoiling him once he 
got him back. But the fools we 
made of ourselves over this cat? 
That, I could not have antici- 

The poor animal was treated 
like whiskey at an AA meet-

part of our brains, we knew 
we should make some kind of

I first became disturbed by 
our behavior when one night 
at dinner, my sister discovered 
a piece of fur in her mashed 
potatoes. "Aww," she said. 
"How sweet." And so I began

I assumed that the novelty 
of having Tom Ridge around 
would eventually wear off, and 
in some ways, it has. We no 
longer gather around his water

about the litter box. We do still 
sit around him in a circle when 
he bathes himself, but that's 
only because of his unique style. 
He makes the task much harder

Snow not big deal like meterologists say 



Staff Columnist 



Is anybody else tired of the Fort Wayne 
meteorologists and weathercasters over- 
torecasting snowstorms? 

They said wc would get eight to ten 
inches of snow Friday night and Saturday, 
and we got five inches. 

For days we heard about this big, bad 
winter storm that "walloped" the Midwest 
and was heading our way to bury us waist- 
high in the white stuff. WANE TV's Sandy 
Thompson pointed and clucked the word 
"here" about 600 times regarding the soon- 
to-be-snow-covered northeast Indiana. 
Curtis Smith's face told us not to drive and 
to use extra caution if we had to drive at 
all. Greg Shoup used super-cool radar and 
computer technology to show us how crazy 
Friday night and Saturday would be. The 
Journal Gazette's headline quizzed "Will 
snow be this deep today?" with a 10-inch 
ruler graphic running next to it. 

It is the same story every year. A big 
winter storm is heading our way and local 
meteorologists over- forecast, the media 
overreacts and the public freaks out. 

Quick! Send reporters out in the field 
to ask Home Depot supervisors if they 
will have enough snow shovels and salt in 
stock. Tell viewers and readers to stay off of 
the roads unless they have an emergency. 
And make sure we have enough warnings 
and graphics on the television screen so 
people can't see the score of the game or 
half of Jay Leno's body. 

I was out in Fort Wayne all day Friday 
with my girlfriend and most everywhere 



we went seemed busy. I chalked it up to 
a typical Friday with citizens out enjoying 
their freshly earned paychecks. She and I 
went to Meijer around 3 p.m. to do some 
previously planned grocery shopping. I 
walked in and grabbed one of about only 10 
shopping carts. A very low amount indeed, 
but hey, it was Friday. 

As I was dodging old people and soccer 
moms with the cart, I realized this was not 
a typical busy day. My "excuse me" turned 
into "umm, I'm sorry, I guess I'm not mov- 
ing fast enough" as people kept bumping 
into me and cutting me off. The milk arid 
bread sections were stocked, but people 
were clustered around them and the sup- 
plies appeared to be going quickly. 

We got up to the checkouts and each 
line was probably five or six cans deep, 
no lie. After a 15-minute wait, we finally 
reached the cash register and my girlfriend 
started up a conversation with the cashier. 
"Busy day today," she said. 

"Yeah, people are stocking up for the 
snowstorm," the cashier responded. 

Aw, snaps! It dawned on me. Sandy 
Thompson had gone and done it again. Tsk, 
tsk Curtis. Shame on you, Mr. Shoup. You've 
got Fort Wayne running around like freshly 
beheaded chickens with another one of 

As I was walking out of Meijer and 
watching the cart-pushers struggling to 
keep up with the customer flow, I asked 
myself a few questions. 

"Why does snow make Hoosiers buy 



enough supplies to last as if they lived dur- 
ing the early parts of the Cold War? Is your 
bomb cellar full of canned food and bottled 
water, Mrs. Doe?" 

It's not like the snow isn't going to be 
plowed within a few hours or melt away 
within a few days. 

"Why is milk the first thing off of the 
shelf when it is the first to spoil after meat 
if power is lost?" 

"Why do local media people make such 
a big deal about snow, leading off the five, 
six and 11 o'clock news with five-minute 
overviews of the situation and then the five 
regular minutes later in the newscast?" 

You have to wonder why the local weath- 
ercasters predict such a large amount of 
snow that never really shows up. I'm sure 
they can't be that dumb or the weather that 
unpredictable or take that much pleasure 
in knowing thousands of people are buy- 
ing hundreds of dollars worth of supplies 
based on their forecast. 

Is it the "better safe than sorry" ideol- 
ogy? Because predicting 1 and getting five 
is better than predicting five and getting 
10? I don't like that. That is inaccurate and 
goes against journalistic integrity. I don't 
think Fort Wayne media and its meteorolo- 
gists would stoop to that level. 

Whatever the case, I asked myself a few 
more questions when I woke up Saturday 
morning and peeked through the blinds. 

"Where is the eight to 10?" and "Why 
does anybody listen to the local meteorolo- 
gists anymore?"

It all started with a guitar. And eBay. Or did il start with 
an eye for detail? A love of music'! 1 Or ,i high school crush? 

The once-in-a-lifetime story be- 
hind Matt Kelleys success as a graph- 
ic artist spins a fine web through time. 
From Bob Dylan to the Smithsonian 
and all the places in between, it all has 
to do with a lucky instrument, hence 
the name of Kelleys idea house, One 
Lucky Guitar. 

Bucky Baxter, a steel string gui- 
tar player for Bob Dylan throughout 
the 1990s, was selling various instru- 
ments through eBay, and Kelley won 

fashion," and appropriated a guitar through Baxter's 

ager, who after a long and personable phoi 

recalled some time later that Kelley dabbled in graphic 

design. Soon he was asked to commission some work for 

Baxter himself and the snowball started to roll. Kelley met 

HaMer. jumped nn the creative team behind then 

studio, and got a phone call from a gid 

chased for 10 years. Future Mrs. Matt 

Kelley finally asked, "Are you ready 

to finally go on a date?" 

When he was younger, r 
sic lover Kelley would listen 
to recordings and ogle the 
cover art of the 
thinking quietly to hir 
self, "This is what I \ 
to do." And it was growing 
up with roots. Americana, 
and rock tunes that gave 
Kelley his style, 
cally and artistically.

The vintage canvas on which most of OLG's 
work is found is nothing like the synthetic, wannabe- 
retro fad that produces messy trucker hats and $60 faded 
jeans with ratty holes. While a favored style, Kelley knows 
iality of vintage is lessening its authentic, ar- 




tistic impact. "I'm always wondering what's next," he said. 
"The first to take a challenge, the last to turn out the 
lights," is an ample tagline found on OLG's website (on- 
eluckyguitar.com). In fact, the site brims with an earthy, 
witty personality. It isn't shiny or flashy, but genial and 
conversational, boasting personal empowerment and the 
desire "to make decisions, shake up Goliaths" and feel 

Kelley speaks with a low. electric drawl, a smile wait- 
ing in the wings behind a red. unshaven beard. The spirit 
of an excited college kid shows through in his eyes, but his 
expression reads quiet amusement and contentment. 

As Kelley sits in his office cradling a coffee cup, he 
seems surrounded by this very contentment, which has 
come with the satisfaction of realizing dreams, finding 
and having a cool little part of the world to call his 
fice, shared by fellow artist Josh Von- 
decorated with pieces of their work: 
labels, designs, CDs, photographs 
haye-you. Kelley is a serious family 
through and through. He doesn't say it, 
clear in his surroundings, with his web-

pleted the album art for John 
Minton, Professor of Folklore at 
IPFW. Matt fell in love with the 
album, sharing that "Everything 
we do, we're doing at 1 10 per- 
cent anyway, but this | album I 
was a labor of love." 

Many of the creations put 
itit by OLG are borne of hard won 
ruit, infused with laborious pas- 
sion and acute interest in the task at 
hand. If luck has anything to do with it, it 
may only be the icing on the cake for Kelley 
and his company.

The marriage of cash and Java 



An unlikely pair 
matched together, 
allowing you to 
withdraw from 
your account while 
sipping a latte 

By Dan Vance 



A new coffee house trend is 
beginning here in Fort Wayne. 

Starting next week, Market 
Bank will open the doors of its 
first Fort Wayne location. 

But once inside, the average 
customer will learn that this is 
not your ordinary bank. 

While the front will be lined 
with your traditional tellers 
and bank staff, one thing will 
stand out like a sore thumb: 
BeanCounterS. a new in-bank 
cafe" run by Dave Bennett will 
be the first of it's kind to open 
in the city. 

Bennett, who owns and op- 
erates Naked Clay Cafe\ was 
put in touch with the bank by 
one of his customers. Markel. 
who have several banks 
around the area, wanted to in- 
clude a caf&lt;* in their new Fort 
Wayne location to capitalize 
on the growing success of the 
trend in other areas, including 
Indianapolis, where it was re- 
cently introduced. 

"It Ithe bank| was always 
designed with a cafe in mind," 

Bennett. "It in part is pull 
people back into banks and 




away from online banking." 

The idea, originated from 
Markel bank operators, is 
planned to go hand in hand 
with the bank's marketing 
plan to bring a hometown feel 
back to hometown banking. 

"There is a trend with 
banks to doing more custom- 
er friendly tilings just trying 
to bring people in." said Ben- 



that 
type 

of things, from a full espresso 
menu, to muffins and cold 
drinks, wilt be available. 

The bank-cafe" will also 
have wireless Internet capa- 
bilities, a couple of computer 
stations and a fireplace for 



those in need of a relaxing 

Also on the side of the 
Markel Bank/ BeanCounterS 
venture is the fact that it is the ' 
first one in Fort Wayne and it's ! 
surrounding area. "It is diffi- 
cult for current banks to put a ' 
cafe," Bennett mentioned. 

We are going to do it right, 
so you have to have a newly j 
built bank designed for it. 

The final steps with the | 
design and layout are being j 
worked out this week, with i 
theopeningofthecafesched- 
uled for next week, as early as i 
Monday. 

Markel Bank's first Fort I 
Wayne location is located on j 
Jefferson Blvd.. just west of I 
Covington Plaza and next to ! 
Duncan Donuts.

With only right games Ich in the regular sr.i 
son, the women's basketball team finds themselves 
snuggling with ;i 2-14 record. 

While on tin- surface, ii would seem that there 
Is nothing to smile ahum, let's remember that a re- 
cord doesn't reflet i every struggle, improvement or 
minor sin cess thai the le.nn might experience. 

Nobody, Including these hard-working play- 
ers, wants to hear excuses on the team's behalf, 
However, there ore some extenuating factors to 
take Into account 

One of the most detrimental factors to this 
(cam's success is the sudden l.ick of college level 
experience. Of the 14 players on the active rosier, 
niily live of I hem have more than one year of expe- 
rience prior lo this season. 

It's basically a brand new team wilh the loss of 
lust year's leading scorer Amy Gearlds. 

The good news Is thai there are four new 
freshmen getting more chances fo play and Im- 
prove than (hey would have playing under a pri- 
marily senior based team. 

Llndsey Haver, Sarah dlnwack and Inhnna 
Lewis- Carlisle have shown a lot of promise early in 
their college campaign, 

Executive Head Coach Chris I'aul says that 
although t-oulsvillc backed off recruiting luhnna- 
U-wis Carlisle doe to her smaller sine, her speed has 
helped her beat up on many defenders this year 

From the looks ol her play Head Coach Bruce 
Patterson might want to send I oiusville's scouts a 
thank you card and a bottle of Mylanla. 

"She (Carlisle) has the ability to he very .spc- 



from her time In Freeland, Michigan 
he playing with a lot ol confidence. 

She also has the ability to be effective from the 
point guard or the two guard position. 

Of course, in a perfect world, these young 
players could be eased into the Division I level of 
Tifortable pace. However, in the

s art; to improve as.a team while

"These young kids have a lot to bring and we 
look forward to improving as a team," said Nelson. 

The team also is happy to have Hilary 
O'Comiell hack from being medically red-shirted 
last season. O'Connell brings excellent ball con- 
trol, steady free throw accuracy and some added 
threat from behind the arc. 

Another athlete with a ton of potential is 
sophomore Ashley "A.| " Johnson, who is the team's 
leading scorer with 171 points on the season. A.J. 
has also racked up J't assists which is almost a ie, an 
high second only to Molly Martin (31). 

The coaching stall can see Johnson hei inning 
one of the next leadeisoi ihis growing team. 

"This is a kid who Is returning as a player and 
has been forced to step into a leadership role She- 
works hard at practice and has been consistent in 
every game this season." said Nelson. 

We will also, in all likelihood, see two career 
milestones reached this year by the soon lo be de- 
parting seniors. 

Courtney Nicley is only 68 points away from 
the same 1 ,000 career points that men's basketball 
senior David Simon was recognized for a couple 
short weeks ago. 

Verea Bibbs has already surpassed the 500 ca- 
reer rebound mark with 545 and counting. 

So why, with all this talent, has this team strug- 
gled:' It all comes down to (he youth of the team. 
Confidence is noi something that comes for free 
and these women had to earn it this season. Ben

:r the past couple weeks. 

"If you walked into pracuce. you would think 

(hey were 13-2 because they bring it everyday. 

Their attitude, workcihn and locus are very good/' 

Although Bibbs and Nicley are gone after this 
season, (he coaches feel thai there are going to be- 
plenty of players to step up and help this (earn Im-

IPFW got off lo its season 
high six-game road trip on a sour 
note last week, dropping games 
to Kent St. last Monday and Utah 
Valley St. last Saturday. 

In Monday's game, which the 
Mastodons lost 81-72, turnovers 
were what cost IPFW a chance at 
the win. The Mastodons turned 
the ball over 24 times in the game, 
leading to several uncontested 
layups for the Golden Flashes. 
Senior center David Simon got in 
foul trouble early in the game, so 
IPFW had to rely on the perimeter

"QC played really well defen- 
sively," Bauer said. "He did a great 
job [on Price), but some shots he 
got were just incredible." 

IPFW got the game to within 
five with 5:30 left in the game, but 
a 16-2 Wolverine run quickly put 
the game out of reach. 

The Mastodons were led by 
Simon's 17 points,. The only other 
IPFW player to finish in double- 
figures was junior Quintin Butler, 
who finished with 11. 

"The inside defense on us 
was not as good as it has been in 
earlier games and Dave and Quin-
