Students' Government to 
tackle parking fee problem 



BY TIM DUCEY 

AND 
MARKFRANKE 



week began tackling the problem of 
parking fees on campus. Brock Able, 
Student Body President, contacted 
last week concerning parking fees, 
commented, "Since this is a 
commuter campus with no dormitor- 
ies, why should anyone forced to drive 
be compelled to pay parking fees?" 
able continued, "Student Govern- 
ment will do their part to see that 
parking fees are eliminated." 

The parking fee situation has 
been a major cause for concern since 
its inception in 1970. Controversy still 



e plan's origin. One 



wishes to remai: 
"Paid parking was a foregone con- 
clusion by Purdue University in 
Lafayette before we started our work 
Purdue- Lafayette 
i line with other 
regional campuses." 

Ralph E. Broyles, chancellor of 
the Indiana sector of Indiana-Purdue, 
was involved in the 1970 decision to 
initiate the present fee. When asked if 
he considered the parking fee a 
conclusion before he gave 



decision, but one that had to be made 
to solve the parking problem. 

Just what ideas and plans went 
into the decision to create a parking 
fee, and for what reasons? 

This information was provided by 
Roger J. Manges, dean and director 
of Purdue operations. Dean Manges 
served as chairman of the Joint 
Parking and Traffic Advisory Com- 
mittee from the time of its inception 
until the committee completed work 
on March 2, 1970. 

This committee was formed on 
November 28, 1969, by Broyles and L. 
0. Nelson, former dean and director 
of Purdue operations here, for the 
express purpose of studying the 
parking needs at IU-PU for a ten-year 
period, and recommending feasible 
solutions to those needs. 

At the time of creation the 
committee was faced with the task of 
increasing on-campus parking from 
the 1,981 spaces available in 1969 to 
the projected total of 4,721 spaces by 
1980. They had to do so with the 
knowledge that the state would not 
provide money for parking facilities 
on campus. 

, chaired by Man- 



Linda Balthaser, H. William Davies, 
Robert L. Dean, Donald F. Grote, 
Dwight Henderson, Rue C. Johnson, 
Kenneth L. Keller, Phillip A. Kennell, 



These eighteen individuals were 
directly responsible for the final 
recommendations of the JPAC, which 
were eventuially implemented after 
approval by Chancellor Broyles and 
Dean Nelson. A subcommittee was 
formed for the purpose of generating 
pertinent material for the approval of 
the full committee. This subcommit- 
tee included Professor Abbott, Ain- 
lay, McComb, Dr. Schottenstein, Miss 
Tonsing, and Manges. 

The committee conducted a , 
thorough investigation into the park- 
ing situation. They examined alter- 
native plans: l. No additional 
facilities. 2. Restrict the number of 
parking permits issued. 3. Restrict 
enrollment. 4. Finance from the 
operating budget. 5. Private 
enterprise. 6. Self-supporting 
parking program. 7. Fund drive. 8. 
Development of facilities in collabor- 
ation with the county. 

Each of these alternatives was 
examined in elaborate detail. 
Alternative financing from the oper- 
ating budget was recommended as a 
temporary solution for immediate 
space requirements, until a self-suf- 
ficient fund could be developed. 
Alternative No. 5, using a private 
concern for development of parking 
facilities, was discarded as more

The report, tilled "Governance of 
Multicampus Universities in Three 
Regions of Indiana: A Problem in 
Political Science," and authored by 



University of Illinois, was commis- 
sioned by the Indiana Commission for 
Higher Education. Their purpose was

In two of the areas of study, the 
Fort Wayne and Indianapolis cam- 
puses, the "Keenan Report" suggests 
complete independence for new state 
institutions. The third area of study, 
Northwest Indiana, was considered 
capable of maintaining its current 
pattern of administration. 

Professor Keenan, in his study of 
the Fort Wayne Indiana-Purdue 
campus, listed his recommendations 
to the commission as follows 
"Managerial Ideal: Complete inde- 
pendence for a new state institution. 
Tolerable alternatives: 1. Transfer 
of complete responsibility for the 
campus to Purdue University. 2. A 
single administrator, reporting to the

pattern. 4. Other alternatives.

arrangement, his tolerable alterna- 
tives and his unacceptable options,

which are sure to bring cries of 
protest. 

Keenan sees the situations at the 
Fort Wayne and Indianapolis cam- 
puses as critical, and calls for 
immediate action by the commission 
in both areas. In his report, Keenan 
notes, "This task of separating 
'intra-institutional' problems from 
'inter-institutional' ones is almost 
impossible in the case of Fort Wayne. 
Overwhelming the whole setting, for 
the most part, is the friction resulting 
from having two administrative 
and the division of acade- 



leaders of Fort Wayne who feel the 
present plan is working weel, Keenan 
had this comment, "I would point out 
that not a single staff member or 
faculty member, of the scores with 
whom I talked and corresponded, 
wished to retain the status quo." 

Professor Keenan, in concluding 
his study of the Fort Wayne campus, 
states, "The case appears to have 
been made that governance complex- 
ities are indeed affecting the quality 
of educational offerings in Allen 
County." 

The Keenan report is currently 
being studied by the local administra- 
tion, and local officials have no 

Action by the Commission for 
Higher Education is expected on the 
Keenan Report in the near future.

Hiding something, Manges? 

A discussion of student money and how it will be spent ended up where it usually 
does, in secret session, last Monday, October 8. 

The occasion was a meeting of the sub-committee of the .loinl Parking and Traf- 
fic Advisory Committee, which was meeting to discuss .mil formulate new plans 
for a possible fee reduction for on-campus parking. This sub-committee was 
formed to make recommendations to the full .IPAC, which passes it's recommen- 
dations on to the Chancellor of Indiana and (he Dean and Director of Purdue for 
their final decision on the mailer. 

A reporter for the Communicator was excluded by the chairman of the sub- 
committee, Thomas K. Scott, and that decision was upheld hy linger J. Manges, 
dean and director of Purdue. 

We ask, why? Is it the function of the administration of this campus lo promote 
secrecy when discussing student and l.icultv money'' We w.udd eei 1.1 inly hope not. 

This sub-committee is discussing an issue thai affecls every person on this cam- 
pus, and any plan they forward 10 the full committee should be openly and freely 
discussed, before any decision is made on the issue of parking fees. 

More importantly, the same free discussion should he the rule on any committee 
or sub-committee meeting on this campus. 

A secret meeting implies there is something lo hide In tins particular case, the

Kennnn report good 

The long-awaited report hv Dr. Boyd Kcnnan lo the Indiana Commission for 
Higher Education has been made public. We find many of itsstatcments pleasantly [""^ '^'^ ^"' m '' ^7,^1' Vm"'' ' 
surprising. 

Dr. Kennan "hit the nail on the head" when he analyzed IU-PU's problem as one Today in our country, I have said ov 

of an intollerable administrative structure. I he presence of two administrations on and over, we are in great danger, and 
campus has produced the expected results, lack of decision-nuking responsibility would hope thai (he day comes when yi 
and beggar-my-neighbor attitudes toward each other. wi " understand what I have been irying 

He also showed considerable insight when he assessed i he relationship of IU-PU you ' 

to the parent campuses as one of tight central control and almost no autonomy. 

But mosl pleasant of all his statements was the recommendation he made . 

concerning the future of IU-PU. In no uncertain terms he called for the complete CflVeOt imperGtoH 
separation of IU-PU from Dloommgton and Lafayette. 

This paper endorses strongly his recommendation for complete independence as 
an ideal alternative. Bul we qualify this endorsement, much as Dr. Kennan did his, 
with recognition of the cold, hard political facts. Neither university is likely to 
"give up" its Fort Wayne campus without a fight. 

As a second, but less attractive alternative, we supporl his suggestion number 
three: an autonomous campus with a super-chancellor reporting directly to both 
presidents. 

It is our hope that Dr. Kcnnan's insights and recommendations arc given due 
consideration by the Commission, and that resolution of our problem comes quic- 
kly.

Children held so closely to their parents' 
c'oaitails are shy, slow to develop, and sim- 
ply cannot play happily with other 
children. As far as I know, every study of 
day care centers in which there is adequate 
supervision, a caring attitude, sufficient 
opportunity for play, and experienced 
personnel (as is certainly the case at the 
IU-PU center) has shown that children 
thrive in such situations. To be an ade- 
quate parent involves much more than 
babysitting a child 24 hours a day; surely, 



whose husband has 

institutionalized vegetable for years, 
another aunt whose husband was killed in 
a construction accident. Despite a long-

a 61-yr,-old woman whose legs aren't 
shapely? My education is my life in- 
surance, life for my children and for 
myself. 1 know of no guarantee that will 
replace the husband with the good income. 
In addition, some facts should be noted. 
The maximum number of hours a child 
can be left at the daycare center is 20 hours 
a week. No meals are served at the center. 
Most of the children taken to the center 
stay there only a couple of hours a day, a 
few days a week. Both thechildrenand the 
mothers find it a rewarding experience. 
My congratulations to the people who 
promoted the idea and my appreciation to 
the people who are doing an outstanding 
job in staffing the center.

I hid 



together during a major air-ground 
skirmuish of the Golan Heights. The 
Syrians had attacked the high plateau oc- 
cupied by Israel and the Israelis were 
defeating them handily. 



However, ai the time one could n'l help 
but sympathize with Israel. The Golan 
Heights overlooked beautiful Galilee 
Valley and had been for years Ihc laun- 
ching site for Syrian artillery fire at Israeli 
villagers below and fisherman working the

Now, however, Israel is finding woi

A threat of this type is wrong, just as the 
interception of a civilian airliner is wrong, 
just as Arab hijacking and bombing of El

is Israel's toughening attitude on

A case can be made easily for Israeli 
retention of the Golan Heights. 
This area is vital to Israeli peace and 



around Jerusalem. The Israelis should 
have enough of the city for their national 
capital and to permit access to the Western 
Wall (Wailing Wall) which was denied to 
them before the Six-Day War. But, there 
arc Arab lands and Arab (Christian) 
religious shrines that should be free of 
Israeli domination — Bethlehem, the Way 
of the Cross in the walled city and others 
closer to Jordan. 



Most of the people of the world would 
like to retain a high degree of respect for 
Israel's accomplishments and a high 
degree of concern for its problems. The 
arrogance of the Israeli government is 
making this increasingly difficult. And this 
state of affairs has nothing to do with

Abortion victims eulogized 



By AUDREY GELLIS

who died inhumanely by the horrors of 
illegal abortion, martyrs to barbaric laws 
— for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

an ecumenical service held by the National 
Organization for Women (NOW) for all 
the women who have ever died from illegal

Anita Murray, coordinator of the

eulogized the dead women. "You died 
alone and unknown, in back alleys and on 
kitchen tables tortured with coat hangars 
and knitting needles, frozen catheters and 

full-strength lysol You were butchered 

and sacrificed under laws that falsely 
claimed to save life. . . -"

a special Catholic service for the martyred 
dead. On behalf of Jewish women, 1 read

mourning, adding: ". . . these, our dead 






Pat Fogarty McQuillan founded 
"Catholics for the Elimination of All Res- 
tictive Abortion Laws" in response to Buc- 
kley's actions and at the request of 
Catholics who object to the Catholic 
hierarchy's intervention into what they 
feel is a purely personal matter. To date, 
there are already 1,000 members of whom 
one-third are men (For more information, 
write Ms. McQuillan at 240 East 76th St., . 
New York. N.Y. 10021.) 

Ms. McQuillan "why didn't Jesus say 
something about it? He never uttered one 
word about abortion or contraception. 

"Nor does the Old Testament condemn 
abortion even though it's been practiced 
since the earliest days of recorded history." 

Ms. McQuillan cited some of the early 
methods of abortion: sponges, herbs, 
crude catheters. (Ultra-orthodox rabbis 

have allied with the Catholic hierarchy to 
fight legalized abortion.) 

Ms. McQuillan blames the prohibitions 
misinterpreted the church's teachings to 



against abortion to the time when con- 
traception became effective and abortion 
safe. That was when Margaret Sanger was 
being thrown in jail for teaching about 
contraception, when the Comstock Law

Parking fees 

Continued from page 1 

expensive than a self-supporting 

program. A self-supporting program 



sion. This alternative was examined 
in depth, with four possible avenues of 
procedure: assessment per credit 
hour, a fee per vehicle, funding from 
activity-athletic fee, or mechanical 
devices. It was decided that a fee for 
each vehicle was the best alternative, 
using a scaled, fixed annual or 
semester vehicle fee, which is being 
used at present. 

Alternative No. 8, joint efforts 
with the county, was considered a 
long-term possibility that required 
further research, and it still a 
possibility. Ail other alternatives 
were discarded as being too impracti- 
cal, unpopular or detrimental to a 
healthy enrollment growth. 

In reaching their final decisions 
on which procedure to recommend, it 
was necessary for the committee to 
consider the costs involved in any 
future space expansion, and the 
method of expanding. These costs 
were broken down as follows : 
'/ H . Ballast and Bumper (gravel, such 
as the 'B' lots) $125 a space, 
2. Asphalt, $350 a space; 3. 
Parking garages, $1,600 a space. 

It must be emphasized at this 
point that the cost-per-space estima- 
tes are figures from 1969 and reflect 
how dangerous it has become to make 
long-range cost estimates, in light of 
the tremendous jump in construction 
costs. Dean Manges made that point 
by showing that even if work was done 



Arthur Hansen, above, president o 
Purdue University at West Lafayette 
Indiana, spoke to faculty members o 
lndiano-Purdue University, Monday 
October 8. 



$600 a space; and Parking garage, 
$2,300 a space. These figures are 
approximate and could possibly be 









led to the present 
program, it was decided that a 
self-supporting parking fund should 
be accumulated, using the present 'A' 
AND 'B' permits with a breakdown of 
'A' assessment: $30 a semester, $60 a 
year for full tifae students; 'B' 
assessment: $12.50 a semester, $25 a 
year for full time students. 'A' 
permits were given spaces with 
closest proximity to buildings and 'B' 
permits the spaces in outlying lots. 
These assessments were determined 
with consideration for the possibility 
of constructing parking garages at 
some point in the ten-year period, 
beginning 1970, but were based on the 
out-dated 1969 



This sticker fee has been in effect 
since the 1970-71 school year. Since 
that time $462,777.79 has been collect- 
ed. Expenditures total $135,066,45, 
with a net balance of $327,711.25. 
This fund is a separate account, 
maintained strictly for parking, and 
by law cannot be used for any other 
project. The fund is under the control 
of the Chancellor of Indiana, Fort 
Wayne, and the Dean of Purdue, Fort 
Wayne. 

Of the monies collected so far, 
three catagories are a part of the 
sticker fees, parking meter 



The (all 1973 semester has produced 
the sale of 5,lli 1 sliekers in both the';,' 
and 'B' catagories, and includes 
full-time and part-time stickers, as 
well as all day and evening issues. 
These stickers are strictly main- 
tained by Safety and Security, with 
iron control over both the number 
issued and the number on hand. Any 
misprints or lost slickers are individ- 
ually accounted for. 

This lengthy explanation of the 
facts surrounding the parking pro- 
blem demonstrates that the decision 
to assess a parking fee was not an 
arbitrary one, but the result of 
painstaking examination of all altern- 
atives available. While some would 
disagree with the final solution, it 
remains unclear if there was. a better 
method of dealing with the parking 

of the almost-doubling 
, Dean Marines w.is 
asked if he still considered parking 
garages a feasible possibility. The 
Dean explained the the Joint Advisory 
PARKING Committee is studying 
that aspect of future parking, and he 
will wait for their recommendations 
before he and the Indiana Chancellor 
make any decisions. He went on to 
admit that the possibility of lower 
parking fees would also be given 
consideration by JPACif it is deter- 
mined that parking garages are not 
economically feasible. JPAC will 
study lower parking fees in its future 
meeting.

SPORTS 
SHOTS 



....This year professional hockey will undoubtedly (.«, 
popularity. The World Hockey Association will be ■ 
talent-wise, but will still be facing stiff money crises. 

The established NHL is losing some of its top names to the WHA. but 
at the same time is finding a wealth of new talent in American 
universities and Canadian junior hockey circuits. 

Herewith, then, are my picks for the 1973-74 NHL and WHA 
campaigns. 
NHL EAST 
1. Montreal Canadiens-Loss of Dryden may hurt but team depth is 



2. Boston Bruins-Bobby Orr is happy and healthy again. That means 
nothing but trouble for any foe. 

3. New York Rangers-New coach Popein is an unknown quantity. Team 
is balanced but not overpowering. 

4. Totonto Maple Leafs-Picked up Favell and Johnston to plug goal. Will 
battle Buffalo for fourth and final playoff spot. 

5 Buffalo Sabres-Improved defense is key. 

6. Detroit Red Wings-New coach is Ted Garvin, formerly of Port Huron 

of the IHL. Too many holes to fill. 

7 Vancouver Canucks-Great hockey town but low on talent. 

8. New York Islanders-Would have their hands full against the Fort 

Wavne Komets! 

NHL WEST 

Philidelphia Flyers-Exciting team headed by super Bobby Clark. 
Could be readv to jump the Black Hawks. 

2. Chicago Black Hawks-Still hold aces Stan Mikita, Dennis Hull, and 
Tony Esposito. But may not be hungry enough to stave off Flyers. 

3. Minnesota North Stars-Balanced squad capable to keeping pace with 
Chicago and Philly. 

4. Pittsburgh Penguins-Parent club of Fort Wayne Komets. Has 
potential but inexperience will keep them from threatening top three 
squads this year. 

5. St. Louis Blues-Always manage to make playoffs despite getting 
worse each year. Too many gaps this year to do any more than scramble 
for fourth. 

6. Los Angeles Kings-Improved defense will keep them in the running for 
the final playoff spot. 

7. Atlanta Flames-Surprising as first-year team but not playoff threat 

8. California Golden Seals-No fans and no talent.

"Andthenthereweretwo." After 
the third week of intramural flag 
football action, only two teams 
remained undefeated— SI onef ace and 
Smith. Last Sunday's action saw two 
shutouts while two teams could 
manage only safeties for their 
scoring. 

In a 1:30 contest, Circle K scored 
a safety with less than six minutes 
remaining to beat the Frosh 2-0 in a 
defensive battle. The fictorv moved 
Circle K's record to 2-1 while the 
Frosh dropped to 1-2.

Tom Neumann added one. Joe 
Clinkinbeard added the Tina) touch- 
down in the game. John Mc- 
Interr scored the safety to prevent the 
shutout. 

The 2:30 game was the battle of 
the unbeaten* between Brock Abie's 
Super Jocks and last year's cham- 
pions, Stoneface. 

The game was a hard-fought 

defensive struggle until Mike Stratton 
scored with only four minutes 
remaining to go ahead 6-0. The point 
after was unsuccessful, but the Super 
Jocks were unable to rally and 
dropped its mark to 2-1. 

Next Sunday's action will feature 
the Frosh against Smith in a 2:30 
contest. In the 1:30 games, Circle K 
will battle Stoneface while the

FIELD GOAL TAKES SPOTLIGHT 

The name of the game this year in the National Football League has 
been the field goal. Yes, those three pointers have played an important 
part in determining the standings each week. 

In the first week of action, it was Toni Fritsch's ll-yard field goal 
with less than one minute left that gave the Cowboys a 20-17 decision over 
the Bears. It was one of 32 three pointers during the week. 

In Miami's opening game win over the 49'ers, 12 of the Dolphins' 21 
points were the result of the foot of Garo Yapremian. 

Week two saw ageless George Blanda boot four field goals (all of 
Oakland's points) to help snap Miami's 17-game win streak. Who needs a 
quarterback? 

Pete Gogolak booted a 14-yarder as the gun sounded to help the New 
York Giants manage a 23-23 tie against the Eagles. It was a useless game 
because the Giants were supposed to win and yet the Eagles let an upset 

Also in week two, it was Jan Stenerud's 33-yard boot that gave the 
Chiefs a 10-7 victory over the Patriots. With 19 seconds remaining, 
Chester Marcol kicked a 24-yard field goal to help the Pack tie the Lions 
at 13. 

In the 49'ers' 36-34 win over the Broncos, Bruce Gossett kicked fiv e 
field goals. The final one came with just 26 seconds left to lift the 49'ers to 
the victory. 

Football's third week saw Don Cockroft kick four field goals»the last 
one with less than three minutes left in the game-to give the browns a 
12-10 decision over the Giants. . . John Leypoldt had three field goals to 
lead the Bills to a 9-7 win over the Jets. Fred Cox also had a trio in 
Minnesota's 11-3 win over the Packers. 

In last week's action, kicking specialist Chester Marcol kept the 
Packers hot on the tail of the Vikings with a 32 yarder with five seconds 
remaining to beat the Giants. It was Marcol's third of the game. 

Also, Buffalo's John Leypoldt helped the Bills to a 27-26 victory over 
Philadelphia with his kick of 47 yards late in the game. Tom Dempsey, 
who had kicked four three pointers earlier in the game, missed a 26 
yarder with only three seconds left in the contest. 

Jan Stenerud's 39-yard field goal with less than seven minutes left 
provided the margin of victory in the Chief's 16-14 decision over the 
unlucky Broncos. 

Some people are against the field goal, but what can be more exciting 
than a team, down by two points, trying a 49-yard field goal with only one 
second left in the game?
