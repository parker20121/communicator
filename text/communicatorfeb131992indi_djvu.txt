tions", Tschesnoloffs "Salvation is Created", and 
Russell Alexander's "Collossus of Columbia"

STATE OFFERS PLAN 
TO CLEAN HIGHWAYS 

Adopt-a-Highway will provide Hoosiers with an 
opportunity to clean up state roads, save money. 
show their commitment to a clean cnviromnent. and 
gain recognition, according to State Rep. Gloria 
Goeglein. 

In the spring, the Indiana Department of Trans- 
portation will expand the slate-wide Adopt-a-High- 
way program. 

"Over $1 million is spent on trash removal from 
our highways each year," Goeglein said. "But this 
amount is nowhere near enough to clean up all the 
roads. This volunteer program would allow the 
state to spend its money on other areas like road 
maintenance and construction." 

Goeglein said that Hoosiers will have the oppor- 
tunity to adopt a two-mile strip of highway. They 
will be responsible for cleaning up the trash at least 
four times per year for two years. As thanks, the 
groups' name will be highlighted on signs at both 
ends of the strip. 

For more information call (3 1 7) 232-5 1 1 5.

Activist speaks on 
hunger, homelessness 



By Mary Schrock 
Staff Writer 

Dirty, stupid welfare bums. 
Drugged-up minority derelicts. 
Mentally ill psychopaUis, These 
are the most common stereo- 
types of homeless people thai 
are used today, acording to 
Steve Haddad, spokesperson for 
The National Student Campaign 
Against Hunger and Homeless- 
ness. Haddad lectured at IPFW 
last Monday, about the problems 
and possible solutions of home- 
lessness. 

"The most stigmatizing condi- 
tion this nation has is being 
homeless," said Haddad. 

Across the nation the problem 
of homelessness is steadily 
increasing, but according to 
statistics the "People of the 
street" may not be who you 
think they are said Haddad. 

Women and children make up 
50 percent of the homeless 
population. Most are white. 
And roughly half of the home- 
less have full-lime jobs. 
according to Haddad. 

The National Student Cam- 



paign Against Hunger and 
Homelessness hopes to make a 
change not only in fhe way 
people look at the homeless but 
also in how people can get 
involved to make a difference. 

"Education is the most 
Important step. We 
need to get people 
involved first hand. " 
-Steve Haddad 

said Haddad. They do this by 
assisting individuals and groups 
in initialing local programs. 

"Education is the most impor- 
tant step. We need lo get peo- 
ple involved first hand," said 
Haddad. 

Haddad suggests a variety of 
activities that IPFW can sponsor 
lo draw people into an aware- 
ness of hunger and homeless- 
ness. By sponsoring sleep-outs, 
a slam dunk contest by the tras- 
keiball team and even a poeliy 
reading by the English depart- 
ment, ail of the divisions of the 
campus can get involved first 
hand, he said.

Union's Fireside Lounge. The 
film "takes a hard look at the 
way television news represents 
African-Americans," and "It 



provides a case study of how 
Ihe news gets made, what we 
see and what we don't see," 
according to a release provided

alive. 'This gives us a chance 
to refiect on die past Because if 
you don't know where you've 
been, its very difficult to know 
where to go," Poignard said. 

"It is also a dme for the larger 
culture to remember and for the 
younger ones to learn about 
some of die very positive con- 
tributions African-Americans 
have made lo this country," not- 
ed Poignard. "It's a time for 
everybody to just be more 
aware and develop a greate 
appreciation for each other." 

But ihai's not all, "Some of 
diese diings are a lot of fun. We 
try to do that, We uy to get a 
variety of Ihings," Poignard 
said. "We don't want to be so 
serious that we lose the element 
of having fun."

Slowing the descent of 
the homeless class 



li is impossible lo wish the homeless person 
you see on the sircei had a dcccnl place to live. 
Jn the United Stales there are "between 2-3 
million" homeless persons, according to Hous- 
ing Now. You could be wishing forever. 

If America is lo shrink its homeless popula- 
tion, a safely net has to be placed underneath 
its lower class. We must take a clear-eyed 
look at die risk factors that combine to put 
fKople out in the cold- 
Unemployment affects the homeless rate. 
Those unemployed during the 1980s were out 
of work for longer periods than in the past. 

Though unemployment rates declined in the 
middle of the decade, demand on emergency 
food and shelter sources stayed constant. 

Mental illness is another constant in the 
homeless population. From 1955 to 1980, the 
movement to lake the mentally ill from state 
institutions and place them in community-care 
centers reduced the state-hospital population 
by 75 percent, according lo Housing Now, a 
national housing righls advocacy group. Of 
the stale's projected 2,000 community-care 
centers, less than 800 were ever built, Thir 
meant that many of those released fall through 
the cracks of the existing health-care system. 

Often it only lakes a single personal crisis or 
catastrophe to render a person homeless. 
iDomestic violence, a house fire, or the death 
•of a spousc-lhese are just a few of them. 
'During the 80s. many, safety-net programs 
had their budgets sla.shed. Food stamps, wel- 
fare benefits, unemployment assistance were 
all significantly reduced by federal and stale 
governments. 

Drug and alcohol abuse continue to aggra- 
vate the situation. About 1/3 of the homeless 
are estimated to use drugs or alcohol, accord- 
ing to Housing Now, 

Few communities have adequate detoxifica- 
tion facilities available, let alone opportunities 
for the poor lo rehabilitate. 

Related to die drug problem is the prevalence 
of AIDS and HIV infection. Tliose infected 
with HIV face a deadly dilemma. They face 
contagious illnesses in the shelters, and physi- 
cal stress in the streets. 

If the government offered housing help to 
tliose put at risk by these problems, their effect 
wouldn't be as catastrophic. 



They don't. Between the fiscal years of 1981 
and 1988 the H.U.D. budget authority for 
housing assistance was cut by 80 percent. 

Among Western industrialized nations, the 
United States has the lowest proportion of sub- 
sidized housing units. In 1987. only 29 per- 
cent of 7.7 million renter households below 
the poverty line lived in public housing or 
received government rental assistance, says 
Housing Now. 

Thai's not a victory for the free-market sys- 
tem. Considering the weakened economy, ii 
looks like the bottom is ready to fall out from 
under America's poor. 

Yet government housing efforts are still 
geared toward home ownership for the upper 
middle classes. Homeowners deduct some 
S50 billion in propeny tax and morlgage inter- 
est payments, a subsidy that totals six limes 
the amount the government spends directly on 
housing assistance for the ixwr. 

For a homeowner in the SI 00,000-5200,000 
income class, the average deduction comes to 
S5262. For a homeowner earning under 
SIO.OOO the deduction average is $35. 

To avert a disastrous housing gap this centu- 
ry, groups like the National Low Income 
Housing Coalition are recommending we 
spend $40 bUlion a year. That's triple die cur- 
rent H.U.D, budget. Sounds expensive, but 
that figure is just 15 percent of the current mil- 
itary budget. '"" ■ 

Directing subsidies for new housing toward 
charitable groups (and not profit-seekers) 
could be one way to ensure the quality of new 
projects starts high and can be kept up. 

Establishing subsided cooperatives with 
existing housing-rights groups would let the 
lower-class be homeowners. Adding a tax 
write-off for cooperative members would be 
an additional incentive. 

Whatever the extent of the American com- 
mitment, the push for change in the housing 
picmre has to come from the moneyed classes. 
As much time as the Bushes. Foleys. Lugars, 
and Longs in Washington spend pandering to 
the middle class, they should be ready to 
respond when the bourgeois demand a halt to 
die bleeding. 

Besides, people without addresses can't vote. 



Rehabilitating this old, 
ailing American giant 



By K.L. Carofr 
Staff Wriler 

The other day, I stood outside Kettler Hall 

and watched students as they hustled their way 
to class. They looked healthy, and, since die 
pursuit of higher education is an optimistic 
enterprise, they generally looked cheerful. 

Gee, I thought, they don't look sick. Their 
backs look strong; their knees don't appear to 
be buckling. But those I observed who are 
part of the great American middle class are ail- 
ing. As cells that help make up the giant body 
of the middle class, they are suffering from a 
nasty illness~die bad economy. 

The economic giant of which each middle- 
class American is a part, is, I diink, lo Ameri- 
can culture what Atlas was to the ancient 
Greeks, Since he is essentially human, I've 
named him Bob-though he is as much a wom- 
an as a man. 

For two centuries. Bob has been a basically 
healthy giani. Oh, he had some troubles in the 
late 19ih century and he's had a headache now 
and dien, but except for diat nasty ailment in 
the 1930s, he has enjoyed rude healUi. Ameri- 
cans rejoiced in his good condition, knowing 
that Bob's health was essential to their own, as 
most of ihcm were part of diis giant. But it 
wasn't just the middle class who had an inter- 
est in promoting Bob's vigor. Bodi the rich 
and the poor did as well. For the giant strad- 



dles the American economic scene on his 
hands and knees. It is on his back diat die rich 
stand and under his belly that the ptxir take 
shelter. 

Sadly, during the last two decades or so, the 
healdi of our economic giant began to serious- 
ly decline. And nobody has seemed inclined 
lo treat the patient. The rich, freed by 
Reaganomics in the 1980s, trampled Bob's 
broad shoulders and generally weakened him 
by engaging in costly takeovers and the like. 
The middle class struggled to hang together, 
though far too nlany of them ended up under- 
ncadi the giant. As for die poor, well, as Bob 
got weaker and smaller, they grew and muld- 
plied. By the beginning of this decade, a once 
titanic, vital figure had become hollow-eyed, 
weak-kneed and peevish— on the verge of 
becoming a permanent semi-invalid. 

In die 1990s, we must resolve to cure the ail- 
ing giant Those of us who make up the mid- 
dle class must fight die current economic ail- 
ments with whatever medicine will work besi- 
-even if it tastes bad fliigher laxes). Once the 
giant begins to recover, we must vaccinate him 
against future serious ailmenls with education. 
And Uie lime to begin Ircaimcnl is right now. 
Because if Bob gives way, then the rich will 
fall, the middle class will crumble and die poor 
will be crushed.

That is 500 people you saw at a

Where have you been? You arc

it comes to Catholics and Fellow

homeless shelter in town is run by 
Christians. Ever hear of Fort Wayne 
Rescue Mission? How about 
Catholic Charities (Pregnant? need 
help? call...) Billboards all over 
town. Not? How about St. Marys

Child Abuse is attacked by strsslng

Anyway, what do you care for these 
problems? What have you done? 
Besides write a very lame commen- 
tary that barely mention the prob-

It seems to be nothing more than 
Political Fodder for you. 

#7) Here's where you really start 
Losing it 

"The Christian Church in the U,S. 
Lost (?) Moral Foreground during 
the sixties and Seventies. " To whom 
did thy lose Mora! Foreground? This 
isn't explained, 

"Christian Strictures" - "Don't 
cheat on your wife", "Don't Kill", 
"Respect your parents", "Don't Lie", 
"Don't be greedy or selfish," 
"RESPECT LIFE." These are 
Christian strictures. What's wrong 
with them? And you are right, 
"young" America pushed against 
these and Look what it has brought 
us: Sexual Diseases, unplanned 
pregnancys, an explosion of rapes, 
chits molcslings. Drugs. Porn. Kid- 



: Porr 



Sure 



around for ages, but not on this scale 
in a "civiLizcd' society. Thank the 
Sexual Revolution for the enormity 
of it all. 
H8) Sec #7 

As far as accepting Homosexuali- 
ty. Wbats next on your list of 
acceptable? Pedophelia? BestiaLity? 
And of course "The Sexual Revo- 
lution struck at the Basic Tenants of 
Christianity." To put it more con- 
cisely, the basic tenants of moral, 
orderly, society. 

The sexual free-for-all That has 
occurred has victemized children as 
well as men &amp; Women. 

Wi) 'Abortion became their place 
to retrench in the early 80's." Trying 
lo Write History? How pathetic. The 
above slalemcnl, of course is incor- 
rect The war against abortion start- 
ed in 1973 with "Roe" and it will 
end only when unborn children arc 
guanantecd a Right TO LIFE. 

#10) "Reversing the Sexual Revo- 
lution was the anti-abortion move- 
Here you go making History out as 
you see it (again) 

The "anti-abortion" (aka "Pro- 
Life") attempt is lo stop the murder 
business of Abortion (yes, business. 
Read the Back of the Busses; 
'Planned Parenthood with Three 
cbnics lo serve you") It is also not 
on allcmpL It is a comminment that 
wilt eventually overcome the Mur- 
der Business. Don't Ihiok it's mur- 
der? Look at the Pictures taken by 
abonionisls. 

E&gt;cstroying the sexual Revolution, 
however, isn't a bad idea. Tmie to be 
rid of ii and its sordid consequences. 
#11) "At Ibc Same Time, Pro-Lif- 
ers make Conception inevitable by 
oposing birih-conlrol" 

You make conception inevitable 
by 'doing it' And putting your trust 
in Condoms Is Like Sunran Wrap in 

The only birth control is Absti- 
nence, which requires self control. 
You screw around, well as the old 
adage goes "You make your bed. 
you sleep in it." That means if you 
produce a child. You ARE Respons- 
able. As for Rape and Incest is con- 
cerned that is truly a sad and tragic 
occurrence bol the child is not 



rcsponsable. 

Heres where I gel confused. "The 
Stain of sin and an unwanted baby 
become the fornicators (Fornication, 
acceptable?) Birthright" (Bom For- 
nicators?) I assume you mean stigmn 
but anyway, Fornication is a sin 
whether or not you take responsabil- 
ily and you have lo accept that if 
you "fornicate" you are a "Fomica- 

You mentioned women "subjected 
lo "Loving" abuse." 

1 wouldn't coll it abuse, reasonably 
offering aLlerlLnalives so as lo pre- 
vent the mother from making a hor- 
rifying. Life scarring mistake. Abor- 
tion is not a haircut, it is the annihi- 
Laiion of a human being. 

N13) You mention the homeless 
men (never mind homeless women 
and children?) in the park next lo the 
clinic, Yoii mean. the park (hat clinic 
workers have a view of every day? 
'Nuffsaid. 

W!4) Ah yes. The "cartoon". Nice 
to see 5,000 people you don't even 
know, characrerizcd as insensitive 
thugs. Who are blind. I can cite an 
example of 'wearing blinds." Pic- 
tures of aborted babies. Evicence 
before your eyes, and the fetus is 
siill "not alive" or bctlcr yet, 'A 
moss of cells'. Who is wearing 
bLinders? Mr. Gruse (is it) exihits 
RemarKablc depth of ignorance. 

In closing. Chad old l&gt;oy. Content 
aside. In this commentary. The weak 
prose, arguemenis and research 
prove a conclusion I've come to, that 
being The Communicator is 
insignificant drivel. Nol to mention 
The putrid editing (proofread before 
you pring) Please don't call yourself 
an editor or a Journalist You arc a 
hack. Before I end This, you men- 
tioned Catholics ond Protestants 
oppose sex education. Once again 
Wrong. I am a Catholic born and 
raised. Pve had sex education. The 
difference with Calhohc and Chris- 
tian sex education is that we doi?l 
hand oui condoms at recess. ■ 

In the future, stay with Vender

THE COMMUNICATOR 



Ervin attacks Pro-Life letter calls for peace 



To the Editor: 

This Idler is in response to Ihe three 
leitcrs that appeared In last week's issue 

of The Communicaior rebutiing the 
views of Mr. Hcsiing on Ihe issue of 
abonion. 

Lei me begin by staling my belieTs 
regarding this uniesolvabic conflici. I'm 
sure that I will noi get an argument Trom 
either factloti when I say thai ihe abor- 
tion procedure is a violcnl and painful 
practice. I know the tenor and anguish 
ihai a woman feels before and after 
aborting her child because I have had to 
help a close friend cope with the ordeal. 

I can honestly say that I am opposed to 
resorting lo abortion as binh control 
since many prophylaclic melhods are 
readily available, bui I also believe that 
It Is a necessity in some cases. Abortion 
must remain legal. 

I have done much research on the sub- 
ject in the form of clinical sludics. per- 
sonal essays, and conversaiions with 



many people including my grandparenis. 
aunis and uncles, sisters, and friends: 
yes, several are Chnsiian. The undeni- 
able truth Ihai all agree upon is that 
when abortion was illegal, women slill 
sought Ihem. Several survived the pro- 
cedure but 3 significani proportion lost 
Uieir lives lo raging infections. 

Mr. Marbach waxed emotional on ihc 
sanctity of life and the wonderful deeds 
of the church, but he failed to Inform us 
as to whether he provided transponation 
for women lo their doctor and purchased 
conception inhibiilon so that they didn't 
need to icrminatc the life of a felus. 

1 respectfully suggest that he and his 
band of missionaries acknowledge that 
they arc "whipping the wrong end of the 
horse" and concenlrale their efforts on 
Ihe provision of contraceptives to ihc 
young people and underprivileged so 
that ihey may be freed from ihc physical 
and emotional lonure of abortion. 

As a biologist, 1 have not found much 



use for Bible-lhumping. and I have been 
heard lo refer to the zealous objeciors as 
Super-Chrisiians. I coined Uiis unsavory 
lerm as a one-word illusiration protest lo 
iheir self-serving manipulation of the 
lexl of perhaps the finest book on ihe 
planet. 

I offer as an example the command- 
ment thai states. "Thou shall not kill. " It 
doesn't say. "Thou shall not kill other 
people," or "Thou shall not kill blaslu- 
lae." or "Thou shall not kill ciliated 
auloirophic protests"! It means exactly 
what ii says. This means, according to 
scripture, ihai we are all destined to be 
bacon in Satan's breakfast skillei. My 
poini is that regardless of religious con- 
victions, none of us is beiler or more 
deserving than another and efforts lo 
pass judgmeni on others is not only hyp- 
ocritical but also seir-deslruciive. 

If you're interested in saving souls, 
then save your own by ceasing to live, 
for every day that we exist, we are 
killing some organism for our own bene- 



rn. 

As an address to Lahna Riddle's ranl- 
ings about aborting ihc degenerating 
portion of world society (which at this 
time is a majority), I would like to pro- 
pose a Gaean analogy. Homo sapeins 
have become Immune lo Ihe ecology of 
the Earth and we are in essence a cancer 
upon the planet. Wc rob her of her ener- 
gy and resources, and offer little, if any- 
thing, 10 Ihe strength and health of the 
"organism." If we do not halt the expo- 
nential growth of our population our- 
selves, we will crumble like ihe mold on 
adecinmed grape. 

I do not propose abortion as Ihc "ulii- 
maie answer." I do. however, believe 
that ai this point in our evolution that we 
use every means a! our disposal lo inhib- 
it all contributions lo the seething over- 
populaied mass that starves in cesspools, 
hides behind the illusion of drugs, and 
creates wars to gain space for nations 
growing out of control. Perhaps wc 



ought 10 use your concept of peace! Just 
think, if we allow women lo die from 
non-sicrilc abortion wounds, theu even- 
tually there would be a decrease In ihe 
fecundity of the species and thus a 
red uc lion In the baby siorm. 

Everybody, open your damned eyes! 
We are dying and we are doing nothing 
10 Slop ii. It is nol and never has been ,i 
question of pro-life or pro-choice. Our 
very existence is threatened, and unless 
we work as a icam and conglomeraic our 
respective ideals Inio a working whole, 
there will be nobody lefi lo debate the 
morality of our acUons. 

Make no mistake about ii, life wilt 
continue on this planet whether we are 
here lo see it or nol! We have lo live in 
harmony with each other and the rest of 
the biosphere if wc want our grandchil- 
dren lo be free of all of ihc terrors thai 
wc face today.

Mark Snyder responds to Miller on police safety issue 



To Ihc Editor: 

Well, well, well! A member of ihe 
IPFW faculty responded to my challenge 
10 speak-oul. Unfonunaicly. however, 
this obvious mouthpiecc-for-thc-admin- 
■ isiration has chosen lo attack this writer 
' personally rather than address ihc issue 
', of inadequate campus security. This 
comes as no surprise. It has become the 
cotnmon practice in our society to attack 
the credibility of critics and whistle- 
blowers as a means of diffusing and 
obfuscating the issue. "If you can't beat 
'em, discredit 'em." seems to be the mot- 
to of our day and age. Ms. Conna Miller 
seems to be no encepiion. 



After one wades through the defama- 
tion (or might I say defecation) of ihe 
firsl five paragraphs in Ms. Miller's let- 
ter (and I would suggest hip boots for 
this type of wading) what we are left 
with is a lengthy and tedious piece of 
public relations fiuff. 

Ms. Miller was apparcoUy encumbered 
by Ihe blinders of the "specialist" she 
professed lo be as she failed to address 
the point of my leiler: thai the Depart- 
ment of Police and Safety at IPFW is 
well below the level of staffing called 
for In its fiscal budget. Instead. Ms. 
miller chose lo defend an individual 
(Paul Stiouls) who 1 did not attack, sug- 



Whistles are 'a joke' 



To Ihc Editor: 

They're going lo disiribuie whistles 
again, great. This brings to mind my 
first years ai IPFW. around 1975 I 
believe. I was a part-time freshman in 
English with a 2 1/2-year-old son. In 
,1975, I.U. consisted of Keitler Hall, 
Neff Hall, and two iroms in between for 
Ihe new day-care center and campus 
police. 

One concern at the lime was making 
sure your hood was latched and your car 
locked before you weni lo classes (bal- 
teries were being sidle ti at the time). 
The other was rape whistles. They 
proved a futile effort though. Rumors 
circulated of one rape and numerous 
atlacks in "the lots" within the academic 
year. The whistles went, and mace 
arrived. 

I doubt ihat anything was actually 
reported on campus at ihe lime. Rape 
.was regarded as something thai hap- 
pened to women who "asked for it." 
Also, campus police were then held in 
rather low regard. One of Ihe officers 
(no longer here) had jusi been repri- 
nianded for accidentally discharging his 
weapon through the safety irom into the 
day-care trom (no one was hurt, lucki- 
ly). We avoided campus police back 
then- thank God somethings do change. 

My point Is. whistles are a Joke, 
■They're meant to alcn bystanders to step 
in and help. If people were aware and 
concerned enough, whistles wouldn't be 
necessary. If noi, whistles could actual-

sense of security and keeping them from 
taking action ihat could prove more 
effective to iheir own defense. 

And phone numbers on whisdes are 
laughable. You find an attacker who 
will wail until you find your whistle, 
locale an available phone that works, 
and actually contact someone, and 
maybe we could call ii an effective plan. 
Short of thai, I think Ihc originators of 
this "whistle" idea need lo gel a life—or 
at least look at Ihe realities of life on 
campus and ihc world around us.

gest thai my "facts" are incorteci with- 
out offering correct ions, and blame the 
campus community for creating demor- 
alized police officers (we don't smile ai 
them enough!) 

Your "expertise in law enfotcemeni" 
noiwlthsianding, it is you, Ms. Miller, 
who needs lo arm yourself with more 
than "mouih and pen." Ii is obvious lo 
readers of this newspaper that you did 
not bother to check my "facis" with 
interim police chief Paul Strouts as Mr. 
Strouts, in an article which appeared in 
Ihe same Issue of this newspaper as your 
leiter. is quoted as confirming the 
staffing level which I reported in my 
original letter to the editor. Would you 
now suggest ihat Mr. Strouls. loo. suf- 
fers from a "lack of brain power" or is 
"puerile"? Maybe he Just needs lo 
"check his fads," eh Ms. Miller. After 
all a lecturer in SPEA would certainly be 
more aware of the situation in the 
Deparimeni of Police and Safety than 
would its Interim chief. It would seem, 
however, ihat Ms. Miller is not all 



wrong. I did commit an error in my lei- 
ler. I suggested that some faculty mem- 
bers were "Isolated in their search for 
pedantic truth." I stand corrected. Iso- 
lated and searching, yes; for truth, noi 
necessarily. Keep on searching. Ms. 
Miller. 

Ms. Miller, this writer did check his 
fads. His facts came directly from 
members of ihe deparimeni you would 
defend. Unfortunaiely these Individuals 
cannot come forward as ihcy have suf- 
fered real or perceived recrimination for 
talking to concerned studenis on previ- 
ous occasions. It is a sad siiuaiion that 
exists when members of this university's 
faculty, staff, and administration feel 
they must uirn lo a student to voice their 
concerns. I will not violate Iheir irusl 
simply lo validate my credibility with 
you and your Ilk. If that means I must 
suffer ridicule then so be it. 

Finally, upon re-reading Ms. Miller's 
verbose letter, I am reminded of a for- 
mula Slanislav Andreski noted in his 
classic "The Social Sciences as Sor- 



cery." "Verbiage increases to the extent 
thai ambiiion exceeds knowledge." Ii 
would certainly appear thai Ms. Miller 
does nol wont of ambition, at leasi! 
Meanwhile I will stand behind the slaic- 
menis and facts contained in my original 
Idler but wiih this postscript regarding 
the University's use of siailstics; "Fig- 
ures don'i lie but lian can figure."

THE COMMUNICATOR 



Stressed editor takes frustrations out on jerk students 



By Jim Walker 
Editor In Chief 
Before you commence reading ihis, 
and I mean Ixiiii of you. I'd like lo set 
Ibosc straight who arc under the 
presupposed notion that this column 
will be mcan-spirilcd. inaccurate, 
disjointed and dumb. You arc right! 

Tlic Angle may have a harder edge 
than usual this week because I've been 
especially cranky lately. It seems I've 
been taken off the Prozac. 

So If I drill your best pal. mother or 
much-adored family pet in the words 
that follow, forgive me. Or don't, see If 
I care. 

DUMB LETTER DUDES - I very 
much enjoy reading and printing the 
letters to the editor we receive here at 
The Conununicaior. 

It is a special treat for me when we 
get letters that take issue with our staff 
opinions. It's fun lo see what YOU 
think! 

But I've been disturbed lately by the 
sort of letters arriving in the mail. 
These letters not only tell us our 
opinions are wrong, ihey cut on us as 
people. 

There's just no room for that sort of 
meanness here kids! 

llie focus should remain on the issue 
at hand. There's no reason for students 
to resort to petty and childish name 
calling. 

We are all brothers and sisters in the 
great big cuckoo crazy world and we 
just have lo get along belter. Hey 
James Mount, how about a great big 
hug? 

And by the way, those students who 
wrote letters saying bad stuff about us 
are wart-faced, smelly, bottom- 
feeding, bus station dwelling, fat head 
losers, Thank you. 

FRESH DUMB FORUM ■ Oh joy. 
there's a brand new nickel and dime 
underground xeroxed newsletter 
blowing around campus. 

It's called Fresh Young Fonim and il 
really sucks. The last underground 
xeroxed newsletter. The Alienator, was 
sometimes witty and always odd. But 
as cheap newsletters go, the Alienator 
was pretty cool. 



This FYF thing, on the other hand, 
sucks. 

The first issue, available in hallway 
trash cans now, has sort of a Rambo 
meets Ted Nugent mentality. The 
newsletter's first issue features an anti- 
gun control "cdiiorial" and a list of 
upcoming area rock and roll concerts, 
FYF also 



But there's something unsettling for 
me over at the cleverly named 
Multipurpose Building, I fear Spandex 
explosion. 

The Donnettes. who are lovely ladies. 



w^m 




included an 
advertisement for a Student Action 
Project event. The people at SAP, an 
IFFW student organization, tell mc 
they are pro-gun control and they had 
no idea Caption Jelly Whale. FYFs 
e&lt;Jilor. was running the ad next to his 
militant editorial. 

But the people at SAP did say they 
found the listing of area concerts 
"handy." 

Here's a couple lips for Editor Whale, 
I, Focus, focus, focus. The NRA and 
EMF just don't mix. 2. Never print 
your little flyer again. Save a tree 
instead, or in this case, a shrub. 

THE DOUGHNUTS - I attend 
IPFW's home basketball double 
headers whenever 1 can and 1 really get 
a kick out of the whole event 

The teams are exciting lo watcb, the 
junk food is cheap and there are 
always plenty of eood seats available. 



If a pair of those shorts was to burst 
off of one of the Donnelte's bums, it 
could fly into the stands with the ihnist 
equal to that of a Patriot missile. 
according to physics experts, 

I can just sec myself being gutted by 
a blur of man-made material. 

Anyway, for safety and aesthetic rea- 
sons I'd like lo see these ladies dance 
in something different. No offense to 
the fabulous Donnettes, but those 
tourniquet shorLs have got to go before 
more than our eyes are injured. 

THE ANGLE LIST - Hot: rape tri- 
als, the return of Magic Johnson, Lou 
Reed, student (joon, Paul Tsongas, Pat 
Buchannan. Nick Nolle. Rebecca 
DcMomay, Phi Kappa Thcia, alcoholic 
beverages, Elvis stamps, Liquid Tele- 
vision, Nirvana, Garth Brooks, Bobby

nio Hall. Winger, Alabama, Gene 
Kcady, The Dollar Tree, pet rocks. 
Nancy Barger and The United Slates 
of America. 

FINALLY - Once again, here's a 
clever tip for our greener students 
struggling through W131 or some oth- 
er English class. Never, ever, end 
something you've written with the 
word "finally,"

70's revivial 



Twentysomethings face disco revival 



By Sarah Jakacky 
Features Editor 

Do you live in fear thai Saturday 
Nighi Fever disco parties will replace 
brew and boot beer blasis, or ptaifonn 
shoes will replace L.L. Bean boots, or 
Barry Maiiilow will replace Fresh 
Prince? 

If so, you arc probably twcniysomc- 
thing, say five Harvard graduaies who 
wrote "Stuck in the Seventies: 113 
Things from the 1970's tliat screwed 
up the Twenlysomeihing Generation." 
This generation has little to show for 
themselves. They were in diapers dur- 
ing Woodstock, if they were alive at 
all, and in strollers for the protest 
marches. The biggest scandal of their 
time, the hook suggests, was that 
Mikey from Life cereal died from 
sucking down too many Pop Rocks 
and drinking Coca Cola. 

They used phrases like "sit on it" and 
baked tiny cakes in Easy-Dakc ovens, 
and searched for subliminal sex mes- 
sages in posters and TV commercials. 
And yes, they loved disco songs like 
Boogie Oogie Oogie by Taste of Hon- 
ey. Kung Fo Fighting by Car! Douglas 
and Disco Duck by Rick Dees and his 
cast of idiots. 

And now just look around. Aliliough 
it's the 90s college students every- 



where can be seen dusting off disco 
albums and donning brown polyester 
leisure suits for 70s panics. There is a 
resurgence in lite "Brady Bunch" and 
"Love Boat" reruns, and both pro- 
duced frightening Ncilsen ratings. 

More clues of the 70s revival 
include the Village People louring 
again, Aerosmith signing ihe largest 
recording coniract in history, the 
resurgence of blacklighi posters and 
mood rings, and Uic return of betlbot- 
toms. Even more disturbing evidence 
is that Donny Osmond is staging a 
comeback, M.C. Hammer now sings a 
cover of "Feelings," and MTV is air- 
ing classic "Saturday Night Live" 
skits. 

Tliis leaves us with many questions 
to answer according to the book. 
What are the primary symptoms of 
boogie fever? How do mood rings 
really work? What exactly is a 
SIcesiack and where is the Land of the 
Lost? If we can understand the 70s, 
we can emotionally prepare for the 
decade that lies ahead. 

In tlie meantime, if you discover a 
mirrored ball hanging in Walb. or lava 
lamps mysteriously appearing on cam- 
pus, contact the 70s hotline immedi- 
ately. 



Then and Now 

How do the Seventies compare with today? Are we better off?

Genesis visits IPFW, 73 



By Sarah Jakacky 
Features Editor 

"Genesis received a 15 minute stand- 
ing ovation at their lU-PU concen last 
weekend." 

This was the caption that ran in die 
Dec. 7 issue of The Communicator 
explaining the Genesis concen, Dec, 
7. 1973, that is. 

The 1973 Communicator article on 
Genesis performing on campus said, 
"Genesis is a rock band whose talent 
and creativity are just being recog- 
nized. Though they have built a solid 
reputation based on their performance 
abroad, the group began to win 
acclaim in this country only when ihey 
played here early in 1973." 

In the beginnings of the group. 
Genesis consisted of Peter Gabriel, 
lead vocalist ,\yho was knoivn for his 
iheatricaT costumes: ^teve Hackett. 
guitarist; Tony 'Banks, keyboardist; 
Mike Rutherford, who played electric 
bass and acoustic guitar; and Phil 
Collins, drummer. 

The article stated that Collins, a vir- 
tual unknown, rarely played solos 
because he refused "to show off his 
technique." 

According to Hackett and Ruther- 
ford, the audience was impressive. 
"The crowd was great, really great," 
said HackeiL 

Genesis was only in its filth year of 
performing together when they played 
at IPFW. The concert, according to a 
previous article, was "dynamic." 

The hght show, sound, uniqueness of 
music style, and Gabriel's elaborate 

aitire a)ntribuicd lo the success of the 

show. 



"Onstage they were all dressed casu- 
ally except for Peter Gabriel, who 
wore helmets, masks, or costumes 
depending on the song. He empha- 
siied die theatrical aspect by assuming 
the roles of characters in the music and 
wearing costumes which ranged from

startling to the bizarre." 

Although the concert was excellent 
and Genesis received a 15 minute 
standing ovation, IPFW students arc 
still waiting for an encore.

Mastodons fall from first 



By Joe Heershe 
Sports Editor 

History has a way of repealing iiself, 
and the IPFW men's basketball pro- 
gram has seen hislory repeat itself 17 
times. For the llih consccuiivc time 
Kcnmcky Wesieyan has beai IPFW in 
Grcal Lakes Valley Conference play. 
Wesieyan. with and enrollment of 800 
students has won sijt NCAA Division 
II National Championships with the 
last in 1990, 

On Saturday. Feb. 1, the Mastodons 
were given a history lesson by junior 
forward Mike Gray of Kentucky Wes- 
ieyan. Gray connected on six of seven 
(brce-poini field goals en route to a 
game high 29 points in the Panthers' 
107-91 victory. 

Gray's six three-point field goals 
doubled the output of the entire IPFW 
team from the tlirec-poini range as 
they went 3 of 18. As a team the Pan- 
thers shot 61 percent from the three- 
point range, hitting 1 1 of 18 shots. 

The Mastodons were able to keep the 
score close through the first half. Only 
a three-point field goal by Wesleyan's 
Herb Arnarson with nine seconds left 
separated the learns at the half at 50-47. 

The Mastodons then started the sec- 
ond half without scoring in the first 2 
1/2 minutes of play, allowing the Pan- 

Lady 'Dons 
lose by one 

Ity JoeHeershe 
Sports Exiitor 

The IPFW women's basketball team 
dropped to third place in the Great 
Lakes Valley Conference with a loss 
to Kenmcky Wesieyan (7-4) on Satur- 
day. 

Northern Kentucky's (9-3) victory 
over firei place, and previously unde- 
feated. St. Joseph's (10-1) on Saturday 
by a score of 75-67, moved them into 
sole position of second place, breaking 
a tie with IPFW (8-3) in the confer- 
ence .standings. 

The Lady 'Dons were narrowly 
defeated by the Kentucky Wesieyan 
Panthers by a score of 69-68. Ken- 
tucky Wesieyan. shooting 57 percent 
from the field in the first half, went up 
by seven with two minutes left AU- 
American candidate. Lisa Miller, of 
IPFW, shooting nearly 80 percent 
from the free-throw line for the sea- 
son, went two of six from the charily 
stripe in an uncharacteristic manner, in 
■he last two minutes of the half and 
was unable to close the gap before half 
time. 

Starling the second half with a sev- 
en-point deficit, the Lady 'Dons were 
assisted by a poor 37 percent shooting 
performance by the Panthers to close 
the margin of victory to only one 
point. However, with only three free 
throws scored with the clock a 1:28 lo 
go, the Lady 'Dons could not over- 
come the eoiire deficit. 

The Lady 'Dons were lead by senior 
Lisa Miller with 22 points. Pam 
Edwards added 15 points and 10 
rebounds, and Tina Menier 13 points 
for IPFW. 

Kentucky Wesieyan was paced by 
two 18-poini performances by Can- 
dice King and Octavia Dean. Jenny 
Boyd added 15 rebounds and 12 
points to the victory. 

The Lady 'Dons travel to GLVC 
rival Kentucky State University 
tonight lo try lo slay near the top of 
the standings. Kentucky Stale is win- 
less in the GLVC at 0-9. 



thcrs lo build a seven-poini lead, and 
only scored four points in the first 5 
1/2 minutes. This dry spell gave Wes- 
ieyan a 14-point margin in what had 
been a three-point contest. 

The Mastodons never recovered from 
this early Wesieyan nin of the second half 
and lost by 16 with a score of 107-91. 

In the last four match ups between 
IPFW and Wesieyan, the Panthers 
have won by average of 15 points. 

The Mastodons were lead by junior 
Sean Gibson with 21 points and senior 
Duan Shears with 19. Eric Vaughn 
added 14 points in 17 minutes of pby 
for IPFW. Two Panthers. Steve 
Divine and Alex Kreps. added twenty 
each to Gray's 29 points to lead Ken- 
tucky Wesieyan. 

On Thursday, Feb. 6, the Mastodons 
handily beat Southern Indiana 97-78 lo 
go 8-2 in the conference and stay in a 
two-way tie wiUi Ashland, However. 
with Saturday's loss to Wesieyan. 
IPFW moved to second place in 
GLVC standings at 8-3.

the GLVC standings with victories 
over Kentucky Wesieyan 93-77 on 
Thursday, Feb. 6 and a 99-83 win over 
Southern Indiana on Saturday, Feb. 8
