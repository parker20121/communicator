"A college degree does not entitle you

Schulli and Othersen said Ihe 
demand for specialized graduates in 
data processing, engineering, and 
medical services has improved in the 
Fort Wayne area. "With the technical 
area, more often than not, they are 
recruited directly off campus" Schultz 

The situation for social science and

. while education was ■ 
good degree to ha ve in order lo secure a 
teaching position, it burls chances lor 
other jobs since prospective employers 
think that the Job candidate would 
rather be leaching. 

Barkhaus said that the major asset to 
a liberal arts degree graduate Is Ihe 
development of the graduate's writUn 

that despite those skills, the llbcnl

Referring to Ihe eipcctallons ol

liberal arts graduates, Barkhaus laid 
(hat the liberal arts graduates had

; Building a new Alhlelie Center didn'l 
solve the problem either. The northwest 
^valkway between the Walb Union and 
llhc ALhIelic Center has only aboul q half- 
dozen lights, three of which appear to 
have sunk several feet into the earlh 
since they were erected. 
; Many would wonder why The Com- 
^unlcalor is concerned wilh the lack of 
outside lighting on this campus After 
the comments un the overall ughness 
nnd sameness of IPFWs buildings, 
which appeared in this space in the Nov. 
nighl suppose we would 
advi&gt;cale eved poorer lighting. That way 



noone would have to look at this campus 
at all after sundown, 

i^n The Communicator never be 
appeased? 

Probably not 

But there are niore serious aspects of 
the lighting problem. Many students 
Icar to walk across campus after dark. 
Some carry mace or rape whlsUes; 
others ask Ihe campus police to escort 

But a college campus is not a place one 
should have to carry weapons, and 
safely and security people, those always 
willing to help, do not really have the 
manpower In the evening to walk 
everyone to safety. 

The Communicator feels it would be 
cost effective, if only in terms of time 
and peace of mind, to install a belter 
lighting system on Ibis campus. One that 
Isperhapsa bit less ornamental and a bit 
more protective. 

There have been no reported violent 
crimes at IPFW. One woman was ac- 
costed jusl (his semester, but that 
happened in broad daylight, and she 
escaped unharmed. 

However, nighl crime is a reality, both 
nn college campuses and in the city of 
Fort Wayne. Luck is all that has 
protected students here so far. and luck 
can run out without warning.

TTie method that Lipman 
worked with in this research 
is callolconibiclortcs. which 
according to him is "fancy

"Subtle changes in tbc 
ocean floor indicate changes 
in altitude, much like that of 
Uie land surface and there 
ETC malhematical equations 
to determine what these 
gravity changes mean." 

Much of Llpman's work 
was highly classified, but be

that we establish methods to

defense of our country may 
depend upon being able to
