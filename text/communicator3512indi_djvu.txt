A luncheon completed the event in which 
Jischke was presented wilh questions ranging 
from the grading scale lo the evaluation ol teach- 
ers One af the issues covered was thai of resi- 
dence halls According id Jischke, university- wide 
jJmini-lntion has been M!pp..itive of the creation 
of residence halls Chancellor Michael Wanell 
staled that ihc initial goal ".is to build halls capa- 
ble of accommodating 500 beds 

Tonya Ryan. 1PSGA member and psycholo- 
gy major, asked Jischke what could be done in 
order to make it easy for sludenls lo pursue 
American Sign Language (ASL) as a foreign lan- 
guage According in Ryan. student- must lind 
campuses that offer the program and depending on 
whether or not they meet ihe foreign language 
requirements of Purdue's main campus, follow 
petition procedures. 

"The issues of academic offerings at this 
campus are under the decision of Ihis faculty, so 
the questions of what will be offered, when il will 
be offered and the number of credits earned 
depend on this campus' faculty," said Jischke. 

Accounting major Chris Moore asked about 
the decision 10 embrace Ihc plus and minus grad- 
ing scale, which he heard was in effect as of this - 
semester in West Lafayette, and also asked 
whether or not there was any truth lo what he had lp SGA President 
heard. According lo Wartell. the final decision 

about the plus and minus scale had noi been made. _, ,_ 

Wartell also said that there was a conflict between 
Indiana University and Purdue University regarding the 
scale and that both universities' programs had yet to 
come together and mate a decision aboul the subject. 

The issue of teacher evaluations was also brought 
up at the meeting According to Nicl Gray, student body 
president, the group warns a fair plan and is moving 
slowly to ensure that, ir made public, the evaluations 
will be advantageous lm both sludenls and teachers 
Jischke believes that if Ihc goal of the evaluations is to

season is approaching 

The Morbidity Murulin Weekly Report recently 
reported that influenza, more commonly knnwn as the 
flu. contributes to approiimately 20.000 deaths and 
1 10.000 hospitalizations each year in the United Slates. 
The flu is usually a sdl-limiting disease that lasts from 
two to seven day-; Highly cnniagn.iu!., it spreads rapidly 
where groups of pouple interact. Tins results in govern- 
ment and health jgency -related strategies to vaccinate 
large population segments Otherwise, the flu risks 
lives, strains the health care system and results in lost 
work days.

symptoms An annual vaccination against the flu is the 
primary means of ptc venting it. 

Studies shun thai heaiihy. im irking adults benefit 
from vaccination. A study in The New England Journal 
of Medicine published in 1 995 found that healthy, work-

reported 25 percent fewer episodes of upper respiratory 
illness. They also rcf.irtc-J -P percent tewcrdays of sick

for type B. For every 1 00 walkers who reported respira- 
tory illness with fcier. those vaccinated were sick 28.7 
days total, compared with 40.6 days for those not vacci-

Also, the FDA has applied regulatory action 
against two producers, further delaying available flu
