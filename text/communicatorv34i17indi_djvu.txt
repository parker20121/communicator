ALBANIA 



The Communicator 



Albania. 

If asked, most Americans 

probably couldn't identify this lit- 
tle Balkan country, let alone find it 

Well, except Bemd Fischer. 

Fischer, a professor and chair 
of the history department at 
Indiana-Purdue Fort Wayne, spe- 
cializes in Albanian history and 
current affairs. He has taken 
numerous trips to the Balkans for 
research projects and conferences, 
and regularly consults with the 
Albanian government. 

Fischer, who has been visiting 
the Balkans since the 5970s, took 
his first trip to Albania in 1988, 
when the country was still under 




Albania President Fatos Nano (left) poses with IPFW 
Professor Bemd Fischer during one of Fischer's visits. 



Fischer's group toured the 
country in a government-issued 
minivan "One day our driver was 
saluted by the police, and I started 
thinking that maybe this guy was 
more than just a driver," Fischer 
said with a grin. "They had seri- 
ously high lev els of security." 

According to Fischer, who 
has made several return visits 
since 1988, conditions in Albania 
have been chaotic since commu- 
nism's fall in 1990. He paints a 
grim picture of the current situa- 



"The political 
completely corrupted," he 
explained "There's a holdover 
from traditional Stalinist politics. 
Rivals deal with each other as ene- 
mies. There's no concept of a loyal 
opposition. There's also a tight 
connection between politics and 
crime — sometimes you can't tell 
one from the other." 

Fischer notes the Albanian 
economy and infrastructure are 



has let! since 1990. 

"Albania is often referred to 
as 'the white jeep state,'" Fischer 
said, referring to the vehicles driv- 
en by many international organi- 
zations. "The country is complete- 
ly dependent on international aid 
It doesn't produce anything." 

According to Fischer, 



Albania's outlook i: 

"The current prime minister- 
has all the qualities of a slick U.S. 
politician, but he's also evil," he 
explained with a wry smile. 

However, Fischer's personal 
experience qualifies his perspec- 
tive on Albania. 

"Albanians are just spectacu- 
lar people," he said. "They sing 
and drink a lot, and have an exu- 
berance for life." He believes they 
are also quite ingenious in dealing 



looking women while I was walk- 
ing clown the street I low can they 
manage to look like that when the

During the past three years, 
Fischer has testified as an expert 
witness in over 100 political asy- 
lum cases, mainly in the U.S. and 
Canada. He testifies in cases con- 



cerning Albania, Serbia, 

Montenegro, Kosovo and 
Macedonia. 

These testimonies take place 
either in court, by telephone, or by 
written atfidavit. 

Fischer's job is to give an 
accurate portrayal ol conditions in

Academic support available with CASA 



For students who need a little extra help in 
math, writing, or study skills, there is no plan 1 quite 
like the Center for Academic Support and 



Rachelle Darabi, director of CASA, encourages 
students to stop in to the center to learn about all the 
options that an ■available to them ,md see what works 
best. "We like to see students early in the semester 
and often," she said. 

Tutoring in many upper and lower 
level courses is a\ ailable at the SPOT in 
Kettier Hall Room C21. Students can 
receive two hours of one-to-one tutoring 
per week per class. Drop in tutoring,

The classes are 90 to 150 minute sessions 
and are on a first come, first served 

Upcoming STEPS training sessions 
include PowerPoint training on Feb. 2, 
and Word training on Feb. 11. Complete 
information on sessions being offered 
and the latest schedules are available on 
the CASA website at http:// ipfw.edu 
/casa/ sleps.html. 

Another resource for learning on cam- 
pus is the Writing Center, which serves 
not only undergraduate students but 
graduate students and faculty. 



Consultants are available to review a wide ranee of 
material including research papers, poetry, and fic- 
tion, even resumes and graduate school applications. 
Because appointments tend to fill up quickly, the cen- 
ter is now open at 9 a.m. during weekday hours. A 
sign up sheet is posted weekly outside .the office 
located in Kettier Hall Room G19. 

Individual study skill support is also available 
by appointment through CASA. Students can receive 
help with time management, speed reading, test tak- 
ing, and other related areas. Students can learn and 
better understand their learning style and come up 
with better study strategics. Darabi suggested all stu- 
dents take advantage of the various CASA programs. 

"The programs are flexible to get students what- 
ever help they may need," she says.

As of Tuesday morning, that 
arrest had not been made. 

A total of seven projectors

were taken during a two-week 
period between Sept. 23 and Oct.

daytime and led to new anti-thett

The LCD projectors have become 
a popular product for thieves in 
recent years, police explained in 
October. College authorities 
across the country have dealt with 
similar thefts due in part to the 
relatively lightweight, 
high expense and 
quality of the LCD 
merchandise.

Plenty of things to do on campus with various organizations 



By now, you've probably seen the flyers posted 

campus for volunteer services and other volunteer oppoi 

runines around Allen County. There are over 40 items 
and ideas listed on this poster tor all students and staff 



are self explanatory such as "Boy Scouts of America." This 
is a group that focuses on the younger male generation. 
Activities for this group include camp programs, commu- 
nity projects and volunteer services .tnd in -school pro-

The "Girl Scouts of Limberlosl Council" has the same 
general purpose of the "Boy Scouts of America" except for 
the fact that the group is centered around girls and not 

Other groups that are out there to help children of both 
genders include, but are nol limited to, "Hoys and Girls 
Clubs of America," 'The YMCA," and "The YWCA." 
Groups such as "AWS", and "Turnstone" are a bit more 
e than other groups on the list These two groups 
i the promoting of independence to those 

ment, therapeutic recreation, as well as interpreting for 
persons with disabilities. 

'Turnstone, concentrates more on getting the people 
out into the world on their own. "The League for the Blind 
and Disabled," is obviously a volunteer group that helps 
people who have Ihe misfortune of being blind or visually 
impaired. This is an excellent group with which to start. 

Groups for women exclusively include, but are also not 
limited to, "Fori YV.ivne Women's Bureau," which assists 
women in improving their economic status. !t also helps 



programs, and "The Washington House 
Treatment Center." 

For people who wish to volunteer for whole families, 

they could try giving assistance to groups like, "The 
Vincent House," which helps homele&gt;- families. 'The 
Salvation Army. SCAN The Parenl-C h, Id Connection," 
Neighborhood Health Clinics." "Career Services of Allen

Indiana Governor Joseph Kernan has said the current prohibition on same-sex 
marriage in Indiana is enough for the state, and amending the Indiana Constitution is 
unnecessary. Kernan is right. 

Constitutions are established to remind the government what the rights of the 
people are. They do not exist so the government can establish rules of controlling our 
most private behavior - even if the majority of people deem some private behavior 
immoral. 

Bush fears court decisions on the federal level are weakening the union of one- 
man-one-woman when Ihev become one in a spiritual, emotional and physical sense. 

Marriage is a spiritual institution before it is ,i legal institution. When two indi- 
viduals dedicate their lives to one-another, it should be' celebrated and not hounded. 

Of course, that is a spiritual and personal decision that should be left to the indi- 
viduals - and to the houses of worship where the marrying couple hopes its union will 
be recognized. 

And that's where the decision should be held first. Houses of worship have the 
right to decide what they deem is moral. That is how our Freedom of Religion works. A 
religion doesn't have to give their blessing, but a blessing from a religion isn't what all

the voters the legislators of states to decide what constitutes a married couple. 

If Hawaii wants to allow gavs to marry, the state should be allowed to do so. And 
yes, that marriage should be recognized in every other U.S. state and territory. If a man 
from the Middle East moves to America with five wives that he has legally married in 
his homeland, than that should be recognized as a legitimate marriage by our govern- 
ment. Just because a relationship is not a standard relationship doesn't mean it is an 
immoral or illegal marriage. 

Nobody is saying a house of worship doesn't have a say in which they marry.

ame against mterraual couples held out tor decades .liter that-- and remains today. 

And that will continue tor several generations - with interracial couples who 
marry and with gay couples who strive to marry. 

Tlie , ri -' ,,IV tlluSL ' U '' H&gt; argue it isn't nature same genders to couple for a lifetime. 
This was the same argument used lor generations to debate interracial relationships. 
There are also those who say the\ don't care what gays do, as long as they don't receive 
the title of married. ' Exactly how does this affect society in a negative way 7 It doesn't -- 
it is simply a way ol making one segment of society superior. 

In recent years, that tendency has started to 'slip away as sexuality has been seen 
less of a sin and more of an orientation. People will quote Leviticus or biology books to 
bolster their arguments, but the fact is lifetime lasting relationship-, should be blessed 
not condemned, by society. 

And the U.S. or state governments, via constitutional amendments, shouldn't 
have word one to say about it, Government exists to protect us from aggressors, not 
subject us to the momentary judgements of one generation. 



Ever wonder how significant vmn vote iv.ilh i-- 1 Dees your single vote 
count for anything when you consider that there are over 250 million 
other Americans out there, casting their votes as well? 

In reality, the number of Americans voting is considerably smaller than 
250 million. Over the 227 years America has been around, the ability to 
vote has become more and more taken for granted. These freedoms 
awarded us are neither common nor easily had in other countries, but 
this fact has escaped the general American public for some time now. 
Instead, we tend to lurn an apathetic eve to our political process, depend- 
ing on "everybody else" to run the country. The plain fact is, in the words 
of Winona LaDuke, "Democracy is not a spectator sport." 

It's well known that the youth of today feels completely disenfran- 
chised, but what isn't well known is thai this state of affairs is almost 
totally self-enforced. The older generations, who experienced World War 
It, Vietnam, and the Korean War first hand, (ought and died for the sake 
of America - and thus take full advantage of their rights, including the 
right to vote, in memory of those who went before. Those of us who 
haven't seen a true world war sometimes have a hard time understand- 
ing why it is so important to get to the polls each election day, which is 
why we are not, and perhaps never will be, a voting force to be catered 
to. Though regrettable, the war in Iraq does have one small silver lining: 
hopefully those young men and women who are serving faithfully will 
come to understand exactly how precious Hie right to vote really is, and 
help those of us who aren't there to understand as well. 

Here's an experiment that will always yield sad results: ask someone 
under the age of 25 what the three branches of the government are. More 
than that - ask them to name the two houses in Congress. Not only are 
we lacking in motivation to participate in our government, we are rather 
ignorant as to how it functions, as well. True, we are given a brief run- 
down of U.S. Government in elementary school, but after that there are 
few opportunities to learn about how Washington D.C. goes about gov- 
erning over the United States. Even the older generations have a hard 
time explaining how a caucus works. 

The only solution to this problem is to get the younger generations 
involved in the government. For most reading this, it's an individual 
responsibility. Yes, indeed, your vote does count. The idea that "every- 
body else" will take care of it for you is what is truly holding back the vot- 
ing power of the vouth today, because "everybody else" is thinking exact- 
ly the same thing. 

In the upcoming election season, take matters into your own hands. Get 
registered as an Indiana voter as soon as possible. Truly, it is something 
as simple as reading a few web sites, decided where you stand on the 
issues, picking a candidate to vote for, and actually voting for them. 
There are two perks - first, you get a sticker that says "I Voted!," and sec- 
ond, you have the right to say you've given back to the country that has 
given you so much.

Greek Life: 

It's not a matter of money 



thoughts that 

Thoughts to Rome, Feta cheese and 
togas are some. However, the odds 
are th.it it you .ire in college, when 
you hear the words "Greek life" 
you are going to think about par- 



know most of you are thinking 
when you think about us. I've been 
a member of a sorority for over a 
year now, and I can tell you that 
I've battled stereotypes when it 
comes Greek life. Thanks to such 
wonderful programs such as 
"Sorority Life" and "Fraternity 
Life" I know that Greeks every- 
where have had to deal with 
increased prejudicial behavior 
from GDIs. (For all of you playing 
our home game, a GDI is an inde- 
pendent,) However, those shows 
bear no semblance to anything I've 
r been a part of. 



to be involved with Greek Life, and 
bust a few of the common stereo- 
types that you may have. First of 
all, we don't pay for our friends. 
Mostof the time, people arc friends 
before they join the organization 
they eventually are a member of. 
' Common sense will tell you that 
they have to hear about the group 
somehow. People meet people in 
class, or know them from high 
school, and tell them about their 
organization. We wanted to meet 
new people, so we joined a Greek 
organization. We die! not say to our- 
selves, I'm going to pay money just 
so I have friends. That's ridicfiouv 
Yes, we pay dues to belong. Most 
people pay dues to belong to an 
organization, but get less out of it 
than we do. Some people tell me, 
"I've paid dues before, but I'd 
never pay that much." In the 
grand scheme of things, it's not 



relatively low. First of all, 
member of social Greek letter 
organizations, or GLOs, (a term to 
encompass all different nonprofes- 
sional sororities or fraternities I 
have badges. You are buying a 
piece of gold jewelry, so don't 
expect to pay only a couple of dol- 
lars. Our dues pay for much more 
than the badge, out also for our 
activities, food, suites in Watb, and 
for other different aspects of 
belonging to individual organiza- 
tions. For example, I know there 
are a number of GLOs that offer 
scholarships, fellowships or loans 
to their members. The opportuni- 
ty to get back not only what you 
put in, but more, is overwhelming 



the organizations they've shown. 
That's not even close to true. We 
don't have tear-filled, screaming 
matches like the ones that we were 
all witness to every week. Just like 
any group of friends that hang out 
together, there are the occasional 
disagreements. However, we have 
something that is so much better 
than a group ol people that are just 
friends We know that no matter 
what happens, we're still going to 



brothers. He 
much drama you witnessed 
ing those two IV series. just take 



tch- 



about 99.5 percent off and 
then you have the average drama 
for normal organizations. 

Thirdly, I've been asked if I've 
been hazed. The answer is no. I 
have never, in my entire time being 
in the Greek system, been hazed. 1 
don't own a paddle, I've never 



don't have plans to" I think it' 
stupid. Anyone that hazes anoth- 
er person loses all of my respect 
They say that paddling is the way 
that respect is taught. Newsflash: 
Respect isn't taught, it's earned 
and if you haze, vou don't deserve 
respect. 

Lastly, I've heard a number of dif- 
ferent people remark to me some- 
thing to the effect of "Greek Life is 
nothing but a giant party." No, 
sorry to let you down. We have no 
more parties than any group of col- 
lege-aged friends. We also don't 
party harder. You can't judge a 
group of people based on a show 
or movie, and being educated peo- 
ple, you should already realize 
that. Not only do we not party all 
the time, but we do a lot of things 
that 1 bet you never even noticed. 
It's easy to find out about the occa- 
sional party, but somehow you all 
seem to ignore the fivers that we all 
put up in attempts to get support. 
Usually an organization will nave 
a philanthropy that they support 
through fundraisers or community 
service hours. There have been 
cookie sales, bookdrives, blood 
drives and a skateboarding compe- 
tition in the last couple of years, 
but yet support from this campi 



completed, but 1 bet the number of 
you that knew that was a lot lower 
than the number that knew about 
the Homecoming Party last fall. 

Basil. ally, if you've never had per- 
sonal contact with a sorority or 
fraternity, odds are, everything 
that you assume is just that, an 
assumption, and you know what 
they say about assumptions. So 
next time your sitting in your class 
and someone walks in wearing 
Greek letters.talk to them. Most of

Football is a pretty complex sport 
considering chubby guys just run 
around and jump on top of each 
other for a funny shaped ball made 
of a pig's skin. 

I laving been in marching band in 
high school (no I didn't play flute

band director. The band director, 
Harry Dinkle, thought that 
"Football fields are for band prac- 
tice!" Who'da thunk it, you can use 
them for football, too. 

Until recently, I didn't know what 
a down was. Yes, I'm that dumb 
when it comes to football. A down, 
for those of you who Are as lost as I 
was, is a play. Each team gets four 
downs to go ten yards, so they get 
four chances to move the ball 3D 
feet closer to their end zone. 

How can a game with four quai

Then the gov whose only job is to 
kick the ball between the goal posts 
goes on the field to eam his $12

Are you fluent in Politician? 



The majority of my life is spent moving from one 
surreal experience to the next. From my weekly 
adventures in getting lost in Fort Wayne (driving the 
wrong-way on a four-lane road was' not my fault, I 
swear) to the freak show that is my place of employ- 
ment, I manage to see quite a wide swath of humani- 
ty. My most recent surreal moment happened just 
nights ago, at about midnight when I faced my two 
greatest dislikes: homework and politics. I attempted 
to simultaneously finish a worksheet on function 
equations whilst watching the democratic presiden- 
tial debate in New Hampshire. As with all bad ideas, 



before this political year, I thought that 1 could finish 
my assigned work and in addition, try and leam 
something— anything — about the ten thousand peo- 
ple vying for the Democratic presidential ticket. 

At my kitchen table I stared at my paper, trying to 
figure out what f(x) equals while the drone of the can- 
didates continued unrelenting on the television. 

1 remember that as 1 sat there, bleary eyed and frus- 
trated with the concept of linear equations at 12:00 in 
the morning, I would look up and hear the candi- 
dates spout off their campaign rhetoric in response to 
straightforward questions. 

Even now I can't decide whether the math or the 
candidates was more confusing. 

The only thing I learned is that I would take a thou- 
sand algebra equations over one political speech in 
an election year. 

In mathematics, you have to prove what you say. If 
"x" equals seventeen, you have to explain why — in 
words that people understand, in a logical fashion. 

If I had finished my homework the way that the 
candidates debated, the answer for variable "y" 
would have included the words "I think," "The 
American public wants..." and "If I am elected pres- 
ident" followed by a string of numbers and then the 
words "budget deficit not seen in years." And if my 
teacher asked me to clarify niv position, I could mere- 
ly say, "that's not at issue here." and then in an iron- 



ic twist, talk about mv plan tor education. 

This problem is not merely a disease of the 
Democrats; it is widespread across the entire political 
spectrum. And it is incredibly disheartening, because 
it otters no incentive to vote, no reason tor people to 
register and become involved in the political process 

Is the political process this way because it has to be 
or because we have let it get this way? 

However, it is true that the issues of 2004 are not as 
easily solved as a math problem, and we need diplo- 
macy and circumlocution when we deal with our 
political neighbors abroad. To call our problems, 
both foreign and domestic, "challenging'' would be 
an understatement More than ever we need men and 
women who mean what they say, 

Of course, the hope for an honest political candidate 
is a pipe dream; it will never happen. There may be 
no hope tor professional politicians, but what about 
the ubiUqious ' American public" the candidates talk 
about so adoringly? 

It is easy to throw around words like "Bush is a 
moron," or "Democrats are Communist." And 
indeed, I hear various shades of these Iwo extremes 
daily. I'm not here to say whether these opinions arc- 
right or wrong — I am not knowledgeable enough to 
debate anyone on the issues, and I usually refrain 
from getting involved in anything even remotely 
political [Jut if vou are brave enough to offer a polit- 
ical view, I challenge those with political solutions to 
prove it without assaulting vour opponent's personal 
integrity. 

No matter how deplorable one may find the 
President's political agenda, he is not Hitler. No mat- 
ter how much I lillary Clinton is politically appalling, 
she is not Satan One's political beliefs do not a whole 
person make. Political opinions (except in extreme, 
very sad cases) are just one small part of one's per- 

Of course, there isn't some perfect political end-all 
that is possible, but I have faith that normal people 
can employ a level ol reality lost upon our leaders in 
Washington. So instead ol listening to the fast-talkers 
ot Washington, I will ask vou, the reader: give me a 
reason to vote — give me a reason to care when it 
looks like after it is all added up, it equals nothing,

Toast and Jam not passing 
on, merely changing 



Dear Communicator: 

In response to the article on the Opinions Page 
concerning the passing of Toast and Jam, although 
it is true that Toast and Jam has closed the doors to 
business the way it has been done in the past, it is 
not history to be forgotten. The management is 
totally changing the way business is done. The 
Wednesday through Saturday nights were taking 
the attention of the management that would be bet- 
ter spent pursing the original goal of bringing on 
only the best entertainment to Fort Wayne, 

A portion of that goal is exactly a year old now. 
The goal always has been and remains to bring in 
the finest musicians lor intimate concert listening. 
Contrary to what all the articles that have been writ- 
ten on the subject say, (start small), Toast and Jam 
started by getting the best known Folk artist to 
inaugurate our new generation. I ast January Patty 
Larkin was the first "House Concert." Since then 
Toast and Jam has had the pleasure of such acts as 



very exciting concert featuring the local trio, 

Hoochie Mama Gel-down celebrating their new CD 
release Pretty Like a Monster. 

There are several projects in the works at present. 
February 1 st will bring world acclaimed cellist 
Hank Roberts along with one of our old friends 
from New York, Miche Fambro. The very next 
Sunday Toast and Jam welcomes Folk legend 
Claudia Schmidt and rising star, Rachael Davis. 
Instead of a tip jar, tickets an 
these concerts. The nearest i 
outlet is right down the stre

Toast and Jam will soon reopen on a limited basis 
in a similar format as the article described so one 
need not mourn the loss yet. Watch for the return of 
the all-acoustic Open Stage and more in the future. 
Toast and Jam is not dead, only taking a deep breath 
after six years. 
Thanks for your support.

Male perspective 

inadequate to discuss 

abortion 

Dear Communicator, 

I am always amazed when I hear about a male 
debating abortion. Perhaps he could also speak 
about PMS, the pain of childbirth, and menopause. 
Or perhaps he might enlighten us on the difficulties 
of bringing up a child in a fatherless home. 

Abortion should not be an issue of law, it is a per- 
sonal issue. Until Mr. Klusendorf has a uterus, his 
opinion is moot. 



Abotion debate 

unbalanced in morality, 

not talent 



To quote the January 21 Communicator editorial 
"Abortion debate: discussion or sermon?" it truly is 
"too bad the (abortion) debate wasn't more of a bal- 
anced affair." However, I suppose if one were to 
hold a debale on the morality of child abuse or bank 
robbery, chances are it would likely be an "unbal- 
anced" affair. 

Why was this debate "unbalanced"? The 
Communicator wrote it off as a result of 
Klusendorf 's rhetoric, however, this seems less than 
compelling considering I he fact that he tailored his 
speech not only to college students but also to 
mothers, fathers and children in the auditorium. He 
did not use twisted, contusing rhetoric He plainly 
conveyed his view in simple language for all to 

The writer of the editorial also argued it was due 
to the fact that Klusendorf was "preaching to the 
choir." I find this intriguing, considering the fact 
that at the very least, a local Planned Parenthood 
official and this Communicator writer were both in 
the audience. I highly doubt they would consider 
themselves members of any pro-life choir. 

My question is, where were this Planned 
Parenthood official and this Communicator writer 
when it came time to ask questions in the forum 
portion of the debate 7 This furum was opened up 
for any members of the audience to ask their pierc- 
ing questions to Klusendorl and Voors. And yet nei- 
ther the Planned Parenthood official nor the 
Communicator writer chose to rise to the calling of 
asking Klusendorl ,i diffuult question. 

Could it be that there were no holes in his logic, no 
questions that could pierce his case? Now the abor- 
tion supporters are merely sitting hack and com- 
plaining that it was an unfair debate, If they feel so 
strungly about their case, why aren't they trying to 
shoot down Klusendor/'s case and arguments? We 
are a scholarly society. Surely there is one "pro- 
choice" scholar among this group who can do better 
than simply complain. 

Yes, it was an unbalanced debate because while 
one speaker gave a clear, concise case on the 
immorality of abortion, neither the other speaker 
nor the handful of abortion supporters in the crowd 
could find one scholarly argument in support of 
abortion. 

Could it be that there is no logical support for 
abortion? 

Klusendorf and those against abortion asked the 
tough questions last week Can any abortion sup- 
porter venture to do likewise?

Matthews fights the 'devil' inside 

Grammy-nominated solo album worth a listen, not just for DMB fans 



i effort, Matthews carefully hand picked many of the 
sicians featured on the album including Trey Anastsio of 

Phish, who plays guitar on five 

tracks, and long time friend and 

collaborator Tim Reynolds, who 

mMalthews has toured with and 

worked with on many Dave 

Matthews Band albums 

Matthews wrote most ol the lyrics 

and music on "Some Devil" him- 
self or with producer Steve 

"Some Devil" offers a much 
more mellow approach musically 
which is a departure from the 
upbeat funk of the D; 



tent about love, loss, death, and 
the struggle with his own spiritu- 
ality. Instead of songs about the 
lessons learned in life, "Some 
Devil" focuses more on the pain 
and agony of life, which is some- 
thing Matthews knows all too 
well His father died when he was 
very young, and his sister and 
brother-in-law were killed in his 
home country of South Africa ten 
years ago. In the CD cover 
Matthews writes "my father's 
been dead for more than 20 years. 
I still want him to be proud of 

On Sunday, Feb. 8, Matthews 

is up for a Grammy for best male 

rock vocal performance for the first single "Gravedigger, 
which is a song he has played live for almost two years nov, 




of the song, the first is the studio 
and the second is an acoustic version where Matthews is 
accompanied by the strings of the Seatlemusic Group. 
"Gravedigger includes the classic children's song about 
death "Ring Around the Rosie." 

In the title track, "Some Devil," Matthews does some- 
thing different by accompanying 
himself with only the electric gui- 
tar. Again, "Some Devil" is a beau- 
tiful song about the death of a 
loved one where he sings "Some 
devil is stuck inside of me, why 
can't I set it free. I wish I was &lt; ' 



the loneliness 

The second single off the 
album is "Save Me," which is the 
most upbeat song on the album, 
but at close listen you can hear 
Matthews struggle with his own 
beliefs He asks a strange walking 
man to "give me faith, make 
believe" and also asks the scrani 
to "save me." Matthews sings this 
song with so much passion, the 
strain you hear in his voice is des- 
peration for something to believe 



you get me high." This is the happiest you hear Matthews 
on the enitre album. "Before you came, you know, J never 
cared, it's just a game I played," he sings, delightfully, at 
finally finding true love. 

"Some Devil" is not the Dave Matthews Band. Many of 
these songs would not work in that style This album may 
be what Matthews wanted to accomplish with the 2001 
release of 
"Everyday," 
which came 

bit short

The New York: Whax? 




Study: college 
students still 
prefer books to 
new technologies 

OBERLIN, Ohio--(COLLEGIATE PRESSWIRE) 
Early results from a recent study funded by the 
NACS Foundation, the research and education 
arm of the National Association of College 
Stores (NACS), offers .in interesting glimpse 
into 18-22 year olds' attitudes and perceptions 
relating to purchasing course materials. 

Nearly 73 percent of students surveyed pre- 
fer a traditional textbook to an electronic for- 
mat. When shopping for their course materials, 
more than 8^ percent of students head to a 
bricks and mortar bookstore first, 11 percent go 
to a bookstore website and a small 4 percent go 
to another online source. When deciding where 
to shop, students rated price and confidence in 
selecting the correct edition as the most impor- 
tant factors. 

"Although online sales of textbooks and 
alternative textbook formats have created a lot 
of buzz, students prefer the convenience and 
the reliability of traditional books and book- 
stores when it comes to their educational pur- 
chases," said Scott Giesler, executive director of 
the NACS Foundation. 

Student Buying Habits: Tevtbooks and 
Course Materials, was the eleventh in a series of 
college student consumer research studies spon- 
sored by the NACS Foundation. The survey 
was completed in the fall of 2003. The complete 
report will be available in March.

SuperBowl XXXVIII: Pats or Panthers? 




Yes kids, it is th.it time again. That mag-

So, what does that mean? A new 
BiKhviM-.LT tomnuTiuil? Another chance for 
a major network to shamelessly plug them-

Let's face facts. It simply just does not 
matter. Not too many people outside of 
Boston and North Carolina care. 

We've all seen the Patriots here before, 
it's old news. And the Panthers? Well, we all 
know that thev don't belong here anyway. 

So why watch? 

Why waste .i perfect! \ good Sunday on

mediocre team toss around the ball. 

Yeah, 1 bet that you were looking lor a 
reason right about here Well, too bad. 

Fact of the matter is that I will watch

Not to mention that Adam Vinatieri has 
some Super Bowl game experience. 

And hey, I said it last vear at this time, 
as I successfully predicted the Tampa Bav 
buccaneers own Super Bowl win: defense 
wins championships It is that plain and it is 
oh so simple. 

Last week, the Patriots proved their 
defense is the best. 

Sure, the Panthers ha\e done alright for 
themselves, but in the AFC title game, the 
Patriots and Ty Law ran all over the best 
quarterback in the game today.

the dance But still, it is the Super Bowl. 

I won't watch it religiously, like I have 
over the past lew years as the Bucs and 
Rams searched fur glory Yet, I will still 
watch part of it. All of us will. 

Any sports fan who is a sports fan will 
pick up the remote and Imd the game, even 



Or hell, should 1 stop beating around 



still just as big. 

It is still the great American game. 
Oh yeah, taking a line? Pats by 17.

No. 9 PSU outmaneuvers Arnie's Army 




Libero Dustin Sherman and Outside Hitter Josh Collins dive for a spiked ball in a ). 
the Penn State Nittany Lions. 1PFW played the ninth ranked team well, but lost in 



four gan 



The road to a 
National Title ran right 
through IPFW on Saturday, 
Jan. 24, just as coach Amie 
Ball wanted it lo. 

Unfortunately for 
Ball and his "Army," the 
road was for the Nittany 
Lions, and not for the 
Mastodons, who dropped 
to the ¥) ranked Penn State 
squad in four games: 20-30, 
30-24, 29-31, 27-30. 

Penn State plowed 
their way into the Gates 
Center with reckless aban- 
don, taking the first game 
30-21. While Matt 

Zbyszewski reigned 

supreme on the Mastodon 
offense as usual, the Dons 
defense could not find a 
way to stop Penn State 
sophomore Matt Proper, 
who had 11 kills in the 
match. 

IPFW senior Issac 
White led the Don charge in 
the second game with great 
service, backed up with 7 
total kills for the match. 
And for the first time, Penn 
State had no answer, as 
they dropped the second 

Packed with high 
intensity volleys, the third 
match set the tone for the 



remainder of the game'. 
With one-point leads trad- 
ed back and forth through- 
out the game, Penn State 
took over near game end 
and prepared themselves 
for a game point at 24-29. 

Yet, the Dons ral- 
lied back once again. A 
great blocking game from 
Serdar Sikca and strong 
kills by Zbyszewski and 
Mitch Dreisbach rallied 
IPFW back to tie the game 
at 29. But, IPFW failed to 
pick up the loose pieces of 
garbage, where as Penn 
State succeeded in doing 
so. In the end, the Nittany 
Lions took a 29-31 win. 

Heading into the 

final game. Ball had his 

lineup primed for a strong 

. And they did just that. 



Stil 



led 



by 



the 



Zbyszewski/Dreisbach 
attack, the Dons kept the 
game close, up until a 27-29 
match point for Penn State. 
Fittingly, Penn 
State's Kevin Wentzel, who 
led Penn State with 16 kills, 
nailed a key kill to send the 
Dons down on their own 

Zbyszewski had 23 kills in 
the match to pace the Dons. 
Dreisbach had 9 digs and 
Serdar Sikca added seven 
blocks for IPFW.

Cleveland State's scouting 

report for Jan. 26 musl have 
read "Don't let Amy Gearlds

first-half, that plan worked, 
but Gearlds got loose in the 
second half, and helped shoot 
IPFW to an 82-81 win Monday 
night at Goodman / 



the board until just five 
utes remained. 

The senior sniper made 
up for short time, hitting two 
"threes" and a jumper at the

Junior center Verea Bibbs, 
playing near her home, picked 



American Diana Taurasi of up the scoring slack for the 



Dons with nine markers in the 
first half. 

In the second half, 
Gearlds put on a shooting clin-

the game, with about six min- 
utes left, gave IPFW a 67-60 
lead. 

Cleveland State battled 
back into it from the foul-line, 
drawing to within two at 77-75 
at the 4:29 mark. At that point 
in the game, IPFW was whis- 
tled for 14 fouls as compared to 
only six for the Vikings. 

Cleveland State had 
one last chance, down one with 
the ball and 25 seconds left, but 
the Vikings turned it i
