Mastodons book coming 



Commemorative

the 



first Fort Wayne community- 
wide public art project. These 
figures were sponsored by area 
businesses and organizations, 
and arrived to celebrate IPFW's 
40" 1 anniversary. 

It all started when a 
mastodon was discovered two 
miles south of Angola, Indiana. 
It was found by happenstance 
when excavation for a pond 
on Orsie Routsong's farm 
turned up a large bone that 
was uncovered after a hard 
rain. Jack Sunderman, chair of 
the IPFW Geology Department, 
identified the bone as that of a 
mastodon. 

Routsong donated the 
bones to be permanently 
displayed at IPFW. The bones 
have since been in a glass 
display case in Kettler Hall.

Parking lot traffic a problem Co °p education helps 

students find jobs 



Even though traffic flow on 
campus is not too slow com- 
pared to traffic in metropolitan 
areas, by the IPFW standard 
what we have is a "traffic jam." 

At the beginning of the 
semester, the sign "Parking lot 
full, use north lot" was every- 
where. Students who parked 
on the north side of campus, 

didn 



lights on Coliseum Boulevard 
are synchronized to create a 
good traffic flow.

Boulevard. 
"I easily find my parking 
place when I park in the Visual 
Arts Building parking lot at 

Tuesday and Thursday," Than 

said. "Last fall semester, there 

was not only a traffic jam but it 

s also taking too much time 



"The north side is usually 
open. Most of me time Parking 
Garage two has empty park- 
ing places. Peak time is usually 
during a weekday between 7:30 
am to 5:00 pm and peak hours 
are between 4:00pm to 5:00pm 
and 8:00pm to 9:00pm." 

Andrew Copp. a sophomore 
Business Management major 
said, ' Because my classes are 
in Kettler Hall and Neff Hall, 
I parked my car in campus 
garage one. 1 could find my 
parking place within five min- 



"1 encountered a traffic j 
on campus and it took about 
ten minutes to get through. 
They need to have more park- 
ing spots on campus. 

Nguyen is a native of Ho Chi 
Minh City in Vietnam, and he

campus and his hometown

reduce a traffic jam. This is 
not law but it is just habit of 
Vietnamese people. 1 



So, while not all students 
encounter the traffic jams at 
IPFW, one way to avoid them 
completely would be to build 
more parking garages or park- 
ing lots. 

This would save students 
time and frustration when try- 
ing to get to class when they 
cam find a place to park. 

It would also help prevent 
accidents that result from con- 
gested areas of traffic around 
campus.

"Applicants should follow up

Negatives to Positives 



Staff Editorial 



In an ironic twist, un intoxicated IPFW student 
sped through a red light and hit another car killing 
an IPFW professor. Recent statistics say that more 
than 275,000, or nearly 6 percent, of the state's 4.9 
million drivers have at least one DWI conviction. 
On Aug. 8 (ohn Manzer was killed when Daniel 
Epple, with a hlood-alcohol level of 0.17 hit his 
Corvette. According the Indianapolis Star, from 
1993 through 2003 alcohol-related accidents 
accounted for 1,531 deaths in Indiana. 

In 2003. the most recent year for which 
complete data are available. 25 percent of Indiana 



drivers involved in traffic fatalities were legally 
intoxicated, the report said. That was about 
5 percentage points higher than the national 
average. 

An estimated 16, 652 drunk driving deaths were 
recorded in 2001 by the National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration. Drunk driving is one of the 
highest committed violent crimes and it's also the 
most preventable.,.: 

With the threat that federal highway dollars 
would be lost Indiana approved to ban open 
alcohol containers in vehicles and reduced the 



threshold to 0.08. 

The latest ad campaign against drunk driving 
says 'You drink. You drive. You lose.' 

When one drinks and drive's it might better to 
say that everyone involved loses. 

If you are at a party, at the bars, or just on your 
way out for Happy Hour after your last class, 
be prepared. Have a designated driver at your 
disposal, use public transportation, or call a cab.

justifications, all ol which are hornlvini: enough

Nostradamus was born Michel de 
Nostradamus in St. Remi, France in 1503. 
He was the eldest son of Jewish parents 
and forced to convert to Catholicism by 
the Inquisition. Nostradamus grew up 
focusing on his academics, studying foreign 
languages, math, astronomy and astrology 
with his grandfather, Jean. 

He attended (he Uni versify of Mon i pellier 
and began a private practice where he 
attempted and successfully treated plague 
victims in the local area. In 1 534, he married 
and started a family. Ironically, the plague 
that Nostradamus fought so hard to quell 
claimed the lives of his wife and children. 

At this point, he was distressed with all 
that had happened and set forth traveling 



Nostradamus i 
settled in Salon, France to start a new 
family with his wife, Anne Ponsart Gemelle. 
He would go on to have six children, three 
boys and three girls. One year later, he 
began to write his prophecies, in the first 
100 quatraints of "The Centuries". Over 



the next decade, he would complete ten 

On July 1, 1566 Nostradamus offered 
his last and most verified prediction. In 
response to the priest's parting of "Until 
tomorrow," Nostradamus answered: "You 
will not find me alive at sunrise." He 
was found dead in his chamber the next 
morning. 

Many people have attributed events 
such as World War II to his predictions, with 
Nostradamus describing a character very 
similar to Adolf Hitler, barely misspelling 
his name, Hisler. He is also credited by 
some to have predicted President John F. 
Kennedy's assassination, the invention of 
ihe atomic bomb and airplanes. 

Still, addressing any claims that the 
astronomer predicted 9/11 needs to be 
addressed. Researchers like David Emery, 
who wrote "Urban Legends and Folklore", 
have dispelled even the most convincing 
predictions on the event as a hoax. 

Let's look at one of the more popular 
passages that Emery tore apart. "In the 
City of God there will be a great thunder. 
Two brothers torn apart by Chaos, while 
the fortress endures, the great leader will 
succumb", The third big war will begin when 
the big city is burning" • Nostradamus

Functional ceramics on display 



If sludenl life or life in general has 
you stressed out, a trip to the Fort Wayne 
Museum of Art is likely just what you need. 
The relaxing atmosphere and visually stimu- 
lating works of art will reduce your anxiety 
and free you creativity. 

Contemporary Functional Ceramics: 
Transcending Utilitarian Concerns is on 
exhibit now until Oct. 30. This exhibit is 
guest curated by Charlie Cummtngs and 
features around 20 artists. A showing well 
worth ihc student admission price of S3. 

The ceramic pieces range from a few 
inches to approximately four feet tall. The 
unique designs marry form and function 
with an array of firing techniques and mate- 
rials being used by each artist. Porcelain, 
stoneware and terra cotta are a few of the 
materials used by each of them with their 
own look and textu 



Every ceramic piece in this exhibit stands 
oul from the next, making the exhibit a well- 
rounded experience. While some forms may 
be simple, the color of the designs make the 
pieces visually pleasing. 

There are vases with elegant and smooth 
design and even sab and pepper shakers deco- 
rated with detailed surface an Many of these 
pieces display complex forms with distorted 
geometric, shapes. Most of the pieces deserve 
more that just one look. 

Two artists, Kristen Kieffer and Gerard 
Ferrari, make a strong impression with their 
choices of material, color, and over all form. 
Metiers piet i's feature soft, feminine approach 
and Ferrari's art is truly imaginative. 

Kieffer is 33 years old and a full-time studio 
potter and ceramics instructor in Worcester, 
MA. She holds an MFA in ceramics from Ohio 
University and lias been an Art isi- in- Residence 
in (.atlinburg, TN and in the Guldagerganl

Spending this entire column writing about the superior

come to be expected from the Brazilian import. The fact of the

arrived on campus in the fall of 2002. 

At this point, when she will t.itcli l.uira Douglas to become 
the all-time kill leader in school history is just a formality. 
While the record will solidify her as arguably the best ever to

But as much as Souza dominated, having the rest of her 
team step up made this team nearly unbeatable.

For the Fifth straight year,

Attendance for die sixth annual event held at the Hefner Soccer 
Complex totaled 16,373 - a jump of over 1,000 from the 2004

double from the 2004 event - thanks (o higher attendance and

"I'm thrilled,'' IPFW Athletic I lire, tor Mark Pope said. "This is a 
great case and point nl learning a- you go and then remembering 
what you've learned m apply ii I lie next year." 

Since Pope look over as athletic director in Inly 2001, the 
event's attendance totals have risen each year from 2001 to 2003, 
attendance totals sieadiK increased from 8/17 \ to l ).768 and then 
12,546. There was a sharp spike for last year's event as k5.210 
showed up. 

The 2005 Showcase featured 17 Division-1 men's and Women's 
soccer programs - including IPFW - over a dozen local high 
schools and hundreds of youngsters from the Fort Wayne Ciladel 
soccer club. The Hefner Fields Complex boasts 14 playing fields
