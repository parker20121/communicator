Citizenship 

for 

$40 




How safe is you^ 
water? 




Officially becoro- 
ing a United States 
citizen last Thursday. 
Nazif Selimovic de- 
cided a party was in 
order. Some celebrate 
their patriotism with 
fireworks, vhlle other 
consume multiple cases 
of beer. But vrtiat is 
there to celebrate? 

Selimovic has been 
living in the US since 
Jan. 29, 1997, over ten 
years. Since then, he's 
been a legal resident, 
and even before becom- 
ing a permanent resi- 
dent, he Joined the US 
military. 

The only difference 
between nc3w and the 
last decade, is that 
he CBJi vote and travel 
freely. Consider that 



before traveling, Se- 
limovic still must in- 
vest in a passport. 
\^u.ch is an additional 

fee of si'ie.gs. 

The application is 
available at www.usim- 
migrationsupport.org 
for anyone interested. 

"Now I can travel 
outside of the coun- 
try without worrying 
about getting a visa 
approved." added Seli- 

Thougjj the opportu- 
nity to travel is there 
for a US citizen, an 
average of only 20 per* 
cent travel outside the 
country every year. 

What about voting? 

Now that Selijnovic 

the 64 percent of citi- 
zens who can. 

According to QJN.cctn 
there are 7 million im- 



migrants in the United 
States. Hexicans, com- 
prising of almost 70 
that fig- 
ure, contributes to 
the 2.4 percent of our 
country's illegal im- 
migrants, ^.^tjm can nei- 
ther vote nor travel as 
freely. Whether that 
figure is relevant or 
not, politics revolve 
around the issue as 
if it has potential 
to make a significant 
difference . 

So how much does i't 
cost to get a citizen- 
ship , if it is worth 
it? 

Depending on vftieth- 
er one has waited five 
years after becoming a 
pennanent resident, iC 
cost S400. Over three 
hundred dollars of that 
fee is for an applica- 
tion, i^iile S70 is for 



fingerprinting . 

IMs cost is like- 
ly to go up according 
Netscape. com to help 
shorten processing 
time and improve ser- 
When Selimovic 
n to the India- 
napolis office last 
week, there were 30 
other applicants wait- 
ing for their test. 

Out of 100 questions 
in the system, he only 
had to answer six out 
of eight correctly. "To 
become a citizen, 1 was 
asked how many stars 
are on the flag." 

Whether it is to 
vote or travel, the US 
offers opportunities 
for everyone to work 
and support a family, 
an option that deserves 
recognition and some 
celebration- fireworks 
and beer optional.

Researching for aca- 
demic papers is always 
a headache, and now 
that the Internet is 
here to stay, there are 
endless ways to find 
inf ormatior . 

Many students, how- 
ever . make Internet 
research more diff i - 
cult by limiting them- 
selves to websites , 
such as www.gDogle.cotn 
or www.yahoo.coin. TTie 
sites search billions 



of i 



but r 



irrelevant ■ 
research. Users may 
scroll through pages 
of useless results be- 
fore finding what they 
need. While www. schol- 
ar . google . com searches 
only academic jour- 
nals, it includes just 
a fraction of those 
available online and 
many results are only 
accessible to paid sub- 
scribers . Research is 
fastiLT and more effi- 



cient when students use 
wore than just search 
engines and focus on 
academic Web sites like 
the free resources in- 
cluded here.

Six 



degrees \^ 

of Congressman Ron Paul 



By BRANDON HARNISH 



Why do I think that 
Congressman Ron Paul 
" (R-ra) should be the 
next President of the 
United States? Sija- 
ple; because he is the 
greatest Congressman 
in the history of the 
Republic - That's why. 
I know that's a 
pretty bold claim, but 
don't write roe off as 
a kook just yet. Heat 

He has something to 
offer everyone . Are 
you a modem liber- 
al? He stood firm and 
voted against the Iraq 
War viien even Hillary 
Clinton was jumping on 
the bandwagon. But he 
doesn't stop there; he 
has been an outspoken 
critic of costly U.S. 
nation -building and 

reoUess foieisn en- 
tanglements. His op- 
position to U.S. ijupe- 
rialism steins from his 
respect of the Consti- 
tution and his belief 
in a humble foreign 
policy of free trade, 
diplomacy, non-inter- 
vention and going to 
war only with a dec- 
laration from the Con- 
gress. 

Don't like the USA 
PATRIOT act? Neither 
does Ron Paul - he 
voted against it. NAF- 
TA and CAFTA? Forget 
about those sinister 
trade barriers - Gone 
under a Ron Paul admin- 
istration . 

Are you a tradition- 
al conservative? He ' s 
got you covered; In his 
20 years in office, Ron 
Paul has never voted 



for a tax increase. - 
an unbalanced budget , 
or a congressional pay 
raise. He has never 
voted to restrict gun 
ownership and would do 
his damnedest to end 
federal controls on lo- 
cal schools {He wants 
to abolish the Depart- 
ment of Education - you 
know, the kind of stuff 
Republicans used to 
talk about) , 

Sick of the IRS? So 
is Ron Paul - he would 
abolish it and replace 
it with . . . nothing I If 
you're a limited gov- 
ernment Republican 
disgusted with the 



zies who've hijacked 
your party , then Ron 
Paul is your guy. 

Representative Paul ' s 
character as a Con- 
gressman is in a class 
of its own . You ' 11 
never find- a special 

interest group huddled 
outside his office . 
They are not welcome . 
They know that if their 
agenda does nor fall 
within the confines 
of the Constitution, 
there is not a chance 
Ron Paul will vote In 
the affirmative. 



And . 






wondering v^ch Con- 
gressman votes against 
more spending bills 
than any other manber, 
it is the honorable Dr. 
Ron Paul. 

Dr. Paul ' E appeal 
is so broad that I've 
met Europeans v^o wish 
they could vote for Ron 
Paul. Now that's im- 
pressive - regardless 
of what you think about 
Europe. 
From the sign on his 



desk that reads "Don't' 
Steal!' The Government 
Hates Competition , " 
to his nickname "Dr. 
Ho," which was earned 
by voting against any 
bill that he views as 
unconstitutional , Rep- 
resentative Paul has 
been a radiant light 
for liberty in the dark 
halls of the Federal 
Government . 

With Congressional 
and Presidential ap- 
proval ratings plum- 
meting 1 ike s tock 
prices in 1939, it is 
clear that just about 
everybody hates, the 
Federal Government , 
and for good reason. 
"Warfare and welfare" 
has become the slogan 
of that criminal band 
in Washington, Nearly 
everyone is looking 
for change, but in our 
search for change us 
should be prudent. 

Let ' s not be hood - 
winked by grandiose 
and impossible claims 
such as "free health 
care for all." Ron Paul 
represents a voice of 
reason in a government 
gone completely bon- 
kers. 

If any change is to 
be had then Ron Paul 
Diust win the Republican 

age anyone planning on 
voting in the Indiana 
prinary to consider 
Ron Paul. 

Ke is, in the opinion 
of this journalist . 
the most realistic and 
viable hope for peace, 
prosperity and liberty 
In our lifetime.

Iraq leads to political, 
democratic breakdown 



By KATHRYN ANDERSON 
andekn01@ipfw.edu 

Civil wars are erupt- 
ing, and it is not just 
the Sunni against the 
Shi'ite but rather, 
the elected officials 
against the constitu- 
ents. The War in Iraq 
has led to piolitical 
breakdown, demoral- 

izing global images, 
deaths numbering in the 
thousands, and disil- 
lusionment of American 
democracy. 

President Bush , the 
self -proclaimed "de- 
cider" of our hcroeland, 
has transformed or dis- 
regarded American in- 
stitutions and ideals - 
by ignoring intelli- 
gence . Congress , and 
practically the entire 

The American gov- 
ernment can no longer 
function as a prime 
example of how a suc- 
cessful and affluent 
democracy should func- 
tion. Virtually all de- 

tarily with little or 
no compromise, v^iereas 
the majority of the na- 
tion opposes said deci- 

How can one even ex- 
pect the Iraqi justice 
system to operate under 
the virtues of equality 
and integrity lAen the 
American justice sys-

cized and subjected to 
countless acts of cor- 
ruption , and v^en the 
voice of the People has 
been regarded as irrel- 
evant by the will of 
the Elite? 

The democratic spir- 
it of America is erod- 
ing \vM,lst the broken 
government of Iraq is 



attanpting to be re- 
constmcted into a de- 
iSoctacy-.--- ■ ", " 

It shoul'd be noted that 
one cannot overlook the 
positive repercussions 
that have resulted from 
the U,S. - led invasion 
of Iraq. 

Our generation has 
had the opportunity to 
witness and honor an 
outpour of courageous 
men and women serving 
their countrywho were 
able to capture a ty- 
rannical dictator, who 
was dismantled and ul- 
timately executed with 
due process. 

It can also be noted 
that a foreign ter- 
rorist attack has not 
occurred on U.S. soil 
since the September U 
attacks . 

On the bleaker side of 
the spectrum, the evils 
of war have drastical- 
ly outweighed any good 
that will coma of it. 
After over four years, 
there is little if any 
semblance of stabil- 
ity in the nation of 
Iraq, needless to say a 
peaceful resolution. 

Although the U.S. 
is yet to see another 
poBt-9/11 terrorist 
attack as mentioned 
earlier, glo"bal acts of 
terror have increased 
by nearly four-fold in 



the course of a year 
according to the Wash- 
ington Post. 

Iraq has also been 
labeled a "breeding 
ground" for terrorists 
and was accountable 
for nearly half of 
last year's total n 
bet of attackfi', which 
is a bit counterprc 
ductive lAen the goal 
of the Iraq w 
iB^rovB-the quality of 
life domestically and 
globally. 

Now. one could i 
tionalize that troop 
occupations and surg-

helping to alleviate 
such tensions and to 
promote amity of both

However, quantity has

"Your average com-

But is this "support" 
only conditional? Are 
the troops only heroes 
while in combat? These 
brave individuals do 
deserve praise fron the 
country, and the treat- 
ment or lack thereof 
that they receive in 
their own homeland is 
appalling and . quite 
frankly, unpatriotic. 

The War in Iraq has

people would be quick 
to label a person as 
"unpatriotic" if they 
prartice their right 



to freedom of speech by

is patriotic to allow a 
"decider" to strip away 
institutional civil 
liberties and to turn 
the concept of denioc - 
racy on its ear. 

It is patriotic to 
support the brave in-

it is also acceptable

"I believe that we should 
stay in Iraq-there is^still a lot 
more we could do there. We also 
need to help create a more sta- 
ble and accepted government. In 
addition, without our troops to 
help protect those people who 
write the laws and improve the I 
lives of the Iraqi people, the ter- 
rorists would just rise again and 
plunge the country into further 
turmoil-which could and most 
likely would once again threaten 
the US, its citizens, and the rest 
of the world. We must stay if not 
for us, than for the rest of the 
world." 

-Erik Murray, freshman 



"I believe the war in (raq 
has gone on for far too long. 
And ) think that the United 
States already have enough of 
their own problems without 
looking for more. 

It is ultimately the US 
citizens paying the price of the 
war. So many young soldiers 
have lost their lives in this \ 
They never will be able to get 
married and start a family. 
Many soldiers are barely out of 
jhigh school. And some soldiers 
are never able to see their ba- 
bies for a first time. Too many 
children will be forced to grow 
up without one of their parents 
;becauseof the war. 

I do support our troops 
and all of the men and women 
serving in the military deserve 
the utmost support and praise. 
But this war has gone on for 
almost four and a half years and 
it doesn't seem like much have 
been accomplished. Who knows 
if there is an end in sightl I

Protecting the 
president... 
and liis image? 

The Secret Service has protected US 
presidents from bodily harnn, but does 
it also protect him from criticism? 



By DOUG SCHMIDT 
schmdnOieipfw.edu 



The Secret Service 
has protected the pres- 
ident for over a centu- 
ry. In 1975, the Secret 
Service stopped Charles 
Hanson disciple Lynette 
"Squeaky" Fronwe from 
assa ss inatin g Presi- 
dent Ford. In 1981, Se- 
cret Service agent Tim- 
othy McCarthy shielded 
President Regan during 



of volunteer 
demonstrators called 
"rally squads," 

The rally squads use 
their patriotic signs 
and banners as a shield, 
hiding the demonstra- 
tors from the media. If 
the demonstrators de- 
cide to yell their mes- 
sage, the rally squads 
are to drown them out 
with chants of, "USA! 
USA! USAI" 

The manual also cau- 
tions \Jhite*House staff 
to avoid physically 



sassi- "Ask the local police department to des- 
attempt iQfi^te 3 protest area where the dem- 
■by John onstfators Can be placed, preferabty not 
Hinck- in view of the event site or motorcade 
i_ ^ y ■ route." 

-White House manual 



Today, 
the 

White House staff pro- 
tects President Bush 
against a different 
kind of threat; politi- 
cal activists. 

Unearthed during a 
recent lawsuit by the 
American Civil Liber- 
ties Union, the Presi- 
dential Advance Manual 
is the Bush Adminis- 
tration's official in- 
structions on how the 
White House staff is to 
control the crowds at 
the president's public 
appearances. The manu- 
al begins by describing 
how event tickets are 
to be distributed. 

The seats closest to 
the stage are to be re- 
served for "groups ex- 
t r»nely supportive of 
the Administration," 

Ticket holders are to 
be checked for protest 
signs before the J enter 
the 



harming the danonstra- 
tors. However, the con- 
cern is bad press, not 
safety, "...the denon- 
strators want a physi- 
cal confrontation. 

Do not fall into their 
trap ! ... decide if the 
solution Vitiuld cause 
more negative public- 
ity than if the dem- 
onstrators were simply 
left alone." 

Pfilltical demonstra- 
tions ate also not al- 
lowed outside of the 
venue, "nie manual in- 
structs White House 
staff and the Secret 
Service to "ask the lo- 
cal police department 
to designate a protest 
area where the demon- 
strators can be placed, 
preferably not in view 
of the event site or 
motorcade route." 

Americans i 



any folded cloth 
they might have con- 
cealed. Ihe only tijne 
that demonstrators can 
be safely ignored is 
when the media does not 
notice them. 

However, if the dem- 
■ ii'Ttrators are carcy- 

irjp, signs, shouting or 
■•■ hvrwise drawing at- 
■■■niion to themselves, 

" iL tion needs to be 
taken ijiinediately to 
minimize the demon- 
strator's effect." 

Any demonstrators who 
make it inside are to 
be blocked by groups 



including an^eed the right 



express their politi- 
cal views, to assesnble 
peacefully and to peti* 
tion the government to 
right its wrongs, and 
President Bush has not 
stopped than. 

Americans are still 
free to protest , as 
long as they remain in- 
visible.

"I do"' for now- 
Marrying Young 

Young love can be passionate and seem 

like it will last forever, but what happens if 

you get married too young? 



By TIA FRANKS 



college career two 
weeks later. 

The remaining de- 
tails are not as 



As the years have 
passed at IPFW (for 
this is my fifth and 
final year as an un- 
dergrad student) I 
have become increas- 
ingly aware of the 
young students who 
have chosen to take 
the plunge into mar- 
riage. 

My awareness is 
likely the cause of 
my own marriage and 
divorce at a signifi- 
cantly young age. So 
that you can better 
understand my con- 
clusion. I am choos- 
ing to include some 



.rapon 



the 



fact 



lal 



but 



beneficial informa- 
tion about myself. 

As a Junior in high 
school I found my- 
self in an unexpected 
whirlwind of love and 
marriage. My seri- 
ous boyfriend of the 
time, who was in fact 
older than I. popped 
the question two 
years into our rela- 
tionship. At the time 
I was overjoyed and 
completely oblivious 
to the changes that 
I would go through in 
the up coming years. 
With my parents' full 
approval I was mar- 
ried the August af- 
ter I graduated high 
school and began my 



ige I wi 
liver. The 
that I am not now the 
same person that I 
was then and neither 
is my ex-spouse. 

The fear that I have 
now about young mar- 
riage is the misun- 
derstanding that life 
and people do change 
drastically as you 
get older. It seems 
that many young peo- 
ple believe that love 
is a contract to hap- 
and long last- 

celatlonshlpB. 
lybe It Is for 
some. For others how- 
ever, love can change 
with experience and 
time. The epidemic 
which has overcome 
our generation is the 
belief that we know 



pinef 

ins 



the person we are 
forever. 

Without life expe- 
rience beyond high 
school and col 
lege what do we re 
ally know? The fad 
is that as we con 
tinue to grow and 
learn through 
lege we become 
evolved from our 
mer selves . 

I certainly know 
that I am not the 
person I used to be 
five years ago and as 
I continue to experi- 
ence life I hope that 
I will be even more 
different five years 
from now. The issue 

of youna tnorciaae 
Is not about loving 
another person, but 
about knowing who you 
are and who you want 
to become.

Halloween comes early this year 

Rob Zombie's remake of the horror classic is just what the series needed 



BY ROBIN CROWELL 



Rob Zombie has re- 
leased two films so far 
in his career, the fan 
favorite "House of 1000 
Corpses" and the widely 
appreciated "The Dev- 
il's Rejects." 
With such fiLns under 
his belt . one would 
expect Zombie to at- 
tack something of his 
own creation as opposed 
to one of the clas- 
sics, the greats, and 
the very framework for 
much of modem horror 
cinema . Zombie ' s re- 
make of 

"Halloween" hit the- 
aters on August 31st 
and fans of both Zombie 
and the John Carpen- 
ter's original "Hal- 
loween" film will not 



be disappointed. 

The film begins with 
providing insight into 
Michael Myers ' (the 
masked assailant famed 
in the original film) 
childhood. Growing up 
in the modest town of 
Haddonfield, Illinois, 
Myers was introduced 
to the cruelties of the 
world from birth. A 
dead father, an abusive 
step dad, and a strip- 
per mother (played by 
Zombie ' s wife , Sherri 
Moon) aid to less than 
admirable external 
surroundings. Acts of 
violence are noticed by 
school officials and 
are ignored by family, 
staunchly in denial of 
any problems concern- 
ing young Michael. 

This insight into 

one of today's most 

famous 'mov- 




gives fans of 
the original 






thoE 






to the film 
it makes for 
a more rounded 
character than 
some large 
brute jaunting 
around wield - 
Ing a butcher 
knife. Zom- 
bie's visions 
for young Mi- 
chael resem- 
ble charac- 
teristics of 



films, provided 
the time frame 
{1970s horror 
lore) and Sher- 
ri Moon shak- 
ing her good - 
ies around (IE 
Baby Firefly in 
'House of 1000 
Corpses ' and 
'The Devil's 
Rejects") as a 
stripper. Not 
only is Sher- 
ri Moon in the 
film (speak- 
ing of aspects 
from Zombie's 
other films) . 
but also other 
cameos include 
Sid Haig (Cap- 
tain Spauldixig 
in "House' and 'Devil's 
Rejects'). Bill Hoseley 
(Otis in the two afore- 
mentioned films) , Les- 
lie Easterbrook {^toth- 
er Firefly in 'Devil's 
Rejects) and Ken Force 
(Charlie Altamont in 
'Devil's Rejects'). 

Part two of the film 
(metaphorically speak- 
ing) includes Michael's 
life and times in a 
mental institution; an 
aspect of the film just 
barely alluded to in 
the original. In this 
renake . Zombie makes 
this a significant part 
of the film, also div- 
ing deeper into Dr. 
Loomis and Michael ' s 
relationship. 

Events occurring in 
the institution make 
t-Iichael seem less like 




I more like 
an individual , torn 
from the confines of 
a normal childhood and 
thrust into a world of 
depravity. 

The only area of the 
film containing as- 
pects from Carpenter's 
original is the final 
segment, returning to 
Haddonfield to find his 

Strode. 

Many similarities 
arise through viewing 
this portion, the same 
brutality included . 
Many ccsiqjlaints can be 
filed to this aspect . 
Not only does Zombie 
truly make this film 
his own, he leaves many 
of the original prob - 
lems until the end of 
the film. Some would 



say that he trashed 
the film, but re- 
ally he just took 
a story that he 
loved , added some 
detai 1 . answe red 
seme questions, and 
provided a horrific 
journey through the 
eyes of a psycho- 
path. And that is 
exactly what this 
're-invention' of 
"Halloween" is, 
a way to see \ihst 
happened through 
the eyes of the 
killer himself. 

Aside from 
some qualms with 
the middle of the 
film dragging on 
and such. I give 
the film an 8 out of 
10 being a fan of the 
original "Halloween" 
and Zombie ' s movies 
yet strongly disliking 
the numerous remakes 
in horror movies as of 
late. It seems as if 
the only horror flicks 
that crane out anynwre 



pom ("Saw, " "Hostel . " 
etc.) so vAienever Zom- 
bie has a movie coming 
out, it's like a breath 
of fresh air. 

This reinvention may 
not sit well with fans 
that saw the origlJial 
in theaters , but for 
those with an open mind 
and a respect for hor- 
ror cinema and what 
it's supposed to be. 
this nravie is definite- 
ly a wiiiner.

and shows that they can 
be just as messed up, 
neurotic, or unhappy as 
the rest of the world; 
maybe even more. 

Overall . this book 
was an interesting read 
with a _ plotline that 
draws the reader in. 
and there is never a 
dull nonent.

Ladies , if you are 
looking for a book that 
is an entertainina and 
easy to get thrcjugh 
then I would suggest 
"Wednes- ■■

Nichols, 
I picked 
this book . 



is a book about three 
girlfriends: a kin- 
dergarten teacher, a 
starving artist, and a 
chef who live on the 
East Coast and how their 
worlds turn upside down 
vrfien all their wishes 



"The author brings

women face on an 
every day basis..." 



novel with 
added hu- 






up 



the 



haul 



other day for a little 
light reading, and it 
was the perfect fix. 

The author brings hu- 
mor into issues women 
face on an every day 
basis: jobs that don't 
pay the bills, friends 
that drive you c razy , 
and of course, men. It 



twist at the end. So, 
if you want a book with 
a little bit of every- 
thing to get you through 
the school week, than I 
would definitely choose 
"Wednesday Night Witch- 
es"- it's a great Book 
at a price that college 
students can afford.

Jello Fight, Anyone? 



BY ALLYSOM WIHEBAR 

Five friends have

her footsteps and be-

"We are all social 
and wanted to organize

out and socialize . 
Ihere are games . con-

try as well. 

(We all know how 
free food goes on a 
college campus I ) 
A: What were your ideas 
in setting up such a 
large event with your 
friends? 

R; We really just want- 
ed to get something 
that would involve 
of the students. I 
had planned individual 
events every week last 
year, but some kids al- 
ways had classes. With 
a weeklong event , mote 
people are likely to 
show up. 

A: What does it take 
to plan something like 
this? 

R: It takes a lot of 
planning and timing, 
but with the help of 
my friends and my expe- 
rience frctn last year. 



it's going well. 
A; Can the students ex- 
pect more events from 
the RA Divas in the fu- 
ture? 

R: Oh Yeah! Our goal is 
to have two big events 
each semester. We plan 
on doing another "Back 
to School Bash" for the 
spring semester this 
year. 

The RA Divas were 
really excited about 
kicking back with the 
rest of the student 
body. The activities 
sponsored by the 5tA Di-

Need a taste of colorful food and culture? 



Dash-In downtown has flare for flavorful and fun food rich in flare 



By JESSIE RUCKHAN 
ruckjlOagipfw.edu 



I miss blB'city liv- 
ing. The tree lined 
streets that are full 
of bustle and noise 
and people walking by 
from all walks of life, 
with endless stories to 
tell. Then there is 
the food that is typi- 
cally offered. Endless 
choices and options for 
the health-conscious, 
or those who just get 
tired of Midwestern 
fare. 

Give me some colorful 
food , for crying out 

Out of frustration 
of scsnething . new and 
different. I took the 
advice of a number of 
friends . and tried 
Dash- In, located at 814 
South Calhoun Street in 
downtown Fort Wayne . 
After finally finding 
a parking^ space around 
tie comer and down 
the street , I set off 
(talking and as 1 turned 
the comer ontb felhouri

I had been transported 
to Chicago, 

The streets were lined 
with leafy trees that 
shaded grateful vintage 
brick buildings i4ule 
the soft late-suraner 
breeze ruffled my hair. 
The mood had been set, 
and as I neared the 



Dash-in, the caf^-style 
tables and chairs that 
lined the sidewalk put 
me into mind again of 
Chicago, or a borough 
of New York. 

This was indeed a 
little slice of beauty 
in an otherwise drab 
day filled with school 
and work, 

Unsure of what to do 



The Dash- In

asked the friendly, 
smiling cashier if I 
could sit outside. "Of 
course" was her reply, 
and so I ventured back 
to a table tucked into 
a niche in the build- 
ing. 

Ordering the grilled 
Mediterranean sandwich 
with chips (it was late 
in their business day, 
and the other, more de- 
sirable options were 
gone) , I sat back to 
watch life pass through 
the door of "the

Diaries of the intrepid dater 

part deux 



BY JESSIE RUCKMAN 
rudcjl 01@ipfw.edu 

I met Blake at a house 
party my freshman 
year of college. He 
was tall and attrac- 
tive, but I had no par- 
ticular interest in 
him. I have no idea 
i^y, but the chemistry 
wasn't there, and like 
the book says, I just 
wasn't that into hljii. 
My good friend was , 
however, and that was 
more than fine by me. 
Life went on. and Blake 
and I stayed friends - 
distant friends who 
typically argued over 
everything when we were 
together, and honestly 
the guy drove me nuts 
most of the time. 

On the other 
hand, Blake was' deter- 
mined and was sure to 



let me know he was at- 
tracted. I of course 
thought he was joking 
since he had been 'dat- 
ing a friend of mine 
off and on for a , few 
years. And besides, I 
was busy pursuing many 
other avenues of life. 
I had moved to 
Texas for a year to get 
away from Indiana and 
"experience life in an- 
other part of the coun- 
try. I learned how to 
drink tequila without 
gagging, dance the two- 
step with real cowboys 
(Uid how to properly 
watch a Longhom foot- 
ball game with a flask 
tied to my leg, 

playtime 
oug^. and 
it was back to reality 
for me. And in that 
reality I had no degree 
and no real career ex- 






perience, so when it 
was time to come back 
to Earth, I returned to 
my roots in Indiana. 
And there was Blake. 

It vias so re- 
freshing to see a fa- 
miliar face among a sea 
of strangers. It was 
as though the time I 
was gone was used to 
completely turn my home 
inside out, and while I 
grappled for my place 
in the world, BlaJte wa6 
a constant figure. Al- 
though his presence was 
cooifortlng, we still 
remained platonic. 

Until that 
night, of course. Lone- 
liness had consumed me 
nfor the final time, and 
as Blake and I sat a^ 
his apartment, talking 
well into the nigjit , 
he made his 1X1 ve and 
I didn't say no. And 



before I knew it, Blake 
and I were the nev,'e^t 
members of tVie 'well ■ 
that-was-fun-now-what- 
do-we-do'^.cluh- 

For the first 
few weeks, things r^- 
nHined delightfully 
string- free and we saw 
each other v^en the 
time suited or one of 
us was in need of a 
scratch for that par- 
ticular itch. It was 
blissfully uncorapli - 
cated , and I , in my 
relaxed and blissful 
state. contemplated 
placidly how long this 
wave would last before 
one of us screwed it up 
beyond repair. 

And it wasn't 
long before that self 
fulfilling prophecy 
came true in a big. 
Jerry Springer way.

Men's soccer opens season with a win 



Courtesy of the IPFW 
Athletic Department 



Freshman midfielder 
JorgeRamirez got the 
lone goal of the match 
in the first half as 
IPFW topped St. Jo- 
seph's College, i-0 on 
Friday night at the He- 
fner Soccer Complex. 

Ramirez ' goal came 
half way through the 
opening half. Sopho- 
more midfielder Chris 
Dolinski sent Ramirez 
out wide with a perfect 
ball. Ramirez toed up 
a missile from about 15 
yards out that found 



its way into the upper 

right hand comer of 

the net- 

IPEW had a number of 

chances in the match. 

and drew iron on three 
separate occasions. 

Dolinski had one of 
the better opportu- 
nities in the match. 
With just over three 
minutes remaining reg- 
ulation , St . Joseph ' s 
keeper Alex Making slid 
out at the top of the 
18 to nake a save. The 
ball popped up in the 
air. 

Dolinski gathered 
it in, side stepped 
a crowd of Fuims and 
tried to park a shot 



just under the cross- 
bar . Unf oirtunately , 
his blast was off by 
just Inches. 

The ' Dons out shot 
the Pumas (0-1-D) 18- 
10, with eight of IPFW 
shots on goal, Makin 
turned back seven. 
IPFW goal keeper Josh 
Howell made two saves 
in the match for his 
first collegiate win.

"Who's going to make the next kill?" The volleyball coach doesn't 
honestly want... Or does she? Like every sport, volleyball has 
it's own language vrfiich may be very confusing for casual specta- 

Here are seven volleyball terras to leacn before attending a 

1. ACE; An outrageous serve that the opponent finds impossible to 
return naking the crowd go wild. 

2. AITACK/SPIKE: An offensive move to end the rally by scoring a 

3. KILL: An attack that hanmers the ball to the floor on the 
opponent's side for a point and some bragging rights. 

&lt;i. HAIiY: From the tljne of the serve until the play is ended with 
our 'Dons taking the point. 

5. SIDE OUT: When the crowd razzes the opponent's team so bad that 
they lose the rally and turn over the serve to the Lady 'Dons. 

6. SPRAWL; Literally what it sounds like — a desperate attempt 
to save the ball from hitting the floor. Often times these leave 
pretty awesome looking battle wounds; just ask the players. 

7. TIP: A tricky dink over the net used to catch the opponent off 

Attend the next wonen's volleyball game Sept. 7 at 7 p.m. Cheer 
the 'Dons to victory, and show off your school spirit along with 
the new lingo I
