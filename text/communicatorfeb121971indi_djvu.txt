A. FEE referendum 



Results of ihe recently pro- 
posed activities fee referendum 
have been noted, A majority of 
Ihe voters favored a uniform six 
dollar fee for all students. 

Only 459 ballots were re- 
'urned, (All sludenls received 
ballots.) 62 of Ihe voters are 
enrolled in 1 to 4 credit hours, 
83 voters are enrolled in 5 to 8 
hours, and 314 are full, time stu- 
dents. 313 students favored the 
six dollar fee and 143 favored 
using ihe presenlsystem. 

The poor voting response 
could be explained by two foc- 
rorir, Full-time students didn't 
vole because they couldn't be 
hurt by the proposal. Part-time 
sludenls lack a sense of com- 
— nity with the campus, so 



they didn't vote. 

The fallow-up of this 
referendum will be the pre- 
sentation of proposals to the 
student assembly. Next, 

open hearings will be held, 
February 17 at 9:00 P.M. 
in roam 178, concerning the 
topic of activities fee reform.

on that day a sickening layer 
of ice covered the Regional 
Campus and made any form of 
travel extremely risky. 

Although only three 
minor accidents were reported 
to safely end security, there 
were undoubtedly many more 
"fender-benders" who never 
made it to the building. The 
sidewalks were like n tobog-

FEDERAL 
LOWERS 



Dr. Dwight Henderson 
of ihe history department 
has just received news of 
the publication of his book, 
Courts For The New Na tion. 
The history of the lower fed- 
eral courts from 1790 to 18" 
Ol is explained and traced 
in the 165 page book. 

The origin of these low- 
er federal courts is present- 
ed and discussed. Where 
this type of a court system 
came from and iheir speci- 
fic origins and provision in 
the Constitution is the main 
body of the book/Although 
the period from 1790 to 180' 
is relatively short, Dr. Hen- 
derson digs deeply into the 
seemingly minor but defina- 
tely importnnt areas which 
these courts cover. 

For example, the book 
goes iuto the Constitutional

■ the t 



-ity 



of lower federal 
explains the origin of the 
idea of these courts from 
ihe colonial coorla (whose 

branch of the French court 
aytoa,). 

The question of the 
staffing of these courts is 
also presented. After the 
first Congress established 
the courts (by the Lower 
Court Act of 1789), the pcr- 
soacll (w.q. federal mar- 
shal Is from the district 
courts and the district attor- 
neys) were to be appointed 
by the President with the 
approval of the Senate. This 
situation illustrates iho de- 
tails which make history 
very interesting: the nephew 
of George Washington was 
recommended for a position 
of district attorney but 
George Washington refused 
to appoint him. When ques- 
tioned about this, the first 




lilt. ItHSIMRSOS 

President uf the United 
Stales made it quite clear 
that he did not believe in 
pulling his relatives in gov- 
ernment positions. 

In concluding his book, 
Dr. Henderson made the 
point that the establishment 
of lower federal courts were 
an essential point of estab- 
lishment of the central gov* 

though these are still argu- 
ments of whether or not 
these courts were and urc 
functional, this book does 
not necessarily make speci- 
fic value judgement or such. 

Dr. '■lenders on said that 
he really enjoyed writing 
his book-an extension of a 
doctoral dissertation. He 
was able to "revise this dis- 
sertation and lengthen il to 
its necessary length into the 
resulting book.

science magazines and law 
journnls will be reviewing

When Mike Meyer walk- 
ed back to the Tree lot to 
drive home, he found thot he 
was the ohjeel of another 
frce-1-.r rnr harclurv. 

Sometime between noon 
and 1:30 last Wednesday 
someone had jacked up his 
car around the door of the 
passenger side and stole 
two tires and wheels. 

The largest amount 



of damage came when ihe 
thief kicked over- the jack 
letting the car fall onto its 
frame. The doors were coved 
in, the axles were ruined, 
and possibly the frame was 
bent. This expensive thefl 
and damage occurred when 
Mike's car was parked be- 
hind the hedge toward the 
soccer field.

When a series of intermittent 
blasts of the fire alarm (klaxon) 
is sounded, the building is to 
be evacuated i mmediately by 
the nearest door. All students, 
faculty, and staff should be 
instructed to collect personal 
belongings within eacy reach—
