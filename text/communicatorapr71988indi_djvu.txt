Decision rendered 



DeFonso wins tenure appeal 



By LILLIAN R. LYON 
Editor-in-Chief 

Lenore DeFonso, assistant professor 
of psychological sciences, has been 
granted tenure following her appeal of 
Chancellor Thomas P. Wallace's 
decision to deny her tenure. 

DeFonso was notified Wednesday, 
March 30, with a letter of confirmation 
of recommendation to the Board of 
Trustees from the office of the 
chancellor, Wallace also notified 
DeFonso in person of the approval of 
tenure on March 30. The approval 
followed Wallace's denial of tenure 
and promotion, a decision which 
DeFonso appealed. 

"Chance/lor Wallace said 
the vote from Panel D was a 
'negative' 5-5 for promotion 
and a 'positive' 7-3 for ten- 
ure, and, therefore, he 
cannot offer either one. ' '

DeFonso submitted her case for 
tenure and promotion in the fall of 
1986, in her penultimate, or sixth, year 
on campus. This is Wallace's first 
year at the IPFW campus. 

The tenure review went before the 
department of psychological sciences 
primary committee, a personnel 
committee, on Oct. 15, 1986. The 
committee voted 8-1 in favor of both 
tenure and promotion. 

The case moved to the chair of the 
department, Dennis Cannon. Cannon 
also decided for both tenure and 
promotion in DeFonso's favor. 

The decision then moved to the area 
committee from the School of Arts and 
Sciences, which met on Oct, 29, 1986. 
By a vote of 3-2, DeFonso was again 
approved for tenure and promotion. 



This decision then went before the 
dean of the former department of 
science and humanities,- Kenneth L. 
Stevenson. Stevenson met with 
DeFonso on Nov. 5, 1986, and made a 
recommendation for tenure only. 

The next stop was with Panel D, the 
Purdue University committee. The 
panel met on Dec. 10, 1986, and voted 
5-S for tenure and promotion but 7-3 in 
favor of tenure alone. 

According to the faculty senate 
document regarding tenure. Document 
DS 76-20, a majority vole is a positive 
recommendation. 

Howevrt", when the issue came be- 
fore Wallace for his recommendation 
to the Board of Trustees, Wallace 
turned down both tenure and 
promotion. 

"Chancellor Wallace said the vote 
from Panel D was a "negative" 5-5 for 
promotion and a 'positive' 7-3 for 
tenure, and, therefore, he cannot offer 
either one," DeFonso said in an 
interview in March, referring to 
Wallace's letter dated Dec. 17, 1986, 

In response to Wallace's denial, an 
informal appeal in DeFonso's behalf 
was initiated by the primary com- 
mittee on Jan. 5, 1987. Cannon and 
three primary committee members 
met with Wallace on Jan. 14, 1987, to 
discuss whether Wallace was re- 
considering his denial. On Jan. 28, 
19B7, Cannon contacted Wallace to ask 
if a decision had been made. On Feb. 4 
Wallace informed them he had not 
changed his decision, 

DeFonso met with Wallace on Feb, 
27. 1987, following her request. 
"Chancellor Wallace said he could not 
give specific reasons for his decision," 
DeFonso said. According to DeFonso's 
grievance form, which was filed April 
10, 1987. Wallace "initially refused to 
give any reasons for his decision, 
stating that in some places the 
reasons t&gt;ecome the basis for sub- 
sequent lawsuits." DeFonso said that 



Tenure and promotion 

Process outlined 



Although differences exist between 
Indiana and Purdue Universities, both 
use similar criteria of research for 
scholarship, teaching and service in 
awarding tenure or promotion. 

Warren Worthiey, dean of the School 
of Engineering, said, "Scholarship is 
the sharing of creativity with 
colleagues. The scholarship must be 
worthy of being published in a re- 
search or pedagogical journal. It must 
be of interest to others, and you must 
get the appropriate publisher to print 
it for you." The engineering dean then 
outlined appropriate engineering 
publications for the disciplines within 
the school. 

Worthiey also said scholarship in- 
cluded the ability to attract financial 
support for a faculty member's 
research, such as grants or contracts. 

All deans questioned mentioned the 
importance of being published in 
refereed journals. A refereed journal 
is one in which outside experts 
evaluate the work to be published. 
"Having a journal refereed gives you 
quality control over the paper flow. It 
protects you from a paper that is 
worthless to the profession," Worthiey 
said. 

But simply being published in a 
refereed journal may not impress 
George Bullion, dean of Business and 
Management Sciences. "There could 
be a journal that is technically 
refereed, but the selection process is 
not very selective. There is a lot of 
difference between a journal that has 
a 10-percent turn-down rate and one 
that has a 60% or 70% percent 
turn-down rate." 

Julius Smulkstys, dean of Arts and 
Sciences, said that by having refereed 
journals, "We get a relatively ob- 
jective standard as to the value of the 
work." 

But research can also mean creative 
endeavor, a more meaningful defini- 
tion to faculty in the fine and per- 
forming arls, James D. Alor, acting 



dean of Fine and Performing Arts, 
mentioned that a pianist should give 
performances and recitals and not 
publish articles. Ator also said he did 
have people engaged in research. 

The second criterion is leaching. 
Smulkstys said student, peer and self 
evaluations are used to measure 
teaching. Self-evaluation is the sub- 
mission of all pertinent course 
materials, Smulkstys said. Peer evalu- 
ations are rarely used in Arts and 
Sciences. 

The final criterion is service. Every 
dean defined service as service to the 
university, to the profession and to the 
community. Service to the university 
could involve developing the cur- 
riculum or serving on a faculty com- 
mittee. Service to the profession could 
mean joining a professional organiza- 
tion and helping to set the future 
course of the faculty member's 
discipline. Service to the community 
could involve consulting in an area 
relevant to the faculty member's 
expertise. 

Smulkstys defined tenure as a life- 
long commitment to employ a person. 
"The purpose of tenure is to 
give (acuity members employment 
security so that faculty can pursue 
research and leaching without any 
inhibitions as to the faculty member's 
view and ideas. It gives academic 
freedom to faculty to pursue the 
search for truth." 

Worthiey explained that IPFW 
followed the American Association of 
University Professors' recommend- 
ations. Each new faculty member has 
a seven-year probationary period. 
During the sixth year the individual's 
case for tenure is considered. The 
case will t&gt;e considered by various 
committees, including the department 
committee, the school committee and 
the campus committee. The depart- 
ment chair, dean and chancellor will 
also make recommendations. 

See TENURE, page 3 



Wallace told her he was "not com- 
, fortable" with her research. However, 
DeFonso argued that according to 
Document SD 76-20, requirements for 
tenure are demonstrating excellence 
in one, though normally two, of three 
areas: teaching, research and service, 

DeFonso pointed out that she had 
met the criteria for two of these re- 
quirements. From 1979 lo 1985 she 
served two three-year terms with the 
State Board of Examiners in Psy- 
chology, the licensing and regulating 
board for Indiana. 

For five years, DeFonso was 
practicing clinical psychologist, and 
tor 21^ years she worked at St, 
Francis College. In addition, she was 
at Park Center for 2Vi years as 
director of training before she came lo 
IPFW in 1981, where she has served 
on several committees. 

DeFonso pointed out that she is a 
clinician, and clinicians do litlle 
research. Cannon, DeFonso said, 
wrote a letter to Wallace explaining 
this. 

Wallace told DeFonso he would 
reconsider his decision if she 
submitted a five-year research plan, 
the grievance form states. DeFonso 
said she did so on March 10, 1987, and 
when she received no response from 
Wallace, she called his office lo see if 
he had made a decision, DeFonso re- 
ceived a letter the next day, March 19, 
which, she said, stated only that 
Wallace had discussed the plan wilh 
others but did not refer to the quahty 
or acceptability of the plan. 

"/ felt that it realty sort of 
affirmed the faculty com- 
mittee role in the tenure 
process. "

DeFonso then filed her faculty 
grievance form, staling she was 
denied tenure despite the absence of 
specific reasons for doing so. Her 
points in the grievance follow. 

1. The denial refutes the tenure 
process as outlined in SD 76-20 and 
therefore is negated. 

2. She has shown excellence in two 



of the three required areas, with sup- 
porting evidence, and the denial of 
tenure on the bases of lack of criteria 
for one of the areas is a departure 
from precedent and violation of duly 
established procedures, 

3. The chancellor's denial refutes a 
draft of faculty evaluation and reward 
issued by his office two weeks prior lo 
the tenure decision. The draft states 
Ihal "a particular faculty retention or 
salary increment decision could be 
enthusiastically positive wilh little 
emphasis on research productivity." 
DeFonso noted her case was an 
exception. 

4. The chancellor never met with 
DeFonso lo discuss the case as is out- 
lined in SD 76-20. Both meetings with 
him, she said, were initialed by her or 
her department, 

5. The denial of her tenure is a 
violation of Purdue University's 
affirmative action policy. 

The grievance was before a panel 
for discussion for six days before a 
decision was reached. The panel, 
DeFonso said, "supported Ihe most 
important of my points and voted 
unanimously in favor of tenure," The 
panel is comprised of live memt&gt;er8 
selected by Purdue University faculty. 

The panel then went to Purdue Uni- 
versity-West Lafayette to meet with 
President Steven Beering concerning 
their decision last March. 

Beering did not make a formal 
announcement to DeFonso, but she 
said, "President Beering wrote a 
memo to members of the panel saying 
that he recommended ! get tenure. 

"I felt that it really sort of affirmed 
the faculty committee role in the 
tenure process. It was nice that it was 
a victory for me, but it was also a 
victory lor the faculty committee. It 
also shows that the appeal process 
works." 

Of three other appeals of tenure 
denial from DeFonso's penultimate 
year, one was overturned by the 
chancellor and two are up for review 
at Indiana University, those of Patrick 
Ashton, assistant professor of 
sociology, and Frank Codispoti, 
assistant professor of political science. 
No decision has been announced in 
either case.

Constitution allows SAB 
to be subdued by senate 



The Students' Government con- 
stitution, far from being a reliable 
guide, actually hinders the effec- 
tiveness of Students' Government. 
This is especially evident as it re- 
lates to the Student Activities 
Board, 

The most glaring fault of the 
constitution as it relates to SAB is 
that it gives the president the 
power to appoint SAB's key offi- 
cials. The president has the power 
to appoint the SAB vice chair, all 
SAB standing-committee directors, 
as well as the governor of student 
activities coordinator and director 
of publicity. 

It would be hard to find a less 
efficient way to handle this. Stu- 
dent body presidents always have 
more appomtments to make than 
friends to fill the posts. Saddling 
the president with up to ten addi- 
tional appointments is illogical. The 
logical person to make These ap- 
pointments would be the SAB chair. 
The SAB chair is the one who 
would know both the requirements 
of the offices and the skills of the 
candidates. Of course, what hap- 
pens in practice is that the SAB 
chair recommends to the president 
names that are acceplea without 



question. Even so, the next draft of 
the constitution should codify this 
practice. 

The constitution also mentions 
committees and offices that have 
not been filled in years. There is no 
student activities coordinator or 
governor of publicity. The con- 
stitution mentions that certain SAB 
members shall serve on the SAB 
executive committee, without giv- 
ing a clue as to what the committee 
is supposed to do. 

The best solution would be to 
delete from the constitution man- 
dates for the existence of any given 
committees, instead giving the 
body the power to create and a- 
bolish committees that reflect the 
changing needs of students. For 
instance, prior to last semester 
SAB had a films committee. 

Although the movies SAB was 
showing were blockbusters and the 
price of admission was low, at- 
tendance was dismal. So last Oc- 
tober SAB members decided to 
disband the films committee. This 
was certainly a wise move, but its 
constitutionality is dubious. Once 
again, Students' Government is 
frustrated by its own constitution. 



Religion is in one's self

college find in the in-

Commentary 



While I was relaxing in 
le courtyard outside 
Kcttler Hall some time 
two young men ap- 
proached me and in- 
troduced themselves. 
From their exuberance 
ilri)l''iipf)ai't'nt sincerity. I 
redlTzdd their appeal to 
talk to me about God's 
grace and plan for salva- 
tion was genuine. 

The two were from the 
IPFW Campus Ministry 
organization, and they 
were witnessing on that 
particular day. I had been 



a churchgoer as a child, 
and as a teenager I had 
made it a point to con- 
tribute 10 percent of my 
income to religious organ- 
izations, including Jimmy 
SwQggart Ministries; my 
conversotion with the two 
students was thus one of 
mutual understanding and 
not conversion, 

After they left I exam- 
ined the booklet they had 
given me Copyright in- 
formation revealed thai 
my copy was only one of 
one billion printed (or dis- 
tribution by organizations 
like Campus Ministry The 
tract is completely un- 
offcnsivc; no one religious 
denomination is touted as 
superior to any other, and 
basic concepts, such as 
Jesus Christ bridging the 
gulf between man and 
God, are familiar to most 
people, 

I reflected awhile 
longer. How important is 



it to separate church offi- 
cials from the religions 
they are supposed to rep- 
resent? Many people have 
become embittered be- 
cause of scandals in- 
volving prominent tele- 
vision evangelists or be- 
cause of moral failure 
within their own con- 
gregations, but church 
figureheads cannot pos 
sibly be representative of 
every member of a de- 
nomination. The real re- 
ligion must take place 
within one's self 

A fairly typical cycle 
exemplifies many of my 
friends' lives. They party 
Monday through Soturday 
and go through the mo- 
tions of repenting of the 
entire past week on 
Sunday. I can't help won- 
dering if they're missing 
the inner solitude and 
purpose in hfe that the two 
would-be converters

Media needs to notify public 



Apparently the AIDS epi- 
demic is less serious than 
originally believed. Tragi- 
cally, many people may 
have come to this conclu- 
sion because of the media's 
growing disinterest in por- 
traying Acquired Immune 
Deficiency Syndrome as a 
local, national and world- 
wide problem. When AIDS 
first surfaced, a person 
couldn't turn on the tele- 
vision or radio or pick up a 
newspaper without being 
bombarded by news reports 
about the disease, but in 
recent months AIDS stones 
have rapidly decreased in 
frequency. 

Is AIDS no longer news- 
worthy? Since the majority 
of the world's population 
engages in sexual relations, 
each of those people share 
the potential risk of con- 
tracting AIDS. Sooner or 
later, experts predict, every 
person will see an ac- 
quaintance succumb to the 



disease. Over 30 people in 
Allen County have l&gt;een 
diagnosed as having AIDS, 
and thousands more are in- 
fected in the rest of the 
United States. Such facts 
cannot t&gt;e transmitted to the 
public through osmosis^ the 
media have a responsibility 
to convey to their source of 
revenue, the public, the 
ever-present danger AIDS 
represents. 

The AIDS issue may al- 
ready seem overblown to 
some, but it isn't going 
away soon and the number 
of cases is increasing. In- 
formation is AIDS' greatest 
enemy, and the media may 
disseminate that informa- 
tion more effectively if it is 
not buried on page nine. 

The first thing the media 
must do is erase the stereo- 
types of AIDS carriers. 
Prostitutes, IV drug users 
and homosexuals are not 
the only people with AIDS, 
nor are they the only people 



in danger of contracting the 



The media must dis- 
continue highlighting only 
sensational AIDS stories. 
Reporting just the con- 
troversial portions of the 
Kinseys' new book about 
AIDS or speculating on 
which national celebrities 
will get the disease is not 



responsible journalism, 

A significant contribution 
could be made by the media 
through goodwill advertis- 
ing. Condom commercials 
can be no worse than those 
for tampons or douches. 
Locally, WFFT-TV has al- 
ready shown community 
responsibility by broad- 
casting "Red Cross Blood 



Alerts" when certain types 
of blood are needed. Run- 
ning similar advertisements 
encouraging regular AIDS 
testing and safe sex could 
be very effective. 

The message is simple. 
Abstinence. Safe sex. Re- 
sponsibility. The messen- 
gers should be newspapers, 
radios and televisions.

Tenure 

Continued Trom page 1 

The standards for tenure 
differ between III and 
Purdue. On the Purdue 
side, promotion to associate 
professor and tenure are 
linked more closely than on 
the Indiana side. "Under 
Purdue rules, tenure along 
occurs only under very 
special cases." Worthley 
said. In ascending order the 
faculty ranks are assistant 
professoi;, associate pro- 
fessor and full professor. 
"Associate professor is a 
very high and respected 
rank. Only about 10 percent 
of your faculty will be come 
full professors," Worthley 



said. 

"I have a very low ex- 
pectation for service from 
untenured faculty mem- 
bers, l&gt;ecause I think it is 
next to impossible for un- 
tenured faculty members to 
demonstrate excellence in 
service," Bullion said. 

Worthley then said 
Purdue members usually 
submit cases for promotion. 
A promotion case includes a 
primary area of excellence, 
a secondary area, and a 
tertiary area of excellence, 
Worthley said. The areas 
are teaching, research and 
service. 



On the Indiana side, 
faculty members must show 
competence in three areas. 
Even so, Bullion recom- 
mends that faculty prove 
excellence in the area of 
research. "A new faculty 
member should expect in 
the first five years to pub- 
lish at least three refereed 
journal articles in order to 
t&gt;e promoted and gain 
tenure," Bullion said. 
Bullion believes that excel- 
lence in research is easier 
to prove than in the other 
areas because research is 
more tangible 



Long keeps students fit 



Couch potatoes of the 
world, jump off those 
sofas! Oh. can't jump? 
Try rolling off! Have too 
many pretzels and t&gt;eer or 
late night snacks taken 
their loir Are clothes too 
snug',' Is climbing stairs a 
drag? Is running out of the 
question? Rejoice! Help is 
on the way. 

Too often, people com- 
plain about not having 
energy, l)eing loo tired or 
not having the time to 
exercise. Tina Long, 
assistant director of the 
Women's Bureau, says 
this is nonsense. "Every- 
one has to realize that 
being fit isn't something 
you do for six weeks; it's 
a way of life, and you 
have to make time for it." 
Long, along with Judy 
Trikones, fitness/wellness 
coordinator of the Athletic 
Center, has developed 
several different times 
and methods of helping 
the student get tit. 

Long does a body- 
pulsing, muscle-aching 
aerobics routine on 
Mondays. Wednesdays, 



and Fridays al the Ath- 
letic Center. From 8:30 to 
9:30 a.m., one can wake- 
up and shake-up every 
part of his body. Showers 
and lockers are available. 
IPFW also offers Trikones 
on channel 23 al 9:30 on 
Monday, Wednesday, and 
Friday, with two more 
shows on Tuesday and 
Thursday at 5:00. There is 
also the new conditioning 
fitness area in the Athletic 
Center that boasts sixteen 
different nautilus ma- 
chines. A Saturday clinic 
from 1 1 : 00 to noon leaches 
how to use them. More 
important, all of this is 
free with a student ID It 
can't g^t much better un- 
less students hire someone 
else to exercise tor them. 
This is a great concept, 
but it offers no results! 

Give it a try. Don't 
follow the natural tenden- 
cies of a couch potato to 
become part of the couch. 
Jump up, jump around 
and join the healthy 
bunch. Get fit - student:, 
will be glad they did. For

Celebration commences 



By JIM GOUDY 

The graduating class of 
1988 has only a few weeks 
remaining before it 
reaches its goal. It has 
taken many students a 
number of years lo fulfill 
their objeclives. 

On Wednesday, May 11, 
the graduating class of 
1988 will l&gt;e recognized in 
commencement exercises 
al the Fort Wayne 
Memorial Coliseum, 

Commencement is not 
just for students complet- 
ing their degree require- 
ments in May. Those 
students who finished in 
December as well as those 
who will finish this 
summer are eligible to 
participate. The cere- 
mony, which begins at 
7:30 p.m., will last ap- 
proximately two hours. 
Detailed instructions re- 
garding the ceremony will 
be given to graduates 
upon the purchase of their 
caps and gowns from 
Follefs Bookstore, Caps 
and gowns will be 
available in Follet's dur- 
ing the week of March 
H-19 They will also be 
available the week of 
April 18-23; however, dur- 
ing this week a late 
charge will be assessed. In 
addition to caps and 
gowns, Follet's will 
carry commencement 
invitations. 

In addition to com- 



mencement there will be a 
graduation celebration, 
which win be held on 
Saturday, May 7. from 4 to 
8 p.m. This celebration is 
for the entire graduating 
class and will be held in 
the mall area between the 
Helmke Library and Walb 
Memorial Union, The cele- 
bration will feature food, 
live band music and danc- 
ing. A minimal tee of $2.50 
per person will be charged 
in order to cover the cost 
of the party, The purpose 
ot this festival is to bring 
the class together for one 
last bash, Alt graduating 
class members are urged 
lo invite friends and rela- 
tives to join in the cele- 
bration. Tickets for the 
party may be purchased 
al the Sweel Shop in Walb 
Memorial Union from 8 lo 
5pm,. April 11-22. 

The graduation cele- 
bration, hosted by 
Chancellor Thomas 
Wallace, will also feature 
the presentation of the 
class gift. The class gift 
will be presented to 
Chancellor Wallace be- 
tween 4 and 5 p.m. at the 
celebration. Fund raising 
for the class gilt is being 
approached in a new way 
this year. The new ap- 
proach involves a cam- 
paign for contributions 
from the graduating class 
members. All graduating 
seniors will receive a 



letter with a listing of 
possible gifts and a ballot

FoUett's serves students' needs 



By KIM SCROGHAM 
SUf r WrIUr 

Is there a special occa- 
sion coming up? A birth- 
day? An anniversary? A 
holiday or other event? 
Where can a student get 
those specific books and 
supplies needed for the 
summer and fall classes? 
Among many other people, 
IPFW students and faculty 
have complete access to 
the largest independent 
family of academic 
bookstores. 

Welcome to Follett's 
Bookstore, located in 
Kettler Hall. One thing that 
many students may not 
know is that Follett's is not 
a separate university or- 
ganization but is a memt&gt;er 
of the Follett Retail Group 
of Chicago. 111. This com- 
pany operates more than 
225 college and university 
bookstores across the 
United States. 

Although there are many 
policies and guidelines for 
the bookstore to follow, the 
relationship between Fol- 
lett's and the university is 
very close. 




According to Ron 
Wyckoff, who spent 17 
years in Rio Hondo Book- 
store in Wahittier, Calif,, 
and who just recently re- 
located to IPFW in Janu- 
ary, said, "The primary 
goal of the bookstore is to 
provide services for the 
students." Some of these 
services include the buy- 
back policy, special orders, 
refunds, the privilege to 
use checks and credit 
cards and offering a wide 
selection of class rings for 
sale. 

The prices of textbooks 
may seem outrageous to 
students, but Wyckoff ex- 
plains that the book prices 
are a universal "pay and 



buy." All of the text mate- 
rial is priced by the pub- 
lishers. The dollar amount 
adds up through the proc- 
ess of writing, shipping and 
selling. But the large 
selection of used textbooks 
reduces a student's total 
book bill in the long run. 

Follett's Bookstore hires 
students on a regular basis 
and presently operates 
with a staff of seven. Two 
out of the seven are IPFW 
students. Anyone inter- 
ested in working for the 
bookstore and earning 
some extra money over the 
summer should see 
Wyckoff and bring a 
schedule of summer 
classes so he can schedule 



around any conflicts. 

For the student's benefit 
are many more texttxwks, 
novels, magazines, period- 
icals and fiction books that 
are not required for any 
classes but are sold for en- 
joyment purposes. As soon 
as something new comes 
out in the bookstore mar- 
ket, Follett's is one of the 
first liookstores to receive 
the merchandise. A lot of 
feedback and community 
service has opened many 
new opportunities for pro- 
viding Uie various supplies 
to Follett's. Currently the 
bookstore offers Hoosier 
and Boilermaker sports- 
wear, greeting cards, cal- 
culators, coffee mugs, 
stuffed animals, pasters 
and materials required for 
classes, 

Follett's Bookstore pro- 
vides a service in the best 
interests of the students, 
Follett's Bookstore is here 
on campus as a conven- 
ience and as a learning and 
educational source for 
everyone. 

Store hours are Mon.- 
Thurs.. 9-B; Sat.. 10-1; Fri„ 
9-3; closed Sunday.

Women's Center presents workshops 



By JENNIFER L. GRIGGS 
Staff Writer 

The IPFW Women's Cen- 
ter hosted two special 
workshops, cosponsored by 
the IPFW Women's Studies 
and the psychological sci- 
ences department. On 
March 23 and 24, the 
Women's Center success- 
fully addressed two im- 
portant issues concerning 
children in crisis and 
women and aging. 

Wednesday afternoon's 
discussion. "The Impact of 
Aging on Women." was led 
by Karen S. Harlow, Ph,D., 
and Elaine Blakemore, 



Ph.D. The discussion was 
scheduled to address the 
importance society puts on 
the "look young" image for 
women. The center's staff 
worker Terri Worman has 
attempted to design the 
programs to discuss issues 
that are not addressed in a 
formal setting elsewhere on 
campus. They are issues 
women have brought up on

Hitchcock changes frequently 



By DAVE WISNER 
Staff Writer 

Robyn Hitchcock and the 
Egyptians 
"Globe of Frog" 
A&amp;M Records 

If you've never heard of 
Robyn Hitchcock, it's a 
shame. Hitchcock has been 
producing some of rock's 
most varied alternative 
music, ranging from boring 
to phenomenal. With about 
ten albums to his name, 
Hitchcock has blended his 
own unique sound into a 
style imitated by a number 
of different musicians. 
Soimding like a cross be- 
tween Syd Barrett and 
Donovan. Hitchcock really 
gets it together on this 
album, laying out ten wild, 
cavorting songs of madness 



and existential awareness. 



Revieiv 



As with most of his al- 
bums, Hitchcock changes 
mood and tone frequently 
throughout the record. 
Songs like "Tropical Flesh 
Mandala," "Sleeping with 
Your Devil Mask," and 
"Unsettled" can really 
rock, yet songs such as 
' ' Luminous Rose, ' ' 
"Chinese Bones," and "A 
Globe of Frogs" are murky 
and dream-like. This is by 
far a much better piece of 
work than his previous 
album "Element of Light," 
which seemed bored with 
itself all too often. 

One element that makes 
"Globe of Frogs" so 
dynamic is the musicians 



Hitchcock has recruited for 
the tracks. Back-up music- 
ians include Squeeze's Andy 
Metcalfe and Glen Tiibrook, 
and even R.E,M,'s Peter 
Buck drops in for some 
guitar work on two of the 
songs. 

After getting bored by 
some of Hitchcock's recent 
music, I am very happy to 
have "Globe of Frogs" 
change that opinion. Just 
because you've never heard 
the man, don't pass on this 
music. Hitchcock's liner 
notes on the back cover are 
a pure delight, and if you 
can decipher them, they 
might give you a clue as to 
what "A Globe of Frogs" is 
really about. Produced by 
Hitchcock, Metcalfe, Wind- 
sor, and Collier, 

"'" out of five stars.

You Won't Notice Any Difference, 
But Your Country Will. 

Some young men arc confused about Selective Service registration. They 
sometimes confuse registration wiih the draft or with enlisting for military service. 
The fact is, registration is not the same as either of those. 

Registration is simply a way of maintaining a list of names which could save our 
country six vital weeks in responding to a national emergency. And registration is a 
requirement for federal student loans, job training benefits and most federal 
employment. 

The five minutes you spend filling out a simple form ai the post office won't 
change you, In fact, registration won't makej'ow any different. But it H'///make a 
difference to your country. 

When you turti 18, register with Selective Service 
It's quick. It's easy. And it's the law.
