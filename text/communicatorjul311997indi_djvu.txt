Answerins the traffic/parkins problem 



Bv Gail Ruble Crawford 
Staff Reporter 

If you are reading Tbe 
Communicator ihis week, chances 
are. you made it itirougb Fort 
Wayne's many iraffie njgblmares 
and go! to campus in one piece 

However, in case you somehow 
avoided noticing, there is major con- 
sliuciion going on in several areas. 
both in Fod Wayne anJ on campus, 
that will affect students, faculty and 
visitors this fall semester 

Firsi, local Fori Wayne road 
consUuclion is playing havoc with 
how you can get into campus and 
campus consmiclion is aifecting 
how you can enter campus itself. 

Second, there are major changes 
in ihe "B" parking sKuaiion with 
which siudcnls and visitors need (o 
be familiar. 

The biggest headache thai you 
will encounter is die road ard cam- 
pus construction Currcnily, ihe city 
is replacing the bridge over St. 
Joseph nver on Coliseum Boulevard 
in front of Memorial Stadium. 
Because of die construcLon, there is 
only one lane open over die bridge 
in each direction This project is 
scheduled to be Tmished in mid-fall. 

The current campus construc- 
tion projects have been hampered by 
the recent rains. In an e-mail inter- 
view. Lauren Denharlog. chief of 
university police and safely, and 
David Leeka, director of public 
safely, said there are two projects 
under conslniciion on campus: the 
new science building and the new 
parking garage, as well as the road- 
work assoaaled with the garage 

The expected completion dales 
for both are late spnng or early sum- 
mer l'W8 

"Ii is unlikely at this point thai 
the m^n entrance al Lawshc I&gt;rive 
and SR 37 will be open when class- 
es begin on August 25 . . . Lawshe 



Drive will be opened as soon a.s pos- 
sible. We anticipate with the rirsi 
two weeks of classes Thai estimate, 
of course, is dependent on the 
weather al.so." Denhanog and Leeka 
said. 

The unexpected weather has 
created a campus traffic nightmare 
Tbe only entrances to campus will 
be from the north or souUi on St Joe 
Road, the north-only entrance off of 
Crescent Avenue and from either the 
south or east off of Ihe resmcted 
lanes al Coliseum Boulevard. 

The bulk of the campus traffic 
will be forced to enter at the St. Joe 
Road entrance, which may lead 10 
tardy students and auto accidents. 

When asked what the university 
will do 10 alleviate diese problems, 
Denhartog and Leeka responded. 
"There is not much we can do to 
avoid traffic congestion with one 
entrance/exit clo:&gt;ed and another 
restricted due 10 bridge conslruc- 
bon " 

As if getting to campus will not 
be dilTicult enough, there is a new 
"B" parking system to deal with 
Starting with the tall semester "B" 
parking permits are no longer 
ret]uired or issued. All students will 
now pay a flat S2-per-credit hour fee 
to park in a "B" lot The elimination 
of the "B" parking pcrtnii has sever- 
al advantages for both students and 
facuhy 

First, students will no longer 
have to worry about moving permits 
from one vehicle to anodier or park- 
ing at meters This will help students 
avoid being die unlucky recipient of 
a parking ticket if they forget their 
permit or don't have enough quarters 
to feed a parking meter 

Second, this change reduces the 
usual workload on the Traffic 
Appeals Board, as well as the bur- 
sar's office and Police and Safety. 
They will not have to issue the per- 
mits to students, keep records of the

Getting around campus may be a litlte diHicult during the tiisl weeks of school. 



issuance or enforce proper usage. 

This change is al.so a bonus for 
visitors who can now park in any 
normal "B" lot on campus free of 
charge. 

"With ail die special events that 
occur conunuuusly on this campus. 
parking enforcement was being sus- 
pended in certain areas of campus 



on an almost daily basis in the past 
to accommodate visitors to IPFW,' 
Leeka and Denhanog said. 

This change also eliminates the 
designation of "free" lots on the 
north end of campus 

There are several things you can 
do to make getting to campus this 
fall as easy on your stress level (and 



automobile insurance) as possible. 

•First, plan your route to campus 
out before you leave your house. 
Traffic at the St. Joe entrance will be 
backed up at peak class times. Try to 
take alternate routes to enter cam- 
pus, such as from the south off 
Anthony Boulevard 



•Second, leave for class as early 
as possible to avoid as much of the 
impending nightmare as possible. 

•Third, keep calm, if a "situa- 
tion" (ak.a an accident) arises. The 
police department will be monitor- 
ing traffic and will be nearby to 
assist, if needed. 



Dean of students bids farewell to campus, offers advice 




By Nol Becklev 
Editor 



Manan Zimmennan. dean of students, relires in September. 



Campus 



After nearly 20 years at IPFW, 
Marian Zimmerman has decided to 
retire. 

For the last 11 years, Zimmerman has 
been one of die mast recognizable faces on 
campus as Dean of Students. 

"1 think you should leave when you feel 
you're on top and you feel happy," 
Zimmennan said. 

Zimmerman said she fell she had 
accomplished a great deal during het tenure 
as dean, but still is disappointed she will not 
be able to see the completion of some of her 
ideas. 

Some things Zimmennan said she 
would like to see improved are retention 



rates, student success rates, academic advis- 
ing, supplemental inslrucuon outside of 
class and student leadership classes. 

One major area Zimmerman sees need 
for improvement is at die orientation level. 

She criticized Ihe way orientation has 
been done in die past two years. 

"We're not doing an orientation We're 
doing a regisualion," Zimmennan said. 

She spoke of a time 10 years ago. when 
the faculty and staff had an orientation cook 
out. The faculty and staff would cook all the 
hoi dogs and hamburgers. 

Zimmerman said she feels confident the 
intenm dean of students, Donna Bialik, will 
be a sU'ong ally to students. 

Bialik was appointed Tuesday morning 

"I couldn't be happier about that 
appointment She'll be be a great student 
advocate." Zimmennan said 

Zimmennan said was proud about the 



increase of student complaints that have 
come through her office. 

"1 attribute that to students knowing 
where to go," she said 

She said she was doubtful there will be 
a full time dean of students after June 30 
when Bialik's interim term ends. 

If dien; will be anodier dean of students, 
Zimmerman advised thai the person should 
go into every situation with a completely 
open mind. 

"If you don't always believe, you will 
get burned out," Zimmerman said. 

Ilic duties would he spread out among 
other campus adminisuators, but the bulk of 
the responsibility would fall under tbe 
office of the vice chancellor of student 
affairs. 

"We need to have a dean of students 
mentahty in a vice chancellor's position," 
Zimmerman said.

Zimmerman on campus. 

Tbey don'i seem lo be doing 
enough. We even wonder if the posi- 
tion of dean of students will remain. 

If that position is eliminated, 
who will argue on behalf of tbe stu- 
dents? Will we have anyone with 
any sort of power to stand up to tbe 
administration'' 



We doubi iL The dismantling of 
tbe Dean of Students Office is 
already taking plac« We do believe 
that E&gt;onna Bialik will do a decent 
job as inlerim dean of students, but 
her position will be phased out in 
July 1998. 

What will happen then? Will we 
have a student advocate to tbe 
administration? Maybe. 

Bul then again, wbai are tbe 
odds of the adminisiraiion wanting a 
student advocate withm their cadre: 
100 to 1 maybe SO to P 

We'll be dismissed and forgot- 
ten if tbe administration decides to 
eradicate the dean of students posi- 
tion. 

The students have lost oae great 
student advocate in Zimmerman, but 
losing the Dean of Students Office 
would be an even greater crime. 

Zimmerman can never be 
replaced, but we cm get a new dean 
of students

.ne of the required 
[texts for my summer 
Bioanthropology 
class is "The Dragons of 
Eden" by Dr. Carl Sagan 
Written twenty years ago, 
the book contains Sagan's 
viewpoints on various 
issues. Some of these 
include the progression of 
human intelligence, extrater- 
restrial life, why we dream 
and much more. Towards tbe end of the volume 
he addrcs.scs tbe topic of ccanputers. 

In 1977. Sagan believed thai computers (quite 
primitive then, compared to today's standards) 
represented the human race's connection to the 
future. "In another generation. I think thai com- 
puters will be treated as a perfectly natural— or at 
least commonplace— aspect of our lives." Sagan 
foretold prophetically I'm not quite sure just bow 
commonplace be thought they would be. but his 
prediction appears to have been quite accurate, if 
not a httic underestimated. 

There seems to be no doubt that the 
"Information Age "-as the computer era has been 
dubbed-has introduced great benefits with its 
advanced technology and instant communication 
capabilities We can e-mail somebody instead of 
buying stamps and envelopes to mail a letter. We 



can also control a robot module on Mars with 
meticulous precision and even preview new 
music without wasung 15 bucks on a CD or rely- 
ing on word of mouth. 

But, as always, progress comes with a cost. 
Breakthroughs in technology can oAen lead lo an 
over-reliance on or blind faith in machines. 

Take a relatively "old" technological break- 
through for example: the pocket calculaior. 1 can 
remember when grocery stores would not allow 
the use of this devise by cashiers for fear of it 
being overuiilized. This potential for abuse was 
thought to possibly lead to a decrease in the 
cashier's apphcation of common sense and men- 
tal alertness in deabng with customers. Now. I'm 
not sure if 1 can speak for anybody else, but it sure 
seems to me that there are many checkout lanes 
out there being run by some pretty dim bulbs 
Coincidence or not? 

Speaking of grocery stores, most in Fort 
Wayne seem to have adopted the use of electron- 
ic scanners being run by a computer system. 1 can 
see the logic in this technology. There's no more 
stamping of each item with a price or punching in 
each price at tbe checkout lane. Less hassles and 
a more pleasant shopping experience, right? 
Maybe it's just me. but lines don't really seem to 
move quicker Also, many items fall through ihe 
cracks and either get misplaced or are forgotten to 
be entered into the computer system at all. 



Consequently, tbe scanners can frequendy con- 
tribute to a lengthier checkout period 

There is also another area of the computer 
revolution that causes me lo ponder while in 
between zipping from school to work, weren't 
computers supposed to save us time? 

Our schedules are as hurried and hectic as 
ever. Why else would someone pull out in front of 
me just to gel to a slop sign two seconds earher? 
There doesn't seem to be more leisure time with 
computers "helping" us On the contrary, I sense 
that we only try 10 cram more activiues inlo our 
already jam-packed, transitory existence. 

Indeed, computers and machines have 
enabled us to do more with the time that we have. 
Tbe question is, how much of thai lime is spent 
accomphshing worthwhile endeavors? Do not fail 
lo understand that in this race we call life, tbe 
only fmish hne is death, with tbe grand prize 
being a brand new pine box. So, slow down and 
discover how much you've missed from life, vic- 
ariously through computers and machines. 

Simply stated, although Sagan was correct in 
believing thai computers would play a substantial 
pan in humankind's future, it is of prime essence 
thai we apply this tool utilizing our utmost intel- 
ligence and wisdom If we don't, then we have 
only ourselves to blame if our species turns into 
the Susan B Anthony dollar of history

Professor criticizes coverage, accuracy 



To THE Editor: 

Ever since implementation of 
the Technology Fee ai IPFW. I have 
served as a faculty representative on 
the body determining allocation of 
these special funds collected from 
students. And ftom the beginning, 
the money has been allocated for 
precisely the types of entras request- 
ed by the students who voted in a 
referendum lo impose this "tax" 
upon themselves Technology Fee 
funds have brought open computer 
labs and student e-mail and the 
World Wide Web and dial-up access 
and several other benefits to all 
IPFW students who seek them. 

On June 24, the committee allo- 
cating Ibis money — a body consist- 
ing largely of administrators — voted 
unanimously lo continue funding 
precisely the same types of projects 
in the future So you can imagine 
my amazement upon reading your 
July 17 editorial's announcement 
alleging the administration "is try- 
ing to coerce the IPSGA to make 
some of the funds available for a 
'high-speed computer for shared use 



by at least four IPFW science and 
engineering departments'" Tbe 
minutes of the meeting, bom which 
your quotation came, specifically 
Slated that tbe high-speed computer 
in question would be funded entire- 
ly itom nonuniversiiy sources, no 
member of the funding committee 
suggested — or even imagined — that 
tbe Technology Fee would be an 
appropriate source of funding for 
this project. 

Nor was there any discussion in 
our committee about using 
Technology Fee money for what 
your editorial goes on to label 
"some super-duper overhead projec- 
tor" for classrooms Actually, .sever- 
al expensive projectors capable of 
putting high-resolution computer 
and television images onto class- 
room screens without plunging the 
rooms into darkness are being pur- 
chased by IPFW But not a dime of 
Technology Fee funding was 
requested or wdl be used for these 
devices. They arc being furnished at 
tbe request of faculty in several dis- 
ciplines and, being ponable, will be 
used in classrooms campuswide. 



They are being paid for by a special 
stale appropriation. 

Students at IPFW have legiti- 
mate gripes But Tbe Communicator 
does not serve the interests of stu- 
dents or of accuracy by claiming 
that, in this case, "tbe will of ihe stu- 
dents is being subvened by ihe 
capricious desire of a few adminis- 
trators " Happily, capricious admin- 
istrators jusi decided unanimously 
to keep faith with students on use of 
the Technology Fee.

Saying good-bye to Justice William Brennan 



By Nol Beckley 

Eorron 

Tuesday, one of the mosi influ- 
ential Americans of the lasibalf cen- 
tury was buried in Arlington 
National Cemetery 

Fonner Supreme Coun Justice 
William Brennan died July 24 leav- 
ing behind a 34-year legacy of judi- 
ciaJ activism wbicb. m reesni years, 
bas been criticized Brennan 
authored what could be called tbe 
most imponanl constitutional deci- 
sion concerning ibe First 
AmendmenL 

Brennan said in a 1987 speech 
about the Constitution, "One thing 
the old parcbiDieni is not is a cbina 
doll that has to be prelected from the 
regular world by a good layer of cot- 
ion wool. It is a tough old soldier 
that's collected quite a few 
respectable dents in the line of 
duly " 

Brennan wrote, in N Y. Tunes v 
Sullivan, 'A rule compelling the 
critic of offidal conduct to guaran- 
tee Ihe Uuih of all his factual asser- 
tion^-&lt;ind to do « on pain of libel 
JudgmenLs virtually unlimited m 
amount leads lo . . . 'sclf-censor- 
sbip '" 

The legacy of tbe N.Y. Times v. 
Sullivan case rcmaias as the defini- 
tion of the term "actual malice" in 
libel cases. Brennan defined actual 
malice pubUshing something with 
"knowledge that it was false or with 
reckless disregard of whether it was 
false or noL" Ralph Holsinger, pro- 



fessor emenius of journalism al 
Indiana University and Jon Paul 
Dilts, associate dean and associate 
professor of journalism at Indiana 
University, wrote in their text, 
"Seldom has a single paragraph in a 
Supreme Court Decision brought 
about such a revolutionary change 
in the law. With that paragraph, the 
Court shifted most of tbe burden of 
proof in libel suits brought by pubUc 
olTicials against the news media. " 

"People have come to realize 
that tbe so-called 'Warren Court' was 
actually tbe Brennan Court. " said 
James Fcnton, associate faculty in 
the journalism departmenL Fenlon 
teaches a course on media law and is 
a Fori Wayne attorney 

Fenton spoke about Ibe fact that 
Brennan was a devout Catholic and 
went to mass everyday, but many of 
his decisions seem lo run counter lo 
his beliefs 

"He was able to see his role as 
justice as very distinct from his per- 
sonal predilections. I sec that as a 
mark of a great Supreme Court 
Justice, " Fenlon said 

Fenton called tbe NY Tunes v 
Sullivan, in which Biennan wrote 
the majority opinion, as one of the 
three most impwtant cases concern- 
ing Constiluliona! Law. the other 
Iwo cases being Brown v Board of 
Education and Mapp v Ohio The 
Brown case concerned iniegration 
of public schools and the Mapp case 
dealt wiih tbe Fourth Amendment. 

"He was more imponanl than 
any single president in the last 25 



years," Fenton said 

President Dwight Eisenhower 
nominated Brennan. thinking he was 
a moderate, to the Supreme Court in 
1956. Eisenhower also wanted lo 
appoint a Caihohc to the Court. 
Later. Eisenhower said choosing 
Brennan for the Court was one of 
two mistakes be made as president. 

Fenton said there is a precedent 



for Justices to become more liberal 
as ibey serve on the Court. Justices 
are appomted for life and are not 
beholden to presidents or ideology 

Brennan retired from the Coun 
in 1990 afier suffering a slroite 
President George Bush replaced him 
on Ibe Court with David Souler. 
Souteroftenconsulled widi Brennan 
and has emerged as a moderate

Bui we've also got a lot going

— "Damn," Matchbox 20, 
Yourself or someone like you 

Well. well. Imagine thaL 1 read 
an article in "Time" magazine 
recently about us. tbe so-called 
"Cenetaiion X." Guess whai? We 
aren't tbe "slackers" and "losers" 
thai we were supposed to be. In fact, 
we're turning out to be a generation 
of go-gettcfs. Uh. big shock 

The article cited a recently 
released study (apUy dubbed the 
"New American Dream" study) that 
compared our generation (born 
beiween 1965 and 1977) widi two 
other generations— our parents (the 
ever-present "Baby Boomers," bom 
from 1946 to 1964) and our grand- 
parents (the "Matures." bom from 
1909 lo 1945) 

Tlie results of this shocked Ibe 
researchers senseless. Turns out, 
we're absolutely nothing like we 
were purported to be In fact, we're 
more like our grandparents than 
our parents. We are more tcchno- 
logically-savvy. enuepreneurial- 
mindcd and ecologically-oriented 
Ihan any generation before us. Nifty, 
huh? 

Okay, I, for one. find Ibis whole

were "supposed " to be It's impossi- 
ble to guess what a generauon will

We've shocked everyone; maybe 
we've even shocked ourselves. 
Whatever Ibe case, we've decided 
thai no one should define our gener- 
ation but US There's turning oul to 
be a lot of power in that reahzation. 
A power that we're putting to good

"1 love

bale relation- 
ships are unfor- 
tunate, yet most 
close friendships 
have these at 
some lime 
Remember tbe friend dial hated 
you because tbe guy she liked was 
after you? Or how alxiui the fnend 
that you hated because when she 
met your friends they thought die 
sun rose and set on ber-and her 
alone. Some friendships have never 
had to deal with any major conflicts; 

however, in 

some cases, the -■ ^^^" 

occasional 
insensitive 
remark or action 
can bring emo- 
tions to the sur- 
face and make 
tensions run 
rampant 

Throughout 
this past ye^. I 
have been in 
these same situa- 
tions and my 
biggest question 
is, how do you 
gel past them? 
Do you try to 
talk diings out? 
Or should you 
give up, cop an 
altitude and wail 
for them to come 
to you? 

In my situa- 
tions. 1 have 

been on both ^__^^^^^^^ 
sides of the S^^^^^^^^s 
issue. I've been 

die jealous one as well as die inno- 
cent one 1 have yet lo figure out 
which is the wor^i of the two 

Imagine you have a great fnend 
from years ago that you decide to 
visit with anodier good fnend. It 
seems that nghl off the bat. your two 
friends begin to "click" and you 
quickly feel left out. You soon won- 
der to yourself. "Why did I ever 
introduce these two? Id be so much 
happier if I had never brought 
him/her altnig with me!" You begin 
to believe that everyone loves this 
new friend more than diey do you 
and wonder how and why she/he 
stole tbe spotlight. You may even be 
so frustrated that you imagine your 



Iwo friends falling for each other 
romantically, when m faci they are 
simply getting to know each other as 
friends 

By being tbe jealous one in this 
siluatirai (assuming you want to talk 
things out), should you try lo talk lo 
the old friend you're visititig? Or 
should you try to discuss it with the 
newer, yet just as close, friend you 
brought on Uie tnp I feel that dis- 
cussing it with both of tlicm is 
important because you should feci 
thai no matter what you say, diings 
will be genuinely taken lo bean by 
those mlended. I have been very 
guilty m die past of nol opening up

ly trying to gel to

There are no

would simply

Andrew Cunanan was born 
August 31.196*) He commined sui- 
cide by shooting himself in the 
moulh about one monlh before his 
Iwenty-eigblh birthday Making his 
own murder the last tragedy in a uail 
of death dial traveled ihc states of 
Minnesota, Illinois. New Jersey, and 
Florida 

Many questions concerning 
Cunanan have surfaced: the most 
basic, yet hardest to answer is why'? 

First, Cuiuruin's choice of vie 
tims. It seemed quite simple to con- 
clude that Cunanan killed because 
of some sort of lover's rage, but that 
doesn't seem plausible, because be 
was not romantically linked with all 
his victims. 

His most famous victim, Gianni 
Versace, appeared to be. ai the most. 
only a casuaJ acquaintance. 

What was the source of his 
rage? Thmgs seemed to be going 
well for Cunanan, who never 
seemed to be at a loss to find an 
older man to su[q&gt;ly him with an 
allowance and expensive cars to 
drive. Such was Ihe hustler life of 
Andrew Cunanan. but somewhere it 
went wrong 

Tbe theory he killed because he 
was HlV-positive has not been 
proved, even after the autopsy.

If he had been, does that really 
explain why at least five people are

Cunanan's motives aside, con- 
sider the fact the FBI had been look-

Bureau of Invesugaiions and the 
Miami Police Department have

used just not work, or were they 
improperly implemented? Gay 
activists lend to think il was the for- 
mer. 

The FBI agents made a big deal 
out of meeting with the gay commu- 
nity, for the purpose of obtaining 
lists of die areas to cover with fliers 
and to canvas for information. The 
thousands of fliers promised did not 
appear until the day afier Versace 
was killed 

Law enforcement ineptitude 
aside, it seems that the FBI and tbe 
Miami Police Department were not 
the only ones who had not encoun- 
lered anyone who behaved like 
Cunanan. 

According to Martin 
Greengrass. a clinical psychologist 
at Aboite Psychological Services, 
"Obviously if there were many other 
cases such as this, maybe there 
would be a pattern (to study)" No 
one seems to want 
to guess as to why 
Cunanan 
began

killing. 
Local psychologists are al a 
loss lo say whether or nol die pos- 
sibility of Cunanan contracting HIV 
from bis victims drove him to mur- 
der. He could have simply liked to 
kill, and as Greengrass says, 
"dioughi he could get away widi it.' 



Andrew Cunanan was clearly 
psychotic. But no one can say 
whether it was a lifelong disorder, 
or one that developed raibersudden- 
ly when be grew disappomied or 
angry with the men thought to be his 
lovers. 

'I can't say if something made 
him crack." slates Greengrass. "but 1 
do know there are people who gel 
into control, in terms of sadistic 
killing and need to kill in order lo 
gel off. Without knowing him. I caii 
only speculate..." 

What does all diis mean for 
homosexuals nationwide? In spite 
of press conferences in Florida 
about taking precautions, one local 
gay man responded Ibis way when 
asked if he IS afraid: "No, because it 
was just (randomly)killing people." 
The conclusion can be made 
ihen. that psychotics come in all 
sexual orientations, and perhaps the 
general public needs to be educated 
on taking precautions, not just one 
minority sector Complacency 
could make victims of us all.

Borders . . . more than just a bookstore 



By Susan Spindlea 
Staff Repomtfl 

If you've been warning to run to 
the border, try ihe one here in town. 
Borders BtxAs, Masic, and Cafe on 
Coldwaier wbere the old Best Buy 
used to be. The Grand opening is 
tbis wccktmd, starting Friday night 
ai 8 p.m. with live entertainmeni by 
Indiana's own Sindacato. 

The weekend will have events 
for children, TTic Cat in the Hat will 
hang out with tbe kids twice on 
Saturday, 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. There 
is also a !;ing-a-long at )1 a.m. with 
Lauren Powell. 

Borders is more ihan a bookstore. 
"The customer needs of Fod Wayne 
will be mei. Whai we buy is dictated 
by what is selling," said Carol 
Tanner. Borders Community 
Relations Coordinator. 

Not only does Borders have 



over 100.000 book titles, they also 
have over 50,000 CD and cassette 
titles and over 8.000 video titles. 
And if, by chance, tbey don't have 
the specific title of a CD. book, or 
video you are looking for they are 
able to special order ii for you at no 
extra charge, provided Ihe title is in 
print. 

Oilier customer services include 
gift certificates, shipping, and free 
gift wrapping year round. 

One impressive sccdon of the 
bookstore is the children's section. 
"It's a bookstore wiUiin the book- 
store," said Tanner, 

Tlic targe area holds many of the 
same features as the adult section. 
for instance there are biographies, 
books in fweign Languages, a sci- 
ence and nature section, plus fun 
reading areas for the children 

Borders is starting a 'Story 
Tune' program where the kids can 



listen to stories or make crafts. 
There is a story time for tiny tots on 
Tuesdays at 10 a.m. and for children 
of all ages on Saturdays at !Oa.m. 

On Fridays in the Borders Cafe 
Espresso there will be live music 
from local lalom. They will have a 
little something for all. from a harp 
soloist to Jazz to rockabilly. 

"It's a wonderful idea," said 
Abby Frost an IPFW student, "the 
kids arc occupied and learning at the 
same time Tbe music is a nice 
added touch for the adults, and 
eiiposes the children to variouss 
musical styles." 

It will be a fun atmosphere for 
Ihe family to enjoy, with no cover 
charge and no alctAol, but plenty of 
coffee and snacks from the Borders 
Cafe. 

There are also book discussion 
groups forming now If you are 
interested in forming a group or

more information (219M71-5598 
Right now there is a Bible study 
group, romance readers group, mys- 
tery readers group and the ever pop- 
ular X-Files group. 

Starting a book club with friends 
who read die same type of fictit&gt;n 
genre may also be housed there, 

Many people have commented on 
losing themselves for a couple of 
hours in the walls of books at 
Borders. 

With the grand opening this 
weekend, there should be no shon- 
age of interesting things lo do at 
Bonders.
